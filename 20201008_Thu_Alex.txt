[00:00.000 --> 00:16.760]  I have taken on the very people that in fact we're worried about. I've taken on the castros
[00:16.760 --> 00:21.080]  of the world. I've taken on the prudence of the world. I've taken on all these dictators.
[00:21.080 --> 00:22.720]  I haven't cozied up to them.
[00:22.720 --> 00:28.280]  As the election approaches the final stretch, the Democrats' campaign of blatant lies ignites
[00:28.280 --> 00:33.960]  like the American cities, their supporters left smoldering in the wake of BLM's Marxist
[00:33.960 --> 00:34.960]  campaign.
[00:34.960 --> 00:40.460]  They're stoking fears about black and brown Americans, lying about how minorities will
[00:40.460 --> 00:41.960]  destroy the suburbs.
[00:41.960 --> 00:46.080]  Ain't nothing left here, so when we start coming to the suburbs, when we come to the
[00:46.080 --> 00:50.160]  government center, then what's all I'm going to do? You see what I'm saying? So, hey, that's
[00:50.160 --> 00:52.160]  just what's going to happen, you know?
[00:52.160 --> 00:58.800]  And they're pinning it all on what's been an overwhelmingly peaceful movement for racial
[00:58.800 --> 01:05.600]  solidarity. It's true. Research backs it up. Only a tiny fraction of demonstrations have
[01:05.600 --> 01:07.920]  had any violence at all.
[01:07.920 --> 01:12.920]  Respectfully, the first lady lied in that video because the protests every one of this
[01:12.920 --> 01:18.760]  country can see the chaos and the burning in these democratic cities. She lives in a
[01:18.760 --> 01:20.400]  very wealthy area.
[01:20.400 --> 01:25.840]  Meanwhile, the far left's Marxist cockroach nests are flagrantly strengthening their seceding
[01:25.840 --> 01:27.440]  communist city-states.
[01:27.440 --> 01:32.560]  Your right-signature fills me with a fire, comrades. I will tell you what, Wheeler. You
[01:32.560 --> 01:38.000]  are a capitalist, a treasurer, a statist, a tyrant. You are nothing to me. You are
[01:38.000 --> 01:43.760]  just scum. You are laying the f***ing seeds for an insurrection on the record, Jeff Singer.
[01:43.760 --> 01:47.400]  It is not a threat. It is a fact, and it's a fact.
[01:47.400 --> 01:51.800]  Gateway Pundit reported, you know you're in Portland when the current mayor who has chased
[01:51.800 --> 01:57.640]  out countless businesses and allowed Antifa and BLM terrorists to destroy the city on
[01:57.640 --> 02:03.400]  a nightly basis for over four months straight is somehow not far enough to the left to appease
[02:03.400 --> 02:04.960]  the voter base.
[02:04.960 --> 02:09.440]  National laughing stock Ted Wheeler is now trailing the polls for his reelection, but
[02:09.440 --> 02:14.440]  not against a candidate that promises to crack down on the rioters, promote businesses, and
[02:14.440 --> 02:20.240]  actually fix the roads. No, of course not. He's losing to a candidate that's even further
[02:20.240 --> 02:22.400]  to the left than he is.
[02:22.400 --> 02:28.800]  Plucky upstart, Sarah Ianorone, who is best known for declaring I am Antifa, now picks
[02:28.800 --> 02:32.920]  up 41 percent of the vote to Wheeler's 30 percent.
[02:32.920 --> 02:40.360]  We have people looking at the graffiti on that courthouse and calling it violence, calling
[02:40.360 --> 02:45.960]  us a violent anarchist for essentially what some people have done is spray paint on a
[02:45.960 --> 02:46.960]  building.
[02:46.960 --> 02:52.600]  The CIA's mockingbird media operation was revealed in 1975 by the church committee.
[02:52.600 --> 02:58.320]  Most of the senators now agree with Chairman Frank Church that the CIA has indeed been
[02:58.320 --> 03:01.000]  a rogue elephant out of control.
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.520]  Forty-five years later, it is at the very least an open conspiracy.
[03:05.520 --> 03:10.880]  The president in that sunset boulevard gesture whipped his mask off in front of the American
[03:10.880 --> 03:13.800]  people on the nightly news last night.
[03:13.800 --> 03:17.240]  So as a doctor whose job it is, you know, take it off, please, don't even put it on
[03:17.240 --> 03:21.640]  the screen. Please take it off because that's going to kill people.
[03:21.640 --> 03:27.160]  What Trump hoped to hide during his American Mussolini balcony stunt was that he was clearly
[03:27.160 --> 03:28.640]  having trouble breathing.
[03:28.640 --> 03:37.080]  A lot of people get riled up and offended that you're comparing the caste system here
[03:37.080 --> 03:45.840]  to Nazi Germany, yet we discover that we were the template for Nazi Germany.
[03:45.840 --> 03:51.080]  Mockingbird is now being weaponized as the military will now go to war with free speech
[03:51.080 --> 03:57.760]  as Defense One reports Air Force US Special Operations Command fund a year-long effort
[03:57.760 --> 04:03.200]  to train a neural net to rank credibility and sort news from misinformation.
[04:03.200 --> 04:08.280]  Primer, a company that on Thursday announced a small business innovation research contract
[04:08.280 --> 04:13.760]  to develop software over the next year to help analysts better and much more quickly
[04:13.760 --> 04:18.640]  survey the information landscape and hopefully detect false narratives that show up in the
[04:18.640 --> 04:19.800]  public space.
[04:19.800 --> 04:25.320]  Primer's neural network technology can scan large amounts of text and extract themes and
[04:25.320 --> 04:30.240]  other information based on the frequency and prominence of words and phrases.
[04:30.240 --> 04:35.800]  If you were unaware that we were in an infowar before, you most certainly have to understand
[04:35.800 --> 04:39.200]  that we are literally in an infowar now.
[04:39.200 --> 04:59.040]  John Bown reporting.
[04:59.040 --> 05:07.120]  Perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications of COVID-19
[05:07.120 --> 05:11.240]  are well beyond what they should be.
[05:11.240 --> 05:15.760]  It's estimated that 200 million people have died.
[05:15.760 --> 05:18.480]  Probably by the time I finish this talk.
[05:18.480 --> 05:23.800]  Joe Biden has always been a congenital liar, part of the establishment for close to 50
[05:23.800 --> 05:24.800]  years.
[05:24.800 --> 05:31.320]  But now, boy, as his brain degenerates, we are seeing walking public dementia on the
[05:31.320 --> 05:34.840]  biggest stage in the world, the 2020 election.
[05:34.840 --> 05:37.840]  There are 370 million people in the United States.
[05:37.840 --> 05:42.760]  If 200 million died from COVID, that'd be more than half of the population, when not
[05:42.760 --> 05:45.400]  even one tenth of 1% have actually died.
[05:45.400 --> 05:50.400]  But him putting these giant lies and these incredibly brain damage statements out is
[05:50.400 --> 05:53.800]  emblematic of the general public being in a trance.
[05:53.800 --> 05:55.960]  How is anyone even putting up with this?
[05:55.960 --> 06:06.800]  It is beyond bizarre.
[06:06.800 --> 06:10.520]  It's Thursday, October 8th, 2020.
[06:10.520 --> 06:15.280]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[06:15.280 --> 06:16.960]  You want to stop tyranny?
[06:16.960 --> 06:24.360]  Well, so does he, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:24.360 --> 06:30.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, the United Nations is openly announcing a desired oversee our elections
[06:30.320 --> 06:36.040]  and is openly discussing putting peacekeeping forces on the streets of the United States.
[06:36.040 --> 06:42.080]  The United Nations is openly declaring war on our country's very existence.
[06:42.080 --> 06:44.200]  Here's the headline of the New York Times.
[06:44.200 --> 06:47.760]  America may need intervention, international intervention.
[06:47.760 --> 06:52.240]  Even Democrats may find it hard to imagine, but the leader of the free world would benefit
[06:52.240 --> 06:55.840]  from United Nations oversight.
[06:55.840 --> 06:59.640]  That means governance, oversight in the thesaurus.
[06:59.640 --> 07:05.320]  It also means governance or rule or control or regulation.
[07:05.320 --> 07:10.840]  Look up oversight in the thesaurus, but they need a cover.
[07:10.840 --> 07:15.960]  And the New York Times says it's race war, which they're preparing to trigger, which
[07:15.960 --> 07:21.200]  the Communist Chinese that own Hollywood have been greedily financing and openly rebuking
[07:21.200 --> 07:27.760]  the US yesterday at the UN saying we deserve to be broken up and the country doesn't deserve
[07:27.760 --> 07:29.240]  to exist.
[07:29.240 --> 07:38.080]  After all, Antifa is a malice organization, no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[07:38.080 --> 07:39.080]  What's wrong?
[07:39.080 --> 07:41.040]  You don't have any black friends?
[07:41.040 --> 07:45.280]  Do you want everyone to think that you're an ally and not a racist?
[07:45.280 --> 07:50.640]  Well, now's your chance to get woke with Black Lives Matter.
[07:50.640 --> 07:57.880]  And we've made it easy in this all new sensational step-by-step instructional video.

[08:44.440 --> 08:51.000]  How to fake a hate crime with your woke instructors Bubba Wallace and Jesse Smollett.
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.720]  What happens if I get continuity or destroy property?
[08:53.720 --> 08:56.680]  Yeah, what happens if they catch me burning this building down?
[08:56.680 --> 08:57.680]  No problem.
[08:57.680 --> 09:02.600]  We've got Soros operatives ready to bail you out and set you free.
[09:02.600 --> 09:03.600]  All charges dropped.
[09:03.600 --> 09:08.160]  That means we can keep rioting over and over again.
[09:08.160 --> 09:09.360]  No worries?
[09:09.360 --> 09:10.920]  No consequences.
[09:10.920 --> 09:12.520]  No s***.
[09:12.520 --> 09:18.240]  Just make sure you check out our GPS map included in this video for a complete list of all
[09:18.240 --> 09:25.040]  the Democrat controlled cities where total anarchy is not only considered peaceful protests,
[09:25.040 --> 09:26.040]  it's also encouraged.
[09:26.040 --> 09:27.040]  So get woke with Black Lives Matter.
[09:27.040 --> 09:28.040]  The building just exploded.
[09:28.040 --> 09:29.040]  Oh my God.
[09:29.040 --> 09:30.040]  Burn that mother f***er down.
[09:30.040 --> 09:31.040]  But wait, there's more.
[09:31.040 --> 09:42.040]  If you act now, we'll throw in this free CD collection of BLS.
[09:42.040 --> 09:51.480]  BLM's greatest hit, sing along with all the woke BLM chants like oink oink bang bang.
[09:51.480 --> 09:54.920]  No borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[09:54.920 --> 10:00.040]  Hey man, is that Black Lives Matter?
[10:00.040 --> 10:01.040]  Hell yeah.
[10:01.040 --> 10:03.040]  We'll turn it up.
[10:03.040 --> 10:11.880]  Higgs in a blanket, Friam like bacon, in their brand new hit single.
[10:11.880 --> 10:23.440]  So order your copy today and get woke with Black Lives Matter.

[10:37.640 --> 10:45.760]  Well that is a powerful new piece of reality based satire at man.videoin2020electioncenter.com.

[10:48.920 --> 10:49.920]  The video's up there.
[10:49.920 --> 10:54.840]  Get woke with Black Lives Matter, three minute piece that is very, very informative.
[10:54.840 --> 10:59.680]  We have Larry Pinkney, one of the founders of the original Black Panther Party who is
[10:59.680 --> 11:04.480]  incredibly smart and eloquent and probably the best person out there to really expose
[11:04.480 --> 11:05.480]  what's happening.
[11:05.480 --> 11:10.720]  He's been in this fight 50 plus years, he'll be co-hosting with yours truly in the fourth
[11:10.720 --> 11:11.720]  hour today.
[11:11.720 --> 11:12.920]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[11:12.920 --> 11:16.880]  We are well into the 40 hour emergency save America.
[11:16.880 --> 11:22.200]  Stop the dictator Bill Gates special transmission and of course we just kicked off my regular
[11:22.200 --> 11:25.480]  weekday show that starts at 11 AM Central, 12 noon Eastern.
[11:25.480 --> 11:29.280]  Okay, in fact I want to play a clip of Pinkney, it's so powerful and then we're going to come
[11:29.280 --> 11:32.040]  back and hit our top story.
[11:32.040 --> 11:35.920]  After the debate was devastating for Kamala Harris, even mainstream media is having trouble
[11:35.920 --> 11:40.520]  spinning it, she's a puppet and she reads talking points and she can't respond in a
[11:40.520 --> 11:42.000]  three dimensional way.
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.960]  So Pence wiped the floor with her, but that doesn't matter, she's a puppet of the globalist.
[11:47.960 --> 11:50.360]  So you see her weakness, that doesn't matter.
[11:50.360 --> 11:52.800]  Her weakness is the globalist strength.
[11:52.800 --> 11:53.800]  That's coming up.
[11:53.800 --> 11:57.000]  But our top story is something that broke after I went off area yesterday, I went on with
[11:57.000 --> 11:58.280]  Owen Schreuer and talked about it.
[11:58.280 --> 12:03.440]  I did some more research on this and we already know what's happening, but the United Nations
[12:03.440 --> 12:08.920]  is officially having one of their operatives, he's worked for the UN or affiliated grips,
[12:08.920 --> 12:12.280]  call for the UN to militarily occupy the United States.
[12:12.280 --> 12:18.440]  That ties into the Strong Cities Initiative and so much more and they plan to do this
[12:18.440 --> 12:23.040]  during the election and this is the cover for the UN to actually come in and take control
[12:23.040 --> 12:28.280]  through the non-governmental organizations, headline, New York Times, front page, America
[12:28.280 --> 12:35.280]  may need international intervention and it goes on to say Trump must have oversight by
[12:35.280 --> 12:36.720]  the UN.
[12:36.720 --> 12:43.040]  Oversight means governance, control and they propose it here and then he proposes programs
[12:43.040 --> 12:46.800]  that have been announced for UN peacekeepers to be brought into the United States under
[12:46.800 --> 12:51.680]  7277 and that would need to be race riots that are continual and basically bring the
[12:51.680 --> 12:54.080]  country down.
[12:54.080 --> 12:57.480]  So we're going to break all this down on the other side of this quick break, we'll
[12:57.480 --> 13:02.400]  compare the term oversight in the fissures for you and we'll also look at the actual
[13:02.400 --> 13:06.960]  UN plan, you're like oh they'll never try that, that'll never happen, it's too bold.
[13:06.960 --> 13:10.320]  I'll explain why it is such a threat, how it is a real threat, how it's a very, very
[13:10.320 --> 13:12.520]  serious threat and lay it all out.
[13:12.520 --> 13:15.680]  I'm not going to bore you, I've already played it many times with Loretta Lynch when she
[13:15.680 --> 13:22.160]  was attorney general saying we'll have the UN run cities and have the UN run our borders.
[13:22.160 --> 13:28.480]  But here is Larry Pickney explaining what's really happening and we'll be right back.
[13:28.480 --> 13:35.080]  Right in front of our very eyes we are seeing the globalist deep state at work.
[13:35.080 --> 13:42.840]  Black Lives Matter and Antifa, what a terrible, terrible blight upon all people.
[13:42.840 --> 13:50.920]  Antifa, which they claim means anti-fascist, is absurd, ludicrous and totally opposite
[13:50.920 --> 13:52.720]  of what they claim to be.
[13:52.720 --> 13:57.400]  They are not anti-fascists, they are the fascists.
[13:57.400 --> 14:04.000]  Black Lives Matter, if they ruse R-U-S-E, if Black Lives Matter then why don't we do
[14:04.000 --> 14:12.000]  something about what is happening, black on black, killing black, in places like Chicago,
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.800]  Detroit, Baltimore, Washington DC, it's an endless list that won't be missed.
[14:17.800 --> 14:25.120]  So the bottom line here is that it's about divide, confusion, chaos and conquer.
[14:25.120 --> 14:32.600]  What we're watching here is insanity and particularly the deep state Democrats and their
[14:32.600 --> 14:38.360]  suspicious despicable lying media are fanning the flames.
[14:38.360 --> 14:44.720]  I urge all of my brothers and sisters, don't go for the ghost, okay, don't be duke, good
[14:44.720 --> 14:51.120]  weak, bamboozle, okay, understand that we are in this struggle as patriots, as U.S.
[14:51.120 --> 14:53.240]  citizens together.
[14:53.240 --> 15:00.760]  What we have on our side is we have each other, each other and that's extremely powerful
[15:00.760 --> 15:06.640]  and that's something that the media, the deep state Democrats and the Rhino Republicans
[15:06.640 --> 15:09.440]  for that matter, they don't want you to know that.
[15:09.440 --> 15:13.960]  They want you to think that you're alone, you're by yourself, you're not alone, you're
[15:13.960 --> 15:21.360]  not by yourself and there are a lot of people, millions, millions who are thinking just like
[15:21.360 --> 15:23.480]  you.
[15:23.480 --> 15:30.440]  This is our republic, this is all about fun and games and hurting people and destroying,
[15:30.440 --> 15:36.000]  not building, not serving the people body and soul but the exact opposite.
[15:36.000 --> 15:43.200]  So I plead with, implore with two, all my brothers and sisters of all colors, get a
[15:43.200 --> 15:50.680]  grip on reality, stop this madness, stop this insanity and those who won't stop it need
[15:50.680 --> 16:19.000]  to be stopped.
[16:19.000 --> 16:24.360]  Come is a clone of the side of the exact same links, the exact same videos, we can comment,
[16:24.360 --> 16:25.800]  we can share them everything.
[16:25.800 --> 16:32.040]  The system is censoring because of the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[16:32.040 --> 16:35.480]  Trump has finally figured this out and since he's going to take action once reelected,
[16:35.480 --> 16:38.480]  he gets big tech and then he's modern in the situation.
[16:38.480 --> 16:41.480]  Well we know the president is overwhelmed right now so we're going to sit here and cry
[16:41.480 --> 16:42.880]  because he has taken action.
[16:42.880 --> 16:47.240]  We the people are taking action now and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020
[16:47.240 --> 16:52.560]  with the nation.com, with the nation.com and checking out the new redesigned infomores.com
[16:52.560 --> 16:53.560]  and share them that way.
[16:53.560 --> 16:54.560]  Hope that really upsets them.
[16:54.560 --> 16:55.560]  Oh yeah.
[16:55.560 --> 17:02.440]  The Bible talks about there being 10 kings of the earth that sit above the nation states
[17:02.440 --> 17:08.240]  and who give their power unto the one world leader, the antichrist and he has a beast
[17:08.240 --> 17:13.240]  system that no one can buy and or sell unless he has that mark in the forehead or in the
[17:13.240 --> 17:14.240]  palm of their hand.
[17:14.240 --> 17:20.360]  So we look back on all the warnings you were given and all just the common sense that you
[17:20.360 --> 17:26.840]  don't believe in God or prophecy, giving governments and corporations the power to control who
[17:26.840 --> 17:29.240]  can buy and who can sell to track everything we do.
[17:29.240 --> 17:33.960]  It's not just a recipe, it's a blueprint for total enslavement and now you look at Bill
[17:33.960 --> 17:39.640]  Gates, you look at Bloomberg and others who openly say we're technocrats, we should decide
[17:39.640 --> 17:44.520]  how much salt you get, how much alcohol you get, how much red meat you get, we're technocrats
[17:44.520 --> 17:48.320]  we know best and we're now going to set up the economy with a social score to totally
[17:48.320 --> 17:51.920]  control you, you snap your fingers, we're here.
[17:51.920 --> 18:00.240]  They're just rolling it out and a lot of people are complying with it, it's insane.
[18:00.240 --> 18:22.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:22.960 --> 18:25.480]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[18:25.480 --> 18:29.400]  Well the time has come.
[18:29.400 --> 18:32.240]  The time is now.
[18:32.240 --> 18:39.480]  World government is out in the open, its stated aim is to carry out depopulation through poisons
[18:39.480 --> 18:44.360]  in the water, poisons in the food and poisons in the vaccines and it has already taken over
[18:44.360 --> 18:48.560]  much of the third world and has engaged in massive extermination operations that dwarf
[18:48.560 --> 18:55.760]  but Hitler, Stalin or Mao were even able to dream of but it's all here and now they're
[18:55.760 --> 18:59.720]  setting their eyes on the West as well because we will not stand up for ourselves but there
[18:59.720 --> 19:03.320]  have been many people for many decades who are aware of this and have been quietly warning
[19:03.320 --> 19:07.800]  folks and in many cases screaming from the rooftops and so there is a mounting resistance
[19:07.800 --> 19:09.360]  not just here but worldwide.
[19:09.360 --> 19:13.160]  Again I'm your host Alex Jones, I cannot stress to the viewers and listeners how precious
[19:13.160 --> 19:17.600]  you are, how incredibly important you are, if it were not for your support, if it were
[19:17.600 --> 19:23.320]  not for info wars, we would have been way behind right now and losing but we're actually
[19:23.320 --> 19:27.720]  turning the tide right now and beginning to win and the enemy's own internal documents
[19:27.720 --> 19:31.560]  that we've gotten confirm that, they believe they're losing.
[19:31.560 --> 19:37.880]  That's why they're now doing a desperate operation Barbarossa or a similar battle the
[19:37.880 --> 19:43.920]  bowls type situation where Hitler knew he was losing so did a desperate counter offensive
[19:43.920 --> 19:51.040]  that ended up hastening the end of the Third Reich and I would parallel that to World War
[19:51.040 --> 19:55.800]  II right now because the same globalist world government ideas that came out of the British
[19:55.800 --> 20:01.240]  Empire that Hitler then competed with are exactly what we're facing today.
[20:01.240 --> 20:06.720]  So let's look at this ultra massive threat and just remember that now that it's all out
[20:06.720 --> 20:11.400]  in the open the credibility of you and I and all of us that have been telling the truth
[20:11.400 --> 20:16.840]  is paramount and so we shouldn't be in an apologetic tone when oh I know you're busy
[20:16.840 --> 20:21.320]  or I know this sounds crazy but let me tell you about this, you should be very authoritative
[20:21.320 --> 20:27.840]  and a leader who is there warning people about the sinking ship to get to the lifeboats that
[20:27.840 --> 20:32.320]  it's all about your authoritativeness and they will listen.
[20:32.320 --> 20:35.960]  Gone are the times the media laughing at folks that warned of world government and forced
[20:35.960 --> 20:38.640]  imoculations.
[20:38.640 --> 20:46.040]  So we've talked about the axis of power a big event has taken place as of yesterday afternoon.
[20:46.040 --> 20:51.880]  The axis of power is the global megabanks all the big robber baron money with client
[20:51.880 --> 20:58.360]  states like communist China leveraging once free nations to deindustrialize us allied
[20:58.360 --> 21:04.000]  with the EU bureaucracy, allied with the left, allied with Hollywood, allied with radical
[21:04.000 --> 21:11.640]  Islam in their desire to bring down Christendom or the western Christian ethos and common
[21:11.640 --> 21:16.320]  law because even from a non spiritual position their authoritarian world government cannot
[21:16.320 --> 21:18.840]  compete with open free society.
[21:18.840 --> 21:25.000]  We must fall so the whole world can fall further into the grip of the technocrats and the exterminist
[21:25.000 --> 21:28.680]  operation they wish to carry out.
[21:28.680 --> 21:32.320]  And so we laid out methodically how communist China because I would go look at who funded
[21:32.320 --> 21:36.640]  all these TV shows and movies about race riots and evil white people and uprising kill the
[21:36.640 --> 21:40.960]  white people and the UN is going to save you and communist China will save the world and
[21:40.960 --> 21:44.160]  the Washington Post headline we must crush Trump G.G.
[21:44.160 --> 21:46.480]  Ping must destroy Trump to save America.
[21:46.480 --> 21:49.920]  You've all seen it spray paint all over Austin, you know, up with G.G.
[21:49.920 --> 21:53.000]  Ping in China down with America.
[21:53.000 --> 21:58.280]  This is the real cult left one of my main producers of many years who works here today
[21:58.280 --> 22:04.880]  but he's been here 15, 16 years, 6, 17 years, excuse me, his sister is an avowed minion
[22:04.880 --> 22:05.880]  of G.G.
[22:05.880 --> 22:10.880]  Ping and and praises him and says down with America and she's to be completely
[22:10.880 --> 22:12.720]  normal and as well educated.
[22:12.720 --> 22:15.760]  So this is a real power faction.
[22:15.760 --> 22:17.960]  They're following a malice operation.
[22:17.960 --> 22:22.040]  So let's go through the huge news.
[22:22.040 --> 22:29.000]  At the blue city level and at the state level or Democrats are in control.
[22:29.000 --> 22:35.640]  They have an agreement called UN Munialization and they have over 20 things that cities will
[22:35.640 --> 22:37.800]  partner with the UN on.
[22:37.800 --> 22:40.680]  Most cities only partner on one or two things.
[22:40.680 --> 22:44.840]  And some like Austin partner on almost all of the issues.
[22:44.840 --> 22:47.320]  New York partners on all of them.
[22:47.320 --> 22:48.320]  Now here's what they say.
[22:48.320 --> 22:49.920]  This is the Daily Mail today.
[22:49.920 --> 22:55.560]  Chinese state newspaper claims the U.S. is a failed state ruled by a racist president
[22:55.560 --> 23:01.160]  and as it rips into Donald Trump and says the United States should be dissolved.
[23:01.160 --> 23:05.800]  Now here's from five years ago, Obama administration and UN announced global police force to fight
[23:05.800 --> 23:10.920]  extremism in U.S. saying whites are the main problem must be dealt with.
[23:10.920 --> 23:12.520]  That's the current FBI statement as well.
[23:12.520 --> 23:16.760]  If you think Trump has control of the FBI, I think again, at the top of it, Marxist-Leninist
[23:16.760 --> 23:20.960]  malice 100% and they say the number one enemy is white people.
[23:20.960 --> 23:25.880]  So the ethos is whites are bad, the UN must come in and oversee a race war that defeats
[23:25.880 --> 23:26.880]  the white people.
[23:26.880 --> 23:28.600]  Can't make that up.
[23:28.600 --> 23:29.760]  And you can go listen.
[23:29.760 --> 23:36.320]  Mike Barton for hours of her at the UN saying this, I've played it probably 20 times on
[23:36.320 --> 23:37.320]  here.
[23:37.320 --> 23:42.200]  Obama administration and UN announced global police force to fight extremism in the United
[23:42.200 --> 23:48.720]  States and then it just continues on from there and here's a list of just some of the
[23:48.720 --> 23:53.960]  cities and the strong cities initiative where the UN actually runs your police department
[23:53.960 --> 23:59.600]  oversight board, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch announces the launch of the Strong Cities
[23:59.600 --> 24:03.000]  Network in the United Nations General Assembly.
[24:03.000 --> 24:04.960]  You can go watch the videos right there.
[24:04.960 --> 24:08.520]  Now let's move to our main exhibit now, just give you a little bit of background, what's
[24:08.520 --> 24:12.720]  currently happening with China saying we shouldn't exist because we're mean to black people when
[24:12.720 --> 24:16.120]  they're the most racist towards blacks in the world, I think it's Chinese folks on average.
[24:16.120 --> 24:17.120]  It's incredible.
[24:17.120 --> 24:19.880]  Let's just go ahead and go to this.
[24:19.880 --> 24:27.600]  America may need international intervention, give me the Thessaurus synonym for intervention
[24:27.600 --> 24:35.520]  means invasion, action, overtaking, domination, I mean, but let's look at this next word.
[24:35.520 --> 24:40.320]  Even Democrats may find it hard to imagine, but the leader of the free world, that's in
[24:40.320 --> 24:47.280]  quotes because we're not really a good country, would benefit from United Nations oversight.
[24:47.280 --> 24:52.400]  Now Peter Benart is not from the United States, he's a big UN global government pusher, you
[24:52.400 --> 24:59.480]  can go read his full bio, fawning about him at Wikipedia, but when you read what the word
[24:59.480 --> 25:06.360]  UN oversight means, let's look at the online Thessaurus, control, handling, inspection,
[25:06.360 --> 25:13.480]  maintenance, management, surveillance, administration, charge, custody, direction, keeping, guardianship.
[25:13.480 --> 25:24.000]  You see there, guardianship, like you're a 90-year-old and your son or daughter has guardianship.
[25:24.000 --> 25:30.600]  So we need UN oversight governance above us, governance.
[25:30.600 --> 25:37.040]  So we need UN governance, the UN always say we need global governance and I go, oh, that's
[25:37.040 --> 25:41.680]  government, no, no, governance doesn't mean government, this it does, they play these
[25:41.680 --> 25:46.960]  games, so that's the plan.
[25:46.960 --> 25:54.840]  They plan to have giant race war, they already flipped the fuse on during the contested election,
[25:54.840 --> 25:59.840]  that's their plan and the UN has all these blue cities that are ready to say they're
[25:59.840 --> 26:08.480]  going to secede during the contested election and that they will announce that they're having
[26:08.480 --> 26:12.640]  their own inauguration, even if Trump still has his and the UN will then come in on the
[26:12.640 --> 26:17.880]  side of the secession movement here in the United States.
[26:17.880 --> 26:21.160]  Now that's what they do all over the world, they go in and break open countries and take
[26:21.160 --> 26:25.800]  control of them, so I know this seems amazing, they're doing it, they've announced it, will
[26:25.800 --> 26:26.800]  they succeed?
[26:26.800 --> 26:30.720]  I don't know, they're certainly trying and I've been saying for months and months the
[26:30.720 --> 26:35.040]  last straw will be when they announce the New York Times or Atlantic Monthly, that's
[26:35.040 --> 26:38.320]  where they always do their announcements, then it'll be parroted everywhere, which it is,
[26:38.320 --> 26:43.440]  that the UN must come in as the outside arbiter between the Republicans and the Democrats
[26:43.440 --> 26:48.280]  for oversight or governance over our elections, which the UN does in terrible countries.
[26:48.280 --> 26:52.840]  So there you go, they're trying to swallow the Republican strikers trying to swallow
[26:52.840 --> 26:56.280]  the Republic all in one gulp, the American Eagle.
[26:56.280 --> 27:02.280]  The globalists are very, very honest about their planetary goals, they want private corporate
[27:02.280 --> 27:09.880]  governance above nation-states, above religious institutions, above the family, they want
[27:09.880 --> 27:11.680]  total corporate power.
[27:11.680 --> 27:17.440]  There was a great film back in the early 1970s called Roller Ball with James Cahn, and it's
[27:17.440 --> 27:24.520]  based on a novel set in the year 2020, and in the book you have megacorporates that control
[27:24.520 --> 27:31.240]  the planet and there are no longer nation-states, there are only cities that are the capitals
[27:31.240 --> 27:32.240]  of the corporations.
[27:32.240 --> 27:36.560]  But when you actually read what the Davos group and the CFR and Dr. Lionel commission
[27:36.560 --> 27:41.680]  say in the year 2020, that is their in-game, that is their goal.
[27:41.680 --> 27:46.720]  So we're talking about a Hunger Games type scenario here run by very, very, very ruthless
[27:46.720 --> 27:52.120]  people to see us as chattel, and they're using COVID-19 as their takeover strategy and Communist
[27:52.120 --> 27:55.920]  China as their model, we must reject it now.
[27:55.920 --> 28:01.360]  For more than a hundred years, the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to establish world government,
[28:01.360 --> 28:06.520]  abolish nation-states, dumb down the population by taking control of education, and most importantly
[28:06.520 --> 28:09.440]  taking control of western medicine.
[28:09.440 --> 28:14.400]  Now they had a bad name by the 1920s, they started converting over and funding other
[28:14.400 --> 28:20.800]  organizations and groups like IBM to continue on with their eugenics operations.
[28:20.800 --> 28:26.760]  From the 1940s to the 1980s, the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on the board of directors
[28:26.760 --> 28:30.800]  to Bill Gates III, his father of course being head of Planned Parenthood.
[28:30.800 --> 28:35.800]  And now he's been able to position himself over almost every health department in the
[28:35.800 --> 28:38.800]  world, every national health system.
[28:38.800 --> 28:44.520]  Bill Gates is in control, they have spent a hundred plus years getting positioned to
[28:44.520 --> 28:48.800]  be able to control what happens to your body and what goes in your body.
[28:48.800 --> 28:53.520]  This is the holy grail of their operations, and now they're normalizing, putting a new
[28:53.520 --> 28:55.840]  type of DNA in your body.
[28:55.840 --> 29:02.360]  The future isn't coming, it's here, and in the future, keeping your humanity, saving
[29:02.360 --> 29:07.600]  your soul, your integrity, your very essence, is going to be your most valuable asset.
[29:07.600 --> 29:11.160]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[29:11.160 --> 29:16.800]  The world being built by the technocrats, and the trap they've now sprung with COVID-19
[29:16.800 --> 29:22.800]  and the endless lockdown, is the beginning of the process of taking us past investigation
[29:22.800 --> 29:27.800]  into total and complete dehumanization.
[29:27.800 --> 29:33.800]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year
[29:33.800 --> 29:34.800]  2050.
[29:34.800 --> 29:36.800]  This is their stated goal.
[29:36.800 --> 29:42.800]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror
[29:42.800 --> 29:46.800]  and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy can we turn this around.
[29:46.800 --> 29:51.800]  You must study their own writings, you must face the facts, and you must come to grips
[29:51.800 --> 29:52.800]  with it.
[29:52.800 --> 30:21.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:53.800 --> 30:55.800]  We are back, my friends.
[30:55.800 --> 30:57.800]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[30:57.800 --> 31:03.800]  On this October 8th, Thursday, a little broadcast with 25 days out from the election.
[31:03.800 --> 31:05.800]  Let me tell you about who's coming up today.
[31:05.800 --> 31:09.800]  I'm going to hit really the big news that's coming up, and the rest of the news we're going
[31:09.800 --> 31:10.800]  to be breaking down.
[31:10.800 --> 31:17.800]  We have Laura Loomer valiantly running for Congress in Donald Trump's district in Florida.
[31:17.800 --> 31:21.800]  She's got a lot to cover, a lot to break down on the election on the debate last night.
[31:21.800 --> 31:24.800]  Always popular, always love having them on.
[31:24.800 --> 31:32.800]  The Hodge twins, Larry Pinkney, who in person is the best speaker I've ever heard.
[31:32.800 --> 31:36.800]  And some of the speeches he gives are the best I've ever heard, but you don't have dinner
[31:36.800 --> 31:37.800]  with the guy.
[31:37.800 --> 31:40.800]  That's when he really, really turns loose.
[31:40.800 --> 31:43.800]  But you heard me earlier in the hour play three minutes of him.
[31:43.800 --> 31:47.800]  That's about his best oratory truth is you're ever going to hear.
[31:47.800 --> 31:52.800]  I'm going to see if I can get him to really turn loose on air because he's usually pretty
[31:52.800 --> 31:56.800]  deferential when he's given a speech and doesn't really turn on the high voltage.
[31:56.800 --> 32:00.800]  But I'm going to ask him to give a direct message to the New World Order and a lot more because
[32:00.800 --> 32:02.800]  he's about the best speaker I've ever heard.
[32:02.800 --> 32:03.800]  So that's coming up.
[32:03.800 --> 32:05.800]  That's why they threw his ass in prison.
[32:05.800 --> 32:07.800]  He's a real political dissident.
[32:07.800 --> 32:10.800]  So he's coming up and will continue with the 40 hour broadcast.
[32:10.800 --> 32:11.800]  I'm not going to complain.
[32:11.800 --> 32:14.800]  I want to thank the listeners for all your support and all you've done.
[32:14.800 --> 32:18.800]  But I just want to explain something here and be very, very crystal clear about this.
[32:18.800 --> 32:23.800]  There isn't an outlet or a place period that is as accurate and effective.
[32:23.800 --> 32:25.800]  And I don't say that with pleasure.
[32:25.800 --> 32:29.800]  I get calls by the top talk show host in the country.
[32:29.800 --> 32:34.800]  You name it, the top ones, they all come, I guess, pay their respects or whatever.
[32:34.800 --> 32:36.800]  And I respect them as well.
[32:36.800 --> 32:37.800]  It's not bragging.
[32:37.800 --> 32:40.800]  And they go, man, we wish we could go as far as you go.
[32:40.800 --> 32:41.800]  We used to think you were nuts.
[32:41.800 --> 32:43.800]  Everything you're saying is coming true.
[32:43.800 --> 32:46.800]  And I say, well, can you go further?
[32:46.800 --> 32:49.800]  And they say, we're trying, but you can name the names.
[32:49.800 --> 32:51.800]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[32:51.800 --> 32:53.800]  I got one of the calls yesterday.
[32:53.800 --> 32:56.800]  Got another call the other day before that.
[32:56.800 --> 32:58.800]  And one of these guys was in town last week.
[32:58.800 --> 33:01.800]  You wanted to hang out and I said, I'm sorry, I got to work.
[33:01.800 --> 33:03.800]  And I thought about being all Mr. Cool.
[33:03.800 --> 33:06.800]  I just want the audience to understand.
[33:06.800 --> 33:10.800]  They don't have platforms that will let them go as far as they can.
[33:10.800 --> 33:14.800]  It's up to us to get the truth out to make it safe for others to do it.
[33:14.800 --> 33:18.800]  And everyone recognizes that we, and that means you that have supported the show,
[33:18.800 --> 33:22.800]  you that spread word of mouth, you that prayed for us, you that financially supported us.
[33:22.800 --> 33:24.800]  You're just as important as I am.
[33:24.800 --> 33:27.800]  Do you understand that?
[33:27.800 --> 33:29.800]  Damn it.
[33:29.800 --> 33:32.800]  That's why when you call up thanking me, it's asinine.
[33:32.800 --> 33:34.800]  All I want to do is fight the new world order.
[33:34.800 --> 33:37.800]  I'm like a boxer in a boxing match that wants to keep fighting.
[33:37.800 --> 33:42.800]  I can take the headshots, the rib shots, the shots, the gut, but I don't have oxygen.
[33:42.800 --> 33:44.800]  You're the oxygen.
[33:44.800 --> 33:49.800]  And when you support me, all of a sudden I'm like 16 again.
[33:49.800 --> 33:54.800]  But the oxygen has dollar signs on it and it has your word of mouth on it, your prayer.
[33:54.800 --> 33:57.800]  Those three commodities that are all very important.
[33:57.800 --> 33:58.800]  Prayer being paramount.
[33:58.800 --> 34:02.800]  And seriously, if all you can do is pray for the show, I want that first and foremost.
[34:02.800 --> 34:03.800]  And I appreciate you.
[34:03.800 --> 34:04.800]  Just keep me in the fight.
[34:04.800 --> 34:10.800]  But listen, we raised $225,000 and most of that's product sales.
[34:10.800 --> 34:14.800]  So we really only raised about $150,000 and I'm not complaining.
[34:14.800 --> 34:22.800]  But when we have shortfalls looking into next year of a million dollars and I'm not complaining.
[34:22.800 --> 34:23.800]  It's all God's will.
[34:23.800 --> 34:26.800]  If you want to see these crew members, stay where they are.
[34:26.800 --> 34:28.800]  You want to see our broadcast stay where they are.
[34:28.800 --> 34:30.800]  And you want to see us with our crew on the ground around the world.
[34:30.800 --> 34:32.800]  And you want to see us cover Bilderberg and Davos.
[34:32.800 --> 34:36.800]  You want to see all of this continue on.
[34:36.800 --> 34:42.800]  And a lot of stuff behind the scenes that I financed and funded with no strings attached that I've had to stop.
[34:42.800 --> 34:50.800]  I've had the last year to like pull most of my funding to more than 20 different groups and organizations just because we don't have the capital to do it.
[34:50.800 --> 34:53.800]  And so we got to keep this core operation going.
[34:53.800 --> 35:00.800]  We've got great products that you need and who else is going to expose the UN takeover the way it's actually happening.
[35:00.800 --> 35:03.800]  Every other person's like the UN will march in with troops.
[35:03.800 --> 35:04.800]  No, they won't.
[35:04.800 --> 35:07.800]  They take your city and your police over and it's done.
[35:07.800 --> 35:10.800]  And they go, yeah, we take orders from the UN just like big tech does.
[35:10.800 --> 35:11.800]  That's it.
[35:11.800 --> 35:19.800]  We're already 90% at the local level in big cities under UN control.
[35:19.800 --> 35:20.800]  90%.
[35:20.800 --> 35:27.800]  I mean, hell, City of Austin, City of New York takes orders from the United Nations and they even say they do.
[35:27.800 --> 35:31.800]  Detroit does, LA does, San Francisco does.
[35:31.800 --> 35:35.800]  And it's so horrible.
[35:35.800 --> 35:39.800]  But again, they're going to roll out their agenda of Agenda 21, Agenda 2030.
[35:39.800 --> 35:40.800]  It's going to get hellish.
[35:40.800 --> 35:50.800]  And they know there will be a resistance politically, culturally, economically, physically of need be that will defeat them because what they're doing is outrageous and horrible and unpopular.
[35:50.800 --> 35:53.800]  It has to operate by stealth and deception and incrementalism.
[35:53.800 --> 36:03.800]  But if we're not on air, when nobody else has got their own platform, everybody else is scared, folks.
[36:03.800 --> 36:05.800]  Len Beck was telling the truth.
[36:05.800 --> 36:11.800]  They came after him internally with a bunch of stuff, almost shut him down.
[36:11.800 --> 36:13.800]  They went after everybody else, folks.
[36:13.800 --> 36:20.800]  They were able to shut everyone else up but us.
[36:20.800 --> 36:23.800]  Yeah, we thought it does a great job.
[36:23.800 --> 36:25.800]  But it's articles, some videos.
[36:25.800 --> 36:26.800]  It's great.
[36:26.800 --> 36:29.800]  I'm glad to see them coming along.
[36:29.800 --> 36:33.800]  But we have a responsibility here and I'm so thankful to our local stations.
[36:33.800 --> 36:36.800]  I'm so thankful to our local TV stations and I ask listeners and viewers to support them.
[36:36.800 --> 36:40.800]  I'm very thankful to the folks over at Cloud TV where we are number one.
[36:40.800 --> 36:44.800]  We have more viewers than all their news channels combined.
[36:44.800 --> 36:46.800]  And everybody got jealous of that.
[36:46.800 --> 36:48.800]  So they took us from the top to down to the bottom.
[36:48.800 --> 36:53.800]  So when you're number one, they got to put you back at the back of the race because you can go to the front again.
[36:53.800 --> 36:55.800]  And I'm not mad about that.
[36:55.800 --> 37:03.800]  But it's just in the real world, folks, when you're a visionary and a trailblazer like you are and like I am, they have to hold you back.
[37:03.800 --> 37:04.800]  You don't get the checkered flag.
[37:04.800 --> 37:05.800]  You don't get the champagne.
[37:05.800 --> 37:06.800]  Well, guess what?
[37:06.800 --> 37:08.800]  I didn't come here for a checkered flag or champagne.
[37:08.800 --> 37:14.800]  I want victory for my children and your children and I'm willing to die for this fight.
[37:14.800 --> 37:18.800]  In fact, if the New World Order could put a gun in my head and pull the trigger, but it defeated them, I'd say pull that trigger.
[37:18.800 --> 37:19.800]  I'd pull it for them.
[37:19.800 --> 37:24.800]  But no, we're going to have to fight for every inch of ground.
[37:24.800 --> 37:25.800]  We're going to have to scrounge for the money.
[37:25.800 --> 37:28.800]  We're going to have to scrounge for every facet.
[37:28.800 --> 37:33.800]  We're going to be discriminated against with our bank accounts and our sponsors and everything we do because we're good people.
[37:33.800 --> 37:34.800]  You're good.
[37:34.800 --> 37:40.800]  And we're not scared of this fight against these devil worshiping Satanists that are so exposed because that's the good news.
[37:40.800 --> 37:43.800]  The New World Order is so exposed right now.
[37:43.800 --> 37:45.800]  Their projects are in trouble.
[37:45.800 --> 37:47.800]  Their operations are in trouble.
[37:47.800 --> 37:49.800]  And they are so close to going down.
[37:49.800 --> 37:57.800]  They implemented this martial law, forced inoculation, world government lockdown plan that they're behind schedule on early.
[37:57.800 --> 37:59.800]  And they're behind schedule.
[37:59.800 --> 38:01.800]  So they're not ready to launch this for another 5, 10 years.
[38:01.800 --> 38:04.800]  They launched it early because they're in so much trouble.
[38:04.800 --> 38:06.800]  This is desperation.
[38:06.800 --> 38:08.800]  They're on the ropes, not us.
[38:08.800 --> 38:14.800]  So we've got to decide to throw our punches full power politically and know we're going to break their jaw.
[38:14.800 --> 38:17.800]  We're going to break their ribs politically.
[38:17.800 --> 38:21.800]  And you know when you decide to really hit somebody, hit them politically.
[38:21.800 --> 38:24.800]  I'm talking about turning your will loose on their ass.

[41:55.800 --> 41:58.800]  Hello, my name is Dr. Fauci.
[41:58.800 --> 42:02.800]  And I've been at the NIH and CDC for 45 years.
[42:02.800 --> 42:04.800]  And I've overseen well.
[42:04.800 --> 42:08.800]  You know, the AIDS pandemic and so many other things.
[42:08.800 --> 42:12.800]  And I take my orders from Bill Gates, Dr. Bill Gates.
[42:12.800 --> 42:17.800]  I mean, he's not a doctor, but he controls everything you do.
[42:17.800 --> 42:21.800]  And he now says you're going to take the shots.
[42:21.800 --> 42:25.800]  And of course, in England, they are now saying what I told you.
[42:25.800 --> 42:27.800]  You will not be allowed to travel.
[42:27.800 --> 42:30.800]  Leave your home until you take all the shots.
[42:30.800 --> 42:36.800]  Dr. Gates, I mean Bill Gates, your owner, your master,
[42:36.800 --> 42:40.800]  says you will have to take four to five COVID shots a year
[42:40.800 --> 42:46.800]  for adult, two for baby, baby, much more manageable.
[42:46.800 --> 42:49.800]  Just like Bill Gates give you polio and vaccine.
[42:49.800 --> 43:01.800]  I am Dr. Fauci reminding you that we owe you.
[43:20.800 --> 43:23.800]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[43:23.800 --> 43:52.800]  Thank you so much.
[43:53.800 --> 43:57.800]  Oh, yeah.
[43:57.800 --> 44:17.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:17.800 --> 44:20.800]  Well, we knew it was coming.
[44:20.800 --> 44:23.800]  I predicted over and over again the last few months,
[44:23.800 --> 44:26.800]  it's not a hard prediction that they engage in a provocateur setup
[44:26.800 --> 44:30.800]  or a false flag against Democrat Party officials
[44:30.800 --> 44:34.800]  to make them look like victims when they launch incredible tyranny.
[44:34.800 --> 44:36.800]  Deep Stater, Governor Whitmer,
[44:36.800 --> 44:41.800]  who sent all those patients with COVID into nursing homes
[44:41.800 --> 44:43.800]  so she'd get a higher death rate.
[44:43.800 --> 44:47.800]  That monster, the woman that has that crazy look and psycho smile,
[44:47.800 --> 44:52.800]  she supposedly was the victim or the potential victim
[44:52.800 --> 44:55.800]  of a plot to kidnap her.
[44:55.800 --> 44:57.800]  Oh, that's right.
[44:57.800 --> 45:01.800]  Six people charged with a plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Whitmer.
[45:01.800 --> 45:03.800]  The FBI quoted one of the accusers saying,
[45:03.800 --> 45:05.800]  Whitmer has no checks and balances at all.
[45:05.800 --> 45:07.800]  She has uncontrolled power right now.
[45:07.800 --> 45:10.800]  All things must come to an end.
[45:10.800 --> 45:13.800]  Funny, the Supreme Court of the state just ruled
[45:13.800 --> 45:17.800]  that she'd taken all powers legislative executive judicial under herself
[45:17.800 --> 45:19.800]  and had become a dictator,
[45:19.800 --> 45:21.800]  that the state was under a form of martial law.
[45:21.800 --> 45:25.800]  That was the ruling on Monday.
[45:25.800 --> 45:27.800]  And it's gotten almost no attention,
[45:27.800 --> 45:31.800]  but now the same FBI leadership still run by the Deep State
[45:31.800 --> 45:33.800]  that says the number one threat is white supremacy.
[45:33.800 --> 45:36.800]  The same FBI has been caught creating militia groups,
[45:36.800 --> 45:38.800]  winding them up, setting them up.
[45:38.800 --> 45:40.800]  The judges ruled the Hattari militia.
[45:40.800 --> 45:42.800]  It was not planning a takeover.
[45:42.800 --> 45:44.800]  It was all a setup.
[45:44.800 --> 45:46.800]  The FBI informant said, well, what if the UN invades
[45:46.800 --> 45:48.800]  and is arresting everyone and putting us in camps?
[45:48.800 --> 45:53.800]  Well, we'll have to fight then and take the local government back.
[45:53.800 --> 45:55.800]  What if, remember the Hattari militia?
[45:55.800 --> 45:57.800]  The recordings were released.
[45:57.800 --> 46:00.800]  They're driving to the Knob Creek machine gun shootout.
[46:00.800 --> 46:02.800]  And they're asking them, the FBI informant,
[46:02.800 --> 46:04.800]  well, what do we do if the UN takes over
[46:04.800 --> 46:06.800]  and put everybody in prison camps?
[46:06.800 --> 46:08.800]  Well, we'll have to fight and take back
[46:08.800 --> 46:10.800]  the local government for America.
[46:10.800 --> 46:14.800]  We'll have to move indicted because there's a UN takeover happening.
[46:14.800 --> 46:16.800]  Front page, the New York Times.
[46:16.800 --> 46:19.800]  The UN needs to occupy America.
[46:19.800 --> 46:22.800]  And so the number one sin is talking about,
[46:22.800 --> 46:23.800]  you're not going to put up with it.
[46:23.800 --> 46:25.800]  And again, militias are in the Constitution.
[46:25.800 --> 46:28.800]  I think they're good, especially in Michigan and other areas.
[46:28.800 --> 46:30.800]  They're always getting infiltrated by the feds
[46:30.800 --> 46:34.800]  that tend to lead them to set people up.
[46:34.800 --> 46:37.800]  What are you going to do when they come to take the guns?
[46:37.800 --> 46:40.800]  What are you going to do when Antony was killing people door to door?
[46:40.800 --> 46:41.800]  Well, I guess nothing.
[46:41.800 --> 46:43.800]  Well, I guess you're not a man.
[46:43.800 --> 46:46.800]  Or somebody says something like, I need some more ammo.
[46:46.800 --> 46:48.800]  Oh, you're planning to kill some people.
[46:48.800 --> 46:49.800]  No, I just need some more ammo.
[46:49.800 --> 46:50.800]  Everything breaking down.
[46:50.800 --> 46:52.800]  Oh, you're scared.
[46:52.800 --> 46:55.800]  You're scared to stand up?
[46:55.800 --> 46:58.800]  Well, no, I'm willing to kidnap the governor.
[46:58.800 --> 47:00.800]  And then they got you.
[47:00.800 --> 47:02.800]  They could be the headline and, oh my gosh, see, the FBI's right.
[47:02.800 --> 47:04.800]  It's white supremacist.
[47:04.800 --> 47:06.800]  Kyle Rittenhouse is a white supremacist, even though he's not.
[47:06.800 --> 47:08.800]  They're gonna send the man to jail.
[47:08.800 --> 47:10.800]  They only have to respect these guys.
[47:10.800 --> 47:12.800]  It goes on and on.
[47:12.800 --> 47:14.800]  There's echoes of Ruby Ridge, another setup where they told him,
[47:14.800 --> 47:17.800]  you're gonna sell guns for us illegally.
[47:17.800 --> 47:19.800]  And you're gonna set up these local groups.
[47:19.800 --> 47:21.800]  We're going to put you in prison.
[47:21.800 --> 47:23.800]  You saw that in it.
[47:23.800 --> 47:30.800]  So they're trying the exact same playbook yet again.
[47:30.800 --> 47:32.800]  We've got the criminal complaint.
[47:32.800 --> 47:33.800]  Here.
[47:33.800 --> 47:35.800]  Oh, that's pretty bad.
[47:35.800 --> 47:42.560]  to kidnap Governor Whitmer and what other false flags are we going to see now
[47:42.560 --> 47:48.040]  because this is definitely a probably a provocateur action but he what do you do
[47:48.040 --> 47:50.160]  what if the governor said you can never leave your house again you gotta start
[47:50.160 --> 47:53.960]  to death lay down and die I guess because the power to shut things down is
[47:53.960 --> 47:56.560]  the power to bankrupt it's the power to kill what about all the folks committed
[47:56.560 --> 48:00.080]  suicide because our all the folks that again died because she's hit COVID
[48:00.080 --> 48:07.280]  patients there well she's the governor she's above the law she's God it's all
[48:07.280 --> 48:11.840]  just a bunch of lawyers in the FBI who just want to go have news events and
[48:11.840 --> 48:17.800]  stunts of course this announcement to overshadow did we ever follow did we
[48:17.800 --> 48:22.960]  ever cover the 11 a.m. national security press conference on all the spine oh no
[48:22.960 --> 48:28.320]  sorry we didn't care about that we didn't care about the attempt to overthrow
[48:28.320 --> 48:33.400]  the election of the president and so now here we are over the top bombshell
[48:33.400 --> 48:42.000]  New York Times calls for you in to occupy the United States of America you
[48:42.000 --> 48:46.360]  know why they're so upset it's because Trump is trying to get our troops out
[48:46.360 --> 48:52.240]  of all these illegal wars he's trying to do his job and so communist China comes
[48:52.240 --> 48:57.360]  out and says oh it's the United States it's a racist country it's a failed state
[48:57.360 --> 49:01.680]  that that's a quote doesn't even deserve to exist we need the UN to go in to the
[49:01.680 --> 49:05.840]  failed state and then we have Obama five years ago setting up the strong
[49:05.840 --> 49:09.320]  citizen nation with a UN with it over the blue cities there's all the articles
[49:09.320 --> 49:17.200]  on that you've got XCA insider says China spy recruitment targeting New York
[49:17.200 --> 49:21.040]  City of course they've been caught with the police and military officers of
[49:21.040 --> 49:27.160]  everybody else spying on Americans and spying on other people spying on Chinese
[49:27.160 --> 49:30.640]  and Tibet is trying to get out who's coming to the United States they can
[49:30.640 --> 49:37.160]  punish their families New York PD officer charged spying for China but you
[49:37.160 --> 49:44.120]  know FBI says it's not China is the threat it's the white people America may
[49:44.120 --> 49:48.280]  need international intervention even Democrats may find it hard to imagine
[49:48.280 --> 49:52.280]  but the leader of the free world would benefit from the United Nations oversight
[49:52.280 --> 50:01.960]  and again what does oversight mean in the the Tsarists as a
[50:02.600 --> 50:13.600]  synonym controlled handling inspection maintenance administration that means
[50:13.600 --> 50:21.560]  governance surveillance management custody direction guard guardianship
[50:21.560 --> 50:27.560]  here let's click on administration what does that mean it's governance global
[50:27.560 --> 50:32.760]  governance and why are they mad Trump US troops in Afghanistan should be home by
[50:32.760 --> 50:40.760]  Christmas well we can't have that oh China North Korea Cuba Iran denounce us
[50:40.760 --> 50:48.920]  for systemic racial discrimination at UN we're a poor example we're bad people
[50:48.920 --> 50:52.680]  our country is a failed state in the UN needs to come in and then the New York
[50:52.680 --> 50:56.920]  Times the day after communist China officially says that at the UN says
[50:56.920 --> 51:03.280]  yeah we need the UN here go read the article oh but the Hattari militia set
[51:03.280 --> 51:07.280]  up had like 10 members they were a shooting club two of the members were
[51:07.280 --> 51:13.680]  FBI informants told how to go in took them years to finally in a truck driving
[51:13.680 --> 51:17.040]  to a gun shoot the little the UN takes over and there's a rest in everybody and
[51:17.040 --> 51:21.000]  put this in camps what do we do I guess we'll have to find them boom you're
[51:21.000 --> 51:28.200]  arrested you don't fight the UN you don't talk bad about it you go to jail
[51:30.200 --> 51:37.840]  and now we've got governor Whitmer put up the ruling guys you can pull it up
[51:37.840 --> 51:41.800]  just type in Supreme Court rules Whitmer COVID restrictions and
[51:41.800 --> 51:45.600]  constitutional and I read part of it on air and it says this is most reconditioning
[51:45.600 --> 51:51.000]  thing in state history patently against the Constitution and rule of law she's
[51:51.000 --> 51:55.960]  transferred all power to herself legislative executive and judicial and
[51:55.960 --> 52:01.800]  is now operating in form of martial law but here comes the federal Bureau of
[52:01.800 --> 52:08.320]  Investigation with the cavalry call over the hill with some militia guys they
[52:08.320 --> 52:14.960]  got in a restaurant but sitting back yeah she's gone too far we ought to grab
[52:14.960 --> 52:18.960]  her and number one you don't want to turn an evil person into a victim the
[52:18.960 --> 52:22.520]  last thing you'd ever want to do would be kidnap a governor that was doing
[52:22.520 --> 52:26.400]  something wrong you want to expose her you want to sue her you want to do like
[52:26.400 --> 52:29.520]  the guy when her husband said take our boat out the guy said nobody else's
[52:29.520 --> 52:33.520]  boat's loud he was she's the governor he said get your boat off my boat property
[52:33.520 --> 52:37.640]  now you can keep your 200 bucks a month or whatever for your rental get your
[52:37.640 --> 52:42.440]  boat off and then he went to the news that's when the governor comes to your
[52:42.440 --> 52:46.800]  restaurant you say you get your fat ugly evil ass out of here when her kids
[52:46.800 --> 52:52.640]  come around you say your mom's a witch get away from us you shun her you you
[52:52.640 --> 52:57.280]  denounce her you run against her you don't meet in a restaurant to talk about
[52:57.280 --> 53:01.920]  how you're gonna overthrow the governor
[53:01.920 --> 53:12.160]  now they've turned the witch I mean look at that fake psycho smile of just
[53:12.160 --> 53:17.520]  narcissistic demon possession on her face only one person looks close to that
[53:17.520 --> 53:21.600]  that evil as a governor and that's Newsom I mean Newsom has that same demon
[53:21.600 --> 53:24.800]  face look that you know you're in trouble when you look at that that just
[53:24.800 --> 53:32.000]  move that's and then Stelter I mean folks that's what a devil worshipper looks
[53:32.000 --> 53:38.000]  like Brian Stelter governor Whitmer governor Newsom when you see that
[53:38.000 --> 53:42.280]  jack-o-lantern smile on Hillary Scott you see that all the time like their
[53:42.280 --> 53:48.920]  face over there's like I can't even do it it's so evil to that always smiling
[53:48.920 --> 53:53.360]  always in charge always gonna get you gonna get you get you get you get you
[53:53.360 --> 53:59.640]  get you get you same little Bill Gates smile he does we're gonna go to break I'm
[53:59.640 --> 54:02.280]  gonna get to some of the huge announcements trumps made about China some
[54:02.280 --> 54:07.760]  of the debate highlights Laura Loomer's joining us Larry Pinkney the Hodge Twins
[54:07.760 --> 54:13.560]  and so much more but you can bet your bottom dollar that this is a false flag
[54:13.560 --> 54:22.440]  setup bare minimum provocateur operation by the Federal Bureau of China and all
[54:22.440 --> 54:27.000]  the things they do so just know they're they're in the season of setting up
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.080]  folks the election ahead of I'm sure they'll have another one of their boys
[54:30.080 --> 54:34.360]  roll in a pneumonia nitrate truck into a building like they did in 95 with the
[54:34.360 --> 54:38.160]  ATF and German intelligence I know the names are by the dead it I'm gonna be
[54:38.160 --> 54:44.240]  the cops and survive and the feds told us he killed your friends
[54:44.240 --> 54:49.800]  the Bible talks about there being 10 kings of the earth that sit above the
[54:49.800 --> 54:54.280]  nation states and who give their power unto the one-world leader the antichrist
[54:54.280 --> 54:59.560]  and he has a beast system that no one can buy and or sell unless he has that
[54:59.560 --> 55:04.960]  marked in the forehead or in the palm of their hand and we look back all the
[55:04.960 --> 55:09.120]  warnings you were given and all just a common sense that even believe in God
[55:09.120 --> 55:15.000]  we're promising giving governments corporations the power to control who
[55:15.000 --> 55:18.600]  can buy and who can sell to track everything we do he's not just a recipe
[55:18.600 --> 55:23.280]  it's a blueprint for total enslavement and now you look at Bill Gates you look
[55:23.280 --> 55:27.840]  at Bloomberg and others who openly say we're technocrats we should decide how
[55:27.840 --> 55:32.040]  much salt you get how much alcohol you get how much red meat you get we're
[55:32.040 --> 55:36.080]  technocrats we know best we're now gonna set up the economy with a social score
[55:36.080 --> 55:40.800]  to totally control you you snap your fingers we're here they're just rolling
[55:40.800 --> 55:46.440]  it out and a lot of people are complying with it it's insane this is your

[55:58.640 --> 56:02.920]  but because of the COVID supply chain breakdown because there's 13 different
[56:02.920 --> 56:08.480]  formulas in a pack power stack we are unable to secure it anymore this is the
[56:08.480 --> 56:13.440]  highest in a npm pack system you're gonna find where you take half the pills

[56:16.560 --> 56:19.920]  amazing I don't have time to go into everything that's in it but this gets
[56:19.920 --> 56:23.200]  people to remember to take it and that's why it's having such a great effect
[56:23.200 --> 56:26.280]  because the stuff in here is absolutely amazing what's your last chance to get

[56:45.000 --> 57:11.800]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[57:11.800 --> 57:16.720]  we don't want the governor the evil governor of Michigan or California or
[57:16.720 --> 57:22.760]  Pennsylvania or New York where they sent people that had COVID-19 and
[57:22.760 --> 57:26.960]  pneumonia to old people's nursing homes to kill them to jack up the death
[57:26.960 --> 57:31.320]  numbers and get money we don't want people to kidnap them or shoot them on
[57:31.320 --> 57:34.640]  the side of the street we want to have them indicted and that's moving forward
[57:34.640 --> 57:37.960]  in New York and other areas but I guess that's the false flag look for a
[57:37.960 --> 57:41.520]  militia to get busted trying to kidnap governor Cuomo I'm a militia to get
[57:41.520 --> 57:45.440]  busted trying to kidnap governor Wolfe Pennsylvania that's what's happened they
[57:45.440 --> 57:50.880]  the feds love Michigan they love setting up the good old boys up there oh I mean
[57:50.880 --> 57:54.160]  they've had so many feds leading those militias you can always tell the feds
[57:54.160 --> 57:59.080]  they always go shut up Jones you're a fed don't say militias are evil and
[57:59.080 --> 58:04.800]  unconstitutional and we're all feds I'm like I didn't say that I said a lot of
[58:04.800 --> 58:07.840]  times feds lead them it's come out hundreds of times and try to set people
[58:07.840 --> 58:12.920]  up and I mean I predicted they'd set up a tire militia because of one of the
[58:12.920 --> 58:16.960]  promo videos I saw him put out I mean I saw that and I was like oh they're gonna
[58:16.960 --> 58:21.960]  set that group up a year before they did I mean I know set ups when I see him and
[58:21.960 --> 58:25.400]  so do you hey here's president Trump talking about how he did this
[58:25.400 --> 58:28.320]  Regeneron and if it worked for him great he may have already had a blood
[58:28.320 --> 58:32.600]  infection he didn't know about he does seem supercharged rejuvenated you know
[58:32.600 --> 58:35.480]  the media's claiming he's on drugs or something I mean sometimes you take a
[58:35.480 --> 58:38.400]  bout of your antibiotics or something really makes you feel better he also
[58:38.400 --> 58:41.120]  took some of those are saying here's what the president had to say and about
[58:41.120 --> 58:46.640]  China they're gonna say that they're therapeutic and I guess they are
[58:46.640 --> 58:50.120]  therapeutic some people don't know how to define therapeutic I view it
[58:50.120 --> 58:55.560]  different it's a cure for me I walked in I didn't feel good a short 24 hours
[58:55.560 --> 58:59.560]  later I was feeling great I want to get out of the hospital and that's what I
[58:59.560 --> 59:04.160]  want for everybody I want everybody to be given the same treatment as your
[59:04.160 --> 59:09.280]  president but I spent four days there and I went in I wasn't feeling so hot
[59:09.280 --> 59:13.400]  and within a very short period of time they gave me Regeneron it's called
[59:13.400 --> 59:17.520]  Regeneron and other things too but I think this was the key but they gave me
[59:17.520 --> 59:24.200]  Regeneron and it was like unbelievable I felt good immediately I felt as good
[59:24.200 --> 59:30.680]  three days ago as they do now so I just want to say we have Regeneron we have a
[59:30.680 --> 59:35.520]  very similar drug from Eli Lilly and they're coming out and we're trying to
[59:35.520 --> 59:41.720]  get them on an emergency basis we've authorized it I've authorized it and if
[59:41.720 --> 59:45.680]  you're in the hospital and you're feeling really bad I think we're going to work
[59:45.680 --> 59:49.280]  it so that you get them and you're gonna get them free and especially if you're a
[59:49.280 --> 59:52.920]  senior we're gonna get you in there quick we have hundreds of thousands of
[59:52.920 --> 59:58.960]  doses that are just about ready I have emergency use authorization all set and
[59:58.960 --> 1:00:03.280]  we got to get it signed now and you're gonna get better you're gonna get better
[1:00:03.280 --> 1:00:07.320]  really fast this is things that nobody even thought of a few months ago the
[1:00:07.320 --> 1:00:11.680]  job that the scientists the labs everybody have done is incredible then
[1:00:11.680 --> 1:00:17.400]  addition to that you have various other drugs that help a lot but these I view
[1:00:17.400 --> 1:00:21.800]  these and now they call them therapeutic but to me it wasn't therapeutic it just
[1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:28.160]  made me better okay I call that a cure so I want to get these things done so we
[1:00:28.160 --> 1:00:31.040]  have to get them done we have to get them approved I want to get them to the
[1:00:31.040 --> 1:00:34.200]  hospital where people are feeling badly it's much more important to me than the
[1:00:34.200 --> 1:00:40.360]  vaccine so we have these drugs Eli Lilly and the others that are so good but they
[1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:45.400]  are in my opinion remember this they're gonna say that they're therapeutic and
[1:00:45.400 --> 1:00:48.560]  I guess they are therapeutic some people don't know how to define
[1:00:48.560 --> 1:00:52.840]  therapeutic I view a different it's a cure for me I walked in I didn't feel
[1:00:52.840 --> 1:00:57.200]  good a short 24 hours later I was feeling great I went to get out of the
[1:00:57.200 --> 1:01:02.240]  hospital and that's what I want for everybody I want everybody to be given
[1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:08.160]  the same treatment as your president because I feel great I feel like perfect
[1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:11.880]  now look what he's doing is he's taking away the narrative that we can never open
[1:01:11.880 --> 1:01:15.520]  back up again we've got to have a world collapse and financial collapse that's
[1:01:15.520 --> 1:01:18.720]  the globalist plan can solid a control start the third world that's why this is
[1:01:18.720 --> 1:01:22.840]  such a big deal and I've got news on that coming up next segment in fact guys I
[1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:26.000]  had a big article here I can't find about mass starvation at the highest levels
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:30.520]  ever seen and and also billions of meals are gonna be missed here in the
[1:01:30.520 --> 1:01:34.600]  United States alone but but regardless that's all coming up but also it's that
[1:01:34.600 --> 1:01:39.320]  COVID's not that strong if you've got you know a good diet and I think Trump's
[1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:41.960]  perfect but he gets a lot of calories I mean I guarantee he's taking a
[1:01:41.960 --> 1:01:45.680]  multivitamin so it also shows how weak COVID is and he was sick for two days
[1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:50.120]  that's what I'm saying most people never even get a fever with it he was 75 over
[1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:59.040]  wait so he did and perhaps most cruelly of all if Donald Trump has his way the
[1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:06.120]  complications from COVID-19 which are well beyond what they should be it's
[1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:12.560]  estimated that 200 million people have died 200 million people have died
[1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:17.720]  probably by the time I finish this talk right after Joe Biden made that
[1:02:17.720 --> 1:02:22.320]  statement that more than 60% of America has died from COVID-19 when it's not
[1:02:22.320 --> 1:02:27.000]  even 200,000 reality he would honestly say six million have lung scarring and
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:30.240]  heart damage it's all made up but you know where you got it the mainstream
[1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:35.240]  media that continues to actually say things like that they said that 4% of
[1:02:35.240 --> 1:02:40.760]  America would be dead already of course it's point zero zero zero zero and then
[1:02:40.760 --> 1:02:45.800]  add a number because the numbers vary it's a real virus just like people being
[1:02:45.800 --> 1:02:50.480]  struck by lightning is real but to shut down society over lightning strikes is
[1:02:50.480 --> 1:02:54.400]  hysteria and is mind-control
[1:02:54.400 --> 1:03:16.160]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news today you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:03:16.160 --> 1:03:28.640]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen broadcasting worldwide on this live
[1:03:28.640 --> 1:03:33.680]  Thursday edition Laura Loomer who's got a really good chance of winning an uphill
[1:03:33.680 --> 1:03:38.120]  battle but she's now ahead in Florida is gonna be joining us to talk about the
[1:03:38.120 --> 1:03:42.440]  election about the debates last night and so much more I have stacks of articles
[1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:46.520]  stacks of great video clips I have so much to get to but I've just got to go
[1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:50.160]  back to what I just spent most the last hour on because it all ties together
[1:03:50.160 --> 1:03:54.080]  America may need international intervention New York Times even
[1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:58.440]  Democrats I find it hard to imagine the leader of the free world would benefit
[1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:03.280]  from United Nations oversight now it just so happens he's saying this this
[1:04:03.280 --> 1:04:13.120]  globalist look look at the guy that wrote the article he's saying this while
[1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:17.720]  the Communist Party two days ago in the UN said we are a failed racist country
[1:04:17.720 --> 1:04:31.680]  that shouldn't even exist think about that that should not even exist because
[1:04:31.680 --> 1:04:36.880]  we're racist that that's the whole UN ethos and most the world's brown most
[1:04:36.880 --> 1:04:39.840]  the world in white so they can organize brown people that white people are bad
[1:04:39.840 --> 1:04:43.920]  and then use the UN to conquer via racial dominance of course they're gonna
[1:04:43.920 --> 1:04:47.760]  just get exploit the brown people I could always do it's the West has the
[1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:52.040]  idea of unifying us around freedom and Christianity that transcends what color
[1:04:52.040 --> 1:04:55.840]  we are it's been successful the UN doesn't want that they want the division
[1:04:55.840 --> 1:04:59.720]  and so we have Loretta Lynch the former attorney general all of saying have the
[1:04:59.720 --> 1:05:05.920]  UN occupy these cities and let's talk about what he says in the article he
[1:05:05.920 --> 1:05:11.560]  says the UN must be engaged in oversight of the president and America again what
[1:05:11.560 --> 1:05:17.720]  is oversight from a thesaurus mean us okay control handling inspection
[1:05:17.720 --> 1:05:21.760]  maintenance management surveillance administration which means governance
[1:05:21.760 --> 1:05:35.320]  guardianship guard keep own and so that's how this works it isn't UN troops
[1:05:35.320 --> 1:05:38.760]  come marching in your your local government goes under UN regulation
[1:05:38.760 --> 1:05:44.600]  agenda 21 agenda 2030 and then they just buy off your media they buy off the cops
[1:05:44.600 --> 1:05:48.320]  they buy everybody off but there they are all are for TV viewers you can see all
[1:05:48.320 --> 1:05:53.360]  the articles this is real radio listeners you can search this and so we're now
[1:05:53.360 --> 1:06:02.200]  far into the UN memorandum 7277 to take over this country and it's it's a big
[1:06:02.200 --> 1:06:08.880]  big deal and they just hope to have it come out and then just be over and they're
[1:06:08.880 --> 1:06:11.640]  very upset that Trump is pulling our troops out of all these countries where
[1:06:11.640 --> 1:06:14.440]  we pay for it where it doesn't even help the people that are there or us
[1:06:14.440 --> 1:06:18.480]  international interest but it helps the UN the chai comms and others that's why
[1:06:18.480 --> 1:06:23.920]  they're so violently angry right now at President Trump in America because they
[1:06:23.920 --> 1:06:27.920]  want the power Trump could be a bad guy they still hate him because he's in
[1:06:27.920 --> 1:06:32.360]  control himself he's a good guy in control they're really pissed he could
[1:06:32.360 --> 1:06:35.680]  be a horrible guy that wasn't giving them the power they hate him to it's about
[1:06:35.680 --> 1:06:39.360]  dominance it's about control now let's move in the last night's debate and why
[1:06:39.360 --> 1:06:44.640]  they're really upset there's all you need to know the lmundo deletes twitter
[1:06:44.640 --> 1:06:52.000]  poll following VP debate after Kamala gets crushed by 74 to 26 the last
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:56.120]  lmundo poll a few weeks ago when Trump had the debate I guess it was just last
[1:06:56.120 --> 1:06:59.520]  week she was like a hundred years ago so much is going on you know what I mean
[1:06:59.520 --> 1:07:02.640]  time is moving really fast but also it seems like forever it's like both the
[1:07:02.640 --> 1:07:11.040]  paradox last week he won Trump did by 66 and I agree Trump won but Pence just
[1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:15.800]  smashed her and he was seeing ends like well she's a woman he ganged up on her
[1:07:15.800 --> 1:07:21.000]  oh so a woman can't debate as good as a guy no there are women that can debate
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:27.440]  as good as men and Kamala Harris ain't it Kamala Harris is not good on her feet
[1:07:27.440 --> 1:07:32.760]  I mean she's better than Joe Biden who can barely talk that's why she's the
[1:07:32.760 --> 1:07:37.960]  replacement for him and they admit it Mike Pence just stopped on Kamala and
[1:07:37.960 --> 1:07:41.080]  debate moderator on transfer of power question I want to play this first
[1:07:41.080 --> 1:07:45.160]  because this ties into the whole UN situation everything ties back into
[1:07:45.160 --> 1:07:54.920]  this everything goes back into this issue where they say are you gonna allow
[1:07:54.920 --> 1:07:59.080]  the transfer of power and he's like you the Democrats are the ones that
[1:07:59.080 --> 1:08:01.960]  constantly try to block the transfer of power you're the ones tried to block us
[1:08:01.960 --> 1:08:04.880]  for four years you're the ones say you're gonna contest the election what are
[1:08:04.880 --> 1:08:08.320]  you talking about finally someone calling them out but see that's their
[1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:12.400]  narrative oh we're gonna contest and if you can test that then we say you're a
[1:08:12.400 --> 1:08:16.600]  dictator the UN needs to come in we're gonna activate race riots as the cover
[1:08:16.600 --> 1:08:22.800]  for what we're doing and a color revolution so if we get which one of
[1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:29.200]  the clips that is clip 26 when you talk about accepting the outcome of an
[1:08:29.200 --> 1:08:33.320]  election I must tell you senator your party has spent the last three and a
[1:08:33.320 --> 1:08:37.400]  half years trying to overturn the results of the last election finally
[1:08:37.400 --> 1:08:42.560]  reality hits this which between the eyes movement of Americans has only
[1:08:42.560 --> 1:08:46.200]  grown stronger in the last four years when you talk about accepting the
[1:08:46.200 --> 1:08:52.880]  outcome of the election I must tell you the senator your party has spent the
[1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:55.680]  last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last
[1:08:55.680 --> 1:09:02.280]  election it's amazing when Joe Biden was vice president of the United States the
[1:09:02.280 --> 1:09:07.560]  FBI actually spied on President Trump in my campaign I mean there were documents
[1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:12.360]  released this week that the CIA actually made a referral to the FBI
[1:09:12.360 --> 1:09:16.680]  documenting that those allegations were coming from the Hillary Clinton campaign
[1:09:16.680 --> 1:09:21.040]  and of course we've all seen the avalanche with what what you put the
[1:09:21.040 --> 1:09:27.160]  country through for for the better part of three years until it was found that
[1:09:27.160 --> 1:09:32.040]  there was no obstruction no collusion case closed and then senator Harris you
[1:09:32.040 --> 1:09:36.440]  and your colleagues in the in the Congress tried to impeach the president
[1:09:36.440 --> 1:09:41.560]  of the United States over a phone call and now Hillary Clinton has actually said
[1:09:41.560 --> 1:09:45.320]  to Joe Biden that under in her words under no circumstances should he concede
[1:09:45.320 --> 1:09:48.800]  the election so let me just say I think we're gonna win this election
[1:09:48.800 --> 1:09:53.960]  President Trump and I are fighting very powerful okay Laura Loomer's coming up

[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:23.040]  later in the next hour there's a bunch of other big guests throughout the day as
[1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:27.480]  we continue with our 24 plus hour marathon transmission 40 hours total
[1:15:27.480 --> 1:15:32.080]  past midnight tonight and I know you're awake and I know you're informed and
[1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:35.520]  oh you're awesome just don't forget to hit your email list your text message is
[1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:40.000]  your word of mouth hey the truth is live at 2020ElectionCenter.com to take the live
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:45.240]  feed headline bombshell New York Times calls for the UN to occupy the US
[1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:51.520]  during race war after election I mean they're really preparing for this they
[1:15:51.520 --> 1:15:55.920]  say what they're going to do this and so the censorship we've seen against Laura
[1:15:55.920 --> 1:16:00.400]  Loomers that he platforming not letting her you know use all these big tech
[1:16:00.400 --> 1:16:07.200]  functions of the technocracy like Uber like Airbnb that's now all basically
[1:16:07.200 --> 1:16:11.360]  happened to me I mean I operate through my family stuff through my wife's credit
[1:16:11.360 --> 1:16:15.960]  cards but when you try with Alex Jones they just say Alex Jones no you are
[1:16:15.960 --> 1:16:20.160]  refused service and it really is Trump's greatest failing that he's not
[1:16:20.160 --> 1:16:24.160]  addressed this with actual action when it's clear racketeering clearly criminal
[1:16:24.160 --> 1:16:28.480]  over the top and now they're shadow banning and banning everybody and
[1:16:28.480 --> 1:16:31.480]  admitting we're doing it for the election so Laura Loomers like hey it's
[1:16:31.480 --> 1:16:36.200]  okay I'll just go to Congress and get elected so she ran she won the primary
[1:16:36.200 --> 1:16:38.880]  and they said she wouldn't she went by much greater numbers even though the
[1:16:38.880 --> 1:16:41.960]  polls showed her winning well the polls show her neck and neck even in skewed
[1:16:41.960 --> 1:16:47.200]  polls right now or ahead of the Democrat right there in Trump's district so very
[1:16:47.200 --> 1:16:50.800]  exciting and so she's a microcosm of the rest of the world in the testament of
[1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:53.960]  taking action we'll talk some about her campaign coming up next segment right
[1:16:53.960 --> 1:16:57.320]  now what do you think of the debate last night I know you did a debate watch
[1:16:57.320 --> 1:17:02.320]  party I saw some of that online what do you make of the COVID lockdown what do
[1:17:02.320 --> 1:17:06.920]  you make of them trying to openly say that you in gonna take over what do you
[1:17:06.920 --> 1:17:13.720]  expect the deep state Democrats to pull coming up on November 4th the day after
[1:17:13.720 --> 1:17:17.400]  election well thanks so much for having me Alex it's a pleasure to be back on
[1:17:17.400 --> 1:17:21.160]  again and look I was I was watching the debate last night and one thing is
[1:17:21.160 --> 1:17:26.240]  clear that Kamala Harris is no match for Vice President Mike Pence she could
[1:17:26.240 --> 1:17:31.560]  barely keep up he absolutely fillied her last night and it sounds like she was
[1:17:31.560 --> 1:17:35.480]  just stuttering over her words I just noticed the lack of eloquence in her
[1:17:35.480 --> 1:17:39.700]  speech and just how much how much of a better speaker Vice President Mike
[1:17:39.700 --> 1:17:43.840]  Pence is compared to Kamala Harris and I also just found it to be like very
[1:17:43.840 --> 1:17:48.720]  bizarre you know like her the way that she was so condescending and this kind
[1:17:48.720 --> 1:17:53.680]  of mean girl smirk she had on her face the entire night I had a watch party but
[1:17:53.680 --> 1:17:57.320]  then I was also at a private fundraiser last night you know there are a lot of
[1:17:57.320 --> 1:18:03.640]  very successful people at the fundraiser and you know none of the men or the
[1:18:03.640 --> 1:18:06.800]  women and this was a mixed group too they're not all conservatives right this
[1:18:06.800 --> 1:18:11.920]  was a group of primarily Jewish individuals who I was in the room with
[1:18:11.920 --> 1:18:16.440]  last night some were Democrats some were Republican but nobody liked Kamala
[1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:23.220]  Harris she was very off-putting and so I think that hands down Mike Pence won the
[1:18:23.220 --> 1:18:28.000]  debate but you know regardless I don't I don't think it's really gonna matter on
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:32.920]  election day who wins because you know I'm hoping that President Trump wins but
[1:18:32.920 --> 1:18:36.400]  when I say it's not going to matter I do believe that the radical left is going
[1:18:36.400 --> 1:18:41.520]  to burn down the country one way or another they are going to try to you
[1:18:41.520 --> 1:18:44.920]  know burn cities down ahead of the election I think that one thing that we
[1:18:44.920 --> 1:18:49.840]  can one thing that we can anticipate is that you know regardless of what
[1:18:49.840 --> 1:18:52.680]  happens with the election results there's probably going to be massive
[1:18:52.680 --> 1:18:56.640]  amounts of political violence just like we've been seeing in the last few weeks
[1:18:56.640 --> 1:19:01.040]  and I predict that when President Trump wins you'll have Antifa you'll have
[1:19:01.040 --> 1:19:05.280]  Black Lives Matter people pouring into the streets trying to you know burn down
[1:19:05.280 --> 1:19:10.040]  the suburbs and I saw today that Nancy Pelosi is also adding fuel to the fire
[1:19:10.040 --> 1:19:13.760]  by talking about how we need to have a discussion regarding the 25th amendment
[1:19:13.760 --> 1:19:18.680]  and then you have you know propaganda that's being pushed out not only by
[1:19:18.680 --> 1:19:22.400]  Kamala Harris during the debate where she says that I don't know where this
[1:19:22.400 --> 1:19:25.440]  poll came from but I'm sure you caught it during the debate where she said that
[1:19:25.440 --> 1:19:31.960]  more Americans have a favorable view of the president of the Chinese Communist
[1:19:31.960 --> 1:19:35.480]  Party than they do President Trump I don't know how saying that during a
[1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:39.760]  vice presidential debate helps anyone besides China who I would argue that we're
[1:19:39.760 --> 1:19:43.880]  in a you know we're in a soft war with right now but that's what you're gonna
[1:19:43.880 --> 1:19:48.040]  get right that's what you're gonna get with Joe Biden or I should say a
[1:19:48.040 --> 1:19:52.200]  Kamala Harris presidency because we all know that she really is the face of of
[1:19:52.200 --> 1:19:57.320]  the campaign I found it to be quite striking two days ago Kamala Harris and
[1:19:57.320 --> 1:20:01.600]  Joe Biden had a new campaign out and Joe Biden was actually blurred in the
[1:20:01.600 --> 1:20:07.000]  background but Kamala Harris's face was front and center and so as a
[1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:11.720]  communications major you know what that tells me is that Kamala Harris is the
[1:20:11.720 --> 1:20:18.240]  one who's actually really running for president Laura what has it been like for
[1:20:18.240 --> 1:20:24.240]  you running in Florida that that people that aren't running for office wouldn't
[1:20:24.240 --> 1:20:27.560]  experience during this election because people that I talked to their public
[1:20:27.560 --> 1:20:31.840]  figures they actually find that Biden's way less popular than the media says
[1:20:31.840 --> 1:20:35.440]  there's a lot of undercover videos that came out people posing as Biden
[1:20:35.440 --> 1:20:38.520]  supporters inside their own meetings they hate him in fact a lot of them
[1:20:38.520 --> 1:20:43.080]  actually like Trump so really there is this secret Trump voter faction where
[1:20:43.080 --> 1:20:47.480]  people are really getting tired of the media trying to force feed them Harris
[1:20:47.480 --> 1:20:51.400]  and Biden well they definitely are lying about the polls I'll tell you I'm
[1:20:51.400 --> 1:20:54.840]  running for Congress here in Florida's 21st district which is actually home to
[1:20:54.840 --> 1:21:00.560]  President Trump and Palm Beach County is supposedly a blue area they say that the
[1:21:00.560 --> 1:21:04.880]  district that I'm running is in is supposedly D plus nine but there is an
[1:21:04.880 --> 1:21:09.880]  overwhelming support for not only my campaign but also President Trump's
[1:21:09.880 --> 1:21:14.920]  Florida just Palm Beach County is the location of those enormous Trump vote
[1:21:14.920 --> 1:21:19.560]  parades they actually originated here in Palm Beach County and I participated in
[1:21:19.560 --> 1:21:23.360]  one on the lead boat a couple weeks ago and there were over 2,200 boats with
[1:21:23.360 --> 1:21:27.800]  Trump flags everywhere Joe Biden was actually in Florida just a few days
[1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:33.240]  ago and they went to Little Havana in Miami which is full of Cubans I heard
[1:21:33.240 --> 1:21:36.200]  that they didn't have a good reception there because the Cubans have fled
[1:21:36.200 --> 1:21:39.760]  communism and they don't want to return to it with a Joe Biden Kamala Harris
[1:21:39.760 --> 1:21:43.520]  presidency then they went to Little Haiti and the Haitians didn't want to
[1:21:43.520 --> 1:21:46.440]  receive them well because the Haitians have a really dirty taste in their
[1:21:46.440 --> 1:21:50.440]  mouth about the Democrat Party given that Hillary Clinton and her foundation
[1:21:50.440 --> 1:21:54.240]  you know embezzled millions of dollars of aid that was supposed to go to the
[1:21:54.240 --> 1:21:58.240]  Haitians over a billion actually it's over a billion dollars and then then got
[1:21:58.240 --> 1:22:02.920]  implicated in the giant UN child kidnapping operation that even associated
[1:22:02.920 --> 1:22:07.560]  breasts you can't make this stuff up you can't pick it up so the Clint I don't
[1:22:07.560 --> 1:22:10.320]  know why the why the Democrats think they're gonna come to Florida and
[1:22:10.320 --> 1:22:13.560]  pander to the Cubans pander to the Haitians the black community and then
[1:22:13.560 --> 1:22:17.000]  they went to Century Village which was located in my district which is a
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:22.400]  predominantly senior Jewish community and Lois Frankel who I'm running against
[1:22:22.400 --> 1:22:26.520]  radical Democrat she was there and it was the funniest thing Alex because we
[1:22:26.520 --> 1:22:30.240]  actually had a sign waving and there were more Laura Loomer for Congress
[1:22:30.240 --> 1:22:34.080]  volunteers and Trump supporters waving signs than there were actual attendees
[1:22:34.080 --> 1:22:38.480]  of this so-called drive-in rally for Jill Biden and I saw some of that footage
[1:22:38.480 --> 1:22:41.680]  I forget the links send us that link during the break I want to I want to show
[1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:45.120]  that because I saw that in Florida and Palm Beach as here comes Biden I couldn't
[1:22:45.120 --> 1:22:49.960]  even see signs for Biden and I saw all those Trump Laura Loomer signs yeah and
[1:22:49.960 --> 1:22:53.400]  then as Jill and Joe Biden were driving in you just heard people chant Laura
[1:22:53.400 --> 1:22:58.360]  Loomer for Congress and four more years and you know it's embarrassing I mean
[1:22:58.360 --> 1:23:02.640]  it's so embarrassing for Joe Biden but they have to manufacture they have to
[1:23:02.640 --> 1:23:06.920]  manufacture press and and fake polls just like they did with Hillary Clinton I
[1:23:06.920 --> 1:23:12.000]  mean I recall you know all the coverage we did together in 2016 and you know I
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:15.200]  was in the room with President Trump the night the night he beat Hillary
[1:23:15.200 --> 1:23:18.480]  Clinton and I'll never remember that the election really could have been called
[1:23:18.480 --> 1:23:22.560]  around midnight but the reporters were refusing to call Pennsylvania when it
[1:23:22.560 --> 1:23:27.040]  went for President Trump so let's come back and talk about election night 25
[1:23:27.040 --> 1:23:30.760]  days out the Democrats say they're not gonna allow Trump to contest for
[1:23:30.760 --> 1:23:34.040]  declare victory they're gonna hold it up regardless till all quote ballots are
[1:23:34.040 --> 1:23:37.200]  counted which is impossible because they pumped 80 million up Mount have been
[1:23:37.200 --> 1:23:40.920]  harvesting them hoarding them sitting on them they're arresting people from
[1:23:40.920 --> 1:23:45.160]  Texas to Michigan running scams this is just the enemies got fixed up their
[1:23:45.160 --> 1:23:50.920]  sleeves I'm talking about what those could be straight ahead the globalists
[1:23:50.920 --> 1:23:55.720]  are very very honest about their planetary goals they want private
[1:23:55.720 --> 1:24:02.560]  corporate governance above nation-states above religious institutions above the
[1:24:02.560 --> 1:24:07.760]  family they want total corporate power there was a great film back in the early
[1:24:07.760 --> 1:24:14.000]  1970s called rollerball with James Kahn it's based on a novel set in the year
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:19.080]  2020 and in the book you have mega corporations that control the planet
[1:24:19.080 --> 1:24:25.320]  there are no longer nation-states there are only cities that are the capitals of
[1:24:25.320 --> 1:24:30.160]  the corporations if you actually read what the most group of the CFR to our
[1:24:30.160 --> 1:24:36.000]  commission say in the year 2020 that is their in game that is their goal so we're
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:40.360]  talking about a hunger games type scenario here run by very very very
[1:24:40.360 --> 1:24:44.960]  ruthless people see us as shadow they're using COVID-19 as their takeover
[1:24:44.960 --> 1:24:50.440]  strategy communist China as their model we must reject it now for more than a
[1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:54.320]  hundred years the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to establish world
[1:24:54.320 --> 1:24:58.800]  government abolish nation-states dumb down the population by taking control of
[1:24:58.800 --> 1:25:03.640]  education and most importantly taking control of Western medicine now they
[1:25:03.640 --> 1:25:08.400]  had a bad name by the 1920s they started converting over and funding other
[1:25:08.400 --> 1:25:13.080]  organizations and groups like IBM to continue on with their eugenics
[1:25:13.080 --> 1:25:19.320]  operations fast forward to the 1980s the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on
[1:25:19.320 --> 1:25:23.640]  the board of directors to Bill Gates the third his father of course being had a
[1:25:23.640 --> 1:25:27.960]  planned parenthood and now he's been able to position himself over almost every
[1:25:27.960 --> 1:25:33.920]  health department in the world every national health system Bill Gates is in
[1:25:33.920 --> 1:25:38.960]  control they have spent a hundred plus years getting positioned to be able to
[1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:43.480]  control what happens to your body and what goes in your body this is the holy
[1:25:43.480 --> 1:25:48.520]  grail of their operations and now they're normalizing putting a new type of DNA in
[1:25:48.520 --> 1:25:54.600]  your body the future isn't coming it's here and in the future keeping your
[1:25:54.600 --> 1:26:00.520]  humanity saving your soul your integrity your very essence is going to be your
[1:26:00.520 --> 1:26:05.840]  most valuable asset in fact it's going to be your only asset the world being
[1:26:05.840 --> 1:26:10.960]  built by the technocrats the trap they've now sprung of COVID-19 and the
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:15.540]  endless lockdown is the beginning of the process of taking us past
[1:26:15.540 --> 1:26:22.520]  domestication into total and complete dehumanization human life will be
[1:26:22.520 --> 1:26:27.720]  impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year
[1:26:27.720 --> 1:26:33.720]  2050 this is their stated goal I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things
[1:26:33.720 --> 1:26:38.600]  like this to you but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own
[1:26:38.600 --> 1:26:43.160]  decency onto the enemy we turn this around you must study their own writings
[1:26:43.160 --> 1:26:47.800]  you must face the facts and you must come to grips with it you're all being
[1:26:47.800 --> 1:26:50.840]  incrementally destroyed
[1:26:50.840 --> 1:26:57.720]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:27:21.840 --> 1:27:27.880]  we are back live I am your host Alex Jones honored and blessed to be with
[1:27:27.880 --> 1:27:32.200]  you on this October 8th 2020 Thursday
[1:27:32.200 --> 1:27:37.120]  transmission 104 days off from the election that's right I said that on
[1:27:37.120 --> 1:27:41.640]  purpose we're 25 days technically to the election but until President Trump is
[1:27:41.640 --> 1:27:48.000]  seated as president again on that inauguration in DC we're not out of the
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:53.560]  woods because the end game of the election is getting him seated and the
[1:27:53.560 --> 1:27:57.480]  deep state intends to contest it a hundred times worse they did last time
[1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:01.440]  by breaking the country up and having the UN declare that the election was
[1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:06.600]  illegitimate the New York Times just announced that I mean that's it New
[1:28:06.600 --> 1:28:15.280]  York Times tips its hand you in to uncertify us election we're going back
[1:28:15.280 --> 1:28:19.040]  to Laura Loomer here in a moment but speaking of that Gateway Pundit wrote
[1:28:19.040 --> 1:28:22.080]  about it in full wars wrote about it you can go see the screenshots see the
[1:28:22.080 --> 1:28:26.840]  video for yourself you've got Pence up there with Chinese subtitles it was
[1:28:26.840 --> 1:28:31.800]  being aired on national TV Kamala Harris attack team said that we lost the trade
[1:28:31.800 --> 1:28:39.320]  war that China was good that we were bad and Pence began to counter that first
[1:28:39.320 --> 1:28:43.200]  let's play 13 and they censored 14 those the clipwaters I have it's the same
[1:28:43.200 --> 1:28:47.560]  area of the tape and when he started talking about how we really won the
[1:28:47.560 --> 1:28:54.200]  trade war it went B to the bar code you know the you know the rainbow colors up
[1:28:54.200 --> 1:29:02.280]  there and said lost transmission and so international media is reporting on this
[1:29:02.280 --> 1:29:05.000]  and then every time he started bringing up something else they would do the same
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  thing as well so we already experienced that episode ship online but now it's
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:12.640]  coming to television we continue to follow the Communist Chinese model so
[1:29:12.640 --> 1:29:22.120]  here's what they censored regard to China look Susan first and foremost China is
[1:29:22.120 --> 1:29:27.520]  to blame for the coronavirus and President Trump is not happy about it
[1:29:27.520 --> 1:29:31.640]  he's made that very clear made it clear again today and China and the World
[1:29:31.640 --> 1:29:35.360]  Health Organization did not play straight with the American people they did not
[1:29:35.360 --> 1:29:40.000]  let our personnel into China to get information on the coronavirus until the
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:45.280]  middle of February fortunately President Trump in dealing with China from the
[1:29:45.280 --> 1:29:48.440]  outset of this administration standing up to China that had been taking
[1:29:48.440 --> 1:29:53.160]  advantage of America for decades in the wake of Joe Biden's cheerleading for
[1:29:53.160 --> 1:29:57.720]  China President Trump made that decision before the end of January to suspend all
[1:29:57.720 --> 1:30:02.600]  travel from China and again the American people deserve to know Joe Biden opposed
[1:30:02.600 --> 1:30:07.280]  President Trump's decision to suspend all travel from China he said it was
[1:30:07.280 --> 1:30:14.200]  hysterical he said we're gonna continue to stand strong thank you vice
[1:30:14.200 --> 1:30:17.120]  president we want to improve the relationship but we're gonna level the
[1:30:17.120 --> 1:30:20.600]  playing field we're gonna hold China accountable for what they did to America
[1:30:20.600 --> 1:30:25.040]  with the coronavirus thank you all right the next she counters he responds and
[1:30:25.040 --> 1:30:28.520]  the color bars come up I was calling it the rainbow thing I'm turning to Joe
[1:30:28.520 --> 1:30:33.120]  Biden you know we pledge allegiance to well you know the thing I'm like what
[1:30:33.120 --> 1:30:36.080]  do you call those rainbow things you know the thing color bars go up saying
[1:30:36.080 --> 1:30:42.040]  stand by signal lost but it wasn't no signal and just incredible so let's go
[1:30:42.040 --> 1:30:45.720]  ahead and play the actual clip that they did censor here it is senator here
[1:30:45.720 --> 1:30:50.840]  let's talk about that you the vice president earlier referred to it as part
[1:30:50.840 --> 1:30:56.120]  of what he thinks is an accomplishment that the president's trade war with
[1:30:56.120 --> 1:31:03.280]  China you lost that trade war you lost it what ended up happening is because of
[1:31:03.280 --> 1:31:09.480]  a so-called trade war with China America lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs
[1:31:09.480 --> 1:31:15.640]  farmers have experienced bankruptcy because of it we are in a manufacturing
[1:31:15.640 --> 1:31:22.080]  recession because of it and when we look at where this administration has been
[1:31:22.080 --> 1:31:26.760]  by the way pause just hit pause the same thing happened with big Mike and when
[1:31:26.760 --> 1:31:29.920]  she did that whole 25 minute unwatchable thing I watched the whole thing was
[1:31:29.920 --> 1:31:36.200]  telling a torture never seen such lies just every words a lie keep saying it's
[1:31:36.200 --> 1:31:40.080]  Trump that caused the shutdown of the economy it's no it's the media hyping it
[1:31:40.080 --> 1:31:43.840]  demanding it blue states blue cities big tech setting the president and then
[1:31:43.840 --> 1:31:47.360]  Trump went halfway along with it and then you call the global depression you
[1:31:47.360 --> 1:31:50.800]  started something he did when you were the ones bragging that you did it to
[1:31:50.800 --> 1:31:58.560]  punish us you monsters and she just hopes and prays every day that you don't
[1:31:58.560 --> 1:32:03.800]  remember what they really did and we're here to remind you and remind others and
[1:32:03.800 --> 1:32:07.320]  play the clips of them saying we want to deep-six the economy and now they want
[1:32:07.320 --> 1:32:10.480]  to deep-six the dollar even if Trump isn't in because they want to loot the
[1:32:10.480 --> 1:32:15.960]  country so if they deep-six the dollar remember they did it
[1:32:15.960 --> 1:32:19.520]  God they're incredibly evil oh hey Laura Loomer had a power out it just seems
[1:32:19.520 --> 1:32:22.240]  to happen all the time with our guests so that's why I'm not making her hold
[1:32:22.240 --> 1:32:25.720]  during this we're trying to get her back on let's go back to the clip
[1:32:25.720 --> 1:32:30.680]  estimates that by the end of the term of this administration they will have
[1:32:30.680 --> 1:32:37.480]  lost more jobs and pause again they want a two trillion plus dollar carbon tax to
[1:32:37.480 --> 1:32:41.720]  begin that no one else in the world in China and India has to pay making it
[1:32:41.720 --> 1:32:46.840]  impossible to do business here they want us to keep getting the most expensive
[1:32:46.840 --> 1:32:49.640]  drugs in the world from China when Trump's cutting out the middlemen these
[1:32:49.640 --> 1:32:54.000]  people openly want to rape you if you know anything Trump is doing everything
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:33:02.280]  you do to help the people it's true any moron could look into any one of these
[1:33:02.280 --> 1:33:07.320]  things but no I got a clip coming up where where she goes we're not gonna
[1:33:07.320 --> 1:33:12.280]  be in fracky we're gonna restrict it that's a lie she says that's a lie and
[1:33:12.280 --> 1:33:17.560]  waves her hand and that's a lie I don't fly flies out of her you know wrist and
[1:33:17.560 --> 1:33:24.600]  lands on him but she's on video and so is Biden in the last year saying I promise
[1:33:24.600 --> 1:33:30.640]  you we're gonna ban fossil fuels that'd be the total cuts worse than banning
[1:33:30.640 --> 1:33:36.760]  fracking maybe like you said I'm gonna ban white bread you know I heard you're
[1:33:36.760 --> 1:33:43.800]  gonna ban white bread I'm not that's not true I'm gonna ban all bread just a
[1:33:43.800 --> 1:33:46.640]  little I'm sorry I'm sure they might watching that debate last night the
[1:33:46.640 --> 1:33:50.680]  crew is it's a good job I didn't come in I watched it though and I mean he just
[1:33:50.680 --> 1:33:54.800]  Pence is gonna make a great president man I wish he was younger you know how
[1:33:54.800 --> 1:33:58.400]  it works though Democrats probably get some money in in four years Pence is
[1:33:58.400 --> 1:34:03.080]  dynamite he's just smarter than Trump many ways but doesn't have the populist
[1:34:03.080 --> 1:34:07.000]  inning well let's just say this he's gotten better with Trump the two have
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:13.960]  made each other better but let's go back to Kamala go ahead other presidential
[1:34:13.960 --> 1:34:19.120]  administration and the American people know what I'm talking about you know I
[1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:24.720]  think about 20 year olds you know we have a 20 year old 20 something year old
[1:34:24.720 --> 1:34:28.200]  who are coming out of high school in college right now and you're wondering
[1:34:28.200 --> 1:34:33.000]  is there gonna be a job there for me we're looking at people who are trying
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:37.440]  to figure out how they're gonna pay rent by the end of the month almost half of
[1:34:37.440 --> 1:34:41.560]  American renters are worried about whether they're gonna be able to pay their
[1:34:41.560 --> 1:34:45.880]  whole system is about bankrupting destroying the economy making it not
[1:34:45.880 --> 1:34:48.760]  work so you've got to go into their control so they can make you pour
[1:34:48.760 --> 1:34:51.640]  permanently and in the middle class that's the whole leftist plan
[1:34:51.640 --> 1:34:55.600]  flowered and pivot and she they've done everything to do this Trump turned it
[1:34:55.600 --> 1:34:59.480]  around in a couple years they reverse it with their damn COVID crap and then
[1:34:59.480 --> 1:35:03.480]  they have the nerve to go people are worried about money he's gonna take your
[1:35:03.480 --> 1:35:10.160]  money away continue end of the month this is where the economy is in America
[1:35:10.160 --> 1:35:15.840]  right now and it is because of the catastrophe and the failure of leadership
[1:35:15.840 --> 1:35:20.120]  of this administration wow thank you senator Harris price prison pencil me
[1:35:20.120 --> 1:35:23.840]  give you just 15 seconds to respond because then I want to well plastic up
[1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:29.560]  between them God lost the trade war with China Joe Biden never fought it
[1:35:29.560 --> 1:35:33.760]  Joe Biden's been a cheerleader for Communist China through over the last
[1:35:33.760 --> 1:35:38.400]  several decades and they cut this is what China cut in her hair your title to
[1:35:38.400 --> 1:35:41.680]  your opinion you're not entitled to your own facts when Joe Biden's vice
[1:35:41.680 --> 1:35:46.840]  president we lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs and President Obama said they were
[1:35:46.840 --> 1:35:49.800]  never coming back he said we needed a magic wand to bring by the way the
[1:35:49.800 --> 1:35:53.600]  Democrats demanded those those barriers be there rollback regulation
[1:35:53.600 --> 1:36:00.240]  unleashed energy this administration saw 500,000 jobs created and that's
[1:36:00.240 --> 1:36:03.760]  exactly the kind of growth we're going to continue to see as we bring our nation
[1:36:03.760 --> 1:36:08.320]  through thank you very much pandemic green new deal your massive mandate your
[1:36:08.320 --> 1:36:11.800]  Paris climate accord it's going to kill jobs this time just like it killed
[1:36:11.800 --> 1:36:16.680]  jobs I just need to respond very quickly thank you thank you that's enough
[1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:22.360]  from her we're going to break people didn't watch the full debate it's on
[1:36:22.360 --> 1:36:27.840]  enforce.com but but but notice that the Communist Chinese didn't cut it off when
[1:36:27.840 --> 1:36:31.400]  he blamed them for COVID but when he said we don't want the carbon taxes and
[1:36:31.400 --> 1:36:36.120]  China's exempt from them they're like cut that off because that shuts us down we
[1:36:36.120 --> 1:36:39.600]  cannot operate on those carbon taxes hopefully Laura Loomer can get back up
[1:36:39.600 --> 1:36:43.200]  with us the Hodge twins are coming up regardless I'm Alex Jones info wars.com
[1:36:43.200 --> 1:36:47.960]  tomorrow's news today whatever you do do not share those live links
[1:36:48.400 --> 1:36:53.800]  the Bible talks about there being 10 kings of the earth that sit above the
[1:36:53.800 --> 1:36:58.280]  nation states and who give their power unto the one world leader the anti-Christ
[1:36:58.280 --> 1:37:03.400]  and he has a beast system that no one should buy and or sell unless he has
[1:37:03.400 --> 1:37:07.920]  that mark in the forehead or in the palm of their hand and we look back on all
[1:37:07.920 --> 1:37:12.880]  the warnings you were given and all just the common sense that even believe in
[1:37:12.880 --> 1:37:18.960]  God or prophecy giving governments corporations the power to control who
[1:37:18.960 --> 1:37:22.560]  can buy and who can sell to track everything we do he's not just a recipe
[1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:27.240]  it's a blueprint for total enslavement and now you look at Bill Gates you look
[1:37:27.240 --> 1:37:31.800]  at Bloomberg and others who openly say we're technocrats we should decide how
[1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:36.040]  much salt you get how much alcohol you get how much red meat you get we're
[1:37:36.040 --> 1:37:40.040]  technocrats we know best we're now gonna set up the economy with a social score
[1:37:40.040 --> 1:37:44.760]  to totally control you you snap your fingers we're here they're just rolling
[1:37:44.760 --> 1:37:50.080]  it out and a lot of people are complying with it it's insane computer
[1:37:50.080 --> 1:37:55.240]  research scientists engineers working with attorneys have conclusively proven
[1:37:55.240 --> 1:38:00.080]  and put out the failed reports at Tablet magazine documenting what any trained
[1:38:00.080 --> 1:38:05.400]  I could already see as plain as day communist Chinese working in tandem
[1:38:05.400 --> 1:38:08.800]  with the United Nations and the Democratic Party in the United States as
[1:38:08.800 --> 1:38:13.960]  well as the media put out fake videos and total hysteria to make it look like
[1:38:13.960 --> 1:38:19.080]  day of the dead into the world in China earlier this year then the UN put out
[1:38:19.080 --> 1:38:23.080]  standardized rules designed to keep the West locked down when China reopened
[1:38:23.080 --> 1:38:29.920]  within three months this is the greatest strategic ever this is 21st century
[1:38:29.920 --> 1:38:35.720]  warfare being carried out psychological means for the ultimate style Paul Joseph
[1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:40.160]  Watson has written about it at info wars.com myself Alex Jones David I know
[1:38:40.160 --> 1:38:43.840]  and sure covering this heavily this is the way to bring down the globalist is
[1:38:43.840 --> 1:38:50.320]  exposing how communist China the UN were behind the hysteria are you sick and

[1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:39.280]  calling for the UN to occupy the US that subject and what you think of the
[1:41:39.280 --> 1:41:44.640]  debate last night and Mike Pence will only have time to probably take ten

[1:42:15.200 --> 1:42:19.800]  but we don't want unlimited power in the government but you can't have a bunch
[1:42:19.800 --> 1:42:22.600]  of rioters be their own government under themselves we know that's the worst
[1:42:22.600 --> 1:42:29.000]  form one of the worst forms the new footage and then have Kamala Harris
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:32.480]  saying oh I'm with the peaceful protesters and oh I'm with them in
[1:42:32.480 --> 1:42:37.480]  Wisconsin and oh they're all good people it's just not true breaking rioters in

[1:44:56.400 --> 1:45:03.760]  with you pretend like you're this good liberal you're not you're a monster
[1:45:03.760 --> 1:45:07.760]  you know that guy's even worse than the people loot in the yard at least they're
[1:45:07.760 --> 1:45:22.360]  just mindless criminals he just plays games so it's a bunch of thugs want to
[1:45:22.360 --> 1:45:26.560]  attack white people here's the white guy begging them just pleading with them
[1:45:26.560 --> 1:45:31.120]  see how far that gets you in the end buddy they got somebody going crazy and
[1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:36.680]  revving their motorcycle up the front yard they go let's pass him on we don't
[1:45:36.680 --> 1:45:39.040]  need to hit him in there with a bike lock he's submitting and groveling he's
[1:45:39.040 --> 1:45:43.040]  scared of us how many any of us say I come out here to feel powerful like a
[1:45:43.040 --> 1:45:48.880]  few people scared of me here's another video this is probably the most powerful
[1:45:48.880 --> 1:45:53.440]  cashier at businesses in the same town because a black cop shot a black guy
[1:45:53.440 --> 1:45:58.400]  being pillaged by black lives matter writers hand out plastic bags to help
[1:45:58.400 --> 1:46:06.960]  carry out the looted goods here's that footage he is actually giving out bags
[1:46:06.960 --> 1:46:21.120]  no way folks have never seen anything like it the Stockholm syndrome in now
[1:46:21.120 --> 1:46:25.360]  guys let's explain what's happening here the globalist have taken over the
[1:46:25.360 --> 1:46:29.560]  cities destroyed them done her by down ship drugs in preach that white people
[1:46:29.560 --> 1:46:33.160]  are bad America sucks and now they're gonna burn all the buildings close all
[1:46:33.160 --> 1:46:39.120]  the shops they never come back and then it flushes all those folks out into the
[1:46:39.120 --> 1:46:42.880]  neighborhoods of hard-working Americans of every race color and Greek that's why
[1:46:42.880 --> 1:46:47.440]  Obama said before he left obviously signed a law saying the country side is
[1:46:47.440 --> 1:46:53.480]  racist and capitalist we're gonna build 10 story on average with the jenna 21
[1:46:53.480 --> 1:46:58.880]  model to you and model in any will town and then we'll bring in people that we
[1:46:58.880 --> 1:47:03.560]  control who are on welfare who run your life and then they will burn things
[1:47:03.560 --> 1:47:09.280]  whenever we want if we give the order to the media and so here you see it going
[1:47:09.280 --> 1:47:14.200]  up and attacking little townhouses I mean I'd say these are blue collar houses
[1:47:14.200 --> 1:47:18.640]  for Wisconsin you get a pretty big house for not a lot in Wisconsin these are
[1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:24.760]  these are this is a small town these are looks like four plexus so their
[1:47:24.760 --> 1:47:30.520]  apartments and you've got roving ribs of blacks mainly led by some white
[1:47:30.520 --> 1:47:36.840]  methods knocking out windows and attacking people's doors and of course
[1:47:36.840 --> 1:47:40.960]  Soros thinks somebody's gonna actually shoot one of these people someday and
[1:47:40.960 --> 1:47:44.920]  hopefully they're white and then you can have a bigger race war and the UN has
[1:47:44.920 --> 1:47:48.400]  said we're gonna come in during the race war and declare that this was a fake
[1:47:48.400 --> 1:47:55.240]  election and say that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the presidents boom just
[1:47:55.240 --> 1:47:59.720]  like that oh the UN says who won the election oh the UN says what you can
[1:47:59.720 --> 1:48:05.840]  say about COVID-19 or hydroxychloroquine oh the UN this local hospital owner that
[1:48:05.840 --> 1:48:09.000]  says they've gotten thousands of patients with COVID-19 and every one of them has
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:13.600]  done well on zinc hydroxychloroquine and Z-PAC which kills bacteria that carry
[1:48:13.600 --> 1:48:18.840]  viruses a lot of times actually dying of a bacterial infection but they'll call
[1:48:18.840 --> 1:48:24.280]  it viral because the virus is also there basically 100% recovery if it's
[1:48:24.280 --> 1:48:28.520]  caught early to mid-stage and they went well the UN doesn't agree with that so
[1:48:28.520 --> 1:48:32.520]  you're banned and then all these medical doctors and mainline magazines and
[1:48:32.520 --> 1:48:36.600]  mainline hospitals got banned off YouTube Twitter Facebook were saying hey we
[1:48:36.600 --> 1:48:43.440]  recommend you take vitamin D3 zinc and vitamin C well the FBI rated
[1:48:43.440 --> 1:48:47.360]  folks in California Michigan and Florida doctors for telling their people
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:52.080]  that came in scared hey what do I do they said vitamin C they said the FBI
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:55.800]  rated the grand jury indicted they said we don't care if you have a medical
[1:48:55.800 --> 1:48:59.920]  degree we don't care which legal what you did the UN said there's no
[1:48:59.920 --> 1:49:07.000]  preventative or cure for COVID-19 you're getting handcuffs put on you and then
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:12.360]  weird FBI lawyers like point machine guns at you you're bad cuz I put a machine
[1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:17.000]  gun at you I mean it's just psychotic leftist evil all trained in universities
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:21.800]  that they're the ruling class they're the gods they control us every and then
[1:49:21.800 --> 1:49:27.960]  the God Fauci came out a month ago and he said it would be good to take vitamin
[1:49:27.960 --> 1:49:35.080]  D and C to help you you need it he goes if you are deficient well yeah cuz of
[1:49:35.080 --> 1:49:39.600]  any virus will kill you if you don't have enough vitamin D or vitamin C it'll
[1:49:39.600 --> 1:49:46.960]  kill you kill you there's a whole bunch of up but again I even had personal
[1:49:46.960 --> 1:49:51.400]  people I know well but they're still older than me smarter than me I had a
[1:49:51.400 --> 1:49:55.200]  high-powered lawyer I'm friends with a no go Alex I thought you were making that
[1:49:55.200 --> 1:49:59.720]  up about vitamin D and stuff huh why Fauci's and he was he was the lawyer was
[1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:07.880]  looking at me like oh Fauci agreed with you oh my god how how did you know that
[1:50:07.880 --> 1:50:20.480]  before this is the psychotic mental illness of the public the FBI raids with
[1:50:20.480 --> 1:50:28.760]  machine guns doctors that give people vitamin C think about that that is the
[1:50:28.760 --> 1:50:36.440]  level of patheticness we are under we are under UN control right now and Trump
[1:50:36.440 --> 1:50:40.760]  started doing the right thing when he pulled us out of the WHO we need out of
[1:50:40.760 --> 1:50:45.840]  the whole UN all its boards are run by Marxist and Leninist the WHO leader is
[1:50:45.840 --> 1:50:50.360]  a Marxist Leninist that helped murder a bunch of people and round them up in
[1:50:50.360 --> 1:50:57.080]  Africa God help us alright I'm gonna go to break I'm coming right back with your
[1:50:57.080 --> 1:51:02.960]  calls in two minutes Doyle Josh Bob Brian Debbie Pete David Nuthers on the UN
[1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:07.000]  takeover on all of them look the UN controls what you can say the UN
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:11.120]  controls what doctors can prescribe and the UN says they control our election
[1:51:11.120 --> 1:51:16.200]  and I expect the FBI if Trump says he really won they'll probably swap they'll
[1:51:16.200 --> 1:51:20.920]  probably blow his head off and say you said you won the UN said you didn't it
[1:51:20.920 --> 1:51:25.080]  just blow his head off that's how they are just a cult the whole damn
[1:51:25.080 --> 1:51:31.600]  government's a cult of scum and filth and trash and garbage and communists God
[1:51:31.600 --> 1:51:37.080]  almighty damn them to hell our number three straight ahead
[1:51:37.600 --> 1:51:42.520]  we've now entered month number eight of the global lockdown and it's horrible
[1:51:42.520 --> 1:51:46.800]  and it's killing millions of people via starvation but the good news is it's
[1:51:46.800 --> 1:51:52.280]  caused a planetary awakening as well the general public all over the planet
[1:51:52.280 --> 1:51:57.480]  hate Bill Gates he's the most unpopular person on earth people know he's not a
[1:51:57.480 --> 1:52:02.640]  doctor people know he's a eugenicist the population knows that his vaccines that
[1:52:02.640 --> 1:52:06.000]  he pushes have been filled with cancer viruses polio
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:10.720]  sterilants and more it's even the associated press so now they are
[1:52:10.720 --> 1:52:14.960]  beginning to understand that we the people know that there is a corporate
[1:52:14.960 --> 1:52:19.160]  global government and the beast top tech billionaires sit in meetings and
[1:52:19.160 --> 1:52:23.600]  decide to pull the type of race war scams and coronavirus scams that we're
[1:52:23.600 --> 1:52:28.840]  witnessing so remember that and let them know that we know who they are and
[1:52:28.840 --> 1:52:32.400]  what they've done and we hold them responsible for the collapse of
[1:52:32.400 --> 1:52:40.080]  civilization they are the enemies of humanity they want you dead this is

[1:54:06.720 --> 1:54:21.440]  all right let's go to your calls right now let's go to Brian in pencil venue
[1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:31.200]  thanks for holding go ahead thank you sir crazy times absolutely I I was
[1:54:31.200 --> 1:54:36.000]  basically just triggered when I heard about the New York Times article what
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:41.280]  comes to mind you know I'm not that old but I do have a very vivid memory of you
[1:54:41.280 --> 1:54:47.400]  know my grandmother who was watching over me back in the 90s crying her eyes
[1:54:47.400 --> 1:54:54.440]  out as Quinton ordered the bombing of Yugoslavia civilian targets and that
[1:54:54.440 --> 1:55:01.040]  me shows the true colors of the United Nations that is what they're going to do
[1:55:01.040 --> 1:55:04.440]  by the way they didn't just drop bombs on Belgrade they dropped depleted uranium
[1:55:04.440 --> 1:55:11.160]  on civilian targets yeah so if they can rewrite the rules of
[1:55:11.160 --> 1:55:16.400]  engagement and the rules of war to bomb civilian targets I mean anything's on the
[1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:21.200]  table for these people and you know and let us not forget you know the Nazi
[1:55:21.200 --> 1:55:26.400]  involvement in the creation of all this stuff you you know the United Nations
[1:55:26.400 --> 1:55:33.560]  it all has a very end game feel to it in my estimation the you know the the
[1:55:33.560 --> 1:55:39.080]  power brokers are still in play Soros is only one that we know his name and there
[1:55:39.080 --> 1:55:43.440]  are many others heirs to massive amounts of Nazi fortune that is largely still
[1:55:43.440 --> 1:55:49.200]  accounted for but yeah if they're going to drop bombs on civilian targets you
[1:55:49.200 --> 1:55:52.600]  know I guess there's more involvement there if you want to talk about Libya and
[1:55:52.600 --> 1:55:56.160]  Marilyn Albright is Secretary of State oversaw the bombing of Serbia you know
[1:55:56.160 --> 1:56:00.720]  that you and admitted the other group started the war and the twice as many
[1:56:00.720 --> 1:56:05.120]  Serbs had died I'm not taking a side I'm taking a side on facts she got saved
[1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:09.680]  from the Nazis by the Serbs and then she repaid them by bombing them I mean
[1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:14.520]  it's just there's always next level with these people absolutely and I think
[1:56:14.520 --> 1:56:19.920]  even more appropriate to bring up the latest involvement of Trump you know
[1:56:19.920 --> 1:56:25.120]  bringing these different factions to the table for the first time short maybe you
[1:56:25.120 --> 1:56:28.680]  know all the cultural difference that started the show I said why does the
[1:56:28.680 --> 1:56:31.920]  U.N. want Trump out because he's not letting the US be the police force to
[1:56:31.920 --> 1:56:36.240]  bomb everybody he said no more nation building we're gonna make trade deals
[1:56:36.240 --> 1:56:40.200]  and we're gonna build hotels in these people's countries that's how you you
[1:56:40.200 --> 1:56:46.360]  actually have relationships with people you don't rape them so imagine if you
[1:56:46.360 --> 1:56:52.080]  were one of these power brokers to authorize dropping depleted uranium on
[1:56:52.080 --> 1:56:56.000]  civilian targets and now you're still you know you're still with it you're still
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:57:01.040]  around you still have some power and here comes Trump totally undermining that
[1:57:01.040 --> 1:57:05.720]  aggression and bringing these people to the table and with at least some hope of
[1:57:05.720 --> 1:57:09.440]  or some semblance of peace of Trump's absolutely and Trump's always been
[1:57:09.440 --> 1:57:14.120]  against offensive war and and he's he absolutely that's why Trump's so good
[1:57:14.120 --> 1:57:17.840]  and can you believe that the average liberal is not supporting Trump when he
[1:57:17.840 --> 1:57:24.920]  he should have the peace prize on Obama I can I can absolutely believe it the
[1:57:24.920 --> 1:57:30.400]  toxicity of the educational kind of state that we're in right now is
[1:57:30.400 --> 1:57:35.720]  unbelievable I've seen it with my own two eyes and participated in it you know
[1:57:35.720 --> 1:57:41.400]  got out with my sanity thank God but a lot of people can't and through no fault
[1:57:41.400 --> 1:57:46.000]  of their own they're just totally consumed by it that's right once you buy
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:49.600]  into their lives you have to buy it all because it's your identity and then
[1:57:49.600 --> 1:57:52.640]  they're just too far gone and next they're just randomly burning down
[1:57:52.640 --> 1:57:58.080]  people's houses because they're because they're white right I mean if you want
[1:57:58.080 --> 1:58:02.160]  to get a PhD right now in some sort of archaeological study do you think you
[1:58:02.160 --> 1:58:07.640]  can come out in question you know how old the Sphinx might be I mean the same
[1:58:07.640 --> 1:58:11.480]  holds true for different degrees I mean if you go all of science was about
[1:58:11.480 --> 1:58:15.520]  asking questions now it's about orthodoxy because now it's a religion of the elite
[1:58:15.520 --> 1:58:20.560]  for their power it's not about real searching out right and there's like
[1:58:20.560 --> 1:58:26.440]  this aspect of an esoteric kind of thing that permeates all of it oh it's
[1:58:26.440 --> 1:58:30.320]  definitely an esoteric group trying to suppress what they already know that
[1:58:30.320 --> 1:58:35.040]  we're ancient we're not alone and there is good and evil amazing call Brian back
[1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:40.920]  in 60 seconds with a bunch of other incredible callers stay with us
[1:58:40.920 --> 1:58:52.600]  the Renaissance the great enlightenment it's all being swept away and being
[1:58:52.600 --> 1:59:00.680]  replaced by scientific tyranny that's establishing a form of planetary digital
[1:59:00.680 --> 1:59:06.960]  law where the technocrats are above the law the public isn't even considered to
[1:59:06.960 --> 1:59:12.200]  be as valuable as a cow that humans are seen as garbage that's going to be
[1:59:12.200 --> 1:59:18.520]  taken out and removed that is the post human extermination plan that is the
[1:59:18.520 --> 1:59:22.680]  public ideology of the globalists and everything they've built with this high
[1:59:22.680 --> 1:59:28.160]  tech grid is to absorb us and anesthetize our minds as we're slowly
[1:59:28.160 --> 1:59:33.760]  killed and any future generations that happen to strangle out of their
[1:59:33.760 --> 1:59:39.280]  mother's wounds will be a mere shadow of what humans once were this is the
[1:59:39.280 --> 1:59:44.480]  satanic ruling elite engaged in mass vandalism against God's creation
[1:59:44.480 --> 1:59:48.720]  humanity this is the essence of evil
[1:59:48.720 --> 2:00:08.120]  the mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so
[2:00:08.120 --> 2:00:14.600]  does he lie from the info wars dot com studios it's Alex Jones what a time to

[2:00:39.120 --> 2:00:43.040]  their religion in China this is all a sick evil attack and they believe the
[2:00:43.040 --> 2:00:47.120]  public stupid will accept it not be outraged even if you get outraged and
[2:00:47.120 --> 2:00:52.160]  say no the UN still thinks you'll never do anything about them all right let's
[2:00:52.160 --> 2:00:56.000]  move quickly that last call was amazing we spent five minutes with them let's go
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:01:02.520]  to Doyle in Indiana about the UN and the Dems and their announcements Alex you
[2:01:02.520 --> 2:01:09.200]  are a adjunct corps man of arms at the battle of adjunct corps I can just see
[2:01:09.200 --> 2:01:14.880]  you being a man of arms right at the front but anyway follow the money the
[2:01:14.880 --> 2:01:20.640]  globalists they've invested all over the world anywhere but America in fact they
[2:01:20.640 --> 2:01:27.440]  have harvested this country's economic organs and they need to protect their
[2:01:27.440 --> 2:01:34.080]  fortunes because they know they're gonna lose this election and the globalist
[2:01:34.080 --> 2:01:38.520]  harvested our organs transferred them to China and now Trump somehow has
[2:01:38.520 --> 2:01:42.520]  growing some new ones and they're pissed they're like no no no we get your organs
[2:01:42.520 --> 2:01:45.960]  and you've got to just die and you're over and we beat you but it's not going
[2:01:45.960 --> 2:01:50.480]  that way and then to see all these other Americans teamed up with China and and
[2:01:50.480 --> 2:01:54.880]  the Democrat Party vice president candidate praising China and and laughing
[2:01:54.880 --> 2:01:58.800]  at the vice president I mean they're just open traders where are Americans
[2:01:58.800 --> 2:02:04.880]  instincts well listen I gotta say something else about the Marxist because
[2:02:04.880 --> 2:02:09.720]  the first thing the Marxist said to do and this this is from reading Lenin
[2:02:09.720 --> 2:02:12.600]  state and revolution the first thing you got to do is you got to get ready he
[2:02:12.600 --> 2:02:19.000]  called it bourgeois parliamentarianism and I think Stalin said it up he who
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:23.240]  counts the he who does he who votes decides nothing he who counts the votes
[2:02:23.240 --> 2:02:30.560]  decides everything they've got to ruin the vote to where it's muddied up then
[2:02:30.560 --> 2:02:38.480]  the next step for the is a one-party rule the next step is a standing army and
[2:02:38.480 --> 2:02:46.600]  the standing army is the UN coming in and the final stage of a Bolshevik
[2:02:46.600 --> 2:02:52.120]  takeover is kill millions and I I'm not saying this this is right from Lenin
[2:02:52.120 --> 2:02:57.920]  state and revolution in fact have you ever read state and revolution Alex by
[2:02:57.920 --> 2:03:01.480]  Lenin yes guys please print up Lenin's statement of revolution no that's why
[2:03:01.480 --> 2:03:06.480]  he he said more blood the red terror and that's why the the weathermen when it
[2:03:06.480 --> 2:03:10.480]  came out they plan to kill 25 million Americans but 50 million in slave camps
[2:03:10.480 --> 2:03:15.640]  is that is that that's their religion killing the Christians raping women
[2:03:15.640 --> 2:03:19.840]  enslaving people that's their their goal they want to just get to the killing
[2:03:19.840 --> 2:03:25.400]  the whole point of the authoritarianism is to kill people but it's really scary
[2:03:25.400 --> 2:03:32.160]  still in the election bringing in a standing army IE the UN it's all out of
[2:03:32.160 --> 2:03:40.320]  the open now brother can you believe it I mean it's scary it is scary terrifying
[2:03:40.320 --> 2:03:45.160]  god bless you Doyle what a time to be alive all right let's go ahead and go
[2:03:45.160 --> 2:03:50.640]  to Debbie in New Jersey Debbie you're on the air welcome hey Alex I was told
[2:03:50.640 --> 2:03:56.040]  that there were English-speaking UN mercenaries living in the abandoned
[2:03:56.040 --> 2:03:59.360]  buildings all throughout the United States here have you heard about that
[2:03:59.360 --> 2:04:04.120]  well what they do is they've done lots of training with different governments
[2:04:04.120 --> 2:04:08.840]  under immunization under UN occupations under I4 and other groups and yeah the
[2:04:08.840 --> 2:04:11.520]  UN goes around occupies places all the places they've done drills all over the
[2:04:11.520 --> 2:04:15.760]  country to train local police to accept it when they occupy but really what they
[2:04:15.760 --> 2:04:19.880]  want is agenda 21 strong cities initiative where the cities are already
[2:04:19.880 --> 2:04:24.640]  under UN control via a treaty agreement just like the Australian cities that are
[2:04:24.640 --> 2:04:28.560]  still under martial law they take their orders from the UN big tech takes their
[2:04:28.560 --> 2:04:32.960]  orders from the UN big pharma takes their orders when the president comes out
[2:04:32.960 --> 2:04:37.520]  and says hey this has a lower death rate than the flu they they banned his
[2:04:37.520 --> 2:04:40.320]  tweet saying the United Nations says that's not true even though it is true
[2:04:40.320 --> 2:04:44.400]  so the UN is in pretty much control and that's what I'm saying Bill Gates and the
[2:04:44.400 --> 2:04:48.520]  UN have as much power as our president does he needs to just come out and tell
[2:04:48.520 --> 2:04:53.260]  everybody that say let's take their power back it's it's it's total fraud well
[2:04:53.260 --> 2:04:58.160]  the bikers aren't ruled by them so we'll see who wins that war exactly anyway well
[2:04:58.160 --> 2:05:02.280]  those listen I don't want to give them too much power they got the banks they
[2:05:02.280 --> 2:05:06.240]  got the media but everybody hates that everybody gets it no the people get it
[2:05:06.240 --> 2:05:09.680]  all the globalists are in trouble no matter what they do no one buys their
[2:05:09.680 --> 2:05:15.480]  crap I mean they have UN events all over the country Texas Idaho Ohio Michigan
[2:05:15.480 --> 2:05:19.640]  California where the UN now takes over whole areas and just says we're in
[2:05:19.640 --> 2:05:23.720]  command now yeah well they can kiss ass on that one because they got a fight
[2:05:23.720 --> 2:05:26.960]  coming I could tell you that and you're right the women are gonna be involved I
[2:05:26.960 --> 2:05:32.880]  can tell you that as well and Camelto Harris yeah she was disgusting she had
[2:05:32.880 --> 2:05:36.400]  the demon face on last night did you see more towards the end as she was
[2:05:36.400 --> 2:05:40.080]  staring at Pence you could actually see the demon coming out through the eyes
[2:05:40.080 --> 2:05:43.920]  did you notice that as well I mean she looks like a total fraud would you buy a
[2:05:43.920 --> 2:05:48.280]  car from her would you be friends with her no she's totally disingenuous you
[2:05:48.280 --> 2:05:52.160]  can't even get close to that energy that's how disgusting she is I felt it
[2:05:52.160 --> 2:05:57.960]  through the TV I was like oh my god look at that face well just not as the
[2:05:57.960 --> 2:06:02.160]  establishment loves her yeah and what does that tell you about him you know
[2:06:02.160 --> 2:06:05.920]  yeah she was she was making Peter's truck faces that bless you thank you so
[2:06:05.920 --> 2:06:11.160]  much Debbie all right let's go ahead and talk to David in California go ahead
[2:06:11.160 --> 2:06:18.840]  David Alex good to talk to you thank you all right so I'm just real quickly I
[2:06:18.840 --> 2:06:24.560]  think you're hitting that you're hitting it right on the head it's important not
[2:06:24.560 --> 2:06:28.200]  to focus on the useful idiots because they'll be the first to be out in this
[2:06:28.200 --> 2:06:33.000]  whole thing but Kamala Harris basically said it best yesterday and she said
[2:06:33.000 --> 2:06:37.160]  that you know she mentioned the trade war and if you're anyone that's paying
[2:06:37.160 --> 2:06:41.360]  attention I mean I this kind of hit me as soon as this whole COVID thing went
[2:06:41.360 --> 2:06:44.960]  down we were in the in the whole trade war the moment Trump leveled the playing
[2:06:44.960 --> 2:06:50.120]  field and so miraculously and all of a sudden China you know deals with the
[2:06:50.120 --> 2:06:54.760]  whole COVID shuts them down for a small amount of time and next you know the
[2:06:54.760 --> 2:06:58.640]  entire the entire world shut down you know a lot longer than China has been so
[2:06:58.640 --> 2:07:01.800]  the end game here ultimately despite all this division and everything that's
[2:07:01.800 --> 2:07:06.320]  happening here is is this whole war with China and our and our then being our
[2:07:06.320 --> 2:07:09.840]  ultimate adversary and enemy of this point but it's gonna be like you said
[2:07:09.840 --> 2:07:15.400]  through the UN so it's important that we realize that and there are like I said
[2:07:15.400 --> 2:07:20.000]  they've already laid their plans on as far as the debate last night the Kamala
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:24.920]  Harris just completely you know stepping and burn herself so I just really
[2:07:24.920 --> 2:07:29.120]  commend you for for for continuing to have brother please don't commend me for
[2:07:29.120 --> 2:07:31.960]  not want to be a slave of the chai comms the globalist don't I hear you we just
[2:07:31.960 --> 2:07:35.360]  want survival but you're absolutely right we're in a war with China and here's
[2:07:35.360 --> 2:07:39.560]  the key we're in a war with China and their sponsors the globalist and that's
[2:07:39.560 --> 2:07:42.880]  why they're all the rich people the middleman Trump talked about in that
[2:07:42.880 --> 2:07:47.400]  world pool speech he gave a few months ago he said hey I'm cutting out the
[2:07:47.400 --> 2:07:50.960]  middleman China's not even the problem there's all these rich middlemen that
[2:07:50.960 --> 2:07:55.880]  set up China to rip us off I'm cutting them out Xi should be happy I'm
[2:07:55.880 --> 2:07:59.560]  actually giving him a deal a little bit better so Trump's like hey Xi we'll give
[2:07:59.560 --> 2:08:02.760]  your actual workers a little more and you a little more I'm cutting out the
[2:08:02.760 --> 2:08:07.640]  ruling elite you understand that's why Trump sees it needs to stop it if you
[2:08:07.640 --> 2:08:10.760]  actually cared about his people Trump's like you'll still get your deals dude
[2:08:10.760 --> 2:08:15.280]  we'll still trade with you but we're not gonna have middlemen where we buy say
[2:08:15.280 --> 2:08:19.480]  this drug for a hundred bucks from you and the middlemen add $300 more on it
[2:08:19.480 --> 2:08:24.080]  it's not happening that's what Trump's doing and that's why they're pissed banking
[2:08:24.080 --> 2:08:28.480]  on the the you know the brown people the code people of this country to get on
[2:08:28.480 --> 2:08:32.280]  their side what they don't understand is there's a lot of red blooded Americans
[2:08:32.280 --> 2:08:36.400]  and I say Americans they're in this country that it came from different parts
[2:08:36.400 --> 2:08:40.600]  of the world they may still have you know half half Latino half African
[2:08:40.600 --> 2:08:44.280]  American at deep down note that the number one part they're American so
[2:08:44.280 --> 2:08:48.560]  they're not gonna they don't they don't realize that they're not totally great
[2:08:48.560 --> 2:08:52.000]  plus I mean here's the deep it's not like America has problems but we're gonna
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:55.600]  have the chai com globalist be our bosses I mean if you folks if you think
[2:08:55.600 --> 2:08:58.520]  America's got problems you wait till we're fully in a new world order you're

[2:10:53.520 --> 2:10:59.000]  world leader the Antichrist and he has a beast system that no one can buy and or

[2:11:21.600 --> 2:11:25.320]  slave but now you look at Bill Gates you look at Bloomberg and others who
[2:11:25.320 --> 2:11:30.360]  openly say we're technocrats we should decide how much salt you get how much
[2:11:30.360 --> 2:11:34.920]  alcohol you get how much red meat you get we're technocrats we know best we're
[2:11:34.920 --> 2:11:38.320]  now going to set up the economy with a social score to totally control you you

[2:12:37.280 --> 2:12:42.880]  getting millions of views a day and giving really insightful but also entertaining commentary. So
[2:12:42.880 --> 2:12:47.120]  I'm going to try for the three segments we have. I really appreciate you coming on as busy guys.
[2:12:47.120 --> 2:12:52.640]  The audience just loves you. I've loved you for years to talk about the debate last night and
[2:12:52.640 --> 2:12:57.040]  then also all the other crazy things that are happening what's front and center on your radar.
[2:12:57.040 --> 2:13:02.240]  So great to have both you gentlemen. Thank you for having us but Vice President Pence,
[2:13:02.240 --> 2:13:07.280]  he mopped the floor with that woman. Yeah, that man is very sharp. I hadn't before that debate.
[2:13:07.280 --> 2:13:11.440]  I heard him speak but not the way he spoke last night. That was amazing. He's an awesome Vice
[2:13:11.440 --> 2:13:19.920]  President. Hey Alex, that was a political debate lynching pun intended. Well, he certainly he
[2:13:19.920 --> 2:13:25.040]  certainly was like a tactician. It was like an NFL player playing a high school player and he ran over
[2:13:25.040 --> 2:13:30.880]  her. Yeah, I mean, she's a total fraud. The only reason why she's in that position because they
[2:13:30.880 --> 2:13:36.240]  wanted a black woman. Yeah, and it shows she's totally unqualified for that position. She sucks.
[2:13:36.240 --> 2:13:42.720]  Yeah, and Mike Pence man. The whole what makes a good debater is a person who's well
[2:13:43.600 --> 2:13:48.720]  a person that can control his emotions. He was in control of his emotions entire night and on
[2:13:48.720 --> 2:13:53.920]  the on his left or his right Kamala Harris who's totally emotional. He came off real condescending
[2:13:53.920 --> 2:14:01.840]  snobby. Yeah, nothing worse than a snobby woman. And she also kept contradicting herself. Now,
[2:14:01.840 --> 2:14:09.360]  I would give Pence and telemundo did a 7677. They removed that poll and 76% of Hispanics thought he
[2:14:09.360 --> 2:14:13.920]  won. 66% thought Trump won. I think he did a better job than Trump. But here's the difference.
[2:14:14.960 --> 2:14:19.360]  The moderators were not interrupting a tenth as much as happened Chris Wallace.
[2:14:20.320 --> 2:14:24.880]  Right, right. Yeah, I thought the moderator last night she did a decent job. She let them go
[2:14:25.760 --> 2:14:30.960]  go at each other. That's where a debate should be. Yeah. Chris Wallace is definitely one sided.
[2:14:30.960 --> 2:14:34.800]  Didn't give him much time to debate and go after one another. Last night,
[2:14:34.800 --> 2:14:38.480]  then she gave a lot more leeway. They was actually able to, you know, debate each other. Yeah.
[2:14:39.200 --> 2:14:44.400]  What did you think the most amazing point by either person both good or bad was in the debate?
[2:14:44.400 --> 2:14:49.280]  What was the what parts stand out to you? So the one thing that stands out to me,
[2:14:49.280 --> 2:14:55.840]  she keeps politicizing COVID-19, the Chinese virus, and she keeps exploiting 200,000 deaths,
[2:14:55.840 --> 2:15:01.520]  blaming Trump for it. When she was asked what they would do if they win the presidency, what they
[2:15:01.520 --> 2:15:06.480]  would do differently. She sat there and repeated exactly what this administration is currently
[2:15:06.480 --> 2:15:10.960]  doing, testing and tracing. What would you have done different? You keep blaming this man for
[2:15:10.960 --> 2:15:15.600]  all these deaths and you're going to sit here and do the exact same thing. Right. I mean,
[2:15:15.600 --> 2:15:20.400]  it's disingenuous. I surprised that people on the left are not catching on to what this
[2:15:20.400 --> 2:15:23.920]  this woman's a fraud. They have no ideas. They have no plans.
[2:15:23.920 --> 2:15:28.960]  Biden and Obama, they prove what they're going to do. If we have a Joe Biden and a Kamala Harris
[2:15:28.960 --> 2:15:32.640]  presidency, we already know what they're all about. When we had the swan flu in this country,
[2:15:32.640 --> 2:15:36.880]  I think three times as many people contracted disease. Thank God that disease went as deadly
[2:15:36.880 --> 2:15:41.840]  as the COVID-19. They wouldn't do anything different. They even put down the fact that
[2:15:41.840 --> 2:15:46.080]  they didn't even give they're not willing to give our president any credit at all for shutting down
[2:15:46.080 --> 2:15:51.360]  travel from China. Yeah, that wasn't good enough. They keep harping on this mask when
[2:15:51.360 --> 2:15:56.560]  Fauci, Dr. Fauci said masks don't work. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he's been following the scientists.
[2:15:56.560 --> 2:16:00.560]  Yeah. Trump's not coming up with these ideas. He's listening to his scientists.
[2:16:00.560 --> 2:16:05.840]  Right. But y'all blaming Trump for the 20,000 deaths. And it's a global pandemic over,
[2:16:05.840 --> 2:16:10.800]  I think it's over two million worldwide is worldwide has died from this virus.
[2:16:10.800 --> 2:16:15.200]  And the Democrats want to blame our president. The only person that's to blame is China,
[2:16:15.200 --> 2:16:21.520]  communist China. Yeah. And they even admit that they were working on weaponized coronaviruses
[2:16:21.520 --> 2:16:26.480]  at that laboratory. But if you try to talk about it, big tech sensors, have you seen the New York
[2:16:26.480 --> 2:16:31.280]  Times come out and say they're going to have the UN try to oversee our election, they're calling for
[2:16:31.280 --> 2:16:35.680]  the UN to oversee Trump and that the Democrats are going to contest the election. This is this is
[2:16:35.680 --> 2:16:40.880]  crazy. Yeah, I heard some rummins. Yeah, I heard some rummins about that. That is insane. I don't
[2:16:40.880 --> 2:16:46.960]  want nothing to do with the UN. Right. Keep America in charge of our elections. They won't
[2:16:46.960 --> 2:16:52.640]  even let Trump send federal agents to disperse these riots and these these clowns destroying
[2:16:52.640 --> 2:16:57.040]  people's property. Yeah. But they want the UN to come in and oversee our elections. That doesn't
[2:16:57.040 --> 2:17:02.720]  that's like hypocrisy at its finest. You're gonna let the UN take control of this country
[2:17:02.720 --> 2:17:06.960]  when you're not even let the president take control of these riots in this country. Yeah.
[2:17:06.960 --> 2:17:13.600]  Yeah. That is a great angle up. For me, the biggest lie was her repeatedly saying we are
[2:17:13.600 --> 2:17:20.240]  not for banning fracking when she says it as part of their actual platform before and Biden said,
[2:17:20.240 --> 2:17:25.360]  I guarantee you we will abolish fossil fuels. So here's what Biden one of the clips he had to say
[2:17:25.360 --> 2:17:30.560]  and then what happened last night back to back. My family lives in western Pennsylvania where
[2:17:30.560 --> 2:17:36.560]  fracked gas wells have become a common site. Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking
[2:17:36.560 --> 2:17:45.120]  your first day in office? There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. Please. Okay.
[2:17:46.960 --> 2:17:51.360]  Joe Biden will not raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. He has been
[2:17:51.360 --> 2:17:56.000]  very clear about that. Joe Biden will not end fracking. He has been very clear about that.
[2:17:57.760 --> 2:18:04.080]  Joe Biden is the one who during the the great recession was responsible
[2:18:04.080 --> 2:18:09.680]  for the recovery. I'm not even going to play the clip where Joe Biden walks up and says,
[2:18:09.680 --> 2:18:14.480]  I guarantee you we will ban fossil fuels. I mean, it can see worse. How do you tell Whoppers when
[2:18:14.480 --> 2:18:18.160]  Pence knows he's got the campaign to have the destroyer? Why the hell would you tell? I like
[2:18:18.160 --> 2:18:21.520]  that. It'd be like if you were saying, I'm not wearing a red shirt or I'm not wearing a blue
[2:18:21.520 --> 2:18:26.880]  jacket. I mean, everybody can see we are. What is this? Well, you know, Alex, a person that tells
[2:18:26.880 --> 2:18:31.440]  a lot of lies, they can keep control, they can, they can tell a lot of lies, but they can't keep
[2:18:31.440 --> 2:18:37.680]  account of how many lies they told. They get lost to that lie. I mean, I mean, you on tape saying
[2:18:37.680 --> 2:18:42.880]  this repeatedly and about the taxes, you're going to raise everybody's taxes during the global
[2:18:42.880 --> 2:18:48.320]  pandemic. The economy is in shambles and you're going to over tax businesses now. That's going
[2:18:48.320 --> 2:18:52.480]  to ruin job growth and you're going to take money out of people's pockets right now. And you know
[2:18:52.480 --> 2:18:56.800]  what the crazy thing is. She says she's not going to, she's going to do away to tax cuts, but she's
[2:18:56.800 --> 2:19:02.320]  not going to raise the taxes of the common American. She wants to give free education. Yeah. How the
[2:19:02.320 --> 2:19:08.560]  hell you going to do that? That magic wand Obama said he's got. I mean, these people free education
[2:19:08.560 --> 2:19:13.120]  that's these professors, teachers, they're not working for free. The books cost my electricity.
[2:19:13.120 --> 2:19:17.840]  I mean, there's cost to everything. Right. And all the lawsuits that left us file, that's what's
[2:19:17.840 --> 2:19:22.480]  bankrupting healthcare, bankrupting education. I was reading like a out of 10 lawsuits are
[2:19:22.480 --> 2:19:28.240]  filed by Democrats. Everybody knows that they sue everybody. Yeah. I mean, look at them. If
[2:19:29.840 --> 2:19:34.880]  Amy Barrett, she gets in and they wouldn't, the presidency, they're going to pack the court.
[2:19:34.880 --> 2:19:39.920]  It's like they, they don't like the rules. If they win, they like the rules, but if they don't win,
[2:19:39.920 --> 2:19:44.080]  they want to change the rules. Yeah. I mean, they behave like kids. I didn't want to deal with the
[2:19:44.080 --> 2:19:48.240]  Electoral College because they didn't want an election when it was perfectly fine when Obama
[2:19:48.240 --> 2:19:54.560]  won the election. Yeah. You just said it. They behave like petulant children. Right. Yeah.
[2:19:55.440 --> 2:20:00.080]  These people, they, I mean, they fit that same description. They're very emotional. They don't
[2:20:00.080 --> 2:20:04.560]  think they think with their hearts. Yeah. When you see, when you sit down and talk to a conservative
[2:20:04.560 --> 2:20:10.160]  or Republican or somebody on the left, they all are the same way. They don't think it is too emotional
[2:20:10.160 --> 2:20:14.960]  sit down and take and grasp what's going on or think with their brain. Yeah. I want to ask you
[2:20:14.960 --> 2:20:18.880]  this question. What do you expect is going to happen when they do contest the election
[2:20:18.880 --> 2:20:23.360]  and try to start a race for them? They admit that the UN says, oh, America's racist. China says it's
[2:20:23.360 --> 2:20:28.400]  bad. We need the UN to come in to oversee the election and decide who wins and America's historically
[2:20:28.400 --> 2:20:33.360]  bad. When China literally has slave camps with Christians, Buddhists and Muslims in them and
[2:20:33.360 --> 2:20:37.040]  millions and nobody says a damn thing about religious discrimination. It's just crazy.
[2:20:37.040 --> 2:20:41.600]  The Hodge twins are here. They're kicking butt. We love having them. Hodge twins everywhere. Check
[2:20:41.600 --> 2:20:47.440]  it out. Official Hodge twins website as well. Remember the global lock down for witnessing
[2:20:47.440 --> 2:20:53.920]  the black lives matter. Antifa riots and racial attacks we're all seeing are publicly directed
[2:20:53.920 --> 2:21:01.600]  by a handful of top billionaires led by people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, of course, Tim Cook and
[2:21:01.600 --> 2:21:07.920]  others. They set up there with their trillions of dollars they control in their companies and
[2:21:07.920 --> 2:21:13.680]  are hundreds of billions of dollars individually leveraging that against us and trying to create
[2:21:13.680 --> 2:21:19.680]  an artificial revolution against local government and police. And the mayors are again there playing
[2:21:19.680 --> 2:21:25.040]  their political game to try to trigger the complete breakdown of the United States and Western Europe
[2:21:25.040 --> 2:21:29.760]  show these billionaires can come in and buy it all up for billions on the dollar. That's why I'm so
[2:21:29.760 --> 2:21:33.520]  angry at these globalists because when you're looking at them, they're the ones that sit in
[2:21:33.520 --> 2:21:39.760]  their councils and have decided to run these plans against us. They are enemies of humanity and must
[2:21:39.760 --> 2:21:47.200]  be dealt with. It's us or them, period. For more than a hundred years, the Rockefeller Foundation
[2:21:47.200 --> 2:21:52.720]  has worked to establish world government, abolish nation states, dumb down the population by taking
[2:21:52.720 --> 2:21:58.480]  control of education, and most importantly taking control of Western medicine. Now they had a bad
[2:21:58.480 --> 2:22:04.960]  name by the 1920s. They started converting over and funding other organizations and groups like IBM
[2:22:04.960 --> 2:22:11.840]  to continue on with their eugenics operations. Fast forward to the 1980s, the baton is handed
[2:22:11.840 --> 2:22:17.760]  by IBM via his mother on the board of directors to Bill Gates III, his father, of course, being
[2:22:17.760 --> 2:22:23.840]  at a planned parenthood. And now he's been able to position himself over almost every health department
[2:22:23.840 --> 2:22:30.880]  in the world, every national health system. Bill Gates is in control. They have spent a hundred
[2:22:30.880 --> 2:22:36.400]  plus years getting positioned to be able to control what happens to your body and what goes in your
[2:22:36.400 --> 2:22:42.240]  body. This is the holy grail of their operations and now they're normalizing putting a new type of
[2:22:42.240 --> 2:22:49.440]  DNA in your body. 2020ElectionCenter.com. Just type it in one time. You've got to save right
[2:22:49.440 --> 2:22:55.360]  there in your browser. And then you can share it on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Apple platforms,
[2:22:55.360 --> 2:23:01.600]  but most importantly via text message, email, or by word of mouth because they have banned
[2:23:02.240 --> 2:23:09.440]  the links to banned.video. 2020ElectionCenter.com is a clone of the site of the exact same links,
[2:23:09.440 --> 2:23:16.240]  the exact same videos. We can comment and share them everything. The system is censoring because
[2:23:16.240 --> 2:23:20.800]  of the power of the people overrode them four years ago. Trump has finally figured this out
[2:23:20.800 --> 2:23:24.880]  since he's going to take action once reelected against big tech. I mean, he's modern in the
[2:23:24.880 --> 2:23:28.640]  situation. Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and cry
[2:23:28.640 --> 2:23:32.800]  because he has to take an action. We the people are taking action now and you can do it very,
[2:23:32.800 --> 2:23:37.360]  very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com, 2020ElectionCenter.com, and checking out the
[2:23:37.360 --> 2:23:49.440]  new redesigned infomores.com and sharing that link. Oh, that really upsets them. Oh, yeah.
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:20.480]  25 days out. 25 days out, but there's a lot more than that. Then there's 79 days after that
[2:24:20.480 --> 2:24:27.120]  where the deep state, Chinese sponsored globalist communist democratic party are openly going to
[2:24:27.120 --> 2:24:32.240]  try to have secession and the breakup of the nation and using race war as the cover for it.
[2:24:32.240 --> 2:24:37.920]  That's officially in the New York Times yesterday. So I asked my guest, what do you want to get to
[2:24:37.920 --> 2:24:42.480]  next? We'll get back into the debate and some of the incredible things that happened there and
[2:24:43.040 --> 2:24:48.400]  their whole discussions overpacking the court. But I think what you're saying, Hodge Twins,
[2:24:49.280 --> 2:24:53.600]  is front and center. The real America has never been more together, never been getting along,
[2:24:53.600 --> 2:24:57.680]  that have never been more integrated and happy from my own personal life and experience.
[2:24:57.680 --> 2:25:01.760]  But if you tune into the media or you go to a college or a leftist area,
[2:25:01.760 --> 2:25:06.240]  everybody's freaked out. The colleges are resegregating people according to race so they
[2:25:06.240 --> 2:25:12.960]  can brainwash both groups, teach people to hate each other. This is so sick. What do you think
[2:25:12.960 --> 2:25:20.000]  they're planning? What do you see unfolding in 25 days? Man, I mean, they're trying to divide
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:23.840]  this country. I think you said it best. They're actually teaching us to hate each other based
[2:25:23.840 --> 2:25:28.560]  on our skin color. It's like, I don't know how many times I'm cutting on YouTube and I see these
[2:25:28.560 --> 2:25:32.400]  clips because they're not showing this on the news. You see white people being attacked for being
[2:25:32.400 --> 2:25:36.960]  white. Just getting that ass whooped for being white. Yeah. Well, being a Trump support, I mean,
[2:25:38.880 --> 2:25:42.320]  people saying we're going to have a race war. We're already in a race war. Yeah, it's already
[2:25:42.320 --> 2:25:47.360]  starting. It's just, it's going to be some event that's going to put it in the forefront. I've
[2:25:47.360 --> 2:25:52.000]  seen an old white guy, elderly guy in the 60s, and this kid just runs up and hits him in the back
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:56.240]  of the head with a brick and knocks him out cold. Yeah. And I've seen these whites getting jumped
[2:25:56.240 --> 2:26:00.320]  by multiple blacks and nobody's calling for what it is. It's a hate crime. Yeah. Old white
[2:26:00.320 --> 2:26:04.240]  couples sitting down just eating at a restaurant and black lives matter come up and start drinking
[2:26:04.240 --> 2:26:09.200]  from their cups. Yeah. Oh, that's coming. I don't know why they want a race war because we're out
[2:26:09.200 --> 2:26:13.520]  numbered. Yeah. I tell you what, if a race war do start, I'm paying myself white. Yeah, I'm going
[2:26:13.520 --> 2:26:19.200]  in white. White people got the numbers. What do you want a race war in this country? I can see if
[2:26:19.200 --> 2:26:23.920]  you wanted one in Africa. You know what, Alex? These black people think they in a movie, Sparta.
[2:26:24.480 --> 2:26:28.560]  They think they're in a movie 300. No, that's just in the movies. You ain't going to fight
[2:26:28.560 --> 2:26:33.040]  off thousands of hundreds of thousands of people defending themselves. And white people are just
[2:26:33.040 --> 2:26:37.120]  being, I think white people are being taken advantage of. Yeah. Because I see with black
[2:26:37.120 --> 2:26:41.040]  lives matter, there's a lot of white people out there doing damage to and they actually
[2:26:41.680 --> 2:26:47.280]  hate their own race. Oh, yeah. It's white. It's weird. Oh, white academics that are leading it.
[2:26:47.280 --> 2:26:54.000]  Yeah. And white people falling for this. I'm like, it's nothing wrong with being white. Yeah.
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:58.880]  You know, and it's like, and another thing, man, Joe Biden during his debate said Antifa is an
[2:26:58.880 --> 2:27:04.640]  ideal and they keep calling this as a myth while they're burning down inner cities and black people
[2:27:04.640 --> 2:27:09.040]  in their neighborhoods and Democrats are letting them do it. That's your neighborhood. That is not
[2:27:09.040 --> 2:27:13.360]  a myth. Antifa, that's not a myth. Those are the same people that's handing out bricks and
[2:27:13.360 --> 2:27:17.360]  handing out tools for people to tear down their own neighborhoods. Well, by the way, there's nothing
[2:27:17.360 --> 2:27:24.480]  on tape of Trump saying the type of cliches that Joe Biden says, I never knew a lot of old racist
[2:27:24.480 --> 2:27:27.920]  white people when I knew some. And that's exactly what they sounded like. Joe Biden,
[2:27:28.560 --> 2:27:33.680]  Trump's, I mean, so ridiculous how obvious it is that Joe Biden passed all those laws to give
[2:27:33.680 --> 2:27:40.000]  black people bigger prison sentences. Right. I mean, what was that? The KKK members in the
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:45.680]  center for like 50 years. Robert Byrd. I mean, he spoke at his friend. He disavowed the Klan, but
[2:27:46.400 --> 2:27:50.640]  okay, let's look at this. This dude was in the Klan. He was a recruiter for the Klan. This dude
[2:27:50.640 --> 2:27:57.360]  was going to malls, going up to white people's aid. Hey, boy, wanna join the Klan? That's what
[2:27:57.360 --> 2:28:02.640]  Robert Byrd did. That's what he did. And Joe Biden, he's worked closely with segregationists.
[2:28:02.640 --> 2:28:08.000]  I mean, and they continue to want Trump to denounce the KKK. The only person that has
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:12.880]  any affiliation with the KKK is Joe Biden. I agree. Joe Biden, they should be saying,
[2:28:12.880 --> 2:28:17.120]  denounce the KKK because you eulogize the Grand Wizard or whatever the hell he was.
[2:28:17.840 --> 2:28:23.520]  Yeah, dude was a recruiter for the Klan. Like just in the clay, he was refuting too.
[2:28:24.400 --> 2:28:27.280]  I think he was one of the leaders in his state, like a wizard or something.
[2:28:28.400 --> 2:28:32.880]  Yeah. I don't think he was a wizard. Yeah. What I checked that it's on Calvin,
[2:28:32.880 --> 2:28:37.120]  whatever the hell they had this on. It sounds like Dungeons and Dragons. He had like a,
[2:28:37.120 --> 2:28:44.480]  yeah, he had a clan bird. That's what his book said. And the dude was a recruiter. Yeah. I mean,
[2:28:45.520 --> 2:28:51.520]  and but Trump has to disavow the clan and he's done it repeatedly. I'm sorry. He was an exalted
[2:28:51.520 --> 2:28:59.520]  Cyclops. Yeah, what the hell is a Cyclops? I'm sorry. That sounds high up there. That's like the
[2:28:59.520 --> 2:29:09.200]  Pope of the KKK. Exalted Cyclops. Oh my God. You can't make this up. Yeah, it's crazy, but
[2:29:09.200 --> 2:29:13.520]  something with the Communist Chinese or something like you got dragons, you got wizards,
[2:29:13.520 --> 2:29:16.320]  you got Cyclops. This is like Game of Thrones.
[2:29:20.320 --> 2:29:26.640]  I'm sorry. It's not a laughing matter. Right. Sometimes you got to laugh these things as,
[2:29:26.640 --> 2:29:31.360]  you know, it makes it, you know, you got to know what gets you through tough times like this,
[2:29:31.360 --> 2:29:36.720]  times that don't make a lot of senses. Sometimes it just have a laugh, man, make a joke. And,
[2:29:36.720 --> 2:29:42.560]  you know, us on the right in the service of Republicans, we like to joke and have fun,
[2:29:42.560 --> 2:29:46.800]  but these people on the left, they lost their sense of humor. You say a certain joke,
[2:29:46.800 --> 2:29:51.840]  they get offended. It's like nobody can. No, I agree. Let's take the proud boys. That's always
[2:29:51.840 --> 2:29:55.040]  been a group about being proud to be male, proud to be Western. If you're part of what they say,
[2:29:55.040 --> 2:30:00.240]  or white supremacy that they say, call written houses. I mean, imagine if we organized a group
[2:30:00.240 --> 2:30:05.120]  that was openly for all races and groups, but we had like, well, you're a, you're a unicorn and you're
[2:30:05.120 --> 2:30:12.400]  a, you're a jolly green giant. I mean, this is crazy. Right. You're the exotic Cyclops. Exalted.
[2:30:13.200 --> 2:30:15.520]  So what do you think of proud boys? I think they've really been screwed over.
[2:30:16.320 --> 2:30:22.000]  Oh yeah. I've met many of them. They came to my shows. Yeah. They stood in my meet and greet
[2:30:22.000 --> 2:30:26.880]  lines. They paid hundreds of dollars to see me and buy my shirts. These people are not racist.
[2:30:26.880 --> 2:30:33.920]  Yeah. One of them has called me the n-word after my show. These are good people that are straight.
[2:30:33.920 --> 2:30:37.440]  They are conservative and they're just proud of their heritage as being American. Yeah,
[2:30:37.440 --> 2:30:41.600]  they're more and they come from all races. Yeah. It's not just white people. That shows
[2:30:41.600 --> 2:30:47.520]  you what scares them is a bunch of men together. They want us divided. But look how far they've
[2:30:47.520 --> 2:30:53.200]  taken that. The proud boys is a white supremacist group. The media is the most powerful organization
[2:30:53.200 --> 2:30:57.120]  in this country. And Malcolm X called this in the 60s. They can make the guilty look innocent
[2:30:57.120 --> 2:31:01.840]  and the innocent look guilty. They've got these people looking like they're white supremacists.
[2:31:01.840 --> 2:31:06.160]  Yeah. And look at what the Hollywood has been doing ever since after the Joe Biden debate.
[2:31:06.800 --> 2:31:11.520]  You got, you got celebrities, huge celebs, Kevin Hart sprayed misinformation. Oh,
[2:31:11.520 --> 2:31:17.040]  the president is told the KKK to stand back. No, he did not. It was a one into the proud boys
[2:31:17.040 --> 2:31:21.600]  because they knew the media was going to make them look like the bad guys. Yeah. And they're
[2:31:21.600 --> 2:31:25.600]  taking things way out of context. And it's like, I know Kevin Hart and I know these people in
[2:31:25.600 --> 2:31:29.680]  Hollywood, they can't be this stupid. They can't be. You can't be that stupid. You can't be that
[2:31:29.680 --> 2:31:34.960]  successful in life. You can't be that great. You cannot be a great comedian, a great business person
[2:31:35.760 --> 2:31:40.880]  knowing that these people are not spreading this, or spreading this misinformation. You can't be
[2:31:40.880 --> 2:31:47.120]  that stupid. You can't be that dumb. Yeah. Well, it's like the rock. I really liked Dwayne Johnson, but
[2:31:47.120 --> 2:31:51.120]  he said he was Republican. He came out and endorsed Biden. These people are all owned by
[2:31:51.120 --> 2:31:58.000]  Hollywood. They're being ordered to do this. They're puppets. Yeah. Sellouts. Clowns. Yeah. That's
[2:31:58.000 --> 2:32:01.360]  what they are. Actually, what they're doing is audition for the next movie roles. Yeah. All
[2:32:01.360 --> 2:32:06.800]  they're doing. If they don't remain puppets, they will lose a lot of leeway in Hollywood. Yeah.
[2:32:06.800 --> 2:32:11.040]  That's why they forced Kevin Hart to make that apology after something he said it was homophobic
[2:32:11.040 --> 2:32:15.520]  over a decade ago. Yeah. There's just, there was flex on them. Hey, I'm just letting you know,
[2:32:15.520 --> 2:32:20.000]  hey, if you don't stay in line with us, your career is over. That's why he did that to Kevin
[2:32:20.000 --> 2:32:24.880]  Hart. And he bowed down to the mob. Yeah. The problem with bending over is you got to do it
[2:32:24.880 --> 2:32:29.600]  every time they snap their fingers. Yeah. Once you've been over once, you're going to bend over
[2:32:29.600 --> 2:32:34.480]  every week. It gets easier and easier. Every time bubble comes in your cell, say it's time. You start
[2:32:34.480 --> 2:32:39.760]  to like it. Rough. Yeah. You start to like men. Bubba's taking real good care of me. Don't even
[2:32:39.760 --> 2:32:46.400]  hurt anymore. The rock like bends over to Steven Spielberg. Let's don't call him the rock. He's
[2:32:46.400 --> 2:32:52.400]  the pebble now. Yeah. All right. We're going to go to break. Take a few calls. Josh, Bob, Pete,
[2:32:52.400 --> 2:32:56.640]  Mike and Steve want to talk to all of us. We got the hodge twins here with us. They're kicking

[2:34:49.040 --> 2:34:56.800]  corporate governance above nation states, above religious institutions, above the family. They
[2:34:56.800 --> 2:35:03.040]  want total corporate power. There was a great film back in the early 1970s called rollerball with
[2:35:03.040 --> 2:35:11.360]  James Kahn. It's based on a novel set in the year 2020. And in the book, you have mega corporations
[2:35:11.360 --> 2:35:17.760]  that control the planet. There are no longer nation states. There are only cities that are the
[2:35:17.760 --> 2:35:23.440]  capitals of the corporations. If you actually read what the most group of the CFR to lateral
[2:35:23.440 --> 2:35:29.520]  commission say in the year 2020, that is their in game. That is their goal. So we're talking about
[2:35:29.520 --> 2:35:36.160]  a hunger games type scenario here run by very, very, very ruthless people to see us as shadow.
[2:35:36.160 --> 2:35:41.440]  They're using COVID-19 as their takeover strategy. The Communist China has their model. We must reject
[2:35:41.440 --> 2:35:51.120]  it now. And perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications of COVID-19,
[2:35:51.120 --> 2:35:59.760]  which are well beyond what they should be, it's estimated that 200 million people have died.
[2:35:59.760 --> 2:36:06.000]  Probably by the time I finish this talk, Joe Biden has always been a congenital liar.
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:13.280]  Part of the establishment for close to 50 years. But now, boy, as his brain degenerates, we are
[2:36:13.280 --> 2:36:20.000]  seeing walking public dementia on the biggest stage in the world, the 2020 election. There are
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:26.160]  370 million people in the United States. If 200 million died from COVID, that'd be more than half
[2:36:26.160 --> 2:36:32.000]  of the population, when not even one tenth of 1% have actually died. But him putting these giant
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:37.520]  lies and these incredibly brain damage statements out is emblematic of the general public being
[2:36:37.520 --> 2:36:44.880]  in a trance. How is anyone even putting up with this? It is beyond bizarre. The future isn't coming,
[2:36:44.880 --> 2:36:52.000]  it's here. And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity,
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:57.280]  your very essence, is going to be your most valuable asset. In fact, it's going to be your
[2:36:57.280 --> 2:37:03.360]  only asset. The world being built by the technocrats. And the trap they've now sprung
[2:37:03.360 --> 2:37:09.360]  with COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning of the process of taking us past
[2:37:09.360 --> 2:37:18.080]  domestication into total and complete dehumanization. Human life will be impossible to be carried out
[2:37:18.800 --> 2:37:26.160]  in an original biological way by the year 2050. This is their stated goal. I'm sorry to have to
[2:37:26.160 --> 2:37:32.080]  report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror and not projecting
[2:37:32.080 --> 2:37:36.960]  your own decency onto the enemy, can we turn this around. You must study their own writings,
[2:37:36.960 --> 2:37:42.640]  you must face the facts, and you must come to grips with it. You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[2:38:07.920 --> 2:38:18.960]  I'm going to host the fourth hour with an original founder of the Black Panther Party
[2:38:18.960 --> 2:38:24.320]  and one of the best orators I know, Larry Pinkney, who's been on fire for a long time,
[2:38:24.320 --> 2:38:28.560]  but particularly exposing the left to what's really going on, not to be associated with
[2:38:28.560 --> 2:38:33.360]  a new Black Panther Party that's under Soros funded group. We're going to take a few phone calls,
[2:38:33.360 --> 2:38:38.240]  Josh, Bob, Pete, Mike, and Steve have been holding here with the Hodge Twins to talk about the election,
[2:38:38.800 --> 2:38:44.880]  but 25th amendment, Pelosi already said we're going to fumigate him, even if he says he wins,
[2:38:44.880 --> 2:38:48.800]  we'll have an inauguration somewhere else. Podesta was in the New York Times wargaming,
[2:38:48.800 --> 2:38:53.600]  at a wargame that the New York Times was on the line with two months ago saying we're going to
[2:38:53.600 --> 2:38:57.360]  have the states to see, we're going to contest when we lose, we're going to bring the UN in,
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:01.120]  give the US military, it won't come in. Well, now the New York Times called for the US military
[2:39:01.120 --> 2:39:05.200]  to be brought in. We were just covering that, but here's the new video. She just tweeted this,
[2:39:05.200 --> 2:39:11.040]  tomorrow, by the way, tomorrow, come here tomorrow, we're going to be talking about the 25th amendment
[2:39:11.040 --> 2:39:16.160]  to remove the president saying he's mentally ill. So they're getting ready to make their move,
[2:39:16.160 --> 2:39:20.560]  look who's mentally ill up here with that damn mask and all the crazy stuff they're doing. Let's
[2:39:20.560 --> 2:39:28.320]  roll with this witch, I had to say. When we hear people saying I'm young and I'm a perfect specimen
[2:39:28.320 --> 2:39:38.240]  instead of addressing the fact that what 50,000 people reported to be infected yesterday, nearly
[2:39:38.240 --> 2:39:47.120]  1,000 people died. What are we talking about here? Tomorrow, by the way, tomorrow, come here tomorrow,
[2:39:47.120 --> 2:39:52.080]  we're going to be talking about the 25th amendment, but not to take attention away from the subject
[2:39:52.080 --> 2:39:58.640]  we have now. Okay, here's the. You talk about orange envies, he's wearing a orange outfit
[2:39:58.640 --> 2:40:03.680]  of your radio listener with a bunch of little oranges on her mask. And so again, COVID-19's
[2:40:03.680 --> 2:40:08.080]  Trump's fault. He has rallies, he's bad, but Democrats can have their rallies. They're going to
[2:40:08.080 --> 2:40:13.680]  try to say he killed everybody. It's his fault with the UN coming in blaming us, China blaming us,
[2:40:13.680 --> 2:40:18.320]  Hodge twins. This is pretty damn obvious. The Democrats are a party that literally works
[2:40:18.320 --> 2:40:24.560]  with outside powers to bring down the country. Yeah, and it does total evil. Just keep continuing
[2:40:24.560 --> 2:40:30.720]  to politicize this global pandemic on one man is asinine. Doesn't make sense. It's a virus.
[2:40:31.440 --> 2:40:35.600]  Nobody can stop a virus. What about the weird ass orange? She's all wearing all orange.
[2:40:36.800 --> 2:40:41.760]  I mean, she is matching. I thought matching got over. That was like an 80s or 90s thing, right?
[2:40:41.760 --> 2:40:45.680]  You can throw some black in our black mask. We look just fine. You gotta go to oranges,
[2:40:45.680 --> 2:40:49.280]  doesn't that do? Like she going to church or something. She forgot that mask when she went
[2:40:49.280 --> 2:40:54.400]  to go get her hair blown out. Oh, yeah. Nobody. Oh, and life foot says, I'm important. I get
[2:40:54.400 --> 2:41:00.640]  my hair done. Same thing with Pelosi. Yeah, she ain't no bar her hair stylist. Yeah. And Pelosi,
[2:41:00.640 --> 2:41:05.360]  when a lot of people forget, like when Trump banned travel from China, where does she go?
[2:41:05.360 --> 2:41:10.800]  She went down to Chinatown to start hugging Chinese people and saying, don't listen to Trump.
[2:41:10.800 --> 2:41:16.000]  Everything's fine. We need the airplanes landing. Yeah, everything's just fine.
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:20.400]  And then when Fauci said, no, nobody needs to wear a mask. He used the signs, right?
[2:41:21.040 --> 2:41:24.880]  Now, all of a sudden, wear a mask and they blame it. Trump for that. I'm like, yeah,
[2:41:24.880 --> 2:41:29.280]  I mean, if people just pay attention to these evil people on the left, you would see they're
[2:41:29.280 --> 2:41:34.240]  just using you to gain power. That's all they're in the in this for politicizing the crisis.
[2:41:34.240 --> 2:41:38.080]  And the problem is the Republicans used to be kind of bad too. But man, compared to different
[2:41:38.080 --> 2:41:42.960]  Republicans have gotten better with Trump and the conservative movement.
[2:41:42.960 --> 2:41:45.600]  And the Democrats have gotten worse. I mean, it's like, that's how it works.
[2:41:45.600 --> 2:41:48.800]  Things don't usually stay the same. They get better or worse. Republicans got better.
[2:41:48.800 --> 2:41:53.520]  Democrats got worse. You agree with that statement? Oh, yeah. It's show it. Proof.
[2:41:53.520 --> 2:41:56.880]  To show you proof. Look what liquid debate last night between Pence and Kamala
[2:41:57.440 --> 2:42:00.800]  were way better than the left. Not even the same ballpark.
[2:42:02.640 --> 2:42:06.560]  Why do you think they couldn't have filled somebody better than Kamala Harris and Joe Biden?
[2:42:06.560 --> 2:42:11.680]  You know what it is? They thought they painted his picture. She's a person of color. She's a
[2:42:11.680 --> 2:42:16.400]  black woman. They didn't pick her because she's well qualified. I mean, it showed in the base.
[2:42:16.400 --> 2:42:22.320]  She's a horrible debater. She's a horrible person in general. Yeah, she came off real kind of
[2:42:22.320 --> 2:42:26.800]  sending. She had me fooled that for a second. I thought I said, maybe she is black because
[2:42:26.800 --> 2:42:32.480]  she came off like an angry black woman last night.
[2:42:32.480 --> 2:42:36.640]  You know, I'll be. Yeah, she's not qualified to be vice president show last night.
[2:42:37.280 --> 2:42:40.960]  When it comes to Democrats, they don't look at people's qualifications. They are all they care
[2:42:40.960 --> 2:42:45.360]  about is what's your race, your gender, your sexuality. They don't look at your qualifications
[2:42:45.360 --> 2:42:48.720]  anymore. Which really dehumanizes you instead of looking at you as an individual at Martin Luther
[2:42:48.720 --> 2:42:52.320]  King said, which makes sense. No, I look at you as what color you are. That's not right.
[2:42:53.040 --> 2:42:58.560]  And it's where they call us self progressive. They are regressive. This is that mindset
[2:42:58.560 --> 2:43:03.200]  that it based on everything around your race. That's what led to white supremacy. Now you're
[2:43:03.200 --> 2:43:08.320]  having the black people Latinos think the very same way, that very same mindset. And that's
[2:43:08.320 --> 2:43:12.080]  what's divided in this country. It's not the right. It's the left. Yeah.
[2:43:14.800 --> 2:43:17.840]  Let's talk to Stephen Idaho. You're on the air with the hodge twins. What's your take on the
[2:43:17.840 --> 2:43:27.040]  situation? Alex Jones, master Jedi. Alex, when I was a kid, about eight years old, I'm 66. Now,
[2:43:27.040 --> 2:43:32.240]  my mom made a statement one day and it really stuck. She said, we need to get out of the UN.
[2:43:32.240 --> 2:43:35.600]  I said, what do you mean, mom? She said, it's not good for us.
[2:43:38.560 --> 2:43:42.400]  And boy, has the John Burt society and all the right wingers been proven right about the UN?
[2:43:43.600 --> 2:43:54.480]  She was a diehard John Pert society person. And you are the best thing that has happened to this
[2:43:54.480 --> 2:43:59.600]  planet. I know about that, but I'm sure it's not rolling over to the UN takeover.
[2:44:02.080 --> 2:44:08.160]  A theory and it's a diehard accident only. Nobody's getting to Alex Jones.
[2:44:10.560 --> 2:44:13.840]  Well, brother, God bless you. You got any take on what's happened on this election? Any
[2:44:13.840 --> 2:44:19.360]  comments with the hodge twins? Trump or die? Well, God bless you.
[2:44:19.360 --> 2:44:24.880]  God bless you, Steven. God bless your mother. Man, I tell you hodge twins, I don't know about
[2:44:24.880 --> 2:44:29.200]  your family or stuff, but I remember old timers. I was like little UN takeover, world government,
[2:44:29.200 --> 2:44:33.600]  castle society, computers running your life. When I was a kid, I thought they were full of it. Then
[2:44:33.600 --> 2:44:37.680]  I went to college. They were admitting it all. I was saying it was good. Were those old timers,
[2:44:37.680 --> 2:44:41.280]  did you know any old timers like that that saw all this 50 years ahead, 30 years ahead?
[2:44:42.240 --> 2:44:48.720]  Oh, yeah. Yeah. I thought they was crazy. You know, we was crazy. Yeah. You know,
[2:44:48.720 --> 2:44:52.080]  when you're young and you come up in life, you think you know everything and you listen to your
[2:44:52.080 --> 2:44:57.280]  parents and your grandparents that, oh, you just, oh, you just see now. I'm not looking back on it.
[2:44:57.280 --> 2:45:02.000]  Those people are speaking a lot of sense. I just, yeah, wasn't aware of what was going on in life.
[2:45:02.000 --> 2:45:05.440]  A lot of times you just got learned shit the hard way. Yeah. That's right. And of course,
[2:45:05.440 --> 2:45:13.280]  you know, the main cohort of the UN is now Chinese. Right. Right. Chinese. Chinese.
[2:45:13.280 --> 2:45:18.720]  I think another thing is Chinese, but they're under a communist enslavement army and follow
[2:45:18.720 --> 2:45:22.400]  orders like robots. So I don't dislike them because they're Chinese. I dislike them because
[2:45:22.400 --> 2:45:27.360]  they're under a communist system and are a robot. Yeah, we look, we don't hate them because of
[2:45:27.360 --> 2:45:31.760]  that nationality or race or anything. It's about your ideas and what you stand for. Nobody
[2:45:31.760 --> 2:45:36.800]  in here in America, we stand for freedom. Yeah, we stand, especially here on the right, man. We
[2:45:36.800 --> 2:45:40.640]  believe in limited government. We believe in freedom. We don't believe in some government
[2:45:40.640 --> 2:45:44.400]  telling us how to live our lives. Yeah, that's right. One of the military parade to thank the
[2:45:44.400 --> 2:45:48.240]  military, but also so channel what we got. And the media said, that's fascist. You can't, but
[2:45:48.240 --> 2:45:54.880]  our media praises this was easy paying. It's crazy. It's just like people don't pay attention
[2:45:54.880 --> 2:46:00.160]  what the left is pushing. Yeah. They're hypocrites. Yeah. The hypocrisy is you can see it every day.
[2:46:00.160 --> 2:46:05.040]  All you have to do is look, it's just that people are so biased on the left, they're not saying it.
[2:46:05.040 --> 2:46:08.880]  Yeah. And the Antifa calls himself anti-fascist. They are the fascist one.
[2:46:08.880 --> 2:46:13.840]  Yeah. Ronald Reagan said it best. He said if fascism ever comes to America, it's going to come
[2:46:13.840 --> 2:46:18.800]  through liberalism. That's right. That I thought he was an old crazy white man looking, looking back
[2:46:18.800 --> 2:46:23.280]  on it. He was making a lot of sense. Absolutely. Let's take one more call and I'm going to let
[2:46:23.280 --> 2:46:26.400]  you guys go get back to your board work. I'll come back, take a few more calls out of Larry Binkney.
[2:46:26.400 --> 2:46:28.640]  Let's talk to Josh in Florida. You're on the air with the Hodge twins.
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:34.000]  How are you doing, Alex? I just wanted to give a shout out to your products real quick. My two
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:45.120]  favorite are the iodine and the vitamin mineral fusion. Everybody can go to sustainabledevelopment.un.org.
[2:46:45.120 --> 2:46:50.480]  You can click on the resource tabs and you can see all their publications. They pretty much,
[2:46:51.920 --> 2:46:57.120]  they lay it out for you. There's going to be gender neutral, sustainable cities,
[2:46:57.120 --> 2:47:07.920]  and it's all going to happen. Back on December 17th, 2019, I spoke to you and we talked about
[2:47:07.920 --> 2:47:16.160]  the APEC subdivision and you called out, be prepared for an attack by another country or
[2:47:16.160 --> 2:47:24.000]  organization. I keep thinking about that and I just can't believe how that was able to come about.
[2:47:24.000 --> 2:47:28.640]  And then I called again in February and talked about- I'll tell you what, I'm out of time with
[2:47:28.640 --> 2:47:32.320]  the Hodge twins. Stay there. Don't hang up. I'm going to go back to you, Josh. And then we're
[2:47:32.320 --> 2:47:37.040]  going to Rob and Pete and Mike. And then we got Larry Binkney coming up. Hodge twins, you guys are
[2:47:37.040 --> 2:47:41.280]  amazing. People can find your great YouTube and Twitter and all the wonderful things you do.
[2:47:41.840 --> 2:47:47.360]  Closing 30 second statement. This election is coming up. Don't take it for granted.
[2:47:47.360 --> 2:47:53.520]  Yeah. I mean, I was listening to the debate reaction last night and they're saying Biden's 16
[2:47:53.520 --> 2:47:58.960]  points ahead. I don't know if that's true or not, but I implore everybody. We need to get out and
[2:47:58.960 --> 2:48:04.560]  vote. This country is at a crossroads. Trump needs to get four more years so we can keep this country
[2:48:04.560 --> 2:48:08.720]  going in the right direction because of Biden and Kalamala Harris getting there. They're going to
[2:48:08.720 --> 2:48:13.040]  pack the cards. They're going to try to diffuse that separation of powers about government. They're
[2:48:13.040 --> 2:48:17.600]  going to push to have a liberal agenda. Absolutely. Hodge twins. God bless you. And thanks for joining
[2:48:17.600 --> 2:48:21.440]  us. We'll be talking to you soon. Thank you, Alex. Thank you. Thank you. All right. We're going to jam
[2:48:21.440 --> 2:48:26.160]  into a few final calls and get Larry Binkney on and then Owen Schreuer and the war room is coming
[2:48:26.160 --> 2:48:33.840]  up. But that was a last hour. It was another powerful hour. Thanks to all of you. The Bible
[2:48:33.840 --> 2:48:39.600]  talks about there being 10 kings of the earth that sit above the nation states and who give their
[2:48:39.600 --> 2:48:45.680]  power unto the one world leader, the antichrist, and that he has a beast system that no one could
[2:48:45.680 --> 2:48:50.800]  buy and or sell unless he has that marked in the forehead or in the palm of their hand. And we look
[2:48:50.800 --> 2:48:57.040]  back on all the warnings you were given and all just the common sense that even if we believe in
[2:48:57.040 --> 2:49:03.440]  God, we're promising giving governments the corporations the power to control who can buy
[2:49:03.440 --> 2:49:08.720]  and who can sell to track everything we do. He's not just a recipe. It's a blueprint for a total
[2:49:08.720 --> 2:49:13.520]  enslave. But now you look at Bill Gates, you look at Bloomberg and others who openly say
[2:49:13.520 --> 2:49:18.960]  we're technocrats. We should decide how much salt you get, how much alcohol you get, how much red
[2:49:18.960 --> 2:49:23.520]  meat you get. We're technocrats. We know best. We're now going to set up the economy with a
[2:49:23.520 --> 2:49:29.200]  social score to totally control you. You snap your fingers. We're here. They're just rolling it out.
[2:49:29.760 --> 2:49:31.840]  And a lot of people are complying with it. It's insane.
[2:49:31.840 --> 2:49:40.240]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:49:48.480 --> 2:49:53.440]  Infowars has been banned, arrested,
[2:49:53.440 --> 2:50:04.640]  and threatened because we are effective. The great awakening is here.
[2:50:04.640 --> 2:50:09.040]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[2:50:11.040 --> 2:50:15.200]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com
[2:50:15.200 --> 2:50:22.800]  and never give up the fight.
[2:50:22.800 --> 2:50:40.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:52.800 --> 2:51:02.400]  You're the devil.
[2:51:03.440 --> 2:51:06.400]  All right, Larry Pinkney's coming up. I'm going to take your phone calls right now. I really
[2:51:06.400 --> 2:51:11.920]  appreciate all of you. I think about our ancestors, people of forest that knew about this way ahead
[2:51:11.920 --> 2:51:17.200]  of it. Now dead on they were. But that's because the globalists were already in government, the
[2:51:17.200 --> 2:51:22.000]  military promoting us. So people were in the meetings and they heard it. They people tried to recruit
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:29.440]  them. They didn't just try to recruit, you know, people that they thought were going to go along
[2:51:29.440 --> 2:51:33.200]  with. They tried to recruit everybody. All right, let's go ahead and go back to Josh.
[2:51:34.240 --> 2:51:39.920]  Josh in Florida, you're on the air finishing up the point you were making about this apex.
[2:51:39.920 --> 2:51:48.560]  Go back and re-describe that for me. Yes, Alex. So back in December 17, 2019,
[2:51:48.560 --> 2:51:54.880]  I had called and talked about we reached the apex of division. And after I made that point,
[2:51:55.600 --> 2:52:02.240]  you said we are at the apex. There's going to be a crescendo and watch out for another
[2:52:02.240 --> 2:52:09.040]  organization or another country to pull something. And then this coronavirus happened. And I had
[2:52:09.040 --> 2:52:14.560]  called in again in February and I said that this was a pincer attack between the World Health
[2:52:14.560 --> 2:52:22.240]  Organization and China. And you go to sustainabledevelopment.un.org. You could see the plan
[2:52:22.240 --> 2:52:27.680]  there. And my concern is after four more years of Trump, these people know how to play the long
[2:52:27.680 --> 2:52:36.000]  game. They don't care. And my concern is the Republican party after Trump, after four more years.
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:40.080]  Yeah, people have to accept the full evil, the new world order, and then resist it and realize
[2:52:40.080 --> 2:52:44.160]  there's no quarter, all of it's a fraud. And we've got to dismantle the whole damn thing.
[2:52:44.160 --> 2:52:48.400]  And I think Trump's starting to pull out of the UN is the right direction. The UN must be dissolved
[2:52:48.400 --> 2:52:52.160]  and eradicated. It is a criminal organization set up by the Rockefellers.
[2:52:56.160 --> 2:53:03.520]  Yeah, but they even state in Agenda 2030 that by any means necessary, they're going to achieve their
[2:53:03.520 --> 2:53:11.200]  goal. And that is like literally at the bottom of that document. So they don't care about your
[2:53:11.200 --> 2:53:16.000]  state. They don't care about your constitution. They don't care about your country. They're gonna
[2:53:17.120 --> 2:53:22.880]  come in and they don't care how long it takes, but they're gonna do whatever they can. So the
[2:53:22.880 --> 2:53:28.720]  Republican Party, don't put all your hopes in Trump. We've got to stay vigilant.
[2:53:28.720 --> 2:53:32.000]  No, I totally agree with you. We've got to do it ourselves with God's help. Thank you,
[2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:37.760]  Josh. Great points. Okay, who's going the longest now? That would be Bob in New York.
[2:53:37.760 --> 2:53:44.160]  Bob, go ahead. Thanks for holding. Hey, Alex, love you, man. Love you. Listen, man, we talked,
[2:53:44.160 --> 2:53:48.240]  you know, going on that last guy, you did predict something when you were on the phone with me.
[2:53:48.240 --> 2:53:52.800]  One time I talked to you right after you shaved your head, you were asking, what are they going
[2:53:52.800 --> 2:53:57.440]  to do next? What are they going to do next? And it was, I said, you know, our lady before me that
[2:53:57.440 --> 2:54:01.600]  day said, I think they're going to kill 3000 people. And I called in and said, you know,
[2:54:01.600 --> 2:54:06.560]  what does 3000 people mean to them? And I said, probably a pandemic and you had already,
[2:54:06.560 --> 2:54:11.120]  you've been talking about it for years, but that was January or February. You didn't want to admit
[2:54:11.120 --> 2:54:17.920]  that this might actually happen. It was scary for a little while. So, you know, I'm an out of work
[2:54:17.920 --> 2:54:22.960]  personal trainer in New York. So do the math, count up how many gyms are open and see how happy I
[2:54:22.960 --> 2:54:29.040]  am. Right. But all the big box stores, they're open. They can be open, but you can't see how sick
[2:54:29.040 --> 2:54:35.920]  that is. You're not essential, but Walmart is. Target is BS. Health is not official. Every homeless
[2:54:35.920 --> 2:54:39.440]  person would be dead. Every mailman, every liquor store owner would be dead if this was for real.
[2:54:39.440 --> 2:54:44.400]  But anyway, I wanted to answer your question earlier about the cashless society or the UN
[2:54:44.400 --> 2:54:49.600]  and tie in the cashless society. And another, this isn't a vision. This is something I think your
[2:54:49.600 --> 2:54:56.240]  writer should be getting on is about the crypto cashless society because it makes it sexy and
[2:54:56.240 --> 2:55:00.560]  the stimulus checks may go that way. And I think you guys are missing out on something. Don't call
[2:55:00.560 --> 2:55:04.400]  Kaiser because Kaiser thinks Bitcoin is the only thing, but if there's stuff that's out there
[2:55:04.400 --> 2:55:09.360]  that's bigger and better, smaller and better, actually greener and better, it's the cloud.
[2:55:09.360 --> 2:55:15.360]  And if he puts the stimulus checks on crypto, everybody's going to sign up for it. And that's
[2:55:15.360 --> 2:55:22.960]  how much we're worth. $1,200 to sell our soul for a wallet. And there's already legislation.
[2:55:22.960 --> 2:55:28.720]  This isn't my speculation. There's crypto Twitter is alive with this. You got to research it. I
[2:55:28.720 --> 2:55:34.880]  could tell you, you know, where it could go. Trump could save us from this cold. If you were the
[2:55:34.880 --> 2:55:39.600]  cold, very interesting. Send me an email about it or call back in. This is important. But right back.
[2:55:42.160 --> 2:55:46.720]  For more than 100 years, the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to establish world
[2:55:46.720 --> 2:55:52.080]  government, abolish nation states, dumb down the population by taking control of education,
[2:55:52.080 --> 2:55:58.480]  and most importantly, taking control of Western medicine. Now they had a bad name by the 1920s.
[2:55:58.480 --> 2:56:03.920]  They started converting over and funding other organizations and groups like IBM to continue
[2:56:03.920 --> 2:56:09.920]  on with their eugenics operations. Fast forward to the 1980s, the baton is handed
[2:56:09.920 --> 2:56:15.600]  by IBM via his mother on the board of directors to Bill Gates, the third, his father, of course,
[2:56:15.600 --> 2:56:20.080]  being the head of Planned Parenthood. And now he's been able to position himself over almost
[2:56:20.080 --> 2:56:27.120]  every health department in the world, every national health system. Bill Gates is in control.
[2:56:27.120 --> 2:56:33.360]  They have spent 100 plus years getting positioned to be able to control what happens to your body
[2:56:33.360 --> 2:56:37.840]  and what goes in your body. This is the holy grail of their operations. And now they're
[2:56:37.840 --> 2:56:57.520]  normalizing, putting a new type of DNA in your body. Maybe I didn't treat you, quite as good as I should be.
[2:56:57.520 --> 2:57:18.160]  Maybe I didn't love you, what as often as I could. Little things I should have said and done are just
[2:57:18.160 --> 2:57:31.600]  never to the time. You were always on my mind. You were always on my mind. I think a final call here
[2:57:32.400 --> 2:57:37.040]  and then play a very special video on the get to Larry Pinkney who's here with us.
[2:57:37.040 --> 2:57:41.040]  We're really honored to have him. But let's go ahead and talk to
[2:57:42.080 --> 2:57:44.160]  Pete in Michigan. Pete, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[2:57:44.160 --> 2:57:50.720]  Thank you very much for your time, Alex. You have wonderful products. They've
[2:57:50.720 --> 2:57:57.360]  honestly changed my life. I refer everybody to your products as well. Thank you for that.
[2:57:58.080 --> 2:58:05.760]  Podge twins are great. What I have to say though is with the debate last night, Kamala Harris,
[2:58:05.760 --> 2:58:12.560]  I mean, the Democrats say what they're going to do. I'm from Michigan. Look at Governor Whitmer,
[2:58:12.560 --> 2:58:19.360]  whatever you want to call her up here. Anything that they want to do, they say that they're
[2:58:19.360 --> 2:58:25.600]  going to do. Kamala Harris, she's saying that she's supposedly going to open up the economy. Well,
[2:58:26.560 --> 2:58:32.160]  Whitmer is continuing to shut everything down. I mean, you don't have to look very far to see
[2:58:32.160 --> 2:58:37.440]  what their agenda is. I mean, they can try to lie and look at the camera all they want and
[2:58:37.440 --> 2:58:43.920]  Whimper and have that fake tear come rolling down their eyes when her mom is looking down from her
[2:58:44.800 --> 2:58:49.440]  is what she said last night in the debate. Kamala Harris looking down from her. I said,
[2:58:49.440 --> 2:58:55.760]  yeah, looking down or looking up. I mean, what's your thoughts on that?
[2:58:57.360 --> 2:59:01.120]  Well, I mean, you just said it. They want to bankrupt the country. They want to keep it locked
[2:59:01.120 --> 2:59:05.920]  down. Clearly, oh, a militia was planning to kidnap her in Michigan. That's a false flag,
[2:59:05.920 --> 2:59:12.560]  you know, right on time. And yeah, they're honest about it. I mean, I think Trump needs to move
[2:59:12.560 --> 2:59:16.720]  with interstate commerce clauses against it. The Supreme Court, they're already said what she's
[2:59:16.720 --> 2:59:24.000]  doing is illegal. And then here comes the FBI to the rescue of Governor Whitmer. Yep, yep,
[2:59:24.000 --> 2:59:28.800]  exactly. I mean, we could all see what's going to happen. I guarantee several more stages like this
[2:59:28.800 --> 2:59:36.560]  before the election on these quote unquote, governors who are doing exactly what they think
[2:59:36.560 --> 2:59:41.360]  is right, quote, you know, air quotes. I mean, does she not I'm sorry, does she not just look
[2:59:41.360 --> 2:59:47.280]  like a villain? Just like governor, just like governor in California. I mean, she just looks
[2:59:47.280 --> 2:59:52.800]  like a crook. I don't go off that's my looks. But man, the governor of California, she people
[2:59:52.800 --> 2:59:59.840]  like she just looks evil. Yep, those eyes that big, crazy, phony smile. Anytime she ever talks
[2:59:59.840 --> 3:00:05.440]  about a lockdown, it's always for the for the betterment of the health. Stay inside, stay safe
[3:00:05.440 --> 3:00:09.440]  is just getting nailed into everybody's heads. And now you got people that are even afraid to go
[3:00:09.440 --> 3:00:14.400]  outside and get some vitamin D. Yeah, we're asking where she's going next. Yeah, the UN says the
[3:00:14.400 --> 3:00:19.680]  lockdown never ends. The force inoculations don't end it. The model is permanent martial law.
[3:00:19.680 --> 3:00:24.000]  And it's this power cult, they put all this scum in, and they're doing it. God bless you.
[3:00:24.000 --> 3:00:27.600]  Meanwhile, China is open for business. All right, I want to play the short two and a half minute
[3:00:27.600 --> 3:00:32.320]  clip of Larry Pinkney that got millions of views on Facebook, millions of views on other sites.
[3:00:32.320 --> 3:00:36.160]  And of course, they took it down, the folks reuploaded and it's got hundreds of thousands of views
[3:00:36.160 --> 3:00:40.400]  again. It's posted up at band.video. I'll give you the title of it in a moment.
[3:00:41.440 --> 3:00:45.760]  But first, I just want to remind listeners, we're not going to be here on air without you.
[3:00:45.760 --> 3:00:50.240]  And that's why we're doing a fundraiser. We haven't done one in about a year and a half,
[3:00:51.440 --> 3:00:56.320]  because it costs a lot of money to pay for the lawyers, pay for the all the regulations,
[3:00:56.320 --> 3:01:05.840]  all the all the cyber stuff, all of the IT, the crew, the equipment. Nobody built something like
[3:01:05.840 --> 3:01:10.480]  this because it's hard to build something like this because it's expensive to build something
[3:01:10.480 --> 3:01:14.960]  like this. But because of you supporting us and spread the word and all the great guests and
[3:01:14.960 --> 3:01:21.600]  hosts we have, we still reach millions of millions of people and used to we were 50 50 a joke online.
[3:01:21.600 --> 3:01:26.960]  Now you look at the comments on YouTube like 95% or positive. And I talked Joe Rogan called me up
[3:01:26.960 --> 3:01:30.080]  in other big national talk shows. They said, yeah, you're right about all this. We can't believe it.
[3:01:30.080 --> 3:01:34.560]  And, you know, they go on their shows and say, yeah, Jones was right. I mean, other big Fox host,
[3:01:34.560 --> 3:01:38.080]  other big radio hosts, it's not about, oh, look, people say Alex Jones is right.
[3:01:39.120 --> 3:01:43.520]  We've been proven out of all these different dogmas and lies and left, right. And we're just
[3:01:43.520 --> 3:01:48.960]  have a human message of freedom against the globalist and their eugenics message and people
[3:01:48.960 --> 3:01:55.760]  are resonating with it. So we can't stay on air without your support. We have big sales and
[3:01:55.760 --> 3:02:00.960]  info or store.com. They extended the sale at prepare with Alex dot com on the highest quality

[3:02:14.960 --> 3:02:19.520]  a special like this in five years. They've extended it a few days and a few days more,
[3:02:19.520 --> 3:02:24.000]  three days, 12 hours, 47 minutes. I believe you need storeable food. This is high quality
[3:02:25.040 --> 3:02:31.440]  and it funds our operation. And then separately we have the everything must go info wars special
[3:02:31.440 --> 3:02:37.760]  that's running right now on all of our products like winter sun, high quality vitamin D three and

[3:02:43.440 --> 3:02:48.960]  and that funds our operation. So it's your word of mouth. It's your prayer. It's your support. And
[3:02:48.960 --> 3:02:53.280]  I want to thank you. I'm not bitching saying you to be here supporting us. I'm thanking you, but
[3:02:53.280 --> 3:03:00.080]  just saying we have already over 50 lawsuits filed by the DNC funded groups knocked out all but seven
[3:03:01.120 --> 3:03:05.360]  and by the grace of God, knock on wood. They've not been following more in a long time.
[3:03:05.360 --> 3:03:09.840]  And they know they're getting beaten. And I know Bloomberg and Soros and others fund them.
[3:03:10.400 --> 3:03:16.400]  That's on record. And so we're winning there too. They want us off the air so bad. They can taste
[3:03:16.400 --> 3:03:22.000]  it. They can feel they can smell it. But because of you, we're still on air. But I've had to stop
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:26.080]  writing checks to other organizations and other groups and flying in a bunch of guests and flying
[3:03:26.080 --> 3:03:31.760]  our river where because we've got cut down so much over the years that we just don't have it.
[3:03:31.760 --> 3:03:37.520]  So I need to come to you with hat in hand for my future, for your future and say, please
[3:03:37.520 --> 3:03:43.040]  support this independent operation. Go to infowarstore.com. It's not for auto ship and additional
[3:03:43.040 --> 3:03:48.400]  10% off. We have triple patriot points. We never do that should have said that that's 15% off on
[3:03:48.400 --> 3:03:52.160]  your future order. These are the biggest cells in our history because if Trump doesn't win,
[3:03:52.160 --> 3:03:55.040]  we're probably going to lose everything anyway. So I just need to have funds to operate as long
[3:03:55.040 --> 3:03:59.760]  as I can. So it's our emergency SOS cell. Please take advantage of it. Here's the powerful two
[3:03:59.760 --> 3:04:03.600]  and a half minute video with Larry Pinkney. Then we'll come back after the break with him. Here
[3:04:03.600 --> 3:04:07.360]  he is with one of the most powerful speeches. This blows away Martin Luther King. Here it is.
[3:04:10.800 --> 3:04:18.240]  Right in front of our very eyes, we are seeing the globalist deep state at work. Black Lives
[3:04:18.240 --> 3:04:27.360]  Matter and Antifa. What a terrible, terrible blight upon all people. Antifa, which they claim
[3:04:27.360 --> 3:04:35.120]  means anti-fascist is absurd, ludicrous and totally opposite of what they claim to be.
[3:04:35.120 --> 3:04:44.160]  They are not anti-fascists. They are the fascists. Black Lives Matter. It's a ruse, R-U-S-E. If Black
[3:04:44.160 --> 3:04:51.600]  Lives Matter, then why don't we do something about what is happening, blacked on black,
[3:04:51.600 --> 3:04:59.040]  killing black in places like Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, Washington D.C. It's an endless list
[3:04:59.040 --> 3:05:06.400]  that won't be missed. So the bottom line here is that it's about divide, confusion, chaos and
[3:05:06.400 --> 3:05:14.960]  conquer. What we're watching here is insanity. In particular, the deep state Democrats and
[3:05:14.960 --> 3:05:22.880]  their suspicious, despicable, lying media are fanning the flames. I urge all of my brothers
[3:05:22.880 --> 3:05:29.440]  and sisters, don't go for the ghosts. Okay, don't be duped, good-winked, bamboozled. Okay,
[3:05:29.440 --> 3:05:36.960]  understand that we are in this struggle as patriots, as U.S. citizens, together. What we have on our
[3:05:36.960 --> 3:05:44.480]  side is we have each other. Each other. And that's extremely powerful. And that's something
[3:05:44.480 --> 3:05:50.240]  that the media, the deep state Democrats and the Rhino Republicans, for that matter,
[3:05:50.240 --> 3:05:55.280]  they don't want you to know that. They want you to think that you're alone. You're by yourself.
[3:05:55.280 --> 3:06:01.680]  You're not alone. You're not by yourself. And there are a lot of people, millions, millions,
[3:06:01.680 --> 3:06:10.320]  who are thinking just like you. This is our Republic. This is all about fun and games
[3:06:10.320 --> 3:06:16.400]  and hurting people and destroying, not building, not serving the people, body and soul,
[3:06:16.400 --> 3:06:24.640]  but the exact opposite. So I plead with, implore with, too, all my brothers and sisters of all
[3:06:24.640 --> 3:06:32.000]  colors, get a grip on reality, stop this madness, stop this insanity. And those who won't stop it
[3:06:32.000 --> 3:06:42.800]  need to be stopped.
[3:07:02.800 --> 3:07:07.440]  is a clone of the side of the exact same links, the exact same videos, we can comment,
[3:07:07.440 --> 3:07:13.280]  you can share them, everything. The system is censoring because the power of the people
[3:07:13.280 --> 3:07:18.000]  overrode them four years ago. Trump has finally figured this out. Since he's going to take action
[3:07:18.000 --> 3:07:21.840]  once reelected against big tech, I mean, he's modern in this situation. Well, we know the
[3:07:21.840 --> 3:07:25.760]  president's overwhelmed right now. So we're going to sit here and cry because he has taken action.
[3:07:25.760 --> 3:07:30.400]  We, the people, are taking action now. And you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020Election

[3:09:10.160 --> 3:09:20.560]  We'll get the real history of the Black Panther party in the civil rights movement
[3:09:20.560 --> 3:09:25.600]  versus what Soros has done and what they've set up and follow him at reality underscore one.
[3:09:26.800 --> 3:09:29.680]  Larry Pinkney is a veteran of the Black Panther party when the founders,
[3:09:29.680 --> 3:09:34.480]  the former minister of interior, the Republic of New Africa, former political prisoner,
[3:09:34.480 --> 3:09:39.120]  and the only American to have successfully self offered his civil political rights case
[3:09:39.120 --> 3:09:43.280]  United Nations under the international covenant on civil and political rights. So he knows about
[3:09:43.280 --> 3:09:48.720]  the UM connection with his political organizing activities in opposition to voter suppression.
[3:09:48.720 --> 3:09:53.360]  Pinkney was interviewed to get an 88 on the national televised PBS news hour formally known,
[3:09:53.360 --> 3:09:57.520]  but they don't lose our hundreds of other programs, including this one in the last 15 years.
[3:09:58.160 --> 3:10:03.680]  Black commentator.com. He's a editorial board member of that. And he joins us here. Black
[3:10:03.680 --> 3:10:12.000]  activist wg.org is the main site. Black activist dot Black activist wg.org. So Larry, this is a
[3:10:12.000 --> 3:10:15.280]  shorter segment, long segment coming up. I'm going to try to shut up and give you the floor
[3:10:15.280 --> 3:10:20.400]  because I know when you get going, you get going. The current world, who the players are, where you
[3:10:20.400 --> 3:10:25.600]  see it, what you see unfolding. God bless you, my friend. I mean, you're always great on the show.
[3:10:26.400 --> 3:10:32.720]  But the stuff you did six months ago, a month ago, all of it has really gone super viral,
[3:10:32.720 --> 3:10:37.120]  despite all the attempts to suppress you. So we just love you and we love your spirit, my friend.
[3:10:38.400 --> 3:10:45.040]  Well, first and foremost, I want to thank you, my brother, Alex. I want to also say
[3:10:45.760 --> 3:10:52.000]  my greetings or send my greetings to Darren McBreen, to David Knight, to Owen Schroyer,
[3:10:52.000 --> 3:11:00.240]  to Daria, to every single one of you glorious patriots who are fighting for our Republic.
[3:11:00.240 --> 3:11:06.560]  And as we used to say back in the day, and I still say today, all power to the people,
[3:11:06.560 --> 3:11:14.560]  keep it real, make it real. So first, thank you, Alex. Keep on keeping on. Absolutely. We're the
[3:11:14.560 --> 3:11:20.960]  people. So where are we currently? You got the floor. All right. Where we are currently is we're
[3:11:20.960 --> 3:11:29.760]  standing up against what some call a quote unquote color revolution. Now, the color revolution is
[3:11:29.760 --> 3:11:36.640]  something that George Soros, Bill Gates, and a bunch of other creatures are supporting. What is
[3:11:36.640 --> 3:11:45.520]  the so-called color revolution? It's all about destabilizing governments, particularly governments
[3:11:45.520 --> 3:11:51.760]  who are in opposition to the globalist. That's what the so-called color revolution is about.
[3:11:51.760 --> 3:11:59.920]  That's why you see all this insanity and lunacy talking about defund the police, right? Defund
[3:11:59.920 --> 3:12:09.680]  them, all right? Defund these politicians, the Democrats in particular, who are all about self,
[3:12:09.680 --> 3:12:17.520]  self, self. Not you, you, you, or us, us, us, but self, self, self. And they will lie, steal,
[3:12:17.520 --> 3:12:26.080]  and cheat to do any and everything they can. Understand the history, the history of the Democrat
[3:12:26.080 --> 3:12:34.480]  Party, all right? Understand that the Democrat Party founded the Ku Klux Klan. Understand that Joe
[3:12:34.480 --> 3:12:43.200]  Biden, that old crusty white racist, all right? That Democrat, all right? Understand that his close
[3:12:43.200 --> 3:12:51.440]  buddy and friend, all right, is the late, and he is certainly not great, the late Robert Byrd. And
[3:12:51.440 --> 3:13:01.440]  who was Robert Byrd? Robert Byrd was a big time leader of the KKK, all right, and recruiter
[3:13:01.440 --> 3:13:08.560]  for the Ku Klux Klan. Let's be clear about that. The Democrats have not changed their spots,
[3:13:08.560 --> 3:13:17.520]  all right? They have not. What they have done is they have become even more insidious. The Democrats
[3:13:17.520 --> 3:13:26.320]  are not only about hating President Donald Trump and the First Lady Melania. They are about hating
[3:13:26.320 --> 3:13:38.560]  and trying to destroy you, us. Understand that this is no joke. This is real. So we, the people, must
[3:13:38.560 --> 3:13:46.560]  come together as we are doing. We must unite. Black, white, brown, red, yellow. We must unite. We also
[3:13:46.560 --> 3:13:56.560]  must understand that the Democrat Party, as difficult as this might be to swallow, the Democrat Party
[3:13:56.560 --> 3:14:06.560]  today, at this juncture in time in history, the Democrat Party is akin to the Chinese Communist
[3:14:06.560 --> 3:14:14.960]  Party. Why do I say that? Because they push the same narrative of the Chinese Communist Party.
[3:14:14.960 --> 3:14:25.200]  They play the same insipid, disgusting, dangerous game as the Chinese Communist Party. So this is
[3:14:25.200 --> 3:14:34.960]  where we are today. We need to clearly understand that our Republic is in peril. I repeat, our
[3:14:34.960 --> 3:14:46.560]  Republic is in peril. We must understand. And speaking of the UN, the UN has shown itself to be
[3:14:46.560 --> 3:14:53.600]  a debacle, a debacle against everyday ordinary people. And I know what I'm talking about.
[3:14:53.600 --> 3:14:59.840]  All right. I know what I'm talking about. I have dealt with the UN and the only US citizen
[3:14:59.840 --> 3:15:07.840]  in Black Panther Party veteran to have successfully, years ago, won a case at the UN. All right?
[3:15:08.640 --> 3:15:16.800]  So please, wake up. Wake up. Do something about it. There are some states in the United States
[3:15:16.800 --> 3:15:26.880]  that have, quote, early in-person, and I repeat, in-person voting. If you want to utilize that,
[3:15:26.880 --> 3:15:33.680]  but do it in-person. And certainly, if you don't do that, make sure you vote for the President
[3:15:34.720 --> 3:15:41.520]  on Election Day. That's what I have to say for now to begin with. Again, much love to you
[3:15:41.520 --> 3:15:46.320]  and all my brothers and sisters, Alex, at InfoWars. All power to the people.
[3:15:46.320 --> 3:15:50.880]  Absolutely. Larry, when you look at the Communist Chinese, another thing is the Chinese people,
[3:15:50.880 --> 3:15:55.760]  but the Communist Chinese are very racist, very insular, the most homogeneous group in the world,
[3:15:55.760 --> 3:16:00.000]  arguably. They admittedly are funding. I look at the end of these race war shows
[3:16:00.000 --> 3:16:03.680]  where show whites and blacks killing each other on Netflix. It's always fun about one of their
[3:16:03.680 --> 3:16:08.800]  major movie houses that China owns. They're at the UN saying America should be dissolved
[3:16:08.800 --> 3:16:12.560]  because we're a bad racist country and because we're mean to black people and they won't even
[3:16:12.560 --> 3:16:19.120]  take black people in China. It's just asinine to watch a foreign power working with the Democrats,
[3:16:19.120 --> 3:16:24.240]  as you said, who are simpatico. I mean, the Democrats are not in charge of the Chinese and
[3:16:24.240 --> 3:16:28.960]  they're not in charge of them. I agree, like they're married and they're just like in unison.
[3:16:28.960 --> 3:16:33.040]  I would think Americans would reject an authoritarian state that's killed more people
[3:16:33.040 --> 3:16:40.080]  than Hitler controlling us. I would think so too, my brother. The point is, is that the Democrats
[3:16:40.080 --> 3:16:50.240]  have or are in concert with an insidious mockingbird media, a media which is nothing more than a
[3:16:50.240 --> 3:16:58.800]  propaganda machine against the people of this country. Let's understand that. I am not exaggerating.
[3:16:58.800 --> 3:17:06.400]  This is real. So let's understand this. If we understand what we're up against, then we can
[3:17:06.400 --> 3:17:11.920]  defeat it. That's right. Use the key word, even better than simpatico, concert. You can have a
[3:17:11.920 --> 3:17:17.920]  whole hundred piece band and they're all perfectly tuned and it's all the exact same attack. And it
[3:17:17.920 --> 3:17:23.360]  and you see it gives me chills like people better take this seriously because they're saying they're
[3:17:23.360 --> 3:17:27.280]  going to try to cause a civil war. They're going to try to use getting black folks to riot as the
[3:17:27.280 --> 3:17:31.600]  cover. They admit that and it's got to be a way to stop this because it's going to hurt every
[3:17:31.600 --> 3:17:35.440]  American except people like the globalists who aren't even Americans. They're right back with
[3:17:35.440 --> 3:17:43.040]  Larry Pinkney. This is your last chance to get a pack power stack and I'm really bummed out about
[3:17:43.040 --> 3:17:48.000]  that. It started out as a sleeper product, but the people that did ordered it, loved it and sort of
[3:17:48.000 --> 3:17:52.640]  reordering it. They spread the word and became one of our best sellers. But because of the COVID
[3:17:52.640 --> 3:17:58.640]  supply chain breakdown, because there's 13 different formulas in a pack power stack, we are unable to
[3:17:58.640 --> 3:18:05.360]  secure it anymore. This is the highest in AMPM pack system you're going to find where you take
[3:18:05.360 --> 3:18:09.440]  half the pills in the morning, half the capitals and pills and shell caps at night. It's amazing.
[3:18:09.440 --> 3:18:13.840]  I don't have time to go into everything that's in it, but this gets people to remember to take it
[3:18:13.840 --> 3:18:17.680]  and that's why it's having such a great effect because the stuff in here is absolutely amazing.
[3:18:17.680 --> 3:18:23.040]  So it's your last chance to get a power stack at infowarstore.com. It's 60% off and free shipping
[3:18:23.040 --> 3:18:27.440]  that is at cost for all you that already support info wars. We're passing these savings onto you
[3:18:27.440 --> 3:18:33.120]  to your eight pack power stack now or you still can last chance to get it infowarstore.com.
[3:18:33.120 --> 3:18:42.320]  Eight pack power stack six percent off and free shipping. Hello, my name is Dr. Fauci and I've
[3:18:42.320 --> 3:18:49.920]  been at the NIH and CDC for 45 years and I've overseen well, you know, the AIDS pandemic and
[3:18:49.920 --> 3:18:57.600]  so many other things. And I take my orders from Bill Gates, Dr. Bill Gates. I mean, he's not a doctor,
[3:18:57.600 --> 3:19:05.520]  but he controls everything you do. And he now says you're going to take the shots. And of course,
[3:19:05.520 --> 3:19:11.120]  in England, they are now saying what I told you, you will not be allowed to travel. Leave your
[3:19:11.120 --> 3:19:20.240]  home until you take all the shots. Dr. Gates, I mean Bill Gates, your owner, your master says you
[3:19:20.240 --> 3:19:29.120]  will have to take four to five COVID shots a year for adult, two for baby, baby, much more manageable,
[3:19:29.760 --> 3:19:37.200]  just like Bill Gates give you polio and vaccine. I'm Dr. Fauci reminding you that we owe you.
[3:19:37.920 --> 3:19:43.920]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS
[3:19:43.920 --> 3:19:49.200]  location. I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was
[3:19:49.200 --> 3:19:55.360]  on American. Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and
[3:19:55.360 --> 3:20:01.520]  Androids, don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to,
[3:20:01.520 --> 3:20:06.720]  your relationships, and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps
[3:20:06.720 --> 3:20:13.040]  as well, including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying, just like Siri or Alexa
[3:20:13.040 --> 3:20:19.120]  Do and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved
[3:20:19.120 --> 3:20:24.080]  forever. Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based
[3:20:24.080 --> 3:20:29.360]  on information. This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score. Get your protection
[3:20:29.360 --> 3:20:36.480]  privacy pockets at infowarstore.com and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy tracks, infowarstore.com.
[3:20:36.480 --> 3:20:43.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:43.680 --> 3:21:06.400]  Well, Eddie Van Halen, a great guitarist, is dead, but his music lives on. He lives on for his
[3:21:06.400 --> 3:21:13.920]  wife and children. Larry Pinkney is our guest here today, and I really do respect his views on this,
[3:21:13.920 --> 3:21:18.960]  and I really do want to get his perspective on it. I don't used to ask these questions to
[3:21:18.960 --> 3:21:22.800]  hear somebody else talk, because he a lot of times spoke with angles that I hadn't really
[3:21:22.800 --> 3:21:26.880]  thought of, but that turned out to be really accurate. That's what we do here is we brainstorm
[3:21:26.880 --> 3:21:31.600]  with our guests and our callers. We're all here interfacing in a mind meld. You come together
[3:21:31.600 --> 3:21:35.920]  and come to the higher level. That's how we'll overcome these evil doers. But I look at a Bill
[3:21:35.920 --> 3:21:43.120]  Gates, I look at a Dr. Fauci, I look at them and I go study who they are, and then I find out
[3:21:44.000 --> 3:21:50.640]  literal people that created the Nazis. I mean, the Nazis were like little side ticks of Bill
[3:21:50.640 --> 3:21:56.480]  Gates' grandfather and father and his mother heading up IBM, and he's a front group,
[3:21:56.480 --> 3:22:02.960]  carry out eugenics. Then I see him on TV going, yeah, 80% of you that take my shot will get hurt
[3:22:02.960 --> 3:22:07.200]  and it won't even protect you. And then your life's never the same. And then it comes out
[3:22:07.200 --> 3:22:11.040]  in associated press two weeks ago. Oh, most of the polios from Bill Gates' vaccine.
[3:22:11.920 --> 3:22:17.280]  Yeah, a bunch of kids died from it. So what? So what really concerns me is they're normalizing.
[3:22:17.280 --> 3:22:22.400]  There's a point where they're beta testing and covering something up. But now they come out
[3:22:22.400 --> 3:22:26.960]  with Tuskegee level crimes or bigger. We're talking hundreds of thousands of kids they give
[3:22:26.960 --> 3:22:33.120]  polio to. And they just go, oh, big deal. They just hide it. So is it that AP is good suddenly,
[3:22:33.120 --> 3:22:39.840]  which they aren't normally? Or is it just they're normalizing it when Bill Gates is on TV and he
[3:22:39.840 --> 3:22:46.800]  goes, yeah, sorry, 700,000 of you are going to get real sick or die. Sorry. He starts smiling. And
[3:22:46.800 --> 3:22:51.600]  then he's on other shows and they go, yeah, the economy will never reopen. And he goes, I know.
[3:22:51.600 --> 3:22:59.920]  Is this a psychotic celebration? I mean, what is this where we wake up and he's in charge of all
[3:22:59.920 --> 3:23:04.160]  the medical stuff worldwide and he's laughing at us? I mean, is he trying to get us to come?
[3:23:05.040 --> 3:23:08.880]  You're a smart guy. I'm serious. I don't know why he's doing it. Why do you think he's doing it?
[3:23:08.880 --> 3:23:14.400]  Larry, he's just completely insane. I think he's doing it because he can get away with it,
[3:23:14.400 --> 3:23:20.560]  or at least for the time being, he's doing it because he can. And this is where we do people
[3:23:20.560 --> 3:23:29.200]  come in. We are the ones who can stop him from doing it. We are the ones who have to expose
[3:23:29.200 --> 3:23:36.880]  not only him today, but his background. You see, this is what so many of our brothers and sisters
[3:23:36.880 --> 3:23:44.720]  do not do enough of. They need to research, find out who these people are, research, find out who
[3:23:44.720 --> 3:23:52.800]  they are. The mockingbird insidious media, which is just a propaganda machine, will never, ever
[3:23:52.800 --> 3:23:59.600]  tell you who these people actually are. What they come from, what they're all about,
[3:23:59.600 --> 3:24:07.440]  and what they're still all about. So we, the people, must take action. First of all,
[3:24:07.440 --> 3:24:15.040]  we need to wake the heck up. All right? It does not matter what the insidious mockingbird
[3:24:15.040 --> 3:24:22.560]  vomit stream, and I call them vomit stream because they simply regurgitate the same talking points.
[3:24:23.600 --> 3:24:30.800]  But you can combat that. We can combat that by researching for ourselves. All right? And this
[3:24:30.800 --> 3:24:40.480]  is what's absolutely imperative that we do. But more or just as importantly, we must, at this
[3:24:40.480 --> 3:24:50.320]  critical juncture in time in history, we must, and I say this again, we must stand up for President
[3:24:50.320 --> 3:25:01.040]  Donald J. Trump and this republic. We are in peril. I cannot overemphasize that. The Democrats have
[3:25:01.040 --> 3:25:08.720]  become one and the same with the Chinese Communist Party. I never would have thought I would hear
[3:25:08.720 --> 3:25:17.120]  myself saying this 10 or 15 years ago. But the fact is, they are synonymous at this juncture
[3:25:17.120 --> 3:25:24.640]  with the Democrat Party. They don't give a damn about the fact that our President and First Lady
[3:25:24.640 --> 3:25:33.920]  were infected by a virus that was released by who? By the Chinese Communist Party. They talk about
[3:25:33.920 --> 3:25:43.840]  racism. They talk about racism when they are the racists. They talk about fascism when they
[3:25:43.840 --> 3:25:51.520]  are the fascists. Just check out George Soros. Just check out Bill Gates. Just check out the criminal
[3:25:51.520 --> 3:25:58.400]  families that people like Nancy Pelosi. They've all got literal Nazi eugenics pedigrees that are the
[3:25:58.400 --> 3:26:04.080]  biggest. If they were a dog, they'd be a purebred whatever. I mean, they're the top of it.
[3:26:04.880 --> 3:26:11.920]  They are. They're absolutely the top of it. And all we're seeing at this point is the tip of the
[3:26:11.920 --> 3:26:19.200]  iceberg. You know, 80 to 90% of an iceberg is underwater. We're seeing the tip. We're seeing
[3:26:19.200 --> 3:26:27.360]  people like James Comey. We're seeing people who have subverted this nation, this Republic.
[3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:35.040]  We have got to put the brakes on it now, right now. I totally agree. You know, when you said
[3:26:35.040 --> 3:26:39.920]  earlier what it is, is it's an arrogance. It's a gloating. And when I used to read criminology
[3:26:39.920 --> 3:26:44.560]  books because I was big into studying history, I thought it's ridiculous. There are certain types
[3:26:44.560 --> 3:26:50.960]  of criminals, but you learn criminal types are more kind of OCD to simplify it. They operate
[3:26:50.960 --> 3:26:54.720]  in certain ways. So once you know how criminal operates, you've kind of got that criminal
[3:26:54.720 --> 3:27:01.440]  signature. And that's what like in cartoons, the villain gloats. And it's true. Villains
[3:27:01.440 --> 3:27:09.680]  gloat and he's gloating over us. He's gloating over us once again, because he thinks we are
[3:27:09.680 --> 3:27:17.760]  so dumbed down that we have been so bamboozled that we do not have a clue, but he's wrong.
[3:27:17.760 --> 3:27:24.480]  We do have a clue. And every day, more and more people are waking up and increasing
[3:27:24.480 --> 3:27:30.480]  amount of people being a black, white, brown, red, yellow. US citizens are awakening to
[3:27:30.480 --> 3:27:36.320]  And I agree. And the attempted race war is their desperation. They actually know we're winning.
[3:27:36.320 --> 3:27:40.800]  The gloating is a confidence act because he's scared. I know people and they even admit it
[3:27:40.800 --> 3:27:45.280]  now. He was gloating a few months ago. They're scared now. They should be. They should be.
[3:27:45.280 --> 3:27:52.160]  And we have to make sure that there's plenty of reason for them to be scared. You know, when
[3:27:52.160 --> 3:27:58.800]  a dog and I like dogs, don't get me wrong. But when a dog or an other animal is cornered,
[3:27:58.800 --> 3:28:06.320]  what will that animal do? That animal will strike out viciously. So yes, they're scared,
[3:28:06.320 --> 3:28:13.280]  but we need to be totally awake and understand that they intend to strike. And that's what
[3:28:13.280 --> 3:28:19.760]  they've been doing. Come on, let's use our common sense. It is no coincidence that our president
[3:28:19.760 --> 3:28:27.120]  and First Lady were infected and that overwhelmingly Republicans have been infected. This is not a
[3:28:27.120 --> 3:28:33.440]  coincidence. For God's sake, wake up. Use your common sense. All right. And I agree. I've said
[3:28:33.440 --> 3:28:38.400]  day one that the Democrats have more weaponized versions. They're spreading. That's right.
[3:28:38.400 --> 3:28:45.920]  That's right. And as Nancy Pelosi said, and I quote, we have more arrows, quote unquote,
[3:28:45.920 --> 3:28:52.880]  in our quiver. All right. We know what that quiver is about. But guess what? My brothers and sisters,
[3:28:52.880 --> 3:28:59.120]  we have our own quiver and it's called we the people and we will not stand down.
[3:28:59.120 --> 3:29:03.040]  I agree with you. I know you talk to a lot of community folks around the country and the world
[3:29:03.040 --> 3:29:06.640]  every day. What is the sense? I get confidence from you. I think you're saying
[3:29:06.640 --> 3:29:12.880]  the pulse of the people strong. The pulse of the people is not only strong. You're absolutely
[3:29:12.880 --> 3:29:19.920]  correct. But it is getting stronger every day. The more the mockingbird insidious
[3:29:19.920 --> 3:29:26.720]  vomit stream regurgitating media puts out their propaganda, the more people are saying,
[3:29:26.720 --> 3:29:33.200]  wait a minute, let me check this out for myself. We are getting stronger. And as I've said before,
[3:29:33.200 --> 3:29:41.200]  we are not alone. We are not the races. We are not the fascists. They are and people are waking up
[3:29:41.200 --> 3:29:45.200]  to that reality. I agree with you. Here's the problem. The enemy keeps doubling down as they
[3:29:45.200 --> 3:29:48.960]  know they're losing. How much can they double down more? A war? What are they going to do as
[3:29:48.960 --> 3:29:54.960]  Trump pulls our troops out? Well, of course, they're going to do all that they can. But the
[3:29:54.960 --> 3:30:02.240]  more that they do, it's like a boomerang, a boomerang, it will continue to boomerang on them.
[3:30:02.240 --> 3:30:09.120]  The more we the people, black, white, brown, red, yellow, US citizens, we the people awaken
[3:30:09.120 --> 3:30:16.160]  and say no more. And brother, we have got to win this because at stake is our republic.
[3:30:16.160 --> 3:30:19.600]  I agree with you. Let's talk about how they're going to try to win. They know Trump's going
[3:30:19.600 --> 3:30:22.560]  to win right now. They're going to try to engage in fraud. They're going to try to trigger a race
[3:30:22.560 --> 3:30:26.960]  war as the cover for what they're doing. They admit it with the Chinese globalists and all
[3:30:26.960 --> 3:30:31.520]  of them backing it. What Larry Pickney thinks we should all do on the other side? It's do or die
[3:30:31.520 --> 3:30:39.520]  time, folks. This is game time for everything. Stay with us. The Bible talks about there being
[3:30:39.520 --> 3:30:45.120]  10 kings of the earth that sit above the nation states and who give their power unto the one
[3:30:45.120 --> 3:30:51.440]  world leader, the Antichrist, and that he has a beast system that no one should buy and or sell
[3:30:51.440 --> 3:30:56.000]  unless he has that marked in the forehead or in the palm of their hand. And we look back
[3:30:56.000 --> 3:31:01.760]  on all the warnings you were given and all just the common sense that even if we believe in God
[3:31:02.400 --> 3:31:08.560]  or prophecy, giving governments and corporations the power to control who can buy and who can sell
[3:31:08.560 --> 3:31:13.920]  to track everything we do is not just a recipe. It's a blueprint for total enslavement. And now
[3:31:13.920 --> 3:31:19.360]  you look at Bill Gates, you look at Bloomberg and others who openly say, we're technocrats.
[3:31:19.360 --> 3:31:24.400]  We should decide how much salt you get, how much alcohol you get, how much red meat you get.
[3:31:24.400 --> 3:31:28.640]  We're technocrats. We know best. We're now going to set up the economy with a social score to
[3:31:28.640 --> 3:31:34.640]  totally control you. You snap your fingers. We're here. They're just rolling it out. And a lot of
[3:31:34.640 --> 3:31:39.760]  people are complying with it. It's insane. The globalists are very, very honest about their
[3:31:39.760 --> 3:31:48.240]  planetary goals. They want private corporate governance above nation states, above religious
[3:31:48.240 --> 3:31:54.720]  institutions, above the family. They want total corporate power. There was a great film back
[3:31:54.720 --> 3:32:02.240]  in the early 1970s called Rollerball with James Cahn. And it's based on a novel set in the year 2020.
[3:32:02.880 --> 3:32:08.080]  And in the book, you have mega corporates that control the planet. There are no longer
[3:32:08.080 --> 3:32:13.760]  nation states. There are only cities that are the capitals of the corporations.
[3:32:14.320 --> 3:32:18.880]  Well, if you actually read what the Davos group of the CFR and Dr. Lionel commission say
[3:32:18.880 --> 3:32:25.040]  in the year 2020, that is their in game, that is their goal. So we're talking about a hunger game
[3:32:25.040 --> 3:32:30.720]  type scenario here run by very, very, very ruthless people to see us as chattel. They're
[3:32:30.720 --> 3:32:36.080]  using COVID-19 as their takeover strategy, the Communist China as their model. We must reject it now.
[3:32:36.080 --> 3:32:45.280]  And perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications from COVID-19,
[3:32:46.000 --> 3:32:53.920]  which are well beyond what they should be, it's estimated that 200 million people have died.
[3:32:54.560 --> 3:32:59.680]  200 million people have died. Probably by the time I finish this talk.
[3:33:00.240 --> 3:33:05.120]  Right after Joe Biden made that statement that more than 60% of America has died from
[3:33:05.120 --> 3:33:11.040]  COVID-19 when it's not even 200,000 reality, he went on to say 6 million have lung scarring
[3:33:11.040 --> 3:33:14.800]  and heart damage. It's all made up. But you know where you got it? The mainstream media that
[3:33:14.800 --> 3:33:21.920]  continues to actually say things like that. They said that 4% of America would be dead already.
[3:33:21.920 --> 3:33:28.400]  Of course, it's 0.000 and then add a number because the numbers vary. It's a real virus,
[3:33:28.400 --> 3:33:34.560]  just like people being struck by lightning is real. But to shut down society over lightning strikes
[3:33:34.560 --> 3:33:42.080]  is hysteria and is mind control. The future isn't coming, it's here. And in the future,
[3:33:42.080 --> 3:33:48.400]  keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence is going to be
[3:33:48.400 --> 3:33:54.480]  your most valuable asset. In fact, it's going to be your only asset. The world being built by the
[3:33:54.480 --> 3:34:01.360]  technocrats and the trap they've now sprung with COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning
[3:34:01.360 --> 3:34:10.000]  of the process of taking us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization. Human
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:16.480]  life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050.
[3:34:17.200 --> 3:34:22.560]  This is their stated goal. I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you,
[3:34:22.560 --> 3:34:28.880]  but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy. We turn this
[3:34:28.880 --> 3:34:34.640]  around. You must study their own writings, you must face the facts, and you must come to grips with
[3:34:35.200 --> 3:34:43.200]  you're all being incrementally destroyed. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:34:43.200 --> 3:34:53.920]  Resistance to
[3:34:53.920 --> 3:35:01.680]  Tyrants is obedience to God. From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[3:35:04.240 --> 3:35:09.760]  All right, Larry Pickney is really kicking butt. And I'm going to come in tonight. Last night,
[3:35:09.760 --> 3:35:14.000]  I didn't come in because they recovered the debate. They're doing a great job. We've got Warren
[3:35:15.600 --> 3:35:23.120]  with Damian Felder, Leo Zagami, and Fleckis Tots with Owen Schreuer, Jay Dyer, then host an hour,
[3:35:23.120 --> 3:35:27.120]  then Alexa Countdown with John Lorraine. You know, I'll probably just come in and co-host with her
[3:35:27.120 --> 3:35:32.800]  because there's a lot needs to be covered at least an hour with her. That Rex and Pat Riley,
[3:35:32.800 --> 3:35:37.920]  that should be interesting. Maybe I should host with my son, 9 to 10 p.m., Owen Schreuer and Rob
[3:35:37.920 --> 3:35:41.920]  do, then 10 to midnight, and they're going to end the transmission. Just don't forget,
[3:35:41.920 --> 3:35:45.920]  solicit or support it. We've got big sales in followers.com. I want to keep us on air. That'd
[3:35:45.920 --> 3:35:51.600]  be great. Blackactivistwg.org. If you'd like to reach out to Larry Pickney or have him on your
[3:35:51.600 --> 3:35:55.520]  show, he's a great guest. Or if you'd like to find some of the writings and work he's done,
[3:35:55.520 --> 3:35:59.040]  he's comes on for like 15 years, never asked for donation, never asked for support.
[3:35:59.600 --> 3:36:02.880]  Larry, you've got important work. I know you stay there, have a community you take care of,
[3:36:02.880 --> 3:36:08.880]  but how do people support you or how do they magnify the important work you're doing?
[3:36:09.840 --> 3:36:16.720]  All I want people to do, my dear brother, and by the way, I forgot to mention Rob do. Love you, Rob.
[3:36:18.000 --> 3:36:25.360]  Anyway, all I want people to do is to spread my message. I'm not important,
[3:36:26.000 --> 3:36:29.840]  but my message is extremely important. No, I don't say how do people do that?
[3:36:29.840 --> 3:36:38.400]  Okay. I'd love for people to go on to reality underscore one, the number one,
[3:36:38.400 --> 3:36:45.200]  which is on Twitter. I'd love for people to not simply follow me, but to retweet the message.
[3:36:45.200 --> 3:36:48.880]  I repeat. Exactly. The currency you want is liberty and humans coming together.
[3:36:49.520 --> 3:36:54.080]  That is correct. Nothing more, nothing less. You want real love. The opposite of George,
[3:36:54.080 --> 3:36:58.880]  what a vicious Nazi collaborator, literal overthrow countries, bankrupt people's currencies,
[3:36:58.880 --> 3:37:03.360]  to steal people's savings. And then they call him the best guy ever and all he wants is hate and
[3:37:03.360 --> 3:37:08.160]  division. What a demon. How could you work tirelessly for 50 years even before that as
[3:37:08.160 --> 3:37:14.320]  a Nazi collaborator to destroy people and to do that? What a monster. Because he is demonic.
[3:37:14.880 --> 3:37:22.480]  He is a lunatic and to be blunt, he's demonic. But you know, I'm not a biblical scholar per se,
[3:37:22.480 --> 3:37:30.160]  but one of my favorite quotes from the Bible is found at the book of James, chapter two,
[3:37:30.160 --> 3:37:38.080]  verse 26, that makes it clear. I'm paraphrasing, all right? But it says that faith, which we
[3:37:38.080 --> 3:37:47.120]  should all have faith without works is dead. We must have faith and we must show our faith
[3:37:47.120 --> 3:37:54.240]  through our works. And this is what the deep state globalists simply cannot stand,
[3:37:54.960 --> 3:38:01.600]  is works. Oh my God, those people have faith and they have works. You better believe it.
[3:38:01.600 --> 3:38:08.560]  And that's what it's all about. Let's come together, stick with each other, get over our
[3:38:08.560 --> 3:38:15.520]  little petty little differences. At stake is everything. Our republic, everyday ordinary
[3:38:15.520 --> 3:38:21.680]  black, white, brown, red, yellow, citizens of this country. That's all I asked. I don't ask for
[3:38:21.680 --> 3:38:28.800]  your money. I don't ask to give the money to info wars, support info wars. But please,
[3:38:28.800 --> 3:38:36.240]  not only spread their message, which is also my message, please spread it. Well, let's be clear.
[3:38:36.240 --> 3:38:40.400]  We have a very humble audience just like you're humble. But this is key, the whole big tech
[3:38:40.400 --> 3:38:46.000]  censorship, all of it, because they can't win if the truth gets out. And we're very close to winning.
[3:38:46.000 --> 3:38:50.080]  So people think, oh, I'm just a little person sharing this video. Once it's archived a band
[3:38:50.080 --> 3:38:53.920]  dot video of Larry painting today. Oh, I'm just sharing a little article. I know somebody
[3:38:53.920 --> 3:38:58.400]  criticized me doing it. No, no, that's what causes a chain reaction. Like you said,
[3:38:58.400 --> 3:39:02.640]  we're just the tip of the iceberg. The listeners are the big iceberg. They're everything.
[3:39:02.640 --> 3:39:08.400]  Then we need the big iceberg to counter the enemy. That is absolutely correct. And for
[3:39:08.400 --> 3:39:15.600]  every brother and sister listener out there, you are incredibly important. And remember that.
[3:39:16.160 --> 3:39:22.800]  Never forget that. You are incredibly important. People sometimes on Twitter and other
[3:39:24.160 --> 3:39:30.480]  platforms say, Oh, well, I only have don't worry about what you have. Put your message out there
[3:39:30.480 --> 3:39:37.360]  because I guarantee you people are seeing it. And that is how humanity will win.
[3:39:37.360 --> 3:39:40.960]  That's right. When the system tries to suppress you, like these quitter executives are on video
[3:39:40.960 --> 3:39:44.640]  going, Oh, this guy, a few thousand followers, he was reaching people, we shadow banned him. And
[3:39:44.640 --> 3:39:50.000]  now he's all depressed and quit. No, you find other accounts, other ways, other things, start
[3:39:50.000 --> 3:39:54.480]  your own thing. The point is, is that they want to make you feel small when they try to suppress
[3:39:54.480 --> 3:39:58.800]  you, fight back even stronger. Instead of like, Oh, that way it's heavy. I'm weak. Let's say there
[3:39:58.800 --> 3:40:03.280]  was a 200 pound deadlift and you weren't that strong. You tried to pick it up for a while and
[3:40:03.280 --> 3:40:06.480]  you couldn't do it. You try to pick it up enough times, you'll be able to pick it up pretty soon.
[3:40:06.480 --> 3:40:09.680]  You'll pick it up over your head. It's going to be easy. So when they try to suppress you and
[3:40:09.680 --> 3:40:14.560]  lay on you and make you feel weak, no, you use that pressure to just say, I'm pushing. And you
[3:40:14.560 --> 3:40:17.760]  know, it's not going to happen to dare tomorrow or even next month, but one day you'll be able to take
[3:40:17.760 --> 3:40:24.880]  that person metaphysically and throw them around like they're a ragdoll. Absolutely. And remember,
[3:40:25.440 --> 3:40:33.040]  David and Goliath, we are David and Goliath must meet his fate.
[3:40:33.040 --> 3:40:40.320]  But, beautifully said, obviously that these are insane times, but other, other messages,
[3:40:40.320 --> 3:40:44.640]  other things you'd like to transmit to this audience, Larry Pinkney on such a huge time.
[3:40:44.640 --> 3:40:49.360]  Well, I mean, I asked it earlier, I don't want to go there, but I know you're as smart as I am
[3:40:49.360 --> 3:40:53.520]  or smarter and you've been around longer. So you're wiser. I don't think people understand it.
[3:40:53.520 --> 3:40:58.240]  I can tell you're getting chills at a gut level. If these people get in there, they've said they're
[3:40:58.240 --> 3:41:01.920]  coming after everybody. They're going to bring us to our knees. They're going to teach us because
[3:41:01.920 --> 3:41:05.600]  we're up in the Americans and stood up for their world government. What does it look like if Trump
[3:41:05.600 --> 3:41:14.640]  loses, sir? I hate to even think about it, frankly, but I can tell you this, that if the only way
[3:41:15.600 --> 3:41:25.600]  that Trump will lose is if the Democrats and their little BLM clan Tifa, and I did say clan
[3:41:25.600 --> 3:41:36.160]  Tifa fascist allies steal the election. The people are waking up far more now than even in 2016
[3:41:36.160 --> 3:41:45.440]  when President Trump won. The only way he will lose is if they steal the election and we will
[3:41:45.440 --> 3:41:52.320]  not allow that to happen. And if it does, then we're going to have to find other options to
[3:41:52.320 --> 3:41:57.920]  make sure of these creatures. I won't call them people. I was about to say they want us to concede.
[3:41:57.920 --> 3:42:02.400]  We're not going to concede. We just have to fight it. And if it come, we don't want war on the streets,
[3:42:02.400 --> 3:42:08.240]  but if they keep pushing, we're going to defend ourselves. We must do that. That is what we as
[3:42:08.240 --> 3:42:14.080]  human beings and as Americans must do. There is no question about that. Did you notice on the debate
[3:42:14.080 --> 3:42:16.960]  they said to Trump, are you going to tell your supporters not to be violent? And Trump goes,
[3:42:16.960 --> 3:42:22.480]  we've done nothing, but we'll defend ourselves. You damn right. And that's not violence.
[3:42:22.480 --> 3:42:29.040]  Self-defense is not violence. Self-defense is defending you, your family, your home,
[3:42:29.040 --> 3:42:36.000]  your property. That's called self-defense. And how dare they talk about us being violent
[3:42:36.000 --> 3:42:43.360]  when they are the most insidiously despicable, violent creatures in this nation.
[3:42:43.360 --> 3:42:46.960]  What do you want to say to the useful idiot, blacks, whites, some Hispanics, family black and
[3:42:46.960 --> 3:42:50.960]  white that are going randomly into neighborhoods, attacking houses and stuff? Don't they get
[3:42:50.960 --> 3:42:53.200]  sorrows just trying to get them to trigger off a racial event?
[3:42:54.080 --> 3:43:02.960]  They don't get that. I say to them, wake the freak up. Get real. You know what? Wake up.
[3:43:02.960 --> 3:43:11.520]  Stop being pawns and tools. Stop being utilized. This is your country, your republic. Act like it.
[3:43:11.520 --> 3:43:18.640]  Support it. Protect it. And again, I say, as we said back in the 60s and 70s, all power to the
[3:43:18.640 --> 3:43:25.120]  people. Stop being you. Or as Malcolm said, stop being bamboozled. And I know and I believe and
[3:43:25.120 --> 3:43:30.400]  trust that you have enough sense and integrity to know that.
[3:43:30.400 --> 3:43:35.840]  In closing, Larry, please join us again soon. You're on fire. What would Martin Luther King
[3:43:35.840 --> 3:43:40.240]  in 60 seconds, and then what would Malcolm X in 60 seconds from your history, and I know
[3:43:40.240 --> 3:43:42.240]  knowing some of those guys, what would they say right now?
[3:43:43.200 --> 3:43:50.480]  They would say, stand up. It is not about the color of your skin. It is about the content
[3:43:50.480 --> 3:43:58.960]  of your character. They would say, stand up. Be strong for this republic. Be strong. Do not
[3:43:58.960 --> 3:44:07.840]  succumb. Do not succumb. We are all in this together. Wake up. That is what both Martin
[3:44:07.840 --> 3:44:12.640]  and Malcolm would have said. And their spirit is still with us.
[3:44:12.640 --> 3:44:16.480]  That's right. Malcolm was an amazing orator and very smart, but he woke up a little later that
[3:44:16.480 --> 3:44:20.960]  it was manipulation. And that's why they got rid of him. Larry Pinkney, very, very powerful,
[3:44:20.960 --> 3:44:25.680]  Black activist, WG.org. And you said the most important thing is your Twitter for people to
[3:44:25.680 --> 3:44:31.120]  follow. Give that again one more time. That is atreality underscore one. Thank you so much.
[3:44:31.120 --> 3:44:34.160]  And please join us again in the next week, sir. We love you.
[3:44:34.160 --> 3:44:39.600]  Like you, brother. Love you. Stay strong. Take care. Oh, power to the people.
[3:44:39.600 --> 3:44:44.720]  Thank you. And then the power of the people is here, folks. Listeners, this dog don't hunt without
[3:44:44.720 --> 3:44:48.960]  you. Owen Troyer has got a bunch of great guests. He's loaded for Barry. He's about to take over.
[3:44:48.960 --> 3:44:53.040]  Go to 2020ElectionsCenter.com. Take the big live feed at InfoWars and just say, hey,
[3:44:53.040 --> 3:44:56.880]  here's the forbidden news you're not supposed to see on your email list, on your text message.
[3:44:56.880 --> 3:45:00.720]  You do that. There's millions of you. It does a chain reaction. They're so scared of you.
[3:45:00.720 --> 3:45:05.120]  They're so scared you're going to do that. Great job, the crew. And you're going to have
[3:45:05.120 --> 3:45:12.080]  John Lorraine tonight by seven to nine. Rex Jones and Pat Riley. A couple of my favorite people
[3:45:12.080 --> 3:45:18.320]  but they're both goofballs. We'll see how that goes tonight. Commercial free. All of it at
[3:45:18.320 --> 3:45:22.880]  infowars.com and newswars.com. And then Owen Troyer and Rob Duke come back in. I'm going to have to
[3:45:22.880 --> 3:45:32.880]  be up for tonight. Stay with us.
