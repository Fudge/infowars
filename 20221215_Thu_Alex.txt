[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  Well, the Pentagon has publicly green-lit the cruise missile attack system, but it's
[00:29.000 --> 00:50.240]  not
[00:50.240 --> 00:55.420]  their idiots. Because I knew it, and I told you that. Oh, the spin is when the Russians
[00:55.420 --> 01:00.320]  fire a missile, we give them a lifetime. Like when Ukraine fired those missiles into Poland
[01:00.320 --> 01:08.960]  to blame it on Putin and try to get a nuclear war going a month ago.
[01:08.960 --> 01:16.360]  This is a very dramatic potential escalation, obviously, because Poland is a NATO country.
[01:16.360 --> 01:22.680]  There were ongoing cruise missile attacks being carried out in the west of Ukraine, close
[01:22.680 --> 01:30.560]  to Poland's border, at the time that these projectiles landed on Polish territory. It
[01:30.560 --> 01:36.560]  is conceivable that they are Russian missiles. I'm not pro-Russia. I'm pro-non-nuclear war.
[01:36.560 --> 01:45.400]  Shall we play a game? How about global thermal nuclear war?
[01:45.400 --> 01:50.120]  When Russia's got its problems and has committed its crimes, but compared to the new world order,
[01:50.120 --> 01:54.640]  they are amateurs, ladies and gentlemen. But they've got a giant nuclear weapons arsenal,
[01:54.640 --> 02:05.200]  they're being pushed into a corner, and now Putin's threatening nuclear war.
[02:05.200 --> 02:11.200]  Russia might as well be fighting Martians right now. The technology's 30, 40 years in advance.
[02:11.200 --> 02:18.120]  Can Russia deploy tens of thousands of one-man team launched? One guy can put two switchblades
[02:18.120 --> 02:24.120]  on his back, and those switchblades can go out and take out multiple Russian vehicles
[02:24.120 --> 02:29.600]  over the top dangerous. The Pentagon is greenlit. You've been seeing for two weeks, or 12 days,
[02:29.600 --> 02:36.240]  almost two weeks, daily cruise missile attacks into Russia, blowing up military bases. So
[02:36.240 --> 02:40.400]  Putin goes, okay, I may do a first strike with nukes. I said I wouldn't, but now I may.
[02:40.400 --> 02:45.360]  I mean, this is just huge. And now we have strikes at at least three bases inside of Russia.
[02:45.360 --> 02:50.000]  Exactly. And for him, that is very worrying, because now he knows that Ukraine could hit.
[02:50.000 --> 02:54.240]  I mean, we're talking about very close to Moscow, right? This is the center of the
[02:54.240 --> 02:58.880]  Kremlin and the center of Russian economy and power. Here we are, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:58.880 --> 03:04.320]  in the year 2022, and everything else, quite frankly, pells in significance. Now, now, why is
[03:04.320 --> 03:09.360]  war already started? Why is war war coming? Because they're at the end of a currency bubble,
[03:09.360 --> 03:14.880]  made a big global emergency to be able to basically make us forget that this is a giant
[03:14.880 --> 03:21.040]  Ponzi scheme that makes Bernie Madoff and FDX and the tulip mania that, you know, happened
[03:21.040 --> 03:25.920]  hundreds of years ago, pale in significance. Do you hate America? No. You know, in fact,
[03:26.480 --> 03:30.320]  I know many names. I figure out we're sharing way more common.
[03:30.320 --> 03:39.440]  But America is very much similar. Look, it's the same size. If they have a, it's the same kind
[03:39.440 --> 03:44.320]  of this. And when you talk to them, there is nothing there even to be found. We are naturally,
[03:45.680 --> 03:52.320]  you know, born not to be enemies. And whenever there's conflict, it's elites, you know, every,
[03:52.960 --> 03:57.280]  you know, American, I met in a prison who is from rural area.
[03:57.280 --> 04:05.200]  It was very easy to deal with. She has no problem with Russia. And he was curious about Russia,
[04:05.200 --> 04:10.480]  despite all propaganda. They're losing their Christian values. They're losing their families.
[04:10.480 --> 04:14.960]  They're losing literally their countries. You'll be laying in your bed one night.
[04:14.960 --> 04:18.720]  We'll be driving down the highway after work. And there'll be big flashes.
[04:19.520 --> 04:24.480]  You see, and then 10 seconds later, your car is going to be overturned, probably on fire.
[04:24.480 --> 04:27.520]  And then life as you know, it's over. You won't get back to your family.
[04:28.160 --> 04:34.320]  There'll be mass starvation and death. And there'll be a new literal dark age with enough dust in
[04:34.320 --> 04:41.120]  the atmosphere to cause a mini ice age. And they estimate 7 billion people will die in a nuclear
[04:41.120 --> 04:47.280]  war. There'll be maybe 500 million left, which is what these death cult people fetish all day long.
[04:47.280 --> 04:53.840]  All right, we're kicking off the main line Thursday. We're on gas.
[04:55.520 --> 04:56.320]  Stay with us.

[05:53.040 --> 06:12.320]  now exclusively available at infowarstore.com with massive, massive sales.
[06:23.200 --> 06:38.320]  It's Alex Jones.
[06:38.320 --> 06:42.480]  We've got a very special guest, a lawyer that's gotten a whole bunch of whistleblowers, including
[06:42.480 --> 06:48.480]  Dr. Hoff, who's the head scientist at EcoHealth Alliance, to go public and expose the origins
[06:48.480 --> 06:53.440]  of COVID-19 and the fact that it's the UN global government plan to take over society,
[06:53.440 --> 06:57.680]  bringing a casual society and more. That's the third hour, and I'm not going to get into COVID
[06:57.680 --> 07:02.000]  and the huge developments, the minute to minute developments, until he's with us in the third
[07:02.000 --> 07:05.120]  hour. We've been doing a lot of coverage on that, but it is central and important.
[07:06.400 --> 07:12.640]  In the first two hours before he joins us, I want to open the phones up and take a ton of your calls
[07:12.640 --> 07:18.720]  on any subject, anything you want to raise. I love the wildcard, random nature of it, and so
[07:18.720 --> 07:22.640]  many interesting points get brought up. I'd obviously like you to call in as well, if you'd
[07:22.640 --> 07:27.040]  like, on some of the topics I'm going to raise, things that I think are important, but I'd really
[07:27.040 --> 07:32.240]  just relish some of the amazing calls we have. All the calls are good, but some are just
[07:32.240 --> 07:35.760]  over the top, amazing. And so we're going to have open phones throughout the broadcast
[07:35.760 --> 07:42.720]  here today. Let me tell you what we got on the plate. To say the Democratic Party, along with
[07:42.720 --> 07:49.680]  other globalists around the world, have a central tenet of sexualization and mutilation and targeting
[07:49.680 --> 07:55.680]  of children for destruction is an understatement. But man, they've had some congressional hearings.
[07:55.680 --> 08:00.160]  I've got like 15 clips here. I don't know how I'm going to get to them all, but they are insane.
[08:00.160 --> 08:05.520]  Pedophiles are good people. We shouldn't call them pedophiles. This is because they want to have sex
[08:05.520 --> 08:11.120]  with children. This is their coming out. They need to have access to your children. Maybe your
[08:11.120 --> 08:18.000]  children want to have sex with them. I mean, it is just even unbelievable for me how much
[08:18.000 --> 08:22.000]  they're trying to normalize it quickly, because they know at some point the Jeffrey Epstein list
[08:22.960 --> 08:28.400]  and other lists of pedophiles and governments coming out. So this is a desperate, desperate
[08:28.400 --> 08:35.920]  desensitization operation by this cult. And I want to hit that first here, coming up, starting
[08:35.920 --> 08:41.360]  at the next segment, and then go into your calls. They didn't just outlaw the oldest and arguably
[08:41.360 --> 08:45.840]  the largest. It's definitely the second largest church in Ukraine. That's the Ukrainian Orthodox
[08:45.840 --> 08:52.560]  Church that started Russia. It was Orthodox Christians led by Translates out to Slav the
[08:52.560 --> 08:58.960]  Wise a thousand years ago that held back the Huns and then the Muslims and the rest of them.
[08:58.960 --> 09:05.440]  And so Russian culture is founded in Ukraine. They have not just now banned those churches. They
[09:05.440 --> 09:11.920]  are now seizing the churches and their bank accounts and the property of those convents
[09:11.920 --> 09:17.520]  and monasteries. We have video of the military storming them, arresting the priests. I mean,
[09:17.520 --> 09:26.000]  this is just next level persecution on any scale. This is al-Qaeda type stuff. I mean, this is just
[09:26.800 --> 09:34.960]  really, really, really, really bad. When Mammet the Conqueror took over Constantinople
[09:36.480 --> 09:44.640]  500 something years ago and turned it into Istanbul, he didn't kill the Orthodox priests
[09:44.640 --> 09:53.360]  in people because they had respect for them. They didn't arrest them. That's going on today
[09:54.000 --> 10:02.480]  by the so-called Ukrainian government. It just over the top criminal, also over the top criminal.
[10:02.480 --> 10:07.520]  You know, they're getting rid of Title 42 that basically creates a totally open border.
[10:07.520 --> 10:14.800]  Senator Josh Hawley has said Biden doesn't want a border. That's true. We have that. This as
[10:14.800 --> 10:22.240]  share of Americans living paycheck to paycheck rises to 63% of homes. Here's how that's going
[10:22.240 --> 10:26.800]  to basically play out. I'm going to be laying that out. He got Elon Musk being stalked by
[10:26.800 --> 10:31.840]  Antifa type folks that have been stalking his young son and jumping on the hood of the car.
[10:31.840 --> 10:36.640]  Elon stood up to the reported man that was doing it and the left is saying this is a thought crime
[10:36.640 --> 10:44.960]  with the highest proportions that Elon is doing this. That's amazing. So we're going to be getting
[10:44.960 --> 10:56.000]  into all of that. We also have son of Pelosi's alleged attacker, David DePappe saying that his
[10:56.000 --> 11:02.480]  dad's a liberal and that his dad would never do this and that he believes his dad was lured to the
[11:02.480 --> 11:10.400]  house and was being held as a sex slave. And now we know that they're admitting Pelosi let
[11:10.400 --> 11:17.360]  the quote man in at his back door. So God knows if he was a for all we know, he could have been an
[11:17.360 --> 11:22.480]  Uber or something or Uber each delivery driver. Definitely a cover up going on there. That's
[11:22.480 --> 11:29.040]  now breaking son of Pelosi's alleged attacker has broken his silence and to believe that Democrats
[11:29.040 --> 11:33.920]  have sex slaves. That's like believing that bears live in the woods and fish swim in the sea and
[11:33.920 --> 11:39.760]  birds fly in the air and that all the Democratic Party are perverts. So we're going to be breaking
[11:39.760 --> 11:44.720]  all of that down here today. And I meant to get to this yesterday. I knew about it three days ago,
[11:45.760 --> 11:50.080]  but it really is important. So at some point, I'm going to air about a six minute clip with
[11:50.080 --> 11:55.120]  Tulsi Gabbards on her show with Tucker Carlson on the broadcast. I think I'm going to get Tucker
[11:55.120 --> 12:00.080]  on my show. He's been on a few times trying to get Tucker back on. And he talked about his dad,
[12:01.680 --> 12:07.600]  who obviously wasn't just the head of Voice of America, but a lot of other stuff. And how the
[12:07.600 --> 12:13.520]  government knows who he is and how he was secretly listed as a Russian asset to be harassed. And
[12:13.520 --> 12:17.200]  bad things happened. And he got really pissed off. And it just shows what they've done to a lot of
[12:17.200 --> 12:23.040]  people. They've done this to me, saying that I must be a Russian agent. So I deserved all the
[12:23.040 --> 12:27.120]  disinformation attacks on us. No, it's the globalists. They're destroying America. They're
[12:27.120 --> 12:35.200]  the anti Americans. That's all going to be coming up today as well. And so much more crime is
[12:35.200 --> 12:44.160]  exploding. There's just all of this intense insanity. There are now caravans of 14,000 people a day
[12:45.440 --> 12:52.480]  slamming into just one South Texas town. Imagine what this is like. We've got videos of
[12:52.480 --> 13:00.240]  that. And this this country is being dissolved. This this this nation is being completely destroyed
[13:00.240 --> 13:05.360]  from within. And the globalists are just getting started. Obviously, they stole the election. All
[13:05.360 --> 13:11.440]  the polls show the American people are against us. And by the time we wake up to that, I really am
[13:11.440 --> 13:16.560]  concerned that it's going to be too late. But regardless, we continue fighting on knowing that
[13:16.560 --> 13:21.280]  submission and rolling over only make things worse. And God's watching what's about what we do,
[13:21.280 --> 13:24.560]  not even the outcome. It's about us doing the right thing. That's what life on this planet.
[13:24.560 --> 13:32.240]  It's about is that big test that God gives us. Now, that said, info wars is treading water.
[13:32.240 --> 13:36.560]  We're more influential than ever, but we're under massive attack and sustained demonization.
[13:36.560 --> 13:41.440]  And so much we are paying the bills, but just barely. And I really think everybody should go
[13:41.440 --> 13:45.520]  to info or store.com and get great products that empower your life and enrich your life at the
[13:45.520 --> 13:52.960]  same time, knowing you're keeping a light of liberty, a torch of liberty on fire that is key

[13:59.600 --> 14:05.840]  really see this as a key target to bring down. And I'm just telling listeners, it's a win-win
[14:05.840 --> 14:10.640]  scenario, go to info or store.com to get vitamin mineral fusion that's close to selling out DNA

[17:00.080 --> 17:07.520]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and guided
[17:07.520 --> 17:13.920]  many cases in the winter because of something called vapors. They associated these poisonous
[17:13.920 --> 17:19.680]  vapors with cold weather. Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed
[17:19.680 --> 17:27.360]  people. What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D three. You see the sun via your skin
[17:27.360 --> 17:32.720]  helps your body produce vitamin D three. But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not
[17:32.720 --> 17:37.600]  produce vitamin D three. And then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating
[17:37.600 --> 17:41.840]  and taking your body over. So now it's more important than ever because the winners here

[19:08.160 --> 19:12.720]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that this is the very best I can get?

[19:30.960 --> 19:39.120]  have you? And this little jewel right here is solid liquid consciousness.
[19:42.480 --> 19:50.080]  Look it up. Find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible. The
[19:50.080 --> 19:55.760]  number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil just like our
[19:55.760 --> 20:02.800]  informations dynamite store our products in four store dot com. Leading a frontal assault on the
[20:02.800 --> 20:06.720]  lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[20:16.320 --> 20:18.560]  Ah, the pedos are coming to town.
[20:18.560 --> 20:29.440]  Your children are mine. It's just a matter of time. And I'm not just gonna rape them.
[20:33.200 --> 20:40.480]  We're gonna cut off the breast. We're gonna cut off the balls. We're gonna kill, kill, kill them
[20:40.480 --> 20:53.200]  when they're small. Too many people. All right, let's get serious here.
[20:55.200 --> 21:01.760]  Dehumanization, sterilization, debt is the goal. And the trans movement, targeting children,
[21:02.320 --> 21:06.240]  taking away the parental rights, putting them on a fast track to be chemically or physically
[21:06.240 --> 21:13.200]  sterilized surgically is next level pedophilia. It's actually destroying their future, stealing
[21:13.200 --> 21:17.440]  their fertility, stunning their growth, giving them all sorts of serious health problems.
[21:18.800 --> 21:23.680]  This is the weaponization of the medical system. It's all directed the same whether you're in
[21:23.680 --> 21:29.520]  Australia or Germany or the United States or Canada. You're not taught reading, writing,
[21:29.520 --> 21:34.000]  and arithmetic. You're taught to take poison shots. You're taught to wear a mask. And you're taught
[21:34.000 --> 21:38.560]  by these organizations flooding the schools with pedophilic literature and all the rest of it that
[21:38.560 --> 21:42.560]  your kindergartners told they're going to be a different body. They're really a boy or they're
[21:42.560 --> 21:50.400]  really a girl. It is psychological warfare the next level. And we just sit here and put up with it
[21:50.400 --> 21:55.680]  when parents go and protest at the school boards, why the FBI is called, why that's terrorist.
[21:55.680 --> 22:05.200]  So here's Joe Biden saying anyone who criticizes surgeries that are performed on children
[22:06.720 --> 22:12.560]  is anti-semitic, racist, homophobic. It's all connected. Yeah, anybody that doesn't go along
[22:12.560 --> 22:18.880]  with your pro-death agenda is anti-semitic. Okay, so if I don't let the evil sick Department of
[22:18.880 --> 22:23.520]  Education run by the Carnegie Endowment and the CIA literally sterilized the children,
[22:23.520 --> 22:31.360]  then I'm bad. Here it is. Excuse me, because they support LGBTQ children and families,
[22:31.360 --> 22:37.600]  we have to speak out. We must stop the hate and violence like we just saw in Colorado Springs,
[22:38.240 --> 22:44.880]  where a place of acceptance and celebration was targeted for violence and terror. We needed
[22:44.880 --> 22:51.440]  to challenge the hundreds of callous, cynical laws introduced in the states targeting transgender
[22:51.440 --> 22:58.240]  children, terrifying families, and criminalizing doctors who give children the care they need.
[22:58.240 --> 23:04.400]  We have to protect these children so they know they're loved and we will stand up for them and
[23:04.400 --> 23:17.200]  say I can seek for themselves. Racism, anti-semitism, homophobia, transphobia, they're all connected.
[23:17.200 --> 23:25.360]  But the antidote to hate is love. This law and the love it defends strike a blow against hate
[23:25.360 --> 23:32.640]  in all its forms. And that's why this law matters to every single American, no matter who you are
[23:32.640 --> 23:39.440]  or who you love. This shouldn't be about conservative or liberal, red or blue. No, this is about
[23:39.440 --> 23:45.280]  realizing the promise of the Declaration of Independence, a promise rooted in a sacred and
[23:45.280 --> 23:51.120]  secular beliefs, a promise that we're all created equal.
[23:52.880 --> 23:56.000]  Wow, he could actually talk a little bit there because he gets so excited when talking about
[23:56.000 --> 24:00.400]  children. His daughter said she had sex with him in the shower, but that's okay. That's love,
[24:00.400 --> 24:05.920]  right? A celebration. Let us have access to your children. Let us unannounced have a drag queen
[24:05.920 --> 24:10.720]  pet pedo time at your public school or library. Let us give your children books showing them
[24:10.720 --> 24:16.080]  children having sex with adults or you're not loving, you're not good. Turns out the guy that
[24:16.080 --> 24:23.120]  shot up the bar, and it's no longer just a gay bar. It had, you know, weird stuff going on with
[24:23.120 --> 24:29.920]  kids there that shot up the sex pervert center. And I'm not glad they got shot up,
[24:31.200 --> 24:36.160]  but it should be investigated. All of this should be, was an isosympathizer who'd been a leftist.
[24:36.160 --> 24:46.160]  So again, oh, let us have access to your kids. And if you don't let us, why you're causing
[24:46.160 --> 24:52.320]  violence against us. And that's what they say in these congressional hearings that go on and on
[24:52.320 --> 25:01.120]  and on saying you can't call people pedos. That's a mean term just because they want to have access
[25:01.120 --> 25:05.280]  to your children. And even if they don't want to have sex with them, they want to scroll them up
[25:05.280 --> 25:12.160]  and tell them there's something else and make them obsessed on becoming a boy when they're a girl
[25:12.160 --> 25:20.800]  or a girl when they're a boy or vice versa. Absolutely evil. And we know what it is. It's
[25:20.800 --> 25:25.920]  the transhumanist agenda to get us ready for microchips and human animal clones and all this
[25:25.920 --> 25:30.560]  stuff being rolled out. And they take little children to the quote gay pride parades that are
[25:30.560 --> 25:38.480]  now nothing but giant, pedophilic sexual baptisms of the children into a totally destructive lifestyle.
[25:38.480 --> 25:43.040]  And then all these leftist adopt children now or have children. And you'll see statistically
[25:43.040 --> 25:48.160]  in areas like Seattle and other areas, a third of the children are transgender in a decade.
[25:48.160 --> 25:52.000]  Oh, you're all transgender now. And the parents like it's an attention getter.
[25:52.720 --> 25:59.600]  Though, oh, yes, our daughter at two knew she was a boy or our son at three knew he was a girl.
[25:59.600 --> 26:03.440]  And now you the head of Planned Parenthood saying no, in congressional testimony last month,
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.280]  children know when they're born and only the special high priest of transgenderism
[26:09.280 --> 26:14.080]  can come in and say this is really a girl or this is really a boy. And then they start that in the
[26:14.080 --> 26:20.480]  file that follows your child. So they're targeted, put in special classes, cut out from the rest of
[26:20.480 --> 26:25.440]  the kids and destroy it. I had a member of parliament on who's actually a liberal like a decade ago
[26:25.440 --> 26:33.200]  talking about in England that is the most advanced in this evil that in England, over half the kids
[26:33.200 --> 26:38.720]  that they are sterilizing are autistic or mentally retarded. So really, you see, they're doing us a
[26:38.720 --> 26:44.160]  favor, they're getting rid of the infirm. But if you sterilize people like eugenics did in this
[26:44.160 --> 26:50.080]  country in the UK and Germany, by the millions before World War Two, the US and England led it.
[26:50.080 --> 26:55.360]  Hitler learned all he knew from us from the health department set up about 120 years ago
[26:55.360 --> 27:00.000]  in New York and other major cities. Those health departments would go out and grab people who had
[27:00.000 --> 27:05.200]  B pluses, but were from single parent homes. If you had a B plus, there's even PBS documentaries
[27:05.200 --> 27:10.160]  back when they thought something this was wrong in the 80s and 90s about the last state to even
[27:10.160 --> 27:18.160]  stop doing this in the mid 80s was what, what, what Washington State and Oregon until the 80s,
[27:18.160 --> 27:23.840]  they were still grabbing 12, 13 year old boys and girls, black, white, you name it, but poor,
[27:23.840 --> 27:30.720]  and taking them and not just stepping their tubes, not just giving them vasectomies,
[27:31.840 --> 27:40.480]  but with girls removing their uteruses. And boy, they do it sloppily too. It's in the back of a clinic
[27:41.040 --> 27:46.320]  at the health department. Imagine the sick freaks that like doing that because they see us as
[27:46.320 --> 27:54.080]  stray dogs or stray cats. While they bring in the low educated, half starved to death, third world
[27:54.080 --> 27:59.360]  populations that they cut the food off, they then flood us with those folks while they bombard
[27:59.360 --> 28:05.280]  who's already in the country with sterilization. This is all eugenics repackaged and you've got
[28:05.280 --> 28:10.720]  an army of pedophiles that want access to kids, but those above them just want to sterilize them
[28:10.720 --> 28:17.200]  and have total control over our bodies. And just like the poison shots are a crime against humanity
[28:17.200 --> 28:23.600]  and violate the Nuremberg Code, all of this is flagrant, giant, massive crimes happening out
[28:23.600 --> 28:31.280]  of the open hiding behind their medical badges. The worst tyranny in the Soviet Union first came
[28:31.280 --> 28:36.960]  from the medical doctors and psychiatry. The worst tyranny in Germany first started from the medical
[28:36.960 --> 28:43.040]  doctors and psychiatry. It's in the textbooks, it's in the history, and they're doing it again.
[28:43.840 --> 28:47.760]  They're taking people's kids in Brazil. The left is who were part of the protest, saying it's
[28:47.760 --> 28:52.320]  mentally ill to protest Lula. They're saying you don't take your shots, you're mentally ill,
[28:52.320 --> 28:56.880]  and causing more car wrecks. It's all made up criminal crap by this death cult.
[28:59.680 --> 29:04.720]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow info warriors here in the United States

[33:29.200 --> 33:34.080]  so we have international statistics from around the world of leftist populations they are the most
[33:34.080 --> 33:43.840]  alone they are the most in debt they are the most depressed they statistically rob and steal seven
[33:43.840 --> 33:50.000]  to nine times more often they give the lowest levels of charity but they virtue signal many
[33:50.000 --> 33:53.840]  many times more than the conservatives or christians that they are giving to charity
[33:55.040 --> 34:01.760]  they're idiots and i don't look at these masses of dumbed-down schmucks and feel superior oh look
[34:01.760 --> 34:06.160]  they're a bunch of idiots and i'm not i feel horrible because they've been organized into
[34:06.160 --> 34:13.440]  giant zombie-like mobs of evil ladies and gentlemen you know Planned Parenthood was
[34:13.440 --> 34:19.120]  set up by the Rockefellers and helped set up Adolf Hitler on record that came out in the Nuremberg
[34:19.120 --> 34:25.600]  trials you know Planned Parenthood's job was set up to kill mainly black people that's in their
[34:25.600 --> 34:36.160]  founding documents and charter that's mainline news look it up you know that they are set up
[34:36.160 --> 34:41.600]  with british intelligence who first hatched the plan in the 60s the taba stock institute
[34:43.200 --> 34:48.960]  to sell sterilizing children as a cool thing by taking away parental consent and tricking the
[34:48.960 --> 34:54.000]  children to think it's fun to be sterilized that you become a superhero just like oh take the covid
[34:54.000 --> 35:01.440]  shot you'll become a superhero remember all those ads so now they brag that just in the first year
[35:01.440 --> 35:07.760]  of a transgender operation on a girl just getting them into the system in age seven starting puberty
[35:07.760 --> 35:11.760]  blockers and the counseling they make twenty thousand dollars because there's government funding
[35:11.760 --> 35:18.160]  state and federal and corporate and they estimate that by the time that person graduates high school
[35:18.160 --> 35:25.920]  and has either been chemically or medically surgically transitioned into a unit they're not
[35:25.920 --> 35:33.280]  really a man now they're not really a woman now they're a unit that they will make wait for it
[35:34.320 --> 35:41.840]  over half a million dollars on that person remember it's a fifty one thousand dollar bounty
[35:41.840 --> 35:49.520]  to incubate intubate not incubate not put an egg in incubator to intubate somebody
[35:50.800 --> 35:56.400]  and even more if they die so these are bounties in the medical system and most medical systems
[35:56.400 --> 35:59.680]  won't be part of it but they're all going to be phased out because they can't compete with
[35:59.680 --> 36:04.240]  all the money that the big medical centers and systems get whether you're in australia or whether
[36:04.240 --> 36:08.000]  you're in france or whether you're in canada or whether you're in the u.s or whether you're in
[36:08.000 --> 36:15.200]  austra texas or new york city it is the same global policies that are setting and directing
[36:15.200 --> 36:21.520]  this the same brochures the same language a different name on the brochure a different
[36:21.520 --> 36:29.840]  foundation a different government agency but it's all centralized and it wants to convince little
[36:29.840 --> 36:35.760]  girls to have their breasts cut off angelo lina joe lee pushes it for the u.n and to have little
[36:35.760 --> 36:40.800]  boys testicles and penises cut off and then when they complain later and say i didn't want this to
[36:40.800 --> 36:46.560]  happen i'm 15 now and they cut it off when i was 11 i can never get it back i'm suing they say sorry
[36:47.520 --> 36:53.840]  we're passing indemnity and liability protection you really are a girl sorry we cut your penis off
[36:53.840 --> 37:02.640]  and threw it in a trash bag imagine 10 years ago if you'd hear the occasional story of a crazy psycho
[37:02.640 --> 37:07.120]  they would kidnap a kid and cut their genitals off or a crazy dad would or mom would do it and
[37:07.120 --> 37:16.880]  they'd give them the death penalty and we see all these cases around the world from brazil
[37:16.880 --> 37:22.000]  to the united states where particularly lesbian couples and i'm not saying all lesbians are bad
[37:22.000 --> 37:31.040]  people i'm saying that's the statistics adopt little boys and then start torturing them to death
[37:31.040 --> 37:37.200]  before they cut their genitals off and slit their throats and every time i talk about that on the
[37:37.200 --> 37:42.080]  media matters article jones claims lesbians are doing this you can go pull it all up but hell
[37:43.280 --> 37:44.000]  you know why
[37:48.880 --> 37:53.920]  one of our reporters a few years ago quit working here it's because they couldn't work here anymore
[37:53.920 --> 37:59.520]  and and be around this anymore and it was because their sister i'm not gonna say it's a man or woman
[37:59.520 --> 38:05.920]  their sister's a nurse in houston and over and over and over again and by the way her sister was a
[38:05.920 --> 38:16.880]  liberal over and over again i said i wouldn't say the sex came to them and lesbian couples would
[38:16.880 --> 38:22.880]  demand that they set up a surgery to cut their three four five and six year olds penises and
[38:22.880 --> 38:28.640]  testicles off and look i don't blame people not be able to handle this and fight this and and and
[38:28.640 --> 38:32.720]  deal with us and have to just leave the big city and go move to a small town somewhere sounds great
[38:35.360 --> 38:40.240]  but they're going to come get us in our small towns they're never going to go away until we

[45:10.720 --> 45:17.760]  to take our election seriously when we we just it's election month alex it's not election day
[45:17.760 --> 45:24.000]  and that's the problem and everything changed after covet nineteen they illegally changed
[45:24.000 --> 45:30.160]  state elections uh mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple
[45:30.160 --> 45:35.120]  ballots to people well this isn't any way to run an election we're in a serious country when we
[45:35.120 --> 45:40.320]  have elections that can be stolen like this and i believe that just like i believe the election
[45:40.320 --> 45:46.080]  was stolen in 2020 and i have no problem saying that and it's it is so absurd for the media and
[45:46.080 --> 45:52.240]  the democrats to attack us that that question our election integrity and question the the fact that
[45:52.240 --> 45:58.480]  elections shouldn't be run the way they are we're not election deniers we're election realists

[47:06.480 --> 47:24.080]  it's all rolled out with superbly executed psychological warfare just like you put the
[47:24.080 --> 47:29.440]  frog in the pot of cold water so they turn the heat up and they will sit there until they die
[47:29.440 --> 47:36.240]  you throw a frog into boiling hot water it jumps right out but it was at first oh let's just be
[47:36.240 --> 47:41.680]  nice to gay people oh let's just allow gay marriage come on let's be friendly let's show we're open
[47:41.680 --> 47:48.320]  okay hey let us teach your kids about tolerance hey let us talk to your child about maybe they're
[47:48.320 --> 47:53.600]  a different sex let's sign them up with the local planned parenthood or other organization to take
[47:53.600 --> 47:58.240]  control of their reproductive future and then make sure they don't have children let's make it popular
[47:58.240 --> 48:06.160]  and cool just to sterilize them and so you had katelyn Jenner and all these people the last decade
[48:06.160 --> 48:11.280]  as heroes is stunning and brave that all just cranked up the last decade and well okay he's a
[48:11.280 --> 48:15.600]  famous olympian he wants to be a woman you know what stunning and brave we're not against you
[48:16.720 --> 48:20.640]  a rich man wants to say he's a woman and put lipstick on and do his hair i don't want to hurt
[48:20.640 --> 48:27.840]  that guy i don't hate that guy i'm not his enemy just don't get around children and now katelyn
[48:27.840 --> 48:36.640]  Jenner agrees with that but but bruce Jenner was only used to get us to accept that so we would accept
[48:36.640 --> 48:42.480]  the next increment and the next increment and the next increment and the next increment the most
[48:42.480 --> 48:47.520]  conservative societies come out of times of incredible decadence and the people that establish
[48:47.520 --> 48:52.000]  those societies don't establish him because they haven't seen it or done it or been around the
[48:52.000 --> 48:57.840]  block hunter times they know how incredibly destructive it is and how it's a slippery slope and now
[48:57.840 --> 49:04.400]  we're here and it's being done by design by big corporations to get us into artificial wombs make
[49:04.400 --> 49:11.920]  all women have cesareans make humans being biologically independent obsolete that's their
[49:11.920 --> 49:19.440]  admitted holy grail that's not our opinion and so you see the head of the young turk saying
[49:19.440 --> 49:24.800]  he believes that bestiality is a good thing and that he would like to you know pleasure animals
[49:24.800 --> 49:30.880]  if he was the dictator of the world he would pass a law that he would you know have a special
[49:30.880 --> 49:37.760]  bureau that oversaw the animals and made sure that it was only giving the donkeys and the horses
[49:37.760 --> 49:42.480]  and the cats and the dog's pleasure but by the way if you're a new listener i'm not joking about
[49:42.480 --> 49:48.800]  that and you ask yourself well why is he saying that because that's what's encouraged if you'll
[49:48.800 --> 49:55.520]  accept a creepy dude on tv talking about pleasuring donkeys or sheep and getting really excited about
[49:55.520 --> 50:03.120]  it you will accept anything so now they're in congress saying well of course we've got to be
[50:03.120 --> 50:07.840]  nice to people that are minor attractive persons don't call them pedos that's a new hate word
[50:09.040 --> 50:14.000]  and groomers don't call it that because that's what they're doing is they're grooming it and
[50:14.000 --> 50:21.360]  you look at hollywood something like 20 of the super couples their boys are girls their girls
[50:21.360 --> 50:27.600]  are boys and they think it's so cool and so avant garde and the hollywood stars you know
[50:28.880 --> 50:33.760]  the new hot stars that are you know we're making money why they dress up as women and walk down
[50:33.760 --> 50:38.320]  the red carpet and it's so cool it's so great but all of our real rights are being taken we're
[50:38.320 --> 50:43.840]  being bathed in 5g we're being chemtrail we're eating gmo food they're pushing poison shots on us
[50:43.840 --> 50:49.280]  but don't worry we're free because we'll pay for a 10 year old to have their genitals cut off or
[50:49.280 --> 50:57.760]  their breasts cut off and that's what they've done so let me give the number out for the next hour

[51:25.600 --> 51:28.800]  me start getting these clips because I mentioned them and you just got to see these for yourself
[51:29.840 --> 51:33.600]  we just played Vanderbilt saying how we make 40 grand cutting girl girls breasts off
[51:33.600 --> 51:43.840]  at our hospital here let's go ahead and play a clip let's play somebody countering it
[51:43.840 --> 51:52.880]  this is an anti-woke immigrant mother ashira noani calls out lepister faces at house oversight
[51:52.880 --> 51:58.480]  committee let's play that here it is so my name is astro no money I came to the United States at
[51:58.480 --> 52:04.640]  the age of four I was an immigrant to the great state of New Jersey and I grew up in morgantown
[52:04.640 --> 52:14.160]  west virginia a mostly white state I was affirmed I was supported and I was able to grow up a girl
[52:14.160 --> 52:18.640]  who knew not a word of English when I arrived to become a reporter for the wall street journal
[52:19.440 --> 52:27.760]  I am sitting here before you today apparently the face of white supremacy I am wearing a shirt
[52:27.760 --> 52:35.600]  that my father made my father survived literally white supremacy in India my father is five foot
[52:35.600 --> 52:42.400]  three because when he was a boy the white supremacists that were the British rule in India
[52:43.200 --> 52:52.080]  literally funnels food away from the people of India and my father starved and so he grew up
[52:52.080 --> 52:58.800]  to be a young man who came to the United States of America because he believed in the values
[52:58.800 --> 53:05.280]  and principles of this great nation my father made this shirt for me inspired by the gown that
[53:05.920 --> 53:14.080]  representative of casio-cortez wore to the Met Gala and it says on here the names that we the
[53:14.080 --> 53:19.920]  parents in the United States of America have been called including in the video that you featured
[53:19.920 --> 53:28.720]  chairman raskin things like domestic terrorist white supremacist QAnon moms what is it that we
[53:28.720 --> 53:34.560]  the parents have dared to stand up against in the United States of America over the last couple
[53:34.560 --> 53:42.480]  years it is a divisive ideology expressed through this book called critical race theory it is a
[53:42.480 --> 53:49.440]  book that is taught in law schools but it is translated into our school systems with books
[53:49.440 --> 53:58.960]  like this not my idea a book about whiteness the trickle down effect of the demonization of any
[53:58.960 --> 54:06.080]  human being because of their race is books like this where does this book take us as an idea it
[54:06.080 --> 54:15.760]  takes us to this very simple idea an idea that is a new hierarchy of human value there is no doubt
[54:15.760 --> 54:23.040]  that the hierarchy of human value that was about white supremacy is illegitimate every single person
[54:23.040 --> 54:29.920]  is opposed to the idea of white supremacy but we cannot replace an old hierarchy of human value
[54:29.920 --> 54:37.600]  with a new hierarchy of human value that demonizes children with this book whiteness is a bad deal
[54:37.600 --> 54:45.840]  signing a contract with the devil what is the message in this the message is the shaming of
[54:45.840 --> 54:52.400]  human beings no child should be shamed and why is this a threat to our democracy because we then
[54:52.400 --> 55:00.320]  have posters like this one in the los angeles school district what does it say f america with
[55:00.320 --> 55:10.000]  kkk replacing the c because the idea is that our nation has become a white supremacist nation
[55:10.000 --> 55:16.400]  and that is not true that is not the reality and we can see exhibited here today this
[55:17.600 --> 55:26.240]  poster also f the police this is an ideology that i call the woke army it is an ideology of
[55:26.240 --> 55:32.800]  activists who are going through america's school districts and our communities and what they are
[55:32.800 --> 55:38.960]  doing is a threat to democracy what is the greatest threat that our children face today
[55:39.920 --> 55:46.400]  it is the learning loss that has happened in our school districts the department of justice
[55:46.400 --> 55:54.000]  declares clearly the characteristics that lead any human being to extremism include
[55:54.000 --> 56:00.880]  having less education chairman raskin i don't know if you know it but the reading level in your
[56:00.880 --> 56:06.480]  school district in montgomery county schools is at 32 percent of kids that are reading at
[56:06.480 --> 56:15.280]  at grade level math is at 30 percent congressman congresswoman talib is here in detroit it's 18
[56:15.280 --> 56:22.160]  percent and then 12 percent for math it is a failure this is a system failure white supremacy
[56:22.160 --> 56:29.600]  must be defeated as must all extremism this is our mandate as adults for our children
[56:30.320 --> 56:37.440]  our children are in a crisis today and the idea that we the parents are now the agents of white
[56:37.440 --> 56:44.400]  supremacy is unacceptable all of these books that i have here today are the indoctrination
[56:44.400 --> 56:50.160]  that are being put into the minds of our children instead of the fundamentals that are critical
[56:50.160 --> 56:57.200]  to make them educated enlightened citizens that protect our democracy that is our greatest mandate
[56:57.200 --> 57:02.400]  and it goes on the full video i am is on info wars dot com but but the point is she's acting
[57:02.400 --> 57:08.640]  like they don't know because she's not evil and she has all the other books pushing pedophilia

[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:28.560]  about the violence and we can't let people criticize sterilizing children or taking
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:33.200]  kids away from their parents and you still live with your parents but the state now controls
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:37.120]  the cult you're in and and puts you on the transgender cult and then starts you on puberty
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:42.080]  blockers that are so toxic and then finally starts cutting body parts off i mean it's just
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:47.280]  all peer pressure they want to intimidate us to go along with it and just submit to it but we're
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:55.840]  not going to so let's go to some of these clips uh here is uh one of the key clips here uh this is
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:03.680]  anti-lgbt violence at the hearing misuse of the term groomer on social media is leading to violence
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:09.680]  here it is already receptive to that message take it to heart and it reinforces their prejudices
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:14.000]  in their minds trans people either become victims to be saved from ourselves or villains to be
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:20.160]  punished one example of this in action is the misuse of the term groomer anti-lgbtq activists
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:25.280]  have appropriated this terminology used by survivors of childhood sexual abuse and used it to slander
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:31.200]  lgbtq people and our allies as predatory harmful toward children in reality trans people are
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:36.000]  significantly more likely to be the victims of sexuality use than perpetrators of it and now
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.640]  this misuse terminology has become part of the political discourse around trans people and is
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:45.200]  invoked as a reason to further restrict our rights in the name of protecting children oh yeah that's
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:50.800]  enough i can't look at it anymore the point is is that give us access to your children let them
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:58.880]  brainwash them or you're causing violence absolutely insane it's hard to watch this stuff
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:06.000]  his representative katie porter democrat california says that groomer and pedophile terms are bad and
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.040]  should be gotten rid of so they want to ban new words describe what grooming of children is here
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:18.000]  it is the allegation of groomer and pedophile it is alleging that a person is criminal somehow
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:24.720]  an engaged in criminal acts merely because of of their identity um pause started over started
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:31.440]  over to start listen this is all about these systems coming into the schools with literature
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:36.800]  and they're high priests that dress like clowns usually big fat giant men saying fat man dressed
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:42.160]  like a clown as a woman so these these these these killer clowns come in and they want access to your
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:47.920]  children and they're doing horrible things and i've got a whole stack of news here with california
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:53.040]  schools putting on sex parties with kids at the schools i mean it's just insane we all see what's
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:59.280]  going on we all know what's going on and they're saying oh you're being violent to trans people
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:04.080]  because you don't want them grooming kids no we call groomers people that say we're gonna
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:10.960]  groom your children we're gonna recruit your children we are grooming the next generation
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:18.240]  you know where people got the term groomer this show i'm credited by the enemy of saying it's
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:24.000]  transhumanism and its depopulation for 20 years and in the last decade i played clip after clip
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.880]  here i'm not trying to get credit for no reason it's no we're successful at telling the truth
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:36.640]  and i have countless clips countless compilations that we've aired in fact last time i checked just
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:44.720]  the last two years we got five compilations of the groomers and why do we call them groomers they go
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:53.920]  in louisiana and texas in new york and in california we have all these clips and it's men
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:59.280]  dressed like clowns it's a cult and they say we're here to groom the next generation your
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:06.800]  children are ours we're going to get them the san francisco lgbt mens choir all of it we're

[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:20.560]  and piss on each other in front of two-year-olds i mean i can show you all the footage folks
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:25.680]  but our radio our tv stations that carry us will not allow it and i agree with them adults should
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:31.520]  not be watching this on broadcast or cable tv but i can show you hours of men having sex and
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:38.080]  defecating on the ground and peeing on each other in front of little kids hours of it without even
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:44.000]  looking for it it's everywhere as it's the best things in slice bread children can be shown this
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.400]  but it can't be on television i said i'd go to your calls and i'm just ranting
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:57.120]  it's just the total misrepresentation of this this is pedophilic it is destroying children

[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:32.240]  steal what a woman is sam grenton who's now been indicted for stealing all this expensive luggage
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:40.240]  and now been booked in we've got his uh he's got his disguise off now he's not trying to dress like
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:48.880]  a woman we've got his mug shot he was in charge of crafting model school policy keeping parents in
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:56.560]  the dark about kids gender changes and in fact let's play clip one right now a witness at the
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:06.000]  house hearing on anti-lgbtqp uh violence that's for pedophile uh said that parents have no right
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.240]  to know including their elementary students if their children are going through sex changes
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:16.480]  at the age of consent but they want to lower the age of consent down to 10 and that's what the
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:21.520]  non-profit is pushing but they're targeting elementary students and it came out in california
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:25.920]  other states not tell parents when the elementary students are being indoctrinated this is beyond
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:33.120]  criminal here's the club person is safe and protected we have uh we are constantly filing
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:39.440]  reports of abuse and neglect because of parents i understand the cases of it sounds like you're
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:44.640]  deflecting the question a little bit uh i understand cases of abuse there's laws to protect
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:49.840]  by the way hit pause i mean school back back to sub yeah it's abuse or neglect all over the world
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:54.800]  they take children from parents as young as five if they tell their five-year-old daughter or son
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:59.920]  no the school shouldn't tell you you're another sex that's wrong then they take the children from them
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:10.400]  this is a damn cult people started over is safe and protected we have uh we are constantly filing
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:16.560]  reports of abuse and neglect because of parents i understand the cases of people it sounds like
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:22.000]  you're deflecting the question a little bit uh i understand cases of abuse there's laws to protect
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:26.800]  the abuse i mean schools actually are legally obligated to report cases of abuse same for
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:33.040]  churches and and the like anyone who deals with young people but you know do parents have a
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:38.400]  right should they be informed about what's going on do they have a right to know what's going on
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:46.560]  in their kids lives so i think again those of us who are protecting and supporting young people are
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:52.160]  there and trusted with the information of the things that they're they're there they're trusted
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:57.040]  the parents aren't she looks like the prime minister of new zealand doesn't she just a rubber face a
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:03.040]  demon up there just arrogantly knowing she's got the full backing of the fortune 500 the banks the
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:07.440]  governments the media coming for your kids coming for your medical freedom coming for your bodies
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:14.880]  here it is in terms of parents rights to know at schools i mean here in colorado parents don't have
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:22.240]  the right if a young person is questioning their gender or their sexuality their laws in place that
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:27.680]  say that they have the right to process that with their trusted counselor and so forth you do a
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:34.240]  significant amount of your work with kids even starting at age 13 uh what what would be the age
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:40.560]  of consent then in your in your mind uh in our community the age of consent to mental health
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:46.640]  therapy is 12 years old so we have laws that enable young people to connect with trusted adults who
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:52.480]  can support them that is just so important it prevents suicide and so we serve young people
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:59.680]  at 13 because we know they come to us they're all freaks folks they all got that same jaws smile
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:07.440]  Sam Brenton all of them it's a clown cult they're not human anymore folks they've given into the
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:19.200]  dark side unbelievably evil absolutely disgusting all right i'm gonna start going to your phone
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:22.640]  calls i love your calls i'm gonna give each person about two minutes because we got to get to the

[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:33.520]  quarry in wyoming you're on the air go ahead yes alex i wanted to propose the idea of information
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:40.320]  art to you as a way to do some fundraising um if you could do like a bob ross once a week
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:47.280]  painting and then kind of paste on undeniable facts into the art as well do you like a 24 by 36
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:53.760]  um do like a Fauci do a cloche swab and just put all their quotes up there and do it at alex
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:25:01.920]  jones original art painting with it and then sell it for a profit um don't do pre-order it just uh
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:06.720]  have a printer do a drop ship for you so you're not holding on to it no i one trillion percent
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:12.400]  agree i've been wanting for decades and bob ross is exactly the model where i would sit there
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:22.240]  and talk for like five minutes in part of the time i'm painting and then also have that be a digital
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:29.280]  discussion about the piece of art and then maybe have each painting be one of a hundred and then
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:33.520]  and then have a hundred that are drop ship from a printer you are everybody's been requesting it
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:40.720]  it's the way to go and i totally agree with you yes um not even a original just do reprints of it
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:45.200]  too so everybody can have that piece of that's what i'm saying is is is you'll have the original
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:49.200]  and then like a hundred prints and we have a new one every week and everybody's been requesting
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:53.440]  it and it could fund the operation you are absolutely right that is what i want to do next
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:59.680]  thank you so much because people uh into the future they can destroy all your digital work but
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:06.640]  if we have these posters of undeniable truth on them into the future even it could last uh through
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:12.480]  an EMP attack your book is fantastic on that i agree and then also have maybe a paragraph statement
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:19.280]  at the bottom of each painting yes um but people will love to see it and see you do the art and
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:25.600]  then have it on their wall as well and this it could easily last way further into the future than
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:31.840]  any of your digital information and and just put their put their own clothes up there just paste
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:37.520]  it on there with a piece of paper or something you know like and and just and do it nice soft

[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:42.400]  material is being like prepped for a different culture than christianity and also with like
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:48.640]  Weinstein and epstein connections how epstein had the breeding and cloning ranch oh yeah they're
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:53.440]  totally getting issues to clones and animal humans and trans this and men can have babies
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:59.920]  and oh now corporations are making humanoids and chimeras absolutely they're just blasting out
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:06.560]  everything where we will accept anything yeah and connected overall to a greater depopulation and
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:11.760]  removal of christianity you can see the war in russia how it's been amping up where according to
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:18.480]  russian military they have allocated over 145 billion dollars just for next year and that's
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:24.000]  with russian military equipment which is one third to one sixth the cost plus stuff has been amping
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:31.440]  up in the Balkans between Kosovo and Serbia where the muslim Kosovo people have been going into
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:38.080]  serbian christian orthodox areas and fighting and alex soros is down there importing from afghanistan
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:44.560]  muslims absolutely that's all on record soros as usual trying to overthrow russia and you know
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:50.160]  russia is close with Serbia because of the orthodoxy and i could imagine nato and europe at large and
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:55.840]  even america yeah what do you make i've actually got the articles right here uh overhead shot
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:03.680]  biden sending us trips to ukraine to quote track weapons yeah right under orders of Zelensky
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:08.400]  ukraine seizes the assets of clerics the russian orthodox church once he justified the raids of
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:13.760]  seizures by declaring we will never allow anyone to build an empire inside ukrainian soil so the
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:19.760]  orthodox church founded ukraine over a thousand years ago but now that's going on big breakdowns
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:25.600]  on that here's a u.s. news and world report ukraine orders punitive measures on clerics with
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:31.200]  moscow links the raiding of the churches and taking the churches over and our media is putting up
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:39.920]  with it absolutely insane and you know the orthodox church is by numbers the largest single amount of
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:48.080]  christians and you know it's a very large group of people worldwide and it seems like it's spreading
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:54.400]  um to you know a general overall war with christianity as you can see here stateside you know with
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:37:03.200]  all the um antichrist uh stuff anti-bible stuff uh being spread satanic stuff yeah it did funny

[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.840]  we're being taught that we are a commodity brother and if we let them turn us into a
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:36.160]  commodity we are a commodity but again our children don't deserve it uh how do how do we

[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:15.760]  hospitalizations all a lie and remember people like steve and cobert get their talking points
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:19.760]  directly from the democrats of deep state they are aiding and abetting this and when there's a
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:25.920]  nirnberg to steven cobert should be hauled up on charges all right nick in ohio go ahead
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:35.440]  hey alec um actually prayed about talking about um so i've went down an interesting rabbit hole
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:41.920]  concerning our currency um as you know you know it's made by three nations give me a
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:48.080]  favorite talk right on your telephone okay can you hear me now yeah go ahead okay concerning
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:52.800]  our currency though this is i got something to add to this after this but if you fold it into a
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:40:00.800]  certain way you know it's the towers the towers falling and so on if you fold a hundred dollars
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:11.600]  they'll be to a certain way it's a fixed way going through building and i've uh found an article
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:21.120]  on fox news concerning a russian submarine that has a drone capable of generating a uh
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:26.080]  uh uh radiated nuclear wave tsunami waves
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:33.600]  yeah that's been out for a while that you can detonate nuclear weapons or hydrogen bombs
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:40.240]  at key areas where there's a certain slope up to the beach where you can then generate it where
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:47.520]  it causes a massive tsunami yeah now the reason i mentioned this is because of the escalating
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:54.640]  war in ukraine that we are a part of now we're the ones sending weapons we're the ones sending money
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:41:02.880]  and everything i try to put myself in hooten shoes you know looking at us and you know we
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:09.040]  i see the culture war going on pedophilia that we talked about it is you know it's a culture
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:17.600]  that's trying to it's things like use the uh lgpq culture as an umbrella for it for its infiltration
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:23.600]  just this my this is just my observation now i hear you it's only a matter of time where things
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:28.400]  escalate boots talking about using nuclear weapons now this is out of control thank you nick
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:34.880]  franando in south carolina go ahead hey yes uh shout out to the products you know they're already

[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:46.480]  well at least we can use the products to sort of give us a heads of protection on us well let me
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:51.840]  explain that if your body has deficiencies not just the main line vitamins and minerals and things
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:57.440]  but trace elements it can't repair itself and and and so show me the problems are deficiencies that's
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:03.520]  why with the debase food debase stuff everybody should be supplementing with the best supplements

[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:12.880]  to the very heights of politics not just in america but in the world we are engaging the
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:18.880]  globalist at point blank range in the information war but i don't deserve the credit yes i've
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:24.080]  persevered but the listeners and viewers who support info wars for the real reason we've
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:29.760]  had the success we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order

[01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:41.840]  more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:47.920]  efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them god bless you all i salute you i thank you
[01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:52.800]  and i beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:59.840]  three is happening the fight is my fight it's your fight it's our fight god bless you all so when i
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:05.280]  first started taking survival skill basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i had brain fog
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:10.320]  like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard dr group on your show and i
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:14.800]  listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival shield the x1 and it worked
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:18.640]  pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that you had you know with a deep
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:23.280]  burden source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it and man in two weeks i went
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:29.600]  from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know i could think again i could
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:34.880]  connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years i got my health back
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:38.880]  and i religiously take basically all of your supplements they're they're all absolutely
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:43.360]  amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout it literally like if you want to sleep
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:47.760]  just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:52.480]  we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:57.200]  help into our own hand beautifully said brother i thank you so much for your call at godspeed

[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:35.200]  i got down on my knees
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:44.000]  hey
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:50.640]  we know worldwide is between 11 and 18 percent increase in just general death
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:56.080]  and never even happened during world wars you're killing us we're being depopulated
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:01.760]  look at this story on info wars dot com before i go back to your calls the sport little baby alex
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:08.400]  never knew what heading american tragedy baby boy dies of massive blood plunder hospital
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:15.760]  refused non-vax blood transfusion and the family talks about how they had other family members die
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:25.680]  after taking the shot as well that's the same story over
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:36.320]  and over again and they just follow their orders safe and effective though it's not it's all a lie
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:39.680]  they have steven cobert up there making jokes about it
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:44.480]  but for nando you're saying you had a younger family member
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:49.520]  take it and got sick but luckily got over it hopefully that happened and people a lot of
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:56.640]  folks take ivermectin other things to mitigate it the prions are growing in the body but you
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:02.000]  don't know there's heart damage in young people for years so those that get hit really hard die
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:07.200]  right away but then others are finding massive heart damage which they knew i had dr peter
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:15.040]  mccullough on yesterday in their previous studies of mRNA vaccines for similar viruses to cobert
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:20.960]  that it did cause this in rats so they knew they did it on purpose they're mass murders go ahead
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:28.320]  and tell us what happened to your family member well we don't know the long-term effects of what's
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:33.520]  going on i mean he he plays sports so every single day i don't i think to myself oh my goodness is
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:39.120]  he gonna have a heart attack uh someday and we don't know and of course we do know what it was
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:44.720]  it would have been a chef no excuse for a young person to suffer from stuff like that
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:51.600]  especially perfectly healthy young man sure but you got caught off by the break what happened to
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:56.800]  him when he took the shot okay so basically uh for a couple of days as soon as he got the shot
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:02.000]  according to him he felt like his body was on fire he felt he was getting paralyzed for a couple of
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:10.480]  days uh so fortunately he got over it but they're just hitting us on all all angle no they are and
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:15.520]  so it's his job and your job now to warn everyone you know and never submit to the new four shots
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:20.160]  that are coming and and to support republicans in congress to stop giving the deadly shot to our
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:24.880]  military and then now we've got to have nuremberg trial twos and bring them to justice and that's

[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:37.680]  to say quickly what really grinds my gears is the state of how many congressional people have
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:43.120]  taken the vaccine why don't we know why are they mandating other people and the hypocrisy is up
[01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:49.120]  guess oh i'm glad you raised that it's the same in australia the uk europe here canada the government
[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:54.400]  officials and their employees are exempt oh but the military isn't it doesn't that tell you something
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:52:00.400]  and it turned out japan they have the numbers only nine point seven percent as of a month ago
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:05.680]  of the japanese government took the shot what's that tell you including the health division
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:12.720]  yeah it says everything and again i could it be more about colbert he's doing the
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:18.560]  service to this country in the world and uh finally i just want to say i'm a hebrew and

[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:36.960]  you go ahead josh hey um so i'm a 25 year old small business startup i i do h back i'm near
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:44.080]  scranton pa um one thing i'll mention real quick is i've noticed um google is censoring
[01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:50.240]  positive reviews for my business because i'm very outspoken about my beliefs and i'm definitely
[01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:56.800]  against vaccines uh the poison shots yeah they're not even vaccines as we all know um and you know
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:53:02.720]  all things along those lines i speak truth publicly um i just want to thank you i know you
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:06.720]  don't like being thanked but i want to thank you brother it's not that i appreciate you
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:12.080]  thanking me but we're all fighting for our lives i want to thank you so so yes sir i thank you
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:17.440]  thank me that i mean that's great but i'm going to do a whole show soon on ai because i've talked
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:22.480]  to a bunch of top people and they said the ai is way more advanced for being told the censorship is
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:28.320]  way more advanced than we even know but anyways i'm interrupting you but the point is yes it's ai
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:32.880]  censoring you it's not some google employee because the things you say and do doing that to you
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:38.960]  it's the social credit score through ai is already penalizing people so what i do when i'm driving on
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:44.080]  a road trip through a small town 10 years ago if you just had a business or a gas station or a
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:49.440]  restaurant or a tire or a fireplace it would show every business on the highway and it was a great
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:54.400]  service now if you don't pay google or you're not part of the right group or you don't buy your
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:58.080]  product from the right group you may not know because you're buying your restaurant food from
[01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:02.720]  the right chain you know the right food supplier the right restaurant company that suddenly you're
[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:08.080]  listed but you are because you buy it from the right group and so it's the real discrimination
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:12.560]  well they've got us fighting with each other over black or white or all this stuff they are
[01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:17.760]  literally having ai pick winners and losers including elections right now so you're dead on
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:24.880]  i agree and i was a poll watcher i'm very aware of ai and some other things um underground military
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:31.600]  bases in the area i can't speak too much about that um my i'm just gonna blow through my talking
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:39.040]  points here real quick um i i i hope everyone heals i think the pedophiles and the statinist
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:45.760]  in control i think everyone has a little bit of evil and darkness in them i myself have done
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:51.680]  evil things i've done bad things in my life and i've repented so that's the difference i hope that
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:58.720]  they have a realization and they reconnect with god and i really do hope that even the most evil
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:05.280]  people on this planet find a place where they can heal and repent i know they've gone so far from god
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:12.640]  and so far from what's good but i really do hope that they can reconnect with with what's good and
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:18.080]  i hope that they can heal and and do good for the world i'm not going to count on it i'm not going
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:27.680]  to bet on it um speaking on that i know that your job is to your job is to put out all the news
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:34.880]  your job is to cover all the news good and bad um and i respect that you're fighting a literal war
[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:40.960]  and i'm there with you i'm sharing every day that i can beautiful um one thing that i would
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:47.200]  really love to see is i would really love to see info wars put out positive content showing
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:55.280]  people who are in grassroots communities doing positive things in the local level like local
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:56:02.080]  politicians um really grassroots movements i would love to see you guys i totally agree because the
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:06.720]  enemy suppresses all that and if i had the money for five or six crew members just to do reports
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:11.840]  on that and only focus on the positive i would do it uh you're right we tend to focus on the negative
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:16.240]  too much because we're exposing it so good people are rallying against it but we should show more
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:21.520]  examples of people having success against the evil amazing points thank you so much sir all right
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:29.680]  cody lj justin joe keith will get to all of you but i have the lawyer coming on who i knew filed a
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:34.400]  bunch of suits has had some big success against the bad guys but when he was on like two years ago
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:39.200]  saying and i've got the wuhan whistleblower and he's about to come out and he was the head scientist
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:44.960]  but the name wasn't public i'm like we'll see if this is true he got him to come public a bunch of
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:51.600]  them so my bs meter didn't go off but i'm like wow there's so many you know lawyers that are full
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:58.000]  of hot air out there that i was like you know really watching and i and i've known he's for real
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:03.200]  for over a year and a half but he's just just totally getting on all cylinders and that's
[01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:10.320]  tom renz so he's going to be joining us renz-law.com he was on with harris and smith with the wuhan

[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:29.840]  know listeners you already know all about this but there's a lot of new listeners shooting in the
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:34.480]  don't so if we don't warn people they're gonna keep killing everybody and then they're gonna
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:41.360]  normalize this and come for everybody so we gotta save all the dummies out there okay believe me
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:44.960]  i get mad at the dummies too but if we don't save them we're screwed we'll be right back

[02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:37.920]  real fast i'm working really hard to stop this folks really hard i'm not even doing any defensive
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:43.280]  positions myself i'm just 100 staying at the front of the line because we got a really good
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:49.360]  chance of stopping us getting chills right now people make me so freaking angry we've had so
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:53.920]  much victory against them though and the success we've had i the last caller wanted to hear about
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:58.720]  success when i got loaded phone lines what i'll do is have the guest on if you want to hold i love
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:04.880]  you i'll get you after the guy's gone i'll take some of the next hour but let's just talk about
[02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:10.480]  success and again when i say this the enemy knows all this okay and more because they got a i watching
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:16.800]  it all but i know for a fact we i'm not a great pool player but i've had some games back when i had
[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:22.720]  time to play i got a pool table i play with my wife where i just like hit like almost all the balls
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:28.800]  in the first first round but other times where i'm terrible but you ever like broke the balls and
[02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:37.440]  you like not like four in you used to do this badass break it's just like whoa folks we this
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:46.800]  operation has just grievously hurt the enemy bad i mean they're bleeding out and it's the guest
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:50.880]  it's you it's all of us this whole thing is one operation so when you're calling and thinking me
[02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:57.520]  you're thinking yourself okay i mean we have devastated the enemy and if i tried to go over
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:01.200]  all the things in fact i try to stay focused on the attacks and how to beat the enemy and
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:06.240]  the next information in front of me not what we've done but more and more i sit back because we
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:11.120]  want to sell us for what we've gone through what we paid for this and it's been cheap i mean it's
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:16.720]  been cheap thank god that god put me in this position and and and all the tribulations i've
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:21.040]  gone through only made me stronger to be able to understand what's happening now because if i hadn't
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:24.640]  gone through all this if we hadn't gone through all this we would we know we would even know how
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:29.200]  to deal with the next attack we're getting stronger they're getting weaker that's why they're attacking
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:42.320]  and this broadcast is hands down worldwide the most effective transmission and it affects
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:47.360]  not just this grassroots audience and not just the clips that go out but the intelligentsia
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:52.240]  in the european union resistance in the u.s. government resistance and the intelligence
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:57.280]  agency resistance in the wall street resistance and the academic and ecclesiastical resistance
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:05.520]  in just everywhere and i don't just i mean i get told this by senators house members
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:14.160]  presidents foreign leaders and then they just say listen i want you to know that when we survey
[02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:19.360]  the people waking up at these meetings and events they say who do you think is the most effective
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:26.080]  what woke you up what got us this point they say alex jones and it's not alex jones it's you it's
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:31.520]  this crew members it's the audience it's the guest we have it is us because no matter what
[02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:35.920]  happens to me i don't want if they kill me or something like that in the near future which
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:39.920]  i hope doesn't happen and i'm certainly not suicidal so if i get killed that's but i'm not
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:45.840]  if i get killed i didn't kill myself i'm not naive and we're entering the end game but if they kill
[02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:51.760]  me or set me up or whatever folks don't let that be a defeat just champion the information i've covered
[02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:56.960]  champion the emergency alerts i put out and just let the work i've done which is all god
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:03.280]  for working through me continue on but i know the power of humans i know the power that god's
[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:09.760]  given us i know because i working with other individuals have we have moved mountains together
[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:16.560]  and now we're going into the main assault okay they are attacking us they're admitting their
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:21.280]  pedophiles they're admitting their devil worshipers they are poisoning us they are starting nuclear

[02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:41.600]  the lockdowns the poison shots all of it and i knew early on he was really having a big effect
[02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:46.480]  with his lawsuits but he'd be on air like two years ago saying well i've got the big whistleblower
[02:06:46.480 --> 02:06:52.480]  will release the name soon and they were the high high level inside the the the whole operation and
[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:58.720]  then it comes out it's the vice president of world of eco health alliance and the chief scientist
[02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:04.080]  and now the books out there the truth about wuhan with dr andrew huff both of them were on this morning
[02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:07.680]  harris and smith i didn't have the time to do it but i ended up sitting there in my office for like
[02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:12.320]  40 minutes watching anyone man this is really a good interview really powerful so we're blessed
[02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:16.960]  to have him on with us today i'm letting you come on my show to talk about just because this is
[02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:22.160]  smoking gun stuff okay and the death numbers worldwide by the insurance company smoking gun
[02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:25.680]  and we talked about it a year and a half ago about the insurance numbers but now
[02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:29.680]  it's mainstream news and now there's talk of grand juries and grand juries are being
[02:07:29.680 --> 02:07:33.760]  in panels statewide with the supreme court you know the governor's gonna be successful
[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:39.280]  getting those going show big success praise god thank all those that god worked through
[02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:42.960]  that means people that call people that wrote congress people that supported that means this
[02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:49.120]  audience that means everybody we have really gotten off our flat feet and into a fighting
[02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:54.960]  stance here to not just go quietly into the night and the system is in a chicken with the head cut
[02:07:54.960 --> 02:08:01.360]  off absolute panic mode show attorney tom rinds uh my bs tigger didn't go off thought he was really
[02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:05.840]  credible looked him up saw he was doing great work but i'm like he's got the former chief scientist
[02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:10.800]  and it was true and so many other whistleblowers so it isn't about credit he doesn't come on here
[02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:16.160]  about credit but we need to celebrate the people that have had the courage to take action and and
[02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:20.320]  tell us what was coming next because now he can tell us what's coming next after this and his
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:26.320]  predictions of what the enemy is going to pull uh because we are really winning rins-law.com
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:33.120]  r-e-n-z-law.com god bless you sir for your great work i'm going to try to let you pretty much just
[02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:38.480]  have the floor here and just cover the waterfront but man this is just a crazy time to be alive.
[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:46.800]  boy you got it alex and i gotta tell you uh it's really and i mean this sincerely and i you know
[02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:50.960]  i sat with you in your studio so you've looked me in the eyes so you know when i say this i mean it
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:56.320]  i am truly honored to get that kind of praise from you i mean that you've been fighting this and you
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:09:02.880]  stood through hell that most people wouldn't even think of and it is 100 god it is 100 faith
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:08.240]  we have families we have our future we have our country on the line and we either stand together
[02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:14.560]  and fight for this or we lose everything so we will win this i so as god is my witness i'll stand
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:20.000]  against the gates of hell if i gotta we will win this we've stood pretty damn close to it right now
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:26.480]  already so uh yeah yeah so i wasn't pulling your chain at all when i told you i had some
[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:33.520]  pretty big whistleblowers uh andrew is an amazing guy and not only is he a whistleblower who worked
[02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:40.560]  there but you gotta look at his credibility combat vet masters in security technology uh
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:47.840]  phd in environmental epidemiology worked at sandia national labs had uber top secret clearance
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:55.600]  i mean this guy is rock solid credible and if that's not enough remember when we released
[02:09:55.600 --> 02:10:01.360]  the initial report that included his death his declaration that he gave me under oath under
[02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:09.280]  penalty of perjury when we released that we also included 130 some citations in a separate report
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:15.040]  that didn't cite anything he said and let's remember they came to his house and shot at him i mean
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:22.640]  that's how real this is you have no idea so i actually went it took months before i would i
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:26.480]  you know could really believe some of the stories andrew was telling me i actually
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:31.920]  his house is literally in the middle of nowhere i'm not going to say it to anybody where it is
[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:39.040]  but i'm going to tell you that this guy lives off grid remote uh just it couldn't be more out there
[02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:46.560]  i actually went to his house and spent full full day going around looking at his evidence looking
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:51.280]  at what had happened and personally checking everything out i was gone i had a two-day trip
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:55.680]  to get there well what do you expect he was the vice president the chief scientist they were in
[02:10:55.680 --> 02:11:03.200]  full panic mode he he's blessed even be alive right now oh they're still they're actually in
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:08.640]  bigger panic mode now and you know the thing is is they don't even know like they don't know some
[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:13.120]  of the other whistleblowers i've got i've got whistleblowers that are showing the conspiracy
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:18.880]  in the hospitals to murder patients i've got audio recordings i've got papers i got so much stuff
[02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:23.680]  these guys are this is a warm-up we're just getting started we will have accountability
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:31.920]  i cannot wait to see it happen and i'm going to tell you we've been so careful and so so diligent
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:35.920]  about making sure well you've been led by god because everything you've done has been devastating
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:42.000]  the enemy you definitely have the holy spirit's hand on you well i absolutely will tell you the
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:48.400]  big man has shown me a lot of favor a lot more than i probably deserve uh but you know i try to i try
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:54.560]  to earn it every day never worthy of it but we uh we have huge stuff coming you got to understand
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:59.280]  the thing that really gets them on this and i'm going to tell you i want to stress this the thing
[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:05.120]  that scares them more than anything else that i get the most blowback on okay so get ready for the
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:12.320]  the signal to go down right uh the thing i get the most blowback on is the tie-ins between the
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:19.200]  intelligence community and dod on this seed no one wants the congress to to investigate the dod
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:24.880]  and the intel communities but they are 100 percent involved we've got the receipts and when i say we
[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:29.280]  got the receipts i mean we got the receipts and that's where i was going next they had the neocons
[02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:34.080]  come out today with a report saying the chinese released it i hate the chinese communists they're
[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:39.520]  horrible but we know it wasn't the chai comms so they're so desperate now they're admitting it's
[02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:46.400]  man-made vindicating everything we said but blaming the chinese that's panic mode oh yeah it is
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:50.000]  yeah it is i haven't even seen that report yet i have to take a look i'll show it to you right now
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:56.000]  in a minute keep talking i'll put it on screen please uh so i'll tell you alex uh they're trying
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:01.040]  trying like hell to make sure we don't look at dod and and uh intel community involvement on this
[02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:09.600]  because you know this is just absolutely unquestionable to my mind you know we have we have and just
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:15.280]  put this in common sense term without sharing the evidence that i have let me put this in common
[02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:26.400]  sense terms we have a situation where a us entity sponsored by a government agency who oversees biological
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:34.000]  weapons and weapons development and security issues partnering and giving the technology
[02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:40.640]  to a communist foreign state that's an avowed enemy of the united states to do gain of function
[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:46.640]  research which is the key to bio weapons development in a lab with known ties to the ccp
[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:53.200]  bio weapons program are you going to tell me that we transferred that technology that we funded
[02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:59.280]  those programs and that our dod and intel community didn't know if that's the case we have the least
[02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:03.680]  competent intelligence community on the planet but that's not the case i don't believe that for a
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:08.880]  second plus when you start throwing in the evidence we have that the cia was involved with or had
[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:14.720]  knowledge of or was working with eco health alliance there's no question but you know it's
[02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:20.720]  a tough one and i want to give the republicans an out on this one of the things that i do agree
[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:25.440]  with the republican party on is i absolutely from the bottom of my heart support the heroes
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:31.680]  that are our military so you know we have a lot of the neocons in the republican party
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:35.840]  that just what yes sir no sir whatever the military needs and that's good that they're
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:44.000]  supporting the military but this isn't our soldiers this is being done by the intel community by the
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:48.640]  brass by the people that are sitting their butts in the pentagon not the heroes who are on the
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:54.640]  battlefield this is shady nasty stuff being done by the intelligence community and being
[02:14:54.640 --> 02:14:59.360]  done by the dod and they were involved with the vaccine this is globalist they rolled out the
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:03.600]  vaccine this is globalist control of our military directing and attacking its their own people the
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:10.320]  question is why well you got to look at what's happening and they've told us why and this actually
[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:16.880]  i mean so this is a perfect time for me to share this so i'm doing a bunch of work and i just released
[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:20.720]  some a very short video and i'm going to be releasing a bunch of stuff on twitter related
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:25.200]  to the arizona election steel what's that got to do with this conversation well let me tell you

[02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:51.040]  before the break i'd started talking about the ties i said well what does arizona have to do
[02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:57.200]  with uh covid everything everything so you have the world economic forum you have a bunch of people
[02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:01.840]  and by the way biden's a member yeah all these people you look around the country at the number
[02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:05.360]  of governors and politicians that are part of the world economic forum these guys are all tied

[02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:27.120]  do this we would do that let me explain to you what happens here you launched covid you you inflate
[02:21:27.120 --> 02:21:31.360]  the hell out of the dangers of covid you prevent early treatment so you can drive up to the death
[02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:37.440]  numbers as that's happening you use that fear to steal elections by promoting things like ballot
[02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:41.600]  drops and things where you can harvest ballots right and left and really screw the numbers up
[02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:46.160]  okay and that even goes that goes without even talking about you know whether they were into
[02:21:46.160 --> 02:21:52.160]  the machines and things like that so they're stealing a lot using covid to steal elections
[02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:56.640]  they're also using it to destroy our economy you got a shutdown you destroy small business you
[02:21:56.640 --> 02:22:01.680]  destroy this you destroy that we're getting ready for an economic meltdown right so that's
[02:22:01.680 --> 02:22:06.000]  happening to promote the central bank digital currencies which they want to use to try and
[02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:11.840]  control us even further they we know this because they're telling us this okay so when I say this
[02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:16.560]  you've got to understand some I have always been disciplined about saying I'm speculating
[02:22:16.560 --> 02:22:21.600]  or I have evidence we have them on video saying that this is what they're doing okay this isn't
[02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:28.160]  complicated this is just you've got to dig and listen so covid was at the corner of all this
[02:22:28.160 --> 02:22:33.600]  by the way I'm jumping ahead of myself but when we talk about the next pandemic get ready
[02:22:34.240 --> 02:22:40.720]  we're getting some intel on that now it's not confirmed but what I'm hearing is that it's
[02:22:40.720 --> 02:22:45.280]  going to be time to come out with something going on health wise where we need more lockdowns on a
[02:22:45.280 --> 02:22:50.480]  global scale around the time that the who treaty comes back that's common but in the meantime
[02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:55.200]  I'm one of the things that we've got to do right now is we've got to also look at the
[02:22:55.200 --> 02:23:01.200]  Arizona elections why well if you care about covid and you care about stopping the globalist
[02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:06.080]  there's a lot of things that have to happen and we have to cut them off in more than one direction
[02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:10.880]  now I'm not leaving covid until we've got Anthony Fauci and a whole bunch of other people in jail
[02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:16.880]  but I have to I have to understand what my enemy's doing my enemy's attacking us from a lot of
[02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:24.480]  directions and in Arizona you've got Kerry Lake who has filed to my mind the most credible and
[02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:31.440]  strongest lawsuit that's been filed in the history of law election lawsuits this suit is rock solid
[02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:40.320]  and really what's on trial here is the credibility of the courts okay this case is good the Arizona
[02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:44.960]  law is rock solid and super clear when you interpret law you start with the text of the
[02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:49.840]  legislation and it's very clear that she's got standing she's got allegations of injury she's
[02:23:49.840 --> 02:23:55.360]  got everything she needs to move forward with this challenge so we should if there's any real
[02:23:55.360 --> 02:24:01.200]  justice here have a full access to discovery why does that relate to covid why is that so important
[02:24:01.200 --> 02:24:09.520]  well let me explain to you see if you've got someone like Kerry Lake in there much like Ron
[02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:15.920]  DeSantis she's a disrupting factor in this you only need one instance of truth that people see
[02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:21.680]  before fraud starts falling down everywhere you can only convince people that the sky's red if
[02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:26.320]  everybody says the sky's red if someone says you're an idiot it's blue well that kind of goes
[02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:33.360]  it goes away then because oh yeah I guess you're right okay so this is a really important thing
[02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:39.680]  Kerry Lake's position on this is critical and more just as importantly or more importantly
[02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:44.640]  this case is so strong that I'm going to go on record and say that it's my opinion
[02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:51.680]  that if this case if this challenge doesn't move forward into full investigation I don't as a
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:56.320]  lawyer know that I could file an election case to challenge anything else because I don't think
[02:24:56.320 --> 02:25:01.280]  you could have better evidence and better information so you know to my mind this case
[02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:06.080]  is going to be one of the most determinative cases in terms of election outcomes in American history
[02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:12.160]  it matters because if we can't get good candidates to represent us how do we ensure accountability
[02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:17.680]  on the political side right because my role as an attorney is to facilitate the interpretation of
[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:23.600]  law as it pertains to a specific set of facts in the court okay so I can't go to the court and say
[02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:28.640]  your honor I think this person should go to jail and they say why well because he did something
[02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:33.280]  bad and they say well what's the law there isn't any well I can't do that it doesn't do any good
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:38.640]  right so I've got to have the laws to work with we've got to have the legislation to work with
[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:44.320]  this the other side has spent years decades changing laws in very nuanced ways to make it
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:49.440]  very difficult for a guy like me to go to court and get a win that's why you see so many difficult
[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:54.480]  things on on the election suits which I haven't done a whole lot of election suits I've done work
[02:25:54.480 --> 02:26:00.960]  behind the scenes but uh if you look at the suits that have been filed you know the reason they're
[02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:04.800]  so different there's so much difficulties because all the changes same thing with covid laws that's
[02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:10.160]  why you've got immunity for these these manufacturers or these death jabs and everything else so
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:15.680]  you've got to understand this is the same people and part of the same playbook and just another
[02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:22.400]  tier of the global reset and the global global takeover we the people have got to stand on both
[02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:28.400]  fronts and right now they've got major hearings on Monday Tuesday I believe of next week in Arizona
[02:26:28.400 --> 02:26:32.960]  so we got to make sure that the people of Arizona are hearing this truth and standing because you've
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:39.040]  got katie hobs down there who not only abused her power refusing to recuse herself on an election
[02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:46.160]  she was a part of but she actually went out and asked social media companies to censor her opponent
[02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:54.320]  are you kidding me that is so far beyond illegal men on top of that is if that's not enough I would
[02:26:54.320 --> 02:27:01.680]  think that's more than enough but no no she actually threatened to have county officials arrested
[02:27:01.680 --> 02:27:08.320]  something she doesn't have the authority to do if they didn't fall in line and certify her bogus
[02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:14.160]  election she essentially strong armed or blackmailed these guys and to say and you're going to certify
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:19.840]  me governor you're going to jail are you kidding me there is no greater example of abuse of power
[02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:26.640]  this is insanity we cannot stand aside and allow this and trust me if we do you don't have a whole
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:34.640]  lot of options left in the courts this one's got to go right so this one's critical and it ties back
[02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:43.680]  in because if we can't have real candidates win elections then how do we change this how do we
[02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:50.480]  change this through the system if the courts won't won't ensure that justice is fair and even if
[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:57.920]  the the elections are garbage how do we change this my intent and my purpose is to try and
[02:27:57.920 --> 02:28:02.880]  make sure that we can change this peacefully and through the system and properly that's why this
[02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:08.960]  is so important if our courts dodges if our our politicians dodges if we keep letting this go
[02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:14.640]  how there's no system to fight it through do you think we the people are going to stand for this
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:20.080]  forever no way no way so we've got to do this peacefully but we've got to get out there and do
[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:23.440]  it right well let's try to stay there we'll come back and talk more about this next segment but
[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:29.680]  the woman who is stealing the election runs the election and then she wants censorship
[02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:34.960]  and then the courts don't step in there's just no end they're certifying their ability to steal
[02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:40.640]  elections right now in virginia right now in places like pennsylvania right places like
[02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:46.080]  michigan places like arizona nevada but but but as you said arizona is really the heart
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:50.400]  of where it's all going down this this is a criminal takeover like venezuela a permanent
[02:28:50.400 --> 02:29:00.720]  dictatorship we'll talk about how we stop it straight ahead introducing info wars super

[02:31:08.560 --> 02:31:15.520]  something called vapors they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it
[02:31:15.520 --> 02:31:21.360]  wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a lack
[02:31:21.360 --> 02:31:30.160]  of vitamin d3 you see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin d3 but if you're not
[02:31:30.160 --> 02:31:35.520]  getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin d3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other

[02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:31.360]  because of this man and because of this platform and i would probably not even be half of where i

[02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:32.800]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:37.600]  i'm not gonna tell listeners to shut up in the office today but i'm more excited about it than
[02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:42.720]  when kanye west was here or even donald trump on the show it's good to see old friends
[02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:49.840]  what a crazy time to be alive you know i wish i was wrong about the new world order and all
[02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:54.560]  their evil plans but we've all been completely vindicated and i would actually have rather
[02:33:54.560 --> 02:33:59.040]  been proven wrong but we're not we have the documents we have the proof what a time to be alive
[02:33:59.040 --> 02:34:04.080]  so finishing up with arizona and and the codification around the country of election fraud and getting
[02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:09.200]  back to that you know this whole covered rollout and fouchy having new drills and stuff that kills
[02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:15.280]  kids and just all of it they're definitely reeling now things didn't go the way they wanted them to
[02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:19.760]  but my question is will they double down or how will they regroup attorney tom rance
[02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:26.000]  yes so that's the real question right now alex i mean you know listen we're beating them
[02:34:26.720 --> 02:34:30.640]  hard on covid we're going to beat them on every front because that's what we do
[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:36.560]  and god's got our back but what do you do and so yeah it's an interesting thing because you
[02:34:36.560 --> 02:34:43.360]  know alex when when i came on your show at first and uh you know you talked to me i said i'm a nobody
[02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:48.800]  from ohio and uh we've continued to grow and develop a platform because we do things with
[02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:55.040]  integrity and honesty and we have people now so we have sources we have intel we have all sorts of
[02:34:55.040 --> 02:35:01.360]  information well i want to premise this with this is not something i can prove but this is what i
[02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:09.760]  believe is coming so right now what we're hearing out of dc is there is abject panic the dod crew
[02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:15.040]  does not want any investigation no no the spy agencies want looked at they want nothing to do
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:18.400]  with this they want to figure out who's they're going to hang out to dry and they're going to be
[02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:22.400]  the last people by the way it's not your opinion they're in full panic mode over the fouchy and
[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:27.920]  the criminal investigations that part's not speculation continue no we can see that pretty
[02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:36.080]  clearly um what we're seeing though is kind of this uh this breakdown so fouchy and his crew and
[02:35:36.080 --> 02:35:41.440]  some of the globalists they're hung up on continuing to push death shots and vaccines and other such
[02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:48.960]  things uh because they need it they need this right so the question is when and how do you
[02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:54.640]  roll these things out now they're doing more gain of function more war games and what we've heard
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:36:00.480]  and this is this is what we've heard i can't prove this i don't have papers but we've heard that the
[02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:07.600]  plan is to have something big hit around the time that they get the support necessary to move forward
[02:36:07.600 --> 02:36:12.960]  with the new who treaty they want to get that new who treaty and which is really just a rehash of
[02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:17.680]  the same thing they want the who they have power to take over the world okay so that's a cornerstone
[02:36:17.680 --> 02:36:21.360]  piece of what they're doing and they want to do whatever they got to do to get that in the problem
[02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:27.040]  is is that our fight particularly here in the us has been too powerful guys like macala you know
[02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:32.160]  i've had a little part in it and uh all these different people who are pushing this we've had
[02:36:32.160 --> 02:36:38.160]  a voice we've made a voice thanks to people like you alex who've let us let us talk uh and so
[02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:43.280]  there's a problem you know because it's politically it doesn't look sustainable here in the us
[02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:48.800]  and the other side of this is is that if they lose they know that there's a real likelihood if
[02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:52.320]  people realize how many millions of people these guys have killed that they're going to end up at
[02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:58.000]  the end of a rope you know people aren't going to be okay with that so yeah there's there's this
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:02.640]  kind of breakdown uh you know are we actually going to move forward with another pandemic or are
[02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:08.000]  we just going to say covid's real bad uh you know which yeah i welcome saying that because i'm happy
[02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:12.640]  to point to the fact that it's bad because people keep getting jabbed and that destroys their immune
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:17.360]  system and makes themselves by the way tyrants always go too far in the end of a rope we people
[02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:20.800]  think they're just invincible they're not they always want to kill people they always pull the
[02:37:20.800 --> 02:37:25.360]  same type of crap it's just a high-tech version that they've got to end up at the end of a rope
[02:37:25.360 --> 02:37:30.240]  because that's just through they killed but also what other little little joseph mingle us know
[02:37:30.800 --> 02:37:36.160]  that they're not going to get away with it yeah absolutely i mean they look at they do everything
[02:37:36.160 --> 02:37:40.640]  they can to try and scare us and intimidate us into shutting up that's what january 6 was about
[02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:45.280]  that's what the fbi raids are about that's the bull crap that you were dealing with alex it's all
[02:37:45.280 --> 02:37:52.480]  about trying to intimidate us and shut us up uh but you know at the end of the day uh we're winning
[02:37:53.040 --> 02:37:58.320]  we're winning especially on covid and you know i'm personally branching the fight out i'm going to be
[02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:01.280]  helping on everything because we're going to have to hit them in some of these other angles
[02:38:02.240 --> 02:38:09.360]  but we're winning in a big way and i'll tell you privately when we were doing a strategy
[02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:14.480]  session with my team and my other attorneys that i work with probably last summer i believe is when
[02:38:14.480 --> 02:38:19.120]  i did this i said guys it's time for us to make a change they said what do you mean i said well
[02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:24.640]  we're going to shift our position instead of trying to determine whether we can win this now
[02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:30.560]  we we've won we've already won this and the reason we won it was because guys like you alex
[02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:36.560]  helped us get the truth out and we had created a situation where enough people said no about getting
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:42.240]  this jab that there was a control group so it was a guarantee that the control group was going to
[02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:45.840]  be there and you're going to have what you have now you got a group of people who were part of the
[02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:51.040]  died suddenly crowd and you got another group of people who are healthy as can be not getting covid
[02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:56.320]  not having any issues they're the people who are unjabbed and that's really coming out now so we've
[02:38:56.320 --> 02:39:02.640]  won the question was this how quickly can we win and how many lives can we save and how many do we
[02:39:02.640 --> 02:39:07.760]  have to lose during this fight because you know my goal is always about saving as many lives as
[02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:16.240]  possible so that we shifted that footing and uh it's proving true i mean we are we are absolutely
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:22.320]  seeing this collapse it's going to continue collapsing we will get to accountability and uh
[02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:25.280]  you know that's part of the reason that we're broadening the fight and hitting these guys in
[02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:28.080]  some other areas because i want to get to broadening the fight here but you're absolutely
[02:39:28.080 --> 02:39:34.000]  right i told joe rogan last summer i said this summer the back got broken they didn't know it
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:38.320]  would go this way it blew up in their face they want amnesty now they want to stop talking about
[02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:42.640]  it while they still implement their control but but they're in panic mode i mean but we're not up
[02:39:42.640 --> 02:39:48.080]  here to the horror saying oh we've won the whole war but the enemy is devastated right now so what
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:54.560]  do we do next to press the peaceful attack to bring them to justice yeah so that's it right
[02:39:54.560 --> 02:39:58.480]  and that's part of the reason that we have to broaden this because right now what they're going
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:04.720]  to do in my opinion is the enemy is going down they know that the covid thing is is going down
[02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:10.800]  they know that that truth is coming out and so you've got no loyalty amongst thieves none whatsoever
[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:14.480]  so what they're doing is they're trying to decide who they're going to throw under the bus the problem
[02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:18.320]  is is when you throw a guy like anthony fouchie under the bus anthony fouchie knows where the
[02:40:18.320 --> 02:40:23.200]  bodies are buried so anthony fouchie is going to play hardball if he thinks he's getting thrown
[02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:30.000]  under the bus so they've got this really nasty situation then where what do you do because
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:36.960]  we we don't want to get we don't want to get ours our rear ends in trouble with him uh but
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:42.240]  you know if we don't throw him under the bus uh we lose our credibility so it's a it's one of
[02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:47.840]  those things where they're in a real bad situation and that's why i i mentioned a couple times but
[02:40:47.840 --> 02:40:55.360]  you know broadening the attack because if we can uh dilute their focus if we can effectively hit them
[02:40:55.360 --> 02:41:00.800]  because one thing that i praise god this is 100 percent him you know i just kind of show up every
[02:41:00.800 --> 02:41:07.360]  day but we've been effective in fighting the covid lies we've been very effective if we can
[02:41:07.360 --> 02:41:13.360]  take that same strategy and apply it in these other areas then we can make them have to defend
[02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:17.200]  some of these other areas we gotta have the election so we gotta bring them to justice
[02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:23.040]  what are other areas we've got to dominate in we've got to get this uh the central bank digital
[02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:28.800]  currency is a real threat um i've got a whistleblower and i can't i'm not not ready to say anything
[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:34.400]  more about this but we have some legitimate evidence that the food the tax on the food supplies
[02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:40.160]  were actually organized and they were orchestrated well yeah the u n and they're officially shutting
[02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:43.680]  down the third largest food producer in the world the netherlands they're shutting
[02:41:43.680 --> 02:41:48.160]  food production on everywhere we're officially admitting it yeah well i'm but i'm talking about
[02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:53.680]  the burn no no i understand you've got internal stuff yeah yeah yeah so we've got some interesting
[02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:59.440]  stuff there uh that's an important issue the the energy thing is an important issue um
[02:42:00.400 --> 02:42:05.280]  and uh i would say that those are the main issues you know the we gotta finish covid because these
[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:10.640]  jabs are unbelievable i mean what's happening there that's gotta be stopped and so we're only
[02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:14.720]  we're not done with covid by any means we got a long ways to go just because we're winning
[02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:19.200]  doesn't mean we've won and if we take our foot off the gas we will there is a multi-pronged attack
[02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:25.040]  you gotta attack every every attack they're running yep yep we just gotta find ways and
[02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:29.040]  we gotta ask god to give us more hours in the day so we can fight from more directions because
[02:42:29.040 --> 02:42:34.320]  there's just too many bad guys and uh you know one of the things i've talked about i actually
[02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:38.800]  was at a meeting this weekend and someone was asking me about you know what do we got to do to
[02:42:38.800 --> 02:42:45.040]  win this i said well one of the things you gotta understand i bill for almost none of my time alex

[02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:45.520]  people and god is and evil knows it's gonna lose the question is how bad's it gonna get
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:50.720]  till we turn the tide all right tom rinds attorney getting all these great whistleblowers to go
[02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:55.440]  public devastating the globalist you were getting into i'm just guessing we're gonna cover next
[02:47:55.440 --> 02:48:00.240]  the fact that we all need funding info wars needs funding you need support not just sharing the
[02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:04.880]  articles of videos this is a war we don't have george soros backing us we don't have the new
[02:48:04.880 --> 02:48:10.000]  world order backing us we have the people backing us and the public ever figures out how powerful
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:17.280]  they would be if they actually got more in the arena of support it'd be game over for evil well
[02:48:17.280 --> 02:48:22.000]  that's it right many hands make light work and i'd rather have a million people give me a dollar a
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:27.520]  month than one people give than one person give me five million because uh the one person that
[02:48:27.520 --> 02:48:32.000]  gives you five million will try and control you and undermine you and and get you to do things
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:36.240]  that you don't agree with and i'm not up for sale there is no amount of money i'll i'll work for free
[02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:42.800]  i don't bill for most of my time but here's the thing i don't bill for most of my time but i need
[02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:48.080]  more lawyers and i need to be able to support them so our strategy going forward is not something i
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:54.960]  mind sharing we've got to raise money to support more lawyers right i can't i can't ask them to
[02:48:54.960 --> 02:48:59.920]  work for free they just won't do it more money we got the more lawyers we can get and the better
[02:48:59.920 --> 02:49:05.120]  we can do we got to have the lawyers uh the other thing we got to do is we got to work on
[02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:13.360]  continuing to expand the message so yes donate to info wars uh but also share info wars
[02:49:13.920 --> 02:49:18.320]  and uh while you're at it share the stuff i do um you know i got a rims dash
[02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:22.800]  long mega donation there because you proven you're hitting on all cylinders you got a lot going on
[02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:31.920]  i i yes sir i do an awful lot um and actually next week uh i believe next week the 21st i'm
[02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:37.600]  gonna launch i'm gonna start doing a one hour a day uh talk show on uh america out loud network a
[02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:43.920]  radio show um we're we're because we've got to educate the people we've got to activate the people
[02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:49.680]  see the thing that people don't understand is that if i file a lawsuit but i don't do anything else
[02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:54.320]  we'll get the new zealand effect early on in new zealand there was a young lady who had a massive
[02:49:54.320 --> 02:49:58.960]  win at the supreme court related to this covid corruption the next day they changed the laws
[02:49:58.960 --> 02:50:05.920]  in new zealand so we had to educate the public we had to get people going and engage people being
[02:50:05.920 --> 02:50:12.720]  engaged is the ultimate power the one thing tyrants truly fear you can shoot me you can shoot alex you
[02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:19.680]  can shoot the a couple people but you can never silence all the people they fear we the people
[02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:27.200]  more than anything else and you know the work that i do has been so has been effective praise god
[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:31.600]  but part of the reason it's been effective is because of the public support we've been able
[02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:37.840]  to garner for it that's had a huge impact that's why alex do you know what i did a few weeks ago
[02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:43.520]  you'd have got a i took a page out of your book um so i do the reawakening tour with clay clark
[02:50:43.520 --> 02:50:48.720]  right and they were they were doing they were on the tirade about those evil christian nationalists
[02:50:48.720 --> 02:50:54.080]  right so i stood up on stage and the washington post was there the beast was there there are a
[02:50:54.080 --> 02:51:00.800]  bunch of left-wing papers that were covering this i went up on stage i put on a presentation a slide
[02:51:00.800 --> 02:51:06.080]  show up there i had a big slide up there talking about how proud i am to be a christian nationalist
[02:51:06.080 --> 02:51:11.360]  i am and i am i am proud of it because i believe that jesus teaches me to love everyone treat people
[02:51:11.360 --> 02:51:17.040]  with respect and equality and uh you know love your neighbor and as an american i believe in the
[02:51:17.040 --> 02:51:22.240]  nation that's you know freed slaves and created suffrage and allowed prosperity on a level that
[02:51:22.240 --> 02:51:26.560]  no one's ever seen before and so my question is which part of my christian nationalism do you
[02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:32.800]  have a problem with so i said that on stage and went into the great detail on it you know i couldn't
[02:51:32.800 --> 02:51:38.400]  so much as get a hit piece done on me because the mainstream fears what we do they know they can't
[02:51:38.400 --> 02:51:43.520]  turn it on us we have no shame i don't care what you call me i don't care what they say about me
[02:51:43.520 --> 02:51:49.040]  i got no pride so they're afraid of us so we've got to get the message out farther and since
[02:51:49.040 --> 02:51:54.080]  they're censoring the hell out of me uh praise god for guys like you we got to do well that's the
[02:51:54.080 --> 02:51:58.240]  thing they do they demonize us and they don't understand we're committed to the mission we
[02:51:58.240 --> 02:52:02.400]  know we're right it means nothing in fact it's a good thing when they're attacking because that
[02:52:02.400 --> 02:52:07.440]  means we're over the target and that really freaks them out because as leftists they are so prideful
[02:52:07.440 --> 02:52:11.920]  and so into what the system's saying you don't want the system endorsing you but they're looking
[02:52:11.920 --> 02:52:19.520]  for that there's such losers yeah that's all they care about is approval of others i care zero right
[02:52:19.520 --> 02:52:25.280]  my loyalty is to god my family my country and my friends i don't care one bit yeah someone someone
[02:52:25.280 --> 02:52:30.960]  told me early on so i went through phases as an attorney on this the first phase was the buy off
[02:52:30.960 --> 02:52:34.720]  phase they tried to buy me off to shut me up and they told me oh you could get some appointments
[02:52:35.760 --> 02:52:40.880]  you know you might make a good judge if you would just drop this stuff i said yeah i don't care about
[02:52:40.880 --> 02:52:46.160]  that uh then they then uh that didn't work out and they realized i didn't care about their cocktail
[02:52:46.160 --> 02:52:50.960]  parties which i mean i can't think of a greater wound to inflict on me a cocktail party for me
[02:52:50.960 --> 02:52:57.120]  is a pbr and a campfire uh that's what i like uh then so then they did the death threats you know
[02:52:57.120 --> 02:53:02.400]  i mean you know about those those are ongoing and whatever and uh then they tried to cabin on me and
[02:53:02.400 --> 02:53:06.160]  just smashed me in the press and i didn't care about that either so they went back to censorship
[02:53:06.160 --> 02:53:10.480]  because i don't care about any of it you got to be willing to take some bullets if you're going to
[02:53:10.480 --> 02:53:15.440]  get into this fight and if you're in it for the cause you don't worry about what they say about you
[02:53:15.440 --> 02:53:19.280]  i can only imagine now we're hitting on some of this election stuff what they're going to say
[02:53:19.280 --> 02:53:24.080]  i'm pushing the hashtag by the way hashtag election liars they all want to call us the election
[02:53:24.080 --> 02:53:29.200]  deniers hashtag election liars i want that to trend everywhere i want everybody to be talking
[02:53:29.200 --> 02:53:34.560]  about hashtag election liars because the election liars keep pushing the sheep to call us election
[02:53:34.560 --> 02:53:40.480]  deniers but the only thing we're denying is their lies and it's garbage so you know we're hitting
[02:53:40.480 --> 02:53:46.160]  this on all fronts and uh we gotta we gotta i'm netizia alex we got another top secret project
[02:53:46.160 --> 02:53:52.000]  we're working on uh within a year or so i hope to launch that i think is going to what we're
[02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:55.840]  going to do is we're going to start holding the people uh that are running our country
[02:53:55.840 --> 02:54:01.520]  accountable to the people that are voting for them and uh we got a plan on that so i i intend to bring
[02:54:01.520 --> 02:54:07.520]  political accountability to not a d not an r a freedom thing absolutely beautifully said we
[02:54:07.520 --> 02:54:12.000]  gotta get you back again soon but just back to the coven situation because that's the one
[02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:15.600]  area we can really have a big effect you know they may start to clear war in russia we're trying
[02:54:15.600 --> 02:54:21.120]  to stop that but who knows are they gonna throw fouts here in the bus because he's so insider
[02:54:21.120 --> 02:54:26.640]  they're trying to defend him right now which is only blowing it up bigger so the super secret
[02:54:26.640 --> 02:54:32.960]  stuff happening behind the scenes are this we're trying very hard to ensure that they do throw
[02:54:32.960 --> 02:54:40.400]  him under the bus because i really want to see him in orange um they're trying to save him because
[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:45.440]  he's got a lot of dirt on a lot of people he does know where the bodies are buried so i don't know
[02:54:45.440 --> 02:54:50.240]  my intention is to make sure that before i i'm done with this and before that guy dies he's an
[02:54:50.240 --> 02:54:55.600]  old man he'll probably die before me i'd like him to spend the rest of his days in jail uh
[02:54:55.600 --> 02:55:01.120]  that may sound cruel but you know what he's murdered millions so uh i'd like to see that
[02:55:01.120 --> 02:55:08.880]  guy in jail and we're trying very hard and it's really uh we're we're we're moving over here
[02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:14.480]  they're moving over there and i don't know for sure it's it's a it's a tug of war right now
[02:55:14.480 --> 02:55:19.040]  we're pushing for accountability everywhere they're trying to preserve as much as they're
[02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:26.080]  definitely not arrogant anymore they got fear in their eyes they better they better they're right
[02:55:26.080 --> 02:55:30.480]  to fear because we aren't stopping we got god at our back and like i said we'll stand against the
[02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:36.480]  gates of hell if we gotta well i'm really concerned with bill gates his new bio weapon drill he did
[02:55:36.480 --> 02:55:40.480]  i agree with you i think they're warming that sucker up and i think they're getting ready to release
[02:55:40.480 --> 02:55:46.080]  it uh it's just i wonder how many people that work for the system that know we're telling the truth
[02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:51.360]  still try to heads their bets the only safety is defeating these maniacs you can't just but like
[02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:58.320]  boston university has a super uh cova that kills 80 percent of people and then they just admit that
[02:55:58.320 --> 02:56:02.640]  it's like a threat like we got a weapon that'll kill all of you yeah well you're not gonna get away
[02:56:02.640 --> 02:56:07.040]  with it if you do that i mean they gotta know that that now everything they do it'll just make the
[02:56:07.040 --> 02:56:11.680]  next wave against them bigger so that's kind of the mexican standoff they release the next bio
[02:56:11.680 --> 02:56:15.360]  weapon they have their big distraction but it backfires bigger the next time now that people
[02:56:15.360 --> 02:56:21.360]  know it's them any further assaults by them only make it worse for them i mean that's a pretty simple
[02:56:21.360 --> 02:56:27.520]  equation isn't it oh it is but you know i mean the boston university is just one of many i mean
[02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:34.160]  we've got co listen bouchie actually dug up some people up in the arctic uh that died way back from
[02:56:34.160 --> 02:56:40.320]  the spanish flu and reconstituted the spanish flu he's also he's working down you know i've
[02:56:40.320 --> 02:56:47.440]  done in texas texas of all places in galveston they're working on uh gain a function on uh ebola
[02:56:47.440 --> 02:56:52.560]  that's right they're gonna die from complete maniacs illegal stuff going on in galveston
[02:56:53.360 --> 02:56:57.440]  they're just mad scientists people say why are they doing it why jeffrey dommer do it

[03:01:42.640 --> 03:01:48.480]  and when i heard in no offense to senator paul but when i when i heard him you know talking
[03:01:48.480 --> 03:01:58.800]  about hey we're we we're not going to pass the um the and uh nda um until we wipe out you know get
[03:01:58.800 --> 03:02:05.520]  rid of this mandate problem is is that how many people that are currently in are are backs i can
[03:02:05.520 --> 03:02:11.440]  i can give you numbers at least with regards to my service um well i can give you approximate
[03:02:11.440 --> 03:02:18.720]  numbers um and how many people in the in the population you know it so it really is saying
[03:02:18.720 --> 03:02:25.040]  it's a day late and a dollar short yeah in all honesty it was um it was kind of a fluff piece
[03:02:25.040 --> 03:02:28.720]  you know it was it was it was kind of like a feel good if you will like hey we're doing
[03:02:28.720 --> 03:02:36.080]  something for you um but really you know yeah exactly a day late dollar short so um i understand
[03:02:36.080 --> 03:02:41.520]  that and they bowed during the main hike we didn't but believe me the globalists are pissed they want

[03:03:00.640 --> 03:03:06.640]  everybody i ran into that got it before it was mandated the one and only reason that i ever heard
[03:03:06.640 --> 03:03:11.680]  anybody say they got it was because they wanted some of the stuff that they were being restricted
[03:03:11.680 --> 03:03:17.360]  from back meaning they didn't want to wear a mask they they wanted to go on leave they wanted uh

[03:05:03.840 --> 03:05:09.440]  victories tonight possible the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible
[03:05:09.440 --> 03:05:14.800]  the only thing that made any uh opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school
[03:05:14.800 --> 03:05:20.800]  shutdowns and and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible that made any resistance
[03:05:20.800 --> 03:05:27.120]  to it possible was people continuing to support info wars despite the massive lawfare being waged
[03:05:27.120 --> 03:05:33.600]  against info wars despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against info wars the ordinary
[03:05:33.600 --> 03:05:39.360]  people the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier wealthier and wiser
[03:05:39.360 --> 03:05:45.680]  is what keeps info wars on the air and what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era
[03:05:45.680 --> 03:05:51.600]  in an age of totalitarian oppression so continue to do it go to places like info war store dot com
[03:05:51.600 --> 03:05:56.880]  go to the places like save info wars continue to keep info wars alive because in the process

[03:06:16.560 --> 03:06:24.160]  transmuting world wide from the summit dot news studios in united kingdom you are listening
[03:06:24.160 --> 03:06:36.640]  to her joseph watson
[03:06:36.640 --> 03:06:43.440]  by once again gonna cover a raft of news on the show today including absolute bedlam
[03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:50.640]  in france in brussels belgium following morocco's exit from the world cut last night at the hands
[03:06:50.640 --> 03:06:57.360]  of france suffice to say the celebrations in terms of the morocco's turned a little bit sour
[03:06:58.080 --> 03:07:02.720]  first though i want to talk about this because last time i was hosting the show i talked about it
[03:07:02.720 --> 03:07:08.960]  it was one of the biggest stories in the united kingdom still is in my view and it's about climate
[03:07:08.960 --> 03:07:14.640]  lockdowns now of course we know back during the covid lockdowns which are now proven to have been
[03:07:14.640 --> 03:07:20.960]  a complete outrage based on phony science totalitarian mind control and over theamongering
[03:07:22.160 --> 03:07:28.160]  it was celebrated how quiet how peaceful it was and global warming climate change activists said
[03:07:28.160 --> 03:07:36.240]  why can't we do this again for the planet to save mother earth then of course india actually went
[03:07:36.240 --> 03:07:41.920]  ahead and did and did it in some of their major cities they said you can't drive into the city on
[03:07:41.920 --> 03:07:47.280]  this day because we have bad pollution on this day on the very same day they announced that
[03:07:47.920 --> 03:07:51.600]  sky news and all these other legacy media outlets came out and said
[03:07:51.600 --> 03:07:55.920]  climate lockdowns are a dangerous conspiracy theory anyone talking about it is insane and
[03:07:55.920 --> 03:08:02.080]  we're going to ban and censor anyone who does and of course that is the purpose of the fact
[03:08:02.080 --> 03:08:09.120]  checker industrial complex it's not a separate organization movement from legacy media it's
[03:08:09.120 --> 03:08:16.560]  all part of the same borg now i talked about the traffic plan as they're calling it in oxfordshire
[03:08:16.560 --> 03:08:23.760]  last week this is a de facto climate lockdown basically what they're saying is you're going to
[03:08:23.760 --> 03:08:30.800]  get government permits 100 times a year for 100 trips a year which by the way is only two a week
[03:08:31.360 --> 03:08:37.440]  where you're only allowed to drive out of your allotted region within oxford by the way oxford's
[03:08:37.440 --> 03:08:44.080]  not even a big town in comparison to some of the other big cities in the united kingdom the government
[03:08:44.080 --> 03:08:50.240]  will give you permission via a network of automatic license plate scanning surveillance cameras where
[03:08:50.240 --> 03:08:57.440]  you're only allowed to leave your climate region within oxford 100 times a year or twice a week
[03:08:57.440 --> 03:09:03.520]  obviously they're going to have exemptions for NHS health workers delivery men people like that but
[03:09:03.520 --> 03:09:09.520]  for the majority of people indeed the vast majority of people in oxford say you work on the other side
[03:09:09.520 --> 03:09:16.240]  of the city you're only allowed to travel outside of your little region twice a week so if you're
[03:09:16.240 --> 03:09:20.880]  going to work on the other side of the city five times a week you're screwed because the government
[03:09:20.880 --> 03:09:28.560]  will only give you 100 permits per year the rest of the time every single time you violate that
[03:09:28.560 --> 03:09:36.160]  climate region lockdown you're going to get fine 70 pounds the equivalent of 100 dollars a pop every
[03:09:36.160 --> 03:09:41.440]  time now we're living through a cost of living crisis here in the united kingdom as many are
[03:09:41.440 --> 03:09:47.040]  across the west where people having to choose between eating and heating this winter they're
[03:09:47.040 --> 03:09:53.040]  having to refire old coal plants because renewable energy is completely useless and unable to meet
[03:09:53.040 --> 03:09:59.200]  demand as we said all along it's about reducing people's living standards getting them under the
[03:09:59.200 --> 03:10:05.520]  thumb of this climate control agenda and so they're not going to be able to afford the 100
[03:10:05.520 --> 03:10:13.360]  dollar fines multiple times weekly so is it a climate lockdown this is the big argument now
[03:10:13.360 --> 03:10:19.360]  with the fact checkers claiming that they've debunked this because the council who are enforcing
[03:10:19.360 --> 03:10:26.080]  this scheme first with a trial and then later across the entire city well they don't call it
[03:10:26.080 --> 03:10:34.400]  a climate lockdown so then it's not a climate lockdown okay how was the covid lockdown enforced
[03:10:34.400 --> 03:10:42.960]  in the united kingdom back in march april may 2020 did they snatch people off the streets who
[03:10:42.960 --> 03:10:50.480]  violated covid lockdowns and put them in prison no so how did they enforce covid lockdowns anyone
[03:10:50.480 --> 03:10:56.880]  caught violating a covid lockdown and in some cases it was literally people sitting on a park
[03:10:56.880 --> 03:11:03.440]  bench eating their lunch they literally taped off park benches so you can sit on them they taped off
[03:11:03.440 --> 03:11:10.080]  children's play areas anyone caught outside without a justifiable reason going to buy food going to
[03:11:10.080 --> 03:11:17.920]  the doctors out on their hourly allotted government exercise run how was the lockdown enforced it was
[03:11:17.920 --> 03:11:25.200]  enforced by fines so if the covid lockdown was enforced by fines was that a lockdown or not
[03:11:25.200 --> 03:11:34.080]  yes it was this climate lockdown is going to be enforced by onerous fines so yes it's a climate
[03:11:34.080 --> 03:11:39.440]  lockdown there are ways around it but you've got to pay through the nose there aren't going to be
[03:11:39.440 --> 03:11:44.960]  physical barriers up stopping you from going from one area of the city to another but there'll be
[03:11:44.960 --> 03:11:51.600]  automatic license plate scanning cameras which will automatically deduct the money from your bank
[03:11:51.600 --> 03:11:58.240]  account because you have to register your car with the local authorities so for them to come out the
[03:11:58.240 --> 03:12:03.600]  fact checker industrial complex as they have over the past week and claim this is all conspiracy
[03:12:03.600 --> 03:12:10.480]  theory there is no climate lockdown is absolute bunk if you're enforcing it the same way you
[03:12:10.480 --> 03:12:18.480]  enforce the covid lockdown what else could it be but a lockdown ap headline traffic plan in
[03:12:18.480 --> 03:12:24.720]  oxfordshire they called it a traffic plan so it's just a traffic plan traffic plan in oxfordshire
[03:12:24.720 --> 03:12:31.200]  england isn't a climate lockdown despite being exactly the same as the covid lockdown and again
[03:12:31.200 --> 03:12:39.120]  bear in mind they run these fact checks so they can then relegate the story the outrage the real
[03:12:39.120 --> 03:12:44.640]  scandal in social media algorithms some of that's getting better with twitter now obviously
[03:12:44.640 --> 03:12:50.960]  but this is what they did for the lab leak theory this is what they did when top doctors came out
[03:12:50.960 --> 03:12:57.040]  and challenged the safety of the vaccine this is what they did when top scientists and sociologists
[03:12:57.040 --> 03:13:02.560]  came out and said lockdowns are going to kill more people than the virus they called it all a
[03:13:02.560 --> 03:13:08.240]  conspiracy theory falsely working with the authorities working with some of the same people
[03:13:09.200 --> 03:13:16.160]  Fauci and his crew who worked with the lab in wuhan to bury that information under the guides
[03:13:16.160 --> 03:13:22.000]  of a fact check this is how they bury legitimate information this is how they censor legitimate
[03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:29.760]  scandals via the fact checker industrial complex says claim the county of oxfordshire england
[03:13:29.760 --> 03:13:34.000]  which includes the city of oxford is imposing a climate lockdown which will confine residents to
[03:13:34.000 --> 03:13:40.160]  their neighborhoods well again will you confine to your neighborhood during covid if you went to
[03:13:40.160 --> 03:13:45.520]  a different part of the city in london for example no they didn't snatch you off the street they didn't
[03:13:45.520 --> 03:13:52.000]  bundle you in the back of a police fan and take you home they find you and it was still a lockdown
[03:13:52.000 --> 03:13:58.480]  says ap's assessment false oxfordshire has approved a plan to put traffic filters on some main roads
[03:13:58.480 --> 03:14:03.840]  restricting dark drivers access during daytime hours and freeing up space for buses cyclists
[03:14:03.840 --> 03:14:09.840]  and pedestrians oh that's the other thing they say this won't apply between 7 p.m and 7 a.m
[03:14:09.840 --> 03:14:15.600]  therefore it's not a lockdown even though the vast majority of traffic is going through these areas
[03:14:15.600 --> 03:14:22.960]  outside of those time zones this book car owners can apply for day-long permits to bypass the new
[03:14:22.960 --> 03:14:28.720]  rules and many of the vehicles are exempt yeah they only get given a hundred passes per year
[03:14:28.720 --> 03:14:33.760]  two times a week they want to go outside their little climate zone more than twice a week they
[03:14:33.760 --> 03:14:40.400]  get hit with a hundred dollar fine so no you can't just apply for a permit and avoid it
[03:14:40.400 --> 03:14:48.160]  you'll be fined once you exceed that rationing permit limit goes on to say local leaders in
[03:14:48.160 --> 03:14:53.040]  oxfordshire voted to try new traffic reduction system in order to reduce congestion so then
[03:14:53.040 --> 03:14:59.200]  they hide it behind oh it's just a traffic filter scheme and then they talk about how people drew
[03:14:59.200 --> 03:15:05.120]  attention to this climate lockdown trials wrote one twitter user but it says oxford's traffic
[03:15:05.120 --> 03:15:10.560]  filters will not block access to any part of the city of oxford or the rest of the county let alone
[03:15:10.560 --> 03:15:15.600]  lock people in their neighborhoods no no one ever said they would physically put up barriers to
[03:15:15.600 --> 03:15:22.000]  prevent people getting to a different part of the city it's enforced by fines there weren't
[03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:27.680]  physical barriers to stop people walking around during covid lockdowns were there it was enforced
[03:15:27.680 --> 03:15:34.240]  by fines it was still a lockdown everywhere in the city will still be accessible by car so
[03:15:34.240 --> 03:15:39.680]  Paul Smith spokesperson for the oxfordshire county council yes but if you violate the rules
[03:15:39.680 --> 03:15:44.480]  you will get fined nobody will need permission from the county council to drive or leave their
[03:15:44.480 --> 03:15:49.440]  home you won't need permission they'll just fine you every day when you violate the rules
[03:15:49.440 --> 03:16:02.240]  summit dot news talk about this more we'll be back
[03:16:19.440 --> 03:16:29.040]  we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever had
[03:16:29.040 --> 03:16:36.000]  we are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important than
[03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:40.480]  ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been
[03:16:40.480 --> 03:16:47.280]  tearing out and to intensify that i bless you all i salute you i thank you and i beg you to

[03:16:52.720 --> 03:16:59.680]  is my fight it's your fight it's our fight god bless you all until about 150 years ago cultures
[03:16:59.680 --> 03:17:06.480]  all over the world believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of
[03:17:06.480 --> 03:17:13.440]  something called vapors they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it
[03:17:13.440 --> 03:17:19.280]  wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a lack
[03:17:19.280 --> 03:17:28.080]  of vitamin d3 you see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin d3 but if you're not
[03:17:28.080 --> 03:17:33.360]  getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin d3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other
[03:17:33.360 --> 03:17:38.720]  things you start replicating and taking your body over so now it's more important than ever because

[03:20:00.000 --> 03:20:19.280]  the lies of the new world order it's alex jones live from the summit dot news headquarters
[03:20:19.280 --> 03:20:28.800]  it's paul joseph watson so this ap fact check again tries to deny tries to debunk the fact that it
[03:20:28.800 --> 03:20:34.000]  is a climate lockdown it's a lockdown enforced by a system of fines the same way that the covid
[03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:41.600]  lockdown was enforced back in 2020 the article goes on to say the traffic filters are licensed plate
[03:20:41.600 --> 03:20:47.680]  recognition cameras not physical barriers oh that's okay then just because there weren't you know
[03:20:47.680 --> 03:20:52.640]  police physically stopping you from going outside did that mean the lockdown was okay no it was
[03:20:52.640 --> 03:20:59.520]  outrage from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. drives in private cars will be automatically fined they admit it
[03:20:59.520 --> 03:21:06.480]  there in the article will be automatically fined if they cross through the filters without a permit
[03:21:07.360 --> 03:21:15.200]  so it's not as if you agree to pay a certain charge like on a toll bridge or something like
[03:21:15.200 --> 03:21:22.080]  that no automatically fined and that brings a at least a civil criminal type of application doesn't
[03:21:22.080 --> 03:21:27.520]  it you're not agreeing to something when you've been automatically fined if they cross through
[03:21:27.520 --> 03:21:32.720]  the filters without a permit motorists who live in oxford will be able to apply for 100 day long
[03:21:32.720 --> 03:21:37.440]  permits to drive through the filters per year again that's only two a week if you work in a
[03:21:37.440 --> 03:21:44.000]  different area and you have to drive there five times a week you'll find three times a week absolutely
[03:21:44.000 --> 03:21:49.200]  incredible and by the way there was big uproar all the council meetings when they were not discussing
[03:21:49.200 --> 03:21:54.720]  this but imposing it one of the local officials basically came out and said we know people don't
[03:21:54.720 --> 03:21:59.280]  like it but we're just going to go ahead and do it anyway because they need to milk the public for
[03:21:59.280 --> 03:22:04.080]  more revenue generation despite the fact that everyone's going broke because they can't even
[03:22:04.080 --> 03:22:10.400]  afford to pay their own heating bills because of the current thing goes on to say the 15 minute
[03:22:10.400 --> 03:22:16.160]  city club that's what it was referred to by some people on twitter and because the 15 minute city
[03:22:16.160 --> 03:22:22.000]  club is a different scheme then this whole climate lockdown thing is a conspiracy theory doesn't exist
[03:22:22.000 --> 03:22:28.480]  just because some people on twitter called it the wrong thing absolutely incredible
[03:22:29.680 --> 03:22:35.920]  meanwhile telegraph reports police called in over abusive reaction to council's climate
[03:22:35.920 --> 03:22:41.360]  lockdown traffic scheme and this is what they do every single time whenever there's legitimate
[03:22:41.360 --> 03:22:48.560]  outrage about something being imposed on people they select the few threatening abusive messages
[03:22:48.560 --> 03:22:55.600]  that were sent to council members and then that becomes the story draconian plans to divide oxford
[03:22:55.600 --> 03:23:01.280]  into residents into six climate zones have led to council chiefs calling in the police over extreme
[03:23:01.280 --> 03:23:08.160]  abuse so yeah the solution to this is not to abuse the council members it's to protest against it
[03:23:08.160 --> 03:23:13.600]  and it's to not comply with it when they try and put it in just as people didn't comply with the
[03:23:13.600 --> 03:23:20.560]  covid fines and basically all of them got kicked out of court because there was mass non-compliance
[03:23:21.920 --> 03:23:28.480]  there's also a lot of non-compliance with the climate change agenda global poll finds four
[03:23:28.480 --> 03:23:34.400]  in ten people believe climate change is natural this was commissioned by electricity company
[03:23:34.400 --> 03:23:40.880]  edf via ipsos they asked people in 30 countries across five continents to give their views on
[03:23:40.880 --> 03:23:46.720]  what they thought was causing climate change 37 percent of respondents said they believed it was
[03:23:46.720 --> 03:23:51.760]  quote mainly due to the kinds of natural phenomena that the earth has experienced throughout its
[03:23:51.760 --> 03:23:58.880]  history so again despite all the brainwashing all the social engineering for a period of decades now
[03:24:00.080 --> 03:24:05.760]  people aren't buying it and in fact those numbers have increased by six points over the
[03:24:05.760 --> 03:24:11.360]  last three years so climate change skepticism despite the intense wave of propaganda and
[03:24:11.360 --> 03:24:16.000]  social engineering to the point where it's now in you know scripts for sole pop as it's in the
[03:24:16.000 --> 03:24:24.560]  adverts it's everywhere the message fewer people believe in it their propaganda is failing meanwhile
[03:24:24.560 --> 03:24:31.520]  in the uk and this brings us to our next video back in august we had so-called record high
[03:24:31.520 --> 03:24:37.040]  temperatures measured on the tarmac at airports with jets running around and that was supposedly
[03:24:37.040 --> 03:24:42.560]  proof of global warming well is this current cold snap where snow is still on the ground and has
[03:24:42.560 --> 03:24:48.720]  been for a week sub zero temperatures is that proof of global cooling let's ask the question in
[03:24:48.720 --> 03:24:54.880]  this video they don't count here it is remember back in summer when they said the uk recorded
[03:24:54.880 --> 03:24:59.840]  its hottest temperature ever let's just brush aside for the moment the fact that the measurements
[03:24:59.840 --> 03:25:05.520]  for the hottest day ever were taken on the tarmac at Heathrow airport we were browbeaten for weeks
[03:25:05.520 --> 03:25:10.640]  about how high temperatures were an ominous harbinger of out of control global warming by the very
[03:25:10.640 --> 03:25:16.000]  same people who tell you weather is an indicative of long-term climate trends apart from in the
[03:25:16.000 --> 03:25:21.760]  summer when it bolsters their narrative then it is apparently while people across the uk enjoyed
[03:25:21.760 --> 03:25:26.960]  the hot weather because boy is that a rarity here the Met Office was running around in a blind panic
[03:25:26.960 --> 03:25:32.480]  declaring a national emergency so if high temperatures in the summer are a sure sign of global warming
[03:25:32.480 --> 03:25:37.920]  what about low temperatures in winter no they don't count the uk just recorded its coldest day in
[03:25:37.920 --> 03:25:43.520]  12 years almost the entire country has been blanketed with snow causing absolute mayhem it's
[03:25:43.520 --> 03:25:49.360]  colder than a polar bear's toenails around here global cooling no that's just the weather but wait
[03:25:49.360 --> 03:25:53.680]  you said in summer the weather that we had was proof of global warming yeah but that's different
[03:25:53.680 --> 03:26:00.800]  because because uh funny isn't it how the just stop oil climate change activists who've been
[03:26:00.800 --> 03:26:06.080]  causing chaos in london for months blocking roads and gluing themselves to things suddenly
[03:26:06.080 --> 03:26:11.120]  disappeared when it started snowing a bit in london where've they all gone maybe someone should
[03:26:11.120 --> 03:26:15.200]  check on him or maybe it's not good for optics when you're whining about global warming in the
[03:26:15.200 --> 03:26:20.560]  middle of a bone shivering cold snap meanwhile a new global ipsos pole finds that nearly four
[03:26:20.560 --> 03:26:26.000]  in ten people believe climate change is natural across 30 different countries on five different
[03:26:26.000 --> 03:26:32.000]  continents 37 percent of respondents said climate change was quote mainly due to the kinds of natural
[03:26:32.000 --> 03:26:36.480]  phenomena that the earth has experienced throughout its history and that climate skepticism has grown
[03:26:36.480 --> 03:26:41.840]  by plus six points in the last three years the poll was commissioned by energy company and net
[03:26:41.840 --> 03:26:48.160]  zero advocate edf they said the results were quote unexpected how can they not believe us we control
[03:26:48.160 --> 03:26:52.320]  all the institutions all the transnational corporations all the banks the media the entertainment
[03:26:52.320 --> 03:26:56.800]  industry the law all of which have relentlessly pushed the message about climate change and
[03:26:56.800 --> 03:27:01.440]  they still don't believe us just think about that for a second after all the social engineering
[03:27:01.440 --> 03:27:07.520]  all the constant bombardment of the message there's still a huge chunk of the population who simply
[03:27:07.520 --> 03:27:12.160]  don't buy it i mean one wonders why they're so surprised people across the west are being forced
[03:27:12.160 --> 03:27:16.800]  to choose between heating and eating this winter they're suffering through a chronic cost of living
[03:27:16.800 --> 03:27:22.080]  crisis which is being exacerbated by higher and higher energy bills which in turn are exacerbated
[03:27:22.080 --> 03:27:28.240]  by the mad march towards net zero now they expect us to start paying climate reparations to third
[03:27:28.240 --> 03:27:33.200]  world countries too no sorry we're not doing that can't afford it so yeah don't be too shocked when
[03:27:33.200 --> 03:27:39.680]  people value being able to stay warm and feed themselves over some utopian feudalist agenda
[03:27:39.680 --> 03:27:46.960]  to empty our bank accounts and permanently reduce our standard of living now again going back to
[03:27:46.960 --> 03:27:52.800]  that poll it really is incredible that climate change skepticism is growing when you have social
[03:27:52.800 --> 03:27:59.520]  engineering to the degree where here in the uk basically every television program or online
[03:27:59.520 --> 03:28:07.040]  broadcast that goes out has to be approved by this weird shadowy environmental group called
[03:28:07.040 --> 03:28:12.880]  albert and you'll notice their influence because the albert footprint carbon footprint symbol
[03:28:12.880 --> 03:28:18.240]  flashes up on screen in all these programs and it basically means that those broadcasters that
[03:28:18.240 --> 03:28:24.400]  program has signed on to the message that it's a sustainable production and that it's going along
[03:28:24.400 --> 03:28:29.920]  with the narrative so they're literally putting television programs through purity filters to
[03:28:29.920 --> 03:28:35.040]  ensure that they've signed on to the climate change message that they will be used as an orifice to
[03:28:35.040 --> 03:28:42.000]  push the same propaganda and it's still not working huge numbers of people remain skeptical
[03:28:42.000 --> 03:28:49.600]  arctic summit sea ice has now stopped declining that's just come out today the house of cards really
[03:28:49.600 --> 03:28:54.160]  is beginning to tumble down we'll be back summit dot news don't go away

[03:33:36.640 --> 03:33:43.280]  is finally coming to an end on sunday with argentina and france competing in the final
[03:33:43.280 --> 03:33:50.560]  which of course meant the exit of morocco last night in the semifinal with france and once again
[03:33:50.560 --> 03:33:56.240]  after every single win that they've had moroccan fans have rioted across european cities you'd think
[03:33:56.240 --> 03:34:01.840]  that maybe in defeat they'd be a bit more humble and that they wouldn't cause absolute bedlam once
[03:34:01.840 --> 03:34:09.200]  again well guess what they caused absolute bedlam once again telegraph reports boy 14 run over and
[03:34:09.200 --> 03:34:16.000]  killed as france celebrates world cup victory over morocco yes there was an actual fatality
[03:34:16.880 --> 03:34:22.000]  the celebrations in france after its world cup victory over morocco were marred by tragedy on
[03:34:22.000 --> 03:34:27.520]  wednesday night after a 14 year old boy was run over and killed in montpellier let's go to this video
[03:34:27.520 --> 03:34:32.160]  now to set the scene for all this we're going to play this up until the three minute 14 mark and
[03:34:32.160 --> 03:34:39.920]  then i'll come back and talk about what france is experiencing in terms of this moroccan migrant
[03:34:39.920 --> 03:34:46.960]  occupation basically now of some major french cities and what that says about multiculturalism
[03:34:46.960 --> 03:34:55.680]  and diversity being a strength this video is called chaos let's roll it
[03:34:56.400 --> 03:35:02.800]  every time morocco won in the world cup their fans staged violent riots in major cities across europe
[03:35:10.400 --> 03:35:14.080]  so given they were beaten by france last night and knocked out of the tournament
[03:35:14.080 --> 03:35:19.760]  and how do you think they reacted maybe they'd stay home this time nice cup of tea early to bed
[03:35:19.760 --> 03:35:28.720]  no they staged violent riots in major cities across the uro and this time it ended in tragedy
[03:35:28.720 --> 03:35:34.000]  a 14 year old boy was killed after being hit by a car in montpellier as a wave of unrest once again
[03:35:34.000 --> 03:35:39.520]  swept across france shocking footage circulating on social media shows moroccan fans attempting
[03:35:39.520 --> 03:35:44.960]  to steal a french flag from a car the driver then panics and runs over multiple people including
[03:35:44.960 --> 03:35:49.840]  the boy who later died in hospital the incident was one of multiple violent clashes between
[03:35:49.840 --> 03:35:55.280]  moroccan and french fans the bedlam unfolded in several different ethnically diverse cities
[03:35:55.280 --> 03:36:15.120]  including avignon paris renewable and leal where rioters set fires in the street
[03:36:15.120 --> 03:36:24.000]  and gangs of youths attacked police
[03:36:26.640 --> 03:36:32.640]  conservative politician eric seaott said his city of niece had been plunged into urban guerrilla
[03:36:32.640 --> 03:36:46.320]  warfare as morocans fought running battles with riot cops
[03:36:50.320 --> 03:36:56.960]  hooded men shouting quote arabs out and quote we are home also confronted moroccan fans in
[03:36:56.960 --> 03:37:01.600]  niece there are multiple videos which i can't even show of people carrying french flags being
[03:37:01.600 --> 03:37:06.480]  brutally beaten by moroccan fans in the streets around a hundred and fifteen arrests were made
[03:37:06.480 --> 03:37:12.160]  in the greater paris area and all this happened despite france deploying 10 000 police officers
[03:37:12.160 --> 03:37:17.600]  and john darms in anticipation of the unrest france's minister of the interior gerald darman in
[03:37:17.600 --> 03:37:23.040]  reacted somewhat bizarrely by tweeting his gratitude to authorities who quote allowed
[03:37:23.040 --> 03:37:28.400]  those who wanted to celebrate the victory of france and the beautiful course of morocco to do so
[03:37:28.400 --> 03:37:43.360]  yes strange form of celebration isn't it but the chaos wasn't just limited to france in brosles
[03:37:43.360 --> 03:37:48.960]  belgium where earlier this year leftist leader conor rousseau admitted that multiculturalism
[03:37:48.960 --> 03:38:06.320]  had failed similar scenes of pandemonium unfolded but remember people diversity is our greatest
[03:38:06.320 --> 03:38:14.400]  strength but they have it again the non natives are restless of course france has had multicultural
[03:38:14.400 --> 03:38:20.160]  migrant riots for decades now some of the bigger ones occurred in the early 2000s and we see them
[03:38:20.160 --> 03:38:26.480]  more and more often before the champions league final in paris back in may of this year we saw
[03:38:26.480 --> 03:38:32.480]  many of the same types of crowds migrant youth mobs robbing and violently attacking liverpool
[03:38:32.480 --> 03:38:38.480]  and rail madrid supporters and france itself has a lot of problems with this migrant population
[03:38:38.480 --> 03:38:47.360]  in particular where there are 700 000 moroccan's now moroccan migrants dual nationality in france
[03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:52.560]  and it leads to incidents like this this happened on monday just a few days before
[03:38:52.560 --> 03:38:57.280]  that bedlam in france and bearing in mind as i said at the start of that video after every
[03:38:57.280 --> 03:39:04.560]  single game morocco play they riot not just in france but in belgium and in the netherlands
[03:39:04.560 --> 03:39:11.680]  on monday in france this is a headline a remix news five injured in little supermarket stabbing
[03:39:11.680 --> 03:39:17.520]  spree by moroccan national armed with knives and an axe he basically just started randomly
[03:39:17.520 --> 03:39:23.440]  attacking shoppers trying to slash them trying to chop them down as they fled one man lost his
[03:39:23.440 --> 03:39:29.600]  finger a couple of people were seriously injured others with minor injuries again just a few days
[03:39:29.600 --> 03:39:35.760]  before this bedlam 88 year old french man dies after brutal beating from brothers mohammed
[03:39:35.760 --> 03:39:41.600]  and hitchham good old french names an 88 year old man was brutally attacked by brothers mohammed k
[03:39:41.600 --> 03:39:46.560]  and hitchham k in the cellar of his apartment building in france he died of his injuries
[03:39:47.360 --> 03:39:53.680]  another story out today from remix news moroccan migrant jailed for raping 59 year old victim at
[03:39:53.680 --> 03:40:02.320]  knife point i'd kind of see a pattern here we of course had lola the uh 12 year old girl who was
[03:40:02.320 --> 03:40:09.840]  abducted tortured raped murdered stuffed in a suitcase by an algerian migrant who was in the
[03:40:09.840 --> 03:40:15.760]  country illegally the border force apprehended the individual should have deported them but didn't
[03:40:17.200 --> 03:40:23.360]  but according to president macron mass migration is part of france's dna yes he actually said that
[03:40:23.360 --> 03:40:31.360]  again this idea that it's always been completely normal to have this scale this accelerated rapid
[03:40:31.360 --> 03:40:38.960]  influx of migrants in a european city when it's never been normal of course macron made those
[03:40:38.960 --> 03:40:44.000]  comments after he acknowledged that half of crimes in paris were committed by foreigners by the
[03:40:44.000 --> 03:40:50.400]  government's own numbers and that they also account for 70 percent of violent robberies again
[03:40:50.400 --> 03:40:55.680]  government figures so for him to say mass migration is natural we just have to accept it's always been
[03:40:55.680 --> 03:41:04.080]  the case his absolute bonk once again in the uk meanwhile bright bar reports great replacement
[03:41:04.880 --> 03:41:11.200]  uk government considers rural visa for migrants amid declining native populations there are now
[03:41:11.200 --> 03:41:19.360]  over 400 i think it's 418 hotels many of which are four and five star many of which are in prime
[03:41:19.360 --> 03:41:26.080]  central tourist locations in british towns where they're at a cost of seven million dollars per
[03:41:26.080 --> 03:41:32.800]  day to the taxpayer housing migrants who show up in boats from france about half of those migrants
[03:41:32.800 --> 03:41:38.880]  are from albania a completely peaceful country not at war and it's absolute chaos they have nowhere
[03:41:38.880 --> 03:41:43.680]  to put these migrants they're putting them up in hotels causing massive problems in the surrounding
[03:41:43.680 --> 03:41:51.360]  areas where people live sexual assaults violent attacks the usual fruits of diversity well now
[03:41:51.360 --> 03:41:56.560]  rather than implementing policies to enable families and boost the native population the
[03:41:56.560 --> 03:42:01.680]  government is considering creating a rural visa to incentivize more migration to rural
[03:42:01.680 --> 03:42:06.880]  areas of the country bear in mind under the supposedly conservative government over the
[03:42:06.880 --> 03:42:14.640]  past year alone a million migrants legal migrants have come into the country our population is
[03:42:14.640 --> 03:42:20.080]  expanding rapidly these are legal migrants are getting access to free health care in many areas
[03:42:20.080 --> 03:42:25.920]  where you phone up the doctors you phone up the nhs at nine o'clock in the morning it's a lottery
[03:42:25.920 --> 03:42:32.240]  to even get a doctor's appointment giant waiting lists because of the outrage that was the covid

[03:46:50.160 --> 03:46:58.400]  promo code the destination is infowarstore.com and i thank you all for your support leading a frontal
[03:46:58.400 --> 03:47:03.280]  assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[03:47:03.280 --> 03:47:18.000]  live from london england it's paul joseph watson with summit.news
[03:47:21.040 --> 03:47:27.200]  was tragedy yesterday in the uk teenager among four dead in migrant boat tragedy thankfully
[03:47:27.200 --> 03:47:32.960]  many of them were rescued but again you empower the criminal people smugglers to bring these people
[03:47:32.960 --> 03:47:38.240]  across in the first place you give them the red carpet taxi service to get them on shore you
[03:47:38.240 --> 03:47:44.400]  incentivize it all with free health care free money free accommodation and tragedy is gonna happen
[03:47:44.400 --> 03:47:50.880]  when mattio salvini in italy completely disincentivized the migrant route to italy he harbored the
[03:47:50.880 --> 03:47:59.200]  number of migrants drowning so disincentivizing it actually saves lives the uk government isn't
[03:47:59.200 --> 03:48:07.920]  disincentivizing it uk government arrests just 0.3 percent of illegal boat migrants they passed a law
[03:48:09.040 --> 03:48:13.840]  that makes it a crime to arrive in the uk without proper permission why wasn't that a law in the
[03:48:13.840 --> 03:48:19.440]  first place but fewer than 100 people across the english channel in small boats have been arrested
[03:48:19.440 --> 03:48:26.480]  for arriving illegally in the uk reports the bbc so the government is so pathetic they gave themselves
[03:48:26.480 --> 03:48:34.400]  the power to arrest all these illegal immigrants and they've arrested 0.3 percent of them absolutely
[03:48:34.400 --> 03:48:39.760]  incredible now they're just saying they're going to spread them out into the rural areas because
[03:48:39.760 --> 03:48:46.880]  people in towns and cities are getting sick of the social dislocation the crime the sexual assaults
[03:48:46.880 --> 03:48:53.200]  the violent attacks so now the government solution is well we'll just make towns and cities the entire
[03:48:53.200 --> 03:48:58.800]  country great idea because they paid france to stop them getting on the dinghies in the first
[03:48:58.800 --> 03:49:04.320]  place said we're going to increase the payments to france as i predicted that did absolutely sweet
[03:49:04.320 --> 03:49:12.720]  f a meanwhile zero hedge reports get woke go broke washington post staff meeting erupts into chaos
[03:49:12.720 --> 03:49:18.720]  as layoffs announced they've lost half a million subscribers in the past two years and they didn't
[03:49:18.720 --> 03:49:25.840]  expect you know any collateral damage after that absolutely incredible maybe its stories like this
[03:49:25.840 --> 03:49:32.560]  which tell you why the washington post is going broke washington post corrects op ed conflating
[03:49:32.560 --> 03:49:41.280]  lack of black argentinian footballers with history of black erasure so this far left
[03:49:41.280 --> 03:49:47.920]  professor at the university of texas had this washington post op ed published asking the question
[03:49:47.920 --> 03:49:55.360]  why doesn't the team have more black players well that's because argentina has a black
[03:49:55.360 --> 03:50:01.120]  population of far less than one percent so of course the argentinian football team
[03:50:01.760 --> 03:50:06.560]  not going to have many black players if your black population is a fraction of a percentage
[03:50:07.760 --> 03:50:13.040]  it's quite funny because actual argentinians then got onto twitter and said we're not a disney
[03:50:13.040 --> 03:50:20.880]  movie we don't do diversity hires for elite level sports competitions we pick the best players
[03:50:20.880 --> 03:50:26.960]  and in a country where 99 percent of the population is white those best players guess what they're
[03:50:26.960 --> 03:50:33.920]  going to be white but the washington post was forced into issuing an embarrassing correction
[03:50:33.920 --> 03:50:40.080]  pointing out that far less than one percent of the population of in argentina is black
[03:50:40.080 --> 03:50:46.720]  meanwhile another team to be knocked out the world cup over the past week was england which
[03:50:46.720 --> 03:50:52.320]  brings us to our next video it's called they're going home and it explains how england players
[03:50:52.320 --> 03:50:57.680]  taking the knee and genuflecting to all these message narratives didn't really help them in
[03:50:57.680 --> 03:51:02.880]  the competition this is called they're going home let's roll it is it coming home now england
[03:51:02.880 --> 03:51:07.360]  were knocked out of another major tournament after being beaten by france on saturday night in the
[03:51:07.360 --> 03:51:11.520]  world cup maybe they should have worried about killian mbappe as much as they worried about lgbt
[03:51:11.520 --> 03:51:16.640]  armbands england players started on their knees and ended on their knees during the group stage
[03:51:16.640 --> 03:51:21.200]  we witnessed the bizarre spectacle of england players taking the knee before they game with the
[03:51:21.200 --> 03:51:27.760]  united states while zero players from the country where take a knee was born chose to do the same
[03:51:27.760 --> 03:51:32.000]  gesture while england repeated the same cringe performative stunt in the second round still
[03:51:32.000 --> 03:51:36.400]  absurdly claiming it was a generic anti-racism gesture when in fact it's intimately linked to
[03:51:36.400 --> 03:51:42.000]  the black lives matter organization no players from senna gall whose team is entirely black
[03:51:42.000 --> 03:51:46.400]  took the knee are england getting knocked out of tournament solely for taking the knee obviously it
[03:51:46.400 --> 03:51:51.440]  would be stupid to say that's the only reason but a sports psychologist will tell you any mental
[03:51:51.440 --> 03:51:56.640]  advantage you can gain over the opposition even if it's just a fraction of a percentage can be the
[03:51:56.640 --> 03:52:02.160]  slim margin between winning and losing i mean think of the optics you're literally on your knee
[03:52:02.160 --> 03:52:07.680]  displaying inferiority to the other team in england's case right before their biggest game of the
[03:52:07.680 --> 03:52:12.640]  tournament against the best team they faced france didn't take the knee and they didn't get involved
[03:52:12.640 --> 03:52:17.920]  in any of the virtue signaling politics their goalkeeper hugo larice said he respected the
[03:52:17.920 --> 03:52:22.400]  house country katar's wishes when it came to displaying support for the rainbow people england
[03:52:22.400 --> 03:52:27.120]  chose to get embroiled in all of that as did germany who didn't even get through the group
[03:52:27.120 --> 03:52:32.080]  stage losing to japan after staging this cringe photo op before the game i mean the new
[03:52:32.080 --> 03:52:40.560]  zealand rugby team does the hacker before games for a reason it intimidates the opposition and it
[03:52:40.560 --> 03:52:44.880]  gets inside their heads what does take a knee achieve all it does in that you look weak and
[03:52:44.880 --> 03:52:49.440]  pathetic you're already psychologically on the backfought before you even kick off now the
[03:52:49.440 --> 03:52:55.200]  speculation turns to welkiston chief manager gareth southgate after failing to win three major
[03:52:55.200 --> 03:53:00.720]  tournaments with possibly the best england team ever will he keep his job would any premier league
[03:53:00.720 --> 03:53:05.680]  team take gareth southgate as their manager no because he's not a particularly good manager
[03:53:05.680 --> 03:53:11.280]  he's a yes man a politician a safe pair of hands when it comes to talking about racism
[03:53:11.280 --> 03:53:17.600]  diversity and inclusivity a loyal servant when it comes to amplifying regime messaging you know
[03:53:17.600 --> 03:53:21.600]  all the important things to consider when you're trying to compete in an elite level competition
[03:53:21.600 --> 03:53:26.720]  there's still a mystery as to why southgate chose black players to take crucial penalties during
[03:53:26.720 --> 03:53:32.400]  the euro 2021 final with italy seemingly ignoring better options players who had experience of
[03:53:32.400 --> 03:53:37.200]  taking penalties at club level and despite hardly any other teams taking a knee at the world cup
[03:53:37.200 --> 03:53:41.680]  and with the premier league having largely dispensed with the gesture southgate insisted it was
[03:53:41.680 --> 03:53:46.480]  important for his players to just keep doing it and yet again instead of it coming home
[03:53:46.480 --> 03:53:50.880]  the team is coming home after another abject failure but hey if the winners were decided on
[03:53:50.880 --> 03:53:59.040]  who best pushed the musherage england won now talking about weak and pathetic let's go to
[03:53:59.040 --> 03:54:04.320]  prince harry and this final video because the final three episodes of harry and meghan have
[03:54:04.320 --> 03:54:10.960]  dropped on netflix today this video is called well this is awkward because the reaction to it
[03:54:10.960 --> 03:54:17.440]  hasn't been quite what they expected let's roll the clip that harry and meghan netflix docuseries
[03:54:17.440 --> 03:54:22.000]  hasn't exactly gone to plan for them has it on the surface the numbers actually look quite good
[03:54:22.000 --> 03:54:26.960]  it's netflix's most viewed documentary in the first week of release ever more than 28 million
[03:54:26.960 --> 03:54:32.000]  households watched at least part of the series but the real measure of sentiment comes via a new
[03:54:32.000 --> 03:54:36.720]  you gov opinion poll it was carried out between wednesday and thursday last week so after all
[03:54:36.720 --> 03:54:41.280]  the trailers dropped and on the first day that the first three episodes were released and for harry
[03:54:41.280 --> 03:54:47.120]  and meghan it's not pleasant reading just one third of brit's 33 percent now hold a positive view of
[03:54:47.120 --> 03:54:52.640]  prince harry while three in five or 59 percent hold a negative opinion of it this represents a 13
[03:54:52.640 --> 03:54:58.160]  point drop since november his joint lowest score since you gov began tracking royal favorability
[03:54:58.160 --> 03:55:04.880]  in 2011 meghan markel has a favorability rating of minus 39 percent down seven percent if she keeps
[03:55:04.880 --> 03:55:09.760]  going she's gonna give prince andrew a run for his money the main talking point of the second trailer
[03:55:09.760 --> 03:55:16.880]  was meghan markel the actress fake crying on camera is this finally a sign that brit's are
[03:55:16.880 --> 03:55:23.360]  beginning to see through the scam that is emotional incontinence harry and meghan's entire shtick is
[03:55:23.360 --> 03:55:30.480]  formulated on the premise that overtly emoting alone is enough to prove victimhood that constantly
[03:55:30.480 --> 03:55:36.160]  playing the victim card and crying on camera is sufficient evidence enough to establish wrongdoing
[03:55:36.160 --> 03:55:41.440]  by the adversarial party in this case the royal family emotional incontinence has been weaponized
[03:55:41.440 --> 03:55:47.120]  by bad faith grifters for years it's an integral core component of identity politics and it's
[03:55:47.120 --> 03:55:53.040]  particularly odious for brit's because our entire national character is based on a healthy distrust
[03:55:53.040 --> 03:55:59.040]  towards people who overly emote stiff upper lip isn't just a cringe cliche that kind of strength
[03:55:59.040 --> 03:56:04.880]  against adversity stoicism is what built this country so to see harry and meghan try to deliberately
[03:56:04.880 --> 03:56:11.200]  subvert that in pursuit of their poor me pity party pr campaign is pretty insidious fact is
[03:56:11.200 --> 03:56:17.120]  though most people aren't buying it a 100 million dollar netflix docuseries from the people who just
[03:56:17.120 --> 03:56:23.120]  wanted to be left alone have spectacularly backfired fewer people like them and this has advanced
[03:56:23.120 --> 03:56:28.720]  the movement to strip harry and meghan of their royal titles entirely and that day can't come
[03:56:28.720 --> 03:56:36.560]  soon enough so this pair of narcissists still can't accept the fact that it's not about racism
[03:56:36.560 --> 03:56:41.680]  it's not about you know institutional identity politics it's about the fact that nobody likes
[03:56:41.680 --> 03:56:47.280]  them because they're fundamentally unlikeable people in the last three episodes he's now basically
[03:56:47.920 --> 03:56:52.880]  whining about his brother screaming and shouting at him throwing his own brother under the bus
[03:56:52.880 --> 03:56:58.080]  after throwing his father under the bus in the previous episodes but again people aren't buying
[03:56:58.080 --> 03:57:06.240]  it report mbc cbs abc cnn uh msnbc has spent just 14 minutes combined covering the twitter files
[03:57:07.200 --> 03:57:14.400]  again more important news to cover than literal coordinated collusion between the biden administration
[03:57:14.400 --> 03:57:21.520]  and big tech to censor key stories which obviously affected the outcome of the presidential election
[03:57:22.080 --> 03:57:27.280]  not going to get to these final news stories drag queen biden invited to white house previously
[03:57:27.280 --> 03:57:31.840]  tweeted kids are out to sing and suck d those are the kind of individuals that are going to the
