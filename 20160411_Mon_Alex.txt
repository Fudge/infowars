[00:00.000 --> 00:08.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, April 11th, 2016.
[00:08.920 --> 00:12.880]  This will probably be the most important broadcast we've ever done up until this date.
[00:12.880 --> 00:18.840]  And I'm serious when I say that we have massive information that could bring down the globalist
[00:18.840 --> 00:24.800]  if the people realize how powerful the information is.
[00:24.800 --> 00:25.800]  It's up to you.
[00:25.800 --> 00:29.320]  Tell your neighbors, your friends, your coworkers, your family to tune in.
[00:29.320 --> 00:32.280]  We're going to a John Bowne special report on victim disarmament.
[00:32.280 --> 00:35.040]  Then we're coming back to launch the main transmission.
[00:35.040 --> 00:37.160]  This is the Info War.
[00:37.160 --> 00:39.240]  Another shooting on a military base.
[00:39.240 --> 00:43.560]  As an apparent murder suicide occurred when an airman shot his commanding officer.
[00:43.560 --> 00:48.400]  The official statement read there is an active shooter situation at Joint Base San Antonio
[00:48.400 --> 00:51.000]  Lackland Medina Annex and Base.
[00:51.000 --> 00:55.720]  And local authorities are on the scene at this time, meaning the local police.
[00:55.720 --> 00:59.720]  All schools and child development centers are currently locked down and there have been
[00:59.720 --> 01:02.400]  no injuries confirmed at this time.
[01:02.400 --> 01:07.560]  There are no indications that this was a terrorist attack yet another pointless announcement
[01:07.560 --> 01:13.000]  that it wasn't a terrorist attack yet another nearby school put on lockdown and left defenseless
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.400]  even if it was a possible terrorist attack since 1994.
[01:17.400 --> 01:22.760]  It's been a nonstop killing spree of drive by shootings by radical Islamists and disgruntled
[01:22.760 --> 01:27.640]  subordinate soldiers, including the apparent murder suicide that took place today at San
[01:27.640 --> 01:29.800]  Antonio's Lackland Air Force Base.
[01:29.800 --> 01:35.760]  There have been 21 such incidents, including the November 2009 Fort Hood massacre when
[01:35.760 --> 01:41.120]  Major Nadal Malik Hassan carried out the largest mass murder at a military installation in
[01:41.120 --> 01:45.000]  American history, killing 13 and wounding 32.
[01:45.000 --> 01:48.560]  So which new world order puppet got us into this situation?
[01:48.560 --> 01:53.000]  According to the Washington Times, one of the first things Bill Clinton did upon taking
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.560]  office in 1993 was to disarm US soldiers on military bases.
[01:58.560 --> 02:04.800]  So in March 1993, the Army imposed regulations forbidding military personnel from carrying
[02:04.800 --> 02:10.000]  their personal firearms and making it almost impossible for commanders to issue firearms
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.480]  to soldiers in the US for personal protection.
[02:13.480 --> 02:18.920]  For the most part, only military police regularly carry firearms on base and their presence
[02:18.920 --> 02:22.760]  is stretched thin by high demand for MPs and war zones.
[02:22.760 --> 02:27.320]  Meanwhile, gun-free zones in general are devastating Americans.
[02:27.320 --> 02:35.160]  The left just went into paroxysms of distress, the idea that somehow they were going to
[02:35.160 --> 02:37.680]  be responsible for race riots.
[02:37.680 --> 02:39.880]  Well, they've already happened.
[02:39.880 --> 02:43.920]  Can you spell Ferguson or Baltimore?
[02:43.920 --> 02:49.160]  And it's going to get worse unless they ease up on their anti-gun policies.
[02:49.160 --> 02:55.200]  And I think you're absolutely right, Chicago is just an explosion waiting to happen.
[02:55.200 --> 03:00.400]  Rahm Emanuel has a very tenuous hold on power there.
[03:00.400 --> 03:07.160]  His gun control policies are a total failure that if guns are so bad, tell the Secret Service,
[03:07.160 --> 03:11.040]  tell whoever your bodyguards are, hey, put those guns away.
[03:11.040 --> 03:13.640]  It only makes violence more likely.
[03:13.640 --> 03:16.720]  It's not the way to solve problems.
[03:16.720 --> 03:18.240]  Can't we just talk about them?
[03:18.240 --> 03:24.800]  And that's okay for you and me when they're talking to us, but they obviously don't believe
[03:24.800 --> 03:28.000]  that because they don't put that into practice.
[03:28.000 --> 03:36.680]  These people are just really too much, reiterating the call to keep the bases gun-free zones.
[03:36.680 --> 03:40.600]  Well, you know, that's really ignorant.
[03:40.600 --> 03:48.800]  That is making policy out of wishes and unicorns and other fairy tales rather than looking
[03:48.800 --> 03:54.920]  at what has actually happened, that all of our mass murders save a couple since 1950
[03:54.920 --> 03:57.320]  have occurred in gun-free zones.
[03:57.320 --> 04:02.560]  And yet we've got men, I guess women too, that have been in charge of training and leading
[04:02.560 --> 04:09.160]  people in battle, and yet they are so afraid of guns that they don't think that an E-1
[04:09.160 --> 04:13.400]  should have a firearm on a military base, really?
[04:13.400 --> 04:19.800]  13 people killed, including a pregnant soldier and 32 shot, none of whom received the Purple
[04:19.800 --> 04:24.800]  Heart or any of the additional veterans, medical and financial benefits given those wounded
[04:24.800 --> 04:30.120]  or killed in war because the military, to the outrage of the victims, has apparently
[04:30.120 --> 04:32.880]  deemed this workplace violence.
[04:32.880 --> 04:38.760]  And as military suicide numbers rise, it took six years for the dead and the wounded at
[04:38.760 --> 04:42.440]  Fort Hood to rightfully be awarded a Purple Heart.
[04:42.440 --> 04:47.880]  Today's murder, suicide in San Antonio is a blunt reminder that Bill Clinton's Road
[04:47.880 --> 04:51.280]  Scholar New World Order policy isn't working.
[04:51.280 --> 05:04.800]  Well, it's official, the GOP establishment has cancelled the Colorado Caucus because
[05:04.800 --> 05:06.600]  they don't want Trump to win a free election.
[05:06.600 --> 05:11.000]  That's right, the party leaders are transforming our representational republic into an unelected
[05:11.000 --> 05:12.320]  autocracy in plain view.
[05:12.320 --> 05:16.080]  They're not even rigging the election behind the scenes, they're openly canceling it outright.
[05:16.080 --> 05:20.240]  It's almost too sensational to even put into words, the GOP establishment is killing the
[05:20.240 --> 05:23.520]  right to vote, perhaps the most sacred right held by millions of Americans.
[05:23.520 --> 05:26.560]  It's not even an exaggeration compared to this in Communist China.
[05:26.560 --> 05:30.320]  They're unelected Communist Party officials appoint unelected leaders to rule the country
[05:30.320 --> 05:31.920]  without the consent of the people.
[05:31.920 --> 05:34.360]  And that's exactly what just happened to Colorado.
[05:34.360 --> 05:38.120]  State GOP leaders appointed Ted Cruz as their presidential candidate without the consent
[05:38.120 --> 05:39.120]  of the people.
[05:39.120 --> 05:42.800]  This underscores something we've been reporting at infowars.com for a very long time.
[05:42.800 --> 05:46.920]  There's no real difference between the GOP establishment and the Democratic Party establishment.
[05:46.920 --> 05:51.160]  They both want to expand the size of government at the expense of your individual rights.
[05:51.160 --> 05:54.160]  In this time, the establishment has sacrificed your right to vote.
[05:54.160 --> 05:57.760]  It's time for you to realize what's really going on and to spread the word to everybody
[05:57.760 --> 05:58.760]  you know.
[05:58.760 --> 06:01.560]  This is Kit Daniels with infowars.com.
[06:01.560 --> 06:05.440]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save
[06:05.440 --> 06:10.920]  you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the Info War, a 360 win.
[06:10.920 --> 06:15.880]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[06:15.880 --> 06:17.520]  at infowars.com.
[06:17.520 --> 06:21.360]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[06:21.360 --> 06:25.440]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[06:25.440 --> 06:30.680]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders of about $50.
[06:30.680 --> 06:34.760]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[06:34.760 --> 06:36.560]  the products that you need each month.
[06:36.560 --> 06:41.160]  Just go to infowars.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship and
[06:41.160 --> 06:44.280]  choose how often you want us to send you another order.

[06:49.560 --> 06:50.960]  this is a sure win.

[07:01.600 --> 07:05.520]  Secret 12, Info Wars Lines, Vitamin B12 Formulation.
[07:05.520 --> 07:10.840]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed
[07:10.840 --> 07:11.840]  by the body.
[07:11.840 --> 07:16.640]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are
[07:16.640 --> 07:18.960]  known to have higher absorption rates.
[07:18.960 --> 07:24.080]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful
[07:24.080 --> 07:28.240]  form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[07:28.240 --> 07:34.960]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimental grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12, methylcobalamin,
[07:34.960 --> 07:39.200]  the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[07:39.200 --> 07:42.600]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[07:42.600 --> 07:44.680]  No needles, no injections.
[07:44.680 --> 07:46.200]  Don't take my word for it.
[07:46.200 --> 07:47.680]  Try it for yourself.
[07:47.680 --> 07:48.840]  Discover the secret.
[07:48.840 --> 07:49.840]  Secret 12.

[07:57.840 --> 08:04.000]  Info Wars Life, Secret 12.
[08:04.000 --> 08:15.800]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:15.800 --> 08:21.200]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[08:21.200 --> 08:27.080]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central, 12 noon to 4 p.m. Eastern.
[08:27.080 --> 08:30.400]  The return of course weeknights at 7 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[08:30.400 --> 08:38.800]  From Full Wars Nightly News, find the tales at infowars.com forward slash show.
[08:38.800 --> 08:46.160]  Let me just first put on screen before I launch into our top story, DrudgeReport.com's front
[08:46.160 --> 08:50.480]  page from last night in red letters.
[08:50.480 --> 08:55.440]  We put it out on tweet.
[08:55.440 --> 09:04.520]  Now, Drudge has the same headline up today, but last night I took a screenshot of it and
[09:04.520 --> 09:13.280]  I tweeted it out, Fury as Colorado has no primary or caucuses, Cruz celebrates voterless
[09:13.280 --> 09:14.280]  victory.
[09:14.280 --> 09:22.920]  And I said there, I predicted the election would be canceled and now it is infowars.com
[09:22.920 --> 09:25.960]  forward slash no primary.
[09:25.960 --> 09:29.280]  What will the controllers do next?
[09:29.280 --> 09:36.720]  And I ran out of characters so I had to put no question mark there.
[09:36.720 --> 09:39.360]  But no question marks even needed is kind of poignant.
[09:39.360 --> 09:42.640]  And then let's go to DrudgeReport today and look at the headline.
[09:42.640 --> 09:43.760]  Very emblematic.
[09:43.760 --> 09:46.400]  This is what all the newspapers in the country should say today.
[09:46.400 --> 09:48.960]  Instead, they just act like nothing happened.
[09:48.960 --> 09:49.960]  It's no big deal.
[09:49.960 --> 09:54.400]  The lack of news from yesterday and today, no one's saying it's a big deal.
[09:54.400 --> 10:00.480]  Fury as Colorado has no primary or caucuses, Cruz celebrates voterless victory.
[10:00.480 --> 10:07.040]  Now, I talk about a lot of different news issues and different cultural developments
[10:07.040 --> 10:10.880]  that I call rosetta stones or philosopher stones.
[10:10.880 --> 10:15.760]  But if you have this, you understand this, you can decode everything.
[10:15.760 --> 10:24.040]  A skeleton G, this is undoubtedly the biggest development when it comes to waking people
[10:24.040 --> 10:28.400]  up, I believe potentially we've ever seen.
[10:28.400 --> 10:32.640]  Now I've been on the year 21 years and used to maybe once a year, I'd say this is one
[10:32.640 --> 10:35.800]  of the biggest things we've ever covered.
[10:35.800 --> 10:42.400]  Now every few weeks, I say this now dwarfs what previously happened.
[10:42.400 --> 10:46.080]  I'm not saying that for theatrical purposes, look around you.
[10:46.080 --> 10:53.360]  Things get more over the top, more naked, more arrogant, more criminal, just gripping
[10:53.360 --> 10:59.320]  with bravada and hootspa and every other form of hubris.
[10:59.320 --> 11:06.280]  Then I ask what's coming next and boy, let me tell you, I spent hours last night researching,
[11:06.280 --> 11:10.720]  I spent hours this morning and I sat here going over over 200 news articles that are
[11:10.720 --> 11:14.000]  in front of me and it is wild.
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.120]  All over the Western world, they're shutting down free speech.
[11:17.120 --> 11:20.440]  All over the Western world, they're persecuting Christians.
[11:20.440 --> 11:23.160]  All over the Western world, they're breaking up families.
[11:23.160 --> 11:27.280]  All over the Western world, they're engaged in forced inoculations and just taking money
[11:27.280 --> 11:32.640]  out of people's bank accounts and extra judicial secret police activities.
[11:32.640 --> 11:38.280]  Germany's reactivated the Stasi, they're merging with Facebook and Microsoft and Apple merging
[11:38.280 --> 11:44.400]  with the Communist Chinese, openly meeting, declaring their war on free speech globally.
[11:44.400 --> 11:49.560]  It is staggering, staggering.
[11:49.560 --> 11:58.000]  We're going to cover it all today.
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.560]  We have a filmmaker, Joe Gilbert, who's had the three Democrats on the FEC committee,
[12:02.560 --> 12:06.760]  that's half of Federal Elections Commission, called for his criminal indictment for putting
[12:06.760 --> 12:11.600]  out a film criticizing Obama during the 2012 election, saying that political speech now
[12:11.600 --> 12:16.960]  is any film or speech and that it's criminal, if it doesn't follow their election rules.
[12:16.960 --> 12:21.440]  They want to shut down this show, we've been listed, Drudge has been listed perennially
[12:21.440 --> 12:29.120]  as the lead main elephant, they can take that down, they get everybody.
[12:29.120 --> 12:31.320]  It's just all happening.
[12:31.320 --> 12:35.560]  And you would think, even though I knew this was all coming, that I'd be able to grasp
[12:35.560 --> 12:45.720]  it once it started happening, but I'll be honest, I am dumbfounded, polaxed, flabbergasted,
[12:45.720 --> 12:52.440]  shocked.
[12:52.440 --> 13:01.260]  Because there's so many facets to this, they're not just stealing the election publicly.
[13:01.260 --> 13:07.240]  It's how they're selling it with this unified wall of disinformation.
[13:07.240 --> 13:15.680]  I was on the elliptical this morning and monitored Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC, and I've never seen
[13:15.680 --> 13:16.680]  such unity.
[13:16.680 --> 13:18.720]  They don't really act like they're fighting each other.
[13:18.720 --> 13:26.640]  I flipped from channel to channel, and they were going, it's ridiculous.
[13:26.640 --> 13:32.000]  Just making a big deal out of the fact that they just canceled the election in Colorado
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.600]  and gave all 34 delegates to Ted Cruz, big deal.
[13:35.600 --> 13:41.600]  And by the way, is what he's doing calling for violence, is he a troublemaker?
[13:41.600 --> 13:46.280]  Is this more hate?
[13:46.280 --> 13:50.560]  And then I saw a clip on the news, and I knew it was covered on the news Sunday because
[13:50.560 --> 13:58.000]  I have the news articles and the clips, but they said it again, on CNN, will there be
[13:58.000 --> 14:06.280]  criminal charges for Roger Stone for calling for violence at the RNC?
[14:06.280 --> 14:09.160]  And then I got a cold feeling in my spine.
[14:09.160 --> 14:11.880]  He never said anything like that, and they don't care.
[14:11.880 --> 14:13.160]  They're going to steal elections.
[14:13.160 --> 14:16.960]  They're going to install people, and they're openly threatening everyone.
[14:16.960 --> 14:19.040]  You don't come and you don't organize.
[14:19.040 --> 14:24.480]  And by the way, I'm in these news pieces last week, and this week, I'm mixed in with it,
[14:24.480 --> 14:26.920]  saying we're going to go demonstrate, we're going to go and say this is wrong, we're going
[14:26.920 --> 14:30.560]  to go talk to the delegate contingents that are having their own meetings, and they're
[14:30.560 --> 14:31.920]  meeting in hotels.
[14:31.920 --> 14:37.120]  We're going to go say, don't steal our vote, follow the law in common sense.
[14:37.120 --> 14:38.560]  We're going to go expose the hoax.
[14:38.560 --> 14:43.480]  And so they're trying to create this idea that it's Donald Trump and Alex Jones and
[14:43.480 --> 14:45.600]  Roger Stone that are bad.
[14:45.600 --> 14:49.400]  Real clear politics, that's from MSNBC.
[14:49.400 --> 14:54.520]  Former Cruz advisor, Rick Tyler on MSNBC, dangerous, Roger Stone should be banned from
[14:54.520 --> 14:59.240]  the convention, and they go on to call for his arrest.
[14:59.240 --> 15:07.200]  Yes, that is Gestapo tactics, as Donald Trump's new campaign head came out and said on Meet
[15:07.200 --> 15:14.560]  the Press.
[15:14.560 --> 15:21.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, look at this Denver Post headline, Colorado Republicans cancel
[15:21.960 --> 15:29.440]  presidential vote at 2016 caucus, and then they go on to act like it's a story about
[15:29.440 --> 15:30.920]  the price of milk or something.
[15:30.920 --> 15:38.840]  It's just totally nonchalant, but all the other articles, and there's hundreds of them,
[15:38.840 --> 15:44.840]  just go, oh man, this is totally normal.
[15:44.840 --> 15:47.880]  Conspiracy theorists, and a whole bunch of articles that says conspiracy theorists think
[15:47.880 --> 15:49.440]  they're having their votes stolen.
[15:49.440 --> 15:50.440]  That's mind control.
[15:50.440 --> 15:54.440]  It's like walking up to, say, a woman in a parking lot in front of 50 people and punching
[15:54.440 --> 15:58.520]  her right in the teeth, knocking her teeth out, and everybody goes, you just knocked
[15:58.520 --> 15:59.520]  that woman's teeth out.
[15:59.520 --> 16:00.520]  And you go, no, I didn't.
[16:00.520 --> 16:02.400]  You just sit there denying it with a straight face.
[16:02.400 --> 16:05.560]  I mean, it is mind control.
[16:05.560 --> 16:11.680]  And the Washington Post is calling for Roger Stone's arrest.
[16:11.680 --> 16:12.920]  There's the Washington Post.
[16:12.920 --> 16:18.920]  Could Donald Trump surrogate Roger Stone be charged with menacing GOP convention delegates?
[16:18.920 --> 16:19.920]  Menacing?
[16:19.920 --> 16:21.960]  He said, we're going to go out and we're going to talk to him.
[16:21.960 --> 16:22.960]  Let him know.
[16:22.960 --> 16:23.960]  Don't steal our vote.
[16:23.960 --> 16:27.040]  Now, let me just stop before I get into all this, okay?
[16:27.040 --> 16:31.080]  This is why I want you to call your neighbors, your friends, your family, your pastors, your
[16:31.080 --> 16:33.120]  bosses, your employees.
[16:33.120 --> 16:38.360]  Let's say you own an auto parts store.
[16:38.360 --> 16:44.440]  This is live right now, but we'll put a YouTube video up of it in a Facebook video later with
[16:44.440 --> 16:49.040]  how to stop the 2016 theft of the election, how to stop the canceling.
[16:49.040 --> 16:52.720]  And I want people to sit their employees down and show this to them.
[16:52.720 --> 16:59.080]  I don't care if you're a Republican, Democrat, who you are, this is the time to get involved
[16:59.080 --> 17:01.760]  and it's the time to hit the streets, folks, because let me tell you something.
[17:01.760 --> 17:05.720]  When they start canceling elections in front of everybody and then talking about arresting
[17:05.720 --> 17:12.120]  people that are going to try to protest it, baby, you're not going into the Soviet Union.
[17:12.120 --> 17:13.600]  You're not going into Nazi Germany.
[17:13.600 --> 17:15.080]  You're not going into Mao's China.
[17:15.080 --> 17:19.800]  Sweetheart, you are entering the gates.
[17:19.800 --> 17:23.840]  And I keep telling you historically, things escalate, they escalate, they escalate incrementally,
[17:23.840 --> 17:29.320]  going into corruption, going into totalitarianism, going into oligarchy, going into the system.
[17:29.320 --> 17:35.280]  But once you finally get a point, it's like putting a piece of paper on top of stove.
[17:35.280 --> 17:42.720]  You know, a modern, just heater stove and that piece of paper will yellow, it will brown,
[17:42.720 --> 17:44.560]  it will finally explode into flames.
[17:44.560 --> 17:47.680]  I only put that over a flame where it just kind of lights and then burns.
[17:47.680 --> 17:51.720]  It'll crisp and then flash into flame.
[17:51.720 --> 17:58.480]  And so the paper is brown, it is crinkling, it is about to blow into flame and it is the
[17:58.480 --> 18:03.800]  criminal foreign institutions and the Council on Foreign Relations and all these multinational
[18:03.800 --> 18:07.760]  groups that have written books and white papers and everything else, admitting how they take
[18:07.760 --> 18:08.760]  countries over.
[18:08.760 --> 18:15.000]  And now they've done this here and they are establishing a permanent central committee
[18:15.000 --> 18:16.000]  and a Politburo.
[18:16.000 --> 18:17.640]  And I want to explain something to people.
[18:17.640 --> 18:22.440]  I don't say that for rhetorical parallels to tyranny.
[18:22.440 --> 18:27.240]  I've looked at this and let me explain what's about to happen when we come back from break.
[18:27.240 --> 18:30.360]  That's why I'm so afraid of them coming after me or shutting me down, not because I'm physically
[18:30.360 --> 18:31.360]  afraid of it.
[18:31.360 --> 18:34.960]  I'm worried other people just aren't as astute as I am historically.
[18:34.960 --> 18:37.160]  They just don't understand the enemy like I do.
[18:37.160 --> 18:41.080]  Quite frankly, no one does except the enemy themselves.
[18:41.080 --> 18:42.680]  People are all specialists in what they do.
[18:42.680 --> 18:45.920]  They're not specialists in the general understanding.
[18:45.920 --> 18:48.760]  I know how they're going to take the country over.
[18:48.760 --> 18:59.920]  I predicted they would do this and now I know how to stop them using their own cultural template
[18:59.920 --> 19:05.520]  against them because it's true.
[19:05.520 --> 19:12.120]  But it's the only thing that can actually get into people's brains.
[19:12.120 --> 19:23.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is illegal to have the party cancel an election.
[19:23.800 --> 19:30.360]  When delegates are in dispute at a razor's edge, you can under party rules manipulate
[19:30.360 --> 19:31.520]  it.
[19:31.520 --> 19:35.640]  But you can't when it's someone winning by hundreds and hundreds of delegates and millions
[19:35.640 --> 19:43.360]  of votes start canceling caucuses and just having your delegates who are party officials
[19:43.360 --> 19:46.040]  set up by the party in the last 30 years take over.
[19:46.040 --> 19:50.480]  They put this rule in in the 70s, 40 years ago, 40 years ago exactly, the Republicans
[19:50.480 --> 19:51.480]  did.
[19:51.480 --> 19:52.480]  They never implemented it.
[19:52.480 --> 19:55.400]  So the hoax is saying this is legal and lawful.
[19:55.400 --> 19:56.400]  It's not.
[19:56.400 --> 20:10.680]  And now Trump's new chief of staff on the campaign has come out and said that.
[20:10.680 --> 20:12.240]  Remember Pearl Harbor.
[20:12.240 --> 20:17.320]  Now you can buy for the first time ever the 75th anniversary Pearl Harbor legal tender

[24:21.600 --> 24:28.240]  i want to play a few clips here and when i come back from break in the next long segment i'm going
[24:28.240 --> 24:33.200]  to lay out the proof that what the republican and democratic leadership is doing is illegal
[24:34.480 --> 24:40.560]  and i'm going to lay out the battle plan to stop them and defeat them now they've got cnn msnbc
[24:40.560 --> 24:48.720]  in the washington post real clear politics you name it has stories about arresting roger stone
[24:48.720 --> 24:54.000]  who by the way is on tomorrow i had very interesting talks with him last night this morning he's
[24:54.000 --> 25:05.200]  going to break giant news tomorrow here we're going to be playing a clip of basically the new
[25:05.200 --> 25:09.360]  head of the campaign there's a face-saving stuff for the other guy but we're going to play the
[25:09.360 --> 25:22.160]  clip of paul maniforte here in just a moment but when we come back i'm going to lay this out
[25:22.160 --> 25:26.400]  ladies and gentlemen i've gone into the federal election law and i've gone into the history of
[25:26.400 --> 25:35.040]  it and i've got all the government printouts and university printouts and i already knew this but
[25:35.040 --> 25:41.760]  i went and actually looked it up last night this morning again it is illegal from every
[25:41.760 --> 25:49.040]  angle what they're doing it's racketeering it's civil rights violations it's a gross massive
[25:49.040 --> 25:59.680]  fraud against the public it is embezzlement it is voter disenfranchisement can you imagine
[25:59.680 --> 26:05.760]  if they told black people in colorado you can't vote it would be the end of the world because
[26:05.760 --> 26:11.360]  people know about the history of not letting blacks vote well guess what every black republican
[26:11.840 --> 26:16.720]  in colorado was told they couldn't vote and so i'm telling paul watson but i'm telling everybody
[26:16.720 --> 26:22.560]  else my writers just go with it go with the voting rights act of 65 64 go with the civil
[26:22.560 --> 26:28.080]  rights act it's all about voting go with the history of jim crow go into it all ladies and
[26:28.080 --> 26:35.920]  gentlemen they try to say it's a federal crime not to let illegal aliens get driver's license
[26:35.920 --> 26:41.440]  and vote basically but then they're going to just tell an entire state you don't get to vote and now
[26:41.440 --> 26:48.720]  they're doing it in four other states and it's not even being announced you know the washington
[26:48.720 --> 26:52.960]  post uh from yesterday that i highlighted where i went through the states and in territories it's
[26:52.960 --> 26:57.040]  happening in and they're then they're using emergency law to do this so we're going to break
[26:57.040 --> 27:02.640]  it down but understand something just like they have tpp and secret treaties they just claim
[27:02.640 --> 27:10.080]  they're allowed to put us under that's all illegal and a fraud too but that's my point with the tpp
[27:10.080 --> 27:17.120]  if they can do that why not suspend an election why not and that's what they're doing they also
[27:17.120 --> 27:24.160]  bernie standards one mile Wyoming and another state they just gave it that's like seven states
[27:24.160 --> 27:28.960]  he's one they just give Hillary the delegates and they put it the news like it's normal see that's
[27:28.960 --> 27:33.120]  really the big issue here they're not just stealing it they are openly
[27:35.920 --> 27:40.800]  coming out and going how dare donald trump complain i mean i can't even believe the level of it
[27:41.440 --> 27:45.200]  let's go ahead and play the clip of donald trump who isn't even being hardcore enough he's saying
[27:45.200 --> 27:50.560]  it's not fair hey donald i know you guys listen you get talking points here and i'm i'm i'm i'm
[27:50.560 --> 27:54.960]  proud of that and i'm so proud to support you to have the whole global system against you i knew
[27:54.960 --> 28:02.080]  i made the right choice bring up the civil rights act bring up jim crowe bring up poll taxes and say
[28:02.080 --> 28:08.160]  look we had revolutions and civil wars over this and and and eisenhower had to send troops in so
[28:08.160 --> 28:13.120]  blacks could vote you've made everybody where they can't vote it's illegal i don't care what you claim
[28:13.120 --> 28:20.560]  i mean inside the party you need to be indicted he needs to bully pulp at that and it will destroy
[28:20.560 --> 28:26.160]  them let's go out to break with donald trump i watch bernie he wins he wins he keeps winning
[28:26.160 --> 28:31.360]  winning winning and then i see he's got no chance they always say he has no chance why doesn't he
[28:31.360 --> 28:37.840]  have a chance because the system is corrupt and it's worse than the republican side because i'm
[28:37.840 --> 28:45.040]  up millions of votes on cruise millions i don't mean like i'm up by two votes i'm up millions
[28:45.040 --> 28:53.680]  and millions of votes i'm up by hundreds and hundreds of delegates i go to louisiana i win
[28:53.680 --> 28:58.880]  louisiana and i say isn't that beautiful i love the people i sent them a note thank you very much
[28:58.880 --> 29:03.920]  i love you louisiana then i find out that i get less delegates than crews because of some nonsense
[29:03.920 --> 29:11.840]  going like no i'm telling you and i say this to the rnc and i say it to the republican party
[29:11.840 --> 29:16.160]  you're gonna have a big problem folks because there are people that don't like what's going on
[29:16.160 --> 29:22.880]  you know they don't like what's going on we've got a corrupt system it's not right we're supposed
[29:22.880 --> 29:30.640]  to be a democracy we're supposed to be we're supposed to be you vote and the vote means something
[29:30.640 --> 29:36.800]  all right you vote and the vote means something and there's more of the speech we'll play more
[29:36.800 --> 29:46.320]  later i'm gonna play his uh new campaign head roger stones business partner um coming up
[29:46.320 --> 29:50.880]  and when he says he says no what cruz is doing breaks the rules absolutely when you cancel we're on
[29:50.880 --> 29:58.880]  the march you're done the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network they are on the run
[30:01.040 --> 30:05.680]  today is monday april 11th and here's some of the latest news the obama administration has ordered
[30:05.680 --> 30:10.640]  the border patrol to release illegal still soaking wet from the real grand brandon judd president
[30:10.640 --> 30:14.960]  of the national border patrol council told the house committee that agents were given the order
[30:14.960 --> 30:20.560]  soon after president obama decided to limit immigration enforcement in 2014 mr judd revealed
[30:20.560 --> 30:25.120]  that illegal immigrants have learned to game the system by claiming they arrived before 2014
[30:25.120 --> 30:29.120]  because the obama administration gives lower priority to illegals who've been in the country
[30:29.120 --> 30:33.200]  for several years he said quote the illegals are still wet from the river and miles from any
[30:33.200 --> 30:37.920]  civilization and on their word alone we release them unless we physically saw them cross the river
[30:37.920 --> 30:42.800]  another news obama admitted he had no plans for libya after forcing qaddafi out of power libya has
[30:42.800 --> 30:47.360]  been a failed state since the end of the us led coalition in 2011 which created a power vacuum

[30:52.000 --> 30:56.240]  of operations to ship weapons of syria while steadily gaining control of libya's vast oil

[34:08.960 --> 34:15.040]  don't want to come out and admit how naked it is and how it's meant to have you positioned to have
[34:15.040 --> 34:22.160]  the nomination stolen from you and from us but we've gone way past those points you need to
[34:22.160 --> 34:28.480]  just go all the way this is a total criminal takeover and just point out fast and furious and the
[34:28.480 --> 34:31.920]  crimes of the government and say you don't expect justice from the justice department
[34:31.920 --> 34:39.520]  uh and then just go directly to the american people do a giant press conference and just
[34:39.520 --> 34:45.040]  break down the fact that this is the suspension of our country this is the end of america this is
[34:45.040 --> 34:51.120]  a tombstone for our country a demarcation line where you can mark the point when the collapse
[34:51.120 --> 35:00.480]  accelerated into oblivion so i'm gonna lay out some of the history i'm gonna lay out the facts
[35:00.480 --> 35:05.840]  i'm gonna do a presentation here in a couple minutes and then we're gonna take this video
[35:05.840 --> 35:08.400]  and put it together with all the articles and put out a special report on it
[35:13.280 --> 35:19.040]  they have really jumped the shark on this one if we break out of the trance and the malaise
[35:19.040 --> 35:32.720]  the morass the swamp the bayou i taste and i smell victory victory
[35:37.520 --> 35:46.000]  unbelievable uh the arrogance of the globalist has gone way too far
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.960]  and they're calling for arresting roger stone while playing clips of him on this show
[35:54.800 --> 35:56.160]  is unprecedented
[35:59.360 --> 36:02.480]  since i was about 18 i wanted to fight for this republic
[36:03.520 --> 36:08.160]  i knew the best way to do it would be to get involved in news and politics and my god i'm
[36:08.160 --> 36:12.320]  satisfied right now i'm very sad about the state of our world but i gotta tell you i can look in
[36:12.320 --> 36:18.400]  the mirror and tell myself buddy you gave it one hell of a shot i'm so proud that i've got the
[36:18.400 --> 36:23.680]  ancestors and the genetics to be a fighter and i'm not bragging i'm just saying this is what
[36:23.680 --> 36:29.680]  satisfies a man is being right being focused not being a coward not caring what the crowd says
[36:30.960 --> 36:34.240]  not being a sunshine patriot but a winner soldier
[36:34.240 --> 36:39.520]  here all hell is going to break loose folks you better get ready
[36:41.440 --> 36:45.680]  tyranny is already here and it's going to get bad they're taking the gloves off
[36:45.680 --> 36:48.560]  but i've looked at the enemy i've studied history i've watched their moves
[36:49.760 --> 36:54.240]  they can't help themselves they've bitten off way more than they chew
[36:56.080 --> 37:00.720]  the new world order is like a four foot pig me trying to eat a whole elephant
[37:00.720 --> 37:04.000]  no he doesn't have a refrigerator
[37:07.200 --> 37:09.760]  that thing's gonna rot before he ever gets around to it
[37:13.840 --> 37:18.080]  all right when something's this big i have trouble even getting into it and talking
[37:18.080 --> 37:20.480]  about it it's so epic i'm just gonna stop for a moment and call myself
[37:23.920 --> 37:27.680]  you see they don't want you to recognize how big this is what they've done and if they can do this
[37:27.680 --> 37:33.200]  trick this mind game have all their pundits act like it's normal go what's the big deal with donald
[37:33.200 --> 37:40.320]  trump yeah his uh shadow advisor his confidant says we ought to go protest well that's criminal
[37:40.320 --> 37:44.800]  we ought to arrest him yeah can you believe it everybody knows you need you don't vote in america
[37:44.800 --> 37:52.800]  i mean you know i mean what a discredited lot of traders from nsnbc to cnn to abc to just all of them
[37:52.800 --> 37:59.040]  i'm just thinking god i'm not one of these people and you ought to be proud of yourself too that you
[37:59.040 --> 38:03.440]  were awake you were involved their mind control didn't work on you are incredible listeners
[38:04.320 --> 38:08.240]  that's why i don't want you thinking me when you walk up to me in public or on the street
[38:09.040 --> 38:12.880]  and you got this light in your eyes looking at me like i'm something great when you're just as great
[38:12.880 --> 38:18.640]  as i am or greater it is humbling to have smart informed people of every race color and creed
[38:18.640 --> 38:24.640]  counting on me to fight the globalist well i'm counting on you too and thank you you're amazing
[38:25.520 --> 38:33.040]  you're fantastic i really feel sorry for the people though that just for whatever reason don't get it
[38:33.040 --> 38:40.880]  because they never had it they just lost their souls somehow to tv and the culture and never
[38:40.880 --> 38:46.480]  realized that life's a contact sport they've got to be in the arena they're just dead in the bleachers
[38:46.480 --> 38:52.720]  like zombies they look like they're alive but they're not we shouldn't laugh at them we shouldn't
[38:52.720 --> 38:59.520]  have to stain for them lord knows i do that all the time then i feel embarrassed because i'm making
[38:59.520 --> 39:07.920]  fun of victims and that's wrong so i'm going to lay this out very calmly and the best way i can
[39:07.920 --> 39:16.320]  here in just a moment first off though if you see the information we talk about if you understand
[39:16.320 --> 39:22.320]  what we're dealing with if you understand the historical point we're at i want to encourage
[39:22.320 --> 39:28.320]  you more than ever to be vocal and to be involved and one of the chief ways to do that is taking
[39:28.320 --> 39:33.200]  the videos and the articles and the tweets and the information we put out on the info wars
[39:33.200 --> 39:40.240]  platforms and the info wars project what we are project against globalism against tyranny
[39:40.240 --> 39:45.760]  against world slavery we are the pro-human project we are the information war of the people
[39:45.760 --> 39:54.720]  and it's the enemy and it's information war of lies you are the organic response to the enemy
[39:56.000 --> 40:00.480]  whether you want them to be your enemy or not they are your sworn enemy they are like wolves
[40:00.480 --> 40:04.480]  they are like wolves and see you as blind sheep
[40:11.200 --> 40:17.280]  and also it's more important than ever to go to infowarstore.com and support the broadcast so i
[40:17.280 --> 40:22.720]  can have the reporters in the field 24-7 so i can have the riders have the crew and be able
[40:22.720 --> 40:27.920]  to field the information we have and the research we have and to be able to do it in a competent
[40:27.920 --> 40:34.960]  fashion we've fallen on a lot we've had a lot of issues myself included but but our guts are in
[40:34.960 --> 40:38.560]  the right place our minds are in the right place our souls are in the right place and we're committed
[40:39.680 --> 40:44.400]  and when you buy the new updated hillary for present t-shirt backed by popular demand it's an
[40:44.400 --> 40:48.880]  update of the last one that was the collector's item this is a new shirt but it looks very similar
[40:48.880 --> 40:54.560]  because folks really really wanted it back so i'm keeping my word but barely as folks want it so
[40:54.560 --> 40:59.760]  much and i'll just admit that this is this is i'm showing to not ever going back on something and i
[40:59.760 --> 41:04.000]  kind of feel bad about doing this but everybody wants it if i change the info wars.com to red and
[41:04.000 --> 41:09.440]  put some more stuff on the front hillary for present 2016 till the end of time that part's
[41:09.440 --> 41:15.600]  been added but it looks like a classic election shirt and it's available at infowarstore.com
[41:15.600 --> 41:19.200]  it's another limited edition we'll just go through the this year or until she gets indicted
[41:19.200 --> 41:25.920]  so it's got a 4.9 review it's a very very hot shirt obviously it'll probably the best
[41:25.920 --> 41:31.280]  seller we've ever had now and these are all over the news all over the country want to thank all
[41:31.280 --> 41:34.240]  the folks that are out there taking action and standing up against this evil witch
[41:37.200 --> 41:44.000]  and then lastly the all new dna force plus is back and the new key ingredients listed on the side
[41:44.000 --> 41:49.600]  if you want to read about that new powerful ingredient same price an all new ultra-strength
[41:49.600 --> 41:54.640]  version of dna forces back in stock and enforce life.com or the new powerful ingredient for the
[41:54.640 --> 42:00.800]  same price as original dna force dna force has been sold out for months we expect to quickly
[42:00.800 --> 42:05.280]  solve this limited shipment dna forces loaded with patented bio pqq compound which is back
[42:05.280 --> 42:11.760]  by 175 clinical studies and extremely hard to secure look there's a reason why just one ingredient
[42:11.760 --> 42:18.640]  dna force costs around 30 000 per batch or 14 000 a kilo that's the bio pqq it's the true
[42:18.640 --> 42:24.000]  absorbable not synthetic type ingredients in dna force include a patented form of antioxidant
[42:24.000 --> 42:32.880]  coq10 the name's too long to pronounce bio pqq digestive enzymes amino boosting astragalus root
[42:32.880 --> 42:42.560]  palm granite extract plant-based reservatol resvers resveratol i'd say that right resveratrol
[42:42.560 --> 42:48.320]  there you go third time's the charm dna force is extremely hard to produce and when we run out
[42:48.320 --> 42:53.440]  we are often out of stock for months visit enforce life.com and get the all new dna force at enforce
[42:53.440 --> 42:58.480]  life.com before it sells out and at current sales it'll sell out in about a week and then we got more
[42:58.480 --> 43:05.120]  coming in a month it's been sold out for three months and it's our most expensive item the comparable
[43:05.120 --> 43:11.280]  formulas sold by medical doctors some of this stuff's prescription in europe is 300 to 400
[43:11.280 --> 43:16.640]  dollars some of it's 600 dollars because it's it's that powerful i mean it's it's it's been proven to
[43:18.080 --> 43:21.360]  i'll just go see what it's been proven to do it's all been approved by the lawyers and
[43:21.360 --> 43:26.720]  everybody up there on the site and just research this for yourself it's got 175 studies behind it
[43:26.720 --> 43:30.480]  what it does to your dna what it does the telomere is what it does to your
[43:30.480 --> 43:35.280]  mitochondrial dna the engines of the cell it is redonkulous how good it is
[43:36.800 --> 43:41.360]  i mean i cut my finger off i don't know 15 16 years ago and it was still numb on one side and
[43:42.000 --> 43:47.920]  took this for a few months it got numb sort of tingling kind of hurt and then it just a feeling
[43:47.920 --> 43:54.000]  came back it's completely back boom i mean it was the dna force for me and that's what it's
[43:54.000 --> 44:02.480]  patented and certified and proven to it's it's incredible it's and they put out synthetic versions
[44:02.480 --> 44:07.600]  of the bio pq q and things like that that doesn't do the same thing your body doesn't upload it this
[44:07.600 --> 44:16.800]  has the only organic bio pq q out there that there is and i can't call it organic because
[44:16.800 --> 44:21.920]  i'll just tell you a genetically engineered bacteria creates it okay the japanese have it
[44:21.920 --> 44:25.360]  and uh people say well i'm against genetic engineering you know no i'm against out of
[44:25.360 --> 44:31.840]  control i don't know what's going on so this this that's how this is produced and that's why it's
[44:31.840 --> 44:38.640]  bio identical it's the stuff that is in comets it's not of this world i'm not kidding you got
[44:38.640 --> 44:43.520]  to look it up it's amazing and all and the other stuff synthetics like 50 bucks a bottle
[44:43.520 --> 44:51.920]  for just a for just the bio pq q and it's not the stuff that's in the comments
[44:53.200 --> 44:57.760]  and out there in the kuiper belt so it's like the the makeup of the universe or something i don't
[44:57.760 --> 45:03.040]  know how to describe it you got to look into it for yourself it's amazing before they have to
[45:03.040 --> 45:12.080]  basically extract it out of 500 cartons of blueberries to make a dose of it okay it's only
[45:12.080 --> 45:17.040]  found in things like blueberries it's ridiculous okay i'm gonna stop right there i'm gonna stop
[45:17.040 --> 45:22.080]  talking about it it's just crazy how weird this universe is okay let's go back let's start over
[45:23.280 --> 45:24.320]  thank you for the support folks
[45:30.960 --> 45:35.040]  let's start back over with the donald trump clip then i want to play his new
[45:35.680 --> 45:41.760]  campaign head paul manfort those guys are all gentlemen they're not fighting with the current
[45:41.760 --> 45:45.680]  so-called head it's just that he really is even political after i told you about it you admitted
[45:45.680 --> 45:50.240]  that he's pretty much the new campaign head right on the show nothing against the other guy that's
[45:50.240 --> 45:53.520]  gotten in all the trouble and stuff i think he's been set up the point is is that this guy's an
[45:53.520 --> 46:00.480]  expert of actually how to win elections so quite frankly trump was advised on this whole strategy
[46:00.480 --> 46:06.720]  a year ago and was warned about all this and so that's why now trump's going okay and bringing
[46:06.720 --> 46:14.960]  these guys in but i'm just going to stop right there let's now break down
[46:19.520 --> 46:25.040]  how they plan to steal the election where all this is going and how we can stop them
[46:25.040 --> 46:31.120]  and you're not going to hear some of this information anywhere else it is guaranteed
[46:31.120 --> 46:37.120]  if other writers and other researchers and other talks show us and we the people pick up on this
[46:39.120 --> 46:46.400]  this is so hardcore so truthful so poignant so powerful it's game over so first let's go to
[46:47.120 --> 46:54.800]  trump talking about bernie sanders winning all these states but then from ioming to new hampshire
[46:54.800 --> 47:01.840]  they give him to hillary but if they hadn't stolen those states he'd be barely ahead of hillar trump
[47:01.840 --> 47:07.040]  is millions and millions of votes hundreds and hundreds of delegates ahead but when he wins
[47:07.040 --> 47:19.360]  louisiana tennessee arizona colorada and other states north dakota wyoming shamoa guam version
[47:19.360 --> 47:28.560]  islands it's all just being given to ted cruise and i got to say i've gone from not trusting
[47:28.560 --> 47:33.520]  ted cruise but wanting to like him because it was good voting record to absolutely just loathing him
[47:33.520 --> 47:38.560]  i mean the dirty tricks he did against karsten and then all the rest of it and then now
[47:41.040 --> 47:45.920]  stealing with the republicans and canceling elections it's unprecedented and they want us
[47:45.920 --> 47:51.120]  to just not notice this and not understand it that's the key we have to get upset and state that
[47:51.120 --> 47:55.040]  it's illegal and why and i'm going to go over that here in a moment but first year's donald's run
[47:55.680 --> 48:02.080]  so i watch bernie he wins he wins he keeps winning winning winning and then i see he's got no chance
[48:02.080 --> 48:07.520]  they always say he has no chance why doesn't he have a chance because the system is corrupt
[48:07.520 --> 48:13.840]  and it's worse than the republican side because i'm up millions of votes on cruise millions i don't
[48:13.840 --> 48:21.600]  mean like i'm up by two votes i'm up millions and millions of votes i'm up by hundreds and
[48:21.600 --> 48:29.440]  hundreds of delegates i go to louisiana i win louisiana and i say isn't that beautiful i love
[48:29.440 --> 48:34.080]  the people i sent them a note thank you very much i love you louisiana then i find out that i get
[48:34.080 --> 48:40.960]  less delegates than crews because of some nonsense going like no i'm telling you and i say this to
[48:40.960 --> 48:46.400]  the rnc and i say it to the republican party you're gonna have a big problem folks because
[48:46.400 --> 48:51.520]  there are people that don't like what's going on you know they don't like what's going on we've
[48:51.520 --> 49:00.160]  got a corrupt system it's not right we're supposed to be a democracy we're supposed to be we're supposed
[49:00.160 --> 49:06.560]  to be you vote and the vote means something all right you vote and the vote means something
[49:06.560 --> 49:12.240]  we are a constitutional republic which is a limited democracy and yes the delegates
[49:12.240 --> 49:17.680]  have always sworn at the point for the voters of the precinct that they represent that group of
[49:17.680 --> 49:23.120]  votes and the votes are tallyed together at the precinct and then put into that delegate who then
[49:23.120 --> 49:28.560]  goes and then 1972 for the democrats 76 for the republicans they changed the rule to create super
[49:28.560 --> 49:35.680]  delegates who they claim will just organize things there have been contested elections
[49:35.680 --> 49:45.760]  where it's neck and neck this is unprecedented but when they cancelled the colorata republican
[49:45.760 --> 49:51.120]  primary and others they disenfranchised voters and the public trust and the voting rights act of
[49:51.120 --> 49:59.920]  65 and brought back a form of jim crow against the entirety of the american people there has
[49:59.920 --> 50:04.960]  never in the history of this country been voted restriction of this level except saying blacks
[50:04.960 --> 50:12.000]  couldn't vote and that's what you parallel with it is trump ads we're gonna make some for them showing
[50:12.000 --> 50:17.520]  black slaves showing how they weren't allowed showing whites and blacks and others protesting
[50:17.520 --> 50:22.240]  for the right of blacks to be able to vote properly and to not have poll taxes and not be
[50:22.240 --> 50:29.600]  violated and then show how boom then they just cancel it in colorata and and the clips of the
[50:29.600 --> 50:35.040]  pundits saying it's no big deal ladies and gentlemen you don't just expose how it's connected to
[50:35.040 --> 50:40.560]  slavery that'll finally get people thinking yeah blacks couldn't vote was wrong now we can't vote
[50:40.560 --> 50:45.680]  or our vote doesn't count and then a party selects somebody and then we supposedly vote for that
[50:45.680 --> 50:50.800]  that's the communist pollut bureau system the soviet union would have elections
[50:50.800 --> 51:01.360]  but the candidates were approved by the pollut bureau that was approved by the central committee
[51:02.560 --> 51:06.400]  and i've got all the news articles on that i mean that's what this system is
[51:06.400 --> 51:13.280]  they're getting rid of our republic system and are bringing it in to say that the democrats and
[51:13.280 --> 51:16.880]  republicans they both decided to do it they both made a backroom deal because the other party could
[51:16.880 --> 51:25.680]  kill the other party pointing this out vice versa and so we have to point out this is illegal
[51:26.960 --> 51:27.840]  this is wrong
[51:30.560 --> 51:37.120]  you just as a party can't say you're allowed to change the rules because it's racketeering
[51:37.120 --> 51:42.080]  we have public election laws we have state and local laws we have taxpayer money spent on all the
[51:42.080 --> 51:52.160]  voting we have poll watchers we have all of these systems and international groups come here to
[51:52.160 --> 51:56.400]  monitor our elections if this was done in a third world country they'd call it the biggest scandal
[51:56.400 --> 52:04.080]  ever it would be the dictator of venezuela has canceled the elections the dictator of china has
[52:04.080 --> 52:09.200]  canceled elections cell chest you and romania has canceled elections you know he will now hold a sham
[52:09.200 --> 52:17.840]  where the party appoints who they want this is directly out of even banana boat uh third world
[52:17.840 --> 52:24.080]  countries have sham elections where they just stuffed the ballot box and announced whatever
[52:24.080 --> 52:27.760]  they want they're just dispensing with that entirely because they know it's hard to steal
[52:27.760 --> 52:33.360]  an election from a landslide so if we counter this and point this out and trump gets hardcore on this
[52:33.360 --> 52:40.400]  it's game over just because the party officials in both parties say they're allowed to change
[52:40.400 --> 52:48.960]  your rule really why didn't you do it in the 200 years before 1976 200 years before that the last
[52:48.960 --> 52:53.920]  40 you have it on the books but the first time you implement it now both parties to block two
[52:53.920 --> 53:02.960]  populist candidates one hardcore super leftist one kind of populist strong man fascist light
[53:02.960 --> 53:06.480]  i don't particularly like some of the stuff trumps doing but man they're scared of him
[53:07.040 --> 53:12.560]  they are really freaking out because they know he wants to actually be president
[53:14.000 --> 53:20.720]  he doesn't want to sell us out to a global system so here's paul manifold long time a business
[53:20.720 --> 53:25.760]  partner in their political uh operation with roger stone helped ronald reagan stop them stealing
[53:25.760 --> 53:31.600]  it from him in 1980 and in other big elections a top floor operative the best in the nation
[53:31.600 --> 53:39.680]  stone even says that he says he's even better than him and uh he's his partner and so stone and
[53:39.680 --> 53:44.640]  manifold are here to the rescue to counter all this and so they're calling for stones arrest in
[53:44.640 --> 53:50.960]  the washington post and cnn and msnbc and playing clips of yours truly implying i need to be arrested
[53:50.960 --> 53:55.040]  as well there's some sites saying that as well so i'm here exposing what they're doing calling for
[53:55.040 --> 53:59.280]  no violence and they want me arrested and basically say i'm calling for violence that's another little
[53:59.280 --> 54:09.520]  cherry on top of where we are okay now let's go to the manifold clip what is fair game to win a
[54:09.520 --> 54:13.520]  delegate it's threatening a fair game it's threats a fair game it's not my style it's not
[54:13.520 --> 54:18.080]  donald trump style what do you have to edit but it is but it is ted cruz's style and and that's
[54:18.080 --> 54:21.760]  going to wear thin very fast you think he's threatening delegates well he's threatening
[54:21.760 --> 54:26.160]  that there you go to these county conventions and you see the tactic gestapo tactics the
[54:26.160 --> 54:30.400]  scorcher to gestapo tactics they are that's a strong word well you look at so you we're
[54:30.400 --> 54:35.760]  going to be filing several protests because the reality is they are not playing by the rules but
[54:35.760 --> 54:40.800]  frankly that's the side game because the only game i'm focusing on right now is getting delegates
[54:40.800 --> 54:44.640]  and the games that have happened to you in this past weekend and you know are not
[54:45.760 --> 54:51.760]  are not important to the long-term game of how to get to 1237 and then he goes on in the longer
[54:51.760 --> 54:56.960]  clip uh it's on info wars dot com to say what they're doing breaks the rules we're going to fire
[54:56.960 --> 55:02.720]  follow more protest and notice the pundit from the clinton and obama white house who now hosts the
[55:02.720 --> 55:06.480]  show it's just all their operatives are in there is like our threats okay is this okay because they
[55:06.480 --> 55:10.720]  know millions of people are going to show up probably millions i'm going to be they want me
[55:10.720 --> 55:14.640]  to lead it i mean quite frankly i'm letting stone be the leader of it uh there's going to be a bunch
[55:14.640 --> 55:19.920]  of folks there and we are going to say no to this to being told that the person we voted for we
[55:19.920 --> 55:24.400]  can't have it's not normal to go demonstrate they're implying we want violence as we say
[55:24.400 --> 55:28.240]  we're going to go to these delegations we're going to go stay on the same hotels and when
[55:28.240 --> 55:31.120]  they're all walking around with their delegate cars we're going to walk up and say what are you doing
[55:31.120 --> 55:39.360]  that's our free speech that's gestapo tactics stealing our votes it's not gestapo tactics uh
[55:39.360 --> 55:46.480]  like they've got ted cruises operatives on cnn and msnbc say so here's the big news anybody
[55:46.480 --> 55:50.720]  can type into a search engine to go to countless universities go to the federal government websites
[55:50.720 --> 55:53.920]  library at congress and read about jim crow laws so let's go over these for people
[55:55.760 --> 56:00.400]  jim crow laws were enacted on a host of issues disarming blacks you name it first gun control
[56:00.400 --> 56:08.720]  laws were jim crow but they were mainly voting and it did everything from setting up labor unions so
[56:08.720 --> 56:13.520]  that you know they couldn't have blacks in them to not letting blacks basically run for office
[56:13.520 --> 56:17.840]  to making blacks pay a poll tax and also poor whites to shut them down
[56:20.320 --> 56:25.840]  and there were just all sorts of lawsuits and fights and people killed over this and finally
[56:27.280 --> 56:33.760]  by the 1974 quote 75 when it finally got signed into law voting rights act of 65
[56:35.280 --> 56:40.800]  jim crow was abolished you read the stuff in jim crow it's nothing compared to just saying
[56:40.800 --> 56:48.160]  the party's allowed to cancel a vote think about this if a party can really cancel a primary
[56:48.880 --> 56:53.600]  in all these states they're doing it or steal them after the fact they have suspended the real
[56:53.600 --> 57:00.960]  election think about that and they are now the leaders of the country and will bestow on their
[57:00.960 --> 57:11.360]  surrogates their legates their children endlessly just like cuba or north korea or where these
[57:11.360 --> 57:15.760]  communist generals are billionaires in china and their grandkids are billionaires and they just
[57:15.760 --> 57:21.200]  own the country because they're on the central committee that was set up in 1927 they are three
[57:21.200 --> 57:27.040]  to four generations down in the communist central committee and it's almost all the children and
[57:27.040 --> 57:34.560]  grandchildren of the original people in 1927 that were in the mountains of china didn't even take
[57:34.560 --> 57:44.160]  over till 49 they are a hereditary rulership so go read about jim crow and connect it to this
[57:44.160 --> 57:49.520]  that hey if blacks are having their right to vote taken and it was basically wars over it
[57:49.520 --> 57:57.920]  and eisenhower sending troops in so they could vote in 1958 what's going on now you see well go
[57:57.920 --> 58:02.480]  read the central committee of the communist party of china go read the pollut bureau of the communist
[58:02.480 --> 58:09.200]  party of china the central committee then appoints these people and then they decide
[58:09.200 --> 58:12.640]  to the president is i mean it's totally rigged this is what we're going into
[58:12.640 --> 58:22.720]  it this is the end of our country people and both parties are doing it now on purpose to set the
[58:22.720 --> 58:27.920]  precedent at completely normal and then just go oh yeah and then now suddenly everyone wants to be a
[58:27.920 --> 58:32.320]  delegate and how do i become a delegate it's like the new royalty and these delegates are all on
[58:32.320 --> 58:37.680]  power trips because they're part of the party and they get to go on golf trips and steak houses i
[58:37.680 --> 58:43.600]  mean this is so sick folks talk about oligarchy this is it get this out to everybody stay with us

[1:00:33.040 --> 1:00:38.560]  can you keep him in the dark for life and i know he's a listener too but we've sent him emails and
[1:00:38.560 --> 1:00:41.520]  stuff and their people won't give it to him he won't come on the show stop talking to folks
[1:00:41.520 --> 1:00:47.920]  no i'm he's a luster pretty crazy i'm at glendanzik people say that guy's evil at least he wears it
[1:00:47.920 --> 1:00:52.000]  openly on his sleeve and that's not what i think he's really doing no i think he's pretty much
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:56.480]  fallen to it something he thought even trolley couldn't no the people that are evil the people
[1:00:56.480 --> 1:01:12.400]  that act like they're good out in the open and are wicked inside crank it up
[1:01:12.400 --> 1:01:26.240]  yeah not about to kneel to the globalist
[1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:28.240]  all right that's enough
[1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:37.440]  that's right you think the globalists are gonna be able to successfully shut down humanity
[1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:44.160]  and play these games they're open naked power grab instead of stealing elections and and manipulating
[1:01:44.160 --> 1:01:53.280]  them behind the scenes is a devastating succulent delicious victory like the most juicy rib eye steak
[1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:59.360]  you've ever seen dripping with grease and a giant baked potato that you just split open steaming
[1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:06.240]  and dump the dump the sour cream and chives and bacon bits into we really need to realize the
[1:02:06.240 --> 1:02:13.120]  victories we're having with the enemy and their biggest camouflage is to act like they're invincible
[1:02:13.120 --> 1:02:16.480]  and all powerful so they just act more arrogant the weaker they get
[1:02:20.320 --> 1:02:28.160]  they are flailing around all over the world now that said uh they could start some big wars and
[1:02:28.160 --> 1:02:32.080]  really pull the trigger and stuff's gonna get nasty that's why we've got to work like the
[1:02:32.080 --> 1:02:38.000]  dickens right now we've got to work as as as hard as charles dickens did they say 20 hours a day
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:42.560]  with this passion for writing we've got to work like the dickens to defeat these people to affect
[1:02:42.560 --> 1:02:49.520]  the future battle space to expose them because humanity is now ready to hear the truth you
[1:02:49.520 --> 1:02:55.440]  probably notice i'm pretty animated today more energy than usual i do not even feel worthy to
[1:02:55.440 --> 1:03:01.600]  be bringing you this type of information i mean this is historical huge what's happening i know i
[1:03:01.600 --> 1:03:08.480]  keep going back to that but let's put drudge report dot com back up on screen info wars dot com
[1:03:09.200 --> 1:03:14.400]  and drudge report are basically the only sites over the weekend flipping out and freaking out now
[1:03:14.400 --> 1:03:18.400]  finally the tail's wagging the dog as usual mainstream media is having to say okay folks are
[1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:24.000]  mad they just don't understand the process and the party has rules no we get the party sees control
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:28.800]  and wrote some rule kind of like the clinton's with the republican leadership in the 90s changed
[1:03:28.800 --> 1:03:34.880]  the rules so uh big mega banks could create derivatives garbage trillions and trillions of it
[1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:39.840]  and sign taxpayers onto it no no we get you guys wrote yourself a piece of paper up saying you're
[1:03:39.840 --> 1:03:47.360]  allowed to rape us and we're telling it shove it where the sun doesn't shine stick it in your pipe
[1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:52.240]  get out of our way go jump in the lake fly a kite you know what i mean don't you
[1:03:53.600 --> 1:03:58.160]  you're a pack of criminals and let's go to my tweet last night with a shot of drudge report
[1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:02.640]  don't you got the same headline up there is he interested because it's just so epic fury is color
[1:04:02.640 --> 1:04:08.320]  rata has no primary or caucus cruise celebrates vultures victory click on the story we posted
[1:04:08.320 --> 1:04:12.960]  this article yesterday yeah just click on that link right there thank you on the show tv viewers
[1:04:12.960 --> 1:04:16.720]  i'll read it for radio listeners those don't article we posted from politico no primary no
[1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:20.480]  caucuses cruise gets all colorado delegates now let's scroll down now politico didn't go with
[1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:24.880]  that headlines what the article says drudge gave it that headline and then you see my videos from
[1:04:24.880 --> 1:04:30.400]  months ago april first march 28 that goes back even months before that where i started using the term
[1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:35.600]  they're canceling the election this is a canceling and then here is the headline
[1:04:37.840 --> 1:04:45.680]  colorado republicans cancel presidential vote at 2016 caucuses the denver post that's what it is
[1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:52.400]  they're canceling it and bringing you ceremonial candidates and stand-ins directly out of the
[1:04:52.400 --> 1:04:59.440]  bolshevik central committee politburo model i'm not using that example for rhetoric that's what it is
[1:05:00.960 --> 1:05:04.880]  well it's official the gop establishment has canceled the colorado caucus because they don't
[1:05:04.880 --> 1:05:09.440]  want trump to win a free election that's right the party leader transforming our representational
[1:05:09.440 --> 1:05:13.360]  republic into an unelected autocracy in plain view they're not even rigging the election
[1:05:13.360 --> 1:05:17.600]  behind the scenes they're openly canceling it outright it's almost too sensational to even
[1:05:17.600 --> 1:05:21.840]  put into words the gop establishment is killing the right to vote perhaps the most sacred right
[1:05:21.840 --> 1:05:26.240]  held by millions of americans it's not even an exaggeration compared to this to communist china
[1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:30.240]  they're unelected communist party officials appoint unelected leaders to rule the country
[1:05:30.240 --> 1:05:34.240]  without the consent of the people and that's exactly what just happened to colorado state
[1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:38.720]  gop leaders appointed ted cruz as their presidential candidate without the consent of the people this
[1:05:38.720 --> 1:05:43.040]  underscores something we've been reporting at info wars dot com for a very long time there's no real
[1:05:43.040 --> 1:05:47.360]  difference between the gop establishment and the democratic party establishment they both want to

[1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:50.000]  like we're seeing the republican party and the democratic party take the delegates from
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.960]  donald trump and bernie sanders and i don't like sanders and i have some problems with
[1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:57.360]  trump but he's a nationalist and i had like cruz before and i know our guests likes cruz but
[1:11:57.360 --> 1:12:06.000]  here's the deal you can't as paul manifold said i'll meet the press you can't just cancel an election
[1:12:07.200 --> 1:12:10.800]  they're supposed to represent the delegates if it's neck and neck some things can happen but

[1:15:13.040 --> 1:15:20.560]  so for now he's okay i've seen 10 different senators and a bunch of zars we've done articles on it
[1:15:20.560 --> 1:15:25.680]  and listed them calling for drudge to be shut down because he's a conservative and points out
[1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:30.080]  their lives he has a right as a news person just like you can write a column to have his view in
[1:15:30.080 --> 1:15:36.720]  america that's not campaign money my free speech oh but revin right can say gd america kill the
[1:15:36.720 --> 1:15:41.760]  white he's all this garbage that's okay speech and the persecution the irs is done against christians

[1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:19.040]  we're already way down the rat hole in something never before seen we got to wake up out of the
[1:16:19.040 --> 1:16:24.720]  trance realize what's happening and get upset dreams of my real father and then they're going
[1:16:24.720 --> 1:16:29.600]  after him for the one he made for the election that there's no place like utopia saying obama's
[1:16:29.600 --> 1:16:34.880]  really a communist obama went down to argentina two weeks ago let's get that clip ready too and said
[1:16:34.880 --> 1:16:38.800]  there's no difference really between communism and capitalism and choose whatever you want
[1:16:40.560 --> 1:16:45.120]  see i mean it's he went to cuba and stood in front of shea guavara that said black people
[1:16:45.120 --> 1:16:54.720]  weren't humans and native americans were roaches do you have any idea how racist the communists
[1:16:54.720 --> 1:16:58.880]  are in latin america let's go to joel govern we're going to break here in a few minutes but i tell
[1:16:58.880 --> 1:17:05.520]  you joel i am almost speechless that i can't come up with words to describe how serious all this is
[1:17:05.520 --> 1:17:10.800]  i just laid out a continuum there of just a smattering i've got stacks of stuff i've even
[1:17:10.800 --> 1:17:16.320]  gotten to today tell people what they try to do to you what they're currently doing uh and i gotta
[1:17:16.320 --> 1:17:20.160]  say i'm a little bit jealous that they're not trying to indict me i mean i you really get a
[1:17:20.160 --> 1:17:25.920]  nerve talking about talking about dad didn't you yeah alex uh you hit it on the nose i mean don't
[1:17:25.920 --> 1:17:31.840]  worry you're not far behind you know i'll see you in the gulag apparently uh look we're hanging in
[1:17:31.840 --> 1:17:40.160]  the balance between being and staying a constitutional republic and living under liberal fascism uh the
[1:17:40.160 --> 1:17:46.400]  supreme court now is tied at four to four between leftists who vote radical ideology versus
[1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:50.720]  constitutionalists now what happened to me on the fec is the federal election commission
[1:17:50.720 --> 1:17:58.480]  uh regulates political speech uh and but they have an exemption for media for you talk radio
[1:17:58.480 --> 1:18:06.240]  drudge me michael more uh fox news cnn we can have political speech all we want and express
[1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:12.400]  opinions on political figures myself as a journalist and documentarian uh at any time without
[1:18:12.960 --> 1:18:17.760]  registering ourselves and telling who our donors are and so on according to fec rules
[1:18:17.760 --> 1:18:24.640]  now the federal election commission uh judged a complaint against me and the case was already
[1:18:24.640 --> 1:18:30.960]  settled when michael more citizens united this was settled law and i had a lot of people emailed
[1:18:30.960 --> 1:18:37.040]  me and said hey congratulations you beat the fec and i said wait it was three to three three to
[1:18:37.040 --> 1:18:43.840]  three if they had a john roberts character uh who compromised on the republican side or if
[1:18:43.840 --> 1:18:50.320]  hillary gets to uh to take office and simply adds an extra democrat commissioner then they
[1:18:50.320 --> 1:18:55.520]  would what would happen next is they would call me in to the fec with my lawyer they would impose
[1:18:55.520 --> 1:19:00.080]  a fine let's say a hundred two hundred thousand dollars and i would have to agree to restrict
[1:19:00.080 --> 1:19:05.440]  my free speech in the future that i can't make documentary films for example if i don't agree
[1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:10.800]  to their settlement then they would refer me to the justice department for criminal charges
[1:19:10.800 --> 1:19:15.840]  and that was in the complaint now it came out three to three so we're literally hanging in
[1:19:15.840 --> 1:19:21.120]  the balance uh and these may be the last days of our constitutional republic that we're we're
[1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:24.960]  enjoying and as you say watching you go down the rat hole the fact that they even consider
[1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:31.520]  to complain against me is uh indication that uh free speech is absolutely at risk well they voted
[1:19:31.520 --> 1:19:35.040]  for it there's one story i didn't get into this was inside baseball and i agreed to not make it
[1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:39.280]  public as they dropped it we've actually had the feds the lawyers so they never seen anything like
[1:19:39.280 --> 1:19:42.000]  it i got the top one in the country they said we've never seen anything like this
[1:19:43.040 --> 1:19:48.400]  with with the complaint that the feds brought against us through the eoc i mean it was just
[1:19:48.400 --> 1:19:53.200]  on it was a total joke and i told him go ahead do your criminal deal let's go but i mean that's

[1:24:24.080 --> 1:24:29.760]  40s and 50s and just have the different denominations come out and just tell the churches hey go ahead
[1:24:29.760 --> 1:24:35.120]  and file as a charity then you get your tax exemption it's just a form well churches were tax exempt
[1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:40.880]  before that because congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting
[1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:45.680]  the free exercise thereof and then it goes on to the freedom of the press and the freedom of
[1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:50.160]  a symbol or petition the government for redesign grievances they're calling for roger stone to be
[1:24:50.160 --> 1:24:54.720]  arrested sanies and demonstrator they steal the nomination from trump all over the news washington
[1:24:54.720 --> 1:25:01.520]  post cnn msnbc they're telling churches oh you can't say you're against abortion that's political
[1:25:01.520 --> 1:25:06.080]  now when the government has no jurisdiction separation church and state means the government
[1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:10.560]  isn't involved in religion not that the government runs religion and now they're the filmmakers
[1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:16.720]  now they say your votes don't count joel gilbert's our guest documentary filmmaker
[1:25:18.080 --> 1:25:24.960]  and they voted to to to basically move forward to find him or then indict him he said no but
[1:25:24.960 --> 1:25:28.480]  they didn't have enough votes the republicans voted against it and i'll say this i've never
[1:25:28.480 --> 1:25:33.040]  seen republicans try to arrest people for their political speech maybe in the 50s and 60s for
[1:25:33.040 --> 1:25:38.640]  you know hardcore porn or whatever but man i tell you these people ought to be ashamed of themselves
[1:25:38.640 --> 1:25:44.480]  joel gilbert even when i was going to university they were bad mouth in america the second amendment
[1:25:44.480 --> 1:25:49.200]  the family that was definitely an anti-white agenda by mainly white professors but i never
[1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:53.440]  heard him say let's start arresting people for their speech you see these social justice warriors
[1:25:53.440 --> 1:25:58.160]  in the videos of where they physically attack people at these conferences and black lives matter
[1:25:58.160 --> 1:26:03.440]  is in the dormitories and in the and in the reading rooms not letting uh you know whites in it's
[1:26:03.440 --> 1:26:11.440]  also racist it's so sick what happened to the left well a couple things first of all the history
[1:26:11.440 --> 1:26:16.800]  of the left the history of socialism and communism is nothing but a disaster on every level economically
[1:26:17.360 --> 1:26:22.560]  physically you can go to every single country where they tried socialism and we have millions
[1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:27.680]  of people murdered thrown into gulags they need a secret police to force people to work because
[1:26:27.680 --> 1:26:33.200]  no one will work under socialism because even if you work there's nothing to buy your money
[1:26:33.200 --> 1:26:38.400]  doesn't get to to stay with you it goes to someone else so the disaster that is progressivism and
[1:26:38.400 --> 1:26:43.440]  socialism that's played out over the 20th century and played out in america's biggest cities in my
[1:26:43.440 --> 1:26:49.280]  film there's no place like utopia i went to detroit urban cities like in newark and south side
[1:26:49.280 --> 1:26:56.880]  chicago and you have a drug culture of single mothers unemployment through the roof crime and
[1:26:56.880 --> 1:27:03.440]  violence so the the entire progressive agenda has proven to be a disastrous failure economically
[1:27:03.440 --> 1:27:09.040]  and biologically you cannot physically survive socialism uh therefore the only way they can
[1:27:09.040 --> 1:27:14.640]  continue their agenda is not to argue back and forth the merits of socialism and communism like
[1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:20.640]  bernie sanders somehow tries to do because he hasn't gotten a memo but uh the only way they can
[1:27:20.640 --> 1:27:26.480]  possibly succeed is to prevent free speech of the people they're telling the truth telling the
[1:27:26.480 --> 1:27:32.160]  truth about barack obama's background that he is a red diaper baby his father is not the canyon
[1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:38.080]  goat herder his father is an american communist and soviet agent tell the truth about their
[1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:46.240]  policies that they're meant to keep them in power and create a new class of uh bourgeois that control
[1:27:46.240 --> 1:27:52.080]  the government the tools of state who are now using the tools of state to suppress all opposition
[1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:56.080]  so because they can't handle the truth and they can't they cannot let people hear the truth because
[1:27:56.080 --> 1:28:01.360]  they know that they would fail so the entire movement of occupy wall street black lives matter
[1:28:02.480 --> 1:28:08.560]  you know protesting silencing people it's only because their agenda their policies are so bankrupt
[1:28:08.560 --> 1:28:14.000]  and so destructive they can only be successful by silencing the opposition and that's what they
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:18.960]  tried to do to me on the fec luckily they failed again it's three three i'm not really excited
[1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:23.760]  that i i want a victory it should have been six to nothing but the three to three is an alarm bell
[1:28:23.760 --> 1:28:29.360]  bell that uh liberal fascism is creeping up in america in the land of the free in the home of
[1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:34.640]  the brave it may soon be uh the land of the liberal fascist and the silent conservatives
[1:28:35.440 --> 1:28:41.360]  sure i mean i don't think it's creeping i think it's galloping now well it's it's the the momentum
[1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:45.840]  is really really scary i mean dinesh this is another filmmaker whom i respect uh
[1:28:46.480 --> 1:28:51.760]  he i guess did an election in propriety that he admitted to but he was clearly overcharged
[1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:56.320]  nine months in prison uh five years of probation can't travel out of the hill where he can take
[1:28:56.320 --> 1:29:00.800]  money from third world dictators or foundation for election stuff and to send missiles to al-qaeda
[1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:04.560]  but this guy gave money to his friend to run for senate you know with thirty thousand dollars
[1:29:04.560 --> 1:29:10.960]  whatever but expanding on that what about the the texas attorney general for two years had
[1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:16.560]  and traded commodities was at dinner with people one of them probably a mole and they go what's a
[1:29:16.560 --> 1:29:21.440]  good investment he says oh this company i used to be at and so they've indicted him i mean
[1:29:21.440 --> 1:29:27.520]  because he was suing obama yeah well look you only had to see obama go to cuba to see to hang out
[1:29:27.520 --> 1:29:32.800]  with the castro brothers and play pals with uh rollo castro stand in front of political
[1:29:32.800 --> 1:29:37.600]  dissidents arrested while he was there on tv and our media celebrated they're like stay there joel
[1:29:37.600 --> 1:29:41.120]  gilbert i'm gonna play a bunch of clips when we come back since you mentioned in bernie sanders
[1:29:41.120 --> 1:29:45.280]  why something what it's like to be poor obama communisms you know not much different than
[1:29:45.280 --> 1:29:50.720]  then capitalism and drudges warning all straight ahead i'm alex jones info wars dot com we're on
[1:29:50.720 --> 1:29:56.960]  the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:30:01.040 --> 1:30:04.960]  well it's official the glp establishment has canceled the colorado caucus because they don't
[1:30:04.960 --> 1:30:09.520]  want trump to win a free election that's right the party later transforming our representational
[1:30:09.520 --> 1:30:13.840]  republic into an unelected autocracy in plain view they're not even rigging the election behind the
[1:30:13.840 --> 1:30:18.480]  scenes they're openly canceling it outright it's almost too sensational to even put into words
[1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:22.720]  the glp establishment is killing the right to vote perhaps the most sacred right held by millions
[1:30:22.720 --> 1:30:26.640]  of americans it's not even an exaggeration compared to this the communist china they're
[1:30:26.640 --> 1:30:30.800]  unelected communist party officials appoint unelected leaders to rule the country without the
[1:30:30.800 --> 1:30:35.440]  consent of the people and that's exactly what just happened to colorado state glp leaders appointed
[1:30:35.440 --> 1:30:39.600]  ted cruz as their presidential candidate without the consent of the people this underscores something

[1:39:26.640 --> 1:39:32.400]  dealing with and what we're dealing with uh barack obama for example skipping forward a little bit
[1:39:33.440 --> 1:39:38.800]  he sat in reverend rite's church uh because reverend rite was a very comfortable person
[1:39:38.800 --> 1:39:43.120]  for him obama's real father frank marshall davis says you know i showed in my film
[1:39:43.120 --> 1:39:50.720]  um there he is right there uh frank marshall davis raised obama and radicalized him in his youth
[1:39:50.720 --> 1:39:58.800]  to an anti-white anti-american ideology pro-cuban pro-russian ideology frank marshall davis dies
[1:39:58.800 --> 1:40:04.480]  in 86 and obama shows up in reverend rite's church reverend rite's literally the same guy it's his
[1:40:04.480 --> 1:40:09.280]  substitute father figure and he says the same things as frank marshall davis uh america's a
[1:40:09.280 --> 1:40:17.120]  racist country america abroad is causing harm to people on and on and barack obama assured us that
[1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:22.720]  he never really listened to those uh speeches and he didn't agree with this ideology uh he ran for
[1:40:22.720 --> 1:40:27.920]  president as a mainstream candidate i'm gonna cut the deficit in half i'm gonna support israel
[1:40:27.920 --> 1:40:33.680]  obama cares not attacks and just like in the wizard of us uh everything obama said he never
[1:40:33.680 --> 1:40:40.880]  intended to do they were just empty promises to trick people into using them to take power and
[1:40:40.880 --> 1:40:46.080]  that's the ideology of the far left is to use groups and pit them against each other and then use
[1:40:46.080 --> 1:40:52.080]  their discontent to take power not to help people but to take power and then the playbook says once
[1:40:52.080 --> 1:40:58.240]  you take power throw the voters under the bus pursue an agenda that nobody voted for and impose
[1:40:58.240 --> 1:41:04.400]  your far left agenda on on the country and use the tools of state to keep a permanent hold on power
[1:41:04.400 --> 1:41:09.680]  like the supreme court like the fec and arrest your political opponents they always do the same thing
[1:41:10.800 --> 1:41:16.080]  same thing this is their playbook so we've seen it many many times and that with the full backing
[1:41:16.080 --> 1:41:22.160]  of the media uh we're seeing our liberties and constitutional rights being eroded and literally
[1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:26.480]  the number one right we have is freedom of speech if we don't have freedom of speech we're no longer
[1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:32.080]  a constitutional republic and we i think these uh last few months before the november election
[1:41:32.080 --> 1:41:37.120]  if we don't elect a conservative uh in the white house to write the ship and write the
[1:41:37.120 --> 1:41:44.880]  constitutional uh balance uh i think uh liberal fascism will become the norm and uh the ability
[1:41:44.880 --> 1:41:50.320]  to express ourselves on radio on drudge links and uh movies we're gonna have to be very careful
[1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:55.600]  what we say because if they don't have a law already to persecute us they'll make one up
[1:41:55.600 --> 1:42:00.400]  and this is their methodology because their policies are bankrupt the economic policies
[1:42:00.400 --> 1:42:09.840]  are bankrupt they're a racist group that uses people to take power uh so i've been very concerned
[1:42:09.840 --> 1:42:14.160]  about this i think america is in grave danger that's why i made these films to share this message
[1:42:14.160 --> 1:42:18.960]  that's why i listen to your show uh because we do have to stay in it together and try to spread
[1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:26.640]  the word and educate people and hopefully uh we can prevail keep going i mean break down more of
[1:42:26.640 --> 1:42:31.440]  what you think we can do well what can we do uh look it's been a very tough struggle when you have
[1:42:31.440 --> 1:42:38.560]  the tools of state the irs the uh the power of the federal election commission the supreme court
[1:42:38.560 --> 1:42:43.600]  one vote away from saying the second amendment only applies to a militia and not an individual
[1:42:43.600 --> 1:42:49.120]  and they take away our right to self defense oh lo and behold the uh any kind of criminals or
[1:42:49.680 --> 1:42:55.040]  foreign governments uh have arms but we're now we're unarmed so the attack has been on the
[1:42:55.040 --> 1:43:00.000]  constitution all this time it was really way back to the fifties that the radical leftist supported
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:05.200]  by the soviet union common turn obama's father was a soviet agent he was hauled before the
[1:43:05.920 --> 1:43:12.800]  uh house committee on uh communist activities denied refused to testify when they asked him
[1:43:12.800 --> 1:43:17.040]  if he's a member of the communist party but they realized that america could not be defeated
[1:43:17.040 --> 1:43:22.640]  militarily from the outside so from the get go for the past sixty seven years the the job
[1:43:22.640 --> 1:43:27.600]  they took upon themselves was to defeat america from the inside erode our institutions attack the
[1:43:27.600 --> 1:43:32.880]  constitution that's why i say that obama's election was not a sudden political phenomenon
[1:43:32.880 --> 1:43:38.080]  it was a result of this american socialist movement that creeped into our our media
[1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:44.560]  entertainment journalism universities on every level for years and years and barack obama's
[1:43:44.560 --> 1:43:50.000]  election was a result of that and that's what enabled him to simply lie about who he was and
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:54.800]  what his agenda was and no one even questioned it except for very few people the people that
[1:43:54.800 --> 1:43:59.920]  questioned it were ignored i mean i had an expose with a mountain of evidence that obama's real
[1:43:59.920 --> 1:44:06.400]  father was a soviet agent uh i went to hawaii twice to look into obama's background that's
[1:44:06.400 --> 1:44:12.240]  twice as many times as all the media combined to even question who this guy says he is by the way
[1:44:12.240 --> 1:44:16.240]  my mother heard g1 like three four years ago when you were first on her five whatever it was when
[1:44:16.240 --> 1:44:21.920]  dreams my real father came out it was over the top she didn't believe it she saw the film and was
[1:44:21.920 --> 1:44:26.400]  shaken and said it's open and shut it is his father and he admits he lived with him on the
[1:44:26.400 --> 1:44:31.280]  summers and was his grandfather's best friend and looks just like him in the photos of obama's
[1:44:31.280 --> 1:44:37.040]  mother with him in the porn shoots and obama's sitting on the same couch as the porn photos i
[1:44:37.040 --> 1:44:42.560]  mean it's open and shut yeah obama he never actually hid it in his book dreams for my father i'm
[1:44:42.560 --> 1:44:47.840]  going to quote you from his own book he says when i when i was nine years old and grand took me to
[1:44:47.840 --> 1:44:53.200]  frank's house it was as though they had an unwritten contract between them that i could not
[1:44:53.200 --> 1:44:59.440]  understand and then when the kenyan obama died obama writes i did not have any documentation to
[1:44:59.440 --> 1:45:04.640]  prove he was my real father so he's dropping hints all the time and he's worshiping frank
[1:45:04.640 --> 1:45:10.640]  throughout the entire book now when he runs for president 2005 he releases an audio version of
[1:45:10.640 --> 1:45:15.920]  dreams from my father where he's the narrator and lo and behold frank is scrubbed from the book
[1:45:16.800 --> 1:45:23.680]  so i detail how obama tried to hide the connection to frank marshall davis because it reveals a
[1:45:23.680 --> 1:45:30.400]  radical agenda and he surrounded himself with radicals david axelrod both parents communist
[1:45:30.400 --> 1:45:36.160]  party members valerie jared her father worked with frank marshall davis on a communist newspaper in
[1:45:36.160 --> 1:45:42.560]  chicago so we have real closet red diaper babies running this country and ramming this agenda of
[1:45:42.560 --> 1:45:49.280]  regulations manipulating the law ignoring the law down our throats and we're at a very critical time
[1:45:49.280 --> 1:45:54.240]  where liberty i believe hangs in the balance and we hope that this can be turned around
[1:45:54.960 --> 1:45:59.920]  all we can do is continue alexa do what we do is try to educate people and spread the message to
[1:45:59.920 --> 1:46:05.120]  really look at this because like your mom in 2012 people looked at me like i was crazy how could
[1:46:05.120 --> 1:46:10.480]  you question obama he said his father was from kenya he said he was a mainstream guy he said he
[1:46:10.480 --> 1:46:15.600]  wanted to help people well that's the new radicals they used to look you in the eye in the 60s and
[1:46:15.600 --> 1:46:20.480]  say we're going to destroy you we're going to replace the constitution we hate america
[1:46:21.520 --> 1:46:27.840]  bill ares taught obama look people in the eye and hide your agenda tell them you want to help them
[1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:33.280]  and then use them to take power and that's the lesson the 60s radicals brought to chicago and
[1:46:33.280 --> 1:46:38.880]  taught obama and the new generation of radicals and that's the thing is i mean uh from larry
[1:46:38.880 --> 1:46:42.480]  graphwald some of the other heroes who were in the meetings that came out in court they constantly
[1:46:42.480 --> 1:46:46.640]  we just sit around how about reeducation camps how they're going to kill 25 million of us but 50
[1:46:46.640 --> 1:46:52.000]  million in slave camps and they do this everywhere they go it's like it's just an evil psycho group
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:56.560]  that calls themselves communists for the people and then everybody wonders why communism always
[1:46:56.560 --> 1:47:01.360]  goes so bad because you go back to the jackabins which were the proto-communist the french revolution
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:06.960]  that's what they wanted was to overthrow reality they're basically satanist now these guys worshiped
[1:47:06.960 --> 1:47:13.680]  mal mal was their hero they rave rave the the red book around mal murdered 60 million of i'm sorry
[1:47:13.680 --> 1:47:18.880]  50 million of his own people and collective farms don't forget they used to worship fidel castrol
[1:47:18.880 --> 1:47:23.280]  bernie standards big castrol fan you went to the soviet let me bring this up to you real quick
[1:47:23.280 --> 1:47:28.080]  no i mean he goes to cuba he stands in front of shea guavara they're arresting people on tv
[1:47:28.640 --> 1:47:33.760]  in front of everyone and and the media is like isn't this great for saying liberta liberta down
[1:47:33.760 --> 1:47:37.760]  with the castro dictatorship they're dragging him away to be beaten up in cars driven off
[1:47:38.880 --> 1:47:43.040]  and then i remember reading actually went like 20 years ago the library actually get a copy of
[1:47:43.040 --> 1:47:47.840]  shea guavara it's one of his books i wanted to show people on here where he said black people
[1:47:47.840 --> 1:47:52.400]  weren't humans and the natives were dumb stupid you know idiots and roaches and all this stuff
[1:47:52.400 --> 1:47:57.520]  why would frank marshall davis a black guy love a guy because i know he did shea guavara that said
[1:47:57.520 --> 1:48:02.640]  blacks weren't humans whoa whoa and of course you know when obama was in latin america uh you
[1:48:02.640 --> 1:48:09.440]  know they call him the dumb black man uh i mean what is going on here the the psychology of the
[1:48:09.440 --> 1:48:18.080]  left is a twisted sick fantasy it's a destructive fantasy that seeks utopia on earth and the theory
[1:48:18.080 --> 1:48:22.400]  that they have is different from conservatives we look at america and we look at the world and we
[1:48:22.400 --> 1:48:27.120]  say okay america is the greatest place in the world is the greatest country it's ever been it's not
[1:48:27.120 --> 1:48:34.880]  perfect but we love america radicals communist socialists they look at america as do any communists
[1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:42.000]  and they say well america doesn't hold up to utopia it's not as good as utopia so our goal
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:46.640]  is to we're gonna have to destroy it we're gonna have to ruin it break it down i want to kill gays
[1:48:46.640 --> 1:48:51.360]  to wipe it out he's so liberal i'm sorry well okay we're gonna destroy america and then we'll
[1:48:51.360 --> 1:48:56.000]  rebuild a socialist utopia on earth a fantasy and that's why in all these communist countries they
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:01.520]  had to send people to reeducation centers to the gulags because they didn't agree to be reeducated
[1:49:01.520 --> 1:49:06.880]  they didn't buy into the utopian fantasy so these people have what i call a destructive passion
[1:49:06.880 --> 1:49:12.960]  it's a passion for destroying things so obama goes to cuba and instead of saying hey all the cars
[1:49:12.960 --> 1:49:20.320]  here from the 1950s because time stood still when socialism took over people are in poverty and he
[1:49:20.320 --> 1:49:26.640]  says hey but they have some good education and a few good doctors here so maybe we should uh applaud
[1:49:26.640 --> 1:49:30.240]  cuba and thank them for what they've done i'm always hearing how great healthcare is in england
[1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:35.040]  but they all run here to get it let's play this clip of obama in argentina lying to people about
[1:49:35.040 --> 1:49:42.560]  communism here it is you know so often uh in the past there's been a sharp division between left
[1:49:42.560 --> 1:49:50.560]  and right between capitalist and communist or socialist and especially in the americas that's
[1:49:50.560 --> 1:50:01.040]  been a big debate right ah you know you're you're a capitalist yankee dog and oh you know you're some
[1:50:01.040 --> 1:50:06.160]  you know crazy communists you know that's gonna take away everybody's property
[1:50:06.160 --> 1:50:15.120]  and i mean those are in interesting intellectual arguments but i think for your generation you
[1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:21.520]  should be practical and just choose from what works you don't have to worry about
[1:50:22.240 --> 1:50:28.160]  whether it neatly fits into socialist theory or capitalist theory you just decide what works
[1:50:29.840 --> 1:50:34.320]  yeah i'll help them i'll help them out here i'll help them out here alex uh nothing works
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:41.280]  in socialism nothing works in communism it's a complete disaster it doesn't fit the character
[1:50:41.280 --> 1:50:47.360]  of humanity but it does work for the people on top of parasites it works for them to control people
[1:50:47.360 --> 1:50:53.920]  and use people to maintain power but as an economic system and a social system it's a
[1:50:53.920 --> 1:50:59.680]  complete disaster it is slavery renamed as communism for chumps we'll be back with joel

[1:54:34.640 --> 1:54:41.840]  that most countries have gone into bondage most countries have gone through mass extermination
[1:54:43.600 --> 1:54:46.880]  because they get evil groups in charge they just want to take over and dominate that don't
[1:54:46.880 --> 1:54:53.840]  want prosperity the renaissance and the west has all been about prosperity china was generally about
[1:54:53.840 --> 1:54:58.960]  prosperity but got invaded by the mongols and other folks and had problems but then they got
[1:54:58.960 --> 1:55:04.160]  overpopulated had issues and then the communists took over and it's just been hellish but they
[1:55:04.160 --> 1:55:09.200]  use that very entrepreneurial smart people to now be the engine under all these generals that own
[1:55:09.200 --> 1:55:14.240]  the factories and their billionaires their their kids are billionaires and they just live like kings
[1:55:14.240 --> 1:55:18.480]  i mean there's very rich fancy areas of austin i go to sometimes for business meetings and
[1:55:18.480 --> 1:55:23.840]  there are communist party officials in there some of them i've seen on tv and it's like stunning
[1:55:23.840 --> 1:55:28.320]  and they're just there at the fancy malls buying you know their wives five thousand dollar purses
[1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:33.760]  and it's just and they're all moving and taking their money out i mean it is scary to know
[1:55:34.560 --> 1:55:41.040]  that it it's not communism gonna rise it's communism's plan and then you get somebody like
[1:55:41.040 --> 1:55:46.480]  bernie saners didn't have a job till he was 40 is a communist folks he was part of the the student
[1:55:46.480 --> 1:55:52.320]  groups that were communist and here he is up there talking about a lot of real problems we have but
[1:55:52.320 --> 1:55:57.200]  giving false solutions and then race baiting saying whites don't know what it's like to be poor
[1:55:58.320 --> 1:56:02.880]  what about the 10 million ukrainians estimated over 50 years that were killed by the russians
[1:56:03.520 --> 1:56:07.040]  some estimates are higher some lower what about the tens of millions of russians killed or the
[1:56:07.040 --> 1:56:13.440]  polls killed or what about what the nazis killed i mean poor whites double the number of blacks who
[1:56:13.440 --> 1:56:19.360]  were poor in this country and statistics show in sociology a lot of whites are too prideful
[1:56:19.360 --> 1:56:24.400]  to go on the dole and so it's much higher it's a very dangerous situation and very hateful
[1:56:25.600 --> 1:56:29.760]  you know joe i watch tv now and obama coming out saying hey i'm sorry i'm appointing a white guy
[1:56:29.760 --> 1:56:33.360]  the supreme court or whatever and it's all the bashing everywhere it's it's the new
[1:56:33.360 --> 1:56:40.640]  new cause celeb the new fad is to just demonize white people uh what's going on with that and
[1:56:40.640 --> 1:56:47.440]  other key points well uh obama learned the anti-white agenda from his father frank marshall davis it
[1:56:47.440 --> 1:56:54.080]  was reinforced by reverend jeremiah right an anti-white agenda uh the weather underground
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:56:58.480]  they were allied with the black panthers his other mentor bill eras again anti-white
[1:56:58.480 --> 1:57:03.600]  uh they believe that white people are the root of all evil in the world and must be
[1:57:04.400 --> 1:57:11.520]  contained stopped uh reeducated this is their twisted ideology all of these people are sociopaths
[1:57:11.520 --> 1:57:16.880]  including uh bernie sanders who you mentioned uh it's just shocking today that he's winning
[1:57:17.600 --> 1:57:23.840]  primaries when this guy is an open communist was a communist all his life and he espouses nothing
[1:57:23.840 --> 1:57:29.840]  but a conspiracy theory there are evil strawmen billionaires who are preventing you from earning
[1:57:29.840 --> 1:57:36.880]  a living and the uh they're buying elections by giving money to super PACs well jeb bush's
[1:57:36.880 --> 1:57:43.520]  super PACs didn't help them and uh donald trump uh is winning the election through the media he
[1:57:43.520 --> 1:57:50.640]  doesn't need any super PACs so his entire campaign is a conspiracy theory as is communism uh so it's
[1:57:50.640 --> 1:57:56.480]  just shocking and we're really in a in bad shape if everybody simply claps for bernie sanders and
[1:57:56.480 --> 1:58:01.520]  votes for him hillary clenn is not that far off from his policies he just doesn't admit sure but if
[1:58:01.520 --> 1:58:09.040]  you google uh soviet atrocities chinese communist atrocities there's thousands of pages just an
[1:58:09.040 --> 1:58:14.640]  image of the machine gunning little kids and and killing people at sports stadiums and mobile
[1:58:14.640 --> 1:58:19.920]  execution vans and killing buddhist for nothing and the leftist goes good kill buddhist it's so
[1:58:19.920 --> 1:58:25.680]  liberal i mean it's just freakazoid yeah these people the reason the the left and communists
[1:58:25.680 --> 1:58:30.640]  have to kill people because they don't agree to fit into the utopian world where everyone looks and acts

[2:00:08.240 --> 2:00:14.880]  a war on for your mind just go to the nsa interface that works closely with obama
[2:00:14.880 --> 2:00:18.000]  reportedly last week new york times admits that google takes their orders from obama
[2:00:19.280 --> 2:00:25.680]  and you can just type in chinese communist executions thousands of pages of them machine
[2:00:25.680 --> 2:00:30.800]  gunning men women and children you can see them executing children as young as 11 at sport stadiums
[2:00:32.880 --> 2:00:37.360]  and this is the type of stuff they're into they don't just kill the adults they'll kill your family
[2:00:38.480 --> 2:00:41.680]  and every psychopath you can imagine is eternally they have youth brigades
[2:00:42.240 --> 2:00:46.400]  at the colleges that then take people that don't agree tie up to a tree and beat your
[2:00:46.400 --> 2:00:52.160]  brains out with a chair we were just showing some of that and this is what they don't want you to see
[2:00:52.160 --> 2:00:55.760]  they show you all this fake violence on tv and everything else but they don't want you to see
[2:00:55.760 --> 2:01:01.120]  this and notice our media doesn't criticize china doesn't criticize cuba or venezuela that's like
[2:01:01.120 --> 2:01:06.400]  arresting political opposition because this is what they want to do and they've done it everywhere
[2:01:06.400 --> 2:01:11.600]  they're in control joel gilbert i mean these people are a menace yeah this is all about uh
[2:01:11.600 --> 2:01:17.520]  murdering people is a form of reeducation in other words if these people can't be reeducated
[2:01:17.520 --> 2:01:22.640]  then they have to be eliminated that's been the communist socialist uh monitor from the very
[2:01:22.640 --> 2:01:28.160]  beginning uh silencing people on universities not letting people talk in universities have a different
[2:01:28.160 --> 2:01:33.840]  opposing point of view that's to prevent people from being educated how didn't we have mobile
[2:01:33.840 --> 2:01:40.400]  execution vans in every city and no trial isn't that liberal it it always ends up there it always
[2:01:40.400 --> 2:01:45.600]  ends up there that's where socialism and communism go it's eliminating people that don't agree to fit
[2:01:45.600 --> 2:01:51.840]  into the utopian ideal of this perfect world of this paradise on earth uh that's why you have you
[2:01:51.840 --> 2:01:59.680]  had gulags that's why you have killing squads on the on one end of it we have silencing people from
[2:01:59.680 --> 2:02:06.800]  educating people we have the nesta susa being silenced the fec almost silenced me so that's a
[2:02:06.800 --> 2:02:12.480]  form of preventing information from from letting people know that there's a different world than
[2:02:12.480 --> 2:02:20.000]  this utopian fantasy that is pursued by these leftist utopians and their idea is everyone
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:26.640]  has to think and act the same dress the same make the same income poverty and agree to their
[2:02:26.640 --> 2:02:32.160]  utopian paradise on earth if you don't fit into that model you'll eventually have to be eliminated
[2:02:32.160 --> 2:02:35.520]  if you can't be reeducated now they merge it with the fec environmental movement where obama
[2:02:35.520 --> 2:02:39.840]  tells africans you can't have cars or air conditioning but he's on a jumbo jet it's one
[2:02:39.840 --> 2:02:46.240]  thing after another whether it's climate change uh campaign finance reform every single program has
[2:02:46.240 --> 2:02:52.160]  an ulterior motive obama care they don't give a damn about people's health care they're just
[2:02:52.160 --> 2:02:56.160]  interested in controlling and that push racial division as you pointed out against as we mentioned
[2:02:56.160 --> 2:03:03.520]  and here's bernie sanders when you're white you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto
[2:03:03.520 --> 2:03:08.800]  you don't know what it's like to be poor you don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk
[2:03:08.800 --> 2:03:14.640]  down the street or you get dragged out of a car and i believe that you know you know what's funny
[2:03:14.640 --> 2:03:18.080]  that's enough you know when i grew up in dallas i had a lot of black friends i played football with
[2:03:18.080 --> 2:03:22.960]  that stuff in baseball but they also maybe a third of the black folks were super racist beyond the
[2:03:22.960 --> 2:03:27.120]  clan and i'm gonna go and they started a lot of fights with me you know hey i'm gonna kick your
[2:03:27.120 --> 2:03:31.600]  what white boy i was being racially attacked and i don't know how it is to be poor i've had family
[2:03:31.600 --> 2:03:35.600]  that's been poor whites have doubled the number of blacks that are poor i mean what a hateful
[2:03:35.600 --> 2:03:44.720]  evil statement by him yeah the reason uh he's so uh sociopathic is because he's red his his uh he
[2:03:44.720 --> 2:03:49.520]  has a red view of the world this utopian society would love to put us in reeducation camps yeah
[2:03:49.520 --> 2:03:54.640]  yeah i mean the whole thing about using racism i mean look racism everybody knows is stupid uh
[2:03:54.640 --> 2:03:59.920]  there's uh always been some form of racism in the black community there's racism between different
[2:03:59.920 --> 2:04:05.520]  shades of black in uh you know asian whatever everybody knows by now that it's just a really
[2:04:05.520 --> 2:04:11.120]  dumb thing and uh it's a thing of the past and they projected on us that never are racist
[2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:14.880]  like they're saying roger stone needs to be arrested for debt for his calling for violence he
[2:04:14.880 --> 2:04:19.760]  didn't do that yeah this is uh don't forget reverend right listen to those speeches this is
[2:04:19.760 --> 2:04:27.040]  obama's policy america is racist institutionally racist we have to be fixed the way you fix us
[2:04:27.040 --> 2:04:32.480]  is take away our health care take away our ability to make income and then don't let out to us

[2:05:05.520 --> 2:05:10.560]  the border patrol to release illegal still soaking wet from the real grand brandon judd president of
[2:05:10.560 --> 2:05:15.040]  the national border patrol council told a house committee that agents were given the order soon
[2:05:15.040 --> 2:05:20.960]  after president obama decided to limit immigration enforcement in 2014 mr judd revealed that illegal
[2:05:20.960 --> 2:05:25.440]  immigrants have learned to game the system by claiming they arrived before 2014 because the
[2:05:25.440 --> 2:05:29.520]  obama administration gives lower priority to illegals who've been in the country for several
[2:05:29.520 --> 2:05:34.000]  years he said quote the illegals are still wet from the river and miles from any civilization and on
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:38.400]  their word alone we release them unless we physically saw them cross the river another news
[2:05:38.400 --> 2:05:42.880]  obama admitted he had no plans for libya after forcing goddafi out of power libya has been a
[2:05:42.880 --> 2:05:47.920]  failed state since the end of the us led coalition 2011 which created a power vacuum for isis and
[2:05:47.920 --> 2:05:51.920]  other extremist groups to exploit islamic militants have been using libya as a base of
[2:05:51.920 --> 2:05:56.880]  operations to ship weapons to syria while steadily gaining control of libya's vast oil resources

[2:10:19.440 --> 2:10:25.600]  also going to add my video from yesterday's broadcast that's already up on youtube where

[2:10:30.160 --> 2:10:34.320]  it we should admit they've canceled it and and by the way i've been saying that for about two three
[2:10:34.320 --> 2:10:40.880]  months that's that's the name i've settled on not the big steel not the the rigged election no no
[2:10:40.880 --> 2:10:44.800]  they're just canceling it and then finally the washington post got it right sort of the Denver
[2:10:44.800 --> 2:10:52.960]  post colorado republicans cancel presidential vote at 2016 caucuses then they had a uh washington
[2:10:52.960 --> 2:10:57.600]  post article getting everybody ready for it where they're like the messy way colorada is picking up
[2:10:57.600 --> 2:11:01.120]  gop delegates you know if you kill your husband or something call it messy and that's okay like
[2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:07.120]  you did a mistake may actually matter this year they've not done that before in colorado where they
[2:11:07.120 --> 2:11:11.520]  just cancel it but oh it's messy and it might matter this year it's kind of like something
[2:11:11.520 --> 2:11:17.760]  weird went on it's no big deal like oh i came over and burned your house down thought i might just
[2:11:17.760 --> 2:11:22.960]  tell you it was a little bit messy so you read these articles you see the writers trying to come
[2:11:22.960 --> 2:11:27.680]  up with a way like winston smith at the ministry of truth in 1984 trying to figure out how to
[2:11:27.680 --> 2:11:34.080]  bamboozle people so it's important story look look this is what i'm calling for everybody to do
[2:11:34.080 --> 2:11:42.240]  my own writers poll Watson to go with the angle maybe i'll write the article i write articles
[2:11:42.240 --> 2:11:48.080]  occasionally drudge usually links to them when i do but then i try to make them 14 pages long
[2:11:48.080 --> 2:11:53.600]  and make them perfect we need to put an article out explaining that you've got racketeering going on
[2:11:53.600 --> 2:12:02.080]  on that you've got voter disenfranchisement that that you've got a public false advertising
[2:12:02.080 --> 2:12:08.640]  situation where they say one person one vote one man one woman one vote and that but now we've just
[2:12:08.640 --> 2:12:14.240]  changed the rule so your vote doesn't matter when there's election laws i don't care if they've got
[2:12:14.240 --> 2:12:19.680]  a party rule claiming that they can just ignore delegates that they changed
[2:12:19.680 --> 2:12:28.640]  they're not god and even under their own rules you can't cancel a state's election period
[2:12:30.160 --> 2:12:35.840]  and so the will of people should prevail here or are they just saying there isn't voting in america
[2:12:35.840 --> 2:12:42.960]  anymore i mean can we take the clips of all the different republican officials on tv
[2:12:44.800 --> 2:12:49.520]  saying oh the media's fault your vote never counted well why do you have election laws
[2:12:49.520 --> 2:12:53.840]  why do you have voter machines why do you spend hundreds of millions in big cities on elections
[2:12:53.840 --> 2:12:59.040]  millions in small towns sometimes shitting they're holding it out i voted i voted my candidate my
[2:12:59.040 --> 2:13:03.360]  candidate oh let's watch the returns tonight who's gonna win who's gonna get the delegates well
[2:13:03.360 --> 2:13:10.800]  for the first time ever they're announcing for hillary and cruz winning in states where they
[2:13:10.800 --> 2:13:18.400]  lost ahead of time but then that's kind of unseemly so let's just cancel them the problem is writers
[2:13:18.400 --> 2:13:23.760]  and people get tied up in legalese and they don't have confidence in themselves myself included
[2:13:25.840 --> 2:13:31.440]  on analyzing something i wrote the analysis of the patriot act in 2002 it won the project
[2:13:31.440 --> 2:13:36.160]  censor award a year later it got picked up by constitutional lawyers everywhere
[2:13:37.600 --> 2:13:41.600]  and the precepts and legal points that i went and looked at just by looking at jurisprudence
[2:13:41.600 --> 2:13:47.600]  supreme court rulings and common law were then picked up by law journals and scholarly groups
[2:13:47.600 --> 2:13:54.800]  quoting me plagiarizing me by the way word for word now took me a week to write it but i mean i know
[2:13:55.440 --> 2:13:59.920]  we've got due process i know we got a fourth amendment i know they just can't circumvent
[2:13:59.920 --> 2:14:05.920]  congress and have a secret tpp ratified and then supposedly we live under it and then i go look at
[2:14:05.920 --> 2:14:11.680]  the international and national law and lo and behold i'm correct and there's nurenberg code and a
[2:14:11.680 --> 2:14:16.720]  lot of other codes that just because a president says i can send people to a death camp doesn't
[2:14:16.720 --> 2:14:24.800]  mean you can do that if you're a chancellor or a prime minister or a president i mean you know
[2:14:24.800 --> 2:14:30.080]  chelchescu said he could murder tens of thousands of people every few months but i mean he finally
[2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:38.480]  got strung up musolini i mean you can't just sit there and say it's the law we can grab buddhist
[2:14:38.480 --> 2:14:44.400]  peaceful practitioners who do yoga in the morning and take them to a medical center
[2:14:44.400 --> 2:14:47.520]  keeping for two years until somebody needs their organ and then kill them
[2:14:50.240 --> 2:14:55.760]  what just because you say it's okay because because you've got a pollot bureau and a central
[2:14:55.760 --> 2:15:00.800]  committee who've been appointing each other since she first took over a mountain area in 1927 in
[2:15:00.800 --> 2:15:07.120]  china and enslaved local villagers to grow rice for you and here we are 90 years later 85 years
[2:15:07.120 --> 2:15:12.240]  later and you're over a billion and a half people and suicide nets around apple factories and
[2:15:12.240 --> 2:15:18.080]  children's chained up that's their daycare and power poles pooping in the street rivers catching
[2:15:18.080 --> 2:15:25.840]  on fire total smog no environmental controls we can't compete with that and our own sickening
[2:15:25.840 --> 2:15:32.080]  leftist elite in the in the apple board they all wear little trendy pink shirts and stuff and had
[2:15:32.080 --> 2:15:36.800]  wear little birkin stocks when you see the apple board that's all camouflaged behind the scenes
[2:15:36.800 --> 2:15:41.600]  they are savage war leaders of death seriously i've talked to folks who have been involved and
[2:15:41.600 --> 2:15:47.440]  seen it they're just crazed behind the scenes racing to cover the best ai systems racing for
[2:15:47.440 --> 2:15:55.680]  global domination just focused 18 hours a day anti-human i mean they they can charge a dollar
[2:15:55.680 --> 2:16:00.000]  more for an iphone and people would double their living standards their fact they don't want them
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:04.960]  to do well they want the most oppressive factories with forced abortion and drugging of the crews
[2:16:04.960 --> 2:16:10.640]  and 16 hour work days till people's fingers bleed they hate you and why if they're going to commit
[2:16:10.640 --> 2:16:17.440]  to pure evil they're going to commit all the way and just enjoy it you look at the crazy looks on
[2:16:17.440 --> 2:16:20.800]  the eyes of the communist chinese when they're executing men women and children and they'll
[2:16:20.800 --> 2:16:24.640]  just have these little sick looks where they're choking a woman in handcuffs as they take her
[2:16:24.640 --> 2:16:32.320]  to a van and they're all getting off on it like kim jong un killing people with artillery shells
[2:16:32.320 --> 2:16:39.200]  in his family just a little fat weird smirking little spoiled filthy demon ruling everything
[2:16:39.200 --> 2:16:46.480]  slithering around that's who's going to rule us really shea guavaro worshipped by blacks everywhere
[2:16:46.480 --> 2:16:50.400]  i mean just his black liberals just we showed pictures of you know blacks wearing shea guavars
[2:16:50.400 --> 2:16:55.200]  shirts when he said blacks basically were like dumb children and weren't human and all the rest of it
[2:16:56.880 --> 2:17:03.120]  it's like the adl gives awards to jordan soros nazi collaborator rounded up thousands of people
[2:17:03.120 --> 2:17:09.440]  went on 60 minutes said he wasn't ashamed of it they call me a nazi because i'm the number one

[2:17:19.440 --> 2:17:23.840]  boarding half the blacks so what i get in return is a bunch of arrogance and chip on the shoulder
[2:17:23.840 --> 2:17:29.040]  hatred of me that's good fine all the black races all the mexican races all the all the white
[2:17:29.040 --> 2:17:33.680]  races all hate me all day because i know what's going on i want to transcend i want you to
[2:17:33.680 --> 2:17:39.200]  transcend and i'm ready to be destroyed in the process of me be because i am pro-human
[2:17:41.440 --> 2:17:45.920]  and i know i've got a soul and i want into the next level this is all just a big test
[2:17:47.280 --> 2:17:54.480]  are you next level what a joke it seems like you've got to be a nazi to get an adl award
[2:17:54.480 --> 2:18:01.360]  Arnold Schwarzenegger's gotten their award cold rolling stone he admired hitler and wanted to be
[2:18:01.360 --> 2:18:08.000]  a world dictator and on film they cut it out that's why he bought the rights to suppress it on pumping
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:18.480]  iron said that blacks weren't humans in the film he says i want to be a dictator i want to be

[2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:02.160]  and by the way nazis were totally set up run by british intel the whole thing i mean only
[2:19:02.160 --> 2:19:07.040]  a chump would support hitler some people hate the west so much or hate the angle american west so
[2:19:07.040 --> 2:19:12.480]  much they think that germany was like the underdog germany was set up germany was winning the industrial
[2:19:12.480 --> 2:19:18.160]  war germany even in the depression was coming out of it and absolutely had the patents the designs
[2:19:18.160 --> 2:19:24.160]  everything so they set up world war one suckle germany into suck them into world war one state
[2:19:24.160 --> 2:19:28.320]  was it was australian empire by committing assassinations then put the versace treaty on them
[2:19:28.320 --> 2:19:34.080]  to get all their patents all their money enslaved them then they set up hitler and all these other
[2:19:34.080 --> 2:19:38.720]  nationalist groups to put them in charge signed a secret treaty with them to attack france and other
[2:19:38.720 --> 2:19:46.000]  countries he let the british escape at duncurt let's have a whole thing operated and then only

[2:19:50.080 --> 2:19:55.520]  hitler got 21 million germans killed and at the end said the germans were trash and flooded the
[2:19:55.520 --> 2:20:06.960]  subways to kill them all hitler was a piece of crap hey i wrote the elevator with you but i don't

[2:24:52.800 --> 2:24:57.200]  they said that's the pollock bureau that's a dictatorship of parties
[2:25:00.400 --> 2:25:02.160]  but today they've got enough traders
[2:25:02.160 --> 2:25:16.320]  on every channel from abc to nbc to cbs to cnn to fox to msnbc
[2:25:19.120 --> 2:25:23.840]  look at donald trump and roger stone and paul manifold like they got three heads
[2:25:23.840 --> 2:25:32.640]  four heads we should forward like they're martians when they say that's unprecedented that's wrong
[2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:38.800]  and there's so many clips cnn and msnbc and everything i can't even play them all
[2:25:38.800 --> 2:25:42.160]  where they get up there and go was that illegal with roger stone and alice jones are saying
[2:25:42.960 --> 2:25:44.000]  should they be arrested
[2:25:47.840 --> 2:25:53.600]  they're in the washington post stones on tomorrow calling for his arrest we're saying we
[2:25:53.600 --> 2:25:58.960]  should go protest and let our voice be known and talk to the delegates you don't talk to a federal
[2:25:58.960 --> 2:26:04.640]  judge they're saying it's like you don't talk to a god you don't talk to these are the people that
[2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:12.480]  they they decide who's president now and again we don't even need primaries in four states the next
[2:26:12.480 --> 2:26:18.480]  four states they're just you know what i wouldn't put them past it to announce that california is
[2:26:18.480 --> 2:26:24.480]  canceled i mean bernie sanders just one Wyoming one a bunch of the states doesn't matter goes to
[2:26:24.480 --> 2:26:30.080]  hillary got it right here in my stack i'm gonna open the phones up on this and you know is everybody
[2:26:30.080 --> 2:26:37.200]  listening to me because i'm gonna call paul watching right now he's a really smart cookie and he
[2:26:37.200 --> 2:26:41.840]  listens to the show a lot but you know what i'm gonna see if he'll answer right now
[2:26:41.840 --> 2:26:48.160]  i'm gonna see he's got two different cell phone numbers i get i'm confused which is which
[2:26:50.880 --> 2:26:55.200]  you guys call paul watching right now on his landline or his homeland or skype i want to get
[2:26:55.200 --> 2:26:59.920]  him on right now this is too important i at least need to just put all this out there
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:05.760]  because paul wants to be so accurate that he'll then get a legal theorem with me and try to
[2:27:05.760 --> 2:27:13.280]  spend a week studying it you can't tell people they're not allowed to vote and also hold out
[2:27:13.280 --> 2:27:18.080]  that your vote counts and then cancel primaries or have him win the popular vote and then before
[2:27:18.080 --> 2:27:24.880]  they even get to the convention say that it belongs to ted cruise vice versa hillary getting it from
[2:27:26.240 --> 2:27:32.320]  sanders go read jim crow loss you can't put a poll tax on people you can't try to block them
[2:27:32.320 --> 2:27:38.880]  voting anyway there's laws and there's fraud and there's them advertising with false advertising
[2:27:38.880 --> 2:27:43.120]  that you vote it counts and that's going with their argument that they have a right to suspend
[2:27:43.120 --> 2:27:50.800]  a damn election and excuse my french but man come on let's bring spring up gosh you got him fast i don't
[2:27:50.800 --> 2:27:57.280]  know me get him on audio skype or video paul i don't know if you've been listening uh we got
[2:27:57.280 --> 2:28:02.640]  your twitter up there right now but they're not allowed to suspend an election outright
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:08.720]  they've changed the rules as you know they're playing a huge mind game here and i need articles out
[2:28:09.280 --> 2:28:13.680]  maybe we'll write this together today or tomorrow but we need to take my first
[2:28:13.680 --> 2:28:17.360]  hour's broadcast where i let the facts out you can go to the jim crow laws you can go to the
[2:28:17.360 --> 2:28:23.120]  federal laws that overturned it 1965's voter voting rights act and others
[2:28:23.120 --> 2:28:29.440]  i mean when they tried to stop blacks voting in primaries they sent federal troops in so
[2:28:30.320 --> 2:28:33.760]  if we go with the angle imagine you know one million blacks not allowed to vote
[2:28:34.320 --> 2:28:37.760]  or whatever the number is in colorado everybody will finally pay attention to go wait
[2:28:37.760 --> 2:28:43.440]  blacks got denied to vote and then people will kind of go oh because it see as long as everybody
[2:28:43.440 --> 2:28:48.240]  loses their rights in the communist system it's okay that no one gets to vote well wait a minute
[2:28:48.240 --> 2:28:51.920]  what about everybody else and again i'm not saying blacks are better that's what the that's
[2:28:51.920 --> 2:28:55.920]  kind of the media operates with that because only blacks can have their rights violated well
[2:28:55.920 --> 2:28:59.600]  everyone's had their rights violated so if we go with that angle and explain that again everybody
[2:28:59.600 --> 2:29:04.160]  else doing that angle and get into the legalese of it and the election fraud and the racketeering
[2:29:04.160 --> 2:29:09.760]  of a group getting together and organized crime poll and lying to everyone i'm gonna come back
[2:29:09.760 --> 2:29:15.360]  from break you're there i know you get through that fast and talk to you but i mean do you get
[2:29:15.360 --> 2:29:18.400]  what i'm saying paul we need to get this talking point out this could defeat them
[2:29:18.400 --> 2:29:26.000]  no i mean it's crazy alex i mean there's going to be a massive protest uh by colorado republicans
[2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:30.240]  at the republican party headquarters on april 15 so that looks like it's going to be huge
[2:29:30.880 --> 2:29:35.200]  but yeah i'll stay on top of it well absolutely but here's the deal they keep listening to the
[2:29:35.200 --> 2:29:40.080]  kool-aid the propaganda from the party people that they're allowed to do this paul the point is
[2:29:40.080 --> 2:29:45.920]  they're not there's election laws they have the trust in this and it's if it's a closely disputed
[2:29:45.920 --> 2:29:51.600]  deal at the party level not just cancel stuff and have the party decide that's a takeover this is a
[2:29:51.600 --> 2:29:57.360]  takeover we need a massive insane response alex jones and the gcn radio network their buffalo on us
[2:29:57.360 --> 2:30:04.400]  folks this is mind control well it's official the glp establishment has canceled the colorado caucus
[2:30:04.400 --> 2:30:07.680]  because they don't want trump to win a free election that's right the party leaders are
[2:30:07.680 --> 2:30:12.400]  transforming our representational republic into an unelected autocracy in plain view they're not
[2:30:12.400 --> 2:30:16.640]  even rigging the election behind the scenes they're openly canceling it outright it's almost too
[2:30:16.640 --> 2:30:20.560]  sensational to even put into words the glp establishment is killing the right to vote
[2:30:20.560 --> 2:30:24.960]  perhaps the most sacred right held by millions of americans it's not even an exaggeration compared
[2:30:24.960 --> 2:30:29.680]  this to communist china their unelected communist party officials appoint unelected leaders to rule
[2:30:29.680 --> 2:30:33.920]  the country without the consent of the people and that's exactly what just happened to colorado
[2:30:33.920 --> 2:30:38.000]  state glp leaders appointed ted cruises their presidential candidate without the consent of
[2:30:38.000 --> 2:30:42.400]  the people this underscores something we've been reporting at info wars dot com for a very long time

[2:33:45.360 --> 2:33:49.520]  then oh we might take some of the delegates from states that trump or sanders is one
[2:33:50.560 --> 2:33:55.600]  and then all of a sudden they come out and they say you know we'll just cancel these state

[2:34:55.520 --> 2:35:00.560]  then it was a conspiracy theory just like they had cia officer he has to tell you that what he's
[2:35:00.560 --> 2:35:07.520]  on cnn but he is in the cia buck sexton when i they played that clip last week of me criticizing
[2:35:07.520 --> 2:35:12.000]  them canceling the election and he goes first let's understand this is a conspiracy theorist
[2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:17.840]  and we don't listen to that that's a term developed in the 60s by the cia that was he classified two
[2:35:17.840 --> 2:35:23.440]  years ago when someone said kennedy was killed by the government they they'd they'd sit with
[2:35:23.440 --> 2:35:30.240]  ridicule like i don't care about your witnesses or facts i have a magic word abracadabra hocus
[2:35:30.240 --> 2:35:40.640]  pocus shazam sesame Hasan chop tooth fairy he's like look at me i have a bob's big boy haircut on
[2:35:40.640 --> 2:35:48.560]  cia watch this conspiracy theorist haha how you like that try that on for science huh all these
[2:35:48.560 --> 2:35:54.720]  little robber baron kids like buck sexton and anderson cooper of the cia of the what is it the
[2:35:54.720 --> 2:36:03.360]  aster family that's like mommy i'm in the cia now i go on tv and a lot of the american people mommy
[2:36:04.160 --> 2:36:10.640]  Vanderbilt yeah let's get that mixed up mommy i'm worth five billion dollars in tax-free and
[2:36:10.640 --> 2:36:20.720]  foreign accounts but i'm a gay guy on cnn for the cia mommy buck sexton all these people i mean
[2:36:20.720 --> 2:36:26.080]  they're just jokes they're arrested as chinese americans posi for giving signals intelligence
[2:36:26.080 --> 2:36:30.160]  to the communist chinese see he get the death penalty good he did it what about hillary with
[2:36:30.160 --> 2:36:35.200]  missile secrets uh the clinton's gave the reactors in north korea that could make a bombs and they
[2:36:35.200 --> 2:36:45.280]  have them and the missiles i mean what are you when you're a globalist up there selling tyranny
[2:36:45.280 --> 2:36:55.840]  in america on tv selling the takeover you're worse enemies in the communist chinese they're
[2:36:55.840 --> 2:37:01.040]  they're no threat compared to you you hijack the country you don't represent the country and i'm sick
[2:37:01.040 --> 2:37:06.960]  of you there would be totalitarians and they're coming for us they hate bitter clingers folks
[2:37:06.960 --> 2:37:11.600]  they hate you because you're not evil like they are let's go back to paul joseph watson thanks for
[2:37:11.600 --> 2:37:16.720]  answering skype so quickly paul you know we've done this on my new declaration of independence
[2:37:16.720 --> 2:37:22.000]  the drudge link to that went so big that a lot of states have partially picked up quite frankly
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:29.040]  i did this with my analysis of the patriot act too and quite frankly it's all there it's it's
[2:37:29.040 --> 2:37:33.840]  it's it's it's racketeering when an organized group takes control of something that's in public
[2:37:33.840 --> 2:37:39.360]  interest and claims that they're allowed to suspend something or do something that's in the public
[2:37:39.360 --> 2:37:45.920]  interest it is false advertising to spend billions of dollars on local elections around the country
[2:37:45.920 --> 2:37:53.440]  and to say it's all about the integrity of voting under the 65 voting rights act and to then suddenly
[2:37:53.440 --> 2:38:00.320]  just say oh the party decides who's the nominee that is a dictatorship of the new party that of
[2:38:00.320 --> 2:38:07.360]  the central committee that that has the pollut bureau that is a communist model so i don't say
[2:38:07.360 --> 2:38:14.800]  they're adopting it for a verbal flourish they are adopting a communist model now practiced by
[2:38:14.800 --> 2:38:20.800]  the communist chinese and practiced by north korea the only like three countries that still practice
[2:38:20.800 --> 2:38:26.960]  it and it is it is over the top my friend and so i'm just asking you because i've got more stuff
[2:38:26.960 --> 2:38:32.640]  than a one-legged man and you know what kicking contest has got to do and you're you're my other
[2:38:32.640 --> 2:38:37.600]  writers or other websites i don't care who you are don't give us credit just go point it out that
[2:38:37.600 --> 2:38:43.200]  if blacks were disenfranchised and they said you know a million blacks in colorata couldn't vote
[2:38:43.200 --> 2:38:47.760]  that'd be a big national story be the most important thing but everyone doesn't get to vote so it's
[2:38:47.760 --> 2:38:52.080]  then okay happy just just that gets people around the mind game and everything they do is about
[2:38:52.080 --> 2:38:57.120]  acting normal to trance everybody so that even people like you and donald trump who are smart
[2:38:57.680 --> 2:39:01.600]  drum kind of goes that's not fair to take that what's going on he isn't coming out hardcore
[2:39:01.600 --> 2:39:07.040]  enough he could say imagine how we fought the civil rights act so that blacks could vote and
[2:39:07.040 --> 2:39:12.480]  ought to pay a poll a poll tax and poor whites they're just saying everyone's disenfranchised
[2:39:12.480 --> 2:39:16.320]  this is election theft this is organized crime you can't just suspend an election
[2:39:16.320 --> 2:39:21.280]  they don't even that their their rule doesn't even say that and that's why his new chief of
[2:39:21.280 --> 2:39:27.680]  staff his new campaign head manifold is is coming out saying they've gone too far but he's formally
[2:39:27.680 --> 2:39:32.720]  of the party inside so he doesn't even want to kind of inside baseball him but i mean this is
[2:39:32.720 --> 2:39:38.320]  unprecedented naked stealing of the election so i just hope we make these points and expose
[2:39:38.320 --> 2:39:43.600]  how to bring them down point out the civil rights act point out the 65 voting rights act
[2:39:43.600 --> 2:39:51.920]  point out jim crow laws that the theft the canceling of major primaries brings back
[2:39:51.920 --> 2:40:01.760]  jim crow this time on everybody i mean poll this is the magnitude of this is earth shaking that
[2:40:01.760 --> 2:40:08.000]  with a straight face they're saying an inner party will appoint the people that now appoint who can
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:15.440]  be the president that is communist china poll where you've been many times that is and i'm trying to
[2:40:15.440 --> 2:40:21.280]  break the trance of you as well you're super smart myself included i saw them months ago i put out
[2:40:21.280 --> 2:40:27.440]  videos and articles saying they're canceling the election by stealing delegates now they're outright
[2:40:27.440 --> 2:40:32.240]  i have the washington post and the Denver post saying colorado republicans cancel
[2:40:32.240 --> 2:40:37.520]  presidential vote at 2016 caucuses show that screenshot for people in cognitive dissidents
[2:40:37.520 --> 2:40:42.000]  under it saying it's hiding in plain view you wonder it's like in star wars episode three
[2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:46.160]  where he's becoming emperor and they say this is how freedom dies not with booze but with
[2:40:46.160 --> 2:40:53.840]  thunderous applause the magnitude poll the magnitude the the magnitude the magnitude
[2:40:53.840 --> 2:40:57.600]  the magnitude i mean i've never not had words i just this is so over the top
[2:40:59.200 --> 2:41:04.640]  and i just need to codify this into an article and i'm telling you trump will get the info
[2:41:04.640 --> 2:41:09.360]  others will and his supporters will and 10 percent of the people we got these rallies
[2:41:09.360 --> 2:41:14.320]  are wearing info or shirts we have to get this point out this is out this could destroy them
[2:41:14.320 --> 2:41:19.520]  paul their gamble their arrogance their nakedness now what do you think about what i've just said
[2:41:21.280 --> 2:41:26.880]  well you know when they have tyranny in europe at least they have a tacit token vote in the
[2:41:26.880 --> 2:41:32.240]  first place before ignoring it you know in in the netherlands in france in ireland and all these
[2:41:32.240 --> 2:41:37.120]  other places they had a vote on the lisbon treaty they had a vote on the e you staying in the e you
[2:41:37.920 --> 2:41:43.040]  and the people voted against what the establishment wanted so the establishment just kept having
[2:41:43.040 --> 2:41:49.440]  more votes more referendum so they've gone even a step beyond that level of tyranny with what's
[2:41:49.440 --> 2:41:58.640]  happening in colorado are you not stunned by this it is stunning but i'm not surprised by it because
[2:41:58.640 --> 2:42:03.520]  previous you know for weeks and weeks the rnc chairman has been saying the party is choosing
[2:42:03.520 --> 2:42:08.320]  a nominee it's not like they hid it this is what they said they were going to do all along and
[2:42:08.320 --> 2:42:14.640]  now they're doing it so that doesn't make it any less shocking but it's not like we weren't warned
[2:42:14.640 --> 2:42:20.400]  i mean previous previous went on fox news just five six days ago and said that casick would
[2:42:20.400 --> 2:42:26.400]  probably end up being the nominee so they signaled it well in advance so it's no surprise and that's
[2:42:26.400 --> 2:42:30.720]  why casick is so arrogant are they made just a point paul ryan with no delegates i mean
[2:42:30.720 --> 2:42:35.360]  this is our transference into a polet bureau central committee model i mean paul i've studied
[2:42:35.360 --> 2:42:38.800]  these political systems i know you have as well is this not a central committee model
[2:42:40.480 --> 2:42:45.520]  well that's precisely what it is in communist china they don't even have elections they choose
[2:42:45.520 --> 2:42:51.680]  the party leaders and everyone has to express fealty to the communist party even to be a member
[2:42:51.680 --> 2:42:57.280]  of an opposing party so i mean the way it's going it's going to end up like communist china if it
[2:42:57.280 --> 2:43:04.800]  isn't already in some ways well paul we no one else is getting a narrative out but us in drudge
[2:43:04.800 --> 2:43:10.560]  and i mean trump you know is saying this isn't fair something's going on you better watch out
[2:43:10.560 --> 2:43:15.040]  republicans and then i haven't played these clips yet let's get ready to play the ones where um
[2:43:16.080 --> 2:43:19.680]  well we got a bunch of them uh which clips do we have where they're talking about
[2:43:19.680 --> 2:43:22.560]  so i've gotten mixed up here where they're talking about arresting roger stone
[2:43:26.480 --> 2:43:32.320]  so you guys go ahead and yeah yeah you're mic for whatever reason is distorted always i can't
[2:43:32.320 --> 2:43:36.240]  hear you i'm sorry say that again
[2:43:39.920 --> 2:43:44.240]  yeah there's a couple of these uh and so we're gonna play that in a moment thank you uh what do
[2:43:44.240 --> 2:43:52.320]  you make of that paul sorry what was that alex i mean what do you make of them wanting to arrest
[2:43:52.320 --> 2:43:56.720]  roger stone for coming on this show and others and saying we should go down there and find the
[2:43:56.720 --> 2:44:02.640]  delegates and talk to them well i mean there's a that bernie sanders supporters are saying that
[2:44:02.640 --> 2:44:07.600]  people should harass the super delegates so they've gone way beyond anything that roger stone
[2:44:07.600 --> 2:44:12.080]  says well i'll be honest when you start overthrowing elections and stuff i mean i'm not calling for
[2:44:12.080 --> 2:44:15.040]  the shot hurt around the world or any type of physical stuff but man they've really crossed
[2:44:15.040 --> 2:44:18.880]  the line here i mean restraint is the way to go because we're going to discredit them with this
[2:44:18.880 --> 2:44:23.360]  but man this is not a legitimate government i mean i mean did the french have a right to overthrow
[2:44:23.360 --> 2:44:29.360]  the occupied french vici government hell yes they did go ahead paul no precisely but obviously the
[2:44:29.360 --> 2:44:34.560]  cnn edited the clip they made it sound like he was calling for violence he wasn't the only people
[2:44:34.560 --> 2:44:38.880]  who are actually suggesting that violence might be the answer are people on the left on the bernie
[2:44:38.880 --> 2:44:45.600]  sanders side and they get absolutely no controversy whatsoever so again it's that media double standard
[2:44:45.600 --> 2:44:50.320]  but it's no surprise that you know they're outright threatening to arrest him now given how
[2:44:50.320 --> 2:44:55.360]  influential he's been in pointing out how they're going to run this deal and we've featured his
[2:44:55.360 --> 2:45:00.400]  articles on info wars for months now and now it's happening so it's no surprise that they're going
[2:45:00.400 --> 2:45:07.280]  after him well paul aren't you hosting the fourth hour today yeah i'm just preparing for it now
[2:45:07.280 --> 2:45:11.280]  i'm gonna let you get off of here it's thank you and for all the great work you do by the way you
[2:45:11.280 --> 2:45:15.440]  catch a lot of stuff i don't you realize how big things are when i don't realize it so i'm not
[2:45:15.440 --> 2:45:19.120]  criticizing what i'm saying let's get out of our trance here you're writing a lot of powerful
[2:45:19.120 --> 2:45:25.920]  important articles it's just that i'm saying we have to illustrate to people we had major
[2:45:25.920 --> 2:45:30.000]  revolutions in this country so black people can vote which i think is good my grandfather
[2:45:31.280 --> 2:45:35.200]  you know really was pun intended you know the black sheep of the family for a few years
[2:45:35.760 --> 2:45:40.080]  because he became a republican and you know ran for office and you know one local office and you
[2:45:40.080 --> 2:45:45.120]  know was big on uh getting rid of jim crow for black people uh not because my family was even
[2:45:45.120 --> 2:45:48.880]  racist it was just you know you were a democrat or that was the end of it and so my family's been
[2:45:48.880 --> 2:45:53.680]  heavily involved in this i mean charleston heston marched and got beat up and stuff for this
[2:45:53.680 --> 2:45:58.400]  he was an early civil rights advocate that's why i admired him and they're just they're just running
[2:45:58.400 --> 2:46:03.600]  over all of it and it's not even a big deal so if we point out well if it was wrong to not let blacks
[2:46:03.600 --> 2:46:08.960]  vote what in hades is it okay for the democrats and republicans to pull this i mean they went too
[2:46:08.960 --> 2:46:15.200]  far canceling four state caucuses not just colorado folks and there's not even news on the other
[2:46:15.200 --> 2:46:20.480]  states it's just like yeah we don't get to vote now for president if you don't get to vote for
[2:46:20.480 --> 2:46:25.040]  who you want your party who you're going to vote for you don't get to vote and they're doing it
[2:46:25.040 --> 2:46:30.560]  with hillary as well i mean folks if this doesn't make you yell and scream i don't know what is it
[2:46:30.560 --> 2:46:35.600]  it almost makes me go crazy i mean it's just to see all these crazy people calm and taking this
[2:46:35.600 --> 2:46:39.440]  is nuts paul what do we do to shake people out of their trance i mean folks are already mad but
[2:46:39.440 --> 2:46:46.000]  they're not mad enough well we need to rail against this normalcy bias that's been you know
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:49.680]  inoculated in recent weeks which is that they were gonna steal it and people just like yeah
[2:46:49.680 --> 2:46:53.840]  they're probably gonna steal it so what are we gonna do about it that's the question i mean i
[2:46:53.840 --> 2:46:58.880]  didn't expect them to just let a revolution happen without any pushback i mean it's not
[2:46:58.880 --> 2:47:03.840]  going to be like taking candy from a baby and even if you disagree with trump on some issues
[2:47:03.840 --> 2:47:08.800]  it does represent a revolution because he's completely self-funded he's not in the pocket
[2:47:08.800 --> 2:47:13.520]  of lobbyists and they don't like it why they're so terrified of him and they've sold out to take
[2:47:13.520 --> 2:47:17.600]  over the world with american industry they sold us out trump doesn't like it he's got the people
[2:47:17.600 --> 2:47:21.520]  behind him and so they're just flipping out did you believe he wants borders did you believe
[2:47:21.520 --> 2:47:25.040]  that they're bringing in radical muslims with no vetting so he says stop it till they vet him
[2:47:25.040 --> 2:47:31.040]  did you believe he says we need to have doors on submarines and not screen doors next they'll
[2:47:31.040 --> 2:47:37.200]  say that you know santa claus isn't real and it's just ridiculous paul it is just absolutely
[2:47:37.200 --> 2:47:41.360]  dumb founding let's kick some butt to all the writers everybody else are listeners
[2:47:42.720 --> 2:47:47.840]  listeners do your own youtube videos write your own articles whatever just get them out
[2:47:47.840 --> 2:47:53.040]  everybody's got to point out that we fought a revolution to get elected government from the
[2:47:53.040 --> 2:48:00.320]  crown because they wouldn't let us have real elections and now 1776 then the 40s 50s 60s
[2:48:00.320 --> 2:48:04.880]  blacks since the end of civil war being cheated and so were poor whites to not be able to vote or
[2:48:04.880 --> 2:48:10.320]  to be screwed over and those laws were nothing compared to this this is even a law i tell you
[2:48:10.320 --> 2:48:15.360]  that previous is one arrogant piece of trash and god bless you paul i appreciate you all right thanks
[2:48:15.360 --> 2:48:20.720]  elix i'm so upset i can barely talk at this point i mean this is starting to get to me
[2:48:23.520 --> 2:48:29.760]  oh gosh i look at the rnc rules committee uh curly hugelin and i look at previous and i mean
[2:48:29.760 --> 2:48:38.160]  they are just such tempering twits i mean these are bad people these are would-be dictators
[2:48:38.160 --> 2:48:43.920]  who are doing it i mean they're robbing you of your american birthright they are slitting america's
[2:48:43.920 --> 2:48:49.520]  throat like a christmas hog you ever seen a big old 400 pounder pound hog wrap chains around its legs

[2:54:48.720 --> 2:54:52.880]  government and and i thought you were halfway wrong about that and i can't believe it and i was
[2:54:52.880 --> 2:54:57.280]  like well okay whatever and the night just ran up and he's like i've watched it 60 minutes it's

[2:55:13.680 --> 2:55:26.320]  hillary saying russia and i ran are behind isis russia is the arch enemy of the wahhabist and so
[2:55:26.320 --> 2:55:32.720]  as i ran there's sheites they're the ones that came in to stop al qaeda and isis but she knows
[2:55:32.720 --> 2:55:37.200]  the average american you know doesn't know she gets through on tv and says the delegates are mine
[2:55:37.200 --> 2:55:48.000]  doesn't matter who you vote for i mean you know it's just crazy town but let's go to the clip
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:52.720]  could donald trump sure i get roger stone be charged with menacing g.o.p convention washington
[2:55:52.720 --> 2:55:58.320]  post here's red state face criminal charges for inciting violence and they play clips from my show
[2:55:58.320 --> 2:56:03.680]  and stuff on my new show on all these programs and a couple shows they act like i'm wanting
[2:56:03.680 --> 2:56:08.160]  violence for saying we should go protest you know you people really are would be dictators you just
[2:56:08.160 --> 2:56:12.480]  think you're going to take it over you people you're the people that are going to face jail time
[2:56:12.480 --> 2:56:17.120]  for trying to stop us voting and stuff i mean that's when you go to jail and you better know it
[2:56:17.120 --> 2:56:22.160]  just because you got a bob's big boy haircut and daddy got you in the cia doesn't mean you're a man
[2:56:22.160 --> 2:56:30.640]  means you're a sack of trash yeah yeah let's let's let's go to the clip here with a former
[2:56:30.640 --> 2:56:37.360]  cruise advisor rick tyler on msnbc dangerous roger stone go ahead well what concerns me is
[2:56:37.360 --> 2:56:43.440]  paul manifold of course was a business partner with roger stone and roger stone just threatened
[2:56:43.440 --> 2:56:47.680]  uh delegates attending the convention in cleveland saying that he would publicize
[2:56:48.400 --> 2:56:55.120]  delegates hotel rooms and hotel room numbers uh if they felt if the trump campaign felt like they
[2:56:55.120 --> 2:57:02.000]  they were a part of stealing delegates uh from donald trump now he'd said that after he's called on
[2:57:02.000 --> 2:57:07.920]  trump supporters to come to cleveland and somehow protest uh the process if donald trump were denied
[2:57:07.920 --> 2:57:13.280]  the nomination i think that is dangerous we are a free society in america we're not a third world
[2:57:13.280 --> 2:57:17.280]  country we don't threaten violence against delegates and i think that ryan's previous in
[2:57:17.280 --> 2:57:22.880]  the rnc should move to ban roger stone from the convention because we cannot tolerate threats
[2:57:22.880 --> 2:57:27.280]  and threats of violence uh in the process additionally donald trump should repudiate those
[2:57:27.280 --> 2:57:32.080]  events those of his remarks all right we played that video clip the video was jumping but the
[2:57:32.080 --> 2:57:37.440]  audio was clear that's the dirty trickster that had to resign off of cruises campaign remember
[2:57:37.440 --> 2:57:44.240]  for the stuff he did to ben karsten and others that's an inversion of reality yet again they
[2:57:44.240 --> 2:57:49.280]  are stealing the popular vote they're canceling primaries are just giving it to ted cruise in
[2:57:49.280 --> 2:57:55.120]  four states colorado first they're announcing first time in history and then saying trump's
[2:57:55.120 --> 2:57:59.680]  dangerous his people are dangerous roger stone's dangerous mentions my show that's when that was
[2:57:59.680 --> 2:58:06.400]  said for coming out and talking about that and saying we shouldn't let them take it and we should
[2:58:06.400 --> 2:58:12.080]  go to where these hotels are and these delegations are and talk to these people i mean the french
[2:58:12.080 --> 2:58:15.600]  resistance would have done a lot more than that by people coming in and taking over and i'm not
[2:58:15.600 --> 2:58:21.200]  saying that because we're going to expose these people as the criminals they are doing this a lot
[2:58:21.200 --> 2:58:24.320]  of these idiot delegates are just being convinced by party bosses this is what they're supposed to
[2:58:24.320 --> 2:58:31.600]  do we're there to let them know that's not the case and we'd be a third world country sir advisor

[3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:31.840]  info war i want you i want you i need you i want you to be my friend there's vince neal
[3:00:31.840 --> 3:00:40.560]  i've caught a little fisticuffs with uh his buddy tickles cage out in vegas folks if you
[3:00:40.560 --> 3:00:48.000]  didn't know that was a staged event motley crew launched their career with staged fights and
[3:00:48.640 --> 3:00:56.640]  suitcases full of porn at the uh you know border with canada you name it he wants a piece of the
[3:00:56.640 --> 3:01:05.760]  action uh ha ought to ask nicholas cage with that little stingray tattoo on his ankle means
[3:01:06.880 --> 3:01:14.720]  nobody knows what that means i do uh huh not that i even care he is a good actor though
[3:01:15.520 --> 3:01:18.960]  when he actually wants to be the intel he's mailing it in though
[3:01:18.960 --> 3:01:30.160]  man he did that movie joe and other than not getting the texas uh accent perfectly i literally
[3:01:31.200 --> 3:01:38.080]  know people that drive the exact blue Chevy truck 20 years ago and act exactly the same with the
[3:01:38.080 --> 3:01:45.440]  exact same weirdness with with people sides of their houses caved in and deer hanging up i mean
[3:01:45.440 --> 3:01:52.800]  that movie freaked me out because around our ranch they've got pine farms and stuff with the i mean
[3:01:52.800 --> 3:01:58.080]  they they made that in bass drop which is the lost pine since in central texas and the glacier
[3:01:58.080 --> 3:02:02.960]  didn't knock them down and then these texas is the same pines but it's it's actually recreated
[3:02:02.960 --> 3:02:08.240]  what's in east texas there and it is it is unbelievable i mean that that's like a documentary
[3:02:08.240 --> 3:02:18.960]  it's so good and that's it people just kill each other for fun it's exactly the same okay i am
[3:02:18.960 --> 3:02:26.080]  digressing aren't i i've got this really important clip here hillary claims charge
[3:02:27.840 --> 3:02:31.920]  that her policies led to the rise of isis beyond absurd again that's like saying
[3:02:31.920 --> 3:02:38.960]  that sylvester being a black and white cat in linitons is absurd and the 20 bird is yellow
[3:02:38.960 --> 3:02:47.840]  for the assembly sam hates rabbits it is another total inversion of reality to her
[3:02:47.840 --> 3:02:54.240]  mindless flock of misgrants here it is jeff weaver senator sanders campaign manager said
[3:02:54.240 --> 3:02:59.520]  that you your foreign policy and you support a foreign policy that helped give rise to the
[3:02:59.520 --> 3:03:06.720]  creation of isis well that is beyond absurd and you know they're saying a lot of things these days
[3:03:06.720 --> 3:03:13.840]  and i'm just going to let them say whatever they choose to say um but uh you know isis was primarily
[3:03:14.720 --> 3:03:22.080]  the result of the vacuum in syria caused by Assad first and foremost aided and abetted by
[3:03:22.080 --> 3:03:29.280]  iran and russia so i think that uh let's put responsibility where it belongs okay so the
[3:03:29.280 --> 3:03:33.040]  people that didn't do it the people who tried to stop it you should cause libya you then invaded
[3:03:33.040 --> 3:03:38.160]  from libya with the same troops into iraq and then up into syria it's all on record you're
[3:03:38.160 --> 3:03:42.320]  like the commanding general of al-qaeda and isis obama admits his biggest mistake was libya
[3:03:42.320 --> 3:03:46.480]  they wanted to be a felt state so it wasn't a mistake they're just acting like they're sorry
[3:03:46.480 --> 3:03:50.000]  for killing hundreds of thousands of people and putting al-qaeda in charge so let's go
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:54.160]  ahead and play obama saying his biggest mistake i was i guess hillary's biggest victory here it is
[3:03:56.880 --> 3:04:02.480]  we're pulling it up right now here it is uh it is um obama it's the next clip
[3:04:02.480 --> 3:04:07.120]  my worst mistake was not here it is let's go ahead and play it best day in the white house
[3:04:09.680 --> 3:04:15.200]  the day that we passed uh health care reform and we sat out on the truman balcony with all
[3:04:15.200 --> 3:04:20.960]  the staff that had worked so hard on it and i i knew what it would mean for the families that
[3:04:20.960 --> 3:04:33.200]  i've met to denf health care worst day in the white house the day we traveled up to new town uh after
[3:04:33.200 --> 3:04:44.400]  sandy hook no explanation needed there no biggest accomplishment saving the economy from a great
[3:04:44.400 --> 3:04:57.840]  depression worst mistake probably failing to plan for the day after uh what i think was the right
[3:04:57.840 --> 3:05:03.680]  thing to do in uh intervening today is monday april eleventh and here's some of the latest news
[3:05:03.680 --> 3:05:08.080]  the obama administration has ordered the border patrol to release illegals still soaking wet from
[3:05:08.080 --> 3:05:13.280]  the real grand brandon judd president of the national border patrol council told a house committee
[3:05:13.280 --> 3:05:17.600]  that agents were given the order soon after president obama decided to limit immigration
[3:05:17.600 --> 3:05:22.720]  enforcement in 2014 mr judd revealed that illegal immigrants have learned to game the system by
[3:05:22.720 --> 3:05:27.680]  claiming they arrived before 2014 because the obama administration gives lower priority to
[3:05:27.680 --> 3:05:31.760]  illegals who've been in the country for several years he said quote the illegals are still wet
[3:05:31.760 --> 3:05:35.680]  from the river and miles from any civilization and on their word alone we release them unless
[3:05:35.680 --> 3:05:40.320]  we physically saw them cross the river another news obama admitted he had no plans for libya
[3:05:40.320 --> 3:05:44.640]  after forcing qaddafi out of power libya has been a failed state since the end of the us led
[3:05:44.640 --> 3:05:49.440]  coalition in 2011 which created a power vacuum for isis and other extremist groups to exploit
[3:05:49.440 --> 3:05:53.840]  islamic militants have been using libya as a base of operations to ship weapons of syria while
[3:05:53.840 --> 3:05:58.640]  steadily gaining control of libya's vast oil resources this is kit daniel reporting for info

[3:08:07.360 --> 3:08:19.520]  all right i'm just doing a few more minutes to finish that obama clip this is pretty important
[3:08:19.520 --> 3:08:24.240]  and then throw it to paul joseph watson joining us from london england and there is paul watson
[3:08:24.240 --> 3:08:29.200]  right there on screen for tv viewers a lot of listeners hearing me talking about see this see
[3:08:29.200 --> 3:08:34.640]  that we have a big giant radio audience it's still bigger than our tv audience but i pioneered in
[3:08:34.640 --> 3:08:39.200]  the last 17 years of 21 years on air to not just have a webcam but really to have a news show
[3:08:40.240 --> 3:08:43.200]  back then i said it once a week to the radio five days a week to show people
[3:08:43.840 --> 3:08:47.840]  what i was talking about so they can actually see it for themselves it adds a whole another
[3:08:48.480 --> 3:08:52.640]  dimension to this so we're going to paul watson here in just a moment but finishing up this obama
[3:08:52.640 --> 3:08:59.200]  clip from fox news where he's walking around a library with one of the reporters and he's talking
[3:08:59.200 --> 3:09:03.440]  about he's most proud of obama care the biggest screw job ever written by foreign insurance companies
[3:09:03.440 --> 3:09:08.960]  that made a 47 increase profit the first year globally just off our backs globally their
[3:09:08.960 --> 3:09:13.600]  profits went up total screw job doubling and triple pricing was already free health care for people
[3:09:13.600 --> 3:09:18.560]  that had emergencies and charity care now that's still there but run by the government and then
[3:09:18.560 --> 3:09:23.280]  he says his greatest accomplishment was uh also stopping a great depression so he's most proud
[3:09:23.280 --> 3:09:28.800]  of obama care greatest accomplishment was stopping a depression i thought there was no big deal in 2008
[3:09:28.800 --> 3:09:34.640]  by the way we're still where we were but a whole stack of news about the global meltdown and central
[3:09:34.640 --> 3:09:39.760]  banks and uh the imf and world bank saying negative interest rates are needed and all this craziness
[3:09:41.840 --> 3:09:46.800]  but then he says libya was something you know that he's ashamed of because they didn't do something
[3:09:46.800 --> 3:09:51.520]  after they want failed states in libya and syria and egypt everywhere they're the ones overthrowing
[3:09:51.520 --> 3:09:57.280]  it they're the ones running isis and then hillary gets up there and says it's russia and iran that
[3:09:57.280 --> 3:10:06.800]  run isis russia and iran are attacking isis isis is suny iran shiai through archenemies
[3:10:07.760 --> 3:10:14.800]  salt arabia runs al qaeda and isis but hillary thinks you're dumb
[3:10:18.720 --> 3:10:25.920]  so this is insane i mean and she's just like a giggling demon just like kim jong-un
[3:10:25.920 --> 3:10:29.840]  she's a nobody but a big fat piece of trash who's willing to be evil
[3:10:33.040 --> 3:10:37.840]  and now they're suspending elections here and saying they'll appoint who runs this is the
[3:10:37.840 --> 3:10:42.400]  pull-up bureau so let's go to the club biggest accomplishment
[3:10:45.200 --> 3:10:48.640]  saving the economy from a great depression worse mistake
[3:10:48.640 --> 3:11:03.040]  i'm probably failing to plan for the day after what i think was the right thing to do in intervening
[3:11:03.040 --> 3:11:07.440]  in libya i mean what a joke
[3:11:10.560 --> 3:11:14.320]  oh they messed up in libya it's like you go to somebody's house and pour gasoline all over it
[3:11:14.320 --> 3:11:19.600]  and light it and birds are gonna goes i thought i was building another wing i messed up jeepers
[3:11:19.600 --> 3:11:26.160]  creepers failed states what they want they want a failed state here to loot us that's what globalism
[3:11:26.160 --> 3:11:30.960]  is i'm going to paul watson i know he's gonna have a loaded hour for you powerful info look at

[3:16:45.040 --> 3:16:51.200]  go ahead yeah but i mean this migrant crisis which is what i want to get into we warned from
[3:16:51.200 --> 3:16:57.520]  the very start that this would cause civil unrest social disorder now that's beginning to happen
[3:16:57.520 --> 3:17:03.920]  we had more riots in sweden last week and now a top professor in denmark which is what i want to
[3:17:03.920 --> 3:17:10.720]  get on to now says that civil war is the most likely outcome of the migrant crisis now he's
[3:17:10.720 --> 3:17:15.840]  not the first prominent voice in europe to say this we had the swiss people's party member of
[3:17:15.840 --> 3:17:21.840]  parliament roger koppel last week saying that europe is about to abolish itself because of these
[3:17:21.840 --> 3:17:28.320]  megalomaniac policies on behalf of angela merkel we had the swiss army chief andre blackman
[3:17:28.320 --> 3:17:33.280]  warning that the risk of social unrest in europe was intensifying and that everybody
[3:17:33.280 --> 3:17:39.840]  should arm themselves of course that's very hard to do when the finished government puts out psas
[3:17:39.840 --> 3:17:47.840]  telling women to use the force to repel would be rapists we've got people in sweden we've got people
[3:17:47.840 --> 3:17:54.720]  in germany being questioned by the police if they use pepper spray to defend themselves against rapists
[3:17:54.720 --> 3:18:00.400]  so we've got this pushback by the government they admitted now that after cologne after the mass
[3:18:00.400 --> 3:18:05.440]  molestation of women not only in cologne but other major cities on new year's eve there was an
[3:18:05.440 --> 3:18:11.440]  orchestrated effort to cover this up they're covering up covering it up for their own reason
[3:18:11.440 --> 3:18:18.560]  which is they don't want to legitimize critics of mass immigration because if people get the truth
[3:18:18.560 --> 3:18:24.800]  about this and it's only come out on info wars it's only come out with people's personal experiences
[3:18:24.800 --> 3:18:30.560]  because we know the media is covering it up but if they get the truth about it if this goes viral
[3:18:30.560 --> 3:18:36.480]  in the mainstream there could very well be social disorder because once people know what's actually
[3:18:36.480 --> 3:18:42.560]  happening it's insane i mean there's a crime map of just the rapes and the other crimes that have
[3:18:42.560 --> 3:18:48.400]  happened in germany over the last six months since this migrant crisis started and it's just
[3:18:48.400 --> 3:18:54.800]  replete with example after example but this isn't being shown in the mainstream media
[3:18:54.800 --> 3:19:02.160]  they're still showing refugees arriving and it's little children on boats even though you can look
[3:19:02.160 --> 3:19:09.280]  at the UN's own figures and see that it's 74% men but if all they do is show you little smiling
[3:19:09.280 --> 3:19:15.120]  children arriving on boats in the media then of course the vast majority of the population
[3:19:15.120 --> 3:19:21.440]  is going to be misled but the danish professor is warning and he's an expert on the link between
[3:19:22.000 --> 3:19:29.120]  IQ and how that affects migration policies how that affects western society he's saying that
[3:19:29.120 --> 3:19:35.760]  the effect of this mass migration crisis will be the collapse of western civilization that's not
[3:19:35.760 --> 3:19:42.080]  alex jones saying that that's not me saying that that's a top professor in denmark we're going to

[3:24:18.640 --> 3:24:23.680]  back to support our overdrive of the alex joneshow i was just getting into this article before
[3:24:23.680 --> 3:24:30.080]  the break which is up on info wars dot com professor civil war most likely outcome of migrant crisis
[3:24:30.080 --> 3:24:36.400]  this is professor helmut neiburg who writes in the danish newspaper giland poston now he's an
[3:24:36.400 --> 3:24:41.200]  expert in the connection between hormones and intelligence he was one of the guys who did the
[3:24:41.200 --> 3:24:47.840]  research the evolutionary studies which show that because people from southern climates as they
[3:24:47.840 --> 3:24:55.360]  migrated north had to deal with harsher weather with colder weather they had to scavenge for food
[3:24:55.360 --> 3:25:01.840]  they had to work harder just to survive that had the effect of making their brains grow larger and
[3:25:01.840 --> 3:25:07.680]  of course that's why we see generally speaking higher intelligence amongst people who live in
[3:25:07.680 --> 3:25:14.400]  the northern hemisphere compared to those who live in the south just a fact don't get triggered by it
[3:25:14.400 --> 3:25:21.200]  being racist it's a biological evolutionary fact and of course we know that lower IQs are linked
[3:25:21.200 --> 3:25:28.320]  with more aggression which is why you see the more migrants we allow into the western to western
[3:25:28.320 --> 3:25:35.360]  europe to north america those rape cases will increase as they're already doing off the back
[3:25:35.360 --> 3:25:42.000]  of over a million migrants entering europe over the past six months alone so he says that low IQ
[3:25:42.000 --> 3:25:47.840]  migrants arriving from non-western countries lead to a decline in the average intelligence
[3:25:47.840 --> 3:25:55.600]  of western societies therefore a drop in living standards and rising crime rates this is a quote
[3:25:55.600 --> 3:26:03.040]  in 2016 the current immigration policy gives us three alternatives submission repatriation
[3:26:03.040 --> 3:26:08.960]  or civil war unless europe starts to lead a responsible family immigration and integration
[3:26:08.960 --> 3:26:17.200]  policy started but stated by the theory of evolution i think civil war is most likely
[3:26:18.000 --> 3:26:25.360]  and he goes on to state that merely invoking the threat of right wing extremism as german
[3:26:25.360 --> 3:26:30.800]  authorities have done for anybody who dares to talk about the problems that this may bring
[3:26:30.800 --> 3:26:37.920]  now they're raiding people's apartments in germany to merely invoke right wing extremism
[3:26:37.920 --> 3:26:46.400]  isn't going to fix the massive societal breakdown the importing millions of people on a whim over
[3:26:46.400 --> 3:26:53.040]  the course of the last six months alone will have on society so again he's not alone in warning that
[3:26:53.040 --> 3:27:00.240]  this is going to lead to societal breakdown top military and police chiefs throughout europe
[3:27:00.240 --> 3:27:06.400]  have said the same thing top security experts in germany told chancellor angela merkel last
[3:27:06.400 --> 3:27:12.960]  october that the middle class was becoming radicalized that was their word radicalized
[3:27:12.960 --> 3:27:19.360]  as a result of her open borders migrant policy that's why they need to control the media that's
[3:27:19.360 --> 3:27:27.360]  why in sweden their top broadcaster has banned the use of the word immigrant that's why in germany
[3:27:27.360 --> 3:27:36.240]  their top broadcaster zdf has banned naming rape suspects by their race because according to
[3:27:36.240 --> 3:27:41.760]  police they don't want to legitimize critics of mass migration that's why one of the top
[3:27:41.760 --> 3:27:48.640]  zdf heads over there the top german broadcaster basically quit and said everything we say about
[3:27:48.640 --> 3:27:56.480]  this migrant crisis has to go through the government first this is state media they need to control
[3:27:56.480 --> 3:28:02.960]  the narrative because if the true narrative really gets out there could be massive social
[3:28:02.960 --> 3:28:09.680]  disorder that's why they covered up cologne in the very first hours and days after the attack
[3:28:09.680 --> 3:28:16.480]  wasn't even reported on this mass molestation which would normally be a huge story right at the turn
[3:28:16.480 --> 3:28:22.720]  of the year wasn't even reported on by any mainstream media outlet for days even though it was on
[3:28:22.720 --> 3:28:29.840]  social media instantly they put the clamp down so hard because again it counters their narrative
[3:28:29.840 --> 3:28:34.640]  and then it came out that most of the perpetrators most of which were moroccan
[3:28:35.600 --> 3:28:42.640]  were not actually newly arrived refugees some of them were but the majority were in germany for
[3:28:42.640 --> 3:28:48.480]  years before this happened and the left celebrated this they were like how dare you blame this on
[3:28:48.480 --> 3:28:54.880]  the precious refugees this is not their fault okay so it was done by people who were supposedly
[3:28:54.880 --> 3:29:01.680]  assimilated in germany had been there for years and were supposed to be integrated into society
[3:29:01.680 --> 3:29:08.480]  and yet this is the behavior they continue to carry out absolutely ludicrous so again we've
[3:29:08.480 --> 3:29:15.600]  got another top expert warning that europe and eventually america now that those syrian refugees
[3:29:15.600 --> 3:29:22.080]  are coming into in greater and greater numbers is now basically under threat of collapse of course
[3:29:22.080 --> 3:29:28.320]  it's not going to happen overnight but he warns that by 2050 europeans will be a minority in their
[3:29:28.320 --> 3:29:36.640]  own countries within just over 30 years and of course the german green party politician we played
[3:29:36.640 --> 3:29:42.720]  the clip before celebrated that fact said it's a good thing that germans are going to be completely
[3:29:42.720 --> 3:29:48.000]  replaced we'll get more into this and monies after the break it's the alex joneshow forth our
[3:29:48.000 --> 3:29:56.880]  overdrive info wars dot com stay huge the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:30:00.880 --> 3:30:05.200]  today is monday april 11th and here's some of the latest news the obama administration has
[3:30:05.200 --> 3:30:10.000]  ordered the border patrol to release illegal still soaking wet from the real grand brandon judd
[3:30:10.000 --> 3:30:14.320]  president of the national border patrol council told the house committee that agents were given
[3:30:14.320 --> 3:30:20.080]  the order soon after president obama decided to limit immigration enforcement in 2014 mr judd
[3:30:20.080 --> 3:30:24.080]  revealed that illegal immigrants have learned to game the system by claiming they arrived before
[3:30:24.080 --> 3:30:28.960]  2014 because the obama administration gives lower priority to illegals who've been in the country
[3:30:28.960 --> 3:30:33.040]  for several years he said quote the illegals are still wet from the river and miles from any
[3:30:33.040 --> 3:30:37.760]  civilization and on their word alone we release them unless we physically saw them cross the river
[3:30:37.760 --> 3:30:42.560]  in other news obama admitted he had no plans for libya after forcing goddafi out of power libya has
[3:30:42.560 --> 3:30:47.200]  been a failed state since the end of the us led coalition in 2011 which created a power vacuum
[3:30:47.200 --> 3:30:51.840]  for isis and other extremist groups to exploit islamic militants have been using libya as a base
[3:30:51.840 --> 3:30:56.880]  of operations to ship weapons of syria while steadily gaining control of libya's vast oil resources
[3:30:56.880 --> 3:31:03.440]  this is kit daniel reporting for info wars dot com more than two years ago info wars first told

[3:33:26.080 --> 3:33:30.880]  we are back at support our overdrive of the alex jones show in a little while we're going to get
[3:33:30.880 --> 3:33:38.640]  into a new women's rights cause that's being spearheaded by feminist and that is the right to
[3:33:38.640 --> 3:33:46.080]  embrace and celebrate sexually transmitted diseases this is not a joke it's not out of the onion
[3:33:46.080 --> 3:33:53.120]  it's not a 4chan troll this is actually what they're advocating it trended on twitter last week
[3:33:53.120 --> 3:33:59.280]  we're going to get into it shortly but here's an article out of sky news poll half of muslims
[3:33:59.280 --> 3:34:05.760]  want homosexuality banned just over half of muslims in britain think homosexuality should be
[3:34:05.760 --> 3:34:12.960]  illegal a survey has revealed a poll carried out by icm found that 52 percent of those quizzed
[3:34:12.960 --> 3:34:18.720]  disagree that homosexuality should be legal in britain and 47 percent said it was unacceptable
[3:34:18.720 --> 3:34:26.480]  for a gay or lesbian person to teach in school so imagine my shock they have this massive poll
[3:34:26.480 --> 3:34:32.240]  of muslim attitudes in the united kingdom it turns out that muslims are intolerant and their beliefs
[3:34:32.240 --> 3:34:39.360]  aren't compatible with liberal western society now haven't i been saying that for the past
[3:34:39.360 --> 3:34:46.880]  year or so in fact i posted this on twitter back a couple of weeks ago if you look at the uh
[3:34:47.680 --> 3:34:54.160]  approval ratings for suicide attacks throughout europe it's absolutely shocking and again debunks
[3:34:54.160 --> 3:35:02.320]  this narrative that this is only a tiny fringe minority of muslims again g hadis people who
[3:35:02.320 --> 3:35:07.840]  actually commit terror attacks who blow themselves up and kill innocent people yes that is a tiny
[3:35:07.840 --> 3:35:14.800]  fringe minority of muslims but as we saw in mollambique brussels with abdeslam the guy involved
[3:35:14.800 --> 3:35:20.960]  in the paris massacre he was able to hide out in that islamic ghetto for over three months because
[3:35:20.960 --> 3:35:27.280]  he was being helped by friends and neighbors so you don't just have jihadists that are involved in
[3:35:27.280 --> 3:35:34.400]  this you have islamists outside of that you have nominal muslims who decry this but the islamists
[3:35:34.400 --> 3:35:40.960]  are the major problem because they try they lobby in some cases they infiltrate schools
[3:35:40.960 --> 3:35:48.800]  and governments to try to impose these intolerant regressive beliefs on western society and if you
[3:35:48.800 --> 3:35:54.560]  want to live in a in an open tolerant society if you want a high standard of living if you support
[3:35:54.560 --> 3:36:01.440]  the rule of law over something abysmal and archaic like sharia law then this should be a concern
[3:36:01.440 --> 3:36:06.960]  and you can look at the support for terror attacks as i said pew did a poll of muslim attitudes and
[3:36:06.960 --> 3:36:13.680]  this is back in the news again today because of this uk survey percentage of muslims who think
[3:36:13.680 --> 3:36:21.520]  suicide bombings are justified under some circumstances so in france 31 percent of adult
[3:36:21.520 --> 3:36:30.080]  muslims over the age of 30 think suicide bombings are sometimes justified 31 percent is that a
[3:36:30.080 --> 3:36:37.520]  tiny fringe minority if you look at 18 to 29 year olds in france 42 percent of them think that
[3:36:37.520 --> 3:36:43.760]  suicide bombings are sometimes justified you can look at germany where the numbers are less but
[3:36:43.760 --> 3:36:50.800]  no less shocking 10 percent of adults say that suicide bombings are sometimes justified 22 percent
[3:36:50.800 --> 3:36:58.400]  of young people aged 18 to 29 think the same thing spain 22 percent of adults think suicide
[3:36:58.400 --> 3:37:04.560]  bombings are sometimes justified 29 percent of young people think the same then here in the uk
[3:37:04.560 --> 3:37:11.600]  17 percent of adult muslims think that suicide bombings are sometimes justified with 35 percent
[3:37:11.600 --> 3:37:19.600]  of young muslims thinking the same this is clearly a problem and it ties into this sky news article
[3:37:19.600 --> 3:37:24.560]  this survey of a thousand muslims that was just carried out over the past few days because it
[3:37:24.560 --> 3:37:32.000]  found out that a shocking shockingly only 34 percent of muslims in the united kingdom would
[3:37:32.000 --> 3:37:38.320]  tell the police if they thought someone they knew was getting involved with supporters of terrorism
[3:37:38.320 --> 3:37:49.120]  in syria so 34 percent of muslims only 34 percent would inform the police if they knew a suspected
[3:37:49.120 --> 3:37:55.120]  terrorist so again that informs us as to why over there in mollambique belgium in brussels
[3:37:56.080 --> 3:38:01.920]  abdeslam the paris massacre plotter he was involved in the attack was able to hide out for so many
[3:38:01.920 --> 3:38:08.080]  months because he was being supported by this ring of islamists who were his friends and neighbors
[3:38:08.080 --> 3:38:14.640]  who were radicalized as a result of living in these ghettos which isis in its own manifesto
[3:38:14.640 --> 3:38:21.440]  bragged was one of the main ways they would hijack the refugee crisis to create these ghettos
[3:38:21.440 --> 3:38:27.760]  which they would then radicalize create this supportive network of islamists who support
[3:38:27.760 --> 3:38:34.960]  jihadists so you know obama says that terrorism is not an existential threat and if you look at the
[3:38:34.960 --> 3:38:40.080]  figures yes it's true that you know more people generally die in swimming pool accidents more
[3:38:40.080 --> 3:38:46.000]  people die from beastings it's not an existential threat but it is a threat when these intolerant
[3:38:46.000 --> 3:38:52.880]  beliefs are imposed on western society because that's what islam is all about except from the you
[3:38:52.880 --> 3:38:58.560]  know except for the nominal muslims who don't support imposing their regressive belief system on
[3:38:58.560 --> 3:39:06.080]  the rest of us this is a problem when over half of muslims in britain think that being homosexual
[3:39:06.080 --> 3:39:11.360]  should be illegal and again that's that's a fundamentally status position you've not been
[3:39:11.360 --> 3:39:17.120]  able to do with your body what you wish with consenting adults and again only 34 percent
[3:39:17.120 --> 3:39:21.360]  would tell the police if they thought someone they knew was involved in terrorism that's
[3:39:21.360 --> 3:39:27.120]  absolutely shocking and even the former head of britain's equalities and human rights commission
[3:39:27.120 --> 3:39:34.160]  trevor phillips this is out of bright bar admitted that he got almost everything wrong on muslim
[3:39:34.160 --> 3:39:40.320]  immigration in a damning new report on integration segregation and how the followers of islam are
[3:39:40.320 --> 3:39:46.160]  creating nations within nations in the west so again you can look at these figures only one
[3:39:46.160 --> 3:39:54.000]  in five muslims in britain never enter a non muslim house only one in five 39 percent of muslims
[3:39:54.000 --> 3:39:59.040]  say women should always obey their husband 31 percent of british muslim support the right of
[3:39:59.040 --> 3:40:04.960]  a man to have more than one wife 23 percent of muslims support the introduction of sharia law
[3:40:04.960 --> 3:40:11.920]  rather than the laws laid down by parliament and when they asked american muslims the same question
[3:40:11.920 --> 3:40:19.520]  i believe it was last year over half said that they would support the introduction of sharia law
[3:40:19.520 --> 3:40:26.000]  which is not only about you know disenfranchising women in divorce courts it's about chopping people's
[3:40:26.000 --> 3:40:32.800]  hands off for stealing it's about stoning women to death or who are accused of adultery these are
[3:40:32.800 --> 3:40:38.720]  not attitudes that we should be supported we should be importing into the west because it's
[3:40:38.720 --> 3:40:45.600]  going to lead to a more regressive society a less free society and in general a lower standard of
[3:40:45.600 --> 3:40:52.240]  living now i mentioned previously isis and its own manifesto saying that they would exploit the
[3:40:52.240 --> 3:40:58.800]  refugee crisis to infiltrate jihadists to create these ghettos this is out of gateway pundit
[3:40:59.440 --> 3:41:06.240]  pakistani islamists behind mumbai attacks captured in austria after entering europe as a refugee
[3:41:06.880 --> 3:41:12.240]  well what do you know of course they captured the man in the hat last week in brussels he was
[3:41:12.240 --> 3:41:18.960]  involved in in the brussels attack he also entered europe as a refugee now muhammad ghani
[3:41:18.960 --> 3:41:25.040]  usman and abdel hadidi have been arrested at a refugee center in austria on a belief to be linked
[3:41:25.040 --> 3:41:29.040]  to terror groups and suicide bombers who blew themselves up outside the stade de france in
[3:41:29.040 --> 3:41:38.000]  paris in november usman was also behind the deadly mumbai terrorist attacks in 2008 he actually
[3:41:38.000 --> 3:41:44.080]  helped the terrorist build the bombs that were involved in that coordinated shooting and bombing
[3:41:44.080 --> 3:41:53.520]  attack that lasted for four days across mumbai remember that horror 174 people killed by these
[3:41:53.520 --> 3:41:59.520]  guys just roaming the streets with their kalashnikovs their bombs the guy who helped them make the
[3:41:59.520 --> 3:42:09.200]  bombs entered europe as a refugee arrested now but again this underscores the fact that this
[3:42:09.200 --> 3:42:15.920]  migrant red carpet that european governments have laid out is bringing in jihadists we've
[3:42:15.920 --> 3:42:22.880]  been warning about it for months we had the paris massacre the plotter of the attack who was later
[3:42:22.880 --> 3:42:30.400]  killed in a raid by police bragged about how he infiltrated through syria as a refugee into europe
[3:42:30.960 --> 3:42:36.080]  same thing with the brussels attack this is already happening i warned it would happen
[3:42:36.080 --> 3:42:42.720]  even before the paris attack sadly i was proven right and god only knows who they're not able to
[3:42:42.720 --> 3:42:50.240]  arrest these jihadists coming in through syria into greece who again are exploiting this refugee
[3:42:50.240 --> 3:42:57.520]  program but don't worry because in sweden they're busing migrants to local schools to
[3:42:57.520 --> 3:43:04.400]  reeducate the students about how they should feel about immigration of course sweden is the liberal
[3:43:04.400 --> 3:43:12.400]  basket case of europe their own expert on islamophobia left the country to join isis that's how
[3:43:12.400 --> 3:43:18.960]  trendy he was now they're busing in migrants to schools to try and reeducate young children in
[3:43:18.960 --> 3:43:24.880]  sweden this is out of bright bar again a swedish member of parliament has expressed his frustration
[3:43:24.880 --> 3:43:31.120]  after revelations a swedish school engaged in social engineering to change the political views
[3:43:31.120 --> 3:43:38.000]  of their young pupils so now they're bringing in migrants telling their sob stories because they
[3:43:38.000 --> 3:43:43.680]  were concerned about the fact that 25 percent of these students expressed support for an anti
[3:43:43.680 --> 3:43:50.080]  immigration party in sweden which is having a lot of success in the polls recently so it's right down
[3:43:50.080 --> 3:43:57.440]  to the high school level that they're now trying to reeducate people to indoctrinate them as the
[3:43:57.440 --> 3:44:03.920]  future generation who is going to be replaced by these migrants while their own leaders support it
[3:44:04.560 --> 3:44:11.840]  while young women are being raped across europe as a result of this influx again completely
[3:44:11.840 --> 3:44:20.480]  astounding and of course over in pakistan recently they struggled to pass a law to ban the quote
[3:44:20.480 --> 3:44:28.880]  right of husbands to abuse and murder their wives in honor killings as a huge campaign against that
[3:44:28.880 --> 3:44:33.360]  because they believe that under the quran and they actually cite the quranic verses where it
[3:44:33.360 --> 3:44:40.560]  justifies this they should have the right to physically abuse and murder their own wives and
[3:44:40.560 --> 3:44:47.040]  daughters of course you would expect there would be a massive feminist outcry against this of course
[3:44:47.040 --> 3:44:53.600]  a huge violation of women's rights placing women in extreme danger they were about to pass the law
[3:44:53.600 --> 3:44:59.440]  which would hopefully begin to bring this to an end are feminists out on the street in protest
[3:44:59.440 --> 3:45:07.120]  against the people who are trying to prevent this law going through well no they're celebrating how
[3:45:07.120 --> 3:45:13.840]  stds are a new form of female empowerment that's right this is not a joke there's actually a video
[3:45:13.840 --> 3:45:19.680]  i put out a couple of hours ago up on info wars dot com called feminists celebrate sexually
[3:45:19.680 --> 3:45:26.400]  transmitted diseases now this wasn't just a gaggle of you know insane people on twitter on tumblr
[3:45:26.400 --> 3:45:33.200]  this was actually quite a prominent feminist behind this campaign ele dorsen and she's being given a
[3:45:33.200 --> 3:45:40.640]  lot of positive press over this new women's rights movement which is about embracing and
[3:45:40.640 --> 3:45:48.960]  championing stds things like gonorrhea and herpes as a new women's rights movement because
[3:45:48.960 --> 3:45:54.320]  they shouldn't be publicly shamed they shouldn't be shamed at all for having these diseases so of
[3:45:54.320 --> 3:46:01.440]  course she's a self-described feminist imagine my shock she's a gender studies graduate who says
[3:46:01.440 --> 3:46:10.000]  that she's herpes positive and quote pretty cool with it this is the tweet she sent out a few days
[3:46:10.000 --> 3:46:16.480]  ago on twitter part of this trending hashtag it actually started trending on twitter i believe it
[3:46:16.480 --> 3:46:22.000]  was on friday night she said quote this is one of the top feminists being celebrated by the mainstream
[3:46:22.000 --> 3:46:30.480]  media i'm not interested in playing identity politics i'm a slot and i have herpes i still
[3:46:30.480 --> 3:46:38.800]  am a person who deserves respect so this is the new cause that they've embraced having herpes
[3:46:38.800 --> 3:46:46.320]  having gonorrhea not by accident as a result in her own words because she's a slot this is the new
[3:46:46.320 --> 3:46:52.080]  thing that they're educating young women to embrace so again i don't need to go into the gory
[3:46:52.080 --> 3:46:58.240]  details of herpes but obviously it's a lifelong incurable disease you can only treat the symptoms
[3:46:58.240 --> 3:47:05.680]  it can damage the central nervous system it can lead to Alzheimer's again feminists hate women
[3:47:05.680 --> 3:47:10.480]  this is the point i make over and over again they got behind a body acceptance movement
[3:47:11.120 --> 3:47:17.520]  the teachers women being chronically obese is a social justice cause okay it's not a social
[3:47:17.520 --> 3:47:22.640]  justice cause having something that can lead to Alzheimer's having something that can damage
[3:47:22.640 --> 3:47:29.360]  your central nervous system that's unhealthy we shouldn't be promoting the embracement of that
[3:47:29.360 --> 3:47:34.880]  by young women it's not a social justice course so again it goes on and all these tweets are
[3:47:34.880 --> 3:47:41.680]  featured in the article again it was given positive press coverage this is what maintains this
[3:47:41.680 --> 3:47:46.160]  absolutely insane narrative that these third wave feminists come up with over and over again
[3:47:46.880 --> 3:47:54.320]  revelist.com put out an article praising this movement praising this glorification of sexually
[3:47:54.320 --> 3:48:02.160]  transmitted diseases as quote brave individuals fighting sti stigma and shouting their status
[3:48:02.160 --> 3:48:10.880]  so you've got women in Iran pulling off their hijabs being threatened with rape for doing
[3:48:10.880 --> 3:48:16.160]  so because they're actually fighting for genuine women's rights issues but that's not important
[3:48:16.800 --> 3:48:23.280]  embracing the fact that you've got gonorrhea that's important to feminists this is why third wave
[3:48:23.280 --> 3:48:30.160]  feminism is again incredibly harmful to women here's another tweet that was sent out under
[3:48:30.160 --> 3:48:36.720]  the shout your status hashtag which started trending on twitter on friday quote i have her
[3:48:36.720 --> 3:48:45.280]  piece type one the kind most folks have orally i have it genitally it's no big deal most people
[3:48:45.280 --> 3:48:54.320]  have it i'm still hot af well as i point out in the video having an unsightly lifelong incurable
[3:48:54.320 --> 3:49:02.640]  infection that gives you brain damage is not hot something that makes your nether regions look
[3:49:02.640 --> 3:49:09.360]  like a methodics face that's not hot but again this is the major human rights cause that feminists
[3:49:09.360 --> 3:49:16.560]  have now embraced while in pakistan women are fighting for a law to prevent them from being
[3:49:16.560 --> 3:49:23.520]  physically abused and murdered in honor killings this is the total disconnect between third wave
[3:49:23.520 --> 3:49:30.000]  feminism and actual women's rights which they consistently ignore here's another tweet that
[3:49:30.000 --> 3:49:34.640]  was sent out under this hashtag and apologies if you're eating your lunch or dinner right now
[3:49:35.280 --> 3:49:40.720]  because this is pretty disgusting but we have to point out that it's disgusting because the media
[3:49:40.720 --> 3:49:47.120]  is treating it as a social justice issue quote i'll keep saying it until i'm blue in the face
[3:49:47.120 --> 3:49:53.760]  STIs are not a consequence of poor decisions or bad character well yes they are again this is this
[3:49:53.760 --> 3:49:59.680]  whole narcissistic societal attitude that we've got going on right now amongst the left amongst
[3:49:59.680 --> 3:50:07.120]  the social justice warriors that nothing whatsoever is their fault that they're so entitled they don't
[3:50:07.120 --> 3:50:13.680]  need to take responsibility for their actions but it goes even deeper than that you know we've got
[3:50:13.680 --> 3:50:19.440]  this whole thing of self-empowerment but it's not even real self-empowerment it's completely phony
[3:50:20.000 --> 3:50:25.760]  this narrative that encourages people to celebrate anything and everything as a form of empowerment
[3:50:26.320 --> 3:50:33.440]  just like the fat pride movement celebrating being chronically obese having heart problems
[3:50:33.440 --> 3:50:40.240]  having diabetes as something praiseworthy as something that everybody else should embrace
[3:50:40.240 --> 3:50:47.680]  and if they god forbid criticize you for that for daring to suggest that being obese is a bad lifestyle
[3:50:47.680 --> 3:50:54.160]  choice getting herpes getting std's is a bad lifestyle choice then they're harassing you

[3:54:21.440 --> 3:54:28.160]  transmitted diseases as a form of female empowerment and again it's all about this narcissistic

[3:54:35.920 --> 3:54:42.160]  negative behavior we had an article back in march blogger celebrates her awesome abortion
[3:54:42.160 --> 3:54:49.600]  it was a joyful experience so again it's about flipping this a 180 completely taking something
[3:54:49.600 --> 3:54:56.800]  that is sick no matter what you think about abortion celebrating it as some wonderful human
[3:54:56.800 --> 3:55:05.440]  right is completely demented celebrating sexually transmitted diseases as something you know empowering
[3:55:05.440 --> 3:55:12.640]  to women that's harmful to women why i say it again and again feminists hate women they promote
[3:55:12.640 --> 3:55:18.400]  causes which are actually harmful to women that are harmful to gender relations and this is just
[3:55:18.400 --> 3:55:25.600]  the latest example of that so go check out that video on info wars dot com feminists celebrate
[3:55:25.600 --> 3:55:32.560]  sexually transmitted diseases get that video and share it now before the uh before the segment that
[3:55:32.560 --> 3:55:38.000]  i came on alex was talking about obama and playing this clip where he claims that the economic
[3:55:38.000 --> 3:55:44.800]  recovery saving america from the great depression was one of his greatest achievements well now
[3:55:44.800 --> 3:55:50.160]  top fed official has come out and said america no longer top country to achieve american dream
[3:55:50.960 --> 3:55:56.160]  federal reserve official william dudley said america is no longer the top country for achieving
[3:55:56.160 --> 3:56:02.560]  the american dream in remarks on economic opportunity and income mobility at a conference in new york on
[3:56:02.560 --> 3:56:08.640]  monday quote while income mobility in the united states has been relatively unchanged it remains
[3:56:08.640 --> 3:56:14.960]  well below several other nations the probability of moving from the bottom quintile to the top quintile
[3:56:14.960 --> 3:56:22.240]  is 7.5 percent in the u.s as compared to 11.7 percent in denmark and 13.5 percent in canada
[3:56:22.240 --> 3:56:30.880]  so even the socialist havens of canada and denmark are now outperforming the united states
[3:56:30.880 --> 3:56:38.080]  in terms of this metric which again is why trump has proven so popular with the blue color voters
[3:56:38.080 --> 3:56:45.200]  they've seen their jobs shipped offshore they've seen a complete lack of that ability to be socially
[3:56:45.200 --> 3:56:50.560]  mobile that's been taken away from them and that's why they're coming out in droves for donald trump
[3:56:50.560 --> 3:56:56.800]  over in venezuela of course a couple of days ago again on twitter we had the hashtag trending
[3:56:56.800 --> 3:57:04.560]  resist capitalism they were tweeting it from their iphone's using twitter and the internet all three
[3:57:04.560 --> 3:57:11.520]  of which wouldn't exist without capitalism and now the perfect example of what happens when you do
[3:57:11.520 --> 3:57:18.000]  resist capitalism is coming to the fore in venezuela this is zero hedge it's pure chaos now
[3:57:18.000 --> 3:57:23.840]  there's no way back venezuela morgues are overflowing they've basically gone to a four day
[3:57:23.840 --> 3:57:29.280]  week everything's beginning to collapse they talked about people who work in the morgue there
[3:57:30.000 --> 3:57:36.240]  who were a decade ago receiving seven or eight bodies every weekend these days this is a quote
[3:57:36.240 --> 3:57:44.880]  that number has risen to between 40 and 50 this is now wilder than the wild west there are widespread
[3:57:44.880 --> 3:57:51.360]  reports of lynching there's a lack of basic goods analysts warn the economic crisis risk turning it
[3:57:51.360 --> 3:57:58.000]  into a humanitarian one so it's gone from just there not being enough toilet paper on the shelves
[3:57:58.000 --> 3:58:04.240]  now lynchings are happening the body count is rising and this is what happens in the final stages
[3:58:04.240 --> 3:58:10.800]  of the collapse of a socialist country so i would suggest that we don't resist free market
[3:58:10.800 --> 3:58:16.880]  capitalism and that we embrace it a couple of final stories gallup is reporting us worries
[3:58:16.880 --> 3:58:21.280]  about race relations reach a new high well of course that's because of the incredibly divisive
[3:58:21.280 --> 3:58:26.480]  and harmful black lives matter movement which mainstream media and obama has supported so
