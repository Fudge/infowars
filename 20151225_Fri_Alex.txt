[00:00.000 --> 00:16.960]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you right from the front lines of the info war

[00:33.520 --> 00:41.800]  accomplished director actor the progeny of the great and mighty King Norris will be joining us in
[00:41.800 --> 00:48.040]  studio I'm a little bit wound up okay only one cup of coffee so far today but I am wound up right
[00:48.040 --> 00:56.080]  now I am wound up I am angry I just I get upset but I get happy when I'm fighting tyranny so
[00:56.080 --> 00:59.760]  thank you for putting up with me I'm gonna control myself now I'll be totally exhausted by this
[00:59.760 --> 01:03.920]  evening if I continue to bounce all over the walls here but that's what's happening dims
[01:03.920 --> 01:09.360]  proposed civil rights free legals ISIS to enter the US kit Daniels info wars dot com
[01:09.360 --> 01:15.760]  senator sessions has released the plan that they're planning to put their Congress any alien
[01:15.760 --> 01:20.040]  denied entry could file suit to demand entry and claims damages that's for the lawyers to make
[01:20.040 --> 01:25.480]  money to for lost employment lost welfare benefits lost income and they want to let ISIS in we'll
[01:25.480 --> 01:30.960]  break this down coming up later in the hour but Alex Newman again you had the fortune or
[01:30.960 --> 01:35.560]  misfortune of joining me today in the last hour when I was in particular piranha mode
[01:35.560 --> 01:41.240]  what you're right though this is the battle the enemies inside the gates it's actually the
[01:41.240 --> 01:45.480]  animating contest of liberty what can we do to expose the fact that the entire West is being
[01:45.480 --> 01:51.280]  usurped into an anti-human eugenics world government as we speak I think one of the best
[01:51.280 --> 01:55.120]  things that people can do is first of all educate themselves and then spread the word you know
[01:55.120 --> 01:59.880]  share Alex Jones program through your Twitter through your Facebook with your friends share the
[01:59.880 --> 02:04.400]  new Americans articles get the information out there so that people realize because what I've
[02:04.400 --> 02:08.000]  found and we've interviewed a number of people who used to be global warming alarmists we
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.800]  interviewed an engineer who quit his job to get involved in stopping global warming until he
[02:12.800 --> 02:17.520]  realized it was all a fraud so the facts are compelling the truth stands on its own yes the
[02:17.520 --> 02:22.640]  globalists have billions trillions of dollars yes they had controlled all the big media and you
[02:22.640 --> 02:28.160]  know they're the rock stars here but you know the truth stands on its own we don't need the billions
[02:28.160 --> 02:34.160]  of dollars we need the facts we need the truth and with those two weapons we can stop this scam
[02:34.160 --> 02:38.800]  and once the American people are sufficiently educated we can work with our elected officials
[02:38.800 --> 02:42.400]  and you know Congress could very easily stop this every Republican in Congress
[02:43.040 --> 02:47.920]  ran on a platform of stopping Obama now you have an opportunity to stop Obama when you pass the
[02:47.920 --> 02:53.360]  budget say not one penny of this budget is going to climate negotiations not one penny of this
[02:53.360 --> 02:57.760]  budget is going to the cap and trade that you couldn't even get through the democrat controlled
[02:57.760 --> 03:02.000]  congress not one penny of this money is going for the gun grab not one penny this money is going
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.480]  for any of Obama's agenda so Republicans who say oh we can't do anything we need to win the White House
[03:06.480 --> 03:10.880]  they're not telling the truth they control the power of the purse so if we get educated if we
[03:10.880 --> 03:17.440]  educate our communities if we educate our lawmakers we can stop this and we can do it without a lot
[03:17.440 --> 03:21.520]  of work and without a lot of problems if we let it continue if we let it go on until we lose the
[03:21.520 --> 03:26.320]  means of resisting you know at that point then maybe it's time to start panicking but for now
[03:26.320 --> 03:30.640]  we still have all the opportunities all in the world to put a stop to this we have all the
[03:30.640 --> 03:37.840]  the necessary tools to resist this and we need to get busy don't squeeze only tickle do it right
[03:37.840 --> 03:41.600]  there goes Schwarzenegger again right and there's a whole bunch of nutty american officials here
[03:41.600 --> 03:46.000]  you have the EPA chief here who's the one in charge of implementing all of obama i mean i didn't want
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.960]  to go off on regular snager i mean i love some of his earlier movies like running man and predator
[03:50.960 --> 03:55.120]  and cut into barbarian is just amazingly not going on the destroyer that is that's comedy
[03:55.120 --> 03:59.920]  but calling the barbarian uh is amazing i like Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor quite frankly
[03:59.920 --> 04:05.360]  but as a person he's an oppressive evil he makes Lance Armstrong look like a humanitarian i mean
[04:05.360 --> 04:10.160]  the stuff he's been involved in the arrogance just i hate him he's he's just the antithesis of
[04:10.160 --> 04:15.600]  americana and i just i and i literally just just want him out of my life i mean he literally is
[04:15.600 --> 04:20.640]  perching on me with immunization trying to take over all the major cities and put us under carbon
[04:20.640 --> 04:25.200]  tax one way or the other i mean i'm sure as you know alex he quarterbacks that whole operation
[04:25.200 --> 04:29.920]  yep and you know he's a good representative for the type of people who are here at this
[04:29.920 --> 04:34.560]  un summit they're you know at at least at the upper levels they're all totalitarian they're
[04:34.560 --> 04:39.920]  all incredible hypocrites and they all want to like Arnold Schwarzenegger you control your life
[04:39.920 --> 04:44.800]  and so people need to understand he says he admires hitler let listen alex thank you so much great
[04:44.800 --> 04:49.040]  job post can read your reports without all my screaming but we need we need some screaming too
[04:49.040 --> 04:52.960]  at the new american magazine new american dot com thank you so much brother we'll be talking to you
[04:52.960 --> 04:58.720]  again soon after you get back from paris thank you so much my daughter did you know governments
[04:58.720 --> 05:02.400]  around the world are attacking your free speech online in an attempt to control the internet
[05:02.400 --> 05:07.120]  like cable tv for one thing governments are paying online trolls to sway public opinion the turkish
[05:07.120 --> 05:11.440]  israeli and chinese governments along with a host of others are paying companies to quote correct
[05:11.440 --> 05:16.480]  misinformation on web forms and the u.s government has even hired a data security firm to create large
[05:16.480 --> 05:21.200]  numbers of fake social media profiles that could be used to spread propaganda while also encountering
[05:21.200 --> 05:25.360]  anti-establishment viewpoints online also an increasing number of mainstream news outlets are
[05:25.360 --> 05:29.840]  disabling or severely restricting comment sections to sodden out critics that challenge the prevailing
[05:29.840 --> 05:34.640]  status quo pushed by the media for example popular science said it was killing its comment section
[05:34.640 --> 05:39.120]  to silence global warming skeptics in other words they don't want readers to have the ability to
[05:39.120 --> 05:43.520]  sway public opinion against their agenda the ultimate end game is to both eradicate free speech on
[05:43.520 --> 05:47.520]  the internet and to turn the internet into a tightly controlled medium where only government
[05:47.520 --> 05:51.200]  approved viewpoints are allowed in other words governments want to bury the truth found on the
[05:51.200 --> 05:55.360]  internet in favor of government lies you can find out more about the war on the internet info

[09:09.520 --> 09:17.360]  about all the censorship and things that it has you know basically gone through what about the idea
[09:17.360 --> 09:25.600]  of drafting chuck norris 2016 i think he would be even way more invincible and measured and what he
[09:25.600 --> 09:31.360]  said uh than somebody like even donald trump and i like donald trump he's been on he obviously is the
[09:31.360 --> 09:36.160]  big republican leader or what about a chuck norris donald trump take a minute i know your dad is known
[09:36.160 --> 09:41.440]  for being uh super incredibly humble never i've seen at republican events over time you don't
[09:41.440 --> 09:45.360]  like people really complimenting him but i mean come on we need somebody who's been a filmmaker

[10:05.360 --> 10:09.760]  inside the beltway people that are smoking their own dope but but mike norris before we get into
[10:09.760 --> 10:14.960]  america and uh all things chuck norris you always tell me some cool stuff behind the scenes baseball
[10:14.960 --> 10:18.560]  and we're gonna work at your dad on soon but he's really kind of been chilling out writing for
[10:18.560 --> 10:25.360]  world net daily and he deserves that uh but wow i mean america needs chuck norris how great would
[10:25.360 --> 10:31.040]  that be to have my dad as a president of the united states i mean it's been great to uh kind of
[10:31.040 --> 10:38.800]  witness his uh evolution into the film industry but wow president would be great i i i'm in i'd
[10:38.800 --> 10:43.200]  love to go to the white house to see him there how long was he the top grossing action figure ever
[10:43.200 --> 10:47.360]  i mean wasn't like a decade he was the top grossing of all time yeah every four months he'd have a new
[10:47.360 --> 10:53.200]  film come out number one in the box office and uh it was great that was you know the 80s and 90s and
[10:53.200 --> 10:58.560]  then he started on walker texas ranger and that just kind of took it to a whole nether level
[10:58.560 --> 11:03.600]  you know they can say they're gonna have come era clones now we could get dig up john wane
[11:03.600 --> 11:08.720]  and then your dad could donate some stem cells we could create a john wane chuck norris uh creature
[11:09.520 --> 11:15.920]  i i i man let's throw a little alex jones in there too no no no we'll throw donald trump's hair
[11:15.920 --> 11:21.680]  in genetically the creature will have donald trump's hair i like his hair what's wrong with it i hear
[11:21.680 --> 11:28.320]  you we'll mix in we'll mix in some elvis oh we'll dig up george washington mix in some of that
[11:28.320 --> 11:34.960]  little ronald reagan sure we won't be mixing any sports in agar in or clinton or clinton no
[11:35.600 --> 11:41.600]  uh hillary though so beautiful sorry just spit up a little bit but no i mean could your dad be
[11:41.600 --> 11:45.840]  convinced i mean i know people brought it up to him what would his reservations be i mean if any of
[11:45.840 --> 11:54.160]  running for president you know uh i i i think the idea of it is really cool but you know he's uh
[11:54.160 --> 12:00.160]  he's so much into his foundation his kickstart foundation helping kids uh helping kids um he's
[12:00.160 --> 12:06.400]  starting a new water company seaforce water so he's busy right now uh but he's very in tune with
[12:06.400 --> 12:13.120]  what's happening in the world he's very in tune with uh the media knowing full well the media
[12:13.120 --> 12:19.120]  is the mainstream media is a lie and i think that's uh that's important because we need people like
[12:19.120 --> 12:27.200]  you and my father to let people know fox cnn abc mbc it's all a lie and if you really want to get
[12:27.200 --> 12:32.080]  news the where do we go we go to alex we go to grudge we we go to bright part that that's where
[12:32.080 --> 12:37.200]  we got to go now to get our information so is it surprising to you that it came out fbi
[12:37.200 --> 12:41.360]  agents others have said they were blocked from investigating this couple and that mosque and
[12:41.360 --> 12:44.480]  actually had the civil rights commission from the white house sent down to stop them
[12:46.000 --> 12:49.680]  ridiculous and then now it came out confirmed that the white house ordered the fbi to say this
[12:49.680 --> 12:57.440]  wasn't terrorism uh yeah i i watched it uh kind of unfold uh interestingly enough the day donald
[12:57.440 --> 13:03.280]  was on your show i'm fixated on watching donald trump on your show and then two hours later this
[13:03.280 --> 13:09.520]  this thing happens i'm watching it unfold and slowly but surely i'd watch fox i'd watch cnn
[13:09.520 --> 13:15.920]  but everything from fox eight they'd say his name uh was a muslim name and then two hours later
[13:15.920 --> 13:23.840]  cnn would have to uh they were muslims it was but it wasn't tear no no gosh no it wasn't tear
[13:23.840 --> 13:29.200]  not not at all i mean vest bombs going to pakistan and it turns out the government knew
[13:29.200 --> 13:36.320]  order the fbi to stand out that's to me how about them letting the media in the apartment one two
[13:36.320 --> 13:41.120]  days later cameras inside the apartment that's a crime the bed hadn't even been turned no the
[13:41.120 --> 13:45.200]  walls hadn't been torn out normally in a real attack like this if they didn't want to get rid of
[13:45.200 --> 13:49.680]  the crime scene they would it'd be closed for months yeah absolutely absolutely and that's
[13:49.680 --> 13:53.920]  why i named gary here for this i mean this now let's talk about let's talk about the guy that
[13:53.920 --> 13:57.840]  absolutely let's get into the film let's talk about america and we're going to be playing the
[13:57.840 --> 14:02.960]  trailer coming up at the bottom of the hour the trailer is now an info wars dot com uh and let's
[14:02.960 --> 14:09.280]  talk about people like gary taking action to make this film you know gary and diane diane haven to
[14:09.280 --> 14:16.560]  me are amazing people here's the guy that has created a successful company a successful business
[14:16.560 --> 14:22.240]  has all the money in the world could do whatever he wants and what he has decided to do is he's
[14:22.240 --> 14:27.520]  going to stand up he's going to put his money up and he's going to create content create films that
[14:27.520 --> 14:32.800]  is to expose the elites of the world this is just the beginning you're ready to announce this this
[14:32.800 --> 14:37.040]  is it all right we'll go ahead and tell folks about it we're launching the facebook for the first
[14:37.040 --> 14:43.440]  time the website the trailer america and the movie dot com links and info wars dot com facebook
[14:43.440 --> 14:48.880]  twitter will this film save the world by itself no will this show do it by itself no will mic norris
[14:48.880 --> 14:54.960]  by himself no or chuck norris at world net daily no but all of us together standing up to the new
[14:54.960 --> 14:59.200]  world order standing up to what's happening the truth will expose what they're doing and so it's
[14:59.200 --> 15:04.960]  very important that you make this film a hit it's very entertaining but very informative it's very
[15:04.960 --> 15:09.440]  important that when it comes out in theaters you see it when it's on demand you watch it uh that
[15:09.440 --> 15:15.520]  when it then hits dvd blu ray you get it because we're building an alternative media and when you
[15:15.520 --> 15:19.760]  come that's actually what helps us build it bigger it's kind of like fill the dreams build it they
[15:19.760 --> 15:25.040]  will come build something they will come but then we you start supporting it gets bigger and bigger
[15:25.040 --> 15:29.280]  and that's what the system is afraid of we got those documents from the clinton foundation
[15:29.280 --> 15:34.080]  20 years ago saying we got to shut down this internet what happens if christians and libertarians
[15:34.080 --> 15:39.680]  and conservatives use it that'll be it for us so the talking point was call them conspiracy theorist
[15:39.680 --> 15:46.480]  call them racist sick the irs on them and 20 years later what do we see him doing exactly that exactly
[15:46.480 --> 15:52.400]  that getting back to the film your dad warns you too didn't he but yeah he did and he warned me again
[15:52.400 --> 16:00.560]  after he saw the film he goes uh just so you know you are now on the list what list the hit list
[16:00.560 --> 16:06.560]  and you know what i wear that badge with honor uh because if i'm doing and he was saying that
[16:06.560 --> 16:13.520]  good i mean the good way to you he had a good way uh hey i don't want to die for this movie uh
[16:13.520 --> 16:17.280]  and i'm not putting words your mouth he told me at the time he said he was proud of you absolutely
[16:17.280 --> 16:23.840]  absolutely he loved the movie uh we have his full support on the film so um that's a huge
[16:23.840 --> 16:30.080]  blessing to us um but today is a big day i mean this is a movie we've been working on for a year
[16:30.080 --> 16:36.640]  and a half uh it's a concept of gary havens who i wish he could be here right now but he is uh
[16:36.640 --> 16:41.520]  taking care of business somewhere in the world i don't know i'll find out next week when i see him
[16:42.640 --> 16:48.560]  but this was his brain he's like a james bond character himself he really is he is so fascinating
[16:49.440 --> 16:54.640]  so knowledgeable and i you know it's kind of like talking to you you just kind of get sucked in and
[16:54.640 --> 16:59.680]  all you're too nice no but he's more interesting than i am he and he's so knowledgeable and he's so
[16:59.680 --> 17:04.800]  passionate and like i said here's a guy that could have done whatever he wants i can he could go to
[17:04.800 --> 17:10.720]  his island he could go to us he's got property everywhere very well set up but this is what he
[17:10.720 --> 17:19.520]  decided this is important to him he wants to expose the corruption the demonic elite that is really
[17:19.520 --> 17:23.120]  i don't have a dinner with him and breakfast and stuff for this wife they are really focused they're
[17:23.120 --> 17:28.880]  really serious very very serious very serious and he's helped inform governor at it and stuff
[17:28.880 --> 17:36.080]  absolutely he is set down with um all of them basically pretty much all of them and um you
[17:36.080 --> 17:41.840]  know those are those are his his inside baseball that i that i wasn't part of so i don't know
[17:41.840 --> 17:46.160]  exactly what was he was telling me that a lot of people are awake now which which i pick up on
[17:46.160 --> 17:51.840]  as well talking to folks yeah slowly but surely you know slowly but surely and that's why this film
[17:51.840 --> 17:57.280]  america is so important because you know we we get our information in different ways um you know
[17:57.280 --> 18:04.320]  i enjoy your show every day um i enjoy movies uh that you know i enjoy a lot of movies now one
[18:04.320 --> 18:09.520]  thing that's interesting is hollywood puts out these kind of movies but what they do is they
[18:09.520 --> 18:16.960]  disguise it in uh animation and they just kind of hit the fringe of what's really happening it's
[18:16.960 --> 18:23.280]  almost like they're wanting us to i that's a question i had for you ten years ago you'd see no
[18:23.280 --> 18:30.640]  anti-new world order stuff now superman uh the new um captain america so many of these plots
[18:30.640 --> 18:37.040]  are false flags corrupt groups you folks say it's like my show what do you think that's about no i
[18:37.040 --> 18:41.760]  i think you're a hundred percent right i i think what they're trying to do is dumb us down desensitize
[18:41.760 --> 18:47.600]  us to what's really happening so when it does take place so it's like okay well it's here we
[18:47.600 --> 18:53.200]  kind of saw it coming well i don't buy that they're taking the edge off they're taking the edge off
[18:53.200 --> 18:58.960]  and a lot of people are buying it what we're doing with america is we've just ripped off all the shiny
[18:58.960 --> 19:04.480]  pretty uh stuff that they put in their films and we just tell the truth we call out who we need to
[19:04.480 --> 19:12.720]  call out and we tell a story within the confines of what's going on in the world it's uh you get the
[19:12.720 --> 19:21.280]  break uh yeah really what it's about is us taking our freedom back from the government that's what
[19:21.280 --> 19:27.680]  we need to do the government is running our lives we're taking our freedom back and ideas are bullet
[19:27.680 --> 19:33.200]  proof this is revolutionary i i've seen no exaggerations since i'm on on air 20 something years
[19:33.200 --> 19:39.280]  more than 30 or 40 made for tv shows other films where it's always a radio host in a bunker leading
[19:39.280 --> 19:43.520]  revolution against the government blowing up schools full of children and in a lot of the shows
[19:43.520 --> 19:48.960]  that he's even named alex uh or it'll say from texas alex johnson and they'll barely and then i'm
[19:48.960 --> 19:55.280]  killing everyone and then all and that's just them attacking me and others they've got shows where
[19:55.280 --> 20:00.960]  green lantern fights guys would try corner hats that want to put poison the new york bay i mean
[20:00.960 --> 20:08.080]  they just everywhere are demonizing patriots and and going after us so you're basically countering
[20:08.080 --> 20:12.080]  them but but not with hidden propaganda you're just putting it right out there against them
[20:12.080 --> 20:20.240]  right right out in your face uh it is like gary likes to say this is a true story that hasn't
[20:20.240 --> 20:26.720]  happened yet but it will but it will well look at europe they've used the radical islamic invasion
[20:26.720 --> 20:33.920]  they brought in they advertised to declare civil emergency and draconian martial law laws in germany
[20:33.920 --> 20:38.480]  and france where they ban demonstrations of nationalist groups but then let the socialists
[20:38.480 --> 20:43.680]  run around the streets yeah yeah i i it was in full display of what was going on with the military
[20:43.680 --> 20:49.120]  in the streets and locking down the streets martial law it is coming it's just a matter of time
[20:50.160 --> 20:54.160]  then they misrepresent we come out and say hey here's this jade helm army dot mill
[20:54.160 --> 20:57.680]  home uh they say it's you know practicing to take over hostile areas we don't believe this
[20:57.680 --> 21:02.480]  is a minute takeover but it's more conditioning of our troops to accept this they spin it alex
[21:02.480 --> 21:06.000]  jones hates the military says they're coming to texas this summer to kill everybody and take
[21:06.000 --> 21:11.360]  their guns and then since they put that out people don't trust the government they get scared
[21:11.360 --> 21:16.560]  from what hundreds of newspapers and tv stations said they get scared by the media saying that
[21:16.560 --> 21:20.880]  and believe it's happening because my name's attached to it and then they come out and say see
[21:20.880 --> 21:24.480]  it didn't happen alex jones was a liar and when i'm not talking about myself here folks you
[21:24.480 --> 21:29.360]  just need to know these are the tricks they engage in yeah no i i agree with you i agree
[21:29.360 --> 21:37.760]  with you 100 there it's um it's crazy the rabbit hole they're trying to push us down and i'm done
[21:37.760 --> 21:45.600]  i'm you know i was always kind of a quiet um you know i didn't want to jump off the cliff 100
[21:45.600 --> 21:51.440]  percent i wanted to hold back a little bit i had my views i believe everything you're talking about
[21:51.440 --> 21:57.360]  but i i was just holding back and it's not until now where we really need to make that choice are
[21:57.360 --> 22:02.880]  we in or are we out because you can't play in the middle if you get played in the middle you're dead
[22:02.880 --> 22:07.920]  never true words have been spoken than what you just said mike norris i always think about the
[22:07.920 --> 22:12.000]  fact i've got to intensify what i'm doing work even harder or i got to completely quit i can't
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.560]  just back off halfway or back off 80 percent and then it's a choice i mean i could take my
[22:16.560 --> 22:19.600]  children fishing and hunting more i could be in better shape though i'm trying to get back in
[22:19.600 --> 22:24.240]  better shape i could but i've just made the choice i'm all in i'm 100 committed that's it
[22:24.240 --> 22:30.240]  i'm done i couldn't do it any other way yeah no i i agree with you and that's why it's so important
[22:30.240 --> 22:35.920]  on this film that we get the support that we get the people to go to the american facebook page
[22:35.920 --> 22:43.680]  the american the film uh website to really support us because that this is it we are going full in to
[22:43.680 --> 22:50.080]  create content that is going to expose what is happening behind the scenes and there is a demonic
[22:50.080 --> 22:55.840]  elite and i really believe it's a spiritual warfare behind it all there is a spiritual warfare
[22:55.840 --> 22:59.280]  going on that is dictating what's happening i want to talk more about that right now than
[22:59.280 --> 23:03.200]  come back and play the trailer we just kept this network break uh you're just announcing the trailer
[23:03.200 --> 23:07.760]  today you're just launching it the facebook just got launched minutes ago 300 something likes
[23:07.760 --> 23:11.520]  i want to put up the top of our main facebook that has a million followers and the others that
[23:11.520 --> 23:16.880]  have several million as well twitter uh everywhere but i want to ask listeners you have the real power
[23:16.880 --> 23:21.520]  when i get up here and push something at reaches a few million people if you don't decide to take
[23:21.520 --> 23:25.840]  action and carry that ball it does nothing i want to see five million views 10 million views
[23:25.840 --> 23:33.360]  conservatively by next week on the american trailer i want to see you know a couple hundred
[23:33.360 --> 23:40.480]  thousand likes per minimum on the on the american facebook and on the website because again this is
[23:40.480 --> 23:47.600]  about creating patriot anti-globalist markets for this type of material and if this is even
[23:47.600 --> 23:53.360]  moderately successful then they're going to commit to a flotilla of not just these films but other
[23:53.360 --> 23:58.560]  films we've been talking behind the scenes a lot of stuff this is about leaving hollywood
[23:58.560 --> 24:02.720]  leaving the censorship and and and really putting your money with your mouth is i mean it's hard to
[24:02.720 --> 24:09.120]  have jets and helicopters and full crime how big was this budget millions and millions of dollars
[24:09.120 --> 24:17.040]  we're not going to say um mr haven was very generous but he is very smart and uh so we had
[24:17.040 --> 24:22.640]  some guidelines but i had everything i needed to make this film well i mean i've been on some
[24:22.640 --> 24:27.200]  pretty big films and as a consultant but also in them you know fell into some link letter
[24:27.200 --> 24:31.600]  films he invited me to be in and this this was bigger crews and budgets and it was pretty
[24:31.600 --> 24:37.360]  professional yeah we had a great time a great crew um you know and it's interesting because a lot of
[24:37.360 --> 24:42.800]  the people that just came on to work on the film are getting really skittish right now i've had phone
[24:42.800 --> 24:47.840]  calls uh could you change my name in the credits by the way because you guys got a bunch of big
[24:47.840 --> 24:53.520]  actors and actresses tell folks yeah yeah we've got uh dina mire annalyn mccord we have got the
[24:53.520 --> 24:59.680]  awesome marshal teague marshal teague to me is one of the most brilliant actors uh we've got this guy
[24:59.680 --> 25:07.280]  he played really a great part alex jones on about the movie no but what was awesome about that was we
[25:07.280 --> 25:13.760]  go can you play something different we want you to play the bad guy we want you to be the enemy
[25:13.760 --> 25:19.440]  and you pulled it off with mastery oh you're nice it was uh it was certainly fun and uh
[25:20.640 --> 25:24.560]  i just would love to do it again now let's get into the demonic nature of all of this
[25:24.560 --> 25:30.240]  with mike norris the film america and america the movie dot com folks put it on your facebook on
[25:30.240 --> 25:34.160]  your twitter please send it out to your friends and family uh these guys have really committed
[25:34.160 --> 25:38.080]  to do this and you don't want to get a lot into it on the air it sounds like whining or complaining
[25:38.080 --> 25:41.280]  it's a badge of courage before we get into the demonic stuff which we'll do after the break
[25:41.280 --> 25:46.640]  talk about the censorship i mean people don't know that homeland security visited a major tv
[25:46.640 --> 25:51.360]  network that i was doing a show with and actually threatened them and i'm not allowed to say what
[25:51.360 --> 25:55.440]  else happened and it really makes me mad but i was told in confidence so i can't tell you but
[25:56.560 --> 26:01.840]  it was bad and then i mean people don't know what goes on behind the scenes to shut stuff down
[26:01.840 --> 26:06.000]  i've been thrown off xm thrown off a bunch of affiliates the stations get threatened people
[26:06.000 --> 26:11.120]  coming off for a money i mean hundreds of thousands of dollars just for a few months just to get me off
[26:11.120 --> 26:17.040]  i mean there is a real move in this country so understand you that's why i have kinship with
[26:17.040 --> 26:22.000]  donald trump i know what it's like not at his level to be surrounded by wolves shoving their
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.680]  knives in you you're in the arena and all these people are up there in the stands saying how you
[26:25.680 --> 26:29.200]  how we should do this how we should do that it doesn't matter he's in the arena it makes me
[26:29.200 --> 26:33.200]  respect him you are in the arena it's like your dad commended you for getting in it but warns you
[26:33.200 --> 26:36.960]  you're in the arena can you tell folks i mean you're not just saying oh this is being censored
[26:36.960 --> 26:42.240]  oh they don't want it out oh they won't distribute it blah blah blah i mean mike judge told me and
[26:42.240 --> 26:46.000]  he's everything he's done has been a hit he made billions of dollars he told me and he's i'm allowed
[26:46.000 --> 26:52.240]  to say it when fox saw idiocracy they said this this would be a hit and by the way they had a
[26:52.240 --> 26:56.880]  contract to make him make three movies he was busy didn't want to do it they said we're not even going
[26:56.880 --> 27:00.560]  to list this or show this in theaters remember it had all this hype everybody wanted to see it
[27:00.560 --> 27:05.360]  it's a huge hit in dvd's made hundreds of billions of dollars now they killed it
[27:05.360 --> 27:08.960]  because it showed how the public was being dumbed down and wasn't a message they wanted
[27:08.960 --> 27:12.880]  that's how controlled it is so i'm kind of ranting about it i have hundreds of these stories
[27:12.880 --> 27:16.560]  folks don't understand that mike judge came on the show gave his only political interview ever
[27:16.560 --> 27:21.360]  and he said i hope i don't get audited by the irs for saying this but they basically tell people
[27:21.360 --> 27:26.480]  in hollywood you keep your mouth shut or you'll never work again and it doesn't matter if you've
[27:26.480 --> 27:32.000]  made three billion dollars like mike judge go ahead yeah no you're right uh we're running in we ran
[27:32.000 --> 27:39.280]  into that uh in hollywood sent out the screeners everybody goes who really good film not one person
[27:39.280 --> 27:45.280]  would touch it even though every one of them said this thing is going to get a lot of support not one
[27:45.280 --> 27:50.560]  studio would touch it so gary said you know what forget it we'll do it ourselves and so that's why
[27:50.560 --> 27:56.800]  we're going to open this film march 2nd in theaters in texas on texas independence day and
[27:57.520 --> 28:04.240]  it's just so important that it's us it's me it's you that come out and support this film um
[28:05.360 --> 28:11.040]  i cannot emphasize that enough that all of us rally together we become an army of one and we
[28:11.040 --> 28:16.800]  support this film and other films that will come out like it very important uh we we're on an island
[28:16.800 --> 28:23.840]  we're fighting a war i we are fighting a war so we got to stick together everyone absolutely and
[28:23.840 --> 28:28.240]  look you've got all these big tv shows movies uh you're not doing this for money emmer we talked
[28:28.240 --> 28:32.240]  behind the scenes you've got more work you could ever deal with with all the tv shows you produce
[28:32.240 --> 28:36.720]  not just walker the rest of it uh i mean you knew you would get further black mold for doing this
[28:36.720 --> 28:40.480]  but it was almost just the challenge to do it now you've done it and it's it's better than i
[28:40.480 --> 28:44.560]  thought it'd be uh with the budget i mean some parts of it look like beyond the godfather they're
[28:44.560 --> 28:50.080]  so good other parts you know are fun but better than tv i mean that's my real review but the content
[28:50.080 --> 28:56.080]  is five star i mean i i'm really honored to be involved in this yeah i i appreciate that it was uh
[28:57.680 --> 29:03.040]  you know gary just put in so much time and effort into every word that is in this film
[29:03.040 --> 29:08.000]  we we speak on the second amendment we speak on the government come to take our weapon you lay out
[29:08.000 --> 29:14.720]  the whole blueprint everything everything before this all started i i was in the dark and i'm thinking
[29:14.720 --> 29:21.040]  what on earth is gary thinking here but the more i research it then that's when i start
[29:21.040 --> 29:24.240]  figure out holy crap well that's what you said at first you were kind of ambivalent and by the
[29:24.240 --> 29:29.520]  time you were making you liked it now you love it love it i'm in i'm sold high five baby ha ha
[29:29.520 --> 29:35.680]  when we come back with mike norris there it is the first born progeny of the great king norris in
[29:35.680 --> 29:39.760]  front of us i know i know your dad's probably listening to me being goofy that's what i do though

[29:53.200 --> 30:04.560]  radio network police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called
[30:04.560 --> 30:11.680]  stingrays which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants
[30:12.800 --> 30:18.720]  the technology comes courtesy of the fbi who have forced our nation's police departments into
[30:18.720 --> 30:24.800]  signing nondisclosure agreements forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology
[30:24.800 --> 30:30.160]  needless to say this is a direct violation of our fourth amendment and they have no legal
[30:30.160 --> 30:36.240]  authority for warrantless stingray spying where we now know that police are collecting information
[30:36.240 --> 30:43.120]  on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes once again more evidence

[33:55.920 --> 34:04.720]  is descended on our entire nation hello mr president now is the time the average american
[34:04.720 --> 34:10.640]  family only has three days of food we need to talk face to face this is important so what's the
[34:10.640 --> 34:16.880]  miss disarm the population and restore order have any weapons inside your home on your personal
[34:16.880 --> 34:22.720]  you had to give the president power to arrest any american by simply accusing them of terrorism
[34:23.360 --> 34:29.520]  the vanity of nationalism will quickly fade ease but the best bangs of a new world order
[34:30.480 --> 34:35.840]  i'm just so afraid of the world that you're gonna have to grow up this is a time man woman
[34:35.840 --> 34:45.840]  younger or when folks run hide or they pull up their bootstraps when you sell your soul
[34:46.400 --> 34:56.560]  it's a one-time thing there's no going back america and it hits theaters coming up on march
[34:56.560 --> 35:01.520]  second texas independence day and we need to get around this hollywood blockade if it sells out
[35:01.520 --> 35:07.120]  the first few days in the theaters where it opens in texas that will then break the blockade just
[35:07.120 --> 35:12.480]  like we did with america 2016 and the rest of it and again i wasn't making money off america 2016
[35:12.480 --> 35:16.960]  but i helped promote it helped push it just as you did to make sure it got around the censors
[35:16.960 --> 35:21.040]  and had a big effect they of course arrested denisha susan and we talk about the censorship
[35:21.040 --> 35:24.320]  and the stuff that goes on yeah they basically told him we're doing this because of your film
[35:24.320 --> 35:28.880]  and the next film that was coming out they want to intimidate people they want to shut people down
[35:28.880 --> 35:33.760]  they sent him for psychological psychiatric evaluation for nine months after he was in prison
[35:34.320 --> 35:39.600]  over campaign issues and even the psychiatrist laughed and said this is all political persecution
[35:39.600 --> 35:44.480]  so the good news is there's good people throughout the system that know this is a fraud but they don't
[35:44.480 --> 35:52.560]  want you to see america they don't want to harden the emp shield they don't want to have this country
[35:52.560 --> 35:58.880]  be strong so on everybody to go to america uh there on facebook we're going to send the link out

[36:04.160 --> 36:10.080]  very very important that this film trailer go viral because it's about alternative media

[36:30.080 --> 36:34.960]  new genre just like your dad did from the grassroots i mean explain that your dad with his films
[36:34.960 --> 36:39.760]  grassroots to dominate hollywood for over a decade unprecedented what your dad did you guys are
[36:39.760 --> 36:44.080]  getting ready to do it again with this yeah no we're going to do the same thing he did back in
[36:44.080 --> 36:49.920]  the late 70s early 80s he'd make a movie he'd take it to a theater called four walling uh rent
[36:49.920 --> 36:54.720]  the theater and uh have people come in and see it and that's pretty much i think what the same
[36:54.720 --> 37:01.920]  thing we're going to do with this in texas i just think it's i i like it that i'm a texan i live in
[37:01.920 --> 37:07.280]  the greatest state we have in america i believe texas is the greatest state we have it's the greatest
[37:07.280 --> 37:12.240]  country within america i think and you know that's where i used to always hear that growing up and
[37:12.240 --> 37:15.680]  rolled my eyes you don't listen to your parents and grandparents but after i've been here and
[37:15.680 --> 37:20.560]  seen the difference in what old texas was absolutely it's great people yeah and i'm from
[37:20.560 --> 37:25.760]  los angeles i was born and raised in la by the grace of god i got out of there i'm a full blood
[37:25.760 --> 37:30.080]  tech but you're partially raised by steve mcqueen so he did he taught me how to ride a motor a few
[37:30.080 --> 37:35.200]  things trump been from texas yeah no but your daddy's from oklahoma which used to be part of texas
[37:35.200 --> 37:40.000]  did it really oh yeah i thought we were part of mexico you were that too have you seen the
[37:40.000 --> 37:44.560]  original texas territory let's put it up on screen it was big well all the way up to colorado
[37:44.560 --> 37:50.240]  uh we we don't learn that in school in california we just learned about their earthquakes no folks
[37:50.240 --> 37:56.000]  show them original texas map it was as almost as big as louisiana purchase wow that's crazy
[37:56.000 --> 38:01.840]  stop it keep going strong but no and and that's what's really exciting oh look at part of oklahoma
[38:01.840 --> 38:07.760]  yeah sure is well learn something every day sorry go ahead um but but that's what's uh
[38:07.760 --> 38:13.760]  really exciting is if we've got a starting point um we appreciate you guys so much uh
[38:13.760 --> 38:17.840]  info wars just how how you've support us how you were david night's in the trailer david night's
[38:17.840 --> 38:22.800]  in the trailer david night did an amazing job in in the opening it's a little opening we've got to
[38:22.800 --> 38:28.560]  just kind of give an overview of where we are in the world today and that's where our story picks
[38:28.560 --> 38:33.840]  up with you and gary going head to head i wonder if we'll see david night in future films very
[38:33.840 --> 38:43.680]  possible and the door sidekick but our our our goal ultimately is have this successful enough
[38:43.680 --> 38:49.120]  that the networks that the tv networks can't deny us doing a television series called the
[38:49.120 --> 38:59.360]  american diaries uh dropping more bombshells on folks but if people watch it they have to
[38:59.360 --> 39:03.760]  show it they have to show it and you've done that a lot with tv shows over and over again
[39:03.760 --> 39:07.280]  absolutely i i mean i'm not just walker texas ranger you yourself have rolled out a bunch of
[39:07.280 --> 39:12.160]  big tv shows yeah i've worked on you know my brother was uh the uh stunt coordinator second
[39:12.160 --> 39:18.080]  director on chase prison break so i was able to go work on these shows i work on great films
[39:18.080 --> 39:25.520]  rush hour films so i've done a lot of stuff the thing is once i did america edin that's it
[39:25.520 --> 39:33.920]  i am now that guy doing those movies and i'm all in i'm all in i uh sold my soul to god i'll
[39:33.920 --> 39:37.680]  i will tell a story about the gist of folks give another example of the censorship and i can care
[39:37.680 --> 39:43.440]  less i love it um i knew back when i was on the set of scander darkly consulting for it but also in
[39:43.440 --> 39:48.800]  it um with a great guy rick link letter who's a true you know liberal slash libertarian classical
[39:48.800 --> 39:54.720]  liberal not the modern fascist type but he runs the austin texas film societies and stuff like that
[39:54.720 --> 39:58.320]  and robert rodriguez was out there at the old airport where they have a whole you know shooting
[39:58.320 --> 40:03.840]  facility that was first when they opened that at the old airport and uh some of my films have been
[40:03.840 --> 40:09.760]  given by one of the stunt directors to rodriguez's wife at the time and she liked the films but you
[40:09.760 --> 40:13.200]  know i basically was told well but rodriguez doesn't like you blah blah blah and all the
[40:13.200 --> 40:16.960]  stuff because he wants a larican keystone all the rest of it so he's kind of in my view my
[40:16.960 --> 40:21.440]  opinion like the like a white racist which is spanish racist and he and he's shown that with
[40:21.440 --> 40:25.680]  some of the stuff he's done but you know regardless i'm against all folks being based on race stuff
[40:25.680 --> 40:30.800]  and i'm he's a very talented director so i'm not attacking him then i was given the script
[40:30.800 --> 40:34.240]  of machete and i just said here's this script it's incredibly race baiting
[40:34.720 --> 40:38.080]  my gosh and i knew it was being partially funded through the democrats and others
[40:38.080 --> 40:42.560]  i later confirmed from inside sources these met with obama with his channel tv channel
[40:42.560 --> 40:47.360]  he's launched his meant for this whole you know a class of civilizations garbage george soros funding
[40:47.360 --> 40:51.920]  black lives matter so i'm for reforming the police problems but i'm not for just overthrowing the
[40:51.920 --> 40:56.560]  government you know having some communist takeover which your film kind of covers well doesn't kind
[40:56.560 --> 41:01.920]  of cover it does and then rodriguez comes out in the austin america statesman and in variety and
[41:01.920 --> 41:06.400]  says alex jones is a liar that is not the script well i knew it was it was directly from high
[41:06.400 --> 41:13.040]  level folks inside yeah then the film came out and it was word for word it was the script and
[41:14.320 --> 41:18.000]  perry already wanted to cut some of the film incentives in texas because they weren't they
[41:18.000 --> 41:21.280]  were being selectively given they wouldn't give them the conservative groups libertarian groups
[41:21.280 --> 41:24.880]  they wouldn't give them to a group that was making a phone about weiko that that was even a liberal
[41:24.880 --> 41:31.360]  group uh that was against it and so i said it's wrong to not give the film incentives to everybody
[41:31.360 --> 41:36.720]  you're making a film whether it goes to dvd whatever it says in the law you you get the
[41:36.720 --> 41:42.160]  tax incentive i want no taxes on film i want to be the new hollywood that's what i said they spun
[41:42.160 --> 41:47.120]  that whole thing perry then basically used it to blame me and i'm not attacking perry but it happened
[41:47.120 --> 41:52.640]  that that's why they removed film incentives in texas and then ronriguez with the entire
[41:52.640 --> 41:58.000]  business associations in in austin as if it hurt me we can't get somebody from austin to change a
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.840]  light bulb in here well that was better we were gonna have locals build our set we just hired the
[42:01.840 --> 42:06.320]  folks that built the fox news studios out of new york oh you heard us so bad you know we just hired
[42:06.320 --> 42:11.200]  folks from outside i mean big deal great but then we hire folks out of dalis but i think people as
[42:11.200 --> 42:16.000]  far away as dalis working here and they go i just got a call from rodriguez i'll never work again if
[42:16.000 --> 42:21.040]  i work with you and that's how hollywood works explain that to people yeah no that that's exactly
[42:21.040 --> 42:26.720]  how it is um you know people do get blackballed out of hollywood but i mean down to the point
[42:26.720 --> 42:32.640]  where i can't even get crew in here yeah no yeah i i get it there and you know what they uh
[42:32.640 --> 42:37.840]  they've got their hands inside the the unions and everything well shows how their thugs trying
[42:37.840 --> 42:42.080]  to run what we do i'm not in the hollywood i'm gonna be got a media operation yeah and that's
[42:42.080 --> 42:49.440]  just like us that's just like us we make movies we make movies um yeah it's tough and and i don't
[42:49.440 --> 42:53.840]  know what's going on down in osu with rodriguez but i'm not trying to get you into that i'm just
[42:53.840 --> 42:57.200]  i'm just showing you inside baseball that i've experienced yeah talk about the type of stuff
[42:57.200 --> 43:02.400]  hollywood does the spiritual darkness you've talked about uh why you say it's a satanic conspiracy
[43:02.400 --> 43:06.720]  because i agree at the end of the day these people do stuff in power that isn't even good for them
[43:06.720 --> 43:11.920]  and their families or their bottom line but they have a mission they're bound together by that mystery
[43:11.920 --> 43:20.560]  of evil yeah i yeah i think the world the whole world and the elites are demonic i i really do
[43:20.560 --> 43:27.760]  i believe they have sold their soul to the devil for power for money and they want chaos they need
[43:27.760 --> 43:34.720]  chaos to take over it says in the movie um you know all america needs is a little chaos for us to
[43:34.720 --> 43:40.880]  take over and it shows the uan and globalist he's a soros character yep mentally uh creating with
[43:40.880 --> 43:46.560]  the the destabilization yeah absolutely and and it's happening it's all happening right in front
[43:46.560 --> 43:51.120]  of us right now all you gotta do is turn on the tv and i'm done i'm done turning on the tv because
[43:51.120 --> 43:55.680]  all they're telling me is lies so this is where i'm getting my information i'm getting my information
[43:55.680 --> 44:02.080]  from you from bright bright from drudge that's where we need to people really need to go out
[44:02.080 --> 44:06.800]  and start studying well i gotta say bright mart was always really good but they just do break a lot
[44:06.800 --> 44:12.480]  of hardcore news so does so does a daily caller i mean they they are really exposing so is info
[44:12.480 --> 44:17.040]  wars but people say man why do you promote your competition it's not competition i mean we're
[44:17.040 --> 44:20.880]  going to lose everything if we don't turn this around folks no you're a hundred percent right
[44:20.880 --> 44:25.760]  and we're losing every we're losing right now but we will win i we are going to win the world
[44:25.760 --> 44:30.400]  not daily is excellent yeah we're not daily yeah but we're going to win it's getting and
[44:30.400 --> 44:37.520]  i mean what people got to understand this is not this isn't a joke this is going to be horrible
[44:37.520 --> 44:41.920]  when all the supreme court justice i can't name him came to drudge and said we're gonna they're
[44:41.920 --> 44:47.040]  going to start trying to shut the media down next year yeah it's going to be horrible and once they
[44:47.040 --> 44:52.480]  start trying to really take away our guns that's when it it's really going to fall apart i'm not
[44:52.480 --> 44:57.440]  giving up mine and they know that that will trigger the civil war which is the ultimate
[44:57.440 --> 45:02.080]  false flag because if they've wargamed it and know it'll start a war it's unconstitutional
[45:02.080 --> 45:06.640]  it'll cause higher crime it's evil and they go ahead and do it just like the destabilized syria
[45:06.640 --> 45:11.040]  or ukraine is are the elites really gonna let george soros and hillary clinton and others
[45:11.040 --> 45:15.760]  and obama really try to run that here i mean a few people and look we have general flin always
[45:15.760 --> 45:21.200]  the top generals coming out saying our government runs al-qaeda and isis it's wrong it was willful
[45:21.200 --> 45:26.720]  it's evil it needs to be investigated that is almost valkyrie level world war two the german
[45:26.720 --> 45:31.600]  military going after hitler that's one inch away from that next move yeah oh imagine a chuck
[45:31.600 --> 45:36.800]  norris movie with a hundred million dollar budget with him as a colonel leading a command group
[45:36.800 --> 45:43.520]  kicking a un takeover army uh basically out of dc or something uh that would be the movie uh
[45:43.520 --> 45:49.840]  oh yeah that that that would be cool that would actually um yeah but it really goes back we are
[45:49.840 --> 45:55.760]  all in a fight and we're on our side we're the good guys here and your listeners and your viewers

[46:48.720 --> 46:53.840]  the first two delta forces the film company cannon wanted to do yeah there's a little more
[46:53.840 --> 46:58.320]  life in this let's go do it so i got a phone call well we want to make these delta force movies but

[47:06.640 --> 47:10.960]  force three and four let's see you then by the way not only were you you know good buddies and your
[47:10.960 --> 47:15.600]  dad of course with uh steve mcqueen who i guess introduced your dad into movies and the rest was
[47:15.600 --> 47:20.880]  history uh but your dad was the real deal i mean i remember talking to uh to joe rogan you know who's
[47:20.880 --> 47:25.600]  an accomplice UFC guy and won some national stuff in taekwondo as well yeah i was like well who you
[47:25.600 --> 47:30.640]  know like who's your idol and he goes well i like check norris and this is like met him like 16 17
[47:30.640 --> 47:34.000]  years ago here in awesome we've been good friends since then and i said why and he goes well he's
[47:34.000 --> 47:37.840]  like the american deal he goes he won all those championships for real against guys a lot bigger
[47:37.840 --> 47:42.400]  that was all real he could continue to win over and over again and he goes man you get hurt doing
[47:42.400 --> 47:46.400]  that just a couple times because you know that was contact sport obviously you know all about it
[47:46.400 --> 47:51.280]  and the fact that then he could go on and start his own hollywood thing from the grassroots i mean
[47:51.280 --> 47:55.520]  your dad was a mavericks maverick when the stuff he's done and he's still a mavericks maverick with
[47:55.520 --> 48:01.920]  what he's going to do in the future yeah absolutely i you know it's really a blessing to
[48:03.360 --> 48:10.320]  really have a father that um first off he loved us well joe i forgot joe just interrupts i'm so
[48:10.320 --> 48:15.120]  horrible yeah i forgot joe said he thought your dad would have been a ufc champion if he'd have been
[48:15.120 --> 48:20.800]  you know at that age now when that was going on sorry go ahead i could have been my my dad was
[48:20.800 --> 48:26.160]  smarter than any other fighter out there he was not the most physical he was not the fastest meanest
[48:26.160 --> 48:31.360]  anything but he was the smartest and if he ever did get beat it only happened once because he would
[48:31.360 --> 48:35.680]  learn his lesson come back and beat that opponent you said your dad loved you interrupted yeah no
[48:35.680 --> 48:42.720]  you know what my dad in our you know during high school he wouldn't make movies during football
[48:42.720 --> 48:49.680]  season he'd come to every football game every friday night light um so he scheduled his life
[48:49.680 --> 48:56.720]  around his kids um and i hope he i hope he still sees it like that because he's got two younger
[48:56.720 --> 49:05.600]  kids now with uh jena and they're 14 15 years old and in it's important that my dad knows that
[49:05.600 --> 49:10.080]  this isn't his second chance he did great the first time and he's going to do great again with
[49:10.080 --> 49:17.360]  his new kids but it was so special to be able to you know see him kind of his fame get a little
[49:17.360 --> 49:21.280]  higher and then he'd still show up at all the football games i'd run up and give him a kiss

[59:56.320 --> 1:00:09.520]  we are on the march the empire is on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:00:15.280 --> 1:00:19.600]  and i recognize that a great many folks in the in the media would would would prefer
[1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:27.040]  uh... that that anyone running for president engage in an ongoing as an ongoing theater critic
[1:00:28.160 --> 1:00:33.200]  criticizing the proposals of others i do not agree with his proposal i do not think it is the
[1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:39.520]  right solution and the right solution i believe is the legislation that i've introduced legislation
[1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:46.560]  that would impose a three year moratorium on the refugees coming from countries where isis
[1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:53.040]  or al-qaeda control a substantial amount of territory this is legislation that is targeted
[1:00:53.040 --> 1:01:00.080]  directly to the problem and the reason is simple we have been told by the fb i they cannot vet these
[1:01:00.080 --> 1:01:05.920]  refugees the second piece of legislation governor abit mentioned is legislation that i filed today
[1:01:05.920 --> 1:01:12.080]  that will protect the authority of the states and the authority of governors to keep their citizens
[1:01:12.080 --> 1:01:17.920]  safe and it would say that in the event the president wants to send refugees to a particular
[1:01:17.920 --> 1:01:24.800]  state that a governor has the ability to opt out to conclude that the federal government has not
[1:01:24.800 --> 1:01:30.080]  done a sufficient job insuring that the safety and security of the citizens of the state will be
[1:01:30.080 --> 1:01:34.720]  protected and then the third piece of legislation that i have tried to bring up in recent weeks
[1:01:34.720 --> 1:01:41.520]  and the democrats have blocked is the expatriate terrorist act which provides that if an american
[1:01:41.520 --> 1:01:48.160]  goes and travels abroad and joins isis and takes up arms and wages jihad against the united states
[1:01:48.160 --> 1:01:53.360]  that he or she forfeits their u.s. citizenship that's a good idea all of these are reasonable
[1:01:53.360 --> 1:02:01.040]  common-sense steps yep to keep america safe at senator ted cruse very presidential i mean he
[1:02:01.040 --> 1:02:05.600]  probably is the smartest of all candidates on the republican side other than trump when it comes to
[1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:11.600]  business and trump knows people like stuff said kind of at a street level trump says it's what he's
[1:02:11.600 --> 1:02:19.280]  got street smarts cruse is very statesmanly very cerebral and what he's saying is an accurate
[1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:25.520]  basic plan i mean it's the bare minimum you should do when 25 of the people in a poll
[1:02:25.520 --> 1:02:32.480]  say that they support suicide bombers or they support isis that's because they admit between
[1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:39.840]  75 and 80 plus percent depending on which numbers come out from inner poll the eu you name it are
[1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:49.680]  not syrians they came to take over land just like the saudi arabians did one time before
[1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:54.160]  they came in and took over syria and got kicked back out there's a movie about it it's called
[1:02:54.160 --> 1:03:03.600]  laurence of arabia and it's not their country and they're they're taking it they never had any
[1:03:03.600 --> 1:03:08.480]  history up there they have no reason to be there they're there and then now they're going to come
[1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:15.520]  here and they are incompatible to live anywhere i mean saudi arabia is a freak zone of craziness
[1:03:15.520 --> 1:03:18.400]  from all the military and family i've talked to that have worked for different companies
[1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:21.920]  been over there i mean they catch you with the bible on the street folks you're going to be in
[1:03:21.920 --> 1:03:28.160]  prison for life lucky they don't chop your head off and all they do is peck at each other to make
[1:03:28.160 --> 1:03:32.560]  the others more radical that's what cults do they just get more and more extreme more and more
[1:03:32.560 --> 1:03:40.800]  whacked out more and more weird and i for one am completely sick of it i do not have islamophobia
[1:03:40.800 --> 1:03:49.200]  i have well hobbyist saudi arabia phobia i have cult phobia and who's the other group acts like
[1:03:49.200 --> 1:03:55.280]  a cult that i can see that i am just as disgusted by because they are so freakish they are so weird
[1:03:56.080 --> 1:03:59.360]  and they're teamed up with the jihadis with the wahhabist jihadis
[1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:04.880]  and that is the politically correct left
[1:04:07.680 --> 1:04:13.520]  that you cannot make up how serious their war on words their war on logic their war on discussion
[1:04:13.520 --> 1:04:19.600]  their war on free speech their war on creativity their war on beauty their war on arithmetic
[1:04:19.600 --> 1:04:25.280]  their war on literature their war on culture their their their war on common sense their
[1:04:25.280 --> 1:04:33.440]  war on logic their war on beauty their war on men their war on women their war on basic human
[1:04:33.440 --> 1:04:40.560]  systems students at pennsylvania college went lynch hall renamed because of the word lynch
[1:04:40.560 --> 1:04:47.200]  i'm gonna cover this and take your phone calls when we come back folks they know exactly what
[1:04:47.200 --> 1:04:53.440]  they're doing when they say ban the irish word lynch that has nothing to do with hanging black
[1:04:53.440 --> 1:05:03.840]  people well it looks like the justice department wants to ban more americans from owning guns
[1:05:03.840 --> 1:05:10.720]  that's right president brock who's saying obama is proposing new firearm regulations that will revoke
[1:05:10.720 --> 1:05:16.800]  gun rights from those the government declares to be mentally unfit and that's a scary thought
[1:05:16.800 --> 1:05:23.920]  considering the fact that the official diagnostic system for mental disorders in the us the dsm five
[1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:30.320]  is so broad that almost every form of human behavior can be diagnosed as some type of mental
[1:05:30.320 --> 1:05:36.800]  illness for example in 2012 the department of veteran affairs sent out letters to us military
[1:05:36.800 --> 1:05:42.720]  veterans to inform them that their competence levels were under review if the federal government
[1:05:42.720 --> 1:05:47.840]  rated them incompetent they would be prohibited from purchasing possessing receiving or
[1:05:47.840 --> 1:05:54.400]  transporting a firearm or even ammo for more details on this story plus all today's breaking news

[1:09:02.320 --> 1:09:07.760]  advisor to nine presidents and who's been involved in elections here in all over the world and one
[1:09:07.760 --> 1:09:13.440]  of trump's top advisors joining us for an hour and a half to talk all things planet trump and
[1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:24.720]  election 2016 then leon macadoo will be hosting the fourth hour today now we've had kareem abdul jabbar
[1:09:24.720 --> 1:09:30.400]  we've had senator lindsay graham we've had countless other republican candidates jeb bush
[1:09:31.920 --> 1:09:38.960]  people like rick ross the fake rick ross come out and well rick ross had killed don
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:43.680]  trump says he wants him to be murdered um and kareem abdul jabbar claims that he's helping isis
[1:09:43.680 --> 1:09:47.920]  he's the isis candidate when he actually called for bombing their oil that they're trying to sell
[1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:52.160]  and actually agree with putin and others something the other candidates didn't do
[1:09:53.680 --> 1:09:59.200]  so donald trump is right on about like i said about 95 percent of his views and topics i disagree
[1:09:59.200 --> 1:10:03.440]  with him on a few things like the internet and you know restricting it so isis doesn't get it you
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:09.280]  just can't do that so so there are some problems with trump but compared to a hillary clinton
[1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:11.840]  or compared to a lindsay graham or compared to a
[1:10:14.240 --> 1:10:22.640]  you know socialist senator from connecticut it is complete and total absolute night and day
[1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:29.440]  and before we go to the calls though the problem we're dealing with as the pure research shows the
[1:10:29.440 --> 1:10:36.080]  middle class is disappearing at the fastest rate ever that the workforce is set to shrink two million
[1:10:36.080 --> 1:10:41.680]  people the congressional budget office is saying just from the first year of full implementation
[1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:46.960]  of obama care we're only 21 days out from that nightmare the fines all the rest of it
[1:10:46.960 --> 1:10:54.480]  morgan stanley begins layoffs and credit division while all this is going on the fbi admits they're
[1:10:54.480 --> 1:10:59.120]  not vetting any of these refugees a large portion admit they want to be terrorist they're attacking
[1:10:59.120 --> 1:11:04.240]  europe on a basically weekly basis we're getting attacked they try to say all these attacks aren't
[1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:12.640]  attacks whether it's fort hud or what happened last wednesday eight days ago and in the midst of this
[1:11:12.640 --> 1:11:19.440]  though they want thomas jefferson's statues taken down all over the country because he tried to ban
[1:11:19.440 --> 1:11:23.760]  slavery in the declaration of independence but it was removed that's how ignorant they are and they
[1:11:23.760 --> 1:11:32.080]  go but but he he had slaves that he was trying to change the law to free the time he was in it's
[1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:37.440]  like it's like saying schindler went along with the nazis yeah as he tried to save jews he had to
[1:11:37.440 --> 1:11:42.080]  or they'd kill him right there on the spot i mean there's just no understanding of the time people
[1:11:42.080 --> 1:11:50.240]  are in but you see things like seattle where the official city not some idiot students but the official
[1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:57.600]  city says don't bring brown bags to to to any city function and don't say that a city function brown
[1:11:57.600 --> 1:12:03.360]  bag it because brown saying the word brown might hurt somebody's feeling or seeing brown now they
[1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:08.880]  admitted no one ever claimed it was racist no no they they have to attach racial meaning or religious
[1:12:08.880 --> 1:12:15.280]  bigotry or something in fighting to all words in all language so when they want to they can
[1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:23.600]  to they can selectively demonize your speech and disqualify it's a war on words you know george
[1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:30.000]  arwell said eric blair writer for the bbc propagandist for british intelligence winston smith is an
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:33.920]  allegory of himself he admitted that before he died he died a year after he published 1984
[1:12:36.160 --> 1:12:44.080]  but 1949 it's 1948 reverse ladies and gentlemen of what it would be of the thabian socialist
[1:12:44.080 --> 1:12:48.480]  liberals took over what the world would look like and you notice it's looking more and more like that
[1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:53.520]  because he was in there amongst them and he wrote essays admitting it
[1:12:55.520 --> 1:12:59.280]  he didn't like radical right wingers he'd been a leftist his whole life fought in the
[1:13:00.480 --> 1:13:01.600]  spanish civil war
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:08.160]  then a member of the secret police before that in india that's what made him a leftist
[1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:15.040]  was the abuse of indians in india but but i digress he said the the goal will be
[1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:19.440]  by the thabian socialist to reduce language down to such a level that you cannot communicate
[1:13:19.440 --> 1:13:23.200]  with someone and have them even understand how they've been lied to and they'll have double
[1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:27.440]  think where they hold two opposite thoughts in their mind at the same time and believe each one
[1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:34.960]  as valid as the other that's what they're indoctrinating us with is like this mental illness
[1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:42.720]  this this mass Stockholm syndrome and so sitting back looking at all of this
[1:13:46.400 --> 1:13:51.520]  they have to expand it out always more and more so the real racism of targeting blacks with
[1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:55.760]  Planned Parenthood isn't looked at or targeting hispanics with garter still shots isn't looked at
[1:13:55.760 --> 1:13:59.360]  no no you just got to then say well if you don't have totally open borders and pay for
[1:13:59.360 --> 1:14:05.760]  everything free you're a racist or if donald trump goes to a jewish group and says you know
[1:14:05.760 --> 1:14:09.840]  jews are really known for being smart hardworking folks it's good to be here with such good people
[1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:16.160]  oh it's racist to attribute something to a racial or religious group no everybody said
[1:14:16.160 --> 1:14:22.000]  look at the japanese crime went down during the tsunami and during the earthquakes when things got
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:29.600]  tough almost no crime wow what amazing people that's not anti japanese see they're attacking
[1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:36.160]  your ability to discriminate see some discrimination is obviously wrong if it's based on on real
[1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:40.240]  issues but if it's based on i've been to that restaurant twice and got food poisoning both
[1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:45.520]  times it's not racist or discriminatory or whatever to discriminate and say i like the
[1:14:45.520 --> 1:14:50.640]  hamburgers at that place i like this ketchup i like this brand of car i like women that look
[1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:56.560]  like this and act like this it's what you like they're saying you can't have your own opinions
[1:14:56.560 --> 1:15:03.760]  or be a free conscious individual that is cult like isn't it by design so now students at
[1:15:03.760 --> 1:15:09.680]  pennsylvania school want lynch hall this is associated press this isn't in full wars dot com
[1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:16.480]  students at pennsylvania school want lynch haul rename because the word lynch
[1:15:16.480 --> 1:15:27.120]  now i went and looked it up lynch means mariner or water in the irish gaelic and it basically
[1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:31.440]  means the same thing in the nordic lynch there's also a nordic lynch because all the groups are
[1:15:31.440 --> 1:15:35.520]  really related to each other which shows how stupid it is the british empire could play
[1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:40.400]  different groups off against each other it's totally moronic but another side issue divide and
[1:15:40.400 --> 1:15:48.880]  conquer they call it the great game uh this is from ancestry dot com irish lynch anglicized from
[1:15:48.880 --> 1:15:59.520]  gaelic long shine a personal name meaning mariner from longship or viking basically okay men in
[1:15:59.520 --> 1:16:12.560]  long boats let's continue that settled ireland the etymology this is from encyclopedia the origins
[1:16:12.560 --> 1:16:16.880]  of the word lynch are obscure but likely originate from the american evolution the term originates from
[1:16:16.880 --> 1:16:24.800]  the phrase lynch law passed to stop people lynching punishment without trial so see the word lynch is
[1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:30.240]  good meaning stop doing it two americans during this era are generally credit with the phrase
[1:16:30.240 --> 1:16:35.680]  charles lynch and william lynch both lived in virginia in the 1918 1780s trying to go too fast
[1:16:35.680 --> 1:16:38.960]  here go and go to calls i'm gonna slow down and cover this charles lynch
[1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:44.560]  and then it just goes over the fact that it was a case of lynching
[1:16:47.120 --> 1:16:53.040]  and by the way none of a black person but this is how emotional it is you hear a nordic or an irish
[1:16:53.040 --> 1:16:59.760]  gaelic name that means mariner or boatman and then you want it banned because all you know
[1:16:59.760 --> 1:17:05.120]  is the word lynch is associated with hanging black people when really it was two white men
[1:17:05.120 --> 1:17:12.640]  hanging a member of their family who were named lynch but see for them it's a power thing to
[1:17:12.640 --> 1:17:21.200]  take language away to take people's rights away to have a name to demand history be overwritten
[1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:28.560]  this is the essence of 1984 changing history i mean so what if it was a racist weirdo that
[1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:33.600]  founded your college you run it now it's run by your people it's a building it's a colony it's
[1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:38.080]  a system it's where you're supposed to learn you learn how to end fight not not how to get a job
[1:17:38.080 --> 1:17:44.800]  not how to be normal it'd be like saying of a moray eel had lived in a hole in coral 20 years
[1:17:44.800 --> 1:17:51.120]  before and now a grouper lives in it does the grouper say moray eels eat baby groupers so this
[1:17:51.120 --> 1:17:57.040]  was a racist hole so i'm not going to live in this a moray eels hole because he doesn't even care
[1:17:57.040 --> 1:18:00.800]  that a moray eel lived there 20 years before he doesn't even know it it's a good hole
[1:18:03.040 --> 1:18:08.160]  oh change it but it wasn't a racist it wasn't named after a lynch mom it was named over somebody
[1:18:08.160 --> 1:18:13.840]  named lynch and they say well the word lynch could draw up frightening connotations we're scared by
[1:18:13.840 --> 1:18:19.920]  the word so get rid of it i mean you talk about idiots instead of the fun if somebody said this
[1:18:19.920 --> 1:18:25.760]  of going and looking it up oh it means boatman it means sailor it means if somebody in a navy
[1:18:28.160 --> 1:18:32.160]  students at a small pencil vena college are demanding that they're doing a walkout
[1:18:32.960 --> 1:18:37.760]  and laying on the sidewalk the administrators rename a building called lynch memorial hall
[1:18:37.760 --> 1:18:42.880]  because of the racial overturns of the word lynch oh there's overtones and brown bag too
[1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:48.640]  the building is named it required a lynch who was president of lebanon valley college until 1950
[1:18:51.360 --> 1:18:56.240]  and they said they want it renamed after his first name and middle initial because the word
[1:18:58.240 --> 1:19:03.520]  recalls the public executions of black men by white mobs in the 18 and 19 hundreds
[1:19:04.880 --> 1:19:08.400]  it was included on a list of demands that students presented at the school on friday
[1:19:08.400 --> 1:19:14.080]  i mean you talk about a group of ignorant morons and by the way if any of the professors dare educate
[1:19:14.080 --> 1:19:20.000]  them and say hey it's an irish name it's a nordic name it has nothing to do with any of this it
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:26.560]  means sailor uh this guy is just irish you know he helped get this building built he gave the money
[1:19:26.560 --> 1:19:32.400]  for it so you can be in it they just go no we the lynch word scares us we want it banned
[1:19:32.400 --> 1:19:40.160]  think about that these people aren't going to be able to get jobs or have a life they're
[1:19:40.160 --> 1:19:44.880]  going to be gibbering mentally ill people when they come out of college the ones that mind of
[1:19:44.880 --> 1:19:50.400]  this they just know how to just see shadows and phantoms everywhere while their basic freedoms
[1:19:50.400 --> 1:19:55.840]  are being removed collectively regardless of race color creed religion against them all

[1:24:16.240 --> 1:24:26.560]  will it make it easier on your mouth but you got donald trump to blame you got someone to blame
[1:24:26.560 --> 1:24:31.280]  that's right they say he is behind isis one that's how dumb they think you are that's the new
[1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:38.800]  talking point by the republicans the democrats all of hillary clinton that creature lenzie
[1:24:38.800 --> 1:24:46.720]  graham john mccain they're all out there saying that donald trump is helping isis and then giving
[1:24:46.720 --> 1:24:52.000]  no intellectual facts no donald trump's trying to keep isis out of this country and when there's
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:58.160]  a more terror attacks and donald trump points out it's another person got in got into this country
[1:24:58.160 --> 1:25:04.480]  on a phony visa with phony info will he get rewarded with people's support probably not
[1:25:04.480 --> 1:25:08.800]  because the ones that already support him know what's going on the ones that don't
[1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:14.560]  they don't care how much evidence there is how much common sense there is they're the kind of people
[1:25:14.560 --> 1:25:20.640]  that want to change the name of lynch hall at a college because the last guy's name is lynch
[1:25:21.200 --> 1:25:27.040]  and they associate that with someone being hung or killed extra judicially meanwhile
[1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:33.760]  obama wants to lynch all gun owners extra judicially i just thought of that i use fancy terms
[1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:40.400]  like extra judicial banning your flight banning your guns banning your travel the blood of tyranny
[1:25:40.400 --> 1:25:48.240]  the oxygen of tyranny the atmosphere on which its wings flap and oh we're gonna just put you
[1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:54.080]  on a fly list for no reason and then you can't have a gun a no-gun list a lynch mob on the
[1:25:54.080 --> 1:26:00.320]  second amendment that's what it is an extrajudicial magic lynch mob in the unelected government
[1:26:00.320 --> 1:26:04.640]  like the india says they'll grab you they'll interrogate you they'll torture you they'll
[1:26:04.640 --> 1:26:10.000]  kill you even us citizens and you don't have a right to even tell your family they have you
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:16.320]  before they kill you and they can use torture against you a classic torture lynch mob but
[1:26:16.320 --> 1:26:23.280]  because there's a real lynching going on no one seems to care because the word is so scary
[1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:30.000]  from the name it comes from in the name of the law ignorance on top of ignorance on top of moronic
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:37.200]  idiocy but you talk to these university students i guarantee you they'll get all mad and go trigger
[1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:42.720]  trigger get back you're being aggressive you're being hateful get back get back i ran into some

[1:33:17.120 --> 1:33:21.680]  so a university in pennsylvania the associated press is reporting with a straight face
[1:33:21.680 --> 1:33:29.040]  the students have walked out uh they are doing these die-ins where they lay on the ground
[1:33:29.680 --> 1:33:40.240]  until the library hall at lebanon valley college removes the name lynch memorial hall
[1:33:42.400 --> 1:33:47.760]  not because the guy was involved in lynching anybody not because lynch is an irish name
[1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:54.320]  not because it means boatman or mariner or seaman no because they're scared of the word lynch
[1:33:54.960 --> 1:33:59.200]  and then david night just walked in during the break and he goes alex who else is named lynch
[1:33:59.840 --> 1:34:05.520]  in the administration and i went the attorney general i hadn't even thought of that how rich is
[1:34:05.520 --> 1:34:11.760]  that that obama wants to extra judicially lynch the second amendment and put you on a no-gun buy list
[1:34:12.720 --> 1:34:17.200]  on this phantom terror database when they actually won't screen the people coming in who are
[1:34:17.200 --> 1:34:24.240]  terrorists and then the attorney general is named loretta lynch then we should call for her to
[1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:30.960]  change her name i feel threatened i feel upset by it maybe ap should write a real article about
[1:34:30.960 --> 1:34:36.720]  that alex jones maybe we should start a white house petition get thousands to sign it that the
[1:34:36.720 --> 1:34:43.280]  attorney general changed her name or just be loretta l because it scares me they want the
[1:34:43.280 --> 1:34:49.680]  study hall to be renamed his first name and his second initial because it's so frightening
[1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:56.800]  they just put it on screen folks loretta lynch oh my gosh lynch get it off of there who put that
[1:34:56.800 --> 1:35:01.680]  on there i'm writing you up or firing you who in the tv control room put up the word lynch
[1:35:02.400 --> 1:35:08.560]  the trigger for me it's not a trigger the middle class is imploding and uh even the congressional
[1:35:08.560 --> 1:35:13.920]  budget office admits obama care is going to put two million people out of work next year and there's
[1:35:13.920 --> 1:35:19.840]  huge fines it was written by foreign insurance companies to screw us over her name is lynch folks
[1:35:19.840 --> 1:35:25.360]  i'm having heart palpitations right now i'm so scared please save me obama but wait a minute

[1:36:01.680 --> 1:36:08.240]  marr to the discovery channel discussing planet trump that he's an expert in because he's known
[1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:15.200]  trump since the 1980s and let me give you roger stone's bio just so you know who he is in case you
[1:36:15.200 --> 1:36:19.440]  don't roger stone's a veteran of non-republican presidential campaigns serving richard nixon
[1:36:19.440 --> 1:36:25.760]  ronald reagan senator bob dole to his subsequent regret both george bush 41 and 43 stones in
[1:36:25.760 --> 1:36:30.800]  new york times bestselling author of the men who killed kennedy or the man who killed kennedy
[1:36:30.800 --> 1:36:37.280]  the case against lbj exposing the plot led by lbj that includes the cia the mob in big texas oil
[1:36:37.280 --> 1:36:43.760]  that murdered john kennedy now in paperback the book is sold over 100 000 copies i think it's a
[1:36:43.760 --> 1:36:49.200]  lot more than that in august roger stone resigned from donald trump's campaign to release his
[1:36:49.200 --> 1:36:54.800]  groundbreaking book the clinton's war on women which is the definitive expose of the corruption
[1:36:54.800 --> 1:37:00.880]  immorality criminal record of bill clinton and hillary and chelsea clinton last week info wars
[1:37:00.880 --> 1:37:05.360]  had donald trump on the broadcast and donald trump called him a patriot in a tough cookie
[1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:12.320]  and here is what others have had to say roger stone's next book jeb and the bush crime family
[1:37:12.320 --> 1:37:18.160]  rips the veil off the whitewash that has protected the bush crime syndicate it's a story of privilege
[1:37:18.160 --> 1:37:23.680]  elitism oil money assassination sex ambition corruption and power and i'll tell you if you
[1:37:23.680 --> 1:37:29.120]  can find his book on a few online sites and you can find it at bookstores you better because
[1:37:29.120 --> 1:37:35.200]  they're reprinting it now it's sold out i've tried to buy 5 000 from sky horse we have sold
[1:37:35.200 --> 1:37:39.680]  his books before it's like wait i know this guy read his books wait you know it's like wow once
[1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:44.560]  he was in studio with us i knew he was but not how prominent and he wasn't how much he'd been involved
[1:37:44.560 --> 1:37:50.400]  in so he'll definitely be a staple of the show from now on because on elections on third world on
[1:37:50.400 --> 1:37:55.520]  uh presidents uh you know on reagan i mean he knows so much about these guys he worked for
[1:37:56.080 --> 1:38:02.800]  but what's exciting is he's known trump for 30 something years and again was his exploratory
[1:38:02.800 --> 1:38:07.840]  uh head when he was thinking about running four or five years ago and so he can really tell you
[1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:13.360]  about donald trump and what really makes donald trump tick and all these big scandals that are
[1:38:13.360 --> 1:38:19.840]  happening and the rest of it but uh yes if you can get the clinton's war on women it is a hot book
[1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:24.560]  sold out many places uh and we're trying to get an emergency printing done right now so we get more
[1:38:25.120 --> 1:38:29.120]  before christmas but but that is the bottom line
[1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:38.080]  now continuing ladies and gentlemen uh with this info i could sit here all day and bring up
[1:38:38.080 --> 1:38:42.720]  questions and comments for mr stone uh whether he wants to get into the book first whether he
[1:38:42.720 --> 1:38:47.760]  wants to get into the interview last week uh with trump that he helped set up uh and the inside
[1:38:47.760 --> 1:38:54.000]  baseball there or whether he wants to dive them the current attacks on trump let's let him decide
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:58.960]  what we get into first uh mr stone thanks for coming on with us alex thanks once again for
[1:38:58.960 --> 1:39:05.600]  having me you bet where do you want to go first let's talk about uh the media savagery of donald
[1:39:05.600 --> 1:39:12.000]  j trump i must tell you not since i saw richard nixon my mentor the man who gave me my start in
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:18.400]  politics uh under siege in 1974 while the mass media went out of their way to try to destroy him
[1:39:18.400 --> 1:39:25.600]  and drive him from public life have i seen an onslaught like this donald trump proposed a temporary
[1:39:25.600 --> 1:39:33.520]  ban on immigrant from muslim from muslim countries until such time as us representatives could get
[1:39:33.520 --> 1:39:39.440]  a handle on who who wanted to come here and the national media as you know has completely
[1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:45.520]  bastardized that they have truncated his comments to make it appear that he called for a permanent
[1:39:45.520 --> 1:39:51.280]  ban of all muslims for all time and then they launched themselves in this long discussion
[1:39:51.280 --> 1:39:57.440]  of whether that would be unconstitutional when in fact that's not what trump proposed at all he
[1:39:57.440 --> 1:40:02.880]  put forward a common sense proposal which the president of the united states clearly has the
[1:40:02.880 --> 1:40:11.040]  authority to do to freeze muslim immigration temporarily until we can set up some kind of
[1:40:11.040 --> 1:40:19.040]  screening process to vet those who would like to come here and that is what he said they took
[1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:22.640]  it out of context to just say ban all muslims and now they have all these people saying kill
[1:40:22.640 --> 1:40:27.600]  him rick ross says he wants to murder him uh the fake rick ross rapper uh it's the cause
[1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:33.440]  celeb thing to do to pile on lindsey grand hillary clinton saying he is helping isis when
[1:40:33.440 --> 1:40:38.960]  he's doing exactly what russia is doing to take out isis before russia even bombed their oil
[1:40:38.960 --> 1:40:42.880]  they're selling that they've stolen uh he said do that i mean he's been proven right on so many
[1:40:42.880 --> 1:40:48.480]  fronts yeah you know what this is of course is part and parcel the fact that he scares the
[1:40:48.480 --> 1:40:56.720]  political class to death the lobbyists the consultant class the special interests the
[1:40:56.720 --> 1:41:04.480]  billionaires paul singer the coke brothers uh uh steve schwarzman and others uh because
[1:41:04.480 --> 1:41:10.880]  you would not have business as usual in washington if trump became president good god a president
[1:41:10.880 --> 1:41:16.560]  who actually worked for the american people who couldn't be bought and sold um the other thing
[1:41:16.560 --> 1:41:24.480]  i found really laughable yesterday alex was charged by jeb bush of all people that trump was in league
[1:41:24.480 --> 1:41:31.920]  with bill and hillary clinton uh that is i can tell you having known trump for almost 40 years
[1:41:31.920 --> 1:41:38.160]  that is laughable he is one of the most competitive people in the country he is running for president
[1:41:38.160 --> 1:41:44.960]  because he wants to save this country donald trump would never be a straw man for someone else
[1:41:44.960 --> 1:41:52.160]  anyone else uh and frankly he's the only guy in the country the only guy in this race who has legal
[1:41:52.160 --> 1:41:58.400]  standing to bring a lawsuit against the clinton foundation because they defrauded him he made a
[1:41:58.400 --> 1:42:04.000]  modest contribution thinking he was giving to charity he now learns that he's given to a slush
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  fund for grifters trump now has the power through lawsuit to unravel the entire mess at the clinton
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:20.320]  foundation which is a slush fund for grifters which is set up as you know uh as a vehicle for the
[1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:28.160]  facilitation of multi-million-dollar bribes so trump poses an enormous threat to the clintons
[1:42:28.160 --> 1:42:35.120]  an enormous threat to the status quo in washington a threat to the political and ruling elites
[1:42:35.120 --> 1:42:39.760]  good god if this man became president he could undercover he could uncover all of the government
[1:42:39.760 --> 1:42:44.080]  see well look at how he says when no other candidate's saying this that he wants to get rid of the
[1:42:44.080 --> 1:42:48.880]  tax exemption for these big hedge funds and mega banks and make them pay a modest amount i mean
[1:42:48.880 --> 1:42:53.200]  that would literally fix so many of our problems i mean those are the big globalist companies like
[1:42:53.200 --> 1:42:58.960]  goldman sacks that that run the anti-gun agenda that run the open border agenda they're the ones
[1:42:58.960 --> 1:43:05.200]  almost every time literally captaining this whole takedown and trump's going after them
[1:43:05.200 --> 1:43:11.600]  he's actually going after the crony element of wall street that is unprecedented uh the brass
[1:43:11.600 --> 1:43:17.520]  balls that that takes in the irony of course is that trump knows all these people he socializes them
[1:43:17.520 --> 1:43:22.640]  they're desperate to get into his club in palm beach the marlago club which is the most exclusive
[1:43:22.640 --> 1:43:28.160]  and sought after private club in florida but i might also add one of the few private clubs in
[1:43:28.160 --> 1:43:36.480]  palm beach that admits jews and hispanics and african americans so uh it is um it is uh almost
[1:43:36.480 --> 1:43:43.920]  laughable to see the panic at the at the political elite level and that's why this unprecedented
[1:43:43.920 --> 1:43:50.320]  smear against trump the irony of this of course is that it's having the exact reverse effect in my
[1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:59.200]  opinion meaning the more the elites attack trump the more the talking heads on cnn rip him uh uh
[1:43:59.200 --> 1:44:04.640]  the more the rights prebuses of the republican national committee come forward and denounce him
[1:44:05.200 --> 1:44:11.440]  the stronger he gets because it is a signal to average people that this guy must threaten the
[1:44:11.440 --> 1:44:18.880]  status quo that he is a real harbinger of change so um yesterday there was a bloomberg survey
[1:44:19.440 --> 1:44:26.000]  which showed that two-thirds of republican primary voters agreed with trump when they were asked the
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  narrow and fair question of whether they wanted a temporary halt in muslim immigration of course
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:39.440]  that's not what the mainstream media would have you believe he proposed but there is overwhelming
[1:44:39.440 --> 1:44:48.320]  support for trump's position uh and uh i think that this also reflects a reuters poll that was
[1:44:48.320 --> 1:44:55.200]  done uh on a daily tracking basis while they didn't ask the precise question about trump's proposal
[1:44:55.200 --> 1:45:02.560]  they did look at republican primary voter attitudes towards muslims and the muslim community
[1:45:02.560 --> 1:45:09.840]  and they see the possibility of danger they realize that of all these hundreds of thousands of of
[1:45:11.040 --> 1:45:15.600]  immigrants who would like to come to this country while i'm sure that many many of them are decent
[1:45:16.160 --> 1:45:22.480]  peace loving people americans aren't stupid they know that there's a terrorist contingent in there
[1:45:22.480 --> 1:45:27.760]  of course this is a this is a zone syria where hundreds of thousands of jihadis invaded they've
[1:45:27.760 --> 1:45:32.320]  gotten their butts handed to them so now they're getting into turkey and europe and come to the u.s
[1:45:32.320 --> 1:45:38.080]  there's a good percentage of them and we got polls he cited them 21 percent 25 percent 27 percent
[1:45:38.080 --> 1:45:42.480]  we showed those last hour on screen we'll show them again saying they support jihad and suicide
[1:45:42.480 --> 1:45:48.000]  bombers and they've got fake passports most of them they're not even syria we would be insane
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:52.720]  to continue this so so what is the government thinking bringing them in knowing they're going
[1:45:52.720 --> 1:45:56.960]  to blow stuff up and shoot people yeah it's really extraordinary of course we had the
[1:45:56.960 --> 1:46:03.600]  lesson of paris where a terrorist moves seamlessly through that nation's immigrant process to
[1:46:03.600 --> 1:46:09.680]  mastermind the mass killings last week i don't know how uh use trump's words how stupid can the
[1:46:09.680 --> 1:46:15.360]  american people be i must tell you i'm very comfortable about an election that is framed
[1:46:15.360 --> 1:46:22.720]  around these issues i am very comfortable comparing trump's proposal with hillary clinton's record on
[1:46:22.720 --> 1:46:27.520]  middle eastern issues and of course her closest record of giving stinger missiles to al-qaeda you
[1:46:27.520 --> 1:46:34.000]  mean that record well the record of of arming isis because she's the one who armed them in her fury
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:40.480]  to try to depose qaddafi and insert a regime that is loyal and now she says trump's helping isis
[1:46:40.480 --> 1:46:47.760]  you talk about upending reality yeah it's kafka ask uh it's it's typical big media big government
[1:46:47.760 --> 1:46:54.000]  doublespeak where they say the exact opposite of what is true the good news is the american people
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:59.680]  are waking up they're they're not buying this line anymore in my opinion only trump would put
[1:46:59.680 --> 1:47:07.200]  forward a a an aggressive strategy to crush isis this pinprick approach that barack obama says
[1:47:07.200 --> 1:47:14.320]  he's utilizing clearly is not working at all and then uh you know i am kind of uh interested because
[1:47:14.320 --> 1:47:21.360]  the other day huma abedin also known as mrs carlos danger the top aide to hillary clinton also known
[1:47:21.360 --> 1:47:27.360]  as mrs hillary or mrs hillary clinton yeah perhaps uh but who i mean i'm not hillary which one is the
[1:47:27.360 --> 1:47:33.520]  mrs i'm sorry it is hard to it is hard to say isn't it yes uh but look huma is uh beautiful she's
[1:47:33.520 --> 1:47:40.480]  exotic uh she's very chicly dressed good for hillary yeah and she's completely loyal to the muslim
[1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:45.520]  brotherhood her parents and her brothers are very active in the muslim brotherhood she is written
[1:47:45.520 --> 1:47:51.520]  for a muslim brotherhood funded publication for many years um her loyalty is not to the united
[1:47:51.520 --> 1:47:57.840]  states so one must ask how does she get a security clearance from the u.s. state department or maybe
[1:47:57.840 --> 1:48:04.960]  she never had a security clearance maybe that's why hillary had to use an outside server so that
[1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:11.680]  huma could look at all those classified documents and then decide what we should be allowed to see
[1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:16.400]  and what we shouldn't be allowed to say that's right i mean i have must tell you i spent uh
[1:48:16.400 --> 1:48:21.520]  many years in government as an aide to three presidents and i never saw a situation in which
[1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:27.760]  an individual got a special waiver that allowed her to get a full-time salary at the state department
[1:48:28.560 --> 1:48:34.400]  at the same time she's pulling down a second paycheck from tanao which is a clinton connected
[1:48:34.400 --> 1:48:40.720]  lobbying organization which has clients that lobby the state department at the third time
[1:48:40.720 --> 1:48:46.880]  same time whom is pulling down yet a third paycheck from the clinton foundation now we know that the
[1:48:46.880 --> 1:48:54.240]  clinton foundation and the state department uh had business in the sense that many corporations
[1:48:54.240 --> 1:48:59.680]  many foreign nations many wealthy people realized if you had a big decision at state department
[1:48:59.680 --> 1:49:04.880]  that meant millions of dollars to your pocket you could buy american decision making by giving
[1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:11.280]  enormous contributions to the clinton foundation so uh it really is a vehicle for the facilitation
[1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:17.120]  these multi-million-dollar bribes huma abedin was right in the middle of that and of course last
[1:49:17.120 --> 1:49:23.680]  week uh or i should say earlier this week huma abedin was among those denouncing donald j trump
[1:49:23.680 --> 1:49:28.240]  what could be a greater badge of honor than to be attacked by well she tried to imply he wanted to
[1:49:28.240 --> 1:49:32.320]  throw her out i mean maybe she should be thrown out but after her loyalties are investigated
[1:49:32.320 --> 1:49:36.720]  i mean i'm sick of the arrogance of all these foreigners and people that just think america
[1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:41.440]  is this big doormat and that we're here to be culled and and and cowed into submission but
[1:49:41.440 --> 1:49:47.200]  beginning back to donald trump himself six months ago when this stuff first started i wasn't sure i
[1:49:47.200 --> 1:49:53.040]  did more research uh and then i saw where he wasn't so many policies i saw how they demonized him
[1:49:53.040 --> 1:49:58.880]  i saw how the big money came out against him i saw the republican leadership lineup against
[1:49:58.880 --> 1:50:03.920]  him all that was a better sign that he really was for real now i've seen him come out against the
[1:50:03.920 --> 1:50:09.200]  big banks being tax exempt i've seen him come out unequivocally for the second amendment i've seen
[1:50:09.200 --> 1:50:14.560]  him come out for you know blowing up the isis oil fields all this stuff is the opposite of what the
[1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:19.040]  establishment wants he clearly knows what he's talking about and then he talks about how our
[1:50:19.040 --> 1:50:24.000]  borders are gone we're being brought into globalism we're being shut down we're being dismantled
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:28.400]  and i'm just not hearing this out of anybody but ten crews and a little bit out of rand paul and i've
[1:50:28.400 --> 1:50:32.560]  supported you know both of them i'd be happy with any three of those guys being president but then i
[1:50:32.560 --> 1:50:39.280]  just love the fact that he calls out the media he's already started a revolution in the debates
[1:50:39.280 --> 1:50:45.200]  where where they all laugh at the moderators uh who are basically political pundits and i see the
[1:50:45.200 --> 1:50:51.920]  whole facade the force field around the globalist almost dissolving with just donald trump being a
[1:50:51.920 --> 1:50:59.040]  candidate uh it's like it's it's like he's any matter to these people and it really excites me
[1:50:59.600 --> 1:51:04.480]  and the fact that he's not a coward the fact that he is the man in the arena uh the fact that he
[1:51:04.480 --> 1:51:10.640]  doesn't back down is so exciting and that's what we need again is someone who is an individual
[1:51:10.640 --> 1:51:17.680]  someone who doesn't come from some weirdo leftist cult or some neocon cult or some you know weird
[1:51:17.680 --> 1:51:23.920]  group we need somebody who really does want to turn this country loose to do great things and i'm
[1:51:23.920 --> 1:51:30.000]  sold but donald trump's for real i'm sold he really wants to cut taxes and bring back our sovereignty
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:35.920]  and kick criminals out of the nation and do all those things i just asked myself though when he
[1:51:35.920 --> 1:51:42.320]  does shoot for the from the hip he is teleprompter free he is talking point free what's brought him
[1:51:42.320 --> 1:51:47.840]  to this prominence could also be taken out of context to bring him down but but maybe that is
[1:51:48.880 --> 1:51:55.840]  a sign that the public has so much broken with the establishment uh that they don't care what they do
[1:51:55.840 --> 1:52:00.800]  to him they're going to continue to support him hey i want you to speak to that as a top presidential
[1:52:00.800 --> 1:52:07.040]  advisor a guy that's run major campaigns around the world roger stone our guest and then specifically
[1:52:07.040 --> 1:52:10.800]  what are the dirty tricks they're going to pull uh what is the mathematical
[1:52:11.520 --> 1:52:17.520]  electorate constellation that tells you he is electable in a general election roger stone
[1:52:20.080 --> 1:52:25.040]  well let's tackle this one by one first of all i have no question that he is the strongest possible
[1:52:25.040 --> 1:52:31.280]  candidate against taylor e clinton even some of the preliminary polls and i don't mean online polls
[1:52:31.280 --> 1:52:36.560]  where you can vote and then push refresh and vote again and then vote and push refresh and vote again
[1:52:36.560 --> 1:52:42.720]  i'm talking about scientific based polls with an accurate and carefully balanced perfectly drawn
[1:52:42.720 --> 1:52:50.000]  sample show that trump is already pulling on precedent levels of blacks catholics and union
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:56.800]  members individual rank and file ruin union members i believe that he could uh draw literally millions
[1:52:56.800 --> 1:53:01.680]  of people into the electoral process who have given up on politics are you talking about reagan
[1:53:01.680 --> 1:53:06.320]  democrats and people well i think it's even beyond that i think it's beyond reagan democrats yes i
[1:53:06.320 --> 1:53:12.080]  think he can get those blue collar ethnic democrats those working class democrats who are as sick
[1:53:12.880 --> 1:53:17.920]  of the elitism and the big government and the big spending and the big taxing policies
[1:53:17.920 --> 1:53:22.960]  uh and the low employment policies of washington but beyond that i think there are millions of
[1:53:22.960 --> 1:53:28.560]  people who like you and i alex realize that both parties have morphed into one party
[1:53:29.280 --> 1:53:34.640]  that the choice that is presented to the voters like the choice between romney and obama is a
[1:53:34.640 --> 1:53:40.800]  false choice that the two parties are the same the parties of endless war erosion of our civil
[1:53:40.800 --> 1:53:48.480]  liberties massive debt uh unhinge spending uh the list goes on and on so i think there are
[1:53:49.200 --> 1:53:56.640]  millions of americans for whom trump uh it looks like something different a real reformer i think
[1:53:56.640 --> 1:54:03.440]  he can pull those people back into the political process and that is why he is the strongest
[1:54:03.440 --> 1:54:09.520]  potential republican candidate it aggravates me that people keep asking him well are you going
[1:54:09.520 --> 1:54:15.200]  to run as an independent he's the front runner for the republican nomination not by a little bit by
[1:54:15.200 --> 1:54:21.360]  a lot by 10 points why would he even consider it we'll all do respect go ask rand paul that question
[1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:27.120]  he's running he's running laps his father once bolted the gop to run as an independent maybe
[1:54:27.120 --> 1:54:31.920]  it's a more appropriate question for senator paul at this point i want to be clear i don't want to
[1:54:31.920 --> 1:54:38.320]  run senator rand paul down but i'm an honest person and i knew him 20 years ago back when
[1:54:38.320 --> 1:54:43.680]  he campaigned for his dad when his district came into austin um i've supported him but nice to him
[1:54:43.680 --> 1:54:50.080]  his dad comes on uh total integrity love the pauls but the way ran gets advised now the things he
[1:54:50.080 --> 1:54:57.680]  does um i mean you notice ted cruz is smart and isn't attacking trump i just don't get it and i
[1:54:57.680 --> 1:55:04.800]  really wanted ran to be more aggressive like a trump uh and it's just it's just very sad yeah
[1:55:04.800 --> 1:55:10.480]  no look i i share your high regard for both rand paul and his father the very last vote i cast as a
[1:55:10.480 --> 1:55:17.840]  republican was for ron paul and the florida primary uh against mit romney uh and i'm an admirer of
[1:55:17.840 --> 1:55:23.120]  rand paul although i i think he seems to have lost his bearings here i mean i'm not sure who he is
[1:55:23.120 --> 1:55:28.480]  you can't be all things to all men you can't be both a libertarian and a traditional conservative
[1:55:29.200 --> 1:55:33.680]  and then try to trim your foreign policy to show that you really are a statist i just think
[1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:40.160]  his candidacy uh has failed and sadly i think it is over but the personal attacks on donald trump
[1:55:40.160 --> 1:55:45.360]  those i can't figure out they have golfed together i happen to know that donald trump likes senator
[1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:51.200]  paul and says by the way he's an exceptional golfer so um it is probably why trump's been
[1:55:51.200 --> 1:55:56.080]  snapping back at him because they were friends and then paul makes crappy comments about well one
[1:55:56.080 --> 1:56:00.640]  thing i can tell you about trump having spent an enormous amount of time with him if you punch trump
[1:56:00.640 --> 1:56:05.920]  you better be prepared to get punched back at twice the velocity it's it's just his nature do not
[1:56:06.800 --> 1:56:12.080]  do not awaken the sleeping beast if you attack donald trump you better expect incoming and it'll
[1:56:12.080 --> 1:56:18.160]  be almost immediate well moving on from senator paul it's a sad story uh just kind of let the
[1:56:18.160 --> 1:56:23.440]  dead bury the dead politically at this point unless he wakes up with those snot nose young
[1:56:23.440 --> 1:56:26.720]  republicans he's got to round him up there in his campaign i don't mean to be mean but that's just
[1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:32.320]  i mean you're talking about the tail wagging the dog here i'm just gonna say it and move on um but
[1:56:33.600 --> 1:56:38.080]  how do we get behind trump how do we stop the dirty treks how do we get him into the presidency
[1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:42.320]  because nothing makes me like him more i mean i'm moving towards a hundred percent mark now
[1:56:42.320 --> 1:56:47.280]  with all these wolves attacking and all these cowards piling on the one man in the arena
[1:56:47.280 --> 1:56:52.640]  uh i mean that's you're talking my language right there well let me just predict right now
[1:56:52.640 --> 1:56:59.760]  that the next major attack on trump uh will will be a bogus claim that he is somehow mobbed up
[1:56:59.760 --> 1:57:05.040]  i can or there's a half dozen news organizations who've been working on this for months now what
[1:57:05.040 --> 1:57:12.000]  they don't seem to know is that uh that trump has for over 15 years held a new jersey casino
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:20.080]  control operators license the new jersey casino control law is the most stringent law in the
[1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:25.840]  country in other words you can be denied a license just having met a mobster you don't have to do
[1:57:25.840 --> 1:57:29.440]  business with them you don't have to trade money with them you have to buy anything from them
[1:57:29.440 --> 1:57:36.240]  just a social occasion in which you are together can be enough to deny you a license they are very
[1:57:36.240 --> 1:57:42.560]  very very sensitive to organize crime influence in the gaming industry in new jersey by the way
[1:57:42.560 --> 1:57:47.280]  the new jersey law is so stringent it is the model for most of the laws in the country
[1:57:47.280 --> 1:57:53.200]  that have uh that have legalized casino gambling donald trump has been gone over by the new jersey
[1:57:53.200 --> 1:58:00.000]  casino control commission with a proctor scope there is nothing there now being in the construction
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:06.240]  industry in the northeastern united states has he met guys who are mob connected probably uh is
[1:58:06.240 --> 1:58:12.160]  he in bed with the mob in no way shape or form and no one ever alleged that with his dad and people
[1:58:12.160 --> 1:58:16.160]  it is hard to believe he's one of the only clean people you know in that whole thing but that's
[1:58:16.160 --> 1:58:20.560]  he was the outsider it was well known that came in and broke into that that's why he carried a gun
[1:58:20.560 --> 1:58:25.200]  i mean that's what i've read is that correct that is absolutely right donald trump is squeaky clean
[1:58:25.200 --> 1:58:31.440]  but you but be prepared for a mainstream media onslaught trying to claim that he is somehow
[1:58:31.440 --> 1:58:35.120]  mobbed up because all right so that's going to be the empire striking back stay there sir
[1:58:35.120 --> 1:58:45.600]  back in 70 seconds pop insider on with us right now thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today
[1:58:48.560 --> 1:58:56.320]  who do you prefer barack obama or george w bush well if you haven't figured it out by now these
[1:58:56.320 --> 1:59:02.560]  guys are corporate spokesmen they're not leaders i mean they both started illegal wars hell they
[1:59:02.560 --> 1:59:08.320]  both tortured people they bailed out criminal corporations and they spied on you they both
[1:59:08.320 --> 1:59:14.080]  violated the constitution and they even committed war crimes so what's it gonna take i mean what
[1:59:14.080 --> 1:59:20.560]  will it take to finally wake you up think about it if joseph stalin ran for president as a democrat
[1:59:20.560 --> 1:59:27.520]  and adolf hitler ran as a republican one of them would end up leading our country it's politics
[1:59:27.520 --> 1:59:34.000]  incorporated and your choice between the two parties is a myth because in reality it is a
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:41.200]  two-party tyranny with one ideology divide and conquer so join the revolution and break
[1:59:41.200 --> 2:00:00.560]  the false left versus right paradigm info wars dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:05.520 --> 2:00:08.000]  it's a long way to the top if you want to be president
[2:00:08.000 --> 2:00:15.280]  you're part of a political combine like obama from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[2:00:17.680 --> 2:00:24.720]  well roger stone i can tell you is swift voting the clintons and the bushes
[2:00:25.600 --> 2:00:30.640]  as the best-selling author with accurate info i've read the clinton's war on women
[2:00:31.760 --> 2:00:36.400]  can't wait till the book on the bush crime family jab in the bush crime family comes out
[2:00:36.400 --> 2:00:41.440]  out these are both topics i'm very well researched on so when i hear stone speaking to it when he was
[2:00:41.440 --> 2:00:46.880]  on last time it was so incredibly accurate we'll cover some of that coming up in the next segment
[2:00:46.880 --> 2:00:53.920]  and then i promise i'll go to your calls i'm sorry to tony isaiah erica kevin dan and others i
[2:00:53.920 --> 2:00:57.840]  know i said i'd go to your calls and then i didn't and then the guest caught on but i will in the
[2:00:57.840 --> 2:01:01.600]  next segment we'll get some of your calls out of the way with your comments and questions on trump i
[2:01:01.600 --> 2:01:08.320]  promise uh but it takes a lot of will this fellow has worked directly with three presidents very
[2:01:08.320 --> 2:01:13.520]  closely worked for many others as well but you know been in the oval office and this is a very
[2:01:13.520 --> 2:01:18.320]  dangerous book and the other one from the facts he stated from it that i know to be true because
[2:01:18.320 --> 2:01:23.040]  i'm i'm an expert on these subjects i've been living it for 20 years interviewing all the people
[2:01:23.040 --> 2:01:27.680]  involved i mean the cia pilots who were there unloading the cocaine with the bushes and the
[2:01:27.680 --> 2:01:31.600]  clintons i mean the bushes and the clintons are totally worked for each other they are mafia
[2:01:33.200 --> 2:01:38.240]  they are the mafia above the mafia i mean they denied until the 50s that lakosa nostra existed
[2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:46.240]  and then it became only mafia was italian that's ridiculous the real mob is above that and really
[2:01:46.240 --> 2:01:51.680]  donald trump from what i've seen is trying to break into their system with the people
[2:01:52.400 --> 2:01:57.040]  but you look at the bushes the clintons to me they're the original mafia the true mafia
[2:01:57.040 --> 2:02:00.640]  the other term arkansas i mean it's not an accurate statement roger stone that
[2:02:00.640 --> 2:02:06.160]  they better watch out throwing stones in glass houses because these are the true mafiosos
[2:02:06.160 --> 2:02:12.320]  yeah there's no question i i refer to it as the bush clinton crime syndicate uh and my two books
[2:02:12.320 --> 2:02:18.240]  the clintons war on women and the upcoming jeb uh and the uh and the bush crime family they're
[2:02:18.240 --> 2:02:24.160]  really bookends they really complement each other in terms of detailing the profiteering
[2:02:24.160 --> 2:02:30.480]  and criminal activity that both families have conducted together rehabilitating each other
[2:02:31.040 --> 2:02:36.960]  profiteering together boosting each other politically you know i alex i had to reflect
[2:02:36.960 --> 2:02:42.880]  on that the commercial that i just heard because uh as you know i cut my teeth in politics working
[2:02:42.880 --> 2:02:50.560]  for richard nixon and nixon was very very proud of his martini making talents he made a mean martini
[2:02:50.560 --> 2:02:56.480]  and he referred to them as silver bullets as soon as you as soon as you would get to his
[2:02:56.480 --> 2:03:02.640]  place in in uh saddle ridge he would say hey how about a silver bullet and then he himself would
[2:03:02.640 --> 2:03:07.920]  make you a very dry martini and you would drink the martini you say wow mr president this is
[2:03:07.920 --> 2:03:13.840]  fabulous and he said yeah let me tell you my recipe he says you take a bottle of olives
[2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:19.680]  you drain the olives you pour in vermouth you put it in the refrigerator then when you're ready you
[2:03:19.680 --> 2:03:26.160]  pour the vodka or gin over ice in your shaker you make it as cold as possible and you drop in one
[2:03:26.160 --> 2:03:31.920]  olive and then that way it's very dry so what mr president that's fabulous he said yeah i got the
[2:03:31.920 --> 2:03:37.760]  recipe from church hill wow see i just want to get you on time uh to talk about all these
[2:03:37.760 --> 2:03:41.920]  presidential stories because they're so interesting and i don't romanticize nixon i know he had some
[2:03:41.920 --> 2:03:46.160]  problems but many problems but compared to other ones i mean he was one of the least criminal
[2:03:46.160 --> 2:03:51.680]  from what i've known uh and that's why they took him out was because he wanted to actually be president
[2:03:51.680 --> 2:03:56.480]  and the bureaucracy wanted to be in charge is that accurate yes and he was he was he was challenging
[2:03:56.480 --> 2:04:02.400]  the industrial complex war machine good he ended the war in vietnam that cut into their their profits
[2:04:02.400 --> 2:04:07.360]  he opened the door to conversations with china and a relationship with china and then he moved to the
[2:04:07.360 --> 2:04:12.320]  salt agreement so nixon turned out to be a peacemaker that's not what the boys at the pentagon
[2:04:12.320 --> 2:04:17.920]  or the central intelligence agency had in mind now look nixon was far from perfect taking us off
[2:04:17.920 --> 2:04:25.200]  the gold standard enormous mistake the war on drugs a big expensive inefficient mistake i don't make
[2:04:25.200 --> 2:04:30.880]  the case uh as much although i have great affection for nixon and his personal resilience i make no
[2:04:30.880 --> 2:04:37.040]  case that he was in any way perfect but compared to the illegality unconstitutionality of what we have
[2:04:37.040 --> 2:04:43.760]  today nixon would be rolling in his grave if he saw what barack obama and the clintons have gotten
[2:04:43.760 --> 2:04:48.400]  away with absolutely stay there i want to come back hit some phone calls with you we got you for
[2:04:48.400 --> 2:04:53.040]  the rest of the hour and then i want to get more into how we get behind donald trump because i mean
[2:04:53.040 --> 2:04:56.560]  folks the whole system's coming after him that right there is the certification he's for real
[2:04:59.520 --> 2:05:03.520]  did you know that when you're serving jury duty you have complete authority over the law
[2:05:03.520 --> 2:05:07.760]  in the power to stop the government that's right as a juror you cannot only judge the defendant
[2:05:07.760 --> 2:05:11.760]  but also the law he's being charged with as well and that's the little known secret prosecutors
[2:05:11.760 --> 2:05:15.760]  don't want you to know for example let's say a man is charged with marijuana possession and you
[2:05:15.760 --> 2:05:19.680]  don't agree with that law well as a juror you can decline charging the man because you don't
[2:05:19.680 --> 2:05:24.080]  believe the law is justified judges and prosecutors have misled juries and to believe in that they
[2:05:24.080 --> 2:05:28.160]  should only examine the facts of the case and not the law but the juror can actually stop the
[2:05:28.160 --> 2:05:32.480]  enforcement of unconstitutional laws in two ways as a grand jury you may refuse the government's
[2:05:32.480 --> 2:05:36.960]  request to pursue criminal charges against the accused and as a trial juror you can acquit the
[2:05:36.960 --> 2:05:40.960]  defendant who is charged with breaking an unconstitutional law either way by using jury
[2:05:40.960 --> 2:05:45.600]  nullification the juror has the power to say no thus having an immediate indirect effect on our
[2:05:45.600 --> 2:05:49.680]  government you can find out more from the fully informed jury association which can be found at

[2:08:18.960 --> 2:08:26.720]  nothing if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance we now take you live to the
[2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:51.040]  central texas command center it's alex jones and the final equation the elite have a nine percent
[2:08:51.040 --> 2:08:57.040]  approval rating for congress the people are waking up in general the attempt to flood the country
[2:08:57.040 --> 2:09:03.760]  with immigrants that are ignorant isn't going to work the overall global strategy is collapsing
[2:09:04.960 --> 2:09:10.480]  they have a strategy of tension to keep people in turmoil but when they even use those systems
[2:09:10.480 --> 2:09:16.320]  on the first world their command base their funding their power their prowess their good name
[2:09:16.320 --> 2:09:22.480]  their soft power in the end it brings these elites down as well roamed at the same thing
[2:09:23.680 --> 2:09:30.320]  1800 years ago began its collapse took 200 years but it happened nowadays things happen
[2:09:30.320 --> 2:09:37.200]  a lot quicker and whether it's europe or the united states we see a willful suiciding
[2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:43.920]  of the good institutions and of common sense by a criminal class that wants to loot like
[2:09:43.920 --> 2:09:52.560]  barbarian vagabonds or vizagoths the system itself they want to kill the golden goose and i say that
[2:09:53.440 --> 2:09:59.120]  from a cynical perspective i personally am shovelers i have a moral perspective it's where
[2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:05.040]  my energy comes from it's who i am i'm looking for other people like me but even as a sociopath if
[2:10:05.040 --> 2:10:09.120]  i looked at it through those eyes which i do any general is supposed to look through their enemies
[2:10:09.120 --> 2:10:14.960]  eyes this doesn't even make sense until you realize it's their very instinct to screw everything up
[2:10:14.960 --> 2:10:21.520]  we're going to ask roger stone about that about knowing donald trump for decades what really makes
[2:10:21.520 --> 2:10:27.600]  him tick because i think personalizing him is the one thing people really want to know about
[2:10:27.600 --> 2:10:32.480]  to commit their support for him what he thinks they'll do to try to shut him down after the mob
[2:10:32.480 --> 2:10:39.680]  claims he says are coming and i already see that drum beginning to beat and then we'll get into other
[2:10:39.680 --> 2:10:44.880]  facets of this in general where mr stone sees the world going and then having back soon for another
[2:10:44.880 --> 2:10:50.160]  interview about presidents in general and politics i want to talk about some of the delegate processes
[2:10:50.160 --> 2:10:54.160]  some of the dirty tricks they might pull try to keep trump out how we get involved the delegate
[2:10:54.160 --> 2:10:59.040]  process like my friend richard reeves is to try to stop that and that's a whole other interview
[2:10:59.040 --> 2:11:03.760]  as well probably in person here because i want stone to be with us a lot because of his understanding
[2:11:03.760 --> 2:11:11.680]  of this but now let's go to some phone calls again the website is stonezone.com it's an
[2:11:11.680 --> 2:11:16.640]  excellent site with commentary photos analysis decades with him working at the white house
[2:11:17.360 --> 2:11:22.960]  and his books the new book is the clinton's war on women and if you can find it good luck it's
[2:11:22.960 --> 2:11:27.680]  sold out in many areas but we're trying to get 5 000 of them ourselves very hot book right now
[2:11:27.680 --> 2:11:32.800]  um but uh let's go to tony in tennessee thank you for holding you're a trooper
[2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:40.160]  listening on wbcr 14 70 a.m you're on the air go ahead oh thanks for taking my call i've been
[2:11:40.160 --> 2:11:46.160]  a listener since 99 uh you know there there's a special out there that everybody needs to go
[2:11:46.160 --> 2:11:53.440]  listen to it's called you've been trumped done about four years ago and this is what don trump
[2:11:53.440 --> 2:11:59.120]  tried to do to the people over in scotland because he wanted to build a golf course
[2:12:00.160 --> 2:12:05.120]  he's not a nice guy no i have heard that the one little chink people can bring up is imminent
[2:12:05.120 --> 2:12:10.080]  domain issues uh and then that's brought up all day and that's just what builders go through i'm
[2:12:10.080 --> 2:12:14.720]  not i'm not saying that's that's perfect so that's fine uh let me ask you would you rather have
[2:12:14.720 --> 2:12:21.520]  hillary clinton bernie sanders or jeb bush then well then there is also the the matter of the
[2:12:21.520 --> 2:12:26.400]  four million dollars that you just now gave your ex-wife and your recent divorce okay that's none
[2:12:26.400 --> 2:12:32.320]  of that's true and so uh that was some kind of weird seminar call right there um that this is
[2:12:32.320 --> 2:12:36.960]  somebody i guess that just doesn't like this broadcast would you like to and that's fine make
[2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:43.040]  up whatever you want uh let's go ahead and get roger stones take on that uh you know don trump
[2:12:43.040 --> 2:12:51.760]  is a developer and he has uh uh he has uh skepticism about so-called green energy about uh this
[2:12:51.760 --> 2:12:57.280]  windmill technology which turns out to be far more expensive than the older technologies to
[2:12:57.280 --> 2:13:02.640]  generate electricity uh he's built some of the greatest golf courses uh in the world
[2:13:02.640 --> 2:13:08.080]  he's built some of the greatest resorts in the world in fact he's climbed to the top of that mountain
[2:13:08.080 --> 2:13:14.320]  that's why i think he's now turning his energy towards saving this country that he's done every
[2:13:14.320 --> 2:13:19.920]  great real estate development that you can have alex this guy has a terrific life he's got a beautiful
[2:13:19.920 --> 2:13:24.960]  family that he loves he likes spending time with him he's a scratch golfer and he loves to play golf
[2:13:24.960 --> 2:13:32.560]  but instead he's made 18 trips to isla on saturdays to meet voters and unroll out roll out a campaign
[2:13:33.440 --> 2:13:38.000]  there's no question once he becomes president he will be stepping down in terms of the quality
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:42.960]  of his airplane uh and his home not that there's anything wrong with air force one and the white
[2:13:42.960 --> 2:13:49.840]  house but i've seen the trump lifestyle and he lives like what he is a self-made billionaire uh in
[2:13:49.840 --> 2:13:57.600]  all honesty when we're talking about this nation's absolute survival then a golf course in scotland
[2:13:57.600 --> 2:14:05.520]  seems kind of mundane sure and americans americans hate unmade people that made hundreds of millions
[2:14:05.520 --> 2:14:09.760]  like hillary with her total elitism where you can't even look her in the eyes this has been
[2:14:09.760 --> 2:14:15.120]  confirmed uh when she is at a hotel or being served by somebody doesn't give people tips
[2:14:15.120 --> 2:14:19.840]  treats them like total crud i've gotten turned on to trump more the last six months investigating
[2:14:19.840 --> 2:14:24.640]  him talking to people that you don't even know you know he knows or knows that say big tipper
[2:14:24.640 --> 2:14:29.360]  super nice treats everybody so good unless you mess with him then he's pretty aggressive
[2:14:29.360 --> 2:14:36.160]  uh this is the irony for a guy who's worth 10 billion dollars probably more at this point
[2:14:36.800 --> 2:14:44.080]  he's a regular guy he's very very funny he's got a great sense of humor he loves a good cheeseburger
[2:14:44.640 --> 2:14:50.960]  he's got a risque sense of humor uh he's fun to be with working for trump i can honestly tell you
[2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:57.360]  over the years i've worked on an op worm for 37 years it has always been fun i've had a good time
[2:14:57.360 --> 2:15:02.080]  but i actually like the fact that he'll go on a lot of wild shows not just mine but something
[2:15:02.080 --> 2:15:06.720]  like howard stern when all these other fake stuff suits wouldn't do it we need somebody that'll get
[2:15:06.720 --> 2:15:10.720]  in there and get their hands dirty i'm sick of all this fake elitism and i did look into the whole
[2:15:11.280 --> 2:15:16.320]  thing you know he pays for it he gets it there's a plan for a golf course then people start wanting
[2:15:16.320 --> 2:15:20.320]  more money and then you run over them and build the golf course could you say it's bad could you
[2:15:20.320 --> 2:15:24.880]  say it's good wait until you're in those shoes the question is do you want would you rather have
[2:15:24.880 --> 2:15:31.120]  hillary clinton and then the guy didn't respond to that he just made something up well look that was
[2:15:31.120 --> 2:15:36.880]  a crank call as far as i'm concerned here's what's interesting and that is that i love the way trump
[2:15:36.880 --> 2:15:44.160]  for example last night with don lemmon on cnn or last weekend with chuck todd where he won't be bullied
[2:15:44.160 --> 2:15:51.680]  by these by these commentators where he cuts them off and he says uh uh no wait a minute chuck cool
[2:15:51.680 --> 2:15:57.360]  it chuck cool down chuck or when he says last night to don lemmon excuse me excuse me when they try
[2:15:57.360 --> 2:16:04.960]  to cut him off which as you know is a classic media stunt to try to dominate these and bully
[2:16:04.960 --> 2:16:10.080]  these political figures well that's what they try with me and i just do it right back to them they
[2:16:10.080 --> 2:16:15.760]  can't stand it yeah i agree uh let's go ahead and talk to uh isaiah in california you're on the air
[2:16:15.760 --> 2:16:23.040]  with our guest elix how's it going good brother go ahead hey i just want to say thank you for
[2:16:23.040 --> 2:16:30.080]  uh helping me on the air and uh i want to kind of give a shout out to your uh info wars life uh
[2:16:30.080 --> 2:16:34.320]  have a lot of your product and they're awesome thank you um but that's besides the point
[2:16:36.480 --> 2:16:40.160]  i want to say trump he's a fighter you know you guys been kind of talking about that
[2:16:40.160 --> 2:16:48.080]  and um he's ruthless man i think he's good for america um of course i'm i'm always skeptical
[2:16:48.080 --> 2:16:56.320]  of any kind of politician uh myself but you know um people are gonna attack him they're going to
[2:16:56.320 --> 2:17:03.280]  continuously attack him and i think he's kind of got the goal for it and i believe you know
[2:17:03.280 --> 2:17:07.680]  even if he doesn't win this war he's already done a lot of damage just by running the race
[2:17:07.680 --> 2:17:12.000]  i agree he's brought out a lot of stuff into the agenda that they don't want on the agenda and
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:15.680]  this is what i want to say about trump they've tried to emasculate us they've tried to destroy
[2:17:15.680 --> 2:17:21.120]  the image of an aggressive dominant male because they want a nation of servile cowards and if we
[2:17:21.120 --> 2:17:26.880]  were already super aggressive super male and attacking a bunch of places and you know uh
[2:17:26.880 --> 2:17:31.440]  doing bad things then i would sit there and say we don't need something like this but we have a
[2:17:31.440 --> 2:17:37.680]  bureaucracy that does all these bad things in our name but then once us week and and and donald trump
[2:17:38.400 --> 2:17:46.000]  clearly has the type of attitude and confidence that america needs and he wants 10 growth rates a
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:51.440]  year not these fake three percent that are really negative he wants to have not a monopoly economy
[2:17:51.440 --> 2:17:56.400]  but a big burgeoning economy because he's made his money off of there being a wealthy economy
[2:17:56.400 --> 2:18:01.200]  and he talks about this and he wants america to win and the fact that he'd want america to win
[2:18:01.200 --> 2:18:06.400]  all these politicians like obama and others they want to graduate up to the world government level
[2:18:06.960 --> 2:18:12.400]  they want to be the ones that mounted america's head on the wall and made us the globalist
[2:18:12.400 --> 2:18:17.840]  you know bitch basically to use you know for lack of a better word that's why they hate trump so much
[2:18:17.840 --> 2:18:24.720]  and he doesn't want to be part of their club he builds his own clubs and so that's americana
[2:18:24.720 --> 2:18:28.640]  and that's why they hate him so much is that an accurate statement roger stone i think that's
[2:18:28.640 --> 2:18:33.040]  exactly right look trump has built one of the great fortunes of all time and now he wants to make
[2:18:33.040 --> 2:18:40.320]  the american people rich trump stands for success he stands for for uh for prosperity for full
[2:18:40.320 --> 2:18:45.680]  employment for opportunity this is why i think those who say oh he's not going to get any hispanic
[2:18:45.680 --> 2:18:50.480]  votes he's not going to get any african-american they're completely wrong there are aspirational
[2:18:50.480 --> 2:18:57.760]  people in those groups of americans um who want a piece of the pie they want their own success
[2:18:57.760 --> 2:19:03.600]  trump is above all a capitalist uh and he believes that this country could be restored
[2:19:03.600 --> 2:19:10.000]  to greatness look take for example his plan to cut the corporate tax rate which is currently 35
[2:19:10.720 --> 2:19:18.640]  china is 25 trump would cut it to 15 literally overnight all these multinational corporations
[2:19:18.640 --> 2:19:24.640]  doing business in china would come home because suddenly it would be more profitable to do business
[2:19:24.640 --> 2:19:30.080]  here exactly the globalists did that to make our jobs the basis of them go overseas as a plan to
[2:19:30.080 --> 2:19:35.040]  sabotage us exactly trump would reverse that process and you would have one of the greatest
[2:19:35.040 --> 2:19:42.480]  economic booms this country has ever seen there's two trillion dollars offshore that's being kept
[2:19:42.480 --> 2:19:45.840]  offshore to avoid taxation that's right but he would make them bring that money back and that's
[2:19:45.840 --> 2:19:51.360]  good stay there that's important isaiah thank you erica kevin dan your calls are up next with roger

[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:17.440]  Stone of the clinton's war on women is our guest but he is a bipartisan truth teller
[2:24:17.440 --> 2:24:24.960]  he's got a new book that's bookends with it coming out on jeb bush and the bush crime family bush
[2:24:24.960 --> 2:24:31.600]  crime syndicate put out by sky horse publishing we're going to go to dan in texas and others
[2:24:31.600 --> 2:24:37.280]  here in a moment but here's some of the bad news Connecticut to ban gun sales to no fly listers
[2:24:37.280 --> 2:24:42.480]  so that's literally lynching due process the no fly list is something to terrorize people
[2:24:42.480 --> 2:24:47.120]  the shooters weren't on the no fly list she was allowed in without proper vetting just as Trump
[2:24:47.120 --> 2:24:53.600]  is warned and so now he says he's going to integrate into the no fly list database so federalizing
[2:24:54.480 --> 2:24:58.400]  with a state executive order that's totally unconstitutional how those two things come
[2:24:58.400 --> 2:25:04.640]  together and that's a us say today how can a governor's executive order trump no pun intended
[2:25:04.640 --> 2:25:10.800]  um the fact that there isn't even a federal law on this yet but claim he's going to use a federal
[2:25:10.800 --> 2:25:17.520]  database at a state level to deny it i mean that is violates federalism it violates so many different
[2:25:17.520 --> 2:25:24.160]  angles of our system but the people didn't even get their guns illegally and they weren't on no
[2:25:24.160 --> 2:25:31.920]  fly list this is this is so amazing that they're doing this and then they're the ones that help
[2:25:31.920 --> 2:25:38.800]  bring these people in and then point their finger at us mr stone knowing trump so well
[2:25:39.840 --> 2:25:43.440]  obviously he's been responding to this he gets more and more hardcore on the second amendment
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:48.080]  what's your view on this and and where this fight for the second amendment's going because
[2:25:48.080 --> 2:25:51.520]  i would have said this is a fraud having a state make its own law on guns but
[2:25:52.960 --> 2:25:57.200]  in tying to the fed somehow when there is no law but the supreme court as you know just ruled two
[2:25:57.200 --> 2:26:02.640]  days ago that cities and states can restrict the second amendment really unprecedented are they
[2:26:02.640 --> 2:26:07.040]  blackmailing the supreme court it's really extraordinary look donald trump is a very
[2:26:07.040 --> 2:26:12.080]  strong supporter of the second amendment as you know he himself has a concealed carry permit in
[2:26:12.080 --> 2:26:18.560]  new york um he is packing heat a lot of the time he's smart enough not to tell us when
[2:26:18.560 --> 2:26:23.840]  you can imagine how many death threats he's had not just in this campaign but an entire career
[2:26:23.840 --> 2:26:29.920]  of being outspoken and being forthright uh he uh he rejects utterly the whole notion
[2:26:29.920 --> 2:26:35.760]  that san bernadino could somehow have been changed or avoided if we just had more stringent
[2:26:36.320 --> 2:26:42.000]  gun laws i thought he was masterful last night on cnn arguing that the exact opposite was true
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:47.280]  that if people in san bernadino had been armed some of them the outcome might have been quite
[2:26:47.280 --> 2:26:53.040]  different so uh he takes a back seat to no one in his court of the second amendment uh in new
[2:26:53.040 --> 2:26:59.600]  hampshire in iowa in south carolina a gun enthusiasts firearms owners i think formed the
[2:26:59.600 --> 2:27:05.200]  backbone backbone of much of his organizational support and i know that he is counting he and
[2:27:05.200 --> 2:27:11.520]  his team are counting very heavily on gun owners uh for support in these early contests i remember
[2:27:11.520 --> 2:27:15.360]  during that debate he said he carries a gun and they went how dare you you're worth billions of
[2:27:15.360 --> 2:27:20.640]  dollars have death threats el chopo saying he wants to kill you and you have a gun but hillary
[2:27:20.640 --> 2:27:25.680]  she can have bodyguards diane feinstein can have a concealed carry but but not you how
[2:27:26.320 --> 2:27:32.480]  police officer can but not you what a crazy idea uh let's go ahead and talk to dan in
[2:27:32.480 --> 2:27:39.920]  texas you're on the air uh with one of his top advisors mr stone yes mr jones mr stone is
[2:27:39.920 --> 2:27:47.040]  honored to speak with both of you go ahead brother yes uh so i know you both know uh that these
[2:27:47.040 --> 2:27:54.640]  elections are just one tool for people who want to basically write write every paragraph of the
[2:27:54.640 --> 2:28:03.120]  history books but uh constantly their plans are getting are backfiring when you have inconvenient
[2:28:03.120 --> 2:28:08.400]  contingencies like mr jones your documentaries mr stone your books that you've put out
[2:28:08.400 --> 2:28:16.560]  about putin uh doing airstrikes on isis i'll tell you why i think that the 2016 election is is uh an
[2:28:16.560 --> 2:28:24.240]  uninsured liability uh it's basically it's the same thing that obama capitalized on and in 08
[2:28:24.240 --> 2:28:34.320]  which is the public is so sick to the nth degree of the these pc milk toast politicians but at the
[2:28:34.320 --> 2:28:41.840]  time the public is also given pop culture which which gives us uh these figures these rappers
[2:28:41.840 --> 2:28:49.760]  these uh reality tv people comedians and then they're supposed to satisfy some kind of primal
[2:28:49.760 --> 2:28:56.160]  thing and then and then we're told these billionaires like bill gates and warren buffett these
[2:28:56.160 --> 2:29:00.960]  these corrupt ones are our saviors but yet all these things are supposed to be kept separate
[2:29:00.960 --> 2:29:06.240]  like the milk and the meat plate they're never supposed to come together into a candidate and
[2:29:06.240 --> 2:29:12.160]  and so that you know it's just it's so foolish for them to think that they exactly the elites aren't
[2:29:12.160 --> 2:29:17.360]  gods they don't control everything napoleon hitler thought they were invincible but world events
[2:29:17.360 --> 2:29:22.400]  is are turning against them and that's a great place to end that call we'll come back uh i'm
[2:29:22.400 --> 2:29:27.040]  going to tell you about something very interesting for a few minutes we're going to give mr stone
[2:29:27.040 --> 2:29:30.960]  about a five minute break and then we're going to come back to him have him comment on what you just
[2:29:30.960 --> 2:29:35.200]  said is history turning against the tyrants his trump is the manifestation of that a bell
[2:29:35.200 --> 2:29:38.480]  weather and then we're going to give him the floor whatever he wants to talk about right
[2:29:38.480 --> 2:29:43.840]  through to the end of the hour uh and more calls as well i'm alex jones with info wars dot com

[2:32:19.120 --> 2:32:24.800]  and thus stop inflammation hi my name is jason i'm 44 years old for 10 years i had been suffering
[2:32:24.800 --> 2:32:30.480]  from chronic pain in my abdomen and groin that radiated down into my feet after three weeks on
[2:32:30.480 --> 2:32:35.440]  one world wave the pain in my feet reduced by 50 percent and the overall pain in my body reduced
[2:32:35.440 --> 2:32:40.560]  significantly as well i ran out of one world weight and the pain returned i got another container
[2:32:40.560 --> 2:32:45.600]  and again after three weeks the pain reduced significantly throughout my body i'd highly
[2:32:45.600 --> 2:32:50.720]  recommend one world weight to anyone dealing with chronic pain due to inflammation call 888

[2:33:03.440 --> 2:33:12.160]  fear is the passion of slaves and this man knows no fear he is alex jones
[2:33:12.160 --> 2:33:19.920]  well they are writing these liners now i'm not and it just sounds how heroic i am
[2:33:21.520 --> 2:33:25.120]  actually i do have some fear a fear of letting these tyrants rule my life
[2:33:25.120 --> 2:33:30.160]  and dominate and totally control me it's fight and flight i've decided to fight so is our guest
[2:33:30.160 --> 2:33:35.520]  roger stone and listen i can't sit here and be wishy wash in a key election like this
[2:33:35.520 --> 2:33:41.920]  and be political like everybody else and just sit back and join the big pillory throwing
[2:33:41.920 --> 2:33:48.720]  tomatoes at donald trump in the proverbial stocks all tied up in the town square he may
[2:33:48.720 --> 2:33:54.720]  not be perfect i may be wrong about all this but they're all piling on what he's saying is true
[2:33:54.720 --> 2:34:03.840]  he's being demonized he's not playing politics as usual that's why i am supporting trump and his
[2:34:03.840 --> 2:34:09.280]  message against the establishment because regardless the things he's saying about our
[2:34:09.280 --> 2:34:15.040]  open borders about gun control about islamic terrorism about taking on isis about uh taxing
[2:34:15.040 --> 2:34:19.360]  the big mega banks but then also setting it up with lower tax rates so they bring their money back
[2:34:19.360 --> 2:34:27.840]  here they probably have a msnbc piece go lower their taxes to tax them to bring it back here yes
[2:34:27.840 --> 2:34:31.840]  they're basically tax exempt the way it's set up right now that's why they wrote these laws
[2:34:31.840 --> 2:34:39.120]  so that's why more and more i'm supporting donald trump just in his message period i'd be happy
[2:34:39.120 --> 2:34:44.400]  with the ted cruiser rand paul and donald trump are a mix of those uh but right now he is the major
[2:34:44.400 --> 2:34:50.560]  frontrunner gaining steam the book the clinton's war on women roger stone now before we go any
[2:34:50.560 --> 2:34:55.200]  further i don't really know cj's view completely uh on trump he's been working here for three or four
[2:34:55.200 --> 2:35:00.320]  years doing a great job running the board and selling the graphics but he's also a technical guy
[2:35:00.320 --> 2:35:04.000]  and i noticed he was really excited about this new product that we're going to spend a few minutes
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:08.160]  on telling you about we've only got a hundred of them private label to have it at the lowest price
[2:35:08.160 --> 2:35:15.760]  out there but this is just the the best vetted technology in solar panels for the price they
[2:35:15.760 --> 2:35:20.080]  give you a wide shot of it of your tv viewer info wars dot com forward slash show of your radio
[2:35:20.080 --> 2:35:26.320]  listener and want to see this but whether it's for your hunting shack or part of your house uh or for
[2:35:26.320 --> 2:35:32.800]  your fishing uh cottage whatever the case is it is mobile like a suit case you can roll around
[2:35:33.680 --> 2:35:39.280]  it's got the solar panels that come with it and the price from what i've seen when i agreed to
[2:35:39.280 --> 2:35:45.360]  order these months ago and do this deal is roughly half of the competitor and they don't even have
[2:35:45.360 --> 2:35:50.160]  as much power and it's not even the best solar panels it's just people keep shelling the stuff
[2:35:50.160 --> 2:35:56.000]  that's 10 years old this is the latest greatest for the price and if this is successful which
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:36:01.440]  i believe it will be able to become a staple of preparedness products that we sell at info wars
[2:36:01.440 --> 2:36:09.520]  store dot com but it is the info war solar base station power supply and cj who's a big fan of it
[2:36:10.080 --> 2:36:15.600]  is here he volunteered to come in and talk about it cj also david knight ran in and pointed out
[2:36:15.600 --> 2:36:20.640]  this you can get a federal tax credit for this system so so describe to us why you're such a
[2:36:20.640 --> 2:36:27.600]  fan of the info or solar base station power supply uh most importantly the benefits i think um i'll
[2:36:27.600 --> 2:36:32.080]  waive in the cost of this uh timber j i'd recommend that i speak about this because i've had some
[2:36:32.080 --> 2:36:38.080]  experience building homebrew solar systems essentially to supplement electrical cost and
[2:36:38.720 --> 2:36:43.520]  it's always been a lot more work than i felt it was worth simply because the cost of the panels
[2:36:44.480 --> 2:36:50.400]  the technology lagging behind in order to get excellent panels of the greatest quality you
[2:36:50.400 --> 2:36:55.680]  need to look at products years in advance and i think what's great about this is it's a monocrystalline
[2:36:55.680 --> 2:37:01.760]  panel instead of a polycrystalline panels which are simply separate pieces of material that absorb
[2:37:02.480 --> 2:37:08.400]  light and convert to energy this is similar to perfect surface copper in electrical terms
[2:37:08.400 --> 2:37:14.960]  you get more more energy or more more efficiency out of a smoother surface and so the panels
[2:37:14.960 --> 2:37:22.080]  themselves are fantastic they're rugged they've got um what looks to be extruded aluminum uh protecting
[2:37:22.080 --> 2:37:28.400]  them they'll fold in half um it's about the size of a large slim suitcase the company that's building
[2:37:28.400 --> 2:37:33.200]  these wants to take over the market they don't want to put crap out not at all um similar uh
[2:37:33.200 --> 2:37:37.600]  pieces of equipment go for about five thousand dollars so i say it's half the cost that's that's
[2:37:37.600 --> 2:37:43.520]  it's it's way way less than half it's it's quite a bit less than half to get something of similar
[2:37:43.520 --> 2:37:48.960]  value and i don't believe they're all in implementing these batteries um the quality of the batteries i
[2:37:48.960 --> 2:37:58.160]  think is is fantastic because it's a lithium iron or lithium ferro um ferrous type cell um it's
[2:37:58.160 --> 2:38:03.600]  it's going to last a lot longer than a lithium polymer or a conventional lithium ion uh it's
[2:38:03.600 --> 2:38:09.040]  discharge rate is going to um be a little bit slower but because of what it is and because
[2:38:09.040 --> 2:38:14.480]  the durability you get a lot more charges and discharges out of this kind of cell uh i think
[2:38:14.480 --> 2:38:19.920]  i believe it's up to two thousand um let's just be clear there's only 98 of these i should say
[2:38:19.920 --> 2:38:24.880]  because i'm getting two of myself i mean this is this is well you got to have this one in your
[2:38:24.880 --> 2:38:30.080]  house is back up and also one portable when you go camping or whatever i mean this is i keep using
[2:38:30.080 --> 2:38:34.640]  the term because that's what i tell my guys i want game changers i want the best reviewed highest
[2:38:34.640 --> 2:38:39.280]  quality bang for your buck companies that are aggressively wanting to dominate markets who
[2:38:39.280 --> 2:38:43.600]  don't just want to be you know sitting on their laurels and the folks we got this from are awesome
[2:38:43.600 --> 2:38:47.760]  we private labeled it to also have this price the leading competitor is why i kept saying
[2:38:47.760 --> 2:38:52.560]  you know twice the cost is twice as much and doesn't even deliver as much power and people
[2:38:52.560 --> 2:38:57.440]  just don't know it's just being marketed and folks are buying it and i'm not being mean we would sell
[2:38:57.440 --> 2:39:03.360]  it we would sell other stuff if it was a good deal i will not sell you something i wouldn't buy
[2:39:03.360 --> 2:39:08.240]  that's all i'm saying tj i immediately thought of my grandmother when i saw it she lives in a
[2:39:08.240 --> 2:39:16.640]  very rural area has c o p d has an oxygen machine has a c-pap and a nebulizer and when the power
[2:39:16.640 --> 2:39:22.400]  goes out they do have a generator it's noisy but it relies on a steady supply of gasoline and if
[2:39:22.400 --> 2:39:26.960]  you're snowed in and you can't get that the sun is still there and what makes it great is that even
[2:39:26.960 --> 2:39:33.280]  in overcast situations like you'll find in winter it's going to absorb almost as much as a conventional
[2:39:33.280 --> 2:39:40.240]  solar panel on a cloudy day wow other specs about the new info or solar base station power supply
[2:39:40.240 --> 2:39:48.480]  and info or store dot com along with an ac outlet you've got 12 volt outlets um 12 volts at um i
[2:39:48.480 --> 2:39:54.160]  believe 20 amps so you can charge a car if you don't have a portable charger you and you have this
[2:39:54.160 --> 2:39:59.040]  in your car for example while traveling going hunting camping fishing and you need to charge a
[2:39:59.040 --> 2:40:05.680]  battery it's capable of that um it does come with that led work lamp um which in the event of darkness
[2:40:05.680 --> 2:40:10.720]  you've got a full battery and you needed to work on something um you've got light available it would
[2:40:10.720 --> 2:40:16.640]  be and a lot of panels fold together and and fits so nicely for transportability as well
[2:40:16.640 --> 2:40:20.640]  and durability it's it's got a protective casing around it most of the panels that i purchased in
[2:40:20.640 --> 2:40:26.160]  the past were very fragile you basically set them up somewhere and try not to touch them again
[2:40:26.160 --> 2:40:34.720]  uh because they're subject to cracking uh this is very very sturdy well i hope that you'll work
[2:40:34.720 --> 2:40:40.000]  with the guys since you're so knowledgeable about this um i know tim spent years for years i said
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:44.960]  get me the best small portable solar unit and we would just look at reviews or find out well what
[2:40:44.960 --> 2:40:50.880]  we could get and it just it just had too many problems too many issues we finally found something
[2:40:50.880 --> 2:40:56.720]  that i can really get behind and the price is so low it's it's so high quality for for people that
[2:40:56.720 --> 2:41:02.080]  want to really have portable power uh these are amazing units and it's something not just for
[2:41:02.080 --> 2:41:08.160]  preparedness but just for everyday life uh it's very very very very very exciting it is uh forever
[2:41:08.160 --> 2:41:12.560]  day life you can put one of these in your house and in some states you qualify for a tax credit
[2:41:12.560 --> 2:41:18.000]  up to 30 of the cost um some states would require that you somehow permanently attach it or hire
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:22.960]  an electrician to run the leads in it's not necessary and for safety to hire an electrician
[2:41:22.960 --> 2:41:28.080]  for the dc leads being that it's dc low voltage it's not a huge fire risk but in order to qualify
[2:41:28.080 --> 2:41:32.800]  for a tax credit you may want to look into it contact an accountant but um even for home use if
[2:41:32.800 --> 2:41:38.800]  you'd like to shave maybe a few dozen dollars off of your electric bill i think it would be quite
[2:41:38.800 --> 2:41:43.760]  effective absolutely so if you did use this over a year or so you'd get your money back
[2:41:43.760 --> 2:41:48.400]  more than likely you'd certainly get the peace of mind back that's that's certain
[2:41:48.960 --> 2:41:52.480]  uh i think it's the most innovative uh thing we've we've decided to release in our store
[2:41:52.480 --> 2:41:57.920]  since the gsock shock watches i carry one because we work in broadcast and well that's a no brainer
[2:41:57.920 --> 2:42:01.520]  i mean they're really high quality watches that are super tough and everybody loves it's it's
[2:42:01.520 --> 2:42:07.600]  military grade it receives perfect time six times a day shortwave and um i feel naked without it
[2:42:07.600 --> 2:42:12.240]  being in radio and all the special forces guys have them because they are the best we have
[2:42:12.240 --> 2:42:16.160]  them discounted in four store dot com and it is your purchasing that makes it all possible we have
[2:42:16.160 --> 2:42:21.200]  free shipping in the store uh until december 18th and we've got a bunch of specials running right
[2:42:21.200 --> 2:42:27.280]  now at info wars life dot com info or store dot com but this is definitely a great christmas gift
[2:42:27.280 --> 2:42:31.760]  to your family uh to yourself to your loved ones uh and to others but i mean obviously you don't
[2:42:31.760 --> 2:42:36.000]  want to buy this for your son or daughter if they're not somewhat technical it's super easy to use
[2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:38.960]  but uh you know people aren't into this type of stuff and you probably don't want to give it to
[2:42:38.960 --> 2:42:43.680]  them but how many people do you know that are into preparedness or are into hunting or are into
[2:42:43.680 --> 2:42:48.720]  being off the grid uh this really is uh innovative and it's great to see the technology getting
[2:42:48.720 --> 2:42:53.600]  better and better and so much more stable the system is really worried about ubiquitous use of
[2:42:53.600 --> 2:42:57.280]  solar panels as they get better and better coming out that's why they're trying to force people to
[2:42:57.280 --> 2:43:03.280]  dial them in to the central power grid uh is so they can control the whole thing uh this is about
[2:43:03.280 --> 2:43:07.920]  decentralization cj thank you so much you're welcome thank you all right there goes cj folks
[2:43:07.920 --> 2:43:14.320]  we're going to go back now uh to our guests the clinton's war on women roger stone uh
[2:43:14.960 --> 2:43:20.560]  and we're going to be getting him on uh to talk more about that and to talk about the
[2:43:20.560 --> 2:43:28.480]  caller's last question is there a major political realignment happening and we do know that there
[2:43:28.480 --> 2:43:36.800]  is a major political uh realignment that is taking place and so everything we see out there
[2:43:36.800 --> 2:43:43.520]  is about scrambling political discourse creating racial and religious divisions to to to keep all
[2:43:43.520 --> 2:43:50.160]  that stirred up uh so going back to roger stone roger you heard the caller earlier he was saying
[2:43:50.160 --> 2:43:54.640]  he thinks that the political elite now used to have the mightest touch because they had america's
[2:43:54.640 --> 2:44:00.720]  goodwill behind us uh they had uh the world believing what we said even if we weren't perfect
[2:44:00.720 --> 2:44:05.440]  we've lost that moral high ground now and the world doesn't believe our elite even when they tell
[2:44:05.440 --> 2:44:12.080]  the truth but that old quote i forget who said it uh for who the gods would destroy they would
[2:44:12.080 --> 2:44:19.040]  first make mad and i know that's kind of attributed to a lot of different historians but it does seem
[2:44:19.040 --> 2:44:25.120]  as if our elite are degenerating quickly can you speak to the political climate worldwide as an
[2:44:25.120 --> 2:44:30.400]  expert as an advisor to so many presidents and and and and where you see the world going and
[2:44:30.400 --> 2:44:36.240]  what you would expect donald trump to do if he was elected president well this is pretty simple
[2:44:36.240 --> 2:44:40.880]  the countries around the world are looking to see whether we're going to continue to be patsies
[2:44:40.880 --> 2:44:46.640]  whether we're going to be china's bitch when it comes to trade or japan's or mexico uh they're
[2:44:46.640 --> 2:44:53.120]  going to see if our military is going to continue to be allowed to atrophy uh and get to the point
[2:44:53.120 --> 2:44:58.320]  where we can barely defend ourselves they're going to see whether this printing press monetary system
[2:44:58.320 --> 2:45:03.680]  of ours will continue to destroy our dollar they're going to see whether uh we are going
[2:45:03.680 --> 2:45:08.960]  to continue to go deeper and deeper and deeper into debt they're going to see whether we keep
[2:45:08.960 --> 2:45:13.920]  spending like drunken sailors and by the way here's a bipartisan problem republicans and
[2:45:13.920 --> 2:45:20.320]  democrats together responsible when the republicans held the house under george w bush and a republican
[2:45:20.320 --> 2:45:27.920]  administration their record on spending would make franklin roosevelt blush uh so it's it is uh
[2:45:27.920 --> 2:45:32.560]  you know there is disgust with the two-party system on the other hand alexa must tell you
[2:45:32.560 --> 2:45:37.040]  i was very proud to say that i helped former governor gary johnson who i know has been on
[2:45:37.040 --> 2:45:42.720]  with you many times get on the ballot in 48 states uh because the american people were ready for
[2:45:42.720 --> 2:45:48.240]  something new 70 percent of the people in the polls in that election told us that they wished
[2:45:48.240 --> 2:45:53.920]  there was another choice and of course there was another choice he was the two-term accomplished
[2:45:53.920 --> 2:46:03.360]  tax cutting pro growth pro peace pro pot governor of uh of new mexico and of course the presidential
[2:46:03.360 --> 2:46:09.840]  commission on debates which is not appointed by the president not a commission and most certainly
[2:46:09.840 --> 2:46:16.240]  not about debate was determined to keep this man off the stage what if people knew there was a
[2:46:16.240 --> 2:46:22.320]  candidate who wanted to bring all who wanted to repeal the patriot act or who wanted to bring all
[2:46:22.320 --> 2:46:28.240]  of our troops home from afghanistan the meat grinder uh who wanted to legalize marijuana
[2:46:28.240 --> 2:46:33.440]  and tax it uh what would have happened if people knew that guy was in the race so i'm very
[2:46:33.440 --> 2:46:38.000]  joined us about the system trump has chosen to make his stand within the republican party
[2:46:38.720 --> 2:46:44.320]  and i am with him uh and if he is the republican nominee i'm going to do everything personally
[2:46:44.320 --> 2:46:51.440]  possible i want to be very clear i have no formal or informal role in his campaign we are friends
[2:46:51.440 --> 2:46:56.560]  it's that simple i am not compensated i'm very interested in selling the clinton's war on women
[2:46:56.560 --> 2:47:02.480]  because i think it is the information alex that trump is going to need i think there's several
[2:47:02.480 --> 2:47:07.760]  ways to take hillary down uh and that's a whole broader discussion that you and i need to have
[2:47:08.320 --> 2:47:11.440]  i want you to get into any other facets we haven't raised obviously because i've been
[2:47:11.440 --> 2:47:15.840]  directing things you've got a lot more gravitas on the political inside workings i'd like to
[2:47:15.840 --> 2:47:21.680]  hear that with your perspective but separately let's expand on this my big fear has always been
[2:47:22.240 --> 2:47:26.800]  and and i believe you you know off air and others saying no trump you probably won't do that but
[2:47:26.800 --> 2:47:31.440]  the republicans have betrayed him he said as long as the republicans don't attack me and don't demonize
[2:47:31.440 --> 2:47:38.080]  me and don't call for me to step down i will pledge to stay in the republican uh you know primary
[2:47:38.080 --> 2:47:43.520]  well obviously that's got the machine the muscle that's a smart move now he's saying hey i may leave
[2:47:43.520 --> 2:47:48.000]  if you keep trying to basically politically assassinate me and they spend that like he's
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:53.120]  breaking a pledge no i remember what his pledge was he's not breaking the pledge but specifically
[2:47:53.120 --> 2:48:00.080]  still i know he's probably just trying to leverage him correct me if i'm wrong but but uh he shouldn't
[2:48:00.080 --> 2:48:05.840]  let them kick him out or run him out uh what is trump really saying about that i mean what's the
[2:48:05.840 --> 2:48:10.720]  real trump gonna do very unlikely that he will have to run as an independent therefore when
[2:48:10.720 --> 2:48:17.200]  people ask me about it uh it it's a it's a it's a it's a mcguffin in all honesty at this point
[2:48:17.200 --> 2:48:22.800]  does he have the name id and the financial resources to do that yes so let's put it in
[2:48:22.800 --> 2:48:28.480]  perspective because uh my friend richard reeves is i think uh very concerned about this if they play
[2:48:28.480 --> 2:48:34.880]  the kind of shenanigans with the rules at the convention or in any part of the process that
[2:48:34.880 --> 2:48:42.080]  they used uh to cheat ron paul out of his fair share of delegates and his say at the convention
[2:48:42.080 --> 2:48:47.840]  where he was a nonperson they wouldn't even call his name in the role the official role of the
[2:48:47.840 --> 2:48:53.680]  convention even when he had legally won delegates uh what kind of graciousness is that on the part
[2:48:53.680 --> 2:48:59.360]  of uh mit romney who had the votes to be nominated at that time if they move to keep trump out of
[2:48:59.360 --> 2:49:07.440]  debates if they move to keep him off the ballot which some republican secretary of states can do
[2:49:07.440 --> 2:49:12.960]  that i think under that circumstances it may be the only uh uh root for him to the white house
[2:49:13.760 --> 2:49:18.640]  and therefore in my opinion to the potential salvation this country because no one else
[2:49:18.640 --> 2:49:26.080]  is going to really change things the the the the two-party duopoly the bush clinton war machine
[2:49:26.080 --> 2:49:32.480]  profiteering machine will continue to try to curtail our civil liberties uh and make money off of
[2:49:32.480 --> 2:49:37.760]  i am now completely sold i mean mr stone you always have the right answer you've back so many
[2:49:37.760 --> 2:49:44.640]  great candidates it's so good to see a political analyst who actually is telling the truth that's
[2:49:44.640 --> 2:49:50.160]  it the only time trump should run third party is if they cheat him in the delegate process and have
[2:49:50.160 --> 2:49:57.200]  jeb bush in there then who wouldn't want trump to run fine hillary or jeb it's time to go after
[2:49:57.200 --> 2:50:01.280]  both of them you've got the books out on them i kind of see a pincer attack here i kind of
[2:50:01.280 --> 2:50:06.800]  see some planning behind the scenes uh that will really give them a run for their money
[2:50:06.800 --> 2:50:11.280]  and it's good to see some guys with brains you and trump really giving these criminals a run for
[2:50:11.280 --> 2:50:17.360]  their money well look i think uh hillary clinton is going to be very very formidable alex and uh
[2:50:17.360 --> 2:50:22.080]  she's going to have an enormous amount of wall street money the idea of her ever reigning in
[2:50:22.080 --> 2:50:30.240]  wall street is laughable uh and she and her husband have many many uh uh let's call them assets in the
[2:50:30.240 --> 2:50:37.040]  media uh who are uh you know who uh go to great lengths to cover up all of their blemishes uh
[2:50:37.040 --> 2:50:42.960]  their many blemishes uh and their outright criminal record their record of lies deception
[2:50:42.960 --> 2:50:51.920]  drugs sexual assault cover up lies upon more lies upon more lies only uh today i saw a video in
[2:50:51.920 --> 2:51:00.800]  which hillary clinton is now attempting to say that she never claimed that a an anti-islamic
[2:51:00.800 --> 2:51:09.040]  video shown one time in turkey uh had caused a uh the attack on the american mission in ben gazi
[2:51:09.040 --> 2:51:13.360]  i wrote a book on this uh for sky horse it's a short book but if you want to know
[2:51:13.360 --> 2:51:19.120]  what hillary did wrong in ben gazi go to amazon and buy my book on ben gazi i took the senate report
[2:51:19.120 --> 2:51:23.360]  uh but i gave you a roadmap uh up front that explained what the senate report was saying
[2:51:23.360 --> 2:51:28.160]  and what it showed you it's uh i think it makes the case that hillary lied about that now she's
[2:51:28.160 --> 2:51:34.320]  out on the campaign trail and she says to her stooge george steppin operas donor to the clinton
[2:51:34.320 --> 2:51:40.480]  foundation but interviewing her on television therefore posing as a journalist uh when she's
[2:51:40.480 --> 2:51:46.800]  asked did you say that this was tied to a video she said no that's a that's a horrific i mean
[2:51:46.800 --> 2:51:51.600]  that's as bad as obama saying he never said that you could keep your doctor i mean this is a new
[2:51:51.600 --> 2:51:57.520]  level of lying no no and the families for the four immediately contacted the family of the parents of
[2:51:57.520 --> 2:52:05.600]  the four brave americans who were who were murdered uh in ben gazi and lost their lives uh the parents
[2:52:05.600 --> 2:52:11.360]  are outraged because that is not what she looked in the eye and told them so we know everybody had
[2:52:11.360 --> 2:52:18.960]  this great celebration about her hearings and how terrific how she was before the senate uh i think
[2:52:18.960 --> 2:52:25.360]  that that is um uh not true i think that she was caught in more and more big lies for example
[2:52:25.360 --> 2:52:32.720]  uh this notion that she emailed the egyptian ambassador and her own daughter chelsea uh
[2:52:33.520 --> 2:52:39.760]  after the attack saying we've been attacked by al-qaeda when she's telling the world this cover
[2:52:39.760 --> 2:52:46.960]  story about an islamic video which is uh essentially a cover-up because they didn't want to admit in
[2:52:46.960 --> 2:52:54.000]  the run up to the presidential election that was only weeks away that they had uh uh that american
[2:52:54.000 --> 2:52:59.440]  interests had been attacked by a group affiliated with al-qaeda and four americans had lost their
[2:52:59.440 --> 2:53:05.120]  lives that would be handing the election to mitt romney and that's precisely what they feared in this
[2:53:05.120 --> 2:53:10.320]  intermural you see these are different factions of the establishment this is how bush runs against
[2:53:10.320 --> 2:53:16.560]  clinton it's not republican democrat it's their it's their different factions of an aristocracy
[2:53:16.560 --> 2:53:20.480]  yeah it's like the harvard lacrosse team playing the other harvard lacrosse team
[2:53:20.480 --> 2:53:24.320]  well the rockefellers and the kennedys both wanted power and they wanted to be the guy
[2:53:24.320 --> 2:53:30.320]  don't think that they weren't fighting inside the club uh and the guys in the club like henry
[2:53:30.320 --> 2:53:37.360]  luce and uh and tom dewey and other king makers are choosing sides uh avril herriman
[2:53:38.080 --> 2:53:43.040]  prescott bush and you can see the whole sniveling snot knows establishment against donald trump
[2:53:43.040 --> 2:53:47.760]  and at first i said could this be fake but it's obviously real it's obviously happening he will
[2:53:47.760 --> 2:53:52.080]  be destroyed uh to a great extent if he doesn't win he knows that he says what i'm gonna do go
[2:53:52.080 --> 2:53:56.800]  watch tv he's he's being banned off television he's losing a bunch of his big franchises
[2:53:56.800 --> 2:54:00.880]  he's losing hundreds of millions of dollars every few weeks here and there everybody just
[2:54:00.880 --> 2:54:05.920]  and he told me just this morning that he doesn't care i mean this shows i i said donald this has
[2:54:05.920 --> 2:54:10.720]  got to be hurting your bottom line he said yeah i've had some deals go south but you know i don't
[2:54:10.720 --> 2:54:16.960]  really care uh this guy is a patriot and he sees that this country desperately needs leadership
[2:54:16.960 --> 2:54:23.760]  uh he knows that the that the career politicians are never going to do anything other than talk
[2:54:23.760 --> 2:54:29.760]  trump has a can do confidence that people haven't seen well he clearly loves the fight
[2:54:30.480 --> 2:54:34.880]  he's having the time of his life and you know watching him be silly and stuff on other tv shows
[2:54:34.880 --> 2:54:38.960]  entertainment you know it's just you know he's having fun but once he gets in the fight uh you
[2:54:38.960 --> 2:54:46.160]  can really see that uh it's just good to see that male uh stamina uh you're not the fake slimy type
[2:54:46.160 --> 2:54:51.040]  we normally see but the real deal loving the fight not caring committed to the fight not worried if
[2:54:51.040 --> 2:54:54.560]  he gets caught up uh that's why they're so scared of him it's beautiful i want to take a few phone
[2:54:54.560 --> 2:55:01.920]  calls here we got kevin jeff erica monique in canada kevin and so many others uh let's go to uh
[2:55:01.920 --> 2:55:10.000]  monique in canada monique you're on the air with roger stone go ahead hi i'm uh i'm reading many of
[2:55:10.000 --> 2:55:15.120]  your channel and different channels because i'm on defending the kids for the books they're pushing
[2:55:15.120 --> 2:55:20.960]  in the schools yes i even had a legal restriction on me given one year because i complained books
[2:55:20.960 --> 2:55:26.960]  that were for 12 plus given to nine years old so um yeah canada under political correctness
[2:55:26.960 --> 2:55:32.320]  has a lot of censorship what's your take on the donald trump situation um i'm reading about lots
[2:55:32.320 --> 2:55:38.640]  in the french medias and stuff they're they're pushing that there's an international boy boycott
[2:55:38.640 --> 2:55:46.800]  of protest organizing against trump because they're pushing the medias are pushing that trump
[2:55:46.800 --> 2:55:53.040]  says things against the muslims and against the israelis so there is there is a there is a global
[2:55:53.040 --> 2:55:58.640]  movement now by the socialists and the big billionaires to crush donald trump which again
[2:55:59.200 --> 2:56:03.520]  everybody's even libertarians seem about to be destroyed they think they go i'm against trump
[2:56:03.520 --> 2:56:08.800]  like that's the manly you know of you know i'm behind trump now in his dark hour that's what
[2:56:08.800 --> 2:56:14.000]  you've got to do if somebody's for real i appreciate your call uh is it this kind of backfire there's
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:21.040]  a major danger roger that they're making him the underdog correct yeah alex i i frankly think that
[2:56:21.040 --> 2:56:26.320]  the fundamental question here uh is they're trying to this canard that bush is some that
[2:56:26.320 --> 2:56:31.680]  trump is somehow recruited by bill clinton and in league with the clinton's i can tell you
[2:56:31.680 --> 2:56:37.440]  having known him this long and having been around and witnessed firsthand by the way
[2:56:37.440 --> 2:56:43.360]  hillary wanted to come to donald's wedding her staff tried to overrule her and she insisted
[2:56:43.360 --> 2:56:49.040]  on coming to donald's wedding he is the wealthiest man in the state of new york most likely
[2:56:49.040 --> 2:56:56.160]  she was the u.s senator uh from uh from uh uh from new york uh you can imagine the gliderati
[2:56:56.160 --> 2:57:02.720]  that was at trump's uh a wedding uh so she wanted to attend hillary there were some hot chicks there
[2:57:02.720 --> 2:57:08.800]  dolly no i'm sure it was a c and b seen thing and hillary went because it was a political coup
[2:57:08.800 --> 2:57:15.040]  for her trump is a very popular man in his home state so uh so but the notion that he is in the
[2:57:15.040 --> 2:57:21.760]  tank which jab is trying to push that's nonsense the other notion that that i think is similar
[2:57:21.760 --> 2:57:28.160]  course is that some people draw parallels between ross perot and trump i knew perot uh and i knew
[2:57:28.160 --> 2:57:34.240]  his people uh and i think they put on a very valiant fight with a lot of uh amateurs uh but uh
[2:57:34.880 --> 2:57:40.640]  perot as you know threatened the status quo as trump did he was an independent billionaire as
[2:57:40.640 --> 2:57:45.360]  trump is he would have brought real reform to washington he was neither left nor right in the
[2:57:45.360 --> 2:57:50.720]  sense that he was a populist with conservative but they threatened to kill his family so he got out
[2:57:50.720 --> 2:57:56.800]  so he fold it now uh trump wouldn't do that i can't see trump doing that trump is uh he's already
[2:57:56.800 --> 2:58:03.120]  got secret service protection uh he is uh he along with ben carson because they are controversial
[2:58:03.120 --> 2:58:09.680]  figures uh and that is appointed by the president uh they have their own personal security which we
[2:58:09.680 --> 2:58:15.840]  of course cannot talk about uh but i trump's not a quitter he's not a folder and he certainly
[2:58:15.840 --> 2:58:23.360]  won't be bullied out of this race he is uh he's a shrewd uh individual uh and he will assess the race
[2:58:23.360 --> 2:58:28.320]  and he will be a candidate as long as he is viable i frankly think that he will win before that time
[2:58:28.320 --> 2:58:32.080]  i would hope that's the case i know you've got to go soon do five more minutes with us
[2:58:32.080 --> 2:58:37.840]  rogerstonestonezone.com get the book i want to i want to ask you why he thinks with the numbers
[2:58:37.840 --> 2:58:45.200]  why he thinks trump can win this is important stay with us gcn visit gcmi.com today then leon

[3:08:47.440 --> 3:08:52.640]  but we're going to talk about a lot of stuff and the good news is there's actually no such thing
[3:08:52.640 --> 3:09:00.080]  by the way as internet censorship in china according to china china's top sensor actually just
[3:09:00.080 --> 3:09:04.640]  released a statement the senior chinese official known as the gatekeeper of the country's internet
[3:09:04.640 --> 3:09:09.680]  has denied that the country censors online information lou way chief of state internet
[3:09:09.680 --> 3:09:15.440]  information office said china does not censor but manages internet content so i have good news for
[3:09:15.440 --> 3:09:20.800]  you there's no such thing as internet censorship in the united states either or in the world just
[3:09:20.800 --> 3:09:27.600]  anywhere at all it's only managed so when you go to post something online it's blocked or it's
[3:09:27.600 --> 3:09:32.000]  taken down on youtube or facebook or whatever that's actually not censorship good news guys
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:38.160]  that's just managed content the government manages it to keep you safe so that's some
[3:09:38.160 --> 3:09:42.160]  uplifting news but no seriously we're going to get into some other news about petition to ban
[3:09:42.160 --> 3:09:47.520]  trump from the uk passes 250k signatures could he be actually banned in the united kingdom
[3:09:47.520 --> 3:09:51.200]  i wonder if that would still hold if he's president that would be interesting google says it has
[3:09:51.200 --> 3:09:55.600]  proved its controversial quantum computer really works and it could do math better than a conventional
[3:09:55.600 --> 3:10:00.320]  computer anonymous couple drops five hundred thousand dollars into a salvation army kettle
[3:10:00.320 --> 3:10:04.880]  outside of a small restaurant we're gonna talk about how putin we spoke about this a little
[3:10:04.880 --> 3:10:09.920]  bit earlier but we're going to expand on how he's going to become a non-gmo dominant exporter
[3:10:09.920 --> 3:10:16.640]  and in kazakhstan the internet backdoors you they want to install some type of a chip or
[3:10:16.640 --> 3:10:21.360]  software i'll have to read into it and where it tracks everything on your personal devices
[3:10:21.360 --> 3:10:24.960]  this is kind of like a beta test of what some people want to do in the united states
[3:10:24.960 --> 3:10:30.400]  where every single thing you do on your personal device whether it's a cell phone or a computer
[3:10:30.400 --> 3:10:36.160]  or a lap you know ipad or whatever it all goes through the government cloud and it tracks everything
[3:10:36.160 --> 3:10:41.600]  you look up everything you are interested in everything you like everything you do just tracks
[3:10:41.600 --> 3:10:47.520]  you 100 completely we also have some uplifting news but dr group is going to talk to us about
[3:10:47.520 --> 3:10:53.360]  some really really important health information on detoxing on avoiding the average of five
[3:10:53.360 --> 3:10:59.520]  pounds that we all gain during the holidays right and some of the reasons that were secretly
[3:10:59.520 --> 3:11:03.440]  you know unknowingly packing on the weight feeling like crap over the holidays when we
[3:11:03.440 --> 3:11:08.320]  can actually do about it so yeah now you know coming knowing i was going to be on the show
[3:11:08.320 --> 3:11:13.440]  today i was like what can i do for people the holidays are coming up you know sometimes i come
[3:11:13.440 --> 3:11:18.960]  on the show we promote the products which are great but i really want to give back to everybody and
[3:11:18.960 --> 3:11:24.560]  just say put together a lot of facts and put together some tips that everybody can learn
[3:11:24.560 --> 3:11:28.160]  about the holidays and what they can do to be healthy during the holidays how they can replace
[3:11:28.160 --> 3:11:33.040]  some of the toxic foods with some natural foods how they can reduce their stress levels over the
[3:11:33.040 --> 3:11:38.400]  holidays because i know they're probably going to have parents and you know mother-in-laws and
[3:11:38.400 --> 3:11:44.560]  everything coming in so it's not only having a non-toxic holiday season but it's also you know
[3:11:44.560 --> 3:11:50.080]  how do you deal with all this stuff that's going on and so i put together uh some things that i'd
[3:11:50.080 --> 3:11:54.880]  like to share with everybody a few years ago consumers consumer reports did a survey on what
[3:11:54.880 --> 3:12:03.200]  americans dread the most about the holidays they dread the most going in debt dealing with crowds
[3:12:03.200 --> 3:12:10.480]  and gaining weight and according to the national cancer of health statistics over 30 of american
[3:12:10.480 --> 3:12:15.680]  adults are overweight another 30 or obese so in other words they dread the very thing they are
[3:12:15.680 --> 3:12:20.560]  just as much as going into debt that's that's pretty hardcore gaining five pounds is just as
[3:12:20.560 --> 3:12:25.200]  bad as going into debt right the new england journal of medicine says the average person gains at
[3:12:25.200 --> 3:12:32.720]  least one pound each year between thanksgiving and new years and usually up to five pounds i know
[3:12:32.720 --> 3:12:39.840]  everybody's interested out in uh not being able to gain those that weight and when you look at the
[3:12:39.840 --> 3:12:45.360]  thanksgiving the christmas holidays really it starts around halloween when you get all the candy
[3:12:45.360 --> 3:12:50.080]  and you start slowing down because wintertime starts coming in and it's fun though too like
[3:12:50.080 --> 3:12:53.600]  i definitely don't think what we're saying is oh you can't enjoy yourself you can't have these
[3:12:53.600 --> 3:12:59.440]  things instead it's just these little secret kind of attacks these incognito health threats
[3:12:59.440 --> 3:13:03.440]  that we don't realize that are in all of this stuff that we can easily get rid of and you can
[3:13:03.440 --> 3:13:06.960]  still enjoy yourself still have fun which i'm all about you know enjoying yourself in the holidays
[3:13:06.960 --> 3:13:12.400]  but not destroying your body not gaining five to ten pounds and saying oh god why did i do that
[3:13:12.400 --> 3:13:16.320]  it's not actually that hard yeah because come january when you have your new year's resolution
[3:13:16.320 --> 3:13:22.320]  you'd be like wow i actually lost two pounds over the holidays right so what i looked at was
[3:13:22.320 --> 3:13:26.480]  you know what are the most common toxic substances that people are going to be exposed to
[3:13:26.480 --> 3:13:33.440]  over the holidays number one is beverages and that's going to be your uh coffee mixes your egg
[3:13:33.440 --> 3:13:42.000]  nog your out different alcoholic drinks different types of cocktails soda egg nog for example now
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:47.680]  personally i don't drink egg nog i used to as a kid i liked it and sometimes i'll buy like the
[3:13:47.680 --> 3:13:53.280]  coconut egg nog for the kids or whatever but i was amazed to find out that traditional egg nog is
[3:13:53.280 --> 3:14:01.840]  basically cream sugar white sugar and eggs and one sixteen ounce serving of egg nog contains
[3:14:01.840 --> 3:14:12.480]  500 to 800 calories and 40 grams of fat one 16 ounce serving that's without any alcohol added
[3:14:12.480 --> 3:14:18.720]  and that's the equivalent of you eating four glazed donuts and i don't know about you guys but i
[3:14:18.720 --> 3:14:23.680]  picture everyone drinking about five of those 16 ounce glasses of egg nog everyone just chugs it
[3:14:23.680 --> 3:14:28.480]  all day with brandy and wake up in the morning let's have some egg nog you know and put a little
[3:14:28.480 --> 3:14:32.800]  brandy in there and just drink it throughout the day it's pretty much the football game is coming on
[3:14:32.800 --> 3:14:37.760]  the food's starting to come out you're starting to get your egg nog you're you're adding the brandy
[3:14:37.760 --> 3:14:43.600]  in there yeah it's pretty bad so i'll tell you a natural replacement for egg nog is if you go to
[3:14:43.600 --> 3:14:49.360]  your natural or organic food store and you can get it's still high in sugar but it's still gonna be
[3:14:49.360 --> 3:14:54.960]  better for you coconut egg nog almond milk egg nog they make it in like a chocolate mint and they
[3:14:54.960 --> 3:15:00.480]  make it in in different flavors or better than that just don't even drink the egg nog and just
[3:15:00.480 --> 3:15:08.560]  utilize water which is another thing that people get dehydrated over the holiday season with all
[3:15:08.560 --> 3:15:13.680]  the alcohol and all these sugary drinks to dehydrate you so one of my recommendations too over the
[3:15:13.680 --> 3:15:22.400]  holidays just make a conscious effort to try to drink more water you know just get one of the glass
[3:15:22.400 --> 3:15:26.640]  water containers and fill it up and just tell yourself you're going to drink two or three of
[3:15:26.640 --> 3:15:35.760]  those a day the next thing i have on the list is the sugary drinks and sugar in general for example
[3:15:35.760 --> 3:15:42.640]  a 16 ounce peppermint white chocolate mocha from starbucks contains syrups whip cream and chocolate
[3:15:42.640 --> 3:15:48.960]  that adds up to 500 calories and 76 grams of sugar if you just get rid of the drinks that you're
[3:15:48.960 --> 3:15:53.760]  having on a daily basis and replace it with water or just something that's not complete junk you'll
[3:15:53.760 --> 3:16:00.240]  realize that is about i'd say 70% of people don't realize all of the toxic matter they're taking
[3:16:00.240 --> 3:16:04.000]  in and the extra calories and they're getting fat is because of the drinks yeah because i was i was
[3:16:04.000 --> 3:16:08.240]  looking at all these things and i was just amazed because i know i mean i have family members and i
[3:16:08.240 --> 3:16:12.480]  have people in my office unfortunately that you know really get into the christmas spirit and
[3:16:12.480 --> 3:16:19.280]  the spirit and they you know they're coming in with their venti mocha peppermint mocha lattes and
[3:16:19.280 --> 3:16:24.800]  stuff and which have more calories than a cheeseburger believe it or not mega doses of sugar
[3:16:24.800 --> 3:16:30.960]  and milk and you know they're sweeteners and stuff if you get one of those um vanilla mocha
[3:16:30.960 --> 3:16:35.200]  frappuccinos or whatever it is it's oftentimes like 2000 calories it's like sitting down eating an
[3:16:35.200 --> 3:16:39.600]  entire entree at a restaurant and people just drink it all day because you don't see the label
[3:16:39.600 --> 3:16:44.160]  you don't actually care and you know i want you to keep going it also reminds me of this though
[3:16:44.160 --> 3:16:48.320]  putin wants russia to become world's biggest exporter of non-jima food but that's not even the
[3:16:48.320 --> 3:16:53.120]  most important part what most people that are covering this haven't realized is perhaps the
[3:16:53.120 --> 3:17:00.240]  biggest part is putin says in this statement the same one that the western food supply is basically
[3:17:00.240 --> 3:17:06.240]  crap he says we are not only able to feed ourselves taking into account our lands water resources
[3:17:06.240 --> 3:17:10.400]  russia is able to become the largest world supplier of healthy ecologically clean and high
[3:17:10.400 --> 3:17:16.560]  quality food this is the important part which the western producers have long lost especially
[3:17:16.560 --> 3:17:20.640]  given the fact that demand for such products in the world market is steadily growing so he says
[3:17:21.280 --> 3:17:26.160]  they have clean food they have ecologically clean food they have real organic food and high quality
[3:17:26.160 --> 3:17:33.040]  food which the western producers have long lost so isn't it interesting that a world leader putin
[3:17:33.040 --> 3:17:38.240]  who many would say should really be time magazine man of the year in some ways because of many
[3:17:38.240 --> 3:17:43.600]  different fronts because of his massive publicity and he's kind of outshined obama in many ways
[3:17:43.600 --> 3:17:49.600]  is saying that the western food supply is essentially dead dead of devoid of any high
[3:17:49.600 --> 3:17:55.360]  quality ecologically clean and healthy food devoid of any good organic food and he says
[3:17:55.920 --> 3:18:01.200]  that russia is going to step up and become the number one exporter of non-gmo organic food
[3:18:01.200 --> 3:18:07.920]  this is from rt russia today that is his pivotal point in saying the western food supply is so
[3:18:07.920 --> 3:18:12.960]  dead that he's going to step up and take it over is that not a huge tech and a glaring reality
[3:18:12.960 --> 3:18:19.760]  that our food supply is so destroyed that putin from russia is going to come in and say that the
[3:18:19.760 --> 3:18:26.240]  us has lost it and he's going to have a main point of his entire really career seems like
[3:18:26.240 --> 3:18:31.040]  be the fact that they have real food again is that not the final testament of everything
[3:18:31.040 --> 3:18:35.280]  we're saying is true all those so-called people saying oh well it's actually fine and the
[3:18:35.280 --> 3:18:40.160]  research has been clear everything is fine i mean come on so a foreign a foreign leader has to come
[3:18:40.160 --> 3:18:45.200]  in and retake our food supply for us well maybe people wake up and listen you know a bunch of
[3:18:45.200 --> 3:18:50.480]  people are sweating bullets right now throughout monsanto and throughout our government and throughout
[3:18:50.480 --> 3:18:57.600]  the usda and the fda i mean listen uh we should have done that a long time ago we should have never
[3:18:57.600 --> 3:19:02.400]  allowed all these chemicals and genetically modified foods i mean it's great that one country
[3:19:02.400 --> 3:19:05.920]  stepping up it's great that most of the other countries around the world but it's horrible
[3:19:05.920 --> 3:19:09.600]  and russia has to come in and tell us that our food supply is dead we should know that we should
[3:19:09.600 --> 3:19:17.120]  be taking steps but it just shows the dead just not even in competency but the unwillingness to
[3:19:17.120 --> 3:19:22.640]  act on the us politician side as the corporation is just loot and pillage everything i mean everything
[3:19:22.640 --> 3:19:26.720]  you're reading on there is not because people are stupid how dare you not know that you're

[3:24:39.440 --> 3:24:45.920]  chosen chosen people 2014 were the ebola fighters the medical professionals who battled the disease
[3:24:45.920 --> 3:24:51.200]  in africa and elsewhere for quote tireless acts of courage and mercy for buying the world time
[3:24:51.200 --> 3:25:00.000]  to boost its defenses 2013 was pope francis for the first non-european pope in 1200 years poised
[3:25:00.000 --> 3:25:08.000]  to transform a place that measures changed by the century 2012 was president obama and 2011
[3:25:08.000 --> 3:25:15.040]  was the protesters era of spring and 2010 was mark zuckerberg and again this year is angela
[3:25:15.040 --> 3:25:20.640]  merkel i want to hear your take on who you would choose if you had the ability as the person of
[3:25:20.640 --> 3:25:24.720]  the year i also want your health questions for dr group and then i'll tell you who i would choose
[3:25:24.720 --> 3:25:30.160]  who alex would choose and dr group can tell you who he would choose as well before we get into more
[3:25:30.160 --> 3:25:36.240]  with dr group i also want to talk about this story petition to ban trump from uk passes 250
[3:25:36.240 --> 3:25:43.120]  000 signatures and could be debated in parliament this is from cnn a petition calling for donald
[3:25:43.120 --> 3:25:47.280]  trump to be banned from entering the uk has attracted more than a quarter of a million
[3:25:47.280 --> 3:25:52.080]  signatures more than enough for a committee to consider sending the motion for parliamentary
[3:25:52.080 --> 3:25:56.640]  debate the petition to block the front-running republican presidential candidate from entering
[3:25:56.640 --> 3:26:02.000]  the country was created on the british government's official petitions website in response to trump's
[3:26:02.000 --> 3:26:08.880]  call monday to ban muslims from entering the country without until obama did something about it
[3:26:09.600 --> 3:26:13.600]  of course it was misquoted over and over again in the media now if this is anything like the
[3:26:13.600 --> 3:26:19.600]  white house dot gov petitions where if you get like 150 000 or whatever it is they have to review it
[3:26:20.240 --> 3:26:25.280]  it's pretty much a joke and in that we've actually i've done some i know alex had a
[3:26:25.280 --> 3:26:29.680]  number of successful petitions that hit the limit like a band pierce morgan or whatever it was
[3:26:29.680 --> 3:26:33.280]  but they usually just respond with oh we looked at it nothing's gonna happen so we'll see what
[3:26:33.280 --> 3:26:38.240]  happens with this but could you imagine if they actually banned donald trump from the uk
[3:26:38.240 --> 3:26:44.000]  and then can you imagine if he actually became president and he was still banned from the uk
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:49.200]  so as the call come all calls come in i want to have dr group just go through a few more
[3:26:49.200 --> 3:26:53.680]  ways that you can really avoid the weight gain the toxic intake during the holidays and just
[3:26:53.680 --> 3:26:57.520]  whenever really in your life some of the most important secrets that we're going to go to your
[3:26:57.520 --> 3:27:02.960]  calls and cover some more news some uplifting news some quantum mechanic news on google's new
[3:27:02.960 --> 3:27:09.040]  super computer that can do math is a lot of interesting stuff but uh dr group well i'm
[3:27:09.040 --> 3:27:13.680]  looking forward to taking some calls but another thing that came up that i wanted to let people
[3:27:13.680 --> 3:27:18.960]  know about is alcohol consumption over the holidays if you are going to be consuming most people
[3:27:18.960 --> 3:27:24.400]  consume two to three times the amount of alcohol there's a lot of hangovers during the holidays
[3:27:24.400 --> 3:27:30.000]  and a lot of people reach for the Tylenol the acetaminophen it's been shown that that can
[3:27:30.000 --> 3:27:35.120]  cause permanent liver damage so i just wanted everybody to be aware that first of all they
[3:27:35.120 --> 3:27:40.800]  should reduce their alcohol content if they can't do that they should drink more water but if you
[3:27:40.800 --> 3:27:48.960]  do have headaches be very careful taking acetaminophen with alcohol i'm i gotta tell you acetaminophen
[3:27:48.960 --> 3:27:54.640]  is is is bad it is i mean i don't even know why children die from that they die from it the liver
[3:27:54.640 --> 3:27:59.520]  failure the liver goes in yeah it's it's so for the record and um not making any claims against
[3:27:59.520 --> 3:28:03.760]  certain brands but the brands that have acetaminophen oftentimes even at small doses there's been
[3:28:03.760 --> 3:28:09.520]  deaths acetaminophen is extremely hepatoxic toxic to the liver and then what what people don't
[3:28:09.520 --> 3:28:13.200]  realize is they're drinking and i've seen people do this i have to stop them from doing it they'll
[3:28:13.200 --> 3:28:17.920]  be out drinking the night before and they'll say oh well just pop this uh you know pill a brand name
[3:28:17.920 --> 3:28:23.760]  pill with acetaminophen in it and i'll be fine no no no if you are taking it with alcohol you're
[3:28:23.760 --> 3:28:27.280]  damaging your liver and then if you wake up and you're still drunk or you have a hangover or whatever
[3:28:27.280 --> 3:28:30.880]  you're damaging it still it cannot be taken with alcohol at all so many people actually die from
[3:28:30.880 --> 3:28:37.520]  that here's the thing if you if you don't change your diet at all and you continue doing every
[3:28:37.520 --> 3:28:44.960]  single thing you normally do during the holiday season then at least take some x2 iodine which
[3:28:44.960 --> 3:28:50.240]  is going to help you detoxify take some deep cleanse take some oxy powder and just supplement i mean
[3:28:50.240 --> 3:28:54.720]  right there alone you're going to be taking care of the majority of the problems and drinking more
[3:28:54.720 --> 3:29:02.800]  water and reducing your stress levels over the holidays that's that's many many solutions that
[3:29:02.800 --> 3:29:08.400]  people can put into place and the other great solution is just eat organic food and don't
[3:29:08.400 --> 3:29:15.520]  buy all the boxed and canned ingredients for christmas look at stuffing for example i mean if you
[3:29:15.520 --> 3:29:21.440]  read the ingredients on a stuffing box from the store it's this long the gravies all contain msg
[3:29:21.440 --> 3:29:27.680]  all the the powdered gravies that you mix have msg in them just go back to the old school way of
[3:29:27.680 --> 3:29:33.280]  doing things and eat healthy and cook your own christmas dinner with organic ingredients and it's
[3:29:33.280 --> 3:29:36.880]  cheaper too people always say well i can't afford organic well if you buy the actual raw materials
[3:29:36.880 --> 3:29:40.800]  it's much easier we'll be back with your calls and more news it's the alex jones show i'm anthony

[3:34:54.960 --> 3:34:59.520]  for a reason because they work now let's go to some calls let's jump right into
[3:35:00.720 --> 3:35:08.160]  david in new Hampshire what's up david hey uh guys i was just uh calling in because i had heard
[3:35:08.160 --> 3:35:13.440]  earlier uh alex talking a lot about what's going on with the politics but now you guys are talking
[3:35:13.440 --> 3:35:17.760]  about the holidays you're talking about the stresses and the food and the sugar and everything
[3:35:17.760 --> 3:35:22.240]  that people eat in the holidays but this point ties in with that and it ties in with the fact that
[3:35:22.240 --> 3:35:30.640]  people have a an electrical bio bio electrical uh body well our bodies are are based off of the
[3:35:30.640 --> 3:35:37.760]  electricity and and the energy that goes through them and people are kept on a level of fear based
[3:35:37.760 --> 3:35:45.920]  and emotional based and sexual based um ideas and the reason why we like to eat so much during
[3:35:45.920 --> 3:35:49.920]  holidays is because it's an emotional thing eating is an emotional thing anybody who's
[3:35:49.920 --> 3:35:56.000]  done a cleanse knows that uh eating becomes a very a very emotional thing and where you don't eat
[3:35:56.000 --> 3:36:02.480]  with everybody else you realize how much you you you become codependent in relationships
[3:36:02.480 --> 3:36:08.320]  and other things so i bring this point out to say that until we as a people as a society can
[3:36:08.320 --> 3:36:14.560]  grab a hold of our emotions understand who we are a sexual being and also as emotional beings
[3:36:14.560 --> 3:36:19.040]  and spiritual beings what will continue the same pattern it doesn't matter if you if you
[3:36:19.040 --> 3:36:24.880]  alarm someone to the dangers of you know fluoride or the dangers of corn syrup it's like until they
[3:36:24.880 --> 3:36:30.240]  understand themselves as a spiritual entity as something that can function 100 completely
[3:36:30.240 --> 3:36:35.440]  healthily uh you know you're you're going to have these these these issues but um yeah that was
[3:36:35.440 --> 3:36:40.240]  beautifully said and i would agree with a lot of that and in fact i agree with all of it and
[3:36:40.240 --> 3:36:44.000]  except for the part that you can't warn people and you can't wake them up because i'm here to tell
[3:36:44.000 --> 3:36:50.400]  you that you really can and there is obviously a really really deep core thing that we also realize
[3:36:50.400 --> 3:36:54.960]  that sure we are we're human beings we have a power we have a you know human spirit whatever
[3:36:54.960 --> 3:36:59.120]  you want to call it we have consciousness whatever you want to believe and obviously a lot of the
[3:36:59.120 --> 3:37:04.800]  things that we do are because we're in a charged emotional fight or flight state or in a fear-based
[3:37:04.800 --> 3:37:09.680]  state from watching the mainstream media i call it feeding your brain cheese whiz right you wouldn't
[3:37:09.680 --> 3:37:14.720]  eat cheese whiz every day so why do we treat our content consumption so much differently than our
[3:37:14.720 --> 3:37:18.960]  food consumption i wouldn't sit here and eat laced potato chips or whatever type of potato chips
[3:37:18.960 --> 3:37:23.760]  doritos whatever for every day for 12 hours just like i wouldn't watch the mainstream media or
[3:37:23.760 --> 3:37:28.240]  american idol every single day for 12 hours i wouldn't personally but some people do and when
[3:37:28.240 --> 3:37:33.520]  they have that content stream coming in their brain feeding their brain junk the cheese whiz of
[3:37:33.520 --> 3:37:38.400]  content they get into a poor state they hear only about the terrorism and the fights and obama
[3:37:38.400 --> 3:37:44.560]  coming on television saying isis is going to get you if you don't turn in your guns we fight back
[3:37:44.560 --> 3:37:49.920]  with the counter information and i try to get a positive solution-based thing and alex does too
[3:37:49.920 --> 3:37:55.680]  constantly all the time and fighting back against all of that and it can get tiresome it can feel
[3:37:55.680 --> 3:37:58.800]  like a lot it can make you want to give up sometimes but the truth is you have to keep
[3:37:58.800 --> 3:38:04.720]  going on and that's what you're saying and i agree with you right but i also say give people
[3:38:04.720 --> 3:38:07.760]  some more chance than that right because we're waking them up about this they might learn about
[3:38:07.760 --> 3:38:12.000]  the fluoride that might learn about any of this stuff and then say wow i really want to learn
[3:38:12.000 --> 3:38:16.800]  more and make a change and how many people have i seen that happen to including myself right because
[3:38:16.800 --> 3:38:22.240]  i was never just a magically awake magically conscious i knew all this stuff it was i know i
[3:38:22.240 --> 3:38:26.960]  was a standard quote unquote normal person that would eat drink my eggnog or whatever you want to
[3:38:26.960 --> 3:38:31.680]  call it you know without knowing what i was doing so i i believe in everyone i believe in their ability
[3:38:31.680 --> 3:38:36.960]  to rise up 100 but what you said was beautiful and i want to get dr groups take on this but i
[3:38:36.960 --> 3:38:40.480]  have one final question who is your time person of the year if you could choose one
[3:38:42.400 --> 3:38:49.520]  david of the year um time person of the year uh it's only two people come up from the head right
[3:38:49.520 --> 3:38:57.360]  now uh donald trump or the poof and it's just because you have two of these people who understand
[3:38:57.360 --> 3:39:02.880]  what's going on in the world to a certain extent and uh the trump i have feared the greater military
[3:39:02.880 --> 3:39:07.920]  expansion and the same thing but at least they understand that well david thank you right on
[3:39:07.920 --> 3:39:12.400]  right on and i i apologize cutting you off but the uh the music of the children in the back
[3:39:12.400 --> 3:39:16.160]  was it was very beautiful but i'm not you know some listeners might not enjoy it as much but
[3:39:16.160 --> 3:39:20.560]  dr group tell me your take on that and by the way those are two great choices i mean i mean you just
[3:39:20.560 --> 3:39:24.720]  you have to look at it no i mean i know david knows what he's what he's talking about and
[3:39:24.720 --> 3:39:30.240]  that is the main goal i mean the main goal is to is to change the world and help as many people
[3:39:30.240 --> 3:39:37.280]  as we can and bring back the consciousness and let people know who they are really inside
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:44.320]  and i can tell you that by cleansing the body looking at what causes fear because again it's
[3:39:44.320 --> 3:39:49.680]  all about what is the root cause of our problem here what causes fear what causes depression
[3:39:49.680 --> 3:39:57.040]  what causes all these things that create the desire for addiction food is the is more addictive
[3:39:57.040 --> 3:40:02.560]  than drugs people don't even realize that alcohol kills more people food kills more people than drugs
[3:40:02.560 --> 3:40:10.000]  do gluten and wheat contain opiates they're addictive that's why people get addicted to
[3:40:10.000 --> 3:40:19.120]  bread and addicted to foods it makes you feel good sugar makes you feel good exactly so but i
[3:40:19.120 --> 3:40:24.960]  can tell you after evaluating hundreds of thousands of people that have gone through cleansing that
[3:40:24.960 --> 3:40:30.800]  the positive thing the positive outlook that people have you changed your life when you were
[3:40:30.800 --> 3:40:36.720]  suffering with disease and you found natural medicine i grew up on tv dinners and you know
[3:40:36.720 --> 3:40:42.800]  coca-cola and the worst food and diets that you could imagine i'd act me all over my face and
[3:40:43.760 --> 3:40:51.280]  i changed my life you changed your life people every single day are changing their life even if
[3:40:51.280 --> 3:40:56.720]  they're doing it one step at a time if there's a if there's a massive staircase that goes all
[3:40:56.720 --> 3:41:02.240]  the way down to cancer and disease and goes all the way up to perfect health you don't have to take
[3:41:02.240 --> 3:41:07.520]  and jump a hundred steps at a time it's about a daily change as a matter of fact that's what i
[3:41:07.520 --> 3:41:13.520]  recommend next time you need to buy salt for your home don't buy table salt buy himalayan
[3:41:13.520 --> 3:41:18.640]  crystal salt next time you need to buy deodorant don't buy aluminum based deodorant buy natural
[3:41:18.640 --> 3:41:25.040]  deodorant yes it's in most of the cases it's not as good you might have to apply it two times a day
[3:41:25.040 --> 3:41:30.480]  but you're making baby steps you're making changes and you're educating yourself and you're doing
[3:41:30.480 --> 3:41:36.000]  what your body wants you to do and believe it or not you will become more conscious that way
[3:41:36.000 --> 3:41:44.640]  when you detoxify the body look at what causes depression and addiction fluoride causes calcification
[3:41:44.640 --> 3:41:51.280]  of your pineal gland it causes depressive like symptoms it causes non aggressiveness you when
[3:41:51.280 --> 3:41:59.600]  you look at bpa fluoride mercury cadmium aluminum lead all the phthalates the bpas all of these
[3:41:59.600 --> 3:42:07.120]  different types of chemicals yes they do affect your brain they make you to the point where you
[3:42:07.120 --> 3:42:12.800]  are unhappy and that's why the psyche psychological industry is so profitable and that's why the
[3:42:12.800 --> 3:42:19.520]  pharmaceutical companies are focusing the majority of their marketing dollars on anxiety depression
[3:42:19.520 --> 3:42:26.160]  and stress and everything else because there's no clinical testing needed to prescribe these
[3:42:26.160 --> 3:42:30.160]  medications even though for years we've been telling you it's all in the gut i mean you've
[3:42:30.160 --> 3:42:34.320]  said it for 20 plus years i'm just a little mimica really but i'm reading the studies and i found
[3:42:34.320 --> 3:42:39.920]  out for myself independently and realized you're saying the same thing but geez the study's proving
[3:42:39.920 --> 3:42:46.320]  that mental illness starts in the gut and a lot of people also say well i'll also prove that you're
[3:42:46.320 --> 3:42:49.200]  your real consciousness your real intellectual expansion whatever you want to call it has a
[3:42:49.200 --> 3:42:54.640]  biological aspect because most people that feel anxiety and depression they don't even realize
[3:42:54.640 --> 3:42:59.440]  that could be a biological factor as opposed you know a physical health gut factor as opposed to a
[3:42:59.440 --> 3:43:04.720]  mental factor and a lot of it is a gut imbalance so it's like an your body can either help you or
[3:43:04.720 --> 3:43:09.200]  can be an anchor pulling you down and when people's bodies aren't in alignment they're totally jacked
[3:43:09.200 --> 3:43:13.760]  up and thanks to these corporations that don't care by the way the true culprits of all this
[3:43:13.760 --> 3:43:18.320]  when they're totally just bloated and feeling like crap how are they supposed to be sitting
[3:43:18.320 --> 3:43:23.360]  there having an intellectual revolution it's just not going to happen the gut is contaminated and
[3:43:23.360 --> 3:43:28.480]  destroyed it's leading to mental illness it's leading to memory loss it's just all these horrible
[3:43:28.480 --> 3:43:32.320]  things so overall i 100 percent agree it starts really with the body and cleansing which is what
[3:43:32.320 --> 3:43:36.720]  we're all talking about let's go to jim he wants to talk about cleansing jim in florida what's on
[3:43:36.720 --> 3:43:42.560]  your mind hey jim can you hear us your phone working
[3:43:45.120 --> 3:43:49.760]  all right jim thank you for your call unfortunately your phone is not working right now let's talk to
[3:43:50.720 --> 3:43:55.200]  stefan i believe in washington wants to talk about bloating and feeling out of it and possibly
[3:43:55.200 --> 3:44:03.600]  cleansing as well what's on your mind yeah hi there yeah so i'm normal weight everywhere except
[3:44:03.600 --> 3:44:12.080]  on my stomach especially in the evening i'm like a pregnant woman walking around so what what do you
[3:44:12.080 --> 3:44:22.160]  have well do you consume alcohol no okay so if you don't drink then normally if you have some bloating
[3:44:22.160 --> 3:44:30.160]  in the afternoon for men if you have that extra weight around your waist most likely your liver
[3:44:30.160 --> 3:44:34.400]  is congested that's there's a there's a few different things so we'll talk about each your
[3:44:34.400 --> 3:44:40.080]  liver is congested and you need to to do a liver cleanse maybe one two or three liver cleanses
[3:44:40.080 --> 3:44:47.040]  because that means your liver is not processing and metabolizing the fats effectively and without
[3:44:47.040 --> 3:44:52.480]  getting into your whole dietary habits and everything else iodine deficiency is another
[3:44:52.480 --> 3:44:59.040]  cause of weight gain around the waist in males it could also be associated with a b12 deficiency
[3:44:59.040 --> 3:45:04.960]  of item and d deficiency but with continued cleansing going back to what anthony said the
[3:45:04.960 --> 3:45:12.480]  gut how important the gut is it's amazing how many symptoms mysteriously disappear not mysteriously
[3:45:12.480 --> 3:45:19.840]  but because the body actually has the necessary tools to heal itself when you fix the gut the
[3:45:19.840 --> 3:45:26.160]  gut is the bio dome it's like the soil of the earth you know when you in soil you have microorganisms
[3:45:26.160 --> 3:45:32.320]  right that cause the plant to grow and thrive in the gut you have microorganisms a lot of them
[3:45:32.320 --> 3:45:37.840]  actually are soil based microorganisms that live in your gut what those organisms do we call them
[3:45:37.840 --> 3:45:43.520]  probiotics and prebiotics are what probiotics eat the prebiotics are different types of foods and
[3:45:44.080 --> 3:45:52.400]  inulin and and oligosaccharides that the probiotics feed on when you have the proper balance of
[3:45:52.400 --> 3:45:59.680]  probiotics in your gut that will reduce some of the gas reduce some of the bloating believe it or
[3:45:59.680 --> 3:46:05.920]  not your neurotransmitters are produced in your gut that keep you happy it's serotonin melatonin
[3:46:05.920 --> 3:46:12.400]  things like that so the first step that I always take with anybody regardless of what condition
[3:46:12.400 --> 3:46:17.760]  they're suffering from is to clean and repair the gut you know clean it out really good with
[3:46:17.760 --> 3:46:24.160]  the oxypowder use a good probiotic formula repair all that of course slowly change their diet at
[3:46:24.160 --> 3:46:31.840]  the same time but thyroid issues really can can cause excessive weight gain in different areas
[3:46:31.840 --> 3:46:38.720]  of the body and men usually around the waist so I would definitely look at possibly supplementing
[3:46:38.720 --> 3:46:43.600]  with an iodine supplement such as x2 and of course none of this is medical advice yeah I'll
[3:46:43.600 --> 3:46:48.080]  also say that you should be thankful you're getting these signs and symptoms because I used to have
[3:46:48.080 --> 3:46:52.480]  that a long time ago and then I started really feeling more depressed and feeling more anxiety
[3:46:52.480 --> 3:46:56.800]  and feeling like crap and the bloating wasn't there as much this is the beginning in my view
[3:46:56.800 --> 3:47:01.280]  again not medical advice of something that you can start potentially fixing thank you so much for
[3:47:01.280 --> 3:47:06.000]  your call we're going to go to Steven in Florida he wants to talk about digestion and he wants to
[3:47:06.000 --> 3:47:11.200]  talk about person of the year and I want to add finish up this call and get into who we choose
[3:47:11.200 --> 3:47:16.320]  as person of the year and talk about some of that as well so Steven first of all who is your person
[3:47:16.320 --> 3:47:25.040]  of the year uh yeah good afternoon uh well I've got a east versus west I've really got two uh if it
[3:47:25.040 --> 3:47:30.880]  was a matter of east I would have to nominate Vladimir Putin because this man like Alex Jones
[3:47:30.880 --> 3:47:36.400]  says has really taken the moral high ground he stepped up he sent multiple messages to the
[3:47:36.400 --> 3:47:41.920]  globalist that he's not going to let them run him with his attacks on ISIS uh his you know
[3:47:41.920 --> 3:47:46.160]  what I have considered not to sword rattling he'll make good what he's saying with his threats
[3:47:46.720 --> 3:47:52.560]  uh and rightly so but also this latest news about what he said sending a message to the uh you know
[3:47:52.560 --> 3:48:00.000]  the uh people with the biotech so-called industry like Monsanto about organics this is a really
[3:48:00.000 --> 3:48:06.080]  bombshell information and I hope that he able is able to do that on the western side I would have
[3:48:06.080 --> 3:48:12.880]  to nominate Alex Jones because I think of anybody in America he has really stepped up and I know he
[3:48:12.880 --> 3:48:18.880]  says he's not a hero but he is a modern day Paul Revere and among the founding fathers of that
[3:48:18.880 --> 3:48:23.920]  ill because that's who I would that's the two that I would nominate each boy I think those are
[3:48:23.920 --> 3:48:29.200]  two great choices and you know you talk about Putin he wants to become an exporter of non-gmo
[3:48:29.200 --> 3:48:35.280]  food he talks about the western food supply dying he constantly just criticizes all the
[3:48:35.280 --> 3:48:39.120]  really really good points that he uh brings up in the United States obviously has some issues as
[3:48:39.120 --> 3:48:43.920]  well you talk about Alex he's in here every day three hours on the radio show and what you don't
[3:48:43.920 --> 3:48:50.880]  see is the five plus hours he works every single day off the air and he's 100 dedicated 100 real
[3:48:50.880 --> 3:48:55.600]  and I totally stand behind that choice as well so actually if you want to ask a question on the
[3:48:55.600 --> 3:49:01.040]  just have checked real quick Steven go ahead and burst it out yeah I've got a friend that had recently
[3:49:01.040 --> 3:49:05.520]  she's been diagnosed with I think it's celiac disease and she had to go to the hospital after
[3:49:05.520 --> 3:49:10.640]  an attack in her bowel she had seven feet of her intestines removed lost a lot of weight
[3:49:10.640 --> 3:49:16.560]  so recovering at home but what I wanted to find out is this with the cleansing systems that doctor
[3:49:16.560 --> 3:49:22.720]  group that you've developed like the oxy powder and the liver cleanse etc would those would you
[3:49:22.720 --> 3:49:26.960]  recommend those to someone like that because their doctors are having around a special basically
[3:49:26.960 --> 3:49:33.040]  liquefied diet so she can't have anything solid but do you think that would help her or be you
[3:49:33.040 --> 3:49:38.160]  know harmful to her in her situation let me also just jump in and say once again this is not medical
[3:49:38.160 --> 3:49:41.920]  advice so we're not giving medical advice to your friend she should obviously speak to a qualified
[3:49:41.920 --> 3:49:45.520]  healthcare professional that is able to see her and physically see her I mean doctor groups just
[3:49:45.520 --> 3:49:50.640]  sitting here you know listen to a vague example of the story you know which is see a doctor I just
[3:49:50.640 --> 3:49:56.000]  I can't stand the regulations because it's just you know you you can't tell somebody something
[3:49:56.000 --> 3:50:00.960]  that you know works a hundred percent of the time so it's just crazy the regulations they're
[3:50:00.960 --> 3:50:05.520]  coming down with and it's all done by design they're really trying to push out the natural medicine

[3:54:09.200 --> 3:54:14.080]  welcome back to the fourth hour of the alex joneshell manthony guttiardy joined with dr edward
[3:54:14.080 --> 3:54:18.720]  group and we're talking about who we would choose for time person of the year and i'm going to
[3:54:18.720 --> 3:54:23.920]  explain alex's choice as well and dr group here is going to tell you so time magazine in case you
[3:54:23.920 --> 3:54:29.840]  didn't hear today named german chancellor angela merkel as the person of the year previous ones
[3:54:29.840 --> 3:54:36.480]  include the ebola fighters pope francis president obama the protester for arab spring led himself
[3:54:36.480 --> 3:54:41.680]  on fire and mark zuckerberg some interesting choices some i can understand some are quite
[3:54:41.680 --> 3:54:48.080]  interesting like pope francis and mark zuckerberg and obviously obama but we took a number of calls
[3:54:48.080 --> 3:54:53.360]  and some of the callers said they chose putin trump alex and i think that was it
[3:54:53.360 --> 3:54:57.840]  dr group who is your choice for time person of the year if you could magically choose it well
[3:54:57.840 --> 3:55:02.800]  first of all i don't really agree that much with time person of the year but uh i would have to
[3:55:02.800 --> 3:55:08.320]  since it's not technically a person of the year i would have to give that award to all of the
[3:55:09.440 --> 3:55:15.520]  individual activists that have posted information on youtube that have gone out to the march against
[3:55:15.520 --> 3:55:24.320]  monsanto the rallies all the people out there that are educating everybody else to against the tyranny
[3:55:24.320 --> 3:55:29.680]  that's out there today i mean it's stuff that we work for every single day and it's you know
[3:55:29.680 --> 3:55:33.360]  somebody asked me you know why don't you get in politics and why don't you be a senator and i said
[3:55:33.360 --> 3:55:39.760]  do you know how change happens okay we wouldn't have the non-gmo verified seal if it wasn't for
[3:55:39.760 --> 3:55:46.240]  the public speaking out in the public refusing to buy things it's the activism and it's the people
[3:55:46.240 --> 3:55:52.560]  that create more change look organic foods look at all the different changes getting fluoride out
[3:55:52.560 --> 3:55:57.040]  of the water all the activism there all the education all the videos that are going up
[3:55:57.040 --> 3:56:00.880]  everywhere all the newsletters that are going out educating people all the people that are
[3:56:00.880 --> 3:56:07.040]  dedicating their life every single day working eight hours 12 hours a day to try to change the
[3:56:07.040 --> 3:56:12.400]  world make the world a better place to be cleaning up the air quality cleaning up the water quality
[3:56:12.400 --> 3:56:17.680]  educating people and how they can become healthy and change their lives grassroots efforts that's
[3:56:17.680 --> 3:56:21.920]  how change happens it's not going to change in government that's right that's right that's an
[3:56:21.920 --> 3:56:27.120]  amazing choice and so alex's choice we just briefly question you know asked him the question before
[3:56:27.120 --> 3:56:30.480]  we walked in so he could probably give a better explanation perhaps on the show but he chose
[3:56:30.480 --> 3:56:35.280]  donald trump and i totally get it why not only is trump standing against political correctness
[3:56:35.280 --> 3:56:41.840]  but the mainstream media hates him and he's standing up against them really as a third party
[3:56:41.840 --> 3:56:46.720]  against the g.o.p establishment against all establishments he is an anti-establishment
[3:56:46.720 --> 3:56:52.560]  self-made man that can pretty much say whatever he stands for and not have to care and that is
[3:56:52.560 --> 3:56:57.200]  really admirable in many ways even if you don't agree with his politics imagine that someone that
[3:56:57.200 --> 3:57:02.000]  can sit there and he tweets some some hardcore stuff you know definitely calling people dummies
[3:57:02.000 --> 3:57:06.480]  is not along the line of the mainstream media establishment that lock that locks everyone
[3:57:06.480 --> 3:57:10.480]  into this political correctness for me you know i think that's a great choice and i think yours
[3:57:10.480 --> 3:57:16.400]  is an amazing choice as well i would have to say that matt drudge 100% deserves to be time person
[3:57:16.400 --> 3:57:22.560]  of the year if not this year then you know next year because you think about it all these people
[3:57:22.560 --> 3:57:27.200]  are doing amazing things yes trump you know does some some pretty amazing things standing up for the
[3:57:27.200 --> 3:57:31.120]  the right ways even if you don't believe in many of his politics the activists all this stuff
[3:57:31.120 --> 3:57:36.240]  but where does it all go to it goes to the bullhorn of reality where do you go for news where do you
[3:57:36.240 --> 3:57:41.040]  go to see what you know trump said or what putin did or wherever you go you go to drudge report
[3:57:41.040 --> 3:57:45.280]  every single day and you sit there and you let it refresh for eight hours while you're at the
[3:57:45.280 --> 3:57:49.520]  workplace or wherever you are and it's kind of a behind the scene thing behind the scenes thing
[3:57:49.520 --> 3:57:54.000]  right there's no photos of matt drudge there's no videos he's behind the scenes guy but he's giving
[3:57:54.000 --> 3:57:59.680]  it all to you and feeding it in a way that makes sense and it's a succinct bullhorn of reality so
[3:57:59.680 --> 3:58:05.360]  i would choose 100 matt drudge and i salute him for all he has done this is the alex joneshow alex
[3:58:05.360 --> 3:58:10.320]  will be back live from 11th to tomorrow i'm anthony goodsharty dr group thanks so much for
[3:58:10.320 --> 3:58:30.960]  joining us and all have an amazing day we'll see you again tomorrow
