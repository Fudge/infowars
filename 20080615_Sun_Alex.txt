[00:00.000 --> 00:05.120]  The mayor of Waterloo, Iowa is calling for a voluntary evacuation of an area that includes
[00:05.120 --> 00:10.560]  part of the city's downtown. The flood waters there aren't subsiding as quickly as expected.
[00:10.560 --> 00:15.520]  In Illinois, communities along the Mississippi are sandbagging as they brace for expected flooding.
[00:16.080 --> 00:21.760]  United Way of Central Iowa President Susan Coalfield says the area has seen a rush of volunteers
[00:21.760 --> 00:27.360]  following days of flooding. We have had a young man from South Dakota and we've had a number,
[00:27.360 --> 00:31.040]  just a cross-section of the community, people who couldn't even drive but walked to the Volunteer
[00:31.040 --> 00:36.320]  Reception Center to volunteer. And favorable weather has helped crews in Northern California
[00:36.320 --> 00:43.360]  fight a wildfire that's destroyed dozens of homes. The fire is blazed through 36 square miles near
[00:43.360 --> 00:49.040]  the town of Paradise, north of Sacramento. Some homeowners have been allowed back in to inspect
[00:49.040 --> 00:57.200]  the damage. This is IRN-USA Radio News. Suriasis, the itching, flaking and irritation is painful,
[00:57.200 --> 01:01.920]  but the emotional suffering can be even more devastating. My body was so sore, my mind was so
[01:01.920 --> 01:05.920]  worn out, I could not sleep at night. I felt self-conscious, nobody knows what that plighty
[01:05.920 --> 01:09.520]  is. And people say, ew, it just made me feel like you're dirty. I don't want people knowing I have
[01:09.520 --> 01:13.920]  this embarrassing. Of course I felt self-conscious, not very attractive to look at. The solution is

[01:57.520 --> 02:03.040]  final jaunt through Europe. He took a bike ride and went to church in Paris this morning and
[02:03.040 --> 02:08.080]  meets this afternoon with the Queen of England at Windsor Castle. Tonight the Bushes have dinner
[02:08.080 --> 02:14.000]  with Prime Minister Gordon Brown and he used his weekly radio address yesterday to discuss his talks
[02:14.000 --> 02:18.960]  with leaders there. In my meetings I've discussed our shared efforts to advance peace and prosperity
[02:18.960 --> 02:24.000]  around the world. America has strong partners and leaders like Italy, Sylvio, Berlusconi,
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.520]  Germany's Angela Merkel, France's Nicholas Sarkozy and Britain's Gordon Brown. And Americans living
[02:29.520 --> 02:35.760]  near the Mexican border are taking advantage of Mexico's fuel subsidies. A gallon of regular
[02:35.760 --> 02:43.200]  unleaded gasoline in San Diego retails for an average price of 461. A few miles south in Tijuana
[02:43.200 --> 02:49.760]  it's more than two dollars cheaper. Pay with pesos and it's even less. For more news and analysis

[03:21.600 --> 03:27.840]  it's brighter. Both presumptive presidential nominees have taken time off from the campaign
[03:27.840 --> 03:33.440]  trail to remember and honor newsman Tim Resert. Democrat Barack Obama said the host of Meet the
[03:33.440 --> 03:42.160]  Press who died Friday in Washington DC will be missed. I hope that even though Tim is irreplaceable
[03:42.160 --> 03:48.960]  that the standard that he set in his professional life and his family life are standards that we
[03:48.960 --> 03:55.920]  all carry with us in our own lives. Republican John McCain spoke of Resert's character. Tim Resert
[03:56.800 --> 04:02.160]  was at the top of his profession. He was a man of honesty and integrity. He was hard but he was
[04:02.160 --> 04:08.000]  always there. Resert died at the age of 58 of an apparent heart attack. He was one of the best
[04:08.000 --> 04:13.440]  known political reporters on television. He was also senior vice president and Washington bureau
[04:13.440 --> 04:19.200]  chief of NBC News. And with a number of storms popping up along the east coast Saturday evening,
[04:19.200 --> 04:24.320]  hundreds of travelers faced long flight delays. At Dulles International Airport,
[04:24.320 --> 04:29.600]  up to two and a half hour delays reported at Reagan National 90 minutes. Last night storms
[04:29.600 --> 04:38.880]  forced Giulio Arce to stay at National Airport overnight. The situation was slightly better
[04:38.880 --> 04:45.440]  at BWI where passengers faced delays of up to 45 minutes. Passengers flying out today should fare
[04:45.440 --> 04:52.000]  better with sunny skies in the forecast. I'm Jody Jordan and that's news from the information radio
[04:52.000 --> 04:58.800]  network. More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you
[04:58.800 --> 05:03.200]  have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[05:03.200 --> 05:07.680]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the
[05:07.680 --> 05:13.520]  skin. The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce
[05:13.520 --> 05:19.840]  chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[05:19.840 --> 05:25.680]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first.
[05:25.680 --> 05:30.000]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[05:30.000 --> 05:34.960]  iron, heavy metals and bacteria. What about you? Order your KDF shower filter normally

[07:51.280 --> 07:55.000]  would fill you in on some of the things that went on at Bilderberg but again you

[08:00.360 --> 08:04.960]  is a plan to kill the internet as you know it I've been telling people about
[08:04.960 --> 08:10.960]  this for a long long time and now the mainstream media is preparing the slaves
[08:10.960 --> 08:18.520]  the cattle the mindless gibbering giggling laughing slave public that this
[08:18.520 --> 08:25.920]  is going to be happening so we'll be going over that for you today as well
[08:25.920 --> 08:39.320]  and we'll go through their own admissions of that also also we have
[08:39.320 --> 08:44.800]  attacks on free speech going on all over the United States and the world now

[09:06.800 --> 09:12.920]  vote in the 50 plus years of the European Union all three times that they've
[09:12.920 --> 09:17.520]  been allowed to vote in the Netherlands and then in France in 2005 and now
[09:17.520 --> 09:25.400]  Friday in Ireland it has gone down in defeat but I have all the different EU
[09:25.400 --> 09:29.120]  heads here saying they don't care the people don't want it or not they will
[09:29.120 --> 09:36.240]  go under this control grid they will go under the control of this system and
[09:36.240 --> 09:40.440]  they will have no free speech or no rights under the system it states it all
[09:40.440 --> 09:45.120]  right there it is a dictatorship their countries respectively will have no
[09:45.120 --> 09:49.600]  authority as well and it's just all right there in the Lisbon Treaty and
[09:49.600 --> 09:54.040]  Baroso the head of the EU says it doesn't matter if they voted it down they
[09:54.040 --> 09:58.120]  will continue to forcibly integrate Ireland into the European Union
[09:58.120 --> 10:03.080]  criminally with their criminal government they're completely lawless
[10:03.080 --> 10:11.480]  government and that's really what all of this is about that's what all of this
[10:11.480 --> 10:15.760]  is about here ladies and gentlemen is private interests that are basically
[10:15.760 --> 10:20.600]  pirates that control your governments and your top 100 corporations and they
[10:20.600 --> 10:25.440]  are waging systematic scientific monopoly warfare to consolidate wealth
[10:25.440 --> 10:29.400]  dumb down populations destroy middle classes that are not dependent on them
[10:29.400 --> 10:34.200]  and they are doing one heck of a job I don't like it that all of this is
[10:34.200 --> 10:37.400]  happening I'm not pleased that our government's run by terrorists I'm not
[10:37.400 --> 10:42.320]  pleased that they are raping us devaluing the dollar and that the public is
[10:42.320 --> 10:49.680]  totally unaware of why gas prices are so high I hear them like blind fools by
[10:49.680 --> 10:53.640]  blind I mean blind to the situation stumbling around all over talk radio
[10:53.640 --> 10:59.800]  grasping at straws all the wrong reasons of why people are paying so much for
[10:59.800 --> 11:06.360]  oil and it is because the dollar has been devalued depending on how you look at
[11:06.360 --> 11:13.640]  it 56 percent to 70 percent and it's good continuing to be devalued and you
[11:13.640 --> 11:17.800]  will never hear not a liberal show not a conservative show they're all in the
[11:17.800 --> 11:22.520]  false paradigm all controlled you will never hear them talk about it you will
[11:22.520 --> 11:26.000]  never hear it even when the dollar is forgotten like the peso of the ruble
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.360]  they will still be stumbling around self-assured having no idea what's
[11:30.360 --> 11:34.720]  happening the financial shows won't tell you the little fake conservative shows
[11:34.720 --> 11:38.080]  that all talk about how much they love American flags and oh you just need to

[12:46.800 --> 12:52.520]  trailer for truth rising that comes out July 4th and the film is about something
[12:52.520 --> 12:56.280]  that isn't a conspiracy theory something that isn't debated that the government

[13:01.280 --> 13:05.440]  thousands more dead and dying 56,000 that they knew they covered it up and

[13:44.280 --> 13:49.000]  US having no liberty having open borders having our name our dollar destroyed
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.200]  now not all the troops the majority of them are awake and know what's going on
[13:52.200 --> 13:55.400]  evidence by Ron Paul getting more contributions than any other candidate
[13:55.400 --> 14:00.640]  and all Republicans can bind but there are certain cadres who are gonna rule
[14:00.640 --> 14:05.200]  this new third world country and and by the way a lot of them you link through
[14:05.200 --> 14:08.920]  when they're on your site threatening you on your message board on prison
[14:08.920 --> 14:13.640]  planner posting the articles on info wars or on my myspace and they'll say I've
[14:13.640 --> 14:16.680]  been in them army for five years I've been the Marine Corps for four years and
[14:16.680 --> 14:21.640]  I'm going to school right now in Texas or Indiana to be a peace officer and I'm
[14:21.640 --> 14:25.200]  gonna kill you and so that's who we're gonna have is is guys who've been
[14:25.200 --> 14:28.320]  murdering and killing in Iraq and Afghanistan who believe there's no
[14:28.320 --> 14:33.080]  First Amendment who believe I should be killed because you can go up there look
[14:33.080 --> 14:36.160]  at the trailer and go find the comments and link over I mean these are Marines
[14:36.160 --> 14:39.440]  with weapons and I need to die for saying the government and showing the
[14:39.440 --> 14:43.520]  documents and the EPA clips and the Congress admitting that they covered up
[14:43.520 --> 14:49.280]  the dust I mean that's I can't even say the government lies about anything even
[14:49.280 --> 14:53.560]  when they do I mean that's that's treason now and when we come back from
[14:53.560 --> 14:59.480]  break that leads me to the next subject Michael Reagan adopted son of Ronald
[14:59.480 --> 15:07.360]  Reagan came out and said that 9-11 truthers need to be killed he said that
[15:07.360 --> 15:13.080]  we all need to be killed and he named Mark dice and said go find him and
[15:13.080 --> 15:17.040]  murder him and Mike Reagan's with calling Mark dice begging him to drop
[15:17.040 --> 15:22.560]  things they know that this he solicited capital murder on the air I mean he
[15:22.560 --> 15:25.400]  wasn't joking he said I want you to go find him I want you to kill him I'm gonna
[15:25.400 --> 15:30.040]  pay for it and he didn't say it was a joke and so the question is will they
[15:30.040 --> 15:35.040]  selectively enforce the law and let him contract capital murder on air and we'll
[15:35.040 --> 15:38.400]  talk about the attack on free speech in this country see they're saying we need
[15:38.400 --> 15:43.560]  to die for our free speech we'll be right back stay with us

[20:19.840 --> 20:26.160]  world elite met and plan our future they're gonna be attacking the internet
[20:26.160 --> 20:34.080]  as well trying to shut it down all stated by the industry analysts and
[20:34.080 --> 20:43.240]  specialists they're introducing it slowly to the slaves that's what they see
[20:43.240 --> 20:47.040]  it says it's what they say we are in their own writings and they say that we
[20:47.040 --> 20:50.720]  deserve to be slaves because the general public doesn't care and isn't tuned in
[20:50.720 --> 20:55.240]  to the reality but the evidence shows that's not the case where three separate
[20:55.240 --> 20:58.880]  times in France the Netherlands and now in Ireland people said no we want to
[20:58.880 --> 21:02.440]  don't want to be under your European Union governmental control we don't
[21:02.440 --> 21:06.960]  want to contractually vote into your system here in the US though they're
[21:06.960 --> 21:10.480]  integrating it by stealth we sued judicial watch didn't got the documents
[21:10.480 --> 21:15.680]  and we are already in North American Union Bush signed it March 24 2005
[21:15.680 --> 21:19.800]  there's been congressional hearings on the subject but the slave public here
[21:19.800 --> 21:25.040]  has been taught how to deny things and so they even write the local paper here
[21:25.040 --> 21:29.800]  in Austin the Chronicle that the Sentra isn't Spanish owned now when they seize
[21:29.800 --> 21:36.040]  roads and take them over and Indiana and in places like Massachusetts it's
[21:36.040 --> 21:40.120]  admitted in the news but not here you just tell people in Austin something
[21:40.120 --> 21:43.600]  isn't far and owned and they'll say yes sir because they want to be delusional I
[21:43.600 --> 21:48.520]  guess well actually the people are catching on the lies now okay there is a
[21:48.520 --> 21:54.680]  lot to cover here let's go ahead and do this this is the son of Ronald Reagan is
[21:54.680 --> 22:00.600]  stepson and I grew up listening to Michael Reagan and liking him by the
[22:00.600 --> 22:04.840]  time I was in college I could tune into him out of San Antonio and you know I'm
[22:04.840 --> 22:10.200]  a pro-second amendment guy I'm a what you'd call a mainline Republican at least
[22:10.200 --> 22:14.200]  in the past and I found out Republicans have given us triple the size of
[22:14.200 --> 22:17.440]  government we had eight years ago I know there's no difference I know the
[22:17.440 --> 22:21.320]  vacation together I know they intermarry that the parties are owned by the
[22:21.320 --> 22:25.760]  fortune 100 and the big think tanks write books about this girl quickly had
[22:25.760 --> 22:28.680]  a Georgetown political science right you know wrote a book about it how it's all
[22:28.680 --> 22:32.200]  a big joke it's kind of like Mary Madeline and James Carville are married
[22:32.200 --> 22:38.800]  or you got two you know top brothers two Benson brothers and ones a Republican
[22:38.800 --> 22:48.000]  ones a Democrat it's all a big joke all a big joke and they get you wedded to one
[22:48.000 --> 22:51.800]  brand name and then it doesn't matter what that brand name does as long as
[22:51.800 --> 22:56.080]  that as long as there's a fake WWF argument going on between the two
[22:56.080 --> 23:01.520]  political parties people will still kind of take the false choice it's a trick of
[23:01.520 --> 23:05.520]  giving you two false choices and I know you the listeners know that we have new
[23:05.520 --> 23:08.240]  listeners every millisecond I want to point that out so this isn't some
[23:08.240 --> 23:14.960]  democratic attack on Michael Reagan the 9-11 truth movement is bipartisan it
[23:14.960 --> 23:22.160]  transcends parties it transcends the false left-right spectrum you have people
[23:22.160 --> 23:25.520]  outside our borders German defense ministers number three and Blair's
[23:25.520 --> 23:29.840]  government in England high-level members of Japanese Parliament architects
[23:29.840 --> 23:35.120]  engineers former Italian president former Italian intelligence ed Jesse you
[23:35.120 --> 23:40.320]  know Ventura the governor you've got Hollywood people best actress this year
[23:40.320 --> 23:45.960]  one of the top bands in the world their lead guy just came out on irish radio
[23:45.960 --> 23:50.600]  and said it was all an inside job and point is it's it's all right to say
[23:50.600 --> 23:55.720]  that it's all right to cover that even if you don't agree with that we have a
[23:55.720 --> 23:59.640]  first amendment right and the first amendment only points out are in a
[23:59.640 --> 24:06.840]  able God-given innate rights that were already there so we're never gonna shut
[24:06.840 --> 24:12.520]  up no matter how bad the threats get and it isn't our opinion that it's been
[24:12.520 --> 24:17.080]  declassified that Israel attacked the USS Liberty along with White House
[24:17.080 --> 24:20.760]  knowledge to try to sink the ship to blame it on Egypt that is now totally
[24:20.760 --> 24:25.400]  declassified mainstream news associated pressure cargo tribune it's done all you
[24:25.400 --> 24:28.240]  that debated us all you that lied all those years and said the admirals were
[24:28.240 --> 24:32.040]  lying and that the chairman of joint Jesus staff was lying and the judge
[24:32.040 --> 24:37.120]  advocate general was lying and then all these people the captain of the ship was
[24:37.120 --> 24:40.840]  lying and doesn't matter now it's declassified Israel's released at the
[24:40.840 --> 24:44.720]  US NSA's released it all staged our government with Israel trying to sink
[24:44.720 --> 24:48.160]  the ship to blame it on Egypt and start World War three it's done Chicago
[24:48.160 --> 24:51.960]  Tribune it's over I told you for all these years Gulf of Tonkin was staged
[24:51.960 --> 24:58.600]  because we had all of these officers that came back from the destroyers saying
[24:58.600 --> 25:01.920]  we weren't attacked it was all staged now they released the presidential tape
[25:01.920 --> 25:06.160]  done totally staged 58,000 Americans died because of that lot of a million
[25:06.160 --> 25:10.840]  Vietnamese but then there's some other cases that aren't as well known like
[25:10.840 --> 25:18.400]  Operation Ajax operation Condor the Gladio projects all declassified all at
[25:18.400 --> 25:23.320]  CIA.gov they just admit yes we blow up school buses we shoot children we attack
[25:23.320 --> 25:28.160]  police stations we blame it on foreign enemies all over the world hundreds and
[25:28.160 --> 25:31.640]  hundreds and hundreds of times and so then we get an operation Northwoods
[25:31.640 --> 25:35.280]  declassified a green-lighted program that went all the way to the president who
[25:35.280 --> 25:39.080]  said no a previous president and it said well hijacked jets by remote control
[25:39.080 --> 25:43.880]  will fly him into buildings will bomb DC will commit sniper attacks here's how
[25:43.880 --> 25:48.840]  we'll frame patsy's we'll dress up our army troops like foreign troops have them
[25:48.840 --> 25:52.600]  attack foreign military bases like the Germans did to start World War one with
[25:52.600 --> 25:58.640]  Poland and you're like whoa and I mean this is this is ABC News Baltimore Sun
[25:58.640 --> 26:01.960]  or you go to the National Security Archives National Archives or you can
[26:01.960 --> 26:07.440]  go to the Library of Congress and I've been there and gotten them and then we
[26:07.440 --> 26:12.960]  bring that up and people say you're a liar you need to die so here is Mike
[26:12.960 --> 26:19.360]  Reagan Mark dies good friend of mine just put out the resistance manifesto good
[26:19.360 --> 26:22.880]  conservative guy tired of the fake Republicans tired of Clinton staging

[26:33.680 --> 26:37.920]  provocateur deal there we're tired of this I mean this is a fact this goes on
[26:37.920 --> 26:42.920]  and it you denying it out there doesn't make it go away I mean we're all in
[26:42.920 --> 26:47.520]  danger here we got some hardcore crooks running things it's criminal elements
[26:47.520 --> 26:50.720]  the government but Reagan comes in and says this needs to happen to mark dies
[26:50.720 --> 26:56.360]  because mark dies is telling people on Fox News he was a guest to mail my film

[33:56.880 --> 34:01.440]  road that is admitted to be real hundreds of these videos on YouTube and
[34:01.440 --> 34:05.280]  Google and then they denied the puppy being thrown off as a puppy now the
[34:05.280 --> 34:08.720]  Marines have kicked the guy the Marines they admit it's true I have hundreds of
[34:08.720 --> 34:12.640]  videos of them shooting dogs and cats for fun and torturing them but also
[34:12.640 --> 34:16.680]  throwing hang grenades out of the sheep herder and killing him and laughing the
[34:16.680 --> 34:20.040]  point is they're coming back here to be cops and they're on my message boards
[34:20.040 --> 34:24.480]  saying hey I'm in the military and I'm gonna kill you Alex and they were
[34:24.480 --> 34:28.160]  already doing this before Michael Reagan went on to four million listeners a day
[34:28.160 --> 34:33.520]  he's rated number nine talk show in the country and said go out and kill Mark
[34:33.520 --> 34:37.360]  Dice and kill the rest of these people play the rest of it they ought to take
[34:37.360 --> 34:41.120]  these excuse me folks I'm going to say this we ought to find the people who are
[34:41.120 --> 34:47.680]  doing this take them out and shoot them really just find the people are you're
[34:47.680 --> 34:50.920]  sending those letters to our troops to demoralize our troops and do what they're
[34:50.920 --> 34:56.520]  doing you take them out they are traitors this country and shoot them you
[34:56.520 --> 35:01.640]  have a problem with that deal with it but anybody who would do that doesn't
[35:01.640 --> 35:06.720]  deserve to live you shoot them you call them traitors that's what they are and
[35:06.720 --> 35:15.120]  you shoot them dead I'll pay for the bullet Mark dice the founder of the
[35:15.120 --> 35:20.240]  resistance which he calls a media watchdog group says that the US
[35:20.240 --> 35:23.400]  government was responsible with the September 11 terrorist attacks and that
[35:23.400 --> 35:28.880]  the armed forces should know it people want the facts the Marines are hungry
[35:28.880 --> 35:34.040]  for the truth what got them there in Iraq why are they risking their lives and
[35:34.040 --> 35:40.400]  we're going to help them understand that so he's going to send letters and the
[35:40.400 --> 35:43.960]  classified government documents that he says can prove the government's
[35:43.960 --> 35:48.360]  responsibility for the terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people and
[35:48.360 --> 35:52.160]  he's urging others to do the same
[35:54.520 --> 36:01.240]  now captain Pete Hexeth executive director of vets for freedom you ought to
[36:01.240 --> 36:06.800]  get him on to Brett I'm on it says you know something he's gonna end up in the
[36:06.800 --> 36:13.360]  trash or they're gonna end up in the toilet or they're going to end up on the
[36:13.360 --> 36:18.680]  firing range how about you take Mark dice out and put him in the middle of the
[36:18.680 --> 36:24.360]  firing range time to a Bose post don't blindfold him let it rip and have some
[36:24.360 --> 36:29.200]  fun with Mark dice these people are just folks I'm telling you outrage alright
[36:29.200 --> 36:31.920]  now we know where they're on yeah now we know where the wrong Paul supporters
[36:31.920 --> 36:34.960]  aren't they going to attacking Ron Paul who doesn't even say 9-11's an inside
[36:34.960 --> 36:39.640]  job just absolutely vicious to any real conservatives that are actually for
[36:39.640 --> 36:43.480]  controlling the borders for the Second Amendment see the rhinos Republican in
[36:43.480 --> 36:47.720]  name only hate true conservatives it's their job and we've got the Republican
[36:47.720 --> 36:50.960]  strategy memos to neutralize real conservatives and they've done it the
[36:50.960 --> 36:54.240]  country's gone you've done a great job Democrats are not gonna take over total
[36:54.240 --> 36:59.000]  socialism it's it's it's incredible but let me before we go to Mark dice talk
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.760]  about who the real traders are here it's the people that raped children and
[37:03.760 --> 37:07.600]  Abu Ghraib and wrote White House memos saying they could torture two-year-olds
[37:07.600 --> 37:13.040]  with pliers sexually yes that's public don't deny it for those you that support
[37:13.040 --> 37:18.560]  the neocons and all this evil and the lies that's what's destroyed our uniform
[37:18.560 --> 37:22.760]  that's what's destroyed our name that's what's destroyed our honor that's what's
[37:22.760 --> 37:27.080]  made this country look bad it's the neocons that have done this it's the
[37:27.080 --> 37:30.200]  criminals in our government that have stolen four trillion out of the pension
[37:30.200 --> 37:34.320]  funds in the Pentagon it's all gone all the money's gone so she had a press and
[37:34.320 --> 37:38.960]  three trillion on the war that's seven trillion they don't care about the flag
[37:38.960 --> 37:43.400]  they don't care about the country they care about giving you a song and dance
[37:43.400 --> 37:48.600]  about being patriotic so you'll sign on to treason so you'll sign on to
[37:48.600 --> 37:52.480]  corruption so you'll sign on to becoming the land of the slaves home of the
[37:52.480 --> 37:57.080]  cowards not the land of the free home of the brave so the real patriots are
[37:57.080 --> 38:03.120]  mark dice and people like that now let's go ahead and bring mark dice up mark I
[38:03.120 --> 38:06.000]  wanted to introduce that I mean these guys have got a lot of nerve they've
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.960]  destroyed this country there's probably no coming back from it the dollars
[38:10.960 --> 38:15.080]  imploding everything's falling apart the family's falling apart both parties are
[38:15.080 --> 38:19.040]  owned by the same interest and then this guy's up there contracting saying I'll
[38:19.040 --> 38:23.040]  pay for the bullet saying kill mark dice and kill the rest of these 9-11 truth
[38:23.040 --> 38:28.040]  people and now he's felt the power of the true Americans and he's scared isn't
[38:28.040 --> 38:33.320]  he's scared he called me personally with a quiver in his voice and apologized
[38:33.320 --> 38:38.120]  offer to have me on his show and despite his apology he's open to Pandora's box
[38:38.120 --> 38:43.000]  that the ramifications of which are are unknown at this time he's opened the
[38:43.000 --> 38:48.360]  door and encouraged stalking vandalism and bodily harm to myself and to
[38:48.360 --> 38:52.680]  others this has reached an outrageous to a point here this is an
[38:52.680 --> 38:57.720]  unprecedented level of hatred and of rhetoric and and probably illegal hate
[38:57.720 --> 39:02.320]  speech aimed towards me to others five times during that statement there's no
[39:02.320 --> 39:07.120]  probably about it mark it's guaranteed a vicious terroristic threat first degree
[39:07.120 --> 39:10.800]  I looked at federal and state law we posted those in info wars dot com and
[39:10.800 --> 39:16.920]  secondarily he is inciting to do bodily harm and naming you by name that's
[39:16.920 --> 39:22.400]  another felony he then openly calls for and offers to give monetary payment for
[39:22.400 --> 39:27.600]  a murder that is contracting for first degree premeditated murder that is
[39:27.600 --> 39:31.160]  punishable by life in prison equally disturbing is the fact that I sent out
[39:31.160 --> 39:35.640]  a press release to over 700 individuals in the news agencies I'm talking every
[39:35.640 --> 39:40.920]  contact at every major station and every major newspaper and zero had covered it
[39:40.920 --> 39:44.800]  air America is the only radio station that's covered it and you Alex and
[39:44.800 --> 39:49.720]  nobody else has talked about this nobody's posted this this is absolutely
[39:49.720 --> 39:54.960]  appalling Don I miss gets fired for making a racial joke or a racial slur
[39:54.960 --> 39:59.440]  and this individual nobody's trying to do anything about this guy openly saying
[39:59.440 --> 40:02.560]  that we should be hunted down while limbaugh gets in trouble for saying they
[40:02.560 --> 40:05.640]  want black quarterbacks whether it's true or not you know they give them a
[40:05.640 --> 40:09.840]  better you know more chances and he almost lost his job but the meanwhile
[40:09.840 --> 40:16.680]  Michael Reagan is saying kill mark dice and kill others kill them now now in an
[40:16.680 --> 40:20.080]  age where somebody can just make a few clicks on a keyboard and find somebody's
[40:20.080 --> 40:23.640]  home address this is a very very dangerous territory that we're getting
[40:23.640 --> 40:27.240]  into and I think that Michael Reagan's felt the backlash on this I know that
[40:27.240 --> 40:30.680]  his name and his address have been circulating around and and I don't know
[40:30.680 --> 40:33.640]  what he's going to do I don't advocate anybody harassing him or calling me
[40:33.640 --> 40:37.360]  neither but it's his fault he opened the door he did it yeah and not only that
[40:37.360 --> 40:40.720]  his producer when his producer called me to book me on the show he said that
[40:40.720 --> 40:43.920]  their lawyers want me to take down the audio clip I told them that it was
[40:43.920 --> 40:47.920]  under fair use that it's newsworthy it's a death threat it's evidence of a crime
[40:47.920 --> 40:52.360]  yeah so now that's obstruction of justice and he said his lawyers disagree I
[40:52.360 --> 40:55.640]  told him I disagree and now it's all over the web other people have posted it
[40:55.640 --> 40:59.080]  that video you just get at the fact that it's now out that they want it down it's
[40:59.080 --> 41:02.280]  over it's everywhere I don't think they knew how big of a backlash this was
[41:02.280 --> 41:05.600]  going to be they probably thought that I called the producer and demanded that he
[41:05.600 --> 41:09.240]  be fired and we're not going to stop this individual needs to be fired I want
[41:09.240 --> 41:13.600]  everybody to go to the FCC's website or go to my website and click on the link
[41:13.600 --> 41:18.560]  that'll take you how to exactly file an official complaint with the FCC and link
[41:18.560 --> 41:22.160]  the date and the time that this and I want to be clear if we let this type of
[41:22.160 --> 41:25.240]  precedent be set where they're allowed to call for our murder that's what
[41:25.240 --> 41:27.880]  happened in Nazi Germany they would call for people's murder on the radio
[41:27.880 --> 41:32.040]  stormtroopers would go out and kill people they the Democrats are then
[41:32.040 --> 41:35.880]  going to use that in seven eight months and there already are other cases of it
[41:35.880 --> 41:39.400]  to then go shut down free speech and bring in the fairness doctrine which
[41:39.400 --> 41:43.840]  I'm against look I mean if some of these talk show hosts have said I should be
[41:43.840 --> 41:47.000]  tried for treason and then executed they're allowed to say that I if they
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.440]  want to say I should be tried for treason and then executed after due
[41:49.440 --> 41:54.240]  process that's fine I say some of them should be tried for treason and then
[41:54.240 --> 41:57.960]  later after a jury of their peers and due process they should be executed some
[41:57.960 --> 42:02.240]  of these new world order people but that's the process you don't say no judge no
[42:02.240 --> 42:06.680]  jury you go out you find Mark Dyson you killing I mean do you have any idea what
[42:06.680 --> 42:09.960]  will happen if anything happens to you mark or anybody else just the civil
[42:09.960 --> 42:13.600]  ramifications of this alone or insane yeah and it was he wasn't stating his
[42:13.600 --> 42:16.840]  opinion he wasn't saying that he hopes it happens that he think it should happen
[42:16.840 --> 42:21.040]  he was giving a direct order he mentioned it five times five times and he
[42:21.040 --> 42:24.560]  wanted to pay for the bullets this is absolutely right there's more folks we
[42:24.560 --> 42:28.280]  only played the tip of the iceberg or stay there mark dies we're gonna come

[48:31.280 --> 48:35.520]  woman your husband got me pregnant I'm gonna have his baby you know totally made
[48:35.520 --> 48:38.480]  up and then they called him said how about we burn your house down and get
[48:38.480 --> 48:42.480]  your kids yeah I mean this is the type of stuff they're doing and then I've
[48:42.480 --> 48:45.640]  been death-threaded plenty by talks your host saying I need to be killed but to
[48:45.640 --> 48:50.120]  have them contracting saying I will pay you to kill mark dice and others is a
[48:50.120 --> 48:54.400]  big deal mark dies I mean this affects everybody if they're allowed to get on
[48:54.400 --> 49:00.000]  talk radio the adopted son of Ronald Reagan the fake conservative and sit
[49:00.000 --> 49:05.600]  there and say kill us that shows they're really getting desperate mark he needs to
[49:05.600 --> 49:08.640]  be held accountable not only does he need to be fired he needs to be charged
[49:08.640 --> 49:13.720]  criminally the FCC needs to be made aware of this he's also made comments
[49:13.720 --> 49:17.760]  about his solution for peace in the Middle East which includes things that I
[49:17.760 --> 49:21.600]  can't even say I don't even want to repeat on air it involves doing certain
[49:21.600 --> 49:26.880]  things with hand grenades to young children and young babies go ahead and
[49:26.880 --> 49:32.760]  say it he wants to shove hand grenades into certain orifices of children in the
[49:32.760 --> 49:36.680]  Middle East and blow them up and kill everybody as Pastor Hague he said he
[49:36.680 --> 49:41.200]  prays and rejoices every time a child dies in Palestine I mean again they do
[49:41.200 --> 49:45.760]  this scientifically when the White House wrote memos saying rip children's
[49:45.760 --> 49:48.960]  genitals off with pliers in front of their parents they knew that if they
[49:48.960 --> 49:51.600]  could get the troops to accept that they would have had them all the way
[49:51.600 --> 49:55.400]  psychologically you've made a deal with the devil you've accepted evil now
[49:55.400 --> 50:00.080]  you'll do anything else they say and US funded death squads in Latin America have
[50:00.080 --> 50:05.440]  done this now those death squads are here let's talk about and again it's
[50:05.440 --> 50:09.280]  destroyed the name of conservatism it's destroyed our country all these people
[50:09.280 --> 50:12.560]  do is destroy this country just like the Democrats but they're even worse in
[50:12.560 --> 50:16.040]  that they've got conservatives fooled they're all going along with gun
[50:16.040 --> 50:21.480]  control open borders the North American Union all of this they love wars because
[50:21.480 --> 50:24.880]  they could put trillions in a year into black holes no big contrast they
[50:24.880 --> 50:28.560]  admittedly pay off the troops hundreds of thousands in cash to keep quiet not
[50:28.560 --> 50:31.880]  just the merc forces but tell folks about the type of death threats you've
[50:31.880 --> 50:37.120]  gotten since he did this in the middle of last week oh man I've deleted so
[50:37.120 --> 50:42.400]  many of them a lot of people wish me death I've just gotten countless of
[50:42.400 --> 50:46.960]  my forwarded them several of them to the FBI to the case officer that's on the
[50:46.960 --> 50:52.920]  case I had somebody find me at my work at my day job and call me try to find
[50:52.920 --> 50:57.760]  me and I just want to make everything clear here that this man needs to be
[50:57.760 --> 51:03.320]  taken off the air this can't be set a precedent he is that this is more than
[51:03.320 --> 51:08.360]  just hate speech this is a criminal go ahead yeah this is a criminal
[51:08.360 --> 51:15.600]  prosecutable offense here and there's nothing that is justifiable for him to
[51:15.600 --> 51:20.280]  be able to do this well mark imagine if I got on air and and pick the public
[51:20.280 --> 51:24.000]  figure or anybody else and said I want them dead I'll pay for the bullets go
[51:24.000 --> 51:28.160]  kill them they need to die kill them now people take that with a lot of respect a
[51:28.160 --> 51:31.720]  lot of moral authority of this big national talk show host that I mean I
[51:31.720 --> 51:37.160]  would be arrested within hours guaranteed I mean other hosts for things
[51:37.160 --> 51:42.360]  much more trivial have lost their jobs or been arrested they've been arrested
[51:42.360 --> 51:47.520]  for pranks will Michael Reagan be able to engage in classic terrorism on the
[51:47.520 --> 51:53.040]  year so far looks as yes the determining factors going to be tomorrow and
[51:53.040 --> 51:57.240]  Tuesday when the news cycles will hit again and I want to encourage everybody
[51:57.240 --> 52:01.760]  to just get this out he demand that the need the news media cover this that the
[52:01.760 --> 52:07.520]  FCC take action that his syndicator radio america pull him immediately
[52:07.520 --> 52:11.440]  radio america dot org you can scroll down to the bottom of the screen and
[52:11.440 --> 52:14.840]  find the phone number their offices are closed today but you'll be able to reach
[52:14.840 --> 52:19.320]  them tomorrow it's interesting that his Wikipedia page has been edited numerous
[52:19.320 --> 52:23.520]  times with references to this and it's constantly removed so they're editing
[52:23.520 --> 52:26.880]  his Wikipedia page they don't want this to get out meanwhile they've got
[52:26.880 --> 52:30.840]  this info on my Wikipedia page I wish people could change that but they're
[52:30.840 --> 52:34.520]  literally on it 24 hours a day watching my page and they've got all this
[52:34.520 --> 52:38.520]  disinfo up there I'm so sick of all their lies you know what but they're
[52:38.520 --> 52:41.160]  making trillions off bringing this country down so they're not going to let
[52:41.160 --> 52:44.160]  us wake up because if the people do wake up then they're all going to go to
[52:44.160 --> 52:48.440]  prison I mean can there be any doubt that this shows that they're cornered
[52:48.440 --> 52:52.800]  rats they are so afraid of citizens you know that the government says reach out
[52:52.800 --> 52:56.480]  to the troops and the packages and the material why not send them ABC news
[52:56.480 --> 53:00.600]  headline US government plan to terrorize its own citizen stage terror attacks
[53:00.600 --> 53:05.000]  why not send them Baltimore Sun why not send them San Jose Mercury news why not
[53:05.000 --> 53:09.240]  send them my film terror storm I mean why not let them know the truth yep this
[53:09.240 --> 53:13.840]  this is caused people who hate me and who call me a lunatic to side with us
[53:13.840 --> 53:17.480]  I've seen countless blogs and countless statements on the YouTube videos of
[53:17.480 --> 53:21.360]  people that say that they think that I'm a lunatic they hate me but this is
[53:21.360 --> 53:25.120]  crossed the line and and I don't know what Reagan thinks is going to come
[53:25.120 --> 53:28.720]  about this but he should be off the air immediately I'm going to demand that he
[53:28.720 --> 53:33.720]  is fired and that he resigned when I'm on his show tomorrow morning he is on
[53:33.720 --> 53:38.760]  American they are the ones that are on watch out we don't want that word of
[53:38.760 --> 53:41.680]  that getting to him but the point here is he probably thinks he's going to come
[53:41.680 --> 53:44.840]  on glad hand you pat you on the head you're going to care that he's got a
[53:44.840 --> 53:48.240]  couple radio listeners bunch of people on life support most of them I feel sorry
[53:48.240 --> 53:52.320]  for them but they're just you know all on Prozac and all on flu shots their
[53:52.320 --> 53:55.520]  brains are the size of walnuts and you know they think open borders is
[53:55.520 --> 53:58.240]  conservative I mean you're not going to be able to and I love I was listening
[53:58.240 --> 54:02.760]  to Reagan Friday because all this horse sit-in hosts and it was all about how
[54:02.760 --> 54:06.040]  we've got to get the Republican Party back we got to do something people are
[54:06.040 --> 54:09.800]  mad they all went along with what's happened in the Republican Party they
[54:09.800 --> 54:14.280]  are not conservatives none of these shows will tell you that the oil prices are
[54:14.280 --> 54:17.400]  as high as they are because they devalue the dollar let me explain something
[54:17.400 --> 54:21.960]  there's no way to get around this neocon listeners the government and the
[54:21.960 --> 54:25.880]  private Federal Reserve made the decision to devalue the dollar they have
[54:25.880 --> 54:30.400]  destroyed our savings they have destroyed our future already 60 plus
[54:30.400 --> 54:35.720]  percent reduction anyway you cut it do you read me do it current trends the
[54:35.720 --> 54:40.440]  dollar will be worth 10 percent of what it was in two years and it's can you
[54:40.440 --> 54:45.200]  understand it's over depression you understand they did it so the foreign
[54:45.200 --> 54:49.280]  corporations could come in and buy up our infrastructure cheaper can you say
[54:49.280 --> 54:53.960]  looting and it isn't about Republicans or Democrats or all your fake neocon
[54:53.960 --> 55:00.600]  flag worship what that flag symbolizes is being destroyed you idiots I'm just so
[55:00.600 --> 55:05.320]  angry about this mark I love this country so much and this phony group of
[55:05.320 --> 55:09.440]  crooks has come in posed as conservatives fooled everybody and now
[55:09.440 --> 55:13.640]  they're gang raping us with the Democrats gas over here in California at a
[55:13.640 --> 55:18.600]  gas station I just passed is 479 for regular at another competing gas
[55:18.600 --> 55:22.640]  station it was 459 it's climbing yeah here in Texas and we got the
[55:22.640 --> 55:26.960]  refineries all right here there's there's chickens that you could buy at the
[55:26.960 --> 55:30.520]  grocery store not too long ago there were 499 they're already made I'm sure
[55:30.520 --> 55:34.040]  every grocery store has them they're under a heat lamp you can buy them take
[55:34.040 --> 55:37.920]  them home and eat them immediately they're now 699 I like those prices are
[55:37.920 --> 55:42.240]  just skyrocketing here and you know Alex is one of the only hosts that is
[55:42.240 --> 55:45.560]  going to tell people the truth despite the consequences these people are not
[55:45.560 --> 55:49.040]  going to give up their ivory towers and they're they're six and sometimes seven
[55:49.040 --> 55:54.080]  figure salaries their book deals their access to these politicians and all they
[55:54.080 --> 55:57.840]  do is churn out bold of the the the Democrats churn something out that
[55:57.840 --> 56:02.560]  doesn't reflect reality one iota the republicans put out a false reality it
[56:02.560 --> 56:06.640]  isn't real they're all on the same team don't you understand they're now death
[56:06.640 --> 56:11.040]  threatening us now we had on an expert from the Smithsonian Institute about
[56:11.040 --> 56:15.240]  death squads Friday and he said he believes from covering death squads for
[56:15.240 --> 56:19.840]  25 years that this was a green light threat to all of us he is a top white
[56:19.840 --> 56:23.320]  house strategist he admittedly goes to the White House for talking points this
[56:23.320 --> 56:26.560]  is a threat mark and I hope they know we're not backing down we're going to
[56:26.560 --> 56:30.120]  defend this country from these new world order traders who are who are destroying
[56:30.120 --> 56:33.440]  this nation and we've talked off there about this and I think that one of the
[56:33.440 --> 56:37.400]  only reasons that you haven't been whacked or murdered is because they're
[56:37.400 --> 56:40.960]  afraid of the backlash and and and maybe they haven't considered this but there
[56:40.960 --> 56:45.160]  are some unstable listeners to the show there's some unstable supporters of the
[56:45.160 --> 56:48.560]  truth movement and if something happens to you or to another prominent
[56:48.560 --> 56:52.640]  individual some of these individuals might take justice into their own hands
[56:52.640 --> 56:56.840]  and and commit crimes and and break the code of conduct that we've got we don't
[56:56.840 --> 57:01.160]  want that to happen we don't want the cities to burn we don't want people to
[57:01.160 --> 57:05.240]  get whacked you know just stop escalating stop attacking us stop
[57:05.240 --> 57:10.000]  threatening us leave us alone we have our first amendment we wouldn't be getting
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.640]  threatened if it wasn't endangering their apple cart now this just goes to show
[57:14.640 --> 57:17.640]  that we're being extremely effective they're turning the rhetoric up this is
[57:17.640 --> 57:22.880]  an unprecedented level a few months ago we could have never imagined that such a
[57:22.880 --> 57:25.960]  thing were to happen well we got governors coming out best actress coming

[1:06:24.720 --> 1:06:30.080]  ends I'll give you a brief rundown of what happened there talking to Mark
[1:06:30.080 --> 1:06:34.440]  Dice and taking your phone calls right now Mark Dice is the author of the
[1:06:34.440 --> 1:06:38.680]  resistance manifesto his book just sold out it's been out for about two years
[1:06:38.680 --> 1:06:44.560]  he's got a new edition coming out in the next few weeks he is media activist got
[1:06:44.560 --> 1:06:49.840]  a lot of attention on a bunch of issues but he's mainly a 9-11 truther and he
[1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:54.520]  had the idea of sending books and videos and one of my films and materials to the
[1:06:54.520 --> 1:06:59.440]  troops so so they'd know that the PNAC said the vice president wrote that they
[1:06:59.440 --> 1:07:03.640]  wanted big terror attacks to have a pretext to invade and that it's all a
[1:07:03.640 --> 1:07:06.920]  line and we know they lied to us about everything it's now mainstream news they
[1:07:06.920 --> 1:07:10.600]  wanted to shoot down one of our planes and blame it on Saddam White House memo
[1:07:10.600 --> 1:07:14.560]  London Guardian Associated Press I mean what we're not allowed as Americans to
[1:07:14.560 --> 1:07:20.720]  do that but it's simple global interest wanted to want to dissolve this country
[1:07:20.720 --> 1:07:27.000]  and use a tyrannical government to force transfer our assets to them it is now
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:33.760]  happening right now so let's go ahead and go back to Mark Dice here mark anything
[1:07:33.760 --> 1:07:36.960]  else you want to add before we go back to calls you know I want to just urge
[1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:40.480]  everybody to get involved with operation inform the soldiers that's where
[1:07:40.480 --> 1:07:45.640]  we're sending DVDs of terror storm a loose change final cut to the troops
[1:07:45.640 --> 1:07:50.440]  writing them personal letters personal emails you can go to my site mark dice
[1:07:50.440 --> 1:07:55.040]  calm and scroll down and find the info about operation inform the soldiers
[1:07:55.040 --> 1:07:58.560]  you're gonna have to register with a couple of services or through some
[1:07:58.560 --> 1:08:02.240]  churches to get access to the to the soldiers to get their names and their
[1:08:02.240 --> 1:08:05.720]  addresses you can't do it through the Department of Defense there's certain
[1:08:05.720 --> 1:08:09.080]  private organizations that are nonprofit that will set up all this
[1:08:09.080 --> 1:08:13.120]  information for you so if you don't have the money to send them some packages to
[1:08:13.120 --> 1:08:16.920]  send them some letters you can sign up an email the troops back and forth and
[1:08:16.920 --> 1:08:20.720]  we're trying to create a climate that's safe for the troops to address these
[1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:25.920]  issues I personally know several US Marines active duty that have been to
[1:08:25.920 --> 1:08:30.680]  Iraq who know that 9-11's an inside job people in their unit believe it it's
[1:08:30.680 --> 1:08:34.040]  still not safe enough for them to start addressing these issues with their
[1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:38.320]  superiors and with others so we need to create a safe climate for them to
[1:08:38.320 --> 1:08:42.600]  foster a discussion and once the troops know this it's gonna filter all the way
[1:08:42.600 --> 1:08:46.320]  up back well let me tell you the troops do know it's come out in all the
[1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:50.520]  foreign papers and even a few of ours that British Israeli and US special
[1:08:50.520 --> 1:08:54.600]  forces and contractors have been caught dressed up as Arabs with fake
[1:08:54.600 --> 1:08:59.760]  beards on running around shooting and killing Iraqi security forces and our
[1:08:59.760 --> 1:09:03.440]  own troops now people say why would they do that well first they wanted to say oh
[1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:07.360]  we can't leave in the first four years there's too much of a conflict that's a
[1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:11.480]  strategy of tension that's depending on documents and then now they're paying off
[1:09:11.480 --> 1:09:15.760]  the warlords and then and and then occasionally stirring things back up to
[1:09:15.760 --> 1:09:20.600]  say oh look we've you know we fixed the security problem we've got to stay there
[1:09:20.600 --> 1:09:24.200]  so this was their strategy from the beginning and look most the troops I
[1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:28.080]  talked to are great people they know what's going on but if tyranny is gonna
[1:09:28.080 --> 1:09:31.400]  come to your door it's gonna come in a uniform and these guys are all over in
[1:09:31.400 --> 1:09:34.720]  full wars message board all over the present planet message board they'll put
[1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:40.480]  their handle they are Marines you know they'll say I'm gonna kill you and you'll
[1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:43.760]  go to their website their own personal site and it's them and their and their
[1:09:43.760 --> 1:09:47.520]  troops these are brainwashed crazies these are the type that throw puppies off
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:50.840]  cliffs and shoot little kids and laugh about it there's video of all that the
[1:09:50.840 --> 1:09:55.440]  neocons tried to deny that but now it's admitted it's happening and so again
[1:09:55.440 --> 1:09:59.120]  they want to come back and become police officers we've got to stop that folks
[1:09:59.120 --> 1:10:03.760]  the globalist are doing this by design they start these wars to create the
[1:10:03.760 --> 1:10:07.080]  psychos they need to bring them back domestically and rule over the
[1:10:07.080 --> 1:10:11.200]  population mark let's take a call let's talk to ray and Bastrop Texas has a
[1:10:11.200 --> 1:10:18.080]  question for you go ahead right okay ray you're on the air go ahead thanks for
[1:10:18.080 --> 1:10:24.520]  taking my call mark have you thought about possibly pursuing a civil libel suit
[1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:29.920]  against Michael Reagan it seems like when he names you personally that you
[1:10:29.920 --> 1:10:34.240]  might have it you know and you might get a lot of support from other listeners
[1:10:34.240 --> 1:10:37.800]  and the people who support you well let me tell you what he can do civilly he
[1:10:37.800 --> 1:10:42.040]  can sue him to cease and assist the terroristic threats and get an injunction
[1:10:42.040 --> 1:10:45.520]  there's no judge that after hearing that and then being presented all the
[1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:49.920]  threats marks getting who would not say there's an injunction on Michael Reagan
[1:10:49.920 --> 1:10:54.920]  from saying kill mark dies or anybody else inside the US so what he can get is
[1:10:54.920 --> 1:10:59.160]  a civil injunction mark yeah the the case officer that's on the case that I'm
[1:10:59.160 --> 1:11:03.280]  working with with the FBI knows that he's invited me on the show and then
[1:11:03.280 --> 1:11:08.760]  allegedly will apologize and I'm over the course of the next few days we're
[1:11:08.760 --> 1:11:12.600]  gonna decide what we can do what are the legal actions that we can take in yeah
[1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:17.840]  he may claim that he's apologizing and I don't think that he believes that you
[1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:21.840]  know he's he's in the wrong here I think that he just understands that his his
[1:11:21.840 --> 1:11:26.120]  show and his career is in jeopardy and listen we've all said things off the
[1:11:26.120 --> 1:11:30.760]  top of our head later on reflecting or even just a few seconds after saying
[1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:34.560]  them understand okay that that's wrong I shouldn't be saying that but I don't
[1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:38.400]  think that that's the case with him I think that he's he fully believes no
[1:11:38.400 --> 1:11:42.080]  he said if you have a problem with it come on let's get it on yeah this wasn't
[1:11:42.080 --> 1:11:45.560]  just one one instance that he made us over and over again let me just add here
[1:11:45.560 --> 1:11:50.520]  that again calling for people's murder for their first amendment saying go out
[1:11:50.520 --> 1:11:55.480]  and kill them I'll pay you to kill him he solicited murder he must be arrested
[1:11:55.480 --> 1:12:00.040]  right well let me add one other thing because I think the the question of
[1:12:00.040 --> 1:12:03.520]  whether or not what he said is protected speech you know can only really be
[1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:07.480]  decided not always it's not I understand that that you know that on the
[1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:12.560]  surface it doesn't appear to be a lawyer the other thing I'd want to add is you
[1:12:12.560 --> 1:12:17.320]  know another way to seems like this guy because he does have to spend money
[1:12:17.320 --> 1:12:21.360]  defending himself but to go after the underwriters go I mean it seems like
[1:12:21.360 --> 1:12:24.760]  there'd be enough people whether or not they were for your cost politically who
[1:12:24.760 --> 1:12:30.360]  would be a fit you know what he what he said that you know that's generally what
[1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:34.040]  will happen with yeah you know your phone's bad I'm gonna let you go it's
[1:12:34.040 --> 1:12:38.320]  cutting out every other word look the bottom line here is this we can't let
[1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:42.760]  them set a precedent to call for our murder and then be murdered and they
[1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:46.600]  said if they're saying now kill this person now kill that person kill this
[1:12:46.600 --> 1:12:51.360]  person kill that person kill kill kill kill kill kill cuz America's about not
[1:12:51.360 --> 1:12:54.360]  having the right to talk to the troops America's about having the right to sit
[1:12:54.360 --> 1:12:57.880]  down and shut up and have a taser crammed down your throat let's go ahead
[1:12:57.880 --> 1:13:01.760]  and take another call here let's go ahead and talk to John in Kentucky John

[1:13:22.880 --> 1:13:25.960]  12th I think I've heard anybody else talking about this but I think we need
[1:13:25.960 --> 1:13:29.840]  to make this a national nationwide thing you know if you can't make it to DC you
[1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:33.080]  don't have the money anything like that that's fine but what starts something you

[1:13:35.880 --> 1:13:38.720]  have something across the entire US so they can't just say oh the crazy Ron

[1:16:51.720 --> 1:16:54.700]  the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the
[1:16:54.700 --> 1:16:58.760]  risks of deficit spending therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no
[1:16:58.760 --> 1:17:02.120]  surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash
[1:17:02.120 --> 1:17:05.520]  depositors can remove from their accounts a fractional reserve system
[1:17:05.520 --> 1:17:09.200]  means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate
[1:17:09.200 --> 1:17:12.840]  withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government
[1:17:12.840 --> 1:17:16.360]  is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed
[1:17:16.360 --> 1:17:20.560]  economy a current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks
[1:17:20.560 --> 1:17:24.280]  to increase liquidity for depositors however an increase in money supply
[1:17:24.280 --> 1:17:28.520]  without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve
[1:17:28.520 --> 1:17:32.920]  strength and stability I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to
[1:17:32.920 --> 1:17:37.280]  be calmly repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently
[1:17:37.280 --> 1:17:42.440]  have been driven by debt gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years for

[1:22:25.560 --> 1:22:29.080]  anywhere the show airs makes it a jurisdiction but the fact that you're
[1:22:29.080 --> 1:22:32.560]  in Southern California to mark you got him and we got to get this little bugger
[1:22:32.560 --> 1:22:37.280]  to at least be arrested because it is it is so important let's go ahead and

[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:47.520]  advice actually the advice is exactly what was just given and he I'm not
[1:22:47.520 --> 1:22:51.640]  exactly sure where Michael Reagan's studio is but I think it's in West
[1:22:51.640 --> 1:22:55.960]  Los Angeles which is under the jurisdiction of the LAPD van eyes is
[1:22:55.960 --> 1:23:01.600]  also policed by the LAPD so if the crime was done in Los Angeles they have
[1:23:01.600 --> 1:23:07.280]  jurisdiction and they should prop they should prosecute you know take it
[1:23:07.280 --> 1:23:10.600]  directly to the LAPD or he's allowed to get up on air until four million
[1:23:10.600 --> 1:23:13.520]  listeners go murder this person I will pay for it kill him now
[1:23:13.520 --> 1:23:17.280]  just open crime committed unbelievable yeah but it should be
[1:23:17.280 --> 1:23:22.240]  should be pursued right here in Los Angeles and I have personal experience
[1:23:22.240 --> 1:23:29.280]  here recently in credit card fraud I found a good police officer that
[1:23:29.280 --> 1:23:33.960]  prosecuted the case and there wasn't a restmate and the individuals now
[1:23:33.960 --> 1:23:39.240]  facing the bar of justice so there are a lot of cops that aren't going to be
[1:23:39.240 --> 1:23:42.800]  bothered by this but then there are some good policemen there no that's it in
[1:23:42.800 --> 1:23:45.440]  fact a lot of them are good you just got to get around the bad ones in fact I've
[1:23:45.440 --> 1:23:48.040]  talked to some people that have called the FBI other offices and they'll say
[1:23:48.040 --> 1:23:51.960]  well do you think it's 9-11's an inside job maybe he shouldn't be talking like
[1:23:51.960 --> 1:23:56.400]  that I mean that is such a criminal action right there this is a serious
[1:23:56.400 --> 1:24:03.000]  crime it's definitely contracting a capital murder and Mark Dice is
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:07.440]  accumulating the evidence with all the death threats that that's an open
[1:24:07.440 --> 1:24:11.040]  showcase all right thank you sir appreciate that advice let's talk to

[1:24:56.440 --> 1:24:59.040]  they're the ones escalating it and it's something that might become
[1:24:59.040 --> 1:25:05.120]  potentially unpeaceful and unfortunately and I don't have a crystal ball but I've
[1:25:05.120 --> 1:25:11.040]  studied enough history to know in my heart that I see blood and and it's
[1:25:11.040 --> 1:25:16.000]  really a sad thing yeah bullies are gonna keep shoving and pushing and
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:20.520]  shooting and till they get their rear ends plowed and I and I don't want this
[1:25:20.520 --> 1:25:24.440]  to happen but now they do I this government is a lying pack of criminals

[1:33:14.040 --> 1:33:18.280]  your constitutions they denied the European Union existed for its first
[1:33:18.280 --> 1:33:27.200]  45 years then in around the year 2000 they admitted that it existed and now
[1:33:27.200 --> 1:33:30.880]  everybody knows there's a European Union some Americans on the streets say it's
[1:33:30.880 --> 1:33:35.160]  a conspiracy say that doesn't exist it's very childlike just incredible
[1:33:35.160 --> 1:33:38.720]  brainwashing that we have in the public where oh there's a threat to your
[1:33:38.720 --> 1:33:41.640]  liberty that doesn't exist everything's fine I'm gonna go back to you know just
[1:33:41.640 --> 1:33:47.600]  watching TV again ladies and gentlemen they don't allow other European Union
[1:33:47.600 --> 1:33:51.680]  countries to vote they're just forced into it the people can't vote three
[1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:55.200]  times they've had votes out of 20 plus countries that have entered and all three
[1:33:55.200 --> 1:33:58.840]  nations have said no but still France and the Netherlands and Ireland to a
[1:33:58.840 --> 1:34:03.240]  certain extent are still under EU control you because they pay off the
[1:34:03.240 --> 1:34:07.880]  governments kind of like 99% of Texans don't want central from Spain putting
[1:34:07.880 --> 1:34:11.720]  toll roads on existing roads and they just do it and then CNN comes on and
[1:34:11.720 --> 1:34:16.200]  says doesn't exist there's no trans-Texas corridor I've played the clip here
[1:34:16.200 --> 1:34:19.520]  they say doesn't exist doesn't matter the billboards are up and it's happening
[1:34:19.520 --> 1:34:24.480]  they talked to us like children now I want to shift gears in the first
[1:34:24.480 --> 1:34:29.320]  amendment I've got a big stack of news here today we're environmental groups in
[1:34:29.320 --> 1:34:32.560]  major cities are being banned from 10 people standing on the street corner
[1:34:32.560 --> 1:34:37.640]  protesting outside a chemical plant that's had leaks they just say no we're
[1:34:37.640 --> 1:34:42.080]  not and first they say kind of like they did in New York they say well you've
[1:34:42.080 --> 1:34:46.040]  got to have a permit to own a gun and then they stop issuing the permits see
[1:34:46.040 --> 1:34:49.320]  a permit is a right to do something that would be illegal that's what a permit
[1:34:49.320 --> 1:34:53.320]  or license is and then now they say the same thing oh you got a permit to have
[1:34:53.320 --> 1:34:59.120]  a rally or to march and then oh well we don't offer those permits anymore and
[1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:02.240]  then see a lot of it sounds reasonable if you want to block the road for a
[1:35:02.240 --> 1:35:05.600]  parade you need a permit that's just to shut down a street but then people get
[1:35:05.600 --> 1:35:08.960]  used to getting a permit and now oh you want to stand on the street corner and
[1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:11.480]  tell them the end is near and Jesus is coming or you want to stand on the
[1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:16.760]  street corner and you know tell people that the dam's not safe or you want to
[1:35:16.760 --> 1:35:22.720]  tell people that you think taxes are too high whatever it is or that you love the
[1:35:22.720 --> 1:35:26.440]  Iraq war or that you hate the Iraq war or that you think Bush is a wonderful
[1:35:26.440 --> 1:35:29.720]  person or you think Obama's a wonderful person it doesn't matter that's
[1:35:29.720 --> 1:35:33.560]  protected speech and on the Austin police have lost hundreds of suits they
[1:35:33.560 --> 1:35:37.680]  just lost another one two months ago for hundreds of thousands of dollars for
[1:35:37.680 --> 1:35:41.440]  arresting people on the street corner you know if you've got a sandwich board
[1:35:41.440 --> 1:35:45.480]  out advertising a tax-preparing service or advertising a restaurant they leave
[1:35:45.480 --> 1:35:49.240]  you alone but the minute you go out there and complain about the government
[1:35:49.240 --> 1:35:52.400]  boy they pull up right here in Austin they say turn your camera off you're not
[1:35:52.400 --> 1:35:55.600]  allowed to be here got to have a permit I just say go ahead and arrest me I'm
[1:35:55.600 --> 1:35:59.480]  gonna sue you personally you may even beat me in court but you're gonna go
[1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:02.800]  along for the ride and they're like how are you being so mean to me and I'm
[1:36:02.800 --> 1:36:05.320]  like why are you trying to violate my first amendment threatening to arrest me
[1:36:05.320 --> 1:36:11.560]  I'm a human being too bubba and I got them on video just type Alex protest Perry
[1:36:11.560 --> 1:36:15.240]  into Google and you can or YouTube you can go watch it they walk over and say
[1:36:15.240 --> 1:36:19.720]  I'm we're gonna arrest you go ahead go ahead and rest away Pally well but the
[1:36:19.720 --> 1:36:23.440]  point is that is happening in Vancouver Canada same thing all over the West it's
[1:36:23.440 --> 1:36:28.240]  the same global plan they're protesting inside they get thrown out for asking
[1:36:28.240 --> 1:36:32.040]  questions of Colin Powell then when they get outside their camera guy who never
[1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:35.160]  even came in gets arrested that made the news and the police just say well
[1:36:35.160 --> 1:36:40.920]  you're you're trespassing on city city sidewalk I mean now this is getting
[1:36:40.920 --> 1:36:45.360]  crazy we've had New York police walk up it's on video and truth rising and say
[1:36:45.360 --> 1:36:48.120]  we're gonna say you got bombs we know you don't have bombs that we're gonna
[1:36:48.120 --> 1:36:52.280]  put you in jail for terrorism stop protesting I mean that's how corrupt
[1:36:52.280 --> 1:36:56.440]  it's gotten we're on video they frame you because they're not worried they've
[1:36:56.440 --> 1:37:01.440]  been ordered to frame you you see I mean folks we are it is so and thank god
[1:37:01.440 --> 1:37:03.840]  all the police and military aren't corrupt or we'd already be in total
[1:37:03.840 --> 1:37:07.480]  martial law that's why they've got a brainwash you that torture is good and
[1:37:07.480 --> 1:37:11.200]  killing us is good so that the average cop and military think all that's okay
[1:37:11.200 --> 1:37:14.040]  now I don't have a lot of time with our guests I want to take more calls get into
[1:37:14.040 --> 1:37:17.280]  some of the other news here and I want to have them back on during the week with
[1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:20.400]  Burma's to talk about Jason Burma's is sitting in for part of the week well I

[1:37:35.480 --> 1:37:39.640]  cops say other panhandlers it's all on video on info wars.com right now they
[1:37:39.640 --> 1:37:42.520]  say you're allowed to have panhandling you know other people can be out here
[1:37:42.520 --> 1:37:46.080]  protesting other people can be out here selling stuff without a permit you can't
[1:37:46.080 --> 1:37:51.000]  hand out those terror storms that Alex Jones film you can't do that and they
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:55.920]  put them in handcuffs and give them tickets so we'll talk to Rob and Travis
[1:37:55.920 --> 1:38:00.200]  Travis we'll just go with Travis because his dad actually works for the
[1:38:00.200 --> 1:38:03.160]  government we don't get him in too much trouble but he was at the event and got
[1:38:03.160 --> 1:38:07.840]  thrown out and then their camera guy outside got arrested so let's go to Rob
[1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:12.840]  from Colorado and Travis from Vancouver let's go to Rob first Rob in a
[1:38:12.840 --> 1:38:18.280]  nutshell what happened to you so we were doing our we were doing our regular
[1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:23.560]  11th of the month action where we get out on the streets we hand out free free
[1:38:23.560 --> 1:38:27.880]  DVDs to all the people we've been doing it for about eight months down on the
[1:38:27.880 --> 1:38:34.040]  16th Street Mall and I think some of the cops you know I mean they don't really
[1:38:34.040 --> 1:38:37.800]  enjoy it but they've been tolerating it well let's be clear this is for first
[1:38:37.800 --> 1:38:42.280]  amendment they should love it that's why they have some freedom and by mall it's
[1:38:42.280 --> 1:38:47.120]  outside area city you know public property yeah it is not a private mall
[1:38:47.120 --> 1:38:50.960]  they told us it was a private mall I've already outside when it happens to be
[1:38:50.960 --> 1:38:55.640]  clear it shops but it's in the middle of the city yeah they call it a mall but
[1:38:55.640 --> 1:39:00.920]  it is on the city and county Denver and the police clearly told us that it
[1:39:00.920 --> 1:39:07.040]  wasn't you need to sue them okay tell us what happened yeah so I'm handing out a
[1:39:07.040 --> 1:39:10.760]  DVD to someone we're being polite we're staying out of the way of the thoroughfare
[1:39:10.760 --> 1:39:16.480]  and a cop rolls up on me and he says well he walks up to me and he says hey
[1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:20.720]  you need to stop that you're peddling and I said and I looked at him I was like
[1:39:20.720 --> 1:39:25.120]  well I thought peddling was selling stuff and he said and and I didn't
[1:39:25.120 --> 1:39:29.320]  immediately stop and it angered him and he said you need to stop that you're
[1:39:29.320 --> 1:39:34.640]  peddling and I said I said isn't peddling selling stuff and I didn't I
[1:39:34.640 --> 1:39:40.120]  didn't jump to when he said and yeah slave he's like drop your stuff here and
[1:39:40.120 --> 1:39:43.600]  then he put me in cops right there you're lucky he didn't taser you till you
[1:39:43.600 --> 1:39:48.080]  died yeah that's the new punishment death is the new punishment for freedom
[1:39:48.080 --> 1:39:53.160]  and lay off slaves home of the coward red coat run and owned okay so how did
[1:39:53.160 --> 1:40:00.080]  all this in just with the ticketing yeah but tell folks yeah so he wrote me
[1:40:00.080 --> 1:40:03.520]  out a ticket for peddling and then by the time I got it it also had obstructing
[1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:07.520]  the sidewalk on there okay and then more false charges more destruction of
[1:40:07.520 --> 1:40:13.440]  America yeah and then he talked with this with this pavilion mall security and
[1:40:13.440 --> 1:40:17.840]  she had come by earlier and told us hey we need to move our stuff away from the
[1:40:17.840 --> 1:40:21.600]  mall from the building itself about a foot and a half out because that's where
[1:40:21.600 --> 1:40:26.600]  the the public property starts so we were like okay and we did that and she
[1:40:26.600 --> 1:40:29.960]  looked around and she left she came back and talked to the cops she talked to
[1:40:29.960 --> 1:40:34.560]  these two cops and pre-op private and the next thing I know the cops is hey
[1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:39.720]  give me that ticket back and I was like well why and and yeah this is America
[1:40:39.720 --> 1:40:43.240]  this is what our veterans fought and died for so you can be harassed and
[1:40:43.240 --> 1:40:46.640]  punished for your first amendment so Michael Reagan can say you should be
[1:40:46.640 --> 1:40:50.280]  murdered I mean this is this is this is land of the free home of the brave it's
[1:40:50.280 --> 1:40:53.760]  either free or it didn't you listen to me you little fake liberals and fake
[1:40:53.760 --> 1:40:57.200]  conservatives out there you think you're part of the system you think you're part
[1:40:57.200 --> 1:41:00.800]  of the elite they're raping you right now with your savings it isn't just the
[1:41:00.800 --> 1:41:04.840]  gas you're getting your new world order okay so how did this end them them
[1:41:04.840 --> 1:41:11.000]  then making fun of you basically and that's the end of it yeah yeah just just
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:14.320]  to be clear this this lady came up and she talked to the cops and he's like
[1:41:14.320 --> 1:41:18.400]  yeah you're gonna get another charge of trespassing and and because she told you
[1:41:18.400 --> 1:41:22.240]  to leave and she didn't tell me to leave so I think she had conferred with the
[1:41:22.240 --> 1:41:25.880]  cops and they probably I think maybe they were worried that they didn't have
[1:41:25.880 --> 1:41:29.720]  enough to actually put me in so they charge you with trespassing they charge
[1:41:29.720 --> 1:41:33.840]  me with trespassing and she lied and I told her I said that's a lie and you're
[1:41:33.840 --> 1:41:37.120]  bought and you're bearing false witness against me right now and she just she's
[1:41:37.120 --> 1:41:42.400]  kind of look you need to sue that scumbag yeah yeah they'd love to run

[1:55:05.280 --> 1:55:11.040]  policy where they're covering it and the cops finally on the last day said okay
[1:55:11.040 --> 1:55:13.640]  you're not allowed to protest and I just said go ahead and arrest us and they had
[1:55:13.640 --> 1:55:17.520]  to back off but they got to try to violate those rights I mean it is
[1:55:17.520 --> 1:55:24.200]  terrorism to come up and arrest people and and give them hardcore you know
[1:55:24.200 --> 1:55:29.840]  criminal charges of trespassing because they're on a city street that is
[1:55:29.840 --> 1:55:35.120]  terrorism that is terrorizing you and it's terrorism when fake conservatives who
