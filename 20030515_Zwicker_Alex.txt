[00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:05.943]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.943 --> 00:00:07.704]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.704 --> 00:00:09.466]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.067]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:12.608]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.608 --> 00:00:16.812]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.812 --> 00:00:20.855]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.174 --> 00:00:36.697]  Last year in Portugal, hundreds of former high-level military officers and others met for a 76-hour press conference where they publicly accused the U.S.
[00:00:36.697 --> 00:00:37.837]  government for carrying out 9-1-1.
[00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:44.359]  It was carried by Spanish and Portuguese papers and by a few English papers.
[00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:49.082]  And they went over the evidence of how there was no way 19 hijackers did that.
[00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.982]  Now a bunch of them have been found alive.
[00:00:50.982 --> 00:00:52.663]  The others were trained at U.S.
[00:00:52.663 --> 00:00:56.244]  military bases, their credit cards, their homes, paid for by the FBI.
[00:00:56.244 --> 00:01:00.705]  We've had David Shippers and everybody else on about this.
[00:01:00.705 --> 00:01:05.466]  Judicial Watch has talked about how the Bushes vacationed with the Bin Ladens on national TVs, talked about it.
[00:01:06.323 --> 00:01:08.585]  The evidence... I've made two films and written a book, folks.
[00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:09.565]  It's a fact.
[00:01:09.565 --> 00:01:19.232]  As the German technology minister said, the globalists, the military-industrial complex carried this out to set up open-world dictatorship.
[00:01:19.232 --> 00:01:19.512]  Okay?
[00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:20.553]  That's the quote.
[00:01:20.553 --> 00:01:22.574]  German ministers are saying it, okay?
[00:01:22.574 --> 00:01:24.535]  I'm not the only one, and I know we're on in D.C.
[00:01:24.535 --> 00:01:25.576]  and everywhere else.
[00:01:25.576 --> 00:01:27.558]  There's thousands of us that are prominent.
[00:01:27.558 --> 00:01:30.940]  Someone who's very prominent is Barry Schweiker.
[00:01:31.847 --> 00:01:34.851]  And he's written for all the big major papers, many of the big papers.
[00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:38.876]  He's the Visions TV media critic, highly respected.
[00:01:38.876 --> 00:01:46.266]  And he's convincing a lot of top journalists that he is correct of some big questions of prior knowledge up in Canada.
[00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:47.908]  And we're honored to have
[00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:50.651]  Very on the show, sir.
[00:01:50.651 --> 00:01:52.914]  Thank you for taking some time out to be with us.
[00:01:52.914 --> 00:01:55.957]  Listen, it's a real pleasure, Alex.
[00:01:55.957 --> 00:02:03.466]  I encountered your face for the first time at the end of that new video called Aftermath, you know?
[00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:05.348]  Unanswered questions from 9-11?
[00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:17.360]  I saw that video in San Francisco last month and I really liked what they had you as the last guy punching out a real call for people to wake up.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.162]  And I really admired that.
[00:02:19.162 --> 00:02:21.224]  So I'm really gratified to be speaking with you.
[00:02:21.784 --> 00:02:22.645]  Well, thank you.
[00:02:22.645 --> 00:02:24.427]  You know, I'll be honest.
[00:02:24.427 --> 00:02:28.332]  If it was some new free country to go to, I'd probably leave, but there's nowhere to run.
[00:02:28.332 --> 00:02:29.954]  It is a new world order.
[00:02:29.954 --> 00:02:33.538]  I don't think people realize how serious things have gotten.
[00:02:33.538 --> 00:02:37.803]  Tell us a little about yourself and the questions you have and some of the key points.
[00:02:38.503 --> 00:02:40.424]  Well, one thing I have to correct you.
[00:02:40.424 --> 00:02:42.205]  I wish I didn't have to correct you.
[00:02:42.205 --> 00:02:47.327]  You said a moment ago that I'm convincing a lot of journalists in Canada that these questions should be asked.
[00:02:47.327 --> 00:02:49.848]  Well, that's kind of what the Toronto Star said, isn't it?
[00:02:49.848 --> 00:02:54.790]  Well, the Toronto Star is the largest circulation newspaper in Canada.
[00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.370]  It's a proud paper.
[00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.231]  I worked for it.
[00:02:57.231 --> 00:02:59.872]  Formerly I was the education editor back in the 70s.
[00:03:01.012 --> 00:03:05.114]  And, um, their best-read columnist is a woman named Michelle Landsberg.
[00:03:05.114 --> 00:03:06.954]  And it happens I've known Michelle for a long time.
[00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:11.396]  We used to work together on the Globe and Mail, which is Canada's national newspaper.
[00:03:11.396 --> 00:03:22.200]  And, uh, Michelle, uh, what happened was Michelle wrote a column on, um, some time ago, maybe a couple or three months ago, and she mentioned how the U.S.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.181]  government is addicted to lying about things.
[00:03:26.656 --> 00:03:34.480]  And she gave a few examples, and I think perhaps she mentioned the infamous Gulf of Tonkin Resolution that became the basis for the whole U.S.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.381]  war in Vietnam.
[00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:39.663]  And before that was over, there were 58,000 of your countrymen were dead.
[00:03:39.663 --> 00:03:42.725]  There were no communist North Vietnamese boats attacking anything.
[00:03:42.725 --> 00:03:43.765]  It was totally made up.
[00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:51.870]  It was completely a fake, totally a fake, and yet it passed unanimously in the House of Representatives and 88 to 2 in the Senate.
[00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.291]  So, she mentioned a couple of things like that.
[00:03:54.291 --> 00:04:00.853]  Well, what happened was, she got a tremendous response via email, and with the internet these days, that's how it goes.
[00:04:00.853 --> 00:04:11.736]  And a lot of the people who emailed her from the USA, from down where you are, said, Michelle, there's a guy in Canada named Barry Zwicker, and he's done a whole video about this.
[00:04:11.736 --> 00:04:19.358]  Well, amazingly, although she and I know each other, and actually, she lives a 10-minute bicycle ride from here, she had never heard of him about my video.
[00:04:20.198 --> 00:04:23.479]  So she phoned up and she said, Barry, I understand you got a video out.
[00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:24.179]  I'd like to see it.
[00:04:24.179 --> 00:04:24.839]  I said, sure.
[00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:34.542]  So I rode it over there in my bicycle and she watched it and she said, she told me right here where I'm sitting in my writing studio, she came over, interviewed me a week ago, Wednesday.
[00:04:34.542 --> 00:04:40.724]  She said, Barry, a cold chill literally came over my body when I was watching your video.
[00:04:41.424 --> 00:04:42.864]  And I said, well, what do you mean?
[00:04:42.864 --> 00:04:43.144]  Hey, watch.
[00:04:43.144 --> 00:04:43.505]  Stay there.
[00:04:43.505 --> 00:04:44.605]  We got a break.
[00:04:44.605 --> 00:04:47.425]  Our guest is Barry Zweiker.
[00:04:47.425 --> 00:04:53.147]  He is a highly respected journalist in Canada, TV critic for Vision TV.
[00:04:53.147 --> 00:04:56.807]  We'll be right back in three minutes with him, and he's doing great work fighting the globalists.
[00:04:56.807 --> 00:04:59.728]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:59.728 --> 00:05:06.349]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:09.330]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:05:11.101 --> 00:05:12.363]  We're talking to Barry Swickard.
[00:05:12.363 --> 00:05:15.649]  He has written for many of the big papers.
[00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:17.853]  Love and Mail, Toronto Star.
[00:05:17.853 --> 00:05:21.459]  He is the Vision TV Media Critic.
[00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:22.201]  Highly respected.
[00:05:23.155 --> 00:05:32.277]  And he's come out and said, hey, the government's lying, there's all sorts of weirdness going on, and other reporters have seen his film and said it sends a cold chill up their spine.
[00:05:32.277 --> 00:05:35.178]  You were continuing, Barry, with your story.
[00:05:35.178 --> 00:05:35.918]  Go ahead.
[00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:36.538]  Well, sure.
[00:05:36.538 --> 00:05:37.138]  Why not?
[00:05:37.138 --> 00:05:38.018]  It's a story.
[00:05:38.018 --> 00:05:44.180]  It's not other journalists, but this particular journalist, Michelle Landsberg, and she is really highly respected in this country.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.702]  And so she asked, as I was saying, for my video.
[00:05:48.702 --> 00:05:49.362]  She watched it.
[00:05:49.362 --> 00:05:54.165]  She told me here in my writing studio, she said a cold chill came over her whole body.
[00:05:54.165 --> 00:05:55.685]  And I said, well, what do you mean?
[00:05:55.685 --> 00:05:58.086]  And she said, well, it wasn't so much what you said.
[00:05:58.086 --> 00:06:01.968]  It was that I, myself, had thought these thoughts.
[00:06:01.968 --> 00:06:03.969]  She was in France, actually, on 9-11.
[00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:07.271]  She watched it on French TV and she couldn't hear any English language.
[00:06:08.011 --> 00:06:24.860]  But she had thought in the days following, gosh that's fishy, and what she said gave her a cold chill was that she, who is a very intellectual and skeptical and wide awake, alert, knowledgeable person, that she had shoved this to the back of her mind.
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.241]  Those are the very words she used.
[00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:29.022]  She shoved it to the back of her mind and it frightened her.
[00:06:29.022 --> 00:06:32.964]  Well the subconscious mind is very powerful when it's faced with something horrifying.
[00:06:32.964 --> 00:06:33.765]  It's like with Hitler.
[00:06:34.165 --> 00:06:38.389]  People kept trying to deny and deny and deny and deny and deny.
[00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:41.792]  That is so right, and you know, I couldn't agree more.
[00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:52.041]  I've just read the new two-volume biography on Hitler by the British historian Ian Kershaw, and I think it's the very best biography that's ever come out.
[00:06:53.041 --> 00:07:01.303]  And he points that out, that group after group after group in Germany would be the labor unions, the churches, the industrialists, the workers, the farmers and everything.
[00:07:01.303 --> 00:07:04.364]  They all found reasons to go along with Hitler.
[00:07:04.364 --> 00:07:06.564]  Of course, they had to be lied to a lot.
[00:07:06.564 --> 00:07:09.045]  Hitler always said he wanted peace, you know.
[00:07:09.045 --> 00:07:10.145]  Always said he wanted peace.
[00:07:10.145 --> 00:07:11.345]  Lied to his teeth.
[00:07:11.345 --> 00:07:13.506]  Laying war plans, saying he wants peace.
[00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:18.288]  And of course, then he had the Reichstag fire, which really mobilized the German public.
[00:07:18.288 --> 00:07:20.189]  I mean, that was an iconic thing.
[00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:22.290]  1933, their parliament burned down.
[00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.930]  Blamed it on a communist.
[00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.652]  And that was how he seized the last bit of power.
[00:07:26.652 --> 00:07:28.573]  He never was properly elected.
[00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:29.973]  It was something like another guy.
[00:07:29.973 --> 00:07:33.955]  And he set up Homeland Security, called Fatherland Security.
[00:07:34.255 --> 00:07:34.715]  Exactly.
[00:07:34.715 --> 00:07:37.157]  This word, Homeland, has bad resonances.
[00:07:37.157 --> 00:07:40.400]  But you know, Alex, I don't know how much we should take for granted.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.143]  Well, we should take nothing for granted about what your listeners believe.
[00:07:44.143 --> 00:07:58.934]  All the varieties of belief they would have on this subject of 9-11 vary from some people who would totally accept the standard narrative that's put out by the government, right on through to those, I include myself among them, who are total skeptics.
[00:07:58.934 --> 00:08:00.375]  I believe there was complicity.
[00:08:00.375 --> 00:08:02.036]  It wasn't just that they let it happen.
[00:08:02.036 --> 00:08:02.957]  There you go.
[00:08:02.957 --> 00:08:03.958]  They helped to make it happen.
[00:08:04.378 --> 00:08:06.380]  Oh, they get it.
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:10.503]  It's an inside job, is really the word they use in crime.
[00:08:10.503 --> 00:08:14.006]  But anyway, what has happened is I started to write a book about this.
[00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:23.589]  And the book of course is dragging along because my life is pretty busy and it's a big subject and the book started to teach me things.
[00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:29.534]  And the book is called Connecting the Dots, The Media, 9-11 and Our Future.
[00:08:29.534 --> 00:08:36.741]  And so what the book is teaching me is that the real subject of the book, Alex, is the nature of belief.
[00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:40.044]  The culture denying in massive denial.
[00:08:41.465 --> 00:08:44.086]  And it's so true.
[00:08:44.086 --> 00:08:57.111]  Now, what my understanding, such as it is, I don't claim to be the smartest guy in the world, but my understanding as it's evolved is this, that denial itself is not a very important thing.
[00:08:57.111 --> 00:08:58.892]  That is, it's the surface.
[00:08:58.892 --> 00:09:01.233]  Here's the comparison I've come up with.
[00:09:01.233 --> 00:09:04.214]  You see an automobile accident, you know, at a corner.
[00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:09.023]  So the automobile accident happened and maybe a couple people hurt and that's that.
[00:09:09.023 --> 00:09:11.967]  Well, that's obvious for everybody to see.
[00:09:11.967 --> 00:09:15.611]  Although granted, people might have different ideas about how it happened.
[00:09:15.611 --> 00:09:18.975]  But the real questions are, why did that thing happen?
[00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:20.795]  How come it happened?
[00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:22.596]  What went into making it happen?
[00:09:22.596 --> 00:09:27.577]  What was the anatomy of the preparation for this accident that then occurred?
[00:09:27.577 --> 00:09:35.779]  Now, when you come to denial, denial is the surface, the last thing that happens when people just refuse to see what's right in front of them.
[00:09:35.779 --> 00:09:39.060]  But the question is, why do they refuse to see what's right in front of them?
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.581]  How could it be that you and I and a lot of people, all
[00:09:43.354 --> 00:09:44.075]  I think so.
[00:09:58.268 --> 00:09:58.968]  I don't know.
[00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:19.523]  Well, exactly.
[00:10:19.523 --> 00:10:21.744]  I mean, the whole thing about George Bush.
[00:10:21.744 --> 00:10:37.394]  And again, the thing is that we all saw, either originally and or in repeats, endless repeats, we saw the famous video of Andy Card going into that classroom with those great two kids in it, whispering into George Bush's ear.
[00:10:37.394 --> 00:10:38.695]  Now, here's a really odd thing.
[00:10:38.695 --> 00:10:40.376]  There's so many odd things about this.
[00:10:40.376 --> 00:10:46.300]  But just let me touch on that for a minute, although you may have already touched on it, perhaps even many times, Alex.
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.721]  Let's continue to touch on it.
[00:10:48.361 --> 00:10:55.606]  Okay, so, and exactly, we have to keep repeating these things, you know, you've got to repeat them until you gain some mind share.
[00:10:55.606 --> 00:11:12.518]  So, Andy Card, he whispers in George Bush's ear, now we're told, by everybody concerned, we're told by George Bush, by Andy Card, by the official White House transcript and everything, that what Andy Card said to George Bush was something to this effect, that a second tower has been hit, America is under attack.
[00:11:13.319 --> 00:11:22.669]  Now, what person, whether he's a president or whether he's a dog catcher, is just going to listen to that and then say nothing and do nothing?
[00:11:22.669 --> 00:11:27.515]  Like, and another interesting thing about this too is this, Andy Card, his trusted advisor,
[00:11:27.875 --> 00:11:30.836]  He doesn't wait for some kind of a response.
[00:11:30.836 --> 00:11:33.497]  He doesn't say, do you want to do something, Mr. President?
[00:11:33.497 --> 00:11:35.357]  Or should we go, Mr. President?
[00:11:35.357 --> 00:11:38.118]  Or do you have anything to say about that, Mr. President?
[00:11:38.118 --> 00:11:39.599]  Will we see you later, Mr. President?
[00:11:39.599 --> 00:11:40.119]  No.
[00:11:40.119 --> 00:11:42.080]  Andy Carr just backs off and walks away.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.541]  His actions are extremely dubious and they're anomalous in the extreme also.
[00:11:46.541 --> 00:11:48.862]  Well, then George Bush... Well, that was a scheduled stop too.
[00:11:48.862 --> 00:11:51.763]  The Secret Service would not let the President do that.
[00:11:52.143 --> 00:11:59.747]  No, it was known, it was known, publicly known because his itinerary had been announced exactly where the President was.
[00:11:59.747 --> 00:12:07.292]  So if America was really under terrorist attack, then that would mean that the President would be probably the number one potential victim.
[00:12:07.292 --> 00:12:09.973]  Now here's the problem with talking about 9-1-1.
[00:12:09.973 --> 00:12:15.036]  What we're talking about is 1% of the total red flag smoking gun evidence
[00:12:16.098 --> 00:12:21.301]  I want people to understand that, because you can hear what we're saying, try to argue with it, try to... This is a complex issue.
[00:12:21.301 --> 00:12:33.028]  When you start looking at who trained the hijackers, who founded Al-Qaeda, who stood to gain, start looking at the public officials like mayors of San Francisco and Ashcroft and generals being told not to fly to New York that day.
[00:12:33.348 --> 00:12:39.095]  You start adding the insider trading, you start adding hundreds of other smoking gun points, then it's totally clear.
[00:12:39.095 --> 00:12:52.371]  But this is central, what you're talking about, the stand down for an hour and 50 minutes plus, the staged press conference, you know, the staged photo op, where we learn with him, and it's so sick.
[00:12:52.371 --> 00:12:52.712]  Go ahead.
[00:12:53.012 --> 00:13:04.257]  Well, yeah, and in my video called The Great Deception, I just say, I sort of loop that video of the President being informed.
[00:13:04.257 --> 00:13:07.478]  I loop it, you know, it goes back around about six times.
[00:13:07.478 --> 00:13:10.100]  And I say, this guy is play-acting.
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.140]  This is a play.
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.461]  This man is acting, right here, right now.
[00:13:13.461 --> 00:13:13.861]  See?
[00:13:13.861 --> 00:13:15.122]  Look, he's acting.
[00:13:15.122 --> 00:13:17.883]  But later it came out that he was, that he already knew all of it.
[00:13:18.343 --> 00:13:19.924]  Well, yeah.
[00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:30.351]  See, there's the anomaly that when he was speaking to those kids later in some public town hall meeting in Florida, a short while later in Little... What was his name?
[00:13:30.351 --> 00:13:31.312]  I've got it in my video.
[00:13:31.312 --> 00:13:35.295]  Little Jenkins or Jason asked him a question.
[00:13:35.916 --> 00:13:36.416]  I think so.
[00:13:51.578 --> 00:13:52.558]  Absolutely ludicrous.
[00:13:52.558 --> 00:13:54.579]  No one saw the first plane hit.
[00:13:54.579 --> 00:13:57.560]  There were no videos of that until days later.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.301]  Exactly.
[00:13:59.301 --> 00:14:03.983]  I was working on this series of six commentaries about this, which I started on.
[00:14:03.983 --> 00:14:07.384]  I finally got my nerve up enough to start this in January 2002.
[00:14:07.384 --> 00:14:08.004]  My first one appeared on
[00:14:11.005 --> 00:14:20.230]  On January the 14th, was aired January 14th on National Canadian Television, and I thought that I was really, really late in raising this.
[00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.611]  I was feeling really bad in my own conscience.
[00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:26.073]  Yeah, I'm not bragging, but I had a film out one month after.
[00:14:26.073 --> 00:14:27.173]  Well, bless you.
[00:14:27.173 --> 00:14:28.894]  I mean, you are on top.
[00:14:28.894 --> 00:14:35.257]  And I'll say in my defense that I knew the day it happened, I knew the day it happened that it was what we've
[00:14:37.698 --> 00:14:51.821]  It's interesting when you ask people as I do in connections writing my book, I ask them, when did you twig that this was fishy and why?
[00:14:51.821 --> 00:14:58.403]  You get all these different answers and you of course well know and you've probably had him on your program, Michel Chossudovsky.
[00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:00.766]  You know him, the University of Iowa?
[00:15:00.766 --> 00:15:01.786]  Yes, we've had him on.
[00:15:01.786 --> 00:15:04.047]  He's put some of my articles in his magazine.
[00:15:04.047 --> 00:15:04.807]  Exactly.
[00:15:04.807 --> 00:15:06.888]  So, he's well known to you.
[00:15:06.888 --> 00:15:07.949]  Tremendous researcher.
[00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:09.429]  Tremendous person.
[00:15:09.429 --> 00:15:13.231]  And so, I asked him personally, I said, when did you twig?
[00:15:13.231 --> 00:15:19.874]  And he said while he was driving from his home, which is about, I think it's an hour and a half drive from his university office,
[00:15:20.454 --> 00:15:25.156]  And just before he left home, someone said, something's going on, and so he's listening to the car radio.
[00:15:25.156 --> 00:15:30.277]  And by the time he arrived, an hour and a half later, arrived at his office, the U.S.
[00:15:30.277 --> 00:15:35.479]  government was already naming Osama bin Laden as the key perpetrator.
[00:15:35.479 --> 00:15:36.619]  And that did it for him.
[00:15:36.619 --> 00:15:38.059]  He said, that's no way!
[00:15:38.059 --> 00:15:40.900]  An hour and a half after this happened that you know who does it!
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.001]  Al-Bazai's found a passport in the rubble, uncharged.
[00:15:44.001 --> 00:15:46.302]  Just fluttered down from heaven, man up from heaven, eh?
[00:15:47.333 --> 00:15:55.939]  Now, Alex, there's something you mentioned, and I'd like to follow up on it with you if you'd like.
[00:15:55.939 --> 00:15:59.141]  I think it's really, really important, because you got talking about deeper background.
[00:15:59.141 --> 00:16:02.023]  For instance, you said, who trained Al-Qaeda?
[00:16:02.023 --> 00:16:05.725]  Now, this is very important, and I find that this is an obstacle for some people.
[00:16:05.725 --> 00:16:12.610]  You see, they still really believe that there are terrorists who are just, oh, crazy people or they're
[00:16:13.536 --> 00:16:29.190]  Arabs especially, or Muslim fanatics, or they could be any kind of race, color, creed, or whatever, but they're these individual homegrown fanatics who are just really angry and twisted and so forth, and then they throw bombs or they do whatever.
[00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:33.774]  Now, of course, down through history there have been many such people, no question.
[00:16:33.774 --> 00:16:39.800]  And I think one reason that people can believe this version of terrorism, because I want to come to the second version of terrorism in a minute,
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:53.704]  The reason that people can identify with and believe in that kind of terrorist, your retail terrorist, is because a lot of us, ordinary human beings, we've been so damn angry different times about something that we ourselves have thought... Hey, watch.
[00:16:53.704 --> 00:16:54.164]  Stay there.
[00:16:54.164 --> 00:16:55.765]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:55.765 --> 00:16:56.585]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:59.192 --> 00:17:05.996]  Thanks for listening to the M2K Talk Archives, and we are listener-supported with the honors system.
[00:17:05.996 --> 00:17:07.637]  We ask that you wait.
[00:17:07.637 --> 00:17:09.539]  Don't donate a dollar at a time.
[00:17:09.539 --> 00:17:15.122]  PayPal charges a 35-cent surcharge on anything of a dollar or less.
[00:17:15.122 --> 00:17:18.624]  Wait till you listen to five or ten, and then donate, please.
[00:17:18.624 --> 00:17:20.846]  We appreciate your voluntary support.
[00:17:25.868 --> 00:17:29.053]  Alright, we got Barry Zwicker on with us.
[00:17:29.053 --> 00:17:32.217]  He's written for all the big papers, award winning, on and on and on.
[00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:34.880]  Globe and Mail, Toronto Star.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.802]  He's the media critic.
[00:17:35.802 --> 00:17:37.204]  He studies the media.
[00:17:37.204 --> 00:17:38.625]  He's a TV guy.
[00:17:38.625 --> 00:17:39.547]  He knows what's phony.
[00:17:40.991 --> 00:17:45.256]  More people are telling the truth, and as he said, he's seen the Guerrilla News Network.
[00:17:45.256 --> 00:17:46.377]  Great video they put out.
[00:17:46.377 --> 00:17:48.760]  It's good for the general public, 30 minutes long.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.763]  Fortunately, my films are, many of them, almost three hours.
[00:17:51.763 --> 00:17:54.906]  So much evidence, I want to put it all in, but I can't even hit the tip of the iceberg.
[00:17:54.906 --> 00:17:59.932]  This is such a sloppily done thing they carried out, other than the remote controlling.
[00:17:59.932 --> 00:18:02.334]  But continuing,
[00:18:03.826 --> 00:18:08.627]  I've done a study of modern terrorism, and in every case, it's intelligence agencies.
[00:18:08.627 --> 00:18:13.248]  And sometimes they use useful idiots, but generally they just do it themselves and grab some Patsy.
[00:18:13.248 --> 00:18:19.189]  And you were telling a story, Mary, but also you mentioned the Northwoods document where the U.S.
[00:18:19.189 --> 00:18:23.110]  government calls for hijacking jet airliners, bombing D.C.
[00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:25.431]  ABC News, Baltimore Sun first reported it before 9-1-1.
[00:18:26.784 --> 00:18:28.905]  When you have stuff like this, people say, well, how?
[00:18:28.905 --> 00:18:29.326]  Why?
[00:18:29.326 --> 00:18:30.226]  Why would they do it?
[00:18:30.226 --> 00:18:35.649]  They tell us in the Northwest Document how they're going to kill people, how they're going to frame passes.
[00:18:35.649 --> 00:18:37.650]  This is an amazing document, isn't it?
[00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.712]  It certainly is, and I did use that in my video, too.
[00:18:40.712 --> 00:18:43.334]  I read James Bamford's Body of Secrets.
[00:18:43.334 --> 00:18:46.896]  There are other sources for that information, too, but he has some good stuff.
[00:18:46.896 --> 00:18:50.218]  And I'll tell you one thing... Well, the National Security Archives has the public document.
[00:18:50.658 --> 00:18:53.199]  Yeah, I've seen a photocopy of it.
[00:18:53.199 --> 00:19:00.603]  And General Lyman Lemnitzer was the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in those days, and that guy was so right-wing that he was really...
[00:19:01.658 --> 00:19:06.160]  You really have to wonder about... Well, it's not even right-wing.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.901]  It's command and control.
[00:19:08.901 --> 00:19:09.801]  Yeah, you're right.
[00:19:09.801 --> 00:19:11.202]  It's a lot about command and control.
[00:19:11.202 --> 00:19:14.583]  You were trying to talk about the other forms of terror, too.
[00:19:14.583 --> 00:19:16.104]  Yeah, the other forms of terror, too.
[00:19:16.104 --> 00:19:25.387]  But one thing about Operation Northwood just might be mentioned parenthetically here that really shocks people when I have some... You know how we do in our videos.
[00:19:25.387 --> 00:19:29.489]  We've got that B-roll so we can show a few things to back up text.
[00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:45.630]  And with Operation Northwood, some people think that it was just one plan to have some Americans, actually Americans killed, just like a replay of The Mean, so that this would antagonize the American public and mobilize them for a war on Cuba.
[00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:46.452]  That was going to be the
[00:19:46.872 --> 00:19:48.274]  That was the aim of it.
[00:19:48.274 --> 00:19:51.478]  The quote on page four is, casually listed in U.S.
[00:19:51.478 --> 00:19:54.281]  newspapers will cause a helpful wave of indignation.
[00:19:54.281 --> 00:19:55.563]  A helpful wave of indignation.
[00:19:55.563 --> 00:20:02.391]  You've got the exact quote there, and that's the exact quote that I quoted, but you'll remember in the book something that some other people haven't mentioned.
[00:20:02.891 --> 00:20:13.700]  They had alternative scenarios they were going to use, and at that time, John Glenn was about to go up for his first liftoff into space, which was successful, of course.
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:25.029]  And they had a plan, it was all ready to go, that if something had gone wrong with John Glenn's capsule, and if it had burned, crashed, or anything, they were ready.
[00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:31.415]  They already had manufactured fake parts to prove, quote-unquote, that Cubans
[00:20:31.935 --> 00:20:32.155]  Thank you.
[00:20:47.797 --> 00:21:00.511]  And even in the case of Vietnam, you know, it was the alleged, but totally fake, non-existent North Vietnamese PT boats that allegedly attacked the Maddox and the Turner Joy.
[00:21:00.511 --> 00:21:08.480]  But they've already been doing a lot of stuff to antagonize and spur some kind of trouble for several months before that.
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.821]  But this was the one that, finally, you know what?
[00:21:11.821 --> 00:21:14.722]  The North Vietnamese were too smart and they wouldn't bite.
[00:21:14.722 --> 00:21:17.884]  And so they finally had to just make it up out of whole cloth.
[00:21:17.884 --> 00:21:19.844]  And that's a similar case with Cuba.
[00:21:19.844 --> 00:21:26.007]  You know, many times there have been low-level flights, very provocative, roaring right over mainland Cuba.
[00:21:26.007 --> 00:21:28.228]  And the Cubans are told, do not shoot at them.
[00:21:29.148 --> 00:21:34.310]  Let them go, because if you shoot at them, you're going to have a ton of trouble.
[00:21:44.213 --> 00:21:47.378]  Now, you were trying to talk about, and I want to try to hold you over and take some calls if you can.
[00:21:47.378 --> 00:21:48.500]  We've got a break here in a second.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.303]  We're trying to talk about the second type of terror.
[00:21:50.303 --> 00:21:54.669]  Modern big industrial terror, complex terror, can only be carried out by states.
[00:21:54.669 --> 00:21:58.896]  That's what the top generals and people said in this press conference in Portugal last year.
[00:21:59.256 --> 00:22:00.477]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:22:00.477 --> 00:22:04.079]  And it's very, very important that this be said repeatedly on air.
[00:22:04.079 --> 00:22:08.821]  Because it's wholesale terrorism, it's state terrorism, there's whole books on this.
[00:22:08.821 --> 00:22:15.485]  This is the primary form of terrorism is that people are found, as you say, Patsy's, people who are strange in some way, they're trained.
[00:22:15.485 --> 00:22:24.570]  This was the CIA's operation in Afghanistan with Saudi oil billions and the CIA, which was the largest CIA operation up until that time at least,
[00:22:25.459 --> 00:22:43.473]  Was to find, uh, was to build up this little obscure sect, Al-Qaeda, and to get these kids into these madrasas in Pakistan, and just, Bill, you saw them, they were just, they were just, uh, sort of... Washington Post reported that our government shipped over a million radical hadiths that said, kill Americans.
[00:22:43.473 --> 00:22:46.535]  Our government's shipping them stuff of how to be vicious.
[00:22:48.715 --> 00:22:49.175]  Incredible.
[00:22:49.175 --> 00:22:49.696]  Stay right there.
[00:22:49.696 --> 00:22:50.356]  We've got a break again.
[00:22:50.356 --> 00:22:51.057]  I want you to come back.
[00:22:51.057 --> 00:22:52.538]  Hit any points you want to get to.
[00:22:52.538 --> 00:22:53.358]  Plug your video.
[00:22:53.358 --> 00:22:53.958]  It's amazing.
[00:22:53.958 --> 00:22:54.799]  You're booked.
[00:22:54.799 --> 00:22:55.940]  And then we're going to go to some calls.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.421]  Don in Illinois and others that are holding.
[00:22:57.421 --> 00:22:59.142]  You want to talk to Barry Schweiker?
[00:22:59.142 --> 00:22:59.782]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:22:59.782 --> 00:22:59.922]  800-259-9231.
[00:22:59.922 --> 00:23:00.663]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:23:00.663 --> 00:23:01.143]  Infowars.com.
[00:23:01.143 --> 00:23:02.384]  We're on the march.
[00:23:02.384 --> 00:23:03.705]  The empire's on the run.
[00:23:03.705 --> 00:23:06.226]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:23:19.737 --> 00:23:24.802]  Black Birkin.
[00:23:24.802 --> 00:23:27.185]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:23:27.185 --> 00:23:34.032]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:23:34.032 --> 00:23:35.954]  Barry Weikers, our guest.
[00:23:35.954 --> 00:23:39.598]  Headline, Conspiracy Crusader, doubts official 9-1-1 version.
[00:23:39.598 --> 00:23:40.920]  Writing a book, got a film.
[00:23:42.398 --> 00:23:45.800]  Exposing this, and he came right out with it, is they didn't have knowledge, folks.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.560]  They were complicit inside job.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:55.644]  We've got Dan in Illinois, John Boston, Warren, Colorado, John, Canada, and others as we blast out on the AM and FM dial.
[00:23:56.582 --> 00:24:00.303]  In D.C., Boston, Denver, Austin, all over the place, the show's exploding.
[00:24:00.303 --> 00:24:01.683]  People want the truth.
[00:24:01.683 --> 00:24:04.644]  We wake up the right wing and the left wing to the tyranny.
[00:24:04.644 --> 00:24:07.404]  I started out, of course, as what you'd call a mainstream conservative.
[00:24:07.404 --> 00:24:14.766]  I am a pro-liberty individual, and I found out the truth that the entire government is rotten to the core across the political spectrum.
[00:24:14.766 --> 00:24:23.608]  We've got a real life to hire to change that, and we're about to go to your calls, but I've been jumping all over our guests because he's got so many insights, and we're on the same page.
[00:24:24.655 --> 00:24:28.099]  Barry, any other key points you want to hit on before we go to these callers?
[00:24:28.099 --> 00:24:35.686]  Well, look, I'd like to, I'd just like to really, really enter a vote of confidence for what you just said about yourself.
[00:24:35.686 --> 00:24:36.827]  About right-wing and left-wing.
[00:24:36.827 --> 00:24:38.489]  Earlier I used the term right-wing and...
[00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:51.601]  I don't take it back, but also I believe it's even larger that the right wing and the left wing, we go beyond left and right in this, because liberty is something that everybody should want.
[00:24:51.601 --> 00:24:55.625]  Well, it's a military-industrial complex, and they'll use any party at any time.
[00:24:55.625 --> 00:25:04.173]  That's right, and one thing I like to see, actually there was some terrorism legislation introduced back in the Clinton era, and even earlier in the Reagan era, which didn't
[00:25:06.214 --> 00:25:07.214]  Well, it didn't pass.
[00:25:07.214 --> 00:25:10.115]  It was Patriot Act stuff, but it didn't get quite squeezed through.
[00:25:10.115 --> 00:25:15.156]  There was the infamous alleged Libyan hit squad who was trying to frighten the public into that.
[00:25:15.156 --> 00:25:24.077]  And the reason that legislation didn't go through was because of this beautiful, unlikely pairing of the ACLU and the NRA.
[00:25:24.077 --> 00:25:24.797]  I loved it!
[00:25:24.797 --> 00:25:25.238]  You know?
[00:25:25.238 --> 00:25:28.358]  Both sides came in and said, this is bad legislation.
[00:25:28.358 --> 00:25:29.838]  So I want to back up any bit.
[00:25:29.838 --> 00:25:32.959]  The second thing I want to say before we take these calls, if I may,
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:42.011]  I was talking about the nature of belief and saying that denial is the surface and what's underneath denial is fears and I think it's really, really important.
[00:25:42.011 --> 00:25:44.795]  This has changed my life and heart a little bit.
[00:25:44.795 --> 00:25:49.182]  My coming to understand more about this as this book writes me is that
[00:25:49.642 --> 00:25:51.563]  People have legitimate fears, Alex.
[00:25:51.563 --> 00:25:52.924]  They have legitimate fears.
[00:25:52.924 --> 00:26:08.313]  When they're confronted with such an incredible, dark suggestions that maybe their top leaders would not only lie to them, they would kill their own citizens for private gain and for all sorts of shadowy purposes that have to do with bloated militarism and everything.
[00:26:08.313 --> 00:26:12.676]  And so, if people speak up about that, they will have what I say are legitimate fears.
[00:26:12.676 --> 00:26:19.200]  They may fear that people will shun or avoid them if they speak up and they'll be called non-patriotic.
[00:26:19.955 --> 00:26:24.558]  Maybe they'll face peer group pressure, which is a very powerful thing to be laughed at.
[00:26:24.558 --> 00:26:26.099]  Maybe they won't get a promotion.
[00:26:26.099 --> 00:26:28.321]  Maybe their very job might be in danger.
[00:26:28.321 --> 00:26:29.822]  And these fears are legitimate.
[00:26:29.822 --> 00:26:31.943]  And I have sympathy for people who have those fears.
[00:26:31.943 --> 00:26:32.723]  I'm lucky.
[00:26:32.723 --> 00:26:33.524]  I'm independent.
[00:26:33.524 --> 00:26:35.725]  Since 1970, I've been self-employed.
[00:26:35.725 --> 00:26:36.586]  Nobody could fire me.
[00:26:36.926 --> 00:26:38.507]  Well, that's luxury.
[00:26:38.507 --> 00:26:40.187]  A lot of people can be fired.
[00:26:40.187 --> 00:26:42.928]  A lot of people's neighbors will shun and avoid them.
[00:26:42.928 --> 00:26:49.671]  And I've got a lot of sympathy, but at the same time, I don't have so much sympathy that I let people off the hook that they've got to do some homework.
[00:26:49.671 --> 00:26:51.111]  They're totally enslaving us.
[00:26:51.111 --> 00:26:52.532]  They're going to go after everybody.
[00:26:52.532 --> 00:26:54.993]  We must fight this, even in the short term it's coming down.
[00:26:54.993 --> 00:26:56.293]  And let me say something.
[00:26:56.293 --> 00:26:57.234]  This is an illusion.
[00:26:57.234 --> 00:27:01.155]  When they attack the Dixie Chicks and all that, that is to create a chilling effect.
[00:27:01.155 --> 00:27:03.976]  That is to destroy the First Amendment, what America's about.
[00:27:03.976 --> 00:27:05.397]  And I've got to tell you something, Barry.
[00:27:05.897 --> 00:27:13.321]  I've done, this is why I say this every week, it's an incredible testament, I've done over 800 radio interviews since 9-1-1.
[00:27:13.321 --> 00:27:26.288]  And because I'm bold, I don't apologize, I'm not afraid, that spirit telegraphs, and I've had a hundred callers, maybe a hundred that disagree, thousands and thousands and thousands that agree.
[00:27:26.288 --> 00:27:30.190]  I'll be on some show that covers 35 states, a conservative show, a liberal show.
[00:27:31.571 --> 00:27:34.473]  One caller out of 30 might call and disagree.
[00:27:34.473 --> 00:27:36.314]  They're an incoherent idiot.
[00:27:36.314 --> 00:27:39.216]  They'll generally say I should be arrested for what I'm saying.
[00:27:39.216 --> 00:27:40.977]  So we are the majority.
[00:27:40.977 --> 00:27:45.699]  I don't believe their illusion, and that's why we're able to do this and say this, because there's so many of us.
[00:27:45.699 --> 00:27:48.781]  If it was one or two of us doing this, we'd die in car wrecks real quick.
[00:27:48.781 --> 00:27:51.223]  There's so many of us now telling the truth.
[00:27:51.223 --> 00:27:52.063]  I couldn't agree more.
[00:27:52.063 --> 00:27:59.748]  And you know, when I did my original series of commentaries about this back in January of last year,
[00:28:01.169 --> 00:28:08.032]  Some people at our TV channel, my senior producer said she felt sick to her stomach the first morning she came in.
[00:28:08.032 --> 00:28:10.914]  She was sure that there was going to be all these horrible emails and everything.
[00:28:10.914 --> 00:28:15.457]  And she opened up her emails and the first one said, congratulations, you guys have got courage.
[00:28:15.457 --> 00:28:16.237]  Terrific.
[00:28:16.237 --> 00:28:19.639]  And she said, well, we've got at least one good email.
[00:28:19.639 --> 00:28:20.860]  And then the second one was the same.
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:22.781]  I had over a thousand emails.
[00:28:22.781 --> 00:28:23.721]  And you know what?
[00:28:23.721 --> 00:28:26.723]  The antagonistic ones, I could count on the fingers of two hands.
[00:28:27.063 --> 00:28:33.588]  I had the same experience you do, and that's the experience Michelle Landsberg had with her column of last Sunday.
[00:28:33.588 --> 00:28:42.414]  Barry, people that don't agree with us, that don't have an internal understanding, a historical understanding, don't know how to send emails.
[00:28:43.118 --> 00:28:44.118]  Okay.
[00:28:44.118 --> 00:28:47.499]  I mean, anybody who loves their children will instinctively know what's happening.
[00:28:47.499 --> 00:28:49.500]  Then you look at the rational evidence.
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.121]  It is disgusting.
[00:28:51.121 --> 00:29:00.824]  It's like learning your neighbor you thought was nice was a serial killer, and as they remove the dead, desiccated bodies out of the backyard, you go, you vomit, but at least you know the truth.
[00:29:00.824 --> 00:29:01.384]  Yep.
[00:29:01.384 --> 00:29:02.324]  Now, let's take calls.
[00:29:02.324 --> 00:29:04.065]  Let's talk to Don in Illinois.
[00:29:04.065 --> 00:29:05.285]  Don, you're on the air with our guests.
[00:29:05.285 --> 00:29:07.346]  Go ahead.
[00:29:07.346 --> 00:29:07.946]  Welcome, Don.
[00:29:07.946 --> 00:29:08.506]  You're on the air.
[00:29:09.841 --> 00:29:10.641]  Or Dan.
[00:29:10.641 --> 00:29:11.522]  Just go ahead, caller.
[00:29:11.522 --> 00:29:12.282]  You're on the air.
[00:29:12.282 --> 00:29:13.443]  Okay.
[00:29:13.443 --> 00:29:14.063]  You're on the air.
[00:29:14.063 --> 00:29:14.483]  Go ahead.
[00:29:14.483 --> 00:29:15.143]  Hello.
[00:29:15.143 --> 00:29:15.844]  Yes, hello.
[00:29:15.844 --> 00:29:16.984]  Hi, Dan.
[00:29:16.984 --> 00:29:19.105]  Bruce, you were talking about denial.
[00:29:19.105 --> 00:29:31.390]  And you're hitting it right on the head, because isn't it the degree of denial that somebody's own life, whether they're dealing with their own problems or not, like bad marriage, bad job, and they're just staying in it.
[00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:33.631]  And in order to do that, they have to be in denial.
[00:29:33.631 --> 00:29:35.972]  We're denying napkin gas, destroying our economy.
[00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:36.930]  Right.
[00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:45.681]  I mean, the economy going down, all these particular things, in order to survive, you have to shut down and not pay attention to all the details.
[00:29:45.681 --> 00:29:56.353]  When that happens, you can't perceive the other parts of the world being so terrible either, because if you can't perceive it in your own life, you're not going to be able to perceive it at a higher level.
[00:29:57.647 --> 00:29:59.168]  I agree with you, Dan.
[00:29:59.168 --> 00:30:01.629]  I think you're right.
[00:30:01.629 --> 00:30:03.851]  But you know, we don't have to go into denial.
[00:30:03.851 --> 00:30:05.651]  I don't think you meant we have to.
[00:30:05.651 --> 00:30:07.753]  The thing is that denial does work.
[00:30:07.753 --> 00:30:12.015]  There are things that have happened in our family that are very painful to think about.
[00:30:12.675 --> 00:30:16.336]  And you don't want to think about them every day, so let's call it denial.
[00:30:16.336 --> 00:30:22.758]  Okay, but it's a sort of a conscious denial where you just say, I'm not going to wallow in the pain of something that happened.
[00:30:22.758 --> 00:30:30.820]  Have you ever been driving along and a bad thought from childhood or something or something embarrassing comes back into your mind and you catch yourself going, ah!
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.821]  And you're like, wow, that was a subconscious thing that just came out.
[00:30:34.861 --> 00:30:38.283]  Yeah, and so actually we're wired for denial.
[00:30:38.283 --> 00:30:40.045]  Defense mechanisms, they call them.
[00:30:40.045 --> 00:30:41.505]  Yeah, defense mechanisms.
[00:30:41.505 --> 00:30:42.426]  Which mechanism?
[00:30:42.426 --> 00:30:43.447]  Defense mechanisms.
[00:30:43.447 --> 00:30:44.347]  Yeah, defense mechanism.
[00:30:44.347 --> 00:30:46.168]  That's very, very well said, Dan.
[00:30:46.168 --> 00:30:51.311]  But anyway, the thing is that we have to, it's very important that we not lie to ourselves.
[00:30:51.311 --> 00:30:53.253]  That's the key thing.
[00:30:53.253 --> 00:31:03.659]  I happen, my hero happens to be a guy named Bertrand Russell, a dead British white philosopher, and he had his own ten commandments, and his first commandment is never lie to yourself.
[00:31:04.589 --> 00:31:07.471]  And I think that is the first and foremost commandment.
[00:31:07.471 --> 00:31:08.291]  Don't lie to yourself.
[00:31:08.291 --> 00:31:13.033]  Bertrand Russell, you've got this left-wing globalism arm, and that's how they catch us all.
[00:31:13.033 --> 00:31:16.075]  They've got the phony right-wing, they've got the phony left-wing, but that's for another discussion.
[00:31:16.075 --> 00:31:18.656]  But that is another discussion!
[00:31:18.656 --> 00:31:31.302]  One more thing, Perry, I was mentioning to Alex the other day, is that when you're not having the ability to think and it increases prejudice at the same time, is that you can confuse two different races or people within the same race.
[00:31:32.054 --> 00:31:34.295]  The Al Qaeda is a trained soldier.
[00:31:34.295 --> 00:31:37.275]  He's not a suicide bomber like a Palestinian.
[00:31:37.275 --> 00:31:52.919]  And they're trying to pawn off on the public that there's no difference between an Al Qaeda, James Bond, trained person who's trained to live, not to die, is equivalent to this desperate Palestinian that only has one way of doing things, is blowing himself up.
[00:31:52.919 --> 00:31:53.699]  He doesn't operate that way.
[00:31:53.699 --> 00:31:54.099]  Absolutely.
[00:31:54.099 --> 00:31:55.079]  Dan, thanks for the call.
[00:31:55.079 --> 00:31:56.820]  John in Boston, Mass.
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.000]  You're on the air with our guest.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:58.600]  Go ahead, John.
[00:32:00.891 --> 00:32:02.915]  Hi, John.
[00:32:02.915 --> 00:32:05.580]  John has the radio on.
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:06.822]  He's not listening right now.
[00:32:06.822 --> 00:32:09.527]  The callers have kind of been doing this to me lately.
[00:32:09.527 --> 00:32:10.229]  John, are you there?
[00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.131]  Okay, but put him on hold.
[00:32:13.131 --> 00:32:14.111]  He'll be back later.
[00:32:14.111 --> 00:32:16.452]  Let's hope they're so interested they can't hear themselves.
[00:32:16.452 --> 00:32:17.793]  Well, you can hear the delay.
[00:32:17.793 --> 00:32:18.873]  He sees off, doesn't know.
[00:32:18.873 --> 00:32:19.954]  He'll find out soon.
[00:32:19.954 --> 00:32:24.896]  Warren in Colorado, then we'll go to John at Canada Bill in Alaska.
[00:32:24.896 --> 00:32:25.876]  Warren, you're on the air.
[00:32:25.876 --> 00:32:26.536]  Welcome.
[00:32:26.536 --> 00:32:27.617]  Hello.
[00:32:27.617 --> 00:32:39.042]  Real quick, I remember on September 11th that morning, they were showing pictures of a terrorist on TV, and I thought that was so strange how they could know that already.
[00:32:39.901 --> 00:32:42.382]  So quickly.
[00:32:42.382 --> 00:32:47.245]  Actually, I can barely hear you guys, but I'll just continue.
[00:32:47.245 --> 00:32:58.191]  I expected a lot more security measures in place other than shutting down the airports, and I guess I'm... Well, that was just training us to accept the military on the streets.
[00:32:58.191 --> 00:33:06.416]  Yeah, I'd like to know your thoughts on, you know, my thoughts were that, you know, the borders be shut down and all this interstate
[00:33:08.948 --> 00:33:14.792]  Interstate patrolman would be out and shutting down borders and so on, if that was actually the truth.
[00:33:14.792 --> 00:33:15.433]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:33:15.433 --> 00:33:18.615]  Our borders, north and south, are more open than ever.
[00:33:18.615 --> 00:33:22.878]  They check you more going into Canada than coming out of Canada to the U.S.
[00:33:22.878 --> 00:33:32.645]  This is a key thing for people that is waking them up, Mary, is that our southern border is more open than ever, and they're telling us that the Pentagon's going to have to watch you to keep you safe.
[00:33:32.645 --> 00:33:33.646]  It isn't holding water.
[00:33:33.646 --> 00:33:36.088]  That's one of the big kinks in the propaganda.
[00:33:36.935 --> 00:33:38.036]  It certainly is.
[00:33:38.036 --> 00:33:42.799]  I mean, there's such a horrible track record of crushing civil liberties here.
[00:33:42.799 --> 00:33:51.005]  And that's a great hope that I have for the American public, the man and woman on the street, that somehow they'll connect two dots.
[00:33:51.005 --> 00:33:54.228]  One dot is the proud history of liberty.
[00:33:56.529 --> 00:34:00.493]  And of protecting liberty at any price.
[00:34:00.493 --> 00:34:04.976]  And what's happening with the new Patriot Act 1 and Patriot Act 2?
[00:34:04.976 --> 00:34:07.118]  They just don't mix its oil and water.
[00:34:07.118 --> 00:34:14.224]  Well, I mean, Patriot Act 2 is secret arrest for any crime, secret execution, says it in the subsections.
[00:34:14.224 --> 00:34:18.287]  And they're saying we've got to take America's rights away to defend America.
[00:34:18.287 --> 00:34:25.133]  America's America because we have this Bill of Rights and Constitution, not because we're a police state with police in black ski masks.
[00:34:26.144 --> 00:34:38.830]  You know, this is the time for Americans to wake up to ask themselves the question, are they for the kind of liberty that they've been raised on and told about and taught?
[00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:44.072]  Or are they going to accept some cockamamie stories by the current gang?
[00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:49.732]  That obviously is interested in crushing these liberties.
[00:34:49.732 --> 00:34:56.916]  I mean, I'm just boggled how Americans have allowed themselves to let this happen.
[00:34:56.916 --> 00:35:05.280]  Well, our news media just dribbles it out and then makes the petty stories big, but I was at a Cleaners a few months ago and a state police major was already in there getting his clothes
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:10.742]  And he was an older guy, and he said, Alex, we were brought up that what's happening in America is what happened in Soviet Union.
[00:35:10.742 --> 00:35:11.682]  We know this is wrong.
[00:35:11.682 --> 00:35:12.602]  And I said, how many of you know it?
[00:35:12.602 --> 00:35:14.603]  And he goes, most of the old guys.
[00:35:14.603 --> 00:35:15.884]  We know what's happening is bad.
[00:35:15.884 --> 00:35:18.965]  We know 9-1-1 couldn't be pulled off by those people.
[00:35:18.965 --> 00:35:21.866]  And the guy almost had tears in his eyes.
[00:35:21.866 --> 00:35:23.746]  So people are waking up.
[00:35:23.746 --> 00:35:25.747]  He's got to get more than tears in his eyes, you know.
[00:35:25.747 --> 00:35:26.968]  He's got to speak up.
[00:35:26.968 --> 00:35:30.989]  He's got to go that extra step to become an active citizen.
[00:35:31.793 --> 00:35:32.453]  Absolutely.
[00:35:32.453 --> 00:35:34.014]  Let's talk to John in Boston.
[00:35:34.014 --> 00:35:34.494]  He's there.
[00:35:34.494 --> 00:35:37.835]  Then we'll go to John in Canada and Bill in Alaska and others.
[00:35:37.835 --> 00:35:39.075]  Go ahead, John in Boston.
[00:35:39.075 --> 00:35:40.055]  You're on.
[00:35:40.055 --> 00:35:41.016]  Yeah, sorry about that.
[00:35:41.016 --> 00:35:42.236]  I was listening on the internet.
[00:35:42.236 --> 00:35:42.956]  That's okay, sir.
[00:35:42.956 --> 00:35:43.356]  Go ahead.
[00:35:43.356 --> 00:35:46.057]  I didn't realize it was delayed.
[00:35:46.057 --> 00:35:47.958]  I'm a first-time caller, by the way.
[00:35:47.958 --> 00:35:50.198]  I've been listening to you since, like, right after 9-11.
[00:35:50.198 --> 00:35:51.499]  I love the show.
[00:35:51.499 --> 00:35:52.039]  Great show.
[00:35:52.039 --> 00:35:54.480]  Great guest.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.180]  I just wanted to, Alex, I wanted to bring your attention.
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.161]  In today's Boston Herald on page 4,
[00:36:00.427 --> 00:36:06.033]  There's a piece about John Kerry and his Skull and Bones connection.
[00:36:06.033 --> 00:36:17.827]  Yeah, we're going to have two Skull and Bones guys running against each other in a secret, blue-blood society, a racist society, where they admittedly have Nazi flags.
[00:36:17.827 --> 00:36:19.228]  That's MSNBC.
[00:36:19.228 --> 00:36:20.389]  Any comments to that, Barry?
[00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:27.635]  Well, you know, I only heard about the Skull and Bones Society about a year ago, and we all have the limits to our belief.
[00:36:27.635 --> 00:36:29.176]  We all have boundaries.
[00:36:29.176 --> 00:36:30.857]  I'm not immune from that either.
[00:36:30.857 --> 00:36:35.941]  I believe the story about Flight 800, that it was mechanical failure.
[00:36:35.941 --> 00:36:40.224]  I can be fooled, too, and I thought, Skull and Bones, that sounds too rich, you know?
[00:36:40.224 --> 00:36:42.806]  I gotta learn more about this.
[00:36:42.806 --> 00:36:44.467]  Well, the friend of mine who told me about this,
[00:36:44.847 --> 00:36:49.311]  He gave me information about it, and my gosh, I found out that it's actually true!
[00:36:49.311 --> 00:36:54.096]  Oh, USA Today says, oh, they do some satanic rituals, that's what's the big deal.
[00:36:54.096 --> 00:36:54.696]  Yep.
[00:36:54.696 --> 00:37:02.504]  And that's what I mean, this is so bizarro, off the scale, how do you even, again, it's the denial, it's like they're trying to shock us.
[00:37:02.504 --> 00:37:02.644]  Yep.
[00:37:03.729 --> 00:37:09.677]  Yep, and the big lie, there can be the big lie technique invoked in these things.
[00:37:09.677 --> 00:37:18.108]  Hitler, you know Goebbels, which Hitler's propaganda minister was a specialist in this, and if you tell, the bigger the lie you tell the more likely people will believe it.
[00:37:18.108 --> 00:37:20.011]  And the reason for that is most people are decent.
[00:37:20.011 --> 00:37:21.353]  Most people, most
[00:37:22.213 --> 00:37:25.154]  Most of the time in their own lives are, in fact, honest.
[00:37:25.154 --> 00:37:26.215]  Well, we have conscience.
[00:37:26.215 --> 00:37:28.816]  I mean, if I say something rude to my wife, I feel bad about it.
[00:37:28.816 --> 00:37:30.537]  These people don't have conscience, do they?
[00:37:30.537 --> 00:37:30.857]  No.
[00:37:30.857 --> 00:37:34.998]  You know, this friend of mine who told me about the Skull and Bones Society, he's a psychotherapist.
[00:37:34.998 --> 00:37:37.379]  He's a family therapist here in Toronto.
[00:37:37.379 --> 00:37:39.440]  And he told me, he said something very interesting.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:44.322]  He said the higher you go in any organization, the more likely you are to encounter a psychopath.
[00:37:45.428 --> 00:37:48.751]  Because the people at the top have had to step on so many people's necks.
[00:37:48.751 --> 00:37:50.273]  They've had to tell so many lies.
[00:37:50.273 --> 00:37:56.578]  They've had to be so single-minded in their devotion to getting power and control that they lose their humanity.
[00:37:56.578 --> 00:37:57.279]  Well, I say it.
[00:37:57.279 --> 00:38:01.143]  Scum rises to the top because you've got to be totally ruthless.
[00:38:01.143 --> 00:38:02.524]  And it's a synthesis of evil.
[00:38:02.524 --> 00:38:04.065]  Thank you, John.
[00:38:04.065 --> 00:38:05.867]  What did the Boston article say, sir?
[00:38:06.907 --> 00:38:12.890]  Um, yeah, the title of it was Kerry Made His Bones in Secret Club Like Bush by Andrew Meagher.
[00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:16.352]  And of course, making your bones is an allusion to... Right.
[00:38:16.352 --> 00:38:19.674]  Um, I'll give you the first couple paragraphs of short.
[00:38:19.674 --> 00:38:33.501]  Um, Washington, Senator John F. Kerry expounds on many issues in his presidential campaign, but he's completely silent on one topic, his membership in the Skull and Bones, Yale's infamous secret society.
[00:38:33.501 --> 00:38:36.223]  John Kerry has absolutely nothing to say on that subject.
[00:38:36.795 --> 00:38:39.837]  Sorry, said Kerry spokeswoman Kelly Bonanda.
[00:38:39.837 --> 00:38:41.257]  Alright, thanks for the call, John.
[00:38:41.257 --> 00:38:42.418]  Very valuable, John.
[00:38:42.418 --> 00:38:43.178]  Very valuable.
[00:38:43.178 --> 00:38:45.920]  Email that to tips at infowars.com.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:49.342]  John in Canada, here on the air with your fellow Canadian.
[00:38:49.342 --> 00:38:51.883]  Go ahead.
[00:38:51.883 --> 00:38:53.264]  John in Canada, go ahead.
[00:38:54.358 --> 00:38:54.918]  Hello?
[00:38:54.918 --> 00:38:55.698]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:38:55.698 --> 00:38:57.399]  Yes, how are you today, gentlemen?
[00:38:57.399 --> 00:38:58.159]  Fine.
[00:38:58.159 --> 00:38:58.859]  Good.
[00:38:58.859 --> 00:39:02.521]  I'd like to, I guess your reception's bad, but anyway, we'll get through this.
[00:39:02.521 --> 00:39:04.741]  I don't know whether Barry's familiar... Let me just stop you.
[00:39:04.741 --> 00:39:06.302]  Can we boost the audio to the callers?
[00:39:06.302 --> 00:39:06.642]  Go ahead.
[00:39:06.642 --> 00:39:08.242]  Hello?
[00:39:08.242 --> 00:39:09.623]  Yeah, we'll try to boost your audio.
[00:39:09.623 --> 00:39:11.303]  Go ahead.
[00:39:11.303 --> 00:39:20.306]  I don't know whether Barry's familiar with the new bill that's just going through the Parliament now, which is tailored after the Homeland Security bill, which is Bill C-17, which takes away the citizens' rights of Canada.
[00:39:20.948 --> 00:39:21.869]  Well, I am.
[00:39:21.869 --> 00:39:25.254]  And not only that, but we've had a total of three of those bills.
[00:39:25.254 --> 00:39:33.645]  And you probably know Gelati, the famous lawyer, Rocco Gelati, and he pointed out a very interesting thing.
[00:39:33.645 --> 00:39:34.987]  He got those bills very early.
[00:39:34.987 --> 00:39:36.409]  There was C-36 and C-42, now there's C-17.
[00:39:38.351 --> 00:39:45.274]  And he got those bills, he put them together, he read all through them, and he found out that individually the bills are bad enough, yeah.
[00:39:45.274 --> 00:39:54.018]  But when you put them together, you put the definition of terrorism here, in another bill you put what the police can do, in another bill it's what the corrections officer can do.
[00:39:54.018 --> 00:40:00.361]  It's an integration, an interface, just like Patriot Act 1 and 2, with Homeland Security, maximum dictatorship.
[00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:03.163]  Exactly, when you put them together.
[00:40:03.163 --> 00:40:08.527]  And not only that, but our bills in Canada were suspiciously fast coming forward.
[00:40:08.527 --> 00:40:10.769]  They really couldn't have been written just after 9-11.
[00:40:10.769 --> 00:40:11.849]  They were in readiness.
[00:40:11.849 --> 00:40:14.471]  Somebody was writing this stuff earlier.
[00:40:14.471 --> 00:40:16.513]  Because they were down in Washington, I'm sure of that.
[00:40:16.513 --> 00:40:18.254]  Well, I'm afraid that could be.
[00:40:18.254 --> 00:40:20.896]  There was a lot too much integration, I would think.
[00:40:20.896 --> 00:40:26.981]  We're going to have serious problems here if Paul Martin becomes Prime Minister of this country, who's already controlling this country.
[00:40:27.622 --> 00:40:30.229]  We're going to have serious problems like we're going to have with Bush the same way.
[00:40:30.229 --> 00:40:31.492]  Well, sir, it's already on the map.
[00:40:31.492 --> 00:40:34.560]  You're not going to have Canadian sovereignty within five years if this continues.
[00:40:35.211 --> 00:40:39.574]  Well, there's a lot of people up here that will turn around and take their guns out regardless of what the government says here.
[00:40:39.574 --> 00:40:41.255]  Because there are a lot of guns out here.
[00:40:41.255 --> 00:40:43.277]  And it's not only Paul Martin, John.
[00:40:43.277 --> 00:40:45.358]  It's also John Manley.
[00:40:45.358 --> 00:40:48.541]  You know, they're cut from the same cloth.
[00:40:48.541 --> 00:40:51.663]  And I think they're out of tune, really, with most Canadians.
[00:40:51.663 --> 00:40:54.465]  Most Canadians are very favorable and friendly to the USA.
[00:40:54.465 --> 00:40:55.686]  We have a lot of American friends.
[00:40:55.686 --> 00:40:56.846]  We travel to the States.
[00:40:56.846 --> 00:40:57.507]  I love the place.
[00:40:58.147 --> 00:41:06.770]  Uh, but the thing is, the governments get together and they pull off... Oh yeah, when I say America's taking over, I mean the dictatorship is going to take over your stuff.
[00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:07.350]  Exactly.
[00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:08.411]  One more segment with our guest.
[00:41:08.411 --> 00:41:11.592]  We'll talk to Bill in Alaska and tell you about his book and his film.
[00:41:11.592 --> 00:41:15.753]  Final segment with our guest in the third hour is the economy, the second amendment, everything.
[00:41:15.753 --> 00:41:16.433]  It's all coming up.
[00:41:16.433 --> 00:41:17.334]  Final segment with our guest.
[00:41:17.334 --> 00:41:17.654]  Stay with me.
[00:41:29.411 --> 00:41:30.412]  Third hour coming up.
[00:41:30.412 --> 00:41:34.655]  If you're not excited, if you're not upset, something's wrong with you.
[00:41:34.655 --> 00:41:39.638]  And I think that, uh, Mary, our guest, is really hit the nail on the head that it is about denial.
[00:41:39.638 --> 00:41:41.380]  It is about the fear deep inside.
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:44.642]  You better get over that fear and face the threat.
[00:41:44.642 --> 00:41:45.943]  It will not make it go away.
[00:41:45.943 --> 00:41:50.966]  There are monsters in the closet in the real world, and hiding under the cover isn't going to save you.
[00:41:50.966 --> 00:41:52.608]  I produced nine films.
[00:41:52.608 --> 00:41:53.889]  The ninth is now out.
[00:41:53.889 --> 00:41:55.790]  Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[00:41:56.525 --> 00:41:58.987]  You want to know what they're going to set up in this country, what they're already setting up?
[00:41:58.987 --> 00:42:00.268]  You need to get the film.
[00:42:00.268 --> 00:42:02.770]  Go to Infowars.com or Net.
[00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:06.533]  Get Road to Tyranny, about 9-1-1, Part 2 of that, Masters of Terror.
[00:42:06.533 --> 00:42:09.375]  Get my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[00:42:09.375 --> 00:42:12.237]  Go to Infowars.com or Net, or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:42:12.237 --> 00:42:13.798]  That's 1-888-253-3139, or Infowars.com or Net.
[00:42:26.454 --> 00:42:30.935]  Just get the films, get the word, out to everyone, now.
[00:42:30.935 --> 00:42:33.376]  It's got to be done, now.
[00:42:33.376 --> 00:42:35.936]  Not tomorrow, not next week, not next year.
[00:42:35.936 --> 00:42:40.858]  Infowars.com or net, presentplanet.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[00:42:40.858 --> 00:42:46.039]  Police State 3 is now out.
[00:42:46.039 --> 00:42:49.280]  Barry, how do folks get your film, The Great Deception?
[00:42:52.158 --> 00:42:56.741]  It's pretty bad because my phone, I've had to hire a special assistant just to answer my phone.
[00:42:56.741 --> 00:42:58.602]  But I'll give you the area code is 416.
[00:42:58.602 --> 00:42:59.183]  And the number is 651.
[00:43:04.904 --> 00:43:07.786]  Double 5, double 8.
[00:43:07.786 --> 00:43:09.067]  651-5588.
[00:43:09.067 --> 00:43:11.388]  There's an outgoing message.
[00:43:11.388 --> 00:43:13.630]  Tells you everything you need to know.
[00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:16.512]  We're having an incredible... It looks like we're moving toward 500 sales.
[00:43:21.635 --> 00:43:25.257]  We have an equation here in Canada, it's called the 10% thing.
[00:43:25.257 --> 00:43:29.220]  Because the population of Canada is about one-tenth of the population of USA.
[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:32.482]  So whatever happens to the states, we usually divide it by 10 and figure that's normal.
[00:43:32.482 --> 00:43:34.743]  Okay, for those that don't know, you're a national television host.
[00:43:34.743 --> 00:43:40.867]  You did this on your own, and you write for newspapers, and you just put together this video, and believe me, it'll be a lot more than 500 of you.
[00:43:41.827 --> 00:43:44.109]  Get the word out, but 416-651-5588.
[00:43:44.109 --> 00:43:46.150]  That's it.
[00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:48.692]  Let's take a quick call.
[00:43:48.692 --> 00:43:51.094]  Leave three weeks for the delivery.
[00:43:51.094 --> 00:43:51.534]  Oh, yeah.
[00:43:51.534 --> 00:43:54.316]  Let me tell you, trying to get stuff into Canada is what's hard.
[00:43:54.316 --> 00:43:56.878]  Let's talk to Bill in Alaska.
[00:43:56.878 --> 00:43:57.958]  You're on the air with our guest.
[00:43:57.958 --> 00:43:58.759]  Go ahead.
[00:43:58.759 --> 00:43:59.239]  Yes, sir.
[00:43:59.239 --> 00:44:03.863]  Alex, I just had to call in.
[00:44:03.863 --> 00:44:08.466]  I got an enemy that hasn't been mentioned yet on today's show.
[00:44:09.338 --> 00:44:13.899]  And the American people want to know why this is like this.
[00:44:13.899 --> 00:44:16.719]  All they got to do is look in the mirror.
[00:44:16.719 --> 00:44:25.041]  Jim Jones, in the case in point, I don't believe he was as guilty as the people that followed him.
[00:44:25.041 --> 00:44:30.782]  Because he couldn't have been a bad leader if he hadn't had followers.
[00:44:30.782 --> 00:44:35.823]  There's people that think like George Bush in the homeless shelter up here, but they're no threat to me.
[00:44:35.823 --> 00:44:36.883]  They're not influential.
[00:44:36.883 --> 00:44:38.603]  They haven't been leveraged into position.
[00:44:39.765 --> 00:44:45.447]  In fact, everybody that follows the wrong way is an enemy.
[00:44:45.447 --> 00:44:49.028]  That's why raising cattle is profitable.
[00:44:49.028 --> 00:44:56.511]  The herd is predictable and they can be moved at a profit to the ultimate destination.
[00:44:56.511 --> 00:44:57.791]  That's pretty much all I had to say.
[00:45:04.426 --> 00:45:05.846]  Well, absolutely it is.
[00:45:05.846 --> 00:45:06.527]  One more call.
[00:45:06.527 --> 00:45:08.367]  Let's talk to Brian.
[00:45:08.367 --> 00:45:09.327]  Brian, you're on the air.
[00:45:09.327 --> 00:45:10.027]  Where are you calling from?
[00:45:10.027 --> 00:45:10.968]  Hey, Alex.
[00:45:10.968 --> 00:45:12.108]  I'm calling from Denver.
[00:45:12.108 --> 00:45:12.508]  Okay.
[00:45:12.508 --> 00:45:13.048]  Welcome, sir.
[00:45:13.048 --> 00:45:19.470]  First of all, I want to tell you I appreciate that you guys don't censor your calls like a lot of other radio stations.
[00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:19.730]  No, no.
[00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:22.631]  We don't have to do that here because we tell the truth.
[00:45:22.631 --> 00:45:23.231]  That's correct.
[00:45:23.231 --> 00:45:25.271]  We break conditioning.
[00:45:25.271 --> 00:45:31.653]  I was wondering if you had heard anything about the Bohemian Grove donating $20 million to CU?
[00:45:33.024 --> 00:45:34.966]  And what your thought was on that?
[00:45:34.966 --> 00:45:36.528]  What, to your university?
[00:45:36.528 --> 00:45:37.148]  Yeah.
[00:45:37.148 --> 00:45:38.189]  No, I don't know anything about it.
[00:45:38.189 --> 00:45:39.851]  Of course, I snuck into Bohemian Grove and...
[00:45:40.751 --> 00:45:43.614]  Well, it was on the radio last night.
[00:45:43.614 --> 00:45:45.816]  Or, I'm sorry, not the radio, the news.
[00:45:45.816 --> 00:45:46.396]  Hey, I'll tell you what.
[00:45:46.396 --> 00:45:47.497]  Hold on a second.
[00:45:47.497 --> 00:45:48.578]  Barry, do you have to go?
[00:45:48.578 --> 00:45:49.919]  I don't have to go.
[00:45:49.919 --> 00:45:50.820]  No, I do not.
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.401]  Why don't you stay another 20 minutes?
[00:45:52.401 --> 00:45:53.262]  Oh, thank you.
[00:45:53.262 --> 00:45:54.703]  I'd be happy to.
[00:45:54.703 --> 00:45:57.085]  I love your callers, and there's things to talk about.
[00:45:57.085 --> 00:45:58.527]  Okay, Brian, stay there.
[00:45:58.527 --> 00:46:02.891]  We'll talk about the Skull & Bones Big Boy group that I got made a film about.
[00:46:02.891 --> 00:46:05.012]  And we'll talk to Ken and everybody else.
[00:46:05.012 --> 00:46:05.773]  Everybody stay with me.
[00:46:05.773 --> 00:46:06.314]  We'll be right back.
[00:46:08.763 --> 00:46:12.127]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:46:12.127 --> 00:46:15.351]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals?
[00:46:15.351 --> 00:46:18.715]  Thanks for listening to the N2K Talk Archives.
[00:46:18.715 --> 00:46:22.179]  And we are listener-supported with the honors system.
[00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:23.420]  We ask that you wait.
[00:46:28.716 --> 00:46:30.017]  Big Brother.
[00:46:30.017 --> 00:46:31.779]  Mainstream media.
[00:46:31.779 --> 00:46:33.561]  Government cover-ups.
[00:46:33.561 --> 00:46:35.122]  You want answers?
[00:46:35.122 --> 00:46:36.684]  Well, so does he.
[00:46:36.684 --> 00:46:40.888]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:46:40.888 --> 00:46:44.992]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:50.421]  We're talking to Barry Zwicker.
[00:46:50.421 --> 00:46:53.461]  He is a national media TV critic.
[00:46:53.461 --> 00:46:58.743]  Written for, I don't know, 40 years, 30, 40 years in the newspapers.
[00:46:58.743 --> 00:47:01.163]  And been doing a great job.
[00:47:01.163 --> 00:47:08.645]  We appreciate him coming on the show today to talk about 9-1-1, prior knowledge, and as he said, involvement in the attacks that set up a worldwide police state.
[00:47:09.443 --> 00:47:15.126]  I mean, it's German ministers, it's former military people, it's David Shippers, and we're not the only ones.
[00:47:15.126 --> 00:47:21.369]  There's more and more people saying, the bare minimum that was total prior knowledge, and they allowed it to happen, but the evidence shows they funded it and carried it out.
[00:47:21.369 --> 00:47:23.489]  It's a lot bigger than George Bush or Bill Clinton.
[00:47:23.489 --> 00:47:32.434]  It's that group above them, and they count on you being done, they count on you retreating into the box, and we're going to be taking calls for another 20 minutes with our guest.
[00:47:32.434 --> 00:47:33.594]  You want to join us on air?
[00:47:33.594 --> 00:47:35.095]  We've gotten calls from Alaska to
[00:47:36.267 --> 00:47:37.369]  Boston, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:47:37.369 --> 00:47:43.799]  Brian in Colorado, listening to us on one of the fine AMs there in Denver, mentioned
[00:47:49.924 --> 00:48:00.172]  Bohemian Grove, that's where the big boys, when they're old men, the Skull and Bone people go to a place called Bohemian Grove, and I snuck in, it was on national television on the Trio Network, and they're doing their satanic rituals right there.
[00:48:00.172 --> 00:48:08.058]  I know this sounds crazy, but it was on TV, they admit it is a ritual, they admit I got the video, they just say, oh well, my interpretation is different than theirs.
[00:48:08.058 --> 00:48:17.365]  This shows how loony tunes they are, these world leaders that go there, and you were saying that Bohemian Grove gave $20 million to what university, Brian?
[00:48:17.365 --> 00:48:17.866]  The CU?
[00:48:19.264 --> 00:48:21.285]  And what news channel do you see that on?
[00:48:21.285 --> 00:48:22.905]  On Channel 7 and Channel 9.
[00:48:22.905 --> 00:48:27.366]  It was on last night on their... And what did they say?
[00:48:27.366 --> 00:48:28.207]  The Bohemian Grove?
[00:48:28.207 --> 00:48:30.607]  What did they say the Bohemian Grove was?
[00:48:30.607 --> 00:48:34.348]  Uh, they said it was just a Bohemian Grove.
[00:48:34.348 --> 00:48:37.229]  I'm assuming it's the same Bohemian Grove you've been talking about.
[00:48:37.229 --> 00:48:38.590]  Well, I got a video about it.
[00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:39.230]  Right.
[00:48:40.761 --> 00:48:43.002]  Barry, have you ever heard of Bohemian Grove?
[00:48:43.002 --> 00:48:44.762]  I've certainly heard of Bohemian Grove.
[00:48:44.762 --> 00:48:46.803]  I heard about it maybe ten years ago.
[00:48:46.803 --> 00:48:53.385]  My understanding was, and I'm probably out of date on this, my understanding was that it's a private club.
[00:48:53.385 --> 00:48:55.325]  You probably couldn't get back in now.
[00:48:55.325 --> 00:48:57.706]  I think they've tightened the security a lot.
[00:48:57.706 --> 00:49:06.008]  But it's a club where once a year, especially, these top leaders go, sort of members of the Trilateral Commission, the Byszynskis and so on.
[00:49:06.008 --> 00:49:07.669]  And they dress up in red and black robes.
[00:49:07.669 --> 00:49:08.369]  I have them on tape.
[00:49:08.889 --> 00:49:10.310]  There you go.
[00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:11.511]  They like to dress up.
[00:49:11.511 --> 00:49:13.212]  I must say these people like to dress up.
[00:49:13.212 --> 00:49:16.174]  It's like our own Conrad Black, a multi-millionaire from Canada.
[00:49:16.174 --> 00:49:18.796]  He owns the Chicago Sun-Times and so on.
[00:49:18.796 --> 00:49:21.498]  He couldn't wait to be a British Lord.
[00:49:21.498 --> 00:49:22.978]  They call him Lord Crossover.
[00:49:22.978 --> 00:49:27.862]  He has these great robes and he also likes to dress up like Napoleon.
[00:49:27.862 --> 00:49:34.146]  He's a very great student of Napoleonic military strategy, which actually he's used quite well in his business dealings.
[00:49:34.586 --> 00:49:45.479]  But there's something about these people, they just crave power, they crave pomp, they crave circumstance, they crave influence, they crave great wealth and riches, and that's what they go after.
[00:49:45.479 --> 00:49:48.342]  Well let's say it, they are ultra-control freaks.
[00:49:48.342 --> 00:49:49.484]  They really are.
[00:49:49.484 --> 00:49:51.907]  Vicious, ferret-like creatures.
[00:49:51.907 --> 00:49:52.067]  Yep.
[00:49:52.958 --> 00:49:58.522]  And you know, you were mentioning earlier about we gotta do our homework, we gotta pay attention.
[00:49:58.522 --> 00:50:01.624]  I like what Miles Davis said.
[00:50:01.624 --> 00:50:06.188]  Miles Davis said, if you ain't apprehensive, you ain't paying attention!
[00:50:06.188 --> 00:50:07.429]  Yeah, I've seen that bumper sticker.
[00:50:08.667 --> 00:50:09.188]  Absolutely.
[00:50:09.188 --> 00:50:10.328]  Anything else, Brian?
[00:50:10.328 --> 00:50:16.333]  Well, I was just wondering what you think their motivation behind $20 million to a college?
[00:50:16.333 --> 00:50:17.774]  Well, it's not control.
[00:50:17.774 --> 00:50:22.357]  Also, we know Skull & Bones does not just have chapters in Yale.
[00:50:22.357 --> 00:50:25.960]  They have covert chapters in at least 10 universities we have identified.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:30.604]  UT has one, and this is how they control things.
[00:50:30.604 --> 00:50:30.824]  Okay.
[00:50:31.494 --> 00:50:34.557]  Can I just jump in there and agree with Alex?
[00:50:34.557 --> 00:50:46.686]  Because, you know, there's a widespread belief, and I only wish it was true, that universities, the academy you might call it, are places where people seek disinterested truth.
[00:50:46.686 --> 00:50:48.127]  The truth wherever it may lead.
[00:50:48.127 --> 00:50:51.770]  They just do solid scientific research and so on.
[00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:56.774]  Regrettably, a lot of the universities get bought off by these multi-million dollar grants.
[00:50:57.374 --> 00:51:03.636]  And of course, Noam Chomsky is a good guy who's written about how you cannot depend on intellectuals to blow the whistle on tyranny.
[00:51:03.636 --> 00:51:06.517]  It turns out it's ordinary people who blow the whistle on tyranny.
[00:51:06.517 --> 00:51:06.997]  You got it.
[00:51:06.997 --> 00:51:09.098]  We'll be right back with the final segment with our guest.
[00:51:09.098 --> 00:51:10.698]  Thanks for the call, Brian.
[00:51:10.698 --> 00:51:13.559]  We'll go and we'll talk to John and others.
[00:51:13.559 --> 00:51:15.580]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:16.540]  More news coming up as well.
[00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:17.661]  Keep it locked in.
[00:51:17.661 --> 00:51:19.521]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:51:25.923 --> 00:51:31.565]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:31.565 --> 00:51:33.046]  Can you get past the fear?
[00:51:33.046 --> 00:51:36.267]  Can you invoke the truth of what's happened in the world?
[00:51:36.267 --> 00:51:40.469]  Military industrial complex owned by private banks imploding.
[00:51:40.469 --> 00:51:46.311]  A financial system keeping you rallied around the government while they do it by using terror to scare you into submission.
[00:51:46.311 --> 00:51:50.413]  I'm talking to a man who's written for the Globe and Mail, Toronto Star.
[00:51:50.413 --> 00:51:53.534]  He's Vision TV's media critic, studies the media.
[00:51:54.702 --> 00:51:58.524]  And he's come out saying the Globals were behind 9-1-1.
[00:51:58.524 --> 00:52:00.584]  And he's Barry Zwicker.
[00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:04.506]  And we're about to go back to the calls.
[00:52:04.506 --> 00:52:06.547]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Elias in Michigan.
[00:52:06.547 --> 00:52:07.427]  Go ahead, sir, on the air.
[00:52:07.427 --> 00:52:07.927]  Hello, yeah.
[00:52:07.927 --> 00:52:09.688]  I wanted to thank you, your guest.
[00:52:23.757 --> 00:52:27.399]  That I have a book and it's written by Conrad Haydn.
[00:52:27.399 --> 00:52:29.100]  I don't know if you've heard of him.
[00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:33.682]  It's titled is Durfuer, Hitler's Rise to Power.
[00:52:33.682 --> 00:52:45.448]  I would recommend it to anyone who's interested in that kind of a thing because evidently Conrad Haydn knew Hitler, not personally, but he was there.
[00:52:46.525 --> 00:52:47.846]  He saw it all.
[00:52:47.846 --> 00:52:52.248]  And we're seeing a frightening repeat of it, even the same fascist trappings.
[00:52:52.248 --> 00:52:53.269]  Right, right.
[00:52:53.269 --> 00:53:03.914]  And another thing I wanted to say was, listening on Shortwave, I picked up Ramsey Clark's speech to the National Press Club.
[00:53:03.914 --> 00:53:04.975]  It was very good.
[00:53:04.975 --> 00:53:09.878]  I don't agree with Clark on a lot of things, but he was definitely on target during that speech.
[00:53:09.878 --> 00:53:13.380]  He's a fellow Texan of yours.
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:14.180]  He what?
[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:15.681]  Isn't he a fellow Texan?
[00:53:16.525 --> 00:53:20.534]  Well, yeah, he helped us rebuild, uh, the Branch Davidian Church and, uh, yeah.
[00:53:20.534 --> 00:53:21.877]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:21.877 --> 00:53:23.360]  He did a great speech there.
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.322]  I heard most of it.
[00:53:25.308 --> 00:53:27.089]  For those that don't know, we're not branch Davidians.
[00:53:27.089 --> 00:53:29.250]  We built a memorial church there for them.
[00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:30.190]  Yeah, right, right.
[00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:30.670]  Yeah.
[00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:31.611]  All right, Elias.
[00:53:31.611 --> 00:53:32.931]  Thanks for the call.
[00:53:32.931 --> 00:53:38.273]  Yeah, that was a good speech you gave about the total media control, the manipulation, the takeover.
[00:53:38.273 --> 00:53:41.615]  I mean, now they're talking about invading North Korea, Iran, Iraq.
[00:53:41.615 --> 00:53:43.255]  We're already going to Iraq.
[00:53:43.255 --> 00:53:44.476]  Syria.
[00:53:44.476 --> 00:53:45.156]  Endless war.
[00:53:45.156 --> 00:53:48.237]  You know, Bush said a hundred year war, Barry.
[00:53:48.237 --> 00:53:50.518]  When did we hear talk of hundred year wars?
[00:53:50.518 --> 00:53:51.719]  Endless war for peace.
[00:53:52.339 --> 00:53:54.660]  Yeah, well, you know, again, it's one of the parallels.
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:54:03.425]  I'm drawing up actually a whole spreadsheet, you know, a computer spreadsheet of the parallels between the Bush regime and Hitler.
[00:54:03.425 --> 00:54:11.729]  And Hitler, you can read it in the histories about him, he said every country should have a good war at least every 20 years.
[00:54:11.729 --> 00:54:14.771]  He considered it cleaned up people's souls or something like that.
[00:54:15.251 --> 00:54:23.804]  By the way, Alex, may I put in something here that before we finish our time together, I have a question for you that I'm burning to ask.
[00:54:23.804 --> 00:54:24.285]  Okay.
[00:54:24.285 --> 00:54:26.648]  Let's make sure that... Do you want me to ask it now?
[00:54:26.648 --> 00:54:27.289]  Go ahead, sure.
[00:54:27.289 --> 00:54:28.451]  Yeah, it's this.
[00:54:28.451 --> 00:54:30.594]  You and I have had, and many others,
[00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:36.477]  I've had very parallel experiences since 9-11, where we twigged to the extreme fishiness of it.
[00:54:36.477 --> 00:54:39.159]  We've been talking about it, seeing all sorts of reactions.
[00:54:39.159 --> 00:54:45.682]  Incredibly, very, very positive reactions, where you would think that, and most people think, oh my gosh, you'd get negative ones.
[00:54:45.682 --> 00:54:47.183]  So, we've been going through this.
[00:54:47.183 --> 00:54:52.266]  Now, I am detecting, I think, and this is what I want to ask you, what you're detecting.
[00:54:52.266 --> 00:54:54.407]  I seem to feel, it's 20 minutes, 20 months, 20 months,
[00:54:56.908 --> 00:55:02.914]  To the day, last Sunday, since this thing happened, this 9-11 thing happened.
[00:55:02.914 --> 00:55:13.684]  And I get the feeling that somehow, in the mass public, there is a stirring of a willingness to actually start to ask some serious questions about it.
[00:55:13.684 --> 00:55:18.348]  Now, you're a big radio guy, big audience, bigger than I have.
[00:55:18.348 --> 00:55:19.149]  What are you picking up?
[00:55:20.114 --> 00:55:33.981]  No, I'm getting the exact same thing, because more and more prominent people... I mean, when the German technology minister comes out and says the globalists did it, the military did it, for open world dictatorship, I mean, they're in trouble.
[00:55:33.981 --> 00:55:37.783]  There are thousands of hosts that I know of.
[00:55:37.783 --> 00:55:41.825]  Let's just say hundreds, but there's thousands out there that are discussing it.
[00:55:41.825 --> 00:55:45.807]  Thousands of websites, dozens of videos, hundreds of books.
[00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:48.971]  They've got to go for it all now.
[00:55:48.971 --> 00:55:49.691]  That's the problem.
[00:55:49.691 --> 00:55:51.351]  They're going to keep turning the heat up.
[00:55:51.351 --> 00:55:53.292]  We're probably going to see more terror.
[00:55:53.292 --> 00:55:58.933]  These homeland security drills, these top-off drills are for martial law.
[00:55:58.933 --> 00:56:00.133]  They sit under a red alert.
[00:56:00.133 --> 00:56:01.154]  We can't leave our houses.
[00:56:01.154 --> 00:56:02.254]  We'll be the enemy.
[00:56:02.254 --> 00:56:05.855]  I think that regardless they were going to drop the hammer, but they're racing.
[00:56:05.855 --> 00:56:08.175]  I think they're probably going to drop the hammer and accelerate things.
[00:56:08.175 --> 00:56:09.376]  They've got to.
[00:56:09.376 --> 00:56:12.056]  They're in like a terminal velocity for their empire.
[00:56:12.056 --> 00:56:14.737]  They've got to go to the next level or they're going to implode.
[00:56:15.277 --> 00:56:16.680]  Yeah.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:17.882]  That rings true to me, Alex.
[00:56:17.882 --> 00:56:19.846]  Now, let me ask you another question.
[00:56:21.865 --> 00:56:25.286]  People like you and I, we know it's the only game in town.
[00:56:25.286 --> 00:56:26.867]  We've got to speak the truth as we see it.
[00:56:26.867 --> 00:56:30.768]  We've got to continue to learn, to refine our understandings.
[00:56:30.768 --> 00:56:35.210]  It's a lifelong job being a student of everything and speaking out without fear.
[00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:35.950]  We have to do that.
[00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:36.730]  We are doing that.
[00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:43.072]  A lot of people are doing that and yet we do know at the same time that the mass consciousness is actually false on this.
[00:56:43.072 --> 00:56:44.553]  It's a false consciousness.
[00:56:46.414 --> 00:57:01.353]  90% of us could all know the truth, but we don't talk to each other, we don't have the venues, so Peter Jennings says we're still all buying it, so that creates the illusion that everybody else is against us, so that keeps us from basically crystallizing and connecting.
[00:57:01.893 --> 00:57:06.737]  We've got to push that over the edge and it's going to happen.
[00:57:06.737 --> 00:57:16.786]  I was dreaming, you know, dreaming in Technicolor, that a large paper such as the New York Times, or even a Canadian paper, and I went to journalists, I went to top journalists, investigative journalists.
[00:57:16.786 --> 00:57:21.230]  I've done investigative journalism, I'm partly an investigative journalist, but I'm primarily not.
[00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:23.852]  I'm primarily a regular journalist and a commentator.
[00:57:23.852 --> 00:57:27.175]  I went to these people, I went to the two top investigative reporters in Canada.
[00:57:27.595 --> 00:57:29.776]  Early on, I said, there's a huge story here.
[00:57:29.776 --> 00:57:31.196]  They say, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:57:31.196 --> 00:57:33.797]  One just refuses to look at it to this day.
[00:57:33.797 --> 00:57:35.437]  The other one said, yeah, I think I'll do something.
[00:57:35.437 --> 00:57:36.558]  Never did.
[00:57:36.558 --> 00:57:52.303]  You know, it's incredible that if one major daily newspaper in the United States or Canada were to come out with a series saying, look, we've got big questions, put it on a front page, big headline, they would collect more journalistic, they'd have to invent new journalistic prizes for such a paper.
[00:57:52.303 --> 00:57:54.703]  And that could really be an iconic turning point.
[00:57:54.703 --> 00:57:56.344]  But I guess it's not going to happen, eh, Alex?
[00:57:58.271 --> 00:58:01.233]  Well, I mean, when you talk about the New York Times and these guys, they're all loaned.
[00:58:01.233 --> 00:58:07.356]  I mean, the owners of the Washington Post go to the Bilderberg Group meetings, who are openly calling for world government, so... Yep.
[00:58:07.356 --> 00:58:09.697]  Like, in other words, it just ain't gonna happen that way, eh?
[00:58:09.697 --> 00:58:12.779]  Well, they're putting out... Like, there won't be another Pentagon Papers.
[00:58:12.779 --> 00:58:14.499]  Well, I mean, first they said there's no prior knowledge.
[00:58:14.499 --> 00:58:17.621]  We prove that, they go, okay, but it's an accident, just give us more power.
[00:58:17.621 --> 00:58:17.861]  Yeah.
[00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:20.702]  Okay, there is some motive, but let's not discuss it.
[00:58:20.702 --> 00:58:25.705]  They're having to say something just to alleviate, like, we go, oh, the media's on to it.
[00:58:26.354 --> 00:58:27.415]  But it's amazing.
[00:58:27.415 --> 00:58:29.417]  Let's go ahead and go to some calls here.
[00:58:29.417 --> 00:58:31.399]  Thanks for answering that, Alex.
[00:58:31.399 --> 00:58:31.899]  Oh, you bet.
[00:58:31.899 --> 00:58:33.201]  Let's talk to Ken in Iowa.
[00:58:33.201 --> 00:58:34.602]  Ken, you're on the air with our guest.
[00:58:34.602 --> 00:58:36.744]  Go ahead.
[00:58:36.744 --> 00:58:37.224]  Hello?
[00:58:37.224 --> 00:58:38.385]  Yes, Ken.
[00:58:38.385 --> 00:58:39.286]  Hello.
[00:58:39.286 --> 00:58:40.988]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:58:40.988 --> 00:58:42.990]  I had a couple questions.
[00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:48.275]  First, I don't know if you've ever heard of the Strecker Mirandum by Dr. Strecker.
[00:58:49.949 --> 00:58:54.512]  He was, I only read a paper of his, but it was about AIDS and how that was created by man.
[00:58:54.512 --> 00:58:56.413]  Boy, that's a bad fact.
[00:58:56.413 --> 00:58:57.613]  I've done whole shows on it.
[00:58:57.613 --> 00:59:02.356]  We have the weapons documents, we have the patents created by the government, and yeah.
[00:59:02.356 --> 00:59:08.920]  Well, I was going to ask you, do you think that this whole SARS thing is like another population type control by the U.N.? ?
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:15.266]  Operation for quarantine and martial law having a smoke screen of some type of biological outbreak.
[00:59:15.266 --> 00:59:21.773]  Globalist power papers, the white papers they write, they've said this would be perfect to use to get total control.
[00:59:21.773 --> 00:59:22.875]  So it's in their bag.
[00:59:22.875 --> 00:59:26.839]  Dirty bombs, biologicals, more conventional soft targets being hit.
[00:59:27.715 --> 00:59:32.700]  You know, Putin got caught blowing up his own buildings in 1999 to get martial law going in Russia again.
[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:34.921]  It's the same story over and over again.
[00:59:34.921 --> 00:59:38.264]  They've got different scripts they could activate.
[00:59:38.264 --> 00:59:53.037]  Their biggest problem is there's only a few thousand globalists, a few thousand minions they can trust, and they're trying to basically do a balancing act with, you know, a hundred plates in each hand, and the gyrations they're having to follow are getting harder and harder.
[00:59:53.655 --> 01:00:00.898]  Is that why they had that kind of, like with the anthrax and then September 11th and now we have... Yeah, anthrax turned out, Fort Detrick, Maryland, most weaponized form ever seen.
[01:00:00.898 --> 01:00:07.420]  Bush on Cipro with his cabinet on September 10th, four weeks before it showed up, Boca Raton, yeah.
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:09.981]  Yeah, one guy called it government by anthrax.
[01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:12.082]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:00:12.082 --> 01:00:16.023]  It came out in Reuters overseas that, oh yeah, the government did it, then you never heard about it again.
[01:00:17.513 --> 01:00:19.874]  Your caller was asking about stars, Alex.
[01:00:19.874 --> 01:00:20.474]  Yes.
[01:00:20.474 --> 01:00:23.756]  And for my part, I do think it's really fishy.
[01:00:23.756 --> 01:00:28.438]  There's a microbiologist in Vancouver, B.C., and he's not alone.
[01:00:28.438 --> 01:00:30.259]  There's another one in Winnipeg.
[01:00:30.259 --> 01:00:32.940]  Just to consider microbiologists here north of the border.
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:38.305]  And they just say they cannot trace it down as a natural coronavirus.
[01:00:38.305 --> 01:00:40.907]  They just say we cannot find it in nature.
[01:00:40.907 --> 01:00:43.169]  And some Russian scientists have said the same thing.
[01:00:43.169 --> 01:00:46.152]  It looks suspiciously as if it's probably man-made.
[01:00:46.152 --> 01:00:48.294]  I also think it's suspicious about where it started.
[01:00:48.294 --> 01:00:55.200]  I know Guangdong province is a province where humans and other animals, like chickens and so on, live in close proximity.
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:59.264]  And you can have the virus jump from the non-human animal population.
[01:00:59.684 --> 01:01:02.086]  You have it when you have too many in a mash.
[01:01:02.086 --> 01:01:04.607]  Thanks for the call, Ken.
[01:01:04.607 --> 01:01:08.850]  Let's talk to Dan in California.
[01:01:08.850 --> 01:01:10.731]  You're on the air, or David in California.
[01:01:10.731 --> 01:01:11.632]  Go ahead.
[01:01:11.632 --> 01:01:12.132]  Hey, Alex.
[01:01:12.132 --> 01:01:12.553]  Good morning.
[01:01:12.553 --> 01:01:13.693]  How are you doing?
[01:01:13.693 --> 01:01:15.114]  Got another great show going, man.
[01:01:15.114 --> 01:01:17.956]  I just have a brief comment.
[01:01:17.956 --> 01:01:23.360]  Occasionally you apologize for getting so wound up and yelling and all that, but I just want you to know that
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.562]  The stuff that you're yelling about deserves to be yelled about, man.
[01:01:26.562 --> 01:01:29.685]  So don't take it too hard when you get wound up.
[01:01:29.685 --> 01:01:32.947]  Sometimes it helps us that you get so wound up.
[01:01:32.947 --> 01:01:45.658]  So let me just finish by saying to those people who want to knuckle under to all these clowns out there that want to allow this tyranny to come down on us, you all better get ready to
[01:01:46.238 --> 01:01:50.681]  Click your heels, learn how to click your heels, and learn how to say, Big How!
[01:01:50.681 --> 01:01:52.362]  Because that's what's coming, people.
[01:01:52.362 --> 01:01:53.603]  Just get used to it.
[01:01:53.603 --> 01:02:00.287]  You know, I watched Reggie a year ago on TV, on C-SPAN, and he said, to have a job, you'll have a federal ID card.
[01:02:00.287 --> 01:02:01.728]  That you'll be screened.
[01:02:01.728 --> 01:02:05.091]  There's going to be troops in the factories, like something out of Red Dawn.
[01:02:05.091 --> 01:02:12.275]  I mean, folks, the country they're setting up is nightmarish.
[01:02:12.275 --> 01:02:13.216]  You know, the last word,
[01:02:13.895 --> 01:02:20.680]  In control of labor is a labor camp, where people don't get paid at all, they just get the smallest rations they can.
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:26.765]  Did you hear about the Oregon law, where if one protester blocks a street, they all get life in prison in a labor camp?
[01:02:26.765 --> 01:02:27.286]  Yeah.
[01:02:27.286 --> 01:02:31.209]  It actually says, labor camp.
[01:02:31.209 --> 01:02:32.289]  Yep.
[01:02:32.289 --> 01:02:32.530]  Yep.
[01:02:32.530 --> 01:02:37.814]  Did you hear about the Rocky Mountain News, where they've got incinerators and mass graves?
[01:02:37.814 --> 01:02:39.335]  I'm not kidding, it says it!
[01:02:39.335 --> 01:02:40.596]  It's because they love us, Alex.
[01:02:42.119 --> 01:02:44.702]  Well, they're not going to be able to get away with it and pull it, and thanks for the call.
[01:02:44.702 --> 01:02:47.085]  I like that sense of humor from California.
[01:02:47.085 --> 01:02:47.506]  You know what?
[01:02:47.506 --> 01:02:53.053]  I think what they're doing is so horrible, I think the laziness and the decadence is actually going to work against them.
[01:02:53.053 --> 01:02:56.457]  I mean, the healthcare workers wouldn't take a smallpox shot, would they?
[01:02:56.457 --> 01:02:57.138]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:02:58.570 --> 01:03:01.791]  One more segment with us and I'll let you go, because I want you to have a chance to say some final words.
[01:03:01.791 --> 01:03:02.812]  I've been taking all these calls.
[01:03:02.812 --> 01:03:05.873]  Stay right there, Barry, and we'll come back to you.
[01:03:05.873 --> 01:03:06.954]  Will do.
[01:03:06.954 --> 01:03:12.316]  All right, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.net, and we'll come back.
[01:03:12.316 --> 01:03:15.998]  If there's any websites that Barry wants to plug, that's great.
[01:03:15.998 --> 01:03:17.939]  He's the Vision TV media critic.
[01:03:17.939 --> 01:03:20.800]  He's come out and told the truth about the globalists because he cares about humanity.
[01:03:22.588 --> 01:03:25.951]  Thanks for listening to the M2K Talk Archives.
[01:03:25.951 --> 01:03:29.414]  And we are listener-supported with the honor system.
[01:03:29.414 --> 01:03:31.055]  We ask that you wait.
[01:03:31.055 --> 01:03:32.936]  Don't donate a dollar at a time.
[01:03:32.936 --> 01:03:38.521]  PayPal charges a 35-cent surcharge on anything of a dollar or less.
[01:03:38.521 --> 01:03:42.024]  Wait till you listen to five or ten, and then donate, please.
[01:03:42.024 --> 01:03:44.306]  We appreciate your voluntary support.
[01:03:44.306 --> 01:03:50.190]  The political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:52.072]  Alright, one final
[01:03:53.673 --> 01:03:55.954]  My question is, what do you think of these Texas Democrats?
[01:04:21.926 --> 01:04:25.808]  I think it's wonderful that they're not going along with the control.
[01:04:25.808 --> 01:04:34.150]  This is what they used to do 100 years ago in this country, 200 years ago in this country, walking out, shutting government down is what the founding fathers called for.
[01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:37.471]  Now hundreds of evil bills, I've looked at them, almost all of them are bad.
[01:04:37.471 --> 01:04:41.853]  I mean, we've got millions of laws in this country, hundreds of thousands for each major state.
[01:04:42.473 --> 01:04:44.455]  And them walking out is a great tactic.
[01:04:44.455 --> 01:04:46.296]  Gridlock in government is good.
[01:04:46.296 --> 01:04:47.457]  Separation of powers.
[01:04:47.457 --> 01:04:51.000]  They're not going along with the federal power grab going on in Texas.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.401]  And I hope it spreads.
[01:04:52.401 --> 01:04:55.963]  Were you aware of the arrest warrant for 53 members of the House?
[01:04:55.963 --> 01:04:59.406]  And they've arrested some other ones here in Texas for... Well, yes I am.
[01:04:59.406 --> 01:05:02.928]  And you know that... I wanted to get Mary's response.
[01:05:02.928 --> 01:05:03.509]  Were you aware of that?
[01:05:04.469 --> 01:05:07.672]  Well yeah, I read about that in the papers.
[01:05:07.672 --> 01:05:10.433]  I know Tim in Oklahoma, he's got something to say there.
[01:05:10.433 --> 01:05:17.998]  I'll just quickly put in that when I read the legislation that the Republicans in Texas are trying to push through, it's practically blood curdling.
[01:05:17.998 --> 01:05:23.402]  They just want to close down anything that's compassionate and build up everything for everybody who's already doing it.
[01:05:23.402 --> 01:05:23.822]  Well let me explain.
[01:05:23.822 --> 01:05:30.286]  They use socialism to get us all addicted to government, then they transfer into the fascist phase of privatization.
[01:05:30.286 --> 01:05:30.907]  It's amazing.
[01:05:30.907 --> 01:05:31.407]  Go ahead sir.
[01:05:32.548 --> 01:05:40.774]  Yeah, and also that the government of Oklahoma actually welcomes and applauds the Texas insurgency.
[01:05:40.774 --> 01:05:41.395]  Well, that's good.
[01:05:41.395 --> 01:05:45.658]  I mean, if the Republicans were running out and leaving government to fall apart, I'd love it.
[01:05:45.658 --> 01:05:47.119]  We need more of this.
[01:05:47.119 --> 01:05:52.364]  And is this maybe something that the actual D.C.
[01:05:52.364 --> 01:05:54.645]  Democrats need to look at as being a
[01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:57.939]  Insurgency against Republicans.
[01:05:57.939 --> 01:06:04.404]  I'm not an expert on those particular Roberts rules, but I think they're the same, basically, and it is a good idea.
[01:06:04.404 --> 01:06:10.329]  I mean, basically, the Democrats have been a bunch of spineless weasels in D.C.
[01:06:10.329 --> 01:06:13.651]  for the most part, bending over for whatever legislation they want.
[01:06:13.651 --> 01:06:14.772]  Well, they're all in the same trough.
[01:06:14.772 --> 01:06:15.793]  They're all in the same trough.
[01:06:16.573 --> 01:06:17.193]  Yeah.
[01:06:17.193 --> 01:06:18.354]  And it's just embarrassing.
[01:06:18.354 --> 01:06:26.476]  I mean, if we want to get Bush out of office, which I think is the actual deal... Let me be clear, sir, because this can hurt us.
[01:06:26.476 --> 01:06:27.496]  Bush is a puppet.
[01:06:27.496 --> 01:06:28.877]  Clinton was a puppet.
[01:06:28.877 --> 01:06:30.237]  It's the current phase.
[01:06:30.237 --> 01:06:31.438]  That's why all this is happening.
[01:06:31.438 --> 01:06:36.519]  It's the New World Order takeover.
[01:06:36.519 --> 01:06:37.960]  Look, you put John Kerry in there.
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.080]  They're both from Skull & Bones.
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.101]  It's the same choice.
[01:06:41.101 --> 01:06:42.241]  Go ahead.
[01:06:42.241 --> 01:06:45.462]  But I really think that, you know, in order for
[01:06:47.421 --> 01:06:53.082]  Anything to happen right now, somebody's got to stand up and have a backbone against this entire new world order.
[01:06:53.082 --> 01:06:54.423]  No, I think Bush should be impeached.
[01:06:54.423 --> 01:06:55.843]  I thought Bill Clinton should be impeached.
[01:06:55.843 --> 01:06:57.403]  I hardly agree with you.
[01:06:57.403 --> 01:07:00.404]  I'm just saying, don't think that some Democrat's going to save you.
[01:07:00.404 --> 01:07:03.685]  Well, it's pretty much, I'm thinking, all we've got right now.
[01:07:03.685 --> 01:07:06.505]  Well, maybe the separation of powers.
[01:07:06.505 --> 01:07:10.446]  I mean, if we had an Al Gore, the conservatives would be awake to his evil and we wouldn't be in this shape.
[01:07:11.833 --> 01:07:15.355]  Usually conservatives are more active against a complex political issue.
[01:07:15.355 --> 01:07:16.056]  Thanks for the call.
[01:07:16.056 --> 01:07:16.877]  Gotta let you go.
[01:07:16.877 --> 01:07:18.558]  You've got a few minutes left, Barry.
[01:07:18.558 --> 01:07:20.560]  Anything else you want to add for the listenership?
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:25.584]  Well, I would, and I'd like to follow up on what Tim was saying, and I really agree with Tim.
[01:07:25.584 --> 01:07:35.812]  I think, and also following up on your responses to the questions that I was asking you, Alex, I think change never, ever starts at the center.
[01:07:35.812 --> 01:07:39.535]  Now, the Democrats are at the center, regrettably, most of them.
[01:07:40.577 --> 01:07:42.478]  Change always happens at the fringes.
[01:07:42.478 --> 01:07:46.759]  I don't want to say fringes in the sense of just a fringe movement or fringe idea.
[01:07:46.759 --> 01:07:50.520]  I mean... It's always highly motivated, cutting-edge groups that change history.
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:51.020]  Exactly.
[01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:54.200]  You know a person, they cry in the wilderness at first.
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.101]  And something I like is that statement I believe Gandhi made.
[01:07:57.101 --> 01:08:00.382]  He said, first they ignore you, then they attack you, then you win.
[01:08:01.683 --> 01:08:25.917]  And I think that there's enough of us at the so-called fringes, enough of us who are outside of the power centers, who aren't corrupted by those power centers, and I think if we gain enough strength, and everybody who has the slightest suspicion, even one suspicion about the events of 9-11, for instance, has got a duty, I would say it's a duty, to, A, not be afraid,
[01:08:27.927 --> 01:08:28.667]  Tell ten people.
[01:08:28.667 --> 01:08:34.990]  You know that somebody said that the greatest peace talks in the world are the ones done over people's back fences.
[01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:37.171]  And what you've got to do is talk to your neighbors.
[01:08:37.171 --> 01:08:38.111]  Do whatever you can.
[01:08:38.111 --> 01:08:39.972]  If you're a plumber, talk to your customers.
[01:08:39.972 --> 01:08:42.693]  You know, if you're a journalist, go on air.
[01:08:42.693 --> 01:08:47.314]  And if you're a psychiatrist, tell people they're crazy if they believe in Bush.
[01:08:47.314 --> 01:08:48.795]  And I think everybody can do something.
[01:08:48.795 --> 01:08:50.516]  Absolutely, everybody can do something.
[01:08:50.516 --> 01:08:54.497]  The important thing is not to feel fear, to educate yourself, and then do something.
[01:08:54.677 --> 01:08:56.578]  Well, absolutely, and we don't have a choice.
[01:08:56.578 --> 01:08:59.278]  I mean, this system is just attacking us at every level.
[01:08:59.278 --> 01:09:03.319]  If folks want a copy of your video, The Grand Deception, 416-651-5588.
[01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:03.979]  416-651-5588.
[01:09:03.979 --> 01:09:09.301]  Any websites you want to plug?
[01:09:09.301 --> 01:09:11.861]  Well, I think a good website, there's a lot of them, you know.
[01:09:11.861 --> 01:09:14.522]  You probably have a deception dollar with you, right, Alex?
[01:09:14.522 --> 01:09:15.082]  Oh, sure.
[01:09:15.082 --> 01:09:16.743]  Yeah, so I like the one, 911PI.
[01:09:16.743 --> 01:09:17.443]  991peterindia.com.
[01:09:21.925 --> 01:09:23.630]  And you can go to a lot of websites.
[01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:24.773]  Alright, gotta let you go.
[01:09:24.773 --> 01:09:26.157]  Great having you on for an hour and a half.
[01:09:26.157 --> 01:09:26.939]  We'll have you back up.
[01:09:26.939 --> 01:09:27.621]  Godspeed.
[01:09:27.621 --> 01:09:28.383]  Thank you.
[01:09:28.383 --> 01:09:29.145]  I'll be right back.
[01:09:29.145 --> 01:09:29.566]  Stay with me.
