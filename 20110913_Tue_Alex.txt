[00:53.280 --> 00:58.800]  myself the listeners all of us even though we're awake we're just becoming
[00:58.800 --> 01:04.920]  acclimated and conditioned ten years ago if something like fast and furious
[01:04.920 --> 01:10.040]  happened and we caught the government I would be much more upset about it on air
[01:10.040 --> 01:15.680]  and I'd probably be talking about it at nauseam but now things of the magnitude
[01:15.680 --> 01:19.000]  of fast and furious with the government shipping guns into Illinois
[01:19.000 --> 01:25.560]  Indiana Florida California Texas to drug gangs to kill their competition
[01:25.560 --> 01:30.680]  shipping guns into Honduras into Mexico to kill their competition and to
[01:30.680 --> 01:34.600]  destabilize those areas and then demonize the second amendment that would
[01:34.600 --> 01:40.600]  be a bigger issue there had been articles in the Chicago Tribune articles
[01:40.600 --> 01:45.480]  in the El Paso times in the last month of course we had articles three months
[01:45.480 --> 01:51.400]  ago actually broke it at info wars.com Paul Watson did because a listener
[01:51.400 --> 01:55.920]  sent us hey have you seen these federal filings where the federal government is
[01:55.920 --> 02:00.440]  admitting that the CIA was allowing cocaine to be shipped into the United
[02:00.440 --> 02:06.240]  States by the Sinaloa drug gang one of the biggest cartels on the border in
[02:06.240 --> 02:08.920]  exchange for going after the competition and laundering their money
[02:08.920 --> 02:13.520]  through certain US banks and it just comes out in mainstream news and we
[02:13.520 --> 02:19.520]  mention it we talk about it then we move on we move on it has the desired
[02:19.520 --> 02:26.120]  psychological warfare effect on us in a way I'm weak-minded compared to a lot of
[02:26.120 --> 02:30.440]  people we're strong but we're still very weak we're all human the globalist
[02:30.440 --> 02:35.680]  understand what makes us tick and how to punch those buttons they have ABC News
[02:35.680 --> 02:42.600]  BBC Fox News Reuters video I mean I could play more than 20 different newscasts
[02:42.600 --> 02:46.480]  here and I have played most of them where they go yeah our troops grow the
[02:46.480 --> 02:49.720]  opium give them the fertilizer and we they loaded on trucks and it just
[02:49.720 --> 02:57.400]  disappears it's just for America if you're not for growing the opium you're
[02:57.400 --> 02:59.960]  with al-Qaeda
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.640]  they just do this stuff out in the open now and so instead of just denying the
[03:07.640 --> 03:11.720]  stuff like they do 15 years ago now they just go yeah we're doing it now let's
[03:11.720 --> 03:17.640]  move on hey you're getting all the bombers into the US and onto the
[03:17.640 --> 03:22.520]  airplanes and and on to Fort Hood and and and the government's been caught
[03:22.520 --> 03:25.800]  running all these operations you're putting al-Qaeda into Libya and they
[03:25.800 --> 03:31.480]  go so what we're taking your rights because of al-Qaeda I've got more news
[03:31.480 --> 03:35.360]  on that they it's in what Reuters that yeah okay al-Qaeda is taking over Libya
[03:35.360 --> 03:41.600]  and NATO warns they have to deal with them now you put al-Qaeda in to knock
[03:41.600 --> 03:45.800]  out Qaddafi and then you say oh my gosh now we got to have a war with al-Qaeda
[03:45.800 --> 03:52.280]  al-Qaeda's got Libya that's in Reuters today I mean the only reason the
[03:52.280 --> 03:56.840]  establishment is doing this is because they know the general public I was
[03:56.840 --> 04:01.520]  listening to Bloomberg radio this morning just about an hour ago driving
[04:01.520 --> 04:06.000]  into the office and I heard the host say oh I don't think the implosion of
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.040]  Europe's gonna hurt the US too much most Americans don't have a passport and most
[04:10.040 --> 04:14.360]  of those people can't even find Europe on a map and all the hosts were cackling

[05:10.440 --> 05:14.120]  directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs
[05:14.120 --> 05:18.480]  the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and
[05:18.480 --> 05:23.200]  viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[05:23.200 --> 05:28.240]  yourself produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver nano
[05:28.240 --> 05:32.560]  particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[05:32.560 --> 05:36.800]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[05:36.800 --> 05:41.560]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[05:41.560 --> 05:46.400]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go to

[07:07.240 --> 07:11.400]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[07:11.400 --> 07:15.440]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[07:15.440 --> 07:19.320]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[07:19.320 --> 07:23.600]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[07:23.600 --> 07:27.760]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[07:27.760 --> 07:32.060]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[07:32.060 --> 07:35.760]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[07:35.760 --> 07:39.960]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[07:39.960 --> 07:43.360]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[08:22.840 --> 08:28.840]  all right we have got a big broadcast lined up for you today on this Tuesday
[08:28.840 --> 08:35.560]  edition the 13th of September 2011 can you believe 2011 is getting long in the
[08:35.560 --> 08:40.600]  tooth and I'll be sitting here it'll feel like five minutes from now going
[08:40.600 --> 08:46.440]  we're approaching December 2012 when the government and the media and so many
[08:46.440 --> 08:51.080]  other institutions have been joining in on the fear-mongering that the world is
[08:51.080 --> 08:58.240]  going to end I am not one of those voices but you watch in 2013 if I'm
[08:58.240 --> 09:04.000]  still here that certainly is is in question but I believe the world will
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.760]  still be here but none of us know of will individually be here that's
[09:07.760 --> 09:11.720]  certainly in the cards that any of us could die in a car wreck you name it
[09:11.720 --> 09:17.600]  struck by a bolt of lightning whatever the case may be that after the 2012
[09:17.600 --> 09:22.880]  thing doesn't happen that there will be national media that will attack yours
[09:22.880 --> 09:29.560]  truly and say that I said 2012 would be the end of the world you watch and people
[09:29.560 --> 09:32.840]  will edit together what I've said over the years to make it sound like that I
[09:32.840 --> 09:38.480]  know that because it's been done before all right it is Tuesday ladies and
[09:38.480 --> 09:43.720]  gentlemen and we have super patriot demonized by 60 minutes and others the
[09:43.720 --> 09:51.040]  always informative and alternative to tyranny Alfred a desk he will be
[09:51.040 --> 09:59.240]  joining us coming up in T minus 51 minutes from now these are the type of
[09:59.240 --> 10:03.800]  news headlines I have today it's been confirmed that Merck paid off the
[10:03.800 --> 10:09.080]  California legislature to pass an attempted move to make Gardasil
[10:09.080 --> 10:14.140]  mandatory that itself is a hoax it's not mandatory they just say it is but
[10:14.140 --> 10:24.640]  business wire has the headline Sane Vax Inc. reports human papillomavirus HPV
[10:24.640 --> 10:35.920]  contamination in Gardasil to FDA request public safety investigation and I
[10:35.920 --> 10:41.440]  guess they mean that the RNA of the virus has gotten into the DNA so we're
[10:41.440 --> 10:45.720]  going to be going over this report and I want to get Mike Adams take on this as
[10:45.720 --> 10:49.080]  well but we've got some important Gardasil news coming up because now
[10:49.080 --> 10:53.720]  they're trying to run their regular hoax that it's the law all girls in America
[10:53.720 --> 10:58.360]  have to take it and it's the law that all boys have to take it and it's the law
[10:58.360 --> 11:02.920]  that all Mexican girls have to take it there is no law in Mexico you've got to
[11:02.920 --> 11:06.440]  take vaccines I've looked it up and there's no law in the United States you
[11:06.440 --> 11:11.640]  have to take vaccine but they keep hammering that lie every August before
[11:11.640 --> 11:17.680]  school starts you can tune into national radio national TV local radio it's in
[11:17.680 --> 11:22.240]  all the newscast a little PR announcement most of its paid that's a big dirty
[11:22.240 --> 11:26.000]  secret and talk radio a lot of local news is actually paid product placement
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.520]  propaganda placement that it's the law you've got to be vaccinated for school
[11:30.520 --> 11:35.400]  go to your local clinic they're having a mass vaccination today at Zilcher Park
[11:35.400 --> 11:42.120]  I remember hearing that a month ago or at these area sports stadiums it's the law
[11:42.120 --> 11:49.800]  don't get arrested a total criminal hoax and if you'll just go check it out
[11:49.800 --> 11:53.720]  for yourself and discover that I'm not lying to you and there's no law you have
[11:53.720 --> 11:58.600]  to take a vaccine and go into the school and let the school nurse lie to you first
[11:58.600 --> 12:05.200]  and say it is the law Mrs. Mrs. Jones Mrs. Johnson mr. mr. Brown mr.
[12:05.200 --> 12:11.080]  whatever the case is let them lie to you and then say a you've got a waiver
[12:11.080 --> 12:18.880]  you've got to give me by law in that filing cabinet and B there is no law
[12:18.880 --> 12:23.560]  I've got to even fill that out you just try to trick me if I wake up to another
[12:23.560 --> 12:28.640]  level of lies and get me to induce myself into a contract filed with the
[12:28.640 --> 12:32.400]  health department saying basically I'm a bad parent and there's a list of
[12:32.400 --> 12:37.800]  unvaccinated people it is your policy under the state health department that
[12:37.800 --> 12:42.080]  it's the policy that government would like you to have a shot but what you do
[12:42.080 --> 12:47.920]  is if I'm ignorant you will kick my child out of school under policy then
[12:47.920 --> 12:54.920]  invoke truancy laws and try to take my child from me and the hardcore criminal
[12:54.920 --> 12:59.960]  cult member behind that desk the principal or that or that nurse you will
[12:59.960 --> 13:04.760]  have that hardcore vicious criminal caught and you will have them in your
[13:04.760 --> 13:08.480]  sights and you will know how evil they are and you will experience the culture
[13:08.480 --> 13:14.200]  of evil let me tell you how evil works they find jellyfish creatures who will
[13:14.200 --> 13:19.240]  follow whatever orders they're given and that's how tyranny works that's how
[13:19.240 --> 13:23.320]  cops arrest people for things that aren't against the law every day in this
[13:23.320 --> 13:29.120]  country that's how judges instruct juries to convict people of things that
[13:29.120 --> 13:34.960]  aren't illegal and put it under some some other law that's how tyranny takes
[13:34.960 --> 13:39.760]  over a society now I have a video clip I'm going to play later when alfreda
[13:39.760 --> 13:45.960]  desk is on with us of a man peacefully on the street outside of the ground zero
[13:45.960 --> 13:52.040]  events they had streets shut down and a 9-11 truth or got through and I've seen
[13:52.040 --> 13:56.360]  countless reports from our sources and more videos are surfacing of people
[13:56.360 --> 14:00.520]  actually being arrested and then beat up I covered on the nightly news last night
[14:00.520 --> 14:04.440]  this individual I confirmed was not roughed up it was others that were
[14:04.440 --> 14:07.840]  arrested who were roughed up and we're working on getting in contact with them
[14:07.840 --> 14:12.800]  but Luke witness people being arrested for simply wearing 9-11 shirts and
[14:12.800 --> 14:17.440]  speaking out he witnessed people being turned back for investigate 9-11 or 9-11's
[14:17.440 --> 14:21.880]  an inside job or we are change shirts not from ground zero itself but from
[14:21.880 --> 14:25.720]  upwards of 10 blocks away they had checkpoints everywhere they shut the
[14:25.720 --> 14:30.760]  city down to one lane of traffic on all the major streets to keep people out so
[14:30.760 --> 14:35.040]  there couldn't be 9-11 truthers converging and killing the hoax there
[14:35.040 --> 14:39.360]  they wouldn't allow the firefighters the police the medical workers who survived
[14:39.360 --> 14:44.520]  and many of which were injured many of which are in wheelchairs into the event
[14:44.520 --> 14:49.800]  because in past years when we've shown the video survivors and others will
[14:49.800 --> 14:54.480]  speak out and say it's an inside job Giuliani you know it is it's never made
[14:54.480 --> 14:58.320]  it on national TV but it's made it when they're going up and down into the pit
[14:58.320 --> 15:02.560]  there in the bleachers seating and the system is very very scared there have
[15:02.560 --> 15:06.400]  been other 9-11 events in the lead-up last week and other cities where people
[15:06.400 --> 15:11.360]  did jump on stage and say 9-11's an inside job so the system is desperate
[15:11.360 --> 15:16.400]  they can't have their their their hoax fully implode because they need to stage
[15:16.400 --> 15:20.600]  more now and they're moving to their next phase to blame it on tea party
[15:20.600 --> 15:25.480]  conservatives libertarians and gun owners there they're now rolling out the
[15:25.480 --> 15:30.880]  PR just like I saw a PR roll out on bin Laden and I said they're gonna blow up
[15:30.880 --> 15:34.800]  the World Trade Center and blame it on bin Laden and I said that a year before I
[15:34.800 --> 15:37.640]  said it six months before but we have the tape of me saying it two months
[15:37.640 --> 15:44.840]  before when I said call the White House don't let them blow up the World Trade
[15:44.840 --> 15:49.960]  Center and blame it on a summer bin Laden their CIA asset because I saw the
[15:49.960 --> 15:56.720]  preconditioning the rollout there is now a total and complete rollout taking
[15:56.720 --> 16:03.760]  place as we speak to blame it on domestic groups and so I am begging all
[16:03.760 --> 16:08.440]  of you out there to realize that this is maker to break it to get this
[16:08.440 --> 16:12.880]  information out but I've now seen several videos in fact I forgot to get
[16:12.880 --> 16:17.000]  them to the crew news got them or they've it's now rolled off the front page of
[16:17.000 --> 16:22.880]  info wars.com it's now in the featured news archive there on info wars.com
[16:22.880 --> 16:29.400]  several of those videos but the first one is really crisp clean video I'd like
[16:29.400 --> 16:33.040]  to interview the person who was arrested and it's got him just saying we need to
[16:33.040 --> 16:37.440]  investigate this it was a crime scene I've got fliers here and there's other
[16:37.440 --> 16:40.120]  street people talking that's fine a guy runs up and screams says you're not
[16:40.120 --> 16:46.200]  wanted here and so the police then arrest him drag him off put him in handcuffs
[16:46.200 --> 16:49.720]  and put him in the car and I've got incredible reports and I'm told the
[16:49.720 --> 16:53.560]  videos being uploaded that other people were arrested as well and some of them
[16:53.560 --> 16:58.360]  you know slammed into the cars roughed up by police wouldn't be the first time
[16:58.360 --> 17:03.760]  I've been roughed up by New York police and of course I've also been roughed up
[17:03.760 --> 17:08.080]  by the Austin jail guards for no reason when I was arrested for demonstrating
[17:08.080 --> 17:13.680]  it's just part of the tyranny cowardly people get a job so they can slam your
[17:13.680 --> 17:18.000]  head into a wall and feel powerful only the ultimate coward would want to rough
[17:18.000 --> 17:22.680]  somebody up who had done nothing wrong except exercise the First Amendment and
[17:22.680 --> 17:29.680]  and slam your head into things now I could see if you arrested somebody who
[17:29.680 --> 17:35.000]  had three dead kids in a trunk in their house you'd want to beat the pulp out
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.800]  of them but you wouldn't do that because you want to make sure they got a nice
[17:38.800 --> 17:48.360]  fair trial before they got the lethal injection but cops getting off on beating
[17:48.360 --> 17:54.320]  up peaceful demonstrators it's wrong it is the essence of evil the essence of
[17:54.320 --> 18:01.600]  tyranny the essence of bullying the essence of anti-freedom the anti-America
[18:01.600 --> 18:06.360]  so that's coming up with Alfred Adasca as well but but I tell you when I first
[18:06.360 --> 18:11.600]  saw this footage yesterday Luca told me about it and I thought on and off air he
[18:11.600 --> 18:15.480]  told me a few stories and then I thought when we saw this video posted that that
[18:15.480 --> 18:18.560]  was the case he was talking about but no there's there's a whole bunch of these
[18:18.560 --> 18:24.000]  and all over the city no you're wearing a 9-11 shirt get go back but this isn't a
[18:24.000 --> 18:32.160]  controlled area I'm trying to get into lower Manhattan no and see next oh it's
[18:32.160 --> 18:37.520]  on your file you're a 9-11 truth or you can't get on an airplane you can't get a
[18:37.520 --> 18:43.440]  job the essence of tyranny again is about labeling people and restricting
[18:43.440 --> 18:46.840]  their rights and what is Rahm Emanuel and others said and now we've got
[18:46.840 --> 18:53.700]  evidence it's begun by stealth but we know it happened to vets Clinton did it
[18:53.700 --> 19:01.680]  to 80 something thousand right before he left office back in 2000 early 2001 it
[19:01.680 --> 19:06.640]  was 2000 it was a world that daily places reported on it you old vets go

[24:29.320 --> 24:34.320]  important news, but I want to take your phone calls and get into a ton of other news ahead
[24:34.320 --> 24:42.320]  of a guest joining us. The toll free number is 800-259-9231 and I want to give first time
[24:42.320 --> 24:47.320]  callers a chance to call in at least in the first and second hour. It'll be wide open
[24:47.320 --> 24:55.320]  phones in the third hour today. 800-259-9231. Here is what's coming up in the third hour
[24:55.320 --> 25:02.320]  today. The federal government has filed in Chicago in the big court case that's gotten
[25:02.320 --> 25:11.320]  attention in the Chicago Tribune and El Paso Times where it is admitted that the CIA and
[25:11.320 --> 25:20.320]  ATF gave authorization to the Sinaloa drug gang over five years to ship huge amounts,
[25:20.320 --> 25:26.320]  tons after tons of pure cocaine in the United States and they were shipping guns to them.
[25:26.320 --> 25:32.320]  Now this has always been going on, but this guy got busted by the Mexican government and
[25:32.320 --> 25:37.320]  then extradited to the United States and he claimed all of this and it began to come out
[25:37.320 --> 25:43.320]  in documents a few months ago. Now new documents in a motion filed Friday, September 9th, U.S.
[25:43.320 --> 25:48.320]  prosecutors did invoke national security and are saying yes it's true but we still want to
[25:48.320 --> 25:53.320]  send him to prison basically. This is big news. I'll be covering it with a special report
[25:53.320 --> 25:59.320]  tonight, 7 o'clock, Info Wars Nightly News at infowarsnews.com and of course,
[25:59.320 --> 26:05.320]  prisonplanet.tv. But I want to get more into this in the third hour today. See,
[26:05.320 --> 26:12.320]  Fast and Furious is not just guns into Mexico, it's guns into Honduras, it's guns into
[26:12.320 --> 26:19.320]  Nicaragua, El Salvador, it is guns into all of Latin America where cocaine is grown and
[26:19.320 --> 26:26.320]  where other drugs are imported and smuggled into the U.S. It is guns to gangs, as I told you,
[26:26.320 --> 26:29.320]  people were asking me how do you know it was being shipped into Chicago? We didn't see any
[26:29.320 --> 26:33.320]  articles about that. It was in the federal filings months ago. Now it was in mainstream
[26:33.320 --> 26:39.320]  news last week, guns into Indiana, into Chicago. All these reporters have got to do is go
[26:39.320 --> 26:44.320]  read and I'll just quickly at night, when I've got some time, pull up the latest filings
[26:44.320 --> 26:51.320]  that are posted on these different narco news sites with writers like Bill Conroy,
[26:51.320 --> 26:56.320]  I'm going to get on the show by the way, who are going over this, all this stuff is
[26:56.320 --> 27:03.320]  posted in public view on the federal websites and then reposted at the Narcosphere
[27:03.320 --> 27:08.320]  and other great websites out there. This is public. People always say,
[27:08.320 --> 27:12.320]  well, the government couldn't get away with drug dealing. They would get caught.
[27:12.320 --> 27:17.320]  They do get caught. It came on congressional hearings in the 70s that they, in thousands of
[27:17.320 --> 27:26.320]  dead troops, showed pure heroin into the inside of their bodies and would unzip them once
[27:26.320 --> 27:33.320]  they got here and take the goodies out. It's on record in the 1997 hearings in Congress
[27:33.320 --> 27:38.320]  that they admitted that, yeah, for a decade, the government ship cocaine into LA gave the crack
[27:38.320 --> 27:43.320]  cocaine formula to the crack dealers. I mean, I've interviewed Ricky Ross.
[27:43.320 --> 27:49.320]  He was making $30 million a day some days. He was just a regional dealer for the CIA.
[27:49.320 --> 27:54.320]  Gary Webb found out about it, wrote about it, won a Pulitzer Prize. They just went and killed him,
[27:54.320 --> 28:00.320]  shot him twice in the back of the head. The police came out and said, oh, that's normal.
[28:00.320 --> 28:04.320]  Even though Gary said people are breaking into my house, he had to move because of it.
[28:04.320 --> 28:09.320]  He caught guys, special forces types jumping off the roof and climbing down water drains.
[28:09.320 --> 28:14.320]  He described them like cats. He pulled up their special forces types coming down your deal
[28:14.320 --> 28:17.320]  that have broken in your house. You warn everybody, hey, I'm getting threats.
[28:17.320 --> 28:24.320]  They kill you. And it's like, oh, no, nothing happened to him. This is how this stuff works.
[28:24.320 --> 28:28.320]  And they get you in the army. And if you're a good guy, you end up in supply or you end up
[28:28.320 --> 28:35.320]  guarding roads somewhere. But if you play ball, you end up being a millionaire government
[28:35.320 --> 28:43.320]  murder technician or drug dealer pilot. That's how all this works.
[28:43.320 --> 28:51.320]  I mean, I grew up with family who'd been army officers who would talk about this stuff.
[28:51.320 --> 28:57.320]  And by the way, my family's not special. It's like saying I grew up with family that drove 18-wheelers.
[28:57.320 --> 29:02.320]  This is a giant $500 billion year industry. Your local crackhead is not running it.
[29:02.320 --> 29:08.320]  The big megabanks that run this country run the drugs. They made them illegal in the 30s
[29:08.320 --> 29:12.320]  so they could jack up the price and send hit teams to kill their competition.
[29:12.320 --> 29:17.320]  I said I'd cover it in the third hour. It's time to stop being naive.
[29:17.320 --> 29:24.320]  I'm risking my life to bring you this information because they're using this stuff to destroy our country.
[29:24.320 --> 29:30.320]  And they also control the terrorist. The same narco terrorist banks control the terrorist
[29:30.320 --> 29:35.320]  and use them to attack the public or to take the blame for attacks on the public
[29:35.320 --> 29:39.320]  to set up a police state over you and your family.
[29:39.320 --> 29:42.320]  I want to warn police and military that have gone along with this evil.
[29:42.320 --> 29:47.320]  You cannot make a deal with this level of evil. You've got to choose a side.
[29:47.320 --> 29:56.320]  Are we going to come back with the economy? We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.320 --> 30:05.320]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here. You all know I've worked for years with Steve Shank and Eat Food Direct.

[30:11.320 --> 30:17.320]  It's very different. People are using this great food to survive the present hurricane season.
[30:17.320 --> 30:22.320]  And we've already had $40 billion worth of damage from floods, storms, quakes and droughts.
[30:22.320 --> 30:25.320]  And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[30:25.320 --> 30:29.320]  Natural disasters are newsworthy, but only touch a few of us Americans.
[30:29.320 --> 30:33.320]  The huge issue of the Great Depression is on everyone's mind.
[30:33.320 --> 30:39.320]  The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses and skyrocketing food costs are hitting every American.
[30:39.320 --> 30:44.320]  It's a huge issue of food security. Folks, this month you will get free shipping on every food order from Eat Foods Direct.
[30:44.320 --> 30:47.320]  That's right, every order gets free shipping starting September 6th.

[32:09.320 --> 32:11.320]  It really says that the state is God.
[32:11.320 --> 32:17.320]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on earth.
[32:17.320 --> 32:23.320]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA cares, now being expanded nationwide.
[32:23.320 --> 32:29.320]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[32:29.320 --> 32:33.320]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.

[33:28.320 --> 33:32.320]  He always wore his Sunday feathers and held the Tommy Hall.
[33:32.320 --> 33:41.320]  The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk collider.
[33:41.320 --> 33:50.320]  Disturbing to ever show a sign, because his heart was made of naughty pie.
[33:50.320 --> 33:54.320]  Poor collider, he never got a kiss.
[33:54.320 --> 33:59.320]  Poor collider, he don't know how to miss.

[34:42.320 --> 34:50.320]  First off, I want to tell you about Harvesteating.com, a great sponsor, Harvesteating.com.
[34:50.320 --> 34:56.320]  Celebrity chef Keith Snow started a site that teaches how to use and prepare local foods.
[34:56.320 --> 35:02.320]  This site is designed to educate patriots and make them aware of real healthy food right in their own community.
[35:02.320 --> 35:06.320]  That's Harvesteating.com.
[35:06.320 --> 35:09.320]  That's Harvesteating.com.
[35:09.320 --> 35:15.320]  There are tools and resources on how to get local foods, recipes and videos to get you started.

[35:26.320 --> 35:30.320]  Continuing here, I want to tell you about a Made in America high quality clothing company.
[35:30.320 --> 35:38.320]  They've got shirts, they've got motorcycle jeans, regular Levi style jeans, all specially designed to last a lot longer.

[35:49.320 --> 35:56.320]  So check it out at GussetClothing.com and use the promo code Alex for this special.
[35:56.320 --> 36:03.320]  A little plug here says, through Labor Day, so I guess they're just extending that on out.
[36:03.320 --> 36:07.320]  Again, that's GussetClothing.com.
[36:07.320 --> 36:11.320]  Check it out today and it is the sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[36:11.320 --> 36:17.320]  It is those of you out there who have PrisonPlanet.tv memberships.
[36:17.320 --> 36:21.320]  You notice we've added the special reports section.
[36:21.320 --> 36:27.320]  We've added the live nightly news, 7 o'clock every evening.
[36:27.320 --> 36:29.320]  It's live some nights, some nights it's taped.
[36:29.320 --> 36:39.320]  We have added the Rants section and we're adding a whole bunch of other sections and systems and we're listing your feedback and adding what you ask for if we can, to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[36:39.320 --> 36:41.320]  15 cents a day, $5.95 a month.
[36:41.320 --> 36:44.320]  We're getting early membership and get three months free.
[36:44.320 --> 36:51.320]  You are truly supporting hardcore alternative media that is the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.
[36:51.320 --> 36:56.320]  We're risking our names, our treasure, our families, our bodies in this fight.
[36:56.320 --> 36:59.320]  Please join us in the Info War today.
[36:59.320 --> 37:02.320]  PrisonPlanet.tv and join us every night, 7 o'clock.
[37:02.320 --> 37:05.320]  Record the show, upload it to your friends and family.
[37:05.320 --> 37:07.320]  Save it, we're going to be adding.
[37:07.320 --> 37:13.320]  There's easy ways to download it and save it right now, but we're going to make it even easier and more functions, more ways to do it.
[37:13.320 --> 37:15.320]  Share it with people.
[37:15.320 --> 37:23.320]  PrisonPlanet.tv, I should add in closing, six people can log in with the same username and passcode simultaneously.
[37:23.320 --> 37:32.320]  Obviously though, don't create a username and passcode that you've got for your own personal stuff that you're going to give friends and family.
[37:32.320 --> 37:34.320]  Create a new one.
[37:34.320 --> 37:38.320]  If you're already a PrisonPlanet.tv member, there's an easy way, just click there on the live stream.
[37:38.320 --> 37:45.320]  It says change your passcode here to something simple and then send it to a few friends and family and tell them you can't share this.
[37:45.320 --> 37:55.320]  Obviously, or then too many people will log in with the passcode and then sometimes if more than six try to log on, it'll block you out for that period.
[37:55.320 --> 38:05.320]  And again, we'd have it where it was all free, but I've got to finance reporters, cameras, the rent, the bandwidth, the equipment, everything.
[38:05.320 --> 38:13.320]  And we are gearing up as promised and really sacrificing time and energy, but I don't need to be thanked for that.
[38:13.320 --> 38:18.320]  What do you expect me to do?
[38:18.320 --> 38:20.320]  I mean, I have always looked for other leaders.
[38:20.320 --> 38:22.320]  I just want to be a soldier.
[38:22.320 --> 38:25.320]  I want to be a captain in this fight, but not a general.
[38:25.320 --> 38:29.320]  In fact, five, six years ago, I liked only having four or five people working with me.
[38:29.320 --> 38:31.320]  I like being small.
[38:31.320 --> 38:36.320]  I wanted to just, you know, grow and put ideas out there.
[38:36.320 --> 38:42.320]  But then I realized people were demanding that we grow, demanding we do more, demanding I'd be more of a leader.
[38:42.320 --> 39:00.320]  And then through attacks and other things that have happened over the years, I realized instead of just, in a way, it was subconscious fear, fear of responsibility, fear of not wanting to be in a leadership position,
[39:00.320 --> 39:04.320]  fear of if I get too big, they'll come after me.
[39:04.320 --> 39:13.320]  I've been under the radar so far and I had to consciously scan that fear in my brain and then eradicate it and fully commit.
[39:13.320 --> 39:16.320]  That means I don't get to bounce my little daughter on my knee as much.
[39:16.320 --> 39:20.320]  That means I don't get to go fishing, but a couple of times a year, never get to go hunting.
[39:20.320 --> 39:22.320]  That means I don't get to go to national parks like I like to.
[39:22.320 --> 39:25.320]  That means I've got to be up here till midnight many nights.
[39:25.320 --> 39:34.320]  That means I've got to be working seven days a week, but you know what, we're in an absolute crisis and a war and there is no future for my children if I don't do this.
[39:34.320 --> 39:36.320]  And so that's why I've committed.
[39:36.320 --> 39:38.320]  We're not some big corporation, ladies and gentlemen.
[39:38.320 --> 39:42.320]  We're 34 or 35 souls here and growing.
[39:42.320 --> 39:45.320]  We've been able to do this because you have supported us.
[39:45.320 --> 39:46.320]  So go to infowars.com.
[39:46.320 --> 39:51.320]  Buy the high quality stainless steel water filter bottles that do 100 gallons of even swamp water.
[39:51.320 --> 40:14.320]  Buy the Ron Paul t-shirts, buy the camouflage infowars.com hats, buy the books, buy the videos, do it today and know that you are super charging our operation and allowing us to be strong and robust in the face of the globalist, allowing us to continue to build and have moderate reserves.
[40:14.320 --> 40:18.320]  So we can continue to operate even if a full total collapse comes in.
[40:18.320 --> 40:21.320]  We are doing our best.
[40:21.320 --> 40:22.320]  We are doing our best.
[40:22.320 --> 40:24.320]  I'm even trying to put an emergency communication systems.
[40:24.320 --> 40:35.320]  I'm even trying to build out a mobile info wars Falcon RV so we could send people out on the ground.
[40:35.320 --> 40:38.320]  And I know the TSA shutting down air travel.
[40:38.320 --> 40:42.320]  Now they're going to be shutting down with checkpoints on the ground, arresting you when you come through key areas.
[40:42.320 --> 40:44.320]  It's already begun in New York as a beta test.
[40:44.320 --> 40:48.320]  But as the lockdown happens, I've said I'm going down with the ship.
[40:48.320 --> 40:50.320]  I'm going down with the ship.
[40:50.320 --> 40:54.320]  I believe that the fight is still viable and we can win this thing.
[40:54.320 --> 41:01.320]  There's an article out today that Ron Paul has doubled his support in an index of polls in just the last two weeks.
[41:01.320 --> 41:04.320]  He's doubled his support.
[41:04.320 --> 41:06.320]  He is a top tier candidate.
[41:06.320 --> 41:10.320]  If they weren't saying he couldn't win, he'd be number one undisputed right now.
[41:10.320 --> 41:12.320]  He's a major contender.
[41:12.320 --> 41:14.320]  I could have been a contender.
[41:14.320 --> 41:17.320]  Well, he is a contender.
[41:17.320 --> 41:19.320]  A major contender.
[41:19.320 --> 41:24.320]  But if you get into a fight and don't believe you can't win, you're going to lose.
[41:24.320 --> 41:29.320]  The key to a fight is knowing you've got the initiative and not thinking about who's going to win.
[41:29.320 --> 41:30.320]  Start swinging.
[41:30.320 --> 41:32.320]  That's who wins the fight.
[41:32.320 --> 41:34.320]  The person that doesn't think about winning the fight.
[41:34.320 --> 41:37.320]  The person that thinks about stomping time.
[41:37.320 --> 41:38.320]  That's what happens.
[41:38.320 --> 41:39.320]  It's about turning it loose.
[41:39.320 --> 41:41.320]  It's about opening up a can.
[41:41.320 --> 41:43.320]  And you know what I'm talking about out there?
[41:43.320 --> 41:46.320]  It's about committing, and that's the end of it.
[41:46.320 --> 41:49.320]  Whatever's happening, it's clobbering time.
[41:49.320 --> 41:54.320]  And if they end up stealing the election, it's like, oh, the Cohen tell pros like, well, you say there's election fraud.
[41:54.320 --> 41:55.320]  Why would you promote it?
[41:55.320 --> 41:58.320]  Because we'll prove election fraud by showing it.
[41:58.320 --> 42:01.320]  You don't prove where the enemy is without engaging them.
[42:01.320 --> 42:03.320]  You don't get stronger without fighting them.
[42:03.320 --> 42:06.320]  You don't put ideas out when you say, oh, it's rigged.
[42:06.320 --> 42:07.320]  I'm not taking the field.
[42:07.320 --> 42:12.320]  Let them put him in there with one man against three other gladiators.
[42:12.320 --> 42:16.320]  If they destroy him, it'll be an example to others.
[42:16.320 --> 42:18.320]  Not of cowardice, but of strength.
[42:18.320 --> 42:23.320]  The truth is people don't cower when they see a martyr politically destroyed.
[42:23.320 --> 42:25.320]  They get angry.
[42:25.320 --> 42:27.320]  Somehow they've got a mind trick going down.
[42:27.320 --> 42:31.320]  Everybody's scared of fake terrorism and cowering under their tables from something statistically.
[42:31.320 --> 42:35.320]  You know, that's extremely rare.
[42:35.320 --> 42:37.320]  But shark bites extremely rare.
[42:37.320 --> 42:41.320]  Most people won't go into the water past their necks at the beach because they're scared.
[42:41.320 --> 42:45.320]  There might be five shark deaths a year globally on average.
[42:45.320 --> 42:47.320]  Pull it up.
[42:47.320 --> 42:48.320]  Some years there's three.
[42:48.320 --> 42:50.320]  There's been as many as 12.
[42:50.320 --> 42:52.320]  So what, a shark bites your foot.
[42:52.320 --> 42:53.320]  Sometimes that happens.
[42:53.320 --> 42:55.320]  That happens to hundreds of people.
[42:55.320 --> 42:56.320]  Whoopty-doo.
[42:56.320 --> 42:58.320]  Whoopty-doo.
[42:58.320 --> 43:01.320]  But you won't even go in the water because of the shark.
[43:01.320 --> 43:04.320]  And a lot of you won't even get politically involved because you know there's a tyranny.
[43:04.320 --> 43:08.320]  And that's the point I was thinking about this morning that I've talked about before, but not enough.
[43:08.320 --> 43:09.320]  And I'm going to say this.
[43:09.320 --> 43:13.320]  Mention a few news items that are coming up and then go to your calls.
[43:13.320 --> 43:24.320]  When the globalist staged 9-11, they did it in a very transparent way where governments, intelligence agencies, and corporations would know that it was an inside job.
[43:24.320 --> 43:28.320]  So for the general public, it's a dumbing down acceptance of the police state.
[43:28.320 --> 43:41.320]  For scientists and academics and others, they know what's going on.
[43:41.320 --> 43:43.320]  And so it was a message to the world.
[43:43.320 --> 43:50.320]  Yes, there's been a hard coup in America by the ruthless military industrial complex controlled by the big megabanks.
[43:50.320 --> 43:52.320]  Yes, this has happened.
[43:52.320 --> 43:56.320]  And the whole world better do what we say.
[43:56.320 --> 44:02.320]  And you notice Russia, China, everybody just rolled over and started groveling, going, wow, you just did that.
[44:02.320 --> 44:03.320]  You are bold.
[44:03.320 --> 44:09.320]  You think you're going to get away with blowing up all those towers and all of that and say, guys, in a cave did it?
[44:09.320 --> 44:11.320]  I mean, it's scared the rest of the world.
[44:11.320 --> 44:24.320]  The arrogance, the bravada, the hubris, the hutzpah, the aplomb, whatever term you want to use to describe it, the recklessness, the crazed nature.
[44:24.320 --> 44:28.320]  See, there were dual messages there, the globalist or masters of that.
[44:28.320 --> 44:36.320]  And that's why there's these threats put out by CFR members like Hart that say we stage terror attacks, Iran, do what we say.
[44:36.320 --> 44:44.320]  I mean, put a public letter out saying we stage Gulf of Tonkin, we stage the USS, you know, the sinking of the Maine.
[44:44.320 --> 44:48.320]  Don't play games with us.
[44:48.320 --> 44:53.320]  Cheney, give us a bigger defense budget or nukes will to kill you.
[44:53.320 --> 44:54.320]  Rums fell this weekend.
[44:54.320 --> 44:57.320]  Don't cut the defense budget or Al Qaeda will hit you.
[44:57.320 --> 45:00.320]  Don't try to abolish the Federal Reserve or the Anti-Federal Reserve.
[45:00.320 --> 45:02.320]  People are going to blow up federal buildings.
[45:02.320 --> 45:03.320]  We're going to have to arrest all of you.
[45:03.320 --> 45:06.320]  It is 100% in your face.
[45:06.320 --> 45:07.320]  And they even say it on TV.
[45:07.320 --> 45:12.320]  It's like a gangster going, you do what I say or I'm going to kill your whole family.
[45:12.320 --> 45:17.320]  You understand me and you know I mean it.
[45:17.320 --> 45:20.320]  They're communicating to people that are thinkers.
[45:20.320 --> 45:23.320]  Now, they think you're going to roll over.
[45:23.320 --> 45:25.320]  At a certain point, you just got to go, I'm done.
[45:25.320 --> 45:27.320]  Do whatever you're going to do.
[45:27.320 --> 45:30.320]  I'm coming after you.
[45:30.320 --> 45:33.320]  Because these people are going to wreck our society, wreck our world.
[45:33.320 --> 45:35.320]  I'm not worried about Alex Jones.
[45:35.320 --> 45:38.320]  This type of arrogant gangsterism.
[45:38.320 --> 45:40.320]  At the end of the day, I'm not even worried about my own family.
[45:40.320 --> 45:43.320]  You have to commit to this or they've got that power over you.
[45:43.320 --> 45:48.320]  You've got to fully all in and say basically consider yourself and your whole family is already going.
[45:48.320 --> 45:51.320]  That's the only way you get any type of protection.
[45:51.320 --> 45:54.320]  And it's not just protection from the globalist knowing you're committed.
[45:54.320 --> 45:57.320]  That you care about your family so much you're willing to lose them.
[45:57.320 --> 46:00.320]  Because the human family is going to be lost if we don't.
[46:00.320 --> 46:04.320]  These reckless globalists and their attitude will destroy us.
[46:04.320 --> 46:07.320]  They're insane delusions of grandeur.
[46:07.320 --> 46:12.320]  They're delusional mania.
[46:12.320 --> 46:15.320]  They're feelings of invincibility.
[46:15.320 --> 46:19.320]  The same reason Hitler turned into Russia, into the winner.
[46:19.320 --> 46:23.320]  Same reason other dictators have done it.
[46:23.320 --> 46:25.320]  Napoleon Bonaparte.
[46:25.320 --> 46:27.320]  They always think they're invincible.
[46:27.320 --> 46:31.320]  Because everything they do to a certain point, as it gets bolder and bolder,
[46:31.320 --> 46:37.320]  society goes through a first part where people are so, so buffaloed by it.
[46:37.320 --> 46:40.320]  So, so, so bushwhacked.
[46:40.320 --> 46:47.320]  So Shanghai, psychically, so cowed that people go into shock.
[46:47.320 --> 46:52.320]  But as the tyranny gets worse and worse, instincts to survive.
[46:52.320 --> 46:55.320]  Instincts for the species.
[46:55.320 --> 46:57.320]  Species survival kicks in.
[46:57.320 --> 46:58.320]  Not individual survival.
[46:58.320 --> 47:00.320]  There's different types of instincts.
[47:00.320 --> 47:03.320]  There's a much deeper societal survival instinct.
[47:03.320 --> 47:08.320]  That's how men can charge machine gun nest, watching their compatriots being blown to beds.
[47:08.320 --> 47:14.320]  Still, well, you know, if we don't, they've been, you know, told this army's going to come take our land
[47:14.320 --> 47:17.320]  and take over our way of life and enslave our women.
[47:17.320 --> 47:19.320]  It's that ancient thing.
[47:19.320 --> 47:21.320]  So the men just, all right, it's time to die.
[47:21.320 --> 47:23.320]  Let's go.
[47:23.320 --> 47:27.320]  That is a false societal instinct for survival.
[47:27.320 --> 47:32.320]  The globalists are experts at that, directing that instinct so you give in to tyranny.
[47:32.320 --> 47:37.320]  You've got to really get the lay of the land intellectually.
[47:37.320 --> 47:42.320]  And then you've got to make the decision on whether you want humanity to survive
[47:42.320 --> 47:47.320]  because there's no doubt in my mind, my deep historical understanding to know
[47:47.320 --> 47:51.320]  the globalists are going to end up destroying us or almost destroying us
[47:51.320 --> 47:59.320]  in cataclysmic bio weapon wars, bio releases, super energy weapons,
[47:59.320 --> 48:03.320]  all sorts of things they've developed that could easily destroy us.
[48:03.320 --> 48:11.320]  And so I'm not going to be insanely selfish because I know that's an illusion.
[48:11.320 --> 48:18.320]  I'm not going to use my talents to join the dark side and get some petty short term temporal power
[48:18.320 --> 48:23.320]  for myself individually at the expense of my entire future genetic line
[48:23.320 --> 48:25.320]  and what humans are going to become.
[48:25.320 --> 48:27.320]  I am in love with future humans.
[48:27.320 --> 48:32.320]  I am in love with our technological developments in our beauty and our art.
[48:32.320 --> 48:38.320]  I am in love with the projections of what I can't even begin to imagine.
[48:38.320 --> 48:41.320]  The eye has not seen, the ear has not heard what God has in store for us
[48:41.320 --> 48:47.320]  if the species makes it out of this and really takes our destiny on.
[48:47.320 --> 48:54.320]  So I am rocket fuel and so are you to get this species to a type one civilization.
[48:54.320 --> 48:59.320]  That means off world able to survive as a species even if the planet is destroyed.
[48:59.320 --> 49:05.320]  It is a prime directive in all life to procreate and survive and push the species forward.
[49:05.320 --> 49:09.320]  And so it is not courage, it is not honor, it is none of those.
[49:09.320 --> 49:11.320]  Those are just names we have for it.
[49:11.320 --> 49:19.320]  It is basic humanity, basic survival of the genetics and that's why I'm so angry at the globalist.
[49:19.320 --> 49:22.320]  They are running around splicing every life form they can,
[49:22.320 --> 49:31.320]  irrevocably creating horrible creatures acting like their God and doing a terrible job in their attempt to become like God's.
[49:31.320 --> 49:36.320]  And really screwing up this planet that we don't even know where it came from.
[49:36.320 --> 49:40.320]  Or exactly what the larger, I mean we are on a planet folks.
[49:40.320 --> 49:43.320]  I know God's there, I'm saying we don't know how God did it.
[49:43.320 --> 49:45.320]  We can't even begin to imagine what God is.
[49:45.320 --> 49:47.320]  It is such a huge thing.
[49:47.320 --> 49:52.320]  And I mean folks have you looked out at the stars at night?
[49:52.320 --> 49:53.320]  I know I say this, words can't describe it.
[49:53.320 --> 50:02.320]  I mean it was a champagne moon came up last night with giant red sunset like a crown around the horizon.
[50:02.320 --> 50:09.320]  And this morning a champagne moon came back up out of the A's and little birds flapping around in the trees and the cool wind.
[50:09.320 --> 50:16.320]  I mean it's just like my God, the evidence of God is all around us.
[50:16.320 --> 50:20.320]  And we've got a bunch of mad scientists creating glow-in-the-dark cats.
[50:20.320 --> 50:26.320]  That's back on the news today and glow-in-the-dark monkeys and injecting insect genes in every mammal you can imagine.
[50:26.320 --> 50:31.320]  And it's already giving rise to mutated viruses and causing all sorts of problems.
[50:31.320 --> 50:35.320]  So of course I've got to get up here and not be afraid and speak out.
[50:35.320 --> 50:38.320]  Even though they can politically destroy me or send a hit team to get me.
[50:38.320 --> 50:41.320]  I want to ask the hit teams and I want to ask the bureaucrats,
[50:41.320 --> 50:46.320]  what is, you're selling out for a bunch of paper that megabanks issue?
[50:46.320 --> 50:49.320]  You'd sell your mommy out for a suitcase of paper?
[50:49.320 --> 50:55.320]  When you can walk outside and stare into eternity and the universe and God all around you?
[50:55.320 --> 51:01.320]  And you're ready to sell out? Sell out to what? It's the biggest joke I've ever seen.
[51:01.320 --> 51:06.320]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[51:06.320 --> 51:12.320]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[51:12.320 --> 51:17.320]  Number one, study the past. History really does repeat itself.
[51:17.320 --> 51:22.320]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[51:22.320 --> 51:25.320]  Number three, take decisive action.
[51:25.320 --> 51:29.320]  A perfect storm is brewing or a global food crisis.
[51:29.320 --> 51:34.320]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices Empty Shelves.
[51:34.320 --> 51:38.320]  It's warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[51:38.320 --> 51:42.320]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[51:42.320 --> 51:46.320]  This book is only available at RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com.
[51:46.320 --> 51:51.320]  You'll also get a free copy of supermarket survival, how to cut your grocery bills in half.
[51:51.320 --> 51:56.320]  Again, that website is RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com.
[51:56.320 --> 52:00.320]  That's RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com.
[52:00.320 --> 52:07.320]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones. My shelf, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families
[52:07.320 --> 52:12.320]  that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front.
[52:12.320 --> 52:16.320]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[52:16.320 --> 52:20.320]  But we can't do that without your help by getting the films,
[52:20.320 --> 52:30.320]  bumper stickers and t-shirts at InfoWars.com. You will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[52:30.320 --> 52:34.320]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[52:34.320 --> 52:40.320]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[52:40.320 --> 52:50.320]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[52:50.320 --> 52:59.320]  The war is here. It's an Info War. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[52:59.320 --> 53:07.320]  What would you do with a check for $25,000? What if you could eliminate all of your credit card debt in 90 days and keep all of your money?
[53:07.320 --> 53:11.320]  Hi, I'm Jason Davenport and I've just completed Zero Debt 100.com,
[53:11.320 --> 53:18.320]  a program that stops and prevents debt collections of all kinds including debt collectors and foreclosures with guaranteed results.
[53:18.320 --> 53:25.320]  Forget loan modifications. Zero Debt showed me how to get the banks to pay my property taxes and insurance while stopping my foreclosure without paying one dime.
[53:25.320 --> 53:31.320]  An attorney tried to garnish my wages but the court denied his request because of what I filed from the Zero Debt program.
[53:31.320 --> 53:37.320]  Find out how I did this by calling Zero Debt today at 800-477-9256.
[53:37.320 --> 53:44.320]  Tell them Jason sent you and ask for the Zero Debt special and the free bonus promotion about stopping an IRS levy and getting your money back.
[53:44.320 --> 53:49.320]  Tell them Jason sent you and call 800-477-9256.
[53:49.320 --> 53:52.320]  800-477-9256.
[53:52.320 --> 54:02.320]  Call 800-477-9256 or visit www.zerodet100.com.
[54:22.320 --> 54:35.320]  Okay, we are back live, ladies and gentlemen. We are alive in a planet of beauty and wonderment and creativity and blessings that just run over.
[54:35.320 --> 54:40.320]  But the Madison Avenue system teaches the public to feel empty and pathetic.
[54:40.320 --> 54:43.320]  People who say life is empty?
[54:43.320 --> 54:47.320]  Well, they're television watchers. They're sports fans. They're empty.
[54:47.320 --> 54:54.320]  They want to feed their bestial, low-level brutishness and that will never fulfill you.
[54:54.320 --> 54:57.320]  Facing down evil will fulfill you.
[54:57.320 --> 54:59.320]  It'll take on a lot of different roads.
[54:59.320 --> 55:05.320]  But facing reality, that is where enlightenment, that is where fulfillment comes from.
[55:05.320 --> 55:09.320]  And my goal is to be real and to be true.
[55:09.320 --> 55:13.320]  True to oneself, true to my family, true to my culture.
[55:13.320 --> 55:16.320]  I guess they call that being honorable.
[55:16.320 --> 55:21.320]  I see a man in my word. I make mistakes. I'm not perfect. My flesh is strong.
[55:21.320 --> 55:24.320]  But we can defeat this evil.
[55:24.320 --> 55:35.320]  And we're going to defeat it by reaching out to the enforcers, the bureaucrats, the technicians of the system and really asking them, do you like the way things are going?
[55:35.320 --> 55:38.320]  Do you think a culture of lies is sustainable?
[55:38.320 --> 55:41.320]  Is this what you want for your children?
[55:41.320 --> 55:46.320]  Because when you talk about your children, when you die, you join your fathers. You join your mothers.
[55:46.320 --> 55:50.320]  You join them in eternity. It's a great fraternity.
[55:50.320 --> 55:52.320]  A fraternity of eternity.
[55:52.320 --> 55:58.320]  But there's also that eternity of the future species.
[55:58.320 --> 56:02.320]  And that fraternity you have in that eternity.
[56:02.320 --> 56:04.320]  And it's a wonderful thing.
[56:04.320 --> 56:11.320]  It's the greatest human attribute to pour yourself in for the betterment of society.
[56:11.320 --> 56:14.320]  The globalists are all about the wrecking of society.
[56:14.320 --> 56:17.320]  They're the polar opposite of what good is.
[56:17.320 --> 56:19.320]  They come to kill, steal and destroy.
[56:19.320 --> 56:22.320]  I know we got Steve, Michael, Micah, Matt, Bob and others.
[56:22.320 --> 56:24.320]  I just get on a roll here.
[56:24.320 --> 56:29.320]  NATO training to open an Indiana Guard base, 700 troops to train there.
[56:29.320 --> 56:34.320]  The problem is that this just acclimates everybody and they do have deals to use foreign troops in America.
[56:34.320 --> 56:36.320]  And more and more we're just being conditioned air force times.
[56:36.320 --> 56:39.320]  You know the U.S. embassies under attack and cobble.
[56:39.320 --> 56:42.320]  This is what a real terror attack looks like.
[56:42.320 --> 56:45.320]  The West has been there 10 years. They want them out.
[56:45.320 --> 56:49.320]  And it is about opium. There's tribes that want the full smack money for themselves.
[56:49.320 --> 56:51.320]  So that's just an opium war.
[56:51.320 --> 56:56.320]  You just decriminalize it and they'll start growing vegetables again.
[56:56.320 --> 57:03.320]  We got that coming up. I got huge economic news, huge Ron Paul news, just insane amounts of key news.
[57:03.320 --> 57:05.320]  But let's start going to calls.
[57:05.320 --> 57:09.320]  Let's go to Bob in California. You're on the air. Go ahead, Bob.
[57:09.320 --> 57:11.320]  Hey, Alex. How are you?
[57:11.320 --> 57:13.320]  Good.
[57:13.320 --> 57:18.320]  I'm a first-time caller, prison, planet subscriber, member of We Are Change LA.
[57:18.320 --> 57:20.320]  We Are Change Hollywood.
[57:20.320 --> 57:26.320]  Every month we do an outreach where we give out DVDs, primarily about 9-1-1.
[57:26.320 --> 57:35.320]  And over the last three years or so, we get a lot of support from when we do it over the freeway,
[57:35.320 --> 57:40.320]  we get a lot of trucks honking at us and waving and giving us support.
[57:40.320 --> 57:47.320]  We had an outreach on Sunday at Santa Monica Pier and Third Street Promenade.
[57:47.320 --> 57:53.320]  And boy, I'll tell you that mainstream media, really, the propaganda over the last week.
[57:53.320 --> 57:56.320]  We have a lot of people arguing with us.
[57:56.320 --> 58:00.320]  Yeah, no, no, they're trying. I've never seen such a push since 9-11.
[58:00.320 --> 58:07.320]  They're trying to reinvoke that fear and get people to believe it's real so they can bring the toy back out.
[58:07.320 --> 58:12.320]  They want to run that play of stage terror so bad they can taste it.
[58:12.320 --> 58:14.320]  And so, yes, they're trying to reinvoke it.
[58:14.320 --> 58:18.320]  There's a big pushback, a big sigh-up.
[58:18.320 --> 58:23.320]  Well, the hardest thing is, for me, I mean, I'm ostracized from my family.
[58:23.320 --> 58:25.320]  It's really hard.
[58:25.320 --> 58:30.320]  You know, it's hard even in the workplace to, you know, not get carried away with this
[58:30.320 --> 58:32.320]  because the truth keeps marching on.
[58:32.320 --> 58:36.320]  Well, I think with people when you're arguing with them, make it more fun.
[58:36.320 --> 58:38.320]  Say, hey, look at Building 7 for me.
[58:38.320 --> 58:47.320]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[59:08.320 --> 59:36.320]  We turned jeans inside out, Diamond Gusset Jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[59:36.320 --> 59:42.320]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset Comfort with Kevlar Protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[59:42.320 --> 59:45.320]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[59:45.320 --> 01:00:07.320]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it. Others don't.
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:22.320]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:33.320]  Alright, we're into hour number two. Let's continue with your phone calls.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.320]  Launching news coming up. I'm going to go over some of the news with Alfred Adask.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:41.320]  Matt in Florida, thanks for holding. Welcome.
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.320]  Mr. Jones.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.320]  Hey, buddy.
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.320]  Hey, sir, thanks for taking my call.
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:52.320]  I was at the Tampa Debate last night, and I wasn't in the main room, but I was in the Watch Debate party, which was next door.
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:58.320]  And there was a lot of Ron Paul support there, and Rick Perry had a lot of guys there, too.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:03.320]  And afterwards, everybody waited for the candidates, and they came up to our side to speak.
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:10.320]  And Dr. Paul didn't show up, but Rick Perry came out, and it was like a total rock star.
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:15.320]  It was Blair and rock music and big smile and high fiving.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:19.320]  And, you know, it's kind of everything you'd expect from a male cheerleader.
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:25.320]  Yeah, it's about making people feel like they're winners and that they're betting on the guy that's handsome.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:30.320]  If people want another Kindle like Obama, then they get what they deserve.
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:36.320]  And if people like forced inoculations and handing roads over to foreign corporations and Bilderberg attending.
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:43.320]  And what's worse about Perry is I've now learned from a person I really trust have known for many years.
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:52.320]  I've known for about 18 years of a prominent individual here in Austin that Rick Perry was anti-New World Order in 1998 and gave him literature about it.
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:55.320]  I mean, Rick Perry knows all about this stuff.
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:59.320]  He's not just some puppet. That is disgusting.
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:08.320]  And the local media was there and they were doing interviews and they gave me an interview and I laid it down pretty hard on Rick Perry.
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:14.320]  And just what you just said about NAFTA and the guard of Phil and being Al Gore is the best, hardest worker.
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:18.320]  And Hillary Lover, I mean, it's hard to get it all out there so much.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:23.320]  Yes, sir, but the best part is, you know, and then she asked me who I was there and I told her I was there to see Dr. Paul.
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:29.320]  And then she said, okay, I didn't get a bite. Let's start from the top. And I just said, you know, no, thank you.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:36.320]  Because I don't want to be spliced and to, you know, make me look like an idiot because I'm a Dr. Paul supporter.
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:39.320]  Well, you don't know what she was calculating.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:47.320]  I mean, if it's local media, a lot of times they're not total propagandist. I'm not saying you're wrong, but it's better just to give people bites and let the chips fall where they may.
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.320]  And if they're deceptive with it, that's their problem.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:03:03.320]  Yes, sir. Also, I just want to make one more quick point is I've been a paid firefighter for seven years and I've got six guys on my crew and three of us listen to you regularly and the other two more listen to you quite a bit.
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:07.320]  And I just want to say about all the dog and pony show about 9 11.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:13.320]  You know, we it's not the right way to honor all the Americans that died by having a parade.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:22.320]  The only way to really honor these people is to bring the perpetrators to trial and they can end up like Stalin.
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:29.320]  Well, you're absolutely right. Most people can't believe they've got an evil system running them until after it comes out.
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:35.320]  It's like finding out your neighbor has got 10 people buried in the backyard, but he was such a nice man. It's so shocking.
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:42.320]  But a lot of times it is the people that come off as real friendly and slick. That's who you got to really watch.
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:46.320]  If somebody who obviously is foul, you at least know they're coming.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:54.320]  But but but going back with your firefighter friends, do they question the official story of 9 11?
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:04:01.320]  Everybody on my crew, but one, unfortunately, throughout the department, our numbers aren't that strong.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:06.320]  I don't know exactly how many, but I've definitely seen it grow a lot.
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:12.320]  I figured it out about five years ago and I've been very outspoken and I was.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:19.320]  You know, called a kook and all that stuff and now people are starting to come around and I can actually have conversations with people at work.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:22.320]  So it is.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:27.320]  Well, don't feel bad when they call you a cook. That's because they're in darkness.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:30.320]  They're ignorant and you're lovingly helping them.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:36.320]  In fact, enjoy it when you get called to cook because it means they're getting upset. You're you're getting through to them.
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:41.320]  And it's just a service you're doing. And I know it's a painful news to bring, but you're making a sacrifice.
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.320]  That's why you're a firefighter.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:47.320]  Briefly, what do you think of them barring the actual first responders from the event?
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:52.320]  It makes me sick and I think everybody should be up in arms about that.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:56.320]  And it's just it's just a slap in the face. So disrespectful.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:00.320]  But it certainly is. God bless you. Be safe out there while you're helping your community. A true servant.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.320]  Hello, friends. Alex Jones here.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:05.320]  You all know I've worked for years with Steve Shank and E-Foods Direct.
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:08.320]  I have E-Foods for my own emergency food supply.
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:11.320]  You know, Steve, life is different now for all of us, isn't it?
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:15.320]  Very different. People are using this great food to survive the present hurricane season.
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:21.320]  And we've already had $40 billion worth of damage from floods, storms, quakes and droughts.
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:24.320]  And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:28.320]  Natural disasters are newsworthy, but only touch a few of us Americans.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:32.320]  The huge issue of the greatest depression is on everyone's mind.
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:38.320]  The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses and skyrocketing food costs are hitting every American.
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.320]  So everyone needs food security.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:44.320]  Folks, this month you will get free shipping on every food order from E-Foods Direct.
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:47.320]  That's right. Every order gets free shipping starting September 6th.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:50.320]  Get stocked up with the best adorable foods out there with E-Foods Direct.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:53.320]  And be prepared for any emergency before it happens.
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:06:00.320]  Take advantage of this special call 800-409-5633 or go to E-FoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:08.320]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions,
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:11.320]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:16.320]  and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:21.320]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:26.320]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:34.320]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:42.320]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:52.320]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:56.320]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:12.320]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:34.320]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves,
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:38.320]  warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:41.320]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:46.320]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:51.320]  You'll also get a free copy of supermarket survival, how to cut your grocery bills in half.
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:56.320]  And again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:22.320]  RisingpricesEmptyShelves.com.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:35.320]  RisingpricesEmptyShelves.com.
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:40.320]  We are now into the second hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:45.320]  We're going to be going back to your calls, Micah, Michael, Steve, Ken, and others.
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:50.320]  We are joined by Alfred Adask, who we had on, I don't know, six months ago or so,
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:56.320]  when 60 Minutes had a special about himself and others, just demonizing him like he's incredibly evil.
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:00.320]  And then all he does is talk about the Constitution, Bill of Rights, common sense.
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:06.320]  And of course, we discussed then the fact that they're rebranding terrorism off of Alciada,
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:10.320]  over to domestic groups that want to get our republic back.
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:16.320]  And his website is adask.wordpress.com.
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:22.320]  Here's his bio. I'm Alfred Adask and the author of virtually all of the text published on his website.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:29.320]  And then it just goes into all the things that he's done over the years fighting the globalists.
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:34.320]  So we're going to be talking to him for the rest of the hour and taking your calls.
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:39.320]  And then I've got news items. I want to get his take on things happening in the news
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:45.320]  and what he thinks of the globalists, because they know that their vaccines are killing people.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:50.320]  They openly now admit that the government's growing the opium in Afghanistan
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:53.320]  and shipping it into the U.S. and having the troops grow it.
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:59.320]  It came out in federal court in Chicago. This, again, is in the El Paso Times.
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:02.320]  Narcosphere News. It's up on infowars.com.
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:07.320]  Federal filing, where when they bust these narco terrorists now, they're bringing into court.
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.320]  The fact that they work for the CIA, bringing narcotics in.
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:12.320]  And the federal government's saying, yes, national security, it's true.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:16.320]  But still, we want him to go to jail. That's kind of like Hal Turner,
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:22.320]  who attacked me for like a decade saying I was covering up for Israel when we're critical of Israel.
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:28.320]  And he used to work with Sean Hannity and he would say, kill this federal judge, get that federal judge.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:31.320]  This judge needs to die and never get in trouble.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:37.320]  And I said, that guy's a fed. And I said, you better watch it, buddy. They'll set you up.
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:42.320]  People hacked his email and got his emails from the FBI where they were handling him.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:46.320]  And so he was no longer useful. So they put him in jail.
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:50.320]  And what he's facing the trial right now for stuff he was ordered to do on record.
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:56.320]  And the FBI came in and said, Mr. Turner is our highest level national security operative.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.320]  Not an agent, but he does work in our employ.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:01.320]  And, but go ahead and put him in prison.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:06.320]  See, that's a message all you guys need to get through your head.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.320]  The Sinaloa drug cartel head is in the news.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:11.320]  Here it is right here in my little hand.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:14.320]  It's up on infoworks.com with a link to the federal filing.
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.320]  You'll be on the federal courts website.
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.320]  They're like, yeah, yeah, we brought in tens of tons of cocaine.
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.320]  Yeah, we're shipping guns into Mexico, Honduras.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:25.320]  We're shipping them into Illinois, Texas, Florida, California.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:31.320]  That's now all mainstream news and nobody gets in trouble except their own minions.
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:36.320]  So we're talking about a synthesis of evil that runs our society.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:42.320]  You see, you could have an emperor, philosopher, king who wanted to build public works,
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:45.320]  wanted to educate people and wanted to build a civilization.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:51.320]  And we've seen maybe 20 cases of that or less in 6,000 years of recorded history.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:56.320]  And you'll see civilizations leap forward under that because they actually take the
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:01.320]  largesse and actually build things for populations.
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:08.320]  But what happens is and have a vision and try to bring science to the public.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:12.320]  The problem is they always die.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:15.320]  And maybe their son isn't as bad, but the grandson's a psychopath.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:17.320]  And then he has an even crazier son.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:20.320]  And pretty soon it's Roman emperors marrying their horse.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:22.320]  Caligula would march the horse in.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:23.320]  It would go to the bathroom.
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:26.320]  He'd have the high priest read it like tea leaves.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.320]  I'm not joking.
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.320]  This is mainline history.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:31.320]  They normally gut a bull and read the guts or spill the blood all over them.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:34.320]  And how the splatters were, they would then pour tin.
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:39.320]  But he made them worship the horses dung basically just as an act of power,
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:43.320]  an act of insanity or burn part of the city for fun like Nero and get so decadent.
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.320]  They commit suicide.
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.320]  This is what happens.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:51.320]  The worst of the worst get in control and you get a Stalin, a Hitler, a Mao,
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:54.320]  a Pol Pot that Zbigniew Brzezinski bragged.
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:13:00.320]  He supported who killed 30% plus of the people of Cambodia.
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:03.320]  And then Brzezinski writes books bragging.
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:04.320]  They bragged.
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.320]  Whenever Brzezinski walks into a lovely meeting, they're like,
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.320]  Oh, you're gracious news.
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:12.320]  They get off on how many deaths they've committed.
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:14.320]  So that's my view on their philosophy.
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:17.320]  There really isn't a philosophy at all.
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:20.320]  It's just trampling and being trampled.
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.320]  Always pressing on the nerve of power.
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.320]  We're the priest of power, Winston.
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:25.320]  In fact, later I want to read it.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:28.320]  We'll hold it to ask you into the next hour to give them the full time here because I'm on a roll.
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:31.320]  But will you print me from 1984?
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:40.320]  You can just type in Winston picture a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:43.320]  It's about 10 paragraphs above that and about five below that.
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:47.320]  I want to read that later because that describes the full globalist system.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:57.320]  It's a world built by sadist and psychopaths to carry out always greater and greater dumbing down and ugliness because it's beautiful to them.
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:02.320]  Liberty and independence is anathema.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:05.320]  It's like nails on a chalkboard to these people.
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.320]  Alfred had asked, good to have you here with us.
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:13.320]  Give us your view on the philosophy of the parasites and what they're building and your fight against them.
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:17.320]  Well, I can tell you that it's good to be here first off, Alex.
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:18.320]  I appreciate you having me on.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:26.320]  But we were, I was one of seven defendants that were sued back in case started in 2001.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.320]  I wasn't added until 2006.
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:34.320]  I was last to seven defendants sued for the manufacturing distribution of a controlled substance.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:37.320]  And the controlled substance was colloidal silver.
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:38.320]  All right.
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:41.320]  It wasn't heroin or cocaine or something like that or methamphetamine.
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:44.320]  That I can buy at ATB and Whole Foods here in Austin right now.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.320]  That's exactly right.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.320]  And I volunteered to be fiduciary for a trust.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:51.320]  The trust was one of the defendants in the case they made me a defendant.
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:56.320]  We were threatened with fines each defendant $25,000 per day.
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.320]  That's $9 million per year.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:05.320]  I read the relevant case and I guarantee you being sued for $9 million a year focuses your attention.
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:08.320]  And I read the relevant law and what we discovered.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:12.320]  I read the definition of drugs in both the state and federal health code.
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:15.320]  And this goes to your notion about what their philosophy is.
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:19.320]  The Texas Attorney General wrote in part in his case.
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:23.320]  He said, the key to this case lies in determining at law, not as a matter of fact,
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:28.320]  whether the defendant's colloidal products met the definition of drug when mislabeled.
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:36.320]  And then he quotes from the Texas Health and Safety Code section 431.002 subparagraph 14,
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:39.320]  which defines the word drug.
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:44.320]  And it says, drug means article recognizing the United States Pharmacopy and National Formulary,
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.320]  any supplement to it.
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:50.320]  Articles designed or intended for the use in the diagnosis, cure mitigation,
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:57.320]  treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals.
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:01.320]  Now, I saw that and the first thing I thought is right, God, why the people are damn crazy.
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.320]  The people who wrote this thing don't understand English.
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:08.320]  When they say man or other animals, they're not saying man or animals.
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:14.320]  They're saying man or other animals, which means they deem man to be an animal.
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.320]  And what you discovered is something we similarly discovered decades ago.
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:22.320]  And for all of us, we discovered this in different ways.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:27.320]  In hundreds of globalist documents and documents going back thousands of years,
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:32.320]  all governments that oppress, Hitler did it, the Babylonians did it, the Israelites did it,
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:35.320]  they would always list the slaves as non-human.
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:37.320]  We listed blacks as non-human.
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:39.320]  It's a legalese.
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:42.320]  They see themselves as exalted and awake.
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.320]  And that's what they mean in the movie, they live.
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:47.320]  When you have the glasses, they say, I've got one that can see.
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:52.320]  When you actually converse with a globalist in person, they shake in fear because they,
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.320]  and they'll say, oh, you're a human.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:17:00.320]  And that's what Frank Herbert wrote about in Dune, is that the elite don't see most of us as human.
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:01.320]  Go ahead.
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:04.320]  Well, first time I saw it, I just thought it was a mistake.
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:07.320]  Then they said man or other animals a second time in the same definition.
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:16.320]  Then I read the federal code at title 21, section 321, subparagraph G subsection or subsection G subparagraph 1.
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:20.320]  And it says, again, virtual identical definition of drugs.
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:23.320]  Drugs are for man or other animals.
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:30.320]  What we did, I realized that they are treating it the presumption for these definitions as that we are animals.
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:38.320]  And I also understand enough about the Bible where I know that at Genesis chapter 1, sections 26 through 28,
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:45.320]  it says on the sixth day God created man in his image and gave man dominion over the animals.
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:53.320]  Which means that as a Jew or Christian and probably even as a Muslim, I assume the Muslim faith has a similar notion about Genesis,
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:55.320]  although I don't know that to be true.
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:18:03.320]  But as a Jew or a Christian, you can't call me an animal without violating my freedom of religion.
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:08.320]  I drafted a defense in this case that was based on freedom of religion.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:15.320]  And I said, you can't call me an animal, you can't charge me 25 grand a day based on the presumption that I'm an animal,
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:20.320]  because I am a man made in God's image and I'm endowed and then I went on with the death sentence.
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:23.320]  And I want you to continue with this and then get into what's happening currently.
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:28.320]  You're telling us who the globalist are, they see us as animals, but what you've hit on here is so central.
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:34.320]  Even if someone's an agnostic or an atheist and they don't believe in God, they need to say,
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:42.320]  I believe in a higher power because if you don't, there's always a higher power than some king rat, some strong man,
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:49.320]  some gang, some guy named humongous with a motorcycle gang, is going to put himself above you.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:54.320]  That's what Thomas Jefferson was saying. We're saying, uh-uh, buddy, we got freedom in the universe.
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:57.320]  And if you don't get it from God, you don't get it.
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.320]  That's right.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:04.320]  All right. That's the point to this. If you're willing to be an animal, you can be treated just like a chicken.
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:07.320]  That's right. It's their rules. The globalists understand this.
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:12.320]  They believe they've been given the power of God to be a human, not an animal.
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:15.320]  Again, this is all law.
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:19.320]  Well, I agree. And it's not just all law. It goes back thousands of years.
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:23.320]  This is part of spiritual warfare. This isn't a new situation.
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:28.320]  It's the fund. It's the one of the essential acts of genocide is dehumanization.
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:34.320]  You can go to genocide.genocidewatch.org and they've got a document up there.
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:40.320]  No, no, they always do it. You are stating a giant naked truth, a trillion pound elephant in the living room,
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:44.320]  and half the audience, even though they're smart, is saying, what are they talking about?
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:47.320]  Let's go back to this point, Alfred.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:54.320]  A lot of times we stay on this topic, but I want to get into some other areas as well straight ahead.
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:20:00.320]  And by the way, I've got to get you on a routine basis. You're just amazing. We'll be right back.
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:04.320]  If you're a man over 40, you may feel like half the man you used to be.
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:09.320]  Are you gaining more body fat? Are you feeling tired? Are you losing your sex drive?
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:13.320]  It's not your fault. After 40, your body's testosterone may start dropping.
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:19.320]  And if you are an African-American man, you're at a higher risk of your testosterone turning into estrogen.
[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:24.320]  Be the man you used to be. Call for a risk-free trial of ageless male, a natural supplement,

[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:14.320]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage and enslavement.
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:22.320]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising, but take heart for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:28.320]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the Info War.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:32.320]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:38.320]  The globalists are scared. They've overreached. The future of the Info War is in your hands.

[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:29.320]  Okay, going back to Alfred Adesque.
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:34.320]  Sir, continue.
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:41.320]  Sir, please continue breaking down your research of the globalist and the world they want to build.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:46.320]  We understand they think they're gods and we're animals and they engineer us like animals and lie to us.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:55.320]  It's people that are part of the establishment even at lower level. Get off on deceiving, get off on dumbing down, get off on weakening.
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:25:02.320]  They want to get rid of the family. So where are these people going from your research? What are they wanting to build?
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:10.320]  I don't know what they want to build exactly. They want power. They are lovers of money. They want power and they are definitely ungodly.
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:16.320]  I mean, the whole concept of sovereignty flows from the idea that you receive your rights from God.
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:26.320]  If you're an animal, you have no more rights than a chicken, a pig, or a goat and the only thing to distinguish you from those other animals is you have firearms.
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:30.320]  They take your firearms away and they can handle you just like the rest of the livestock.
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:35.320]  It's the only thing from their perspective that makes you dangerous.
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:41.320]  Our Declaration of Independence started out and said we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal,
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:44.320]  that they're endowed by their Creator with certain unleanable rights.
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:48.320]  This is the foundation for individual sovereignty.
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:55.320]  In the past, the only sovereigns prior to the Declaration were the King of England, the King of Spain, the King of Italy, and so on.
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:59.320]  Those people were kings because they had the divine right of kings.
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:06.320]  They received their rights directly from God and all else were subjects because they did not get their rights directly from God.
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:10.320]  Alfred, I called this the giant trillion pound elephant in the room. There it is again.
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:17.320]  In all cultures, everyone had always been seen as animals as the subcast, as the garbage.
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:23.320]  In fact, in many ancient cultures, the elites would put animals up above humans to teach us we're trash.
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:30.320]  That's what the modern environmental movement is, not to help the environment, but to teach us to self-loathe,
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:35.320]  to not believe that we're special and made in the image of the Creator.
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:44.320]  It's all meant to make us think bad about ourselves, and now it's so alien to people to realize the globalist view when just a few hundred years ago,
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:48.320]  there were no systems where people weren't basically seen as chattel.
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:55.320]  Well, the one exception, again, in England, for example, the king and the king alone was sovereign because he had the divine right of kings.
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:59.320]  When our founders came across and they said, no, wait, in the Declaration of Independence,
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:05.320]  they said we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men they met, all men including kings, were created equal,
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:13.320]  and all were endowed by their Creator with certain unleanable rights that elevated all men to the status of sovereigns.
[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:18.320]  Under those circumstances, government became our servant rather than our master.
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:23.320]  It's the reason the Supreme Court ruled in Chisholm v. Georgia, 1793.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:31.320]  They said this was the people of the United States of America, our sovereigns, plural, without subjects.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:35.320]  It's based on this principle in the Declaration of Independence that we all affected.
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:39.320]  The unleanable rights, in my opinion, are equivalent to the divine right of kings.
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.320]  We get them from God.
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:48.320]  No, they are. That's why all the legalese and bureaucracy that's outside of true common law is you are now subject to seizure.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:51.320]  You are now a licensure. You're being licensed.
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:28:00.320]  As a slave, you're being given, and black slaves had to wear these, a tag around your neck with a note saying where you're allowed to go.
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:05.320]  And here are these cops thinking it's a normal system, thinking it's constitutional, thinking it's to keep everybody safe.
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:11.320]  And we're all running around with our little papers. I mean, just 60 years ago, we knew Germany was bad.
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:14.320]  You had to have papers to travel internally in the country.
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:21.320]  Now we just accepted, and in New York City, I wanted to raise this, they arrested 9-11 truthers, not at ground zero,
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:28.320]  but basically anywhere in lower Manhattan and would arrest you if you spoke on a street corner and handed out literature.
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:31.320]  But others who were handing out pro-government, they were allowed.
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:34.320]  I mean, we're getting very far down this road.
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:36.320]  Yeah, I know. I agree.
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:42.320]  And for what we've had people, I've been contacted by one man from Australia, another guy from England,
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:46.320]  who's heard me talk about man or other animals, relative to the drug laws.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:50.320]  And they researched the English drug laws, and they researched the Australian drug laws,
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:53.320]  and they tell me that you find the same presumption there.
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:54.320]  The people are animals.
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:29:01.320]  The reason this is so important is the presumption that the people are animals laid the foundation,
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:07.320]  lies at the heart of the drug war, the war on drugs that was started by President Nixon back in 1971.
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:10.320]  It's based on the presumption that we're all just livestock.
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:14.320]  And the war on drugs laid the foundation for much of the modern police state,
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:18.320]  and the police state laid the foundation for the prison-industrial complex.
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:24.320]  I've heard that 70% of people in federal pens are there on drug-related crimes.
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:31.320]  All of this is perched on a little definition of drugs that presumes the people to be animals
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:34.320]  in violation of our freedom of religion.
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:38.320]  And you've beat them in federal court. Let's talk more about that case.
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:44.320]  Get into some other news and phone calls with Alfred Adask right here on GCNLive.com.
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:46.320]  I'm Alex Jones. Stay with us.
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:53.320]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:57.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.320]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones.
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:08.320]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognized risk.

[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:27.320]  perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:31.320]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes,
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:35.320]  itching sores, and a tolerating clothing called lint.
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:38.320]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before,
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.320]  you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:31.320]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:34.320]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free,
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:37.320]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet,
[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:38.320]  and it's a real eye-opener.
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:40.320]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:42.320]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:44.320]  He explains everything you need to know,
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:47.320]  including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:51.320]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.

[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:02.320]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:05.320]  You all know I've worked for years with Steve Shank and E-Foods Direct.
[01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:08.320]  I have E-Foods for my own emergency food supply.
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:11.320]  You know Steve, life is different now for all of us, isn't it?
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:12.320]  Very different.
[01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:15.320]  People are using this great food to survive the present hurricane season,
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:19.320]  and we've already had $40 billion worth of damage from floods,
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:21.320]  storms, quakes, and droughts.
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:23.320]  And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:25.320]  Natural disasters are newsworthy,
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:27.320]  but only touch a few of us Americans.
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:31.320]  The huge issue of the Great Depression is on everyone's mind.
[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:33.320]  The unemployment, the loss of homes,
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:36.320]  lost businesses, and skyrocketing food costs
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:39.320]  are hitting every American, so everyone needs food security.

[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:32.320]  We are back live here, my friends,
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:38.320]  and I do want to get to Micub and Ken and Michael
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:42.320]  and many others that are patiently holding here in just a few minutes.
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:51.320]  I should add that we are seeing something really historical happening right now.
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:54.320]  Watching CNBC, listening to Bloomberg on radio,
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:56.320]  reading all their statements,
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:58.320]  we knew this was coming more than a decade ago,
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:00.320]  but we're now seeing it.
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:04.320]  And after bailout, after bailout in Europe, they're not bailouts.
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:10.320]  They're government taxes paid directly to the big six private megabanks.
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:14.320]  And each time it happens, the countries get more in debt
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:22.320]  because the countries go in debt to give the money to the private central banks.
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:27.320]  That's why they don't just monetize and give it to the banks
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:32.320]  to get the money off their books that then causes inflation,
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:37.320]  but that's still a better thing than publicly raising taxes,
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:40.320]  cutting infrastructure to implode the economy,
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:43.320]  and then paying that to the banks.
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:45.320]  Who are the ones you're bailing out?
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:47.320]  It's so simple, it's complex.
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:51.320]  They're the ones that engage in the fraud, you're bailing them out,
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:56.320]  but then you owe them money because you bailed them out
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:59.320]  because they're the people that authorize your government,
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:02.320]  the euro, the dollar, you name it to issue the currency.
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:08.320]  Now, they're openly saying the problem is the Germans won't vote for this
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:10.320]  and have had two elections since the bailout started,
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:13.320]  and they're about to get rid of Merkel.
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:16.320]  And I've heard them on CNBC and Bloomberg say,
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:18.320]  it's terrible that there's democracy.
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:21.320]  Of course, really, it should be a republic,
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:24.320]  but the point is they're saying it's too bad the people can vote
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:26.320]  because this is going to cause a world depression.
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:29.320]  Now, they've already maneuvered us to a world depression,
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:32.320]  but they then destroy confidence by saying the markets are down
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:35.320]  because the people aren't bailing us out,
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:38.320]  but the new third bailout isn't a bailout.
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:41.320]  It's transferring what's left of national sovereignty
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:44.320]  through the euro to this private banking system.
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:48.320]  So here is world government run by private corporations
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:54.320]  that have created the crisis openly holding Europe hostage
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:57.320]  while they have their banker chiefs go out and destroy confidence.
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:01.320]  Same thing that was done to get the Super Congress passed here.
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:03.320]  Same thing that was done for the bailout.
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:05.320]  Alfred, watching this,
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:08.320]  what's your view on how things are going for the New World Order?
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:10.320]  Well, I think they're desperate.
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:14.320]  I think I can't remember the name.
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:17.320]  One of the former secretaries of state criticized Bush
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:21.320]  during when he Bush first botched the invasion of Iraq
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:23.320]  and got bogged down there.
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:24.320]  I can't think of the man's name,
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:28.320]  but he says you've set the New World Order back 30 years.
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:31.320]  I think these people know they're on the ropes.
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:34.320]  You quoted earlier where Hillary Clinton said
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:38.320]  they're losing the information war, the information battle.
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:41.320]  I think they know they're on the ropes and they are desperate
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:44.320]  and they are pushing as hard as they can to make this happen
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:46.320]  before it all blows up in their face.
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:49.320]  We're in a situation where it's like two railroad trains
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:51.320]  coming for the same crossing
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:54.320]  and both of them are trying to go as fast as they can
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:56.320]  to get there first and get through without getting hit,
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:57.320]  but we'll see.
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:00.320]  We're approaching a great collision
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:02.320]  and we'll see how it unfolds.
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:04.320]  We're going to see stage terror attacks,
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:07.320]  new wars, bio weapon releases.
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:10.320]  We're entering a time of some of the greatest tumult
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:14.320]  and upheaval this earth has ever seen in human activities.
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:16.320]  And by the way, that was Brent Scrokoff,
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:19.320]  former National Security Advisor to George Herbert Walker Bush
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:24.320]  that did say George W. Bush had set the New World Order back 30 years.
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:25.320]  And so it's like NASCAR.
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:30.320]  They were three laps ahead of us,
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:34.320]  but since the globalists have gotten caught lying about WMD,
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:36.320]  staging 9-11 and other events,
[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:39.320]  they are now only about a car link ahead of us,
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:42.320]  their tires are bald, they're almost out of gas,
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:45.320]  and there's smoke coming out from under the hood.
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:47.320]  I understand.
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:51.320]  We are at the little man behind the curtain moment, right?
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:54.320]  People are beginning to understand that this thing has been run
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:58.320]  by a relatively small group of people who can be head
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:01.320]  if we want to stand up and do something about it.
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:03.320]  I listened to one of your ads earlier before the probe,
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:08.320]  before I got on at least, and you were talking about a food crisis.
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:13.320]  Let me ask you, do you know who the first economist was?
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:15.320]  There have been quite a few, but tell me.
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:19.320]  Joseph in the Bible goes all the way back to 1800 B.C.,
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:24.320]  and you can read about it in Genesis, chapter 47.
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:27.320]  When I was again, this relates to the food crisis.
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:30.320]  This is a little bit long, but this relates to the food crisis.
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:35.320]  Genesis 47 talks about Joseph in the Old Testament.
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:38.320]  What did he tell in the Egyptians the whole story about,
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:41.320]  he had the dream and you've got to have seven years of grain
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:43.320]  hooked back because of the famine?
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:44.320]  That's it.
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:46.320]  But the way I was taught it when I went to Bible school as a kid
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:49.320]  is Joseph, he knew there were going to be seven good years
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:51.320]  and then there were going to be seven bad years,
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:55.320]  and therefore he saved up the extra grain in the seven good years
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:58.320]  so people that have grain in the seven bad years.
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:38:59.320]  That's not true.
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:02.320]  Here's what happened, and you can read this in Genesis, chapter 47,
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:03.320]  and it says,
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:06.320]  And there was no bread and all the land for the famine was sore
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:09.320]  and was very sore in that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:10.320]  faded by reeds and a famine.
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:12.320]  In other words, we're into the seven bad years.
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:15.320]  Now, Joseph had stored up grain in the seven good years,
[01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:18.320]  but when the seven bad years came, here it says,
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:22.320]  Genesis 47, 14, and Joseph gathered up all the money
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:25.320]  that was found in the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:26.320]  for the grain which they brought,
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:29.320]  and Joseph brought the money into the Pharaoh's house.
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:32.320]  And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:33.320]  and in the land of Canaan,
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:36.320]  and all the Egyptians came unto Joseph and said,
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:38.320]  Give us bread, for why should we die in thy presence?
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:39.320]  For our money felleth.
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:44.320]  What they didn't understand, Joseph was selling grain.
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:46.320]  He wasn't giving it to the people.
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:48.320]  He knew there was going to be a shortage.
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:52.320]  He cornered the market on grain because he knew famine was coming.
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:55.320]  Then he sold the grain in the first year for money.
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:56.320]  He took all the money.
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:57.320]  He gave it to the Pharaoh.
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:00.320]  It moved into the money's house, into the Pharaoh's house.
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:02.320]  They took it out of circulation.
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:06.320]  And without money, the people could not work effectively
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:08.320]  to work their way through the famine.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:11.320]  This reminds me of 1933.
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:13.320]  Our government took the gold out of circulation.
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:16.320]  And in 1968, they took the silver out of circulation.
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:19.320]  And in that regard, they are paralleling what Joseph did
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:21.320]  3,800 years ago.
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:24.320]  And it goes on the second year, Joseph, they come back
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:25.320]  and say, we need some more food.
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:26.320]  Joseph said, give your cattle.
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:29.320]  And I will give you for your cattle,
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:31.320]  and they give you grain if the money fell.
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:34.320]  He knew it failed because he took it out of circulation.
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:37.320]  The people sold all their cattle in the second year to Joseph.
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:39.320]  In the third year, they came back.
[01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:40.320]  They were hungry again.
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:41.320]  They needed more.
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:44.320]  And this time, they sold themselves into slavery
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:46.320]  and all their land to Pharaoh.
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:48.320]  And that's exactly what the bankers have done.
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:50.320]  We're entering the third year.
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:52.320]  And every time we get in trouble,
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:55.320]  they bail us out by us bailing them out.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:57.320]  We give them our money.
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:00.320]  I mean, this is all scientifically done.
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:04.320]  And I tell you, Alfred, I learned very few new things from guest.
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:06.320]  And I'm learning stuff from you today.
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:09.320]  Well, I'll tell you that Genesis 47 is just astonishing.
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:11.320]  You read it and you read it closely.
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:14.320]  You realize, my God, they're explaining how economics works.
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:17.320]  And they understood it 3,800 years ago.
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:20.320]  I don't think it's an accident
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:24.320]  that a modern economics text is almost impossible to understand.
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:27.320]  I don't think they want you to understand it.
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:29.320]  Joseph understood economics.
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:32.320]  You take the money out of circulation, corner the market on food,
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:34.320]  and you can put the people into bondage.
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:35.320]  And let me stop you there.
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:38.320]  They've taken the money and put it in Pharaoh's house.
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:42.320]  For three years now, they've taken 16 trillion domestically.
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:44.320]  The tens of trillions that went overseas.
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:46.320]  Bloomberg says it's more like 28 trillion.
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:48.320]  Other economists I have on say it's more like 18.
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:51.320]  Whatever. They've taken the tens of trillions of our money
[01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:53.320]  that we've got to pay taxes on in interest.
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:56.320]  They've given it to the mega families.
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:59.320]  But people are worried about inflation.
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:03.320]  It hasn't been that bad yet because they hoarded it
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:05.320]  and did not loan it back.
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:09.320]  So they put us under great bondage of debts that's fraudulent.
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:12.320]  They put us under taxes, under austerity,
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:14.320]  which they know kills the economy.
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:16.320]  All these other independent economists are saying,
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:18.320]  why are you doing this? This is killing the economy.
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:23.320]  They further put us under the famine while they fully control
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:26.320]  all the money holding it in Pharaoh's house.
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:29.320]  And then come back and say, give us absolute power
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:32.320]  in a private corporate world government and we'll fix it.
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:35.320]  And the people give them even more power and it doesn't.
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:39.320]  Because at the end of the day, they don't want people here in Egypt.
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:41.320]  The globalists want us dead.
[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:43.320]  They want the entire land.
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:45.320]  They don't want our oxen. They don't want our children.
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:50.320]  They don't want our women. They want us all wiped out and dead.
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:55.320]  New world order. They complete total domination in game.
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:57.320]  I agree. I agree.
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:42:59.320]  And you know, you mentioned food crisis.
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:01.320]  They've taken the money away.
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:03.320]  If they can, if they can shut the food supply down
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:06.320]  under the pretext of an economic collapse or whatever,
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:09.320]  I guarantee you people will follow this government
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:11.320]  to get themselves a bowl of rice.
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:13.320]  They'll do whatever is required to stay alive.
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:16.320]  They did it 3,800 years ago.
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:18.320]  Joseph did it. It's right there in the Bible if you care to read it.
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:21.320]  And they are on the verge of perhaps doing the same thing
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:25.320]  or at least attempting to do the same thing today.
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:27.320]  Alfred had asked, I want to go to calls,
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:29.320]  but hopefully we'll keep it a little bit in the next hour.
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:32.320]  Go ahead.
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:35.320]  Let's continue.
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:38.320]  Because I want to bring up another modern example of what's happening
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:41.320]  and then perhaps you can give us historical or biblical parallel.
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:43.320]  I think people are learning right now more than ever.
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:45.320]  Why have you no history?
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:48.320]  You know the present and the future because humans act the same
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:53.320]  and global technocrats and corrupt empires and social engineers
[01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:55.320]  learn the same tricks back then.
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:58.320]  Today they're just even more slick, more controlling
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:01.320]  with added chemicals in the food and water to fog our minds
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:07.320]  so that we're not operating anywhere near our proper capacity.
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:09.320]  The drug war.
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:12.320]  It's now come out again in federal court that yes,
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:15.320]  the ATF and CIA are shipping in, in some cases,
[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:19.320]  hundreds of tons in this latest filing of cocaine
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:21.320]  with Sinaloa in the last five years,
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:24.320]  arming gangs all over Latin America and the US
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:28.320]  to kill the other gangs that don't launder their money
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:30.320]  through the megabanks through Pharaoh's house.
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:32.320]  Because again, they can't have that money out there helping people.
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:35.320]  They've got to hoard it because it's a tax on production.
[01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:38.320]  It's a tax to make people poor so you control them.
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:43.320]  It's about putting the brakes on a powerful economy.
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:46.320]  It's about making you poor because if you become wealthy,
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:49.320]  you become independent and you don't want to be a slave.
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:52.320]  We're so productive they have to work to shut down
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:54.320]  human commerce and activity.
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:57.320]  They have to talk about shutting down the overheating economy.
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:00.320]  So continuing, what's the drugs being shipped in all about?
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:03.320]  What's the shipping guns into Mexico all about?
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:07.320]  What's all of this about and in your view?
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:13.320]  Well, what's the principle addictive ingredient in cocaine?
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:16.320]  It's the same addictive ingredient that you find in marijuana
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:19.320]  and methamphetamine and all the rest of the illegal drugs
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:23.320]  and the principle addictive ingredient is cash.
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:26.320]  That's what everybody, you legalize the drugs
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:28.320]  and you take the money out of it.
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:31.320]  You know, I remember back in the 1960s,
[01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:35.320]  they were talking about, I remember a Time Magazine article,
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:38.320]  they were saying, oh my God, the drug smugglers
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:41.320]  are making so much money they'll be able
[01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:44.320]  to elect their own congressmen and senators.
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:45.320]  And what would they do?
[01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:47.320]  Legalize drugs.
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:50.320]  The last thing they want to do is legalize drugs.
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:52.320]  You legalize drugs, you take the money out of it.
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:55.320]  There'd be some people who would still use it,
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:57.320]  but most people are addicted to the cash
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:58.320]  that's involved in the drugs.
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:00.320]  Hey, 85 years ago, Alfred, as you know,
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.320]  you could walk into any corner drug store
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:06.320]  and buy Lodinum, buy heroin, buy cocaine.
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:09.320]  And it was seen as what losers did
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:12.320]  and very few people were on drugs.
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:13.320]  I've seen the statistics.
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:15.320]  I mean, it was a sad thing.
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:17.320]  And yeah, I've been out in the country side
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:19.320]  and come across an old homestead.
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:21.320]  And back in the trash pile,
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:23.320]  you see hundreds of Lodinum bottles,
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:25.320]  little brown bottles, they're everywhere.
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:27.320]  And let me tell you, you had a toothache
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:28.320]  or whatever had the flu.
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:30.320]  You drank that, there's no more pain.
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:31.320]  A lot of people did just use it.
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:34.320]  But when you make it illegal, it puts the cash in it.
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:36.320]  It puts the cars, the girls,
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:38.320]  now young kids think it's cool,
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:41.320]  the perfect bait to sell the public on using it.
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:42.320]  That's exactly right.
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:44.320]  That's why they don't want to legalize.
[01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:46.320]  That's why they want the war on drugs
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:48.320]  in order to maintain the illusion
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:50.320]  they're trying to do something about it.
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:52.320]  The truth is they want drugs to be illegal.
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:54.320]  And then they use it to corrupt the cops.
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:56.320]  Then they use it to corrupt the cops.
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:57.320]  And once you've got the cops corrupt,
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:47:00.320]  now you can move on to other corruption.
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:02.320]  One of the things I observed years ago,
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:04.320]  I published a magazine called The Anti-Scheister,
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:07.320]  and you could see which states had
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:09.320]  the most corrupt judiciaries.
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:11.320]  And we thought Texas was number one,
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:13.320]  but in the end I gave the nod to Florida.
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:16.320]  But it was essentially the states
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:19.320]  where drugs were being imported into this country.
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:22.320]  The drugs coming into Florida came in in such mass
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:24.320]  that virtually every judge in the state
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:26.320]  ultimately became corrupt.
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:28.320]  The same thing, much the same thing happened in Texas
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:30.320]  and along the borders.
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:32.320]  It was the states where the drugs were
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:34.320]  pouring into the country.
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:36.320]  That's where the judiciary was most corrupt
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:38.320]  because that's where the money was flowing freely
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:40.320]  to bribe the judges.
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:43.320]  That drug money helped, and it corrupted the judicial system.
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:46.320]  Just ten years of alcohol prohibition
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:49.320]  turned Chicago from a bustling,
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:52.320]  predominantly Irish,
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:55.320]  a German Christian type enclave
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:58.320]  into the most corrupt city probably in the country.
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:02.320]  Just ten years of that liquor money,
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:05.320]  which again, they used well-meaning Christians
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:07.320]  to ban alcohol, but it turns out
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:10.320]  key insiders were behind actually getting it passed.
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:12.320]  And so they were making a hundred times
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:14.320]  what they were making before, conservatively.
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:16.320]  Absolutely.
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:18.320]  I mean...
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:20.320]  And again, bringing the liquor in out of Canada
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:22.320]  through Chicago.
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:24.320]  Right now if you see drug enforcement
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:26.320]  to some degree,
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:28.320]  drug enforcement is perpetrated
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:31.320]  in my opinion against those drug cartels
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:33.320]  that are less favored.
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:34.320]  Of course!
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:35.320]  For ones that are more favored.
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:37.320]  They can move that stuff in and out without much problem.
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:39.320]  They're just eliminating competition
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:41.320]  for the big boys.
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:43.320]  Not much problem.
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:45.320]  I see reports every few years of state police
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:47.320]  stop 18 Wheeler with three and a half tons
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:49.320]  of pure cocaine, meaning from source.
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:51.320]  And the CIA shows up,
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:53.320]  they order it and they let the truck
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:54.320]  drive right out to delivery.
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:56.320]  And they tell the state police,
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:58.320]  stand down Bubba, that's our money.
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:01.320]  I mean, no wonder, listen, I had a friend in college
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:04.320]  and his dad was a senior FBI agent.
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:06.320]  And I was smart, you know, when I was...
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:08.320]  I guess it was actually in high school because it was the gym
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:10.320]  and then I knew him a little bit into college.
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:12.320]  And I went over to their house,
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:14.320]  it was like in the most fancy area of Austin.
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:17.320]  I mean, it was probably a $3-4 million house then.
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:19.320]  It'd be like $10 million today.
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:21.320]  And I'm like, is your dad into stocks?
[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:23.320]  Is your mom rich or something?
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:25.320]  And the next door neighbor was the lady who...
[01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:27.320]  Barney, the purple dinosaur.
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:29.320]  I remember going to a cookout and it's like,
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:31.320]  here's the lady who invented Barney.
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:33.320]  I mean, this is like, you know, this is 10-bedroom houses
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:36.320]  up on the best part of Austin, overlooking the river.
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:38.320]  And it's like, no, it was just an FBI agent.
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:40.320]  And I'm like, well, has your dad...
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:42.320]  has your dad inherited something?
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:44.320]  And I don't think, you know, they liked that question
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:46.320]  and the dad came over and was like,
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:48.320]  why are you asking those questions for?
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:50.320]  But the point is then I learned most these guys
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:52.320]  were like this, they're all...
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:54.320]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:56.320]  I saw a friend of mine.
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:58.320]  In fact, what he did, not exactly a friend.
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:01.320]  He was a boyfriend of a woman I knew, her daughter.
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:04.320]  And his dad was a tax court judge.
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:06.320]  And he was helping...
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:09.320]  his dad build a new house outside of Dallas
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:11.320]  and out more or less in the country.
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:14.320]  That house had to be worth at least a half million dollars.
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:16.320]  It had secret passages in it.
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:19.320]  It had a place you could hide and rest, that sort of thing.
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:22.320]  There's no way that man was building that house
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:25.320]  on his salary as a tax court judge.
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:27.320]  I mean, it was just obvious evidence.
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:29.320]  The guy is... he was dirty.
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:31.320]  You know, I liked the son, but the father...
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:35.320]  I never met the father, but the guy had to be taken bribes.
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:37.320]  Well, they admit it now
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:41.320]  that police are keeping a lot of the money they seize.
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:43.320]  See, if they get it from the feds, they seize it,
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:45.320]  give it to the feds, they get it back directly.
[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:46.320]  But if it goes into the state fund,
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:48.320]  they only get a certain percentage back.
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:50.320]  I promise we're going to your phone calls on the other side
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:51.320]  with Alfred of Desk.
[01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:55.320]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv,
[01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:57.320]  or the websites will be on TV tonight,
[01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:00.320]  7 o'clock Central, prisonplanet.tv.
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:02.320]  You've been lied to.
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:04.320]  Lied to by the Wall Street propaganda machine,
[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:06.320]  the government, and the talking heads in the media.
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:09.320]  The market has proven that it's more like a casino
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:10.320]  than an investment.
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:11.320]  And if you've had enough
[01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:13.320]  and want to keep your hard-earned money safe,

[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:18.320]  and after losing 35% of my money
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:20.320]  when the market crashed several years ago,
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:21.320]  I said enough.
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:24.320]  Since then, I discovered a way to safely grow your money,
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:25.320]  cut taxes dramatically,
[01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:27.320]  get potential double-digit gains,
[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:30.320]  but also have my money protected when the crashes come.

[01:51:35.320 --> 01:51:37.320]  that people like Walt Disney and JCPenney used

[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:20.320]  Looks like we're going to probably be able to get the gentleman
[01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:23.320]  who was arrested in New York for daring to speak out
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:26.320]  against the inside job.
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:28.320]  We're becoming North Korea.
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:30.320]  Looks like we're going to have him on at the bottom
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:31.320]  of the next hour working on that.
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:33.320]  Alfred Dask with us, someone to the next hour.
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:34.320]  I appreciate everybody holding.
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:38.320]  So patiently, I want to go to Michael, then Ken,
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:41.320]  then Mitch, then Bill, then Arnold, and others.
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:44.320]  Let's go ahead and go to Michael in California.
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:45.320]  Thanks for holding.
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:47.320]  You're on the air with Alfred Dask.
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:48.320]  Go ahead.
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:49.320]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:50.320]  I hope I'm not off topic.
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:53.320]  I want to first tell you that leaders are chosen
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:55.320]  before they're even born.
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:57.320]  As the Bible says, they're selected.
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:54:59.320]  So you're in good shape, Alfred.
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:00.320]  Thank you so much.
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:05.320]  I want to do a three-point blast.
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:08.320]  You were speaking to Jesse Ventura about a few interviews back,
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:11.320]  and he, on the break, coming on the break,
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:12.320]  he mentioned Dr. Mary's monkey.
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:14.320]  I'm not plugging, but Dr. Mary's monkey
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:16.320]  talked about the polio shot.
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:20.320]  That was billed out to Ampule of $200 million
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:24.320]  between 1963 and 1965, which was sexually transmitted.
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:27.320]  Now, everybody probably on the planet had this before
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:28.320]  to end them.
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:31.320]  Well, that's not just in a book.
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:34.320]  That's an official government declassified.
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:36.320]  You can just search SV40 documents,
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:39.320]  and the government talks about over 100 million people
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:43.320]  probably dying from it and all these new cancers,
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:46.320]  and they've got a CBC interview with one of the scientists
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:48.320]  that worked with SOC, and he makes a joke about,
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:50.320]  well, there's too many people anyways.
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:53.320]  I mean, yeah, we're killing hundreds of millions.
[01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:56.320]  You see, something Hitler couldn't even do or Stalin,
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:58.320]  they just do right through the shots,
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:01.320]  but because it kills you 20, 30 years later,
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:03.320]  it's a soft kill.
[01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:05.320]  It's just like radiation.
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:07.320]  Oh, it kills you in 10 years, so what?
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:09.320]  But if you drink something and it kills you in five minutes,
[01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:10.320]  everybody gets really scared.
[01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:12.320]  Alfred, your view on that.
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:15.320]  Well, from their perspective, they don't want to kill you
[01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:19.320]  until you have outlived your economic usefulness.
[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:20.320]  That's another reason.
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:23.320]  If they can make everybody die at age 65,
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:27.320]  then the social security problem is resolved.
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:30.320]  They don't want to keep you on when you are consuming,
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:32.320]  purely consuming rather than producing.
[01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:33.320]  I'm honest about that.
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:35.320]  That's why they have the case for killing Granny,
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:37.320]  cover of Newsweek, says kill old people.
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:40.320]  You got Bill Gates telling teachers, hey, if we kill Granny,
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:43.320]  you'll get 10 jobs, and the people are like, kill, kill.
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:46.320]  This idea that you kill somebody and get something,
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:49.320]  the predators are teaching their armies.
[01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:52.320]  Do you know why you shouldn't kill people?
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:55.320]  Well, you don't kill somebody unless you're defending yourself.
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:59.320]  Well, here's the fundamental reason why murder is wrong.
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:03.320]  It's because, in my opinion, Genesis 9.6,
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:06.320]  it says the reason you can't kill a man
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:09.320]  is because man is made in God's image.
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:10.320]  That's right. It's up to God.
[01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:12.320]  Well, it's not just up to God,
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:16.320]  but the point is to kill a man is to destroy an image of God.
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:18.320]  It's effectively an act of blasphemy.
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:21.320]  Well, to be clear about the Ten Commandments,
[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:25.320]  it says thou shalt not murder, and they changed it to kill.
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:29.320]  Murder means wrongly kill somebody,
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:32.320]  but you're absolutely authorized.
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:35.320]  A bunch of verses, if somebody comes in to kill you in the night,
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:37.320]  rise up and kill them.
[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:39.320]  But this goes back to the concept of,
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:41.320]  if they can reduce you to the status of animals,
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:43.320]  you're no longer in God's image.
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:46.320]  If you're no longer in God's image, they can whack you.
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:48.320]  They can just take you out like a hive of wasps
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:50.320]  or nest of rats or anything else.
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:52.320]  Yep, it's all legalese.
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:54.320]  Why, and I appreciate your call-caller,
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:57.320]  why, Alfred, from Studying the Globalist?
[01:57:57.320 --> 01:57:59.320]  I know I have my perspectives,
[01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:04.320]  but why do they have to tell you what they're going to do to you beforehand?
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:07.320]  Just like legally, when you're seizing property
[01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:09.320]  or taking it by adverse possession,
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:11.320]  you've got to publish it in the newspaper three times.
[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:14.320]  Is that like the vampire has to trick you to invite them in?
[01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:17.320]  They have to effectively get your consent.
[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:19.320]  That's what it appears to be.
[01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:21.320]  As crazy as that sounds,
[01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:24.320]  it appears that the whole system is based on your consent.
[01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:26.320]  Do you consent to be an animal?
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:28.320]  Then we're going to treat you as an animal.
[01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:31.320]  And they have published that you're an animal in the law.
[01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:33.320]  Do you consent to that? Okay.
[01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:35.320]  Then we can handle you like an animal.
[01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:36.320]  They need your consent.
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:39.320]  That's right, that's why everything's about getting you to consent.
[01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:40.320]  Yeah.
[01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:43.320]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:51.320]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:55.320]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:59.320]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:01.320]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:04.320]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:08.320]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress,
[01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:10.320]  and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:15.320]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:59:15.320 --> 01:59:18.320]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:23.320]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:25.320]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:28.320]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:29.320]  They're asking for more matches,
[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:30.320]  and the Congress is saying,
[01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:32.320]  who do we make the checkout to?
[01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:34.320]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:36.320]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[01:59:36.320 --> 01:59:39.320]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:44.320]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[01:59:44.320 --> 02:00:10.320]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:17.320]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:32.320]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:35.320]  All right, continuing with your calls for another 20 minutes with Alfred Adask,
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:37.320]  then I'm going to get into a bunch of news.
[02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:38.320]  I've got to get to the news.
[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:41.320]  I do all this research and then don't end up getting to half of it.
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:44.320]  Big developments in Palestine.
[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:46.320]  Russia supports Palestinian bid to win U.N. statehood.
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:48.320]  This is starting to come to a head,
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:50.320]  so I'm going to get into some geopolitical news.
[02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:52.320]  Also, some Gardasil news.
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:55.320]  Alfred Adask is our guest, and I'm telling you,
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:01:00.320]  from my 20 years of research, 16, coming up on 17 years on air,
[02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:02.320]  he really gets it.
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:05.320]  And again, even if you don't believe the stuff he's talking about,
[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:07.320]  you hear Bible.
[02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:09.320]  You know, I say, hey, they're doing rituals at Skull and Bones.
[02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:11.320]  They're like, I don't believe in the devil.
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:13.320]  It doesn't matter if you don't believe in the devil or not.
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:16.320]  The people that run this planet, they do.
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:18.320]  It's like if I say there's a group of Aborigines
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:21.320]  worshiping the shark gods on some island
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:24.320]  and killing their neighbors for it.
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:26.320]  The point is, whether the shark gods real or not,
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:29.320]  these people are driven by it.
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:32.320]  And so what he's telling you is the truth.
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:38.320]  The controllers of this world are basically psychic vampires.
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:41.320]  They enjoy murder and death and killing,
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:43.320]  and they have all these weird rules,
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:46.320]  and they like to push you and henpeck you
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:48.320]  until you let the TSA put the hand in the pants
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:51.320]  and let them microwave you, because you go and consent.
[02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:53.320]  And then after you've consented for a while,
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:55.320]  then they say possession's nine-tenths,
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:57.320]  then they begin to force.
[02:01:57.320 --> 02:01:59.320]  They also have weird rules that once they get about half
[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:02.320]  the public to do something, then they start forcing.
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:04.320]  And we're getting to the forcing point.
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:06.320]  Once you get to a forcing point,
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:09.320]  it always just goes downhill very quickly.
[02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:11.320]  So the trap door is opening up.
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:13.320]  Everything we've seen so far is kind of like sliding
[02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:15.320]  into the cave entrance, but we can still get out.
[02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:18.320]  We're about to fall 5,000 feet.
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:20.320]  Okay, you think stuff's bad now.
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:23.320]  We're now scrabbling to a point where the talk
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:27.320]  is going to be over, and it's better to die
[02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:29.320]  on your feet than live on your knees.
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:32.320]  Everything I've done is trying to stop that.
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:34.320]  And I'm not for offensive operations,
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:36.320]  but you've got a right to defend yourselves.
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:38.320]  And there just comes a point where you don't want
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:39.320]  to go to a FEMA camp.
[02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:41.320]  I mean, you'll know.
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:43.320]  And then it's time to make a decision.
[02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:45.320]  Alfred, do you think we're getting closer and closer
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:47.320]  to decision time?
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:50.320]  I think so, but the one thing about it is this.
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:53.320]  When they have to force you, it becomes evidence
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:55.320]  that they're failing.
[02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:57.320]  It's not evidence of that they're gaining strength,
[02:02:57.320 --> 02:02:59.320]  but in my opinion, it's evidence that they're becoming
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:01.320]  increasingly desperate.
[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:03.320]  When the system is working properly,
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:06.320]  they will fleece you and you will not even notice
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:08.320]  or complain.
[02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:10.320]  When they've got to put a gun to your head
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:12.320]  before you surrender your fleece, it's evidence
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:14.320]  that they're really losing their fundamental power,
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:17.320]  which is deception and betraying trust,
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:19.320]  inspiring trust, and then betraying that trust.
[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:22.320]  When they've got to pull out the guns, they're in trouble.
[02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:26.320]  And it's the same thing with Nazi Germany and so on.
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:28.320]  I mean, when they've got to start pushing people
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:32.320]  around with guns, it's a sign that their end is near.
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:35.320]  But before we get there, we're going to go through
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:38.320]  purgatory or hell on earth because they will not
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:41.320]  just roll over and surrender because they think,
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:43.320]  you know, they may be running out of gas.
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:46.320]  They're going to hammer people if they possibly can.
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:48.320]  Well, they have to because they're going to be brought
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:50.320]  to justice when they fail.
[02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:53.320]  I mean, we've got a cornered goblin we're dealing with here.
[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:56.320]  And I totally agree with you that once the force comes in,
[02:03:56.320 --> 02:03:58.320]  that's because they're going into a whole new phase
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:00.320]  because they're desperate.
[02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:02.320]  And giving in to them isn't...
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:04.320]  Once they start the force, it doesn't end, people.
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:06.320]  You've got to go through this.
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:08.320]  You know, it's not fun. It's not happy.
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:10.320]  It's like when your car starts rolling down an embankment.
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:12.320]  It's not fun, but hold on to the steering wheel
[02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:13.320]  and pray to God.
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:15.320]  You know, we're going through this thing
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:16.320]  and that's the end of it.
[02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:18.320]  So you might as well batten down the hatches
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:20.320]  and get your cutlass.
[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:22.320]  And I'm talking about cutlass in the Info War.
[02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:24.320]  The pin is mightier than the sword.
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:26.320]  The Info War is king.
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:29.320]  And who shoots first loses.
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:30.320]  I agree with that, Alfred.
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:32.320]  Yeah, I'd say that's probably true.
[02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:34.320]  And I'll tell you something else I've been telling people lately.
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:37.320]  I absolutely advocate gun ownership.
[02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:39.320]  But I also tell people you should own
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:42.320]  at least as many dictionaries as you own firearms.
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:44.320]  It's in the words.
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:46.320]  If you can handle the words, you can handle the system.
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:48.320]  Exactly. If you can't handle the words,
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:50.320]  you can't handle a gun.
[02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:52.320]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:54.320]  because it's the mind that wields the gun.
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:05:01.320]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:03.320]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones.
[02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:06.320]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings,
[02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:08.320]  opportunity, and recognized risk.
[02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:10.320]  Saving means to make money.
[02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:13.320]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars
[02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:15.320]  and give you good old fashioned real soaps
[02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:17.320]  that are triple concentrated
[02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:19.320]  and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:22.320]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils
[02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:24.320]  that contain no useless dyes,
[02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:27.320]  perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:30.320]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:32.320]  that give you rashes, itching sores,
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:35.320]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:36.320]  If you want something better,
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:38.320]  if you want something you've never had before,
[02:05:38.320 --> 02:05:40.320]  you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:42.320]  Getting a free catalog is easy
[02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:45.320]  by calling 800-340-7091
[02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:48.320]  or see Calben on the web at 5starsope.com.
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:50.320]  Take charge of your health now
[02:05:50.320 --> 02:05:53.320]  by calling 800-340-7091
[02:05:53.320 --> 02:06:21.320]  or see Calben on the web at 5starsope.com.
[02:06:23.320 --> 02:06:25.320]  A solar power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:27.320]  and now new socialist legislation
[02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:29.320]  is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:31.320]  Number four, dangerous weather
[02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:33.320]  is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:35.320]  Every year, thousands of families
[02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:37.320]  lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:39.320]  Number five, a solar power generator
[02:06:39.320 --> 02:06:41.320]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:43.320]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:45.320]  offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:06:45.320 --> 02:06:47.320]  one of my old sponsors.
[02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:50.320]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:50.320 --> 02:06:52.320]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:54.320]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,
[02:06:54.320 --> 02:06:56.320]  so go to mysolarbackup.com
[02:06:56.320 --> 02:07:00.320]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:02.320]  When you're out on the road,
[02:07:02.320 --> 02:07:07.320]  the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:09.320]  But if the unfortunate happens,
[02:07:09.320 --> 02:07:12.320]  you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:16.320]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:21.320]  where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:25.320]  They so pride in every stitch,
[02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:29.320]  guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:32.320]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch
[02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:34.320]  where you need it most.
[02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:39.320]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:41.320]  We turned jeans inside out.
[02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:43.320]  Diamond gusset jeans,
[02:07:43.320 --> 02:07:46.320]  made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:48.320]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine
[02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:50.320]  gusset comfort with Kevlar protection
[02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:52.320]  so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:55.320]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:07:55.320 --> 02:08:21.320]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:29.320]  Alfred Adask is our guest.
[02:08:29.320 --> 02:08:32.320]  We're taking your phone calls right now.
[02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:33.320]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:08:33.320 --> 02:08:34.320]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:36.320]  We do have the gentleman, one of the people,
[02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:39.320]  arrested in Lower Manhattan
[02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:41.320]  for staying on the street corner
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:44.320]  while other people were allowed to stand around and talk.
[02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:47.320]  As long as they supported the official fable
[02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:51.320]  that Kevlar elves are garden gnomes
[02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:55.320]  out of Southeast Asia or Central Asia
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:58.320]  or maybe the North Pole carried out 9-11,
[02:08:58.320 --> 02:09:00.320]  a big deal to have somebody say,
[02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:02.320]  and I've got flyers here information
[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:04.320]  that was never a proper investigation.
[02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:06.320]  Six of the 10 commissioners say it's a fraud
[02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:07.320]  when you do an investigation.
[02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:09.320]  Cops, boom!
[02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:10.320]  Boy, you're not in America.
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:13.320]  We're taking you to the gulag.
[02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:15.320]  Man, it's amazing.
[02:09:15.320 --> 02:09:17.320]  Free speech zones to now
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:20.320]  you don't even stand on the street corner.
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:21.320]  Cops, do you have any idea
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:23.320]  that when you enforced tyranny like that,
[02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:25.320]  the world you're invoking,
[02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:26.320]  what you're doing to yourself
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:28.320]  that you're removing your own heads,
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:29.320]  your own defense?
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:32.320]  That's the amazing thing about this is,
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:34.320]  Alfred, is that they've got people
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:36.320]  so unconscious, so unaware,
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:38.320]  and these cops will follow basically
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:40.320]  any order in many areas,
[02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:43.320]  especially areas like New York, Illinois, California,
[02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:45.320]  that we've gotten to this point.
[02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:47.320]  What would you say before we go to calls here quickly
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:52.320]  to people out there who serve the system?
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:54.320]  Because from all my research,
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:57.320]  the system enjoys abusing its own minions
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:09:58.320]  more than anybody else,
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:00.320]  and why is that in your view?
[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:02.320]  I'm not sure what the answer is
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:04.320]  for abusing their own minions,
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:05.320]  but they certainly do it.
[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:07.320]  Anybody who's been close to the army,
[02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:10.320]  I mean, people age in orange in the Vietnam War,
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:12.320]  you get the, what, Gulf War illness
[02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:14.320]  out of the first invasion of Iraq.
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:17.320]  You get this problem after problem.
[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:19.320]  These people are routinely abused.
[02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:20.320]  They keep coming back.
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:23.320]  It goes to the idea that the government
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:26.320]  has an unlimited supply of money,
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:28.320]  and people are addicted to money
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:31.320]  for the same reason they're addicted to drugs.
[02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:32.320]  Again, the same thing.
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:34.320]  They're paying these people more money typically
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:36.320]  than they can make in the private sector,
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:38.320]  so they're going to hang on to their jobs.
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:39.320]  They will just follow orders,
[02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:41.320]  even if it puts them in jeopardy.
[02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:43.320]  And the globalists are soft-killing them.
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:45.320]  The globalists have done actuaries
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:47.320]  in no going back thousands of years
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:49.320]  that the military is going to have skills
[02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:50.320]  once they've gotten out,
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:52.320]  but are going to be older and wiser,
[02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:54.320]  and they don't want a force of healthy people
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:57.320]  that are aware, so they're all given
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:01.320]  soft-kill degenerative or fatal diseases.
[02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:03.320]  And we know that from the thousands of programs
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:04.320]  like Project Shad,
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:06.320]  where they murdered thousands and thousands
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:08.320]  of U.S. troops under secret programs.
[02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:11.320]  Of course, that's to kill them
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:13.320]  and to test the weapons,
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:15.320]  but also to test the scientist
[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:17.320]  who would then recruit other scientists
[02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:19.320]  to build large armies of people
[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:23.320]  who enjoy killing troops for many different reasons
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:24.320]  and who will follow orders.
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:28.320]  But soon they won't need that giant killer scientist corps
[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:31.320]  that is at the very top of the New World Order servant class
[02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:32.320]  right below the top families.
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:34.320]  It's all killer scientists,
[02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:37.320]  all bloodthirsty psycho scientists with high IQs.
[02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:39.320]  But in the future,
[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:41.320]  the globalists are shifting to a technocracy
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:43.320]  where everything is robotic and drone,
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:45.320]  and then they won't even need
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:48.320]  those scientists and technocrats anymore.
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:51.320]  That's why they're pushing for the self-aware computer.
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:53.320]  You know, one of the things,
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:56.320]  insofar as this is all done with money,
[02:11:56.320 --> 02:11:59.320]  and it's people's addiction to money
[02:11:59.320 --> 02:12:01.320]  that lies at the heart of this thing.
[02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:02.320]  I mean, you pay the people,
[02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:03.320]  they're going to just follow orders.
[02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:04.320]  They don't know what's going on.
[02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:07.320]  They know payday is on the 1st and the 15th,
[02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:08.320]  and that's all they need to know.
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:11.320]  The reason government can be so free with this money
[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:13.320]  is because they can spin it out of thin air.
[02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:15.320]  They use fiat currency.
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:17.320]  If you wanted to restore a government
[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:19.320]  that was responsible to the people,
[02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:20.320]  one of the first things you'd do
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:23.320]  is get back to a gold and silver-based currency.
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:25.320]  Because now the magicians can't...
[02:12:25.320 --> 02:12:26.320]  The magicians want out of thin air.
[02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:27.320]  Exactly. Now the magicians, again,
[02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:30.320]  they get the whole world out of a lie.
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:33.320]  People will kill for $100,
[02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:35.320]  and it's all just made up crud.
[02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:39.320]  And women, I mean, even educated women,
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:40.320]  they see a suitcase of money,
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:43.320]  they just literally fall to their knees,
[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:44.320]  most of them.
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:46.320]  Fast cars, houses, it's all crud,
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:49.320]  and these people will fall to their knees
[02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:53.320]  for a lie when they could stare out at the sun,
[02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:55.320]  the stars, creation,
[02:12:55.320 --> 02:12:58.320]  and actually see the true wealth all around them.
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:00.320]  Yeah, it's a terrible situation,
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:02.320]  and it involves values.
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:05.320]  All right, it's a situation, we do that
[02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:08.320]  because we are no longer in a nation, per se,
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:11.320]  they are encouraging to think in terms of being in an economy.
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:14.320]  In an economy, you have a completely different system of values
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:15.320]  than you do in a nation.
[02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:17.320]  In a nation composed of people,
[02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:20.320]  you have values that are conducive to being people,
[02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:22.320]  all right, being men and women.
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:25.320]  In an economy, it's all about the money.
[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:26.320]  Nothing matters.
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:27.320]  And that's Rand Corporation.
[02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:30.320]  Rand Corporation said 60 years ago,
[02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:32.320]  we're gonna get it away from men being strong
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:33.320]  and standing up for liberty,
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:35.320]  we're gonna make it all just about money,
[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:36.320]  we control that,
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:39.320]  and we can do whatever we want by increments.
[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:40.320]  That's exactly right.
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:44.320]  And they have literally destroyed so much.
[02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:48.320]  But again, ideas are bulletproof, they're transcendent,
[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:50.320]  they can be buried, but they can never be killed.
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:53.320]  If we can simply spread this information,
[02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:56.320]  99.9%, literally,
[02:13:56.320 --> 02:14:00.320]  99.9% of the 7 billion people on this planet,
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:02.320]  even if you think you're serving the system,
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:03.320]  you're being destroyed by it,
[02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:04.320]  why not break the trance?
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:06.320]  Why not join humanity?
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:08.320]  Why not come in for the big win?
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:10.320]  That's exactly right.
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:12.320]  I mean, the majority of people,
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:14.320]  I think the majority of people agree
[02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:16.320]  with what we're talking about right now,
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:18.320]  although they don't want to make the effort
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:20.320]  to understand it.
[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:23.320]  It takes hard work to understand these ideas.
[02:14:23.320 --> 02:14:24.320]  They don't just come to you.
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:26.320]  More than that, more than that,
[02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:28.320]  the subconscious, as you know, Alfred,
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:30.320]  is probably a thousand times more powerful
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:31.320]  than the conscious.
[02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:32.320]  It's the true brain,
[02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:34.320]  but the focus is the cerebral cortex.
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:39.320]  And the subconscious is primitive, though,
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:41.320]  and it makes a split-second decision.
[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:43.320]  These globalists are scary.
[02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:45.320]  If I face up to the fact that they're evil,
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:47.320]  I'll know that I've got to resist them.
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:49.320]  So I'm going to lie to myself
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:51.320]  and basically just run away from this.
[02:14:51.320 --> 02:14:54.320]  You know, this goes to the concept of consent,
[02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:55.320]  in my opinion.
[02:14:55.320 --> 02:14:57.320]  It goes back to a spiritual concept.
[02:14:57.320 --> 02:15:00.320]  If Satan is real and Satan is looking for your soul,
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:02.320]  he can't get it by coming up
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:04.320]  and just putting a gun to your head and killing you.
[02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:07.320]  He needs you to consent to sin.
[02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:10.320]  He needs you to essentially abandon
[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:12.320]  your own opportunity for salvation
[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:14.320]  by consenting to follow him.
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:15.320]  He can't just force it.
[02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:17.320]  He wants you to sell the birthright for the bowl of soup.
[02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:19.320]  That's exactly right.
[02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:21.320]  And then you be held.
[02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:23.320]  That, in my opinion, is at bottom
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:25.320]  why they really want your consent.
[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:27.320]  They're not playing for your money
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:29.320]  because they can print all they want in the house
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:30.320]  and the land.
[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:33.320]  Revelation says that the dark magicians
[02:15:33.320 --> 02:15:36.320]  that serve the beast traffic in men's souls.
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:38.320]  And that's what TV and it all about.
[02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:39.320]  They want to program you.
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:41.320]  They want your mind.
[02:15:41.320 --> 02:15:43.320]  They don't care about the money.
[02:15:43.320 --> 02:15:44.320]  They control that.
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:46.320]  They do want your psyche.
[02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:48.320]  For all you atheists out there,
[02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:51.320]  they want that psyche because these people
[02:15:51.320 --> 02:15:53.320]  are psychic vampires, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:53.320 --> 02:15:56.320]  These people are vampires.
[02:15:56.320 --> 02:15:57.320]  They are vampires.
[02:15:57.320 --> 02:15:59.320]  They're not sucking blood down the street.
[02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:01.320]  They do that at some of their rituals to stylize it.
[02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:04.320]  They want the energy.
[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:06.320]  I'd say they want your soul.
[02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:08.320]  They want you to surrender your soul.
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:11.320]  We're saying the same thing in a couple of different ways right now,
[02:16:11.320 --> 02:16:13.320]  but they can print all the money they want.
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:15.320]  That's not the issue.
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:18.320]  They're playing for something else in my opinion.
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:21.320]  Some people would object, of course,
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:24.320]  and they'd find it silly, but I think this is spiritual warfare.
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:27.320]  Everything I've seen and I didn't come to this as a holy ruler.
[02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:29.320]  I started studying the law
[02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:31.320]  and the most remarkable thing about that study
[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:34.320]  is it brought me back to the good Lord.
[02:16:34.320 --> 02:16:37.320]  I mean, it was not something I was looking for.
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:39.320]  It wasn't something I was hungry for.
[02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:41.320]  It was something that it drives you back
[02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:43.320]  and you begin to see, oh my God,
[02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:45.320]  I begin to get this stuff.
[02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:48.320]  This is spiritual warfare that's been going on for thousands of years.
[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:49.320]  Well, you're right.
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:52.320]  And again, the devil, the spirit of the world,
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:54.320]  the God of this world,
[02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:57.320]  creates all these fake counterfeits
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:16:59.320]  so that when you go to a church,
[02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:02.320]  it's not...
[02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:05.320]  And so you think, well, this isn't God.
[02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:07.320]  Yeah.
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:09.320]  I understand.
[02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:12.320]  I went to a 503C church.
[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:16.320]  I don't know, for about four or five weeks.
[02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:19.320]  Last month or two.
[02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:21.320]  And I just couldn't stand it.
[02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:23.320]  I just couldn't stand it.
[02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:25.320]  I had previously been attending a Bible study class.
[02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:27.320]  Well, you should be the preacher.
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:29.320]  Look, they got these seminaries
[02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:31.320]  and they picked these little weak men and women
[02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:33.320]  to just get up there and...
[02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:35.320]  That's why this country's gone to hell in a handbasket.
[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:36.320]  I understand.
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:38.320]  We don't have real clergy in this country.
[02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:40.320]  I don't know where they are.
[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:42.320]  It's 1776.
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:44.320]  That's exactly right.
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:46.320]  And in part because they did not get a tax break
[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:48.320]  out of the government.
[02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:51.320]  When you take that 501C3 church designation,
[02:17:51.320 --> 02:17:54.320]  part of the deal is you don't spend more than 5%
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:56.320]  of your resources on political action.
[02:17:56.320 --> 02:17:58.320]  No, you're right. Let's take another call.
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:00.320]  The only five prophets, they're all over the government.
[02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:02.320]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:04.320]  Mitch in Minnesota, thanks for holding.
[02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:06.320]  Hey, Alex, how's it going?
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:08.320]  Good. Go ahead.
[02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:10.320]  I just wanted to personally thank you
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:13.320]  for leading the crusade against this government service.
[02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:15.320]  Pretty awesome.
[02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:17.320]  Really inspiring.
[02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:20.320]  And I just wanted to ask what else I could be doing
[02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:22.320]  to wake people up to what's going on.
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:24.320]  I mean, I give them the website.
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:27.320]  I show them the videos and they either
[02:18:27.320 --> 02:18:29.320]  are just totally resistant to the thought
[02:18:29.320 --> 02:18:32.320]  or they just say they can't do anything about it.
[02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:34.320]  Well, you have to teach them they have power.
[02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:36.320]  Because yes, even people that are awake
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:38.320]  they have no power.
[02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:40.320]  I would go find an access TV facility
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:43.320]  even if it's 50 miles away, jump through the hoops,
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:45.320]  get my videos under videos on air.
[02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:48.320]  I would start a local newsletter that you even hand
[02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:51.320]  delivered to maybe 100 homes to start.
[02:18:51.320 --> 02:18:54.320]  I would be a leader yourself and don't ever
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:57.320]  expect that you are going to fix everything overnight.
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:00.320]  Just realize that resistance is victory
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:03.320]  and that it is the pouring yourself
[02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:05.320]  into something that gives it power.
[02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:07.320]  It is the commitment.
[02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:11.320]  And again, the teacher appears when the student is ready.
[02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:14.320]  We need people who are students
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:16.320]  because I'm a student who are also teachers
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:19.320]  and go to events, go to city council,
[02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:23.320]  speak about things and you will see
[02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:25.320]  the good come after you to help you
[02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:27.320]  and the evil will come.
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:29.320]  All these people in denial, I challenge them
[02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:32.320]  to get politically involved and they will run smack dab
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:35.320]  into criminals everywhere.
[02:19:35.320 --> 02:19:37.320]  And you need to experience the criminals
[02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:39.320]  because it's the criminals persecuting you
[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:41.320]  that will give you the power.
[02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:43.320]  Mr. Adasky, one more segment with us.
[02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:44.320]  I'm going to take a few more calls
[02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:45.320]  and we've got our guest popping in
[02:19:45.320 --> 02:19:47.320]  and I've got a bunch of news I want to get to as well.
[02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:49.320]  But often, Adasky is our guest.
[02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:51.320]  GCNLive.com is the website
[02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:57.320]  and Alfred's website is Adaskadask.wordpress.com.
[02:19:57.320 --> 02:20:00.320]  Great guy. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:20:00.320 --> 02:20:04.320]  Hey, Brian, if you could do just one thing today
[02:20:04.320 --> 02:20:06.320]  to ensure your family's food security,
[02:20:06.320 --> 02:20:07.320]  what would it be?
[02:20:07.320 --> 02:20:08.320]  That's easy, Bill.
[02:20:08.320 --> 02:20:12.320]  I've head straight to soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:20:12.320 --> 02:20:14.320]  Soupbeansurvival.com?
[02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:15.320]  I know, Bill, it sounds crazy,
[02:20:15.320 --> 02:20:17.320]  but this ancient secret has been around
[02:20:17.320 --> 02:20:20.320]  for over 8,000 years
[02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:24.320]  and it truly is nature's super-survival food.
[02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:26.320]  Really, Brian? The number one survival food?
[02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:28.320]  Well, certainly the forgotten survival food.
[02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:32.320]  Absolutely, Bill. The folks at soupbeansurvival.com
[02:20:32.320 --> 02:20:37.320]  scoured our planet to find the very best heirloom seeds
[02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:41.320]  to truly find nature's super-survival food.
[02:20:41.320 --> 02:20:43.320]  Brian, these aren't grocery store beans, are they?
[02:20:43.320 --> 02:20:44.320]  No way, Bill.
[02:20:44.320 --> 02:20:46.320]  You're not going to find these beans in any grocery store.
[02:20:46.320 --> 02:20:50.320]  These are the absolute highest quality beans in the world.

[02:23:25.520 --> 02:23:27.560]  accumulated poisons from your body.

[02:07:46.000 --> 02:24:45.440]  your own hands, go to waterwebinar.com now and sign up for free to find out how
[02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:51.440]  to turn the worst water on this planet into pristine, clear drinking water.
[02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:58.600]  I mean, you can just feel this all around and you and I aren't alone.
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:01.680]  There's people that are going about their lives, they seem to be normal, they don't
[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:03.560]  seem, they're aware.
[02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:06.840]  I mean, the hair on the back of their neck is starting to stand up too.
[02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:10.040]  They don't know what to do about it other than just go to work, get some money and try
[02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:13.600]  to pay the rent for the groceries and all of that.
[02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:21.320]  But the knowledge, the sense, the anxiety, it's building, the anger, we're not on my
[02:25:21.320 --> 02:25:25.800]  minority by any stretch of the imagination.
[02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:26.800]  You just can't get people.
[02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:30.440]  You know, one of the things I saw years ago at our meetings, we had meetings for citizens
[02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:37.120]  for legal reform in Dallas and I learned that if a speaker made an important point or was
[02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:39.640]  up on the stage, I'd be in the back of the room.
[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:43.280]  The people would just sit there and they wouldn't make a move, they wouldn't say anything.
[02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:49.880]  And if I would clap my hands and just keep clapping my, they would then, then if someone
[02:25:49.880 --> 02:25:54.840]  will stand up and speak, then other people will stand up and speak also.
[02:25:54.840 --> 02:25:58.920]  But people are scared to death about being the first one to stand up and speak out.
[02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:02.460]  It's important that all of us learn to speak out.
[02:26:02.460 --> 02:26:06.920]  You will be astonished to learn how many people, you start clapping your hands, you'll
[02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:09.600]  find other people clapping their hands too.
[02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:11.600]  You will learn that you're not alone.
[02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:12.600]  Well, that's right.
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:17.040]  One person who's morally right is not a minority, you're a majority and it's all those famous
[02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:21.000]  historical examples of somebody says, who's with me to face down this enemy that's coming
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:22.480]  down the road in one hour.
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:27.640]  And first nobody stands up and then finally one person steps across the line and then
[02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:32.960]  more and then everybody steps across or one or two cowards run out the back.
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:35.760]  And it's called hitting the barbed wire.
[02:26:35.760 --> 02:26:41.760]  We, you know, that caller was asking what solutions, hit the barbed wire, hit the barbed
[02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:42.760]  wire folks.
[02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:44.440]  It's all about hitting the barbed wire.
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:47.520]  And don't be afraid that you're alone, you're not.
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:51.160]  Everyone thinks they're alone because they don't see anyone else hitting the wire.
[02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:54.600]  You hit the wire and you'll be surprised how many other people.
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:55.600]  It'll take a moment.
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:27:01.160]  They don't just move in lockstep, but as each of us steps up, more of us.
[02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:06.280]  And in my experience, the globalist almost have twisted ideas.
[02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:10.480]  When the globalist tear one of us apart or even kill one of us or destroy us, it doesn't
[02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:12.600]  really intimidate people on average.
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:14.640]  It actually enrages people.
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:18.760]  I mean, that's what Thomas Jefferson said, the blood of tyrants and patriots.
[02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:22.520]  I mean, this is not, this is for all the marbles.
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:24.760]  These people come to kill, steal and destroy.
[02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:28.760]  And people say, oh, you're doing such a great job, Alex or Alfred fighting them.
[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:30.640]  Oh, you're so, I'm not wonderful.
[02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:32.800]  I mean, I'm just aware of this.
[02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:36.440]  Once you're aware of this, the only action there is is to stand up, right?
[02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:37.480]  That's exactly right.
[02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:42.120]  Once you begin to see the injustice, it's like you used to live where the world of shades
[02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:43.120]  of gray.
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:47.080]  All of a sudden, something happens and you begin to see in color and you see the bright
[02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:48.680]  red color of injustice.
[02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:51.480]  And when you do, you can never miss it again.
[02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:52.480]  You start to see it.
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:55.320]  It was before just a shade of gray, you didn't pay any attention.
[02:27:55.320 --> 02:27:58.960]  Once you begin to see, you can't turn it off.
[02:27:58.960 --> 02:27:59.960]  You're in.
[02:27:59.960 --> 02:28:08.120]  Well, I know I've never been more alive than I am now and we're going to win this thing,
[02:28:08.120 --> 02:28:09.120]  my friend.
[02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:10.120]  We don't have a choice.
[02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:14.640]  Think about folks that spin the Bible and say it's the end of the world, lay down to
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:17.840]  evil, don't be involved, we're all going to be raptured.
[02:28:17.840 --> 02:28:22.000]  My Bible tells me those who stand firm to the end shall be saved.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:27.500]  It means my obligation is to stand firm to the end and that does not mean roll over.
[02:28:27.500 --> 02:28:32.720]  It means do what's right, even if it's not going to succeed.
[02:28:32.720 --> 02:28:35.920]  Even if you tell me they're going to shoot me tomorrow, I'm still.
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:41.560]  My obligation is to stand firm to the end and that means stand firm for righteousness.
[02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:45.280]  Now I don't, you know, I got a lot to learn about that, but still, that's what resonates
[02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:46.280]  with me.
[02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:49.360]  Well, yeah, I saw a quote the other day and I think I've said it myself just organically
[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:55.360]  in different ways, but it was from a concentration camp advisor, a survivor.
[02:28:55.360 --> 02:29:01.440]  And they said, there are some forms of victory, you know, when you persevere that even though
[02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:03.400]  you lose, you win.
[02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:04.560]  That's exactly right.
[02:29:04.560 --> 02:29:08.120]  I mean, winning in this modern world is really failure.
[02:29:08.120 --> 02:29:12.560]  Yeah, going along, being accepted by the system.
[02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:17.120]  If you're being accepted by the system, something's wrong.
[02:29:17.120 --> 02:29:20.920]  Where did you go wrong?
[02:29:20.920 --> 02:29:24.000]  Alfred Adas, because that's the best website, adas.wordpress.com.
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:25.200]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:29:25.200 --> 02:29:26.200]  That's the only one right now.
[02:29:26.200 --> 02:29:30.360]  Well, I'll say this here and now, because if I forget, and for some reason don't have
[02:29:30.360 --> 02:29:34.400]  you back on for six weeks or something, I want to have you on the TV show next week.
[02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:38.240]  Yeah, because your skype's the best I've seen, your connection.
[02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:41.240]  And I want you to be a frequent guest here on the show.
[02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:44.280]  And then I'd like you to host the show yourself sometime.
[02:29:44.280 --> 02:29:45.440]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:46.440]  Be glad to do it.
[02:29:46.440 --> 02:29:47.440]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:48.440]  You bet.
[02:29:48.440 --> 02:29:49.440]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:49.440 --> 02:29:50.440]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.440 --> 02:29:51.440]  We got one of the people arrested at Ground Zero.
[02:29:51.440 --> 02:29:52.440]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.440 --> 02:29:54.440]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.440 --> 02:29:57.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:57.440 --> 02:30:05.440]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:30:05.440 --> 02:30:06.440]  Tyranny is here.
[02:30:06.440 --> 02:30:10.520]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:30:10.520 --> 02:30:12.960]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:30:12.960 --> 02:30:17.480]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[02:30:17.480 --> 02:30:18.740]  on Earth.
[02:30:18.740 --> 02:30:23.560]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[02:30:23.560 --> 02:30:25.400]  expanded nationwide.
[02:30:25.400 --> 02:30:30.080]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[02:30:30.080 --> 02:30:31.480]  shadow state.
[02:30:31.480 --> 02:30:35.480]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:30:35.480 --> 02:30:39.960]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:45.800]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:30:45.800 --> 02:30:49.280]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:30:49.280 --> 02:30:51.320]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:30:51.320 --> 02:30:52.320]  It's here.

[02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:28.760]  Natural disasters are newsworthy, but only touch a few of us Americans.
[02:31:28.760 --> 02:31:32.400]  The huge issue of the Great Depression is on everyone's mind.
[02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:37.160]  The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses and skyrocketing food costs are
[02:31:37.160 --> 02:31:40.520]  hitting every American, so everyone needs food security.
[02:31:40.520 --> 02:31:44.000]  Folks, this month you will get free shipping on every food order from eFoodsDirect.

[02:32:00.840 --> 02:32:06.320]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important
[02:32:06.320 --> 02:32:09.040]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:32:09.040 --> 02:32:11.600]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:32:11.600 --> 02:32:15.400]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of
[02:32:15.400 --> 02:32:17.000]  your health and your own family.
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:20.000]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.360]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:32:22.360 --> 02:32:26.560]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Pannie Mae, Freddie Mac and America's biggest
[02:32:26.560 --> 02:32:28.560]  mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:32:28.560 --> 02:32:31.920]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:32:31.920 --> 02:32:36.000]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:39.200]  and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:32:39.200 --> 02:32:43.360]  I can't stress this enough, you should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:32:43.360 --> 02:32:47.600]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:32:47.600 --> 02:32:54.880]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com, that's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:32:54.880 --> 02:33:03.560]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com, that's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:33:03.560 --> 02:33:09.720]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:33:09.720 --> 02:33:12.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:12.600 --> 02:33:26.640]  One of the biggest things you can do in the Info War against the Globalist, one of the
[02:33:26.640 --> 02:33:33.080]  biggest things you can do in the Info War is visit the online video bookstore apparel
[02:33:33.080 --> 02:33:40.640]  area and buy ball caps, t-shirts, videos because the ball caps, the t-shirts get the word out
[02:33:40.640 --> 02:33:43.520]  about the websites, about ideas of liberty.
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:48.360]  People ask, what is the answer to 1984, is 1776 mean?
[02:33:48.360 --> 02:33:52.520]  Or they'll watch a film like Obama Deception or Endgame or Fall of the Republic or they'll
[02:33:52.520 --> 02:33:58.520]  see your new, with hunting season coming up, OrangeInfoWars.com baseball cap with the Don't
[02:33:58.520 --> 02:34:02.480]  Tread on Me, Snake and the Info Wars website.
[02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:04.200]  People ask, what is that?
[02:34:04.200 --> 02:34:08.720]  Or you'll meet like-minded people, the best thing is meeting like-minded people and then
[02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:13.200]  having meetings and then organizing actions that you're going to be involved in and making
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:14.200]  it fun.
[02:34:14.200 --> 02:34:20.280]  It's exciting and then starting your own web TV shows, very easy to do.
[02:34:20.280 --> 02:34:25.240]  Start your own local radio show and don't have this idea that activists are supposed
[02:34:25.240 --> 02:34:29.480]  to be failures and talk from a ditch somewhere with no money.
[02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:34.400]  Go get time on a local radio station, get sponsors, try to capitalize so that you can
[02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:38.680]  buy more air time and then do a good enough job to be offered a radio show where you
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:42.320]  get paid, then put that money into a news website.
[02:34:42.320 --> 02:34:46.840]  Again, the globalist control the issuance of currency and credit.
[02:34:46.840 --> 02:34:52.080]  But if we can just amass a little bit of funds and then use that to build the next level
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:57.680]  and then amass funds and build the next level, we have to build our own media platforms.
[02:34:57.680 --> 02:35:03.560]  The truth is popular, freedom is popular, and once you do that, now more people will
[02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:11.720]  join you and people will, the general public will respect an organization or group that
[02:35:11.720 --> 02:35:16.100]  has an organization and then the globalist can't pick us all off.
[02:35:16.100 --> 02:35:17.100]  That's another thing.
[02:35:17.100 --> 02:35:18.600]  They've tried to shut down We Are Change.
[02:35:18.600 --> 02:35:19.600]  What's We Are Change?
[02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:25.120]  Luke Radowski got kicked out of 9-11 We Are Truth, 9-11 One of the Truth groups in New
[02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:28.920]  York because he was going after the New World Order and making it political, not just about
[02:35:28.920 --> 02:35:32.760]  George Bush, but making it about the full spectrum and he was getting a lot of people
[02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:33.760]  to join.
[02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:34.760]  Very successful.
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:35.760]  They kicked him out.
[02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:37.720]  I had him on air and I didn't attack the other group.
[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:39.720]  I just said, Luke's a real leader.
[02:35:39.720 --> 02:35:40.720]  Folks should join it.
[02:35:40.720 --> 02:35:44.440]  He says, I'm calling it We Are Change and it's because it has no leadership other than
[02:35:44.440 --> 02:35:49.120]  action that no one can really infiltrate it or take it down because you can infiltrate
[02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:54.120]  or take over one chapter, but then in the same town, a new one that's real because ideas
[02:35:54.120 --> 02:35:58.880]  are bulletproof pops back up because it's leaderless resistance.
[02:35:58.880 --> 02:36:03.560]  It's led by ideas, a shared culture of freedom.
[02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:05.400]  That's what info warriors are doing.
[02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:07.160]  That's why we can't be stopped.
[02:36:07.160 --> 02:36:08.440]  You can't infiltrate.
[02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:12.560]  You can't kill Alex Jones because if you kill me, it would just energize the movement
[02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:16.240]  that much more.
[02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:20.800]  I'm just flesh and blood, but ideas, ideas are bulletproof.
[02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:24.080]  And when you realize that and you understand that when you've got the truth, it trumps
[02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:25.080]  everything else.
[02:36:25.080 --> 02:36:27.000]  It's game over.
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.280]  But people have to believe they can win.
[02:36:29.280 --> 02:36:31.240]  People have to believe they have power.
[02:36:31.240 --> 02:36:33.000]  People have to see how far we've come.
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:37.040]  Now, again, we've got this new ball cap in its orange, and I think it's almost as good
[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:40.640]  or in a way even better than the camouflage one.
[02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:46.040]  And it's available right now at infowars.com, so I hope you'll get a bunch of these orange
[02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:49.600]  caps and get them out to people that really, really turns heads while you're at it.
[02:36:49.600 --> 02:36:53.960]  Get Invisible Empire, another great documentary films that we produced and put out.
[02:36:53.960 --> 02:37:01.520]  Okay, and I'm going to get to Ken and Bill and Arnold and Michael and that, and I promise
[02:37:01.520 --> 02:37:03.440]  I'll at least get to those calls.
[02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:07.560]  I meant to read some passages from 1984, I've been trying to do this for a week, but I take
[02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:14.160]  you to Scott Holfman, who is the gentleman, and we had this video posted yesterday at
[02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:15.160]  infowars.com.
[02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:23.880]  It's now scrolled into the featured news archive of him being arrested for simply speaking
[02:37:23.880 --> 02:37:24.880]  on a street corner.
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:28.800]  They have the streets blocked off, and they're just speaking and handing out flyers.
[02:37:28.800 --> 02:37:32.240]  What a scary, tyrannical image, sir.
[02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:34.240]  Tell us what happened to you.
[02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:36.480]  Alex, what an honor to meet you.
[02:37:36.480 --> 02:37:38.760]  It's fantastic to be on your show.
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:50.000]  What happened to me is that the 9-11 propaganda event was over, and I was just so disgusted
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:38:00.880]  with how all of these poor, suffering families are being exploited by this propaganda event,
[02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:06.840]  and they're subliminally, and even overtly, they're just taking all of our pain and anguish
[02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:11.560]  and channeling it into this one point of hatred.
[02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:18.680]  Hatred for Muslims and hatred for these other terrorists that are always out there.
[02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:22.440]  My point is, what about the terrorists that are right inside of our country, and what
[02:38:22.440 --> 02:38:27.360]  about the fact that the World Trade Centers were taken down a controlled demolition?
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:31.240]  Doesn't that factor into the investigation at some point?
[02:38:31.240 --> 02:38:35.280]  How long are we going to wait around for an investigation?
[02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:42.800]  Scott, I want to go over that with you, but I want to give you the floor, so I'm not
[02:38:42.800 --> 02:38:45.720]  going to interrupt here for about four or five minutes, and we're going to be rolling
[02:38:45.720 --> 02:38:46.720]  the video.
[02:38:46.720 --> 02:38:49.520]  It's got some profanity in the background with some of the crowd, so we can't play
[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:50.520]  the audio.
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:54.160]  People can watch it at infohawarch.com, but for him and FM with FCC rules, we can't air
[02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:56.480]  the cuss words, even though they're low in the background.
[02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:00.080]  I'm going to be rolling the video while you speak about what happened to you.
[02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:01.080]  You've got the floor.
[02:39:01.080 --> 02:39:08.160]  Okay, you know, I was there, and the event ended, and my man Greg Lance, who just was
[02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:12.840]  another fellow 9-11 truth-er, happened to show up in the same spot at the same time.
[02:39:12.840 --> 02:39:14.880]  I didn't even know him.
[02:39:14.880 --> 02:39:15.880]  We met.
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:16.880]  I saw him.
[02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:17.880]  He had a shirt on.
[02:39:17.880 --> 02:39:18.880]  He said, 9-11 truth now.
[02:39:18.880 --> 02:39:23.320]  I said, hey, this is the right guy to pass my camera off to get a record of this, because
[02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:30.480]  I'm going to try to reach some people down here at Ground Zero, where all the 9-11 truthers
[02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:35.760]  that were there to protest together were barricaded off about four or five blocks away.
[02:39:35.760 --> 02:39:42.280]  I mean, it was a complete police state in action at Ground Zero.
[02:39:42.280 --> 02:39:44.800]  We were surrounded on four sides by barricade.
[02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:52.120]  We were barricaded in about maybe 3,000 people across the street, on Church Street going north,
[02:39:52.120 --> 02:39:57.680]  were barricaded in, and behind them, there was another 3,000 people barricaded in, and
[02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:05.600]  all the four sides of these blocks were just like walkways for guys with machine guns,
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:08.080]  police, white shirts.
[02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:14.880]  There were even these guys with those little CIA earpieces in with the little curly cord
[02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:19.680]  going back into their shirt, and I was like, what is going on here?
[02:40:19.680 --> 02:40:25.240]  This is such a crackdown, and nobody is just a peaceful crowd of people that come there
[02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:27.600]  to mourn for 9-11.
[02:40:27.600 --> 02:40:33.760]  Paul Simon got up there and sang his song, and I was looking at the screen and said,
[02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:37.560]  he was supposed to sing Bridge Over Troubled Water, and he decided to sing The Sound of
[02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:38.560]  Silence.
[02:40:38.560 --> 02:40:41.680]  I was listening to the word that said, well, there's one of us right up there in the middle
[02:40:41.680 --> 02:40:42.680]  of that event.
[02:40:42.680 --> 02:40:46.600]  Thank God for that, because if you listen to the words of that song, the words of the
[02:40:46.600 --> 02:40:50.880]  prophet are written on the subway wall and in the tenement halls.
[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:52.880]  That's the 9-11 truth movement.
[02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:53.880]  That's us.
[02:40:53.880 --> 02:40:57.840]  We're in the tenement halls, and we're on the subway wall, and YouTube is the subway
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:03.880]  wall of this society right now, and that's where the truth is being spoken.
[02:41:03.880 --> 02:41:10.520]  So when that event ended, and the screen went to blue, and I realized, that's it.
[02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:11.520]  It's done.
[02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:12.520]  The crowd is dispersing.
[02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:15.160]  Now I can talk because I'm not interrupting this event.
[02:41:15.160 --> 02:41:19.960]  I started talking in a loud voice, and I said, when are we going to be allowed to know the
[02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:22.240]  truth about 9-11?
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:31.720]  And I had this paper by Neil Harrett, I think that's the name right, about Sermitic explosives
[02:41:31.720 --> 02:41:34.160]  found in the depths of the World Trade Center.
[02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:37.560]  I was a little bit nervous when I started talking, so I might have gotten the title
[02:41:37.560 --> 02:41:38.560]  wrong.
[02:41:38.560 --> 02:41:45.960]  I mean, it's not easy just starting to speak out openly in a crowd that big where there's
[02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:49.560]  virtually nobody there to stand with me.
[02:41:49.560 --> 02:41:55.800]  But you know what, I said, there probably are a lot of people here that know the truth
[02:41:55.800 --> 02:42:02.920]  about 9-11, and that's where my faith is, is that New York City knows the truth.
[02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:08.080]  I've been out there talking about 9-11 truth for years, and what I find is that pretty
[02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:10.640]  much everybody knows by now.
[02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:11.640]  Pretty much everybody.
[02:42:11.640 --> 02:42:18.880]  There's only certain people who have a certain conflict of interest in their daily life,
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:24.920]  which keeps them from either looking at the evidence or keeps them from embracing it.
[02:42:24.920 --> 02:42:28.960]  If they do look at it, like my father, who's an engineer, and he was in the World Trade
[02:42:28.960 --> 02:42:33.960]  Center when that plane hit, he was in Tower 2, he almost died that day, and he was able
[02:42:33.960 --> 02:42:34.960]  to escape.
[02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:40.400]  He ran through the rubble, had to climb over bodies, and he had to carry a body down the
[02:42:40.400 --> 02:42:42.080]  staircase on his way out.
[02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:47.120]  We couldn't find him all day, and he's traumatized from that.
[02:42:47.120 --> 02:42:50.360]  I have a reason to be there, too.
[02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:57.640]  This guy walked up to me, the guy that's shouting the profanities, by the way, and being aggressive,
[02:42:57.640 --> 02:43:04.680]  and being violent, and being super confrontational, and he told me that I wasn't welcome there.
[02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:05.680]  You know what?
[02:43:05.680 --> 02:43:08.200]  Freedom of speech is a constitutional right.
[02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:12.600]  I don't need to be welcomed there by you or anybody else.
[02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:18.800]  I have a right to be there, and the fact that the majority of people in that crowd, I can
[02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:25.680]  guarantee you, are aware of not a living truth, and want to hear it, and we're actually stopping
[02:43:25.680 --> 02:43:30.920]  and listening, like, peaceably, if you look at the video carefully, you can see that some
[02:43:30.920 --> 02:43:32.600]  people are slowing down.
[02:43:32.600 --> 02:43:39.240]  One woman is crushing me, and this other guy starts, like, exploding in rage.
[02:43:39.240 --> 02:43:45.080]  And these people are clearly totally ignorant about liberty, totally ignorant about freedom,
[02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:51.760]  Scott, and, you know, watching the video of you be drug-a-wayed by the police.
[02:43:51.760 --> 02:43:56.480]  If anybody should have been arrested for disorderly conduct, it's the guy that's starting a fight
[02:43:56.480 --> 02:44:00.720]  with you and cussing an aggressive and in-your-face, and he still shouldn't have been arrested.
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:04.760]  He should have just been pushed back, and the cops took you to jail.
[02:44:04.760 --> 02:44:07.560]  Now, tell us, after you're putting the police car, after you're-
[02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:09.240]  We didn't do it, huh?
[02:44:09.240 --> 02:44:13.440]  After you're putting the police car, though, what did the police say anything to you?
[02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:17.240]  Did you tell them, shame on you, disgracing your oath of office?
[02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:19.240]  Well, no, I didn't.
[02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:20.240]  You know why?
[02:44:20.240 --> 02:44:26.400]  Because the New York City Police Department is also very aware of not a living truth.
[02:44:26.400 --> 02:44:29.960]  It took me about an hour to get to a police car.
[02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:32.240]  They kept me there.
[02:44:32.240 --> 02:44:36.480]  You only see, like, bits and pieces of the video, but I was standing out there in the
[02:44:36.480 --> 02:44:42.960]  middle of a barricaded street for at least a half an hour, and during that entire time,
[02:44:42.960 --> 02:44:47.880]  I never stopped talking to this crowd of police officers that were around.
[02:44:47.880 --> 02:44:53.360]  And surprisingly, I mean, it would be, I think it's surprising to a lot of people, it wasn't
[02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:57.560]  surprising to me, because I've been doing this for a while, the police officers wanted
[02:44:57.560 --> 02:45:01.160]  to know, they were actually asking me for the websites to look up to find out.
[02:45:01.160 --> 02:45:04.800]  No, I know, I've had police, firemen, and masks come over and say, we know, we know.
[02:45:04.800 --> 02:45:07.200]  The question is, then why did they arrest you?
[02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:08.200]  Why did they follow that order?
[02:45:08.200 --> 02:45:09.680]  I was never given a reason.
[02:45:09.680 --> 02:45:15.280]  They never, I asked them that many times on the way to the police car, I asked them that,
[02:45:15.280 --> 02:45:18.920]  when they first accosted me, I said, why are you doing this?
[02:45:18.920 --> 02:45:22.240]  You can't hear it on the video, I said, why am I being arrested?
[02:45:22.240 --> 02:45:25.680]  And they didn't say anything, they just grabbed me and dragged me out.
[02:45:25.680 --> 02:45:29.280]  And then another guy shouted from the crowd, Greg, who was filming, he said, why are you,
[02:45:29.280 --> 02:45:31.120]  why are they being arrested?
[02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:34.720]  And then I turned around again, I said, yeah, why am I being arrested?
[02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:39.480]  And they, they just never, they just, they, they told me to shut up a couple of times.
[02:45:39.480 --> 02:45:44.160]  They said, they said, later on, about five minutes later, after I was put in the police
[02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:48.160]  car, I asked, so why exactly is it that I'm being arrested?
[02:45:48.160 --> 02:45:53.320]  And this guy, I think it was the rookie who said, because you resisted.
[02:45:53.320 --> 02:45:56.040]  And I'm like, well, you know, resisted what?
[02:45:56.040 --> 02:45:58.440]  Resisted arrest, what am I being arrested for?
[02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:02.560]  I have a right to resist being bullied around by police officers.
[02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:08.000]  You have a right to continue to speak on a street corner in America.
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:14.000]  I mean, it's so fundamental in the fact that all over the country now, they arrest you.
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:18.920]  I mean, that's always been Americana, whether it's an old crazy guy saying the end is near
[02:46:18.920 --> 02:46:25.240]  or whether it's, it's, it's, it's somebody, you know, they're, you know, advertising that
[02:46:25.240 --> 02:46:27.440]  there's a pizza shop down the road.
[02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:31.160]  This fundamental right is under assault.
[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:33.280]  Do they charge you with anything?
[02:46:33.280 --> 02:46:35.120]  They charged me in the end.
[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:37.640]  They finally charged me with disorderly conduct.
[02:46:37.640 --> 02:46:39.280]  Can I just add something?
[02:46:39.280 --> 02:46:44.400]  You know, the KKK is a known terrorist organization and they march in America.
[02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:48.160]  They have the right to speak whenever they want to.
[02:46:48.160 --> 02:46:50.040]  And this is, this is insane.
[02:46:50.040 --> 02:46:51.200]  By the way, that's a good point.
[02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:57.760]  I noticed that they let that group go to funerals and, and, and, and scream at the families.
[02:46:57.760 --> 02:47:02.560]  But then I'm seeing more and more examples of where like mainline reasonable groups are
[02:47:02.560 --> 02:47:03.800]  being arrested.
[02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:07.280]  And so it's almost like they let the really wild people speak to make First Amendment look
[02:47:07.280 --> 02:47:10.280]  bad and then go after everybody else.
[02:47:10.280 --> 02:47:11.280]  Right.
[02:47:11.280 --> 02:47:13.400]  And, um, no, God, I lost my part.
[02:47:13.400 --> 02:47:14.400]  What was I going to say?
[02:47:14.400 --> 02:47:15.400]  KKK.
[02:47:15.400 --> 02:47:17.400]  Well, no, not exactly the KKK.
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:19.600]  I kind of lost my train of thought there.
[02:47:19.600 --> 02:47:23.720]  You were saying they let a known terrorist group march in America because it's their
[02:47:23.720 --> 02:47:25.720]  First Amendment, but.
[02:47:25.720 --> 02:47:31.040]  Well, I mean, it's just that I wasn't saying anything inflammatory.
[02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:32.040]  That's the point.
[02:47:32.040 --> 02:47:33.040]  That's the, that's the point.
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:35.000]  But even if you were, it's free speech.
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:39.440]  I mean, we're getting into this mode of anything that hurts somebody's feelings you can't say
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:40.440]  in America.
[02:47:40.440 --> 02:47:42.320]  Oh, well, I remember what I wanted to say.
[02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:50.520]  They use this rubric of respecting the families as a way to create a shroud of silence that
[02:47:50.520 --> 02:47:53.720]  you're not supposed to break at ground zero during 9-11.
[02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:54.720]  Okay.
[02:47:54.720 --> 02:48:01.320]  If you speak about anything except what they have authorized, then you are disrespecting
[02:48:01.320 --> 02:48:03.320]  the families of 9-11.
[02:48:03.320 --> 02:48:04.840]  Well, you know what?
[02:48:04.840 --> 02:48:09.120]  I think that we're respecting the families when we demand to know the truth about who
[02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:10.600]  killed these people.
[02:48:10.600 --> 02:48:11.760]  Well, that's right.
[02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:16.840]  Look, look, look, look at how they wrapped themselves in the first responders heroism.
[02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:20.480]  But because so many of them are mad about the dust and the inside job, they're not welcome
[02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:21.480]  at ground zero.
[02:48:21.480 --> 02:48:23.560]  I mean, look, they're scared.
[02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:25.880]  That's why there was so much security this year.
[02:48:25.880 --> 02:48:30.800]  That's why they block people back for miles because they know we know.
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:35.680]  And they're desperate to resurrect the myth of 9-11 to use it again, Scott.
[02:48:35.680 --> 02:48:36.680]  That's right.
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:39.760]  I think they're afraid of a massive uprising in New York.
[02:48:39.760 --> 02:48:46.240]  And I was probably the person that they feared most at that point, a person who was among
[02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:47.240]  the masses.
[02:48:47.240 --> 02:48:54.720]  And I was not barricaded off screaming like a lunatic where they've got you basically
[02:48:54.720 --> 02:49:02.120]  in a pen, a cage, and you really look like a lunatic when you're inside of a cage protesting.
[02:49:02.120 --> 02:49:07.880]  So I say to the 9-11 truthers, get out of the cage, get among the masses again, get
[02:49:07.880 --> 02:49:11.560]  in places where you're not supposed to be and start talking about it.
[02:49:11.560 --> 02:49:15.280]  Now, Luke Rudowski, he confronted Larry Silverstein on 9-11.
[02:49:15.280 --> 02:49:17.800]  I've got to take my hat off for that guy.
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:19.560]  He's got some cojones, you know?
[02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:22.640]  Luke's done it over and over and over and over again.
[02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:25.600]  The guy that says he blew up building 7.
[02:49:25.600 --> 02:49:27.000]  Tell us about this latest one.
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:28.000]  What do you mean?
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.120]  Tell you about what?
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:31.680]  The latest Silverstein confrontation.
[02:49:31.680 --> 02:49:34.960]  Well, it's on YouTube.
[02:49:34.960 --> 02:49:41.080]  He asked Larry Silverstein about some of the details of his statements, such as the one
[02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:43.680]  where he gave the order to pull it.
[02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:47.280]  Larry Silverstein was just ridiculously evasive.
[02:49:47.280 --> 02:49:49.760]  Well, he's just confronted him like a week ago.
[02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:50.760]  You mean he's done it again?
[02:49:50.760 --> 02:49:52.640]  Well, was that a week ago?
[02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:53.640]  I thought it was today.
[02:49:53.640 --> 02:49:54.640]  I thought it was on 9-11.
[02:49:54.640 --> 02:49:55.640]  No, it might have been.
[02:49:55.640 --> 02:49:56.640]  He's confronting him all the time.
[02:49:56.640 --> 02:49:59.200]  By the way, Luke, you know, his family gets death threats too.
[02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:00.200]  Luke's got a lot of courage.
[02:50:00.200 --> 02:50:04.400]  Have you seen the footage of the cops and the goons coming over and saying his camera's
[02:50:04.400 --> 02:50:06.680]  a gun and we're going to put you in jail for terrorism?
[02:50:06.680 --> 02:50:07.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:50:07.680 --> 02:50:08.680]  We're going to lock you up.
[02:50:08.680 --> 02:50:09.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:50:09.680 --> 02:50:10.680]  I remember that.
[02:50:10.680 --> 02:50:11.680]  Yes, who's going to jail?
[02:50:11.680 --> 02:50:12.680]  Right, right, right.
[02:50:12.680 --> 02:50:16.680]  I know you're not a terrorist, but you're going to be in the hole for 30 days, eh?
[02:50:16.680 --> 02:50:17.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:50:17.680 --> 02:50:21.320]  I'm really proud to be in America when I got people like that in this country.
[02:50:21.320 --> 02:50:23.760]  Well, you need to obviously fight this.
[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:28.320]  Where's the best website for folks to visit or for people to get in contact with you or
[02:50:28.320 --> 02:50:29.320]  lawyers or whatever?
[02:50:29.320 --> 02:50:33.320]  I think you should sue them for false imprisonment, violation of your constitutional rights, civil
[02:50:33.320 --> 02:50:34.320]  right violation.
[02:50:34.320 --> 02:50:35.320]  Well, you know what?
[02:50:35.320 --> 02:50:39.480]  I'm going to, I'm going to risk, I mean, can I give out my email because I don't really
[02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:40.480]  have a website.
[02:50:40.480 --> 02:50:41.480]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:50:41.480 --> 02:50:42.480]  Give it up.
[02:50:42.480 --> 02:50:45.880]  What I'm going to say, the website to get in touch with is We Are Changed, New York
[02:50:45.880 --> 02:50:46.880]  City, okay?
[02:50:46.880 --> 02:50:52.160]  That's the main website, you know, I'm, I'm a, I'm a sort of, you know, a weekend warrior
[02:50:52.160 --> 02:50:53.160]  with those.
[02:50:53.160 --> 02:50:54.160]  No, I understand.
[02:50:54.160 --> 02:50:56.520]  It's just, it's just that Luke says that site's been having problems.
[02:50:56.520 --> 02:50:57.520]  Stay there.
[02:50:57.520 --> 02:51:00.320]  We'll briefly try to get people your contact and I'll take a few phone calls.

[02:51:30.880 --> 02:51:32.240]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:51:32.240 --> 02:51:35.960]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[02:51:35.960 --> 02:51:36.960]  IRAs?
[02:51:36.960 --> 02:51:41.000]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:42.680]  of gold for your retirement.
[02:51:42.680 --> 02:51:46.200]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[02:51:46.200 --> 02:51:51.200]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:51:51.200 --> 02:51:57.040]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.

[02:52:01.200 --> 02:52:05.600]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involve substantial
[02:52:05.600 --> 02:52:06.940]  capital and risk.
[02:52:06.940 --> 02:52:10.160]  Your info wars team dot com operation is different.

[02:53:01.960 --> 02:53:06.440]  Consumer rights as individuals to freely purchase dietary supplements over the counter are under
[02:53:06.440 --> 02:53:07.640]  constant attack.
[02:53:07.640 --> 02:53:12.200]  The globalists want to ban all supplements formulated after 1994.
[02:53:12.200 --> 02:53:16.200]  Governments are hoarding raw materials, affecting our ability to purchase these products at
[02:53:16.200 --> 02:53:17.680]  a reasonable price.
[02:53:17.680 --> 02:53:22.680]  Even organic foods are stripped of nutrients due to overuse of soil and compromised growing
[02:53:22.680 --> 02:53:23.680]  conditions.
[02:53:23.680 --> 02:53:27.720]  Storeable foods are essential, but you also need to make sure you have the nutrients you
[02:53:27.720 --> 02:53:30.120]  need to stay healthy during emergencies.
[02:53:30.120 --> 02:53:36.160]  Go to survivalrx.com today and see the amazing line of storeable supplements they have to
[02:53:36.160 --> 02:53:37.800]  protect the ones you love.
[02:53:37.800 --> 02:53:43.560]  The owners of survivalrx.com have been in sports nutrition for over a decade and they
[02:53:43.560 --> 02:53:47.040]  realize the need for long term storeable vitamins.
[02:53:47.040 --> 02:53:51.840]  The result is a triple nitrogen flushing method, which allows these vitamins to maintain their
[02:53:51.840 --> 02:53:53.360]  strength for decades.
[02:53:53.360 --> 02:54:05.400]  Again, go to survivalrx.com at survivalrx.com.
[02:54:05.400 --> 02:54:13.720]  Sending out an SOS, a message in the bottle, got some hardcore criminals running our society,
[02:54:13.720 --> 02:54:16.400]  being naive is empowered them, it's time to wake up and say no.
[02:54:16.400 --> 02:54:22.960]  Now I'm going to go to Ken and Michael and Adam at least, we'll do a little bit of overdrive
[02:54:22.960 --> 02:54:28.320]  that I'm on the TV tonight, 7 o'clock at prisonplanet.tv with M4 Wars Nightly News,
[02:54:28.320 --> 02:54:30.200]  if you're not a member, please become one.
[02:54:30.200 --> 02:54:35.800]  But Scott Holtman was just pointing out to me the police should have been there protecting
[02:54:35.800 --> 02:54:39.640]  his First Amendment, not arresting him.
[02:54:39.640 --> 02:54:42.920]  And the state of Texas has tried to arrest people for peacefully speaking and has lost
[02:54:42.920 --> 02:54:44.480]  a lot of lawsuits.
[02:54:44.480 --> 02:54:48.800]  New York has lost thousands over this and uses taxpayer money to pay them.
[02:54:48.800 --> 02:54:53.440]  This paid tens of millions last time I checked, just from the RNC.
[02:54:53.440 --> 02:55:00.920]  They don't care, they're really, I mean Bloomberg is a monster, I mean this is like something
[02:55:00.920 --> 02:55:04.680]  out of China, so where's Amnesty International?
[02:55:04.680 --> 02:55:06.240]  This is wrong.
[02:55:06.240 --> 02:55:12.680]  Now you guys are having a flash mob of a media personality who's always out there whitewashing.
[02:55:12.680 --> 02:55:17.960]  I think it's better to announce where you're going to be and let the cops be there en masse
[02:55:17.960 --> 02:55:19.840]  and let it be a big circus.
[02:55:19.840 --> 02:55:21.720]  That's how you're going to get attention.
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:25.280]  But if you don't want to tell people who the target of your First Amendment information
[02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:27.640]  warfare is, that's fine.
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:32.040]  It's your choice, Scott, but give people the corner and where you're meeting in two days.
[02:55:32.040 --> 02:55:38.200]  Okay, we're going to have basically a flash mob to confront a, it's going to be a peaceful
[02:55:38.200 --> 02:55:43.800]  confrontation with a high level mainstream media operative who is always whitewashing
[02:55:43.800 --> 02:55:51.800]  9-11, but who has, who has on the record admitted that 9-11 does need to be reinvestigated.
[02:55:51.800 --> 02:55:59.040]  And we're going to meet at the corner of West 27th and 10th Avenue at between 6.30 a.m.
[02:55:59.040 --> 02:56:00.040]  and 7 a.m.
[02:56:00.040 --> 02:56:01.560]  That's the gathering time.
[02:56:01.560 --> 02:56:07.240]  It's right at the front of Chelsea Park on the corner of West 27th and 10th.
[02:56:07.240 --> 02:56:13.040]  We are, change is going to be a part of this and I encourage all 9-11 truthers, whether
[02:56:13.040 --> 02:56:17.920]  you've been at ground zero or not, if you believe in the truth, to be there because
[02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:22.880]  this is going to be a peaceful confrontation and we're going to demand that this journalist
[02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:25.440]  live up to their ex-
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:29.720]  Now, what this whitewasher does is when she doesn't think there's any viewers, she'll
[02:56:29.720 --> 02:56:33.600]  say, yeah, building 7's suspicious because she was there when it blew up and ran away
[02:56:33.600 --> 02:56:34.600]  when I told her to get back.
[02:56:34.600 --> 02:56:35.600]  She's an eyewitness to it.
[02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:42.720]  It's on tape, but when she's on her own show, it's like, no, Chomsky, tell me how Al
[02:56:42.720 --> 02:56:43.720]  Qaeda is real.
[02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:44.720]  Okay.
[02:56:44.720 --> 02:56:47.360]  Hey, listen, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:48.360]  God bless you.
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:52.000]  And also the great guy that shot the video to document it, Scott Holtman.
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:53.000]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:54.000]  Yeah.
[02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:55.000]  Yeah.
[02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:56.000]  That was Greg Lance.
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:57.000]  Thanks.
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:58.000]  Thanks to everybody for being there.
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:56:59.000]  All right.
[02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:00.000]  Thank you, brother.
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:01.000]  God bless you, man.
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:02.000]  Wonderful, wonderful news.
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:03.320]  I think he was saying, oh, Greg Lance, he's from We Are Change.
[02:57:03.320 --> 02:57:04.320]  Where'd you say?
[02:57:04.320 --> 02:57:05.320]  Carolina.
[02:57:05.320 --> 02:57:06.320]  Carolina.
[02:57:06.320 --> 02:57:07.320]  People should check that out.
[02:57:07.320 --> 02:57:08.320]  Thank you so much.
[02:57:08.320 --> 02:57:09.320]  All right.
[02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:10.320]  I want to jam in some calls here.
[02:57:10.320 --> 02:57:11.320]  I'll be back tonight.
[02:57:11.320 --> 02:57:15.640]  We've got some really big reports with a lot of work on internet censorship and kill switches
[02:57:15.640 --> 02:57:21.440]  and control, government drug dealing tonight with some new developments, solar flare dangers.
[02:57:21.440 --> 02:57:24.440]  Even the government says the biggest ever recorded are coming this way and have already
[02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:28.160]  knocked out power in major U.S. cities last week, but it's just been a minor footnote.
[02:57:28.160 --> 02:57:29.760]  I'm going to worry about something real.
[02:57:29.760 --> 02:57:31.600]  It ain't Al Qaeda folks.
[02:57:31.600 --> 02:57:36.000]  It's it's it's it's it's mother nature.
[02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:37.720]  Ken in Texas has been holding for a while.
[02:57:37.720 --> 02:57:38.720]  Go ahead, Ken.
[02:57:38.720 --> 02:57:42.920]  Mark Telgunner in the official radio show.
[02:57:42.920 --> 02:57:43.920]  Great show today, Alex.
[02:57:43.920 --> 02:57:45.360]  I appreciate you letting me on.
[02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:46.360]  Thank you.
[02:57:46.360 --> 02:57:47.360]  Thank you.
[02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:50.200]  Just, you know, after I was talking about books that everybody should have, regardless
[02:57:50.200 --> 02:57:55.000]  of your religious affiliation, the one book that you should have is Black's Law Dictionary.
[02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:56.000]  Yes.
[02:57:56.000 --> 02:58:03.840]  Because that's the only way you're going to figure it out.
[02:58:03.840 --> 02:58:12.040]  It was used for state and national propaganda and had my picture.
[02:58:12.040 --> 02:58:13.200]  Your phone's breaking up, sir.
[02:58:13.200 --> 02:58:14.920]  You said something about state propaganda.
[02:58:14.920 --> 02:58:16.760]  I think somebody's calling you.
[02:58:16.760 --> 02:58:18.760]  Let's try that.
[02:58:18.760 --> 02:58:19.760]  Is that better?
[02:58:19.760 --> 02:58:20.760]  Yeah.
[02:58:20.760 --> 02:58:21.760]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:58:21.760 --> 02:58:26.000]  I was used for state and national propaganda, had my picture taken with Dr. Jonas Salk.
[02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:31.600]  My dad was a part of the industrial military complex and then got out running with the
[02:58:31.600 --> 02:58:32.600]  alphabet agencies.
[02:58:32.600 --> 02:58:34.280]  And they basically scared the hell out of me.
[02:58:34.280 --> 02:58:35.280]  Stay there.
[02:58:35.280 --> 02:58:36.280]  I want to come back to you.
[02:58:36.280 --> 02:58:37.280]  This sounds riveting.
[02:58:37.280 --> 02:58:40.280]  Internet only, infowars.com, president Blana.tv coming up.
[02:58:40.280 --> 02:58:46.320]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.320 --> 02:58:52.720]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:58:52.720 --> 02:58:57.240]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:58:57.240 --> 02:59:01.200]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming and I think it's important for my
[02:59:01.200 --> 02:59:03.960]  listeners to do three things right away.
[02:59:03.960 --> 02:59:06.360]  Number one, study the past.
[02:59:06.360 --> 02:59:08.640]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:59:08.640 --> 02:59:13.480]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:59:13.480 --> 02:59:16.320]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:59:16.320 --> 02:59:20.400]  A perfect storm is brewing or a global food crisis.
[02:59:20.400 --> 02:59:25.560]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices Empty Shelves, warning
[02:59:25.560 --> 02:59:29.480]  signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:59:29.480 --> 02:59:32.800]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:59:32.800 --> 02:59:37.280]  This book is only available at RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com.
[02:59:37.280 --> 02:59:41.120]  You'll also get a free copy of supermarket survival, how to cut your grocery bills in
[02:59:41.120 --> 02:59:42.120]  half.
[02:59:42.120 --> 02:59:46.880]  Again, that website is RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com.
[02:59:46.880 --> 02:59:52.320]  That's RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com.
[02:59:52.320 --> 02:59:55.960]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.960 --> 03:00:02.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:02.960 --> 03:00:21.080]  All right, we were talking to, we're talking to Ken in Texas, weren't we?
[03:00:21.080 --> 03:00:28.680]  Yeah, and he was saying, yeah, Dr. Salk, the loving polio vaccine guy, one of his big associates
[03:00:28.680 --> 03:00:31.840]  on CBC TV admitted, yeah, we put the cancer viruses in there.
[03:00:31.840 --> 03:00:34.480]  Yeah, it killed a hundred million people, big deal.
[03:00:34.480 --> 03:00:38.320]  But you were talking about your family got out of this, then you got threatened.
[03:00:38.320 --> 03:00:39.320]  Go ahead.
[03:00:39.320 --> 03:00:43.880]  Well, my dad gave me the red pill at eight.
[03:00:43.880 --> 03:00:47.840]  I mean, he told me everything that was going to happen.
[03:00:47.840 --> 03:00:52.240]  And you know, so you fight it, and then they come after you and you go and you hide.
[03:00:52.240 --> 03:00:54.560]  And you have that fear.
[03:00:54.560 --> 03:00:59.520]  And I got sick of it, said no more.
[03:00:59.520 --> 03:01:02.520]  And so I went to work for the globalists.
[03:01:02.520 --> 03:01:10.600]  And I went to work for a very high level one, and I learned how to double, triple and quadruple
[03:01:10.600 --> 03:01:11.600]  businesses.
[03:01:11.600 --> 03:01:15.480]  I don't care if they're at $500,000 or a billion dollars in sales.
[03:01:15.480 --> 03:01:18.600]  And I learned the strategies.
[03:01:18.600 --> 03:01:26.640]  And the problem I'm going to give some constructive criticism here is most people that listen to
[03:01:26.640 --> 03:01:28.480]  you hear what you say.
[03:01:28.480 --> 03:01:30.560]  They understand it intellectually.
[03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:32.280]  They agree with you.
[03:01:32.280 --> 03:01:34.320]  They know it's the right thing to do.
[03:01:34.320 --> 03:01:36.000]  And then they do nothing.
[03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:37.000]  Why?
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:43.040]  Because I'm not probably giving them easy ways to do things because I know that if I just
[03:01:43.040 --> 03:01:47.920]  said, do this simple thing, it actually wouldn't be a solution and be a solution to make this
[03:01:47.920 --> 03:01:49.520]  show bigger.
[03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:53.320]  But I want people to think on their own and come up with different ideas to attack in
[03:01:53.320 --> 03:01:54.800]  different directions.
[03:01:54.800 --> 03:01:58.800]  And out of that, it'll be an attack pattern that the globalists can't stop.
[03:01:58.800 --> 03:02:04.120]  No, I understand that, but knowledge is not power.
[03:02:04.120 --> 03:02:05.120]  Action is power.
[03:02:05.120 --> 03:02:07.400]  Knowledge acted upon as power.
[03:02:07.400 --> 03:02:08.400]  Yes.
[03:02:08.400 --> 03:02:11.200]  And the problem is you say we're in an info war and it's not true.
[03:02:11.200 --> 03:02:14.120]  We're in a psychological war.
[03:02:14.120 --> 03:02:15.600]  This is psych ops.
[03:02:15.600 --> 03:02:16.600]  Okay.
[03:02:16.600 --> 03:02:23.240]  This is power of influence and 99% of our side is tactical.
[03:02:23.240 --> 03:02:30.920]  And being strategic, I will slaughter you every single time because I'm five steps ahead.
[03:02:30.920 --> 03:02:35.440]  And the passion on our side is compelling.
[03:02:35.440 --> 03:02:37.440]  Our persuasion sucks.
[03:02:37.440 --> 03:02:44.320]  Yeah, well, I don't ever think of myself as having all the answers and, you know, it's
[03:02:44.320 --> 03:02:45.320]  more than that.
[03:02:45.320 --> 03:02:49.120]  I tell people who think they're working for the dark side and winning that they're not
[03:02:49.120 --> 03:02:50.120]  winning.
[03:02:50.120 --> 03:02:54.120]  And so hopefully people will see that and think about it, not because I told them that
[03:02:54.120 --> 03:02:55.120]  they already knew that.
[03:02:55.120 --> 03:02:57.640]  I'm just reminding people like a door chime.
[03:02:57.640 --> 03:02:59.600]  Hey, the door just got opened.
[03:02:59.600 --> 03:03:01.440]  You can get out of this.
[03:03:01.440 --> 03:03:03.000]  This is not a good place.
[03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:07.400]  Everybody's going here acting off of manipulation and deception.
[03:03:07.400 --> 03:03:08.720]  We've got two minutes left.
[03:03:08.720 --> 03:03:10.560]  Tell us what we should do then.
[03:03:10.560 --> 03:03:12.880]  Ideas from your experience that have been effective.
[03:03:12.880 --> 03:03:16.480]  Well, I know that you have the research.
[03:03:16.480 --> 03:03:23.800]  We have to come up with a way to package it properly so that we can open more eyes because
[03:03:23.800 --> 03:03:25.800]  we don't have time.
[03:03:25.800 --> 03:03:29.280]  We don't have 20 more years for everybody to wait around and all of a sudden the light
[03:03:29.280 --> 03:03:35.160]  bell goes off and they all they do is reframe everything and it's time for us to take our
[03:03:35.160 --> 03:03:40.840]  own psychological operations and put the information so that people can see it sooner
[03:03:40.840 --> 03:03:46.600]  so that instead of, you know, we quadruple your organization and then get people mobilized
[03:03:46.600 --> 03:03:51.480]  because they can see it and then they can articulate it not necessarily in an argumentative mode
[03:03:51.480 --> 03:03:55.280]  so that more people will receive it.
[03:03:55.280 --> 03:03:59.560]  Yeah, I've talked to a lot of people and they say if you craft things or whatever, understand
[03:03:59.560 --> 03:04:03.880]  the globalist and they just flip names, repackage falsely.
[03:04:03.880 --> 03:04:08.080]  I mean, my mission is just to get people to realize there's manipulation going on and
[03:04:08.080 --> 03:04:10.480]  to look at it for themselves.
[03:04:10.480 --> 03:04:13.880]  And I think we've been some of the most successful people out there overall.
[03:04:13.880 --> 03:04:17.080]  So, I mean, I don't think there's, you know, silver bullets.
[03:04:17.080 --> 03:04:22.800]  I think it's easier for, you know, the power structure to do big things because it has
[03:04:22.800 --> 03:04:25.600]  the unlimited false capital.
[03:04:25.600 --> 03:04:27.800]  So don't ever underestimate that.
[03:04:27.800 --> 03:04:35.760]  No, not at all, but with what you've got, repackaged with a cup, you know, one word
[03:04:35.760 --> 03:04:41.320]  turns a campaign from being a failure into a massive success.
[03:04:41.320 --> 03:04:43.320]  Okay, but I mean, what word?
[03:04:43.320 --> 03:04:45.320]  Survival of the human species?
[03:04:45.320 --> 03:04:46.320]  No, no, no, no.
[03:04:46.320 --> 03:04:47.320]  Hope change?
[03:04:47.320 --> 03:04:51.520]  It's something, it's something, but I'm telling you, now's the time.
[03:04:51.520 --> 03:04:54.280]  I'd be willing to help.
[03:04:54.280 --> 03:04:59.240]  I'll have John Harmon give you one of our emails, send me some of your ideas with your
[03:04:59.240 --> 03:05:24.520]  email, send it right now.
