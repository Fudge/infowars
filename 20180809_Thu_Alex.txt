[00:00.000 --> 00:13.040]  Political outrage turns bloody in Berkeley.
[00:13.040 --> 00:18.320]  Our KPIX 5 crews were right in the middle of the chaos as both Trump supporters and
[00:18.320 --> 00:23.360]  anti-Trump activists come to blows.
[00:23.360 --> 00:27.440]  Protesters followed Trump supporters to their cars as they left the convention center, around
[00:27.440 --> 00:32.000]  the corner and away from police protection on St. Carlo Street, a mob mentality took
[00:32.000 --> 00:33.000]  over.
[00:33.000 --> 00:39.440]  What do you say to the people who are, who dragged a poor white guy out of a car and
[00:39.440 --> 00:40.440]  beat him?
[00:40.440 --> 00:42.640]  Oh my goodness, poor white people, please, all my stuff.
[00:42.640 --> 00:44.640]  These were pure attacks.
[00:44.640 --> 00:49.920]  Trump supporters, men, women, even the elderly, left this building last night and walked right
[00:49.920 --> 00:50.920]  into danger.
[00:50.920 --> 00:55.440]  This Trump supporter was the first casualty of the day, with blood streaming out of his
[00:55.440 --> 00:56.440]  face.
[00:56.440 --> 00:58.440]  Trump vented anti-Trump protesters got into it.
[00:58.440 --> 01:01.440]  They're throwing things at the guy who has a Trump shirt on.
[01:01.440 --> 01:06.440]  Oh, he just got knocked in the back of the head and he just got punched in the face.
[01:06.440 --> 01:09.440]  And now they're rushing it.
[01:09.440 --> 01:12.440]  What is this?
[01:12.440 --> 01:14.440]  I don't know.
[01:14.440 --> 01:16.440]  What is this?
[01:16.440 --> 01:19.440]  I don't know.
[01:19.440 --> 01:24.040]  We're saying if you're out there and you're trying to represent your First Amendment right
[01:24.040 --> 01:29.040]  to free speech, if somebody comes and attacks you, it's your right to defend yourself.
[01:29.040 --> 01:30.680]  It got ugly.
[01:30.680 --> 01:37.440]  Violence erupting at the event is fight, broke out, fifth, flying between Trump supporters
[01:37.440 --> 01:39.520]  and anti-Trump supporters.
[01:39.520 --> 01:40.520]  It gets pretty ugly.
[01:40.520 --> 01:44.040]  Yeah, I want to warn the folks watching at home, you're about to see some very violent
[01:44.040 --> 01:45.040]  footage.
[01:45.040 --> 01:46.040]  Do you want to fight?
[01:46.040 --> 01:47.040]  Give them a lift.
[01:47.040 --> 01:48.040]  You got one.
[01:48.040 --> 01:49.040]  What is this?
[01:49.040 --> 01:55.840]  Organizers say today's rallies were meant as a show of unity against what they call a
[01:55.840 --> 02:00.040]  seditious fringe allegedly trying to sabotage the president.
[02:00.040 --> 02:06.040]  You can see there a FedEx delivery driver jumping in to try to put an end to the protest.
[02:06.040 --> 02:07.040]  You don't like it?
[02:07.040 --> 02:08.040]  You don't like it?
[02:08.040 --> 02:09.040]  Get the f*** out of here.
[02:09.040 --> 02:10.040]  Let's just shrink the numbers.
[02:10.040 --> 02:11.040]  I'll give you a take.
[02:11.040 --> 02:12.040]  Lifts you want to come at.
[02:12.040 --> 02:15.040]  Give everybody a hundred of you against one of me because that's what it's going to take.
[02:15.040 --> 02:20.040]  You don't know this.
[02:20.040 --> 02:25.040]  You got fed?
[02:25.040 --> 02:37.040]  This is the heart of 1776.
[02:37.040 --> 02:41.360]  The reason we're banned, the reason we're censored, the reason we're being shut down is we expose
[02:41.360 --> 02:44.840]  that the Chai comms have basically taken control of Silicon Valley.
[02:44.840 --> 02:46.840]  It's now mainstream news and they've panicked.
[02:46.840 --> 02:49.840]  I got another report we're writing that's going to go to the president next Tuesday.
[02:49.840 --> 02:55.840]  It's going to go right into his hands about how you're doing it and how it can be stopped.
[02:55.840 --> 02:57.840]  So good luck thinking you shut us down.
[02:57.840 --> 02:59.840]  You walked right into our trap.
[02:59.840 --> 03:01.840]  Now, here's why they're so upset.
[03:01.840 --> 03:07.840]  The country's coming back from the dead.
[03:07.840 --> 03:12.840]  Nobody said it was going to be easy for us, but we will never be stopped.
[03:12.840 --> 03:19.840]  I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
[03:19.840 --> 03:23.840]  Record low unemployment and a record high stock market.
[03:23.840 --> 03:29.840]  The Trump economy is red hot.
[03:29.840 --> 03:34.840]  Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.
[03:34.840 --> 03:39.840]  They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
[03:39.840 --> 03:46.840]  John Goon says President Trump will pay dearly for those words.
[03:46.840 --> 03:48.840]  Getting a good picture, everybody.
[03:48.840 --> 03:50.840]  So we have a nice and answer.
[03:50.840 --> 03:52.840]  Beautiful.
[03:55.840 --> 04:00.840]  North Korea now committing to complete denuclearization.
[04:00.840 --> 04:03.840]  I mean, it's truly remarkable what he's doing.
[04:03.840 --> 04:06.840]  He has done more than any president in recent history.
[04:06.840 --> 04:12.840]  Certainly in the last half century.
[04:12.840 --> 04:14.840]  He's not a politician.
[04:14.840 --> 04:19.840]  He's one of us.
[04:19.840 --> 04:24.840]  Never, ever, ever give up.
[04:24.840 --> 04:30.840]  Never stop fighting for what you believe in and for the people who care about you.
[04:30.840 --> 04:36.840]  Show yourself with dignity and pride.
[04:36.840 --> 04:39.840]  Relish the opportunity to be an outsider.
[04:39.840 --> 04:45.840]  Embrace that label because it's the outsiders who change the world.
[04:45.840 --> 04:49.840]  And it'll make a real and lasting difference.
[04:49.840 --> 04:51.840]  And that's why they want us shut down.
[04:51.840 --> 04:53.840]  We are the outsiders. We are banned and we are.
[04:53.840 --> 04:57.840]  Number one on iTunes and on Android after being banned.
[04:57.840 --> 04:59.840]  Number one.
[04:59.840 --> 05:01.840]  We knew it was coming.
[05:01.840 --> 05:03.840]  The whole thing was for me leg.
[05:03.840 --> 05:06.840]  First demonize Info Wars, lie about us, build a straw man,
[05:06.840 --> 05:08.840]  then sue us to add credibility to that,
[05:08.840 --> 05:11.840]  then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook
[05:11.840 --> 05:15.840]  with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[05:15.840 --> 05:17.840]  And then wallah.
[05:17.840 --> 05:22.840]  Two weeks later ban Info Wars completely off of dozens of major platforms
[05:22.840 --> 05:26.840]  where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[05:26.840 --> 05:29.840]  Go to infowars.com for a slash show.
[05:29.840 --> 05:31.840]  Subscribe to the free podcast.
[05:31.840 --> 05:34.840]  Just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in,
[05:34.840 --> 05:36.840]  it'll pop up there.
[05:36.840 --> 05:39.840]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com for a slash newsletter
[05:39.840 --> 05:42.840]  and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you
[05:42.840 --> 05:45.840]  and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[05:45.840 --> 05:49.840]  But whatever you do, tell folks about infowars.com for a slash show,
[05:49.840 --> 05:52.840]  how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps,
[05:52.840 --> 05:55.840]  how they can then reach out to others with the information
[05:55.840 --> 05:57.840]  and point out this is the verboten info.
[05:57.840 --> 05:59.840]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[06:02.840 --> 06:04.840]  Waging War on Corruption.
[06:04.840 --> 06:10.840]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[06:15.840 --> 06:17.840]  So we've got the Twitter employees.
[06:17.840 --> 06:20.840]  We've got Joe Scarborough at the dead intern found his office,
[06:20.840 --> 06:22.840]  calling for him to be banned.
[06:22.840 --> 06:26.840]  You've got BuzzFeed, The New York Times running.
[06:26.840 --> 06:29.840]  Huge polls where 78% of their own readers say,
[06:29.840 --> 06:31.840]  no, we don't want Alex banned.
[06:31.840 --> 06:34.840]  Because The New York Times, in fact, print me that article, please.
[06:34.840 --> 06:37.840]  Ask the question, well, should he be completely banned everywhere?
[06:37.840 --> 06:40.840]  Hell, should he be thrown in a gulag, basically?
[06:40.840 --> 06:42.840]  And people said, no, you're crazy.
[06:42.840 --> 06:44.840]  And then you read all the Twitter comments.
[06:44.840 --> 06:47.840]  Even people that don't like me or don't like the straw man
[06:47.840 --> 06:51.840]  that mainstream media has built about me said this is authoritarianism
[06:51.840 --> 06:53.840]  big time.
[06:53.840 --> 06:56.840]  Here it is, Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest, and Apple
[06:56.840 --> 07:00.840]  have removed Alex Jones and Info Wars from their platforms.
[07:00.840 --> 07:03.840]  Should Twitter follow suit?
[07:03.840 --> 07:07.840]  Over 11,000 users, this was days ago, it's more than that now,
[07:07.840 --> 07:11.840]  have responded at the time of the writing with 78% rejecting the proposal,
[07:11.840 --> 07:14.840]  only 14% supporting it.
[07:14.840 --> 07:17.840]  Users have slammed The Times for encouraging more censorship
[07:17.840 --> 07:21.840]  from authoritarian tech giants, also citing the paper's highly controversial
[07:21.840 --> 07:26.840]  hire of outspoken anti-white journalist, Sarah Young, to its editorial board
[07:26.840 --> 07:29.840]  in blatant hypocrisy.
[07:29.840 --> 07:32.840]  But at least you can show her tweets where she says whites are subhumans
[07:32.840 --> 07:34.840]  who need to be exterminated.
[07:34.840 --> 07:37.840]  They don't ever show anything I say.
[07:37.840 --> 07:41.840]  They just go, Jones says the moon landings didn't happen,
[07:41.840 --> 07:42.840]  never said it.
[07:42.840 --> 07:46.840]  Jones says there's Martian bases with slaves on it, never said it.
[07:46.840 --> 07:49.840]  Jones says nobody died at Sandy Hook and bullies the families.
[07:49.840 --> 07:51.840]  That's out of context from years ago.
[07:51.840 --> 07:54.840]  They never show me saying I think they died.
[07:54.840 --> 07:55.840]  They reopen it.
[07:55.840 --> 07:57.840]  They reopen the loons.
[07:57.840 --> 08:01.840]  But they're the New York Times that quarterbacked the lies about WMD,
[08:01.840 --> 08:06.840]  Yellow Cake, aluminum tubes, consciously with the office of special plans
[08:06.840 --> 08:11.840]  to launch that evil war that killed millions and many of our troops as well.
[08:11.840 --> 08:16.840]  So the vast majority voted against it.
[08:16.840 --> 08:19.840]  People say I would never have thought about listening to her supporting
[08:19.840 --> 08:20.840]  Alex Jones until today.
[08:20.840 --> 08:24.840]  This won't end well for the leftist who support this deplatforming
[08:24.840 --> 08:27.840]  warned another user.
[08:27.840 --> 08:30.840]  And it goes on, democracy dies in darkness, replied one user,
[08:30.840 --> 08:35.840]  mocking the slogan of the Times Confederates to Washington Post,
[08:35.840 --> 08:39.840]  oh, it's sick.
[08:39.840 --> 08:43.840]  When I sit there and I watch Brian Stelter and all the usual suspects
[08:43.840 --> 08:47.840]  and clips online, people only watch it to ridicule it
[08:47.840 --> 08:49.840]  and actually watch the main program usually.
[08:49.840 --> 08:52.840]  They're like, Donald Trump wants to shut down.
[08:52.840 --> 08:55.840]  Donald Trump wants to shut down the internet and free press.
[08:55.840 --> 08:56.840]  He's dangerous.
[08:56.840 --> 08:57.840]  He wants blood everywhere.
[08:57.840 --> 09:00.840]  He wants us killed because he criticizes us.
[09:00.840 --> 09:03.840]  It's horrible that he wants to shut down media and says he doesn't
[09:03.840 --> 09:04.840]  like the First Amendment.
[09:04.840 --> 09:06.840]  Donald Trump said none of that.
[09:06.840 --> 09:09.840]  He counterpunches to you liars.
[09:09.840 --> 09:14.840]  And then you'll have the same program, the same hour,
[09:14.840 --> 09:19.840]  where they're like, Twitter needs to ban Alex Jones right now.
[09:19.840 --> 09:21.840]  Why is he still on?
[09:21.840 --> 09:23.840]  He should be banned from everywhere.
[09:23.840 --> 09:26.840]  He's clearly a very dangerous person.
[09:26.840 --> 09:31.840]  We can't allow evil, racist, horrible, Nazi ideas like this to continue.
[09:31.840 --> 09:33.840]  It's too dangerous.
[09:33.840 --> 09:36.840]  So out of one side of their mouth, they're like, shut Alex Jones down.
[09:36.840 --> 09:37.840]  Shut all the conservatives down.
[09:37.840 --> 09:41.840]  Senator Murphy says Jones is just the tip of the rotting iceberg.
[09:41.840 --> 09:43.840]  Ban all the conservatives.
[09:43.840 --> 09:45.840]  Our democracy depends on it.
[09:45.840 --> 09:50.840]  You mean America has politically realigned against you.
[09:50.840 --> 09:54.840]  You've been denying the censorship, so now you're just admitting it.
[09:54.840 --> 09:55.840]  It's like in Braveheart.
[09:55.840 --> 09:58.840]  They ask, what are you doing to William Wallace?
[09:58.840 --> 10:02.840]  He says, I'm going to pick a fight.
[10:02.840 --> 10:04.840]  And that's what we've done, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:04.840 --> 10:08.840]  We didn't say any of the things that they said we said.
[10:08.840 --> 10:15.840]  What we did do was let the New York Times, the Washington Post,
[10:15.840 --> 10:18.840]  and others know that there's been more hidden camera footage of their people
[10:18.840 --> 10:19.840]  coming out soon.
[10:19.840 --> 10:22.840]  And it's damning.
[10:22.840 --> 10:28.840]  And more importantly, we talked about the chai comms and told everybody
[10:28.840 --> 10:32.840]  the personnel officer personnel management hack was an Obama handover of
[10:32.840 --> 10:36.840]  infrastructure, a globalist merger that China is on a war footing against us,
[10:36.840 --> 10:40.840]  that Apple and Google have officially moved to China and are building
[10:40.840 --> 10:43.840]  censorship systems here in their own whistleblowers admissions.
[10:43.840 --> 10:48.840]  They don't want me amplifying with the intercept document show.
[10:48.840 --> 10:55.840]  And I told crew here, last week I said, you watch.
[10:55.840 --> 10:59.840]  I believe we'll be banned by next week for this China reporting because we
[10:59.840 --> 11:03.840]  also said on Friday that Feinstein had a Chinese spy.
[11:03.840 --> 11:05.840]  She didn't have a Chinese spy.
[11:05.840 --> 11:06.840]  She put him there on purpose.
[11:06.840 --> 11:08.840]  That was part of her marriage to China.
[11:08.840 --> 11:14.840]  Her husband's biotech company based in China.
[11:14.840 --> 11:15.840]  She's a Chinese spy.
[11:15.840 --> 11:19.840]  And man, I said that last Friday, last Thursday.
[11:19.840 --> 11:23.840]  And then when that came out over the weekend, they went, whoa, who does
[11:23.840 --> 11:25.840]  Jones know?
[11:25.840 --> 11:27.840]  Man, I don't need to get this from the Pentagon.
[11:27.840 --> 11:31.840]  I get it from my own open source research about who surrounds her and some
[11:31.840 --> 11:35.840]  quick checking, you know, the Democrats are Chinese communist agents.
[11:35.840 --> 11:38.840]  It was the Rockefeller plan.
[11:38.840 --> 11:41.840]  That's who they are.
[11:41.840 --> 11:50.840]  You think China didn't have running water in 1949 almost anywhere but a few hotels?
[11:50.840 --> 11:58.840]  I mean, China until the 80s, most bathrooms were latrines at restaurants.
[11:58.840 --> 12:00.840]  You go to many areas of China still.
[12:00.840 --> 12:03.840]  There's a hole in the ground you crap in.
[12:03.840 --> 12:06.840]  How did they go from not having a pot to piss in?
[12:06.840 --> 12:11.840]  And now they've got everything better than us.
[12:11.840 --> 12:13.840]  We were sold out.
[12:13.840 --> 12:14.840]  They have tariffs on everything.
[12:14.840 --> 12:15.840]  We have nothing on them.
[12:15.840 --> 12:16.840]  They have slave labor.
[12:16.840 --> 12:18.840]  It was a setup.
[12:18.840 --> 12:24.840]  I'm a patriotic, loyal American because I believe in Americanism and I believe in
[12:24.840 --> 12:31.840]  the free market and I believe in the vision of the Renaissance.
[12:31.840 --> 12:37.840]  And I've just been advising Congress and everybody else, they're talking about
[12:37.840 --> 12:41.840]  Russia collusion because we have them on China.
[12:41.840 --> 12:42.840]  We have them.
[12:42.840 --> 12:43.840]  We have them.
[12:43.840 --> 12:47.840]  We have them.
[12:47.840 --> 12:51.840]  We have them politically in our gun sites.
[12:51.840 --> 12:53.840]  That does not mean we're going to shoot them.
[12:53.840 --> 12:54.840]  I think the public saw it.
[12:54.840 --> 12:57.840]  They go, Joe claims Feinstein's in his gun sites politically.
[12:57.840 --> 13:02.840]  Just like Giuliani said that this whole investigation is going to blow up in
[13:02.840 --> 13:03.840]  Mueller's face.
[13:03.840 --> 13:11.840]  That doesn't mean blow him up with C4 or TNT or dynamite like Wiley Coyote.
[13:11.840 --> 13:16.840]  It means it's going to blow up in his face like every thinking person knows.
[13:16.840 --> 13:22.840]  It's all coming down, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:22.840 --> 13:24.840]  Folks better decide which side they're on.
[13:24.840 --> 13:28.840]  I have a statement at infowars.com that we've retweeted at real Alex Jones.
[13:28.840 --> 13:29.840]  I'm going to retweet it again.
[13:29.840 --> 13:33.840]  Alex Jones has written a statement on Internet censorship and then I'm going to
[13:33.840 --> 13:38.840]  get into what's really going on with Jack Dorsey and what's going to unfold.
[13:38.840 --> 13:40.840]  But this is all about the elections.
[13:40.840 --> 13:42.840]  This is all about free speech.
[13:42.840 --> 13:46.840]  This is all about setting the press infinity platform, everybody.
[13:46.840 --> 13:52.840]  And it's about bringing in the communist Chinese style global social score that
[13:52.840 --> 13:57.840]  Google developed as a social engineering control tool to track everything you do
[13:57.840 --> 14:00.840]  that China has bought.
[14:00.840 --> 14:01.840]  This is all on record.
[14:01.840 --> 14:04.840]  We first broke it five years ago.
[14:04.840 --> 14:07.840]  Now it's all on record.
[14:07.840 --> 14:11.840]  And the enemy just keeps asking, how do we know all this?
[14:11.840 --> 14:13.840]  The nose knows.
[14:13.840 --> 14:17.840]  I mean, I study all this stuff and then I'm able to integrate it together.
[14:17.840 --> 14:19.840]  And I'm able to understand how these systems work.
[14:19.840 --> 14:23.840]  And a lot of you guys brag about this stuff in white paper so I can figure it out.
[14:23.840 --> 14:28.840]  But now people figure out what Jones figures out is what's going on.
[14:28.840 --> 14:33.840]  And they want me shut up as if you guys understand I would be more devastating as
[14:33.840 --> 14:35.840]  a lobbyist on Capitol Hill.
[14:35.840 --> 14:37.840]  Just going in and talking to people and giving them reports.
[14:37.840 --> 14:39.840]  I'm starting to figure that out, too.
[14:39.840 --> 14:42.840]  Why sit there and talk to the masses?
[14:42.840 --> 14:44.840]  Reports.
[14:44.840 --> 14:45.840]  Reports.
[14:45.840 --> 14:47.840]  Because people already know my reports.
[14:47.840 --> 14:51.840]  Our reports are kryptonite to evil.
[14:51.840 --> 14:52.840]  Kryptonite to globalism.
[14:52.840 --> 14:53.840]  Kryptonite to the chycoms.
[14:53.840 --> 14:57.840]  And so we get more sophisticated by the month.
[14:57.840 --> 15:03.840]  We learn more in a month now than we learned in a year before.
[15:03.840 --> 15:08.840]  And by the way, we were already when we launched this new app and I heard him up.
[15:08.840 --> 15:10.840]  We get the app out soon.
[15:10.840 --> 15:13.840]  And the app was ready a few months ago and I got busy and plug it.
[15:13.840 --> 15:15.840]  So we officially launched it about three, four weeks ago.
[15:15.840 --> 15:17.840]  It was already in the top 40 of news apps.
[15:17.840 --> 15:19.840]  Because we're popular already.
[15:19.840 --> 15:21.840]  And then when they banned it, it went to number three.
[15:21.840 --> 15:24.840]  Now number one on iTunes and Android.
[15:24.840 --> 15:30.840]  And it's number 40 something, or maybe it's 30 now, in just total apps globally.
[15:30.840 --> 15:38.840]  So, and then, oh my God, the New York Times, the Washington Post, Piss Feed, all of them, Buzzkill.
[15:38.840 --> 15:42.840]  They don't know what to do when it's number one.
[15:42.840 --> 15:46.840]  And they just can't stand it because, again, the Streisand effect blew up.
[15:46.840 --> 15:49.840]  And this isn't China where they got to test their censorship systems.
[15:49.840 --> 15:51.840]  It's America, so there's still some fighting spirit.
[15:51.840 --> 15:52.840]  So they don't know what to do.

[20:52.840 --> 20:57.840]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[20:57.840 --> 21:05.840]  It's Alex Jones.
[21:05.840 --> 21:08.840]  There's a lot of other big world news happening.
[21:08.840 --> 21:12.840]  I intend to open the phones up today to get your take on what's unfolding.
[21:12.840 --> 21:24.840]  But obviously we are at the center right now of the big global controversy of, oh, we've demonized this guy, Alex Jones.
[21:24.840 --> 21:28.840]  He's bad because we all agree in mainstream media and academia.
[21:28.840 --> 21:41.840]  So let's de-platform him, let's shut him off, let's contact all the companies that run software for his websites and let's just bankrupt him in a giant coordinated mafia attack.
[21:41.840 --> 21:44.840]  That's what the Nazis did in Nazi Germany, that's what the mafia did in this country.
[21:44.840 --> 21:46.840]  It's totally illegal.
[21:46.840 --> 21:50.840]  But they think they're going to get away with it and set the precedent for it.
[21:50.840 --> 21:56.840]  Not if the American people contact Congress, not if folks take action.
[21:56.840 --> 22:10.840]  So I am asking to be able to testify to Congress and to go under, you know, the hot lights, but I want it to be live and on television and to really lay out what's really going on here.
[22:10.840 --> 22:19.840]  And I've been talking to several members of Congress and I have other sources talking to them as well about sponsoring us in a committee to have those hearings.
[22:19.840 --> 22:21.840]  And then to come in and lay out what's really going on.
[22:21.840 --> 22:30.840]  Because I can walk in there with exhibits of the quotes of U.S. senators, you name it, saying they want to shut down their competition politically.
[22:30.840 --> 22:45.840]  So let me now read to you my statement that's on Infowars.com that we just retweeted at Real Alex Jones on Twitter and at Prison Planet on Paul Watson's Twitter.
[22:45.840 --> 22:55.840]  Because what you're about to hear exactly three months out from the critical midterm election, the most important midterm election in U.S. history undoubtedly,
[22:55.840 --> 23:08.840]  what you are about to hear is the key to having the will of the people at a free open election take place to continue making this country great again and taking it out from under the control of the big multinational banks,
[23:08.840 --> 23:23.840]  the corrupt influence of the EU, but mainly the Communist Chinese that own our debt, own Hollywood, have thousands of front companies in the U.S. control major universities and are now working with big tech giants to complete censorship here in America.
[23:23.840 --> 23:32.840]  This is a 21st century economic and cyber invasion and I as a modern Paul Revere am raising the alarm.
[23:32.840 --> 23:35.840]  They tried to buy me off a long time ago.
[23:35.840 --> 23:45.840]  Almost anybody wants to be famous in part of Hollywood and I was, you want to put me in movies and starring roles at my own TV show, $10 million a year.
[23:45.840 --> 23:53.840]  That was a lot of money in 2005, 2006, but I turned it down, folks. It was easy to do.
[23:53.840 --> 23:55.840]  Now you see why.
[23:55.840 --> 24:01.840]  So they just collect people like baseball cards.
[24:01.840 --> 24:04.840]  Now let's continue here.
[24:04.840 --> 24:08.840]  Alex Jones written statement on internet censorship.
[24:08.840 --> 24:10.840]  This is critical to get out.
[24:10.840 --> 24:20.840]  This is a dangerous precedent that can be used against any ideology left or right across the board and what appears to be a highly coordinated effort.
[24:20.840 --> 24:23.840]  And I tried to be nice there.
[24:23.840 --> 24:30.840]  It's admittedly coordinated across the board and what appears to be a highly coordinated effort to silence the message behind info wars and Alex Jones.
[24:30.840 --> 24:42.840]  Most major social media backbone utilities associated with our website and video platforms have launched unprecedented account bans and suspensions on virtually all of our channels.
[24:42.840 --> 24:53.840]  Regardless of what you think of me and what you have heard indirectly through third party sources, you are clearly witnessing a 21st century purge of an ideology.
[24:53.840 --> 25:10.840]  And even if you don't agree with our message or the straw man message you've been told that everyone should exercise their right to question the status quo, you should be very concerned about what's happening.
[25:10.840 --> 25:18.840]  Because this ideology that is now under attack is the same ideology that played a pivotal role in the founding of this great nation.
[25:18.840 --> 25:25.840]  Challenging the establishment system with independent ideas that encourage new debates and discussions.
[25:25.840 --> 25:35.840]  For more than a year we have witnessed the mainstream media and the democratic groups tell us that the manipulation of social media could turn an election and is criminal.
[25:35.840 --> 25:53.840]  But their own admission and by their own admission social media would be the most viable option to alter the course of a nation influence millions of people and shut down free speech and personal expression that question the status quo, i.e. the global social credit score.
[25:53.840 --> 26:06.840]  We have been told that one of the greatest threats to our republic's democracy, we are a constitutional republic, is the manipulation of the information that we receive on social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.
[26:06.840 --> 26:21.840]  Now that these groups that have been telling us that free speech must be defended against those who seek to control it on our news feeds have launched a full scale war on free speech information that they disagree with.
[26:21.840 --> 26:37.840]  There is no question that large social media companies have become the nation's premier sources of information, 90% of it, referring hundreds of millions to news and information daily.
[26:37.840 --> 26:51.840]  Although these groups are private entities their scale has achieved that a monopoly on the free flow of information, much like the FCC rules that the airwaves and cables should be equally accessible to all in the public trust.
[26:51.840 --> 27:04.840]  These modes of communication could and should be equally open to the same access and not subject to control by those who may choose to disagree with the information itself.
[27:04.840 --> 27:11.840]  Is a different opinion enough to silence an entire ideology or ban someone to the phantom zone?
[27:11.840 --> 27:27.840]  I do not claim to always be right, but the accusations leveled at me are distortions of the truth and have been used to systematically impeach my character with never allowing me to respond and now attempting to completely de-platform me so I can respond to nothing
[27:27.840 --> 27:36.840]  so a real straw man can be built and then destroyed as the archetype to destroy all of your speech.
[27:36.840 --> 27:53.840]  But the coordinated action of the establishment to silence me has only awakened a new resolve in those who now see more clearly than ever how the establishment systems will go to any level to shut down free speech and information that questions the status quo.
[27:53.840 --> 28:08.840]  This is a turning point for our nation, make no mistake. Will you rally behind the principles of free speech or will you concede to having your ability to access new ideas and information restricted and controlled by those who believe you cannot think for yourself?
[28:08.840 --> 28:15.840]  If we allow this level of corruption and censorship to continue, it won't be long before it becomes normalized, which is now happening.
[28:15.840 --> 28:24.840]  How long before it's not Alex Jones' info wars being shut down on major platforms, but any ideology that disagrees with the establishment status quo?
[28:24.840 --> 28:34.840]  There'll be clicks even within companies and subgroups. It's all about power and you feed into the pettiness of the worst people, just giving them the power through something like this. It's a total nightmare.
[28:34.840 --> 28:47.840]  We must rally behind the principles that founded this great nation and not allow deep censorship to become normalized and accepted or next we will face the other degrees of tyranny that invariably follow like night follows day and day follows night.
[28:47.840 --> 28:58.840]  We'll be back with how to fight back and who else is being censored and the Democrats call to silence everyone ahead of the midterms except their people. This is true evil.

[33:20.840 --> 33:31.840]  InfoWars.com is tomorrow's news. Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[33:31.840 --> 34:00.840]  That's right, they were censoring in secret, but they went a little too far, and now they've had a policy of truth and said, we want Alex Jones and every other nationalist, and every other white male, and every other conservative, and Christian.
[34:01.840 --> 34:12.840]  And every other capitalist banned off the internet and everything else. Policy of truth. Never again, huh?
[34:12.840 --> 34:30.840]  Fools! And now, after our app goes to number one in the world on both the Android and Google app in news, and is set to go to number one total, they are in panic mode.
[34:30.840 --> 34:39.840]  CNN, MSNBC, BuzzFeed, the New York Times, they are screaching.
[34:39.840 --> 34:49.840]  And telling Apple, you must delete his app. I've had seven or eight apps on there before they get old. We launched new ones. We have apps on there.
[34:49.840 --> 34:59.840]  We have an old app. We launched, like, eight, nine years ago that's just audio and text articles that's got, like, nine million people that signed up for it.
[34:59.840 --> 35:04.840]  So, of course, millions have already signed up for this. Of course, it's going to go to number one.
[35:04.840 --> 35:14.840]  Oh, see, but you say you're the real news over at CNN when you're not rigging the debates or lying about WMDs just like the New York Times.
[35:14.840 --> 35:19.840]  And you've got the weekly standard of failed publication no one reads. They all want us banned.
[35:19.840 --> 35:26.840]  Notice how CNN spins it when they're not getting Gulf State dictator money or Chai Con money. It's Apple and Google.
[35:26.840 --> 35:41.840]  Put it back up, please. Apple and Google are still selling the M4's app, which contains some of the same type of content that both tech giants have pulled from elsewhere on their platforms.
[35:41.840 --> 35:44.840]  What have you been hearing here on the air?
[35:44.840 --> 35:49.840]  They want to arrest the former mayor of London who's a liberal because he said there's people with burkas everywhere.
[35:49.840 --> 36:00.840]  That's not good in a Western society. Where are the feminists? They're looking at arresting him. I have the articles.
[36:00.840 --> 36:05.840]  First, they were saying it was the criminal offense. Now they're saying it isn't. This is their intimidation.
[36:05.840 --> 36:10.840]  I was in a cheesecake factory and women came in in the beekeeper suits. Scared the hell out of me. I had three daughters.
[36:10.840 --> 36:18.840]  They were there with me. They're like, Dad, what's that? A woman was getting food and eating under her deal. She's a slave under Sharia.
[36:18.840 --> 36:27.840]  She can't drive a car. She goes to prison if she gets caught with it off her head.
[36:27.840 --> 36:31.840]  Oh, the new Burka Barbie.
[36:31.840 --> 36:37.840]  And you go to the mall now and it's just like, you know, on the gap and everywhere. Paul Watson's reports coming up next segment.
[36:37.840 --> 36:43.840]  There are big signs of how cool it is. I mean, this is crazy.
[36:43.840 --> 36:52.840]  Don't open the door for me. Patriarchy America sucks.
[36:52.840 --> 36:58.840]  But don't criticize somebody wearing a Burka will kick you off.
[36:58.840 --> 37:05.840]  And they do in Germany. They arrest you. They hired former Stasi operatives to run.
[37:05.840 --> 37:10.840]  Four years ago, the Facebook reporting of people to the police.
[37:10.840 --> 37:16.840]  They put in jail. That's where we are. The takedown of our country being conditioned and trained.
[37:16.840 --> 37:22.840]  Get everybody on the social networks, make it 90% of the web and then condition you and shut you down.
[37:22.840 --> 37:30.840]  If you don't submit to the insanity and have weirdos from San Francisco, tell you you're not liberal.
[37:30.840 --> 37:36.840]  Because you're not into all this sickening weirdness.
[37:36.840 --> 37:44.840]  This is authoritarianism. So imagine where the number one app in news on Android and on Apple.
[37:44.840 --> 37:52.840]  And what is their response? We're number 30 something now in the world.
[37:52.840 --> 37:57.840]  Now, again, what you keep showing from yesterday is just a screenshot of trending.
[37:57.840 --> 38:02.840]  Go to the actual news. We're number one on Apple. Pull it up.
[38:02.840 --> 38:06.840]  I have to crew when they're getting together the new screenshots, please. I don't want to keep using the old ones.
[38:06.840 --> 38:13.840]  So we've got all that going on.
[38:13.840 --> 38:17.840]  And we've got them trying to shut everybody down.
[38:17.840 --> 38:22.840]  Now think about how crazy that is. And Democrat senators saying we're going to shut everybody down.
[38:22.840 --> 38:26.840]  Where's Congress? Where are the hearings? Where is everybody up in arms?
[38:26.840 --> 38:32.840]  I'm your friend. Don't run. We are your friends. Everything's fine, President Trump.
[38:32.840 --> 38:38.840]  Don't have a criminal investigation for federal elections commission violations that we're blocking all the conservatives ahead of the campaign.
[38:38.840 --> 38:45.840]  Right into the midterms. We have them.
[38:45.840 --> 38:49.840]  And Dorsey's people are like, Dorsey, you've sold out. We want him banned right now.
[38:49.840 --> 38:53.840]  And he's like, I was the vanguard of censorship, idiots. We went too far. Shut up.
[38:53.840 --> 38:59.840]  They're on us. God Almighty will get Jones later.
[38:59.840 --> 39:05.840]  And then the frothing reports. The frothing reports everywhere.
[39:05.840 --> 39:10.840]  About how I need to be taken off the air. How I need to be shut down. How I'm the devil incarnate.
[39:10.840 --> 39:15.840]  How I'm the worst thing since the devil was born.
[39:15.840 --> 39:24.840]  By so-called liberal journalists, these people are authoritarians because China runs Google. It runs Apple now.
[39:24.840 --> 39:33.840]  The others want entree into it. So they're hiring people and training people who are SJWs trained in malice philosophy at the universities as the operating system.
[39:33.840 --> 39:42.840]  That isn't by accident. All 50 state run colleges that came out even in the Washington Post are run by the chai comms.
[39:42.840 --> 39:51.840]  This is a takeover. The Antifa are malice youth brigades. All of it is a plan.
[39:51.840 --> 39:54.840]  So if you go to infowars.com, we have the Steve Watson article breaking it down.
[39:54.840 --> 40:02.840]  Apple says it's monitoring the info wars app, threatens to censor it if it becomes harmful.
[40:02.840 --> 40:07.840]  Imagine aliens show up and see the earth. And they say,
[40:07.840 --> 40:12.840]  from a million megameters we judge that your planet is evil and threatening.
[40:12.840 --> 40:16.840]  Stand by for planetary destruction. Thank you.
[40:16.840 --> 40:25.840]  We find you harmful. It's a subjective term we find. We don't like you. We say you're hateful. We say you're bad.
[40:25.840 --> 40:28.840]  We don't show how that is. We don't convict you. We don't prove it to court.
[40:28.840 --> 40:33.840]  Sure, we sue you as the proof just like Mueller indicts. That's the proof you're Russian.
[40:33.840 --> 40:38.840]  We control reality now. We are your political masters. We will teach you how to deceive.
[40:38.840 --> 40:44.840]  We will teach you the tricks. If you good earthlings join us, some of you may be able to leave with us.
[40:44.840 --> 40:51.840]  I'm doing an allegory now. I don't mean aliens are really about to destroy the planet, but imagine.
[40:51.840 --> 40:56.840]  After BuzzFeed and others reach out to them, they say, why is it he banned off this?
[40:56.840 --> 40:58.840]  Why do you even allow him to have an app?
[40:58.840 --> 41:03.840]  They go, well, we were streaming his services and placing it in our index. We've de-indexed him.
[41:03.840 --> 41:08.840]  But the app, just like a website, allows you to go to him. And, you know, that's kind of real racketeering.
[41:08.840 --> 41:14.840]  If we do that, they're like, but don't worry. We're monitoring it just like you monitored China where Apple is now run by.
[41:14.840 --> 41:20.840]  And they said five months ago in Reuters that the Chinese government now runs Apple and is helping round up political dissidents.
[41:20.840 --> 41:24.840]  It has the keys of the iCloud. So I'm going to give you the headline here.
[41:24.840 --> 41:28.840]  Communist China now in control of Apple calls for Alex Jones to be banned.
[41:28.840 --> 41:35.840]  And they're just having a discourse and debate to see if Americans wake up and are like, okay, we may ban him.
[41:35.840 --> 41:41.840]  We're listening to him. We're watching him. We're listening to Alex Jones right now.
[41:41.840 --> 41:49.840]  Of course you are. You know, you sold out. You've got suicide factories, suicide nets, forced abortion, forced drugging, 18-hour workdays at Foxconn.
[41:49.840 --> 41:54.840]  You're monsters. You help round up, fall on gong and questions and sell their organs.
[41:54.840 --> 42:02.840]  So of course you're introducing us to a social score. You're introducing us to the bad man who you first demonized for years to now sell America on this crap.
[42:02.840 --> 42:09.840]  But America is going to figure it out. And you're going to get your asses busted up in trust-busting and national security.
[42:09.840 --> 42:18.840]  And when it's all over, it'll be like World War II. People will ask how the hell they get so many Americans to join the Nazi side.
[42:18.840 --> 42:25.840]  Same deal. So good luck, busters. And then CNN sitting there foaming at the mouth. Get him off the air. Get him off the air.
[42:25.840 --> 42:36.840]  Imagine Apple openly censoring, openly spying on the iCloud. And they told Reuters they go, well, when you're based in China, the government's embedded with you.
[42:36.840 --> 42:41.840]  And that's just how it is. And now the Chinese government runs Apple. We're tax exempt. So they get more money.
[42:41.840 --> 42:49.840]  Now Tim Cook's a trillion-dollar company. Yay! Based on slavery. But he's funding Black Lives Matter teaching them about 160 years ago.
[42:49.840 --> 43:15.840]  So that you only think about the past, not what he's currently doing now. But don't worry. Tim Cook and the Chinese are set to ban us. Don't worry.

[47:02.840 --> 47:18.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:18.840 --> 47:35.840]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure, you're listening to Alex Jones. So it's a major national security issue that Apple officially announced five months ago.
[47:35.840 --> 47:51.840]  They're Chinese Communist run and are helping censor and control the Chinese people and the main iCloud keys to the entire planet are now state run by the Chai comms. The Communist Chinese own our national debt. They control all six of the major movie houses in Hollywood.
[47:51.840 --> 48:07.840]  It's been all over the news that they run Hollywood now. They control most of the major universities with their infiltration. They control Silicon Valley. There's even been political articles about that. And now Tim Cook, who has the most debilitated, horrible factories in the world that he subcontracts with,
[48:07.840 --> 48:23.840]  Foxconn, Suicide Nets, all of it, he is literally moving to banish not just off of the iTunes streams where we were in the top 10, but now our app that we just launched three weeks ago has gone to number one in both areas, but off and on they don't even list it.
[48:23.840 --> 48:47.840]  And there are five in full wars apps. Bunch of them aren't ours that are in the top 100 and they're moving to D list all of those and announcing that they're monitoring us and watching. So there you go and China threatened yesterday to take over Apple and Apple factories and shut down Apple factories in China.
[48:47.840 --> 48:58.840]  If Trump continued to stand up against their trade war against us. Did you hear that? Did you hear that?
[48:58.840 --> 49:18.840]  Think about that. I'm going to say it again. Communist China openly announced yesterday that they would take over Apple and shut down production if Trump didn't submit an internal embargo by a so called US company that's now Chinese state run.
[49:18.840 --> 49:28.840]  And now you understand what's really going on and they're using me who they first demonized to the public and psychological warfare as this test case to go well that Alex Jones you know the straw man I heard about him.
[49:28.840 --> 49:41.840]  Nobody says that they go oh that's a bad guy. You know he said Trump would win he believes in the Second Amendment and he doesn't believe every official government story and he's restoring the republic and he's standing firm under the attacks. Yeah.
[49:41.840 --> 49:56.840]  I want to virtue signal at the bar or work. Yeah he's a bad guy. And they go oh thank you. And then Senator Murphy comes out and says we're going to ban all conservatives offline. It's for the future of our democracy that your speech be banned.
[49:56.840 --> 50:02.840]  That's the weird sick ways they talk. The weird sick things they do.
[50:02.840 --> 50:13.840]  When we come back and start the next hour Paul Watson's put out a powerful report that's on infowars.com where they're threatening to arrest former mayor of London because he said there's burkas everywhere.
[50:13.840 --> 50:30.840]  These women have been enslaved and that Saudi Arabia is trying to get rid of burkas we went from like trying to pressure Saudi Arabia to stop it not letting women drive or go to college and killing him if they poorly looked at another man to like no it's good teach the children how great it is.
[50:30.840 --> 50:39.840]  Like they're talking about banning the former liberal mayor off Twitter right now in fact the virtue signalers there at Twitter are talking about it.
[50:39.840 --> 50:56.840]  So that's the point that we've gotten to as a society and a culture but listen people say well why do you even launch a app on itens and on droid.
[50:56.840 --> 51:05.840]  They're going to censor you because that's where the commerce is that's where the ideas are that's the open marketplace of ideas and.
[51:05.840 --> 51:15.840]  It's like asking a Jew in Nazi Germany in 1933 why'd you try to go run an office space and be a lawyer or be a mathematician or be a seamstress.
[51:15.840 --> 51:26.840]  You're like well that's what I do I'm going to get a little shop and I'm going to so close I'm like you're evil you get to have a job we've been banned off LinkedIn everything.
[51:26.840 --> 51:42.840]  They're depersoning us depersoning us right on 1984 and it's being done as the big beta test and it is a mega mega mega outrage but they hope it gets lost with all the other outrage and that Congress doesn't figure it out and the president doesn't figure it out.
[51:42.840 --> 51:46.840]  We are under attack by China and the collaborators.
[51:46.840 --> 51:48.840]  China runs Apple.
[51:48.840 --> 51:50.840]  Apple has already banned me off platforms.
[51:50.840 --> 51:56.840]  The Chinese government is silencing American members of the press.
[51:56.840 --> 52:02.840]  The Chinese government is silencing members of the US press on record.
[52:02.840 --> 52:11.840]  They wouldn't even let Michael Savage publish his he published it they wouldn't let him put it in stores two years ago about the Chinese takeover of America.
[52:11.840 --> 52:16.840]  People ask me how you taking it being demonized how you taking it being lied about how you taking it being.
[52:16.840 --> 52:26.840]  I'm like I'm in a war for the country with the chai comms that have killed over 100 million of their own people 80 plus million under Mao that openly own Hollywood and our debt and are trying to silence me.
[52:26.840 --> 52:37.840]  Soldiers go off and fight and die usually it's not even for our country but they mean well I'm here fighting for the real nation against the globalist for classical free speech.
[52:37.840 --> 52:50.840]  Of course enemy propaganda is demonize me of course enemy propaganda has twisted who I am and what I've said to then make me a champion of Liberty who helped get Trump into office who helped reboot the Republic who helped relaunch 1776.
[52:50.840 --> 53:06.840]  A modern Paul Revere is what info wars is not me alone all of us together are modern Paul Revere's and they don't like that and they want it shut down and they want it shut down now and look at these cowardly unpopular stupid twits.
[53:06.840 --> 53:14.840]  At the New York Times saying he's been banned should he be banned more and people are like hell no we shouldn't be banned at all.
[53:14.840 --> 53:21.840]  78% say you're totally wrong another 10% say you're pretty much wrong.
[53:21.840 --> 53:28.840]  They can only get a few percentage points to support me being banned that's got to freak them out.
[53:28.840 --> 53:40.840]  Just because of their own little bubble chambers they got into it doesn't mean everybody else is into it so yes do I have to put myself in the center of the arena.
[53:40.840 --> 53:48.840]  And take the most flak and the most fire to do this but that was the plan and it's not called trolling it's called being a man.
[53:48.840 --> 54:00.840]  I feel good my morale is good I am strong the more I'm persecuted the stronger I get because I understand it means I'm going into the furnace I'm going into the point blank range operation I'm charging the hell.
[54:00.840 --> 54:10.840]  I've already taken out 50 machine gun nests and I'm almost at the top we're almost there and you know what no matter what happens to me there's millions of people screaming behind me and we're going over the top.
[54:10.840 --> 54:20.840]  Nothing stopping us and I know that metaphysically and spiritually and I'm aligned with God and I know none of us get out of this alive so I'm not worried.
[54:20.840 --> 54:34.840]  Now they're not going to be able to stay on the app going to number one so they'll either delist it like I did when I was number one on Joe Rogan show number one podcast in history they just delisted it.
[54:34.840 --> 54:41.840]  They'll probably just be listed because it's so embarrassing and then like kick users off you'll have to resubscribe probably give them ideas but that's how they operate.
[54:41.840 --> 54:46.840]  Congressional hearings though can subpoena that we're moving in that direction being very strategic though.
[54:46.840 --> 54:56.840]  But look we're already number one in just a few days it took everybody else years to get up there number one in a couple days it backfired again.

[57:25.840 --> 57:27.840]  They think America is going down without a fight.
[57:27.840 --> 57:30.840]  They think they're going to just push us aside easily.
[57:30.840 --> 57:32.840]  No we have victory in our blood.
[57:32.840 --> 57:34.840]  We have destiny in our heart.

[57:54.840 --> 58:00.840]  Hey Alex mate I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[58:00.840 --> 58:07.840]  I remember back when Info Wars and Prison Planet it was just blue text on a white screen and they had to load down the page on my dial up internet.
[58:07.840 --> 58:12.840]  And I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests.
[58:12.840 --> 58:16.840]  And I've been using your products since the first iteration of survival shield.
[58:16.840 --> 58:24.840]  And since then I'm on the X2, the super male vitality, the caveman, the real red pill, micro ZX body, it's all amazing.
[58:24.840 --> 58:25.840]  Thank you brother.
[58:25.840 --> 58:33.840]  Yeah and I wanted to say that by following you so much it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[58:33.840 --> 58:38.840]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[58:38.840 --> 58:43.840]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew and the listeners out there.
[58:43.840 --> 58:49.840]  1776 World War.
[58:49.840 --> 58:53.840]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Info Wars dot com?
[58:53.840 --> 58:55.840]  Are you serious?
[58:55.840 --> 58:56.840]  But there's no link to them.
[58:56.840 --> 58:58.840]  Yeah like Russian collusion, Russian collusion.
[58:58.840 --> 59:08.840]  But one would have thought that this open appeal to bigotry, that doesn't even show what I'm saying, and frequent anti-semitic dog whistles.
[59:08.840 --> 59:14.840]  So notice no links in the New York Times, like we would do in our article, like if I said somebody said anti-semitic, I would link to it.
[59:14.840 --> 59:18.840]  I don't agree with being anti-semitic, you have a right to say it, but they don't show it.
[59:18.840 --> 59:32.840]  His conspiracy theories are serious, but one would have thought that his open appeals to bigotry and frequent anti-semitism dog whistles would have merited his removal from social media and podcasting platforms long ago.
[59:32.840 --> 59:41.840]  So because it's the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, I mean that'd be like if I said the guy that wrote this is a Nazi.
[59:41.840 --> 59:43.840]  Well he'd sue me, I'm not saying he is one.
[59:43.840 --> 59:47.840]  He says it about me because it's okay, because he says it in the New York Times.
[59:47.840 --> 59:54.840]  I had a New York Times writer here, and I said, yeah, when I tried to get into the inauguration, they had people blocking the entrance, just beating people up.
[59:54.840 --> 59:56.840]  She goes, that's not true, I was there.
[59:56.840 --> 01:00:00.840]  And she goes, of course she knew full wells all over the news that happened, I'm sure she agreed with it.
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.840]  And I said, after I learned that, I said, I'm not talking to you anymore.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:08.840]  I said, I'm never talking to you again, because I already knew, I never talked to him anyways, I did it as a test case.
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:16.840]  They know it's not true, they play this weird mind game of gaslighting where they want you to feel alone and weird like their will.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:22.840]  Like, you know, Islam is not oppressive, we do not wear burqas, we do not sexually mutilate women, Hillary won the election.
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:29.840]  And it's this weird, you know, mind control thing of like, no one blocked anyone with the inauguration, no one came to see Trump.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:35.840]  And I search engine and there were even Washington Post New York Times saying they blocked people, they beat them up, I was there.
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:40.840]  But they just attacked us and said it wasn't the case.
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:47.840]  Yeah, it's almost like, like trust is one of the most important things you can have, especially with a media outlet.
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.840]  And my slogan was always, I might be wrong, but I'm not lying.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.840]  No, no, but let me ask you that question.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:01:00.840]  What is this word down the left where they'll go, they'll like say something that's true and admit it, is it true?
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:03.840]  They'll look at you and smile and go, is this trying to manipulate you or is it?
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.840]  It's compliance training, it's just like how you train a dog.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:10.840]  Where you say, you know, Caitlyn Jenner is the greatest woman in the world, Caitlyn just say it.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:16.840]  It's a purity test for a cult, where if you admit to nonsense, they know they own you.
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.840]  It's how you train animals, there's no difference.
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:24.840]  So if someone says, you know, Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler, Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler, admit it.
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:28.840]  They're not asking you if you believe Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler, everyone knows he's not.
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:34.840]  They're just wanting you to submit, because they've submitted and that's the power they have.
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:39.840]  Exactly, they want to be able to know that whatever they tell you, you'll agree with.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.840]  And that's the leftist mentality.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.840]  We gotta have you back up because you're dead on target.
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:45.840]  It's always losing.
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:51.840]  Sorry, go ahead. Oh, it's an always a losing mentality, because I was talking to one of my buddies about this recently,
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:58.840]  where I was like, the one thing I love about you is when I bring up a point that you realize is a better point than what you previously believed,
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:03.840]  you looked, you look happy, you look excited, like, thank you for sharpening my sword.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:07.840]  Whereas a leftist would look threatened and then call you a bigot.
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.840]  So fundamentally, they're only dulling their own weapons.
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:14.840]  Oh, all the time I admit I'm wrong. I'm always trying to like learn new stuff.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:15.840]  Exactly.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:18.840]  And you bet a higher percentage than any of these mainstream guys.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:19.840]  I was telling that to Harrison.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.840]  I'm buddies with Harrison.
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:26.840]  I was telling them, if you go back in time, if you go six months a year and a lot of your shows,
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:33.840]  that's probably one reason why they wanted to wipe the slate is you, you're more accurate than they want to admit.
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:36.840]  And at first, sometimes you hear things and they sound jarring.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.840]  And then you see time play out and you're like, wow, it really did go to China, huh?
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:42.840]  That's wild.
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:44.840]  Let's do five more minutes and talk about that.
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:49.840]  No, 35,000 videos, two and a half billion views, 2.5 million subscribers.
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:55.840]  Like these are Star Wars analogy, like Alderaan, blown into bits, destroyed, gone.
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.840]  And they just are so pleased.
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:02.840]  And the New York Times smiles and says, Alex, nobody attacked protesters.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:04.840]  Nobody, nobody blocked Trump people.
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.840]  You're a liar.
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:07.840]  They smile.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.840]  We got your kids.

[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:42.840]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:06:04.840]  You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:27.840]  You should not come back.
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:30.840]  All right, during the break, I can't stop doing it.
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:35.840]  There's literally articles published every 30 seconds.
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.840]  Fox News has come out and said I should be banned and doesn't show what I said or did,
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:39.840]  because News Corp, most of them, want to get rid of their competition.
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:43.840]  There's this corporatist attitude of these big corporations that can't compete.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:44.840]  They want to do this.
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:49.840]  Ellen Benjamin of HugePianist.com, that's a personal plus a piano.
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:53.840]  Where do you think it ends and why do you think Jack Dorsey came out and said,
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.840]  oh, actually, we're not banning Alex Jones yet.
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.840]  He hasn't violated our rules.
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:01.840]  Then he came to his crew and he said, well, maybe we should reach outside of our platform
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.840]  and judge people who are on our platform by what they say outside.
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:06.840]  This sounds pretty creepy.
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.840]  Yeah, it's very creepy.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:14.840]  Sometimes I think a lot of this are just the sounds of dying dinosaurs that the wounded deer jumps highest,
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:19.840]  because it's almost like in middle school or high school and you had that cool group,
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:24.840]  but then they just kept excluding people like the mean girls until it's just one person.
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:29.840]  I think that the leftist media narcissism is going to end up making it so they're just alone.
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:33.840]  You know, like Stephen Colbert, I think their ratings are lower than some of my live streams.
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:38.840]  So they're just going to be talking to themselves in some creepy little dungeon.
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:39.840]  And it's really happening.
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:43.840]  I mean, they paid $18 million for this new Anderson Cooper show.
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:48.840]  And one of my live streams even censored that I do on Saturday morning, you know,
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:50.840]  have 100,000 to 100,000 views.
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.840]  His has like 50,000 views.
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:54.840]  5,000 is the peak at one time.
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:59.840]  18 million being forced fed with notices.
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.840]  Hey, Anderson Cooper, the Vanderbilt's on.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.840]  No one wants to watch it.
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:05.840]  No one wants to watch it.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:13.840]  It's, I love the term astroturfing, the fake grassroots, where they have all this money.
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.840]  They have so much money to promote all this nonsense.
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:21.840]  And so they'll get the sheep to come in, but no one will stay.
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:24.840]  You know, it's not, it's just, it's one of those McMansions.
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:29.840]  You know, one of these big houses built on just a horrible frame and it just falls over.
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:30.840]  It's kind of funny.
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:36.840]  You know, I've been through this so much and I had so much fear with it when it first happened.
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.840]  You know, even Patreon said they were going to shut down my Patreon.
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:45.840]  And these are people, these are American citizens who just choose to give me a donation to keep free speech coming to God.
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:46.840]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:50.840]  Why do people think it's cool to censor and cool to join the corporates?
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:54.840]  When the corporates, when you like, join them in a bubble, they don't pat you on the head.
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:57.840]  But it's just like feeling like you're part of the big power.
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:58.840]  Just fear.
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:08:59.840]  It's these people.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:00.840]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:01.840]  It's power over truth.
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.840]  And it's just people that have been overcome by bitterness.
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:16.840]  You know, and that's why I really don't think it'll happen in America because we're, a lot of people living in America are, our ancestors were the ones who, who wouldn't deal with that and came here.
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.840]  And so we're kind of spawned.
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:21.840]  So you're saying the genetic memory is going to kick in.
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:22.840]  Yeah.
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:27.840]  And unlike Europe, we didn't lose 60 million of our alpha males in two world wars and 30 years span.
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:28.840]  So,
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:30.840]  More than Napoleonic before that.
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.840]  That's Europe's big problem is I'm not being mean to Europe.
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:34.840]  They were just as tough as us are tougher.
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:36.840]  They wiped all their alpha males up.
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:37.840]  They did.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.840]  You know, Frenchmen used to be bigger than Englishmen or Germans.
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.840]  Yeah, they were real tough guys.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:43.840]  And now they're all dead.
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:45.840]  They were all like Viking killers.
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:47.840]  They were all killed.
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:48.840]  Yeah.
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:56.840]  That's why the ones that, that, that bailed in like the 17 1800s and to come to America, like a lot of people that were related to, uh,
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:02.840]  Areas of French canners, like six foot four big French guys are like, or they're the ones that didn't get killed.
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:03.840]  Yeah.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.840]  But now they have Justin Trudeau to deal with.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.840]  Who says, don't say mother or father.
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.840]  No, that's hate speech.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:10.840]  How dare you.
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:11.840]  Oh, and Benjamin, join us again.
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:12.840]  You're amazing.

[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:26.840]  Coming to you live from America.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:35.840]  In the middle of a civil war against the global coming to you from the former United States of America from deep in the heart of Texas.
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.840]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:43.840]  They think you're a goldfish.
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.840]  I've been betting on you my whole life.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:47.840]  I believe it now.
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.840]  I don't think you're stupid.
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:53.840]  One man and a wreck's a woman.
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:59.840]  And we're kicking these trainers asses politically and we're not backing down at her.
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:01.840]  I want to get these people.
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:02.840]  We're winning.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:03.840]  I can feel the spirit rising.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:04.840]  Can't you?
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:06.840]  We have broken their back.
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:07.840]  Yes, I can feel it.
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:12.840]  Let's go.
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:14.840]  Come on.
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:15.840]  Come on.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:16.840]  Come on.
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:17.840]  Come on.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:18.840]  Come on.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:23.840]  Come on.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.840]  Vengeance is coming.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.840]  Fire is coming.
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:36.840]  The real revolution against you is coming and you will burn in hell.
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:41.840]  I had some fun there and that's not my normal self there having some fun.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:47.840]  But Doug Hagman is joining us of the Hagman Report and so much more he's going to take over the next hour.
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:50.840]  But now you can see the full assault on free speech.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:55.840]  Misrepresenting what we said and done to build the straw man to take us all out.
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.840]  Why does Jack Dorsey not ban us?
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.840]  Everybody else has.
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:02.840]  The media is all celebrating because they're all dependent on mainstream media.
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:05.840]  They're all dependent on the social networks saying, oh, Jones is over.
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:06.840]  Jones is dead.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:10.840]  I explain this to you idiots in establishment media before.
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:16.840]  They'd already shadow banned this 90 plus percent on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:20.840]  So I openly poke the bear.
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:32.840]  Not to give them to ban us just so that it would trigger a accelerated event to have a debate ahead of the election about the fact that you're letting the leftist and the globalist and the Islamist all have free reign.
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:38.840]  But Americans and patriots and Christians and free marketers are all being censored.
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:41.840]  And it's all coming to a head right now.
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:50.840]  So it's an epic time to be alive info wars.com news wars.com the power of you going and getting the free app info wars.com.
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:59.840]  For slash app on droid or on iPhone has already sent us a number one on news on both platforms.
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:06.840]  And the top 30 to 60, depending on where you're at in total apps globally, we just launched this three weeks ago.
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:12.840]  We thought the purge was coming and I even thought it'll be nice to see them get upset when you send us a number one.
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:29.840]  But more importantly, info wars.com info wars.com forward slash show has where you can subscribe directly with us, not with Android, not with a chai com run Apple with with with cook openly working for them.
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:36.840]  But the Alex Jones show, the real news that they have a ninth war with Owen Shroyer and others like Roger Stone.
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:40.840]  So that's really where the fight is info wars.com forward slash show.
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:49.840]  We have no comments. Discuss us. We've used for eight years, Bandis Webchimp, we've been using for seven eight years Bandis.
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.840]  They're hitting our DNS is there. They're hacking us right now. They're attacking us.
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:59.840]  People say, oh, my God, you should give up. No, I'm under attack because I'm over the target.
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:02.840]  And so if they're successful, I don't do false flags.
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:08.840]  I can step back and have the engineers like in a Star Trek thing with smoke coming out trying to keep it going and say, go eat lunch.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:13.840]  We'd be down right now. So then being up here 18 hours, two days ago, right?
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:19.840]  They're cross-eyed. I can step back and say, you boys go and see your wives and children. We'd be down right now.
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:23.840]  I can say, oh, my God, they took us down. But see, I don't do that. I don't fight dirty.
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:28.840]  We're going to fight to the end, but we may go down the next few days. They're hitting us. You couldn't imagine.
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:32.840]  So we're here. We're trying to hold it up. We don't make a big deal out of it.
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:41.840]  But it's not just, oh, take me off these corporations, whatever. They're taking us down everywhere because just like they just busted 12 kids trained for mass shootings,
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:47.840]  just like the left's getting ready to move. They don't want us reaching a general audience ahead of a big event.
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:56.840]  That's my intel. And I can't wait to hear our guest host, Doug Hagman, police and investigative trainer, bestselling author, researcher, great political mind,
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:03.840]  help break some of the biggest news in 2016 about the pedophile rings. Clearly, I think, I love to make it about Info Wars,
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:08.840]  but I got to tell you, they're just trying to silence us, I think, Doug, ahead of something really big and then making their move.
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:11.840]  What's your intel? Go ahead and take over.
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:18.840]  Alex, thank you very much. By the way, congratulations on your app. We've all downloaded it here at the office and it's marvelous.
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:27.840]  It's a great thing. As a matter of fact, one more thing before you run out, I just want to tell you that we have a mutual friend I spoke with yesterday.
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:37.840]  Right after Matt Rudge visited your studios, he had a conversation. He's also a friend with Matt Rudge and a conversation with Mr. Rudge.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:48.840]  Matt Rudge had said the reason that Alex Jones is so popular and would be the first to be targeted, and I quote this and I wrote this down when I was speaking with this gentleman,
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:58.840]  is that Alex Jones and Info Wars has the pulse of the nation and their finger on the pulse of the nation.
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:10.840]  That's what makes Info Wars and use so dangerous is because you're plugged into that pulse that's representative of our republic, so great job.
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:18.840]  Can you not feel the pulse like it's electric, like you feel America coming back and spirituals, like boom, boom, boom, that's what they're scared of,
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:23.840]  and they think they shut me down? No, no, no, this is worldwide, people are awakening.
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:32.840]  Yeah, absolutely. We're battling on a number of planes here. Obviously, you've got the sporadic political violence, you've got the economic aspects,
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:42.840]  you've got the political warfare, but this, the censorship or the banning, I should say, is being done ahead of and you're exactly right ahead of the midterm elections
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:49.840]  and of course, well in advance of the 2020 elections. The message that you carry, the message that Info Wars carries and we carry,
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:56.840]  is must be silence, they can't refute the facts, so they've got to silence, they've got to take down Info Wars or shut them off, ban them, whatever.
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:00.840]  That's the reason, because they can't argue facts.
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:08.840]  Well, you're taking over and hosting, but clearly they're making their move and I've been told by sources that they have Islamic training camps all over the U.S.
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:14.840]  We know about some of them, we've covered them, the left attacks us when we cover it, but this bust of 12 kids trained for school shootings,
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:22.840]  you can see them getting ready to trigger this, everything else, they want us off the air for something big, Doug, what is it?
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:33.840]  Well, I think it's a combination of things. Number one, if you're calling out, calling out the, again, the sporadic political, politically charged violence,
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:40.840]  but it's something much bigger than that and I think it's all part of this ongoing civil war, it's a component of the civil war.
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:46.840]  The New Mexico compound figures dramatically in this.
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:54.840]  I was on your show, I was on Info Wars, oh my goodness, a couple of, I think probably now a month ago, maybe a month and a half ago,
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:19:01.840]  with Dr. Paul L. Williams who were talking about the investigation that I conducted into Islamberg, which is the Muslims of the Americas,
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:04.840]  headed by Sheikh Mubarak Ali Jalani.
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:14.840]  And the deal with that is this, the CIA basically brought Jalani into the United States back in 1980, or at least it was on their dime,
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:23.840]  and he set up shop in Brooklyn, and Sheikh Mubarak Jalani began what is known as the Muslims of the Americas or the community of the impoverished,
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:30.840]  it's known as Jamal al-Fukhra, and for a while it was on the terrorist watchlist in the United States.
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:42.840]  Well, it was after 9-11, and it was after the events that they were in, 2003, 4, 5 in that time period.
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:51.840]  I had conducted surveillance of an Islamic training camp that we've talked about on this show, folks, and I've disclosed,
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:58.840]  and of course the focus of which the training compounds, at least primarily, were the Muslims of the Americas,
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:01.840]  was Jamal al-Fukhra, headed by this Pakistani Sheikh.
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:12.840]  What we saw yesterday, excuse me, what we saw breaking the news yesterday, this New Mexico compound, is connected directly to the Muslims of the Americas,
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:19.840]  it's connected to the various compounds all across the United States, this of course a very small version of the larger ones out there.
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:28.840]  And what it was taking place is there's a recruitment drive of black Muslims in prisons all across the United States, I've documented this, I've sent this to the FBI,
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:38.840]  I had sent this to the FBI back in 2007, 2007, 2008, I believe it was, based on my own personal observations.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:49.840]  In fact, InfoWars had, you can go back in the archives, InfoWars had shown the school buses on the property in Hancock, New York,
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:58.840]  where the school bus was being used for training, military style training, paramilitary style training, and you've got to tell you,
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:15.840]  this is a smaller version of that, so the bottom line, what we're seeing right now is this refinement, if you will.
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:34.840]  It increases the pH up to 9 to deliver both alkaline and antioxidant water anywhere you want it.
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:37.840]  Alkaline water is healthier, tastes better, and can even boost energy.

[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:44.840]  This is Doug Hagman, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:49.840]  Doug Hagman, HagmanReport.com, sitting in for AlexInfoWars.com.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:53.840]  Folks, I kind of stopped abruptly at that last segment.
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:57.840]  I want to get into the New Mexico compound because I think that's so important.
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:02.840]  Alex made some great points about the Muslim training compounds and about this particular story.
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:11.840]  Folks, you were told about this. The people who listened to infowars.com and, of course, my platform, HagmanReport.com,
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:18.840]  we had told you about the threat of Islamists in this country preparing to make war at a given time.
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:24.840]  I had sent a report to the FBI. As a matter of fact, during the break, if you're watching this,
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:28.840]  this is the exact copy of what I sent to the FBI.
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:40.840]  This is just the text of my report, not including the video as well as the photographic evidence that I took of these training compounds.
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:47.840]  The date on that was February 12th of 2006. We've talked about that on this show.
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:55.840]  But before I get into that, I want to use this segment here just to talk about the subject that's really on everybody's mind,
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:03.840]  on everybody's lips, and that's the censorship of or the banning more appropriately, the banning of infowars.
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:13.840]  The way I look at it is we're right now, we're a time where the dominant form of speech in this nation is carried by private companies.
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:20.840]  What we saw this week is these private companies moving in lockstep. Now, consider this.
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:28.840]  It's effectively just as bad when you have got private companies moving in lockstep with one another.
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:34.840]  It is effectively just as bad as government-controlled speech. Is it not? Because the result is effectively the same.
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:37.840]  It's essentially the same. This is exactly what we saw.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:43.840]  When I took a look at this, and we knew this was coming, Alex knew this was coming, just didn't have it when.
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:50.840]  You kind of know when the bombs are on their way. You just don't know exactly precisely when they're going to hit.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:57.840]  But when you look at this, and when you start taking away, peeling back the layers of this onion,
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:04.840]  you've got Apple, you've got Facebook, you've got Spotify, YouTube, which is an alphabet Google company, of course.
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:08.840]  They all banned infowars. Now, consider this within a 12-hour period.
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:17.840]  And I looked into this. I did my own investigation. And when I looked at this, when you consider the timing
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:23.840]  and consider how they were all banned in a matter of 12 hours, the only conclusion that you can come up with,
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:30.840]  that any reasonable person can come up with, was that this was a coordinated attack. It was coordinated.
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:40.840]  And looking at it a step further, the issue really isn't that infowars was banned by these private companies,
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:48.840]  although it is, I guess, but it was the method in which it was done by these four unbelievably powerful companies
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:56.840]  working in concert within the span of 12 hours. When you look at the net value of these companies,
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:29:02.840]  where you've got Apple, a trillion dollar value. When you've got Google, 850 billion.
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:12.840]  You've got Facebook at 500 billion or half a trillion dollars. You've got Spotify at 32 billion.
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:21.840]  That, doing the math, and assuming I did this correctly, you've got 2.4 trillion dollars in those companies alone.
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:29.840]  Consider that there are only seven countries in the world with a gross domestic product that have a similar value
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:40.840]  or the influence that that GDP would carry. Those four tech companies have exercised what appears to be effectively
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:48.840]  sovereign power. So look at it a little bit differently than perhaps we've looked at it before.
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:55.840]  And I know that the phrase as well, it's an antitrust issue come in.
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:59.840]  There are a lot of different, I've heard so much over the last couple of days,
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:06.840]  because we have a stake in this as well. We are being banned as well. And you know what, you're next.
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:14.840]  And about that, I've seen so many people say, well, I don't use Facebook or I quit using Twitter
[01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:19.840]  or I just don't bother with the social networking, so it really doesn't affect me.
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:28.840]  Or I don't listen to Info Wars. And you know all of the stories. You know all of the general stories.
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:35.840]  Consider that the Jews did not have to listen to Hitler's radio speeches. They didn't have to listen to his rants.
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:45.840]  It's a problem when you consider the Germans who were listening. And what do we have today with the claims of Nazism
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:51.840]  and what have you. We've got a very similar situation. I'm not talking about the,
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:31:00.840]  I'm certainly not talking about the Holocaust. I'm talking about the parallels to the society,
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:10.840]  today's society as well with the sovereign power that these four companies actually have amassed.
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:16.840]  And again, the excuse, well, I don't use them or this doesn't affect me. It's not going to wash.
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:21.840]  And then Nuremberg Defense, it's not going to work. But I want to take you back a little bit,
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:28.840]  just a little bit ago as I conclude this segment here. I'm going to take you back in time.
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:36.840]  I remember in 2009, right after the election, the Cass Sunstein, Obama appointed Cass Sunstein
[01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:43.840]  as the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs Officer.
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:49.840]  I want to make sure I got that right. However, brief in time, the intent was there.
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:59.840]  Okay, the plans for this kind of censorship or this kind of banning or this kind of making the evolution of fake news began with Obama.
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:10.840]  It began back in 2008 after his election. And what we're seeing today is the payback, if you will, to the 2016 elections.
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:16.840]  I'm not telling you anything yet. You don't already know. I'm just kind of prefacing everything with the information I think is important
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:24.840]  because when you look back in time, after the 2009 appointment of Cass Sunstein, and remember Cass Sunstein,
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:33.840]  who he is, in my view a communist as well, married to Samantha Power of the unmasking fame,
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:39.840]  you think that this is a coincidence? I think not. But let's fast forward from 09 to 2011.
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:45.840]  In 2011, on February 17th, there was a photograph that was floating around the Internet.
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:57.840]  I don't know if it can be brought up, but it was a February 17, 2011 meeting with many of the tech giants in San Francisco.
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:05.840]  It was a February 27, 2011 meeting in San Francisco, where at that time the CEOs of Apple, Cisco Systems,
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:15.840]  Facebook, Google, before it became alphabet, Netflix, Oracle Systems, and I could go on, all met, unprecedented, with Obama and Valerie Jarrett.
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:25.840]  And I assert it was at that meeting that they became to an agreement of sorts or laid out the groundwork for what we're seeing today.
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:35.840]  Because what we're seeing today is not a product of the Donald Trump administration, but a product of the holdovers via Obama,
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:46.840]  allowing this, or more accurately, coordinating this government sentiment of the Obama holdovers with the private companies.
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:51.840]  I'm not saying the government did this, I'm saying that elements within the government did this.
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:55.840]  There's a picture, if you're watching this live, there's a picture on the screen.
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:58.840]  So that's why history is so important, and it's so interesting.
[01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:07.840]  Our history gets revised, and that's why they don't want you, the state does not want you, to know history.
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:12.840]  Folks who are listening to Alex Jones or Infowars, Infowars.com, sitting in Doug Agnes, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:17.840]  Don't forget, folks, visit Alex Jones or visit InfowarsStore.com.
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:20.840]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:24.840]  Best hot or cold pain relief. Get the best. Get a Sunny Bay heating pad.
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:29.840]  Sometimes life can be a pain in the neck, or back, or shoulder.
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:32.840]  And the best relief for that pain is a Sunny Bay heating pad.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:38.840]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?

[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:50.840]  Why take another pill?
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:54.840]  Many people use our Sunny Bay heating pads alone and got rid of the neck pain.
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:59.840]  Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer can take its toll on your body.

[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:20.840]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:28.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:45.840]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:39:07.840]  If you haven't done so already support this movement and really it's a great American movement that the giant has awakened by the actions of the deep state by the shadow government.

[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:43.840]  None.
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:56.840]  You're either for us, meaning the people who are for free speech for open dialogue, or you're against us, meaning you are a really a fascist or someone who supports fascism.
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:06.840]  Because we are seeing this communist type activity, which is, which is really just a different word for for fascism and Nazism.
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:08.840]  They're all of the same cloth.
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:11.840]  Really, they're just different threads of the same cloth.
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:19.840]  That's contrary, of course, to the what what they want you to believe that that Nazism, for example, is on the from the extreme right.
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:26.840]  It's all on the extreme left if you study history, and that's why they don't want you to study history.
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:38.840]  But again, survival shield, alpha power, all of the products get some skin in the game, put some skin in the game, support info wars dot com info wars store dot com and take part of the specials.
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:40.840]  You'll feel better to on top of all that.
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:44.840]  Now, last segment, which I couldn't for the life of me come up with a title for.
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:49.840]  I want to thank the fine folks at info wars for helping me out on that.
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:53.840]  I was talking about a I was talking about the history, really, how we got here.
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:56.840]  And don't forget, it was Cass Sunstein back in 09.
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:07.840]  And then there was that infamous but downplayed meeting in 2011, February 17, 2011 in San Francisco with all the tech giants along with along with Obama.
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:17.840]  And isn't it interesting now that that and I believe it was during that period of time that there was this gentleman's agreement or this agreement of sorts.
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:31.840]  The companies that came up with with a way to to shut down all of the speech, all of the information that was getting out and info wars was at the very top.
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:33.840]  And I like to think think we were too.
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:37.840]  And many and this affects to as well.
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:42.840]  This will affect if it hasn't done so already those people posting facts and information on Facebook.
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:46.840]  That is antithetical to the to the narrative.
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:47.840]  And of course, you know that.
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:55.840]  But the currently we see that the leftist the establishment the the not the deep state.
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:59.840]  They're labeling anyone who disagrees with them as hate speech.
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:07.840]  And this, as Alex has said, look at the timing of this 90 days right now, 89 days, 90 days before the midterm elections.
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:08.840]  Is that a coincidence?
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:09.840]  I think not.
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:13.840]  They cannot win in the free market of ideas.
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:15.840]  We they cannot argue.
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:19.840]  They cannot debate in the free market of ideas.
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:23.840]  This is why they want to censor their political opposition.
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:24.840]  And we saw this.
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:32.840]  Where do we see this before we saw this in the run up to the 2016 election with the opposition research and the dirt that was thrown at Donald Trump.
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:49.840]  And we know that info wars and they've been they made history in force made history and supported and was really effectively assisted in the election of Donald Trump.
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:52.840]  And that's I don't think anyone can argue that.
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:54.840]  Now it's payback time.
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:56.840]  It's payback by the deep state.
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:42:59.840]  So understand what is taking place here.
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:04.840]  And when I say that it's I don't mean to sound like I'm speaking down, but just understand what's taking place.
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:08.840]  And for those who are rejoicing in the banning, I've been seeing a lot of that.
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:10.840]  And I want to speak to that for a second.
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:11.840]  I've just got one word.
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:12.840]  Schadenfreude.
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:15.840]  I don't know how many people have ever heard that word.
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:16.840]  Schadenfreude.
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:21.840]  It's a German word in the meaning of which and perhaps I've spoken about it before the meaning of which is.
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:27.840]  Those people who derive pleasure from someone else's troubles.
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:32.840]  And if that is where and I see a lot of that and if that's where you're at.
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:35.840]  Well, that's a two way street.
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:50.840]  Trust me when I tell you because it's no fun when you are the recipient of the duct tape over your mouth or when they shut you down or when they file lawsuits against you for expressing your ideas.
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:55.840]  Or when they misrepresent even worse, misrepresent what you say in the marketplace.
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:57.840]  I'm a victim of that.
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:01.840]  I'm a victim of lawsuits as is info wars.
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:04.840]  It's the cheek thing to do right now.
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:06.840]  It's the way to silence the opposition.
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:14.840]  But you know what, just like Alex Jones, it doesn't make me want to crawl up in a fetal position like some snowflake.
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:18.840]  Frankly, it hacks me off and it makes me more determined to fight and fight.
[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:20.840]  I will fight.
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:21.840]  So allow Alex Jones.
[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:22.840]  So will info wars.
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:25.840]  So I'm proud of info wars.
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:27.840]  And I'm proud of the fight.
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:31.840]  I'm proud of the side that we're on in this fight.
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:44.840]  But I want to address another issue as well because I mentioned in the in the previous segment as well as this segment about the meeting and about the the fact that we're looking at.
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:52.840]  We're looking at private companies with a gross domestic product equivalent of $2.7 trillion.
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:53.840]  Think about that.
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:45:00.840]  Think about that in terms of the sovereign power that wields in the marketplace.
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:13.840]  When you see things operating when you see private companies operating in concert with with each other in a 12 hour span, you think about both antitrust law as well as anti monopoly laws and statutes.
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:15.840]  And there's a difference there.
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:19.840]  But without going into it, the bottom line is this.
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:26.840]  Some people would disagree and I tend to agree that we want to keep government out of the private marketplace.
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:32.840]  But there are some would agree that the the what we're seeing here is a violation of the of the antitrust laws.
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:36.840]  The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 to be precise.
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:56.840]  And if you look at if you look at that and you do some research of history, you'll find that the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 was a law passed by Congress under the presidency of Benjamin Harrison and regulated competition among enterprises.
[01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:06.840]  It's exactly what we're seeing today in an authorized Department of Justice to bring suits to enjoy, for example, to prohibit or that is to prohibit conduct violating the act.
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:13.840]  And additionally authorizes private parties injured by conduct violating the act to bring suits for treble damages.
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:16.840]  The reason I wanted to bring that up is because that's on the table here.
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:28.840]  I believe when you look at, as I said, the gross domestic product, 2.8 equivalent thereof 2.7 trillion dollars among four companies and the behavior of of I was going to say Osama bin Laden.
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:40.840]  The behavior of Barack Hussein Obama and the meetings that have that that took place, the nomination of Cass Sunstein, the all of that, the history.
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:52.840]  What was that all about? And then, of course, the payback because as Alex has said many times, and as I've said many times, the deep state, the shadow government refuses.
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:56.840]  They absolutely do not want a repeat of 2016.
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:46:57.840]  They can't afford it.
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:46:59.840]  They cannot lose in the midterms.
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:00.840]  They're all in.
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:13.840]  And I think if people understand what this is all about, elections have consequences and we're seeing the fruits of those consequences or the fruits of that election in the consequences right now.
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:24.840]  We're seeing the the vile unspeakable hatred by these anti Donald Trump supporters and anti Donald Trump people.
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:26.840]  They themselves are the Nazis.
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:27.840]  It's all coming out.
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:30.840]  And again, I mentioned shot before I know.
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:38.840]  Bottom line, if you take if you're taking some sort of pleasure in seeing this, well, it's it's to your own peril.
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:42.840]  And I've got a message finally for this segment.
[01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:53.840]  If in fact you think that this is a victory for your side for the deep state for the shadow government, get another thing coming because only makes us collectively stronger.
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:48:00.840]  It makes us collectively more determined and it makes us actually make this is off the couch.
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:06.840]  It's his way from our keyboards and we are going to be fighting back and fighting back like you've never seen.

[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:23.840]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:27.840]  to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:32.840]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:34.840]  It's made in the USA.
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:41.840]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the inflow war.
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:43.840]  It is a classical 360 win.

[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:27.840]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:30.840]  Years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment.
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:34.840]  Our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:38.840]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.

[01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:42.840]  Let's get started.
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:44.840]  Doug Hagman, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:50.840]  Doug Hagman, HagmanReport.com, sitting in for AlexInfoWars.com at the tip of the spear, obviously,
[01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:54.840]  making a difference in the marketplace.
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:59.840]  And as I spoke earlier about the censorship ban,
[01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:06.840]  and I want to get to a couple of other issues here, including some expansion about the New Mexico Islamist compound.
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:10.840]  I want to get to that here before the end of this segment.
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:15.840]  But I did find on the Daily Caller, and I'm not sure if Alex went over this or not,
[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:20.840]  but Twitter plans hate speech crackdown after backlash from upset employees.
[01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:24.840]  I want your binkies and blankets. That's right.
[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:28.840]  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Wednesday, yesterday,
[01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:30.840]  signaled a coming change to his company's speech policies,
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:33.840]  falling pressure from his own employees.
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:35.840]  So what can you say about this?
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:39.840]  So Twitter is next, although you've got the shout-out banning on Twitter,
[01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:44.840]  you've got all of the other issues, the censorship of political opponents,
[01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:50.840]  in and of itself, you've got the left yelling, collusion for crying out loud.
[01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:54.840]  Where's the collusion? The collusion is here with these companies,
[01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:56.840]  but now Twitter, of course, saying, oh, we're going to change some things.
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:58.840]  We're going to change some things.
[01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:01.840]  So they're planning to accelerate a crackdown on hate speech.
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:06.840]  Of course, hate speech, that's the key phrase, hate speech.
[01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:10.840]  You know, I'd like someone to define exactly what hate speech is.
[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:14.840]  What are the parameters? It's truly subjective.
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:18.840]  Paul Joseph Watson did videos on hate speech and what have you,
[01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:22.840]  but we're in a very dangerous time right now.
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:26.840]  And of course, as Alex Jones has said, and as I've said, they're coming,
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:29.840]  obviously, not just for your guns, but they're coming for you.
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:31.840]  Second Amendment, First Amendment, here it is.
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:36.840]  Which is why, by the way, you need to support this operation.
[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:41.840]  Brain force, 40% off, plus free shipping. I can't tell you what a difference that makes.
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:44.840]  If you're not taking brain force, you've got to be taking it.
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:49.840]  It offers clarity. Of course, you can't judge it by me, right?
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:54.840]  But as far as the clarity, the super male vitality, that makes a huge difference.
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:57.840]  All of the products make a great difference.
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:00.840]  But if you want to be in this fight and you want to stay in this fight,
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:01.840]  you've got to be healthy.
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:04.840]  So get yourself going with the products at InfoWars store.
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:07.840]  They've got a super special going on.
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:12.840]  The mainstream media, of course, are doing everything they can do to shut InfoWars down.
[01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:16.840]  Just wipe them, just erase them off the planet.
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:22.840]  While the tech giants work to remove InfoWars, remove us from the internet,
[01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:24.840]  InfoWars are dropping.
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:29.840]  They're already incredibly low prices and incredible products prices to help you support the InfoWars.
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:32.840]  So please do so. Get some skin on the game.
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:35.840]  So that's Twitter.
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:36.840]  And here it is.
[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:37.840]  It's Twitter.
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:39.840]  Changes are coming there.
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:44.840]  And I referenced, of course, the last segment about, do we really want government involved in this?
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:47.840]  But look toward the actions of Obama.
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:53.840]  Look toward the actions of all of the usual suspects as being involved in what you see.
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:54.840]  And how are we going to fight them?
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:56:00.840]  We're going to fight them with everything we got because they're not going to win, I guarantee you.
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:02.840]  We're not going to let them win.
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:06.840]  And I ask you, help us, support us.
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:16.840]  Now, one of the most important things, I think that in addition to the censorship, of course, is the infiltration.
[01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:24.840]  Alex talked about the Chai comms and the Chinese, of course, the espionage or the potential espionage,
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:31.840]  Dian Feinstein, we have the Democratic IT scandal with the Oman brothers.
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:35.840]  You've got all of this foreign influence in this country.
[01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:38.840]  But you've got something else as well.
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:43.840]  You've got now reported this week, New Mexico, the New Mexico compound,
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:46.840]  data rested at extremist Muslim note.
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:53.840]  They have to put a modifier there extremist extremist Muslim site trained kids to commit school shootings.
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:57:00.840]  And I spoke a little bit about this in the first segment with Alex, but I wanted just to connect some dots here.
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:09.840]  Because what we're seeing and what we've been screaming about for a long time are these Islamic training compounds.
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:20.840]  Now, this is rudimentary at best, but nonetheless, it doesn't take much to organize a group of school children,
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:28.840]  young children, show them how to use guns and then push them off to commit school shootings.
[01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:30.840]  Think about that for a second.
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:42.840]  The guy behind this particular camp, the Saraj Bin Wahaj, by the way, his son was reported missing
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:48.840]  and the remains of a boy found on the property are believed to be those of his son.
[01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:58.840]  And in addition to Saraj Bin Wahaj, you've got other individuals that were also arrested.
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:01.840]  But the big story here is this, and the big takeaway is this.
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:12.840]  All across the United States, you've got this infiltration of Islamic extremist Muslims who are intent on bringing down
[01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:18.840]  our representative republic in favor of a country or an area ruled by Sharia.
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:22.840]  They have no intention whatsoever of assimilation.
[01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:30.840]  You've got open borders which permit this invasion that's not limited to the Central American residents.
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:33.840]  It's not limited to residents of Mexico.
[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:44.840]  It's actually bringing forth individuals from the Middle East, from Yemen, from other Middle Eastern countries or South African countries.
[01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:53.840]  And as they come into this country, they hook up and they develop, but they hook up with people like Sheikh Mubarak Ali Jalani.
[01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:59.840]  They get involved with these organizations such as Jamat al-Fukhra.
[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:11.840]  And by the way, if Sheikh Mubarak Ali Jalani, if that name rings a bell, he's the Sheikh who Daniel Pearl was going to interview in Lahore, Pakistan
[01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:15.840]  when he was kidnapped and subsequently found beheaded.
[01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:24.840]  Now, the FBI, of course, cleared Jalani just to be clear, because I certainly don't need another lawsuit from Jalani.
[01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:31.840]  But just to be clear, Jalani, of course, was the man that Daniel Pearl was going to meet when he was kidnapped.
[01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:36.840]  But of course, the FBI cleared him of all suspicion.
[01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:42.840]  So what we have with this New Mexico compound is just a very tip of the iceberg.
[01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:44.840]  You've got numerous compounds all across the United States.
[01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:55.840]  I've documented one in Hancock, as I said, in Hancock, New York, which was actually at one time served as the headquarters of this Islamic group called Jamat al-Fukhra.
[01:59:55.840 --> 02:00:05.840]  And as I said before, Dr. Paul Williams and myself, we've written extensively about it.
[02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:17.840]  These training compounds, they host paramilitary training, they host armories for lack of a better term.
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:29.840]  And as I said, school buses, my goodness, the one in Hancock, New York, I've shown on InfoWars, where school buses were in fact used, a school bus was used for practice.
[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:52.840]  Keep your eye on this, because as we see the continued banning of the truth, you're going to see there's a relationship between the exposure of the truth and the suppression of the truth.
[02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:53.840]  And that's what we're seeing today.
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:57.840]  The more that we expose, the more they've got to ban.
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:06.840]  So look for additional information from this particular training compound and this story as it spreads across the United States.
[02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:15.840]  Just to be clear, when I turned over back in, when I did my investigation of the Hancock report and I turned that information over to the FBI,
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:27.840]  Sheikh Jalani was notified ostensibly by the FBI after I turned my report in and hence I've got a religious statement filed against me still on the internet.
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:28.840]  You can read it.
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:30.840]  I'm not sure exactly where it is, but it's out there.
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:33.840]  And that gave me a visit from the FBI.
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:42.840]  A couple of agents said, you know what, we can't provide you security, but we wish you well and be careful and increase your security.
[02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:46.840]  So this is what we as American citizens face today.
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:53.840]  And that, by the way, was under the Bush administration and it continued even worse under Obama.
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:02:02.840]  So in closing, as I wrap as I wrap this up, and I'm so honored by the way to be to be here for Alex Jones, especially at a time like this.
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:08.840]  And for info wars, especially a time like this, as I wrap this up, we are engaged in civil war.
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:11.840]  We're engaged in an asymmetrical warfare.
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:15.840]  And I'm going to close with this question.
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:19.840]  What could be worse than a civil war?
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:24.840]  I would say possibly not having a civil war.
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:27.840]  I'd like you to think about that.
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:29.840]  As you finish your week.
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:33.840]  And as we play really for all the marbles.
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:35.840]  And we are playing for all the marbles.
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:37.840]  They certainly are.
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:42.840]  The fascists, the Nazis, the deep state are playing for all the marbles.
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:44.840]  Folks, thank you so much.
