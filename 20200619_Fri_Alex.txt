[00:00:44.457 --> 00:00:47.418]  Welcome, it's the 19th of June, 2020.
[00:00:47.418 --> 00:00:50.079]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:51.619]  Today we've got a lot to talk about.
[00:00:51.619 --> 00:01:00.002]  We have a lot of CEOs who are using June 10th to push division in civil war, I think, not reconciliation.
[00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:00.862]  So we're going to talk about that.
[00:01:00.862 --> 00:01:07.664]  We've got a lot to talk about with the Supreme Court decision that hit yesterday afternoon.
[00:01:07.664 --> 00:01:09.925]  Absolutely amazing, but not unexpected.
[00:01:10.984 --> 00:01:17.126]  As I've been saying, as this thing's been winding its way through the courts, why is President Trump even doing this?
[00:01:17.126 --> 00:01:23.207]  They don't have the authority to make a decision about this, and I'll tell you why later in the program.
[00:01:23.207 --> 00:01:27.968]  But Clarence Thomas was spot on in what he said about this.
[00:01:27.968 --> 00:01:30.469]  It is absolutely astonishing.
[00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:39.051]  But as we look at the continual kneeling, we have Klobuchar on Juneteenth that decides that she doesn't like Martin Luther King.
[00:01:39.591 --> 00:01:45.294]  Yeah, Martin Luther King said we want to judge people by the content of their character, not by the color of their skin.
[00:01:45.294 --> 00:01:57.882]  But Klobuchar wants to take herself out of the veep stakes, the running for vice president, says Biden should pick a woman of color because it doesn't matter.
[00:01:57.882 --> 00:01:59.483]  Nothing matters more than skin color now.
[00:01:59.483 --> 00:02:08.308]  I mean, you know, we are now embracing full racism, which is why Dick Van Dyke is now being condemned over his blackface appearance
[00:02:09.147 --> 00:02:11.729]  And Mary Poppins.
[00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:13.571]  Yeah, okay, this is satire.
[00:02:13.571 --> 00:02:17.014]  But you, I had you there for a moment, didn't I?
[00:02:17.014 --> 00:02:18.996]  When I first saw it, I thought it was real too.
[00:02:18.996 --> 00:02:21.778]  Yeah, it's absolutely a satire site.
[00:02:21.778 --> 00:02:23.800]  Southendnewsnetwork.net.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.725]  But folks, we're not that far away from satire.
[00:02:29.725 --> 00:02:31.767]  You know, Northam has gotten away with it.
[00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:33.949]  I mean, you know, Northam really did the blackface.
[00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:35.991]  It looks like Howard Stern is going to get away with it as well.
[00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:43.347]  But on the satire site, South End News Network, they said Michelle Garage said she was disgusted and horrified.
[00:02:43.347 --> 00:02:47.709]  You can't even use the excuse it was acceptable in the 1960s.
[00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.072]  As Disney, you should have had the cultural foresight to realize it would have been offensive 40 years later.
[00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:57.354]  You know, when we look at this, and again, why is he in blackface?
[00:02:57.354 --> 00:03:00.856]  Just so that we don't get the Twitter mob started.
[00:03:00.856 --> 00:03:05.339]  If you go back and look at it, you might realize that he was actually working as a chimney sweep.
[00:03:06.212 --> 00:03:08.934]  You know we have, I guess they're going to shut down the coal mines.
[00:03:08.934 --> 00:03:11.356]  They got another reason to shut down the coal mines.
[00:03:11.356 --> 00:03:18.903]  And not only are we all going to die from carbon dioxide from coal plants, but you know all those people who work in the mines?
[00:03:18.903 --> 00:03:20.484]  They come out every day in blackface.
[00:03:20.484 --> 00:03:24.427]  They must be having some kind of a party down there in the coal mines.
[00:03:24.427 --> 00:03:26.289]  We've got to stop this right now.
[00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.130]  That overt racism.
[00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.554]  These guys who are getting, they're getting black lung as well as blackface down there working in the coal mines.
[00:03:32.554 --> 00:03:33.715]  We've got to stop that.
[00:03:33.715 --> 00:03:35.096]  Maybe they should start wearing masks.
[00:03:36.107 --> 00:03:41.691]  As a matter of fact, Arnold Schwarzenegger's telling everybody you gotta wear masks.
[00:03:41.691 --> 00:03:46.934]  It's a political, making it a political issue, you absolute morons!
[00:03:46.934 --> 00:03:48.355]  Says the absolute moron.
[00:03:48.355 --> 00:03:54.299]  This is not satire, this is just Schwarzenegger being moronic, as usual.
[00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.900]  This will beat the terrible virus.
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.843]  The science is unanimous, if we all wear masks, we slow down the spread.
[00:04:01.827 --> 00:04:04.228]  You gotta save da planet!
[00:04:04.228 --> 00:04:05.549]  You need to bring back Greta!
[00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.651]  You know, he just did his tour with Greta.
[00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:11.532]  So, the two of them, they can save the planet.
[00:04:11.532 --> 00:04:19.856]  But we're being told this, seriously we're being told this, by Reuters, by all of the propaganda press, formerly known as mainstream media.
[00:04:19.856 --> 00:04:23.078]  I don't give them that much respect anymore.
[00:04:23.078 --> 00:04:24.439]  They're not mainstream.
[00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:29.141]  They're way out of the mainstream of rationality.
[00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:30.382]  They're just propaganda press.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.365]  And they're now saying it may save your life.
[00:04:34.365 --> 00:04:34.967]  More U.S.
[00:04:34.967 --> 00:04:36.450]  states are mandating masks.
[00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.795]  We'll talk about that and many other things when we come back.
[00:04:38.795 --> 00:04:39.917]  Stay with us.
[00:04:39.917 --> 00:04:40.518]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.362 --> 00:05:04.384]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System.
[00:05:04.384 --> 00:05:05.965]  The first of its kind.
[00:05:05.965 --> 00:05:10.948]  Pure, nascent, atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray bottle.
[00:05:10.948 --> 00:05:13.949]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here.
[00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.051]  Introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:20.132]  The great part about the X2 Spray is it's great on the go.
[00:05:20.132 --> 00:05:22.634]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house.
[00:05:23.194 --> 00:05:25.436]  You know, great at work, but this is great for the car.
[00:05:25.436 --> 00:05:27.417]  It's great to keep with you.
[00:05:27.417 --> 00:05:33.702]  And, again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[00:05:33.702 --> 00:05:35.404]  We're really excited about it.
[00:05:35.404 --> 00:05:37.405]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[00:05:37.405 --> 00:05:48.895]  It was a listener's idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new and, in some ways, even better way.
[00:05:49.335 --> 00:05:59.754]  Get your Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine Spray now at 33% off at Infowarsstore.com and experience the power of aerosolized X2 Nascent Iodine for yourself!
[00:06:24.196 --> 00:06:26.977]  It's June 19th, Year of Our Lord 2020.
[00:06:26.977 --> 00:06:28.157]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:06:28.157 --> 00:06:34.078]  We're going to take a look at racial issues, which, surprise, are on the front page again.
[00:06:34.078 --> 00:06:37.639]  Because today is Juneteenth, and so we're going to talk about what the CEOs are doing.
[00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:43.781]  We're also going to talk about the push to enslave people with masks again.
[00:06:43.781 --> 00:06:50.723]  We now have Key West is now saying they've extended mandatory masks until June 2021 for another year!
[00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:56.108]  Do they have some new science or something?
[00:06:56.108 --> 00:07:01.132]  Are they talking to people with crystal balls instead about this?
[00:07:01.132 --> 00:07:03.354]  They're going to extend this for another year?
[00:07:03.354 --> 00:07:06.156]  It's absolutely insane.
[00:07:06.156 --> 00:07:17.065]  But before we get to that, there is another plan that has been working out for a long time and Alex Jones has an update on the plan to push pedophilia.
[00:07:17.065 --> 00:07:18.987]  Here's Alex Jones.
[00:07:18.987 --> 00:07:20.368]  Alfred Kinsey.
[00:07:21.394 --> 00:07:22.655]  B.F.
[00:07:22.655 --> 00:07:42.482]  Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and many others known as the founders of modern psychology and psychiatry were all self-avowed perverts, degenerates, and pedophiles, particularly the first two men that I mentioned.
[00:07:42.482 --> 00:07:50.486]  You can go look it up for yourself that they ran major institutions, major institutes,
[00:07:51.448 --> 00:08:06.002]  Particularly in the case of Kinsey, where they kept children in cages for the first 10 or 15 years of their life, where they did surgeries on children, where they had sex with children, where they did it all.
[00:08:06.562 --> 00:08:11.205]  Now, these men are worshipped by Hollywood and the left.
[00:08:11.205 --> 00:08:15.749]  Now you understand why Hollywood's obsessed with pedophilia.
[00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:27.898]  Now you understand why it's all coming out and why it's in Build That Broke It, and Der Spiegel, and BBC, and London Independent, you name it, that for 30 plus years, more than 10 children
[00:08:28.678 --> 00:08:38.753]  What was the goal of this Berlin top psychiatrist?
[00:08:38.753 --> 00:08:42.017]  Well, it was the same goal of the pedophile cult.
[00:08:42.017 --> 00:08:44.621]  He believed, this is in the news, this is admitted,
[00:08:45.282 --> 00:08:56.436]  That they were going to create the ultimate family by children being taken from biological nuclear families that he said were bad and given to the pedophiles who could give children the ultimate love of sex.
[00:08:56.436 --> 00:09:00.581]  And he believed that sex with small children was loving and would form a new family.
[00:09:01.101 --> 00:09:13.632]  Where generally same-sex groups, man with a boy, woman with a girl, would form these wonderful relationships for the new future of our new LGBT system.
[00:09:13.632 --> 00:09:23.781]  And so at the heart of all this is pedophilia and targeting your children to create this new family structure, which of course only reproduces by stealing other people's children.
[00:09:24.321 --> 00:09:28.845]  This is the true evil of this conspiracy that is now public.
[00:09:28.845 --> 00:09:29.966]  Now that's all coming out.
[00:09:29.966 --> 00:09:33.650]  It was trending on Twitter last night that Alex Jones was right in all this.
[00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:37.053]  Ladies and gentlemen, they know this is coming out because the victims are speaking out.
[00:09:37.053 --> 00:09:42.318]  They're acting like this one psychiatrist that ran part of the health service in Berlin was doing it.
[00:09:42.318 --> 00:09:43.318]  It was just him.
[00:09:43.318 --> 00:09:44.399]  No, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.101]  It's done all over the Western world.
[00:09:48.101 --> 00:09:50.742]  That's what drag queen pedophile story time's about.
[00:09:50.742 --> 00:09:54.864]  That's why Nickelodeon came out 10 years ago and said, we're going to sexualize your kids.
[00:09:54.864 --> 00:09:58.645]  Oh, you know, the gay rights movement only want to be able to get married.
[00:09:58.645 --> 00:10:00.946]  Now they want access to your kids.
[00:10:00.946 --> 00:10:04.507]  At the top of this or at the bottom of it is pedophilia.
[00:10:04.507 --> 00:10:06.668]  And it's just that simple.
[00:10:06.668 --> 00:10:08.709]  And people have to come to grips with it.
[00:10:09.602 --> 00:10:16.686]  You know, just this morning, I was getting all these calls and text messages, people saying, why aren't you covering this while I'm on vacation?
[00:10:16.686 --> 00:10:22.089]  But before I cut this report, I said, let me go back and just refresh myself on Alfred Kinsey.
[00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:23.890]  Well, I went and refreshed myself.
[00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.130]  It was worse than I thought.
[00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:30.954]  Just type in his name, Alfred Kinsey, and you get to see Google and everybody just fawning over him.
[00:10:30.954 --> 00:10:33.215]  Surprised they haven't had a Google doodle for him.
[00:10:33.935 --> 00:10:48.376]  Alfred Charles Kinsey was an American biologist, professor of zoology, sexologist, who in 1947 founded the Institute for Sex Research at Indiana University, previously known as the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction.
[00:10:48.376 --> 00:10:49.037]  And if you want to know
[00:10:49.958 --> 00:11:01.610]  Where the transgenderism comes from, and where the sexualization of children comes from, and where all the sex ed, telling your five-year-old boy he might be a girl, your five-year-old girl she might be something else.
[00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.313]  This is an assault on innocence.
[00:11:04.313 --> 00:11:09.879]  And if you just research the things that Kinsey and others did, it's so monstrous.
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.706]  But the biggest thing they would do is keep children confined in dog cages.
[00:11:14.706 --> 00:11:16.389]  It's one of their favorite things to do.
[00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:20.455]  In fact, one of these guys did it to his own son.
[00:11:20.455 --> 00:11:23.860]  Just like Aleister Crowley reportedly sacrificed his own son.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.162]  That's what these people do.
[00:11:26.351 --> 00:11:29.733]  And so you need to understand that they didn't invent all this in the modern world.
[00:11:29.733 --> 00:11:38.479]  They were codifying it for the pedophile networks that royalty and others are connected to for social control in this giant satanic scheme.
[00:11:38.479 --> 00:11:43.522]  And so now you know why Bill Gates is hanging out in Europe and hanging out in the U.S.
[00:11:43.522 --> 00:11:46.043]  at Jeffrey Epstein's house and then trying to cover it up.
[00:11:46.043 --> 00:11:50.146]  Now you know how they were blackmailing the scientists to be under the scientific control right now.
[00:11:50.686 --> 00:11:50.846]  I don't
[00:12:10.103 --> 00:12:11.385]  Do to you what they will.
[00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:30.613]  And then I was talking to a fellow just the other day who was high level in the CIA and some other agencies and groups.
[00:12:30.613 --> 00:12:34.014]  And he was saying, yeah, you're probably going to be dead soon, is the word.
[00:12:34.014 --> 00:12:38.235]  That's okay, because I don't put kids in cages and I don't rape them.
[00:12:38.235 --> 00:12:39.515]  So go ahead.
[00:12:39.515 --> 00:12:40.855]  I'm in God's hands.
[00:12:40.855 --> 00:12:45.076]  I want people to know that if I get killed or I get in prison or I get indicted or I get set up, I'm not a loser.
[00:12:45.076 --> 00:12:46.157]  I'm a winner.
[00:12:46.157 --> 00:12:47.277]  I did the right thing.
[00:12:47.277 --> 00:12:48.797]  I stood up for what was right.
[00:12:48.797 --> 00:12:51.898]  And more people need to have courage and say no to this because these children are under attack.
[00:12:52.745 --> 00:12:53.325]  Okay.
[00:12:53.325 --> 00:13:02.271]  And I didn't just get this from, you know, people in the federal government warning me that, my God, they're really, you know, talking about how you're enemy number one because I'm exposing all this and I've really pissed Bill Gates off.
[00:13:02.271 --> 00:13:02.731]  That's fine.
[00:13:02.731 --> 00:13:04.052]  Somebody's got to stamp this monster.
[00:13:04.052 --> 00:13:15.198]  But I also know a lot of other behind-the-scenes stuff that has confirmed that the deep state Democrat pedophile arm is actually convened, you know, trying to have me arrested right now.
[00:13:15.198 --> 00:13:18.120]  It even came out four years ago that Nancy Pelosi's daughter
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:25.704]  Was on Capitol Hill demanding I be arrested, and that was even later admitted on Fox News, and they lied about me and said that I was death-threatening Pelosi and her.
[00:13:25.704 --> 00:13:35.050]  No, what I was doing was saying they are secretly trying to get the delegates to not seat Trump, I think it was January 8th, ahead of his January 20th, 2017 inauguration, which was true.
[00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:35.831]  It later came out it was true.
[00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:47.318]  They were so pissed that we exposed it and got it out that they wanted me in prisons because they know, time and time again, it's Infowars and this crew and this audience that boosts the information here, and yours truly,
[00:13:48.098 --> 00:14:10.599]  that are able to get these truths out and then they see the chain reaction that brings them down so whatever happens to me just keep fighting keep exposing don't back down ladies and gentlemen because god demands we stand up for the children these monsters are coming for everybody anyways there'll be no civilization left once they have their way it's us or them we have to realize how evil they are in this giant pedophile conspiracy they're running and we just have to pray
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:18.486]  For God's Spirit to come to the world and for people to turn away from their wicked ways and seek God's face and find that quiet place, the Most High that King David talked about.
[00:14:18.486 --> 00:14:24.412]  And I just pray that you'll pray for me and my family as well, because we are doing important work and we are under amazing attack.
[00:14:24.412 --> 00:14:26.974]  And I couldn't do this without your prayers and God's support.
[00:14:26.974 --> 00:14:28.035]  I really appreciate you all.
[00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:30.016]  But yes, ladies and gentlemen, I'm begging you.
[00:14:30.965 --> 00:14:33.606]  Go read about these psychologists and these psychiatrists.
[00:14:33.606 --> 00:14:35.287]  You know, David Knight's a great researcher.
[00:14:35.287 --> 00:14:36.547]  I know David knows all about it.
[00:14:36.547 --> 00:14:42.389]  I mean, perhaps he can come on the show next Monday or something for an hour and he can compile a lot of the quotes and statements by these guys.
[00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:45.831]  When you hear me saying all this, it sounds unreal because you're not like that.
[00:14:46.371 --> 00:14:48.874]  But they really do this and more, okay?
[00:14:48.874 --> 00:15:01.847]  And they're here to normalize sex with children, to be able to have the state and these pedophile priesthoods come and have sex with your children as a sacrament, and to ruin their lives, and then to bind your children to them in a cult, a sex cult with your children.
[00:15:02.607 --> 00:15:11.854]  It's a family of them, a pedophile sex family, and that's what the psychiatrist in Berlin was setting up following Alfred Kinsey and others' operations.
[00:15:11.854 --> 00:15:18.419]  But Freud, all of them, these are a sick group of devil worshippers, obsessed with the most gross stuff you could ever imagine.
[00:15:18.419 --> 00:15:22.623]  They're totally turned over to evil, and living in denial, ladies and gentlemen, is only going to destroy you, okay?
[00:15:23.399 --> 00:15:24.580]  They're coming for your children.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.301]  They're coming for you.
[00:15:25.301 --> 00:15:26.702]  They're coming for your bloodline.
[00:15:26.702 --> 00:15:27.602]  They're coming for your genetics.
[00:15:27.602 --> 00:15:30.325]  They're coming to rape your very DNA.
[00:15:30.325 --> 00:15:31.065]  They are demonic.
[00:15:31.065 --> 00:15:32.967]  They are the spawn of hell itself.
[00:15:34.221 --> 00:15:37.304]  This is a live report, but later when it's archived, banned on video.
[00:15:37.304 --> 00:15:39.666]  Please remember, the only way this gets out is you.
[00:15:39.666 --> 00:15:40.787]  This is the rest of the story.
[00:15:40.787 --> 00:15:45.331]  It exposes their satanic blackmail rings that control the system, but it's beyond that.
[00:15:45.331 --> 00:15:46.792]  That's just a control system.
[00:15:46.792 --> 00:15:47.973]  It is their religion.
[00:15:47.973 --> 00:15:50.015]  We must admit that Satan's real.
[00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:55.900]  We must fight the satanic conspiracy with all of our will, and with God's promise and spirit of the Holy Ghost shining through us.
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.301]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:15:57.301 --> 00:15:57.962]  Thank you all.
[00:15:57.962 --> 00:15:59.123]  God bless, and good luck.
[00:16:00.489 --> 00:16:13.339]  We're already in the latter part of June, and of course most of the country's not completely reopened again, and already Fauci and the UN Bill of Melinda Gates criminal combine are telling us don't go to Trump rallies.
[00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:20.785]  Oh no, but the very same media that promotes that we shouldn't go to Trump rallies is telling us we should go to the Democrat Party black
[00:16:20.845 --> 00:16:21.525]  All lives matter.
[00:16:21.525 --> 00:16:23.407]  All white people are evil.
[00:16:23.407 --> 00:16:24.507]  Mind control.
[00:16:24.507 --> 00:16:25.868]  Brainwashing events.
[00:16:25.868 --> 00:16:29.791]  This is the attempted murder of common sense and logic.
[00:16:29.791 --> 00:16:39.437]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to be more politically active than you ever have because we are going into hardcore United Nations controlled bondage.
[00:16:39.437 --> 00:16:48.924]  Major police departments like Los Angeles and Albuquerque, New Mexico are announcing they're going under UN control and turning their, quote, police into community activist organizers.
[00:16:49.304 --> 00:16:50.806]  This is just the beginning.
[00:16:50.806 --> 00:16:53.890]  Everything's gonna accelerate now from this point out.
[00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:55.092]  So, it's here.
[00:16:55.092 --> 00:16:55.793]  No more games.
[00:16:55.793 --> 00:16:57.135]  The New World Order has arrived.
[00:16:59.778 --> 00:17:00.798]  It's finally here.
[00:17:00.798 --> 00:17:05.641]  Introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true atomic iodine.
[00:17:05.641 --> 00:17:12.263]  Lister's have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[00:17:12.263 --> 00:17:14.304]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[00:17:14.304 --> 00:17:23.128]  Our proprietary new Aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[00:17:23.388 --> 00:17:29.895]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power of truthnascent iodine working for my body.
[00:17:29.895 --> 00:17:31.477]  I can personally feel the difference.
[00:17:31.477 --> 00:17:39.345]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[00:17:39.585 --> 00:17:44.407]  Iodine may also support your body and healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[00:17:44.407 --> 00:17:49.428]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of true nascent iodine today.
[00:17:49.428 --> 00:17:56.891]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 spray for 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com before we sell out of our new limited first shipment.

[00:18:02.393 --> 00:18:05.054]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:17.256 --> 00:18:19.518]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[00:18:19.518 --> 00:18:25.764]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:25.764 --> 00:18:38.035]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[00:18:38.035 --> 00:18:38.436]  Welcome back.
[00:18:38.436 --> 00:18:42.760]  You heard that report from Alex Jones, talking about the experiment.
[00:18:43.681 --> 00:18:45.502]  It was conducted in Germany.
[00:18:45.502 --> 00:18:54.605]  They said, well, just to see how this works out, we'll put some kids with some known pedophiles, and we'll show that it really doesn't hurt to have that happen.
[00:18:54.605 --> 00:19:08.490]  And as Alex was talking about the long, sordid history of the McKenzie Institute there at the University of Indiana, I'll just throw this in as a connection to politics.
[00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:09.331]  Perhaps you remember
[00:19:10.322 --> 00:19:15.045]  Just before the 2018 midterm elections, there was a lot of purging of websites.
[00:19:15.045 --> 00:19:21.108]  There was also a lot of purging of social media, especially Facebook pages and so forth.
[00:19:21.108 --> 00:19:27.652]  The middle of October, just before, you know, just a couple weeks before the election, that was the October surprise.
[00:19:27.652 --> 00:19:29.453]  Hey, you're all gone!
[00:19:29.453 --> 00:19:30.553]  Shut everybody down.
[00:19:30.553 --> 00:19:37.337]  They took out about, they went after the social media sites of about 800 different organizations.
[00:19:37.337 --> 00:19:37.918]  Most of them
[00:19:40.226 --> 00:19:44.408]  Most of them were Trump, but not all of them were Trump supporters.
[00:19:44.408 --> 00:19:49.310]  What they had in common was that they opposed foreign wars.
[00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.391]  You know, conservatives and liberals can do that.
[00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:55.973]  Conservatives and liberals can also oppose the surveillance state and the police state.
[00:19:55.973 --> 00:19:58.774]  That seemed to be the common thread.
[00:19:58.774 --> 00:20:00.995]  But they said there's another common thread.
[00:20:00.995 --> 00:20:04.457]  They said, oh, these people, some of them, they said, we just don't like their content.
[00:20:04.457 --> 00:20:04.897]  They're hateful.
[00:20:07.509 --> 00:20:10.651]  Continuous foreign wars and they hate an Orwellian society.
[00:20:10.651 --> 00:20:11.792]  So we got to get rid of them.
[00:20:11.792 --> 00:20:13.813]  Because that's what we've got in mind for you.
[00:20:13.813 --> 00:20:15.414]  Forever.
[00:20:15.414 --> 00:20:18.936]  A boot stomping on your face forever.
[00:20:18.936 --> 00:20:28.622]  But they also got rid of a lot of purged tens of thousands of social media sites declaring them to be bots.
[00:20:28.622 --> 00:20:36.667]  And it was kind of interesting because the list of social media sites that were declared bots were provided by the DNC.
[00:20:37.793 --> 00:20:39.254]  To the social media companies.
[00:20:39.254 --> 00:20:40.474]  And where did the DNC get it?
[00:20:40.474 --> 00:20:42.475]  Oh, well, they didn't just make this up, did they?
[00:20:42.475 --> 00:20:43.875]  No, no, no.
[00:20:43.875 --> 00:20:45.216]  Actually, they didn't.
[00:20:45.216 --> 00:20:51.398]  There is a associate with the Kinsey Institute, and here's the association.
[00:20:51.398 --> 00:20:57.341]  The guy who runs this is a fellow of the Kinsey Institute, but it's coming out of the University of Indiana.
[00:20:57.341 --> 00:21:05.764]  You know, the Kinsey sex pervert section there is a... I guess you could call it a school.
[00:21:07.928 --> 00:21:14.393]  When I went to school, University of South Florida, they had School of Engineering, they had School of Business and so forth.
[00:21:14.393 --> 00:21:20.358]  Well, I guess they got the School of Pervs at Indiana University, McKinsey Institute.
[00:21:20.358 --> 00:21:32.427]  And they brought a guy over from Italy who was going to be a social media expert, but he just happened to, you know, because he's a social media expert, I guess they put him there on, you know, part of the board there for the McKinsey Institute.
[00:21:32.427 --> 00:21:34.088]  And they have a thing called Oh So Me.
[00:21:36.158 --> 00:21:37.879]  About social media.
[00:21:37.879 --> 00:21:42.101]  They also have another thing that they do that called Bot or Not.
[00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:44.922]  And so they have these algorithms and they're the ones, you know, the people.
[00:21:44.922 --> 00:21:47.104]  This guy is affiliated with the Kenzie Institute.
[00:21:47.104 --> 00:21:50.385]  He's going to decide whether or not you get to speak.
[00:21:50.385 --> 00:21:54.947]  Maybe that explains some of their censorship, you think?
[00:21:54.947 --> 00:21:58.669]  But of course, highly connected to the Democrat Party as well.
[00:21:58.669 --> 00:22:01.611]  I want to get into what is happening today with Juneteenth.
[00:22:02.674 --> 00:22:08.897]  Because we've got a lot of CEOs and we've got Democrats who are pushing for this to be a federal holiday.
[00:22:08.897 --> 00:22:17.822]  I think if you look at what they're pushing though, I think what they're really pushing is division and a coming race war.
[00:22:17.822 --> 00:22:21.664]  I said this immediately as soon as people focused
[00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:31.216]  On the George Floyd death, I said, they're going to use this to really start a race war.
[00:22:31.216 --> 00:22:34.499]  As people are locked down, as people are frustrated, this is what they're going to do.
[00:22:34.499 --> 00:22:40.104]  And I said it immediately, and within a day or two, they had the riots going.
[00:22:40.104 --> 00:22:46.910]  Now, I want to play for you a video clip of Chick-fil-A's CEO.
[00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:49.452]  And it is absolutely stunning what he does.
[00:22:50.814 --> 00:23:17.346]  on a program uh... well just i'll just let you see what he has to say let's play video clip number one some are closing moments here but a story that was share with me by a dear friend he share with me about a revival that was taking place in a church in texas and uh... at that revival in the front seat was a over african-american uh... over african-american american man man that's sitting there and this young man got up
[00:23:18.166 --> 00:23:31.219]  That was there in that service, and he'd been so gripped with conviction about the racism that was in that local community in a small town in Texas, that he took a shoe brush
[00:23:32.339 --> 00:23:38.221]  And he walked over to this elderly gentleman and he knelt on his knees and began to shine his shoes.
[00:23:38.221 --> 00:23:42.583]  And tears began to flow in that service.
[00:23:42.583 --> 00:23:46.004]  It was an attitude of conviction.
[00:23:46.004 --> 00:23:51.206]  So I invite folks just to put some words to action here.
[00:23:51.206 --> 00:23:55.048]  And if we need to find somebody that needs to have their shoes shined, we need
[00:23:58.558 --> 00:23:59.559]  Maybe I won't.
[00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:26.932]  You know, this is... I bought 1,500 of these and I gave it to all our chip play operators and staff.
[00:24:26.932 --> 00:24:28.793]  We got 1,500 of them.
[00:24:28.793 --> 00:24:40.659]  And so any expressions of a contrite heart, of a sense of humility, a sense of shame, a sense of embarrassment, begin with an apologetic heart.
[00:24:40.659 --> 00:24:41.099]  I think that's...
[00:24:41.986 --> 00:24:43.747]  Okay, so there you go.
[00:24:43.747 --> 00:24:45.709]  That's his brush with racism.
[00:24:45.709 --> 00:24:47.450]  Oh, I guess we could say.
[00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:51.073]  His brush with white privilege.
[00:24:51.073 --> 00:24:55.696]  It goes over to Lecrae, and so there's three people on stage for those of you listening.
[00:24:55.696 --> 00:25:03.902]  Three people on stage, the Christian rapper Lecrae, a black man, a pastor, Louis Jiglio, I think is the way you pronounce his name.
[00:25:03.902 --> 00:25:07.845]  He has a big mega church there in Atlanta.
[00:25:08.843 --> 00:25:15.647]  And then you have Kathy, who is the son of the founder of Chick-fil-A.
[00:25:15.647 --> 00:25:17.928]  Another spoiled, rich, guilty, white liberal.
[00:25:17.928 --> 00:25:20.790]  This ain't his daddy's Chick-fil-A, folks.
[00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:21.610]  Gonna eat more chicken?
[00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:23.931]  You gonna shine more shoes?
[00:25:23.931 --> 00:25:24.632]  What's this about?
[00:25:24.632 --> 00:25:27.433]  I mean, that is one of the most pathetic things I've ever seen.
[00:25:27.433 --> 00:25:30.795]  This is coming... Let me give you some context here.
[00:25:30.795 --> 00:25:33.116]  Because there's a lot of context going on.
[00:25:33.116 --> 00:25:34.097]  This is in Atlanta.
[00:25:35.806 --> 00:25:45.289]  And as he goes through this, some of the other comments that he made, you saw that cringeworthy display of virtue signaling going on there.
[00:25:45.289 --> 00:25:50.851]  He urged white people, this Chick-fil-A CEO, white people repent of their racism.
[00:25:50.851 --> 00:25:52.952]  Because, you know, you are racist if you're white.
[00:25:52.952 --> 00:25:53.392]  That's just it.
[00:25:55.592 --> 00:25:59.294]  He justified rioters looting and burning down a Wendy's restaurant in Atlanta.
[00:25:59.294 --> 00:26:08.259]  We, as Caucasians, until we're willing to just pick up the baton and fight for our black African-American brothers and sisters, which they are as one human race, well, he got that right.
[00:26:08.259 --> 00:26:11.020]  But he said, until we fight for them, we're shameful.
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:20.905]  Well, actually, you know, I tweeted out, when I talked about that I was going to be doing the show today for Alex as a guest host, I tweeted out a meme.
[00:26:20.905 --> 00:26:23.767]  And that meme shows a young white girl
[00:26:25.191 --> 00:26:28.373]  And a young Asian girl.
[00:26:28.373 --> 00:26:33.337]  And it says, does this young white girl, does she need to apologize for slavery?
[00:26:33.337 --> 00:26:39.602]  If she does, does this young Japanese girl, does she need to apologize for Pearl Harbor?
[00:26:39.602 --> 00:26:41.023]  That's the mentality.
[00:26:41.023 --> 00:26:42.744]  That's the mentality, folks.
[00:26:42.744 --> 00:26:44.846]  That's what's being pushed by this guy.
[00:26:44.846 --> 00:26:51.791]  We'll talk more about this, and what these other CEOs are doing around the country, and of course what Nancy Pelosi and Kamala Harris are doing as well.
[00:26:51.791 --> 00:26:52.672]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:26:57.116 --> 00:26:59.558]  I was talking to my patron supplier, Great Suppliers.
[00:26:59.558 --> 00:27:02.500]  You can now say four weeks on average for storable food.
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.561]  It's the highest quality.
[00:27:03.561 --> 00:27:05.002]  They've got it.
[00:27:05.002 --> 00:27:11.386]  Use this little rest we have, caught in the current, to come up to the surface, get some air, before you get sucked back down.
[00:27:11.386 --> 00:27:13.928]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[00:27:13.928 --> 00:27:17.270]  I have to now start going into defense posture.
[00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:20.232]  80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense.
[00:27:20.232 --> 00:27:22.113]  Trying to fully, you know, stop the Globeless.
[00:27:22.113 --> 00:27:25.456]  I mean, give them a good run, and I think down the road they'll be defeated, but
[00:27:26.667 --> 00:27:29.449]  We're going to still go down the hard road now.
[00:27:29.449 --> 00:27:35.353]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still going to be bad in my view.

[00:27:57.694 --> 00:27:59.436]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[00:27:59.436 --> 00:27:59.937]  You're on the air.
[00:27:59.937 --> 00:28:01.519]  Thanks for holding.
[00:28:01.519 --> 00:28:02.160]  I sure can, sir.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:02.480]  Thank you.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.324]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[00:28:13.474 --> 00:28:14.935]  I just want to plug in.
[00:28:14.935 --> 00:28:19.359]  I'm a truck driver and two befores have changed the way I drive.
[00:28:19.359 --> 00:28:25.984]  Me and my brothers that drive, a couple of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[00:28:25.984 --> 00:28:33.951]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank
[00:28:34.031 --> 00:28:34.752]  Thank you for that, man.
[00:28:34.752 --> 00:28:40.396]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[00:28:40.396 --> 00:28:42.678]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[00:28:42.678 --> 00:28:45.160]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.823]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[00:28:47.823 --> 00:28:51.866]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[00:28:51.866 --> 00:28:53.648]  And you're saying that it's made your life better?
[00:28:53.648 --> 00:28:54.388]  So that means a lot to me.
[00:28:54.388 --> 00:28:54.749]  Thank you.
[00:28:54.749 --> 00:28:56.170]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[00:28:57.694 --> 00:29:05.076]  David Rockefeller and other satanic pieces of garbage who thought they'd set up their world government.
[00:29:05.076 --> 00:29:10.798]  Believe they pulled the drain on America a long time ago.
[00:29:10.798 --> 00:29:17.180]  But if we understand that they've orchestrated this by design, and if there is a mass awakening,
[00:29:19.187 --> 00:29:24.808]  It can be their unraveling, their destruction, and them going down the drain.
[00:29:24.808 --> 00:29:29.849]  The Bible tells us that many times when the enemy digs a pit for us, they themselves fall into it.
[00:29:29.849 --> 00:29:35.170]  But God is the master of the universe, but gives us free will on this planet as a test.
[00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:41.651]  It is up to us to decide whether we're going down the drain, or whether the globalists are going down the drain.
[00:29:41.651 --> 00:29:45.012]  I cannot express to listeners and viewers of this broadcast how important you are.
[00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:48.293]  Everything hinges on you.
[00:29:48.293 --> 00:29:49.233]  Everything.
[00:29:49.233 --> 00:29:53.176]  Peacefully become the Paul Revere you know you've always been.
[00:29:53.176 --> 00:29:59.341]  God bless and good luck.
[00:29:59.341 --> 00:30:01.963]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:25.046 --> 00:30:36.440]  Welcome back, I just showed you that cringy video of CEOs, the CEO of Chick-fil-A and I got a lot of other CEOs here as well, but when I look at the comments that he made...
[00:30:37.652 --> 00:30:40.054]  The pandering that he was doing.
[00:30:40.054 --> 00:30:46.721]  Things that he said, uh, white Christians should have a sense of shame, should have an apologetic heart.
[00:30:46.721 --> 00:30:49.103]  Our silence is so huge at this time.
[00:30:49.103 --> 00:30:54.508]  Silence is violence, said the CEO of Chick-fil-A.
[00:30:54.508 --> 00:30:55.749]  We cannot be silent.
[00:30:55.749 --> 00:30:58.412]  Somebody's got to fight!
[00:30:58.412 --> 00:31:02.396]  And then, you know, when he came to, he's doing, making these remarks there in Atlanta.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:14.586]  You know, after you had the man who was shot and killed by the police officer, they burned that Wendy's down.
[00:31:14.586 --> 00:31:19.768]  Now, how is Wendy's responsible for that in any way, shape, or form?
[00:31:19.768 --> 00:31:22.970]  He said, we shouldn't just be criticizing people burning down that restaurant last night.
[00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:25.952]  We've got to understand their sense of frustration.
[00:31:25.952 --> 00:31:29.693]  The incredible amounts of frustration and pain.
[00:31:29.693 --> 00:31:30.514]  White people are just
[00:31:31.963 --> 00:31:33.083]  Oblivious to all that?
[00:31:33.083 --> 00:31:34.584]  Oh really?
[00:31:34.584 --> 00:31:34.824]  Really?
[00:31:34.824 --> 00:31:39.065]  I think you're missing the point here.
[00:31:39.065 --> 00:31:44.566]  You know, I got a lot of people got angry with me because quite frankly I didn't think that that shooting was justified.
[00:31:44.566 --> 00:31:46.486]  Yeah, the guy was a scumbag.
[00:31:46.486 --> 00:31:50.127]  Yeah, the guy had been in jail and he shouldn't have been let out of jail.
[00:31:50.127 --> 00:31:53.688]  Quite frankly, that's really where the first problem came.
[00:31:53.688 --> 00:31:55.769]  He shouldn't have been let out of jail.
[00:31:55.769 --> 00:31:57.189]  He'd been abusive to his family.
[00:31:58.448 --> 00:32:09.410]  He was drunk or under the influence of something in the drive-thru, and the cops tried to talk to him for 20 minutes or so.
[00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:14.971]  And then he ran for it, and he grabbed the taser of the cop and ran for it.
[00:32:14.971 --> 00:32:23.993]  And he's running over his shoulder, he shoots the taser, and then at that point, the cop pulls out his gun and shoots him in the back as he's running away.
[00:32:23.993 --> 00:32:25.653]  And that's the problem I have with what the cop did.
[00:32:27.008 --> 00:32:30.330]  So you don't have to say that one of these guys is a saint.
[00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:31.450]  Neither one of them are saints.
[00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:32.391]  They both made mistakes.
[00:32:32.391 --> 00:32:39.935]  The problem is, is that if somebody is running away from you, you don't shoot them in the back!
[00:32:39.935 --> 00:32:45.518]  You know, one of the reasons why, and it was kind of funny the other day, it was noticed that O.J.
[00:32:45.518 --> 00:32:47.339]  Simpson, many of you may remember,
[00:32:48.191 --> 00:32:51.494]  In the 90s, that long, prolonged chase of O.J.
[00:32:51.494 --> 00:32:53.136]  Simpson through L.A.
[00:32:53.136 --> 00:32:54.517]  Why did that happen for so long?
[00:32:54.517 --> 00:32:55.538]  It went on for hours!
[00:32:55.538 --> 00:32:57.961]  There were tens of millions of people that watched that live.
[00:32:57.961 --> 00:33:00.063]  The whole country was watching it live.
[00:33:00.063 --> 00:33:01.784]  Why did that happen?
[00:33:01.784 --> 00:33:06.229]  Well, it was a slow-speed chase that was happening.
[00:33:06.229 --> 00:33:12.095]  And the reason it was a slow-speed chase was because the police had changed their rules.
[00:33:13.544 --> 00:33:21.507]  See, a lot of innocent people had gotten killed when the police decided that they were going to, you know, do whatever it takes to stop a car that's running from them.
[00:33:21.507 --> 00:33:24.428]  And wisely, they decided, all right, we'll just play it cool.
[00:33:24.428 --> 00:33:28.110]  We'll follow him for hours until he runs out of gas or whatever.
[00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:31.751]  And we've got helicopters, we've got radios, we've got him in sight.
[00:33:31.751 --> 00:33:32.792]  He isn't going to get out of our sight.
[00:33:32.792 --> 00:33:36.033]  He isn't going to get away.
[00:33:36.033 --> 00:33:38.454]  But, you know, they didn't resort to deadly force.
[00:33:39.989 --> 00:33:46.092]  The problem is that that guy was a low-life loser, multiple-time loser.
[00:33:46.092 --> 00:33:48.413]  But still, you don't shoot somebody like that in the back.
[00:33:48.413 --> 00:34:01.398]  That's why on my program I showed an example of a guy coming in with his face covered and he started a hold-up in a store.
[00:34:01.398 --> 00:34:03.179]  And the guy that was in the store had concealed carry.
[00:34:03.179 --> 00:34:05.240]  He pulled it out and it began a gunfight.
[00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:09.251]  And the guy was shot in his hip, the bad guy.
[00:34:09.251 --> 00:34:12.072]  But they were shooting at each other over the count.
[00:34:12.072 --> 00:34:16.553]  And the guy crawled away, and the gun was right next to him.
[00:34:16.553 --> 00:34:26.476]  And the good guy in the store, who was defending himself and his employee, and defending their lives, said, get away from the gun or I'll shoot.
[00:34:26.476 --> 00:34:32.018]  And he had him, you know, the guy didn't have his gun, he had the gun pointed at him, and he crawled away and then ran away.
[00:34:33.285 --> 00:34:38.809]  And the guy called 9-11, told the other neighbors there, be careful there's a dangerous guy out here.
[00:34:38.809 --> 00:34:50.618]  You see, if he'd been a cop, because of the rules of immunity, he would have been entitled, or at least thought that he was entitled, to go ahead and empty his gun into that guy when he was no longer a threat.
[00:34:50.618 --> 00:34:54.762]  Now that guy was still facing him and his gun was within reach and he didn't reach for it.
[00:34:54.762 --> 00:35:01.327]  But if you shoot as a citizen, you need to understand this, if as a citizen you shoot somebody in the back that is running away from you,
[00:35:02.461 --> 00:35:06.082]  You're going to be facing charges, and rightfully so, in my opinion.
[00:35:06.082 --> 00:35:16.205]  Somebody breaks into your home, takes your stuff, starts running out the door, even if they shoved you, if they're still not fighting you, if your life is not at risk.
[00:35:16.205 --> 00:35:19.106]  Yeah, you have the right to defend yourself if they're coming at you.
[00:35:19.106 --> 00:35:20.627]  Absolutely you do.
[00:35:20.627 --> 00:35:23.388]  And I would suggest that you do.
[00:35:23.388 --> 00:35:27.729]  But if they're running away, you don't shoot them in the back.
[00:35:27.729 --> 00:35:30.110]  And we should not have different rules for different groups of people.
[00:35:31.516 --> 00:35:37.221]  I tweeted out the other day, you know we've got immunity for big pharmaceutical companies for vaccines.
[00:35:37.221 --> 00:35:40.424]  We've got immunity for cops who are doing this.
[00:35:40.424 --> 00:35:41.625]  How's that working out for us?
[00:35:41.625 --> 00:35:44.287]  Should we be giving immunity, legal immunity to people?
[00:35:44.287 --> 00:35:47.910]  I think it just corrupts these organizations when that happens.
[00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:58.119]  So, you need to understand that there's something different happening here, and that no matter who you think was right or wrong, it's not justified to go burn down somebody's business.
[00:36:01.223 --> 00:36:15.872]  And so when you see this entitled, privileged, white, rich, liberal, the CEO of Chick-fil-A talking about this, what he is suggesting to people is that they are entitled to get violent.
[00:36:15.872 --> 00:36:17.093]  They're entitled to loot.
[00:36:17.093 --> 00:36:20.135]  They're entitled to burn buildings.
[00:36:20.135 --> 00:36:21.315]  Because, you know, they're frustrated.
[00:36:21.315 --> 00:36:23.297]  So that's fine.
[00:36:23.297 --> 00:36:27.980]  Maybe he's just happy that they burned his competitor.
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:28.340]  I don't know.
[00:36:29.684 --> 00:36:37.194]  But when you look at this, I mean just, the story that broke earlier this week, the 92-year-old woman.
[00:36:37.194 --> 00:36:44.163]  The black guy, the young black guy walking past her just smacks her in the head, you know, because she's a filthy white person.
[00:36:44.163 --> 00:36:45.805]  She deserves it.
[00:36:45.805 --> 00:36:48.068]  You know, the slave owner there, right?
[00:36:49.983 --> 00:36:53.144]  And she's now afraid to walk in her own neighborhood.
[00:36:53.144 --> 00:36:55.045]  She has lived in New York for 50 years.
[00:36:55.045 --> 00:36:56.766]  She's never had anything like this.
[00:36:56.766 --> 00:36:58.546]  Why is this happening now?
[00:36:58.546 --> 00:37:05.469]  Because the racism that's being fermented by white liberals, like the Chick-fil-A CEO.
[00:37:05.469 --> 00:37:07.610]  She said, I thought a brick hit me or something.
[00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:08.670]  Hit me on the left side of my head.
[00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:11.451]  I went right down, hit my head against the hydrant.
[00:37:11.451 --> 00:37:12.992]  I thought she'd missed the hydrant, but she didn't.
[00:37:12.992 --> 00:37:14.612]  She said blood was coming out.
[00:37:14.612 --> 00:37:16.293]  Not spreading blood, but blood was dripping.
[00:37:17.574 --> 00:37:22.258]  You said her physical wounds are relatively minor and they've healed, but the mental toll has been much more severe.
[00:37:22.258 --> 00:37:24.699]  She's afraid to walk in her own neighborhood.
[00:37:24.699 --> 00:37:38.890]  In Houston, we had a guy who was in a grocery store, caught on surveillance footage, and he had several black guys jump in front of the line, and he said, hey, wait a minute, we got a line here.
[00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:45.275]  And because of that, when he walked out, they started attacking him and saying, black lives matter, black lives matter.
[00:37:46.752 --> 00:37:49.553]  This is what is being fermented by these people.
[00:37:49.553 --> 00:37:51.793]  Also happened in Ocean City, Maryland.
[00:37:51.793 --> 00:37:53.193]  Large brawl there.
[00:37:53.193 --> 00:37:54.274]  Even in Australia.
[00:37:54.274 --> 00:38:00.495]  They got a white girl that is on a bus, beaten by a group of black girls.
[00:38:00.495 --> 00:38:05.136]  This is being engendered by people who are saying, you are entitled to this.
[00:38:05.136 --> 00:38:07.196]  You have been wronged by these people.
[00:38:07.196 --> 00:38:09.737]  And they haven't been wronged by these people.
[00:38:09.737 --> 00:38:13.797]  These people are not guilty simply because they're white.
[00:38:13.797 --> 00:38:16.558]  But that's what this CEO is telling them.
[00:38:17.964 --> 00:38:36.653]  And remember, when we look at this guy, you know, somebody pushed back on this with me, and when I said, just another spoiled, rich, guilty, white liberal, somebody on Twitter said, well, it's called humility, something that Jesus liked you to have.
[00:38:36.653 --> 00:38:39.115]  I said, no, it's called virtue signaling.
[00:38:39.115 --> 00:38:42.016]  It's really a form of self-righteousness and pride.
[00:38:42.016 --> 00:38:45.298]  And in this context, he is fomenting racism.
[00:38:46.903 --> 00:38:49.284]  You know, Christ is colorblind.
[00:38:49.284 --> 00:38:51.345]  And He is right.
[00:38:51.345 --> 00:38:53.525]  He did make us all of one blood.
[00:38:53.525 --> 00:38:54.586]  You know, we're all descended.
[00:38:54.586 --> 00:38:56.246]  If you're a Christian, you believe the Bible.
[00:38:56.246 --> 00:38:57.247]  We're all descended from Adam.
[00:38:57.247 --> 00:38:59.308]  We're descended from Noah.
[00:38:59.308 --> 00:39:02.869]  Christ doesn't see black and white.
[00:39:02.869 --> 00:39:10.872]  But these people, by focusing on that, what they do is they throw out the work of Christ.
[00:39:10.872 --> 00:39:15.393]  You know, Christ reconciled us, not just to God, but to each other, through Himself.
[00:39:15.393 --> 00:39:16.534]  That's what Christians understand.
[00:39:17.625 --> 00:39:26.447]  And so I don't get these pastors, like this guy who's putting on this show, along with the CEO of Chick-fil-A.
[00:39:26.447 --> 00:39:30.087]  I don't understand where they're coming from, frankly.
[00:39:30.087 --> 00:39:34.808]  You know, is it not good enough for them that Christ has reconciled us?
[00:39:34.808 --> 00:39:40.989]  I've got more to say about this when we come back, and I'll tell you what these other CEOs are doing, and I'll tell you what Nancy Pelosi and Kamala Harris are doing.
[00:39:40.989 --> 00:39:41.629]  We'll be right back.
[00:39:41.629 --> 00:39:42.029]  Stay with us.
[00:39:56.341 --> 00:39:58.002]  It's finally here.

[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:54.289]  That's Survival Shield X2 Spray at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:40:55.595 --> 00:41:07.578]  We were told by the United Nations, we were told by the CDC and Fauci that two plus million Americans would die, that millions of Europeans would die if we did not do exactly as they said.
[00:41:07.578 --> 00:41:09.539]  And it turned out it was all frauds.
[00:41:09.539 --> 00:41:16.481]  The models, the testing, taking regular deaths and putting it in the COVID-19 column, all a complete criminal fraud.
[00:41:16.681 --> 00:41:18.443]  But none of them are getting sued.
[00:41:18.443 --> 00:41:20.144]  None of them are getting prosecuted.
[00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:22.366]  None of them are getting in trouble, except for Bill Gates.
[00:41:22.366 --> 00:41:28.471]  The FDA shut down his factories that are making fake COVID tests that show everyone is positive.
[00:41:28.471 --> 00:41:37.219]  And despite that, they're still testing record numbers of people, creating hysteria and saying the number's spiking and why it'll be 200,000 dead by the election.
[00:41:37.219 --> 00:41:39.180]  And it's all Trump's fault.
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:42.023]  And now, oh, China had 40 cases in one city.
[00:41:42.023 --> 00:41:43.444]  We've had a lockdown again.
[00:41:43.444 --> 00:41:44.265]  Everything's over.
[00:41:44.765 --> 00:41:48.615]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the new world order teaching us to be total prisoners.
[00:41:48.615 --> 00:41:52.645]  Either we expose the COVID hoax, or we're all permanently enslaved by it.
[00:41:52.645 --> 00:41:53.186]  Your choice.
[00:41:57.478 --> 00:42:01.139]  It's time to take a new, healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.

[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.622]  I just devoured your cousin at InfoWars Live.
[00:43:33.622 --> 00:43:34.322]  Protein Bar.

[00:43:51.177 --> 00:44:00.303]  Our original Mega Flash Specials have ended, but our new GE Specials have launched at InfoWareStore.com!
[00:44:00.303 --> 00:44:02.925]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:44:27.574 --> 00:44:37.001]  Alright, I'm going to finish with this.
[00:44:37.001 --> 00:44:39.704]  This got me so triggered.
[00:44:39.704 --> 00:44:41.645]  Yeah, it really did.
[00:44:41.645 --> 00:44:48.411]  Because it was such a... It's not just white liberals, but he is lecturing Christians.
[00:44:48.411 --> 00:44:50.973]  And again, Christ reconciled us.
[00:44:50.973 --> 00:44:52.194]  Not just to God, but to each other.
[00:44:52.194 --> 00:44:53.215]  He doesn't see black and white.
[00:44:53.956 --> 00:44:57.078]  He sees two different races that are racing either way from him or towards him.
[00:44:57.078 --> 00:44:58.838]  That's it.
[00:44:58.838 --> 00:44:59.519]  That's it.
[00:44:59.519 --> 00:45:13.266]  And the reason this is being done here is because of the third person on the stage, Pastor Louis Giglio, suggested that white privilege should be called a white blessing.
[00:45:13.266 --> 00:45:17.048]  Can you believe this?
[00:45:17.048 --> 00:45:19.629]  Days after suggesting to rapper Lecrae,
[00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:24.874]  That white privilege be renamed to white blessing because it triggers some white people.
[00:45:24.874 --> 00:45:28.917]  He's taking that back and saying, oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:45:28.917 --> 00:45:29.617]  I'm so sorry.
[00:45:29.617 --> 00:45:31.138]  I'm just so heartbroken about this.
[00:45:31.138 --> 00:45:34.181]  Yes, white privilege is real.
[00:45:34.181 --> 00:45:39.064]  And we need to change that to the phrase white blessing.
[00:45:39.064 --> 00:45:42.206]  And he says, I'm sorry about my horrible choice of words.
[00:45:42.206 --> 00:45:43.747]  It doesn't reflect my heart.
[00:45:43.747 --> 00:45:46.329]  What does reflect his heart?
[00:45:46.329 --> 00:45:47.770]  You know, there's another disease out there.
[00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:48.971]  It's called influenza.
[00:45:48.971 --> 00:45:49.591]  It's not COVID-19.
[00:45:52.085 --> 00:45:54.367]  Sorry, not influenza, affluenza.
[00:45:54.367 --> 00:45:56.028]  The other kind of influenza.
[00:45:56.028 --> 00:46:03.672]  Yeah, affluenza is people that are affected by a love of money.
[00:46:03.672 --> 00:46:16.660]  And it does affect a lot of big church pastors who are all out there trying to pander to people, who are trying to solve all the world's problems by themselves, trying to earn their way for things that have already been done for them.
[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.861]  You know, a pastor like this ought to understand
[00:46:20.267 --> 00:46:26.371]  That God's blessing is often found in adversity.
[00:46:26.371 --> 00:46:41.081]  If you've been a Christian for a while, and you've been through some rough times, you find that even though nobody likes it, some of the best times in my life have been my times of adversity.
[00:46:41.081 --> 00:46:44.023]  And I look back on them.
[00:46:44.023 --> 00:46:47.806]  And so when you look at it, what is going to be a better time as a Christian?
[00:46:49.352 --> 00:46:55.018]  Is it going to be the poverty or the privilege and the prosperity?
[00:46:55.018 --> 00:46:59.302]  And if we want to talk about Civil War history, we want to talk about the history of our country.
[00:46:59.302 --> 00:47:06.029]  You know, the South was one of the richest, was the richest area, by far and away.
[00:47:06.029 --> 00:47:13.136]  They had, before the Civil War, there had been five presidents out of Virginia.
[00:47:15.327 --> 00:47:25.133]  As a matter of fact, if you wanted to sound sophisticated before the Civil War, you would speak with a Southern accent, even if you didn't have one.
[00:47:25.133 --> 00:47:27.134]  After the Civil War, it changed.
[00:47:27.134 --> 00:47:36.000]  You had about five presidents that were out of Ohio, and then the Midwest accent became predominant.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.423]  But I think one of the best things that ever happened to the South, really, was losing the war.
[00:47:42.776 --> 00:47:45.577]  And losing their prosperity and their privilege.
[00:47:45.577 --> 00:47:46.837]  They became the Bible Belt.
[00:47:46.837 --> 00:47:48.838]  I don't think that was a coincidence.
[00:47:48.838 --> 00:48:01.721]  You know, before the war, do you think it was a coincidence that you had such a deep religious fervor with the slaves and their spirituals that they did?
[00:48:01.721 --> 00:48:10.463]  That is... I can imagine there were a lot of slaves who had a much richer relationship with Christ than their rich masters did.
[00:48:11.516 --> 00:48:13.657]  Not much of a stretch to imagine that.
[00:48:13.657 --> 00:48:20.898]  As a matter of fact, if you're a pastor, you might want to talk to people about the rich man and Lazarus, instead of all this social engineering stuff.
[00:48:20.898 --> 00:48:23.879]  I mean, getting pulled into that kind of nonsense.
[00:48:23.879 --> 00:48:24.779]  I mean, who do you want to be?
[00:48:24.779 --> 00:48:29.101]  Do you want to be the rich man, or do you want to be Lazarus?
[00:48:29.101 --> 00:48:30.721]  That's what the pastor should be focusing on.
[00:48:32.179 --> 00:48:38.244]  He should stop pushing this reparations stuff and payment.
[00:48:38.244 --> 00:48:41.968]  You're going to have the sins of your ancestors focused on you.
[00:48:41.968 --> 00:48:44.430]  Absolutely not!
[00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:46.071]  Absolutely not as a Christian.
[00:48:46.071 --> 00:48:57.982]  And then when you look at the Chick-fil-A CEO, as I pointed out in the tweet, this is a guy who just threw Christian organizations under the bus last year at the behest of LGBT groups.
[00:48:59.653 --> 00:49:04.875]  Who were hammering them on that.
[00:49:04.875 --> 00:49:10.118]  And so he threw under the bus, he threw the Salvation Army, he threw the Fellowship of Christian Athletes under the bus.
[00:49:10.118 --> 00:49:11.799]  We're not going to give them any more money.
[00:49:11.799 --> 00:49:14.840]  Because they believe in traditional marriage.
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:19.162]  And that's hateful to the LGBT groups.
[00:49:19.162 --> 00:49:24.464]  You know, I had, as I mentioned that, some person came back and said, because I mentioned that in the tweet,
[00:49:26.766 --> 00:49:31.069]  A person came back and said, hey David, since when has every LGBT person been of the left?
[00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:33.450]  Rather curious about your absurd logic.
[00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:36.112]  You know, you can be conservative and be LGBT.
[00:49:36.112 --> 00:49:42.656]  And I said, that's right, you can be black and conservative, but don't expect to get any love from the black advocacy groups.
[00:49:42.656 --> 00:49:46.078]  They're going to hate you and try to destroy your life.
[00:49:46.078 --> 00:49:49.100]  And the same thing is true if you're LGBT and conservative as well.
[00:49:50.589 --> 00:50:08.142]  Don't expect any respect or love or you're going to get nothing but bricks thrown at you from the LGBT advocacy groups because it's this kind of polarization and groupthink and political parties that is destroying this country.
[00:50:08.142 --> 00:50:16.407]  Oh, you've got to either be with the blacks and support everything, you've got to support them burning down Wendy's, or you're with the cops who shoot people in the back.
[00:50:16.407 --> 00:50:18.109]  I'm not with either one of those groups, thank you!
[00:50:19.488 --> 00:50:21.889]  I oppose both of them.
[00:50:21.889 --> 00:50:23.810]  I think we need to have real serious reform.
[00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:25.371]  And I've said this for a long time.
[00:50:25.371 --> 00:50:31.514]  I've said the block to reforming the police is by making it about racism.
[00:50:31.514 --> 00:50:35.675]  Because you understand, the federal government doesn't want reform of the police.
[00:50:35.675 --> 00:50:38.417]  The federal government wants to run the police.
[00:50:38.417 --> 00:50:44.419]  And these proposals that are coming out of the Trump administration are only going to further consolidate centralized control of the police.
[00:50:44.419 --> 00:50:46.560]  That's a very dangerous thing.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.661]  I do not support that.
[00:50:48.942 --> 00:51:03.086]  I do not support the federal government setting the rules, setting the training, rewarding people who do what they want, creating all kinds of reports about what happens to people based on their skin color and ethnic group and so forth.
[00:51:03.086 --> 00:51:13.309]  This is a recipe for even more conflict because what the government wants right now, what they are pushing us toward right now, is civil war.
[00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:17.310]  They've known that the timing is right, generationally.
[00:51:18.086 --> 00:51:21.047]  Got multiple people, I'll talk about this coming up.
[00:51:21.047 --> 00:51:25.228]  Multiple people have pointed out whether they're economists or whether they're historians.
[00:51:25.228 --> 00:51:28.670]  They said, you know, we're at a time right now where this stuff is going to break down.
[00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:33.371]  Some of them predicted it 10 years ago, some of them predicted it 30 years ago.
[00:51:33.371 --> 00:51:34.872]  And it's all happening.
[00:51:34.872 --> 00:51:40.514]  And you don't think that the UN and the federal government understands this cycle of history that we're in right now?
[00:51:40.514 --> 00:51:41.714]  You don't think they're exploiting that?
[00:51:43.049 --> 00:51:43.589]  Yes they are.
[00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:47.491]  34% of American voters think the Civil War is likely a second Civil War.
[00:51:47.491 --> 00:51:49.112]  Rasmussen Poll.
[00:51:49.112 --> 00:51:52.133]  Sometime in the next five years.
[00:51:52.133 --> 00:51:55.294]  And believe me, I'm one of those people.
[00:51:55.294 --> 00:52:00.757]  And it's been kind of interesting to watch this unfold.
[00:52:01.741 --> 00:52:03.902]  And so we have the corporate CEOs out there.
[00:52:03.902 --> 00:52:08.483]  You got Jeff Bezos saying, slavery ended a long time ago, but racism didn't.
[00:52:08.483 --> 00:52:11.644]  And so he's urging employees to cancel meetings on Juneteenth.
[00:52:11.644 --> 00:52:24.247]  Interestingly enough, Jeff Bezos, who's all about the money, told a few of these virtue signaling CEOs who are pushing Juneteenth that did not make it a paid holiday.
[00:52:24.247 --> 00:52:25.708]  He just said, well, you don't have to have a meeting.
[00:52:25.708 --> 00:52:26.688]  It's still going to work.
[00:52:28.342 --> 00:52:30.283]  Got to come there and got to work.
[00:52:30.283 --> 00:52:30.923]  But here's something.
[00:52:30.923 --> 00:52:33.244]  Nike made it a paid company holiday.
[00:52:33.244 --> 00:52:35.265]  Target made it a paid company holiday.
[00:52:35.265 --> 00:52:35.946]  Amazon again.
[00:52:35.946 --> 00:52:39.367]  Not a paid company holiday, just cancel some meetings.
[00:52:39.367 --> 00:52:40.948]  It'll look bad.
[00:52:40.948 --> 00:52:42.189]  Twitter and Square.
[00:52:42.189 --> 00:52:44.050]  Jack Dorsey owns both of those.
[00:52:44.050 --> 00:52:45.871]  Paid company holiday.
[00:52:45.871 --> 00:52:48.392]  You've got the same thing with Google.
[00:52:51.218 --> 00:52:52.159]  Same thing as Amazon.
[00:52:52.159 --> 00:52:53.780]  They're really greedy.
[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:55.101]  Silicon Valley people.
[00:52:55.101 --> 00:52:56.703]  Well, don't have any meetings.
[00:52:56.703 --> 00:52:59.025]  We're not going to pay you for this.
[00:52:59.025 --> 00:53:00.165]  JP Morgan.
[00:53:00.165 --> 00:53:03.568]  It's going to close its branches and count its money instead of doing it.
[00:53:03.568 --> 00:53:04.329]  Spotify.
[00:53:04.329 --> 00:53:05.450]  Paid company holiday.
[00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:07.091]  Then you got the car companies.
[00:53:07.091 --> 00:53:08.812]  GM.
[00:53:08.812 --> 00:53:11.815]  And I got this sent to me in the mail.
[00:53:11.815 --> 00:53:12.075]  Email.
[00:53:13.078 --> 00:53:18.381]  I'm not going to mention his name.
[00:53:18.381 --> 00:53:20.922]  He said you can mention my name because he was so upset about it.
[00:53:20.922 --> 00:53:26.205]  He works for Fiat Chrysler FCA, Fiat Chrysler America.
[00:53:26.205 --> 00:53:30.308]  He said, I work at one of the major three car plants in Kokomo, Indiana.
[00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:35.864]  We are seriously stopping production because of George Floyd.
[00:53:35.864 --> 00:53:41.328]  8 minutes, 46 seconds, and they're doing it at 8.46 a.m.
[00:53:41.328 --> 00:53:42.589]  and 8.46 p.m.
[00:53:42.589 --> 00:53:45.331]  and he sent me the memo.
[00:53:45.331 --> 00:53:49.714]  And that's in Indiana because of something that happened in Minneapolis.
[00:53:51.363 --> 00:53:57.168]  He says, what better way to start my Friday morning than to remind all the black people how much they really hate white people.
[00:53:57.168 --> 00:53:58.970]  And that's really what this is about.
[00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:01.632]  And you know, it's not just FCA.
[00:54:01.632 --> 00:54:09.079]  It's also General Motors is doing the same thing at exactly the same time, which makes me think this is something coming from the United Auto Workers.
[00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:14.044]  Because I don't know if Ford is doing that, Toyota, Honda, other places who have facilities here.
[00:54:14.890 --> 00:54:16.091]  We've got to take a break, folks.
[00:54:16.091 --> 00:54:19.014]  Take a look at the products we've got at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:54:19.014 --> 00:54:23.257]  I'll tell you what's coming up with Juneteenth in terms of the holiday when we come back.
[00:54:23.257 --> 00:54:24.458]  But take a look at the products we have.
[00:54:24.458 --> 00:54:31.004]  We've got 70% off of our 8-pack Power Stack, AM and PM supplements with that.
[00:54:31.004 --> 00:54:34.808]  70% off, we have Brain Force Plus, our number one bestseller.
[00:54:34.808 --> 00:54:36.809]  60% off, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:54:36.809 --> 00:54:38.991]  We really do appreciate your support.
[00:54:38.991 --> 00:54:39.532]  We'll be right back.
[00:54:46.904 --> 00:55:00.009]  David Rockefeller and other satanic pieces of garbage who thought they'd set up their world government, believe they pulled the drain on America a long time ago.
[00:55:00.009 --> 00:55:06.372]  But if we understand that they've orchestrated this by design, and if there's a mass awakening,
[00:55:08.402 --> 00:55:14.003]  It can be their unraveling, their destruction, and them going down the drain.
[00:55:14.003 --> 00:55:19.044]  The Bible tells us that many times when the enemy digs a pit for us, they themselves fall into it.
[00:55:19.044 --> 00:55:24.385]  But God is the master of the universe, but gives us free will on this planet as a test.
[00:55:24.385 --> 00:55:30.846]  It is up to us to decide whether we're going down the drain, or whether the globalists are going down the drain.
[00:55:30.846 --> 00:55:34.207]  I cannot express to listeners and viewers of this broadcast how important you are.
[00:55:35.663 --> 00:55:37.507]  Everything hinges on you.
[00:55:37.507 --> 00:55:38.449]  Everything.
[00:55:38.449 --> 00:55:42.397]  Peacefully become the Paul Revere you know you've always been.
[00:55:42.397 --> 00:55:44.402]  God bless and good luck.
[00:55:46.584 --> 00:55:54.889]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism and so populist movements are throwing the globalists out of their countries.
[00:55:54.889 --> 00:56:05.796]  That's why the New World Order is instituting race war and division and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying essential services.
[00:56:06.596 --> 00:56:15.018]  This is an attempt to have society collapse, and the globalists, as they've done in the third world, will come in and pick up the pieces.
[00:56:15.018 --> 00:56:21.619]  We must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU, openly saying, defund the police.
[00:56:21.619 --> 00:56:22.940]  The police have a lot of problems.
[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:24.300]  We all have a lot of problems.
[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:27.060]  But this is our government and our local constabulary.
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:29.141]  And believe me, once the globalists have overthrown this country,
[00:56:29.997 --> 00:56:34.018]  They're going to put in a real police state where you have no due process or freedom.
[00:56:34.018 --> 00:56:37.780]  The globalists believe communist China is the model of the world.
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:39.960]  And they are orchestrating this entire thing.
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:44.422]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed.
[00:56:44.422 --> 00:56:49.804]  Infowars.com!
[00:56:49.804 --> 00:56:52.465]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:01.653 --> 00:57:06.275]  We've got a story at Infowars.com.
[00:57:06.275 --> 00:57:14.378]  At least eight people were shot during a two-hour span in Minneapolis on Tuesday.
[00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:33.081]  A total of nine people were wounded in separate shootings around the city overnight.
[00:57:33.081 --> 00:57:38.303]  In one incident, two women were hit by a drive-by shooting along with a third victim who turned up at a local hospital.
[00:57:38.303 --> 00:57:43.485]  Minutes after the drive-by, two men dropped off at a hospital suffering from gunshot injuries.
[00:57:43.485 --> 00:57:48.647]  Subsequently, two more men with gunshot wounds arrived at an emergency room in the city.
[00:57:48.647 --> 00:57:51.428]  So how's that working out for you guys there?
[00:57:51.428 --> 00:57:55.969]  You know, when you look at the population of Minneapolis, 425,000 people in Minneapolis.
[00:57:55.969 --> 00:57:58.070]  I mean, this is looking like Chicago, isn't it?
[00:57:58.973 --> 00:58:01.074]  Except Chicago's got about three million.
[00:58:01.074 --> 00:58:06.596]  It's about six times the number of people, yet they're getting about the same number of shootings here.
[00:58:06.596 --> 00:58:08.497]  It's absolutely amazing!
[00:58:08.497 --> 00:58:15.180]  The violence comes amid a sharp rise in shootings in the 22 days since Floyd's death.
[00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:21.223]  66 people have been shot, about 45% of the total shooting victims for the year, according to the data from the police.
[00:58:21.223 --> 00:58:24.544]  The first week after Floyd's death saw a record 22 gunshot victims.
[00:58:26.428 --> 00:58:31.009]  Well, the following two weeks had 16 and 19 victims, respectively.
[00:58:31.009 --> 00:58:35.350]  All among the top five most violent weeks in the city since 2016.
[00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:42.432]  And so I guess the solution is CHAZ, right?
[00:58:42.432 --> 00:58:50.274]  You know, I think as we look at CHAZ, I think we ought to start calling it, they changed their name to CHAOT, not CHAOS.
[00:58:50.274 --> 00:58:52.155]  That's what it should be, to CHOP.
[00:58:53.619 --> 00:58:57.720]  But I think that we ought to call it Chazistan.
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:00.581]  I mean, just go back and we can keep calling them Chaz.
[00:59:00.581 --> 00:59:02.142]  But call them Chazistan.
[00:59:02.142 --> 00:59:08.644]  And I think just like Pakistan is geographically separated, you know, it's split.
[00:59:08.644 --> 00:59:15.986]  As India left the British Empire, you had the Muslims want to have Pakistan instead of India.
[00:59:15.986 --> 00:59:20.027]  And so they wound up with East and West Pakistan on opposite sides of India.
[00:59:21.124 --> 00:59:26.968]  And so I think what we ought to have here in America, we ought to just call these independent areas, kind of like Pakistan.
[00:59:26.968 --> 00:59:33.573]  We can have, they're both part of Chazistan, and we can have East and West Chazistan.
[00:59:33.573 --> 00:59:41.559]  So you can have Minneapolis be East Chazistan, and Seattle can become West Chazistan.
[00:59:41.559 --> 00:59:45.202]  And quite frankly, I think we ought to just let these people be an example.
[00:59:46.193 --> 00:59:48.875]  To everyone as to what is happening.
[00:59:48.875 --> 00:59:56.402]  I don't want to see... When you look at what is happening in Seattle, for example.
[00:59:56.402 --> 01:00:04.448]  To punish some people because they didn't practice COVID rules and etiquette.
[01:00:04.448 --> 01:00:07.531]  The etiquette rules for COVID-19 coming out of the CDC.
[01:00:07.531 --> 01:00:09.993]  To punish them, they had their power and water turned off.
[01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:11.971]  By the city.
[01:00:11.971 --> 01:00:17.113]  But, you know, nobody has turned off the power and water for Kazakhstan.
[01:00:17.113 --> 01:00:21.936]  They were talking in their documents, they had documents that they put out, and said, you know, what do we do if they cut off our water?
[01:00:21.936 --> 01:00:27.459]  Well, let's see, could we drill through this?
[01:00:27.459 --> 01:00:29.180]  Anybody got something we can get through this concrete?
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:33.943]  Well, then what about the power lines or the sewer lines or any of that kind of stuff?
[01:00:33.943 --> 01:00:36.384]  Might have been the wrong kind of water.
[01:00:36.384 --> 01:00:39.546]  Oh, I know, we can fly in water bottles.
[01:00:40.854 --> 01:00:45.275]  With drones, if they surround us.
[01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:46.915]  Yeah, that's why they call it Evian.
[01:00:46.915 --> 01:00:49.376]  It's naive spelled backwards.
[01:00:49.376 --> 01:01:00.598]  You know, it's absolutely ridiculous and everybody is laughing about them and I'm glad that President Trump hasn't done anything to force the issue because the governor of Washington and the mayor is all for that.
[01:01:00.598 --> 01:01:03.998]  I mean, if they wanted to do something about that, they could.
[01:01:03.998 --> 01:01:07.419]  And so, let these people wallow in their own filth.
[01:01:08.493 --> 01:01:17.938]  And they can be an object lesson to everybody, and they should be, as to what is happening with this model society that they want to give everybody.
[01:01:17.938 --> 01:01:25.663]  They've become a running joke, and I think that they ought to be allowed to continue to illustrate the folly of what is happening.
[01:01:25.663 --> 01:01:29.885]  But we're going to talk, coming up in this hour, about America held hostage.
[01:01:29.885 --> 01:01:32.487]  It's now over three months.
[01:01:32.487 --> 01:01:37.250]  And we don't want to become Venezuela as a country.
[01:01:38.226 --> 01:01:44.522]  And unfortunately, these COVID lockdown etiquette rules are increasing.
[01:01:45.569 --> 01:01:47.710]  And we are at risk of doing that.
[01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:52.233]  So I've got a couple more things to say about the Juneteenth movement that is happening right now.
[01:01:52.233 --> 01:01:54.615]  We're going to talk about the SCOTUS.
[01:01:54.615 --> 01:01:56.716]  The globalists want us domesticated.
[01:01:56.716 --> 01:02:02.820]  They want us inside our homes, watching our televisions and being controlled by our, quote, smartphones.
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:04.040]  Everybody knows this.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.221]  It's for admitted gold.
[01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:14.387]  We've had whistleblowers from Facebook, Twitter, and Google go public and say, at the highest levels, their job is to make you neurotic, destroy your mind, and take over your life.
[01:02:14.867 --> 01:02:17.189]  And now the COVID hysteria is all about that.
[01:02:17.189 --> 01:02:28.180]  I recently had a woman in the street while I was with my youngest daughter and my daughter walked close to her and she said, get away six feet and gave her a super ugly look.
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:30.783]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is mental illness.
[01:02:30.783 --> 01:02:34.166]  My daughter walking four feet from some old woman is not a crime.
[01:02:34.166 --> 01:02:38.250]  The old woman's mental illness is the crime if we give in to it.
[01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:42.072]  This is total and complete mind control.
[01:02:42.072 --> 01:02:45.234]  We must expose the COVID hoax now.
[01:02:45.234 --> 01:02:47.335]  They're going to continue to clamp down using this.
[01:02:47.335 --> 01:02:47.956]  It's a U.N.
[01:02:47.956 --> 01:02:49.116]  Bill Gates plan.
[01:02:49.116 --> 01:02:52.678]  They've been proven to be criminal liars, and they must be defeated.
[01:02:52.678 --> 01:03:01.183]  They must be exposed.
[01:03:01.183 --> 01:03:02.404]  You found it.
[01:03:02.404 --> 01:03:04.425]  The tip of the spear.
[01:03:04.425 --> 01:03:06.687]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:03:08.599 --> 01:03:11.300]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[01:03:29.386 --> 01:03:36.496]  And Alex Jones is going to be coming up in the segment after this, after this segment in the break.
[01:03:36.496 --> 01:03:40.842]  But real quickly, I was talking about the CEOs and how they're pushing this.
[01:03:41.878 --> 01:03:43.339]  And some of this is pretty fake.
[01:03:43.339 --> 01:03:50.223]  I mean, you know, Jeff Bezos is out there talking about racism, feeling everybody's pain on this.
[01:03:50.223 --> 01:03:58.408]  But of course, he says, as other CEOs are making it a, say, paid holiday, he is saying, don't hold any meetings.
[01:03:58.408 --> 01:03:59.629]  Come to work.
[01:03:59.629 --> 01:04:00.589]  Just don't hold any meetings.
[01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:01.470]  That's going to look bad.
[01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:02.791]  Uber is doing kind of the same thing.
[01:04:03.866 --> 01:04:07.030]  Uber says they're going to make Juneteenth a paid day off.
[01:04:07.030 --> 01:04:08.892]  The thing is, they don't have that many employees.
[01:04:08.892 --> 01:04:11.234]  Remember, their drivers are not officially employees.
[01:04:11.234 --> 01:04:13.817]  They're not going to be getting paid.
[01:04:13.817 --> 01:04:15.419]  They're contract workers.
[01:04:15.419 --> 01:04:18.542]  They're not taxi drivers, so don't regulate them like taxi drivers.
[01:04:18.542 --> 01:04:19.904]  You know, they get special treatment.
[01:04:19.904 --> 01:04:20.785]  They're contract workers.
[01:04:22.104 --> 01:04:23.605]  Special treatment, all right.
[01:04:23.605 --> 01:04:24.926]  And then the political side of this.
[01:04:24.926 --> 01:04:29.949]  Kamala Harris is introducing a bill to make Juneteenth a national holiday.
[01:04:29.949 --> 01:04:31.670]  And of course, you know, why not?
[01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:34.852]  I mean, we should never have to work again.
[01:04:34.852 --> 01:04:42.137]  We have Trump and the Republicans are talking about giving people $4,000 for a family to take a vacation.
[01:04:42.137 --> 01:04:43.958]  I mean, you know, we just keep printing money.
[01:04:43.958 --> 01:04:45.419]  Who needs to have a job?
[01:04:45.419 --> 01:04:46.500]  We don't need any of that stuff.
[01:04:47.712 --> 01:04:53.033]  The magic money machine in the sky, just raining cash down on us.
[01:04:53.033 --> 01:04:54.133]  You can get paid up to 50%.
[01:04:54.133 --> 01:05:00.875]  I don't think I've ever taken a vacation that was $8,000, but you can take up to $8,000 and get 50% of it paid.
[01:05:00.875 --> 01:05:04.655]  $4,000 right there.
[01:05:04.655 --> 01:05:10.897]  You not only get paid for not working, universal basic income, but you get paid for vacationing.
[01:05:10.897 --> 01:05:12.317]  What's not to like about this?
[01:05:12.317 --> 01:05:17.138]  I mean, let's just kick back and enjoy this while the ride lasts.
[01:05:18.595 --> 01:05:19.957]  Yeah.
[01:05:19.957 --> 01:05:25.743]  Pelosi is ordering the removal of portraits of four former House Speakers from the U.S.
[01:05:25.743 --> 01:05:29.127]  Capitol for June 10th.
[01:05:29.127 --> 01:05:39.578]  Late Thursday afternoon, the gold-framed portraits of four former Speakers of the House of Representatives who shared ties to the Confederacy were removed from the walls of the U.S.
[01:05:39.578 --> 01:05:39.939]  Capitol.
[01:05:40.959 --> 01:05:56.010]  I guess, I don't know, she doesn't want any uncomfortable memories about the fact that Joe Biden voted to restore the citizenship of both Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederacy.
[01:05:56.010 --> 01:06:05.677]  Now, they are both dead, and they're both Democrats, so they will both be voting in this coming election as well.
[01:06:05.677 --> 01:06:10.121]  I wonder who Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis will be voting for in this coming election.
[01:06:11.698 --> 01:06:14.379]  with their restored citizenship.
[01:06:14.379 --> 01:06:25.582]  And of course, as we see the insanity of this, you know, even coming after people who were abolitionists, like Matthias Baldwin.
[01:06:25.582 --> 01:06:27.603]  He made money.
[01:06:27.603 --> 01:06:29.664]  He didn't make money with slavery.
[01:06:29.664 --> 01:06:31.304]  He made money by making machines.
[01:06:31.304 --> 01:06:33.365]  He hired black people, not as slaves.
[01:06:33.365 --> 01:06:37.986]  He was the first person in the area to hire black people as employees.
[01:06:37.986 --> 01:06:40.687]  He set up schools and paid for them out of his own fortune.
[01:06:42.209 --> 01:06:48.854]  building locomotives and they put up a statue to him.
[01:06:48.854 --> 01:06:50.716]  He did that, by the way, because he was a Christian.
[01:06:50.716 --> 01:06:55.199]  He made a lot of money, then he became a Christian, then he started helping black people and trying to abolish slavery.
[01:06:55.199 --> 01:06:56.560]  Funny how that works.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:00.943]  Kind of worked that way with William Wilberforce in Britain as well.
[01:07:00.943 --> 01:07:02.224]  But no, no, no.
[01:07:02.224 --> 01:07:05.227]  We've got to destroy all these people.
[01:07:05.227 --> 01:07:06.788]  And that's what they're doing with him.
[01:07:06.788 --> 01:07:09.230]  Now, Tim Scott, a black senator,
[01:07:10.077 --> 01:07:13.218]  from South Carolina said the U.S.
[01:07:13.218 --> 01:07:14.839]  is not a racist country.
[01:07:14.839 --> 01:07:20.961]  He said some people enjoy talking about systemic racism and they want to define everything from a racist perspective.
[01:07:20.961 --> 01:07:28.444]  It is a false binary choice to have to back either black Americans or law enforcement.
[01:07:28.444 --> 01:07:30.145]  That's exactly what I was saying.
[01:07:30.145 --> 01:07:31.005]  He's exactly right.
[01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:35.207]  If we really want to change things, that's what we have to do.
[01:07:35.207 --> 01:07:38.628]  But the hatred is so engendered now.
[01:07:40.094 --> 01:07:51.600]  That not only are they attacking white people just because they're white, but the visceral hatred that is being pushed by all these institutions now.
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:56.542]  Because it's not just the Democrats, it's not just the big company corporations.
[01:07:56.542 --> 01:08:02.425]  I mean, you know, popular mechanics telling people how to destroy monuments chemically.
[01:08:04.276 --> 01:08:11.381]  I had a picture sent to me by my wife of a monument that was burning because of the chemicals that they put on it.
[01:08:11.381 --> 01:08:13.202]  I mean, these people are just destroying everything.
[01:08:13.202 --> 01:08:24.509]  And they're even going through cemeteries and digging up the remains of Revolutionary and Civil War figures, even digging up the remains of toddlers in the ground.
[01:08:24.509 --> 01:08:27.951]  This is the insane hatred
[01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:37.775]  That people like Nancy Pelosi and these big corporate CEOs, these rich, spoiled elites who want to destroy our country.
[01:08:37.775 --> 01:08:39.496]  Yeah, they've got their money and they're going to get out.
[01:08:39.496 --> 01:08:41.337]  They're going to get out to their bug-out area.
[01:08:41.337 --> 01:08:50.021]  They're going to watch this place burn down and say, well, yeah, it should have happened just like Chick-fil-A's CEO said that about Wendy's.
[01:08:50.021 --> 01:08:53.003]  Oh, yeah, I can understand them burning it down.
[01:08:53.003 --> 01:08:54.524]  They want the entire country to burn down.
[01:08:56.601 --> 01:09:00.123]  So yeah, we got to make sure that doesn't happen.
[01:09:00.123 --> 01:09:04.286]  I was going to talk about sports, but I do want to get to the Supreme Court.
[01:09:04.286 --> 01:09:08.909]  I've only got about four minutes here before we go to break.
[01:09:08.909 --> 01:09:21.597]  When we look at what happened with this process with the Supreme Court, and I have talked about this ever since President Trump proposed changing DACA.
[01:09:21.597 --> 01:09:22.318]  He was sued.
[01:09:23.407 --> 01:09:30.731]  And then you had Jeff Sessions and then Barr and the Department of Justice defend this in the courts.
[01:09:30.731 --> 01:09:35.514]  I said, you don't have to defend this.
[01:09:35.514 --> 01:09:41.937]  This is an executive order from the previous president and that's exactly what Clarence Thomas is saying.
[01:09:41.937 --> 01:09:48.401]  He says, how can you make this into something that we decide whether or not this is going to end?
[01:09:48.401 --> 01:09:49.562]  Well, it is all political.
[01:09:50.305 --> 01:09:54.568]  When you look at the language that's being used in the headlines to talk about this.
[01:09:54.568 --> 01:09:56.009]  AP.
[01:09:56.009 --> 01:10:03.694]  Court rejects Trump's bid, his bid, to end young immigrants protections.
[01:10:03.694 --> 01:10:04.595]  Now this is the AP.
[01:10:04.595 --> 01:10:07.937]  The AP are the people who give us their style sheets.
[01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:11.780]  The AP style sheet says you cannot refer to somebody as being pro-life.
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:13.662]  That is forbidden.
[01:10:13.662 --> 01:10:16.864]  You don't talk about somebody being pro-life.
[01:10:16.864 --> 01:10:19.305]  You call them pro-abortion rights.
[01:10:20.609 --> 01:10:23.051]  And you don't say that somebody is anti-abortion.
[01:10:23.051 --> 01:10:26.653]  They are pro-abortion rights, right?
[01:10:26.653 --> 01:10:32.278]  I'm sorry, a pro-life person is an anti-abortionist, right?
[01:10:32.278 --> 01:10:34.299]  And that's what you refer to them as.
[01:10:34.299 --> 01:10:38.482]  And if they are pro-abortion, you say that they are pro-abortion rights.
[01:10:38.482 --> 01:10:39.683]  You don't call them an abortionist.
[01:10:39.683 --> 01:10:43.786]  When you talk about immigration, like they're talking about here, don't use the terms aliens.
[01:10:43.786 --> 01:10:45.527]  Don't use the term illegal.
[01:10:45.527 --> 01:10:47.669]  So certainly don't use illegal alien, right?
[01:10:50.134 --> 01:10:52.376]  You don't call them an illegal immigrant.
[01:10:52.376 --> 01:10:53.897]  You don't even call them undocumented.
[01:10:53.897 --> 01:10:57.461]  The new style sheets from AP say don't use the term undocumented.
[01:10:57.461 --> 01:11:00.103]  You call them migrants.
[01:11:00.103 --> 01:11:03.166]  And you call these people dreamers, even though there was never a DREAM Act.
[01:11:03.166 --> 01:11:13.075]  And in this article from the AP, they show a picture of Ivana Castillo holding a banner to show her support for dreamer Miriam from California.
[01:11:14.168 --> 01:11:17.210]  And they said DACA recipients are celebrating in front of the U.S.
[01:11:17.210 --> 01:11:18.290]  Supreme Court and so forth.
[01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:20.071]  That's the way they put this.
[01:11:20.071 --> 01:11:23.333]  Miriam's home is here.
[01:11:23.333 --> 01:11:30.096]  Well, as Robert says, we do not decide whether DACA or its rescission are sound policies.
[01:11:30.096 --> 01:11:37.960]  We address only whether the agency complied with the procedural requirement that it provide a reasonable explanation.
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.542]  So you got to explain why you want to do this.
[01:11:42.503 --> 01:11:43.744]  No you don't.
[01:11:43.744 --> 01:11:45.446]  It was an executive order.
[01:11:45.446 --> 01:11:54.034]  It was an executive order from Janet Napolitano, head of Homeland Security in the Obama administration.
[01:11:54.034 --> 01:11:57.578]  She didn't give any reason for that.
[01:11:57.578 --> 01:12:05.105]  And as one headline puts it, Judge Roberts decides that Obama is still president.
[01:12:05.105 --> 01:12:06.827]  One of the biggest problems facing this country
[01:12:07.935 --> 01:12:09.956]  Is the fact that we no longer have the 10th Amendment.
[01:12:09.956 --> 01:12:11.638]  We no longer have division of power.
[01:12:11.638 --> 01:12:16.781]  We don't divide power between the central government and the states and the people.
[01:12:16.781 --> 01:12:21.704]  The founders are very concerned that we're going to have a consolidation of power.
[01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:24.266]  And that was the last thing that they wanted.
[01:12:24.266 --> 01:12:29.330]  Because they knew that that kind of consolidation would destroy our freedom and liberty.
[01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:30.470]  It would breed corruption.
[01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:31.151]  And what have we seen?
[01:12:32.537 --> 01:12:33.398]  And it got even worse.
[01:12:33.398 --> 01:12:41.966]  Not only did they divide power between the federal government, the states, and the people with the Tenth Amendment, the Ninth and Tenth Amendment, but they also divided it within the federal government.
[01:12:41.966 --> 01:12:50.695]  And now you have Congress and the President pretending that the Supreme Court is supreme, that we have a pyramid structure, that they are at the top, these unelected officials.
[01:12:51.769 --> 01:12:52.710]  We'll talk more about that.
[01:12:52.710 --> 01:13:00.257]  United Nations is publicly depopulating Africa and many other third world sectors of the world.
[01:13:00.257 --> 01:13:06.844]  Bill and Melinda Gates that control the UNWHO openly say they want to depopulate brown people.
[01:13:06.844 --> 01:13:15.572]  It is absurdist that Apple and Google and Nike have slave factories in China, the worst on the planet, and then elect your white people.
[01:13:15.652 --> 01:13:18.513]  This is a totally sickening, disgusting joke.
[01:13:34.338 --> 01:13:39.682]  But at the heart of them is a eugenics-based depopulation operation.
[01:13:39.682 --> 01:13:46.508]  Why aren't Black Lives Matter at Cold Springs Harbor in New York, where they run the whole operation trying to topple statues?
[01:13:46.508 --> 01:13:48.470]  Why aren't they at the United Nations?
[01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:52.533]  Because they're controlled by the UN and being directed by their masters.
[01:13:52.972 --> 01:13:56.994]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System.
[01:13:56.994 --> 01:13:58.575]  The first of its kind.
[01:13:58.575 --> 01:14:03.538]  Pure, nascent, atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray bottle.
[01:14:03.538 --> 01:14:06.560]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:09.662]  Introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[01:14:09.662 --> 01:14:12.763]  The great part about the X2 Spray is it's great on the go.
[01:14:12.763 --> 01:14:15.245]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house.
[01:14:15.805 --> 01:14:26.330]  You know, great at work, but this is great for the car, it's great to keep with you, and again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:28.011]  We're really excited about it.
[01:14:28.011 --> 01:14:30.012]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[01:14:30.012 --> 01:14:41.497]  It was a listener's idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new, and in some ways, even better way.
[01:14:41.957 --> 01:14:55.928]  Get your Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine Spray now at 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com and experience the power of aerosolized X2 Nascent Iodine for yourself!
[01:14:55.928 --> 01:14:58.571]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:21.691]  Senator Josh Hawley along with Senator Cotton and others have introduced legislation to strip Big Tech of Section 230 immunity.
[01:15:21.691 --> 01:15:26.697]  Now this is cut and dry because Google, Facebook, Twitter, all of them
[01:15:26.977 --> 01:15:34.602]  have been busy using Section 230 to give themselves complete immunity from third-party content on their platforms.
[01:15:34.602 --> 01:15:39.725]  But Facebook particularly, but also Google, Apple, they all do it.
[01:15:39.725 --> 01:15:52.814]  They have been going in and telling people that have an app with them or have a website on their platform, you name it, that if any one of the comments says anything that the ADL doesn't approve of,
[01:15:53.354 --> 01:16:00.657]  That's actually the arbiter, the judge, jury, the executioner, the gods up on Mount Olympus, that then you will be deplatformed.
[01:16:00.657 --> 01:16:08.659]  If you go back to last year when we were, quote, banned again, Zuckerberg said, Jones has people saying bad things in his comment sections.
[01:16:08.659 --> 01:16:14.021]  Now, obviously that begs the question, somebody could go in there and stage that, and it turns out a lot of it is staged.
[01:16:14.021 --> 01:16:18.143]  A lot of internal documents came out of Facebook that indeed that's going on, but regardless,
[01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:21.160]  That's third-party content.
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.049]  That's people saying things in the comments section.
[01:16:23.837 --> 01:16:36.826]  And in fact, in the first Facebook report that came out and leaked, they were talking about, well, it's actually a very low percentage of the comments are racist, so we need to get a higher percentage out, and then we'll ban it.
[01:16:36.826 --> 01:16:46.593]  Well, once that was put in all the newspapers, the left then went, registered as right-wingers and started spewing leftist, you know, Jussie Smollett false flags, and got us removed.
[01:16:46.593 --> 01:16:49.035]  So, this whole thing is completely rigged.
[01:16:49.035 --> 01:16:49.896]  The council that
[01:16:50.871 --> 01:16:54.954]  Zuckerberg set up earlier this year that will decide what to censor and what not to censor.
[01:16:54.954 --> 01:16:56.956]  It's all a complete joke.
[01:16:56.956 --> 01:17:05.983]  And the fact that Zero Hedge and the Federalists have broken the damn on this, where again they're being banned for the comments that were made.
[01:17:06.844 --> 01:17:07.044]  Is it?
[01:17:27.119 --> 01:17:27.219]  Yes.
[01:17:50.405 --> 01:17:50.686]  I think?
[01:18:06.164 --> 01:18:11.886]  In your private files, in your accounts, in your cloud, in your private messages, monitoring you.
[01:18:11.886 --> 01:18:13.646]  This has all been publicly said.
[01:18:13.646 --> 01:18:15.847]  Microsoft is also involved in NewsGuard.
[01:18:15.847 --> 01:18:17.227]  This is next level.
[01:18:17.227 --> 01:18:20.228]  Okay, so the real big issue here is, dive into the censorship.
[01:18:20.228 --> 01:18:24.989]  What is totally cut and dry, even beyond that, because the censorship is absolutely clear as well.
[01:18:25.829 --> 01:18:30.872]  Is the lying to Congress about the censorship, but more importantly, lying to Congress about the surveillance.
[01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:33.693]  Remember, Google and others have gotten up and said they don't track users.
[01:18:33.693 --> 01:18:35.414]  This is like saying water isn't wet.
[01:18:35.414 --> 01:18:52.384]  So the fact that they have let third-party groups in that surveillance spy, and then they certify that you're evil in this special Soviet-style secret court, and then that's used to then go out and have you banned and restricted by the big tech platforms.
[01:18:53.163 --> 01:19:00.145]  So what's happening is the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center and others, they admit they want people arrested that don't follow their orders.
[01:19:00.145 --> 01:19:06.007]  They want Mark Zuckerberg, as Sacha Baron Cohen said earlier this year, arrested unless he fully submits to them.
[01:19:06.007 --> 01:19:09.469]  This is beyond mind control, beyond occult.
[01:19:09.469 --> 01:19:12.870]  This is Hitlerian, Stalinistic, Maoistic.
[01:19:13.710 --> 01:19:15.272]  Uh, control.
[01:19:15.272 --> 01:19:20.076]  And now it's really coming out in everybody's face that you're being watched in live time.
[01:19:20.076 --> 01:19:21.977]  AI is controlling what you do.
[01:19:21.977 --> 01:19:25.961]  It was always built from the beginning to abuse you and to control you.
[01:19:25.961 --> 01:19:27.602]  One ring to bind them all.
[01:19:27.602 --> 01:19:29.384]  One ring to enslave them.
[01:19:29.384 --> 01:19:30.905]  One ring to bring in their new world order.
[01:19:30.905 --> 01:19:33.707]  And that's what this AI system has been built to do from the beginning.
[01:19:33.707 --> 01:19:37.851]  It's total global, absolute hegemonic domination.
[01:19:37.851 --> 01:19:40.814]  So everybody asked when I first got banned two and a half years ago,
[01:19:41.474 --> 01:19:41.534]  I'm
[01:20:04.585 --> 01:20:13.795]  Working with these third party fake watchdog political groups, DNC funded, literally coming in together and trying to shut down their competition.
[01:20:13.795 --> 01:20:16.158]  And now they're expanding out to the general public.
[01:20:16.158 --> 01:20:18.841]  Oh, you said some things we didn't like on Facebook or Twitter.
[01:20:18.841 --> 01:20:20.863]  Now your credit rating's gone down.
[01:20:20.863 --> 01:20:22.364]  Now you can't have a bank account.
[01:20:22.364 --> 01:20:23.265]  Now you can't have
[01:20:23.886 --> 01:20:31.691]  This digital wallet, this is the social credit score on steroids being implemented and deployed right now.
[01:20:31.691 --> 01:20:33.171]  So I'm on quasi-vacation.
[01:20:33.171 --> 01:20:35.493]  A lot of people have been calling me saying, why haven't you responded to this yet?
[01:20:36.713 --> 01:20:40.055]  It's kind of like a caller saying, hey, we talked about the Federal Reserve being private.
[01:20:40.055 --> 01:20:40.955]  I've been talking about it 26 years.
[01:20:40.955 --> 01:20:43.716]  Or, hey, you want to talk about the censorship.
[01:20:43.716 --> 01:20:45.497]  We're on top of it.
[01:20:45.497 --> 01:20:46.898]  We're at the center of it.
[01:20:46.898 --> 01:20:53.520]  And quite frankly, I've moved on to trying to stop the nanoparticles they're adding to vaccines that are confirmed that reprogram your brain.
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:58.983]  I mean, we're so much further down the line now, folks, that if people haven't woken up to this by now, there's no helping you.
[01:20:59.443 --> 01:21:00.884]  Big tech is your enemy.
[01:21:00.884 --> 01:21:02.345]  Big corporations are your enemy.
[01:21:02.345 --> 01:21:03.166]  They're cold-blooded.
[01:21:03.166 --> 01:21:04.647]  They're on a power trip.
[01:21:04.647 --> 01:21:07.249]  They have a plan for the future, and we're not in it.
[01:21:07.249 --> 01:21:08.350]  It's very, very simple.
[01:21:08.350 --> 01:21:10.892]  We are seen as meat on the table of the globalists.
[01:21:10.892 --> 01:21:13.353]  We are seen as lower than animals.
[01:21:13.353 --> 01:21:18.657]  What they're teaching us is that animals are superior to us so that they can control us and take our rights.
[01:21:18.657 --> 01:21:19.878]  Do you understand?
[01:21:19.878 --> 01:21:23.601]  They're creating humanoid animal-human clones for 30 years.
[01:21:23.601 --> 01:21:24.682]  They're mad scientists.
[01:21:24.682 --> 01:21:27.564]  We're all in grave, grave, grave danger.
[01:21:29.275 --> 01:21:32.966]  All right, that was Alex Jones, and he's in Washington, D.C.
[01:21:32.966 --> 01:21:35.794]  They're picking him up as the new press secretary.
[01:21:37.034 --> 01:21:37.594]  Not really.
[01:21:37.594 --> 01:21:48.816]  That's a joke, an old joke coming from Bablin B. Back when Sean Spicer resigned, they put out a parody, Trump Picks Alex Jones as New Press Secretary.
[01:21:48.816 --> 01:21:53.097]  Well, that would be an improvement, actually, because we do support free speech here.
[01:21:53.097 --> 01:21:59.178]  We're not afraid to tell you what we think and to argue why we think that's true.
[01:21:59.178 --> 01:22:01.639]  And if you don't agree with us, that's fine.
[01:22:01.639 --> 01:22:03.239]  That used to be what free speech was about.
[01:22:04.181 --> 01:22:08.225]  Not making sure that you manage it for whatever phony agenda.
[01:22:08.225 --> 01:22:09.887]  You want to say, oh, we don't want to hurt somebody's feelings.
[01:22:09.887 --> 01:22:10.888]  No, no, no.
[01:22:10.888 --> 01:22:12.670]  It was never about that.
[01:22:12.670 --> 01:22:16.254]  And if that's going to be the standard, you will never have free speech.
[01:22:16.254 --> 01:22:20.198]  It's the freedom to offend, quite frankly, is what free speech is based on.
[01:22:20.198 --> 01:22:26.045]  The Federalist, one of the two organizations that Alex was just talking about that was targeted by Google for extinction.
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:34.583]  As they pointed out, it's a former Google engineer that says Google's claims of no partisan bias are hogwash.
[01:22:34.583 --> 01:22:36.604]  And of course, we have seen that many, many times.
[01:22:36.604 --> 01:22:40.226]  We've had Project Veritas have whistleblowers.
[01:22:40.226 --> 01:22:44.308]  They've also talked to people who work for Google.
[01:22:44.308 --> 01:22:51.692]  And as they point out, it's kind of surreal to find out from NBC, and not from Google, that Google is going to demonetize you.
[01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:58.251]  Had CNN devote its time to trying to get rid of InfoWars.
[01:22:58.251 --> 01:23:03.392]  So now NBC has taken on that task for both Zero Hedge and for The Federalist.
[01:23:03.392 --> 01:23:09.754]  They came back and walked that back after people started complaining about that.
[01:23:09.754 --> 01:23:13.935]  But of course this is something that is rolling out everywhere.
[01:23:13.935 --> 01:23:15.575]  And there's two things about this.
[01:23:15.575 --> 01:23:22.237]  You know, I keep seeing a lot of these, now that it's getting into more mainstream conservative publications like The Federalist,
[01:23:23.513 --> 01:23:31.799]  People are starting to push back against this somewhat, even though the libertarian and conservative think tanks have said, oh, it's just private.
[01:23:31.799 --> 01:23:32.800]  They can do whatever they want.
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:39.864]  As I said before, if you're going to give immunity to big pharmaceutical companies to push out vaccines, no matter how much they harm people, you do it for the police.
[01:23:39.864 --> 01:23:44.087]  You do it for the big tech companies with Section 230.
[01:23:44.087 --> 01:23:44.868]  What do you wind up with?
[01:23:44.868 --> 01:23:46.929]  All right, we're going to be right back.
[01:23:46.929 --> 01:23:47.310]  Stay with us.
[01:23:50.779 --> 01:23:55.200]  Hello, Rob Dew here with InfoWarsStore.com, and I've got some good news and some bad news.

[01:24:23.811 --> 01:24:25.112]  Mmm.
[01:24:25.112 --> 01:24:27.114]  I just devoured your cousin in 4 or 5.
[01:24:27.114 --> 01:24:28.475]  Protein Bar.
[01:24:39.901 --> 01:24:42.982]  And on top of that, get an unprecedented 70% off our a.m.
[01:24:42.982 --> 01:24:43.382]  p.m.

[01:24:45.322 --> 01:24:51.224]  Our original Mega Flash specials have ended, but our new GE specials have launched at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:24:51.224 --> 01:24:52.244]  It's finally here.
[01:24:52.244 --> 01:24:57.085]  Introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true atomic iodine.
[01:24:57.085 --> 01:25:00.386]  Listers have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray
[01:25:00.706 --> 01:25:00.786]  Yeah.
[01:25:15.623 --> 01:25:21.324]  I use the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power of trunascent iodine working for my body.
[01:25:21.324 --> 01:25:22.904]  I can personally feel the difference.
[01:25:22.904 --> 01:25:31.026]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[01:25:31.026 --> 01:25:35.867]  Iodine may also support your body in healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[01:25:35.867 --> 01:25:40.668]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of trunascent iodine today.
[01:25:40.868 --> 01:25:48.317]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 Spray for 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com before we sell out of our new limited first shipment.
[01:25:48.317 --> 01:25:51.902]  That's InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:25:51.902 --> 01:26:00.092]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[01:26:01.383 --> 01:26:06.105]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[01:26:06.105 --> 01:26:08.466]  Super Male Vitality!
[01:26:08.466 --> 01:26:17.311]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[01:26:17.311 --> 01:26:28.196]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[01:26:28.496 --> 01:26:29.157]  Yes.
[01:26:29.157 --> 01:26:34.060]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:40.984]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[01:26:40.984 --> 01:26:42.045]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:26:42.045 --> 01:26:43.906]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[01:26:43.906 --> 01:26:46.708]  Never been a better time than right now.
[01:26:46.708 --> 01:26:53.832]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:26:53.832 --> 01:26:56.494]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:18.373 --> 01:27:20.095]  But I want to say thank you to you.
[01:27:20.095 --> 01:27:22.737]  I haven't had an orthodox career.
[01:27:22.737 --> 01:27:27.021]  And I wanted more than anything to have your respect.
[01:27:27.021 --> 01:27:29.043]  The first time I didn't feel it.
[01:27:29.043 --> 01:27:30.864]  But this time I feel it.
[01:27:30.864 --> 01:27:34.087]  And I can't deny the fact that you like me!
[01:27:34.087 --> 01:27:35.488]  Right now!
[01:27:35.488 --> 01:27:35.989]  You like me!
[01:27:42.705 --> 01:27:46.808]  She really felt it the second time she got the Oscar, that you like me, you really like me.
[01:27:46.808 --> 01:27:52.072]  Well, you know, President Trump has now been rejected twice this week by the Supreme Court.
[01:27:52.072 --> 01:27:54.213]  And he said, they don't like me.
[01:27:54.213 --> 01:27:56.735]  They really don't like me.
[01:27:56.735 --> 01:27:57.896]  Two times in one week.
[01:27:57.896 --> 01:27:59.797]  First time, it didn't really hit with him.
[01:27:59.797 --> 01:28:03.680]  But this time, when they say, well, you're not president.
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:05.141]  Obama is president.
[01:28:05.141 --> 01:28:07.603]  His executive orders are what we're going to go by.
[01:28:07.603 --> 01:28:09.424]  He comes back, they really don't like me.
[01:28:10.916 --> 01:28:19.880]  And he retweeted Clarence Thomas, who said the decision is, quote, an effort to avoid a politically controversial but legally correct decision.
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:23.662]  Look, this isn't about President Trump.
[01:28:23.662 --> 01:28:27.884]  What the Supreme Court doesn't like is division of power, separation of powers.
[01:28:27.884 --> 01:28:32.967]  What the Supreme Court doesn't like is the Bill of Rights, especially the 9th and 10th Amendment.
[01:28:34.742 --> 01:28:39.863]  They want to be the sole arbiters of everything that happens in this country.
[01:28:39.863 --> 01:28:42.264]  And, of course, it's always going to happen like that.
[01:28:42.264 --> 01:29:02.248]  When you have careerist bureaucrats, like Roberts, after what Gorsuch did this last week, reading into the 1964 Civil Rights Act, reading in LGBT anti-discrimination rules for transgenders and so forth,
[01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:10.543]  I said, can we finally get rid of this idea that the way to fix this country is through Washington?
[01:29:10.543 --> 01:29:13.004]  Washington is the problem, it's not the solution.
[01:29:13.004 --> 01:29:14.405]  Remember Reagan saying that?
[01:29:14.405 --> 01:29:16.426]  He was right about that.
[01:29:16.426 --> 01:29:19.667]  And the biggest problem in Washington is the Supreme Court.
[01:29:19.667 --> 01:29:27.991]  Or maybe it's the rest of the government in Washington and in the various states that bow down to the pronouncements of the Supreme Court.
[01:29:29.406 --> 01:29:31.968]  The Constitution is not a self-enforcing document.
[01:29:31.968 --> 01:29:35.090]  You have to stand up for your rights.
[01:29:35.090 --> 01:29:46.379]  But when I talked about Gorsuch going off the rails of the Constitution, you know, what doesn't have anything to do with what the text actually says, we don't care about that.
[01:29:46.379 --> 01:29:56.566]  You know, we were told that Gorsuch was going to be in the tradition of Scalia and so forth, that he was going to be an originalist, a textualist, and so forth.
[01:29:56.566 --> 01:29:58.768]  No, no, no, they'll just read into it whatever they want.
[01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:09.085]  And I said, I hope we can get over this naive idea that has now been disproven, just with Roe v. Wade for example.
[01:30:09.085 --> 01:30:24.435]  The idea, regardless of what you think about this, the idea that the Supreme Court would presume to say when life begins and so forth, or that they would presume that they had the authority to define marriage regardless of what their definition is.
[01:30:26.705 --> 01:30:29.748]  Or that they would talk about DACA or Obamacare.
[01:30:29.748 --> 01:30:33.231]  I mean, you've got Judge Roberts writing both sides of the Obamacare decision.
[01:30:33.231 --> 01:30:36.094]  I mean, you know, who's blackmailing this guy?
[01:30:36.094 --> 01:30:37.995]  That was absolutely amazing.
[01:30:37.995 --> 01:30:40.878]  Or what they've done with the drug wars.
[01:30:40.878 --> 01:30:49.786]  Regardless of what you think about DACA, you ought to be outraged by their logic here.
[01:30:49.786 --> 01:30:51.628]  Because this is nothing but judicial tyranny.
[01:30:52.677 --> 01:31:01.564]  It's not simply judicial supremacy, but it is the tyranny that always follows when you have consolidated, completely consolidated your power.
[01:31:01.564 --> 01:31:11.192]  And so I said, I hope that conservatives can get over this naive idea that by electing a Republican president, we're going to get good Supreme Court justices
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:13.821]  And it never works.
[01:31:13.821 --> 01:31:25.265]  It works for the Democrats, because it's pretty easy to find Democrats who are going to be statists when you pick from a pool of career bureaucrats.
[01:31:25.265 --> 01:31:34.649]  But when you pick, as a Republican President, when you have to pick from a pool of career bureaucrats, they typically go South.
[01:31:34.649 --> 01:31:40.012]  Now Clarence Thomas is an exception, but he really is the exception.
[01:31:40.871 --> 01:31:43.153]  Most of them are just dyed in the wool status.
[01:31:43.153 --> 01:31:46.395]  And again, Clarence Thomas, the thing that Biden was furious about.
[01:31:46.395 --> 01:31:50.158]  Biden led the opposition to Clarence Thomas.
[01:31:50.158 --> 01:31:55.261]  And Biden was furious about the fact that Clarence Thomas had written about natural rights.
[01:31:55.261 --> 01:32:00.185]  Clarence Thomas understands the Declaration of Independence.
[01:32:00.185 --> 01:32:04.448]  He agrees with the principle that we have fundamental human rights.
[01:32:05.728 --> 01:32:11.652]  That transcend and are there before the government hands them out to us as privileges.
[01:32:11.652 --> 01:32:13.353]  And Biden was furious about that.
[01:32:13.353 --> 01:32:21.179]  The left still hasn't forgiven Biden because he didn't come after Clarence Thomas Moore for the, he said, she said, accusations of Anita Hill.
[01:32:21.179 --> 01:32:23.921]  But of course those are phony as well.
[01:32:23.921 --> 01:32:34.749]  All of these pseudo-feminists, including Anita Hill, within a couple of years, were attacking the victims of Bill Clinton, calling them bimbos.
[01:32:36.676 --> 01:32:38.817]  Saying they deserved it.
[01:32:38.817 --> 01:32:48.363]  I mean, what he was accused of, credibly accused of, with Juanita Broderick and other people, violent sexual assault and rape.
[01:32:48.363 --> 01:32:51.545]  There were no credible statements made by Anita Hill.
[01:32:51.545 --> 01:32:54.487]  Nobody witnessed anything untoward.
[01:32:54.487 --> 01:32:56.668]  And what she accused Clarence Thomas of was nothing.
[01:32:56.668 --> 01:33:04.213]  But what Biden was concerned about was the idea that he would support, have the audacity to support natural rights.
[01:33:05.373 --> 01:33:10.395]  Nevertheless, President Trump is saying we need more justices or we will lose our Second Amendment and everything else.
[01:33:10.395 --> 01:33:12.416]  Vote Trump 2020!
[01:33:12.416 --> 01:33:14.978]  No, that isn't going to do it.
[01:33:14.978 --> 01:33:20.480]  Let me tell you what is going to do it.
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:28.164]  A lot has been spoken about President Trump and comparisons that he's made to Andrew Jackson.
[01:33:30.257 --> 01:33:31.318]  From the very beginning.
[01:33:31.318 --> 01:33:37.701]  He put a portrait of Andrew Jackson in the Oval Office and so forth, and so a lot of people criticized him for that.
[01:33:37.701 --> 01:33:42.684]  Trump is the first president to visit Andrew Jackson's grave since Ronald Reagan.
[01:33:42.684 --> 01:33:46.606]  Trump called pulling Andrew Jackson from the $20 bill pure political correctness.
[01:33:46.606 --> 01:33:48.367]  He was right about all that stuff, quite frankly.
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:34:02.245]  Nevertheless, you know, when you go back and you look at the populist background of Andrew Jackson and so forth, but let me tell you, I know Andrew Jackson and President Trump is no Andrew Jackson.
[01:34:02.245 --> 01:34:16.590]  Because even though Andrew Jackson forced the Trail of Tears, and I absolutely disagree with what he did, but he had the authority to do it.
[01:34:16.590 --> 01:34:16.950]  When he
[01:34:18.663 --> 01:34:21.084]  Pushed through what is known as the Trail of Tears.
[01:34:21.084 --> 01:34:26.685]  It pushed the Cherokee Indians out west, forced them to relocate to Oklahoma.
[01:34:26.685 --> 01:34:32.667]  It's estimated between 2 and 6 million Cherokee people died during the forced relocation.
[01:34:32.667 --> 01:34:35.728]  It was a horrible, horrible thing.
[01:34:35.728 --> 01:34:39.849]  Now, the Supreme Court had said a year earlier, well you can do that.
[01:34:39.849 --> 01:34:42.670]  And then they changed their mind and said you can't.
[01:34:44.284 --> 01:34:47.126]  Now, Andrew Jackson understood that there's a separation of power.
[01:34:47.126 --> 01:34:48.767]  They didn't have any ability to do that.
[01:34:48.767 --> 01:34:51.288]  He said, well, they've issued their opinion.
[01:34:51.288 --> 01:34:54.210]  Let's see them enforce it.
[01:34:54.210 --> 01:35:00.894]  And he was absolutely right about the fact that he had the authority to do that, even though his policy was absolutely wrong.
[01:35:00.894 --> 01:35:13.682]  And that's why I say, regardless of what you think about DACA, or about marriage, or what you think about abortion, you want to pay attention to the fact that we are becoming a dictatorship of politically appointed judges.
[01:35:15.933 --> 01:35:17.934]  And what they're doing to this country.
[01:35:17.934 --> 01:35:20.156]  We don't want to have a system like that.
[01:35:20.156 --> 01:35:22.998]  You don't want to have a system like that if you want to have any liberty.
[01:35:22.998 --> 01:35:27.701]  So, above and beyond the issue, take a look at what these people did.
[01:35:27.701 --> 01:35:29.403]  And how the press is cheering this.
[01:35:29.403 --> 01:35:30.624]  Oh, it was Trump's bid.
[01:35:30.624 --> 01:35:34.146]  Oh, they blocked Trump from doing this.
[01:35:34.146 --> 01:35:37.268]  And again, Roberts is saying, well, we don't like the way that you did this.
[01:35:37.268 --> 01:35:41.992]  And he joined the liberals, except that he joined the liberals completely a long time ago.
[01:35:43.226 --> 01:36:00.331]  Yeah, he does not believe anything that... Yeah, he was appointed by George W. Bush, a Republican, and one of the reasons that we're supposed to vote for George W. Bush, remember they told everybody, oh, you've got to vote for him because he's going to put in people in the Supreme Court and Judge Roberts, oh, he's great.
[01:36:00.331 --> 01:36:01.291]  Made him Chief Justice.
[01:36:01.291 --> 01:36:03.932]  He's going to be there for a long time, they said.
[01:36:03.932 --> 01:36:04.592]  5-4 majority.
[01:36:04.592 --> 01:36:12.094]  He joined Ginsburg, Kagan, Breyer, Sotomayor, saying that the President cannot get rid
[01:36:13.274 --> 01:36:17.277]  Of the executive order of Barack Obama.
[01:36:17.277 --> 01:36:22.261]  In dissent, Clarence Justice said, the court is making a huge mistake.
[01:36:22.261 --> 01:36:29.046]  He said, you're doing this... President Trump did it the same way the Obama administration did it.
[01:36:29.046 --> 01:36:30.067]  Unilaterally.
[01:36:30.067 --> 01:36:31.368]  And through a memorandum.
[01:36:31.368 --> 01:36:32.489]  It's an executive order.
[01:36:32.489 --> 01:36:38.153]  So what they're saying is that this administration cannot repeal the executive order of the previous one.
[01:36:38.153 --> 01:36:40.755]  Or, as another person said, they think that Obama is still president.
[01:36:40.755 --> 01:36:41.456]  We'll be right back.
[01:36:41.456 --> 01:36:41.816]  Stay with us.
[01:36:51.118 --> 01:36:51.559]  We're good to go.
[01:37:09.659 --> 01:37:16.283]  To the Democrat Party, Black Lives Matter, All White People Are Evil, Mind Control, Brainwashing Events.
[01:37:16.283 --> 01:37:20.206]  This is the attempted murder of common sense and logic.
[01:37:20.206 --> 01:37:29.853]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to be more politically active than you ever have because we are going into hardcore United Nations controlled bondage.
[01:37:29.853 --> 01:37:39.339]  Major police departments like Los Angeles and Albuquerque, New Mexico are announcing they're going under UN control and turning their, quote, police into community activist organizers.
[01:37:39.719 --> 01:37:41.220]  This is just the beginning.
[01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:44.282]  Everything's gonna accelerate now from this point out.
[01:37:44.282 --> 01:37:45.503]  So, it's here.
[01:37:45.503 --> 01:37:46.204]  No more games.
[01:37:46.204 --> 01:37:50.987]  The New World Order has arrived.
[01:37:50.987 --> 01:37:58.372]  David Rockefeller and other satanic pieces of garbage who thought they'd set up their world government.
[01:37:58.372 --> 01:38:04.096]  Believe they pulled the drain on America a long time ago.
[01:38:04.096 --> 01:38:07.859]  But if we understand that they've orchestrated this by design,
[01:38:09.090 --> 01:38:18.095]  And if there's a mass awakening, it can be their unraveling, their destruction, and them going down the drain.
[01:38:18.095 --> 01:38:23.139]  The Bible tells us that many times when the enemy digs a pit for us, they themselves fall into it.
[01:38:23.139 --> 01:38:28.462]  But God is the master of the universe, but gives us free will on this planet as a test.
[01:38:28.462 --> 01:38:34.946]  It is up to us to decide whether we're going down the drain, or whether the globalists are going down the drain.
[01:38:34.946 --> 01:38:38.308]  I cannot express to listeners and viewers of this broadcast how important you are.
[01:38:39.742 --> 01:38:41.585]  Everything hinges on you.
[01:38:41.585 --> 01:38:42.526]  Everything.
[01:38:42.526 --> 01:38:43.567]  Peacefully.
[01:38:43.567 --> 01:38:46.451]  Become the Paul Revere you know you've always been.
[01:38:46.451 --> 01:38:46.911]  God bless.
[01:38:50.990 --> 01:38:53.430]  I was talking to my Patriots supplier, Great Suppliers.
[01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:56.371]  You can now say four weeks on average for storable food.
[01:38:56.371 --> 01:38:57.431]  It's the highest quality.
[01:38:57.431 --> 01:38:58.871]  They've got it.
[01:38:58.871 --> 01:39:05.252]  Use this little rest we have, caught in the current, to come up to the surface, get some air, before you get sucked back down.
[01:39:05.252 --> 01:39:07.793]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[01:39:07.793 --> 01:39:11.134]  I have to now start going into defense posture.
[01:39:11.134 --> 01:39:15.974]  80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense, trying to fully, you know, stop the Globeless.
[01:39:15.974 --> 01:39:19.315]  And we've given them a good run, and I think down the road they'll be defeated, but
[01:39:20.558 --> 01:39:23.320]  We are going to still go down the hard road now.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:29.225]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still going to be bad in my view.
[01:39:29.225 --> 01:39:30.726]  You need to get high quality storable food.
[01:39:30.726 --> 01:39:31.927]  It's something you need.
[01:39:31.927 --> 01:39:42.955]  We have high quality ready to get out to you, and it supports the broadcast and 360 wins, so please take care of your storable foods needs at infowarstore.com and get your orders in now, so you get it, so you have it.
[01:39:42.955 --> 01:39:45.757]  It's in great containers, high quality, lasts 25 years.
[01:39:45.757 --> 01:39:49.760]  Get it while you can, because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:39:51.513 --> 01:39:53.295]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[01:39:53.295 --> 01:39:53.776]  You're on the air.
[01:39:53.776 --> 01:39:55.378]  Thanks for holding.
[01:39:55.378 --> 01:39:56.019]  I sure can, sir.
[01:39:56.019 --> 01:39:56.680]  Thank you.
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:00.184]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[01:40:07.333 --> 01:40:08.774]  I just want to plug in.
[01:40:08.774 --> 01:40:13.198]  I'm a truck driver and Tuberforce has changed the way I drive.
[01:40:13.198 --> 01:40:16.160]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us.
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:19.843]  We're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[01:40:19.843 --> 01:40:27.790]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank
[01:40:27.870 --> 01:40:28.611]  Thank you for that, man.
[01:40:28.611 --> 01:40:34.235]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[01:40:34.235 --> 01:40:36.537]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[01:40:36.537 --> 01:40:39.019]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues.
[01:40:39.019 --> 01:40:41.682]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[01:40:41.682 --> 01:40:45.705]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[01:40:45.705 --> 01:40:47.507]  And you're saying that it's made your life better?
[01:40:47.507 --> 01:40:48.247]  So that means a lot to me.
[01:40:48.247 --> 01:40:48.587]  Thank you.
[01:40:48.587 --> 01:40:53.331]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[01:40:53.331 --> 01:40:55.974]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:14.071 --> 01:41:25.639]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913 made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103.
[01:41:25.639 --> 01:41:28.521]  103 is forever when you're just a little kid.
[01:41:28.521 --> 01:41:41.410]  All right, before I leave this Supreme Court decision about DACA, and again, I've been talking about this a long time, I had Roy Moore on because Roy Moore was saying there is no such thing as a dreamer.
[01:41:43.203 --> 01:41:47.504]  You've had multiple attempts by the Democrats to pass the DREAM Act.
[01:41:47.504 --> 01:41:48.544]  They never did.
[01:41:48.544 --> 01:41:51.385]  Therefore, there are no DREAMers.
[01:41:51.385 --> 01:42:07.229]  You had Barack Obama's Homeland Security Director, or whatever she was called, Janet Napolitano, put out a memo saying, we're not going to enforce the law that we swore to uphold with the Constitution.
[01:42:07.229 --> 01:42:10.990]  We took our oath to the Constitution to swear to uphold the laws, but we're not going to do that.
[01:42:11.823 --> 01:42:17.167]  Deferred action on childhood arrivals.
[01:42:17.167 --> 01:42:35.739]  Again, you know, we had the legal fiction of anchor babies, and since we're talking about Juneteenth and so forth, you know, this is Juneteenth, June the 19th, 1865, you had a Union general go to Galveston, tell the slaves that they were free.
[01:42:35.739 --> 01:42:40.983]  And the press will say, even though Abraham Lincoln passed the Emancipation Proclamation two years earlier,
[01:42:42.110 --> 01:42:43.690]  Well, read the Emancipation Proclamation!
[01:42:43.690 --> 01:42:47.971]  It didn't free a single slave!
[01:42:47.971 --> 01:43:04.034]  It said that it freed the slaves under Union control, and specifically mentioned the states, and did not free any slaves that were under the control of the Confederacy.
[01:43:04.034 --> 01:43:08.455]  And he was doing that because he was holding that out as a negotiating tactic.
[01:43:09.451 --> 01:43:21.296]  To the Confederacy, saying, if you will come back into the Union and renounce your right to secession and self-government, we will let you keep slavery as an institution.
[01:43:21.296 --> 01:43:22.817]  And they said, no.
[01:43:22.817 --> 01:43:23.097]  No, no.
[01:43:23.097 --> 01:43:28.959]  We've stopped the slave trade, and we're going to get rid of the institution of slavery, but we're not going to give up our independence.
[01:43:28.959 --> 01:43:32.500]  And so the Emancipation Proclamation did not free anybody.
[01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:38.443]  When they announced it on Juneteenth, that is now being celebrated as the holiday, but what freed them was the 14th Amendment.
[01:43:39.753 --> 01:43:46.277]  But the 14th Amendment is being misused to support the idea of anchor babies.
[01:43:46.277 --> 01:44:04.249]  Now, the 14th Amendment says that, as it made slaves citizens, made it very clear, if you're born here in America under, subject to the jurisdiction of America, if your parents are subject to the jurisdiction, if you are an alien, a foreigner, an illegal immigrant,
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:06.240]  An illegal alien.
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:12.822]  You are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and so your kids are not American citizens if you read the 14th Amendment.
[01:44:12.822 --> 01:44:14.182]  But that's the fiction that they've created.
[01:44:14.182 --> 01:44:15.223]  The anchor baby.
[01:44:15.223 --> 01:44:18.123]  Obama took it another level.
[01:44:18.123 --> 01:44:27.926]  And what they said was, well, if you came here, you weren't born here, but you came here before a certain age, and that age is actually a lot older than you may think,
[01:44:30.356 --> 01:44:33.638]  He said, we're going to count you and treat you as if you're citizens.
[01:44:33.638 --> 01:44:41.161]  And then they tried to push through the same thing for parents who brought their kids here illegally.
[01:44:41.161 --> 01:44:43.462]  That was stopped.
[01:44:43.462 --> 01:44:50.526]  And yet, this executive order, Roberts says, cannot be changed.
[01:44:50.526 --> 01:44:55.208]  And this is nothing other than a political maneuver.
[01:44:55.208 --> 01:44:56.549]  As Clarence Thomas pointed out,
[01:44:57.725 --> 01:45:06.571]  He said, uh, the majority has decided to prolong DHS's initial overreach by providing a stopgap measure of its own.
[01:45:06.571 --> 01:45:17.098]  In doing so, the Supreme Court has given the green light for future political battles to be fought in this court rather than where they rightfully belong, the political branches.
[01:45:17.098 --> 01:45:26.925]  Such timidity forsakes the court's duty to apply the law according to neutral principles, and the ripple effect of the majority's error will be felt throughout our system of self-government.
[01:45:28.166 --> 01:45:46.431]  Clarence Thomas goes on to say, under the auspices of today's decision, administrations can bind their successors by unlawfully adopting significant legal changes through executive branch agency memoranda, even if the agency lacked authority to effectuate the changes.
[01:45:46.431 --> 01:45:52.453]  Understand, Janet Napolitano at the Department of Homeland Security, her duty was to enforce the law.
[01:45:52.453 --> 01:45:56.094]  She didn't have the authority to say, well, we're going to not enforce the law to a whole class of people.
[01:45:57.415 --> 01:45:58.755]  But they did it.
[01:45:58.755 --> 01:46:20.721]  And even though they ignored their legal responsibility and violated the law, he said the changes cannot be undone by the same agency and successive administration unless the successor provides sufficient policy justifications that satisfy this court.
[01:46:20.721 --> 01:46:23.142]  And we have seen this over and over again through the Trump administration.
[01:46:24.363 --> 01:46:30.164]  When President Trump put in the immigration restrictions on those seven countries.
[01:46:30.164 --> 01:46:32.665]  Five of them were Muslim, two of them were not.
[01:46:32.665 --> 01:46:34.586]  By the way, you can look this up.
[01:46:34.586 --> 01:46:36.466]  Look it up on Wikipedia.
[01:46:36.466 --> 01:46:43.268]  Venezuela is not Islamic, and neither is North Korea.
[01:46:43.268 --> 01:46:44.148]  That's a fact.
[01:46:44.148 --> 01:46:45.008]  Believe it.
[01:46:45.008 --> 01:46:46.069]  I know.
[01:46:46.069 --> 01:46:48.629]  I'm telling you this, but you can look it up for yourself.
[01:46:48.629 --> 01:46:51.170]  Venezuela and North Korea are not Muslim countries.
[01:46:52.435 --> 01:46:55.196]  It was not a Muslim ban, even though there were five countries there.
[01:46:55.196 --> 01:47:01.557]  These are countries, for the most part, that Obama had gone to war with and was still fighting, for the most part.
[01:47:01.557 --> 01:47:04.318]  There are 50 predominantly Muslim countries.
[01:47:04.318 --> 01:47:09.719]  So if you say that 10% of those you can't have immigration from, that is not a Muslim ban.
[01:47:09.719 --> 01:47:16.840]  And nevertheless, you had judges who said, well, it doesn't say that he doesn't like Muslims and he wants to ban Muslims, but I know how this guy feels.
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:19.381]  And I'm just certain that that's why he did it.
[01:47:20.393 --> 01:47:24.935]  It doesn't matter what you think his motivations were.
[01:47:24.935 --> 01:47:26.675]  The law is what matters.
[01:47:26.675 --> 01:47:31.257]  And yet, the law doesn't matter to Gorsuch.
[01:47:31.257 --> 01:47:35.118]  Because he read Transgender Lawsuit.
[01:47:35.118 --> 01:47:40.060]  And this is going to open up one legal fight after the other.
[01:47:40.954 --> 01:47:50.818]  As transgenders are going to be suing churches that don't hire them, schools that don't hire them, places where they don't have the kind of restrooms that they want, and so forth.
[01:47:50.818 --> 01:47:59.982]  Tom Cotton has said, if the Chief Justice Roberts believes his political judgment is so exquisite, I invite him to resign, travel to Iowa, and get elected.
[01:47:59.982 --> 01:48:01.903]  Ted Cruz said, judging is not a game.
[01:48:01.903 --> 01:48:03.123]  It's not supposed to be a game.
[01:48:03.123 --> 01:48:09.566]  But sadly, over the recent years, more and more, Chief Justice Roberts has been playing games with the court to achieve the policy outcomes that he desires.
[01:48:10.814 --> 01:48:12.956]  And then you had Marco Rubio.
[01:48:12.956 --> 01:48:14.957]  Little Marco.
[01:48:14.957 --> 01:48:19.941]  He said the Supreme Court increasingly appears to be legislating.
[01:48:19.941 --> 01:48:37.675]  Boy, I tell ya, that guy, you know, in the wake of Infowars being banned at the beginning of August, all the social media, they all moved within like a 12-hour period to ban all the different programs and social media, and Alex went to the, Alex Jones went to the
[01:48:38.700 --> 01:48:43.623]  Hearings that they were having in Washington, he saw Marco Rubio there in the hallway, and Marco Rubio pretended that he didn't know!
[01:48:43.623 --> 01:48:47.986]  Even though it was like the top news story globally.
[01:48:47.986 --> 01:48:52.790]  I even met somebody at a conference I was speaking at who was from Spain.
[01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:54.831]  Didn't speak English.
[01:48:54.831 --> 01:49:01.756]  But when I said, you know, I work for InfoWars for Alex Jones, he goes, oh, Alex Jones, si, si.
[01:49:01.756 --> 01:49:02.937]  But Marco Rubio didn't know.
[01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:05.470]  He didn't know.
[01:49:05.470 --> 01:49:07.170]  Then later he admitted he was lying.
[01:49:07.170 --> 01:49:16.192]  But he says, oh, he just now appears to realize that the Supreme Court appears to be legislating from the bench and he says it's concerning.
[01:49:16.192 --> 01:49:18.352]  But of course he's not going to do anything about it.
[01:49:18.352 --> 01:49:32.595]  And until we get a president who is going to act like Andrew Jackson and not just post his pictures and to say we have division of power and we're going to act on that, it's going to continue to get worse.
[01:49:34.346 --> 01:49:36.408]  And they're going to continue to do this about everything.
[01:49:36.408 --> 01:49:43.674]  They're going to just be, you know, nine little political dictators, continuing to go further and further status.
[01:49:43.674 --> 01:49:47.498]  And the Second Amendment, folks, is in danger.
[01:49:47.498 --> 01:49:52.102]  You cannot trust the Second Amendment to be respected or protected out of Washington.
[01:49:52.102 --> 01:49:59.689]  It's going to have to, we're going to have to focus on local grassroots, from the ground up, support of the Constitution to get it back.
[01:50:01.067 --> 01:50:01.847]  It's just that simple.
[01:50:01.847 --> 01:50:20.172]  Alright, as we look at what is happening to our liberties, I think this is expressed nowhere better than the pandemic, and the fact that as everything is winding down, and it really is, in spite of the propaganda that is coming out of the press, it really is winding down.
[01:50:20.172 --> 01:50:24.913]  But they want you to believe it's ramping up, a second wave, and now we've got to put in some new controls on you.
[01:50:26.274 --> 01:50:35.139]  And I'm going to tell you what this is really about, but as we look at the controls that are coming out, we've got California, statewide, saying you've got to wear a mask.
[01:50:35.139 --> 01:50:41.043]  Austin here, telling all customers and workers that you've got to wear masks inside of businesses.
[01:50:41.043 --> 01:50:49.968]  And Florida, in the Florida Keys, they're now going to require face masks until June of 2021.
[01:50:49.968 --> 01:50:51.649]  So for another full year, they've extended it.
[01:50:51.649 --> 01:50:54.550]  They know that it's not going to go away for another year.
[01:50:54.550 --> 01:50:55.591]  How do they know that?
[01:50:57.295 --> 01:51:00.377]  Well, because they're the ones who are making it up.
[01:51:00.377 --> 01:51:01.297]  That's how they know.
[01:51:01.297 --> 01:51:03.158]  They can't possibly know.
[01:51:03.158 --> 01:51:07.460]  They don't have a computer model that's going to tell them it's going to last another year.
[01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:10.922]  They don't have a crystal ball that's going to tell them.
[01:51:10.922 --> 01:51:14.484]  But they're going to tell you when it ends.
[01:51:14.484 --> 01:51:16.545]  And I'm going to tell you when we come back how they're using it.
[01:51:16.545 --> 01:51:23.969]  As Reuters says, putting aside concerns about individual rights and its political unpopularity, we have to do this.
[01:51:25.046 --> 01:51:26.427]  We don't care about your individual rights.
[01:51:26.427 --> 01:51:28.229]  We don't care how much you dislike this.
[01:51:28.229 --> 01:51:30.711]  We're going to do this anyway.
[01:51:30.711 --> 01:51:32.433]  Many states.
[01:51:32.433 --> 01:51:34.955]  And, uh, Austin.
[01:51:34.955 --> 01:51:35.516]  Of course.
[01:51:35.516 --> 01:51:36.116]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:36.116 --> 01:51:36.517]  Stay with us.
[01:51:39.690 --> 01:51:43.212]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key.
[01:51:43.212 --> 01:51:47.515]  Coffee and energy drinks provide a short boost, but the crash always follows.
[01:51:47.515 --> 01:51:52.098]  That's why we created a mixable energy formula to take on the go, TurboForce.
[01:51:52.098 --> 01:52:01.284]  TurboForce from Infowars Life utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used across the globe to provide focus, clarity, and a boost of energy when you need it.
[01:52:01.284 --> 01:52:05.747]  TurboForce is a force to be reckoned with for portable, affordable, and tasty energy.
[01:52:05.747 --> 01:52:09.410]  Try adding this to your daily routine and revolutionize your day today.
[01:52:10.170 --> 01:52:13.852]  It's time to take a new healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.
[01:52:13.852 --> 01:52:20.916]  The Alexapir Pro water filtration system is the same water filter that Alex and the Infowars crew use every day for the purest water possible.
[01:52:20.916 --> 01:52:24.898]  You can start cleaning the toxins from your water for clean, healthy, and delicious drinking water.

[01:52:31.861 --> 01:52:36.163]  This groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system is like no other.
[01:52:36.163 --> 01:52:39.045]  Make sure your water is up to your standards today with the Alexapir Pro.
[01:52:41.431 --> 01:52:43.092]  It's finally here.
[01:52:43.092 --> 01:52:47.196]  Introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray.

[01:53:18.318 --> 01:53:26.383]  Iodine is an essential mineral that helps support thyroid health, healthy metabolism, and healthy cognitive function.

[01:53:34.672 --> 01:53:44.383]  That's Survival Shield X2 Spray at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:53:44.383 --> 01:53:47.006]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:11.202 --> 01:54:24.691]  All right, as we see the ramping up the second wave of lockdown, Reuters is very excited about the fact that Democrat states like California, North Carolina, Democrat-controlled by Democrat governors, and a string of U.S.
[01:54:24.691 --> 01:54:30.835]  cities like Democrat-controlled Austin, are mandating mandatory mask use.
[01:54:31.957 --> 01:54:42.301]  They say it's to get a grip on spiraling coronavirus cases, and they don't want to worry about... We're going to put aside, as Reuters says, putting aside concerns about individual rights.
[01:54:42.301 --> 01:54:43.321]  That's right.
[01:54:43.321 --> 01:54:49.623]  Putting aside concerns about the Constitution, because, you know, we just had the Supreme Court justices say, we don't really care.
[01:54:49.623 --> 01:54:52.504]  We have things that are more important than what the law says.
[01:54:52.504 --> 01:54:54.965]  We don't care what the Constitution says about any of this stuff.
[01:54:54.965 --> 01:54:57.066]  And it's also unpopular, but they don't care about that either.
[01:54:57.870 --> 01:55:03.374]  A growing number are adopting CDC guidance that masks are essential now.
[01:55:03.374 --> 01:55:04.014]  They're essential now.
[01:55:04.014 --> 01:55:07.496]  They were telling us at the beginning of this that, oh, you don't have to have a mask.
[01:55:07.496 --> 01:55:12.420]  As a matter of fact, it's going to make things worse, which a lot of doctors believe.
[01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:21.085]  You know, different doctors have different opinions about different treatments, different drugs, about masks and so forth.
[01:55:21.085 --> 01:55:23.287]  And you should be able to make up your own mind.
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:26.841]  You should be able to determine if we have a free country.
[01:55:26.841 --> 01:55:27.521]  Is it a free country?
[01:55:27.521 --> 01:55:29.482]  You know, it used to be something we said when I was growing up.
[01:55:29.482 --> 01:55:31.582]  Well, hey man, you know, do you mind if I do?
[01:55:31.582 --> 01:55:33.723]  Wait, it's a free country.
[01:55:33.723 --> 01:55:35.163]  When's the last time you heard anybody say that?
[01:55:35.163 --> 01:55:36.104]  Nobody says that anymore.
[01:55:36.104 --> 01:55:40.065]  Everybody knows America is not a free country.
[01:55:40.065 --> 01:55:41.785]  Or don't make a federal case out of it.
[01:55:41.785 --> 01:55:44.626]  Everything is a federal case now.
[01:55:44.626 --> 01:55:46.867]  It's not free because we made everything a federal case.
[01:55:49.056 --> 01:55:51.418]  But people are starting to catch on as to what's going on.
[01:55:51.418 --> 01:56:10.591]  For example, in Spain, one of the places where they have been locked down the hardest, there is now, we got an article on Infowars.com, Spain activists launch grassroots uprising against the false pandemic and the tyranny that is being ushered in based on that.
[01:56:10.591 --> 01:56:15.435]  Spanish authorities recently announced face masks and social distancing protocols remain mandatory until
[01:56:16.343 --> 01:56:16.944]  Guess what?
[01:56:16.944 --> 01:56:18.545]  They've got an effective vaccine.
[01:56:18.545 --> 01:56:20.207]  What a surprise!
[01:56:20.207 --> 01:56:21.308]  Told you that was a process.
[01:56:21.308 --> 01:56:23.971]  You know why they're pushing the masks so hard now?
[01:56:23.971 --> 01:56:26.094]  And of course, they said, well, until we have an effective therapy.
[01:56:26.094 --> 01:56:35.063]  But when you have an effective therapy, they will do everything they can with a propaganda press to cover it up or to push back against it.
[01:56:35.063 --> 01:56:37.987]  They don't want you to hear about intravenous vitamin C.
[01:56:39.241 --> 01:56:42.783]  They don't want you to know about zinc and hydroxychloroquine.
[01:56:42.783 --> 01:56:51.148]  They fudge research papers, even to the extent that the Lancet had to pull it back to attack hydroxychloroquine.
[01:56:51.148 --> 01:56:55.010]  They come after Trump for talking about it.
[01:56:55.010 --> 01:56:57.911]  Said he's poisoning people, he's killing people by talking about hydroxychloroquine.
[01:56:57.911 --> 01:56:59.032]  No, they're the ones who are killing people.
[01:57:00.503 --> 01:57:06.206]  When they come up with a steroid that could be used to help people who are already in advanced respiratory distress.
[01:57:06.206 --> 01:57:06.566]  No, no, no.
[01:57:06.566 --> 01:57:07.586]  We're not going to talk about that either.
[01:57:07.586 --> 01:57:14.370]  We're certainly not going to talk about stem cells from umbilical cords, because we've got to keep a lid on that.
[01:57:14.370 --> 01:57:19.812]  The FDA has pushed really hard against using your own stem cells.
[01:57:19.812 --> 01:57:23.974]  The FDA has never regulated you using biologics.
[01:57:23.974 --> 01:57:25.215]  Your own biologics.
[01:57:25.215 --> 01:57:28.096]  Not even biologics from somebody else, but your own biologics.
[01:57:28.096 --> 01:57:29.537]  You can take stem cells
[01:57:30.603 --> 01:57:31.243]  Out of fat.
[01:57:31.243 --> 01:57:39.547]  They withdraw some fat from your body, put it in a centrifuge to get the stem cells, and then inject it back into your own body?
[01:57:39.547 --> 01:57:42.829]  And the FDA says you can't do that?
[01:57:42.829 --> 01:57:45.430]  You smell something fishy here?
[01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:49.692]  It's because they want to be able to patent stem cells from aborted fetuses.
[01:57:49.692 --> 01:57:51.733]  But you can get stem cells from a lot of different things.
[01:57:51.733 --> 01:57:55.495]  The FDA will say, well, you can get stem cells from your own bone marrow.
[01:57:55.495 --> 01:57:58.916]  That's a very expensive, very painful process.
[01:57:58.916 --> 01:57:59.477]  So they're waiting.
[01:58:00.461 --> 01:58:03.983]  Until they've got something else that they can push against you.
[01:58:03.983 --> 01:58:08.386]  But the FDA has never claimed that it had that kind of authority in the past.
[01:58:08.386 --> 01:58:11.048]  And now they have just moved into that area.
[01:58:11.048 --> 01:58:19.073]  As just as they're saying, well, you know, because of COVID-19, we've got to stop all buffets and salad bars, too.
[01:58:19.073 --> 01:58:23.296]  And they want to make sure, again, the face masks are core.
[01:58:23.296 --> 01:58:27.839]  Because this is ultimately about the fact that they're going to push back against any effective treatment.
[01:58:27.839 --> 01:58:29.180]  This is about making sure
[01:58:30.509 --> 01:58:34.211]  That you believe that you're not protected unless other people are wearing face masks.
[01:58:34.211 --> 01:58:36.733]  Just like you're not going to be protected unless other people are vaccinated.
[01:58:36.733 --> 01:58:49.881]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:49.881 --> 01:58:57.266]  David Rockefeller and other satanic pieces of garbage who thought they'd set up their world government.
[01:58:57.266 --> 01:58:58.527]  Believe they pulled the drain.
[01:58:59.870 --> 01:59:02.971]  on America a long time ago.
[01:59:02.971 --> 01:59:16.975]  But if we understand that they've orchestrated this by design, if there's a mass awakening, it can be their unraveling, their destruction, and them going down the drain.
[01:59:16.975 --> 01:59:22.017]  The Bible tells us that many times when the enemy digs a pit for us, they themselves fall into it.
[01:59:22.017 --> 01:59:26.158]  But God is the master of the universe, but gives us free will on this planet as a test.
[01:59:27.355 --> 01:59:33.820]  It is up to us to decide whether we're going down the drain or whether the globalists are going down the drain.
[01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:38.644]  I cannot express to listeners and viewers of this broadcast how important you are.
[01:59:38.644 --> 01:59:40.485]  Everything hinges on you.
[01:59:40.485 --> 01:59:41.426]  Everything.
[01:59:41.426 --> 01:59:45.349]  Peacefully become the Paul Revere you know you've always been.
[01:59:45.349 --> 01:59:45.749]  God bless.
[01:59:52.714 --> 01:59:59.757]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:59.757 --> 02:00:05.238]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[02:00:05.238 --> 02:00:14.442]  Alright, so here's an example of how this is a political
[02:00:15.535 --> 02:00:22.080]  Virus, we have the Wall Street Journal saying, early data shows no uptick in COVID-19 transmission from protests.
[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:24.922]  That's the one place you can't get it.
[02:00:24.922 --> 02:00:26.983]  I reported a couple of weeks ago on the morning show.
[02:00:26.983 --> 02:00:31.487]  Again, my show precedes this one, Monday through Friday.
[02:00:31.487 --> 02:00:37.691]  I talked about NPR and they ranked 12 or 15 different activities that you could do.
[02:00:37.691 --> 02:00:41.614]  And you know the one, there were two of them that were high risk.
[02:00:43.630 --> 02:00:48.994]  And one of them was going to church.
[02:00:48.994 --> 02:00:54.157]  It was higher risk than going to a nightclub.
[02:00:54.157 --> 02:00:56.859]  And so make sure you don't go to church.
[02:00:56.859 --> 02:00:58.881]  Because you're going to get sick if you go to church.
[02:00:58.881 --> 02:01:00.762]  You're going to get sick if you go to a Trump rally.
[02:01:00.762 --> 02:01:02.503]  But if you go to a protest, you're okay.
[02:01:02.503 --> 02:01:09.008]  And I guess maybe it's because, you know, the arson kills the virus, burns it up, right?
[02:01:09.008 --> 02:01:11.950]  As you're burning down the buildings, you're going to be fine.
[02:01:13.174 --> 02:01:15.416]  Early coronavirus testing data from a handful of U.S.
[02:01:15.416 --> 02:01:23.544]  cities and states suggests recent protests against racial injustice haven't led to a marked uptick in new cases.
[02:01:23.544 --> 02:01:29.369]  And again, you're not getting an uptick anywhere with this.
[02:01:29.369 --> 02:01:35.875]  What they do to keep this going is they're showing you now the total number of people who died, according to the CDC.
[02:01:37.190 --> 02:01:42.091]  And these, as we've talked about many times in the past, did you die from coronavirus?
[02:01:42.091 --> 02:01:43.291]  Did you die with coronavirus?
[02:01:43.291 --> 02:01:46.092]  Did you even test to see if they had coronavirus?
[02:01:46.092 --> 02:01:46.552]  No, no, no.
[02:01:46.552 --> 02:01:52.253]  We will just go by the CDC statistics and we'll keep bumping that number up forever.
[02:01:52.253 --> 02:01:57.674]  Cuomo, meanwhile, says, I wouldn't even allow a large political rally in New York.
[02:01:57.674 --> 02:02:02.055]  Oh yeah, Trump's got this rally coming up in Tulsa tomorrow, so he's upset about that.
[02:02:03.369 --> 02:02:08.552]  Because, you know, the protests are not political rallies at all, right?
[02:02:08.552 --> 02:02:09.292]  You understand that.
[02:02:09.292 --> 02:02:10.733]  They're not political rallies at all.
[02:02:10.733 --> 02:02:12.994]  And the Tulsa people are not happy about this either.
[02:02:12.994 --> 02:02:20.798]  They say, we haven't gotten a plan about how the Trump people are going to keep people safe at this rally.
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:24.280]  Let me tell you how you keep people safe.
[02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:31.782]  You respect their individual liberty, you respect the Constitution, and you tell them what you think, and then leave it up to them to make those choices.
[02:02:31.782 --> 02:02:49.507]  If you take away people's informed choices, if you interject yourself into the doctor-patient relationship, into the parent-child relationship in order to force certain medical treatments, or to prohibit people from having medical treatments that they want, like their own stem cells, this is nothing but medical tyranny, folks.
[02:02:51.338 --> 02:03:04.831]  So, when you look at the way the propaganda press is spinning this, AP says, poll shows, Gallup poll shows, Americans are not buying White House spin on the coronavirus, Vice President Pence.
[02:03:04.831 --> 02:03:05.372]  Says the U.S.
[02:03:05.372 --> 02:03:09.236]  response to the coronavirus pandemic is a cause for celebration.
[02:03:09.236 --> 02:03:13.360]  But a new poll finds more than half of Americans calling it fair or poor.
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:14.381]  So, now the question is,
[02:03:15.523 --> 02:03:21.085]  Did they ask people, did you want the government to do more or less?
[02:03:21.085 --> 02:03:35.512]  Because quite frankly, I would rank what the White House and what governors have done, Democrat and Republican, because if you lock down half of our freedoms here, we're still not free.
[02:03:35.512 --> 02:03:40.414]  But I would rank all of our government officials as poor.
[02:03:42.392 --> 02:03:43.393]  As poor.
[02:03:43.393 --> 02:03:45.775]  Because I think they did too much, but that's not the way they're reading this.
[02:03:45.775 --> 02:03:47.616]  They're saying, well, he didn't do enough.
[02:03:47.616 --> 02:03:49.578]  We're not happy with this.
[02:03:49.578 --> 02:03:52.921]  So it doesn't matter whether you think that they went too far or not far enough.
[02:03:52.921 --> 02:04:01.308]  Oh, well, the Gallup poll is going to say everybody disagrees with the White House, because it is about nothing but politics.
[02:04:01.308 --> 02:04:09.395]  Coronavirus cases are spiking, says CBS, and experts in Florida say it's got all the markings of the next epicenter.
[02:04:10.250 --> 02:04:19.497]  And again, this is why they want to do this, and this is why the officials in Key West have said, well, we're going to extend this until June of 2021.
[02:04:19.497 --> 02:04:25.622]  They have no idea why they have to do it for another year, but hey, just another year.
[02:04:26.869 --> 02:04:31.292]  I remember from the very beginning, we were talking about how this was their goal.
[02:04:31.292 --> 02:04:36.015]  How they had to be opposed, not just fired, but they had to be opposed.
[02:04:36.015 --> 02:04:41.298]  Their lies had to be deconstructed with people who have told us the truth from the very beginning.
[02:04:41.298 --> 02:04:43.739]  From before it began.
[02:04:43.739 --> 02:04:50.464]  Because their agenda is to lock us down and to keep us locked down because it is to tear this country apart.
[02:04:50.464 --> 02:04:53.766]  You know, when I look at what people have
[02:04:55.267 --> 02:05:05.854]  I've been saying even before this began, even before this began, months before this began, you had people talking about the fourth turning like I've been saying.
[02:05:05.854 --> 02:05:07.735]  We are accelerating towards the climax.
[02:05:07.735 --> 02:05:12.558]  The anti-lockdown protesters could become violent if the U.S.
[02:05:12.558 --> 02:05:14.359]  revives quarantine measures.
[02:05:14.359 --> 02:05:23.584]  This was two days before they took the George Floyd death and used that to do that very thing.
[02:05:23.584 --> 02:05:24.305]  They already knew.
[02:05:25.435 --> 02:05:26.676]  That the conditions were right.
[02:05:26.676 --> 02:05:32.919]  They knew that we were at a point in generational history where there was going to be some kind of a change.
[02:05:32.919 --> 02:05:41.704]  We can either have a freer society or we can have a society that is far more authoritarian and locked down.
[02:05:41.704 --> 02:05:46.067]  And so they put their own plandemic in place.
[02:05:46.067 --> 02:05:53.671]  And as they locked us down, this is why I'm talking about this because you know when you go back you won't talk about Chazistan, East and West Chazistan.
[02:05:54.847 --> 02:05:58.048]  Seattle and Minneapolis.
[02:05:58.048 --> 02:06:07.691]  You can talk about that, but understand the root of that is this lockdown that was put in place based on Fauci and the CDC.
[02:06:07.691 --> 02:06:10.672]  And the DHS Department of Homeland Security was warning.
[02:06:10.672 --> 02:06:14.253]  They said, hey, protesters could get violent if the U.S.
[02:06:14.253 --> 02:06:18.294]  revives quarantine measures because they've had it at this point.
[02:06:18.294 --> 02:06:19.034]  So what did they do?
[02:06:19.034 --> 02:06:23.616]  Well, they engineered a, they cherry-picked
[02:06:25.231 --> 02:06:29.315]  An incident, and made it all about race.
[02:06:29.315 --> 02:06:33.660]  And people were ready to fight at that point in time.
[02:06:33.660 --> 02:06:43.609]  Now you've got, in the Washington Examiner, they're saying people would be crushed by a second coronavirus wave, say psychologists.
[02:06:43.609 --> 02:06:49.035]  I think a second wave would be devastating for a lot of people, said a professor of psychology at the University of Connecticut.
[02:06:50.015 --> 02:06:57.199]  Dr. Crystal Park, there is a sense that we've been through a really terrible traumatic time and we're now in a phase of reopening and recovery.
[02:06:57.199 --> 02:07:00.380]  So that's why they have to push it right now.
[02:07:00.380 --> 02:07:02.121]  That's why they had to push the George Floyd thing.
[02:07:02.121 --> 02:07:10.485]  They get everybody, they wait until the moment is right in history, and then they push the plandemic.
[02:07:10.485 --> 02:07:15.508]  Then after they've got everybody locked down for three months, they create a race war scenario.
[02:07:17.199 --> 02:07:20.340]  And then they add to it, they bring back the pandemic.
[02:07:20.340 --> 02:07:25.781]  They push the pause button, and now they're going to re-accelerate it.
[02:07:25.781 --> 02:07:29.762]  An article on Zero Hedge from the American Institute for Economic Research says, spike?
[02:07:29.762 --> 02:07:30.902]  What spike?
[02:07:30.902 --> 02:07:38.084]  Hospitalization data shows no indication of a second wave, but you wouldn't know that if you look at the mainstream press.
[02:07:38.084 --> 02:07:41.684]  Everywhere they're telling everybody, we gotta take more drastic measures now.
[02:07:41.684 --> 02:07:44.145]  We're gonna have mandatory masks now.
[02:07:46.151 --> 02:07:50.953]  We're not going to allow you to get out from under our thumb.
[02:07:50.953 --> 02:07:53.974]  And as you look at Fox News, alarm!
[02:07:53.974 --> 02:08:01.597]  As vaccine foes and anti-mask activists target public health officials.
[02:08:01.597 --> 02:08:02.778]  Oh yeah.
[02:08:02.778 --> 02:08:05.759]  We're the bad guys.
[02:08:05.759 --> 02:08:08.420]  They usurp their authority.
[02:08:10.623 --> 02:08:19.787]  An alliance of anti-vaccine activists and those protesting California's coronavirus-related restrictions are alarming public health officials.
[02:08:19.787 --> 02:08:22.468]  Our dictators, our new doctators.
[02:08:22.468 --> 02:08:27.550]  The people who will shut us down at will and keep us locked down for another year if they feel like it.
[02:08:27.550 --> 02:08:30.232]  They just did that in Key West.
[02:08:30.232 --> 02:08:36.654]  Everywhere in California, mass protesters have called for similar rallies outside the homes of public health officers.
[02:08:36.654 --> 02:08:38.935]  See, we shouldn't be allowed to protest these.
[02:08:38.935 --> 02:08:39.756]  It's wonderful.
[02:08:40.646 --> 02:08:47.093]  If we protest the police, it's wonderful if we protest and burn in the name of racism.
[02:08:47.093 --> 02:08:55.663]  But hey, if they're going to lock you down and enslave you arbitrarily, these unelected officials, don't you dare show up and protest them!
[02:08:55.663 --> 02:08:59.748]  And we saw this in Michigan with Whitmer.
[02:08:59.748 --> 02:09:01.330]  Furious that people would show up.
[02:09:02.378 --> 02:09:07.280]  In their cars, with their windows rolled up, and honk their horns in protest.
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:08.001]  Oh, that's horrible.
[02:09:08.001 --> 02:09:11.282]  And yet, they could come out and protest cheek to cheek.
[02:09:11.282 --> 02:09:17.125]  You'd have the police officers take off their masks and do selfies with people.
[02:09:17.125 --> 02:09:19.986]  And that's wonderful.
[02:09:19.986 --> 02:09:25.369]  Customers are reportedly having tantrums over wearing masks, writes the Detroit News.
[02:09:25.369 --> 02:09:26.369]  Yeah.
[02:09:26.369 --> 02:09:27.850]  I think the best headline I've seen
[02:09:29.082 --> 02:09:31.504]  Is tear down this plexiglass.
[02:09:31.504 --> 02:09:33.605]  Paraphrasing Ronald Reagan.
[02:09:33.605 --> 02:09:34.225]  I'll just say that.
[02:09:34.225 --> 02:09:39.328]  Mr. President, tear down this plexiglass.
[02:09:39.328 --> 02:09:44.211]  You're allowing these people to destroy this country and they're going to destroy your chances of re-election as well.
[02:09:44.211 --> 02:09:44.852]  We'll be right back.
[02:09:44.852 --> 02:09:45.192]  Stay with us.
[02:09:52.446 --> 02:10:00.634]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax, and now it's the
[02:10:02.415 --> 02:10:04.257]  Race riot hoax of 2020.
[02:10:04.257 --> 02:10:07.620]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next.
[02:10:07.620 --> 02:10:13.887]  Well, I can tell you it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war.
[02:10:13.887 --> 02:10:19.692]  It's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it.
[02:10:19.692 --> 02:10:22.175]  The globalists are attacking on every front.
[02:10:22.175 --> 02:10:23.016]  That's why now
[02:10:23.616 --> 02:10:33.607]  More than ever, we have to realize they tried to censor InfoWars off the air because they knew when they watched this whole situation that they didn't want the people's voice to still be on air.
[02:10:33.607 --> 02:10:37.792]  But thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air.
[02:10:37.792 --> 02:10:42.036]  So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now more than ever.
[02:10:42.036 --> 02:10:45.039]  InfoWars.com lives!
[02:10:46.140 --> 02:10:48.901]  Just during the break, I went and got a delicious cup.
[02:10:48.901 --> 02:10:50.042]  My second cup of the day.
[02:10:50.042 --> 02:10:50.942]  It's really strong.
[02:10:50.942 --> 02:10:51.883]  I shouldn't do this.
[02:10:51.883 --> 02:10:54.924]  Because all work and no play makes Jack a really aggressive boy.
[02:10:54.924 --> 02:10:56.345]  And the coffee adds to it, but mmm.
[02:10:56.345 --> 02:10:58.046]  Wake Up America Coffee there by Love's.
[02:10:58.046 --> 02:10:58.746]  Highest rated.
[02:10:58.746 --> 02:10:59.886]  From the choppest mountains.
[02:10:59.886 --> 02:11:01.107]  It's beyond Mexican coffee.
[02:11:01.107 --> 02:11:02.107]  Beyond Guatemalan coffee.
[02:11:02.107 --> 02:11:03.028]  It's the best coffee in the world.
[02:11:03.288 --> 02:11:03.548]  Yes, folks.
[02:11:03.548 --> 02:11:04.349]  We've been selling it 10 years.
[02:11:04.349 --> 02:11:05.189]  Never raised the price.
[02:11:05.189 --> 02:11:06.370]  $19.95 for that big ol' bag.
[02:11:06.370 --> 02:11:06.730]  99% reviews.
[02:11:06.730 --> 02:11:07.051]  598 reviews.
[02:11:07.051 --> 02:11:08.231]  4.9 stars on third-party sites.
[02:11:33.368 --> 02:11:41.274]  Fifteen days, nine months, Patriots blend, medium roast, only has a 98% out of 814 reviews.
[02:11:41.274 --> 02:11:43.576]  It's not as popular.
[02:11:43.576 --> 02:11:49.500]  Anyways, it's all at infowarestore.com.
[02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:52.142]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:09.528 --> 02:12:13.249]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:12:13.249 --> 02:12:15.549]  Run on for a long time.
[02:12:15.549 --> 02:12:18.990]  Run on for a long time.
[02:12:18.990 --> 02:12:21.951]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[02:12:21.951 --> 02:12:26.372]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[02:12:26.372 --> 02:12:29.792]  Mr. President, tear down this plexiglass.
[02:12:29.792 --> 02:12:32.893]  There's a great article from American Institute for Economic Research.
[02:12:32.893 --> 02:12:36.874]  A guy talking about his experiences at the gym that he used to attend.
[02:12:38.104 --> 02:12:40.906]  Before the lockdown three months ago.
[02:12:40.906 --> 02:12:48.312]  He said, on Monday, June 16th, I was finally given government permission to return to the gymnasium I'd been affiliated with for over two decades.
[02:12:48.312 --> 02:12:49.252]  He goes, I like it.
[02:12:49.252 --> 02:12:50.633]  He goes, I go for the people.
[02:12:50.633 --> 02:12:53.375]  The desk staff knows me pretty well.
[02:12:53.375 --> 02:12:57.798]  They like that I usually come in with some kind of a quirk or remark that generates a chuckle or two.
[02:12:57.798 --> 02:13:01.961]  Every time I enter, my goal is to get them to laugh, and there's always some chit-chat.
[02:13:01.961 --> 02:13:06.124]  Each day, I find out a little bit more about them, and they discover a little bit more about me.
[02:13:07.128 --> 02:13:10.670]  Where they went the night before and what muscles are aching on me today.
[02:13:10.670 --> 02:13:15.614]  But he said, now, however, there is plexiglass.
[02:13:15.614 --> 02:13:23.499]  When I arrived on Monday the first time back in at least 14 weeks, I had to go first to a check, to a check-in tent just outside the doors.
[02:13:24.807 --> 02:13:27.848]  There, I had to sign a waiver about the coronavirus.
[02:13:27.848 --> 02:13:31.489]  I had to answer a set of questions about any symptoms that I might have.
[02:13:31.489 --> 02:13:37.451]  Then, get my temperature taken remotely by a gentleman with a mask and one of those thermal scanners.
[02:13:37.451 --> 02:13:43.494]  Once I passed that gauntlet, I could walk through the doors that were propped open so I didn't have to touch the handle.
[02:13:43.494 --> 02:13:52.897]  In the lobby, I was shocked to see that the main desk now had giant sheets of plexiglass in front of the two stations where the staff usually stands and hands out towels.
[02:13:53.857 --> 02:13:55.298]  It looked odd.
[02:13:55.298 --> 02:13:59.240]  We were not allowed to get towels, let alone shower there.
[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:04.382]  I had to bring my own small sweat rags.
[02:14:04.382 --> 02:14:06.703]  And then there's that plexiglass.
[02:14:06.703 --> 02:14:10.185]  Everything felt different because of the plexiglass.
[02:14:10.185 --> 02:14:14.947]  Back in the old days of the West, banks would have steel bars and separate them from the customers.
[02:14:14.947 --> 02:14:18.389]  This was done to make it more difficult to jump over the counter and rob the bank.
[02:14:19.551 --> 02:14:25.253]  Because in a world of transient individuals and many strangers passing through, you never knew who to trust.
[02:14:25.253 --> 02:14:37.558]  In crime-ridden areas today, metal bars and thick plexiglass separate customers from staff in pawnshops and check cashing facilities and liquor stores and places that are targets for robbery.
[02:14:37.558 --> 02:14:43.341]  Places where trust between individuals is unfortunately low.
[02:14:43.341 --> 02:14:46.802]  Such a lack of trust is not good for the economy.
[02:14:48.540 --> 02:14:56.964]  And he says, metal bars and plexiglass cases also breed distrust and damage our willingness to exchange and to interact with each other.
[02:14:56.964 --> 02:14:58.205]  And of course, there's also the mask.
[02:14:58.205 --> 02:15:01.626]  You can't see people's expressions.
[02:15:01.626 --> 02:15:11.671]  One psychologist said, it's not just the frustration of being locked down and then told suddenly, well, you can go out if you'll protest or riot or attack white people.
[02:15:13.404 --> 02:15:18.047]  He said it's also the fact that it's accelerated the misunderstanding between people.
[02:15:18.047 --> 02:15:19.248]  How do you read somebody else?
[02:15:19.248 --> 02:15:20.308]  How do you read their intentions?
[02:15:20.308 --> 02:15:27.693]  When you get out on the street, in a protest, when you can't see people's, most of their faces covered up.
[02:15:27.693 --> 02:15:30.434]  It accelerates that.
[02:15:30.434 --> 02:15:33.276]  He said now plexiglass is everywhere.
[02:15:33.276 --> 02:15:36.438]  Suburban grocery stores, small town restaurants, gymnasiums.
[02:15:37.748 --> 02:15:40.509]  It's good for the plexiglass manufacturers, but it's bad for us.
[02:15:40.509 --> 02:15:41.989]  And let me tell you what it's really bad for.
[02:15:41.989 --> 02:15:43.230]  It's bad for small businesses.
[02:15:43.230 --> 02:15:46.151]  You think that business is going to stay in business?
[02:15:46.151 --> 02:15:49.732]  What they're doing is they're turning America into East Germany.
[02:15:49.732 --> 02:15:52.373]  That's why I said it's a perfect title.
[02:15:52.373 --> 02:15:54.694]  He didn't make that comparison, but yeah.
[02:15:54.694 --> 02:16:00.616]  President Trump teared down this plexiglass wall.
[02:16:00.616 --> 02:16:06.978]  You didn't build a wall at the border, but boy, we've got walls everywhere between each other now within this country.
[02:16:08.134 --> 02:16:12.815]  They have locked us down.
[02:16:12.815 --> 02:16:22.518]  In East Germany, it wasn't just the Stasi snitch society, where everybody was keeping notes on everybody else.
[02:16:22.518 --> 02:16:31.261]  And I've talked about this, the diary, as they started looking at what the people in East Germany were doing to each other.
[02:16:33.076 --> 02:16:40.659]  One American who went to East Germany, because she, like these anti-far Marxists, she loved communism and she wanted to get as much of it as she could.
[02:16:40.659 --> 02:16:43.661]  So she went to the heart of it in East Germany.
[02:16:43.661 --> 02:16:50.824]  She went there to go to school and she met an East German and married him.
[02:16:50.824 --> 02:16:53.985]  Now that made him suspicious to them.
[02:16:53.985 --> 02:17:01.629]  And so, to her surprise, she found out decades later, as people were going through the records of the Stasi, she found out that she and her husband were the focus
[02:17:02.808 --> 02:17:06.870]  of suspicion by the East Germans.
[02:17:06.870 --> 02:17:15.333]  And to her consternation, she found out that many of their closest friends had been informants for the Stasi as well.
[02:17:15.333 --> 02:17:22.275]  It didn't put her off of her love of communism, however, you know, because it just hasn't been tried the right way.
[02:17:22.275 --> 02:17:24.516]  We always hear that, right?
[02:17:24.516 --> 02:17:26.377]  But one of the things that she said that really stuck with me
[02:17:27.332 --> 02:17:33.135]  Well, she said, you would talk to people in East Germany in a private capacity.
[02:17:33.135 --> 02:17:39.258]  You know, you're just in an informal setting where they're not working on their job.
[02:17:39.258 --> 02:17:42.340]  And she said, they'd just be the nicest people.
[02:17:42.340 --> 02:17:48.843]  But then you might go into where this person works in, let's say, a butcher shop.
[02:17:48.843 --> 02:17:52.365]  And they're so officious.
[02:17:52.365 --> 02:17:54.106]  They have power.
[02:17:54.106 --> 02:17:56.307]  It's not just the informants that are everywhere.
[02:17:57.520 --> 02:18:17.907]  But it's the fact that when everybody is being bossed around for every little arbitrary reason, then once they get into a position where they are in a shop and you have to go there to use your ration checks or your cash to buy something from that shop, now they've got power over you.
[02:18:17.907 --> 02:18:23.469]  It's what we see happening throughout the airline industry and has been happening for a while.
[02:18:24.631 --> 02:18:36.980]  Once they put in all kinds of regulations at the airline industry in the wake of 9-11, you saw the airline stewardesses and attendants, the people at the gate, everywhere in the airport.
[02:18:36.980 --> 02:18:39.121]  People get officious, don't they?
[02:18:39.121 --> 02:18:42.283]  They've got rules and regulations and you better follow these rules and regulations.
[02:18:42.283 --> 02:18:45.025]  I'm telling you what you've got to do.
[02:18:45.025 --> 02:18:51.069]  And now with this lockdown, we've seen this being put out everywhere in our society.
[02:18:51.069 --> 02:18:51.490]  My wife
[02:18:52.383 --> 02:18:58.769]  She goes to Costco, has noticed, she told me weeks that she doesn't go anymore.
[02:18:58.769 --> 02:19:03.714]  The first three weeks, it began to get worse and worse.
[02:19:03.714 --> 02:19:08.818]  As they started to put in their policies about what people had to do.
[02:19:08.818 --> 02:19:16.566]  And they would first just kind of suggest that you should wear a mask, and then they started getting more and more in your face about it.
[02:19:18.013 --> 02:19:23.318]  Uh, gave her kind of, you know, she wasn't wearing a mask, she was in line outside the store.
[02:19:23.318 --> 02:19:29.703]  Lady stopped right next to her and then does, doesn't address her directly, but addresses the crowd standing right next to her.
[02:19:29.703 --> 02:19:33.566]  And she was the only person in line who was not wearing a mask.
[02:19:33.566 --> 02:19:36.469]  For your safety, we would suggest that you wear a mask.
[02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:43.194]  And then the next week when she went, so that's kind of oblique, the next week she directly engaged her, told her, you must wear a mask.
[02:19:43.194 --> 02:19:43.775]  It's the law.
[02:19:44.673 --> 02:19:50.097]  See, this is how America is being turned into East Germany.
[02:19:50.097 --> 02:19:54.620]  That aspect, plus the fear aspect that people are afraid to go anywhere.
[02:19:54.620 --> 02:20:02.165]  As a matter of fact, it's not just the restaurant industry.
[02:20:02.165 --> 02:20:11.551]  They're saying, well, you know, we're going to be allowed to reopen 50-50, and so it basically is a suicide pact, as Reason Magazine points out.
[02:20:11.551 --> 02:20:14.113]  These phased reopenings are going to be too little, too late.
[02:20:14.912 --> 02:20:22.296]  If you're going to open up a restaurant, even here in Texas, our Republican Governor Abbott has graciously allowed us to be half free.
[02:20:22.296 --> 02:20:26.478]  Even Austin, you know, the little Marxist here who put on the mandatory stuff.
[02:20:26.478 --> 02:20:29.160]  Well, you don't have to wear a mask if you're eating or drinking.
[02:20:29.160 --> 02:20:29.560]  Oh, really?
[02:20:29.560 --> 02:20:30.120]  I don't?
[02:20:30.120 --> 02:20:35.363]  Matter of fact, you don't have to wear that even on airlines if you're eating a pretzel.
[02:20:35.363 --> 02:20:42.987]  But they have instructions on how you can put that emergency mask that drops down out of the top thing there, how you can put that over your temporary mask.
[02:20:42.987 --> 02:20:44.148]  That's the insanity we're seeing.
[02:20:45.745 --> 02:20:47.507]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[02:20:47.507 --> 02:20:47.968]  You're on the air.
[02:20:47.968 --> 02:20:48.849]  Thanks for holding.
[02:20:48.849 --> 02:20:50.231]  I sure can, sir.
[02:20:50.231 --> 02:20:50.912]  Thank you.
[02:20:50.912 --> 02:20:54.396]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[02:21:01.545 --> 02:21:03.006]  I just want to plug in.
[02:21:03.006 --> 02:21:07.430]  I'm a truck driver and two before us have changed the way I drive.
[02:21:07.430 --> 02:21:09.332]  Me and my brothers that drive.
[02:21:09.332 --> 02:21:10.673]  There's a couple of us.
[02:21:10.673 --> 02:21:14.055]  We're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[02:21:14.055 --> 02:21:22.022]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank you for
[02:21:22.823 --> 02:21:28.467]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term high-quality energy powder there is.
[02:21:28.467 --> 02:21:30.749]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[02:21:30.749 --> 02:21:33.231]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues.
[02:21:33.231 --> 02:21:35.894]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[02:21:35.894 --> 02:21:39.937]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[02:21:39.937 --> 02:21:41.718]  And you're saying that it's made your life better?
[02:21:41.718 --> 02:21:42.459]  So that means a lot to me.
[02:21:42.459 --> 02:21:42.799]  Thank you.
[02:21:42.799 --> 02:21:44.221]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[02:21:44.963 --> 02:21:47.424]  I was talking to my Patriot supplier, Great Suppliers.
[02:21:47.424 --> 02:21:50.364]  You can now say four weeks on average for storable food.
[02:21:50.364 --> 02:21:51.424]  It's the highest quality.
[02:21:51.424 --> 02:21:52.845]  They've got it.
[02:21:52.845 --> 02:21:59.246]  Use this little rest we have, caught in the current, to come up to the surface, get some air, before you get sucked back down.
[02:21:59.246 --> 02:22:01.767]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[02:22:01.767 --> 02:22:04.707]  I have to now start going into defense posture.
[02:22:04.707 --> 02:22:09.968]  80% is offense, but I've always been 100% offense, trying to fully, you know, stop the Globeless.
[02:22:09.968 --> 02:22:13.289]  And we've given them a good run, and I think down the road they'll be defeated, but
[02:22:14.534 --> 02:22:17.296]  We're gonna still go down the hard road now.
[02:22:17.296 --> 02:22:23.200]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still gonna be bad in my view.
[02:22:23.200 --> 02:22:24.701]  You need to get high-quality, storable food.
[02:22:24.701 --> 02:22:25.921]  It's something you need.
[02:22:25.921 --> 02:22:36.928]  We have high-quality ready to get out to you, and it supports the broadcast and 360Win, so please take care of your storable foods needs at InfoWareStore.com and get your orders in now, so you get it, so you have it.
[02:22:36.928 --> 02:22:39.730]  It's in great containers, high-quality, lasts 25 years.
[02:22:39.730 --> 02:22:43.733]  Get it while you can, because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[02:22:44.525 --> 02:22:46.889]  I'm always excited about InfoWars Life products.
[02:22:46.889 --> 02:22:47.450]  They're amazing.
[02:22:47.450 --> 02:22:48.132]  They're cutting edge.
[02:22:48.132 --> 02:22:48.572]  You love them.
[02:22:48.572 --> 02:22:49.214]  I love them.
[02:22:49.214 --> 02:22:52.860]  And they fund the InfoWars in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[02:22:52.860 --> 02:22:56.807]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development.
[02:22:57.955 --> 02:22:59.596]  That is amazing.
[02:22:59.596 --> 02:23:07.279]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[02:23:07.279 --> 02:23:09.600]  And there's another innovation.
[02:23:09.600 --> 02:23:11.681]  It's the spray cap.
[02:23:11.681 --> 02:23:17.103]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross goo, but it's high quality.
[02:23:17.103 --> 02:23:19.264]  It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[02:23:19.264 --> 02:23:20.165]  I like to put it on my hands.
[02:23:20.925 --> 02:23:22.426]  Rub a little bit on my face.
[02:23:22.426 --> 02:23:25.247]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so don't spray it right in your eyes.
[02:23:25.247 --> 02:23:26.828]  But I just love it.
[02:23:26.828 --> 02:23:29.649]  Personally, as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[02:23:29.649 --> 02:23:31.450]  So, this is a real innovation.
[02:23:31.450 --> 02:23:37.974]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out.
[02:23:37.974 --> 02:23:39.314]  Smells great.
[02:23:39.314 --> 02:23:41.135]  It's so refreshing.
[02:23:41.135 --> 02:23:47.598]  This is a big winner.
[02:23:47.598 --> 02:23:50.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:00.247 --> 02:24:04.009]  Don't know much about history.
[02:24:04.009 --> 02:24:07.751]  Don't know much biology.
[02:24:07.751 --> 02:24:11.513]  Don't know much about a science book.
[02:24:11.513 --> 02:24:15.235]  Don't know much about the French I took.
[02:24:15.235 --> 02:24:20.298]  But I do know that I love you.
[02:24:20.298 --> 02:24:22.940]  I love you too.
[02:24:22.940 --> 02:24:24.160]  Don't know much about history.
[02:24:24.160 --> 02:24:26.362]  Don't know much about science and climate change.
[02:24:26.362 --> 02:24:28.483]  But oh, we know we love AOC, right?
[02:24:29.465 --> 02:24:39.529]  Yeah, Twitter kept badgering my wife to follow AOC and to turn off notifications from me and then finally they just unfollowed her from me.
[02:24:39.529 --> 02:24:43.790]  If you want to follow me, you can follow me at Libertarian, but they may not send you any notifications.
[02:24:43.790 --> 02:24:45.691]  You'll have to go there directly.
[02:24:45.691 --> 02:24:55.615]  As we're talking about the psychological and political lockdown that's going on now, the plan-demic, it enraged a lot of people
[02:24:56.815 --> 02:24:59.958]  That movie theater chains are going to be opening in mid-July.
[02:24:59.958 --> 02:25:02.520]  AMC theaters, Regal Cinemas, Cinemark.
[02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:05.183]  Oh no, you can't do this.
[02:25:05.183 --> 02:25:13.170]  One of them, the AMC, announced that they will sell masks, if you want them, for a dollar.
[02:25:13.170 --> 02:25:18.114]  But they said employees will be required to wear protective equipment, but you won't.
[02:25:18.114 --> 02:25:23.099]  You can wear protective equipment if you wish, but again, this goes back to the psychology of the mask.
[02:25:24.787 --> 02:25:28.749]  And, as I pointed out the other day, why do they call it N95?
[02:25:28.749 --> 02:25:34.992]  Because it gets 95% of the particles that are 0.3 microns or bigger.
[02:25:34.992 --> 02:25:41.735]  The COVID virus is 0.125 microns.
[02:25:41.735 --> 02:25:46.478]  Well, they say, it's going to catch the spit and keep that from happening.
[02:25:46.478 --> 02:25:50.200]  Well, doesn't that work then if you've got it in front of your face or whatever?
[02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:50.560]  No, no, no.
[02:25:53.689 --> 02:25:56.991]  You're not safe unless I wear a mask.
[02:25:56.991 --> 02:26:00.872]  I'm not safe unless you wear a mask.
[02:26:00.872 --> 02:26:03.713]  That's Barney science.
[02:26:03.713 --> 02:26:05.194]  I love you.
[02:26:05.194 --> 02:26:06.414]  You love me.
[02:26:06.414 --> 02:26:08.955]  But this is the whole idea behind the vaccine.
[02:26:08.955 --> 02:26:12.277]  The vaccines don't work unless everybody gets them.
[02:26:12.277 --> 02:26:16.078]  It's not going to protect you unless I get a vaccine.
[02:26:16.078 --> 02:26:19.860]  And that's why they're pushing this because the endgame on this is the vaccine.
[02:26:21.206 --> 02:26:22.626]  And that's what concerns me so much.
[02:26:22.626 --> 02:26:32.108]  President Trump is pouring billions of dollars into vaccine development and vaccine manufacturing and telling them, we're not going to worry about testing.
[02:26:32.108 --> 02:26:33.468]  We're going to have this out by the end of the year.
[02:26:33.468 --> 02:26:33.848]  Why?
[02:26:33.848 --> 02:26:35.689]  Because he wants it for the economy.
[02:26:35.689 --> 02:26:43.710]  He doesn't care about the safety or the efficacy or the Constitution or your individual liberty or your informed consent or free choice.
[02:26:43.710 --> 02:26:48.631]  None of that is important to these people, Republican or Democrat.
[02:26:48.631 --> 02:26:49.931]  It's absolutely reprehensible.
[02:26:52.193 --> 02:26:57.897]  And so these people are now calling the CEO of AMC an idiot.
[02:26:57.897 --> 02:27:00.419]  He says, I just don't want to get drawn into a political controversy.
[02:27:00.419 --> 02:27:01.059]  I'm going to wear it.
[02:27:01.059 --> 02:27:01.859]  I think it's a good thing.
[02:27:01.859 --> 02:27:04.421]  I think you ought to wear it, but I'm not going to force you to wear it.
[02:27:04.421 --> 02:27:12.767]  Oh, but see, we have to, if I think a certain way, you must think that certain way as well, or you're going to be kicked off of social media.
[02:27:12.767 --> 02:27:17.990]  If you say something different, if you say something that I don't agree with, or I don't like, I'm going to kick you off.
[02:27:17.990 --> 02:27:20.372]  This whole mask thing is part of the cancel culture.
[02:27:22.406 --> 02:27:29.672]  It's about, all of this is about a mandate that is being forced upon us.
[02:27:29.672 --> 02:27:34.275]  As a Federalist, here's the reason why they want to kick them off.
[02:27:34.275 --> 02:27:36.117]  Because they say the same sorts of things we say.
[02:27:37.714 --> 02:27:42.715]  Americans should never again comply with pandemic lockdown orders.
[02:27:42.715 --> 02:27:44.476]  Never comply with orders!
[02:27:44.476 --> 02:27:46.036]  I've tweeted this out over and over again.
[02:27:46.036 --> 02:27:49.297]  I say, I'm all for medical advice.
[02:27:49.297 --> 02:27:51.578]  I'm all ears when it comes to medical advice.
[02:27:51.578 --> 02:27:54.659]  I have an open mind when it comes to medical advice.
[02:27:54.659 --> 02:27:58.120]  But I don't take orders from any doctor or any politician.
[02:27:58.120 --> 02:27:59.540]  I'm sorry, you make this an order?
[02:28:00.595 --> 02:28:12.100]  Well, now it's my delight to disobey that order, because you don't have the authority to do this, and there are more important things than getting sick.
[02:28:12.100 --> 02:28:13.621]  Live free or die.
[02:28:13.621 --> 02:28:17.242]  Jobless claims have now totaled one and a half million.
[02:28:17.242 --> 02:28:21.304]  But we were told by the Department of Labor that things improved.
[02:28:21.304 --> 02:28:26.486]  And then they said, oh wait, you know, it would be at least another three or four points higher if we defined it differently.
[02:28:26.486 --> 02:28:28.107]  And I said, before that came out,
[02:28:28.871 --> 02:28:31.752]  I said, look, when the government gives you statistics, they're always lying.
[02:28:31.752 --> 02:28:35.414]  Whether it's the CDC, they're going to inflate the COVID deaths.
[02:28:35.414 --> 02:28:41.237]  If it's the unemployment, if it's the Bureau of Labor Statistics, they're going to lie to make it look better.
[02:28:41.237 --> 02:28:45.459]  And every quarter, they will revise the figures.
[02:28:45.459 --> 02:28:47.760]  And this is not something that's just the Trump administration.
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:51.261]  It's always done by them, to make every administration look better.
[02:28:51.261 --> 02:28:54.643]  They will always revise up
[02:28:55.711 --> 02:28:58.412]  The unemployment figures as they release the new ones.
[02:28:58.412 --> 02:29:00.212]  They'll revise up the previous one.
[02:29:00.212 --> 02:29:02.033]  So the trend always looks good.
[02:29:02.033 --> 02:29:04.433]  They always do that.
[02:29:04.433 --> 02:29:06.394]  And so we got another one and a half million people.
[02:29:06.394 --> 02:29:10.035]  Take a look at this video that was posted up.
[02:29:10.035 --> 02:29:11.895]  We have a problem.
[02:29:11.895 --> 02:29:13.576]  This isn't a protest.
[02:29:13.576 --> 02:29:14.676]  Video clip number two.
[02:29:14.676 --> 02:29:16.436]  Roll that as b-roll here.
[02:29:16.436 --> 02:29:18.457]  This isn't a protest.
[02:29:18.457 --> 02:29:19.657]  It's not a rally.
[02:29:19.657 --> 02:29:20.797]  It's a time-lapse.
[02:29:20.797 --> 02:29:22.138]  Look at the length of this line here.
[02:29:22.981 --> 02:29:33.123]  This is not a protest or rally, this is an eight-hour wait from the back of the line to speak to a state employee about unemployment benefits.
[02:29:33.123 --> 02:29:34.503]  About unemployment benefits.
[02:29:34.503 --> 02:29:35.523]  And you're seeing this everywhere.
[02:29:35.523 --> 02:29:42.144]  You're going to take your job, you're going to shut down your business, but don't worry, we've got a government check coming for you.
[02:29:42.144 --> 02:29:43.125]  Except it doesn't show up.
[02:29:43.125 --> 02:29:47.465]  It doesn't show up for the businesses, it doesn't show up for the individuals.
[02:29:47.465 --> 02:29:50.086]  We have Gretchen Whitmer, the
[02:29:51.653 --> 02:29:55.075]  The Queen of Michigan.
[02:29:55.075 --> 02:29:58.636]  And she's confronted by a laid-off health care worker.
[02:29:58.636 --> 02:30:03.379]  How do you have all these hospitals going bankrupt during a pandemic?
[02:30:03.379 --> 02:30:05.900]  Well, government management, right?
[02:30:05.900 --> 02:30:07.080]  That's how you do it.
[02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:09.281]  Or maybe it's not a pandemic.
[02:30:09.281 --> 02:30:18.065]  But certainly, even in a pandemic, if the government is controlling our health care, it can destroy the jobs of health care workers.
[02:30:18.065 --> 02:30:18.886]  So this black man
[02:30:19.929 --> 02:30:24.772]  It looks like he's elderly, at least middle age, maybe a little bit older.
[02:30:24.772 --> 02:30:31.637]  Confronts Governor Whitmer and says, I haven't received any of my benefits yet.
[02:30:31.637 --> 02:30:34.619]  He says, is there any possible way that you could put my name in?
[02:30:34.619 --> 02:30:38.382]  Because people are just kind of getting a busy signal, essentially, if they try to get online.
[02:30:39.113 --> 02:30:42.696]  Or they try to call in, but they can't get in because the things are crashing.
[02:30:42.696 --> 02:30:47.880]  The sites are crashing, the phones are busy, because so many people are trying to get unemployment benefits.
[02:30:47.880 --> 02:30:52.944]  But of course, you know, hey, they don't get counted as being unemployed if they can't get on the roll.
[02:30:52.944 --> 02:30:55.385]  So he goes, can you get my name in?
[02:30:55.385 --> 02:30:56.686]  She said, I'll check on it.
[02:30:56.686 --> 02:30:58.288]  Can I buy you a hot dog?
[02:30:58.288 --> 02:30:59.008]  There you go.
[02:30:59.008 --> 02:31:00.910]  See, that's no problem.
[02:31:00.910 --> 02:31:01.810]  A hot dog.
[02:31:01.810 --> 02:31:04.813]  Feed a man a hot dog and you fed him for, well, one meal.
[02:31:05.782 --> 02:31:09.344]  Let him work for a living and he can feed himself, right?
[02:31:09.344 --> 02:31:10.825]  But no, we're not going to do that.
[02:31:10.825 --> 02:31:11.445]  Not going to do that.
[02:31:11.445 --> 02:31:14.587]  That's not what America is about anymore.
[02:31:14.587 --> 02:31:18.929]  Meanwhile, you've got Americans skipping millions of loan payments.
[02:31:18.929 --> 02:31:25.113]  Reports of Wall Street Journal, largest increase in skipped payments occurred for student loans.
[02:31:25.113 --> 02:31:30.036]  79 million student loan accounts are in deferment or other relief status at the end of May.
[02:31:32.385 --> 02:31:39.732]  Americans have skipped payments on more than 100 million student loans, auto loans, and other forms of debt since the coronavirus hit the U.S.
[02:31:39.732 --> 02:31:45.376]  And when we look at what is happening, this so-called relief for small businesses, it is a balloon note.
[02:31:45.376 --> 02:31:49.260]  You know, they can give you a loan unless they forgive it.
[02:31:50.558 --> 02:31:51.078]  Completely.
[02:31:51.078 --> 02:31:53.339]  You're not going to be able to pay it back.
[02:31:53.339 --> 02:32:00.481]  I mean, you're going to be... Where are you going to get the money to pay for your current expenses plus catch up on all this stuff?
[02:32:00.481 --> 02:32:09.923]  And the same thing is true about these people who have been given deferment off of being kicked out of their apartments.
[02:32:09.923 --> 02:32:11.644]  Even if the money shows up.
[02:32:11.644 --> 02:32:17.266]  A lot of people are facing eviction because they, again, like this unemployed worker, they haven't been able to get the checks.
[02:32:17.266 --> 02:32:18.566]  Because we're talking about government here.
[02:32:20.197 --> 02:32:31.260]  And even if they are able to get that and get back to work, they may not be able to catch up to this.
[02:32:31.260 --> 02:32:34.401]  Because these are deferments, they're not forgiveness.
[02:32:34.401 --> 02:32:45.084]  Now you can get forgiveness for your business, but that is only if you pay 75% of the money that they give you has to go out in terms of payroll.
[02:32:46.411 --> 02:32:53.996]  That's not the way things are typically set up, and the amazing thing about that is that Steve Mnuchin just decided that he would change those numbers by himself.
[02:32:53.996 --> 02:32:57.638]  It was 50% when it came out of Congress, but he just said, no, it's going to be 75%.
[02:32:57.638 --> 02:33:00.400]  And put that in.
[02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:04.262]  Now they've got, however, a new stimulus package that they're talking about.
[02:33:04.262 --> 02:33:07.764]  The President talked it up during the White House Roundtable, May 18th.
[02:33:07.764 --> 02:33:11.507]  Said, hey, you know, we could cover up to 50% of vacation, up to $4,000 for vacation credit.
[02:33:14.304 --> 02:33:16.925]  Is there any end to this?
[02:33:16.925 --> 02:33:20.385]  Is there any sanity to this?
[02:33:20.385 --> 02:33:29.387]  Conservatives are saying, hey, we're spending more than we did on the Revolutionary, Civil War, World War I, World War II combined on this stimulus.
[02:33:29.387 --> 02:33:33.248]  The entire defense budget is about $650 billion.
[02:33:33.248 --> 02:33:37.249]  We spent several trillion already, and they've gone up to about $10 trillion that they're looking at.
[02:33:37.249 --> 02:33:37.929]  We'll be right back.
[02:33:37.929 --> 02:33:38.329]  Stay with us.
[02:33:44.539 --> 02:33:52.659]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[02:33:54.008 --> 02:33:58.751]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[02:33:58.751 --> 02:34:01.112]  Super Male Vitality!
[02:34:01.112 --> 02:34:09.957]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[02:34:09.957 --> 02:34:20.824]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[02:34:21.104 --> 02:34:21.785]  Yes.
[02:34:21.785 --> 02:34:26.710]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[02:34:26.710 --> 02:34:33.616]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[02:34:33.616 --> 02:34:34.677]  What are you waiting for?
[02:34:34.677 --> 02:34:36.539]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[02:34:36.539 --> 02:34:39.342]  Never been a better time than right now.
[02:34:39.342 --> 02:34:42.845]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com
[02:34:43.786 --> 02:34:47.809]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System.
[02:34:47.809 --> 02:34:49.391]  The first of its kind.
[02:34:49.391 --> 02:34:54.354]  Pure, nascent, atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray bottle.
[02:34:54.354 --> 02:34:57.377]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here.
[02:34:57.377 --> 02:35:00.479]  Introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[02:35:00.479 --> 02:35:03.582]  The great part about the X2 Spray is it's great on the go.
[02:35:03.582 --> 02:35:06.084]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house.
[02:35:06.604 --> 02:35:09.045]  You know, great at work, but this is great for the car.
[02:35:09.045 --> 02:35:10.846]  It's great to keep with you.
[02:35:10.846 --> 02:35:17.130]  And, again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[02:35:17.130 --> 02:35:18.671]  We're really excited about it.
[02:35:18.671 --> 02:35:20.812]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[02:35:20.812 --> 02:35:32.319]  It was a listener's idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new and, in some ways, even better way.
[02:35:32.779 --> 02:35:43.177]  Get your Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine Spray now at 33% off at Infowarsstore.com and experience the power of aerosolized X2 Nascent Iodine for yourself!

[02:36:01.412 --> 02:36:02.113]  That's right.

[02:36:17.845 --> 02:36:19.207]  Mmmmm.
[02:36:19.207 --> 02:36:21.791]  I just devoured your cousin in four times.
[02:36:21.791 --> 02:36:22.493]  Protein Bar.
[02:36:33.911 --> 02:36:37.013]  And on top of that, get an unprecedented 70% off our a.m.
[02:36:37.013 --> 02:36:37.393]  p.m.
[02:36:37.393 --> 02:36:39.354]  day and night 8-pack Power Stack.
[02:36:39.354 --> 02:36:44.998]  Our original Mega Flash specials have ended, but our new D-Specials have launched at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:36:44.998 --> 02:36:49.181]  We were told by the United Nations, we were told by the CDC and Fauci
[02:36:49.901 --> 02:36:56.970]  That two plus million Americans would die, that millions of Europeans would die if we did not do exactly as they said.
[02:36:56.970 --> 02:36:58.952]  And it turned out it was all fraud.
[02:36:58.952 --> 02:37:05.901]  The models, the testing, taking regular deaths and putting it in the COVID-19 column, all a complete criminal fraud.
[02:37:06.101 --> 02:37:07.841]  But none of them are getting sued.
[02:37:07.841 --> 02:37:09.542]  None of them are getting prosecuted.
[02:37:09.542 --> 02:37:11.762]  None of them are getting in trouble, except for Bill Gates.
[02:37:11.762 --> 02:37:17.884]  The FDA shut down his factories that are making fake COVID tests that show everyone as positive.
[02:37:17.884 --> 02:37:26.646]  And despite that, they're still testing record numbers of people, creating hysteria and saying the number's spiking and why it'll be 200,000 dead by the election.
[02:37:26.646 --> 02:37:28.587]  And it's all Trump's fault.
[02:37:28.587 --> 02:37:31.407]  And now, oh, China had 40 cases in one city.
[02:37:31.407 --> 02:37:32.848]  We've got a lockdown again.
[02:37:32.848 --> 02:37:33.668]  Everything's over.
[02:37:34.168 --> 02:37:38.033]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the new order teaching us to be total prisoners.
[02:37:38.033 --> 02:37:42.038]  Either we expose the COVID hoax, or we're all permanently enslaved by it.
[02:37:42.038 --> 02:37:47.605]  Your choice.
[02:37:47.605 --> 02:37:50.229]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:38:24.443 --> 02:38:33.729]  For the story up on Infowars.com, protesters in Portland topple a statue of George Washington and set it on fire.
[02:38:33.729 --> 02:38:35.349]  I'll show the video clip of that.
[02:38:35.349 --> 02:38:37.431]  You can see the statues.
[02:38:37.431 --> 02:38:42.574]  They're now destroying them physically, pulling them down, destroying them, and chemically destroying them.
[02:38:42.574 --> 02:38:43.114]  Look at that.
[02:38:43.114 --> 02:38:45.275]  That is just disgusting.
[02:38:45.275 --> 02:38:46.596]  But that's Portland.
[02:38:46.596 --> 02:38:47.216]  That is Portland.
[02:38:47.216 --> 02:38:48.217]  That's exactly what they do.
[02:38:48.217 --> 02:38:50.959]  But it's not just located, not just limited of course,
[02:38:51.852 --> 02:39:01.899]  So what is happening in Portland, in Seattle, in Minneapolis, you know, Chazestan, East and West?
[02:39:01.899 --> 02:39:03.820]  No, it's worldwide.
[02:39:03.820 --> 02:39:13.407]  As I pointed out last week on my program in the morning, I said the Antifa flag goes back to the 1930s in Germany.
[02:39:13.407 --> 02:39:14.928]  And I showed a picture of it from the 1930s.
[02:39:14.928 --> 02:39:20.472]  I talked about Mark Hall, who I've interviewed a number of times, did a great documentary
[02:39:21.831 --> 02:39:30.636]  called Killing Ed talks about the worst case example of charter schools and that is the Fatala Gulen schools that are affiliated here.
[02:39:30.636 --> 02:39:31.836]  There's the picture.
[02:39:31.836 --> 02:39:33.237]  And you can see that flag.
[02:39:33.237 --> 02:39:34.738]  It hasn't changed a bit.
[02:39:34.738 --> 02:39:35.738]  It's funny.
[02:39:35.738 --> 02:39:39.901]  You know, these Marxists, they still have the same approach.
[02:39:39.901 --> 02:39:43.643]  You know, it's the red flag that follows right there behind the black flag.
[02:39:43.643 --> 02:39:48.105]  The black flag of anarchy and then comes the Marxism right behind it.
[02:39:49.927 --> 02:40:03.733]  And as he was pointing out to me, when I talked to him, he said he'd lived a number of years in Germany, right after the wall fell, right after they took down the plexiglass wall.
[02:40:03.733 --> 02:40:05.573]  It wasn't plexiglass there.
[02:40:05.573 --> 02:40:08.175]  But don't worry, the concrete wall is coming for us as well.
[02:40:08.175 --> 02:40:13.097]  If we don't stop this plexiglass wall, you better be able to see through what's coming.
[02:40:13.097 --> 02:40:14.477]  But he pointed out that
[02:40:17.310 --> 02:40:21.112]  That Antifa was very active as they came over from East Germany.
[02:40:21.112 --> 02:40:23.873]  And that it really was a Marxist movement.
[02:40:23.873 --> 02:40:25.314]  There always has been.
[02:40:25.314 --> 02:40:30.096]  And that is a part of this global movement.
[02:40:30.096 --> 02:40:36.839]  You know, we talk about the toxic social media and about the propaganda press.
[02:40:36.839 --> 02:40:40.241]  I think the most amazing thing that I've seen in the last three months is how
[02:40:41.201 --> 02:40:45.544]  With complete control over the levers of information.
[02:40:45.544 --> 02:40:50.087]  With just a few corporations controlling the internet and social media.
[02:40:50.087 --> 02:40:55.170]  Another handful, you know, three or four corporations controlling the internet and social media.
[02:40:55.170 --> 02:41:00.373]  Another three or four corporations controlling everything that you see, both in terms of news and entertainment.
[02:41:00.373 --> 02:41:03.235]  They have been able to, in the course of just three months,
[02:41:04.428 --> 02:41:11.312]  Pushed through two, not one, but two global narratives to control the population.
[02:41:11.312 --> 02:41:13.053]  In rapid succession.
[02:41:13.053 --> 02:41:14.494]  And we're not done yet.
[02:41:14.494 --> 02:41:16.935]  They're coming for another wave of it.
[02:41:16.935 --> 02:41:25.500]  And when you look at these monuments across the country, I mean, they're coming after Robert the Bruce in Scotland.
[02:41:25.500 --> 02:41:27.962]  Putting slogans, racist king and so forth.
[02:41:27.962 --> 02:41:29.623]  He never saw a black man.
[02:41:30.871 --> 02:41:33.973]  At the time he was living in Scotland.
[02:41:33.973 --> 02:41:37.394]  They're coming after Mahatma Gandhi in the UK.
[02:41:37.394 --> 02:41:40.716]  Article we have at Infowarsstore.com a couple of days ago.
[02:41:40.716 --> 02:41:48.520]  London Mayor Khan is setting up a commission to review all landmarks to ensure they comply with diversity.
[02:41:48.520 --> 02:41:54.563]  Now political correctness has taken that level from Comrade Sadiq Khan.
[02:41:54.563 --> 02:41:59.546]  Why do they bring in these people like Sadiq Khan and Sundar Pichai?
[02:42:00.851 --> 02:42:02.691]  To control our society.
[02:42:02.691 --> 02:42:03.432]  Oh, I think you know.
[02:42:03.432 --> 02:42:04.492]  That's a rhetorical question.
[02:42:04.492 --> 02:42:06.432]  You do know, don't you?
[02:42:06.432 --> 02:42:07.712]  You got the London police now.
[02:42:07.712 --> 02:42:15.274]  They don't have a problem with Black Lives Matter and tearing down monuments, just like they don't in other places in the United States.
[02:42:15.274 --> 02:42:25.836]  But if you have people who show up to protect the monuments, to keep things from being destroyed, keep things from being burned down, then the police have a problem with those people.
[02:42:25.836 --> 02:42:28.397]  Just as we saw in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[02:42:30.427 --> 02:42:32.168]  I think that was where the incident happened.
[02:42:32.168 --> 02:42:35.350]  You had people show up to protect statues there.
[02:42:35.350 --> 02:42:43.454]  They were threatened with people who had weapons, knives and so forth, but they were open carrying guns and, you know, of course they come after the guys who are protecting the monuments.
[02:42:43.454 --> 02:42:52.639]  That's what they're doing in the UK as well, coming after Tommy Robinson and his agitators, as the Metropolitan Police put it.
[02:42:52.639 --> 02:42:57.202]  Macron, on the other hand, is not going to allow statues to be removed.
[02:42:58.106 --> 02:43:07.411]  He says, yes, we will have a discussion about colonialism and the different aspects of that, but we're not going to let you destroy our history.
[02:43:07.411 --> 02:43:16.455]  And there's an article on Zero Hedge by Jonathan Turley, A Tale of Two Cities, London and Paris.
[02:43:16.455 --> 02:43:20.437]  And you know, it's kind of gone exactly the opposite direction now, right?
[02:43:20.437 --> 02:43:27.581]  The time that Dickens did The Tale of Two Cities, it was Paris, of course, that was in the throes of a socialist revolution.
[02:43:28.619 --> 02:43:32.963]  And where everything was being ripped down and torn up, but now it's just the opposite.
[02:43:32.963 --> 02:43:38.928]  As Macron is saying, you know, you've got to destroy history, you're not going to destroy monuments, public art.
[02:43:38.928 --> 02:43:43.131]  The response in London and Paris, writes Trilley, is strikingly different.
[02:43:43.131 --> 02:43:47.055]  In this tale of two cities, it's London that seems to be surrendering to the hysteria of the moment.
[02:43:48.356 --> 02:43:52.859]  Protesters often faced no intervention in London as they defaced public art.
[02:43:52.859 --> 02:44:00.104]  Later, London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced that he would yield to demands to take down statues of imperialist figures.
[02:44:00.104 --> 02:44:03.947]  That he would create a commission to review and improve diversity.
[02:44:03.947 --> 02:44:11.072]  He said he no longer wanted to see statues and road names and public spaces reflect a bygone era.
[02:44:11.072 --> 02:44:13.554]  This is what this was always about.
[02:44:13.554 --> 02:44:16.696]  It was not only people replacement, but culture replacement.
[02:44:16.696 --> 02:44:17.937]  Everything must be replaced.
[02:44:19.175 --> 02:44:23.156]  By the New Barbarians.
[02:44:23.156 --> 02:44:26.597]  As Jonathan Turley points out, it's a history night walking around London.
[02:44:26.597 --> 02:44:32.879]  It's an overwhelming and inspiring experience to see the response of Sadiq Khan to its destruction.
[02:44:32.879 --> 02:44:36.220]  And his plans to remove historical monuments is terribly distressing.
[02:44:36.220 --> 02:44:42.241]  It's one of the reasons why Nigel Farage said, these people are like the Taliban.
[02:44:42.241 --> 02:44:48.563]  It was a spot-on comment and it was so spot-on that they immediately removed him from his broadcasting situation.
[02:44:50.046 --> 02:44:53.709]  Which is a confirmation of what he's talking about.
[02:44:53.709 --> 02:44:56.671]  Meanwhile in Paris, the response has been very different.
[02:44:56.671 --> 02:45:05.377]  French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to stand with history to resist efforts to down statues of controversial or colonial era figures.
[02:45:05.377 --> 02:45:10.320]  He said the Republic will not erase any trace or any name from its history.
[02:45:10.320 --> 02:45:12.622]  It will not take down any statue.
[02:45:12.622 --> 02:45:17.865]  We should look at all of our history together with lucidity.
[02:45:17.865 --> 02:45:18.186]  That's right.
[02:45:19.158 --> 02:45:20.078]  You look at what is good.
[02:45:20.078 --> 02:45:21.959]  You look at what is bad.
[02:45:21.959 --> 02:45:23.699]  You debate.
[02:45:23.699 --> 02:45:26.800]  But these people just want to destroy.
[02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:27.480]  So there you have it.
[02:45:27.480 --> 02:45:28.960]  Two cities.
[02:45:28.960 --> 02:45:33.881]  One, a profile in courage, as Charles Dickens wrote at the beginning of his novel.
[02:45:33.881 --> 02:45:36.962]  Charlie quotes there, it was the best of times, the worst of times.
[02:45:36.962 --> 02:45:41.423]  The age of wisdom and the age of foolishness.
[02:45:41.423 --> 02:45:42.463]  The epic of belief.
[02:45:43.291 --> 02:45:45.832]  And the epic of incredulity.
[02:45:45.832 --> 02:45:55.076]  It was a season of light, it was a season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, and it was the winter of despair.
[02:45:55.076 --> 02:46:01.158]  And so, as we look at what is coming for us, we understand that they understand.
[02:46:01.158 --> 02:46:03.479]  The time is ripe.
[02:46:03.479 --> 02:46:07.601]  They have chosen a period in history that they knew
[02:46:09.039 --> 02:46:16.426]  The population was ready for a change and they are going to manipulate the levers of that change to their advantage.
[02:46:16.426 --> 02:46:25.214]  And the next step in this is going to be the re-imposition of even more controls.
[02:46:25.214 --> 02:46:29.959]  And the only way they get away with this is if you allow them to do this.
[02:46:31.701 --> 02:46:36.745]  As I pointed out, Neil Howe, one of the guys who, Straus and Howe, wrote the book, Fourth Turning.
[02:46:36.745 --> 02:46:39.948]  They're the ones who took a generational view of history.
[02:46:39.948 --> 02:46:43.351]  We talk about Millennials, they coined that term.
[02:46:43.351 --> 02:46:52.458]  They said in the early 90s, sometime around mid-2000s, there's going to be a major worldwide economic event, but about 15 years before it happened.
[02:46:52.458 --> 02:46:54.680]  Sure enough, we had the Great Recession.
[02:46:54.680 --> 02:46:56.902]  They said that will set off a trigger, a turning.
[02:46:59.457 --> 02:47:04.500]  Society will be reorganized like it typically is about every 80 years.
[02:47:04.500 --> 02:47:10.542]  It's usually accompanied by massive economic distress and usually by war.
[02:47:10.542 --> 02:47:12.903]  The previous fourth turning was the Great Depression, World War II.
[02:47:12.903 --> 02:47:14.043]  Before that, the Civil War.
[02:47:14.043 --> 02:47:15.744]  Before that, the Revolutionary War.
[02:47:15.744 --> 02:47:24.508]  And they went back and showed a pattern of history about every 80 years, going back 500 years in American and British history.
[02:47:24.508 --> 02:47:25.368]  Pretty well documented.
[02:47:26.345 --> 02:47:29.928]  And it's not just Straus and Howe, as a matter of fact.
[02:47:29.928 --> 02:47:37.555]  There's a guy who, ten years ago, predicted that 2020 would be the beginning of a civil war.
[02:47:37.555 --> 02:47:44.421]  A decade ago, Peter Turchin predicted that 2020 would be mayhem, including widespread civil unrest.
[02:47:46.176 --> 02:47:58.164]  He teaches cultural evolution at the University of Connecticut, and in 2010 he predicted in the scholarly journal Nature that America would, quote, suffer a period of major societal upheaval starting about the year 2020.
[02:47:58.164 --> 02:48:00.946]  They had no reason to believe I wasn't crazy.
[02:48:00.946 --> 02:48:04.569]  He said people didn't understand I wasn't making scientific predictions.
[02:48:04.569 --> 02:48:07.311]  I was making scientific predictions and not prophecies.
[02:48:09.522 --> 02:48:16.509]  As a scientist, I feel vindicated, but on the other hand, I'm an American, and I have to live through these hard times.
[02:48:16.509 --> 02:48:18.171]  Well, you do too.
[02:48:18.171 --> 02:48:29.361]  And folks, if you want to keep us here on air, and if you want to prepare for your own survival, we now have storable food at the shortest length that we've had at infowarsstore.com.

[02:48:33.547 --> 02:48:36.789]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism.
[02:48:36.789 --> 02:48:41.852]  And so, populist movements are throwing the globalists out of their countries.
[02:48:41.852 --> 02:48:52.779]  That's why the New World Order is instituting race war and division and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying essential services.
[02:48:53.559 --> 02:49:02.001]  This is an attempt to have society collapse, and the globalists, as they've done in the third world, will come in and pick up the pieces.
[02:49:02.001 --> 02:49:08.602]  We must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU, openly saying, defund the police.
[02:49:08.602 --> 02:49:09.903]  The police have a lot of problems.
[02:49:09.903 --> 02:49:11.263]  We all have a lot of problems.
[02:49:11.263 --> 02:49:14.023]  But this is our government and our local constabulary.
[02:49:14.023 --> 02:49:16.104]  And believe me, once the globalists have overthrown this country,
[02:49:16.977 --> 02:49:20.998]  They're going to put in a real police state where you have no due process or freedom.
[02:49:20.998 --> 02:49:24.760]  The globalists believe Communist China is the model of the world.
[02:49:24.760 --> 02:49:26.941]  And they are orchestrating this entire thing.
[02:49:26.941 --> 02:49:31.402]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed.
[02:49:31.402 --> 02:49:32.423]  InfoWars.com
[02:49:34.468 --> 02:49:36.509]  The globalists want us domesticated.
[02:49:36.509 --> 02:49:42.613]  They want us inside our homes, watching our televisions, and being controlled by our, quote, smartphones.
[02:49:42.613 --> 02:49:43.834]  Everybody knows this.
[02:49:43.834 --> 02:49:45.054]  It's their admitted goal.
[02:49:45.054 --> 02:49:54.180]  We've had whistleblowers from Facebook, Twitter, and Google go public and say, at the highest levels, their job is to make you neurotic, destroy your mind, and take over your life.
[02:49:54.680 --> 02:49:57.402]  And now the COVID hysteria is all about that.
[02:49:57.402 --> 02:50:07.989]  I recently had a woman in the street while I was with my youngest daughter and my daughter walked close to her and she said, get away six feet and gave her a super ugly look.
[02:50:07.989 --> 02:50:10.571]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is mental illness.
[02:50:10.571 --> 02:50:13.973]  My daughter walking four feet from some old woman is not a crime.
[02:50:13.973 --> 02:50:17.656]  The old woman's mental illness is the crime if we get into it.
[02:50:18.496 --> 02:50:21.859]  This is total and complete mind control.
[02:50:21.859 --> 02:50:25.042]  We must expose the COVID hoax now.
[02:50:25.042 --> 02:50:27.143]  They're going to continue to clamp down using this.
[02:50:27.143 --> 02:50:28.925]  It's a UN Bill Gates plan.
[02:50:28.925 --> 02:50:32.488]  They've been proven to be criminal liars and they must be defeated.
[02:50:32.488 --> 02:50:37.112]  They must be exposed.
[02:50:37.112 --> 02:50:39.754]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:49.427 --> 02:50:53.270]  News, analysis, reports.
[02:50:53.270 --> 02:50:56.211]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:56.211 --> 02:51:00.094]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[02:51:00.094 --> 02:51:00.554]  Welcome back.
[02:51:00.554 --> 02:51:05.678]  I was just talking about the predictions ten years ago in the journal Nature by Peter Turchin.
[02:51:14.758 --> 02:51:21.344]  He said, I'm not making prophecies, I'm just doing scientific predictions.
[02:51:21.344 --> 02:51:24.787]  And he said, there are a lot of signs that we're going to have a lot of upheaval in this decade.
[02:51:24.787 --> 02:51:28.930]  Declining wages, wealth inequality, exploding national debt.
[02:51:28.930 --> 02:51:32.053]  And of course, we're going to have Nick Begich taking over.
[02:51:32.053 --> 02:51:39.940]  I'm going to throw to him, and before I do, real quickly, I just got to say, you know, when you look at what is happening here, and Nick, you know, we're looking at
[02:51:41.400 --> 02:51:45.422]  Ten trillion dollars that is being proposed?
[02:51:45.422 --> 02:52:00.169]  We were freaking out, and rightfully so, I think, to see that the cumulative debt from the beginning of America until a couple of years ago under President Obama was twenty trillion dollars, and now we're about to increase that by fifty percent in just a matter of months.
[02:52:00.169 --> 02:52:09.694]  We've got a hundred billion dollars being thrown out for a program to track people, another hundred billion dollars proposed to throw out for rental relief and so forth, another hundred billion dollar program
[02:52:10.054 --> 02:52:12.956]  Well, you know, the number is over 130,000 per family of four.
[02:52:29.847 --> 02:52:30.067]  Yeah.
[02:52:42.256 --> 02:52:50.159]  Things come home to roost and you're hearing, you know, China's making noise again about, hey, we don't want to suck up any more of these.
[02:52:50.159 --> 02:52:57.901]  And these dollars and you're hearing from the oil producers that used to suck up a lot of those, you know, they're less inclined.
[02:52:57.901 --> 02:53:00.582]  And so somewhere these dollars have to end up.
[02:53:00.582 --> 02:53:02.543]  And eventually you end up with inflation.
[02:53:02.543 --> 02:53:07.404]  You know, this is the same scenario of the 1930s Europe.
[02:53:07.404 --> 02:53:08.005]  Right.
[02:53:08.005 --> 02:53:09.165]  It's so parallel.
[02:53:09.165 --> 02:53:10.365]  In fact, there's an old book.
[02:53:10.365 --> 02:53:11.606]  It's been out of print forever.
[02:53:12.186 --> 02:53:13.587]  It's absolutely mind-blowing to look at the
[02:53:28.817 --> 02:53:31.398]  Astronomical sums of money that are being thrown out there.
[02:53:31.398 --> 02:53:41.981]  I mean, you know, we talk about the bloated defense budget, that's 650 billion dollars, and yet, you know, they're throwing out two or three trillion dollars every couple of months, and it just can't keep going forever.
[02:53:41.981 --> 02:53:43.462]  I mean, we're going to lose
[02:53:44.202 --> 02:53:46.403]  We're going to, like you said, we're going to go into hyperinflation.
[02:53:46.403 --> 02:53:49.483]  We're going to lose the dollar as a reserve currency.
[02:53:49.483 --> 02:53:54.565]  Even if that were to happen somewhere, if that were not to happen, then we're going to have to all pay that back.
[02:53:54.565 --> 02:54:03.187]  And as you pointed out, the amount per family that's there, everybody's looking at, hey, I've got to check for a vacation now on top of my other stuff, but you're going to have to pay that back.
[02:54:04.344 --> 02:54:08.305]  Right, and that's a family of four just in what they're dumping in $10 trillion.
[02:54:08.305 --> 02:54:17.647]  I mean, that doesn't include existing national debt or the Social Security obligations or any of that, which some say is more like $60 trillion or $65 trillion.
[02:54:17.647 --> 02:54:20.688]  And we're throwing... This is insanity.
[02:54:20.688 --> 02:54:27.289]  It is total, absolute... It violates all the rules of economics, as you and I know, and it eventually catches up.
[02:54:27.289 --> 02:54:31.310]  And it's easy for politicians to please everyone until
[02:54:32.452 --> 02:54:37.455]  Until, as my second grade teacher used to say, until you have a rude awakening.
[02:54:37.455 --> 02:54:40.396]  That's right.
[02:54:40.396 --> 02:54:46.660]  We're going to have the moment where the music stops and we're all going to be looking for where our chair is, you know, this musical chairs game.
[02:54:46.660 --> 02:54:54.224]  Like I say, it's kind of like the Wile E. Coyote moment, you know, where you are able to run off the cliff and you can go for a while until you realize that there's no
[02:54:54.244 --> 02:55:11.395]  There's nothing beneath you, and once we have that realization as a society, and once that settles in globally, then at that point, the dollar is in freefall, and we're going to be going right down to the bottom of the canyon with a 16-ton anvil following us.
[02:55:11.395 --> 02:55:13.637]  Yeah, choking us all the way down.
[02:55:13.637 --> 02:55:14.598]  That's right.
[02:55:14.598 --> 02:55:16.699]  It's crazy, and it is where we're at.
[02:55:16.699 --> 02:55:17.560]  We're going to take a break.
[02:55:17.560 --> 02:55:22.583]  I'm turning it over to Nick Begich, earthpulse.com, and stay with us.
[02:55:22.583 --> 02:55:23.904]  He'll be right back in just a minute.
[02:55:42.802 --> 02:55:43.822]  It's finally here!
[02:55:43.822 --> 02:55:48.664]  Introducing the first-of-its-kind nascent iodine spray with true atomic iodine.
[02:55:48.664 --> 02:55:55.287]  Lister's have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep-earth crystal nascent iodine.
[02:55:55.287 --> 02:55:57.328]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[02:55:57.328 --> 02:56:06.131]  Our proprietary new Aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[02:56:06.411 --> 02:56:12.916]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power of truthnascent iodine working for my body.
[02:56:12.916 --> 02:56:14.497]  I can personally feel the difference.
[02:56:14.497 --> 02:56:22.383]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[02:56:22.603 --> 02:56:27.428]  Iodine may also support your body and healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[02:56:27.428 --> 02:56:32.452]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of true nascent iodine today.
[02:56:32.452 --> 02:56:39.919]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 spray for 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com before we sell out of our new limited first shipment.
[02:56:39.919 --> 02:56:41.421]  That's InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:56:48.237 --> 02:56:54.699]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:56:54.699 --> 02:57:01.722]  And now your host, Nick Vagich.
[02:57:01.722 --> 02:57:03.042]  And welcome back.
[02:57:03.042 --> 02:57:12.826]  It's so good to be here on this Friday afternoon in most of the world, still Friday morning here in Anchorage, Alaska, headed in to noon at the end of the hour.
[02:57:12.826 --> 02:57:16.527]  You know, what a week again, you know,
[02:57:20.060 --> 02:57:20.461]  We're good.
[02:57:30.311 --> 02:57:39.234]  What I would say about that is all the money that's in the pipeline and a lot of it is stuck somewhere, as was earlier reported, that will loosen up.
[02:57:39.234 --> 02:57:40.714]  That will change.
[02:57:40.714 --> 02:57:49.277]  But then eventually, you know, the music stops and they've loaded us all onto the Titanic and we're playing musical chairs on a sinking ship.
[02:57:49.277 --> 02:57:49.697]  It's really
[02:57:50.457 --> 02:57:53.721]  The best equation in terms of the economy.
[02:57:53.721 --> 02:57:56.204]  So you need to be thinking about that.
[02:57:56.204 --> 02:58:00.689]  Do what you individually can about that and continue.
[02:58:02.051 --> 02:58:16.297]  To be prudent with your cash, I'd say this also, you know, having my experience here in Alaska with national banks and state banks and credit unions, what I've discovered in the last several months, we discovered it during the earthquake a few years back.
[02:58:16.297 --> 02:58:25.501]  We had the seven point something earthquake up here and the banks closed except for, you know, state banks and local credit unions.
[02:58:25.501 --> 02:58:27.422]  And I would suggest to every listener,
[02:58:28.334 --> 02:58:33.338]  To move your money out of national banks into local banks that are accessible to you.
[02:58:33.338 --> 02:58:34.539]  Look at your credit unions.
[02:58:34.539 --> 02:58:36.020]  Look at who has accessible hours.
[02:58:36.020 --> 02:58:38.622]  My credit union in Anchorage is open on Sunday.
[02:58:38.622 --> 02:58:39.943]  Kind of convenient.
[02:58:39.943 --> 02:58:45.627]  So think about getting your money a little closer to home and out of the big banksters hands.
[02:58:45.627 --> 02:58:47.388]  That would be a good idea.
[02:58:47.388 --> 02:58:48.629]  I recommend it highly.
[02:58:48.629 --> 02:58:54.914]  Here in Alaska particularly because a lot of the big banks have said they will not invest in the Arctic anymore.
[02:58:55.538 --> 02:59:00.000]  In other words, they will not invest in America anymore because we're 20% of the landmass.
[02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:03.841]  We're the biggest natural resource base left.
[02:59:03.841 --> 02:59:07.723]  And the big banks who got bailed out a few times, I want to get bailed out again.
[02:59:07.723 --> 02:59:09.343]  There's, you know, this is it.
[02:59:09.343 --> 02:59:10.384]  This is discrimination.
[02:59:10.384 --> 02:59:22.288]  You know, when you look at our congressional delegation, Sullivan, Murkowski and Young of all, you know, screaming about this because, hey, a lot of federal money goes here.
[02:59:22.288 --> 02:59:24.729]  A lot of state money goes into these big banks.
[02:59:25.470 --> 02:59:28.792]  And they won't bank on our future?
[02:59:28.792 --> 02:59:31.294]  Time to tell the globalists to take a hike.
[02:59:31.294 --> 02:59:33.975]  But today's agenda, I want to shift around a bit.
[02:59:33.975 --> 02:59:41.040]  I want to get back to one of my topics of the past that we've not dealt a lot with.
[02:59:41.040 --> 02:59:46.623]  And it's the World Wide Web as it relates to the World Wide Mind.
[02:59:46.623 --> 02:59:47.464]  I want to say that again.
[02:59:47.464 --> 02:59:53.147]  The World Wide Web as it relates to the World Wide Mind.
[02:59:53.147 --> 02:59:53.968]  And what am I talking about?
[02:59:55.077 --> 03:00:01.602]  There was a PBS special a number of years ago, you can look it up, and it was called The Worldwide Mind.
[03:00:01.602 --> 03:00:05.925]  And it was a prediction that was going out decades from where we are even today.
[03:00:05.925 --> 03:00:23.477]  But it was a number of years ago, and they were suggesting that at some point, instead of an internet where we can dial in or dial out, you know, what would be available is something that you just were in, where they just could kind of look inside
[03:00:24.524 --> 03:00:29.728]  Uh, and literally connect the minds of the planet up.
[03:00:29.728 --> 03:00:33.011]  That is a profound thought, if you think about it.
[03:00:33.011 --> 03:00:38.155]  The integrated brains in a politically correct culture.
[03:00:38.155 --> 03:00:39.236]  Now think about that.
[03:00:39.236 --> 03:00:51.285]  You know, in the last couple hours, we've been hearing about, you know, screening and segregating what can be said and how it can be said and when it can be said or if it can be said at all.
[03:00:51.963 --> 03:00:53.024]  You know, controlling speech.
[03:00:53.024 --> 03:01:02.109]  So I want to I want to talk about this in a broader context today and I want to go back to some of my work on the mind control issue.
[03:01:02.109 --> 03:01:09.433]  Controlling the Human Mind is the book in the video only and exclusively in hard copies available from InfoWars store.
[03:01:10.200 --> 03:01:11.541]  And so you can get those there.
[03:01:11.541 --> 03:01:15.422]  And the electronic versions are available at earthpulse.com.
[03:01:15.422 --> 03:01:17.703]  There's links to get those.
[03:01:17.703 --> 03:01:21.365]  Take a look at earthpulse.com and sign up for my newsletter.
[03:01:21.365 --> 03:01:22.045]  It's free.
[03:01:22.045 --> 03:01:25.427]  I'm kicking out the first one in years in the next week.
[03:01:25.427 --> 03:01:30.609]  So get on the list at earthpulse.com for the free newsletter.
[03:01:30.609 --> 03:01:32.670]  Integrated brains and political correctness.
[03:01:32.670 --> 03:01:33.951]  Think about this.
[03:01:33.951 --> 03:01:39.493]  If in fact this comes to be that they can link every brain on the planet
[03:01:41.054 --> 03:01:44.416]  That is a whole other ballgame now, isn't it?
[03:01:44.416 --> 03:02:05.224]  One of the things that we predicted over 20 years ago, we would reach a stage where you could literally download, dump information, bypassing the subconscious directly into the brain, bypassing even the conscious and embedding it there in such a deep way that it was literally programming.
[03:02:05.224 --> 03:02:06.385]  Now the question becomes,
[03:02:07.296 --> 03:02:13.202]  In compulsory education in K-12, who controls the curriculum?
[03:02:13.202 --> 03:02:13.762]  Right?
[03:02:13.762 --> 03:02:15.664]  The programming, if you will.
[03:02:15.664 --> 03:02:25.433]  I joke about it with my friends, you know, because I feel like with my granddaughter who I'm raising, Aurora, I'm the chief programmer.
[03:02:25.433 --> 03:02:25.954]  You see?
[03:02:25.954 --> 03:02:27.255]  That's what parents do.
[03:02:28.032 --> 03:02:39.377]  Not the government and not some esoteric weird connection that some moron thinks is a good idea, linking the brains of the world together in some artificial way.
[03:02:39.377 --> 03:02:47.240]  Because what I'll also weave into this conversation is the reality that the best in quantum physics tells us that we're already
[03:02:47.933 --> 03:02:53.220]  Connect in this fundamental way, whether we recognize it or not.
[03:02:53.220 --> 03:02:54.842]  And we'll get into that a little bit.
[03:02:54.842 --> 03:02:57.826]  But I want to talk about digital privacy.
[03:02:57.826 --> 03:03:02.311]  I got I got notes today because I really want to make sure I hit the high points.
[03:03:02.311 --> 03:03:05.215]  Digital privacy moves from gathering data.
[03:03:06.716 --> 03:03:07.717]  I'm just collecting it.
[03:03:07.717 --> 03:03:08.758]  Think about this.
[03:03:08.758 --> 03:03:14.922]  I wrote about this years ago when we were talking about data valence and the collection of data and how that would be stored.
[03:03:14.922 --> 03:03:23.528]  Everybody was laughing back then, 25 years ago, because people said, oh, no worries, you know, they'll never be able to sort that data.
[03:03:23.528 --> 03:03:24.149]  Well, guess what?
[03:03:25.225 --> 03:03:27.166]  Yes, they can.
[03:03:27.166 --> 03:03:30.968]  Commercially and governmentally, they can sort all that data now and they do.
[03:03:30.968 --> 03:03:40.034]  It's part of the profiling programming that goes on through organizations like the Cambridge Analytica.
[03:03:40.034 --> 03:03:47.218]  It is what the whole Age of Surveillance Capitalism, which is a great book, is all about.
[03:03:47.218 --> 03:03:48.318]  And that's what that's about.
[03:03:48.318 --> 03:03:49.619]  It's really well documented.
[03:03:49.619 --> 03:03:52.581]  And this one is a really great one targeted
[03:03:53.941 --> 03:03:57.162]  This one is about Cambridge Analytica.
[03:03:57.162 --> 03:04:06.905]  And Cambridge Analytica actually influenced over 60, I believe it was 60 governments' elections before they kind of got buried under some other corporate names.
[03:04:06.905 --> 03:04:08.025]  But big data.
[03:04:08.025 --> 03:04:10.886]  So we knew about that, but now we're shaping it differently.
[03:04:10.886 --> 03:04:16.848]  Now it's not just about getting it from all the places you look and search and collecting your data.
[03:04:16.848 --> 03:04:17.468]  It's about
[03:04:18.200 --> 03:04:21.061]  Going inside and extracting the data.
[03:04:21.061 --> 03:04:22.081]  Now, how close are we?
[03:04:22.081 --> 03:04:26.162]  We're getting closer every year and I call it digital resolution.
[03:04:26.162 --> 03:04:31.443]  You know, the pixels, you know, how tight it gets and how clear the image is.
[03:04:31.443 --> 03:04:33.923]  Resolution, think about it that way too.
[03:04:33.923 --> 03:04:43.625]  As the science advances, programming speeds increase and when we cross the threshold and some say we have to quantum computing, now it's all penetratable.
[03:04:45.022 --> 03:05:04.803]  And then think about this, if you understand the signaling well enough, now you can reverse that, you see, because now you can create the same kind of signaling that's receptive and can be received by the brain and you can send it in.
[03:05:05.558 --> 03:05:14.808]  And so discernment in terms of how information comes and goes will become a big deal in the coming years and decades.
[03:05:14.808 --> 03:05:21.416]  And where we are right now, some will say we have the technology already and perhaps we do.
[03:05:21.416 --> 03:05:23.398]  But here's here's where this goes.
[03:05:24.597 --> 03:05:30.124]  This is the very violation of who we are fundamentally as human beings and it's the artificial system.
[03:05:30.124 --> 03:05:35.151]  Think about this as the materialistic version of reality creation.
[03:05:35.151 --> 03:05:41.740]  People who just think we're flesh and bones and this is how we have our 80 years if we're lucky and poof we check out we're dead we're dust.
[03:05:42.220 --> 03:05:50.265]  And then there's the other school of thought that says we're a soul occupying a body and has spiritual dimension over here on this side of the equation.
[03:05:50.265 --> 03:05:55.448]  And in the middle of the two are something no one can see or touch.
[03:05:55.448 --> 03:05:57.329]  It's human thought and human emotion.
[03:05:58.283 --> 03:06:02.249]  And when you connect the two, this is a powerful thing.
[03:06:02.249 --> 03:06:15.807]  You see, this is when the left and right brain come together, the heart and mind flow into each other, the material subordinate to the spiritual, and you do what you were created to do as someone created in the image and likeness of God.
[03:06:16.427 --> 03:06:25.434]  The other is an illusion, an abstraction, an engagement without power, but an intrusion into the very essence of our soul.
[03:06:25.434 --> 03:06:26.915]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:06:26.915 --> 03:06:29.938]  You're the tip of the spear, and this is the InfoWars.
[03:06:29.938 --> 03:06:32.279]  We'll be right back after these brief messages.
[03:06:32.279 --> 03:06:34.241]  Pay attention, support this network.
[03:06:34.241 --> 03:06:37.123]  That's how we change the world together.
[03:06:37.123 --> 03:06:38.324]  Nick Begich, and we'll be right back.
[03:06:40.714 --> 03:06:48.225]  One of our best-selling products is Living Defense, and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[03:06:48.225 --> 03:06:54.414]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast, and I want those of you that haven't experienced Living Defense to get it for yourself.
[03:06:54.414 --> 03:06:55.856]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[03:06:55.956 --> 03:06:55.976]  I
[03:07:12.759 --> 03:07:17.482]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years.
[03:07:17.482 --> 03:07:19.363]  And the doctors, they tried every test.
[03:07:19.363 --> 03:07:20.864]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[03:07:20.864 --> 03:07:24.846]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[03:07:24.846 --> 03:07:27.027]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[03:07:27.027 --> 03:07:30.049]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that stuff.
[03:07:30.049 --> 03:07:31.930]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[03:07:31.930 --> 03:07:32.470]  I got it.
[03:07:32.470 --> 03:07:33.691]  I hid it from the nurses.
[03:07:33.691 --> 03:07:34.732]  I started taking it.
[03:07:34.732 --> 03:07:36.793]  Man, that stuff changed my life.
[03:07:36.793 --> 03:07:37.713]  It saved my life.
[03:07:37.713 --> 03:07:40.435]  Alex Jones and InfoWars saved my life.
[03:07:44.099 --> 03:08:00.993]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:00.993 --> 03:08:03.114]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:03.114 --> 03:08:05.056]  Because there is a war on.
[03:08:05.056 --> 03:08:06.677]  For your mind.
[03:08:06.677 --> 03:08:08.579]  With Nick Begich.
[03:08:14.435 --> 03:08:23.278]  All right, and please take a look at earthpulse.com, E-A-R-T-H-P-U-L-S-E, earthpulse.com, and sign up for our free newsletter there.
[03:08:23.278 --> 03:08:25.478]  We really appreciate that.
[03:08:25.478 --> 03:08:28.659]  All of the segments that I've done on InfoWars are linked there.
[03:08:28.659 --> 03:08:38.242]  There's a link into a band.videos, so it's important people go there if you're interested in past programming, and connect the links to band.video.
[03:08:38.242 --> 03:08:43.244]  That's how people know about what everyone is doing within the network, and there's a lot of work going on.
[03:08:44.665 --> 03:09:04.601]  I want to, before the break, I was talking about the, you know, kind of the two different sides to the equation, you know, the fleshy materialistic view of the world versus an energetic spiritual view of the world, and then the mediary being the thought and mind of human beings coupled with emotions.
[03:09:04.601 --> 03:09:08.384]  And I've talked about this before a lot, because the emotional side,
[03:09:09.241 --> 03:09:14.184]  The power and this is what the left right now is hijacking.
[03:09:14.184 --> 03:09:19.827]  You see, they're trying to get the emotion and then they control the thought.
[03:09:19.827 --> 03:09:21.168]  You see the messaging.
[03:09:22.006 --> 03:09:26.209]  The theme that's held in the consciousness then of everyone.
[03:09:26.209 --> 03:09:31.013]  When you link a thought with an emotion, you have power.
[03:09:31.013 --> 03:09:37.157]  You see, but they're mixing it with a dark energy, with anger and violence and hatred.
[03:09:37.157 --> 03:09:38.258]  This is evil.
[03:09:38.258 --> 03:09:43.942]  You see, this is how evil's power manifests in the earth on the fundamental basis.
[03:09:43.942 --> 03:09:45.824]  This is wrong fundamentally.
[03:09:46.610 --> 03:09:58.992]  You see, this is the misuse of what we are as created human beings by denial of what we are at our essence, which is not black, white, yellow, red, pink, or green.
[03:09:58.992 --> 03:10:07.274]  It is humanity at our full soul, spirit, filling a human vessel.
[03:10:07.274 --> 03:10:07.894]  That's it.
[03:10:07.894 --> 03:10:10.155]  This is just a human vessel, a carrier.
[03:10:10.155 --> 03:10:12.175]  It has little meaning.
[03:10:13.451 --> 03:10:21.957]  Okay, it's just a reflection of something deeper, all right, that comes out in the oddball looks, shapes that we all are.
[03:10:21.957 --> 03:10:24.498]  And that's it, really, that really is it.
[03:10:24.498 --> 03:10:30.042]  And so what you miss this and you think you're in you're lost in the physical or the flesh of it.
[03:10:30.042 --> 03:10:38.668]  I can see why the desperation and wanting to know what everyone else thinks actually wanted to control that because they're desperate folks or they're fearful they're living in a total
[03:10:39.443 --> 03:10:40.685]  We're good to go.
[03:10:57.245 --> 03:11:02.627]  To it, and that's what I've talked to in past programs and characterized as passing the baton.
[03:11:02.627 --> 03:11:05.768]  But I want to get it more in a concrete way today also.
[03:11:05.768 --> 03:11:07.129]  So I want to get back into this.
[03:11:07.129 --> 03:11:14.732]  So the mission is to get you emotionalized, coordinate the thought, and then create action, which is the essence of reality creation.
[03:11:15.547 --> 03:11:20.831]  And then there's some overlays here, and I want to talk about them, and the ones that have been mentioned before.
[03:11:20.831 --> 03:11:23.393]  And I'm just going to list four of them really quickly.
[03:11:23.393 --> 03:11:30.559]  Physical biometrics, digital individual metrics, individual financial data, and health data.
[03:11:30.559 --> 03:11:32.580]  Those four to start with, okay?
[03:11:32.580 --> 03:11:33.741]  Physical biometrics.
[03:11:33.741 --> 03:11:34.242]  What is that?
[03:11:34.242 --> 03:11:37.984]  That's your fingerprint, your iris scan, your facial recognition.
[03:11:37.984 --> 03:11:40.646]  All that's being collected by commercial agencies.
[03:11:40.646 --> 03:11:45.130]  You're giving it up on Facebook every day, or any other way the data can be collected.
[03:11:45.490 --> 03:11:48.852]  In India, they did it on everybody, over a billion people.
[03:11:48.852 --> 03:12:00.217]  Facial scans, iris and fingerprints, some couldn't give them because their fingerprints were worn off or their eyes are gouged out or they're blind or what have you, you know, but there were three layers of biometrics.
[03:12:00.217 --> 03:12:05.819]  Then you have social scoring, which kind of goes along with the individual, digital individual.
[03:12:05.819 --> 03:12:09.621]  So you got physical biometrics, you know, physical characteristics on your body.
[03:12:10.265 --> 03:12:11.747]  Digital individual metrics.
[03:12:11.747 --> 03:12:15.991]  That's about all the interactions you have that are digitized throughout the world.
[03:12:15.991 --> 03:12:26.421]  All of your searches, all of your inquiries, all your bank transactions, everything that you can imagine that's in a computer somewhere that someone can steal or extract or give up.
[03:12:26.954 --> 03:12:28.035]  Or collect.
[03:12:28.035 --> 03:12:31.957]  Or the rules change and now it all belongs to somebody else, okay?
[03:12:31.957 --> 03:12:32.937]  Not you.
[03:12:32.937 --> 03:12:48.666]  So this is why I believe that, again, your data, your individual data, should be expunged from all files, and that you can't give it up for commercial purposes or governmental uses, and that after the commercial usefulness of it goes out, which is the time to dispute a credit card charge, poof!
[03:12:48.666 --> 03:12:50.047]  It's gone.
[03:12:50.047 --> 03:12:51.948]  People don't own your data and they can't sell it.
[03:12:51.948 --> 03:12:55.070]  It should be illegal, and you shouldn't be able to give up your right
[03:12:55.859 --> 03:13:02.163]  Privacy any more than, say, give up your right to freedom, you know, become your own, you know, sell yourself into the slave market.
[03:13:02.163 --> 03:13:03.024]  Can't do that.
[03:13:03.024 --> 03:13:04.865]  You can't give up your freedom of speech.
[03:13:04.865 --> 03:13:06.486]  You can't give up your freedom of assembly.
[03:13:06.486 --> 03:13:09.248]  You can't give up your right to religion.
[03:13:09.248 --> 03:13:12.811]  You can't give up any of these rights because they're not yours to give up.
[03:13:12.811 --> 03:13:15.373]  You see, they're embedded in who we are.
[03:13:15.373 --> 03:13:22.918]  So anyone who asks you to check the box, they're the criminal, you see, and their box needs to be checked differently.
[03:13:26.834 --> 03:13:26.974]  Yes.
[03:13:44.049 --> 03:13:49.898]  Um, there's spirituality, you know, and they didn't deny it in the way that we do.
[03:13:49.898 --> 03:13:52.722]  But those that do would like us all to be on the same boat.
[03:13:52.722 --> 03:13:56.307]  That is not where most human beings reside at all.
[03:13:56.307 --> 03:13:56.348]  So
[03:13:58.010 --> 03:14:00.731]  The next piece, individual financial debt.
[03:14:00.731 --> 03:14:01.591]  Well, that's easy.
[03:14:01.591 --> 03:14:04.452]  You know, you're in the system, you know, you're dialing it up.
[03:14:04.452 --> 03:14:05.512]  Now, they want to change a lot.
[03:14:05.512 --> 03:14:07.633]  I'm going to get into that in a few minutes.
[03:14:07.633 --> 03:14:18.776]  And then health debt, of course, that might be very important for regulating, you know, whether you get insurance or not and how much it might cost and when you might retire, whether someone even wants to hire you, you know, if that were available to people.
[03:14:19.853 --> 03:14:25.596]  Um, so there's data is important in the 21st century in a way that has never been.
[03:14:25.596 --> 03:14:34.400]  To kick in a doorway in 1776, British were doing, kicking in your doorway, invading your personal privacy.
[03:14:34.400 --> 03:14:37.002]  It's a different world today.
[03:14:37.002 --> 03:14:40.303]  Now your digital doorway is kicked in every minute.
[03:14:40.303 --> 03:14:41.324]  No one even blinks.
[03:14:42.213 --> 03:14:58.249]  No one even pulls out the pistol to shoot the intruder, which I would never recommend unless it was a physical intrusion in your house and you felt your life was threatened and you were immediate danger of harm and other standards under the law for pulling the trigger in your home.
[03:14:58.249 --> 03:15:03.595]  But the point of the matter is, it is not protected.
[03:15:03.595 --> 03:15:05.637]  Our digital space is not protected.
[03:15:06.596 --> 03:15:17.682]  And this is our government's job to make sure that our digital space is not only protected, it's layered up, that they don't violate it or any commercial interest violates our digital walls.
[03:15:17.682 --> 03:15:20.524]  They don't rape us in the night digitally.
[03:15:20.524 --> 03:15:21.584]  It shouldn't be allowed.
[03:15:21.584 --> 03:15:22.645]  That's what's going on.
[03:15:22.645 --> 03:15:33.691]  It's a digital raping of who you are and eventually they want to dive straight into your awareness and see if you're politically correct enough for the modern age.
[03:15:35.575 --> 03:15:37.356]  And who sets that standard?
[03:15:37.356 --> 03:15:39.256]  This is a very dangerous time.
[03:15:39.256 --> 03:15:44.779]  You know, it's one that I've been talking about for over 25 years, 30 years now.
[03:15:44.779 --> 03:15:46.559]  And we're here now.
[03:15:46.559 --> 03:15:52.282]  We're in that moment now, ladies and gentlemen, where who we are, we need to remember.
[03:15:52.282 --> 03:15:53.582]  See, it's not about evolution.
[03:15:53.582 --> 03:15:55.723]  I've said this many times.
[03:15:55.723 --> 03:15:57.003]  We are what we are.
[03:15:57.003 --> 03:15:58.584]  We were created to be what we are.
[03:15:58.584 --> 03:16:03.366]  We just need to remember and begin to act as best we individually can
[03:16:04.273 --> 03:16:14.041]  In this general direction, knowing that there's others doing the same, being prepared to pass the baton to those that take on the faith that you leave behind.
[03:16:14.041 --> 03:16:15.943]  That's how it works, you see.
[03:16:15.943 --> 03:16:19.786]  Because the internet, the worldwide mind already exists.
[03:16:19.786 --> 03:16:21.768]  It's what it all is.
[03:16:21.768 --> 03:16:24.009]  It is what we are.
[03:16:24.009 --> 03:16:28.273]  When the phrase says, created in the image and likeness of God,
[03:16:29.292 --> 03:16:33.318]  It connects us to something much bigger than we are, to all of us.
[03:16:33.318 --> 03:16:34.180]  This is Nick Begich.
[03:16:34.180 --> 03:16:36.303]  We'll be right back after these brief messages.
[03:16:36.303 --> 03:16:37.866]  And you are the tip of the spear.
[03:16:38.956 --> 03:16:41.417]  I was talking to my Patriots supplier, Great Suppliers.
[03:16:41.417 --> 03:16:46.839]  You can now say four weeks on average for storable food, it's the highest quality, they've got it.
[03:16:46.839 --> 03:16:53.242]  Use this little rest we have, caught in the current, to come up to the surface, get some air, before you get sucked back down.
[03:16:53.242 --> 03:16:55.763]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[03:16:55.763 --> 03:16:59.124]  I have to now start going into defense posture.
[03:16:59.124 --> 03:17:03.946]  80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense, trying to fully, you know, stop the Globeless.
[03:17:03.946 --> 03:17:07.288]  And we've given them a good run, and I think down the road they'll be defeated, but
[03:17:08.527 --> 03:17:11.289]  We're gonna still go down the hard road now.
[03:17:11.289 --> 03:17:17.192]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still gonna be bad in my view.
[03:17:17.192 --> 03:17:18.693]  You need to get high-quality, storable food.
[03:17:18.693 --> 03:17:19.893]  It's something you need.
[03:17:19.893 --> 03:17:30.919]  We have high-quality ready to get out to you, and it supports the broadcast and 360Win, so please take care of your storable food needs at infowarstore.com and get your orders in now, so you get it, so you have it.

[03:17:33.721 --> 03:17:37.723]  Get it while you can, because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen nothing yet.

[03:18:34.497 --> 03:18:39.238]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:18:39.238 --> 03:18:45.540]  David Rockefeller and other satanic pieces of garbage who thought they'd set up their world government.
[03:18:46.561 --> 03:18:52.365]  I believe they pulled the drain on America a long time ago.
[03:18:52.365 --> 03:19:06.374]  But if we understand that they've orchestrated this by design, and if there's a mass awakening, it can be their unraveling, their destruction, and them going down the drain.
[03:19:06.374 --> 03:19:11.418]  The Bible tells us that many times when the enemy digs a pit for us, they themselves fall into it.
[03:19:11.418 --> 03:19:15.561]  But God is the master of the universe, but gives us free will on this planet as a test.
[03:19:16.741 --> 03:19:23.204]  It is up to us to decide whether we're going down the drain or whether the globalists are going down the drain.
[03:19:23.204 --> 03:19:28.026]  I cannot express to listeners and viewers of this broadcast how important you are.
[03:19:28.026 --> 03:19:29.867]  Everything hinges on you.
[03:19:29.867 --> 03:19:30.807]  Everything.
[03:19:30.807 --> 03:19:31.848]  Peacefully.
[03:19:31.848 --> 03:19:34.729]  Become the Paul Revere you know you've always been.
[03:19:34.729 --> 03:19:41.612]  God bless and good luck.
[03:19:41.612 --> 03:19:44.254]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:57.596 --> 03:20:04.809]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Nick Vagic.
[03:20:04.809 --> 03:20:07.554]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:10.973 --> 03:20:22.862]  Hey, I just want to say I so appreciate everyone on the team, you know, in Austin and that make this possible and all of you that participate in the network by supporting InfoWars.
[03:20:22.862 --> 03:20:28.746]  And I just want to encourage you go to the InfoWarsStore.com, get on board, do some things.
[03:20:28.746 --> 03:20:31.408]  I contribute my time every week as a sub host because
[03:20:33.370 --> 03:20:39.943]  You know, and we need your engagement because there's things that people can do and there's always things we can do.
[03:20:42.228 --> 03:20:44.350]  Join us in at least those ways.
[03:20:44.350 --> 03:20:47.912]  Get on the newsletter at earthpulse.com and get on board.
[03:20:47.912 --> 03:20:51.835]  But I want to get back into the subject because I got the whole show pretty much today.
[03:20:51.835 --> 03:20:54.657]  And I want to talk about where are we headed?
[03:20:54.657 --> 03:21:01.142]  You know, in the backdrop of this concept of manipulating human behavior, there's lots of levels to this.
[03:21:01.142 --> 03:21:06.606]  The book Controlling the Human Mind gets into the details with over 250 sources.
[03:21:06.606 --> 03:21:07.347]  And this was now
[03:21:08.948 --> 03:21:15.532]  It's a couple decades old of research, okay, because what we've done is phenomenal.
[03:21:15.532 --> 03:21:25.838]  Take a look at this subject and you'll find stuff that's being produced by the globalists around the world talking about using this way of sort of
[03:21:26.761 --> 03:21:35.747]  Altered reality, connected to AI, connected to the internet, an interpretation of what goes on in the brain for education and for monitoring.
[03:21:35.747 --> 03:21:36.467]  It's real.
[03:21:36.467 --> 03:21:37.268]  Go look it up.
[03:21:37.268 --> 03:21:39.069]  You'll see all the stuff.
[03:21:39.069 --> 03:21:39.909]  We predicted it.
[03:21:39.909 --> 03:21:40.790]  It's here now.
[03:21:40.790 --> 03:21:46.994]  Okay, but so is the counterbalance to all of this, which is the fact that we already have all that.
[03:21:46.994 --> 03:21:48.034]  We just got to remember.
[03:21:48.034 --> 03:21:49.795]  So that's part of the mission is to remember.
[03:21:49.795 --> 03:21:50.576]  But I want to give
[03:21:51.156 --> 03:21:52.397]  What's going on?
[03:21:52.397 --> 03:22:00.164]  Okay, I talked a little bit about social scoring in the past and that's what China's doing, gathers all those data bits, all those bits of information.
[03:22:00.164 --> 03:22:01.585]  They get all of it, right?
[03:22:01.585 --> 03:22:09.733]  And then what they do is decide whether you have a job, whether your kids get an education, whether you get a passport, etc, etc, etc.
[03:22:09.733 --> 03:22:10.994]  This is what the commercial
[03:22:11.992 --> 03:22:15.714]  Side of this matrix does on the West.
[03:22:15.714 --> 03:22:25.299]  You see, they use commercial entities, global entities to collect data in exactly the same way private companies BS.
[03:22:25.299 --> 03:22:33.643]  Ladies and gentlemen, these are the airwaves of the public airwaves and they've been hijacked by these people who are making money on our data.
[03:22:33.643 --> 03:22:35.223]  This is a hijacking.
[03:22:35.223 --> 03:22:36.404]  This is a staff
[03:22:37.176 --> 03:22:42.243]  of the public airwaves and a filtering of the public discourse.
[03:22:54.338 --> 03:22:56.679]  Feedback and extraction of data.
[03:22:56.679 --> 03:23:03.241]  You know, focus groups, polling, collecting your data, like Cambridge Analytical and their successors.
[03:23:03.241 --> 03:23:09.462]  Collecting it like the CIA and the NSA and every security agency in the world to manipulate you.
[03:23:09.462 --> 03:23:21.246]  And then collecting other data through guys like Epstein to blackmail politicians to run the world, to recruit them in colleges, even as early as high school now, headed into college for these dark activities.
[03:23:21.246 --> 03:23:22.106]  Get them involved in
[03:23:22.566 --> 03:23:28.148]  Elicit sex and perversion so you can blackmail them later and then help them get to the top.
[03:23:28.148 --> 03:23:29.888]  Where they can be run and owned.
[03:23:29.888 --> 03:23:32.849]  And too many of them are there right now.
[03:23:32.849 --> 03:23:34.510]  Right now.
[03:23:34.510 --> 03:23:35.770]  Why did Trump get elected?
[03:23:35.770 --> 03:23:37.091]  Everybody knew his sins.
[03:23:37.091 --> 03:23:40.912]  They were published on the front page of the newspapers before he was elected.
[03:23:40.912 --> 03:23:42.452]  You know what?
[03:23:42.452 --> 03:23:44.773]  First one without sin casts the first stone.
[03:23:44.773 --> 03:23:46.553]  You know, that's where I'm at on that.
[03:23:46.553 --> 03:23:48.194]  We're all in that boat together.
[03:23:48.979 --> 03:23:51.780]  But the next thing is controlled speech, number two.
[03:23:51.780 --> 03:23:53.901]  What's going on with the Infowars?
[03:23:53.901 --> 03:23:56.382]  What's going on with other people's platforms right now?
[03:23:56.382 --> 03:23:59.884]  That's step two in manipulating the world and taking over.
[03:23:59.884 --> 03:24:06.887]  The third is control alternative free media.
[03:24:06.887 --> 03:24:07.947]  Right?
[03:24:07.947 --> 03:24:15.591]  Think about some of the big networks that have consolidated, bought out the competition, shut up their voice, buy them out, pay them money.
[03:24:16.451 --> 03:24:19.413]  You know, sad tale, but that's what's happening.
[03:24:19.413 --> 03:24:26.459]  It's not free speech, it's because it costs somebody money to buy all that speech.
[03:24:26.459 --> 03:24:30.042]  I'm saying that facetiously, but that's really what it is, isn't it?
[03:24:30.042 --> 03:24:35.707]  They're just buying their way to free speech so they can have it all and it's no longer free.
[03:24:35.707 --> 03:24:38.008]  So the third step, control alternative, free press.
[03:24:38.008 --> 03:24:38.569]  And the fourth,
[03:24:39.272 --> 03:24:40.974]  Digital voting, no hard paper.
[03:24:40.974 --> 03:24:43.116]  This is a real hijacking.
[03:24:43.116 --> 03:24:45.198]  Never, never, ever, ever.
[03:24:45.198 --> 03:24:47.420]  They already have absentee processes.
[03:24:47.420 --> 03:24:53.946]  You get an application, you fill it out, they verify things, they send you a ballot with a number, you know?
[03:24:54.406 --> 03:24:56.827]  Okay, we already have all that in the country.
[03:24:56.827 --> 03:24:59.288]  That's called mail-in absentee balloting.
[03:24:59.288 --> 03:25:10.054]  It's meant for people serving in the military overseas, for elderly that can't get out of their elder care homes, for a lot of people that aren't in a position to go to the polls.
[03:25:10.054 --> 03:25:11.834]  That's the right way to do it.
[03:25:11.834 --> 03:25:13.375]  But it's a paper ballot.
[03:25:13.375 --> 03:25:15.156]  It should always be a paper ballot.
[03:25:16.418 --> 03:25:17.579]  Never, ever, ever.
[03:25:17.579 --> 03:25:19.919]  Some things should never be automated.
[03:25:19.919 --> 03:25:21.200]  The paper ballot is one of them.
[03:25:21.200 --> 03:25:26.502]  We ought to all be able to go back and grab that, match it up to our stub with a number.
[03:25:26.502 --> 03:25:30.123]  And not hanging chads with a little ink mark.
[03:25:30.123 --> 03:25:31.043]  An ink mark.
[03:25:31.043 --> 03:25:34.065]  You see something real, tangible.
[03:25:34.065 --> 03:25:36.065]  So you can't lose number four, digital voting.
[03:25:36.065 --> 03:25:36.786]  Forget that.
[03:25:36.786 --> 03:25:37.826]  It's got to be hard paper.
[03:25:38.616 --> 03:25:40.358]  Transition number five.
[03:25:40.358 --> 03:25:41.759]  Transition to electronic money.
[03:25:41.759 --> 03:25:42.800]  Elimination of cash.
[03:25:42.800 --> 03:25:43.881]  You've heard about it before.
[03:25:43.881 --> 03:25:46.404]  The UN has been pushing for it.
[03:25:46.404 --> 03:25:54.732]  The World Health Organization, because of the filthy lucre of passing viruses around the planet with money, is their excuse.
[03:25:54.732 --> 03:26:01.098]  And then you had the Congress, the Democrats, try to push this through on one of these appropriation bills for the helicopter money.
[03:26:01.098 --> 03:26:01.899]  Digital money
[03:26:03.189 --> 03:26:06.171]  Is slavery, ladies and gentlemen, this is the end of it.
[03:26:06.171 --> 03:26:11.333]  This is where everything you do has got to be politically correct, even what you spend your money on.
[03:26:11.333 --> 03:26:14.314]  And who's going to decide that?
[03:26:14.314 --> 03:26:15.855]  That's a big deal, folks.
[03:26:15.855 --> 03:26:20.317]  Electronic money is one of the five pillars of destruction that I've listed so far.
[03:26:20.317 --> 03:26:21.118]  Don't accept that.
[03:26:21.118 --> 03:26:27.141]  The sixth pillar of destruction, travel restrictions and significant cost inflation.
[03:26:27.141 --> 03:26:28.561]  Oh, my goodness.
[03:26:28.561 --> 03:26:29.982]  Have we seen a bit of that lately?
[03:26:30.720 --> 03:26:39.226]  And we are going to see inflation and airfares is going to go off the charts because keep these airlines going with one person on the plane, the tickets are going to get up there, right?
[03:26:39.226 --> 03:26:40.907]  Because you're not going to subsidize them forever.
[03:26:40.907 --> 03:26:44.009]  Now, there'll be some great bankruptcy sales for airlines.
[03:26:44.009 --> 03:26:46.791]  And so you'd be bailing aircraft out for a few cents on the dollar.
[03:26:46.791 --> 03:26:48.473]  You reorganize those things.
[03:26:48.473 --> 03:26:51.995]  They all get a clean slate and the money disappears into the void.
[03:26:51.995 --> 03:26:57.539]  And somebody else owns that airlines and maybe it stabilizes, but transportation.
[03:26:58.365 --> 03:26:59.745]  Your ability to travel.
[03:26:59.745 --> 03:27:07.027]  I can't get from my state to your state because I got Canada in the middle and they closed their borders.
[03:27:07.027 --> 03:27:07.967]  And they closed them again.
[03:27:07.967 --> 03:27:09.987]  They just extended until July 21st.
[03:27:09.987 --> 03:27:15.809]  I can't even drive out of town to get to the rest of my country.
[03:27:15.809 --> 03:27:17.569]  That's where we're at in Alaska right now.
[03:27:17.569 --> 03:27:22.650]  A lot of people don't know that because you don't live in Alaska.
[03:27:22.650 --> 03:27:27.371]  And we've had 12 deaths, which is 12 deaths, which is a lot for any family.
[03:27:28.058 --> 03:27:33.222]  In any small population, but we added 12 here, so far.
[03:27:33.222 --> 03:27:37.725]  But a lot of restrictions, you know, so transportation, you know, now we're getting used to that.
[03:27:37.725 --> 03:27:41.007]  Cost will go up, that'll end up forcing that.
[03:27:41.007 --> 03:27:49.273]  And then here's the thing that I was talking about earlier, is number seven, mind-to-computer interface as the normal brain-to-computer link.
[03:27:49.273 --> 03:27:54.157]  Speeds things up, see, it's convenient, you just have to think it, and it is so, and the machine clicks on and off.
[03:27:54.773 --> 03:27:56.254]  This is where we're headed.
[03:27:56.254 --> 03:28:05.583]  It'll start with simple things, simple things you can do with your thoughts, and then more complex things until the resolution is high enough to get the whole picture.
[03:28:05.583 --> 03:28:06.424]  And this is happening.
[03:28:06.424 --> 03:28:11.108]  These contracts have been let as far back as 2007-2008 by the NSA.
[03:28:11.108 --> 03:28:18.074]  You see postings, you see links to some of this on my website at earthbolts.com.
[03:28:18.074 --> 03:28:18.955]  And then the next one,
[03:28:20.134 --> 03:28:26.078]  Re-education by direct download, where we started earlier in the program, right?
[03:28:26.078 --> 03:28:29.800]  Where you can just plug in and dump it in.
[03:28:29.800 --> 03:28:32.802]  Now that might be interesting for language.
[03:28:32.802 --> 03:28:39.106]  You can start thinking about the context in which sentences might be used, you know, to teach you the language.
[03:28:39.106 --> 03:28:42.968]  Maybe there's a second layer in there in terms of what's programmed in, you know?
[03:28:43.955 --> 03:28:44.836]  Or in science.
[03:28:44.836 --> 03:28:49.458]  Maybe the science story has a lot built around it, you know, as they program it in.
[03:28:49.458 --> 03:28:50.379]  Who knows?
[03:28:50.379 --> 03:28:51.480]  But here's the deal.
[03:28:51.480 --> 03:28:55.122]  This is where we're headed, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:28:55.122 --> 03:28:57.063]  Now think about false memories.
[03:28:57.063 --> 03:28:59.364]  We're programming the whole picture.
[03:28:59.364 --> 03:29:00.345]  And then go to court.
[03:29:00.345 --> 03:29:02.046]  What's going to happen to court testimony?
[03:29:02.046 --> 03:29:06.088]  What's going to happen to what witnesses represent?
[03:29:06.781 --> 03:29:10.144]  You know, there's a lot to think about here, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:29:10.144 --> 03:29:15.489]  Digitizing images, changing the past, changing the future.
[03:29:15.489 --> 03:29:16.930]  It's about that.
[03:29:16.930 --> 03:29:20.413]  The ultimate propaganda war exists right now.
[03:29:20.413 --> 03:29:23.236]  We are in the Info Wars right now.
[03:29:23.236 --> 03:29:29.341]  It has been about Info Wars for the 30 years, 25 years that Alex and I have worked together.
[03:29:29.341 --> 03:29:31.864]  This is Nick Begich, and you're the Tip of the Sphere.
[03:29:38.123 --> 03:29:39.784]  It's finally here!
[03:29:39.784 --> 03:29:43.887]  Introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[03:29:43.887 --> 03:29:50.251]  Available now for 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:29:50.251 --> 03:30:00.477]  Listeners have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive Deep Earth Crystal Nascent Iodine.
[03:30:00.477 --> 03:30:03.719]  Our proprietary new Aerodyne technology
[03:30:04.159 --> 03:30:15.005]  Allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into the ultimate spray formula.
[03:30:15.005 --> 03:30:23.069]  Iodine is an essential mineral that helps support thyroid health, healthy metabolism, and healthy cognitive function.
[03:30:23.769 --> 03:30:31.353]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 Spray for 33% off intro pricing at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:30:31.353 --> 03:30:35.315]  That's Survival Shield X2 Spray at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:30:37.435 --> 03:30:49.426]  We were told by the United Nations, we were told by the CDC and Fauci that two plus million Americans would die, that millions of Europeans would die, that we did not do exactly as they said.
[03:30:49.426 --> 03:30:51.408]  And it turned out it was all fraud.
[03:30:51.408 --> 03:30:58.355]  The models, the testing, taking regular deaths and putting it in the COVID-19 column, all a complete criminal fraud.
[03:30:58.575 --> 03:31:00.296]  But none of them are getting sued.
[03:31:00.296 --> 03:31:01.996]  None of them are getting prosecuted.
[03:31:01.996 --> 03:31:04.217]  None of them are getting in trouble except for Bill Gates.
[03:31:04.217 --> 03:31:10.319]  The FDA shut down his factories that are making fake COVID tests that show everyone as positive.
[03:31:10.319 --> 03:31:19.342]  And despite that, they're still testing record numbers of people, creating hysteria and saying the numbers spiking and why it'll be 200,000 dead by the election.
[03:31:19.342 --> 03:31:21.023]  And it's all Trump's fault.
[03:31:21.023 --> 03:31:23.864]  And now, oh, China had 40 cases in one city.
[03:31:23.864 --> 03:31:25.285]  We've had a lockdown again.
[03:31:25.285 --> 03:31:26.105]  Everything's over.
[03:31:26.625 --> 03:31:30.466]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the new order teaching us to be total prisoners.
[03:31:30.466 --> 03:31:34.486]  Either we expose the COVID hoax, or we're all permanently enslaved by it.
[03:31:34.486 --> 03:31:39.707]  Your choice.
[03:31:39.707 --> 03:31:41.488]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[03:31:41.488 --> 03:31:41.968]  You're on the air.
[03:31:41.968 --> 03:31:42.528]  Thanks for holding.
[03:31:42.528 --> 03:31:42.988]  Hey, hello.
[03:31:42.988 --> 03:31:43.568]  Can you hear me?
[03:31:43.568 --> 03:31:44.208]  I sure can, sir.
[03:31:44.208 --> 03:31:44.648]  Thank you.
[03:31:44.648 --> 03:31:45.268]  Hey, Alex.
[03:31:45.268 --> 03:31:51.509]  Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[03:31:51.509 --> 03:31:52.850]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[03:31:52.850 --> 03:31:54.870]  I'm from New Bern, Connecticut, and
[03:31:55.530 --> 03:31:56.971]  I just want to plug in.
[03:31:56.971 --> 03:32:01.392]  I'm a truck driver and two of the fours have changed the way I drive.
[03:32:01.392 --> 03:32:08.035]  Me and my brothers that drive, a couple of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[03:32:08.035 --> 03:32:15.998]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I've lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank
[03:32:16.138 --> 03:32:16.638]  Thank you for that man.
[03:32:38.553 --> 03:32:46.000]  United Nations is publicly depopulating Africa and many other third world sectors of the world.
[03:32:46.000 --> 03:32:52.586]  Bill and Melinda Gates that control the UNWHO openly say they want to depopulate brown people.
[03:32:52.586 --> 03:33:01.354]  It is absurdist that Apple and Google and Nike have slave factories in China, the worst on the planet, and then elect your white people.
[03:33:01.414 --> 03:33:04.237]  This is a totally sickening, disgusting joke.
[03:33:20.074 --> 03:33:25.437]  But at the heart of them is a eugenics-based depopulation operation.
[03:33:25.437 --> 03:33:32.240]  Why aren't Black Lives Matter at Cold Springs Harbor in New York where they run the whole operation trying to topple statues?
[03:33:32.240 --> 03:33:34.201]  Why aren't they at the United Nations?
[03:33:34.201 --> 03:33:41.605]  Because they're controlled by the UN and being directed by their masters.
[03:33:41.605 --> 03:33:44.247]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:59.541 --> 03:34:05.167]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Nick Baggage!
[03:34:11.371 --> 03:34:17.113]  Thank you so much for being here on this Friday, headed into the afternoon here in Anchorage, Alaska.
[03:34:17.113 --> 03:34:20.735]  And we've been really busy, we're doing a lot of different things.
[03:34:20.735 --> 03:34:27.637]  And at the last part of the segment, I'll talk maybe a little bit about that, because I've clued you in on some of the projects I'm doing here.
[03:34:27.637 --> 03:34:29.078]  But I want to get back to the list.
[03:34:29.078 --> 03:34:34.040]  And I want to read through the list one more time of these major issues that are part of
[03:34:34.600 --> 03:34:37.641]  How do globalists sort of take over in this one?
[03:34:37.641 --> 03:34:44.162]  And I had mentioned one, feedback and extraction of data, collecting information on us.
[03:34:44.162 --> 03:34:51.283]  Next, controlling our individual speech through political correctness and the issues of tolerance where you withhold your truth in some way.
[03:34:51.283 --> 03:34:52.683]  Now, this is wrong.
[03:34:52.683 --> 03:34:54.684]  Tolerance I've spoken about before, too.
[03:34:54.684 --> 03:34:57.104]  I don't believe in tolerance.
[03:34:57.104 --> 03:35:00.545]  I believe in acceptance, which is the deepest level you see.
[03:35:01.357 --> 03:35:10.464]  Because tolerance is self-hatred in a sense, you know, because you're holding your truth, you're keeping your mouth shut and not saying what you believe.
[03:35:10.464 --> 03:35:16.708]  Now, this is really important in terms of how mind control works in a population, in a gross way, in a grand way.
[03:35:16.708 --> 03:35:30.278]  As soon as you start doing that, what happens by denying truth, you see, that's what you're doing, by denying your personal truth, then eventually what happens, you begin repeating what you know is correct to say.
[03:35:30.954 --> 03:35:34.515]  Now you're spreading an untruth knowingly.
[03:35:34.515 --> 03:35:35.435]  And what is it?
[03:35:35.435 --> 03:35:36.015]  What is that?
[03:35:36.015 --> 03:35:37.515]  That's called a lie.
[03:35:37.515 --> 03:35:41.276]  And then you begin to experience your existence through that lie.
[03:35:41.276 --> 03:35:42.736]  This is not right.
[03:35:42.736 --> 03:35:44.016]  Tolerance is wrong.
[03:35:44.016 --> 03:35:44.857]  It's a trick.
[03:35:44.857 --> 03:35:45.937]  It's a trap.
[03:35:45.937 --> 03:35:50.078]  Acceptance is a deeper level.
[03:35:50.078 --> 03:35:52.918]  It's where you meet people where they are.
[03:35:52.918 --> 03:35:55.979]  You accept them where they are.
[03:35:55.979 --> 03:35:58.159]  You know, this is what Christ did.
[03:35:59.247 --> 03:36:00.008]  Okay?
[03:36:00.008 --> 03:36:03.411]  With the whores and the lepers and the destitute.
[03:36:03.411 --> 03:36:05.273]  And then he healed them.
[03:36:05.273 --> 03:36:06.254]  Then he forgave them.
[03:36:06.254 --> 03:36:08.776]  Okay?
[03:36:08.776 --> 03:36:10.958]  And that's who we are, okay?
[03:36:10.958 --> 03:36:14.381]  Supposed to be as human beings, I believe.
[03:36:14.381 --> 03:36:20.707]  That same image and likeness of behavior as well in the material, in the flesh.
[03:36:21.832 --> 03:36:24.935]  Through our spirit acting in our flesh.
[03:36:24.935 --> 03:36:28.898]  You see, it's a deeper level, something globalists cannot understand.
[03:36:28.898 --> 03:36:35.703]  And as you fall into that deeper level of remembering, your power begins to come back.
[03:36:35.703 --> 03:36:49.194]  You begin to have these bits of intuition, these bits of connection, bits of discernment, as you separate and become the soul within the body and you begin to control the actions of the flesh.
[03:36:50.285 --> 03:36:53.447]  And not let the flesh run you.
[03:36:53.447 --> 03:36:56.849]  You see, this is how the programming works.
[03:36:56.849 --> 03:37:06.075]  And what we're being programmed by those living in fear, globalists, if you want to use that term, elitists, want to use that, occultists, if you want to use that.
[03:37:06.075 --> 03:37:14.460]  You can use any number of labels to describe a way of being that is contrary to a way of being.
[03:37:18.969 --> 03:37:20.491]  So what's it about?
[03:37:20.491 --> 03:37:21.192]  The list.
[03:37:21.192 --> 03:37:27.140]  Feedback, extraction of data, control speech, control the alternative, and free press number three.
[03:37:27.140 --> 03:37:28.462]  Four, digital voting.
[03:37:28.462 --> 03:37:29.703]  Don't allow it.
[03:37:29.703 --> 03:37:30.384]  Remember that.
[03:37:30.384 --> 03:37:31.626]  Digital voting.
[03:37:31.626 --> 03:37:33.529]  And then it's about
[03:37:34.241 --> 03:37:36.663]  Transition to electronic money, which we talked about.
[03:37:36.663 --> 03:37:41.506]  Travel restrictions and inflated travel costs was tougher to do.
[03:37:41.506 --> 03:37:45.029]  Or mind-to-computer interface, which we've been talking about a bit.
[03:37:45.029 --> 03:37:49.292]  And then re-education of the population by direct interference with the brain.
[03:37:49.292 --> 03:37:50.192]  And what does that equal?
[03:37:50.192 --> 03:37:52.734]  Number nine, total control.
[03:37:52.734 --> 03:37:52.794]  Now,
[03:37:54.938 --> 03:37:55.939]  What's the defense?
[03:37:55.939 --> 03:38:03.364]  Because that's really the important thing is what I've been talking about over the last several programs over the last several weeks.
[03:38:03.364 --> 03:38:08.927]  It's remembering what we are, recognizing science supports this now.
[03:38:08.927 --> 03:38:10.328]  This is our reality.
[03:38:10.328 --> 03:38:14.591]  So and I've said don't another big lie is you hear it all the time.
[03:38:14.591 --> 03:38:15.772]  Do the impossible.
[03:38:15.772 --> 03:38:16.633]  Do the impossible.
[03:38:16.633 --> 03:38:18.694]  Don't you realize that's an oxymoron?
[03:38:18.694 --> 03:38:23.017]  If you believe something's impossible, how do you expect to ever do it?
[03:38:23.017 --> 03:38:24.658]  You can't do the impossible.
[03:38:25.603 --> 03:38:33.146]  What's impossible for you, maybe, and I think we can all say absolutely, is possible for someone else.
[03:38:33.146 --> 03:38:34.506]  So let's do this.
[03:38:34.506 --> 03:38:37.988]  Let's each do what we know is possible for us.
[03:38:37.988 --> 03:38:40.048]  Do the possible.
[03:38:40.048 --> 03:38:45.530]  And then as we do that, things get done and we awaken to our own potential and power.
[03:38:45.530 --> 03:38:49.632]  Because by taking actions that are out of who we are,
[03:38:50.908 --> 03:38:54.672]  Things get done, you see, and we do it constantly.
[03:38:54.672 --> 03:39:06.763]  And then you can pass the baton in different ways to someone else who's got a different mission, who has a greater level of faith in a different direction, or maybe a smaller level in other directions.
[03:39:06.763 --> 03:39:09.825]  But you know, this is how it all works, you see.
[03:39:09.825 --> 03:39:12.588]  We fall into our own level of knowing.
[03:39:13.527 --> 03:39:14.708]  And doing.
[03:39:14.708 --> 03:39:15.948]  And that unleashes.
[03:39:15.948 --> 03:39:19.309]  And it may be the bus driver, for good sakes.
[03:39:19.309 --> 03:39:20.190]  It will be all of us.
[03:39:20.190 --> 03:39:22.811]  Because remember, it wasn't the CEO.
[03:39:22.811 --> 03:39:24.591]  It's hard for CEOs.
[03:39:24.591 --> 03:39:26.032]  It was a carpenter.
[03:39:26.032 --> 03:39:26.652]  You know?
[03:39:26.652 --> 03:39:28.073]  It could be anybody.
[03:39:28.073 --> 03:39:28.553]  All right, so
[03:39:29.233 --> 03:39:31.194]  That's the encouraging side of all this.
[03:39:31.194 --> 03:39:40.020]  You know, and I want to talk a little bit about a project I've been involved in, and you have the problem, I know, in Austin and every city that's hearing this.
[03:39:40.020 --> 03:39:47.925]  And it's what's being categorized as homelessness, as if that is the cause of a problem or is the identifiable problem.
[03:39:47.925 --> 03:39:53.269]  And we've been trying to redefine that here in my region to what it truly represents.
[03:39:53.269 --> 03:39:53.389]  About 80%
[03:39:55.030 --> 03:39:59.854]  of that population are mentally ill, drug addicted, and alcoholics.
[03:39:59.854 --> 03:40:01.875]  And I believe that's true throughout the country.
[03:40:01.875 --> 03:40:03.937]  It may even be higher percentages.
[03:40:03.937 --> 03:40:09.601]  And so what's happening is a lot of things to try and address this population.
[03:40:09.601 --> 03:40:13.945]  And what I'm suggesting is a tough love approach.
[03:40:13.945 --> 03:40:19.689]  And a couple of number of people have expressed that concern here in my region a couple of years ago.
[03:40:19.689 --> 03:40:21.170]  And we did a video on this.
[03:40:21.170 --> 03:40:24.072]  It's on InfowarBan.videos.
[03:40:24.072 --> 03:40:24.633]  You can see it.
[03:40:25.515 --> 03:40:48.319]  Done in September last year on the homeless issue we set up intervention2020.com to take on this issue in Anchorage and we had a plan and so we tried I tried for a couple years actually get people to look at our plan locally and several did and we sent out a lot of stuff a lot of energy in it and and what we did is we're pushing this narrative that if we solve mental illness
[03:40:52.316 --> 03:40:56.179]  And police forces are not geared for dealing with mentally ill people.
[03:40:56.179 --> 03:40:58.882]  Look what's happening now in all of our cities.
[03:40:58.882 --> 03:41:06.489]  You have this population of mentally ill, drug addicted and alcoholics mixed in with protests and riots.
[03:41:06.489 --> 03:41:08.471]  And this is not a good mix.
[03:41:08.471 --> 03:41:10.913]  You know, folks, this is what we're seeing.
[03:41:10.913 --> 03:41:12.915]  You know, you're all seeing the mix.
[03:41:12.915 --> 03:41:15.317]  OK, criminality needs to be dealt with.
[03:41:15.317 --> 03:41:17.299]  Now, we don't have riots going on in Alaska.
[03:41:17.879 --> 03:41:21.000]  Because that just isn't going to happen here.
[03:41:21.000 --> 03:41:22.981]  It might happen for 15 minutes.
[03:41:22.981 --> 03:41:25.061]  That's about as long as it'll last.
[03:41:25.061 --> 03:41:27.102]  It's not going to happen here.
[03:41:27.102 --> 03:41:34.184]  Our police were greeted, and it was in our paper today, by a parade of 100 people saying thanks.
[03:41:34.184 --> 03:41:35.705]  Just yesterday.
[03:41:35.705 --> 03:41:37.285]  And so take a look.
[03:41:37.285 --> 03:41:39.046]  There's a lot of different ways to handle this.
[03:41:39.046 --> 03:41:40.806]  But here's the thing.
[03:41:40.806 --> 03:41:42.727]  Empowered people are what makes a difference.
[03:41:43.172 --> 03:41:44.654]  And we got involved in an issue.
[03:41:44.654 --> 03:41:46.856]  We put some money and some energy and some effort.
[03:41:46.856 --> 03:41:47.737]  Not for any gain.
[03:41:47.737 --> 03:41:49.698]  No one's running for anything.
[03:41:49.698 --> 03:41:53.162]  And we got it all the way up to the governor of Alaska.
[03:41:53.162 --> 03:41:55.204]  And the governor of Alaska is going to do something.
[03:41:55.204 --> 03:41:58.707]  He's engaging a committee in the next couple of weeks.
[03:41:58.707 --> 03:42:03.652]  And we see action because we've taken an action.
[03:42:03.652 --> 03:42:05.394]  And everyone listening can take an action.
[03:42:05.974 --> 03:42:07.516]  About something you care about.
[03:42:07.516 --> 03:42:14.121]  This is what I was talking about in the activity of faith, acting on what we know to be right and good as individuals.
[03:42:14.121 --> 03:42:15.002]  Whatever the issue is.
[03:42:15.002 --> 03:42:18.085]  It doesn't have to be anything we're talking about today.
[03:42:18.085 --> 03:42:20.006]  But there is something that you care about.
[03:42:20.006 --> 03:42:21.768]  There is something that you're passionate about.
[03:42:22.789 --> 03:42:32.253]  And that passion is where the magic happens, you see, because that's the emotional energy that you can merge into your thoughts of what you know you can do.
[03:42:32.253 --> 03:42:32.654]  Absolutely.
[03:42:32.654 --> 03:42:33.334]  That's called faith.
[03:42:33.334 --> 03:42:35.075]  And you couple those two things together.
[03:42:35.075 --> 03:42:51.962]  This is how the world changes one breath at a time, one step at a time, one person at a time, because the only way the earth and the world changes and anything about it as stewards that we're concerned about is ever going to change is when we recognize first what we are.
[03:42:52.952 --> 03:42:54.973]  We begin to project differently.
[03:42:54.973 --> 03:42:57.134]  Because that is the beginning point.
[03:42:57.134 --> 03:43:01.437]  The beginning of wisdom begins there, you see, is a bit of self-reflection.
[03:43:01.437 --> 03:43:03.258]  So that we can reflect better into the world.
[03:43:03.258 --> 03:43:05.399]  And then you change the world.
[03:43:05.399 --> 03:43:12.644]  And the power of that, and what's possible in that, as we fall into our full remembrance, will be remarkable.
[03:43:12.644 --> 03:43:13.464]  And we're seeing that.
[03:43:13.464 --> 03:43:17.406]  There is a countermeasure to all of the evil in the world.
[03:43:17.406 --> 03:43:20.308]  Be a part of that right now.
[03:43:20.308 --> 03:43:21.769]  Because we have the opportunity.
[03:43:22.426 --> 03:43:28.869]  To connect in a way that's way different and to manifest in the world way differently, each one of us.
[03:43:28.869 --> 03:43:30.610]  But we do it one at a time.
[03:43:30.610 --> 03:43:34.172]  It's recognizing the sovereignty of every individual soul.
[03:43:34.172 --> 03:43:36.853]  This is not a groupthink project, folks.
[03:43:36.853 --> 03:43:40.815]  This is individual committees of one.
[03:43:40.815 --> 03:43:44.257]  Individual committees of one.
[03:43:44.257 --> 03:43:48.619]  Acting right and true in a way that lifts
[03:43:49.662 --> 03:43:51.183]  That encourages.
[03:43:51.183 --> 03:43:53.844]  That's where we change the world fundamentally.
[03:43:53.844 --> 03:43:55.744]  InfoWars is about information.
[03:43:55.744 --> 03:43:59.846]  We've covered a lot of details and the footnotes in the published work.
[03:43:59.846 --> 03:44:05.308]  A lot of stuff for free online on the mind control subject at EarthPulse.com.
[03:44:05.308 --> 03:44:10.850]  But the main message today is you are in the InfoWars.
[03:44:10.850 --> 03:44:14.151]  You are already part of a worldwide mind.
[03:44:14.151 --> 03:44:16.732]  It's the universal mind and we're all connected.
[03:44:17.481 --> 03:44:20.907]  It's what we're created in the image and likeness of.
[03:44:20.907 --> 03:44:22.750]  This has been Dr. Nick Feggish.
[03:44:22.750 --> 03:44:24.694]  This is the InfoWall.
[03:44:24.694 --> 03:44:25.435]  Thanks for being here.
[03:44:28.729 --> 03:44:31.191]  We're already in the latter part of June.
[03:44:31.191 --> 03:44:33.952]  And of course, most of the country's not completely reopened again.
[03:44:33.952 --> 03:44:37.174]  And already, Fauci and the U.N.
[03:44:37.174 --> 03:44:41.537]  Bill and Melinda Gates criminal combine are telling us, don't go to Trump rallies.
[03:44:41.537 --> 03:44:42.418]  Oh, no.
[03:44:42.418 --> 03:44:48.822]  But the very same media that promotes that we shouldn't go to Trump rallies is telling us we should go to the Democrat Party.
[03:44:48.822 --> 03:44:50.123]  Black lives matter.
[03:44:50.123 --> 03:44:51.644]  All white people are evil.
[03:44:51.644 --> 03:44:52.744]  Mind control.
[03:44:52.744 --> 03:44:53.685]  Brainwashing events.
[03:44:54.085 --> 03:44:58.028]  This is the attempted murder of common sense and logic.
[03:44:58.028 --> 03:45:07.674]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to be more politically active than you ever have, because we are going into hardcore United Nations-controlled bondage.
[03:45:07.674 --> 03:45:17.561]  Major police departments like Los Angeles and Albuquerque, New Mexico, are announcing they're going under UN control and turning their, quote, police into community activist organizers.
[03:45:17.561 --> 03:45:19.042]  This is just the beginning.
[03:45:19.042 --> 03:45:22.124]  Everything's going to accelerate now from this point out.
[03:45:22.124 --> 03:45:23.325]  So, it's here.
[03:45:23.325 --> 03:45:23.925]  No more games.
[03:45:24.025 --> 03:45:30.167]  The New World Order has arrived.
[03:45:30.167 --> 03:45:32.787]  The United States is not Communist China.
[03:45:32.787 --> 03:45:35.708]  We don't have 3 million people in concentration camps.
[03:45:35.708 --> 03:45:37.589]  We don't blow up churches.
[03:45:37.589 --> 03:45:40.770]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[03:45:40.770 --> 03:45:46.251]  But all over the news we see the UN, Bill and Melinda Gates, WHO, mainstream corporations,
[03:45:50.219 --> 03:45:57.626]  If Communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people, well then, gee, we've got to do that.
[03:45:57.626 --> 03:46:03.331]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio passed laws saying we'll arrest you if you say Chinese virus.
[03:46:03.331 --> 03:46:06.514]  Well, now Cuomo in New York's calling it the European virus.
[03:46:06.514 --> 03:46:08.236]  These people are out of control.
[03:46:11.380 --> 03:46:12.721]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
