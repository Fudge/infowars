[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  A Monday warrior meet me stride, Today's Tom Sawyer meet me pride.
[00:30.000 --> 00:50.000]  Welcome it's the 19th of June 2020. I'm David Knight your host.
[00:50.000 --> 00:55.000]  Today we've got a lot to talk about. We have a lot of CEOs who are using June
[00:55.000 --> 01:01.000]  teeth to push division and civil war. I think not reconciliation. So we're going to talk about that.
[01:01.000 --> 01:07.000]  We've got a lot to talk about with the Supreme Court decision that hit yesterday afternoon.
[01:07.000 --> 01:14.000]  Absolutely amazing, but not unexpected. As I've been saying, as this thing's been winding its way through the courts.
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.000]  Why is President Trump even doing this? They don't have the authority to make a decision about this.
[01:20.000 --> 01:26.000]  And I'll tell you why later in the program. But Clarence Thomas was spot on.
[01:26.000 --> 01:34.000]  And what he said about this is absolutely astonishing. But as we look at the continual kneeling,
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.000]  we have Klobuchar on Juneteenth decides that she doesn't like Martin Luther King.
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  Martin Luther King said we want to judge people by the content of their character, not by the color of their skin.
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  But Klobuchar wants to take herself out of the veet stakes.
[01:50.000 --> 01:57.000]  The running for vice president says Biden should pick a woman of color because it doesn't matter.
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  Nothing matters more than skin color now. I mean, you know, we are now embracing full racism,
[02:03.000 --> 02:11.000]  which is why Dick Van Dyke is now being condemned over his black face appearance and Mary Poppins.
[02:11.000 --> 02:16.000]  Yeah, okay, this is satire. But you, I had you there for a moment, didn't you?
[02:16.000 --> 02:24.000]  When I first saw it, I thought it was real too. Yeah, it's absolutely a satire site, southinnewsnetwork.net.
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  But folks, we're not that far away from satire.
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000]  You know, Northam has gotten away with it. I mean, you know, Northam really did the black face.
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  It looks like Howard Stern is going to get away with it as well.
[02:37.000 --> 02:43.000]  But in the satire site, southinnewsnetwork, they said Michelle Garage said she was disgusted and horrified.
[02:43.000 --> 02:52.000]  You can't even use excuse that was accepted in the 1960s, as Disney should have had the cultural foresight to realize it would have been offensive.
[02:52.000 --> 03:00.000]  40 years later, you know, when we look at this, and again, why was he in black face just so that we don't get the Twitter mob started.
[03:00.000 --> 03:06.000]  If you go back and look at it, you might realize that he was actually working as a chimney sweep.
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.000]  I guess they're going to shut down the coal mines. They've got another reason to shut down the coal mines.
[03:11.000 --> 03:18.000]  Not only are we all going to die from carbon dioxide from coal plants, but you know all those people who work in the mines,
[03:18.000 --> 03:24.000]  they come out every day in black face. They must be having some kind of a party down there in the coal mines.
[03:24.000 --> 03:27.000]  We've got to stop this right now, that overt racism.
[03:27.000 --> 03:33.000]  These guys who are getting black lung as well as black face down there working in the coal mines, we've got to stop that.
[03:33.000 --> 03:41.000]  Maybe they should start wearing masks. As a matter of fact, Arnold Schwarzenegger is telling everybody you've got to wear masks.
[03:41.000 --> 03:46.000]  It's a political making a political issue you absolute morons.
[03:46.000 --> 03:54.000]  Says the absolute moron. This is not satire. This is just Schwarzenegger being moronic as usual.
[03:54.000 --> 03:58.000]  This would beat the terrible virus. The science is unanimous.
[03:58.000 --> 04:04.000]  If we all wear masks, we slow down the spread. We've got to save the planet.
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.000]  You need to bring back Greta. He just did his tour with Greta.
[04:08.000 --> 04:15.000]  The two of them, they can save the planet, but we're being told this, seriously being told this by Reuters,
[04:15.000 --> 04:20.000]  by all of the propaganda press, formerly known as mainstream media.
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.000]  I don't give them that much respect anymore. They're not mainstream.
[04:24.000 --> 04:31.000]  They're way out of the mainstream of rationality. They're just propaganda press.
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.000]  And they're now saying it may save your life. More US states are mandating masks.
[04:36.000 --> 05:00.000]  We'll talk about that and many other things when we come back. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[05:00.000 --> 05:08.000]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System. The first of its kind, pure, nascent, atomic iodine,
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.000]  that can be delivered through a spray bottle. The next level of innovation of X2 is here,
[05:13.000 --> 05:20.000]  introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray. The great part about the X2 Spray is it's great on the go.
[05:20.000 --> 05:25.000]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house. It's great at work, but this is great for the car.
[05:25.000 --> 05:31.000]  It's great to keep with you. And again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine,
[05:31.000 --> 05:37.000]  not to just ingest it into the stomach. We're really excited about it. It's 33% off out of the gates.
[05:37.000 --> 05:42.000]  It was listeners' idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists
[05:42.000 --> 05:47.000]  and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new
[05:47.000 --> 05:52.000]  and in some ways even better way. Get your Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine spray now
[05:52.000 --> 06:00.000]  at 33% off at infowarstore.com and experience the power of aerosolized X2 nascent iodine for yourself.
[06:23.000 --> 06:28.000]  It's June 19th. Dear our Lord, 2020, I'm David Knight, your host.
[06:28.000 --> 06:34.000]  We're going to take a look at racial issues which, surprise, are on the front page again
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  because today is June 10th and so we're going to talk about what the CEOs are doing.
[06:38.000 --> 06:44.000]  We're also going to talk about the push to enslave people with masks again.
[06:44.000 --> 06:53.000]  We now have Key West is now saying they've extended mandatory masks until June 2021 for another year.
[06:53.000 --> 07:01.000]  Do they have some new science or something? Are they talking to people with crystal balls instead about this?
[07:01.000 --> 07:06.000]  They're going to extend this for another year. It's absolutely insane.
[07:06.000 --> 07:11.000]  But before we get to that, there is another plan that has been working out for a long time
[07:11.000 --> 07:18.000]  and Alex Jones has an update on the plan to push pedophilia. Here's Alex Jones.
[07:18.000 --> 07:31.000]  Alfred Kinsey, B.F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and many others known as the founders of modern psychology and psychiatry
[07:31.000 --> 07:42.000]  were all self-avowed perverts, degenerates, and pedophiles, particularly the first two men that I mentioned.
[07:42.000 --> 07:51.000]  You can go look it up for yourself that they ran major institutions, major institutes,
[07:51.000 --> 08:01.000]  particularly in the case of Kinsey, where they kept children in cages for the first 10 or 15 years of their life,
[08:01.000 --> 08:07.000]  where they did surgeries on children, where they had sex with children, where they did it all.
[08:07.000 --> 08:11.000]  Now, these men are worshiped by Hollywood on the left.
[08:11.000 --> 08:16.000]  Now you understand why Hollywood's obsessed with pedophilia.
[08:16.000 --> 08:21.000]  Now you understand why it's all coming out and why it's in Build that broke it,
[08:21.000 --> 08:25.000]  and Derspiegel and BBC and London Independent, you name it,
[08:25.000 --> 08:32.000]  that for 30-plus years more than 10 children were given to a convicted child rapist
[08:32.000 --> 08:36.000]  and he was paid by the state to take care of them and have sex with them.
[08:36.000 --> 08:39.000]  What was the goal of this Berlin top psychiatrist?
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  Well, it was the same goal of the pedophile cult.
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.000]  He believed, this is in the news, this is admitted, that they were going to create the ultimate family
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.000]  by children being taken from biological nuclear families that he said were bad
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.000]  and given to the pedophiles who could give children the ultimate love of sex.
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.000]  And he believed that sex with small children was loving and would form a new family
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.000]  where generally same-sex groups, man with a boy, woman with a girl,
[09:06.000 --> 09:13.000]  would form these wonderful relationships for the new future of our new LGBT system.
[09:13.000 --> 09:17.000]  And so at the heart of all this is pedophilia and targeting your children
[09:17.000 --> 09:24.000]  to create this new family structure, which of course only reproduces by stealing other people's children.
[09:24.000 --> 09:29.000]  This is the true evil of this conspiracy that is now public.
[09:29.000 --> 09:30.000]  Now that's all coming out.
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.000]  It was trending on Twitter last night that Alex Jones was writing all this.
[09:33.000 --> 09:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, they know this is coming out because the victims are speaking out.
[09:37.000 --> 09:42.000]  They're acting like this one psychiatrist that ran part of the health service in Berlin was doing it.
[09:42.000 --> 09:43.000]  It was just him.
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's done all over the Western world.
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.000]  That's what drag queen pedophile story times about.
[09:50.000 --> 09:53.000]  That's why Nickelodeon came out 10 years ago and said,
[09:53.000 --> 09:54.000]  we're going to sexualize your kids.
[09:54.000 --> 09:58.000]  Oh, you know, the gay rights movement only want to be able to get married.
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  Now they want access to your kids.
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.000]  At the top of this or at the bottom of it is pedophilia.
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.000]  And it's just that simple and people have to come to grips with it.
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.000]  You know, just this morning, I was getting all these calls and text messages,
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  people saying, why aren't you covering this while I'm on vacation?
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.000]  But before I cut this report, I said, let me go back and just refresh myself on Alfred Kinsey.
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  Well, I wouldn't refresh myself.
[10:24.000 --> 10:25.000]  It was worse than I thought.
[10:25.000 --> 10:30.000]  Just type in his name, Alfred Kinsey, and you get to see Google and everybody just fawning over him.
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.000]  I'm surprised they haven't had a Google doodle for him.
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.000]  Alfred Charles Kinsey was an American biologist,
[10:36.000 --> 10:40.000]  professor of, and he goes on zoology, sexologist,
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  who in 47 founded the Institute for Sex Research in Indiana University,
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.000]  previously known as the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction.
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  And if you want to know where the transgenderism comes from
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  and where the sexualization of children comes from
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  and where all the sex ed telling your five-year-old boy, he might be a girl,
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  your five-year-old girl, she might be something else,
[11:01.000 --> 11:04.000]  this is an assault on innocence.
[11:04.000 --> 11:10.000]  And if you just research the things that Kinsey and others did, it's so monstrous.
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  But the biggest thing they would do is keep children confined in dog cages,
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  which is one of their favorite things to do.
[11:17.000 --> 11:23.000]  In fact, one of these guys did it to his own son, just like Aleister Crowley reportedly sacrificed his own son.
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.000]  That's what these people do.
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.000]  And so you need to understand that they didn't invent all this in the modern world.
[11:30.000 --> 11:34.000]  They were codifying it for the pedophile networks that royalty and others are connected to
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.000]  for social control in this giant satanic scheme.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  And so now you know why Bill Gates is hanging out in Europe
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.000]  and hanging out in the U.S. at Jeffrey Epstein's house and then kind of covered up.
[11:46.000 --> 11:51.000]  Now you know how they were blackmailing the scientists to be under the scientific control right now
[11:51.000 --> 11:56.000]  to roll out the forced inoculation because they want to not just destroy innocence of children,
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.000]  they want to force their way into your body.
[11:59.000 --> 12:04.000]  This is a religion, but they want to put pressure on you, social pressure, until you acquiesce.
[12:04.000 --> 12:12.000]  That's what they really, really want is for you to give in to them and let them do to you what they will.
[12:12.000 --> 12:17.000]  You know, I've been contacted by folks with a particular Joint Terrorism Task Force to say,
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.000]  man, you better be really, really careful.
[12:19.000 --> 12:23.000]  There's an arm of the feds that say that they're going to, quote, hit you.
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.000]  And then I was talking to a fellow just the other day.
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.000]  It was high level in the CIA and some other agencies and groups.
[12:30.000 --> 12:33.000]  And he was saying, yeah, you're probably going to be dead soon.
[12:33.000 --> 12:34.000]  It is the word.
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.000]  That's okay because I don't put kids in cages and I don't rape them.
[12:38.000 --> 12:39.000]  So go ahead.
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  I'm in God's hands.
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  People know that if I get killed or I get imprisoned or I get indicted or I get set up,
[12:44.000 --> 12:45.000]  I'm not a loser.
[12:45.000 --> 12:46.000]  I'm a winner.
[12:46.000 --> 12:47.000]  I did the right thing.
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.000]  I stood up for what was right.
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  And more people need to have courage and say no to this because these children are under attack.
[12:52.000 --> 12:53.000]  Okay.
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  And I didn't just get this from, you know, people in the federal government warning me that,
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.000]  my God, they're really, you know, talking about how you're enemy number one because I'm exposing all this
[13:01.000 --> 13:02.000]  and I've really pissed Bill Gates off.
[13:02.000 --> 13:03.000]  That's fine.
[13:03.000 --> 13:04.000]  Somebody's got to stamp this monster.
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.000]  But I also know a lot of other behind the scenes stuff that has confirmed that the deep state
[13:09.000 --> 13:15.000]  of the Democrat pedophile arm is actually convened, you know, trying to have me arrested
[13:15.000 --> 13:16.000]  right now.
[13:16.000 --> 13:20.000]  It even came out four years ago that Nancy Pelosi's daughter was on Capitol Hill demanding
[13:20.000 --> 13:21.000]  I'd be arrested.
[13:21.000 --> 13:22.000]  And that was even later a bit on Fox News.
[13:22.000 --> 13:23.000]  And they lied about me.
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.000]  And so that I was death-threading Pelosi and her know what I was doing was saying they
[13:27.000 --> 13:30.000]  are secretly trying to get the delegates to not seat Trump.
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.000]  I think it was January 8th, ahead of the January 20th, 2017 inauguration, which was true.
[13:35.000 --> 13:36.000]  It later came out was true.
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.000]  They were so pissed that we exposed it and got it out that they wanted me in prisons
[13:40.000 --> 13:45.000]  because they know time and time again, it's in four wars and this crew and this audience
[13:45.000 --> 13:50.000]  that boosts the information here and yours truly that are able to get these truths out
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.000]  and then they see the chain reaction that brings them down.
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  So whatever happens to me, just keep fighting, keep exposing.
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  Don't back down, ladies and gentlemen, because God demands we stand up for the children.
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  These monsters are coming for everybody anyways.
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  There'll be no civilization left once they have their way.
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.000]  It's us or them, we have to realize how evil they are in this giant pedophile conspiracy
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  they're running and we just have to pray for God's spirit to come to the world and for
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.000]  people to turn away from their wicked ways and seek God's face and find that quiet place
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  the most high that King David talked about.
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.000]  And I just pray that you'll pray for me and my family as well because we are doing important
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.000]  work and we are under amazing attack and I couldn't do this without your prayers and
[14:26.000 --> 14:27.000]  God's support.
[14:27.000 --> 14:28.000]  I really appreciate you all.
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.000]  But yes, ladies and gentlemen, I'm begging you, go read about these psychologists and
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  psychiatrists, show David Knight's a great researcher.
[14:35.000 --> 14:36.000]  I know David knows all about it.
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  I mean, perhaps he can come on the show next Monday or something for an hour and he can
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  compile a lot of the quotes and statements by these guys.
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  When you hear me saying all this, it sounds unreal because you're not like that.
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  But they really do this and more, okay?
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  And they are here to normalize sexual children to be able to have the state and these
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.000]  pedophile priesthoods come and have sex with your children as a sacrament and to ruin
[14:57.000 --> 15:02.000]  their lives and then to bind your children to them in a cult, a sex cult with your children.
[15:02.000 --> 15:08.000]  It's a family to them, a pedophile sex family and that's what the psychiatrist in Berlin
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.000]  was setting up following Alfred Kinsey and others' operations.
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.000]  But Freud, all of them, these are a sick group of devil worshipers obsessed with the most
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  gross stuff you could ever imagine.
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.000]  They're totally turned over to evil and living in denial, ladies and gentlemen, is only going
[15:22.000 --> 15:23.000]  to destroy you, okay?
[15:23.000 --> 15:24.000]  They're coming for your children.
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  They're coming for you.
[15:25.000 --> 15:26.000]  They're coming for your bloodline.
[15:26.000 --> 15:27.000]  They're coming for your genetics.
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.000]  They're coming to rape your very DNA.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  They are demonic.
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  They are the spawn of hell itself.
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.000]  Now, this is a live report, but later when it's archived, banned on video.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  Please remember, the only way this gets out is you.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  This is the rest of the story.
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.000]  It exposes their satanic blackmail rings that control the system, but it's beyond that.
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  That's just a control system.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  It is their religion.
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  We must admit that Satan's real.
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.000]  We must fight the satanic conspiracy with all of our will and with the God's promise
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  and spirit of Holy Ghost shining through us.
[15:56.000 --> 15:57.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[15:57.000 --> 15:58.000]  Thank you all.
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.000]  God bless and good luck.
[16:29.000 --> 16:34.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to be more politically active than you ever have,
[16:34.000 --> 16:39.000]  because we are going into hardcore United Nations-controlled bondage.
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.000]  Major police departments like Los Angeles and Albuquerque, New Mexico are announcing
[16:43.000 --> 16:48.000]  they're going under UN control and turning their, quote, police into community activist
[16:48.000 --> 16:49.000]  organizers.
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.000]  This is just the beginning.
[16:51.000 --> 16:54.000]  Everything's going to accelerate now from this point out.
[16:54.000 --> 16:55.000]  So, it's here.
[16:55.000 --> 16:56.000]  No more games.
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  New World Order has arrived.
[17:26.000 --> 17:33.000]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health, as well as healthy
[17:33.000 --> 17:37.000]  metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[17:37.000 --> 17:42.000]  Iodine may also support your body and healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.000]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of true nascent iodine
[17:46.000 --> 17:47.000]  today.
[17:47.000 --> 17:48.000]  Get the news.

[17:53.000 --> 18:00.000]  new limited first shipment at infowarstore.com.
[18:23.000 --> 18:35.000]  Welcome back.
[18:35.000 --> 18:45.000]  You heard that report from Alex Jones talking about the experiment that was conducted in
[18:45.000 --> 18:46.000]  Germany.
[18:46.000 --> 18:51.120]  They said, well, just to see how this works out, we'll put some kids with some known pedophiles
[18:51.120 --> 18:54.680]  and we'll show that it really doesn't hurt to have that happen.
[18:54.680 --> 19:00.200]  And as Alex was talking about the long-sorted history of the McKinsey Institute there at
[19:00.200 --> 19:08.720]  the University of Indiana, I'll just throw this in as a connection to politics.
[19:08.720 --> 19:14.160]  Perhaps you remember just before the 2018 midterm elections, there was a lot of purging
[19:14.160 --> 19:15.160]  of websites.
[19:15.160 --> 19:21.120]  There was also a lot of purging of social media, especially Facebook pages and so forth.
[19:21.120 --> 19:26.080]  The middle of October just before, you know, it's just a couple of weeks before the election,
[19:26.080 --> 19:27.320]  that was the October surprise.
[19:27.320 --> 19:28.320]  Hey, you're all gone.
[19:28.320 --> 19:30.320]  Shut everybody down.
[19:30.320 --> 19:37.520]  They took out about, they went after the social media sites of about 800 different organizations.
[19:37.520 --> 19:44.480]  Most of them, they were, most of them were Trump, but not all of them were Trump supporters.
[19:44.480 --> 19:50.080]  What they had in common was that they opposed foreign wars, you know, conservatives and
[19:50.080 --> 19:51.800]  liberals can do that.
[19:51.800 --> 19:56.040]  Conservatives and liberals can also oppose the surveillance state and the police state.
[19:56.040 --> 19:59.520]  That seemed to be the common thread as you went through, but they said there's another
[19:59.520 --> 20:00.520]  common thread.
[20:00.520 --> 20:04.480]  They said, oh, these people, some of them, they said, we just don't like their content.
[20:04.480 --> 20:05.480]  They're hateful.
[20:05.480 --> 20:10.680]  They hate continuous foreign wars and they hate the Norwellian society.
[20:10.680 --> 20:15.880]  So we got to get rid of them because that's what we've got in mind for you forever, boot
[20:15.880 --> 20:19.000]  stomping on your face forever.
[20:19.000 --> 20:26.040]  But they also got rid of a lot of purged tens of thousands of social media sites declaring
[20:26.040 --> 20:28.680]  them to be bots.
[20:28.680 --> 20:32.920]  And it was kind of interesting because the list of social media sites that were declared
[20:32.920 --> 20:39.320]  bots were provided by the DNC to the social media companies.
[20:39.320 --> 20:40.320]  And where did the DNC get it?
[20:40.320 --> 20:42.200]  Oh, well, they didn't just make this up.
[20:42.200 --> 20:43.200]  Did they?
[20:43.200 --> 20:44.200]  No, no, no.
[20:44.200 --> 20:45.360]  Actually, they didn't.
[20:45.360 --> 20:51.440]  There is a, a, uh, associated with the Kinsey Institute and here's the association.
[20:51.440 --> 20:56.680]  The guy who runs this is a fellow of the Kinsey Institute, but it's coming out of the University
[20:56.680 --> 20:57.680]  of Indiana.
[20:57.680 --> 21:03.680]  You know, the Kinsey, the Kinsey, uh, uh, sex pervert, uh, section there is a, a, uh,
[21:03.680 --> 21:10.520]  I guess you could call it school, uh, when I went to school, University of South, uh,
[21:10.520 --> 21:14.400]  South Florida, they had, uh, school of engineering, had school of business and so forth.
[21:14.400 --> 21:20.480]  Well, I guess I got the school of pervs at Indiana University, the McKinsey Institute.
[21:20.480 --> 21:24.480]  And they brought a guy over from Italy who was going to be a social media expert, but
[21:24.480 --> 21:27.960]  he just happened to, you know, because he's a social media expert, I guess they put him
[21:27.960 --> 21:32.520]  there on, you know, part of the, uh, board there for the Kinsey Institute.
[21:32.520 --> 21:37.920]  They have a thing called oh, so me about social media.
[21:37.920 --> 21:41.400]  They also have another thing that they do that call bot or not.
[21:41.400 --> 21:45.480]  And so they have these algorithms and they're the ones, you know, the people, this guy who's
[21:45.480 --> 21:50.560]  affiliated with the Kinsey Institute is going to decide whether or not you get to speak.
[21:50.560 --> 21:53.280]  Maybe that explains some of their censorship.
[21:53.280 --> 21:54.280]  You think?
[21:54.280 --> 21:58.480]  But of course, uh, highly connected to the Democrat party as well.
[21:58.480 --> 22:03.320]  I want to get into what is happening today with Juneteenth because we've got a lot of
[22:03.320 --> 22:09.400]  CEOs and we've got Democrats who are pushing for this to be a federal holiday.
[22:09.400 --> 22:14.200]  Uh, I think if you look at what they're pushing though, I think what they're really pushing
[22:14.200 --> 22:17.720]  is division and a coming race war.
[22:17.720 --> 22:27.080]  I said this immediately as soon as people focused on the George Floyd death, I said
[22:27.080 --> 22:32.600]  they're going to use this to really, uh, start a race war as people are locked down, as people
[22:32.600 --> 22:33.600]  are frustrated.
[22:33.600 --> 22:34.600]  This is what they're going to do.
[22:34.600 --> 22:40.120]  And I said it immediately and within a day or two, they had the riots going.
[22:40.120 --> 22:48.800]  Now I want to play for you a video clip of Chick-fil-A's CEO and it is absolutely stunning
[22:48.800 --> 22:51.760]  what he does on a program.
[22:51.760 --> 22:54.920]  Uh, well, I'll just, I'll just let you see what he has to say.
[22:54.920 --> 22:57.320]  Let's play video clip number one.
[22:57.320 --> 23:02.800]  Some of our closing moments here, but a story that was shared with me by a dear friend who
[23:02.800 --> 23:07.400]  shared with me about a revival that was taking place at a church in Texas.
[23:07.400 --> 23:12.040]  And at that revival on the front seat was an older African-American young, uh, older
[23:12.040 --> 23:18.960]  African-American man, man that was sitting there and this young man got up that, uh,
[23:18.960 --> 23:24.760]  was there in that service and he'd been so gripped with conviction about the racism
[23:24.760 --> 23:30.840]  that was in that local community in a small town in Texas that he, he took a, uh, a shoe
[23:30.840 --> 23:36.520]  brush and he walked over to this elderly gentleman and he knelt on his knees and began to shine
[23:36.520 --> 23:41.840]  his shoes and tears began to flow, uh, in that service.
[23:41.840 --> 23:46.080]  Uh, it was an attitude of, uh, of conviction.
[23:46.080 --> 23:51.320]  So I, I invite folks just to, to put some words to action here.
[23:51.320 --> 23:55.400]  And if we need to find somebody that needs to have their shoe shine, we need to just
[23:55.400 --> 23:58.360]  go right on over and shine their shoes.
[23:58.360 --> 23:59.360]  He's kneeling.
[23:59.360 --> 24:04.240]  And whether they got tennis shoes or not, maybe they got sandals on.
[24:04.240 --> 24:05.240]  It really doesn't matter.
[24:05.240 --> 24:06.240]  It doesn't have any shoes that need to be shined.
[24:06.240 --> 24:10.440]  They're actually like, there's a time which we need to have, you know, some, some personal
[24:10.440 --> 24:11.440]  look at that.
[24:11.440 --> 24:12.440]  I'm like, what are you doing?
[24:12.440 --> 24:14.440]  Maybe need to give them a hug too.
[24:14.440 --> 24:15.440]  They do.
[24:15.440 --> 24:16.440]  Don't mess up my shoes.
[24:16.440 --> 24:17.440]  Some stock in Chick-fil-A.
[24:17.440 --> 24:18.440]  Yeah.
[24:18.440 --> 24:19.440]  Gonna get some stock in Chick-fil-A.
[24:19.440 --> 24:20.440]  Well, I don't know.
[24:20.440 --> 24:21.440]  Maybe I won't.
[24:21.440 --> 24:27.240]  You know, this is a 1500 of these and I gave all our two play operators and staff number
[24:27.240 --> 24:28.240]  of years ago.
[24:28.240 --> 24:29.240]  You got 1500 of them.
[24:29.240 --> 24:36.560]  And, uh, so any expressions of a contrite heart of a sense of humility, a sense of shame,
[24:36.560 --> 24:40.560]  a sense of embarrassment, uh, beget with an apologetic heart.
[24:40.560 --> 24:42.920]  I think that's okay.
[24:42.920 --> 24:43.920]  So there you go.
[24:43.920 --> 24:45.600]  That's his, uh, brush with racism.
[24:45.600 --> 24:50.400]  Oh, I guess we could say, uh, it's brushed with white privilege.
[24:50.400 --> 24:55.760]  It goes over to Lecrae and so there's three people on stage for those of you listening,
[24:55.760 --> 25:02.520]  three people on stage, the Christian rapper Lecrae, a black man, a pastor, Louis Jiglio,
[25:02.520 --> 25:03.920]  I think is the way he pronounced his name.
[25:03.920 --> 25:08.960]  He has a big mega church there in Atlanta.
[25:08.960 --> 25:16.240]  And then you have, um, Kathy, who is the son of the founder of Chick-fil-A, another spoiled
[25:16.240 --> 25:18.040]  rich guilty white liberal.
[25:18.040 --> 25:21.680]  This ain't his daddy's Chick-fil-A folks going to eat more chicken.
[25:21.680 --> 25:24.040]  You're going to shine most shoes.
[25:24.040 --> 25:25.040]  What's this about?
[25:25.040 --> 25:27.580]  I mean, that is one of the most pathetic things I've ever seen.
[25:27.580 --> 25:28.580]  This is coming.
[25:28.580 --> 25:33.200]  Let me give you some context here because, uh, there's a lot of context going.
[25:33.200 --> 25:36.000]  This is in Atlanta.
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.360]  And as he goes through this, uh, some of the other comments that he made, you saw that
[25:40.360 --> 25:44.800]  cringe worthy display, uh, virtue signaling going on there.
[25:44.800 --> 25:46.720]  Uh, he urged white people.
[25:46.720 --> 25:51.520]  This, uh, Chick-fil-A CEO, white people repent of their racism because, you know, you are
[25:51.520 --> 25:53.080]  racist if you're white.
[25:53.080 --> 25:55.640]  That's just it.
[25:55.640 --> 25:59.380]  He justified rioters looting and burning down a Wendy's restaurant in Atlanta.
[25:59.380 --> 26:04.280]  We as Caucasians until we're willing to just pick up the baton and fight for a black African
[26:04.280 --> 26:06.680]  American brothers and sisters, which they are as one human race.
[26:06.680 --> 26:07.680]  Well, he got that right.
[26:07.680 --> 26:10.560]  They said, until we fight for them, we're shameful.
[26:10.560 --> 26:16.040]  Well, actually, you know, I tweeted out when I talked about, uh, that's going to be doing
[26:16.040 --> 26:18.920]  a show today for Alex as a guest host.
[26:18.920 --> 26:28.480]  I tweeted out a meme and that meme shows a young white girl and a young Asian girl.
[26:28.480 --> 26:33.360]  And it says, uh, does this young white girl, does she need to apologize for slavery?
[26:33.360 --> 26:39.760]  If she does, does this young Japanese girl, does she need to apologize for Pearl Harbor?
[26:39.760 --> 26:41.160]  That's the mentality.
[26:41.160 --> 26:42.880]  That's the mentality folks.
[26:42.880 --> 26:44.920]  That's what's being pushed by this guy.
[26:44.920 --> 26:48.840]  We'll talk more about this and what these other CEOs are doing around the country.
[26:48.840 --> 26:51.840]  And of course, what Nancy Pelosi and Kamala Harris are doing as well.
[26:51.840 --> 26:52.840]  Stay with us.
[26:52.840 --> 26:53.840]  We'll be right back.
[26:53.840 --> 26:59.600]  I was talking to my Patriot supplier, great suppliers.
[26:59.600 --> 27:02.560]  You can now say four weeks on average for storeable food.
[27:02.560 --> 27:03.640]  It's the highest quality.
[27:03.640 --> 27:05.080]  They've got it.
[27:05.080 --> 27:09.040]  Use this little rest we have caught in the current to come up to the surface, get some
[27:09.040 --> 27:11.280]  air before you get sucked back down.
[27:11.280 --> 27:13.800]  I personally am ordering more storeable food.
[27:13.800 --> 27:20.200]  I have to now start going into defense posture, 80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense
[27:20.200 --> 27:23.720]  trying to fully, you know, stop the globalists and we've given them a good run.
[27:23.720 --> 27:28.000]  And I think down the road, they'll be defeated, but we're going to still go down the hard
[27:28.000 --> 27:29.520]  road now.
[27:29.520 --> 27:30.520]  There were a lot worse roads.
[27:30.520 --> 27:34.560]  We'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still going to be bad
[27:34.560 --> 27:35.560]  in my view.
[27:35.560 --> 27:36.880]  You need to get high quality storeable food.
[27:36.880 --> 27:38.080]  It's something you need.
[27:38.080 --> 27:42.040]  We have high quality ready to get out to you and it supports the broadcast and 360 wins.
[27:42.040 --> 27:46.800]  So please take care of your storeable foods needs at infowarstore.com and get your orders
[27:46.800 --> 27:47.800]  in now.
[27:47.800 --> 27:48.800]  So you get it.
[27:48.800 --> 27:49.800]  So you have it.
[27:49.800 --> 27:50.800]  It's in great containers.
[27:50.800 --> 27:51.800]  High quality.
[27:51.800 --> 27:52.800]  Last 25 years.
[27:52.800 --> 27:53.800]  Get it while you can.
[27:53.800 --> 27:57.800]  Because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[27:57.800 --> 27:58.800]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[27:58.800 --> 27:59.800]  You're on the air.
[27:59.800 --> 28:00.800]  Thanks for holding.
[28:00.800 --> 28:01.800]  Hello.
[28:01.800 --> 28:02.800]  Can you hear me?
[28:02.800 --> 28:03.800]  I sure can, sir.
[28:03.800 --> 28:04.800]  Thank you.
[28:04.800 --> 28:05.800]  Hey, Alex.
[28:05.800 --> 28:06.800]  Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro.
[28:06.800 --> 28:08.800]  And it's a pleasure to be talking right now here, man.
[28:08.800 --> 28:10.800]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[28:10.800 --> 28:14.520]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in.
[28:14.520 --> 28:19.000]  I'm a truck driver, and two before us have changed the way I drive.
[28:19.000 --> 28:25.000]  Me and my brothers that drive, and a couple of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto
[28:25.000 --> 28:26.000]  Ricans.
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.960]  We used to be on Monster, and Red Bull, and Rolla, and I have lost weight because I stopped
[28:31.960 --> 28:34.800]  drinking all that sugar, and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[28:34.800 --> 28:39.360]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term high-quality energy powder
[28:39.360 --> 28:40.360]  there is.
[28:40.360 --> 28:42.600]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country.
[28:42.600 --> 28:45.640]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues, but we had to pay a
[28:45.640 --> 28:49.000]  lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it, and we believe it is the
[28:49.000 --> 28:53.120]  best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there, and you're saying that it's made your
[28:53.120 --> 28:54.440]  life better, so that means a lot to me.
[28:54.440 --> 28:55.440]  Thank you.
[28:55.440 --> 28:57.720]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[28:57.720 --> 29:03.280]  David Rockefeller and other satanic pieces of garbage who thought they'd set up their
[29:03.280 --> 29:11.120]  world government, believed they pulled the drain on America a long time ago, but if we
[29:11.120 --> 29:19.200]  understand that they've orchestrated this by design, that there's a mass awakening,
[29:19.200 --> 29:24.840]  it can be their unraveling, their destruction, and them going down the drain.
[29:24.840 --> 29:29.000]  The Bible tells us that many times when the enemy digs a pit for us, they themselves fall
[29:29.000 --> 29:34.760]  into it, but God is the master of the universe, but gives us free will, and this plan is a
[29:34.760 --> 29:35.760]  test.
[29:35.760 --> 29:39.800]  It is up to us to decide whether we're going down the drain or whether the globalists
[29:39.800 --> 29:41.520]  are going down the drain.
[29:41.520 --> 29:46.840]  I cannot express to listeners and viewers of this broadcast how important you are.
[29:46.840 --> 29:48.640]  Everything hinges on you.
[29:48.640 --> 29:49.640]  Everything.
[29:49.640 --> 29:50.640]  Peacefully.
[29:50.640 --> 29:51.640]  Become the Paul Revere.
[29:51.640 --> 29:53.200]  You know you've always been.
[29:53.200 --> 29:59.520]  God bless and good luck.
[29:59.520 --> 30:25.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:25.120 --> 30:40.360]  When I look at the comments that he made, the pandering that he was doing, things that
[30:40.360 --> 30:46.760]  he said, white Christians should have a sense of shame, should have an apologetic heart.
[30:46.760 --> 30:49.640]  Our silence is so huge at this time.
[30:49.640 --> 30:54.520]  Silence is violence, said the CEO of Chick-fil-A.
[30:54.520 --> 30:56.000]  We cannot be silent.
[30:56.000 --> 30:58.560]  Somebody's got to fight.
[30:58.560 --> 31:06.200]  Then when he came to making these remarks there in Atlanta, after you had the man who
[31:06.200 --> 31:15.480]  was shot and killed by the police officer, they burned that Wendy's down.
[31:15.480 --> 31:18.800]  How is Wendy's responsible for that in any way, shape, or form?
[31:18.800 --> 31:23.040]  He said, we shouldn't just be criticizing people burning down that restaurant last night.
[31:23.040 --> 31:26.000]  You've got to understand their sense of frustration.
[31:26.000 --> 31:29.800]  The incredible amounts of frustration and pain.
[31:29.800 --> 31:33.560]  White people are just oblivious to all of that.
[31:33.560 --> 31:34.560]  Oh really?
[31:34.560 --> 31:35.560]  Really?
[31:35.560 --> 31:39.120]  I think you're missing the point here.
[31:39.120 --> 31:42.480]  You know, a lot of people got angry with me because, quite frankly, I didn't think that
[31:42.480 --> 31:44.000]  that shooting was justified.
[31:44.000 --> 31:46.400]  Yeah, the guy was a scumbag.
[31:46.400 --> 31:50.760]  Yeah, the guy had been in jail and he shouldn't have been let out of jail, quite frankly.
[31:50.760 --> 31:53.760]  That's really where the first problem came.
[31:53.760 --> 31:55.280]  He shouldn't have been let out of jail.
[31:55.280 --> 31:58.520]  He had been abusive to his family.
[31:58.520 --> 32:05.840]  He was drunk or under the influence of something in the drive-through and the cops tried to
[32:05.840 --> 32:09.520]  talk to him for 20 minutes or so.
[32:09.520 --> 32:14.360]  And then he ran for it and he grabbed the taser of the cop and ran for it.
[32:14.360 --> 32:20.520]  When he's running, he over his shoulder, he shoots the taser and then at that point,
[32:20.520 --> 32:24.080]  the cop pulls out his gun and shoots him in the back as he's running away.
[32:24.080 --> 32:27.080]  And that's the problem I have with what the cop did.
[32:27.080 --> 32:30.520]  So you don't have to say that one of these guys is a saint.
[32:30.520 --> 32:31.520]  Neither one of them are saints.
[32:31.520 --> 32:32.520]  They both made mistakes.
[32:32.520 --> 32:37.920]  The problem is, is that if somebody is running away from you, you don't shoot them in the
[32:37.920 --> 32:38.920]  back.
[32:38.920 --> 32:44.560]  You know, one of the reasons why, and it was kind of funny the other day, it was noticed
[32:44.560 --> 32:51.120]  that O.J. Simpson, many of you may remember, in the 90s, that long, prolonged chase of
[32:51.120 --> 32:54.240]  O.J. Simpson through L.A., why did that happen?
[32:54.240 --> 32:55.240]  For so long.
[32:55.240 --> 32:56.240]  I went on for hours.
[32:56.240 --> 32:57.960]  There were tens of millions of people that watched that live.
[32:57.960 --> 33:00.160]  The whole country was watching it live.
[33:00.160 --> 33:01.160]  Why did that happen?
[33:01.160 --> 33:06.480]  Well, it was a slow-speed chase that was happening.
[33:06.480 --> 33:12.560]  And the reason it was a slow-speed chase was because the police had changed their rules.
[33:12.560 --> 33:17.000]  See, a lot of innocent people had gotten killed when the police decided that they were going
[33:17.000 --> 33:21.600]  to, you know, do whatever it takes to stop a car that's running from them.
[33:21.600 --> 33:24.520]  And wisely, they decided, all right, we'll just play it cool.
[33:24.520 --> 33:28.240]  We'll follow him for hours until he runs out of gas or whatever.
[33:28.240 --> 33:29.840]  And we got helicopters.
[33:29.840 --> 33:30.840]  We got radios.
[33:30.840 --> 33:31.840]  We got him in sight.
[33:31.840 --> 33:32.840]  He didn't get out of our sight.
[33:32.840 --> 33:36.160]  He isn't going to get away.
[33:36.160 --> 33:38.800]  But you know, they didn't resort to deadly force.
[33:38.800 --> 33:46.200]  And the problem is, is that guy was a low-life loser, multiple-time loser.
[33:46.200 --> 33:48.520]  But still, you don't shoot somebody like that in the back.
[33:48.520 --> 33:56.880]  That's why on my program, I showed an example of a guy coming in with his face covered and
[33:56.880 --> 34:01.480]  he started a holdup in a store.
[34:01.480 --> 34:03.200]  And the guy that was on the store had concealed carry.
[34:03.200 --> 34:05.760]  He pulled it out and it began a gunfight.
[34:05.760 --> 34:08.240]  And the guy was shot in his hip.
[34:08.240 --> 34:09.240]  The bad guy.
[34:09.240 --> 34:12.280]  But they were shooting at each other over the count.
[34:12.280 --> 34:16.640]  And the guy crawled away and the gun was right next to him.
[34:16.640 --> 34:22.920]  And the good guy in the store, who was defending himself and his employee and defending their
[34:22.920 --> 34:26.520]  lives, said, get away from the gun or I'll shoot.
[34:26.520 --> 34:29.880]  And he had him, you know, the guy didn't have his gun.
[34:29.880 --> 34:30.880]  He had the gun pointed on him.
[34:30.880 --> 34:33.360]  And he crawled away and then ran away.
[34:33.360 --> 34:37.240]  And the guy called 9-11, told the other neighbors there, be careful, there's a dangerous guy
[34:37.240 --> 34:38.240]  out here.
[34:38.240 --> 34:40.880]  Let's see if he had been a cop.
[34:40.880 --> 34:44.800]  Because of the rules of immunity, he would have been entitled, or at least thought that
[34:44.800 --> 34:49.920]  he was entitled, to go ahead and empty his gun into that guy when he was no longer a
[34:49.920 --> 34:50.920]  threat.
[34:50.920 --> 34:53.960]  Now that guy was still facing him and his gun was within reach and he didn't reach
[34:53.960 --> 34:54.960]  for it.
[34:54.960 --> 34:59.320]  But if you shoot as a citizen, you need to understand this, if as a citizen, you shoot
[34:59.320 --> 35:02.560]  somebody in the back that is running away from you.
[35:02.560 --> 35:06.280]  You're going to be facing charges and rightfully so, in my opinion.
[35:06.280 --> 35:09.920]  Somebody breaks into your home, takes your stuff, starts running out the door, even if
[35:09.920 --> 35:11.360]  they shoved you.
[35:11.360 --> 35:17.440]  If they're still not fighting you, if your life is not at risk, yeah, you have the right
[35:17.440 --> 35:20.680]  to defend yourself if they're coming at you, absolutely you do.
[35:20.680 --> 35:23.480]  And I would suggest that you do.
[35:23.480 --> 35:27.800]  But if they're running away, you don't shoot them in the back.
[35:27.800 --> 35:30.640]  And we should not have different rules for different groups of people.
[35:30.640 --> 35:35.040]  I tweeted out the other day, you know, we've got immunity for big pharmaceutical companies
[35:35.040 --> 35:37.280]  for vaccines.
[35:37.280 --> 35:40.480]  We got immunity for cops who are doing this.
[35:40.480 --> 35:41.720]  How's that working out for us?
[35:41.720 --> 35:44.240]  Should we be giving immunity, legal immunity to people?
[35:44.240 --> 35:47.960]  I think it just corrupts these organizations when that happens.
[35:47.960 --> 35:52.760]  So you need to understand that there's something different happening here and that no matter
[35:52.760 --> 36:01.280]  who you think was right or wrong, it's not justified to go burn down somebody's business.
[36:01.280 --> 36:09.960]  And so when you see this entitled, privileged, white, rich liberal, the CEO of Chick-fil-A,
[36:09.960 --> 36:15.160]  talking about this, what he is suggesting to people is that they are entitled to get
[36:15.160 --> 36:16.160]  violent.
[36:16.160 --> 36:17.160]  They're entitled to loot.
[36:17.160 --> 36:21.920]  They're entitled to burn buildings because, you know, they're frustrated.
[36:21.920 --> 36:23.420]  So that's fine.
[36:23.420 --> 36:27.880]  Maybe he's just happy that they burned his competitor.
[36:27.880 --> 36:28.880]  I don't know.
[36:28.880 --> 36:35.040]  But when you look at this, I mean, just the story that broke earlier this week, the 92-year-old
[36:35.040 --> 36:41.320]  woman, the black guy, the young black guy walking past her just smacks her in the head,
[36:41.320 --> 36:44.200]  you know, because she's a filthy white person.
[36:44.200 --> 36:45.200]  She deserves it.
[36:45.200 --> 36:50.080]  You know, the slave owner there, right?
[36:50.080 --> 36:53.240]  And she's now afraid to walk in her own neighborhood.
[36:53.240 --> 36:55.200]  She has lived in New York for 50 years.
[36:55.200 --> 36:56.840]  She's never had anything like this.
[36:56.840 --> 36:58.800]  Why is this happening now?
[36:58.800 --> 37:05.560]  Because the racism that's being fermented by white liberals, like the Chick-fil-A CEO,
[37:05.560 --> 37:08.680]  she said, I thought a brick hit me or something, hit me on the left side of my head.
[37:08.680 --> 37:11.440]  I went right down, hit my head against the hydrant.
[37:11.440 --> 37:13.080]  I thought she'd missed the hydrant, but she did.
[37:13.080 --> 37:16.800]  She said blood was coming out, not spurting blood, but blood was dripping.
[37:16.800 --> 37:20.680]  She said her physical wounds are relatively minor, and they've healed, but the mental
[37:20.680 --> 37:22.400]  toll has been much more severe.
[37:22.400 --> 37:25.600]  She's afraid to walk in her own neighborhood in Houston.
[37:25.600 --> 37:34.720]  He had a guy who was in a grocery store caught on surveillance footage, and he had several
[37:34.720 --> 37:38.960]  black guys jump in front of the line, and he said, hey, wait, we got a line here.
[37:38.960 --> 37:44.160]  And because of that, when he walked out, they started attacking him and saying, black lives
[37:44.160 --> 37:46.880]  matter, black lives matter.
[37:46.880 --> 37:49.720]  This is what is being fermented by these people.
[37:49.720 --> 37:53.360]  Also happened in Ocean City, Maryland, large brawl there.
[37:53.360 --> 38:00.640]  Even in Australia, you got a white girl that is on a bus beaten by a group of black girls.
[38:00.640 --> 38:05.200]  This is being engendered by people who are saying, you are entitled to this.
[38:05.200 --> 38:09.840]  You have been wronged by these people, and they haven't been wronged by these people.
[38:09.840 --> 38:13.920]  These people are not guilty simply because they're white.
[38:13.920 --> 38:18.040]  But that's what this CEO is telling them.
[38:18.040 --> 38:26.480]  And remember, when we look at this guy, somebody pushed back on this with me.
[38:26.480 --> 38:32.520]  And when I said, just another spoiled, rich, guilty, white liberal, somebody on Twitter
[38:32.520 --> 38:35.840]  said, well, it's called humility, something that Jesus liked you to have.
[38:35.840 --> 38:38.600]  And I said, no, it's called virtue signaling.
[38:38.600 --> 38:42.080]  It's really a form of self-righteousness and pride.
[38:42.080 --> 38:47.400]  And in this context, he is fomenting racism.
[38:47.400 --> 38:49.360]  Christ is colorblind.
[38:49.360 --> 38:51.360]  And he is right.
[38:51.360 --> 38:53.360]  He did make us all of one blood.
[38:53.360 --> 38:54.360]  You know, we're all descended.
[38:54.360 --> 38:56.320]  If you're a Christian, you believe the Bible?
[38:56.320 --> 38:57.320]  We're all descended from Adam.
[38:57.320 --> 38:59.480]  We're descended from Noah.
[38:59.480 --> 39:02.960]  Christ doesn't see black and white.
[39:02.960 --> 39:10.920]  But these people, by focusing on that, what they do is they throw out the work of Christ.
[39:10.920 --> 39:15.480]  You know, Christ reconciled us not just to God, but to each other, to himself.
[39:15.480 --> 39:17.680]  That's what Christians understand.
[39:17.680 --> 39:24.360]  And so I don't get these pastors, like this guy who's putting on this show, along with
[39:24.360 --> 39:30.120]  the CEO of Chick-fil-A. I don't understand where they're coming from, frankly.
[39:30.120 --> 39:34.000]  You know, is it not good enough for them that Christ has reconciled us?
[39:34.000 --> 39:37.720]  I've got more to say about this when we come back and I'll tell you what these other CEOs
[39:37.720 --> 39:38.720]  are doing.
[39:38.720 --> 39:41.040]  And I'll tell you what Nancy Pelosi and Kamala Harris are doing.
[39:41.040 --> 39:42.040]  We'll be right back.
[39:42.040 --> 39:49.040]  So, well, thank you guys for talking to us that eternal faith has turned its back on
[39:49.040 --> 39:50.040]  here.
[39:50.040 --> 39:51.040]  It's 2 a.m.
[39:51.040 --> 39:52.040]  It's 2 a.m.
[39:52.040 --> 39:53.040]  Here it is.
[39:53.040 --> 39:54.040]  Here it is.
[39:54.040 --> 40:05.000]  It's finally here, introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray, available now for 33% off

[40:08.920 --> 40:15.720]  Others have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep

[40:55.600 --> 41:01.560]  We were told by the United Nations, we were told by the CDC and Fauci that two plus million
[41:01.560 --> 41:07.120]  Americans would die, that millions of Europeans would die, if we did not do exactly as they
[41:07.120 --> 41:08.120]  said.
[41:08.120 --> 41:12.960]  And it turned out it was all frauds, the models, the testing, taking regular deaths and putting
[41:12.960 --> 41:16.720]  it in the COVID-19 column, all a complete criminal fraud.
[41:16.720 --> 41:20.520]  But none of them are getting sued, none of them are getting prosecuted, none of them
[41:20.520 --> 41:24.640]  are getting in trouble except for Bill Gates, the FDA, shut down his fact-primes that are
[41:24.640 --> 41:28.520]  making fake COVID tests that show everyone is positive.
[41:28.520 --> 41:33.120]  And despite that, they're still testing record numbers of people, creating hysteria and saying
[41:33.120 --> 41:38.560]  the numbers spiking and why it will be 200,000 dead by the election, and it's all Trump's
[41:38.560 --> 41:39.560]  fault.
[41:39.560 --> 41:44.120]  And now, oh, China had 40 cases in one city, we've got to lock down again, everything's
[41:44.120 --> 41:45.120]  over.
[41:45.120 --> 41:48.720]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the new order teaching us to be total prisoners.
[41:48.720 --> 41:52.720]  Either we expose the COVID hoax or all permanently enslaved by it.

[44:00.480 --> 44:26.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:26.480 --> 44:37.200]  All right, I'm not finished with this, it's Jake Bellasio.
[44:37.200 --> 44:42.000]  This got me so triggered, yeah, it really did.
[44:42.000 --> 44:48.480]  Because it was such a, it's not just white liberals, but he is lecturing Christians.
[44:48.480 --> 44:52.840]  And again, Christ reconciles, not just to God but to each other, he doesn't see black
[44:52.840 --> 44:53.840]  and white.
[44:53.840 --> 44:57.200]  He sees two different races that are racing either way from him or towards them.
[44:57.200 --> 44:58.200]  That's it.
[44:58.200 --> 44:59.200]  That's it.
[44:59.200 --> 45:04.480]  And the reason this is being done here is because of the third person on the stage,
[45:04.480 --> 45:13.440]  Pastor Louis Giglio, suggested that white privilege should be called a white blessing.
[45:13.440 --> 45:17.400]  Can you believe this?
[45:17.400 --> 45:23.080]  Days after suggesting to rapper Lecrae that white privilege be renamed a white blessing,
[45:23.080 --> 45:24.960]  because it triggers some white people.
[45:24.960 --> 45:30.600]  He's taking that back and saying, oh, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm just so heartbroken
[45:30.600 --> 45:31.600]  about this.
[45:31.600 --> 45:34.320]  Yes, white privilege is real.
[45:34.320 --> 45:39.200]  And we need to change that to the phrase white blessing.
[45:39.200 --> 45:42.200]  And he says, I'm sorry about my horrible choice of words.
[45:42.200 --> 45:46.360]  It doesn't reflect my heart, but what does reflect this heart?
[45:46.360 --> 45:47.760]  You know, there's another disease out there.
[45:47.760 --> 45:48.760]  It's called influenza.
[45:48.760 --> 45:49.760]  It's not COVID-19.
[45:49.760 --> 45:54.400]  I'm sorry, not influenza, affluenza.
[45:54.400 --> 46:03.760]  The other kind of influenza, yeah, affluenza is people that are affected by a love of money.
[46:03.760 --> 46:10.040]  And it does affect a lot of big church pastors who are all out there trying to pander to people.
[46:10.040 --> 46:13.480]  They were trying to solve all the world's problems by themselves, trying to earn their
[46:13.480 --> 46:16.720]  way for things that have already been done for them.
[46:16.720 --> 46:25.000]  You know, a pastor like this ought to understand that God's blessing is often found in adversity.
[46:25.000 --> 46:30.360]  You know, if you've been a Christian for a while, and you've been through some rough
[46:30.360 --> 46:38.960]  times, you find that even though nobody likes it, some of the best times in my life have
[46:38.960 --> 46:43.480]  been my times of adversity, when I look back on them.
[46:43.480 --> 46:49.400]  And so when you look at it, you know, what is going to be a better time as a Christian?
[46:49.400 --> 46:55.120]  Is it going to be the poverty or the privilege and the prosperity?
[46:55.120 --> 46:58.840]  And if we want to talk about civil war history, we want to talk about the history of our country.
[46:58.840 --> 47:06.080]  You know, the South was one of the richest, was the richest area by far away.
[47:06.080 --> 47:15.400]  They had, before the civil war, there had been five presidents out of Virginia.
[47:15.400 --> 47:21.560]  As a matter of fact, if you wanted to sound sophisticated before the civil war, you would
[47:21.560 --> 47:25.280]  speak with a Southern accent, even if you didn't have one.
[47:25.280 --> 47:27.200]  After the civil war, it changed.
[47:27.200 --> 47:34.080]  You had about five presidents that were out of Ohio, and then the Midwest accent became
[47:34.080 --> 47:36.120]  predominant.
[47:36.120 --> 47:41.040]  But I think one of the best things that ever happened to the South, really, was losing
[47:41.040 --> 47:45.640]  the war and losing their prosperity and their privilege.
[47:45.640 --> 47:46.800]  It became the Bible Belt.
[47:46.800 --> 47:48.200]  I don't think that was a coincidence.
[47:48.200 --> 47:54.680]  And you know, before the war, do you think it was a coincidence that you had such a
[47:54.680 --> 48:01.920]  deep religious fervor with the slaves and their spirituals that they did?
[48:01.920 --> 48:08.680]  That is, I can imagine, there were a lot of slaves who had a much richer relationship
[48:08.680 --> 48:11.620]  with Christ than their rich masters did.
[48:11.620 --> 48:13.320]  Not much was stretched to imagine that.
[48:13.320 --> 48:16.840]  As a matter of fact, if you're a pastor, you might want to talk to people about the rich
[48:16.840 --> 48:21.880]  man in Lazarus, instead of all this social engineering stuff, I mean, getting pulled
[48:21.880 --> 48:23.880]  into that kind of nonsense.
[48:23.880 --> 48:26.240]  I mean, who do you want to be?
[48:26.240 --> 48:29.240]  Do you want to be the rich man, or do you want to be Lazarus?
[48:29.240 --> 48:32.240]  That's what the pastor should be focusing on.
[48:32.240 --> 48:37.400]  He should stop pushing this reparations stuff and payment.
[48:37.400 --> 48:44.760]  And you're going to have the sins of your ancestors focused on you, absolutely not.
[48:44.760 --> 48:46.160]  Absolutely not as a Christian.
[48:46.160 --> 48:50.400]  And then when you look at the Chick-fil-A CEO, as I pointed out in the tweet, this is
[48:50.400 --> 48:56.640]  a guy who just threw Christian organizations under the bus last year at the behest of
[48:56.640 --> 49:04.920]  LGBT groups who were hammering them on that.
[49:04.920 --> 49:09.320]  And so he threw under the bus, he threw the Salvation Army, threw the fellowship of Christian
[49:09.320 --> 49:10.320]  athletes on the bus.
[49:10.320 --> 49:14.880]  We're not going to give them any more money because they believe in traditional marriage.
[49:14.880 --> 49:17.920]  And that's hateful to the LGBT groups.
[49:17.920 --> 49:23.720]  You know, I had, as I mentioned that, some person came back and said, because I mentioned
[49:23.720 --> 49:29.760]  that in the tweet, person came back and said, hey, David, since when has every LGBT person
[49:29.760 --> 49:33.520]  been of the left rather curious about your absurd logic?
[49:33.520 --> 49:36.160]  You know, you can be conservative and be LGBT.
[49:36.160 --> 49:39.760]  And I said, that's right, you can be black and conservative, but don't expect to get
[49:39.760 --> 49:42.720]  any love from the black advocacy groups.
[49:42.720 --> 49:45.520]  They're going to hate you and try to destroy your life.
[49:45.520 --> 49:50.680]  And the same thing is true if you're LGBT and conservative as well.
[49:50.680 --> 49:55.520]  Don't expect any respect or love or you're going to get nothing but bricks thrown at
[49:55.520 --> 50:03.520]  you from the LGBT advocacy groups because it's this kind of polarization and group think
[50:03.520 --> 50:07.440]  and political parties that is destroying this country.
[50:07.440 --> 50:11.040]  No, you got to either be with the blacks and support everything that you got to support
[50:11.040 --> 50:16.320]  them burning down Wendy's or you're with the cops who shoot people in the back.
[50:16.320 --> 50:17.920]  I'm not with either one of those groups.
[50:17.920 --> 50:19.420]  Thank you.
[50:19.420 --> 50:21.840]  I oppose both of them.
[50:21.840 --> 50:25.320]  I think we need to have real serious reform and I've said this for a long time.
[50:25.320 --> 50:32.840]  I said the block to reforming the police is by making it about racism because you understand
[50:32.840 --> 50:35.720]  the federal government doesn't want reform of the police.
[50:35.720 --> 50:39.840]  The federal government wants to run the police and these proposals that are coming out of
[50:39.840 --> 50:43.960]  the Trump administration are only going to further consolidate centralized control of
[50:43.960 --> 50:44.960]  the police.
[50:44.960 --> 50:46.480]  That's a very dangerous thing.
[50:46.480 --> 50:48.880]  I do not support that.
[50:48.880 --> 50:53.560]  I do not support the federal government setting the rules, setting the training, rewarding
[50:53.560 --> 51:00.000]  people who do what they want, creating all kinds of reports about what happens to people
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.200]  based on their skin color and ethnic group and so forth.
[51:03.200 --> 51:08.120]  This is a recipe for even more conflict because what the government wants right now, what
[51:08.120 --> 51:13.360]  they are pushing us toward right now is civil war.
[51:13.360 --> 51:19.480]  They've known that the timing is right generationally, got multiple people, I'll talk about this
[51:19.480 --> 51:24.480]  coming up, multiple people have pointed out whether they're economists or whether they're
[51:24.480 --> 51:25.480]  historians.
[51:25.480 --> 51:28.760]  They said, you know, we're at a time right now where this stuff is going to break down.
[51:28.760 --> 51:33.560]  Some of them predicted it 10 years ago, some of them predicted it 30 years ago and it's
[51:33.560 --> 51:35.000]  all happening.
[51:35.000 --> 51:39.800]  You don't think that the UN and the federal government understands this cycle of history
[51:39.800 --> 51:40.800]  that we're in right now.
[51:40.800 --> 51:42.360]  You don't think they're exploiting that?
[51:42.360 --> 51:43.800]  Yes, they are.
[51:43.800 --> 51:49.400]  34% of American voters think the civil war is likely a second civil war, Rasmussen poll.
[51:49.400 --> 51:52.200]  Sometime in the next five years.
[51:52.200 --> 51:59.640]  And believe me, I'm one of those people and it's been kind of interesting to watch this
[51:59.640 --> 52:00.640]  unfold.
[52:00.640 --> 52:03.960]  And so we have the corporate CEOs out there.
[52:03.960 --> 52:08.520]  You got Jeff Bezos saying slavery ended a long time ago, but racism didn't.
[52:08.520 --> 52:11.960]  And so he's urging employees to cancel meetings on Juneteenth.
[52:11.960 --> 52:17.360]  Interestingly enough, Jeff Bezos, who's all about the money, to have a few of these virtue
[52:17.360 --> 52:22.960]  signaling CEOs who are pushing Juneteenth that did not make it a paid holiday.
[52:22.960 --> 52:28.680]  He just said, well, you don't have to have a meeting, still got to work, got to come
[52:28.680 --> 52:30.400]  to there and got to work.
[52:30.400 --> 52:34.720]  But here's something that Nike made it a paid company holiday target, made it a paid company
[52:34.720 --> 52:37.280]  holiday Amazon again, not a paid company holiday.
[52:37.280 --> 52:38.880]  Just cancel some meetings.
[52:38.880 --> 52:41.160]  It'll look bad.
[52:41.160 --> 52:46.000]  Square and square, Jack Dorsey, who owns both those paid company holiday.
[52:46.000 --> 52:54.160]  You've got same thing with Google is same thing as Amazon, the really greedy Silicon
[52:54.160 --> 52:55.160]  Valley people.
[52:55.160 --> 52:56.160]  Well, don't have any meetings.
[52:56.160 --> 53:01.680]  We're not going to pay you for this JPMorgan is going to close its branches and count its
[53:01.680 --> 53:05.520]  money instead of doing Spotify, paid company holiday.
[53:05.520 --> 53:08.920]  Then you got the car companies, GM.
[53:08.920 --> 53:14.480]  And I got this sent to me in the mail, email from employee and if you want to send me some
[53:14.480 --> 53:17.400]  tips is David Night Show at protonmail.com.
[53:17.400 --> 53:18.400]  I'm not going to mention his name.
[53:18.400 --> 53:20.960]  He said you could mention my name because he was so upset about it.
[53:20.960 --> 53:25.440]  He works for Fiat Chrysler, FCA, Fiat Chrysler America.
[53:25.440 --> 53:31.200]  He said I work at one of the major three plants and car plants in Kokomo, Indiana.
[53:31.200 --> 53:35.360]  We are seriously stopping production because of George Floyd.
[53:35.360 --> 53:42.600]  Eight minutes, 46 seconds and they're doing it at 846 a.m. and 846 p.m.
[53:42.600 --> 53:51.400]  And he sent me the memo and that's in Indiana because of something that happened in Minneapolis.
[53:51.400 --> 53:55.440]  He says what better way to start my Friday morning than to remind all the black people
[53:55.440 --> 53:59.040]  how much they really hate white people and that's really what this is about.
[53:59.040 --> 54:01.680]  And you know, it's not just FCA.
[54:01.680 --> 54:05.240]  It's also General Motors is doing the same thing at exactly the same time, which
[54:05.240 --> 54:10.160]  makes me think this is something coming from the United Auto Workers because I don't know
[54:10.160 --> 54:14.960]  if Ford is doing that Toyota Honda, other places who have facilities here.
[54:14.960 --> 54:16.200]  We got to take a break, folks.
[54:16.200 --> 54:19.000]  Take a look at the products we've got at infowarstore.com.
[54:19.000 --> 54:23.360]  I'll tell you what's coming up with Juneteenth in terms of holiday when we come back, but
[54:23.360 --> 54:24.560]  take a look at the products we have.
[54:24.560 --> 54:30.360]  We've got 70% off of our eight pack power stack, a.m. and p.m. supplements with that.
[54:30.360 --> 54:31.360]  70% off.
[54:31.360 --> 54:38.200]  The Brainforce Plus, our number one bestseller, 60% off infowarstore.com, we really do appreciate
[54:38.200 --> 54:39.200]  your support.
[54:39.200 --> 54:46.960]  We'll be right back.
[54:46.960 --> 54:52.520]  David Rockefeller and other satanic pieces of garbage who thought they'd set up their
[54:52.520 --> 55:00.120]  world government believe they pulled the drain on America a long time ago.
[55:00.120 --> 55:08.440]  So if we understand that they've orchestrated this by design, and if there's a mass awakening,
[55:08.440 --> 55:14.080]  it can be their unraveling, their destruction, and them going down the drain.
[55:14.080 --> 55:18.280]  The Bible tells us that many times when the enemy digs a pit for us, they themselves fall
[55:18.280 --> 55:19.280]  into it.
[55:19.280 --> 55:24.440]  But God is the master of the universe but gives us free will on this planet as a test.
[55:24.440 --> 55:29.120]  It is up to us to decide whether we're going down the drain or whether the globalists are
[55:29.120 --> 55:30.720]  going down the drain.
[55:30.720 --> 55:36.000]  I cannot express to listeners and viewers of this broadcast how important you are.
[55:36.000 --> 55:37.840]  Everything hinges on you.
[55:37.840 --> 55:42.480]  Everything peacefully become the Paul Revere you know you've always been.
[55:42.480 --> 55:46.600]  God bless and good luck.
[55:46.600 --> 55:49.880]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism.
[55:49.880 --> 55:55.040]  And so populist movements are throwing the globalist out of their countries.
[55:55.040 --> 55:59.520]  That's why the New World Order is instituting race war and division and telling the people
[55:59.520 --> 56:04.880]  that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying
[56:04.880 --> 56:06.840]  essential services.
[56:06.840 --> 56:12.040]  This is an attempt to have society collapse and the globalists as they've done in the
[56:12.040 --> 56:14.760]  third world will come in and pick up the pieces.
[56:14.760 --> 56:20.560]  We must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU openly saying defund
[56:20.560 --> 56:21.560]  the police.
[56:21.560 --> 56:25.440]  The police have a lot of problems, we all have a lot of problems, but this is our government
[56:25.440 --> 56:27.080]  and our local vocabulary.
[56:27.080 --> 56:31.760]  And believe me once the globalists have overthrown this country, they are going to put in a real
[56:31.760 --> 56:34.040]  police state where you have no due process or freedom.
[56:34.040 --> 56:38.600]  The globalists believe communist China is the model of the world and they are orchestrating
[56:38.600 --> 56:39.960]  this entire thing.
[56:39.960 --> 56:49.960]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed, infowars.com.
[56:49.960 --> 57:19.800]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:19.800 --> 57:26.920]  We've got a story at infowars.com, at least eight people were shot during a two hour span
[57:26.920 --> 57:31.680]  in Minneapolis on Tuesday and total nine people were wounded in separate shootings around
[57:31.680 --> 57:33.320]  the city overnight.
[57:33.320 --> 57:37.040]  One incident, two women were hit by a drive-by shooting along with a third victim who turned
[57:37.040 --> 57:38.480]  up at a local hospital.
[57:38.480 --> 57:43.200]  Minutes after the drive-by, two men dropped off at a hospital suffering from gunshot
[57:43.200 --> 57:44.200]  injuries.
[57:44.200 --> 57:48.120]  Subsequently, two more men with gunshot wounds arrived at an emergency room in the city.
[57:48.120 --> 57:50.520]  So, how's that working out for you guys there?
[57:50.520 --> 57:55.880]  You know, we look at the population of Minneapolis, 425,000 people in Minneapolis.
[57:55.880 --> 57:58.480]  I mean, this is looking like Chicago, isn't it?
[57:58.480 --> 58:00.800]  Except, Chicago's got about 3 million.
[58:00.800 --> 58:05.520]  It's about six times the number of people yet they're getting about the same number
[58:05.520 --> 58:06.680]  of shootings here.
[58:06.680 --> 58:08.520]  It's absolutely amazing.
[58:08.520 --> 58:14.320]  The violence comes amid a sharp rise in shootings in the 22 days since Floyd's death.
[58:14.320 --> 58:19.560]  66 people have been shot, about 45% of the total shooting victims for the year, according
[58:19.560 --> 58:21.240]  to the data from the police.
[58:21.240 --> 58:26.960]  The first week after Floyd's death, saw a record 22 gunshot victims while the following
[58:26.960 --> 58:33.880]  two weeks had 16 and 19 victims respectively, all among the top five most violent weeks
[58:33.880 --> 58:36.720]  in the city since 2016.
[58:36.720 --> 58:42.480]  And so, I guess the solution is CHAS, right?
[58:42.480 --> 58:47.640]  You know, I think as we look at CHAS, I think we ought to start calling it, they changed
[58:47.640 --> 58:53.680]  their name to chaos, not chaos, it was what it should be, to CHOP.
[58:53.680 --> 58:57.040]  But I think that we ought to call it Chazistan.
[58:57.040 --> 59:02.200]  I'm going to just go back and we can keep calling them CHAS, but call them Chazistan.
[59:02.200 --> 59:10.560]  And I think just like Pakistan is geographically separated, you know, it's split as India left
[59:10.560 --> 59:16.080]  the British Empire, you had the Muslims want to have Pakistan instead of India.
[59:16.080 --> 59:20.400]  And so, they wound up with East and West Pakistan on opposite sides of India.
[59:20.400 --> 59:25.320]  And so, I think what we ought to have here in America, we ought to just call these independent
[59:25.320 --> 59:31.600]  areas, kind of like Pakistan, we can have, they're both part of Chazistan, and we could
[59:31.600 --> 59:37.160]  have East and West Chazistan, so you could have Minneapolis be East Chazistan and Seattle
[59:37.160 --> 59:40.640]  can become West Chazistan.
[59:40.640 --> 59:47.040]  And quite frankly, I think we ought to just let these people be an example to everyone
[59:47.040 --> 59:48.640]  as to what is happening.
[59:48.640 --> 59:56.280]  I don't want to see, when you look at what is happening in Seattle, for example, and
[59:56.280 --> 1:00:04.880]  to punish some people because they didn't practice COVID rules and etiquette, the etiquette
[1:00:04.880 --> 1:00:09.400]  rules for COVID-19 coming out of the CDC, to punish them, they had their power and water
[1:00:09.400 --> 1:00:15.120]  turned off by the city, but you know, nobody has turned off the power and water for the,
[1:00:15.120 --> 1:00:17.160]  for Chazistan.
[1:00:17.160 --> 1:00:20.200]  They were talking in their documents, they had documents that they put out and said,
[1:00:20.200 --> 1:00:22.000]  you know, what do we do if they cut off our water?
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:25.200]  Well, let's see, could we drill through this?
[1:00:25.200 --> 1:00:29.200]  No, you got, anybody got something we could get through this concrete?
[1:00:29.200 --> 1:00:33.160]  Well, then what about the power lines or the sewer lines or that kind of stuff?
[1:00:33.160 --> 1:00:35.760]  You might tap in the wrong kind of water.
[1:00:35.760 --> 1:00:43.160]  I know we can fly in water bottles with drones if they surround us.
[1:00:43.160 --> 1:00:49.440]  Yeah, that's why they call it Evian, it's naive, spelled backwards.
[1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:54.440]  You know, it's absolutely ridiculous and everybody is laughing about them and I'm glad that President
[1:00:54.440 --> 1:00:58.880]  Trump hasn't done anything to force the issue because the governor of Washington and the
[1:00:58.880 --> 1:01:00.560]  mayor is all for that.
[1:01:00.560 --> 1:01:04.080]  I mean, if they wanted to do something about that, they could.
[1:01:04.080 --> 1:01:10.280]  And so let these people wallow in their own filth and they can be an object lesson to
[1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:16.280]  everybody and they should be as to what is happening with this model society that they
[1:01:16.280 --> 1:01:18.040]  want to give everybody.
[1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:24.160]  They've become a running joke and I think that they ought to be allowed to continue to illustrate
[1:01:24.160 --> 1:01:28.720]  the folly of what is happening, but we're going to talk coming up in this hour about
[1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:32.640]  America held hostage just now over three months.
[1:01:32.640 --> 1:01:38.280]  And we don't want to become Venezuela as a country.
[1:01:38.280 --> 1:01:47.120]  And unfortunately, these COVID lockdown etiquette rules are increasing and we are at risk of
[1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:48.120]  doing that.
[1:01:48.120 --> 1:01:52.040]  So I've got a couple more things to say about the Juneteenth movement that is happening right
[1:01:52.040 --> 1:01:53.040]  now.
[1:01:53.040 --> 1:01:54.720]  We're going to talk about the SCOTUS.
[1:01:54.720 --> 1:01:59.720]  The globalists want us domesticated, they want us inside our homes, watching our televisions
[1:01:59.720 --> 1:02:03.120]  and being controlled by our, quote, smartphones.
[1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:04.120]  Everybody knows this.
[1:02:04.120 --> 1:02:05.120]  It's to admit a goal.
[1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:09.480]  We've had whistleblowers from Facebook, Twitter and Google go public and say at the highest
[1:02:09.480 --> 1:02:14.960]  levels, their job is to make you neurotic, destroy your mind and take over your life.
[1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:17.360]  And now the COVID hysteria is all about that.
[1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:22.000]  I recently had a woman in the street walls with my youngest daughter and my daughter walked
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:28.360]  close to her and she said, get away six feet and gave her a super ugly look.
[1:02:28.360 --> 1:02:30.760]  This ladies and gentlemen is mental illness.
[1:02:30.760 --> 1:02:34.200]  My daughter walking four feet from some old woman is not a crime.
[1:02:34.200 --> 1:02:38.880]  The old woman's mental illness is the crime if we give in to it.
[1:02:38.880 --> 1:02:42.120]  This is total and complete mind control.
[1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:45.320]  We must expose the COVID hoax now.
[1:02:45.320 --> 1:02:47.400]  They're going to continue to clamp down using this.
[1:02:47.400 --> 1:02:49.200]  It's a UN Bill Gates plan.
[1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:52.720]  They've been proven to be criminal liars and they must be defeated.
[1:02:52.720 --> 1:03:01.320]  They must be exposed.
[1:03:01.320 --> 1:03:02.320]  You found it.
[1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:08.720]  The tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show.
[1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:27.160]  And now your host David Knight just briefly because I want to talk about the Supreme Court
[1:03:27.160 --> 1:03:34.000]  decision yesterday and Alex Jones is going to be coming up in the segment after this
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.600]  after this segment in the break.
[1:03:36.600 --> 1:03:41.960]  But real quickly, I was talking about the CEOs and how they're pushing this.
[1:03:41.960 --> 1:03:43.360]  And some of this is pretty fake.
[1:03:43.360 --> 1:03:50.320]  I mean, Jeff Bezos is out there talking about racism, feeling everybody's pain on this.
[1:03:50.320 --> 1:03:57.760]  But of course, he says as other CEOs are making this a paid holiday, he is saying don't hold
[1:03:57.760 --> 1:03:58.760]  any meetings.
[1:03:58.760 --> 1:03:59.760]  Come to work.
[1:03:59.760 --> 1:04:00.760]  You just don't hold any meetings.
[1:04:00.760 --> 1:04:01.760]  That's going to look bad.
[1:04:01.760 --> 1:04:04.040]  Uber's doing kind of the same thing.
[1:04:04.040 --> 1:04:07.040]  Uber says they're going to make Juneteenth a paid day off.
[1:04:07.040 --> 1:04:08.800]  The thing is, they don't have that many employees.
[1:04:08.800 --> 1:04:11.280]  Remember, their drivers are not officially employees.
[1:04:11.280 --> 1:04:13.880]  They're not going to be getting paid.
[1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:14.880]  They're contract workers.
[1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:18.920]  They're not taxi drivers, so don't regulate them like taxi drivers, you know, they get
[1:04:18.920 --> 1:04:19.920]  special treatment.
[1:04:19.920 --> 1:04:23.680]  They're contract workers, special treatment, all right.
[1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:28.720]  And then the political side of this, Kamala Harris is introducing a bill to make Juneteenth
[1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:29.720]  a national holiday.
[1:04:29.720 --> 1:04:31.600]  And of course, you know, why not?
[1:04:31.600 --> 1:04:34.920]  I mean, we should never have to work again.
[1:04:34.920 --> 1:04:41.120]  We have Trump and the Republicans are talking about giving people $4,000 for a family to
[1:04:41.120 --> 1:04:42.120]  take a vacation.
[1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:44.000]  I mean, you know, we just keep printing money.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:45.480]  Who needs to have a job?
[1:04:45.480 --> 1:04:47.760]  We don't need any of that stuff.
[1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:52.320]  The magic money machine in the sky, just raining cash down on us.
[1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:54.800]  You can get paid up to 50% of you.
[1:04:54.800 --> 1:04:59.440]  I don't think I've ever taken a vacation that was $8,000, but you can take up to $8,000
[1:04:59.440 --> 1:05:03.440]  and get 50% of it paid, $4,000 right there.
[1:05:03.440 --> 1:05:08.760]  So you not only have to get paid for not working, you know, universal basic income, but you
[1:05:08.760 --> 1:05:11.000]  get paid for vacationing.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:12.280]  What's not to like about this?
[1:05:12.280 --> 1:05:17.960]  I mean, let's just kick back and enjoy this while the ride lasts.
[1:05:17.960 --> 1:05:18.960]  Yeah.
[1:05:18.960 --> 1:05:26.040]  Pelosi is ordering the removal of portraits of four former House speakers from the U.S.
[1:05:26.040 --> 1:05:33.600]  Capitol for Juneteenth, late Thursday afternoon, the gold-framed portraits of four former speakers
[1:05:33.600 --> 1:05:38.040]  of the House of Representatives who shared ties to the Confederacy were removed from
[1:05:38.040 --> 1:05:40.880]  the walls of the U.S. Capitol.
[1:05:40.880 --> 1:05:46.760]  I guess, I don't know, she doesn't want any uncomfortable memories about the fact that
[1:05:46.760 --> 1:05:53.640]  Joe Biden voted to restore the citizenship of both Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis,
[1:05:53.640 --> 1:05:56.080]  the president of the Confederacy.
[1:05:56.080 --> 1:06:00.920]  Now they are both dead, and they're both Democrats.
[1:06:00.920 --> 1:06:05.560]  So they will both be voting in this coming election as well.
[1:06:05.560 --> 1:06:11.800]  I wonder who Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis will be voting for in this coming election
[1:06:11.800 --> 1:06:14.440]  with their restored citizenship.
[1:06:14.440 --> 1:06:20.760]  And of course, as we see the insanity of this, you know, even coming after people who were
[1:06:20.760 --> 1:06:29.720]  abolitionists like Matthias Baldwin, he made money, he didn't make money with slavery.
[1:06:29.720 --> 1:06:31.360]  He made money by making machines.
[1:06:31.360 --> 1:06:33.760]  He hired black people, not his slaves.
[1:06:33.760 --> 1:06:38.040]  He was the first person in the area to hire black people as employees.
[1:06:38.040 --> 1:06:45.400]  He set up schools and paid for them out of his own fortune, building locomotives.
[1:06:45.400 --> 1:06:48.880]  And they put up a statue to it.
[1:06:48.880 --> 1:06:50.760]  He did that, by the way, because he was a Christian.
[1:06:50.760 --> 1:06:54.320]  He made a lot of money, became a Christian, then he started helping black people and trying
[1:06:54.320 --> 1:06:55.320]  to abolish slavery.
[1:06:55.320 --> 1:06:56.320]  Funny how that works.
[1:06:56.320 --> 1:07:01.080]  It kind of worked that way with William Wilberforce in Britain as well.
[1:07:01.080 --> 1:07:05.400]  But no, no, no, we got to destroy all these people.
[1:07:05.400 --> 1:07:06.880]  And that's what they're doing with them.
[1:07:06.880 --> 1:07:14.880]  Now Tim Scott, a black senator from South Carolina, said the U.S. is not a racist country.
[1:07:14.880 --> 1:07:18.480]  He said some people enjoy talking about systemic racism, and they want to define everything
[1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:21.000]  from a racist perspective.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:28.560]  It is a false binary choice to have to back either black Americans or law enforcement.
[1:07:28.560 --> 1:07:30.240]  That's exactly what I was saying.
[1:07:30.240 --> 1:07:31.240]  It's exactly right.
[1:07:31.240 --> 1:07:35.360]  If we really want to change things, that's what we have to do.
[1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:44.200]  But the hatred is so engendered now that not only are they attacking white people just
[1:07:44.200 --> 1:07:51.320]  because they're white, but the visceral hatred that is being pushed by all these institutions
[1:07:51.320 --> 1:07:56.480]  now because it's not just the Democrats, it's not just the big company corporations.
[1:07:56.480 --> 1:08:02.840]  I mean, you know, popular mechanics telling people how to destroy monuments chemically.
[1:08:02.840 --> 1:08:09.440]  I had a picture sent to me by my wife of a monument that was burning because of the
[1:08:09.440 --> 1:08:11.400]  chemicals that they put on it.
[1:08:11.400 --> 1:08:13.320]  I mean, these people just destroying everything.
[1:08:13.320 --> 1:08:18.800]  And they're even going through cemeteries and digging up the remains of revolutionary
[1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:24.640]  and civil war figures, even in digging up the remains of toddlers in the ground.
[1:08:24.640 --> 1:08:32.800]  This is the insane hatred that people like Nancy Pelosi and these big corporate CEOs,
[1:08:32.800 --> 1:08:38.680]  these rich, spoiled elites who want to destroy our country, yeah, they've got their money
[1:08:38.680 --> 1:08:39.680]  and they're going to get out.
[1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:41.440]  They're going to get out to their bug out area.
[1:08:41.440 --> 1:08:46.040]  They're going to watch this place burn down and say, well, yeah, it was, it should have
[1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:49.680]  happened just like Chick-fil-A CEO said that about Wendy's.
[1:08:49.680 --> 1:08:53.040]  Oh, yeah, I can understand them burning it down.
[1:08:53.040 --> 1:08:59.280]  They want the entire country to burn down, so yeah, we got to make sure that doesn't
[1:08:59.280 --> 1:09:00.280]  happen.
[1:09:00.280 --> 1:09:04.240]  I was going to talk about sports, but I do want to get to the Supreme Court.
[1:09:04.240 --> 1:09:09.000]  I've only got about four minutes here before we go to break.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:15.400]  When we look at what happened with this process with the Supreme Court, and I have talked
[1:09:15.400 --> 1:09:23.880]  about this ever since President Trump proposed changing DACA, he was sued, and then you had
[1:09:23.880 --> 1:09:30.600]  Jeff Sessions and then Barr and the Department of Justice defend this in the courts.
[1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:35.600]  I said, you don't have to defend this.
[1:09:35.600 --> 1:09:39.840]  This is an executive order from the previous president, and that's exactly what Clarence
[1:09:39.840 --> 1:09:42.000]  Thomas is saying.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:48.160]  He says, how can you make this into something that we decide whether or not this is going
[1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:49.160]  in?
[1:09:49.160 --> 1:09:50.400]  Well, it is all political.
[1:09:50.400 --> 1:09:56.160]  When you look at the language that's being used in the headlines to talk about this, AP,
[1:09:56.160 --> 1:10:03.720]  court rejects Trump's bid, his bid, to end young immigrants protections.
[1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:04.720]  Now this is the AP.
[1:10:04.720 --> 1:10:07.960]  The AP are the people who give us their style sheets.
[1:10:07.960 --> 1:10:11.880]  The AP style sheet says you cannot refer to somebody as being pro-life.
[1:10:11.880 --> 1:10:13.720]  That is forbidden.
[1:10:13.720 --> 1:10:16.920]  You don't talk about somebody being pro-life.
[1:10:16.920 --> 1:10:23.120]  You call them pro-abortion rights, and you don't say that somebody is anti-abortion.
[1:10:23.120 --> 1:10:33.120]  They are pro-abortion rights, but pro-life person is an anti-abortionist, and that's
[1:10:33.120 --> 1:10:34.440]  what you refer to them as.
[1:10:34.440 --> 1:10:39.080]  If they are pro-abortion, you say that they are pro-abortion rights, you don't call them
[1:10:39.080 --> 1:10:40.080]  an abortionist.
[1:10:40.080 --> 1:10:43.880]  When you talk about immigration, like they're talking about here, don't use the terms aliens.
[1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:50.160]  Don't use the term illegal, so certainly don't use illegal alien, right?
[1:10:50.160 --> 1:10:52.400]  You don't call them an illegal immigrant.
[1:10:52.400 --> 1:10:53.880]  You don't even call them undocumented.
[1:10:53.880 --> 1:10:57.480]  The new style sheets from AP say don't use the term undocumented.
[1:10:57.480 --> 1:11:02.160]  You call them migrants, and you call these people dreamers, even though there was never
[1:11:02.160 --> 1:11:09.040]  a dream act, and in this article from the AP, they show a picture of Avanya Castillo holding
[1:11:09.040 --> 1:11:15.760]  a banner to show her support for Dreamer Miriam from California, and they said DACA recipients
[1:11:15.760 --> 1:11:18.320]  are celebrating in front of the U.S. Supreme Court and so forth.
[1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:22.720]  That's the way they put this, Miriam's home is here.
[1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:30.120]  Well, as Robert says, we do not decide whether DACA or its rescission are sound policies.
[1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:36.360]  We address only whether the agency complied with the procedural requirement that it provide
[1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:37.360]  a reasonable explanation.
[1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:41.360]  So you got to explain why you want to do this.
[1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:43.760]  No, you don't.
[1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:45.440]  It was an executive order.
[1:11:45.440 --> 1:11:54.040]  It was an executive order from Janet DePolitano, head of Homeland Security and the Obama administration.
[1:11:54.040 --> 1:11:57.680]  She didn't give any reason for that.
[1:11:57.680 --> 1:12:03.800]  And as one headline puts it, Judge Roberts decides that Obama is still president.
[1:12:03.800 --> 1:12:09.840]  One of the biggest problems facing this country is the fact that we no longer have the 10th
[1:12:09.840 --> 1:12:10.840]  Amendment.
[1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:11.840]  We no longer have division of power.
[1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:16.760]  We don't divide power between the central government and the states and the people.
[1:12:16.760 --> 1:12:21.800]  The founders are very concerned that we're going to have a consolidation of power.
[1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:27.440]  And that was the last thing that they wanted, because they knew that that kind of consolidation
[1:12:27.440 --> 1:12:29.320]  would destroy our freedom and liberty.
[1:12:29.320 --> 1:12:30.480]  It would breed corruption.
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:32.600]  And what have we seen?
[1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:33.600]  And it got even worse.
[1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:36.800]  Not only did they divide power between the federal government states and the people with
[1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:41.400]  the 10th Amendment, the 9th and 10th Amendment, but they also divided it within the federal
[1:12:41.400 --> 1:12:42.400]  government.
[1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:46.960]  And now you have Congress and the president pretending that the Supreme Court is supreme,
[1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:50.920]  that we have a pyramid structure, that they are at the top, these elected officials.
[1:12:50.920 --> 1:12:52.800]  We'll talk more about that.
[1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:58.880]  The United Nations is publicly depopulating Africa and many other third world sectors
[1:12:58.880 --> 1:12:59.880]  of the world.
[1:12:59.880 --> 1:13:05.600]  Bill and Melinda Gates, that control the UN WHO, openly say they want to depopulate
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:06.600]  brown people.
[1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:13.600]  It is absurdist that Apple and Google and Nike have slave factories in China, the worst
[1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:18.080]  on the planet, and then lecture white people in America how they're bad to black people.
[1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:22.640]  And now all of the world, people are taking knees and trying to overthrow police and put
[1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:24.480]  leftists in control.
[1:13:24.480 --> 1:13:27.600]  This is a totally sickening, disgusting joke.
[1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:31.600]  You ever heard the saying, keep your friends close, enemies closer?
[1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:34.440]  Leftists are evil and they divide and conquer people.
[1:13:34.440 --> 1:13:39.760]  But at the heart of them is a eugenics based depopulation operation.
[1:13:39.760 --> 1:13:44.400]  Why aren't Black Lives Matter at Cold Springs Harbor in New York, where they run the whole
[1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:46.600]  operation trying to topple statues?
[1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:48.760]  Why aren't they at the United Nations?
[1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:52.920]  Because they're controlled by the UN and being directed by their masters.
[1:13:52.920 --> 1:14:01.000]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System, the first of its kind, pure, nascent, atomic iodine
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.600]  that can be delivered through a spray bottle.
[1:14:03.600 --> 1:14:09.680]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here, introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[1:14:09.680 --> 1:14:12.840]  The great part about the X2 spray is it's great on the go.
[1:14:12.840 --> 1:14:16.920]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house, it's great at work, but this
[1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:22.080]  is great for the car, it's great to keep with you, and again, it's also good for the throat
[1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:26.200]  and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[1:14:26.200 --> 1:14:30.000]  And we're really excited about it, it's 33% off out of the gates.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:34.480]  It was Lister's idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to
[1:14:34.480 --> 1:14:38.520]  the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers
[1:14:38.520 --> 1:14:42.040]  it to the body in a new and in some ways, even better way.
[1:14:42.040 --> 1:14:48.240]  Get your Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine spray now at 33% off at infowarstore.com and
[1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:56.120]  experience the power of aerosolized X2 nascent iodine for yourself.
[1:14:56.120 --> 1:15:12.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:17.560]  Senator Josh Hawley along with Senator Cotton and others have introduced legislation to
[1:15:17.560 --> 1:15:21.720]  strip Big Tech of Section 230 immunity.
[1:15:21.720 --> 1:15:27.880]  Now this is cut and dry because Google, Facebook, Twitter, all of them have been busy using
[1:15:27.880 --> 1:15:34.800]  Section 230 to give themselves complete immunity from third party content on their platforms.
[1:15:34.800 --> 1:15:39.760]  But Facebook particularly, but also Google, Apple, they all do it.
[1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:46.200]  They have been going in and telling people to have an app with them or have a website
[1:15:46.200 --> 1:15:47.800]  on their platform.
[1:15:47.800 --> 1:15:52.760]  You name it that if any one of the comments says anything that the ADL doesn't approve
[1:15:52.760 --> 1:15:57.800]  of, and that's actually the arbiter, the judge, jury, the executioner, the gods up on Mount
[1:15:57.800 --> 1:16:00.000]  Olympus, that then you will be de-platformed.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:05.800]  If you go back to last year when we were, quote, banned again, Zuckerberg said, Jones
[1:16:05.800 --> 1:16:08.720]  has people saying bad things in his comment sections.
[1:16:08.720 --> 1:16:12.520]  Now, obviously that begs the question, somebody could go in there and stage that and it turns
[1:16:12.520 --> 1:16:16.760]  out a lot of it is staged and a lot of internal documents came out of Facebook that indeed
[1:16:16.760 --> 1:16:17.760]  that's going on.
[1:16:17.760 --> 1:16:21.280]  But regardless, that's third party content.
[1:16:21.280 --> 1:16:23.280]  That's people saying things in the comment section.
[1:16:23.280 --> 1:16:28.120]  And in fact, in the first Facebook report that came out and leaked, they were talking
[1:16:28.120 --> 1:16:33.200]  about, well, it's actually a very low percentage of the comments or races.
[1:16:33.200 --> 1:16:36.120]  So we need to get a higher percentage out.
[1:16:36.120 --> 1:16:37.120]  And then we'll ban it.
[1:16:37.120 --> 1:16:41.680]  Well, once that was put in all the newspapers, the left then went registered as right wingers
[1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:46.640]  and started spewing leftist, you know, Jesse Smollett, false flags and got us removed.
[1:16:46.640 --> 1:16:51.920]  So this whole thing is completely rigged, the council that Zuckerberg set up earlier
[1:16:51.920 --> 1:16:55.040]  this year that will decide what to censor and what not to censor.
[1:16:55.040 --> 1:16:57.080]  It's all a complete joke.
[1:16:57.080 --> 1:17:03.760]  And the fact that Zero Hedge and the Federalists have broken the dam on this, where again,
[1:17:03.760 --> 1:17:08.400]  they're being banned for the comments that were made is a day late and a dollar short.
[1:17:08.400 --> 1:17:13.640]  Trump needs to act a year ago, two years ago on this, but there's still time.
[1:17:13.640 --> 1:17:18.880]  But the fact that Google acts like they're being objective and acts like that this was
[1:17:18.880 --> 1:17:23.160]  oh, an accident with the Federalist, but with Zero Hedge, we're still going to keep them
[1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:28.960]  banned because their comments is just indicative of how brazen and arrogant these institutions
[1:17:28.960 --> 1:17:29.960]  and organizations are.
[1:17:29.960 --> 1:17:37.520]  But the bigger issue is how NBC News was working with this left wing, Soros, ADL affiliated
[1:17:37.520 --> 1:17:42.960]  group to then come out and certify the Federalist and Zero Hedge as these hate platforms.
[1:17:42.960 --> 1:17:47.240]  That's how it works is you have the Southern Primary Law Center, ADL, Media Matters and
[1:17:47.240 --> 1:17:55.720]  Snopes and the Soros funded, DNC funded, publicly funded by them, a constellation of master
[1:17:55.720 --> 1:18:00.480]  censor, secret police, and hundreds of thousands of them have been trained, they're actually
[1:18:00.480 --> 1:18:07.640]  paid to be interfaced in Twitter, in Facebook, in Google, in Apple, in your private files,
[1:18:07.640 --> 1:18:11.960]  in your accounts, in your cloud, in your private messages, monitoring you.
[1:18:11.960 --> 1:18:16.080]  This has all been publicly said, Microsoft is also involved in NewsGuard, this is the
[1:18:16.080 --> 1:18:17.080]  next level.
[1:18:17.080 --> 1:18:21.720]  Okay, so the real big issue here is, neither the censorship, what is totally cut and dried
[1:18:21.720 --> 1:18:26.520]  even beyond that, because the censorship is absolutely clear as well, is the lying to
[1:18:26.520 --> 1:18:30.520]  Congress about the censorship, but more importantly, lying to Congress about the surveillance.
[1:18:30.520 --> 1:18:33.960]  Remember, Google and others have gotten up and said they don't track users, this is like
[1:18:33.960 --> 1:18:35.480]  saying water isn't wet.
[1:18:35.480 --> 1:18:40.240]  So the fact that they have let third party groups in, the surveillance spy and then they
[1:18:40.240 --> 1:18:46.880]  certify that you're evil in this special Soviet style secret court, and then that's
[1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:53.240]  used to then go out and have you banned and restricted by the big tech platforms.
[1:18:53.240 --> 1:18:56.880]  So what's happening is the ADL, the Southern Prairie Law Center and others, they admit
[1:18:56.880 --> 1:19:00.200]  they want people arrested that don't follow their orders.
[1:19:00.200 --> 1:19:04.800]  They want Mark Zuckerberg, as Sacha Berco and said earlier this year, arrested unless
[1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:06.120]  he fully submits to them.
[1:19:06.120 --> 1:19:15.400]  This is beyond mind control, beyond the cult, this is Hitlerian, Stalinistic, Maoistic control,
[1:19:15.400 --> 1:19:19.840]  and now it's really coming out in everybody's face that you're being watched in lifetime,
[1:19:19.840 --> 1:19:24.640]  AI is controlling what you do, it was always built from the beginning to abuse you and
[1:19:24.640 --> 1:19:30.040]  to control you, one ring to bind them all, one ring to enslave them, one ring to bring
[1:19:30.040 --> 1:19:33.240]  in their new world order, and that's what this AI system has been built to do from
[1:19:33.240 --> 1:19:37.880]  the beginning, it's total global, absolute hegemonic domination.
[1:19:37.880 --> 1:19:42.160]  So everybody asked when I first got banned two and a half years ago and was used as the
[1:19:42.160 --> 1:19:48.020]  big example how I was feeling, and I said how am I feeling, they're coming for everyone.
[1:19:48.020 --> 1:19:54.040]  This is AI control because they were bragging about it at the time, Skelter was on TV with
[1:19:54.040 --> 1:19:59.520]  Oliver Darcy saying soon we'll control the text messages they can send each other individually.
[1:19:59.520 --> 1:20:01.880]  They were telling everyone that was the goal.
[1:20:01.880 --> 1:20:06.720]  So imagine, these are media organizations working with these third party fake watchdog
[1:20:06.720 --> 1:20:12.480]  political groups, DNC funded, literally coming in together and trying to shut down their
[1:20:12.480 --> 1:20:16.920]  competition and now they're expanding out to the general public, oh you said some things
[1:20:16.920 --> 1:20:21.360]  we didn't like on Facebook or Twitter, now your credit rating's gone down, now you can't
[1:20:21.360 --> 1:20:27.120]  have a bank account, now you can't have this digital wallet, this is the social credit
[1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:31.760]  score on steroids being implemented and deployed right now.
[1:20:31.760 --> 1:20:34.680]  So I'm on quasi vacation, a lot of people have been calling me saying why don't you
[1:20:34.680 --> 1:20:39.160]  respond to this yet, it's kind of like a caller saying hey we talked about the Federal Reserve
[1:20:39.160 --> 1:20:42.760]  being private, I've been talking about it 26 years, or hey you want to talk about the
[1:20:42.760 --> 1:20:48.720]  censorship, we're on top of it, we're at the center of it, and quite frankly I've moved
[1:20:48.720 --> 1:20:52.400]  on to trying to stop the nanoparticles they're adding to vaccines that are confirmed that
[1:20:52.400 --> 1:20:56.800]  reprogram your brain, I mean we're so much further down the line now folks that people
[1:20:56.800 --> 1:21:01.600]  haven't woken up to this by now, there's no helping you, big tech is your enemy, big corporations
[1:21:01.600 --> 1:21:05.720]  are your enemy, they're cold blooded, they're on a power trip, they have a plan for the
[1:21:05.720 --> 1:21:10.080]  future and we're not in it, it's very very simple, we are seen as meat on the table of
[1:21:10.080 --> 1:21:14.440]  the globalist, we are seen as lower than animals, what they're teaching is that animals are
[1:21:14.440 --> 1:21:19.960]  superior to us so that they can control us and take our rights, do you understand they're
[1:21:19.960 --> 1:21:24.960]  creating humanoid animal human clones for 30 years, they're mad scientists, we're all
[1:21:24.960 --> 1:21:28.040]  in grave grave grave danger.
[1:21:28.040 --> 1:21:34.800]  Alright that was Alex Jones and he's in Washington D.C. they're picking him as the
[1:21:34.800 --> 1:21:41.240]  new press secretary, not really, that's a joke, an old joke coming from Babylon B. Backman,
[1:21:41.240 --> 1:21:48.920]  Sean Spicer resigned, they put out a parody, Trump picks Alex Jones as new press secretary,
[1:21:48.920 --> 1:21:53.200]  well that would be an improvement actually because we do support free speech here, we're
[1:21:53.200 --> 1:21:59.440]  not afraid to tell you what we think and to argue why we think that's true and if you
[1:21:59.440 --> 1:22:04.600]  don't agree with this that's fine, that used to be what free speech was about, not making
[1:22:04.600 --> 1:22:09.480]  sure that you manage it for whatever phony agenda, you don't want to hurt somebody's
[1:22:09.480 --> 1:22:13.880]  feelings, no no no, it was never about that and if that's going to be the standard you
[1:22:13.880 --> 1:22:19.080]  will never have free speech, it's the freedom to offend quite frankly is what free speech
[1:22:19.080 --> 1:22:23.560]  is based on. The Federalist, one of the two organizations that Alex was just talking about
[1:22:23.560 --> 1:22:30.680]  that was targeted by Google for extinction, as they pointed out it's a former Google engineer
[1:22:30.680 --> 1:22:35.640]  that says Google's claims of no partisan bias are hogwash and of course we have seen that
[1:22:35.640 --> 1:22:41.760]  many many times, we've had Project Veritas have whistleblowers, they've also talked to
[1:22:41.760 --> 1:22:48.200]  people who work for Google and as they point out it's kind of surreal to find out from
[1:22:48.200 --> 1:22:55.440]  NBC and not from Google that Google is going to demonetize you, while we had CNN devote
[1:22:55.440 --> 1:23:00.520]  its time to trying to get rid of info wars, so now NBC has taken on that task for both
[1:23:00.520 --> 1:23:06.080]  the zero hedge and for the Federalist, they came back and walked that back after people
[1:23:06.080 --> 1:23:13.840]  started complaining about that, but of course this is something that is rolling out everywhere
[1:23:13.840 --> 1:23:17.800]  and there's two things about this, you know I keep seeing a lot of these now that it's
[1:23:17.800 --> 1:23:23.760]  getting into more mainstream conservative publications like the Federalist, people are
[1:23:23.760 --> 1:23:29.560]  starting to push back against this somewhat, even though the libertarian and conservative
[1:23:29.560 --> 1:23:34.280]  think tanks have said oh it's just private they can do whatever they want as I said before,

[1:26:54.040 --> 1:27:21.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show, but I want to say thank you to you. I haven't
[1:27:21.240 --> 1:27:27.400]  had an orthodox career and I've wanted more than anything to have your respect. The first
[1:27:27.400 --> 1:27:33.080]  time I didn't feel it, but this time I feel it and I can't deny the fact that you like
[1:27:33.080 --> 1:27:36.920]  me right now. You like me.
[1:27:36.920 --> 1:27:45.560]  You're so excited. She really felt it the second time she got me asked her that you
[1:27:45.560 --> 1:27:49.520]  like me, you really like me. Well, you know, President Trump has now been rejected twice
[1:27:49.520 --> 1:27:55.120]  this week by the Supreme Court and he said, they don't like me. They really don't like
[1:27:55.120 --> 1:28:01.560]  me two times in one week. First time it didn't really hit with him, but this time when they
[1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:06.440]  say, well, you're not president, Obama is president, his executive orders are what we're
[1:28:06.440 --> 1:28:11.880]  going to go by. He comes back. They really don't like me. And he retweeted Claire's
[1:28:11.880 --> 1:28:16.560]  Thomas who said the decision is quote, an effort to avoid a politically controversial
[1:28:16.560 --> 1:28:24.560]  but legally correct decision. Look, this isn't about President Trump. What the Supreme Court
[1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:28.960]  doesn't like is division of power, separation of powers. What the Supreme Court doesn't
[1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:35.840]  like is the Bill of Rights, especially the 9th and 10th Amendment. They want to be the
[1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:41.200]  sole arbiters of everything that happens in this country. And of course, it's always
[1:28:41.200 --> 1:28:49.880]  going to happen like that when you have careers bureaucrats like Roberts after what Gorsuch
[1:28:49.880 --> 1:29:00.080]  did this last week, reading into the 1964 Civil Rights Act, reading in LGBT anti-discrimination
[1:29:00.080 --> 1:29:06.320]  rules for transgenders and so forth. I said, can we finally get rid of this idea that the
[1:29:06.320 --> 1:29:13.240]  way to fix this country is through Washington? Washington is the problem. It's not the solution.
[1:29:13.240 --> 1:29:18.000]  Remember Reagan saying that he was right about that. And the biggest problem in Washington
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:25.080]  is the Supreme Court or maybe it's the rest of the government in Washington and in the
[1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:30.360]  various states that bow down to the pronouncements of the Supreme Court. The Constitution is not
[1:29:30.360 --> 1:29:36.960]  a self-enforcing document. You have to stand up for your rights. But when I talked about
[1:29:36.960 --> 1:29:43.560]  Gorsuch going off the rails of the Constitution, what doesn't have anything to do with what
[1:29:43.560 --> 1:29:48.760]  the text actually says, we don't care about that. We were told that Gorsuch was going
[1:29:48.760 --> 1:29:55.160]  to be in the tradition of Scalia and so forth and he was going to be an originalist, a textualist
[1:29:55.160 --> 1:30:01.320]  and so forth. No, no, no. They just read into whatever they want. And I said, I hope we
[1:30:01.320 --> 1:30:09.080]  can get over this naive idea that has now been disproven just with Roe v. Wade, for example.
[1:30:09.080 --> 1:30:14.920]  The idea, regardless of what you think about this, the idea that the Supreme Court would
[1:30:14.920 --> 1:30:21.520]  presume to say when life begins and so forth or that they would presume that they had the
[1:30:21.520 --> 1:30:27.200]  authority to define marriage, regardless of what their definition is, or that they would
[1:30:27.200 --> 1:30:32.120]  talk about DACA or Obamacare. I mean, you've got Judge Roberts writing both sides of the
[1:30:32.120 --> 1:30:38.040]  Obamacare decision. I mean, who's blackmailing this guy? That was absolutely amazing. Or
[1:30:38.040 --> 1:30:45.120]  what they've done with the drug wars. Regardless of what you think about DACA, you ought to
[1:30:45.120 --> 1:30:52.920]  be outraged by their logic here because this is nothing but judicial tyranny. It's not
[1:30:52.920 --> 1:30:58.960]  simply judicial supremacy, but it is the tyranny that always follows when you have consolidated,
[1:30:58.960 --> 1:31:04.040]  completely consolidated your power. And so I said, I hope that conservatives can get
[1:31:04.040 --> 1:31:10.320]  over this naive idea that by electing a Republican president, we're going to get good Supreme
[1:31:10.320 --> 1:31:16.080]  Court justices, and it never works. It works for the Democrats because it's pretty easy
[1:31:16.080 --> 1:31:25.360]  to find Democrats who are going to be statists when you pick from a pool of career bureaucrats.
[1:31:25.360 --> 1:31:31.120]  But when you pick as a Republican president, when you have to pick from a pool of career
[1:31:31.120 --> 1:31:38.840]  bureaucrats, they typically go sell. Now, Clarence Thomas is an exception, but he really
[1:31:38.840 --> 1:31:44.400]  is the exception. Most of them are just died in the wool status. And again, Clarence Thomas,
[1:31:44.400 --> 1:31:50.320]  the thing that Biden was furious about, Biden led the opposition to Clarence Thomas. And
[1:31:50.320 --> 1:31:55.520]  Biden was furious about the fact that Clarence Thomas had written about natural rights. Clarence
[1:31:55.520 --> 1:32:03.240]  Thomas understands the Declaration of Independence. He agrees with the principle that we have
[1:32:03.240 --> 1:32:09.520]  fundamental human rights that transcend and are there before the government hands them
[1:32:09.520 --> 1:32:14.880]  out to us as privileges. And Biden was furious about that. The left still hasn't forgiven
[1:32:14.880 --> 1:32:19.800]  Biden because he didn't come after Clarence Thomas more for the, he said, she said, accusations
[1:32:19.800 --> 1:32:28.440]  of Anita Hill. But of course, those are phony as well. All of these pseudo feminists, including
[1:32:28.440 --> 1:32:34.000]  Anita Hill, within a couple of years, were attacking the victims of Bill Clinton, calling
[1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:42.520]  them bimbos, saying they deserved it. I mean, what he was accused of, credibly accused of
[1:32:42.520 --> 1:32:49.200]  with Anita Broderick and other people, violent sexual assault and rape. There were no credible
[1:32:49.200 --> 1:32:55.560]  statements made by Anita Hill. Nobody witnessed anything untoward. And what she accused Clarence
[1:32:55.560 --> 1:32:59.240]  Thomas of was nothing. But what Biden was concerned about was the idea that he would
[1:32:59.240 --> 1:33:06.640]  support, have the audacity to support natural rights. Nevertheless, President Trump is saying,
[1:33:06.640 --> 1:33:10.520]  we need more justices or we will lose our second amendment and everything else. Vote
[1:33:10.520 --> 1:33:20.280]  Trump 2020. No, that isn't going to do it. Let me tell you what is going to do it. You
[1:33:20.280 --> 1:33:27.680]  know, a lot has been spoken about President Trump and comparisons that he's made to Andrew
[1:33:27.680 --> 1:33:33.840]  Jackson. From the very beginning, he put a portrait of Andrew Jackson in the Oval Office
[1:33:33.840 --> 1:33:38.720]  and so forth. And so a lot of people criticize him for that. Trump is the first president
[1:33:38.720 --> 1:33:44.420]  to visit Andrew Jackson's grave since Ronald Reagan. Trump called pulling Andrew Jackson
[1:33:44.420 --> 1:33:49.000]  from the $20 bill pure political correctness. He was right about all that stuff, quite frankly.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:54.160]  Nevertheless, you know, when you go back and you look in, you know, the populist background
[1:33:54.160 --> 1:33:59.320]  of Andrew Jackson and so forth. But let me tell you, I know Andrew Jackson and President
[1:33:59.320 --> 1:34:07.800]  Trump is no Andrew Jackson because even though Andrew Jackson forced the trail of tears and
[1:34:07.800 --> 1:34:18.920]  I absolutely disagree with what he did. But he had the authority to do it. When he pushed
[1:34:18.920 --> 1:34:25.280]  through the what is known as a trail of tears, he pushed the Cherokee Indians out west, forced
[1:34:25.280 --> 1:34:30.840]  them to relocate to Oklahoma. This estimated between two and six million Cherokee people
[1:34:30.840 --> 1:34:36.440]  died during the forced relocation. It was a horrible, horrible thing. Now, the Supreme
[1:34:36.440 --> 1:34:41.960]  Court had said a year earlier, well, you can do that. And then they changed their mind
[1:34:41.960 --> 1:34:47.400]  and said you can't. Now, Andrew Jackson understood that there's a separation of power. They didn't
[1:34:47.400 --> 1:34:52.240]  have any ability to do that. He said, well, they've issued their opinion. Let's see them
[1:34:52.240 --> 1:34:59.200]  enforce it. And he was absolutely right about the fact that he had the authority to do that,
[1:34:59.200 --> 1:35:02.360]  even though his policy was absolutely wrong. And that's why I say, regardless of what you
[1:35:02.360 --> 1:35:07.720]  think about DACA or about marriage or what you think about abortion, you want to pay
[1:35:07.720 --> 1:35:16.000]  attention to the fact that we are becoming a dictatorship of politically appointed judges
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:20.240]  and what they're doing to this country. We don't want to have a system like that. You
[1:35:20.240 --> 1:35:23.920]  don't want to have a system like that if you want to have any liberty. So above and beyond
[1:35:23.920 --> 1:35:29.560]  the issue, take a look at what these people did and how the press is cheering this. Oh,
[1:35:29.560 --> 1:35:35.280]  it was Trump's bid. Oh, they blocked Trump from doing this. And again, Roberts is saying,
[1:35:35.280 --> 1:35:39.040]  well, we don't like the way that you did this. And he joined the liberals, except that he
[1:35:39.040 --> 1:35:47.720]  joined the liberals completely a long time ago. Yeah, he does not believe anything that
[1:35:47.720 --> 1:35:52.320]  yeah, he was appointed by George W. Bush, a Republican. And one of the reasons that we're
[1:35:52.320 --> 1:35:55.560]  supposed to vote for George W. Bush. Remember they told everybody, oh, you got to vote for
[1:35:55.560 --> 1:35:59.560]  him because he's going to put in people in the Supreme Court and judge Roberts. Oh, he's
[1:35:59.560 --> 1:36:03.840]  great. Made him Chief Justice. He's going to be there for a long time. That's it. Five
[1:36:03.840 --> 1:36:11.480]  four majority. He joined Gensburg, Kagan, Breyer, Sotomayor, saying that the president cannot
[1:36:11.480 --> 1:36:19.920]  get rid of the executive order of Barack Obama and dissent. Clarence Justice said the court
[1:36:19.920 --> 1:36:26.480]  is making a huge mistake. He said that you're doing this. The president Trump did it the
[1:36:26.480 --> 1:36:32.160]  same way the Obama administration did it unilaterally and through a memorandum. It's an executive
[1:36:32.160 --> 1:36:36.920]  order. So what they're saying is that this is this administration cannot repeal the executive
[1:36:36.920 --> 1:36:40.760]  order of the previous one. Or as another person said, they think that Obama is still present.
[1:36:40.760 --> 1:36:54.040]  We'll be right back. Stay with us. We're already to the latter part of June. And of course,
[1:36:54.040 --> 1:36:59.640]  most of the country is not completely reopened again. Already foushee and the UN billable
[1:36:59.640 --> 1:37:05.280]  indicates criminal combiner telling us don't go to Trump rallies. Oh, no. But the very same
[1:37:05.280 --> 1:37:09.760]  media that promotes that we shouldn't go to Trump rallies is telling us we should go to
[1:37:09.760 --> 1:37:15.520]  the Democrat Party Black Lives Matter. All white people are evil. Mind control, brainwashing
[1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:21.080]  events. This is the attempted murder of common sense and logic. Ladies and gentlemen, now
[1:37:21.080 --> 1:37:26.160]  is the time to be more politically active than you ever have because we are going into
[1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:32.000]  a hardcore United Nations controlled bondage. Major police departments like Los Angeles
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:35.960]  and Albuquerque, New Mexico are announcing they're going under UN control and turning
[1:37:35.960 --> 1:37:41.680]  their quote police into community activist organizers. This is just the beginning. Everything's
[1:37:41.680 --> 1:37:46.600]  going to accelerate now from this point out. So it's here. No more games. The new world
[1:37:46.600 --> 1:37:56.120]  order has arrived. David Rockefeller and other satanic pieces of garbage who thought they
[1:37:56.120 --> 1:38:02.640]  could set up their world government. Believe they pulled the drain on America a long time
[1:38:02.640 --> 1:38:12.480]  ago. But if we understand that they've orchestrated this by design, and if there's a mass awakening,
[1:38:12.480 --> 1:38:18.720]  it can be their unraveling, their destruction, and them going down the drain. The Bible tells
[1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:23.760]  us that many times when the enemy digs a pit for us, they themselves fall into it. But
[1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:28.600]  God is the master of the universe but gives us free will and this plan is a test. It is
[1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:33.760]  up to us to decide whether we're going down the drain or whether the globalists are going
[1:38:33.760 --> 1:38:38.000]  down the drain. I cannot express to listeners and viewers of this broadcast how important
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:44.880]  you are. Everything hinges on you. Everything peacefully become the Paul Revere you know
[1:38:44.880 --> 1:38:50.960]  you've always been. God bless and good luck.
[1:38:50.960 --> 1:38:55.440]  I was talking to my Patriots supplier, great suppliers. You can now say four weeks on average
[1:38:55.440 --> 1:39:01.160]  for storeable food. It's the highest quality. They've got it. Use this little rest we have
[1:39:01.160 --> 1:39:05.160]  caught in the current to come up to the service. Get some air before you get sucked back down.
[1:39:05.160 --> 1:39:10.240]  I personally am ordering more storeable food. I have to now start going into defense posture.
[1:39:10.240 --> 1:39:15.960]  80% offense but I've always been 100% offense trying to fully you know stop the globalists
[1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:21.080]  and we've given them a good run and I think down the road they'll be defeated but we're
[1:39:21.080 --> 1:39:24.640]  going to still go down the hard road now. There were a lot worse roads we'd probably
[1:39:24.640 --> 1:39:29.320]  go down but we've mitigated some of this but it's still going to be bad in my view. You
[1:39:29.320 --> 1:39:32.720]  need to get high quality storeable food. It's something you need. We have high quality
[1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:36.680]  ready to get out to you and it supports the broadcast and 360 wins so please take care
[1:39:36.680 --> 1:39:42.520]  of your storeable foods. Needs at infowarstore.com and get your orders in now so you get it, so
[1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:46.880]  you have it, it's in great containers, high quality. Last 25 years, get it while you can
[1:39:46.880 --> 1:39:49.760]  because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[1:39:49.760 --> 1:39:54.360]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:39:54.360 --> 1:39:55.360]  Hello, can you hear me?
[1:39:55.360 --> 1:39:56.360]  I sure can sir. Thank you.
[1:39:56.360 --> 1:40:01.920]  Hey Alex, before I start man, I just wanted to talk to you bro and it's a pleasure to
[1:40:01.920 --> 1:40:03.240]  be talking right now here man.
[1:40:03.240 --> 1:40:04.720]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you brother.
[1:40:04.720 --> 1:40:10.000]  I'm from New Brin, Connecticut and I just want to plug in. I'm a truck driver and two
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:15.600]  before us have changed the way I drive. Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple
[1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:23.440]  of us. We are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans. We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and
[1:40:23.440 --> 1:40:27.640]  Rolla and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to
[1:40:27.640 --> 1:40:28.640]  thank you for that man.
[1:40:28.640 --> 1:40:33.200]  Well brother, we put more in this than any other long term high quality energy powder
[1:40:33.200 --> 1:40:36.880]  there is. So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country. He didn't want his
[1:40:36.880 --> 1:40:40.040]  name on it because obviously the political issues but we had to pay a lot of money for
[1:40:40.040 --> 1:40:43.760]  this formulation just for the design of it and we believe it is the best, strongest
[1:40:43.760 --> 1:40:47.560]  but healthiest energy out there and you're saying that it's made your life better so
[1:40:47.560 --> 1:40:53.520]  that means a lot to me. Thank you to all your truck drivers. We love you.
[1:40:53.520 --> 1:41:10.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:10.520 --> 1:41:35.320]  All right, before I leave this Supreme Court decision about DACA and again I've been talking
[1:41:35.320 --> 1:41:40.680]  about this a long time. I had Roy Moore on because Roy Moore was saying there is no such
[1:41:40.680 --> 1:41:47.560]  thing as a dreamer. You've had multiple attempts by the Democrats to pass the DREAM Act. They
[1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:55.320]  never did. Therefore there are no dreamers. You had Barack Obama's Homeland Security,
[1:41:55.320 --> 1:42:03.640]  a director or whatever she was called Janet Napolitano, put out a memo saying we're not
[1:42:03.640 --> 1:42:07.640]  going to enforce the law that we swore to uphold with the Constitution. We took our
[1:42:07.640 --> 1:42:12.400]  oath of the Constitution and swore to uphold the laws but we're not going to do that. Deferred
[1:42:12.400 --> 1:42:22.800]  action on childhood arrivals. Again, we had the legal fiction of anchor babies and since
[1:42:22.800 --> 1:42:30.360]  we're talking about Juneteenth and so forth, this is Juneteenth, it was June the 19th,
[1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:35.880]  1965 you had a union general go to Galveston and tell the slaves that they were free. And
[1:42:35.880 --> 1:42:40.720]  the press will say even though Abraham Lincoln passed the Emancipation Proclamation two years
[1:42:40.720 --> 1:42:48.360]  earlier, well read the Emancipation Proclamation and it didn't free a single slave. It said
[1:42:48.360 --> 1:42:57.000]  that if we read the slaves under union control and not and specifically mentioned the states
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:04.720]  and did not free any slaves that were under the control of the Confederacy. And he was
[1:43:04.720 --> 1:43:10.320]  doing that because he was holding that out as a negotiating tactic to the Confederacy
[1:43:10.320 --> 1:43:16.440]  saying if you will come back into the union and renounce your right to secession and self-government,
[1:43:16.440 --> 1:43:23.840]  we will let you keep slavery as an institution. And they said no. We've stopped the slave
[1:43:23.840 --> 1:43:27.600]  trade and we're going to get rid of the institution of slavery but we're not going to give up
[1:43:27.600 --> 1:43:32.720]  our independence. And so the Emancipation Proclamation did not free anybody. When they
[1:43:32.720 --> 1:43:37.400]  announced it on Juneteenth, that is now being celebrated as the holiday. But what freed them
[1:43:37.400 --> 1:43:45.920]  was the 14th Amendment. But the 14th Amendment is being misused to support the idea of anchor
[1:43:45.920 --> 1:43:51.640]  babies. Now the 14th Amendment says that as it made slaves, citizens made it very clear
[1:43:51.640 --> 1:43:56.440]  if you're born here in America under subject to the jurisdiction of America, if your parents
[1:43:56.440 --> 1:44:05.160]  are subject to the jurisdiction. If you are an alien, a foreigner, an illegal immigrant,
[1:44:05.160 --> 1:44:08.720]  an illegal alien, you are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and so your
[1:44:08.720 --> 1:44:13.600]  kids are not American citizens if you read the 14th Amendment. But that's the fiction
[1:44:13.600 --> 1:44:18.720]  that they've created, the anchor baby. Obama took it another level. And what they said
[1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:25.520]  was, well, if you came here, you weren't born here, but you came here before a certain age
[1:44:25.520 --> 1:44:31.320]  and that age is actually a lot older than you may think. He said, we're going to count
[1:44:31.320 --> 1:44:36.640]  you and treat you as if you were citizens. And then they tried to push through the same
[1:44:36.640 --> 1:44:45.120]  thing for parents who brought their kids here illegally. That was stopped. And yet this
[1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:53.280]  executive order, Roberts says, cannot be changed. And this is nothing other than a political
[1:44:53.280 --> 1:45:00.680]  maneuver. As Clarence Thomas pointed out, he said, the majority has decided to prolong
[1:45:00.680 --> 1:45:08.240]  DHS's initial overreach by providing a stopgap measure of its own. In doing so, the Supreme
[1:45:08.240 --> 1:45:13.080]  Court has given the green light for future political battles to be fought in this court
[1:45:13.080 --> 1:45:18.160]  rather than where they rightfully belong, the political branches. Such timidity forsakes
[1:45:18.160 --> 1:45:22.880]  the court's duty to apply the law according to neutral principles. And the ripple effect
[1:45:22.880 --> 1:45:28.640]  of the majority's error will be felt throughout our system of self-government. Clarence Thomas
[1:45:28.640 --> 1:45:35.880]  goes on to say, under the auspices of today's decision, administrations can bind their successors
[1:45:35.880 --> 1:45:41.920]  by unlawfully adopting significant legal changes through executive branch agency memoranda.
[1:45:41.920 --> 1:45:48.880]  Even if the agency lacked authority to effectuate the changes. Understand? Janet Napolitano
[1:45:48.880 --> 1:45:52.840]  at the Department of Homeland Security, her duty was to enforce the law. She didn't have
[1:45:52.840 --> 1:45:57.480]  the authority to say, well, we're going to not enforce the law to a whole class of people.
[1:45:57.480 --> 1:46:06.400]  But they did it. And even though they ignored their legal responsibility and violated the
[1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:13.320]  law, he said the changes cannot be undone by the same agency and successive administration
[1:46:13.320 --> 1:46:20.840]  unless the successor provides sufficient policy justifications that satisfy this court. And
[1:46:20.840 --> 1:46:25.160]  we have seen this over and over again through the Trump administration. When President Trump
[1:46:25.160 --> 1:46:31.800]  put in the immigration restrictions on those seven countries, five of them were Muslim,
[1:46:31.800 --> 1:46:39.040]  two of them were not. By the way, you can look this up. Look it up on Wikipedia. Venezuela
[1:46:39.040 --> 1:46:46.400]  is not Islamic and neither is North Korea. That's a fact. Believe it. I know. I'm telling
[1:46:46.400 --> 1:46:50.680]  you this, but you can look it up for yourself. Venezuela and North Korea are not Muslim
[1:46:50.680 --> 1:46:55.440]  countries. It was not a Muslim ban. Even though there were five countries there, these are
[1:46:55.440 --> 1:47:00.200]  countries for the most part that Obama had gone to war with and was still fighting for
[1:47:00.200 --> 1:47:06.080]  the most part. There are 50 predominantly Muslim countries. So if you say that 10 percent
[1:47:06.080 --> 1:47:10.520]  of those you can't have immigration from, that is not a Muslim ban. And nevertheless,
[1:47:10.520 --> 1:47:14.640]  you had judges who said, well, it doesn't say that he doesn't like Muslims and he wants
[1:47:14.640 --> 1:47:19.240]  to ban Muslims, but I know how this guy feels. And I'm just certain that that's why he did
[1:47:19.240 --> 1:47:27.280]  it. It doesn't matter what you think his motivations were. The law is what matters. And yet the
[1:47:27.280 --> 1:47:36.400]  law doesn't matter to Gorsuch because he read transgender law. And this is opened up. This
[1:47:36.400 --> 1:47:42.800]  is going to open up one legal fight after the other as transgenders are going to be
[1:47:42.800 --> 1:47:47.880]  suing churches that don't hire them, schools that don't hire them, places where they don't
[1:47:47.880 --> 1:47:51.920]  have the kind of restrooms that they want and so forth. Tom Cotton has said, if the
[1:47:51.920 --> 1:47:56.920]  Chief Justice Roberts believes his political judgment is so exquisite, I invite him to
[1:47:56.920 --> 1:48:02.120]  resign, travel to Iowa and get elected. Ted Cruz said, judging is not a game. It's not
[1:48:02.120 --> 1:48:05.560]  supposed to be a game. But sadly, over the recent years, more and more Chief Justice
[1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:10.880]  Roberts has been playing games to the court to achieve the policy outcomes that he desires.
[1:48:10.880 --> 1:48:17.600]  And then he had Marco Rubio, little Marco. He said the Supreme Court increasingly appears
[1:48:17.600 --> 1:48:26.000]  to be legislating. Well, I tell you, that guy, you know, in the wake of Info Wars being banned
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:31.160]  the beginning of August of a social media, they all moved within like a 12 hour period
[1:48:31.160 --> 1:48:37.320]  of ban, all the different programs and social media. And Alex went to the Alex Jones went
[1:48:37.320 --> 1:48:41.520]  to the hearings that they were having in Washington. He saw Marco Rubio there in the
[1:48:41.520 --> 1:48:46.120]  hallway and Marco Rubio pretended that he didn't know even though it's like the top
[1:48:46.120 --> 1:48:51.160]  news story globally. I even met somebody at a conference I was speaking at. It was from
[1:48:51.160 --> 1:48:57.880]  Spain didn't speak English. But when I said, yeah, I, you know, I work for Info Wars for
[1:48:57.880 --> 1:49:05.560]  Alex Jones, he goes, oh, Alex, oh, CC. But Marco Rubio didn't know. He didn't know that
[1:49:05.560 --> 1:49:11.280]  later he admitted he was lying. But he says, oh, he just now appears to realize that the
[1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:16.280]  Supreme Court appears to be legislating from the bench. And he says it's concerning. But
[1:49:16.280 --> 1:49:22.160]  of course he's not going to do anything about it. And until we get a president who is going
[1:49:22.160 --> 1:49:28.680]  to act like Andrew Jackson and not just post his pictures, and to say we have division
[1:49:28.680 --> 1:49:34.520]  of power, and we're going to act on that, it's going to continue to get worse. And they're
[1:49:34.520 --> 1:49:38.880]  going to continue to do this about everything. They're going to just be, you know, nine little
[1:49:38.880 --> 1:49:44.640]  political dictators, continuing to go further and further status. And the Second Amendment
[1:49:44.640 --> 1:49:50.720]  folks is in danger. You cannot trust the Second Amendment to be respected or protected out
[1:49:50.720 --> 1:49:56.560]  of Washington. It's going to have to, we're going to have to focus on local grassroots
[1:49:56.560 --> 1:50:02.640]  from the ground up support of the Constitution to get it back. It's just that simple. Alright,
[1:50:02.640 --> 1:50:07.480]  as we look at what is happening to our liberties, I think this is expressed nowhere better than
[1:50:07.480 --> 1:50:14.560]  the pandemic. And the fact that as everything is winding down, and it really is in spite
[1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:20.320]  of the propaganda that is coming out of the press, it really is winding down. But they
[1:50:20.320 --> 1:50:24.000]  want you to believe it's ramping up a second wave. And now we've got to put in some new
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:29.640]  controls on you. And I'm going to tell you what this is really about. But as we look
[1:50:29.640 --> 1:50:33.800]  at the controls that are coming out, we've got California statewide, saying you got to
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:39.680]  wear a mask, Austin here telling all customers and workers that you got to wear masks inside
[1:50:39.680 --> 1:50:46.240]  of businesses in Florida, in the Florida Keys, they're now going to require face masks until
[1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:52.840]  June of 2021. So for another full year, they've extended it. They know that it's not going
[1:50:52.840 --> 1:50:59.040]  to go away for another year. How do they know that? Well, because they're the ones who are
[1:50:59.040 --> 1:51:04.000]  making it up. That's how they know. They can't possibly know. They don't have a computer
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:08.480]  model that's going to tell them this is going to last another year. They don't have a crystal
[1:51:08.480 --> 1:51:14.840]  ball that's going to tell them. But they're going to tell you when it ends. And I'm going
[1:51:14.840 --> 1:51:18.840]  to tell you when we come back how they're using it. As Reuters says, putting aside concerns
[1:51:18.840 --> 1:51:25.320]  about individual rights and its political unpopularity, we have to do this. We don't
[1:51:25.320 --> 1:51:28.440]  care about your individual rights. We don't care how much you dislike this. We're going
[1:51:28.440 --> 1:51:36.400]  to do this anyway. Many states and Austin, of course, we'll be right back. Stay with

[1:53:44.560 --> 1:53:57.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:57.680 --> 1:54:19.080]  Alright, as we see the ramping up, the second wave of lockdown. Reuters is very excited about
[1:54:19.080 --> 1:54:23.240]  the fact that Democrat states like California, North Carolina, Democrat controlled by Democrat
[1:54:23.240 --> 1:54:28.880]  governors and a string of U.S. cities like Democrat controlled Austin are mandating
[1:54:28.880 --> 1:54:35.600]  mandatory mass use. They say it's to get a grip on spiraling coronavirus cases and they
[1:54:35.600 --> 1:54:40.400]  don't want to worry about, we're going to put aside, as Reuters says, putting aside
[1:54:40.400 --> 1:54:45.000]  concerns about individual rights. That's right. Putting aside concerns about the Constitution
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:49.680]  because, you know, we just had the Supreme Court justices say, we don't really care.
[1:54:49.680 --> 1:54:53.440]  We have things that are more important than what the law says. We don't care what the
[1:54:53.440 --> 1:54:56.440]  Constitution says about any of this stuff. And it's also unpopular, but they don't care
[1:54:56.440 --> 1:55:03.480]  about that either. A growing number are adopting CDC guidance that masks are essential now.
[1:55:03.480 --> 1:55:06.680]  They're essential now. They were telling us at the beginning of this that, oh, you don't
[1:55:06.680 --> 1:55:10.840]  have to have a mask. As a matter of fact, it's going to make things worse, which a lot
[1:55:10.840 --> 1:55:16.160]  of doctors believe. You know, different doctors have different opinions about different treatments,
[1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:24.440]  about drugs, about masks and so forth. And you should be able to make up your own mind.
[1:55:24.440 --> 1:55:27.760]  You should be able to determine if we have a free country. Is it a free country? Yeah,
[1:55:27.760 --> 1:55:31.120]  it used to be something we said when I was growing up. Well, hey, man, you know, do you
[1:55:31.120 --> 1:55:35.240]  mind if I do? Well, it's a free country. When was the last time you heard anybody say that?
[1:55:35.240 --> 1:55:40.560]  Nobody says that anymore. Everybody knows America is not a free country. Or don't make
[1:55:40.560 --> 1:55:45.640]  a federal case out of it. Everything is a federal case now. It's not free because we
[1:55:45.640 --> 1:55:51.200]  made everything a federal case. But people are starting to catch on as to what's going
[1:55:51.200 --> 1:55:56.880]  on. For example, in Spain, one of the places where they have been locked down the hardest,
[1:55:56.880 --> 1:56:03.960]  there is now we got an article on info wars.com. Spain activists launch grassroots uprising
[1:56:03.960 --> 1:56:10.840]  against the false pandemic and the tyranny that is being ushered in based on that. Spanish
[1:56:10.840 --> 1:56:15.000]  authorities recently announced face masks and social distancing protocols remain mandatory
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:20.720]  until guess what? They've got an effective vaccine. What a surprise. Told you that was
[1:56:20.720 --> 1:56:24.640]  a process. You know why they're pushing the masks so hard now? And of course they said,
[1:56:24.640 --> 1:56:27.480]  well, until we have an effective therapy, but when you have an effective therapy, they
[1:56:27.480 --> 1:56:34.080]  will do everything they can with a propaganda press to cover it up or to push back against
[1:56:34.080 --> 1:56:40.480]  it. They don't want you to hear about intravenous vitamin C. They don't want you to know about
[1:56:40.480 --> 1:56:46.960]  zinc and hydroxychloroquine. They fudge research papers, even to the extent that the Lancet
[1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:55.040]  had to pull it back to attack hydroxychloroquine. They come after Trump for talking about it.
[1:56:55.040 --> 1:56:58.000]  Say these poisoning people, these killing people by talking about hydroxychlor... No,
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:03.120]  they're the ones who are killing people. When they come up with a steroid that could be used
[1:57:03.120 --> 1:57:06.720]  to help people who are already in advanced respiratory distress. No, no, no, we're not
[1:57:06.720 --> 1:57:08.760]  going to talk about that either. We're not going to talk about, certainly not going to
[1:57:08.760 --> 1:57:14.520]  talk about stem cells from umbilical cords because we've got to keep a lid on that. The
[1:57:14.520 --> 1:57:22.120]  FDA has pushed really hard against using your own stem cells. The FDA has never regulated
[1:57:22.120 --> 1:57:27.040]  you using biologics, your own biologics, not even biologics from somebody else, but your
[1:57:27.040 --> 1:57:32.520]  own biologic. You can take stem cells out of a fat. They withdraw some fat from your
[1:57:32.520 --> 1:57:38.480]  body, put it in a centrifuge to get the stem cells and then inject it back into your own
[1:57:38.480 --> 1:57:45.800]  body. And the FDA says you can't do that. Do you smell something fishy here? It's because
[1:57:45.800 --> 1:57:50.280]  they want to be able to patent stem cells from aborted fetuses, but you can get stem
[1:57:50.280 --> 1:57:53.680]  cells from a lot of different things. The FDA will say, well, you can get stem cells
[1:57:53.680 --> 1:58:00.400]  from your own bone marrow. That's a very expensive, very painful process. So they're waiting
[1:58:00.400 --> 1:58:05.280]  until they've got something else that they can push against you. But the FDA has never
[1:58:05.280 --> 1:58:09.360]  claimed that it had that kind of authority in the past. And now they have just moved
[1:58:09.360 --> 1:58:13.840]  into that area. As just as they're saying, well, you know, because of COVID-19, we got
[1:58:13.840 --> 1:58:22.600]  to stop all buffets and salad bars too. And they want to make sure, again, the face masks
[1:58:22.600 --> 1:58:26.160]  are core because this is ultimately about the fact that they're going to push back against
[1:58:26.160 --> 1:58:32.360]  any effective treatment. This is about making sure that you believe that you're not protected
[1:58:32.360 --> 1:58:35.240]  unless other people are wearing face masks, just like you're not going to be protected
[1:58:35.240 --> 1:58:42.240]  unless other people are vaccinated. We'll be right back.
[1:58:42.240 --> 1:58:55.440]  David Rockefeller and other satanic pieces of garbage who thought they've set up their
[1:58:55.440 --> 1:59:03.920]  world government believe they pulled the drain on America a long time ago. But if we understand
[1:59:03.920 --> 1:59:12.000]  that they've orchestrated this by design, that there's a mass awakening, it can be
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:17.920]  their unraveling, their destruction, and then going down the drain. The Bible tells us that
[1:59:17.920 --> 1:59:23.240]  many times when the enemy digs a pit for us, they themselves fall into it. But God is the
[1:59:23.240 --> 1:59:27.720]  master of the universe, but gives us free will in this plan and his test. It is up to
[1:59:27.720 --> 1:59:32.640]  us to decide whether we're going down the drain or whether the globalists are going
[1:59:32.640 --> 1:59:36.880]  down the drain. I cannot express to listeners and viewers of this broadcast how important
[1:59:36.880 --> 1:59:43.760]  you are. Everything hinges on you. Everything peacefully become the Paul Revere you know
[1:59:43.760 --> 1:59:52.760]  you've always been. God bless and good luck.
[1:59:52.760 --> 2:00:00.480]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now
[2:00:00.480 --> 2:00:07.480]  your host, David Knight.
[2:00:07.480 --> 2:00:17.160]  Here's the example of how this is a political virus. We have the Wall Street Journal saying
[2:00:17.160 --> 2:00:23.280]  early data shows no uptick in COVID-19 transmission from protests. That's the one place you can't
[2:00:23.280 --> 2:00:29.080]  get it. I reported a couple of weeks ago in the morning show. My show precedes this one
[2:00:29.080 --> 2:00:37.000]  Monday through Friday. I talked about NPR and they ranked 12 or 15 different activities
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:44.160]  that you could do. And you know the one, there were two of them that were high risk and one
[2:00:44.160 --> 2:00:55.320]  of them was going to church. It was higher risk than going to a nightclub. And so make
[2:00:55.320 --> 2:00:58.960]  sure you don't go to church. Because you're going to get sick if you go to church. You're
[2:00:58.960 --> 2:01:02.560]  going to get sick if you go to a Trump rally. But if you go to a protest, you're okay. And
[2:01:02.560 --> 2:01:09.320]  I guess maybe it's because the arson kills the virus, burns it up. As you're burning
[2:01:09.320 --> 2:01:15.000]  down the buildings, you're going to be fine. Early coronavirus testing data from a handful
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:19.600]  of U.S. cities and states suggests recent protests against racial injustice haven't
[2:01:19.600 --> 2:01:26.760]  led to a marked uptick in new cases. And again, it's not, you're not getting an uptick
[2:01:26.760 --> 2:01:33.040]  anywhere with this. What they do to keep this going is they're showing you now the total
[2:01:33.040 --> 2:01:39.000]  number of people who died according to the CDC. And these, as we've talked about many
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:43.720]  times in the past, did you die from coronavirus? Did you die with coronavirus? Did you even
[2:01:43.720 --> 2:01:48.520]  test to see if they had coronavirus? No, no, no, we will just go by the CDC statistics
[2:01:48.520 --> 2:01:54.240]  and we'll keep bumping that number up forever. Cuomo, meanwhile, says, I wouldn't even allow
[2:01:54.240 --> 2:01:59.880]  a large political rally in New York. Oh, yeah, Trump's got this rally coming up in Tulsa
[2:01:59.880 --> 2:02:05.720]  tomorrow. So, you know, he's upset about that. Because, you know, the protests are not political
[2:02:05.720 --> 2:02:10.840]  rallies at all, right? You understand that they're not political rallies at all. And
[2:02:10.840 --> 2:02:17.800]  the Tulsa people are not happy about this either. They say we haven't gotten a plan about how
[2:02:17.800 --> 2:02:23.000]  the Trump people are going to keep people safe at this rally. Let me tell you how you
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:28.080]  keep people safe. You respect their individual liberty, you respect the Constitution, and
[2:02:28.080 --> 2:02:31.920]  you tell them what you think and then leave it up to them to make those choices. If you
[2:02:31.920 --> 2:02:37.480]  take away people's informed choices, if you interject yourself into the doctor-patient
[2:02:37.480 --> 2:02:42.000]  relationship, into the parent-child relationship in order to force certain medical treatments
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:47.880]  or to prohibit people from having medical treatments that they want, like their own stem cells,
[2:02:47.880 --> 2:02:53.440]  this is nothing but medical tyranny, folks. So, when you look at the way the propaganda
[2:02:53.440 --> 2:02:58.000]  press is spinning this, AP says, poll shows, Gallup poll shows, Americans are not buying
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:06.320]  White House spin on the coronavirus by President Pence. So, the U.S. response to the coronavirus
[2:03:06.320 --> 2:03:11.400]  pandemic is a cause for celebration. But a new poll finds more than half Americans calling
[2:03:11.400 --> 2:03:18.960]  it fair or poor. So, now the question is, did they ask people, did you want the government
[2:03:18.960 --> 2:03:25.760]  to do more or less? Because, quite frankly, I would rank what the White House and what
[2:03:25.760 --> 2:03:32.040]  governors have done, Democrat and Republican, because if you lock down half of our freedoms
[2:03:32.040 --> 2:03:42.440]  here, we're still not free. But I would rank all of our government officials as poor.
[2:03:42.440 --> 2:03:45.800]  As poor. Because I think they did too much, but that's not the way they're reading this.
[2:03:45.800 --> 2:03:50.040]  They're saying, well, he didn't do enough. We're not happy with this. So, it doesn't
[2:03:50.040 --> 2:03:54.600]  matter whether you think that they went too far or not far enough. Oh, well, the Gallup
[2:03:54.600 --> 2:03:58.320]  poll is going to say everybody disagrees with the White House, because it is about nothing
[2:03:58.320 --> 2:04:06.960]  but politics. Coronavirus cases are spiking, says CVS, and experts in Florida say it's
[2:04:06.960 --> 2:04:12.040]  got all the markings of the next epicenter. And again, this is why they want to do this,
[2:04:12.040 --> 2:04:18.080]  and this is why the officials in Key West have said, well, we're going to extend this
[2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:25.080]  until June of 2021. They have no idea why they have to do it for another year, but hey,
[2:04:25.080 --> 2:04:29.360]  just another year. And remember, from the very beginning, we were talking about how
[2:04:29.360 --> 2:04:36.120]  this was their goal, how they had to be opposed, not just fired, but they had to be opposed.
[2:04:36.120 --> 2:04:41.400]  Their lives had to be deconstructed with people who have told us the truth from the very beginning.
[2:04:41.400 --> 2:04:47.040]  From before it began, because their agenda is to lock us down and to keep us locked down,
[2:04:47.040 --> 2:04:53.720]  because it is to tear this country apart. You know, when I look at what people have
[2:04:53.720 --> 2:05:02.280]  been saying, even before this began, even before this began, months before this began,
[2:05:02.280 --> 2:05:06.600]  you had people talking about the fourth turning like I've been saying, we are accelerating
[2:05:06.600 --> 2:05:13.720]  towards the climax. The anti-lockdown protesters could become violent if the U.S. revives quarantine
[2:05:13.720 --> 2:05:22.640]  measures. This was two days before they took the George Floyd death and used that to do
[2:05:22.640 --> 2:05:27.720]  that very thing. They already knew that the conditions were right. They knew that we were
[2:05:27.720 --> 2:05:32.960]  at a point in generational history where there was going to be some kind of a change. We
[2:05:32.960 --> 2:05:39.280]  can either have a freer society or we can have a society that is far more authoritarian
[2:05:39.280 --> 2:05:48.360]  and locked down. And so they put their own pandemic in place. And as they locked us down,
[2:05:48.360 --> 2:05:50.640]  this is why I'm talking about this, because you know, when you go back, you won't talk
[2:05:50.640 --> 2:05:58.720]  about Chazistan, East and West Chazistan, Seattle and Minneapolis. You can talk about
[2:05:58.720 --> 2:06:05.320]  that, but understand the root of that is this lockdown that was put in place based on Fauci
[2:06:05.320 --> 2:06:11.280]  and the CDC. And the DHS and DHS Department of Homeland Security was warning. They said,
[2:06:11.280 --> 2:06:16.840]  hey, protesters could get violent if the U.S. revives quarantine measures because they've
[2:06:16.840 --> 2:06:23.480]  had it at this point. So what did they do? Well, they engineered a, they cherry-picked
[2:06:23.480 --> 2:06:32.880]  an incident and made it all about race. And people are ready to fight at that point in
[2:06:32.880 --> 2:06:39.960]  time. Now you've got, in Washington Examiner, they're saying people would be crushed by
[2:06:39.960 --> 2:06:45.040]  a second coronavirus wave, say psychologists. I think a second wave would be devastating
[2:06:45.040 --> 2:06:50.680]  for a lot of people. So the professor of psychology at the University of Connecticut, Dr. Crystal
[2:06:50.680 --> 2:06:54.800]  Park, there is a sense that we've been through a really terrible, traumatic time, and we're
[2:06:54.800 --> 2:06:59.640]  now in a phase of reopening and recovery. So that's why they have to push it right now.
[2:06:59.640 --> 2:07:05.120]  That's why they had to push the George Floyd thing. They get everybody, they wait until
[2:07:05.120 --> 2:07:11.080]  the moment is right in history, and then they push the pandemic. Then after they've got
[2:07:11.080 --> 2:07:17.600]  everybody locked down for three months, they create a race war scenario. And then they
[2:07:17.600 --> 2:07:23.040]  add to it, they bring back the pandemic. They push the pause button, and now they're going
[2:07:23.040 --> 2:07:28.400]  to reaccelerate it. An article on zero hedge from the American Institute for Economic Research
[2:07:28.400 --> 2:07:34.480]  says, spike? What spike? Hospitalization data shows no indication of a second wave, but
[2:07:34.480 --> 2:07:39.040]  you wouldn't know that if you look at the mainstream press. Everywhere they're telling
[2:07:39.040 --> 2:07:43.600]  everybody, we've got to take more drastic measures now. We're going to have mandatory
[2:07:43.600 --> 2:07:51.680]  masks now. We're not going to allow you to get out from under our thumb. And as you look
[2:07:51.680 --> 2:08:00.760]  at Fox News, alarm as vaccine foes and anti-mast activists target public health officials.
[2:08:00.760 --> 2:08:12.720]  Oh, yeah. We're the bad guys. They usurp their authority. An alliance of anti-vaccine activists
[2:08:12.720 --> 2:08:19.840]  and those protesting California's coronavirus-related restrictions are alarming public health officials.
[2:08:19.840 --> 2:08:25.680]  Our dictators, our new dictators, the people who will shut us down at will and keep us
[2:08:25.680 --> 2:08:30.480]  locked down for another year if they feel like it. They just did that in Key West. Everywhere
[2:08:30.480 --> 2:08:34.800]  in California, mass protesters have called for similar rallies outside the homes of
[2:08:34.800 --> 2:08:40.600]  public health officers. See, we shouldn't be allowed to protest these. It's wonderful
[2:08:40.600 --> 2:08:47.200]  if we protest the police. It's wonderful if we protest and burn in the name of racism.
[2:08:47.200 --> 2:08:52.080]  But hey, if they're going to lock you down and enslave you arbitrarily, these unelected
[2:08:52.080 --> 2:08:58.960]  officials don't you dare show up and protest them. And we saw this in Michigan with Whitmer.
[2:08:58.960 --> 2:09:05.600]  I'm furious that people would show up in their cars with their windows rolled up and
[2:09:05.600 --> 2:09:10.800]  honk their horns and protest. Oh, that's horrible. And yet they could come out and protest cheek
[2:09:10.800 --> 2:09:17.240]  to cheek. You'd have the police officers take off their masks and do selfies with people.
[2:09:17.240 --> 2:09:24.120]  And that's wonderful. Customers are reportedly having tantrums over wearing masks, writes
[2:09:24.120 --> 2:09:32.360]  the Detroit News. Yeah, I think the best headline I've seen is tear down this plexiglass paraphrasing
[2:09:32.360 --> 2:09:39.800]  Ronald Reagan. I just say that Mr. President, tear down this plexiglass. You're allowing
[2:09:39.800 --> 2:09:43.760]  these people to destroy this country and they're going to destroy your chances of reelection
[2:09:43.760 --> 2:09:55.080]  as well. We'll be right back. Stay with us. Globalists have gotten away with their Russia
[2:09:55.080 --> 2:10:04.200]  Gate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax. And now it's the race riot hoax of
[2:10:04.200 --> 2:10:09.360]  2020. We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next. I can tell you it's going to be a bunch
[2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:15.160]  of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war. It's going to be economic
[2:10:15.160 --> 2:10:21.360]  collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it. The globalists are attacking
[2:10:21.360 --> 2:10:26.000]  on every front. That's why now, more than ever, we have to realize they tried to censor
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:30.920]  them floors off here because they knew when they watched this whole situation that they
[2:10:30.920 --> 2:10:35.920]  didn't want the people's voice to still be on air. But thanks to you and our crew, we
[2:10:35.920 --> 2:10:42.920]  are still on air. So let's boost that transmission like the Batman's signal now more than ever.
[2:10:42.920 --> 2:10:46.400]  In 4Wars.com lives.
[2:10:46.400 --> 2:10:50.520]  Just during the break, I went and got a delicious cup, a second cup of the day. It's really
[2:10:50.520 --> 2:10:54.600]  strong. I shouldn't do this because all work and no playmates jack a really aggressive
[2:10:54.600 --> 2:10:58.920]  boy and the coffee has to wake up America coffee there by loves highest rated in the
[2:10:58.920 --> 2:11:02.720]  choppers mountains. It's beyond Mexican coffee, beyond Guatemalan coffee. It's the best coffee
[2:11:02.720 --> 2:11:06.160]  in the world. It's right on the border between the two countries in those rainforests hand
[2:11:06.160 --> 2:11:10.480]  selected. It's beyond organic. Wildcrafted. Wake up America coffee. People are blown away
[2:11:10.480 --> 2:11:14.800]  by how good it is. Same stuff sold in Whole Foods on another name for $30 for the same
[2:11:14.800 --> 2:11:19.400]  size container. Yes, folks, we've been selling at 10 years, never raised the price. 1995

[2:11:41.360 --> 2:12:09.680]  It's not as popular. Anyways, it's all at infowarstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:12:09.680 --> 2:12:19.360]  You can run on for a long time. Run on for a long time. Run on for a long time. Sooner
[2:12:19.360 --> 2:12:26.360]  or later, gotta cut you down. Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[2:12:26.360 --> 2:12:31.640]  Mr. President, tear down this plexiglass. There's a great article from American Institute
[2:12:31.640 --> 2:12:37.840]  for Economic Research. Guy talking about his experiences at the gym that he used to attend
[2:12:37.840 --> 2:12:42.880]  before the lockdown three months ago. He said, on Monday, June 16th, I was finally given
[2:12:42.880 --> 2:12:48.280]  government permission to return to the gymnasium I'd been affiliated with for over two decades
[2:12:48.280 --> 2:12:53.440]  because I like it. He goes, I go for the people. The desk staff knows me pretty well. They
[2:12:53.440 --> 2:12:56.760]  like that I usually come in with some kind of a quirkery mark that generates a chuckle
[2:12:56.760 --> 2:13:00.960]  or two. Every time I enter, my goal is to get them to laugh. And there's always some
[2:13:00.960 --> 2:13:05.520]  chit chat every each day. I find out a little bit more about them. And they discover a little
[2:13:05.520 --> 2:13:10.760]  bit more about me, where they went the night before and what muscles are aching on me today.
[2:13:10.760 --> 2:13:17.280]  But he said, now, however, there is plexiglass. When I arrived on Monday, the first time back
[2:13:17.280 --> 2:13:23.120]  in at least 14 weeks, I had to go first to a check, to a check intent just outside the
[2:13:23.120 --> 2:13:28.800]  doors. There I had to sign a waiver about the coronavirus. I had to answer a set of
[2:13:28.800 --> 2:13:33.520]  questions about any symptoms that I might have, then get my temperature taken remotely
[2:13:33.520 --> 2:13:38.720]  by a gentleman with a mask and one of those thermal scanners. Once I passed that gauntlet,
[2:13:38.720 --> 2:13:43.560]  I could walk through the doors that were propped open, so I didn't have to touch the handle.
[2:13:43.560 --> 2:13:49.360]  In the lobby, I was shocked to see that the main desk now had giant sheets of plexiglass
[2:13:49.360 --> 2:13:54.160]  in front of the two stations, where the staff usually stands and hands out towels. It looked
[2:13:54.160 --> 2:14:01.040]  odd. We were not allowed to get towels, let alone shower there. I have to bring my own
[2:14:01.040 --> 2:14:10.320]  small sweat rags. And then there's that plexiglass. Everything felt different because of the plexiglass.
[2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:14.360]  Back in the old days of the West, banks would have steel bars and separate them from the
[2:14:14.360 --> 2:14:19.780]  customers. This was done to make it more difficult to jump over the counter and rob the bank.
[2:14:19.780 --> 2:14:22.900]  Because in a world of transient individuals and many strangers passing through, you never
[2:14:22.900 --> 2:14:29.800]  knew who to trust. In crime-ridden areas today, metal bars and thick plexiglass separate customers
[2:14:29.800 --> 2:14:35.040]  from staff in pawn shops and check-cashing facilities and liquor stores and places that
[2:14:35.040 --> 2:14:43.480]  are targets for robbery. Places where trust between individuals is unfortunately low.
[2:14:43.480 --> 2:14:51.400]  Such a lack of trust is not good for the economy. And he says metal bars and plexiglass cases
[2:14:51.400 --> 2:14:56.480]  also breed distrust and damage, our willingness to exchange and to interact with each other.
[2:14:56.480 --> 2:15:02.720]  And of course, there's also the mask. You can't see people's expressions. One psychologist
[2:15:02.720 --> 2:15:07.280]  said it's not just the frustration of being locked down and then told suddenly, well,
[2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:14.120]  you can go out if you'll protest or riot or attack white people. He said it's also the
[2:15:14.120 --> 2:15:19.320]  fact that it's accelerated the misunderstanding between people. How do you read somebody else?
[2:15:19.320 --> 2:15:23.480]  How do you read their intentions when you get out on the street in a protest when you
[2:15:23.480 --> 2:15:31.600]  can't see people's most of their faces covered up? It accelerates that. He said now plexiglass
[2:15:31.600 --> 2:15:38.120]  is everywhere. Suburban grocery stores, small town restaurants, gymnasiums. It's good for
[2:15:38.120 --> 2:15:41.520]  the plexiglass manufacturers, but it's bad for us. And let me tell you what it's really
[2:15:41.520 --> 2:15:46.280]  bad for. It's bad for small businesses. You think that business is going to stay in business?
[2:15:46.280 --> 2:15:51.600]  What they're doing is they're turning America into East Germany. That's why I said it's
[2:15:51.600 --> 2:15:58.040]  a perfect title. He didn't make that comparison, but yeah, President Trump, tear down this plexiglass
[2:15:58.040 --> 2:16:05.160]  wall. You didn't build the wall at the border, but boy, we've got walls everywhere between
[2:16:05.160 --> 2:16:15.280]  each other now within this country. They have locked us down. In East Germany, it wasn't
[2:16:15.280 --> 2:16:22.680]  just the Stasi snitch society where everybody was keeping notes on everybody else. And I've
[2:16:22.680 --> 2:16:30.280]  talked about this, the diary as they started looking at what the people in East Germany
[2:16:30.280 --> 2:16:36.280]  were doing to each other. One American who went to East Germany because she liked these
[2:16:36.280 --> 2:16:40.680]  Antifa Marxists. She loved communism and she wanted to get as much of it as she could.
[2:16:40.680 --> 2:16:48.680]  So she went to the heart of it in East Germany. She went there to go to school and she met
[2:16:48.680 --> 2:16:55.880]  an East German and married him. Now that made him suspicious to them. And so to her surprise,
[2:16:55.880 --> 2:16:58.920]  she found out decades later, as people were going through the records of Stasi, she found
[2:16:58.920 --> 2:17:07.520]  out that she and her husband were the focus of suspicion by the East Germans. And to her
[2:17:07.520 --> 2:17:12.240]  consternation, she found out that many of the closest friends had been informants for
[2:17:12.240 --> 2:17:18.760]  the Stasi as well. It didn't put her off of her love of communism, however, because it
[2:17:18.760 --> 2:17:25.120]  just hasn't been tried the right way. We always hear that, right? But one of the things that
[2:17:25.120 --> 2:17:31.200]  she said that really stuck with me was she said, you would talk to people in East Germany
[2:17:31.200 --> 2:17:37.760]  in a private capacity, you know, you're just in an informal setting where they're not working
[2:17:37.760 --> 2:17:43.480]  on their job. And she said that just be the nicest people. But then you might go into
[2:17:43.480 --> 2:17:54.160]  where this person works and let's say a butcher shop. And they're so officious. They have power.
[2:17:54.160 --> 2:17:59.640]  It's not just the informants that are everywhere. But it's the fact that when everybody is being
[2:17:59.640 --> 2:18:06.240]  bossed around for every little arbitrary reason, then once they get into a position where they
[2:18:06.240 --> 2:18:15.520]  are in a shop and you have to go there to use your ration checks or your cash to buy
[2:18:15.520 --> 2:18:20.720]  something from that shop, now they've got power over you. It's what we see happening
[2:18:20.720 --> 2:18:25.360]  throughout the airline industry and has been happening for a while. Once they put in all
[2:18:25.360 --> 2:18:32.360]  kinds of regulations at the airline industry in the wake of 9-11, you saw the airline stewardesses
[2:18:32.360 --> 2:18:38.760]  and attendants, the people at the gate, everywhere in the airport, people get officious, don't
[2:18:38.760 --> 2:18:42.200]  they? They've got rules and regulations and you better follow these rules and regulations.
[2:18:42.200 --> 2:18:47.440]  I'm telling you what you've got to do. And now with this lockdown, we've seen this being
[2:18:47.440 --> 2:18:55.600]  put out everywhere in our society. My wife, who goes to Costco, has noticed as you tell
[2:18:55.600 --> 2:19:01.720]  me weeks that she doesn't go anymore. The first three weeks, they began to get worse
[2:19:01.720 --> 2:19:09.600]  and worse as they started to put in their policies about what people had to do. And
[2:19:09.600 --> 2:19:14.400]  they would first just kind of suggest that you should wear a mask and then they started
[2:19:14.400 --> 2:19:20.640]  getting more and more in your face about it, gave her kind of, you know, she wasn't wearing
[2:19:20.640 --> 2:19:25.280]  a mask, she was in line outside the store. The lady stopped right next to her and then
[2:19:25.280 --> 2:19:29.840]  does, doesn't address her directly, but addresses the crowd standing right next to her and she
[2:19:29.840 --> 2:19:35.680]  was the only person in line who was not wearing a mask. For your safety, we would suggest that
[2:19:35.680 --> 2:19:40.120]  you wear a mask and then the next week when she went, so that's kind of a bleep, the next
[2:19:40.120 --> 2:19:44.920]  week she directly engaged her, told her, you must wear a mask. It's the law. See, this
[2:19:44.920 --> 2:19:52.840]  is how America is being turned into East Germany. That aspect, plus the fear aspect
[2:19:52.840 --> 2:20:00.880]  that people are afraid to go anywhere. As a matter of fact, it's not just the restaurant
[2:20:00.880 --> 2:20:04.160]  industry, you know, with it, they're saying, well, you know, we're going to be allowed
[2:20:04.160 --> 2:20:11.680]  to reopen 50 50. And so it basically is a suicide pack. As reason magazine points out.
[2:20:11.680 --> 2:20:15.480]  These phase reopenings are going to be too little too late. If you're going to open up
[2:20:15.480 --> 2:20:20.240]  a restaurant, even here in Texas, our Republican governor Abbott has graciously allowed us
[2:20:20.240 --> 2:20:25.840]  to be half free. Even Austin, you know, the little Marxist here who put on the mandatory
[2:20:25.840 --> 2:20:29.080]  stuff, well, they're, well, you don't have to wear a mask. If you're eating or drinking,
[2:20:29.080 --> 2:20:34.720]  oh, really? I don't. Matter of fact, you don't have to wear that even on airlines. If you're
[2:20:34.720 --> 2:20:38.640]  eating a pretzel, but they have instructions on how you got to, how you can put that emergency
[2:20:38.640 --> 2:20:43.120]  mask that drops down at the top thing there, how you can put that over your temporary mask.
[2:20:43.120 --> 2:20:47.880]  That's the insanity we're seeing. Let's go to one in Connecticut. You're on the air.
[2:20:47.880 --> 2:20:53.480]  Thanks for holding. I sure can sir. Thank you. Before I start, man, I just wanted to
[2:20:53.480 --> 2:20:58.440]  talk to you. Go and it's a pleasure to be talking right now. It's an honor to talk to
[2:20:58.440 --> 2:21:03.760]  you, brother from New Brink, Connecticut. And I just want to plug in. I'm a truck driver
[2:21:03.760 --> 2:21:09.840]  and two before that have changed the way I drive. Me and my brothers that drive a couple
[2:21:09.840 --> 2:21:17.640]  of us. We are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans. We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and
[2:21:17.640 --> 2:21:21.880]  Rolla and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar. And I just want to
[2:21:21.880 --> 2:21:26.080]  thank you for that, man. Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long term
[2:21:26.080 --> 2:21:30.360]  high quality energy powder there is. So this, this was designed on one of the top guys in
[2:21:30.360 --> 2:21:33.400]  the country. He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues, but
[2:21:33.400 --> 2:21:36.680]  we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it. And we believe
[2:21:36.680 --> 2:21:40.880]  it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there. And you're saying that it's
[2:21:40.880 --> 2:21:43.840]  made your life better. So that means a lot to me. Thank you to all your truck drivers.
[2:21:43.840 --> 2:21:48.880]  We love you. I was talking to my Patriot supplier, great suppliers. You can now say four weeks
[2:21:48.880 --> 2:21:54.160]  on average for storeable food. It's the highest quality. They've got it. Use this little rest
[2:21:54.160 --> 2:21:58.160]  we have caught in the current to come up to the surface, get some air before you get
[2:21:58.160 --> 2:22:02.840]  sucked back down. I personally am ordering more storeable food. I have to now start going
[2:22:02.840 --> 2:22:09.000]  into defense posture, 80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense, trying to fully,
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:12.440]  you know, stop the globalists and we've given them a good run. And I think down the road,
[2:22:12.440 --> 2:22:17.720]  they'll be defeated, but we're going to still go down the hard road now. There were a lot
[2:22:17.720 --> 2:22:22.120]  worse roads. We'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still going
[2:22:22.120 --> 2:22:25.960]  to be bad. My view, you need to get high quality storeable food. It's something you need. We
[2:22:25.960 --> 2:22:29.920]  have high quality ready to get out to you and it supports the broadcast and 360 wins.
[2:22:29.920 --> 2:22:34.680]  So please take care of your storeable foods needs at info or store.com and get your orders
[2:22:34.680 --> 2:22:39.840]  in now. So you get it. So you have it in great containers, high quality, last 25 years, get
[2:22:39.840 --> 2:22:43.520]  it while you can. Because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen nothing
[2:22:43.520 --> 2:22:47.920]  yet. I'm always excited about info or life products. They're amazing. They're cutting
[2:22:47.920 --> 2:22:51.480]  edge. You love them. I love them. And they find the info or in the face of the globalist
[2:22:51.480 --> 2:22:59.640]  onslaught, but we have come up with a new product over a year in development. That is amazing.
[2:22:59.640 --> 2:23:07.400]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[2:23:07.400 --> 2:23:14.160]  And there's another innovation. It's the spray cap. It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick,
[2:23:14.160 --> 2:23:19.640]  gross, goo, but it's high quality. It aerosolizes it in a really great way. I like to put it
[2:23:19.640 --> 2:23:24.400]  on my hands, rub a little bit on my face. It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it
[2:23:24.400 --> 2:23:29.720]  right in your eyes. But I just love it personally as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[2:23:29.720 --> 2:23:33.240]  So this is a real innovation. I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with
[2:23:33.240 --> 2:23:38.320]  a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out. It smells
[2:23:38.320 --> 2:23:47.800]  great. It's so refreshing. This is a big winner.
[2:23:47.800 --> 2:23:54.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:23:54.800 --> 2:24:24.600]  I'm playing the AOC theme song here. Don't know much about history. Don't know anything
[2:24:24.600 --> 2:24:30.800]  about science and climate change, but oh, we know we love AOC, right? Yeah, Twitter kept
[2:24:30.800 --> 2:24:36.560]  badgering my wife to follow AOC and to turn off notifications from me. And then finally,
[2:24:36.560 --> 2:24:41.320]  they just unfollowed her from me. If you want to follow me, you can follow me at Liberty
[2:24:41.320 --> 2:24:45.920]  Terrain, but they may not send you any notifications. You'll have to go there directly. As we're
[2:24:45.920 --> 2:24:54.240]  talking about the psychological and political lockdown that's going on now, the pandemic,
[2:24:54.240 --> 2:24:59.840]  it enraged a lot of people that movie theater chains are going to be opening in mid-July.
[2:24:59.840 --> 2:25:07.280]  AMC theaters, Regal Cinema, Cinemark. No, no, you can't do this. One of them, the AMC announced
[2:25:07.280 --> 2:25:14.720]  that they will sell masks if you want them for a dollar. But they said employees will
[2:25:14.720 --> 2:25:19.480]  be required to wear protective equipment, but you won't. You can wear protective equipment
[2:25:19.480 --> 2:25:25.680]  if you wish. But again, this goes back to the psychology of the mask. And as I pointed
[2:25:25.680 --> 2:25:31.520]  out the other day, why did they call it N95? Because it gets 95% of the particles that
[2:25:31.520 --> 2:25:42.960]  are 0.3 microns are bigger. The COVID virus is 0.125 microns. Well, they say it's going
[2:25:42.960 --> 2:25:48.600]  to catch the spit and keep that from happening. Well, doesn't that work then? If you've got
[2:25:48.600 --> 2:25:55.040]  it in front of your face or what? No, no, no, we got to have, you're not safe unless
[2:25:55.040 --> 2:26:05.320]  I wear a mask. I'm not safe unless you wear a mask. That's Barney science. I love you.
[2:26:05.320 --> 2:26:10.320]  You love me. But this is the whole idea behind the vaccine. The vaccines don't work unless
[2:26:10.320 --> 2:26:16.200]  everybody gets them. They say it's not going to protect you unless I get a vaccine. And
[2:26:16.200 --> 2:26:21.440]  that's why they're pushing this because the end game on this is the vaccine. And that's
[2:26:21.440 --> 2:26:26.740]  what concerns me so much. And President Trump is pouring billions of dollars into vaccine
[2:26:26.740 --> 2:26:31.880]  development and vaccine manufacturing and telling them we're not going to worry about
[2:26:31.880 --> 2:26:34.600]  testing. We're going to have this out by the end of the year. Why? Because he wants it
[2:26:34.600 --> 2:26:39.680]  for the economy. He doesn't care about the safety or the efficacy or the Constitution
[2:26:39.680 --> 2:26:44.760]  or your individual liberty or your informed consent or free choice. None of that is important
[2:26:44.760 --> 2:26:52.840]  to these people. Republican or Democrat is absolutely reprehensible. And so these people
[2:26:52.840 --> 2:26:59.360]  are now calling the CEO of AMC an idiot. He says, I just don't want to get drawn into
[2:26:59.360 --> 2:27:02.200]  a political controversy. I'm going to wear it. I think it's a good thing. I think you
[2:27:02.200 --> 2:27:05.960]  ought to wear it, but I'm not going to force you to wear it. Oh, but see, we have to, if
[2:27:05.960 --> 2:27:11.480]  I think a certain way, you must think that certain way as well, or you're going to be
[2:27:11.480 --> 2:27:15.000]  kicked off of social media. If you say something different, if you say something that I don't
[2:27:15.000 --> 2:27:19.480]  agree with or I don't like, I'm going to kick you off. This whole mask thing is part of
[2:27:19.480 --> 2:27:29.200]  the canceled culture. It's about all of this is about a mandate that is being forced upon
[2:27:29.200 --> 2:27:34.680]  us as a federalist. So here's the reason why they want to kick them off because they say
[2:27:34.680 --> 2:27:41.440]  the same sorts of things we say Americans should never again comply with pandemic lockdown
[2:27:41.440 --> 2:27:46.800]  orders. Never comply with orders. I've tweeted this out over and over again. I say, wait,
[2:27:46.800 --> 2:27:52.040]  I'm all for medical advice. I'm all ears when it comes to medical advice. I have an open
[2:27:52.040 --> 2:27:56.520]  mind when it comes to medical advice, but I don't take orders from any doctor or any
[2:27:56.520 --> 2:28:04.880]  politician. I'm sorry, you make this an order. Well, now it's up. It's my delight to disobey
[2:28:04.880 --> 2:28:09.080]  that order because you don't have the authority to do this. And there are more important things
[2:28:09.080 --> 2:28:17.320]  in getting sick. Live free or die. Jobless claims have now totaled one and a half million.
[2:28:17.320 --> 2:28:22.000]  But we were told by the Department of Labor that things improved. And then I said, oh,
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:25.880]  wait, you know, it would be at least another three or four points higher if we'd defined
[2:28:25.880 --> 2:28:30.080]  it differently. And I said before that came out, I said, look, when the government gives
[2:28:30.080 --> 2:28:34.560]  you statistics are always lying, whether it's the CDC, they're going to inflate the COVID
[2:28:34.560 --> 2:28:39.400]  deaths. If it's the unemployment, if the Bureau of Labor Statistics are going to lie to make
[2:28:39.400 --> 2:28:46.400]  it look better. And every quarter, they will revise the figures. And this is not something
[2:28:46.400 --> 2:28:50.120]  that just a Trump administration is always done by them to make every administration
[2:28:50.120 --> 2:28:58.280]  look better. They will always revise up the unemployment figures as they release the new
[2:28:58.280 --> 2:29:02.480]  ones. They'll revise up the previous one. So the trend always looks good. They always
[2:29:02.480 --> 2:29:07.840]  do that. And so we got another one and a half million people. Take a look at this video
[2:29:07.840 --> 2:29:14.760]  that was posted up. We have a problem. This isn't a protest video clip number two. Roll
[2:29:14.760 --> 2:29:20.840]  that as B roll here, I'll tell you. This isn't a protest. It's not a rally. It's a time lapse.
[2:29:20.840 --> 2:29:25.120]  Look at the length of this line here. This is not a protest or rally. This is an eight
[2:29:25.120 --> 2:29:32.200]  hour wait from the back of the line to speak to a state employee about unemployment benefits.
[2:29:32.200 --> 2:29:39.200]  And you're seeing this everywhere. You're going to take your job. You're going to shut
[2:29:39.200 --> 2:29:42.360]  down your business, but don't worry. We got a government check coming for you, except
[2:29:42.360 --> 2:29:46.400]  it doesn't show up. It doesn't show up for the businesses. It doesn't show up for the
[2:29:46.400 --> 2:29:56.200]  individuals. We have Gretchen Whitmer, the queen of Michigan. And she's confronted by
[2:29:56.200 --> 2:30:02.720]  a laid off healthcare worker. How do you have all these hospitals going bankrupt during
[2:30:02.720 --> 2:30:07.600]  a pandemic? Well, government management, right? That's how you do it. Or maybe it's not a
[2:30:07.600 --> 2:30:12.800]  pandemic, but certainly even in a pandemic, if the government is controlling our healthcare,
[2:30:12.800 --> 2:30:22.520]  it can destroy the jobs of healthcare workers. So this black man, it looks like he's elderly,
[2:30:22.520 --> 2:30:28.880]  at least middle age, maybe a little bit older, confronts Governor Whitmer and says, I haven't
[2:30:28.880 --> 2:30:33.480]  received any of my benefits yet. He says, is there any possible way that you could put
[2:30:33.480 --> 2:30:37.360]  my name in? Because people are just kind of getting a busy signal. Essentially, if they
[2:30:37.360 --> 2:30:42.640]  try to get online or they try to call in, they can't get in because the things are crashing.
[2:30:42.640 --> 2:30:47.400]  The sites are crashing. The phones are busy because so many people are trying to get unemployment
[2:30:47.400 --> 2:30:52.240]  benefits. But of course, hey, they don't get counted as being unemployed if they can't
[2:30:52.240 --> 2:30:56.800]  get on the roll. So he goes, can you get my name in? She said, I'll check on it. Can
[2:30:56.800 --> 2:31:02.720]  I buy you a hot dog? There you go. See, that's no problem. A hot dog. Feed a man a hot dog
[2:31:02.720 --> 2:31:09.440]  and you fed him for one meal. Let him work for a living and he can feed himself, right?
[2:31:09.440 --> 2:31:12.920]  But no, we're not going to do that. Not going to do that. That's not what America is about
[2:31:12.920 --> 2:31:19.400]  anymore. Meanwhile, you got Americans skipping millions of loan payments, reports the Wall
[2:31:19.400 --> 2:31:25.720]  Street Journal, largest increase in skipped payments occurred for student loans. 79 million
[2:31:25.720 --> 2:31:30.400]  student loan accounts are in deferment or other relief status by the end at the end of
[2:31:30.400 --> 2:31:35.760]  May. Americans have skipped payments on more than 100 million student loans, auto loans
[2:31:35.760 --> 2:31:41.560]  and other forms of debt since the coronavirus hit the US. And when we look at what is happening,
[2:31:41.560 --> 2:31:47.480]  this so-called relief for small businesses, it is a balloon note. You know, they can give
[2:31:47.480 --> 2:31:53.280]  you a loan unless they forgive it completely. You're not going to be able to pay it back.
[2:31:53.280 --> 2:31:58.160]  I mean, you're going to be, where are you going to get the money to pay for your current
[2:31:58.160 --> 2:32:02.600]  expenses plus catch up on all this stuff? And the same thing is true about these people
[2:32:02.600 --> 2:32:10.640]  who have been given deferment off of being kicked out of their apartments. Even if the
[2:32:10.640 --> 2:32:14.160]  money shows up, I mean, a lot of people are facing eviction because they, again, like
[2:32:14.160 --> 2:32:17.760]  this unemployed worker, they haven't been able to get the checks because we're talking
[2:32:17.760 --> 2:32:27.000]  about government here. And even if they are able to get that and get back to work, they
[2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:33.880]  may not be able to catch up to this because these are deferments. They're not forgiveness.
[2:32:33.880 --> 2:32:43.240]  Now, you can get forgiveness for your business, but that is only if you pay 75% of the money
[2:32:43.240 --> 2:32:47.360]  that they give you has to go out in terms of payroll. That's not the way things are
[2:32:47.360 --> 2:32:50.880]  typically set up. And the amazing thing about that is that Steve Mnuchin just decided that
[2:32:50.880 --> 2:32:56.040]  he would change those numbers by himself. It was 50% when it came out of Congress, but
[2:32:56.040 --> 2:33:01.640]  he just said, no, it's going to be 75% and put that in. Now they've got, however, a new
[2:33:01.640 --> 2:33:05.520]  stimulus package that they're talking about. The president talked it up during a White
[2:33:05.520 --> 2:33:11.280]  House roundtable, May 18th, said, hey, you know, we could cover up to 50% of a vacation
[2:33:11.280 --> 2:33:19.880]  up to $4,000 for a vacation credit. Is there any end to this? Is there any sanity to this?
[2:33:19.880 --> 2:33:24.280]  You got conservatives are saying, hey, we're spending more than we did on the Revolutionary
[2:33:24.280 --> 2:33:31.840]  Civil War, World War I, World War II combined on this stimulus. The entire defense budget
[2:33:31.840 --> 2:33:36.600]  is about 650 billion. We spent several trillion already and they've gone up to about 10 trillion
[2:33:36.600 --> 2:33:47.320]  that they're looking at. We'll be right back. Stay with us. As men age, they often experience

[2:36:41.720 --> 2:36:47.640]  specials have launched at N4store.com. We were told by the United Nations, we were told
[2:36:47.640 --> 2:36:53.200]  by the CDC and Fauci that two plus million Americans would die, that millions of Europeans
[2:36:53.200 --> 2:37:00.200]  would die. We did not do exactly as they said. And it turned out it was all fraud. The models,
[2:37:00.200 --> 2:37:05.160]  the testing, taking regular depths and putting it in the COVID-19 column, all a complete
[2:37:05.160 --> 2:37:09.640]  criminal fraud. But none of them are getting sued. None of them are getting prosecuted.
[2:37:09.640 --> 2:37:13.920]  None of them are getting in trouble except for Bill Gates, the FDA, shut down his factories
[2:37:13.920 --> 2:37:19.120]  that are making fake COVID tests that show everyone is positive. And despite that, they're
[2:37:19.120 --> 2:37:23.720]  still testing record numbers of people, creating hysteria and saying the numbers spiking and
[2:37:23.720 --> 2:37:29.800]  why it will be 200,000 dead by the election. And it's all Trump's fault. And now, oh, China
[2:37:29.800 --> 2:37:34.600]  had 40 cases in one city. We've got to lock down again. Everything's over. This, ladies
[2:37:34.600 --> 2:37:38.800]  and gentlemen, is the new order teaching us to be total prisoners. Either we expose the
[2:37:38.800 --> 2:37:43.800]  COVID hoax, we're all permanently enslaved by it, your choice.
[2:21:21.740 --> 2:38:37.520]  and set it on fire. I showed the video clip of that. You can see the statues.
[2:38:37.520 --> 2:38:41.880]  They're now destroying them physically, pulling them down, destroying them, and chemically
[2:38:41.880 --> 2:38:47.360]  destroying them. Look at that. That is just disgusting. But that's Portland. That is Portland.
[2:38:47.360 --> 2:38:53.760]  It's exactly what they do. But it's not just limited, of course, to what is happening in
[2:38:53.760 --> 2:39:03.160]  Portland and Seattle and Minneapolis, you know, Chazastan, East and West. No, it's worldwide.
[2:39:03.160 --> 2:39:11.720]  As I pointed out last week on my program in the morning, I said the Antifa flag goes back
[2:39:11.720 --> 2:39:16.680]  to the 1930s in Germany. And I showed a picture of it from the 1930s. I talked about Mark
[2:39:16.680 --> 2:39:24.200]  Hall, who I've interviewed a number of times, did a great documentary called Killing Ed.
[2:39:24.200 --> 2:39:29.880]  Talks about the worst case example of charter schools, and that is the Fatala Gulen schools
[2:39:29.880 --> 2:39:34.160]  that are fully in here. There's the picture. And you can see that flag. It hasn't changed
[2:39:34.160 --> 2:39:40.160]  a bit. It's funny. You know, these Marxists, they still have the same approach. You know,
[2:39:40.160 --> 2:39:45.360]  it's the red flag that follows right there behind the black flag, the black flag of Anarchy,
[2:39:45.360 --> 2:39:52.480]  and then comes the Marxism right behind it. And as he was pointing out to me when I talked
[2:39:52.480 --> 2:40:00.600]  to him, he said he lived a number of years in Germany right after the wall fell, right
[2:40:00.600 --> 2:40:06.200]  after they took down the plexiglass wall. It wasn't plexiglass there. But don't worry,
[2:40:06.200 --> 2:40:10.240]  the concrete wall is coming for us as well. If we don't stop this plexiglass wall, you
[2:40:10.240 --> 2:40:18.720]  better be able to see through what's coming. But he pointed out that Antifa was very active
[2:40:18.720 --> 2:40:24.280]  as it came over from East Germany. And it really was a Marxist movement. There always
[2:40:24.280 --> 2:40:31.880]  has been. And that is a part of this global movement. You know, we talk about the toxic
[2:40:31.880 --> 2:40:38.960]  social media and about the propaganda press. I think the most amazing thing that I've seen
[2:40:38.960 --> 2:40:45.640]  in the last three months is how, with complete control over the levers of information, with
[2:40:45.640 --> 2:40:51.840]  just a few corporations controlling the Internet and social media, another handful, three or
[2:40:51.840 --> 2:40:56.280]  four corporations controlling the Internet and social media, another three or four corporations
[2:40:56.280 --> 2:41:00.600]  controlling everything that you see, both in terms of news and entertainment, they have
[2:41:00.600 --> 2:41:08.120]  been able to, in the course of just three months, push through two, not one, but two
[2:41:08.120 --> 2:41:14.600]  global narratives to control the population and rapid succession. And we're not done yet.
[2:41:14.600 --> 2:41:20.320]  We're coming for another wave of it. And when you look at these monuments across the country,
[2:41:20.320 --> 2:41:27.400]  I mean, they're coming after Robert DeBruce in Scotland, putting slogans, racist king
[2:41:27.400 --> 2:41:34.080]  and so forth. He never saw a black man at the time he was living in Scotland. They're
[2:41:34.080 --> 2:41:39.720]  coming after Mahatma Gandhi in the UK. Article we have at infowarstore.com a couple of days
[2:41:39.720 --> 2:41:45.040]  ago. London Mayor Kahn is setting up a commission to review all landmarks to ensure they comply
[2:41:45.040 --> 2:41:54.600]  with diversity. Now political correctness has taken that level from Comrade Siddiq Kahn.
[2:41:54.600 --> 2:42:02.160]  Why do they bring in these people like Siddiq Kahn and Sundar Pichai to control our society?
[2:42:02.160 --> 2:42:06.680]  Oh, I think you know, that's a rhetorical question. You do know, don't you? You got the
[2:42:06.680 --> 2:42:12.560]  London police now. They don't have a problem with black lives matter and tearing down monuments
[2:42:12.560 --> 2:42:16.720]  just like they don't in other places in the United States. But if you have people who
[2:42:16.720 --> 2:42:21.760]  show up to protect the monuments, to keep things from being destroyed, keep things from
[2:42:21.760 --> 2:42:27.320]  being burned down, then the police have a problem with those people. Just as we saw in
[2:42:27.320 --> 2:42:32.640]  Albuquerque, New Mexico. I think that was where the incident happened. You had people
[2:42:32.640 --> 2:42:37.680]  show up to protect statues there. They were threatened with people who had weapons, knives
[2:42:37.680 --> 2:42:41.200]  and so forth, but they were open carrying guns. And, you know, of course, they come
[2:42:41.200 --> 2:42:44.760]  after the guys who are protecting the monuments. That's what they're doing in the UK is well
[2:42:44.760 --> 2:42:53.080]  coming after Tommy Robinson and his agitators as the Metropolitan Police put it. Macron,
[2:42:53.080 --> 2:42:59.520]  on the other hand, is not going to allow statues to be removed. He says, yes, we will have
[2:42:59.520 --> 2:43:03.360]  a discussion about colonialism and the different aspects of that, but we're not going to let
[2:43:03.360 --> 2:43:13.400]  you destroy our history. And there's an article on Zero Hedge by Jonathan Turley, The Tale
[2:43:13.400 --> 2:43:19.480]  of Two Cities, London and Paris. You know, it's kind of gone exactly the opposite direction
[2:43:19.480 --> 2:43:25.080]  now, right? At the time that Dickens did The Tale of Two Cities, it was Paris, of course,
[2:43:25.080 --> 2:43:30.280]  that was in the throes of a socialist revolution and where everything was being ripped down
[2:43:30.280 --> 2:43:34.520]  and torn up, but now it's just the opposite. As Macron is saying, no, you're going to
[2:43:34.520 --> 2:43:39.640]  destroy history. You're not going to destroy monuments, public art. The response in London
[2:43:39.640 --> 2:43:44.720]  and Paris, writes Turley, is strikingly different. In This Tale of Two Cities, it's London that
[2:43:44.720 --> 2:43:50.320]  seems to be surrendering to the hysteria of the moment. Protesters often faced no intervention
[2:43:50.320 --> 2:43:55.680]  in London as they defaced public art. Later, London Mayor Siddiq Khan announced that he
[2:43:55.680 --> 2:44:00.680]  would yield to demands to take down statues of imperialist figures that he would create
[2:44:00.680 --> 2:44:05.720]  a commission to review and improve diversity. He said he no longer wanted to see statues
[2:44:05.720 --> 2:44:13.680]  and road names in public spaces reflect a bygone era. This is what this is always about. There's
[2:44:13.680 --> 2:44:23.240]  not only people replacement, but culture replacement. Everything must be replaced by the new barbarians.
[2:44:23.240 --> 2:44:27.320]  As Jonathan Turley points out, his history not walking around London is an overwhelming
[2:44:27.320 --> 2:44:33.040]  and inspiring experience to see the response of Siddiq Khan to its destruction and his
[2:44:33.040 --> 2:44:37.960]  plans to remove historical monuments is terribly distressing. One of the reasons why Nigel
[2:44:37.960 --> 2:44:44.960]  Farage said these people are like the Taliban. It was a spot on comment and it was so spot
[2:44:44.960 --> 2:44:51.960]  on that they immediately removed him from his broadcasting situation, which is confirmation
[2:44:51.960 --> 2:44:56.840]  of what he's talking about. Meanwhile in Paris, the response has been very different. French
[2:44:56.840 --> 2:45:01.760]  President Emmanuel Macron vowed to stand with history to resist efforts to stand to down
[2:45:01.760 --> 2:45:07.440]  statues of controversial or colonial era figures. He said the Republic will not erase
[2:45:07.440 --> 2:45:13.040]  any trace or any name from its history. It will not take down any statue. We should look
[2:45:13.040 --> 2:45:20.160]  at all of our history together with lucidity. That's right. You look at what is good, you
[2:45:20.160 --> 2:45:27.160]  look at what is bad, you debate, but these people just want to destroy. So there you
[2:45:27.160 --> 2:45:32.840]  have it. Two cities. One, a profile encourage. As Charles Dickens wrote at the beginning
[2:45:32.840 --> 2:45:37.000]  of his novel, Turley quotes there, it was the best of times, the worst of times. The
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:45.840]  age of wisdom and the age of foolishness, the epic of belief and the epic of incredulity.
[2:45:45.840 --> 2:45:50.360]  It was a season of light. It was a season of darkness. It was the spring of hope and
[2:45:50.360 --> 2:45:59.440]  it was the winter of despair. And so as we look at what is coming for us, we understand
[2:45:59.440 --> 2:46:07.240]  that they understand the time is ripe. They have chosen a period in history that they
[2:46:07.240 --> 2:46:13.340]  knew the population was ready for a change and they are going to manipulate the levers
[2:46:13.340 --> 2:46:22.400]  of that change to their advantage. And the next step in this is going to be the reimposition
[2:46:22.400 --> 2:46:29.400]  of even more controls. And the only way they get away with this is if you allow them to
[2:46:29.400 --> 2:46:35.240]  do this. As I pointed out, Neil Howe, one of the guys who stressed and howe wrote the
[2:46:35.240 --> 2:46:40.160]  book, a fourth turning. They're the ones who took a generational view of history. We talk
[2:46:40.160 --> 2:46:45.160]  about millennials. They coined that term. They said in the early nineties, sometime around
[2:46:45.160 --> 2:46:50.960]  mid 2000s, there's going to be a major worldwide economic event that about 15 years before
[2:46:50.960 --> 2:46:56.400]  it happened. Sure enough, we had the great recession. They said that will set off a trigger,
[2:46:56.400 --> 2:47:04.560]  a turning. Society will be reorganized like it typically is about every 80 years. It's
[2:47:04.560 --> 2:47:11.400]  usually accompanied by massive economic distress and usually by war. The previous fourth turning
[2:47:11.400 --> 2:47:15.400]  was the Great Depression World War II. Before that, the Civil War. Before that, the Revolutionary
[2:47:15.400 --> 2:47:20.880]  War. And they went back and showed a pattern of history about every 80 years, going back
[2:47:20.880 --> 2:47:27.120]  500 years in American and British history. Pretty well documented. And it's not just
[2:47:27.120 --> 2:47:35.360]  stress and how, as a matter of fact. There's a guy who 10 years ago predicted that 2020
[2:47:35.360 --> 2:47:40.000]  would be the beginning of a civil war. Decade ago, Peter Turchin predicted that 2020 would
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:48.720]  be mayhem, including widespread civil unrest. He teaches cultural evolution at the University
[2:47:48.720 --> 2:47:54.240]  of Connecticut. And in 2010, he predicted in the scholarly journal Nature that America
[2:47:54.240 --> 2:47:58.960]  would quote suffer a period of major societal upheaval starting about the year 2020. They
[2:47:58.960 --> 2:48:03.200]  had no reason to believe I wasn't crazy. He said people didn't understand. I wasn't making
[2:48:03.200 --> 2:48:11.240]  scientific predictions. I was making scientific predictions and not prophecies. As a scientist,
[2:48:11.240 --> 2:48:15.280]  I feel vindicated. But on the other hand, I'm an American and I have to live through
[2:48:15.280 --> 2:48:21.400]  these hard times. Well, you do too. And folks, if you want to keep us here on air, and if

[2:48:38.480 --> 2:48:43.880]  are throwing the globalist out of their countries. That's why the New World Order is instituting
[2:48:43.880 --> 2:48:49.200]  race war and division and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your
[2:48:49.200 --> 2:48:55.640]  local police and government and destroying essential services. This is an attempt to
[2:48:55.640 --> 2:49:00.240]  have society collapse. And the globalists, as they've done in the third world, will come
[2:49:00.240 --> 2:49:06.160]  in and pick up the pieces. We must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank and the EU
[2:49:06.160 --> 2:49:10.440]  openly saying defund the police. The police have a lot of problems. We all have a lot
[2:49:10.440 --> 2:49:14.680]  of problems. But this is our government and our local vocabulary. And believe me, once
[2:49:14.680 --> 2:49:19.280]  the globalists have overthrown this country, they are going to put in a real police state
[2:49:19.280 --> 2:49:22.600]  where you have no due process or freedom. The globalists believe Communist China is
[2:49:22.600 --> 2:49:27.720]  the model of the world. And they are orchestrating this entire thing. The people helping them
[2:49:27.720 --> 2:49:34.520]  are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed infowarstore.com.
[2:49:34.520 --> 2:49:39.520]  The globalists want us to masticate. They want us inside our homes, watching our televisions
[2:49:39.520 --> 2:49:44.320]  and being controlled by our, quote, smart phones. Everybody knows this. It's for admitted
[2:49:44.320 --> 2:49:48.920]  goal. We've had whistleblowers from Facebook, Twitter and Google go public and say at the
[2:49:48.920 --> 2:49:54.760]  highest levels, their job is to make you neurotic, destroy your mind and take over your life.
[2:49:54.760 --> 2:49:59.640]  And now the COVID hysteria is all about that. I recently had a woman in the street walls
[2:49:59.640 --> 2:50:04.280]  with my youngest daughter. And my daughter walked close to her and she said, get away
[2:50:04.280 --> 2:50:10.600]  six feet and gave her a super ugly look. This ladies and gentlemen is mental illness.
[2:50:10.600 --> 2:50:15.120]  My daughter walking four feet from some old woman is not a crime. The old woman's mental
[2:50:15.120 --> 2:50:21.920]  illness is the crime. If we give in to it, this is total and complete mind control. We
[2:50:21.920 --> 2:50:27.240]  must expose the COVID hoax. Now they're going to continue to clamp down using this. It's
[2:50:27.240 --> 2:50:32.540]  a UN Bill Gates plan. They've been proven to be criminal liars and they must be defeated.
[2:50:32.540 --> 2:50:53.480]  They must be exposed. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. News analysis reports. It's
[2:50:53.480 --> 2:51:08.460]  the Alex Jones show. And now your host, David Knight. Welcome back. I was just talking about
[2:51:08.460 --> 2:51:16.420]  the predictions 10 years ago in the journal Nature by Peter Turchin. He said, I'm not
[2:51:16.420 --> 2:51:22.340]  making prophecies. I'm just doing scientific predictions. And he said, there are a lot
[2:51:22.340 --> 2:51:25.780]  of signs that we're going to have a lot of upheaval in this decade, declining wages,
[2:51:25.780 --> 2:51:31.300]  wealth inequality, exploding national debt. And of course, we're going to have Nick Begich
[2:51:31.300 --> 2:51:34.780]  taking over. I'm going to throw to him. And before I do real quickly, I just got to say,
[2:51:34.780 --> 2:51:40.300]  you know, when you look at what is happening here and Nick, you know, we're looking at
[2:51:40.300 --> 2:51:47.700]  $10 trillion that is being proposed. We were freaking out and rightfully so. I think to
[2:51:47.700 --> 2:51:54.540]  see that the cumulative debt from the beginning of America until a couple of years ago under
[2:51:54.540 --> 2:51:59.140]  President Obama was $20 trillion. And now we're about to increase that by 50% in just
[2:51:59.140 --> 2:52:04.340]  a matter of months. We've got $100 billion being thrown out for a program to track people.
[2:52:04.340 --> 2:52:09.180]  Another $100 billion proposed to throw out for rental relief and so forth. Another $100
[2:52:09.180 --> 2:52:14.340]  billion program for other coronavirus relief. We're throwing this stuff out left and right.
[2:52:14.340 --> 2:52:19.420]  It was just back in 1977 that the entire defense budget was $100 billion, you know, after we'd
[2:52:19.420 --> 2:52:23.980]  had a lot of inflation. I mean, where do you see this going?
[2:52:23.980 --> 2:52:30.540]  Well, you know, that's the number is over 130,000 per family of four, you know, that's
[2:52:30.540 --> 2:52:38.340]  like insane, you know, and no one's feeling that kind of a life changing amount of money.
[2:52:38.340 --> 2:52:43.540]  And it's crazy money because eventually, you know, things come home to roost and you're
[2:52:43.540 --> 2:52:48.780]  hearing, you know, China's making noise again about, hey, we don't want to suck up any
[2:52:48.780 --> 2:52:54.500]  more of these. And these dollars and you're hearing from the oil producers that used to
[2:52:54.500 --> 2:52:59.420]  suck up a lot of those, you know, they're less inclined. And so somewhere these dollars
[2:52:59.420 --> 2:53:04.520]  have to end up and eventually you end up with inflation. You know, this is the same scenario
[2:53:04.520 --> 2:53:10.900]  of the 1930s Europe, right? It's so parallel. In fact, there's an old book, it's been out
[2:53:10.900 --> 2:53:16.580]  of print forever, but it's called ominous parallels. And it was about this, this same
[2:53:16.580 --> 2:53:20.900]  framing of time, but it was looking back, I think in the 80s and suggesting that we
[2:53:20.900 --> 2:53:23.660]  were dealing with it then, but no, it's here now.
[2:53:23.660 --> 2:53:24.660]  Yeah.
[2:53:24.660 --> 2:53:29.820]  Those predictions are accurate. It is absolutely mind blowing to look at the astronomical sums
[2:53:29.820 --> 2:53:32.940]  of money that are being thrown out there. I mean, you know, we talk about the bloated
[2:53:32.940 --> 2:53:37.660]  defense budget that's $650 billion. And yet, you know, they're throwing out two or three
[2:53:37.660 --> 2:53:42.980]  trillion dollars every couple of months and can't keep going forever. I mean, we're going
[2:53:42.980 --> 2:53:46.460]  to lose, we're going to, like you said, we're going to go into hyperinflation. We're going
[2:53:46.460 --> 2:53:52.060]  to lose the dollar as a reserve currency, even if that were to happen somewhere. If
[2:53:52.060 --> 2:53:55.020]  that were not to happen, then we're going to have to all pay that back. And as you pointed
[2:53:55.020 --> 2:53:58.900]  out, the amount per family that's there, everybody's looking at, Hey, I got to check
[2:53:58.900 --> 2:54:03.820]  for a vacation now on top of my other stuff, but you have to pay that back.
[2:54:03.820 --> 2:54:08.540]  Right. And that's a family of four just in what they dumping in $10 trillion. I mean,
[2:54:08.540 --> 2:54:13.060]  that doesn't include existing national debt or the social security obligations or any
[2:54:13.060 --> 2:54:19.180]  of that, which some say is more like $60 trillion or $65 trillion. And we're throwing, this
[2:54:19.180 --> 2:54:25.500]  is insanity. It is total absolute. It violates all the rules of economics, as you and I
[2:54:25.500 --> 2:54:32.620]  know, and it eventually catches up. And it's easy for politicians to please everyone until
[2:54:32.620 --> 2:54:40.460]  as my, my second grade teacher used to say, until you have a rude awakening.
[2:54:40.460 --> 2:54:44.020]  We're going to have the moment where the music stops and we're going to be looking for where
[2:54:44.020 --> 2:54:48.620]  our chair is, you know, this musical game. Or like I say, it's kind of like the Wiley
[2:54:48.620 --> 2:54:52.620]  Coyote moment, you know, where you are able to run off the cliff and you can go for a
[2:54:52.620 --> 2:54:57.300]  while until you realize that there's nothing beneath you. And once we have that realization
[2:54:57.300 --> 2:55:05.100]  as a society, and once that settles in globally, then at that point, the dollar is in freefall.
[2:55:05.100 --> 2:55:09.660]  And we're going to be going right down to the bottom of the canyon with a 16 ton anvil
[2:55:09.660 --> 2:55:15.980]  following us. Yeah. Choking us all the way down. That's right. Okay. Well, it is where
[2:55:15.980 --> 2:55:21.460]  we're at. We're going to take a break. I'm turning it over to nickbegitchearthpulse.com
[2:55:21.460 --> 2:55:50.220]  and stay with us. He'll be right back in just a minute.
[2:55:50.220 --> 2:56:14.500]  Thank you.

[2:56:52.820 --> 2:57:01.460]  It's Alex Jones and now your host, Nick Baggage.
[2:57:01.460 --> 2:57:07.220]  And welcome back. It's so good to be here on this Friday afternoon in most of the world. Still
[2:57:07.220 --> 2:57:13.060]  Friday morning here in Anchorage, Alaska headed in to noon at the end of the hour. You know,
[2:57:14.980 --> 2:57:20.180]  what a week again, you know, it's just like the insanity continues. And just before the break,
[2:57:20.180 --> 2:57:25.060]  we were talking a little bit about what may be coming in terms of pipe inflation and some of
[2:57:25.060 --> 2:57:32.260]  the predictions about how this craziness continues. And what I would say about that is all the money
[2:57:32.260 --> 2:57:38.420]  that's in the pipeline and a lot of it is stuck somewhere. As was earlier reported, that will
[2:57:38.420 --> 2:57:45.380]  loosen up, that will change. But then eventually, you know, the music stops. And they've loaded
[2:57:45.380 --> 2:57:51.460]  us all onto the Titanic and we're playing musical chairs on a sinking ship is really the best equation
[2:57:52.260 --> 2:57:58.660]  in terms of the economy. So you need to be thinking about that. Do what you individually can about
[2:57:58.660 --> 2:58:05.940]  that and continue to be prudent with your cash. I'd say this also, you know, having my experience
[2:58:06.660 --> 2:58:12.660]  here in Alaska with national banks and state banks and credit unions, what I discovered
[2:58:12.660 --> 2:58:16.820]  in the last several months, we discovered it during the earthquake a few years back, we had the seven
[2:58:17.780 --> 2:58:24.100]  point something earthquake up here in the banks closed, except for, you know, state banks and
[2:58:24.100 --> 2:58:30.660]  local credit unions. And I would suggest to every listener to move your money out of national banks
[2:58:30.660 --> 2:58:35.060]  into local banks that are accessible to you, look at your credit unions, look at who has
[2:58:35.060 --> 2:58:40.660]  accessible hours, my credit union anchorage is open on Sunday, kind of convenient. So think about
[2:58:40.660 --> 2:58:46.260]  getting your money a little closer to home and out of the big banksters hands. That would be a good
[2:58:46.260 --> 2:58:52.660]  idea. I recommend highly here in Alaska, particularly because a lot of the big banks have said they
[2:58:52.660 --> 2:58:57.940]  will not invest in the Arctic anymore. In other words, they will not invest in America anymore
[2:58:57.940 --> 2:59:04.740]  because we're 20% of the landmass with the biggest natural resource space left. And the big banks
[2:59:04.740 --> 2:59:09.220]  who bought bailed out a few times, I want to get bailed out again, there's, you know, this is it,
[2:59:09.220 --> 2:59:14.980]  this is discrimination, you know, when you look at our congressional delegation, Sullivan, Murkowski
[2:59:14.980 --> 2:59:22.180]  and Young of all, you know, screaming about this because, hey, a lot of federal money goes here,
[2:59:22.180 --> 2:59:27.780]  a lot of state money goes into these big banks, and they won't bank on our future.
[2:59:28.660 --> 2:59:33.860]  Time to tell the globalist take a hike. But today's agenda, I want to shift around a bit,
[2:59:33.860 --> 2:59:41.780]  I want to get back to one of my topics of the past that we've not dealt a lot with. And it's the
[2:59:41.780 --> 2:59:49.540]  Worldwide Web as it relates to the Worldwide Mind. I want to say that again. The Worldwide Web
[2:59:50.740 --> 2:59:56.740]  as it relates to the Worldwide Mind, and what am I talking about there? There was a PBS special a
[2:59:56.740 --> 3:00:02.420]  number of years ago, you can look it up, and it was called the Worldwide Mind. And it was a prediction
[3:00:02.420 --> 3:00:08.020]  that was going out decades from where we are even today. But it was a number of years ago,
[3:00:08.020 --> 3:00:13.540]  and they were suggesting that at some point, instead of an internet where we can dial in or
[3:00:13.540 --> 3:00:20.820]  dial out, you know, what would be available is something that you just were in, where they
[3:00:20.820 --> 3:00:27.140]  just could kind of look inside and literally connect the minds of the planet up.
[3:00:27.140 --> 3:00:36.740]  That is a profound thought. If you think about it, the integrated brains in a politically correct
[3:00:36.740 --> 3:00:42.180]  culture. Now think about that. You know, in the last couple hours, we've been hearing about,
[3:00:42.820 --> 3:00:48.260]  you know, screening and segregating what can be said and how it can be said,
[3:00:48.980 --> 3:00:53.780]  and when it can be said, or if it can be said at all, you know, controlling speech. So I want to,
[3:00:53.780 --> 3:00:58.020]  I want to talk about this in a broader context today, and I want to go back to some of my
[3:00:58.980 --> 3:01:04.980]  work on the mind control issue. Controlling the human mind is the book in the video only
[3:01:04.980 --> 3:01:11.380]  and exclusively in hard copies available from Infowars Store. And so you can get those there.
[3:01:11.380 --> 3:01:16.500]  And the electronic versions are available at earthpulse.com. There's links to get those.
[3:01:17.540 --> 3:01:22.660]  Take a look at earthpulse.com. And sign up for my newsletter. It's free. I'm kicking out the
[3:01:22.660 --> 3:01:28.740]  first one in years in the next week. So get on the list at earthpulse.com for the free newsletter.
[3:01:30.420 --> 3:01:36.500]  Integrated brains and political correctness. Think about this. If, in fact, this comes to be that
[3:01:36.500 --> 3:01:44.580]  they can link every brain on the planet, that is a whole other ballgame now, isn't it? One of the
[3:01:44.580 --> 3:01:49.220]  things that we predicted over 20 years ago, we would reach a stage where you could literally
[3:01:49.220 --> 3:01:57.540]  download, dump information, bypassing the subconscious directly into the brain, bypassing
[3:01:57.540 --> 3:02:04.260]  even the conscious, and embedding it there in such a deep way that it was literally programming.
[3:02:05.140 --> 3:02:12.420]  Now the question becomes, in compulsory education in K through 12, who controls the curriculum?
[3:02:13.060 --> 3:02:18.100]  Right? The programming, if you will. I joke about it with my friends, you know, because I feel like
[3:02:18.100 --> 3:02:27.300]  with my granddaughter who I'm raising, Aurora, I'm the chief programmer. See, that's what parents do,
[3:02:27.940 --> 3:02:35.300]  not the government, and not some esoteric weird connection that some moron thinks is a good idea,
[3:02:35.940 --> 3:02:40.820]  linking the brains of the world together in some artificial way. Because what I'll also weave into
[3:02:40.820 --> 3:02:47.220]  this conversation is the reality that the best in quantum physics tells us that we're already
[3:02:47.220 --> 3:02:53.860]  connected in this fundamental way, whether we recognize it or not. And we'll get into that
[3:02:53.860 --> 3:03:00.020]  a little bit. But I want to talk about digital privacy. I got notes today because I really want
[3:03:00.020 --> 3:03:06.980]  to make sure I hit the high points. Digital privacy moves from gathering data. I'm just
[3:03:06.980 --> 3:03:11.380]  collecting it. Think about this. And I wrote about this years ago when we were talking about
[3:03:11.380 --> 3:03:15.860]  data valence and the collection of data and how that would be stored. Never have you been laughing
[3:03:15.860 --> 3:03:22.180]  back then, 25 years ago, because people said, oh, no worries. You know, they'll never be able to
[3:03:22.180 --> 3:03:29.140]  sort that data. Well, guess what? Yes, they can commercially and governmentally. They can sort
[3:03:29.140 --> 3:03:34.340]  all that data now and they do. It's part of the profiling programming that goes on through
[3:03:35.300 --> 3:03:44.820]  organizations like the Cambridge Analytica. It is what the whole age of surveillance capitalism,
[3:03:44.820 --> 3:03:49.540]  which is a great book, is all about. And that's what that's about. It's really well documented.
[3:03:49.540 --> 3:03:57.620]  And this one is a really great one targeted. This one is about Cambridge Analytica. And Cambridge
[3:03:57.620 --> 3:04:04.100]  Analytica actually influenced over 60, I believe, with 60 governments elections before they kind
[3:04:04.100 --> 3:04:09.620]  of got buried under some other corporate names. But big data. So we knew about that, but now
[3:04:09.620 --> 3:04:14.020]  we're shaping it differently. Now it's not just about getting it from all the places you look
[3:04:14.020 --> 3:04:21.220]  in search and collecting your data. It's about going inside and extracting the data. Now how
[3:04:21.220 --> 3:04:26.340]  close are we? We're getting closer every year. And I call it digital resolution, you know,
[3:04:27.140 --> 3:04:32.980]  the pixels, you know, how tight it gets and how clear the image is resolution. Think about it
[3:04:32.980 --> 3:04:39.300]  that way too. As the science advances, programming speeds increase. And when we cross the threshold
[3:04:39.300 --> 3:04:46.660]  and some say we have quantum computing, now it's all penetratable and understandable, interpreted,
[3:04:46.660 --> 3:04:52.820]  and can be collected, catalogued and used. And then think about this. If you understand the
[3:04:52.820 --> 3:04:59.380]  signaling well enough, now you can reverse that, you see, because now you can create the same kind
[3:04:59.380 --> 3:05:06.980]  of signaling that's receptive and can be received by the brain and you can send it in. And so discernment
[3:05:06.980 --> 3:05:13.700]  in terms of how information comes and goes will become a very big deal in the coming years and
[3:05:13.700 --> 3:05:20.500]  decades. And where we are right now, some will say we have the technology already and perhaps we do.
[3:05:21.220 --> 3:05:27.700]  But here's where this goes. This is the very violation of who we are fundamentally as human
[3:05:27.700 --> 3:05:33.700]  beings and it's the artificial system. Think about this as the materialistic version of
[3:05:33.700 --> 3:05:38.660]  reality creation. People who just think we're flesh and bones and this is how we have our 80
[3:05:38.660 --> 3:05:42.980]  years. If we're lucky and poof, we check out, we're dead, we're dust. And then there's the other
[3:05:42.980 --> 3:05:48.740]  school of thought that says we're a soul occupying a body and has a spiritual dimension over here
[3:05:48.740 --> 3:05:55.220]  on this side of the equation. And in the middle of the two are something no one can see or touch.
[3:05:55.220 --> 3:06:02.260]  It's human thought and human emotion. And when you connect the two, this is a powerful thing. You
[3:06:02.260 --> 3:06:07.780]  see, this is when the left and right brain come together, the heart and mind flow into each other,
[3:06:07.780 --> 3:06:13.780]  the material subordinate to the spiritual and you do what you were created to do as someone
[3:06:13.780 --> 3:06:20.420]  created the image and likeness of God. The other is an illusion, an abstraction, an engagement
[3:06:20.420 --> 3:06:26.740]  without power, but an intrusion into the very essence of our soul. This is Dr. Nick Begge.
[3:06:26.740 --> 3:06:31.380]  You're the tip of the spear and this is the info wars. We'll be right back after these brief
[3:06:31.380 --> 3:06:37.140]  messages. Pay attention, support this network. That's how we change the world together. Nick
[3:06:37.140 --> 3:06:43.700]  Begge, we'll be right back. One of our best selling products is living defense and it's been
[3:06:43.700 --> 3:06:48.260]  sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic. We've
[3:06:48.260 --> 3:06:51.940]  got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast. And I want those of you that haven't
[3:06:51.940 --> 3:06:56.420]  experienced living defense to get it for yourself. You're just part of one testimonial. I looked in
[3:06:56.420 --> 3:07:01.780]  January, 2016, I went in a hospital, I went to VA hospital out here in Boise and I was in there until
[3:07:01.780 --> 3:07:06.740]  June. And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to info wars
[3:07:06.740 --> 3:07:11.380]  three hours a day and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[3:07:11.380 --> 3:07:15.940]  Let me tell you something, man. I had an internal digestive problem and I was something with it
[3:07:15.940 --> 3:07:20.580]  for about five or six years and the doctors, they tried every tip. Nobody could figure out what it
[3:07:20.580 --> 3:07:24.340]  is. And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said,
[3:07:24.340 --> 3:07:27.620]  you know what? I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense. Now, I wasn't supposed
[3:07:27.620 --> 3:07:31.060]  to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have a stuff, but I ordered it had it
[3:07:31.060 --> 3:07:36.340]  shipped to me. I got it. I hid it from the nurses. I started taking it, man. That stuff changed my
[3:07:36.340 --> 3:07:40.420]  life. It saved my life. Alex Jones and info wars saved my life.
[3:07:40.420 --> 3:08:05.540]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show the Alex Jones show because there is a war for your
[3:08:05.540 --> 3:08:22.020]  mind with Nick Begich. All right. And please take a look at earthholst.com and sign up for
[3:08:22.020 --> 3:08:27.220]  our free newsletter there. We really appreciate that. All of the segments that I've done on
[3:08:27.220 --> 3:08:32.580]  info wars are linked there. There's a link into a band.videos. So it's important people go there.
[3:08:32.580 --> 3:08:38.580]  If you're interested in past programming and connect the links to band.videos, that's how
[3:08:38.580 --> 3:08:43.140]  people know about what everyone is doing within the network. And there's a lot of work going on.
[3:08:44.420 --> 3:08:50.740]  I want to, before the break, I was talking about the, you know, kind of the two different sides
[3:08:50.740 --> 3:08:58.020]  to the equation, you know, the fleshy materialistic view of the world versus an energetic spiritual
[3:08:58.020 --> 3:09:03.940]  view of the world and then the mediary being the thought and mind of human beings coupled with
[3:09:03.940 --> 3:09:10.180]  emotions. And I've talked about this before a lot because the emotional side you see is the power.
[3:09:10.180 --> 3:09:16.580]  And this is what the left right now is hijacking. You see, they're trying to get the emotion
[3:09:17.700 --> 3:09:23.940]  and then they control the thought. You see that the messaging, the theme that's held in the
[3:09:23.940 --> 3:09:30.820]  consciousness then of everyone. And when you link a thought with an emotion, you have power.
[3:09:30.820 --> 3:09:36.420]  You see, but they're mixing it with a dark energy with anger and violence and hatred.
[3:09:36.980 --> 3:09:43.780]  This is evil. You see, this is how evils power manifests in the earth on the fundamental basis.
[3:09:43.780 --> 3:09:51.460]  This is wrong fundamentally. You see, this is the misuse of what we are as created human beings
[3:09:51.460 --> 3:09:58.820]  by denial of what we are at our rest, which is not black, white, yellow, red, pink or green.
[3:09:58.820 --> 3:10:08.900]  It is humanity at our core, soul, spirit, filling a human vessel. That's it. This is just a human
[3:10:08.900 --> 3:10:17.060]  vessel, a carrier. It has little meaning. Okay. It's just a reflection of something deeper.
[3:10:17.060 --> 3:10:23.380]  All right. That comes out in the oddball looks, shapes that we all are. And that's it. Really.
[3:10:23.380 --> 3:10:28.020]  That really is it. And so, if you miss this and you think you're in your lost and the physical
[3:10:28.020 --> 3:10:33.300]  or the flesh of it, I can see why the desperation of wanting to know what everyone else thinks and
[3:10:33.300 --> 3:10:37.940]  actually wanting to control that. Because they're desperate folks. They're fearful. They're living
[3:10:37.940 --> 3:10:44.340]  in a total fear state because they don't recognize what we actually are. You got to remember that
[3:10:44.340 --> 3:10:50.500]  first. If they would study their own science, but to get to it, even if you know the facts of the
[3:10:50.500 --> 3:10:58.020]  physics of it, even if you know the formulations in it, you still have to get to it. And that's
[3:10:58.020 --> 3:11:03.540]  what I've talked to in past programs and characterizes passing the baton. But I want to give it
[3:11:03.540 --> 3:11:09.220]  more in a concrete way today also. So I want to get back into this. So the mission is to get you
[3:11:09.220 --> 3:11:14.180]  emotionalize, coordinate the thought, and then create action, which is the essence of reality,
[3:11:14.180 --> 3:11:19.140]  creation. And then there's some overlays here. And I want to talk about them. And the ones
[3:11:19.140 --> 3:11:22.580]  have been mentioned before. And I'm just going to list four of them really quickly.
[3:11:23.220 --> 3:11:30.420]  Physical biometrics, digital individual metrics, individual financial data and health data.
[3:11:30.420 --> 3:11:35.140]  Those four to start with, okay? Physical biometrics. What is that? That's your fingerprint,
[3:11:35.140 --> 3:11:40.500]  your iris scan, your facial recognition. All that's being collected by commercial agencies.
[3:11:40.500 --> 3:11:45.300]  You're giving it up on Facebook every day. Or any other way the data can be collected.
[3:11:45.300 --> 3:11:50.740]  In India, they did it on everybody over a billion people. Facial scans, iris and fingerprints,
[3:11:50.740 --> 3:11:54.260]  some couldn't give them because their fingerprints were worn off or their eyes are
[3:11:54.260 --> 3:12:00.020]  gouged out or they're blind or what have you. But there were three layers of biometrics.
[3:12:00.020 --> 3:12:05.700]  Then you have social scoring, which kind of goes along with the individual, digital individual.
[3:12:05.700 --> 3:12:09.540]  So you've got physical biometrics, physical characteristics on your body,
[3:12:10.100 --> 3:12:14.980]  digital individual metrics. That's about all the interactions you have that are digitized
[3:12:14.980 --> 3:12:20.180]  throughout the world. All of your searches, all of your inquiries, all of your bank transactions,
[3:12:20.180 --> 3:12:25.700]  everything that you can imagine that's in a computer somewhere that someone can steal or extract
[3:12:25.700 --> 3:12:32.820]  or give up or collect. Or the rules change and now it all belongs to somebody else, okay, not you.
[3:12:32.820 --> 3:12:38.100]  So this is why I believe that again, your data, your individual data should be expunged from all
[3:12:38.100 --> 3:12:43.060]  files and that you can't give it up for commercial purposes or governmental uses and that after the
[3:12:43.060 --> 3:12:48.580]  commercial usefulness of it goes out, which is the time to dispute a credit card charge, poof,
[3:12:48.580 --> 3:12:53.140]  it's gone. People don't own your data and they can't sell it. It should be illegal
[3:12:53.140 --> 3:12:58.340]  and you shouldn't be able to give up your right privacy any more than say, give up your right
[3:12:58.340 --> 3:13:03.220]  to freedom and become your own, sell yourself into the slave market. Can't do that. You can't
[3:13:03.220 --> 3:13:07.220]  give up your freedom of speech. You can't give up your freedom of assembly. You can't give up your
[3:13:07.220 --> 3:13:12.660]  right to religion. You can't give up any of these rights because they're not yours to give up.
[3:13:12.660 --> 3:13:17.460]  You see, they're embedded in who we are. So anyone who asks you to check the box,
[3:13:17.460 --> 3:13:23.700]  they're the criminal you see and their box needs to be checked differently because they need to
[3:13:23.700 --> 3:13:31.540]  understand what it means to be a sovereign soul as a starting point and then a sovereign body
[3:13:31.540 --> 3:13:37.700]  as a secondary attribute of that. And this is what gets missing because you can't have a,
[3:13:39.460 --> 3:13:47.140]  200 years ago, 250 years ago, people had a sense of their spirituality and they didn't
[3:13:47.140 --> 3:13:52.580]  deny it in the way that we do. But those that do would like us all to be on the same boat.
[3:13:52.580 --> 3:14:00.660]  That is not where most human beings reside at all. So the next piece, individual financial data,
[3:14:00.660 --> 3:14:05.380]  well, that's easy. You're in the system, you're dialing it up. Now they want to change a lot.
[3:14:05.380 --> 3:14:10.260]  I'm going to get into that in a few minutes and then help that. Of course, that might be very
[3:14:10.260 --> 3:14:15.220]  important for regulating whether to get insurance or not and how much it might cost when you might
[3:14:15.220 --> 3:14:21.540]  retire or whether someone even wants to hire you if that were available to people. So data
[3:14:21.540 --> 3:14:29.700]  is important in the 21st century in a way that has never been. To kick in a doorway in 1776,
[3:14:29.700 --> 3:14:33.460]  British were doing, kicking in your doorway, invading your personal privacy,
[3:14:34.180 --> 3:14:40.100]  it's a different world today. Now your digital doorway is kicked in every minute,
[3:14:40.100 --> 3:14:45.460]  no one even blinks, no one even pulls out the pistol to shoot the intruder, which I would
[3:14:45.460 --> 3:14:50.900]  never recommend unless it was a physical intrusion in your house and you felt your life was threatened
[3:14:50.900 --> 3:14:57.060]  and you were immediate danger or harm and other standards under the law for pulling the trigger
[3:14:57.060 --> 3:15:05.620]  in your home. But the point of the matter is it is not protected. Our digital space is not protected
[3:15:05.620 --> 3:15:11.060]  and this is our government's job to make sure that our digital space is not only protected,
[3:15:11.060 --> 3:15:17.620]  it's layered up, that they don't violate it or any commercial interest violates our digital walls,
[3:15:17.620 --> 3:15:22.580]  they don't rape us in the night digitally, it shouldn't be allowed, that's what's going on,
[3:15:22.580 --> 3:15:29.380]  it's a digital raping of who you are and eventually they want to dive straight into your awareness
[3:15:29.380 --> 3:15:37.220]  and see if you're politically correct enough for the modern age and who sets that standard.
[3:15:37.220 --> 3:15:43.380]  This is a very dangerous time, it's one that I've been talking about for over 25 years, 30 years
[3:15:43.380 --> 3:15:51.060]  now and we're here now, we're in that moment now ladies and gentlemen, where who we are,
[3:15:51.060 --> 3:15:54.820]  we need to remember, see it's not about evolution, I've said this many times,
[3:15:54.820 --> 3:16:00.980]  we are what we are, we were created to be what we are, we just need to remember and begin to act
[3:16:00.980 --> 3:16:08.500]  as best we individually can in this general direction, knowing that others doing the same,
[3:16:08.500 --> 3:16:13.300]  being prepared to pass the baton to those that take on the faith that you leave behind,
[3:16:13.860 --> 3:16:18.900]  that's how it works, you see, because the internet, the worldwide mind already exists,
[3:16:18.900 --> 3:16:26.900]  yes, it's what it all is, it is what we are, when the phrase says creating the image and
[3:16:26.900 --> 3:16:33.140]  likeness of God, it connects us to something much bigger than we are to all of us.
[3:16:33.140 --> 3:16:37.540]  This is Nick Begich, we'll be right back after these brief messages and you are the tip of the
[3:16:37.540 --> 3:16:43.300]  sphere. I was talking to my patron supplier, great suppliers, you can now say four weeks on average
[3:16:43.300 --> 3:16:49.060]  for storeable food, it's the highest quality, they've got it, use this little rest we have
[3:16:49.060 --> 3:16:53.060]  caught in the current to come up to the service, get some air, before you get sucked back down,
[3:16:53.060 --> 3:16:58.260]  I personally am ordering more storeable food, I have to now start going into defense posture,
[3:16:58.260 --> 3:17:03.780]  80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense, trying to fully, you know, stop the globalists
[3:17:03.780 --> 3:17:07.220]  and we've given them a good run and I think down the road they'll be defeated, but
[3:17:08.340 --> 3:17:12.660]  we're going to still go down the hard road now, there were a lot worse roads we'd probably go
[3:17:12.660 --> 3:17:17.700]  down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still going to be bad in my view, you need to get
[3:17:17.700 --> 3:17:22.020]  high quality storeable food, it's something you need, we have high quality ready to get out to you
[3:17:22.020 --> 3:17:25.700]  and it supports the broadcast and 360 wins, so please take care of your storeable foods,

[3:18:32.580 --> 3:18:42.820]  and say goodbye to fatigue, that's infowarslife.com David Rockefeller and other satanic pieces of
[3:18:42.820 --> 3:18:49.300]  garbage who thought they'd set up their world government, believe they pulled the drain on
[3:18:49.300 --> 3:18:56.100]  America a long time ago, but if we understand that they've orchestrated this by design,
[3:18:56.100 --> 3:19:05.300]  and if there's a mass awakening, it can be their unraveling, their destruction and them going down
[3:19:05.300 --> 3:19:10.580]  the drain. The Bible tells us that many times when the enemy digs a pit for us, they themselves fall
[3:19:10.580 --> 3:19:15.540]  into it, but God is the master of the universe but gives us free will on this planet as a test.
[3:19:16.500 --> 3:19:21.940]  It is up to us to decide whether we're going down the drain or whether the globalists are going
[3:19:21.940 --> 3:19:26.580]  down the drain. I cannot express to listeners and viewers of this broadcast how important you are,
[3:19:27.860 --> 3:19:34.020]  everything hinges on you, everything peacefully become the Paul Revere you know you've always been.
[3:19:34.020 --> 3:19:51.780]  God bless and good luck.
[3:20:04.660 --> 3:20:07.540]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:10.820 --> 3:20:17.540]  Hey I just want to say I so appreciate everyone on the team you know in Austin and that make this

[3:20:36.820 --> 3:20:41.380]  because there's things that people can do and there's always things we can do and so

[3:20:47.780 --> 3:20:52.020]  but I want to get back into the subject because I got the whole show pretty much today and I want
[3:20:52.020 --> 3:20:58.420]  to talk about where are we headed you know in the backdrop of this concept of manipulating human
[3:20:58.420 --> 3:21:03.380]  behavior. There's lots of levels to this. The book Controlling the Human Mind gets into the
[3:21:03.380 --> 3:21:12.020]  details with over 250 sources and this was now it's a couple decades old of research okay because
[3:21:12.020 --> 3:21:19.620]  what we've jumped is phenomenal. Take a look at this subject and you'll find stuff that's being
[3:21:19.620 --> 3:21:27.060]  produced by the globalists around the world talking about using this way of sort of altered
[3:21:27.060 --> 3:21:33.140]  reality connected to AI connected to the internet and interpretation of what goes on in the brain
[3:21:33.140 --> 3:21:39.540]  for education and for monitoring. It's real go look it up you'll see all the stuff we predicted
[3:21:39.540 --> 3:21:46.020]  it it's here now okay but so is the counterbalance to all of this which is the fact that we already
[3:21:46.020 --> 3:21:50.180]  have all that we just got to remember so that's part of the mission is to remember but I want to
[3:21:50.180 --> 3:21:56.340]  give what's going on okay I talked a little bit about social scoring in the past and that's what
[3:21:56.340 --> 3:22:01.380]  China's doing gathers all those data bits all those bits of information they get all of it right
[3:22:01.380 --> 3:22:05.460]  and then what they do is decide whether you have a job whether your kids get an education whether
[3:22:05.460 --> 3:22:15.540]  you get a passport etc etc etc this is what the commercial side of this matrix does on the west
[3:22:15.540 --> 3:22:22.180]  you see they use commercial entities global entities to collect data in exactly the same way
[3:22:22.180 --> 3:22:28.340]  private companies BS ladies and gentlemen these are the airwaves they're the public airwaves
[3:22:28.340 --> 3:22:35.300]  and they've been hijacked by these people who are making money on our data this is a hijacking this
[3:22:35.300 --> 3:22:43.860]  is the theft of the public airwaves and a filtering of the public discourse it is fundamentally wrong
[3:22:43.860 --> 3:22:47.780]  and it's one of the many steps I'm going to give you those steps first I'm going to read them through
[3:22:47.780 --> 3:22:52.340]  and then with the remaining time we have today I'm going to go through each one and these are the
[3:22:52.340 --> 3:23:00.180]  steps step one feedback and extraction of data you know focus groups polling collecting your data
[3:23:00.180 --> 3:23:06.580]  like Cambridge analytical and their successors collecting it like the CIA and the NSA and every
[3:23:06.580 --> 3:23:11.300]  security agency in the world to manipulate you and then collecting other data through guys like
[3:23:11.300 --> 3:23:16.980]  Epstein to blackmail politicians to run the world to recruit them in colleges even as early as
[3:23:16.980 --> 3:23:23.940]  high school now headed into college for these dark activities get them involved and elicit sex and
[3:23:23.940 --> 3:23:28.660]  perversion so you can blackmail them later and then help them get to the top where they can be
[3:23:28.660 --> 3:23:36.100]  run and owned and too many of them are there right now right now why did trump get elected everybody
[3:23:36.100 --> 3:23:41.300]  knew his sins they were published from page of the newspapers before he was elected you know what
[3:23:41.300 --> 3:23:47.300]  first one without sin cast a first stone you know that's where I'm at on that and we're all in that
[3:23:47.300 --> 3:23:53.460]  boat together but the next thing is controlled speech number two what's going on with the info
[3:23:53.460 --> 3:23:58.980]  wars what's going on with other people's platforms right now that's step two in manipulating the world
[3:23:58.980 --> 3:24:09.060]  and taking over the third is control alternative free media right think about some of the big
[3:24:09.060 --> 3:24:14.420]  networks that have consolidated and consolidated bought out the competition shut up their boys buy
[3:24:14.420 --> 3:24:22.260]  them out pay him money you know sad pale that's what's happening it's not free speech it's because
[3:24:22.260 --> 3:24:29.380]  it cost somebody money to buy all that speech I'm saying that facetiously but that's really what it
[3:24:29.380 --> 3:24:35.300]  is isn't it they're just buying their way to free speech so they can have it all and it's no longer
[3:24:35.300 --> 3:24:40.820]  free so the third step control alternative free press in the fourth digital voting no hard paper
[3:24:40.820 --> 3:24:47.780]  this is a real hijacking never never ever ever they already have absentee processes you get an
[3:24:47.780 --> 3:24:54.260]  application you fill it out they verify things they sent you a ballot with a number you know
[3:24:54.260 --> 3:24:59.780]  okay we already have all that in the country that's called mail in absentee balloting it's meant for
[3:24:59.780 --> 3:25:06.340]  people serving in the military overseas or elderly they can't get out of their elder care homes for
[3:25:06.340 --> 3:25:12.260]  a lot of people that aren't in a position to go to the polls that's the right way to do it but it's
[3:25:12.260 --> 3:25:19.780]  a paper ballot it should always be a paper ballot never ever ever some things should never be automated
[3:25:19.780 --> 3:25:24.340]  the paper ballot is one of them we ought to all be able to go back and grab that match it up to our
[3:25:24.340 --> 3:25:32.900]  stub with a number and not hanging chads with a little ink mark an ink mark you see something real
[3:25:32.900 --> 3:25:37.780]  tangible so you can't lose number four digital voting forget that it's got to be hard paper
[3:25:38.500 --> 3:25:43.380]  transition number five transition to electronic money elimination of cash you've heard about it
[3:25:43.380 --> 3:25:48.820]  before the un has been pushing for it the world health organization because of the field built
[3:25:48.820 --> 3:25:55.220]  the uke luke of passing viruses around the planet with money is your excuse and then you had the
[3:25:55.220 --> 3:26:00.020]  congress the democrats try to push this through on one of these appropriation bills for the helicopter
[3:26:00.020 --> 3:26:06.820]  money digital money is slavery ladies and gentlemen this is the end of it this is where
[3:26:06.820 --> 3:26:11.220]  everything you do has got to be politically correct even what you spend your money on
[3:26:12.100 --> 3:26:17.780]  and who's going to decide that that's a big deal folks electronic money is one of the five pillars
[3:26:17.780 --> 3:26:23.140]  of destruction that i've listed so far don't accept that the sixth pillar of destruction
[3:26:24.020 --> 3:26:29.940]  travel restrictions and significant cost inflation oh my goodness have we seen a bit of that lately
[3:26:30.500 --> 3:26:34.740]  and we are going to see inflation and airfares is going to go off the charts because keep these
[3:26:34.740 --> 3:26:39.220]  airlines going with one person on the plane the tickets are going to get up there right because
[3:26:39.220 --> 3:26:43.860]  you're not going to subsidize them forever now there'll be some great bankruptcy sales for airlines
[3:26:43.860 --> 3:26:48.340]  and so you'd be bailing aircraft out for a few cents on the dollar you reorganize those things
[3:26:48.340 --> 3:26:53.300]  they all get a clean slate and the money disappears into the void and somebody else
[3:26:54.100 --> 3:27:00.340]  owns that airlines and maybe it stabilizes but transportation your ability to travel i can't get
[3:27:00.340 --> 3:27:06.260]  from my state to your state because i got candid in the middle and they closed their borders
[3:27:06.260 --> 3:27:14.180]  and they closed them again they just extended till july 21st i can't even drive out of town to get
[3:27:14.180 --> 3:27:19.300]  to the rest of my country that's where we're at in alaska right now a lot of people don't know that
[3:27:19.300 --> 3:27:26.580]  because you don't live in alaska and we've had 12 deaths which is 12 deaths which is a lot for
[3:27:26.580 --> 3:27:34.580]  any family and any small population but we had 12 here so far but a lot of restrictions you know
[3:27:34.580 --> 3:27:40.100]  so transportation you know now we're getting used to that cost will go up that'll end up forcing that
[3:27:40.820 --> 3:27:45.300]  and then here's the thing that i was talking about earlier is number seven mind a computer
[3:27:45.300 --> 3:27:51.460]  interface as the normal brain to computer link speeds things up see it's convenient except the
[3:27:51.460 --> 3:27:57.220]  thing and it is so and the machine click on it this is where we're headed it'll start with simple
[3:27:57.220 --> 3:28:01.220]  things simple things you can do with your thoughts and then more complex things until
[3:28:01.220 --> 3:28:07.220]  the resolution is high enough to get the whole picture and this is happening as contracts have
[3:28:07.220 --> 3:28:14.260]  been let as far back as 2007 2008 by the nsa you see postings you see links to some of this
[3:28:15.140 --> 3:28:22.660]  on my website at earthholst.com and then the next one reeducation by direct download where
[3:28:22.660 --> 3:28:29.700]  we started earlier in the program right where you can just plug in and dump it in
[3:28:29.700 --> 3:28:34.580]  and that might be interesting for language except when you start thinking about the context
[3:28:34.580 --> 3:28:40.500]  with sentences might be used you know to teach you the language maybe there's a second layer in
[3:28:40.500 --> 3:28:46.900]  there in terms of what's programmed in you know or in science maybe the science story has a lot
[3:28:46.900 --> 3:28:53.540]  built around it you know as they program it in who knows but here's the deal um this is where
[3:28:53.540 --> 3:28:59.220]  we're headed ladies and gentlemen i'll think about false memories from a program in the whole picture
[3:28:59.220 --> 3:29:02.900]  and then go to court what's going to happen to court testimony what's going to happen to
[3:29:04.420 --> 3:29:10.020]  what witnesses represent you know there's a lot to think about here ladies and gentlemen
[3:29:10.020 --> 3:29:18.660]  digitizing images changing the past changing the future it's about that the ultimate propaganda
[3:29:18.660 --> 3:29:25.460]  war exists right now we are in the info wars right now it has been about info wars for the 30
[3:29:25.460 --> 3:29:31.460]  years 25 years that alex and i have worked together this is nick baggage and you're the tip of the
[3:29:31.460 --> 3:29:45.620]  spear it's finally here introducing the new survival shield x2 spray available now for 33

[3:30:34.260 --> 3:30:41.620]  infowarstore.com we were told by the united nations we were told by the cdc and found she
[3:30:42.180 --> 3:30:47.300]  that two plus million americans would die that millions of europeans would die that we did not
[3:30:47.300 --> 3:30:54.100]  do exactly as they said and it turned out it was all frauds the models the testing taking regular
[3:30:54.100 --> 3:30:59.060]  deaths and putting it in the covet 19 column all a complete criminal fraud but none of them are
[3:30:59.060 --> 3:31:03.620]  getting sued none of them are getting prosecuted none of them are getting in trouble except for
[3:31:03.620 --> 3:31:09.460]  bill gauge the fda shut down his factories that are making fake covet tests that show everyone is
[3:31:09.460 --> 3:31:14.740]  positive and despite that they're still testing record numbers of people creating hysteria and
[3:31:14.740 --> 3:31:20.900]  segment numbers spiking and why it will be 200 000 dead by the election and it's all trump's fault

[3:32:23.700 --> 3:32:27.140]  top guys in the country he didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues but
[3:32:27.140 --> 3:32:30.820]  we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it and we believe it is
[3:32:30.820 --> 3:32:35.300]  the best strongest but healthiest energy out there and you're saying that it's made your life
[3:32:35.300 --> 3:32:39.940]  better so that means a lot to me thank you to all your truck drivers we love you united nations is
[3:32:39.940 --> 3:32:46.740]  publicly depopulating africa and many other third world sectors of the world bill malin the gates
[3:32:46.740 --> 3:32:54.260]  that control the unwh show openly say they want to depopulate brown people it is absurdist that
[3:32:54.260 --> 3:33:00.820]  apple and google and nike have slave factories in china the worst on the planet and then a lecture
[3:33:00.820 --> 3:33:05.700]  white people in america how they're bad to black people and now all of the world people are taking
[3:33:05.700 --> 3:33:12.900]  means trying to overthrow police and put leftists in control this is a totally sickening disgusting
[3:33:12.900 --> 3:33:18.420]  joke you ever heard the saying keep your friends close enemies closer leftists are evil and they
[3:33:18.420 --> 3:33:25.700]  divide and conquer people but at the heart of them is a eugenics-based depopulation operation why aren't
[3:33:25.700 --> 3:33:31.060]  black lives matter at cold springs harbour in new york where they run the whole operation trying to
[3:33:31.060 --> 3:33:36.180]  topple statues why aren't they at the united nations because they're controlled by the un and being
[3:33:36.180 --> 3:34:02.020]  directed by their masters you're listening to the alex jones show you're listening to the alex jones
[3:34:02.020 --> 3:34:13.220]  show with nick baggage thank you so much for being here on this uh
[3:34:13.860 --> 3:34:18.660]  friday headed into the afternoon here in anchorage alaska and uh we've been really busy
[3:34:18.660 --> 3:34:22.500]  you're doing a lot of different things and and at the last part of the segment i'll i'll talk
[3:34:22.500 --> 3:34:27.460]  maybe a little bit about that because uh i've i've clued in on some of the projects i'm doing here
[3:34:27.460 --> 3:34:31.780]  but i want to get back to the list and i want to read through the list one more time of these uh
[3:34:31.780 --> 3:34:38.180]  major issues that are part of how do globalists sort of take over in this one and i had mentioned
[3:34:38.980 --> 3:34:45.620]  one feedback and extraction of data collecting information on us next controlling our individual
[3:34:45.620 --> 3:34:50.580]  speech through political correctness and the issues of tolerance where you withhold your truth in
[3:34:50.580 --> 3:34:56.900]  some way now this is wrong tolerance i've spoken about before too i don't believe in tolerance
[3:34:56.900 --> 3:35:04.660]  i believe in acceptance which is the deepest level you see because tolerance is self hatred in a sense
[3:35:04.660 --> 3:35:09.460]  you know because you're holding your truth you're keeping your mouth shut and not saying what you
[3:35:09.460 --> 3:35:15.140]  believe now this is really important in terms of how mind control works in a population in a gross
[3:35:15.140 --> 3:35:21.860]  way in a grand way as soon as you start doing that what happens by denying truth you see that's
[3:35:21.860 --> 3:35:28.340]  what you're doing by denying your personal truth then eventually what happens you begin repeating
[3:35:28.340 --> 3:35:35.300]  what you know is correct to say now you're spreading an untruth knowingly and what is it
[3:35:35.300 --> 3:35:40.100]  what is that that's called a lie and then you begin to experience your existence through that
[3:35:40.100 --> 3:35:48.660]  law this is not right tolerance is wrong it's a trick it's a trap acceptance is a deeper level
[3:35:48.660 --> 3:35:57.060]  it's where you meet people where they are you accept them where they are you know this
[3:35:57.060 --> 3:36:04.260]  what christ did okay with the horrors and the lepers and the destitute and then he healed them
[3:36:05.060 --> 3:36:11.460]  then he forgave them okay that's that's that's who we are okay supposed to be
[3:36:11.460 --> 3:36:19.460]  as human beings i believe that same image and likeness of behavior as well in the material
[3:36:20.020 --> 3:36:27.620]  in the flesh through our spirit acting in our flesh you see it's a deeper level something global
[3:36:27.620 --> 3:36:34.020]  is cannot understand and as you fall into that deeper level of remembering your power begins to
[3:36:34.020 --> 3:36:41.700]  come back you begin to have these bits of intuition these bits of connection bits of discernment
[3:36:41.700 --> 3:36:49.140]  as you separate and become the soul within the body and you begin to control the actions of flesh
[3:36:50.100 --> 3:36:57.540]  and not let the flesh run you you see this is how the programming works and what we're being
[3:36:57.540 --> 3:37:03.540]  programmed by those living in fear globalists if you want to use that term elitist want to use
[3:37:03.540 --> 3:37:11.140]  that occultus if you want to use that you can use any number of labels to describe a way of being
[3:37:11.940 --> 3:37:21.060]  that is contrary to a way of being full as a created human being so what's what's it about the list
[3:37:21.060 --> 3:37:26.420]  feedback extraction of data control speech control the alternative and free press number three
[3:37:26.420 --> 3:37:33.460]  four digital voting don't allow it remember that digital voting and then it then it's about
[3:37:34.100 --> 3:37:39.220]  transition to electronic money which we talked about travel restrictions and inflated travel
[3:37:39.220 --> 3:37:44.820]  costs or is tougher to do or mind a computer interface which we've been talking about a bit
[3:37:44.820 --> 3:37:49.540]  and then the reeducation of the population by direct interference with the brain and what is
[3:37:49.540 --> 3:37:57.780]  that equal number nine total control now what's the defense because that's really the important thing
[3:37:57.780 --> 3:38:02.500]  is what i've been talking about all the last several programs over the last several weeks
[3:38:03.220 --> 3:38:10.820]  it's remembering what we are recognizing science supports this now this is our reality so and i've
[3:38:10.820 --> 3:38:16.740]  said don't another big lie is if you hear it all the time do the impossible do the impossible don't
[3:38:16.740 --> 3:38:21.620]  to realize that's an oxymoron if you believe something's impossible how do you expect to ever do it
[3:38:22.900 --> 3:38:31.060]  you can't do the impossible what's impossible for you maybe and i think we can all say absolutely
[3:38:31.060 --> 3:38:37.860]  is possible for someone else so let's do this let's each do what we know is possible for us
[3:38:37.860 --> 3:38:45.460]  do the possible and then as we do that things get done and we awaken to our own potential and power
[3:38:45.460 --> 3:38:53.700]  because by taking actions that are out of who we are things get done you see and we do it
[3:38:53.700 --> 3:38:59.220]  confidently and then you can pass the baton in different ways to someone else who's gonna who's
[3:38:59.220 --> 3:39:05.460]  got a different mission who has a a greater level of faith in a different direction or maybe a smaller
[3:39:05.460 --> 3:39:11.380]  level in other directions but you know this is how it all works you see we fall into our own
[3:39:11.380 --> 3:39:19.620]  level of knowing and doing and that unleashes and it may be the bus driver for good sakes it will be
[3:39:19.620 --> 3:39:26.660]  all of us because remember it wasn't the ceo it's hard for CEOs it was a carpenter you know
[3:39:26.660 --> 3:39:33.300]  can be anybody all right so that's the encouraging side of all this you know and and i want to talk
[3:39:33.300 --> 3:39:38.340]  a little bit about a project i've been involved in and and you have the problem i know in austin
[3:39:38.340 --> 3:39:43.940]  and every city that's hearing this and it's what's being categorized as homelessness is if that is
[3:39:43.940 --> 3:39:49.860]  the cause of a problem or is the identifiable problem and we're we've been trying to redefine
[3:39:49.860 --> 3:39:56.820]  that here in my region to what it truly represents about 80 percent of that population are mentally
[3:39:56.820 --> 3:40:02.340]  ill drug addicted and alcoholics and i i believe that's true throughout the country may even be
[3:40:02.340 --> 3:40:09.460]  higher percentages and so what's happening is a lot of things to try and address this population
[3:40:09.460 --> 3:40:16.500]  and and what i'm suggesting is a tough love approach and a couple of number of people have
[3:40:16.500 --> 3:40:21.700]  expressed that concern here in my region a couple years ago and we did a video on this it's on info
[3:40:21.700 --> 3:40:28.900]  war band dot videos you can see it done in september last year on the homeless issue we set up
[3:40:28.900 --> 3:40:35.860]  intervention 2020.com to take on this issue in anchorage and and we had a plan and so we tried
[3:40:35.860 --> 3:40:40.580]  i tried for a couple years to actually get people to look at our plan locally and several did and
[3:40:40.580 --> 3:40:46.260]  we sent out a lot of stuff for a lot of energy in it and and what we did is um we're pushing this
[3:40:46.260 --> 3:40:51.380]  narrative that if we solve mental illness we solve these issues and we get rid of the criminality
[3:40:51.380 --> 3:40:56.500]  element and police forces are not geared for dealing with mentally ill people look what's
[3:40:56.500 --> 3:41:02.500]  happening now in all of our cities you have this population of mentally ill drug addicted and alcohol
[3:41:02.500 --> 3:41:10.180]  which mixed in with protests and riots and this is not a good mix you know folks uh this is what
[3:41:10.180 --> 3:41:15.460]  we're seeing you know you're all seeing the mix okay criminality needs to be dealt with now we
[3:41:15.460 --> 3:41:21.620]  don't have riots going on in Alaska because uh that just isn't gonna happen here um might happen
[3:41:21.620 --> 3:41:27.540]  for 15 minutes that's about as long as it'll last it's not going to happen to you um our police
[3:41:27.540 --> 3:41:34.420]  were greeted uh and it was in our paper today by a parade of 100 people saying thanks uh just
[3:41:34.420 --> 3:41:39.540]  yesterday and so take a look you know take a look there's a lot of different ways to handle this but
[3:41:39.540 --> 3:41:44.660]  here's the thing empowered people are what makes a difference and we got involved in an issue we
[3:41:44.660 --> 3:41:48.820]  put some money and some energy and some effort not for any gain no one's running for anything
[3:41:48.820 --> 3:41:54.340]  and we got it all the way up uh to the governor of Alaska and the governor of Alaska is going to
[3:41:54.340 --> 3:42:01.780]  do something he's engaging a committee in the next couple of weeks and um and and we see action
[3:42:01.780 --> 3:42:07.460]  because we've taken an action and everyone listening can take an action about something you care about
[3:42:07.460 --> 3:42:12.660]  this is what i was talking about in the activity of faith acting on what we know to be right and
[3:42:12.660 --> 3:42:17.940]  good as individuals whatever the issue is doesn't have to be anything we're talking about today
[3:42:17.940 --> 3:42:21.700]  but there is something that you care about there is something that you're passionate about
[3:42:22.340 --> 3:42:27.460]  and and that passion is where the magic happens you see because that's the emotional energy
[3:42:27.460 --> 3:42:33.220]  that you can merge into your thoughts of what you know you can do absolutely that's called the faith
[3:42:33.220 --> 3:42:38.660]  and you couple those two things together and this is how the world changes one breath at a time
[3:42:38.660 --> 3:42:44.980]  one step at a time one person at a time because the only way the earth and the world changes
[3:42:44.980 --> 3:42:50.260]  and anything about it as stewards that we're concerned about is ever going to change is when
[3:42:50.260 --> 3:42:55.940]  we recognize first what we are we begin to project differently because that is the beginning
[3:42:56.980 --> 3:43:02.180]  the beginning of wisdom begins there you see is a bit of self reflection so we can reflect
[3:43:02.180 --> 3:43:07.860]  better into the world and then you change the world and the power of that and what's possible
[3:43:07.860 --> 3:43:13.860]  than that as we fall into our full remembrance will be remarkable and we're seeing that there is a
[3:43:13.860 --> 3:43:20.980]  counter measure to all of the evil in the world be a part of that right now because we have the
[3:43:20.980 --> 3:43:27.220]  opportunity to connect in a way that's way different and to manifest in the world way
[3:43:27.220 --> 3:43:32.980]  differently each one of us but we do it one at a time it's recognizing the sovereignty of every
[3:43:32.980 --> 3:43:39.300]  individual soul this is not a group think project folks this is individual committees of one
[3:43:39.300 --> 3:43:51.060]  individual committees of one acting right and true in a in a way that lifts that encourages
[3:43:51.060 --> 3:43:56.260]  that's where we change the world fundamentally info wars is about information we've covered a
[3:43:56.260 --> 3:44:02.660]  lot of details and the footnotes in the published work a lot of stuff for free online on the mind
[3:44:02.660 --> 3:44:10.980]  control subject at earthholst.com but the main message today is you are in the info war you
[3:44:10.980 --> 3:44:17.540]  are already part of a worldwide mind it's the universal mind and we're all connected it's
[3:44:17.540 --> 3:44:24.100]  what we're created in the image and likeness of this has been dr. nick baggage this is the info
[3:44:24.100 --> 3:44:32.420]  war thanks for being we're already in the latter part of june and of course most of the country is
[3:44:32.420 --> 3:44:38.500]  not completely reopened again and already foushee and the un bill mullin the gates criminal
[3:44:38.500 --> 3:44:44.420]  combiner telling us don't go to trump rallies oh no but the very same media that promotes
[3:44:44.420 --> 3:44:49.380]  that we shouldn't go to trump rallies is telling us we should go to the democrat party black lives
[3:44:49.380 --> 3:44:55.780]  matter all white people are evil mind control brainwashing events this is the attempted murder
[3:44:55.780 --> 3:45:01.140]  of common sense and logic ladies and gentlemen now is the time to be more politically active than
[3:45:01.140 --> 3:45:08.180]  you ever have because we are going into hardcore united nations controlled bondage major police
[3:45:08.180 --> 3:45:12.180]  departments like los angeles and albuquerque new mexico are announcing they're going under
[3:45:12.180 --> 3:45:17.940]  you in control and turning their quote police into community activist organizers this is just
[3:45:17.940 --> 3:45:23.860]  the beginning everything's going to accelerate now from this point out so it's here no more games
[3:45:23.860 --> 3:45:33.700]  the new world order has arrived the united states is not communist china we don't have three million
[3:45:33.700 --> 3:45:39.300]  people in concentration camps we don't blow up churches we don't kill political dissidents
[3:45:39.300 --> 3:45:46.260]  and sell their organs but all over the news we see un billable indicates who mainstream corporate
[3:45:46.260 --> 3:45:52.420]  media praising communist china for their response and if communist china shoots women at checkpoints
[3:45:52.420 --> 3:45:57.220]  and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people well then gee we've got to do
[3:45:57.220 --> 3:46:02.340]  that and on top of it cities like san Antonio pass laws saying will arrest you if you say chinese
[3:46:02.340 --> 3:46:08.340]  virus well now qualmo in new york's calling it the european virus these people are out of control
[3:46:08.340 --> 3:46:13.220]  control freaks and they are going to lose big time because we the people are aware of their
[3:46:13.220 --> 3:46:18.420]  criminal activities and are exposing them in their power grab the resistance lives at band
[3:46:18.420 --> 3:46:24.100]  dot video and in full wars dot com spread those links and jam it down the censors throats and
[3:46:24.100 --> 3:46:45.860]  then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much quicker you're listening to the alex jones show
