[00:00.000 --> 00:22.480]  Some seniors spend their twilight years in their own home.
[00:22.480 --> 00:29.860]  Many move into a nursing home, and a select few continue to pull the
[00:29.860 --> 00:35.160]  levers of power to basing the most powerful country in the world in order
[00:35.160 --> 00:41.080]  to protect and add to their ill-gotten gains. The youngest member of Democratic
[00:41.080 --> 00:45.880]  leadership is 71-year-old Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.
[00:45.880 --> 00:51.440]  The longest-serving Senator, 88-year-old California Senator Diane Feinstein, is
[00:51.440 --> 00:56.800]  worth well over a billion dollars. That includes 96 million of her own fortune
[00:56.800 --> 01:02.200]  combined with her late husband's assets acquired from a senator's base salary of
[01:02.200 --> 01:05.800]  approximately a hundred and seventy-four thousand dollars.
[01:05.800 --> 01:11.800]  The members of Congress have their thousands to feed fans from trading individual stocks while serving in Congress.
[01:11.800 --> 01:20.800]  Now I don't know to this second one. This is a free market and people, we have a free market economy that should be able to participate in that.
[01:20.800 --> 01:25.720]  Like her crony Pelosi, Feinstein has opened the door to contracts for her husband's
[01:25.720 --> 01:30.200]  company through the years related to one federal crisis after another.
[01:30.200 --> 01:35.400]  Senator Diane Feinstein's office now confirming to NBC News that she has been
[01:35.400 --> 01:39.880]  contacted by the FBI confirming that Feinstein answered questions from the FBI
[01:39.880 --> 01:44.400]  about stock trades that her husband made and also that the senator provided
[01:44.400 --> 01:49.400]  documents to the FBI. First, Politico revealed that a Feinstein staffer was a
[01:49.400 --> 01:55.280]  Chinese spy, then in Matier and Ross Moore, citing an unnamed source. The
[01:55.280 --> 02:00.720]  column revealed the Chinese spy was Feinstein's driver for twenty years who
[02:00.720 --> 02:06.200]  also served as a gopher in her Bay Area office and was a liaison to the Asian
[02:06.200 --> 02:10.600]  American community. He even attended Chinese consulate functions for the
[02:10.600 --> 02:16.200]  senator. Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina sold between 600,000 and 1.7
[02:16.200 --> 02:20.840]  million dollars worth of stock in late January and mid-February about a week
[02:20.840 --> 02:25.280]  before the U.S. market started to slide and his lawmakers started to get daily
[02:25.280 --> 02:29.960]  briefings about the growing health crisis in Asia. Georgia's junior Republican
[02:29.960 --> 02:34.240]  senator Kelly Loeffler, who is married to the New York Stock Exchange chairman,
[02:34.240 --> 02:38.200]  sold off hundreds of thousands of dollars in stocks starting in late
[02:38.200 --> 02:43.280]  January. Congressional records show Republican Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma and
[02:43.280 --> 02:48.400]  California Senator Diane Feinstein also sold stocks. On Twitter this morning,
[02:48.400 --> 02:52.800]  Feinstein said the stocks belonged to her husband who sold shares of a cancer
[02:52.800 --> 02:57.600]  therapy company. She also says her assets are in a blind trust. If you know
[02:57.600 --> 03:04.080]  that you own, to take your example, Exxon stock, you know that your
[03:04.080 --> 03:11.480]  congressional action when it comes to climate change policy could impact your
[03:11.480 --> 03:16.520]  stock price. And so it's not that you're trading on knowledge, it's that your
[03:16.520 --> 03:22.280]  ownership of that stock disincentivizes you to do what's in the public interest
[03:22.280 --> 03:28.120]  as a result. As a lawmaker, you don't face any real significant penalty for
[03:28.120 --> 03:34.040]  violating the stock act if you ultimately do. They only face a $200 fine as an
[03:34.040 --> 03:38.920]  initial fine if, for example, they are months or even years late in disclosing
[03:38.920 --> 03:43.520]  stock purchases or stock sales in companies that in terms of the total
[03:43.520 --> 03:48.640]  value of those trades could number into the six, seven or even eight figures and
[03:48.640 --> 03:52.600]  we've found evidence of all of that with our lawmakers. But aside from the
[03:52.600 --> 03:57.800]  fleecing of America, Feinstein and Pelosi's mental fitness has frequently
[03:57.800 --> 04:01.720]  come into question. She can no longer fulfill her job duties without her
[04:01.720 --> 04:06.040]  staff doing much of the work. A California Democrat in Congress described
[04:06.040 --> 04:10.960]  an extended conversation with with Feinstein saying they had to reintroduce
[04:10.960 --> 04:16.320]  themselves multiple times. Without term limits or age limits, we are allowing
[04:16.320 --> 04:20.800]  dementia to rule over our prescient present and the impending new world
[04:20.800 --> 04:24.080]  order future. But to be clear, you're not taking any arrows out of your
[04:24.080 --> 04:33.800]  quiver. You're not ruling anything out. Good morning. Sunday morning. We have a
[04:33.800 --> 04:38.480]  responsibility. We take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the
[04:38.480 --> 04:44.640]  United States. Good morning. Sunday morning. The American system has become a
[04:44.640 --> 04:49.280]  country club of decrepit, scamming, millionaire, globalist pawns lording
[04:49.280 --> 04:53.640]  over younger generations that are left to pick up the pieces after the old
[04:53.640 --> 04:59.000]  establishment finally releases it from the grasp of their corpses. John Baum
[04:59.000 --> 05:04.960]  reporting. It's about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand in Fort Worth. I've been
[05:04.960 --> 05:09.040]  here a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little
[05:09.040 --> 05:12.400]  local radio show. I wanted to hire camera people. I wanted to make films. I
[05:12.400 --> 05:16.240]  wanted to really challenge the globalist and it was a t-shirt I designed. The
[05:16.240 --> 05:21.240]  first one mass murderers agree gun control works that helped us finance
[05:21.240 --> 05:24.880]  hiring the first two members of my crew. That's our oldest design and we still
[05:24.880 --> 05:29.080]  sell it. We have that design over a hundred others that will now all be
[05:29.080 --> 05:32.800]  limited issues because whatever stock we've got in that's it. We're selling
[05:32.800 --> 05:37.640]  everything out to find the operation to get rid of inventory. We'll still have
[05:37.640 --> 05:41.200]  some t-shirts in the future. They'll just be limited editions and short runs. So if
[05:41.200 --> 05:44.960]  you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance. I almost
[05:44.960 --> 05:51.280]  forgot. We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com. Every ball cap, every
[05:51.280 --> 05:55.680]  flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts, designer
[05:55.680 --> 06:16.120]  shirts, they're all selling at cost infowarstore.com.
[06:16.120 --> 06:23.360]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance. Live from the
[06:23.360 --> 06:29.000]  infowar.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[06:36.360 --> 06:44.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just kicked off a live 24-hour plus transmission at 8 a.m.
[06:44.480 --> 06:48.840]  this morning with Harrison Smith out of the infowar studios here in Austin. The
[06:48.840 --> 06:53.320]  American Journal and now of course you've got infowarcers truly Alex Jones and
[06:53.320 --> 06:56.640]  then we've got Owen Shroyer in the war room and then I'm gonna be here till
[06:56.640 --> 07:02.200]  midnight tonight. Mark Dice is coming on, Sean Stone, just a bunch of other big
[07:02.200 --> 07:07.880]  guests. David Ike, Thomas Renz in studio, MTG with big breaking news, they're
[07:07.880 --> 07:11.600]  openly trying to bar her and the courts are letting go forward because she
[07:11.600 --> 07:14.960]  challenged an election. They're saying she can't run for office. That's the
[07:14.960 --> 07:18.320]  Democrat strategy with these controlled judges. They've got different parts of
[07:18.320 --> 07:22.640]  the country. Not all the judges are controlled but the different Clinton
[07:22.640 --> 07:29.120]  lawyers, it's mainly Elias, that are going around doing this to frustrate
[07:29.120 --> 07:35.480]  voters being able to choose who they want and that's exactly what MTG was
[07:35.480 --> 07:38.880]  saying they did still in the election from Trump, which they clearly did, and
[07:38.880 --> 07:44.000]  still in the election from American people and so they're trying to bar her
[07:44.000 --> 07:49.160]  and a bunch of other members of Congress from rerunning because she said
[07:49.160 --> 07:53.480]  that they're trying to suppress the voters will. So their response is well
[07:53.480 --> 07:58.680]  we'll just suppress the voters will by disqualifying a candidate and they're
[07:58.680 --> 08:02.960]  trying to disqualify with legislation Trump being able to run again and
[08:02.960 --> 08:06.880]  whether you love Trump or hate Trump, he should be able to run again if he wants
[08:06.880 --> 08:12.560]  to run again. I personally like to say this better but I would take Trump over
[08:12.560 --> 08:20.040]  Biden any day and I think Trump means well but the poison vaccine promotion is
[08:20.040 --> 08:27.040]  almost unexcusable for me but effort to remove MTG from ballot can proceed judge
[08:27.040 --> 08:35.760]  says she's joining us at the bottom of the hour but you see the theme here take
[08:35.760 --> 08:40.240]  Alex Jones off the air take Tucker Carlson off the air remove Trump via
[08:40.240 --> 08:44.800]  election fraud use the Justice Department to spy and harass and persecute
[08:44.800 --> 08:50.320]  the American people that's where we are in the year 2022 and that report we just
[08:50.320 --> 08:55.280]  aired some stations don't care the first five minutes was incredible by John
[08:55.280 --> 09:01.440]  bound dementia riddled crooks run the United States of America will you guys
[09:01.440 --> 09:07.480]  cue that up that video to the last minute or so because first and foremost
[09:07.480 --> 09:12.360]  John bound is a writer and a newspaper reporter that's what he you know did and
[09:12.360 --> 09:17.600]  also worked in TV and what he wrote there about who rules America and what
[09:17.600 --> 09:25.800]  they've done is pure nightmare poetry because it's true about the mummies the
[09:25.800 --> 09:30.280]  corrupt globalist with their insider trading and all their scams holding on
[09:30.280 --> 09:34.480]  to power and using high-tech psychological warfare that's declassified
[09:34.480 --> 09:39.920]  against the people of America to divide and conquer and to destroy civilization
[09:39.920 --> 09:44.320]  it's incredible we're gonna play that in a moment and this Savannah Hernandez is
[09:44.320 --> 09:48.120]  doing great reporting and she's also a posting her work to band on video and
[09:48.120 --> 09:51.200]  she went out and caught a bunch of leftist yelling and screaming and
[09:51.200 --> 09:54.400]  laughing and saying they want to kill babies after they're born they think you
[09:54.400 --> 09:59.040]  should be able to kill babies up to seven days after they're born I mean it's just
[09:59.040 --> 10:03.240]  incredible what the left has become they will sign on to anything they will do
[10:03.240 --> 10:09.240]  anything that's coming up massive news on the COVID front huge massive news on
[10:09.240 --> 10:15.800]  the situation in Ukraine and Putin declaring victory in Mary Opal and we've
[10:15.800 --> 10:22.440]  got just so much to go over here today Elon Musk has come out and sounds the
[10:22.440 --> 10:26.560]  alarm again over depopulation and now it's gonna collapse society and he just
[10:26.560 --> 10:29.800]  lays out the simple math that anybody can verify for themselves
[10:29.800 --> 10:34.120]  Prager you years ago did some of the best animated graphics showing this and if
[10:34.120 --> 10:39.400]  you don't have 2.1 children in an industrial country society collapses
[10:39.400 --> 10:43.360]  within a hundred years if you are in a third-world country you don't have about
[10:43.360 --> 10:49.160]  four children you collapse and so we're we're peaking but then collapsing and
[10:49.160 --> 10:54.320]  it's a very serious situation he talks about the reality and the numbers of
[10:54.320 --> 10:58.080]  that now now let me get to this though when we come back I still got more to
[10:58.080 --> 11:01.600]  get the segment but next segment I started hearing about this a couple
[11:01.600 --> 11:05.640]  weeks ago there was a sabotage of fertilizer facilities a sabotage of
[11:05.640 --> 11:12.160]  food processing facilities and sabotage of power lines and things that it's
[11:12.160 --> 11:16.080]  not being reported in the press and I've got this from very good inside sources
[11:16.080 --> 11:19.000]  and they were telling me a couple weeks ago I need to look into this and I and I
[11:19.000 --> 11:23.280]  didn't look into it because I just get so busy and then suddenly it just pops up
[11:23.280 --> 11:28.800]  everywhere do you know how many food processing plants blew up and burned down
[11:28.800 --> 11:37.640]  in the last two weeks anybody know take a log guess it's over 20 and just as this
[11:37.640 --> 11:41.280]  story started getting picked up yesterday people are finding even more
[11:41.280 --> 11:47.160]  that blew up and burned down 100 percent sabotage now who would be doing I don't
[11:47.160 --> 11:51.440]  know who's turning off the pipelines who is flooding the border and totally
[11:51.440 --> 11:57.040]  opening right now who is devouring the dollar who is doing all this when we
[11:57.040 --> 12:01.400]  know this is the extinction rebellion great reset environmental globalist
[12:01.400 --> 12:06.480]  cult that is the WEF that's their whole agenda how do you think they're gonna
[12:06.480 --> 12:11.240]  get us to total collapse and 90% new population by 2030 I mean they're not
[12:11.240 --> 12:15.800]  playing games that's why you see all these leftist go from William Shatner
[12:15.800 --> 12:21.640]  I mean saying he's even a leftist but he's with the leftist and AOC and Beto and
[12:21.640 --> 12:25.640]  all of them saying everybody's gonna be dead by 2030 the global warming is gonna
[12:25.640 --> 12:29.320]  kill everyone everyone's getting ready to die they just been given part of the
[12:29.320 --> 12:33.680]  story and are told this is coming but it's not the global warming it's the
[12:33.680 --> 12:40.120]  globalist sabotaging everything down the line and lawlessness setting in and
[12:40.120 --> 12:43.240]  then when these food processors a lot of them find out they're not able to get
[12:43.240 --> 12:47.040]  food anymore they go ahead and burn it down for the insurance money and so the
[12:47.040 --> 12:54.000]  lawlessness the insanity that the wild corruption begins to accelerate at these
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.600]  points and we're going into a very accelerationous area a lot of folks want
[12:58.600 --> 13:02.200]  to just accelerate things and see it collapse I do not I don't want civil
[13:02.200 --> 13:05.560]  war I don't want death I don't want to strut around in a uniform I'm not
[13:05.560 --> 13:09.440]  looking to be part of what the globalists have initiated I'm just here
[13:09.440 --> 13:13.800]  trying to warn people and have sanity prevail and stop this but I'm being
[13:13.800 --> 13:20.400]  typecasted as the rebel leader who wants violence and war hundreds of articles
[13:20.400 --> 13:25.120]  yesterday including Washington Post New York Times you name it saying Jones is
[13:25.120 --> 13:28.720]  basically a master criminal Jones you know is being investigated is
[13:28.720 --> 13:33.600]  orchestrating January 6th all of it pure bull we've got that information as well
[13:33.600 --> 13:37.280]  look at this headline Alex Jones reaches out to Justice Department about January
[13:37.280 --> 13:42.320]  6th interview and I guess technically when they call you and then you call them
[13:42.320 --> 13:46.760]  back I guess that's reaching out see how the deception works oh Jones is a rat
[13:46.760 --> 13:51.520]  yeah Jones is gonna spill the beans for immunity no they've been calling for
[13:51.520 --> 13:54.520]  months wanting me to go to DC and meet them and I'm like are you crazy then
[13:54.520 --> 13:58.360]  Marilyn I said if you come here and you give me immunity so you don't try to set
[13:58.360 --> 14:03.080]  me up in some perjury trap I will talk to you guys but I don't know anything
[14:03.080 --> 14:07.960]  about any setup or plan that's on record I tried to stop it and I know you're
[14:07.960 --> 14:11.600]  just here trying to make a case on me and I'm not stupid enough to consult it
[14:11.600 --> 14:16.560]  like eight different well-known criminal lawyers on this and I said but if you
[14:16.560 --> 14:21.160]  give me immunity I will talk to you that way you can't set me up with something
[14:21.160 --> 14:27.960]  I didn't do and last time I heard they said no so he said fine we're not talking
[14:27.960 --> 14:33.600]  to you and then now it's in the New York Times Jones reaches out oh let me just

[20:49.760 --> 20:54.360]  continue live or in the early morning hours right through until Friday at
[20:54.360 --> 21:01.000]  midnight because info wars refuses to back down info wars refuses to quit and
[21:01.000 --> 21:04.480]  we're a family of resistance here and we've certainly had the biggest effect
[21:04.480 --> 21:09.600]  out there the listeners the crew our guests myself as a family we have
[21:09.600 --> 21:13.560]  really exposed the new world order on a planetary scale and given these arrogant
[21:13.560 --> 21:18.440]  monsters a real run for their money and so I'm gonna play that clip that I
[21:18.440 --> 21:23.480]  mentioned from the John Bown report just the end last minute here in a second
[21:23.480 --> 21:29.560]  but let me just illustrate something for you right now things are only gonna get
[21:29.560 --> 21:34.920]  worse if we don't stand up and speak out and the psychological terrorism the
[21:34.920 --> 21:39.880]  economic terrorism the bullying the censorship the social credit score is
[21:39.880 --> 21:45.480]  only gonna get worse so there's no reason not to resist there's no reason not
[21:45.480 --> 21:50.080]  to say no there's no reason not to throw your full will and and and wait
[21:50.080 --> 21:54.320]  against these people and there's no place better to do it than info wars so
[21:54.320 --> 21:58.880]  please tell everybody that Alex Jones is doing a special anti-censorship
[21:58.880 --> 22:04.040]  save America broadcast until midnight Friday with a bunch of special guests
[22:04.040 --> 22:09.160]  and more and when we're not doing the 10 hours a day that's on syndicated radio
[22:09.160 --> 22:14.600]  and TV from 8 a.m. to 3 to 6 p.m. with a war room then it's basically
[22:14.600 --> 22:18.080]  commercial-free we'll be hearing promos we'll be hearing special reports we'll
[22:18.080 --> 22:22.040]  be hearing some new special reports as well have a bunch of big guests and it's

[22:39.040 --> 22:46.120]  there's a list that we're now compiling and putting up on info wars.com you can
[22:46.120 --> 22:51.080]  also go to save info wars.com or info wars 2022.com and then share those links
[22:51.080 --> 22:55.480]  that way it's harder for them to censor links that they don't have in their
[22:55.480 --> 23:00.480]  database on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram so info wars 2022.com is the
[23:00.480 --> 23:04.320]  link to share on Twitter and Instagram and YouTube and everywhere else info
[23:04.320 --> 23:11.200]  wars 2022.com info wars 2022.com and we've had money bombs and special
[23:11.200 --> 23:14.680]  reports before that you had 20 million 30 million people tuned into it during the
[23:14.680 --> 23:18.160]  election 2016 but our other big ones had three four five million people extra
[23:18.160 --> 23:22.120]  tuned in and that's a big deal and so we wake a lot of people up but I mean I've
[23:22.120 --> 23:25.400]  told you this I've explained this there's a concerted effort in the
[23:25.400 --> 23:31.000]  corporate press with financials they got but still defaulted the same we never
[23:31.000 --> 23:35.600]  gave them any information claiming that we have $60 million and $16 million and
[23:35.600 --> 23:39.240]  all of it's made up all of it's pure bull they count the money over the years
[23:39.240 --> 23:44.800]  that went to buy storeable food and and water filters and t-shirts and books and
[23:44.800 --> 23:51.760]  films and supplements in shortwave radios and usually we're only making 100%
[23:51.760 --> 23:55.840]  on something so you know it was supplements 50 bucks it costs us 20
[23:55.840 --> 23:59.520]  something bucks these are high quality so there's all that money and they know
[23:59.520 --> 24:02.800]  full well it went out to all that and they just say oh my god he's got all this
[24:02.800 --> 24:07.440]  money on the news so when you hear me saying hey we're almost bankrupt you
[24:07.440 --> 24:13.600]  don't believe it okay so on my children on my soul on everything I am we have
[24:13.600 --> 24:16.960]  maximum within the company and me and everything about three million dollars and
[24:16.960 --> 24:20.920]  a company this big to operate that's that's basically insolvent the experts

[24:25.160 --> 24:29.680]  bringing in I mean I sold my house that I got as an investment everything to put
[24:29.680 --> 24:33.760]  it back into this because it's a war for me I mean I wish I had $60 million that
[24:33.760 --> 24:38.000]  be great I don't so I've got you so you want to keep this dog in the fight you

[25:00.000 --> 25:06.200]  and I actually got approached by a bank that puts these out and I'm like yeah
[25:06.200 --> 25:09.800]  maybe I'll do that I mean I don't know if my listeners would like that I have to
[25:09.800 --> 25:12.640]  investigate it more kind of like I never promoted Bitcoin for the first 12 years
[25:12.640 --> 25:19.440]  boy I wish I would have and so then I saw news articles about millions of these
[25:19.440 --> 25:27.080]  being sold and this particular company I'm working with sold 300,000 of these
[25:27.080 --> 25:32.760]  at $170 each and now they've gone up in value it's being reported all over the
[25:32.760 --> 25:36.400]  news and so I said okay well we're gonna cut some of our profit out of this but

[30:12.040 --> 30:17.880]  resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program and man our work is

[31:11.160 --> 31:15.320]  and people are really waking up right now but we had to build our own
[31:15.320 --> 31:19.680]  infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost tens of
[31:19.680 --> 31:23.760]  millions of dollars and now with Bandot video getting close to 10 million views
[31:23.760 --> 31:28.960]  a day we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be
[31:28.960 --> 31:33.680]  able to post their content free of charge and because it's become so
[31:33.680 --> 31:39.040]  successful it's a catch-22. Info wars and Bandot video have become a
[31:39.040 --> 31:43.120]  mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide but the
[31:43.120 --> 31:47.960]  expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter hundreds and

[33:24.480 --> 33:34.400]  of the information war it's Alex Jones. In the house like Marjorie Taylor Green
[33:34.400 --> 33:38.840]  this woman clan mom is especially upset with the three Republican senators who
[33:38.840 --> 33:43.240]  said they'll vote yes on Judge Katanji Brown Jackson who's nominated for the
[33:43.240 --> 33:47.680]  Supreme Court she tweeted Murkowski Collins and Romney are pro pedophile
[33:47.680 --> 33:53.640]  they just voted for KBJ. Wow where is Will Smith when you really need him huh?
[34:03.720 --> 34:11.120]  So a double attack physically attack a woman and say she's in the KKK a clan
[34:11.120 --> 34:16.720]  mother I mean what a little monstrous race pimp he is that was a week ago seems
[34:16.720 --> 34:22.040]  like an eternity ago now New York Times with glee effort to remove Marjorie
[34:22.040 --> 34:27.560]  Taylor Green from ballot can proceed judge says for her saying she questions
[34:27.560 --> 34:30.920]  the elections results that's her right now they don't want to be able to run
[34:30.920 --> 34:34.200]  and defraud voters by not being able to vote for an incredibly popular
[34:34.200 --> 34:38.080]  congresswoman who's beautiful and smart and they're scared of this is
[34:38.080 --> 34:42.160]  disgusting and this is criminal and it proves the very thing she's saying
[34:42.160 --> 34:48.000]  MTG amazing to have you thank you for spending time with us where to begin
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.540]  well Alex I think we need to really realize what's happening here the
[34:52.540 --> 34:57.040]  Democrats know they're going to lose in November and what they're most terrified
[34:57.040 --> 35:02.680]  of is a Republican controlled Congress with me there because they've seen who I
[35:02.680 --> 35:07.000]  have been in the minority they know that I didn't join the club in Washington and
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.440]  they know that I'm going to stand up and fight back but then they realize that
[35:11.440 --> 35:15.840]  things will be completely different with Republicans in control with a
[35:15.840 --> 35:20.640]  Marjorie Taylor Green back on committees and pushing my conference to go
[35:20.640 --> 35:25.040]  aggressively after the Democrats and investigate all of the things they've
[35:25.040 --> 35:29.400]  been doing and so this is why they want my name off the ballot it has nothing to
[35:29.400 --> 35:33.760]  do with January 6th they know that I did nothing wrong they know there was no
[35:33.760 --> 35:38.600]  insurrection that is their big lie but they're trying to take my name off the
[35:38.600 --> 35:43.960]  ballot rip it off the ballot using the courtroom using a judge and using
[35:43.960 --> 35:49.760]  bureaucrats to take away my district's right to vote for me and reelect me to
[35:49.760 --> 35:54.600]  go represent them in Congress you talk about destroying democracy this is
[35:54.600 --> 35:59.200]  destroying democracy this is an assault on our freedoms it's an assault on our
[35:59.200 --> 36:04.320]  elections and every single American should be extremely upset about the
[36:04.320 --> 36:09.040]  dangerous precedent that is being set tomorrow when they put me on the witness
[36:09.040 --> 36:14.240]  stand and question me about something I've never been charged with no one has
[36:14.240 --> 36:18.120]  been convicted the January 6th committee has not asked me any questions
[36:18.120 --> 36:23.160]  about it and I was as a member of Congress inside the House chamber inside
[36:23.160 --> 36:28.440]  the Capitol when the riot occurred so this is this is unbelievable and it's
[36:28.440 --> 36:34.360]  all organized by a funded dark money group they call themselves ironically
[36:34.360 --> 36:40.160]  free speech for people well that is such a joke well I'm dealing with the same
[36:40.160 --> 36:45.160]  thing where I was found in default in cases for not giving them documents but
[36:45.160 --> 36:48.320]  they have all the documents and then I'm supposed to have a jury trial and how
[36:48.320 --> 36:52.680]  guilty I am but we're not able to speak at that trial but with you it's even
[36:52.680 --> 36:56.520]  worse they are they are saying okay you've not been convicted you've not
[36:56.520 --> 37:00.240]  been charged you did nothing wrong on January 6th but because you question the
[37:00.240 --> 37:05.040]  election now you can't run for office defrauding voters again doing exactly
[37:05.040 --> 37:10.480]  what you've said they're trying to do I mean this is so villainous and I know
[37:10.480 --> 37:15.200]  that the Clinton lawyer Elias and others are running around involved in this and
[37:15.200 --> 37:18.320]  you're not the only member of Congress they're trying to keep from being able
[37:18.320 --> 37:22.080]  to run I mean this is just next level tyranny and you've got to go into court
[37:22.080 --> 37:27.760]  this is just shameful yes it is shameful it's it's embarrassing it's
[37:27.760 --> 37:32.240]  shocking for our country because here's their progressives these are radical
[37:32.240 --> 37:38.160]  progressive attorneys they're funded by the the same foundations and 501 C3s
[37:38.160 --> 37:42.360]  that are all interested in horrible things things that are destroying our
[37:42.360 --> 37:48.120]  country like illegal immigration illegals voting in our election abortion
[37:48.120 --> 37:52.440]  killing babies all they want these are the radical things they want you know
[37:52.440 --> 37:58.200]  pediatric gender clinic putting biological men and women's sport taking
[37:58.200 --> 38:03.200]  away freedom of speech censorship gun control this is who these people are
[38:03.200 --> 38:07.800]  and because they hate the people in my district so much they hate them for
[38:07.800 --> 38:12.360]  voting for me they look down on them because they love our Constitution the
[38:12.360 --> 38:16.400]  people here in my district love our fruit freedoms and they wanted a fighter in
[38:16.400 --> 38:20.160]  Congress to stand up and fight for them and they sent me there will these
[38:20.160 --> 38:25.160]  progressive attorneys from New York City and Massachusetts have decided that my
[38:25.160 --> 38:28.800]  district doesn't get the right to vote for me they're hauling me into court
[38:28.800 --> 38:33.120]  putting me on the witness stand and asking me ridiculous questions tomorrow
[38:33.120 --> 38:39.200]  actually tomorrow morning at 9 30 and it's gonna be televised live having
[38:39.200 --> 38:44.440]  pressed in there the public's allowed in it's a complete show trial all so that
[38:44.440 --> 38:47.960]  they can raise more money and do everything they can to destroy our
[38:47.960 --> 38:51.520]  country when Alex let's talk about people what people really care about
[38:51.520 --> 38:56.640]  people really care about securing the border people care about stopping the
[38:56.640 --> 39:00.760]  illegal invasion stopping the fentanyl and the terrorists and and God knows
[39:00.760 --> 39:05.000]  what else coming across our border Americans care about the inflation that
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.120]  is out of control they care about gas prices they care about the ability to
[39:09.120 --> 39:13.960]  buy food at the grocery store to feed their family they are shocked and
[39:13.960 --> 39:18.880]  completely dismayed at a president who is clearly suffering with dementia and a
[39:18.880 --> 39:23.200]  Democrat Party that will do nothing about it you know the American people are
[39:23.200 --> 39:28.320]  fed up with our jobs and companies running overseas and and then people here
[39:28.320 --> 39:33.000]  at home suffering and paying the price for all of this failure that comes out
[39:33.000 --> 39:37.440]  of Washington DC but yet here we have a complete attack on our election
[39:37.440 --> 39:42.040]  integrity here in Georgia where they are literally trying to rip my name off the
[39:42.040 --> 39:46.480]  ballot and and tell my district you're not allowed to vote for her you cannot
[39:46.480 --> 39:51.760]  have her and that is that's the attack that's happening tomorrow
[39:52.040 --> 39:56.880]  well I couldn't say it as well as you are and clearly the globalist want to
[39:56.880 --> 40:00.480]  implode the country cloud and heaven to make us dependent and take control but
[40:00.480 --> 40:05.200]  it's so obvious with Biden and all the polls show a total collapse and
[40:05.200 --> 40:10.120]  realignment towards populist Republicans how do you think the Democrats
[40:10.120 --> 40:15.240]  in the deep state are going to try to stop this populist peaceful uprising
[40:15.240 --> 40:19.600]  well I think they're going to try to stop it by taking people like me out of
[40:19.600 --> 40:23.600]  Congress they don't want me in there because they know that I don't serve
[40:23.600 --> 40:28.600]  Washington they know that I you can't buy me yet I cannot be bought I'm
[40:28.600 --> 40:32.800]  literally there to only serve the will of the American people and the populist
[40:32.800 --> 40:37.160]  movement and America first that is it and they know that I will fight with
[40:37.160 --> 40:41.800]  everything I have to stop what they're trying to do in our country they know
[40:41.800 --> 40:45.800]  when I say I'm going to end abortion that I seriously mean it and that I'll
[40:45.800 --> 40:50.800]  force my party to be held accountable and do it they know that I will work as
[40:50.800 --> 40:54.440]  hard as possible and that I'm popular with the people and that I will work
[40:54.440 --> 40:57.840]  alongside the people to accomplish the things that we need to do for our
[40:57.840 --> 41:02.360]  country so these globalists that that are completely trying to destroy our
[41:02.360 --> 41:06.600]  country and move us into their global economy and their one-world government
[41:06.600 --> 41:11.880]  where NATO is telling our military what they who they should go to war with and
[41:11.880 --> 41:17.240]  where the UN is running running the entire world this is what Democrats want
[41:17.240 --> 41:21.320]  and so they know that in order to achieve these goals they have to get the
[41:21.320 --> 41:25.240]  strongest fighters out and that's why they're coming after me and they're
[41:25.240 --> 41:29.560]  coming after Andy Biggs Paul Gosar they went after Madison and they're going
[41:29.560 --> 41:33.680]  after others because they know that we're the real problem and that we will
[41:33.680 --> 41:39.120]  stand up and fight as hard as possible to stop what they're trying to do and I
[41:39.120 --> 41:41.720]  want to illustrate something I want to expand on something you said at the
[41:41.720 --> 41:44.800]  start of the interview just six seven eight minutes ago and we're gonna come
[41:44.800 --> 41:48.200]  back for breaking when you talk about it they're targeting you obviously not
[41:48.200 --> 41:52.280]  because of January 6 you did nothing wrong you're totally independent in the
[41:52.280 --> 41:56.360]  most maverick of a group of maverick men and women that got into Congress in the
[41:56.360 --> 42:01.000]  last couple years and if other people don't join the committees and joint and
[42:01.000 --> 42:06.360]  don't join the club and don't kneel and bow to the neocon leadership then we
[42:06.360 --> 42:10.040]  really will take over the Republican Party will save America the Democratic
[42:10.040 --> 42:13.480]  Party will be forced to reform or a new party will start and so you are
[42:13.480 --> 42:18.480]  literally coffin nails to the corrupt establishment and that's why they're so
[42:18.480 --> 42:23.320]  scared of you that's exactly right because they found something out over
[42:23.320 --> 42:27.440]  the past four years with President Trump they found out that the Republican
[42:27.440 --> 42:32.240]  voters and many Americans independence people that had never voted before what
[42:32.240 --> 42:37.200]  what the Washington establishment the machine found out is that people don't
[42:37.200 --> 42:41.040]  like their ways and they will not tolerate it anymore and that they will
[42:41.040 --> 42:45.080]  vote for people like me people like President Trump people that are willing
[42:45.080 --> 42:49.880]  to stand up and stop it and change it and they they are really afraid of that
[42:49.880 --> 42:54.000]  they're terrified that the American people may actually get absolutely you
[42:54.000 --> 42:57.040]  are a symbol of the populist American that's why they hate you and that's why
[42:57.040 --> 42:59.720]  we love you we'll be right back
[42:59.720 --> 43:03.960]  it's about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand into a war so I've been on the
[43:03.960 --> 43:07.840]  air a couple of years but I only had money to finance my own simple little
[43:07.840 --> 43:11.240]  local radio show and I wanted to hire camera people I wanted to make films I
[43:11.240 --> 43:15.040]  wanted to really challenge the globalist and it was a t-shirt I designed the
[43:15.040 --> 43:20.040]  first one mass murderers agree gun control works that helped us finance
[43:20.040 --> 43:23.680]  hiring the first two members of my crew that's our oldest design and we still

[47:39.040 --> 47:45.480]  patriot very successful in the private sector and she's the example of what
[47:45.480 --> 47:50.240]  America is and that's why they fear her so much and that's why they ridicule her
[47:50.240 --> 47:55.320]  and call her a clan mother and say she be physically attacked on nightly comedy
[47:55.320 --> 48:01.840]  shows because they're scared of people who are fed up and who start standing up

[48:14.040 --> 48:18.640]  smart enough to say hey we should support alex because that's a populist
[48:18.640 --> 48:22.200]  movement he's a good guy he's not lying he's not perfect but we should support
[48:22.200 --> 48:25.640]  him he's under attack she understands the common sense of we're the good guys
[48:25.640 --> 48:29.720]  we're trying to save the country we've been proven right and instead of running
[48:29.720 --> 48:32.680]  from each other and being scared of the corporate media the corporate media is
[48:32.680 --> 48:37.000]  collapsing Hollywood's dead Netflix is falling apart they're all done folks and
[48:37.000 --> 48:40.960]  all they can hope to do is have a civil war and hope we forget about how bad
[48:40.960 --> 48:44.880]  they are we're not gonna forget we're gonna save this country in the world
[48:44.880 --> 48:50.280]  together but we've got to celebrate our free speech and celebrate Tucker Carlson
[48:50.280 --> 48:55.120]  and celebrate Trump he's not perfect and celebrate the Santas and celebrate all
[48:55.120 --> 48:59.920]  the people like Matt Gaetz that's under attack because he's a good man and we
[48:59.920 --> 49:03.840]  have to hold each other up and realize the people under attack on the arena are
[49:03.840 --> 49:08.160]  who you got a bet on because you know they're under attack by this devil
[49:08.160 --> 49:11.200]  system because we're doing a good job and I'm not trying to keep my horn here
[49:11.200 --> 49:15.160]  but damn it I know the listeners know this but we need to fully get behind you
[49:15.160 --> 49:19.240]  and fully get who else should we get behind MTG and I'm ranting here I
[49:19.240 --> 49:23.240]  could ask you a hundred questions but what else is on your radar screen well
[49:23.240 --> 49:27.640]  Alex I just want to I want to chime in there and tell you I fully support you
[49:27.640 --> 49:34.400]  Alex you have been so in front of so many issues and news stories and I'm
[49:34.400 --> 49:38.360]  just grateful for you and I'm grateful for your fight I'm grateful that you've
[49:38.360 --> 49:42.320]  never given up and that when they've come after you like they have all these
[49:42.320 --> 49:48.080]  years you have dug in and said no I you will not take me out I will find another
[49:48.080 --> 49:51.680]  way and I'll keep telling the truth and I just really appreciate you for that and
[49:51.680 --> 49:56.000]  I and I fully agree with you we have to band together we have to be in together
[49:56.000 --> 50:01.040]  because like you said the establishment and everyone involved with it and all
[50:01.040 --> 50:05.200]  the people that hate us they're going to do anything they can to come after us
[50:05.200 --> 50:10.400]  and remove us from the public eye and try to silence our voice and take away
[50:10.400 --> 50:15.120]  the platforms that we're able to talk to people on but we have to we have to
[50:15.120 --> 50:18.800]  come together and support one another just like America the American people
[50:18.800 --> 50:23.040]  have to come together and support one another we have to be no longer afraid
[50:23.040 --> 50:28.120]  to stand up for traditional family values and defending our children and the
[50:28.120 --> 50:33.200]  radical evil attack on our children because Satan certainly wants to steal
[50:33.200 --> 50:37.640]  and destroy their souls and this is what's happening in America today it's
[50:37.640 --> 50:42.880]  no longer the time to turn a blind eye and say I'm too busy I just can't get
[50:42.880 --> 50:47.080]  involved in this or I'm too overwhelmed with it everyone has to get involved
[50:47.080 --> 50:52.240]  because it's our responsibility it's our generation and it's our time to stand
[50:52.240 --> 50:56.680]  up and stop it because if we don't do it it's our children and our grandchildren
[50:56.680 --> 51:01.600]  that will pay the price the ultimate price of us being too busy or too too
[51:01.600 --> 51:06.600]  inconvenience or too unwilling to actually stand up against it all and so
[51:06.600 --> 51:10.560]  that's why Alex I just I really just want to say thank you thank you for that
[51:10.560 --> 51:15.480]  message and and I really appreciate you and I'll definitely be be joining along
[51:15.480 --> 51:19.040]  with everyone that's going to stand in this fight with us Matt Gates is
[51:19.040 --> 51:22.840]  wonderful the Freedom Caucus is full of fighters and there's just good
[51:22.840 --> 51:27.240]  Republicans Thomas Massey and others they're wonderful in the conference and
[51:27.240 --> 51:31.120]  they're trying so hard and and I'm hoping that we see some more patriots get
[51:31.120 --> 51:36.040]  elected in this election cycle because I'm definitely looking for some
[51:36.040 --> 51:39.440]  more friends to join us after November well that's right I mean I see you and
[51:39.440 --> 51:42.920]  they're swinging for the fences and hitting home runs and I see Matt Gates
[51:42.920 --> 51:48.080]  and I see Jordan and I see all of them and and just just I see the
[51:48.080 --> 51:52.040]  determination and just it just ignites my spirit and I think but people have
[51:52.040 --> 51:55.440]  pep rallies before a football game we should have that's what Trump kind of
[51:55.440 --> 51:59.280]  did but pep rallies about hey folks we're doing the right thing we're attacked
[51:59.280 --> 52:02.640]  by this scum because we're over the target we're doing a good job and I
[52:02.640 --> 52:07.400]  think we should spend more time as Christians as conservatives as populace
[52:07.400 --> 52:11.800]  really celebrating you know the fact that we are on the right side of history
[52:11.800 --> 52:14.720]  and let the enemy know they're not getting us down you know because I mean
[52:14.720 --> 52:17.520]  I because people don't people outside Georgia probably don't know your whole
[52:17.520 --> 52:21.720]  background but very successful builder very successful business lady you know
[52:21.720 --> 52:26.360]  out there building up from nothing but very successful and then you got in the
[52:26.360 --> 52:30.200]  arena because you were pissed off about what's happening that's what we need and
[52:30.200 --> 52:37.360]  that's what scares them is people like you getting in the game yeah no we need
[52:37.360 --> 52:40.800]  more people we need people to say I've had enough I mean look at all these
[52:40.800 --> 52:44.480]  parents that have stormed the school board and really gone after them and
[52:44.480 --> 52:48.720]  said these are our kids and these are our tax dollars and you better not educate
[52:48.720 --> 52:54.200]  them with sexual immorality and CRT training racism and all of this garbage
[52:54.200 --> 52:58.240]  I mean those are the people that we need to keep stepping forward and we're
[52:58.240 --> 53:02.120]  hoping to see them eventually join us in Congress and I can't wait to see it
[53:02.120 --> 53:06.560]  happen and Alex like you said we need to rejoice we should rejoice when we're
[53:06.560 --> 53:11.000]  being attacked when we're being persecuted by evil people why should we feel
[53:11.000 --> 53:15.000]  embarrassed and why should we allow it to get us down we need to call each other
[53:15.000 --> 53:19.360]  text each other and just support one another you know Tucker Carlson you
[53:19.360 --> 53:23.920]  mentioned him he's constantly under attack they hate him he stepped out of
[53:23.920 --> 53:27.600]  the he stepped out of line he's not preaching the talking points anymore and
[53:27.600 --> 53:32.240]  he's not going a hundred percent born again he's born again hard as they say
[53:32.240 --> 53:36.840]  in full metal jaggedy he gets the whole thing now they are scared as hell yeah
[53:36.840 --> 53:42.320]  they should be because he's he's saying exactly what people at home think and
[53:42.320 --> 53:46.640]  feel and that's what you're doing to Alex and I love those t-shirts Alex
[53:46.640 --> 53:51.800]  Jones was right I need one I definitely want to wear one and and I'm so thankful
[53:51.800 --> 53:56.160]  that you have been right so many times and you know and I'm fighting as hard as
[53:56.160 --> 54:01.520]  I can in Congress alongside my allies in Congress and we will not give up we'll
[54:01.520 --> 54:05.760]  never quit we'll never stop but we really appreciate it when we hear from
[54:05.760 --> 54:09.520]  people at home that call us and send us letters and tell us that they're praying
[54:09.520 --> 54:13.960]  for us or send us donations like absolutely we're helping me with with my
[54:13.960 --> 54:18.520]  lawsuit here that I'm having to pay attorneys and defend myself from from a
[54:18.520 --> 54:23.800]  ridiculous lie oh let me tell you this is great if anyone wants to donate it's
[54:23.800 --> 54:30.640]  mtg4america.com mtg4america.com you'll help me get through this trial and help
[54:30.640 --> 54:35.120]  me fight back but guess what this is so crazy this attorney group that is
[54:35.120 --> 54:40.040]  totally funded by you know the George Soros style dark money groups they they
[54:40.040 --> 54:45.920]  could only find five voters in my district out of over 700,000 people they
[54:45.920 --> 54:52.120]  found five that they were able to get to to do this candidacy challenge against
[54:52.120 --> 54:57.240]  me and guess what one of them happens to be the Democrat district chair of my
[54:57.240 --> 55:05.520]  district so you can see that's a huge political motivation explain to
[55:05.520 --> 55:10.040]  listeners how on earth they can have a challenge so you can't run for office I
[55:10.040 --> 55:13.200]  mean the Democrats are doing that exactly what we said they're doing trying
[55:13.200 --> 55:17.120]  to stop voters in 10 and you're having to spend all this money to battle them
[55:17.120 --> 55:20.880]  and they have Democrat chairpersons are the witnesses against you how the hell
[55:20.880 --> 55:25.800]  does that work explain it well that's called dirty politics and politics is a
[55:25.800 --> 55:29.960]  bloodsport but let me tell you something to can play that game Alex here's what
[55:29.960 --> 55:34.320]  everyone needs to know anyone in any state you can challenge your
[55:34.320 --> 55:38.160]  representative your senator your congressperson you can challenge their
[55:38.160 --> 55:42.520]  candidacy qualifications typical qualifications are do you live in the
[55:42.520 --> 55:47.080]  state how old you are things like that but come to find out if you think that
[55:47.080 --> 55:51.600]  your representative or senator is guilty of insurrection let's give some
[55:51.600 --> 55:55.800]  examples shall we let's talk about Maxine waters going and citing a riot in
[55:55.800 --> 56:00.080]  Minnesota let's talk about Ilhan Omar and Kamala Harris sharing the Minnesota
[56:00.080 --> 56:04.240]  Freedom Fund bail bond link so criminal rioters could be bailed out to go back
[56:04.240 --> 56:08.600]  in the city streets and actually declare insurrection as they were attacking
[56:08.600 --> 56:12.800]  federal buildings and courthouses and police officers night after night and
[56:12.800 --> 56:17.520]  those BLM riots so if anyone listening to this show right now if you think that
[56:17.520 --> 56:21.280]  someone that happens to be on your ballot needs to be challenged for perhaps
[56:21.280 --> 56:26.200]  insurrection you can do that too and you can turn the tables and they don't you
[56:26.200 --> 56:30.040]  don't have to just let people go after Republicans like me Republican can
[56:30.040 --> 56:34.600]  vote or Republican voters can take it to Democrats that's right what's good for
[56:34.600 --> 56:38.560]  the good they drew first blood and so when they're really communist and
[56:38.560 --> 56:41.920]  antifa that want to overthrow and attack and they're running for office when they
[56:41.920 --> 56:45.400]  got bailed out by the vice president for burning down buildings in homeless
[56:45.400 --> 56:48.960]  shelters we can actually go after them when they are insurrectionists and do it
[56:48.960 --> 56:53.360]  to them and then they can't complain because they try to do it to you that's
[56:53.360 --> 56:58.880]  right because you know what exactly like you said we can turn the tables we can
[56:58.880 --> 57:02.880]  play the same game and it's time to start doing it it's time to stop being
[57:02.880 --> 57:07.120]  taken constantly taking the high road while these people are literally trying
[57:07.120 --> 57:12.840]  to kill us they will do anything they will lie cheat and steal to get power and
[57:12.840 --> 57:16.320]  so we need it we need to hold these people accountable and teach them and
[57:16.320 --> 57:20.880]  give them a little pace to their own medicine well MTG at MTG for America on
[57:20.880 --> 57:25.200]  get her green dot house dot gov and then what's that other website for people to

[1:01:04.200 --> 1:01:08.760]  encourage they they take a lot of planning they take a lot of focus and
[1:01:08.760 --> 1:01:15.400]  they take a lot of money and most revolutionaries rob banks and kidnap
[1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:23.520]  people and you know do all sorts of really hardcore stuff to win a war I'm
[1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:28.800]  not doing any of that I am selling products in the free market system that
[1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:33.840]  America affords me to fund my operation from the grassroots instead of from
[1:01:33.840 --> 1:01:38.960]  George Soros the new order I could have snapped my fingers years ago and instantly
[1:01:38.960 --> 1:01:44.240]  joined their cohort but I love God and I love you and I love myself my family and
[1:01:44.240 --> 1:01:49.640]  I'm not shelling my soul for a little bit of short power and I look at these
[1:01:49.640 --> 1:01:53.160]  globals how unhappy they are and how soulless it's all an illusion it's all
[1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:56.840]  fraud but I can't stay on air without your support and you've seen that we've
[1:01:56.840 --> 1:02:00.880]  declared limited bankruptcy reorganization we're totally maxed out we
[1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:04.080]  don't have all this money the mainstream media and others are lying about they
[1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:07.360]  put those stories out thousands of articles a week telling you that I've
[1:02:07.360 --> 1:02:13.120]  got all this money lying because why they don't want you to support us because
[1:02:13.120 --> 1:02:16.480]  they actually have our financials through discovery and know we're on the
[1:02:16.480 --> 1:02:21.400]  verge of shutting down but it's very simple if we get a few million dollars
[1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:25.840]  in that will allow me to be able to buy product out into the future pay our
[1:02:25.840 --> 1:02:30.160]  legal bills keep the crew employed and operate for the next year that's the
[1:02:30.160 --> 1:02:35.120]  underage we've got right now and I need to see that money to come in so that I
[1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:38.640]  can make those purchases and do those things and have that planning show we
[1:02:38.640 --> 1:02:42.720]  can continue on with what we're doing and a lot of other really exciting stuff
[1:02:42.720 --> 1:02:47.160]  that's a few months behind but is nine months pregnant I mean we've got
[1:02:47.160 --> 1:02:53.720]  incredible stuff in store for you scouts honor on my soul we need to complete

[1:06:25.560 --> 1:06:33.200]  all right we're now into our number two of the embattled info wars operation I
[1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:38.000]  am here host alex jones we have a special guest joining us coming up in the
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:42.800]  next segment and I've got all this huge news to hit I've got the military news
[1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:49.560]  the economic news that the over 20 major food packing meat packing factories
[1:06:49.560 --> 1:06:55.960]  blowing up burning up all over the US we've got that insane mystery we've got
[1:06:55.960 --> 1:07:01.560]  a lot to cover here today but I wanted to hit two things that I saw in info
[1:07:01.560 --> 1:07:08.720]  wars.com this morning when I was up at 5 a.m. doing research and the first one
[1:07:08.720 --> 1:07:12.800]  is a little Darren McBrain piece he's put out that just shows the insanity of
[1:07:12.800 --> 1:07:17.880]  these people beware of these four words this is Brian Stelter and others shows
[1:07:17.880 --> 1:07:22.680]  the New York Times saying do not do your own research do not ask questions those
[1:07:22.680 --> 1:07:26.200]  are headlines I've got a whole stack here saying dictators are good freedoms
[1:07:26.200 --> 1:07:31.200]  bad I'll show you that in a minute I mean my jobs not hard now to prove they're
[1:07:31.200 --> 1:07:34.800]  evil but see they want us off the air so they can cut your food and water off
[1:07:34.800 --> 1:07:38.920]  with social credit scores and new lockdowns and make you accept that like
[1:07:38.920 --> 1:07:44.320]  they're doing in Shanghai China right now so beware of these four words here it
[1:07:44.320 --> 1:07:50.520]  is four words four little words that are hurting America's pandemic response
[1:07:50.520 --> 1:07:55.960]  but are they do your own research can we all stop saying I need to do my own
[1:07:55.960 --> 1:08:01.680]  research nobody who's saying that is getting in the lab and doing tests at
[1:08:01.680 --> 1:08:05.920]  best you're reading other people's research and more likely you're probably
[1:08:05.920 --> 1:08:10.000]  reading a tweet about a headline about a blog post about someone else's research
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:14.400]  that phrase doing research popping up a lot in conversations about coronavirus
[1:08:14.400 --> 1:08:18.240]  and about COVID vaccines but this going alone approach doing your own research
[1:08:18.240 --> 1:08:21.880]  it seems so innocent but it can have serious consequences in other words
[1:08:21.880 --> 1:08:26.400]  CNN says don't do your own research what are the roots of this phrase I feel like
[1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:31.880]  I used to hear it around Q and on well today the dear antler guy was sentenced
[1:08:31.880 --> 1:08:39.820]  to 41 months in prison for his role in the Capitol riots the same phrase do
[1:08:39.820 --> 1:08:43.720]  your research is being peddled by some people who do have ill intent who want
[1:08:43.720 --> 1:08:48.080]  to push you down certain paths who want to either for profit reasons or for
[1:08:48.080 --> 1:08:51.880]  geopolitical reasons want to make sure that you are reading certain
[1:08:51.880 --> 1:09:00.360]  information as opposed to listening to authoritative sources so what should be
[1:09:00.360 --> 1:09:05.080]  an actually smart idea especially in the US was such a lack of funding and
[1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:09.320]  media literacy and all of these issues it can really actually help make things
[1:09:09.320 --> 1:09:13.400]  worse yeah it's a sneaky little phrase here's the four words that are helping
[1:09:13.400 --> 1:09:18.600]  to spread vaccine misinformation are you ready for you CNN here they are do your
[1:09:18.600 --> 1:09:23.280]  own research do your own research do your own research it's a sneaky little
[1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:27.840]  phrase that's right folks see it in here to tell you don't look into these
[1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:31.520]  things for yourself don't do your own research don't question anything just
[1:09:31.520 --> 1:09:36.120]  listen and obey he could have undermined the messaging so much that he can
[1:09:36.120 --> 1:09:41.160]  actually control right exactly what people think and that is the that is
[1:09:41.160 --> 1:09:46.840]  our job once again the media is clamoring to tell you to stop looking
[1:09:46.840 --> 1:09:50.560]  into stuff for yourself do your own research those four words are hurting
[1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:54.520]  the US pandemic response CNN chief media correspondent Brian Stelter said on
[1:09:54.520 --> 1:09:59.360]  reliable sources Sunday Brian Stelter visits school kids to teach them to spot
[1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:03.040]  misinformation he's telling them don't even trust satire don't trust anything
[1:10:03.040 --> 1:10:10.240]  but CNN reducing a liar's reach is not the same as censoring freedom of speech
[1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:17.200]  that video went up yesterday and it's got a quarter million views it needs 10
[1:10:17.200 --> 1:10:21.160]  million views to save America in the world beware of these four words in the
[1:10:21.160 --> 1:10:24.720]  Darren McBreen section of Band-Aid video or I'm gonna have it posted to the
[1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:28.280]  front page of infowars.com again and under the live show feed of my
[1:10:28.280 --> 1:10:33.880]  broadcast today we are going to have it reposted there as well I mean that is
[1:10:33.880 --> 1:10:37.640]  just insane and I've got the New York Times the Washington Post all of them
[1:10:37.640 --> 1:10:43.080]  saying don't do your own research don't question just do what we say hey when
[1:10:43.080 --> 1:10:50.640]  somebody's doing that you're in a cult okay okay I mean it you know I'm not
[1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:54.960]  making this up you know let me show a few headlines right here
[1:10:54.960 --> 1:11:00.040]  Washington Post it's time to give these elites a bigger say in choosing the
[1:11:00.040 --> 1:11:07.960]  president look at that democracy works better when there's less of it financial
[1:11:07.960 --> 1:11:14.800]  times of London Bloomberg to save democracy we need a few good dictators
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:23.780]  these are not the good people folks these are the bad people now Savannah
[1:11:23.780 --> 1:11:29.840]  Hernandez it does a great job for truth social with Trump she also doesn't
[1:11:29.840 --> 1:11:34.760]  work with us again we love her she first got her start here with us and she's
[1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:40.080]  posting all of her great work to Band-Aid video and there's a larger edit of
[1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:43.760]  this it's like an hour of it I'm just gonna play a few minutes of it hundreds
[1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:47.960]  of women on video saying I want to kill babies after they're born it's my right
[1:11:47.960 --> 1:11:51.080]  I mean these people are disconnected from reality they're basically soulless
[1:11:51.080 --> 1:11:54.680]  they're in a trance and just regurgitating whatever the new talking
[1:11:54.680 --> 1:12:02.000]  point is like oh the new thing is kill babies after they're born okay and then
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:05.080]  now that's the new received knowledge with multiple states passing laws they
[1:12:05.080 --> 1:12:08.720]  can do that I mean and now it's kill the old people it's kill everybody so the
[1:12:08.720 --> 1:12:12.760]  report is on Savannah Hernandez's section on Band-Aid video just go to Band-Aid
[1:12:12.760 --> 1:12:15.440]  video click the left hand corner you'll see a bunch of the great channels and
[1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:20.160]  that's also post on infowars.com the pro-abortion crowd is out of control
[1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:25.200]  that's a great headline but it's just be pro-abortionist or liberals call for
[1:12:25.200 --> 1:12:28.560]  killing babies up to seven days after birth I mean that's really what it is
[1:12:28.560 --> 1:12:33.400]  and again has 28,000 views went up yesterday it needs a hundred million
[1:12:33.400 --> 1:12:38.480]  views look at these people these are feminine women where is their maternal
[1:12:38.480 --> 1:12:42.600]  instinct well it's been driven out of them here they are this is Savannah
[1:12:42.600 --> 1:12:47.280]  Hernandez here in Venice Beach now California is trying to pass a bill to
[1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:51.640]  legalize infanticide seven days post birth let's go see what Californians
[1:12:51.640 --> 1:12:55.800]  think of the bill so I prefer that most women make the decisions at eight weeks
[1:12:55.800 --> 1:13:01.880]  but if but I'm also in support of ten months out of the womb so you think
[1:13:01.880 --> 1:13:06.480]  babies should be aborted ten months after they're born if if the mother wants
[1:13:06.480 --> 1:13:13.560]  to yes I think them kids so if like you want to get a late-term abortion like
[1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:17.680]  that's up to you you know I've had an abortion too and it's it's it was my
[1:13:17.680 --> 1:13:21.960]  choice and I'm happy I had that choice if you if you're talking about like post
[1:13:21.960 --> 1:13:26.520]  birth that's not considered an abortion like you could look up abortion in the
[1:13:26.520 --> 1:13:31.480]  dictionary what if you considered murder at that point I mean if somebody if
[1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:35.600]  somebody were to you know abandon their child in the dumpster they would be and
[1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:39.280]  they were found like yes they would be charged like there are actual cases of
[1:13:39.280 --> 1:13:43.440]  that happening that's child neglect and anyone who's putting their child
[1:13:43.440 --> 1:13:49.080]  in harm's way like I think there should be definitely like things put in place
[1:13:49.080 --> 1:13:53.280]  to make sure that children are safe anything that is you know pre-birth
[1:13:53.280 --> 1:13:59.920]  if it involves termination of a fetus that's considered an abortion I 100%
[1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:04.680]  support it I've had an abortion myself I'm not a bad person because I made the
[1:14:04.680 --> 1:14:08.600]  choice that was right for me and now I have a life that I enjoy and I wouldn't
[1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:14.000]  take it back would you guys get an abortion again yes 100 times I do it
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:18.320]  multiple times until I feel that I'm ready parent that's the choice I'll
[1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:21.840]  continue to make so basically like if they have their baby they can neglect
[1:14:21.840 --> 1:14:25.640]  them for seven days and if the baby dies then they can't be held criminally
[1:14:25.640 --> 1:14:32.560]  liable what do you think yeah I mean I think like I agree I think whatever like
[1:14:32.560 --> 1:14:37.280]  helps women and helps them achieve their like dreams and however that needs to
[1:14:37.280 --> 1:14:43.280]  like happen is definitely acts to help that is helping all of us so they sell
[1:14:43.280 --> 1:14:47.280]  these women on your getting ahead in life now you can kill your baby after
[1:14:47.280 --> 1:14:51.280]  it's born they're like yeah I want to have fun I want to do you think in a
[1:14:51.280 --> 1:14:55.400]  world like that you're gonna be safe sweetheart do you think in a world like
[1:14:55.400 --> 1:15:00.320]  that there's gonna be a civilization they don't know and they're led by
[1:15:00.320 --> 1:15:04.120]  Hollywood and led by the corporate culture and you sit there and you look
[1:15:04.120 --> 1:15:08.040]  at these women and no matter how attractive they are those at the end are

[1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:22.560]  millions of dollars and now with Band-Aid video getting close to 10 million
[1:17:22.560 --> 1:17:27.000]  views a day we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:32.200]  groups to be able to post their content free of charge and because it's
[1:17:32.200 --> 1:17:38.080]  become so successful it's a catch-22. Info wars and Band-Aid video have become a
[1:17:38.080 --> 1:17:42.160]  mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide but the
[1:17:42.160 --> 1:17:47.000]  expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter hundreds and
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:50.480]  hundreds of thousands of dollars a month so the biggest sale in info wars
[1:17:50.480 --> 1:17:54.720]  history is going right now the mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off

[1:17:58.880 --> 1:18:03.840]  fact and I'm not bragging when I say it it's just true that info wars is seen by
[1:18:03.840 --> 1:18:11.000]  the globalist as the standard of human liberty as the logo of human populist
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:16.840]  resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program and man our work is
[1:18:16.840 --> 1:18:22.320]  really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever

[1:20:56.640 --> 1:21:00.640]  really happening and really been ahead of the curve exposing fiser and maderna
[1:21:00.640 --> 1:21:04.840]  I wanted to get his take in studio on where that fight is and where we're
[1:21:04.840 --> 1:21:08.440]  going with this biomedical tyranny but you also wanted to get into know a
[1:21:08.440 --> 1:21:13.160]  harari you wanted to get into the food shortages the shutdowns that are
[1:21:13.160 --> 1:21:15.840]  happening and the whole great research great to have you here brother and
[1:21:15.840 --> 1:21:19.120]  thanks for the support oh man I'm so glad to be here alex we're not honored to
[1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:26.160]  be in the studio with you and man listen I want to plug support alex jones man if
[1:21:26.160 --> 1:21:30.600]  you're watching this this guy's been getting the truth out for years you got
[1:21:30.600 --> 1:21:34.880]  to support this guy don't just say hey I want to make a difference and then not
[1:21:34.880 --> 1:21:39.880]  do anything support this guy this all takes money to do we got to support our
[1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:43.560]  freedom fighters well they're coming out to everybody right now and trying to
[1:21:43.560 --> 1:21:46.720]  disqualify mtg and other members of commerce from rerunning and just trying
[1:21:46.720 --> 1:21:50.240]  to destroy everybody so I think the listeners get that you though have been
[1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:52.800]  particularly successful I'm not gonna lot all the stuff you've done it would
[1:21:52.800 --> 1:21:57.120]  take two hours but give us you do a really good bull down the current state
[1:21:57.120 --> 1:22:00.920]  of the biomedical takeover why they backed off the covet attack for a while
[1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:04.440]  because I think people exposing them and what you think they're planning next and
[1:22:04.440 --> 1:22:08.280]  just kind of give us an update on that well so you know basically we were
[1:22:08.280 --> 1:22:11.760]  kicking their butts in the PR and the media everywhere we're hitting the courts
[1:22:11.760 --> 1:22:17.040]  we're hitting all this stuff right and what was going on is you know the the
[1:22:17.040 --> 1:22:22.040]  PR was so bad on this if people were waking up right and left so they needed
[1:22:22.040 --> 1:22:26.400]  the distraction so we started war with Ukraine right well the war with Ukraine
[1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:30.480]  did a bunch of things so first of all we got the hunter biden connections and
[1:22:30.480 --> 1:22:34.680]  we've got the globalist connection so in the Ukraine you've got first of all you
[1:22:34.680 --> 1:22:37.960]  got sources piggy bank all these guys run money through there it's a corrupt
[1:22:37.960 --> 1:22:43.320]  nation second of all you've got hunter biden who is funding these bio labs so
[1:22:43.320 --> 1:22:46.480]  and let me lay this out this isn't speculation alex this is oh it's on
[1:22:46.480 --> 1:22:51.640]  record oh yeah yeah right so we've got the evidence on this hunter biden who
[1:22:51.640 --> 1:22:55.920]  bought his firm bought a big stake in this company called meta biota meta biota
[1:22:55.920 --> 1:23:00.680]  was in Wuhan when they were creating SARS-CoV-2 in fact in 2015 we got the
[1:23:00.680 --> 1:23:04.880]  press release where they were very excited that they've created SARS-2 which
[1:23:04.880 --> 1:23:09.040]  sounds a little bit like SARS-CoV-2 but I'm sure it's totally different well you
[1:23:09.040 --> 1:23:14.440]  know listen so this same company the same meta biota also had ties with the
[1:23:14.440 --> 1:23:18.040]  Ukrainian bio labs you know that don't exist according to our corrupt
[1:23:18.040 --> 1:23:26.240]  administration well so meta biota is tied in all these groups well the the labs
[1:23:26.240 --> 1:23:35.680]  over in Ukraine also one of them got a grant in 2019 October of 2019 which is
[1:23:35.680 --> 1:23:41.160]  before COVID-19 existed if you believe the narrative to study COVID-19 now
[1:23:41.160 --> 1:23:44.840]  listen if they got a grant that means someone created the grant wrote the
[1:23:44.840 --> 1:23:50.960]  grant applied for the grant and received the grant October 2019 so COVID-19
[1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:56.760]  didn't exist so how did they do this before COVID-19 existed so we have you
[1:23:56.760 --> 1:24:01.360]  know hunter by exactly that goes back to what we know about what happened in in
[1:24:01.360 --> 1:24:05.760]  China they were preparing this years before they had patented as you said
[1:24:05.760 --> 1:24:12.520]  2016-17 they're caught red-handed oh no doubt no doubt and we've seen this over
[1:24:12.520 --> 1:24:15.880]  and over again they've been caught red-handed so you know we've got things
[1:24:15.880 --> 1:24:20.400]  reports are coming I don't know about this you know I know that I talked to
[1:24:20.400 --> 1:24:25.800]  some friends out of the UK some vets from the UK military some special forces
[1:24:25.800 --> 1:24:29.000]  had went over and they were gonna try and volunteer their services to help with
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:33.320]  this disaster in the Ukraine they said when they got to the border the
[1:24:33.320 --> 1:24:36.600]  Ukrainians turned them away said listen if you cross the border we're gonna tear
[1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:41.200]  up your passports there's no body armor that's confirmed now oh it that's been
[1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:44.760]  confirmed they basically take them as prisoners yeah oh I didn't see that so
[1:24:44.760 --> 1:24:47.520]  you know these guys were telling me firsthand that this is what they
[1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:52.080]  experienced sounds like they don't want people seeing what's happening over there
[1:24:52.080 --> 1:24:56.160]  I mean you you've seen I mean we've seen there we've seen the video of you know
[1:24:56.160 --> 1:25:00.480]  people in body bags getting up before the film oh yeah and the cardboard cutout
[1:25:00.480 --> 1:25:04.680]  guns and snake Island didn't happen and all of it oh I mean so you know listen I
[1:25:04.680 --> 1:25:07.320]  don't have confirmation I don't really know what's going on over there but what
[1:25:07.320 --> 1:25:11.720]  I do know is that it's a corrupt piggy bank for the globalists it's got there's
[1:25:11.720 --> 1:25:16.640]  ties with Hunter Biden all over the place there's reports that Russia was
[1:25:16.640 --> 1:25:21.520]  hitting these bio labs and there's the globalists haven't a fit over this
[1:25:21.520 --> 1:25:26.120]  because it's supposedly or potentially slowing down their plans these are
[1:25:26.120 --> 1:25:30.120]  things that really seem to fit the narrative and we've got so much evidence
[1:25:30.120 --> 1:25:35.120]  tying this all together that it's it's kind of hard to ignore I mean there at
[1:25:35.120 --> 1:25:40.200]  minimum we ought to be having legitimate investigations into what's going on but
[1:25:40.200 --> 1:25:45.000]  we can't even get an investigation that's real as to the origin of COVID-19
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:48.640]  well I kept asking how are they gonna cover up the vaccine damage how are they
[1:25:48.640 --> 1:25:54.680]  gonna cover up the lab origin which is proven and I said a war financial
[1:25:54.680 --> 1:26:01.680]  collapse and then now we're here yeah well and you I gotta tell you the last
[1:26:01.680 --> 1:26:07.120]  three years have been a red pill for me Alex I just the number of times I did I
[1:26:07.120 --> 1:26:12.120]  didn't see the Alex was the right t-shirt thing until today I need three of
[1:26:12.120 --> 1:26:16.680]  them I didn't have any idea and you know I listen I'm not blowing sunshine you
[1:26:16.680 --> 1:26:21.080]  just you were you were just correct and you know but here's the thing but I
[1:26:21.080 --> 1:26:24.480]  just so you know I'm not that smart that they basically telegraph what they're
[1:26:24.480 --> 1:26:27.880]  gonna do they do and that's my job is get everybody else who's smart but not
[1:26:27.880 --> 1:26:31.000]  thinking like a psycho to go hey you might want to read what claus Schwab says
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:35.800]  because they're doing it well here's the thing right so listen as a guy who a
[1:26:35.800 --> 1:26:38.200]  couple years ago thought this was all nonsense
[1:26:38.200 --> 1:26:43.120]  oh it's conspiracy theory right well but here's the thing when I look at you
[1:26:43.120 --> 1:26:48.720]  Val Noah Harari who's an advisor for Schwab who keeps getting invited back to
[1:26:48.720 --> 1:26:53.520]  the New York Times who gets you know welcomed to all these universities who
[1:26:53.520 --> 1:26:58.600]  sits down with Angela red carpet treatment what cron all of these people
[1:26:58.600 --> 1:27:02.280]  you have no free will humans are bad we're gonna get rid of you Jesus Christ
[1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:07.600]  is fake news there is no God you except I'm gonna be God he says oh yeah we're
[1:27:07.600 --> 1:27:13.360]  God I guess who's gonna be in charge now it's interesting he says he's these
[1:27:13.360 --> 1:27:17.160]  guys are saying things like I'm gonna hack human beings I'm gonna take your
[1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:22.520]  free will if you take my free will what you're doing is enslaving me right so
[1:27:22.520 --> 1:27:26.640]  this guy is a pro-slave guy he makes statements on a regular base so the high
[1:27:26.640 --> 1:27:32.000]  priest of Davos group is literally like Satan he well I mean he says I'm taking
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  your free will you're gonna die I rule you I mean we're like supposed to go oh
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:41.480]  yes sir Alex I'm you know I'm uncomfortable even saying it but he's
[1:27:41.480 --> 1:27:45.440]  saying it that's a thing it's great I agree you feel crazy saying what they
[1:27:45.440 --> 1:27:50.080]  said but they're saying it I listen I'm an attorney I've got a transcript in the
[1:27:50.080 --> 1:27:53.720]  form of a book or videos of this guy saying it I what am I supposed to
[1:27:53.720 --> 1:27:57.800]  deny that he puts it in his books oh it's everywhere I can't deny that he's
[1:27:57.800 --> 1:28:02.280]  saying it he is saying we want to say he's not some crazy guy on the side of
[1:28:02.280 --> 1:28:06.560]  the street he's literally the high priest of the Davos group being worshipped by
[1:28:06.560 --> 1:28:11.680]  the media Obama talking about how great this guy is all of these people are
[1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:15.840]  talking about how great this guy is and what he's saying is so ridiculous that
[1:28:15.840 --> 1:28:19.120]  it makes me uncomfortable to talk about because I like to think that I'm
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:23.000]  credible but he said perfectly in fact I want to take the clip of him the last
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:28.240]  two minutes and put that on the front of this interview we'll put out later at
[1:28:28.240 --> 1:28:31.040]  Bandai video we're obviously live right now but Thomas Wren's just knocked out
[1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:35.560]  of the park I mean you like you feel dirty saying what they said but it's
[1:28:35.560 --> 1:28:40.280]  real and in the media goes it's not real no one wants world government no one
[1:28:40.280 --> 1:28:44.200]  wants your free will and then they like they will bring him forward your will
[1:28:44.200 --> 1:28:50.000]  is gone we put chip in you tell them Noah yes we going to get rid of all of you
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:54.720]  it's wonderful I kill you all and you're like what I mean you know we'll be right

[1:33:43.600 --> 1:33:48.600]  all over the country with lawsuits and actions against the COVID tyranny you
[1:33:48.600 --> 1:33:55.800]  wanted to get into your substack Renz-law.com R-E-N-Z-law.com but get
[1:33:55.800 --> 1:33:59.160]  into what's happening currently with the COVID takeover and then all these other
[1:33:59.160 --> 1:34:03.640]  facets we're getting into Harari the high priest of the Davos group and his
[1:34:03.640 --> 1:34:07.680]  declaration of war against free will I mean this is just biblical stuff oh it
[1:34:07.680 --> 1:34:11.360]  is it is well and you know it's interesting because again it's
[1:34:11.360 --> 1:34:14.920]  uncomfortable to talk about but they're making it biblical when you start
[1:34:14.920 --> 1:34:21.160]  making references to to things that are you know the seemingly antichrist I mean
[1:34:21.160 --> 1:34:25.120]  there's talking about you know you can't participate in commerce without a you
[1:34:25.120 --> 1:34:30.160]  know mark a tracking mechanism there will be a chip under the skin and you
[1:34:30.160 --> 1:34:34.120]  do not do what we want you to die yeah and they're saying it I'm not saying it
[1:34:34.120 --> 1:34:39.080]  I think it's insane I think the whole thing is ridiculous it's absurd but
[1:34:39.080 --> 1:34:43.360]  here's how they're doing it well they are and what can I do should I deny it I
[1:34:43.360 --> 1:34:47.200]  mean this would be like me going into court over a murder case and saying you
[1:34:47.200 --> 1:34:50.960]  know it's ridiculous that this guy used a chainsaw to cut someone up so I can't
[1:34:50.960 --> 1:34:54.080]  I'm just not gonna bring that in because I don't like it it's exactly like why do
[1:34:54.080 --> 1:34:57.720]  you wear a clown mask and rape the kids I mean he did it these people are nuts
[1:34:57.720 --> 1:35:00.840]  yeah you're not supposed to say it because it sounds crazy it does sound
[1:35:00.840 --> 1:35:04.640]  crazy but they're saying it and apparently you know they've got the
[1:35:04.640 --> 1:35:08.160]  power to do it these are global leaders when they say that I asked that
[1:35:08.160 --> 1:35:12.600]  question I mean rep why do you think they're saying it openly then having
[1:35:12.600 --> 1:35:16.080]  corporate media say it is it true is that gaslighting or what is that you know
[1:35:16.080 --> 1:35:20.640]  I think everything about this is scripted planned and coordinated you know it
[1:35:20.640 --> 1:35:25.160]  when you when you you look at like serial killers okay cuz I mean listen if
[1:35:25.160 --> 1:35:28.720]  you're telling me you want to enslave the globe mm-hmm and you're telling me
[1:35:28.720 --> 1:35:33.240]  that and he said he said he said the rights all serial killer psychology how
[1:35:33.240 --> 1:35:38.280]  they planned it all out Nazis didn't have enough power KGB didn't have that's
[1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:41.960]  what the Harare's out there saying this he's saying the gerbils understood this
[1:35:41.960 --> 1:35:47.120]  so this guy's like he's a Jew and a Nazi sympathizer which is bizarre you've got
[1:35:47.120 --> 1:35:52.360]  a guy who's got some serious serious issues I don't know why you know listen
[1:35:52.360 --> 1:35:56.440]  serial killers like to put out announcements about how many people they
[1:35:56.440 --> 1:36:00.760]  kill and they like to brag about it I don't know why say these psychopaths
[1:36:00.760 --> 1:36:05.080]  any presence he once got up on C-span and said I did not kill 30% of the
[1:36:05.080 --> 1:36:10.760]  population of it was pulled pot in the camera as you come out he goes but I had
[1:36:10.760 --> 1:36:18.920]  him do it and they clapped all you kill all you kill all they get off on it sorry
[1:36:18.920 --> 1:36:22.640]  I'm interrupted no but you're right you're right so I don't you know why do
[1:36:22.640 --> 1:36:27.080]  they want to brag about it I don't know but what I do know is it's so ridiculous
[1:36:27.080 --> 1:36:31.840]  that what they're saying that when I repeat what they say yeah the mainstream
[1:36:31.840 --> 1:36:35.880]  is gonna say this sounds crazy who'd believe this well I agree with you who
[1:36:35.880 --> 1:36:40.200]  would believe it but why are they saying it then ask them not me your free will
[1:36:40.200 --> 1:36:47.400]  is over oh my god humans are over yeah it's it's insanity it is insanity but
[1:36:47.400 --> 1:36:52.040]  the thing about it is when you've got that kind of insanity and you've got
[1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:57.280]  them speaking to and working with and world leaders saying that they admire
[1:36:57.280 --> 1:37:02.960]  or you know appreciate what they're saying that's terrifying you know this
[1:37:02.960 --> 1:37:08.760]  Ferrari guy has met in person with Merkel she he is met in person with the
[1:37:08.760 --> 1:37:12.960]  president of France Macron I mean he is Obama said he's you know he's an
[1:37:12.960 --> 1:37:19.360]  amazing author these are these are can you imagine Alex can you imagine if you
[1:37:19.360 --> 1:37:24.200]  had a known Nazi sympathizer come on this show what you deal with can you
[1:37:24.200 --> 1:37:29.440]  imagine if president Donald Trump invited a nose Nazi sympathizer to come
[1:37:29.440 --> 1:37:33.440]  back over and over again and speak can you imagine if he associated or you
[1:37:33.440 --> 1:37:38.760]  associated with a guy who said it's just too bad the KGB and the Nazis didn't
[1:37:38.760 --> 1:37:43.120]  have this kind of power I mean the world for those that don't know he wants
[1:37:43.120 --> 1:37:47.160]  authoritarianism I showed articles earlier Bloomberg Washington Post saying we
[1:37:47.160 --> 1:37:51.240]  need dictators I mean they're not even hiding it anymore no and what they're
[1:37:51.240 --> 1:37:55.120]  saying here's what's important right so you got to understand it's sick and
[1:37:55.120 --> 1:37:58.960]  there's hypocrisy when we talk about the fact that you know these guys are
[1:37:58.960 --> 1:38:03.520]  associating with a no Nazi sympathizer and nobody's New York Times invites them
[1:38:03.520 --> 1:38:10.320]  back but here's the thing why does this matter to you and I okay it matters
[1:38:10.320 --> 1:38:13.920]  because these are the same guys who when they're talking about hacking humans and
[1:38:13.920 --> 1:38:19.360]  all this other ridiculous nonsense they're talking about digital currency
[1:38:19.360 --> 1:38:23.680]  now I don't know about the technology to hack a human I don't know you know I
[1:38:23.680 --> 1:38:27.280]  just don't have anything on that I can only take them at their word but
[1:38:27.280 --> 1:38:31.480]  digital currency I do know about it's feasible all they have to do is
[1:38:31.480 --> 1:38:35.680]  implement it but why would you implement digital currency it's only for control
[1:38:35.680 --> 1:38:39.480]  it's for they admit programmable tokens to decide what you even spend it on
[1:38:39.480 --> 1:38:44.080]  they will control not to surveil but control what your money can buy right
[1:38:44.080 --> 1:38:50.120]  and if guess what why do you trust someone who says that they want to hack
[1:38:50.120 --> 1:38:53.840]  human beings why isn't it crazy that we got warned two thousand years ago in the
[1:38:53.840 --> 1:38:58.680]  Bible like exactly this would happen and now it's happened well it's almost like
[1:38:58.680 --> 1:39:03.560]  they're following the all the bad parts of revelations to try and make they're
[1:39:03.560 --> 1:39:08.120]  using it as an owner's manual it's insanity I mean who's who wants to
[1:39:08.120 --> 1:39:11.520]  by the way you can watch hours of Harari and Schwab Schwab says all the same
[1:39:11.520 --> 1:39:16.000]  stuff you'll know free will put chip and you'll kill most it's good you have
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:20.880]  nothing you like it I mean it's like what I'm gonna I mean it's ridiculous
[1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:27.320]  Alex I gotta tell you is an attorney as someone who's tried very hard to remain
[1:39:27.320 --> 1:39:34.080]  very credible on the COVID I I just I really thought long and hard I want to
[1:39:34.080 --> 1:39:39.280]  talk about this publicly because it sounds insane it just every time I say
[1:39:39.280 --> 1:39:42.360]  it I feel like man if I lost but even Dr. Malone everybody else is coming out
[1:39:42.360 --> 1:39:46.240]  because it's true he goes and others speak to huge ballrooms and when they
[1:39:46.240 --> 1:39:49.760]  talk about we need to have sex with children they all wiggle around and
[1:39:49.760 --> 1:39:53.640]  giggle we're going to kill everyone it's like it's the it's a form of
[1:39:53.640 --> 1:39:57.840]  degeneracy so like just they they're getting off on this playing God they
[1:39:57.840 --> 1:40:03.520]  are and you know the thing about it is is so why does the COVID guy look at
[1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:07.640]  this right why is this a rems just that guy looking at COVID yeah I am so guess
[1:40:07.640 --> 1:40:13.400]  what here's what I found when I looked at COVID antifouch is a crook right but
[1:40:13.400 --> 1:40:17.360]  so are all of these presidents and other people all over the world how do you know
[1:40:17.360 --> 1:40:22.240]  if you're a crook you're doing this for a reason make money power whatever who
[1:40:22.240 --> 1:40:28.560]  has the ability to pay off buy off give power give whatever it is that Anthony
[1:40:28.560 --> 1:40:33.840]  Fauci that Macron that Merkel that all of these global scumbags are doing who
[1:40:33.840 --> 1:40:38.480]  has the kind of power and money necessary to make this happen and you got
[1:40:38.480 --> 1:40:43.000]  understand so if I put Anthony Fauci in jail tomorrow I feel great about that
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:46.600]  but they're gonna put a new scumbag in and they're gonna buy him off right
[1:40:46.600 --> 1:40:50.600]  exactly it's like shark teeth there's just endless there's endless so what I
[1:40:50.600 --> 1:40:56.640]  got to do is I got to ask myself okay someone somehow bought these people off
[1:40:56.640 --> 1:41:01.760]  to put this global death jab out there who did it how did I get to the head of
[1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:05.440]  the snake and when I start looking at the head of the snake what I find is
[1:41:05.440 --> 1:41:10.440]  this and this is an evidence thing and again I can't you can't just arrest the
[1:41:10.440 --> 1:41:14.640]  low-level soldiers you got to go after the kingpin absolutely you got to cut
[1:41:14.640 --> 1:41:18.800]  out the head the head of the snakes got to be gone so you know when I start
[1:41:18.800 --> 1:41:23.880]  looking here's what I find you know I hear because I work with all of the
[1:41:23.880 --> 1:41:28.680]  freedom fighters all over the country you know Mike Flynn and Clay Clark and
[1:41:28.680 --> 1:41:33.040]  you know everyone so you know I'm talking to these guys and you know they're
[1:41:33.040 --> 1:41:36.160]  telling me well we see this in the election we see this in January 6th
[1:41:36.160 --> 1:41:40.240]  hey you know this stuff with these pedophiles pushing this nonsense in
[1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:46.560]  schools this sick nonsense on young young children when I follow it would start
[1:41:46.560 --> 1:41:50.920]  looking at who's behind COVID who's who's pulling the strings for the Anthony
[1:41:50.920 --> 1:41:56.920]  Fauci's it's the same people it's it's it's Bill Gates it's the Rockefeller
[1:41:56.920 --> 1:42:01.320]  Foundation it's it's the exact same people it's always the same people and
[1:42:01.320 --> 1:42:06.760]  so I had this epiphany not this long ago and you know a friend of mine had given
[1:42:06.760 --> 1:42:10.240]  me some information and some new information I got whistleblowers all
[1:42:10.240 --> 1:42:13.160]  over the place give me all sorts of data and if I could make we should add you
[1:42:13.160 --> 1:42:15.480]  brought a lot of cases of big whistleblowers that have devastated them oh
[1:42:15.480 --> 1:42:20.600]  yeah yeah we've got massive amounts of whistleblower data I mean I I've made
[1:42:20.600 --> 1:42:25.240]  maybe just but your point is we can't just fight heads of the hider we got to
[1:42:25.240 --> 1:42:28.800]  fight the heart of the hydro we got to get to the heart and the thing about this
[1:42:28.800 --> 1:42:36.080]  is is the hat the heart is not Anthony Fauci the the heart is beyond that so you
[1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:41.000]  start looking in these globalists and you know it's hard to tell where one ends
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:44.920]  and the other begins is China part of it or are they against it well kind of both
[1:42:44.920 --> 1:42:48.000]  from what I'm seeing it's all an agenda they're building but they compete with
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:51.440]  each other over who gets the power yeah they're all building the takeover and
[1:42:51.440 --> 1:42:54.600]  then fighting over who gets the control we'll be right back stay with us Thomas
[1:42:54.600 --> 1:42:56.760]  Renz
[1:42:57.920 --> 1:43:02.920]  ladies and gentlemen I need your help I need your help keeping info wars on the
[1:43:02.920 --> 1:43:08.480]  air and strong I need your help making sure that our mission continues on I was
[1:43:08.480 --> 1:43:12.760]  born for this you were born for this and people are really waking up right now
[1:43:12.760 --> 1:43:16.320]  but we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship
[1:43:16.320 --> 1:43:20.720]  and de-platforming that cost tens of millions of dollars and now with band
[1:43:20.720 --> 1:43:25.160]  dot video getting close to 10 million views a day we're a platform for thousands
[1:43:25.160 --> 1:43:30.240]  of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of
[1:43:30.240 --> 1:43:36.600]  charge and because it's become so successful it's a catch 22 info wars and
[1:43:36.600 --> 1:43:40.840]  band dot video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human Liberty movement
[1:43:40.840 --> 1:43:46.040]  worldwide but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter
[1:43:46.040 --> 1:43:50.000]  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month so the biggest sale in
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:54.280]  info wars history is going right now the mega emergency blowout sale up to 75%
[1:43:54.280 --> 1:43:59.200]  off getting credible products and keep info wars as strong as ever there is
[1:43:59.200 --> 1:44:05.880]  very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class not
[1:44:05.880 --> 1:44:11.720]  in communist China not in Mexico not in the United States not anywhere is there
[1:44:11.720 --> 1:44:17.160]  a real study of the planet's ruling class and that's done by design the large
[1:44:17.160 --> 1:44:21.280]  central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any
[1:44:21.280 --> 1:44:26.400]  academics that look into say the Anglo-American establishment the sound
[1:44:26.400 --> 1:44:29.640]  of the Bilderberg group the Trilateral Commission the United Nations the whole
[1:44:29.640 --> 1:44:33.720]  project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellas until 10 years ago the
[1:44:33.720 --> 1:44:38.640]  media said the control corporate media the Bilderberg group didn't exist well
[1:44:38.640 --> 1:44:42.480]  now the Bilderberg group is public in its former head still in the steering
[1:44:42.480 --> 1:44:46.600]  committee is called Schwab and he has set up the great reset in global
[1:44:46.600 --> 1:44:50.600]  government and give as a Liberty movement worldwide we don't address the
[1:44:50.600 --> 1:44:54.680]  globalist head-on about the second-tier worldwide authoritarian corporate
[1:44:54.680 --> 1:44:58.440]  takeover we don't have a shot we do expose them we can beat a measly our
[1:44:58.440 --> 1:45:04.160]  world is so full of hype your force-fed dehumanizing propaganda by the
[1:45:04.160 --> 1:45:08.680]  corporate media by the controlled churches and universities why is this
[1:45:08.680 --> 1:45:14.240]  the case because we innately by God have been given the keys for our own minds
[1:45:14.240 --> 1:45:18.760]  our own side he's our own souls and by connecting to God we can empower ourselves
[1:45:18.760 --> 1:45:25.400]  and trend sin the quote fallen or sinful state so the chemicals that we ingest
[1:45:25.400 --> 1:45:31.240]  and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to change who we are are only
[1:45:31.240 --> 1:45:34.520]  lowering us they're only making us more present in the end they're only making
[1:45:34.520 --> 1:45:39.000]  us less filled it is only by going within and really making that connection
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:42.560]  to God that we can truly empower ourselves that's why the globalist
[1:45:42.560 --> 1:45:46.920]  bombard us with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins and
[1:45:46.920 --> 1:45:51.440]  minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to

[1:47:07.680 --> 1:47:23.280]  Thomas Renz is a lawyer who's been battling the whole cupboard tyranny at
[1:47:23.280 --> 1:47:26.680]  point-blank range having big victories Renz-law.com you find them on
[1:47:26.680 --> 1:47:31.600]  substack as well amazing work but you're absolutely right identifying this is a
[1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:35.080]  larger globalist agenda not just fighting one head of the Idris key please
[1:47:35.080 --> 1:47:40.080]  continue well and that's really the key and what I've found is you know when we
[1:47:40.080 --> 1:47:42.760]  start looking at that then we start seeing connections and I'll give you a
[1:47:42.760 --> 1:47:51.320]  couple great examples so let's take let's take Amazon right Jeff Bezos owns
[1:47:51.320 --> 1:47:56.000]  Amazon he also owns the Washington Post when the COVID lockdowns occur
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:59.960]  Amazon starts making insane amounts of money because first of all they're
[1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:03.280]  eliminating competition the small businesses mid-sized businesses were
[1:48:03.280 --> 1:48:07.040]  all shut down and most of them went out of business so it was a huge win for
[1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:10.840]  them meanwhile sales for online deliveries a skyrocket well small
[1:48:10.840 --> 1:48:14.000]  businesses don't have an online delivery system like Amazon so that you know
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:18.600]  they lost Amazon wins big now do you think that Jeff Bezos is gonna allow the
[1:48:18.600 --> 1:48:23.120]  press the Washington Post that he owns to publish anything bad about about the
[1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:27.480]  lockdowns or about the vaccines or anything else no he's not so this is
[1:48:27.480 --> 1:48:32.120]  beyond insider trading oh it's way beyond and this is fundamental and this is
[1:48:32.120 --> 1:48:36.320]  where we see companies like BlackRock and Vanguard so Alex you were telling me
[1:48:36.320 --> 1:48:39.840]  during the break this is but this is this is this is amazing yeah so so I
[1:48:39.840 --> 1:48:42.880]  don't know there's a lot of talk about the food shortage and supply change
[1:48:42.880 --> 1:48:47.480]  shortage well it's all manufactured so Union Pacific the railroad company that's
[1:48:47.480 --> 1:48:51.160]  responsible for most of the fertilizer shipments and you know most of the
[1:48:51.160 --> 1:48:54.880]  important farmland in the country has just decided that they're going to cut
[1:48:54.880 --> 1:48:59.600]  way back on shipments of fertilizer this year in the spring during
[1:48:59.600 --> 1:49:04.560]  now wait a second they don't have to do this in the Biden administration who's
[1:49:04.560 --> 1:49:08.080]  telling us there might be food shortages if they cared would certainly do
[1:49:08.080 --> 1:49:12.280]  something about it but guess what nobody's saying a word and this is this
[1:49:12.280 --> 1:49:16.200]  is the destruction of the country the cutting off the pipelines everything and
[1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:19.960]  then Cutlow goes why is Biden so dumb he's not done they're following an
[1:49:19.960 --> 1:49:23.800]  agenda to collapse the country yeah well and Biden's pooping his pants in a
[1:49:23.800 --> 1:49:26.840]  corner somewhere he doesn't even know what he's doing but his administration
[1:49:26.840 --> 1:49:31.360]  the people around him are all crooks and so here's what's happening though Union
[1:49:31.360 --> 1:49:34.760]  Pacific Railroad that for no apparent reason decided that they're not going
[1:49:34.760 --> 1:49:39.560]  to ship fertilizer well who are they owned by well they're two biggest
[1:49:39.560 --> 1:49:44.000]  stakeholders are Blackrock and Vanguard Blackrock and Vanguard are the two
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:50.800]  biggest holders or financial managers in the world they're they're huge they
[1:49:50.800 --> 1:49:54.280]  control everything so we don't have powerful financial institutions trying
[1:49:54.280 --> 1:49:58.320]  to empower people they're at war with us please continue oh they are but here's
[1:49:58.320 --> 1:50:01.920]  how it works and here's why this is important and here's how this ties in
[1:50:01.920 --> 1:50:06.240]  with COVID and everything else what we have is we have a series of what you
[1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:11.800]  would call vertical monopolies you have companies that own entire chains from
[1:50:11.800 --> 1:50:15.680]  from the creation of product to the sales of the product to the getting the
[1:50:15.680 --> 1:50:19.360]  resources they own everything and what they do is they own a whole bunch of
[1:50:19.360 --> 1:50:24.800]  different industries as well and they use their positions in one industry to
[1:50:24.800 --> 1:50:29.680]  help them profit in another so so Blackrock for example owns assets in
[1:50:29.680 --> 1:50:34.240]  everything everything and you know there's some estimates they'll have like
[1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:39.200]  98% of everything within a decade oh it's I mean this is economic warfare it
[1:50:39.200 --> 1:50:43.040]  absolutely is it's the consolidation of power and money into the hands of a few
[1:50:43.040 --> 1:50:47.560]  it's it's the greatest wealth transfer in world history and what they're doing is
[1:50:47.560 --> 1:50:53.680]  they're using various industries to create this kind of war on freedom so you
[1:50:53.680 --> 1:50:58.520]  know the vaccines and Pfizer and you know this whole COVID thing is a massive
[1:50:58.520 --> 1:51:02.160]  thing Schwab told us it's part of this great reset it's a great opportunity
[1:51:02.160 --> 1:51:06.640]  meanwhile you've got groups like Blackrock and Vanguard that are leveraging
[1:51:06.640 --> 1:51:09.680]  their position in one industry to create issues and other creating
[1:51:09.680 --> 1:51:14.080]  emergencies guess what they made tons of money off of the vaccine the COVID
[1:51:14.080 --> 1:51:17.640]  crisis they're gonna make tons of money off of a food crisis that they're
[1:51:17.640 --> 1:51:21.680]  manufacturing they're gonna make tons of money off of an energy crisis anything
[1:51:21.680 --> 1:51:24.880]  that they can manufacture that's a crisis they're gonna make more money on
[1:51:24.880 --> 1:51:28.320]  they're gonna consolidate and the money is just to consolidate and then it's
[1:51:28.320 --> 1:51:35.040]  social engineer it is absolutely and this is why this is so important COVID is
[1:51:35.040 --> 1:51:40.480]  COVID led me here but when I realized if I want to go after the heart of the
[1:51:40.480 --> 1:51:45.440]  Hydra rather than just chopping off heads it's not just Anthony Fauci now I
[1:51:45.440 --> 1:51:49.680]  got to get him in jail that's that's just a personal goal as to see him in
[1:51:49.680 --> 1:51:57.200]  orange at some point but in any event that's not the end of it and we have to
[1:51:57.200 --> 1:52:00.440]  be smart enough to look beyond this we can't just stop at the end of our nose
[1:52:00.440 --> 1:52:06.000]  we got to see the real bad guys not that Anthony Fauci is not a real bad guy
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:09.200]  he's an absolute model he's still there's a little thug they control he's
[1:52:09.200 --> 1:52:15.120]  mid-level management at best right and that's amazing can you imagine how big
[1:52:15.120 --> 1:52:21.800]  this must be to say someone like Anthony Fauci's mid-level he is so he is just a
[1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:25.920]  cog in the wheel and we've got this because you look at he's on the board
[1:52:25.920 --> 1:52:29.920]  for the Gates Foundation he doesn't control the Gates Foundation or was on
[1:52:29.920 --> 1:52:34.800]  the board you know he's he is a you know he's doing what he's told to do by his
[1:52:34.800 --> 1:52:39.920]  puppet masters now is the Gates Foundation in charge now no it's bigger
[1:52:39.920 --> 1:52:45.360]  than even them oh it was the Rockefeller Foundation set it up with his dad it's all
[1:52:45.360 --> 1:52:51.160]  them it's been this has been in plan and you can follow the law and the
[1:52:51.160 --> 1:52:55.520]  evolution of the law and how it's been implemented and you can follow this
[1:52:55.520 --> 1:52:59.000]  evidence and oh that has been hiding now the Rockefeller Foundation is in
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:03.920]  charge of the US and UN World Response to COVID I mean they are in charge of it
[1:53:03.920 --> 1:53:07.160]  all and the head of the Carnegie group is even more powerful he's out of the CIA
[1:53:07.160 --> 1:53:10.840]  well and listen you know here's the thing you want to tell me I'm a
[1:53:10.840 --> 1:53:14.120]  conspiracy theorist you want to tell me this is wrong I'm gonna tell you right
[1:53:14.120 --> 1:53:18.800]  now on camera how the government Biden can get rid of me and every bit of
[1:53:18.800 --> 1:53:22.960]  disinformation that he says I'm putting out there and I'm gonna tell you how do
[1:53:22.960 --> 1:53:28.280]  two things eliminate immunity for vaccine manufacturers because if it's safe and
[1:53:28.280 --> 1:53:33.200]  effective how do they need immunity so eliminate that and then make the raw
[1:53:33.200 --> 1:53:38.320]  data that you've got from the 40 different collection groups and databases
[1:53:38.320 --> 1:53:41.780]  that you're using to determine safety and efficacy of the vaccines make it
[1:53:41.780 --> 1:53:46.960]  available I'll raise the money myself to fund an independent auditor to go
[1:53:46.960 --> 1:53:51.640]  through that raw data and if you you can discredit me tomorrow and then you can
[1:53:51.640 --> 1:53:55.120]  say everybody in this country should get these safe and effective vaccines
[1:53:55.120 --> 1:53:58.000]  because if they're not safe and effective you can sue the manufacturer
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:02.480]  plus we've shown that Renz is a crazy guy because we put the raw date out you
[1:54:02.480 --> 1:54:06.440]  don't have to hide it if you're telling the truth but you see they keep what they
[1:54:06.440 --> 1:54:13.080]  do is they call guys like us crazy conspiracy theorists but they say that
[1:54:13.080 --> 1:54:18.080]  but won't share the information these guys are liars they're crooks they're
[1:54:18.080 --> 1:54:21.760]  misleading they're illusionist it is nonsense from beginning and their
[1:54:21.760 --> 1:54:25.800]  excuse to be criminals and psychos is extinction rebellion there's too many
[1:54:25.800 --> 1:54:28.840]  people so they can do horrible things because they're ridding the earth of
[1:54:28.840 --> 1:54:33.760]  bad people but it's really just their crooked cosmology and ideology like
[1:54:33.760 --> 1:54:39.480]  ISIS to do over the hell they want Alex I didn't coin the phrase useless eaters
[1:54:39.480 --> 1:54:45.480]  I mean useless eaters that's a Hitler Joseph Gerber well yeah it's been around
[1:54:45.480 --> 1:54:48.920]  for a long time but it's one that's been adopted by this world economic on they
[1:54:48.920 --> 1:54:52.360]  say it they say we want to get rid of you and then they're like open with this
[1:54:52.360 --> 1:54:56.040]  shot so you don't die but you want me to die but you want me to take a shot to

[1:55:07.520 --> 1:55:12.680]  over so let me remind us all of one of the most terrible things that we dealt
[1:55:12.680 --> 1:55:19.800]  with in American history slavery slavery we had a civil war over it remember
[1:55:19.800 --> 1:55:26.240]  Kissinger slavery go out and interrupt go ahead but what listen what is it if I
[1:55:26.240 --> 1:55:31.960]  subjugate your free will that's slavery it's the definition it is in Kissinger

[1:56:19.480 --> 1:56:24.640]  gonna fight because that's what we do listen these guys these guys have said
[1:56:24.640 --> 1:56:27.640]  what they want to do they've told us what they're gonna do they're told us why
[1:56:27.640 --> 1:56:31.440]  they're gonna do it they've told us that we're useless eaters that free wills a
[1:56:31.440 --> 1:56:35.480]  joke they've told us they're gonna take it they're gonna take control listen

[1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:47.760]  no I do have will and God gave it to me like air at my sails wind in my cells I
[1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:52.600]  do have will I have will I'm gonna use it I'm gonna break freedom down into three
[1:56:52.600 --> 1:56:58.400]  parts there is spiritual or freedom of conscience there is bodily autonomy the
[1:56:58.400 --> 1:57:02.040]  ability to move to be free to control what goes in and out of your body and
[1:57:02.040 --> 1:57:06.360]  there is freedom of speech to communicate your thoughts and your ideas and
[1:57:06.360 --> 1:57:09.440]  it's all under attack by these bastards most of that's covered in the in the
[1:57:09.440 --> 1:57:14.440]  bill of rights of the United States Constitution the other part of freedom is
[1:57:14.440 --> 1:57:19.440]  the second amendment now no one wants violence no one wants anything but
[1:57:19.440 --> 1:57:24.520]  peaceful resistance but our founding fathers knew that the ultimate check
[1:57:24.520 --> 1:57:30.040]  against unchecked power was the ability to defend yourself the first amendment
[1:57:30.040 --> 1:57:34.040]  and the rest of the bill of rights define freedom Thomas rinse you're on fire I
[1:57:34.040 --> 1:57:37.440]  love you in studio this we gotta go to break do five more minutes of David
[1:57:37.440 --> 1:57:40.480]  Fox coming up come back and start over what you're saying the three types of
[1:57:40.480 --> 1:57:43.440]  freedom because you're absolutely right and folks if you don't stand up for
[1:57:43.440 --> 1:57:47.920]  yourself you're dead if you do we win we'll be right back
[1:57:48.800 --> 1:57:53.280]  it's about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand in for worse I've been on the
[1:57:53.280 --> 1:57:57.200]  air a couple of years but I only had money to finance my own simple little
[1:57:57.200 --> 1:58:00.840]  local radio show I wanted to hire camera people I wanted to make films I wanted
[1:58:00.840 --> 1:58:04.880]  to really challenge the globalist and it was a t-shirt I designed the first one
[1:58:04.880 --> 1:58:10.240]  mass murderers agree gun control works that helped us finance hiring the first
[1:58:10.240 --> 1:58:14.320]  two members of my crew that's our oldest design and we still sell it we have
[1:58:14.320 --> 1:58:18.600]  that design over a hundred others that will now all be limited editions because
[1:58:18.600 --> 1:58:23.160]  whatever stock we've got in that's it we're selling everything out to fund the
[1:58:23.160 --> 1:58:26.800]  operation to get rid of inventory we'll still have some teachers in the future
[1:58:26.800 --> 1:58:30.400]  they'll just be limited editions and short runs so if you want to get any of

[1:59:58.080 --> 2:00:24.360]  I've always been impressed in the last couple years watching fight the
[2:00:24.360 --> 2:00:29.280]  tyrants great lawyer great success but in person you see you've really gone to
[2:00:29.280 --> 2:00:31.800]  the next level there and that's exciting and so many others are going to the
[2:00:31.800 --> 2:00:35.320]  next level and the tyrants need to know that yeah we were out of the game being
[2:00:35.320 --> 2:00:39.880]  normal folks raising families but no their plan and now we're we're we're
[2:00:39.880 --> 2:00:42.960]  getting caught up very quick I think that's why they're so scared so recap the
[2:00:42.960 --> 2:00:46.160]  three types of freedom what you were saying was amazing yeah I didn't want
[2:00:46.160 --> 2:00:49.720]  this fight but I have to take it the freedom breaks down into three things
[2:00:49.720 --> 2:00:54.040]  right so you've got spiritual freedom of consciousness freedom of thought you've
[2:00:54.040 --> 2:00:58.160]  got the freedom to communicate your thought freedom of speech and then you
[2:00:58.160 --> 2:01:02.560]  have the freedom of movement bodily autonomy you know what comes in goes
[2:01:02.560 --> 2:01:07.840]  out of your body controlling yourself now historically historically we've
[2:01:07.840 --> 2:01:11.360]  thought of freedom through you know this freedom of speech and and freedom to
[2:01:11.360 --> 2:01:17.320]  control your body now these lunatics are telling us that you know they can
[2:01:17.320 --> 2:01:21.360]  actually take that third piece that was always untouchable the freedom to think
[2:01:21.360 --> 2:01:25.680]  the freedom of conscience they actually think they can take that if they take
[2:01:25.680 --> 2:01:31.200]  any of those three freedom is gone if they take all of those three everything's
[2:01:31.200 --> 2:01:35.720]  gone there's no winning there's no coming back and that we have to fight to
[2:01:35.720 --> 2:01:39.600]  the bitter end which is why the Second Amendment's there if it ever came to
[2:01:39.600 --> 2:01:43.560]  that but we don't want it to come to that that's why I can't be ashamed of the
[2:01:43.560 --> 2:01:47.440]  fact it's there in desperate times and we don't want to institute that now but
[2:01:47.440 --> 2:01:52.280]  with what's happening everybody should just know God is gonna direct you at
[2:01:52.280 --> 2:01:56.720]  the time and place if you have to defend yourself well yeah and right now we're
[2:01:56.720 --> 2:01:59.560]  not there we don't need to worry about we're winning politically and
[2:01:59.560 --> 2:02:03.040]  spiritually that's why they're panicking well they're panicking you know and
[2:02:03.040 --> 2:02:07.200]  listen that's why you don't give up the Second Amendment right it's there it's
[2:02:07.200 --> 2:02:10.480]  carrying the big stick it's speaking softly but carrying the big stick you
[2:02:10.480 --> 2:02:16.520]  don't give it up but here's the thing we've lost our freedom the price of
[2:02:16.520 --> 2:02:21.040]  freedom's eternal vigilance we didn't pay that price my generation sat on our
[2:02:21.040 --> 2:02:27.360]  lazy butts and I include myself in this we watch as they pass bad law after bad
[2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:32.840]  law after bad law we watch we call guys like Alex crazy I didn't believe him
[2:02:32.840 --> 2:02:37.920]  either now I do he was right and you know what while he was out fighting I
[2:02:37.920 --> 2:02:42.020]  was sitting on my butt I was enjoying the freedoms that my parents and my
[2:02:42.020 --> 2:02:46.280]  grandparents fought for in the country that they built and I watched as it took
[2:02:46.280 --> 2:02:50.120]  it got taken away from me and it wasn't until COVID that I realized guess what
[2:02:50.120 --> 2:02:57.440]  it's gone so now I want to stress it's gone we've lost it this is about how
[2:02:57.440 --> 2:03:02.200]  much more we're gonna lose and how we're gonna get it back we've got to earn our
[2:03:02.200 --> 2:03:05.440]  country back earn it back I totally agree with you we have to admit we've been
[2:03:05.440 --> 2:03:09.160]  taken over we people need to get we're already in the dungeon we got to get out
[2:03:09.160 --> 2:03:14.480]  we have to fight our way back that comes through people waking up it comes
[2:03:14.480 --> 2:03:18.440]  listen we've got Jesus Christ Martin Luther King Mahatana Dundee we've got
[2:03:18.440 --> 2:03:21.680]  all sorts of people people who've taught we have the blueprints for
[2:03:21.680 --> 2:03:26.600]  revolutions we have to have it we have to fight for we have to say we will not
[2:03:26.600 --> 2:03:32.120]  be enslaved again we learned when we were so monstrous that we enslaved people
[2:03:32.120 --> 2:03:35.120]  based on skin color do you think that we're gonna allow that to happen again
[2:03:35.120 --> 2:03:40.280]  no hell no we aren't hell no we aren't we're gonna fight in the courts we're
[2:03:40.280 --> 2:03:43.480]  gonna fight it in the court of public opinion we're gonna fight now they've
[2:03:43.480 --> 2:03:48.760]  reversed it that whites are inherently bad oh yeah yeah well apparently and you
[2:03:48.760 --> 2:03:53.840]  know listen my kids one of my heroes growing up Martin Luther King Martin
[2:03:53.840 --> 2:03:59.200]  Luther King that man said and this is one of the single most the single thing
[2:03:59.200 --> 2:04:03.840]  that resonated most with me I dream of a day that a man will be judged by and
[2:04:03.840 --> 2:04:07.200]  I'm paraphrasing by the content of their character rather than the color of their
[2:04:07.200 --> 2:04:10.240]  skin I've had the privilege of traveling around the world before
[2:04:10.240 --> 2:04:15.320]  everybody got locked down with this insanity I've never been to a place
[2:04:15.320 --> 2:04:20.600]  where people don't bleed red never once ever once my kids didn't know that
[2:04:20.600 --> 2:04:24.600]  skin color was a thing until they got to school and someone taught him that
[2:04:24.600 --> 2:04:29.040]  exactly I had to explain to me it's not a thing I don't tell the vision it's

[2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:23.920]  for I think about 32 because he was instrumental in waking me up to the next
[2:06:23.920 --> 2:06:27.560]  level and now we talked about the emergence he talked about the point
[2:06:27.560 --> 2:06:31.320]  where it can't hide anymore it comes out in the open and I've got articles right
[2:06:31.320 --> 2:06:34.840]  here a whole stack of them Washington Post Bloomberg financial Times of
[2:06:34.840 --> 2:06:40.200]  London saying we need a dictatorship we need to end free speech I played clips
[2:06:40.200 --> 2:06:44.360]  of ABC news CNN you name it a compilation earlier saying do not
[2:06:44.360 --> 2:06:51.920]  question that's evil I mean you've got no horari of the of the Bilderberg group
[2:06:51.920 --> 2:06:56.440]  and Davos group saying Hitler was good and we will and your free will is gone
[2:06:56.440 --> 2:07:02.240]  I mean these people are out in the open they can't hide it anymore here's some
[2:07:02.240 --> 2:07:05.840]  of the headlines it's time to give the elites a bigger say in choosing the
[2:07:05.840 --> 2:07:12.320]  president Washington Post then we've got all these other articles democracy works
[2:07:12.320 --> 2:07:16.280]  better when there's less of it financial Times of London Bloomberg to save
[2:07:16.280 --> 2:07:21.640]  democracy we need a few good dictators oxymoronic so why are they making their
[2:07:21.640 --> 2:07:26.160]  move now why are they so desperate and right as they power grab Hollywood's
[2:07:26.160 --> 2:07:29.800]  collapsing Netflix is collapsing confidence of them is collapsing it is
[2:07:29.800 --> 2:07:35.120]  very paradoxical and what we know is they're not in charge they're not
[2:07:35.120 --> 2:07:38.800]  empowered right now doesn't mean we're winning but it doesn't mean they're
[2:07:38.800 --> 2:07:43.320]  winning they are desperate why are they desperate so the icon of icons is David
[2:07:43.320 --> 2:07:49.120]  Ike he is the trailblazer he's the guy that took it to the next level and I'm
[2:07:49.120 --> 2:07:53.320]  just really honored to have David Ike with us David Ike dot com iconic dot com
[2:07:53.320 --> 2:07:57.680]  banned out video forward slash channel David dash Ike we're honored to have him
[2:07:57.680 --> 2:08:01.400]  over at banned out video so David great to have you here for the hour really
[2:08:01.400 --> 2:08:05.280]  appreciate you and just where to start with what's happening in the world right
[2:08:05.280 --> 2:08:08.920]  now because obviously you taught us there'll be a moment of emergence I think
[2:08:08.920 --> 2:08:15.040]  that started two years ago what comes next after the emergence well why why
[2:08:15.040 --> 2:08:22.040]  are they putting themselves on public display now because they've got no choice
[2:08:22.040 --> 2:08:28.440]  you know I said a long time ago that this can only remain under the radar
[2:08:28.440 --> 2:08:34.800]  operating in the shadows for so long because if you are planning to transform
[2:08:34.800 --> 2:08:42.960]  human society the society that people can see and experience every day then at
[2:08:42.960 --> 2:08:51.000]  some point you've got to change that which people can see so obviously because
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:56.720]  you that's what you how you want to change that society that people and
[2:08:56.720 --> 2:09:02.480]  accept the absolutely solid gold please tell me it's not true still asleep and
[2:09:02.480 --> 2:09:11.160]  that people with a smear of or vision can see is happening so you can't hide it
[2:09:11.160 --> 2:09:17.560]  so what you do then is you move into sales pitch mode you can't hide it so
[2:09:17.560 --> 2:09:25.120]  you sell it and so what we're being told now is that connecting you your brain
[2:09:25.120 --> 2:09:31.440]  to AI is is something that will make us gods it will make us super human the
[2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:38.720]  idea is to make us post-human and all these things are being put forward a as
[2:09:38.720 --> 2:09:46.280]  a good thing and B because of the problems they're creating like the
[2:09:46.280 --> 2:09:51.480]  dismantling demolition of the economy and all these other things that are
[2:09:51.480 --> 2:09:56.640]  going on and the the hoaxes like your co vid and your human-caused climate change
[2:09:56.640 --> 2:10:03.400]  the other technique is to create those problems most of them illusory but not
[2:10:03.400 --> 2:10:07.700]  all tell people it's illusory the economy is being dismantled and then you
[2:10:07.700 --> 2:10:13.560]  offer the solutions to those problems so the we're in a situation now where
[2:10:13.560 --> 2:10:18.520]  they're selling it on one side they're saying it's a great thing what we what
[2:10:18.520 --> 2:10:22.440]  we want it's a new society as a new human and on the other side they're
[2:10:22.440 --> 2:10:27.920]  saying well we've got to do this because of what's happening in the world we've
[2:10:27.920 --> 2:10:31.400]  got to solve the problems of the world what they don't tell you is that they're
[2:10:31.400 --> 2:10:35.840]  creating them or at least the illusion of them so so it's out in the open now
[2:10:35.840 --> 2:10:49.080]  and so you then look at how can they survive a debate an open public debate
[2:10:49.080 --> 2:10:55.600]  on what they're doing and how can they survive the evidence being revealed of
[2:10:55.600 --> 2:11:01.660]  why they're doing it and what's behind it and what the whole game is well you
[2:11:01.660 --> 2:11:08.160]  survive by censoring that information so you've got the the sales pitch going and
[2:11:08.160 --> 2:11:17.160]  you've got the shutting down and the ever more extreme targeting of those
[2:11:17.160 --> 2:11:22.080]  people and the alternative media that are exposing actually that it's not a
[2:11:22.080 --> 2:11:25.560]  great idea and this is the real reason for it exactly what you're saying is
[2:11:25.560 --> 2:11:29.160]  David is they can only get away with it if they silence us so that the gas
[2:11:29.160 --> 2:11:32.720]  lighting is complete they can't have anybody pointing out the in person who
[2:11:32.720 --> 2:11:37.200]  closed that's why they're so desperate to silence you with dirty tricks desperate
[2:11:37.200 --> 2:11:41.320]  to shut us down with dirty tricks they are just hysterical right now well
[2:11:41.320 --> 2:11:48.760]  exactly because look if you know and they already know that in an open forum
[2:11:48.760 --> 2:11:54.360]  they can't win the debate they'll get demolished I keep asking people who you
[2:11:54.360 --> 2:12:01.280]  know how do they go at me okay so debate me live right bring as many people you
[2:12:01.280 --> 2:12:06.160]  want on your side I'll just represent me but they'll never take you up on it
[2:12:06.160 --> 2:12:13.720]  because they can't win the debate and thus they don't have it and so what
[2:12:13.720 --> 2:12:20.720]  we're looking at is what I was saying a long long time ago that the plan is to
[2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:26.760]  reach the point and all well talked about this as well when no one ever sees
[2:12:26.760 --> 2:12:32.720]  or hears anything that isn't approved by the government and that's the where
[2:12:32.720 --> 2:12:38.720]  we're heading and it we're heading there because just as they can't hide it
[2:12:38.720 --> 2:12:43.240]  anymore because the changes they want to make they're making in the world of the
[2:12:43.240 --> 2:12:50.280]  scene they can't survive the the exposure of what they're doing so there
[2:12:50.280 --> 2:13:00.440]  that they've got this twinned attack of selling a tyranny and making sure that
[2:13:00.440 --> 2:13:05.240]  people exposing the tyranny are not heard and so what you've seen it started
[2:13:05.240 --> 2:13:10.120]  off it's all stepping stones the totalitarian tiptoe it started off we
[2:13:10.120 --> 2:13:14.720]  with YouTube are demonetizing people in the alternative media you know they
[2:13:14.720 --> 2:13:20.920]  looked at the alternative media and they said okay what are the how do these
[2:13:20.920 --> 2:13:26.040]  people survive how do they do what they do full-time okay well one way is they
[2:13:26.040 --> 2:13:31.440]  get income from from YouTube videos right so we're gonna we're gonna get rid
[2:13:31.440 --> 2:13:34.760]  of that so that was number one and you knew where it was going from there and
[2:13:34.760 --> 2:13:42.240]  then of course the different criteria for censorship by YouTube has just got
[2:13:42.240 --> 2:13:47.880]  more and more hysterical I was off it in the spring of 2020 because of what I
[2:13:47.880 --> 2:13:55.120]  said about COVID and so it's got more and more extreme so now you're seeing
[2:13:55.120 --> 2:14:02.320]  professional doctors being censored and thrown off YouTube and social media
[2:14:02.320 --> 2:14:08.840]  for giving a professional medical opinion and the common theme of course is
[2:14:08.840 --> 2:14:16.040]  not who you are it's what you're saying and it doesn't matter what your
[2:14:16.040 --> 2:14:20.760]  background is it doesn't matter what your expertise is none of that matters
[2:14:20.760 --> 2:14:26.720]  it's what you are saying and that's the criteria on which people are obviously
[2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:34.520]  being censored and as this gets squeezed and squeezed and squeezed the ability
[2:14:34.520 --> 2:14:42.840]  on the mainstream internet to criticize even mildly expressions of this agenda
[2:14:42.840 --> 2:14:50.000]  and this narrative are being censored now what that tells you is actually an
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:54.520]  inversion of what it seems to be what it seems to be is these people are all
[2:14:54.520 --> 2:15:01.400]  powerful no they're not you don't censor if you're powerful I'm not trying to
[2:15:01.400 --> 2:15:05.080]  censor anybody I want the free flow of information if people want to have a go
[2:15:05.080 --> 2:15:14.240]  at me please feel free you know because we we lose this basic basic it's
[2:15:14.240 --> 2:15:19.480]  basic understanding of what free speech is it's the freedom to speak it's the
[2:15:19.480 --> 2:15:24.160]  freedom to express your opinion ah yes even those I don't agree with or he
[2:15:24.160 --> 2:15:27.320]  doesn't agree with us she doesn't agree with stay there very powerful let's come

[2:15:31.160 --> 2:15:34.680]  speech happen you're in a prison even the censors put themselves in a prison

[2:20:06.520 --> 2:20:20.920]  so there are a lot of great people that expose the globalist like buried
[2:20:20.920 --> 2:20:29.240]  goldwater and clion scousin and the john bird society long before I was born
[2:20:29.240 --> 2:20:34.520]  but the guy that really exposed the full depopulation agenda and really that
[2:20:34.520 --> 2:20:38.920]  was an anti-human really alien force was David Ike he's with us right now for
[2:20:38.920 --> 2:20:43.080]  the rest of the hour on this special Thursday April 21st transmission so you
[2:20:43.080 --> 2:20:47.560]  were getting into the emergence where we are people waking up but you don't want
[2:20:47.560 --> 2:20:52.120]  to talk about yourself but the process everybody's watching this what is the
[2:20:52.120 --> 2:20:58.440]  vindication like to be there 30 years ago top BBC show coming out saying this
[2:20:58.440 --> 2:21:03.000]  being ridiculed laughed at by an audience of hundreds millions watching
[2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:06.040]  worldwide and then what is it like to be
[2:21:06.040 --> 2:21:09.000]  because you didn't you were smiling then you knew that you were right
[2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:12.520]  to now be vindicated because I've had that happen
[2:21:12.520 --> 2:21:16.040]  in a similar way probably not as intense as you
[2:21:16.040 --> 2:21:19.240]  but but overall just as intense in the aggregate
[2:21:19.240 --> 2:21:22.360]  and I knew then I was right so it wasn't about what was happening to me because
[2:21:22.360 --> 2:21:25.960]  then it was happening to us all but what is that process like is so many other
[2:21:25.960 --> 2:21:29.240]  people have been ridiculed they've been attacked for telling the truth and
[2:21:29.240 --> 2:21:34.120]  they're vindicated as well and so now that we enter this new
[2:21:34.120 --> 2:21:38.280]  system what do you expect the enemy to do next so two questions what's it like to
[2:21:38.280 --> 2:21:42.200]  be vindicated and then what do you expect to happen next
[2:21:42.200 --> 2:21:46.520]  well vindication is not something you were
[2:21:46.520 --> 2:21:49.720]  actually looking for what you were looking for was to
[2:21:49.720 --> 2:21:53.400]  alert enough people that this was real that it would be
[2:21:53.400 --> 2:21:57.800]  headed off but it was clear that wasn't going to happen
[2:21:57.800 --> 2:22:02.120]  as I said many times this has got to get really really bad
[2:22:02.120 --> 2:22:05.880]  before we turn this around because it's got to get really bad before enough
[2:22:05.880 --> 2:22:09.560]  minds are focused I've just been listening to previous
[2:22:09.560 --> 2:22:15.080]  guests to see actually what a situation we're in
[2:22:15.080 --> 2:22:18.840]  because what you're doing when you're
[2:22:18.840 --> 2:22:22.520]  telling people what they don't want to hear
[2:22:22.520 --> 2:22:26.600]  and that's what you know people like me and you and the alternative media have
[2:22:26.600 --> 2:22:30.280]  been doing over the years is telling people what they don't
[2:22:30.280 --> 2:22:35.880]  want to hear who the hell wants to hear that a
[2:22:35.880 --> 2:22:43.240]  deeply evil satanic cabal is seeking to impose
[2:22:43.240 --> 2:22:46.280]  a horrors on the human race who wants to believe that
[2:22:46.280 --> 2:22:50.120]  so if you're telling people what they want to hear
[2:22:50.120 --> 2:22:55.080]  which is what the the opponents of the alternative media are doing
[2:22:55.080 --> 2:22:58.600]  oh no don't listen to them it's not like that sort it's just a conspiracy theory
[2:22:58.600 --> 2:23:03.160]  that's not going on people they want to believe it's not going on
[2:23:03.160 --> 2:23:07.320]  so their door is swinging open so the people who are telling them what they
[2:23:07.320 --> 2:23:10.680]  want to hear it's all right everything's fine
[2:23:10.680 --> 2:23:13.960]  they're pushing against the swinging door when you're telling people what they
[2:23:13.960 --> 2:23:16.440]  don't want to hear you're pushing against a
[2:23:16.440 --> 2:23:20.440]  locked door and so for that that door to
[2:23:20.440 --> 2:23:26.120]  to open that people have got to see increasing
[2:23:26.120 --> 2:23:31.160]  tangible evidence in the changes in society and the daily lives
[2:23:31.160 --> 2:23:37.400]  but actually this is real and while the Covid period has been horrific
[2:23:37.400 --> 2:23:40.680]  it's also been a massive wake-up call for so many people
[2:23:40.680 --> 2:23:46.040]  because the conspiracy theory I loved a line I heard
[2:23:46.040 --> 2:23:49.720]  yesterday's conspiracy theory theory is today's breaking news
[2:23:49.720 --> 2:23:55.320]  I'm just so so right they're now beginning to see that this is not some
[2:23:55.320 --> 2:24:01.800]  fantasy it's actually real and the vindication
[2:24:01.800 --> 2:24:09.640]  is not really about oh see I told you it's about the realization
[2:24:09.640 --> 2:24:15.640]  of great tracks of the population now that this is real
[2:24:15.640 --> 2:24:20.760]  that's that's what the vindication really means
[2:24:20.760 --> 2:24:24.920]  and that's a fantastic a perfect answer it's the shared community that we're
[2:24:24.920 --> 2:24:27.800]  finally waking up together so the vindication is we're now
[2:24:27.800 --> 2:24:31.640]  together we've got a better chance people are waking up
[2:24:31.640 --> 2:24:35.960]  yeah it's not about you know an individual being vindicated
[2:24:35.960 --> 2:24:42.040]  so much as people seeing that those people were right
[2:24:42.040 --> 2:24:46.840]  bringing them to the table and bringing them to a point where
[2:24:46.840 --> 2:24:50.920]  they're no longer being scammed by being told a lie and it's all
[2:24:50.920 --> 2:24:53.880]  fine and this is not going on when actually it is
[2:24:53.880 --> 2:24:58.280]  and you know going back to what I said earlier about
[2:24:58.280 --> 2:25:02.280]  there comes a point where you can't operate below the radar
[2:25:02.280 --> 2:25:06.600]  anymore because you've got to change society in the world of the scene
[2:25:06.600 --> 2:25:10.600]  you can't manipulate towards it anymore it's got to happen
[2:25:10.600 --> 2:25:16.920]  so you can't hide it and so this is yes a dangerous time for the human race
[2:25:16.920 --> 2:25:19.720]  but my goodness it's a dangerous time for these
[2:25:19.720 --> 2:25:23.080]  pillocks in the in what I call the global cold
[2:25:23.080 --> 2:25:27.720]  because they're now on public display I mean we we chatted about this
[2:25:27.720 --> 2:25:31.720]  right at the start of the the COVID thing when I said
[2:25:31.720 --> 2:25:35.560]  they've actually come into the room and they've just heard the door click behind
[2:25:35.560 --> 2:25:38.840]  it because now they can be seen and more and more
[2:25:38.840 --> 2:25:41.480]  people are saying I mean it's unbelievable
[2:25:41.480 --> 2:25:46.040]  the number of people that stopped me who I never would have thought
[2:25:46.040 --> 2:25:49.080]  you know from their background and everything that they would ever have
[2:25:49.080 --> 2:25:53.720]  seen this but they're seeing it so this is a time of
[2:25:53.720 --> 2:25:58.680]  enormous optimism as well as I totally agree
[2:25:58.680 --> 2:26:02.600]  it's not me bragging but I go to liberal areas and eat at restaurants now
[2:26:02.600 --> 2:26:06.680]  and they buy my food almost every time and I get standing ovations
[2:26:06.680 --> 2:26:09.880]  and liberals coming up and apologizing saying they were wrong
[2:26:09.880 --> 2:26:12.680]  everywhere I go now I was downtown last night with a podcast
[2:26:12.680 --> 2:26:16.200]  but everywhere that's a bellwether I guess that's what you're getting to
[2:26:16.200 --> 2:26:19.880]  David right and when you're in England
[2:26:19.880 --> 2:26:23.960]  yeah I mean in the early 1990s and actually
[2:26:23.960 --> 2:26:26.840]  throughout the 1990s and across the millennium
[2:26:26.840 --> 2:26:30.280]  you know I was I was a figure of ridicule in this country
[2:26:30.280 --> 2:26:33.640]  I'm further afield actually but certainly in this country
[2:26:33.640 --> 2:26:38.040]  you know in the early 90s I couldn't walk down the street without being laughed at
[2:26:38.040 --> 2:26:41.480]  going into a bar was I mean forget it there was uproar
[2:26:41.480 --> 2:26:47.400]  um and so when people say people aren't waking up fast enough
[2:26:47.400 --> 2:26:50.520]  I say you should have been around
[2:26:50.520 --> 2:26:54.840]  yeah years ago there was nobody awake then virtually
[2:26:54.840 --> 2:26:59.240]  you know what's happening now I can tell you from experience of seeing it
[2:26:59.240 --> 2:27:03.240]  develop and you too it's phenomenal
[2:27:03.240 --> 2:27:06.360]  and all we need to do is keep building on this and building on this and building
[2:27:06.360 --> 2:27:10.280]  on this because you know it takes a long time
[2:27:10.280 --> 2:27:15.960]  uh yeah there I am 1991 it takes a long time
[2:27:15.960 --> 2:27:20.040]  uh for the cracks to appear in a dam you know the
[2:27:20.040 --> 2:27:23.560]  the water the body of water is pushing against it but
[2:27:23.560 --> 2:27:27.320]  it takes a long time for the cracks appear but when the cracks appear in the
[2:27:27.320 --> 2:27:30.440]  dam to the dam collapsing can be a very short time
[2:27:30.440 --> 2:27:33.160]  and I know you don't want to talk about yourself but we're going to go to break
[2:27:33.160 --> 2:27:35.320]  a minute and a half we've got long segments coming up
[2:27:35.320 --> 2:27:38.920]  but you are a very interesting person I admire you I love you I appreciate you
[2:27:38.920 --> 2:27:43.480]  you're a great soul you're an inspiration why were you
[2:27:43.480 --> 2:27:47.480]  woken up why why were you out of everybody out there

[2:31:01.320 --> 2:31:07.320]  that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty as
[2:31:07.320 --> 2:31:12.840]  the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist
[2:31:12.840 --> 2:31:17.560]  anti-human program and man our work is really

[2:32:01.800 --> 2:32:05.240]  really satisfying empowering and fulfilling
[2:32:05.240 --> 2:32:09.800]  it's going to be hard to attain and when it comes to information
[2:32:09.800 --> 2:32:13.960]  boy is that true today we see the entire global corrupt
[2:32:13.960 --> 2:32:18.200]  anti-human depopulation great recent combine
[2:32:18.200 --> 2:32:21.720]  trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes their
[2:32:21.720 --> 2:32:26.360]  their transhumanist nightmare vision suppressing the voices
[2:32:26.360 --> 2:32:30.280]  of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and
[2:32:30.280 --> 2:32:33.720]  engineers that are exposing all their lives their
[2:32:33.720 --> 2:32:37.720]  coveted hysteria their world's gonna end in 2030 carbon
[2:32:37.720 --> 2:32:43.160]  tax global warming bull all of it and none of it can succeed none of it can
[2:32:43.160 --> 2:32:47.320]  actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit
[2:32:47.320 --> 2:32:51.400]  that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence
[2:32:51.400 --> 2:32:55.240]  that's why it's hard to share info wars links and band up video links
[2:32:55.240 --> 2:32:58.680]  that's why we've got to share them now more than ever
[2:32:58.680 --> 2:33:03.160]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order
[2:33:03.160 --> 2:33:06.600]  it's alex jones
[2:33:07.960 --> 2:33:14.040]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front
[2:33:14.040 --> 2:33:20.600]  lines of the info war
[2:33:20.600 --> 2:33:25.080]  i think it's important to know the origin story of david ight because
[2:33:25.080 --> 2:33:30.120]  folks i've read all his books and the older i get the more i experience
[2:33:30.120 --> 2:33:33.720]  the more i know he's over the target and there's nobody else like him he doesn't
[2:33:33.720 --> 2:33:37.400]  want to talk about himself but we need to celebrate people
[2:33:37.400 --> 2:33:41.880]  that are special and and are leading the way and and of all the special people
[2:33:41.880 --> 2:33:47.400]  amazing people to talk to david ight is undoubtedly the most important
[2:33:47.400 --> 2:33:51.640]  and i think recognizing that is important for all of us is a model of what we
[2:33:51.640 --> 2:33:55.320]  can do and what we can be and many of you will do even greater things
[2:33:55.320 --> 2:33:58.920]  than david ight or i have others have done we must do this we're human
[2:33:58.920 --> 2:34:02.840]  we're amazing but as a spiritual being as a
[2:34:02.840 --> 2:34:07.400]  creature of of of energy we now know historically with science what you said
[2:34:07.400 --> 2:34:12.360]  30 years ago is true these things that are attacking us are obviously
[2:34:12.360 --> 2:34:15.320]  weak and pathetic we're not aware of them that's why they're successful
[2:34:15.320 --> 2:34:19.400]  but to understand how to be successful you need to retrospectively i've never
[2:34:19.400 --> 2:34:23.960]  heard you speak this no you went to peru and i got a vision and i i've had
[2:34:23.960 --> 2:34:28.600]  similar things happen but a download but why was david ight and look i'm not
[2:34:28.600 --> 2:34:33.640]  saying anglophiles are special or that the united kingdom special or the
[2:34:33.640 --> 2:34:37.560]  british isles are special but so many of the prominent people fighting the new
[2:34:37.560 --> 2:34:41.880]  world order are from the british isles and so many
[2:34:41.880 --> 2:34:46.040]  selling the new world order it seems to be an epicenter of both light and dark
[2:34:46.040 --> 2:34:49.960]  evil and good so why would the two most iconic people it's not bragging it's
[2:34:49.960 --> 2:34:53.480]  true fighting the new world order agenda david ight and alex jones
[2:34:53.480 --> 2:34:57.800]  why are we both Celtic why are we both welsh why do we both come from the same
[2:34:57.800 --> 2:35:00.920]  place i mean what's going on there david what is your origin
[2:35:00.920 --> 2:35:07.960]  why have you been chosen for this well you know the
[2:35:07.960 --> 2:35:15.800]  the the planet has a network a grid a plexus of energetic lines of
[2:35:15.800 --> 2:35:19.240]  force they go through the planet they go
[2:35:19.240 --> 2:35:23.480]  around the planet some people call them lay lines they're called dragon lines in
[2:35:23.480 --> 2:35:30.760]  the east they're part of ancient culture and where
[2:35:30.760 --> 2:35:39.640]  these lines cross a vortex is created which if lots of lines cross at that
[2:35:39.640 --> 2:35:45.160]  point a massive vortex is created and this is where the ancients put their
[2:35:45.160 --> 2:35:48.680]  standing stone circles this is where they put their
[2:35:48.680 --> 2:35:54.440]  sacred places because of this this this vortex this this power
[2:35:54.440 --> 2:35:59.080]  center and from what i've learned over the last
[2:35:59.080 --> 2:36:05.000]  three decades what we call the british isles is a
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:11.960]  is the heart center of the grid where most lines cross and you know it's
[2:36:11.960 --> 2:36:16.120]  interesting you put up that that shot there of the stones
[2:36:16.120 --> 2:36:20.520]  there are more standing stone circles more earthworks more ancient earthworks
[2:36:20.520 --> 2:36:26.840]  more standing stones in britain per square mile
[2:36:26.840 --> 2:36:33.480]  than anywhere else in the world and so what what they want to do if you see
[2:36:33.480 --> 2:36:40.280]  because this the energy the frequency the perceptual
[2:36:40.280 --> 2:36:46.680]  energetic state of this grid is impacting upon
[2:36:46.680 --> 2:36:50.200]  the the field of energy of consciousness that we're all interacting
[2:36:50.200 --> 2:36:54.760]  with if you can control this energetic state
[2:36:54.760 --> 2:36:58.360]  and the perceptual state of the energetic field
[2:36:58.360 --> 2:37:02.120]  that we're interacting with imagine you know like a computer interacting with
[2:37:02.120 --> 2:37:06.120]  wi-fi then you can impact upon the
[2:37:06.120 --> 2:37:10.760]  perceptions of the whole population it there's so much mind control and
[2:37:10.760 --> 2:37:13.320]  perception control is actually happening
[2:37:13.320 --> 2:37:17.160]  energetically through frequency and i totally agree you had that vision in
[2:37:17.160 --> 2:37:21.000]  peru when i finally got the stone hedge off the side of the highway okay big
[2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:23.800]  deal and i walk right across this line again like
[2:37:23.800 --> 2:37:27.560]  energized have all this ancestral memory and then the park ranger goes only
[2:37:27.560 --> 2:37:30.840]  about a third of people have it it's some kind of genetic code but i watch
[2:37:30.840 --> 2:37:34.760]  people walk across that line and get hit by it and then i try to do it later the
[2:37:34.760 --> 2:37:37.240]  message already been split it's something heavy
[2:37:37.240 --> 2:37:40.920]  and so why is it why is it then manifesting such good
[2:37:40.920 --> 2:37:44.280]  and such bad well i mean what's happening well
[2:37:44.280 --> 2:37:51.720]  you see when um you have um these low orbit satellites
[2:37:51.720 --> 2:37:57.960]  mr musk mr free speech pounding this 5g and other wi-fi
[2:37:57.960 --> 2:38:02.840]  at the at the earth creating this cloud every inch of the planet
[2:38:02.840 --> 2:38:10.200]  what are they doing they're firing technologically generated frequencies
[2:38:10.200 --> 2:38:13.720]  into the field that we're all interacting with
[2:38:13.720 --> 2:38:17.800]  they're changing it they're impacting upon human awareness human consciousness
[2:38:17.800 --> 2:38:22.920]  human perception via this frequency interaction
[2:38:22.920 --> 2:38:30.040]  and so um who controls the grid in terms of its frequency
[2:38:30.040 --> 2:38:33.560]  state it's high frequency it's going to influence people
[2:38:33.560 --> 2:38:37.160]  in a into a high frequency state it's in a low frequency state
[2:38:37.160 --> 2:38:40.600]  it's going to bring you down into that low frequency state and
[2:38:40.600 --> 2:38:44.840]  this is why the satanists and other expressions of this cult
[2:38:44.840 --> 2:38:49.480]  they target these energy points they do their satanic rituals on them
[2:38:49.480 --> 2:38:52.920]  because they want to put very low vibrational energy
[2:38:52.920 --> 2:38:57.160]  into this grid because that then starts to impact on human perception so you've
[2:38:57.160 --> 2:39:01.080]  got this situation um with the british isles this is i mean
[2:39:01.080 --> 2:39:04.840]  look at the british isles how they look at the size of the bloody place
[2:39:04.840 --> 2:39:08.920]  why has it been such a central point in history
[2:39:08.920 --> 2:39:15.320]  why did it have the global empire on which the sun never set
[2:39:15.320 --> 2:39:19.720]  why has this global cult parked its ass
[2:39:19.720 --> 2:39:25.560]  in britain overwhelmingly because it's the heart center of the grid
[2:39:25.560 --> 2:39:29.480]  and they are seeking to control that heart center
[2:39:29.480 --> 2:39:35.720]  and thus the grid now this this frequency these vortices
[2:39:35.720 --> 2:39:40.440]  and the british isles is a massive vortex operates on low frequencies that's
[2:39:40.440 --> 2:39:43.560]  what the cults after that's why they come here
[2:39:43.560 --> 2:39:47.320]  and then there is high level frequencies of the vortex
[2:39:47.320 --> 2:39:51.480]  and that's why the spiritual people come here that's why those
[2:39:51.480 --> 2:39:55.720]  working to protect human freedom come here
[2:39:55.720 --> 2:39:59.480]  because they're operating different at different frequency levels
[2:39:59.480 --> 2:40:03.480]  of the power center the common denominator
[2:40:03.480 --> 2:40:10.280]  is it's a power center if you can dictate or control or influence
[2:40:10.280 --> 2:40:14.280]  the frequency state of the heart center the british isles
[2:40:14.280 --> 2:40:18.360]  then you impact on the heart center of the uh you impact on the
[2:40:18.360 --> 2:40:22.040]  under how does that tie into play doh claiming atlantis was by the british
[2:40:22.040 --> 2:40:26.200]  isles is there any truth to that he describes like flying ships and energy
[2:40:26.200 --> 2:40:33.320]  vortices well you see this um this reality
[2:40:33.320 --> 2:40:38.360]  that we call physical it's just a uh a holographic
[2:40:38.360 --> 2:40:41.400]  illusion it's not really physical we experience and interact with it just
[2:40:41.400 --> 2:40:43.640]  physical because that's part of the illusion
[2:40:43.640 --> 2:40:50.760]  but the foundation state is energetic information like the body
[2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:54.280]  in its base state is an energetic field of information
[2:40:54.280 --> 2:40:59.960]  the the the the the holographic body that we
[2:40:59.960 --> 2:41:03.720]  experience as physical is a projection of that
[2:41:03.720 --> 2:41:07.720]  that field so if you look for instance at
[2:41:07.720 --> 2:41:11.560]  alternative methods of healing they're not really
[2:41:11.560 --> 2:41:17.320]  targeting the hologram they're targeting the frequency field
[2:41:17.320 --> 2:41:20.680]  because if that frequency field is in harmony
[2:41:20.680 --> 2:41:24.120]  then the body which is a projection of that field
[2:41:24.120 --> 2:41:31.400]  is in harmony it's well it's um healthy so imagine when people say oh no these
[2:41:31.400 --> 2:41:35.240]  these technological frequencies they don't affect your body
[2:41:35.240 --> 2:41:39.240]  well they do because what they affect is the frequency field of the body
[2:41:39.240 --> 2:41:43.800]  so you've got an energetic frequency field which on on on one level
[2:41:43.800 --> 2:41:47.640]  that we uh that we experience it is electromagnetic it's an electromagnetic
[2:41:47.640 --> 2:41:50.760]  field some people call it the auric field
[2:41:50.760 --> 2:41:55.560]  and now it's being bloody bombarded from towers and
[2:41:55.560 --> 2:42:00.680]  and um from space by technological frequencies
[2:42:00.680 --> 2:42:05.560]  of great disharmonious nature and so it's
[2:42:05.560 --> 2:42:10.200]  disharmonizing the energetic field of the body
[2:42:10.200 --> 2:42:15.080]  and thus it's causing illness because as the
[2:42:15.080 --> 2:42:20.200]  the as the the the information foundation of the holographic body we call
[2:42:20.200 --> 2:42:24.120]  physical what's happening in the field is happening in the body they're just
[2:42:24.120 --> 2:42:28.200]  expressions of each other so you um
[2:42:28.200 --> 2:42:33.160]  disharmonize the field and you disharmonize the body and we call
[2:42:33.160 --> 2:42:37.400]  that not only physical illness we call that
[2:42:37.400 --> 2:42:41.320]  psychological and mental illness because if you um
[2:42:41.320 --> 2:42:44.440]  look at how the brain works what how does it communicate
[2:42:44.440 --> 2:42:47.640]  how does the brain communicate stay there javadike is on fire

[2:48:55.880 --> 2:49:00.120]  you're a real mentor to me i love you i appreciate you i see how right you were
[2:49:00.120 --> 2:49:03.960]  um speak on whatever you want the last 10 minutes we have
[2:49:03.960 --> 2:49:07.000]  but i'd like to know what you think's coming in the future what message you
[2:49:07.000 --> 2:49:10.040]  should give to folks because you've been taken off everything but your own
[2:49:10.040 --> 2:49:14.760]  independent sites and our sites and so i think listeners should understand that
[2:49:14.760 --> 2:49:17.800]  we're going to some very serious times and there may be a point where they
[2:49:17.800 --> 2:49:21.160]  can't hear us anymore so what is your advice to people about
[2:49:21.160 --> 2:49:26.040]  this battle this final big battle we're going into?
[2:49:26.040 --> 2:49:33.480]  well you know people do what they do because they perceive what they do
[2:49:33.480 --> 2:49:37.160]  they perceive as they do and so they behave as they do
[2:49:37.160 --> 2:49:42.440]  behavior just follows perception and perception is formed by information
[2:49:42.440 --> 2:49:46.040]  received and if you want to control the behavior
[2:49:46.040 --> 2:49:49.720]  of the population you control the perceptions of the population
[2:49:49.720 --> 2:49:53.160]  and you control the perceptions of the population by making sure they only
[2:49:53.160 --> 2:49:55.880]  hear the information that will have them form the
[2:49:55.880 --> 2:50:00.280]  perceptions you want them to have so the very
[2:50:00.280 --> 2:50:07.640]  foundation of protecting freedom is to protect
[2:50:07.640 --> 2:50:15.320]  alternative sources of information you know in the years of covid
[2:50:15.320 --> 2:50:19.880]  this cult got a great deal of what it wanted
[2:50:19.880 --> 2:50:27.560]  it got nothing like so far all that it wanted and the reason it didn't
[2:50:27.560 --> 2:50:33.960]  was the alternative media that were able to expose the lies and put forward
[2:50:33.960 --> 2:50:38.120]  another explanation for what the hell was going on
[2:50:38.120 --> 2:50:45.160]  so now they prepare for another pandemic hoax
[2:50:45.160 --> 2:50:49.160]  covid or bird flu or whatever they come up with
[2:50:49.160 --> 2:50:52.840]  and they're thinking what do we have to do to get
[2:50:52.840 --> 2:50:58.680]  far more than we got the first time and right up the top of that list
[2:50:58.680 --> 2:51:02.520]  will be we've got to destroy the alternative media and that's what's
[2:51:02.520 --> 2:51:06.120]  happening not just in attacks on you but attacks
[2:51:06.120 --> 2:51:12.280]  through legislation we've got a law going through the British
[2:51:12.280 --> 2:51:15.720]  parliament currently there are similar ones in other countries
[2:51:15.720 --> 2:51:19.480]  called the online safety bill which will give
[2:51:19.480 --> 2:51:26.840]  off-com the broadcast and now internet regulator
[2:51:26.840 --> 2:51:30.440]  censor of the British government created by Tony Blair
[2:51:30.440 --> 2:51:34.840]  how bad it is it will give them the power
[2:51:34.840 --> 2:51:40.600]  to decide what can be posted and what can't not on the basis of what is lawful
[2:51:40.600 --> 2:51:45.480]  or legal but on the basis of what it says or perceives
[2:51:45.480 --> 2:51:51.000]  or claims would might harm people that's right and what their third party
[2:51:51.000 --> 2:51:54.680]  leftist sorrows funded groups that advise them says that
[2:51:54.680 --> 2:51:58.520]  that's what's crazy is NGOs advise government because i know the same
[2:51:58.520 --> 2:52:03.000]  things in the uk canada australia the u.s if this is incredible
[2:52:03.000 --> 2:52:08.120]  yeah exactly and and they say oh it's to protect the children
[2:52:08.120 --> 2:52:12.200]  oh really well that'll be a bloody first one it
[2:52:12.200 --> 2:52:16.040]  it's to destroy the alternative media that's what it's for
[2:52:16.040 --> 2:52:20.600]  uh and so you know take your bandot video it's fantastic
[2:52:20.600 --> 2:52:24.440]  um it's a it's a fantastic contribution
[2:52:24.440 --> 2:52:28.360]  to the alternative media and it must not be allowed
[2:52:28.360 --> 2:52:33.160]  to to to disappear it must prosper oh it's so outrageous them David on
[2:52:33.160 --> 2:52:35.400]  average we have about five million views a day
[2:52:35.400 --> 2:52:39.560]  someday and it's it's it's beautiful and all this great stuff that people post
[2:52:39.560 --> 2:52:43.000]  there ends up going viral it's a launchpad and they are so
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:48.600]  enraged right now yeah and you know
[2:52:48.600 --> 2:52:52.520]  people need to understand too how much it costs to run these things i mean it is
[2:52:52.520 --> 2:52:56.600]  phenomenal we have iconic and you know if you're going to make a
[2:52:56.600 --> 2:53:00.920]  a classy documentary which is what what we we want to do
[2:53:00.920 --> 2:53:04.280]  then they don't come cheap you know uh so
[2:53:04.280 --> 2:53:08.200]  you know people can uh support in in that way
[2:53:08.200 --> 2:53:13.480]  a hundred percent you are totally a third of red like the Babe Ruth of Liberty
[2:53:13.480 --> 2:53:16.760]  and and and we're you know exactly people cannot
[2:53:16.760 --> 2:53:20.520]  bet on a place like davidike.com or info wars
[2:53:20.520 --> 2:53:24.200]  you cannot bet on something that is a more proven commodity we're not bragging
[2:53:24.200 --> 2:53:27.000]  it's just true and we just want to win this fight
[2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:31.080]  and we're so close yeah and you know i'm
[2:53:31.080 --> 2:53:36.040]  remain the the optimist on that but like i was saying earlier about you know the
[2:53:36.040 --> 2:53:40.600]  way the the the brain processes information into a perception
[2:53:40.600 --> 2:53:43.960]  it does it electrically and electromagnetically so all this stuff
[2:53:43.960 --> 2:53:47.160]  coming from the sky thank you mr musk you nice man
[2:53:47.160 --> 2:53:52.120]  very genuine um is is also targeting human perception and
[2:53:52.120 --> 2:53:57.240]  and scrambling the brain uh and uh so
[2:53:57.240 --> 2:54:03.320]  this uh whole um situation that we're facing
[2:54:03.320 --> 2:54:09.880]  is between states of consciousness consciousness that believes in freedom
[2:54:09.880 --> 2:54:13.080]  that believes in love and consciousness that is the
[2:54:13.080 --> 2:54:16.840]  inversion of that uh evil what is evil it's the absence of love that
[2:54:16.840 --> 2:54:19.480]  that's what that why these people do what they do
[2:54:19.480 --> 2:54:23.160]  and and so when people talk about this spiritual battle
[2:54:23.160 --> 2:54:26.840]  i don't like the word battle but you know it'll do because that's what we're
[2:54:26.840 --> 2:54:30.440]  looking at it's it's two states of consciousness
[2:54:30.440 --> 2:54:37.000]  um tussling for um for for for preeminence but for dominance of
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:41.320]  of of the perception really and in between
[2:54:41.320 --> 2:54:46.120]  are the the population and the population break down into
[2:54:46.120 --> 2:54:49.400]  basically three groups there's the group that's just what i call
[2:54:49.400 --> 2:54:53.880]  press enter people they just do what they do and do what they're told without
[2:54:53.880 --> 2:54:57.320]  question there's the second group that
[2:54:57.320 --> 2:55:00.440]  doesn't want to do that but he's terrified of not doing it what are the
[2:55:00.440 --> 2:55:04.440]  consequences for me and then there's the third group that says um i can see
[2:55:04.440 --> 2:55:08.280]  what's going on and i ain't i ain't cooperating and so if
[2:55:08.280 --> 2:55:12.360]  people want to defend freedom uh whether it's freedom of speech or freedom
[2:55:12.360 --> 2:55:15.800]  in general and the old basis of freedom is freedom to speak
[2:55:15.800 --> 2:55:19.240]  then that group i'm not sure about the first group maybe
[2:55:19.240 --> 2:55:24.680]  yet some but that second group that doesn't want to do what they're told to
[2:55:24.680 --> 2:55:27.960]  do but he's frightened of not doing so that's got to get into the third group
[2:55:27.960 --> 2:55:32.680]  that's got to come across and stop cooperating with your own enslavement
[2:55:32.680 --> 2:55:37.960]  because you know in the end there are billions of people being manipulated
[2:55:37.960 --> 2:55:41.800]  and in full knowledge of what they're doing there's a handful of people doing
[2:55:41.800 --> 2:55:47.000]  it so from that perspective alone i see a
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:51.640]  way out of this and the david i want you to speak to that in the two minutes we
[2:55:51.640 --> 2:55:54.920]  have left and please come back again soon we love you
[2:55:54.920 --> 2:55:59.960]  let me ask you this in closing i feel like i see we're really winning it's
[2:55:59.960 --> 2:56:02.680]  still going to be nasty it's going to be bad they seem desperate they seem
[2:56:02.680 --> 2:56:06.680]  scared i i think we're winning a is that true
[2:56:06.680 --> 2:56:11.080]  because i i i mean i believe what you say is it true we're starting to win
[2:56:11.080 --> 2:56:15.080]  and then what does it look like what is the human victory
[2:56:15.080 --> 2:56:22.280]  past these people well i'm in in that in answer to that i would say
[2:56:22.280 --> 2:56:27.640]  look what it was like in terms of awareness of the population of what
[2:56:27.640 --> 2:56:32.440]  the hell's going on where it's meant to go and who's behind it
[2:56:32.440 --> 2:56:35.960]  look at the knowledge of that and the awareness of the population
[2:56:35.960 --> 2:56:47.880]  in 1990 look in even 2000 look in 2010 and look now
[2:56:47.880 --> 2:56:53.640]  the awakening is fantastic and it's exponential because the more that
[2:56:53.640 --> 2:56:59.480]  awaken the more awakened people are there are because of the
[2:56:59.480 --> 2:57:03.240]  interaction and the communication of information and the the awareness that
[2:57:03.240 --> 2:57:07.800]  comes from that so i'm i'm i'm optimistic and you know
[2:57:07.800 --> 2:57:11.240]  you look at these people this is the big thing alex you know
[2:57:11.240 --> 2:57:15.640]  we mustn't give these people power they don't

[2:58:54.680 --> 2:58:58.120]  mission continues on i was born for this
[2:58:58.120 --> 2:59:02.120]  you were born for this and people are really waking up right now but we had
[2:59:02.120 --> 2:59:05.480]  to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship
[2:59:05.480 --> 2:59:09.080]  and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars and now
[2:59:09.080 --> 2:59:12.280]  with bandot video getting close to 10 million views a day
[2:59:12.280 --> 2:59:16.440]  we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups
[2:59:16.440 --> 2:59:20.760]  to be able to post their content free of charge and because
[2:59:20.760 --> 2:59:26.520]  it's become so successful it's a catch-22 info wars and bandot video have
[2:59:26.520 --> 2:59:30.600]  become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide
[2:59:30.600 --> 2:59:35.240]  but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter
[2:59:35.240 --> 2:59:38.040]  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month so
[2:59:38.040 --> 2:59:41.800]  the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now the mega emergency blowout
[2:59:41.800 --> 2:59:45.000]  sale up to 75 off getting credible products and
[2:59:45.000 --> 2:59:52.760]  keep info wars as strong as ever if you are receiving this transmission
[2:59:52.760 --> 3:00:20.520]  you are the resistance
[3:00:20.520 --> 3:00:23.800]  david ike i think this is my question in closing we really appreciate your time
[3:00:23.800 --> 3:00:26.040]  today
[3:00:26.760 --> 3:00:30.120]  obviously there's been other civilizations before this obviously this is
[3:00:30.120 --> 3:00:35.080]  something bigger than a jewelry we're eternal we know that
[3:00:35.080 --> 3:00:39.320]  and obviously the blood attacking us these things aren't really powerful
[3:00:39.320 --> 3:00:42.600]  we're just aware of them that's why they're having victory but
[3:00:42.600 --> 3:00:46.280]  this could be the last time we ever talk i'm not saying that i'm saying
[3:00:46.280 --> 3:00:50.120]  with the kill switches with the wars with everything this group is doing to
[3:00:50.120 --> 3:00:53.640]  try to suppress humanity they may launch world war three who knows i
[3:00:53.640 --> 3:00:57.480]  believe we can stop it together but if this is the last four minutes ever
[3:00:57.480 --> 3:01:01.560]  that you have to talk to people what are you going to say to them
[3:01:01.560 --> 3:01:07.880]  we are going to win this when we realize
[3:01:07.880 --> 3:01:12.200]  that we're not dealing with an all powerful force
[3:01:12.200 --> 3:01:18.120]  we're dealing with a force that has one gift and that is the knowledge and the
[3:01:18.120 --> 3:01:21.640]  ability to hijack the perception of the target
[3:01:21.640 --> 3:01:29.240]  population and key to that hijack is to persuade us
[3:01:29.240 --> 3:01:35.640]  the billions that they the handful have power
[3:01:35.640 --> 3:01:43.320]  they do not have power they have only the power that we give to it
[3:01:43.320 --> 3:01:48.520]  in the form of acquiescence so when out the power we give to them
[3:01:48.520 --> 3:01:53.080]  is recycled back against us our perception is they have power what we
[3:01:53.080 --> 3:01:55.320]  miss is the first part of the feedback loop
[3:01:55.320 --> 3:01:59.880]  which is us giving them their power so if we fall
[3:01:59.880 --> 3:02:03.400]  for the fact that there's a deadly virus in the spring of 2020
[3:02:03.400 --> 3:02:08.120]  and the only way of being protected from this deadly virus is to meekly go
[3:02:08.120 --> 3:02:11.400]  under house arrest then the perception that that's how things
[3:02:11.400 --> 3:02:15.000]  are will have billions of people meekly going under house arrest
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:18.120]  if people won't have it and do their own thinking
[3:02:18.120 --> 3:02:21.240]  they don't do that they don't meekly go under house arrest
[3:02:21.240 --> 3:02:25.480]  everything comes from perception because all behavior
[3:02:25.480 --> 3:02:30.520]  comes from that we are not dealing with an all powerful force
[3:02:30.520 --> 3:02:34.840]  we're dealing with a force that has hijacked and
[3:02:34.840 --> 3:02:39.080]  hoarded knowledge not just about the agenda
[3:02:39.080 --> 3:02:42.600]  but knowledge about reality and these things i was talking about earlier
[3:02:42.600 --> 3:02:47.000]  that what the body is and the effect of these technological frequencies and
[3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:50.760]  the nature of the frequency state the planet now the vortices work and the
[3:02:50.760 --> 3:02:55.320]  lay lines work all that is hoarded in the secret society network
[3:02:55.320 --> 3:02:59.080]  why why why is it a network of secret societies
[3:02:59.080 --> 3:03:04.680]  to keep secrets who from the population so we've got two worlds we've got the
[3:03:04.680 --> 3:03:08.200]  world of the cult where they're handing through the generations
[3:03:08.200 --> 3:03:11.960]  through the the initiations etc of the secret societies
[3:03:11.960 --> 3:03:14.760]  knowledge they don't want the public to have
[3:03:14.760 --> 3:03:18.680]  and the public are set up to be ignorant
[3:03:18.680 --> 3:03:23.960]  of everything they know so these people have created the education system
[3:03:23.960 --> 3:03:28.520]  look what they're doing to the kids making them knowledgeable people know
[3:03:28.520 --> 3:03:33.640]  programming that programming them to be robots to be press enter people
[3:03:33.640 --> 3:03:38.040]  they control the media controlling information what is the education system
[3:03:38.040 --> 3:03:41.720]  controlling information that the children and young people
[3:03:41.720 --> 3:03:46.040]  receive so what they're doing in the among the population
[3:03:46.040 --> 3:03:50.360]  is suppressing knowledge not least about reality
[3:03:50.360 --> 3:03:55.240]  but also about the agenda that they are pursuing
[3:03:55.240 --> 3:04:01.960]  so they want to keep the population blind of from what they know
[3:04:01.960 --> 3:04:08.120]  and it's very very relevant and so symbolically perfect
[3:04:08.120 --> 3:04:14.040]  but one of the key symbols of this cult
[3:04:14.040 --> 3:04:20.920]  is the all-seeing eye the single eye and that's what it is
[3:04:20.920 --> 3:04:26.760]  compared with two-eyed third-eyed humans it's a single all-seeing eye
[3:04:26.760 --> 3:04:34.920]  uh actually not all-seeing eye it thinks it is and so if you look at this
[3:04:34.920 --> 3:04:42.840]  phrase in the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed man is king
[3:04:42.840 --> 3:04:50.600]  they have not got the power over us they have manipulated us
[3:04:50.600 --> 3:04:54.040]  to be in ignorance of their existence and what they know

[3:09:08.680 --> 3:09:13.000]  during which Piers Morgan lectured him about the quote fake news of claiming
[3:09:13.000 --> 3:09:17.080]  the 2020 election was rigged of course that's pretty rich
[3:09:17.080 --> 3:09:22.040]  coming from Piers Morgan who literally rose to prominence off the back of
[3:09:22.040 --> 3:09:25.480]  fake news before fake news was even a thing
[3:09:25.480 --> 3:09:29.800]  you'll remember back in 2004 or maybe many of you won't
[3:09:29.800 --> 3:09:34.200]  headline out bbc editor sacked over hoax photos
[3:09:34.200 --> 3:09:37.400]  he was the publisher of the mirror newspaper
[3:09:37.400 --> 3:09:43.240]  of fake mock-up photos of british troops supposedly abusing iraqi prisoners of
[3:09:43.240 --> 3:09:47.320]  war by peeing on them the story was completely
[3:09:47.320 --> 3:09:52.120]  fake the photos were completely fake it was one of the first
[3:09:52.120 --> 3:09:57.560]  primary examples of fake news so then you've got Morgan lecturing
[3:09:57.560 --> 3:10:01.160]  Trump throughout this interview about the quote fake news of the 2020 election
[3:10:01.160 --> 3:10:05.080]  being rigged you have him launching this new talk tv
[3:10:05.080 --> 3:10:09.080]  network off the back of a promo which i saw a couple of days ago
[3:10:09.080 --> 3:10:13.960]  of him saying oh we're gonna take on the woke snowflakes and the virtue signalers
[3:10:13.960 --> 3:10:19.000]  there was no bigger inauthentic fake phony virtue signaler
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:23.240]  than piers morgan for the past two years plus
[3:10:23.240 --> 3:10:27.960]  over the covid pandemic constantly demanding people be locked down harder
[3:10:27.960 --> 3:10:32.440]  lock me down harder daddy constantly demanding people wear face masks while
[3:10:32.440 --> 3:10:35.400]  he's caught numerous times in public
[3:10:35.400 --> 3:10:41.080]  without a face mask his own son went to a black lives matter rally just days
[3:10:41.080 --> 3:10:44.600]  after piers morgan said nobody should congregate in huge groups
[3:10:44.600 --> 3:10:47.880]  his own son goes to a black lives matter rally in london
[3:10:47.880 --> 3:10:52.760]  he congratulates his own son the guy is completely
[3:10:52.760 --> 3:10:56.120]  fraudulent and he has been for the past two years i've been telling people about
[3:10:56.120 --> 3:11:00.280]  that i've been warning people about that so he tries to create a fake news
[3:11:00.280 --> 3:11:05.480]  controversy by pretending that trump stormed out of this interview and in
[3:11:05.480 --> 3:11:08.920]  fact we've got the clip of this supposed trump
[3:11:08.920 --> 3:11:12.840]  storming out of the interview in anger let's go to the clip and then i'll
[3:11:12.840 --> 3:11:15.720]  talk about what really happened here it is
[3:11:15.720 --> 3:11:19.720]  if piers i'm ready a former president in denial i'll be completely straight
[3:11:19.720 --> 3:11:23.560]  to your face i think i'm a very honest man much more honest than you actually
[3:11:23.560 --> 3:11:28.760]  really yeah it was a free advantage he lost only a fool would thank you i do
[3:11:28.760 --> 3:11:32.360]  now yeah with excuse me okay with us the left is the heart of
[3:11:32.360 --> 3:11:36.120]  excuse me the most explosive interview of the year i don't think you're real
[3:11:36.120 --> 3:11:39.800]  this is i'm not like very dishonest let's finish up the interview morgan
[3:11:39.800 --> 3:11:46.360]  versus camera very dishonest
[3:11:46.360 --> 3:11:51.080]  so again that is clearly deceptively edited to suggest that donald trump
[3:11:51.080 --> 3:11:54.760]  stormed off because he was being grilled too harshly on the
[3:11:54.760 --> 3:12:00.120]  2020 election rigging question what actually happened was that piers morgan
[3:12:00.120 --> 3:12:05.080]  was given 20 minutes for that interview it went on for an hour and 20 minutes
[3:12:05.080 --> 3:12:08.920]  the end of the interview was completely cordial they were talking about trump
[3:12:08.920 --> 3:12:14.600]  getting a hole in one in a golf match and when trump says that's the end of the
[3:12:14.600 --> 3:12:18.120]  interview it's because he's gone over by an hour
[3:12:18.120 --> 3:12:21.720]  so they've spliced different parts of the interview together
[3:12:21.720 --> 3:12:25.480]  trump did accuse morgan of being dishonest on several occasions during
[3:12:25.480 --> 3:12:28.440]  the interview because that's his entire shtick
[3:12:28.440 --> 3:12:33.560]  but again this was a completely fabricated fake news story to try and
[3:12:33.560 --> 3:12:37.800]  drum up interest in this crappy new talk tv network
[3:12:37.800 --> 3:12:42.680]  rupert murdoch funded that piers morgan is now a part of that he is the primary
[3:12:42.680 --> 3:12:47.000]  face of again the reason that piers morgan
[3:12:47.000 --> 3:12:51.640]  is or was unemployed and he also got kicked off his cnn show because
[3:12:51.640 --> 3:12:56.840]  it hemorrhaged viewers like cnn plus is doing now
[3:12:56.840 --> 3:13:00.680]  it's for the same reason nobody's interested in his bluster in this fake
[3:13:00.680 --> 3:13:05.800]  act that he comes out with again he got the talk tv job because he
[3:13:05.800 --> 3:13:10.600]  stormed off a good morning britain confrontation with another host again
[3:13:10.600 --> 3:13:15.880]  completely staged fake controversy the hill reports trump
[3:13:15.880 --> 3:13:19.960]  piers morgan went out of his way to deceptively edit the interview
[3:13:19.960 --> 3:13:25.240]  and he's released the audio proving the duo in the audio trump provided
[3:13:25.240 --> 3:13:29.160]  thanked each other at the end of the interview set to air next week for the
[3:13:29.160 --> 3:13:33.320]  launch of piers morgan uncensored trump was heard saying turn the
[3:13:33.320 --> 3:13:36.760]  camera off once the conversation had ended and again
[3:13:36.760 --> 3:13:41.160]  that was after they cordially ended the interview and basically said
[3:13:41.160 --> 3:13:44.440]  piers morgan profusely thanked him for the interview
[3:13:44.440 --> 3:13:47.880]  they've taken a clip and put it together with this
[3:13:47.880 --> 3:13:52.200]  confrontation about the election rigging to try to make out as if trump
[3:13:52.200 --> 3:13:56.120]  stormed off because he couldn't handle the questions
[3:13:56.120 --> 3:14:00.200]  now you think that normally deceptively editing a clip
[3:14:00.200 --> 3:14:03.800]  and putting out deliberate disinformation misinformation
[3:14:03.800 --> 3:14:07.000]  would cause twitter to at least put a warning label
[3:14:07.000 --> 3:14:11.480]  on that clip but no they haven't brightbar reports twitter won't label
[3:14:11.480 --> 3:14:15.080]  piers morgan's misinformation about trump
[3:14:15.080 --> 3:14:18.680]  yesterday interviewer and controversy junkie piers morgan released a deceptively
[3:14:18.680 --> 3:14:22.680]  editor clip on social media appearing to show contentious end to an interview
[3:14:22.680 --> 3:14:27.800]  between himself and former president donald trump as you've just seen
[3:14:27.800 --> 3:14:31.240]  despite this tweets and unedited articles from the corporate media
[3:14:31.240 --> 3:14:36.360]  organizations that got the story wrong continue to spread freely on twitter
[3:14:36.360 --> 3:14:40.840]  the fact checkers have mysteriously vanished once again
[3:14:40.840 --> 3:14:45.880]  this was the biggest story overnight and the much vaunted fact checkers
[3:14:45.880 --> 3:14:49.960]  who are straight in now when it comes to any regime narrative that gets
[3:14:49.960 --> 3:14:54.360]  contradicted oh they're suddenly a wall again what a surprise
[3:14:54.360 --> 3:14:59.000]  twitter has a rule specific rule against quote deceptively edited media
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:03.480]  which the platform used as a pretext to take down clips of embarrassing joe
[3:15:03.480 --> 3:15:08.040]  biden gaps and again project veritas they hit them
[3:15:08.040 --> 3:15:12.120]  with it numerous times claiming that they deceptively edited videos
[3:15:12.120 --> 3:15:16.040]  when they merely edited videos because all videos are edited
[3:15:16.040 --> 3:15:19.400]  not deceptively but in this case it was a clear example
[3:15:19.400 --> 3:15:24.920]  of a deceptively edited video to push a misinformation narrative
[3:15:24.920 --> 3:15:27.640]  the original clip hasn't got a warning label on it
[3:15:27.640 --> 3:15:30.840]  none of the mainstream reporting has got a warning label on it
[3:15:30.840 --> 3:15:35.560]  and this is just going to be allowed to fly again and this is from the progenitor
[3:15:35.560 --> 3:15:39.080]  piaz morgan of fake news who produced one of the
[3:15:39.080 --> 3:15:43.480]  primary examples of fake news damaging as it was
[3:15:43.480 --> 3:15:49.080]  during the invasion and occupation of iraq back in 2003 2004
[3:15:49.080 --> 3:15:52.440]  we'll come back and see what my Nigel Farage had to say about it on the other
[3:15:52.440 --> 3:15:55.480]  side summit.news.go
[3:15:56.280 --> 3:15:59.640]  the globalists are bombarding us with propaganda
[3:15:59.640 --> 3:16:03.720]  and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the
[3:16:03.720 --> 3:16:07.640]  food it's all come out and they're doing that not because we're weak but
[3:16:07.640 --> 3:16:11.000]  because we're made the image of god the creator and we
[3:16:11.000 --> 3:16:15.560]  are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much
[3:16:15.560 --> 3:16:19.000]  so that's why i repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who
[3:16:19.000 --> 3:16:23.240]  first came up with the boy is it true
[3:16:23.240 --> 3:16:27.560]  the propaganda would not be necessary if the situation
[3:16:27.560 --> 3:16:31.640]  was hopeless they need all their propaganda and all their lies and all
[3:16:31.640 --> 3:16:35.480]  their evil and all their cultural death because
[3:16:35.480 --> 3:16:39.960]  they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god of this
[3:16:39.960 --> 3:16:42.760]  world who is a loser and that's why it's so
[3:16:42.760 --> 3:16:45.800]  important that everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever
[3:16:45.800 --> 3:16:49.480]  because even if you don't believe in god what the globalists are manifesting
[3:16:49.480 --> 3:16:53.160]  and setting up is satanic and we are opposing the one world
[3:16:53.160 --> 3:16:55.720]  government and the mark of the beast they just announced
[3:16:55.720 --> 3:16:59.640]  you know it's a fact and i'm not bragging when i say it it's just true
[3:16:59.640 --> 3:17:02.760]  that info wars is seen by the globalist as
[3:17:02.760 --> 3:17:09.400]  the standard of human liberty as the logo of human populist resistance
[3:17:09.400 --> 3:17:12.920]  against their transhumanist anti-human program
[3:17:12.920 --> 3:17:19.160]  and man our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects
[3:17:19.160 --> 3:17:23.240]  of what we've ever done so i'm asking listeners now to realize we've got

[3:20:01.800 --> 3:20:06.120]  it's alex jones
[3:20:06.120 --> 3:20:18.280]  live from the summit dot news headquarters
[3:20:18.280 --> 3:20:22.360]  it's paul joseph watson
[3:20:23.480 --> 3:20:26.520]  so trump came out with a statement after this
[3:20:26.520 --> 3:20:31.800]  got your fake controversy ginned up by piers morgan the king of fake news
[3:20:31.800 --> 3:20:35.960]  most americans don't know his history and it's literally the history of fake news
[3:20:35.960 --> 3:20:39.080]  when he was a newspaper publisher in britain
[3:20:39.080 --> 3:20:42.680]  trump said quote piers morgan like the rest of the fake news media center to
[3:20:42.680 --> 3:20:46.280]  unlawfully and deceptively edit his long and tedious interview with me
[3:20:46.280 --> 3:20:49.800]  he wanted to make it look like i walked out on the interview when my time limit
[3:20:49.800 --> 3:20:54.280]  of 20 minutes went over by an hour so again many people
[3:20:54.280 --> 3:20:57.080]  are asking the question why is he why is trump even
[3:20:57.080 --> 3:21:00.840]  giving these interviews to regime media outlets
[3:21:00.840 --> 3:21:04.440]  they're gonna make him look stupid they're gonna edit the interview and
[3:21:04.440 --> 3:21:08.280]  someone like piers morgan is specifically
[3:21:08.280 --> 3:21:11.960]  likely to do so given his history in the news business
[3:21:11.960 --> 3:21:15.720]  but nigel forage i'm told by his aides gave trump a full
[3:21:15.720 --> 3:21:20.120]  rundown a full history of piers morgan after this incident and in fact
[3:21:20.120 --> 3:21:24.520]  nigel forage put up a video about this this morning
[3:21:24.520 --> 3:21:29.080]  and we're going to play it now here is nigel forage on this issue
[3:21:29.080 --> 3:21:32.520]  so a major route has blown up overnight between donald trump
[3:21:32.520 --> 3:21:36.200]  and piers morgan or perhaps more accurately between donald trump and the
[3:21:36.200 --> 3:21:40.760]  murdoch media empire what's it all about well
[3:21:40.760 --> 3:21:44.360]  piers morgan of course launches his new show on monday
[3:21:44.360 --> 3:21:49.240]  he wrote a piece last night saying that just before he recorded an interview with
[3:21:49.240 --> 3:21:52.760]  trump he was presented with a dossier which showed
[3:21:52.760 --> 3:21:57.640]  the very very unpleasant things he'd said about the 45th president
[3:21:57.640 --> 3:22:01.720]  in his last few months in office and thereafter
[3:22:01.720 --> 3:22:05.480]  morgan accuses me of putting that document in
[3:22:05.480 --> 3:22:10.280]  trumps hands is it true well here is the truth
[3:22:10.280 --> 3:22:13.800]  a few days before morgan did the interview i was at mara lago
[3:22:13.800 --> 3:22:17.400]  i met with trump and we went out for dinner afterwards
[3:22:17.400 --> 3:22:22.120]  i said to him morgan has gone around boasting in uk media telling everybody
[3:22:22.120 --> 3:22:26.280]  that he's your friend that he's got special privileged access but in fact
[3:22:26.280 --> 3:22:29.960]  behind your back he's been stitching you up for a long time
[3:22:29.960 --> 3:22:33.560]  if you do this interview here is the truth and i gave him
[3:22:33.560 --> 3:22:37.800]  a document trump clearly was extremely displeased
[3:22:37.800 --> 3:22:42.120]  the interview because of that wasn't perhaps the friendliest
[3:22:42.120 --> 3:22:45.800]  it ever could have been but here's what makes this worse
[3:22:45.800 --> 3:22:50.040]  let's have a look at today's son front page okay
[3:22:50.040 --> 3:22:56.680]  it says x prayers storms out on morgan and the clip they're showing is trump
[3:22:56.680 --> 3:22:59.480]  saying turn off the cameras getting up from his chair
[3:22:59.480 --> 3:23:03.800]  and walking out it is let me tell you that headline there
[3:23:03.800 --> 3:23:09.560]  is fake news the interview had been concluded it was finished
[3:23:09.560 --> 3:23:13.480]  it was over they said their thank yous and trump got up
[3:23:13.480 --> 3:23:17.160]  to go on to his next appointment he has been completely and utterly
[3:23:17.160 --> 3:23:20.280]  stitched up by piers morgan it is disgraceful
[3:23:20.280 --> 3:23:25.080]  it is disgusting i bet rupert murdoch is absolutely fuming
[3:23:25.080 --> 3:23:30.840]  why would trump now trust fox news or any murdoch media empire
[3:23:30.840 --> 3:23:35.800]  i'm not surprised i have to say by any of this i really really am not
[3:23:35.800 --> 3:23:41.720]  but i will tell you the full story at seven o'clock tonight on gp news
[3:23:41.720 --> 3:23:44.360]  about what i said to president trump and his team
[3:23:44.360 --> 3:23:48.680]  about piers morgan and about other untruths that morgan has told
[3:23:48.680 --> 3:23:53.080]  in the course of the last 24 hours why would anybody
[3:23:53.080 --> 3:23:56.040]  want to be interviewed by a man that stitches them up
[3:23:56.040 --> 3:23:58.520]  like this
[3:23:59.000 --> 3:24:02.360]  so there you have it i'm going to move on now though because we have some
[3:24:02.360 --> 3:24:06.200]  current thing news headline out of summit news
[3:24:06.200 --> 3:24:10.040]  ukrainian tennis star demands russian players be subjected to
[3:24:10.040 --> 3:24:15.240]  ideological purity test now of course we've had this in
[3:24:15.240 --> 3:24:18.680]  hollywood in film over the past several years
[3:24:18.680 --> 3:24:23.160]  even in the literary world where authors have to sign a contract literally
[3:24:23.160 --> 3:24:27.000]  saying that if they're subject to cancellation
[3:24:27.000 --> 3:24:31.800]  if they don't carry the water in terms of the current narrative on whatever
[3:24:31.800 --> 3:24:36.440]  hot button issue is in current affairs then they can be cancelled their
[3:24:36.440 --> 3:24:40.120]  contracts can be cancelled and now we see a similar ideological
[3:24:40.120 --> 3:24:45.240]  purity test seeping into sports this ukrainian tennis star has
[3:24:45.240 --> 3:24:50.120]  demanded a leaner spill a leaner that russian and bell russian players be
[3:24:50.120 --> 3:24:53.560]  subjected to ideological purity tests before they're allowed to
[3:24:53.560 --> 3:24:57.720]  complete in international tournaments of course we've seen
[3:24:57.720 --> 3:25:01.960]  chess players russian chess players banned from international tournaments
[3:25:01.960 --> 3:25:06.120]  and then we've seen a case of two female
[3:25:06.120 --> 3:25:13.000]  ukrainian grand chess masters refusing to sign a document saying that all
[3:25:13.000 --> 3:25:16.040]  russians should be banned from chess tournaments these are
[3:25:16.040 --> 3:25:20.040]  ukrainian players and because these ukrainian players
[3:25:20.040 --> 3:25:23.160]  refused to say that all russians should be banned
[3:25:23.160 --> 3:25:28.360]  they were banned this is a total purge has nothing to do with the fact a lot
[3:25:28.360 --> 3:25:31.320]  of these players have come out and denounced the wall
[3:25:31.320 --> 3:25:35.480]  they've come out and said they want peace immediately it's not enough
[3:25:35.480 --> 3:25:38.920]  now the former world number three has insisted on a total ban on all russian
[3:25:38.920 --> 3:25:42.360]  and bell russian athletes if they fail to sign up to a series of
[3:25:42.360 --> 3:25:45.880]  statements regarding politics and the war in ukraine
[3:25:45.880 --> 3:25:49.400]  and you see the slippery slope on this first it's ukraine
[3:25:49.400 --> 3:25:53.880]  then it's covid then it's whatever else blm whatever the next
[3:25:53.880 --> 3:25:57.400]  issue current thing is shoved in front of our faces
[3:25:57.400 --> 3:26:01.800]  if you as a private citizen an athlete a sports person
[3:26:01.800 --> 3:26:05.480]  don't agree with it then your career is ruined
[3:26:05.480 --> 3:26:10.600]  this is how they make people ideologically subservent to whatever
[3:26:10.600 --> 3:26:14.520]  they want people to be the water carriers for
[3:26:14.520 --> 3:26:17.800]  she said we noticed that some russian and bell russian players at some point
[3:26:17.800 --> 3:26:21.160]  vaguely mentioned the war but never clearly stated that russia and bell
[3:26:21.160 --> 3:26:24.840]  russ started it on the territory of ukraine now of
[3:26:24.840 --> 3:26:28.520]  course that's avoiding an entire argument about how
[3:26:28.520 --> 3:26:32.520]  ukraine has been shelling dombas region for years on end
[3:26:32.520 --> 3:26:37.080]  now you can't be nuanced you have to condemn your own country
[3:26:37.080 --> 3:26:42.360]  in order to compete in a tennis tournament so she's demanded that russian
[3:26:42.360 --> 3:26:46.040]  and bell russian players answer these three questions
[3:26:46.040 --> 3:26:49.320]  one of which is do you support russia's and bell russ's invasion in ukraine's
[3:26:49.320 --> 3:26:52.200]  territory as a result of that war started by those
[3:26:52.200 --> 3:26:55.560]  countries they have to denounce their own governments
[3:26:55.560 --> 3:26:58.920]  they have to say who started the war who's responsible for it
[3:26:58.920 --> 3:27:02.040]  and if they don't all agree to do that then basically
[3:27:02.040 --> 3:27:05.160]  at least for the time being their careers are
[3:27:05.160 --> 3:27:09.720]  finished this is an ideological purity test and it starts with something
[3:27:09.720 --> 3:27:12.840]  like ukraine russia the next thing it could be
[3:27:12.840 --> 3:27:16.600]  the next round of lockdowns if you don't agree with that then you don't compete
[3:27:16.600 --> 3:27:19.480]  in a tournament we saw it with no vak jokovic
[3:27:19.480 --> 3:27:23.720]  simply refusing to state his vaccination status he was kicked out of
[3:27:23.720 --> 3:27:26.920]  the australian open and deported from the country
[3:27:26.920 --> 3:27:31.560]  now jokovic calls wimbledon ban on russian players crazy
[3:27:31.560 --> 3:27:35.800]  so this ukrainian tennis player in insisting
[3:27:35.800 --> 3:27:39.960]  that russian players denounce their own government and specifically adhere
[3:27:39.960 --> 3:27:44.520]  to this current thing narrative that sounds pretty draconian right but
[3:27:44.520 --> 3:27:47.640]  wimbledon has gone a step further they're saying
[3:27:47.640 --> 3:27:51.800]  even russian and bell russian players that openly denounce
[3:27:51.800 --> 3:27:55.400]  russia's invasion of ukraine openly denounce putin
[3:27:55.400 --> 3:27:58.840]  carry the water for the current thing narrative to a tee
[3:27:58.840 --> 3:28:03.400]  they're banned simply because they were born on a piece of land called russia
[3:28:03.400 --> 3:28:06.920]  or belarus well serbian star jokovic who of
[3:28:06.920 --> 3:28:11.240]  course was deported earlier this year there is refusal to
[3:28:11.240 --> 3:28:15.240]  partake in the then current thing the mass vaccination
[3:28:15.240 --> 3:28:18.840]  has said that it's crazy he said quote i will always condemn war i will never
[3:28:18.840 --> 3:28:22.760]  support war being myself a child of war of course the attack on
[3:28:22.760 --> 3:28:27.080]  Serbia by nato he asserted adding i know how emotional
[3:28:27.080 --> 3:28:30.840]  trauma it leaves in Serbia we all know what happened in 1999
[3:28:30.840 --> 3:28:34.760]  nato attack the country in the Balkans we have had many wars in recent history
[3:28:34.760 --> 3:28:38.440]  however i cannot support the decision of wimbledon i think it's crazy
[3:28:38.440 --> 3:28:42.680]  when politics interferes with sport the result is not good said
[3:28:42.680 --> 3:28:46.360]  jokovic we're going to go on into the next segment and talk about how
[3:28:46.360 --> 3:28:49.320]  Germans are being told to take fewer showers
[3:28:49.320 --> 3:28:53.000]  because of their need to support the current thing we'll be back summit dot
[3:28:53.000 --> 3:28:58.440]  means don't go away ladies and gentlemen i need your help

[3:29:12.280 --> 3:29:15.480]  infrastructure because of the censorship and deplatforming
[3:29:15.480 --> 3:29:19.640]  that cost tens of millions of dollars and now with bandot video getting close to
[3:29:19.640 --> 3:29:23.160]  10 million views a day we're a platform for thousands
[3:29:23.160 --> 3:29:27.560]  of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content

[3:29:37.240 --> 3:29:40.840]  the pro-human liberty movement worldwide but the expenses
[3:29:40.840 --> 3:29:44.120]  in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter

[3:32:07.240 --> 3:32:11.400]  films i wanted to really challenge the globalist and it was a t-shirt i designed

[3:34:00.520 --> 3:34:06.040]  everywhere that i drive around where i live i visit nearby villages
[3:34:06.040 --> 3:34:09.880]  here in england moved out of london of course
[3:34:09.880 --> 3:34:14.920]  to a more rural countryside area every little village you go to they
[3:34:14.920 --> 3:34:19.000]  are expressing support for the current thing
[3:34:19.000 --> 3:34:24.440]  i've been to villages tiny little hamlets with populations of literally
[3:34:24.440 --> 3:34:27.720]  i don't know 50 or 100 people in the village
[3:34:27.720 --> 3:34:30.840]  and everywhere you go outside private houses
[3:34:30.840 --> 3:34:35.640]  on public greens this is like taxpayer funded at this point
[3:34:35.640 --> 3:34:41.560]  giant ukrainian flags everywhere absolutely everywhere and you'll notice
[3:34:41.560 --> 3:34:44.840]  these nice villages that you go to are the most
[3:34:44.840 --> 3:34:48.440]  economically viable villages and little hamlets
[3:34:48.440 --> 3:34:52.360]  in the entire country in many cases so these
[3:34:52.360 --> 3:34:57.880]  very privileged very posh people are vehemently displaying their support for
[3:34:57.880 --> 3:35:01.080]  the current thing meanwhile people in other
[3:35:01.080 --> 3:35:04.680]  areas of the country already close to the poverty line
[3:35:04.680 --> 3:35:10.920]  are basically now slipping into poverty both economic and personal depression
[3:35:10.920 --> 3:35:15.320]  because of soaring gasoline prices soaring food prices
[3:35:15.320 --> 3:35:18.920]  they were obviously already on the rack because of the inflation which we also
[3:35:18.920 --> 3:35:21.880]  had in the uk as you had in the united states
[3:35:21.880 --> 3:35:26.120]  before any of this even started but apparently it's all putin's fault
[3:35:26.120 --> 3:35:30.600]  those people poor people across the country were already on the edge
[3:35:30.600 --> 3:35:33.720]  now as a result of this as a result of these sanctions
[3:35:33.720 --> 3:35:36.920]  they're going to be pushed over the edge we know that poverty
[3:35:36.920 --> 3:35:41.880]  it's not just scrambling around for some money poverty directly leads to death
[3:35:41.880 --> 3:35:46.600]  it leads to depression it leads to cancers so we have people across the
[3:35:46.600 --> 3:35:49.640]  country in these poor areas struggling to get by
[3:35:49.640 --> 3:35:52.680]  struggling to buy food struggling to feed their families
[3:35:52.680 --> 3:35:56.200]  struggling to fill up their vehicles and then you have all these
[3:35:56.200 --> 3:36:01.560]  posh quats everywhere else who have a pile of money that they're sitting on
[3:36:01.560 --> 3:36:06.280]  virtue signalling about supporting the current thing by erecting giant flags
[3:36:06.280 --> 3:36:11.640]  of a country which two months ago they knew nothing whatsoever about
[3:36:11.640 --> 3:36:16.920]  in public and it's absolutely everywhere i mean what they had before i don't know
[3:36:16.920 --> 3:36:21.000]  maybe they had giant nhs flags because the nhs is so good and it's the
[3:36:21.000 --> 3:36:23.960]  envy of the world maybe in a few months i'll have
[3:36:23.960 --> 3:36:28.440]  giant lgbt flags but again i just find it absolutely
[3:36:28.440 --> 3:36:32.360]  unconscionable that people who are already close to the poverty line have
[3:36:32.360 --> 3:36:36.440]  slipped into poverty now they don't have the money
[3:36:36.440 --> 3:36:40.360]  to buy a five-dollar ukrainian flag off of amazon
[3:36:40.360 --> 3:36:45.160]  to hoist it proudly and say i stand with ukraine
[3:36:45.160 --> 3:36:50.440]  absolutely incredible and now we see technocrats elitists in european
[3:36:50.440 --> 3:36:53.560]  countries telling people to suck it up
[3:36:53.560 --> 3:36:59.320]  headline out of summit news germans told to take fewer showers as energy costs
[3:36:59.320 --> 3:37:03.480]  buy and of course they they need to stand with ukraine but that may mean not
[3:37:03.480 --> 3:37:08.120]  putting food on the table or not being able to take a hot shower
[3:37:08.120 --> 3:37:11.720]  they're literally saying in this article which was published by germany's
[3:37:11.720 --> 3:37:15.880]  bill newspaper massive tabloid newspaper in germany
[3:37:15.880 --> 3:37:20.760]  that not having a shower for three weeks makes you smell better
[3:37:20.760 --> 3:37:25.800]  they literally say this in the article the misdiscussion in the country of a
[3:37:25.800 --> 3:37:29.720]  potential total energy embargo on russia
[3:37:29.720 --> 3:37:33.400]  articles about the supposed health benefits of showering less
[3:37:33.400 --> 3:37:37.320]  have begun to pop up and bear in mind we had an article a few weeks ago where
[3:37:37.320 --> 3:37:41.640]  their government minister peter haw also told germans that they should cope
[3:37:41.640 --> 3:37:45.480]  with soaring energy costs by turning off the heating and
[3:37:45.480 --> 3:37:49.640]  wearing warmer sweaters bear in mind this is about six weeks ago
[3:37:49.640 --> 3:37:53.560]  when it was very cold in germany old people die
[3:37:53.560 --> 3:37:57.240]  if they don't have the heating on they're literally saying
[3:37:57.240 --> 3:38:01.160]  it's better to stand for the current thing than to survive
[3:38:01.160 --> 3:38:05.640]  as an old person and get pneumonia and die
[3:38:05.640 --> 3:38:08.760]  the government minister literally came out and said quote
[3:38:08.760 --> 3:38:12.600]  you can withstand 15 degrees celsius in winter in a sweater
[3:38:12.600 --> 3:38:15.640]  no one dies of it but people are dying elsewhere
[3:38:15.640 --> 3:38:19.800]  well then they had to have poverty experts and
[3:38:19.800 --> 3:38:23.000]  heating energy experts come out and say that no
[3:38:23.000 --> 3:38:26.440]  actually old people are very susceptible to
[3:38:26.440 --> 3:38:30.840]  that kind of decrease in temperature and they do get ill very easily
[3:38:30.840 --> 3:38:34.680]  if the temperature in their homes isn't sufficiently high enough so yes they are
[3:38:34.680 --> 3:38:39.480]  dying they do die they can't afford to heat their own homes
[3:38:39.480 --> 3:38:43.640]  but i suppose it's more important to stand with the current thing isn't it
[3:38:43.640 --> 3:38:47.320]  so now they've come out with these bs studies
[3:38:47.320 --> 3:38:54.200]  from experts saying quote it's enough to wash these four body parts
[3:38:54.200 --> 3:38:59.160]  why the skin cleans itself they're telling germans don't shower for three
[3:38:59.160 --> 3:39:01.560]  to four weeks and you'll smell better
[3:39:01.560 --> 3:39:05.560]  they're literally telling them wash your armpits and you're
[3:39:05.560 --> 3:39:11.080]  behind basically which in the united kingdom is colloquially
[3:39:11.080 --> 3:39:15.880]  known as a quote horse wash it's a literal like
[3:39:15.880 --> 3:39:20.200]  19th century term apparently this is what we're going back to now
[3:39:20.200 --> 3:39:23.640]  in terms of the great reset and the deliberate reduction in living
[3:39:23.640 --> 3:39:27.720]  standards which was happening for months and years before any of this
[3:39:27.720 --> 3:39:32.360]  Ukraine crap but now they can smother it in that current thing narrative
[3:39:32.360 --> 3:39:36.360]  and say no it's because of Vladimir Putin that we're reducing your living
[3:39:36.360 --> 3:39:40.200]  standards absolutely incredible let's go to this
[3:39:40.200 --> 3:39:44.120]  sweden clip now though because sweden has seen massive multicultural riots in
[3:39:44.120 --> 3:39:47.480]  the past few days and then the media came out and of course blamed it on
[3:39:47.480 --> 3:39:51.240]  right-wingers here is the clip multicultural riots in
[3:39:51.240 --> 3:39:55.400]  sweden let's roll it multicultural areas of sweden have
[3:39:55.400 --> 3:39:59.560]  been rocked by three nights of some of the worst riots the country has ever
[3:39:59.560 --> 3:40:03.240]  seen the prevailing media narrative holds that the riots were a somewhat
[3:40:03.240 --> 3:40:06.760]  justified response to plans by a right-wing group to burn the
[3:40:06.760 --> 3:40:09.560]  Koran politician rasmus paladin held an event in
[3:40:09.560 --> 3:40:14.440]  jonka ping while brandishing a koran but his speech was drowned out by a priest
[3:40:14.440 --> 3:40:17.320]  ringing the bells of a local church in protest
[3:40:17.320 --> 3:40:21.320]  sweden's liberal churches having done of course absolutely nothing to prevent
[3:40:21.320 --> 3:40:25.320]  the total subversion of christianity aside from openly encouraging
[3:40:25.320 --> 3:40:29.880]  it ever eager to exploit an opportunity to riot the diverse populations of
[3:40:29.880 --> 3:40:33.480]  rinkabee or ebro and last night malmo took to the
[3:40:33.480 --> 3:40:36.920]  streets to cause mayhem authorities told the associated
[3:40:36.920 --> 3:40:41.720]  press the criminal rioters are just using paladins karanston as an excuse
[3:40:41.720 --> 3:40:44.440]  and that their real target has been the police
[3:40:44.440 --> 3:40:48.760]  sweden's national police chief and as thornberg says he's never seen such
[3:40:48.760 --> 3:40:53.160]  violent riots quite the statement given the country is routinely rocked by
[3:40:53.160 --> 3:40:56.760]  mass civil unrest thanks to its open door immigration policy
[3:40:56.760 --> 3:40:59.800]  the situation is so notorious that last month
[3:40:59.800 --> 3:41:03.720]  ukrainian refugees said they'd rather stay home in a war zone
[3:41:03.720 --> 3:41:07.720]  than be fed into the swedish asylum system sweden went from being one of the
[3:41:07.720 --> 3:41:12.120]  safest countries in europe 20 years ago to the second most dangerous
[3:41:12.120 --> 3:41:15.240]  gee i wonder what changed we know what changed
[3:41:15.240 --> 3:41:20.280]  the people living there remember back in 2017 when the media laughed at trump for
[3:41:20.280 --> 3:41:24.840]  highlighting sweden's massive problem with unintegrated muslim migrants
[3:41:24.840 --> 3:41:29.320]  they also tried to run hit pieces on me asserting that dangerous migrant crime
[3:41:29.320 --> 3:41:32.440]  no-go zones were a made-up conspiracy theory
[3:41:32.440 --> 3:41:37.400]  yeah well it's not so funny now is it the same no-go zones they once insisted
[3:41:37.400 --> 3:41:42.600]  didn't exist and now routinely on fire as even left-wing journalist
[3:41:42.600 --> 3:41:51.480]  lina melin admitted back in 2019 quote everyone knew it would end in disaster
[3:41:51.480 --> 3:41:56.360]  so sweden routinely suffers these migrant riots mainly for the reason that police
[3:41:56.360 --> 3:42:00.920]  try to arrest violent criminals and then they'll riot in response to it
[3:42:00.920 --> 3:42:05.320]  it's happened in 2020 it's happened numerous times before that it happened
[3:42:05.320 --> 3:42:08.920]  in 2017 which is when trump came out and talked about it and they all tried to
[3:42:08.920 --> 3:42:12.600]  humiliate him and basically pretend it wasn't happening
[3:42:12.600 --> 3:42:16.520]  so you had that happen again the police the authorities say
[3:42:16.520 --> 3:42:21.880]  it's not the right wingers burning the quran it's not them rioting it's these
[3:42:21.880 --> 3:42:27.000]  muslim migrant criminal youth gangs using that as an excuse to deliberately
[3:42:27.000 --> 3:42:31.320]  target the police even the politically correct police in sweden are saying that
[3:42:31.320 --> 3:42:35.320]  but how did the german media respond well they said that these riots these car
[3:42:35.320 --> 3:42:39.560]  burnings these throwing stones at police officers were actually staged by
[3:42:39.560 --> 3:42:44.120]  shadowy right wing extremists cdf reported that there were quote
[3:42:44.120 --> 3:42:49.080]  riots at right wing demos in malmo of course the riots were conducted by the
[3:42:49.080 --> 3:42:52.680]  muslim migrants not anyone on the right wing we'll be back some of the news
[3:42:52.680 --> 3:42:55.160]  don't go away

[3:48:49.960 --> 3:48:53.800]  expose her for war all she does is post videos of leftists
[3:48:53.800 --> 3:48:58.840]  innately ranting on tiktok if your ideology is so progressive tolerant
[3:48:58.840 --> 3:49:03.800]  and wise why is it necessary to weaponize a huge legacy media outlet owned
[3:49:03.800 --> 3:49:07.240]  by a literal billionaire to target someone merely for
[3:49:07.240 --> 3:49:11.800]  amplifying that ideology quote several teachers have been fired as a result of
[3:49:11.800 --> 3:49:14.920]  being featured on the account but wait according to you lot
[3:49:14.920 --> 3:49:17.960]  cancel culture doesn't exist according to them
[3:49:17.960 --> 3:49:21.320]  whenever the mob gets a conservative fired it's just
[3:49:21.320 --> 3:49:25.560]  taking responsibility for their words and actions how is that any different
[3:49:25.560 --> 3:49:30.360]  from the role performed by libs of tiktok no it's not okay when you do it
[3:49:30.360 --> 3:49:34.280]  taylor lorenz is about to expose the private citizen behind some anonymous
[3:49:34.280 --> 3:49:37.560]  account on twitter and when people criticize her for it she and her friends
[3:49:37.560 --> 3:49:40.280]  will claim taylor is the real victim and anyone
[3:49:40.280 --> 3:49:44.280]  criticizing this type of journalism will be guilty of causing her trauma
[3:49:44.280 --> 3:49:47.640]  only the narcissists in corporate media could take someone who grew up in
[3:49:47.640 --> 3:49:50.520]  grenich wealth and swiss boarding schools who regularly
[3:49:50.520 --> 3:49:54.360]  harms the lives of ordinary citizens with their massive journalistic platform
[3:49:54.360 --> 3:49:58.040]  and tell the public she's the victim and can't be criticized
[3:49:58.040 --> 3:50:00.920]  this is the framework corporate journalists are trying to construct and
[3:50:00.920 --> 3:50:04.600]  force you to accept they can criticize expose bully and destroy
[3:50:04.600 --> 3:50:10.040]  anyone they want no limits their journalists you can't criticize how
[3:50:10.040 --> 3:50:14.840]  they use their power that's harassment lorenz then literally showed up on the
[3:50:14.840 --> 3:50:19.720]  doorstep of libs of tiktoks relatives to harass them this from the woman who
[3:50:19.720 --> 3:50:29.000]  cried on tv about harassment this from the woman who literally tweeted quote
[3:50:29.000 --> 3:50:33.240]  doxing stalking trying to hurt and smear people's loved ones threatening them
[3:50:33.240 --> 3:50:37.640]  it's not okay in any situation but it's okay when we do it it's okay when it's
[3:50:37.640 --> 3:50:42.120]  being published in a billionaire owned corporate media giant taylor lorenz
[3:50:42.120 --> 3:50:44.760]  mean tweets taylor lorenz showing up to people's
[3:50:44.760 --> 3:50:47.560]  homes and calling their family because of an a non twitter account
[3:50:47.560 --> 3:50:51.720]  virtually the entire article that lorenz then published in the washington post
[3:50:51.720 --> 3:50:56.360]  exposing libs of tiktoks name and location is just whining about how
[3:50:56.360 --> 3:51:00.200]  effective the account has been in derailing the groomer agenda
[3:51:00.200 --> 3:51:03.720]  oh but it's to protect the alphabet people who are apparently so
[3:51:03.720 --> 3:51:08.440]  downtrodden they require anyone who makes fun of them to be made an example
[3:51:08.440 --> 3:51:11.560]  of by one of the most powerful institutions in america
[3:51:11.560 --> 3:51:15.240]  oh my god so downtrodden lorenz's previous greatest hits include
[3:51:15.240 --> 3:51:19.400]  exposing the identities of pamela gellar's young daughters who weren't
[3:51:19.400 --> 3:51:23.400]  even political and who had been previously targeted along with geller
[3:51:23.400 --> 3:51:27.240]  herself by islamic terrorists but remember
[3:51:27.240 --> 3:51:33.080]  taylor lorenz is the real victim it's really hard
[3:51:33.080 --> 3:51:36.680]  and well what do you know after this controversy blew up yesterday
[3:51:36.680 --> 3:51:41.560]  guess who claimed to be the victim once again it was taylor lorenz
[3:51:41.560 --> 3:51:45.720]  matt taibian zero hedge has got a good article about this called the washington
[3:51:45.720 --> 3:51:51.480]  post libs of tiktok nothinburger he makes the argument that this ambush
[3:51:51.480 --> 3:51:55.000]  journalism this showing up on the doorsteps of people confronting them
[3:51:55.000 --> 3:51:59.240]  with cameras in the streets is only really permissible from a
[3:51:59.240 --> 3:52:03.640]  journalistic epic standpoint if you're confronting people who have been
[3:52:03.640 --> 3:52:08.920]  accused of serious corruption project veritas has done that in the past
[3:52:08.920 --> 3:52:11.880]  left-wing organizations have done it in the past
[3:52:11.880 --> 3:52:17.640]  this woman her sins run to running a tiktok running a twitter account sorry
[3:52:17.640 --> 3:52:22.840]  that highlights demented deranged rants that left this post on tiktok
[3:52:22.840 --> 3:52:27.480]  which go viral on tiktok in many cases and merely highlighting
[3:52:27.480 --> 3:52:32.200]  their words she's a private citizen she's not accused of any corruption
[3:52:32.200 --> 3:52:36.040]  the main gripe the main beef that taylor lorenz and these
[3:52:36.040 --> 3:52:39.560]  leftists have with her and that account is as ever
[3:52:39.560 --> 3:52:43.080]  that it's effective in exposing them for exactly
[3:52:43.080 --> 3:52:48.520]  what they are groomers let's go to this other clip now though because we had
[3:52:48.520 --> 3:52:52.520]  an absolutely hilarious development a couple of days ago
[3:52:52.520 --> 3:52:58.520]  where the youtuber Ethan Klein who was repeatedly called for the de-platforming
[3:52:58.520 --> 3:53:03.560]  of other youtubers repeatedly said that cancel culture is a good thing
[3:53:03.560 --> 3:53:07.560]  lo and behold guess what happened to him he got cancelled
[3:53:07.560 --> 3:53:10.040]  remember this is the guy who had a spat with
[3:53:10.040 --> 3:53:15.480]  jordan peterson back in january where he said the canadian academic was quote a
[3:53:15.480 --> 3:53:18.760]  dangerous gateway to the alt-right transphobia and
[3:53:18.760 --> 3:53:22.680]  covid miss info so ethan kline deleted these two
[3:53:22.680 --> 3:53:26.680]  interviews with jordan peterson which at the time a few years back
[3:53:26.680 --> 3:53:30.680]  were very entertaining very friendly interviews
[3:53:30.680 --> 3:53:34.600]  but again because ethan kline has basically sold his soul to the
[3:53:34.600 --> 3:53:39.720]  devil in terms of susan wajiki and youtube he's joined the regime and of
[3:53:39.720 --> 3:53:43.240]  course part of joining the regime means that you need to denounce all your
[3:53:43.240 --> 3:53:46.680]  previous beliefs and all the previous people you
[3:53:46.680 --> 3:53:50.840]  were associated with he deleted the two
[3:53:50.840 --> 3:53:54.440]  jordan peterson interviews that he had uploaded several years previously
[3:53:54.440 --> 3:53:57.800]  again because he's so petrified pathetically
[3:53:57.800 --> 3:54:01.800]  of the mob coming to cancel him well of course when he deleted those
[3:54:01.800 --> 3:54:06.040]  interviews jordan peterson warned him directly he said quote
[3:54:06.040 --> 3:54:09.080]  you will be held to a higher and higher and soon impossible to maintain
[3:54:09.080 --> 3:54:12.520]  ethical standards by the very mob you wish to please
[3:54:12.520 --> 3:54:15.960]  then you will make a mistake and they will devour you with glee
[3:54:15.960 --> 3:54:20.600]  please take this warning seriously ethan kline responded by saying
[3:54:20.600 --> 3:54:24.120]  cancelling as you call it sometimes is a good experience well
[3:54:24.120 --> 3:54:27.160]  he knows that feeling for sure now because he
[3:54:27.160 --> 3:54:31.960]  has been cancelled let's go to the clip here it is
[3:54:31.960 --> 3:54:37.960]  this isn't too far it's too much sorry gary stands
[3:54:37.960 --> 3:54:43.240]  today we have no sponsors because uh
[3:54:43.240 --> 3:54:48.040]  i am an existential threat to gay rights
[3:54:48.040 --> 3:54:53.240]  and all progress so of course our wonderful
[3:54:53.240 --> 3:54:57.560]  fans have taken upon themselves to rid of our sponsors
[3:54:57.560 --> 3:55:03.480]  and to have them uh can't uh not sponsor or not to
[3:55:03.480 --> 3:55:11.560]  support us so we are um i'm very you know
[3:55:11.560 --> 3:55:15.640]  i'll just say this it's a i'm very thankful to our members
[3:55:15.640 --> 3:55:22.040]  it makes this show kind of uh bulletproof to stuff like this even
[3:55:22.040 --> 3:55:25.560]  though it's painful and emotionally it just doesn't it's
[3:55:25.560 --> 3:55:30.040]  just painful that you know people would do that
[3:55:30.040 --> 3:55:33.000]  there it is and you know the other thing is like you
[3:55:33.000 --> 3:55:38.280]  you like you expect a little more of the sponsors in a way but i get it
[3:55:38.280 --> 3:55:42.520]  there is you know it's just transactional for them but you know i feel like i
[3:55:42.520 --> 3:55:46.920]  put so much into the good our good partners and
[3:55:46.920 --> 3:55:50.280]  it's kind of crazy when they just drop you like a bag of their one over some
[3:55:50.280 --> 3:55:54.600]  bull so again that was him being cancelled
[3:55:54.600 --> 3:55:58.280]  after saying cancel culture was a good thing because he made quote
[3:55:58.280 --> 3:56:03.160]  homophobic remarks in a separate clip which basically you know was just
[3:56:03.160 --> 3:56:06.600]  bantering so now the same person that celebrate at
[3:56:06.600 --> 3:56:10.280]  other people being the platform saying cancel culture was a good thing
[3:56:10.280 --> 3:56:13.960]  Jordan Peterson three months ago directly warns him
[3:56:13.960 --> 3:56:18.120]  you will be cancelled by the same mob and lo and behold he's cancelled
[3:56:18.120 --> 3:56:22.920]  he's lost all his sponsors couldn't have happened to a nice person
[3:56:22.920 --> 3:56:27.480]  meanwhile family sex show aimed at kids cancelled after backlash groomers take
[3:56:27.480 --> 3:56:30.520]  the ale this was a disgusting production which
[3:56:30.520 --> 3:56:35.240]  involved naked performers in the united kingdom at
[3:56:35.240 --> 3:56:39.640]  Bristol's tobacco factory called the family sex show
[3:56:39.640 --> 3:56:43.160]  and the production company behind this themselves called it quote
[3:56:43.160 --> 3:56:47.640]  an alternative to porn now that has been cancelled after thousands of people
[3:56:47.640 --> 3:56:53.560]  signed a petition opposing it so again the left says cancel culture doesn't
[3:56:53.560 --> 3:56:57.080]  exist but when it happens to them suddenly it
[3:56:57.080 --> 3:57:00.440]  does exist if you're trying to cancel literal groomers
[3:57:00.440 --> 3:57:04.120]  and it's a bad thing meanwhile black americans murdered
[3:57:04.120 --> 3:57:10.120]  jumps 32% thanks to black lives matter so 2020 murder of black people jumped
[3:57:10.120 --> 3:57:14.360]  32% and of course the reason is the Ferguson effect
[3:57:14.360 --> 3:57:18.440]  defund the police movement promulgated by black lives matter
[3:57:18.440 --> 3:57:22.440]  has caused police officers not to enter high crime areas
[3:57:22.440 --> 3:57:25.560]  which results in more black people being killed
[3:57:25.560 --> 3:57:30.440]  another rip roaring success for black lives matter which now exists basically
[3:57:30.440 --> 3:57:34.840]  as a giant grift operation for its founders to buy multimillion dollar
[3:57:34.840 --> 3:57:37.480]  mansions that's going to wrap it up warram is coming

[3:59:23.800 --> 3:59:26.920]  knowing our bearings and then claus Schwab recently came out and gave
[3:59:26.920 --> 3:59:31.240]  speech he called the great new narrative where he brags how the public is lost
[3:59:31.240 --> 3:59:35.240]  how the culture in the media has been driven to make sure the people are all
[3:59:35.240 --> 3:59:37.720]  alone so they can now guide humanity over the
[3:59:37.720 --> 3:59:40.520]  edge of a cliff that's what the great reset is
