[00:00:05.464 --> 00:00:10.288]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.288 --> 00:00:11.889]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.430]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.633]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:21.676]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.927 --> 00:00:36.848]  I didn't do a Sunday show yesterday.
[00:00:36.848 --> 00:00:43.531]  Took it off for Ishtar Day with the family.
[00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:45.452]  And it feels like I had a month off.
[00:00:45.452 --> 00:00:48.994]  Very, very relaxing to actually have two full days off.
[00:00:48.994 --> 00:00:52.996]  I didn't do any work Saturday or Sunday.
[00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:55.129]  Well, that's not really true.
[00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.032]  I only did four or five hours of research Saturday night and Sunday night, but I don't really call that work.
[00:01:01.032 --> 00:01:03.252]  So, I am focused.
[00:01:03.252 --> 00:01:06.614]  I have a ton of news and information to cover today.
[00:01:06.614 --> 00:01:08.414]  Very important broadcast.
[00:01:08.414 --> 00:01:18.178]  Just tons of just amazingly important news and information coming up in the next four hours.
[00:01:19.755 --> 00:01:22.837]  We have now gotten a federal report.
[00:01:22.837 --> 00:01:26.659]  This was going around the internet Saturday night.
[00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.662]  Kurt Nemo did a story on it at Infowars.com last night.
[00:01:32.662 --> 00:01:40.826]  And I got home from my parents at about nine o'clock and I said, you know, why don't I just call the FBI phone number here?
[00:01:40.826 --> 00:01:47.250]  And I did call and confirm that it is another MIAC report, but it's a federal master report.
[00:01:48.217 --> 00:01:53.040]  Which is what the state reports are copied from.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.604]  And the headline is, Secret Department of Homeland Security document predicts violence in response to new gun restrictions.
[00:02:00.604 --> 00:02:06.247]  It goes on to say that Americans buying guns and ammo are terrorists.
[00:02:06.247 --> 00:02:17.934]  It says that this is the number one threat to law enforcement, that it's terrorists that are buying the ammo and guns, and that it's terrorism, and that new gun restriction laws are going to cause a revolt in the country.
[00:02:20.822 --> 00:02:25.826]  And so law enforcement is gearing up to deal with that.
[00:02:25.826 --> 00:02:32.911]  So we're going to be covering that here on the show today.
[00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:33.312]  Also,
[00:02:35.023 --> 00:02:48.387]  I noticed, when I was in the comment sections of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, I saw an audio clip of another Genesis radio show, and of course the regular accusations, why are you covering this up, Alex?
[00:02:48.387 --> 00:02:50.287]  Well, because I didn't know about it.
[00:02:50.287 --> 00:02:53.388]  That's why I was covering it up.
[00:02:53.388 --> 00:02:56.149]  Because I didn't know about it, you posted it and let me know!
[00:02:56.149 --> 00:03:01.250]  That I guess last week or something, Joyce Raleigh had a caller to her show on the Power Hour,
[00:03:02.551 --> 00:03:04.931]  It's one of the mornings here on Genesis Network.
[00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:18.394]  And the caller began hyperventilating and talking about trucks going into underground silos and being loaded with something iced up and how the guys are paid cash and they go to the back of Bank of America.
[00:03:18.394 --> 00:03:26.816]  I will tell you this, folks, it's no reflection on the Fine Radio Show, that this report is a load of bull.
[00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:28.850]  I mean, I will tell you that.
[00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.073]  I mean, I understand this stuff.
[00:03:31.073 --> 00:03:42.548]  The minute I saw Linda Thompson's video of the train station 14 years ago in Illinois, the Amtrak station, I knew it was baloney.
[00:03:42.548 --> 00:03:44.330]  The minute I saw the colorized
[00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.760]  CS gas being sprayed out and they just painted it orange on the tank.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.320]  I said it was fake.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:58.201]  I told you what Glenn Beck was going to be saying and doing in his hit piece.
[00:03:58.201 --> 00:04:01.342]  Look, I know what I'm talking about, okay?
[00:04:01.342 --> 00:04:03.822]  And I'm telling you.
[00:04:03.822 --> 00:04:13.844]  So, it's a big hysteria going on on the internet right now with this lady's phone call to a Genesis Radio show
[00:04:16.394 --> 00:04:20.896]  The only way it's real is the feds are trying to create a freakout.
[00:04:20.896 --> 00:04:21.776]  Oh, it doesn't even matter.
[00:04:21.776 --> 00:04:22.657]  People won't listen to me.
[00:04:22.657 --> 00:04:23.597]  It just doesn't matter.
[00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:24.918]  It doesn't matter.
[00:04:24.918 --> 00:04:33.422]  People like to chase a million vapors instead of the real meat and potatoes information.
[00:04:33.422 --> 00:04:38.804]  So I'm going to break that down as well.
[00:04:38.804 --> 00:04:42.966]  But what's really going on with the bird flu, the weaponized bird flu,
[00:04:44.335 --> 00:04:46.036]  That's coming up today as well.
[00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.356]  It's just a totally jam-packed transmission.
[00:04:48.356 --> 00:04:50.137]  Naomi Wolf.
[00:04:50.137 --> 00:04:50.817]  She's going to be on.
[00:04:50.817 --> 00:04:52.898]  I'm going to ask her about Lord Obama.
[00:04:52.898 --> 00:04:54.839]  Is he now already worse than Bush?
[00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:57.520]  The Rhodes Scholar joins us.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.541]  And then we got Joe Bannister, former Treasury agent.
[00:05:01.443 --> 00:05:02.344]  Attention, gardeners!
[00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:04.945]  This is an urgent GCN Self-Reliance Update.
[00:05:04.945 --> 00:05:09.468]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[00:05:09.468 --> 00:05:17.673]  It's called Proto-Grow, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[00:05:17.673 --> 00:05:20.495]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:28.401]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[00:05:28.401 --> 00:05:34.242]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[00:05:34.242 --> 00:05:40.063]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste, enough to ten times the nutritional value.
[00:05:40.063 --> 00:05:43.304]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[00:05:43.624 --> 00:05:47.206]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[00:05:47.206 --> 00:05:52.268]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirt Chief superfoods should visit the ProtoGro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:55.189]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.490]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.351]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:13.857]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.857 --> 00:06:20.301]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:22.342]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:22.342 --> 00:06:24.804]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:06:24.804 --> 00:06:35.691]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:39.642]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:39.642 --> 00:06:41.504]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:41.504 --> 00:06:48.429]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:48.429 --> 00:06:56.696]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:56.696 --> 00:06:58.257]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:58.257 --> 00:06:59.458]  The people strike back.
[00:07:01.232 --> 00:07:09.496]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:07:09.496 --> 00:07:14.059]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:18.721]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:07:18.721 --> 00:07:20.142]  It's a documented fact.
[00:07:21.002 --> 00:07:27.766]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:07:27.766 --> 00:07:39.874]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.
[00:07:39.874 --> 00:07:43.536]  FPP is now available to you from FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[00:07:44.136 --> 00:07:47.279]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:51.023]  FPP is so affordable, you can't afford to do without.
[00:07:51.023 --> 00:07:54.506]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:54.766]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:55.047]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.031]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.031 --> 00:08:10.791]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:12.371]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.371 --> 00:08:13.292]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.292 --> 00:08:18.113]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.113 --> 00:08:22.154]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:39.732 --> 00:08:42.294]  Folks, you talk about information overload.
[00:08:42.294 --> 00:08:54.944]  During the last three-minute break, I'm just sitting here going through two gigantic stacks of news, every story vitally important to the future of humanity, liberty, and freedom.
[00:08:56.087 --> 00:08:59.728]  I have this long list of different points and ideas and information.
[00:08:59.728 --> 00:09:09.171]  I wanted to go over watching the news, reading the news this weekend, chomping at the bit to be live here Monday morning.
[00:09:09.171 --> 00:09:12.752]  Let me just go ahead and list some of the things I've got here in front of me.
[00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:19.974]  The Mexican government, the Mexican president, the Mexican ambassador to Washington are all over the news saying
[00:09:21.075 --> 00:09:39.060]  Ban assault weapons, reauthorize the assault weapons ban, but Obama's new version would actually register Americans, psychologically test Americans, and physically ban the ownership of semi-automatic handguns and rifles.
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:48.743]  And here is a foreign government that has a total gun ban in their nation, except for their police and military, which has the highest crime rate of any country in the world,
[00:09:49.502 --> 00:09:52.524]  Where 6,000 plus people died last year.
[00:09:52.524 --> 00:09:58.007]  They're on line for more than 10,000 to die this year, if the trend continues.
[00:09:58.007 --> 00:10:02.130]  Thousands and thousands dead in the first few months of 2009.
[00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.591]  And here they are!
[00:10:03.591 --> 00:10:05.552]  Total gun ban for their citizens.
[00:10:05.552 --> 00:10:09.014]  The criminals in government, in uniform, feed on the public.
[00:10:09.014 --> 00:10:13.697]  I have been shaken down repeatedly by Mexican police and troops.
[00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:14.117]  I have!
[00:10:16.058 --> 00:10:20.620]  The last time it happened, I thought, why do I come to this country?
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.480]  No more!
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.641]  I'm never going back to Mexico again.
[00:10:23.641 --> 00:10:28.083]  I'm done being sucked on by a parasite country of criminals.
[00:10:28.083 --> 00:10:28.944]  Done.
[00:10:28.944 --> 00:10:30.684]  Finished.
[00:10:30.684 --> 00:10:32.225]  America should boycott.
[00:10:32.225 --> 00:10:33.746]  The country may be bringing the U.S.
[00:10:33.746 --> 00:10:33.986]  down.
[00:10:33.986 --> 00:10:35.446]  It may be overrunning the United States.
[00:10:35.446 --> 00:10:42.910]  Our traitorous federal government may love the fact they've broken the backs of the American people on our wages and everything's in free fall and bankrupt of the states.
[00:10:44.031 --> 00:10:45.832]  The 30 million illegal aliens?
[00:10:45.832 --> 00:10:48.353]  Man, they may have introduced total amnesty bills again.
[00:10:48.353 --> 00:10:51.154]  And they may think they've killed this country dead in a hammer.
[00:10:51.154 --> 00:10:55.715]  But I'm telling you, I'm not buying anything made in Mexico, and I'm never going back to Mexico again.
[00:10:55.715 --> 00:10:57.636]  Let me just say that right now.
[00:10:57.636 --> 00:11:12.902]  That criminal, narco-terrorist state government, down there, says we gotta turn our guns in, and our Attorney General runs around giving press conferences saying absolutely, and now Obama is set to go to Mexico this week and call for amnesty?
[00:11:14.381 --> 00:11:17.582]  Open borders and banning our guns.
[00:11:17.582 --> 00:11:20.003]  This is disgusting.
[00:11:20.003 --> 00:11:30.447]  Our government is so illegitimate, so criminal, it uses a country of 100 million slaves with its criminal leaders as a weapon to beat this country into submission.
[00:11:30.447 --> 00:11:35.189]  We're a broke-back country, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:35.189 --> 00:11:38.290]  So, that's one of the things in my stack.
[00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:39.511]  Then I've got another one here.
[00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:40.131]  Bird flu.
[00:11:41.243 --> 00:11:50.090]  There's all these incredible admissions of just ultra-massive people dying, being injected with live bird flu shots.
[00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.752]  Bird flu in 18 countries mixed with the vaccines.
[00:11:52.752 --> 00:11:54.774]  The vaccines being shipped out.
[00:11:54.774 --> 00:11:57.616]  Nobody cares!
[00:11:57.616 --> 00:12:00.759]  All the conspiracy theory, gossip sites don't cover it.
[00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:01.980]  They don't discuss it.
[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:08.585]  They don't touch it when it's in the Toronto Star and Reuters and Der Spiegel and Bloomberg and right here on this radio show.
[00:12:09.983 --> 00:12:11.263]  Forget that!
[00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:13.024]  Forget discussing that!
[00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:20.747]  Weaponized bird flu mixed with regular human flu.
[00:12:20.747 --> 00:12:22.207]  The media won't investigate it.
[00:12:22.207 --> 00:12:23.587]  No one discusses it.
[00:12:23.587 --> 00:12:29.429]  It's admitted out in the open for the last month.
[00:12:29.429 --> 00:12:31.630]  Nobody wants to touch it because it's real.
[00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.151]  Just like the civilian inmate labor camp programs are real.
[00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.071]  And all the documents are real.
[00:12:37.071 --> 00:12:37.992]  Oh, I don't want to touch that.
[00:12:37.992 --> 00:12:45.117]  I want to go out and videotape a, uh, supply company's, you know, back 40 and say it's a camp.
[00:12:45.117 --> 00:12:48.520]  So Glenn Beck can go point a camera at it and say it's fake.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.120]  I don't understand it.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.783]  It's like it's mass mental illness or something.
[00:12:52.783 --> 00:12:56.586]  You got the government lying, spinning, engaging in every form of corruption, and then you have
[00:12:59.039 --> 00:13:00.319]  I mean, I've seen it a million times.
[00:13:00.319 --> 00:13:02.020]  I've seen it once.
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.460]  People love to obsess on what can't be proven or what's nebulous.
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:13.322]  And I guess it's like a whodunit or something, a mystery theater on PBS brought to you by ExxonMobil or something.
[00:13:13.322 --> 00:13:16.803]  I don't know.
[00:13:16.803 --> 00:13:22.544]  But, you know, I suddenly get all these emails Saturday night because I didn't do any research Saturday.
[00:13:22.544 --> 00:13:28.165]  I spent all day with my children playing in the backyard and playing in the sandbox and playing with cars on the floor.
[00:13:29.181 --> 00:13:30.962]  All sorts of evil things like that.
[00:13:30.962 --> 00:13:35.726]  And I finally go in and open my email up and it's like, YOU'RE COVERING UP THE BIRD FLU!
[00:13:35.726 --> 00:13:39.529]  WHY AREN'T YOU COVERING THIS?!
[00:13:39.529 --> 00:13:45.653]  Then I go to InfoWars.com, read the comments, YOU'RE COVERING IT UP!
[00:13:45.653 --> 00:13:48.636]  Spamming every, you know, page.
[00:13:48.636 --> 00:13:50.757]  And I'm like, okay, let me look at it.
[00:13:50.757 --> 00:13:53.139]  So I sit there.
[00:13:53.139 --> 00:13:56.201]  And I listen to it.
[00:13:56.201 --> 00:13:58.283]  And it's a caller to a Genesis Radio show.
[00:14:00.558 --> 00:14:06.239]  And no blame on the fine talk show host.
[00:14:06.239 --> 00:14:08.760]  And I just wish that caller called me so I could challenge him.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:16.542]  In fact, if you're that lady calling from New York, freaking out, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:14:16.542 --> 00:14:23.163]  We don't have open phones right now, but if you want to call in, because I got some questions for you.
[00:14:23.163 --> 00:14:27.684]  Anyways, this lady calls in, and she says, she says,
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:59.355]  Oh my gosh, there's this truck driver, he's Spanish, and he gets taken down in these silos, and he gets given an injection, he's told for the safety of his family, and then it's all iced, and it's taken, and it's delivered, and it goes all over the place to Homeland Security, and here's the addresses of the, and the Health Department, and they tell him, here's your number, and he goes to a back room at Bank of America, and they pay him in cash, and it's all secret, and you listen to it, and I just know what's real, and I know what's not, and I know this is bull.
[00:15:00.896 --> 00:15:10.804]  And I consider and play it and analyze it and go over it, but maybe I will.
[00:15:10.804 --> 00:15:17.589]  Point by point by point.
[00:15:17.589 --> 00:15:23.213]  Meanwhile, look at these headlines.
[00:15:23.213 --> 00:15:26.896]  Homeless people die after bird flu vaccine trial in Poland.
[00:15:26.896 --> 00:15:27.517]  London Telegraph.
[00:15:28.413 --> 00:15:30.114]  Here's French News Agency.
[00:15:30.114 --> 00:15:33.296]  Health workers on trial for vaccine scam in Poland.
[00:15:33.296 --> 00:15:36.418]  They told over 200 patients that it was just a regular flu shot.
[00:15:36.418 --> 00:15:39.820]  They gave it to them and 23 of them died.
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:50.186]  And the big issue is the media won't say what pharmaceutical company paid the local homeless shelters to lie and give them a shot, but it was live bird flu.
[00:15:50.186 --> 00:15:53.428]  Now that's your issue, folks, because that's where it will mutate in the body.
[00:15:53.428 --> 00:15:57.131]  It's mixed in with a whole bunch of different strains of human
[00:15:59.609 --> 00:16:00.909]  And it's injected into the body.
[00:16:00.909 --> 00:16:04.790]  That's how it mutates and creates an airborne super weaponized.
[00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.571]  It's already weaponized bird flu, but super weaponized.
[00:16:07.571 --> 00:16:09.272]  See, these are the articles.
[00:16:09.272 --> 00:16:12.913]  Nobody wants to make viral videos about this.
[00:16:12.913 --> 00:16:22.277]  Nobody wants to freak out about Baxter Pharmaceutical that was also involved shipping out with Bayer Pharmaceutical, the millions of ampoules of Factor VIII filled with HIV.
[00:16:23.789 --> 00:16:32.875]  And Hepatitis A, B, and C that admittedly killed hundreds of thousands in Maine and millions total got it and are dying now.
[00:16:32.875 --> 00:16:40.259]  I mean, there you got absolutely confirmed, shipping out HIV filled inoculations.
[00:16:40.259 --> 00:16:47.604]  It's actually a blood thickening drug, platelet drug, but it's made by a vaccine maker.
[00:16:50.492 --> 00:16:52.074]  No discussions of that.
[00:16:52.074 --> 00:16:53.275]  No obsessions on that.
[00:16:53.275 --> 00:16:54.416]  No hyperventilating.
[00:16:54.416 --> 00:17:00.043]  You know why I'm successful in reaching people on this radio show?
[00:17:00.043 --> 00:17:02.385]  My hyperventilating isn't the reason I'm successful.
[00:17:02.385 --> 00:17:04.347]  My freakouts aren't the reason I'm successful.
[00:17:04.347 --> 00:17:08.452]  No, it's because we at least cover what can be proven.
[00:17:11.493 --> 00:17:28.780]  You know, I don't put up... You know, when they put up images a year and a half ago of fake Amero coins, you could go look, you could go see it was just a private little mint putting out some joke coins, making fun of the North American Union, showing that it was tyrannical, but people put it out that it was real North American Union coins!
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:33.802]  And so the national media can show that and say it's a hoax, and say it isn't real!
[00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:46.228]  Meanwhile, we got the SPP documents saying North American Union, and the CFR documents, and press conferences with Bush and Barroso and the rest of them, and Merkel, but nobody wants to focus on what's real!
[00:17:46.228 --> 00:17:56.493]  Instead, it's on those stupid fake coins!
[00:17:56.493 --> 00:17:57.354]  The government, um,
[00:17:58.968 --> 00:17:59.669]  Let me just tell you something.
[00:17:59.669 --> 00:18:03.797]  If they're shipping around in trucks a deadly bioweapon, which there's no proof of that.
[00:18:03.797 --> 00:18:06.521]  The person's just saying that's what it is.
[00:18:06.521 --> 00:18:07.603]  If they're shipping that around...
[00:18:09.636 --> 00:18:20.559]  They don't call some regular trucker and tell them what it is and then say, oh, here's a shot and here's $15,000 or $5,000 a load and we pay you in cash.
[00:18:20.559 --> 00:18:28.201]  And the truck driver's running around showing the FBI his $100,000 he's been paid in the last few weeks.
[00:18:28.201 --> 00:18:32.022]  But the feds say it's okay and they're his friend and he's been moved to a safe house.
[00:18:32.022 --> 00:18:35.282]  I mean, what the?
[00:18:35.282 --> 00:18:37.103]  I mean, it's just obvious total bull.
[00:18:41.198 --> 00:18:49.085]  Instead of, Baxter Pharmaceutical knowingly shipping all of this stuff out.
[00:18:49.085 --> 00:18:51.568]  Shipping it out to countries.
[00:18:51.568 --> 00:18:54.190]  There's all these bird flu vaccine trials.
[00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:57.673]  People are dropping dead all over Europe.
[00:18:57.673 --> 00:19:00.256]  They won't say if it's Baxter or who it is.
[00:19:00.256 --> 00:19:06.141]  These are companies with a history of knowingly shipping out millions of dosages of Factor VIII like Bayer.
[00:19:06.141 --> 00:19:06.922]  Working with Baxter.
[00:19:09.281 --> 00:19:13.803]  Baxter is tied into the military industrial complex and black ops.
[00:19:13.803 --> 00:19:15.083]  That's real!
[00:19:15.083 --> 00:19:22.486]  London Telegraph, French News Agency, Toronto Star.
[00:19:22.486 --> 00:19:29.308]  I'll tell you later... Oh God, help me.
[00:19:29.308 --> 00:19:32.229]  So I'm going to break that down more later.
[00:19:32.229 --> 00:19:37.491]  It's very painful to listen to and I listened to it again last night and I... Oh God.
[00:19:42.076 --> 00:19:45.338]  Because this is the type of craziness that discredits what we're doing.
[00:19:45.338 --> 00:19:57.167]  Now, I can't blame people out there for believing it, because we have a track record of a government that's been declassified thousands of times, that takes little foster children, straps them down and radiates them to death.
[00:19:57.167 --> 00:19:58.908]  Or injects them with nerve gas.
[00:19:58.908 --> 00:19:59.729]  Nerve, nerve agent.
[00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:07.806]  With our economy spiraling out of control, living in the soup kitchens may be right around the corner.
[00:20:07.806 --> 00:20:10.828]  No one saw the financial collapse of 1929.
[00:20:10.828 --> 00:20:16.290]  Many didn't make it, and millions ended up in soup lines, becoming vagrants, begging for food.
[00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:20.692]  Unlike 1929, we can see this collapse coming.
[00:20:20.692 --> 00:20:21.973]  We have been warned.
[00:20:21.973 --> 00:20:28.259]  And right now, we have a very small window of opportunity to get food storage into our homes before it's too late.
[00:20:28.259 --> 00:20:28.979]  Too late.
[00:20:28.979 --> 00:20:32.202]  Why is the Canadian government telling their citizens to stock up?
[00:20:32.202 --> 00:20:32.642]  Why?
[00:20:32.642 --> 00:20:36.406]  And why are soldiers calling home telling their families to get food storage?
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:44.684]  Having food storage today may be just as important to your family's survival as boarding the Ark was in the days of Noah.

[00:20:55.131 --> 00:20:57.392]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:07.475]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:14.489]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:21:15.063 --> 00:21:21.646]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:21.646 --> 00:21:23.607]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:23.607 --> 00:21:26.129]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:21:26.129 --> 00:21:37.694]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:21:37.694 --> 00:21:39.375]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:39.375 --> 00:21:40.736]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:21:41.221 --> 00:21:48.128]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:07.331]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[00:23:07.331 --> 00:23:14.793]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:23:14.793 --> 00:23:20.534]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:23:20.534 --> 00:23:22.615]  Starve or surrender.
[00:23:22.615 --> 00:23:27.296]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:23:27.296 --> 00:23:28.196]  What then?
[00:23:30.916 --> 00:23:33.998]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:23:33.998 --> 00:23:38.320]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.182]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.

[00:23:58.451 --> 00:23:59.311]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:24:01.075 --> 00:24:16.545]  You know, uh, last night I got home and saw Kurt had posted an article just minutes before saying
[00:24:28.183 --> 00:24:33.526]  The purported Homeland Security document says gun owners are terrorists.
[00:24:33.526 --> 00:24:36.028]  So I just went and read the document in about 20 minutes.
[00:24:36.028 --> 00:24:39.530]  It's, I don't know, 10-15 pages long.
[00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:47.014]  And I was sure it was real because I'd seen the exact same font, the exact same paragraphs in other reports going back over the years.
[00:24:47.014 --> 00:24:57.521]  I knew that, you know, the nomenclature, the way it was written, the latest info, the control numbers matched other series of federal control numbers I'd seen on documents.
[00:24:59.244 --> 00:25:01.525]  But I went ahead and tested the emails.
[00:25:01.525 --> 00:25:05.507]  I went ahead and called the FBI phone number.
[00:25:05.507 --> 00:25:17.334]  I went ahead and called the Infrastructure Protection Fusion Center numbers on it and talked to the watch captains and confirmed that it was their document.
[00:25:17.334 --> 00:25:21.616]  They were very upset that I had it and were asking me to tell them who gave it to me.
[00:25:21.616 --> 00:25:27.239]  And I explained, no, this has been posted on the big libertarian sites.
[00:25:28.746 --> 00:25:31.207]  But it just broke in the last 12 hours.
[00:25:31.207 --> 00:25:36.528]  And we learned of it with the classic tickets being sent to us saying, why are you covering this up?
[00:25:36.528 --> 00:25:38.189]  Because we weren't aware of it.
[00:25:38.189 --> 00:25:40.629]  Please, folks, it's kind of, it's a little insulting.
[00:25:40.629 --> 00:25:43.950]  We're not, I think people think I'm like Superman or something.
[00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:50.772]  And I can see through walls, you know, I can, but not even Superman was omnipresent and knew all.
[00:25:50.772 --> 00:25:54.173]  I'm not Dr. Manhattan either, I guess, but even Dr. Manhattan
[00:25:54.994 --> 00:25:58.717]  You know, it is not omnipresent.
[00:25:58.717 --> 00:26:05.582]  But thank you for giving it to us nonetheless, so we can cover it up like we're doing writing big articles about it right now.
[00:26:07.222 --> 00:26:10.404]  I just, it's, I just, you know, I got a lot of serious news.
[00:26:10.404 --> 00:26:11.124]  I can't digress.
[00:26:11.124 --> 00:26:13.926]  It just, sometimes it really amazes me.
[00:26:13.926 --> 00:26:17.348]  So, I called the FBI, called the other phone numbers, confirmed.
[00:26:17.348 --> 00:26:26.714]  Yes, this is a federal report, just like we called the MIAC office in Missouri and talked to them, and they said, yeah, that's our report, but we're not going to comment on it.
[00:26:26.714 --> 00:26:29.235]  I read them the two control numbers on it.
[00:26:29.235 --> 00:26:30.336]  I gave them the phone numbers.
[00:26:30.336 --> 00:26:33.458]  I read to them the last paragraph, and he said, where did you get that?
[00:26:33.458 --> 00:26:34.158]  How did you get that?
[00:26:34.158 --> 00:26:34.999]  Tell me how you got that.
[00:26:36.397 --> 00:27:02.508]  and it was uh... one of the guys i talked to uh... was a male uh... some like an african-american nice nice felon very demanding that i get going where it came from other folks i call this would even talk to me they said i'm not gonna talk to him i can talk to you about it but this is the little tattletale squad phone number you can go up to info wars dot com go to the end of the pdf document
[00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:08.311]  And you can call the phone numbers for yourself.
[00:27:08.311 --> 00:27:18.416]  Just like thousands of people did to the state of Missouri for two weeks still saying it was fake until the governor came out and defended it, then backed off of it.
[00:27:18.416 --> 00:27:20.677]  The lieutenant governor called people to resign.
[00:27:20.677 --> 00:27:22.598]  Some of the folks in state government did.
[00:27:22.598 --> 00:27:24.619]  So my report is real.
[00:27:24.619 --> 00:27:29.762]  The worst one I've seen the last few months is the 2009 Virginia terrorism threat assessment
[00:27:30.682 --> 00:27:37.485]  This is a hundred and fifty something pages long and list how they're watching everybody.
[00:27:37.485 --> 00:27:42.827]  This one is the most restricted we've seen yet.
[00:27:42.827 --> 00:27:47.789]  And a lot of cryptic stuff in this new one.
[00:27:47.789 --> 00:27:53.992]  Right-wing extremism, current economic and political climate, fueling resurgence and radicalization and recruitment.
[00:27:56.042 --> 00:27:59.944]  And this one explains that it's basically just the redacted head paragraphs.
[00:27:59.944 --> 00:28:08.508]  It tells police and military, of course, if you want full names, our investigations, how we spout Americans, it says that on the last page.
[00:28:08.508 --> 00:28:11.249]  Just call us and we'll give it to you.
[00:28:11.249 --> 00:28:13.930]  So it is nightmarish, to say the least.
[00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:19.593]  And Paul Watson's in a report, so has Kurt Nimmo to the first report last night.
[00:28:19.593 --> 00:28:23.595]  We altered the report, that is, expanded it last night once I confirmed it was real.
[00:28:26.158 --> 00:28:28.299]  I told Kurt, I said, this is definitely real.
[00:28:28.299 --> 00:28:31.279]  And he said, yeah, it looks like it's real to me, but I'm going to say we don't know that.
[00:28:31.279 --> 00:28:33.280]  I said, let me just call the phone numbers.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.880]  So that went on for about an hour.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:42.682]  And no, it's as real as a gold piece.
[00:28:42.682 --> 00:28:45.343]  So you can put it in the bank.
[00:28:45.343 --> 00:28:46.663]  It's as real as a $10 gold piece.
[00:28:48.487 --> 00:28:52.213]  So, just, it's amazing, gun owners are terrorists.
[00:28:52.213 --> 00:28:58.102]  You're out buying guns and ammo, you are a dangerous terrorist, you're the number one threat, the number one concern to law enforcement right now.
[00:29:00.643 --> 00:29:09.210]  And that they're trying to pass gun restrictions and gun bans and that they believe you're a terrorist and that you're going to resist them.
[00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:12.793]  So they basically say, yes, we're trying to pass gun restriction laws.
[00:29:12.793 --> 00:29:16.776]  They say the Supreme Court ruling allows us to restrict guns.
[00:29:16.776 --> 00:29:19.198]  You've got to love their doublespeak in there.
[00:29:19.198 --> 00:29:22.421]  They say that we're delusional, that there is no problem with the economy.
[00:29:22.421 --> 00:29:28.005]  They actually say it's our perception that we're making it up, that it's our propaganda.
[00:29:28.005 --> 00:29:28.806]  The economy's fine.
[00:29:29.827 --> 00:29:32.969]  I mean, you want to go read 1984 propaganda.
[00:29:32.969 --> 00:29:37.793]  You want to go read the mental illness of what the feds feed local police.
[00:29:37.793 --> 00:29:38.413]  The denial.
[00:29:38.413 --> 00:29:42.816]  Of course, we have this because police did leak it.
[00:29:42.816 --> 00:29:51.482]  We've confirmed that with the original site that put it out.
[00:29:51.482 --> 00:29:52.863]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.863 --> 00:29:55.385]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.385 --> 00:29:58.067]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:05.902 --> 00:30:09.183]  Times are tough right now, and people are unsure about our future.
[00:30:09.183 --> 00:30:13.444]  The economy is hurting, even though there are powers that would make us believe differently.
[00:30:13.444 --> 00:30:16.544]  Banks are failing, and the gold buyers are buying.
[00:30:16.544 --> 00:30:17.264]  Question.
[00:30:17.264 --> 00:30:24.726]  With all the chemicals being put into our air, how do you use gold when you are very sick or dead?
[00:30:24.726 --> 00:30:26.826]  Investing in precious metals is smart.
[00:30:26.826 --> 00:30:29.407]  Investing in your health could be smarter.
[00:30:29.407 --> 00:30:30.207]  Life changed tea.
[00:30:30.822 --> 00:30:33.804]  Changes your life just by drinking our tea.
[00:30:33.804 --> 00:30:41.770]  Detox from deadly chemicals, flush poisons that cause harm to your organs, and lose unwanted pounds that bog you down.
[00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:42.250]  Call us!
[00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:42.630]  928-308-0408.
[00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.811]  Again, 928-308-0408.
[00:30:42.811 --> 00:30:44.272]  Or you can order online at GetTheTea.com.
[00:30:44.272 --> 00:30:45.512]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[00:30:45.512 --> 00:30:46.413]  Life Change Tea.
[00:30:46.413 --> 00:30:47.534]  We're changing lives.
[00:31:01.843 --> 00:31:07.069]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.874 --> 00:31:13.735]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.735 --> 00:31:20.237]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:20.237 --> 00:31:22.217]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:22.217 --> 00:31:24.678]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:24.678 --> 00:31:35.560]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.859 --> 00:31:39.540]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.402]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:41.402 --> 00:31:48.307]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:48.307 --> 00:31:56.573]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.573 --> 00:31:58.134]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:58.134 --> 00:32:01.417]  The people strike back.
[00:32:01.417 --> 00:32:01.897]  You worry.
[00:32:02.284 --> 00:32:04.364]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:32:04.364 --> 00:32:07.005]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:32:07.005 --> 00:32:09.125]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:32:09.125 --> 00:32:10.725]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:32:10.725 --> 00:32:14.326]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:32:14.326 --> 00:32:19.567]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:32:19.567 --> 00:32:23.528]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:32:23.528 --> 00:32:25.228]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:32:25.228 --> 00:32:28.128]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:32:28.128 --> 00:32:31.069]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:32:31.567 --> 00:32:40.230]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:45.032]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[00:32:45.032 --> 00:32:49.054]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[00:32:49.054 --> 00:32:53.075]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:32:53.075 --> 00:32:54.456]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:32:54.456 --> 00:32:56.176]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:33:21.912 --> 00:33:31.814]  In the last hour of the show today, we got former Treasury agent, criminal investigator, Joe Bannister joining us.
[00:33:31.814 --> 00:33:36.655]  He found out the IRS was a private collection agency for the offshore Federal Reserve.
[00:33:36.655 --> 00:33:41.457]  That's who you write your checks to, is the Federal Reserve.
[00:33:41.457 --> 00:33:47.038]  And now we're going to be paying global carbon taxes directly into private banks, and it's openly being announced
[00:33:48.669 --> 00:33:51.011]  Well, I tell ya, it's just getting crazier and crazier.
[00:33:51.011 --> 00:33:52.732]  Naomi Wolf coming up in an hour and a half.
[00:33:52.732 --> 00:33:54.994]  Look, I'm gonna open the phones up.
[00:33:54.994 --> 00:33:56.055]  Coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:56.055 --> 00:33:56.876]  In fact, we'll do it right now.
[00:33:56.876 --> 00:33:56.956]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:56.956 --> 00:33:57.076]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:57.076 --> 00:33:57.396]  But, uh, coming up...
[00:34:07.475 --> 00:34:16.737]  About 10-15 minutes into the next hour after I take some calls, I'm going to do a detailed analysis of the most horrific report we've seen yet.
[00:34:16.737 --> 00:34:26.860]  Now, I said the one last week that came out, the 2009 Virginia Terrorism Threat Assessment, overall is the worst, because it's the most detailed report, it's 150-something pages.
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.640]  We've covered that.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:35.262]  But when it comes to the Second Amendment, the most frightening, the most out of control, is this secret
[00:34:36.203 --> 00:34:42.208]  For official use only, Department of Homeland Security document put out April 7th, so put out last week.
[00:34:42.208 --> 00:34:45.230]  And I have confirmed its authenticity.
[00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:48.833]  And it says American gun owners are terrorists.
[00:34:48.833 --> 00:34:50.275]  Period.
[00:34:50.275 --> 00:34:56.600]  So this is just off the charts.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.982]  Hardcore.
[00:34:58.982 --> 00:35:01.524]  So that is coming up.
[00:35:01.524 --> 00:35:04.947]  And then I'm going to play a clip from
[00:35:09.293 --> 00:35:14.197]  Uh, Joyce Riley's radio show here on Genesis.
[00:35:14.197 --> 00:35:17.060]  And I want to be clear about this.
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:19.181]  I've known Joyce since like 1995.
[00:35:19.181 --> 00:35:23.105]  She's a great lady, really hard working, very talented.
[00:35:23.105 --> 00:35:26.548]  So is Dave.
[00:35:26.548 --> 00:35:26.688]  And...
[00:35:28.254 --> 00:35:31.135]  I'm not criticizing them for having a caller into their show.
[00:35:31.135 --> 00:35:37.699]  I mean, I have callers that call in and, you know, say they have microchips in their brains and that I put the microchips there.
[00:35:37.699 --> 00:35:41.721]  So it's no reflection on Joyce talking to this lady.
[00:35:41.721 --> 00:35:45.783]  It's just that I've been probably sent 500 emails on this if I was sent one.
[00:35:45.783 --> 00:35:47.924]  Probably more than 500.
[00:35:47.924 --> 00:35:49.025]  It's just everywhere.
[00:35:49.025 --> 00:35:56.969]  NuffRespect, who's one of my favorite directors on YouTube, has picked it up and it's had, I don't know, like 30,000 views just in the last few hours.
[00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:03.653]  And this is the kind of stuff they're going to end up putting on Glenn Beck and discrediting us with.
[00:36:03.653 --> 00:36:07.235]  And I'm not bashing anybody for picking this up and looking at it.
[00:36:07.235 --> 00:36:10.997]  I don't blame anybody for not trusting the government.
[00:36:10.997 --> 00:36:18.682]  I mean, they admittedly, tens of thousands of times, have been caught testing chemical, biological, radiologicals on the American people.
[00:36:18.682 --> 00:36:22.564]  So we have to take all of this stuff seriously.
[00:36:22.564 --> 00:36:26.747]  It's just that, listen to this tape, I know, without a shadow of a doubt, it's absolute bull.
[00:36:28.138 --> 00:36:34.843]  I know, because I studied this and I wrote notes on it last night, and then the notes just don't do it justice.
[00:36:34.843 --> 00:36:43.808]  I'm going to have to play it piece by piece and comment on it, because it isn't just this lady hyperventilating and freaking out.
[00:36:43.808 --> 00:36:48.091]  And I have no doubt that she didn't talk to some schizophrenic truck driver who really believes this.
[00:36:48.091 --> 00:36:50.473]  I've just learned what's bull and what isn't.
[00:36:50.473 --> 00:36:54.175]  And I really have never been wrong.
[00:36:54.175 --> 00:36:56.697]  I've only been wrong in the past because I didn't follow my instincts.
[00:37:00.299 --> 00:37:02.480]  But there's a lot of reasons and I'll explain that.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:09.364]  Meanwhile, meanwhile, the real bird flu situation is off the charts.
[00:37:09.364 --> 00:37:10.345]  People are dying.
[00:37:10.345 --> 00:37:13.307]  They're being given experimental live bird flu shots.
[00:37:14.289 --> 00:37:15.490]  It mutates in the body.
[00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:17.171]  It could go airborne anytime.
[00:37:17.171 --> 00:37:19.893]  There is definitely something going on with this.
[00:37:19.893 --> 00:37:26.338]  And that's why it's so suspected right at the time we have all this serious news, we have this type of hysteria going on.
[00:37:26.338 --> 00:37:34.003]  But see, again, what do you expect when the people learn just how criminal the government is?
[00:37:34.003 --> 00:37:36.805]  So that is coming up after I get into this new report.
[00:37:39.784 --> 00:37:45.648]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, American gun owners, buying guns, buying ammo, you are a terrorist.
[00:37:45.648 --> 00:37:48.670]  You are the number one threat to the federal government and police.
[00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:53.052]  That's what document number 1A-0257-09 says.
[00:37:53.052 --> 00:37:53.213]  1A-0257-09.
[00:37:53.213 --> 00:37:58.536]  And you can call the FBI up right now and they'll tell you it's their document.
[00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:15.774]  And we need the media to call them up and have them confirm it, because when I tell you it's confirmed, people will deny it all day until the AP, a week from now, goes, oh yeah, they told us it's real.
[00:38:15.774 --> 00:38:19.515]  So I don't get 500 more emails saying I made this up or that I wrote this.
[00:38:19.515 --> 00:38:29.758]  Just like I did with MIAC and the 2009 Virginia Terrorism Threat Assessment, which they confirm is real, and everything else, or the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[00:38:29.758 --> 00:38:31.059]  When I posted a month ago,
[00:38:32.813 --> 00:38:35.894]  That's the key to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:38:35.894 --> 00:38:41.937]  They are the biggest thing out there, the biggest game in town when it comes to alternative media.
[00:38:41.937 --> 00:38:51.560]  And so this didn't break when it was in Bloomberg and Toronto Star and Czechoslovakian newspapers, Czech Republic newspapers.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:58.703]  It broke and became a big sensation when we linked to the mainstream articles and wrote an article about it.
[00:38:58.703 --> 00:39:00.784]  And that's the incredible responsibility we have here.
[00:39:02.619 --> 00:39:05.885]  This has been out for a few days, this federal document.
[00:39:05.885 --> 00:39:09.231]  But hey, nobody thought to call the feds to confirm if it was real or not.
[00:39:09.231 --> 00:39:12.598]  They just said, oh look, this has been released by a law enforcement source.
[00:39:15.458 --> 00:39:18.421]  So we also do little basic journalism, things like that.
[00:39:18.421 --> 00:39:20.644]  And I don't claim to be the cat's meow of journalism either.
[00:39:20.644 --> 00:39:21.445]  I don't have the time or energy.
[00:39:21.445 --> 00:39:30.735]  I mean, I'm like a cook who's got a hundred dishes, you know, out here on the stove, and I'm trying to do that while I wash dishes and while I clean tables, while I bust tables.
[00:39:30.735 --> 00:39:34.520]  But I mean, the amount of documents we get and troops running checkpoints and
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:44.588]  We had Federal Reserve security guards run up off Federal Reserve property and threatened to arrest Aaron Dykes and Rob Jacobson in Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:39:44.588 --> 00:39:48.712]  They're just driving down the road from doing an interview and they go, look, there's a Federal Reserve branch, let's videotape it.
[00:39:48.712 --> 00:39:53.196]  They're on a park across the street, 150 yards away, but they run over and say, we're going to arrest you.
[00:39:54.844 --> 00:39:56.485]  If you don't tell us your names.
[00:39:56.485 --> 00:40:00.509]  And then they... One of them tells them their names, which I wouldn't have done, but fine.
[00:40:00.509 --> 00:40:02.951]  And then they say, okay, we're still going to arrest you if you don't leave.
[00:40:02.951 --> 00:40:04.152]  Don't point your cameras at us.
[00:40:04.152 --> 00:40:07.014]  And you know, that happened at the D.C.
[00:40:07.014 --> 00:40:10.297]  Federal Reserve to a major news reporter.
[00:40:10.297 --> 00:40:10.978]  That footage is out there.
[00:40:10.978 --> 00:40:12.619]  These people come off their own property.
[00:40:12.619 --> 00:40:14.120]  It's not even federal.
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:15.662]  And they just say, I don't have to tell you a law.
[00:40:15.662 --> 00:40:17.103]  I'm going to arrest you.
[00:40:17.103 --> 00:40:18.444]  Don't aim your camera at our building.
[00:40:18.444 --> 00:40:19.345]  There's no First Amendment.
[00:40:21.408 --> 00:40:27.451]  But meanwhile, they cower and hide inside when we have hundreds of protesters at all 38 of their criminal locations.
[00:40:27.451 --> 00:40:34.635]  And then it turns out they have the army spying on us, saying we're terrorists when I was in Dallas with Ron Paul's brother.
[00:40:34.635 --> 00:40:38.997]  And they have the army spying on Ron Paul in Houston, across the street at a park.
[00:40:38.997 --> 00:40:40.698]  You know, they think it's illegal.
[00:40:40.698 --> 00:40:49.302]  And by the way, this new federal document, right-wing extremism, current economic and political climate fueling resurgence and radicalization recruitment,
[00:40:54.110 --> 00:41:09.644]  This thing is just an amazing document, and calls the American people terrorists, and says that if you talk about the economy falling apart, you're basically a terrorist.
[00:41:09.644 --> 00:41:11.045]  So I'm going to be going over that, like I said.
[00:41:11.045 --> 00:41:12.066]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:41:12.066 --> 00:41:14.288]  I've got a bunch of notes on that.
[00:41:17.765 --> 00:41:20.446]  The stories need to go mega-viral.
[00:41:20.446 --> 00:41:25.189]  Paul Watson's Secret Homeland Security Threat Assessment labels gun owners potential terrorists.
[00:41:25.189 --> 00:41:26.250]  It doesn't even say potential.
[00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:30.292]  It says the terrorists are buying guns and ammo.
[00:41:30.292 --> 00:41:32.493]  Kurt Nemmutter, another fine report.
[00:41:32.493 --> 00:41:34.534]  Now, here's some of the other bombshell news.
[00:41:34.534 --> 00:41:36.255]  And I mean bombshell.
[00:41:36.255 --> 00:41:38.396]  China slows purchases of U.S.
[00:41:38.396 --> 00:41:39.477]  and other bonds.
[00:41:40.305 --> 00:41:53.508]  So China, the biggest owner of debt worldwide, formerly it was Japan, they're still number two, and the Arabs, number three, they are moving away from currencies, period, because they're inflating them all.
[00:41:53.508 --> 00:41:57.228]  That's the New York Times.
[00:41:57.228 --> 00:42:06.030]  Attenborough warns on population, the broadcaster Sir David Attenborough has become a patron of a group seeking to cut the growth of the human population.
[00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:09.771]  Yeah, I had the Optimum Population Trust on that Prince Philip's a part of a few years ago, remember?
[00:42:11.121 --> 00:42:13.042]  He said it was basically a crime that I had two children.
[00:42:13.042 --> 00:42:13.462]  I said, that's it.
[00:42:13.462 --> 00:42:15.842]  I'm going to have another one and I did.
[00:42:15.842 --> 00:42:20.303]  Went home and my wife was pregnant within a week.
[00:42:20.303 --> 00:42:28.646]  It says, Sir David has been increasingly vocal about the need to reduce the number of people on earth to protect wildlife.
[00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:29.566]  Oh yes, no.
[00:42:29.566 --> 00:42:31.986]  So you can just be a control freak and dehumanize people.
[00:42:31.986 --> 00:42:33.407]  He's a eugenicist, folks.
[00:42:33.407 --> 00:42:34.287]  And here's another one.
[00:42:34.287 --> 00:42:37.368]  UK population must fall to 30 million
[00:42:39.087 --> 00:42:40.289]  That's the government.
[00:42:40.289 --> 00:42:44.798]  They want to reduce the number by half.
[00:42:44.798 --> 00:42:50.650]  It turns out that the police had a corrupt pathologist lie and say that
[00:42:52.145 --> 00:42:54.145]  This guy died of a heart attack when it wasn't true.
[00:42:54.145 --> 00:42:55.266]  That's London Guardian.
[00:42:55.266 --> 00:42:57.986]  They just beat a guy delivering newspapers to death.
[00:42:57.986 --> 00:42:59.627]  And then they just said, oh, he had a heart attack.
[00:42:59.627 --> 00:43:00.027]  Didn't matter.
[00:43:00.027 --> 00:43:03.208]  The cops all videotaped the murder that they committed.
[00:43:03.208 --> 00:43:09.109]  And now it's coming out that they did this and that this pathologist specializes in covering things up for the police.
[00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:17.651]  Well, yeah, it's like Famy Malik over in Arkansas, where you'd have people shoot themselves twice in the back of the head with a shotgun.
[00:43:18.865 --> 00:43:29.511]  There were cases where people's arms and legs were chopped off, they were put in plastic bags with gasoline poured on them, they'd be found in trash dumps, their dead bodies cut up, and he would rule it suicide.
[00:43:29.511 --> 00:43:34.393]  They killed a bunch of cops that exposed what was happening, they had a machine gun them off the road and say it was suicide.
[00:43:34.393 --> 00:43:39.856]  Because, you know, they were openly running cocaine in there.
[00:43:39.856 --> 00:43:46.580]  And he was the local medical examiner that covered up the dead kids on the train tracks and the rest of it, so Clinton made him the state medical examiner.
[00:43:47.742 --> 00:43:48.462]  Yeah, I love it!
[00:43:48.462 --> 00:43:50.143]  The government's so disgusting!
[00:43:50.143 --> 00:43:55.925]  That's like Dr. David Kelly, former head of bioweapons development at Porton Down.
[00:43:55.925 --> 00:44:00.187]  He blew the whistle about WMDs not being in Iraq.
[00:44:00.187 --> 00:44:06.909]  He sent an email out to more than 10 colleagues, including newspapers, saying, well, I've been told I'm going to be found dead in the woods for what I've done.
[00:44:06.909 --> 00:44:10.611]  I just want to say bye to everybody then, if they kill me.
[00:44:11.727 --> 00:44:20.611]  And then the police come up and five guys in black uniforms, in the early morning dawn at a local park, run away from his body.
[00:44:20.611 --> 00:44:31.196]  The police come up, he has slit wrist, but no blood, meaning they were slit after he was dead, and three undigested pills in his stomach, and they said that he slit his wrist and took pills.
[00:44:31.556 --> 00:44:41.650]  I mean, folks, I could be murdered, and you could see the men in black uniforms, the literal ringwraiths could be on me and run away, dumping my body, and they would say, oh, Alex killed himself.
[00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:44.734]  I mean, that's how corrupt these medical examiners are.
[00:44:46.971 --> 00:44:52.253]  That's like cop-of-the-year Terrence Yakey, sables people in OKC, saw the BATF involved in the bombing.
[00:44:52.253 --> 00:44:54.394]  He was driving by when it happened.
[00:44:54.394 --> 00:44:58.916]  He called his partner and said, hey, I went to the storage shed to get out the evidence.
[00:44:58.916 --> 00:45:00.516]  I'm getting followed by FBI.
[00:45:00.516 --> 00:45:06.759]  They pull him over, torture him for hours in a field, shoot him in the back of the head, torture him all over his body.
[00:45:06.759 --> 00:45:15.563]  I mean, that's who your government is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:15.563 --> 00:45:16.503]  So I've got that report.
[00:45:18.755 --> 00:45:22.778]  I've seen five different reports in the last week of people murdering people with cars.
[00:45:22.778 --> 00:45:28.161]  I just said we should ban cars and we should write articles about what these people that kill people with cars are reading.
[00:45:28.161 --> 00:45:29.422]  They're reading the Sports Illustrated.
[00:45:29.422 --> 00:45:31.563]  Sports Illustrated is causing the murders.
[00:45:31.563 --> 00:45:37.967]  I mean, that's the measure that I'm being blamed for with the cop killer who hated me, but that doesn't matter.
[00:45:37.967 --> 00:45:42.670]  By the way, that's in the new federal report.
[00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:48.054]  Black voters waver on support for Patterson than the New York
[00:45:50.205 --> 00:45:55.610]  Governor, that replaced the one they set up, and he's saying, oh, it's because white people don't like him.
[00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:59.874]  You know, I mean, this is really getting old, folks.
[00:45:59.874 --> 00:46:08.462]  No one likes you because you just passed 80 plus taxes.
[00:46:08.462 --> 00:46:10.144]  So, that's some of what's going on.
[00:46:10.144 --> 00:46:15.849]  Former Obama advisor, CFR VP, says 100,000 troops, 10 more years needed in Afghanistan.
[00:46:17.865 --> 00:46:24.788]  Now here's the really big news also on the economy.
[00:46:24.788 --> 00:46:27.910]  GM told to prep for bankruptcy filing report.
[00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:37.514]  The federal government files the last executive and then tells GM what to do and how to file bankruptcy and that'll be handed over to Obama's cronies.
[00:46:37.514 --> 00:46:43.657]  Just like the IMF and World Bank come in and bankrupt third world countries by design and then tell them we'll give you more fiat loans backed up by U.S.
[00:46:43.657 --> 00:46:45.558]  taxpayers.
[00:46:45.558 --> 00:46:46.819]  You've just got to do what we say.
[00:46:50.489 --> 00:46:56.634]  And that is, take the money we give you, and then invest that with our own private corporations.
[00:46:56.634 --> 00:47:06.141]  See, the private banks take our money, give it to the third world, and then have the third world, by agreements they sign, invest it in globalist corporations in those nations.
[00:47:06.761 --> 00:47:16.267]  And then they have tax incentives in the US and Europe and Australia and New Zealand to then ship our jobs offshore to the IMF and World Bank financed factories.
[00:47:16.267 --> 00:47:19.589]  So your tax money pays to build the factories.
[00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:24.391]  The people in the third world nations get slave wages.
[00:47:24.391 --> 00:47:26.833]  And again, there's tax incentives to move the corporations there.
[00:47:29.741 --> 00:47:36.547]  But that's, the Club of Rome and UN and others brag that is to actually destroy industry and destroy the West so there's no markets.
[00:47:36.547 --> 00:47:46.054]  As the fiat economy, the banking economy, wages war against the real economy and tries to create a quote, post-industrial world.
[00:47:46.054 --> 00:47:48.036]  You understand what they're setting up here?
[00:47:48.036 --> 00:47:57.424]  Where there'll be highly controlled government and private corporate reservations, it'll be high technology zones, there'll be technological, there already are technological spheres
[00:47:58.646 --> 00:47:58.946]  That's right.
[00:48:13.663 --> 00:48:19.229]  Private manners and plantation type situations outside the megacities.
[00:48:19.229 --> 00:48:21.492]  And this is all stated by him.
[00:48:21.492 --> 00:48:27.518]  People keep saying, oh Alex, they totally had a world government, a new world order, this would have already happened and you wouldn't be on air.
[00:48:27.518 --> 00:48:29.400]  That's right, they don't have it yet.
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:30.962]  They're very close to completing it.
[00:48:30.962 --> 00:48:33.304]  They got their World Bank, World Army, World Regulations.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:37.302]  They've bankrupted all the nations by design through fiat currency.
[00:48:37.302 --> 00:48:42.005]  They're openly setting up world government now with world taxes to be paid directly to them.
[00:48:42.005 --> 00:48:47.748]  Brown has announced compulsory national youth service will become a normal part of growing up in Britain.
[00:48:47.748 --> 00:48:50.850]  I forgot that article, folks, on InfoWars.com.
[00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:52.331]  I printed it, but it didn't print.
[00:48:52.331 --> 00:48:53.452]  I just saw that up on screen.
[00:48:54.343 --> 00:48:59.104]  We're getting ready to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv in 10 minutes, 12 minutes or so.
[00:48:59.104 --> 00:49:00.144]  They've got it up on screen.
[00:49:00.144 --> 00:49:00.784]  I forgot that.
[00:49:00.784 --> 00:49:02.925]  I mean, here he is openly announcing what they're announcing here.
[00:49:02.925 --> 00:49:07.085]  Notice Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Canada, U.S.
[00:49:07.085 --> 00:49:09.226]  are all announcing the same program, same time.
[00:49:09.226 --> 00:49:12.806]  It's global!
[00:49:12.806 --> 00:49:18.427]  The IMF and World Bank control the world's economic system with the Ex-Im Bank and National Bank of Settlements.
[00:49:18.427 --> 00:49:22.288]  The OECD sets the global taxation system.
[00:49:23.743 --> 00:49:30.667]  UNESCO, the United Nations Educational Cultural Organization sets college and school systems and sets your local zoning laws.
[00:49:30.667 --> 00:49:34.429]  Everything is already under global government.
[00:49:34.429 --> 00:49:36.730]  And you gotta ask, what's that global government gonna look like?
[00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:37.410]  Who are these people?
[00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:38.431]  What are they building?
[00:49:38.431 --> 00:49:42.053]  A totally controlled and slave society.
[00:49:42.053 --> 00:49:47.956]  A slave grid.
[00:49:47.956 --> 00:49:50.417]  They're eugenicists.
[00:49:50.417 --> 00:49:51.998]  Alright, we're gonna come back and take your calls.
[00:49:54.019 --> 00:49:55.370]  That's just some of the nerves I have.
[00:49:56.254 --> 00:49:57.335]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:49:57.335 --> 00:50:09.782]  I do want to plug again the fact that the Obama Deception is out on DVD with the 20-plus minutes of extras in the highest quality, shattering the left-right paradigm, showing who Obama is, how he's betraying people.
[00:50:09.782 --> 00:50:11.764]  The film has gone mega-viral everywhere.
[00:50:11.764 --> 00:50:14.705]  People are getting the high-quality DVD and making copies.
[00:50:14.705 --> 00:50:16.166]  Get it at InfoWars.com.
[00:50:16.166 --> 00:50:24.852]  If you're going to make copies, get it with the highest quality at InfoWars.com, and that gives us a moderate support, a modicum of support.
[00:50:25.592 --> 00:50:27.573]  Modest support we need to continue operating.
[00:50:27.573 --> 00:50:30.715]  Infowars.com, please order the Answer to 1984-1776 t-shirts.
[00:50:30.715 --> 00:50:31.075]  We have a new

[00:50:59.086 --> 00:50:59.487]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.767 --> 00:51:05.288]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:51:05.288 --> 00:51:07.208]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:51:07.208 --> 00:51:12.770]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:20.792]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[00:51:20.792 --> 00:51:31.374]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity
[00:51:31.374 --> 00:51:31.714]  I think so.
[00:52:02.324 --> 00:52:08.148]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:08.148 --> 00:52:15.172]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:15.723 --> 00:52:21.910]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:24.292]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:24.292 --> 00:52:26.795]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:26.795 --> 00:52:37.747]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.022]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:40.022 --> 00:52:41.884]  It's about a one world government.
[00:52:41.884 --> 00:52:48.791]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:48.791 --> 00:52:57.059]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:57.059 --> 00:52:58.640]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:52:59.842]  The people strike back.
[00:53:01.633 --> 00:53:05.878]  If you have over $10,000 in credit card debt, you need to hear this.
[00:53:05.878 --> 00:53:10.783]  Have you been watching the banks getting their bailout money and wondering where your relief is?
[00:53:10.783 --> 00:53:13.366]  The answer you're looking for is the bailout group.
[00:53:13.366 --> 00:53:18.912]  The bailout group has settled over $100 million in credit card debt for people just like you.
[00:53:18.912 --> 00:53:23.077]  The bailout group can help cut your debt by up to 60% of its original value.
[00:53:23.097 --> 00:53:23.898]  We're good to go.
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:51.484]  Debt relief experts are standing by.
[00:53:51.484 --> 00:53:54.650]  You have nothing to lose except your credit card debt.
[00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:54.951]  Call 800-324-6554.
[00:53:54.951 --> 00:53:55.111]  800-324-6554 today!
[00:54:19.474 --> 00:54:21.314]  Okay, jam-packed.
[00:54:21.314 --> 00:54:27.875]  Second hour coming up, then Naomi Wolf, I'm gonna ask the Chief Liberal Progressive, what has Lord Obama done?
[00:54:27.875 --> 00:54:36.897]  Because I remember telling her, right when Obama got elected, I said, Naomi Wolf, look out, Obama's gonna be just as bad or worse than Bush.
[00:54:36.897 --> 00:54:37.637]  He's just a puppet.
[00:54:37.637 --> 00:54:39.577]  And she went, no!
[00:54:39.577 --> 00:54:40.998]  No, it can't be!
[00:54:40.998 --> 00:54:43.958]  That's impossible!
[00:54:43.958 --> 00:54:46.339]  Search your feelings, Naomi.
[00:54:46.339 --> 00:54:47.699]  You know it to be true.
[00:54:47.699 --> 00:54:48.779]  Alright, I'll quit screwing around.
[00:54:49.534 --> 00:54:57.618]  Also, I saw this crazy documentary this weekend, The King of America, about the Reverend Moon.
[00:54:57.618 --> 00:55:01.160]  I mean, I knew that guy was whacked out, but this thing is just crazy.
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.160]  I won't have time to play with it.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.181]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:55:04.181 --> 00:55:07.063]  Matthew in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:55:07.063 --> 00:55:10.284]  Welcome.
[00:55:10.284 --> 00:55:11.245]  Hey, God bless you, Alex.
[00:55:11.245 --> 00:55:17.788]  This is Matthew from San Antonio Change reporting in on a pre-Tea Party update.
[00:55:17.788 --> 00:55:18.008]  Okay.
[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:28.403]  Okay, um, what we're dealing with here is the San Antonio Tea Party is basically saying they don't want any Bullhorns because they don't want Alex Jones here.
[00:55:28.403 --> 00:55:33.824]  And they said, um, one of our guys is infiltrating their group and he's basically getting intel for us.
[00:55:33.824 --> 00:55:40.266]  And he said, yeah, they don't want any Bullhorns because they're troublemakers, so anybody with a Bullhorn is a troublemaker.
[00:55:42.566 --> 00:55:46.048]  Sounds like they should be working for the Redcoats.
[00:55:46.048 --> 00:55:48.750]  I mean, there's no need ninnying, there's no freedom.
[00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:51.152]  We'll just have your own tea party.
[00:55:51.152 --> 00:55:55.755]  But no, that's why Fox News and Glenn Beck are trying to take over the tea parties.
[00:55:56.809 --> 00:56:00.692]  Yeah, and you know, Glenn Beck is going to be there, so of course we're going to be there.
[00:56:00.692 --> 00:56:07.858]  Right now we have 1,700 Obama Deception DVDs packaged and ready to go, ready for delivery.
[00:56:07.858 --> 00:56:09.680]  Well, listen, I'm not going to be there.
[00:56:12.142 --> 00:56:15.863]  I'm going to be here on air, doing interviews, talking to millions of people.
[00:56:15.863 --> 00:56:18.503]  We don't have some ax to grind with Beck.
[00:56:18.503 --> 00:56:20.744]  I mean, the guy set a restaurant, Paul Supporters.
[00:56:20.744 --> 00:56:24.024]  He keeps linking people that believe in a new world order to McVeigh.
[00:56:24.024 --> 00:56:26.105]  I know he's a Judas goat.
[00:56:26.105 --> 00:56:29.985]  To get everybody's confidence, I told people he was going to say the FEMA camps weren't real.
[00:56:29.985 --> 00:56:35.286]  So I know the guy's an actor, and he's being set up to keep betraying us in the future.
[00:56:35.286 --> 00:56:37.747]  But Beck has announced, and I confirmed it, I heard the clip.
[00:56:38.972 --> 00:56:43.994]  Last Friday he said, oh, I'm not going to speak at the tea party now because these crazies are coming.
[00:56:43.994 --> 00:56:45.535]  Glenn, don't be afraid of us.
[00:56:45.535 --> 00:56:47.115]  You have your First Amendment.
[00:56:47.115 --> 00:56:48.716]  Get up and give your speech.
[00:56:48.716 --> 00:56:51.997]  We would never think of trying to stop you.
[00:56:51.997 --> 00:56:55.279]  We're just sending a camera crew down there to show the tea parties.
[00:56:55.979 --> 00:57:08.848]  For the film, and we are going to hand out some documents and DVDs of mainstream government documents with the FEMA camps, because you're a liar, Glenn, and we're going to show people the truth.
[00:57:08.848 --> 00:57:16.013]  So I don't know why that's so scary, but I guarantee, because we've had folks go to Glenn Beck events before, people I know have gone.
[00:57:16.993 --> 00:57:21.694]  Before he had Blackwater there, and they try to get in your face and act like he's the president or something.
[00:57:21.694 --> 00:57:24.355]  Look, the wicked fleeth when none pursueth.
[00:57:24.355 --> 00:57:30.376]  And so, yeah, you guys have folks inside the tea parties and, you know, they don't want Alex Jones.
[00:57:30.376 --> 00:57:33.777]  Notice how they're co-opting the Ron Paul in the Fed movement.
[00:57:33.777 --> 00:57:35.857]  Notice how they're trying to take over what we're doing.
[00:57:35.857 --> 00:57:36.778]  It's disgusting!
[00:57:36.778 --> 00:57:41.899]  The Republican, fake Republicans, show up at our movement and then tell us we're not welcome.
[00:57:41.899 --> 00:57:42.379]  Don't you love it?
[00:57:43.667 --> 00:57:44.427]  Oh yeah, we love it.
[00:57:44.427 --> 00:57:47.549]  And if you look on their website, they have pictures.
[00:57:47.549 --> 00:57:50.670]  They have what's acceptable for the signs.
[00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:57.434]  Anybody that's planning on bringing signs on their website, they have what they consider to be acceptable signs.
[00:57:57.434 --> 00:58:00.155]  Oh, so they're the thought police.
[00:58:00.155 --> 00:58:05.437]  I mean, not even the liberal commies tell their members, you know, you can bring this, you can't bring that.
[00:58:05.437 --> 00:58:06.498]  What website is this?
[00:58:06.498 --> 00:58:07.578]  We need to do an article on this.
[00:58:07.578 --> 00:58:08.679]  This is outrageous.
[00:58:08.679 --> 00:58:09.759]  Yeah, for real, Alex.
[00:58:09.759 --> 00:58:12.681]  It's SATParty.info.
[00:58:13.933 --> 00:58:16.895]  Oh my god, you're not allowed to criticize Obama over all the new taxes!
[00:58:16.895 --> 00:58:20.297]  Oh Americans, you're not allowed to have a sign, oh my!
[00:58:20.297 --> 00:58:22.958]  Stay there, this is really getting disgusting.
[00:58:42.972 --> 00:58:46.375]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.375 --> 00:58:51.299]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.299 --> 00:58:51.939]  Hello, friends.
[00:58:51.939 --> 00:58:53.000]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.724]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.724 --> 00:59:00.706]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.706 --> 00:59:03.728]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.728 --> 00:59:09.593]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:59:09.813 --> 00:59:13.056]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:13.056 --> 00:59:20.042]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:20.042 --> 00:59:23.325]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:59:23.325 --> 00:59:23.606]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:23.606 --> 00:59:24.867]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:34.714]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-stride, dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:59:34.714 --> 00:59:38.496]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:38.496 --> 00:59:40.017]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:40.017 --> 00:59:40.478]  Take action today.
[00:59:40.478 --> 00:59:42.299]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:54.016 --> 00:59:56.398]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.398 --> 01:00:05.844]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.844 --> 01:00:07.145]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:08.906]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.906 --> 01:00:10.667]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.667 --> 01:00:12.248]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.248 --> 01:00:13.809]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.809 --> 01:00:17.992]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.992 --> 01:00:20.334]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:21.229 --> 01:00:23.110]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:26.571]  Look, there's no doubt there's intelligence operations going on.
[01:00:26.571 --> 01:00:29.692]  The Feds admit they're trying to infiltrate the Patriot movement and take it over.
[01:00:29.692 --> 01:00:33.914]  Because we're the only hope of stopping the offshore private banks from taking over.
[01:00:33.914 --> 01:00:40.796]  We're the people that exposed that they would bankrupt the economy using derivatives, announce a new Bank of the World, announce a new global currency.
[01:00:40.796 --> 01:00:45.578]  Everything we said is now happening, so the public is all turning for Ron Paul, myself, and many others.
[01:00:47.096 --> 01:00:48.957]  So what does Glenn Beck and the Feds do?
[01:00:48.957 --> 01:00:51.698]  They are openly taking over with the 9-12 movement.
[01:00:51.698 --> 01:00:53.998]  The Tea Party's happening all over the country.
[01:00:53.998 --> 01:00:56.799]  And they tell their members, you will not, and I confirmed that.
[01:00:56.799 --> 01:00:58.060]  We're looking at their website right now.
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:00:59.960]  I'll put this on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.521]  We go live in eight minutes.
[01:01:01.521 --> 01:01:03.782]  You are not allowed to have signs
[01:01:05.002 --> 01:01:07.524]  uh... that say, impeach Obama.
[01:01:07.524 --> 01:01:11.047]  You can't show the hope change symbol with a hammer and sickle.
[01:01:11.047 --> 01:01:12.068]  Obama been lying.
[01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:13.810]  You can't say Obama's a liar.
[01:01:13.810 --> 01:01:15.751]  I mean, no criticism of government.
[01:01:15.751 --> 01:01:17.172]  It's about being gelded.
[01:01:17.172 --> 01:01:21.396]  And then they have the nerve above it to have it say, don't tread on me.
[01:01:21.396 --> 01:01:23.057]  And all of this stuff.
[01:01:23.057 --> 01:01:25.699]  I mean, you know, this is what America is.
[01:01:25.699 --> 01:01:31.284]  Teaching you how to be a bunch of... In fact, in the new FEMA report,
[01:01:32.381 --> 01:01:35.262]  Put out by the Feds, a new secret one we just posted.
[01:01:35.262 --> 01:01:42.046]  It says we may not allow, you know, some free speech is allowed, but we may have to restrict free speech in America.
[01:01:42.046 --> 01:01:50.170]  It says, you know, people protesting illegal aliens might be covered by the First Amendment, but not in all cases, if we think it might lead to violence.
[01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:57.814]  And that's why the Feds say, oh, you can only be in a free speech zone, you know, two miles from here, because there might be a fight with you and other protesters.
[01:02:00.233 --> 01:02:02.495]  I mean, can you imagine Glenn Beck, that ninny?
[01:02:02.495 --> 01:02:06.739]  I mean, he's a ninny.
[01:02:06.739 --> 01:02:15.827]  He sits up there in ninnies and does all these effeminate gestures, and I mean, I feel like I'm... Well, you know what I feel like.
[01:02:15.827 --> 01:02:20.391]  I mean, it's just... And nothing, you know, against men that are effeminate.
[01:02:20.391 --> 01:02:26.316]  It's just that he... I mean, he fits the effeminate scammer archetype for me.
[01:02:28.135 --> 01:02:50.486]  uh... you know that the uh... that that that i call it fake nanny charm give a round of folks in business and life and in which you have a lot of experience you learn people the fake nanny charm that these are people to watch these are people that will stab you in the back in five seconds and uh... he is off the charts with the fake nanny charm
[01:02:51.477 --> 01:02:53.158]  I don't want to make my show about Glenn Beck.
[01:02:53.158 --> 01:02:58.800]  It's just that we're sending We Are Change, 9-11 Truth, other groups.
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.361]  By sending, they say they're going.
[01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:03.242]  No orders from headquarters here.
[01:03:03.242 --> 01:03:05.743]  Down there to give them Obama deceptions and other things.
[01:03:05.743 --> 01:03:08.784]  Obama's going to the big university in Phoenix.
[01:03:10.546 --> 01:03:15.914]  Arizona State University, and they're close to making 10,000 copies of that to hand it out.
[01:03:15.914 --> 01:03:17.656]  I mean, the establishment's upset.
[01:03:17.656 --> 01:03:18.497]  And look, I'm sorry.
[01:03:18.497 --> 01:03:20.220]  We're going to stand up to you and the bankers.
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:23.565]  You know, the private Federal Reserve, admittedly, has sent out tens of thousands
[01:03:25.103 --> 01:03:31.450]  of bank workers to be paid to go to universities, high schools, you name it, and brainwash people about how great the Federal Reserve was.
[01:03:31.450 --> 01:03:40.759]  When I was protesting the Federal Reserve last year in Dallas on End of Fed Day, November 22nd, while we were outside being watched by the Army and being called terrorists in Army documents we later got,
[01:03:41.755 --> 01:03:53.185]  They had hundreds of high school teachers and professors in there being paid, being taught a weekend course how to go out and brainwash people that how great the new global currency is and how great the fellow reserve is.
[01:03:53.185 --> 01:03:59.871]  Because these criminals are destroying America and they know they've got to be politically active and suppress us exposing them.
[01:04:01.283 --> 01:04:02.283]  And so that's all this is.
[01:04:02.283 --> 01:04:05.585]  They're trying to take over our Tea Party movement, and it isn't going to work.
[01:04:05.585 --> 01:04:10.186]  So everybody, go to Glenn Beck's stinking Tea Party movement, have whatever sign you want.
[01:04:10.186 --> 01:04:13.228]  They're not going to be able to have the cops stop everybody's signs.
[01:04:13.228 --> 01:04:16.149]  And I would have impeach Obama's sign, since they say those are banned.
[01:04:16.149 --> 01:04:19.730]  And Obamanism, with the communist symbol.
[01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:22.931]  And you're fired, and revolution is brewing.
[01:04:22.931 --> 01:04:28.814]  And you know, it's your First Amendment, they're advertising this as public events, but they're trying to tell you what you can and can't bring.
[01:04:29.818 --> 01:04:33.279]  You know, I'm tempted now to saddle up and go down there myself.
[01:04:33.279 --> 01:04:36.440]  Because, you know, this is in Texas.
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:39.220]  Where Texas' ancestors fought and died against tyranny.
[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:43.201]  And they're going to be sliming around in front of the Alamo, telling people what they can and can't say.
[01:04:43.201 --> 01:04:46.762]  Can you imagine if they told Colonel William Travis what he could and couldn't say?
[01:04:46.762 --> 01:04:49.523]  He'd say, shut up, tyrant!
[01:04:49.523 --> 01:04:54.324]  I mean, you know, this is where they castrate people.
[01:04:54.324 --> 01:04:58.705]  So, if you're part of this event on Glenn Beck's side, you're just there to have your testicles chopped off.
[01:05:01.733 --> 01:05:05.177]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:05:05.177 --> 01:05:09.462]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:05:09.462 --> 01:05:17.411]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[01:05:17.691 --> 01:05:18.111]  We're good to go!
[01:05:49.358 --> 01:05:52.840]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:57.282]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:21.892]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:21.892 --> 01:06:23.933]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:23.933 --> 01:06:26.413]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:06:26.413 --> 01:06:37.397]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:06:37.998 --> 01:06:39.659]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:39.659 --> 01:06:41.521]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:06:41.521 --> 01:06:48.446]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:09.734]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.734 --> 01:08:14.999]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.999 --> 01:08:17.180]  We are Change San Antonio called in.
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:22.141]  By the way, we just started simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:22.141 --> 01:08:25.742]  Put that San Antonio Tea Party website back up.
[01:08:25.742 --> 01:08:26.902]  They've been going to these meetings.
[01:08:26.902 --> 01:08:29.942]  You know, it's Ron Paul that started the tea parties.
[01:08:29.942 --> 01:08:36.364]  It's Gary Franchi and others that started the In the Fed protest.
[01:08:36.364 --> 01:08:41.585]  You know, it's our movement against the private bankers that are looting and raping us, which is very popular right now.
[01:08:41.585 --> 01:08:43.185]  The people know it's the truth.
[01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:44.886]  We're the good guys.
[01:08:44.886 --> 01:08:45.726]  Well, they say, hey,
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.501]  You don't bring signs.
[01:08:48.501 --> 01:08:52.963]  You know, they have the acceptable ones there on the top for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, but scroll down.
[01:08:52.963 --> 01:08:57.706]  Under there, oh, it's borderline to have an image of the Founding Fathers dumping tea in the harbor.
[01:08:57.706 --> 01:08:59.107]  Founding Fathers?
[01:08:59.107 --> 01:09:01.148]  We don't know if that's allowed.
[01:09:01.148 --> 01:09:06.511]  The sign of hope change with the image of the Statue of Liberty in trouble?
[01:09:06.511 --> 01:09:07.812]  No, can't have that.
[01:09:07.812 --> 01:09:12.495]  Can't say, uh, Obamanism with a hammer and sickle around his rising sun?
[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:18.604]  And you can't have one that says Obama lied.
[01:09:18.604 --> 01:09:20.285]  You can't have one that says impeach Obama.
[01:09:20.285 --> 01:09:21.327]  I mean, no free speech!
[01:09:21.327 --> 01:09:26.652]  So, I guess the Tea Party is an anti-free speech meeting.
[01:09:26.652 --> 01:09:31.017]  I mean, I guess it's like when you take your dog to have him neutered.
[01:09:31.017 --> 01:09:34.240]  I mean, it's legal and lawful for men.
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:38.424]  If you want to go be castrated, you can just go to the doctor and pay to have it done instead of having Glenn Beck do it for you.
[01:09:39.372 --> 01:09:47.914]  I mean, that's what Glenn Beck does, is he poses, and he's radical, and he's going to expose the FEMA camps, and he's going to expose this, and oh, they don't exist, it's kooks.
[01:09:47.914 --> 01:09:52.296]  He uses the straw man argument, and goes after what I predicted he would, the few fake stories that are out there.
[01:09:52.296 --> 01:09:59.678]  And oh, Ron Paul supporters are terrorists, and the Army needs to be used against them, and they're with McVeigh, right out of these government reports.
[01:09:59.678 --> 01:10:04.359]  I mean, that's all I do, is read these federal reports that get leaked to us and others.
[01:10:04.359 --> 01:10:08.240]  And I saw Glenn Beck years ago going off talking points out of federal documents, I mean,
[01:10:09.312 --> 01:10:12.777]  You know, I know the guy's an operative.
[01:10:12.777 --> 01:10:14.259]  And that's what they're doing.
[01:10:14.259 --> 01:10:17.864]  And again, I don't make this show about attacking another talk show host.
[01:10:17.864 --> 01:10:18.866]  Even people I can't stand.
[01:10:18.866 --> 01:10:20.488]  You know, Dianne Feinstein.
[01:10:21.377 --> 01:10:23.218]  Let's get that clip ready, the video clip.
[01:10:23.218 --> 01:10:25.278]  She came out on 60 Minutes and said, you know what?
[01:10:25.278 --> 01:10:29.740]  Last weekend, we are going to reintroduce the assault weapons ban when the time's right.
[01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:32.540]  And by the way, it's an expanded assault weapons ban.
[01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:37.002]  To actually ban them physically and make you be federally registered and shut down gun shows.
[01:10:37.002 --> 01:10:38.742]  They're going to tag all this on.
[01:10:38.742 --> 01:10:41.063]  They have done it.
[01:10:41.063 --> 01:10:43.724]  And then now, last night on 60 Minutes, they have the Mexican
[01:10:46.101 --> 01:10:50.923]  Ambassadors saying, oh, we need to ban your guns in America, because that's what's causing the problem in Mexico.
[01:10:50.923 --> 01:10:55.065]  Not drug prohibition that makes the drug gangs make so much money.
[01:10:55.065 --> 01:10:57.406]  It's not the drug war that's caused all this.
[01:10:57.406 --> 01:10:59.487]  Increase the drugs, increase the profits, all of it.
[01:10:59.487 --> 01:11:00.748]  Everybody knows that's what did it.
[01:11:00.748 --> 01:11:04.410]  Just like prohibition of alcohol did that 80 years ago.
[01:11:04.410 --> 01:11:07.311]  And it's not that Mexico has a total gun ban for citizens.
[01:11:08.697 --> 01:11:11.099]  You know, that's why Chicago's so bad, or New York's so bad.
[01:11:11.099 --> 01:11:21.390]  And then they always use those as examples of why I need to turn my guns in in Texas, because where they've got control, where the big city crime machines have control, they've disarmed everybody, so it's a hellhole.
[01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:23.932]  And they're obsessed with blaming it on us.
[01:11:23.932 --> 01:11:25.434]  Now, I said I was going to go to calls.
[01:11:25.434 --> 01:11:28.136]  I've got a lot of clips coming up I've got to get to, too.
[01:11:28.136 --> 01:11:29.377]  But, Matthew, we are changed.
[01:11:29.377 --> 01:11:31.199]  You alerted us to this last hour.
[01:11:31.199 --> 01:11:32.440]  We did confirm it's accurate.
[01:11:33.716 --> 01:11:36.939]  They're saying, you know, no Alex Jones allowed.
[01:11:36.939 --> 01:11:38.320]  We don't want Alex Jones there.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.582]  Hey, look, I don't want to be around you either.
[01:11:40.582 --> 01:11:45.586]  It's not fun to go down and confront Glenn Beck and actually look at a Benedict Arnold.
[01:11:45.586 --> 01:11:49.109]  I mean, it hurts my spirit to see
[01:11:50.427 --> 01:11:54.149]  Folks, I have to tell you, I've exposed Janet Reno and gone up against her.
[01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:56.611]  I've been arrested for asking Bush a question.
[01:11:56.611 --> 01:12:00.513]  You know, there are a few people that actually put off an aura as evil as Glenn Beck.
[01:12:00.513 --> 01:12:01.814]  It's not just all the evidence I have.
[01:12:01.814 --> 01:12:02.854]  I mean, it's my guts.
[01:12:02.854 --> 01:12:05.115]  I go, I mean, it's like a dog knows when somebody's bad.
[01:12:05.115 --> 01:12:15.922]  I'm like going, Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[01:12:21.724 --> 01:12:24.205]  They're here to co-opt our movement.
[01:12:24.205 --> 01:12:28.767]  Suddenly Fox News is worried about the New World Order after all these years saying it doesn't exist.
[01:12:28.767 --> 01:12:33.988]  And then they're begging for $35,000 on here.
[01:12:33.988 --> 01:12:41.051]  And so what you do is I guess you give them thousands of dollars and they tell you, be a good citizen, be polite, don't call for Obama's impeachment.
[01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:48.917]  It's just disgusting.
[01:12:48.917 --> 01:12:50.618]  Talking down to everyone.
[01:12:50.618 --> 01:13:08.728]  This is like, I remember in first grade when we were going to the zoo in Dallas, and for weeks before they would go, and you will hold hands when you go to the bathroom, and you will not raise your voice, and you will tie your shoelaces.
[01:13:08.728 --> 01:13:13.230]  Because we're following the nanny patriot leader.
[01:13:18.336 --> 01:13:19.138]  I mean, I can't even do it.
[01:13:19.138 --> 01:13:25.014]  You know, it's like a... I'm Glenn Beck.
[01:13:25.014 --> 01:13:25.956]  I'm your Patriot Leader.
[01:13:27.786 --> 01:13:29.167]  I mean, I can't even do it, man.
[01:13:29.167 --> 01:13:31.209]  I can't even do what the guy is.
[01:13:31.209 --> 01:13:32.810]  And it's not just that he's effeminate.
[01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:36.213]  He's that effeminate, ninny, backstabber.
[01:13:36.213 --> 01:13:37.674]  You know, the real fake.
[01:13:37.674 --> 01:13:39.596]  Oh, I care about you.
[01:13:39.596 --> 01:13:42.779]  When he does it, it's so fake, it's all about how he's getting it over on you.
[01:13:42.779 --> 01:13:48.343]  I promise I would have exposed the camps if they'd have been real, but they're not.
[01:13:48.343 --> 01:13:50.365]  These patriot types are McVeigh people.
[01:13:50.365 --> 01:13:51.506]  I'm worried about them.
[01:13:51.506 --> 01:13:53.308]  Next up, we need to attack Iran.
[01:13:53.308 --> 01:13:54.068]  Stay with me.
[01:13:54.068 --> 01:13:54.829]  I'll be right back.
[01:13:57.090 --> 01:14:02.301]  I mean, I can't even do it.
[01:14:02.301 --> 01:14:03.303]  I'm sorry.
[01:14:03.303 --> 01:14:05.067]  I'm tired of him.
[01:14:05.067 --> 01:14:06.189]  I can't look at him anymore.
[01:14:07.073 --> 01:14:07.953]  Alright, I'm going to shut up.
[01:14:07.953 --> 01:14:10.374]  Let's go back to Matthew in Texas.
[01:14:10.374 --> 01:14:13.536]  So, you dare to say you're going to bring the Obama deception?
[01:14:13.536 --> 01:14:15.096]  You know what's going to happen.
[01:14:15.096 --> 01:14:20.859]  The police on city property are going to try to say, in America, you can't hand free videos out.
[01:14:20.859 --> 01:14:23.100]  The veterans fought so you'd have no freedom.
[01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:27.362]  Travis died in the Malamo right there, so you'd have freedom to shut up!
[01:14:28.325 --> 01:14:36.050]  So there needs to be a bunch of you down there and catch it all on videotape, how they try to destroy freedom in America, and this will only blow up bigger in their face.
[01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:40.933]  The coward Beck has already said he's not going to go on stage, because I've seen video of him at other events.
[01:14:40.933 --> 01:14:47.997]  He literally looks like a dog, you know, when it's scared of thunder.
[01:14:47.997 --> 01:14:50.459]  He just, he like runs to his bodyguards.
[01:14:50.459 --> 01:14:52.200]  If anybody goes, hey Glenn Beck, what about the New World Order?
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.541]  He goes, and like runs.
[01:14:54.541 --> 01:14:57.063]  I mean, we can pull these videos up on YouTube, because
[01:14:58.885 --> 01:15:00.327]  Because he is cowardice.
[01:15:00.327 --> 01:15:01.948]  He is weakness.
[01:15:01.948 --> 01:15:03.089]  He is the New World Order.
[01:15:03.089 --> 01:15:03.470]  He is.
[01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:04.571]  That's why they like him.
[01:15:04.571 --> 01:15:06.693]  They go, man, this is a slime ball.
[01:15:06.693 --> 01:15:11.618]  And they also know that regular good people will see him and know there's something not right about that guy.
[01:15:11.618 --> 01:15:13.320]  And they know he's the new Patriot leader.
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:19.387]  He's meant to turn off everybody else and make the Patriot movement look bad, but also sucker in the dumbest.
[01:15:21.577 --> 01:15:35.887]  Alright, this show is not about Glenn Beck, but having him try to tell people that they can't be on city streets with signs, and then calling that founding father patriotism, again, it's a bait and switch.
[01:15:35.887 --> 01:15:38.689]  It's a you-know-what sandwich and I ain't taking a bite out of it.
[01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:40.990]  Alright, enough of Beck, enough of the ninny.
[01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:43.832]  But I tell you, another ninny was that James Maxey had on the show with him.
[01:15:43.832 --> 01:15:45.113]  I mean, this was like a ninny fest.
[01:15:46.783 --> 01:15:48.885]  But of course, it's cowards that serve the New World Order.
[01:15:48.885 --> 01:15:49.825]  That's what you've got to realize.
[01:15:49.825 --> 01:15:51.527]  It's cowardly, weak, scum.
[01:15:51.527 --> 01:15:56.731]  And they fool good men and women into thinking they're good, and then they use our strength to carry out the New World Order.
[01:15:56.731 --> 01:15:58.552]  Okay, Matthew, go ahead.
[01:15:58.552 --> 01:16:00.353]  And there is an upside to this, Alex.
[01:16:00.353 --> 01:16:11.942]  We were at their first meeting, um, maybe two, three weeks ago, and, um, you know, and the two or three organizers of the San Antonio Tea Party are just the biggest Glenn Beck groupies around.
[01:16:11.942 --> 01:16:13.744]  Well, they're probably state police informants.
[01:16:14.605 --> 01:16:18.168]  Uh, no, actually, they give off that vibe very much so.
[01:16:18.168 --> 01:16:30.416]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[01:16:41.226 --> 01:16:42.288]  Yeah, and I don't doubt it.
[01:16:42.288 --> 01:16:43.691]  They sent off that vibe totally.
[01:16:43.691 --> 01:16:47.117]  And at their meeting, someone asked, well, what are we going to do after the tea party?
[01:16:47.117 --> 01:16:50.724]  And I jumped in, you know, in the Fed, it's a week, two weeks after the 25th.
[01:16:51.801 --> 01:16:58.668]  And I was like, we had, at that time, we had 100 Obama Deception DVDs and 100 Fiat Empire DVDs.
[01:16:58.668 --> 01:17:00.030]  We started handing them out.
[01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:01.271]  Everybody was coming up to us.
[01:17:01.271 --> 01:17:01.992]  Oh, thank you.
[01:17:01.992 --> 01:17:03.353]  It's so good to see you guys here.
[01:17:03.353 --> 01:17:07.558]  I told one of our other younger guys, hey, it's so good to see you young people in action.
[01:17:07.558 --> 01:17:10.581]  And what website was that, InTheFed.us?
[01:17:10.581 --> 01:17:13.444]  And there was another older gentleman there, and he was like,
[01:17:13.823 --> 01:17:17.527]  You all need to go to InfoWars.com and people are like, what website is that?
[01:17:17.527 --> 01:17:19.669]  We're like, yeah, it's InfoWars.
[01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:22.613]  And what were the state police doing when you did that?
[01:17:22.613 --> 01:17:24.635]  Well, yeah, and that's what I'm building up to.
[01:17:24.635 --> 01:17:28.939]  After the meeting, the organizers pulled us aside and they were as peed off as anything.
[01:17:28.939 --> 01:17:29.660]  They were upset.
[01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:30.261]  They were telling us...
[01:17:30.768 --> 01:17:34.812]  You know, if you're going to come here doing this, send us an email, yadda yadda yadda.
[01:17:34.812 --> 01:17:37.975]  And you know, I did have about five or six end games that I handed out.
[01:17:37.975 --> 01:17:41.738]  And he was like, you're here to promote Mr. Jones, and we don't want nothing to do with that.
[01:17:41.738 --> 01:17:44.881]  I was like, hey, hey, hey, what y'all talking about ending the tax?
[01:17:44.881 --> 01:17:46.602]  To end the tax, you gotta end the Fed.
[01:17:46.602 --> 01:17:47.403]  And don't you agree?
[01:17:47.403 --> 01:17:51.026]  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, but shh, shh, shh, he was telling me, shh, shh, shh.
[01:17:51.026 --> 01:17:53.649]  I'm not against free speech, but then he's like, shh, shh, shh.
[01:17:53.649 --> 01:17:55.290]  Listen, you want to break a major story?
[01:17:55.290 --> 01:17:56.992]  Now that we've said this, they probably won't be there now.
[01:17:58.772 --> 01:18:01.754]  Follow them, just run the plates on the car.
[01:18:01.754 --> 01:18:07.658]  They think you're so dumb it's probably going to even be an unmarked when you go outside.
[01:18:07.658 --> 01:18:10.880]  Where do they have you guys meet?
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:12.501]  They have their own meetup.
[01:18:12.501 --> 01:18:15.002]  It's on meetup.com, SATParty.
[01:18:15.002 --> 01:18:17.164]  I'm a member of that meetup.
[01:18:17.164 --> 01:18:19.545]  Where do they have you meet though?
[01:18:19.545 --> 01:18:24.789]  They have meetings at a hamburger joint called the Time Machine.
[01:18:24.789 --> 01:18:25.969]  And what do the leaders look like?
[01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:30.692]  Eric Adams is one of the main organizers.
[01:18:30.692 --> 01:18:33.554]  He's the guy who's kissed Glenn Beck's hand.
[01:18:33.554 --> 01:18:36.075]  He's the guy who lobbied him to get down here.
[01:18:36.075 --> 01:18:36.556]  Now I understand.
[01:18:36.556 --> 01:18:37.976]  What's he look like?
[01:18:37.976 --> 01:18:40.338]  He's a skinny guy going bald.
[01:18:40.338 --> 01:18:41.359]  Very full of himself.
[01:18:41.359 --> 01:18:42.619]  He's just going on and on.
[01:18:42.619 --> 01:18:44.701]  It was all him that brought Glenn Beck down.
[01:18:44.701 --> 01:18:45.842]  He's a skinny guy.
[01:18:45.842 --> 01:18:47.483]  He may not be a cop then.
[01:18:47.483 --> 01:18:49.464]  Okay, what's the other one look like?
[01:18:50.846 --> 01:18:55.287]  Oh, there is one that looks like he might be a cop, big ol' pot belly.
[01:18:55.287 --> 01:19:03.110]  Well, there's usually... There'll usually be one behind the front man that'll be the operative.
[01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:17.574]  We didn't actually see any of your stereotypical bald head tattooed guys around, but if anybody did look like a... Yeah, goateed, in shape, looks like a criminal.
[01:19:17.574 --> 01:19:18.895]  That's B-A-T-F or FBI.
[01:19:21.468 --> 01:19:24.976]  Normally the types they've got infiltrating us are Army, Intelligence, or State Police.
[01:19:24.976 --> 01:19:25.818]  They'll be about 6-2, 6-3, clean cut.
[01:19:29.875 --> 01:19:39.041]  Usually they're not in super good shape, but I think if they've been on so many details out surveilling people... I mean, you can see them in Obama Deception, the guy that's following us in the parking lot.
[01:19:39.041 --> 01:19:39.901]  That's what they look like.
[01:19:39.901 --> 01:19:41.522]  They look always the same.
[01:19:41.522 --> 01:19:47.386]  But then they'll have another guys with like little mustaches and, you know, like a painter's cap, who'll play the part of the liberal.
[01:19:47.386 --> 01:19:48.767]  And then they'll be like, let's kill cops!
[01:19:48.767 --> 01:19:49.287]  Let's attack!
[01:19:49.287 --> 01:19:51.549]  And you follow them out and they got a cop car, you know, they get in.
[01:19:51.809 --> 01:19:52.971]  Alright, good job.
[01:19:52.971 --> 01:19:53.692]  Good to hear from you.
[01:19:53.692 --> 01:19:56.536]  Glad you're exposing the operations of the establishment.
[01:19:56.536 --> 01:19:58.359]  You're not going to infiltrate and take us over, okay?
[01:19:58.359 --> 01:19:59.540]  You can't stop us.
[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:00.121]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:00.121 --> 01:20:00.462]  Stay with us.
[01:20:01.616 --> 01:20:07.600]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:08.360]  Think about that.
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:11.482]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[01:20:11.482 --> 01:20:14.704]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[01:20:14.704 --> 01:20:24.490]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Chews for Health, a delicious tasting, chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables, and antioxidants.

[01:20:30.753 --> 01:20:31.933]  The choice is yours.

[01:21:02.255 --> 01:21:07.502]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:08.283 --> 01:21:14.168]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:21:14.168 --> 01:21:20.652]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:20.652 --> 01:21:22.634]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:22.634 --> 01:21:25.096]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:21:25.096 --> 01:21:35.984]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:21:38.268 --> 01:21:39.949]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:39.949 --> 01:21:41.810]  It's about a one world government.
[01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:48.712]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:23:01.806 --> 01:23:03.667]  Are you embarrassed by your legs?
[01:23:03.667 --> 01:23:05.648]  Are your legs sore and irritated?
[01:23:05.648 --> 01:23:09.090]  Millions of women suffer from leg pain due to varicose veins.

[01:23:55.862 --> 01:23:59.344]  I just can't believe the stuff a new holder comes up with, that's all.
[01:23:59.344 --> 01:24:04.506]  I mean, I can't.
[01:24:20.754 --> 01:24:26.998]  Some ninnying liar saying patriots are McVeigh bombers and we go, oh you're such a patriot we love you!
[01:24:26.998 --> 01:24:31.320]  And you can't have any free speech either, oh yes that's freedom!
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:32.141]  Which makes me sick.
[01:24:34.716 --> 01:24:37.618]  Okay, we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:37.618 --> 01:24:38.138]  Look at this.
[01:24:38.138 --> 01:24:41.120]  Gordon Brown's plan for an army of teen volunteers.
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:47.083]  Gordon Brown has vowed to make every young person do 50 hours of voluntary work by the time they reach the age of 19.
[01:24:47.083 --> 01:24:50.004]  I am actually living in 1984.
[01:24:50.004 --> 01:24:53.026]  Can you put that London Telegraph up on screen, Sharon?
[01:24:53.026 --> 01:24:55.247]  Now, what's wrong with this headline?
[01:24:55.247 --> 01:24:57.829]  Gordon Brown has vowed to make every young person do 50 hours
[01:24:59.765 --> 01:25:03.886]  Make every young person do 50 hours of voluntary work.
[01:25:03.886 --> 01:25:09.528]  Make every young person do 50 hours of voluntary work by the time they reach the age of 19.
[01:25:09.528 --> 01:25:10.428]  Make.
[01:25:10.428 --> 01:25:12.069]  Make volunteer.
[01:25:12.069 --> 01:25:13.989]  Make you volunteer.
[01:25:13.989 --> 01:25:16.010]  Make you.
[01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:20.431]  That's like, I made this woman volunteer to have sex with me.
[01:25:20.431 --> 01:25:21.411]  I mean, no, literally.
[01:25:21.411 --> 01:25:22.272]  I know, I'm sorry.
[01:25:22.272 --> 01:25:22.872]  That's what this is.
[01:25:24.841 --> 01:25:27.282]  I mean, I wonder if rapists will use that.
[01:25:27.282 --> 01:25:30.143]  Hey, I made her volunteer.
[01:25:30.143 --> 01:25:32.424]  I put a gun to her head and I made her volunteer.
[01:25:32.424 --> 01:25:37.326]  Or, I made my neighbor volunteer to sell me their house for a dollar.
[01:25:37.326 --> 01:25:44.708]  The house is worth $200,000, but I made my neighbor, by putting a .45 to their head, sell me their house for a dollar.
[01:25:44.708 --> 01:25:48.110]  How about, I made my neighbor give me the house.
[01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:51.691]  The neighbor wouldn't listen, so I shot his daughter.
[01:25:51.691 --> 01:25:53.712]  And then he gave me the house.
[01:25:55.063 --> 01:25:58.506]  Give me the house or she dies!
[01:25:58.506 --> 01:25:59.486]  Okay, see?
[01:25:59.486 --> 01:26:00.947]  I made him volunteer!
[01:26:00.947 --> 01:26:08.473]  I mean, this is 1984, folks, and notice... What's going on in England?
[01:26:08.473 --> 01:26:09.374]  What's going on in Canada?
[01:26:09.374 --> 01:26:10.134]  What's going on in Australia?
[01:26:10.134 --> 01:26:11.455]  What's going on in the United States?
[01:26:11.455 --> 01:26:20.562]  Everywhere it's, oh, in middle school, 50 hours, in high school, 100 hours, and then 18 to 25 compulsory military disaster training and fatigues at military bases.
[01:26:21.673 --> 01:26:23.454]  And they go, uh, the bill's introduced.
[01:26:23.454 --> 01:26:23.834]  Shut up!
[01:26:23.834 --> 01:26:24.995]  It doesn't exist, Alex!
[01:26:24.995 --> 01:26:26.856]  Well, uh, here's five different bills.
[01:26:26.856 --> 01:26:27.096]  H.R.
[01:26:27.096 --> 01:26:30.678]  444 and others.
[01:26:30.678 --> 01:26:33.559]  And the left is like, well, maybe we need compulsory service.
[01:26:33.559 --> 01:26:35.420]  Al-Qaeda did hit us hard.
[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:36.961]  But it's only volunteering!
[01:26:36.961 --> 01:26:38.702]  They only make you volunteer!
[01:26:38.702 --> 01:26:40.562]  They only make you put a uniform on!
[01:26:40.562 --> 01:26:43.424]  It's volunteering!
[01:26:43.424 --> 01:26:44.765]  You know, I said I'd take your calls.
[01:26:46.021 --> 01:26:48.203]  But Forrest hung up and Debbie and everybody else.
[01:26:48.203 --> 01:26:48.884]  You know what?
[01:26:48.884 --> 01:26:50.705]  Maybe I should never take calls anymore.
[01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:53.848]  Because I can't get to all this news.
[01:26:53.848 --> 01:27:01.034]  I have this huge mega-viral story going everywhere about bird flu, but everybody's ignoring all the real bird flu news.
[01:27:02.323 --> 01:27:09.385]  I have this federal report where they're saying gun owners are terrorists and the feds are getting ready to come after us and that free speech may not be free speech.
[01:27:09.385 --> 01:27:15.686]  I've got all this eugenics news here and I want to go to your calls but I got Naomi Wolf coming up and then Joe Bannister.
[01:27:15.686 --> 01:27:17.827]  I'll have no time to play these clips if I don't go to them.
[01:27:17.827 --> 01:27:18.267]  Doesn't matter.
[01:27:18.267 --> 01:27:23.008]  Let's go to a few more here.
[01:27:23.008 --> 01:27:25.369]  Let's talk to Zach in Texas and Dustin in Germany.
[01:27:25.369 --> 01:27:26.149]  I'll at least get to them.
[01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.469]  Go ahead.
[01:27:27.671 --> 01:27:30.132]  Hey Alex, this is Zach in Houston.
[01:27:30.132 --> 01:27:30.552]  Hello, sir.
[01:27:30.552 --> 01:27:37.754]  I wanted to talk to you about KHOU Channel 11 here in the Houston area.
[01:27:37.754 --> 01:27:41.315]  Like three weeks ago, I was up in the morning about 6 a.m.
[01:27:41.315 --> 01:27:54.739]  getting ready to go to work, and they made an announcement that said the Texas City Refinery, that's where I live, will be releasing extra amounts of sulfur dioxide into the air due to a pressure problem, and that
[01:27:55.515 --> 01:27:58.856]  It would affect people with allergies that day.
[01:27:58.856 --> 01:28:04.479]  And I would never pay to know mine until I heard that person on your show last week talking about sulfur dioxide.
[01:28:04.479 --> 01:28:06.579]  Yeah, that's in the official government reports.
[01:28:06.579 --> 01:28:16.003]  They're spraying us with sulfur dioxide, aluminum, barium, salts, and other things that attack your body.
[01:28:16.003 --> 01:28:21.925]  Okay, and so basically another question I had about that is I have an outdoor garden, all organic and everything.
[01:28:21.925 --> 01:28:23.466]  Do you think that crap is affecting it?
[01:28:25.543 --> 01:28:31.468]  Well, I mean, I've seen the statistics in living in Houston or surrounding areas.
[01:28:31.468 --> 01:28:35.351]  So many decades of toxic waste being dumped, buried homes.
[01:28:35.351 --> 01:28:41.736]  You know, the oil companies and chemical companies, a lot of the housing developments were built on oil company land where they had refineries.
[01:28:41.736 --> 01:28:45.559]  And so that's why the cancer rates off the chart in Houston.
[01:28:45.559 --> 01:28:47.921]  I know folks have to live there for the work and I got family lives down there.
[01:28:48.601 --> 01:28:53.283]  But I remember being a little kid, driving in the car from Dallas, and I'd say, oh, we're in Houston, my eyes are burning.
[01:28:53.283 --> 01:28:54.764]  And the stink.
[01:28:54.764 --> 01:28:58.686]  And, uh, I mean, I wouldn't live anywhere near Houston if I had a choice.
[01:28:58.686 --> 01:29:02.968]  I mean, those chemical plants, all of it, it is so bad.
[01:29:02.968 --> 01:29:05.469]  I mean, that's a real environmental problem.
[01:29:05.469 --> 01:29:08.671]  And certainly, you know, none of that's good for your plants.
[01:29:08.671 --> 01:29:09.791]  Okay, one more thing.
[01:29:09.791 --> 01:29:17.195]  Also on KHOU this week, which is Channel 11 here in Houston, they're doing an expose on, it had to be,
[01:29:17.924 --> 01:29:19.907]  I don't know where they got the video
[01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:37.134]  But, uh, it's definitely something from, uh, like one of your listeners or something, I would say.
[01:29:37.134 --> 01:29:40.557]  I bet my bottom dollar, though, they're gonna do a straw man.
[01:29:40.557 --> 01:29:46.942]  They're gonna show the new vaults being built for all the veterans that are dying that are real and legitimate, and mix it in with the plastic coffins.
[01:29:46.942 --> 01:29:48.303]  Hey, the debate's over.
[01:29:48.303 --> 01:29:49.544]  I have the federal documents.
[01:29:49.544 --> 01:29:51.886]  They're building mass graves.
[01:29:51.886 --> 01:29:53.287]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.287 --> 01:29:55.829]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.829 --> 01:29:58.491]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.795 --> 01:30:07.608]  How would you like to finally be debt free without paying another cent to creditors and not have to file bankruptcy?
[01:30:09.650 --> 01:30:10.190]  We're good to go.
[01:30:32.049 --> 01:30:32.489]  We're good to go.
[01:31:02.193 --> 01:31:08.019]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:08.019 --> 01:31:14.987]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:31:15.589 --> 01:31:22.172]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:22.172 --> 01:31:24.133]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:24.133 --> 01:31:26.635]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:26.635 --> 01:31:38.220]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:39.901]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:39.901 --> 01:31:41.242]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:48.658]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:31:56.927 --> 01:31:58.509]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:58.509 --> 01:31:59.691]  The people strike back.
[01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:04.671]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:32:04.671 --> 01:32:09.493]  You might not be able to spell Constitution, but you sure know how important it is.
[01:32:09.493 --> 01:32:15.635]  You might not be missing any shirts from your closet, but you have given the shirt off your back hundreds of times.
[01:32:15.635 --> 01:32:20.938]  You might not understand the thousands of laws that exist, but you do live by the Ten Commandments.
[01:32:20.938 --> 01:32:23.819]  You might not know who the bad guys are, or what you should be
[01:32:23.899 --> 01:32:24.560]  I think so.
[01:32:39.276 --> 01:32:40.936]  E-FoodsDirect.com.
[01:32:40.936 --> 01:32:45.177]  You might not be able to own a farm, but you can have the food that came from one.
[01:32:45.177 --> 01:32:48.478]  E-FoodsDirect.com, 800-409-5633.
[01:32:48.478 --> 01:32:54.139]  We're thankful for the chance to lend a hand with food for you and your family.
[01:32:54.139 --> 01:32:56.400]  On the web, E-FoodsDirect.com, or call 800-409-5633.
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:57.780]  Body unions are big businessmen,
[01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:09.129]  Okay.
[01:33:09.129 --> 01:33:13.312]  I gotta get into this.
[01:33:13.312 --> 01:33:14.012]  Homeland Security.
[01:33:14.012 --> 01:33:16.674]  I called Homeland Security.
[01:33:16.674 --> 01:33:18.095]  This is their federal report.
[01:33:18.095 --> 01:33:19.596]  Put out April 7th.
[01:33:39.785 --> 01:33:43.806]  And it says, basically, gun owners are terrorists.
[01:33:43.806 --> 01:33:46.686]  So I'm going to go over this.
[01:33:46.686 --> 01:33:52.928]  But first, I'm going to get into the latest internet hysteria out there.
[01:33:52.928 --> 01:33:56.969]  And we're going to go to that in a moment.
[01:33:56.969 --> 01:34:08.431]  The first thing, the first issue I need to cover is that you have these burial vaults all over the country being radically expanded at federal cemeteries.
[01:34:09.881 --> 01:34:14.485]  Massive increases.
[01:34:14.485 --> 01:34:22.271]  And they talk about 700 plus thousand, World War II, Korean War vets are scheduled, you know, on average, to die this year.
[01:34:22.271 --> 01:34:24.933]  And I looked that number up, it's accurate.
[01:34:24.933 --> 01:34:30.738]  And they have suddenly changed the vaults where they put them side by side and put four coffins in each vault.
[01:34:30.738 --> 01:34:33.200]  Stacking them on each other like they do in Europe.
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:35.302]  So I can buy that.
[01:34:35.302 --> 01:34:35.582]  But,
[01:34:38.297 --> 01:34:50.607]  Then the Feds come out, I had to pick this up off the floor, then the Feds come out and say there's no plans for mass graves and incinerators, it's all lies, and say that the plastic FEMA coffins are made up.
[01:34:50.607 --> 01:34:58.234]  When those are confirmed and the company that sells them to the government confirms, millions and millions of these plastic coffins in Georgia and Colorado are out there.
[01:34:58.234 --> 01:35:05.660]  And I have the Rocky Mountain News, big paper in Colorado, Jim Erickson, Rocky Mountain News, February 8, 2003.
[01:35:07.549 --> 01:35:09.771]  Article titled, State Prepares for Bioterrorism.
[01:35:09.771 --> 01:35:13.616]  It says, Executive Order signed for mass graves and incinerators.
[01:35:13.616 --> 01:35:19.001]  Dig mass graves under executive orders drafted for the event of bioterrorism attack.
[01:35:19.001 --> 01:35:24.207]  Cremate disease ridden, cremate disease ridden corpses and dig mass graves.
[01:35:24.207 --> 01:35:25.789]  And then it goes through the executive order.
[01:35:27.637 --> 01:35:29.118]  For a pandemic.
[01:35:29.118 --> 01:35:30.740]  So, there's the Rocky Mountain News.
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:32.061]  You can just Google that.
[01:35:32.061 --> 01:35:33.622]  It's mainstream news.
[01:35:33.622 --> 01:35:34.743]  Mass graves repaired for U.S.
[01:35:34.743 --> 01:35:36.625]  citizens.
[01:35:36.625 --> 01:35:38.286]  State repairs for bioterrorism.
[01:35:38.286 --> 01:35:39.927]  Okay.
[01:35:39.927 --> 01:35:43.170]  Here is the State of New York Department of State Division Cemeteries.
[01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:44.851]  This is posted on Infowars.com.
[01:35:44.851 --> 01:35:46.173]  You can call these phone numbers.
[01:35:46.173 --> 01:35:47.614]  This went out all over the country.
[01:35:47.614 --> 01:35:51.637]  They've been asked to get ready for a bird flu or other pandemic to kill millions.
[01:35:51.637 --> 01:35:53.639]  And how many bodies can they bury per acre?
[01:35:54.898 --> 01:35:59.381]  And is each cemetery ready to bury tens of thousands on their extra acreage?
[01:35:59.381 --> 01:36:02.703]  Now, that's from the state of New York right there, and I covered this last week.
[01:36:02.703 --> 01:36:06.446]  So... What does the media do, though?
[01:36:06.446 --> 01:36:12.810]  They go out in Phoenix and everywhere else and go, Oh, this is just a VA National Cemetery for the dead.
[01:36:12.810 --> 01:36:14.671]  It's no big deal.
[01:36:14.671 --> 01:36:21.836]  But in truth, we have confirmed they've been contacted and are preparing for more dead troops from combat, not just troops that are dying who are veterans.
[01:36:22.895 --> 01:36:24.896]  You know, veterans who've grown old and are dying.
[01:36:24.896 --> 01:36:33.581]  So that's how they do the straw man, and that's the problem with all of this, is people don't go to the real documentation, they go to speculation.
[01:36:38.549 --> 01:36:44.854]  I guess a week and a half ago or something, one of the Genesis shows, a nice show, Joyce Reilly's show, here on Genesis.
[01:36:44.854 --> 01:36:46.956]  I'm not criticizing her, but I want to make that clear.
[01:36:46.956 --> 01:36:52.201]  A caller calls in, and if you really listen to what the lady's saying, it's all craziness.
[01:36:52.201 --> 01:36:59.527]  I mean, all I do is study how this stuff really operates, what really goes on, and what the real threats are, and I know baloney when I hear it.
[01:37:00.922 --> 01:37:02.423]  Now, what's real?
[01:37:02.423 --> 01:37:04.284]  This is just what I printed up this morning.
[01:37:04.284 --> 01:37:07.326]  Homeless people died after bird flu vaccine trial in Poland.
[01:37:07.326 --> 01:37:08.126]  Live bird flu.
[01:37:08.126 --> 01:37:14.330]  Pharmaceutical companies paid homeless centers to tell them it was just a normal flu shot and it killed them better than a hammer.
[01:37:14.330 --> 01:37:16.451]  23 died at one homeless facility.
[01:37:16.451 --> 01:37:17.972]  21 people died at one homeless center.
[01:37:17.972 --> 01:37:19.013]  Died alone.
[01:37:19.013 --> 01:37:20.454]  And that's London Telegraph.
[01:37:21.451 --> 01:37:21.811]  Right there?
[01:37:21.811 --> 01:37:24.673]  I mean, you can Google people die from bird flu vaccine.
[01:37:24.673 --> 01:37:26.015]  You'll get hundreds of articles.
[01:37:26.015 --> 01:37:26.935]  So there's that.
[01:37:26.935 --> 01:37:27.616]  Here's another one.
[01:37:27.616 --> 01:37:30.238]  AFP, Health Workers Agency, French Press.
[01:37:30.238 --> 01:37:32.860]  Health workers on trial for vaccine scam in Poland.
[01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:39.044]  Nine health workers went on trial in northern Poland Monday, accused of having tested a vaccine against bird flu in nearly 200 patients without their knowledge.
[01:37:39.044 --> 01:37:40.365]  Court officials said.
[01:37:40.365 --> 01:37:40.886]  And it goes on.
[01:37:41.983 --> 01:37:50.026]  Now, remember Baxter Pharmaceutical, 18 countries, ships out live bird flu, the stuff that kills humans, but not airborne yet.
[01:37:50.026 --> 01:37:59.410]  They order the companies, the sub-companies, without telling them what it is, to mix it with multi-strains of real human bird flu.
[01:37:59.410 --> 01:38:03.271]  Of regular human flu with the bird flu that humans can catch.
[01:38:03.271 --> 01:38:10.834]  And that's how, the exact way, scientists and firms that looked at this in major newspapers, you know, Bloomberg, Toronto Star,
[01:38:12.435 --> 01:38:21.364]  Canadian free press, all the big check papers, big checkerboard papers said, had scientists going, this is exactly how you'd mutate bird flu.
[01:38:21.364 --> 01:38:25.448]  This had to be done by design.
[01:38:25.448 --> 01:38:28.471]  Now, there's no discussion of where that vaccine material went.
[01:38:28.471 --> 01:38:32.175]  They just say it was shipped out.
[01:38:32.175 --> 01:38:33.136]  And then you got these deaths.
[01:38:34.775 --> 01:38:38.976]  Now that, ladies and gentlemen, is something that's serious and needs to be looked at.
[01:38:38.976 --> 01:38:54.541]  And so I don't blame people for getting hysterical when all of this, you know, you have a history of a government over and over and over again that's totally criminal, eugenics, calling for a reduction of population of more than 50%, upwards of 90% in some documents.
[01:38:54.541 --> 01:38:58.542]  That's in the mainstream news today with government officials saying that.
[01:38:58.542 --> 01:39:01.103]  You have all of this happening, all of this unfolding.
[01:39:06.374 --> 01:39:08.636]  So, yes, people are going to get upset.
[01:39:08.636 --> 01:39:10.358]  People are going to hear this.
[01:39:10.358 --> 01:39:13.020]  Truck drivers are going to get upset.
[01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:19.186]  You know, people are going to start getting hysterical.
[01:39:19.186 --> 01:39:22.209]  And then the media is going to focus in on the issues that aren't real.
[01:39:22.209 --> 01:39:25.231]  You know, this should have been top national news.
[01:39:25.231 --> 01:39:26.292]  Where is the vaccine?
[01:39:26.292 --> 01:39:28.715]  Where was the live bird flu vaccine shipped to?
[01:39:28.715 --> 01:39:29.756]  What's going on with it?
[01:39:29.756 --> 01:39:30.776]  Baxter is a U.S.
[01:39:30.776 --> 01:39:31.117]  company.
[01:39:35.011 --> 01:39:37.072]  But I know how governments operate.
[01:39:37.072 --> 01:39:46.297]  I know they don't get random truck drivers and then tell them what they're carrying and then tell them we're going to pay you in cash and we're going to give you injections and you're going to go down silos and bring this up.
[01:39:46.297 --> 01:39:49.239]  You know, just the whole thing, the way it comes together.
[01:39:49.239 --> 01:39:56.283]  And then people grab that audio and put video of running up to a train stopped on the side of the road like it's Blair Witch Project.
[01:39:57.083 --> 01:40:01.726]  Breathing heavily, and they jump on board open container cars.
[01:40:01.726 --> 01:40:03.527]  Half the trains out there are empty.
[01:40:03.527 --> 01:40:05.729]  They dump their load, they go back.
[01:40:05.729 --> 01:40:16.436]  But, you know, just some shaky camera work of cargo trains, empty, is then the total proof and the hysteria then ensues.
[01:40:16.436 --> 01:40:19.458]  And Glenn Beck and people will go get things like this news story.
[01:40:20.677 --> 01:40:24.819]  Linda Thompson putting out fake flames shooting out of the tank at Waco.
[01:40:24.819 --> 01:40:30.261]  The media focused on that instead of the flare footage and the Delta Force admitting they went there and murdered everybody.
[01:40:30.261 --> 01:40:34.242]  And Time and Newsweek admitting there were troops there and even foreign troops.
[01:40:34.242 --> 01:40:35.983]  Ignore all that real stuff.
[01:40:35.983 --> 01:40:39.104]  Let's focus on Linda Thompson's fake video.
[01:40:39.104 --> 01:40:42.085]  Then she puts out a fake video of a train repair shop.
[01:40:42.085 --> 01:40:43.286]  I knew Beck was going to go with that.
[01:40:43.286 --> 01:40:43.946]  It was not hard.
[01:40:47.344 --> 01:40:51.005]  So, this is how they try to discredit us, and this is what they do.
[01:40:51.005 --> 01:40:55.046]  Let's go ahead and play a few minutes of this show from a Genesis show.
[01:40:55.046 --> 01:40:55.646]  The Power Hour.
[01:40:55.646 --> 01:40:57.386]  Here it is.
[01:40:57.386 --> 01:40:59.927]  I'm calling because I'm very concerned.
[01:40:59.927 --> 01:41:04.527]  We have some actual proof that a trucker may actually be transporting bird flu.
[01:41:04.527 --> 01:41:05.928]  Stop right there.
[01:41:05.928 --> 01:41:08.568]  Back that up.
[01:41:08.568 --> 01:41:14.890]  We may actually... We have proof that a trucker may actually be.
[01:41:14.890 --> 01:41:16.450]  That's kind of like this headline.
[01:41:17.628 --> 01:41:28.878]  I was reading here earlier, Gordon Brown has vowed to make every young person do 50 hours of volunteer work to make you, and then you read what he's introducing, force compulsory national service.
[01:41:28.878 --> 01:41:31.059]  It's a lot more than 50 hours.
[01:41:31.059 --> 01:41:33.702]  That's just how they started.
[01:41:33.702 --> 01:41:39.166]  So see, listen to that clip again carefully.
[01:41:39.166 --> 01:41:42.249]  We have proof that he may actually, may be, listen.
[01:41:43.650 --> 01:41:46.175]  I'm calling because I'm very concerned.
[01:41:46.175 --> 01:41:51.804]  We have some actual proof that a trucker may actually be transporting bird food.
[01:41:51.804 --> 01:41:53.507]  Stop again!
[01:41:53.507 --> 01:41:55.931]  We have proof?
[01:41:55.931 --> 01:41:57.033]  That he may be actually?
[01:42:03.325 --> 01:42:11.091]  But I mean, meanwhile, they admit that it came out four years ago that weaponized bird flu crashed in a car wreck with FedEx.
[01:42:11.091 --> 01:42:12.772]  It was in the Associated Press.
[01:42:12.772 --> 01:42:14.233]  Nobody cared.
[01:42:14.233 --> 01:42:27.883]  You have real bird flu being mailed out to over 5,000 locations then, and then they mail it out to all these locations in Europe, Baxter does, and have it mixed with it, but there's no hysteria, no freaking out, no Google videos, no YouTube videos, because it's documented!
[01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:35.041]  See, I mean, I don't understand it.
[01:42:35.041 --> 01:42:41.865]  There's all these videos with tens of millions of views of fake FEMA stuff, but none of all the real things.
[01:42:41.865 --> 01:42:44.046]  Go ahead and finish up with it.
[01:42:44.046 --> 01:43:01.375]  We have a federal agent who is aware, who has taken the documents to many agencies, including New York State Police, the FBI, in many, many states, infections control, disease, and what this trucker reported was that he works for Department of Homeland Security,
[01:43:02.531 --> 01:43:06.573]  He's a Spanish man who is trucking an independent truck.
[01:43:06.573 --> 01:43:15.698]  He goes down to the corner of Broadway and Clinton and Albany, New York at the Department of Homeland Security facility every single evening for loads.
[01:43:15.698 --> 01:43:17.919]  He said there are Raymond Flanagan's and J.B.
[01:43:17.919 --> 01:43:24.082]  Hunt trucks ahead of him loading, that he has taken loads from a silo above Glen Falls.
[01:43:24.082 --> 01:43:26.624]  His truck actually was lowered into the ground into a silo.
[01:43:26.624 --> 01:43:27.824]  Yeah, let's stop right there.
[01:43:27.824 --> 01:43:29.245]  Let's stop right there.
[01:43:32.705 --> 01:43:36.668]  She later says it's missiles.
[01:43:36.668 --> 01:43:45.733]  So he's in silos getting fresh bird flu, but you listen to the whole tape, never is there any proof of bird flu.
[01:43:45.733 --> 01:43:55.760]  And then they're down in the missile silos, and the missiles, and then it's being trucked around, and then they pay him cash, and they go to windows to get their money, and they go in back rooms.
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:57.921]  It's not how the government operates.
[01:43:57.921 --> 01:43:58.662]  Just keep playing it.
[01:44:02.637 --> 01:44:10.242]  By the way, stop there.
[01:44:10.242 --> 01:44:10.663]  Stop there.
[01:44:10.663 --> 01:44:15.045]  I mean, I was watching, you know, a lot of our programs about the history of trucking.
[01:44:15.045 --> 01:44:16.867]  They have federal lines.
[01:44:16.867 --> 01:44:22.270]  They have federal lines that carry nukes, carry bio, carry everything.
[01:44:22.270 --> 01:44:24.512]  It's all government-run.
[01:44:24.512 --> 01:44:26.213]  But I mean, listen to this.
[01:44:26.213 --> 01:44:27.394]  This hysteria.
[01:44:27.394 --> 01:44:27.894]  Go back to it.
[01:44:31.139 --> 01:44:41.468]  He was told that he told the federal investigator how he's getting paid through the Bank of America with a number.
[01:44:41.468 --> 01:44:43.670]  He walks up to a window.
[01:44:43.670 --> 01:44:45.251]  He presents his number.
[01:44:45.251 --> 01:44:47.654]  He is taken to a back room and paid in cash.
[01:44:47.654 --> 01:44:54.740]  He showed the federal agent $100,000 worth of receipts because he gets $5,000 per load, and he's done as many as three loads per day.
[01:44:55.060 --> 01:44:59.341]  Okay, now wait, let me just stop you right here because this is amazing information to say the least.
[01:44:59.341 --> 01:45:04.742]  Now, perhaps he is transporting vaccines, refrigerated vaccines.
[01:45:04.742 --> 01:45:06.322]  Is that a possibility?
[01:45:06.322 --> 01:45:09.983]  Anything that has to be iced either has to be an antigen or an antibody.
[01:45:09.983 --> 01:45:11.103]  That's all we know.
[01:45:11.103 --> 01:45:19.744]  But we know that they gave him a shot to transport it, that they told him it was to protect his family, that it is obviously something that has to be kept refrigerated.
[01:45:19.744 --> 01:45:23.825]  He did one load for a complete week to Tucson, Arizona and back.
[01:45:24.005 --> 01:45:29.549]  But the amount of money that they're paying him under the table through Bank of America, only loading at night.
[01:45:29.549 --> 01:45:34.533]  They called him and they asked him to come down to meetings at Department of Homeland Security at 3 o'clock in the morning.
[01:45:34.533 --> 01:45:38.156]  They'll ask him how he's doing and send him back home and say, fine, you're okay, go back home.
[01:45:38.857 --> 01:45:40.559]  He has other truckers.
[01:45:40.559 --> 01:45:45.504]  He knows of a trucker with a 53-foot bed unit that took a missile type.
[01:45:45.504 --> 01:45:49.489]  He was able to see his load, and that was taken out to Phoenix, Arizona.
[01:45:49.489 --> 01:45:53.913]  He was given $18,000 to truck that load two times.
[01:45:53.913 --> 01:45:56.817]  It was 80 tons, and he blew his brakes.
[01:45:56.817 --> 01:45:58.639]  The Department of Homeland Security took care of it.
[01:45:59.439 --> 01:46:02.341]  He also has been to two silos.
[01:46:02.341 --> 01:46:04.522]  He's been to many cities with his loads.
[01:46:04.522 --> 01:46:13.587]  He's continuously working for Department of Homeland Security and they are relocating him since the federal agents and the state police were notified.
[01:46:13.587 --> 01:46:19.050]  We were notified that he is being relocated to Tucson, Arizona at a base 15 miles below Tucson.
[01:46:19.050 --> 01:46:23.253]  Let me just ask you, Mary, how did you come upon this information?
[01:46:23.913 --> 01:46:26.555]  Um, I can't say.
[01:46:26.555 --> 01:46:29.196]  I mean, just what I'm saying already has probably put me in danger.
[01:46:29.196 --> 01:46:32.738]  Look, I can't play any more of it.
[01:46:32.738 --> 01:46:34.099]  I can't listen to it.
[01:46:34.099 --> 01:46:36.901]  Folks, it just gets more whacked out from there.
[01:46:36.901 --> 01:46:39.122]  Again, the news.
[01:46:39.122 --> 01:46:41.824]  Health workers on trial for vaccine scam in Poland.
[01:46:41.824 --> 01:46:43.605]  Bird flu injections.
[01:46:43.605 --> 01:46:45.846]  Homeless people die after bird flu vaccine trial.
[01:46:45.846 --> 01:46:47.507]  Now that's mainstream news.
[01:46:50.256 --> 01:46:57.117]  And then the video ends with people hysterically running up to a train with it shaking everywhere and it's just an empty train.
[01:46:57.117 --> 01:46:58.638]  I mean, there's train tracks all around here.
[01:46:58.638 --> 01:47:03.239]  The trains, you know, half of them are full going one direction, the other half are empty going the other direction.
[01:47:03.239 --> 01:47:06.299]  I guess I could run up hyperventilating and shoot video of a train.
[01:47:06.299 --> 01:47:09.640]  And again, I'm not blaming people for picking up on this.
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:13.581]  This is what happens when the general public wakes up but doesn't have the deep discernment yet.
[01:47:13.581 --> 01:47:14.401]  This is what happens.
[01:47:16.363 --> 01:47:19.485]  Because the government has tested chemical, biologicals, radiologicals.
[01:47:19.485 --> 01:47:23.267]  They have carried out the Tuskegee experiment and all the other things people know about.
[01:47:23.267 --> 01:47:28.049]  There is some weird stuff going on with bird flu.
[01:47:28.049 --> 01:47:31.811]  But they just ship it around in FedEx trucks.
[01:47:31.811 --> 01:47:35.973]  And then when it's nukes and actual bioweapons and things, they ship them on government lines.
[01:47:35.973 --> 01:47:39.755]  Government-contracted lines.
[01:47:39.755 --> 01:47:42.097]  And it's just done nonchalantly.
[01:47:42.861 --> 01:47:49.731]  But to say refrigerated stuff out of missile silos to other missile silos?
[01:47:49.731 --> 01:47:54.678]  And then he, he had a missile, and then he saw it!
[01:47:54.678 --> 01:47:55.819]  I mean, you listen to that, folks.
[01:47:55.819 --> 01:47:57.161]  I've heard it a million times.
[01:47:57.161 --> 01:47:58.863]  I know bull when I hear it.
[01:47:59.394 --> 01:48:03.996]  And I'd stake my right arm that this is the biggest load of malarkey I've ever heard in my life.
[01:48:03.996 --> 01:48:09.617]  Now, again, I could take a crazy call like that, and I would certainly entertain it.
[01:48:09.617 --> 01:48:12.078]  I'm not blaming anybody for that.
[01:48:12.078 --> 01:48:17.520]  And I don't blame listeners and people out there for posting the videos and asking people about it.
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:21.441]  But you asked me what I thought of it, folks, and I've told you now.
[01:48:21.441 --> 01:48:22.902]  And it just goes on and on from there.
[01:48:25.188 --> 01:48:33.296]  About how he's in the witness protection program now and the feds don't want people to know and... It's just unbelievable.
[01:48:33.296 --> 01:48:37.960]  Meanwhile, no one is going to talk about how they're doing bird flu trials that are killing people.
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:43.385]  Nobody's going to talk about where are the 18 countries flu vaccines they mix with bird flu.
[01:48:43.385 --> 01:48:44.727]  Nobody's going to talk about that.
[01:48:44.727 --> 01:48:45.848]  That's not what's important.
[01:48:45.848 --> 01:48:47.049]  That's not a big deal.
[01:48:47.049 --> 01:48:50.012]  Confirmed people being injected and dying.
[01:48:51.129 --> 01:48:56.452]  Or HPV being injected in schoolgirls and them dying all over the country and all over the world.
[01:48:56.452 --> 01:48:58.233]  Or how they want to force boys to take it.
[01:48:58.233 --> 01:49:14.280]  See, in the in plain view, some African countries with 46% of the women dying of HIV, Bayer knowingly shipping out over a million ampules with Baxter, that has the bird flu being shipped out, with their vaccines filled with live HIV and hepatitis.
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:16.161]  Oh, that's, we don't want to hear about that!
[01:49:16.161 --> 01:49:19.043]  We want to run up to a train, hyperventilating, going,
[01:49:20.930 --> 01:49:22.833]  I mean, show that video at the very end.
[01:49:22.833 --> 01:49:24.034]  Cue it up to the last minute.
[01:49:24.034 --> 01:49:26.698]  Show that to folks on that video.
[01:49:26.698 --> 01:49:27.039]  Here it is.
[01:49:45.644 --> 01:49:48.645]  You don't need shackles and benches when you think about it.
[01:49:48.645 --> 01:49:50.326]  Because, who gives a shit?
[01:49:50.326 --> 01:49:52.186]  Why would we put it in an oven?
[01:49:52.186 --> 01:49:54.487]  Oops, I think somebody took a longer clip.
[01:49:54.487 --> 01:49:58.869]  I've actually seen one that didn't have that in it.
[01:49:58.869 --> 01:50:00.569]  Anyways, just don't play the audio.
[01:50:00.569 --> 01:50:01.990]  I apologize for that, folks.
[01:50:01.990 --> 01:50:02.890]  I saw a different clip.
[01:50:02.890 --> 01:50:05.031]  I guess they've added something to the end of it.
[01:50:05.031 --> 01:50:08.832]  But I mean, he just runs up and shows an empty train.
[01:50:08.832 --> 01:50:11.853]  And then Glenn Beck will show this and say, we made it up.
[01:50:13.055 --> 01:50:14.556]  And that's how the video ends.
[01:50:14.556 --> 01:50:19.520]  So this is how the hysteria and the insaneness to where people don't know what's true anymore.
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:20.581]  Can you guys play without the audio?
[01:50:20.581 --> 01:50:23.804]  I just want folks to see the proof.
[01:50:23.804 --> 01:50:26.586]  I mean, what does this have to do with bird flu and silos?
[01:50:34.946 --> 01:50:36.227]  And it goes on and on.
[01:50:36.227 --> 01:50:40.891]  I mean, this is the footage shot, Blair Witch style, on purpose.
[01:50:40.891 --> 01:50:43.213]  Water all over the lens.
[01:50:43.213 --> 01:50:46.176]  This is a psyop, folks.
[01:50:46.176 --> 01:50:50.299]  And then he runs up into a train.
[01:50:50.299 --> 01:50:54.623]  And it's a Union Pacific train just sitting there waiting to go to a factory to be loaded.
[01:50:56.397 --> 01:51:01.819]  I mean, you know, but... Meanwhile, we've got all the real stuff going on in plain view and nobody cares.
[01:51:01.819 --> 01:51:03.779]  Gardeners, you have the seeds.

[01:51:37.389 --> 01:51:38.590]  You have the seeds.

[01:52:02.344 --> 01:52:07.592]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:08.377 --> 01:52:14.262]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:14.262 --> 01:52:20.767]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:20.767 --> 01:52:22.749]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:22.749 --> 01:52:25.211]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:25.211 --> 01:52:36.100]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:38.371 --> 01:52:40.052]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:40.052 --> 01:52:41.913]  It's about a one world government.
[01:52:41.913 --> 01:52:48.816]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:52:57.080 --> 01:52:58.661]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:58.661 --> 01:52:59.842]  The people strike back.
[01:53:01.952 --> 01:53:03.953]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:53:03.953 --> 01:53:10.915]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:53:10.915 --> 01:53:19.317]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:53:19.317 --> 01:53:25.039]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:53:25.199 --> 01:53:27.040]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:29.221]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:53:29.221 --> 01:53:33.764]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:53:33.764 --> 01:53:35.985]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:53:35.985 --> 01:53:43.029]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:53:44.428 --> 01:53:46.770]  Earlier in the show, I mentioned how Newsweek reported that Russians
[01:54:12.955 --> 01:54:21.520]  We're in Waco with a quote, white noise machine and some subliminal machine, some mind control system.
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:26.402]  And then Tim, who works here in the office, comes back and goes, look what we just got in the mail.
[01:54:26.402 --> 01:54:27.723]  I had this years ago.
[01:54:27.723 --> 01:54:29.284]  This is from 1994.
[01:54:29.284 --> 01:54:31.725]  Beyond Prozac is the cover story.
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:37.461]  And, uh, February 7th, 1994, and it talks about the Russians and mind control.
[01:54:37.461 --> 01:54:42.463]  The techniques used include transmissions that could have convinced Koresh he was hearing the voice of God inside his head.
[01:54:42.463 --> 01:54:48.644]  The Air Force offered a top-secret non-lethal system, and it goes on.
[01:54:48.644 --> 01:54:53.546]  And it describes it on a bunch of the pages in here.
[01:54:53.546 --> 01:54:54.526]  So this is interesting.
[01:54:54.526 --> 01:54:57.527]  I want to thank the listener that sent us this.
[01:54:58.956 --> 01:55:01.097]  Because I had that years ago and lost it.
[01:55:01.097 --> 01:55:02.997]  Now it goes back into the pile.
[01:55:02.997 --> 01:55:11.060]  But, uh, look, I don't like policing what people say and do here on air.
[01:55:11.060 --> 01:55:18.723]  It's just when I get hundreds and hundreds of emails and phone calls going, oh my God, run to the hills, they're releasing bird flu.
[01:55:18.723 --> 01:55:21.244]  I go, wait a minute.
[01:55:21.244 --> 01:55:22.464]  You might want to run to the hills.
[01:55:22.464 --> 01:55:26.045]  I mean, I've actually thought about moving to the country because stuff's getting so crazy.
[01:55:26.045 --> 01:55:27.786]  In the event something like this happens,
[01:55:30.174 --> 01:55:36.096]  Because... I mean, they are shipping bird flu around the world.
[01:55:36.096 --> 01:55:37.956]  They are shooting people up with it.
[01:55:37.956 --> 01:55:39.497]  People are dying!
[01:55:39.497 --> 01:55:40.817]  And that's mainstream news!
[01:55:40.817 --> 01:55:47.859]  And then I post mainstream news and then people... the news calls me bad for even reporting on it.
[01:55:47.859 --> 01:55:52.701]  So I understand why people are freaking out and thinking everything is bird flu being shipped around to kill them.
[01:55:54.099 --> 01:56:05.344]  I just never understand why the craziest stuff and the most uncredible stuff is what's put to the fore, what's put to the forefront instead of all the serious stuff.
[01:56:05.344 --> 01:56:07.645]  And that's what we cover here, it's what can be proven.
[01:56:07.645 --> 01:56:13.808]  But again, I don't blame people, NuffRespect and others, you know, for posting this and asking because
[01:56:15.036 --> 01:56:20.681]  Uh, when you've got a government this corrupt, this evil, this bad, who's been caught doing these things over and over again.
[01:56:20.681 --> 01:56:23.423]  I mean, I'll use one example of literally thousands.
[01:56:23.423 --> 01:56:25.645]  We put some of these examples in my film, Endgame.
[01:56:25.645 --> 01:56:28.187]  You know, all mainstream government documents, mainstream news.
[01:56:28.187 --> 01:56:28.928]  Imagine the U.S.
[01:56:28.928 --> 01:56:37.235]  government taking 4,000 plus foster children and putting them in radiation chambers and flipping a switch and killing them just to test radiation.
[01:56:38.919 --> 01:56:43.220]  And some of them they gave him a dose that killed him in a month, some of them gave him doses that killed him in an hour.
[01:56:43.220 --> 01:56:48.661]  You know, the reports would be the child cried and bled from every orifice for one week and then died.
[01:56:48.661 --> 01:56:54.082]  I mean, they'd have film cameras filming, you know, the sores coming up, the teeth falling out, the blood.
[01:56:54.082 --> 01:56:55.722]  I mean, this is zombie stuff!
[01:56:55.722 --> 01:57:04.984]  Picture the kids being radiated and then the doctors having them, you know, chained down, watching how they die, or giving pregnant G.I.'
[01:57:04.944 --> 01:57:07.184]  's wives uranium and plutonium pills.
[01:57:07.984 --> 01:57:12.706]  And saying this is vitamins and then have film cameras there when they had the miscarriage to see what it would do.
[01:57:12.706 --> 01:57:14.347]  This is all Joseph Mingala stuff.
[01:57:14.347 --> 01:57:17.709]  So, do I think they could be shipping bird flu around and doing all this?
[01:57:17.709 --> 01:57:19.289]  Well, yeah, I know they are!
[01:57:19.289 --> 01:57:21.851]  FedEx trucks crash and it dumps out all over the street!
[01:57:21.851 --> 01:57:24.532]  In fact, Google, uh...
[01:57:25.885 --> 01:57:28.827]  Car crash, bird flu, or truck crashes with bird flu.
[01:57:28.827 --> 01:57:29.868]  That was like four years ago.
[01:57:29.868 --> 01:57:31.889]  It made the news.
[01:57:31.889 --> 01:57:38.273]  But instead it's all this, I can't tell you, silos, missiles, iced, they pay them in cash.
[01:57:38.273 --> 01:57:39.193]  That's not how the government does it.
[01:57:39.193 --> 01:57:41.074]  They all do it nonchalant.
[01:57:41.074 --> 01:57:43.036]  It's government trucks doing that.
[01:57:43.036 --> 01:57:50.520]  Or if it's research facilities shipping bird flu out to hundreds of universities and institutions, it's done by FedEx.
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:51.341]  Which is crazy.
[01:57:53.308 --> 01:57:57.491]  And so I just ask people, stick with what you can prove.
[01:57:57.491 --> 01:58:05.617]  Please, get it out to people that they're shipping out bird flu all over the place and shooting people up with it.
[01:58:05.617 --> 01:58:09.720]  I mean, this isn't something that's speculative.
[01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:10.620]  This is proven.
[01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:12.041]  This is documented.
[01:58:12.041 --> 01:58:13.022]  This is admitted.
[01:58:13.022 --> 01:58:18.506]  Alright, I'm going to come back and do five focused minutes.
[01:58:18.506 --> 01:58:21.028]  I should have spent all day on this, but I got sidetracked.
[01:58:23.465 --> 01:58:27.348]  On the latest, this isn't a federally written report at the state level.
[01:58:27.348 --> 01:58:30.189]  This is an internal Homeland Security document.
[01:58:30.189 --> 01:58:32.471]  Up on InfoWars.com, gun owners are terrorists.
[01:58:32.471 --> 01:58:35.653]  Then we got Naomi Wolf coming up and then Joe Bannister.
[01:58:35.653 --> 01:58:37.514]  This is key.
[01:58:37.514 --> 01:58:38.194]  This is key.
[01:58:38.194 --> 01:58:43.057]  But we had to cover the other thing because it's discredited.
[01:58:43.057 --> 01:58:46.599]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.599 --> 01:58:48.881]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.598 --> 01:58:53.278]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:53.278 --> 01:58:56.259]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[01:58:56.259 --> 01:58:58.020]  And today, that's more important than ever.
[01:58:58.020 --> 01:59:00.981]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.981 --> 01:59:04.021]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:04.021 --> 01:59:09.883]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:59:10.103 --> 01:59:13.346]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:13.346 --> 01:59:20.352]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:20.352 --> 01:59:23.615]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:59:23.615 --> 01:59:25.177]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[01:59:40.788 --> 01:59:42.609]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:59:54.426 --> 01:59:56.826]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.826 --> 02:00:06.228]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.228 --> 02:00:07.528]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.528 --> 02:00:09.289]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.289 --> 02:00:11.049]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:11.049 --> 02:00:12.629]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:14.190]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.190 --> 02:00:18.370]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.370 --> 02:00:22.431]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.586 --> 02:00:37.233]  Okay, I'm going to bring this up to Joe Bannister coming up later, former Treasury officer in enforcement, because he's been listed in my reports and others.
[02:00:37.233 --> 02:00:41.415]  They also list mainline libertarian groups as terrorists.
[02:00:41.415 --> 02:00:47.178]  So we'll cover this more in the last hour today when Joe Bannister joins us to talk about the IRS and a lot of other issues.
[02:00:47.178 --> 02:00:49.279]  Naomi Wolf's coming up, but right now I want to get into it.
[02:00:50.586 --> 02:01:01.174]  Unclassified for official use only, right-wing extremism, current economic and political climate, fueling resurgence in radicalization and recruitment.
[02:01:01.174 --> 02:01:04.937]  And this story is up on Infowars.com, a story written by Curt Nemo.
[02:01:04.937 --> 02:01:18.027]  I called the FBI, I called the different organizations that are here in the document, the NICC, the National Information Coordinating Center,
[02:01:19.697 --> 02:01:20.918]  I called them and confirmed it.
[02:01:20.918 --> 02:01:24.800]  You can call the phone numbers on here if you'd like to talk to the FBI and others.
[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:26.981]  You are certainly welcome to this show.
[02:01:26.981 --> 02:01:31.543]  And what does the document say?
[02:01:31.543 --> 02:01:32.864]  That's not my marked copy.
[02:01:32.864 --> 02:01:35.965]  Here's my marked copy.
[02:01:35.965 --> 02:01:41.108]  They were pulling these copies down off the web last night before we got it put on our server, so I had a couple copies printed.
[02:01:42.262 --> 02:01:52.293]  Okay, it says the same exact wording that are on the state documents written by the feds about this is secret, you can't release it, and any cops that release it will get in big trouble.
[02:01:52.293 --> 02:02:03.165]  This is section U, key findings, the economic downturn in the election of the first African-American president, present unique drivers for right-wing radicalization and recruitment, so they imply everybody's racist.
[02:02:04.438 --> 02:02:14.045]  Uh, it says, uh, right-wing extremists have capitalized on the election of the first American President and are focusing their efforts on to recruit new members, mobilize existing supporters.
[02:02:14.045 --> 02:02:15.927]  Well, yeah, you're supposed to do that in America.
[02:02:15.927 --> 02:02:17.548]  And mobilize against tyranny.
[02:02:17.548 --> 02:02:20.410]  And broaden their scope and appeal through propaganda.
[02:02:20.410 --> 02:02:23.372]  But they have not yet turned to their attack plan.
[02:02:23.372 --> 02:02:25.233]  Then they go into listing mainline gun groups.
[02:02:25.233 --> 02:02:27.015]  We haven't yet turned to the attack plan.
[02:02:28.933 --> 02:02:32.357]  You haven't burned up any churches lately, Feds, huh?
[02:02:32.357 --> 02:02:42.147]  The possible passage of new restrictions on firearms and the return of militia veterans, military veterans, excuse me, facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities.
[02:02:42.147 --> 02:02:45.009]  So it goes on to attack veterans.
[02:02:45.009 --> 02:02:46.811]  Big time.
[02:02:46.811 --> 02:02:47.732]  Here is page 3.
[02:02:51.094 --> 02:03:05.019]  Proposed imposition of firearms restrictions, that's to introduce bills, and weapons bans are attracting new members into the ranks of right-wing extremist groups, as well as potential spur some of them to begin planning and training for violence against the government.
[02:03:05.019 --> 02:03:18.184]  The high volume of purchases, and this is the key, the high volume of purchases and stockpiling of weapons and ammunition by right-wing extremists in anticipation of restrictions and bans in some parts of the country continue to be a primary concern to law enforcement.
[02:03:19.793 --> 02:03:22.976]  So their primary concern is the fact that you're buying guns and ammo.
[02:03:22.976 --> 02:03:28.961]  And they say later that everybody buying guns and ammo is basically a terrorist.
[02:03:28.961 --> 02:03:33.464]  Their primary concern to law enforcement is that you're buying guns and ammo.
[02:03:33.464 --> 02:03:41.711]  In addition, the historical election of an African-American president, the prospect of policy changes are providing to be a driving force for right-wing extremist recruitment and radicalization.
[02:03:41.711 --> 02:03:46.055]  And they go on to talk about terrorism.
[02:03:46.055 --> 02:03:48.237]  They say anti-government ideology is racist.
[02:03:48.939 --> 02:03:50.681]  Nothing to do with it.
[02:03:50.681 --> 02:03:53.744]  It goes on to say, exploiting economic downturn.
[02:03:53.744 --> 02:03:55.305]  The perceived loss of U.S.
[02:03:55.305 --> 02:04:00.610]  jobs in manufacturing and construction sectors and home foreclosures is anti-Semitic.
[02:04:00.610 --> 02:04:02.792]  So, I just quoted that.
[02:04:02.792 --> 02:04:04.213]  They say the perceived loss.
[02:04:04.213 --> 02:04:07.897]  They're going to say it's propaganda, that we're lying about the economy, and that we're terrorists.
[02:04:11.294 --> 02:04:19.840]  It goes on to say, historical presidential election, social programs, minorities and firearms restrictions, being the policies of Barack Obama.
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:26.005]  So they're saying, we're coming after your guns, and the terrorists don't want that, and the terrorists are buying guns and ammo.
[02:04:26.005 --> 02:04:32.789]  It goes on to say, economic hardship and extremism.
[02:04:32.789 --> 02:04:40.295]  It says, prominent anti-government conspiracy theorists have incorporated aspects of the impending economic collapse to intensify fear and paranoia.
[02:04:43.427 --> 02:04:46.689]  Says we're making up detention camps.
[02:04:46.689 --> 02:04:49.011]  And the MIAC, though, they admit they've built them.
[02:04:49.011 --> 02:04:51.212]  And then it gets into they may have to restrict free speech.
[02:04:51.212 --> 02:04:52.373]  We'll cover that when we come back.
[02:04:52.373 --> 02:04:54.714]  So, uh, stay with us.
[02:04:54.714 --> 02:04:56.836]  This is a federal document from the very top.
[02:05:01.872 --> 02:05:07.254]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[02:05:07.254 --> 02:05:15.838]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[02:05:15.838 --> 02:05:19.399]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[02:05:19.399 --> 02:05:22.621]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[02:05:22.621 --> 02:05:25.122]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?

[02:05:55.081 --> 02:05:58.223]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:08.682 --> 02:06:14.545]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:06:14.545 --> 02:06:21.048]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:06:21.048 --> 02:06:23.029]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:06:23.029 --> 02:06:25.491]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:06:25.491 --> 02:06:36.376]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:06:38.664 --> 02:06:40.346]  It's not about left or right.
[02:06:40.346 --> 02:06:42.187]  It's about a one world government.
[02:06:42.187 --> 02:06:49.113]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:07:01.883 --> 02:07:09.110]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[02:07:09.110 --> 02:07:13.655]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[02:07:13.655 --> 02:07:19.280]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.

[02:07:38.041 --> 02:07:43.487]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[02:07:55.670 --> 02:07:57.211]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:19.846 --> 02:08:30.552]  Okay, coming up here in about three minutes, we have best-selling author and the new filmmaker who made the documentary, The End of America, two DVD set.
[02:08:30.552 --> 02:08:36.496]  Naomi Wolf is the author of seven books, including the New York Times bestseller, The Beauty Myth, The End of America, and Give Me Liberty.
[02:08:36.496 --> 02:08:44.341]  She has toured the speaking world to audiences of all walks of life in gender, equity, social justice, and most recently, the defense of liberty in America internationally.
[02:08:44.761 --> 02:08:51.045]  He's the co-founder of the Woodhull Institute for Ethical Leadership, who teaches ethics and empowerment of young women leaders.
[02:08:51.045 --> 02:08:51.625]  And it goes on.
[02:08:51.625 --> 02:08:53.086]  She really doesn't need any introduction.
[02:08:53.086 --> 02:08:55.628]  That's coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:08:55.628 --> 02:08:59.611]  I've got to finish this, and I'm going to get more into it with Joe Bannister coming up in the next hour.
[02:08:59.611 --> 02:09:04.754]  I've got this newest secret federal document that I call the FBI Confirmed as theirs.
[02:09:06.417 --> 02:09:15.139]  And it goes on to basically say, if you don't want to hand your guns in, you don't like what the banks are doing to you, you don't like Barack Obama, it's because he's black.
[02:09:15.139 --> 02:09:16.519]  You're racist.
[02:09:16.519 --> 02:09:19.640]  And that gun owners buying ammo and guns are terrorists.
[02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:23.721]  It says that these are terrorists and that our number one threat is the American people.
[02:09:23.721 --> 02:09:27.002]  So here they are saying, your gun owners are terrorists.
[02:09:27.002 --> 02:09:32.723]  Debates over appropriate legislation levels and enforcement policy generally fall in the realm of protected political speech.
[02:09:32.723 --> 02:09:33.183]  Generally.
[02:09:33.965 --> 02:09:34.986]  Under the First Amendment.
[02:09:34.986 --> 02:09:42.012]  But in some cases, anti-immigration or strident pro-enforcement fervor has been directed against specific groups and has the potential to turn violent.
[02:09:42.012 --> 02:09:48.217]  That means when the illegal aliens on hundreds of videos I've seen beat up old ladies with two-by-fours, then they arrest the old ladies.
[02:09:48.217 --> 02:09:49.739]  And you can Google those videos.
[02:09:49.739 --> 02:09:52.982]  The illegal aliens... Well, it's in my film, Endgame.
[02:09:53.482 --> 02:10:03.786]  We have a little bonus 17-minute film, Battle for the Republic, and it shows illegal aliens blocking traffic without a permit, and a guy, you know, is waving his hand out of the car saying, ah, shut up.
[02:10:03.786 --> 02:10:08.488]  The cops come over, knock his teeth out, bloody his face, and the illegals come over and celebrate with him.
[02:10:08.488 --> 02:10:14.431]  The officers celebrate the death of freedom, and this is how the tyranny works, so that's in my film.
[02:10:14.431 --> 02:10:16.692]  In fact, Google Battle for the Republic.
[02:10:17.552 --> 02:10:20.013]  And, uh, Alex Jones, Battle for the Republic.
[02:10:20.013 --> 02:10:21.114]  It's an extra from Endgame.
[02:10:21.114 --> 02:10:22.395]  It's all over the web.
[02:10:22.395 --> 02:10:26.377]  And, uh, just while we're talking to Naomi, let's just play the video.
[02:10:27.310 --> 02:10:31.375]  Of the cops and illegals beating up citizens that dare do anything.
[02:10:31.375 --> 02:10:32.656]  So that's coming up.
[02:10:32.656 --> 02:10:36.440]  And then it says legislative and judicial drivers admit they've introduced gun bans.
[02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:40.124]  They say when they ban the guns, the American terrorist gun owner will fight back.
[02:10:40.124 --> 02:10:41.766]  You can go read that.
[02:10:41.766 --> 02:10:47.232]  They say stockpiling weapons and ammunition is right-wing terror and that they're terrorists.
[02:10:48.208 --> 02:10:52.829]  They say you have a right to keep and bear arms, but that that means that they can ban your guns.
[02:10:52.829 --> 02:10:55.550]  They say, yes, it's a right for us to ban your guns.
[02:10:55.550 --> 02:10:57.491]  That's in the section under Legislative.
[02:10:57.491 --> 02:11:06.974]  It says the court reaffirmed the individual's right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment to the Constitution, but left open the debate, no it didn't, to precise contours of that right.
[02:11:06.974 --> 02:11:10.895]  And it goes on to say they can restrict it.
[02:11:10.895 --> 02:11:13.376]  So we'll be covering that.
[02:11:13.376 --> 02:11:15.756]  Disgruntled military veterans, says they gotta stop them.
[02:11:19.454 --> 02:11:21.455]  It just goes on from there on out.
[02:11:21.455 --> 02:11:25.438]  So, we go out and protest the private Federal Reserve.
[02:11:25.438 --> 02:11:28.860]  We have the Army spying on us at those events.
[02:11:28.860 --> 02:11:29.561]  And it's now admitted.
[02:11:29.561 --> 02:11:32.943]  You know, we don't like offshore banks stealing everything.
[02:11:32.943 --> 02:11:36.065]  Well, the Army was up there watching me and Ron Paul's brother in Dallas.
[02:11:36.065 --> 02:11:40.508]  And it said, in the document published at Infowars.com, that we are terrorists.
[02:11:40.508 --> 02:11:43.109]  It says, be careful, these terrorists may attack you.
[02:11:43.109 --> 02:11:48.693]  It tells the military to be in plain clothes, how to arrive, separate cars, to watch out, we may kill them any moment.
[02:11:49.946 --> 02:11:52.950]  This is the secret police takeover, and did it go away under Obama?
[02:11:52.950 --> 02:11:53.530]  No, it expanded.
[02:11:53.530 --> 02:11:54.371]  So we're going to Naomi Wolf.
[02:11:54.371 --> 02:11:56.914]  I appreciate joining us here in just one moment.
[02:11:56.914 --> 02:11:59.237]  Had to finish that, though.
[02:11:59.237 --> 02:11:59.958]  Just outrageous.
[02:12:01.749 --> 02:12:03.290]  I want to tell you about Pepperspray.com.
[02:12:03.290 --> 02:12:06.652]  We live in an unpredictable world, and as everyone knows, I'm all about preparedness.
[02:12:06.652 --> 02:12:08.934]  Remember, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
[02:12:08.934 --> 02:12:17.059]  That's why I want you to visit our new sponsor, Pepperspray.com, to check out their wide variety of personal safety products they have available on their website since 1994.
[02:12:17.059 --> 02:12:18.861]  Pepperspray.com.
[02:12:18.861 --> 02:12:26.386]  And you send your daughters off, you send your sons off, totally disarmed to be raped and killed, and call 9-1-1, well, at least have a taser or a big can of Pepperspray.
[02:12:26.846 --> 02:12:29.548]  I know a lot of the victim disarmament people want to train you to not have that.
[02:12:29.548 --> 02:12:33.511]  In England, they would arrest you, because you've got to be trained to be victims of the state and the criminals.
[02:12:33.511 --> 02:12:38.936]  But I say, real empowerment is women, especially, getting tasers and firearms as well.
[02:12:38.936 --> 02:12:43.399]  But also, this is a lot safer if you don't have firearms training.
[02:12:43.399 --> 02:12:44.800]  Pepper Spray of all kinds of strengths.
[02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:46.061]  Stun guns and tasers.
[02:12:46.061 --> 02:12:46.802]  Animal repellents.
[02:12:46.802 --> 02:12:47.402]  Home safety.
[02:12:47.402 --> 02:12:48.383]  Personal alarms.
[02:12:48.383 --> 02:12:49.264]  Pepperspray.com.
[02:12:50.931 --> 02:12:54.232]  And, uh, one other sponsor I want to tell you about is Ecolablue.com.
[02:12:54.232 --> 02:12:56.092]  Atmospheric water generator from the home.
[02:12:56.092 --> 02:12:58.553]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[02:12:58.553 --> 02:13:00.053]  Pure, clean water without the fluoride.
[02:13:00.053 --> 02:13:01.914]  Unlimited water from the humidity in the air.
[02:13:01.914 --> 02:13:03.614]  Knows exactly what you're drinking.
[02:13:03.614 --> 02:13:06.755]  Machine produces over 28 liters of water in 24 hours.
[02:13:06.755 --> 02:13:08.036]  7.5 gallon generator.
[02:13:08.036 --> 02:13:12.397]  Uh, generator water is passed through seven filters including reverse osmosis and carbon.
[02:13:12.397 --> 02:13:13.217]  Simple to use.
[02:13:13.217 --> 02:13:15.057]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[02:13:15.057 --> 02:13:16.298]  Neutral pH.
[02:13:16.298 --> 02:13:18.378]  Your own source of clean drinking water.
[02:13:18.378 --> 02:13:20.199]  And how the filtration process works?
[02:13:20.879 --> 02:13:27.562]  You can read about that at ecoloblue.com or 800-691-6043.
[02:13:27.562 --> 02:13:40.248]  Okay, without further ado, we now go to Naomi Wolf, who really needs no introduction, with her new film out on DVD, which is excellent, covering the whole police state situation.
[02:13:40.248 --> 02:13:42.029]  Mrs. Wolf, good to have you here with us.
[02:13:42.029 --> 02:13:44.010]  It's really nice to talk to you again, Alex.
[02:13:44.010 --> 02:13:45.370]  And please call me Naomi.
[02:13:45.370 --> 02:13:46.991]  Okay, Naomi.
[02:13:46.991 --> 02:13:48.392]  Tell us about your new film.
[02:13:50.141 --> 02:14:01.667]  Sure, it was put together in great haste because we were very concerned about the direction the country was going and in some ways, you know, still is.
[02:14:01.667 --> 02:14:18.736]  And what it is, is it's bringing to life the second-to-last book I wrote, The End of America, which is basically The Ten Steps to Fascism, and arguing that, well, we've talked about this here with your community before, that we're seeing in the United States, or we have been in some ways, we still are,
[02:14:19.232 --> 02:14:29.297]  The rapid build-up of the kinds of things you see when a leadership wants to close an open society or crush a democracy movement.
[02:14:29.297 --> 02:14:38.041]  And put together by these beautiful filmmakers, very well-regarded, Annie Sundberg and Ricky Stern, who are prize-winning filmmakers.
[02:14:38.041 --> 02:14:44.644]  And what was so exciting to me as an author is that you write about things like
[02:14:45.413 --> 02:14:47.874]  Police brutality or the military moving in in St.
[02:14:47.874 --> 02:14:49.415]  Paul, as you mentioned in your intro.
[02:14:49.415 --> 02:14:58.400]  You write about, you know, Meher Arar being stopped at, you know, JFK and taken to Syria, tortured for two years and without due process.
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:03.362]  And it's kind of abstract, even if you use your greatest skills as an author.
[02:15:03.362 --> 02:15:10.326]  But for me, just seeing these actual people come to life and seeing the filmmakers, you know, interview James Yee, who was
[02:15:10.714 --> 02:15:11.254]  We're good to go.
[02:15:33.586 --> 02:15:36.447]  You know, it goes beyond what any writer can do with a computer.
[02:15:36.447 --> 02:16:01.376]  So, I'm very proud of it, I'm very excited about it, and what I've been asking people to do, and the filmmakers and this Grassroots Democracy campaign we've started have been asking people to do is, and this is why we made it available for a while for free online too, is that you should, if you support the message, hold a gathering in your home and screen it, and then pass out copies of the
[02:16:06.792 --> 02:16:14.356]  I guess we lost her line.
[02:16:14.356 --> 02:16:18.919]  Hey, okay, fantastic there.
[02:16:18.919 --> 02:16:20.619]  That happens sometimes with phone lines.
[02:16:20.619 --> 02:16:23.361]  So we'll get Naomi Wolf back on the line with us right now.
[02:16:23.361 --> 02:16:25.362]  Yeah, she got to film the end of America.
[02:16:25.362 --> 02:16:26.483]  Yeah, where they use U.S.
[02:16:26.483 --> 02:16:27.943]  Army on citizens.
[02:16:27.943 --> 02:16:28.864]  And then last week,
[02:16:29.841 --> 02:16:36.264]  The Governor told the regular Army, we heard you're going to run checkpoints on the highways of citizens and search everybody's cars?
[02:16:36.264 --> 02:16:37.444]  You can't do that.
[02:16:37.444 --> 02:16:38.805]  And the Army said, shut up!
[02:16:38.805 --> 02:16:39.985]  We're under P.A.D.
[02:16:39.985 --> 02:16:41.126]  51, pal.
[02:16:41.126 --> 02:16:43.427]  NORTHCOM.
[02:16:43.427 --> 02:16:45.628]  John Warren Defense Authorization Act.
[02:16:45.628 --> 02:16:52.831]  And the local newspapers reported that they were out there running the checkpoints.
[02:16:52.831 --> 02:16:54.572]  And I had a state rep on about that.
[02:16:54.572 --> 02:16:59.374]  That's what this country has turned into, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:01.041 --> 02:17:04.962]  That's what we have become.
[02:17:04.962 --> 02:17:18.407]  Now, we're going to continue as soon as we get her back online to go over this information here today and a host of other subjects.
[02:17:18.407 --> 02:17:26.069]  We do have Joe Bannister coming up to join us in the next hour.
[02:17:26.069 --> 02:17:30.391]  Some of the other news that I have here in front of me
[02:17:31.915 --> 02:17:37.158]  Is GM told to prep for bankruptcy filing report?
[02:17:37.158 --> 02:17:38.379]  And we'll be getting into that.
[02:17:38.379 --> 02:17:41.681]  Obama's now taking over GM and is telling them what to do.
[02:17:41.681 --> 02:17:44.623]  China's saying they may stop buying our debt and have slowed down doing that.
[02:17:44.623 --> 02:17:47.144]  Okay, Naomi, we lost your line.
[02:17:47.144 --> 02:17:48.665]  Sorry about that or whatever happened.
[02:17:48.665 --> 02:17:49.245]  You're back on.
[02:17:49.245 --> 02:17:54.709]  You were talking about writing about the TRIBs being used against the American people versus it actually happening.
[02:17:54.709 --> 02:17:58.671]  For those that don't know, tell folks what's in the film, what happened at the RNC in Minnesota.
[02:17:59.818 --> 02:18:01.999]  Sure, and I apologize, my phone went dead.
[02:18:01.999 --> 02:18:02.980]  That's okay, go ahead.
[02:18:02.980 --> 02:18:05.121]  Well, thank you.
[02:18:05.121 --> 02:18:23.489]  What happened was that ordinary American citizens were, some of them were just walking along the street, some of them were protesting, you know, peacefully, and what you see is this militarized phalanx of, you know, kind of looks like riot police, but it turns out that the military was actually in
[02:18:26.878 --> 02:18:46.390]  You know, they're present at the convention, advising and docking the police, and they round up citizens and, you know, guns pointed at them, and, you know, brutally heard them, you know, arrest them, brutally sort of throw them around, and, you know, you see Amy Goodman, who's a journalist, kind of dragged away into custody, having done nothing.
[02:18:46.390 --> 02:18:53.054]  I mean, these people are guilty of being Americans and using their First Amendment rights, and eight American citizens have been charged as terrorists.
[02:18:53.715 --> 02:18:54.716]  I don't know.
[02:19:14.435 --> 02:19:25.455]  I can't identify my source immediately, but I think the ACLU or one of the rights organizations confirms that in addition to local police
[02:19:26.121 --> 02:19:28.343]  The military was present.
[02:19:28.343 --> 02:19:32.167]  You know, we were concerned about the 1st Brigade being deployed, and then two more brigades.
[02:19:32.167 --> 02:19:38.052]  We talked about this close to the election, and the 1st Brigade, or some military, were reported to be there.
[02:19:38.052 --> 02:19:39.674]  Oh, no, I mean, I remember seeing it in the news.
[02:19:39.674 --> 02:19:41.996]  I just wanted you specifically to talk about it from your angle.
[02:19:41.996 --> 02:19:42.476]  Stay there.
[02:19:42.476 --> 02:19:44.699]  We have Naomi Wolf, bestselling author, researcher.
[02:19:45.540 --> 02:19:48.223]  On with this, and she's also worked on this new film that's out.
[02:19:48.223 --> 02:19:54.933]  It's free on the internet, but I suggest you go to the website we're gonna give out later and actually get the DVD to support them so they can make future films.
[02:19:54.933 --> 02:19:56.375]  Naomi Wolf is our guest.
[02:19:56.375 --> 02:19:57.016]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:19:57.016 --> 02:19:58.578]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:19:58.578 --> 02:19:59.680]  Quick break, we'll come right back to her.
[02:20:03.609 --> 02:20:04.049]  We're good to go.
[02:20:27.176 --> 02:20:33.178]  Pepper spray dot com carries one of the largest assortments of pepper spray and personal safety products on the web.
[02:20:33.178 --> 02:20:35.859]  From big to small, we have it all.
[02:20:35.859 --> 02:20:39.901]  Pepper spray, mace, animal repellents, stun guns and tasers.
[02:20:39.901 --> 02:20:46.623]  Pepper spray dot com also carries a large assortment of products for personal, home, child and pet safety.
[02:20:46.623 --> 02:20:46.843]  Enter
[02:20:46.903 --> 02:20:51.664]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:20:51.664 --> 02:20:58.106]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:21:17.012 --> 02:21:25.200]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:30.285]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:21:30.285 --> 02:21:34.910]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:21:35.490 --> 02:21:39.831]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of International Banking Cartel.
[02:21:39.831 --> 02:21:40.932]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:40.932 --> 02:21:45.433]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:21:45.433 --> 02:21:50.334]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:21:50.334 --> 02:21:53.335]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:21:53.335 --> 02:21:55.095]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:55.095 --> 02:21:55.355]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:55.355 --> 02:21:56.956]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[02:22:05.242 --> 02:22:07.887]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:22:07.887 --> 02:22:14.901]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:22:15.456 --> 02:22:22.041]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:22:22.041 --> 02:22:24.023]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:22:24.023 --> 02:22:26.525]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:22:26.525 --> 02:22:37.494]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:22:38.084 --> 02:22:39.746]  It's not about left or right.
[02:22:39.746 --> 02:22:41.607]  It's about a one world government.
[02:22:41.607 --> 02:22:48.533]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:22:48.533 --> 02:22:56.800]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:56.800 --> 02:22:58.362]  The Obama Deception.
[02:22:58.362 --> 02:22:59.563]  The people strike back.
[02:23:01.511 --> 02:23:05.753]  If you have over $10,000 in credit card debt, you need to hear this.
[02:23:05.753 --> 02:23:10.675]  Have you been watching the banks getting their bailout money and wondering where your relief is?
[02:23:10.675 --> 02:23:13.236]  The answer you're looking for is the bailout group.
[02:23:13.236 --> 02:23:18.778]  The bailout group has settled over $100 million in credit card debt for people just like you.
[02:23:18.778 --> 02:23:27.582]  The bailout group can help cut your debt by up to 60% of its original value, removing those high interest fees and rolling everything into one low monthly payment.
[02:23:27.822 --> 02:23:28.862]  And the best part?
[02:23:28.862 --> 02:23:33.544]  All GCN listeners qualify for a free 5-minute debt relief consultation.
[02:23:33.544 --> 02:23:37.386]  This is the system that credit card companies don't want you to know about.
[02:23:37.386 --> 02:23:41.927]  This is a fast, proven, and legal process for your credit card debt concerns.
[02:23:41.927 --> 02:23:43.648]  Call the bailout group now at 800-324-6554.
[02:23:43.648 --> 02:23:43.868]  That's 800-324-6554.
[02:23:43.868 --> 02:23:45.429]  Debt relief experts are standing by.
[02:23:45.429 --> 02:23:47.470]  You have nothing to lose except your credit card debt.
[02:23:47.470 --> 02:23:47.730]  Call 800-324-6554.
[02:24:02.757 --> 02:24:05.499]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:24:05.499 --> 02:24:12.364]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:12.364 --> 02:24:13.745]  Naomi Wolf is our guest.
[02:24:13.745 --> 02:24:17.327]  Naomi, I know you're about to be on your cell phone, because we set you up on short notice.
[02:24:17.327 --> 02:24:19.729]  We want to have you back in the near future when you can be on a landline with us.
[02:24:19.729 --> 02:24:24.552]  So I want to get back in the film, but I remember you being on the show with us.
[02:24:27.151 --> 02:24:35.374]  Six months ago or so, right before the election, and I said, look, Obama's going to win, Bush isn't going to declare martial law, it's on record.
[02:24:35.374 --> 02:24:44.497]  I said, Bush, his job is to set up martial law, his job is to get it all ready, and then Obama's going to come in with the left covering and do it.
[02:24:44.497 --> 02:24:55.361]  And now, Obama has announced no right for detainees, backs Bush, staying in Iraq, beefing up Afghanistan, hiring nothing but lobbyists, uh... just
[02:24:56.201 --> 02:24:56.621]  Alex?
[02:24:56.621 --> 02:24:56.702]  Yes?
[02:24:56.702 --> 02:24:59.044]  Can you say the last sentence again?
[02:24:59.044 --> 02:24:59.344]  I'm sorry.
[02:25:20.836 --> 02:25:26.778]  Okay, so this is terrible and I so apologize, but the internet is so bad that I can't hear you.
[02:25:26.778 --> 02:25:31.100]  Should I call you back later in the day?
[02:25:31.100 --> 02:25:32.380]  Yeah, yeah, we're just going to call you back.
[02:25:32.380 --> 02:25:33.861]  We're going to call you back.
[02:25:33.861 --> 02:25:34.681]  Thank you, Naomi.
[02:25:34.681 --> 02:25:38.062]  Guys, set her up another day when she can do it over the phone.
[02:25:38.062 --> 02:25:43.284]  I don't like this guest thing where they're on their cell phones, okay?
[02:25:43.284 --> 02:25:44.665]  More and more we need to ask the guest.
[02:25:45.675 --> 02:25:47.877]  No, we don't have to have you soon.
[02:25:47.877 --> 02:25:51.459]  We'll have you on when you can be on a landline.
[02:25:51.459 --> 02:25:53.901]  So, call her back, tell her thank you, I'm done.
[02:25:53.901 --> 02:25:54.181]  Okay?
[02:25:54.181 --> 02:25:56.283]  Good.
[02:25:56.283 --> 02:25:59.245]  That way I can cover other news anyways and take your phone calls.
[02:25:59.245 --> 02:26:01.387]  Specifically with this report,
[02:26:03.882 --> 02:26:04.983]  What do you think about this?
[02:26:04.983 --> 02:26:07.826]  I'm gonna come back and take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:26:07.826 --> 02:26:07.886]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:26:24.232 --> 02:26:26.514]  And we will discuss this when we come back from the break.
[02:26:26.514 --> 02:26:39.245]  Also, everybody freaking out over all their secret silos and mobile vans with the bird flu on ice and they're gonna get us with no proof it's even real or that if it is somebody thinking they found something real that it's bird flu.
[02:26:39.245 --> 02:26:47.713]  While people are being killed, dying, people in government control, people in government custody, homeless people all over the world being given experimental bird flu shots.
[02:26:47.713 --> 02:26:51.176]  And then the media, French news agency AP, Bloomberg,
[02:26:52.984 --> 02:27:00.027]  Literally hundreds of papers won't say who the companies are, what vaccine this is, killing people.
[02:27:00.027 --> 02:27:16.293]  All of this on the heels of Bayer Pharmaceutical, and all the AIDS in their shots, and hepatitis, and Baxter Pharmaceutical shipping out live, weaponized, killer bird flu, and then ordering it mixed with regular flu vaccine.
[02:27:18.499 --> 02:27:20.742]  Now, that's going on.
[02:27:20.742 --> 02:27:22.204]  The media won't say where it went.
[02:27:22.204 --> 02:27:24.447]  There's no more investigations we know of.
[02:27:24.447 --> 02:27:30.975]  Our own patriot movement, Alternative Media, isn't freaking out over confirmed bird flu being shipped out.
[02:27:30.975 --> 02:27:35.141]  Confirmed people dying being given the vaccines and tests.
[02:27:35.141 --> 02:27:36.142]  That's your big story.
[02:27:36.923 --> 02:27:45.529]  Now, now, with that backdrop, I don't blame people freaking out and calling into talk shows and, you know, but again, I know how this stuff works and how the weaponization works.
[02:27:45.529 --> 02:27:47.190]  I know government protocols.
[02:27:47.190 --> 02:27:54.115]  It just, that particular story I covered earlier is baloney from my instincts and research.
[02:27:54.115 --> 02:27:55.136]  Doesn't matter, though.
[02:27:55.136 --> 02:27:59.279]  You can't blame people freaking out with all this real stuff that is going on.
[02:28:00.563 --> 02:28:00.803]  So, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:28:00.803 --> 02:28:00.963]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:28:00.963 --> 02:28:02.564]  We'll get you up and on the air today.
[02:28:02.564 --> 02:28:08.205]  And then just this incredible story I've got here out of the Times of London dealing with the fact that
[02:28:25.825 --> 02:28:28.026]  China is already cutting back buying U.S.
[02:28:28.026 --> 02:28:28.966]  bonds.
[02:28:28.966 --> 02:28:29.947]  That is, buying U.S.
[02:28:29.947 --> 02:28:31.027]  currency.
[02:28:31.027 --> 02:28:35.349]  Very, very, very serious.
[02:28:35.349 --> 02:28:36.589]  I'm trying to find that story.
[02:28:36.589 --> 02:28:39.150]  I just had it out here in front of me.
[02:28:39.150 --> 02:28:39.970]  Then I got stuff like this.
[02:28:39.970 --> 02:28:42.811]  Gordon Brown's plan for army of teen volunteers.
[02:28:42.811 --> 02:28:47.233]  Gordon Brown has vowed to make every young person do 50 hours of voluntary work.
[02:28:47.233 --> 02:28:48.834]  They make you do voluntary work.
[02:28:48.834 --> 02:28:49.834]  Same thing being proposed.
[02:28:51.497 --> 02:29:17.196]  uh... being pushed here in the United States and I haven't even gotten to this big stack uh... of news I've got in front of me so we'll be uh... going over that report and then these crazy type reports secret homeland security threat assessment labels gun owners political terrorist intelligence document says extremist radical stockpiling weapons and ammunition of fear of
[02:29:18.206 --> 02:29:18.807]  Gun ban.
[02:29:18.807 --> 02:29:19.727]  I want to get your take on that.
[02:29:19.727 --> 02:29:20.668]  And then this one.
[02:29:20.668 --> 02:29:25.272]  Microchip that tells the GP if you've taken your pills.
[02:29:25.272 --> 02:29:30.217]  They want you to swallow microchips that sit there and scan everything going on in your intestines.
[02:29:30.217 --> 02:29:31.198]  Oh, and here's that article.
[02:29:31.198 --> 02:29:32.659]  China slows purchase of U.S.
[02:29:32.659 --> 02:29:33.980]  and other bonds.
[02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:35.642]  So, and then a bunch of eugenics news.
[02:29:35.642 --> 02:29:36.222]  That's coming up.
[02:29:36.222 --> 02:29:38.805]  But first, your phone calls, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:29:38.805 --> 02:29:42.428]  Straight ahead, after this quick break, right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:52.071 --> 02:29:55.996]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.996 --> 02:29:58.699]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.423 --> 02:30:05.944]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:30:05.944 --> 02:30:11.346]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:30:11.346 --> 02:30:16.508]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:30:16.508 --> 02:30:27.612]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[02:30:28.012 --> 02:30:33.797]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[02:30:33.797 --> 02:30:40.063]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:30:40.063 --> 02:30:41.104]  What about you?
[02:30:41.104 --> 02:30:43.045]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[02:30:43.045 --> 02:30:47.549]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[02:31:02.581 --> 02:31:07.843]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:31:08.627 --> 02:31:14.512]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:31:14.512 --> 02:31:21.016]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:31:21.016 --> 02:31:22.978]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:31:22.978 --> 02:31:25.440]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:31:25.440 --> 02:31:36.328]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:31:38.630 --> 02:31:40.291]  It's not about left or right.
[02:31:40.291 --> 02:31:42.151]  It's about a one world government.
[02:31:42.151 --> 02:31:49.054]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:31:57.317 --> 02:31:58.897]  The Obama Deception.
[02:31:58.897 --> 02:32:00.058]  The people strike back.
[02:32:01.809 --> 02:32:03.130]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:03.130 --> 02:32:08.712]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:32:08.712 --> 02:32:13.734]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:32:13.734 --> 02:32:19.296]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:32:19.296 --> 02:32:23.998]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:32:24.517 --> 02:32:31.641]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:32:31.641 --> 02:32:32.762]  And here's the best part.
[02:32:32.762 --> 02:32:39.446]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:32:39.446 --> 02:32:42.628]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:42.628 --> 02:32:45.710]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:32:45.710 --> 02:32:45.910]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:32:45.910 --> 02:32:46.150]  Remember,
[02:32:54.568 --> 02:32:58.491]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:32:58.491 --> 02:33:00.873]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:33:21.425 --> 02:33:23.570]  Alright, we're back live!
[02:33:33.120 --> 02:33:34.741]  Let's go straight to your phone calls.
[02:33:34.741 --> 02:33:36.081]  We've got Joe Bannister coming up.
[02:33:36.081 --> 02:33:38.362]  A ton of news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[02:33:38.362 --> 02:33:40.223]  It's all completely off the charts and insane.
[02:33:40.223 --> 02:33:43.365]  I mean, how can anybody deny the government's out of control?
[02:33:43.365 --> 02:33:44.825]  We're losing our liberties.
[02:33:44.825 --> 02:33:46.746]  Tyranny's unfolding.
[02:33:46.746 --> 02:33:55.930]  The Mexican government came out this weekend and said, we're going to be meeting with Obama this week, President Obama, about how he's going to ban all the assault weapons and shut down the gun shows.
[02:33:55.930 --> 02:33:57.151]  That's what they're openly saying.
[02:33:58.431 --> 02:34:10.161]  So now it's not enough to have a criminal government going after our Second Amendment, now they get to blame the narco-terrorist state, the phony drug war, the disarmed victims in Mexico.
[02:34:10.161 --> 02:34:12.684]  Look at all the places they point at and say we need more gun control.
[02:34:12.684 --> 02:34:21.011]  Chicago, New York, all victim disarmament zones, all places where the people have been disarmed and where they have corrupt
[02:34:22.808 --> 02:34:24.229]  Wicked governments that rule them.
[02:34:24.229 --> 02:34:25.449]  But, I'm digressing.
[02:34:25.449 --> 02:34:26.449]  I'm digressing.
[02:34:26.449 --> 02:34:27.130]  Let's go to calls.
[02:34:27.130 --> 02:34:28.490]  Chris in Tennessee.
[02:34:28.490 --> 02:34:29.751]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:34:29.751 --> 02:34:30.551]  Hello, Alex.
[02:34:30.551 --> 02:34:32.672]  Alex, you're exactly right about Glenn Beck.
[02:34:32.672 --> 02:34:42.175]  I remember his first interview with Ron Paul when he was saying he had to wear a bulletproof vest and Secret Service was guarding his family and now he wants the supporters.
[02:34:42.817 --> 02:34:47.660]  of the Ron Paul supporters, and he's definitely a fake and a phony.
[02:34:47.660 --> 02:34:51.122]  He's talked on air about how he hates the 9-11.
[02:34:51.122 --> 02:34:52.523]  Sir, sir, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[02:34:52.523 --> 02:34:54.944]  Sir, sir, sir, I mean, you brought up Glenn Beck.
[02:34:54.944 --> 02:34:55.505]  You know what?
[02:34:55.505 --> 02:35:05.251]  I'm going to write a note about Beck since you brought him up, because every time a listener reminds me of something, I remember that I'm not even attacking him with one-tenth of the truth.
[02:35:06.071 --> 02:35:08.092]  But you're absolutely right about Beck.
[02:35:08.092 --> 02:35:10.773]  I remember him saying Secret Service was protecting him.
[02:35:10.773 --> 02:35:12.594]  He hates no one like 9-11 truthers.
[02:35:12.594 --> 02:35:14.175]  He hates the victims' families.
[02:35:14.175 --> 02:35:15.515]  He hates the Patriot movement.
[02:35:15.515 --> 02:35:16.736]  He hates militias.
[02:35:16.736 --> 02:35:18.216]  He hates gun owners.
[02:35:18.216 --> 02:35:21.878]  And then the feds came to him and said, look, you really want to burn these people?
[02:35:21.878 --> 02:35:22.818]  We love you.
[02:35:22.818 --> 02:35:24.179]  You hate America?
[02:35:24.179 --> 02:35:25.179]  We love you, Beck.
[02:35:25.179 --> 02:35:26.500]  Literally.
[02:35:26.500 --> 02:35:28.941]  You co-opt them so we can destroy them.
[02:35:28.941 --> 02:35:31.022]  And Beck said, absolutely.
[02:35:31.022 --> 02:35:32.442]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:35:32.442 --> 02:35:33.583]  Within the last two weeks,
[02:35:34.196 --> 02:35:42.131]  And I want to know, what do you think that will do to our economy with a Mad Cow Beef recall?
[02:35:42.131 --> 02:35:45.137]  Well, I mean, they have been hyping that, and there's no doubt.
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:49.142]  The government puts out reports in England and the U.S.
[02:35:49.142 --> 02:35:52.044]  saying we're crazy, we're insane, there's something wrong with us.
[02:35:52.044 --> 02:36:01.691]  We shouldn't want them to have these rendering plants where they mix dead animals, dead cats, dead dogs from the euthanasia facilities.
[02:36:01.691 --> 02:36:03.172]  This is mainstream news.
[02:36:03.172 --> 02:36:07.795]  Dead pigs, dead cows, rotten dead animals.
[02:36:07.795 --> 02:36:11.438]  Their feces, their intestines, they just scoop up the guts whole and dump them in.
[02:36:11.438 --> 02:36:13.960]  And then they mix them together into a sludge.
[02:36:14.540 --> 02:36:15.820]  And they feed that to cows.
[02:36:15.820 --> 02:36:22.903]  Now, they don't just, again, feed meat to cows that aren't meant to not eat meat and have three stomachs.
[02:36:22.903 --> 02:36:26.464]  They're feeding them rotten meat.
[02:36:26.464 --> 02:36:28.885]  And so it has these crystals in it.
[02:36:28.885 --> 02:36:38.668]  And then that gets in our brains, and now they're reporting 20-year-olds are getting Alzheimer's, 15-year-olds are getting it, 30-year-olds, and they say that's a normal part of life now.
[02:36:38.668 --> 02:36:39.789]  And then, of course, the
[02:36:40.589 --> 02:36:43.290]  All the metals in the foods do it as well in the vaccines.
[02:36:43.290 --> 02:36:44.570]  It all adds together.
[02:36:44.570 --> 02:36:49.072]  And they just say, look, it's normal to be 15 years old and have Alzheimer's.
[02:36:49.072 --> 02:36:50.012]  Now, come on.
[02:36:50.012 --> 02:36:50.932]  Don't be extremist.
[02:36:50.932 --> 02:36:52.813]  Eat the beef.
[02:36:52.813 --> 02:36:58.715]  And the prions precipitate out near bones.
[02:36:58.715 --> 02:37:01.376]  So it's the meat off the back of the animal.
[02:37:01.376 --> 02:37:05.497]  T-bones and things like that you want to watch out for.
[02:37:05.497 --> 02:37:07.478]  But I think you bring up a good point.
[02:37:07.478 --> 02:37:07.718]  Go ahead.
[02:37:08.775 --> 02:37:09.496]  Al, you have a good day.
[02:37:09.496 --> 02:37:10.236]  Thank you very much.
[02:37:10.236 --> 02:37:11.477]  Yeah, thank you.
[02:37:11.477 --> 02:37:12.698]  Anything else?
[02:37:12.698 --> 02:37:27.630]  Sir, thanks again, Mr. Infowarrior, and I wish that you would be partners with Barack Obama so we can finally find out what was involved with Building 7 and the rest of the things that exactly happened that day.
[02:37:27.630 --> 02:37:33.055]  If you had an investigation, I think that right now is the time to go after G.W.
[02:37:33.055 --> 02:37:33.315]  Bush.
[02:37:34.485 --> 02:37:36.647]  And to get to the truth of the matter.
[02:37:36.647 --> 02:37:38.648]  It's still an open murder investigation.
[02:37:38.648 --> 02:37:39.789]  Alex, you have a good day.
[02:37:39.789 --> 02:37:40.049]  Thanks.
[02:37:40.049 --> 02:37:43.271]  Yeah, I don't think Obama's going to be doing that, joining up with me.
[02:37:43.271 --> 02:37:51.196]  Obama's there to protect Bush and continue with the globalist operation, which he's doing.
[02:37:51.196 --> 02:37:54.518]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls.
[02:37:54.518 --> 02:37:57.080]  I mean, on the subject of Beck.
[02:37:57.080 --> 02:38:00.722]  No, I mean, he talked about how much he hates us all, and then now he's our leader.
[02:38:04.448 --> 02:38:07.150]  Because the establishment is saying, we can't beat this Patriot movement.
[02:38:07.150 --> 02:38:10.172]  They were right, the New World Order is real, the bankers are taking over.
[02:38:10.172 --> 02:38:14.755]  How do we ensure the banks are able to fully repossess the country and bankrupt us like a third world nation?
[02:38:14.755 --> 02:38:17.817]  And they tell the black op commanders, we gotta co-opt them.
[02:38:17.817 --> 02:38:18.658]  And they say, yes sir!
[02:38:19.889 --> 02:38:23.272]  Because it's fun for Beck and all them to sucker the public.
[02:38:23.272 --> 02:38:24.793]  It's an enjoyment.
[02:38:24.793 --> 02:38:26.975]  It's all part of hatred of freedom and liberty.
[02:38:26.975 --> 02:38:28.976]  These people really hate you and your family.
[02:38:28.976 --> 02:38:30.497]  They really hate your freedom.
[02:38:30.497 --> 02:38:31.678]  And I mean that when I say it.
[02:38:31.678 --> 02:38:32.899]  I've studied them.
[02:38:32.899 --> 02:38:34.601]  And people ask, I go back to rape.
[02:38:34.601 --> 02:38:35.902]  Why would a guy want to rape a woman?
[02:38:35.902 --> 02:38:36.902]  Why would he want to force it on her?
[02:38:36.902 --> 02:38:40.525]  You know, if there's somebody like me, that sounds insane.
[02:38:40.525 --> 02:38:42.747]  I mean, the whole point is you want the woman willing.
[02:38:42.747 --> 02:38:43.588]  That's the fun part.
[02:38:44.670 --> 02:38:47.532]  But see, you have to remember, evil people, they enjoy rape.
[02:38:47.532 --> 02:38:48.912]  They enjoy destruction.
[02:38:48.912 --> 02:38:49.993]  They enjoy pillaging.
[02:38:49.993 --> 02:38:51.234]  They enjoy lying.
[02:38:51.234 --> 02:38:52.815]  They enjoy getting it over on you.
[02:38:52.815 --> 02:38:55.576]  They enjoy how dumbed down the public is.
[02:38:55.576 --> 02:38:58.738]  This is the ether in which they swim.
[02:38:58.738 --> 02:39:01.539]  The lack of sophistication of the public.
[02:39:01.539 --> 02:39:03.120]  They hate seeing minds unlocked.
[02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:05.241]  They hate seeing renaissance.
[02:39:05.241 --> 02:39:06.782]  They're into being the insiders.
[02:39:06.782 --> 02:39:08.003]  They're parasites.
[02:39:08.003 --> 02:39:09.804]  They're scum.
[02:39:09.804 --> 02:39:11.625]  And good people need to rise up and deal with them.
[02:39:11.625 --> 02:39:13.246]  If we take action, there's nothing they can do.
[02:39:14.397 --> 02:39:18.858]  Dennis in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:39:18.858 --> 02:39:19.618]  Come ahead, Dennis.
[02:39:19.618 --> 02:39:22.739]  Okay, let's go to Frank in Louisiana.
[02:39:22.739 --> 02:39:25.639]  Frank, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:39:25.639 --> 02:39:27.720]  Yes, Alex, good afternoon.
[02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:29.840]  Just briefly about Beck.
[02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:32.701]  Just remember this, loyal opposition, okay?
[02:39:32.701 --> 02:39:35.781]  They've been doing this for centuries, man.
[02:39:35.781 --> 02:39:40.602]  They don't pay those guys out of Manhattan millions of dollars to tell you the truth.
[02:39:40.602 --> 02:39:44.203]  But anyway, what I wanted to inform you about, finally,
[02:39:45.527 --> 02:39:57.830]  After many years of my dealings with the IRS, when they have many acts of sedition they committed against me and Supreme Court rulings, I finally received a document.
[02:39:57.830 --> 02:39:59.690]  I got them.
[02:39:59.690 --> 02:40:07.731]  They sent me a document on irs.gov saying that the 16th Amendment was a tax on all individuals.
[02:40:07.731 --> 02:40:15.113]  Now anybody who knows words of art and legal definition, the vocabulous artist knows that individuals means men and women.
[02:40:16.408 --> 02:40:19.172]  No, you're saying it's a direct tax.
[02:40:19.172 --> 02:40:25.560]  The Bruce Schaber v. Union Pacific Railroad, a Landmore case, says it's an indirect tax.
[02:40:25.560 --> 02:40:32.669]  And we also know that from the Dahl v. Mitchell Brothers case, the 16th Amendment is a tax on corporations.
[02:40:32.669 --> 02:40:33.451]  I got you, IRS.
[02:40:34.318 --> 02:40:36.159]  No, absolutely, but they don't care.
[02:40:36.159 --> 02:40:37.099]  They're criminals.
[02:40:37.099 --> 02:40:40.660]  I mean, you know, the IRS didn't exist until 1913 when the private banks took over.
[02:40:40.660 --> 02:40:45.221]  They had to have their way, just like we're a third world country, to have the money paid to the bankers.
[02:40:45.221 --> 02:40:52.423]  And we've had a financial coup since then, and now the bankers are getting ready to finally fold the U.S.
[02:40:52.423 --> 02:40:56.265]  up, a public scream of bloody murder, and so they're making their move against us right now.
[02:40:56.265 --> 02:40:56.765]  This is it.
[02:40:56.765 --> 02:40:59.025]  This is the final takeover.
[02:40:59.025 --> 02:41:00.906]  I don't think people realize, Alex,
[02:41:01.758 --> 02:41:09.277]  The full extent of it, people, the younger people who are just getting involved in awakening, but you know, this whole government...
[02:41:09.855 --> 02:41:15.239]  Is being operated literally for a private commercial enterprise of a small handful of private bankers.
[02:41:39.875 --> 02:41:40.857]  So they can sterilize you.
[02:41:53.408 --> 02:41:53.908]  Audit.
[02:41:53.908 --> 02:41:54.589]  They gotta do it.
[02:41:54.589 --> 02:41:56.009]  It's a constitutional audit.
[02:41:56.009 --> 02:42:03.832]  I agree, but that's what's so outrageous about this is that openly private families own and run the government.
[02:42:03.832 --> 02:42:05.153]  They're totally illegitimate.
[02:42:05.153 --> 02:42:09.475]  They've stolen $12.8 trillion in the last six months.
[02:42:09.475 --> 02:42:12.796]  They're openly putting troops on the streets everywhere.
[02:42:12.796 --> 02:42:15.037]  They're openly throwing down the gauntlet.
[02:42:15.037 --> 02:42:17.498]  They're openly saying gun owners are terrorists.
[02:42:17.498 --> 02:42:21.539]  They're openly have the Mexican government telling Americans we have to turn our guns in.
[02:42:21.539 --> 02:42:21.900]  I mean, again,
[02:42:23.300 --> 02:42:31.964]  It's so off the charts now, that if we'll just go explain this to the public, we can turn this around and take this nation back.
[02:42:31.964 --> 02:42:36.185]  We have a chance, but more people have to activate now.
[02:42:36.185 --> 02:42:40.207]  I have to say the Tea Parties are the perfect thing, because you gotta remember,
[02:42:40.919 --> 02:42:46.524]  America's two civil wars were precipitated by tax rebellions and states' rights.
[02:42:46.524 --> 02:42:47.605]  And gun confiscation.
[02:42:47.605 --> 02:42:49.166]  You're absolutely right, and I appreciate your call.
[02:42:49.166 --> 02:42:53.330]  And that's why, suddenly Fox News goes, there is a world government.
[02:42:53.330 --> 02:42:54.391]  There is a global tax.
[02:42:54.391 --> 02:42:56.072]  Because they can't deny it anymore.
[02:42:56.072 --> 02:42:57.954]  All these years, it doesn't exist, doesn't exist.
[02:42:57.954 --> 02:42:59.515]  We go, here's all the government documents.
[02:42:59.515 --> 02:43:06.181]  Now that the globalists are announcing it in all the financial papers, but saying it's good, Fox has to play the part of, okay, we're the guardians.
[02:43:07.509 --> 02:43:09.170]  We are against that.
[02:43:09.170 --> 02:43:12.091]  We are going to fight this.
[02:43:12.091 --> 02:43:16.333]  Here's our man, Glenn Beck, and he goes, yes, yes, I'm a patriot, I'm with you.
[02:43:16.333 --> 02:43:17.933]  We need to arrest the militias.
[02:43:17.933 --> 02:43:18.594]  Ha ha!
[02:43:18.594 --> 02:43:19.454]  That's patriotism!
[02:43:19.454 --> 02:43:20.854]  And people go, yeah!
[02:43:20.854 --> 02:43:22.335]  That's how you stop the bankers.
[02:43:22.335 --> 02:43:26.777]  Arrest the gun owners!
[02:43:26.777 --> 02:43:28.718]  I mean, this is a sick joke.
[02:43:28.718 --> 02:43:30.458]  Let's talk to Bill in Connecticut.
[02:43:30.458 --> 02:43:31.239]  Bill, you're on the air.
[02:43:31.239 --> 02:43:32.239]  Welcome.
[02:43:32.239 --> 02:43:32.619]  Hey, Alex.
[02:43:32.619 --> 02:43:33.480]  How you doing today?
[02:43:33.480 --> 02:43:33.920]  Pretty good, sir.
[02:43:34.602 --> 02:43:34.942]  Real good.
[02:43:34.942 --> 02:43:38.287]  Hey, I just wanted to let you know I got the film, The Obama Deception.
[02:43:38.287 --> 02:43:39.709]  I just got that delivered.
[02:43:39.709 --> 02:43:43.794]  And I wanted to say thanks for all the other stuff you guys throw in there.
[02:43:43.794 --> 02:43:50.523]  And I wanted to find out about ordering about a thousand of these Citizen's Rule books.
[02:43:50.523 --> 02:43:52.886]  This is pretty interesting to hand out.
[02:43:53.916 --> 02:43:55.318]  So that was one of the things I wanted to find out about.
[02:43:55.318 --> 02:44:01.564]  Well, you know we have all the federal documents saying you hand out Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence that the police have sworn an oath to.
[02:44:01.564 --> 02:44:06.670]  They call that a terrorist document in the, I'm not kidding folks, the government calls those citizen rule books.
[02:44:06.670 --> 02:44:09.093]  In fact, where's my terrorist document?
[02:44:09.093 --> 02:44:15.159]  Because it shows, bring me one folks, it shows that everything they're doing is illegal.
[02:44:16.201 --> 02:44:24.805]  It shows that they're a pack of criminals outside the law, and then they're saying we're terrorist lawbreakers because we're pointing out that our country's been hijacked.
[02:44:24.805 --> 02:44:26.986]  And then, again, the Feds have got a problem.
[02:44:26.986 --> 02:44:39.471]  There's hundreds of these reports out saying new world order doesn't exist, global government doesn't exist, global currency doesn't exist, NAFTA and Gatlin good for the economy, you know, they say it's a conspiracy theory that the economy's bad in this latest one.
[02:44:39.471 --> 02:44:40.532]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[02:44:41.590 --> 02:44:42.811]  It's so ridiculous.
[02:44:42.811 --> 02:44:47.332]  And all these cops that are reading this are going, wait a minute, everything they're saying here came true.
[02:44:47.332 --> 02:44:52.354]  So now they're saying, well, there is a global government, there are camps, but it's for your own good.
[02:44:52.354 --> 02:44:58.677]  Hey Alex, there was a couple of things that were brought to my attention here today.
[02:44:58.677 --> 02:45:05.500]  One of my Ron Paul groups that I belong to got this email showing, I believe it's Keith Olbermann.
[02:45:06.665 --> 02:45:12.530]  On TV and he did this thing here says Obama moves to legalize warrantless wiretapping.
[02:45:13.686 --> 02:45:15.447]  Yeah, we played that clip.
[02:45:15.447 --> 02:45:26.390]  They are legalizing 10, well not 10, maximum infinity, unlimited wiretapping, internet hubs, even small internet companies will have a federal hub.
[02:45:26.390 --> 02:45:29.891]  Everything will run through the government, just like the telephones already do.
[02:45:29.891 --> 02:45:32.932]  The internet already does as well, but they want it in all the regional systems.
[02:45:32.932 --> 02:45:36.293]  No warrants, no more Fourth Amendment, no more nothing.
[02:45:36.293 --> 02:45:38.094]  And Keith Olbermann has been forced to admit it's true.
[02:45:38.934 --> 02:45:40.255]  That's what I'm saying!
[02:45:40.255 --> 02:45:45.258]  But I still have all these Obama zombies telling me that none of this exists and everything's fine.
[02:45:45.258 --> 02:45:47.820]  Just one other thing.
[02:45:47.820 --> 02:45:53.304]  I read The Economist religiously, which is, as far as I'm concerned, this is the aristocrat's rag that they read.
[02:45:53.304 --> 02:45:55.325]  I thought it was amazing.
[02:45:55.325 --> 02:46:03.951]  On page 64 of this week's issue, it says here, it says, Spanish firms hope to benefit from America's stimulus plan.
[02:46:03.951 --> 02:46:05.292]  Okay?
[02:46:05.292 --> 02:46:06.953]  And it goes on here to say that
[02:46:07.711 --> 02:46:16.476]  The stimulus plan is 317 billion dollars of intended spending, but Spain is the only country to have built a campaign around it.
[02:46:16.476 --> 02:46:18.658]  And here's where all this stuff gets interesting.
[02:46:18.658 --> 02:46:19.618]  It's down here at the bottom of it.
[02:46:19.618 --> 02:46:33.187]  It says, of the 10 biggest construction Spanish firms, including Ferro Rival, have pioneered public-private partnerships in construction and operation of infrastructure in Florida, Illinois, Texas,
[02:46:34.938 --> 02:46:48.770]  Oh yeah, I knew what you were about to go to.
[02:46:48.770 --> 02:46:50.151]  That's what this is.
[02:46:50.151 --> 02:46:54.114]  They take our tax money and then give it to the offshore corporations.
[02:46:54.114 --> 02:47:00.140]  They even take our tax money to build factories in other countries.
[02:47:01.388 --> 02:47:07.549]  And then they have the Austin Chronicle write articles saying Alex Jones is insane, Sintra is not owned by Spain.
[02:47:07.549 --> 02:47:16.991]  And so understand, Sintra and others aren't just being given the roads to put toll roads on 8,000 miles of Texas roads.
[02:47:16.991 --> 02:47:18.711]  They're being paid to do it.
[02:47:18.711 --> 02:47:23.192]  See, it's like the bankers get 12.8 trillion of our tax money.
[02:47:23.192 --> 02:47:26.433]  We have to pay the interest to give them the money.
[02:47:26.433 --> 02:47:27.193]  You understand?
[02:47:27.193 --> 02:47:28.813]  You don't just give the bankers your money.
[02:47:29.838 --> 02:47:31.439]  But this isn't just Texas.
[02:47:31.439 --> 02:47:33.461]  I mean, this is talking about the corridor.
[02:47:33.461 --> 02:47:35.302]  I mean, this even includes Illinois.
[02:47:35.302 --> 02:47:36.383]  I mean, where do you think that's going?
[02:47:36.383 --> 02:47:37.684]  It's going to Canada.
[02:47:37.684 --> 02:47:38.285]  Well, no, no, no.
[02:47:38.285 --> 02:47:39.746]  I mean, we have their official maps.
[02:47:39.746 --> 02:47:42.047]  North American Union, NAFTA superhighways.
[02:47:42.047 --> 02:47:43.549]  I mean, that's what my film Endgame covers.
[02:47:43.549 --> 02:47:44.830]  No, I agree.
[02:47:44.830 --> 02:47:51.935]  And yes, The Economist, The Financial Times of London, and a few others are the establishment's real papers of record.
[02:47:51.935 --> 02:47:53.016]  And they say... It's unbelievable.
[02:47:53.016 --> 02:47:56.979]  They had one other article in here on... just two things in here.
[02:47:56.979 --> 02:47:58.120]  One other article I just wanted to bring up.
[02:47:58.735 --> 02:48:03.096]  This one here was pertaining to water, okay?
[02:48:03.096 --> 02:48:15.800]  And how, you know, you and I and everybody here in America, we drink too much, so therefore, uh, you know, they're doing this whole thing to, you know, shut down all the water, what we can actually have, and so on and so forth.
[02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:19.400]  This is, uh, page... It's not just America.
[02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:22.241]  I mean, it's all over the place, but it's talking about... No, it's globalism.
[02:48:22.241 --> 02:48:24.362]  Which issue of The Economist is that?
[02:48:24.362 --> 02:48:24.982]  This week's issue.
[02:48:25.802 --> 02:48:28.844]  Yeah, well mail it to me, maybe I'll use some clips on air.
[02:48:28.844 --> 02:48:30.366]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:48:30.366 --> 02:48:33.888]  I know, I mean, that's what's so incredible.
[02:48:33.888 --> 02:48:37.151]  Because I sit here frustrated, burning with energy, upset.
[02:48:37.151 --> 02:48:43.396]  Because I've got to keep trying to explain to the public these are parasite criminals.
[02:48:43.396 --> 02:48:48.880]  They're fully hijacking our entire society.
[02:48:48.880 --> 02:48:52.863]  They're grabbing the roads, the infrastructure, they're brainwashing the police against us.
[02:48:55.339 --> 02:49:00.648]  And they're just gonna steal and steal and steal and steal and steal and steal and steal and steal.
[02:49:00.648 --> 02:49:02.051]  Because our government's wide open.
[02:49:02.051 --> 02:49:03.413]  We have no protection.
[02:49:03.413 --> 02:49:04.675]  Pure tyranny has come in.
[02:49:06.783 --> 02:49:08.624]  That's what the new order is.
[02:49:08.624 --> 02:49:09.985]  It's a select group of bankers.
[02:49:09.985 --> 02:49:11.847]  I mean, you know what they talk about at these big U.N.
[02:49:11.847 --> 02:49:16.530]  meetings and Club of Rome meetings and CFR meetings and Trilateral Commission and Bilderberg?
[02:49:16.530 --> 02:49:18.372]  We've gotten the minutes out of them.
[02:49:18.372 --> 02:49:19.553]  It's okay.
[02:49:19.553 --> 02:49:23.576]  We're going to give you $3 trillion the next year.
[02:49:23.576 --> 02:49:34.384]  We're going to give the banks the money and then the government will then give that money to your private bank to then buy the roads.
[02:49:34.384 --> 02:49:35.645]  And then we'll pay you to buy the roads.
[02:49:37.850 --> 02:49:39.891]  And yes, that's the economic stimulus package.
[02:49:39.891 --> 02:49:41.272]  I mean, that's all it is.
[02:49:41.272 --> 02:49:43.073]  It's just raping!
[02:49:43.073 --> 02:49:45.794]  All of this is indescribable.
[02:49:45.794 --> 02:49:49.836]  But the caller mentioned how he's getting the Obama deception out to people.
[02:49:49.836 --> 02:49:55.940]  All over the country, at tea parties coming up later this week, and in the Fed rallies, but not just there.
[02:49:57.242 --> 02:50:00.443]  At other events, people are making copies of the Obama Deception.
[02:50:00.443 --> 02:50:01.924]  This film is about the bankers.
[02:50:01.924 --> 02:50:03.685]  This film is about who the criminals are.
[02:50:03.685 --> 02:50:06.566]  This film is about the financial raping of the people.
[02:50:06.566 --> 02:50:09.367]  This film covers it all.
[02:50:09.367 --> 02:50:11.728]  And this film needs to be seen by everyone.
[02:50:11.728 --> 02:50:15.769]  So, just having the DVD or buying the DVD at Infowars.com, that's great.
[02:50:15.769 --> 02:50:18.030]  That supports the radio show and future filmmaking.
[02:50:18.030 --> 02:50:21.352]  But what really is effective is airing it on AXS TV.
[02:50:21.352 --> 02:50:21.952]  Very easy to do.
[02:50:23.527 --> 02:50:29.311]  Making copies of it, giving it to people, spreading the internet links around to folks, downloading it at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:50:29.311 --> 02:50:31.333]  Please get it out to everyone.
[02:50:31.333 --> 02:50:33.114]  Have viewing parties.
[02:50:33.114 --> 02:50:33.935]  Wake people up.
[02:50:33.935 --> 02:50:38.939]  I mean, Obama is just out in the open a criminal.
[02:50:38.939 --> 02:50:40.880]  All we gotta do is stand up to him and expose him.
[02:50:40.880 --> 02:50:44.523]  Alright, more calls straight ahead.
[02:50:44.523 --> 02:50:46.785]  Yeah, it's just, uh...
[02:50:48.211 --> 02:50:53.014]  Indiana, Texas, California, Michigan, Oregon, everything.
[02:50:53.014 --> 02:50:55.315]  Florida, they're just grabbing everything.
[02:50:55.315 --> 02:50:56.656]  They're just grabbing everything.
[02:50:56.656 --> 02:50:59.618]  It's just totally criminal, out in the open.
[02:50:59.618 --> 02:51:00.719]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:02.318 --> 02:51:04.739]  Worried about the side effects from prescription drugs?

[02:51:56.970 --> 02:52:08.561]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:08.561 --> 02:52:15.608]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:52:16.115 --> 02:52:22.320]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:22.320 --> 02:52:24.682]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:24.682 --> 02:52:27.184]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:27.184 --> 02:52:38.153]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:38.769 --> 02:52:40.429]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:40.429 --> 02:52:42.290]  It's about a one world government.
[02:52:42.290 --> 02:52:49.192]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:52:49.192 --> 02:52:57.454]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:57.454 --> 02:52:59.035]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:59.035 --> 02:53:00.215]  The people strike back.
[02:53:02.797 --> 02:53:08.300]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:53:08.300 --> 02:53:09.100]  and the world.
[02:53:09.100 --> 02:53:12.962]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[02:53:12.962 --> 02:53:19.465]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[02:53:19.465 --> 02:53:21.486]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[02:53:21.486 --> 02:53:29.430]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[02:53:29.710 --> 02:53:34.415]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[02:53:34.415 --> 02:53:40.221]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[02:53:40.221 --> 02:53:42.403]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.

[02:53:48.828 --> 02:53:49.368]  Factory direct.
[02:53:49.368 --> 02:53:50.868]  Wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[02:53:50.868 --> 02:53:51.789]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[02:53:51.789 --> 02:53:54.250]  Ladies and gentlemen, the elite is in control because they're totally ruthless.
[02:54:13.069 --> 02:54:20.454]  They spend the majority of their money on eugenics programs, on breaking up the family, on poisoning you and your family.
[02:54:20.454 --> 02:54:25.978]  They're coming right out in the open calling for one-child policies in the United States and Europe.
[02:54:25.978 --> 02:54:36.546]  They're doing this because they're getting ready to totally bankrupt everybody, and then you're going to be on basically a government paycheck now, and they're going to tell you how to live your life.
[02:54:36.546 --> 02:54:37.446]  This is bondage.
[02:54:37.446 --> 02:54:38.127]  This is control.
[02:54:39.757 --> 02:54:48.324]  And we're so decadent, we've been so brainwashed that the public is still standing down to a great extent because they can't believe what's happening.
[02:54:48.324 --> 02:54:52.227]  Here's a quick example, I'm going to go back to your calls.
[02:54:52.227 --> 02:54:58.292]  I decided, I knew that Media Matters was owned by George Soros.
[02:54:58.292 --> 02:55:00.254]  He was the main financier.
[02:55:00.254 --> 02:55:07.860]  Lying about me, attacking me, really engaging in libel and slander and classical forms of defamation.
[02:55:10.418 --> 02:55:21.543]  But then I looked into Alternet, and you know who, if you go to the Federal Register, you can look it up, it is foundation run, Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, Soros Foundations.
[02:55:21.543 --> 02:55:31.528]  And so they're writing article after article, saying I need to be shut off the radio and have my free speech taken.
[02:55:31.528 --> 02:55:39.052]  You see, why am I being attacked directly by the Ford Foundation, directly by the Rockefeller Foundation, directly by George Soros?
[02:55:41.707 --> 02:55:43.048]  In fact, I've got that in the stack.
[02:55:43.048 --> 02:55:46.230]  I even printed it all off.
[02:55:46.230 --> 02:55:50.813]  If I have time near the end of the show, I'll get into it, or I may do a show on it tomorrow.
[02:55:50.813 --> 02:55:51.873]  I've got the printouts right here.
[02:55:51.873 --> 02:55:53.254]  Ford Foundation.
[02:55:53.254 --> 02:55:53.635]  Alternet.
[02:55:53.635 --> 02:56:04.682]  You can go right to the federal websites that have all the foundation money telling you who gets what.
[02:56:04.682 --> 02:56:06.943]  They're doing this because they know we're telling the truth.
[02:56:06.943 --> 02:56:08.304]  They know we know what they're up to.
[02:56:11.912 --> 02:56:19.957]  And I'm glad they're attacking me, because it lets me know I'm doing my job.
[02:56:19.957 --> 02:56:28.561]  They have already engaged in irrevocable, devastating, terminal financial attacks on the country.
[02:56:28.561 --> 02:56:31.203]  We're like a nation that's been stabbed hundreds of times.
[02:56:31.203 --> 02:56:36.586]  We've gone into shock, the last blood's coming out of us, and we've turned white, and we're dying right now.
[02:56:37.674 --> 02:56:39.315]  And they're just sitting there with pleasure.
[02:56:39.315 --> 02:56:40.416]  All the American haters.
[02:56:40.416 --> 02:56:41.436]  All the control freaks.
[02:56:41.436 --> 02:56:42.677]  All the parasites.
[02:56:42.677 --> 02:56:43.858]  These are just bad people.
[02:56:43.858 --> 02:56:44.618]  They hate you.
[02:56:44.618 --> 02:56:45.499]  They hate your family.
[02:56:45.499 --> 02:56:46.840]  They hate your Second Amendment.
[02:56:46.840 --> 02:56:48.241]  They hate your freedoms.
[02:56:48.241 --> 02:56:49.161]  Look at all the other countries.
[02:56:49.161 --> 02:56:56.186]  They're all run by pot-bellied scum that loves the Lord around in fancy outfits with giant frongs of starving people outside their palaces.
[02:56:56.186 --> 02:56:58.107]  That's their tool of control.
[02:56:58.107 --> 02:56:59.628]  They enjoy degradation.
[02:56:59.628 --> 02:57:00.989]  They enjoy pain.
[02:57:00.989 --> 02:57:03.871]  They enjoy sorrow.
[02:57:03.871 --> 02:57:06.433]  They hate your freedoms.
[02:57:06.433 --> 02:57:06.893]  They're evil.
[02:57:09.412 --> 02:57:13.194]  And they control the left and the right.
[02:57:13.194 --> 02:57:18.176]  And until we wake up to them and say no, it's only going to get worse.
[02:57:18.176 --> 02:57:19.157]  Now they're scared now, though.
[02:57:21.052 --> 02:57:22.712]  You see they've gone past the point of return.
[02:57:22.712 --> 02:57:26.854]  They've made the decision to go after the guns and start shootouts with the police.
[02:57:26.854 --> 02:57:42.638]  It'll go into martial law and have the economic displacement and breakdown and use the collapse of Mexico to ban guns here and they're now announcing it and a lot of their minions and servants are starting to figure out we told them the truth and that this is real and that and so they're getting a little concerned now and so they're starting to blow the whistle.
[02:57:44.178 --> 02:57:54.025]  And the establishment's moved offshore, because they know they're going to plan kind of a Soviet culling, the Great Harvest as they call it, the mass murder.
[02:57:54.025 --> 02:58:01.010]  But because we warned people before it happened, by them making this move and trying this, we're going to defeat them.
[02:58:01.010 --> 02:58:03.332]  Because they've gone past the point of incrementalism.
[02:58:03.332 --> 02:58:08.015]  They can't incrementally creep around and do this anymore.
[02:58:08.015 --> 02:58:13.059]  They've now thrown down the gauntlet, they've now put it in high gear, they're going right up against humanity.
[02:58:16.488 --> 02:58:21.830]  And so, the battle is joined, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:21.830 --> 02:58:23.530]  I wish every day this wasn't real.
[02:58:23.530 --> 02:58:27.712]  I wish every day they weren't shipping bird flu all over the world and shooting people up with it and they're dying.
[02:58:27.712 --> 02:58:30.873]  That's mainstream news, but nobody in the, quote, alternative movement wants to cover it.
[02:58:30.873 --> 02:58:36.815]  It's like there's mental block or something from covering real news, so they only can cover the weird, made-up crap.
[02:58:36.815 --> 02:58:38.676]  We'll come back, take a few calls, and go to Joe Bannister.
[02:58:38.676 --> 02:58:39.056]  Stay with me.
[02:58:39.056 --> 02:58:45.158]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:51.929 --> 02:58:53.610]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.610 --> 02:58:58.355]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:58.355 --> 02:59:01.318]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:01.318 --> 02:59:04.361]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:04.361 --> 02:59:10.227]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:59:10.447 --> 02:59:13.670]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.670 --> 02:59:20.677]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:59:20.677 --> 02:59:23.960]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[02:59:40.473 --> 02:59:41.014]  Take action today.
[02:59:41.014 --> 02:59:42.355]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:54.699 --> 02:59:57.081]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:57.081 --> 03:00:03.264]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:03.264 --> 03:00:08.548]  We are now into the fourth and final hour.
[03:00:23.553 --> 03:00:24.574]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:00:24.574 --> 03:00:26.836]  Still taking your phone calls.
[03:00:26.836 --> 03:00:30.359]  Joe Bannister coming up in the next segment.
[03:00:30.359 --> 03:00:31.900]  I'm gonna shotgun a ton of news at him.
[03:00:31.900 --> 03:00:37.285]  Let's talk to Bob in Washington, and Norma, Dave, Marcus, and others.
[03:00:37.285 --> 03:00:39.947]  Go ahead, Bob.
[03:00:39.947 --> 03:00:41.008]  Hey, Alex.
[03:00:41.008 --> 03:00:42.949]  Hey.
[03:00:42.949 --> 03:00:49.715]  Hey, I, uh, I initially called you to find out, uh, what you make of this video that popped, that seemed to pop up over the
[03:00:50.623 --> 03:01:17.267]  over the weekend about the uh... bird flu shipments and uh... and um... that in tandem sort of with the one that popped up a couple of months ago about uh... mass graves in chicago and whether you think that that's all i mean obviously now i talk to the reporters who gave me the name of the emergency manager of the county i called him i confirmed it cc that's us saying this report is confirmed
[03:01:19.224 --> 03:01:28.010]  We called the source, and then I presented you with mainstream news about the mass graves and incinerators.
[03:01:28.010 --> 03:01:31.232]  Did you hear me go over that?
[03:01:31.232 --> 03:01:33.354]  Unfortunately, I did not.
[03:01:33.354 --> 03:01:35.095]  Well, we've written articles about it and posted it.
[03:01:35.095 --> 03:01:37.137]  In fact, let me just show you again.
[03:01:38.154 --> 03:01:39.055]  I just had it earlier.
[03:01:39.055 --> 03:01:43.840]  I can't actually show this over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.
[03:01:43.840 --> 03:01:45.621]  But, um, here it is.
[03:01:45.621 --> 03:01:47.483]  I thought that you were bringing it up again.
[03:01:47.483 --> 03:01:48.544]  Stop, stop.
[03:01:48.544 --> 03:01:49.145]  No, no, no.
[03:01:49.145 --> 03:01:53.869]  Just let me get it for you.
[03:01:53.869 --> 03:01:54.430]  Okay, here it is.
[03:01:54.430 --> 03:01:55.451]  I'm going to show it to you again.
[03:01:55.451 --> 03:01:57.613]  Okay?
[03:01:57.613 --> 03:01:59.615]  Masquerade folder, right here.
[03:01:59.615 --> 03:02:00.596]  This will be the fifth time.
[03:02:00.596 --> 03:02:01.637]  I don't mind doing this.
[03:02:01.637 --> 03:02:02.658]  People can't always listen.
[03:02:04.167 --> 03:02:09.151]  Rocky Mountain News, state prepares for bioterrorism, February 8, 2003.
[03:02:09.151 --> 03:02:21.560]  The state of Colorado sees antibodies cremate disease-ridden corpses and under extreme circumstances dig mass graves under executive orders drafted for the use in the event of a bioterrorism attack.
[03:02:21.560 --> 03:02:30.467]  Then it goes into the governor's measures, the mass grave sites, the incinerators, and how they're getting ready for that.
[03:02:30.467 --> 03:02:30.707]  Okay.
[03:02:31.212 --> 03:02:37.098]  Now, I could go on through these all day, but here's State of New York, Department of State, Division of Cemeteries.
[03:02:37.098 --> 03:02:40.722]  You can read this document, call the phone numbers, it's real.
[03:02:40.722 --> 03:02:47.108]  Out of the article written by Aaron Dykes, plans for mass graves confirmed, government surveying cemetery readiness for flu outbreak.
[03:02:47.108 --> 03:02:54.816]  So they're preparing for millions all over the country, tens of thousands per cemetery, and you can call the phone numbers and call the state, they admit this is real, okay?
[03:02:56.112 --> 03:03:07.655]  So, so see, we're covering what's real and admitted, but no one will talk about it, no one will put up a YouTube video, no one will discuss it, no one will get into it.
[03:03:07.655 --> 03:03:23.659]  We have bird flu knowingly shipped out all over the world, 18 countries in Europe, mixed with real, normal vaccines, then suddenly there's secret vaccine trials with all these people dying in bird flu vaccine trials, but the media, London Telegraph,
[03:03:25.239 --> 03:03:35.405]  All these other publications, Bloomberg, won't do another investigation and won't say what companies it were that are lying to people saying it's a flu shot and then killing them.
[03:03:35.405 --> 03:03:41.328]  Did you hear me read a French news agency in London Telegraph earlier?
[03:03:41.328 --> 03:03:42.128]  Yeah, I did.
[03:03:42.128 --> 03:03:44.189]  Okay, well, people don't believe me watching.
[03:03:44.189 --> 03:03:46.331]  Right now, let me just dig it out again.
[03:03:46.331 --> 03:03:47.271]  It's here in the stack.
[03:03:47.271 --> 03:03:49.472]  Again, I go over so many articles here.
[03:03:49.472 --> 03:03:50.373]  Let me find it for you.
[03:03:50.373 --> 03:03:50.773]  Here it is.
[03:03:50.773 --> 03:03:52.174]  Okay, let me get this for folks one more time.
[03:03:52.901 --> 03:04:02.463]  Instead it's some crazy woman literally going, missiles and refrigerated and down silos and meanwhile we've got it all admitted right out in the open going on.
[03:04:02.463 --> 03:04:09.465]  Instead the media is going to look at that and anyone who knows how operations work or anything is going to think we're a bunch of idiots.
[03:04:09.465 --> 03:04:17.066]  Okay, just like the media all over the country is going out and saying these are just graves being expanded at VA cemeteries.
[03:04:17.066 --> 03:04:18.227]  It's sad but true.
[03:04:18.227 --> 03:04:19.947]  A lot of our veterans are passing now.
[03:04:21.761 --> 03:04:28.229]  Instead of going, by the way, this cemetery signed an agreement to be ready to bury 100,000 Americans during a bio-attack.
[03:04:28.229 --> 03:04:30.552]  See, they don't tell you the other part.
[03:04:30.552 --> 03:04:36.739]  And so they strawman us, and they're able to do that because laymen, the general public, are now getting involved as reporters, which is great.
[03:04:36.739 --> 03:04:39.042]  It's all part of the process.
[03:04:39.042 --> 03:04:39.683]  They're getting involved.
[03:04:41.069 --> 03:04:44.272]  Homeless die after bird flu vaccine trial.
[03:04:44.272 --> 03:04:47.334]  Health workers on trial for vaccine scam in Poland.
[03:04:47.334 --> 03:04:47.714]  See?
[03:04:47.714 --> 03:04:48.555]  See that?
[03:04:48.555 --> 03:04:48.895]  See that?
[03:04:48.895 --> 03:04:54.480]  So we know they've shipped bird flu out, then they're giving them these vaccines that are killing people in the same countries.
[03:04:54.480 --> 03:04:56.562]  That's what we should be concerned about.
[03:04:56.562 --> 03:04:59.744]  Anything else, sir?
[03:04:59.744 --> 03:05:00.125]  Anything else?
[03:05:02.059 --> 03:05:07.141]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.
[03:05:07.141 --> 03:05:14.224]  Our hemp foods are anti-inflammatory and gluten-free and can greatly benefit the health of the human body.
[03:05:14.224 --> 03:05:23.248]  By calling 908-691-2608 or visiting hempusa.org, you can benefit from this wonderful natural food source.
[03:05:23.248 --> 03:05:30.671]  Our customers are also purchasing this natural food for long-term storage, camping, survival and emergency food rations.
[03:05:31.172 --> 03:05:36.734]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit hempusa.org today.
[03:05:36.734 --> 03:05:45.277]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future and food will be your greatest asset.
[03:05:45.277 --> 03:05:52.059]  People spend money on all kinds of things, but our warning is prepare now for food shortages in the future.
[03:05:52.901 --> 03:06:01.606]  So don't delay, call today, 908-691-2608, and see what our powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[03:06:01.606 --> 03:06:08.589]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:06:08.589 --> 03:06:15.573]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[03:06:16.155 --> 03:06:22.659]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:06:22.659 --> 03:06:24.700]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:06:24.700 --> 03:06:27.221]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:06:27.221 --> 03:06:38.187]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:06:38.786 --> 03:06:40.447]  It's not about left or right.
[03:06:40.447 --> 03:06:42.309]  It's about a one world government.
[03:06:42.309 --> 03:06:49.214]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:06:49.214 --> 03:06:57.501]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:57.501 --> 03:06:59.062]  The Obama Deception.
[03:06:59.062 --> 03:07:00.263]  The people strike back.
[03:07:02.208 --> 03:07:05.289]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:07:05.289 --> 03:07:10.811]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:07:10.811 --> 03:07:16.533]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:07:16.533 --> 03:07:18.013]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:07:18.013 --> 03:07:27.016]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[03:07:27.056 --> 03:07:27.316]  Of course!
[03:07:27.316 --> 03:07:29.158]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[03:07:29.158 --> 03:07:33.383]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[03:08:02.139 --> 03:08:07.561]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:07.561 --> 03:08:09.842]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:22.729 --> 03:08:28.371]  Well, for the rest of the show, and we'll take your phone calls, we have Joe Bannister.
[03:08:28.371 --> 03:08:48.039]  Joseph R. Bannister is believed to be the first Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division Special Agent ever to discover alleged wrongdoing in the establishment, administration, and enforcement of the federal income tax, and then confront his superiors and top officials in the IRS about these allegations and his belief that taxpayer rights were being violated.
[03:08:48.559 --> 03:08:55.902]  After confronting the IRS officials with the results contained in the investigative report, his inquiries were similarly rebuffed, and he was encouraged to resign.
[03:08:55.902 --> 03:08:58.543]  He resigned on February 25th, 1999.
[03:08:58.543 --> 03:09:00.644]  I interviewed him right after that happened.
[03:09:00.644 --> 03:09:03.085]  We were the first people to interview him.
[03:09:03.085 --> 03:09:11.468]  I got a tip that this was happening, and I happened to be out in California for Urban Warrior, where they were trying to confiscate Americans' guns with the military, all on video.
[03:09:12.108 --> 03:09:20.383]  And so that's why we got the interview first, put it on local TV in Austin and on the web, and it's in the film I made, Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports Exposed.
[03:09:21.616 --> 03:09:24.397]  I'm proud of the fact that we brought Mr. Bannister out first.
[03:09:24.397 --> 03:09:28.098]  Mr. Bannister is a graduate of San Jose State University.
[03:09:28.098 --> 03:09:32.259]  He became a licensed certified public accountant, and it goes on from there.
[03:09:32.259 --> 03:09:35.860]  He left the practice of public accounting in 93 to accept appointment to the U.S.
[03:09:35.860 --> 03:09:42.943]  Department of Treasury, IRS Criminal Investigation Division as a special agent in addition to his investigative duties as a sworn federal law enforcement officer.
[03:09:42.943 --> 03:09:49.645]  Mr. Bannister was organized crime, drug enforcement task officer, and assistant forfeiture coordinator for the IRS Central
[03:09:50.185 --> 03:09:51.306]  California District.
[03:09:51.306 --> 03:09:55.929]  He also assisted with firearms and defensive tactics training as well as community outreach.
[03:09:55.929 --> 03:10:10.318]  Since leaving the IRS, Mr. Banisher has worked closely with Bob Schultz with the People Foundation to preserve our elected representatives, to investigate and correct the deceitful and often destructive tactics used by the agency against innocent, hard-working Americans.
[03:10:10.318 --> 03:10:12.540]  And they tried to then arrest him and indict him
[03:10:13.260 --> 03:10:17.482]  For telling people the IRS was a scam, and he beat them in court on that with a jury.
[03:10:17.482 --> 03:10:20.123]  So just an amazing individual, been through hell on earth.
[03:10:20.123 --> 03:10:24.265]  And it all started in 97, two years before he went public.
[03:10:24.265 --> 03:10:25.545]  He heard B.V.
[03:10:25.545 --> 03:10:30.907]  Kidd on mainstream radio explaining that the IRS was for private banks.
[03:10:30.907 --> 03:10:35.950]  And he spent two years researching it, just to recap for folks that don't know who he is.
[03:10:35.950 --> 03:10:39.351]  Found out it was real, went and talked to his superiors, and they said, you need to just resign.
[03:10:39.351 --> 03:10:40.612]  Get out of here.
[03:10:40.612 --> 03:10:41.412]  We don't want to hear about that.
[03:10:42.688 --> 03:10:46.411]  Now it's public that private banks own the world government.
[03:10:46.411 --> 03:10:47.712]  Bank of the world's being set up.
[03:10:47.712 --> 03:10:50.915]  You'll pay your carbon taxes to them.
[03:10:50.915 --> 03:10:52.696]  There's just no end to it.
[03:10:52.696 --> 03:10:54.598]  And so it's going to get worse and worse.
[03:10:54.598 --> 03:11:02.604]  And in the MIAC report, in this report by the Virginia Terrorism Threat Assessment, they mention Joe Bannister in some of these reports.
[03:11:02.604 --> 03:11:07.008]  They mention, you know, people going out and talking about the IRS.
[03:11:07.008 --> 03:11:09.009]  They mention the We the People group.
[03:11:09.790 --> 03:11:11.932]  They mentioned mainline libertarians.
[03:11:11.932 --> 03:11:15.695]  Look, as an American, you get involved and say, I don't want to live under tyranny.
[03:11:15.695 --> 03:11:18.118]  They say you're a terrorist.
[03:11:18.118 --> 03:11:22.401]  And now the new document that's out is saying gun owners are terrorists, period.
[03:11:22.401 --> 03:11:23.803]  And that they are coming for our guns.
[03:11:23.803 --> 03:11:26.085]  So, this is a rogue government, folks.
[03:11:26.085 --> 03:11:28.367]  And we're out, I mean, this is out of control.
[03:11:28.367 --> 03:11:29.968]  So I got Joe on today with us.
[03:11:29.968 --> 03:11:32.611]  Joe, great to have you back up with us.
[03:11:32.611 --> 03:11:33.231]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:11:33.231 --> 03:11:35.033]  It's great to hear your voice.
[03:11:35.894 --> 03:11:39.435]  So much is going on, so much is happening.
[03:11:39.435 --> 03:11:43.916]  When you first woke up to the New World Order many years ago, did you ever think it would get this crazy, this fast?
[03:11:43.916 --> 03:11:49.178]  I mean, I can't believe how ridiculously corrupt the government is.
[03:11:49.178 --> 03:11:53.619]  Well, I mean, as it's becoming more and more apparent, it's a race to the finish line.
[03:11:53.619 --> 03:12:01.381]  You were just saying that earlier in your show, and you say it every day, thankfully, because people need to keep hearing it.
[03:12:01.381 --> 03:12:05.542]  It's an absolute race to the finish line because they know that the people are waking up.
[03:12:06.429 --> 03:12:06.850]  I don't know.
[03:12:27.244 --> 03:12:27.844]  I don't think so.
[03:12:51.130 --> 03:13:00.737]  And of course now in my 40s, learning more about the bigger picture, as you've so eloquently shown to people.
[03:13:00.737 --> 03:13:05.801]  It's just that tip of the iceberg, you get to see just how big that iceberg is under the surface.
[03:13:07.648 --> 03:13:08.509]  Joe, I agree with you.
[03:13:08.509 --> 03:13:10.230]  I mean, I am dumbstruck.
[03:13:10.230 --> 03:13:11.270]  I am amazed.
[03:13:11.270 --> 03:13:13.832]  I had a caller call in and mention The Economist magazine.
[03:13:13.832 --> 03:13:16.014]  I wasn't aware of that article, but I'm covering here.
[03:13:16.014 --> 03:13:17.495]  I know it's true.
[03:13:17.495 --> 03:13:25.580]  Where they pay foreign companies, German, Dutch, Spanish, to come seize the roads and put toll roads on them.
[03:13:25.580 --> 03:13:33.666]  I mean, these bankers are so arrogant, they're not even bankers, they're just mafia scammers, that they get paid to grab the roads and taxes.
[03:13:34.626 --> 03:13:37.829]  And they're just stealing everything.
[03:13:37.829 --> 03:13:43.435]  They admittedly are breaking all the laws, stealing trillions for themselves right now with the bailout money.
[03:13:43.435 --> 03:13:52.944]  And I can have former top federal regulators on, like a professor we had on who put the SNL folks in prison, and he admits the whole government's criminal.
[03:13:52.944 --> 03:13:53.825]  They're taking over.
[03:13:56.128 --> 03:14:10.334]  I guess that's the good news, though, Joe, is that now people really can admit to themselves that we are totally dominated by a mafia, but the mafia doesn't care, and like you said, is racing to the finish line.
[03:14:10.334 --> 03:14:13.155]  Where do you see this going?
[03:14:13.155 --> 03:14:15.576]  Well, it's going to get worse.
[03:14:15.576 --> 03:14:20.258]  You know, the tyrants always turn to violence, right?
[03:14:20.258 --> 03:14:23.660]  I mean, the people, when our country was founded,
[03:14:24.246 --> 03:14:32.788]  There's plenty of evidence of non-violent petitioning, seeking redress, and how does it end up?
[03:14:32.788 --> 03:14:40.070]  The British try to steal the guns of the colonists, and the war is on.
[03:14:40.070 --> 03:14:42.251]  I listen to your show a lot.
[03:14:42.251 --> 03:14:46.032]  I even learned that you wanted to have me on the show for my son Ryan, a 17-year-old,
[03:14:48.367 --> 03:14:54.273]  So the good news also is that young people are dialed in to what's going on, thanks to you.
[03:14:54.273 --> 03:15:02.322]  I listen to your show regularly, but unfortunately I think history has shown that tyrants always go to
[03:15:03.553 --> 03:15:05.254]  To violence.
[03:15:05.254 --> 03:15:15.138]  They also use the surreptitious means, like I've seen on your website, as far as infiltration, co-opting of our efforts.
[03:15:15.138 --> 03:15:15.758]  And that's okay.
[03:15:15.758 --> 03:15:22.861]  I mean, we, you know, again, thanks to you, we know a lot of their tactics and we can be prepared for them.
[03:15:22.861 --> 03:15:25.642]  I think what we have to do is just look at people's conduct.
[03:15:26.933 --> 03:15:52.497]  And, you know, you so well document people's conduct, and I think that people who are searching for where to turn, for information, for leadership, just look at the conduct of the people and look back five years, ten years, fifteen years into their conduct, which is, you know, when you can talk about someone like Glenn Beck, look at their past.
[03:15:53.519 --> 03:16:07.343]  And if you see something that doesn't look right, you know, you better catch yourself, and maybe not be so, you know, still learn from them, but be careful not to follow them, and they may follow you, you might fall right over a cliff.
[03:16:07.343 --> 03:16:09.063]  That's right, you gotta judge a tree by its fruits.
[03:16:09.063 --> 03:16:15.205]  And look, I hate attacking Beck all day, and I get sophomoric about it, it's just that it's so obvious
[03:16:16.007 --> 03:16:18.269]  What a fraud he is and others.
[03:16:18.269 --> 03:16:21.050]  And I just am tired of seeing people get taken for a ride.
[03:16:21.050 --> 03:16:23.292]  Because I'm not that smart, Joe.
[03:16:23.292 --> 03:16:30.677]  I've just been doing this for now 14 plus years and doing it full time, you know, with the candle lit at both ends.
[03:16:30.677 --> 03:16:33.639]  And so I've learned all the silly little tricks they try.
[03:16:33.639 --> 03:16:35.120]  Doesn't mean I'm good at articulating it.
[03:16:35.120 --> 03:16:38.222]  There's a lot of other people smarter than I am.
[03:16:38.222 --> 03:16:42.505]  It's just again, I just get dumbfounded by how gullible people are.
[03:16:42.505 --> 03:16:44.106]  But like you said, it's a process.
[03:16:44.106 --> 03:16:45.787]  We were all once ignorant.
[03:16:46.868 --> 03:16:48.549]  About how things work.
[03:16:48.549 --> 03:16:49.570]  And I agree with you.
[03:16:49.570 --> 03:16:54.155]  The system is really getting aware of the awakening right now.
[03:16:54.155 --> 03:17:04.204]  Joe, I don't see any way they're going to get through what they're doing without starting a big war, staging some big terror attacks, really doing some horrible stuff.
[03:17:04.204 --> 03:17:08.067]  And that's why I tell people this isn't a game.
[03:17:10.389 --> 03:17:17.655]  I hear my rebroadcast sometimes where I'm screwing around having fun, because I'm just a regular guy too, and I get mad at myself and I go, you can't do that.
[03:17:17.655 --> 03:17:20.017]  This isn't a game.
[03:17:20.017 --> 03:17:26.463]  It hits me how real this is, and I'm sure it's hit you when they tried to put you in prison for telling people the IRS was a scam.
[03:17:28.421 --> 03:17:34.665]  Yeah, well, as we found, you know, different footage of you getting arrested.
[03:17:34.665 --> 03:17:38.508]  Sometimes you expect it to be, and other times not.
[03:17:38.508 --> 03:17:45.513]  You know, they have the jails, they've got legions of lawyers and deep pockets, but we have the truth.
[03:17:45.513 --> 03:17:52.257]  And I think that we, you know, I'm sure you're like me, we don't do this in a vacuum.
[03:17:52.257 --> 03:17:56.800]  We look for spiritual strength, we rely on our
[03:17:57.529 --> 03:18:09.919]  Almighty Father to guide us, to inspire us, to figure out how we're going to beat this back, because the truth will ultimately win in the end.
[03:18:09.919 --> 03:18:18.105]  Frankly, in my opinion, the country, of course, started out with many blessings and continued for many hundreds of years.
[03:18:18.820 --> 03:18:25.564]  But those blessings seem, at least the results of what we see in front of us, the evil that's out there.
[03:18:25.564 --> 03:18:40.893]  We need to get back to where God is just bestowing abundant blessings on our country, and maybe we need to look to ourselves, look to, I think I've heard you mention about the abortion that goes on in this country, the killing, the poisoning.
[03:18:40.893 --> 03:18:44.075]  Those are all evil things that are occurring.
[03:18:44.765 --> 03:18:48.030]  And we need almighty God's blessing on it.
[03:18:48.030 --> 03:18:48.751]  Absolutely.
[03:18:48.751 --> 03:18:52.657]  In fact, I mean folks, you reap what you sow.
[03:18:52.657 --> 03:18:57.884]  And people think they can just kill babies as a form of birth control and that 50 million dead babies...
[03:18:59.947 --> 03:19:01.548]  Won't come back on you.
[03:19:01.548 --> 03:19:09.151]  In a society that doesn't care about babies or old people or other folks, folks aren't going to care about you.
[03:19:09.151 --> 03:19:14.913]  And yes, the reason we're going to hell in a handbasket is because we have decided evil is cool.
[03:19:14.913 --> 03:19:18.015]  And killing babies is fun, and all of this is fun.
[03:19:18.015 --> 03:19:21.596]  And so folks, now we're going to go into something like Stalinist Russia.
[03:19:21.596 --> 03:19:23.377]  And I don't just say that for effect.
[03:19:24.676 --> 03:19:34.903]  I want listeners to understand, and Joe's experienced it, that the establishment that's in control is just as bad as Stalinist Communists.
[03:19:34.903 --> 03:19:36.584]  Absolutely.
[03:19:36.584 --> 03:19:41.587]  And I'm telling you, I'm telling you folks, your life means nothing to them.
[03:19:41.587 --> 03:19:44.169]  They enjoy hurting you.
[03:19:44.169 --> 03:19:47.251]  Joe Bannister, I want to try to shut up though, because I'm ranting here.
[03:19:47.251 --> 03:19:51.254]  I want to hear from you how the fight's going to expose the IRS,
[03:19:52.737 --> 03:20:02.659]  As an investigator, what the IRS really is, some of the new things that are coming up, and take some phone calls with Joe Bannister, and we'll plug your websites.
[03:20:02.659 --> 03:20:03.779]  Spring is here.
[03:20:03.779 --> 03:20:04.739]  Growing season.
[03:20:04.739 --> 03:20:06.939]  The economy is not getting any better.
[03:20:06.939 --> 03:20:08.660]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[03:20:08.660 --> 03:20:09.620]  Think about it.
[03:20:09.620 --> 03:20:13.721]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[03:20:13.721 --> 03:20:17.461]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[03:20:17.461 --> 03:20:19.362]  The country is running out of food.
[03:20:19.362 --> 03:20:21.862]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.

[03:20:59.095 --> 03:21:01.236]  OrganicaSeed.com today!
[03:21:02.051 --> 03:21:04.513]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[03:21:04.513 --> 03:21:08.316]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[03:21:08.316 --> 03:21:11.138]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[03:21:11.138 --> 03:21:18.344]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[03:21:18.464 --> 03:21:19.105]  We're good to go.
[03:21:34.924 --> 03:21:39.067]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[03:21:39.067 --> 03:21:44.892]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnobel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[03:21:44.892 --> 03:21:49.936]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[03:21:49.936 --> 03:21:54.379]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[03:21:54.379 --> 03:21:57.041]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[03:21:57.041 --> 03:21:57.501]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[03:22:02.614 --> 03:22:05.189]  In the New World Order's war against humanity.
[03:22:05.811 --> 03:22:08.652]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:22:08.652 --> 03:22:14.533]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:22:14.533 --> 03:22:21.035]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:22:21.035 --> 03:22:22.995]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:22:22.995 --> 03:22:25.456]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:22:25.456 --> 03:22:35.198]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[03:22:35.658 --> 03:22:38.641]  That's fascism.
[03:22:38.641 --> 03:22:40.322]  It's not about left or right.
[03:22:40.322 --> 03:22:42.183]  It's about a one world government.
[03:22:42.183 --> 03:22:49.089]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:22:49.089 --> 03:22:57.356]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:22:57.356 --> 03:22:58.917]  The Obama Deception.
[03:22:58.917 --> 03:23:00.118]  The people strike back.
[03:23:01.815 --> 03:23:03.497]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[03:23:03.497 --> 03:23:05.239]  What does humidity mean to you?
[03:23:05.239 --> 03:23:07.921]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[03:23:07.921 --> 03:23:13.066]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[03:23:13.066 --> 03:23:16.250]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[03:23:16.250 --> 03:23:19.753]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.

[03:24:03.086 --> 03:24:08.147]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:08.903 --> 03:24:18.720]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:24:18.720 --> 03:24:20.884]  Joe, when I was thinking about you a few weeks ago...
[03:24:24.781 --> 03:24:29.445]  The big question I wanted to ask you about was the MIAC report, which I'm sure you've read and seen.
[03:24:29.445 --> 03:24:39.294]  And all these other federal reports that are put out where they say mainline libertarians, constitutionalists, those protesting the Fed, it turns out we have the Army spying on us.
[03:24:39.294 --> 03:24:44.659]  You're mentioned in some of these documents, other people are mentioned, there's a whole bunch of them here.
[03:24:44.659 --> 03:24:47.362]  They mention the We the People Foundation, which is just out educating
[03:24:48.547 --> 03:25:07.002]  And then everywhere we go, we have police and security guards come up in D.C., New York, just happened in Kansas City, they're 150 yards away from the private Federal Reserve building, and the federal security guards in little Nazi outfits come over and say, we're going to arrest you if you don't tell us who you are and then leave.
[03:25:07.002 --> 03:25:11.086]  It's just, it's just, this isn't freedom.
[03:25:11.086 --> 03:25:16.230]  What's the process with the police and military right now with these reports?
[03:25:16.230 --> 03:25:17.291]  A, are they buying them?
[03:25:19.031 --> 03:25:33.927]  And then B, how do they deal with the reports saying there's no such thing as a new world order, global government, the conspiracy theorists, terrorists believe they're going to set up a bank of the world, and then meanwhile that's being announced all over the news that it is happening.
[03:25:33.927 --> 03:25:36.330]  I mean, how do police and military deal with the doublespeak?
[03:25:37.742 --> 03:25:43.567]  Well, as I'm sure you're aware, Alex, there's a hierarchy in most law enforcement agencies, right?
[03:25:43.567 --> 03:25:50.352]  You've got the people at the top who are, you know, I shouldn't be broad-brushing, but I mean largely bought and paid for.
[03:25:50.352 --> 03:25:55.156]  Then you have the rank-and-file people who live regular lives like you and me.
[03:25:55.156 --> 03:26:06.205]  And what the ivory tower hierarchy wants is that the rank-and-file will just read these memos, these pamphlets, these training manuals.
[03:26:06.855 --> 03:26:10.716]  And that's their only source of information.
[03:26:10.716 --> 03:26:15.738]  And that's, I think, what the hierarchy wants, and it's what they expect.
[03:26:15.738 --> 03:26:28.842]  But fortunately with the Internet, and because there are still plenty of rank-and-file people that have brains and use them, they go out and they find other information, or their friends and relatives and neighbors share information with them.
[03:26:29.667 --> 03:26:30.007]  I don't know.
[03:26:45.769 --> 03:26:47.429]  Uh, before I went in there.
[03:26:47.429 --> 03:26:50.570]  So when I went in there, it was such a culture shock.
[03:26:50.570 --> 03:26:56.171]  Uh, unlike people that might, you know, graduate from college and go right into the IRS and spend a career there.
[03:26:56.171 --> 03:27:08.033]  So I had a perspective just because I was out in the real world, uh, you know, researching tax law, uh, dealing with clients who were having, you know, tax struggles or finance.
[03:27:08.033 --> 03:27:11.694]  The IRS was absolutely destroying them for no good reason.
[03:27:12.403 --> 03:27:17.907]  I mean, when I first got my job at the IRS, part of my background investigation was an audit.
[03:27:17.907 --> 03:27:27.896]  They audited me for three years, and the auditor actually tried to accuse me of cheating on about $10,000 worth of tax.
[03:27:27.896 --> 03:27:39.365]  So I had to put my thinking cap on and fight an IRS auditor just to get a job with the IRS, and I ended up getting a $1,000 refund because I found out I was even too conservative.
[03:27:40.031 --> 03:27:46.199]  But that, you know, they told me before the audit that they're going to treat you just like they do every other taxpayer, and boy, they sure did.
[03:27:46.199 --> 03:27:47.300]  They wanted to rip me off.
[03:27:47.967 --> 03:27:49.828]  But I mean, that's not the case now.
[03:27:49.828 --> 03:27:52.629]  Geithner was told, you've got to pay back this hundred-and-something fallon.
[03:27:52.629 --> 03:27:54.910]  He says, no, I'm not going to do it.
[03:27:54.910 --> 03:28:14.760]  And now they have a Treasury Secretary who doesn't pay taxes, and it's come out that most of Obama's administration just doesn't bother to pay, and that under the last few administrations, they've gotten rid of most of the IRS enforcers against big international corporations where all the money's at, and they're pointing them at blue-collar people, I guess just to waste their time.
[03:28:16.427 --> 03:28:32.131]  Sure, to make you chase your tail, and they know that they can make the average person's life miserable, but as you're well aware and have said many times, you know, isn't that what socialism and communism and all these collectivist political systems are about?
[03:28:32.131 --> 03:28:34.412]  It's about double standards, right?
[03:28:34.412 --> 03:28:34.792]  Yes.
[03:28:34.792 --> 03:28:40.033]  The people, they get into power claiming that we're going to make everything equal and everybody happy,
[03:28:40.529 --> 03:28:46.512]  And then as soon as they're in power, they don't walk the walk, they don't live the way everyone else lives.
[03:28:46.512 --> 03:28:51.935]  And that's the lie that you are so good at telling people, and God bless you for doing it.
[03:28:51.935 --> 03:28:55.457]  Oh, I'm not that good at it, Joe.
[03:28:55.457 --> 03:28:57.478]  What I'm not good at is controlling myself, though.
[03:28:57.478 --> 03:28:59.999]  I mean, I'm getting sick of these people.
[03:28:59.999 --> 03:29:03.741]  For me, Alex, I just love listening to you.
[03:29:04.608 --> 03:29:13.412]  You get, you know, you get people's heart pounding and, you know, darn it, I think you gotta use something to get people out of their easy chair.
[03:29:13.412 --> 03:29:18.055]  And I think I can tell you're sincere and I think most people can tell that.
[03:29:18.055 --> 03:29:19.995]  You can tell when someone's sincere.
[03:29:19.995 --> 03:29:21.536]  You're sincerely upset.
[03:29:21.536 --> 03:29:24.338]  You're sincerely worried about your fellow man.
[03:29:24.338 --> 03:29:26.379]  And so am I. And that's why we do what we do.
[03:29:26.379 --> 03:29:30.981]  Well, let's come back and get into solutions and where all this goes and take some calls.
[03:29:33.427 --> 03:29:35.969]  I'm just getting more and more upset.
[03:29:35.969 --> 03:29:37.570]  And by upset, it's a quickening.
[03:29:37.570 --> 03:29:39.252]  I know they're getting ready to stage more terror.
[03:29:39.252 --> 03:29:41.634]  I can just see all the pieces coming together.
[03:29:41.634 --> 03:29:47.819]  And I just can't believe we have to be ruled by scumbag, control-freak criminals, Joe.
[03:29:47.819 --> 03:29:49.200]  Joe Bannister's our guest.
[03:29:49.200 --> 03:29:50.221]  He's a great American hero.
[03:29:50.221 --> 03:29:51.201]  We'll talk to him when we get back.
[03:29:51.201 --> 03:29:52.522]  Long segment coming up.
[03:29:52.522 --> 03:29:53.923]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.923 --> 03:29:56.446]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.446 --> 03:29:59.148]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.625 --> 03:30:09.490]  Did you know that the new energy czar wants to control how much power your electrical company allows you to have?
[03:30:09.490 --> 03:30:10.431]  It's true.
[03:30:10.431 --> 03:30:16.015]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:30:16.015 --> 03:30:17.396]  Not if, but when.
[03:30:19.884 --> 03:30:20.245]  Let's do it!
[03:30:35.379 --> 03:30:42.804]  This generator is solar powered, complete with battery backup, has no moving parts to wear out or break, and requires no gas.
[03:30:42.804 --> 03:30:46.807]  Don't wait for the Energy Czar to cut your power or raise your rates.
[03:30:46.807 --> 03:30:49.249]  Produce your own electricity for free.
[03:30:49.249 --> 03:30:51.511]  Go to MySolarBackup.com.
[03:30:51.511 --> 03:30:54.093]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[03:30:54.093 --> 03:30:54.593]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[03:30:54.593 --> 03:30:54.633]  877-327-0365.
[03:31:02.768 --> 03:31:08.590]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:31:08.590 --> 03:31:16.152]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[03:31:16.152 --> 03:31:22.314]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:31:22.754 --> 03:31:24.716]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:31:24.716 --> 03:31:27.218]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:31:27.218 --> 03:31:38.807]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:31:38.807 --> 03:31:40.468]  It's not about left or right.
[03:31:40.468 --> 03:31:42.330]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:31:42.330 --> 03:31:48.555]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:31:49.241 --> 03:31:57.492]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:31:57.492 --> 03:31:59.074]  The Obama Deception.
[03:31:59.074 --> 03:32:02.438]  The people strike back.
[03:32:02.438 --> 03:32:05.042]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[03:32:05.658 --> 03:32:09.000]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[03:32:09.000 --> 03:32:12.761]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[03:32:12.761 --> 03:32:19.344]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[03:32:19.344 --> 03:32:24.567]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[03:32:24.567 --> 03:32:31.270]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[03:32:31.590 --> 03:32:32.691]  Need something more?
[03:32:32.691 --> 03:32:36.636]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.
[03:32:36.636 --> 03:32:44.946]  Mr. Defense also carries the largest selection of air tasers, knives, self-defense keychains, swords, batons, survival, spy, and tactical gear.

[03:32:53.016 --> 03:32:54.719]  That's 1-800-313-6400 for all of your self-defense needs today!
[03:33:09.448 --> 03:33:18.097]  I'll tell you about a few of our sponsors.
[03:33:18.097 --> 03:33:19.599]  We're going right back to Joe Bannister.
[03:33:19.599 --> 03:33:22.562]  One of them is My Solar Backup.
[03:33:22.562 --> 03:33:24.805]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[03:33:24.805 --> 03:33:27.007]  Hurricanes, snow, ice storms.
[03:33:27.007 --> 03:33:28.849]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid.
[03:33:28.849 --> 03:33:30.090]  And here's a good way to do just that.
[03:33:31.920 --> 03:33:33.121]  The Solar Power Generator.
[03:33:33.121 --> 03:33:38.286]  It's designed to provide 1,800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[03:33:38.286 --> 03:33:46.694]  Yet, you get an emergency power backup kit, which consists of the PowerSource 1800 power plant, a high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[03:33:47.608 --> 03:33:53.372]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in a blackout gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[03:33:53.372 --> 03:33:57.414]  The solar generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[03:33:57.414 --> 03:33:59.395]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[03:33:59.395 --> 03:34:02.657]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move today.
[03:34:02.657 --> 03:34:04.578]  MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[03:34:04.578 --> 03:34:04.619]  877-327-0365.
[03:34:12.283 --> 03:34:13.724]  One other sponsor I want to tell you about.
[03:34:13.724 --> 03:34:16.686]  Again, it's all about preparedness in these insane times.
[03:34:16.686 --> 03:34:20.349]  You will never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:34:20.349 --> 03:34:23.652]  The system, on record, the UN has said they will use food as a weapon.
[03:34:24.782 --> 03:34:27.164]  There is no doubt these criminals may go for broke.
[03:34:27.164 --> 03:34:32.668]  They're going for broke, but it may get into a completely insane situation with the economy alone.
[03:34:32.668 --> 03:34:34.769]  I believe everybody should get high quality storable foods.
[03:34:34.769 --> 03:34:36.911]  This is where I got my storable foods.
[03:34:36.911 --> 03:34:41.615]  I bought them from a couple different places and liked this one the best and found out they were the biggest and oldest company out there.
[03:34:41.615 --> 03:34:44.917]  So eFoodsDirect.com, the number to give them a call is 800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or again,
[03:34:50.601 --> 03:34:52.262]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:34:52.262 --> 03:34:55.683]  Call, get a free brochure, catalog, whatever you do, get prepared.
[03:34:55.683 --> 03:35:01.064]  Speaking of websites, books, materials, information, Joe Bannister, you've done just so much great work.
[03:35:01.064 --> 03:35:06.446]  Where's the best place for folks to check out the work and material that you've put out and done?
[03:35:08.250 --> 03:35:21.322]  Well, a lot of it is just, you know, I just kind of go out and speak when I'm invited, so there's a lot of videos up on YouTube, etc., but FreedomAboveFortune.com has always been my website.
[03:35:21.322 --> 03:35:27.728]  There's a mailing list that people can join there, you know, if they are concerned about lists, you know, go get a throw-down address.
[03:35:29.244 --> 03:35:38.071]  On Yahoo and join the list, but I mean I do send out alerts and updates as to what's going on, at least from my neck of the woods.
[03:35:38.071 --> 03:35:44.076]  And so FreedomAboveFortune.com along the left-hand side, there's all kinds of good information there.
[03:35:44.076 --> 03:35:53.423]  I'm planning on releasing some videos about protecting your rights and the IRS and their bag of dirty tricks, you know, what kind of dirty tricks they pull out to people.
[03:35:54.153 --> 03:36:11.444]  Hey, when you beat them, when they arrested you or indicted you for telling people about the fraud and it went to trial, can you just briefly recap what happened there and then what they did when you beat them?
[03:36:11.444 --> 03:36:13.545]  Well, they started investigating me.
[03:36:13.545 --> 03:36:14.926]  I resigned in 99.
[03:36:14.926 --> 03:36:17.027]  They started investigating me criminally in 2001.
[03:36:18.737 --> 03:36:25.584]  November of 2004, I was indicted and arrested by, you know, agents I used to work with.
[03:36:25.584 --> 03:36:29.007]  Two-hour car ride up to Sacramento to the U.S.
[03:36:29.007 --> 03:36:31.570]  Marshals lockup.
[03:36:31.570 --> 03:36:34.073]  Did they put you in handcuffs?
[03:36:34.073 --> 03:36:34.593]  They cuffed me.
[03:36:34.593 --> 03:36:36.735]  They cuffed me in the front and gave me some water.
[03:36:36.735 --> 03:36:37.997]  They were real kind to me.
[03:36:37.997 --> 03:36:38.577]  What did they say?
[03:36:38.577 --> 03:36:40.059]  Hey, Joe, we're here to arrest you.
[03:36:40.059 --> 03:36:40.839]  You've been talking.
[03:36:40.839 --> 03:36:42.041]  You're not allowed to do that in America.
[03:36:42.751 --> 03:36:55.680]  Yeah, well they came into my house with guns drawn, and my attitude, which is so funny when they put my name in these reports and things, I kind of thought of it like a training exercise.
[03:36:55.680 --> 03:37:02.264]  I laughed because when I was at the IRS, Alex, as I said, I was at least a Second Amendment supporter, I was aware of that.
[03:37:02.264 --> 03:37:07.848]  And so I had bumper stickers in my cubicle that said, you know, fear the government that fears your guns.
[03:37:08.527 --> 03:37:12.828]  The experts agree gun control works with the pictures of Stalin and Mao.
[03:37:12.828 --> 03:37:19.250]  And so whenever we'd have training exercises, they'd make me the tax protester.
[03:37:19.250 --> 03:37:21.930]  And I would get hit with the soap pellets.
[03:37:21.930 --> 03:37:28.412]  So when they came to arrest me, I really just kind of pictured myself in another training exercise.
[03:37:28.412 --> 03:37:30.032]  I showed my hands.
[03:37:30.032 --> 03:37:32.513]  You know, I knew the drill because I'd trained it many times.
[03:37:34.113 --> 03:37:34.993]  And off I went.
[03:37:34.993 --> 03:37:43.478]  But the prosecutor tried to keep me in jail, saying that I was a flight risk, and the judge looked at him like he was a nut, because there was no evidence that I was.
[03:37:43.478 --> 03:37:49.540]  So the judge released me, and I had about seven months to prepare for my trial, which was in June of 2005.
[03:37:49.540 --> 03:37:58.765]  I was charged with conspiring to defraud the United States of America, and for preparing three false amended tax returns.
[03:37:59.720 --> 03:38:03.903]  They didn't address my personal situation whatsoever.
[03:38:03.903 --> 03:38:15.893]  They were trying to join me to a client and claim that our efforts to get a refund from the IRS was a conspiracy and involved false tax returns.
[03:38:15.893 --> 03:38:26.441]  Now, the thing is that the IRS lays out what it claims is the correct way to do things with them, and that is to pay the tax first and
[03:38:27.142 --> 03:38:28.583]  Sue for a refund.
[03:38:28.583 --> 03:38:39.012]  Well, we went chapter and verse in exactly what they lay out to sue for a refund, and that's what myself and my client were prosecuted for.
[03:38:39.012 --> 03:38:44.696]  To conspire against the United States for following the IRS's rulebook and seeking a refund.
[03:38:44.696 --> 03:38:54.965]  And the jury, they're in Sacramento, California, I learned talking to them after I was acquitted, they were just astounded that this case was even brought against me.
[03:38:55.799 --> 03:39:01.582]  Because all of the evidence kept showing what a good guy I was.
[03:39:01.582 --> 03:39:03.463]  I mean, what a good CPA I was.
[03:39:03.463 --> 03:39:05.664]  I was going to bat for my client.
[03:39:05.664 --> 03:39:12.288]  Everything that I submitted was right out of their own manuals, right out of the regulations, right out of the statutes.
[03:39:12.288 --> 03:39:18.131]  And they said, well, Joe, why did they bring up so much evidence that made you look so good?
[03:39:18.131 --> 03:39:21.913]  I said, well, most of their evidence, their documentary evidence, came from me.
[03:39:21.913 --> 03:39:24.575]  Because they issued me a grand jury subpoena.
[03:39:25.604 --> 03:39:31.146]  And a CPA does not have Fifth Amendment protection in their workpapers.
[03:39:31.146 --> 03:39:35.847]  So I had to give them these stacks of workpapers from my efforts.
[03:39:35.847 --> 03:39:38.168]  And that's what they used in the trial.
[03:39:38.168 --> 03:39:46.970]  They also used a two-hour video, which is probably on the Internet, where I spoke to the employees of my client's business.
[03:39:46.970 --> 03:39:54.012]  And I just went through a two-hour litany of the reason that I left the IRS and what I learned.
[03:39:54.671 --> 03:40:10.823]  And the government used that tape in the trial and I guess because they were so devoid of anything, you know, any evidence, they were trying to convince the jury that this video showed me in the act.
[03:40:10.823 --> 03:40:14.746]  And the jury wanted to see the video a second time during deliberations because
[03:40:15.325 --> 03:40:17.626]  They could see that I was sincere.
[03:40:17.626 --> 03:40:21.947]  I was, you know, I was looking at actual documents.
[03:40:21.947 --> 03:40:25.028]  I mean, there was just no BS about my presentation.
[03:40:25.028 --> 03:40:33.991]  Well, for those that don't know, they've written the Income Tax Code, and correct me if I'm wrong, but interviewing you and other experts, where the big banks and offshore corporations get out of paying it.
[03:40:33.991 --> 03:40:36.352]  So there's loopholes in there for them.
[03:40:36.352 --> 03:40:39.833]  It's all paid into the IRS to go on interest to the debt of the private bankers.
[03:40:39.833 --> 03:40:41.413]  We didn't have it until 1913.
[03:40:41.413 --> 03:40:42.674]  It was only about one percent.
[03:40:43.394 --> 03:41:06.784]  until the fifties we built this country without it now it's the parasite dragging us down uh... and uh... as the public begins to learn about this what are they going to do it but sorry go ahead jim uh... well yeah i mean it it is the the parasite i mean interestingly uh... there's a website called here liberty dot com like h e a r
[03:41:07.423 --> 03:41:10.985]  And there's a T. Coleman Andrews interview that U.S.
[03:41:10.985 --> 03:41:25.331]  News & World Report did in 1956, and Mr. Andrews was a former IRS commissioner, and you should read how he lambasted the very agency that he was commissioner of and the income tax.
[03:41:25.331 --> 03:41:31.234]  You know, at least back in the 50s, there were still people that were in government that recognized communism when they saw it.
[03:41:33.248 --> 03:41:41.555]  So, yeah, it's like the chameleon keeps changing its spots, changing its colors, but it can't change them fast enough.
[03:41:41.555 --> 03:41:43.577]  You know, the American people are catching on.
[03:41:43.577 --> 03:41:45.658]  Well, look at what government's doing now.
[03:41:45.658 --> 03:41:51.563]  It's openly being run by private banks who are literally stolen $12.8 trillion.
[03:41:51.563 --> 03:41:56.947]  Just the number is almost the GDP, $13 trillion is the GDP.
[03:41:56.947 --> 03:42:00.650]  And they're saying, Obama says, I'm cutting government in half.
[03:42:01.678 --> 03:42:02.518]  Bush tripled it.
[03:42:02.518 --> 03:42:09.401]  He's going to more than double it in one year.
[03:42:09.401 --> 03:42:11.501]  I mean, just the level of lying.
[03:42:11.501 --> 03:42:15.823]  I mean, folks would think that I couldn't be amazed anymore by the lying.
[03:42:15.823 --> 03:42:21.405]  I am really getting speechless, Joe Bannister, because it's so ridiculous how corrupt they are.
[03:42:21.405 --> 03:42:31.008]  But then if you study, I guess, criminology like you've done, and I've done it as a layman, when criminals and psychos don't get caught and get away with it, don't they always just get wilder and wilder?
[03:42:32.094 --> 03:42:46.162]  That's exactly right, and I think the American people, we all collectively, you and I and many people, all your production team, we're working our butts off as much as we can, and when our eyes were opened, we get to work.
[03:42:46.162 --> 03:42:51.405]  But other people's eyes are opened and they go back to their easy chair, and this is a group effort.
[03:42:54.092 --> 03:42:58.775]  People who are just sitting around doing nothing, you've got to do something.
[03:42:58.775 --> 03:43:02.677]  My recommendation, as always, first, is prayer.
[03:43:02.677 --> 03:43:10.302]  I believe that collectively we've offended God greatly, and we need to get back to where we're not doing that.
[03:43:10.302 --> 03:43:14.424]  But also watch out for discouragement.
[03:43:14.424 --> 03:43:19.547]  When you feel like the discouragement is coming on, that's the evil forces trying to disarm you.
[03:43:20.456 --> 03:43:23.838]  Uh, and it's gonna, everybody's gonna feel that discouragement, but, you know, reject it.
[03:43:23.838 --> 03:43:24.539]  I agree.
[03:43:24.539 --> 03:43:25.679]  And move forward.
[03:43:25.679 --> 03:43:29.282]  I agree, it's just... Go ahead.
[03:43:29.282 --> 03:43:45.952]  Uh, and I, as I say, I do listen to your show pretty frequently, and you mentioned Hogan's Heroes, and I talk to people about Hogan's Heroes because, look at it this way, you have these prisoners of war, the Germans thought that they were this compliant, these compliant slaves who were
[03:43:46.562 --> 03:43:47.122]  Immobilize.
[03:44:03.820 --> 03:44:11.666]  But every person can find something that they can do to join this effort to wreak havoc to these tyrants.
[03:44:11.666 --> 03:44:15.669]  And I'm convinced everyone can play a role.
[03:44:15.669 --> 03:44:17.410]  But stealth is the key.
[03:44:17.410 --> 03:44:23.255]  People like you and me, stealth isn't an option, but there's plenty of people that can use stealth.
[03:44:23.255 --> 03:44:28.538]  Don't wear your support for Ron Paul on your sleeve or your bumper sticker like Ann Coulter does.
[03:44:30.840 --> 03:44:33.563]  Do the job that needs to get done and do it in stealth.
[03:44:51.081 --> 03:44:56.884]  We are going to be the majority, we're almost there, because everything we talked about is coming true.
[03:44:56.884 --> 03:45:08.890]  What do you think the average police officer, and I've talked to a lot of them, I know what their view is, but I mean, your take on talking to them, or your average federal person, they tell them for decades there's no new world order.
[03:45:08.890 --> 03:45:12.251]  And it doesn't exist and it's not happening.
[03:45:12.251 --> 03:45:13.392]  And then suddenly,
[03:45:15.515 --> 03:45:20.584]  Uh, they come right out on the news and say there is a world government, but it's going to save you from the economic downturn.
[03:45:20.584 --> 03:45:27.196]  I've been told that that's really what's waking government people up, is, wait a minute, you said none of this existed, and now you're telling me it's good.
[03:45:28.797 --> 03:45:47.913]  Right, and I think, you know, maybe you've already done it or you're in the process of doing it, but I mean, what needs to be done is a viral, you know, DVD where you can show that, you know, when you said what you said 10 years ago, 15 years ago, and show that progression, both what you've been saying
[03:45:48.513 --> 03:46:01.246]  You know, and people trying to expose the truth about the New World Order, and what the other side has been saying, so that within 45 or 90 minutes, people can see that progression of lies.
[03:46:01.246 --> 03:46:10.135]  And I think, I mean, I think there's a lot of law enforcement people that aren't, you know, they've dealt with their chief, they've dealt with the assistant chief, or the deputy,
[03:46:11.232 --> 03:46:14.563]  Lieutenant in the Sheriff's Department and the politics that are involved.
[03:46:14.563 --> 03:46:18.415]  I don't think it's a big stretch for them to realize that people at the top
[03:46:18.942 --> 03:46:22.745]  Don't care about the rank-and-file, and largely they don't even care about the citizens.
[03:46:22.745 --> 03:46:26.167]  They just care about their own pension and paycheck, and their own careers.
[03:46:26.167 --> 03:46:40.778]  Exactly, and that becomes a culture of protecting the other corrupt people until the crimes get worse and worse, but nobody can blow the whistle, because it'll bring us all down, and that's what causes societies to implode and fall in on themselves, and yes,
[03:46:41.559 --> 03:46:46.023]  We have hundreds of shows I've done, thousands of radio shows, hundreds of TV shows.
[03:46:46.023 --> 03:47:07.299]  I just haven't had the crew to go back and watch all of that, listen to all of that, but I've thought about making that film, showing the predictions I made, the predictions other people made, and then, what's even harder, I remember seeing it and reading it, going back and finding all the news reports where they said that we were lying, and then, so show how they were lying, how we were telling the truth, and how it's all basically happening now.
[03:47:07.299 --> 03:47:09.401]  That would be extremely, extremely effective.
[03:47:09.981 --> 03:47:11.982]  It's like I predicted what Glenn Beck was going to do the other night.
[03:47:11.982 --> 03:47:15.824]  It wasn't hard to do, but that really impresses people.
[03:47:15.824 --> 03:47:17.785]  They think it's like magic or something, and it's not.
[03:47:17.785 --> 03:47:21.167]  I mean, these people have like a shake and bake.
[03:47:21.167 --> 03:47:25.349]  You know, it's like the directions to making pancakes on the back of a box.
[03:47:25.349 --> 03:47:27.330]  I mean, I know what they're going to do.
[03:47:27.330 --> 03:47:30.632]  I want to bring just Ted Anderson up for about three minutes here, real fast, Joe Bannister.
[03:47:30.632 --> 03:47:37.356]  We're going to come back in the final segment and jam in a few phone calls, but I do want to plug your website, and that's freedomabovefortune.com, correct?
[03:47:38.001 --> 03:47:38.601]  That's correct.
[03:47:38.601 --> 03:47:39.462]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:47:39.462 --> 03:47:39.902]  Oh, you bet.
[03:47:39.902 --> 03:47:41.163]  We've got that up on screen, folks.
[03:47:41.163 --> 03:47:41.844]  We need to support you.
[03:47:41.844 --> 03:47:43.645]  Very, very valiant.
[03:47:43.645 --> 03:47:53.473]  And I'm also told that you are going to be going out to the big event that's coming up this next weekend in Lexington, Massachusetts.
[03:47:53.473 --> 03:47:56.375]  I believe you're on the list to speak, aren't you?
[03:47:56.375 --> 03:48:01.299]  No, but I'll be at the April 15th TruthAttack.org.
[03:48:01.299 --> 03:48:01.759]  That's it.
[03:48:01.759 --> 03:48:02.299]  I get it all.
[03:48:02.299 --> 03:48:03.800]  It all runs together.
[03:48:03.800 --> 03:48:05.602]  Where is that TruthAttack.org thing going to be?
[03:48:06.657 --> 03:48:10.500]  Uh, well it's all over the country, uh, 750 post offices last year.
[03:48:10.500 --> 03:48:15.664]  I'm going to be in the Reno and Carson City, Nevada, uh, post offices on the 15th.
[03:48:15.664 --> 03:48:17.886]  Um, so, you know, certainly love to see people.
[03:48:17.886 --> 03:48:24.151]  And our job, of course, is to wake up all the Fox News people that are going to be there.
[03:48:24.151 --> 03:48:24.952]  Absolutely.
[03:48:24.952 --> 03:48:32.217]  I think about 750 places, citizens out in front of the news cameras as we take over the media, as we take over the coverage.
[03:48:32.217 --> 03:48:34.299]  Same thing with the Tea Party, same things with all of it.
[03:48:34.299 --> 03:48:34.979]  We're on the march.
[03:48:36.019 --> 03:48:38.640]  Empire is on the run, and I salute every one of you out there.
[03:48:38.640 --> 03:48:40.380]  That's why we're having this effect.
[03:48:40.380 --> 03:48:45.921]  Real fast, Ted Anderson, I want to get you on today, because gold is up 15-something bucks last time I checked.
[03:48:45.921 --> 03:48:50.582]  You've got gold and silver, again, that you buy when it's low, you keep the price low when it's high.
[03:48:50.582 --> 03:48:52.743]  That's how you beat everybody out there in the industry.
[03:48:52.743 --> 03:48:55.963]  So I wanted to bring you on just for a minute or two, Ted, to tell folks about today's offer.
[03:48:55.963 --> 03:48:58.584]  Alex, thanks for having me up again.
[03:48:58.584 --> 03:49:03.185]  I tell you, gold did hit about $860, and I was buying as much as I could at that point.
[03:49:03.740 --> 03:49:09.206]  I did get into some Franks at $2.14 and I've got the British Sovereigns at $2.67.
[03:49:09.206 --> 03:49:16.854]  But one of the things I ran into here, interestingly enough just here now, is the Lakota coin, the Lakota Silver Round.
[03:49:16.854 --> 03:49:20.417]  Most everybody is selling them from $20 to $25.
[03:49:20.417 --> 03:49:22.279]  And I have the Lakota Silver Rounds right now at $18.50.
[03:49:24.925 --> 03:49:30.570]  That's that coin that they put the $50 on and it's that Sovereign Nation Lakota coin.
[03:49:30.570 --> 03:49:40.419]  I think it's a real neat little offer and plus also to get them at $18.50 I think that is a really good price to be getting into one ounce silver rounds.
[03:49:40.419 --> 03:49:43.102]  But basically right now at this time you're right on target Alex.
[03:49:43.567 --> 03:49:51.518]  The Franks currently right now at 214, that's the same coin that was at 227 here just about 3-4 weeks ago.
[03:49:51.518 --> 03:49:57.006]  British Sovereigns at 267, same coin that was at 290 here just a few weeks ago.
[03:49:57.006 --> 03:49:59.430]  So obviously, yeah, the time is now to be buying in.
[03:49:59.966 --> 03:50:05.069]  But that Lakota coin at $18.50, that's a good price for a silver run.
[03:50:05.069 --> 03:50:06.870]  Ted, will you save me five of those?
[03:50:06.870 --> 03:50:08.190]  Yeah, I'd be happy to, of course.
[03:50:08.190 --> 03:50:11.672]  Yeah, definitely, because these are collector coins.
[03:50:11.672 --> 03:50:17.555]  It's kind of like the Ron Paul Liberty coin that goes for $300, you can buy for $16.
[03:50:17.555 --> 03:50:21.117]  These things really go up, and so get that Lakota Nation coin, 1-800-686-7000.
[03:50:23.058 --> 03:50:27.424]  Two, two, three, seven, eight hundred, six, eight, six, two, two, three, seven.
[03:50:27.424 --> 03:50:29.487]  The brokers will be there until tonight.
[03:50:29.487 --> 03:50:30.348]  How much is gold up?
[03:50:30.348 --> 03:50:32.090]  I know it was climbing last time I checked.
[03:50:32.090 --> 03:50:34.193]  Well, I tell you, it hit almost $900 an ounce.
[03:50:34.193 --> 03:50:34.874]  It actually went over $950.
[03:50:34.874 --> 03:50:35.375]  Right now it's up...
[03:50:39.360 --> 03:50:42.962]  $12.60 at the moment.
[03:50:42.962 --> 03:50:43.522]  1-800-686-2237.
[03:50:43.522 --> 03:50:45.564]  And that's with all the banker manipulation.
[03:50:45.564 --> 03:50:47.745]  They're killing the dollar, folks.
[03:50:47.745 --> 03:50:49.846]  It's a great time to get into precious metals.
[03:50:49.846 --> 03:50:52.108]  800-686-2237.
[03:50:52.108 --> 03:50:52.928]  Thank you, Ted.
[03:50:52.928 --> 03:50:54.049]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[03:50:54.049 --> 03:50:54.329]  You bet.
[03:50:54.329 --> 03:50:55.090]  Joe Banas is our guest.
[03:50:55.090 --> 03:50:57.091]  Stay with us.
[03:51:02.600 --> 03:51:04.062]  So you want to stop smoking.
[03:51:04.062 --> 03:51:05.343]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[03:51:05.343 --> 03:51:08.226]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[03:51:08.226 --> 03:51:12.211]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[03:51:12.211 --> 03:51:15.995]  And if and only if you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it?
[03:51:15.995 --> 03:51:17.997]  Most likely, if you tried this, you'd be arrested.
[03:51:17.997 --> 03:51:21.882]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the smoke-free free trial offer is.
[03:51:22.302 --> 03:51:29.366]  Smokefree is a complete all-natural stop smoking system and when you call today they'll send you a 30-day supply of the program absolutely free.
[03:51:29.366 --> 03:51:37.391]  This program eliminates withdrawals and cravings and includes a 30-day supply of the Smokefree capsules, a guide to living smoke-free book, and audio support program.
[03:51:37.731 --> 03:51:39.092]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[03:52:06.101 --> 03:52:08.942]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.942 --> 03:52:14.803]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.803 --> 03:52:21.225]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:21.225 --> 03:52:23.285]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:23.285 --> 03:52:25.746]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.746 --> 03:52:35.488]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[03:52:35.956 --> 03:52:38.937]  That's fascism.
[03:52:38.937 --> 03:52:40.598]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.598 --> 03:52:42.458]  It's about a one world government.
[03:52:42.458 --> 03:52:49.361]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:49.361 --> 03:52:57.624]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:57.624 --> 03:52:59.204]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:59.204 --> 03:53:00.405]  The people strike back.
[03:53:03.274 --> 03:53:05.135]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[03:53:05.135 --> 03:53:09.958]  You might not be able to spell Constitution, but you sure know how important it is.
[03:53:09.958 --> 03:53:16.101]  You might not be missing any shirts from your closet, but you have given the shirt off your back hundreds of times.
[03:53:16.101 --> 03:53:21.404]  You might not understand the thousands of laws that exist, but you do live by the Ten Commandments.
[03:53:21.404 --> 03:53:27.687]  You might not know who the bad guys are, or what you should be complaining about, but you do know what to be thankful for.
[03:53:27.687 --> 03:53:31.949]  You might not be looking for a government handout, but you do know how to lend a helping hand.
[03:53:34.231 --> 03:53:41.396]  There might be a lot that you don't know, but you do know that you want to take care of your family.
[03:53:41.396 --> 03:53:45.339]  You might not be able to own a farm, but you can have the food that came from one.
[03:53:45.339 --> 03:53:49.162]  We're thankful for the chance to lend a hand with food for you and your family.
[03:54:02.539 --> 03:54:10.105]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:54:10.105 --> 03:54:14.889]  I cannot stress enough for listeners, you better study history.
[03:54:14.889 --> 03:54:16.189]  I know a lot of you have.
[03:54:16.189 --> 03:54:17.531]  Some of you haven't.
[03:54:17.531 --> 03:54:19.492]  Tyranny is not fun.
[03:54:19.492 --> 03:54:21.373]  Being a slave is not fun.
[03:54:21.373 --> 03:54:28.319]  We've had it good so long, but we got seduced by evil and now we're already financially destroyed.
[03:54:28.319 --> 03:54:31.061]  I mean, this country's going into a depression any way you slice it.
[03:54:32.065 --> 03:54:33.145]  But we can come out of it.
[03:54:33.145 --> 03:54:35.946]  If you have liberty, you can regenerate everything very quickly.
[03:54:35.946 --> 03:54:39.168]  That's the engine of freedom and capital.
[03:54:39.168 --> 03:54:42.209]  You don't have that, nothing can bring it back.
[03:54:42.209 --> 03:54:48.351]  And so just know, as things get worse and worse, the solution is freedom and liberty, not big government, not tyranny, not control.
[03:54:48.351 --> 03:54:52.453]  Joe Bannister, freedomoffortune.com, that's what it comes down to.
[03:54:52.453 --> 03:54:55.194]  He that is willing to lay down his life will win his life, will gain it.
[03:54:56.107 --> 03:54:58.688]  He who is willing to lose his fortune will gain it.
[03:54:58.688 --> 03:55:00.448]  And it's not some magical thing, folks.
[03:55:00.448 --> 03:55:03.429]  It's if you're a coward and don't fight back, you're going to be a slave.
[03:55:03.429 --> 03:55:06.970]  But if you're willing to fight back, you're probably not going to be a slave.
[03:55:06.970 --> 03:55:11.351]  If you're willing to stand up for yourself and lose your fortune, you're the type that's probably going to win your fortune.
[03:55:11.351 --> 03:55:14.672]  A nation of sheep will be governed by a nation of wolves.
[03:55:14.672 --> 03:55:15.952]  And I said I'd take calls.
[03:55:15.952 --> 03:55:19.373]  We need to have Joe back up for a full hour in the near future.
[03:55:19.373 --> 03:55:21.093]  I apologize for getting him on late.
[03:55:21.093 --> 03:55:22.253]  There's just so much.
[03:55:22.253 --> 03:55:24.654]  Valerie in Alaska, you're on the air with Joe Bannister.
[03:55:26.517 --> 03:55:27.277]  Hi, how are you doing?
[03:55:27.277 --> 03:55:37.862]  I learned about this back in the 70s, what's going on today, when I was a teenager, and now my teenagers are learning about it and they're spreading the word at their school.
[03:55:37.862 --> 03:55:46.225]  My daughter's even writing a paper this week about the bird flu for her class, and she's going to share it with the whole class.
[03:55:46.225 --> 03:55:49.547]  That's going to be kind of eye-opening to a lot of the kids.
[03:55:50.877 --> 03:55:54.620]  Um, there was a few things I wanted to cover, but I know you don't probably have time.
[03:55:54.620 --> 03:55:57.802]  Um, there was a woman that came out here, uh, last week.
[03:55:57.802 --> 03:55:59.624]  Uh, she's in the Holocaust Museum.
[03:55:59.624 --> 03:56:09.091]  She works there, and she was in the Holocaust, and she said she'd be willing to do an interview with you sometime, so if you have time, you know, after this call, I'll give you her phone number.
[03:56:09.091 --> 03:56:19.078]  And I told her a little bit about the FEMA camp, and her eyes just, like, opened up, and you could see the fear came over her eyes, and I mean, she spent... Well, Glenn Beck says... She was a 10-year-old child, and she spent
[03:56:19.358 --> 03:56:26.921]  Two years in the forest by herself as a ten-year-old and not talking to anyone and that story is something else.
[03:56:26.921 --> 03:56:31.943]  Well it doesn't matter according to, it doesn't matter if congressmen admit they're building camps.
[03:56:31.943 --> 03:56:33.384]  According to Glenn Beck, everything's fine.
[03:56:33.384 --> 03:56:34.524]  But yes ma'am, give us that number.
[03:56:34.524 --> 03:56:35.725]  I appreciate your call.
[03:56:35.725 --> 03:56:38.346]  Joe, your comments on the FEMA camps.
[03:56:40.657 --> 03:56:48.962]  Well, I mean, I've reviewed the evidence that you've put out there on your website and talked about, and, you know, it looks convincing to me.
[03:56:48.962 --> 03:56:55.106]  I mean, it's certainly every bit as solid as anything I saw relating to the income tax.
[03:56:55.106 --> 03:57:07.334]  People need to, again, look at Alex Jones' conduct, look at what you've done all these years, and you refer to actual government documents, mainstream reports.
[03:57:08.400 --> 03:57:16.024]  Um, you know, the reason I was convinced was because of the people that made these claims pointed to real stuff.
[03:57:16.024 --> 03:57:20.147]  You know, not just some phony photocopy machine doctored up thing.
[03:57:20.147 --> 03:57:21.607]  Real evidence.
[03:57:21.607 --> 03:57:24.669]  Yeah, that's our biggest problem is that you have to expect this.
[03:57:24.669 --> 03:57:25.870]  Humanity's diverse.
[03:57:25.870 --> 03:57:31.613]  The media twists and spins and lies, but the alternative media, it's as varied as fish in the sea, you know?
[03:57:31.613 --> 03:57:33.574]  I mean, it's, there's a lot of crap out there.
[03:57:34.434 --> 03:57:48.240]  Yeah, but you know, with history, with the Nazis, I mean, certainly they had camps and all these kinds of things that we're seeing now is what they had before they went to, what, you know, imprisoning people, murdering people.
[03:57:48.240 --> 03:57:49.581]  I mean, these are the precursors.
[03:57:49.581 --> 03:57:51.082]  They have to do something with the bodies.
[03:57:51.082 --> 03:57:55.183]  They have to get people to go to these camps somehow.
[03:57:55.183 --> 03:57:56.724]  They have to fool people.
[03:57:56.724 --> 03:58:02.747]  I mean, we've seen it laid out, how it's done, and you're pointing out the similarities, and I hope people are waking up.
[03:58:04.622 --> 03:58:07.604]  Joe Bannister, FreedomAboveFortune.com.
[03:58:07.604 --> 03:58:10.185]  I really appreciate the fine work you and everybody else are doing.
[03:58:10.185 --> 03:58:13.207]  We'll talk to you again soon, and say hi to your family for me.
[03:58:13.207 --> 03:58:15.008]  Thanks to you and all your team, Alex.
[03:58:15.008 --> 03:58:15.409]  Thank you.
[03:58:15.409 --> 03:58:15.849]  Bye-bye.
[03:58:15.849 --> 03:58:16.229]  Thank you.
[03:58:16.229 --> 03:58:21.252]  Joe Bannister's a real gentleman, a really smart guy, and too nice, telling me how great I am all day.
[03:58:21.252 --> 03:58:22.153]  Folks, I'm not great.
[03:58:22.153 --> 03:58:23.814]  I don't even do the best job here.
[03:58:23.814 --> 03:58:26.496]  I just am trying to fight the new world order.
[03:58:26.496 --> 03:58:29.097]  I know if we stand up, we can beat these people.
[03:58:29.097 --> 03:58:30.158]  And that's what's so frustrating.
[03:58:31.075 --> 03:58:37.238]  Now, it's getting exciting as a lot of folks are waking up, but I'm still frustrated because I just can't stand the globalists and all the crimes they committed.
[03:58:37.238 --> 03:58:39.099]  A lot of important guests and information.
[03:58:39.099 --> 03:58:41.000]  Retransmission starts now at one place.
[03:58:41.000 --> 03:58:41.980]  Infowars.com.
[03:58:41.980 --> 03:58:44.622]  Spread the word about the show.
[03:58:44.622 --> 03:58:47.123]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:47.123 --> 03:58:49.424]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:52.230 --> 03:58:53.912]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:58:53.912 --> 03:58:58.658]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:58:58.658 --> 03:59:01.622]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:59:01.622 --> 03:59:04.666]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:59:04.666 --> 03:59:10.514]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[03:59:10.734 --> 03:59:13.978]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:59:13.978 --> 03:59:20.966]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:59:20.966 --> 03:59:24.249]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
