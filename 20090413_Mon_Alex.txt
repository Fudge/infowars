[00:00.000 --> 00:14.580]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.580 --> 00:36.240]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones I didn't do a Sunday show
[00:36.240 --> 00:44.940]  yesterday took it off for Ishtar Day with the family and it feels like I had a month
[00:44.940 --> 00:51.760]  off very very relaxing to actually have two full days off I didn't do any work Saturday
[00:51.760 --> 00:58.640]  or Sunday well that's not really true I only did four or five hours of research Saturday
[00:58.640 --> 01:03.900]  night and Sunday night but I don't really call that work so I am focused I have a ton
[01:03.900 --> 01:11.440]  of news and information to cover today very important broadcast just tons of just amazingly
[01:11.440 --> 01:21.680]  important news and information coming up in the next four hours we have now gotten a federal
[01:21.680 --> 01:28.200]  report this was going around the internet to Saturday night Kurt Nemo did a story on
[01:28.200 --> 01:36.300]  it at Infowars.com last night and I got home from my parents at about nine o'clock and
[01:36.300 --> 01:41.780]  I said you know why don't I just call the FBI phone number here and I did call and
[01:41.780 --> 01:48.500]  confirm that it is another MYAC report but it's a federal master report which is what
[01:48.500 --> 01:55.540]  the state reports are copied from and the headline is secret Department of Homeland
[01:55.540 --> 02:01.380]  Security document predicts violence in response to new gun restrictions it goes on to say
[02:01.380 --> 02:08.460]  that Americans buying guns and ammo are terrorist it says that this is the number one threat
[02:08.460 --> 02:14.220]  to law enforcement that it's terrorist they're buying the ammo and guns and then it's terrorism
[02:14.220 --> 02:21.540]  and that new gun restriction laws are going to cause a revolt in the country and so law
[02:21.540 --> 02:31.780]  enforcement is gearing up to deal with that so we're going to be covering that here on
[02:31.780 --> 02:40.820]  the show today also I noticed I was in the comment sections of Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com
[02:40.820 --> 02:46.620]  I saw an audio clip of another Genesis radio show and of course the regular accusations
[02:46.620 --> 02:52.060]  why are you covering this up Alex well because I didn't know about it that's why I was covering
[02:52.060 --> 02:58.380]  it up because I didn't know about it you posted it and let me know that I guess last week
[02:58.380 --> 03:03.060]  or something I just really had a caller to her show on the power hour from the mornings
[03:03.060 --> 03:08.380]  here in Genesis Network and the caller began hyperventilating and talking about trucks
[03:08.380 --> 03:13.380]  going into underground silos and being loaded with something iced up and how the guys are
[03:13.380 --> 03:20.340]  paid cash and they go to the back of Bank of America and I will tell you this folks it's
[03:20.340 --> 03:28.420]  no reflection on the fine radio show that this report is a load of bull I mean I will
[03:28.420 --> 03:33.940]  tell you that I mean I understand this stuff the minute I saw Linda Thompson's video of
[03:33.940 --> 03:42.820]  the train station 14 years ago in Illinois the Amtrak station it was baloney the minute
[03:42.820 --> 03:49.700]  I saw the colorized CS gas being sprayed out and they just painted it orange on the tank
[03:49.700 --> 03:56.780]  I said it was fake I told you that what Glenn Beck was going to be saying and doing in his
[03:56.780 --> 04:06.620]  hit piece look I know what I'm talking about okay and I'm telling you so I it's a big hysteria
[04:06.620 --> 04:16.460]  going on on the internet right now with this lady's phone call to a Genesis radio show
[04:16.460 --> 04:21.740]  the only way it's real is the feds are trying to create a freak out oh it doesn't even matter
[04:21.740 --> 04:28.940]  people won't listen to me it just doesn't matter it doesn't matter people like to chase a million
[04:28.940 --> 04:37.460]  vapers instead of the real meat and potatoes information so I'm going to break that down
[04:37.460 --> 04:44.820]  as well the what's really going on with the bird flu the weaponized bird flu that's coming
[04:44.820 --> 04:50.540]  up today as well it's just a totally jam packed transmission Naomi Wolf she's going to be

[05:07.700 --> 05:11.700]  for garden plants flowers and herbs it's called proto grow and it's so effective at producing
[05:11.700 --> 05:15.980]  rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically
[05:15.980 --> 05:19.740]  any soil and like conditions now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for
[05:19.740 --> 05:24.300]  self-reliance proto grows unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and
[05:24.300 --> 05:29.140]  dramatically increases bloom set creating maximum plant growth in minimum time proto grow works
[05:29.140 --> 05:32.660]  by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code
[05:32.660 --> 05:36.420]  for nutritional uptake in plants proto grows full spectrum plant fertility means fruits
[05:36.420 --> 05:40.340]  and vegetables with extraordinary taste enough to 10 times the nutritional value and if you
[05:40.340 --> 05:44.100]  want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass you can if you want to grow

[09:23.660 --> 09:29.660]  the assault weapons ban but obama's new version would actually register americans psychologically
[09:29.660 --> 09:39.180]  test americans and physically ban the the ownership of semi automatic handguns and rifles and
[09:39.180 --> 09:45.340]  here is a foreign government that has a total gun ban in their nation except for their police
[09:45.340 --> 09:50.580]  and military which has the highest crime rate of any country in the world where six thousand
[09:50.580 --> 09:55.540]  plus people died last year they're online for more than ten thousand to die this year
[09:55.540 --> 10:01.060]  if the trend continues thousands and thousands dead in the first few months of two thousand
[10:01.060 --> 10:07.780]  nine and here they are total gun ban for their citizens the criminals in government in uniform
[10:07.780 --> 10:13.780]  feed on the public i have been shaken down repeatedly by mexican police and troops i

[10:43.940 --> 10:48.780]  the thirty million illegal aliens and they may have introduced total amnesty bills again
[10:48.780 --> 10:51.820]  and they may think they've killed this country dead in the hammer but i'm telling you i'm
[10:51.820 --> 10:56.540]  not buying anything made in mexico and i'm never going back to mexico again let me just
[10:56.540 --> 11:03.980]  say that right now that criminal narco terrorist state government down there says we gotta turn
[11:03.980 --> 11:08.580]  our guns in and our attorney general runs around giving press conferences saying absolutely
[11:08.580 --> 11:15.820]  and now obama is set to go to mexico this week and call for amnesty open borders and
[11:15.820 --> 11:23.460]  banning our guns this is disgusting our government is so illegitimate so criminal it uses a country
[11:23.460 --> 11:27.980]  of a hundred million slaves with its criminal leaders as a weapon to beat this country in
[11:27.980 --> 11:36.540]  a submission we're a broke back country ladies and gentlemen so that's one of the things

[13:53.220 --> 14:02.540]  i listen to it and it's a caller to the genesis radio show and you know no blame on the fine
[14:02.540 --> 14:11.060]  talk show host and i just wish that caller called me so i could challenge him fact you're
[14:11.060 --> 14:18.260]  that lady from calling from new york freaking out one eight hundred two five nine nine two
[14:18.260 --> 14:22.140]  three one we don't have open phones right now but if you want to call in because i got some
[14:22.140 --> 14:32.020]  questions for you anyways this lady calls in and she says she says oh my gosh there's
[14:32.020 --> 14:36.980]  this truck driver he's spanish and he gets taken down on these silos and he gets given
[14:36.980 --> 14:42.980]  an injection he's told for the safety of his family and then it's all iced and it's taken
[14:42.980 --> 14:46.860]  and it's delivered and it goes all over the place to homeland security and here's the
[14:46.860 --> 14:51.260]  addresses of the and the and the health department and they tell him here's your number and he
[14:51.260 --> 14:55.860]  goes to a back room at bank of america and they pay him in cash it's all secret and you

[15:00.940 --> 15:11.580]  i consider and play it and analyze it and go over it but maybe i will point by point
[15:11.580 --> 15:25.580]  by point meanwhile look at these headlines homeless people die after bird flu vaccine
[15:25.580 --> 15:31.980]  trial in poland london telegraph here's french news agency health workers on trial for vaccine
[15:31.980 --> 15:36.740]  scam in poland they told over 200 patients that it was just a regular flu shot they gave
[15:36.740 --> 15:43.100]  it to them and 23 of them died and the big issue is the media won't say what pharmaceutical
[15:43.100 --> 15:48.220]  company paid the local homeless shelters to lie and give them a shot but it was live bird
[15:48.220 --> 15:53.780]  flu now that's your issue folks because that's where it will mutate in the body it's mixed
[15:53.780 --> 16:00.780]  in with a whole bunch of different strains of human flu and it's injected into the body
[16:00.780 --> 16:05.740]  that's how it mutates and creates an airborne super weaponized it's already weaponized bird
[16:05.740 --> 16:11.700]  flu but super weaponized see these are the articles nobody wants to make viral videos
[16:11.700 --> 16:17.700]  about this nobody wants to freak out about baxter pharmaceutical that was also involved
[16:17.700 --> 16:21.660]  shipping out with bear pharmaceutical the millions of ampoules of factor eight filled
[16:21.660 --> 16:30.100]  with hiv and hepatitis a bmc that admittedly killed hundreds of thousands and main in millions
[16:30.100 --> 16:36.060]  total got it and they're dying now i mean there you got absolutely confirmed shipping
[16:36.060 --> 16:46.500]  out hiv filled inoculations sexy of blood thickening drug platelet drug but it's made
[16:46.500 --> 16:54.180]  by mad vaccine maker no discussions of that no obsessions on that no hyperventilating
[16:54.180 --> 17:00.900]  you know you know why i'm successful in reaching people on this radio show my hyperventilating
[17:00.900 --> 17:04.580]  isn't the reason i'm successful my freak out is not the reason i'm successful no it's
[17:04.580 --> 17:13.180]  because we at least cover what can be proven you know i don't put up you know when they
[17:13.180 --> 17:17.700]  put up images a year and a half ago of fake america coins you could go look you could
[17:17.700 --> 17:22.620]  go see it was just a private little mint putting out some joke coins making fun of the north
[17:22.620 --> 17:27.420]  american union showing that it was tyrannical but people put it out that it was real north
[17:27.420 --> 17:32.500]  american union coins and so the national media can show that and say it's a hoax and say
[17:32.500 --> 17:38.780]  it in real meanwhile we got the spp documents and north american union and the cfr documents
[17:38.780 --> 17:44.020]  and press conferences with bush and buroso and the rest of them and merkel but nobody
[17:44.020 --> 17:56.500]  wants to focus on what's real instead it's on those stupid fake coins
[17:56.500 --> 17:58.940]  the government uh...
[17:58.940 --> 18:03.700]  we just have to be there shipping around in trucks a deadly bio weapon which is no proof
[18:03.700 --> 18:05.860]  of that person just saying that's what it is
[18:05.860 --> 18:09.620]  the if they're shipping that around
[18:09.620 --> 18:13.580]  they don't uh... call some regular trucker and tell them what it is and then say
[18:13.580 --> 18:18.380]  oh here's a shot and here's here's here's fifteen thousand or five thousand dollars
[18:18.380 --> 18:24.020]  a load and we we pay you in cash in the truck drivers running around showing the fbis is
[18:24.020 --> 18:28.620]  his hundred thousand dollars he's been paid in the last few weeks and uh... but the fed
[18:28.620 --> 18:35.260]  say it's okay and there is friend and he's been moved to a safe house i mean what the
[18:35.260 --> 18:41.100]  i mean it's just obvious total bull
[18:41.100 --> 18:49.300]  instead of baxter pharmaceutical knowingly shipping all of this stuff out
[18:49.300 --> 18:51.580]  shipping it out to countries
[18:51.580 --> 18:57.700]  there's all these bird flu vaccine trials people to drop in debt all over europe
[18:57.700 --> 19:00.260]  they won't say if it's a baxter or who it is
[19:00.260 --> 19:04.620]  these are companies with a history of knowingly shipping out millions of dosages of factor
[19:04.620 --> 19:06.100]  rate like bear
[19:06.100 --> 19:09.260]  working with baxter
[19:09.260 --> 19:13.740]  baxter is tied into the military national complex in black ops
[19:13.740 --> 19:15.060]  that's real
[19:15.060 --> 19:16.460]  london telegraph
[19:16.460 --> 19:18.380]  french news agency

[19:36.980 --> 19:41.980]  uh...
[19:41.980 --> 19:44.380]  because this is the type of craziness
[19:44.380 --> 19:47.460]  the discredits what we're doing now i can't blame people
[19:47.460 --> 19:49.060]  out there for believing it
[19:49.060 --> 19:51.340]  because we have a track record of a government
[19:51.340 --> 19:54.940]  that's been declassified thousands of times that takes a little foster children
[19:54.940 --> 19:57.100]  straps them down and radiates into death
[19:57.100 --> 20:02.260]  or injects them with nerve gas nerve nerve agent
[20:02.260 --> 20:06.260]  with our economy spiraling out of control living in the soup kitchens maybe
[20:06.260 --> 20:07.740]  right around the corner
[20:07.740 --> 20:12.020]  no one saw the financial collapse of nineteen twenty nine many didn't make it
[20:12.020 --> 20:16.940]  and millions ended up in soup lines becoming vagrants begging for food
[20:16.940 --> 20:21.260]  unlike nineteen twenty nine we can see this collapse coming we have been
[20:21.260 --> 20:25.460]  warned and right now we have a very small window of opportunity to get food
[20:25.460 --> 20:30.060]  storage into our homes before it's too late too late why is the canadian
[20:30.060 --> 20:34.100]  government telling their citizens to stock up why and why are soldiers calling
[20:34.100 --> 20:38.140]  home telling their families to get food storage supplies are running low

[24:16.660 --> 24:24.780]  you know last night I got home and saw Kurt posted an article just minutes
[24:24.780 --> 24:32.020]  before saying purported Homeland Security documents says gun owners are
[24:32.020 --> 24:36.620]  terrorists so I just went and read the document in about 20 minutes it's I
[24:36.620 --> 24:41.700]  don't know 10-15 pages long and I was sure it was real because I'd seen the
[24:41.700 --> 24:45.620]  exact same font the exact same paragraphs in other reports going back over
[24:45.620 --> 24:52.100]  the years I knew that you know the nomenclature the way it was written the
[24:52.100 --> 24:56.460]  latest info the control numbers matched other series of federal control numbers
[24:56.460 --> 25:02.020]  I'd seen on documents but I went ahead and tested the emails I went ahead and
[25:02.020 --> 25:10.580]  called the FBI phone number I went ahead and called the infrastructure
[25:10.580 --> 25:15.260]  protection fusion center numbers on it and talked to the watch captains and
[25:15.260 --> 25:19.340]  confirmed that it was their document they were very upset that I had it and
[25:19.340 --> 25:23.660]  we're asking me to tell them who gave it to me and I explained no this has been
[25:23.660 --> 25:31.460]  posted on the big libertarian sites it had just broken the last 12 hours and we
[25:31.460 --> 25:35.340]  learned of it with the classic tickets being sent to us saying why are you
[25:35.340 --> 25:39.860]  covering us up because we weren't aware of it please folks it's kind of it's a
[25:39.860 --> 25:43.260]  little insulting we're not I think people think I'm like Superman or something
[25:43.260 --> 25:48.460]  and I didn't like to see through walls you know I can but not even Superman was
[25:48.460 --> 25:53.660]  omnipresent and new all I'm not Dr. Manhattan either I guess even Dr.
[25:53.660 --> 26:00.780]  Manhattan you know it is it is not omnipresent but thank you for giving it
[26:00.780 --> 26:04.980]  to us nonetheless so we can cover it up like we're doing writing big articles
[26:04.980 --> 26:10.420]  about it right now I'm just it's not just you know I got a lot of serious news I
[26:10.420 --> 26:15.780]  can't digress it just sometimes it really amazes me so I call the FBI call
[26:15.780 --> 26:19.700]  the other phone numbers confirmed yes this is a federal report just like we
[26:19.700 --> 26:23.820]  called the Mayak office in Missouri and talked to them and they said yeah that's
[26:23.820 --> 26:27.420]  our report but we're not going to comment on it I've read them the two
[26:27.420 --> 26:31.060]  control numbers on it I gave them the phone numbers I read to them the last
[26:31.060 --> 26:34.500]  paragraph and he said where did you get that how did you get that tell me how
[26:34.500 --> 26:41.700]  you got that and it was one of the guys I talked to was a male sound like an
[26:41.700 --> 26:47.060]  African-American nice nice fellow and but very demanding that I get telling
[26:47.060 --> 26:53.460]  where it came from and other folks I call just wouldn't even talk to me they
[26:53.460 --> 26:56.460]  said I'm not gonna talk to him I can talk to you about it but this is the
[26:56.460 --> 27:01.060]  little tattletale squad phone number you can go up to info wars.com go to the
[27:01.060 --> 27:08.460]  end of the PDF document and you can call the phone numbers for yourself just
[27:08.460 --> 27:13.700]  like thousands of people did to the state of Missouri for two weeks still
[27:13.700 --> 27:17.940]  saying it was fake until the governor came out and defended it then backed
[27:17.940 --> 27:21.260]  off of it the lieutenant governor called people to resign some of the folks in
[27:21.260 --> 27:26.060]  state government did so my act report is real the worst one I've seen last few
[27:26.060 --> 27:31.540]  months is the 2009 Virginia terrorism threat assessment this is a hundred and
[27:31.540 --> 27:37.900]  fifty something pages long and list how they're watching everybody this one is
[27:37.900 --> 27:47.180]  the most restricted we've seen yet and a lot of cryptic stuff in this new one
[27:47.180 --> 27:51.700]  right-wing extremism current economic and political climate fueling
[27:51.700 --> 27:57.300]  resurgence and radicalization and recruitment and this one explains that
[27:57.300 --> 28:01.900]  it's basically just the redacted head paragraphs it tells police the and
[28:01.900 --> 28:06.180]  military of course if you want full names our investigations how we spy on
[28:06.180 --> 28:11.340]  Americans it says that in the last page just call us and we'll give it to you so
[28:11.340 --> 28:16.660]  it is a nightmarish to say the least and Paul Watson's on a report so has hurt
[28:16.660 --> 28:21.580]  him out of the first report last night we altered the report that has expanded
[28:21.580 --> 28:27.100]  it last night once I confirmed it was real I told Kurt I said this is
[28:27.100 --> 28:30.380]  definitely real and he said yeah it looks like it's real to me but I'm gonna
[28:30.380 --> 28:33.700]  say we don't know that I said let me just call the phone numbers so that went
[28:33.700 --> 28:43.220]  on for about an hour and no it's as real as a gold piece so you put it in the
[28:43.220 --> 28:51.060]  bank as real as a $10 gold piece so just it's it's amazing gun owners are
[28:51.060 --> 28:54.900]  terrorist you're out buying guns and ammo you are a dangerous terrorist you're
[28:54.900 --> 29:00.060]  the number one threat and number one concerned law enforcement right now and
[29:00.060 --> 29:04.220]  that they're gonna they're they're trying to pass gun restrictions and gun
[29:04.220 --> 29:08.140]  bans and that they believe you're a terrorist and that you're gonna resist
[29:08.140 --> 29:12.860]  them so they basically say yes we're trying to pass gun restriction laws they
[29:12.860 --> 29:17.460]  say the Supreme Court ruling allows us to restrict guns you gotta love their
[29:17.460 --> 29:21.780]  double-speak in there they say that we're delusional that there is no problem
[29:21.780 --> 29:25.340]  with the economy they actually say it's our perception that we're making it up
[29:25.340 --> 29:31.740]  that it's our propaganda the economy's fine I mean you want to go read 1984
[29:31.740 --> 29:36.300]  propaganda you want to go read the mental illness of what the feds feed
[29:36.300 --> 29:42.900]  local police the denial of course we have this because police did leak it we've
[29:42.900 --> 29:46.660]  confirmed that with the original site to put it out
[29:46.660 --> 29:59.980]  we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[30:05.100 --> 30:09.780]  times are tough right now and people are unsure about our future the economy is
[30:09.780 --> 30:13.060]  hurting even though there are powers that would make us believe differently
[30:13.060 --> 30:17.660]  banks are failing and the gold buyers are buying question with all the

[31:10.100 --> 31:15.020]  kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see the Obama deception
[31:15.020 --> 31:19.140]  completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the
[31:19.140 --> 31:23.980]  American people while Obama's already fudging yeah but since day one in this
[31:23.980 --> 31:28.220]  election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality

[33:22.060 --> 33:30.100]  last hour of the show today we got former Treasury agent criminal investigator Joe
[33:30.100 --> 33:34.340]  Bannister joining us you found out the IRS was a private collection agency for
[33:34.340 --> 33:38.660]  the offshore Federal Reserve that's what you're right your checks to is the
[33:38.660 --> 33:44.180]  Federal Reserve and now we're gonna be paying global carbon taxes directly into
[33:44.180 --> 33:49.820]  private banks and it's openly being announced well I tell you it's just
[33:49.820 --> 33:53.020]  getting crazier and crazier Naomi Wolf coming up in an hour and a half look I'm
[33:53.020 --> 33:56.500]  gonna open the phones up coming up here in just a few minutes that we'll do it
[33:56.500 --> 34:08.660]  right now 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 but coming up about 1015 minutes into
[34:08.660 --> 34:14.060]  the next hour after take some calls I'm going to do a detailed analysis of the
[34:14.060 --> 34:18.460]  most horrific report we've seen yet now I said the one last week that came out
[34:18.460 --> 34:23.300]  the 2009 Virginia terrorism threat assessment overall is the worst because
[34:23.300 --> 34:26.980]  it's the most detailed report it's a hundred fifty something pages we've
[34:26.980 --> 34:32.020]  covered that but but but when it comes to the second amendment the most
[34:32.020 --> 34:37.300]  frightening the most out of control is this a secret for official use only
[34:37.300 --> 34:41.620]  Department of Homeland Security document put out April 7th so put out last week
[34:41.620 --> 34:47.500]  and I have confirmed its authenticity and it says American gun owners are
[34:47.500 --> 35:01.340]  terrorists period so this is just off the charts hard core so that is coming up
[35:01.340 --> 35:13.140]  and then I'm gonna play the clip from Joyce Riley's radio show here on Genesis
[35:13.140 --> 35:19.380]  and I want to be clear about this I've known Joyce since like 1995 she's a
[35:19.380 --> 35:28.460]  great lady really hard-working very talented so is Dave and I'm not
[35:28.460 --> 35:31.900]  criticizing them for having a caller into their show I mean I have callers
[35:31.900 --> 35:36.180]  that call in and you know say they have microchips in their brains and that I
[35:36.180 --> 35:41.100]  put the microchips there so it's no reflection on on on Joyce talking to
[35:41.100 --> 35:45.020]  this lady it's just that I've been probably sent 500 emails on this I was
[35:45.020 --> 35:49.900]  sent one it's probably more than 500 it's just everywhere enough respect who's
[35:49.900 --> 35:53.540]  one of my favorite directors on YouTube has picked it up in a chat I don't know
[35:53.540 --> 36:00.460]  like 30,000 views just the last few hours and this is the kind of stuff
[36:00.460 --> 36:03.820]  they're gonna end up putting on Glenn Beck and discrediting us with and I'm
[36:03.820 --> 36:08.140]  not bashing anybody for picking this up and looking at it I don't blame anybody
[36:08.140 --> 36:13.420]  for not trusting the government I mean they admittedly tens of thousands of
[36:13.420 --> 36:18.340]  times have been caught testing chemical biological radiological only American
[36:18.340 --> 36:23.620]  people so we have to take all of this stuff seriously it's just that listen to
[36:23.620 --> 36:29.020]  this tape I know without a shadow of a doubt it's absolute bull I know because
[36:29.020 --> 36:34.500]  I study this and I wrote notes on it last night and then the notes just don't do
[36:34.500 --> 36:37.740]  it justice I'm gonna have to play it piece by piece and and comment on it
[36:37.740 --> 36:43.980]  because because it isn't just this lady hyperventilating and freaking out and I
[36:43.980 --> 36:46.700]  have no doubt that she didn't talk to some schizophrenic truck driver who
[36:46.700 --> 36:50.980]  really believes this I've just learned what's bull and what isn't and I really
[36:50.980 --> 36:56.060]  have never been wrong I've only been wrong in the past because I didn't follow
[36:56.060 --> 37:02.940]  my instincts but there's a lot of reasons and I'll explain that meanwhile
[37:02.940 --> 37:10.460]  meanwhile the real bird flu situation is off the charts people are dying they're
[37:10.460 --> 37:15.660]  being given experimental live bird flu shots it mutates in the body you could
[37:15.660 --> 37:19.260]  go airborne anytime there is definitely something going on with this and
[37:19.260 --> 37:24.460]  that's why it's so suspected right at the time we have all this serious news we
[37:24.460 --> 37:28.860]  have this type of hysteria going on but see again what do you expect when the
[37:28.860 --> 37:35.220]  people learn just how criminal the government is so that is coming up
[37:35.220 --> 37:42.660]  after I get into this new report again ladies and gentlemen American gun owners
[37:42.660 --> 37:47.020]  buying guns buying ammo you are a terrorist you are the number one threat
[37:47.020 --> 37:55.420]  to the federal government police that's what document number 1a-0257-09
[37:55.420 --> 38:02.740]  says 1a-0257-09 and you can call the FBI up right now and they'll tell you it's
[38:02.740 --> 38:07.020]  their document and we need the media to call them up and have them confirm it
[38:07.020 --> 38:10.420]  because when I tell you it's confirmed people will deny it all day till the AP
[38:10.420 --> 38:16.940]  a week from now goes oh yeah they told us it's real so I don't get 500 more
[38:16.940 --> 38:20.540]  emails saying I made this up or that I wrote this just like I did with my act
[38:20.540 --> 38:25.940]  in the 2009 Virginia terrorism threat assessment which they confirm is real
[38:25.940 --> 38:29.900]  and everything else or the civilian inmate labor camp programmer when I
[38:29.900 --> 38:35.260]  posted a month ago that's the key to info wars dot com and prison planet dot
[38:35.260 --> 38:38.900]  com they are the biggest thing out there the biggest game in town it comes
[38:38.900 --> 38:45.100]  alternative media and so this didn't break when it was in Bloomberg and
[38:45.100 --> 38:51.580]  Toronto Star and Czechoslovakia newspapers Czech Republic newspapers it
[38:51.580 --> 38:57.060]  broke and became a big sensation when we link to the mainstream articles and
[38:57.060 --> 39:01.780]  wrote an article about and that's the incredible responsibility we have here
[39:01.780 --> 39:07.100]  this has been out for a few days this federal document but a nobody thought to
[39:07.100 --> 39:10.460]  call the feds to confirm if it was real or not they just said oh look we this has
[39:10.460 --> 39:16.900]  been released by a law enforcement source so we also do little basic
[39:16.900 --> 39:19.980]  journalism things like that and I don't claim to be the cat's meow of
[39:19.980 --> 39:23.300]  journalism either I don't have the time or energy I mean I'm like a cook who's
[39:23.300 --> 39:27.140]  got a hundred dishes you know out here on the stove and I'm trying to do that
[39:27.140 --> 39:31.580]  while I wash dishes and while I clean tables while I bus tables but I mean the
[39:31.580 --> 39:35.540]  amount of documents we get in troops running checkpoints and we had the
[39:35.540 --> 39:40.940]  Federal Reserve security guards run up off Federal Reserve property and threaten
[39:40.940 --> 39:44.860]  to arrest Aaron Dykes and Rob Jacobson in Kansas City, Missouri they're just
[39:44.860 --> 39:46.820]  driving down the road from doing an interview and they go look there's a
[39:46.820 --> 39:50.260]  Federal Reserve branch let's video tape it they're on a park across the street
[39:50.260 --> 39:54.980]  150 yards away that but they run over and say we're gonna arrest you if you
[39:54.980 --> 39:58.860]  don't tell us your names and then they one of them tells them their names which
[39:58.860 --> 40:01.900]  I wouldn't have done but fine and then they say okay we're still gonna arrest
[40:01.900 --> 40:05.100]  you if you don't leave don't point your cameras at us and you know that happened
[40:05.100 --> 40:10.740]  to DC Federal Reserve to you know to a major news reporter that footage is
[40:10.740 --> 40:14.260]  after these people come off their own property it's not even federal and they
[40:14.260 --> 40:17.580]  just say I don't have to tell you a lot I'm gonna arrest you don't aim your
[40:17.580 --> 40:22.900]  camera at our building there's no First Amendment but meanwhile they cower and
[40:22.900 --> 40:26.660]  hide inside when we have hundreds of protesters at all 38 of their criminal
[40:26.660 --> 40:31.220]  locations and then it turns out they have the Army spying on us saying we're
[40:31.220 --> 40:35.460]  terrorists when I was in Dallas with Ron Paul's brother and they had the Army
[40:35.460 --> 40:39.780]  spying on Ron Paul in Houston across the street of the park you know they think
[40:39.780 --> 40:44.740]  it's illegal and by the way this new federal document right-wing extremism
[40:44.740 --> 40:48.740]  current economic and political climate fueling reassurgents and radicalization
[40:48.740 --> 41:02.100]  recruitment this thing is just an amazing document and calls the American
[41:02.100 --> 41:07.020]  people terrorist and says that if you talk about the economy following a
[41:07.020 --> 41:11.140]  partner basically a terrorist so I'm gonna be going over that like I said it's
[41:11.140 --> 41:18.720]  just just unbelievable I got a bunch of notes on that the stories need to go
[41:18.720 --> 41:23.340]  mega viral Paul Watson's secret Homeland Security threat assessment labels gun
[41:23.340 --> 41:27.300]  owners potential terrorist I didn't even say potential it says the terrorist are
[41:27.300 --> 41:33.140]  buying guns and ammo curtain ammo to another fine report now here's some of
[41:33.140 --> 41:37.900]  the other bombshell news and I mean bombshell China's slows purchases of
[41:37.900 --> 41:43.740]  US and other bonds so China the biggest owner of debt worldwide formerly it was
[41:43.740 --> 41:47.660]  Japan they're still number two and in the Arabs number three they are moving
[41:47.660 --> 41:53.740]  away from currencies period because they're inflating them all that's the
[41:53.740 --> 42:01.020]  New York Times Attenborough warns on population the broadcaster Sir David
[42:01.020 --> 42:05.020]  Attenborough has become a patron of a group seeking to cut the growth of human
[42:05.020 --> 42:08.540]  population yeah I had the optimum population trust on the Prince Philip's
[42:08.540 --> 42:12.500]  a part of a few years ago remember he said it was basically a crime that I had
[42:12.500 --> 42:16.380]  two children I said that's it I'm gonna have another one I did went home and my
[42:16.380 --> 42:22.820]  wife was pregnant within a week it says a Sir David has been increasingly vocal
[42:22.820 --> 42:28.620]  about the need to reduce the number of people on earth to protect wildlife now
[42:28.620 --> 42:32.160]  yes no so you can just be a control freak and dehumanize people he's a
[42:32.160 --> 42:38.180]  eugenicist folks and here's another one UK population must fall to 30 million
[42:38.180 --> 42:43.500]  that's the government they want to reduce the number by half
[42:43.500 --> 42:52.420]  turns out that the police had a corrupt pathologist lie and say that this guy
[42:52.420 --> 42:55.540]  died of a heart attack when it wasn't true that's London Guardian they just
[42:55.540 --> 42:58.940]  beat a guy delivering newspapers to death and then they just said we had a
[42:58.940 --> 43:02.100]  heart attack didn't matter the cops all videotaped the murder that they
[43:02.100 --> 43:05.540]  committed and now it's coming out that they did this and then that this
[43:05.540 --> 43:09.660]  pathologist specializes in covering things up for the police well yeah it's
[43:09.660 --> 43:16.020]  like fami Malik over in Arkansas where you'd have people shoot themselves
[43:16.020 --> 43:19.780]  twice in the back of the head with a shotgun there were cases where people's
[43:19.780 --> 43:23.460]  arms and legs were chopped off they were putting plastic bags of gasoline poured
[43:23.460 --> 43:27.100]  on them they'd be found in trash dumps their dead bodies cut up and he would
[43:27.100 --> 43:31.780]  rule it suicide they killed a bunch of cops at expose what was happening they
[43:31.780 --> 43:36.260]  had a machine gun them off the road and say it was suicide
[43:36.260 --> 43:40.340]  because you know they were openly running cocaine in there and he was a
[43:40.340 --> 43:43.780]  local medical examiner that covered up the dead kids on the train tracks the
[43:43.780 --> 43:48.500]  rest of it so Clinton made him a state medical examiner you know that the
[43:48.500 --> 43:53.500]  government's so disgusting that's like dr. David Kelly former head of bio
[43:53.500 --> 43:57.700]  weapons development important down he blew the whistle about WMD's not being
[43:57.700 --> 44:03.780]  in Iraq he sent a email out to more than 10 colleagues including newspapers
[44:03.780 --> 44:06.540]  saying well I've been told I'm gonna be found dead in the woods for what I've
[44:06.540 --> 44:12.220]  done I just want to say bye to everybody then if they kill me and then the
[44:12.220 --> 44:17.220]  police come up and five guys in black uniforms in the early morning dawn at a
[44:17.220 --> 44:22.860]  local park run away from his body the police come up he has slit wrist but no
[44:22.860 --> 44:27.780]  blood meaning they were slit after he's dead and three undigested pills in his
[44:27.780 --> 44:32.460]  stomach and they said that he slit his wrist and took pills I mean folks I
[44:32.460 --> 44:36.420]  could be murdered and you could see the men in black uniforms the literal
[44:36.420 --> 44:40.420]  ringwraiths could be on me and run away jumping my body and they would say oh
[44:40.420 --> 44:47.100]  Alex killed himself I mean that's how corrupt these medical examiners are that's
[44:47.100 --> 44:50.980]  like cop of the year Terrence Yakey sables people in OKC saw the BATF
[44:50.980 --> 44:56.060]  involved in the bombing he was driving by when it happened he he was called his
[44:56.060 --> 44:58.980]  partner and said hey I went to the storage said to get out the evidence I'm
[44:58.980 --> 45:02.660]  getting followed by FBI they pull him over torture him for hours in a field
[45:02.660 --> 45:08.460]  shoot him in the back of the head torture him all over his body I mean
[45:08.460 --> 45:18.780]  that's who your government is ladies and gentlemen so I've got that report I've
[45:18.780 --> 45:22.300]  seen five different reports in the last week of people murdering people with
[45:22.300 --> 45:26.140]  cars I just said we should ban cars and we should write articles about what
[45:26.140 --> 45:28.860]  these people that kill people with cars are reading they're reading the sports
[45:28.860 --> 45:32.060]  illustrated sports illustrated it's causing the murders I mean that's the
[45:32.060 --> 45:36.260]  measure that I'm being blamed for with the cop killer who hated me but that
[45:36.260 --> 45:43.740]  doesn't matter by the way that's in the new federal report black voters waiver
[45:43.740 --> 45:51.660]  on support for Patterson than the New York governor that replaced the one they
[45:51.660 --> 45:56.300]  set up and he's saying oh it's cuz white people don't like him you know I mean
[45:56.300 --> 46:01.460]  this is you're really getting old folks no no one likes you cuz you just passed
[46:01.460 --> 46:12.260]  80 plus taxes so that's some of what's going on former Obama advisor CFR VP
[46:12.260 --> 46:18.460]  says 100,000 troops 10 more years needed in Afghanistan now now here's the
[46:18.460 --> 46:27.260]  really big news also on the economy GM told to prep for bankruptcy filing
[46:27.260 --> 46:31.700]  report the federal government files the last executive and then tells GM what to
[46:31.700 --> 46:37.660]  do and how to file bankruptcy and how to be handed over to Obama's cronies just
[46:37.660 --> 46:40.700]  like the IMF and World Bank come in and bankrupt herbal companies by design and
[46:40.700 --> 46:45.860]  then tell them we'll give you more fiat loans backed up by US taxpayers you just
[46:45.860 --> 46:54.220]  got to do what we say and that is take the money we give you and then invest
[46:54.220 --> 46:59.540]  that with our own private corporation see the private banks take our money give
[46:59.540 --> 47:03.340]  it to the third world and then have the third world by agreements they sign
[47:03.340 --> 47:07.500]  invested in globalist corporations in those nations and then they have tax
[47:07.500 --> 47:11.220]  incentives in the US and Europe and Australia and New Zealand to then ship
[47:11.220 --> 47:17.220]  our jobs offshore to the IMF and World Bank finance factories so your tax money
[47:17.220 --> 47:21.340]  pays to build the factories the people in the third world nations get slave
[47:21.340 --> 47:30.020]  wages and again there's tax incentives to move the corporations there but that's
[47:30.020 --> 47:33.540]  the club of roman you and you and others brag that is to actually destroy
[47:33.540 --> 47:38.100]  industry and destroy the west so there's no markets as the fiat economy the
[47:38.100 --> 47:42.100]  banking economy wages war against the real economy and tries to create a
[47:42.100 --> 47:47.180]  quote post industrial world you understand what they're setting up here
[47:47.180 --> 47:51.660]  where they'll be highly controlled government and private corporate
[47:51.660 --> 47:55.540]  reservations it'll be high technology zones that will be technological there
[47:55.540 --> 48:00.540]  already are our technological spheres that are on pedestals protected under
[48:00.540 --> 48:08.260]  the shroud of national security outside will be the highly controlled compact
[48:08.260 --> 48:16.820]  city slave grids and in the rich living in the private manners and plantation
[48:16.820 --> 48:21.180]  type situations outside the mega cities and this is all stated by them you want
[48:21.180 --> 48:25.020]  to people keep saying oh Alex you know they totally had a world government new
[48:25.020 --> 48:27.660]  world order this would have already happened and you would be on air that's
[48:27.660 --> 48:31.300]  right they don't have it yet they're very close to completing it they got their
[48:31.300 --> 48:35.660]  world bank world army world regulations they bankrupted all the nations by
[48:35.660 --> 48:39.220]  designs or fiat currency they're openly setting up world government now with

[1:00:30.380 --> 1:00:33.300]  we're the only hope of stopping the offshore private banks from taking over
[1:00:33.300 --> 1:00:36.660]  we're the people that expose that they would bankrupt the economy using
[1:00:36.660 --> 1:00:40.060]  derivatives announced a new bank of the world announced a new global currency

[1:00:49.220 --> 1:00:53.180]  openly taking over with the 912 movement the Tea Party's happening all over the
[1:00:53.180 --> 1:00:56.900]  country and they tell their members you will not and I confirmed that we're

[1:01:20.260 --> 1:01:25.060]  me and and and all of this stuff I mean you know this is what America is
[1:01:25.060 --> 1:01:32.780]  teaching you how to be a bunch of in fact in the new FEMA report put out by

[1:01:37.900 --> 1:01:42.340]  free speeches allowed but we may have to restrict free speech in America it says
[1:01:42.340 --> 1:01:46.060]  you know people protesting illegal aliens might be covered by the First
[1:01:46.060 --> 1:01:50.260]  Amendment but not in all cases if we think it might lead to violence and
[1:01:50.260 --> 1:01:53.940]  that's why the feds say oh you can only be in a free speech zone behind you know
[1:01:53.940 --> 1:01:57.900]  two miles from here because there might be a fight with you and other protesters
[1:01:57.900 --> 1:02:07.260]  say I mean can you imagine Glenn Beck that ninny I mean he's a ninny he sits up
[1:02:07.260 --> 1:02:11.660]  there and ninnies and does all these effeminate gestures and I mean I feel

[1:02:56.660 --> 1:03:02.420]  other groups by sending people they say they're going no orders from headquarters
[1:03:02.420 --> 1:03:06.140]  here down there to give them Obama deceptions and other things Obama's
[1:03:06.140 --> 1:03:12.380]  going to the big university in Phoenix Arizona State University and they're
[1:03:12.380 --> 1:03:16.940]  close to making 10,000 copies of that to hand it out I mean the establishments
[1:03:16.940 --> 1:03:20.340]  upset and look I'm sorry we're going to stand up to you in the bankers you know
[1:03:20.340 --> 1:03:25.460]  the private Federal Reserve admittedly has sent out tens of thousands of bank
[1:03:25.460 --> 1:03:28.740]  workers to be paid to go to universities high schools you name it and
[1:03:28.740 --> 1:03:32.100]  brainwash people about how great the Federal Reserve was when I was protesting
[1:03:32.100 --> 1:03:36.740]  the Federal Reserve last year in Dallas on in the Fed Day number 22nd while we
[1:03:36.740 --> 1:03:39.820]  were outside being watched by the army and being called terrorists and army
[1:03:39.820 --> 1:03:44.180]  documents we later got they had hundreds of high school teachers and
[1:03:44.180 --> 1:03:48.340]  professors in there being paid being taught a weekend course how to go out and
[1:03:48.340 --> 1:03:52.020]  brainwash people that how great the new global currency is and how great the
[1:03:52.020 --> 1:03:55.580]  Federal Reserve is because these criminals are destroying America and they
[1:03:55.580 --> 1:04:00.660]  know they've got to be politically active and suppress us exposing them and
[1:04:00.660 --> 1:04:04.900]  so that's all this is they're trying to take over our tea party movement and
[1:04:04.900 --> 1:04:08.980]  it's gonna work so everybody go to Glenn Beck stinking tea party movement have
[1:04:08.980 --> 1:04:12.140]  whatever sign you want they're not gonna be able to have the cops stop everybody

[1:04:42.500 --> 1:04:46.140]  can and can't say imagine they told Colonel William Travis what he couldn't
[1:04:46.140 --> 1:04:52.060]  couldn't say he'd say shut up tyrant I mean you know this this is this is where

[1:08:15.780 --> 1:08:20.500]  San Antonio called in by the way we just started summer casting at prison
[1:08:20.500 --> 1:08:25.980]  planet dot tv but that's a San Antonio tea party website backup they've been
[1:08:25.980 --> 1:08:29.340]  going to these meetings you know it's Ron Paul groups that started the tea
[1:08:29.340 --> 1:08:36.460]  parties it's Gary Franchi and others that started the in the Fed protest you
[1:08:36.460 --> 1:08:39.420]  know it's our movement against the private bankers that are looting and
[1:08:39.420 --> 1:08:43.380]  raping us which is very popular right now the people know it's the truth we're
[1:08:43.380 --> 1:08:48.980]  of the good guys well they say hey you don't bring signs you know they have the
[1:08:48.980 --> 1:08:52.260]  acceptable ones they're on the top of prison planet dot tv viewers but scroll
[1:08:52.260 --> 1:08:56.420]  down under there oh it's borderline to have an image of the founding fathers
[1:08:56.420 --> 1:09:01.220]  dumping tea in the harbor founding fathers we don't know that's allowed the
[1:09:01.220 --> 1:09:07.020]  sign of hope change with the image of the Statue of Liberty in trouble now can't
[1:09:07.020 --> 1:09:12.140]  have that can't say obama nism with a hammer and sickle around his rising
[1:09:12.140 --> 1:09:19.380]  son and you can't have one that says obama lied you can't have one that says
[1:09:19.380 --> 1:09:23.700]  impeach obama I mean no free speech so I guess the tea party is an anti free
[1:09:23.700 --> 1:09:28.900]  speech meeting I mean I guess it's like when you take your dog to have him
[1:09:28.900 --> 1:09:34.420]  neutered my I guess you could you mean it's legal and lawful for men if you
[1:09:34.420 --> 1:09:37.100]  want to go be castrated you could just go to the doctor and pay to have it done
[1:09:37.100 --> 1:09:40.900]  is that having when back to it for you I mean that's what Glenn back does is he
[1:09:40.900 --> 1:09:44.780]  poses and he's radical and he's gonna expose the FEMA caption he's gonna
[1:09:44.780 --> 1:09:49.140]  expose this and oh they don't exist it's cooks he uses a straw man argument
[1:09:49.140 --> 1:09:52.420]  goes after what I predicted he would the few fake stories that are out there and
[1:09:52.420 --> 1:09:56.420]  oh Ron Paul supporters are terrorists and the army needs to be used against him
[1:09:56.420 --> 1:10:00.020]  and they're with McVeigh right out of these government reports I mean that's
[1:10:00.020 --> 1:10:04.540]  all I do is read these federal reports that get leaked to us and others and I
[1:10:04.540 --> 1:10:08.100]  saw Glenn back years ago going off talking points out of federal documents I
[1:10:08.100 --> 1:10:13.460]  mean you know I know the guys in operative and and and that's what they're
[1:10:13.460 --> 1:10:17.100]  doing and again I don't make this show about attacking other talk show host
[1:10:17.100 --> 1:10:22.340]  even people I can't stand you know Diane Feinstein let's get that clip ready the
[1:10:22.340 --> 1:10:27.100]  video clip she came out in 60 minutes and said you know what last weekend we
[1:10:27.100 --> 1:10:30.140]  are gonna reintroduce assault weapons ban when the times right and by the way
[1:10:30.140 --> 1:10:34.900]  it's an expanded assault weapons ban to actually ban them physically and make you
[1:10:34.900 --> 1:10:38.580]  be federally registered to shut down gun shows they're gonna tag all this on
[1:10:38.580 --> 1:10:43.260]  that they have done it and then now last night on 60 minutes they have the
[1:10:43.260 --> 1:10:49.380]  Mexican ambassadors saying oh we need to ban your guns in America because that's
[1:10:49.380 --> 1:10:53.020]  what's causing the problem in Mexico not drug prohibition that makes the drug
[1:10:53.020 --> 1:10:56.580]  gangs make so much money it's not it's not the drug war that's caused all this
[1:10:56.580 --> 1:11:00.220]  increase the drugs increase the profits all of it everybody knows that's what
[1:11:00.220 --> 1:11:05.100]  they did it just like prohibition of alcohol did that 80 years ago and it's
[1:11:05.100 --> 1:11:09.940]  not that Mexico has a total gun ban for citizens you know that's why Chicago is
[1:11:09.940 --> 1:11:13.740]  so bad or New York so bad and then they always use those as a as examples of why
[1:11:13.740 --> 1:11:17.260]  I need to turn my guns in in Texas because where they've got control where
[1:11:17.260 --> 1:11:20.420]  the big city crime machines have control they disarmed everybody so it's a
[1:11:20.420 --> 1:11:24.900]  hellhole and they're obsessed with blaming it on us now I said I was gonna go
[1:11:24.900 --> 1:11:29.140]  calls I got a lot of clips coming up I gotta get to two but Matthew we are
[1:11:29.140 --> 1:11:33.820]  changed who alerted us to this last hour we did confirm it's accurate they're
[1:11:33.820 --> 1:11:37.820]  saying you know no Alex Jones allowed no you know we don't want Alex Jones
[1:11:37.820 --> 1:11:41.740]  there hey look I don't want to be around you either it's not fun to go down and
[1:11:41.740 --> 1:11:47.700]  confront Lynn Beck and actually look at a Benedict Arnold I mean he it hurts my
[1:11:47.700 --> 1:11:53.500]  spirit to see his folks I would tell you I've exposed Janet Reno and gone up
[1:11:53.500 --> 1:11:57.260]  against her I've been arrested for asking Bush a question you know there are a
[1:11:57.260 --> 1:12:00.980]  few people that actually put off an aura as evil as going back it's not just all
[1:12:00.980 --> 1:12:04.500]  the evidence I have I mean it's my guts I go I mean it's like a dog knows when
[1:12:04.500 --> 1:12:10.220]  somebody's bad I'm like and the hair is going up I mean this this is bad this
[1:12:10.220 --> 1:12:15.820]  guy is BAD this is a treacherous Larson as trader who wants to steal your
[1:12:15.820 --> 1:12:25.700]  freedoms so they're here to co-opt our movement suddenly Fox News is worried
[1:12:25.700 --> 1:12:28.860]  about the New World Order after all these years saying it doesn't exist and
[1:12:28.860 --> 1:12:35.060]  then they're begging for $35,000 on here and so what you do is I guess you give
[1:12:35.060 --> 1:12:39.500]  them thousands of dollars and they tell you be a good citizen be polite don't
[1:12:39.500 --> 1:12:49.940]  call for Obama's impeachment it's just disgusting no talking down everyone
[1:12:49.940 --> 1:12:53.020]  like like it's this is like I remember in first grade when we go to zoo in
[1:12:53.020 --> 1:12:56.860]  Dallas and for weeks before they would go and you will hold hands when you go
[1:12:56.860 --> 1:13:06.100]  to the bathroom and you will not raise your voice and you will tie your shoe
[1:13:06.100 --> 1:13:18.860]  laces because we're we're following the mini Patriot leader I mean I can't even
[1:13:18.860 --> 1:13:28.060]  do it you know it's looking I'm going back I'm your Patriot leader I mean I
[1:13:28.060 --> 1:13:31.860]  can't even do it man I can't even do it the guy is and it's not just that he's
[1:13:31.860 --> 1:13:37.100]  a feminine he's he's that a feminine nanny backstabber you're the real fake
[1:13:37.100 --> 1:13:41.700]  oh I care about you when he does it it's so fake it's all about how he's getting
[1:13:41.700 --> 1:13:45.620]  it over on you I promise I would have exposed the camps if they'd have been
[1:13:45.620 --> 1:13:50.860]  real but they're not and these Patriot types are McVeigh people I'm worried
[1:13:50.860 --> 1:13:56.420]  about them next up when you do attack Iran stay with me I'll be right back I
[1:13:56.420 --> 1:14:05.780]  mean I can't even do it and I'm sorry I'm tired of him I can't look at him
[1:14:05.780 --> 1:14:11.260]  anymore all right I'm gonna shut up let's go back to a Matthew in Texas so you
[1:14:11.260 --> 1:14:14.020]  dare to say you're gonna bring the Obama deception you know what's gonna
[1:14:14.020 --> 1:14:19.220]  happen the police on city property or try to say in America you can't hand the
[1:14:19.220 --> 1:14:23.780]  free videos out where the veterans fought so you'd have no freedom Travis died
[1:14:23.780 --> 1:14:28.740]  in the Valimo right there so you'd have freedom to shut up so there needs to be
[1:14:28.740 --> 1:14:32.260]  a bunch of you down there and catch it all on videotape how they try to
[1:14:32.260 --> 1:14:35.740]  destroy freedom in America and this will only blow up bigger in their face
[1:14:35.740 --> 1:14:39.540]  the coward Beck has already said he's not gonna go on stage because I've seen
[1:14:39.540 --> 1:14:46.180]  video of him in other events he literally looks like a dog you know when
[1:14:46.180 --> 1:14:50.940]  it's scared of thunder he just he like runs to his bodyguards if anybody goes
[1:14:50.940 --> 1:14:55.180]  hey Glenn Beck what about the new order he goes oh and like runs I mean we pull
[1:14:55.180 --> 1:15:01.260]  these videos up on YouTube because because he is cowardice he is weakness
[1:15:01.260 --> 1:15:05.260]  he is the new world order he is that's why they like him they go man this is a
[1:15:05.260 --> 1:15:09.700]  slime ball and they also know that regular good people see him and know
[1:15:09.700 --> 1:15:12.780]  there's something not right about that guy and then oh he's the new patriot
[1:15:12.780 --> 1:15:16.580]  leader he's meant to turn off everybody else and make the patriot movement look
[1:15:16.580 --> 1:15:23.380]  bad but also sucker in the dumbest I'm already a show is not about when back
[1:15:23.380 --> 1:15:27.380]  but I having him try to tell people that they can't be on city streets with
[1:15:27.380 --> 1:15:32.020]  signs and then calling that founding father patriotism again it's a bait and
[1:15:32.020 --> 1:15:38.260]  switch it's a you know what sandwich and I ain't taking a bite out of it
[1:15:38.260 --> 1:15:42.260]  are not enough of Beck enough of the nanny but I tell you another nanny was
[1:15:42.260 --> 1:15:46.900]  that James Mags he had on the show with him I mean this was like a nanny fest but
[1:15:46.900 --> 1:15:49.420]  of course it's cowards that serve the new world order that's what you've got to
[1:15:49.420 --> 1:15:53.740]  realize it's cowardly weak scum and they fool good men and women into thinking
[1:15:53.740 --> 1:15:56.580]  they're good and then they use our strength to carry out the new world order
[1:15:56.580 --> 1:16:00.860]  okay Matthew go ahead and there is an upside to this Alex we were at their
[1:16:00.860 --> 1:16:06.460]  first meeting um maybe two three weeks ago and um you know and and and the two
[1:16:06.460 --> 1:16:10.980]  or three organizers of the San Antonio tea party are just the biggest Glenn Beck
[1:16:10.980 --> 1:16:16.420]  rupees around and probably state police inform us but no actually they give off
[1:16:16.420 --> 1:16:21.300]  that uh that vibe very much so no no no just a certain look just just wait
[1:16:21.300 --> 1:16:26.500]  outside follow him home that that's it's state police okay go ahead oh yeah yeah
[1:16:26.500 --> 1:16:32.900]  I'd say it's a 100% 110% chance there's feds and state police is the
[1:16:32.900 --> 1:16:36.740]  state police are really federal with the funding I have all the reports here but
[1:16:36.740 --> 1:16:42.340]  job there's a 95% that it's the leaders but go ahead yeah and I don't doubt they
[1:16:42.340 --> 1:16:45.860]  sent off that vibe totally and um at their meeting someone asked well what are
[1:16:45.860 --> 1:16:48.980]  we gonna do after the tea party and I jumped in you know in the fed it's a
[1:16:48.980 --> 1:16:54.300]  week at two weeks after the 25th and I was like we got we had at that time we
[1:16:54.300 --> 1:16:59.020]  had a hundred Obama deception DVDs and a hundred fiat empire DVDs we started
[1:16:59.020 --> 1:17:02.620]  handing them out everybody was coming up to us oh thank you it's so good to see
[1:17:02.620 --> 1:17:06.300]  you guys here it's a one of our other younger guys hey it's so good to see you
[1:17:06.300 --> 1:17:09.980]  young people in action and there's the what website was that in the fed our
[1:17:09.980 --> 1:17:14.060]  us and um there's another older gentleman there and he was like you all
[1:17:14.060 --> 1:17:17.660]  need to go to info wars calm and people like what website that is that we're
[1:17:17.660 --> 1:17:21.180]  like yeah it's info wars and I had no and what were the state police down when
[1:17:21.180 --> 1:17:25.620]  you did that well yeah and that's what I'm building up to after the meeting the
[1:17:25.620 --> 1:17:29.580]  organizers pulled us aside and there is a peed off as anything they were upset
[1:17:29.580 --> 1:17:32.980]  they were telling us you know if you're gonna come here doing this send us an
[1:17:32.980 --> 1:17:37.560]  email yada yada yada and you know I did have about five or six end games that I
[1:17:37.560 --> 1:17:40.820]  handed out he was like you here to promote mr. Jones and we don't want
[1:17:40.820 --> 1:17:45.140]  nothing to do with that I was like hey we all talking about ending the tax in the
[1:17:45.140 --> 1:17:49.420]  tax to get it in the fed and don't you agree well yeah yeah yeah but you tell
[1:17:49.420 --> 1:17:52.580]  me I'm not against free speech but then he's like
[1:17:52.580 --> 1:17:55.860]  look you want to listen you want to break a major story now that we've said
[1:17:55.860 --> 1:18:01.420]  this they probably won't be there now follow them just run the plates on the
[1:18:01.420 --> 1:18:05.180]  car that they think you're so dumb it's probably gonna be even be an unmarked
[1:18:05.180 --> 1:18:11.420]  when you go outside well where do they have you guys meet well they have a
[1:18:11.420 --> 1:18:15.740]  little meetup and uh it's on meetup.com SAT party I'm a member of that
[1:18:15.740 --> 1:18:20.780]  meetup and I'm not aware do they have you meet though okay on that meeting at
[1:18:20.780 --> 1:18:25.940]  the at a hamburger joint called the time machine and one of the leaders of what
[1:18:25.940 --> 1:18:31.100]  the leaders look like um Eric Adams is one of the main organizers he's a guy
[1:18:31.100 --> 1:18:36.020]  who's a kiss Glenn Beck's hand to use the guy who blobby them to get down here
[1:18:36.020 --> 1:18:40.740]  not understand what you look like you see the skinny guy going bald um very full
[1:18:40.740 --> 1:18:44.380]  of himself he was going on and on that it was all him that brought Glenn Beck
[1:18:44.380 --> 1:18:49.060]  down he may be a guy he may not be a cop then okay well what's the other one
[1:18:49.060 --> 1:18:53.820]  look like oh there is one that that looks like you might be a cop big ol
[1:18:53.820 --> 1:18:58.860]  potbelly uh well there's usually other um they'll usually be one behind the
[1:18:58.860 --> 1:19:04.100]  front man that'll be the the operative so we yet we didn't actually see any of
[1:19:04.100 --> 1:19:09.140]  your your stereotype a bald head tattooed guys around but if anybody did

[1:19:29.980 --> 1:19:33.500]  they're not in super good shape by then because they've been on so many details

[1:26:58.340 --> 1:27:03.100]  flu but everybody's ignoring all the real bird flu news I have this federal
[1:27:03.100 --> 1:27:05.580]  report where they're saying gun owners are terrorists and the feds are getting
[1:27:05.580 --> 1:27:09.620]  ready to come after us and that free speech may not be free speech I've got
[1:27:09.620 --> 1:27:14.180]  all this eugenics news here and I want to go to your calls but I got Naomi
[1:27:14.180 --> 1:27:16.900]  Wolf coming up and then Joe Bannister I'll have no time to play these clips if

[1:27:24.020 --> 1:27:28.540]  Texas and Dustin in Germany I'll at least get to them go ahead Alex this is
[1:27:28.540 --> 1:27:35.340]  back in Houston hello I wanted to talk to you about a KHOU channel 11 here in
[1:27:35.340 --> 1:27:41.420]  the Houston area like three weeks ago I was up in the morning about 6 a.m. get
[1:27:41.420 --> 1:27:46.500]  ready to go to work and they made an announcement that said the Texas City
[1:27:46.500 --> 1:27:51.180]  refinery that's where I live will be releasing extra amounts of sulfur dioxide
[1:27:51.180 --> 1:27:56.540]  into the air due to a pressure problem and that it would affect people with
[1:27:56.540 --> 1:28:01.540]  allergies that day and I would never pay to no mind till I heard that person on
[1:28:01.540 --> 1:28:05.620]  your show last week talking about sulfur dioxide yeah that's in the official
[1:28:05.620 --> 1:28:10.380]  government reports they're spraying us with sulfur dioxide aluminum barium
[1:28:10.380 --> 1:28:17.860]  salts and other things that attack your body okay and so basically another
[1:28:17.860 --> 1:28:21.900]  question I had about that is I have an outdoor garden all organic and everything
[1:28:21.900 --> 1:28:29.140]  you think that crap is affecting it well I'm not I've seen the statistics and
[1:28:29.140 --> 1:28:33.420]  living in Houston or surrounding areas so many decades of toxic waste being
[1:28:33.420 --> 1:28:37.700]  dumped buried homes you know the oil companies and chemical companies a lot
[1:28:37.700 --> 1:28:40.460]  of the housing developments were built on oil company land where they had
[1:28:40.460 --> 1:28:45.740]  refineries and so that's why the cancer rates off the chart in Houston I know
[1:28:45.740 --> 1:28:48.780]  folks have to live there for the work and I got family lives down there but I'm
[1:28:48.780 --> 1:28:51.620]  gonna be a little kid driving in the car from Dallas and I'd say oh we're at
[1:28:51.620 --> 1:28:56.660]  Houston my eyes are burning and the stink and I mean I wouldn't live anywhere
[1:28:56.660 --> 1:29:02.340]  near Houston if I had a choice I mean those chemical plants all of it it is
[1:29:02.340 --> 1:29:06.740]  so bad I mean that's a real environmental problem and certainly you
[1:29:06.740 --> 1:29:11.900]  know none of that's good for your plants okay one more thing also on KHLU this
[1:29:11.900 --> 1:29:16.980]  week which is channel 11 here in Houston they're doing an expo they on they had to
[1:29:16.980 --> 1:29:22.340]  be tipped off from you but it says expo they are Houston's mass grave the
[1:29:22.340 --> 1:29:26.540]  commercial shows the plastic coffins it shows back toes it shows the freakin
[1:29:26.540 --> 1:29:31.140]  like semi-trucks going in and out of a plot I don't know where they got the
[1:29:31.140 --> 1:29:36.180]  video but it's definitely something from like one of your listeners or
[1:29:36.180 --> 1:29:40.020]  something I would say I bet my bottom dollar though they're gonna do a strong
[1:29:40.020 --> 1:29:43.300]  man they're gonna show the new vaults being built for all the veterans that
[1:29:43.300 --> 1:29:46.300]  are dying that are real and legitimate and mixing them with the plastic
[1:29:46.300 --> 1:29:50.020]  coffins hey the debate's over I have the federal documents they're building

[1:33:11.100 --> 1:33:20.860]  okay I got to get into this
[1:33:29.620 --> 1:33:34.980]  Homeland Security I called Homeland Security this is their federal report
[1:33:34.980 --> 1:33:44.220]  but on April 7th and it says basically gun owners are terrorists so I'm gonna go
[1:33:44.220 --> 1:33:52.980]  over this but first I'm gonna get into the latest internet hysteria out there
[1:33:52.980 --> 1:33:58.500]  and we're gonna go to that in a moment the first thing the first issue I need
[1:33:58.500 --> 1:34:06.380]  to cover is that you have these burial vaults all over the country being
[1:34:06.380 --> 1:34:14.940]  radically expanded at federal cemeteries massive increases and they talk
[1:34:14.940 --> 1:34:19.620]  about 700 plus thousand World War two Korean War vets are scheduled you know
[1:34:19.620 --> 1:34:25.140]  on average to die this year and I looked that number up it's accurate and they
[1:34:25.140 --> 1:34:28.300]  have suddenly changed the vaults where they put them side-by-side and put four
[1:34:28.300 --> 1:34:33.380]  coffins in each vault stacking them on each other like they do in Europe so I
[1:34:33.380 --> 1:34:43.420]  can buy that but then the feds come out and to pick this up off the floor then
[1:34:43.420 --> 1:34:46.860]  the feds come out and say there's no plans for mass graves and senator's it's
[1:34:46.860 --> 1:34:51.100]  all lies and say that the plastic FEMA coffins are made up when those are
[1:34:51.100 --> 1:34:54.180]  confirmed the company that sells them to the government confirms millions and
[1:34:54.180 --> 1:34:59.620]  these plastic coffins in Georgia and Colorado are out there and I have the
[1:34:59.620 --> 1:35:05.220]  Rocky Mountain news big paper in Colorado Jim Erickson Rocky Mountain is
[1:35:05.220 --> 1:35:09.980]  February a 2003 article titled state prepares for bioterrorism it says
[1:35:09.980 --> 1:35:14.620]  executive order signed for mass graves and incinerators dig mass graves under
[1:35:14.620 --> 1:35:19.740]  executive orders drafted for the event of bioterrorism attack cremate disease
[1:35:19.740 --> 1:35:24.620]  ridden cremate disease ridden corpses and dig mass graves and then it goes
[1:35:24.620 --> 1:35:30.340]  through the executive order for a pandemic so there's the Rocky Mountain
[1:35:30.340 --> 1:35:34.460]  news you can just Google that it's mainstream news mass graves repaired for
[1:35:34.460 --> 1:35:40.700]  US citizens state prepares for bioterrorism okay here is the state of
[1:35:40.700 --> 1:35:44.340]  New York Department of State division cemeteries this is posted on info wars
[1:35:44.340 --> 1:35:47.060]  dot-com you can call these phone numbers this went out all over the country
[1:35:47.060 --> 1:35:51.020]  they've been asking it ready for a bird flu or other pandemic to kill millions
[1:35:51.020 --> 1:35:56.420]  and how many bodies can they bury per acre and it is each cemetery ready to
[1:35:56.420 --> 1:36:00.060]  bury tens of thousands on their next acreage now that's from the state of
[1:36:00.060 --> 1:36:06.140]  New York right there and I covered this last week so what does the media do
[1:36:06.140 --> 1:36:10.660]  though they go out in Phoenix everywhere else and go all this is just a VA
[1:36:10.660 --> 1:36:16.020]  national cemetery for the dead it's no big deal but in truth we have confirmed
[1:36:16.020 --> 1:36:19.540]  they've been contacted there are preparing for more dead troops from
[1:36:19.540 --> 1:36:23.540]  combat not just troops that are dying who are veterans you know veterans have
[1:36:23.540 --> 1:36:27.700]  grown old or dying so that's how they do the strongman and that's the problem
[1:36:27.700 --> 1:36:32.740]  with all of this is people don't go to the real documentation they go to
[1:36:32.740 --> 1:36:40.300]  speculation and I guess a week and a half ago or something one of the
[1:36:40.300 --> 1:36:45.020]  Genesis shows and nice show Joyce Riley show here on Genesis I'm not
[1:36:45.020 --> 1:36:49.180]  criticizing her but I'll make that clear a caller calls in and if you really
[1:36:49.180 --> 1:36:53.420]  listen what the lady's saying it's all craziness I mean all I do is study how
[1:36:53.420 --> 1:36:58.060]  this stuff really operates what really goes on and what the real threats are
[1:36:58.060 --> 1:37:03.220]  and I know baloney when I hear it now what's real this is just what I printed
[1:37:03.220 --> 1:37:07.460]  up this morning homeless people died for bird flu vaccine trial in Poland live
[1:37:07.460 --> 1:37:11.500]  bird flu pharmaceutical companies paid homeless centers to tell them it was
[1:37:11.500 --> 1:37:15.260]  just a normal flu shot and it killed them better than hammer 23 died at one
[1:37:15.260 --> 1:37:19.500]  homeless facility 21 people died at one homeless center died alone and that's a
[1:37:19.500 --> 1:37:24.300]  London Telegraph right there I mean you can Google people die from bird flu
[1:37:24.300 --> 1:37:28.100]  vaccine you'll get hundreds of articles so there's that here's another one AFP
[1:37:28.100 --> 1:37:31.740]  health workers at agency French press health workers on trial for vaccine
[1:37:31.740 --> 1:37:35.420]  scam in Poland not health workers went on trial northern Poland Monday accused of
[1:37:35.420 --> 1:37:38.420]  having tested a vaccine against bird flu nearly 200 patients without their
[1:37:38.420 --> 1:37:43.780]  knowledge court officials said and it goes on now remember Baxter pharmaceutical
[1:37:43.780 --> 1:37:48.740]  18 countries ships out live bird flu the stuff that kills humans but not
[1:37:48.740 --> 1:37:52.180]  airborne yet they they order them to companies the sub companies without
[1:37:52.180 --> 1:37:56.820]  telling them what it is to mix it with a strip with a multi-strange of real
[1:37:56.820 --> 1:38:02.900]  human bird flu of regular human flu with the bird flu that humans can catch
[1:38:02.900 --> 1:38:07.260]  and that's how the exact way scientists and firms that looked at this in major
[1:38:07.260 --> 1:38:14.940]  newspapers you know Bloomberg Toronto Star Canadian Free Press all the big
[1:38:14.940 --> 1:38:19.300]  check papers big checkerpole paper said had scientists going this is exactly how
[1:38:19.300 --> 1:38:26.180]  you'd mutate bird flu this had to be done by design now there's no discussion
[1:38:26.180 --> 1:38:32.420]  of where that vaccine material went they just say it was shipped out and then you
[1:38:32.420 --> 1:38:37.780]  got these deaths now that ladies and gentlemen is something that serious
[1:38:37.780 --> 1:38:42.980]  needs to be looked at and so I don't blame people for getting hysterical when
[1:38:42.980 --> 1:38:48.180]  all of this you have a history of a government over and over and over again
[1:38:48.180 --> 1:38:51.700]  this totally criminal eugenics calling for a reduction of population of more
[1:38:51.700 --> 1:38:55.980]  than 50% upwards of 90% in some documents that's in the mainstream news today
[1:38:55.980 --> 1:39:00.460]  with government officials saying that you have all of this happening all of this
[1:39:00.460 --> 1:39:10.580]  unfolding so yes people are gonna get upset people are gonna hear this truck
[1:39:10.580 --> 1:39:15.940]  drivers are going to get upset you know people are gonna start getting
[1:39:15.940 --> 1:39:22.100]  hysterical and then the media is gonna focus in on the issues that aren't real
[1:39:22.100 --> 1:39:26.380]  you know this should have been top national news where is the vaccine where
[1:39:26.380 --> 1:39:30.300]  was the live bird flu vaccine ship to what's going on with it baxter is a
[1:39:30.300 --> 1:39:37.940]  u.s. company but I know how governments operate and I know they don't get random
[1:39:37.940 --> 1:39:41.220]  truck drivers and then tell them what they're carrying and then tell them we're
[1:39:41.220 --> 1:39:43.740]  gonna pay you in cash and we're gonna give you injections and you're gonna go
[1:39:43.740 --> 1:39:47.740]  down silos and bring this up and you know just the whole thing the way it
[1:39:47.740 --> 1:39:52.220]  comes together and then people grab that audio and put video of running up to a
[1:39:52.220 --> 1:39:57.460]  train stopped on the side of the road like it's Blair which project breathing
[1:39:57.460 --> 1:40:02.740]  heavily and they jump on board open container cars half the trains out there
[1:40:02.740 --> 1:40:07.100]  are empty they dump their load they go back but you know just some shaky
[1:40:07.100 --> 1:40:13.780]  camera work of cargo trains empty is then the total proof and the hysteria
[1:40:13.780 --> 1:40:19.980]  then ensues and glenn beckon people will go get things like this news story
[1:40:19.980 --> 1:40:24.900]  Linda Thompson putting out fake flame shooting out of the tank at Waco the
[1:40:24.900 --> 1:40:28.100]  media focused on that instead of the flare footage and the Delta Force
[1:40:28.100 --> 1:40:31.460]  admitting they went there and murdered everybody and time and newsweek admitting
[1:40:31.460 --> 1:40:35.500]  there were troops there and even foreign troops ignore all that real stuff
[1:40:35.500 --> 1:40:40.620]  let's focus on Linda Thompson's fake video then she puts out a fake video of
[1:40:40.620 --> 1:40:47.820]  a train repair shop I knew Beck was gonna go with that it was not hard so this
[1:40:47.820 --> 1:40:51.620]  is how they try to discredit us and this is what they do let's go ahead and play
[1:40:51.620 --> 1:40:56.660]  a few minutes of this show from a Genesis show I'm the power hour here it is
[1:40:56.660 --> 1:41:02.660]  I'm calling because I'm very concerned we have some actual proof that a trucker
[1:41:02.660 --> 1:41:08.900]  may actually be transporting stop right there bird flu back that up we may
[1:41:08.900 --> 1:41:15.860]  actually we have proof that a trucker may actually be that's kind of like this
[1:41:15.860 --> 1:41:20.700]  headline I was reading here earlier Gordon Brown has vowed to make every
[1:41:20.700 --> 1:41:25.980]  young person do 50 hours of volunteer work to make you then you read what he's
[1:41:25.980 --> 1:41:30.260]  introducing force compulsory national service it's a lot more than 50 hours
[1:41:30.260 --> 1:41:39.260]  that's just how they started so see listen to that clip again carefully we
[1:41:39.260 --> 1:41:45.180]  have proof that he may actually may be listen I'm calling because I'm very
[1:41:45.180 --> 1:41:49.860]  concerned we have some actual proof that a trucker may actually be
[1:41:49.860 --> 1:42:03.460]  transporting bird stop again we have proof we that he may be actually but I
[1:42:03.460 --> 1:42:07.780]  mean meanwhile they admit that they should it came out four years ago that
[1:42:07.780 --> 1:42:12.260]  weaponized bird flu crashed in a car wreck with FedEx was in the Associated
[1:42:12.260 --> 1:42:17.620]  Press nobody cared you have real bird flu being mailed out over 5,000 locations
[1:42:17.620 --> 1:42:22.140]  then then they mail it out to all these locations in Europe Baxter does and have
[1:42:22.140 --> 1:42:25.940]  it mixed with it but there's no hysteria no freaking out no Google videos no
[1:42:25.940 --> 1:42:29.860]  YouTube videos because it's documented
[1:42:31.660 --> 1:42:36.460]  see I mean I don't understand it there's all these videos with tens of
[1:42:36.460 --> 1:42:42.180]  millions of views of fake FEMA stuff but none of all the real things go ahead
[1:42:42.180 --> 1:42:47.540]  and finish up with it we have a federal agent who is aware who has taken the
[1:42:47.540 --> 1:42:53.540]  documents to many agencies including New York State Police the FBI in many many
[1:42:53.540 --> 1:42:59.540]  states infections control disease and what this trucker reported was that he
[1:42:59.540 --> 1:43:05.100]  works for Department of Homeland Security he's a Spanish man who is
[1:43:05.100 --> 1:43:09.380]  trucking an independent truck he goes down to the corner of Broadway and
[1:43:09.380 --> 1:43:12.140]  Clinton and Albany New York at the Department of Homeland Security
[1:43:12.140 --> 1:43:17.380]  facility every single evening for loads he said there are Raymore and Flanagan's
[1:43:17.380 --> 1:43:22.820]  and JB Hunt trucks ahead of him loading that he has taken loads from a silo
[1:43:22.820 --> 1:43:26.660]  above Glenn's fall his truck actually was lowered into the ground into a silo
[1:43:26.660 --> 1:43:31.180]  let's stop right there let's stop right there
[1:43:31.860 --> 1:43:42.620]  she later says it's missiles so he's in silos getting fresh bird flu but you
[1:43:42.620 --> 1:43:46.180]  listen to the whole tape never is there any proof of bird flu and then and then
[1:43:46.180 --> 1:43:50.740]  they're down on the missile silos and the missiles and then it's being trucked
[1:43:50.740 --> 1:43:54.500]  around and then they pay him cash and they go to windows to get their money
[1:43:54.500 --> 1:43:58.500]  and they go in back rooms it's not how the government operates just keep playing
[1:43:58.500 --> 1:44:04.260]  it the ground he was given a shot his arm to protect his family he transported
[1:44:04.260 --> 1:44:10.580]  um iced refrigerated loads to the Pentagon no I stopped there on stop there
[1:44:10.580 --> 1:44:14.180]  I mean I was watching you know a lot of our programs about the history of
[1:44:14.180 --> 1:44:19.500]  trucking they have federal lines and they have they have federal lines that
[1:44:19.500 --> 1:44:24.740]  carry nukes carry bio carry everything it's all government run but I mean
[1:44:24.740 --> 1:44:29.820]  listen to this he's this hysteria go back to it
[1:44:30.500 --> 1:44:38.100]  Tucson Arizona he was told that if he told told the federal investigator how
[1:44:38.100 --> 1:44:42.420]  he's getting paid through the Bank of America with a number he walks up to a
[1:44:42.420 --> 1:44:46.660]  window he put he presents his number he has taken to a back room and paid in
[1:44:46.660 --> 1:44:50.340]  cash to show the federal agent a hundred thousand dollars worth of receipts
[1:44:50.340 --> 1:44:53.820]  because he gets five thousand dollars per load and he's done as many as three
[1:44:53.820 --> 1:44:57.500]  loads per day okay now wait let me just stop you right here because this is
[1:44:57.500 --> 1:45:02.700]  amazing information to say the least now perhaps he is transporting vaccines
[1:45:02.700 --> 1:45:07.180]  refrigerated vaccines is that a possibility that anything that has to be
[1:45:07.180 --> 1:45:11.500]  iced either has to be an antigen or an antibody that's all we know but we know
[1:45:11.500 --> 1:45:15.100]  that they gave him a shot to transport it that they told him it was to protect
[1:45:15.100 --> 1:45:19.540]  his family that it is obviously something that has to be kept refrigerated on
[1:45:19.540 --> 1:45:24.220]  the one he did one load for a complete week to Tucson Arizona and back but the
[1:45:24.220 --> 1:45:27.660]  amount of money that they're paying him under the table through Bank of America
[1:45:27.660 --> 1:45:32.380]  only loading at night they call him and they ask him to come down to meetings at
[1:45:32.380 --> 1:45:35.020]  the Park and Holyam security at three o'clock in the morning will ask him how
[1:45:35.020 --> 1:45:39.100]  he's doing and send them back home and say fine you're okay go back home he has
[1:45:39.100 --> 1:45:43.620]  other truckers he knows of a trucker with a fifty-three foot bed unit that
[1:45:43.620 --> 1:45:48.140]  took a missile type but he was able to see his load and that was taken out to
[1:45:48.140 --> 1:45:52.460]  Phoenix Arizona he was given eighteen thousand dollars to truck that load two
[1:45:52.460 --> 1:45:57.300]  times it was eight eighty tons and he blew his brakes the Department of
[1:45:57.300 --> 1:46:02.820]  Homeland Security took care of it he also has been to two silos he's been to
[1:46:02.820 --> 1:46:06.300]  many cities with his loads he's continuously working for Department of
[1:46:06.300 --> 1:46:10.100]  Homeland Security and they are reloading will relocating him since the
[1:46:10.100 --> 1:46:14.300]  since the federal agents and the state police were notified we were notified
[1:46:14.300 --> 1:46:18.860]  that he is being relocated to Tucson Arizona at a base 15 miles below Tucson
[1:46:18.860 --> 1:46:24.300]  as I know let me just ask you Mary how did you come upon this information um I
[1:46:24.300 --> 1:46:28.820]  can't I can't say I mean I just what I'm saying already probably put me in
[1:46:28.820 --> 1:46:34.820]  danger I can't I can't play anymore I can't listen to it folks it just gets
[1:46:34.820 --> 1:46:40.620]  more whacked out from there again the news health workers on trial for vaccine
[1:46:40.620 --> 1:46:44.980]  scam in Poland bird flu injections homeless people died after bird flu
[1:46:44.980 --> 1:46:51.940]  vaccine trial and that's mainstream news and then the video ends with people
[1:46:51.940 --> 1:46:55.900]  hysterically running up to a train with it shaking everywhere and it's just an
[1:46:55.900 --> 1:46:59.660]  empty train I mean I there's train tracks all around here the trains you know
[1:46:59.660 --> 1:47:02.300]  half of them are full going one direction other half are empty going the
[1:47:02.300 --> 1:47:05.500]  other direction I guess I could run up hyperventilating and shoot video of a
[1:47:05.500 --> 1:47:09.980]  trainer and again I'm not blaming people for picking up on this this is what
[1:47:09.980 --> 1:47:13.020]  happens is the general public wakes up it doesn't have the deep discernment yet
[1:47:13.020 --> 1:47:17.940]  this is what happens because the government has tested chemical
[1:47:17.940 --> 1:47:21.740]  biological radiological they have carried out the just ski experiment all
[1:47:21.740 --> 1:47:25.220]  the other things people know about there is some weird stuff going on with bird
[1:47:25.220 --> 1:47:32.900]  flu but they just ship it around in FedEx trucks and then when it's nukes and
[1:47:32.900 --> 1:47:36.300]  actual bio weapons and things they ship them on government lines government
[1:47:36.300 --> 1:47:44.580]  contracted lines and it's just done nonchalantly but to say refrigerated
[1:47:44.580 --> 1:47:50.980]  stuff out of missile silos to other missile silos and then he had a missile
[1:47:50.980 --> 1:47:57.140]  and he saw it I mean you listen to that folks I've heard it a million times I
[1:47:57.140 --> 1:48:02.340]  know bull when I hear it and I stake my right arm that this is the biggest load
[1:48:02.340 --> 1:48:06.500]  of malarkey I've ever heard in my life now again I don't blame you know I could
[1:48:06.500 --> 1:48:10.180]  take a crazy call like that and I would certainly entertain it I'm not blaming
[1:48:10.180 --> 1:48:14.460]  anybody but you know for that and I don't blame listeners and people out
[1:48:14.460 --> 1:48:18.300]  there for posting the videos and asking people about it but you asked me what I
[1:48:18.300 --> 1:48:22.900]  thought of it folks and I've told you now and it just goes on and on from there
[1:48:22.900 --> 1:48:28.300]  about how he's in the witness protection program now and the feds don't want
[1:48:28.300 --> 1:48:34.940]  people to know and it's just unbelievable meanwhile no one is going to talk
[1:48:34.940 --> 1:48:38.380]  about how they're doing bird flu trials that are killing people nobody's gonna
[1:48:38.380 --> 1:48:42.780]  talk about where are the 18 countries flu vaccines they mix with bird flu
[1:48:42.780 --> 1:48:46.380]  nobody's gonna talk about that that's not what's important that's not a big
[1:48:46.380 --> 1:48:53.260]  deal confirmed people being injected and dying or HPV being injected in school
[1:48:53.260 --> 1:48:56.620]  girls and then dying all over the country and all over the world or how
[1:48:56.620 --> 1:49:01.020]  they want to force boys to take it see in the in-plane view some African
[1:49:01.020 --> 1:49:05.460]  countries with 46% of the women dying of HIV Bayer knowingly shipping out over a
[1:49:05.460 --> 1:49:10.380]  million ampoules with Baxter that has the bird flu being shipped out with their
[1:49:10.380 --> 1:49:15.300]  vaccines filled with live HIV and hepatitis oh that's we don't want to
[1:49:15.300 --> 1:49:21.300]  hear about that we want to run up to a train hyperventilating like I mean show
[1:49:21.300 --> 1:49:24.940]  that video at the very end few of the last minute show that to folks on that
[1:49:24.940 --> 1:49:47.260]  video here it is that's a union percent you don't need shackles and benches when
[1:49:47.260 --> 1:49:51.660]  you think about it because who gives a shit while gonna be put in an oven
[1:49:51.660 --> 1:49:55.700]  oops I think somebody took a longer clip I'd actually seen one that didn't have
[1:49:55.700 --> 1:50:01.580]  that in it anyways just don't don't play the audio I apologize for that folks
[1:50:01.580 --> 1:50:05.220]  I saw a different clip because they've added something to the end of it but but
[1:50:05.220 --> 1:50:09.900]  I mean he just runs up and shows an empty train and then Glenn Beck will show
[1:50:09.900 --> 1:50:15.500]  this and say we made it up and that's how the video ends so so this is how the
[1:50:15.500 --> 1:50:19.340]  hysteria and the insane-ness to where people don't know what's true anymore
[1:50:19.340 --> 1:50:23.860]  can you guys play without the audio I just want folks to see the the proof I
[1:50:23.860 --> 1:50:36.220]  mean what does this have to do with bird flu and silos and it goes on and on I
[1:50:36.220 --> 1:50:42.180]  mean this is the footage shot Blair which style on purpose water all over the
[1:50:42.180 --> 1:50:50.940]  lens on this is a style folks and then he runs up into a train and it's it's a
[1:50:50.940 --> 1:50:54.340]  Union Pacific train just sitting there waiting to be let go to a factory to be

[1:52:13.100 --> 1:52:18.020]  would like to see the Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama
[1:52:18.020 --> 1:52:21.900]  is working for the best interest of the American people while Obama's already
[1:52:21.900 --> 1:52:26.540]  fudging yeah but since day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a

[1:54:04.500 --> 1:54:13.380]  earlier in the show I mentioned how Newsweek reported that Russians were in
[1:54:13.380 --> 1:54:19.780]  Waco with a quote white noise machine and some subliminal machine some mind
[1:54:19.780 --> 1:54:24.660]  control system and then Tim who works here in the office comes back goes look
[1:54:24.660 --> 1:54:29.820]  what we just got in the mail I had this years ago this is from 1994 beyond the
[1:54:29.820 --> 1:54:36.100]  Prozac is the cover story and February 7th 1994 and it talks about the Russians
[1:54:36.100 --> 1:54:39.460]  and mind control the techniques used include transmissions that could have
[1:54:39.460 --> 1:54:43.420]  convinced Koresh he was hearing the voice of God inside his head the Air Force
[1:54:43.420 --> 1:54:49.660]  offered a top-secret non-lethal system and it goes on and it describes it on a
[1:54:49.660 --> 1:54:56.340]  bunch of the pages in here so this is interesting I want to thank the listener
[1:54:56.340 --> 1:55:01.700]  that sent us this because I had that years ago and lost it now it goes back
[1:55:01.700 --> 1:55:09.740]  into the pile but look I don't I don't like policing what people say and do
[1:55:09.740 --> 1:55:12.980]  here on air it's just when I get hundreds and hundreds of emails and
[1:55:12.980 --> 1:55:18.920]  phone calls going oh my god run for the hills they're releasing bird flu I go
[1:55:18.920 --> 1:55:22.900]  wait a minute it may you might want to run to the hills I mean I've actually
[1:55:22.900 --> 1:55:26.220]  thought about moving to the country because stuff's getting so crazy in the
[1:55:26.220 --> 1:55:35.300]  event something like this happens because I mean they are shipping bird flu
[1:55:35.300 --> 1:55:39.300]  around the world they are shooting people up with it people are dying and
[1:55:39.300 --> 1:55:43.900]  that's mainstream news and then I post mainstream news and then people the
[1:55:43.900 --> 1:55:48.980]  news calls me bad for even reporting on it so I understand why people are
[1:55:48.980 --> 1:55:52.540]  freaking out and thinking everything is bird flu being shipped around to kill
[1:55:52.540 --> 1:55:56.420]  them I just never understand why the craziest stuff in the most
[1:55:56.420 --> 1:56:00.380]  incredible stuff is what's put to the fore what's put to the forefront instead
[1:56:00.380 --> 1:56:07.740]  of all the serious stuff and that's what we cover here is what can be proven but
[1:56:07.740 --> 1:56:12.940]  again I don't blame people not respect and others you know for posting this and
[1:56:12.940 --> 1:56:17.780]  asking because when you've got a government this corrupt this evil this
[1:56:17.780 --> 1:56:21.700]  bad who's been caught doing these things over and over again I mean I'll use one
[1:56:21.700 --> 1:56:25.100]  example of literally thousands and we put some of these examples in my film in
[1:56:25.100 --> 1:56:28.620]  game you know all mainstream government documents mainstream news imagine the
[1:56:28.620 --> 1:56:33.100]  U.S. government taking 4,000 plus foster children and putting them in
[1:56:33.100 --> 1:56:36.580]  radiation chambers and flipping a switch and killing them just to test
[1:56:36.580 --> 1:56:40.900]  radiation and some of them they gave me a dose that killed them in a month some
[1:56:40.900 --> 1:56:45.300]  of them gave them doses that kill them in an hour you know the reports would be
[1:56:45.300 --> 1:56:48.820]  the child cried and bled from every orifice for one week and then died I
[1:56:48.820 --> 1:56:52.660]  mean they'd have film cameras filming that you know the source coming up the
[1:56:52.660 --> 1:56:57.100]  teeth falling out the blood and this is zombie stuff picture the kids being
[1:56:57.100 --> 1:57:02.220]  being radiated in the the doctors having them you know chain down watching how
[1:57:02.220 --> 1:57:08.060]  they die or giving you pregnant gi's wives uranium and plutonium pills and
[1:57:08.060 --> 1:57:10.980]  saying this is vitamins and then have film cameras there when they had the
[1:57:10.980 --> 1:57:15.180]  miscarriage to see what it would do this is all Joseph Mingola stuff so do I
[1:57:15.180 --> 1:57:18.060]  think they could be shipping bird flew around and doing all this well yeah I
[1:57:18.060 --> 1:57:26.060]  know they are FedEx trucks crashing it dumps out all the street that Google car
[1:57:26.060 --> 1:57:29.780]  crash bird flew or truck crashes with bird flu that was like four years ago
[1:57:29.780 --> 1:57:35.700]  was it made the news but instead it's all this I can't tell you silos missiles
[1:57:35.700 --> 1:57:39.580]  iced they pan and cash that that's not the government does they all do it
[1:57:39.580 --> 1:57:44.220]  nonchalant it's government trucks doing that or if it's research facility
[1:57:44.220 --> 1:57:47.620]  shipping bird flew out to hundreds of universities and institutions it's done
[1:57:47.620 --> 1:57:55.780]  by FedEx which is crazy and so I just asked people stick with what you can
[1:57:55.780 --> 1:58:02.980]  prove please get it out to people that they're shipping out bird flew all over
[1:58:02.980 --> 1:58:09.060]  the place and shooting people up with it I mean this isn't something that's
[1:58:09.060 --> 1:58:14.860]  speculative this is proven this is documented this is admitted all right
[1:58:14.860 --> 1:58:19.420]  I'm gonna come back and do five focused minutes I should have spent all day on
[1:58:19.420 --> 1:58:26.300]  this but I got sidetracked on the latest this this isn't a federally written
[1:58:26.300 --> 1:58:30.340]  report the state level this is a internal Homeland Security document up on
[1:58:30.340 --> 1:58:33.700]  info wars.com gun owners or terrorists then we got Naomi Wolfe coming up and
[1:58:33.700 --> 1:58:39.500]  then Joe Bannister this is key this is key but we had to cover the other thing
[1:58:39.500 --> 1:58:53.980]  because it's discrediting hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a
[1:58:53.980 --> 1:58:57.100]  long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more
[1:58:57.100 --> 1:59:00.540]  important than ever we need to be independent and food and water is the
[1:59:00.540 --> 1:59:04.140]  key you'll never have to stand in a bread line you have your own bread you'll
[1:59:04.140 --> 1:59:07.860]  never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in
[1:59:07.860 --> 1:59:11.620]  any emergency if you simply prepare no one is gonna take care of your family

[2:00:20.700 --> 2:00:28.140]  Alex Jones okay I'm gonna bring this up to Joe banister coming up later former
[2:00:28.140 --> 2:00:36.060]  Treasury officer in enforcement because he's been listed in my reports and
[2:00:36.060 --> 2:00:41.580]  others they also list mainline libertarian grips as terrorist so we'll
[2:00:41.580 --> 2:00:45.700]  cover this more in the last hour today when Joe banister joins us talk about
[2:00:45.700 --> 2:00:48.860]  the IRS a lot of other issues Naomi Wolfs coming up but right now I'm gonna
[2:00:48.860 --> 2:00:55.260]  get into it unclassified for official use only right-wing extremism current
[2:00:55.260 --> 2:00:59.220]  economic and political climate fueling re-assurgence and radicalization and
[2:00:59.220 --> 2:01:04.060]  recruitment and the stories up on info wars dot com and a story written by
[2:01:04.060 --> 2:01:09.940]  Kurt Nemo I called the FBI I called the the different organizations that are
[2:01:09.940 --> 2:01:17.700]  here in the document the NICC the national information coordinating
[2:01:17.700 --> 2:01:22.340]  center I called them and confirm it you can call the phone numbers on here if
[2:01:22.340 --> 2:01:25.900]  you'd like to talk to the FBI and others you are certainly welcome to do
[2:01:25.900 --> 2:01:33.180]  show and what does the document say that's not my marked copy here's my
[2:01:33.180 --> 2:01:38.180]  marked copy they were pulling these copies down off the web last night before
[2:01:38.180 --> 2:01:43.140]  we got it put on our server so I had a couple copies printed okay it says the
[2:01:43.140 --> 2:01:46.460]  same exact wording that are on the state documents written by the feds about
[2:01:46.460 --> 2:01:50.460]  this is secret you can't release it and any cops that release will get in big
[2:01:50.460 --> 2:01:55.420]  trouble this is section you key findings the economic downturn in the
[2:01:55.420 --> 2:01:59.660]  election of the first African-American president present unique drivers for
[2:01:59.660 --> 2:02:02.740]  right-wing radicalization and recruitment so they imply everybody's
[2:02:02.740 --> 2:02:08.140]  racist it says right-wing extremists have capitalized on the election the
[2:02:08.140 --> 2:02:12.020]  first American president and are focused in the efforts on to recruit new
[2:02:12.020 --> 2:02:15.140]  members mobilize existing supporters well yeah you're supposed to that in
[2:02:15.140 --> 2:02:19.220]  America and mobilizing its turning and broaden their scope and appeal through
[2:02:19.220 --> 2:02:23.940]  propaganda but they have not yet turned to their attack plan then they go into
[2:02:23.940 --> 2:02:29.220]  listing mainline gun grids we haven't yet turned to the attack plan you haven't
[2:02:29.220 --> 2:02:33.820]  burned up any churches you lately feds huh the possible passage of new
[2:02:33.820 --> 2:02:38.440]  restrictions on firearms in the return of militia veterans military veterans
[2:02:38.440 --> 2:02:42.260]  excuse me facing significant challenges reintegrating in their community so it
[2:02:42.260 --> 2:02:52.380]  goes on to attack veterans big time here is a page three proposed imposition of
[2:02:52.380 --> 2:02:56.900]  firearms restrictions that's introduced bills and weapons bands are attracting
[2:02:56.900 --> 2:03:00.500]  new members into the ranks of right-wing extremist groups as well as
[2:03:00.500 --> 2:03:03.980]  potential spur some of them to begin planning and training for violence
[2:03:03.980 --> 2:03:07.700]  against the government the high volume of purchases this is the key the high
[2:03:07.700 --> 2:03:11.100]  volume of purchases of stockpiling of weapons and ammunition by right-wing
[2:03:11.100 --> 2:03:14.860]  extremists in anticipation of restrictions and bands in some parts of
[2:03:14.860 --> 2:03:19.980]  the country continue to be a primary concern the law enforcement so their
[2:03:19.980 --> 2:03:23.820]  primary concern is the fact that you're buying guns and ammo they say later that
[2:03:23.820 --> 2:03:29.620]  everybody buying guns and ammo is basically a terrorist their primary
[2:03:29.620 --> 2:03:33.980]  concern law enforcement is you're buying guns and ammo in addition the
[2:03:33.980 --> 2:03:36.900]  historical election of an african-american president the prospect of
[2:03:36.900 --> 2:03:40.380]  policy changes are providing to be a driving force for right-wing extremists
[2:03:40.380 --> 2:03:46.340]  recruitment and radicalization and they go and talk about terrorism they say
[2:03:46.340 --> 2:03:51.380]  anti-government ideology is racist nothing to do with it it goes on to say
[2:03:51.380 --> 2:03:55.780]  exploiting economic downturn the perceived loss of u.s. jobs in
[2:03:55.780 --> 2:04:01.180]  manufacturing construction sectors and home foreclosures is anti-semitic so I
[2:04:01.180 --> 2:04:04.820]  just quoted that they say the perceived loss they're going to say it's
[2:04:04.820 --> 2:04:11.340]  propaganda that we're lying about the economy and that we're terrorist so it
[2:04:11.340 --> 2:04:16.220]  goes on to say historical presidential election social programs to non minorities
[2:04:16.220 --> 2:04:20.100]  and firearms restrictions being the policies of iraq obama is also they're
[2:04:20.100 --> 2:04:23.120]  saying we're coming after your guns and the terrorists don't want that the
[2:04:23.120 --> 2:04:28.940]  terrorists are buying guns and ammo it goes on to say
[2:04:29.940 --> 2:04:34.700]  economic hardship and extremism it says prominent anti-government conspiracy
[2:04:34.700 --> 2:04:39.340]  theories of incorporated aspects of the impending economic collapse to intensify
[2:04:39.340 --> 2:04:47.460]  fear and paranoia says we're making up detention camps and the my act though
[2:04:47.460 --> 2:04:50.820]  they admit they built them and then it gets into they may have to restrict free
[2:04:50.820 --> 2:04:55.620]  speech we'll cover that when we come back so I stay with us this is a federal

[2:08:59.340 --> 2:09:04.340]  hour got this newest secret federal document that I call the FBI confirmed
[2:09:04.340 --> 2:09:09.420]  is theirs and it it it goes on to basically say if you don't want to hand
[2:09:09.420 --> 2:09:13.500]  your guns in you don't like what the banks are doing to you you don't like
[2:09:13.500 --> 2:09:17.620]  Barack Obama it's because he's black you're racist and that gun owners buying
[2:09:17.620 --> 2:09:22.500]  ammo and guns are terrorist it says that these are terrorist and that our number
[2:09:22.500 --> 2:09:25.140]  one threat is the American people so they're here they are saying your your
[2:09:25.140 --> 2:09:29.700]  gun owners are terrorist debates over appropriate legislation levels enforcement
[2:09:29.700 --> 2:09:33.220]  policy generally fall in the realm of protected political speech generally
[2:09:33.220 --> 2:09:37.420]  under the First Amendment but in some cases anti-immigration or strident
[2:09:37.420 --> 2:09:40.860]  pro enforcement fervor has been directed against specific groups and as the
[2:09:40.860 --> 2:09:44.100]  potential to turn violent that means when the illegal aliens on hundreds of
[2:09:44.100 --> 2:09:47.860]  videos I've seen beat up all ladies with two by fours then they arrest the old
[2:09:47.860 --> 2:09:51.820]  ladies and you can Google those videos the illegal aliens well it's it's in my
[2:09:51.820 --> 2:09:56.860]  film in game we had a little bonus 17-minute film battle for the Republic
[2:09:56.860 --> 2:10:00.380]  and it shows illegal aliens blocking traffic without a permit and a guy's
[2:10:00.380 --> 2:10:04.460]  you know is waving his hand out the car saying I shut up the cops come over
[2:10:04.460 --> 2:10:07.620]  knock us you know teeth out bloodiest face and the illegals come over and
[2:10:07.620 --> 2:10:11.380]  celebrate with them the officers celebrate the death of freedom and this
[2:10:11.380 --> 2:10:16.220]  is how the tyranny works so that's in my film in fact Google battle for the
[2:10:16.220 --> 2:10:21.220]  Republic and Alex Jones battle for the Republic it's an extra from in game it's

[2:10:34.220 --> 2:10:37.700]  drivers they admit they've introduced gun bans they say when they ban the guns
[2:10:37.700 --> 2:10:41.860]  the American terrorist gun owner will fight back you can go read that they
[2:10:41.860 --> 2:10:46.540]  say stockpiling weapons and ammunition is right wing terror and that they're
[2:10:46.540 --> 2:10:51.780]  terrorist they say you have a right to keep their arms but that means that they
[2:10:51.780 --> 2:10:55.860]  can ban your guns they say yes it's a right for us to ban your guns that's in
[2:10:55.860 --> 2:11:00.660]  the section under legislative it says the court reaffirming individuals right
[2:11:00.660 --> 2:11:03.460]  to keep their arms under the second amendment to the Constitution but left
[2:11:03.460 --> 2:11:07.340]  open the debate no it didn't the precise contours of that right because debate
[2:11:07.340 --> 2:11:13.540]  and it goes on to say they can restrict it so we'll be covering that just

[2:13:42.900 --> 2:13:49.100]  to you again Alex that's me Naomi okay Naomi tell us about your new film
[2:13:49.100 --> 2:13:57.060]  sure it was put together in great haste because we were very concerned about the
[2:13:57.060 --> 2:14:02.420]  direction the country was going in some ways you know still is and what it is
[2:14:02.420 --> 2:14:07.020]  is it's bringing to life the second class book I wrote the end of America
[2:14:07.020 --> 2:14:11.340]  which is basically the 10 steps to fascism and arguing that well we've
[2:14:11.340 --> 2:14:15.020]  talked about this here with your community before that we're seeing in
[2:14:15.020 --> 2:14:20.540]  the United States or we have we have been in some ways we still are the you
[2:14:20.540 --> 2:14:26.540]  know rapid buildup of the kinds of things you see when a leadership wants to
[2:14:26.540 --> 2:14:30.140]  close an open society or crush a democracy movement and what was so and
[2:14:30.140 --> 2:14:34.620]  put together by beautiful filmmakers very well regarded Annie Sunberg and
[2:14:34.620 --> 2:14:39.460]  Ricky Stern who are prize-winning filmmakers and what was exciting to me
[2:14:39.460 --> 2:14:46.420]  as an author is that you know you write about things like police brutality or
[2:14:46.420 --> 2:14:49.500]  the military moving in in St. Paul as you mentioned in your intro are you
[2:14:49.500 --> 2:14:55.100]  right about you know my hair are are being stopped at you know JFK and taken
[2:14:55.100 --> 2:14:59.940]  Syria tortured for two years and without due process and you and it's kind of
[2:14:59.940 --> 2:15:04.860]  abstract even if you use your greatest skills as an author but for me to see
[2:15:04.860 --> 2:15:08.620]  these actual people come to life and see the filmmakers you know interview
[2:15:08.620 --> 2:15:13.580]  James E who was snatched away from Guantanamo and you know kept in a Navy
[2:15:13.580 --> 2:15:17.660]  break for seven months and you know seeing the hair are talking directly to
[2:15:17.660 --> 2:15:21.940]  us and you know see this actual footage that citizens got in St. Paul that they
[2:15:21.940 --> 2:15:25.820]  had to to bury in the ground because footage was being confiscated by the
[2:15:25.820 --> 2:15:29.980]  militarized police by the military at the RNC I'm seeing this footage smuggled
[2:15:29.980 --> 2:15:34.380]  out of military movements against citizens you know because beyond what
[2:15:34.380 --> 2:15:38.900]  any writer can do with with a computer so it's I'm very proud of it I'm very
[2:15:38.900 --> 2:15:42.940]  excited about it and what I've been asking people to do and the filmmakers
[2:15:42.940 --> 2:15:46.140]  and you know the scratch with democracy campaign we've started have been asking
[2:15:46.140 --> 2:15:51.300]  people to do is and is why we made it available for a while for free online
[2:15:51.300 --> 2:15:57.060]  too is the that you should if you support the message hold it you know a
[2:15:57.060 --> 2:16:03.420]  gathering in your home and screen it and then pass out copies of the death

[2:16:20.900 --> 2:16:24.740]  Naomi Wolf back on the line with us right now you actually got the film the
[2:16:24.740 --> 2:16:29.900]  end of America yeah where they use US Army on citizens and then last week the
[2:16:29.900 --> 2:16:34.140]  governor told the regular army we heard you're gonna run checkpoints on the
[2:16:34.140 --> 2:16:37.620]  highways of citizens and search everybody's cars you can't do that and the
[2:16:37.620 --> 2:16:44.180]  army said shut up we're under pd-51 foul North com John Warren Defense
[2:16:44.180 --> 2:16:48.940]  Authorization Act and the local newspapers reported that they were out
[2:16:48.940 --> 2:16:55.060]  there running the checkpoints and I had a state rep on about that that's what
[2:16:55.060 --> 2:17:05.020]  this country has turned into ladies and gentlemen that's what we have become now

[2:18:16.620 --> 2:18:21.900]  militarized baylanks of you know kind of looks like riot police but it turns out
[2:18:21.900 --> 2:18:28.060]  that the military was actually in in you know they're a president at the
[2:18:28.060 --> 2:18:34.220]  convention advising and doting the police and they round up citizens and you

[2:33:58.540 --> 2:34:01.020]  now some of them have a criminal government going after our second
[2:34:01.020 --> 2:34:05.380]  amendment now they get to blame the narco terrorist state the phony drug war
[2:34:05.380 --> 2:34:11.500]  that the disarmed victims in Mexico look at all the places they point at and

[2:34:26.780 --> 2:34:31.340]  calls Chris in Tennessee Chris you're on the air hello Alex Alex you're exactly
[2:34:31.340 --> 2:34:35.580]  right about Glenn Beck I remember his first interview with Ron Paul when he
[2:34:35.580 --> 2:34:40.100]  was saying he had to wear a bulletproof vest and Secret Service was guarding his
[2:34:40.100 --> 2:34:44.300]  family and now he wants the supporters of the Ron Paul supporters and he's
[2:34:44.300 --> 2:34:49.140]  definitely a fake and a phony but Alex what I want is he's talked on air about
[2:34:49.140 --> 2:34:54.180]  how he hates the cases of men hold on hold on hold on sir sir sir I mean you
[2:34:54.180 --> 2:34:57.060]  brought up Glenn Beck you know what I'm gonna be I'm gonna write a note about
[2:34:57.060 --> 2:35:00.500]  Beck since you brought him up because every time a listener reminds me of
[2:35:00.500 --> 2:35:04.860]  something I remember that I'm not even attacking him with one-tenth of the
[2:35:04.860 --> 2:35:09.220]  truth but you're absolutely right about Beck I remember him saying Secret
[2:35:09.220 --> 2:35:13.020]  Service was protecting him he hates no one like 9-11 truthers he hates the
[2:35:13.020 --> 2:35:17.300]  victims families he hates the Patriot movement he hates militias he hates gun
[2:35:17.300 --> 2:35:20.940]  owners and then the feds came to him and said look you really want to burn these
[2:35:20.940 --> 2:35:26.140]  people we love you we you hate America we will we love you back literally this
[2:35:26.140 --> 2:35:31.220]  is you co-op them so we can destroy them and Beck said absolutely sorry go
[2:35:31.220 --> 2:35:35.940]  ahead within the last two weeks and I want to know what do you think that would
[2:35:35.940 --> 2:35:43.420]  do to our economy with a mad cow beef recall well I mean they have been
[2:35:43.420 --> 2:35:48.540]  hyping that and there's no doubt the government puts out reports in England
[2:35:48.540 --> 2:35:52.140]  and the US saying we're crazy we're insane there's something wrong with us we
[2:35:52.140 --> 2:35:56.860]  shouldn't want them to have these rendering plants where they mix dead
[2:35:56.860 --> 2:36:02.380]  animals dead cats dead dogs from the euthanasia facilities this is mainstream
[2:36:02.380 --> 2:36:09.420]  news dead pigs dead cows rotten dead animals their feces their intestines
[2:36:09.420 --> 2:36:12.660]  they just scoop up the guts hole and dump them in and then they mix them
[2:36:12.660 --> 2:36:17.260]  together into a sludge and they feed that to cows now they don't just again
[2:36:17.260 --> 2:36:23.020]  feed me to cows that aren't meant to not eat meat and have three stomachs they
[2:36:23.020 --> 2:36:28.420]  are meant they're feeding them rotten meat and so it has these crystals in it
[2:36:28.420 --> 2:36:32.300]  and then that gets in our brains and now they're reporting 20 year olds are
[2:36:32.300 --> 2:36:36.380]  getting Alzheimer's 15 year olds are getting at 30 year olds and they say
[2:36:36.380 --> 2:36:41.300]  that's a normal part of life now and then of course the the all the metals in
[2:36:41.300 --> 2:36:45.140]  the foods do it as well in the vaccines it all adds together and they just say
[2:36:45.140 --> 2:36:50.300]  look it's normal to be 15 years old and have Alzheimer's now come on don't be
[2:36:50.300 --> 2:36:58.860]  extremist eat the beef and the the prions precipitate out near bones show
[2:36:58.860 --> 2:37:02.420]  it's the it's the meat off the back of the animal tea bones and things like
[2:37:02.420 --> 2:37:08.020]  that you want to watch out for but I think you bring up a good point go ahead

[2:37:23.980 --> 2:37:27.820]  and the rest of the thing that would that exactly happened that day if you
[2:37:27.820 --> 2:37:32.380]  were if you had an investigation I think that right now is the time to go after
[2:37:32.380 --> 2:37:38.620]  GW Bush and to get to the truth of the matter all right open murder investigation
[2:37:38.620 --> 2:37:41.900]  Alex you have a good day thanks yeah I don't think Obama's gonna be doing that
[2:37:41.900 --> 2:37:45.780]  joining up with me Obama's there to protect Bush and continue with the

[2:38:30.980 --> 2:38:34.980]  that when I say it I've studied them and people ask I go back to rape why would a

[2:38:54.260 --> 2:38:59.220]  public is they this is the ether in which they swim the lack of

[2:39:08.140 --> 2:39:12.460]  scum and good people need to rise up and deal with them if we take action
[2:39:12.460 --> 2:39:19.220]  there's nothing they can do Dennis in Florida you're on the air come ahead

[2:39:23.980 --> 2:39:31.340]  yes Alex good afternoon just briefly about Beck just remember this loyal
[2:39:31.340 --> 2:39:36.820]  opposition okay they've been doing this for centuries man he didn't pay those
[2:39:36.820 --> 2:39:42.380]  guys on a man had millions of dollars to tell you the truth but anyway what I
[2:39:42.380 --> 2:39:48.940]  want to inform you about finally after many years of my dealings with the IRS
[2:39:48.940 --> 2:39:54.100]  when they have many acts of sedition they committed against me and Supreme
[2:39:54.100 --> 2:40:00.220]  Court rulings I finally received a document I got him they sent me a
[2:40:00.220 --> 2:40:06.420]  document on iris.gov saying that the 16th amendment was a tax on all
[2:40:06.420 --> 2:40:11.500]  individuals now anybody who knows words of art and legal definition the
[2:40:11.500 --> 2:40:16.900]  vocabulous artist knows that individuals means men and women no you're
[2:40:16.900 --> 2:40:21.580]  saying it's a direct tax the brushaber versus Union Pacific Railroad or
[2:40:21.580 --> 2:40:27.500]  Anmore case is it says it's an indirect tax and you we also know that from the
[2:40:27.500 --> 2:40:32.500]  doll versus Mitchell Brothers case the 16th amendment is a tax on corporations
[2:40:32.500 --> 2:40:37.300]  I got your address no absolutely but they don't care they're criminals I mean
[2:40:37.300 --> 2:40:40.780]  you know the IRS didn't exist until 1913 when the private banks took over they
[2:40:40.780 --> 2:40:43.540]  had to have their way just like we're a third-world country to have the money
[2:40:43.540 --> 2:40:49.940]  paid to the bankers and and and we've had a financial coup since then and now
[2:40:49.940 --> 2:40:53.500]  the bankers are getting ready to finally fold the US up the public screaming
[2:40:53.500 --> 2:40:56.500]  bloody murder and so they're making their move against us right now this is
[2:40:56.500 --> 2:41:01.780]  yeah this is the final takeover this I don't think people realize Alex the
[2:41:01.780 --> 2:41:05.300]  full extent of it people the younger people who are just getting involved in
[2:41:05.300 --> 2:41:11.300]  awakening but you know this whole government is being operated literally
[2:41:11.300 --> 2:41:15.620]  for a private commercial enterprise of a small handful of private bankers now I
[2:41:15.620 --> 2:41:21.140]  mean look it's a tax to them they openly say now you will pay your taxes to the
[2:41:21.140 --> 2:41:24.500]  foreign banks you will pay your your carbon taxes and taxes on money
[2:41:24.500 --> 2:41:28.060]  transfers isn't enough for them to have a some of the IRS now now they're
[2:41:28.060 --> 2:41:32.980]  forcing all these other taxes to the end shut down industry to bankrupt us to get
[2:41:32.980 --> 2:41:36.580]  control of us and they brag and say that they don't want you having a job folks
[2:41:36.580 --> 2:41:40.180]  they want you totally bankrupt under the health department's control so they can
[2:41:40.180 --> 2:41:45.060]  sterilize you trillions of dollars literally trillions we don't know how
[2:41:45.060 --> 2:41:49.420]  much into the hands of these private families that attacks exempt and we need
[2:41:49.420 --> 2:41:54.660]  to call for an article one section nine clause seven audit they got to do it it's
[2:41:54.660 --> 2:41:57.460]  a constitutional audit they've never agreed but but I mean that's what's so
[2:41:57.460 --> 2:42:03.060]  outrageous about this is that openly private families own and run the
[2:42:03.060 --> 2:42:06.620]  government they're totally illegitimate they've stolen twelve point eight
[2:42:06.620 --> 2:42:11.860]  trillion in the last six months they're openly putting troops on the streets
[2:42:11.860 --> 2:42:16.140]  everywhere they're openly throwing down the gauntlet they're openly saying gun
[2:42:16.140 --> 2:42:19.500]  owners are terrorist they're openly have the Mexican government telling
[2:42:19.500 --> 2:42:24.820]  americans we have to turn our guns in I mean again it's so off the charts now
[2:42:24.820 --> 2:42:30.260]  that if we'll just go explain this to the public we can turn this around and
[2:42:30.260 --> 2:42:35.380]  take this nation back we have it we have a chance but more people have to
[2:42:35.380 --> 2:42:39.700]  activate now have to say the tea parties are the perfect thing because you got
[2:42:39.700 --> 2:42:44.620]  to remember america's two civil wars were precipitated by tax rebellions and
[2:42:44.620 --> 2:42:48.300]  states rights and gun and gun confiscation you're absolutely right I
[2:42:48.300 --> 2:42:52.300]  appreciate your call and that's why suddenly fox news goes there is a
[2:42:52.300 --> 2:42:56.140]  world government there is a global tax because they can't deny it anymore all

[2:43:34.580 --> 2:43:37.740]  we're going to just want to let you know i got uh... the film the obama
[2:43:37.740 --> 2:43:38.620]  deception
[2:43:38.620 --> 2:43:41.620]  just got that delivered and i want to say thanks for all the other stuff you
[2:43:41.620 --> 2:43:43.220]  guys throw in there
[2:43:43.220 --> 2:43:46.460]  all and i want to find out about ordering uh...
[2:43:46.460 --> 2:43:49.660]  about a thousand of these citizens rule books
[2:43:49.660 --> 2:43:51.780]  this is uh... this is pretty
[2:43:51.780 --> 2:43:53.860]  pretty interesting to hand out
[2:43:53.860 --> 2:43:57.660]  so that was one of the one that we have all the federal documents saying you
[2:43:57.660 --> 2:44:00.300]  hand out bill rights constitution declaration of independence at the police
[2:44:00.300 --> 2:44:01.460]  of sworn oath to
[2:44:01.460 --> 2:44:05.340]  they call that a terrorist document in the i'm not kidding folks the government
[2:44:05.340 --> 2:44:08.500]  calls those citizen rule books effect where's my terrorist document
[2:44:08.500 --> 2:44:11.380]  because because it shows bring me one folks
[2:44:11.380 --> 2:44:14.540]  it it shows that everything they're doing
[2:44:14.540 --> 2:44:16.100]  is illegal
[2:44:16.100 --> 2:44:19.780]  it shows that they're a pack of criminals outside the law and they're
[2:44:19.780 --> 2:44:23.380]  saying we're terrorist lawbreakers because we're pointing out that our
[2:44:23.380 --> 2:44:24.740]  country's been hijacked
[2:44:24.740 --> 2:44:26.940]  and then again the feds have got a problem
[2:44:26.940 --> 2:44:28.860]  there's hundreds of these reports out
[2:44:28.860 --> 2:44:32.060]  shang new order doesn't exist global government doesn't exist global currency
[2:44:32.060 --> 2:44:32.980]  doesn't exist
[2:44:32.980 --> 2:44:35.060]  naphthen gata been good for the economy
[2:44:35.060 --> 2:44:38.620]  you know uh... they say it's a conspiracy theory of the economy is bad
[2:44:38.620 --> 2:44:41.500]  in this latest one and you can't make this up
[2:44:41.500 --> 2:44:42.740]  it's so ridiculous
[2:44:42.740 --> 2:44:45.380]  and all these cops that are reading this are going wait a minute everything
[2:44:45.380 --> 2:44:47.260]  they're saying here came true
[2:44:47.260 --> 2:44:51.260]  so now they're saying well there is a global government there are camps
[2:44:51.260 --> 2:44:53.900]  but it's for your own good
[2:44:53.900 --> 2:44:57.660]  so yeah i think there is there are a couple of things that was are brought to
[2:44:57.660 --> 2:44:59.940]  my attention here today
[2:44:59.940 --> 2:45:02.380]  on my ron paul groups that i belong to
[2:45:02.380 --> 2:45:06.460]  uh... i got this email showing up with his keep overman
[2:45:06.460 --> 2:45:11.100]  on uh... tv and he thinks uh... did this thing here so obama moves to legalize
[2:45:11.100 --> 2:45:13.660]  warrantless wiretapping
[2:45:13.660 --> 2:45:17.460]  yeah we have played that clip uh... they are legalizing
[2:45:17.460 --> 2:45:22.340]  uh... tend to be up it will not tend maximum infinity unlimited wiretapping
[2:45:22.340 --> 2:45:25.700]  internet hobs all small even small internet company will have a federal
[2:45:25.700 --> 2:45:28.740]  hub everything will run through the government just like the telephones
[2:45:28.740 --> 2:45:29.660]  already do
[2:45:29.660 --> 2:45:32.780]  that the internet already does as well but they wanted all the regional systems
[2:45:32.780 --> 2:45:36.220]  no warrants no more fourth amendment no more nothing
[2:45:36.220 --> 2:45:38.900]  and he thought remand has been forced to admit it's true
[2:45:38.900 --> 2:45:40.180]  that's what i'm saying
[2:45:40.180 --> 2:45:42.300]  but i still have all these obama zombies
[2:45:42.300 --> 2:45:45.220]  telling me that none of this exists everything's fine
[2:45:45.220 --> 2:45:47.300]  just one thing um...
[2:45:47.300 --> 2:45:50.940]  i read i read the economist religiously which is as far as i'm concerned is
[2:45:50.940 --> 2:45:54.020]  the aristocrats rag that they read
[2:45:54.020 --> 2:45:58.180]  uh... i thought it was amazing on page sixty four this week's issue
[2:45:58.180 --> 2:46:04.860]  uh... says here says spanish firms hope to benefit from america stimulus plan
[2:46:04.860 --> 2:46:07.700]  it's going to go down here to say
[2:46:07.700 --> 2:46:11.500]  the stimulus plan is three hundred seventeen billion dollars
[2:46:11.500 --> 2:46:14.500]  of intended spending but spain is the only country
[2:46:14.500 --> 2:46:16.460]  have built a campaign around it
[2:46:16.460 --> 2:46:19.140]  and here's here's where all this stuff gets interesting is down here at the
[2:46:19.140 --> 2:46:20.100]  bottom of it
[2:46:20.100 --> 2:46:23.900]  so that the ten biggest construction spanish for spanish firms
[2:46:23.900 --> 2:46:25.540]  including ferro rival
[2:46:25.540 --> 2:46:28.100]  have pioneered public private partnerships
[2:46:28.100 --> 2:46:31.780]  in construction and operation of infrastructure in florida
[2:46:31.780 --> 2:46:32.640]  illinois
[2:46:32.640 --> 2:46:33.820]  texas
[2:46:33.820 --> 2:46:37.380]  and other states from which it already benefits from federal
[2:46:37.380 --> 2:46:38.540]  funding
[2:46:38.540 --> 2:46:45.540]  president of the state that seventy one billion dollars
[2:46:45.660 --> 2:46:48.740]  all yeah i knew what you were about to go to him
[2:46:48.740 --> 2:46:50.100]  that's what this is
[2:46:50.100 --> 2:46:51.980]  they take our tax money
[2:46:51.980 --> 2:46:55.700]  and then give it to the offshore corporations they even
[2:46:55.700 --> 2:46:59.100]  take our tax money to build factories
[2:46:59.100 --> 2:47:01.320]  uh... in other countries
[2:47:01.320 --> 2:47:04.420]  and then they have the austin chronicle right article saying alex jones is
[2:47:04.420 --> 2:47:05.740]  insane
[2:47:05.740 --> 2:47:09.020]  central is not owned by spain
[2:47:09.020 --> 2:47:12.140]  and so understand central and others
[2:47:12.140 --> 2:47:15.580]  just being given the roads to put toll roads on eight thousand miles of texas
[2:47:15.580 --> 2:47:16.940]  roads
[2:47:16.940 --> 2:47:20.060]  they're being paid to do it see
[2:47:20.060 --> 2:47:23.060]  it's like the bankers get twelve point eight trillion of our tax money
[2:47:23.060 --> 2:47:26.420]  we have to pay the interest to give them the money
[2:47:26.420 --> 2:47:29.780]  you understand you don't just give the bankers your money
[2:47:29.780 --> 2:47:33.980]  but this isn't just texas i mean this is this is talking about the corridor
[2:47:33.980 --> 2:47:36.500]  i mean it even includes illinois i mean where do you think that's going to go
[2:47:36.500 --> 2:47:37.660]  to canada
[2:47:37.660 --> 2:47:41.000]  well no no i mean that we have their official maps north american union
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:43.700]  nafta superhighways i mean i but that's what my film in game covers no i
[2:47:43.700 --> 2:47:44.740]  agree
[2:47:44.740 --> 2:47:47.060]  and yes the economist
[2:47:47.060 --> 2:47:48.740]  the financial times of london

[2:47:53.380 --> 2:47:55.520]  and one of the article in here on all
[2:47:55.520 --> 2:47:58.740]  uh... just two things in her one of the articles were bring up

[2:54:45.300 --> 2:54:48.700]  a great extent because they can't believe what's happening here's a quick
[2:54:48.700 --> 2:54:56.940]  example I'm gonna go back to your calls I decided I knew that media matters was
[2:54:56.940 --> 2:55:01.900]  owned by George Soros he was the main financier lying about me attacking me
[2:55:01.900 --> 2:55:09.700]  really engaging in in libel and slander and classical forms of defamation
[2:55:09.700 --> 2:55:14.140]  but then I looked into alternate and you know who have you go to the federal
[2:55:14.140 --> 2:55:18.900]  registered you can look it up it is foundation run Ford Foundation Rockefeller
[2:55:18.900 --> 2:55:23.180]  Foundation Soros foundations and so they're writing article after article
[2:55:23.180 --> 2:55:31.820]  saying I need to be shot off the radio and have my free speech taken you see
[2:55:31.820 --> 2:55:36.260]  why am I being attacked directly by the Ford Foundation directly by the
[2:55:36.260 --> 2:55:42.700]  Rockefeller Foundation directly by George Soros in fact I've got that in the
[2:55:42.700 --> 2:55:47.660]  stack I even printed it all off I have time near the end of the show I'll get
[2:55:47.660 --> 2:55:52.060]  into or I may do a show on it tomorrow I've got the printouts right here Ford
[2:55:52.060 --> 2:55:59.260]  Foundation alternate you can go right to the federal websites that have all the
[2:55:59.260 --> 2:56:06.020]  foundation money telling you who gets what they're doing this because they know
[2:56:06.020 --> 2:56:13.420]  we're telling the truth they know we know what they're up to and I'm glad
[2:56:13.420 --> 2:56:20.460]  they're attacking me because it lets me know I'm doing my job they have already
[2:56:20.460 --> 2:56:28.140]  engaged in irrevocable devastating terminal financial attacks on the
[2:56:28.140 --> 2:56:31.500]  country we're like a nation that's been stabbed hundreds of times we've gone
[2:56:31.500 --> 2:56:35.860]  into shock the last bloods coming out of us and we've turned white you know
[2:56:35.860 --> 2:56:39.580]  we're dying right now and they're just sitting there with pleasure all the
[2:56:39.580 --> 2:56:43.380]  American haters all the control freaks all the parasites these are just bad
[2:56:43.380 --> 2:56:46.620]  people they hate you they hate your family they hate your second amendment
[2:56:46.620 --> 2:56:50.060]  they hate your freedoms look at all the other countries they're all run by pot
[2:56:50.060 --> 2:56:54.140]  belly scum that loves Lord around in fancy outfits with giant frongs of
[2:56:54.140 --> 2:56:58.780]  starving people outside their palaces that's their tool of control they enjoy

[2:57:06.520 --> 2:57:14.420]  evil and they control the left and the right and until we wake up to them and
[2:57:14.420 --> 2:57:21.420]  say no it's only gonna get worse now they're scared now though you see they've
[2:57:21.420 --> 2:57:25.180]  gone past the point of return they've made the decision to go after the guns
[2:57:25.180 --> 2:57:28.800]  and start shootouts with the police it'll go into martial law and have the
[2:57:28.800 --> 2:57:32.020]  economic displacement and break down and use the collapse of Mexico to ban
[2:57:32.020 --> 2:57:36.340]  guns here and they're now announcing it and a lot of their minions and servants
[2:57:36.340 --> 2:57:39.220]  are starting to figure out we told them the truth and that this is real and that
[2:57:39.220 --> 2:57:42.220]  and so they're getting a little concerned now and so they're starting to blow
[2:57:42.220 --> 2:57:47.260]  the whistle and the establishments moved offshore because they know they're
[2:57:47.260 --> 2:57:51.580]  gonna plan kind of a Soviet culling the great harvest as they call it the mass
[2:57:51.580 --> 2:57:58.700]  murder but because we warned people before it happened by them making this
[2:57:58.700 --> 2:58:02.260]  move and trying this we're going to feed them because they've gone past the
[2:58:02.260 --> 2:58:06.620]  point of incrementalism they can't incrementally creep around and do this
[2:58:06.620 --> 2:58:11.020]  anymore they've now thrown down the gauntlet they've now put it in high gear
[2:58:11.020 --> 2:58:18.900]  they're going to ride up against humanity and so the battle is joined
[2:58:18.900 --> 2:58:24.220]  ladies and gentlemen I wish every day this wasn't real I wish every day they
[2:58:24.220 --> 2:58:26.980]  weren't shipping bird flu all over the world shooting people up whether they're
[2:58:26.980 --> 2:58:30.140]  dying that's mainstream news but none nobody in the quote alternative

[3:03:58.900 --> 3:04:01.940]  you know meanwhile we've got it all admitted right out in the open
[3:04:01.940 --> 3:04:05.500]  going on instead the media is going to look at that it in anyone who knows
[3:04:05.500 --> 3:04:09.340]  how operations worker anything to think we're a bunch of idiots
[3:04:09.340 --> 3:04:12.100]  okay just like the media all over the country's going out and saying these are
[3:04:12.100 --> 3:04:14.820]  just graves being expanded
[3:04:14.820 --> 3:04:16.940]  at the a cemetery
[3:04:16.940 --> 3:04:21.700]  it's sad but true a lot of our veterans are passing now
[3:04:21.700 --> 3:04:25.300]  instead of going by the way this cemetery sign an agreement to be ready to
[3:04:25.300 --> 3:04:26.940]  bury a hundred thousand americans
[3:04:26.940 --> 3:04:30.460]  they're in a bio attack see they don't tell you the other part
[3:04:30.460 --> 3:04:33.580]  and so they strong manage and they're able to do that because
[3:04:33.580 --> 3:04:36.420]  layman the general public are now getting involved with reporters which is
[3:04:36.420 --> 3:04:37.540]  great

[3:08:33.660 --> 3:08:36.140]  to discover alleged wrongdoing in the establishment
[3:08:36.140 --> 3:08:41.260]  administration enforcement of the federal income tax and then confront his
[3:08:41.260 --> 3:08:45.100]  superiors and top officials in the irs about these allegations
[3:08:45.100 --> 3:08:48.380]  and his belief that taxpayer rights were being violated
[3:08:48.380 --> 3:08:51.260]  after confronting the iris officials with the results contained in the
[3:08:51.260 --> 3:08:54.940]  investigative report his inquiries were similarly rebuffed and he was
[3:08:54.940 --> 3:08:57.660]  encouraged to resign he resigned on february 25th
[3:08:57.660 --> 3:09:00.460]  1999 i interviewed him right after that happened
[3:09:00.460 --> 3:09:04.380]  he were the first people to interview him because i got a tip that this was
[3:09:04.380 --> 3:09:07.660]  happening i happened to be out in california for urban warrior
[3:09:07.660 --> 3:09:10.700]  where they were trained to confiscate americans guns with the military
[3:09:10.700 --> 3:09:15.500]  all of video and so that's why we got the interview first put on local tv and
[3:09:15.500 --> 3:09:19.180]  austin and on the web and it's in the film i made comprehensive animal
[3:09:19.180 --> 3:09:22.460]  financial reports exposed i'm proud of the fact that we brought
[3:09:22.460 --> 3:09:26.940]  mr bannister out first mr bannister is a graduate of san joseph state
[3:09:26.940 --> 3:09:30.780]  university he became a licensed certified public accountant
[3:09:30.780 --> 3:09:34.380]  that goes on from there he left the practice of public accounting in 93 to
[3:09:34.380 --> 3:09:37.260]  accept appointment to the u.s department of treasury iris criminal
[3:09:37.260 --> 3:09:40.620]  investigation division as a special agent in addition to his investigative
[3:09:40.620 --> 3:09:44.060]  duties as a sworn federal law enforcement officer mr bannister was
[3:09:44.060 --> 3:09:48.220]  organized crime drug enforcement task officer and assisted forfeiture

[3:09:55.740 --> 3:09:58.780]  since leaving the iris mr bannister has worked closely with bob shoals
[3:09:58.780 --> 3:10:01.980]  with the people foundation to preserve our elected representatives to
[3:10:01.980 --> 3:10:05.660]  investigate and uh... correct of the deceitful
[3:10:05.660 --> 3:10:09.580]  and often destructive tactics used by the agency against innocent hardworking
[3:10:09.580 --> 3:10:13.180]  americans and they tried to then arrest him and indict him
[3:10:13.180 --> 3:10:16.620]  for telling people the iris was a scam and he beat them in court on that with a
[3:10:16.620 --> 3:10:19.980]  jury so just an amazing individual been through hell on earth
[3:10:19.980 --> 3:10:24.140]  and it all started in 97 two years before he went public
[3:10:24.140 --> 3:10:29.660]  he heard bv kid on mainstream radio explaining that the iris was for private
[3:10:29.660 --> 3:10:34.060]  banks and net anyway spent two years researching it just to recap
[3:10:34.060 --> 3:10:37.580]  for folks that don't know who he is found out it was real went and talked to
[3:10:37.580 --> 3:10:40.460]  the superiors they said you need to just resign get out of here
[3:10:40.460 --> 3:10:45.100]  we don't want to hear about that now it's public that private banks own the
[3:10:45.100 --> 3:10:48.380]  world government bank of the world's being set up you'll pay your carbon
[3:10:48.380 --> 3:10:52.460]  taxes to him uh... there's just no end to it
[3:10:52.460 --> 3:10:56.220]  and so it's gonna get worse and worse and in the mic report
[3:10:56.220 --> 3:11:00.140]  in this report uh... by the virginia terrorism threat assessment
[3:11:00.140 --> 3:11:03.580]  they mentioned joe banister on some of these reports they mentioned
[3:11:03.580 --> 3:11:06.780]  uh... you know people going out and talking about the iris
[3:11:06.780 --> 3:11:09.660]  they mentioned that with the we the people group
[3:11:09.660 --> 3:11:13.660]  they mentioned mainline libertarians look as an american you get involved in
[3:11:13.660 --> 3:11:15.580]  say i don't want to live under tyranny
[3:11:15.580 --> 3:11:19.900]  they say you're a terrorist and now the new document that's out
[3:11:19.900 --> 3:11:23.340]  is saying gun owners are terrorist period and that they are coming for our
[3:11:23.340 --> 3:11:24.460]  guns so
[3:11:24.460 --> 3:11:28.060]  this is a road government folks and where i mean this is out of control
[3:11:28.060 --> 3:11:31.180]  uh... so i got joe on uh... today with us joe great to have you back up by
[3:11:31.180 --> 3:11:32.460]  with us
[3:11:32.460 --> 3:11:35.740]  thanks alex that's great uh... great to hear your voice
[3:11:35.740 --> 3:11:39.260]  so much is going on so much is happening uh...
[3:11:39.260 --> 3:11:41.900]  when you first woke up to the new world order many years ago did you ever think
[3:11:41.900 --> 3:11:43.180]  it would get this crazy
[3:11:43.180 --> 3:11:48.540]  this fast i mean i can't believe how ridiculously corrupt the government is
[3:11:48.540 --> 3:11:52.780]  uh... well i mean uh... as it has become more and more apparent at the race to
[3:11:52.780 --> 3:11:56.300]  the finish line you were just saying that earlier in your show and you say it
[3:11:56.300 --> 3:11:59.980]  every day thankfully because we need people need to keep hearing it
[3:11:59.980 --> 3:12:01.180]  uh...
[3:12:01.180 --> 3:12:04.860]  it's an absolute race to the finish line because they know that the people are
[3:12:04.860 --> 3:12:06.140]  waking up
[3:12:06.140 --> 3:12:09.740]  uh... that the people that they thought they trusted are uh... you know putting
[3:12:09.740 --> 3:12:13.420]  a noose around their neck and sending them to the the gallows
[3:12:13.420 --> 3:12:16.300]  and that's the people that we pay to serve us
[3:12:16.300 --> 3:12:18.860]  are are actually scheming to
[3:12:18.860 --> 3:12:20.380]  destroy us
[3:12:20.380 --> 3:12:25.260]  and um... i remember thinking when i was in my late teens i uh... was
[3:12:25.260 --> 3:12:27.260]  i became aware of the
[3:12:27.260 --> 3:12:31.660]  attacks against the second amendment and uh... the efforts to protect it
[3:12:31.660 --> 3:12:35.580]  and then i thought well how can the government be so blatant uh... in their
[3:12:35.580 --> 3:12:37.820]  attacks against the second amendment
[3:12:37.820 --> 3:12:40.860]  and then in my thirties i learned about the income tax
[3:12:40.860 --> 3:12:45.420]  and right realized that while the federal government been bsing people
[3:12:45.420 --> 3:12:47.420]  you know since the early nineteen hundred
[3:12:47.420 --> 3:12:50.940]  so of course they think they can go after the second amendment
[3:12:50.940 --> 3:12:55.100]  and uh... course now in my forties uh... learning more about you know
[3:12:55.100 --> 3:12:58.460]  the bigger picture as you uh... so eloquently
[3:12:58.460 --> 3:12:59.980]  shown to people
[3:12:59.980 --> 3:13:03.900]  uh... it's just you know that tip of the iceberg just you get to see just how
[3:13:03.900 --> 3:13:07.580]  big that iceberg is under the surface
[3:13:07.580 --> 3:13:11.740]  joe i agree with you i mean i i i am dumbstruck i am amazed i had a caller
[3:13:11.740 --> 3:13:14.860]  call in and mention the economist magazine i wasn't aware of that article
[3:13:14.860 --> 3:13:17.420]  but i'm covering here i know it's true
[3:13:17.420 --> 3:13:19.340]  where they pay
[3:13:19.340 --> 3:13:22.700]  foreign companies german dot spanish
[3:13:22.700 --> 3:13:25.500]  to come seize the roads and put toll roads on them
[3:13:25.500 --> 3:13:27.580]  i mean these bankers are so arrogant
[3:13:27.580 --> 3:13:30.340]  then they're even bankers it's just mafia scammers
[3:13:30.340 --> 3:13:34.380]  that they get paid to grab the roads and taxes
[3:13:34.380 --> 3:13:36.860]  and they're just stealing everything
[3:13:36.860 --> 3:13:40.700]  uh... they admittedly are breaking all the laws stealing trillions for
[3:13:40.700 --> 3:13:43.260]  themselves right now with the bailout money
[3:13:43.260 --> 3:13:47.500]  uh... and and and i can have former top federal regulators on
[3:13:47.500 --> 3:13:49.180]  like a professor we had on
[3:13:49.180 --> 3:13:52.900]  who put the s n l folks in prison he admits the whole government's criminal
[3:13:52.900 --> 3:13:55.980]  they're taking over i mean
[3:13:55.980 --> 3:13:58.580]  i guess that's the good news though joe is that
[3:13:58.580 --> 3:14:02.060]  is that now people really can admit to themselves
[3:14:02.060 --> 3:14:04.100]  that we are
[3:14:04.100 --> 3:14:07.300]  totally dominated by a mafia but the mafia doesn't care
[3:14:07.300 --> 3:14:10.220]  and and like you said is racing to the finish line
[3:14:10.220 --> 3:14:13.100]  where do you see this going
[3:14:13.100 --> 3:14:13.980]  well
[3:14:13.980 --> 3:14:15.060]  it's going to get
[3:14:15.060 --> 3:14:19.020]  worse than to you know the two tyrants always turn to
[3:14:19.020 --> 3:14:24.260]  violence right i mean uh... the people is is when our country was founded
[3:14:24.260 --> 3:14:26.180]  there's plenty of evidence of
[3:14:26.180 --> 3:14:29.140]  uh... non-violent uh... petitioning
[3:14:29.140 --> 3:14:30.780]  seeking redress
[3:14:30.780 --> 3:14:31.780]  and uh...
[3:14:31.780 --> 3:14:37.300]  how does it end up the british try to steal the guns of the the colonists
[3:14:37.300 --> 3:14:39.180]  and uh... the war is on
[3:14:39.180 --> 3:14:41.780]  um... so and i you know i listen to your show a lot
[3:14:41.780 --> 3:14:45.740]  uh... i even learned that you wanted to have me on the show for my son ryan
[3:14:45.740 --> 3:14:47.380]  seventeen-year-old
[3:14:47.380 --> 3:14:48.340]  uh...
[3:14:48.340 --> 3:14:52.700]  so the good news also is that young people uh... are dialed in to what's
[3:14:52.700 --> 3:14:54.820]  going on thanks to you
[3:14:54.820 --> 3:14:57.300]  uh... by listening to your show regularly
[3:14:57.300 --> 3:15:01.940]  uh... but i unfortunately i think history is shown that tyrants always
[3:15:01.940 --> 3:15:03.540]  go to
[3:15:03.540 --> 3:15:07.100]  to violence uh... they also use the uh...
[3:15:07.100 --> 3:15:10.820]  your surreptitious means like i've seen on your website as far as
[3:15:10.820 --> 3:15:12.220]  infiltration
[3:15:12.220 --> 3:15:15.060]  uh... co-opting of of our efforts
[3:15:15.060 --> 3:15:19.140]  and that's okay i mean we you know again thanks to you uh... we know a lot of
[3:15:19.140 --> 3:15:22.100]  their tactics and we can be prepared for them
[3:15:22.100 --> 3:15:26.500]  um... i think what we have to do is just look at people's conduct
[3:15:26.500 --> 3:15:31.460]  uh... and you know yours you're so well uh... document people's conduct and i
[3:15:31.460 --> 3:15:34.540]  think that you know people who are searching for
[3:15:34.540 --> 3:15:38.540]  uh... were to turn uh... for for information
[3:15:38.540 --> 3:15:40.060]  uh... for leadership
[3:15:40.060 --> 3:15:44.940]  just look at the conduct of the people and look back five years ten years
[3:15:44.940 --> 3:15:48.300]  fifteen years into their conduct which is you know why you're
[3:15:48.300 --> 3:15:50.980]  when you can talk about someone like one back
[3:15:50.980 --> 3:15:53.340]  um... look at their path
[3:15:53.340 --> 3:15:56.940]  and if you see something that doesn't look right uh... you know
[3:15:56.940 --> 3:16:01.060]  you better get a catch yourself and then maybe not be so you know still learn
[3:16:01.060 --> 3:16:02.220]  from them but
[3:16:02.220 --> 3:16:06.100]  be careful not to to follow them and they may follow you you might fall in
[3:16:06.100 --> 3:16:07.340]  right over cliff
[3:16:07.340 --> 3:16:10.140]  that's right you gotta judge a tree by its fruits and then look i hate attacking
[3:16:10.140 --> 3:16:11.340]  back all day and i
[3:16:11.340 --> 3:16:15.940]  i get me a soft mark about it's just that it's so obvious
[3:16:15.940 --> 3:16:18.180]  what a fruity is in others
[3:16:18.180 --> 3:16:21.980]  and i just am tired of seeing people get taken for a ride i i i because i'm not
[3:16:21.980 --> 3:16:23.220]  that smart joe
[3:16:23.220 --> 3:16:26.580]  i've just been doing this for now fourteen plus years and
[3:16:26.580 --> 3:16:28.260]  doing it full time
[3:16:28.260 --> 3:16:30.580]  you know with the candle at both ends
[3:16:30.580 --> 3:16:34.060]  and so i've learned all the silly little tricks they try doesn't mean i'm
[3:16:34.060 --> 3:16:37.780]  good articulating it as a lot of other people smarter than i am
[3:16:37.780 --> 3:16:38.980]  uh... it's just
[3:16:38.980 --> 3:16:41.420]  again i just get dumbfounded by
[3:16:41.420 --> 3:16:45.340]  how gullible people are but like you said it's a process we were all wants
[3:16:45.340 --> 3:16:46.780]  ignorant
[3:16:46.780 --> 3:16:48.400]  about how things work
[3:16:48.400 --> 3:16:52.220]  and uh... i agree with you the system is really getting aware of the awakening
[3:16:52.220 --> 3:16:54.060]  right now and
[3:16:54.060 --> 3:16:57.180]  joe joe uh... i don't see any way they're going to get through what they're
[3:16:57.180 --> 3:17:01.420]  doing without starting a big war staging some big terror attacks
[3:17:01.420 --> 3:17:03.940]  uh... really doing some horrible stuff
[3:17:03.940 --> 3:17:05.380]  and uh...
[3:17:05.380 --> 3:17:08.780]  that's why you know i i tell people this isn't a game
[3:17:08.780 --> 3:17:12.460]  and i think i i i i i hear my rebroadcast sometimes where i'm screwing
[3:17:12.460 --> 3:17:14.860]  around having fun because i'm just a regular guy too
[3:17:14.860 --> 3:17:17.620]  and i get mad at myself and i go you can't do that
[3:17:17.620 --> 3:17:19.900]  this isn't a game you know i
[3:17:19.900 --> 3:17:20.940]  it hits me
[3:17:20.940 --> 3:17:23.540]  how real this is and i'm sure it's hit you
[3:17:23.540 --> 3:17:27.980]  when they try to put you in prison for telling people the irs was a scam
[3:17:27.980 --> 3:17:29.300]  uh... yeah well
[3:17:29.300 --> 3:17:31.940]  as we've as we found uh... you know
[3:17:31.940 --> 3:17:36.300]  different footage of you uh... getting arrested sometimes you expect expected
[3:17:36.300 --> 3:17:38.260]  to be in other times not
[3:17:38.260 --> 3:17:42.020]  uh... you know they have the jail they've got the legions of lawyers and and
[3:17:42.020 --> 3:17:43.780]  the pockets and and
[3:17:43.780 --> 3:17:45.340]  but we have the truth
[3:17:45.340 --> 3:17:48.700]  and uh... i think that we you know i i'm sure it
[3:17:48.700 --> 3:17:50.140]  uh... like me
[3:17:50.140 --> 3:17:53.740]  uh... we don't do this in a vacuum uh... we look for uh...
[3:17:53.740 --> 3:17:56.020]  spiritual strength uh... we rely on
[3:17:56.020 --> 3:17:57.500]  on our
[3:17:57.500 --> 3:18:01.900]  almighty father to uh... to guide us to inspire us to
[3:18:01.900 --> 3:18:03.700]  uh... figure out how we're gonna
[3:18:03.700 --> 3:18:08.620]  beat this back uh... because the truth uh... will ultimately win in the end
[3:18:08.620 --> 3:18:09.620]  uh...
[3:18:09.620 --> 3:18:14.220]  i frankly you know in my opinion uh... the country of course started out with
[3:18:14.220 --> 3:18:18.820]  uh... many uh... blessings and continued for many hundreds of years
[3:18:18.820 --> 3:18:20.860]  but those blessings uh...
[3:18:20.860 --> 3:18:24.740]  team at least the results of what we see in front of us the evil that's out
[3:18:24.740 --> 3:18:25.580]  there
[3:18:25.580 --> 3:18:27.980]  we need to get back to where god is
[3:18:27.980 --> 3:18:31.100]  bestowing the abundant blessings on our country
[3:18:31.100 --> 3:18:33.820]  and maybe we need to look to see it look to ourselves
[3:18:33.820 --> 3:18:37.060]  uh... look to as i think i've heard you mention about uh... the abortion that
[3:18:37.060 --> 3:18:38.700]  goes on in this country
[3:18:38.700 --> 3:18:41.420]  uh... the killing the the poisoning
[3:18:41.420 --> 3:18:42.860]  uh... those are all evil
[3:18:42.860 --> 3:18:44.620]  things that are occurring
[3:18:44.620 --> 3:18:46.140]  and we need uh...
[3:18:46.140 --> 3:18:51.020]  almighty god blessing absolutely in fact i mean i mean folks you you you
[3:18:51.020 --> 3:18:53.420]  report yourself
[3:18:53.420 --> 3:18:56.940]  people think they can just kill babies as a form of birth control and that fifty
[3:18:56.940 --> 3:18:57.780]  dead
[3:18:57.780 --> 3:18:59.900]  and fifty million dead babies
[3:18:59.900 --> 3:19:01.500]  won't come back on you
[3:19:01.500 --> 3:19:05.700]  in a society that doesn't care about babies or old people
[3:19:05.700 --> 3:19:09.100]  other folks you folks are going to care about you
[3:19:09.100 --> 3:19:12.160]  and yes the reason we're going to hell in a hand basket
[3:19:12.160 --> 3:19:15.340]  is because we have decided evil is cool
[3:19:15.340 --> 3:19:17.980]  killing babies is fine and all this is fine
[3:19:17.980 --> 3:19:21.580]  and so folks now we're going to go into something like Stalin is russia
[3:19:21.580 --> 3:19:24.140]  and i don't just say that for a fact
[3:19:24.140 --> 3:19:27.020]  uh... i want us to understand and joe's experienced it
[3:19:27.020 --> 3:19:30.220]  that we have the establishment that's in control
[3:19:30.220 --> 3:19:32.500]  is just as bad as stalinist
[3:19:32.500 --> 3:19:34.860]  communist
[3:19:34.860 --> 3:19:36.460]  absolutely

[3:25:01.300 --> 3:25:04.100]  federal security guards little nazi outfits come over and say we're gonna
[3:25:04.100 --> 3:25:06.580]  arrest you if you don't tell us who you are and then leave
[3:25:06.580 --> 3:25:09.860]  yeah it's just it's just this isn't freedom
[3:25:09.860 --> 3:25:14.260]  what what's the process with the police and military right now
[3:25:14.260 --> 3:25:18.820]  uh with these reports a are they buying them
[3:25:18.820 --> 3:25:23.380]  and then b how do they deal with the report saying there's no such thing as
[3:25:23.380 --> 3:25:26.980]  a new world order global government the conspiracy theorist terrorist
[3:25:26.980 --> 3:25:29.540]  believe they're going to set up a bank of the world
[3:25:29.540 --> 3:25:32.500]  and then meanwhile that's being announced all over the news that it is
[3:25:32.500 --> 3:25:35.780]  happening i mean how do police and military deal with the
[3:25:35.780 --> 3:25:40.020]  doublespeak well uh as i'm sure you're aware alec
[3:25:40.020 --> 3:25:43.860]  there's a hierarchy in most law enforcement agencies right you got the
[3:25:43.860 --> 3:25:47.620]  people at the top who are large you know i shouldn't
[3:25:47.620 --> 3:25:50.740]  be broad brushing but i mean largely bought and paid for
[3:25:50.740 --> 3:25:54.980]  then you have the rank and file people who live regular lives like you and me
[3:25:54.980 --> 3:25:59.060]  and uh what these what the ivory tower um hierarchy
[3:25:59.060 --> 3:26:02.980]  wants is that the rank and file will just read these
[3:26:02.980 --> 3:26:06.740]  memos these pamphlets these training manuals
[3:26:06.740 --> 3:26:10.500]  and that's their only that's their only source of information
[3:26:10.500 --> 3:26:15.620]  and that's i think what the uh hierarchy wants and is what they expect
[3:26:15.620 --> 3:26:19.380]  but fortunately with the internet and because there are still plenty of rank
[3:26:19.380 --> 3:26:22.580]  and file people that have brains and use them
[3:26:22.580 --> 3:26:26.100]  uh they go out and they find other information or their friends and
[3:26:26.100 --> 3:26:29.620]  relatives and neighbors share information with them
[3:26:29.620 --> 3:26:33.940]  and they just use their own uh you know god-given cognitive skills to say
[3:26:33.940 --> 3:26:38.020]  wait a second um somebody's lying to me and that's
[3:26:38.020 --> 3:26:42.500]  exactly what happened to me um fortunately for me i had a
[3:26:42.500 --> 3:26:47.300]  number of years outside the irs uh before i went in there
[3:26:47.300 --> 3:26:50.500]  so when i went in there it was such a culture shock
[3:26:50.500 --> 3:26:53.780]  unlike people that might you know graduate from college and go right into
[3:26:53.780 --> 3:26:57.860]  the irs and spend a career there so i had a perspective
[3:26:57.860 --> 3:27:01.220]  just because i was out in the real world uh you know
[3:27:01.220 --> 3:27:05.620]  researching tax law uh dealing with clients who were having
[3:27:05.620 --> 3:27:09.540]  you know tax struggles or finding that the irs was absolutely
[3:27:09.540 --> 3:27:14.100]  destroying them for no good reason i mean when i when i first got my job at
[3:27:14.100 --> 3:27:16.820]  the irs part of my background investigation
[3:27:16.820 --> 3:27:19.940]  was an audit they audited me for three years
[3:27:19.940 --> 3:27:23.300]  and the auditor actually tried to accuse me
[3:27:23.300 --> 3:27:27.780]  of uh cheating on about ten thousand dollars worth of tax
[3:27:27.780 --> 3:27:30.660]  so i had to put my thinking cap on and fight
[3:27:30.660 --> 3:27:35.060]  an irs auditor just for my to get a job with the irs
[3:27:35.060 --> 3:27:38.420]  and i ended up getting a thousand dollar refund because i found out i was even
[3:27:38.420 --> 3:27:42.260]  too conservative but that you know they told me before the audit
[3:27:42.260 --> 3:27:45.140]  that they're going to treat you just like they do every other taxpayer and boy
[3:27:45.140 --> 3:27:49.700]  they sure did they wanted me off but i mean that's not the case now
[3:27:49.700 --> 3:27:53.380]  geithner was told you got to pay back this hundred something found he says no
[3:27:53.380 --> 3:27:57.140]  i'm not going to do it and then for the now they have a treasury secretary who
[3:27:57.140 --> 3:28:00.900]  doesn't pay taxes and it's come out that most of obama's administration
[3:28:00.900 --> 3:28:04.580]  just doesn't bother to pay and that under the last few ministrations they've
[3:28:04.580 --> 3:28:08.100]  gotten rid of most the irs enforcers against big international
[3:28:08.100 --> 3:28:11.220]  corporations where all the money's at and that's and that they're
[3:28:11.220 --> 3:28:16.020]  they're pointing them at blue collar people i guess just to waste their time
[3:28:16.020 --> 3:28:19.620]  uh... sure to make you chase your tail and uh... they know that they can
[3:28:19.620 --> 3:28:24.260]  make the average person's life miserable uh... but as you're well aware and have
[3:28:24.260 --> 3:28:26.740]  said many times uh... you know isn't that what
[3:28:26.740 --> 3:28:29.940]  socialism and communism and all these collectivists
[3:28:29.940 --> 3:28:34.100]  um... political systems are about it's about double standards
[3:28:34.100 --> 3:28:38.020]  right yes the people they they get they get into power claiming that we're going
[3:28:38.020 --> 3:28:40.420]  to make everything equal and everybody happy
[3:28:40.420 --> 3:28:44.100]  and then as soon as they're in power they don't they don't walk the walk they
[3:28:44.100 --> 3:28:47.620]  don't uh... live the right of the way everyone else lives and that's the lie
[3:28:47.620 --> 3:28:51.140]  that you know you you are so good at telling people and god bless you for
[3:28:51.140 --> 3:28:55.300]  doing it well i'm not that good at that job but i mean it
[3:28:55.300 --> 3:28:58.500]  what i'm not good at is controlling myself though i mean i'm getting sick of
[3:28:58.500 --> 3:29:01.380]  these people and i don't know for me alex
[3:29:01.380 --> 3:29:05.220]  you i mean i just love listening to you you get
[3:29:05.220 --> 3:29:09.220]  you know you get people's heart pounding and you know darn it i think uh...

[3:29:13.220 --> 3:29:17.940]  and i think i i can tell you're sincere and i think most people can tell that
[3:29:17.940 --> 3:29:22.420]  you can tell when someone's sincere you're sincerely upset you're sincerely
[3:29:22.420 --> 3:29:27.460]  worried about your fellow man and so am i and that's why we do what we do

[3:35:49.220 --> 3:35:52.420]  the IRS and their bag of dirty tricks you know what kind of dirty tricks they
[3:35:52.420 --> 3:35:57.140]  pull out to people hey when you when you beat them when they
[3:35:57.140 --> 3:36:00.260]  arrested you or indicted you for telling people about the
[3:36:00.260 --> 3:36:06.100]  fraud uh and it went to trial can you just briefly recap uh what happened
[3:36:06.100 --> 3:36:10.900]  there and then and then what they did when you beat them
[3:36:10.900 --> 3:36:15.300]  uh well uh they started investigating me i resigned in 99 they started
[3:36:15.300 --> 3:36:18.580]  investigating me and criminally in 2001
[3:36:18.580 --> 3:36:22.580]  november of 2004 i was indicted and arrested by
[3:36:22.580 --> 3:36:26.260]  you know agents i used to work with uh two hour
[3:36:26.260 --> 3:36:30.580]  um car ride up to sacramento to the u.s marshals walk up
[3:36:30.580 --> 3:36:35.860]  um did they put you in handcuffs uh they cut me they cut me in the front and gave
[3:36:35.860 --> 3:36:39.220]  me some water they were uh real kind to me what did they say hey joe we're here
[3:36:39.220 --> 3:36:42.580]  to arrest you you've been talking you're not allowed to do that america
[3:36:42.580 --> 3:36:46.660]  yeah well they i mean they came into my house with guns drawn and uh you know
[3:36:46.660 --> 3:36:50.660]  my my attitude which is so funny when they put my name in these reports and
[3:36:50.660 --> 3:36:53.780]  things uh i just i kind of thought of it like a
[3:36:53.780 --> 3:36:57.380]  training exercise uh i i laughed because when i was at the irs
[3:36:57.380 --> 3:36:59.620]  alex you know as i said i was at least a second
[3:36:59.620 --> 3:37:04.500]  amendment supporter i was aware of that and so i had bumper stickers in my
[3:37:04.500 --> 3:37:08.420]  cubicle that said you know fear the government that fears your guns and
[3:37:08.420 --> 3:37:12.660]  the experts agree gun control works with the pictures of stalin and mal
[3:37:12.660 --> 3:37:16.020]  and so whenever we'd have training exercises they'd make me the tax
[3:37:16.020 --> 3:37:19.060]  protester
[3:37:19.060 --> 3:37:21.860]  and i would get hit i would get hit with the soap pellets
[3:37:21.860 --> 3:37:25.380]  so um when they did when they came to arrest me i really just kind of
[3:37:25.380 --> 3:37:28.180]  pictured myself in another training exercise
[3:37:28.180 --> 3:37:32.900]  i showed my hands uh you know i i knew the drill because i trained it many
[3:37:32.900 --> 3:37:37.220]  times and off i went but um prosecutor tried to keep me in
[3:37:37.220 --> 3:37:40.740]  jail saying that i was a flight risk and the judge looked at him like he was a
[3:37:40.740 --> 3:37:45.460]  nut because there was no evidence that i was so the judge released me and i had
[3:37:45.460 --> 3:37:50.180]  about seven months to prepare for my trial which was in june of 2005
[3:37:50.180 --> 3:37:54.900]  i was charged with uh conspiring to defraud the united states of america
[3:37:54.900 --> 3:37:59.540]  and for preparing three false amended tax returns
[3:37:59.540 --> 3:38:04.500]  uh they didn't address my personal situation whatsoever they were trying
[3:38:04.500 --> 3:38:10.660]  to explain me to a client and claimed that our efforts to get a refund
[3:38:10.660 --> 3:38:16.260]  from the irs was a conspiracy and involved false tax returns now
[3:38:16.260 --> 3:38:22.180]  the thing is that the irs lays out what it claims is the correct way
[3:38:22.180 --> 3:38:26.260]  to do things with them and that is to pay the tax first
[3:38:26.260 --> 3:38:30.500]  and sue for a refund well we went chapter and verse
[3:38:30.500 --> 3:38:36.900]  in exactly what they lay out to to sue for a refund and that's what myself and
[3:38:36.900 --> 3:38:40.900]  my client were prosecuted for to conspire against the united states for
[3:38:40.900 --> 3:38:44.500]  following the irs's rule book and seeking a refund
[3:38:44.500 --> 3:38:48.180]  and the jury they're in sacramento california i i learned
[3:38:48.180 --> 3:38:51.540]  talking to them after i was acquitted uh they were just
[3:38:51.540 --> 3:38:55.700]  astounded that this case was even brought against me
[3:38:55.700 --> 3:39:00.340]  because all of the evidence kept showing what a
[3:39:00.340 --> 3:39:05.540]  a good guy i was i mean what a good cpa i was i was going about for my client
[3:39:05.540 --> 3:39:08.980]  everything that i submitted was right out of their own manuals right out of
[3:39:08.980 --> 3:39:12.100]  the regulations right out of the statute
[3:39:12.100 --> 3:39:16.740]  and uh they said well joe what why why did they bring up so much evidence
[3:39:16.740 --> 3:39:19.700]  that made you look so good i said well most of their evidence
[3:39:19.700 --> 3:39:24.100]  their documentary evidence came from me because they issued me a grand jury
[3:39:24.100 --> 3:39:27.540]  subpoena and uh a cpa does not have fifth
[3:39:27.540 --> 3:39:31.060]  amendment protection in their work in their work papers
[3:39:31.060 --> 3:39:36.180]  so i had to give them these stacks of work papers from my my efforts and that's
[3:39:36.180 --> 3:39:40.660]  what they used in the trial they also used a two hour video which is probably
[3:39:40.660 --> 3:39:45.380]  on the internet uh where i spoke to um the employees of my
[3:39:45.380 --> 3:39:48.740]  client's business and i just went through a two hour
[3:39:48.740 --> 3:39:54.500]  litany of what the reason that i left the irs and what i learned
[3:39:54.500 --> 3:39:58.500]  and the government used that tape in the trial
[3:39:58.500 --> 3:40:02.900]  and i guess because they were they were so devoid of anything
[3:40:02.900 --> 3:40:07.140]  you know any any any evidence they were trying to convince the jury that this
[3:40:07.140 --> 3:40:11.940]  video showed me in the act and the jury wanted to see the
[3:40:11.940 --> 3:40:15.220]  video a second time during deliberations because
[3:40:15.220 --> 3:40:19.060]  they could see that i was sincere i was
[3:40:19.060 --> 3:40:23.060]  at you know i was looking at actual documents i mean i there was just no
[3:40:23.060 --> 3:40:26.660]  bs about my presentation well for those that don't know
[3:40:26.660 --> 3:40:29.300]  they've written the income tax code and correct me if i'm wrong but
[3:40:29.300 --> 3:40:32.500]  interviewing you and other experts where the big banks and offshore
[3:40:32.500 --> 3:40:35.700]  corporations get out of paying it so there's loopholes in there for them
[3:40:35.700 --> 3:40:39.140]  it's it's all paid in the irs to go on interest to the debt of the private
[3:40:39.140 --> 3:40:43.220]  bankers we didn't have it till 1913 it was only about one percent
[3:40:43.220 --> 3:40:47.220]  until the fifties we built this country without it
[3:40:47.220 --> 3:40:53.300]  now it's the parasite dragging us down uh and uh as the public begins to learn
[3:40:53.300 --> 3:40:56.260]  about this what are they going to do but
[3:40:56.260 --> 3:41:01.700]  sorry go ahead jim uh well yeah i mean it is the the parasite i mean
[3:41:01.700 --> 3:41:07.300]  interestingly uh there's a website called here liberty.com like h-e-a-r
[3:41:07.300 --> 3:41:11.380]  and there's a t colman andrew's interview uh that u.s news and world
[3:41:11.380 --> 3:41:17.460]  report did in 1956 and mr andrews was a former irs commissioner and you
[3:41:17.460 --> 3:41:21.700]  should read how he lambat lamb based the very agency
[3:41:21.700 --> 3:41:24.580]  that he was commissioner of and the income tax
[3:41:24.580 --> 3:41:28.500]  uh you know at least back in the fifties there were still people that were in
[3:41:28.500 --> 3:41:32.020]  government that recognize communism when they saw it
[3:41:32.020 --> 3:41:37.940]  um so yeah it's like the the chameleon keeps changing its spots
[3:41:37.940 --> 3:41:41.700]  they're changing its colors but they can't change them fast enough you know
[3:41:41.700 --> 3:41:45.540]  the american people are catching on well look at what government's doing now
[3:41:45.540 --> 3:41:49.380]  it's openly being run by private banks who are literally
[3:41:49.380 --> 3:41:54.980]  stolen 12.8 trillion just the number is almost the gdp 13
[3:41:54.980 --> 3:42:00.260]  trillions the gdp and they're saying obama says i'm cutting government in
[3:42:00.260 --> 3:42:04.180]  half bush tripled it he's going to more than double
[3:42:04.180 --> 3:42:10.500]  it in one year uh the i mean just the level of
[3:42:10.500 --> 3:42:15.620]  lying i mean folks would think that i couldn't be amazed anymore by the lying
[3:42:15.620 --> 3:42:18.580]  i am really getting speechless joe banister
[3:42:18.580 --> 3:42:22.340]  because it's so ridiculous how corrupt they are but then if you study
[3:42:22.340 --> 3:42:25.220]  i guess criminology like you've done and i've done it as a layman
[3:42:25.220 --> 3:42:28.740]  when criminals and psychos don't don't get caught and get away with it
[3:42:28.740 --> 3:42:33.540]  don't they always just get wilder and wilder that's exactly right and i think
[3:42:33.540 --> 3:42:37.060]  you know the american people we all collectively i mean we you know you and
[3:42:37.060 --> 3:42:40.180]  i and many people all your production team
[3:42:40.180 --> 3:42:43.300]  we're working our butts off as much as we can and when we
[3:42:43.300 --> 3:42:47.140]  our eyes were opened uh you know we we get to work but other people's eyes are
[3:42:47.140 --> 3:42:49.700]  opened and they go back to their easy chair
[3:42:49.700 --> 3:42:53.540]  and this is it's a group effort uh you know
[3:42:53.540 --> 3:42:57.620]  uh people who are just sitting around doing nothing you've got to do something
[3:42:57.620 --> 3:43:00.740]  and and you know my recommendation as always first
[3:43:00.740 --> 3:43:05.620]  is prayer you know we we i believe that collectively we've offended god greatly
[3:43:05.620 --> 3:43:10.180]  and we need to we need to we need to get back to where we're not doing that
[3:43:10.180 --> 3:43:15.060]  but um also watch out for discouragement uh you know when you feel like the
[3:43:15.060 --> 3:43:18.260]  discouragement coming on you know that's the evil forces
[3:43:18.260 --> 3:43:21.860]  trying to disarm you uh and it's going to everybody's going to feel that
[3:43:21.860 --> 3:43:25.380]  discouragement but you know reject it i agree forward
[3:43:25.380 --> 3:43:31.940]  i agree it's just go ahead uh and i as i say i do listen to your show pretty
[3:43:31.940 --> 3:43:36.580]  frequently and you mentioned hogan zeroes and i'm i i talk to people about
[3:43:36.580 --> 3:43:41.140]  hogan zeroes because look at it this way you have these prisoners of war the
[3:43:41.140 --> 3:43:45.620]  germans thought that they were this compliant these compliant slaves who
[3:43:45.620 --> 3:43:49.780]  were immobilized correct and then what would happen at night
[3:43:49.780 --> 3:43:53.140]  they go out into the german countryside and wreak havoc
[3:43:53.140 --> 3:43:58.260]  to the the nazi war effort um you know there's americans out there that may
[3:43:58.260 --> 3:44:00.500]  you know they may be stuck in a job where they can't
[3:44:00.500 --> 3:44:03.700]  you know take on the irs they can't do any of this stuff
[3:44:03.700 --> 3:44:08.340]  but every person can find something that they can do to join this effort
[3:44:08.340 --> 3:44:13.300]  to wreak havoc uh to these tyrants and and i just i'm convinced
[3:44:13.300 --> 3:44:18.820]  everyone can play a role and but stealth is the key i mean people like you and me
[3:44:18.820 --> 3:44:22.420]  you know stealth isn't an option but there's plenty of people that can use
[3:44:22.420 --> 3:44:26.420]  stealth you know don't don't wear your support for ron paul and your sleeve or
[3:44:26.420 --> 3:44:29.940]  your bumper sticker like an colt colter does just
[3:44:29.940 --> 3:44:34.340]  you know do the do the job that needs to get done and do it in stealth
[3:44:34.340 --> 3:44:38.100]  speak of the devil that's another example of want to be co-opting
[3:44:38.100 --> 3:44:41.060]  suddenly she's all for ron paul sozlin back
[3:44:41.060 --> 3:44:45.060]  that shows that we are becoming the majority they
[3:44:45.060 --> 3:44:48.180]  they can see our growth curve we're a huge minority now
[3:44:48.180 --> 3:44:50.980]  but they understand it's just going to keep growing and growing
[3:44:50.980 --> 3:44:54.260]  we are going to be the majority we're almost there
[3:44:54.260 --> 3:44:57.700]  because everything we talked about is coming true what what do you think the
[3:44:57.700 --> 3:45:01.060]  average police officer i've talked a lot of money with their view is but i mean
[3:45:01.060 --> 3:45:04.740]  your take on talking to him or your average federal person
[3:45:04.740 --> 3:45:08.660]  they tell him for decades there's no new world order
[3:45:08.660 --> 3:45:12.020]  and it doesn't exist and it's not happening
[3:45:12.020 --> 3:45:17.620]  and then suddenly uh they come right out on the news and say there is a world
[3:45:17.620 --> 3:45:20.420]  government but it's going to save you from the economic downturn
[3:45:20.420 --> 3:45:23.700]  i've been told that that's really what's waking government people up
[3:45:23.700 --> 3:45:26.900]  is wait a minute you said none of this existed and now you're telling me it's
[3:45:26.900 --> 3:45:30.260]  good right and i i think you know maybe you've
[3:45:30.260 --> 3:45:32.900]  already done it or you're in the process of doing it but i mean
[3:45:32.900 --> 3:45:37.940]  what what needs to be done is a a viral you know dvd
[3:45:37.940 --> 3:45:42.660]  where you can show that you know how long when when you said what you said
[3:45:42.660 --> 3:45:47.540]  10 years ago 15 years ago and show that progression both of what you've been
[3:45:47.540 --> 3:45:51.220]  saying you know and people try and expose the truth about the new world order
[3:45:51.220 --> 3:45:56.660]  and what the other side has been saying so that it was in 45 or 90 minutes
[3:45:56.660 --> 3:46:01.060]  people can see that progression of lies
[3:46:01.060 --> 3:46:03.860]  and uh i think i mean i think there's a lot of
[3:46:03.860 --> 3:46:07.540]  enforcement people that aren't you know they they've dealt with their chief
[3:46:07.540 --> 3:46:11.060]  they've dealt with the assistant chief for the deputy
[3:46:11.060 --> 3:46:14.500]  lieutenant in the sheriff's department and the politics that are involved i
[3:46:14.500 --> 3:46:17.300]  don't think it's a big stretch for them to realize
[3:46:17.300 --> 3:46:21.380]  that people at the top don't care about the rank and file and largely they
[3:46:21.380 --> 3:46:24.180]  don't even care about the citizens they just care about their own pension and
[3:46:24.180 --> 3:46:29.700]  paycheck and their own careers exactly and that becomes a culture of
[3:46:29.700 --> 3:46:33.860]  protecting the other corrupt people until the crimes get worse and worse but
[3:46:33.860 --> 3:46:37.060]  nobody can blow the whistle because it'll bring us all down
[3:46:37.060 --> 3:46:40.500]  and that's what causes societies to implode and fall in on themselves and
[3:46:40.500 --> 3:46:44.580]  yes we have hundreds of shows i've done well thousands of radio shows hundreds
[3:46:44.580 --> 3:46:47.060]  of tv shows i just haven't had the crew to go
[3:46:47.060 --> 3:46:50.660]  back and watch all of that listen to all of that but i've thought about
[3:46:50.660 --> 3:46:55.220]  making that film showing the predictions i made the predictions other people made
[3:46:55.220 --> 3:46:58.500]  and then what's even harder because i'm we remember seeing it and reading it
[3:46:58.500 --> 3:47:01.220]  going back and finding all the news reports where they said that we were
[3:47:01.220 --> 3:47:04.820]  lying and then so show how they were lying how we were telling the truth
[3:47:04.820 --> 3:47:08.340]  and how it's all basically happening now uh... that would be extremely
[3:47:08.340 --> 3:47:11.460]  extremely effective that's like i predicted what glenn beck was gonna
[3:47:11.460 --> 3:47:13.540]  do the other night it wasn't hard to do but that really
[3:47:13.540 --> 3:47:17.780]  impresses people uh... they think it's like magic or something and it's not i
[3:47:17.780 --> 3:47:21.380]  mean it's it's it's these people have like a shaken bake
[3:47:21.380 --> 3:47:24.500]  you know it's like uh... you know the the directions to making pancakes on the
[3:47:24.500 --> 3:47:27.140]  back of a box i mean i know what they're gonna do
[3:47:27.140 --> 3:47:29.940]  i want to bring just an interesting number about three minutes here are real

[3:48:22.660 --> 3:48:25.700]  there absolutely walk new
[3:48:25.700 --> 3:48:29.140]  i think about seven hundred and fifty places citizens out in front of the
[3:48:29.140 --> 3:48:32.100]  news cameras as we take over the media as we take over the coverage
[3:48:32.100 --> 3:48:35.860]  same thing with the tea party same things with all of it we're on the march
[3:48:35.860 --> 3:48:38.980]  empire is on the run and i salute every one of you out there that's why we're
[3:48:38.980 --> 3:48:42.180]  having this effect uh... real fast head anderson i want to get you on the day
[3:48:42.180 --> 3:48:43.140]  because gold
[3:48:43.140 --> 3:48:45.860]  is up fifteen something bucks last time i checked
[3:48:45.860 --> 3:48:48.580]  you've got golden silver again that you buy what's low
[3:48:48.580 --> 3:48:51.860]  you keep the price low when it's high that's how you beat everybody out there
[3:48:51.860 --> 3:48:54.820]  in the industry so i wanted to bring you on for a minute or two to tell folks
[3:48:54.820 --> 3:48:57.220]  about today's offer
[3:48:57.220 --> 3:49:00.660]  thanks for having me up again i tell you gold did hit about eight sixty and i
[3:49:00.660 --> 3:49:03.620]  was buying like as much as i could at that point
[3:49:03.620 --> 3:49:07.060]  i did get into some franks at two fourteen and i've got the british
[3:49:07.060 --> 3:49:11.220]  sovereigns at two sixty seven but one of the things i ran into here in
[3:49:11.220 --> 3:49:16.020]  interestingly enough just here now is the uh... lakota coin the load of lakota
[3:49:16.020 --> 3:49:20.260]  silver round most everybody selling them from twenty to twenty five bucks
[3:49:20.260 --> 3:49:23.460]  and i have the lakota silver rounds right now at eighteen dollars and fifty
[3:49:23.460 --> 3:49:24.500]  cents
[3:49:24.500 --> 3:49:27.860]  uh... that's that that coin that they put the fifty dollars on
[3:49:27.860 --> 3:49:31.620]  and it's that sovereign nation the kota coin it's i i think it's a real neat
[3:49:31.620 --> 3:49:32.580]  little offer
[3:49:32.580 --> 3:49:36.100]  and plus also to get them at eighteen dollars and fifty cents i think that is
[3:49:36.100 --> 3:49:36.580]  a
[3:49:36.580 --> 3:49:39.700]  a really good price to be getting into one on silver rounds
[3:49:39.700 --> 3:49:43.460]  uh... but but basically right now at this time you're right on target alex
[3:49:43.460 --> 3:49:46.180]  the franks currently right now at two fourteen
[3:49:46.180 --> 3:49:50.340]  and that's the same coin that was at two hundred twenty seven here just about three
[3:49:50.340 --> 3:49:53.620]  four weeks ago british sovereigns at two sixty seven
[3:49:53.620 --> 3:49:56.900]  same coin that was at two hundred ninety here just a few weeks ago
[3:49:56.900 --> 3:49:59.780]  so obviously yeah the time is now to be buying in
[3:49:59.780 --> 3:50:02.900]  but that lakota coin at eighteen dollars and fifty cents
[3:50:02.900 --> 3:50:06.740]  that that's a good price for us so yeah well you save me five of those
[3:50:06.740 --> 3:50:10.740]  you have to be happy to of course i'm definitely because these are collector
[3:50:10.740 --> 3:50:11.460]  coins
[3:50:11.460 --> 3:50:14.580]  uh... it's kind of like the uh... ron paul liberty coin that goes for three hundred
[3:50:14.580 --> 3:50:17.220]  bucks you could buy for sixteen dollars
[3:50:17.220 --> 3:50:20.420]  uh... these things really go up and so get that lakota nation
[3:50:20.420 --> 3:50:24.820]  uh... coin one eight hundred six eight six two two three seven eight hundred
[3:50:24.820 --> 3:50:29.140]  six eight six two two three seven the brokers will be there till tonight

[3:56:13.460 --> 3:56:18.100]  came over her eyes and i mean she spent well glenn beck says she was a 10-year-old
[3:56:18.100 --> 3:56:21.540]  child and she spent two years in the forest by herself
[3:56:21.540 --> 3:56:25.620]  it is a 10-year-old and and and uh not talking to anyone and that
[3:56:25.620 --> 3:56:29.620]  story is something else well it doesn't matter according to uh that matter of
[3:56:29.620 --> 3:56:32.980]  congressmen admit they're building camps according to glenn becker everything's
[3:56:32.980 --> 3:56:35.620]  fine but yes ma'am give us that number i appreciate your call
[3:56:35.620 --> 3:56:40.020]  joe uh your comments on the fema camps
[3:56:40.020 --> 3:56:44.020]  uh well i mean i've reviewed the evidence that you've you've
[3:56:44.020 --> 3:56:47.620]  put out there on your website and talked about and uh you know it
[3:56:47.620 --> 3:56:50.340]  it looks convincing to me i mean it's certainly
[3:56:50.340 --> 3:56:54.420]  every bit as solid as anything i saw relating to the income tax
[3:56:54.420 --> 3:56:59.780]  um people need to again look at your look at alex jones' conduct look at what
[3:56:59.780 --> 3:57:05.060]  you've done all these years and you refer to actual government
[3:57:05.060 --> 3:57:10.260]  documents mainstream reports um you know the reason i was
[3:57:10.260 --> 3:57:14.980]  convinced was because of the people that made these claims pointed to real
[3:57:14.980 --> 3:57:18.740]  stuff you know not just some phony photocopy machine
[3:57:18.740 --> 3:57:23.860]  doctored up things real evidence yeah that's our biggest problem is that you
[3:57:23.860 --> 3:57:28.260]  have to expect this humanity's diverse the media twisted spins and lies but
[3:57:28.260 --> 3:57:32.260]  the alternative media it's as varied as fish in the sea you know i mean it's
[3:57:32.260 --> 3:57:35.540]  there's a lot of crap out there yeah but you know
[3:57:35.540 --> 3:57:39.380]  you with history with the nazis i mean certainly they had
[3:57:39.380 --> 3:57:42.580]  camps and all these kinds of things that we're seeing now
[3:57:42.580 --> 3:57:46.180]  is what they had before they went to what you know
[3:57:46.180 --> 3:57:49.700]  imprisoning people murdering people i mean these are the precursors they have
[3:57:49.700 --> 3:57:51.940]  to do something with the bodies they have to do
[3:57:51.940 --> 3:57:55.940]  they have to get people to go to these camps somehow they have to
[3:57:55.940 --> 3:57:59.620]  fool people so i mean we've seen it laid out how it's done
[3:57:59.620 --> 3:58:04.500]  and you're pointing out the similarities and i hope people are waking up
[3:58:04.500 --> 3:58:07.380]  joe banister freedom above fortune dot com
