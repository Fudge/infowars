[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:28.280]  we're gonna have a farewell interview with dr. Paul Craig Roberts who announced a
[00:28.280 --> 00:31.040]  week and a half ago that he is retiring from the fight against the New
[00:31.040 --> 00:36.000]  World Order he'll be with us for a full hour to discuss the tyranny that has
[00:36.000 --> 00:41.200]  taken over our nation and why I guess he thinks it's a lost cause at least for
[00:41.200 --> 00:45.800]  now and we'll break down why the father of Reaganomics the former head of
[00:45.800 --> 00:52.360]  policy the US Treasury a former editor of the Wall Street Journal is saying
[00:52.360 --> 00:58.960]  cyanara so that is coming up in the next hour there have been new developments
[00:58.960 --> 01:05.520]  and pieces of the puzzle dealing with the gun camera pod footage out of two
[01:05.520 --> 01:14.080]  different Apache helicopters in Iraq with the pilot directing the gunners and
[01:14.080 --> 01:19.080]  we're gonna be talking about that today and we have some really horrible news
[01:19.080 --> 01:22.400]  for everyone but it's really not news for this audience but I want to talk
[01:22.400 --> 01:28.880]  about the strategy they're going to use to pass this the stratagem and our
[01:28.880 --> 01:37.000]  strategy to defeat it they have had Republicans for about 16 years that I'm
[01:37.000 --> 01:41.720]  aware even two years before I was on air I went to Republican meetings all over
[01:41.720 --> 01:49.600]  the state Dallas Fredericksburg you name it and they would have speakers there
[01:49.600 --> 01:56.120]  pushing a value-added tax or national sales tax different combinations of them
[01:56.120 --> 02:01.320]  as a way to get rid of the income tax and so I did some research and found out
[02:01.320 --> 02:05.640]  that Federal Reserve allied banks were the ones promoting this and I already
[02:05.640 --> 02:11.160]  knew when I was in college 16 years ago that the central banks always want to
[02:11.160 --> 02:16.680]  raise taxes and so we discovered by the time I got on air 14 and a half 15
[02:16.680 --> 02:22.680]  years ago that this was a long-term strategic operation to make it a tenant
[02:22.680 --> 02:27.960]  of conservatism kind of a Pavlovian response where they ding a bell and
[02:27.960 --> 02:32.240]  conservatives roll over and beg for it as if it's something good it's like
[02:32.240 --> 02:37.760]  begging for a bullet in the head and I've explained for all these years that
[02:37.760 --> 02:42.040]  what Neil Boerts promotes what all these people promote the so-called fair
[02:42.040 --> 02:47.800]  taxes and different variants would be brought in at the time of the financial
[02:47.800 --> 02:54.160]  collapse due to social security the defense budget the bank debt and now
[02:54.160 --> 02:59.560]  here we are it's 2010 I've been warning you for over 14 years and they're not
[02:59.560 --> 03:02.480]  gonna get rid of the income tax ladies and gentlemen they're gonna give you a
[03:02.480 --> 03:07.120]  VAT and they're gonna give you carbon taxes and everything on top of it
[03:07.120 --> 03:14.160]  this is like extra layers of icing this is to bring us into line with the
[03:14.160 --> 03:18.280]  United Nations with the European Union that's what the new order is is it's a
[03:18.280 --> 03:21.760]  global corporate takeover of government and then they don't want the middle
[03:21.760 --> 03:25.240]  class being able to grow or become wealthy and challenge them so they set
[03:25.240 --> 03:31.320]  up a global regime to quote shut down tax havens the US and England believe it
[03:31.320 --> 03:36.760]  or not the average Brit pays over 60% in taxes the average American pays more
[03:36.760 --> 03:41.600]  than half of taxes that's the average person wealthy people are paying above
[03:41.600 --> 03:48.880]  60% in this nation and so that's the new world order is it it's a global straight
[03:48.880 --> 03:52.840]  jacket of regulation and control now when I say wealthy people I mean people
[03:52.840 --> 03:58.400]  making 200,000 a couple million a year the way the tax laws are set up that
[03:58.400 --> 04:03.160]  once you're at a billionaire level or a global corporation level you pay almost
[04:03.160 --> 04:07.360]  no taxes they've got the special lawyers they've got the loopholes they've got it
[04:07.360 --> 04:11.400]  all set up so when you hear about the IRS and they're gonna go after offshore
[04:11.400 --> 04:14.560]  money that's people with five million dollars or even a hundred thousand
[04:14.560 --> 04:17.880]  offshore that was legally put there they're gonna change the laws they're
[04:17.880 --> 04:21.680]  now saying it to retroactively take your money and they're clamping new
[04:21.680 --> 04:26.880]  regulatory powers in this week outside of law where you can't take a dollar
[04:26.880 --> 04:31.040]  outside the US you're gonna stay here and they're gonna rob you and they got
[04:31.040 --> 04:36.360]  paramilitary police that are gonna back up their tax collectors and America you
[04:36.360 --> 04:41.960]  ain't seen nothing yet here's the Wall Street Journal Volcker carbon tax VAT
[04:41.960 --> 04:47.680]  should be on the table and they are on the table and you're gonna have all your
[04:47.680 --> 04:51.200]  chicken feed services cut that domesticated you it's now time to
[04:51.200 --> 04:54.880]  slaughter the hogs they've been done fattening you up and everything's gonna
[04:54.880 --> 05:00.280]  go to the bankers and they're enforcer police get ready to bend over they help

[05:15.160 --> 05:19.160]  addressing a new world of possibilities it means all the world under their
[05:19.160 --> 05:23.920]  control the United Nations would take over America the trilateral Commission
[05:23.920 --> 05:28.480]  would control the world invisible Empire Chronicles how men of power and
[05:28.480 --> 05:32.400]  influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive

[05:40.080 --> 05:44.360]  the establishment of the G20 so it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then

[08:11.000 --> 08:19.200]  Wednesday the 7th day of April 2010 Dr. Paul Craig Roberts for his swan song
[08:19.200 --> 08:25.200]  interview will be joining us coming up in the next hour via video connection

[08:30.000 --> 08:36.000]  this Wednesday edition okay I want to put an exclamation point behind what I'm
[08:36.000 --> 08:40.000]  about to talk about and I want to underline it and I want to highlight it
[08:40.000 --> 08:45.960]  in bright yellow and then I want to draw arrows pointing at what I'm about to say
[08:45.960 --> 08:51.160]  on each side and I want to scream it through a megaphone metaphorically I
[08:51.160 --> 08:56.080]  get up here and I tell you what the new world order is doing who they are what
[08:56.080 --> 09:03.040]  their mindset is what their game plan is and we're now getting very deep into
[09:03.040 --> 09:08.880]  the rat hole here it's all manifesting everything we told you is now happening
[09:08.880 --> 09:13.640]  exactly as we said it would happen why because I read their own documents I
[09:13.640 --> 09:18.880]  read their own statements I do it three four five hours a day so this is not
[09:18.880 --> 09:24.680]  Alex Jones telling you this this is the absolute fact what we cover here is facts
[09:24.680 --> 09:29.360]  what we cover here is documents what we cover here is history what we cover here
[09:29.360 --> 09:34.120]  is what the globalist technicians and social engineers and futurists are
[09:34.120 --> 09:37.240]  stating they were going to build and I've read what they said a hundred years
[09:37.240 --> 09:43.120]  ago out of England that runs the whole show and what they said 50 years ago what
[09:43.120 --> 09:46.280]  they said five years ago what they said last month and everything they say
[09:46.280 --> 09:50.720]  they're going to do they do now they say they're going to bankrupt all of us and
[09:50.720 --> 09:58.800]  force us into a nanny state with aggressive paramilitary social workers
[09:58.800 --> 10:02.760]  and control freaks running our lives they are going to break up our families
[10:02.760 --> 10:06.520]  they are going to further brainwash the public they are going to forcibly drug
[10:06.520 --> 10:11.120]  the public they are forcibly drugging the water supply and the GMO food they are
[10:11.120 --> 10:14.320]  going to forcibly inoculate you they are going to take your blood warrantlessly
[10:14.320 --> 10:18.280]  at checkpoints already happening they've been taking your baby's blood for 37
[10:18.280 --> 10:22.800]  years at birth in every industrialized nation part of a UN secret treaty that's
[10:22.800 --> 10:29.240]  now mainstream news there isn't time to screw around here I've prayed to God
[10:29.240 --> 10:33.840]  Almighty I woke up at four in the morning couldn't go back to sleep and just
[10:33.840 --> 10:38.720]  ask God please help me be focused please help me be serious please help me
[10:38.720 --> 10:44.120]  articulate to people just how unbelievably evil this is so that we can
[10:44.120 --> 10:49.520]  stop it this doesn't have to happen if people will wake up and face the dire
[10:49.520 --> 10:55.320]  situation we're in we can reverse this if serious men and women who are more
[10:55.320 --> 11:01.520]  intelligent and more eloquent and more financially endowed than I would simply
[11:01.520 --> 11:05.740]  get in the fight and not be manipulated into the Republican Party or the
[11:05.740 --> 11:12.720]  Democratic Party or the Labor Party or the Tory Party in England or the Socialist
[11:12.720 --> 11:19.800]  in Germany or the Social Democrats in Germany if you would simply research the
[11:19.800 --> 11:24.960]  architecture of the New World Order and the public blueprints thousands of
[11:24.960 --> 11:29.760]  public blueprints at every level of society I have read these thousands of
[11:29.760 --> 11:37.680]  blueprints they call them blueprints when I make a film called endgame
[11:38.960 --> 11:47.880]  blueprint for global enslavement that's a term they use Jason Burmes's film a
[11:47.880 --> 11:55.480]  New World Order defined invisible Empire those terms come from elite
[11:55.480 --> 12:08.000]  publications it's one thing to know all of this is coming and to see it year
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.560]  after year be implemented but to be coming to a road sign on this road to
[12:14.560 --> 12:22.520]  tyranny that signifies we are deep deep deep inside now shakes me it shakes me
[12:22.520 --> 12:26.760]  because I love innocent people I love good people I love hardworking people I
[12:26.760 --> 12:31.640]  love the power of the free market and individuals being able to keep just
[12:31.640 --> 12:35.400]  something of what they earn and being able to have some control over what they
[12:35.400 --> 12:42.240]  do I know what collectivism and bondage and slavery is and there is no doubt we
[12:42.240 --> 12:48.680]  are in a scientific tyranny we are going deeper into a scientific dictatorship
[12:48.680 --> 12:56.440]  and it has the most horrible aims and goals at the end of the road all of the
[12:56.440 --> 12:59.480]  cancer viruses in the vaccine and the hundreds of deadly chemicals in the
[12:59.480 --> 13:03.680]  water and the GMO foods in every case that just so happened to have a side
[13:03.680 --> 13:07.560]  effect of reducing fertility and causing cancer it's not a side effect it's the
[13:07.560 --> 13:12.680]  main effect and the militarization of police and the FEMA camps and the
[13:12.680 --> 13:19.800]  illegal wars and the torture and the secret arrest and all of it is a means
[13:19.800 --> 13:25.600]  to an end and it's stated by the State Department by the UN by the Club of
[13:25.600 --> 13:31.120]  Rome and by every major globalist institution that once they've got this
[13:31.120 --> 13:35.400]  thing in place all the murder and death and extermination you've seen was
[13:35.400 --> 13:40.880]  testing was a laboratory test they call Afghanistan a laboratory they call Iraq
[13:40.880 --> 13:47.800]  a laboratory they publicly call Abu Ghraib and camp x-ray laboratories where
[13:47.800 --> 13:58.320]  they practice their craft and the end game is to kill you and I know that's
[13:58.320 --> 14:01.480]  hard for some people to really come to grips with but that's what we're
[14:01.480 --> 14:04.360]  talking about here that's why I'm not worried about being killed or being
[14:04.360 --> 14:09.920]  tortured that's why I don't have any fear I don't have fear for my body I have
[14:09.920 --> 14:14.440]  fear of failing I have fear of not stopping these people and not awakening
[14:14.440 --> 14:20.680]  as many people as I possibly can I only have anger and disgust with myself for
[14:20.680 --> 14:26.120]  not being more strong not being a greater orator not being more focused but
[14:26.120 --> 14:30.280]  I'm human I'm not perfect but I can't help the level of disgust I have for
[14:30.280 --> 14:34.640]  myself because I know how real this is and I catch myself going to movies I
[14:34.640 --> 14:38.080]  catch myself going to steak houses I catch myself you know getting into
[14:38.080 --> 14:42.800]  comedy and diversions and it's true that all work and no play makes Jack a dull
[14:42.800 --> 14:49.760]  boy but even when I take a few hours off a week for myself I can't the enemies
[14:49.760 --> 14:53.160]  coming over the parapets here ladies and gentlemen they're inside the fortress
[14:53.160 --> 14:57.400]  they're there they're attacking us on every angle they're trafficking and
[14:57.400 --> 15:01.640]  men's souls they're turning people into psychopaths that serve them they're
[15:01.640 --> 15:07.600]  twisting our humanity they're warping us and I understand why you don't want to
[15:07.600 --> 15:10.440]  focus on this I understand why you don't want to get involved fighting this
[15:10.440 --> 15:14.960]  because you at a subconscious level are afraid and don't have respect for
[15:14.960 --> 15:20.120]  yourselves and can't see yourself as a leader in that role all I'm telling you
[15:20.120 --> 15:25.720]  is this is an emergency global worldwide beacon putting out an SOS to the
[15:25.720 --> 15:30.520]  planet that I have done the research and many others have as well and it is
[15:30.520 --> 15:36.240]  written on the wall clearly for all to see and that's why I just want to say
[15:36.240 --> 15:44.920]  alert alert alert alert emergency emergency emergency emergency we have a
[15:44.920 --> 15:50.040]  scientific group of control freak tyrants who openly brag in hundreds of
[15:50.040 --> 15:53.560]  publications that they've studied tyrannies of the past and that they are
[15:53.560 --> 16:00.320]  bringing forth what they believe is their greatest creation an invincible evil
[16:00.880 --> 16:04.720]  hundreds of different forms of propaganda and mind control woven
[16:04.720 --> 16:11.480]  together chemical biological attacks on the population ongoing incremental
[16:11.480 --> 16:22.440]  creeping death the new morals are torture and war and lies and corruption and
[16:22.440 --> 16:33.160]  delusion and disease and it's because I understand the enemy's mind and I'm
[16:33.160 --> 16:38.200]  here exposing it they are coming after us there were four more articles I saw
[16:38.200 --> 16:43.320]  yesterday where the media is lying and saying I am calling for violence and for
[16:43.320 --> 16:49.400]  killing police and IRS workers and I want to be careful here I don't want to
[16:49.400 --> 16:53.760]  address this as if I'm on the defensive and I'm here saying it's not true you
[16:53.760 --> 17:01.280]  know it's not true of course it's not true and this shows how diabolical these
[17:01.280 --> 17:07.720]  people are George Soros's media matters has come out with one of the most
[17:07.720 --> 17:13.880]  vicious pieces I've ever seen openly claiming that I'm calling for violence
[17:13.880 --> 17:20.160]  clearly as a preparatory phase to try to sick the police and the IRS on us and
[17:20.160 --> 17:31.920]  I'm not afraid of that I'm not but I do get worried because I want to continue
[17:31.920 --> 17:41.240]  my work but it is the signal it is the seal it is the logo on our work that
[17:41.240 --> 17:53.280]  they are coming against us Alex Jones pits Fox News versus Fox News I'm gonna
[17:53.280 --> 18:02.600]  read this later we have a lot of good news as well though we're gonna be
[18:02.600 --> 18:09.080]  covering once we're live on Prison Planet TV I can show you NASA time-lapse
[18:09.080 --> 18:19.000]  video from satellite of the Arctic the North Pole what the news does is they
[18:19.000 --> 18:24.680]  show you in the spring and summer the Arctic and the Antarctic and they both
[18:24.680 --> 18:28.120]  have a different spring and summer and they will show it shrinking in the summer
[18:28.120 --> 18:35.360]  and say look it's all melting not telling you that in the fall and winter it
[18:35.360 --> 18:43.080]  will then expand again it's a very simple parlor trick but it scares children
[18:43.080 --> 18:51.280]  in the schools when they show them the video but the good news is this is the
[18:51.280 --> 18:58.280]  biggest ice growth in a winter in 30 years according to NASA satellites this
[18:58.280 --> 19:05.640]  is in business week AP you name it and it also isn't just the biggest growth in
[19:05.640 --> 19:11.800]  30 years this is the latest time in the year that it began to thaw satellite show
[19:11.800 --> 19:17.960]  that two days ago some of the edges of the giant ice sheet began to break up
[19:17.960 --> 19:26.400]  and form ice floes and icebergs it's another parlor trick the media does
[19:26.400 --> 19:30.360]  they'll go point a camera at an ice flow or at a glacier and show it collapsing
[19:30.360 --> 19:33.480]  well it builds up every year with rainfall and then of course it's always
[19:33.480 --> 19:39.120]  growing so it's collapsing out another parlor trick they use but now it's a
[19:39.120 --> 19:44.360]  huge another devastating blow because they're having to admit okay Antarctic
[19:44.360 --> 19:49.640]  excuse me the Arctic and Antarctic but this reports the Arctic the North Pole
[19:49.640 --> 19:55.360]  is just exploding in size but I'll get into the value-added tax and the carbon

[24:03.000 --> 24:10.240]  don't worry this show is documented Alex Jones on the GCN radio network I fell
[24:10.240 --> 24:17.800]  into a burning ring of fire I went down down down okay flames went higher for
[24:17.800 --> 24:27.160]  more than 15 years that's just when I discovered it the Republican Party has
[24:27.160 --> 24:36.080]  been preparing conservatives to believe in a value-added tax national sales
[24:36.080 --> 24:43.160]  taxes and other taxes as a Valhalla as a heaven as a way to really defeat the IRS
[24:43.160 --> 24:52.280]  you notice the IRS is implementing the Obamacare the Barry Sotaro care and of
[24:52.280 --> 25:03.880]  course 94% of the lobbyist money up from the healthcare industry went to pushing
[25:03.880 --> 25:11.280]  the takeover of healthcare this is not some communist conspiracy oh it's
[25:11.280 --> 25:14.920]  communism for us at the ground level but only to feed the money into the banks
[25:14.920 --> 25:19.680]  they are the authors of it all and until Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh and Sean
[25:19.680 --> 25:24.040]  Hannity start explaining to you that mega corporations are the enemy and
[25:24.040 --> 25:29.720]  that they're the ones behind this we're going nowhere the Democrats lie to their
[25:29.720 --> 25:34.000]  constituents this has all been set up and they tell them oh we're going to give
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.880]  you something free when they cut Medicare and Medicaid raise the taxes and
[25:37.880 --> 25:40.920]  lower the standard of care and now they're admitting all this you won't
[25:40.920 --> 25:45.840]  get knee surgery you'll get a $10 cortisone steroid shot in your name
[25:45.840 --> 25:50.560]  that was in the news yesterday we will decide with these government boards what
[25:50.560 --> 25:53.960]  healthcare you get the insurance companies absolutely love it they'll get
[25:53.960 --> 25:59.080]  the money overcharge you for that and then be able with regular citizens who's
[25:59.080 --> 26:03.240]  paid for their insurance to cut back on your care to quote keep costs down in
[26:03.240 --> 26:08.120]  the industry this is the trick of collectivism once they get you under
[26:08.120 --> 26:11.720]  their control they just expand the control and reduce you to the level of
[26:11.720 --> 26:16.360]  feudal serfs slavery is what we're talking about here high-tech 21st century
[26:16.360 --> 26:22.760]  slavery now it's the same thing with VAT taxes you've got Obama proposing it
[26:22.760 --> 26:26.440]  you've got socialist Europe that's had it for decades you've got England that's
[26:26.440 --> 26:32.160]  got it the communist Chinese have got it and it's now being proposed as
[26:32.160 --> 26:35.960]  conservative and the supposed conservative that runs Obama's economic
[26:35.960 --> 26:41.920]  team Volcker is saying we have to have it or we're bankrupt and Glenn Beck and
[26:41.920 --> 26:47.880]  Neil Boerts and every one of these people is all over their TV and radio
[26:47.880 --> 26:52.640]  shows for years pushing that we've got to have these new taxes to get rid of the
[26:52.640 --> 26:56.800]  income tax and I told you for 14 and a half years they're not going to get rid
[26:56.800 --> 27:03.160]  of any of them they're going to give you new taxes and they're also going to
[27:03.160 --> 27:06.800]  track and trace everything you do and they're going to make it a felony to
[27:06.800 --> 27:13.320]  have a garage sale or to be at a gun show and not pay the taxes and you've
[27:13.320 --> 27:16.400]  already seen them make it a felony and a million dollar fine I mean that's even
[27:16.400 --> 27:21.880]  AP and Fox News last year regularly if you have tens of thousands of so-called
[27:21.880 --> 27:26.720]  recalled products if you sell any of those unknowingly at your garage sale
[27:26.720 --> 27:33.040]  that's getting the camel's nose under the tent flap and I tune into Glenn Beck
[27:33.040 --> 27:42.400]  maybe once a week and most times I tune in he's plugging VAT so is O'Reilly
[27:42.400 --> 27:49.160]  we're gonna play a clip of that coming up now if you so-called conservatives
[27:49.160 --> 27:52.680]  out there that love all these illegal wars and love torture and love the
[27:52.680 --> 27:56.320]  Patriot Act and love warrantless spying and love North com and think it's all
[27:56.320 --> 27:59.880]  cute and we need the military on our streets and if you don't like it you're
[27:59.880 --> 28:06.320]  a traitor you're going to be raped okay and it's your fault for being fools I
[28:06.320 --> 28:10.800]  know most of you are as smart as I am or smarter so you don't have any excuse
[28:10.800 --> 28:16.400]  anymore okay just no excuses if you don't wake up fully right now to the full
[28:16.400 --> 28:20.600]  paradigm and start deciphering the tricks they use to divide and conquer us
[28:20.600 --> 28:26.480]  it's over because that's what the new world order is it is global
[28:26.480 --> 28:31.760]  standardization of taxes when Obama I've gotten emails in Jason Burmese's
[28:31.760 --> 28:37.880]  trailer for Invisible Empire people say are you saying Obama's good he says no
[28:37.880 --> 28:42.880]  new world order can lift any other nation above any other no when he says
[28:42.880 --> 28:46.480]  that that doesn't mean raise other nations that means lower the wealthy
[28:46.480 --> 28:52.280]  nations that had free market systems that means lowering everyone lowering us
[28:52.280 --> 28:57.360]  to third world level where we can be managed and control it's bad what he's
[28:57.360 --> 29:04.560]  saying I mean don't people have any smarts out there I mean I'm I look at
[29:04.560 --> 29:07.000]  the YouTube comments and I've gotten countless emails about it what are you
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.920]  doing having Obama saying the new world order is bad he's not saying the new
[29:09.920 --> 29:14.520]  world order is bad he's saying the essence of the new world order that's
[29:14.520 --> 29:18.880]  what it is and they openly announced at the G20 that they want global tax
[29:18.880 --> 29:23.040]  standardization set by the private banks much of the taxes paid directly to the
[29:23.040 --> 29:27.360]  private banks so I'm gonna break this down when we get back
[29:27.360 --> 29:34.680]  Volcker carbon tax VAT should be on the table that's out of the Wall Street

[34:53.320 --> 34:56.760]  and they have upwards of an eighty five percent tax rate when you add them all
[34:56.760 --> 35:00.760]  together same thing in france some people pay over ninety percent in
[35:00.760 --> 35:01.600]  france
[35:01.600 --> 35:03.880]  that is the model
[35:03.880 --> 35:06.040]  and the ten percent of the money you get to keep
[35:06.040 --> 35:08.920]  they decide what you can spend it on
[35:08.920 --> 35:12.640]  the problem is everyone then fled france in finland england
[35:12.640 --> 35:16.560]  with their only fifty five to sixty percent tax rate total
[35:16.560 --> 35:20.120]  and they openly stated gordon brown and others we must raise taxes
[35:20.120 --> 35:21.720]  to match europe
[35:21.720 --> 35:25.000]  and the u.s. must raise their taxes to match us
[35:25.000 --> 35:30.000]  and they're already in europe calling for more taxes in the e you
[35:30.000 --> 35:31.480]  members
[35:31.480 --> 35:33.120]  the bureaucrats
[35:33.120 --> 35:38.200]  are exempt that's mainstream news they are exempt from their own taxes they
[35:38.200 --> 35:41.760]  pay seventeen percent
[35:41.760 --> 35:45.400]  just like at the leadership of the house and senate and the executive
[35:45.400 --> 35:50.180]  are all exempt from obama care that's associated press
[35:50.180 --> 35:51.840]  another key
[35:51.840 --> 35:56.280]  indicator of absolute tyranny absolute corruption
[35:56.280 --> 35:58.440]  is when the elites
[35:58.440 --> 36:02.840]  the alpha maggots the ruling class are exempt
[36:02.840 --> 36:05.660]  from the systems they foist on
[36:05.660 --> 36:09.320]  the chattel surfs
[36:09.320 --> 36:13.160]  so you have warren buffett and all these big insurance company owners lobbying
[36:13.160 --> 36:17.680]  pushing throwing everything they cut in to take control of one-seventh of the
[36:17.680 --> 36:18.840]  u.s. economy
[36:18.840 --> 36:22.160]  they sees the factories under the greenhouse taxes they sees the car
[36:22.160 --> 36:23.360]  companies
[36:23.360 --> 36:26.280]  they're seizing the cities that they've bankrupted by design the law
[36:26.280 --> 36:28.440]  enforcement they quietly federalize
[36:28.440 --> 36:30.160]  a total takeover
[36:30.160 --> 36:32.840]  is now happening
[36:32.840 --> 36:36.680]  and the worst the economy gets the more taxes they'll raise the more people
[36:36.680 --> 36:38.360]  will go on the government payroll
[36:38.360 --> 36:41.920]  the more people go on welfare the higher the debts will go the more they'll
[36:41.920 --> 36:46.080]  squeeze the middle class always squeezing always pressing
[36:46.080 --> 36:52.760]  always domesticating
[36:52.760 --> 36:54.440]  and this is a
[36:54.440 --> 36:58.280]  fearful master to wicked master
[36:58.280 --> 36:59.520]  dangerous
[36:59.520 --> 37:01.400]  like fire
[37:01.400 --> 37:05.440]  a dangerous servant a fearful master george washington
[37:05.440 --> 37:07.080]  government is forced
[37:07.080 --> 37:09.720]  it is not reason
[37:09.720 --> 37:13.600]  it is special interest coming in with the power of the gun
[37:13.600 --> 37:15.680]  and robbing you
[37:15.680 --> 37:17.960]  running your life deciding
[37:17.960 --> 37:20.440]  if you can have a business
[37:20.440 --> 37:27.440]  selectively enforcing
[37:27.560 --> 37:29.880]  and so now here we are after
[37:29.880 --> 37:34.680]  more than fifteen years of constant brainwashing as if it was a sacrament as
[37:34.680 --> 37:37.360]  if it was
[37:37.360 --> 37:40.000]  Passover as if it was
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.680]  of the breaking of bread and communion
[37:42.680 --> 37:47.680]  that we will have a sales tax we will have a value-added tax we must have it
[37:47.680 --> 37:51.000]  we must get rid of the income tax
[37:51.000 --> 37:54.880]  and then now they shift gears suddenly in the last year
[37:54.880 --> 37:57.880]  and say we've got to pay off this debt
[37:57.880 --> 38:03.520]  we've got to have all these new value-added taxes
[38:03.520 --> 38:09.320]  Sarah Palin says global warming is real they cheer her
[38:09.320 --> 38:13.000]  so does john mccain
[38:13.000 --> 38:13.880]  in fact
[38:13.880 --> 38:17.440]  let's go ahead and play that glenbeck clip on O'Reilly where they're
[38:17.440 --> 38:21.360]  jousting with each other over what type of new national tax we need
[38:21.360 --> 38:23.760]  and telling everyone how fair it is and how
[38:23.760 --> 38:25.840]  conservative it is
[38:25.840 --> 38:27.960]  right on time for Obama
[38:27.960 --> 38:30.160]  to begin pushing it
[38:30.160 --> 38:34.080]  because this is what the elite wants is what the banks want they want another tax
[38:34.080 --> 38:37.640]  not just their carbon taxes not just their health care tax
[38:37.640 --> 38:40.080]  not just their other tax increases and
[38:40.080 --> 38:43.720]  unfunded mandates expanding against the states already more than ten states
[38:43.720 --> 38:45.800]  bankrupt or going bankrupt
[38:45.800 --> 38:49.000]  driving everyone into submission with a tell of the hunt
[38:49.000 --> 38:50.440]  economic warfare
[38:50.440 --> 38:52.400]  here it is
[38:52.400 --> 38:57.160]  factor every night yes so you can steal material oh my god uh... and i said
[38:57.160 --> 38:57.960]  that
[38:57.960 --> 39:00.800]  economically we can bring the country back
[39:00.800 --> 39:04.640]  but you have to do some discipline yet to free spending yep you have to have a
[39:04.640 --> 39:07.040]  national sales tax dot percent
[39:07.040 --> 39:08.200]  what do you think about that
[39:08.200 --> 39:10.400]  uh... actually
[39:10.400 --> 39:13.360]  i made some notes excellent i actually agree with you except
[39:13.360 --> 39:17.680]  i believe it should be a vat tax two percent vat value added no more no more
[39:17.680 --> 39:21.200]  than two percent what's the difference between the sales tax and about it's
[39:21.200 --> 39:25.080]  a value-added tax goes through our value-added tax goes through absolutely
[39:25.080 --> 39:27.640]  everything so it hits two percent on
[39:27.640 --> 39:30.560]  every piece you make a car somebody's making the radio two percent somebody's
[39:30.560 --> 39:31.240]  making that
[39:31.240 --> 39:36.400]  so it hits the corporations it is all the way along the line if you remember
[39:36.400 --> 39:39.720]  that's an extraordinary amount of money will always pass it on to the folks
[39:39.720 --> 39:41.800]  which is why i like the sales tax better
[39:41.800 --> 39:43.240]  well you can just a second
[39:43.240 --> 39:47.640]  but if you have a two percent vat uh... you can uh... pay things down awfully
[39:47.640 --> 39:49.600]  darn quickly that's what i want is a
[39:49.600 --> 39:51.680]  what i want is this is the part of the notes
[39:51.680 --> 39:57.520]  i want a two percent uh... vat it goes directly to the uh... deficit
[39:57.520 --> 40:01.040]  no more place house no more than ten years constitutional amendment and it
[40:01.040 --> 40:02.160]  must be uh...
[40:02.160 --> 40:04.920]  with a balanced budget amendment also must say
[40:04.920 --> 40:08.960]  that the books are combined no longer okay emergency accounting
[40:08.960 --> 40:09.880]  so
[40:09.880 --> 40:12.540]  they'll push it through none of that will be done
[40:12.540 --> 40:16.320]  and you notice it says it all goes to the deficit all goes to the bank
[40:16.320 --> 40:18.400]  a constitutional amendment
[40:18.400 --> 40:23.560]  that one hundred percent of your taxes go to the bankers all in that great
[40:23.560 --> 40:27.320]  which is shock therapy under the imf world bank
[40:27.320 --> 40:29.840]  documents that were released in two thousand and two
[40:29.840 --> 40:33.160]  you know people like to make fun of the third world of an apathetic and lazy
[40:33.160 --> 40:35.000]  they are and why can't they get it together
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.960]  they were all colonial colonies they never got to have a free market they
[40:37.960 --> 40:39.640]  never got to have private property
[40:39.640 --> 40:42.560]  all they got was a few king pins that were put in power
[40:42.560 --> 40:46.120]  by the western powers in the last four hundred years whether it's africa
[40:46.120 --> 40:48.320]  asia or latin america
[40:48.320 --> 40:50.160]  north america was different
[40:50.160 --> 40:54.320]  it wasn't perfect but we had basic property rises and low taxes
[40:54.320 --> 40:58.480]  and so four percent of the world population had fifty one percent of the
[40:58.480 --> 41:01.640]  world's wealth until about nineteen eighty five
[41:01.640 --> 41:04.600]  now we've gone from the wealthiest country in the world
[41:04.600 --> 41:09.000]  to the most in debt and in two thousand and seven january first we passed the
[41:09.000 --> 41:09.800]  line
[41:09.800 --> 41:14.320]  to being in more debt and having a bigger debt versus savings ratio
[41:14.320 --> 41:18.400]  then in nineteen thirty three in the depths of the depression
[41:18.400 --> 41:20.920]  we're now dependent we're now bankrupt
[41:20.920 --> 41:24.920]  more people are on government payroll or getting government subsidies and even
[41:24.920 --> 41:26.640]  pay taxes
[41:26.640 --> 41:30.200]  they've now got a giant army of people that are happy to get six hundred
[41:30.200 --> 41:32.280]  dollars a month
[41:32.280 --> 41:34.400]  they think this is freedom to be a slave
[41:34.400 --> 41:38.640]  and given their little bag of beans and rice each week
[41:38.640 --> 41:40.320]  and so they're now the weapon
[41:40.320 --> 41:44.360]  and then others in this government class can be cops or bureaucrats and as long
[41:44.360 --> 41:45.800]  as they push for more government
[41:45.800 --> 41:48.840]  and as long as they are servile and all their allegiance to whatever the
[41:48.840 --> 41:49.600]  corporate
[41:49.600 --> 41:53.440]  rulers say that control the government they will move up the chain and maybe
[41:53.440 --> 41:55.840]  get three hundred four hundred thousand dollars a year
[41:55.840 --> 42:00.200]  as a superintendent of schools or as a police chief
[42:00.200 --> 42:01.320]  or as a
[42:01.320 --> 42:05.080]  uh... private orphanage or as a drug company
[42:05.080 --> 42:09.680]  uh... salesman
[42:09.680 --> 42:12.980]  because the banks have unlimited money they create of nothing they loaned to our
[42:12.980 --> 42:14.920]  governments they learned to the public they
[42:14.920 --> 42:18.080]  buy off all of our people
[42:18.080 --> 42:21.480]  and so now here we are in two thousand and ten
[42:21.480 --> 42:24.840]  bush triple the size of government
[42:24.840 --> 42:27.720]  clinton gobbled the size of government
[42:27.720 --> 42:31.080]  bush senior increased government by about thirty percent
[42:31.080 --> 42:33.640]  reagan increased government
[42:33.640 --> 42:37.320]  and obama spent in a year and he's now a year and a half in
[42:37.320 --> 42:38.600]  in a year
[42:38.600 --> 42:43.160]  more money than all presidents before him combined from george w
[42:43.160 --> 42:48.440]  george washington
[42:48.440 --> 42:50.000]  think about that
[42:50.000 --> 42:53.120]  but that's thinking
[42:53.120 --> 42:54.800]  it's only expanding
[42:54.800 --> 42:57.960]  they're not cutting anything but your benefits they're not cutting anything
[42:57.960 --> 43:02.360]  that your social security your medicare your medicare which yes people paid
[43:02.360 --> 43:03.120]  into
[43:03.120 --> 43:06.960]  and they're going through through the inflation of the dollar
[43:06.960 --> 43:08.480]  through the
[43:08.480 --> 43:10.160]  destruction of its value
[43:10.160 --> 43:13.320]  through all these cost increases you've already been cheated out of it but
[43:13.320 --> 43:14.440]  because you
[43:14.440 --> 43:16.960]  that's all you got you're gonna stay in
[43:16.960 --> 43:19.560]  and you're gonna let him raise taxes on everybody else on your children and
[43:19.560 --> 43:21.000]  grandchildren because
[43:21.000 --> 43:21.640]  you know yet
[43:21.640 --> 43:24.280]  well that's i mean you're only getting six hundred bucks on average a month i
[43:24.280 --> 43:24.720]  mean
[43:24.720 --> 43:31.720]  what are you supposed to do you pay into the thing for forty years i mean come on
[43:32.560 --> 43:35.640]  and the trap is set and they know they've got more than half the public on the
[43:35.640 --> 43:40.800]  dole and now they're moving in to destroy what's left of a free market
[43:40.800 --> 43:44.440]  and to take over the media and to censor the internet and to shut down
[43:44.440 --> 43:48.200]  freedom of speech and to decide who can have a car dealership who can have a
[43:48.200 --> 43:52.640]  factory it's all being announced it's all being done and it's not communism
[43:52.640 --> 43:54.280]  it's not socialism
[43:54.280 --> 43:55.360]  if you use those
[43:55.360 --> 43:58.040]  false terms that are only a hundred fifty years old
[43:58.040 --> 44:00.360]  if you want to use those terms
[44:00.360 --> 44:03.320]  carl march said that
[44:03.320 --> 44:06.800]  socialism then leads to communism in the withering away of the state it's the
[44:06.800 --> 44:08.320]  opposite
[44:08.320 --> 44:10.000]  communism
[44:10.000 --> 44:14.040]  socialism leads to communism leads to fascism
[44:14.040 --> 44:17.040]  you look at what china has today it's fascism you look at what the u.s. is
[44:17.040 --> 44:19.640]  having fascism england fascism
[44:19.640 --> 44:22.160]  it's fascism
[44:22.160 --> 44:25.760]  it's where a ruling elite control the government and control industry and
[44:25.760 --> 44:30.240]  control everybody's lives and the republicans will not tell you that they
[44:30.240 --> 44:33.680]  will not tell you the insurance companies ninety four percent of the lobbying
[44:33.680 --> 44:37.040]  money for this government takeover of health care they will not tell you the
[44:37.040 --> 44:40.520]  big banks and insurance companies are all lobbying to give the federal reserve
[44:40.520 --> 44:45.640]  unlimited power and lobbying for the vat and the sales taxes and the carbon
[44:45.640 --> 44:49.360]  taxes of course they're lobbying for it you heard glenn beck who admits he has
[44:49.360 --> 44:51.560]  dinner with bill gates and warren buffett
[44:51.560 --> 44:56.280]  both pushing this
[44:56.280 --> 44:59.840]  he's gonna sit up there and say man this we're gonna pay off the debt
[44:59.840 --> 45:01.440]  and one hundred percent of it
[45:01.440 --> 45:03.840]  in a constitutional convention
[45:03.840 --> 45:07.440]  which they could rewrite the whole constitution inside that
[45:07.440 --> 45:10.520]  that's why glenn beck is so bad as you'll sit there and tell you about the
[45:10.520 --> 45:12.000]  progressives at the low level
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.720]  tell you about the collectives tell you about other criminals he'll tell the
[45:14.720 --> 45:18.120]  truth about the illegals but then he gives you false solutions at the end of
[45:18.120 --> 45:23.600]  the day and that's why i'm forced to exposing very very dangerous
[45:23.600 --> 45:27.320]  because he's slick and he's intelligent he's an actor and he knows what he's
[45:27.320 --> 45:30.240]  doing
[45:30.240 --> 45:33.480]  so here we are now
[45:33.480 --> 45:36.400]  here we are with obama announcing
[45:36.400 --> 45:40.440]  that they're going ahead and put in the giant taxes for executive power outside
[45:40.440 --> 45:42.680]  of law on the
[45:42.680 --> 45:48.960]  cold powered plants that supply fifty plus percent of our power
[45:48.960 --> 45:52.960]  giant taxes on the cold mines
[45:52.960 --> 45:58.240]  which aren't passed on to the chinese will just ship it and lose our jobs
[45:58.240 --> 46:02.400]  giant taxes on electricity and the cities are all doing it and the states are
[46:02.400 --> 46:03.560]  all doing it
[46:03.560 --> 46:06.520]  austin two point six billion over the next three years they want a voice and
[46:06.520 --> 46:07.920]  just add on to your gas and
[46:07.920 --> 46:11.840]  electricity bill that's awesome energy that's just where i live that's a city
[46:11.840 --> 46:13.720]  of less than a million people
[46:13.720 --> 46:16.680]  metro it's more
[46:16.680 --> 46:20.600]  this is bondage two point six billion over three years is better than the whole
[46:20.600 --> 46:25.320]  city budget those three years and that money all goes out
[46:25.320 --> 46:27.120]  the private banks
[46:27.120 --> 46:30.160]  but don't worry glenbeck says we're gonna have a constitutional amendment to
[46:30.160 --> 46:35.840]  make sure one hundred percent of your tax money goes to the bankers
[46:35.840 --> 46:39.400]  but we'll get it paid down he says yeah just like they gave
[46:39.400 --> 46:41.480]  what in nineteen fifty six
[46:41.480 --> 46:43.400]  one billion dollars
[46:43.400 --> 46:45.120]  to nigeria
[46:45.120 --> 46:48.480]  and they've paid over fifty billion and they still owe another fifty billion
[46:48.480 --> 46:51.560]  that's pretty good you pay a hundred plus billion dollars on a one billion
[46:51.560 --> 46:53.200]  dollar loan
[46:53.200 --> 46:57.000]  oh yeah they're gonna pay it down in ten years and they're gonna cut the
[46:57.000 --> 47:00.840]  government aren't they
[47:00.840 --> 47:07.840]  you either get angry and realize that we're going in to feudalistic slavery
[47:09.520 --> 47:11.320]  and you overrun
[47:11.320 --> 47:13.840]  the neo-con talk show host
[47:13.840 --> 47:15.200]  who are giving cover
[47:15.200 --> 47:18.040]  to the globalist and you overrun the liberals
[47:18.040 --> 47:21.920]  and that's the good news in fact you guys reprint that for me
[47:21.920 --> 47:23.240]  i had it here in my
[47:23.240 --> 47:26.360]  stack and i'm having trouble finding it was that hill article
[47:26.360 --> 47:29.000]  about uh...
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.460]  forty percent of the tea party people being democrats and independence
[47:33.460 --> 47:35.040]  that's the big secret
[47:35.040 --> 47:39.160]  the democrats at the grass roots have finally figured out both parties are bad
[47:39.160 --> 47:42.560]  they finally figured out it's all a big scam
[47:42.560 --> 47:45.880]  that number is going to be sixty percent a year at the rate we're growing
[47:45.880 --> 47:48.360]  that's why they call it a right-wing racist tea party
[47:48.360 --> 47:51.400]  that's why they send in fox to take it over and make it a republican party
[47:51.400 --> 47:54.520]  event and they have fox nation and tea party nation
[47:54.520 --> 47:56.640]  funded by the rnc publicly
[47:56.640 --> 48:01.840]  so it is a republican event so that people can't get together
[48:01.840 --> 48:04.860]  and i've seen video all over the country around all supporters
[48:04.860 --> 48:06.680]  try to go to these events
[48:06.680 --> 48:10.000]  and point out and hand out films and hand out pamphlets and point out that
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.320]  republicans are for big government it's all a corporate takeover and those tea
[48:13.320 --> 48:15.160]  party people come up and beat
[48:15.160 --> 48:17.560]  them up
[48:17.560 --> 48:21.360]  and the liberal media the controlled liberals paradigm side of the media
[48:21.360 --> 48:24.520]  they never decry that
[48:24.520 --> 48:27.600]  they covered up when illegal aliens beat up tea party people
[48:27.600 --> 48:31.240]  but when tea party people beat up someone and stomp on them and jump on
[48:31.240 --> 48:32.960]  them and the police come over and help
[48:32.960 --> 48:34.840]  oh that's a good thing
[48:34.840 --> 48:37.080]  the tea parties are getting smart now
[48:37.080 --> 48:42.640]  media matter says they know how to deal with these ron paul people
[48:42.640 --> 48:43.960]  here's the hill
[48:43.960 --> 48:47.360]  survey four and ten tea party members are democrats or independents
[48:47.360 --> 48:48.600]  shattering
[48:48.600 --> 48:52.320]  the myth paul was in an article about it
[48:52.320 --> 48:55.400]  but they say oh it's bipartisan it's not bipartisan it's people that are on
[48:55.400 --> 48:58.920]  to your scam when they say bipartisan that still puts it in the republican
[48:58.920 --> 49:05.040]  democrat system
[49:05.040 --> 49:09.800]  valker carbon tax vat should be on the table wall street journal the u.s. should
[49:09.800 --> 49:13.280]  consider attacks on carbon or a value-added tax if it can't tackle the
[49:13.280 --> 49:17.120]  deficit what do you think the carbon tax is it's a vat on everything that has
[49:17.120 --> 49:20.000]  carbon involved when that's part of the life cycle and part of all human
[49:20.000 --> 49:21.640]  activity
[49:21.640 --> 49:24.360]  bill gates gets up and says we have to tax each human
[49:24.360 --> 49:27.280]  we have to reduce the number by half
[49:27.280 --> 49:30.840]  because humans are bad we're putting out this gas they picked the gas because you
[49:30.840 --> 49:34.360]  exhale it it makes you the enemy don't you get it
[49:34.360 --> 49:36.040]  they said this
[49:36.040 --> 49:38.360]  club of rome ninety one
[49:38.360 --> 49:42.560]  the u.s. should consider attacks on carbon or a value-added tax if it can't
[49:42.560 --> 49:46.800]  tackle the deficit by cutting government spending
[49:46.800 --> 49:48.760]  they're not going to cut government spending they're going to increase and
[49:48.760 --> 49:51.680]  they have former federal reserve chairman paul volker said an interview aired
[49:51.680 --> 49:53.880]  tuesday and wednesday on pbs
[49:53.880 --> 49:55.640]  i think if you can't do it
[49:55.640 --> 49:57.640]  on the cost side we've got to do
[49:57.640 --> 50:00.080]  on the revenue side and it's
[50:00.080 --> 50:02.480]  too early to do it but it's not too early
[50:02.480 --> 50:06.200]  to be wondering see they're just introducing acclimating you with
[50:06.200 --> 50:07.920]  conditioning
[50:07.920 --> 50:11.600]  all microchips everybody's gonna have a mobile you'll have to take a microchip
[50:11.600 --> 50:14.240]  from the pharmacy to make sure you're taking your pills right not abusing it
[50:14.240 --> 50:16.640]  everybody gets a microchip in their stomach now
[50:16.640 --> 50:18.360]  that's associated press all
[50:18.360 --> 50:20.960]  we gotta have troops on the streets you know that they're at the kandaki darby
[50:20.960 --> 50:22.560]  that's a super bowl there at nascar
[50:22.560 --> 50:25.880]  they're running checkpoints for d u i all we gotta have
[50:25.880 --> 50:28.920]  oh yeah i'm a lot of them are foreigners now but that's all we have we still
[50:28.920 --> 50:32.720]  gotta salute them you're not anti-military
[50:32.720 --> 50:36.560]  one possible approaches people talk about is a carbon tax tax on energy
[50:36.560 --> 50:38.720]  that's a big revenue producer if you're willing to do it
[50:38.720 --> 50:40.000]  not very
[50:40.000 --> 50:41.120]  popular
[50:41.120 --> 50:42.240]  to say the least
[50:42.240 --> 50:45.600]  but see they'll bankrupt things even further and hold his hostage and say

[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:06.080]  table on top of the income tax we'll be discussing that with dr. Paul Craig
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:11.560]  Roberts doc good to have you here with us well you've got the floor I mean why
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.840]  are you leaving why have you made this decision we're gonna we're gonna walk
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:19.880]  through it it says remind Alex that he wants to ask me about 9-11 Murrow
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:23.760]  office bombing Waco operation Northwood's JFK and we'll talk about the
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:28.760]  economy and the dying superpower so here you are you got the floor well Alex
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:36.680]  you you'd wanted me to explain why I would stop at the column and basically a
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:40.600]  bunch of things just came together one is I'm just tired I've been trying to
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:47.360]  save the country all my life the main thing is though I think I came to
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:56.600]  conclusion that that it's futile to write about what's happening to you know
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:03.640]  write about the wars the police state the lack of our civil liberties as long
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:12.320]  as the event that set those in motion itself can't be analyzed and of course
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:20.240]  we talk about 9-11 so it dawned on me that sites of which I was sort of a
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:29.560]  favorite columnist like anti-war comm a counter punch where I had a big
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:41.840]  following that neither side for example would would let me even present facts or
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:49.880]  even present the evidence that the scientists who claimed to have found
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:56.000]  nanothermite in the residue of the World Trade Center Thomas they wouldn't even
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  let me report that there were a thousand architects and engineers who had sent a
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:11.440]  petition to Congress demanding an investigation and so it made me realize
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:18.800]  that here were sites totally opposed to the war totally opposed to the police
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:23.520]  state and the loss of our civil liberties that sites who don't believe a word the
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:31.720]  government says about anything except 9-11 I got to thinking well what is the
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:40.160]  point of this how can you oppose the government when you give it the grounds
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:45.120]  on which it's acting so I came to conclusion that since 9-11 since it
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:54.160]  cannot be discussed you know in a few places like your site and and since
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:04:02.320]  people believe that they were attacked by Muslims and that we have to have police
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:08.320]  state powers to protect us from more tax there really nothing can be done and so
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:15.960]  I said it's futile and and important and then about that time I saw the latest
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:22.920]  polls that said 59% of the American people has three-fifths of the
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:33.560]  population are ready to go to war with Iran if they don't stop their peaceful
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:38.760]  nuclear energy program and I got to thinking well how can people come to
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:44.520]  this conclusion they've been lied to about weapons of mass destruction al
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:49.880]  k everything well doc stay there we got a break we're gonna come back and discuss
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:53.400]  this fact that 99% of the time the government's lying we know they're
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:58.160]  involved in every form of evil you can imagine Northwoods Gulf of Tonkin and

[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:14.160]  radio network Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is with us he just joined us the rest of
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:18.360]  the hour he's gonna do this interview and then one on tax day with us and then
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:23.560]  bow out perhaps forever he's not writing his column anymore he's been
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:28.480]  writing to a week for a very long time due to so much censorship out there in
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:31.920]  the media and things he's coming to this radio show because we don't censor
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:36.560]  anything we tell the truth justice be done may the heavens fall okay you were
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:40.960]  getting into the fact that we've been lied to so much so why do we believe the
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:45.640]  story with about 9-11 go ahead yeah you know it's an unbelievable story in
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:50.800]  fact you know if you just look anybody that looks at the World Trade Center
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:56.600]  towers for 15 seconds you realize these are not buildings falling down there's
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:01.600]  no sign of a building falling down they're blowing up and anybody that
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:05.160]  looks at it 15 seconds should be able to see the difference between a building
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:10.000]  that's falling down one's blowing up and so Americans can't even use their
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.040]  own eyes you see what I'm saying and then we have this fantasy figure shape
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:23.280]  Mohammed now you know they said that bin Laden was responsible but now it's
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:28.720]  this shape my head Mohammed the guy they waterboarded 183 times until he finally
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.320]  confessed to being the mastermind of 9-11 and if you look at this it makes
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:41.840]  no sense because look at this guy's feet shape my Hammond out with it all 16 U.S.
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:46.520]  intelligence agencies along with those of all U.S. allies including Israel's
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:52.680]  Mossad so no intelligence service on earth nor all of them combined was a
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:57.160]  match for shape Mohammed he out with it the National Security Council Dick
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:03.880]  Cheney the Pentagon State Department nor at US Air Force air traffic control he
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:07.760]  caused the airport security to fail four times in one morning he caused the
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:14.320]  state-of-the-art air defenses of the Pentagon to fail he he had people who
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:19.920]  couldn't buy planes pulling off fantastic flight feats he was able to do
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:28.320]  all of these things now he is more of a superhero than V in that movie V for
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:35.280]  vendetta nobody can do things like that nobody could pull off an operation like
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:41.000]  that that's just fantasy beyond fantasy and yet people have fallen for this so
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:47.720]  you realize you really just can't help people they can't think they can't see
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:53.400]  their own eyes now what also happens when you try to raise these questions for
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:57.080]  people even tells you they say oh our government would never kill its own
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:02.600]  citizens oh yeah what about Waco the branch
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:07.000]  division to a hundred men women and children that the government murdered
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:14.840]  no one was ever held accountable but they say oh well it was all the branch
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:20.600]  civilians bought but the government would never have a plot like 9-11 what
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:27.640]  about Operation Northwoods anybody can read about this this was a a plan designed
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:34.760]  by the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Lyman limitzer it was released by the
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:41.200]  Warren Commission after the Kennedy report it's available online but it's
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:45.360]  available in the National Security Archives you can read about it on
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:52.040]  Wikipedia it's everywhere here was an official plot by United States military
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:59.160]  and various black-off groups in the government to gun down American citizens
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:11.600]  in Miami in Washington DC to blow up boats of Cuban refugees to fabricate
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:18.960]  crashed airliners and to blame it all on Castro so they could invade Cuba this is
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:26.040]  a known thing that that we were prepared to do and this was you know like 60 a
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:34.040]  more year this was what 40 50 years ago when we allegedly were still somewhat of
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:39.240]  a freedom and democracy country and they were willing to do that then and
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:44.520]  Kennedy of course fires limits there and a lot of people believe that's why
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:50.440]  Kennedy was assassinated and then we have this very curious Murrah office
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:56.360]  building bombing Oklahoma City bombing that was pinned on McVeigh with his
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:04.800]  truck fertilizer bomb well it's General Parton who was head of Air Force
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:14.000]  munitions spent his life developing testing explosives with Air Force he
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:20.320]  put out a very thick report in which he said that that that building was blown
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:26.040]  up from the inside out and it most certainly was not blown up by truck
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:32.400]  bomb the truck bomb of that sort 60 feet away couldn't possibly have done the
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:40.400]  damage and produced the the outward explosions and then structural damage to
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:49.160]  those reinforced concrete columns so here was a real expert who put it on the
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:57.080]  line they had no impact whatsoever he sent it to the Congress he tried to talk
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:06.120]  to them it was just all deep six so what you have is a situation where it's
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:14.040]  impossible for experts even to bring facts not just the public attention but
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:18.000]  to the attention of people in government who are supposed to be overseeing the
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.760]  government such as the various congressional committee so when you have
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:28.920]  that type of a situation you know what what it has become of truth it's
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:37.480]  simply disappeared you can't it hasn't it can't even get into the arena where
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:45.080]  various material interests operate and so you have to ask yourself what
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:52.520]  are these columns for the people fall for anything the most absurd
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:58.880]  explanations and fantasies they accept as if they were actually real and yet
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:06.960]  they're completely deaf to experts the facts and so you can't help them and so
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:11.960]  that's really the main reason I quit at during the column I just came at the
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:19.440]  conclusion it was it was futile and the people are just so gullible well doctor
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:24.200]  let me throw something in here but I mean we don't need to lose all hope it did
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:28.480]  take time to expose Oklahoma City columns further back were blown off with
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:33.080]  blast points then columns right up beside the truck bomb that weren't even
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:37.200]  damaged part and pointed that out the local news showed them removing the
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:41.080]  bombs the governor said there were unexploded bombs inside the BATF showed
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:45.760]  up and told the medical workers patch us up like we were here minutes after it
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:49.840]  happened lying saying they were on the ninth floor Terrence Yeke local police
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:53.120]  officer that was a hero carried people out said it was all staged they
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:57.000]  murdered and tortured him going back to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed backing you up
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.440]  there he confessed to bombing buildings that weren't built till four years
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:06.400]  after he was incarcerated and even the hundred plus water boardings wouldn't
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:10.600]  make him lie and say he ran 9-11 so then they threatened to do stuff to his
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:15.520]  family and that's mainstream news so finally for his children he confessed to
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:20.840]  it but but it's a process and it was five percent won the Revolutionary War or
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:25.200]  less and just because they do have a large portion of the public like
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:29.680]  Congressman Johnson from Georgia who believes that islands float and that
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:32.400]  they're gonna capsize if there's too many people on them that's I mean you know
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:36.280]  a lot of dumb down people out there even in government it doesn't matter
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:40.400]  because your work and others work is really woken a lot of people up and I
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:43.760]  see a giant awakening happening and I don't blame you for quitting a twice a
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:49.920]  week twice a week column but I think that you've got a fighting spirit you
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:54.520]  should take some time off but I believe that you're gonna be back and that you're
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:57.840]  not gonna be able to control yourself even though you're 71 years old because
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:01.440]  you have liberty and love of the truth beating in your breast and you know we
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.680]  can't give up we know things will be much worse if we weren't here speaking
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:09.120]  out today so I want to commend you for all your work and I'm sorry that you were
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:12.800]  getting censored but we'll continue going through the points you wanted to
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:19.880]  make well well you know Alex you say it's public knowledge I mean it's
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:24.680]  available to the public they could know it but they don't I mean you know it I
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:29.400]  know it a few others know it and the people that they call kooks the 9
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:36.680]  11 9 11 skeptics but it's public knowledge only in the sense that it's
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:40.840]  available by the public doesn't know it and then we'll know it and if you try to
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:45.000]  tell them again well doctor let me stop you again you know you use a poll of
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.280]  57 percent wanting to attack Iran they have select demographics they can call
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:54.400]  I've commissioned polls before and I know you know about polls been in
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:59.320]  government and you know media a lot longer than I have but in the media I
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:04.520]  mean we've got an Angus and Reed New York Times poll from 2006 with 84 percent
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:10.280]  believing we've been lied to about 9 11 and so I don't trust some of these polls
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:15.120]  were saying well I agree with the polls could actually never even occur I mean
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:21.080]  I could see that the CIA or some government agency Pentagon goes to
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:26.320]  post and say here's a bunch of money give us this result is the result and
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:31.520]  that's entirely possible I mean I did it as I said my sound off article money has
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:37.840]  replaced everything and people will do anything for money live sheets deal and
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:43.480]  they do all the time and so you're completely right but let's assume that
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:49.880]  that people do know and they still do nothing about it they've got no way of
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:55.600]  doing anything about it the government doesn't represent them doesn't listen
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:02.880]  to them and in every sense they become irrelevant the government represents the
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:11.160]  powerful-minded interest groups that finance the political campaign and so
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:18.000]  the people are really even if we had them all educated and aware which I don't
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:28.160]  think we do still there's nothing short of arming themselves and rebellion there's
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.480]  no way they can impact or influence the government because paying attention to
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:37.120]  that we could care less about the people what's happening to them or what they
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:45.960]  think so it is a pretty bad situation stay there dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins

[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:12.720]  begun the enemy is afraid we're gonna win this thing ladies and gentlemen
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:16.880]  thanks to the work of people like dr. Paul Craig Roberts the fundamental
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:22.040]  situation we face is a decadent entertainment drunk culture who don't
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:26.720]  see themselves in the role of being informed or involved our numbers are
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:31.040]  much greater than many know because I'm here every day I see the numbers and I
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:37.400]  see the trend going up but the scientific dictatorship has set up Homeland
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:40.720]  Security in North com they want to push the American people into violent
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:46.920]  resistance so they can bring in a full tyranny we must resist we must speak out
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:52.480]  we must deprogram people and that's what we attempt to do here each and every day
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:56.960]  but they say there's a sign as you enter hell all those that enter here give up
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:02.720]  hope when we haven't reached hell yet but you know if dr. Roberts is being
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:07.840]  censored in his editorials by major publications and I think talk radio is
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:11.200]  the way to go and the mainstream media is imploding and losing all
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:15.320]  credibility because of the fact that the general public and major polls trust
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:18.720]  the alternative media a lot more than they trust the mainstream media so there
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:23.960]  is hope but I do think it's important that we do realize that we are in dire
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:32.400]  straits here dr. Roberts yeah we are we're in dire straits and I still think
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:37.640]  that people are not aware of their insomnia and look thank you think about
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:46.480]  the we covered you know the you know the Mac Bay Ocomb city bombing 9-11
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:50.640]  operation northwards but just think about the Kennedy assassination I think when
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:54.560]  when the black ops groups got away with that that's what kind of sealed our fate
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:26:01.520]  and the liberals let them get away with it because with with the election of
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:09.120]  Kennedy you see the liberals had overcome the Eisenhower Republicans and
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:13.880]  we're now going to use the government to do great things they're going to use the
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:18.680]  government to great things the American people and remakes us out in maybe more
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:25.080]  fair and just and all this so they couldn't possibly let it out that the
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:31.240]  government it killed Prone so they concocted another fantasy story about
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:41.400]  how Oswald with the worthless rifle shot Kennedy from behind and killed him
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:46.440]  with a magic bullet that also wounded Connolly and did all kinds of
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:52.360]  improbable things and yet all the evidence is that Kennedy was hit from the
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:56.080]  right front to hit the right front temple blew out the back of his head you
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:02.040]  can see that in the films that tourists took and you can see Jackie his wife
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:06.640]  crawling out on the trunk of the limo to recover the back part of his skull that
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:10.920]  you've just seen blown out from the front you know the bullet hitting the
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:16.080]  front blowing out all these things are are available and then they get this
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:19.640]  patch of Oswald and before he can ever be questioned
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:26.240]  Jack Ruby is somehow with a gun inside a jail where he doesn't belong he has no
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:31.280]  right to be inside the jail much less with a gun and he shoots Oswald inside
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:39.800]  the jail and yet people still fall for the Warren Commission report which has
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:44.320]  been disproved over and over and over and over by expert after expert after
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:55.920]  expert and yet we still have this sort of mythology of of Oswald kill Kennedy
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:00.560]  and then even after all the evidence finally forced the congressional
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:08.440]  committee to look at it again and you had all these witnesses who saw a gunman
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:17.480]  at the grassy Noel shoot and so what does the what do they do finally well the
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:22.800]  Congress issues the report well there was a second gunman another loner
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:31.200]  another deranged loner so we have two deranged loners operating independently
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:36.160]  of one another both decided to shoot Kennedy on the same day the same place
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:42.640]  now how can anybody believe and yet they do and you're talking about the 79
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:50.960]  report where they said a 98% chance that it was a conspiracy well you know they
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:57.640]  counter the conspiracy sort of well maybe I don't remember exactly right but I
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:05.600]  thought conspiracy kind of disappeared by the by the final conclusion that it
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:11.000]  was a second the lone gun yeah they inserted that in there yeah somebody
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:18.920]  did it so basically the government seems to be able to do whatever he wants and
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:28.160]  I don't I can't say the government some there's some parts of the gun the secret
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:31.160]  team that Fletcher Proudie talked about the former head of Black Ops at the
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:34.960]  Pentagon stay there long segment coming up we're gonna finish up with Kennedy
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:40.520]  let's get into some other subjects and talk about the economy fresh off their

[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:44.000]  other publications as one of the top ten living economists and I was talking
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.840]  about Kennedy cutting taxes between 50 and 30 percent depending on which tax it
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:53.400]  was he said basically that's correct and more money came in the government knows
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:58.000]  this you cut taxes and the economy starts racing but it's the free market
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.960]  main street economy and and the big central banks don't want that they
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:06.600]  want to control vertically integrated economy and they want to impoverish
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:09.960]  people it's the third world rule where you have more billionaires in Mexico we
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:13.600]  have here in the u.s. but one of the poorest populations in the world so I
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:17.200]  want to encourage everyone to understand what's happening and it's all

[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:14.600]  going back to dr. Paul Craig Roberts we've been having very interesting
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:17.360]  discussions behind the scenes I want to get into the economy but first going
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:21.840]  back to violent revolution they've now framed it that even if you defend
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:26.680]  yourself when cps without due process is snatching your kid dying core runs
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:30.280]  many of the systems in the states convicted white slavery traffickers
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:35.400]  that's Chicago Tribune AP if you resist them taking your farm you're a
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:39.920]  terrorist they clearly have set up this system now we have the homeland security
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:42.960]  internal documents where they admit homeland security is set up for the
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:47.440]  american people so we where do you see this going because they're they're not
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:51.560]  going to implement any real reforms this is by design in my opinion and I mean
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:57.640]  where is it going well there is the police state that's that's been obvious
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:01.400]  since the you know like the second year the bush administration where we used
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:07.920]  to talk about it if you remember you know when you do interviews where is it
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:18.000]  going I it's a look the local police now are militarized if you go to a gun
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.440]  club all the police will be there they got automatic weapons they'll be out
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:29.000]  they'll be 20 30 40 50 of them and they're practicing mass fire and what's
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:36.440]  it all about it's it's for controlling the people who pay their salaries so the
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:44.400]  whole thing is it's set up to prevent any kind of opposition from the
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:50.320]  population and it's like you say they can they can now declare anybody to be a
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:57.760]  terrorist and therefore they can confiscate not just your life and rights
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:03.640]  but all your assets so it's a police state people don't are not aware of this
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:11.480]  they they still think the government is there to protect them in some way I get
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:15.640]  a lot of emails from people who are already suffering these types of
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:21.520]  intrusions where they've read my book you know about how the law has been
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:27.160]  destroyed and they wonder what they can do of course they haven't got any rights
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:36.440]  so they can't do anything so you know I don't know how much of it is a plan with
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:41.560]  a direct goal in mind or how much of it is just the police agencies grabbing
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:50.560]  power and of course it doesn't much matter because under either system we're
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:55.680]  we've lost our rights and it's very hard for people even if they if they're
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:38:02.840]  organized and have weapons and to resist because the kinds of weapons the
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:09.400]  police and military have I mean you know they have military weapons and so the
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:13.960]  kinds of weapons people ever feeble and now under north come we have the
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:18.240]  military everywhere conditioning the public at DWI checkpoints at the
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:22.800]  Kentucky Derby at football games searching children running checkpoints on
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:28.720]  the highways an armed camp drilling and training to go after us I want to
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:33.240]  cover one other issue before we get into the economy Dr. Roberts have you seen
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:37.600]  the gun camera footage from three years ago in Iraq that WikiLeaks released a
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:41.360]  few days ago they said they've got scores of these videos they're going to be
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:45.960]  releasing where they are killing the killing the people and shooting the
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:50.160]  kids in the minivan trying to get a wounded reporter off the street and
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:54.440]  secondarily I get these emails it's a minority of emails saying how dare you
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:58.880]  criticize our troops this is a war well yeah this is a war that was built on
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:03.760]  lies and WMD's we go invade the country we kill over a million of them and then
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:08.920]  there's this droning brainwashed message that we've got to support the troops by
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:14.000]  keeping them in two three four five six tours and treating them like garbage
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.440]  when they get back and it's just this mindless supposed patriotism to worship
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:23.400]  tyranny it's it's very reminiscent of what happened in Nazi Germany yes that's
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:27.160]  right you know I their brown shirts I've been calling them brown shirts for years
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:35.880]  and you've described it accurately that's exactly the situation and it's
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:42.240]  another reason that I thought writing for these people is pointless I mean I
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:49.600]  can't I can't fathom the danger that they're in and many of them of course
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:54.000]  are still fighting the the Vietnam war they're still angry that we didn't win
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.120]  the war but suppose we had one and what would be any different the whole thing
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:06.320]  is it's some form of emotional infantilism they're people who are still
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:13.400]  three years old and they they're they're ruled by some sort of blind emotions
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:19.840]  that's incapable of thought they can't even take in facts so talking to them
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:26.360]  is a waste of time but well it is arrested development they're very
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:30.960]  childlike facts mean nothing and it's this petty power trip that they're part
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:35.280]  of the state they're part of the system they're winners but that very system is
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:38.760]  destroying their future as well and as you know someone's research history
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:43.000]  once you give into one big lie that it's a bigger lie a bigger lie and then
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.680]  things accelerate at the end and you agree that we're now reaching that
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:51.280]  acceleration point where all of this preparatory slide into tyranny and
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:56.600]  corruption has seemed fast but we ain't seen nothing yet yes that that's true
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:00.480]  and if you look at it at the complexity of the federal courts even the Supreme
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:06.600]  Court I mean how quiet they've been and tolerant of this and the law schools and
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:12.400]  the law deans and the bar association and the law firms wherever you look is
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:19.440]  just acceptance there's essentially acceptance of this and you would have
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:23.960]  thought that that all the prestigious law schools would be on the high horse the
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:27.920]  bar association people would be screaming what are you doing you can't
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:33.120]  destroy civil liberties on the basis of the hoax but that's exactly what's
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:38.160]  happening and people are accepting and they just try to find some way to make
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:43.040]  money out of it you know well the point I make is all these people that
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:52.240]  dehumanize Iraqis or Afghans or others or the Serbs or the South Ossetians they
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:57.560]  have to understand that in 100% of the time in history when you get sucked in
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:04.800]  by an imperial spirit of evil and it's like a team spirit once you do that it's
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:12.360]  always visited on you it always comes back the system has a desire and they
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:16.680]  will carry it out on all of these people that have gone along with it and you
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:21.720]  got all this well look what happened to Hitler's brown shirts first thing you
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:26.240]  did when you had real powers turned on the brown shirts and destroy them they
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:30.160]  were all killed arrested don't you remember that I mean this is one of the
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:34.280]  key things in the not in the Nazi history that the brown shirts that
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:39.520]  marched through the streets for Hitler and you know attacked all the Jews the
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:44.120]  crystal-knocked all of that stuff all of this this violent crowd the first thing
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:49.800]  illa did was eliminate them so you're exactly right that's exactly what
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:55.000]  happens well that's what Stalin did look what Stalin did to the Bolsheviks the
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.800]  Bolsheviks made the revolution so he eliminated because they know how to get
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:03.280]  things done that's in their handbook you know people really don't know this but
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:07.760]  it's a fact Mao was basically put on house arrest the last few years of his
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:12.560]  life his wife was arrested and the communists then scapegoated him and he
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:16.520]  was certainly part of it for all of their evil so they come to full power and
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:21.800]  have giant purges and they even flush the top people down the toilet that's
[01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:27.840]  right that's exactly that's exactly that once it starts that it and then of
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:31.560]  course the place have to prove that they're on the government side and the
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:36.320]  way you do that you're you always producing new terrorists or new enemies
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:39.960]  of the people or you know the KGB under Stalin they used to have what they
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:44.800]  call street sweeps the officers would just grab the street and rest to
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:51.320]  everybody on the street by the way we went to the gulag wow two weeks ago a
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:56.240]  bunch of articles came out the same time about police admitting quotas and not
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:00.880]  just for parking tickets or speeding but to just arrest people and federal
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:04.360]  marshals have come out and said they're meant to put people on terror list for
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:08.200]  no reason in the airports and that there are quotas to create the perception
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:13.600]  that there are all these criminals right exactly it I mean it's out of control I
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:18.880]  think it's you emphasize it's out of control I don't know whether they have
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:24.240]  any kind of specific plan that they're implementing step-by-step I don't think
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:30.520]  things happen that way I think it's just people bullies people who won't power
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:34.600]  they see opportunities to get it they grab it well I agree with you doctor but
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:39.160]  there's a national law enforcement think tank counsel and Arte Sveida takes
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:43.880]  blood without warrants total police state shuts down gun shows without any law
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:48.440]  just thuggishly just does it under Fed control and it turns out he was picked
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:52.280]  by the feds from California brought here and is now the frontrunner for Dallas
[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:57.320]  and this secretive National Council is telling Dallas to hire him and then if
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:03.160]  they do federal funds come in yeah well I'm not in the least I'm not the least
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:08.960]  surprised we're running out of time for the economy you want to do anything on
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:13.360]  that absolutely sir in fact in fact let's get into the carbon tax the value
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:21.440]  added where all this is going okay you ready yes sir all right what they're
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:27.520]  coming up with these taxes because they have bankrupted the federal treasury and
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:36.440]  course states and this is endangering the dollar and if the dollar cracks their
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:40.600]  power goes with it I mean what could really what would stop the American
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:45.520]  Empire and its tracks would be the failure of the dollar is reserved
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:50.160]  currency because that's what American power is based on it's not based on
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:56.480]  anything else it's based on the dollar is reserved currency so their bank
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:02.440]  billouts and their wars to produce such massive deficits that they cannot be
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:09.840]  financed by world savings and so I mean even if the other countries were still
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:14.520]  willing to buy the trade rebonds there's just not enough world savings to
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:19.160]  finance the United States government deficit so they they they have the
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:23.240]  dollar in danger and their powers in danger so they got to find some new
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:28.520]  tax revenues and so that's what the very added tax is about because it's like a
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:34.880]  sales tax you you can't avoid it except by not purchasing and if you don't buy
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:43.160]  anything then you you don't have to pay that tax now the carbon tax in my
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:50.360]  opinion is is just another charade that the corporations came up with because
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:55.760]  it lets them buy and sell the right to pollute so they can they can turn
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:47:02.800]  environmental damaging action pollution into a profit-making venture so that's
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:08.120]  what the carbon tax does and the corporations of course all in favor
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:14.440]  of it because they can now buy it buy it and sell it and Wall Street wants it
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:18.040]  because they'll turn it into derivatives you know the right to pollute
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:25.760]  but it becomes valuable and so that's that's what that that's what that's
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:31.880]  about it so what what happened so here we have the American people the middle
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:37.960]  class is essentially destroyed because they've been no new middle-class jobs no
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:44.000]  net new middle-class jobs in a decade so all the people who graduate college and
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:50.840]  have hopes and all that there's nothing for them to do and engineers can't find
[01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:59.160]  work so they they they close this down there's no growth in the income of the
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:02.640]  average American except for the one percent super rich whose income is
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:09.360]  growing phenomenally so there's no income growth people have lost their jobs the
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:17.840]  real unemployment rate is around 22% so you have all these people out of work
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:25.720]  losing their homes and now they want to make them pay a very added tax so the
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:33.640]  effect of all this is to drive the people into the ground it's it's it's
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:38.640]  most destructive thing that you can do you drive them into the ground you make
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:48.400]  them more desperate right now you know you there's still some fat in the system
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:52.760]  some parents still have money the kids can come live at home even though they
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:49:03.680]  got college degrees but all of that drains away and so this is probably the
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:10.800]  first time in history where a government has intentionally destroyed its own
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:17.600]  population the economic prospects of American people are being destroyed by
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:24.440]  the government that they elect they think represents them and has their best
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:32.960]  interest at heart so this is a phenomenal development as well it it's just as
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:42.080]  extraordinary as the criminal actions of the government in creating terrorist
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:50.840]  events that then let it launch wars against the rest of the world they have
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:56.920]  a term for it command destruction and it vertically integrates the economy
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:01.040]  accelerates the power of the super rich but destroys the engine of wealth
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:06.000]  development but when you look at Maurice Strong in 1992 and you look at what all
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.040]  these other environmentalists have said and you look at the head of NASA
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:15.360]  climatology he says it is our job this is a credo a maximum to destroy the
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:23.200]  industrial society and this is feudalism this is absolute despotism yes
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:31.160]  I think I think that's true the real the real question is is what can the United
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:35.760]  States government do about China and Russia let's talk about that we come
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:38.600]  back doctor final segment I'll see if I can twist your arm for another five
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:41.400]  because I realized this is one of our last interviews with you at least for a
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:45.960]  long time you said you wanted to come on a tax day that was a great idea so we'll

[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:17.120]  outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that

[01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:16.560]  breakdown tell folks about your latest book well it's how the economy was
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:26.280]  lost it tells how the offshoring of jobs for example has prevented the growth
[01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:30.640]  of middle-class jobs for over a decade and has suppressed the growth of
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:35.800]  American incomes and made the economy totally dependent on debt expansion
[01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:39.280]  which is now of course ruined everyone because they can't pay their debts that
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:49.560]  isn't your home and it also then discusses the whole hoax of free trade
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:55.320]  you know the free trade cloak for offshoring it has offshoring is not
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:55:01.280]  free trade is not any kind of trade it's lay barbitrides and I also discussed
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:08.880]  the failures of the most impressive failures in economic theory in the
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:15.840]  games that economists play to hide the defects and their models that are
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:22.800]  helping us move along the road to economic Armageddon so it's all written
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:31.560]  in very accessible languages no formulas no arcane words and since anybody can
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:43.320]  read it it certainly is a good offset to the kind of disinformation that they
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:49.440]  get from the financial news well doc in the time we've got left
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:54.280]  geopolitically with the different power blocks that are out there you were
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:56:01.080]  getting into China well you know they there's no doubt that the United States is
[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:06.680]  on a hegemonic path it was to be the world hegemon you know you approach it
[01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:12.120]  various ways the new world order and plan the world government and so forth but
[01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:18.040]  there's no indication whatsoever that Russia or China is on this path or would
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:24.480]  go along with it and so the question is how what does the United States go but
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:34.280]  they do about Russia and China because they are clearly obstacles to American
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:40.240]  domination of the world and now Russia is relatively weak but it has the
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:46.480]  unlimited number of nuclear missiles it blows up many times over and of course
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:53.920]  the Chinese economy now is in terms of industry manufacturing it greatly
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:59.680]  surpasses the United States economy I mean there's steel production for example
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:05.760]  many times how is there heavy equipment the manufacturing advanced
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:13.920]  technology we we're a second-rate economy compared to Chinese industry and
[01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:19.320]  manufacturing so how can we show them aside of course they're also our biggest
[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:25.040]  predator well we know how they plan that emergency encourages stand as police
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:30.880]  firearm protesters the CIA is admittedly in all the major stands it's in Georgia
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:36.400]  it's in circling China and financing rebels to attack these countries and
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:40.880]  that's why the communist Chinese are getting hopping mad well you're right
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:46.680]  that's what the CIA is doing but the Russians and the Chinese unlike the
[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:53.040]  American people are aware of it and I don't think they'll sit there and
[01:57:53.040 --> 01:58:01.520]  definitely passively and so something they're likely to do something and both
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:08.080]  of them have various powerful responses that they could make I mean short of
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:15.680]  military attack so the Russians can cut Europe off from natural gas in fact the
[01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:20.840]  Russians could put could punish severely these various stands that we're
[01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:26.640]  now operating in the former constituent parts of the Soviet Union and then the
[01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:32.360]  Chinese it certainly caused us a lot of financial worries don't stay there stay
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:36.640]  there we're coming right back after this quick break I'm Alex Jones info wars

[01:59:53.040 --> 02:00:00.680]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:19.760]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:25.720]  Alex Jones we'll cover the situation in Kurdistan after Dr. Roberts leaves us
[02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:29.000]  here in about five minutes but a bunch of other news we're gonna be going over
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:33.800]  Emmerger open the phones up but going back to Dr. Roberts during the break I
[02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:38.360]  was making the point you see you got to say that on air that normal people like
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:43.360]  himself or myself we like a bonfire and a pretty view and our wife there our kids
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:47.560]  there a glass of beer but psychopaths like Hitler he would go to the front and
[02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:51.160]  watch burning buildings and war for hours they love dead bodies they love
[02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:54.640]  destruction and we were talking about how it's now come out and been admitted
[02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:58.600]  that Cheney wanted to start nuclear war with Russia I guess to stay in power or
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:03.560]  something and that on 888 I mean the and that same group is still in control
[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:09.280]  with Obama I mean we're dealing with real psychopaths Dr. Roberts yes they're
[02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:15.320]  insane people but the United States government is in the grip of insane
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:22.760]  people and I don't get saying they're evil and in fact they're probably the
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:29.040]  most evil that they've ever had their hands on the government and American
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:34.280]  people having a clue they've no they've no clue at all they've no clue what's in
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:42.440]  store for them and this this kind of and it's because no one was ever held
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:49.080]  accountable so you know in her murder mysteries Agatha Christie the famous
[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:55.520]  English you know detective novelist she makes the point that when a murder when
[02:01:55.520 --> 02:02:01.080]  a murderer kills the first person he then finds it easier to kill the second
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:04.920]  third and the fourth and the more he kills the easier he gets you know for
[02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:11.480]  him to be taking lies and I think this is what we see happening with our
[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:16.720]  government they they've gotten away with so many things there's never been any
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:25.480]  accountability and that now they're just reckless and this is what I I say
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:31.360]  that it makes you wonder what will be the consequence of the recklessness of
[02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:35.960]  the United States government when there's a nuclear arms Soviet Union and
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:42.320]  China and moreover a China with a powerful economy and and financial power
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:48.280]  over the United States so the recklessness we could see the United
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:53.440]  States government you know doing the same thing it looked at it he marched off
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:03:02.560]  into Russia destroyed itself and how will our destruction come about and he
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:06.400]  destroyed 20 million Germans in the process you're coming back for an
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:11.880]  hour on the 15th we'll talk about your ideas for solutions here but it's the
[02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:17.440]  night TV it's it's the naive level of the American people because we're too
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:21.240]  good we're Americans and I think is allowed this absolute evil to grow I
[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:26.960]  think that's that's true because the American people can accept what their
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:31.640]  eyes and ears should be telling them and so the government never gets held
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:36.320]  accountable and of course elections don't matter because it's the same group
[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:42.200]  and Marston no matter who gets elected to office it's always the same interest
[02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:49.080]  that controls so that's the what happens when there's no when there's no
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:55.360]  accountability and and when the people who actually have a moral conscience and
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:59.480]  try to do something they all get attacked and discredit them you look at the
[02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:04.800]  attack on the pope and the Catholic Church one way to see that whatever you
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:09.360]  think of the pope the Catholic Church that they are a moral voice in way but
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:15.280]  when you discredit that voice then who can complain if the United States

[02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:30.360]  also sad interview with dr paul crack roberts is a wonderful person
[02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:34.680]  i haven't commented in the last few weeks on the situation with the catholic
[02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:38.760]  church i have meant to i am not a catholic i am
[02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:42.120]  non-denominational but i have a lot of catholic friends and i find they're
[02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:45.560]  great people when i've been out protesting years ago
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:48.760]  abortion clinics it was almost all catholics out there
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:52.920]  and you will know them by their fruits now that said we sell a video lamp in
[02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:57.400]  the dark exposing the incredible corruption of the catholic church
[02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:01.320]  it's just like i expose israel for staging terror attacks because it's in
[02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:05.880]  the jerusalem potes and herets i mean just google
[02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:09.960]  israel admits they created fake al qaeda every time there's about to be a
[02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:12.760]  peace deal they activate them does that mean there aren't real
[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:17.400]  terrorist groups no the point is israel has been caught doing this i cover it
[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:22.040]  it doesn't mean i hate israel i cover the corruption of the catholic church it
[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:24.680]  doesn't mean i hate catholics when pat robertson
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:28.200]  who's a supposedly a protestant comes out with global warming ads saying we've
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:32.360]  got to have global taxes with al sharpton i criticize him not because i don't
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:36.840]  like protestants but because i don't like what pat robertson's doing when he said
[02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:40.120]  10 years ago that china was quote doing what it had to do
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:45.960]  with extreme abortion and infanticide and birth control for forced birth control
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:50.440]  he said they had to do it and he did more aggressive family planning
[02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:54.920]  and i'm a protestant but i'm criticizing him what the media does though as you
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:58.360]  say we've got 30 million illegal aliens in this country it's bankrupting all the
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:00.840]  states the government wants to bring them in as a voting block
[02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:03.480]  a lot of them are criminals that are coming up here to escape justice in
[02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:08.280]  mexico the media says racist to get us all divided so we can't have a real
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:10.760]  debate about this or i don't want the government running
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:14.440]  health care it's a boondoggle for insurance companies and will be a new tax
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:18.440]  shut up racist remember the media saying that over and over again
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:22.360]  naming me by name and others ron paul and others it's just nothing to do with it
[02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:27.720]  but what does that have to do with it so we can't have a real debate now
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:31.960]  i've explained this many times from studying history and all levels of
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:37.320]  government throughout the last 500 years at least
[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:40.920]  even goes back more than that in western europe it it happens everywhere for
[02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:44.840]  some reason criminal groups whether they're drug
[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:50.120]  dealers or thieves or whatever or pedophiles they like to get into
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:53.080]  government positions because they can protect themselves and do whatever they
[02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:55.720]  want they can get away with it because now they
[02:10:55.720 --> 02:10:59.880]  have authority and the people they abuse or kill
[02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:03.080]  you know it's their word against the person with power so most people are
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:06.920]  scared to go after the groups with power and so that's why criminals and
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:11.000]  psychopaths and sadists all team up together
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:14.600]  and so we've had many guests on over the years exposing
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:18.760]  the fact that a large percentage i wouldn't say the majority from our
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:23.720]  studies but 35 maybe more percent of catholic
[02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:28.440]  leadership worldwide the africa asia latin america
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:33.160]  north america england it doesn't matter australia
[02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:38.120]  they are caught you get one pedophile in he moves up through the parish
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:46.600]  he then recruits his lovers in who also like children and they set up a kingdom
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:52.600]  of course when i set out studying this 16 years ago 17 years ago been on air for
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:55.960]  more than 14 i only saw it after the truth
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:59.880]  in history books and government documents and i kept running into
[02:11:59.880 --> 02:12:03.800]  police departments that are run by pedophiles cps departments that are run
[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:08.120]  by pedophiles truancy departments that are run by pedophiles
[02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:13.640]  dinecore filled with pedophiles the un filled with pedophiles i mean
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:16.760]  you can just google or search engine the term un
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:20.440]  child slavery rings un child sex slaves
[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:25.480]  un diplomats child sex slaves us diplomats child sex slaves

[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.880]  but we're simulcasting at prism planet dot tv
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:42.920]  uh go to go to google or whatever search engine you want and type in
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:50.360]  dinecore child sex trafficking or sex trafficking and you will get ap
[02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:54.920]  roiders chicago tribune but it it comes out here and there but never becomes a
[02:12:54.920 --> 02:13:00.680]  big news cycle on cnn and fox okay dinecore international
[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:04.120]  there it is dinecore haliburton sex slave scandal won't go away that's
[02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:07.960]  prismplanet.com and then it has links to the ap
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:11.480]  in fact print me a bunch of those i know you printed them a few days ago we had
[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:15.160]  catherine austin fits on and she sent me emails saying you didn't know
[02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:19.880]  dinecore runs many of the cps units in the country
[02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:23.640]  and then i went and i found out my god i didn't know they were running
[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:28.200]  in some states the majority of it and they've been caught there
[02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:32.040]  and i know that it came out they were running these operations with hundreds
[02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:35.160]  of thousands of children and women per year
[02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:42.120]  western europe eastern europe africa middle east asia
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:46.440]  i mean it's so huge and my point is this
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:49.240]  why are we only hearing about the catholic church
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:54.200]  because from my study the united nations in fact google united nations child
[02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:57.320]  sex abuse and and and you know barbecuing
[02:13:57.320 --> 02:14:00.440]  children over fires i mean folks you can do the research yourself
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:04.040]  it is just unbelievable
[02:14:04.040 --> 02:14:06.920]  and follow through those articles because i want to get ap in roiders i don't
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:09.240]  want to just show our boil down store people say oh that's not prism
[02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:13.240]  you know prismplanet info wars no i mean if you guys printed it
[02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:17.080]  what fits was on monday or tuesday monday
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:21.080]  yeah and and and you guys find found me roiders ap and chicago tribune
[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:27.320]  in fact that's over in this stack but the point is this is real and yes the
[02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:32.600]  catholic church covered this up because it goes right to the top
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:37.160]  uh rat singer uh you know was involved covering this
[02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:40.760]  stuff up 30 years ago that's confirmed and the establishment is in some
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:44.360]  internal war blackmailing the vatican over something the vatican's
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:46.840]  criticizing abortion they're criticizing wars
[02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:51.640]  they're criticizing israel for whatever reason this is the only group
[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:58.440]  that is being exposed and you've got a us media
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:03.400]  yeah there's chicago tribune us stalls on human trafficking pentagon has yet to
[02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:07.560]  ban contractors from using forced labor and that's literally tens of
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:11.720]  thousands of slaves in that article from 2005 but you but you can also search
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:18.440]  one chicago tribune dinecorp child trafficking and it'll come up
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:24.920]  so so my issue is why are they only covering the catholic church and they
[02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:28.520]  should be but they should also be covering the
[02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:31.320]  texas youth commission in facilities all over the state
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:34.520]  where they were the parking lots would fill up at night with people coming in
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:39.000]  to have sex with the kids that have been cps'd or the kids in juvenile
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:43.400]  they even had paid gladiatory fights where they would have a fight with
[02:15:43.400 --> 02:15:46.360]  weapons uh for betting i mean these are like
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:52.680]  treated like game cocks or animals and so that's my issue here
[02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:57.560]  is that how many republican leaders how many democratic leaders barney frank
[02:15:57.560 --> 02:16:03.000]  was caught repeatedly with underage male prostitutes 15 16 17
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.480]  years old out of a georgetown complex
[02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:10.120]  he didn't get in trouble because he gave a press conference and said if you don't
[02:16:10.120 --> 02:16:13.160]  back off until the fbi to stop now and it was confirmed it was happening
[02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:16.600]  he said i'm going to tell you what's really going on and they shut up
[02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:20.920]  instantly congressman foley caught doing this stuff
[02:16:20.920 --> 02:16:24.200]  how many cps workers how many times you see it in the back of the paper
[02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:30.360]  where the local homeland security head was caught you know molesting children
[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:33.400]  or flying in airplanes to meet with people that are going to sell them a
[02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:37.400]  kid when i tell you i mean you heard dr paul
[02:16:37.400 --> 02:16:41.800]  craig roberts head of the treasury you know editor at
[02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:44.760]  wall street journal father ergonomics saying
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:48.600]  and he wouldn't like this five years ago on the show he's now been educated
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:52.520]  saying the greatest evil in history is now in control of our government
[02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:59.240]  the greatest most sophisticated evil and so how do these people work together
[02:16:59.240 --> 02:17:04.280]  globally it's a network of perverts it's a network of pedophiles
[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:08.440]  and that's just one group of them others
[02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:14.920]  like to brutalize women savagely viciously uh when you see movies like
[02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:22.360]  hostile produced by quentin tarantino i have seen scores of articles
[02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:27.320]  in the times of london in in in british papers and in french papers
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:32.040]  i mean i remember one in burgundy france this woman escaped from a castle
[02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:35.080]  that was owned by one of the richest people in france
[02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:39.560]  she weighed less than 85 pounds like a concentration camp victim
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:44.120]  she got to the local state police office they went to the castle and found a
[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:47.960]  bunch of dead women in cages and it was just shut down nothing was going to be
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:51.720]  done i mean every day i read about some
[02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:56.760]  little girl on her bicycle disappears and the cia loads them on planes
[02:17:56.760 --> 02:18:01.240]  dinecore loads them on and they just do this is who does it
[02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:06.680]  and the cps hunts children the cps has bounties on kids that look a certain
[02:18:06.680 --> 02:18:10.120]  way they wait at the city owned hospitals with poor people who were
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:13.480]  having blonde-haired blue-eyed kids those can go for 500 grand it goes
[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:18.040]  through an adoption agency goes to the person that wants them
[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:21.960]  and of course these criminals that run things they then use their own system
[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:25.560]  as a persecution arm against the public
[02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:29.480]  most of the sex offenders and the registries now were caught urinating
[02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:33.080]  behind their car in fact the president even talked
[02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:36.920]  about that with america's most wanted individual

[02:18:46.280 --> 02:18:50.360]  i mean some places in texas it may be a hundred miles to a gas station
[02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:54.200]  and every one of us is guilty of the crime of being a human and pulling over
[02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:58.760]  walking over to the bar bar fence getting behind a bush and urinating
[02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:06.440]  nope that is a sex crime uh the majority is made up of those people

[02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:30.840]  mr we play this video but here's the here's the text mr secretary i watched
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:34.840]  president bush deliver a moving speech at the united nations in september 2003 in
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:38.280]  which he mentioned the crisis of the sex trade the president called for the
[02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:41.320]  punishment of those involved in the horrible business but the very moment
[02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:44.280]  of the speech dying core was exposed for having been involved in the buying and
[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:47.640]  selling of young women and children while all of this was going on dying core
[02:26:47.640 --> 02:26:50.920]  kept the pentagon contract to administer the smallpox and anthrax
[02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:53.880]  vaccines and is now working on a plague vaccine to the joint

[02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:08.280]  thank you representative first the answer to your first question is no
[02:27:08.280 --> 02:27:11.720]  absolutely not the policy united states government is clear unambiguous and
[02:27:11.720 --> 02:27:15.480]  opposed the activities you described the second question
[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:19.480]  mckinney well how do you explain the fact that dying core and its successor
[02:27:19.480 --> 02:27:23.480]  companies have received and continue to receive government contracts rumsfeld
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:27.320]  i would have to go and find the facts but there are laws and rules and
[02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:30.440]  regulations with respect to government contracts and there are times that
[02:27:30.440 --> 02:27:33.800]  corporations do things that they should not oh it's just very just something
[02:27:33.800 --> 02:27:39.080]  they shouldn't do in which case they tend to be uh suspended for a period
[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:43.320]  there are times that that the under the laws and the rules and regulations
[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:46.840]  for the passed by the congress implemented by the executive branch that
[02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:51.640]  corporations can get off of out of the penalty box if you
[02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:54.920]  will and will be permitted to engage in contracts with the government
[02:27:54.920 --> 02:27:58.520]  they're generally not barred in perpetuity mckinney that's correct this
[02:27:58.520 --> 02:28:02.920]  company was never in the penalty box she says this
[02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:05.960]  contract this company was never in the penalty box rumsfeld
[02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:10.600]  i'm advised by dr chew that it was not the corporation that was engaged in
[02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:13.400]  the activities you characterized but i'm told it was an employee
[02:28:13.400 --> 02:28:17.240]  of the corporation it was some years ago oh really we now have the ruling by a
[02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:19.960]  court by the employees that sued that it was directed

[02:32:03.640 --> 02:32:07.080]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[02:32:07.080 --> 02:32:10.760]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable
[02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:13.640]  than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even
[02:32:13.640 --> 02:32:16.680]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[02:32:16.680 --> 02:32:19.800]  happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[02:32:19.800 --> 02:32:22.920]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[02:32:22.920 --> 02:32:26.440]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce

[02:33:12.920 --> 02:33:15.480]  okay in the last hour and a half of this
[02:33:15.480 --> 02:33:19.560]  wednesday live broadcast we're gonna open the phones up
[02:33:19.560 --> 02:33:23.960]  on the value-added tax sales taxes and carbon taxes obama is pushing with the
[02:33:23.960 --> 02:33:27.080]  support of the republican party and glenbeck
[02:33:27.080 --> 02:33:31.480]  john hannity bill o'reilly telling you it's so conservative we've got to do this
[02:33:31.480 --> 02:33:36.920]  now we're going to be going back over that information
[02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:41.080]  i'm also going to get into the kergenistan shootings that just
[02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:44.840]  happened literally the west over there trying to cause an implosion
[02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:51.400]  trying to destabilize russia and china also increase in arctic ice confounds
[02:33:51.400 --> 02:33:55.400]  doomsayers but does not spell the end of global warming scientists warned
[02:33:55.400 --> 02:34:00.760]  yeah record level sea ice that's global warming
[02:34:00.760 --> 02:34:05.000]  and we do have that satellite footage essentially right uh uh uh
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:08.600]  and see i found it about a year ago on a nasa sign i haven't found it since
[02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:11.960]  it's a time lapse with a composite from satellites from
[02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:20.120]  76 in fact google 30 year time lapse of arctic ice
[02:34:20.120 --> 02:34:24.360]  30 year oh no no that's a one year that i was able to find this morning
[02:34:24.360 --> 02:34:26.840]  we have up on info wars dot com and principle dot com
[02:34:26.840 --> 02:34:30.120]  we're going to play that one but now that i think about it
[02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:33.560]  let's try one more go or see if watson can find it he couldn't even find it
[02:34:33.560 --> 02:34:39.960]  last time i wanted to it was a 30 year composite
[02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:46.680]  so wait it was 78 to 2008 that's what it was
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:52.520]  uh 30 year satellite composite because why it's important is
[02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:57.640]  it shows what happens it's so elementary and this is of the arctic
[02:34:57.640 --> 02:35:00.440]  there's another one of the anarchy you can find either one will show the same
[02:35:00.440 --> 02:35:03.720]  thing i know it's elementary for all of you out there
[02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:08.280]  it's not elementary for congressman hank johnson of georgia who believes that
[02:35:08.280 --> 02:35:11.320]  islands are floating on the water and too many people get on one side of an island
[02:35:11.320 --> 02:35:15.640]  it will capsize as you said last week uh in congressional testimony
[02:35:15.640 --> 02:35:22.920]  but in the summer the arctic gets smaller and in the fall and winter it gets
[02:35:22.920 --> 02:35:25.720]  bigger it goes
[02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:32.600]  with the seasons big small big small big small big small but they point a
[02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:36.040]  satellite at it and show three months in the summer and show it shrinking
[02:35:36.040 --> 02:35:39.880]  and go oh my god sea levels were all dead past the carbon tax they know full
[02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:42.760]  well that's a fraud they talk to you like your five
[02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:47.000]  year old idiots i don't do that
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:51.480]  they talk to you like your low-grade morons
[02:35:55.480 --> 02:35:58.520]  islands don't float they're not going to capsize man is it causing the
[02:35:58.520 --> 02:36:04.600]  earthquakes and paying al gore some money isn't going to save you
[02:36:04.600 --> 02:36:09.720]  so we're going to be going over uh some of that as well today i just opened the
[02:36:09.720 --> 02:36:14.840]  phones up let me pull up my call list here

[02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:55.560]  go over it i don't even want to have to cover this i'm so sick of the new

[02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:04.200]  i'm so sick of the public like a bunch of stupid children
[02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:09.640]  not wanting to face corruption or evil not realizing that
[02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:17.320]  no one is safe while all of this is going on john did you just get that info
[02:38:17.320 --> 02:38:21.480]  i just sent you
[02:38:21.480 --> 02:38:24.600]  okay good thank you i'm just in here running my own
[02:38:24.600 --> 02:38:28.760]  callboard system um
[02:38:33.400 --> 02:38:36.840]  let's go ahead and talk to pete in south carolina pete you're on the air go
[02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:41.080]  ahead hey alex i was trying to call in i had a
[02:38:41.080 --> 02:38:45.000]  comment about how you're talking about the pedophiles and the cps and all that
[02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:49.560]  um a few years ago i was a victim my three kids were a victim of cps
[02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:54.040]  and what they did their mother had left us um for five years had nothing to do
[02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:57.960]  with the kids uh they got their fingers in on me during a
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:03.000]  nasty divorce but um basically i was the picture perfect parent
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:07.240]  and they uh bad mouth me and tried to throw a lot of slanderous claims against
[02:39:07.240 --> 02:39:11.000]  me that didn't stick they even had attorneys that i had hired that they
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:15.960]  bought off to throw the case and long story short
[02:39:15.960 --> 02:39:18.920]  um i i believe that a lot of your listeners might benefit from what i
[02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:22.520]  had to offer as far as knowledge it'd be really nice if you had a phone that
[02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:26.120]  worked because we want to hear what you have to say pete can you hear me now
[02:39:26.120 --> 02:39:31.720]  yeah you're you were on a the headset well anyways cps hold on just a minute
[02:39:31.720 --> 02:39:34.920]  hold on just a minute because i've asked listeners
[02:39:34.920 --> 02:39:38.200]  that that when people calling on cordlesses or headsets no one can hear
[02:39:38.200 --> 02:39:43.080]  you it it's almost pointless people need to call in from the handheld at least
[02:39:43.080 --> 02:39:45.800]  because now when you hear the rebroadcast you're gonna be able to hear
[02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:49.720]  that what you're having to say is actually being heard now
[02:39:49.720 --> 02:39:55.160]  okay all right well anyways i was saying on the cps thing
[02:39:55.160 --> 02:39:59.480]  my three kids were yanked from me they uh used the excuse that
[02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:04.120]  i worked too much i was working 70 to 90 hours a week
[02:40:04.120 --> 02:40:08.280]  uh... run my own business had a full-time in-home daycare oh yeah no no no
[02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:11.960]  criticizing the government working too much yelling at your kids
[02:40:11.960 --> 02:40:15.640]  there's no law they still come and take them because they're eugenics court
[02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:19.000]  set up a hundred years ago in this country outside of law
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:22.360]  i understand what i wanted to offer up to you and your listeners is
[02:40:22.360 --> 02:40:25.880]  the way they played me was they they said i worked too much that bothered them
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:29.400]  they took the kids they wanted me to do all kinds of counseling and stuff i
[02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:33.880]  done everything they offered and what that's a hidden tax that's a hidden
[02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:37.800]  tax they make you pay to go to their 300 400 an hour
[02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:41.480]  psychologists that they recommend who then lie about you
[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:45.240]  and it's all a big setup yep and what they did was they put them with the
[02:40:45.240 --> 02:40:49.000]  mother who left for five years and wanted nothing to do with them
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:52.120]  and actually had tried to kill the kids previously
[02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:55.720]  and uh... i kind of seen through what they were doing because my own attorney
[02:40:55.720 --> 02:40:58.440]  was bought off and and threw me under the bus
[02:40:58.440 --> 02:41:01.320]  and what they were doing was trying to take the kids from me
[02:41:01.320 --> 02:41:05.400]  and prove me as an unfit parent meanwhile putting them just temporarily with
[02:41:05.400 --> 02:41:09.400]  their poor mother because they knew that in the long run once they proved me
[02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:12.920]  unfit with the ex-mother and everybody helping them
[02:41:12.920 --> 02:41:16.440]  they could easily take them from her and sell them into that's how the setup
[02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:20.040]  works they they out of the gates and a divorce or anything tell the woman to
[02:41:20.040 --> 02:41:23.160]  do this she doesn't understand the father doesn't understand
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:26.440]  and it's all a progression in the setup so how did you beat these criminals
[02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:29.320]  well i had to give up hope on my kids the last
[02:41:29.320 --> 02:41:33.480]  two court dates that we went to i didn't show up for because
[02:41:33.480 --> 02:41:37.880]  every time i went to a court date things got worse they pushed me further away
[02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:39.160]  for my kids
[02:41:39.160 --> 02:41:41.960]  and further away i got less visitation
[02:41:41.960 --> 02:41:45.000]  they were so what happened what ended up happening sir we gotta go well the
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000]  kids are still with their mother
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:50.040]  uh... the one that the mother that tried to poison them and had nothing to do
[02:41:50.040 --> 02:41:51.640]  with them for all their life
[02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:55.240]  um... and i get absolutely no visitation no communication
[02:41:55.240 --> 02:41:58.280]  well pete that really doesn't help us but i appreciate it i mean i uh... you're

[02:42:00.120 --> 02:42:03.480]  i mean i guess it it helps people to know to not communicate with them
[02:42:03.480 --> 02:42:06.760]  but they get involved in your family in the middle
[02:42:06.760 --> 02:42:09.880]  and this is how they do it and then real abuse is ignored
[02:42:09.880 --> 02:42:12.920]  you know the cops can taser a little kid schools can beat them
[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:17.240]  drug them lock them up whatever they want but if parents yell at their kids
[02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:21.400]  they're supposedly evil pete i'm sorry to hear that happened to you

[02:42:39.080 --> 02:42:42.680]  putting in the mileage tax in stock home sweden
[02:42:42.680 --> 02:42:45.920]  and how great it is here in america now we've gotta have it
[02:42:45.920 --> 02:42:48.600]  yeah and how it makes the traffic better and

[02:42:55.680 --> 02:42:58.800]  government announced that they're gonna have mileage taxes i told people this
[02:42:58.800 --> 02:42:59.920]  a decade ago
[02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:04.240]  it doesn't exist even when the mileage tax system is in your car
[02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:08.400]  people will say it doesn't exist because it's a mind trick of slaves
[02:43:08.400 --> 02:43:10.280]  to just deny everything
[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:14.320]  if you you can search i'd be in traffic in stock home

[02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:55.840]  specifically though
[02:46:55.840 --> 02:46:58.480]  people say well this is just war yeah this is
[02:46:58.480 --> 02:46:59.600]  these aggressive
[02:46:59.600 --> 02:47:03.800]  wars that are like video games were not compare the chopper footage to a video
[02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:04.440]  game
[02:47:04.440 --> 02:47:07.000]  the people are being conditioned with coming up the next hour some video and
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:08.040]  audio of that
[02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:09.400]  to educate people
[02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:14.340]  but this is the dehumanization this is what they see as normal now
[02:47:14.340 --> 02:47:18.280]  it totally violates the rules of war and dehumanizes our soldiers
[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:20.760]  and then they say will support the troops you've got to never criticize
[02:47:20.760 --> 02:47:21.620]  what's happening
[02:47:21.620 --> 02:47:23.940]  i'm a citizen i have a right to criticize
[02:47:23.940 --> 02:47:26.320]  these illegal wars based on fraudulent
[02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:27.560]  w md's
[02:47:27.560 --> 02:47:32.360]  i know it's not manly and cool to be in the mass murder and death and darkness
[02:47:32.360 --> 02:47:36.080]  i know the troops are being used up i mean in vietnam maybe two tours world
[02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:37.640]  war two one tour
[02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:40.920]  and most of those guys had mental problems four five six
[02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:42.360]  some doing seven
[02:47:42.360 --> 02:47:43.480]  tours now
[02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:46.200]  this they know they're destroying the troops mentally
[02:47:46.200 --> 02:47:48.160]  that's what they want to do
[02:47:48.160 --> 02:47:50.760]  abusing troops is now patriotism
[02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:54.640]  illegal wars is now patriot no it's not it's a fraud and you got these people
[02:47:54.640 --> 02:47:56.720]  to put themselves up on a high horse
[02:47:56.720 --> 02:48:00.720]  on a mental power trip like they're the moral people and anyone against their
[02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:05.120]  criminal wars is bad they just set the parameters in their own mind no
[02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:09.640]  they are engaged in delusions and evil go ahead
[02:48:09.640 --> 02:48:11.680]  well i think i can think about alex
[02:48:11.680 --> 02:48:16.320]  is that uh... we're gonna see troubles that uh... there is never seen before
[02:48:16.320 --> 02:48:17.640]  in its history
[02:48:17.640 --> 02:48:19.080]  and that uh...
[02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:22.000]  the only reason that it's going to stop is because christ is going to come
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:23.400]  back and stop it
[02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:24.680]  otherwise
[02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:28.320]  we would destroy the whole plan is that you believe it's our job to stand up
[02:48:28.320 --> 02:48:31.080]  against evil though or not just wait for jesus
[02:48:31.080 --> 02:48:33.840]  all absolutely alex and you know what
[02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:37.520]  the only way i can stand up against evil
[02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:39.680]  is to find myself
[02:48:39.680 --> 02:48:41.200]  with the powers of heaven
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:44.280]  the the angels that are watching everything that is going on believe me

[02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:51.400]  the powers of heaven do you then feel an uncontrollable urge to face down

[03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:26.280]  look at how they're trying to take the vets health care away they don't care
[03:03:26.280 --> 03:03:31.880]  about you either supporting the troops means not putting them in illegal wars
[03:03:31.880 --> 03:03:36.280]  you're absolutely right and and these guys these these kids are

[03:09:48.520 --> 03:09:53.160]  yeah that's a great show great interview and uh i just wanted to write some
[03:09:53.160 --> 03:09:56.280]  people here in Bartlett tennessee in Memphis tennessee area
[03:09:56.280 --> 03:10:02.200]  uh the Bartlett police are using their personal vehicles to monitor traffic
[03:10:02.200 --> 03:10:07.160]  to pull people over and write tickets the uh it started off with with just one
[03:10:07.160 --> 03:10:11.240]  sort of a test run and you saw this cop in just a
[03:10:11.240 --> 03:10:15.720]  a crisis c bring no markings with two little lights in the grill and out
[03:10:15.720 --> 03:10:20.200]  steps the uh gentleman in black and writing people tickets and a lot of
[03:10:20.200 --> 03:10:24.280]  departments give them seized cars and let them use it as their own which is a
[03:10:24.280 --> 03:10:28.760]  form of booty right right and that was my next point
[03:10:28.760 --> 03:10:32.840]  was one of these SUVs actually has the little stick figure families that you
[03:10:32.840 --> 03:10:37.240]  see on the back of vehicle sometimes the mom the dad the kids on hands
[03:10:37.240 --> 03:10:40.120]  one of the vehicles actually has that on it and it's just
[03:10:40.120 --> 03:10:44.600]  is out of control now there's the it's just like everything is converting to
[03:10:44.600 --> 03:10:48.920]  secret police yeah yeah and often we're thinking
[03:10:48.920 --> 03:10:54.440]  the uh how do you combat cps i had an experience with cps where
[03:10:54.440 --> 03:10:58.680]  it's true i state they will frame you they will say things that aren't true
[03:10:58.680 --> 03:11:01.240]  if you question their their authority
[03:11:01.240 --> 03:11:06.200]  um i recently honestly was set up i've got the letter to prove it
[03:11:06.200 --> 03:11:09.880]  and or whether trying to lay a path that i'm a poor parent
[03:11:09.880 --> 03:11:14.040]  um where do i go well there are a lot of different homeschooler
[03:11:14.040 --> 03:11:17.800]  associations and and associations that have lawyers that we've had on many
[03:11:17.800 --> 03:11:20.920]  times that document the tactics the biggest thing is don't have them in
[03:11:20.920 --> 03:11:24.680]  public school that's where they hunt your kids that's where they make stuff up
[03:11:24.680 --> 03:11:27.320]  but they bankrupted most people who they have to be in public school you
[03:11:27.320 --> 03:11:31.320]  teach your kids not to talk to the authorities not to trust them to keep
[03:11:31.320 --> 03:11:34.840]  their mouths shut then that they're there to take them away from mommy and
[03:11:34.840 --> 03:11:38.360]  daddy and how bad these people are that's what our forefathers did we've
[03:11:38.360 --> 03:11:41.800]  lost that common sense and uh you don't answer the door the
[03:11:41.800 --> 03:11:46.200]  first time they show up uh and uh you stick a video camera in their
[03:11:46.200 --> 03:11:48.200]  face you explain you have the full constitution and
[03:11:48.200 --> 03:11:51.880]  bill of rights uh behind you and i would just stay away from them
[03:11:51.880 --> 03:11:56.760]  and uh you know your kids are worth it uh before you ever even talk to them
[03:11:56.760 --> 03:12:00.120]  it's just best to drop everything and move five counties over
[03:12:00.120 --> 03:12:04.440]  if you have to i mean better safe than sorry because they don't operate under
[03:12:04.440 --> 03:12:08.040]  the law uh dinecore runs most the state cps units they
[03:12:08.040 --> 03:12:12.120]  run child kidnapping rings worldwide i'd say probably half the cps workers are
[03:12:12.120 --> 03:12:15.160]  pedophiles and then that's come out over and over again this
[03:12:15.160 --> 03:12:17.960]  so it couldn't be a more criminal group it's pedophiles
[03:12:17.960 --> 03:12:21.720]  with false authority coming after your family
[03:12:21.720 --> 03:12:27.480]  yeah another quick bit of info real quick um i heard heard the uh the the lady
[03:12:27.480 --> 03:12:31.080]  the the i don't know a senator congresswoman that was shot her husband

[03:24:20.120 --> 03:24:24.760]  those they're killing and maiming but
[03:24:24.760 --> 03:24:30.360]  i don't want to recap all of this but for those that just joined us
[03:24:30.360 --> 03:24:34.520]  over a year ago richard ploskey a white supremacist who all over the web hated
[03:24:34.520 --> 03:24:37.320]  me and had all these blogs about how bad i was
[03:24:37.320 --> 03:24:41.160]  because i'm not any semitic and don't call for violence shot three cops and
[03:24:41.160 --> 03:24:43.880]  killed them the southern poverty law center with their
[03:24:43.880 --> 03:24:46.840]  reporter within two hours said that it was basically my fault
[03:24:46.840 --> 03:24:50.440]  we forced retractions in five newspapers because we went and found that he was
[03:24:50.440 --> 03:24:52.840]  attacking me everywhere and was not supporting me
[03:24:52.840 --> 03:24:55.880]  we've had to go to registration on the comments at infowars.com and
[03:24:55.880 --> 03:24:59.720]  prismplana.com uh and it has up the quality of some of the
[03:24:59.720 --> 03:25:04.440]  comments uh because people were going in there calling
[03:25:04.440 --> 03:25:08.040]  for violence and i have three moderators we didn't censor anybody
[03:25:08.040 --> 03:25:14.760]  unless they called for violence and or spammed
[03:25:14.760 --> 03:25:18.040]  and we've seen the london guardian the new york times time magazine
[03:25:18.040 --> 03:25:21.160]  literally hundreds of publications media matters
[03:25:21.160 --> 03:25:23.960]  it's got to be more than 50 times i haven't counted it up run by george
[03:25:23.960 --> 03:25:28.840]  soros went to the banker went to loot america running obama
[03:25:28.840 --> 03:25:32.600]  saying that i'm calling for violence and and it's not true
[03:25:32.600 --> 03:25:36.680]  and everyone knows that so they're clearly trying to set me up with the
[03:25:36.680 --> 03:25:43.480]  police and the irs but it says alex jones pits fox news versus fox news
[03:25:43.480 --> 03:25:47.400]  last week fox news wrote two articles off comments on infowars.com
[03:25:47.400 --> 03:25:51.960]  and prismplana.com that was the last straw we went to registration
[03:25:51.960 --> 03:25:55.080]  and
[03:25:55.080 --> 03:26:00.280]  they spend this even more than fox news and say that it's my fault
[03:26:00.280 --> 03:26:03.880]  and that oh look fox news is in trouble they've got involved with me
[03:26:03.880 --> 03:26:06.680]  we wrote an article showing fox nation with people
[03:26:06.680 --> 03:26:10.680]  calling for things way more violent in actual articles that they wrote
[03:26:10.680 --> 03:26:14.920]  and on fox news with the videos
[03:26:14.920 --> 03:26:18.440]  fox news is pushing for the value added tax at obama once they all work together
[03:26:18.440 --> 03:26:22.440]  it makes me sick but look at this article this is just today's latest it's
[03:26:22.440 --> 03:26:25.880]  every day alex jones pits fox news versus fox news
[03:26:25.880 --> 03:26:28.680]  our summit fox news having second thoughts about embracing and helping to
[03:26:28.680 --> 03:26:32.600]  mainstream fringe anti-government conspiracy not alex jones
[03:26:32.600 --> 03:26:36.040]  did no one's done that i mean they had me on about 9 11
[03:26:36.040 --> 03:26:42.040]  to try to blame the shooting on me at the pentagon
[03:26:42.040 --> 03:26:46.680]  that that wasn't them being friendly to me especially now that jones website
[03:26:46.680 --> 03:26:50.120]  seems to be stoking calls for violence against federal employees
[03:26:50.120 --> 03:26:54.680]  i'm stoking calls when you go to any big website and read
[03:26:54.680 --> 03:26:58.200]  violent comments that doesn't mean msnbc or cnn or
[03:26:58.200 --> 03:27:02.840]  any other outfits guilty of it here's a recent fox news dot com report on the
[03:27:02.840 --> 03:27:05.560]  rash of anti-government threats being made on irs workers
[03:27:05.560 --> 03:27:08.840]  in the wake of health care reform being passed
[03:27:08.840 --> 03:27:12.840]  and then it goes through it so it appears that jones at the center of the
[03:27:12.840 --> 03:27:16.360]  radical anti-government movement and owns a radical right wing website
[03:27:16.360 --> 03:27:19.640]  we're constitutional it's not right wing which seems to be housing lots of
[03:27:19.640 --> 03:27:24.200]  potentially murderous rhetoric about the irs we're housing
[03:27:24.200 --> 03:27:28.120]  so we need to be restricted like ed schultz says message from fox news dot com
[03:27:28.120 --> 03:27:32.120]  article alex jones is a bad guy that's odd because last year fox news presented
[03:27:32.120 --> 03:27:35.960]  the same government hating jones as something of a folk hero
[03:27:35.960 --> 03:27:40.760]  what so this is what they're doing and they're
[03:27:40.760 --> 03:27:45.080]  calling for censorship of everybody but they're singling me out why is george
[03:27:45.080 --> 03:27:48.440]  soros doing that because i'm against further banker bailouts i'm against the
[03:27:48.440 --> 03:27:51.640]  insurance takeover that's a new tax written up by the insurance companies
[03:27:51.640 --> 03:27:56.280]  94 percent of their lobbying went for it that's wall street journal
[03:27:56.280 --> 03:27:59.000]  i'm here telling the truth i'm here shattering the left right paradigm
[03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:02.120]  i'm here explaining that republican leaders and their pundits are pushing
[03:28:02.120 --> 03:28:06.920]  for the value added tax to be paid to the bankers when we don't know this money
[03:28:06.920 --> 03:28:11.320]  we're real ladies and gentlemen and uh you know it is spooky it is creepy that
[03:28:11.320 --> 03:28:15.000]  this is going on now before i get into all the value added
[03:28:15.000 --> 03:28:19.880]  taxes and the rest of it uh that are now coming
[03:28:19.880 --> 03:28:23.400]  i want to get into this rat on your boss get paid by the irs this has been going
[03:28:23.400 --> 03:28:27.800]  on for years but this says you can get 15 to 30 percent
[03:28:27.800 --> 03:28:31.320]  of anything you rat on your boss about and with basically
[03:28:31.320 --> 03:28:35.480]  informants the government just has people lie about you to get the money
[03:28:35.480 --> 03:28:39.160]  so this is the total snitch culture now here's another one
[03:28:39.160 --> 03:28:43.800]  remember us a day a few years ago about how when you call to get a pizza
[03:28:43.800 --> 03:28:46.760]  they run your name through the database to see if there's any warrants and they
[03:28:46.760 --> 03:28:50.920]  also sell the data to uh bill collectors
[03:28:50.920 --> 03:28:55.560]  of where you really live so it's just every major corporation is doing this
[03:28:55.560 --> 03:28:59.800]  dallas this is out of msnbc dallas based nark tech technologies
[03:28:59.800 --> 03:29:03.480]  ink pays people to rat on their neighbors and what for
[03:29:03.480 --> 03:29:07.400]  just to know where all their neighbors are in case there's bill collectors
[03:29:07.400 --> 03:29:10.680]  so your neighbors this is the new economy there's only jobs in government and
[03:29:10.680 --> 03:29:14.120]  narking they're converting the whole economy over to this
[03:29:14.120 --> 03:29:16.760]  can you make money just by writing down the license plate numbers of cars in

[03:29:28.920 --> 03:29:31.880]  but how does it work one of the two dallas based
[03:29:31.880 --> 03:29:35.320]  companies nark technology zinc offers a simple explanation

[03:33:35.000 --> 03:33:39.400]  watching computer screens tattling on people surveillance cameras

[03:33:42.760 --> 03:33:45.880]  getting into the business of repossession it says its plans use the

[03:33:58.760 --> 03:34:02.040]  information hungry marketing firms and to turn its
[03:34:02.040 --> 03:34:08.040]  user base into a kind of buyers club and they're given citizens radar guns and
[03:34:08.040 --> 03:34:11.800]  teaching kids how to spy all the popular kid toys are about spying on your
[03:34:11.800 --> 03:34:16.120]  parents here's another headline will jotting down license
[03:34:16.120 --> 03:34:21.560]  plates pay the rent that's another article
[03:34:23.400 --> 03:34:27.880]  see we are being baptized in evil we're being trained to do everything
[03:34:27.880 --> 03:34:31.080]  that brings you tyranny
[03:34:32.440 --> 03:34:35.560]  separately i want to get into the economy now before we play this video
[03:34:35.560 --> 03:34:38.760]  clip and take some more calls
[03:34:39.080 --> 03:34:43.000]  here's the message you're not going to get from the wall street journal that is
[03:34:43.000 --> 03:34:49.720]  reporting valker carbon tax vat value added should be on the table
[03:34:49.720 --> 03:34:53.400]  the republican pundits for more than a decade
[03:34:53.400 --> 03:34:57.000]  have been telling you they're going to replace the income tax with a vat and
[03:34:57.000 --> 03:35:00.040]  sales tax no i've been telling you because we have the
[03:35:00.040 --> 03:35:03.480]  documents from the pr firms that they're going to keep all of them now they
[03:35:03.480 --> 03:35:06.440]  admit that this is the way to pay off the deficit
[03:35:06.440 --> 03:35:08.840]  how about we cut the government how about we don't owe this money like
[03:35:08.840 --> 03:35:13.960]  iceland and greaser saying no to paying how about we cut all of these programs
[03:35:13.960 --> 03:35:18.520]  know the government's growing and grow and hiring more and more people
[03:35:18.520 --> 03:35:22.840]  every millisecond and hiring snitches and spies and tattletales
[03:35:22.840 --> 03:35:26.600]  and squeezing and writing more tickets and grabbing more children
[03:35:26.600 --> 03:35:33.000]  it is a criminal enterprise that is taken over the nation and we have an
[03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:35.960]  article here by curtain demo that breaks it all down
[03:35:35.960 --> 03:35:39.720]  former fed mob boss calls vat and carbon taxes
[03:35:39.720 --> 03:35:43.720]  calls for vat and carbon taxes
[03:35:44.040 --> 03:35:49.080]  and the big problem here is well cue it up queue up blend back on
[03:35:49.080 --> 03:35:54.920]  below riley and this is almost every day on his radio or tv show both of them
[03:35:54.920 --> 03:35:58.360]  calling for this calling for this and saying don't worry we're gonna have a
[03:35:58.360 --> 03:36:01.560]  constitutional amendment where 100 percent of the money
[03:36:01.560 --> 03:36:06.440]  goes to pay the banks play the clip last night i know you watch factor every
[03:36:06.440 --> 03:36:09.240]  night yes so you can steal material oh my god
[03:36:09.240 --> 03:36:14.600]  and i said that economically we can bring the country back but you have to do
[03:36:14.600 --> 03:36:17.960]  some discipline you have to free spending yep you have to have a
[03:36:17.960 --> 03:36:21.400]  national sales tax yep percent what did you think about that
[03:36:21.400 --> 03:36:25.880]  um i actually i made some notes excellent i actually agree with you
[03:36:25.880 --> 03:36:30.600]  except i believe it should be a vat tax two percent vat value added no more
[03:36:30.600 --> 03:36:33.560]  no more than two percent what's the difference between a sales tax and a
[03:36:33.560 --> 03:36:37.240]  value add only starts with two percent that's enough
[03:36:37.240 --> 03:36:40.360]  that's enough now with conservatives like these who
[03:36:40.360 --> 03:36:44.760]  needs mousetown who needs joe stalin
[03:36:44.760 --> 03:36:48.040]  obama spent more money than all presidents before him combined we thought
[03:36:48.040 --> 03:36:53.240]  bush was bad tripling the size of the government tripling the budget
[03:36:54.280 --> 03:36:57.240]  and they've got all these conservatives running around talking about fair taxes
[03:36:57.240 --> 03:37:02.120]  all day look get ready the bankers now have dominated and
[03:37:02.120 --> 03:37:05.640]  overthrown this country economically it's all done through fraud
[03:37:05.640 --> 03:37:09.960]  and the the the health care bills a bunch of taxes all these other income taxes
[03:37:09.960 --> 03:37:14.040]  all these state income taxes all these unfunded mandates to the states
[03:37:14.040 --> 03:37:17.640]  the carbon taxes that obama is trying to ram through the senate again
[03:37:17.640 --> 03:37:20.200]  and they're announcing next week they're going to go ahead and implement it
[03:37:20.200 --> 03:37:25.400]  through the epa regardless this is all illegal and lawless
[03:37:25.400 --> 03:37:29.960]  and people need to get angry and realize that the republican party was in power
[03:37:29.960 --> 03:37:33.080]  of both the house the senate and the executives
[03:37:33.080 --> 03:37:38.760]  for six years of bushes eight years and the government tripled
[03:37:38.760 --> 03:37:42.040]  and that's why people are voting for rand paul in kentucky and why the
[03:37:42.040 --> 03:37:45.240]  republican party's coming in trying to stop it because he's 10 points ahead
[03:37:45.240 --> 03:37:49.400]  because this is an anti-incumbency against republicans and democrats who
[03:37:49.400 --> 03:37:54.120]  are globalist who are incumbents that's why for the first time in history
[03:37:54.120 --> 03:37:58.440]  in the u.s the head election official who's running against rand paul
[03:37:58.440 --> 03:38:02.920]  is allowed to run his own campaign against rand paul and run the election
[03:38:02.920 --> 03:38:07.240]  i mean you talk about mafia because if they let anybody like a deborah medina
[03:38:07.240 --> 03:38:10.280]  or a rand paul get in that sends shock waves
[03:38:10.280 --> 03:38:13.160]  through the country we got to take the states back
[03:38:13.160 --> 03:38:16.440]  take the federal government back from the un and the offshore banks that have
[03:38:16.440 --> 03:38:20.040]  bought it off it's very elementary these banks have taken over hundreds of
[03:38:20.040 --> 03:38:22.360]  third world nations they do the same thing every time
[03:38:22.360 --> 03:38:27.800]  they get you in debt then they jack up the taxes cut all the so-called
[03:38:27.800 --> 03:38:33.240]  all the so-called entitlements and and and freebies
[03:38:33.240 --> 03:38:36.040]  okay i've got some other news i want to hit on but i briefly because i've got to
[03:38:36.040 --> 03:38:38.440]  get to this video here in a moment i wanted to bring ten anderson up of
[03:38:38.440 --> 03:38:42.360]  minus resources because gold for the last week has been shooting straight up
[03:38:42.360 --> 03:38:47.080]  it's come out in lawsuits uh that the imf world bank and federal reserve have
[03:38:47.080 --> 03:38:51.240]  been suppressing gold and silver prices with inflation gold should be 2500
[03:38:51.240 --> 03:38:54.680]  silver should be above 30 that's conservative right now
[03:38:54.680 --> 03:38:59.960]  regardless ten anderson's got gold and silver the owner of this radio network
[03:38:59.960 --> 03:39:03.880]  that's how i met him he was a sponsor of my show 13 years ago before he started
[03:39:03.880 --> 03:39:07.640]  this network he already produced his own radio shows his own news shows
[03:39:07.640 --> 03:39:11.640]  and i found nowhere to buy gold at a better price or silver at a better price
[03:39:11.640 --> 03:39:15.640]  he's been in business 30 years had minus for what 13 years
[03:39:15.640 --> 03:39:19.240]  and he's got a triple a rating with a better business bureau most these places
[03:39:19.240 --> 03:39:22.920]  don't most of them have horrible ratings you need to buy gold and silver from
[03:39:22.920 --> 03:39:25.800]  ted you need to protect yourself with physical
[03:39:25.800 --> 03:39:30.360]  holdings and i get it as an insurance policy against inflation and depression
[03:39:30.360 --> 03:39:34.200]  and crises i don't buy gold and silver as an investment but as an emergency
[03:39:34.200 --> 03:39:37.720]  backup but it is an investment that's almost 400 percent
[03:39:37.720 --> 03:39:40.680]  in the last decade versus the stock market that's basically flat with
[03:39:40.680 --> 03:39:43.560]  inflation ten anderson good to have you here with us
[03:39:43.560 --> 03:39:46.920]  tell folks about today's incredible offer when i say incredible folks
[03:39:46.920 --> 03:39:51.800]  ted explain yeah sure i'll tell you right now gold's up another 20 dollars today
[03:39:51.800 --> 03:39:55.880]  actually that's where it's marked peak was currently right now up 16 bucks in the
[03:39:55.880 --> 03:40:01.160]  1150 range i still have those franks at 249 68
[03:40:01.160 --> 03:40:04.280]  and yes you still get the international forecaster
[03:40:04.280 --> 03:40:08.360]  calculated out it's it's less than 500 dollars an ounce
[03:40:08.360 --> 03:40:12.840]  for that piece of gold i mean it's really low the whole market i mean that the
[03:40:12.840 --> 03:40:17.160]  british sovereigns 312 42 look at the internet prices there they've
[03:40:17.160 --> 03:40:21.960]  gone up now the the i'm still holding the same on the
[03:40:21.960 --> 03:40:25.800]  on the sovereign coins from the montana let's explain to people
[03:40:25.800 --> 03:40:30.680]  okay you bought when gold went down but you didn't make your prices go up when
[03:40:30.680 --> 03:40:33.560]  it went up you're still have gold and silver that you're
[03:40:33.560 --> 03:40:37.560]  selling when the market was a hundred dollars
[03:40:37.560 --> 03:40:42.440]  plus lower that was one thousand fifty it's it's it's one thousand one hundred and
[03:40:42.440 --> 03:40:44.920]  fifty so right at a hundred dollars right now
[03:40:44.920 --> 03:40:48.360]  and so any tiny markup you had on that lower price
[03:40:48.360 --> 03:40:52.200]  isn't even there anymore because you're we're in a market that's a hundred
[03:40:52.200 --> 03:40:55.960]  dollars up and on the fifth of an ounce european gold
[03:40:55.960 --> 03:40:59.400]  frank coin you're giving them a hundred and fifty nine dollar value your

[03:41:28.920 --> 03:41:32.600]  today it is by design they want this thing to fail so we can
[03:41:32.600 --> 03:41:36.680]  be pushed into this international currency thing and obviously that's not
[03:41:36.680 --> 03:41:39.880]  good for our sovereignty here in the united states at all

[03:42:58.440 --> 03:43:01.560]  busy highway randomly shooting up cars full of people laughing
[03:43:01.560 --> 03:43:04.280]  the government and the media defend this
[03:43:04.280 --> 03:43:07.560]  you destroy and disgrace our military when you do that if you care about the
[03:43:07.560 --> 03:43:10.120]  military in our history which has been a great history
[03:43:10.120 --> 03:43:14.360]  you don't allow the nazi vacation of our military you decry what's happening
[03:43:14.360 --> 03:43:19.000]  but scientifically using government developed video games the last 35 years
[03:43:19.000 --> 03:43:22.040]  that's on record they have conditioned people to have
[03:43:22.040 --> 03:43:25.480]  instinctive killing and to enjoy it and to see it as a game
[03:43:25.480 --> 03:43:29.240]  this is turning our people into psychopath psychopaths enjoy killing
[03:43:29.240 --> 03:43:32.920]  if you got to go to war and got to kill that's one thing you don't enjoy it

[03:43:51.800 --> 03:43:54.520]  showing the conditioning in this video game that made six hundred million
[03:43:54.520 --> 03:43:57.800]  dollars in the last few months this is what people are playing and now the
[03:43:57.800 --> 03:44:01.560]  pentagon admits a couple months ago i saw an msnbc
[03:44:01.560 --> 03:44:05.560]  that they're using playstation controllers to fly predator drones
[03:44:05.560 --> 03:44:08.920]  and they're taking young college students that have high scores
[03:44:08.920 --> 03:44:12.760]  and now they're piloting drones and it's all a big joke they've been conditioned
[03:44:12.760 --> 03:44:16.280]  on video games and this is all part of us losing our soul
[03:44:16.280 --> 03:44:19.960]  and and now killing innocent civilians and now they're deploying drones
