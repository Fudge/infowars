[00:00.000 --> 00:06.960]  communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[00:16.000 --> 00:19.680]  all right folks i know we've got Eleanor and others that have been holding patiently your
[00:19.680 --> 00:25.360]  calls are coming up we're going to have a caller for best-selling author he's got a powerful
[00:25.360 --> 00:31.840]  website he's a top BBC investigative reporter he's talked about Lord Wakem head of N.M. Rothschild
[00:31.840 --> 00:37.600]  trying to censor him he broke the story one of the biggest stories of the last year in fact one
[00:37.600 --> 00:42.800]  of the biggest stories ever and i'm serious when i say that about a thousand pages getting leaked
[00:42.800 --> 00:49.680]  out of the world bank and of course the defection of sticklets the chief economist the world bank
[00:49.680 --> 00:54.720]  their plan to implode economies their four-part plan we're going to recap that today and get the
[00:54.720 --> 00:59.600]  latest developments from this investigative journalist who i would call a populist because
[01:00.720 --> 01:05.600]  you know greg palace is a hero of the left but this guy went after bill clinton
[01:05.600 --> 01:10.960]  he exposes this corporate elite that is big government that is socialistic in their
[01:10.960 --> 01:16.240]  consolidation of the public trust then consolidating that into their private hands
[01:16.240 --> 01:20.480]  we're dealing with a command and control system ladies and gentlemen and he does
[01:20.480 --> 01:25.520]  real investigative journalism like they did in this country a hundred years ago we're honored
[01:25.520 --> 01:30.240]  to have him i wanted to before we go to greg pal say one more thing about the game dungeon keeper
[01:30.240 --> 01:35.760]  and these other games like grand theft auto 3 where you go and you blow a prostitute's head
[01:35.760 --> 01:40.240]  off and you get bonus points and the games where you kidnap children and torture them to death
[01:41.840 --> 01:46.960]  folks we must censor things like this okay because the government's already moving to censor websites
[01:46.960 --> 01:52.160]  like mine that don't have anything you know profane or distasteful on it other than what
[01:52.160 --> 01:57.200]  the globalists are doing and we'll have a debate about that in the third hour of the show today but
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.320]  you just had somebody who designs video games calling oh yeah it's true dungeon keeper you
[02:02.320 --> 02:06.720]  really do kidnap children and torture them to death folks this is the object of the game what's
[02:06.720 --> 02:12.960]  happened to our society we are this country is a bunch of degenerate satanic Romans we're entering
[02:12.960 --> 02:16.800]  this decadent cycle and i'm trying to get people to wake up because you don't want to live in a
[02:17.760 --> 02:23.040]  that allows this type of stuff this is pure tyranny ladies and gentlemen uh greg i know
[02:23.040 --> 02:27.280]  that's a bizarre caveat to throw in if you're sitting there on hold but we had a big discussion
[02:27.280 --> 02:31.600]  of it in the last hour because people are being blown away by these video games but um
[02:32.240 --> 02:37.520]  what's the latest info that you're working on sir good to have you on okay great to be on alex and
[02:37.520 --> 02:41.680]  by the way i have to say that uh i guess i'm not the darling of the left anymore they're very upset
[02:41.680 --> 02:49.040]  with me the problem is that my target is not the left or the right my target is a very small
[02:49.040 --> 02:56.240]  privileged elite which thinks that the globe is their toy and i think that you know uh journalists
[02:56.240 --> 03:01.120]  the the old line like you say the old types of journalists muckrakers used to think that it was
[03:01.120 --> 03:06.800]  their job to uncover that stuff and it's kind of going out of style so but i'm glad that uh you've
[03:06.800 --> 03:12.080]  you've opened up a chink in the electronic berlin wall here and to get this information
[03:12.080 --> 03:19.120]  out so i really do appreciate it i've been working on a lot of things um one i just came back uh from
[03:19.120 --> 03:26.400]  caracas venezuela uh and uh they've been uh the u.s government and the banks and the oil companies
[03:26.400 --> 03:30.720]  have been working out on the president of venezuela they they say the communist the dictator
[03:30.720 --> 03:36.640]  and etcetera but they don't tell you is the reason they're out after this guy is that he is
[03:36.640 --> 03:43.680]  not just the president of venezuela he's the president of opec and um he has doubled the
[03:43.680 --> 03:48.880]  royalties on oil companies the taking oil out of venezuela not many people know that venezuela is
[03:48.880 --> 03:54.160]  our main supplier of oil in this hemisphere seven days before the attempted coup on the
[03:54.160 --> 03:58.960]  legitimately elected president of venezuela you said look for a coup in the next month
[03:59.040 --> 04:03.440]  that's right and that transcript and that audio file are on the select interview section
[04:03.440 --> 04:08.880]  of info wars.com greg how did you uh call that one with such precision well actually it wasn't
[04:08.880 --> 04:14.160]  a big guess i just now i can tell you is that i got a call from uh i spoke to the head of the
[04:14.160 --> 04:22.800]  secretary general of opec in vietnam and he had received uh um qaddafi contacted him to threaten
[04:22.800 --> 04:28.080]  a boycott against the united states qaddafi's no great wonderful guy um and the head of opec
[04:28.080 --> 04:32.560]  reminded him that opec has now banned the political boycott nevertheless the word got
[04:32.560 --> 04:37.280]  out to the u.s and the head of opec realized well the first thing the u.s is going to do to counter
[04:37.280 --> 04:42.640]  any threat of a boycott or let's say if we do invade iraq those oil fields will be on fire
[04:42.640 --> 04:48.640]  where do you suddenly find an extra million or two million barrels of oil our our supposed
[04:48.640 --> 04:54.080]  friends the saudi arabians won't give us an extra drop if all our factories start shutting down
[04:54.080 --> 04:58.880]  they'll be thrilled to see us go under the saudis where do we get the oil and the answer would be
[04:58.880 --> 05:04.800]  from venezuela which can produce an extra two million uh barrels of oil at the flick of a switch
[05:05.680 --> 05:12.400]  and but there is a fear in the bush administration that the president of venezuela uh will not
[05:13.120 --> 05:17.920]  go along and give this oil to exxon which controls most of the oil in venezuela let's
[05:17.920 --> 05:22.720]  let's expand on this point of him supposedly being a communist now he's not a communist
[05:22.720 --> 05:28.320]  oh no he's a big you know he's a very religious uh catholic you know he's from the old style
[05:28.320 --> 05:34.000]  of uh kind of progressive land reform guy he believes in land reform and redistribution of
[05:34.000 --> 05:39.360]  of wealth uh in venezuela where you have a teeny weeny elite it's not you can't can't compare to
[05:39.360 --> 05:44.480]  the united states you got this tiny elite with giant plantations and big giant apartments let
[05:44.480 --> 05:50.560]  me expand on that you know pointless of what his political persuasion is i'm tired of this corporate
[05:50.560 --> 05:57.040]  elite this car law group you know cia panaxis telling me that they're going to fight communists
[05:57.040 --> 06:01.840]  when they're telling us that china is our ally when they're selling political this and its organs
[06:01.840 --> 06:08.000]  giving nuclear reactors in north korea i watch the history channel they now admit the cia actually
[06:08.000 --> 06:14.160]  put mao into power they put fidel into power they put they helped prop the hochi men up until 1963
[06:14.160 --> 06:18.400]  it's the same story over and over again they call somebody a communist when they want the natural
[06:18.400 --> 06:23.360]  resources or now i guess it's not communist they call them they call them terrors yeah and and yes
[06:23.360 --> 06:28.080]  he's communist doesn't work too well anymore especially when when we are selling um equipment
[06:28.080 --> 06:33.760]  to the chinese who are pulling out the fingernails of uh of christian priests um so and they're
[06:33.760 --> 06:41.120]  now said two weeks ago greg palace said uh oh you can go ahead and have taiwan uh china yeah well
[06:41.120 --> 06:46.880]  you know it's uh so yeah so after all the biggest nation supporting the communist chinese is the
[06:46.880 --> 06:52.800]  current administration in the white house but uh in and so now it's terrorism but the president of
[06:52.800 --> 06:56.640]  venezuela and and by the way whether we like him or not whether he's a wonderful guy or not
[06:56.640 --> 07:02.000]  he is elected and when some of the white uh asked that uh journalists did ask some at the white
[07:02.000 --> 07:08.160]  house surprisingly how can you move to overthrow an elected official elected president and the
[07:08.160 --> 07:13.360]  white house response as well winning a majority of the vote does not make your government legitimate
[07:14.000 --> 07:18.320]  that's a pretty interesting statement out of the white house yeah we saw that before
[07:18.320 --> 07:23.280]  and um and in fact by the way that that's another thing i want to bring up at some point is what's
[07:23.280 --> 07:28.720]  happening tuesday with the monkeying with votes again i'm just uh deeply disturbed about the
[07:28.720 --> 07:34.800]  information i'm uncovering out of florida once again and uh but but no question out of venezuela
[07:34.800 --> 07:41.920]  we're seeing this turkey um is uh you know now we have uh an islamic government that's taking over
[07:41.920 --> 07:46.320]  in turkey that's gonna that's gonna be really lovely and how did that happen that happened
[07:46.320 --> 07:54.000]  because the imf and world bank squeezed that nation until it screamed my books by the way
[07:54.000 --> 07:58.800]  are very popular in turkey because i try to explain what's going on with the world bank
[07:58.800 --> 08:05.200]  and the imf let's explain it can we revert back to that interview about a year ago sure concerning
[08:05.200 --> 08:11.200]  the four-part world bank imf plan and sticklets and break down those four points i mean this is
[08:11.200 --> 08:14.800]  a big deal i mean people are saying why are the economies imploding and the government's saying
[08:14.800 --> 08:18.400]  give us control of your lives we're here to save you on their own documents show they're
[08:18.400 --> 08:23.520]  engineering it please go over that sir okay well what happened is that about a year ago um i
[08:23.520 --> 08:29.120]  received oh a good thousand pages of documents from inside the world bank and the imf the
[08:29.120 --> 08:34.640]  international monetary fund based out of washington these are the two organizations uh which work in
[08:34.640 --> 08:42.240]  coordination uh with the wto world trade organization and they are in control of the world
[08:42.240 --> 08:48.000]  movement of capital they are the the in effect the central banks and the uh kind of treasury
[08:48.000 --> 08:53.520]  departments for the for the planet and of course they work very closely with banks out of new york
[08:53.520 --> 08:57.680]  and i say of course um yeah i had to get this information from inside so i'm looking at these
[08:57.680 --> 09:02.560]  documents well it's the same private owners of the stocks of these uh banks dutch royal family
[09:02.560 --> 09:08.000]  british royal family and others well what you have is is that you have uh in the documents i have
[09:08.720 --> 09:12.560]  and i have some of them you know photocopy my book i'm going to try to get more on the web
[09:12.560 --> 09:18.080]  etcetera it's just it's just been i've just been going on great palace dot com i'll be putting up
[09:18.080 --> 09:24.320]  more and by the way the u.s version of my book uh much expanded will be coming out in february
[09:24.320 --> 09:29.600]  but in the meantime for bbc television and the guardian newspapers which is considered the most
[09:29.600 --> 09:35.440]  prestigious of papers on the planet um i i received these documents and they'd say you know
[09:35.440 --> 09:42.400]  official use only don't look at this you know world bank uh you have to be authorized and each
[09:42.400 --> 09:49.360]  coverage has argentina bolivia venezuela potwana and it has all these nations and it has for each
[09:49.360 --> 09:54.880]  nation an economic program and you look at the economic program and some of them have very most
[09:54.880 --> 09:59.120]  and have these very nice names like poverty reduction strategy you think boy boy they're
[09:59.120 --> 10:03.200]  really going to help out these nations so why is this why is it secret if they're going to be so
[10:03.200 --> 10:08.080]  helpful have you ever heard of you know anyone kind of secretly helping someone so it's uh why
[10:08.080 --> 10:13.600]  the secrecy and you open the stuff up and these are programs which point by point i mean they go
[10:13.600 --> 10:20.000]  on to sometimes 100 pages uh and they have specific demands on each country which if they don't agree
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.520]  to it they call them conditionalities and they average 114 conditionalities per nation
[10:26.080 --> 10:30.000]  you get your international finance is cut off unless you agree to the whole package
[10:30.640 --> 10:37.040]  and and one nation after another it required the sell-off of water systems of electric systems to
[10:37.040 --> 10:44.560]  foreign operators it required the the sale of the of the banks to foreign operators allowing changing
[10:44.560 --> 10:50.560]  rules to allow banks to remove the capital from nations and one of the most tragic cases i saw
[10:50.560 --> 10:57.520]  was argentina where the economy is was uh where they call it the imf riot they know it's gonna
[10:57.520 --> 11:02.480]  create right oh yeah well one of the things i should mention is that they in the plans they
[11:02.480 --> 11:08.480]  say we know for example in the case of ecuador it actually says that this will cause social unrest
[11:08.480 --> 11:15.120]  if you implement this plan which and and so i now the former chief economist of the world bank is
[11:15.120 --> 11:20.800]  named joe siglin and the guy is he's not some type of wacko the man just won the nobel prize in
[11:20.800 --> 11:27.840]  economics okay now i spoke to him for hours at cambridge university and at london school of
[11:27.840 --> 11:33.040]  economics where we both lectured and i'm an economist as well by the way and he basically
[11:33.040 --> 11:38.000]  said they have a plan which they know they called them internally imf riots they deliberately knew
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.480]  that these plans would set off riots and cause these capitals these nations to burn down and
[11:42.480 --> 11:47.200]  then that causes the economy to further implode and they have a consolidation and then they and
[11:47.200 --> 11:51.840]  then everything's up for sale cheap greg palace will be back in just a few minutes stay right
[11:51.840 --> 11:57.920]  there a lot more coming up and then your calls folks 800-259-9231 stay with us
[11:57.920 --> 12:10.400]  all right folks welcome back we're talking to greg palace investigative journalist the bbc broken
[12:10.400 --> 12:15.360]  a lot of bombshell stories over the years he's also a best-selling author of multiple books the
[12:15.360 --> 12:20.000]  website's greg palace.com greg have you seen the new council on foreign relations report they put
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.120]  out about a week and a half ago america still unprepared america still endangered by gary hart
[12:25.120 --> 12:32.960]  and rudman regarding saudi arabia well i just saw another one of the reports but go ahead we
[12:32.960 --> 12:37.760]  may be talking about different ones well it just says that you have total control to a select group
[12:37.760 --> 12:44.400]  of corporations under cfr control nationalize basically everything but have control in the
[12:44.400 --> 12:49.040]  private corporations put troops in all the factories and on the streets or they say on
[12:49.040 --> 12:55.360]  page 31 80 to 80 plus percent will die in major cities they say we follow their orders only 20
[12:55.360 --> 13:00.000]  percent of us are going to die this is an incredibly chilling document america still
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.160]  unprepared america still in danger report on the independent task force sponsored by the council
[13:04.160 --> 13:09.760]  on foreign relations and these are all the carol group of people these are all the names you expose
[13:09.760 --> 13:14.320]  yeah alex i know the council foreign relations is always doing a great job of saving us from ourselves
[13:14.320 --> 13:20.400]  um and in a democracy i prefer the vote to be counseled well certainly in our constitutional
[13:20.400 --> 13:26.960]  republic but what i'm trying to say here greg is palace is that what's in the inf plan for total
[13:26.960 --> 13:31.760]  takeover by the international banks is exactly what's in this 40 page report yeah it's the same
[13:31.760 --> 13:35.920]  group in fact stiglitz told me you know he would say sit around with people in the u.s treasure
[13:35.920 --> 13:39.760]  he can remember also joe stiglitz who was the chief economist the world bank he was in clinton's
[13:39.760 --> 13:44.800]  cabinet as the chairman of the council of economic advisors and he'd say uh some of these
[13:44.800 --> 13:49.360]  top guys at treasury i can't give you the names he gave me but you'd recognize him uh would sit
[13:49.360 --> 13:54.560]  around and say well does this policy how how does this policy float with city bank it literally
[13:54.560 --> 13:59.200]  sitting there you know the treasury department you know like it's like he's saying these guys didn't
[13:59.200 --> 14:03.920]  even hear themselves and understand what they were saying or maybe they didn't they just got so used
[14:03.920 --> 14:10.160]  to it he says this one is that the touchstone of of of our domestic and foreign economic
[14:10.160 --> 14:14.800]  policies how it plays with city bank they actually believe in this stuff i mean that's one thing you
[14:14.800 --> 14:18.480]  have to understand they believe that they are really saving us i don't believe it that they're
[14:18.480 --> 14:23.840]  doing just because they're they're um it does make them all very rich like robert rubin i think
[14:23.840 --> 14:28.960]  he's making 100 million dollars a year he goes from the u.s treasury to city bank and he doesn't
[14:28.960 --> 14:34.080]  see that as a conflict he sees that as helping the world uh well these are just managers yeah
[14:34.080 --> 14:39.280]  they're the chosen ones they need to run our lives and then they're the operators um but
[14:39.280 --> 14:44.400]  right they don't they're not the owners but what i should uh mention reading reports like they're
[14:44.400 --> 14:48.640]  repercussions for us i mean i don't care if these guys are running around trying to run our planet
[14:48.640 --> 14:54.000]  if they did a good job of it uh the problem is for example when they when the imf world bank
[14:54.000 --> 14:59.120]  seized on the economy of turkey and i just got their turkish internal report that's secret
[14:59.120 --> 15:04.880]  the problem is is that they've destroyed the economy by um raising and requiring the nation
[15:04.880 --> 15:09.120]  to raise interest rates through the roof imagine if you had a credit card purchase that cost you
[15:09.120 --> 15:16.400]  250 exactly what would you buy tomorrow so that destroys an economy the economy starts going down
[15:16.400 --> 15:21.760]  and today an islamic party this weekend an islamic party was just elected to power in turkey
[15:21.760 --> 15:26.480]  and every single reports is the same thing the people there don't care about uh you know the
[15:26.480 --> 15:31.440]  islamic fundamentalist but they're so tired of being impoverished by the current leaders going
[15:31.440 --> 15:36.720]  along with the world bank plan that they turn to the islamic parties unfortunately turn to
[15:36.720 --> 15:42.080]  the islamic parties and that comes back to to haunt the rest of the planet so they're
[15:42.080 --> 15:47.840]  repercussions now let's understand because in two past reports and in your book and the interview
[15:47.840 --> 15:52.480]  that you did that we did of course posted a transcript on your site it's gone worldwide as
[15:52.480 --> 15:57.680]  you said and published in many newspapers um mr palace they admit though that they want to
[15:57.680 --> 16:02.000]  destabilize countries so they can't pay back the debt i mean isn't that part of a four-part plan
[16:02.000 --> 16:07.840]  oh yeah yeah they want to uh i mean they don't they wouldn't say to themselves so we can become
[16:07.840 --> 16:12.160]  rich what they say is well if there's a little instability which is matched by what they call
[16:12.160 --> 16:19.040]  resolve meaning troops in the street um then there'll be no no visible descent to our programs
[16:19.040 --> 16:23.760]  to what they would call rationalize the economies which is to turn them over but like in the case of
[16:23.760 --> 16:30.320]  of argentina the water systems were turned over to enron corporation and vivendi corporation well
[16:30.880 --> 16:38.320]  uh of france uh used to be called lienes de zou um and enron took the bueno ferrari water system
[16:38.320 --> 16:43.040]  and the assets disappeared the all the workers are fired the pipes started breaking the water
[16:43.040 --> 16:48.880]  was contaminated the bills went up and until there were of course people in the streets throwing rocks
[16:48.880 --> 16:57.200]  and burning cars so it has repercussions because it comes back to us then enron implodes and the
[16:57.200 --> 17:03.360]  united states taxpayer is now on the hook for the cost in argentina you know that our that our
[17:03.360 --> 17:08.720]  government treasury is now going to have to pay for the cost of repairing the argentine system
[17:08.720 --> 17:13.280]  that enron wrecked and i don't know where they took off with with the millions if not billions
[17:13.280 --> 17:17.440]  of dollars older came an island offshore accounts we know that they just imploded that as a dummy
[17:17.440 --> 17:22.400]  corporation and then transferred the actual wealth before the implosion i mean the problem is is that
[17:22.400 --> 17:28.480]  we are backing up through our export import bank through our guarantees through our export guarantee
[17:28.480 --> 17:34.560]  corporations it's u.s taxpayer money what are we going to hit on when we get back greg what are
[17:34.560 --> 17:41.520]  some of the points real quick tuesday stealing the election and the saudis our buddies all right stay

[18:13.040 --> 18:18.960]  talking to award-winning journalist from the bbc and author greg palace here on the show with us
[18:18.960 --> 18:23.440]  we're about to go to eleanor richard and others that are holding toll-free number to join us on
[18:23.440 --> 18:33.280]  air 1-800-259-9231 if you have any questions or comments for greg palace 1-800-259-9231
[18:33.280 --> 18:38.320]  uh greg one more quick question about the water i remember seeing articles through the pr firms
[18:38.320 --> 18:42.480]  the mainstream media that there's no fresh water you're gonna have to pay hundreds of dollars now
[18:42.480 --> 18:47.200]  for what would cost dollars years ago and then if i watch these international corporations that own
[18:47.200 --> 18:52.160]  the central banks grabbing up all the water supplies worldwide trying to make farmers put
[18:52.160 --> 18:58.720]  meters on their wells and in very temperate areas with lots of water with aquifers brimming and we
[18:58.720 --> 19:04.960]  see this consolidation this really is fascism they socialize the wealth and transfer it through a
[19:04.960 --> 19:10.160]  wealth pipeline and pun intended to for themselves i mean how does this whole water thing work
[19:10.160 --> 19:14.800]  it's water you know the water pirates are just amazing and by the way here's a great one for
[19:14.800 --> 19:19.760]  you know who's one of their big buddies is jeb bush out of florida he was behind a scheme to
[19:19.760 --> 19:25.200]  turn over to a company named azurex the fresh water that comes out of the everglades which
[19:25.200 --> 19:30.560]  right now anyone any of the cities can can take the fresh water from the everglades without cost
[19:30.560 --> 19:37.440]  to consumers um at the moment the water is being contaminated by uh plantation sugar plantations
[19:37.440 --> 19:44.080]  the fran hool family or the fond family and big big contributors to the bush family and by the
[19:44.080 --> 19:48.480]  way to the democratic party they are the biggest contributors to both parties in florida isn't that
[19:48.480 --> 19:54.160]  interesting and those guys who are destroying the water the everglades rather than being told to
[19:54.160 --> 20:00.240]  clean up their act which would cost them about 800 million dollars instead this company azurex
[20:00.240 --> 20:06.080]  said well you give us the water we'll clean it up as long as you let us resell it azurex was until
[20:06.080 --> 20:13.280]  the until a couple months ago 100 own subsidiary of enron as if they own water that was already
[20:13.280 --> 20:18.240]  there meanwhile they're forcing the families and the neighborhoods out saying they're going to
[20:18.240 --> 20:22.960]  flood their land and using the phony environmental movement to clean them off the land so they can
[20:22.960 --> 20:26.880]  own it when they're the ones actually hurting the environment it's just it's so classic
[20:27.440 --> 20:31.840]  yeah i'm very effectively concerned because i saw this happen in britain where the water was
[20:31.840 --> 20:37.840]  privatized and the water bill was one of 250 percent enron took a big company took over a
[20:37.840 --> 20:42.240]  big company called ethics water um it got to the point where it was you could get arrested in
[20:42.240 --> 20:46.960]  britain for watering your lawn during certain weeks now let's understand this you know they
[20:46.960 --> 20:51.360]  call it privatization but it's not it's like hitler saying all right herman gurring we're
[20:51.360 --> 20:57.040]  going to privatize this uh you know this factory you own it now i mean that's all they're doing
[20:57.040 --> 21:01.280]  this is not free market well you know the guy that ordered the privatizations in britain is a
[21:01.280 --> 21:08.320]  guy named lord west excuse me lord wakeham what a character uh he um and he's been on he was on
[21:08.320 --> 21:13.520]  the audit committee of the board of directors of enron and and yet here's a guy who was the
[21:13.520 --> 21:18.880]  guy who sold enron the water system sold enron the electric systems of britain and was supposedly in
[21:18.880 --> 21:23.040]  charge of monitoring their books on their board of directors and again he's the head of nm ron
[21:23.040 --> 21:29.840]  shaw and uh you know and and also uh this you know uh wake me up he's uh connected to most of
[21:29.840 --> 21:35.360]  the major international thanks plus even he's uh actually a voting member of the house of lords
[21:36.000 --> 21:40.160]  so you know uh he doesn't miss the trick so these are the guys who are you know making these
[21:40.160 --> 21:44.320]  wonderful decisions do i trust their decisions are they looking out for the interest of the
[21:44.320 --> 21:48.880]  average person i have a few doubts about that well my point is they really fund the phony
[21:48.880 --> 21:53.040]  mainstream environmental movement they use it to grab people's land while they're the ones
[21:53.040 --> 21:58.240]  putting the mvt in the fuel they're the ones dumping the toxic waste in the ocean and then
[21:58.240 --> 22:02.880]  they're going oh we got to save the environment take everybody's ranch property well i'm very
[22:02.960 --> 22:07.360]  concerned that there are you know that there's a huge misdirection sometimes in the environmental
[22:07.360 --> 22:11.840]  movement not looking to the corporate powers which are grabbing these properties and we did
[22:11.840 --> 22:16.480]  have some problems with i think some in green groups who thought it would be brilliant to use
[22:16.480 --> 22:21.760]  what they call market mechanisms to uh save the environment like raising the price of water to
[22:21.760 --> 22:27.200]  uh to ranchers and to uh the farmers it just so happens that these international corporations are
[22:27.200 --> 22:31.200]  going to own that water yeah and the problem is that you raise the price and all that does is
[22:31.200 --> 22:35.680]  allow these these uh the power the water and power pirates come in and seize the power there
[22:35.680 --> 22:40.880]  you go now now greg palace i know you study this in depth i i'm seeing democrats just got
[22:40.880 --> 22:45.120]  caught here in austin revving the electronic voting machine was in our paper thursday i
[22:45.120 --> 22:50.400]  never even covered it uh you've got lots of little democratic scams going on down at the
[22:50.400 --> 22:55.200]  micro level uh the democrats have become the the it's very interesting what i say is that
[22:55.200 --> 22:59.200]  the democrats have perfected retail votes stealing and the republicans are perfecting
[22:59.200 --> 23:02.640]  wholesale votes stealing there you go break it down they've kind of divided they've kind
[23:02.640 --> 23:08.480]  of divided the market and vote fraud um exactly they have their own monopoly but what the
[23:08.480 --> 23:14.320]  interesting one of course that'll be significant is in florida where where brother jeb is running
[23:14.320 --> 23:20.560]  for his life for reelection and i had uncovered before the presidential election for bbc television
[23:20.560 --> 23:27.600]  uh in 2000 that uh jeb bush and catherine harris had knocked off i thought 57 000 now by the way
[23:28.160 --> 23:35.280]  harris says it was 94 000 people off the voter rolls most of them uh africa or about half of
[23:35.280 --> 23:41.760]  them african-american most of them democrats and um and now she has signed an agreement with the
[23:41.760 --> 23:47.200]  courts of florida to return these people to the voter rolls there's tens of thousands of voters
[23:47.200 --> 23:53.200]  but guess what they're not going to be able to do it by tuesday's election to jeb bush when jeb
[23:53.200 --> 23:58.720]  bush is on the ballot so you're going to see tens of thousands of voters mostly democrats about half
[23:58.720 --> 24:03.200]  of them african-american not permitted to vote in the tuesday election which is going to be a squeaker
[24:03.200 --> 24:09.680]  by absolutely everyone's analysis like i you have the right point there is no monopoly of any party
[24:09.680 --> 24:13.440]  on vote theft it's just that in florida the republicans have complete control of the yeah
[24:14.960 --> 24:19.360]  you stop the ballot boxes run the scams at the county level even in republican counties i don't
[24:19.360 --> 24:22.640]  know how they get away with them we've caught them several times here in austin but then at
[24:22.640 --> 24:27.600]  the national level the republicans do it from the very seats of power well the republicans
[24:27.600 --> 24:31.600]  are more sophisticated i actually talked to terry macaulay the head of the democratic party
[24:31.600 --> 24:37.040]  the republicans have figured out how to use computers and and are pushing towards computerizing
[24:37.040 --> 24:42.320]  all the voting systems of america that came out in what is called weirdly the martin luther king
[24:42.320 --> 24:47.840]  voting reform act of 2002 i'm sure dr king is spinning in his grave chuckie schumer's
[24:47.840 --> 24:52.240]  co-sponsoring that which shows that some of the democrats are i know i'm very nervous because you
[24:52.240 --> 24:57.680]  know it is it's really an incumbent uh reelection insurance plan the democrats like it and
[24:57.680 --> 25:02.320]  republicans like it who are in office because for example the new york democrats control the
[25:02.320 --> 25:06.800]  voting machinery in many areas so they don't mind centralized computing where they can monkey with
[25:06.800 --> 25:10.880]  the vote and the republicans certainly like it in florida where they control the machinery
[25:10.880 --> 25:15.360]  so the incumbent politicians teams have gotten together and shook hands on a system which will
[25:15.360 --> 25:20.560]  keep the incumbents incumbent uh the problem is that once you centralize once you have these
[25:20.560 --> 25:27.120]  massive central computerized voting systems including control of the registries with zero
[25:27.920 --> 25:34.240]  with zero checks and balances well let's put it this way florida just uh used um uh the what's
[25:34.240 --> 25:39.840]  called a company called efns the new voting machines the touch screen voting in some offices
[25:39.840 --> 25:48.960]  you had 19 000 voters with 29 000 votes cast i mean you can you can have goof ups and manipulation
[25:49.520 --> 25:54.240]  and games played with computers on a scale that you can't imagine with the old games of you know
[25:54.240 --> 25:59.200]  filling out fake apps well as of as of thursdays austin american states when there were eight
[25:59.200 --> 26:06.560]  signed affidavits now there's over 500 i'm told where at one voting center uh at one atb here at
[26:06.560 --> 26:11.920]  austin grocery store voting area you go in the democrat election judges say here just press this
[26:11.920 --> 26:16.960]  especially to uh hispanics you can't speak english they press and vote straight democratic tickets
[26:17.520 --> 26:21.440]  now that's just local level and that's confirmed and nothing's going to be done about it
[26:22.160 --> 26:26.960]  well because the incumbents in each party who have control of their own little areas it's kind
[26:26.960 --> 26:30.880]  of like a wink and nod we don't we don't uh question what you're doing you know the most
[26:30.880 --> 26:36.080]  amazing thing about florida is that while the n-double-a-cp has sued over the removal of these
[26:36.080 --> 26:41.680]  tens of thousands of black voters innocent people uh removed from the voter rolls on the ground by
[26:41.680 --> 26:46.480]  the way that they are felons who committed crimes i had one guy i actually have out of
[26:46.480 --> 26:50.800]  i was able to obtain the actual computer files from catherine harris's office
[26:50.800 --> 26:56.000]  the actual computer files you have people there's one guy named thomas cooper that shows him
[26:56.000 --> 27:04.480]  convicted on january 30th 2007 this is the type of junk that they used to knock people out it's all
[27:04.480 --> 27:08.240]  it's all garbage right and they admit it's garbage the company that came up with the list
[27:08.800 --> 27:14.160]  uh said it was garbage the company made and announced that they will never do this again
[27:14.160 --> 27:19.200]  you can't do this stuff honestly with computers and don't forget that there's a connection between
[27:19.200 --> 27:24.560]  the computerization of the voter rolls and the computerization of the so-called anti-terrorism
[27:24.560 --> 27:30.560]  records the same company that is that computerized the voter rolls in florida and and uh basically
[27:30.560 --> 27:35.840]  led to this massive vote fraud in florida that's going to happen on tuesday it's called choice
[27:35.840 --> 27:42.160]  point out of atlanta they are the number one beneficiary of the war on terror ford's mag that's
[27:42.160 --> 27:46.560]  a quote from the from ford's magazine by the way we said we don't know who's lost the war on terror
[27:46.560 --> 27:52.640]  but we know who's won choice point company which has 20 billion records on every living person in
[27:52.640 --> 27:59.120]  the united states 20 billion records including by the way they're building a national dna database
[27:59.680 --> 28:04.480]  now i i don't know about you but i don't feel safer from terrorists when the united states
[28:04.560 --> 28:11.360]  government has a dna database wired magazine reported that hundreds of grocery stores dozens
[28:11.360 --> 28:18.480]  of chains have put presser sensors under the tiles on the floor biometric face scanning cameras and
[28:18.480 --> 28:24.480]  microphones this is in hundreds of stores right now and they are building digital algorithms
[28:24.480 --> 28:30.320]  psychological outlays by your purchases by how long you linger by what you do then they instantly
[28:30.320 --> 28:36.640]  upload your credit card purchases into an nsa databank that's wired magazine i mean this is
[28:36.640 --> 28:42.720]  going past big brother oh you have to attend the new anti-terrorism law has a provision which i
[28:42.720 --> 28:49.360]  found very uh that concerned me greatly uh for the first time uh the u.s justice department will be
[28:49.360 --> 28:56.080]  entitled to access private databases like this company choice point and they can share and and
[28:56.640 --> 29:00.320]  you know it used to be that you had to go to court you know the constitution on your fifth amendment
[29:00.320 --> 29:05.200]  says you have to go get a warrant to get in uh to break into people's homes in effect well breaking
[29:05.200 --> 29:10.240]  into a private database the uh the courts used to say that's the equivalent of breaking into
[29:10.240 --> 29:16.080]  someone's home and now under the anti-terrorism bill u.s justice department has the right to kind
[29:16.080 --> 29:21.360]  of go leaking through computer files without a warrant well the sneak and peek provision section
[29:21.360 --> 29:26.080]  213 says they can do it in your actual home business library and then order you if you
[29:26.080 --> 29:31.200]  catch them there to not tell anyone i'm very concerned about this especially with choice
[29:31.200 --> 29:36.560]  points in its dna database because i don't like the combination of the fact that this is the
[29:36.560 --> 29:42.080]  company that through its database manipulation of the voter rolls in florida they in effect
[29:42.080 --> 29:46.480]  my computer chose our president and now he's chosen them for the biggest contracts under
[29:46.480 --> 29:51.120]  the anti-terrorism by the way i have a report here out of ohio where they're going door to
[29:51.120 --> 29:56.480]  door to collect blood samples and just asking people to do it they're now taking blood from
[29:56.480 --> 30:01.600]  all babies in all the major states and mentally putting it into this database will you wear that
[30:01.600 --> 30:06.160]  yeah well you know they're doing this they're saying for example like choice point this company
[30:06.160 --> 30:10.960]  that that collected our president now they're making billions they're doing things like they
[30:10.960 --> 30:17.760]  got a big play on abc television saying they've that they've been able to spring innocent men
[30:17.760 --> 30:23.280]  from jail with committed rape because they use their dna uh or excuse the committing rate because
[30:23.280 --> 30:28.000]  they use the dna database to prove that they're innocent they use a couple good good good things
[30:28.000 --> 30:32.720]  that they use at the database or that they find a missing child through the uni database so
[30:32.720 --> 30:38.160]  everyone says oh yeah take my baby's blood well you know before you do that um there's nothing
[30:38.160 --> 30:42.000]  unless they give you a contract that says this will only be used in case your child is missing
[30:42.000 --> 30:46.480]  or lost and you agree to release this information well the supreme court has ruled that they can
[30:46.480 --> 30:52.560]  take that blood get a protein out of it or a genetic system and then patent it oh yeah
[30:52.560 --> 30:58.880]  well they can frame you with it well the problem is i i just think that you know there's the the
[30:58.880 --> 31:05.200]  new expansion of using the cover of anti-terrorism to break into our personal files lives and even
[31:05.200 --> 31:10.640]  our dna sequences i just worry whether that actually makes us a lot safer and you know what
[31:10.640 --> 31:15.440]  we're not doing it on the other side of the coin is our buddies the saudis who this week announced
[31:15.440 --> 31:19.760]  that if we do attack Iraq they're not going to give us any help let's talk about that in a second

[32:36.400 --> 32:44.800]  beyond the shadow of a doubt that w 1999 is a is a legitimate document um the the book i'm going to
[32:44.800 --> 32:49.120]  have it in the updated version of my book an actual copy of these documents well you have
[32:49.520 --> 32:55.840]  it but there is but there is right now there's a book uh by um called the the forbidden truth
[32:55.840 --> 33:00.400]  which was just put out in its english edition which has added some of these documents all
[33:00.400 --> 33:08.000]  w199 says is that the it shows that the usfbi had closed and then on september 13th of 2001
[33:08.000 --> 33:13.040]  two days after tech and world trade center reopened an investigation of the bin laden
[33:13.440 --> 33:19.200]  indicating that the investigation had been previously shut down look i read the document
[33:19.200 --> 33:25.600]  here on air the thing is online it was it was in nine major newspapers you can go to infowars.com
[33:25.600 --> 33:30.800]  print it off you've got the government blocking investigations of al-qaeda of the bin ladens of
[33:30.800 --> 33:37.200]  hamas we've got fbi agent robert right we've got judicial watch head larry klayman and uh
[33:37.200 --> 33:41.680]  david shippers at the national press club giving an hour-long press coverage of how they were
[33:41.680 --> 33:46.320]  blocked from stopping al-qaeda and hijackers at bases that's been all over the news so i
[33:46.320 --> 33:51.520]  should also mention that there's a massive suit brought by uh the uh the attorney um
[33:52.880 --> 33:58.960]  not me uh and i think it's richard miley uh but it's a multi-trillion dollar suit against
[33:58.960 --> 34:03.920]  for the victims of september 11th against the saudi government and the new york time just
[34:03.920 --> 34:08.240]  reported that's being thrown out uh yes because the u.s government is stepping in not because
[34:08.240 --> 34:11.920]  there's not evidence but the u.s government is stepping in saying that the lawsuit is a threat
[34:11.920 --> 34:16.640]  to u.s national security now finding out who killed the people like people on september 11th
[34:16.640 --> 34:21.920]  or who backed al-qaeda who backed these terrorists and gave them money it strikes me that that's in
[34:21.920 --> 34:28.400]  the interest of our national security um as opposed to um because what this what the lawsuit
[34:28.400 --> 34:33.120]  was saying and it used some material i had and what i was very appreciative is that by the way
[34:33.120 --> 34:38.880]  french intelligence has now confirmed um some of the things that that i had been informed of
[34:38.880 --> 34:47.280]  for example in may of 1996 there was a meeting of the al-qaeda financial arm with saudi arabian
[34:47.280 --> 34:53.200]  billionaires to determine how much money will come will go from saudi arabia to the billionaires and
[34:53.840 --> 35:01.040]  to al-qaeda and which billionaires will pay what well on june 6th on june 6 2001 the la times
[35:01.040 --> 35:07.840]  reported bush sent 135 million more to the taliban and al-qaeda right then that was uh
[35:07.840 --> 35:14.560]  supposedly for their um move to eradicate opium yeah right in afghanistan you know of course
[35:15.600 --> 35:19.840]  they don't use the money for uh you know torturing their uh their fellow citizens
[35:19.840 --> 35:23.840]  but in the case what i'm very concerned about was the saudi funding of the al-qaeda network
[35:23.840 --> 35:30.480]  now i had mentioned that on alex's show last year i had gotten that information from not the best
[35:30.480 --> 35:35.040]  of sources not the most savory sources from i got that from international arms dealers who
[35:35.040 --> 35:41.280]  were involved in the meeting um now as it now turns out the french intelligence has confirmed
[35:41.280 --> 35:45.760]  the meeting and not only that but i've discovered the french intelligence actually had a mole in the
[35:45.760 --> 35:49.360]  meeting and we now have the information from i want to hear about that maybe when we get back
[35:49.360 --> 35:52.320]  i hope that answers your question richard final segment with greg palace coming up
[35:52.320 --> 36:01.680]  don't worry this show is documented alex jones on the gcn radio network
[36:05.520 --> 36:15.040]  all right the best democracy money can buy has two pages of w 1999 and he said that the new edition
[36:15.040 --> 36:20.000]  coming out here in the next few months in the united states will have more of the documents but
[36:20.080 --> 36:27.760]  i mean bbc times of london french news indian news it all reported it bush news bush blocked
[36:27.760 --> 36:34.320]  fbi you know headlines like that you can go read those stories on info wars.com in the uh in the
[36:34.320 --> 36:40.400]  bush news section so you can just simply uh go check that out or find out more at gregpalace.com
[36:40.400 --> 36:44.480]  they posted more of those documents up there greg i know i've been running over you a lot you've
[36:44.480 --> 36:49.040]  said a lot there's just so many points to hit here in the last few minutes any other key areas you
[36:49.040 --> 36:54.320]  want to head on wow i'm like i said i'm concerned about this uh vote theft on tuesday i'm concerned
[36:54.320 --> 36:58.400]  that if we go into iraq look out for 48 hours later that they're going to assassinate the
[36:58.400 --> 37:02.720]  president of venezuela talk about saddam but it's venezuela that they want and by the way i want to
[37:02.720 --> 37:07.200]  tie in a couple these things they all tie up together these stories you know which is that
[37:09.280 --> 37:18.720]  when in the case of venezuela we are looking at a president who is descended from the new
[37:18.720 --> 37:24.560]  globalization order and that's why they call him a communist and a dictator etc as one of his
[37:24.560 --> 37:29.920]  ministers said we are the people who've descended from the imf and the world bank they cannot let
[37:29.920 --> 37:36.080]  this man survive well so is malaysia too well yeah malaysia other other countries have said
[37:36.080 --> 37:42.960]  uh forget it but but they have been uh um they've gotten away because they have other financial
[37:42.960 --> 37:47.120]  resources and they don't have a couple trillion dollars those sweet crude they're sitting on yeah
[37:47.200 --> 37:51.280]  and so you know if you're sitting on the oil you're sitting on a powder keg and so that's
[37:51.280 --> 37:54.960]  the danger i would look out always look for the news that they're not telling you about they're
[37:54.960 --> 37:57.920]  telling you about iraq you better look at the other side of the globe and see what the real
[37:57.920 --> 38:02.480]  agenda is i agree so iraq's being used as a massive smokescreen for the economy imploding
[38:02.480 --> 38:07.440]  the imf world bank moving assassinations coup d'etats and police stay here domestically that's
[38:07.440 --> 38:12.080]  the weapon of iraq is the weapon of mass distraction you know they just want to take
[38:12.080 --> 38:17.280]  your eye off the ball now they're saying iraq greg you're saying iraq's going to attack us
[38:17.280 --> 38:22.960]  for sure when we attack them i'd say that's going to be a cia op well what i'm very concerned about
[38:22.960 --> 38:29.040]  is is our again my concern is the lack of investigation of our so-called buddies the saudis
[38:29.040 --> 38:34.480]  they gave i by the way my new book will will be discussing the fact that the saudis fact the um
[38:34.480 --> 38:42.560]  the creation of the islamic bomb and when i asked uh the cia agents and the fbi agents exactly what
[38:42.560 --> 38:47.120]  investigations were killed by bush before september 11th don't just tell me that investigations are
[38:47.120 --> 38:51.680]  killed give me an example and specifically it was something that one of the investigations was
[38:51.680 --> 38:57.920]  of khan industries khan industries is the kind of private company which actually put together the
[38:57.920 --> 39:03.680]  atomic bomb for pakistan now we've got a nutcase dictator islamic fundamentalist dictator in
[39:03.680 --> 39:08.800]  pakistan he's become george bush's best friend but this guy's actually threatened to use atomic
[39:08.800 --> 39:12.400]  bombs and then the head of the intelligence committee wires a hundred thousand dollars to
[39:12.400 --> 39:17.840]  mohammed atta he's meeting with porter gosh and uh graham the morning of september 11th eating
[39:17.840 --> 39:22.640]  breakfast this whole thing rigs of a takeover 30 seconds left what about this french meeting what
[39:22.640 --> 39:27.600]  did they say uh with their mole inside this meeting with the global intelligence intelligence
[39:27.760 --> 39:34.160]  confirmed that that the saudis had agreed to give money to al-qaeda and by the way that the terrible
[39:34.160 --> 39:38.560]  thing is because apparently they were slow in paying off al-qaeda that's why our marines were
[39:38.560 --> 39:43.840]  killed at the cobar towers it was a little uh delinquency payment you know delinquent payment
[39:43.840 --> 39:50.320]  notice all right greg palace came up the great work greg palace.com hope to get you back on soon
