[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  Waging War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20.000 --> 00:31.000]  Live, we are broadcasting worldwide. There is an incredibly important article up on Infowars.com of absolute biblical proportions.
[00:31.000 --> 00:38.000]  A creator of Bioweapons Act says coronavirus is a biological warfare weapon.
[00:38.000 --> 00:44.000]  And that's of course Dr. Francis Boyle, who authored the U.S. Bioweapons Convention.
[00:44.000 --> 00:49.000]  He's going to come on tomorrow and give us his exclusive second big interview.
[00:49.000 --> 00:54.000]  He's teaching class right now. We're going to be breaking all of this down.
[00:54.000 --> 01:06.000]  Now, you already have the big Indian Scientific Technical Institute that does this, that maps viruses, scanning it, saying it's got the original HIV delivery system welded into it.
[01:06.000 --> 01:12.000]  Not HIV. No, ladies and gentlemen, the delivery system of HIV.
[01:12.000 --> 01:23.000]  And a lot of other things welded into it, and they have found the gene remnants that is always there when they insert a gene.
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  There is a fingerprint, or basically the shell casing is really how it's described.
[01:29.000 --> 01:41.000]  So they know with these electron microscopes and these systems they've got that can get down to the size of genes, but it leaves a trace like everything in this universe.
[01:41.000 --> 01:48.000]  It leaves footprints that don't just disappear, but that are there in time.
[01:48.000 --> 01:56.000]  And so then you saw the media go, oh, Info Wars and Mike Adams specifically, you know, media matters and vice.
[01:56.000 --> 02:02.000]  They're hyping all this up saying it could be manmade saying, oh, look at this.
[02:02.000 --> 02:06.000]  But then it of course turns out that's what all the evidence shows.
[02:06.000 --> 02:11.000]  We've been focusing on things days and weeks before the media ever even gets around to it.
[02:11.000 --> 02:16.000]  And then the media would spend it saying that we were saying that it was HIV.
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  We never said that. Or that we just made it up.
[02:19.000 --> 02:23.000]  No, this was a major technical institute that came out. They didn't retract it.
[02:23.000 --> 02:26.000]  They just pulled it, though, under World Health Organization pressure.
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.000]  So I've been really focusing on this.
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.000]  I was supposed to be on a vacation.
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.000]  I haven't had one really over a year. I've canceled four of them with my wife.
[02:35.000 --> 02:38.000]  But I've been working the whole time here and I am going to come back to Austin.
[02:38.000 --> 02:40.000]  So everybody just needs to know that.
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.000]  We've got Owen Troyer coming up. He's going to be riding shotgun here.
[02:45.000 --> 02:48.000]  So there's any Skype problems. Mike Adams is going to be hosting.
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  And I'm going to give him much of the floor in this hour to kind of tie together because he is an engineer
[02:53.000 --> 02:59.000]  and also runs a big chemical, biological testing facility and has a lot of people that he's talking to.
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.000]  And there's a lot of top virologists and scientists, not just Dr. Francis Boyle coming out and saying,
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  this is a bio weapon that the Chinese probably stole from Canada.
[03:08.000 --> 03:14.000]  We know they did steal it out of Canada. They were weaponizing it and it got loose.
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  We were hoping, well, maybe it was just a vaccine. They were testing. They got loose.
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  No, it's a bio weapons situation. That's 98% now.
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.000]  I mean, it's very clear and that's why they're freaking out so bad.
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  And that's why the death toll has been suppressed, but now it's mounting and they can't cover it up.
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  And it looks like it is really bad.
[03:32.000 --> 03:38.000]  And that's why we were right to say two weeks ago, hey, institutional groups are buying up the food
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.000]  and they're buying up the medicine and corporations are.
[03:41.000 --> 03:47.000]  And we got that intel to you show that the establishment is indeed actually very, very scared of this virus.
[03:47.000 --> 03:50.000]  It spreads very quickly. It mutates very fast.
[03:50.000 --> 03:54.000]  And it's got a bunch of nasty stuff that's been welded onto it.
[03:54.000 --> 03:57.000]  So it's synthetic. All evidence points to that.
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.000]  And there's been an attempt to cover it up and we've seen this big, giant global suppression drill,
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  this big global UN world government promotion drill out of this.
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.000]  You've seen governments really in lockstep, but now that Trump started restricting flights from China to the U.S.,
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  which you should have done even earlier, in my humble opinion, the Chinese government's criticizing Trump,
[04:16.000 --> 04:23.000]  even though they're not criticizing Russia or others totally banning Chinese coming in out of there.
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  And now Trump's bad and America needs to receive this.
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  That's why I talked to Mike Adams last night and he says evidence is mounting.
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  It's a bio weapon that did get released. It was supposed to be targeted at the United States.
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  So we know China is developing bio weapons.
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  And we know, of course, ladies and gentlemen, that that is the Wuhan province is the main place doing it.
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.000]  You've got the very labs that have the very umbrella corporation symbol.
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  You can't make up the bizarreness of all of this.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  So we'll lay it out with Mike Adams straight ahead.
[04:50.000 --> 04:56.000]  And we've got Dr. Francis Boyle joining us exclusively tomorrow in the second hour. Stay with us.
[04:59.000 --> 05:02.000]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Info War.
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.000]  But I know you're like me. You don't want my thanks.
[05:05.000 --> 05:09.000]  You want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters.
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.000]  You want them off your back and off your children's back.
[05:11.000 --> 05:15.000]  You know what? I'm the same way. And that's why we're on the same damn team.
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.000]  And it's why Info Wars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time
[05:20.000 --> 05:24.000]  to focus the people on taking action against the globalist.
[05:24.000 --> 05:28.000]  Because I'm committed to a future for humanity.
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  And I know you are as well.
[05:30.000 --> 05:34.000]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the Info War.
[05:34.000 --> 05:38.000]  And I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.000]  For the bottom of my heart, for my family and for the great crew at Info Wars,
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000]  I want to thank you all because you are the Info War.
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  And you know that's not just words. That's reality.
[05:48.000 --> 05:51.000]  You have made history. We have made history together.
[05:51.000 --> 05:56.000]  InfoWars.com only has power because of you.
[05:56.000 --> 05:58.000]  And I suggest you use it.
[06:00.000 --> 06:01.000]  We've got it.
[06:01.000 --> 06:03.000]  That transmission is coming to you.
[06:07.000 --> 06:10.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[06:10.000 --> 06:17.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[06:25.000 --> 06:32.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Worldwide Tuesday broadcast.
[06:32.000 --> 06:36.000]  Owen Schreuer is in the Info Wars News Center in Austin, Texas.
[06:36.000 --> 06:42.000]  And he's going to be bringing us out of breaks today. Mike Adams is about to take over for much of this hour.
[06:42.000 --> 06:48.000]  Next hour we're going to play big clips of Dr. Francis Boyle speaking to International Television Group
[06:48.000 --> 06:53.000]  about the fact that this is clearly a Chinese bio weapon that got loose.
[06:53.000 --> 06:57.000]  Francis Boyle has an impeccable reputation for integrity.
[06:57.000 --> 07:03.000]  And he authored the U.S. Bioweapons Act that was then put into the UN Treaty.
[07:03.000 --> 07:07.000]  He says coronavirus is biological warfare weapon.
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  Who knows full well what is occurring.
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.000]  He'll be with us live tomorrow in the second hour.
[07:13.000 --> 07:20.000]  I have had a lot of stuff going on here behind the scenes and obviously happening in the world.
[07:20.000 --> 07:23.000]  But I am going to be back in Austin very, very soon.
[07:23.000 --> 07:29.000]  I'm going to cut this short work occasion down to nothing to my wife's displeasure.
[07:29.000 --> 07:30.000]  But that's just the way it is.
[07:30.000 --> 07:32.000]  Things are just too intense.
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  But the crew is doing a great job.
[07:34.000 --> 07:38.000]  You'll also notice that a lot of other crazy things are happening.
[07:38.000 --> 07:46.000]  Rush Limbaugh announced, we'll play this clip later, that he has advanced stage lung cancer.
[07:46.000 --> 07:53.000]  And the left had a huge orgy-like conniption fit of pleasure that this was happening.
[07:53.000 --> 07:55.000]  Just truly disgusting people.
[07:55.000 --> 08:00.000]  And it just reminds us that we see these icons like Kobe Bryant or Rush Limbaugh.
[08:00.000 --> 08:03.000]  And you just think they're going to be there forever and sometimes they aren't.
[08:03.000 --> 08:09.000]  People we really care about or people that are in our lives because we watch and listen to them aren't always there.
[08:09.000 --> 08:13.000]  And in fact, people always end up dying in the end.
[08:13.000 --> 08:16.000]  And Rush Limbaugh has come a long way.
[08:16.000 --> 08:26.000]  Who he was 31 years ago on air was a maverick promoting conservatism and nationalism when it was totally unpopular and on its knees and under attack.
[08:26.000 --> 08:30.000]  And sure, he made a lot of mistakes along the way, promoted wars he shouldn't have.
[08:30.000 --> 08:36.000]  But in the end, in the last decade, he's really attacked the New World Order, the globalist structure, and come a long way.
[08:36.000 --> 08:43.000]  Once Imphal Wars and others paved the way for him to be able to have the courage to do that on the 600 radio stations he's on.
[08:43.000 --> 08:46.000]  And we wouldn't have turned the tide against the globalists without Rush Limbaugh.
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  We wouldn't have gotten Trump in without Rush Limbaugh.
[08:48.000 --> 08:56.000]  And a lot of people have called me saying, oh, you know, he's your main competition. Are you feeling good about this? That's sick.
[08:56.000 --> 08:57.000]  That's sick.
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  I'm not in Rush Limbaugh's slot because I ever wanted to be Rush Limbaugh.
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  That was the slot that nobody would go up against.
[09:02.000 --> 09:07.000]  23 years ago, they started syndicating my show on GCN.
[09:07.000 --> 09:09.000]  They said, we're going to put you on against Rush Limbaugh.
[09:09.000 --> 09:16.000]  I've already been hosting for years a weeknight show that was syndicated that was super popular from nine to midnight that a lot of you listen to.
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.000]  And I was like, no, I'm not going to do that slot.
[09:19.000 --> 09:24.000]  They said, well, we're not going to keep you employed here if you don't go up against Rush Limbaugh.
[09:24.000 --> 09:26.000]  And so I know I'm not police.
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  Rush Limbaugh is probably terminal.
[09:29.000 --> 09:30.000]  I mean, you heard him.
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.000]  He said, you know, I really feel guilty.
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.000]  Like I won't be able to stand the fight.
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  But the good news is it's not going to go very long.
[09:36.000 --> 09:37.000]  It's really bad.
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  And I kind of get what he's saying.
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  It's like, you know, this is he's going to fight.
[09:41.000 --> 09:47.000]  And he got tough, but he's just really feeling bad that he's not going to stay in the fight.
[09:47.000 --> 09:51.000]  So it's really disgusting news and really bad.
[09:51.000 --> 09:53.000]  Just sign of how crazy everything is.
[09:53.000 --> 10:01.000]  And we have a lot of huge stories to cover, obviously, but it's a big, big deal that he's got that lung cancer and that they're running around celebrating.
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  And I just am so sick of these people.
[10:03.000 --> 10:07.000]  I'm absolutely so tired of the new world order and their activities.
[10:07.000 --> 10:17.000]  So we're going to be laying all of this out, but the top story, the shocking truth about the coronavirus is slowly but surely starting to emerge.
[10:17.000 --> 10:18.000]  Creator of U.S.
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.000]  Bioweapons Act says coronavirus is biological warfare weapon.
[10:21.000 --> 10:24.000]  The who knows full well what is occurring.
[10:24.000 --> 10:35.000]  In an explosive interview, Dr. Francis Boyle, who drafted the Biological Weapons Act, has been given a detailed statement admitting that the 2019 Wuhan coronavirus is an offensive biological warfare weapon.
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  The World Health Organization already knows about it.
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.000]  He has all the sources in the U.N. and the U.S. government.
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  Francis Boyle is a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law.
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  He was drafted a U.S.
[10:46.000 --> 10:49.000]  domestic implementing legislation for biological weapons convention.
[10:49.000 --> 10:59.000]  There was the Biological Weapons Terrorism Act of 89 that was approved unanimously by the House of Representatives and Congress into law by President H.W. Bush.
[10:59.000 --> 11:05.000]  Discussive interviewing of the Biopolitics and Empire, Dr. Boyle discussed the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China.
[11:05.000 --> 11:11.000]  The biosafety level four laboratory, BSL-4, from which he believes the infectious disease escaped.
[11:11.000 --> 11:23.000]  He believes the virus is potentially lethal and an offensive biological warfare weapon or do use a warfare weapons agent genetically modified with a gain of function properties,
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.000]  which is why the Chinese government originally tried to cover it up and it's now taking drastic measures to contain it.
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  Let me go further.
[11:30.000 --> 11:46.000]  Major scientific institutions that we've already covered have scanned it and it's got the particular P Shuttle SN gene that is in all the literature only when they've gone in and injected an RNA into a virus to change it.
[11:46.000 --> 11:49.000]  So it's got the rim of the genetic engineering.
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.000]  This is absolutely what causes it.
[11:52.000 --> 11:57.000]  It's absolutely been lab manipulated.
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  And that's why you're seeing the total freak out.
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  The question is, how really lethal is it?
[12:01.000 --> 12:07.000]  Well, there's videos now emerging from China of just dead bodies, body bags piled up and people panicking running around.
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  And you can see these are real videos, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.000]  So something big is going on here.
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  She is China using this to control their populations.
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.000]  I think there's about to be an uprising.
[12:19.000 --> 12:27.000]  Mike Adams is about to take over here in just a few minutes and cover all of this and then Owen Schroyer is going to be there.
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.000]  And I'm going to be back popping in during the next hour and so much more.
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.000]  We're going to have the Limbaugh clip.
[12:33.000 --> 12:39.000]  We're going to have the clips of the Francis Boyle breaking down the origins of this and his contacts.
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.000]  We're going to have all of that coming up.
[12:42.000 --> 12:52.000]  And of course, your phone calls as well and I will be popping in and out and I'm behind the scenes working on major crises that are unfolding that I cannot at liberty to tell you about at this point.
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  You've also got what's happening in Iowa.
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.000]  Democrats always steal elections.
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  They don't have real elections in any blue cities.
[12:59.000 --> 13:00.000]  They were criminal fraud.
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.000]  Of course, they rigged the Iowa situation.
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  The Bernie Sanders wouldn't be on top.
[13:05.000 --> 13:10.000]  Of course, they used an app the Democrats agreed to use that then pushed out this info.
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.000]  This is the model of how they stole it for Hillary before.
[13:14.000 --> 13:21.000]  And notice now they want her as the VP so that then whoever gets in can step down and she's president because there's a call around this woman.
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.000]  And I kept telling you the different scenarios of how they could do this.
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  And here it is happening again.
[13:28.000 --> 13:29.000]  They show off the air.
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  The globalists are working around the clock to shut it down.
[13:32.000 --> 13:39.000]  That's why it's so vital for you to tell folks about those local AM and FM stations, local TV stations were on to ask stations that we aren't on.
[13:39.000 --> 13:46.000]  To put us on in other markets and to spread the word about band.video and newswars.com.
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.000]  That's how the truth gets out.
[13:48.000 --> 13:57.000]  And you notice major scientific institutions, biological, top experts, all of them are coming out and saying it's manmade.
[13:57.000 --> 13:58.000]  It's manmade.
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  Senator Cotton, he gets classified briefings.
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  He came out and said, OK, we need to look at this bio lab.
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.000]  That's the one we fingered a week and a half before with all of our experts.
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  Francis Boyle is like, why did you call me?
[14:09.000 --> 14:10.000]  I've been wanting to come on.
[14:10.000 --> 14:11.000]  I mean, he's a regular guest.
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  Why wasn't I thinking?
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  And boom, what is he saying?
[14:15.000 --> 14:16.000]  And he says he's talked to people inside.
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  They all know it.
[14:18.000 --> 14:24.000]  Just like the head UN scientist said, that scenes are killing people and we're covering it up in a video.
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.000]  They're covering their asses at the highest levels.
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  And now this has gotten out.
[14:30.000 --> 14:31.000]  But you heard what he's explaining.
[14:31.000 --> 14:37.000]  It could be the envelope this virus is the best weapon, the delivery system.
[14:37.000 --> 14:38.000]  You understand?
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  Like the powder that gets it down the range.
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  And that they add something else to it.
[14:42.000 --> 14:51.000]  And that they're hoping is that they've just had an escape of base virus that is also carried along with another virus.
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.000]  I'm not a virologist.
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  I'm just a research and have these people on.
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  And there's just all these advanced.
[14:57.000 --> 15:03.000]  So they've got viruses embedded in viruses and they've got viruses that then mutate out and create another system of viruses.
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.000]  And they've got all these mutagenic systems that are super advanced.
[15:06.000 --> 15:12.000]  We're not back in the 1920s when they learned how to take viruses out of mouse tumors and inject them into people and give people cancer.
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  And then they figured out how to put it in stasis and put it in vaccines.
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  And they did the polio vaccine on record.
[15:18.000 --> 15:19.000]  That's declassified.
[15:19.000 --> 15:25.000]  We're not back in the 1920s and they learned how to inject you with with the juice out of tumors and give you cancer.
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.000]  They are way more advanced.
[15:28.000 --> 15:29.000]  We're going to break.
[15:29.000 --> 15:30.000]  Mike Adams is taking over.
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  Please remember without your financial support, we can't keep operations.
[15:33.000 --> 15:39.000]  We're going to sell out of the immune gargle with the patented nano silver at info or short.com.
[15:39.000 --> 15:40.000]  But it's still 40% off.
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  And the storeable food is going to sell out very, very soon as well.
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  Get yours at info or short.com.
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  That funds our operation.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  How long do we have to break here?
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  We're going to break in 10 seconds and Mike Adams is going to take over.
[15:51.000 --> 15:54.000]  But the most important thing is to spread the word about the broadcast.
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  That's what circumvents the sensors.
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  So the truth of this can come out before it's too late.
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.000]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[16:00.000 --> 16:06.000]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system, but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up,
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.000]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[16:09.000 --> 16:10.000]  Bill Hyde here.
[16:10.000 --> 16:15.000]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system.
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.000]  That's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[16:18.000 --> 16:23.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[16:23.000 --> 16:30.000]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[16:30.000 --> 16:36.000]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[16:36.000 --> 16:37.000]  So here's what you should do right now.
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[16:41.000 --> 16:43.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[16:43.000 --> 16:48.000]  Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.
[16:48.000 --> 16:55.000]  In the best part, you're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200. Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[16:55.000 --> 17:21.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[17:21.000 --> 17:47.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[17:47.000 --> 17:59.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[17:59.000 --> 18:08.000]  I spend a lot of time reminding the Info Wars family of listeners and viewers that without you, we won't be on the air.
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[18:10.000 --> 18:18.000]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres.
[18:18.000 --> 18:25.000]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[18:25.000 --> 18:30.000]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration.
[18:30.000 --> 18:34.000]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[18:34.000 --> 18:40.000]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  So it's not a burden to support Info Wars.
[18:44.000 --> 18:55.000]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[18:55.000 --> 19:00.000]  So visit infowarstore.com today.
[19:00.000 --> 19:03.000]  This should really be easier than it is.
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.000]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[19:08.000 --> 19:17.000]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is.
[19:17.000 --> 19:23.000]  And then your support of the product we're selling will help you and will help us.
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.000]  And it's symbiotic.
[19:25.000 --> 19:31.000]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen.
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.000]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen.
[19:34.000 --> 19:43.000]  And I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine.
[19:43.000 --> 19:49.000]  We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  And I'm telling you folks, get it.
[19:51.000 --> 19:52.000]  It's amazing.
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  Discover the benefits.
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  And it funds the Info War, a 360 win.
[19:56.000 --> 20:01.000]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[20:26.000 --> 20:31.000]  This is Alex Jones.
[20:31.000 --> 20:37.000]  And this is Owen Troyer in the Info Wars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[20:37.000 --> 20:51.000]  I will be manning the helm here as I pitch the stage now to Mike Adams to get into the latest with the coronavirus and other news.
[20:51.000 --> 20:54.000]  Mike Adams from naturalnews.com.
[20:54.000 --> 20:55.000]  Take it away.
[20:55.000 --> 21:01.000]  Well, today we have additional confirmation, Owen, that this is of human origin.
[21:01.000 --> 21:05.000]  This coronavirus pandemic was engineered in a laboratory.
[21:05.000 --> 21:16.000]  And now Francis Boyle, of course, who will be joining the show tomorrow confirming that in truly a bombshell interview with an organization named Geopolitics and Empire.
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  It's a bombshell interview.
[21:18.000 --> 21:25.000]  It's been posted now on Brighton.com as well. Geopolitics and Empire had launched a channel there quite some time ago.
[21:25.000 --> 21:30.000]  YouTube will likely ban this interview because we're going to publish a full transcript of it.
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  It's bombshell after bombshell.
[21:32.000 --> 21:42.000]  Francis Boyle talking about the incredible number of bio weapons laboratories in China, in the United States, in Canada, and around the world.
[21:42.000 --> 21:46.000]  How governments of the world are in the, quote, death science industry.
[21:46.000 --> 21:51.000]  And their job is to create organisms that exterminate human life.
[21:51.000 --> 21:52.000]  That is what they're doing.
[21:52.000 --> 21:57.000]  They've been working on it for many years, spending hundreds of billions of dollars on this effort globally.
[21:57.000 --> 22:03.000]  And it looks like this virus escaped from a BSL4 facility in China.
[22:03.000 --> 22:11.000]  And Francis Boyle gives us the full breakdown of that, calling it an offensive biological warfare weapon.
[22:11.000 --> 22:16.000]  He says any hint that this is from bats or from nature is absurd.
[22:16.000 --> 22:21.000]  It doesn't have any of the properties of a normal in the wild virus.
[22:21.000 --> 22:28.000]  A virus in the wild that has a hierarchy, kind of a family tree, a lineage that you can trace back through the mutations.
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  This coronavirus has none of that.
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  It was engineered in the laboratory.
[22:32.000 --> 22:44.000]  And the fact that now the left wing media, the tech giants, and the vaccine industry slash biotech industry are all now running a coordinated lie on this point to cover up the truth.
[22:44.000 --> 22:52.000]  That an engineered, a science manufactured bio weapon now threatens humanity.
[22:52.000 --> 23:00.000]  The fact that they're covering that up shows you the level of complicity and how dangerous censorship really is.
[23:00.000 --> 23:04.000]  And how dangerous the left wing media has become and the censorship of the tech giants.
[23:04.000 --> 23:06.000]  Because think about this, Owen.
[23:06.000 --> 23:12.000]  The fact that they are saying that this is just from nature means, oh, there's probably nothing to worry about.
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  It wasn't engineered to kill people.
[23:14.000 --> 23:15.000]  It wasn't engineered to spread.
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.000]  They're saying, oh, it's just mother nature is bad.
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  Blame mother nature.
[23:20.000 --> 23:25.000]  It's a bunch of bats and a bunch of snakes and a bunch of raccoons that got together in a Chinese seafood market.
[23:25.000 --> 23:26.000]  And they all shared genes.
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  And this is what came out of it.
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.000]  It's mother nature's fault.
[23:30.000 --> 23:31.000]  No.
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.000]  It's humanity.
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.000]  It's mad science.
[23:35.000 --> 23:36.000]  Science gone bad.
[23:36.000 --> 23:42.000]  And in fact, it was on this very show eight years ago in 2012 that I warned about this.
[23:42.000 --> 23:49.000]  The big, a big meme, a big story called stop out of control science SOS.
[23:49.000 --> 23:58.000]  And I specifically named research into bio weapons as a self replicating pollution and risk hazard to humanity.
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  That was eight years ago.
[24:00.000 --> 24:07.000]  And in response, of course, I was banned everywhere, banned on every platform because they can't let the truth come out.
[24:07.000 --> 24:11.000]  In fact, the first casualty in any pandemic is the truth.
[24:11.000 --> 24:12.000]  But this is real.
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.000]  In fact, the story is even bigger than anything I've said so far.
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  Here's the big, big story.
[24:18.000 --> 24:22.000]  And I was texting Alex this last night because it was just mind blowing.
[24:22.000 --> 24:28.000]  Website that's been covering this is called greatgameindia.com, greatgameindia.com.
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  They've done excellent reporting on this.
[24:31.000 --> 24:36.000]  They have a page called coronavirus China's secret plan to weaponize viruses.
[24:36.000 --> 24:54.000]  This is more bombshell information because it was almost two decades ago that the Chinese Defense Minister General Qi Hao Tian said that China cannot coexist with the United States of America and that China is ultimately going to have to destroy America.
[24:54.000 --> 25:11.000]  And the best way, in his view, to achieve that was to develop weaponized viruses, biological weapon systems, and then release them in the United States of America, wipe out the American people, take over the country through military invasion,
[25:11.000 --> 25:21.000]  and then claim America's resources so that China can grow and expand not only on this world, but multiple worlds, the moon, Mars, all the way into the future of the human race.
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  That's China's plan.
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  Listen carefully, folks.
[25:25.000 --> 25:38.000]  This biological weapon was accidentally released from a Chinese virology laboratory, a military-grade weapons laboratory, BSL4 lab, in the Wuhan region.
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.000]  This virus was meant to be released in the United States.
[25:43.000 --> 25:55.000]  What you are seeing in China right now with the quarantines, with people falling dead on the streets, with the hospitals that have bars on the windows of every single room, it's a quarantine prison camp.
[25:55.000 --> 25:58.000]  It's not even a hospital, it's a prison camp.
[25:58.000 --> 26:05.000]  And now I'm hearing from multiple sources rumors that the Chinese government is now executing people who are infected, just shooting them.
[26:05.000 --> 26:13.000]  Shooting them dead, burning their bodies, covering it up, not even diagnosing them so that the numbers don't show in terms of fatalities.
[26:13.000 --> 26:30.000]  All of that that's happening in China right now was intended to happen in Los Angeles, in San Francisco, in Seattle, in Houston, Miami, Chicago, New York, all over the United States of America, because China was working on a weapon to deploy it in the United States.
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  This is what you need to understand.
[26:33.000 --> 26:44.000]  They played God with viruses, and they just burned themselves so badly that the Chinese leadership now knows that its very existence is threatened.
[26:44.000 --> 26:56.000]  That's why they made a triage decision on January 25th to save 11 major cities in China, the military and industrial hubs, by sacrificing if necessary everybody else in China.
[26:56.000 --> 27:01.000]  They will sacrifice if they need to millions of lives in order to save those 11 cities.
[27:01.000 --> 27:10.000]  China knows how dangerous this is because they know it's a biological weapon, while the US media lies to the American people and says there's nothing to worry about.
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  This is just like a common cold.
[27:12.000 --> 27:17.000]  It's a weaponized system that is highly effective at killing people.
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  And Francis Boyle knows this.
[27:19.000 --> 27:30.000]  He talks about the gain of function attributes that were engineered into this virus, for example, allowing it to spread through the air, allowing it to spread through casual contact.
[27:30.000 --> 27:48.000]  Through our reporters out of Taiwan, who are in contact with people in Hong Kong and mainland China, we are getting stunning reports of, for example, workers at a department store who all got infected all on the same day because a customer, a shopper,
[27:48.000 --> 27:56.000]  was walking around different departments that day shopping for cosmetics, shopping for shoes, shopping for clothes, infected all the workers.
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.000]  And that shopper didn't even know they had the virus.
[27:59.000 --> 28:02.000]  They weren't even diagnosed until about 10 days later.
[28:02.000 --> 28:08.000]  This spreads in a stealth mode because it is a weapon system.
[28:08.000 --> 28:19.000]  And any media organization, any scientist, any government official, and especially the lying WHO, that tells you that this was a natural accident, a permutation in the wild.
[28:19.000 --> 28:26.000]  They are a malicious liar, and they don't care how many people die from their disinformation.
[28:26.000 --> 28:30.000]  We here at Infowars, we are telling you the truth.
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  We want you to be prepared.
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  We want you to know this is a weapon system.
[28:34.000 --> 28:39.000]  And if we don't escalate our efforts to stop this, we are all threatened by this.
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  The time to get prepared is now.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  The time to be informed is now.
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  And this is the place to get informed.
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  Infowars.com.
[28:47.000 --> 28:50.000]  We'll be back after this break with more straight ahead.
[28:50.000 --> 28:57.000]  Stay with us.
[29:20.000 --> 29:25.000]  The money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[29:25.000 --> 29:36.000]  Non-security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.

[29:46.000 --> 29:47.000]  Call now.
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  800-600-3388.
[29:49.000 --> 29:59.000]  Equipment offered poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[29:59.000 --> 30:10.000]  It's amazing that we have the only patented nano silver that's been found by Homeland Security to take out SARS, which is the same family as the Corona virus.
[30:10.000 --> 30:13.000]  We have it in our super silver toothpaste.
[30:13.000 --> 30:15.000]  We have it in our super blue toothpaste.
[30:15.000 --> 30:22.000]  We have it in the immune gargle products and of course it's in the super silver wound gel that is sold nationally.
[30:22.000 --> 30:28.000]  We just private label it from the people that produce the nano tech company out of Colorado.
[30:28.000 --> 30:34.000]  And we have a stockpile of it, but we've already sold half of the stockpile of it.
[30:34.000 --> 30:44.000]  And I'm still offering the products at 40 to 50% off and then fullwarstore.com until they sell out, which most of these products are set to sell out within days.
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  Or then about another week.
[30:46.000 --> 30:52.000]  So go to infowarstore.com to get your immune gargle, to get the toothpaste and to get the super silver wound gel.
[30:52.000 --> 30:57.000]  But the immune gargle is what is so important because you gargle with it and can also drink it.
[30:57.000 --> 30:59.000]  infowarstore.com
[30:59.000 --> 31:05.000]  Folks, once you need the food, once you need the water filters, once you need the masks, it'll be too late to get them.
[31:05.000 --> 31:10.000]  You gotta get them now before you find that you require them for survival.
[31:10.000 --> 31:14.000]  Trust us, this is not something to be messing around with.
[31:14.000 --> 31:22.000]  Please go to infowarstore.com, make your purchase today and at least have that part of survival covered.
[31:22.000 --> 31:28.000]  The food, the time it will take for the rest of society to collapse or calm down or whatever the case may be.
[31:28.000 --> 31:32.000]  The RZ error filtration mask, M2 mesh, I have one of those personally.
[31:32.000 --> 31:36.000]  I've got a couple of these things off the old infowarstore.
[31:36.000 --> 31:40.000]  I am prepared. Are you, if you're not, infowarstore.com on sale now.
[31:40.000 --> 31:43.000]  Everything you need to prepare yourself for whatever comes next, folks.
[31:43.000 --> 31:45.000]  It's not necessarily the disease.
[31:45.000 --> 31:47.000]  It's the panic that surrounds the disease.
[31:47.000 --> 31:51.000]  It's the collapse that the disease would bring upon that you need to be prepared for.
[31:51.000 --> 31:54.000]  Food will be off the shelves. The water won't be available.
[31:54.000 --> 31:58.000]  You might not even be able to leave your house. You gotta be prepared before it comes down.
[31:58.000 --> 32:00.000]  Well, it's here, the year 2020.
[32:00.000 --> 32:06.000]  World governments out in the open. We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer.
[32:06.000 --> 32:10.000]  And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place.
[32:10.000 --> 32:20.000]  It's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn.
[32:20.000 --> 32:26.000]  Wow. Yes, now we know we're right. The new world order is real. Satanism is real. The pedophile leader real.
[32:26.000 --> 32:30.000]  But we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying no.
[32:30.000 --> 32:35.000]  But I just want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we have never been in Kansas.
[32:35.000 --> 32:38.000]  We have never been in some small, ill place that didn't matter.
[32:38.000 --> 32:43.000]  Everything we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species.
[32:43.000 --> 32:45.000]  And everything we've gone through and everything we're gonna go through.
[32:45.000 --> 32:47.000]  So it's an incredible time to be alive.
[32:47.000 --> 32:50.000]  I'm gonna thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[32:50.000 --> 32:57.000]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth, and financial support at www.membershore.com is critical.
[32:57.000 --> 33:23.000]  So please take action.
[33:23.000 --> 33:31.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Owens Royer here in the Info Wars World headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[33:31.000 --> 33:39.000]  Mike Adams on the air right now from naturalnews.com, hosting this hour, breaking down the latest from the coronavirus.
[33:39.000 --> 33:45.000]  A lot is coming out of China despite the Chinese government trying to suppress that information from getting out.
[33:45.000 --> 33:47.000]  A lot of videos are getting out as well.
[33:47.000 --> 33:52.000]  We salute the brave individuals in China for helping get this information out.
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.000]  They're literally risking their lives.
[33:54.000 --> 34:04.000]  But Mike Adams, get back into the devastating news that's coming out now with Francis Boyle reporting how this coronavirus strain was designed as a bioweapon.
[34:04.000 --> 34:08.000]  Owen, thanks for being here today. By the way, it's great to see you back.
[34:08.000 --> 34:13.000]  For a while, I thought we were gonna have to send a hazmat team into your apartment to rescue you or something.
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.000]  Yeah, the Chinese government thought about sending a crew over just to keep me under wraps.
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  But no, it's good to be back.
[34:19.000 --> 34:26.000]  You're back. Well, that's what happens when they throw you in a jail cell for exercising your First Amendment right in Washington, D.C.
[34:26.000 --> 34:30.000]  And then they expose you to all the pathogens that are in that facility.
[34:30.000 --> 34:35.000]  These facilities are dirty. That's actually part of the punishment that they put on people.
[34:35.000 --> 34:39.000]  Of course, they're not throwing anybody else in jail for exercising their First Amendment if they're anti-Trumpers.
[34:39.000 --> 34:41.000]  It's just you.
[34:41.000 --> 34:43.000]  Anyway, we're glad to see you back.
[34:43.000 --> 34:50.000]  Now, too, on Rush Limbaugh, you know, yesterday on his show, he announced that he had apparently late-stage lung cancer,
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.000]  if I'm understanding what he said correctly.
[34:53.000 --> 34:56.000]  Rush Limbaugh is an American treasure.
[34:56.000 --> 35:02.000]  He is a great patriot, and he has really become more awakened since the 2016 election.
[35:02.000 --> 35:10.000]  Rush Limbaugh now understands the truth about the deep state and the level of corruption, collusion, and treason happening in America behind the scenes,
[35:10.000 --> 35:14.000]  that maybe he wasn't aware of that so much during the Bush years.
[35:14.000 --> 35:21.000]  But boy, he has really come around, and he has been an amazing voice, an amazing patriot.
[35:21.000 --> 35:31.000]  And I just want to say to Rush Limbaugh today, the conventional cancer industry does not help people overcome cancer.
[35:31.000 --> 35:36.000]  The conventional cancer industry kills people with their chemotherapy and radiation.
[35:36.000 --> 35:48.000]  And if you want to live, then call me, because I can put you in touch with dozens of doctors the best in the world who actually cure even stage 4 cancer
[35:48.000 --> 35:53.000]  using holistic, complementary, and alternative therapies that are documented to work,
[35:53.000 --> 35:57.000]  unlike chemotherapy that's documented to kill cells.
[35:57.000 --> 36:04.000]  There are also things you can do if you want to protect your healthy cells from chemotherapy, even while you're undergoing chemotherapy.
[36:04.000 --> 36:11.000]  There are ways to do that, and it's critical to protect your brain, Rush, because chemo-brain is a real thing.
[36:11.000 --> 36:16.000]  Chemotherapy damages your brain, damages your heart, damages your liver and kidneys.
[36:16.000 --> 36:22.000]  And this is one reason why people who undergo chemotherapy, they have brain fog for the rest of their lives.
[36:22.000 --> 36:30.000]  Rush, we can't have you having brain fog. We need your brain present, aware, alive as usual.
[36:30.000 --> 36:41.000]  So please, Rush Limbaugh, get information about how to save yourself from the toxic cancer industry, and we send you our prayers and our best wishes.
[36:41.000 --> 36:51.000]  On the Iowa caucuses situation, Iowa has proven that Democrats need to learn to code, or at least they could start by learning to count.
[36:51.000 --> 37:01.000]  We published a story on natural news the other day that there's interesting science about honeybees actually being able to count a story about insects being able to compute.
[37:01.000 --> 37:07.000]  And it turns out that insects are smarter than Democrats in Iowa because they can't even count.
[37:07.000 --> 37:14.000]  I mean, imagine that. Imagine elephants can count the number of pieces of fruit using their sense of smell.
[37:14.000 --> 37:20.000]  That's additional research that has just come out, but Democrats in Iowa can't count votes.
[37:20.000 --> 37:28.000]  It's amazing, and they're supposed to run the country. They can't run a caucus. They can't run an app, and they want to run your life.
[37:28.000 --> 37:35.000]  They want to tell you how big of a soda you can drink. They want to tell you what you're allowed to say and think.
[37:35.000 --> 37:42.000]  They want to control your speech. Elizabeth Warren wants to create criminal offenses for people who say things that they find offensive.
[37:42.000 --> 37:48.000]  And she wants to have apparently her entire cabinet run by transgenders, regardless of qualifications.
[37:48.000 --> 37:56.000]  The only qualification in Elizabeth Warren's cabinet or administration is that you have a mental illness of believing you're the opposite sex.
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.000]  Then you can get into her cabinet. No problem.
[37:59.000 --> 38:07.000]  But your qualifications of actually engaging the world in geopolitics, apparently that's irrelevant to Elizabeth Warren.
[38:07.000 --> 38:12.000]  It's going to be the virtue signaling idiocracy administration. No kidding.
[38:12.000 --> 38:18.000]  These people are totally insane, but I just want to say, Democrats, learn to code.
[38:18.000 --> 38:28.000]  If you want to build apps, it's a great starting point to one day learning how to maybe run your own party without rigging the election and stealing all the votes from Bernie Sanders.
[38:28.000 --> 38:36.000]  And yes, Bernie Sanders have every right to be angry right now, because listen, if you're a Bernie Sanders supporter watching this, and I know there are some watching this,
[38:36.000 --> 38:44.000]  the election is being stolen from you again, again. They're rigging it. Of course they're rigging it. That's all they know how to do.
[38:44.000 --> 38:50.000]  Democrats can't win on debates. They can't win on principles. They can't win any honest election.
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.000]  This is why they have to censor and deplatform the voices that they hate.
[38:54.000 --> 39:03.000]  This is why they have to cheat and lie and steal and rig everything with their secret courts and secret trials and secret witnesses and secret whistleblowers,
[39:03.000 --> 39:12.000]  secret apps that don't even work. This is the Democrats, and you are watching the implosion of the Democrat Party in the United States of America.
[39:12.000 --> 39:20.000]  Now, getting to some practical things. I'm going to get back to the coronavirus here, but I want you to know I'm a volunteer here, by the way.
[39:20.000 --> 39:30.000]  I'm not paid. I don't want to be paid, but the reason I say that is because I implore you to take advantage of the supplies that are still available at InfowarsStore.com.
[39:30.000 --> 39:39.000]  The food supplies that they're offering right now will run out in maybe six, seven, eight days. I don't know the exact number, but they're going to be gone.
[39:39.000 --> 39:47.000]  My own store has sold out of all our food last week. It's gone. We don't even have anything else to offer, even if I wanted to plug it, which I'm not.
[39:47.000 --> 39:54.000]  InfowarsStore has got the food supplies. They've got them now. They're shipping now. It's in inventory now, and it's very limited.
[39:54.000 --> 40:07.000]  Why does this matter? Oh, and the immune gargle as well. You know, colloidal silver, a gargle, you need to start looking at ways to protect yourself, because even if you believe that the vaccine establishment is going to have a vaccine that stops this,
[40:07.000 --> 40:20.000]  even if you believe that they can't have a vaccine for at least a year, or unless they want to release it untested, a mass vaccine experiment on the United States citizens.
[40:20.000 --> 40:27.000]  I wouldn't put that past them. Yeah, they could have a vaccine in three or four months if it's an experiment. Are you going to line up for that one?
[40:27.000 --> 40:37.000]  Yeah, here, take a vaccine that might accidentally have Ebola strains in it, or SARS strains, or who knows what. There's no quality control of the vaccine industry. No quality control at all.
[40:37.000 --> 40:46.000]  In fact, the vaccine industry's quality is worse than the quality control of the programmers who wrote the app in the Iowa caucuses. The vaccine industry has absolute legal immunity.
[40:46.000 --> 40:59.000]  You can't sue them for bad quality. You know, if a car manufacturer sells you a car that explodes when you turn it on, well, you know, your family could sue them for your death, but not the vaccine industry.
[40:59.000 --> 41:07.000]  And vaccines maim and kill children and adults all around the world every day, every minute of every day around the world.
[41:07.000 --> 41:22.000]  The U.S. government releases the statistics through the HHS website, V-A-E-R-S, that's veirs.hhs.gov. You can download and excel spreadsheet detailing the number of people harmed and killed by vaccines every year in the United States.
[41:22.000 --> 41:31.000]  It's published by the government. And so all these media organizations that say that's a lie, it's the same cover-up that they're now pushing for the coronavirus.
[41:31.000 --> 41:38.000]  They have to protect the biological weapons industry just like they have to protect the vaccine industry. The truth can never be allowed to come out.
[41:38.000 --> 41:47.000]  And by the way, they are related. It's all the same people. It's the genetic engineering of the viruses and then the vaccines that they use to make money when the viruses are released.
[41:47.000 --> 41:54.000]  It's the same mad scientists. They make the bioweapons that get released and then they make the vaccines and then they claim to be your saviors.
[41:54.000 --> 42:03.000]  They're the ones who caused the problem in the first place. If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have this pandemic. And by the way, this is not the end of it.
[42:03.000 --> 42:15.000]  This is just the beginning because you see, I mentioned this yesterday, the fact that this coronavirus is in the wild, this means that enemies of America are out there harvesting this virus right now.
[42:15.000 --> 42:24.000]  They are taking samples and they are replicating samples in their own labs and they can release it at any time in the United States effortlessly.
[42:24.000 --> 42:31.000]  It's so easy for them to do this. It's called asymmetric warfare and it's easy to harvest and replicate and release that virus.
[42:31.000 --> 42:36.000]  So, Owen, back to you. That's what I've got for this segment. There's more coming up next segment.
[42:36.000 --> 42:45.000]  All right, Mike, we look forward to seeing you again here in four minutes. But remember, folks, during this short break, hop on over to infowarstore.com.

[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[44:41.000 --> 44:45.000]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3. That's why people get so sick.
[44:45.000 --> 44:46.000]  That's the main reason.
[44:46.000 --> 44:49.000]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue, get higher absorption, it's amazing.

[46:55.000 --> 47:17.000]  InfowarsStore.com
[47:17.000 --> 47:28.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:28.000 --> 47:35.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've got Mike Adams with us for another segment here on the Alex Jones show.
[47:35.000 --> 47:39.000]  And then I will be hosting, we may be rejoined by Alex Jones.
[47:39.000 --> 47:45.000]  And then Paul Joseph Watson in the fourth hour, I got a lot of other news that I'm going to get to as well.
[47:45.000 --> 47:53.000]  But Mike, what is your final segment today? What is on the docket?
[47:53.000 --> 48:01.000]  Well, we need to get into the official narrative and the controlling of facts and truth surrounding this.
[48:01.000 --> 48:06.000]  We now know that the WHO is heavily influenced, partially run by China.
[48:06.000 --> 48:11.000]  The WHO is funded by the pharmaceutical industry that stands to profit from this pandemic.
[48:11.000 --> 48:17.000]  The WHO is a globalist organization, anti-America in many ways,
[48:17.000 --> 48:24.000]  that seems to agree with the Bill Gates goal of depopulating the planet, removing as many humans as possible.
[48:24.000 --> 48:29.000]  And today we see the WHO coming out and praising China for its transparency.
[48:29.000 --> 48:37.000]  That's the first one, praising a communist regime that's covering up mass deaths for its transparency.
[48:37.000 --> 48:44.000]  So just stunning. And then claiming that the world is racist, essentially,
[48:44.000 --> 48:50.000]  for blaming China for this biological weapon release, which they say isn't a biological weapon.
[48:50.000 --> 48:55.000]  So apparently if you believe that there is a pandemic at all, you are a racist.
[48:55.000 --> 48:59.000]  This is a whole new level of virtue signaling and propaganda from the WHO.
[48:59.000 --> 49:04.000]  So I thought I would read a World Health Organization mock press release.
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.000]  This is a satire bit. The World Health Organization announces today,
[49:08.000 --> 49:14.000]  there have never been pandemics ever in the history of the world and anyone who says so is a racist.
[49:14.000 --> 49:18.000]  In fact, the World Health Organization now says there are no viruses.
[49:18.000 --> 49:26.000]  Viruses are a right-wing conspiracy theory and do not exist according to the WHO, but transgenderism is real.
[49:26.000 --> 49:33.000]  In addition, there are no labs that are researching biological weapons.
[49:33.000 --> 49:43.000]  The laboratories are here to help humanity prosper into the next generation with the help of speech police
[49:43.000 --> 49:52.000]  run by the tech giants using censorship indexes provided by communist China that should be praised for helping our world.
[49:52.000 --> 49:56.000]  Again, that's a mock press release from the WHO, but this is where we're heading.
[49:56.000 --> 50:01.000]  If you believe there has ever been a pandemic, you're now going to be called a conspiracy theorist.
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  If you believe there has ever been a biological weapon ever in the history of the world,
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  you're going to be called a conspiracy theorist.
[50:07.000 --> 50:13.000]  I mean, never mind the fact that even in that book called The Hot Zone,
[50:13.000 --> 50:17.000]  I think it's by Preston, if I'm not mistaken, Fort Detrick, Maryland,
[50:17.000 --> 50:27.000]  the U.S. Army system of research, the biological weapons research facility was researching Ebola, primate Ebola,
[50:27.000 --> 50:32.000]  and it escaped and it infected one of the researchers and they had to nuke the entire facility there.
[50:32.000 --> 50:36.000]  Nuke meaning like a chemical bomb, a chemical nuke, they had to kill all the monkeys,
[50:36.000 --> 50:39.000]  they had to wipe out everything, they shut it down.
[50:39.000 --> 50:44.000]  That was in Fort Detrick, part of the U.S. Army operation.
[50:44.000 --> 50:47.000]  It's well-known, it's well-documented, but today we're told,
[50:47.000 --> 50:52.000]  oh my gosh, if you believe there's ever been a biological weapon, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[50:52.000 --> 50:57.000]  And it's all being fact-checked now, the fact-checkers are saying, no, such thing as a biological weapon.
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  Never happened, never will, never existed.
[50:59.000 --> 51:06.000]  So you talk about shaping reality or attempting to, I mean, no wonder they're attacking this network so much.
[51:06.000 --> 51:09.000]  No wonder I'm being smeared and Alex Jones is being smeared,
[51:09.000 --> 51:14.000]  and no doubt Francis Boyle will be smeared next because he dared to stand up and tell the truth
[51:14.000 --> 51:21.000]  that this is an offensive biological warfare weapon that escaped a lab in China.
[51:21.000 --> 51:27.000]  I mean, think about that, think about the level of lying, think about the level of subterfuge
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  that's being carried out to cover this up.
[51:29.000 --> 51:34.000]  Now, on the bigger picture, and here's where we get into the analysis that you can only find on Infowars,
[51:34.000 --> 51:40.000]  the World Health Organization supports the global depopulation agenda.
[51:40.000 --> 51:46.000]  This is the Bill and Melinda Gates agenda, and Francis Boyle even talked about that in his interview, by the way.
[51:46.000 --> 51:51.000]  Just again, bombshell after bombshell, you've got to watch that interview with what is it again, geopolitics and empire.
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.000]  Just bombshells.
[51:53.000 --> 51:59.000]  There is an active agenda to remove most of the human race from planet Earth.
[51:59.000 --> 52:02.000]  It's openly talked about by the globalists.
[52:02.000 --> 52:10.000]  And the United States of America, and especially President Trump, with his border security and his nationalism
[52:10.000 --> 52:16.000]  and his desire to make America great again, he stands in the way of the anti-human agenda of the globalists.
[52:16.000 --> 52:23.000]  That anti-human agenda includes biological weapons, infanticide and abortion,
[52:23.000 --> 52:31.000]  open borders, overrunning Europe with radical Islamic terrorists who, after they get arrested, are just released back onto the streets
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  so they can go stab more people, by the way.
[52:33.000 --> 52:41.000]  That's the new law enforcement philosophy in the UK, is just find the worst criminals and then release them back onto the streets
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  so they can commit more violence. It's amazing.
[52:43.000 --> 52:48.000]  Much the same thing is happening in New York now, where there's apparently a catch-and-release program.
[52:48.000 --> 52:51.000]  You can be some crazy criminal.
[52:51.000 --> 52:55.000]  There's not even any bail. You just get released back onto the street.
[52:55.000 --> 52:59.000]  Even if you're dealing meth drugs, you just get released.
[52:59.000 --> 53:04.000]  It's incredible. The lawlessness that's happening here is all part of this globalist agenda.
[53:04.000 --> 53:11.000]  The agenda to destroy humanity, the agenda to cause widespread infertility, to cause mental illness,
[53:11.000 --> 53:16.000]  to destroy the family, to destroy the very concept of a mother and a father.
[53:16.000 --> 53:23.000]  You see, sexual reproduction, which is the sharing of genetic code between a mother and a father,
[53:23.000 --> 53:30.000]  is the continuation and sustainability of the human species, not just humans, of course, many other species out there,
[53:30.000 --> 53:33.000]  also use sexual reproduction.
[53:33.000 --> 53:38.000]  But the world governments and pop culture and Hollywood, the left-wing media,
[53:38.000 --> 53:44.000]  even the science establishment now, is attacking the sustainability of the human species
[53:44.000 --> 53:50.000]  by attacking binary sex, males and females, mothers and fathers.
[53:50.000 --> 53:55.000]  It's completely insane, but it's all part of this agenda to depopulate our planet.
[53:55.000 --> 53:59.000]  This biological weapon that was, I believe, accidentally released in China
[53:59.000 --> 54:04.000]  was intended to be deliberately released at some point,
[54:04.000 --> 54:10.000]  probably when China has more gold, when China's ready to roll out its own gold-backed world currency
[54:10.000 --> 54:16.000]  to destroy the U.S. dollar, maybe when China has more troops working with the Mexican narcos
[54:16.000 --> 54:20.000]  ready on the border to invade a weakened United States.
[54:20.000 --> 54:27.000]  You see, they're waiting to get more enemies of America ready to attack and overthrow this country.
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  And then Trump got elected.
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  Hillary was going to turn over America to the globalist.
[54:31.000 --> 54:35.000]  Trump got elected, so then they had to figure out how do they get rid of Trump?
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  Well, guess what?
[54:37.000 --> 54:42.000]  This accidental release may, in fact, really damage Trump
[54:42.000 --> 54:47.000]  if it has a big economic impact in America, which we hope won't happen.
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  Trump needs to get on top of this, in my opinion.
[54:49.000 --> 54:55.000]  He needs to make sure that we're cutting off foreign nationals from arriving in the United States.
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  I know that's already happened with Chinese citizens,
[54:57.000 --> 55:01.000]  but we're still receiving flights from China of American citizens.
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  They need to be more heavily screened and so on.
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  Look, Trump is at risk of this.
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  America is at risk, and this is exactly what the globalists wanted.
[55:09.000 --> 55:10.000]  They hate America.
[55:10.000 --> 55:11.000]  They hate Trump.
[55:11.000 --> 55:12.000]  They hate human life.
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  They hate babies.
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  They want to kill human babies.
[55:16.000 --> 55:19.000]  You think they don't want to kill you with a biological weapon?
[55:19.000 --> 55:20.000]  Of course they do.
[55:20.000 --> 55:21.000]  That's why they built it.
[55:21.000 --> 55:22.000]  That's why they designed it.
[55:22.000 --> 55:23.000]  It's engineered.
[55:23.000 --> 55:30.000]  It's engineered with pieces and parts from SARS and other pieces from HIV that are embedded into it.
[55:30.000 --> 55:37.000]  The attack mechanism, the cellular assault mechanism of HIV has been found in this coronavirus.
[55:37.000 --> 55:38.000]  It's engineered.
[55:38.000 --> 55:44.000]  It's deliberately made to extinguish human life, and it was about to be deployed as a strategic weapon,
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.000]  a long-term plan from China to destroy the United States.
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  Well, let me say this on the record.
[55:50.000 --> 55:54.000]  The Communist government, you want to play God with viruses?
[55:54.000 --> 55:59.000]  You want to build weapons to extinguish human life and cause incredible pain and suffering?
[55:59.000 --> 56:04.000]  Karma just got you because you dropped this in your own backyard.
[56:04.000 --> 56:10.000]  Now you are dealing with the consequences, China, that you wanted to push on to the United States.
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  That's what's happening right now.
[56:12.000 --> 56:19.000]  You could say America got lucky that we weren't hit with this virus as a weapon,
[56:19.000 --> 56:23.000]  and as of this day, America may be able to contain this.
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  It is possible.
[56:25.000 --> 56:28.000]  It's not a certain thing yet, but it's possible.
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.000]  We may be able to contain this, but China cannot contain it.
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  It's out of control in China.
[56:34.000 --> 56:40.000]  Legitimate estimates are over 100,000 people infected, easily thousands of deaths not being reported,
[56:40.000 --> 56:45.000]  hospitals that are now really quarantined, prison camps being built in rapid succession.
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  That's China today.
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  This is out of control in China.
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  This is likely to continue spreading in Asia.
[56:51.000 --> 56:59.000]  I noticed new infections in Thailand, and more deaths outside of China are being reported according to official numbers.
[56:59.000 --> 57:00.000]  This is spreading.
[57:00.000 --> 57:03.000]  So, Owen, that's sort of where we are right now.
[57:03.000 --> 57:04.000]  I've got to go.
[57:04.000 --> 57:08.000]  I've got to get to my lab, by the way, but thanks for having me on today.
[57:08.000 --> 57:11.000]  All right, Mike Adams from naturalnews.com.
[57:11.000 --> 57:17.000]  Follow him there to stay updated with all the latest news on the coronavirus and more.
[57:17.000 --> 57:18.000]  Mike, thank you.
[57:18.000 --> 57:26.000]  All right, when we come back, I think I will go ahead and just go to the Francis Boyle interview
[57:26.000 --> 57:30.000]  that was so bombshell here at the top of the next hour.
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.000]  We'll go ahead and do that at the top of the next hour.
[57:34.000 --> 57:37.000]  Of course, Dr. Boyle will be joining the Alex Jones show tomorrow,
[57:37.000 --> 57:41.000]  and then I'll get into some of the other developing news, political news,
[57:41.000 --> 57:44.000]  and other such things that are going on right now.
[57:44.000 --> 57:45.000]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[57:45.000 --> 57:48.000]  Don't go anywhere.
[57:48.000 --> 57:51.000]  The demand for food has not let up.
[57:51.000 --> 57:53.000]  We are selling record amounts of it.
[57:53.000 --> 57:58.000]  Everybody else has basically already sold out, or they have a giant wait list.
[57:58.000 --> 58:02.000]  Our suppliers have it in-house in the state of seven to 10 days to deliver,
[58:02.000 --> 58:04.000]  because, again, they have to package it.
[58:04.000 --> 58:06.000]  They're running 24 hours a day.
[58:06.000 --> 58:09.000]  But in a few days, they're telling me it may go to a longer wait
[58:09.000 --> 58:11.000]  if you haven't gotten your order yet.
[58:11.000 --> 58:12.000]  So I wouldn't crash today.
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  We wanted this virus to be peering out.
[58:14.000 --> 58:15.000]  We wanted it to just be hype.
[58:15.000 --> 58:18.000]  It looks like it is really, really bad, and it is man-made.
[58:18.000 --> 58:21.000]  And so that's why we're seeing the huge freakouts.
[58:21.000 --> 58:24.000]  So get your storable food at infowarsestore.com.
[58:24.000 --> 58:25.000]  That helps fund your operation.
[58:25.000 --> 58:26.000]  It's insurance.
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  You can eat a total 360 win.
[58:28.000 --> 58:33.000]  Again, get your food and actually get it delivered at infowarsestore.com.
[58:33.000 --> 58:34.000]  Get your order in.
[58:34.000 --> 58:35.000]  It's locked in.
[58:35.000 --> 58:38.000]  Guaranteed seven to 10 days, infowarsestore.com.
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  And regardless, it funds the operation.
[58:40.000 --> 58:42.000]  We also have the immune gargle at 40% off.
[58:42.000 --> 58:43.000]  We are going to sell out of that.
[58:43.000 --> 58:48.000]  But I'm just keeping it at that sales price, infowarsestore.com.
[58:48.000 --> 58:52.000]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[58:52.000 --> 58:54.000]  Introducing pollen block.
[58:54.000 --> 58:59.000]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[58:59.000 --> 59:03.000]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways,
[59:03.000 --> 59:06.000]  eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[59:06.000 --> 59:11.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[59:11.000 --> 59:15.000]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[59:15.000 --> 59:18.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials.
[59:18.000 --> 59:21.000]  And decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,
[59:21.000 --> 59:26.000]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[59:26.000 --> 59:28.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  It is not an antihistamine.
[59:30.000 --> 59:35.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[59:35.000 --> 59:40.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[59:40.000 --> 59:43.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[59:43.000 --> 59:48.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  Of course, what can Hunter Biden tell us about the President's Congress,
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  who is the conduct with Ukraine?
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  What can Hunter Biden tell us about the President's obstruction of Congress?
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  Nothing, obviously.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  The Member of Parliament gives the signal,
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  and Agent Katarina, here pixelated, crosses the restaurant.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  The politician believes she is a businesswoman based in the United Arab Emirates.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  His bodyguard follows her into a private dining room where she hands him the cash.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  Katarina, a detective from Ukraine's Anti-Corruption Bureau,
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  filmed multiple scenes like this over the course of a nine-month investigation.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  At a certain point, she comes across these two MPs, Polyakov and Rosenblatt.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  For payment and using the money he receives,
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  he promises to influence representatives of various public bodies.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  When he realizes that this woman has got money,
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  he constantly wants to talk about this money.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  It becomes pretty unpleasant to watch.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  And I'm reading the New York Times article.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  Mr. Trump told Bolton to call the President,
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  who had recently won election as President of Ukraine,
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  to ensure Mr. Zelensky would meet with Mr. Giuliani,
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  was planning a trip to Ukraine.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  So the President wanted his lawyer to meet with someone.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  My, I've never heard of such, the crime is this.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  The Obama, Biden, Soros, Schiff, Bolton, Pelosi, Kerry, Romney, Clinton,
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  they all used the billions a year going into Ukraine
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  since the Cold War and after to launder the money back to themselves.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  It's the watering hole.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  Last week, manager Schiff said that the investigations
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  President Trump supposedly asked President Zelensky about
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  on the July 25th call could not have been in the country's interest,
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  because he said they were, quote unquote, discredited entirely.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  The House managers say that the investigations had been debunked.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  They were sham investigations.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  So now we have the question, were they really?
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  Who supposedly did the debunking?
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  Who discredited it?
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  Where and when were any such investigations conducted?
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  When were the results published?
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  And much more is left unanswered.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  Here are just a few of the public sources
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  that flagged questions surrounding this very same issue.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  The United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office,
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent,
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  Hunter Biden's former business associate,
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  and ABC White House reporter.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  Good morning, America. ABC.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  The Washington Post.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  The New York Times.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  Ukrainian law enforcement.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  And the Obama State Department itself.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  Burisma has been owned by an oligarch
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  named Mikola Solchevsky.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  Here's what happened very shortly
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  after Vice President Biden was made U.S. Point Man for Ukraine.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  His son Hunter Biden ends up on the board of Burisma
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  working for and paid by the oligarch Solchevsky.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  In the wake of anti-corruption uprising
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  by the people of Ukraine, Solchevsky flees the country,
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  flees Ukraine.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  George Kent, the very first witness
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  that the Democrats called during their public hearings,
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  testified Solchevsky stood out for his self-dealings
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  even among other oligarchs.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  How much money did Hunter Biden get for being on the board?
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  Well, you start looking at this bank records
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  according to reports between April 2014
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  and October 2015,
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  Burisma paid more than $3.1 million
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  to Devon Archer and Hunter Biden.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  That's over the course of a year and a half.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  And that's the watering hole of these people,
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  and that's why they're so pissed.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  welcome back into the Info Wars World Headquarters
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  in Austin, Texas.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  Owen Shroyer with you for the next two hours.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  When we get back from this short break,
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  we're going to go to some of the highlights
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  from the Dr. Boyle interview
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  when he talks about the bio-weapon
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  that is the coronavirus coming out of China.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  That's on the other side. Don't go anywhere.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  It was about a week and a half ago
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  that my father came rushing into my office in the morning
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  and said, son, you've got to see this.
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  The company that holds the patents on the nano-silver
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  that's in our toothpaste, that's in our immune garden,
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  and that's in some of the other great products
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  like the super silver wound shell
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  that had reports from back in 2007
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  with the Pentagon working with A&M
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  and Homeland Security, with the director of Homeland Security,
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  certifying an unrestricted document,
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  confidential documents, of course, noted as
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  that this had been proven in their secret test
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  to be knocking out SARS.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, regardless,
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  now they authorized us to talk about this.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  I talked about it on the show last week,
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  just hiding in plain view.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  This is a product that we had stockpiled
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  and we're still selling it 40% off or more
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  with the combos so that you can get it in your hands.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  It's something that's good for everyday use, regardless,
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  and it funds the operation.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  So infowarstore.com for your immune gargle
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  and other products that contain this key nano-silver.
[1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  We're about to go to this clip
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:15.000]  from Dr. Francis Boyle, very powerful.
[1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  He'll be joining us tomorrow,
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:20.000]  but before I go to that real quick, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  obviously you're seeing what's happening in China,
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  but also remember what happened in Puerto Rico
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  when the government hid emergency food supplies
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  from their people?
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  Imagine being that sick in a leadership position.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  That's what the left does.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  It's vile. It's disgusting.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  It is the left. It is modern-day liberalism.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  Don't get put in a situation like that.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  Get emergency food supplies.
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  We've got specials happening right now at infowarstore.com.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  The top-rated, top-quality emergency storeable food,
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  good for multiple decades.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  It's available at infowarstore.com.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  You can't rely on the government, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  so rely on yourself and get emergency food
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  from infowarstore.com.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  Okay, we now go to the powerful Dr. Francis Boyle interview.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  Here are some clips before Francis Boyle joins us
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  on the Alex Jones show tomorrow.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  If you just do a very simple Google search
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  on does China have a BSL4 laboratory,
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  Wuhan comes up right away.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  It's at the top of the list.
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  That's all.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  The moment this type of thing happened,
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  I began to do that.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  And so a BSL4 is the most serious type.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  And basically, BSL4 labs,
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  we have many of them here in the United States,
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  are used to develop offensive biological warfare weapons
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  with DNA genetic engineering.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  So it does seem to me that the Wuhan BSL4
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  is the source of the coronavirus, yes.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  And my guess is that they were researching SARS
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  and they weaponized it further
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  by giving it gain of function properties,
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  which means it could be more lethal.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  And indeed, the latest report now is it's a 15% fatality rate
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  which is more than SARS at 83% infection rate.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  So a typical gain of function, it travels in the air.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  So it could reach out maybe six feet or more
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  from someone emitting a sneeze or a cough.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  Likewise, this is a specially designated WHO research lab.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  So the WHO is in on it and they knew full well
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  what was going on there.
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  Yes, it's also been reported that Chinese scientists
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  stole coronavirus materials from the Canadian lab at Winnipeg.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  Winnipeg is Canada's foremost center
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  for research developing, testing biological warfare weapons.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  It's along the lines of Fort Detrick here
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  in the United States of America.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  And yeah, I have three degrees from Harvard.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  Would not surprise me if something was being stolen
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  out of Harvard to turn over to China.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  I read that report.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  I don't know what was in those vials one way or the other.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  But the bottom line is my opinion is
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  and I drafted the U.S. domestic implementing legislation
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  for the Biological Weapons Convention.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  That was approved unanimously by both houses
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  of the United States Congress.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  Signed in law by President Bush senior
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  that it appears the coronavirus that we're dealing with here
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  is an offensive biological warfare weapon
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  that leaked out of that Wuhan BSL4.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  I'm not saying it was done deliberately,
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  but there have been previous reports of problems with that lab
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  and things leaking out of it.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  And I'm afraid that is what we are dealing with today.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  All these BSL4 labs are by, you know,
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  United States, Europe, Russia, China, Israel
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  are all there to research, develop, test biological warfare agents.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  There's really no legitimate scientific reason
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  to have BSL4 labs.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  So it's clearly all weapons related.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  We have well over 13,000 alleged life science scientists
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  involved in research, developed testing biological weapons
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  here in the United States.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  So basically this is an offensive biological weapons
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  race by the United States government.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  And it's been with its assistance in Canada and Britain.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  And so other states, the world have responded accordingly,
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  including Russia and China.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  They were going to set up a whole series of BSL4 facilities
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  as well.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  And Wuhan was the first.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  It backfired on them.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  I'm not saying they, you know, deliberately inflicted this
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  on their own people, but it leaked out of there.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  And all these BSL4 facilities leak.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  I mean, everyone knows that and studies this.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  So this was a catastrophe waiting to happen.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  And unfortunately it happened.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  And the Chinese government under Xi and his comrades there
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  have been covering this up from the get-go.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  The first reported case was December 1.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  So they've been sitting on this until they couldn't anymore.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  And everything they're telling you is a lie.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  It's propaganda.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  The WHO is in on it.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  They've approved many of these BSL4 labs.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  They know exactly what's going on.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  And that is a WHO research to prove laboratory.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  So they know what's going on too.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  So you can't really believe anything the WHO is telling
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  you about this.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  Either they're up to their eyeballs in it.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  It might be when you have an outbreak,
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  you're never quite sure who or what is behind it.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  It certainly isn't bats.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  They made the same argument on Ebola in West Africa.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  I demolished that online.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  You can check it out.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  So I kept competing theories about this.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  But right now, you know, when you originally contacted me,
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  I said I wasn't prepared to comment because I was weighing
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  the evidence.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  I'm a law professor, a lawyer.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  I try to do the best I can to weigh the evidence.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  But right now that Wuhan BSL4, in my opinion,
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  is the most likely source, applying Occam's razor,
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  the simplest explanation.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  I'm not ruling out, you know, some type of sabotage.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  But right now, I believe that is the source here.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  And we know that Wuhan BSL4 was research developing,
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  testing SARS as a biological warfare agent.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  So it could have been they gave it this DNA genetic engineering
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  enhanced properties gain of function,
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  which we do here in the West, in the United States,
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  all the time.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  We have all sorts of research that is clearly
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  a bio warfare research that has been approved
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  by the National Institutes of Health.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  It's a joke.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  They know full well they are approving
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  offensive biological warfare research.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  And it gets funded by the United States government.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  Yeah.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  BSL3 and BSL4 labs are only designed for research,
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  development, testing of offensive biological warfare agents.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  In my opinion, they serve no legitimate purpose at all.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  They should all be shut down, every one of them.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  Well, you just can't believe anything the Chinese government,
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  the WHO, the CDC are telling you.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  They're all lying because they know what's going on here.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  And so you're going to have to figure it out as best as you can.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  But in my opinion, as of this time,
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  and I'm fully prepared to consider further evidence on this,
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  it does seem to me that this was a DNA genetically engineered
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  biological warfare agent leaking out a Wuhan that has
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  gain of function properties, which can make it more lethal.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  I think they're probably doing something with SARS
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  to make it more lethal and more infectious.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  And so for that reason, you have to take extreme precautions.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  And they're now finally admitted.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  Well, yeah, anyone within six feet can be infected.
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  Whereas with SARS, it was about two feet.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  Well, that's gaining a function right there.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  That should be a tip off.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  So I guess you're going to have to protect yourself.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  The money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  dozens of critical digital assets.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  Not a security IPO or note.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  deposited into your bank account each month.
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  Don't miss this one.
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  Take your claim today.
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  Call 800-600-3388.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  That's 800-600-3388.
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:44.000]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  Call now 800-600-3388.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  800-600-3388.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  who consult with financial professionals
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  which requires an offering document.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  I'm here with Scott Yousiam, founder of OMG Tax.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  who have a problem with the IRS.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  My team of lawyers enrolled agents and licensed tax experts
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  remove wage garages sometimes in the same day.
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  were required to pay for what is known as an offer in compromise.
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  Oh, can I ever?
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  Guess what?
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  known as non-collectible status with the government.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less,
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  call OMG Tax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  Call 800-486-8112-800-486-8112.
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  800-486-8112, that's 800-486-8112.
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  We now know that more than 60 million people
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  are on total lockdown in China
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  and the food supplies and medical supplies are running out.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  We know the virus has already spread to more than a dozen countries
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  and many Chinese who escaped Wuhan are now confirmed to be arriving
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  on the United States West Coast.
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  We've now confirmed from major food suppliers across the United States
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  that they've already run out of supplies of affordable foods
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  because of institutional and governmental buyers.
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  That's right, the rich, the powerful, the elite,
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  big corporations are now buying up food stores at alarming rates.
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  In full wars, private labels from my patriot supply
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  and ships right out of the very same factory.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  They called and let us know that they have bought food forward,
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  that that's going to run out probably in a few weeks
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  and that people need to order now.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  They want to be able to get it within seven to ten days.
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  But if people wait, it may end up being longer.
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  But if you get your order in now at infowarstore.com
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  you will be secured to get the food within seven to ten days.
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  We're real, Satanism's real, the pedophile, the leader real,
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  but we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying no.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  But I just want to make the point here one month into 2020
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  that we have never been in Kansas.
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  We have never been in some smallville place that didn't matter.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  Everything we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  and everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  So it's an incredible time to be alive.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  I want to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  and financial support at infowarstore.com is critical.
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  So please take action.
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  Live from the infowarstore.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the great Rush Limbaugh, a legendary man, a trailblazer
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  for media, a major influence for me growing up listening to him
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  on one of his major flagship stations in St. Louis, Missouri, KMOX.
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  Of course, he is from that area, made a sad announcement yesterday
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  that he has advanced lung cancer.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  He'll be in my prayers every night.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  Of course, he's all fair today dealing with some treatment.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  Here is that sad announcement from Rush Limbaugh yesterday.
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  This day has been one of the most difficult days in recent memory for me
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  because I've known this moment was coming in the program today.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  Now, I'm sure that you all know by now I really don't like talking about myself
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  and I don't like making things about me other than in the usual satirical,
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  parodic, joking way.
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  I like this program to be about you and the things that matter to all of us.
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  The one thing that I know that has happened over the 31-plus years of this program
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  is that there has been an incredible bond that has developed between all of you and me.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  Now, this program is 31 years old and in that 31, there are people,
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  you hear them call all the time and they've been listening the whole time.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  They've been listening 30 years or 25 years, just had somebody say they've been here three years.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  But whatever, it is a family-type relationship to me.
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  And I've mentioned to you that this program and this job is what has provided me
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  the greatest satisfaction and happiness that I've ever experienced,
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  more than I ever thought that I would experience.
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  So I have to tell you something today that I wish I didn't have to tell you.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  And it's a struggle for me because I had to inform my staff earlier today.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  I can't escape even though people are telling me it's not the way to look at it.
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  I can't help but feel that I'm letting everybody down with this.
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  But the upshot is that I have been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  Diagnosis confirmed by two medical institutions back on January 20th.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  I first realized something was wrong on my birthday week in January 12th.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  And I wish I didn't have to tell you this.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  And I thought about not telling anybody.
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  I thought about trying to do this without anybody knowing,
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  because I don't like making things about me.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  But there are going to be days that I'm not going to be able to be here
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  because I'm undergoing treatment or I'm reacting to treatment.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  And I know that that would inspire all kinds of curiosity with people wondering what's going on.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  And the worst thing that can happen is when there is something going on
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  and you try to hide it and cover it up, it's eventually going to leak.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  And then people are going, why didn't you just say it?
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  Why did you try to fool everybody?
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  And it's not that I want to fool anybody.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  It's just that I don't want to burden anybody with it and I haven't wanted to.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  But it is what it is.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  And you know me, I'm the mayor of Realville.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  So this has happened and my intention is to come here every day I can
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  and to do this program as normally and as competently and as expertly as I do each and every day,
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  because that is the source of my greatest satisfaction professionally, personally.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  I've had so much support from family and friends during this that it's been tremendous.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  And I told the staff today that I have a deeply personal relationship with God that I do not proselytize about.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  But I do and I have been working that relationship tremendously, which I do regularly anyway,
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  but I've been focused on it intensely for the past couple of weeks.
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  I know there are many of you in this audience who have experienced this, who are going through it yourselves at the same time.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  I am at the moment experiencing zero symptoms other than, look, I don't want to get too detailed in this.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  What led to the shortness of breath that I thought might have been asthma or, you know, I'm 69.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  I could have in my heart, my heart's in great shape, ticking away fine, squeezing and pumping great.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  It was not that it was a pulmonary problem involving malignancy.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  So I'm going to be gone the next couple of days as we figure out the treatment course of action and have further testing done.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  But as I said, I'm going to be here as often as I can.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  And as is the case with everybody who finds themselves in a circumstance, you just want to push ahead and try to keep everything as normal as you can,
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  which is something that I'm going to try to do.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  But felt that I had to tell you because that's the kind of relationship I feel like I have with those of you in this audience.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  I say it every Christmas, which is when I feel more thankful than at Thanksgiving.
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  And I feel thankful at Thanksgiving, but Christmas, it really gets to me.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  But over the years, a lot of people have been very nice telling me how much this program is meant to them.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  But whatever that is, it pales in comparison to what you all have meant to me.
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  And I can't describe this, but I know you're there every day.
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  I can see you. It's strange how I am, but I know you're there.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  I know you're there in great numbers.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  And I know that you understand everything I say.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  The rest of the world may not when they hear it expressed a different way, but I know that you do.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  You've been one of the greatest sources of confidence that I've had in my life.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  So I hope I will be talking about this as little as necessary in the coming days.
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  But we've got a great bunch of doctors, a great team assembled.
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  We're at full speed ahead on this.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  And it's just now a matter of implementing what we are going to be told later this week.
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  So I'll be back here. I hope you back on Thursday.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  If not, it'll be as soon as I can.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  And know that every day I'm not here, I'll be thinking about you and missing you.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  The great Rush Limbaugh signs off yesterday.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  May he be on air for another 30 years,
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  bracing the airwaves, the Rush to Excellence tour,
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  Rush Revere, a legendary career, Rush Limbaugh.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out-left sanctuary state until one day I chose to lead my family to freedom.
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana,
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  our BlackRifle Real Estate team is here to help.
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  Go to BlackRifleRealEstate.com. That's BlackRifleRealEstate.com
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:55.000]  The demand for food has not let up. We are selling record amounts of it.
[1:29:55.000 --> 1:30:00.000]  Everybody else is basically already sold out, or they have a giant wait list.
[1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  Our suppliers have it in-house, mistaken 7 to 10 days to deliver,
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  because, again, they have to package it. They're running 24 hours a day.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:13.000]  But in a few days, they're telling me it may go to a longer wait if you haven't gotten your order in.
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:20.000]  So I wouldn't procrastinate. We wanted this virus to be peering out.
[1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  We wanted it to just be hype. Looks like it is really, really bad, and it is man-made.
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:27.000]  And so that's why we're seeing the huge freakouts.
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:30.000]  So get your storable food at infowarsonstore.com.
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  That helps funder operation. It's insurance. You can eat a total 360 win.

[1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:53.000]  We also have the immune guard with 40% off. We are going to sell out of that,

[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:39.000]  Super high quality. Winter sun. You don't have sun during the winter.
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:43.000]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3. That's why people get so sick.
[1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:46.000]  That's the main reason. Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue.
[1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  Get higher absorption. It's amazing. All three of these are on sale,
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:53.000]  but only for a limited time at infowarsstore.com.

[1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road.
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:30.000]  And the only way we can effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game
[1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  on infowars is to tip the spear. If you're finding support,
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  we make it really easy at infowarsstore.com.
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  But I am blowing through our backup money right now
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  with our reporters doing triple the work they ever have,
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  because they volunteered to do it. And Owen and the rest of the crew will fight
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  18 hours a day, 7 days a week during a selection year that's so critical
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:53.000]  but they need the financing to put them in the field.
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:33:20.000]  Go to infowarsstore.com and fight for your own future.
[1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil,
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Owen Troyer here sitting in for Alex.
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  A reminder, tomorrow, Dr. Francis Boyle is going to be on the transmission
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  with Alex Jones.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  The story is at infowars.com.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  Creator of U.S. Bioweapons Act says coronavirus is biological warfare weapon.
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  And you're not going to find a more hard hitting exclusive interview
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  when it comes to the coronavirus and the details that are emerging
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  than that tomorrow.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  And so be sure to tune in and check that out here on the Alex Jones show
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  at infowars.com and band.video.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  There is a lot of stuff coming out.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  There is obviously the Chinese government doing everything they can
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  to suppress information from getting out as communist governments
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  always go for full control over the narrative.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  Now, the one thing you can do is build up a healthy immune system
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  so that should you get a virus, your body is ready to fight it.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  And in case you don't know, I was out sick for an entire week last week.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  The sickest I've been in 12 years.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  In fact, I don't even think I could tell you the last time I missed work due to an illness.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  So I had something pretty serious last week.
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  Pretty much all the symptoms you could imagine knocked me out.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  I was bedridden for five days.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  But I had faith in my immune system that I had built up for a decade
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  taking supplements, many of which are available at infowarstore.com.
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  And so I never went to a doctor.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  I never went to a hospital and dealt with any of that.
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  If my body could beat it, I just had to stick with the battle.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  And here I am today, I'd say about 95%.
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  I'll be 100 tomorrow.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  And one of the number one things you can do to help build up your immune system
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  is colloidal silver.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  Now, this is very well known.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  And we've been so innovative in finding different ways to use our colloidal silver
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  in toothpaste, in an immune gargle formula, in just a colloidal silver bottle.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  It's all at infowarstore.com.
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  And I was handed this very cool series of documentation here
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  from the Department of the Army, from other certified doctors,
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  homeland security, university science and health centers that are all right here.
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  And I was actually unaware of this.
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  But basically it just shows how pure, certified and effective our silver is at infowarstore.com.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  And again, we've found different ways to infuse this in other products
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  to make other products like toothpaste even more effective and powerful
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  than the average toothpaste on the market.
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  Of course, we have the super silver wound dressing gel.
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  Boom.
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  Only available at infowarstore.com.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  This is, honestly, I don't even think I can lay out the proper effectiveness
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  and power and uniqueness of this formula.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  It's only available at infowarstore.com.
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  I mean, this is medical grade beyond stuff right here.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  Super silver wound dressing gel.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  Again, the super silver toothpaste has the silver in it.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  You have the immune gargle that's on sale at infowarstore.com.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  But let me just go back.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  If you don't have super silver wound dressing gel in your first aid kit at home, you're crazy.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  Now, there's obviously other topical wound care gels and applicants out there.
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  They're known to be effective.
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  They're good stuff.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  This is the best.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  This is the top of the line.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  This is the elite right here.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  Super silver wound dressing gel.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  Make no mistake about it.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  And you can use this for anything.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  The one that I found it to be the most effective with is I tend to get blisters sometimes on my feet.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  At least the parts of my feet that aren't totally callous over yet.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  Just from all the exercise and running I do.
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  Now, you know when you get a bad blister it can last for up to a week and it makes it tough to put that shoe back on and get active again.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  With the super silver wound dressing gel within a day or two tops.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  I'm back to being able to put the basketball shoe back on and running full speed.
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  Of course, the immune gargle is on sale right now.
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  40% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  The super silver wound gel I just mentioned.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  40% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  The super silver toothpaste.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  Just amazing.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  My favorite toothpaste.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  My favorite toothpaste was the super blue.
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  Also available at infowarstore.com.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  You take your pick which one is your favorite.
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  But the super silver toothpaste 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  Folks, I'm telling you.
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  Look, I had people telling me why aren't you going to a doctor?
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  You're sick.
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  You have multiple days fever over a hundred.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  You can't even get out of bed.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  You're weak.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  You're pathetic.
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  Why don't you go to a hospital, Shroyer?
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  What are you, nuts?
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  I said no.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  I trust my immune system.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  I don't want to deal with a doctor.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  I don't want to deal with a hospital or an emergency center
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  with all the other germs and everything we know
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  that are floating around.
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  Kind of did my own self-quarantine for a week.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  And I just knew I could beat it.
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  I knew that I'd built up the immune system
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  and I knew I could beat it.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  And I ended up being right.
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  And so while it was a struggle for the week, let me tell you,
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  having that faith in my immune system,
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  knowing that I could beat it,
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  knowing that the products at InfowarsStore.com
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  that I take religiously would help build that immune system
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  and help me recover,
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  it gave me the faith and the strength I needed
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  to be here this week,
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  whereas a weaker individual probably would have lived
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  in a doctor's office for the entire week.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  So again, folks, check out the great products
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  Build up your immune system with all the different colloidal
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  silver products like immune gargle at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  Okay.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  Now, when I come back,
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  I'm going to give you all the news coming out of Iowa.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  So you have an idea of that total catastrophe clown show
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  that is going on there.
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  But let's kind of get ready for that segment
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  with this clip from MSNBC.
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you think you've heard the craziest thing
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  on television?
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  You haven't.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  This is a clip.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  Now, I don't know this individual's name,
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  this from MSNBC, this host or whatever.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  Zerlina Maxwell, did you say?
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  Zerlina Maxwell said perhaps the stupidest thing
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  in the history of television last night.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  Check it out.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  The Iowa caucus is essentially the perfect example
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:29.000]  of systemic racism.
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  91% of the voters in Iowa are white.
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  The reason why you see a drop in turnout,
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  I'm just speculating here, it could be perhaps
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  that white children are not in the cages.
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  So when you're talking about the tangible pain
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  that black and brown people are feeling,
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  they feel a sense of urgency because their kids
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  are being put in cages.
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  I really can't even, I can't even figure or measure
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  or imagine the mental gymnastics that that lunatic
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  had to go through to make that analysis.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  Wow.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  Because most people in Iowa are white
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  and because there was a disastrous caucus,
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  which is all because of the Democrat Party,
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  somehow she finds a way to tie that into kids in cages.
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  What about the kids in cages that they did at the Super Bowl?
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  By the way, you know what, I'll get into some Super Bowl stuff,
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  but again, I mean, folks, do you understand
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  the average liberal commentator has gone completely insane?
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  Okay?
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  Yeah, so because of the kids in cages
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  suffering of brown people and racism and climate change,
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  the Iowa caucus was a disaster last night.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  No, I'll tell you why the Iowa caucus was a disaster last night
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  on the other side of this break.
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:43:57.000]  There's a new way to show your support

[1:44:57.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  Alex Jones here reporting from the road
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:05.000]  on the incredibly dangerous developments concerning the coronavirus.
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  It has now infected hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people.
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  It has now spread across the entire planet.
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  And of course, we've now discovered that indeed it is man-made
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  and engineered, we're covering it live all with our team
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:21.000]  at infowars.com for its last show and band-aid video.
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  On top of that, we have the patented nano silver
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  that Congress A&M and Homeland Security have certified
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  is able to take out the corona family virus as the SARS.
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  That's what it comes out of.
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  We have that at 40% off despite the fact it's selling out
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  in three different sizes at infowarsstore.com
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  and that's what I'm using,
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  what my family's using as a frontline defense.
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  It's perfect except, you know, prayer in God's intervention
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  and we hope that this thing isn't as bad as it looks
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:54.000]  but definitely we know why governments are panicking right now
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  because this is certainly a bizarre virus.
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:00.000]  It is I, the leader of COBRA here
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  for a message to President Trump, the American people
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  and Alex Jones of infowars.
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:11.000]  Our operations with our partners for communist Chinese
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:14.000]  have bought control of your media.
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  It's true, your people are beginning to awaken.
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  That's why COBRA is launching operations to trigger race war,
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  mass shootings and bombings
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:30.000]  which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  Anyone once we stage these attacks
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:35.000]  that does not blame it on Trump
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:39.000]  will also be targeted by COBRA in the future.
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:44.000]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  I will carry out attacks and then blame you
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  like we've done with Alex Jones
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  blaming him for mass shootings we committed.
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  Ha ha, Hey, Oh, COBRA, You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:18.000]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, the Democrats can't even run a caucus
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:21.000]  but they want to run the health care and the education system
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  and pretty much the whole world, so.
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  Yeah, we should trust him with that. I'm sure that won't be a complete disaster of a nightmare.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  I want to, uh...
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  Well...
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  Actually, let me just say this.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  I seem to have developed
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  some sort of strange
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  vision problem where
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  I literally cannot see Democrat candidates
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  without seeing a red nose on their face, clown makeup, and a clown wig.
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  I'm calling it clown vision.
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  So I've somehow developed clown vision,
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  and I cannot even look at a Democrat candidate without seeing a clown face on them.
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  It's very odd that I'm enduring this.
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  But a couple of highlights before I get into this news.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  There were polls that were being run
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  where Democrats were asked,
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  would you rather vote for a candidate you agree with
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  or a candidate that would beat Trump?
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  And 30% voted a candidate they agree with.
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  Over 60% voted a candidate who could beat Trump.
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  Now, think about that.
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  That means a Democrat would literally vote for Satan.
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  If they thought it would beat Trump.
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  That's how far gone these people are.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  Would you rather have a candidate that you agree with
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  or a candidate that could beat Trump?
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  Well, the candidate that could beat Trump is Satan.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  Well, they'll vote Satan.
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  I mean, if that poll isn't indicative
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  of where the average Democrat voter is at right now,
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  nothing else is.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  And I've said it once, I'll say it a thousand times more.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  The one trait that actually unites the Democrat Party is hate.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  Hate for Donald Trump.
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  Hate for whatever identity they're mad at that day.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  Hate for conservatives.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  Hate for America.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  It is the one single identifiable trait
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  that unites the Democrat Party, and it's hate.
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  Now, Sanders is obviously getting robbed
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  by the Democrat Party here, round two.
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  And it's the one single identifiable trait
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  that unites the Democrat Party here, round two.
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  And at the end of the day, he won't care.
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  He'll lay back down.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  He doesn't actually want to be present.
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  This is a lazy bum.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  But one significant number that nobody seems to be talking about,
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  even though it does appear that Sanders did win the caucus
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  and is surging in the polls.
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  Sanders' support from 2016 in the Iowa caucus is actually down.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  Sanders had more support in the 2016 Iowa caucus
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  than he did this year.
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  Now, what does that tell you?
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  It tells you that Sanders is nowhere near as popular
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  as he was in 2016, and the reasons are obvious.
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  He threw his supporters under the bus.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  He laid down to Hillary Clinton, and he didn't say,
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  Jack, about the election theft from himself.
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  Again, Bernie Sanders is a communist bum.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  He doesn't want to be the president.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  He's not going to fight this.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  And even though he's by far the most popular on that side of the aisle,
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  and should he want that nomination, he could get it,
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  and he could fight for it, but he's not going to.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  He never has, and I don't think he ever will.
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  So they're screwing Bernie Sanders over again,
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  and we'll see if his supporters stick with him,
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  even though he refuses to fight back against the election theft
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  that is happening right now inside the Democrat Party.
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  But just remember this.
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  Everything the Democrats do is measured and contrived.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  So this whole delayed result of the caucus is by design
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  and has a agenda behind it.
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  Now, let me see if I can kind of give you a better idea here
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  with some of these headlines.
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  Buttigieg races to push narrative that he won Iowa
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  despite no official results.
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  Well, I think the reason for that is the fix was in for Buttigieg.
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  He was working with Mark Zuckerberg
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  and former Hillary Clinton associates on,
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  well, he wasn't directly working on it.
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  They were working with him.
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  They were working towards building his campaign,
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  a app called Shadow.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  But we'll get to that in a second.
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  Biden campaign blasts Democrat Party over reporting meltdown.
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  Well, you see Biden was supposed to be the clear front runner.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  Biden's the Obama vice president,
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  and Biden is actually now the number five,
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  maybe four top choice for the Democrat nominee right now.
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  It's a total embarrassment, not only for the Obama administration,
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  but for Biden and the Democrat Party as well.
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  They just have no idea.
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  They're lost in a world that doesn't exist, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  Iowa caucus delays, revive concerns and conspiracy theories
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  among Bernie Sanders supporters.
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  Well, the irony here is a little taste of socialism
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  for the Bernie Sanders supporters.
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:47.000]  Well, you see, because Bernie had too much,
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  Bernie had too much support, and it wasn't fair.
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  So we had to give Buddha judge some of that support.
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  We had to give Klobacher some of that support.
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  We had to give Warren and Biden some of that support.
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  You can't have all the support on Bernie Sanders side.
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  So a little taste of socialism for the Bernie supporters
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  who have to give, let me literally like fake polls,
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  they're just going to siphon numbers off to other candidates
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  who aren't Bernie Sanders.
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  Nate Silver, that one of the worst political odds makers,
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  but somehow a top political odds maker headline.
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  Iowa might have screwed up the whole nomination process.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  Boy, you don't say.
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:32.000]  Of course, it doesn't matter.
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  I think that they are going for a brokered convention, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  And so it really all just comes down to July anyway.
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  In what is it Milwaukee where they're having their convention?
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  And I think they're going to give it to Hillary and I can't wait for that to happen.
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  If the Democrat Party isn't dead already,
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  that will be the that will be shoveling the dirt on the coffin of the Democrat Party.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  Did you see the CNN clip?
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  I don't think I have it, but there was a CNN correspondent on the phone with the DNC
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  waiting to get the results of the caucus.
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  They had him on hold for hours.
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  CNN goes to him live.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  He's all befuddled and confused on air.
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  Then the DNC finally picks up and says, OK, we have the results and they hung up on him.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  Again, folks, I can't imagine what it takes to be a Democrat voter right now.
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  It's like, you know, hold your nose in the swallow.
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  Iowa officially has its first caucus deciding coin flip.
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  Wow.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  And not only did they have a coin flip, it was a rigged coin flip.
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  The guy flips the coin, looks at it, puts it over and then realizes,
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  oh, that's not what I wanted and puts it over again and then declares Buddha judge the winner.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  So they're they're they're literally rigging it for Buddha judge.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  And then it turns out some of the people that were there in Iowa as a part of this,
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  who were Buddha judge supporters, they didn't know he was gay.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  And they found out he was married to a man and they literally wanted to withdraw their vote right then and there.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  Boy, that's got to be tough having homophobes in the Democrat voter base.
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  Oh, that's brutal.
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  So here is when we get to the shadow app, which is these techies who used to work for Hillary Clinton,
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  who are now building this app working with Zuckerberg to try to get Buddha judge over the top.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  Tech firm started by Clinton campaign veterans is linked to Iowa caucus reporting debacle.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  It's a rig job, folks. Everything the Democrats do is a rig job.
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  Shady firm shadow behind reportedly reportedly behind Iowa caucus chaos,
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  a shady firm named shadow, which was paid by both the Iowa Democrat Party and Pete Buddha judge campaign,
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  reportedly developed an app said to be responsible for the laid results in the Iowa caucus.
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  But it's not just Iowa.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  Other states were planning on using this as well.
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  And this is just what the Democrats do.
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  This is another just form of Democrat controlled Democrat totalitarianism.
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  Nothing is organic.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  It's all contrived.
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  It all comes from the top.
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  Your vote doesn't count in the Democrat Party.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  I hate to say so.
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  Problematic app used in Iowa caucus is also set to be used in Nevada.
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  And don't worry, folks, as soon as the sweep.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  But here's how it goes.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  They want to control everything.
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  So as soon as the Democrats found out they could start rigging results with this app,
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  they all want it on board.
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  But then you just have some of the stuff you're enduring.
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  If you're a Democrat voter to watch Joe Biden.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  I mean, you know,
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  it's like you don't want to say he made out with his granddaughter on a campaign stage,
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  but well, pretty close.
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  It was a tongue away from a French kiss, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  He's also snapping at news reporters.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  Savannah Guthrie is the latest.
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  And then you've had obviously the Bernie Sanders campaign exposed 2020.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  The violent communist working for Sanders.
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  A handful of them who want riots and violence in the streets.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  Well, now the Elizabeth Warren campaign has been exposed by Project Veritas.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  No one gives a F about a pronoun.
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  Warren staffer blast campaign for pandering to gender issues.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  But Joe Biden said gender issues and transgender issues are the number one concern of our lifetime.
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  Good luck with that, Joe.
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:47.000]  I guess that's why you're falling in the polls.
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  This should really be easier than it is.
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:55.000]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[1:57:55.000 --> 1:58:02.000]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself,
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  you will see how amazing it is.
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  And then your support of the product we're selling will help you and will help us.
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  And it's symbiotic.
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen.
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen.
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  And I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:43.000]  And I'm telling you, folks, get it, it's amazing, discover the benefits, and it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:47.000]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[1:58:47.000 --> 1:58:52.000]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate info wars,
[1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the new order's plans
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:08.000]  to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:19.000]  The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves.
[1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  Because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  They fear the fact that we are awake. They fear the fact that we are alive.
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:57.000]  They fear the fact that we love God and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[2:00:09.000 --> 2:00:17.000]  All right, Project Veritas. I mean, I can't say enough about Project Veritas and James O'Keefe.
[2:00:17.000 --> 2:00:24.000]  A true hero in my eyes. It's always an honor when I get to shake his hand in person.
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  It's kind of funny, every time I see him, I'm like, oh my gosh, James, I love you so much.
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  He's like, okay, calm down, Owen. We've met like ten times. It's not that big of a deal.
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  I'm like, no, it is James. You keep doing amazing stuff.
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  So Exposed 2020 from Project Veritas keeps trucking along. I wonder if they're going to hit every campaign.
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  I wouldn't be surprised, but they've already exposed the Sanders campaign, the violent communists inside of that who want to put you in a gulag,
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  which is sad because there are good people that support Bernie Sanders and support his cause.
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:01:01.000]  And it's just too bad that he really doesn't care about them because he just lets the Democrats steal the elections from him.
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  And it's sad that he doesn't put those good people into campaign managerial positions.
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:11.000]  Instead of these nutcases that end up in those positions, it really makes you wonder.
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  I think Bernie is more hands off with that.
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  But here is the latest from Project Veritas, Exposed 2020 Part 5, Elizabeth Warren's campaign.
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  No one gives a F about your pronouns.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:33.000]  Elizabeth Warren also made another promise about how she will govern if elected.
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  We have to stop putting trans women who are incarcerated into prisons with men.
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  That's like when you come from where I come from.
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  No one gives a F about a guy being thrown out here.
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  I want to know how you're going to create a job.
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  No brainer or I'm going to goddamn lose an election.
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren is fighting hard to stay relevant.
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  Polls show Warren way behind leader Bernie Sanders.
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:01.000]  It seems she is pulling out all the stops in an effort to please voters.
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:07.000]  But our investigation has shown that people on her staff believe her pandering is all wrong.
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  But it's like a different approach as pronouns over making sure people have a decent standard of living that's wrong.
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:19.000]  And it's like when you come from where I come from, no one gives a F about a guy being thrown out here.
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  I want to know how you're going to create a job.
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  I'm here for the pronoun things, but I just feel like I shouldn't have to say he didn't know.
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:27.000]  It's like shouldn't it just be implied?
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  I tell you otherwise.
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:31.000]  If I tell you otherwise, then yeah, but I mean...
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  I've been called out for saying something like that, but it's like this is why we lose elections.
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  Because we're zeroing in a F like that.
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  Recently, Warren promised, if elected, half of her cabinet would be women and or non-binary people.
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  Some on her staff like that kind of talk.
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  Non-binary people!
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  All the staff, the queer staff, the trans staff, that's what it's like.
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  Straight white dudes just...
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:03.000]  You remember?
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  I'm glad that it's all the same.
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  I'm not willing to see you.
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  But some on her staff think pronoun politics doesn't play well with the voters.
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:19.000]  In fact, field organizer Angel Alassea thinks all this talk of pronouns is actually a detriment to her campaign.
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  Don't tell her she's in front of her.
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  Really?
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  They choose the day-done pronouns.
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  It's like I'm so trying to get up to speed on that.
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  But at the end of the day, we become the party that has prioritized that rather than putting food on the table for working families.
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  It's like that's why we lose when we're zeroing in on something.
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  And I'm not saying it doesn't matter if you should make people feel comfortable and acceptable.
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  Sure, absolutely.
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  I call you whatever you want.
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  Yeah, when you put that over making sure people have decent jobs and health care,
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  I'm like, what the f*** is that writer over there, god damn losing election?
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  Yeah.
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  Warren's campaign believed they ticked off all the social justice boxes,
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  but when they didn't get the endorsement of the LGBTQ caucus in this day...
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  I kind of like this guy.
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:04.000] ...some staffers told our journalists how they really felt about the organization.
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  They're the chair of the Stem Law Caucus.
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  I like this guy.
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  I like this guy.
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  They have very little mouths of credibility that the membership is like 20 or 30 people.
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  And also, it's just like the way that they operate and like handle themselves.
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  She wins everything.
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  They literally, first of all, they were with Gillivant.
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  It's my second.
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  And then they really played hard to get, like trying to get us into their hands.
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  Yeah, they always have to put their social media accounts on private or even get rid of them after they're exposed by Project Veritas.
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  That's just practice right out of the Democrat party.
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  They're so used to it now.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  They've been exposed by Veritas over a dozen times.
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  So chief non-binary Pocahontas Warren...
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:51.000]  I mean, the Democrat party's a joke, man.
[2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:55.000]  I'll tell you, get out your clown horns and ride along.
[2:04:55.000 --> 2:04:59.000]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Info War, but I know you're like me.
[2:04:59.000 --> 2:05:01.000]  You don't want my thanks.
[2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  You want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters.
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:07.000]  And you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[2:05:07.000 --> 2:05:09.000]  And you know what? I'm the same way.
[2:05:09.000 --> 2:05:11.000]  And that's why we're on the same damn team.
[2:05:11.000 --> 2:05:20.000]  And it's why M4s has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against the globalist.
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  Because I'm committed to a future for humanity.
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:26.000]  And I know you are as well.
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the Info War.
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  And I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  For bottom my heart, for my family, and for the great crew at Info Wars.
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:41.000]  I want to thank you all because you are the Info War.
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:44.000]  And you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:47.000]  You have made history. We have made history together.
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:52.000]  InfoWars.com only has power because of you.
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:06:08.000]  And I suggest you use it.
[2:06:08.000 --> 2:06:10.000]  I'm just an average man.
[2:06:10.000 --> 2:06:13.000]  Okay. I've got some other news I want to get to here.
[2:06:13.000 --> 2:06:18.000]  Look, let me just say this about what's going on in the Democrat Party.
[2:06:18.000 --> 2:06:22.000]  Because I can't help myself sometimes.
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  I mean, I get all revved up here.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:27.000]  And it really is such a clown show what's going on over there.
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  But you know, there are good people that are still Democrat voters.
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  And there are good people I think with righteous causes that support Bernie Sanders.
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  And because of a lack of, let's say, an alternative, they stick by Bernie Sanders.
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:52.000]  And you know, he's the front runner for the Democrat Party.
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:55.000]  He should be the obvious choice for the Democrats.
[2:06:55.000 --> 2:06:57.000]  They just don't want him.
[2:06:57.000 --> 2:06:59.000]  And he's kind of okay with that.
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:01.000]  I don't think he wants to be president anyway.
[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  This guy's never held a job in his life outside of being a senator for what, 35 years or whatever now.
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:13.000]  What I just like to say is, I think that there's a lot of common ground
[2:07:13.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  between the non-insane Bernie Sanders supporter and the Trump base,
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  at least on the outset of the Trump, you know, announcement and campaign and everything.
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:31.000]  And that's, we are sick of the establishment.
[2:07:31.000 --> 2:07:33.000]  We know the establishment's corrupt.
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:35.000]  We know all these wars are fake.
[2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  We want to end these wars.
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  We want to bring the troops home.
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  We want to bring these funds back into our homeland as well.
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:44.000]  And so there's a lot of common ground there.
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:52.000]  And I think because of the total S show that has become the Democrat Party,
[2:07:52.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  Trump supporters and conservatives don't really endear themselves to this level of the Bernie Sanders support.
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:05.000]  And because of all the hype and disinformation and everything about Trump and its supporters,
[2:08:05.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  those same liberals or whatever that have a lot of common ground with Trump's base
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  can never come together because they still fall for some of that hype and fake news.
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:21.000]  So I don't know if there's an opportunity to bridge that gap.
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:25.000]  I don't know if it's possible, but I do think it's important to point that out.
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  The original outset base of support for Donald Trump is anti-establishment, governments corrupt in the foreign wars.
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:43.000]  That same fabric, that same thread is really woven in to, I would say, the Bernie Sanders base.
[2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:47.000]  Now, is there going to be radical people, obviously, on all sides of the aisle?
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  And you can sit here and make the argument, well, 90% of Bernie Sanders support is radical.
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  My point is this.
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:59.000]  There are good people that still identify as a liberal, that aren't radicals and that aren't leftists.
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:03.000]  And Bernie Sanders is really those people's candidate.
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  And some of them may like Warren or Klobacher or something.
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  But my point is, I think it's sad that we can't unite as Americans against the establishment,
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  against all these fake foreign wars costing us trillions of dollars,
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:24.000]  against the tech censorship, against the corrupt government.
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  And that's because of the wedge that continues to divide.
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  Now, I don't expect Bernie to do anything about this.
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  And quite frankly, I don't think Trump is going to either.
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  But at the end of the day, I think what's going to happen as this Democrat party deteriorates,
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  Bernie won't run as a third party candidate.
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  I think that Trump's support is only going to go up.
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  And I can tell you this for sure.
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:51.000]  I mean, I can't put a number on it.
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  But I can tell you that I know people that didn't vote for Trump in 2016,
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:10:01.000]  that will be voting for Trump guaranteed in 2020.
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  And you don't really have that phenomenon happening anywhere else with any other candidate right now.
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  So Trump political stock is just skyrocketing and everything on the Democrat side is just tanking.
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  I mean, tanking, tanking, tanking, tanking and tanking badly.
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  And again, it's important, folks.
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:23.000]  This is important.
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  No one else is reporting this, but this is important to point out.
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:33.000]  Bernie Sanders' support has dropped since the 2016 election.
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  Now, and that's for many reasons.
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  The biggest is because I think a lot of Bernie Sanders supporters saw that he's not going to fight for them
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  like he claimed he would, and he laid down to Hillary Clinton.
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  He laid down to the rigged election and he just laid down.
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  Plus, you know, some of these hot mics are kind of exposing Bernie as just kind of the jerk that he really is.
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  Of course, he's a jerk.
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:59.000]  But he should be leading the Democrat way.
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  If the Democrats were smart and they wanted to beat Trump,
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  they'd be putting everything behind Bernie Sanders.
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  They're not doing it.
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  They don't want him.
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  He's okay with it.
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  I don't think he wants to win anyway.
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:09.000]  So where does it go from here?
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:12.000]  I think Bernie's support continues to actually go down.
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  Yes, is he rising on the Democrat aisle?
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:18.000]  But that's because there's no other alternative.
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  If you look at the numbers, Bernie Sanders' support from 2016 to today is actually way down.
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  And you can use the Iowa caucus as a microcosm.
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  Bernie Sanders had less support by the numbers in this Iowa caucus than he did in 2016.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  And if you look at political trends, Bernie should have had a lot more support this time around.
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:50.000]  And the fact that he didn't means that those people are not coming back to Bernie Sanders.
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  Let me do some other political news here.
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:57.000]  And then I'm going to do some cultural news on the other side.
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  Boy, Adam Schiff.
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:03.000]  I mean, what more is there to say about this guy?
[2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  Barnum and Bailey's is hiring.
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  You know, he is the ringleader of the three ring circus.
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  A bug-eyed freak.
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  A guy who can't stop lying through his teeth.
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:27.000]  Now comes out and says on the impeachment floor that Trump is going to give Alaska to the Russians.
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  Oh, man.
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  What is Adam Schiff going to say or do next?
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  You know, I wonder, should I should prank call Adam Schiff?
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  I think I may prank call Adam Schiff and tell him I'm a Russian oligarch that has pictures of Donald Trump raping Daffy Duck.
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  And I bet Schiff would fall for it.
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  He'd probably be all over that one.
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  Man, I mean, can you imagine what this guy was doing with Ed Buck?
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  Please don't, folks.
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  Please don't.
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:07.000]  Bloomberg, Michael Bloomberg, many big gay ice cream Mike.
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  Bloomberg uses Obama era footage of kids in cages and anti-Trump Super Bowl ad.
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:13.000]  Isn't that hilarious?
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  They're still going with that fake news, even though it's been totally disproven.
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  They don't care.
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  These people are so filled with hate and vitriol.
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  They'll lie.
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:21.000]  They'll lie their way to the top.
[2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  And by the way, it's not working because people see through it.
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  And they know it's a fraud.
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  And so they can continue these lies, but it's not going to work.
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  And here's what I said.
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:47.000]  I'll get to this later, but Twitter just announced a new thing where you can report a tweet for being misleading about a political election.
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  Well, obviously that's meant to censor more Trump supporters and hurt Trump.
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  It's time for conservatives to use that against Democrats.
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  Democrats put out lies on Twitter all day long.
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  They put out misinformation about Trump all day long on Twitter.
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:01.000]  I suggest you go out there and report it.
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  Now, I did an example of this on my Twitter.
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  Maybe we'll play that video later, but seriously.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  So when Bloomberg puts out an ad on Twitter showing kids in cages saying Trump's doing this from the Obama years,
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:19.000]  that ad should be reported for misleading information about a political election and it should be taken down by Twitter.
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  I mean, that's what the report is for, right?
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  Of course not.
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:24.000]  It's to get Trump.
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  But why not use that tool against them?
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  Verman Supreme is winning the Libertarian 2020 presidential primaries.
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  Can you imagine if that literal boot head got presidential nomination?
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  I mean, that's kind of the status of where we're at politically right now, though, for real, the clown show that is.
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're about to go to a break.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  I'm going to get to some cultural news when we get back.
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  But remember, during this break, hop on over to infowarstore.com,
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  whether it's the emergency food supplies that you hope you never need, but it's insurance you can eat.

[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  Earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, coronaviruses, they break out.
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  You can't rely on the government.
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:08.000]  Rely on yourself.
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  The grocery stores are not going to have food and water ready for you, folks.
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:13.000]  You need to have that prepared for yourself.
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:15.000]  You can get those supplies at infowarstore.com.
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  Don't forget about the water filters as well.
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  And to build up your immune system.

[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:23.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look.
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:25.000]  And I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:27.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:33.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:56.000]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[2:17:56.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  It's amazing that we have the only patented nano silver that's been found by Homeland Security
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:06.000]  to check out SARS, which is the same family as the coronavirus.
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:09.000]  We have it in our super silver toothpaste.
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  We have it in our super blue toothpaste.
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:14.000]  We have it in the immune gargle products.
[2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:18.000]  And of course, it's in the super silver wound gel that is sold nationally.
[2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:24.000]  We just private label it from the people that produced the nano tech company out of Colorado.
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:30.000]  And we have a stockpile of it, but we've already sold half of the stockpile of it.
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:38.000]  And I'm still offering the products at 40 to 50% off at infowarstore.com until they sell out,
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:42.000]  which most of these products are set to sell out within days or then about another week.
[2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:46.000]  So go to infowarstore.com to get your immune gargle, to get the toothpaste,
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:48.000]  and to get the super silver wound gel.
[2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:53.000]  But the immune gargle is what is so important because you gargle with it and can also drink it.
[2:18:53.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  infowarstore.com.
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:58.000]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers of info wars.
[2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:06.000]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny,
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S. but worldwide.
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:16.000]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:22.000]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas.
[2:19:22.000 --> 2:19:26.000]  But trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China.
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:28.000]  Trump's been doing an amazing job.
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:35.000]  But now more than ever, we really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective.
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:40.000]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:42.000]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:48.000]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:50.000]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:57.000]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[2:19:57.000 --> 2:20:13.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:13.000 --> 2:20:20.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Owen Troyer sitting in for Alex today.
[2:20:20.000 --> 2:20:27.000]  He is on standby, maybe joining us later on this hour before Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:38.000]  Okay, you've obviously seen or heard of the half-time show, the ass-time show from JLo and Shakira.
[2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:48.000]  You've seen the response from America pretty much left a foul taste in most people's mouths,
[2:20:48.000 --> 2:20:52.000]  even though some people are pretending it was a smashing success that everybody loved.
[2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:54.000]  That's not actually the case.
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:21:05.000]  But you know, it's funny because what JLo and Shakira did during the half-time show,
[2:21:05.000 --> 2:21:13.000]  that used to be done by female sex slaves in chains.
[2:21:13.000 --> 2:21:18.000]  And so here we are the year 2020 and we've gotten rid of the chains.
[2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:23.000]  So yay feminism. Good for you guys.
[2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  What JLo and Shakira did used to be performed by female sex slaves to entertain the masses forced to do it in chains.
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:39.000]  We've gotten rid of the chains. It's 2020. Yay feminism. So good for them.
[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:50.000]  But I guess if you're not into strip teases and soft-core porn and stripper polls and sexual references during a half-time show,
[2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:54.000]  I guess that's your problem.
[2:21:54.000 --> 2:22:04.000]  By the way, the half-time show was produced by Jay-Z and Jay-Z and Beyonce decided not to stand for the national anthem.
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:09.000]  That's just their way of telling you you're a piece of garbage.
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:12.000]  They are more important than you. They are more important than America.
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:16.000]  They are more important than any soldier as well.
[2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:29.000]  I will just say this because this is something that I think a lot of people have trouble putting into words or vocalizing or really understanding.
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  And really, I heard Michael Savage put it better than anyone else yesterday.
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:41.000]  And I have to repeat it here on air.
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:54.000]  How in the hell did the lowest forms of humanity, how in the hell did this gutter trash become so rich and powerful in America?
[2:22:54.000 --> 2:22:58.000]  Do we ever ask ourselves that?
[2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:14.000]  How did these low-class, no-class, foul-mouthed, degenerate, hate-filled scum right out of the gutter become so rich and powerful in this country?
[2:23:14.000 --> 2:23:20.000]  How did that happen? How did we allow this to happen?
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  Now, some people might say there is a shadow force involved here, the Illuminati, the globalists, the secret societies, the Satanists.
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  You may be right. In fact, you are right.
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:46.000]  But aside from that complexity, I think that that kind of really sums up what we've done to create this Sodom and Gomorrah,
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:24:00.000]  what we've done celebrating Hollywood and uplifting people like Jay-Z and the rest of the Hollywood trash.
[2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:09.000]  This is human scum. This is the worst form of degeneracy. This is the worst influence on our children.
[2:24:09.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  And yet this is what's uplifted. This is what's idolized. This is what's celebrated.
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:19.000]  This is right out of the Bible, folks. This is Satan's hand.
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:34.000]  And of course, when all of these industries are controlled by a very few who behind closed doors worship Satan and engage in all sorts of things that you can't even imagine, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  beyond just Epstein Island, well, that's how you end up with this degenerative society.
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:51.000]  That's how you end up with a degenerative youth. That's how you end up with the human gutter trash of society becoming rich and powerful and idolized.
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  And we need to do everything we can to turn that trend back. Otherwise, it's going to kill us all.
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:13.000]  Now, some other developing news stories from the Super Bowl. People are mad online because the racist Kansas City chiefs want a Super Bowl.
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  Oh, no. Can you imagine?
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  Oh, yes, that's the Kansas City Tomahawk shop. I think they banned that from Atlanta Braves games.
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:36.000]  They banned Chief Woohoo off the Cleveland Indian hats, one of the greatest logos of all time.
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  The left literally destroys everything it touches.
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  And so I just want to say good for the Kansas City Chiefs and oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  No Native Americans were harmed in the mockup of the Arrowhead chop that I just performed here on air.
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:10.320]  But, you know, what's so pathetic is that it's like the same thing with in football,
[2:26:10.320 --> 2:26:15.840]  with the Redskins, and they don't know the history of the Redskins, why the name became
[2:26:15.840 --> 2:26:16.840]  Redskins.
[2:26:16.840 --> 2:26:27.760]  It was literally to actually show a, what's the word, a, it's paying homage to their old
[2:26:27.760 --> 2:26:30.960]  coach who was a Native American.
[2:26:30.960 --> 2:26:33.980]  So name Paul Brown.
[2:26:33.980 --> 2:26:36.520]  So people don't even know the history, but you know, it's, it's too bad.
[2:26:36.520 --> 2:26:41.680]  If you've never been to a Kansas City Chiefs football game with 80,000 people doing the
[2:26:41.680 --> 2:26:46.520]  Tomahawk chop, well, I guess you would hate it because you don't know how to have any
[2:26:46.520 --> 2:26:48.000]  fun.
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:52.720]  Chiefs head coach, Andy Reed, reveals if he's visiting the White House, basically said,
[2:26:52.720 --> 2:26:54.400]  yeah, of course I'm in, well, it's an honor.
[2:26:54.400 --> 2:26:55.400]  Why wouldn't I?
[2:26:55.400 --> 2:26:59.240]  It'd be interesting to see there was a Kansas City Chiefs player that wore a Trump Kanye
[2:26:59.240 --> 2:27:02.120]  West hoodie during media days.
[2:27:02.120 --> 2:27:04.480]  That drew some ire.
[2:27:04.480 --> 2:27:11.640]  I happen to know that the star player Patrick Mahomes from the Chiefs is a Christian.
[2:27:11.640 --> 2:27:17.200]  I won't say if he's a conservative or not, but very Christian conservative family, maybe
[2:27:17.200 --> 2:27:23.080]  not politically, but, you know, as far as their life practices are concerned, he was
[2:27:23.080 --> 2:27:25.200]  raised right.
[2:27:25.200 --> 2:27:31.240]  It was actually funny, I had a chance to meet them at the Dallas Cowboys football stadium
[2:27:31.240 --> 2:27:34.320]  for Pat Mahomes final game against Baylor.
[2:27:34.320 --> 2:27:38.800]  I forget what they call that rivalry when they play it down in Dallas.
[2:27:38.800 --> 2:27:44.000]  I was actually stunned because it was like all this hype about Mahomes and then the
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:49.000]  father, the mother, the girlfriend and Patrick, who's not even that big, were like the most
[2:27:49.000 --> 2:27:50.920]  humble people I'd ever met.
[2:27:50.920 --> 2:27:57.840]  It was like, wow, this doesn't look like the kind of people that are about to be some of
[2:27:57.840 --> 2:28:02.760]  the most famous people in the NFL, but I have a feeling that there's going to be some Kansas
[2:28:02.760 --> 2:28:08.640]  City Chiefs players that show some pretty strong support for Donald Trump at the White
[2:28:08.640 --> 2:28:09.640]  House.
[2:28:09.640 --> 2:28:11.560]  I'm not sure when that happens.
[2:28:11.560 --> 2:28:13.600]  This is from Campus Reform.
[2:28:13.600 --> 2:28:18.240]  Cabot Phillips, who I really don't like promoting because he's one of these stick-in-the-mud
[2:28:18.240 --> 2:28:22.720]  conservatives who hates infowars and everything, but he does do good work.
[2:28:22.720 --> 2:28:27.280]  Students hate Trump's State of the Union quotes until they find out it's actually quotes
[2:28:27.280 --> 2:28:28.280]  from 2020 Democrats.
[2:28:28.280 --> 2:28:33.920]  Yeah, you can fool these sad, liberal students pretty easily.
[2:28:33.920 --> 2:28:42.040]  But Trump's State of the Union is tonight, so that'll be an interesting one to see tonight.
[2:28:42.040 --> 2:28:43.600]  Trump's State of the Union address.
[2:28:43.600 --> 2:28:47.240]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we go to a break now.
[2:28:47.240 --> 2:28:54.000]  Here in this short break, go over to infowarsstore.com, get yourself some super silver toothpaste.
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:58.560]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[2:28:58.560 --> 2:29:00.480]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[2:29:00.480 --> 2:29:02.200]  I had a problem like you once.
[2:29:02.200 --> 2:29:07.640]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[2:29:07.640 --> 2:29:08.760]  my life.
[2:29:08.760 --> 2:29:14.000]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:18.600]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it
[2:29:18.600 --> 2:29:22.320]  alone, you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[2:29:22.320 --> 2:29:27.040]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[2:29:27.040 --> 2:29:29.320]  and totally change your life.
[2:29:29.320 --> 2:29:34.560]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[2:29:34.560 --> 2:29:37.840]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[2:29:37.840 --> 2:29:38.840]  Get clean.
[2:29:38.840 --> 2:29:53.240]  Until now and learn more, 800-506-6740, 800-506-6740, that's 800-506-6740.
[2:29:53.240 --> 2:30:00.560]  Folks, once you need the food, once you need the water filters, once you need the masks,
[2:30:00.560 --> 2:30:01.880]  it'll be too late to get them.
[2:30:01.880 --> 2:30:07.480]  You've got to get them now before you find that you require them for survival.
[2:30:07.480 --> 2:30:08.480]  Trust us.
[2:30:08.480 --> 2:30:10.720]  It's not something to be messing around with.
[2:30:10.720 --> 2:30:16.520]  Please go to InfowarsStore.com, make your purchase today, and at least have that part
[2:30:16.520 --> 2:30:22.840]  of survival covered, the food, the time it will take for the rest of society to collapse
[2:30:22.840 --> 2:30:27.920]  or calm down or whatever the case may be, the RZ air filtration mask, M2 mesh, I have
[2:30:27.920 --> 2:30:28.920]  one of those personally.
[2:30:28.920 --> 2:30:32.480]  I've got a couple of these things off the old Infowars Store.
[2:30:32.480 --> 2:30:33.480]  I am prepared.
[2:30:33.480 --> 2:30:37.160]  Are you, if you're not, InfowarsStore.com on sale now.
[2:30:37.160 --> 2:30:39.640]  Something you need to prepare yourself for, whatever comes next, folks.
[2:30:39.640 --> 2:30:41.800]  It's not necessarily the disease.
[2:30:41.800 --> 2:30:44.040]  It's the panic that surrounds the disease.
[2:30:44.040 --> 2:30:47.960]  It's the collapse that the disease would bring upon that you need to be prepared for.
[2:30:47.960 --> 2:30:49.520]  Food will be off the shelves.
[2:30:49.520 --> 2:30:50.520]  Water won't be available.
[2:30:50.520 --> 2:30:52.160]  You might not even be able to leave your house.
[2:30:52.160 --> 2:30:55.160]  You've got to be prepared before it comes down.
[2:30:55.160 --> 2:31:00.720]  We've got three big sales going right now, and one of them has to end within a week.
[2:31:00.720 --> 2:31:06.360]  And that's ultimate fish oil for 33% off.
[2:31:06.360 --> 2:31:07.360]  It's amazing.
[2:31:07.360 --> 2:31:08.800]  Go check it out for yourself.
[2:31:08.800 --> 2:31:15.080]  Then we've got back in stock X2, our best-selling deep earth crystals iodine, the good halogen
[2:31:15.080 --> 2:31:18.160]  that is the building block to everything in the body, and I just can't tell you enough
[2:31:18.160 --> 2:31:19.320]  how important it is.
[2:31:19.320 --> 2:31:23.200]  The UN admits two billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never
[2:31:23.200 --> 2:31:24.200]  got enough iodine.
[2:31:24.200 --> 2:31:29.400]  So just check it out for yourself, 40% off, InfowarsStore.com, and it funds the M4.
[2:31:29.400 --> 2:31:34.160]  And then vitamin D3 with vitamin K that fuses it together.
[2:31:34.160 --> 2:31:36.320]  Correct quality, winter sun.
[2:31:36.320 --> 2:31:38.280]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[2:31:38.280 --> 2:31:40.880]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[2:31:40.880 --> 2:31:42.080]  That's why people get so sick.
[2:31:42.080 --> 2:31:43.080]  That's the main reason.
[2:31:43.080 --> 2:31:45.960]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue, get higher absorption.
[2:31:45.960 --> 2:31:46.960]  It's amazing.
[2:31:46.960 --> 2:31:50.880]  All three of these are on sale, but only for a limited time at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:31:50.880 --> 2:31:54.040]  Protect yourself and fund the M4.
[2:31:54.040 --> 2:31:56.040]  360 win.
[2:31:56.040 --> 2:31:58.480]  The demand for food has not let up.
[2:31:58.480 --> 2:32:01.160]  We are selling record amounts of it.
[2:32:01.160 --> 2:32:03.480]  Everybody else has basically already sold out.
[2:32:03.480 --> 2:32:05.560]  Or they have a giant wait list.
[2:32:05.560 --> 2:32:10.440]  Our suppliers have it in-house, mistaken 7 to 10 days to deliver, because again, they
[2:32:10.440 --> 2:32:11.440]  have to package it.
[2:32:11.440 --> 2:32:13.600]  They're running 24 hours a day.
[2:32:13.600 --> 2:32:17.160]  But in a few days, they're telling me it may go to a longer wait if you haven't gotten
[2:32:17.160 --> 2:32:18.160]  your order in.
[2:32:18.160 --> 2:32:19.400]  So I wouldn't crash the name.
[2:32:19.400 --> 2:32:21.480]  We wanted this virus to be peering out.
[2:32:21.480 --> 2:32:23.080]  We wanted it to just be hype.
[2:32:23.080 --> 2:32:26.120]  Looks like it is really, really bad and is man-made.
[2:32:26.120 --> 2:32:28.720]  And so that's why we're seeing the huge freakouts.
[2:32:28.720 --> 2:32:32.040]  So get your storable food at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:32:32.040 --> 2:32:33.040]  That helps fund our operation.
[2:32:33.040 --> 2:32:34.040]  And it's insurance.
[2:32:34.040 --> 2:32:35.720]  You can eat a total 360 win.
[2:32:35.720 --> 2:32:39.360]  Again, get your food and actually get it delivered at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:32:39.360 --> 2:32:41.360]  Get your order in.
[2:32:41.360 --> 2:32:42.360]  It's locked in.
[2:32:42.360 --> 2:32:43.760]  Guaranteed 7 to 10 days.
[2:32:43.760 --> 2:32:46.040]  InfowarsStore.com.
[2:32:46.040 --> 2:32:47.840]  And regardless, it funds the operation.
[2:32:47.840 --> 2:32:50.000]  We also have the immune gargle at 40% off.
[2:32:50.000 --> 2:32:51.000]  We are going to sell out of that.
[2:32:51.000 --> 2:33:07.280]  But I'm just keeping it at that sales price
[2:33:07.280 --> 2:33:16.120]  InfowarsStore.com.
[2:33:16.120 --> 2:33:17.840]  You want to stop tyranny?
[2:33:17.840 --> 2:33:19.600]  Well, so does he.
[2:33:19.600 --> 2:33:21.520]  That's Alex Jones.
[2:33:21.520 --> 2:33:32.800]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[2:33:32.800 --> 2:33:45.120]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:45.120 --> 2:33:50.920]  This is on standby, maybe joining us at any moment here now, Owen Troyer with you.
[2:33:50.920 --> 2:33:54.920]  Paul Joseph Watson will be hosting the fourth hour.
[2:33:54.920 --> 2:33:59.680]  I've got a couple of news stories to get to here, a couple of clips.
[2:33:59.680 --> 2:34:01.480]  How about this craziness?
[2:34:01.480 --> 2:34:05.480]  We've heard about this before, but it continues.
[2:34:05.480 --> 2:34:06.840]  Headline from The Guardian.
[2:34:06.840 --> 2:34:14.120]  Why liberal white women pay a lot of money to learn over dinner how they're racist?
[2:34:14.120 --> 2:34:18.880]  Wow.
[2:34:18.880 --> 2:34:21.240]  How about that?
[2:34:21.240 --> 2:34:31.000]  So you can pay $2,500 as a white woman to be lectured by black women and other women
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:36.840]  that aren't white, how you are a racist boy.
[2:34:36.840 --> 2:34:39.120]  Talk about pathetic.
[2:34:39.120 --> 2:34:44.320]  It's crazy, isn't it?
[2:34:44.320 --> 2:34:45.320]  It's real crazy.
[2:34:45.320 --> 2:34:52.440]  Imagine just a neutral, like an alien lands here, like high IQ intelligence, lands in
[2:34:52.440 --> 2:35:00.320]  America and some some leftist is trying to explain to them how the world works and says
[2:35:00.320 --> 2:35:06.360]  all this crap about how white people are racist and then it's like the aliens like, you know,
[2:35:06.360 --> 2:35:16.160]  it actually sounds like you're racist against white people be like, ah, yeah.
[2:35:16.160 --> 2:35:18.360]  Now you get it.
[2:35:18.360 --> 2:35:24.560]  Greta put them against the wall and fire Thunberg nominated for Nobel Peace Prize.
[2:35:24.560 --> 2:35:26.880]  You know, isn't it sad?
[2:35:26.880 --> 2:35:33.480]  The lengths that the left will go to these days to perpetuate false narratives and to
[2:35:33.480 --> 2:35:36.560]  shove lies down your throat.
[2:35:36.560 --> 2:35:39.440]  And you know what the sickest part about it is?
[2:35:39.440 --> 2:35:46.040]  They know they're lying and they don't care because that's how much they hate you.
[2:35:46.040 --> 2:35:51.760]  I can't even imagine because it's one thing to be a pathological liar.
[2:35:51.760 --> 2:35:59.160]  It's an entire another system of evil to be a conscious deceiver and that's who these
[2:35:59.160 --> 2:36:03.280]  people are.
[2:36:03.280 --> 2:36:09.160]  And they're now psychologically torturing children.
[2:36:09.160 --> 2:36:13.760]  Greta Thunberg is just a pawn in a game.
[2:36:13.760 --> 2:36:15.840]  But they're psychologically torturing.
[2:36:15.840 --> 2:36:21.680]  Yeah, Greta Thunberg, but just children in general saying you're going to die if we
[2:36:21.680 --> 2:36:23.600]  don't do something about climate change.
[2:36:23.600 --> 2:36:28.120]  And then of course, rational people are like, uh, no, we're not going to fall for your false
[2:36:28.120 --> 2:36:29.120]  narrative.
[2:36:29.120 --> 2:36:31.760]  We're going to go ahead and live our lives and be productive and build things and have
[2:36:31.760 --> 2:36:34.200]  industry and have agriculture.
[2:36:34.200 --> 2:36:36.480]  You can go live in a pot and eat a bug if you want.
[2:36:36.480 --> 2:36:39.040]  We're good.
[2:36:39.040 --> 2:36:43.120]  And then the kids see this indoctrinated by their professors indoctrinated by the mainstream
[2:36:43.120 --> 2:36:44.120]  media.
[2:36:44.120 --> 2:36:46.800]  I mean, just look at what they've done to that poor girl.
[2:36:46.800 --> 2:36:51.360]  You can see, I mean, like if you saw Greta Thunberg like walk around, you'd think she
[2:36:51.360 --> 2:36:52.640]  was a torture victim.
[2:36:52.640 --> 2:36:54.160]  Well, she is.
[2:36:54.160 --> 2:36:58.000]  She's been psychologically tortured by the left.
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:01.000]  That is a torture victim, folks.
[2:37:01.000 --> 2:37:03.440]  Makes my heart.
[2:37:03.440 --> 2:37:11.080]  And then they know that conservatives respond harshly to lies and misinformation.
[2:37:11.080 --> 2:37:16.440]  And so they put her out there like a scarecrow, hoping conservatives will target her.
[2:37:16.440 --> 2:37:22.960]  So not only do they use Greta Thunberg as a pawn in a lie that they've concocted and
[2:37:22.960 --> 2:37:30.440]  conceived, they then put her out there as a punching bag to be beaten by people who
[2:37:30.440 --> 2:37:33.880]  simply don't want to be lied to.
[2:37:33.880 --> 2:37:39.200]  This is the sickness that is the left.
[2:37:39.200 --> 2:37:45.880]  Psychologically torturing children with their lies, all for a political agenda.
[2:37:45.880 --> 2:37:49.240]  Breaks my heart.
[2:37:49.240 --> 2:37:53.200]  Really breaks my heart.
[2:37:53.200 --> 2:37:58.360]  I wonder where it goes from here for the left, because you got to understand something.
[2:37:58.360 --> 2:38:03.000]  It's really easy for us to forget about the headlines they ran hundreds of years ago about
[2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:07.520]  all the icebergs melting and global warming, then global cooling, then there's going to
[2:38:07.520 --> 2:38:13.880]  be an ice age, then acid rain is going to kill us all, the Al Gore documentary.
[2:38:13.880 --> 2:38:18.560]  It was real easy for them to get us to forget about that when all we had was print media
[2:38:18.560 --> 2:38:24.920]  and all we had was, you know, five systems of media that that owned the entire landscape
[2:38:24.920 --> 2:38:26.520]  of quote unquote news.
[2:38:26.520 --> 2:38:30.120]  Now, we have the internet for a memory poll.
[2:38:30.120 --> 2:38:31.680]  Now we have independent news.
[2:38:31.680 --> 2:38:33.000]  Now we have the studies.
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:34.000]  Now we have the research.
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:36.040]  We have the Vostok ice core samples.
[2:38:36.040 --> 2:38:42.960]  It's all been a big lie, but they still don't stop.
[2:38:42.960 --> 2:38:47.960]  And so, you know, people will come on here and say, oh, you know, they're not Satanists.
[2:38:47.960 --> 2:38:48.960]  They're not Luciferians.
[2:38:48.960 --> 2:38:52.040]  No, you don't understand.
[2:38:52.040 --> 2:39:02.580]  Satan's modus operandi, Satan's mode of getting around is deception is lies.
[2:39:02.580 --> 2:39:08.920]  So when you have conscious deceivers, consciously engaging in deception for a political agenda,
[2:39:08.920 --> 2:39:10.480]  that is Satanism.
[2:39:10.480 --> 2:39:16.360]  Now, they might not be actively practicing Luciferianism or doing human sacrifice.
[2:39:16.360 --> 2:39:18.640]  We know some of them do.
[2:39:18.640 --> 2:39:26.960]  The point is they're actively engaging in Satanism by their practice, by their agenda,
[2:39:26.960 --> 2:39:27.960]  by their results.
[2:39:27.960 --> 2:39:32.080]  You know, by the way, I forget the name of the rapper.
[2:39:32.080 --> 2:39:35.120]  I think his name was like noir or something.
[2:39:35.120 --> 2:39:43.640]  Anyway, he got really famous, really fast, was filling arenas and then kind of fell off
[2:39:43.640 --> 2:39:44.640]  the table.
[2:39:44.640 --> 2:39:48.760]  And he did a candid interview basically saying, you know, if you want to be famous in the
[2:39:48.760 --> 2:39:52.800]  rap game and he wasn't talking about anything else, this was just his experience in rap
[2:39:52.800 --> 2:39:53.800]  and hip hop.
[2:39:53.800 --> 2:39:54.800]  And he went off on his own.
[2:39:54.800 --> 2:39:58.360]  He said, if you want to get famous in the rap game, you basically have three doors.
[2:39:58.360 --> 2:40:05.520]  Once you once you reach that, you know, once you reach that, you know, point of your career
[2:40:05.520 --> 2:40:10.400]  where it's like, you know, looking up, you have three choices.
[2:40:10.400 --> 2:40:15.600]  One is to go homosexual and then they use that to blackmail you.
[2:40:15.600 --> 2:40:18.960]  In fact, DMX used to rap about this.
[2:40:18.960 --> 2:40:23.280]  The other is to engage in human sacrifice and they have blackmail on you.
[2:40:23.280 --> 2:40:25.520]  Or the third is to try to make it on your own.
[2:40:25.520 --> 2:40:26.520]  Good luck.
[2:40:26.520 --> 2:40:29.520]  You're done getting any help from the system, any help from the establishment, any help
[2:40:29.520 --> 2:40:34.560]  from the mega money that makes people rich and famous like Jay-Z.
[2:40:34.560 --> 2:40:36.400]  I wish I could remember that rapper's name.
[2:40:36.400 --> 2:40:39.040]  It was like noir or noir or something like that.
[2:40:39.040 --> 2:40:40.040]  But he just laid it out.
[2:40:40.040 --> 2:40:41.040]  He was like, yeah.
[2:40:41.040 --> 2:40:49.120]  I was like, you know, I'm not S and a D. You know, I'm not doing human sacrifice.
[2:40:49.120 --> 2:40:50.800]  I'll go ahead and make it on my own.
[2:40:50.800 --> 2:40:56.800]  He did quite well for himself, but obviously you've never heard of him because unless you
[2:40:56.800 --> 2:41:02.040]  take one of those two doors, homosexual agenda or the human sacrifice agenda, you don't get
[2:41:02.040 --> 2:41:05.200]  to be rich and famous like Jay-Z.
[2:41:05.200 --> 2:41:07.640]  I wish I could remember that rapper's name.
[2:41:07.640 --> 2:41:09.520]  But that's how these people work, folks.
[2:41:09.520 --> 2:41:11.960]  That's how the Satanists work behind closed doors.
[2:41:11.960 --> 2:41:17.880]  That's the, I mean, I hate using the word Illuminati because it's just been so twisted
[2:41:17.880 --> 2:41:26.600]  and it's not even what it originally was out of the old German expression and the secret
[2:41:26.600 --> 2:41:29.160]  societies that it was.
[2:41:29.160 --> 2:41:33.360]  It's now like something totally different in pop culture.
[2:41:33.360 --> 2:41:39.600]  But what it really is behind closed doors is human sacrifice, Satanism, blackmail, sex
[2:41:39.600 --> 2:41:46.680]  rings, sex parties, total deception, total poisoning of the human body, mind and spirit.
[2:41:46.680 --> 2:41:48.040]  That's what these people engage in.
[2:41:48.040 --> 2:41:55.400]  And if you really want to get down to it, folks, you really want to get down to it.
[2:41:55.400 --> 2:42:00.040]  I mean, it's, folks, it's no secret.
[2:42:00.040 --> 2:42:01.040]  It's biblical.
[2:42:01.040 --> 2:42:02.040]  It's ancient history.
[2:42:02.040 --> 2:42:03.040]  It's been written about.
[2:42:03.040 --> 2:42:05.360]  It's been carved on walls.
[2:42:05.360 --> 2:42:06.760]  There are spirits among us.
[2:42:06.760 --> 2:42:09.120]  There are entities among us.
[2:42:09.120 --> 2:42:12.480]  There's multiple dimensions all around us.
[2:42:12.480 --> 2:42:18.880]  It's all here in one plane, but we exist in the third dimension, see in the third dimension,
[2:42:18.880 --> 2:42:20.360]  operate in the third dimension.
[2:42:20.360 --> 2:42:23.120]  But there's doorways to these other dimensions.
[2:42:23.120 --> 2:42:27.400]  There's pathways of communications to literal demons.
[2:42:27.400 --> 2:42:28.680]  And that's who they communicate with.
[2:42:28.680 --> 2:42:32.760]  And, I mean, you know, you can imagine you're sitting in the room with a demon communicating
[2:42:32.760 --> 2:42:33.760]  with it.
[2:42:33.760 --> 2:42:34.760]  You feel pretty empowered.
[2:42:34.760 --> 2:42:39.440]  But then the separation from God is what kills you in the long run.
[2:42:39.440 --> 2:42:44.000]  All right, another segment with me coming up, I got a couple more news stories, a couple
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  more clips.
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:46.000]  Alex Jones may be joining us.
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:48.600]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[2:42:48.600 --> 2:42:53.760]  Remember folks, you got four minutes to go to infowarstore.com right now.
[2:42:53.760 --> 2:42:58.000]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:42:59.800]  for maybe the last week and a half.
[2:42:59.800 --> 2:43:03.200]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[2:43:03.200 --> 2:43:05.560]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[2:43:05.560 --> 2:43:07.360]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[2:43:07.360 --> 2:43:13.520]  So here I am telling people, super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste
[2:43:13.520 --> 2:43:15.000]  I've ever tried.
[2:43:15.000 --> 2:43:18.920]  And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride
[2:43:18.920 --> 2:43:19.920]  free.
[2:43:19.920 --> 2:43:23.920]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after
[2:43:23.920 --> 2:43:28.320]  I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even
[2:43:28.320 --> 2:43:31.360]  like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[2:43:31.360 --> 2:43:32.680]  It feels so good.
[2:43:32.680 --> 2:43:36.840]  It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[2:43:36.840 --> 2:43:42.080]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice
[2:43:42.080 --> 2:43:46.440]  a day now because I like the way it feels.
[2:43:46.440 --> 2:43:54.560]  Well, it's here.
[2:43:54.560 --> 2:43:56.200]  The year 2020.
[2:43:56.200 --> 2:43:57.520]  World governments out in the open.
[2:43:57.520 --> 2:44:01.360]  We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as the
[2:44:01.360 --> 2:44:02.360]  answer.
[2:44:02.360 --> 2:44:07.760]  And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place that's coordinated by big tech and banks
[2:44:07.760 --> 2:44:14.120]  against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the
[2:44:14.120 --> 2:44:15.800]  protection of the unborn.
[2:44:15.800 --> 2:44:16.800]  Wow.
[2:44:16.800 --> 2:44:17.800]  Yes.
[2:44:17.800 --> 2:44:18.800]  Now we know we're right.
[2:44:18.800 --> 2:44:19.800]  The new world order is real.
[2:44:19.800 --> 2:44:20.800]  Satanism is real.
[2:44:20.800 --> 2:44:24.520]  The pedophile leader real, but we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up
[2:44:24.520 --> 2:44:25.520]  and saying no.
[2:44:25.520 --> 2:44:29.520]  But I just want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we have never been in
[2:44:29.520 --> 2:44:30.520]  Kansas.
[2:44:30.520 --> 2:44:34.320]  We have never been in some small, little place that didn't matter.
[2:44:34.320 --> 2:44:39.200]  Everything we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything
[2:44:39.200 --> 2:44:40.920]  we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[2:44:40.920 --> 2:44:44.240]  So it's an incredible time to be alive and I want to thank you all for being aware and
[2:44:44.240 --> 2:44:45.240]  being involved.
[2:44:45.240 --> 2:44:50.560]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth, and financial support of M-4
[2:44:50.560 --> 2:44:57.560]  is critical, so please take action.
[2:45:50.560 --> 2:46:00.560]  It was about a week and a half ago that my father came rushing into my office in the
[2:46:00.560 --> 2:46:05.720]  morning and said, son, you've got to see this, the company that holds the patents on the
[2:46:05.720 --> 2:46:09.600]  nano silver that's in our toothpaste, that's in our immune garden, that's in some of the
[2:46:09.600 --> 2:46:16.200]  other great products like the super silver wound shell, had reports from back in 2007
[2:46:16.200 --> 2:46:21.040]  with the Pentagon working with A&M and Homeland Security, with the director of Homeland Security
[2:46:21.040 --> 2:46:27.480]  certifying an unrestricted document, confidential documents was noted as, that this had been
[2:46:27.480 --> 2:46:30.480]  proven in their secret test to be knocking out SARS.
[2:46:30.480 --> 2:46:35.480]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, regardless, now they authorized us to talk about this.
[2:46:35.480 --> 2:46:38.880]  I talked about it on the show last week, just hiding in plain view.
[2:46:38.880 --> 2:46:44.120]  This is a product that we had stockpiled and we're still selling it 40% off or more with
[2:46:44.120 --> 2:46:47.560]  the combos, so you can get it in your hands, it's something that's good for everyday use
[2:46:47.560 --> 2:46:52.440]  regardless, and it funds the operation, so infowarstore.com for your immune garden and
[2:46:52.440 --> 2:46:58.200]  other products that contain this key now silver.
[2:46:58.200 --> 2:47:09.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:09.080 --> 2:47:16.080]  You've found it, the tip of the spear, it is, the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:16.080 --> 2:47:26.560]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here in the final segment of this hour before Paul
[2:47:26.560 --> 2:47:31.360]  Joseph Watson takes over at the helm and then the war room kicks back off with yours truly.
[2:47:31.360 --> 2:47:34.040]  I went Troyer back from the dead.
[2:47:34.040 --> 2:47:37.960]  I of course told people for a long time I haven't had a vacation over a year, my wife
[2:47:37.960 --> 2:47:42.320]  really wants to go on one, we went on a work vacation, but I'm getting plane tickets right
[2:47:42.320 --> 2:47:46.480]  now to fly back to Austin, so I'll be there during the show or after the show tomorrow
[2:47:46.480 --> 2:47:49.320]  because it's the news, it's too intense, it's too dangerous.
[2:47:49.320 --> 2:47:54.120]  I had decided that I would just go with, we don't know what this virus and looks like
[2:47:54.120 --> 2:47:59.080]  a big UN worldwide panic drill, be able to establish world government and certainly they're
[2:47:59.080 --> 2:48:04.320]  using it for that, but now it's been off for over a week and they haven't been able to
[2:48:04.320 --> 2:48:09.800]  deny it that bio research laboratories and top universities have scanned it and are saying
[2:48:09.800 --> 2:48:16.280]  that it's clearly manmade and it's had the HIV delivery system added to it.
[2:48:16.280 --> 2:48:21.960]  Well, now the creator of US Bio Weapons Axis Coronavirus is biological warfare weapon.
[2:48:21.960 --> 2:48:25.800]  We played clips of him breaking that down in exclusive interview last hour that he did
[2:48:25.800 --> 2:48:30.880]  it on another show, but he'll be joining us tomorrow for his second interview, Dr. Francis
[2:48:30.880 --> 2:48:37.000]  Boyle, the author of the US Biological Weapons Act, which became the UN Act and was basically
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:38.720]  adopted.
[2:48:38.720 --> 2:48:44.280]  So he's the author by having a ratify of the US Congress and adopted by the UN with a few
[2:48:44.280 --> 2:48:49.880]  changes of the World Biological Weapons Treaty basically in 1989.
[2:48:49.880 --> 2:48:52.880]  And so this is a big, big deal.
[2:48:52.880 --> 2:48:58.200]  And he's saying the UN all knows, he's talked to the people involved and that's why prestigious
[2:48:58.200 --> 2:49:03.320]  universities and others have put reports saying, hey, this is totally manufactured.
[2:49:03.320 --> 2:49:04.320]  It's textbook.
[2:49:04.320 --> 2:49:08.760]  It's got the remnants of where the new RNA is added in, where it's welded together.
[2:49:08.760 --> 2:49:12.560]  You can under electron microscope, they have shots of it, see where it's welded in.
[2:49:12.560 --> 2:49:16.000]  And I use this analogy on the Sunday show.
[2:49:16.000 --> 2:49:18.000]  Nothing wrong with women with silicon parts.
[2:49:18.000 --> 2:49:23.560]  I don't agree with Sir Mix-A-Lot, but you know, you can tell when there's the incisions
[2:49:23.560 --> 2:49:25.400]  under there that there's been stuff added.
[2:49:25.400 --> 2:49:27.440]  I mean, it's that ridiculous.
[2:49:27.440 --> 2:49:35.000]  It's cut in like a piece of a pie right into there and it's got the remnant genes in it.
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:40.840]  Just absolutely insane that they did this, the P Shuttle-SN.
[2:49:40.840 --> 2:49:47.400]  And Zach Voorhees points out a really, really important point that's also in that same paper
[2:49:47.400 --> 2:49:50.320]  and other scientific groups are looking at it and concurring.
[2:49:50.320 --> 2:49:55.120]  According to Chinese scientists, the coronavirus attaches onto lung receptors through the mucous
[2:49:55.120 --> 2:50:01.280]  membrane that are five times more likely in Asian males, literally genetically engineered
[2:50:01.280 --> 2:50:02.840]  for Asian males.
[2:50:02.840 --> 2:50:08.840]  Also white people are essentially immune because we have the inhibitor against the virus.
[2:50:08.840 --> 2:50:09.840]  And then it just goes through all that.
[2:50:09.840 --> 2:50:14.720]  And that's why they always said that HIV was a biological weapon against blacks, because
[2:50:14.720 --> 2:50:20.720]  yeah, whites can get it, but it's the T lymphocytes in Northern Europe, especially, do not have
[2:50:20.720 --> 2:50:21.720]  the attachments.
[2:50:21.720 --> 2:50:27.720]  Because Northern Europeans aren't from Spain, where Africa invaded and stuff like that happened.
[2:50:27.720 --> 2:50:33.200]  They aren't able to basically get it unless they have compromised immune systems and kind
[2:50:33.200 --> 2:50:39.880]  of say on air why, but let's just say a lot of drugs and a lot of artificial outside blood
[2:50:39.880 --> 2:50:42.720]  product into the body and you know how that gets in there.
[2:50:42.720 --> 2:50:46.280]  So this is just crazy.
[2:50:46.280 --> 2:50:49.560]  And the fact that it's released in China, the fact there's evidence they stole it out
[2:50:49.560 --> 2:50:52.320]  of a lab up in Canada.
[2:50:52.320 --> 2:50:57.640]  And now this hysterical response is just absolutely insane, but I want to be clear.
[2:50:57.640 --> 2:51:03.160]  The HIV delivery system is not HIV, it's the delivery system.
[2:51:03.160 --> 2:51:09.920]  But that's how you know it's not the original HIV virus and it's the delivery system for
[2:51:09.920 --> 2:51:10.920]  it.
[2:51:10.920 --> 2:51:15.320]  And that does hit certain racial groups in different ways.
[2:51:15.320 --> 2:51:18.600]  Basically, it's, but that's what all the experts have said.
[2:51:18.600 --> 2:51:21.640]  I mean, HIV is designed to kill black people.
[2:51:21.640 --> 2:51:25.000]  And then what happens is it mutates after a while and stops doing it.
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:28.000]  That's why then there's always going to be new U.N. vaccination programs with special
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:32.520]  vaccines because it's been proven that it could be isolated inside another vaccine
[2:51:32.520 --> 2:51:35.800]  product and get through screening process and hit people.
[2:51:35.800 --> 2:51:37.920]  But that's in the old fashioned days.
[2:51:37.920 --> 2:51:38.920]  Now they try to suppress.
[2:51:38.920 --> 2:51:40.400]  And again, it's not the U.S. government doing this.
[2:51:40.400 --> 2:51:42.120]  It's a global U.N.
[2:51:42.120 --> 2:51:48.440]  World Government Agreement after World War II to dehumanize people, to make men not manly
[2:51:48.440 --> 2:51:52.880]  to destroy the family in the name of creating world peace because powerful, virile men,
[2:51:52.880 --> 2:51:55.840]  well, they'll start a war and, well, you got too many people.
[2:51:55.840 --> 2:51:57.520]  And there's arguments to all of that.
[2:51:57.520 --> 2:52:02.080]  But the fact is it's a planetary regime doing it, they're the real threat.
[2:52:02.080 --> 2:52:04.000]  They are the psychotics.
[2:52:04.000 --> 2:52:11.480]  So there's all these different ways that the HIV virus is able to plug in to people that
[2:52:11.480 --> 2:52:12.480]  are not white.
[2:52:12.480 --> 2:52:15.480]  And it really is a race specific bio weapon.
[2:52:15.480 --> 2:52:21.240]  And we have Dick Cheney in Rebuilding America's Defenses, a April 2000 report for the Project
[2:52:21.240 --> 2:52:29.960]  for the American Century saying it's time to legitimize the use of race specific bio weapons.
[2:52:29.960 --> 2:52:32.880]  And again, I don't want to kill all the Chinese people, I don't want to kill all the white
[2:52:32.880 --> 2:52:33.880]  people, all the white people.
[2:52:33.880 --> 2:52:36.640]  But you've got the media saying white's are the devil, destroy them.
[2:52:36.640 --> 2:52:39.920]  That's the same corporate media owned by the same shadow groups that have been caught
[2:52:39.920 --> 2:52:41.200]  running all these bio attacks.
[2:52:41.200 --> 2:52:43.760]  So why did this get released in China?
[2:52:43.760 --> 2:52:45.080]  Why is China freaking out?
[2:52:45.080 --> 2:52:49.520]  Why is China saying the U.S. should stay open to China, but not saying a word about
[2:52:49.520 --> 2:52:57.920]  it when Russia and others completely, Mongolia, countless others, the Philippines, closed
[2:52:57.920 --> 2:52:58.920]  their borders.
[2:52:58.920 --> 2:53:00.760]  This is a big deal now.
[2:53:00.760 --> 2:53:04.960]  And we know it's manmade and this is just unbelievable off the charts.
[2:53:04.960 --> 2:53:08.160]  And again, we're going to have poll watching covering so many other issues in the next
[2:53:08.160 --> 2:53:09.160]  hour.
[2:53:09.160 --> 2:53:12.480]  And Russia limbo having lung cancer is big news.
[2:53:12.480 --> 2:53:16.160]  And the incredible fiasco in the Senate's big news and the Democrats saying they got
[2:53:16.160 --> 2:53:18.680]  more impeachment coming forward, it's huge news.
[2:53:18.680 --> 2:53:24.240]  And the Iowa caucus is being rigged against Bernie Sanders just like four years ago.
[2:53:24.240 --> 2:53:25.240]  It's huge news.
[2:53:25.240 --> 2:53:27.720]  It just shows that the criminality is out in the open.
[2:53:27.720 --> 2:53:30.560]  It's a bunch of gangs battling for supremacy.
[2:53:30.560 --> 2:53:36.840]  And I believe Trump represents is the common sense pragmatic coupling of different organizations
[2:53:36.840 --> 2:53:40.440]  that don't want World War three and one prosperity and a pro human future.
[2:53:40.440 --> 2:53:42.440]  That's why I bet on Trump.
[2:53:42.440 --> 2:53:46.200]  Not him not standing up against censorship and against the organized crime of the big
[2:53:46.200 --> 2:53:50.160]  media cartels and their control over the elections.
[2:53:50.160 --> 2:53:54.720]  Either he's committing political suicide or there's some larger agenda.
[2:53:54.720 --> 2:53:55.720]  I don't understand.
[2:53:55.720 --> 2:53:58.880]  And so people ask, why is Matt dredge Matt at Trump?
[2:53:58.880 --> 2:54:04.280]  Well, because he's abandoned Julian Assange and he's abandoned Roger Stone so far.
[2:54:04.280 --> 2:54:08.520]  And he's abandoned so many other people now they're going after Greenwald.
[2:54:08.520 --> 2:54:14.400]  And that's a dangerous sign to people that Trump either doesn't care or doesn't have
[2:54:14.400 --> 2:54:20.880]  the power to stand up against the persecution of his most ardent, key, seminal, zero patient
[2:54:20.880 --> 2:54:21.880]  supporters.
[2:54:21.880 --> 2:54:24.400]  And this is not a bash at Trump here.
[2:54:24.400 --> 2:54:26.160]  This isn't even defensive of dredge.
[2:54:26.160 --> 2:54:27.760]  I understand why dredge has done this.
[2:54:27.760 --> 2:54:30.960]  I've kept me to do a big report on it, write an article about it because now it's a big
[2:54:30.960 --> 2:54:35.120]  story worldwide that dredges clearly against Trump now.
[2:54:35.120 --> 2:54:39.880]  And I think it's because dredge is a purist and has never really compromised, promoting
[2:54:39.880 --> 2:54:46.880]  our stuff all the time as well, and that he doesn't like Trump becoming what we were fighting,
[2:54:46.880 --> 2:54:50.920]  even if it's in the name of a greater cause, because the lesser of two evils never turns
[2:54:50.920 --> 2:54:51.920]  out that way.
[2:54:51.920 --> 2:54:53.120]  And I think that's why Trump is pissed.
[2:54:53.120 --> 2:54:56.760]  I mean, I think that's why dredge is pissed at Trump.
[2:54:56.760 --> 2:55:01.240]  But regardless, there's so many of these angles to talk about the incredible footage of Bernie
[2:55:01.240 --> 2:55:05.000]  Sanders as a communist, the president saying that, absolutely true.
[2:55:05.000 --> 2:55:07.720]  People say, well, then why are you upset that they're cheating Bernie Sanders?
[2:55:07.720 --> 2:55:10.040]  Well, because we need to have him run right up against Trump.
[2:55:10.040 --> 2:55:11.040]  Trump will defeat him.
[2:55:11.040 --> 2:55:15.640]  We need to repudiate communism and not have it gestate inside of America without being
[2:55:15.640 --> 2:55:17.140]  exposed.
[2:55:17.140 --> 2:55:20.400]  So I say, just get it out in the open and justice be done, but the heavens fall.
[2:55:20.400 --> 2:55:23.680]  But there is just so much going on.
[2:55:23.680 --> 2:55:29.040]  We've also got CNN and Bloomberg running TV ads and commercials saying Trump puts kids
[2:55:29.040 --> 2:55:32.800]  in cages and showing six-year-old Obama footage.
[2:55:32.800 --> 2:55:36.360]  We all know it's a lie that are informed the general public doesn't, but it's so criminal
[2:55:36.360 --> 2:55:37.600]  that they know it's debunked.
[2:55:37.600 --> 2:55:38.600]  They keep doing it.
[2:55:38.600 --> 2:55:44.480]  Meanwhile, J.Lo and Shakira Super Bowl halftime show features kids in cages.
[2:55:44.480 --> 2:55:51.080]  So it's just a total war on reality and there's no end to what they're going to do.
[2:55:51.080 --> 2:55:54.680]  And the Super Bowl, you know, had ads for killing white people because they're closet
[2:55:54.680 --> 2:55:55.680]  Nazis.
[2:55:55.680 --> 2:55:58.480]  This is all an attempt to cause a race war.
[2:55:58.480 --> 2:56:03.360]  And there's a larger globalist plan playing us off against each other at the highest levels.
[2:56:03.360 --> 2:56:11.240]  Meanwhile, we have, again, the incredible news that the Pentagon is studying fully updated
[2:56:11.240 --> 2:56:16.760]  microaggressions detector to catch implicit bias in the workforce, where gadgets like
[2:56:16.760 --> 2:56:20.600]  Amazon and Google are put out or everywhere listening to the troops, if they say things
[2:56:20.600 --> 2:56:22.120]  that aren't right, it's reported back.
[2:56:22.120 --> 2:56:23.120]  That's 1984.
[2:56:23.120 --> 2:56:27.080]  And then you submit to that propaganda and then it's next, oh, don't say mother and
[2:56:27.080 --> 2:56:28.080]  father.
[2:56:28.080 --> 2:56:30.000]  They dial up what is suppressed.
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:32.280]  I mean, we aren't approaching 1984.
[2:56:32.280 --> 2:56:36.520]  We are way, way, way, way, way past it a thousand light years.
[2:56:36.520 --> 2:56:41.800]  And we have to wake up before we're totally destroyed by this and understand the globalists
[2:56:41.800 --> 2:56:46.800]  are just possessed with a absolute desire for total control and power.
[2:56:46.800 --> 2:56:51.000]  And whoever created this coronavirus, it's manufactured.
[2:56:51.000 --> 2:56:52.000]  And it's the perfect.
[2:56:52.000 --> 2:56:56.040]  I mean, I don't want to say Trump did this because I don't think he'd do something like
[2:56:56.040 --> 2:56:57.040]  this.
[2:56:57.040 --> 2:57:00.120]  I mean, maybe it's a complex false flag to blame America down the road.
[2:57:00.120 --> 2:57:12.480]  But the UN, everybody knows that this is a tailored virus that hits Chinese males more
[2:57:12.480 --> 2:57:13.480]  than anybody else.
[2:57:13.480 --> 2:57:14.840]  I mean, that is just unbelievable.
[2:57:14.840 --> 2:57:18.640]  So we're going to go to break here and do five more minutes and get Owen Troyer's take
[2:57:18.640 --> 2:57:19.640]  on all this.
[2:57:19.640 --> 2:57:26.400]  I'll make, I mean, I'll make pay while the sun shines, ladies and gentlemen, I just
[2:57:26.400 --> 2:57:31.640]  want people to understand that we might not be on the air much longer and that the system
[2:57:31.640 --> 2:57:36.000]  has been bombarding us with attacks that are unspeakable, that are just out of control.
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:39.640]  So we'll be right back with the fourth hour, five more minutes, no more Troyer than Paul
[2:57:39.640 --> 2:57:40.640]  Joseph Watson.
[2:57:40.640 --> 2:57:56.840]  Take so
[2:57:56.840 --> 2:58:01.120]  products, where we've gone out and researched what is the best, what gives people the best
[2:58:01.120 --> 2:58:05.840]  results, we either private label it or we develop our own with top developers.
[2:58:05.840 --> 2:58:10.600]  And folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus.
[2:58:10.600 --> 2:58:13.600]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[2:58:13.600 --> 2:58:14.600]  It's incredible.
[2:58:14.600 --> 2:58:18.640]  So do yourself a favor, try out the products if you've been on the fence.
[2:58:18.640 --> 2:58:22.720]  You can't lose, except if you don't take action, because when you buy the products,
[2:58:22.720 --> 2:58:27.280]  you're funding the operation that is always delivering thanks to your support and God's
[2:58:27.280 --> 2:58:28.680]  grace and our action.
[2:58:28.680 --> 2:58:30.520]  But you need these products.
[2:58:30.520 --> 2:58:33.440]  That's the real reason you want to get them, is because they're amazing.
[2:58:33.440 --> 2:58:37.560]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[2:58:37.560 --> 2:58:41.240]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO, instead of imploding.
[2:58:41.240 --> 2:58:45.160]  We're fighting to win and we are winning, thanks to you.
[2:58:45.160 --> 2:58:48.360]  We've got three big sales going right now.
[2:58:48.360 --> 2:58:50.720]  And one of them has to end within a week.
[2:58:50.720 --> 2:58:56.360]  And that's ultimate fish oil for 33% off.
[2:58:56.360 --> 2:58:57.360]  It's amazing.
[2:58:57.360 --> 2:58:58.840]  Go check it out for yourself.
[2:58:58.840 --> 2:59:05.080]  Then we've got back in stock X2, our best-selling deep earth crystals iodine, the good halogen
[2:59:05.080 --> 2:59:07.160]  that is the building block to everything in the body.
[2:59:07.160 --> 2:59:09.320]  And I just can't tell you enough how important it is.
[2:59:09.320 --> 2:59:13.200]  The UN admits two billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never
[2:59:13.200 --> 2:59:14.200]  got enough iodine.
[2:59:14.200 --> 2:59:19.400]  So just check it out for yourself, 40% off, M4store.com and it funds the M4.
[2:59:19.400 --> 2:59:26.320]  And then vitamin D3 with vitamin K that fuses it together, super high quality, winter sun.
[2:59:26.320 --> 2:59:28.280]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[2:59:28.280 --> 2:59:30.880]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[2:59:30.880 --> 2:59:32.080]  That's why people get so sick.
[2:59:32.080 --> 2:59:33.080]  That's the main reason.
[2:59:33.080 --> 2:59:35.960]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue, get higher absorption.
[2:59:35.960 --> 2:59:36.960]  It's amazing.
[2:59:36.960 --> 2:59:41.360]  All three of these are on sale, but only for a limited time at M4store.com.
[2:59:41.360 --> 2:59:48.080]  Protect yourself and fund the M4, 360 win.
[2:59:48.080 --> 2:59:55.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:55.080 --> 3:00:09.080]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Alex Jones show final segment.
[3:00:09.080 --> 3:00:11.840]  For me, Owen Schreuer, I'm going to play a clip.
[3:00:11.840 --> 3:00:15.520]  Let me just pound through the rest of these headlines before I get to that.
[3:00:15.520 --> 3:00:22.400]  As vault seven trial begins, Joshua Schulte's attorneys will argue he's a whistleblower.
[3:00:22.400 --> 3:00:31.440]  Well, the important thing about this is the vault seven leaks from WikiLeaks are so powerful
[3:00:31.440 --> 3:00:34.800]  confirming what we already knew and assumed was going on.
[3:00:34.800 --> 3:00:39.000]  Yes, the government can tap into anything and everything.
[3:00:39.000 --> 3:00:42.240]  Yes, you're being spied on 24 seven.
[3:00:42.240 --> 3:00:46.040]  Yes, it's all being plugged into a database.
[3:00:46.040 --> 3:00:48.480]  There is no privacy anymore.
[3:00:48.480 --> 3:00:53.480]  Now, just imagine if the wrong hands got on that power.
[3:00:53.480 --> 3:00:58.240]  Oh, wait, they already did.
[3:00:58.240 --> 3:01:01.000]  Clapper Brennan, Colmy Obama.
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:06.520]  Yeah, they were abusing that to the hill and they still do to this day.
[3:01:06.520 --> 3:01:09.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, they still do to this day.
[3:01:09.680 --> 3:01:14.200]  So it's beyond just your phone constantly listening for marketing purposes.
[3:01:14.200 --> 3:01:21.120]  It's corrupt government officials and beyond tapping into whoever phone they want, whether
[3:01:21.120 --> 3:01:25.480]  they want to spy on their political opposition like the Obama administration did, or if they
[3:01:25.480 --> 3:01:29.600]  just want to, I don't know, blackmail their wife or spy on their wife.
[3:01:29.600 --> 3:01:31.160]  That goes on too.
[3:01:31.160 --> 3:01:35.680]  And that was all exposed by WikiLeaks, the vault seven release.
[3:01:35.680 --> 3:01:41.160]  And like Alex said, you know, I mean, Julian Assange has been totally abandoned.
[3:01:41.160 --> 3:01:43.000]  I mean, the guy's rotting in a prison cell.
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:46.080]  This guy should be a world hero.
[3:01:46.080 --> 3:01:50.560]  Julian Assange should be uplifted as one of the greatest journalists in the history of
[3:01:50.560 --> 3:01:51.720]  the world.
[3:01:51.720 --> 3:01:55.720]  You should cancel the Pulitzer Prize and call it the Assange Award, but he's been thrown
[3:01:55.720 --> 3:01:59.160]  under the bus by the Trump administration and he rots in a prison cell.
[3:01:59.160 --> 3:02:00.160]  That's what you get.
[3:02:00.160 --> 3:02:02.800]  But this is Satan's world.
[3:02:02.800 --> 3:02:03.800]  Satan's minions run it.
[3:02:03.800 --> 3:02:09.480]  So, of course, Julian Assange rot in a prison cell, a world hero.
[3:02:09.480 --> 3:02:12.080]  Scientists use flickering light to fight Alzheimer's.
[3:02:12.080 --> 3:02:15.120]  That story is at infowars.com.
[3:02:15.120 --> 3:02:19.680]  But imagine what they do with the flicker rates on the TV to brainwash people, folks.
[3:02:19.680 --> 3:02:21.720]  And I've studied this pretty deeply.
[3:02:21.720 --> 3:02:28.480]  I won't get into all of it now, but there's a reason why the TV was delayed upon release
[3:02:28.480 --> 3:02:36.600]  during World War I because, or excuse me, during World War II, because they were testing
[3:02:36.600 --> 3:02:44.600]  flicker rates on monkeys and other primates and humans to see what were the most powerful
[3:02:44.600 --> 3:02:46.840]  flicker rates to literally brainwash you.
[3:02:46.840 --> 3:02:47.840]  The TV was invented.
[3:02:47.840 --> 3:02:49.600]  All of a sudden, it just kind of paused.
[3:02:49.600 --> 3:02:50.600]  Nobody knew what happened.
[3:02:50.600 --> 3:02:53.640]  They were testing it in government facilities to see how they could use it to brainwash
[3:02:53.640 --> 3:02:54.640]  you.
[3:02:54.640 --> 3:02:56.800]  And then once they had it all figured out, they released it.
[3:02:56.800 --> 3:03:04.160]  And again, remember, coronavirus expert, Dr. Francis Boyle will be on the Alex Jones
[3:03:04.160 --> 3:03:06.080]  show tomorrow.
[3:03:06.080 --> 3:03:08.080]  Don't miss that.
[3:03:08.080 --> 3:03:12.440]  And again, folks, what's coming out about the coronavirus and what China's doing is
[3:03:12.440 --> 3:03:13.720]  really just crazy.
[3:03:13.720 --> 3:03:18.640]  By the way, even the Daily Beast is wondering, what the hell is China doing on the dark side
[3:03:18.640 --> 3:03:20.840]  of the moon?
[3:03:20.840 --> 3:03:22.520]  Maybe making the next coronavirus.
[3:03:22.520 --> 3:03:23.520]  All right.
[3:03:23.520 --> 3:03:24.680]  Do we have time?
[3:03:24.680 --> 3:03:27.320]  Let's go to this Pete Buttigieg voter.
[3:03:27.320 --> 3:03:29.840]  A lady didn't know Pete was gay.
[3:03:29.840 --> 3:03:32.440]  Now wants to change her vote once she found out.
[3:03:32.440 --> 3:03:33.440]  Go ahead.
[3:03:33.440 --> 3:03:36.440]  Are you saying that he has the same sex partner?
[3:03:36.440 --> 3:03:37.440]  He?
[3:03:37.440 --> 3:03:38.440]  Yes.
[3:03:38.440 --> 3:03:39.440]  Yes.
[3:03:39.440 --> 3:03:40.440]  Are you kidding?
[3:03:40.440 --> 3:03:41.440]  He's married to him, yes.
[3:03:41.440 --> 3:03:42.440]  Then I don't want anybody like that to find out.
[3:03:42.440 --> 3:03:43.440]  So can I have my car back?
[3:03:43.440 --> 3:03:44.440]  I don't know.
[3:03:44.440 --> 3:03:45.440]  Yes, I did.
[3:03:45.440 --> 3:03:46.440]  We can go ask.
[3:03:46.440 --> 3:03:55.440]  I never knew that.
[3:03:55.440 --> 3:03:58.440]  Well, it's so weird.
[3:03:58.440 --> 3:04:02.440]  The whole point of it is though, he's a human being, right?
[3:04:02.440 --> 3:04:07.120]  Just like human being, and it shouldn't really matter.
[3:04:07.120 --> 3:04:08.120]  That's what...
[3:04:08.120 --> 3:04:09.120]  Well, he better read the Bible.
[3:04:09.120 --> 3:04:10.120]  He does.
[3:04:10.120 --> 3:04:15.520]  And he says that God doesn't choose a political party, because why does it say in the Bible
[3:04:15.520 --> 3:04:17.840]  that a man should marry a woman then?
[3:04:17.840 --> 3:04:21.840]  Well, I totally respect your viewpoint on this.
[3:04:21.840 --> 3:04:23.840]  I so totally do.
[3:04:23.840 --> 3:04:26.840]  But I think that we were not around in the past.
[3:04:26.840 --> 3:04:27.840]  How come this has never been around before?
[3:04:27.840 --> 3:04:30.840]  You think we weren't around when the Bible was written down in the video?
[3:04:30.840 --> 3:04:31.840]  Wow.
[3:04:31.840 --> 3:04:32.840]  What a genius she is.
[3:04:32.840 --> 3:04:33.840]  I never heard it.
[3:04:33.840 --> 3:04:41.160]  You know, look, I actually came face to face with these people when I was in Iowa during
[3:04:41.160 --> 3:04:42.640]  the presidential debate.
[3:04:42.640 --> 3:04:44.640]  Pete actually felt like the most human out of all of them.
[3:04:44.640 --> 3:04:46.640]  None of them felt human except Pete.
[3:04:46.640 --> 3:04:51.240]  And he really doesn't rub his homosexuality like that hard on everybody else, but people
[3:04:51.240 --> 3:04:52.920]  don't like it.
[3:04:52.920 --> 3:04:55.880]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful.
[3:04:55.880 --> 3:04:59.440]  No matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, we're all feeling the strain from

[3:05:52.480 --> 3:06:12.680]  We're live and it seems that the list of people who don't want to see the Iowa caucus primary
[3:06:12.680 --> 3:06:16.040]  results revealed to the public is growing.
[3:06:16.040 --> 3:06:20.640]  Biden campaign hints that it may seek core order to stop partial wealth release of caucus
[3:06:20.640 --> 3:06:22.640]  vote tallies.
[3:06:22.640 --> 3:06:26.080]  Could that be anything to do with the fact that the internal polling suggests that he
[3:06:26.080 --> 3:06:31.280]  came fifth and that could completely sink the momentum of his campaign?
[3:06:31.280 --> 3:06:33.280]  Gee, I wonder.
[3:06:33.280 --> 3:06:37.920]  Of course, we've got videos coming out and I'll get to this in a minute where they decide
[3:06:37.920 --> 3:06:43.680]  the delegates when it's a tie by literally having high school kids flip a coin in school
[3:06:43.680 --> 3:06:45.240]  gym masiums.
[3:06:45.240 --> 3:06:50.560]  That's the level of sophistication that the Democrats are running with this Iowa caucus.
[3:06:50.560 --> 3:06:56.560]  Of course, we've had this bizarre coding issue with people not being able to learn to code
[3:06:56.560 --> 3:07:03.040]  apparently with the shadow app headline here out of Breitbart, nine things to know about
[3:07:03.040 --> 3:07:06.000]  the app at the center of the Iowa caucus fiasco.
[3:07:06.000 --> 3:07:09.960]  Of course, now they're saying, oh, no, it wasn't the app that was to blame, despite
[3:07:09.960 --> 3:07:12.400]  admitting that it was earlier.
[3:07:12.400 --> 3:07:14.520]  It's called shadow Inc.
[3:07:14.520 --> 3:07:18.680]  Some people are saying that some of the boomers in the polling stations didn't know how to
[3:07:18.680 --> 3:07:23.760]  use smartphones, so that could have been one of the reasons.
[3:07:23.760 --> 3:07:26.040]  Shadow Inc. says, what is shadow?
[3:07:26.040 --> 3:07:29.680]  Shadow Inc. is the democratic firm that reportedly built the app.
[3:07:29.680 --> 3:07:33.720]  The firm says on its official site that its mission is to build political power for the
[3:07:33.720 --> 3:07:38.080]  progressive movement by developing affordable and easy to use tools.
[3:07:38.080 --> 3:07:45.440]  By the way, this app is owned by a parent company called Acronym and the owner of that
[3:07:45.440 --> 3:07:52.360]  company is apparently a big Pete Booty judge supporter, despite denying it, even though
[3:07:52.360 --> 3:07:54.720]  that was literally on their website.
[3:07:54.720 --> 3:07:59.720]  The company was launched in 2019 by Acronym, a democratic nonprofit group who was affiliated
[3:07:59.720 --> 3:08:04.960]  political action committee to support progressive candidates across the country, though Acronym
[3:08:04.960 --> 3:08:12.360]  is a democratic operation that received big funding from left-leaning Silicon Valley investors.
[3:08:12.360 --> 3:08:17.000]  During Monday's debacle, Acronym has been distancing itself from shadow, saying in
[3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:23.640]  a statement, it was only an investor, despite on its official website, saying that it launched
[3:08:23.640 --> 3:08:25.760]  shadow in 2019.
[3:08:25.760 --> 3:08:29.840]  So they're probably busy scrubbing the fact that they admitted to launching this company
[3:08:29.840 --> 3:08:34.400]  behind the app, now claiming they were only an investor.
[3:08:34.400 --> 3:08:40.960]  And shadowing CEO Gerard Nimira worked on Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign,
[3:08:40.960 --> 3:08:43.680]  as did three of the high-ranking company officers.
[3:08:43.680 --> 3:08:45.160]  How interesting.
[3:08:45.160 --> 3:08:48.520]  Nimira's LinkedIn profile shows he worked for Hillary for America for a little more
[3:08:48.520 --> 3:08:52.320]  than a year in previous capacities, including product director.
[3:08:52.320 --> 3:08:57.440]  Again, these are the people behind the app that's being blamed for the lack of results
[3:08:57.440 --> 3:08:59.720]  out of Iowa last night.
[3:08:59.720 --> 3:09:05.880]  Shadows, product manager Anna Rao, Chief Technology Officer Krista Davis and Chief Operating Officer
[3:09:05.880 --> 3:09:10.880]  James Hickey also worked on Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[3:09:10.880 --> 3:09:16.200]  Bobby Mook, Hillary Clinton's former campaign manager, has distanced himself and denied
[3:09:16.200 --> 3:09:18.320]  involvement in developing the software.
[3:09:18.320 --> 3:09:25.800]  And of course, this all led to the hashtag, Mayor Cheat Trending on Twitter, which a lot
[3:09:25.800 --> 3:09:29.200]  of leftists immediately claim was the work of Russian bots.
[3:09:29.200 --> 3:09:31.480]  We're going to get into that.
[3:09:31.480 --> 3:09:36.440]  But Booty Judges' campaign reportedly paid shadow more than $42,000 last year for software,
[3:09:36.440 --> 3:09:42.160]  though it remains unclear if shadow showed favoritism towards his campaign in any way.
[3:09:42.160 --> 3:09:49.160]  The Democratic Party paid shadow $63,000 in two installments, and the Nevada State Democratic
[3:09:49.160 --> 3:09:52.000]  Party paid $58,000 to shadow in August.
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:58.120]  And the question remains, is Nevada going to use this same app in their upcoming primary,
[3:09:58.120 --> 3:10:02.880]  given the absolute bedlam that it seems to have caused in Iowa?
[3:10:02.880 --> 3:10:08.480]  So that goes on to detail the origins of this app, and of course, it led to Mayor Cheat
[3:10:08.480 --> 3:10:13.400]  Trending on Twitter, headline here out in Summit News, Mayor Cheat Pete Booty Judge
[3:10:13.400 --> 3:10:18.160]  Accords Accused of Trying to Steal Iowa Caucus.
[3:10:18.160 --> 3:10:20.160]  Of course, they blamed a reporting issue now.
[3:10:20.160 --> 3:10:21.400]  They're not saying it's the app.
[3:10:21.400 --> 3:10:26.720]  But Pete Booty Judge, despite no results having been declared, came out almost immediately
[3:10:26.720 --> 3:10:30.400]  and said, by all indication, this is what he said, quote, by all indications, we're
[3:10:30.400 --> 3:10:36.560]  going on to New Hampshire victorious tonight, and improbable hope became an undeniable reality
[3:10:36.560 --> 3:10:43.120]  when no results were even made public, and when his own campaign's internal polling numbers
[3:10:43.120 --> 3:10:48.360]  matched those of Bernie Sanders and showed that Sanders won.
[3:10:48.360 --> 3:10:55.560]  Last time I saw, Pete Booty Judge was on about 24% and Sanders was on 29%.
[3:10:55.560 --> 3:10:58.080]  So Sanders won.
[3:10:58.080 --> 3:11:01.600]  Now they're saying, well, we never know, we don't even know when we're going to get these
[3:11:01.600 --> 3:11:02.600]  results.
[3:11:02.600 --> 3:11:07.960]  Acronim founder, this is the owner of the Shadow app, Tara McGowan, is a Booty Judge supporter
[3:11:07.960 --> 3:11:14.560]  and is married to one of his advisors, who by the way, works in a technical capacity,
[3:11:14.560 --> 3:11:16.800]  just a coincidence.
[3:11:16.800 --> 3:11:20.360]  The Conservative Treehouse blog says the botched results could have been a deliberate ploy
[3:11:20.360 --> 3:11:26.480]  to hide Joe Biden's collapse and mask the less than enthusiastic voter turnout.
[3:11:26.480 --> 3:11:35.040]  After the Moody's analytics survey analysis, which found that if there's a less than
[3:11:35.040 --> 3:11:41.040]  expected turnout, if there's a less than enthusiastic turnout in the general election, Trump will
[3:11:41.040 --> 3:11:42.040]  easily win.
[3:11:42.040 --> 3:11:47.760]  There has to be a huge turnout for Trump to be challenged by any of these pathetic democratic
[3:11:47.760 --> 3:11:52.800]  candidates, despite Trump, of course, having his own problems, now shot to an all time
[3:11:52.800 --> 3:11:56.400]  high in approval ratings in the latest Gallup poll.
[3:11:56.400 --> 3:12:00.040]  That tells you everything you need to know about the quality of this democratic field.
[3:12:00.040 --> 3:12:06.560]  But the Conservative Treehouse blog states, and this was before Biden's campaign indicated
[3:12:06.560 --> 3:12:10.800]  that they're going to seek core injunction to prevent these results from coming out.
[3:12:10.800 --> 3:12:12.560]  Gee, I wonder why.
[3:12:12.560 --> 3:12:17.280]  They said, quote, from the DNC club's perspective, there were three strategic needs surrounding
[3:12:17.280 --> 3:12:23.560]  the Iowa caucuses, one, hide the collapse of Joe Biden, two, diminish the win by Bernie
[3:12:23.560 --> 3:12:29.600]  Sanders, and three, cover up a less than enthusiastic voter turnout, given the nature of very public
[3:12:29.600 --> 3:12:30.600]  primary races.
[3:12:30.600 --> 3:12:35.720]  This three pronged challenge seemed almost impossible, almost.
[3:12:35.720 --> 3:12:38.560]  So that's what's going on with that.
[3:12:38.560 --> 3:12:43.440]  Now we have this headline out of red state, Biden campaign hinted that it may seek core
[3:12:43.440 --> 3:12:48.200]  order to stop partial release of caucus vote tallies.
[3:12:48.200 --> 3:12:51.480]  Goes on to say, we think we have a pretty good idea on the actual results, both the
[3:12:51.480 --> 3:12:56.840]  Sanders and Booty Judge camps are circulating the same number, and what do those numbers
[3:12:56.840 --> 3:12:57.840]  show?
[3:12:57.840 --> 3:13:08.800]  They show Bernie Sanders on 29.6%, Booty Judge on 24.5%, and Joe Biden on just 12%.
[3:13:08.800 --> 3:13:14.040]  That's Biden finishing fifth, a fifth place finish in Iowa, and looking ahead to New
[3:13:14.040 --> 3:13:19.640]  Hampshire where Sanders will beat him, and Nevada where he's not terribly strong means
[3:13:19.640 --> 3:13:23.480]  that Joe Biden is finished.
[3:13:23.480 --> 3:13:24.480]  And what do you know?
[3:13:24.480 --> 3:13:29.000]  This circulated within the past couple of hours, CNN John King reports that the Biden
[3:13:29.000 --> 3:13:34.440]  campaign may seek a court injunction to halt this afternoon's release of the Iowa caucus
[3:13:34.440 --> 3:13:35.760]  results.
[3:13:35.760 --> 3:13:40.440]  While the Iowa results are released, if they ever will be released, Biden's campaign is
[3:13:40.440 --> 3:13:49.040]  questioning the integrity of the results because, of course, they show him in fifth.
[3:13:49.040 --> 3:13:53.880]  And then we have Matt Gaetz going on Fox News, headline out of Breitbart Gaetz, if Biden
[3:13:53.880 --> 3:13:57.080]  had won Iowa, we probably would have some results.
[3:13:57.080 --> 3:14:02.680]  During the Fox News Channel's 2020 Iowa caucus coverage, Matt Gaetz said that if 2020 Democratic
[3:14:02.680 --> 3:14:07.160]  presidential candidate and former VP Joe Biden had won the Iowa caucuses, quote, we
[3:14:07.160 --> 3:14:10.400]  probably would have some results right now.
[3:14:10.400 --> 3:14:14.920]  Now they're trying to file a court order to prevent those results coming out.
[3:14:14.920 --> 3:14:22.080]  Then we have this, again, out of Summit News, dubious coin flips hand Booty Judge delegates
[3:14:22.080 --> 3:14:23.680]  in Iowa.
[3:14:23.680 --> 3:14:29.120]  This is nothing new, but they literally have like high school students in school gymnasiums
[3:14:29.120 --> 3:14:32.760]  flipping a coin to decide who gets delegates that are tied.
[3:14:32.760 --> 3:14:37.640]  And if you watch the video in this article, this kid has never flipped a coin before in
[3:14:37.640 --> 3:14:42.400]  his life, but he's being given the power to decide who gets the delegates.
[3:14:42.400 --> 3:14:47.200]  Article reads with the South Bend Mayor already being accused of cheating, but that's Russia,
[3:14:47.200 --> 3:14:50.160]  as we'll get onto in a minute, according to some idiots.
[3:14:50.160 --> 3:14:55.760]  Dubious coin flips help hand Pete Booty Judge more delegates in Iowa.
[3:14:55.760 --> 3:15:00.480]  And this is the video embedded in the article, it shows Booty Judge winning the last delegate
[3:15:00.480 --> 3:15:06.120]  in an Iowa caucus precinct via a coin flip that doesn't really look like it was done
[3:15:06.120 --> 3:15:07.120]  properly.
[3:15:07.120 --> 3:15:09.440]  You can see the video right here.
[3:15:09.440 --> 3:15:13.520]  This kid who flips the coin appears to catch you awkwardly, takes a peek, then flips the
[3:15:13.520 --> 3:15:19.880]  coin over before immediately declaring heads to give Booty Judge the delegate.
[3:15:19.880 --> 3:15:23.640]  E. Miles Chong tweeted the video with a comment, how to rig a coin toss.
[3:15:23.640 --> 3:15:28.480]  There's another video of the same thing that's happened across Iowa last night.
[3:15:28.480 --> 3:15:33.920]  Not a very scientific method, I think you will agree.
[3:15:33.920 --> 3:15:38.960]  But then on the flip side, then we have a bunch of Booty Judge supporters claiming that
[3:15:38.960 --> 3:15:46.000]  the hashtags that were trending on Twitter were created, maintained and popularized by
[3:15:46.000 --> 3:15:47.000]  Russian bots.
[3:15:47.000 --> 3:15:50.360]  Yes, Russian derangement syndrome is still running strong.
[3:15:50.360 --> 3:15:51.360]  Don't go away.
[3:15:51.360 --> 3:15:52.360]  We'll be right back.
[3:15:52.360 --> 3:15:56.040]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla, I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize
[3:15:56.040 --> 3:15:57.160]  my mother's house.
[3:15:57.160 --> 3:15:58.680]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:15:58.680 --> 3:16:01.640]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:16:01.640 --> 3:16:04.920]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[3:16:04.920 --> 3:16:07.160]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:16:07.160 --> 3:16:08.480]  I can help you too.
[3:16:08.480 --> 3:16:11.480]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[3:16:21.560 --> 3:16:26.960]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[3:16:26.960 --> 3:16:27.960]  the world.
[3:16:27.960 --> 3:16:30.960]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[3:16:30.960 --> 3:16:36.920]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[3:16:36.920 --> 3:16:40.720]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[3:16:40.720 --> 3:16:41.720]  Was there ever a vote?
[3:16:41.720 --> 3:16:43.280]  Who do we fight for?
[3:16:43.280 --> 3:16:49.800]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunne, available
[3:16:49.800 --> 3:16:51.920]  at Amazon Books.
[3:16:51.920 --> 3:16:54.960]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?

[3:19:18.760 --> 3:19:24.200]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's
[3:19:24.200 --> 3:19:29.800]  the bad halogen and people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful
[3:19:29.800 --> 3:19:36.680]  that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago, I started taking true iodine, atomic

[3:19:56.120 --> 3:20:17.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:17.800 --> 3:20:24.640]  So we have this bizarre shadowy app which is called literally shadow ink owned by a
[3:20:24.640 --> 3:20:31.200]  Pete Buttigieg supporter, staffed by a bunch of Hillary Clinton people and now they're
[3:20:31.200 --> 3:20:33.080]  not even going to give us the public results.
[3:20:33.080 --> 3:20:37.280]  We've got Joe Biden who according to internal polling was down in fifth.
[3:20:37.280 --> 3:20:42.000]  This could have completely destroyed the momentum of his campaign if the results have been released.
[3:20:42.000 --> 3:20:43.280]  They haven't been released yet.
[3:20:43.280 --> 3:20:48.680]  We've got high school kids flipping coins in school gymnasiums to decide delegates going
[3:20:48.680 --> 3:20:51.640]  to Pete Buttigieg.
[3:20:51.640 --> 3:20:56.000]  And we have this, of course, who is to blame for all this?
[3:20:56.000 --> 3:21:01.480]  Who is to blame for the snafu with the voting tallies, all the shadowy activity behind the
[3:21:01.480 --> 3:21:02.800]  scenes down there in Iowa?
[3:21:02.800 --> 3:21:06.200]  Well, of course, it must be Russia.
[3:21:06.200 --> 3:21:12.200]  Leftist blame Russian box for fallout from Iowa caucus shambles.
[3:21:12.200 --> 3:21:16.880]  Now this is funny because it was already happening before Trump tweeted about this.
[3:21:16.880 --> 3:21:19.200]  Trump tweeted this afternoon.
[3:21:19.200 --> 3:21:23.840]  Before this morning, American time, when will the Democrats stop blaming Russia, Russia,
[3:21:23.840 --> 3:21:28.120]  Russia instead of their own incompetence for the voting disaster that just happened in
[3:21:28.120 --> 3:21:29.880]  the great state of Iowa?
[3:21:29.880 --> 3:21:37.480]  While they were already doing so hours before Trump posted that tweet article, some leftists
[3:21:37.480 --> 3:21:42.000]  of blaming Russian propaganda accounts for the embarrassing fallout from the Iowa caucus
[3:21:42.000 --> 3:21:47.040]  fulfilling a prediction by President Trump that they would do precisely that the results
[3:21:47.040 --> 3:21:51.760]  from last night's caucus were delayed due to a reporting issue related to an app called
[3:21:51.760 --> 3:21:56.200]  shadow, the owner of which Torum Gowan is a mayor, Pete Buttigieg supporter, and is
[3:21:56.200 --> 3:21:58.720]  married to one of his advisers.
[3:21:58.720 --> 3:22:03.760]  So this, of course, prompted the hashtag mayor cheat to trend on Twitter.
[3:22:03.760 --> 3:22:08.080]  And that in turn prompted numerous hysterical Buttigieg supporters to claim the hashtag
[3:22:08.080 --> 3:22:11.760]  was a creation of Russian controlled box.
[3:22:11.760 --> 3:22:16.040]  Like, do these people not even use Twitter from day to day?
[3:22:16.040 --> 3:22:20.680]  You can click on the hashtags and you can see a bunch of people who are real people,
[3:22:20.680 --> 3:22:21.680]  not bots.
[3:22:21.680 --> 3:22:22.680]  They have names.
[3:22:22.680 --> 3:22:23.680]  They have faces.
[3:22:23.680 --> 3:22:27.480]  You've seen them tweeting for months for years beforehand, talking about this, but now it
[3:22:27.480 --> 3:22:30.200]  must be Russian bots.
[3:22:30.200 --> 3:22:36.760]  One of them said, quote, David Slak, who is a drama writer, which is very appropriate.
[3:22:36.760 --> 3:22:41.960]  While I can't yet prove it, I feel safe in saying, so he's got no proof, but he feels
[3:22:41.960 --> 3:22:49.200]  safe in saying it, that both Bernie one, hashtag Bernie one and mayor cheat are trending because
[3:22:49.200 --> 3:22:51.920]  Russian propaganda accounts are amplifying them.
[3:22:51.920 --> 3:22:53.960]  Putin's goal is to divide us.
[3:22:53.960 --> 3:22:58.520]  Instead, let's stand together, elect Democrats and sanction his ass out of office.
[3:22:58.520 --> 3:23:03.280]  Now Twitter has said it will crack down and ban people for putting out disinformation related
[3:23:03.280 --> 3:23:07.600]  to the election, which of course is completely vague and could mean anything.
[3:23:07.600 --> 3:23:09.400]  That's disinformation.
[3:23:09.400 --> 3:23:15.080]  He admits he's got no proof for it, but then goes ahead, this verified liberal and claims
[3:23:15.080 --> 3:23:16.080]  it anyway.
[3:23:16.080 --> 3:23:18.440]  And that was the source.
[3:23:18.440 --> 3:23:20.440]  I'm looking at this tweet right now.
[3:23:20.440 --> 3:23:24.000]  It's got 15,000 interactions.
[3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:27.640]  That was the source for this new conspiracy theory that it was Russia that was behind
[3:23:27.640 --> 3:23:29.360]  all this.
[3:23:29.360 --> 3:23:34.960]  Another person said, Miss Krasenstein, which is obviously those Krasenstein brothers that
[3:23:34.960 --> 3:23:39.880]  got banned by Twitter, but are now using another account, also a violation of Twitter rules,
[3:23:39.880 --> 3:23:41.680]  but nothing happens to them.
[3:23:41.680 --> 3:23:46.400]  If you are legitimately tweeting the mayor cheat hashtag, then you are either A, a Russian
[3:23:46.400 --> 3:23:51.280]  operative, B, a GOP operative, or a useful idiot playing right into Trump, Russia's strategy
[3:23:51.280 --> 3:23:53.960]  of dividing the Democratic Party.
[3:23:53.960 --> 3:23:57.680]  Another person said, quote, morons, mayor cheat is trending because Russia is manipulating
[3:23:57.680 --> 3:23:58.680]  you idiots.
[3:23:58.680 --> 3:23:59.680]  F all this.
[3:23:59.680 --> 3:24:01.880]  How are Americans this effing stupid?
[3:24:01.880 --> 3:24:05.200]  Another person said, mayor cheat, Russia trolls are starting this, and morons are making
[3:24:05.200 --> 3:24:07.640]  this trend stop.
[3:24:07.640 --> 3:24:11.400]  Of course, absolutely no evidence that bots were behind it.
[3:24:11.400 --> 3:24:16.800]  You go on the hashtag, it's all either verified people, it's Bernie Sanders supporters, whoever
[3:24:16.800 --> 3:24:23.040]  it is, it's not Russian bots, but apparently this is all orchestrated from the Kremlin.
[3:24:23.040 --> 3:24:28.280]  So that was their coping mechanism when people pointed out that this app is literally owned
[3:24:28.280 --> 3:24:33.280]  by somebody who is married to someone within Pete Buttigieg's campaign, and staffed by
[3:24:33.280 --> 3:24:37.640]  a bunch of Hillary Clinton, sick of fans.
[3:24:37.640 --> 3:24:42.560]  So that's what's going on with the latest with the Iowa caucus again, Bernie Sanders
[3:24:42.560 --> 3:24:46.720]  campaign has come out and said they'll file a court injunction to prevent the results
[3:24:46.720 --> 3:24:47.720]  from being released.
[3:24:47.720 --> 3:24:51.680]  I wonder if that has anything to do with the fact that the results from the internal polling
[3:24:51.680 --> 3:24:58.520]  show that he came in fifth, and that that could mean his campaign is completely finished.
[3:24:58.520 --> 3:25:04.160]  Moving on though, of course, this Iowa caucus debacle has knocked coronavirus out the headlines
[3:25:04.160 --> 3:25:08.000]  at least the top of the headlines temporarily.
[3:25:08.000 --> 3:25:12.480]  Article here from summit news report woman in China shot dead for attempting to break
[3:25:12.480 --> 3:25:15.440]  through coronavirus roadblock.
[3:25:15.440 --> 3:25:21.160]  Now as we've heard from within China, they're basically saying that if you deliberately
[3:25:21.160 --> 3:25:28.080]  try to infect anyone else with coronavirus, you will face the death penalty.
[3:25:28.080 --> 3:25:32.480]  It appears that this unfortunate woman faced an immediate death penalty.
[3:25:32.480 --> 3:25:36.520]  The video out of China proposed to show a woman who is shot dead by authorities for
[3:25:36.520 --> 3:25:40.200]  attempting to break through a coronavirus roadblock.
[3:25:40.200 --> 3:25:46.520]  The clip posted by Jennifer Zeng is captioned at Wuzhutang Huanmei County in Hubei.
[3:25:46.520 --> 3:25:49.840]  A woman was said to have shot dead after she attempted to break the blockade to help to
[3:25:49.840 --> 3:25:52.080]  contain coronavirus.
[3:25:52.080 --> 3:25:56.800]  Clip shows the woman who had apparently been shot in the head, laying on the floor.
[3:25:56.800 --> 3:25:58.860]  Another individual is crying over her dead body.
[3:25:58.860 --> 3:26:00.960]  People can be heard screaming, shouting in the background.
[3:26:00.960 --> 3:26:05.000]  Several police vehicles are parked nearby.
[3:26:05.000 --> 3:26:06.720]  Absolute bedlam in China.
[3:26:06.720 --> 3:26:12.840]  They don't have enough testing kits to even figure out who's got coronavirus or not.
[3:26:12.840 --> 3:26:16.280]  They have doctors diagnosing people with pneumonia.
[3:26:16.280 --> 3:26:20.920]  So the official stats on the amount of people infected, the amount of people dead, are obviously
[3:26:20.920 --> 3:26:23.600]  going to be below what we're being told officially.
[3:26:23.600 --> 3:26:27.280]  But then again, if you even question that, then you can get banned off social media as
[3:26:27.280 --> 3:26:28.280]  well now.
[3:26:28.280 --> 3:26:32.800]  They're literally following the same approach as the communist Chinese government in censoring
[3:26:32.800 --> 3:26:35.960]  information about this outbreak.
[3:26:35.960 --> 3:26:39.760]  But this Jennifer Zeng posted other videos which are in this article, which again illustrate
[3:26:39.760 --> 3:26:43.760]  the absolute bedlam that's going on in some parts of China.
[3:26:43.760 --> 3:26:47.920]  Another video shows a coronavirus patient being forcibly bundled into a van as he tries
[3:26:47.920 --> 3:26:48.920]  to resist.
[3:26:48.920 --> 3:26:51.640]  You can see that right there.
[3:26:51.640 --> 3:26:55.520]  Another clip features a doctor saying the crematorium is so overwhelmed, dead bodies
[3:26:55.520 --> 3:26:59.080]  are being held at the hospital, which has become like a, quote, mortuary.
[3:26:59.080 --> 3:27:04.320]  She also posted a video of victims in body bags lined up waiting for incineration at
[3:27:04.320 --> 3:27:06.920]  crematory in Wuhan.
[3:27:06.920 --> 3:27:13.320]  And again, that's telling us 20,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, 427 fatalities.
[3:27:13.320 --> 3:27:22.280]  There are literally 465 people who came from China into the UK and have now just gone missing.
[3:27:22.280 --> 3:27:23.280]  Nobody knows where they are.
[3:27:23.280 --> 3:27:28.880]  Nobody can track them down, so I'm sure that's going to be great for public health.
[3:27:28.880 --> 3:27:34.920]  But according to the WHO, headline WHO demands countries not impose travel restrictions to
[3:27:34.920 --> 3:27:37.120]  avoid fear and stigma.
[3:27:37.120 --> 3:27:43.080]  The cherished sanctity of mass travel and mass migration must not be challenged.
[3:27:43.080 --> 3:27:47.880]  Again, people's feelings might get hurt if you start to profile them.
[3:27:47.880 --> 3:27:52.440]  So that apparently is more important than stopping a potential global pandemic.
[3:27:52.440 --> 3:27:57.320]  The World Health Organization has again warned countries against imposing travel restrictions
[3:27:57.320 --> 3:28:02.120]  to tackle the coronavirus outbreak, asserting that doing so would create, quote, fear and
[3:28:02.120 --> 3:28:03.880]  stigma.
[3:28:03.880 --> 3:28:11.240]  Mr. General of the WHO, Tedros Adeham Gilbrises, probably got that totally wrong in that pronunciation,
[3:28:11.240 --> 3:28:14.680]  said in a statement that travel restrictions can have the effect of increasing fear and
[3:28:14.680 --> 3:28:17.200]  stigma with little public health benefit.
[3:28:17.200 --> 3:28:22.640]  This is exactly what they said in their official statement when they declared coronavirus to
[3:28:22.640 --> 3:28:24.280]  be a global emergency.
[3:28:24.280 --> 3:28:30.880]  They stressed over and over again that countries should not impose any kind of travel restrictions
[3:28:30.880 --> 3:28:34.280]  because basically people's feelings might get hurt.
[3:28:34.280 --> 3:28:36.320]  That's what it came down to.
[3:28:36.320 --> 3:28:38.560]  People might be offended.
[3:28:38.560 --> 3:28:40.800]  So we're going to get into more of that after the break.
[3:28:40.800 --> 3:28:46.680]  We're going to also get into the latest social media censorship with, again, people being
[3:28:46.680 --> 3:28:49.000]  the platform for using the word fat.
[3:28:49.000 --> 3:28:52.360]  Meanwhile, actual pedophiles are allowed to operate.
[3:28:52.360 --> 3:28:54.160]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[3:28:54.160 --> 3:28:58.760]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[3:28:58.760 --> 3:29:01.160]  by you, but the symptoms are there.
[3:29:01.160 --> 3:29:06.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[3:29:06.000 --> 3:29:09.560]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[3:29:09.560 --> 3:29:14.080]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[3:29:14.080 --> 3:29:15.080]  across America.
[3:29:15.080 --> 3:29:17.080]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[3:29:17.080 --> 3:29:19.600]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[3:29:19.600 --> 3:29:22.640]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[3:29:22.640 --> 3:29:23.640]  healthier I feel.
[3:29:23.640 --> 3:29:26.280]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[3:29:26.280 --> 3:29:31.480]  Maybe over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[3:29:31.480 --> 3:29:33.960]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[3:29:53.120 --> 3:29:59.120]  Alex Jones here reporting from the road on the incredibly dangerous developments concerning
[3:29:59.120 --> 3:30:00.120]  the coronavirus.
[3:30:00.120 --> 3:30:03.960]  He has now infected hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people.
[3:30:03.960 --> 3:30:09.600]  It has now spread across the entire planet and of course we've now discovered that indeed
[3:30:09.600 --> 3:30:11.560]  it is man-made and engineered.
[3:30:11.560 --> 3:30:16.040]  We're covering it live all with our team at infowars.com for a slash show and band
[3:30:16.040 --> 3:30:17.040]  dot video.
[3:30:17.040 --> 3:30:23.360]  On top of that we have the patented nano silver that Congress A&M and Homeland Security have
[3:30:23.360 --> 3:30:28.480]  certified is able to take out the corona family virus as the SARS.
[3:30:28.480 --> 3:30:29.720]  That's what it comes out of.
[3:30:29.720 --> 3:30:34.320]  We have that at 40% off despite the fact that it's selling out in three different sizes
[3:30:34.320 --> 3:30:41.600]  at infowarsstore.com and that's what I'm using, what my family is using as a frontline defense.
[3:30:41.600 --> 3:30:46.280]  Nothing's perfect except prayer in God's intervention and we hope that this thing isn't as bad as
[3:30:46.280 --> 3:30:51.680]  it looks but definitely we know why governments are panicking right now because this is certainly
[3:30:51.680 --> 3:30:53.160]  a bizarre virus.
[3:30:53.160 --> 3:30:59.120]  Folks, once you need the food, once you need the water filters, once you need the masks,
[3:30:59.120 --> 3:31:00.120]  it'll be too late to get them.
[3:31:00.120 --> 3:31:05.680]  You've got to get them now before you find that you require them for survival.
[3:31:05.680 --> 3:31:09.040]  Trust us, this is not something to be messing around with.
[3:31:09.040 --> 3:31:14.760]  Please go to infowarsstore.com, make your purchase today and at least have that part
[3:31:14.760 --> 3:31:21.080]  of survival covered, the food, the time it will take for the rest of society to collapse
[3:31:21.080 --> 3:31:26.160]  or calm down or whatever the case may be, the RZ air filtration mask, M2 mesh, I have
[3:31:26.160 --> 3:31:27.160]  one of those personally.
[3:31:27.160 --> 3:31:30.680]  I've got a couple of these things off the old infowars store.
[3:31:30.680 --> 3:31:31.760]  I am prepared.
[3:31:31.760 --> 3:31:35.400]  Are you, if you're not, infowarsstore.com on sale now.
[3:31:35.400 --> 3:31:39.040]  Everything you need to prepare yourself for whatever comes next, folks, it's not necessarily
[3:31:39.040 --> 3:31:40.040]  the disease.
[3:31:40.040 --> 3:31:42.280]  It's the panic that surrounds the disease.
[3:31:42.280 --> 3:31:46.000]  It's the collapse that the disease would bring upon that you need to be prepared for.
[3:31:46.000 --> 3:31:49.400]  Food will be off the shelves, water won't be available, you might not even be able to
[3:31:49.400 --> 3:31:50.400]  leave your house.
[3:31:50.400 --> 3:31:53.440]  You've got to be prepared before it comes down.
[3:31:53.440 --> 3:31:58.640]  Infowars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[3:31:58.640 --> 3:32:03.960]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[3:32:03.960 --> 3:32:10.680]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[3:32:10.680 --> 3:32:16.520]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[3:32:16.520 --> 3:32:19.440]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[3:32:19.440 --> 3:32:24.480]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[3:32:24.480 --> 3:32:29.840]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[3:32:29.840 --> 3:32:30.840]  symptoms.
[3:32:30.840 --> 3:32:33.520]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[3:32:33.520 --> 3:32:34.760]  It is not an antihistamine.
[3:32:34.760 --> 3:32:39.440]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[3:32:39.440 --> 3:32:45.240]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[3:32:45.240 --> 3:32:47.920]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[3:32:47.920 --> 3:33:17.000]  Get to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[3:33:18.880 --> 3:33:25.840]  So the crackdown in China in response to coronavirus only appears to be getting more severe.
[3:33:25.840 --> 3:33:29.960]  And despite that, the World Health Organization continues to insist that countries in the
[3:33:29.960 --> 3:33:36.120]  rest of the world do not impose measures to restrict travel that might cause stigma or
[3:33:36.120 --> 3:33:41.840]  discrimination because, God forbid, somebody's feelings might get hurt and some people might
[3:33:41.840 --> 3:33:42.840]  be offended.
[3:33:42.840 --> 3:33:45.640]  Not like we're trying to stop a global pandemic, is it?
[3:33:45.640 --> 3:33:49.680]  So the videos coming out of China, as I mentioned before, the break are increasingly horrifying.
[3:33:49.680 --> 3:33:55.520]  Again, report, woman in China shot dead for attempting to break through coronavirus roadblock.
[3:33:55.520 --> 3:33:58.040]  We have that taking place.
[3:33:58.040 --> 3:34:03.000]  Zero Heads reports China unveils stunning community lockdown in Nanjing.
[3:34:03.000 --> 3:34:06.680]  Unreported sick will be punishable by law.
[3:34:06.680 --> 3:34:10.560]  It says, in a stunning announcement by officials in Nanjing Province, authorities have unveiled
[3:34:10.560 --> 3:34:14.360]  what amounts to full martial law and furthermore taking enforcement and reporting of the sick.
[3:34:14.360 --> 3:34:20.000]  Seriously, all these measures are being applauded by the WHO.
[3:34:20.000 --> 3:34:25.120]  They're saying China is doing a fantastic job, despite other experts saying that they're
[3:34:25.120 --> 3:34:29.440]  grossly underreporting the actual numbers of infected people.
[3:34:29.440 --> 3:34:35.040]  But officials in Nanjing Province issued a notice to further strengthen community management
[3:34:35.040 --> 3:34:37.800]  during epidemic prevention and control.
[3:34:37.800 --> 3:34:41.880]  They talk about if an outbreak occurs in a rented house without a timely report, the
[3:34:41.880 --> 3:34:46.680]  leasing unit or individual of the house will be held accountable according to the law.
[3:34:46.680 --> 3:34:52.280]  And as I mentioned before, basically that means the death penalty, if you deliberately
[3:34:52.280 --> 3:34:57.960]  try to infect somebody else with coronavirus by deliberately infected, that includes not
[3:34:57.960 --> 3:35:01.440]  being dragged away in these vans, as we saw in the clip before the break.
[3:35:01.440 --> 3:35:07.600]  I saw another video where they literally poured concrete to cover up the front door of somebody
[3:35:07.600 --> 3:35:09.960]  suspected to be infected with coronavirus.
[3:35:09.960 --> 3:35:14.480]  And, you know, you could make the argument that if it's such a serious situation, then
[3:35:14.480 --> 3:35:18.640]  those kind of measures are necessary, and the WHO is praising them.
[3:35:18.640 --> 3:35:24.760]  But when anyone else tries to impose any measures, this guy, as I mentioned in the article, says
[3:35:24.760 --> 3:35:29.200]  that that shouldn't take place because some people might get offended.
[3:35:29.200 --> 3:35:33.960]  This is the director general of the World Health Organization headline, WHO demands
[3:35:33.960 --> 3:35:39.280]  countries not impose travel restrictions to avoid fear and stigma.
[3:35:39.280 --> 3:35:43.680]  He said, travel restrictions can have the effect of increasing fear and stigma with
[3:35:43.680 --> 3:35:46.080]  little public health benefit.
[3:35:46.080 --> 3:35:49.960]  Where such measures have been implemented, we urge that they are short in duration proportionate
[3:35:49.960 --> 3:35:54.720]  to the public health risks and are reconsidered regularly as the situation evolves.
[3:35:54.720 --> 3:35:59.960]  So he's saying that imposing any kind of travel restrictions will create stigma, but
[3:35:59.960 --> 3:36:04.960]  22, at least 22 countries have already imposed travel restrictions.
[3:36:04.960 --> 3:36:09.120]  Of course, we saw Mongolia closing their border with Russia.
[3:36:09.120 --> 3:36:11.240]  We saw Israel shutting down its flights.
[3:36:11.240 --> 3:36:13.560]  We saw Russia closing its border with China.
[3:36:13.560 --> 3:36:19.800]  We've seen many American airliners now cancelling all their flights in and out of China.
[3:36:19.800 --> 3:36:27.400]  So people are countries, or in some cases airliners, companies are ignoring the WHO.
[3:36:27.400 --> 3:36:32.960]  I just saw that companies Hyundai have stopped all production of cars in South Korea with
[3:36:32.960 --> 3:36:34.120]  parts from China.
[3:36:34.120 --> 3:36:37.240]  So you've got companies doing that too.
[3:36:37.240 --> 3:36:41.280]  Metro Edge comments that this is happening at the same time as China is blocking travel
[3:36:41.280 --> 3:36:47.080]  to Macau and enforcing martial law almost nationwide, since when did the WHO not err
[3:36:47.080 --> 3:36:48.720]  on the side of caution?
[3:36:48.720 --> 3:36:53.000]  This is stunningly irresponsible advice.
[3:36:53.000 --> 3:36:57.120]  But again, as we highlighted last week, they said exactly the same thing.
[3:36:57.120 --> 3:37:02.640]  The organization cautioned against any actions that would, quote, promote stigma or discrimination.
[3:37:02.640 --> 3:37:07.600]  Of course, on the flip side of that, you've had media outlets in the West saying that
[3:37:07.600 --> 3:37:14.360]  anybody who talks about the extravagant dietary habits of Chinese people is also spreading
[3:37:14.360 --> 3:37:18.880]  racist conspiracy theories and that they should be censored and that they should be banned,
[3:37:18.880 --> 3:37:24.520]  despite peer-reviewed academic studies now confirming that bats were the origin of the
[3:37:24.520 --> 3:37:25.520]  coronavirus.
[3:37:25.520 --> 3:37:29.800]  They don't know for sure, but there have been two major academic studies that have suggested
[3:37:29.800 --> 3:37:35.640]  that we know for a fact that bats were the source of both SARS in Asia and the Ebola
[3:37:35.640 --> 3:37:37.280]  outbreak in Africa.
[3:37:37.280 --> 3:37:42.760]  But if you dare talk about that, then you're spreading a racist conspiracy theory.
[3:37:42.760 --> 3:37:48.120]  Of course, we had zero hedge band over the weekend for suggesting that that virology
[3:37:48.120 --> 3:37:52.520]  research unit situated 10 miles from the source of the outbreak.
[3:37:52.520 --> 3:37:54.320]  Maybe that had something to do with it.
[3:37:54.320 --> 3:37:56.120]  You can't even say that anymore.
[3:37:56.120 --> 3:38:01.800]  They got banned for Twitter for that, but now the WHO is once again saying that hurt
[3:38:01.800 --> 3:38:05.280]  feelings are more important than stopping a global pandemic, apparently.
[3:38:05.280 --> 3:38:09.880]  All right, in the article, what would it take for the cherished sanctity of the mass movement
[3:38:09.880 --> 3:38:11.040]  of people to be challenged?
[3:38:11.040 --> 3:38:15.680]  A global pandemic, hundreds of thousands of dead people, is avoiding hurt feelings more
[3:38:15.680 --> 3:38:19.480]  important, it seems to the WHO?
[3:38:19.480 --> 3:38:20.480]  It indeed is.
[3:38:20.480 --> 3:38:26.280]  Meanwhile, on the subject of social media censorship, I just mentioned it there, because
[3:38:26.280 --> 3:38:32.680]  zero hedge got banned for some say doxing one of the virologists that worked in the
[3:38:32.680 --> 3:38:39.120]  Wuhan research facility, even though his information was publicly available, others say it was
[3:38:39.120 --> 3:38:41.800]  for harassment.
[3:38:41.800 --> 3:38:46.280]  But the guy who wrote the BuzzFeed article that got them de-platformed, because that's
[3:38:46.280 --> 3:38:51.000]  what they do, routinely, of course, they say, they go to these social media companies and
[3:38:51.000 --> 3:38:53.160]  say, doesn't this violate your policy?
[3:38:53.160 --> 3:38:55.000]  Doesn't this violate your policy?
[3:38:55.000 --> 3:39:00.040]  Their entire career now seems to be based around abusing their position as a quote journalist
[3:39:00.040 --> 3:39:03.080]  to get their competition banned and censored.
[3:39:03.080 --> 3:39:08.280]  This is a headline out of Cernovich.com, racism and pedophile jokes of BuzzFeed reporters'
[3:39:08.280 --> 3:39:09.920]  history of vile tweets.
[3:39:09.920 --> 3:39:11.880]  We mentioned this the other day.
[3:39:11.880 --> 3:39:17.880]  This is Ryan Broderick, BuzzFeed writer, who basically got zero hedge de-platform banned
[3:39:17.880 --> 3:39:19.000]  on Twitter.
[3:39:19.000 --> 3:39:26.240]  So they did some digging into his previous tweets in which he said, quote, Mr. President,
[3:39:26.240 --> 3:39:32.120]  can you please pass legislation legally defining the difference between us, good natured, heberfiles
[3:39:32.120 --> 3:39:34.520]  and amoral pedophiles?
[3:39:34.520 --> 3:39:35.520]  What is a heberfile?
[3:39:35.520 --> 3:39:41.360]  It's somebody who is attracted to minors, teenagers, pubescent teenagers.
[3:39:41.360 --> 3:39:42.360]  There are other tweets.
[3:39:42.360 --> 3:39:46.480]  There's another tweet where he said, quote, every movie should open with a scene where
[3:39:46.480 --> 3:39:49.880]  a child watches Rob Lowe have sex.
[3:39:49.880 --> 3:39:53.320]  These tweets from BuzzFeed's Ryan Broderick are now being deleted.
[3:39:53.320 --> 3:39:59.840]  He posted other texts on his blog where he's talking about, quote, you could post nothing
[3:39:59.840 --> 3:40:03.080]  but minus the bear and child pornography.
[3:40:03.080 --> 3:40:07.880]  Some of those blogs have now been deleted, but a lot of this is still on Twitter.
[3:40:07.880 --> 3:40:11.400]  He faces no action whatsoever.
[3:40:11.400 --> 3:40:16.480]  Meanwhile, a headline here out of Fox News, comfortably smug Twitter accounts suspended
[3:40:16.480 --> 3:40:17.480]  for harassment.
[3:40:17.480 --> 3:40:21.440]  Twitter suspended an account popular among young conservatives is Monday for violating
[3:40:21.440 --> 3:40:24.280]  the site's abuse and harassment policies.
[3:40:24.280 --> 3:40:25.800]  And this was comfortably smug.
[3:40:25.800 --> 3:40:29.960]  What did they do to violate Twitter's policies?
[3:40:29.960 --> 3:40:34.160]  They suspended the account after it tweeted, where's hunter fat?
[3:40:34.160 --> 3:40:38.680]  In response to another tweet about 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden's grandchildren being in
[3:40:38.680 --> 3:40:41.640]  Iowa for the caucuses.
[3:40:41.640 --> 3:40:47.680]  Of course, Biden himself said that during a campaign event when he appeared to address
[3:40:47.680 --> 3:40:52.360]  an audience member at one of his events by saying, look fat.
[3:40:52.360 --> 3:40:58.320]  But the Twitter account that made reference to this as a joke and used the word fat was
[3:40:58.320 --> 3:41:00.720]  suspended by Twitter.
[3:41:00.720 --> 3:41:06.360]  I think it's now back online, but again, another example of the absolute double standard.
[3:41:06.360 --> 3:41:11.920]  Meanwhile, the post millennial reports exclusive pedophiles are using Twitter to share child
[3:41:11.920 --> 3:41:12.920]  porn.
[3:41:12.920 --> 3:41:15.080]  This is something we've talked about before.
[3:41:15.080 --> 3:41:20.920]  There are whole networks of Twitter accounts called maps, minor attracted persons, which
[3:41:20.920 --> 3:41:24.920]  are basically pedophiles who say, oh, I would never molest a child, but I'm just going to
[3:41:24.920 --> 3:41:26.880]  admit to being attracted to them.
[3:41:26.880 --> 3:41:31.400]  And that's my sexuality, so you should tolerate it.
[3:41:31.400 --> 3:41:34.480]  Thousands of those people are allowed to operate on Twitter.
[3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:36.440]  Nothing is done about it.
[3:41:36.440 --> 3:41:41.240]  A new investigation by the post millennial reveals that the distribution of child pornography
[3:41:41.240 --> 3:41:43.440]  is happening in plain sight.
[3:41:43.440 --> 3:41:47.760]  Of course, we had this on YouTube because last year that went on for years with pedophiles
[3:41:47.760 --> 3:41:53.720]  organizing it into networks and highlighting segments of videos featuring children where
[3:41:53.720 --> 3:41:57.400]  they appeared in poses that turned on these monsters.
[3:41:57.400 --> 3:41:58.880]  That took years to get rid of.
[3:41:58.880 --> 3:42:02.400]  Meanwhile, YouTube was banning people for their speech.
[3:42:02.400 --> 3:42:05.480]  Article continues, while many believe the distribution of these illicit materials is
[3:42:05.480 --> 3:42:10.520]  relegated to the seedy underbelly of the internet, this belief is far from true.
[3:42:10.520 --> 3:42:15.240]  On Twitter, pedophiles seeking to exchange child pornography and other child sex exploitation
[3:42:15.240 --> 3:42:21.120]  images are utilizing secret hashtags to signal their presence and interest to each other.
[3:42:21.120 --> 3:42:24.400]  And it goes on to explain what some of those are.
[3:42:24.400 --> 3:42:28.400]  These accounts are numerous and Twitter does little to crack down on their existence in
[3:42:28.400 --> 3:42:29.400]  spite of reports.
[3:42:29.400 --> 3:42:34.000]  And I've seen many examples where people try to target these accounts, call them out,
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:39.720]  highlight them to Twitter, and then the people who try to do that are themselves then suspended
[3:42:39.720 --> 3:42:41.000]  or banned by Twitter.
[3:42:41.000 --> 3:42:43.000]  So Twitter has a huge pedophile problem.
[3:42:43.000 --> 3:42:44.600]  They're doing nothing about it.
[3:42:44.600 --> 3:42:48.400]  Meanwhile, they're suspending people for using the word fat.
[3:42:48.400 --> 3:42:49.400]  Don't go away.
[3:42:49.400 --> 3:42:50.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:42:50.400 --> 3:42:54.160]  Well, it's here, the year 2020.
[3:42:54.160 --> 3:42:55.520]  World governments out in the open.
[3:42:55.520 --> 3:42:59.240]  We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as
[3:42:59.240 --> 3:43:00.240]  the answer.
[3:43:00.240 --> 3:43:05.280]  And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place that's coordinated by big tech and
[3:43:05.280 --> 3:43:11.680]  banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family
[3:43:11.680 --> 3:43:13.880]  and the protection of the unborn.
[3:43:13.880 --> 3:43:14.880]  Wow.
[3:43:14.880 --> 3:43:16.080]  Yes, now we know we're right.
[3:43:16.080 --> 3:43:20.400]  The new world order is real, Satanism is real, the pedophile leader real, but we're real
[3:43:20.400 --> 3:43:24.280]  as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying, no, but I just want to make
[3:43:24.280 --> 3:43:28.320]  the point here one month into 2020 that we have never been in Kansas.
[3:43:28.320 --> 3:43:32.320]  We have never been in some smallville place that didn't matter.
[3:43:32.320 --> 3:43:37.160]  Everything we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything
[3:43:37.160 --> 3:43:38.880]  we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[3:43:38.880 --> 3:43:40.120]  So it's an incredible town to be alive.
[3:43:40.120 --> 3:43:43.240]  I'm going to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[3:43:43.240 --> 3:43:49.120]  Just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth and financial support of MP4store.com
[3:43:49.120 --> 3:43:52.840]  is critical, so please take action.
[3:43:52.840 --> 3:43:58.160]  It's amazing that we have the only patented nano silver that's been found by Homeland
[3:43:58.160 --> 3:44:03.480]  Security to take out SARS, which is the same family as the Corona virus.
[3:44:03.480 --> 3:44:06.640]  We have it in our super silver toothpaste.
[3:44:06.640 --> 3:44:08.600]  We have it in our super blue toothpaste.
[3:44:08.600 --> 3:44:14.320]  We have it in the immune gargle products and of course it's in the super silver wound gel
[3:44:14.320 --> 3:44:15.560]  that is sold nationally.
[3:44:15.560 --> 3:44:21.520]  We just private label it from the people that produce it, the nano tech company out of Colorado.
[3:44:21.520 --> 3:44:28.400]  And we have a stockpile of it, but we've already sold half of the stockpile of it and I'm still
[3:44:28.400 --> 3:44:35.560]  offering the products at 42, 50% off and then fullwarstore.com until they sell out, which
[3:44:35.560 --> 3:44:39.880]  most of these products are set to sell out within days or then about another week.
[3:44:39.880 --> 3:44:44.360]  So go to infowarstore.com to get your immune gargle, to get the toothpaste and to get the
[3:44:44.360 --> 3:44:48.640]  super silver wound gel, but the immune gargle is what is so important because you gargle

[3:44:54.000 --> 3:45:01.080]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins, there are many reasons why we need to think
[3:45:01.080 --> 3:45:03.680]  about what is really in the air around us.
[3:45:03.680 --> 3:45:08.080]  You may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.

[3:46:02.960 --> 3:46:07.840]  Our suppliers have it in-house, mistaken 7 to 10 days to deliver, because again they
[3:46:07.840 --> 3:46:12.440]  have to package it, they're running 24 hours a day, but in a few days they're telling
[3:46:12.440 --> 3:46:15.760]  me it may go to a longer wait if you haven't gotten your order in.

[3:46:19.520 --> 3:46:20.520]  be hide.
[3:46:20.520 --> 3:46:25.120]  Looks like it is really, really bad and is man made, and so that's why we're seeing

[3:46:48.520 --> 3:47:17.920]  just keeping it at that sales price, infowarstore.com.
[3:47:17.920 --> 3:47:21.680]  And we are live in the final segment before I hit some final news stories, want to direct

[3:47:39.400 --> 3:47:41.240]  right now at infowarstore.com.

[3:48:42.760 --> 3:48:44.600]  and nutritious meal.
[3:48:44.600 --> 3:48:49.200]  That is a massive, massive saving on if you're trying to buy this food elsewhere.
[3:48:49.200 --> 3:48:54.200]  I know in the past I've tried to buy it in Europe and the prices were absolutely astronomical

[3:49:38.960 --> 3:49:43.680]  Now I was talking about social media censorship again before the break is another article
[3:49:43.680 --> 3:49:45.200]  in the context of that.
[3:49:45.200 --> 3:49:51.760]  This is from the Australia, Israel and Jewish Affairs Council who are not happy about certain
[3:49:51.760 --> 3:49:54.720]  people using TikTok.
[3:49:54.720 --> 3:49:59.960]  Headline is anti social media and it says there's a good chance you haven't spent a
[3:49:59.960 --> 3:50:01.920]  lot of time on the social media app.
[3:50:01.920 --> 3:50:07.320]  Well, yeah, mainly because it's for teenagers, however, it's popularity is growing.
[3:50:07.320 --> 3:50:12.080]  The Chinese owned video app has been downloaded more than 1.5 billion times globally.
[3:50:12.080 --> 3:50:17.560]  In 2019, it was downloaded more times than Facebook or Instagram.
[3:50:17.560 --> 3:50:22.720]  And that means they're terrified about anyone who they don't control using it.
[3:50:22.720 --> 3:50:28.880]  Even though TikTok is not really geared or designed for delivering news or commentary,
[3:50:28.880 --> 3:50:32.240]  they are absolutely terrified at certain people using it.
[3:50:32.240 --> 3:50:34.960]  Who are those certain people?
[3:50:34.960 --> 3:50:41.360]  Well it goes on to mention far right extremists, Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson, who's
[3:50:41.360 --> 3:50:47.200]  the source of us being far right extremists, Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, a truly independent
[3:50:47.200 --> 3:50:48.200]  arbiter.
[3:50:48.200 --> 3:50:49.560]  I'm sure you'll agree.
[3:50:49.560 --> 3:50:53.840]  And followers of the hate group Proud Boys and then it basically just lists a bunch of
[3:50:53.840 --> 3:50:58.040]  like actual neo-Nazis to lump us all in with the same thing.
[3:50:58.040 --> 3:51:03.000]  So even though I barely even use TikTok, I've probably got about 300 followers.
[3:51:03.000 --> 3:51:06.760]  Now they're trying to get as de-platformed off that.
[3:51:06.760 --> 3:51:11.120]  The people who aren't going to be de-platformed though are people on Twitter who celebrated
[3:51:11.120 --> 3:51:13.440]  Rush Limbaugh getting cancer.
[3:51:13.440 --> 3:51:19.520]  So much for the tolerant left, verified leftists celebrate Rush Limbaugh's cancer on Twitter.
[3:51:19.520 --> 3:51:23.120]  Does this violate any of their hate or harassment policies?
[3:51:23.120 --> 3:51:28.880]  It doesn't look like it because all these blue check marks who celebrated him getting
[3:51:28.880 --> 3:51:32.480]  cancer, their tweets all seem to still be there.
[3:51:32.480 --> 3:51:36.480]  What a surprise, none of them have been deleted.
[3:51:36.480 --> 3:51:39.920]  Article reads numerous verified leftists on Twitter reacted to Rush Limbaugh's announcement
[3:51:39.920 --> 3:51:44.720]  that he was suffering from advanced lung cancer by celebrating the news.
[3:51:44.720 --> 3:51:51.200]  One of them, Johnny McNulty, wrote it's not cool to joke about Rush Limbaugh having cancer,
[3:51:51.200 --> 3:51:52.900]  you might jinx it.
[3:51:52.900 --> 3:51:58.200]  Another individual, a writer and director called Javier Bergen, called Limbaugh an odious
[3:51:58.200 --> 3:52:03.760]  white supremacist scum of the earth and said his cancer should be celebrated as good news
[3:52:03.760 --> 3:52:10.360]  for Black History Month, bearing in mind that, as I just mentioned, an account was literally
[3:52:10.360 --> 3:52:15.960]  just suspended for using the word fact, but apparently if you celebrate somebody getting
[3:52:15.960 --> 3:52:22.360]  advanced lung cancer, that's completely within the terms of service.
[3:52:22.360 --> 3:52:25.920]  Another person, Freddie Campion, said seeing a lot of people celebrating the news about
[3:52:25.920 --> 3:52:31.320]  Rush Limbaugh and I just want to say good, carry on, he's a GQ writer.
[3:52:31.320 --> 3:52:35.240]  New York Times bestselling author Jamie Ford, again, these are all verified check marks
[3:52:35.240 --> 3:52:39.700]  on Twitter, reacted to Limbaugh's cancer by equating him with a fascist and commenting
[3:52:39.700 --> 3:52:42.800]  history is a harsh mistress.
[3:52:42.800 --> 3:52:47.280]  John Taylor tweeted, it's only fitting that this cancer upon the world should be stricken
[3:52:47.280 --> 3:52:48.780]  by it.
[3:52:48.780 --> 3:52:53.920]  Media Matters, Oliver Willis reacted to the tragic news by calling Limbaugh a sexist.
[3:52:53.920 --> 3:52:57.960]  And then there were numerous other individuals without blue check marks, but who were just
[3:52:57.960 --> 3:53:01.360]  as enthusiastic about Rush Limbaugh dying.
[3:53:01.360 --> 3:53:05.600]  One of them, Christopher Orloff said, counterpoint to what seems to be the prevailing opinion
[3:53:05.600 --> 3:53:12.600]  on Rush Limbaugh's cancer, F Rush Limbaugh, also F his cancer for being 40 years too late.
[3:53:12.600 --> 3:53:17.720]  Again, these are the people who will assert the moral high ground at every available opportunity
[3:53:17.720 --> 3:53:23.320]  over you, but then literally clink champagne glasses when somebody gets a terminal illness
[3:53:23.320 --> 3:53:28.040]  because they're the good guys and they will remain on the platform.
[3:53:28.040 --> 3:53:33.320]  Some good news out of Canada, this is out of the Toronto Sun, Trudeau walks away from
[3:53:33.320 --> 3:53:35.400]  regulating media.
[3:53:35.400 --> 3:53:39.160]  Of course, we told you about this yesterday, they were going to go ahead with the policy
[3:53:39.160 --> 3:53:44.320]  of forcing websites, including alternative media and small websites to get licenses
[3:53:44.320 --> 3:53:48.680]  to operate in Canada, which would basically mean, of course, government permission to
[3:53:48.680 --> 3:53:53.440]  operate and that government permission could be removed at a moment's notice.
[3:53:53.440 --> 3:53:57.880]  Well, now the article reads, it's one of the fastest reversals of government policy that
[3:53:57.880 --> 3:53:59.360]  I've ever seen.
[3:53:59.360 --> 3:54:03.600]  On Sunday, the Trudeau Liberals were promising to bring in a licensing regime for news outlets
[3:54:03.600 --> 3:54:09.000]  and podcasters, again, government permission to use the internet to have a website.
[3:54:09.000 --> 3:54:12.040]  By Monday, they were singing the praises of a free press.
[3:54:12.040 --> 3:54:16.840]  It all started last week when a panel headed by Justin Trudeau himself to examine the future
[3:54:16.840 --> 3:54:20.880]  of media in Canada released their final report.
[3:54:20.880 --> 3:54:24.160]  And then they had some interviews with some of the people behind this report.
[3:54:24.160 --> 3:54:29.040]  There was a big backlash, and now at least for the time being, it seems that they have
[3:54:29.040 --> 3:54:30.280]  stood down.
[3:54:30.280 --> 3:54:34.160]  So that is at least some good news in terms of free speech coming out of Canada, which
[3:54:34.160 --> 3:54:37.960]  is not really known as a haven for free speech, is it?
[3:54:37.960 --> 3:54:43.120]  My news report strengthened terrorist father, I told him not to be naughty.
[3:54:43.120 --> 3:54:47.360]  This is the terrorist who stabbed two people on the streets of London on Sunday.
[3:54:47.360 --> 3:54:53.080]  This is the guy who was released halfway through his prison sentence, despite literally telling
[3:54:53.080 --> 3:54:57.200]  his girlfriend to behead her parents because they weren't Muslims.
[3:54:57.200 --> 3:55:03.000]  Despite planning terror attacks, despite having material related to making bombs, they released
[3:55:03.000 --> 3:55:08.600]  him halfway through a three-year, four-month sentence, just as the previous London terrorist
[3:55:08.600 --> 3:55:13.400]  as Mankhan was released halfway through his sentence, despite plotting to bomb the London
[3:55:13.400 --> 3:55:17.920]  Stock Exchange and murder then-London Mayor Boris Johnson.
[3:55:17.920 --> 3:55:22.880]  Boris Johnson, well now, the father of the Stratham terrorist, Sudash Amman, has told
[3:55:22.880 --> 3:55:26.920]  Sky News he spoke to his son a day before the attack and told him not to be naughty.
[3:55:26.920 --> 3:55:31.560]  Now, this sounds like absent parenting to the nth degree.
[3:55:31.560 --> 3:55:35.720]  Maraz Khan, who left the UK three months ago, said he learned about his son's death from
[3:55:35.720 --> 3:55:41.240]  a cousin who messaged him, went on to say, I spoke to Sudash one day before he passed
[3:55:41.240 --> 3:55:42.240]  away.
[3:55:42.240 --> 3:55:43.640]  I didn't know he had become radicalized.
[3:55:43.640 --> 3:55:45.640]  Well, that's interesting, isn't it?
[3:55:45.640 --> 3:55:49.920]  Because we already know the fact that this guy was attempting to radicalize members of
[3:55:49.920 --> 3:55:54.920]  his own family by showing them ISIS and al-Qaeda propaganda.
[3:55:54.920 --> 3:56:00.640]  So either the father is lying or he's completely absent and he didn't know about that.
[3:56:00.640 --> 3:56:03.960]  He went on to say his son would speak to him about religion and Islam.
[3:56:03.960 --> 3:56:08.080]  He was reciting the Qur'an to me and he was translating that to me, but he wasn't doing
[3:56:08.080 --> 3:56:10.160]  anything that would radicalize him.
[3:56:10.160 --> 3:56:11.160]  Oh, no.
[3:56:11.160 --> 3:56:15.320]  Remember, this terrorist came out of Belmarsh prison.
[3:56:15.320 --> 3:56:20.960]  I explained this yesterday, which is completely run by Islamic terrorists, basically.
[3:56:20.960 --> 3:56:24.520]  Anyone who goes in there, who they get their teeth into, is radicalized and then they just
[3:56:24.520 --> 3:56:27.520]  release them again and then we get events like this.
[3:56:27.520 --> 3:56:34.480]  And of course, the prison population at Belmarsh, the Muslim prison population is 30 percent.
[3:56:34.480 --> 3:56:37.400]  That's doubled over the past five years.
[3:56:37.400 --> 3:56:43.720]  And then you look at other prisons in London where the Muslim population is 42 percent
[3:56:43.720 --> 3:56:46.520]  or in some cases, even higher.
[3:56:46.520 --> 3:56:49.960]  Now the Muslim population of London officially is 12 percent.
[3:56:49.960 --> 3:56:57.440]  So that means that Muslims in prison are overrepresented by a third or indeed a half.
[3:56:57.440 --> 3:56:59.080]  There's a massive problem.
[3:56:59.080 --> 3:57:00.760]  Nothing is really being done to stop it.
[3:57:00.760 --> 3:57:02.560]  They're trying to pass new laws to get it done.
[3:57:02.560 --> 3:57:04.480]  We'll see if that takes effect.
[3:57:04.480 --> 3:57:09.320]  Meanwhile, RT reports, radicalizing troops, 19-year-old rookie soldier named suspect in
[3:57:09.320 --> 3:57:14.680]  French police station, knife attack after ISIS threat, phone call.
[3:57:14.680 --> 3:57:18.920]  This was a 19-year-old service man who was actually enrolled.
[3:57:18.920 --> 3:57:25.000]  He tried to carry out a knife attack in the name of ISIS on a French police station.
[3:57:25.000 --> 3:57:29.720]  They got a warning beforehand, but now they've literally got enlisted soldiers who have been
[3:57:29.720 --> 3:57:34.480]  radicalized by Islamic terrorist propaganda carrying out inside job attacks.
[3:57:34.480 --> 3:57:41.760]  That's how bad the situation is in France.
