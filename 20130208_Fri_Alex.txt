[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:41.960]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:41.960 --> 00:49.440]  Back in the saddle again, ladies and gentlemen. And it is Friday, the eighth day of February
[00:49.440 --> 00:56.960]  2013. I am your host, Alex Jones, and we will be here live for the next three hours and
[00:56.960 --> 01:02.320]  taking your phone calls. You know something, I don't think the end of the world is coming
[01:02.320 --> 01:03.840]  in the next few days.
[01:03.840 --> 01:10.180]  But when the government says there's absolutely no danger, they're such congenital liars,
[01:10.180 --> 01:16.600]  it tends to make me take a double take. And we have asteroid to travel and traverse Earth's
[01:16.600 --> 01:21.920]  satellite zones, NASA says. Now, of course, there are satellites that are close in and
[01:21.920 --> 01:28.380]  satellites that are a little bit further out, but it's still in the scope of the solar system.
[01:28.380 --> 01:34.480]  This bullet is like in a Looney Tunes when Yosemite Sam shoots at somebody and they say,
[01:34.480 --> 01:40.160]  hey, you missed me. And then you see a hair on their head go, because it's split the hair
[01:40.160 --> 01:41.160]  up.
[01:41.160 --> 01:47.280]  This is like, is it Ivanhoe that shoots the arrow and it hits the apple? Yeah, I think
[01:47.280 --> 01:51.160]  it is Ivanhoe that shoots the arrow and it hits the apple. The point is that's what's
[01:51.160 --> 01:57.800]  happening here. And in fact, in the scale of the solar system or in the scale of asteroids,
[01:57.800 --> 02:01.000]  it's so gigantic as well.
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.360]  And it's moving five times the speed of a high velocity rifle round. To give you an
[02:06.360 --> 02:13.080]  idea, a high velocity rifle round goes about 3,000 feet per second, yeah. I was out shooting
[02:13.080 --> 02:20.120]  a 50 cal BMG yesterday, that was absolutely awesome. We'll talk more about that in the
[02:20.120 --> 02:23.720]  days to come, we're gonna do a video shoot with it, talking about the Second Amendment.
[02:23.720 --> 02:31.280]  But that's a side issue, I took off 24 hours and took the children camping with our kind
[02:31.280 --> 02:40.320]  host and certainly enjoyed that. Little fishing, little camping, little mini vacation, very
[02:40.320 --> 02:41.640]  restorative.
[02:41.640 --> 02:47.240]  They had a stock tank with some of the biggest stock tank bass I've ever seen. It's usually
[02:47.240 --> 02:51.240]  they overpopulate in the tank and then they start getting smaller. And if you're not a
[02:51.240 --> 02:56.920]  fisher person, you think a tank, not like a fish tank, a small lake. Sometimes every
[02:56.920 --> 03:01.360]  time we cast, we were jerking in like two, three pound bass. And I could see some like
[03:01.360 --> 03:04.160]  10 pounders or more swimming around out there.
[03:04.160 --> 03:07.680]  I tell you what the biggest bass I've ever seen are, they're in Barton Springs. Some
[03:07.680 --> 03:12.040]  of those things have got away 25 pounds, be a state record. Okay, you can tell I've been
[03:12.040 --> 03:20.040]  on vacation mode, 24 hour little sneak vacation. But sleeping under the stars has never been
[03:20.040 --> 03:23.880]  so good. Problem is we haven't had much of a winner here. I didn't pay enough money,
[03:23.880 --> 03:27.160]  Al Gore, he would fix that. No, no, we've had some freezing temperatures. It was like
[03:27.160 --> 03:30.600]  60 degrees at night, about 80 degrees yesterday in the afternoon.
[03:30.600 --> 03:35.880]  And I'm now giving you a weather report, so I'm gonna stop that right now. Okay, when
[03:35.880 --> 03:40.600]  we come back, I'm gonna reset, get focused and get into the main transmission here. We're
[03:40.600 --> 03:48.760]  gonna get into the asteroid. We're gonna get into, this little headline up at mfoawars.com,
[03:48.760 --> 03:53.920]  gunplanted.com. That's kind of important, you might wanna go check it out and get it
[03:53.920 --> 03:57.400]  out to everybody you know, because I even noticed the big gun sites haven't even picked
[03:57.400 --> 03:58.920]  up on this.
[03:58.920 --> 04:06.000]  California announces semi-auto confiscation plan. And they just quietly say in the legislation
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.120]  they're announcing that, yeah, it'll be what Cuomo in New York called for and Feinstein
[04:10.120 --> 04:16.640]  has called for. She's out in San Francisco before. A plan to even take guns from people
[04:16.640 --> 04:21.320]  that already have them. They're like, yeah, and by the way, Antonio Vilderoy goes to the
[04:21.320 --> 04:29.960]  mayor of LA, the dawn of that crime sector, and he says, don't worry, I'm going to be
[04:29.960 --> 04:30.960]  coming after those.
[04:30.960 --> 04:35.200]  So get ready to hand them in. Boy, if you think California has already seen an exodus,
[04:35.200 --> 04:40.000]  look out, you're gonna see wagon trains going east. So that's coming up, California announces
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.280]  semi-auto confiscation plan. And it's kind of like the way you let a fart out in church.
[04:44.280 --> 04:49.920]  I'm sorry to use that analogy, it's only to do it. William Tell shot the apple off, I
[04:49.920 --> 04:58.040]  don't know why I said Ivanhoe. It's another Robin Hoodian era character, we'll be right
[04:58.040 --> 05:00.240]  back.

[08:11.280 --> 08:22.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[08:22.960 --> 08:30.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, the eighth day of February 2013. I am your host, Alex
[08:30.720 --> 08:36.400]  Jones, and we are going to be here, Lord willing, for the next few hours and taking your phone
[08:36.400 --> 08:42.520]  calls. And it gets like this more and more every day, but today is a particularly, absolutely
[08:42.520 --> 08:48.960]  jam packed, absolutely crammed, loaded, stacked broadcast.
[08:48.960 --> 08:55.120]  On so many fronts, we're going to report it all. The reported cop killer of these three
[08:55.120 --> 09:02.600]  police officers out in Southern California, former a Navy veteran and a police officer
[09:02.600 --> 09:07.040]  they ran out of the force a few years ago, who they claim has put out this manifesto
[09:07.040 --> 09:09.360]  saying he's going to go after their families.
[09:09.360 --> 09:14.120]  I've read both of his manifestos, if they're real. And let me tell you, if they're not
[09:14.120 --> 09:21.920]  real, the person deserves a Nobel Prize for literature because it sounds exactly like
[09:21.920 --> 09:28.800]  the MO of these mental patients that the system is now tracking and looking for and sifting
[09:28.800 --> 09:33.920]  through who think it's celebrity to be a cop who are into the power trip.
[09:33.920 --> 09:39.960]  How much he loves Biden, Obama, how he fantasizes about Hollywood, how he wants us to turn our
[09:39.960 --> 09:45.160]  guns in, but he's going around saying he's going to kill innocent patrol cops. I mean,
[09:45.160 --> 09:48.600]  he's going to kill people, which I'm not saying you should do, go after the guys he says did
[09:48.600 --> 09:49.600]  something to him.
[09:49.600 --> 09:55.640]  Now he's just randomly shooting patrol cops, reportedly, allegedly. And I've been studying
[09:55.640 --> 10:02.200]  it since yesterday afternoon, just at a snapshot view, it looks like it's a real shooter. People
[10:02.200 --> 10:05.760]  say, well, how do you know that? It's staged by Obama to have a guy go out and start killing
[10:05.760 --> 10:10.440]  people who's an Obama supporter and loves Joe Biden and says, take the citizens guns.
[10:10.440 --> 10:14.760]  Now, this is not the type of stuff the system wants, okay? Just at a glance, people say,
[10:14.760 --> 10:18.680]  well, how do you know? Well, there's hundreds of points at a glance that just come up and
[10:18.680 --> 10:26.120]  then I read both of his diatribes. And it's just the exact type of mental illness that
[10:26.120 --> 10:30.520]  I was talking about last week where all these celebrity wannabes and celebrities are like
[10:30.520 --> 10:33.920]  in this narcissistic delusion.
[10:33.920 --> 10:42.800]  I liken it to what I've seen with five year olds or three year olds dressed up like superheroes
[10:42.800 --> 10:46.980]  or princesses, if it's little girls. They're just feeling so good and they're having little
[10:46.980 --> 10:51.480]  girls like to have fake beauty pageants or like to play like their princesses. And they
[10:51.480 --> 10:55.280]  got all the fake jewels on imagining their princesses or little boys imagine that their
[10:55.280 --> 11:00.660]  GI Joe commandos storming Cobra compound and they get excited because they are modeling
[11:00.660 --> 11:01.720]  that in their mind.
[11:01.720 --> 11:05.400]  And that's what the system does. It goes out and gets, now this is who they target, they
[11:05.400 --> 11:09.040]  admit this is who they look for, kind of weak minded people. They can put a template down
[11:09.040 --> 11:13.880]  in their mind where even if they're torturing secret arrests, setting people up, this is
[11:13.880 --> 11:18.320]  how the good guys win. And it's like this fantasy.
[11:18.320 --> 11:21.760]  You can see these type of people. I mean, I could tell whether somebody is a real police
[11:21.760 --> 11:26.180]  officer with a real history or a real veteran or somebody who's actually been through some
[11:26.180 --> 11:32.820]  real things and got into things because of family or background to wanted to really serve.
[11:32.820 --> 11:38.320]  And then you can see types who are just strutting around. I mean, you can tell they're feeling
[11:38.320 --> 11:45.120]  unsatisfied. And it's like living in the matrix. They must really be enjoying themselves, but
[11:45.120 --> 11:46.520]  they're not living in reality.
[11:46.520 --> 11:50.720]  And you see this with the McDonald's manager on a power trip being mean to their employees
[11:50.720 --> 11:56.840]  and relishing giving the orders. And I mean, it's not just police, but they look for these
[11:56.840 --> 12:03.020]  types and I've gone and really looked into this guy. And just I see all his photos where
[12:03.020 --> 12:12.000]  the eyes are just gleaming and he's smiling. I've seen that look. I've seen that look.
[12:12.000 --> 12:17.920]  It's I've arrived. I'm a superhero. I'm God. I'm a king. I'm a lord. I'm royalty. I'm a
[12:17.920 --> 12:22.920]  movie star. I'm Marie Antoinette. There's an article here about politicians becoming
[12:22.920 --> 12:28.080]  like Marie Antoinette in France where they're on just such power trips no matter who gets
[12:28.080 --> 12:33.200]  into power. Now the socialists are in there just spending millions of euros a week on
[12:33.200 --> 12:38.180]  their lavish lifestyle, on total power trips, just breaking down, hanging out with French
[12:38.180 --> 12:40.400]  movie stars.
[12:40.400 --> 12:49.800]  This is what happens when hollow scum gets power. And it is the most disgusting phenomenon.
[12:49.800 --> 12:56.720]  It makes me sick. It absolutely makes me sick. Somebody with real power is humbled by it.
[12:56.720 --> 13:01.320]  Somebody who has a real background is humbled by it and then also realizes how small they
[13:01.320 --> 13:06.440]  are and understands how much potential they have, but then understands how you're not
[13:06.440 --> 13:07.900]  living up to it.
[13:07.900 --> 13:12.000]  And then there's so many opportunities and so many incredible things. And then you see
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.280]  the ugliness and the dumbness of the general public. And it doesn't make you feel good
[13:16.280 --> 13:22.520]  that they're dumbed down and ugly spiritually, but that it makes you feel bad. And you want
[13:22.520 --> 13:30.920]  to lift people up. But it is just absolutely disgusting. So I'm gonna be talking about
[13:30.920 --> 13:31.920]  that.
[13:31.920 --> 13:35.800]  See, I can't tell you what's coming up cuz I should start writing a what's coming up
[13:35.800 --> 13:39.640]  list after I look at all the news and stuff because I just tend to like, whenever I first
[13:39.640 --> 13:49.360]  mention I just spend 30 minutes on that. This is a big deal with asteroid to diverse Earth's
[13:49.360 --> 13:55.880]  satellite zones, NASA says. And it's just an incredible near miss if you believe what
[13:55.880 --> 13:56.880]  they're saying.
[13:56.880 --> 14:02.980]  And I don't believe this asteroid is gonna kill us. They're probably telling the truth.
[14:02.980 --> 14:09.020]  But they lie so much and NASA has been caught lying so much that I just automatically have
[14:09.020 --> 14:14.280]  a little twinge of concern. But an asteroid half the size of the US football field will
[14:14.280 --> 14:19.400]  pass between Earth and orbiting satellites next week. Sparing the human race from the
[14:19.400 --> 14:20.840]  fate suffered by dinosaurs, NASA says.
[14:20.840 --> 14:25.480]  So we've got a NASA video from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and some other news we're gonna
[14:25.480 --> 14:32.400]  get to. We'll cover that one way or another, guys, at 45 after. I've got to stay on schedule
[14:32.400 --> 14:36.400]  to get to all this. So coming up, I'm gonna get into that in T-minus 30 minutes exactly.
[14:36.400 --> 14:41.760]  It's 15 after 14 minutes, 37 seconds right now into the hour. And then we're going to
[14:41.760 --> 14:50.200]  get into another article dealing with real threats, British schools and hospitals could
[14:50.200 --> 14:53.280]  be at risk in new horse meat fears.
[14:53.280 --> 14:57.840]  Now look, horse meat is completely editable. Speaking of the French, it's actually a delicacy
[14:57.840 --> 15:03.860]  over there. I'm not saying I like horse meat, I've had it before. But sitting here looking
[15:03.860 --> 15:08.960]  at this, they're all freaking out. This is one of the biggest stories in the country
[15:08.960 --> 15:12.700]  right now worldwide, that's all they're talking about.
[15:12.700 --> 15:18.000]  Beef lasagna meats, 100% horse meat, Sky News, my gosh, reading horse meat. And it just shows
[15:18.000 --> 15:24.000]  how they're scamming people. It shows how the system doesn't trust you, the pink, slime,
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.900]  all of it. Of course, that's nothing compared to bromine and the Gatorade. And little girls
[15:28.900 --> 15:33.120]  having babies at age seven and eight now and going into puberty at age three.
[15:33.120 --> 15:38.460]  Guys, now it's age three. And then it's all in the documents that they picked plastics
[15:38.460 --> 15:43.400]  out of hundreds and hundreds of formulae that would do that to you. See, you're not worried
[15:43.400 --> 15:48.640]  about that, a horse meat. My gosh, I bet people go to jail over this, cuz the system loves
[15:48.640 --> 15:49.640]  that.
[15:49.640 --> 15:53.200]  Send you to jail over selling people horse meat, which it is fraud. They shove their
[15:53.200 --> 16:00.240]  butt suit in the ground, not go to jail. But you put bromine, I mean, you know what bromine
[16:00.240 --> 16:06.440]  does to you? Stunts your growth, accelerates your aging, cancer, behavior problems, neurological
[16:06.440 --> 16:11.840]  disorders, IQ reduction, I mean, I drank some Gatorade yesterday just to see cuz it's not
[16:11.840 --> 16:12.840]  out yet.
[16:12.840 --> 16:15.000]  They said it's gonna be out in the next few months. And I was like, that's why it always
[16:15.000 --> 16:19.080]  has that chemical taste. If you drink alcohol, you know what alcohol tastes like, bromine's
[16:19.080 --> 16:26.640]  similar. That's why it's always had that antifreeze taste. Burger King UK reputation damaged by
[16:26.640 --> 16:30.120]  horse meat scandal. You know who used to be the biggest owner of Burger King?
[16:30.120 --> 16:35.760]  They sold it like seven years ago. The Queen of England, one of her company divisions,
[16:35.760 --> 16:42.280]  owned it from the time it was founded. It literally is Burger King. Maybe they groom
[16:42.280 --> 16:46.560]  her stool and then put that in the meat too. I mean, that's a joke, folks. It's Johnny
[16:46.560 --> 16:51.160]  Carson, you know, or I guess that's Letterman.
[16:51.160 --> 16:56.480]  Or maybe he ripped it off from Carson, Johnny Carson. Did you see Kevin Spacey do the Johnny
[16:56.480 --> 17:03.020]  Carson imitation? That was powerful. That was powerful. And then Kevin Spacey made some
[17:03.020 --> 17:09.800]  comment about, well, I'm not gonna get into it, the point is, yep, there you go. So it's
[17:09.800 --> 17:16.100]  like, the giant asteroid may kill us, huh? Let's talk about Johnny Carson now.
[17:16.100 --> 17:20.720]  That's what happens when I take off 24 hours and go swimming, fishing, camping, grilling
[17:20.720 --> 17:28.500]  steaks over an open fire, and shooting a 50-cal BMG. I mean, I put the scope on that sucker.
[17:28.500 --> 17:35.920]  We fired about ten rounds at 300 yards. In ten rounds, we were dead on the target. And
[17:35.920 --> 17:39.280]  we said, hey, let's get out the Reaper now.
[17:39.280 --> 17:52.000]  All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Boy. So that said, everybody's freaking out over the horse
[17:52.000 --> 17:58.320]  meat. You know what you should really be freaking out about? It's this article up at prisonplanet.com
[17:58.320 --> 18:03.320]  and mfoldwars.com from naturalnews.com. And I saw this a few weeks ago just in a medical
[18:03.320 --> 18:09.780]  financial slash journal about, they were doing some press release for stocks for the company
[18:09.780 --> 18:13.240]  about the first GMO vaccine.
[18:13.240 --> 18:16.880]  And I meant to cover it, but here it is. I'm glad they wrote about it, Jonathan Benson
[18:16.880 --> 18:24.360]  did. FDA approves first GMO flu vaccine containing reprogrammed insect virus. That's a great
[18:24.360 --> 18:29.800]  idea because, you see, normally you can't get diseases that most insects have because
[18:29.800 --> 18:34.580]  their biomechanical system, I see them as biomechanical, I know technically they're
[18:34.580 --> 18:37.480]  not biomechanical, but they really are.
[18:37.480 --> 18:45.040]  And with their little exoskeletons, they are reprogramming humans with insects, humans
[18:45.040 --> 18:51.120]  with cows, humans with marsupials, humans with just every plant, animal variety you
[18:51.120 --> 19:02.920]  can imagine. And it then allows the diseases and the susceptibility, this has been proven
[19:02.920 --> 19:09.400]  that a pig had to something that humans didn't or vice versa, now jumps into that species
[19:09.400 --> 19:10.640]  and allows it to jump into you.
[19:10.640 --> 19:16.320]  I mean, this is the type of thing. And they're doing thousands of these things that I know
[19:16.320 --> 19:23.680]  of every year. Well, they have thousands of laboratories doing tens of thousands of things
[19:23.680 --> 19:28.640]  like this per laboratory per year. So see, it's not thousands of things a year, it's
[19:28.640 --> 19:34.520]  hundreds of thousands a year of just giant factories with robot systems, firing with
[19:34.520 --> 19:39.060]  gene guns, splicing everything you can imagine, and then putting it under electron microscopes
[19:39.060 --> 19:44.160]  and putting it in fetal tissue cultures and, hey, let's put it in Pepsi and see what that
[19:44.160 --> 19:49.240]  does. You want to talk about what's probably going to destroy us? It's something like this,
[19:49.240 --> 19:54.400]  not an asteroid. Okay, but an asteroid rates too. But no, we're not worried about that.
[19:54.400 --> 19:59.560]  It's carbon dioxide that plants breathe. Yeah, we need to pay global tax because of that.
[19:59.560 --> 20:00.560]  That's real bad.
[20:00.560 --> 20:05.160]  Attention gardeners and patriots, drought conditions in our nation's heartland and massive Federal

[24:25.820 --> 24:32.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. I am your host, Alex Jones. We're here Monday
[24:32.000 --> 24:40.920]  through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, blasting out on XM166 over 150 AM and FM affiliates.
[24:40.920 --> 24:45.720]  And of course, the audio streams at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. The video streams at
[24:45.720 --> 24:52.960]  infowarsnews.com for the Infowars nightly news. You can also find it at prisonplanet.tv,
[24:52.960 --> 25:01.080]  the original name of our now, what is it, nine or ten years that we've had, prisonplanet.tv.
[25:01.080 --> 25:05.360]  Okay, let me just fire through some of the headlines. I can do this. And then come back
[25:05.360 --> 25:09.680]  in the next segment and drill into the Second Amendment and then the economy. I've got to
[25:09.680 --> 25:21.320]  get to all this. We've also got Bilderberg 2013, Key Intel. So that is coming up as well.
[25:21.320 --> 25:25.920]  What they do when it comes to gun grabbing, I'm gonna cover this in the next segment is
[25:25.920 --> 25:29.420]  they just push and push and push and push and then say, okay, you've won, we're not
[25:29.420 --> 25:30.420]  getting your guns.
[25:30.420 --> 25:34.360]  All right, you won the debate, even though we did win the debate, then they accelerate
[25:34.360 --> 25:38.720]  the next big push. Everybody goes, well, I won. It's kinda like, you know what, you won
[25:38.720 --> 25:43.660]  the fight, buddy, fair and square. I started it, you won, you busted my nose. How about
[25:43.660 --> 25:48.160]  you give me a hand? And then the person shakes your hand, you left, hook them right in the
[25:48.160 --> 25:53.520]  jaw. Or like, you know what, help me up, I'm sorry, you beat me and you throw sand in their
[25:53.520 --> 25:54.520]  eyes.
[25:54.520 --> 25:58.600]  I mean, you've got to understand these are crooks. I mean, as soon as you get that through
[25:58.600 --> 26:02.360]  your head, you understand everything. They see you as a mark and of course they're gonna
[26:02.360 --> 26:08.520]  lie. People think, all the liberals, they mean well, they're just dumb. Yeah, they go
[26:08.520 --> 26:13.220]  to the Senate worth a million dollars and some estimates are she's worth 150 million.
[26:13.220 --> 26:18.560]  People corrected me about Dianne Feinstein, I was using old numbers. I mean, most of them
[26:18.560 --> 26:25.240]  are like that. I'll call her a crook, she's a crook. I don't care if she got a law passed
[26:25.240 --> 26:30.640]  saying that they get a waiver from the Senate Ethics Committee.
[26:30.640 --> 26:36.160]  What if the Senate Ethics Committee gave her a waiver that she could barbecue children
[26:36.160 --> 26:41.240]  on her front lawn? It's like, hey, that woman's got a child on a spit over there rotating
[26:41.240 --> 26:46.000]  them, roasting them, rotisserie. She's got one of its thighs there like a chicken leg,
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.520]  a turkey leg eating it, arrest that woman.
[26:48.520 --> 26:54.240]  No, no, that's a senator, she's above the law. And of course, that's where government
[26:54.240 --> 27:00.960]  will lead, is with Miro roasting children, he actually did that and other things. The
[27:00.960 --> 27:04.320]  Aztecs, the rest of it, I think I said I was gonna get to some of the headlines, didn't
[27:04.320 --> 27:05.320]  I?
[27:05.320 --> 27:17.720]  California announces semi-auto confiscation plan up at infowars.com. And the breathless
[27:17.720 --> 27:22.840]  CBS News is so excited, California, the most populous state is leading the nation. Why,
[27:22.840 --> 27:28.040]  they have a plan to only allow single shot firearms in the state, that's right.
[27:28.040 --> 27:34.120]  Single shot firearms, firearms that only shoot one at a time, and it gets better. Yes, yes,
[27:34.120 --> 27:37.200]  all the people that have the guns that are gonna be illegal, well, they gotta have them
[27:37.200 --> 27:40.440]  in a program to make them turn those in.
[27:40.440 --> 27:45.760]  At last, California will be safe for the defrocked police officer to reportedly run around shooting
[27:45.760 --> 27:53.040]  other people. And then it shows cops all over the street running around with their 308 rifles
[27:53.040 --> 27:59.480]  with, I saw a bunch of them with the silencers on the end, whatever that's needed for.
[27:59.480 --> 28:04.320]  It's not to scare the public or they don't wanna wear earphones themselves, or whatever
[28:04.320 --> 28:08.760]  the reason is. And helicopters, people are like out walking around a woman and a helicopter
[28:08.760 --> 28:11.480]  lands and why are you videotaping me?
[28:11.480 --> 28:17.880]  It's just insane. I've been out in LA quite a bit. I mean, it's like just choppers constantly.
[28:17.880 --> 28:23.880]  Imagine when there's 30,000 drones, they've already budgeted it in last year's FAA funding.
[28:23.880 --> 28:27.840]  30,000 drones, can you imagine what it's gonna be like?
[28:27.840 --> 28:32.400]  I've already got army helicopters flying over my house every day, cuz I live off a creek
[28:32.400 --> 28:38.720]  and I guess they use it to fly off of, as if they don't have all the GPS in there. And
[28:38.720 --> 28:43.160]  it's just constant. And when I tried to get Travis County to not buy another helicopter,
[28:43.160 --> 28:45.120]  it was like $11 million.
[28:45.120 --> 28:49.720]  It flew to my parents' house, because for some reason that was my address that I'd never
[28:49.720 --> 28:54.000]  said is my address, never lived at that house. I was moved out before they moved there. And
[28:54.000 --> 28:59.200]  they came and hovered over the trees. This is like 12 years ago. Now my mom has an iPhone,
[28:59.200 --> 29:00.200]  she would have got it on tape.
[29:00.200 --> 29:05.960]  She comes out, they have the door open on the helicopter they had. They hadn't bought
[29:05.960 --> 29:11.800]  the new ones yet and flipped her off. That is a great idea. You're gonna come flip me
[29:11.800 --> 29:19.400]  off with my taxpayer paid for helicopter, Travis County. You need to go to the right
[29:19.400 --> 29:20.400]  house.
[29:20.400 --> 29:26.360]  Oh, this crazy former cop with his manifesto and all this, who allegedly reportedly looks
[29:26.360 --> 29:33.160]  pretty bad to me. This fits the real MO, not the stage demo. The big Obama supporter, big
[29:33.160 --> 29:38.200]  Piers Morgan supporter. He says, hey, take the citizens' guns. Look at how he's gone
[29:38.200 --> 29:39.200]  haywire right there.
[29:39.200 --> 29:42.960]  And he says he's gonna kill the families, reportedly, of the cops, kinda like you went
[29:42.960 --> 29:47.260]  over and harassed my mom. Is that how your brains work? We'll be right back with a ton
[29:47.260 --> 29:49.740]  of news, the asteroid, the gun grab and more.
[29:49.740 --> 30:00.920]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[31:05.520 --> 31:09.520]  through the year from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer

[33:23.880 --> 33:36.640]  Waging war on corruption. Clashing through the lies and disinformation. I'm Alex Jones,
[33:36.640 --> 33:40.560]  your host. We're going to have open phones today. Let me go ahead and fire the toll free
[33:40.560 --> 33:54.920]  number out for you. It's 800-259-9231 wide open phones on any issue you wish to cover.
[33:54.920 --> 34:00.680]  Okay, let me run through again a bunch of the news here and then I'll get back into
[34:00.680 --> 34:06.440]  the second amendment and then back into the asteroid report that I haven't even gotten
[34:06.440 --> 34:12.840]  to yet with that video that we're going to be breaking down from NASA. And again, it's
[34:12.840 --> 34:15.960]  not that I think this asteroid is going to kill us, it's that it's coming right by the
[34:15.960 --> 34:23.280]  earth and it would, depending on estimates, be about like 100 large hydrogen bombs going
[34:23.280 --> 34:29.960]  off depending on what type of megaton calculation you look at. That's what they're estimating.
[34:29.960 --> 34:35.480]  Would not be, not be nice. Not be nice. It would probably cool the earth's temperature
[34:35.480 --> 34:40.600]  down for a couple decades because it would throw so much dust into the atmosphere that
[34:40.600 --> 34:46.040]  we know that's what happens. And I would not want to be within a couple thousand miles
[34:46.040 --> 34:50.400]  of it either. I mean, it did hit something like, say, New York City. There are no New
[34:50.400 --> 35:03.560]  York City left. And no Maryland left. Baltimore, Maryland, DC, all the way up to Toronto, past
[35:03.560 --> 35:12.880]  Toronto would be in really bad shape, depending on what type of giant asteroid it is.
[35:12.880 --> 35:16.960]  I said that's coming up, so I'm going to be talking about that. We've got some Bilderberg
[35:16.960 --> 35:23.240]  news and more. Don't forget, we've got some new hot t-shirts. And when I say hot t-shirts,
[35:23.240 --> 35:27.520]  they fund our operation and that's important to fund this truly independent pro-liberty,
[35:27.520 --> 35:33.240]  pro-freedom news organization. But expanding on that, we've got the women's pink come and
[35:33.240 --> 35:40.640]  take it, women's style, women's fit. And they do look extremely good on the ladies because
[35:40.640 --> 35:48.120]  I've had a chance to see some ladies now wearing these. And they are very, very form-fitting
[35:48.120 --> 35:49.120]  and they are available.
[35:49.120 --> 35:53.620]  It is the pink AK-47 with the right to keep and bear arms inside of the gun and then come
[35:53.620 --> 35:59.740]  and take it under the Texas style. There's a black one with a white lettering as well.
[35:59.740 --> 36:04.520]  And we also have the come and take it for men in black. And then we have the new Obama
[36:04.520 --> 36:08.640]  Tyrant Joker, a new Joker design. And it's going to be limited edition. We're going to
[36:08.640 --> 36:14.040]  sell it just in 2013. We've brought that back with a new design. And on the back, it has
[36:14.040 --> 36:18.600]  the come and take it, right to keep and bear arms channel, not being French. Best-selling
[36:18.600 --> 36:23.160]  shirt design on the back. And on the front, it has the Obama Tyrant. And your purchase

[37:09.600 --> 37:14.400]  It was already many leagues ahead, but now light years. It's simple. I go out and find

[37:26.360 --> 37:28.360]  or Infowarsstore.com.
[37:28.360 --> 37:38.200]  Okay, let's stop right there. Wow, let me just mention what I've got here that I haven't
[37:38.200 --> 37:48.000]  gotten to yet and then I'll get into the asteroid news and the NASA report. Look at this, the
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.900]  Benghazi thing is really starting to blow up. General on Benghazi, we never received
[37:52.900 --> 37:58.140]  a request for support from the State Department. And of course, the State Department said that
[37:58.140 --> 38:05.840]  they had requested support, but in the hour of the attack, things were bad communication
[38:05.840 --> 38:07.040]  so no one can remember what happened.
[38:07.040 --> 38:10.760]  You can always tell when somebody's lying because it's all vague. Turns out they were
[38:10.760 --> 38:15.080]  never asked, the chairman says he was never asked, the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dempsey,
[38:15.080 --> 38:23.680]  but he's saying I do not blame the State Department. And now we're hearing Panetta said Obama was
[38:23.680 --> 38:28.080]  absent night of Benghazi raid. We've been told he was at the White House and of course
[38:28.080 --> 38:29.640]  would have gotten that special briefing.
[38:29.640 --> 38:33.320]  Let's get Colonel Schaefer on about this immediately, guys. Anthony Schaefer, it's time to get him
[38:33.320 --> 38:38.780]  back on. No word from Hillary during a Benghazi attack. They're now saying that she was out
[38:38.780 --> 38:45.160]  of the live. This is really getting ridiculous. But don't worry, there's a new poll out by
[38:45.160 --> 38:52.280]  Quinnipiac University saying Hillary is the most popular person in America. And then second
[38:52.280 --> 39:00.000]  after that is herpes, gonorrhea, and leeches, and cancer.
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.000]  She even beat out cancer as most popular, it's now number five. I mean, I believe this
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.200]  poll, I believe cancer is the fifth most popular person in America. I mean, you know this poll,
[39:08.200 --> 39:14.240]  I mean, you know everybody loves Hillary Clinton. Everybody loves to turn their guns in. I mean,
[39:14.240 --> 39:20.560]  you know there's a mandate right now, a big mandate, that Republicans should not have
[39:20.560 --> 39:25.040]  any conservatism and turn their guns in, and have totally open borders, and government
[39:25.040 --> 39:26.760]  financed abortion.
[39:26.760 --> 39:34.280]  And the Boy Scouts will all be taught for their first merit badge, how to be gay. And
[39:34.280 --> 39:37.360]  then second merit badge is how to report on your parents' firearms, and I'm not even joking
[39:37.360 --> 39:41.680]  about that. I mean, that's completely normal, that's conservative. And if conservatives
[39:41.680 --> 39:47.520]  wanna be in the game, Karl Rove, American Crossroads has said he agrees with the Democrats
[39:47.520 --> 39:49.200]  and this big hoax they're running.
[39:49.200 --> 39:54.640]  Well, okay, I'm a conspiracy theorist. Hillary is the most popular person in America. I mean,
[39:54.640 --> 40:00.280]  I believe that. I believe that, like I believe jumping off a cliff would be fun, you know?
[40:00.280 --> 40:11.680]  You guys believe that, don't you? Yeah, yeah. Reuters is picking it up. My goodness, they
[40:11.680 --> 40:18.840]  had a poll at this university. What they do, go to a communist studies class or something?
[40:18.840 --> 40:23.280]  Who's your favorite person? That'd be Hillary. You know what, I bet I could go to a Ku Klux
[40:23.280 --> 40:24.860]  Klan rally.
[40:24.860 --> 40:28.400]  You know what, I bet we should do this as a really sick parody, actually find a real
[40:28.400 --> 40:32.040]  Klan rally. Well, last time I went to protest when they threatened to kill me and stuff,
[40:32.040 --> 40:37.240]  maybe it's not a good idea. Anyways, the point is, go ahead and say, yeah, we conducted a
[40:37.240 --> 40:42.680]  poll at the North Woods University, just call it that and go in it.
[40:42.680 --> 40:46.200]  And here's the dean, the Grand Dragon, and here's all his other associates. Who's your
[40:46.200 --> 40:50.980]  favorite person in America? And they'll say, Adolf Hitler. We'll go, well, the university
[40:50.980 --> 41:02.600]  poll finds Adolf Hitler is the most popular person in America. My gosh, it's hilarious.
[41:02.600 --> 41:08.960]  It's hilarious. I'm sorry. Okay, I'm gonna settle down. I've got some serious news to
[41:08.960 --> 41:11.960]  talk about here, but, boy.
[41:11.960 --> 41:19.960]  Anyways, I've been watching all this. As Glenn Beck says, Karl Rove is a fake conservative.
[41:19.960 --> 41:27.840]  Call him me and FreedomWorks and Dick Armey. And then you've got Rove firing back, I'm
[41:27.840 --> 41:33.000]  the real conservative, you're destroying America. Karl Rove, I raised $400 million and got two
[41:33.000 --> 41:38.240]  people elected, and you didn't get anybody elected.
[41:38.240 --> 41:41.840]  And FreedomWorks is like, how dare you? They don't know how to defend themselves. FreedomWorks
[41:41.840 --> 41:45.760]  is not perfect, and I don't really trust Dick Armey, but they actually have done some pretty
[41:45.760 --> 41:49.860]  good things. Even though Glenn Beck's associated with it, I will tell you, it is a lot better
[41:49.860 --> 41:50.860]  than Karl Rove.
[41:50.860 --> 41:58.080]  On the scale of things, like they say in Ghostbusters, imagine paranormal activity, each one of these
[41:58.080 --> 42:03.160]  ghosts being one Twinkie. Well, imagine a Twinkie 80 feet long and weighing about 30
[42:03.160 --> 42:08.440]  tons or whatever they say. He goes, that's a big Twinkie. I mean, I have to use the scattycological
[42:08.440 --> 42:09.680]  stuff, we're talking about Karl Rove.
[42:09.680 --> 42:12.800]  He's really obsessed with that, and all he talks about is poop all day. You didn't know
[42:12.800 --> 42:19.920]  that his nickname is Turd Blossom by George W. Bush. Karl Rove is like a 80 foot long,
[42:19.920 --> 42:26.000]  20 ton turd. And then Glenn Beck, he's like a porta potty that's been at the Super Bowl.
[42:26.000 --> 42:33.560]  It's fully loaded, like a fully loaded baked potato.
[42:33.560 --> 42:42.440]  His estrogen loaded, anyways, I'm sorry. So you got all, I'm sorry, I shouldn't be mean
[42:42.440 --> 42:46.500]  like that. I always just always watch Glenn Beck prancing around, trying to act manly
[42:46.500 --> 42:51.200]  and just the whole thing. Cuz some guys who are really tough try to act gentlemanly and
[42:51.200 --> 42:52.940]  effeminate.
[42:52.940 --> 42:56.960]  It's the opposite of like some British fencer that'll kill you in five seconds and switch
[42:56.960 --> 43:01.580]  your throat, turn into a demon and climb around on top tables, versus people that really are
[43:01.580 --> 43:06.000]  nelly like that. And it's not bad, I mean, it's okay, Glenn. Anyways, the point is, the
[43:06.000 --> 43:08.360]  way his fantasies about me and Charlie Sheen, have you heard those?
[43:08.360 --> 43:13.800]  I'm not joking, constantly on air fantasizes about gay sex and stuff with me and Charlie
[43:13.800 --> 43:17.160]  Sheen. Hey, dude, Charlie likes women. I'm gonna give you a little newsflash. Believe
[43:17.160 --> 43:22.680]  me, I've probably stayed at his house 15 times. Talk about a conspiracy theory. Excuse me,
[43:22.680 --> 43:25.080]  I'm sorry. I'm gonna stop right there.
[43:25.080 --> 43:28.680]  I have now entered the Twilight Zone. I think it's good therapy for me to go out and shoot
[43:28.680 --> 43:35.760]  the 50 cal. My buddy had never shot a 50 cal and he just said, my God, I'm in love, I've
[43:35.760 --> 43:39.240]  gotta have one of these. Well, good luck, the Barrett's are about a year back ordered
[43:39.240 --> 43:41.760]  because the Department of Defense is buying all of them.
[43:41.760 --> 43:46.520]  By the way, guys, will you print me the story from yesterday? Did you know they bought another
[43:46.520 --> 43:54.000]  22 million bullets? It's 22 million, wasn't it? I was just listening to Watson on the
[43:54.000 --> 43:59.240]  air and heard them covering it. Yeah, 22 million more, so he had it all up at something like
[43:59.240 --> 44:06.760]  1.7 billion bullets since November 2011, like 14 months ago. Pretty darn amazing.
[44:06.760 --> 44:13.480]  Yeah, DHS purchases 21.6 million more rounds of ammunition. My brain rounded up, but it's
[44:13.480 --> 44:19.680]  proper to at 21.6. Didn't do too good in school. Don't know much about history. Don't know
[44:19.680 --> 44:25.420]  much about geography. Don't know too much in the books I read, but that would be really
[44:25.420 --> 44:34.680]  good intro music. I had that about 15 years ago. I want Sam Cooke. Don't know much about
[44:34.680 --> 44:39.640]  his story, but I do know that I love you.
[44:39.640 --> 44:48.080]  Man, anyways, getting back, I'm just so happy about the asteroid. It's asteroid time, asteroid
[44:48.080 --> 44:57.680]  party. All right. Man, Richard took me sprinting this morning. He said, Alex, you're swimming
[44:57.680 --> 45:01.620]  two miles a day. You're jogging three, four miles. You're lifting weights and you're getting
[45:01.620 --> 45:02.620]  fatter.
[45:02.620 --> 45:08.680]  And he goes, you put your body into stress mode. You gotta go sprint. And he took me
[45:08.680 --> 45:14.760]  sprinting. And I probably hadn't really sprinted full power since I did one stint of track
[45:14.760 --> 45:20.240]  and when I was a freshman. And it just felt so good to get my hippopotamus. I'm not really
[45:20.240 --> 45:23.280]  that fat when I'm sitting over. I look fat, but the point I'm a little overweight. I lost
[45:23.280 --> 45:27.160]  a lot of weight and quit doing all the young jabbie and now I'm going back to doing it.
[45:27.160 --> 45:30.800]  This is not a morning zoo show. I think I am starting to go a little crazy though, I'm
[45:30.800 --> 45:35.120]  being honest with everybody. Cuz I have just been, I mean, a man can only take so much
[45:35.120 --> 45:40.520]  of this baloney. You know what it is why I'm laughing? It's so ridiculous. A poll put out
[45:40.520 --> 45:46.240]  by some Soviet-style university that Hillary is the most popular person in America, period.
[45:46.240 --> 45:51.480]  Who is the most popular person in America in real polls? Cuz you got real polls. It's
[45:51.480 --> 45:55.360]  the lying ones that give the rest of the bad name. You gotta go off word of mouth common
[45:55.360 --> 46:00.180]  sense and then go look at what the real PR firms are saying to each other and what companies
[46:00.180 --> 46:01.180]  are really targeting.
[46:01.180 --> 46:05.300]  Cuz see, they'll put out anti-gun propaganda while trying to sell you all the gun movies
[46:05.300 --> 46:10.500]  and gun products. You see, it's the same thing. They sell what they want at you if it's propaganda
[46:10.500 --> 46:15.240]  wise. When it comes to selling product for profit, everybody knows that Hillary Clinton's
[46:15.240 --> 46:19.880]  probably got about a 5% approval rating with the general public.
[46:19.880 --> 46:24.920]  Okay, let's just stop right there. You know, the Clintons would never do anything like
[46:24.920 --> 46:32.200]  that. Let's just do this. Let's get into the asteroid right now. Let's go ahead and play
[46:32.200 --> 46:42.920]  this clip on DA14, the asteroid. And this is from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. And
[46:42.920 --> 46:46.720]  they're telling everyone that do not worry, remain calm.
[46:46.720 --> 46:50.640]  Don't worry about all those spaceships you see taking off, all the space shuttles out
[46:50.640 --> 46:55.560]  of underground bunkers. Nevermind, Godzilla just came out of the sea and is attacking
[46:55.560 --> 47:00.480]  Tokyo. Let me see who's calling from an unknown number.
[47:00.480 --> 47:11.640]  Hello? Hey, how are you doing? We still on for that? Okay, so we're not. You wanna do
[47:11.640 --> 47:17.160]  it next week or is that too late? All right, well, I understand. Let me do this. Let me
[47:17.160 --> 47:22.000]  call you back in like three minutes, okay? All right, thanks, bye.
[47:22.000 --> 47:28.600]  Geraldo Rivera had me booked for a Saturday show and then the winter storm hit and everything.
[47:28.600 --> 47:33.760]  So I was gonna have fun going on. How about the Super Bowl and the Illuminati? Too bad,
[47:33.760 --> 47:39.120]  too bad. I was looking forward to that. Because I mean, they were like, yeah, you're right.
[47:39.120 --> 47:42.740]  It was 33 minutes of dark. And yeah, she did do the hand sign. And I'm not gonna explain
[47:42.740 --> 47:45.600]  what it means when the Illuminati, but she does the hand sign and the all seeing eye
[47:45.600 --> 47:48.920]  and then while shoving a microphone into it.
[47:48.920 --> 47:55.920]  So it means something else as well. I didn't even get into that. Okay, you know what? I'm
[47:55.920 --> 47:59.040]  not, you know what's happening? I'm not doing the asteroid justice here and I'm gonna do
[47:59.040 --> 48:03.840]  a serious report on asteroids and then real threats facing us, which asteroids are on
[48:03.840 --> 48:04.840]  the.
[48:04.840 --> 48:13.280]  I should do a top 10 threats from my perspective. I have to go check all the statistics. One
[48:13.280 --> 48:18.520]  of the top 10 threats is, no, no, no. She's one of the top 10 reasons the world's so wonderful.
[48:18.520 --> 48:24.340]  There's a poll out on it. Again, she's number one, cancer is number two is most popular.
[48:24.340 --> 48:30.560]  Heart disease is number three, the most popular person in America. Car wrecks is number four.
[48:30.560 --> 48:36.400]  Brain hemorrhaging and strokes is number five, the most popular person in America.
[48:36.400 --> 48:44.440]  Being run over by a car is number six. Well, I guess having your child die is number seven.
[48:44.440 --> 48:53.640]  I mean, this is stuff that's popular. I guess the SWAT team, SWAT teaming the wrong house
[48:53.640 --> 49:00.840]  and killing your dog, that's number eight. I mean, cuz I could go conduct a poll on that.
[49:00.840 --> 49:05.400]  I could find a select group and do that. Now, what we're gonna do is I'll just take phone
[49:05.400 --> 49:10.720]  calls for a couple segments because that little piece of news sent me off into a bad place
[49:10.720 --> 49:16.320]  mentally, a good place where I don't wanna focus on all this.
[49:16.320 --> 49:19.600]  And then I'll get into the economy and I'll get into the Bilderberg news and I'll get
[49:19.600 --> 49:24.760]  into. Clint Eastwood says if DC doesn't give a damn, how can we? And we're gonna play that
[49:24.760 --> 49:32.400]  clip for you. The princess wife of the communist scumbag running France says she has a Marie
[49:32.400 --> 49:35.480]  Antoinette syndrome of life of luxury.
[49:35.480 --> 49:39.660]  This is a really important article cuz it plays to so many of the bureaucrats and cops
[49:39.660 --> 49:44.780]  and others that think they're God and get this royal attitude. This North Korean dictator
[49:44.780 --> 49:49.760]  type just swaggering. The same look you see in North Korean police, you start to see in
[49:49.760 --> 49:51.720]  big city cop size.
[49:51.720 --> 49:57.540]  And like New York, Chicago, LA, I've seen it. And you see it, you're like, man, that's
[49:57.540 --> 50:04.560]  a bad person. The swagger, the satisfaction, the arrogance. Hi, officer, can you tell me
[50:04.560 --> 50:09.520]  where? And I've done this in New York since it happened to me first, for real. Many times
[50:09.520 --> 50:13.880]  when I'm there, I'll see some police standing around with their hats sideways, smoking cigarettes,
[50:13.880 --> 50:15.520]  stars, bellies hanging out.
[50:15.520 --> 50:20.160]  And they're on duty. You're like, hi, officer, can you tell me where Central Park is? Do
[50:20.160 --> 50:25.080]  I look like a phone book or a directory? Don't you have a smartphone? Where are you from?
[50:25.080 --> 50:30.880]  And if you act scared, they'll go, all right, I'll tell you. Come over here, stupid little
[50:30.880 --> 50:33.920]  monkey boy, and I'll tell you where it's at.
[50:33.920 --> 50:40.840]  But if you actually bow up to them, they'll be like, get over here. Where are you going?
[50:40.840 --> 50:45.280]  And your buddy talks, did I tell you to talk? This is actually on video in Marshall Long.
[50:45.280 --> 50:52.600]  I'm talking to this guy. What, you missed the tough guy? Are you from Texas? You think
[50:52.600 --> 51:00.840]  you're real tough being from down there in Texas? We'll be right back. Ladies and gentlemen.
[51:00.840 --> 51:05.520]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[51:05.520 --> 51:09.500]  through the year from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer
[51:09.500 --> 51:13.040]  drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.

[51:20.800 --> 51:25.320]  of food on hand. Danny from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said,
[51:25.320 --> 51:29.520]  almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my E Foods just in time
[51:29.520 --> 51:31.400]  to be able to help my sister and my niece.
[51:31.400 --> 51:35.680]  Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late. Eat

[54:14.160 --> 54:19.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today. I just want to apologize for talking
[54:19.640 --> 54:25.920]  bad about Hillary Clinton, the most popular person in America. According to a poll, Reuters
[54:25.920 --> 54:34.880]  is carrying it. News flash, news flash, the moon is made of cheese. There's no, look at
[54:34.880 --> 54:40.800]  that smile. Oh my gosh, that woman makes me sick. Get her off the screen. Don't they ever
[54:40.800 --> 54:48.440]  go away? I've been hating this woman for 20 something years. Get out of my life, woman.
[54:48.440 --> 54:55.680]  Go back to hell where you crawled out of. Goodness, and stop feeding us such bull. After
[54:55.680 --> 55:00.640]  I take a bunch of calls and settle down, I will get into the asteroid and it's very serious
[55:00.640 --> 55:04.040]  because it ties into a bunch of other stuff. And the whole policies of the globalists and
[55:04.040 --> 55:09.640]  how nuts they are. They're drinking their own Kool-Aid. And they have Marie Antoinette
[55:09.640 --> 55:15.400]  syndrome. I've said that many times. Now the media is saying it. The economy is so incredibly
[55:15.400 --> 55:22.000]  important. We've got video of the Greeks fighting with each other over food just like Argentina
[55:22.000 --> 55:27.120]  in 2000. And boy, let me tell you, that stuff starts up here. That's why they want the guns
[55:27.120 --> 55:31.460]  now or to demonize the use of guns now ahead of the collapse.
[55:31.460 --> 55:36.200]  That's why government's digging in. Did you notice that this guy shoots three cops and
[55:36.200 --> 55:42.140]  they've got half of California from the middle down, paralyzed, no bike cops from halfway
[55:42.140 --> 55:48.200]  up the state, all the way down to Mexico. No bicycles, no motorcycles. They're even
[55:48.200 --> 55:56.160]  pulling people out of a lot of the cars in total fear when still statistically, I guarantee
[55:56.160 --> 55:59.160]  you cops die every week in California in car wrecks.
[55:59.160 --> 56:04.080]  I mean, I see it all the time in Texas. They die every couple days. And I know it's all
[56:04.080 --> 56:09.480]  sexy like getting shot by a 223 round or whatever the guy's using. Look, they look like 223
[56:09.480 --> 56:13.320]  because of small rifle holes in the windows of their cars. But I mean, they are just,
[56:13.320 --> 56:17.040]  what do you think is gonna happen when the Civil War starts, guys?
[56:17.040 --> 56:22.360]  You know how many Nazis got killed trying to take over different countries? I mean,
[56:22.360 --> 56:26.440]  it was not fun. They ran out of people. And by the way, I'm not saying you're Nazis. I'm
[56:26.440 --> 56:31.360]  saying if you go along with the globalist program and become the authoritarians, I'm
[56:31.360 --> 56:34.640]  explaining this math to you one more time, doing you a favor here.
[56:34.640 --> 56:38.000]  It's like telling your five-year-old, don't play in traffic, tell a two-year-old, don't
[56:38.000 --> 56:44.720]  stick safety pins in the light sockets, honey. Cuz you get the point where your three-year-old
[56:44.720 --> 56:50.080]  is trying to pull the plug protector off and trying to stick something in it. And you go,
[56:50.080 --> 56:53.700]  listen, I got a French bulldog, his name's Sparky.
[56:53.700 --> 56:56.940]  He had this name before he started doing this. I got another one called Captain. He likes
[56:56.940 --> 57:00.520]  to chew the wires. And one time we're asleep, we're about to go to sleep, there's this big
[57:00.520 --> 57:04.840]  white flash in the room. And Sparky had chewed through, this was just last year, through
[57:04.840 --> 57:08.440]  the cord. And it exploded in his mouth, and he just had a little burns.
[57:08.440 --> 57:12.440]  But the point was, it blew the breakers, the power went off, the air conditioner went off,
[57:12.440 --> 57:17.080]  or it would have killed him. But the power instantly went off, so he got a short shock.
[57:17.080 --> 57:20.480]  Did you know he chewed a couple more cords before he really got shocked and finally quit
[57:20.480 --> 57:26.440]  doing it? That dog learned to stop doing it. So I'm gonna tell you something right now
[57:26.440 --> 57:28.680]  as a real friend, okay?
[57:28.680 --> 57:33.160]  Don't chew electrical wires. I know it's a conspiracy theory that there's invisible energy
[57:33.160 --> 57:36.600]  flowing through there. You gotta be able to see it, but I assure you, it's in there. There
[57:36.600 --> 57:43.000]  is electricity in that. And Hillary Clinton is not popular. I mean, I know it's a conspiracy,
[57:43.000 --> 57:44.200]  having your own opinions is a conspiracy.
[57:44.200 --> 57:47.660]  And you must receive what the mainstream media says or your conspiracy theories. You should
[57:47.660 --> 57:52.540]  believe congenital wires. But I promise, I'm not going on a limb here. There are electrons
[57:52.540 --> 57:57.520]  and neurons going through there at high speed, it's called focused power, it's electricity.
[57:57.520 --> 58:02.400]  It's almost like it's particle beams. Electricity is a focus controlled form of particle beam
[58:02.400 --> 58:05.120]  down conductive wiring.
[58:05.120 --> 58:08.800]  That's what electricity is in your house. And you don't wanna chew those electrical
[58:08.800 --> 58:12.760]  cords. Now I wanna tell the police something, okay? The dog didn't understand me, he kept
[58:12.760 --> 58:16.080]  doing it until he finally figured out those little snakes or whatever he thinks they are
[58:16.080 --> 58:18.400]  hurt.
[58:18.400 --> 58:23.160]  You don't want to try to disarm the 160 million gun owners and start harassing us and messing
[58:23.160 --> 58:30.000]  with us and then get a war going. Because if 1% fights back, that's 1.6 million combatants.
[58:30.000 --> 58:36.240]  All they gotta do is go out and bag one cop, disappear, and every cop in America's dead,
[58:36.240 --> 59:06.040]  which we don't want that to happen. We'll be right back.
[59:36.240 --> 01:00:05.320]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:12.320]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:21.640]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:30.120]  All right, we're gonna go to your phone calls. I know you've discovered the new location
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:33.520]  of Bilderberg so early this year, I find it hard to believe, but a lot of evidence pointing
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:34.520]  towards that.
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:38.360]  They're coming for the guns. I see I've kind of got an acclimated to it. Yeah, California
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:42.400]  says they got the most to make you turn in all your semi-autos. It's no big deal though.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.720]  We're conspiracy theorists. We told you that was coming, but it's been proven right, but
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:52.080]  I'm still bad. Let's go to your phone calls. Jonathan in New York, you're on the air. Go
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.080]  ahead.
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.160]  Hey, brother Alex, how you doing, man?
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.200]  I am doing pretty good, Commander.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:04.520]  Nice, nice. Long time listener since 2004. First time caller. I live in New York State,
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:08.280]  and it's just amazing what's happening here. I feel like a black sheep. I've lived here
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:15.200]  for 28 years, and I definitely don't belong politically wise or anything. It's amazing.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:21.720]  My question for you is, you had a rant sometime I think last week about how you don't like
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:26.480]  cowards, women don't like cowards, people don't like cowards. And I want to know, if
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:31.840]  you were able to, that one little rant, put it on YouTube so I'm able to watch it on a
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:35.680]  daily basis and for other people to watch it on a daily basis?
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:40.160]  I don't remember what day it was, and we don't have the crew, the staff, the money to do
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:45.680]  this. But yes, if we took my better little factoid rant nuggets and gave them good names
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:49.880]  and put them on a guy on a rant gallery, they'd be incredibly popular. We just dump stuff
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:58.840]  out in big giant. We do on prisonplanet.tv. Jon Bown takes the better rants and puts them
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:05.640]  up on prisonplanet.tv. Do you remember what day it was, caller, and Jon will get that?
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:10.240]  We should call it Alex Jones, God Hates a Coward, and it would go viral.
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:17.880]  That's perfect. Yeah. Now you have to understand, people that are awake don't like cowards.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:23.040]  Women that are awake like real men, younger women that buy into the sitcom and drama world,
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.360]  they think a wimpy husband and somebody that follows behind them that acts as a butler
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:31.280]  is going to satisfy them. That's why they have divorce after divorce, because men that
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.700]  are told act like fools, act weak, act stupid, act like the guy on the sitcom, you'll get
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:36.700]  all the women.
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:40.360]  And those guys are going, I'm not getting any women or not good women. I'm not finding
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:45.680]  my mate here. I better act even dumber and more nonsensical. Let me tell you, when you're
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:52.000]  focused, confident, and serious, to men out there, you're not gonna have a problem with
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  the ladies.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.680]  I mean, ladies want somebody who's real. Women are just so good. Anyways, getting back to
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:06.640]  what I was saying, it's important, life is just good. And that's why I hate the tyrants.
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:12.480]  I don't like watching something so good and so powerful and so real and so electric, so
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:18.960]  magic being desecrated by gangs of lesser people that gang up together, black, white,
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:23.920]  old, young, you name it, into group identities to then go enslave the rest of us.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:28.000]  And that's what humans do over and over again, the same nightmare, the same Groundhog Day,
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.240]  the same permutation, every group does the same thing. And I'm just like, hey, it's time
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:37.160]  to learn from the past and not repeat it. It's time to take the better examples of our
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:42.460]  better angels, as it was said, and build towards a better future. And then they go, oh, that's
[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:47.200]  how you lose, the cynical fool says, well, yeah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:52.320]  And see, when tyranny is taking over, you can get ahead if you're willing to sell people
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:58.980]  out and stuff for a while. But then all the resources run out, and then the common sense
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:04.280]  gets attacked. If we just make things really evil, then we can thrive. And then they get
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:08.600]  rid of common sense, then they shut down their competition, everything collapses.
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:16.240]  And then they're wondering why everything gets so bad so quick. It's because living
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:20.520]  in a world, liars think that when they lie to their friends, lie to their family, when
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:26.240]  they cheat people, when they screw people, they're getting ahead. And they enjoy it.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:30.360]  It's like I found the secret, I'm winning. And you're not winning. It's like going and
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:36.980]  playing a card game and cheating. What is the point of playing the card game? And they're
[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:42.200]  very unhappy people. These globalists are very unhappy people. They're very, very unhappy
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:47.120]  people. God bless you, sir. I appreciate your call. All right, we're gonna go to Matt, Jeremy,
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:55.120]  John, the Patriot poet, and Wilbur straight ahead. The toll free number to join us 800-259-9231.

[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:27.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Friday edition of the Worldwide
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:37.680]  Transmission. It is the eighth day, the eighth day of February 2013. Coming up in the next
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:41.240]  hour, I'll continue with your calls and a ton of news. In fact, I'm going to take calls
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:47.260]  right now. Then at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to get into shades of Sandy. Drivers
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:54.960]  face long lines at gas stations before another West Coast blizzard. And I wonder if people
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:58.160]  are going to beg for FEMA to show up when they never do, except to take your property
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.160]  in the aftermath.
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:03.240]  Or I wonder if FEMA, like they did in New Jersey and New York, will put up signs saying,
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:10.560]  gone because of storm. Closed because of storm. Wow. Wow. A giant federal agency that gets
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:15.760]  how many billions of dollars a year? Gone for storm. And everybody like begging the
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:19.400]  government to help them. I mean, you got to be self-sufficient or at least try or count
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:24.560]  on your neighbors, folks. Neighbors. That's the millions of people, not the government
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:29.660]  bureaucrats who are too busy strutting around, acting official and powerful.
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:33.160]  Speaking of strutting around, man, I got the news articles I'm going to cover at the bottom
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:41.600]  of the hour. The police in Southern California are shooting up trucks randomly. The reported
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:47.040]  former cop that's gone crazy with these manifestos, if it's real, looks like it is, has the MO
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:53.440]  of something real, has killed three cops, says he'll kill more, burn up his silver truck.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:10:00.400]  So a blue truck of the same make and model. But I mean, there's millions of that truck
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:06.060]  in the US. They shot up two women in a truck, and they're like beating people up and pulling
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:07.120]  them out of cars.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:13.120]  And there's video at infowars.com where this woman or a boyfriend are out in the middle
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:17.640]  of the desert rock pounding, and the helicopter flies around them, and then the helicopter
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:24.520]  lands, why are you filming me? And who are you here? He runs their background, he goes,
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:28.200]  I'm gonna search you now without a warrant and searches them, and then goes and gets
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:32.640]  back in his helicopter and takes off.
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:38.000]  And that was before the murder. Really, I see, I was misunderstanding it cuz I was reading
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.800]  all the comments imagining, cuz this video just came out yesterday. This must be in a
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:47.520]  manhunt. And people think this is so unreasonable. Well, this has to be part of the manhunt.
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:56.320]  It turns out it's not. I mean, that is so incredibly crazy that in America, this video
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.320]  is up at infowars.com.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:04.360]  Now if you're walking around a mile off the highway, something I've done many times, just
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:08.620]  in the middle of the desert, high desert of California, a lot of times I'll just stop
[01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:13.120]  the car. Hey, let's go climb that little knoll over there. Yeah, we can skip some exercise.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:19.560]  And I just cannot imagine the police flying around you in a helicopter and then getting
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.560]  aggressive.
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:26.200]  Don't video me, I'm gonna land. I mean, government has just gone crazy. A video cop lands helicopter
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:31.760]  to harass woman. And then it comes flying right over the top of the hill, really low
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:36.000]  and comes right in and jumps out and ask her what she's up to.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.760]  Is that where our tax money goes? Like each citizen will be assigned a helicopter to follow
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:45.820]  us. Or during the day, we can work at the helicopter bases and serve them and give massages
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:49.800]  to the police and maybe worship them, just like a worship center and we all bow down
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:50.800]  to them.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:55.280]  Okay, I'm sorry. Look, I'm not anti-police, but we know police are bad in North Korea.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.140]  We know police were bad in communist Russia. We know police are bad in Cuba under communism.
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:05.040]  We know they're bad in all these authoritarian states. You know, when you watch an old movie,
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:11.480]  reenacting real things that happened in history with issues in Rome or something, where they
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:15.240]  had the Praetorian enforcers and police and they could just do whatever they wanted or
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:17.840]  rape your daughter if they wanted or take your money if they wanted.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:23.280]  You know, in Mexico, the cops are bad by and large, incredibly bad, incredibly corrupt,
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:28.620]  shaking people down. I remember driving in a Volkswagen when I was like eight years old
[01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:36.160]  in Mexico, rented from Cancun to, I think it was Chichen Itza or something, and driving
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:40.360]  a few hours, stopping eating, and the cops sitting there at a checkpoint and they pull
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:43.200]  up and demand money from my dad.
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:50.000]  And I've seen that done to other people. And that's just what it is. But nowadays, that'll
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.180]  be treason because the image of North Korea's dictator, the image of police, the image of
[01:12:55.180 --> 01:13:00.660]  government is God. It's like an idol. It's like in Raiders of the Lost Ark where he's
[01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:06.460]  got the gold idol at the beginning of the movie and he's running and the bad guy gets
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:09.220]  him and gets the idol and then they do whatever he says because he has the idol and the guy
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:11.820]  holds the idol up and the natives all bow down to it.
[01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:17.060]  That woman should have hit her knees when that helicopter landed. I mean, she should
[01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:21.300]  have hit her knees. No, no, no, no, no. To honor the officer, she should have pulled
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:25.640]  out a knife and slit her throat and said, I offer you blood like the Aztecs did and
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:30.180]  just sprayed her carotid artery blood all over the sand.
[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:39.980]  Guys, isn't that what you should do when a God? Yeah. I mean, if you see a cop and you
[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:43.460]  have a child, you need to carry a blender with you, hooked up, and just cram a baby
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:47.960]  right in it. I give you offering. I'm sorry. No, I mean, that's what governments always
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:55.780]  demand is our children. Every culture ends up demanding human sacrifice of children.
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:14:00.460]  We'll play part of that video later. It's nine minutes long. It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:06.980]  Here's some of the headlines up at Infowars.com. Seattle mayor banned police from using drones.
[01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:09.300]  That's more like it.
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:16.020]  Dems in Colorado moved to hold gun manufacturers liable for shootings. Oh yeah, and now they
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:21.740]  want insurance on gun owners. Imagine if Christopher Dorner, you know what, you got to demand all
[01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:24.260]  knife makers. You got to have insurance to have a knife. And that's where it's going.
[01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:26.980]  The big banks on the insurance companies. They're going to make you get government social
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:30.620]  as healthcare. They're going to make you get more and more in your cars. The price will
[01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:32.940]  go up because they can force you to do it.
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:37.340]  They're going to make you pay to have knives, make you pay to be a parent. They're talking
[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:43.180]  about insurance. Imagine if Christopher Dorner was a Tea Party member. Paul Watson's got
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:47.340]  a key article. I didn't print that. Will you guys print me that? And California announces
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:54.220]  semi-auto confiscation plan. Yeah, all semi-autos to be banned and turned in. Only bolt action
[01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:59.220]  or single shot to be allowed. And then it'll be like other countries, once they ban that,
[01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:01.700]  they always then ban the single shot.
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:05.220]  And they're now trying that in Australia right now while the government goes full auto and
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:12.240]  buys giant armored vehicles. Anyways, 30 year CIA vet talks false flags at Brookings Institute.
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:17.460]  They have a 30 year CIA veteran has gone public, very highly respected, saying our government
[01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:23.180]  staging terror attacks in Africa as a pretext to invade. That's the Brookings Institution.
[01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:28.060]  That's where you go when you're already a double PhD and have already headed some billion
[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:29.900]  dollar company or something.
[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:34.740]  That's all like former secretaries of state, former secretaries of treasury. Doesn't get
[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:39.420]  any more elitist. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts has been the Brookings Institute. That's where
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:43.420]  elites go to really who can't understand it all. Okay, how do I go and understand how
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:44.860]  this really works?
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:48.860]  So it's a public paper they put out where he wrote a paper admitting our government
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:54.180]  staging terror attacks and running Al Qaeda. I mean, can't we just admit what's admitted?
[01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:58.860]  I mean, I'm on Piers Morgan, he goes, you're the guy that says George W Bush did 9-11.
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:06.420]  And I didn't have time to even say no, George W Bush is a complete puppet. If you see the
[01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:13.740]  new hacked photos, he lives in the bathtub, drawing pictures. Obama is an active globalist,
[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:14.780]  but he's not running things.
[01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:17.700]  He goes from meeting to meeting to meeting. It's like the president of a company is usually
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:23.180]  the PR guy who has to go to the golf events and go talk to the little old ladies. And
[01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:31.220]  the PR fan and the CEO and the heads of strategy and the chief technology officers and the
[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:37.020]  futurist board, that's who's running the company. And presidents are, well, I just said they're
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:38.980]  like company presidents.
[01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:46.780]  Does that mean they're like presidents? That's what it's modeled after right there. The president
[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:50.780]  is somebody the Congress likes, the people like, somebody we trust to be the face of
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:55.820]  a war if Congress has to declare it. See, now all of that's being turned around backwards.
[01:16:55.820 --> 01:17:02.100]  And of course, who controlled the Congress until 1913 with the 17th Amendment was the
[01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:08.820]  states, the state legislatures. They ran the show. Davy Crockett didn't do what he was
[01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:14.220]  told in Congress. They called him back. What was it, Tennessee? They called old Davy Crockett
[01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:15.220]  back.
[01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:18.580]  He wouldn't do what they said. Listen, get down here, boy. We sent you up to do what
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:26.380]  we told you. The states controlled the senators. You didn't elect the senator. You elected
[01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:33.900]  your representative who you knew and who you could go visit with. And then he or she, they
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:38.260]  went up there and put the senator in.
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:42.540]  And then you popularly elected the House members. It was all meant to separate power. The most
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:47.260]  separated group were the state legislatures, 20 or 30 of them at the time, depending on
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:52.980]  which period, and then all up there so you don't get a dictator. And then they don't
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:54.840]  even trust the president when this country was set up.
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:58.900]  You don't get to commission officers. The president, if he was a tyrant, like it happened
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:02.540]  in countless other countries, would become a king. And how would he do that? He would
[01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:07.480]  appoint his officer corps. He would go pick men who would bring in a dictatorship for
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:13.060]  him. When the Germans wanted to take over in the mid 1930s in the US, they did the same
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:15.780]  thing they tried in England, where they went and recruited the prince who later became
[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:18.660]  the king, who'd be their puppet king when they took over.
[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:22.220]  They didn't know they'd been double infiltrated. The globalists had actually put them in power
[01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:26.220]  to set them up. They're like, no Nazis, we're not gonna let you take over. See, we put you
[01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:30.420]  in power and you don't even know that because you're arrogant and on power trips and don't
[01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:36.940]  know you've been set up by a British intelligence mind that ran the British Empire.
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:41.300]  Because your arrogance is your undoing, Hitler. You were put in by British intelligence. It's
[01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:47.740]  now been declassified. You moron. Anyways, so they came over here and they went to Smedley
[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:51.700]  Butler, the two-time Congressional Medal of Honor Marine Corps general and a bunch of
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:52.700]  others.
[01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:55.700]  And got them all in big meetings and said, we're gonna make you all basically dictators
[01:18:55.700 --> 01:19:01.540]  and Smedley will make you president if you go along with all this. Because the Nazis
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:06.780]  were like, we like a war hero as the president. How would you like to be the American Fuhrer?
[01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:11.260]  And Prescott Bush here will be your vice president. How does that sound? Why, that just sounds
[01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:14.100]  swell to me, boss.
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:19.020]  And he went and set them up and brought them down. Didn't mean Roosevelt was any better.
[01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:24.940]  He was gonna make deals with Stalin. The point is, is that that's how this stuff works. And
[01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:28.540]  so that's why you have separation of power and government. I haven't gotten to the news.
[01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:31.740]  I'm gonna go to your calls the next segment. We're gonna go to Matt and then we're gonna
[01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:39.500]  go to Patriot poet and Jeremy and John and Dr. Jones. Is that my dad calling? No, that's
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:45.620]  North Carolina. Navy man facing charges. We'll see what he has to say. All of this and more
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:46.620]  straight ahead.
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:50.060]  And then I'll get into the asteroid, I promise, that's gonna pass the closest of any large
[01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:57.140]  asteroid in recent record. And the government says everything's fine, so I'm sure it is.
[01:19:57.140 --> 01:20:00.900]  And a lot more, stay with us.
[01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:05.600]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:09.580]  through the year from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer
[01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:13.820]  drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out
[01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:17.900]  to those that have lost everything. My friends at E Foods Direct hear from customers every
[01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:22.140]  day that are fortunate to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand. Danny
[01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:26.620]  from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, almost all the grocery stores
[01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:30.700]  are closed, but I managed to get my E Foods just in time to be able to help my sister
[01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:34.800]  and my niece. Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early and one day
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:40.900]  too late. Heed Common Sense's warning and do what I've done. Call 800-409-5633 today

[01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:10.300]  60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble. I just created a free video presentation at
[01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:15.660]  123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what
[01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:20.700]  they really are, incompetent line crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to
[01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:26.020]  keep your power bills criminally high. Some have called this a conspiracy. Others have
[01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:31.620]  called it a cover up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:37.260]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them
[01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:42.620]  and how you can beat them too. Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:48.500]  have already seen in the last three months. Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird

[01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:36.780]  and fibers to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:41.020]  at interest, forcing taxes to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when
[01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:44.540]  stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties
[01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:48.220]  of the people than a standing army? Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a silver dollar in a
[01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:54.380]  book explains our monetary system. Call for your copy. 800-686-2237. It's time to understand
[01:22:54.380 --> 01:23:01.780]  the system. Call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237. Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the
[01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:06.540]  bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box. I want you to know some very important
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:12.180]  information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly
[01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:16.940]  to the White House at a time when only the president could obtain this world class healer.
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:22.500]  Now 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:27.560]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:32.700]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:36.900]  normal cell. If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your
[01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:44.060]  critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body. Call 1-866-Venus-Fly
[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:54.660]  or order from Carnivora.com. That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com. That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-Venus-Fly
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:24:14.900]  or visit Carnivora.com. Protect your immune system. It's the only one you've got.
[01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:18.340]  Again, I cannot encourage you enough to go to Infowars.com because there's a ton of news
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:22.860]  we don't get to on the radio that is up on the site, videos, audio. I got to say it's
[01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:29.380]  the best site out there overall for anti-New World Order pro-liberty news. For just general
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:33.980]  fast breaking news and full spectrum, DrudgeReport.com is about as good as it gets. And Drudge carried
[01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:38.300]  our article about 21.6 million more bullets bought by Homeland Security. I'm going to
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:43.500]  be talking about that after calls. But no free man shall ever be debarred the use of
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:50.940]  arms. Thomas Jefferson, we have a great little factoid slash meme. And we put more and more
[01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:56.380]  stuff like that on the front page of prisonplanted.com and Infowars.com. Go and copy that and repost
[01:24:56.380 --> 01:25:00.500]  it to Facebook. There's a reason they've been trying to block stuff like that, because we
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:01.500]  have power.
[01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:10.780]  Just constantly be waking people up, constantly be a porky pig, constantly be the porky pig,
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:17.180]  constantly be a beacon of liberty. It's a propaganda war. We use truth, common sense,
[01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:22.460]  they use lies. Okay, let's go to your calls. Matt in Washington, DC, thank you for holding.
[01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:23.460]  You are on the air, sir.
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:28.240]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. The solution I wanted to bring to the table today
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:33.380]  is food cooperatives. However, as a board director, I can tell you through personal
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:37.820]  experience that food cooperatives are in a battle right now. The old generation of co-op
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:42.380]  hippies from the 60s think that the fight has been won. They think that because organic
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:45.700]  and natural is now mainstream, there's nothing more to fight for.
[01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:50.420]  John Mackey, the founder of Whole Foods, actually came out of co-op. Your listeners know that
[01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:56.140]  organic and natural food became more popular and the integrity of these terms are now being
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:26:00.740]  sacrificed. It's interesting that all the largest organic retailers make up the panel
[01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:05.360]  that determines what can be considered certified organic. Do you think they have the people
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:08.660]  in mind or their stockholders' interests at heart?
[01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:13.060]  Cooperatives are member-owned and operated. It takes volunteer and sacrifice. But people
[01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:17.660]  have a grocery store they own and can vote on decisions to take that power back. I would
[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:21.900]  like to call upon Alex Jones, listeners in the Austin area, to mark your calendars for
[01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:26.820]  June 6th, 7th, and 8th. This is the largest cooperative conference in the country, taking
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:32.620]  place sponsored by the Wheatfield Co-op in Austin, Texas. If you, Alex, and your team
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:35.020]  could get involved in this conference directly or indirectly-
[01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:38.860]  Yeah, it'd be great. Listen, here's the deal. I'm not a big fan of people calling in with
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:44.340]  red statements, because it just sounds so canned. But yes, the globalists, if they can't
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:48.380]  beat it, they join it. So now they're saying you're basically of the devil if you don't
[01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:54.100]  like GMO. And we're not talking about crossing two plants or varieties. We're talking about
[01:26:54.100 --> 01:26:59.300]  putting insect genes in it, you name it. This stuff's deadly. And Whole Foods is just totally
[01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:04.740]  caved in, because they were gonna basically put the guy in jail with SEC stuff on stock
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:07.020]  manipulation or whatever that they were alleging.
[01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:15.180]  So it's very sad. But yes, we need to get away from GMO. I totally agree with you, and
[01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:21.900]  I appreciate your call. Let's go ahead and talk to Patriot Poet in Michigan. You're on
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:22.900]  the air. Go ahead.
[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:23.900]  Mr. Jones.
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:24.900]  Hey, buddy.
[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:30.380]  Hey, what's up, man? Listen, first, I want to compliment you on your absurd video on
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:36.660]  being a snitch for big shits, Janet Dunne video of the pilot dino. That's hilarious.
[01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:41.900]  Which one is that? The one where I am by the part of my grocery store. Yeah. It's like,
[01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:47.180]  I gotta do it for Janet. No, I'm a member of an elite team. Every member of the American
[01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:52.700]  population is now a terrorist. Yeah, that's hilarious. What's that video called? It's
[01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:59.140]  called Snitch society. Alex, there's a, I want to get to my talking points. I just want
[01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:02.940]  to blitz students real quick. There's a video coming. I mean a movie coming out called Snitch
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:07.700]  with that rock guy. It's about his son taking out, his son's got a drug problem, and his
[01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:12.100]  dad takes out an old drug cartel or something. It's called Snitch straight up. They're just
[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:14.100]  coming out with this shit. Snitch. Excuse my-
[01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:17.020]  I got to let you go, buddy. Yeah, I'd love to be able to hear from you, but then we got
[01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:22.020]  to delay you out, and it's like fun to cuss on air, I know, but then we have to delay
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:25.060]  you out, then I just got to let you go. I wanted to be able to hear what you had to
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:29.460]  say, but sorry. Let's go ahead and talk to Jeremy in Texas. You're on the air, sir.
[01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:31.100]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:32.100]  Good, sir.
[01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:38.700]  I've seen all your movies, man. I'm a true-through-yourself. I've done all my work and all this, but I
[01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:44.780]  have a more personal problem I need your help with, maybe. The state of Texas accused me
[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:50.100]  of something that I was ruled out of, and then I was taken to court, and then when I
[01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:54.460]  tried to tell them, they weren't giving me a lawyer or anything, and they- when I tried
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:58.620]  to tell the judge constitutionally there was nothing wrong, they just told me that I had
[01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:05.220]  no rights, I had to shut up, and they actually made 12 guards, forced me out of the courthouse,
[01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:06.220]  onto the streets-
[01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:11.300]  Yeah, sir, judicial tyranny is absolutely insane. They're arresting people everywhere
[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:15.940]  for not vaccinating their children when there's no law. They're arresting people that don't
[01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:20.660]  want their 10-year-old to have an abortion and say no, that they're making churches pay
[01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:25.300]  for abortions. Next, they'll have them in the factories, like at Foxconn and Al Gore's
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:32.940]  Apple system. I mean, I'm sorry, it's just, I mean, I can't help everybody. I mean, you
[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:37.060]  know, the caller's like, come to our Wheatsville co-op, come do our thing. I mean, I'm totally
[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:43.060]  overwhelmed. Yes, we have tyranny coming down on us, and they put people in jail all the
[01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:47.700]  time for things that aren't even in the code, or they use fraudulent code because they've
[01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:50.060]  got kept juries that would put a newborn baby in prison.
[01:29:50.060 --> 01:30:00.660]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:14.100]  globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

[01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:25.540]  kids and one says, do you have asteroids? The video game? Do you have asteroids? No,
[01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:33.020]  but my dad does. We're gonna be, yeah, National Lampoon's, there you go. We're gonna be going
[01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:37.580]  over asteroids, diverse Earth satellite zones, NASA says, coming up here after I take some
[01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:38.580]  more calls.
[01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:42.300]  And again, we don't screen your calls. Sometimes they're great calls. Sometimes they're terrible
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:46.980]  calls. I'm not saying the last callers were terrible. I have people calling here every
[01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:53.060]  day saying the government just took my newborn baby for no reason because I wouldn't take
[01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:58.420]  vaccines. What do I do? Well, I mean, it's totally illegal. There's no law to take it,
[01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:02.020]  but they've got these family courts that are totally criminal.
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:07.660]  And all I can do is say, stand up America. Know a hospital's dangerous. Know your rights.
[01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:12.040]  Have it in the birth plan beforehand that you're not getting vaccines. Know that it's
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:15.500]  not illegal. Know that when they take your kid, they're gonna trick you into agreeing
[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:20.740]  that you were having some type of malfeasance or were neglective.
[01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:24.500]  See they take your kid to get you scared and have you sign papers to give them away. They're
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:30.100]  kidnappers. Well, give me the kid back. You sign the papers. Don't read them, sign it.
[01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:35.020]  I mean, it's knowing crooks have taken over and the crooks are in such power that everybody
[01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:40.340]  just does what they say. The average nurse isn't a crook. They're just sacks of cowardly
[01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:47.140]  follower, TV head, hollow garbage.
[01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:50.220]  I don't like the evil people that know what they're doing, but at least I respect them
[01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:54.660]  cuz I know they've decided to join Satan. And just hug Satan and said, take me straight
[01:34:54.660 --> 01:35:02.580]  to Hades, the fastest express elevator you've got. But the soft, focused on themselves,
[01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:09.060]  lazy fake people that are there, greasing and oiling the sled that we're gonna go down
[01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:10.060]  into hell in.
[01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:14.420]  I don't like you. I don't like your beady eyes. I don't like your cowardly ways. I don't
[01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:19.820]  like your chicken neck. You understand me, you filth? Believe me, I know all about the
[01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:23.860]  times. I know all about what they're doing to people right now. It makes me angry. I
[01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:26.020]  empathize with all these people, okay?
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:30.860]  I can hear and feel their screams. I don't like it. The globalists do though. It's like
[01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:36.980]  music to their ears. You don't like? I don't like nails on a chalkboard. They like it.
[01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:40.780]  You know, a lot of people don't like being beaten with bullwebs, but there are people
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:52.140]  that do. And I gotta go to your calls or I'll never get to them. We're gonna get into the
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:56.420]  reported cop that is running around shooting people and then how the police are involved
[01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:59.660]  in an orgy of violence against the citizens.
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:03.740]  I see the videos of the police in Southern California. And so many of them look like
[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:10.340]  they're angry and feeling sorry for themselves. And it's also real exciting. You got a better
[01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:14.700]  chance of dying driving down the road than you do being shot by this guy. So stop drama
[01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:21.020]  queening and stop shooting up. It's like, they shot up some women who were in a similar
[01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:22.020]  truck.
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:27.980]  Really? Totally different color. Women throwing papers on a paper route out. One woman driving,
[01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:33.060]  other woman throwing papers out. You don't know what that is. And you shoot them. Shoot
[01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:38.060]  one in the head, shoot one in the back. And there's no apologies. There's no, it's like,
[01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:42.340]  well, they're scared. It's like, well, I mean, why not just shoot up a school bus then?
[01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:47.740]  Hey, we're a little concerned right now. Why not have laws rockets and just shoot them
[01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:51.340]  into the nearest school bus? There might be a terrorist on that school bus. Let's just
[01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:56.760]  blow that up. And I'm telling you what it is, the psychology of this is, a lot of these
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:00.940]  cops join the military to be Rambo at first.
[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:07.140]  And again, police join to be police cuz their family have been police. Or because they have
[01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:10.860]  a military background, they don't know what other job to get. And then they join the military
[01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:14.260]  cuz of family reasons or convictions or whatever. There's a lot of good people in the military,
[01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:18.820]  a lot of good police. But the people running the military police are bad. So it doesn't
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:24.420]  matter. You're being used as a tool incrementally to do something that's unconstitutional.
[01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:32.060]  Therefore, you become the problem. And I thought this video I saw where the cop lands the helicopter
[01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:35.300]  out in Southern California in the desert and harasses her and her boyfriend who were just
[01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:41.420]  walking along rock hunting and then frisk him without probable cause. I thought that
[01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:50.140]  was because of this manhunt, it's not. But it's just the attitude of, you know what,
[01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:52.020]  we may shoot you if we feel like it.
[01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:57.940]  Because one guy who joined the Navy and all this anti-terror commando training and he
[01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:03.140]  loves Obama and he loves Biden, this is the alleged guy. And you read his manifesto, it's
[01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:08.300]  just into the childlike mind of these people. I've been around it, I've seen it, I know
[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:13.900]  it. These people are little kids. I watched the Austin police cadets one morning cuz Barton
[01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:15.140]  Springs was closed.
[01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:22.300]  I watched him at Deep Eddy do swim training and about a third of them couldn't swim and
[01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:27.340]  were just fighting and they have to pull them out. The others swam okay and then the quote
[01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:34.100]  commando guys jumped in, go I'll show you how to swim, watch this. And they were not
[01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:38.220]  good swimmers and I'm not somebody who's like Mr. Sports jock tough guy.
[01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:44.780]  But I bet you money, if I randomly pulled up at any park and told 30 guys, hey, come
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:51.020]  over here, we're doing a contest, see who the best swimmer is? I'll guarantee you that
[01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:56.140]  they would be ten times better swimmers. I mean I was freaked out. I was freaked out
[01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:59.660]  watching the police cadets and I went over and talked to some of the cops and they were
[01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:03.620]  coming back up and I go, so are you guys, what is this?
[01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:07.460]  Are you new? You've been accepted as a cadet? Cuz they're like, yeah, we're not new, we're
[01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:12.780]  about to graduate. And they weren't swimming with heavy weights on or something like a
[01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:17.820]  dive class where you gotta go down in the dark and get a master diving and cut your
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:19.500]  way out of things with a knife or whatever.
[01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:23.380]  I mean these guys would all be dead 100 feet down in Lake Travis trying to cut their way
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:29.900]  out of netting. It freaked me out, man. It freaked me out because that's who they want.
[01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:34.300]  They don't want tough guys anymore. They want drones. And I was watching these cops. They
[01:39:34.300 --> 01:39:38.700]  all looked like they were on roids or lifted weights all day and they looked like little
[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:39.700]  kids.
[01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:40.980]  They had the same look in their eye this guy had.
[01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:46.340]  I'm a commando. You have never dealt with anything like you're about to deal for me.
[01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:51.860]  And I will kill your families. And I like Obama and I don't like the gun owners. And
[01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:59.220]  only officers should have guns. And you officers are racist, so I'm gonna kill you, like Django.
[01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:03.620]  You know, they had some machete attacks all over Latin America in movie theaters and stuff
[01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:08.500]  and after movie theater showings in the US. And the media said, no race attacks, Alex,
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:12.640]  after the movie Machete, really, where the Mexicans rise up and kill all the evil white
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:16.000]  people, where all the white people are evil.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.160]  And then you have Django, which I will not go see, but I've read now the public boil
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:24.340]  down of it, that is just designed to create racial tension. And the guy's like, hey, whites
[01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:32.820]  are racist, I'm gonna kill them. And it just totally feeds into this mindlessness of it
[01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:37.980]  all. The discrimination is the bio and chemical weapons in the food and water in the GMO.
[01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:42.580]  The discrimination is insect genes being engineered into new Bill Gates clothing where they force
[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:48.140]  vaccinate you. The real discrimination is having $85 billion a month of tax money added
[01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:53.740]  to derivatives and destroyed to bankrupt us. In fact, I'm gonna go to some of these articles
[01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:55.820]  and then go to your calls cuz I've got to get to this.
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:41:00.140]  Let's go to the economy. We were gonna show Greeks for TV viewers and radio listeners,
[01:41:00.140 --> 01:41:04.780]  I'll describe it, battling like an Argentina 12 years ago over food. They were as wealthy
[01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:10.360]  as we were 12, 13 years ago and overnight had their bankers sign them over to the globalist
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:12.420]  and they bankrupted them by design.
[01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:20.500]  That came out in the IMF World Bank documents one year later in March of 2002. And there
[01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:25.980]  were doctors and lawyers with their families, good looking families, not just like vagabond
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:32.220]  to generally poor people, which is sad as well. A truck had come over with a trailer
[01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:36.780]  with some cows on it, and they were there with scissors and knives hacking out globulates
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:39.260]  of meat, gobbling it.
[01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:43.980]  Try not eating for a couple days, see how you start acting. And Ted Anderson was down
[01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:50.060]  there a decade after it happened on his honeymoon, he got remarried. And he said it was like
[01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:54.060]  people that look like Americans. He said good looking families, said it freaked him out,
[01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:56.020]  he couldn't wait to get out of there.
[01:41:56.020 --> 01:42:02.820]  Good looking families living in doorways and stuff. You'd see a woman with a guy in a sports
[01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:06.700]  jacket shivering in the corner, cuz I've seen the videos on, I know what Doug's talking
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:12.340]  about. And cuz he said it was cold when he was in one particular city. And the kids are
[01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:16.260]  like 12, 13 years old, and he would go and talk to them and find out, yeah, we lost everything.
[01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:20.660]  Yeah, I was a doctor, I was a lawyer, I was a shop owner. I mean, this is what happens,
[01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:22.660]  folks, it will all just implode.
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:26.940]  And the thing is, it doesn't have to happen. They're not gearing up for World War III against
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:30.420]  us cuz they wanna play tiddlywinks. Look at some of these articles. Obama says he will
[01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:35.300]  focus on job creation. He's getting rid of the Jobs Council, which mandates that small
[01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:40.120]  business groups get government contracts.
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:44.840]  It just goes to no bid contract foreign globalist, okay? I mean, this is a sick joke, raising
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:50.660]  payroll taxes, Obamacare, killing business, massive shrinking in GDP, massive shrinkage
[01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:55.940]  in everything. I mean, just designed to bankrupt you, agenda 21. They even admit that in their
[01:42:55.940 --> 01:43:03.180]  policy reports. Here it is, Fed has bought more US debt this year than Treasury has issued.
[01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:10.380]  You understand that? The Fed is buying more debt than was even issued. Unbelievable, I
[01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:19.460]  don't know how that's possible. They bought 16.4327 trillion, that's the national debt.
[01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:27.220]  But notice we've been signed on to 60, excuse me, 1.5 quadrillion, 6,600. I can't even get
[01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:28.980]  these numbers right, they're so big.
[01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:34.420]  The global debt they've signed us on to that's fake is 1.4 quadrillion, no, 1.5 quadrillion.
[01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:44.660]  And so the amount that they've signed us on to is 664 trillion, excuse me. Finally, numbers
[01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:49.100]  like that you just can't say them correctly cuz your mind automatically rounds down because
[01:43:49.100 --> 01:43:50.280]  it can't imagine it.
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:54.180]  So why are we signed on to this and told by the banks we're in debt to them when we've
[01:43:54.180 --> 01:44:01.740]  bailed them out for the 600 plus trill, but our debt is 16.4327 trill. See the math there?
[01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:07.180]  Now, I wanna go to this, this video is up at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com by Max
[01:44:07.180 --> 01:44:11.820]  Slava, wrote a great article about this. It says Greeks fight for food, I never imagined
[01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:13.180]  I would end up here.
[01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:17.960]  The once a bastion of European success at the center of tourism, the country of Greece
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:23.420]  has become the harbinger of things to come for the rest of the world's developed nations.
[01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:29.020]  Images of people struggling to seize bags of tomatoes and leaks thrown from a truck
[01:44:29.020 --> 01:44:32.940]  dominated television triggering a bout of soul searching over the new depths of poverty
[01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:34.180]  and debt laden country.
[01:44:34.180 --> 01:44:39.780]  And again, it's not even their debt. Iceland found out that 97%, it was like 92, 93% of
[01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:46.380]  their debt wasn't theirs. And they went, well, we're just gonna arrest all the banking minister,
[01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:50.180]  the finance minister and these three British banks that run our country. We're just gonna
[01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:54.740]  arrest you. You told us we owed this. And then when you can't arrest us, and England
[01:44:54.740 --> 01:45:00.420]  said the Icelanders were all terrorists, all the entire country, that was in the headlines.
[01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:03.880]  And that their money would be seized and they couldn't travel anywhere and British airlines
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:08.920]  wouldn't fly there and they said fine, fine, we don't owe this.
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:12.540]  And two years later, they've arrested a whole bunch of the bank ministers. Some have already
[01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:16.100]  been convicted and they're in jail. Of course, the bankers that ran them are over in England
[01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:19.900]  and the US and Europe. But they just said, you know what, this isn't our debt. Same number
[01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:22.900]  in Greece, around 90% was not their debt.
[01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:27.940]  Same thing in Ireland. Same thing, they sign us on to their debt and then tell us how we're
[01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:32.140]  deadbeats. And they've had the head of the IMF say the Greeks should work six, seven
[01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:37.900]  days a week. Well, she is exempt from federal global taxes under the EU. That's what it
[01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:41.940]  is at the beginning of the global tax. And see, there's just all this data. That's why
[01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:45.900]  it's impossible to cover this news because there's stories behind every one of these
[01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:47.820]  stories.
[01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:52.620]  And they're gearing up Homeland Security and 1.7 billion bullets and the bunkers and the
[01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:57.260]  checkpoints and the counterterrorism training to target gun owners. Because they're gonna
[01:45:57.260 --> 01:46:02.240]  try to take over and make us pay something in our debt and then raise the taxes. They've
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:06.840]  raised the taxes five times the last two years in Greece, saying each time would pay off
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:07.840]  the debt.
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:10.820]  And then guess what it never does. And then it shuts the economy down more. And then the
[01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:14.660]  hotels close and the businesses close and the factories close. And people are riding
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:19.340]  in the streets with no food. Kids are starving and it's destroying a once beautiful rich
[01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:22.860]  country overnight, destroying confidence.
[01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:25.660]  And Max Keiser a year ago was there during the big demonstrations. He goes over to the
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:30.780]  big hotel and it's Steve Forbes there. And he goes, hey, Max, how you doing? Cuz Max
[01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:34.460]  used to run with the Soros's, all of them. He goes, hey, man, yeah, this is great. Are
[01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:37.260]  you here to invest? We're gonna take over everything. We're pennies on the dollar.
[01:46:37.260 --> 01:46:43.300]  Man, we're gutting this sucker. Max was in Reykjavik a year before the fake implosion
[01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:49.060]  in 2007. Made a BBC doc, no, it was Al Jazeera documentary saying, I was at the bar making
[01:46:49.060 --> 01:46:50.060]  the documentary about it.
[01:46:50.060 --> 01:46:52.540]  And the bankers talked about how they were gonna implode the economy in the next few
[01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:58.880]  years and sign them onto the debt. I mean, this is a plan. And you don't have to be part
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:05.940]  of it. You don't have to go along with it. You don't have to be an idiot. Remember four
[01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:09.280]  years ago, we had to bail the banks out, everybody was so mad.
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:14.420]  It wasn't 880 something billion, that was just the first payment. They signed us on
[01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:19.740]  to an impossible, it'd be like if they change you. A chain you couldn't get off your leg
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:26.300]  to Mount Rushmore and said, now move that. You're not moving the mountain. Godzilla can't
[01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:27.300]  move it, okay?
[01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:32.660]  And he isn't real. All right, a conspiracy theorist, I'm not allowed to have an opinion
[01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:37.420]  or a view. Only government views are real. They say it's real, it is. I'm not allowed
[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:41.660]  to have a view and say Godzilla's not real. I apologize. I forgot, conspiracy theory is
[01:47:41.660 --> 01:47:44.260]  having any original thought in my mind.
[01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:50.920]  Nothing exists outside of government. Thank you, government. I was getting off the path
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:56.740]  there for a moment. I was almost like Ted Knight in Caddyshack going, Billy, Billy,
[01:47:56.740 --> 01:48:02.620]  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy. All right, let's just stop right there. Let's go to this first
[01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:08.140]  clip. But don't worry here, they're gonna have all the food stamps ready, all the FEMA
[01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:09.140]  things.
[01:48:09.140 --> 01:48:12.780]  The government's gonna take care of you after you turn those guns in. Let's go ahead and
[01:48:12.780 --> 01:48:22.100]  go to this video of them fighting over food and grace. Here it is.
[01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:37.340]  It's like about 100 people begging in the back of a truck for food. Yeah, you know what
[01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:40.780]  the austerity program means once they bankrupt you and get you where they want you? It's
[01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:45.860]  more than 100 people, it's about 200. Then they literally do, did you know the movie
[01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:50.660]  Silent Green is actually based on real riot trucks and stuff that have been used in Asia?
[01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:54.860]  Similar things where it shows the cops wearing the football gear and they're like, this crowd's
[01:48:54.860 --> 01:48:55.860]  gonna blow.
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:49:00.740]  When they run out of the soil like you watch, yeah, it's about to happen. I mean, that is
[01:49:00.740 --> 01:49:05.740]  so accurate with Charlton Heston. Can you guys find the Silent Green thing where the
[01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:09.420]  cops are sitting there and they're gonna go, this thing's gonna blow, get ready. This is
[01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:14.460]  their future they have for you and they plan to shut things down until you are eating people.
[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:19.140]  They are actually calling in Europe and here to make you take the dead bodies of people
[01:49:19.140 --> 01:49:23.020]  that die and, quote, turn it into protein. So don't worry, it's gonna be fed into vats
[01:49:23.020 --> 01:49:30.820]  of bacteria, which then are going to poop out a cheese. You think I'm joking, I can
[01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:36.860]  pull up the BBC article. Pull up corpses to be turned into recycled protein and you're
[01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:38.140]  gonna eat corpses.
[01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:43.620]  It's better, Japan government is funding poop that's turned into steaks. Yeah, this is gonna
[01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:47.580]  be great, don't worry, you're gonna enjoy it. This crowd, when they run out of that
[01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:53.180]  Soylent Green, this crowd's gonna blow. Don't worry, there'll be plenty of Soylent Green.
[01:49:53.180 --> 01:49:56.220]  Let's go ahead, I shouldn't laugh about it, she's so sick. Let's go to Clint Eastwood
[01:49:56.220 --> 01:50:05.900]  though, he says if DC doesn't give a bleep, well then why should any of the rest of us?
[01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:09.320]  That's the plan. Here's Clint Eastwood, the extremist.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:14.580]  They were just dismissed and that was the end of it. And that's kind of, it's almost
[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:20.300]  like they don't give a damn. And so if they don't give a damn, why do they expect anybody
[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:30.140]  else to? And obviously, people get complacent and then things really go bad.
[01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:31.140]  That's right.
[01:50:31.140 --> 01:50:33.140]  That was an example though of a Democrat and a Republican.
[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:35.780]  That's kind of Clint Eastwood, absolutely. That's how things go to hell in a handbasket.
[01:50:35.780 --> 01:50:40.300]  And the globalists, it's in the 112 point IMF World Bank plan that got leaked. Joseph
[01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:45.020]  Stichlitz says he didn't do it, wink, wink. And it talks about how they destroy your country.
[01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:48.740]  And I've been screaming since then, this is their plan, put it in my book, The Sentient
[01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:49.740]  to Tyranny.
[01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:53.580]  The transcript, the documents, all of it, and they're going to do this here. This is
[01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:58.660]  their plan, you understand? Now, do we wanna be part of this? I don't think so, your call's
[01:50:58.660 --> 01:51:00.660]  coming up.
[01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:05.200]  Attention gardeners and patriots, drought conditions in our nation's heartland and massive

[01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:05.820]  It's time for a home security quiz. Answer this. What effective home security device
[01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:09.860]  is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your home
[01:52:09.860 --> 01:52:15.060]  while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments
[01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:21.780]  and sells for less than $35? Yes, it's fake TV. This year, about one in every 50 U.S.
[01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:26.900]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that
[01:52:26.900 --> 01:52:31.940]  looks like no one is home. Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look
[01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:37.340]  like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV. It's like a lamp
[01:52:37.340 --> 01:52:42.940]  on a timer, but far more convincing. And for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference
[01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:48.540]  between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked. Go to FakeTV.com or
[01:52:48.540 --> 01:53:01.260]  call 1-877-5FAKETV. That's 877-532-5388. Or go to FakeTV.com. FakeTV, the burglar deterrent.

[01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:41.500]  well, and I've got to get into the Second Amendment and economy news, but I already
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:47.100]  started getting into the economy news. And DHS purchased 21.6 million bullets, more rounds
[01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:51.980]  of ammunition. That's up almost 1.7 billion. TheMightyDrudgeReport.com had that as one
[01:54:51.980 --> 01:54:56.700]  of the featured stories yesterday. Always appreciate helping get that news out, Drudge.
[01:54:56.700 --> 01:55:01.460]  Right now, let's go to your phone calls. Thank you for holding John in Georgia. You are on
[01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:02.460]  the air, sir.
[01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:10.540]  Yes, sir. Mr. Jones, I listened to a dissertation not too long ago. I can't remember what
[01:55:10.540 --> 01:55:18.420]  channel it was on, but they were talking about an internal banking document from 1862 called
[01:55:18.420 --> 01:55:24.620]  the Hazard Circular. And yet, they discussed the value of man and their livelihood. They
[01:55:24.620 --> 01:55:32.860]  discussed chattel slavery versus debt slavery, and how much they profited off of chattel
[01:55:32.860 --> 01:55:38.580]  slavery, which is ownership, versus debt slavery. And they found out that-
[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:41.620]  Now, I'm familiar with that. It's a famous document, yeah. And they found that it's
[01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:45.220]  better for someone to think they're free than be a debt slave because you get it over and
[01:55:45.220 --> 01:55:47.220]  over again.
[01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:52.780]  And it woke me up because I'm a debt slave, pretty much. And I was wondering if you had
[01:55:52.780 --> 01:55:56.140]  time sometime, could you post an article or discuss that?
[01:55:56.140 --> 01:56:00.260]  Yes, I'd forgotten about that particular circular. There's a bunch of those. There's like one
[01:56:00.260 --> 01:56:08.780]  in 1898, where this was published in the Banking Association letter. It was like internal newspapers
[01:56:08.780 --> 01:56:13.660]  just for the Banking Association. I forget the exact note, the National Banking Association.
[01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:17.940]  It was like, Americans are too smart. They're getting uppity. We're gonna take over education.
[01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:21.140]  We're gonna buy the newspapers. We're gonna dumb them down. There was even a book written
[01:56:21.140 --> 01:56:24.100]  on that. It's just amazing stuff, cuz it's the same thing.
[01:56:24.100 --> 01:56:27.740]  The elites communicate with each other. They've got a lot of minions. They've got to get the
[01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:32.100]  game plan out. You can get their playbook. It's just that it's not widely published.
[01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:39.940]  And that's what CFR does. I mean, it's like Brookings Institute or others. Brookings Institute
[01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:44.020]  is as elite as it gets. And they put a big paper out admitting our government staging
[01:56:44.020 --> 01:56:45.700]  the terror attacks and running Al-Qaeda.
[01:56:45.700 --> 01:56:52.980]  I mean, there's a link to it at infoawards.com. They have a senior retired CIA commander,
[01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:57.020]  ran whole operations admitting it, but just saying, you guys need to know this is what's
[01:56:57.020 --> 01:57:01.540]  happening. And it's not because they're even saying get rid of it, it's bad, let's stop.
[01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:06.140]  They always couch it slightly like that. It's, yeah, this is all real. I mean, they've got
[01:57:06.140 --> 01:57:08.580]  to explain that to Brookings Institute people.
[01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:14.380]  I mean, you guys don't know that, you run major companies and stuff. I mean, come on,
[01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:19.180]  this is ridiculous. But I'll get into the MO of the shooter next hour. That is so important
[01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:23.820]  to understand everything. But yes, I'm glad you brought that up. In fact, I wrote it so
[01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:27.660]  bad I can't even read my own writing. What was the name of that circular?
[01:57:27.660 --> 01:57:35.740]  Hazard circular in 1862. And the coincidence to me was that it was the same year that Lincoln
[01:57:35.740 --> 01:57:39.980]  freed the slaves. And to me, I feel like it's tied together.
[01:57:39.980 --> 01:57:45.660]  Well, of course it is. They figured out that, wait, we can even enslave everybody even worse.
[01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:50.580]  But they couldn't hold it back cuz the abolitionists, it's a very complex issue. There's a lot of
[01:57:50.580 --> 01:57:54.180]  stuff going on. Slavery was falling out of favor in the South as well as people figured
[01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:58.940]  out it was being used to leverage out the poor farmers, not the sharecroppers, cuz they
[01:57:58.940 --> 01:58:01.580]  were basically slaves as well.
[01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:04.500]  They could leave if they wanted and go starve to death, that was about it. Well, not if
[01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:08.280]  they signed on, you could be put in prison or killed, but indentured servitude is different
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:13.000]  than that. The point is there's a lot of different variants. But yes, they figured out that just
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:17.480]  get everybody's debt slaves. You're absolutely right. I will pull up the hazard circular.
[01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:22.600]  I think that's online. We'll look into that. God bless you, sir. Great taking calls like

[02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:19.560]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin,
[02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:25.720]  Texas, Alex Jones. All right, let's continue with your calls. I'm getting into this near-Earth
[02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:31.760]  asteroid, one of the closest on recorded record. I mean, it's coming really close. And real
[02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:36.000]  threats that face society and a lot more. Not because we're scared of the threats. We
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:40.040]  want to do something about the threats. But right now, let's talk to Dr. Jones in North
[02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:43.240]  Carolina. Thanks for holding and being patient here on the air.
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:49.000]  Good afternoon. Very quickly, I got in touch with a friend and they got me in touch with
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:55.640]  a family, a young man, 24 years old. His name is Andrew Stevens. He's in the Navy. He was
[02:00:55.640 --> 02:01:00.880]  charged with felony attempt, I think even perhaps murder, but definitely felony child
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:08.080]  abuse. Classic case. The child was three months old, all of a sudden became nauseous, became
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:11.920]  dazed in and out of consciousness. It turned out, of course, the child was damaged from
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:18.200]  vaccines, the two-month vaccines. Here's a family. The wife is in the National Guard.
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:23.200]  I know, I see this all the time. They get a double goody because now the doctors tell
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:27.680]  you, now you may get sick and vomit and have convulsions, but then they arrest you as well
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:33.840]  because they can't say they did it. That's how the eugenics works. Tell me his name.
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:38.240]  The young man's name is Andrew Stevens. He's in jail right now in Newport News. Luckily,
[02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:44.840]  his attorney, a public defender, has an engineering background and has defended seven times people
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:46.920]  charged with shaking baby syndrome.
[02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:51.840]  Oh, I know, because it didn't exist until the vaccine. So their cover story was all
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:56.680]  these babies, it's not that they got the shots today. They either died a few months or 18
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:01.180]  months, they got the shots. But see, the problem is they're so deadly now you have the convulsion
[02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:03.960]  there or in the car and there's no witnesses.
[02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:09.480]  So the cops are like, the cops are just order takers. And they're told when they get back
[02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:14.160]  to the hospital, the hospital goes, the parent did it. Cuz there's inflammation on the brain,
[02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:18.800]  the autoimmune response, and then they send you to jail. I mean, you already brain damaged
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:21.320]  their kid for fun. You wanna put them in jail?
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:26.680]  They're like, yeah, black ops. So yeah, no, I mean, too bad the public's finding out you
[02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:35.920]  won't get to kill more kids. Loving little government. So Andrew Stevens, public defender,
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:37.560]  where is he located?
[02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:42.800]  Newport News. In this case, the baby's alive. But the key was the bleeding started right
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:49.300]  about the neurosurgeon said, 21 days before the baby got to the emergency room, the bleeding
[02:02:49.300 --> 02:02:50.300]  is slow.
[02:02:50.300 --> 02:02:56.080]  So this is the same as the Matthew Ethan case with Louise Woodward way back. The baby,
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:03:00.880]  they don't show any signs, the slow drip bleeding into the brain. And then all of a sudden they
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:07.480]  say it causes damage. The D tap shot causes scurvy, which causes the bleeding. Moreover,
[02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:10.800]  the mother when she was pregnant, she took a T tap shot.
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:15.080]  She also took the flu shot. So again, people have to understand out there, your friends,
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:16.080]  your family, your-
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:20.500]  Listen, listen, listen, they started four years ago. You can pull this up. Doctors now
[02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:25.020]  say it's normal to have a convulsion, your child. Your child's gonna need to shove a
[02:03:25.020 --> 02:03:27.960]  wooden spoon in their mouth. They're gonna flop around, try to bite their tongue off
[02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:30.320]  and they may not talk for a few days.
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:35.600]  Now hopefully you don't figure out we did it so I can put you in jail, honey cakes.
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:42.520]  The government is so corrupt, ladies and gentlemen. So in fact, I just got a confirmed story from
[02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:46.400]  one of my crew that would blow you away. I haven't been authorized to tell the story
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:48.720]  yet cuz I didn't even ask if I could.
[02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:54.320]  Where it doesn't even matter. Look, we're in trouble. You got a class of people that
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:59.680]  think they're Marie Antoinette, who think they're God. And they're lined up to have
[02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:06.240]  an orgy, a political orgy of stealing and grabbing and weirdness. And they feel powerful
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:07.240]  together.
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:11.340]  They feel their arming up against us. They're nuts, they're nuts. And you still got a lot
[02:04:11.340 --> 02:04:15.520]  of good people that work in the system. But they're being spurred on by the corporate
[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:19.680]  interests that want this tyranny. And I'm glad you called in about this, gentlemen.
[02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:23.040]  Sounds like you're trying to help them. Can people, do you have an email so folks can
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:25.000]  rally to you to try to help these folks?
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:29.960]  No, the only contact I have is a public defender, Newport News. The key is people have to realize
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:35.480]  it's gonna happen to your friends, your family. If you don't tell them do not take the vaccines,
[02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:38.200]  you're gonna wake up and say, my brother's perfectly fine.
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:42.800]  He didn't abuse a child. And the jury is gonna think, hey, no babies ever get-
[02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:47.600]  Well, they love putting somebody in prison. They're sycophants. It's good people and sycophants
[02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:51.840]  in this country. You've got to tell people, okay, go ahead and take the shot. But when
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:55.960]  Billy doesn't talk again, they're gonna put you in jail, okay? Now, just okay, they want
[02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:58.480]  to kill your kid. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:05.400]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:10.000]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.680]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:17.240]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[02:05:17.240 --> 02:05:22.800]  on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps
[02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:28.260]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[02:05:28.260 --> 02:05:33.000]  has established an all powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening

[02:08:07.420 --> 02:08:27.680]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. We're about to cover the field, the waterfront when
[02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:33.480]  it comes to key news and information on the economy, on civilization ending threats to
[02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:38.640]  humanity, on huge attacks on the Second Amendment, California introducing legislation to make
[02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:42.980]  all semi auto firearms be turned into the government and it's just a minor footnote
[02:08:42.980 --> 02:08:49.300]  in the news. That's all up at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com. Again, we are a radio transmission
[02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:57.620]  simulcasting video and a full production at infowarsnews.com or prisonplanet.tv. And
[02:08:57.620 --> 02:09:00.580]  I want to spend a few minutes, I've already talked about it some, but I really want to
[02:09:00.580 --> 02:09:04.660]  give you my take on Los Angeles gunman motivated by racism.
[02:09:04.660 --> 02:09:08.640]  They're now saying in London Telegraph and ABC News that there were racist police. That's
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:14.620]  why he has to go out and shoot white officers. And people are saying, well, could it be staged?
[02:09:14.620 --> 02:09:18.580]  They're not going to stage something where somebody is out killing people and then saying
[02:09:18.580 --> 02:09:26.400]  he loves Obama and Biden. If somebody faked these manifestos, they have super advanced
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:31.220]  knowledge that I don't really think very many people have of the mindset of the minion enforcer
[02:09:31.220 --> 02:09:32.220]  class.
[02:09:32.220 --> 02:09:37.000]  Okay, this person deserves a Nobel Prize in literature if it's fake, and it could be.
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:40.780]  It could be. I mean, you never know. They may have killed this guy and this is some
[02:09:40.780 --> 02:09:46.860]  sign off, but it just doesn't. There's dozens of little points that say it's not. And we're
[02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:50.740]  gonna be talking about that. And what does the government think if there's a civil war
[02:09:50.740 --> 02:09:57.100]  and the cops aren't out on motorcycles and they're hiding out with one guy?
[02:09:57.100 --> 02:10:02.940]  In the real world, the guy was to tell cops, gonna kill cops. You just have police ready.
[02:10:02.940 --> 02:10:09.860]  And when somebody gets killed, you vector in on that and get the guy. And he's all your
[02:10:09.860 --> 02:10:14.980]  tabletop exercises won't help you and all this stuff. I mean, he's playing soldier.
[02:10:14.980 --> 02:10:20.980]  He was trained to be a soldier and then to be a cop. And then that didn't work out. So
[02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:25.880]  now he's targeting you. That's why you don't want police who play soldier against the citizens.
[02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:33.560]  Soldiers go and burn down cities and kill the enemy. Soldiers don't become your police,
[02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:36.620]  your peace officers to negotiate the peace.
[02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:42.420]  See it's never between like a, to use a cheesy analogy, a Jedi and a Sith. A Jedi is there
[02:10:42.420 --> 02:10:48.620]  to negotiate things and try to calm things down. Here, don't let this little one bother
[02:10:48.620 --> 02:10:56.460]  you. Let me get you something. I have the death sentence on 12 systems. I mean, you're
[02:10:56.460 --> 02:10:59.160]  trying to not get in a confrontation.
[02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:04.640]  You're trying to de-escalate things, not prove you are Conan the Barbarian rolled into Audie
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:09.020]  Murphy. So you act like Audie Murphy when there's ten times your number of Germans coming
[02:11:09.020 --> 02:11:12.980]  down with a column of trucks and tanks. And then you climb up on a burning tank scene,
[02:11:12.980 --> 02:11:15.540]  you fight other men who are coming to kill you.
[02:11:15.540 --> 02:11:20.940]  You know they're coming to kill you. You know it's a stand up fight. That's another army.
[02:11:20.940 --> 02:11:25.580]  Go be a soldier. You're not a soldier pulling me and my family over and shining lights in
[02:11:25.580 --> 02:11:29.980]  my face. And where you going? What you doing? Go to North Korea if that's what you think
[02:11:29.980 --> 02:11:33.940]  protecting people is, okay? I'm gonna try to explain that to you. All right, I said
[02:11:33.940 --> 02:11:40.340]  I'd get to it and I'm already getting to it.
[02:11:40.340 --> 02:11:46.380]  One of the biggest news stories out there the last few days is this asteroid. An asteroid
[02:11:46.380 --> 02:11:51.780]  half the size of a US football field will pass between Earth and orbiting satellites
[02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:57.100]  next week. Sparing the human race from the fate suffered by dinosaurs, NASA says, we
[02:11:57.100 --> 02:11:59.060]  have a NASA video we're gonna go to in a moment.
[02:11:59.060 --> 02:12:09.060]  The 150 foot diameter asteroid named 2012 DA14 will pass about 17,000 miles above Earth
[02:12:09.060 --> 02:12:15.540]  on February 15th. That sounds far away. That is like grazing us. Lower than the orbit of
[02:12:15.540 --> 02:12:21.480]  some satellites and the closest recorded approach of an object of its size, closest recorded.
[02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:28.340]  It will travel 7.8 kilometers a second or 17,400 miles an hour. See, it's not just that
[02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:35.020]  these big iron or nickel meteorites are deadly because of their size, it's their speed, folks.
[02:12:35.020 --> 02:12:38.780]  Or about eight times the speed of a rifle shot. I'm sorry, I said four times earlier
[02:12:38.780 --> 02:12:45.260]  from memory. NASA scientists said yesterday, no Earth impact is possible. We're gonna play
[02:12:45.260 --> 02:12:50.300]  a clip from a NASA jet propulsion laboratory that does all the computer calculations.
[02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:54.100]  And you know what, I'm sure they're right, okay? The point is that if it was going to
[02:12:54.100 --> 02:12:57.700]  be hitting us, they won't be telling you. They would just know that people are gonna
[02:12:57.700 --> 02:13:05.700]  see it coming in on their telescopes. Most new objects are planets, Kuiper Belt, asteroids,
[02:13:05.700 --> 02:13:08.940]  you name it, are found by amateur astronomers.
[02:13:08.940 --> 02:13:14.180]  Because there are just millions of people now with pretty powerful telescopes, I'm one
[02:13:14.180 --> 02:13:22.000]  of them, who go out and are looking at the night sky and then finding things. So I'm
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:26.020]  not saying this is happening, but if it was, we'd be in trouble. And I've always said,
[02:13:26.020 --> 02:13:33.700]  we need Earth defense. And some have called for this, but not under the UN.
[02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:41.180]  A country like the United States needs to put it out in deep orbit and have a treaty
[02:13:41.180 --> 02:13:46.100]  and maybe have a camera there on it, wiring back so everybody knows it's not a weapon
[02:13:46.100 --> 02:13:50.260]  system. The problem is it violates treaties cuz you can swing it back around and aim it
[02:13:50.260 --> 02:13:52.560]  at the Earth.
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:58.980]  But they've already got that. And I don't normally follow this argument that we've already
[02:13:58.980 --> 02:14:03.980]  got drones, we're already watching you, go ahead and accept that you have no privacy.
[02:14:03.980 --> 02:14:09.260]  See, I don't follow that argument of, okay, we did conquer you, so just sit down and shut
[02:14:09.260 --> 02:14:14.740]  up. A, we're not conquered, our own government can't hold Baghdad cuz it's not our government,
[02:14:14.740 --> 02:14:16.740]  they're a bunch of crooks.
[02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:22.860]  There's many examples, but when I say they've already got space-based weapons, space is
[02:14:22.860 --> 02:14:27.020]  so completely classified. But I've talked to some of the top people involved under Bob
[02:14:27.020 --> 02:14:31.860]  Bowman and others, and it's on record that over 80% of all shuttle operations were classified
[02:14:31.860 --> 02:14:32.860]  military.
[02:14:32.860 --> 02:14:42.340]  They've got particle beams, DU Seibos, smart pebble, brilliant pebble. The only reason
[02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:47.620]  Dr. Bowman could tell me about this is he said that the scientists and the heads of
[02:14:47.620 --> 02:14:52.960]  NASA are so arrogant that he said, I can only tell you this and where it's at because they
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:57.580]  set it on C-SPAN here and they set it there and they violated national security.
[02:14:57.580 --> 02:15:05.120]  But he said in the 1970s, this is at the whole 9-11 event in 2006 in California that was
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:09.020]  on C-SPAN. I'm back there eating lunch with him and everybody's out of the room, nobody
[02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:13.300]  wants to talk to a top rocket scientist, they're all too busy. I wanna talk to Charlie Sheen
[02:15:13.300 --> 02:15:16.540]  and I've got him and I go, look, just tell me, tell me, tell me, I know they got space
[02:15:16.540 --> 02:15:17.540]  planes, black man.
[02:15:17.540 --> 02:15:27.540]  And he said, look, when Star Wars didn't exist, there were robot craft with DU Seibos that
[02:15:27.540 --> 02:15:33.380]  could decapitate all the world leaders on Earth in a matter of hours. And he said, the
[02:15:33.380 --> 02:15:36.900]  only reason I can tell you that is because this person, that person, and this person
[02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:39.940]  all said it separately and he gave me the record of where it was.
[02:15:39.940 --> 02:15:44.860]  And he said, that is as high classified as it gets what I just told you, but I can tell
[02:15:44.860 --> 02:15:50.260]  you it because these idiots, and one of them in a debate with him on C-SPAN, another C-SPAN
[02:15:50.260 --> 02:15:59.060]  show screwed up and said, well, you know that's not true cuz of the ZRQX-9 program. I mean,
[02:15:59.060 --> 02:16:03.300]  and Bowman was there in the late 70s into the early 80s before they even announced it.
[02:16:03.300 --> 02:16:14.220]  I mean, in the 70s they had drone remote control spacecraft with DU meteor guns on board. Can
[02:16:14.220 --> 02:16:20.020]  you imagine what they've got now? See, I mean, you see some article about, I saw one Wednesday
[02:16:20.020 --> 02:16:23.660]  going, yes, in fact, pull it up, it's London Telegraph, you can do it, but I've gotta get
[02:16:23.660 --> 02:16:28.580]  to these videos here.
[02:16:28.580 --> 02:16:32.140]  They're like, yes, the government is gonna install black boxes and all telecommunications
[02:16:32.140 --> 02:16:38.900]  companies to track everything you do in lifetime. They did that 30 years ago. It's in the 96
[02:16:38.900 --> 02:16:43.620]  Telecommunications Act that they upgraded them with $9 billion here. Of course, I knew every
[02:16:43.620 --> 02:16:48.060]  phone company had the NSA in it, and I always said that, and whistleblowers came out and
[02:16:48.060 --> 02:16:51.860]  said, the phone company is the NSA, yes, yes.
[02:16:51.860 --> 02:16:56.540]  The big NSA bases are the spies all dialed in, listening to what you're doing and computer
[02:16:56.540 --> 02:17:05.900]  algorithms and pulling up what you said, there's total recordings of it. I mean, they had 35
[02:17:05.900 --> 02:17:13.100]  years ago, they had robots that could kill every leader on Earth in a matter of hours
[02:17:13.100 --> 02:17:20.100]  with 100 pound SABOs that they fire off the back of a rocket that goes up to 30, 40, 50,000
[02:17:20.100 --> 02:17:23.340]  miles an hour like this meteor.
[02:17:23.340 --> 02:17:28.140]  And it doesn't matter if you're in two miles under a mountain, you're dead. You're dead.
[02:17:28.140 --> 02:17:35.820]  I mean, pinpoint precision right through the rock. You're dead. That's why the globalists
[02:17:35.820 --> 02:17:39.340]  are so arrogant. But here's the deal, globalists, I'm gonna skip this network break, this is
[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:43.700]  so important. I'm gonna give you guys a little newsflash here.
[02:17:43.700 --> 02:17:48.500]  You're not in control of yourselves, man, I can look at top globalists who actually
[02:17:48.500 --> 02:17:54.660]  have power. And you guys are on megalomaniac, narcissistic power trips, loving the sound
[02:17:54.660 --> 02:18:01.660]  of your own voice. And you're not in control of all this stuff. Yeah, you're in control
[02:18:01.660 --> 02:18:07.500]  of us, you ain't in control of yourself, comprende, I mean, does that get across to you?
[02:18:07.500 --> 02:18:15.620]  Go watch Forbidden Planet if you wanna understand, okay? Dr. Morpheus thought he was in control,
[02:18:15.620 --> 02:18:22.740]  he was not in control. And you're not in control, and you better get yourself in control. I
[02:18:22.740 --> 02:18:26.820]  know you're so evil and so dark, you're not. But you're mid-level and high-level people,
[02:18:26.820 --> 02:18:31.500]  look, you know this is going to a bad place, we gotta stop these people.
[02:18:31.500 --> 02:18:35.500]  Come hell or high water, we gotta stop them. Now, let's go ahead and go to the video here
[02:18:35.500 --> 02:18:42.540]  of, and it turns out that, it turns out, ladies and gentlemen, that Space Command has dispatched
[02:18:42.540 --> 02:18:47.700]  a spacecraft and the asteroid is on a collision course with Earth. And that they're hoping
[02:18:47.700 --> 02:18:52.780]  to take it out with some boosters, they're gonna fire at it and have mounted on the side
[02:18:52.780 --> 02:18:53.780]  to direct it away.
[02:18:53.780 --> 02:18:58.580]  But they've gotta get the booster rockets up to the speed to be able to come up against
[02:18:58.580 --> 02:19:04.600]  it at 17,400 miles an hour to land, to then thrust it out away from the Earth. And we've
[02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:24.340]  got live feed of that, we're going to it right now, here it is.
[02:19:24.340 --> 02:19:37.540]  April is coming up. April 1st, joke early. No, no, the asteroid's 17,000 miles away is
[02:19:37.540 --> 02:19:42.020]  where it's gonna pass, and they got all the trajectory and stuff. And I hope they're right
[02:19:42.020 --> 02:19:48.280]  and moving at 17,400 miles an hour and there was Space Command out there dealing with it.
[02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:54.500]  Before that video was even available, before they had video games like that, what was it,
[02:19:54.500 --> 02:20:02.100]  like 1982 or something, asteroids, they had real weapon systems in space, 1979. So the
[02:20:02.100 --> 02:20:09.920]  year that was out, the Pentagon had a bunch of black-mana attack craft in low orbit flying
[02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:12.120]  around with a DU weapons.
[02:20:12.120 --> 02:20:15.660]  Can you imagine what they've got now? Okay, let's go to the real NASA video saying that
[02:20:15.660 --> 02:20:19.060]  there's no threat, no big deal. By the way, my enemies will cut that joke out and say
[02:20:19.060 --> 02:20:23.220]  that actually said the asteroid was gonna kill us, but I don't care, whatever. Okay,
[02:20:23.220 --> 02:20:31.900]  okay, Pookie, go ahead.
[02:20:31.900 --> 02:20:37.500]  Asteroid 2012 DA14 is an object about half the size of a football field in diameter that
[02:20:37.500 --> 02:20:41.900]  is going to pass very close to the Earth on February 15th. Coming from the south to the
[02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:48.340]  north, it actually gets to within 17,200 miles of the Earth's surface and will pass interior
[02:20:48.340 --> 02:20:53.060]  to the geosynchronous satellites and the GPS satellites. But there's really no chance of
[02:20:53.060 --> 02:21:00.100]  the asteroid hitting the Earth and very little chance it will hit a satellite.
[02:21:00.100 --> 02:21:04.180]  Although this object gets very close to the Earth on February 15th, it's fairly small
[02:21:04.180 --> 02:21:05.180]  as asteroids go.
[02:21:05.180 --> 02:21:09.180]  Yeah, I didn't know that Ted Anderson did the voiceovers for the Zippo Ocean Laboratory.
[02:21:09.180 --> 02:21:14.500]  It will be located in Eastern Europe, Asia, Australia, and you know where to look and
[02:21:14.500 --> 02:21:19.060]  you have a pair of binoculars, it will indeed be visible. The asteroid was discovered by
[02:21:19.060 --> 02:21:28.640]  a group of Spanish astronomers in La Sagra Observatory in southern Spain.
[02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:36.020]  An object the size of DA14 actually impacted the Earth on June 30th, 1908, the so-called
[02:21:36.020 --> 02:21:41.500]  Tunguska event. An object of about 30 or 40 meters came down into the Earth's atmosphere
[02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:47.180]  and exploded, leveling trees for 820 square miles.
[02:21:47.180 --> 02:21:53.860]  The close approach of this object, 2012 DA14, on February 15th is nothing to worry about.
[02:21:53.860 --> 02:21:58.620]  Its orbit is very well known, we know exactly where it's going to go, and it cannot hit
[02:21:58.620 --> 02:22:02.500]  the Earth.
[02:22:02.500 --> 02:22:07.380]  Many years ago, we probably wouldn't have found this object, but now NASA is observing
[02:22:07.380 --> 02:22:12.420]  the skies lightly and picking up these objects and we track them for a hundred years into
[02:22:12.420 --> 02:22:16.740]  the future and see if any of them make interesting close Earth approaches, not only because of
[02:22:16.740 --> 02:22:21.980]  the threat issue, but because these objects are important for science, they're important
[02:22:21.980 --> 02:22:25.380]  for future resources, as well as threats.
[02:22:25.380 --> 02:22:31.420]  Okay, so there you go. If you were a radio listener, again, I made the joke that the
[02:22:31.420 --> 02:22:37.540]  asteroid is going to hit the Earth and they'd send a spaceship up to shoot it down. I played
[02:22:37.540 --> 02:22:47.660]  video from the 1979 game. Was it Space Invaders? No, it's Asteroid. Hey, do you have the game
[02:22:47.660 --> 02:22:48.660]  Asteroids?
[02:22:48.660 --> 02:22:54.460]  Do you have the game Asteroids? No, no, no, my dad's got Asteroids. I did the same joke
[02:22:54.460 --> 02:22:59.500]  I did earlier. I actually wrote that joke. And Hillary Clinton, did you see the new poll
[02:22:59.500 --> 02:23:04.820]  up? It says she is the most popular person in America. I think that's true. I don't think
[02:23:04.820 --> 02:23:08.660]  they're lying in these polls sometimes, cuz I'd be a conspiracy theorist.
[02:23:08.660 --> 02:23:13.780]  If you question known certified liars, that is the real definition of a conspiracy theorist.
[02:23:13.780 --> 02:23:18.060]  If you're gullible, do whatever you're told and just sit down and shut up and drink fluoride
[02:23:18.060 --> 02:23:24.280]  water. You're a good person. Okay, let's go to Katherine in Texas. Thank you for joining
[02:23:24.280 --> 02:23:25.280]  us today.
[02:23:25.280 --> 02:23:32.520]  You doing all right? I'm doing all right, Katherine. Well, first of all, just thank
[02:23:32.520 --> 02:23:42.060]  you for showcasing those who uphold the Constitution and exposing those who don't. And also, I
[02:23:42.060 --> 02:23:49.900]  was a teacher here in Texas for almost 20 years and I quit because they are definitely
[02:23:49.900 --> 02:23:53.100]  dumbing down and I did not wanna be part of that anymore.
[02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:58.940]  Yeah, and then it always gets worse and worse and they say, the teaching system, the teaching
[02:23:58.940 --> 02:24:04.820]  system, what are we gonna do? The educational system, it's failing. We need more money,
[02:24:04.820 --> 02:24:09.040]  more federal control and the test scores get worse from the best in the world to the lowest
[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:11.460]  in the industrialized world and then some.
[02:24:11.460 --> 02:24:15.460]  It's like the drug war. The drug war is failing. No, it's not. They keep it illegal to keep
[02:24:15.460 --> 02:24:20.940]  the price high to then be able to fill the prisons with people who use drugs who are
[02:24:20.940 --> 02:24:25.940]  non-violent, who they're now going to decriminalize and let out and put political people in the
[02:24:25.940 --> 02:24:29.820]  prisons. See, the new prison boom is gonna be for gun owners.
[02:24:29.820 --> 02:24:36.620]  Yeah, I mean, I believe that. That's another thing is, when you were on Piers Morgan, well,
[02:24:36.620 --> 02:24:42.580]  you just pretty jump started that dialogue on the Second Amendment and what's the attacks
[02:24:42.580 --> 02:24:43.580]  on it.
[02:24:43.580 --> 02:24:49.700]  I mean, I think that really woke people up. I mean, that's just me. But going back to
[02:24:49.700 --> 02:24:56.280]  that education, and then there's a former president's brother that wants to push this
[02:24:56.280 --> 02:25:03.980]  computer program and have that masquerade as some type of education. Kids need direct
[02:25:03.980 --> 02:25:05.820]  learning from a human being.
[02:25:05.820 --> 02:25:09.760]  Look, when they tried to get rid of phonics, that should have told people it was happening.
[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:13.060]  My grandmother was a teacher. She was even one of the peers with a PhD or whatever it
[02:25:13.060 --> 02:25:18.660]  is, yeah, the PhD. And she taught in public schools and she just was like, it's dumbing
[02:25:18.660 --> 02:25:20.180]  them down, it doesn't work.
[02:25:20.180 --> 02:25:24.220]  And she would secretly still teach them the old stuff that worked. That's why they're
[02:25:24.220 --> 02:25:29.020]  all going to computers where you don't have a choice. See, and it's not that I'm against
[02:25:29.020 --> 02:25:34.480]  computers, computers could be good. It's that they're perfect for tyrants to centralize them.
[02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:40.680]  I'm for computers, but we don't want computers where they put a robot that spies on everything
[02:25:40.680 --> 02:25:45.260]  you do in your phone, in your computer, or on the side of your house as a smart meter.
[02:25:45.260 --> 02:25:53.020]  Yeah, oh, yeah, don't even go there. Yeah, well, you know, and also I wanted to touch
[02:25:53.020 --> 02:25:58.300]  on this program they have, it's called Seascope that they're using here in Texas. I worked
[02:25:58.300 --> 02:26:02.260]  in a school district where a person thought, I guess he thought he was doing okay, he was
[02:26:02.260 --> 02:26:07.260]  the principal. He wanted to absolutely get rid of all the textbooks and just have a Seascope.
[02:26:07.260 --> 02:26:12.340]  And you were talking one time when you deal with these people, these neoliberals or whatever
[02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:18.820]  that are doing this, they're kind of nasty people. Well, whenever you would call the
[02:26:18.820 --> 02:26:24.060]  region office and say, hey, there's a big mistake here in this and they didn't like
[02:26:24.060 --> 02:26:29.140]  that, you know, well, oh, wow, you just teach it anyway, you know, or something. Yeah, I
[02:26:29.140 --> 02:26:34.180]  mean, it's just ridiculous. And I really appreciate you having that Charlotte Iserbit on there.
[02:26:34.180 --> 02:26:41.820]  She's awesome. You know, I'll tell you what's crazy is more and more the average people
[02:26:41.820 --> 02:26:45.180]  can't even talk or read. It's like they're not even real. They're like TV heads that
[02:26:45.180 --> 02:26:50.380]  just just shuffle around. God bless you, Catherine. Good to hear from you. Julie in California,
[02:26:50.380 --> 02:26:53.820]  you're on the air, military helicopters over your home. Go ahead.
[02:26:53.820 --> 02:26:59.500]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, last night, you know, with all this deal with this guy running around,
[02:26:59.500 --> 02:27:06.820]  it was about 1115. We had an actual military jet. I was two miles from probably one of
[02:27:06.820 --> 02:27:11.140]  the busiest general aviation airports in the country, Van Nuys Airport. There are no flights
[02:27:11.140 --> 02:27:18.420]  that take off out of there after 10 o'clock at night. 1115 this jet came flying over.
[02:27:18.420 --> 02:27:22.460]  And I mean, it literally woke myself, my husband and my son out of a dead sleep.
[02:27:22.460 --> 02:27:27.340]  Well, maybe the trip should blow off some steam and bomb your house like that B-2 did
[02:27:27.340 --> 02:27:31.260]  a few years ago. A couple houses got bombed. I mean, look, they're shooting up women's
[02:27:31.260 --> 02:27:36.100]  cars just because it's the same make and model, not the same color. But it's like, it's OK.
[02:27:36.100 --> 02:27:40.740]  It's a silver car. That was bright blue. Shoot it up. That one's yellow. But sir, it's silver.
[02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:47.140]  It's fire. So I think those women should apologize for the police shooting him. Kind of like
[02:27:47.140 --> 02:27:52.460]  when Cheney shot the gun, he apologized to him. I think I think they should apologize
[02:27:52.460 --> 02:28:00.540]  to the police. Don't you know, I don't because, you know, I mean, I think we had the helicopters.
[02:28:00.540 --> 02:28:07.340]  But these women were shot at 50 times. I mean, how in the world do you miss? I mean, how
[02:28:07.340 --> 02:28:15.100]  do you mistake a blue Toyota for a blue Nissan that doesn't have a hold on?
[02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:20.420]  Are you trying to like have common sense and say that two different colors and that it
[02:28:20.420 --> 02:28:25.620]  was wrong that they did that? That's you. Are you a conspiracy theorist? They also shot
[02:28:25.620 --> 02:28:33.820]  a black Honda truck. Oh, right. Three shots right to the right of the driver. I didn't
[02:28:33.820 --> 02:28:37.340]  know about that. Oh, they're having another orgy. OK, well, we'll see. What's going to
[02:28:37.340 --> 02:28:41.300]  happen is I'm talking about the break. I'm going to get to it in a moment. I have to
[02:28:41.300 --> 02:28:45.020]  really conform my thoughts here because I've got a bunch of them, a bunch of points on
[02:28:45.020 --> 02:28:46.020]  this issue.
[02:28:46.020 --> 02:28:49.540]  But Paul Craig Roberts, Paul Craig Roberts, former head of the Treasury Department and
[02:28:49.540 --> 02:28:57.340]  Policy is up on Infowars.com with another one of his articles. It has happened here.
[02:28:57.340 --> 02:29:01.720]  And he explains, look, the police state isn't coming. It's here. I heard of that before.
[02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:06.020]  That's the tagline for police state for the rise of FEMA. It ain't coming. Martial law
[02:29:06.020 --> 02:29:11.580]  isn't coming. All over the country, police have anti gang checkpoints. And yeah, there
[02:29:11.580 --> 02:29:15.300]  are gangs. There are dangerous people. Sure, they may do some good with it. It doesn't
[02:29:15.300 --> 02:29:16.300]  matter.
[02:29:16.300 --> 02:29:20.660]  The feds are directing it with grants to get over the Fourth Amendment. The federal government
[02:29:20.660 --> 02:29:26.700]  gives grants if the police will run warrantless checkpoints just to get them used to it. And
[02:29:26.700 --> 02:29:30.660]  you know, hey, cops, we know where the gang bangers are selling drugs. I'll be happy to
[02:29:30.660 --> 02:29:35.180]  take you there. I mean, I can tell a drug dealer about it. Of course, they can, too.
[02:29:35.180 --> 02:29:39.380]  They're ordered where to go look for drug dealers. Why don't you go look at the local
[02:29:39.380 --> 02:29:45.540]  Wells Fargo or Wachovia or any of the other big banks. They've all, on record, been caught
[02:29:45.540 --> 02:29:49.780]  laundering billions a month in narcotics money and owning the aircraft with the drugs on
[02:29:49.780 --> 02:29:50.780]  board.

[02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:25.620]  available at info wars dot com. This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing

[02:33:01.940 --> 02:33:07.700]  You walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future, not a future that
[02:33:07.700 --> 02:33:14.900]  will be but one that might be. This is not a new world, it is simply an extension of
[02:33:14.900 --> 02:33:20.220]  what began in the old one. It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted
[02:33:20.220 --> 02:33:25.700]  the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time. It
[02:33:25.700 --> 02:33:31.580]  has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction
[02:33:31.580 --> 02:33:37.780]  of human freedom. But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one
[02:33:37.780 --> 02:33:57.340]  iron rule. Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace. The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're
[02:33:57.340 --> 02:34:04.340]  listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:04.340 --> 02:34:15.020]  Alright, we are back live ladies and gentlemen and I will continue with Eric Smedley, Kathy,
[02:34:15.020 --> 02:34:21.300]  Brian, Jeremy and others. You know if I had another son, I'd name him something like Smedley
[02:34:21.300 --> 02:34:28.500]  or Buck or something. We thought we were going to have another baby but Lord's will it didn't
[02:34:28.500 --> 02:34:35.540]  happen but we would have named him Buck if it was a boy. Anyways, I do have one son,
[02:34:35.540 --> 02:34:37.140]  I have two great daughters.
[02:34:37.140 --> 02:34:43.620]  Okay, let me just get back into the news here. I've got to get to Bilderberg 2013, secret
[02:34:43.620 --> 02:34:50.140]  location uncovered. I want to get into this police officer. Again, I shot a video about
[02:34:50.140 --> 02:34:54.020]  this last night but now we know more about the guy, anti-terrorism training, all of this
[02:34:54.020 --> 02:34:59.260]  and I'm not saying he absolutely did it but reading the manifestos, there's two of them,
[02:34:59.260 --> 02:35:03.320]  looking at it all, looking at how the police are acting, how he's a big Obama supporter.
[02:35:03.320 --> 02:35:11.980]  That's the last false flag they've run and there's a lot of factors there that fit into
[02:35:11.980 --> 02:35:18.900]  it being accurate and real. Things like Aurora, I mean I saw an LA Times article attacking
[02:35:18.900 --> 02:35:24.780]  me and it was like, the crazies believe the government was funding him. What was it, $30,000,000
[02:35:24.780 --> 02:35:29.940]  with a Department of Defense grant in brain machine interface?
[02:35:29.940 --> 02:35:35.860]  A top Air Force psychiatrist who'd been over whole secret programs assigned to him, witnesses
[02:35:35.860 --> 02:35:40.900]  reporting multiple flashbangs, different sides, on and on and on. See, I could have spent
[02:35:40.900 --> 02:35:45.340]  hours on that article today. In fact, I sent it to Rob Do in an IM. I may do a special
[02:35:45.340 --> 02:35:49.100]  report tonight for the Nightly News, just on that subject.
[02:35:49.100 --> 02:35:54.380]  Because the LA Times says we're claiming all this stuff and then their headline's a lie.
[02:35:54.380 --> 02:36:02.320]  Conspiracy theorist posing as shooting victims and then later it says, one police officer
[02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:10.060]  said they might even be posing as. But they run the headline like it's happening and then
[02:36:10.060 --> 02:36:12.340]  act like I'm doing it.
[02:36:12.340 --> 02:36:16.420]  And I guess the average idiot gets out the LA Times, breaks it open. All right, let's
[02:36:16.420 --> 02:36:23.020]  read all these dirty people posing as victims. Let me read here, Alex Jones, that crazy person.
[02:36:23.020 --> 02:36:28.300]  He says the government was giving the guy money. How ridiculous is that?
[02:36:28.300 --> 02:36:32.540]  But we did find the Soylent Green clip and I'm gonna get to that in a minute. But first
[02:36:32.540 --> 02:36:40.340]  off, this is out of the Journal of Nature. And I've seen this report, no exaggeration,
[02:36:40.340 --> 02:36:45.220]  reading the news intently every day for at least 17 years. Probably 50 times, but that's
[02:36:45.220 --> 02:36:47.740]  just a dead reckoning.
[02:36:47.740 --> 02:36:51.620]  Because this discovery is made over and over again, a similar discovery. We have a document
[02:36:51.620 --> 02:36:58.340]  cam shot on this. Small molecule drug drives cancer cells to suicide. And they found they
[02:36:58.340 --> 02:37:02.300]  can put all different sorts of different types of pellets of different drugs, different chemicals,
[02:37:02.300 --> 02:37:09.180]  you name it, in cancers and knock them out almost all the time.
[02:37:09.180 --> 02:37:12.460]  And my issue is, it's like Raiders of the Lost Ark at the end, where there's that big
[02:37:12.460 --> 02:37:16.580]  warehouse of all the stuff they're keeping secret. I mean, it is amazing. I'm not saying
[02:37:16.580 --> 02:37:21.260]  they have 100% cures, but they've got a cocktail of things from all the scientists I've talked
[02:37:21.260 --> 02:37:25.700]  to in my own research that are so much better than chemotherapy and all the rest of this.
[02:37:25.700 --> 02:37:32.060]  I mean, Linus Pauling, he got the Nobel Prize in the early 60s for knocking out cancer in
[02:37:32.060 --> 02:37:39.620]  almost every case if you caught it early enough with mega dosages of vitamin C.
[02:37:39.620 --> 02:37:44.340]  And that's a treatment by alternative groups, but people almost always go to them after
[02:37:44.340 --> 02:37:50.920]  they've had the chemotherapy, after they've already, it's amazing. Now, that said, this
[02:37:50.920 --> 02:37:56.020]  ties into a plug here. This was of course in Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal carried
[02:37:56.020 --> 02:37:57.020]  it.
[02:37:57.020 --> 02:38:02.140]  International, that's mfowarshealth.com, announces result of longevity clinical research studies
[02:38:02.140 --> 02:38:06.940]  performed by Clemson University Institute of Nutraceutical Research. We covered this
[02:38:06.940 --> 02:38:12.220]  last week, but they found beyond tangy tangerine, and by the way, people that don't wanna have
[02:38:12.220 --> 02:38:19.220]  to get it in the liquid, the healthy start pack is now in pill form.
[02:38:19.220 --> 02:38:24.980]  The Alex pack is now in pill form discounted at mfowarshealth.com or mfowarseteam.com,
[02:38:24.980 --> 02:38:33.060]  I should add that. But this is Clemson University with beyond tangy tangerine and ultimate classic,
[02:38:33.060 --> 02:38:38.340]  where it didn't hurt the regular cells in the colon of cancerous colons, but knocked
[02:38:38.340 --> 02:38:41.500]  out the cancer.
[02:38:41.500 --> 02:38:47.620]  It killed 95% the ultimate classic of cancerous colon cells, and 65% of cancerous liver cells,
[02:38:47.620 --> 02:38:52.900]  65% of cancerous stomach cells, and 30% of cancerous breast cells beyond tangy tangerine
[02:38:52.900 --> 02:38:58.060]  kills 60% of cancerous colon cells, 65% of cancerous liver stomach cells, and 30% of
[02:38:58.060 --> 02:38:59.060]  cancerous breast cells.
[02:38:59.060 --> 02:39:04.860]  I mean, that's Clemson saying that. And people like, you can't say something did something
[02:39:04.860 --> 02:39:09.380]  with cancer, here's another study, Journal of Nature, that's Clemson. They put this cancer
[02:39:09.380 --> 02:39:13.660]  researchers have pinned down a molecule that can kickstart the body's own tumor destroying
[02:39:13.660 --> 02:39:18.820]  systems, makes your body see it as outside and eat it, triggering cell death and cancerous,
[02:39:18.820 --> 02:39:23.540]  but not healthy tissue in mice. And that's great, because even if it metastasizes, they
[02:39:23.540 --> 02:39:28.340]  just put these particles in there and it goes to the cancer, it's like an antibiotic for
[02:39:28.340 --> 02:39:31.380]  cancer, and it'll get shelved and disappear as well.
[02:39:31.380 --> 02:39:36.640]  A lot of other great products, root beer belly, great probiotic that is better than others
[02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:40.980]  because it's encapsulated and goes through the stomach acid into the gut, amazing. That's
[02:39:40.980 --> 02:39:47.980]  all it is for is health.com. The triple chocolate treat, natural gluten free, dairy free, and
[02:39:47.980 --> 02:39:52.500]  it's just got all of these amazing vitamins and minerals and the essence of blueberries
[02:39:52.500 --> 02:39:55.320]  in it and a bunch of other stuff.

[02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:20.740]  on the Infowars team, can answer all of your questions right there.

[02:40:25.220 --> 02:40:32.420]  info, full catalog videos, all there at Infowarshealth.com or Infowarsteam.com. Okay, now let's shift
[02:40:32.420 --> 02:40:37.940]  gears here back into something I covered a little bit last hour, and that is Fed has
[02:40:37.940 --> 02:40:41.680]  bought more US government debt this year than Treasury's issued.
[02:40:41.680 --> 02:40:48.520]  That's called monetizing debt, not a good thing. That is out of CNS news. Watch Greeks
[02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:53.260]  fight for food. Hundreds of people just begging at the back of a food truck because a few
[02:40:53.260 --> 02:40:57.780]  potatoes fell out and sent them into a piranha-like frenzy. This happens everywhere, and it's
[02:40:57.780 --> 02:41:03.000]  so painful to see a once very wealthy nation destroyed by design being signed on to the
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:07.060]  derivatives that wasn't their debt and their taxes raised four times in the last few years
[02:41:07.060 --> 02:41:12.380]  to an impossible level. And the IMF ordering them all to work at least six days a week
[02:41:12.380 --> 02:41:18.580]  or 55 hours to pay for the IMF and World Bank's own debt they signed them on to.
[02:41:18.580 --> 02:41:21.660]  It's like putting a ball and chain on your leg and go, now pay me for that ball and chain
[02:41:21.660 --> 02:41:28.500]  I just put on your leg. It's just horrible. And Obama says he will focus on job creation.
[02:41:28.500 --> 02:41:35.480]  Well, he said he quit torturing too. Remember a year ago, the media said it was a conspiracy
[02:41:35.480 --> 02:41:39.140]  theory that they bought 600 million bullets, and I was wrong to talk about it. And then
[02:41:39.140 --> 02:41:42.620]  a few months ago, it was a conspiracy, 1.6 billion hadn't been bought, even though it
[02:41:42.620 --> 02:41:43.620]  had been bought.
[02:41:43.620 --> 02:41:48.860]  Well, now it's all over the news. DHS has purchased another 21.16 million more rounds
[02:41:48.860 --> 02:41:54.100]  of ammunition. So the total altogether is close to 1.7 billion. That's enough to wage
[02:41:54.100 --> 02:42:00.940]  a 30-year major war if you count Vietnam standards. And it violates your Geneva Convention. They're
[02:42:00.940 --> 02:42:07.520]  buying hollow.40, hollow.223. You don't really need that with 223, just newsflash.
[02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:12.580]  It already fragments, okay? That's what I learned while they liked that bullet. It's
[02:42:12.580 --> 02:42:18.880]  very deadly. And then you've got, of course, the 308. So their Geneva Convention says you
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:21.900]  can't go in and torture people, but they still do it.
[02:42:21.900 --> 02:42:26.660]  Now that said, I wanted to play you from Soylent Green that's actually a pro-eugenics film.
[02:42:26.660 --> 02:42:31.340]  It's got euthanasia in it, a world state, the oceans have died. And I wanted to point
[02:42:31.340 --> 02:42:35.140]  out the asteroids aren't the threat. They could put some space-based systems in there
[02:42:35.140 --> 02:42:38.700]  to take them out because they don't think the big ones hit, but every few million years,
[02:42:38.700 --> 02:42:40.020]  but maybe that's wrong.
[02:42:40.020 --> 02:42:45.540]  Comparatively, though, they've got articles out today where they've reprogrammed FDA approved
[02:42:45.540 --> 02:42:50.980]  first GMO flu vaccine containing reprogrammed insect virus. And I see stuff like this every
[02:42:50.980 --> 02:42:55.980]  day. They've got cows that are part human, pigs that are part human, cows that are part
[02:42:55.980 --> 02:42:59.120]  spider and human and part orangutan.
[02:42:59.120 --> 02:43:03.140]  And there are just farms all over the world doing this, monkeys you could buy 15 years
[02:43:03.140 --> 02:43:10.660]  ago that have jellyfish genes in their back so their backs glow blue, like a blade runner
[02:43:10.660 --> 02:43:17.380]  you can buy in Hong Kong. I mean, we're living in Buck Rogers land. And the leader on power
[02:43:17.380 --> 02:43:22.260]  trips deciding they don't need us anymore cuz they've already got live extension technologies.
[02:43:22.260 --> 02:43:25.980]  They've got, don't believe me, they got it. Are they immortal? No, they got it though.
[02:43:25.980 --> 02:43:30.300]  Can they still die in a car wreck? Yes. That's why they want us all sequestered, put into
[02:43:30.300 --> 02:43:35.920]  compact cities to be exterminated once that's in place because the future is theirs.
[02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:42.620]  The world is theirs. The future belongs to them. Yeah, Obama's slogan, we own the future.
[02:43:42.620 --> 02:43:48.500]  That's a little joke on everybody. So I thought I would show you this Rockefeller Foundation
[02:43:48.500 --> 02:43:54.660]  connected great film, but you should see it to understand the dystopic idea they're selling
[02:43:54.660 --> 02:43:57.940]  you where you will be starved, but they won't be starved.
[02:43:57.940 --> 02:44:03.020]  And I figured out they want stuff to get out of hand. They want all these bio weapons to
[02:44:03.020 --> 02:44:07.960]  get out. They want things, they publish the mousepox that kills 90 plus percent of humans
[02:44:07.960 --> 02:44:12.360]  that come in contact with it. They publish how to make it. It's very easy. A mid level
[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:15.220]  microbiologist with a few hundred thousand dollars could do it.
[02:44:15.220 --> 02:44:19.980]  They want this to happen. They want to let others do it. And then they're gonna use those
[02:44:19.980 --> 02:44:23.440]  first outbreaks to put in a compact clamp down system. And then they're gonna bring
[02:44:23.440 --> 02:44:29.940]  even greater control in after that. So let's go ahead now and go to a clip.
[02:44:29.940 --> 02:44:40.540]  And I'll narrate this for radio listeners. Looks like Greece, looks like Argentina. You've
[02:44:40.540 --> 02:44:45.260]  got a government food allotment. Government does that just so they can have control of
[02:44:45.260 --> 02:44:50.100]  you with the Soylent Green that's really made out of people. And again, things are so horrible
[02:44:50.100 --> 02:44:55.820]  they offered to basically pay to have you commit suicide by lethal injection during
[02:44:55.820 --> 02:44:59.580]  a pleasurable experience. Everything's designed to be as ugly as possible, so you want to
[02:44:59.580 --> 02:45:06.840]  commit suicide. Soylent greens everybody likes because it actually has protein in it. All
[02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:11.340]  the other stuff is just basic filler and artificial vitamins.
[02:45:11.340 --> 02:45:20.620]  Yeah, the woman's mad. The cops know a woman angry will trigger the men. Very well done
[02:45:20.620 --> 02:45:24.020]  movie. That's why the government wants the women to be friends with the government. They
[02:45:24.020 --> 02:45:27.620]  know women demanding men take action will get men to take action.
[02:45:27.620 --> 02:45:32.140]  Here's the cops about to talk to each other. Charlton Heston and the other guy about the
[02:45:32.140 --> 02:45:37.460]  crowd about the blows run out of Soylent Green. Looks like real video from Greece we just
[02:45:37.460 --> 02:45:44.860]  saw. There's the assassin sent to kill Charlton Heston. Here we go. They're running out of
[02:45:44.860 --> 02:45:53.700]  the damn green. Idiot. Some foul up a transport. This crowd will blow. I know. Got the scoop
[02:45:53.700 --> 02:45:57.620]  standing by, but I don't know if they can even handle this. When you're going to make
[02:45:57.620 --> 02:46:03.620]  the announcement. As soon as I get up the nerve about five minutes, I guess better pass
[02:46:03.620 --> 02:46:10.420]  the word, right? And they bring in and they actually have this in real crowd control plans
[02:46:10.420 --> 02:46:16.220]  and things like planopolis. They're going to send him giant scoops with bulldozers and
[02:46:16.220 --> 02:46:23.220]  just dump you into big cages. I'm asking you to disperse the supply of Soylent Green has
[02:46:23.220 --> 02:46:31.220]  been exhausted. You must evacuate the area. The scoops are on their way. The scoops are
[02:46:31.220 --> 02:46:54.220]  on their way. I repeat, the scoops are on their way. What do you think is going to happen?
[02:46:54.220 --> 02:46:55.220]  I mean, the Greeks pretty much all have gardens here in the city. Media tells us they're all
[02:46:55.220 --> 02:47:01.220]  lazy. When they implode our economy, they're going to say we're all lazy taxes. And then
[02:47:01.220 --> 02:47:04.220]  when the lazy rioters do riot, if the welfare food gets cut off, they're going to take everybody's
[02:47:04.220 --> 02:47:12.220]  rights during the crisis. There's the bulldozers, bulldozers on the front of trash trucks to
[02:47:12.220 --> 02:47:19.220]  then drop the people in and then the cage door closes on them. This is in real crowd
[02:47:19.220 --> 02:47:23.220]  control management programs. Look it up. This movie was very well researched with a lot
[02:47:23.220 --> 02:47:28.220]  of people. This is what they're planning on doing. They've been selling the dystopic future
[02:47:28.220 --> 02:47:36.220]  for a long time. So you expect all of this to happen. You expect this. And now they've
[02:47:36.220 --> 02:47:41.220]  come out major universities looking up and said that they want to get people's bodies
[02:47:41.220 --> 02:47:46.220]  and recycle it into bacteria that then release the proteins. You're not eating the dead body.
[02:47:46.220 --> 02:47:49.220]  They spin it. You're eating the byproduct of that. They're also coming out with new
[02:47:49.220 --> 02:47:54.220]  steaks made out of feces. Don't believe me? Just type poop steaks in. And again, this
[02:47:54.220 --> 02:47:59.220]  is what they're up to. Telling you that you need to break down society. See with our population,
[02:47:59.220 --> 02:48:04.220]  if they cut the population, then you can't produce for the rest of the population. You
[02:48:04.220 --> 02:48:10.220]  have to have a stable population growing at about 2% a year. But if you don't do that,
[02:48:10.220 --> 02:48:13.220]  that's in major actuaries. We've got that guy coming on next week, one of the top scientists
[02:48:13.220 --> 02:48:20.220]  on it. Then society implodes like Japan, like Italy, like Greece, where they have 1.3 children.
[02:48:20.220 --> 02:48:29.220]  But they're lying saying a larger population would cause an unsustainability. And of course,
[02:48:29.220 --> 02:48:38.220]  everyone's had their guns taken except government assassins. All right, that's good. Now there's
[02:48:38.220 --> 02:48:45.220]  a footage of what's going on in Greece right now. People begging for food, begging for
[02:48:45.220 --> 02:48:54.220]  food and it isn't coming. The scoops are on the way. The scoops are on the way. Man, talk
[02:48:54.220 --> 02:48:58.220]  about a big bug. This new thing in video is like you have a giant bug covering the entire,
[02:48:58.220 --> 02:49:03.220]  can't you have a small bug on there? It's just ridiculous. All righty then, let's give
[02:49:03.220 --> 02:49:05.220]  you some Bilderberg news.
[02:49:05.220 --> 02:49:09.220]  We've got an interesting vet suicide story somebody wants to tell us about. We got Kathy.
[02:49:09.220 --> 02:49:15.220]  We got Eric, wants to talk about Constitution solutions. And we got a brother's kid got
[02:49:15.220 --> 02:49:19.220]  suspended for potato gun. Notice how they put toy guns all over the store, but then
[02:49:19.220 --> 02:49:22.220]  your kid's playing with it, the cops come in your front yard. And they just do this
[02:49:22.220 --> 02:49:31.220]  to act like it's bad, act like it's evil. This is just what the system does now. I mean,
[02:49:31.220 --> 02:49:36.220]  now you'll just see cop cars parked outside shooting ranges. But I talked to one range
[02:49:36.220 --> 02:49:37.220]  owner, they don't even ask him to be there.
[02:49:37.220 --> 02:49:42.220]  It's like, go keep an eye on those gun owners. To create the perception we're criminals,
[02:49:42.220 --> 02:49:46.220]  when on average everybody knows gun owners are one of the most law abiding groups out
[02:49:46.220 --> 02:49:50.220]  there. And see, they're gonna use this guy, even though they don't think they staged it,
[02:49:50.220 --> 02:49:55.220]  this cop killer guy, reported cop killer, alleged cop killer, to demonize military police.
[02:49:55.220 --> 02:50:01.480]  New show Founding Fathers, finally got to see an episode of it. It's a Afghan vet who's
[02:50:01.480 --> 02:50:07.620]  been turned to Al-Qaeda, and he's secretly recruiting the militia to overthrow America,
[02:50:07.620 --> 02:50:08.620]  fooling them.
[02:50:08.620 --> 02:50:12.220]  Now, remember, all the internal stuff said it, we're gonna, this is five years, four
[02:50:12.220 --> 02:50:17.100]  years ago, three years ago, two years ago. The new West Point reports last year, and
[02:50:17.100 --> 02:50:20.940]  now there's a new one this year, that the Tea Party would join with Al-Qaeda. And people
[02:50:20.940 --> 02:50:26.340]  said, how are they gonna sell the public that the Tea Party, who's totally Islamophobic,
[02:50:26.340 --> 02:50:27.500]  would ever join Al-Qaeda?
[02:50:27.500 --> 02:50:32.460]  Well, the show's all about how the pro-gun guy's really Al-Qaeda, and he's a white guy,
[02:50:32.460 --> 02:50:36.460]  you know, blonde hair, blue eyes. That's who they say the new Al-Qaeda is. And see, that's
[02:50:36.460 --> 02:50:42.460]  what they say about me, they say, I'm really Al-Qaeda. Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, that's why
[02:50:42.460 --> 02:50:46.480]  I don't support using Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria, and you've got the CIA at Brookings
[02:50:46.480 --> 02:50:51.460]  admitting they're running Al-Qaeda and staging stuff right now. It's admitted if you just,
[02:50:51.460 --> 02:50:56.220]  they know you don't read books, they, so they just communicate publicly. Yeah, we run Al-Kadavils,
[02:50:56.220 --> 02:51:01.700]  everything's good. I mean, it's amazing.
[02:51:01.700 --> 02:51:06.780]  Food storage, check. Survival tools, check. Weapons and water filters, check. But what

[02:54:51.420 --> 02:54:56.760]  can hear, can't you? Everybody knows we're in trouble, everybody knows we've got crooks
[02:54:56.760 --> 02:55:01.340]  running things. Stop playing games like we don't. I was just talking to Melissa Melton,
[02:55:01.340 --> 02:55:05.300]  she said, oh yeah, this thing about Hillary's the most popular woman in America, that is
[02:55:05.300 --> 02:55:12.020]  like such PR. It'd be like, hey, you know, Michael Jackson's the most popular man in
[02:55:12.020 --> 02:55:15.940]  America a day after he's caught, you know, reportedly in a pedophile. Well, that's true
[02:55:15.940 --> 02:55:20.060]  or not. The point is, I mean, it's like, hey, did you hear, gonorrhea's now the most popular
[02:55:20.060 --> 02:55:21.580]  person in America?
[02:55:21.580 --> 02:55:26.020]  That's her name, gonorrhea, is that the pre-name, name your child that? And she said it was
[02:55:26.020 --> 02:55:30.700]  on CNN, they paraded her out her last day, it was just, it was reportedly on CNN, she's
[02:55:30.700 --> 02:55:35.140]  the most popular person in America. And she's so, everyone loves her. What do you do in
[02:55:35.140 --> 02:55:38.700]  the face of being involved in Benghazi and being caught covering it up and ordering an
[02:55:38.700 --> 02:55:39.980]  eight-hour stand down?
[02:55:39.980 --> 02:55:46.180]  Well, you announced you're the most important person, most loved person in America. I mean,
[02:55:46.180 --> 02:55:52.020]  it's like Al Gore saying I invented the Internet, that video's on YouTube. Yes, I invented the
[02:55:52.020 --> 02:55:59.340]  Internet. I mean, it's okay, then I'm just gonna, I'm gonna announce, folks, I created
[02:55:59.340 --> 02:56:00.340]  everything.
[02:56:00.340 --> 02:56:03.860]  I don't wanna be blasphemous to even say the joke, it'd be like saying I am God. Well,
[02:56:03.860 --> 02:56:11.940]  he says he's God. I mean, are you saying Al Gore is a liar? Again, top stories up at info
[02:56:11.940 --> 02:56:16.220]  wars.com. I'm gonna do 20 minutes, 30 minutes overdrive into the fourth hour of the show.
[02:56:16.220 --> 02:56:22.220]  We should start doing the whole fourth hour live here. And go to Eric and Kathy and Smedley
[02:56:22.220 --> 02:56:31.380]  and Brian and Jeremy, who are patiently holding, we will get to you.
[02:56:31.380 --> 02:56:35.100]  But you know what? You'd think I'd be going after Piers Morgan right now when the guy
[02:56:35.100 --> 02:56:38.660]  in his manifesto talked about how much he loved Piers Morgan. Can I have a document
[02:56:38.660 --> 02:56:45.420]  cam shot please for TV viewers? This is directly from the Associated Press right here, snippets
[02:56:45.420 --> 02:56:51.540]  of it, where he talked about how much he loved Obama, how he loved, absolutely loves Joe
[02:56:51.540 --> 02:56:52.540]  Biden.
[02:56:52.540 --> 02:56:58.620]  He thinks he's such a real guy, talking about falling for bad actors. And the police are
[02:56:58.620 --> 02:57:02.860]  racist so they've gotta be dealt with, and saying he saw cops kick people in the face.
[02:57:02.860 --> 02:57:08.780]  Well, then you're a big guy, invite them to a boxing match for it, or report what they
[02:57:08.780 --> 02:57:14.060]  did, or go public to the media. You don't then kill random patrol white police because
[02:57:14.060 --> 02:57:21.100]  of that. You don't then randomly say I'm gonna kill cops' families, and then the cops, it
[02:57:21.100 --> 02:57:23.740]  just shows what a sick culture it's become in places like LA.
[02:57:23.740 --> 02:57:28.520]  The cops have now, she said another card shot up. Will you guys look up, police shoot up
[02:57:28.520 --> 02:57:32.620]  another car, cuz that'll be the headline that they did. They shoot up women on a paper route
[02:57:32.620 --> 02:57:38.620]  in a different color car, and they're just harassing everyone and completely insane?
[02:57:38.620 --> 02:57:43.220]  I mean, just such entitlement, because the public deserves this. I watch the public around
[02:57:43.220 --> 02:57:52.820]  police, and they literally bow down and get scared and have a response and grovel. Because
[02:57:52.820 --> 02:57:57.940]  you have the predator response. Well, I'm not having the predator response of flight.
[02:57:57.940 --> 02:58:01.960]  Now I try to control myself and go, that's probably a nice officer, probably a nice person.
[02:58:01.960 --> 02:58:05.700]  I don't have a, that's an animal that wants to hurt my family response. I'm not saying
[02:58:05.700 --> 02:58:08.940]  cops are animals, I'm saying a grizzly bear just walked over the hill, what am I gonna
[02:58:08.940 --> 02:58:13.500]  do? But our founders said, treat government like a grizzly bear.
[02:58:13.500 --> 02:58:22.980]  You see, but look, Piers Morgan, the guy hates the NRA, loves Piers Morgan, and says, Wayne
[02:58:22.980 --> 02:58:29.460]  LaPierre, you vile piece of inhuman bleeper, you never even showed 30 seconds of empathy.
[02:58:29.460 --> 02:58:35.700]  Fate being manipulated, more guns means more children safe. I mean, this is just incredible,
[02:58:35.700 --> 02:58:39.140]  absolutely incredible. We'll be right back.

[02:59:17.460 --> 02:59:21.540]  are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister
[02:59:21.540 --> 02:59:25.640]  and my niece. Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early and one day

[03:00:21.420 --> 03:00:36.060]  Alex Jones. This guy going crazy out in California does not help the gun grabber program because
[03:00:36.060 --> 03:00:40.140]  he's been former military who was also a cop. That's why they're trying to focus on his
[03:00:40.140 --> 03:00:43.940]  military service because they want to demonize the military because that's a group they don't
[03:00:43.940 --> 03:00:50.260]  control. Not the police. I'm going to get more into this after your calls. That's why
[03:00:50.260 --> 03:00:53.980]  I'm going into overdrive is to take your calls and cover this. But right now let's go to
[03:00:53.980 --> 03:00:59.900]  your phone calls. We're going to get to Eric and then I promise I'm going to go to Kathy
[03:00:59.900 --> 03:01:04.260]  next in the next segment. I want to hear her story. So stay with us, please, Kathy. Eric
[03:01:04.260 --> 03:01:07.140]  in New Mexico, you're on the air. Thank you, sir.
[03:01:07.140 --> 03:01:15.540]  Oh, thank you for having me. First time caller, long time listener. Um, hey, that's sure am
[03:01:15.540 --> 03:01:28.580]  brother. Oh, hello. Hello. Okay. My, well, the reason I was calling is because I understand
[03:01:28.580 --> 03:01:31.980]  what's going on around the world and everything and all that. And then here in the United
[03:01:31.980 --> 03:01:38.260]  States, it's just basically everybody's pushing against us being the constitution and everything
[03:01:38.260 --> 03:01:45.380]  cars that be, um, is it time for like people to basically stop paying their taxes? I mean,
[03:01:45.380 --> 03:01:48.540]  well I have to say that everybody's got to choose their battles. I won't give people
[03:01:48.540 --> 03:01:53.540]  individual, uh, I'm not gonna tell individuals what I think they should do. Generally try
[03:01:53.540 --> 03:01:58.340]  to eat organic, try to grow your own garden, try to get to no good people. Stop caring
[03:01:58.340 --> 03:02:02.540]  what the system thinks. Stop caring. If you don't have a million dollars in the bank,
[03:02:02.540 --> 03:02:04.700]  stop feeling inadequate.
[03:02:04.700 --> 03:02:08.580]  Get right with God. Get right with your husband and wife. Get right with your children. Get
[03:02:08.580 --> 03:02:13.220]  right with your parents. Try to lay down old grudges with people that, you know, really
[03:02:13.220 --> 03:02:17.160]  don't deserve it. Try to come together and really focus on the global. This is the main
[03:02:17.160 --> 03:02:25.440]  threat and try to expose them every way you can. But yes, if I didn't have 49 crew members
[03:02:25.440 --> 03:02:31.440]  and five or six contractors and I wasn't shooting, you know, doing this battle, I would not be
[03:02:31.440 --> 03:02:33.180]  paying any of these taxes.
[03:02:33.180 --> 03:02:38.740]  The Federal Reserve tax or the income tax 1913 total fraud doesn't go to run the country
[03:02:38.740 --> 03:02:43.820]  designed to put us into debt. The power to tax is the power to destroy. And I would be
[03:02:43.820 --> 03:02:49.860]  trying to do the paperless thing or I do like the illegals do. I'd get fake IDs and fake
[03:02:49.860 --> 03:02:54.860]  names and just live off the grid. So a lot of folks try to live off the grid, but then
[03:02:54.860 --> 03:02:56.540]  they do it completely off the grid.
[03:02:56.540 --> 03:03:01.920]  No, just, you know, go change your name to Juan Gonzalez. I'm serious. Get Mexican plates.
[03:03:01.920 --> 03:03:07.620]  And that's the end of it. And because that's not even bashing the illegals. I mean, that's
[03:03:07.620 --> 03:03:11.420]  that's what they do. Why not? You know, the globalists do that. The globalists to give
[03:03:11.420 --> 03:03:13.920]  themselves diplomatic community.
[03:03:13.920 --> 03:03:17.300]  So I would do whatever you can not to help the system, not to give it anything. But but
[03:03:17.300 --> 03:03:22.060]  more than that, when you see a cop strutting around down the street, staring at people
[03:03:22.060 --> 03:03:27.380]  pull over and go, hey, officer. And if he bows up to you, you know, say, why are you
[03:03:27.380 --> 03:03:28.380]  acting so tough?
[03:03:28.380 --> 03:03:33.180]  Why are you why are you stomping around like you're God? You look like a fool. And if he
[03:03:33.180 --> 03:03:37.460]  does something to you, give me your ID. Go wait a minute. I made first contact. I came
[03:03:37.460 --> 03:03:41.380]  over here and talk to you. Why are you acting like I mean, if you saw a regular guy walking
[03:03:41.380 --> 03:03:46.860]  along going looking at people, you go, what a what a weirdo.
[03:03:46.860 --> 03:03:51.560]  But a cop does it. Oh, man, that's really good. And look, most police don't like guys
[03:03:51.560 --> 03:03:55.740]  like that either. The problem is they're trying to only have those type of guys on the force
[03:03:55.740 --> 03:04:01.620]  now. And again, I've seen the same look at white cops, black cops. It doesn't matter
[03:04:01.620 --> 03:04:08.780]  that we see in the eyes and the M.O. of this gentleman out in out in California.
[03:04:08.780 --> 03:04:13.260]  Can you imagine if Christopher Dorner was a Tea Party member? I mean, it would be the
[03:04:13.260 --> 03:04:19.420]  end of the world if this guy was a Tea Party or see, it fits the script. If it was a Tea
[03:04:19.420 --> 03:04:23.900]  Party or black guy, that'd be even better for him to demonize, you know, two groups
[03:04:23.900 --> 03:04:24.900]  at once.
[03:04:24.900 --> 03:04:28.860]  Well, wait, military. And then in fact, he was black. They would demonize. But again,
[03:04:28.860 --> 03:04:32.700]  it doesn't fit the script to have the cop, because that's it's not they care about cops.
[03:04:32.700 --> 03:04:37.740]  They want that to be off record. Can't question that, because that's the domestic force they're
[03:04:37.740 --> 03:04:41.420]  going to try to use to go after the public. But again, the biggest angle to all of this,
[03:04:41.420 --> 03:04:47.780]  Eric, is this. I'll cover when I get back briefly, then go to Kathy. The absolute key
[03:04:47.780 --> 03:04:54.220]  straight ahead. Let me tell you a day of bass fishing and firing 50 Cal and 308. I just
[03:04:54.220 --> 03:04:59.140]  absolutely feel like I had a five month five month vacation.

[03:08:01.900 --> 03:08:10.900]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. It's amazing that
[03:08:10.900 --> 03:08:17.620]  you've got 38 million people in California and you've got the police running scared.
[03:08:17.620 --> 03:08:23.300]  They've now shot up a second vehicle. First it was a blue Dodge truck. The suspect's truck
[03:08:23.300 --> 03:08:27.840]  was silver. Two women in it throwing papers out the back. You don't know what a paper
[03:08:27.840 --> 03:08:32.900]  route is. Boy, I thought five-year-olds know that. And I'm not supposed to criticize that.
[03:08:32.900 --> 03:08:37.300]  Well, see, the police are not above being criticized because if they are, they will
[03:08:37.300 --> 03:08:43.340]  turn into tyrants. And the New York police and others, LA police, when they do stuff
[03:08:43.340 --> 03:08:47.580]  like this, they need to be criticized. And by the way, the police chief of LA is calling
[03:08:47.580 --> 03:08:51.660]  for us to have all our semi-autos taken and they're introducing legislation to do it.
[03:08:51.660 --> 03:08:56.580]  So when cops come for your guns, folks, you better start criticizing them. A lot of folks
[03:08:56.580 --> 03:09:00.620]  are like, look, I'll turn my guns in. If the cops say turn them in, I am. Worshipping the
[03:09:00.620 --> 03:09:05.020]  government is not what an American's supposed to do. I know that I'm not supposed to have
[03:09:05.020 --> 03:09:09.220]  an opinion as an American. That's called a conspiracy theory. Anything other than what
[03:09:09.220 --> 03:09:11.140]  the government says is a conspiracy theory.
[03:09:11.140 --> 03:09:15.060]  Now if you don't like the TSA grabbing your genitals, they call you a conspiracy theorist.
[03:09:15.060 --> 03:09:19.460]  It's happened to me. It's happened to others. It'd be like, you know, I don't like pineapple
[03:09:19.460 --> 03:09:23.860]  on my pizza. Why are you a conspiracy theorist? Well, no, I just don't want pineapple. Oh
[03:09:23.860 --> 03:09:29.940]  my gosh, he thinks he doesn't like pineapple. Having a view is now a conspiracy theory.
[03:09:29.940 --> 03:09:35.980]  You understand? Now they are just going crazy in fear when statistically, I guarantee you
[03:09:35.980 --> 03:09:39.900]  cops are dying every couple of days because I know the Texas statistics, California, Texas
[03:09:39.900 --> 03:09:42.620]  is like 38 million, almost 30 million.
[03:09:42.620 --> 03:09:47.660]  California is 38 million. We count the illegal aliens, 50 million. I mean, come on. I mean
[03:09:47.660 --> 03:09:51.020]  right there, you're going to have cops dying all the time in car wrecks. Are they not on
[03:09:51.020 --> 03:09:56.540]  the road in fear? Yes, you randomly may get shot by this guy. So they're not doing motorcycle
[03:09:56.540 --> 03:09:58.780]  foot patrols.
[03:09:58.780 --> 03:10:03.400]  What's next, get out of your uniforms? That's next folks. There are already not many areas
[03:10:03.400 --> 03:10:08.680]  are taking the decals off the vehicles. It's called secret police. It always follows this
[03:10:08.680 --> 03:10:14.580]  and you've got this anti terror guy who wants to be the soldier. The alleged shooter fits
[03:10:14.580 --> 03:10:20.820]  the perfect MO and then he sees what he believes is racism, which I'm sure it's going on.
[03:10:20.820 --> 03:10:25.300]  It's tribalism. They've got departments that are mainly black and other people get discriminated
[03:10:25.300 --> 03:10:29.460]  against. Departments that are mainly white, it happens. Humans, it's not racism. It's
[03:10:29.460 --> 03:10:35.980]  tribal pack mentality. It's clicks. You can have one white country club and you can have
[03:10:35.980 --> 03:10:38.940]  another white country club and they don't like each other.
[03:10:38.940 --> 03:10:45.660]  Okay, I mean, that's just what people do. They get in clicks. Families have clicks where
[03:10:45.660 --> 03:10:51.060]  two siblings gang up on the other one with the parents. I mean, we all know about this.
[03:10:51.060 --> 03:10:54.060]  It's like the Star Trek episode where one group has black on one side and white on the
[03:10:54.060 --> 03:10:58.460]  other and the other leading group, the elite group, it's flipped. Genetics are the same
[03:10:58.460 --> 03:11:03.740]  except for that, but one group oppresses the other. They will use anything. In Africa,
[03:11:03.740 --> 03:11:06.580]  you'll have one tribe on the other side of the river and the other side, they follow
[03:11:06.580 --> 03:11:09.000]  the same religion, they still kill each other.
[03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:13.420]  Same thing here. Different Scottish tribes constantly killing each other. They all look
[03:11:13.420 --> 03:11:19.540]  the same, act the same, same culture. Does it matter? Constantly killing each other,
[03:11:19.540 --> 03:11:24.980]  okay? And all the photos and video of the cops with their guns. Hey, cops, what if this
[03:11:24.980 --> 03:11:26.980]  guy was targeting general citizens?
[03:11:26.980 --> 03:11:32.200]  Can we walk around with guns? No, you're not properly trained. See, that's where this is
[03:11:32.200 --> 03:11:39.000]  all going. And I said I'd go to your phone calls. Here's the big enchilada. Perhaps we
[03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:43.940]  should have all 38 million Californians who aren't government officials. Cuz in California,
[03:11:43.940 --> 03:11:48.140]  the government officials, not servants, are exempt from the red light cameras, exempt
[03:11:48.140 --> 03:11:49.540]  from warrants for speeding.
[03:11:49.540 --> 03:11:55.700]  You didn't know that over a million bureaucrats are exempt. So everyone but state or federal
[03:11:55.700 --> 03:12:00.900]  employees should show up at the end of your street with your children and the police will
[03:12:00.900 --> 03:12:05.340]  drop by at, you'll be told by cell phone. That's why they don't have government alerts
[03:12:05.340 --> 03:12:09.340]  on the cell phones. So you can get your orders to when to show up and you show up politely.
[03:12:09.340 --> 03:12:12.700]  And you think I'm being funny, Nazi Germany did this. People would show up, be rounded
[03:12:12.700 --> 03:12:15.240]  up, put in a pit, and they'd shoot people.
[03:12:15.240 --> 03:12:18.860]  And then folks would politely with their hat in hand, run down into the pit, buy other
[03:12:18.860 --> 03:12:23.460]  dead bodies, you've seen the film footage, to be killed. Now a conspiracy theorist would
[03:12:23.460 --> 03:12:28.020]  resist cuz they'd think I'm about to be killed. I might as well try to go out for one of these
[03:12:28.020 --> 03:12:32.220]  guys or I heard they're killing folks over in the next town. We have no hope but to fight
[03:12:32.220 --> 03:12:37.300]  back. But see, I'm a bad man. I'm a very bad man. You understand, I'm a lot of people that
[03:12:37.300 --> 03:12:41.220]  founded this country in my mind and in my mindset.
[03:12:41.220 --> 03:12:45.860]  But that's evil. I mean, you go to infowars.com, we have a graphic of Thomas Jefferson up there
[03:12:45.860 --> 03:12:50.740]  that says no free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms. Cuz only a free man has arms,
[03:12:50.740 --> 03:12:56.300]  by the way, that's kind of a trick question. We're gonna send that out on Facebook right
[03:12:56.300 --> 03:13:01.220]  now. I'm also gonna Twitter that, tell the guys to tweet that out for me, thank you.
[03:13:01.220 --> 03:13:04.900]  So this is what we're dealing with. I guess Christie doing a great job is listening right
[03:13:04.900 --> 03:13:09.140]  now so she can do that. Go to real Alex Jones on Twitter if you want that. This is what
[03:13:09.140 --> 03:13:13.580]  frustrates me. They've got drones, secret arrests, torture bases, the government runs
[03:13:13.580 --> 03:13:14.580]  al-Qaeda.
[03:13:14.580 --> 03:13:18.600]  The Brookings Institute has come out and said yes, the government is running al-Qaeda in
[03:13:18.600 --> 03:13:26.100]  Africa and other countries to take over. They're the pretext to take over. But that's not scary.
[03:13:26.100 --> 03:13:31.580]  I mean, the news said Hillary is the most popular person in America. They had a poll.
[03:13:31.580 --> 03:13:36.020]  And again, I could go to a Klan rally and poll their favorite person, they'd say Adolf
[03:13:36.020 --> 03:13:43.020]  Hitler. It's who they poll. I mean, this propaganda is so cartoon level. But see, I always thought
[03:13:43.020 --> 03:13:45.380]  it was cartoon level and that it was bad propaganda.
[03:13:45.380 --> 03:13:51.780]  No, no, no, it's good. By putting really bad dumbed down stuff out, people just get lost
[03:13:51.780 --> 03:13:56.820]  in it cuz they can't compute. It's like a slow Loris attack, isn't a denial of service
[03:13:56.820 --> 03:14:04.380]  really. It goes in with certain functions that doesn't really overload the general processors
[03:14:04.380 --> 03:14:05.380]  at first.
[03:14:05.380 --> 03:14:10.960]  But the way I've had it described is that it starts a process of a request and then
[03:14:10.960 --> 03:14:15.180]  never lets the process follow out, just keeps asking for it. And then it shuts down your
[03:14:15.180 --> 03:14:18.880]  website. And that's kind of what it is. It's like, yeah, we got drones, we're gonna kill
[03:14:18.880 --> 03:14:22.420]  you and secretly arrest you. But he has a peace prize, so it's okay. And yeah, the government
[03:14:22.420 --> 03:14:26.500]  runs Al-Qaeda and yeah, we're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines, but yeah, but it's
[03:14:26.500 --> 03:14:27.500]  good for it.
[03:14:27.500 --> 03:14:31.500]  You may have a seizure and die, but just don't worry about it. The extremists don't lie again.
[03:14:31.500 --> 03:14:37.420]  And yeah, lead is now good for you, and so is melamine. And yeah, and it's just meant
[03:14:37.420 --> 03:14:43.540]  to be like, what? What? We're not in a tyranny, but you better not tell the police or I'll
[03:14:43.540 --> 03:14:47.860]  arrest you. And it's just meant to just overwhelm you where you just give up.
[03:14:47.860 --> 03:14:52.540]  Stop even caring what they're saying, other than to analyze it, to laugh at it, to spit
[03:14:52.540 --> 03:14:57.660]  on the ground. I mean, it's time to spit on the ground in front of government, unless
[03:14:57.660 --> 03:15:02.020]  the government person says, I'm a servant, I apologize, you're right. I'm doing everything
[03:15:02.020 --> 03:15:03.240]  I can to fix this.
[03:15:03.240 --> 03:15:07.140]  It's time to say I don't respect you, cuz you work for a system. You're under the system.
[03:15:07.140 --> 03:15:10.780]  You came riding out of Mordor. They're like, well, I'm not a bad person. Really, you're
[03:15:10.780 --> 03:15:16.900]  in the uniform of Mordor. All right, I'm ranting and I said I'd go to your calls. Kathy, interesting
[03:15:16.900 --> 03:15:22.780]  vet suicide story. I'd say terrifying, saddening. What is the story there? I see you have on
[03:15:22.780 --> 03:15:23.780]  the screen.
[03:15:23.780 --> 03:15:31.340]  Alex, am I on? Yes, ma'am. Okay, Alex, I've watched you and listened to you since day
[03:15:31.340 --> 03:15:36.540]  one on Austin Access. And I enjoyed your preaching on Wednesday, so keep it up.
[03:15:36.540 --> 03:15:39.660]  Hey, is this Kathy, one of the church ladies I've met before?
[03:15:39.660 --> 03:15:40.660]  Yes.
[03:15:40.660 --> 03:15:47.620]  Oh, yeah, okay, how you doing? But it's been a long time since I've seen you. I'm usually
[03:15:47.620 --> 03:15:48.620]  with my aunt.
[03:15:48.620 --> 03:15:49.940]  Yes, how's she doing?
[03:15:49.940 --> 03:15:55.300]  Yes, she's doing great. And she sends you her love and her prayers.
[03:15:55.300 --> 03:16:00.260]  You know why I like you ladies? It's not that you're older. I mean, you're a lot younger,
[03:16:00.260 --> 03:16:05.420]  but I've known you for about 16 years or so. So 17 years, so we've all gotten older, is
[03:16:05.420 --> 03:16:10.700]  that you guys have that same glow in your eyes that my grandmother has. Good Christian
[03:16:10.700 --> 03:16:11.700]  ladies.
[03:16:11.700 --> 03:16:15.140]  Oh, my goodness. Well, thank you. I was just so excited when you were preaching the other
[03:16:15.140 --> 03:16:20.300]  day. I was just jumping up and down and had to let my aunt know she's 91 and a half now
[03:16:20.300 --> 03:16:21.300]  today.
[03:16:21.300 --> 03:16:22.300]  Wow.
[03:16:22.300 --> 03:16:27.140]  So anyway, but I wanted to share with you that I was at the grocery store a few days
[03:16:27.140 --> 03:16:31.580]  after Christmas and I was visiting with a lady at the grocery store and she told me
[03:16:31.580 --> 03:16:39.300]  her son had died around the first of December and he had killed himself and he was a veteran.
[03:16:39.300 --> 03:16:44.420]  And I was asking her and I was sharing with her a few things that you had said. And she
[03:16:44.420 --> 03:16:51.620]  said that within their circle of family and friends, that within that circle, they had
[03:16:51.620 --> 03:16:58.300]  found out that two other guys had also committed, had committed suicide on the same day and
[03:16:58.300 --> 03:17:03.580]  they didn't even know each other. And she said all three had set up the same ritual
[03:17:03.580 --> 03:17:10.540]  of this like a white towel over their head and had these room deodorizers in a circle
[03:17:10.540 --> 03:17:11.540]  around them.
[03:17:11.540 --> 03:17:17.060]  All right, well, you need to come to the office then on Monday. We need to do an investigation
[03:17:17.060 --> 03:17:23.660]  because I've known you, I don't know, like 16 years at least since about 1996 or so.
[03:17:23.660 --> 03:17:28.300]  And know you and you, well, we've been, I think, been out to dinner once or twice, but
[03:17:28.300 --> 03:17:36.820]  the point is, is that if, and you run a really conservative, nice, a believable circle and
[03:17:36.820 --> 03:17:39.020]  you're saying they're doing bizarre rituals.
[03:17:39.020 --> 03:17:44.060]  This sounds like mind control to me. Describe slowly what they're doing.
[03:17:44.060 --> 03:17:48.180]  I don't even know the lady. I mean, this was just a conversation that we struck up and
[03:17:48.180 --> 03:17:52.380]  then of course I was interested and so I started asking her questions and all. And so this
[03:17:52.380 --> 03:18:00.740]  is basically what she told me. She just said that they had, each one of them had this towel
[03:18:00.740 --> 03:18:05.220]  and she was kind of, you know, like maybe a, I don't know what size, but anyway, it
[03:18:05.220 --> 03:18:08.540]  was, I think she said it was a white towel. She said two of them had put it over their
[03:18:08.540 --> 03:18:14.020]  head. The other one had, her son had laid it out in front of him and she just made some
[03:18:14.020 --> 03:18:20.180]  and she said, and what was so strange is all three of them were found with these room deodorizers
[03:18:20.180 --> 03:18:25.340]  put in a circle in the room around them and they had shot themselves in the mouth with
[03:18:25.340 --> 03:18:26.340]  their guns.
[03:18:26.340 --> 03:18:31.580]  And she said, you know, it's just, she said, we've just been wondering if the military
[03:18:31.580 --> 03:18:36.780]  wasn't teaching them how to kill themselves. Well, you know, with the room deodorizers
[03:18:36.780 --> 03:18:40.780]  I've studied mind control. It won't just be the catcher and the rye as a verbal trigger.
[03:18:40.780 --> 03:18:44.300]  They'll a lot of times do the programming and only takes a few weeks now with the drugs
[03:18:44.300 --> 03:18:48.020]  and stuff they've got. They should be checking their brains for chips and things too. That's
[03:18:48.020 --> 03:18:51.860]  old technology, but they don't like that because it can be found.
[03:18:51.860 --> 03:18:55.580]  And a lot of times they'll do have smells associated with the programming and then they'll
[03:18:55.580 --> 03:19:00.140]  have simulators while they're on hallucinogenic drugs and other things where they simulate
[03:19:00.140 --> 03:19:05.420]  killing themselves. And then the electrodes they've got running into their brain, torturing
[03:19:05.420 --> 03:19:09.900]  them. They've got other systems it's turned off when they kill themselves.
[03:19:09.900 --> 03:19:14.300]  But then they, they're not in the horrible pain until the trigger word is given and they
[03:19:14.300 --> 03:19:17.740]  call them up on the telephone. People see this in movies because folks that's based
[03:19:17.740 --> 03:19:22.920]  on real stuff and they give them generally a bunch of code words to make sure it's not
[03:19:22.920 --> 03:19:24.400]  something they accidentally hear.
[03:19:24.400 --> 03:19:31.300]  But like, you know, dolphin, tower, red shield. I mean, I'm not giving actual programs out.
[03:19:31.300 --> 03:19:37.340]  I'm just randomly giving things out that are similar to what they would do. And then the
[03:19:37.340 --> 03:19:41.380]  person goes into a trance and then goes and does it. And they've been given the troops
[03:19:41.380 --> 03:19:43.720]  so many drugs, so many experiments.
[03:19:43.720 --> 03:19:47.380]  Troops I've talked to say we don't remember anything for like weeks and time went by.
[03:19:47.380 --> 03:19:52.940]  Yeah, no. I mean, they want robots, but robots aren't as good as humans yet. So they're practicing
[03:19:52.940 --> 03:19:57.000]  with mind control. That's what the Marine Corps, the army, the no sleep, the shaving
[03:19:57.000 --> 03:20:01.340]  the heads. That's old German mind control, 200 years old.

[03:20:30.060 --> 03:20:35.060]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors
[03:20:35.060 --> 03:20:40.140]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't
[03:20:40.140 --> 03:20:44.820]  recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet
[03:20:44.820 --> 03:20:51.300]  no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[03:21:04.900 --> 03:21:11.220]  Box. I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan
[03:21:11.220 --> 03:21:15.380]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the
[03:21:15.380 --> 03:21:20.940]  President could obtain its world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are
[03:21:20.940 --> 03:21:25.460]  used around the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved

[03:22:00.260 --> 03:22:05.140]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnebel from Midas Resources. As you know, federal government
[03:22:05.140 --> 03:22:09.660]  spending is at an all-time high and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[03:22:09.660 --> 03:22:13.740]  European government and central bank spending policies have put the European Union on the
[03:22:13.740 --> 03:22:17.500]  brink of collapse. What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially? Are your
[03:22:17.500 --> 03:22:22.020]  assets working for you or against you? One thing is certain, having physical possession
[03:22:22.020 --> 03:22:25.460]  of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens to our economy or the
[03:22:25.460 --> 03:22:29.920]  dollar, your investment will never be worthless. It will protect you from that hidden tax,
[03:22:29.920 --> 03:22:34.560]  inflation. If you've been thinking about investing in physical possession of precious metals
[03:22:34.560 --> 03:22:40.540]  or having an IRA in precious metals, I can help. Call me today, Peter Kronschnebel, at

[03:24:22.580 --> 03:24:31.260]  blue, the red, white and blue. And when the band plays, head out to the tree floor, they
[03:24:31.260 --> 03:24:39.780]  point their cannon at you. Oh yeah, they point their cannon at you. It ain't me. It ain't
[03:24:39.780 --> 03:24:50.740]  no senator's son. All right, I'm babbling and torturing people. Kathy, I'm gonna give
[03:24:50.740 --> 03:24:53.620]  you my phone number. I think I gave it to you years ago, but I'd like you to give it
[03:24:53.620 --> 03:24:57.060]  to that lady or come by the office sometime next week. We're all real busy, obviously.
[03:24:57.060 --> 03:25:02.660]  You are too, I'm sure, but I'd like to talk to that lady because they're killing themselves
[03:25:02.660 --> 03:25:09.940]  at rates, last time I saw, seven times any previous record. 22 a day, and it's like they're
[03:25:09.940 --> 03:25:14.660]  being programmed with a disposal switch. And notice there's not checkpoints and freaking
[03:25:14.660 --> 03:25:17.060]  out and cops running around with machine guns.
[03:25:17.060 --> 03:25:20.980]  22 vets are killing themselves a day. My gosh, into the world, three cops were killed in
[03:25:20.980 --> 03:25:25.140]  Southern California. Into the world, into the world. No, they just wanna keep it quiet
[03:25:25.140 --> 03:25:29.460]  and just salute the troops and thank them for what they've done. But be hollow and don't
[03:25:29.460 --> 03:25:32.740]  actually try to get them out of the evil wars. Don't try to find out why they're killing
[03:25:32.740 --> 03:25:37.460]  themselves. What do you think's behind all this? I mean, I know they're testing all sorts
[03:25:37.460 --> 03:25:38.460]  of drugs on them.
[03:25:38.460 --> 03:25:42.660]  Yeah, well, I don't know. I've just always wondered about the mind control.
[03:25:42.660 --> 03:25:47.260]  Well, that is mind control. Taking Prozac will make you go crazy sometimes and kill
[03:25:47.260 --> 03:25:51.060]  people, but it's not gonna make everybody do the same ritual like an army in or something.
[03:25:51.060 --> 03:25:56.340]  Well, I mean, I was wondering about the trigger effect, kind of like something like you were
[03:25:56.340 --> 03:25:57.340]  talking about.
[03:25:57.340 --> 03:26:01.020]  I mean, they're directly out of programming. See, they need some compulsive ritual they
[03:26:01.020 --> 03:26:07.980]  do in some of the classic programming. See, I need to talk to her. Were they in special
[03:26:07.980 --> 03:26:11.980]  operations and things? Look, they're killing a bunch of, Navy SEALs are getting murdered
[03:26:11.980 --> 03:26:12.980]  every week or something.
[03:26:12.980 --> 03:26:18.540]  I mean, folks, there's definitely a bunch of stuff going on. You see, after you've gone
[03:26:18.540 --> 03:26:22.660]  and done all this stuff for them, they're gonna kill you, especially if you were in
[03:26:22.660 --> 03:26:27.860]  a truly, really dark type stuff. Well, listen, Kathy, I'm gonna give you my number and I'll
[03:26:27.860 --> 03:26:30.980]  try to call you later today or you can try to call me or just give me your number and
[03:26:30.980 --> 03:26:31.980]  God bless you.
[03:26:31.980 --> 03:26:35.460]  I'll put you back on hold. Anything else that she told you we should know?
[03:26:35.460 --> 03:26:43.340]  No, she just said her husband was going to try to investigate it. But if I see her again
[03:26:43.340 --> 03:26:46.060]  at the store, I'll be sure to try to make her-
[03:26:46.060 --> 03:26:48.220]  And she came off as credible to you?
[03:26:48.220 --> 03:26:50.180]  Yeah, yeah, very much so.
[03:26:50.180 --> 03:26:55.180]  Well, you know what? We need to have a time maybe on the Sunday show, four to six or something,
[03:26:55.180 --> 03:27:00.900]  to open the phones up for families to talk about veterans. I'm doing it Sunday, one hour
[03:27:00.900 --> 03:27:05.900]  on people to call in whose family members have committed suicide. They're gonna hate
[03:27:05.900 --> 03:27:09.620]  this cuz they want you just to forget about the veterans and just salute them at the football
[03:27:09.620 --> 03:27:10.940]  game.
[03:27:10.940 --> 03:27:13.660]  And then meanwhile, just keep quiet about why they're all killing themselves. We're
[03:27:13.660 --> 03:27:19.460]  gonna do that Sunday. Guys, make me Sunday, spend an hour for people's reports of suicide
[03:27:19.460 --> 03:27:28.580]  to humanize these people. Let's go to Smedley in Montana. Smedley, go ahead, sir.
[03:27:28.580 --> 03:27:33.820]  Howdy, howdy. He's from FEMA Region 8, formerly known as Big Sky Country. Just a couple of
[03:27:33.820 --> 03:27:38.980]  quick comments, Alex, on Infowars related, and I'll get to my main one real quick. The
[03:27:38.980 --> 03:27:45.300]  other day you did a segment on flipping the script. Very, very powerful. I played it to
[03:27:45.300 --> 03:27:50.340]  a couple of my friends that normally will not listen to anything. I think I woke a couple
[03:27:50.340 --> 03:27:51.340]  of them up.
[03:27:51.340 --> 03:27:55.420]  Well, I mean, look, I mean, it's happening now. They're flipping from Al-Qaeda is what
[03:27:55.420 --> 03:28:00.180]  we're taking your rights to. It's you, you're the terrorists. The Army's for you, for you.
[03:28:00.180 --> 03:28:02.260]  I mean, it's all happening.
[03:28:02.260 --> 03:28:08.180]  Yeah, and I mean, it's just watching that. You were on fire that day, buddy, you were
[03:28:08.180 --> 03:28:13.740]  on fire. And so if you're too busy to expound on that, that may be my entry in the Paul
[03:28:13.740 --> 03:28:19.740]  Revere contract contest. I'll try to do something on that. The other thing I wanted to say is
[03:28:19.740 --> 03:28:25.420]  this year's staff, Paul, Aaron, Rob, Darren, David, David, Melissa, Dakari, Mike, Adam,
[03:28:25.420 --> 03:28:29.580]  these people are just incredible. And I used to be a Dallas Cowboy, knew who was on the
[03:28:29.580 --> 03:28:35.100]  waiver wire. I mean, Dallas Cowboy fan, I should say. And now I don't even pay attention.
[03:28:35.100 --> 03:28:39.700]  I pay attention to this superstar. These guys are my superstars. The other thing I wanted
[03:28:39.700 --> 03:28:46.020]  to say was, there was a congressman, you know, you talk a lot of times about the power of
[03:28:46.020 --> 03:28:51.580]  talk radio. Well, there was this congressman on talk radio the other day, and usually people
[03:28:51.580 --> 03:28:57.220]  call in and it's stuff nondescript, like bus schedules and all this kind of stuff, right?
[03:28:57.220 --> 03:29:02.940]  Well, he was on the other day, and man, I'm telling you, he was sweating. I could feel
[03:29:02.940 --> 03:29:07.920]  it. Talk about your feet being held to the fire. The calls just one after the other was
[03:29:07.920 --> 03:29:13.180]  Agenda 21. By the way, I guess Rosa Corey's coming up this way in a couple of months.
[03:29:13.180 --> 03:29:18.220]  He was being hit with questions about preserving the Second Amendment drone, fluoride in the
[03:29:18.220 --> 03:29:23.100]  water. And here in Montana, you can call back and get on again. So there were people calling
[03:29:23.100 --> 03:29:26.380]  back and getting on two or three times. It's just hammering on this guy.
[03:29:26.380 --> 03:29:30.920]  No, it's awesome. But remember, I think it's good the police have shot up two people's
[03:29:30.920 --> 03:29:34.820]  vehicles who were innocent. They didn't even look like the suspect's vehicle. I think all
[03:29:34.820 --> 03:29:38.460]  Californians should arrange themselves at the end of the block for the police to drive
[03:29:38.460 --> 03:29:42.180]  by and shoot them and their families for their safety. I mean, that's reasonable, isn't it?
[03:29:42.180 --> 03:29:46.420]  No, no, seriously, I hope they catch this guy. It's really terrible what's happening.
[03:29:46.420 --> 03:30:06.100]  But he is a big Obama and Piers Morgan supporter. God bless you.
