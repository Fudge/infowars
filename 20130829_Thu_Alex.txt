[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:35.840]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well I barely made
[00:35.840 --> 00:44.560]  it to work today not once but twice police are so recklessly driving on the highways
[00:45.920 --> 00:50.640]  that the nanny that we have that comes three days a week is my wife home schools the children
[00:50.640 --> 00:57.840]  who needs help sometimes the police just pulled out in front of cars when people see police they
[00:57.840 --> 01:03.360]  just began slamming on their brakes so someone ran in the back of her we had to deal with that
[01:03.360 --> 01:16.400]  and she was crying when she called us and I had to drive out there onto 71 by 290 and then on my
[01:16.400 --> 01:26.560]  way to work on 290 a motorcycle cop under the first street bridge in Austin is radar gunning
[01:26.560 --> 01:33.120]  people 70 mile an hour speed limit and I and I looked down I was going 70 had on cruise control
[01:33.680 --> 01:38.960]  but I wonder why he pulled out right behind me got right up on my tail and then shot around me at
[01:38.960 --> 01:44.720]  about a hundred miles an hour 90 miles an hour down behind this woman so fast you could know
[01:44.720 --> 01:51.680]  what was going on he's pointing pull over to the left to the median that's where they like to pull
[01:51.680 --> 01:59.040]  you over on 290 and she doesn't immediately do it so he gyrates and guns it over and cars swerve
[01:59.040 --> 02:04.720]  and almost hit each other and almost slam into me as everyone's slamming their brakes on so he
[02:04.720 --> 02:09.920]  can tell her get over and obviously I didn't I couldn't grab myself on a shoot video all this
[02:09.920 --> 02:12.720]  is happening I'm going to put a dash cam in my car but still that would have been dangerous to
[02:12.720 --> 02:17.600]  even reach up and at that I mean just reckless driving police just everywhere I mean it's like
[02:17.600 --> 02:26.000]  road warrior it is like absolute road warrior I mean I I mean literally just and I see this all
[02:26.000 --> 02:34.480]  the time but not twice in a row not twice in a row and man I was like man that cop's like
[02:34.480 --> 02:38.640]  right up on my tail and right on me I'm like why is he sitting there and then near him over and then
[02:38.640 --> 02:44.000]  zooming up and then I get over and then she didn't get over so he gets over that needs the
[02:44.000 --> 02:52.720]  the tapes on that didn't need to be pulled that was it 10 10 roughly this morning on 290 under
[02:52.720 --> 02:56.640]  the first street bridge is where that started and of course the cops will if they even reviewed will
[02:56.640 --> 03:03.760]  go good job Bob you scared the hell out of them slaves how many cops do I know and do I see in
[03:03.760 --> 03:09.120]  the news though that lose their kids to cop caused accidents hey cops your kids are all going to get
[03:09.120 --> 03:13.760]  killed by cops that's how God works we'll just take the protection away your kids are going to end
[03:13.760 --> 03:18.000]  up getting paralyzed or dead and I'm sad about that go ahead and drive as reckless as you want and
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.080]  laugh about it it's like in Miami when this woman has a sign about the first amendment
[03:22.080 --> 03:27.680]  at a protest and they shoot a rubber bullet knocking her eyeball pop partially out and then
[03:27.680 --> 03:32.640]  it shows them at the briefing after the police chief going or the deputy chief going good job
[03:32.640 --> 03:40.560]  shooting that woman in the face with a sign the new world order is going to drag you to hell
[03:40.560 --> 03:48.240]  so go ahead and enjoy it all you want and I again I'm not anti police I'm anti North Korean police
[03:48.240 --> 03:54.000]  Mexican police corrupt police and there is a twisting of the police going on in this country
[03:54.000 --> 04:00.480]  massively and I mean it's dangerous coming to work in the morning with the police it is and it's
[04:00.480 --> 04:08.240]  dangerous to them too and I'm just tired of dodging the police all day but you had a victory had a
[04:08.240 --> 04:15.760]  big wreck big pile up on was 290 and then again on 290 I'm saying 71 that's right by it okay I'm
[04:15.760 --> 04:21.280]  done talking about that uh until later when I bring up the story again to tie it into basically

[08:33.680 --> 08:42.880]  days away from a nato open bombardment of the sovereign nation of syria that has had nato
[08:42.880 --> 08:50.560]  along with turkey who's also a member and then jordan who's affiliated israel who's affiliated
[08:50.560 --> 08:57.520]  but not part of nato as well as jihadis out of iraq um they have been facing a two and a half
[08:57.520 --> 09:05.760]  year insertion of hundreds of thousands of al-qaeda and assorted jihadi forces engaging in unimaginable
[09:05.760 --> 09:13.840]  war crimes killing more than 200 000 people most of them civilians by the rebels who are called
[09:13.840 --> 09:21.120]  activist and protesters by seeing in fox news msnbc and others it is unbelievable it is a war on
[09:21.120 --> 09:27.680]  reality now the good news is even the new york times has had to admit that okay uh there's really
[09:27.680 --> 09:33.040]  no proof as i did this and the israeli proof that they've put out is actually the top general
[09:33.040 --> 09:38.640]  yelling at his troops saying you better not be the ones that are behind this so that's their
[09:38.640 --> 09:46.480]  proof uh why would the Assad regime uh that's been gaining ground against the al-qaeda forces in the
[09:46.480 --> 09:52.160]  west and the and the whole globalist anglo-american world ganging up on them with the jihadis why would
[09:52.160 --> 09:56.560]  they do the one thing that allows the open air bombardment by cruise missiles fighter bombers
[09:56.560 --> 10:03.520]  bombers you name it and we've already talked all about that but the big issue here is uh the most
[10:03.520 --> 10:11.440]  widely circulated newspaper in israel is reporting us attack on syria to begin saturday and we have
[10:11.440 --> 10:18.960]  that up on info wars dot com and the writer that wrote the articles also tweeted this is a big
[10:18.960 --> 10:26.640]  lakud uh style paper very closely associated with benzeman yet and yahoo and the those in power in
[10:26.640 --> 10:33.040]  the kinesic so this well i mean we hope this isn't just saber rattling uh this is uh very very scary
[10:33.040 --> 10:38.720]  for anybody that understands geopolitically what this means but us attack on syria to begin saturday
[10:38.720 --> 10:46.000]  onslaught to begin with un inspectors leave and that is in the london guardian as well syrian
[10:46.000 --> 10:52.080]  crisis un inspectors to leave on saturday uh live updates uh seeing in reports obama us
[10:52.080 --> 10:58.480]  concludes syria carried out chemical weapons attack uh that came out last night and then they
[10:58.480 --> 11:07.520]  don't give any proof very bizarre and you saw of course carry three days ago now the secretary
[11:07.520 --> 11:11.360]  of state saying we know they did it we have conclusive proof and then six months later going
[11:11.360 --> 11:16.320]  we know there was chemical weapons that were released that's the that's the proof we don't know
[11:16.320 --> 11:23.760]  who did it so just incredible to see this going on because they don't have 72 percent support
[11:23.760 --> 11:29.680]  like they did in gallup poll and 75 percent in pew and others like they had back in march
[11:29.680 --> 11:36.160]  was it march 15th uh of 2003 when the second iraq war launched and you know that war was
[11:36.160 --> 11:39.920]  based on fraud and lies and was for defense contractors to make money and to destabilize
[11:39.920 --> 11:44.160]  the middle east and begin this you know that core takeover be able to invade and destabilize the whole
[11:44.160 --> 11:49.040]  area as they're now doing that's part of the official pinac plan the pentagon plan and leslie
[11:49.040 --> 11:56.480]  clark's talked about that and it's it's on record bush did go get congressional authorization and he
[11:56.480 --> 12:00.800]  did get you an authorization which i said at the time he didn't need though you don't want to start
[12:00.800 --> 12:05.520]  world war three with the russia so i guess he did need it the point is is that the real authorization
[12:05.520 --> 12:11.600]  under law has to come from our congress they control the purse they control the war making
[12:11.600 --> 12:17.360]  the president is given a declaration of war now they call it an authorization even that's
[12:17.360 --> 12:21.200]  unconstitutional but see now they've gotten away from that to just i'll do whatever i want and
[12:21.200 --> 12:28.160]  nato's you know the reason i can do this and that authorization that declaration says who the war
[12:28.160 --> 12:33.840]  who the enemy is what the goals are so the congress is the representative of the people
[12:33.840 --> 12:39.600]  collectively giving the order to the commander-in-chief and the president doesn't become the commander-in-chief
[12:41.600 --> 12:47.360]  until there's a declaration of war okay they're not a commander-in-chief until there's a
[12:47.360 --> 12:52.880]  declaration and we say this is the enemy here's our goals here's what to be done launch it do as
[12:52.880 --> 12:58.880]  fast as possible not oh we're under nato in the un we just we're going to bomb this country and put
[12:58.880 --> 13:05.440]  al-qaeda in that country and then fight al-qaeda in this country and this is all about america
[13:05.440 --> 13:12.080]  being the muscle for a global empire and everybody knows that but we're paying for it and not even
[13:12.080 --> 13:17.680]  getting the spoils of it so even if you're immoral you should not want this because you're paying for
[13:17.680 --> 13:23.520]  it and it's destabilizing the planet it's extremely dangerous and this very military
[13:23.520 --> 13:29.440]  industrial complex that eisenhower said beware the military industrial complex we must guard
[13:29.440 --> 13:35.200]  against them in the councils of government there is a technological scientific elite in control
[13:35.200 --> 13:41.120]  and they are already taking over this development poses the greatest threat to our nation i mean
[13:41.120 --> 13:45.440]  you ought to go watch the 21 minute speech she always just here beware the military industrial
[13:45.440 --> 13:50.560]  complex he said the technocrats that run it because they came to eisenhower kurtis lemay
[13:50.560 --> 13:57.440]  and ll lemnitzer this has all come out on front line bbsd classified and they said we want to have
[13:57.440 --> 14:04.080]  a nuclear war with uh with russia it's going to happen we need to launch it first we'll only lose
[14:04.080 --> 14:09.120]  10 to 15 million but if we let them ever strike us first we'll lose 50 60 million we'll lose more
[14:09.120 --> 14:16.000]  than a third of the population the u.s population was only like 200 million then and um he said
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.920]  but they respected him enough because he'd been the supreme commander a allied commander in the
[14:21.920 --> 14:27.520]  european theater that he was able to back them down kennedy came in and they're like look you're
[14:27.520 --> 14:32.240]  just a pt captain buddy we run this show and we're going to have a nuclear war with russia
[14:32.960 --> 14:38.160]  and kennedy fired them all so they had the cia blow his head off but still that kept him from
[14:38.160 --> 14:40.880]  being able to launch it because they were all kicked out of government they were all hired
[14:40.880 --> 14:45.680]  right back afterwards but still cooler heads prevailed and the russians knew the plan and like
[14:45.680 --> 14:51.120]  wow these people are really crazy we're not going to do this plus the russians then it's all come
[14:51.120 --> 14:57.920]  out in sultz and eatson's book real the second book realized that oh my gosh the bankers are playing
[14:57.920 --> 15:04.560]  us off against each other they put us in power the communist they put linen in power they they tried
[15:04.560 --> 15:09.200]  to keep Stalin in power but he basically got poisoned as well and so there was a counter coup
[15:09.200 --> 15:13.280]  against the globalist in the russians but they were corrupt and evil and oppressive as well but
[15:13.280 --> 15:19.680]  they they lost that red purge kill millions every year exterminate all the christians and there was
[15:19.680 --> 15:24.240]  like secret christian rebellions within the russians within what was left of the white russians
[15:24.240 --> 15:30.320]  inside and and and so the russians weren't as bad in the 60s 70s and 80s they were still terrible
[15:30.320 --> 15:35.600]  but but but like weren't red terror you know let's kill everybody because they figured that out
[15:37.120 --> 15:40.240]  and that's why the globalists have hated russia ever since our government
[15:40.240 --> 15:49.680]  is run by globalist and they ran the russians until the 50s okay until the late 50s most
[15:49.680 --> 15:56.000]  estimates mid 50s maybe the point is is this is the real world ladies and gentlemen and
[15:56.640 --> 16:02.400]  the russians pay people to have kids the russians say the west is run by eugenicist just as the
[16:02.400 --> 16:06.880]  communists were this is in their newspapers over there the russians all know about the the angle
[16:06.880 --> 16:14.640]  american new world order plans they were under it the czars the czar nicolas was was was was
[16:14.640 --> 16:20.320]  almost identical twin to the king of england guys show uh czar nicolas next to the king of england
[16:21.200 --> 16:26.960]  pull up like 1917 because they would visit each other and they were so perfectly inbred that you
[16:26.960 --> 16:32.240]  couldn't tell them apart but there's photos of them in the same uniforms and the british funded with
[16:32.240 --> 16:38.560]  the rothschilds took out their cousins there is no other royalty worldwide that doesn't give fieldy
[16:38.560 --> 16:42.800]  the british crown that's why they have events every decade at the tower where all the royalty
[16:42.800 --> 16:48.480]  including the emperor of japan come i saw this on c span once we ought to find this we dug some
[16:48.480 --> 16:54.240]  of this up in their archives last night looking for it colin pal saying i am under the queen's
[16:54.240 --> 17:00.320]  command and obama saying he basically has fieldy to her all this crazy stuff but and the bush is
[17:00.320 --> 17:06.560]  saying it and but the issue is we need to dig up the footage let me think it's probably like 1990
[17:07.680 --> 17:14.560]  92 of the royalty of the world at the power bowing to the queen of england and swearing
[17:14.560 --> 17:18.720]  fieldy to her because if you don't do that they will come and invade your country and they will
[17:18.720 --> 17:24.240]  kill you they will drop hydrogen bombs on you yeah there they are there is the king of england
[17:24.240 --> 17:31.440]  and czar nicolas the king of russia of the russian empire you could not tell the two men apart
[17:32.000 --> 17:37.200]  ladies and gentlemen so you know i mean we owe the russians an absolute apology
[17:38.560 --> 17:43.200]  for letting the bankers conquer us and then do that to them to put linen in
[17:44.320 --> 17:47.680]  hundreds of thousands of americans were shipped in mainly out of new york
[17:47.680 --> 17:55.040]  the bolsheviks took them years to take over they just started in 1917 and they'd murdered
[17:55.040 --> 17:59.120]  hundreds of thousands of military officers it was just after they took the guns guys type in
[18:01.440 --> 18:07.760]  bolshevik turn your guns in poster or communist and it shows that the posters they put out 1918
[18:07.760 --> 18:10.560]  when they taken over saying turn your guns in it's going to be all right then they came and
[18:10.560 --> 18:16.880]  killed everybody and and and you can pull this up showing the loving commas are the local police

[18:23.280 --> 18:28.720]  were raped really hard before before they were murdered weren't they because they're going to
[18:28.720 --> 18:37.920]  run a red terror here there it is that is their plan ladies and gentlemen 110 goldman sacks jp
[18:37.920 --> 18:42.480]  morgan you go back to goldman sacks and the societies that founded that on record funding
[18:42.480 --> 18:48.640]  the bolsheviks goldman sacks funded the bolshevik revolution ladies and gentlemen the groups that
[18:48.640 --> 18:58.720]  founded that all of this is pure crystalline evil okay and and it's time for everyone to
[18:58.720 --> 19:03.920]  understand how much danger we're in and the globalists need to start big wars to destabilize the

[19:11.360 --> 19:16.160]  exact same they use the outside threat to set up a police state and then when they capture the
[19:16.160 --> 19:20.080]  government they get the police state just like they use al-qaeda to set up the police state
[19:20.080 --> 19:24.880]  and then once a decade passes they flip it and say oh no the homeland security for gun owners

[24:21.280 --> 24:26.400]  they didn't take the muslim hatred of the united states' face and logo being on this tyranny
[24:26.960 --> 24:32.080]  to then energize even more jihadis which they then direct against their enemies because the public
[24:32.080 --> 24:41.680]  is not aware of this divide and conquer strategy now i just mentioned the member of the uk independence
[24:41.680 --> 24:47.920]  party their head and member of the EU parliament nigel forage on rt and he came out and basically
[24:47.920 --> 24:53.360]  said the uk government is the keenest of all on syria intervention has already made up their mind
[24:53.360 --> 25:00.240]  here is a clip from rt of that well now let's discuss the western powers eagerness to act on
[25:00.240 --> 25:04.880]  syria with nigel forage who's the leader of the uk independence party and a member of the european
[25:04.880 --> 25:10.080]  parliament mr forage thank you so much for joining us here on rt well as we know the uk parliament is
[25:10.080 --> 25:16.800]  being recalled to vote on a response a response to the alleged chemical attacks in syria but why
[25:16.800 --> 25:22.800]  now i mean why not wait until the un investigators finish their job and you know come up with some
[25:22.800 --> 25:28.720]  results of their fact-finding mission well from the very start it's been the british government
[25:28.720 --> 25:34.000]  particularly in the shape of william haig and indeed david cameron himself who throughout the
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.800]  entire international community have been the keenest to get involved in syria you know whether
[25:38.800 --> 25:46.240]  it's arming the rebels or now as we see today a buildup of war planes in cyprus preparations for
[25:46.240 --> 25:50.720]  cruise missile attacks this government the british government has been the keenest of anybody
[25:50.720 --> 25:56.080]  to intervene in syria so so that's why they're not prepared to wait i think they also think
[25:56.640 --> 26:03.040]  that it's unlikely that they will get a resolution passed through the un security council and what
[26:03.040 --> 26:07.360]  will happen then i mean some of the countries are saying that they do not need that mandate from the
[26:07.360 --> 26:14.400]  un security council will they go ahead then will a military action without that well i mean international
[26:14.400 --> 26:20.720]  law is something that um you know people ideally i would have thought before launching a military
[26:20.720 --> 26:26.320]  attack would want to have um and i'm sure that if we do go in for military action without
[26:27.200 --> 26:31.680]  un security council approval it'll be a row that goes on for decades but ultimately
[26:32.320 --> 26:36.720]  international law itself is not going to stop the british and the french and perhaps the americans
[26:36.720 --> 26:41.360]  if they choose to do something well i mean we're also hearing that western powers from the roiders
[26:41.360 --> 26:46.800]  new agency have told the syrian opposition that they will strike within days but does that mean
[26:46.800 --> 26:52.320]  that the decision has already been taken well i think the answer to that is yes i think the
[26:52.320 --> 26:57.040]  british government have made their minds up that's why you've got the buildup in cyprus today
[26:58.000 --> 27:03.840]  parliament's been recalled because i think that throughout the conservative party and indeed
[27:03.840 --> 27:09.760]  throughout very large sections um of the media in britain you know the questions are being asked
[27:09.760 --> 27:14.640]  please prime minister can you tell us what are the aims and objectives of this mission how can
[27:14.640 --> 27:20.800]  you guarantee that we won't become more deeply embroiled and so i'm hoping that in 48 hours time
[27:20.800 --> 27:24.640]  when the british parliament meets we get some answers to those questions but i have to say
[27:25.360 --> 27:30.720]  that ever since tony blair's time starting off with bosnia we seem to go in for foreign wars
[27:30.720 --> 27:37.360]  um with alarming regularity all right having no really clear objectives or any idea that full video
[27:37.360 --> 27:44.160]  is up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com along with analysis text analysis look what's
[27:44.160 --> 27:49.920]  happening here is people say we don't know what the motives are we don't know what the objectives
[27:49.920 --> 27:55.120]  are the objectives are trillions of dollars in weapon sales every year you have to expend the
[27:55.120 --> 28:01.440]  other weapons and then to launch a wider war in the middle east and do encircle russia on record
[28:01.440 --> 28:08.000]  the pentagon and pinac plan to then destabilize that country i mean saudi arabia two days ago on
[28:08.000 --> 28:16.320]  television steve watson wrote an article about it said we will launch our al-qaeda forces
[28:18.080 --> 28:24.080]  against you even called them al-qaeda i mean that now it's almost like this stuff's just all
[28:24.080 --> 28:28.720]  coming out in the open the establishment's like oh you know we run the drugs sure we'll have fox
[28:28.720 --> 28:37.040]  news bbc cnn ms nbc abc nightly news all come out in the same week four years ago and show
[28:37.040 --> 28:45.440]  troops growing it and loading it on aircraft oh you know we run al-qaeda sure we'll just put it
[28:45.440 --> 28:55.280]  on the newspapers big deal it is so lawless and crazy and then it comes out on info wars and
[28:55.280 --> 29:00.320]  then it comes out in mainstream news that oh it looks like the rebels in fact they're reporting
[29:00.320 --> 29:04.720]  today oh we can't prove us i did it and it might actually be the rebels and they go well that's
[29:04.720 --> 29:09.920]  what kerry said i mean he alluded to that see he covered it boy he's smart yeah he's real smart
[29:10.720 --> 29:13.600]  it's like if you wrote a book you could tell somebody what's in it that's not smart you wrote
[29:13.600 --> 29:20.720]  the book i mean he called the place clearly he said it didn't matter days ago yeah he said that
[29:20.720 --> 29:24.960]  because he knew it would come out that they don't have proof and that they're the main suspects
[29:24.960 --> 29:31.760]  it's it's so amazing it's like a war on logic and that's what it is they're just trying to
[29:31.760 --> 29:36.400]  acclimate us with mass Stockholm syndrome that i've talked so much about they haven't learned
[29:36.400 --> 29:42.240]  to helplessness and to have normalcy bias i mean it all comes down to those three terms
[29:42.240 --> 29:46.400]  where we just think this is all normal i'm going to run through what this attack could look like
[29:46.400 --> 29:52.240]  and what it may do to the economy and why they have real motives we're on the march the empires on
[29:52.240 --> 30:02.720]  the right ahead alex jones and the gcn radio network are we choosing our own destiny or has it
[30:02.720 --> 30:07.760]  been pre-selected for us as we've moved through history every great leader has had to understand

[33:34.240 --> 33:38.480]  information is power i'm going to get back into what's happening in syria and how this attack
[33:38.480 --> 33:43.760]  may play out and what it may do to the economy and what other countries are saying they don't want
[33:43.760 --> 33:52.640]  to open the phones up and in this hour we have time if not in the next hour to get your take as
[33:52.640 --> 34:00.480]  listeners on the serious situation but also all the scandals that we are being diverted and
[34:00.480 --> 34:05.760]  distracted with and speaking of those i want to try to cover some of these in the next hour
[34:06.560 --> 34:14.000]  there's a great site know the lies dot com a site where i saw this particular article last week
[34:14.000 --> 34:21.440]  100 articles of impeachment against obama and i've told my crew to mirror this story
[34:21.440 --> 34:27.120]  up on info wars dot com so it gets a wider readership because i read through these hundred
[34:27.120 --> 34:36.720]  and it's a very very accurate 100 articles of impeachment also there's another one freedom outpost
[34:38.480 --> 34:45.840]  did 252 documented examples of barack obama lying lawbreaking corruption cronyism etc because for
[34:45.840 --> 34:54.880]  obama deception too i'm trying to go over the lies and duplicity and the fraud of barack obama
[34:56.480 --> 35:01.520]  as a front man but it's important to study this this figurehead and why they chose him as their
[35:01.520 --> 35:06.160]  logo as their standard as their teleprompter reading marionette
[35:06.160 --> 35:16.800]  and there's just no way to plumb the depths of the hoax just like our government is the illegitimate
[35:16.800 --> 35:22.160]  run by foreign banks that's a giant hoax that we even have a government uh the federal reserve
[35:22.160 --> 35:27.120]  is at federal that's a hoax vaccines in most cases are deadly and don't even protect you
[35:27.120 --> 35:32.800]  their own inserts say it then they run the hoax saying there's no side effects in school handout
[35:32.800 --> 35:37.760]  forms forcing shots through fraud on people not telling them that there's not a law lying and
[35:37.760 --> 35:44.080]  saying there is that's a hoax as pertainment every study out there look it up makes you
[35:44.080 --> 35:49.360]  get incredibly obese and screws up your metabolism and gives you diabetes and all these studies but
[35:49.360 --> 35:55.840]  they have the hoax that it makes you skinny just everything's a hoax with these people
[35:56.480 --> 36:00.880]  and then i'm sitting here trying to decipher it all and figure out what do i put in the film
[36:00.880 --> 36:05.680]  i was up here till 10 30 no actually 11 last night i'm not bragging it's just that there's
[36:05.680 --> 36:09.440]  not enough hours on the day that's why when people call up say you should do this you
[36:09.440 --> 36:14.480]  should do that i'm not mad at the caller but it's like yes i want to do more yes i know
[36:16.240 --> 36:21.920]  i come off like a gibbering moron half the time on radio because sometimes in the morning i'm so
[36:21.920 --> 36:28.320]  burnout and tired that i can't remember you know what i had for breakfast because there's
[36:28.320 --> 36:34.240]  just so much going on i've taken on too much and i'm not complaining about that it's just that in
[36:34.240 --> 36:40.080]  a world of people that halfway pay attention and that just kind of muddle through life i
[36:40.080 --> 36:44.640]  cannot imagine what it's like to not be concerned about the things that are going on in our world
[36:44.640 --> 36:52.160]  and that it's almost bad nowadays to care or to be informed and then i realized people are just
[36:52.160 --> 36:59.600]  delusional i run to so many losers who imagine they're successful and will talk bad about other
[36:59.600 --> 37:06.240]  people who are successful like oh they're gonna fail or they're going down or oh they're not doing
[37:06.240 --> 37:13.120]  too good like it makes them feel good and then they themselves are completely unproductive and
[37:13.120 --> 37:18.800]  unsuccessful and and just wicked and then i look at the good hardworking people not just of america
[37:18.800 --> 37:24.320]  but of the world who are being sucked off of who play by the corrupt rules and i see the ruling
[37:24.320 --> 37:30.160]  establishment who absolutely are at war with them when it's that group that has supplied them
[37:30.160 --> 37:36.640]  with their empire you know when you see obama talk about his legacy you know why did clinton set up
[37:36.640 --> 37:42.720]  and use al qaeda to attack syria and then set them up and lie about and exaggerate massacres and then
[37:42.720 --> 37:46.560]  bombard that country's infrastructure because they had their own aircraft and automobile
[37:46.560 --> 37:53.440]  manufacturing and we're and we're creating a a a corporate and military and mainly uh
[37:53.440 --> 38:00.000]  manufacturing center all over the balkans and we're actually lifting up the entire
[38:01.600 --> 38:07.760]  area same thing with libya libya had come out of the dark investing in africa working with
[38:07.760 --> 38:14.160]  the west building giant airways aquifers literally lifting up the entire african continent and so
[38:14.160 --> 38:17.840]  it's it's now been carpet bombed and the infrastructure has been blown up and it's over
[38:18.960 --> 38:23.600]  and they're in towns all over that place just lining christians blacks you name it up
[38:24.160 --> 38:29.600]  muslim minorities you name it and killing them and that'll never be on the news just that just
[38:30.240 --> 38:36.160]  the fields of dead bodies and skeletons the the fields of burnt bodies the the fields of dead
[38:36.160 --> 38:42.720]  children the the fields of youtube videos showing the jihadis just blacks begging as they're chopped
[38:42.720 --> 38:48.320]  up with uh with with machetes because well it's cheaper than bullets and it's so much fun
[38:49.280 --> 38:54.720]  i mean why shoot you know 200 people in a village when you can take your time watching them beg and
[38:54.720 --> 38:58.880]  hacking them up with uh machetes and the u.s. government's there to help you and there to
[38:58.880 --> 39:04.640]  put you into try to turn the entire country of uh egypt over to you they'll call you protesters
[39:04.640 --> 39:10.400]  when you kill 25 police and one ambush and or turn over syria to you and you know if in two and
[39:10.400 --> 39:15.120]  a half years you can't take down a government well i will just come in with a big military bombardment
[39:19.040 --> 39:25.760]  drudge put out a tweet yesterday that we retweeted at real alex jones
[39:26.480 --> 39:32.000]  saying hey who do you root for in you know the build up this fall to what could be world war three
[39:32.880 --> 39:37.440]  who do you uh in fact maybe pull it up for me guys so i'll read the exact tweet who do you root
[39:37.440 --> 39:43.600]  for this fall do you root for the us nato al qaeda uh Assad the russians the chinese
[39:44.560 --> 39:50.080]  and see that's what it comes down to is that it's just a bunch of crooked governments out of control
[39:50.080 --> 39:55.680]  so you've got to then ask well who's the worst and then you've got to ask well who started all this
[39:55.680 --> 39:59.280]  because under common law and common sense that's who the bad guys are and then it's the big banks
[39:59.280 --> 40:05.520]  that have hijacked europe in the us who have got offshore you know yachts and islands who think they're
[40:05.520 --> 40:10.080]  going to be safe punching that back up i'll read the tweet thank you the guys pulled it up on real
[40:10.080 --> 40:17.520]  alex jones there it is um who to root for rebels al qaeda us a Assad boot in china
[40:19.280 --> 40:24.080]  just a fall preview i mean who do we root for it's all like a football game to americans
[40:25.200 --> 40:29.680]  so many but actually i can't say that anymore it was like a football game with iraq and afghanistan
[40:29.680 --> 40:35.200]  for a while till the suicides went off the charts and the troops came back addicted to opium by design
[40:35.200 --> 40:38.640]  as they were ordered on prescription opiates to crown the pump
[40:41.760 --> 40:47.440]  no now you got nine percent of americans not supporting this so i guess americans aren't as
[40:47.440 --> 40:54.880]  in as big a trance as i thought i guess americans are awake to a great extent but now we see the
[40:54.880 --> 41:02.640]  rogue government who's been attacking syria illegally preemptively aggressively for two and a half years
[41:02.640 --> 41:08.240]  they may not attack this week they may stage some more events to try to build up the idea of hey
[41:08.240 --> 41:15.360]  we've got to act we've got to do something but if they do act what does that signify when the congress
[41:15.360 --> 41:21.360]  they've got democrats now joining republicans like over 70 it was 50 yesterday over 70 members of the
[41:21.360 --> 41:28.560]  house and senators like ran paul and and and ted cruise are coming out saying you will come and
[41:28.560 --> 41:32.960]  get authorization and by the way you don't have the votes we're not going to give it to you but
[41:32.960 --> 41:38.480]  you've got to come to us you can't get that from nato by the way the un won't even authorize this
[41:38.480 --> 41:41.600]  because it's not that they're even a good organization they were set up by the globalists
[41:41.600 --> 41:46.480]  they realized this could cause world war three all the different member states but mainly russia
[41:46.480 --> 41:53.040]  and china and it also will discredit the un if completely if they the us is already discredited
[41:53.040 --> 41:57.360]  the globalists want to have some institutions they control that aren't discredited because
[41:57.360 --> 42:01.600]  remember they want to bring down america too see the globalists are attacking everybody but themselves
[42:02.480 --> 42:08.720]  you've got to understand how full spectrum dominance works from the top of the pyramid
[42:10.240 --> 42:16.400]  the eye of soran is death it's attacking everything i guarantee you folks you could have 20 globalists
[42:16.400 --> 42:22.480]  on a space station you know 20 years from now 15 years from now if they'd nuke the whole earth and
[42:22.480 --> 42:27.360]  you know it was inhabitable and they go up there to the google emergency space station for the elite
[42:27.360 --> 42:30.480]  they say they're building by the way that's mainstream news i don't know they'll build it but
[42:30.480 --> 42:34.480]  they're talking about it and they'll be killing each other over you know who gets the biggest
[42:35.120 --> 42:41.120]  area in the in the in the in the space platform guaranteed that's the nature of these people
[42:41.120 --> 42:47.440]  hell would be being locked with these people forever but we but good people have a giant
[42:47.440 --> 42:54.480]  blind spot to psychopaths and sociopaths because we don't operate like they do well we need to
[42:54.480 --> 42:59.920]  start studying psychopaths and inbred genetic psychopaths like royal families the Rothschilds
[42:59.920 --> 43:05.280]  the Rockefellers all they're doing through the un is setting up their own new royalty where they
[43:05.280 --> 43:09.200]  have diplomatic immunity where they're above the law and now i'll tell this story and then get into
[43:09.200 --> 43:12.800]  the news and then give the number out and take your calls next hour we've got a bunch of special
[43:12.800 --> 43:22.800]  reports as well this is how being above the law comes back on you because once you create a super
[43:22.800 --> 43:30.560]  class that is above the law the minions and the enforcers of that superclass they're going to want
[43:30.560 --> 43:40.560]  and relish the knighthoods the un directorships the uh un uh judgeships the the the bureaucratic
[43:40.560 --> 43:45.280]  agenda 21 directorships and they're going to want their own little empires and be greedy
[43:47.600 --> 43:52.480]  and that's why tyranny's always grow grow grow grow grow and the globalists think with robots
[43:52.480 --> 43:57.520]  and computers and automation and centralization and compartmentalization they're going to keep
[43:57.520 --> 44:07.360]  control of the parasite bloom that always comes politically on the micro and the macro from a
[44:07.360 --> 44:11.280]  development like this and they really they've written countless books admitting this themselves
[44:13.120 --> 44:18.720]  but here's a microcosm example you can pull up the statistics you see it in the news all the time
[44:18.720 --> 44:26.720]  about police chases and police riding tickets being the number one cause of death for police
[44:27.360 --> 44:32.720]  and one of the most dangerous things statistically i saw numbers a few years ago in the LA Times that
[44:32.720 --> 44:38.320]  police involve crashes kill more people than drunk driving some years the two numbers are neck and
[44:38.320 --> 44:43.600]  neck and to give you an example of this if you're out on a saturday night in areas you will see
[44:43.600 --> 44:46.800]  dangerous drunk drivers it's scary they're reckless driver they should be arrested you know
[44:46.800 --> 44:51.600]  sweet you know woven around that's probable gospel mother spell alcohol boom you know you go to jail
[44:51.600 --> 44:59.120]  you're right there but i said you drink one beer now and they went down to point five whatever
[44:59.120 --> 45:10.240]  and take you to jail but talking about police this morning 750 i'm about to leave to go jog and then
[45:10.240 --> 45:19.040]  come to work try to get here about 930 or so and the nanny calls up we have a nanny because my wife
[45:19.680 --> 45:24.160]  home schools comes like three days a week really nice lady workforce for many years very sweet
[45:24.160 --> 45:30.400]  young lady she's crying i'm going to say her name on her for a privacy and she's been rear-ended
[45:32.480 --> 45:33.200]  so um
[45:36.000 --> 45:41.120]  and of course the person didn't have insurance i didn't check well over there i look like an
[45:41.120 --> 45:44.880]  illegal alien but the point is she was acting like i didn't really speak English the point is
[45:44.880 --> 45:50.240]  is that she's pulled up there in a church parking lot so i go you know to start dealing with that
[45:50.240 --> 45:54.000]  and she's crying about it because it smashed from the back and i said what happened well these
[45:54.000 --> 46:01.040]  cops shot by and so everybody just slammed on their brakes because the cops came driving basically
[46:01.040 --> 46:08.560]  through the median two cop cars and then she saw after she wrecked they just pulled somebody over
[46:09.120 --> 46:13.360]  they were just going to give somebody a ticket and so they pulled over and caused a bunch of cars
[46:13.360 --> 46:19.120]  to run into each other it was out on uh out on 290 the police know about it they're listening
[46:19.120 --> 46:23.040]  the wrecker isn't all out there the cops pulled out in front of people so they all pulled over
[46:23.040 --> 46:27.520]  because god had arrived and ran into each other and smashed each other's cars some of the cars
[46:27.520 --> 46:34.400]  couldn't even drive off and be put on records so i'm driving in at 9 10 this morning on 290 again
[46:35.520 --> 46:41.760]  i'm driving on 290 a few miles past that and i see up under the first street road
[46:42.800 --> 46:48.000]  first street overpass on 290 then white as it's known i see the motorcycle cop that's there
[46:48.000 --> 46:53.680]  200 days or more out of the year they're almost always there whenever i have to work of course
[46:53.680 --> 46:59.920]  i'm on cruise control because i know that i'm going 70 and there's a car 50 yards ahead of me
[46:59.920 --> 47:03.760]  that they were like they were going more than 72 miles an hour or whatever because i you know saw
[47:03.760 --> 47:14.160]  the car it's like a black Acura and i see him jump on his motorcycle and as i pass him and zoom
[47:14.160 --> 47:21.280]  right up behind me and then he zooms out and i'm getting ready to tell him how there's fluoride
[47:21.280 --> 47:24.640]  in the water killing him and look into the bio weapon programs and the vaccines and the new
[47:24.640 --> 47:28.400]  order i'm actually looking and i'm i'm getting ready to get my phone so i can erase some videos
[47:28.400 --> 47:35.280]  because it's full i think i gotta do that i gotta download these and then he's he's behind me about
[47:35.280 --> 47:43.200]  20 seconds then he turns out and zooms up behind this woman who's now he's behind me i slow down
[47:43.200 --> 47:49.280]  about 65 she's now about 500 yards ahead of me and there's cameras all out there if the cops
[47:49.280 --> 47:52.720]  want to watch this course they know they're probably just celebrated or something give each other an
[47:52.720 --> 47:58.080]  award for it and he runs up behind her starts going like this pull over to the medium everybody
[47:58.080 --> 48:00.880]  knows you don't pull over the medium but they do it up on 290 because that's the bigger shoulder
[48:01.600 --> 48:06.960]  so she starts pulling over to the other side and he recklessly pulls out in front of more cars
[48:06.960 --> 48:14.160]  in the four lanes and they all slam their brakes on and i almost run into them
[48:15.520 --> 48:20.240]  and then he gets her to pull over and as i look back he's just angrily getting off his motorcycle
[48:20.240 --> 48:27.520]  to go chew her out and this is my day i mean i'm driving to work and people i know are crying
[48:27.520 --> 48:32.960]  and their cars are smashed up and records and police and and other but i'm just like dodging cops
[48:32.960 --> 48:41.760]  man i mean i'm just dodging this this thing that kills as many people on average as drunk drivers
[48:43.440 --> 48:47.280]  but you don't ever hear hubbub and freaking out about it you don't see big police billboards you
[48:47.280 --> 48:51.760]  know like with the dwi click at her ticket or if you drink drive go to jail we're watching you
[48:51.760 --> 48:55.920]  with you know 10 different types of cops pointing their fingers at you like we live in north korea
[48:55.920 --> 49:03.840]  or something and i remember in miami watching the deputy chief when a woman had a first amendment
[49:03.840 --> 49:07.840]  sign out of a legal and lawful demonstration a few years ago and they it's famous and they
[49:07.840 --> 49:11.440]  shoot her in the face with rubber bullets and damage her eyes she's bleeding and crying
[49:12.160 --> 49:16.320]  and then it shows the deputy chief afterwards with all these swat team guys and all these people in
[49:16.320 --> 49:21.680]  battle gear darth vader outfits going i loved it when you shot that lady in the face and they all
[49:21.680 --> 49:25.840]  laugh about it let me tell you something the cops now that i said this may actually go pull the video
[49:25.840 --> 49:30.960]  of this motorcycle cop which wasn't even that reckless compared to what happened to our nanny
[49:30.960 --> 49:36.400]  this morning uh i mean it's just borderline i guarantee you they'll laugh about it look at
[49:36.400 --> 49:40.640]  how scared they are you know what you're gonna get calls a lot of you cops and i'm sad to say
[49:40.640 --> 49:44.320]  this this could happen to any parent i pray to god never happens to mind that your son or daughter's
[49:44.320 --> 49:50.160]  gonna die in a car wreck and uh you know maybe maybe they're gonna be paralyzed you know you're
[49:50.160 --> 49:56.240]  gonna get to change their diapers for the rest of your life now see god doesn't even really judge
[49:56.240 --> 50:02.240]  you you engage in evil and then your family's gonna be killed by cops come like that guy who
[50:02.240 --> 50:07.600]  was a cop out in LA and they released the video for 10 minutes while they torture and beat his
[50:07.600 --> 50:11.600]  mentally ill son to death who didn't even resist them and the cops are getting off on a begging
[50:11.600 --> 50:16.720]  you see when he begs please daddy help me and the cops go and start getting on top of him
[50:16.720 --> 50:22.000]  they're gonna kill they're gonna kill they're gonna kill your kids are gonna die at the hands of police
[50:22.720 --> 50:27.680]  and that's why the new world order says they want a chip or they want that id card where they're
[50:27.680 --> 50:35.120]  above the law left alone that's what in in california alone almost a million people government bureaucrats
[50:35.120 --> 50:40.080]  and police have immunity last time i saw the san francisco chronicle it's more now undoubtedly
[50:40.080 --> 50:44.560]  where they don't get tickets they can run red lights they're above the law so see that's that
[50:44.560 --> 50:49.200]  now you're hoping you can do that but it won't matter the system is going to kill your children

[54:27.040 --> 54:33.040]  know you sacrifice your child to the new world order just like when you have an abortion why not
[54:33.040 --> 54:38.160]  join a satanic church get pregnant go have abortions for satan and that's what you're doing
[54:38.160 --> 54:44.960]  why not really get into who you are it's all about how you're above the law and see that
[54:44.960 --> 54:52.160]  my was my analogy and i started talking about the case of uh kelly thomas whose dad was a retired
[54:52.160 --> 54:55.920]  police officer and they just come up to him and say what are you doing he goes i'm doing nothing
[54:55.920 --> 55:00.480]  so they start beating him up and then they just kill him slow i mean of course you jump on somebody's
[55:00.480 --> 55:05.680]  neck and have five guys shit on you and they suffocated him he get daddy daddy he says it over
[55:05.680 --> 55:10.880]  and over again and they take their time and they kill him and all his teeth are knocked out his face
[55:10.880 --> 55:16.480]  is crushed in and they they beat him and beat him and beat him and i i you know i mean i think that's
[55:16.480 --> 55:24.880]  a sacrament to government kelly thomas and when i think about him begging for his daddy and i think

[55:32.320 --> 55:36.240]  they teach the cops the threat continuum you know if you're hurting somebody and they resist
[55:36.240 --> 55:39.600]  involuntarily well we'll just show them and then more cops show up and they beat him in the face

[56:51.120 --> 56:56.720]  and fluoride and bash your brains out in fact those cops are doing that i remember seeing
[56:56.720 --> 57:00.320]  them once they got arrested later because they lied about it and all came out i mean they just look
[57:00.320 --> 57:07.840]  like total idiot thugs gang members that wanted to go have a job where where you know you can run
[57:07.840 --> 57:13.440]  your motorcycle up on people you can scream at families you can whip out in front of cars make
[57:13.440 --> 57:19.200]  people wreck and you're in control so nobody's going to get in trouble now i'm not even attacking
[57:19.200 --> 57:21.920]  the police here there were the rubber meets the road there are a lot of good police that are
[57:21.920 --> 57:30.640]  abhorring you know absolutely abhor things like this the issue here the issue here and what makes
[57:30.640 --> 57:36.240]  this so sick and rips my guts out is the globalists are doing this on a mass scale all over the world
[57:36.240 --> 57:41.920]  in our name and blaming people for things that they've done and it shows how what comes around
[57:41.920 --> 57:50.480]  goes around just like that young man who was killed by the police tortured to death just like
[57:50.480 --> 57:58.400]  his dad was a decorated 26 year veteran retired from a police department nearby and he came out to
[57:58.400 --> 58:02.240]  the police are now totally evil because they are getting more brutal because they're soldiers now
[58:02.240 --> 58:06.000]  what it shows you they fight enemies and if you're a schizophrenic guy you're gonna die
[58:06.720 --> 58:11.200]  because you're the enemy these are warriors who gang up on a schizophrenic guy that weighs 140
[58:11.200 --> 58:19.920]  pounds you're tough you can kill people the point is is that you killed a god's child see what what
[58:19.920 --> 58:25.840]  you do to other people comes back on you i see articles all the time where cops run into a thing
[58:25.840 --> 58:30.160]  and kill a cop's daughter i saw a story like that like a month ago and it's in the news like oh it
[58:30.160 --> 58:34.960]  killed a cop's daughter so then they get the cop in trouble but only because you killed a cop's

[59:57.760 --> 01:00:11.840]  radio network big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:31.920]  so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:54.800]  by the way i played this clip today again it goes on for 30 plus minutes actually
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:58.880]  that takes them about 15 minutes to kill him and then they kind of have a celebration after
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:04.640]  they've killed him uh but uh a follower in california police department murdered
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:10.480]  unarmed homeless man uh and of course this happened uh last year i was just telling the
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:17.040]  story about how this guy was a police officer's son and so they didn't die at the cops but only
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:22.720]  because the dad was a cop and i've noticed that when they kill your kid folks and what sick is
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.920]  they're they're sitting on each hand and on his legs by the end it's eight cops and they're saying
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:32.480]  he's saying i can't breathe daddy daddy and they just keep beating his brains out
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:36.480]  and his whole body and knocking every tooth out and they keep saying just put your hands behind
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:42.560]  your back i love that like they go don't resist and then taser you and then taser you till you die
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:48.320]  and and you're just sitting there and then in america they taser you if you don't answer questions
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:53.680]  now the courts have said they can do that it's torture i mean if they had guys in abu graib tazering
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:02:00.800]  them they call it torture and it just shows what a sick system we are and my point is do police
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:05.440]  really want to grow up in a country where they're run by foreign banks and the people of their
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:14.080]  enemies and they consider us insurgents and they kill 95 year old man because you know he's not doing
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:21.280]  what nurses are telling him and he has a shoehorn in his hand and they say it's okay i mean it and
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:26.240]  again this isn't how the police were in the past this is how they act in authoritarian regimes
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:31.440]  this is what they want and my point was what comes around goes around that's why i mentioned
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:37.360]  the case of kelly thomas if they walk over to him and they say what are you doing and it turned out
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:41.040]  he'd done nothing wrong he's sitting there and he's schizophrenic and he goes nothing i'm just
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:46.160]  sitting here so they start grabbing on him and they start then they jump on top of me says hey man
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:51.760]  stop that and then they just kill him then he's and you can see in the video we're showing their
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:56.000]  original one that got released by locals to turn out they had the surveillance tapes at the cops
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.440]  slides that they didn't have but turned out people inside the department released them
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:05.360]  if you follow that case and uh the reason they got indicted i haven't followed they got convicted
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:11.760]  yet um was because they they lied and said oh he kept resisting oh just like the guy on the
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:16.720]  dart platform they made a movie about it who wasn't even the guy that was in a fight and they put him
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.240]  in handcuffs he's not resisting and then they just shoot him in the back just got pulled the gun out
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:27.040]  boom and they take all the cell phones away cop got a year for it except one person in a
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:33.600]  uh in a train that stopped and it drives off as the cops look and they get the footage out
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.880]  they said he attacked the police just like the fbi shot one of the zarnev brothers friends
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:43.280]  who knew that that he was cia they said oh he attacked him turn out well he didn't attack him
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:48.240]  and it's national security we shot him in the back of the head though we just we just killed him and
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:52.960]  that's just the way it is show you just get used to that because because we're the guys in charge
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:58.560]  we're the winners you're only the winners for a season because america's being brought down
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:03.600]  and the globalist plan a red terror in this nation that's why the army manual that we've
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:09.840]  been reporting on since monday openly has come out and said that the founding fathers are bad
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:17.040]  people and due process and freedom is bad i didn't mean to digress off into this point today it's
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:22.640]  just that i was thinking of examples of blowback where what the corrupt system does comes back on
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:30.080]  it oh throughout history when tyrants uh bring in tyranny and ends up destroying them and well
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:35.920]  you guys print me the article about little leagues are seen as racist in california uh i saw an article
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:40.960]  where they're banning them uh because i i saw that it was a washington times i couldn't believe it
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:45.200]  two days ago but i ever covered it i wanted to mention that by the way we have a leon macadoon
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:51.280]  report austinites did sign petitions to ban the word father and mother and family and brown bag

[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:17.200]  man i tell you i was watching msnbc last night during a break up here editing
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:23.440]  and i mean it was like an absurdist cartoon of race bait pushing they've just totally turned
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:29.360]  martin leuther king day and his dream speech of the opposite and it was legalize all the illegals

[01:09:54.400 --> 01:10:00.240]  attacks that's the new york times washington's blog boils down a whole section of that i mean
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:06.160]  this is just a criminal rogue group that won't even put their name on it but it shows how it's a
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:12.000]  rogue shadow corporate dilderberg style government is just pushing this and then there's not even
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.400]  proof given and carry three days ago it's like it doesn't matter who launched it a sod's horrible
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:21.040]  it's all about a sod not about the hundreds of thousands that have been killed by the west
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:28.000]  injecting the rebels and calling them protesters so here's some of these headlines and then i'm
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:35.200]  going to go to a special uh report syrian hypocrisy with david night and then obama is
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:40.240]  saying he hasn't made a decision yet on syria uh we're going to be breaking that down iotola the
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:48.240]  head of uh iran supreme leader says dire consequences if the united states strikes syria
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:55.760]  syria sparks worries iran could launch proxy war if syria is struck i mean what do you think the west
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:59.840]  has done it's a proxy war and you're like well i don't like iranians folks what do you even know
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:05.520]  about that if you're a new listener please go watch my film terror storm that came out in 2006
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:09.840]  you notice it talks about how the cia stage terror attacks brought on the muslim extremist
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:15.680]  in 1953 that was declassified last week it's already declassified for that they just declassified
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:20.800]  a little more and they staged false flags to do it and blame the government and then put
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:25.040]  the jihadis in for a few weeks to stabilize things so people that would then beg for the shaw
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:30.960]  then they took him out in 79 but the iotola back in did the hostages deal with them the shadow
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:36.880]  government did to set up carter then gave them weapons i mean this is unbelievable i mean i mean
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:42.800]  did i ran ever invade multiple times and put foreigners in to take it over did i mean i mean
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:48.560]  did i ran over take over the u.s no everybody just loves to hate them because they look different
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:53.760]  than us and the truth is our stinking new world order government literally put these people in
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:12:00.000]  just like they created saddam they actually ran him until the end with the with the shiites they
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.920]  don't really run them they just wind them up and you know put them in charge kind of like opening
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:12.400]  the gates so the kraken can go out and destroy japa but continuing here iotola threatens dire
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:18.960]  consequences if u.s strikes syria that is really important uh humanitarian intervention in syria
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:24.480]  will increase civilian deaths and being sarcastic there are the monkey cages their blog military
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:28.480]  intervention on the side of rebels increase civilian deaths by 40 and it goes over just
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:35.040]  just just just what the last few years has done there yeah hundreds of thousands of dead on syria
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:41.200]  obama says he's eyeing shot across the bow and a shot across the bow will be maybe a hundred
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:46.000]  cruise missiles get launched that's probably what they're leaning towards blow up some power stations
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.840]  blow up some infrastructure blow up some military bases it's hard to get their al-qaeda through with
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:56.720]  suicide bombers to blow up the military and police bases so i mean that'll be what it is
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:01.840]  just so they can then see six months from now you know a year a year from now
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:07.920]  that'll be three and a half years into the war we're two and a half plus right now see we got
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:12.720]  to do something it's like yeah what's going on with that it's our job to go help those syrians
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:16.800]  against that Assad guy when the whole thing's manufactured by the same globalist that have
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:22.560]  occupied america and are running us into the ground and obama's legacy is he wants to prove
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:28.160]  he's the most ruthless bloodthirsty cunning manipulator to get obama care through for the
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:33.600]  big banks to raise taxes on everybody including the poorest and put in death panels and and and
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:39.200]  create government control for eugenics over health care and absolutely destroy small businesses and
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:43.600]  give waivers to all the big businesses that are part of the inside globalist club and then sit
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:50.400]  there smiling as he cons his poor victim constituents and then takes the blame for the whole agenda so
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:56.480]  the next puppet can be brought forward and he wants what bush got and what clinton got and what
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:02.960]  every other president does targeting another piece of the global risk board to say i got another
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:07.760]  piece for the new world order and there's only six or seven big nations left they haven't taken down
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:16.240]  worldwide they've taken them all down ladies and gentlemen and they're continuing to move forward
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:21.280]  so that no one can oppose the global government no one has powerful weapons to oppose them so they
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:27.920]  can then fund rebel groups to then fully bring down the governments so the globalist can bombard
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:34.480]  them but most of the time they take over financially bring in corporate unified as in 21
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:40.320]  over land medical religion uh infrastructure military it's global standardization global
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:45.920]  regulatory law that the globalists are exempt from to then come in and force hundreds of shots
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:50.560]  every year it'll just kill everybody and then everybody wonder why everybody's dying and you
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:53.920]  know if you speak out and say it's the government you'll be arrested as a troublemaker that's their
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:58.160]  plan they said they want to arrest people that you know say this is happening you're mad about
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:03.040]  fluoride you just paramilitary group comes and kills you because it's you know a death squad
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:07.760]  for freedom i mean the the the nanny state's liberal they're not tyrants they love you they
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:15.920]  say it in a soft npr voice so we've got that going on and once they have this in worldwide i mean
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:21.280]  katie bar the door that's when the real depopulation starts but they want to mop everything up first
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:25.680]  before they release the bio weapons and blame it on terrorists and then bring in a greater police
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:30.480]  state through that crisis and then a few years later release another bio weapon and oh you know
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:35.520]  here's the guy that did it and you know he's an evil patriot scientist and we're gonna we're gonna
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:41.200]  execute him and oh a billion died when he released the the white plague or whatever they'll call it
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:49.040]  this is the whole program and then further deindustrialized with the robots and automation
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:55.120]  replacing you where you absolutely have to go on the dole with robots tending the fields and
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:16:00.560]  producing the food that you get from the government or from the corporate combine with the government
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:06.800]  contract so that you are absolutely a slave in a prison dumbed down and poisoned before they wipe
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:12.080]  everybody out and you want to know why they attack me in movies and they've got comic books coming
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:17.760]  out where the bad guy you know in marvel comics is an evil right wing patriot leader and it's my
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:23.200]  face 100% fact you probably show that they've got movies coming out you know where the villain is
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:29.440]  alex jones they've got uh we're actually called alex jones they've got at least 10 shows i've
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:35.120]  seen the last decade on different cable networks where there's a bad patriot in texas broadcasting
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:41.280]  who sounds exactly like i do who then gets blown up by the atf i mean they've got one script they

[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:54.960]  if people find out what this master plan is folks it's game over so so people ask me
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:04.080]  why do i not have fear it's because look i only have fear that i won't do a good job exposing
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:09.120]  these people i know their program i know their operation i know where it goes i know there's
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:15.120]  no future for my family it would be a crime if i didn't expend every bit of energy i have i would
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:23.440]  be aiding and abetting the enemy in this eugenics global rewrite takeover total hegemon the takeover
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:28.160]  of reality the takeover of the genetic code the takeover of creation by these devilish forces if
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:34.560]  i didn't fully tell you what they're really up to if i just played patty cake with the new world
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:38.800]  order and just kind of halfway faded off or whatever or whatever i became a big mainstream
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:43.680]  talk show host i would be sentencing my children and their grandchildren do a total nightmare and

[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:03.600]  a hundred percent two hundred percent three hundred percent four hundred percent five hundred
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:08.480]  percent you already noticed most people can't hardly talk now the icues are plunging they're
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:13.600]  being programmed by the television the ipads the brains have been rewired neurological disorders
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:18.960]  are off the charts people are turning off folks people are under high tech mind control with the
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:27.120]  chemicals the biologicals the radiologicals and and we're going in to a new world order program
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:32.560]  where they think they're saving the earth doing this to destroy the scourge the infestation of
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:36.640]  seven and a half billion humans on the planet and undoubtedly a lot of the technologies are dirty
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:41.040]  there are many areas that are overpopulated but there are many areas that aren't like the west
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:48.080]  is imploding having a birth rate replacement of 1.3 on average so for every two adults there are
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:52.720]  ways to move forward and fix this but the globalists don't want to transfer the clean new energy
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:57.200]  systems to people because that would destroy their monopoly see they don't have full government yet
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:01.680]  full world government yet to carry their plans out they argue well they could get all this in
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:07.120]  and and take out their competition that then they could try to fix things but their plan to fix
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:11.840]  things is just to kill everybody and then i study the individual globalists and how they operate
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:16.320]  they're all just a bunch of sadists murdering control freaks who love going to
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:21.680]  dinners every night in white ties being given awards and worshiped and wearing crowns on their

[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:18.960]  a war on for your mind all right we're gonna go to a david night report almost happening with syria
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:25.360]  and if you're a new listener and hear these things i'm talking about and it is shocking to you
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:32.160]  i know reality is crazy but if you look at what other rulers and emperors have done that's all
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:39.840]  crazy that we're in 2013 the world is a bizarre place our government is funding al-qaeda our
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:44.400]  government has been overrun and seized by the globalist they are trying to teach fifth graders
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:52.320]  about incredibly sexually graphic things in public schools msnbc is saying that the state's
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:56.640]  going to take over your children and that's a good thing all of this craziness is really happening
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:04.640]  they're just normalizing you for the change to absolutely flip everything on its head this is
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:11.360]  a war against humanity by a globalist technocracy that believes that there are different species
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:15.680]  than us they say that in their own words that they're really human and we're not and they see us as
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:23.360]  animals can be fed on let's go to david night's report syrian hypocrisy this is about the large
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:30.960]  scale indiscriminate use of weapons that the civilized world long ago decided must never be used
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:37.360]  at all the supposed use of sarin gas in syria is now being used as a pretext for war but when did
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:43.520]  the civilized world decide that sarin gas shouldn't be used and how different is sarin gas from the
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:48.800]  weapons of mass destruction that the civilized world wants to use on innocent syrian civilians
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:54.400]  developed by the nazi zone ig farben creators of zyklon b used for mass murder and concentration
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:26:00.560]  camps sarin gas was a standard chemical military weapon of both the us and the ussr and in the
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:06.320]  1950s it was adopted by nato as a standard chemical weapon the u.s military industrial
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:12.240]  complex made a science out of sarin delivery pictured here is the m134 bomblet designed for
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:18.080]  the m190 honest john rocket warhead the bomblets carried sarin nerve agent and were released
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:24.880]  5000 feet above their target saturating an area 1000 meters in diameter with sarin gas does syria
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:31.440]  possess anything like that but of course it was okay because we had it it defies any code of
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:37.920]  morality let me be clear the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians the killing of women
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:44.800]  and children and innocent bystanders by chemical weapons is a moral obscenity after using and
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:51.600]  weaponizing sarin gas for over 40 years the us signed a treaty in 1993 to ban its use five years
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:57.120]  later cnn and time magazine both broke a story about the us's use of sarin gas during vietnam
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:02.240]  and the firestorm of controversy cnn and time fired the reporters and declared the story false
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:07.760]  however the reporters pushed back with a 77 page document backing up their allegations
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:13.440]  and april oliver won a one million dollar lawsuit against cnn but just the presence of sarin gas
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:18.800]  in syria regardless of whether it was used by the rebels by the cia and jordanian commandos that
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:23.280]  lafiguero reported entered syria a couple of weeks earlier or whether it was actually the syrian
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:29.120]  government the use of chemical weapons is supposed to be justification for the u.s military industrial
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:34.320]  complex to rain death down on tens or hundreds of times more innocent men women and children
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:38.960]  than were killed in this attack but chemical weapons experts not affiliated with the u.s
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:44.720]  government have cast doubt on whether sarin was actually the chemical used 500 times more toxic
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:49.520]  than cyanide it can kill within one minute and it will kill first responders who don't wear
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:54.480]  protective clothing that this apparently didn't happen makes it doubtful that the chemical used
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:28:00.800]  was sarin and how does sarin gas compare to weapons that the u.s has used and continues to use
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:06.400]  millions of gallons of agent orange were dropped in vietnam during the war nearly 50 years later
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:12.080]  three generations later it is still showing up in horrible birth defects and it didn't just
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:16.560]  affect vietnamese civilians american soldiers are dying from cancer and having difficulty
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:22.320]  getting the u.s government to accept responsibility having to fight one by one against the va and
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:27.200]  the u.s continues to use weapons that would mean a slow death sentence for those who survive the war
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:32.800]  both u.s soldiers and foreign citizens that would be depleted uranium and about the same
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:37.920]  time the u.s agreed to ban the use of sarin gas it reversed its policy and began exposing
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:45.120]  u.s soldiers to depleted uranium like agent orange it is also a persistent poison killing slowly

[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:59.920]  crime but also by the cynical attempt to cover it up the american government's hypocrisy over the
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:05.600]  use of weapons of mass destruction is a stench before heaven that they would use this to justify
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:11.200]  the murder of tens of thousands more people is what should offend our sense of humanity

[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:26.720]  all right i want to finish up with a couple headlines on the stereo
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:30.800]  is really newspapers are reporting and it's now been confirmed that the
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:36.800]  un inspectors are being pulled out of the country on saturday and then as soon as they're out of
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:44.400]  the country by helicopter back to the cia command bases where al-qaeda is based in jordan and iraq
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:49.920]  and other areas that they are going to start a cruise missile bombardment and and that's what
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:56.240]  a lot of us news is saying i don't know if that's the case i don't know if that's true but if he
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:34:03.120]  does do that this is clearly just a wag the dog you know tail wagging the dog case of where remember
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:10.560]  clinton fired like a hundred cruise missiles off at a aspirin factory uh when the drudge report
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:15.600]  was exposing i mean to show how these are just people were fighting the drudge report
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:21.440]  was pointing out that clinton had lied about monica lawinsky and then talk radio picked up on
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:28.160]  and i remember i was covering at the time uh and they then freaked out and he missile attacked
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:34.160]  a pharmaceutical company factory saying it was a chemical weapons lab remember that
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:45.680]  and uh that was uh in the middle of africa and then they had also what was it operation
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:50.640]  fox where they attacked iraq with cruise missiles i mean this is the type of stuff they do
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:58.800]  do and then it also serves as oh look we are going to need to you know do something because
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:03.040]  there'll be another attack and this has been going on for years come on we got to have a strike we
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:08.400]  got to help the syrian children and the average american doesn't know that our government is hijacked
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:14.960]  that our government staged it and so they think they'll go along with it but the incredible news
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:19.920]  that i should be jumping for joy over i should in fact we should be popping champagne i've only
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:29.520]  done this one other time here on air that was four years ago the copenhagen meeting to push a world
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:34.000]  government tax the document came out and at the same time the the hacked emails got released
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.800]  that they confirmed were real where the un was organizing a lie to hide that the world was cooling
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:43.200]  and that they knew it was about global taxes and eugenics and cutting off the third world
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:47.200]  and not letting them develop and then shutting down development in the west as well but really
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:51.360]  targeting the third world and that it wasn't to help the third world so everybody turned against
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:55.920]  it i had the crew on that sunday broadcast go get champagne we drank champagne on the air
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:02.000]  one time in 18 years and i really just had the the understanding that the fact that americans
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:10.160]  conservative libertarian liberal whatever term they call themselves have nine percent approval rating
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:20.880]  for this is champagne level i mean regardless of what happens it shows that
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:30.640]  people are really really starting to get it and it's incredibly positive
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:33.920]  and there's a lot of other positive stuff happening
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:40.480]  and i talked to a lot of police and a lot of military which are again where the river meets
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:46.080]  the road in the establishment and they're waking up and school teachers i talked to are waking up
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:51.280]  the bureaucracy is waking up and really getting that this isn't all being done for our good
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.440]  and they they give us cover stories for why we're doing what we're doing but
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:00.880]  in the final equation it is to consolidate power by a bunch of above the law globalist
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:06.880]  and people are tired of it 800 2 5 9 9 2 3 1 i know the phone lines are loaded but i wanted to
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:11.680]  give the number out it's open phones i kind of said on syria but i mentioned police earlier
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:17.120]  now more and more cops are having their kids killed by cops and i've noticed a trend where
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:21.600]  when that happens the cops actually get charged so i was talking about how that's almost the new
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:26.960]  royalty and how all over the country the police and bureaucrats the face scanning cameras can't
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:33.600]  identify them the license plate readers can't identify them the systems can't and they can't
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:38.160]  really be given tickets now it's coming out you can't even enter their info in the police
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:42.720]  computers in california and last time i checked it was almost a million in the san francisco
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:47.680]  chronicle was asking is this a bad idea and now it's reached epic proportions a few weeks ago i was
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:54.640]  reading where it's just insane and can you imagine if the bureaucrats are above the law can you
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:59.680]  imagine the mega bankers and everybody else this is lawlessness and the only thing holding things
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:05.200]  back right now is the morality of individuals that's left and that's why the system assaults
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:11.440]  morality if you go read declassified this stuff came out in the 50s 60s and 70s different you
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:15.200]  know famous communist goals and agenda you can just search that term and see different ones
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:21.520]  read in the correctional record and then about a decade ago they began to release the kgb and nkvd
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:26.560]  files there were lots of headlines like McCarthy was right and stuff like that about communist
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:32.400]  infiltration and in those it says we want to get people having sex at a young age so they don't
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:38.080]  have a family and never you know cement a bond because the family is a threat for our collectivist
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:45.360]  state system we want to get people on drugs we want to you know on and on and on turn groups
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:50.640]  against each other we don't want people going to church but but we want to push atheist ideas but
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:56.480]  also simultaneously infiltrate the churches as atheists to then put out our message and it's just
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:02.000]  unbelievable and they infiltrated the catholics folks that's what's going on there with all that
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:09.520]  craziness they infiltrated the protestants you name it and now at baptist churches they're saying
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:15.680]  turn in your guns you know the southern baptist convention and others you know war is good do
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:21.520]  what the government says take the shots their clergy response team it's a state-run system
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:28.160]  i said i'd go to your calls it's just that there are so many things going on so many incredible
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:34.160]  things that are happening and and it shows how this program and how the public schools have
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:39.200]  been able to do this and now they federalize with standardization if you want to be accredited to go
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:46.480]  to college the private schools most of them over 90 percent folks you're not going to go to college
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:52.720]  and get a job unless it's as a bureaucrat or homeland security i mean it's over there's not
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:59.360]  going to be jobs america's done you go spend a half million dollars on all the loans you take
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:05.360]  you know quarter million to get a four-year degree half a million to get a phd or a or a
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:12.480]  medical doctorate and and all the metrics show maybe five percent will end up making money with it
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:18.000]  it's over it's over if the new world order is allowed to continue it's done okay it's all the
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:22.320]  fraud it didn't matter if your kids go to school now as long as they know about the new world order
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:26.880]  know how to read and write and know how to fix a toilet mow a yard and have good interpersonal
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:31.680]  skills so people learn they're honorable that's the most valuable thing in business in life
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:36.320]  is people knowing you do what you say you're going to do people knowing you don't stab people in
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:41.680]  the back people knowing you're a good person people knowing you're hardworking that was always the
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:46.880]  most valuable thing and that is the most valuable thing today more than ever as society falls apart
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:50.080]  because everybody wants to be a movie star everybody wants to be a rock star because they
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:57.760]  think that narcissistically they're going to be successful if they could just pass into the
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:01.920]  promised land and be some type of celebrity i'm here to tell you folks i know a lot of big
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:06.560]  celebrities bigger than charlie sheen bigger than a lot of the ones you've heard on this show
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:12.720]  bigger than vego mortensen bigger than you name it as big as it gets folks and they are the most
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:19.520]  unhappy miserable mentally ill looking at themselves in the mirror all day people that you could
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:24.160]  imagine talking about charlie until he went off the rails he was a really smart great guy he's still
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:29.920]  a good guy we pray for him and his family does as well the point is is that there is nothing else
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:34.880]  let me tell you what there is there's your kids growing up healthy and happy and being successful
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:40.320]  and having children and continuing and being decent people who have a good family name having
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:50.400]  children and them being members of society that stand for good that is total societal cultural
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:57.760]  and biological success that is it not being invaded not being overrun not being a slave
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:02.640]  that is always the great goal is thomas jefferson said to go be the yeoman farmer that's why they
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:07.440]  all wanted to leave washington and go be farmers out on their cool farms and you know out there
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:12.000]  with the bees flying around and out there hunting because they were real men that had been in wars
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:17.760]  and sale disease and and they spoke five languages and and were into being what it really is to be
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:24.000]  human and they said in the councils of government is a joke henry kissinger and his stupid you know
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:31.840]  consort going into events dressed up in tuxedos they're a joke but we let these jokes run our world

[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:16.160]  scary to know that they've got the evil forces they need to disappear a lot of us and these people
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:23.520]  will sit back in and and will salute it because it feels powerful to be part of darkness it feels
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:29.040]  good at a spiritual level to them because they're so spiritually blind all they've got is evil and
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:34.640]  so as they get towards more deeper evil they feel the power because they're so powerless that even
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:40.320]  though evil is a much you know resonates as a much less powerful thing than good they're so weak
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:45.040]  that's all that's ever been projected at them and it's also coated in good so on the surface of
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:48.880]  their mind they're like it's good but they'll like bite their lip and get twinkles in their eye

[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:48.400]  um when i first started uh driving uh pretty much i've gone through um i went through a
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:53.200]  stop sign at one point that police officer pulled me over asking for my driver's license gave it to
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:56:00.560]  him uh and uh asked me to step out of the vehicle because you know i i look Hispanic so he stereotype

[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:08.320]  controlled bible belt right here in columbia south carolina they recently just passed the law they
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:15.120]  made the law it is criminal in the city of columbia south carolina to be homeless and they are actually
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:21.360]  arresting the homeless and shipping them to encampment centers yeah i heard actually heard
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:26.480]  about that on the news a few weeks ago and then forgot to cover it guys will you print um south
[02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:32.320]  carolina city uh bands homeless and and california's done that to a certain extent in a few areas too
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:37.680]  where they basically lock you up at night uh like they would do in the poor houses in england and here's
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:42.320]  the deal they've dumped everybody out of the mental institutions there's a lot of drug addicts
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:48.080]  i feel sorry for most homeless a lot of them are street rats they're just runaways which a lot of
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:51.680]  them some of them are nice a lot of them are really nasty that's the group that you got to watch
[02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:56.800]  you know the 20 year old or so uh people out there that get really pushy and have and have killed
[02:01:56.800 --> 02:02:03.040]  people here in austin and raped you name it and they're trying to build a homeless statue to the
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:10.560]  homeless uh here in austin to kind of celebrate that and uh but at the same time banning them
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:17.040]  is a violation of the constitution on so many fronts and you are seeing more and more real
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:22.000]  homeless out there but what's really going on is working poor where families are living tend to a
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:30.800]  house uh and now june 21 is trying to ban that so uh pretty amazing what's your take on it well my
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:38.000]  take on is that they're actually shipping them out of columbia to a disclosed encampment center i mean
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:45.200]  this is stated in an article uh on the helping them post and uh amazing give us the headline because
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:50.320]  that's big if they're making them go there that's the beginning of the camps and is what the emergency
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:56.240]  centers establishment act says they would condition people because at first it'll just be uh uh poor
[02:02:56.240 --> 02:03:03.200]  people and then it'll be everybody the headline is columbia south carolina criminalizes homelessness
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:08.480]  and unanimous unanimous vote now here's the funny thing let me i want to call scum out for scum
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:16.000]  okay councilman councilman cameron runyan professes to be a christian he is the one that came up with
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:23.680]  this and they uh passed it was a unanimous unanimous vote of seven people he professes to be a christian
[02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:28.960]  and jesus christ was a homeless man when you think about it no no i hear you and as things get bad
[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:33.680]  there will be refugees of this collapse like grapes of wrath and we don't want to throw them all
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:40.720]  in fema camps uh and and sir we just found the article and the newscast uh i am just speechless
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:45.040]  right now i had heard about them banning homelessness but i thought they'd kick them out of the town
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:51.920]  which is just terrible but you're telling me that wow here it is yeah they're gonna ship them
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:58.320]  them and make them stay there but they'll be given the option to go to that
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:04.880]  or they'll be uh basically thrown out on the street somewhere else so but that's one step away
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:12.000]  from making them go yeah these people are so sick i mean state federal world level
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:17.840]  what you said earlier said something to the point of it's just us people with morals and that's it
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:23.760]  you know it's it's it's and we're all spread out we've got to come together as one and stand up
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:29.760]  against the new world over no no i mean i totally agree with you and and so many homeless people
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:35.280]  were taken as foster children put on drugs screwed up by that and they end up homeless the state
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:39.680]  on record one of the biggest producers of these vegetables that are out there on the street that's
[02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:45.600]  the biggest group of them artificially created kind of schizophrenics and it's terrible then you've
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:50.800]  got the predators out there but your average drunk or your average mentally ill person leave them alone

[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:13.360]  so uh coming up in a few minutes uh leon macadoo went out uh and we uh had her in front of the
[02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:18.880]  george washington monument asked people should we ban the name's mother and father and fine
[02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:23.600]  people or arrest people we got like an hour of this it looks like but there's a few minutes of it
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:31.040]  and it's all amazing and the majority of people that i saw in the video last night um said that
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:36.800]  that they want to arrest or find people that use the word mother or father and if you use a brown
[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:44.400]  bag that is racist as long as you say it's for obama so this is who we're dealing with ladies and
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:49.920]  gentlemen this is who we're dealing with and this is what we're facing as a society these are
[02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:56.640]  authoritarians uh haboo in wisconsin talking about syria oh if you just joined us uh israeli
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:10:02.800]  papers are reporting it's up on info wars dot com uh that report a us attack on syria to begin
[02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:07.360]  saturday now now that's a report on israel we don't know if that's true but they said before it
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:11.600]  came out in the guardian that they would be pulling out the un inspector saturday morning
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:16.240]  before the attack then that came out in the guardian syrian crisis un inspectors to leave on
[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:22.080]  saturday live updates so uh but but there's so much international heat on this so much evidence
[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:28.400]  the rebels engaged in the uh chemical attack and that it was a false flag a lot of people think
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:33.440]  that the thousands of uh alawites and others they've been kidnapping off the roads and and killing
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:37.600]  that they probably took a group to a gymnasium and then gassed them and then now they're paralyzed
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:41.440]  or dead then they roll those out for the cameras that's what it looks like because you don't respond
[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:45.440]  a minutes after and not get hurt yourself or killed and they're dragging them around and
[02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:50.240]  responding supposedly right after it looks very fake that is they nerve gas real people
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:57.360]  but it looks like this was all overseeing can you imagine this is unbelievable uh but let's go to
[02:10:57.360 --> 02:11:04.800]  habu in wisconsin go ahead well well thank you alex jones you know you have stood so tall through
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:13.360]  this this uh rush to bomb syria because you have said convincingly you believe it and you've thoroughly
[02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:20.160]  debunked uh the reasons that these punks have given for going to war but may i make two points please
[02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:28.560]  yes sir uh one is uh you know if this bombing happens then what i can see happening down the
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:34.720]  road is the thing similar to the no-fly zone established in iraq it'll be anytime there's a
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:40.960]  gas attack they'll bomb them and that will be the way they'll tie the hands of the syrian regime
[02:11:41.680 --> 02:11:48.240]  that's one point and the second point is not much has been made about the iran syria alliance which
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:56.240]  goes back to the days of the iran iraq war and i'm wondering if iran would uh risk it all by you
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:02.240]  know closing the streets of our moose if if syria is attacked what do you think and thank you so
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:06.960]  very much and may god bless you and your family well thank you god bless you and your family
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:13.680]  we're all in this together for justice and common sense and logic um no iran's basically said they're
[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:21.760]  going to shut the straight or most they're going to sink a bunch of derelict uh hulks oil tankers
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:27.600]  and stuff out there and uh the nato in the west is very good at moving that stuff but they're
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:35.200]  going to get missile attacks out of the mountainous hills above the straits once that happens and the
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:40.240]  issue is the reason nobody wants to go to war with iran is that they are concerted they fight
[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:50.880]  they're coordinated uh and they don't mind to die you got the danzig song i don't mind the pain uh
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:54.720]  the persians will you know don't mind dying i think that maybe it's like 300 where they're all
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:58.960]  devil worshipers and evil and the 300 greeks defeat them you know that's kind of put us war
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:03.920]  propaganda 300 greeks did defeat them because they held you know the small gap which is an example
[02:13:03.920 --> 02:13:09.360]  of what small numbers can do but the point is is that over a million and a half with primitive
[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:15.920]  weapons they've now got advanced weapons uh iranians held off shidam hussein i think 300
[02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:22.080]  thousand irakis they estimate died in that most of them troops that was a big deal folks uh and uh
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:30.400]  shidam did that under u.s government orders i mean he was cia trained uh he was a cia officer
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:34.960]  not an asset and that's all been declassified by the way it's just no one seems to know that
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:41.120]  that he ran the coup d'etat they put him in power in 79 he tried to run coups before that back in the
[02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:46.560]  late 50s ladies and gentlemen shidam hussein was like trained in the west the whole nine yards
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:51.680]  that's why he wanted porno movie theaters and playboy and rock and roll the radio he was secular
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:56.080]  and then they make all these movies how bad he was i mean compared to other people over there
[02:13:56.080 --> 02:14:00.800]  he represented an older policy though of trying to westernize things then they didn't want that
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:07.280]  anymore they wanted to wreck everything by the 80s they got him to attack iran that went on for seven
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:12.080]  years uh bank erupted iraq and they said you got to pay back the 40 billion now and he said wait
[02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:19.840]  am i got a deal i don't have to pay this back so he said fine so for what from like 1987 to 1990
[02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:25.360]  when the iran iraq war ended he double pumped and the saudi arabians got mad gas went down to like
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:31.520]  75 cents a gallon and it was all over the news you know oh peck angry europe you know about uh
[02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:37.840]  you know refineries angry too much oil price too low and shidam's like i've you said i got to pay
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:45.600]  these bills back so then they say we've got a way for you to do it you're right he goes my point
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:50.000]  is kawai this all came out by the way with april gillespie in the full text of the meetings there's
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:53.440]  clips of the famous thing of will you not get involved in the inner arab affairs and he looks at
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:57.120]  the camera he goes okay well i'm gonna attack them if they don't pay me back they were slant
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:04.160]  drilling into his best oil fields and he said fine i will quit over pumping if saudi arabia
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:11.280]  and kawai quit stealing my oil and he was cia commander he thought he had it all and and they
[02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:15.920]  basically told him yeah go ahead go ahead and take that we'll let you and then when he did that it
[02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:21.440]  was all over ladies and gentlemen and that's the facts and then to make iraqi to melt down worse
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:26.240]  they disbanded the iraqi military that was the only unifying force to break the country in multiple
[02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:30.880]  parts which they've effectively done but not officially to then balkanize it i mean that's
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:37.840]  how this stuff works ladies and gentlemen it's called the great game divide and conquer and it is a

[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:11.440]  channels where they show up and take your guns and it's clearly a chilling effect they're also
[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:16.880]  targeting veterans and i had joe mendez on for about 20 minutes last sunday i want to get him back on
[02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:24.000]  today to open up some phone lines and in fact these callers that are there john you can get

[02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:42.080]  veteran and they say oh well you got ptsd give us your guns because a lot of times it's done

[02:25:57.280 --> 02:26:03.360]  only ones that have the guns so he's got warrior for god 13 is his youtube website where you go
[02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:08.720]  see the stuff he talks about just kind of patriot libertarian christian stuff i get kind of american
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:14.640]  style freedom stuff that's why it's so bad he got swat teamed by the atf and a local brigade of police
[02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:20.000]  and 70 plus percent of people in the jail when he got there were people like him so they have federal
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:23.840]  grants all over the country and that's what uh bloomberg's been reporting on so i wanted to get
[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:29.440]  joe mendez on joe did you get any support or or any people contact you when you were on the show
[02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:34.160]  sunday because i know you're looking for folks to help you so that we can find out because you again
[02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:38.880]  you've just been told you've guns have been taken and that your guns are illegal even though they're
[02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:44.000]  legal semi-autos you bought back in the 80s and i've read the california laws it just you can't
[02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:51.200]  you can't buy or or sell uh new ones in the state but your guns are grandfathered so
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:56.320]  this is kind of that twilight zone thing what's happened since you were on four days ago well
[02:26:56.320 --> 02:27:02.640]  um i've had a lot of support from your viewers and i thank everybody god bless you all for the
[02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:10.720]  support that you've given me um i also emailed the rutherford institute and they're looking at the
[02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:17.280]  case they said they would get back to me in a couple of days um yeah other than that though i will
[02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:25.360]  tell you this uh it is very clear to me now that the public defender's office here which i have to
[02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:32.160]  work with until i can afford a real lawyer it has no intention of defending me um basically they're
[02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:38.800]  bumping me back and forth i'm getting conflicting reports it is now what what is it the 29th and i
[02:27:38.800 --> 02:27:46.960]  still to this day have not i have not received my complete discovery as to why there was probable
[02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:52.480]  cause to issue a warrant for my guns which i know i have the right to because the normal lawyer told
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:57.680]  me i have the right to that yet they have not provided for that the public defender will not
[02:27:57.680 --> 02:28:03.520]  push the district attorney on that and to this day since they switched me to another court
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:09.040]  i don't even know who my public defender is i call them four times and finally i got a call
[02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:15.040]  from someone who said i don't represent you um this and this and this and you're and you're
[02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:19.680]  and you were told to go to the wrong one and and what what i feel is they're trying to confuse me
[02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:24.000]  and i told them well what if i show up at the wrong one you go yeah there will be a bench
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:29.600]  warrant for arrest i said well you know you're telling me that that i'm not in this uh division
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:34.560]  where i was given the paperwork from the court to go to that they're wrong that to go to the other
[02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:39.440]  one and if i go to the other one you know and i don't show up to this one i'm gonna be arrested
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:43.760]  and put back into custody because i don't know what to tell you but i'm not your public defender
[02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:48.480]  that they'll let you know and then he goes you're in no hurry right and i said yeah i want to know
[02:28:48.480 --> 02:28:55.040]  if there has been probable cause enough and if not which i already know there hasn't and they're
[02:28:55.040 --> 02:28:59.760]  just stalling i feel the state is just stalling the railroad me well sure this is a this is a
[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:05.120]  communist and authoritarian tactic an imperial tactic that empires would use they arrest you
[02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:10.320]  or find you because you won't comply they make it impossible to comply it's like they write the
[02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:16.320]  regulations where three inch grass or objectionable material then they call three leaves on your
[02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:21.680]  property objectionable and give you fines here in austin for two thousand dollars a day and they mainly
[02:29:21.680 --> 02:29:24.960]  target old people because they know that you know they don't know what to do and they can then take
[02:29:24.960 --> 02:29:30.400]  their house this is a criminal group and absolutely they took your guns illegally now they're just
[02:29:30.400 --> 02:29:35.840]  going to pass it around it's a federal homeland security grant and they tell them look it's homeland

[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:29.280]  swarming us bum rushing us on every single front with an organized criminal plan for a
[02:34:29.280 --> 02:34:36.560]  corporate above the law world government known in their own words as a new world order a technocratic
[02:34:36.560 --> 02:34:44.320]  dictatorship and i don't like it i want to stand against it now i've i've cleaned the phones out
[02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:48.160]  and i appreciate listeners letting us do that for folks that we're already holding because
[02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:54.480]  now we have to shift gears into have you had your guns confiscated or are you the family
[02:34:54.480 --> 02:34:59.680]  member of a veteran who's had their guns confiscated wrongfully i mean obviously if somebody's saying
[02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:03.760]  i'm gonna kill myself i'm gonna kill others but all the government issued drugs they're screwed
[02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:07.440]  up they have to have their guns taken if they've been adjudicated hey this person's clearly mentally
[02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:12.640]  ill but that's not what we're talking about i mean adam lands have been adjudicated mentally ill
[02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:19.680]  he tried to buy guns illegally five times that's a sandy hook patsy even if you believe the official
[02:35:19.680 --> 02:35:24.080]  story and it's all very suspicious the anti-terror drill the guys dressed like him in the woods
[02:35:24.080 --> 02:35:28.800]  that got picked up they tried to deny it till the helicopter footage got released i mean whoa
[02:35:28.800 --> 02:35:35.040]  it doesn't look good all the timing the point is i mean if they'll fund al-qaeda to kill tens of
[02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:40.560]  thousands excuse me 200 000 christians mainly in syria what will they do oh they wouldn't do that
[02:35:40.560 --> 02:35:48.000]  here though the point is is that we're all in grave danger with this situation and they you know
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:52.480]  they talk a good game of over your safety but we know the proliferation of guns is made
[02:35:52.480 --> 02:35:59.120]  made depending on the federal statistic 49 to 61 drop in gun crime in the united states
[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:04.240]  from 1992 to 2011 that's the latest numbers we have we've beat that dead horse a thousand

[02:37:58.880 --> 02:38:02.480]  a national story with that marine now they said we're not going to let you out of here until you
[02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:06.160]  agree you're mentally ill and all that we got them the rutherford institute to help him with
[02:38:06.160 --> 02:38:11.600]  contact the rutherford institute try to help mr mendez but there's other good groups out there as
[02:38:11.600 --> 02:38:16.240]  well and usually i can load the phones up with people to tell us how they had their guns taken
[02:38:16.240 --> 02:38:26.800]  but here's the number 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 and you can also call and tell us what you
[02:38:26.800 --> 02:38:34.960]  think mr mendez should do i mean i i know legally what i would probably do uh i mean there's a lot of
[02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:42.560]  other legal proceedings you can engage in when they've wrongfully done this but it generally
[02:38:43.600 --> 02:38:48.320]  it is particular to the state itself so they probably get lawyers on myself to break all this
[02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:52.640]  down that aggressively fight against this type of thing but imagine they take your guns and they
[02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:57.680]  won't say why they came with a warrant how they knew about the guns from the 1980s that again i've
[02:38:57.680 --> 02:39:01.520]  looked at the type of guns they were those are legal in california so will everybody have their
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:06.720]  semi-autos taken in california uh joe mendez this happened to a while back ago now and they won't
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:12.080]  let him know joins us and again the toll free number to to give us your take on this is 800
[02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:18.320]  259 92 31 so so so joe you talked about the run around you're getting uh
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:25.280]  uh tell us more about the raid uh for those that just joined us how they briefly called you outside
[02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:29.200]  with the state police about a hit and run with your car you or your wife hadn't left here like
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:34.240]  that's that doesn't make sense he calls on the radio okay i've got uh joe mendez here
[02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:40.480]  and they stick m16s in your face okay for them to have guns and i believe they did this politically
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:44.800]  because of the of the political things you've said because we're seeing more of the persecution
[02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:51.280]  against people that are not communist i mean if you're a communist uh and or a hardcore racist
[02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:57.120]  you you can then buy the guns and bullets for homeland security uh as uh the atlantic wire
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:01.520]  reported last week and prepare for race war uh because they want division but if you're just
[02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:09.200]  a nice christian i guess you can't have guns oh yeah yeah um you know like i was saying last time
[02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:16.640]  my son actually got visited about two months before i did fbi and department of homeland
[02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:23.680]  security ransacked the house where he lived um the thing is that he doesn't possess firearms
[02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:29.280]  or anything but you see they were hoping that as a father you'd given him guns and that then they
[02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:34.560]  could say it was illegal because guns legally owned from the 80s were grandfathered but you had
[02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:40.000]  transferred them that's what my gut tells me knowing how the dirty tricks work yeah yeah and
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:44.560]  when they didn't find anything they you know he fought back and he told them you know you're
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:49.760]  broke my constitutional rights and what have you and this and that and they they uh he told me the
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:54.400]  fbi agent that conducted the raid called him about a week later to try to convince him
[02:40:54.400 --> 02:40:59.280]  that everything had been done legally and blah blah blah and this and that and he got a lawyer
[02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:05.440]  and uh they backed off but i told them it's all because of the videos that i make on youtube and
[02:41:05.440 --> 02:41:11.360]  the affiliation that you have with me that they started with you first um then what we noticed
[02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:17.360]  is that there was a lot of activity here at the complex from weird strange things i i they sent
[02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:23.600]  a car about a month and a half before to videotape the whole parking lot it was an unmarked car with
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:28.480]  a g marking on the plate which we know that that's a government issued car uh it drove through the
[02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:33.680]  parking lot parked in a spot for a couple seconds backed out drove back out it had four cameras
[02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:38.960]  pointing in every direction i at at which point i told the people here there's going to be a raid
[02:41:38.960 --> 02:41:44.800]  of some kind because they just mapped out all of the entrances exits and what have you why there's
[02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:49.920]  going to be a raid i don't know somebody could we get a lot of tenants that going on like i like i
[02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:56.960]  said months before there was a man cooking meth in one of the apartments here and when we called
[02:41:56.960 --> 02:42:02.400]  the police department they came out the police must have come out like 45 times and never did
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:07.200]  nothing to this guy who was cooking meth and selling out of his apartment and at one point
[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:11.440]  well they moderated you because you're cutting in on their meth deal you know i mean this guy's
[02:42:11.440 --> 02:42:16.160]  probably too small time i mean they you know the government runs most of the drugs of course
[02:42:16.160 --> 02:42:22.960]  of course and and the cop said he goes even if he had everything on the the living room table
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:27.920]  and he was fabricating it he said we couldn't do anything to him because there's no money in the
[02:42:27.920 --> 02:42:33.840]  budget to prosecute for drug offenses and and uh the day that we were going to court we were
[02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:40.960]  listening on a radio show where congress is going to go up for both to go easier on drug offenders
[02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:47.280]  and drug sellers they there's no room apparently for them they they want to get all the gun owners
[02:42:47.280 --> 02:42:52.640]  so well no no that's what happens is is that they first build the prisons and prime them
[02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:57.200]  with the nonviolent drug offenders or the violent drug offenders and then they put the patriots in
[02:42:57.200 --> 02:43:04.400]  them the in fact in rex 84 uh that's actually uh what they talked about was we'll build the
[02:43:04.400 --> 02:43:09.360]  femicamps and put illegals in them as the excuse to have them but really it's for the american people
[02:43:10.240 --> 02:43:15.280]  and michael hastings the journalist was looking into the end game which is the illegal alien
[02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:20.640]  roundup plan it's really rex 84 uh you know you know 2012 was was the last year of that official
[02:43:20.640 --> 02:43:28.240]  program but it came out that's really the cover uh for the mass roundup plan for citizens so they
[02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:34.240]  build the infrastructure for the illegals but it's really uh for political dissidents in the final
[02:43:34.240 --> 02:43:42.000]  equation go ahead sir yeah and well you know that day that day they send in a phony php car
[02:43:42.800 --> 02:43:47.600]  and uh we got it all on the surveillance cameras the guy gets off goes around our car
[02:43:47.600 --> 02:43:56.240]  looks at the vign and then walks to the office my wife is the uh manager here and uh he tells her
[02:43:56.240 --> 02:44:01.760]  your car was involved in a hit and run last night and we need we know it's not you guys
[02:44:02.320 --> 02:44:08.880]  we need a statement from everybody who uh normally rides in the car which i found very
[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:12.720]  really gave me a fake criminal report it's all part of why into the enemy that's us
[02:44:12.720 --> 02:44:19.600]  yes yes and he he told her that uh apparently a black man was reported driving our car and
[02:44:19.600 --> 02:44:25.200]  being an accident in it and what have you and i said man the car never left last night how could
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:30.240]  that be and my wife said he won't leave until you come down and give him a statement and now
[02:44:30.240 --> 02:44:36.560]  you've lost your job thanks to this i think that's going to be part of the lawsuit civil lawsuit is
[02:44:36.560 --> 02:44:42.480]  that the damages you've gone through uh under this false arrest and false imprisonment uh i mean
[02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:49.200]  it's just amazing please continue yeah so i i i proceed to get into the office and uh he shakes
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:54.560]  my hand and he says how you doing he's like i'm just going to take a statement from you it's routine
[02:44:55.440 --> 02:45:01.760]  there was some trouble with your car last night uh black man was reported to be driving your car
[02:45:01.760 --> 02:45:06.240]  but you're not a black man right so you've got nothing to worry about he says what is your name
[02:45:06.240 --> 02:45:12.320]  and i call my name's joe mendez and he i said okay and he calls into his radio and he says
[02:45:12.320 --> 02:45:19.600]  i have a joe mendez as soon as he said that the the door to the office right behind me opened up
[02:45:20.320 --> 02:45:25.600]  three agents three additional agents came in one of them immediately grabbed my hands and started
[02:45:25.600 --> 02:45:31.680]  putting handcuffs on me and i like i said two m16 machine guns came within five inches from my face
[02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:36.320]  on each side and they were yelling at me don't move you better not move listen let me ask you
[02:45:36.320 --> 02:45:39.840]  this question again folks this is how they're rolling out right now to take the guns all over
[02:45:39.840 --> 02:45:45.200]  the country and it's happening and i've seen it i see it all the time it's usually a vet will be
[02:45:45.200 --> 02:45:53.200]  cleaning guns usually an old man illinois wisconsin uh i mean texas you see it all the time and they'll
[02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:57.600]  clean a gun or put it in their trunk to go shooting the neighbor calls and the cops because the
[02:45:57.600 --> 02:46:03.360]  neighbor saw a gun that's legal go ahead and take them all and say well it's an arsenal he had five
[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:07.360]  guns and a thousand rounds of ammo well an arsenal is not illegal but that's not even an arsenal
[02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:12.560]  and then it's like well your guns are gone and there's no law and and i see this stuff like
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:16.720]  every week now and they're not getting in trouble and then i talked to you about the type of guns
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:20.880]  you had i looked it up i've had i've had the experts on about it i mean the guns you had are
[02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:27.680]  totally legal if not priceless alex they sell those guns add gun shows still here in california
[02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:32.800]  that's why i told the cop i said you guys they're selling this exact same rifle here they just put
[02:46:32.800 --> 02:46:38.000]  the bullet button on the magazine clipper or something but it's got a pistol grip it's got
[02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:41.360]  no but i've read the state law and what happened to you because i looked in this before you came
[02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:46.480]  on last sunday the point is the gun you've got you've bought before the ban is legal yes and and
[02:46:46.480 --> 02:46:52.000]  and so my point is it just shows they're targeting law abiding people with no criminal record like
[02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:59.600]  yourself now uh let's i want to go to phone calls to get people's take on all this but ladies and
[02:46:59.600 --> 02:47:04.800]  gentlemen this is happening everywhere you have to understand we've got to get aggressive
[02:47:04.800 --> 02:47:10.880]  politically congressional investigations you name it the ats got to be defunded it is such a criminal
[02:47:10.880 --> 02:47:16.720]  group uh and they they're the old revenuers that would go around killing people if they didn't
[02:47:16.720 --> 02:47:21.920]  pay them money on their moonshine that's what they come out of they've always been total criminals
[02:47:22.720 --> 02:47:27.360]  and i'm not saying every person that works at the atm is a criminal but it is the most criminal
[02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:33.360]  agency in us history it's famous they're the one recently discovered with uh dealing with the cartel
[02:47:33.360 --> 02:47:37.520]  south of the border dealing arms to the cartel south of the border well yeah but certainly sir
[02:47:37.520 --> 02:47:42.800]  came out in federal court that was in exchange for cocaine they are an importation agency
[02:47:42.800 --> 02:47:47.600]  they are they're bigger than losses at us that's why they're so criminal exactly you cannot stress
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:52.880]  what a murdering group of criminals they are they they bombed oklahoma city but they were involved
[02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:59.040]  in that that they did weiko i mean they are a murder crew uh they use them for hits as well
[02:47:59.040 --> 02:48:03.440]  and you're just lucky they didn't kill you uh but i don't know about these particular goons but
[02:48:03.440 --> 02:48:07.040]  boy i tell you they might not be criminals but they're doing things that are unconstitutional
[02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:12.560]  which is criminal uh in its own right in my view but the agency itself is a criminal history uh
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:16.720]  now i want to go to some phone calls here jeff in pennsylvania have you been the victim of
[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:21.760]  gun confiscation or what you're taking then rob has legal advice he wants to give uh or his his
[02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:27.200]  view on that go ahead jeff yes i have alex long-time listener first-time caller loved what you're
[02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:32.160]  doing about three years ago i woke up in the middle of the night so what i thought was someone
[02:48:32.160 --> 02:48:37.840]  kicking down my door uh so i grabbed romanian watson ten commonly known as the ak-47 i said
[02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:42.640]  at the top of my steps all of a sudden the window breaks something about to go on the ground and
[02:48:42.640 --> 02:48:47.840]  everything turns white and my ears are ringing turned out the police were kicking down my door
[02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:52.640]  did you help police anything like that they asked me confiscate my firearms it turns out
[02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:56.880]  i was coming home from the firing range and one of my neighbors called the Philadelphia police
[02:48:56.880 --> 02:49:01.920]  saying that they saw me with a firearm see exactly what i just said sir exactly what i just said
[02:49:01.920 --> 02:49:08.000]  and and jeff we didn't screen your call did we no sir see i this is happening everywhere
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:13.040]  and a lot of times they'll kill the vet too when they go to the house to kick down the door
[02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:17.600]  they'll grab a gun boom the guy's all high five we killed another vet i mean it's like a
[02:49:17.600 --> 02:49:23.600]  victory against us and they know how to set us up continue i hadn't dropped my firearm when they had
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:28.160]  flashbang me uh who knows what they would have done because i didn't know it was police i thought
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:31.920]  it was someone you know i was hoping you got a gun in your hand so they could get under the notch
[02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:35.840]  on their belt killing killing american gun owners is that they're the enemy they ought to be taken
[02:49:35.840 --> 02:49:40.560]  out you know yeah so it's been going on about three years now i thought a return of property in
[02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:45.600]  motions court um currently in the medicinal district courts trying to get it back but
[02:49:45.600 --> 02:49:50.960]  they've done a whole bunch of unconstitutional procedures made me sell out all types of questionnaires
[02:49:50.960 --> 02:49:56.720]  uh uh after attending to what was these uh conditions surrounding the arrest what they
[02:49:56.720 --> 02:50:00.880]  the firearms they were they were all legally owned i've yet to get them back hiring an attorney
[02:50:00.880 --> 02:50:06.400]  would be about as much as they're worth so i'm just going it you know pro say but i i couldn't
[02:50:06.400 --> 02:50:09.520]  believe that they had done that especially without saying it was police i could have been killed they
[02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:13.280]  could have been killed it just could have worked out horribly and just because someone saw me to
[02:50:13.280 --> 02:50:18.960]  went back from the firing range yeah well that's the normal thing is that uh even rural areas i saw
[02:50:18.960 --> 02:50:23.520]  an article a few years ago where in the edge of the countryside you know the city had grown in the
[02:50:23.520 --> 02:50:28.880]  area but uh the old farmer came back and was butchering a deer deer season it was legal and
[02:50:28.880 --> 02:50:35.200]  lawful he had his tags and the police came and said well your neighbors saw it that's abuse of
[02:50:35.200 --> 02:50:41.520]  them to see a dead deer and arrested him because i mean they they i'm telling you folks they hate
[02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:47.040]  good people not all of them but more and more so did you ever get your guns back uh it's been
[02:50:47.040 --> 02:50:50.960]  about three years now i have a hearing on the 30th finally with the judge i had to jump through a

[02:54:16.640 --> 02:54:22.560]  i want to explain to everybody out there in fact cj get on the microphone briefly everyone i know
[02:54:24.560 --> 02:54:28.320]  who's smart living in the city if you're gonna go to the shooting range or go deer hunting or duck
[02:54:28.320 --> 02:54:33.280]  hunting you put your guns in a case your neighbors can't tell and you sneak out at night now that's
[02:54:33.280 --> 02:54:40.000]  why i love the open carry people is there can they are countering the anti-gun people will look my guns
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:45.200]  legal and the media hates that because then it shows these guns aren't illegal but let me tell you
[02:54:45.200 --> 02:54:50.240]  they kill a lot of people because your neighbor sees you put the deer rifle in your car and the cops
[02:54:50.240 --> 02:54:55.360]  will pull you over you put one in your in your gun rack and harass you and this is part of their
[02:54:55.360 --> 02:55:01.520]  persecution against us outside of law and it's time to get aggressive but uh cj tell folks what
[02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:05.040]  you were telling me during the break i was just commenting on the fact that before i can go to
[02:55:05.040 --> 02:55:11.200]  the range set in a rifle uh practice every good marksman needs to practice frequently so they
[02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:15.760]  can keep their aim on i have to do it at night uh my progressive neighbors it's not that i've been
[02:55:15.760 --> 02:55:20.720]  had the police call to me but uh i'm not afraid of facing the police if i have to it's just
[02:55:21.440 --> 02:55:26.240]  my my neighbors don't understand that and they uh well take chris i mean he's had friends since
[02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:30.400]  college and they found out he works here and they said i am evil and then basically the devil
[02:55:30.400 --> 02:55:35.520]  i mean it's just like we are the bad people we have to get used to that right we are the enemy
[02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:41.040]  we are the terrorist george washington is bad and they actually believe it i'm telling you if you've
[02:55:41.040 --> 02:55:45.280]  got if you've got commie neighbors they call themselves progressives if your kid has their
[02:55:45.280 --> 02:55:51.040]  hair sticking up they'll call the cps on you i mean these people are just the filth of the planet
[02:55:51.600 --> 02:55:56.080]  anything else evil american i did have a friend who was a foreign exchange student from australia
[02:55:56.080 --> 02:56:01.760]  that freaked out the first time he saw a gun rack and in a pickup with a rifle in it in texas i know
[02:56:01.760 --> 02:56:06.560]  i know i know it's it's just incredible we haven't gotten to macadoo's report i'm going to overdrive

[02:56:31.040 --> 02:56:36.880]  to speak to a lorden's king uh a judge to get your guns that they took because the neighbor
[02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:41.600]  saw one and got scared yes sir that's correct originally when i was arrested the scout out
[02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:47.600]  here police did not know that was legal to own a semi-automatic ak-47 so i stayed in the local
[02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:52.960]  jail for about three weeks i was visited by the ats about four different times all right so first
[02:56:52.960 --> 02:56:59.760]  i had to go through the ats hurdles after i jumped over them i went with the local lda her hurdles
[02:56:59.760 --> 02:57:05.200]  they originally set my bow to 150 000 10 percent of which would have been 15 000 it took me about
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:09.120]  three and a half weeks to finally get that lowered to 15 000 where i could post 10 percent of that at
[02:57:09.120 --> 02:57:14.480]  1500 and after all this about three years later september 30th i finally have a hearing now
[02:57:14.480 --> 02:57:19.840]  where i can present my case i have case law as an extensive research and hopefully i'm praying
[02:57:19.840 --> 02:57:25.760]  but philadelphia's berries are all in it together to judge the da well listen i know personally people
[02:57:25.760 --> 02:57:30.240]  that have had their children taken for not vaccinating and there is no law get for some
[02:57:30.240 --> 02:57:36.160]  the lawless we're in an authoritarian country unbelievable god bless you jeff uh joe mendez

[02:57:44.960 --> 02:57:51.360]  of your videos you're just talking about what we talk about not even as hardcore uh but they don't
[02:57:51.360 --> 02:57:57.280]  like it i mean these are really evil people yes they are yes they are and i have a take
[02:57:57.280 --> 02:58:03.440]  on why i think that they're doing gun sweeps here in california we saw a report a couple of days
[02:58:03.440 --> 02:58:10.480]  ago there's a big fire going on angiocity now the governor here has called a state of emergency
[02:58:10.480 --> 02:58:17.040]  over that fire and says that they are gonna cut san francisco's water supply by two-thirds
[02:58:17.040 --> 02:58:21.440]  and that there is a state of emergency that there's a state of emergency inexistent for
[02:58:21.440 --> 02:58:28.480]  san francisco and uh you know you need a state of emergency before you can call marshal law
[02:58:28.480 --> 02:58:34.800]  and that coupled with the fact that i received the report that un peacekeeper troops here russian

[03:00:41.200 --> 03:00:48.720]  for a duck hunting shotgun in texas in dallas in houston i see the articles i was mentioning this
[03:00:50.320 --> 03:00:57.360]  that a neighbor usually sees a gun or they'll be like a hamburger place even next door to one case
[03:00:57.360 --> 03:01:02.080]  i saw it to a gun range and people see guns coming out and they call the cops there in the cops come
[03:01:02.080 --> 03:01:08.320]  and take them and in a few areas in texas or arizona didn't like this in a few other states but
[03:01:08.320 --> 03:01:13.440]  it even happens in texas now they have billboards up everywhere saying report illegal guns that show
[03:01:13.440 --> 03:01:18.880]  an image of a revolver and i had a carpet cleaner start to call the cops on me i've told the story
[03:01:18.880 --> 03:01:23.440]  a hundred times i won't tell it again i don't like 16 years ago and until i call the supervisors they
[03:01:23.440 --> 03:01:27.440]  said yes we know he's trying to call he told us to call we understand sir but well but he doesn't
[03:01:27.440 --> 03:01:32.320]  feel comfortable doing your carpet because i had like a shotgun on a rack before i had kids in my
[03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:39.040]  studio and i mean these are gilded people folks they flip out if they see a slave with a weapon
[03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:48.880]  i mean they are really conditioned and um it's disgusting and we've got of course our guest on
[03:01:48.880 --> 03:01:54.880]  the broadcast with us here today who's been going through all this joe mendez and joe before you
[03:01:54.880 --> 03:01:59.200]  leave us in the next segment i'm going to give out the link so people can go donate to help you
[03:01:59.200 --> 03:02:03.520]  but really what you need is knowledge and and it's it's not just you know we can try to help you
[03:02:03.520 --> 03:02:09.120]  but the what's really going to save us is the general knowledge that this persecution is going on
[03:02:11.120 --> 03:02:16.880]  that that this is happening and that there's a silent secret quiet war against gun owners
[03:02:16.880 --> 03:02:22.400]  that's illegal and criminal that we've got to organize against the fiat attack outside of law
[03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:27.040]  on our rights robin arkansas has some legal advice he wants to give you go ahead rob thanks
[03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:33.760]  for holding hi alex long time first time a lot of people are unaware that the prohibition there's
[03:02:33.760 --> 03:02:40.560]  prohibition on the confiscation of firearms that is in law according to the us code and it's everyone
[03:02:40.560 --> 03:02:44.880]  that is a firearm owner should probably look this up and print this out and keep this with their
[03:02:44.880 --> 03:02:52.240]  firearms they want to do a search on prohibition on confiscation of firearms the section in the
[03:02:52.240 --> 03:03:04.000]  us code is us code title 42 section 5207 and a little history uh after hurricane katrina
[03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:08.800]  and all that gun confiscation went on down in louisiana there was such an outrage that
[03:03:09.440 --> 03:03:16.000]  david vitter who is a senator from louisiana proposed what came to be known as the david
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:22.240]  or the vitter amendment or the personal or the disaster recovery personal protection act that's
[03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:26.720]  right judges got involved in the atf and all of them got in trouble that's right i'd forgotten
[03:03:26.720 --> 03:03:31.440]  about that yeah the vet erect and then there's also i remember i mean it's obviously illegal to
[03:03:31.440 --> 03:03:35.920]  take somebody's property period that isn't illegal uh but they try to act like they didn't know and
[03:03:35.920 --> 03:03:42.720]  then the atf does a ruling but go ahead right the thing is that this was overwhelmingly approved by
[03:03:42.720 --> 03:03:52.320]  senate by vote of 86 to 14 and this was actually signed into law by president bush in 2006 that's
[03:03:52.320 --> 03:03:56.640]  right the vet erect i had totally forgotten guys pull up the vet erect i mean it's just so much
[03:03:56.640 --> 03:04:01.520]  knowledge with our listeners man rob we ought to we ought to have you on as a guest or get
[03:04:01.520 --> 03:04:07.200]  larry pratt on the nightly news or on the show tomorrow about this secret persecution uh go ahead
[03:04:07.200 --> 03:04:15.440]  caller what i was going to say is uh that my question to you is considering the fact that
[03:04:15.440 --> 03:04:20.400]  president bush was just a frontman for the globalists and considering the fact that most of our
[03:04:20.400 --> 03:04:26.640]  congressmen are bought and paid for by globalists why do you think that since this would be in direct
[03:04:26.640 --> 03:04:32.880]  opposition of what the globalists want why would president bush sign a prohibition on the confiscation
[03:04:32.880 --> 03:04:38.400]  of firearms why would the senate overwhelmingly approve that you know what this is an important
[03:04:38.400 --> 03:04:43.920]  point come back restate about the vet amendment and then i'll try to give you uh my answer on that
[03:04:43.920 --> 03:04:52.480]  but the short answer is because the will of the people were behind it and oh and and bush had to
[03:04:52.480 --> 03:04:57.520]  at least pay lip service to it and by signing it you know he was for the assault weapons ban
[03:04:57.520 --> 03:05:04.480]  but but he wasn't for the assault weapons ban you know introducing pro one all of your filtration

[03:08:14.480 --> 03:08:29.760]  alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[03:08:29.760 --> 03:08:36.400]  ladies and gentlemen i have read the civil asset forfeiture a federal law and the federal court
[03:08:36.400 --> 03:08:41.600]  rulings i've had lawyers on about it it does not say police can pull you over and take your car
[03:08:41.600 --> 03:08:47.760]  if no drugs are found they just expand it out to say that and and here is an article on a natural
[03:08:47.760 --> 03:08:53.920]  news today natural news dot com we have it up on info wars dot com cops nationwide stealing
[03:08:53.920 --> 03:09:00.400]  cash jewelry valuables from innocent citizens under civil forfeiture laws and here is on the same
[03:09:00.400 --> 03:09:09.280]  topic a new yorker magazine this month of the august issue in police states or in most states
[03:09:09.280 --> 03:09:15.280]  police have the right to confiscate possessions like your cash car home even if you aren't charged
[03:09:15.280 --> 03:09:21.040]  with a crime that is the law but should it be see and and they're so ignorant they it's wrong
[03:09:21.040 --> 03:09:24.880]  they think it's the law no it's not the law and all their regulations are trumped by common law
[03:09:24.880 --> 03:09:32.880]  bill of rights constitution and our will to say no texas is famous not just with local jurisdictions
[03:09:32.880 --> 03:09:37.680]  the state police if an old lady opens up a wall to give them a license they'll grab five thousand
[03:09:37.680 --> 03:09:42.640]  even five hundred they'll just take it and say hey it's up to you to prove it didn't drug money
[03:09:42.640 --> 03:09:47.520]  then they'll have a lab test all the bills and find drugs on it all old money has drugs on it
[03:09:48.320 --> 03:09:52.240]  you know because it's stored in banks that ship the drugs and all the rest of it the drug dealers
[03:09:52.240 --> 03:09:59.920]  they all know that and the reason i raised this while we're taking calls is uh i had forgotten
[03:10:00.720 --> 03:10:07.520]  that the senate passed the vetter amendment 84 to 16 and that bush then signed it and this
[03:10:07.520 --> 03:10:12.320]  is a larry pratt statement they obviously got our message loud and clear it was the most lopsided
[03:10:12.320 --> 03:10:17.360]  gun vote i've ever seen as told by a senate official the goa after the overwhelming vote
[03:10:17.360 --> 03:10:23.440]  yesterday so that's a quote from the senate staffer to larry pratt and and yes they needed this
[03:10:23.440 --> 03:10:28.400]  because all over the country people have legal guns and the ats of the neighbor saw it and goes
[03:10:28.400 --> 03:10:33.680]  that man has a gun because of the federal billboard saying report guns showing a revolver a shotgun
[03:10:33.680 --> 03:10:40.400]  and knowing they would get false reports they then take the guns this is just like all over
[03:10:40.400 --> 03:10:44.720]  the news they will take people's children if they don't take vaccines now if you go in and
[03:10:44.720 --> 03:10:50.560]  you're upper middle class you fill out a birth plan say no to vaccines act like you know what
[03:10:50.560 --> 03:10:54.400]  you're talking about the criminals even though they don't know their criminals it's a it's a
[03:10:54.400 --> 03:11:00.960]  criminal training will case you and go this one knows their rights but if you go in and they'll
[03:11:00.960 --> 03:11:04.800]  come in and say you didn't give shots the cps here to see if you know how to feed your baby right
[03:11:04.800 --> 03:11:09.040]  and of course babies always can't nurse perfectly at first they go let's see if the baby does it
[03:11:09.040 --> 03:11:15.280]  right away oops the baby refused twice your kids ours and then tell you they took them because
[03:11:18.640 --> 03:11:22.400]  you aren't giving vaccines but really they just go to the court and they say we won't take your
[03:11:22.400 --> 03:11:27.440]  kid just sign this plan to admit that you have done bad and that you'll do better which is really
[03:11:27.440 --> 03:11:32.160]  revoking your rights to them and then they literally like in a little mermaid when the witch gets the
[03:11:32.160 --> 03:11:41.600]  document they go you'll never see that kid again i mean just the most satanic murdering scum excuse
[03:11:41.600 --> 03:11:47.600]  me i don't mean to start getting like that i'm just so sick of them abusing absolutely everybody
[03:11:47.600 --> 03:11:53.920]  across the board in pelmel evil and and and and then they have this caller call in see i've been
[03:11:53.920 --> 03:11:58.320]  there folks when i got called by families i was helping little sweet families you open the door
[03:11:58.320 --> 03:12:03.840]  and the cops choking the woman saying sign it and and and then i have flashbacks that i knew i
[03:12:03.840 --> 03:12:07.760]  didn't up in prison and couldn't fight him and and might came in with the camera behind when we caught
[03:12:07.760 --> 03:12:11.520]  some of it people a lot of you in awesome seen that tv report we ought to dig it up put it on the web
[03:12:12.160 --> 03:12:18.240]  and i just broke down and cried for hours because i realized i'm a slave i'm a piece of filth i'm
[03:12:18.240 --> 03:12:21.840]  dominated by criminals and they're going to take kids and they're going to do whatever they want to
[03:12:21.840 --> 03:12:25.840]  do and i'm gonna let them do it because they got batches and guns and they're god and that's the end
[03:12:25.840 --> 03:12:32.960]  of it excuse me they're gonna take our guns our children our land our money our freedom our future
[03:12:32.960 --> 03:12:39.360]  our health and we're gonna let them do it because that's what we are excuse me i try not to blow up
[03:12:39.360 --> 03:12:44.160]  and i shouldn't blow up and it just and this is not an act when i get angry folks because the crimes
[03:12:44.160 --> 03:12:48.560]  being committed against us are so horrible i apologize to the guests and the callers we're
[03:12:48.560 --> 03:12:53.840]  going to get to you i got to settle down sometimes uh joe mendez had his guns taken
[03:12:53.840 --> 03:12:57.360]  it could happen to all of us i take it personal what happened to him because you know what's
[03:12:57.360 --> 03:13:02.560]  happened to everybody else and the people they kill in these fake raids they just love killing
[03:13:02.560 --> 03:13:07.040]  people they're cowards that get to rule us because we're worse than they are and i just
[03:13:07.040 --> 03:13:12.960]  am just i just can't believe it um i'm gonna shut up now let's go to robin arkansas called in with
[03:13:12.960 --> 03:13:18.480]  great legal advice no reminding us that they had to pass another law saying you can't take guns
[03:13:18.480 --> 03:13:23.920]  illegally but they don't care because they work for foreign banks uh i'm sorry i'm ranting sir
[03:13:23.920 --> 03:13:28.160]  repeat about the vetter amendment and we're gonna repost this it's important to know with
[03:13:28.160 --> 03:13:35.120]  them mr mendez's case and what you would do if you were he well of course he's already had his
[03:13:35.120 --> 03:13:42.160]  guns confiscated but i believe that you know the us code is pretty clear that they were confiscated
[03:13:42.160 --> 03:13:50.000]  illegally and in violation of the us code title 42 chapter 68 sub chapter v section 5207
[03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:55.280]  so that was clearly violated but uh what i plan to do for the future i've got this printed out
[03:13:55.280 --> 03:14:01.760]  i keep it with my firearms and in the event that they ever do a try and do a gun confiscation
[03:14:01.760 --> 03:14:07.200]  i'm planning on just uh nicely addressing the officers or the soldiers or whatever and
[03:14:07.200 --> 03:14:12.960]  well i understand you're here to uphold and enforce the law and they'll probably say
[03:14:12.960 --> 03:14:17.600]  right i am and then i will hand them this section from the us code and say well this
[03:14:17.600 --> 03:14:23.920]  is what the law says please go out and leave me alone and enforce the law and even if they
[03:14:23.920 --> 03:14:29.520]  still fill your guns because the feds said so because the president's god down the road it'll
[03:14:29.520 --> 03:14:36.320]  be clear in the entire report that you gave them this exactly and i did send this information
[03:14:36.320 --> 03:14:43.120]  to show tips at info wars dot com but seriously if you own a firearm you need to look this up do a
[03:14:43.120 --> 03:14:48.960]  search on prohibition on confiscation of firearms oh yeah print this out and keep it with your guns
[03:14:48.960 --> 03:14:53.600]  and uh take a look at this Alex you really need to read this it's it's really important no no no
[03:14:53.600 --> 03:14:58.640]  i remember it it's like all the time now i've got so much going on that like things i knew about i'm
[03:14:58.640 --> 03:15:05.440]  like oh yeah it's like you totally forget plus i knew it was already in law that that they can't
[03:15:05.440 --> 03:15:09.920]  do this in the code but they passed more laws being very specific because they're aware of
[03:15:09.920 --> 03:15:16.240]  what the atf is doing or they just announced well there's a wildfire nearby we're taking all the
[03:15:16.240 --> 03:15:21.600]  guns mr mendez the victim we have here showcasing i appreciate your call rob we're gonna go to more
[03:15:21.600 --> 03:15:25.920]  calls here in a moment but what do you think about that gentleman just said well i was gonna say the
[03:15:25.920 --> 03:15:32.080]  problem with that was that it's a good thing and everything but i didn't get a chance to present
[03:15:32.080 --> 03:15:37.680]  anything they just machine gunned my face handcuffed me and they wouldn't even to this day they won't
[03:15:37.680 --> 03:15:44.240]  tell me why i actually was arrested and they took me for interrogation and and they wouldn't so i wouldn't
[03:15:44.240 --> 03:15:49.040]  even have had a chance to give them that document because i really feel like you said i like they
[03:15:49.040 --> 03:15:54.320]  wanted to kill me the guys with the machine guns were shaking and their shoes itching to pull that
[03:15:54.320 --> 03:15:58.960]  trigger they wanted to kill me well they do that kill a lot of people though they like it i'm telling
[03:15:58.960 --> 03:16:03.680]  you i'm talking to some of these gun confiscation crews they will sit around bragging about yeah
[03:16:03.680 --> 03:16:10.240]  that old vet he i came in his garage he had a gun i shot him eight times he was crap splattered all
[03:16:10.240 --> 03:16:14.400]  i was talking to one cop about how they bragged how the old man's crap was blown out of him
[03:16:14.400 --> 03:16:18.400]  up against the wall and the cops liked that the old man hitting his knees and falling down and
[03:16:18.400 --> 03:16:25.760]  people don't believe me they can watch inside the la pd 1998 i played this on the show they go to a
[03:16:25.760 --> 03:16:31.600]  dead vets house who had a heart attack make fun of his dead body say he's in r.a scum and say i'm
[03:16:31.600 --> 03:16:39.120]  keeping these guns for myself i mean i'm telling you folks we are in trouble unbelievable another
[03:16:39.120 --> 03:16:45.920]  thing that i tried to talk to them about my guns are are free ban it was and what the agent told me
[03:16:45.920 --> 03:16:52.800]  is it doesn't matter california has its own constitution on gun yeah and see i knew that so
[03:16:52.800 --> 03:16:57.840]  i checked state laws and it's not true either and i know they just look look they want to ban
[03:16:57.840 --> 03:17:02.720]  semi auto 22s i mean these because they're criminals i mean we're in deep trouble jeffin
[03:17:02.720 --> 03:17:07.520]  illinois what's your legal advice that we've got more gun confiscation stories go ahead now they're
[03:17:07.520 --> 03:17:14.320]  pouring in hello yes sir go ahead uh yeah um well just first put it up there i'm not a lawyer
[03:17:14.320 --> 03:17:18.080]  or anything but i've had dealt with the court systems a lot throughout my life and whatnot
[03:17:18.080 --> 03:17:23.840]  and more or less i was just telling them estimate is no i'm first off keep your head up don't give
[03:17:23.840 --> 03:17:29.440]  up don't quit the fight at all because so far i've always learned the courts will do anything in
[03:17:29.440 --> 03:17:35.600]  there than they possibly can to drag out a case to make it as long as possible threaten you everything
[03:17:36.320 --> 03:17:40.000]  just in hopes that you actually give up and just go with what they want you to
[03:17:40.720 --> 03:17:43.840]  so pretty much like the best thing you can do especially when you're dealing with a public
[03:17:43.840 --> 03:17:49.520]  pretender i refuse to call them defenders because they're pretenders learn as much as learn as much
[03:17:49.520 --> 03:17:53.680]  as you can about the law that's why i like your last caller who actually had uh the codes for it
[03:17:54.480 --> 03:17:59.440]  look up as much as you possibly can and make your public pretender work for you one thing i've
[03:17:59.440 --> 03:18:06.480]  come to learn all the cases i've ever dealt with is always unless you actually can bring it to your
[03:18:06.480 --> 03:18:11.920]  uh public pretender and show them the law you know they suppose they went to law school they won't
[03:18:11.920 --> 03:18:16.240]  bring up these issues they won't bring they won't really protect well they all know they all know
[03:18:16.240 --> 03:18:19.360]  they're paid to make sure you get convicted most of them there are a few good ones but they get
[03:18:19.360 --> 03:18:25.280]  run out that's on record you have to show them in law that they are not giving you a real defense
[03:18:25.280 --> 03:18:30.000]  and that you know just like you go in with a pre-plan on your kids you know i'm not taking
[03:18:30.000 --> 03:18:34.720]  vaccines uh you know they know your rights they're like yes sir and then the nurses go we don't give
[03:18:34.720 --> 03:18:39.440]  them to our kids either actually have them do that to me but you go in there and act like you're scared
[03:18:39.440 --> 03:18:45.840]  but don't take the shots they will take your baby i mean these are body snatch and trap i mean
[03:18:45.840 --> 03:18:52.560]  they're the enemy but government is a legion of filth i mean it's just unbelievable i don't know
[03:18:52.560 --> 03:18:59.680]  how else to put it they are filled you know and uh just one other point i want to touch on too
[03:18:59.680 --> 03:19:04.480]  without gun confiscation aspect personally i haven't had to deal with it even though i have
[03:19:04.480 --> 03:19:09.680]  had the hdf at my house just so happily i wasn't there when they came but uh that's another big
[03:19:09.680 --> 03:19:14.800]  thing don't have all your guns on your premises have them hidden don't talk to them and don't
[03:19:14.800 --> 03:19:17.680]  answer the door a lot of times they don't even have a warrant they will get you to open the door
[03:19:17.680 --> 03:19:23.200]  and then shove their criminal way in um one thing i thought too just wanted to say is like uh here
[03:19:23.200 --> 03:19:27.360]  in alamoy in chicago uh which is actually our came across an article where in which they're
[03:19:27.360 --> 03:19:34.800]  actually confiscating uh void card owners of guns because because of the fact of their
[03:19:35.520 --> 03:19:41.200]  their void card was expired yeah i know the the day after it expires and hadn't even come in the
[03:19:41.200 --> 03:19:45.760]  mail yet because they did you they will swat team and their favorites old people oh yeah that's
[03:19:45.760 --> 03:19:51.440]  incredible they have special state police unit of guys that dress up in soldier outfits and then go
[03:19:51.440 --> 03:19:57.600]  battle the american people oh yes thank you jeff robin michigan tell us your gun confiscation story
[03:19:58.720 --> 03:20:05.200]  yeah i i uh i'll be real quick i uh caught my ex cheating then i told her to get out
[03:20:05.200 --> 03:20:10.000]  to change the locks in the house went to work out of state when i was working out of state
[03:20:10.640 --> 03:20:16.960]  she uh told the cops i beat her when they got back to state they arrested me on my work i had
[03:20:16.960 --> 03:20:22.720]  go to do trials you know jury trials everything i was told not guilty but while this was going on
[03:20:22.720 --> 03:20:28.880]  they kicked in my door took all my guns took me three years to get my guns back even though
[03:20:28.880 --> 03:20:34.160]  it's not guilty three years yeah that's why you got to watch who your girlfriend is or who your
[03:20:34.160 --> 03:20:39.840]  wife is uh that's what it matter how good looking a woman is or whatever or how nice she seems on
[03:20:39.840 --> 03:20:45.200]  the surface and if she they'll let you know like you know they they got a mean streak and make stuff
[03:20:45.200 --> 03:20:50.160]  up and let me tell you the minute you got to drop them like that just boom immediately bad women
[03:20:50.160 --> 03:20:54.960]  need to be thrown directly to the curb same thing with bad women uh bad men for women out there
[03:20:55.920 --> 03:21:01.680]  and and that's their plan to like to draw it out and bleed you for your money again this
[03:21:01.680 --> 03:21:08.960]  cost me 70 grand just to clear my good name and then uh no that's a standard deal they teach women
[03:21:08.960 --> 03:21:14.080]  now is file a fake report i mean we see it in the news all the time it's like the lacrosse team that
[03:21:14.080 --> 03:21:21.680]  was just all made up and it's really bad it's really dangerous very dangerous yeah so that i had i had
[03:21:21.680 --> 03:21:26.560]  multiple girlfriends who would get mad if i told them i was leaving or breaking up with them who
[03:21:26.560 --> 03:21:31.520]  would punch me scratch me hit me and then grab the phone and go i'm gonna call the police if you leave
[03:21:32.080 --> 03:21:37.520]  and i'd be like call them then and leave but i mean uh is that like common i hear that's common
[03:21:37.520 --> 03:21:44.160]  what i mean it's like man man honey that's we're done sorry go ahead yeah and this isn't this
[03:21:44.160 --> 03:21:48.400]  doesn't just happen to me because i travel when i work i've been a road a long time and i don't
[03:21:48.400 --> 03:21:53.280]  know i know so many men now where the divorce starts and they just get a restraining order
[03:21:53.280 --> 03:21:58.080]  and take your guns without even saying you did anything to them yeah and then that is people
[03:21:58.080 --> 03:22:03.040]  don't have the money to fight back so again i didn't clear my name but they figure you won't
[03:22:03.040 --> 03:22:07.600]  spend 70 grand to get $10,000 worth of guns absolutely hold on a minute let's bring up Joe Mendes
[03:22:07.600 --> 03:22:13.200]  i can hear he was saying something go ahead sir yeah that that is so so true uh a lot of the things
[03:22:13.200 --> 03:22:20.160]  that i'm hearing right now about about i have uh i'm married now i have an ex and uh you know she
[03:22:20.160 --> 03:22:25.440]  called the SWAT team on me he has guns and all about and where just because she said so they
[03:22:25.440 --> 03:22:30.320]  came to my house and put their machine guns in my face this happened like five years ago and and
[03:22:30.320 --> 03:22:35.760]  you know yeah they just say they just say he has guns and i feel threatened and some of the women
[03:22:35.760 --> 03:22:40.320]  won't even lie well has he threatened you know doesn't matter your guns are gone now is that a
[03:22:40.320 --> 03:22:51.280]  free country the 68 gun control act says felons or people that make threats go ahead yeah and and
[03:22:51.280 --> 03:22:55.680]  you know they nothing came about that but i told the cop i said so if she would have said i was
[03:22:55.680 --> 03:23:01.200]  Charles Manson and had 30 bodies you're gonna come still just because someone said so i mean you
[03:23:01.200 --> 03:23:05.600]  have to have problems they didn't have a warrant that day and they busted into my house and everything
[03:23:05.600 --> 03:23:11.440]  i've been being harassed forever just for being a gun owner and and you have to well let me say
[03:23:11.440 --> 03:23:16.400]  this mr mendez and we've got affiliates in california it's a beautiful state from about you know
[03:23:18.080 --> 03:23:23.440]  the middle of the state up uh you're very beautiful nice people but at the same time
[03:23:23.440 --> 03:23:28.240]  really a spirit of evil there especially in in LA why don't you get out of california
[03:23:28.240 --> 03:23:33.360]  you know there's a mass exodus hollywood's leaving everybody's leaving or at least they're running to
[03:23:33.360 --> 03:23:40.800]  the north uh the north is bad too alec but as soon as i'm done with this if i can get any money out
[03:23:40.800 --> 03:23:45.920]  of a lawsuit trust me i'm going to a gun toting state where guns are legal like arizona texas

[03:24:12.560 --> 03:24:19.520]  when it comes to guns the point is they're here saying we've now literally crapped all over california

[03:27:05.440 --> 03:27:10.080]  because they saw the old man with a gun and they're cleaning it in the garage while martha's inside
[03:27:10.080 --> 03:27:17.120]  making dinner a casserole i mean it but a lot of times the cops think it's funny and and i mean it's
