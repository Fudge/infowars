[00:00:30.515 --> 00:00:40.444]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:00:40.444 --> 00:00:41.745]  Big Brother.
[00:00:41.745 --> 00:00:43.526]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:43.526 --> 00:00:45.288]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:45.288 --> 00:00:46.849]  You want answers?
[00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:48.430]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.614]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:52.614 --> 00:00:56.718]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:12.118]  Two of my crew are arriving as we speak north of Austin, Texas in Taylor, where a demonstration was scheduled to be kicked off today.
[00:01:12.118 --> 00:01:14.299]  I should have plugged it yesterday.
[00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.581]  I wasn't aware of it.
[00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:19.703]  At a FEMA camp that holds entire families.
[00:01:20.603 --> 00:01:28.028]  Remember early last year in 2006, the Houston Chronicle reported they would keep illegal aliens and U.S.
[00:01:28.028 --> 00:01:31.811]  citizens at new FEMA camps built around the country.
[00:01:31.811 --> 00:01:35.994]  Well, they've got one up in Taylor where they split up the men, women, and children.
[00:01:37.572 --> 00:01:42.976]  Of course, these are other than Mexicans that are held at these facilities.
[00:01:42.976 --> 00:01:50.603]  Al Chertoff runs around and arrests a few thousand here, a few thousand there of Mexican workers, while there's 30 million inside the country.
[00:01:50.603 --> 00:02:04.814]  It's all smoke and mirrors to set the precedent to arrest people without due process and to set the precedent to basically sell the public on immigration control that is non-existent, but to create that illusion
[00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:14.725]  So, coming up in about 30 minutes, we'll get a report from on the ground via one of their cell phones up there at the facility.
[00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:23.370]  We'll tell you more about that in the meantime.
[00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.873]  In the meantime, here are some of the other news we have today.
[00:02:27.873 --> 00:02:31.355]  Social Security agreement with Mexico
[00:02:33.616 --> 00:03:01.746]  released after three and a half year freedom of information act battle and that dovetails with the report we've been covering since friday out of the boston globe how they're going to expand the number of illegal aliens that are instantly legalized in our armed forces our foreign mercenary army that journey is almost almost complete we're talking about making fifty percent
[00:03:02.652 --> 00:03:31.833]  of infantry forces uh... being illegal alien and they're also hiring them that are convicted aggravated felons you can't make this type stuff up i mean who would imagine that the land of the free home of the brave but really it's the land of the dumbed down home of the surveilled and so when we get back from break i want to talk about two different two different rails that uh... really coincide
[00:03:33.414 --> 00:03:40.076]  And that is that 2007 is the year of the North American Union.
[00:03:40.076 --> 00:03:47.379]  This is the year when it's really going to be in full operation.
[00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:55.481]  You could herald last year as the real birth of it, but it's now walking and talking.
[00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:58.102]  It's like a two-year-old.
[00:03:59.796 --> 00:04:03.858]  It was born in March of 2005.
[00:04:03.858 --> 00:04:06.700]  It began to crawl in January of last year.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.182]  It began to toddle in the middle of last year.
[00:04:10.182 --> 00:04:15.745]  And now it's two years of age, speaking in full sentences.
[00:04:15.745 --> 00:04:18.807]  It has extremely sharp teeth, by the way.
[00:04:18.807 --> 00:04:20.468]  It's not a friendly creature.
[00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:34.217]  So, we will discuss that, 2007, the year of the American Union, and 2006, conversely, is the year America, the United States, died.
[00:04:34.217 --> 00:04:43.621]  So I thought I would go over that in the next segment, and go over some of the voluminous evidence along those lines.
[00:04:45.988 --> 00:04:49.770]  Then I will plunge into, of course, the FEMA camp.
[00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.172]  One of two in Texas, as reported by the Austin American Statesman a week ago.
[00:04:56.172 --> 00:04:59.293]  And the alternative press has been out there videotaping and taking photos of it.
[00:04:59.293 --> 00:05:09.577]  In the old days, when I was less conditioned, I would have been up there instantly, but I've been to so many FEMA camps and covered so many of them, I'm just kind of like, yeah, FEMA camp.
[00:05:09.577 --> 00:05:10.698]  FEMA camp.
[00:05:10.698 --> 00:05:12.438]  Been there, done that.
[00:05:12.438 --> 00:05:14.459]  But it is important because children are in it.
[00:05:17.037 --> 00:05:20.180]  You know, it's like when the Washington Post says we'll all be forced to take microchips soon.
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.104]  I kind of go, eh, you know.
[00:05:24.104 --> 00:05:26.507]  Bush is to announce the new Iraq strategy.
[00:05:26.507 --> 00:05:28.248]  We'll tell you about that, too.
[00:05:28.248 --> 00:05:30.931]  It's a big January 2nd edition, 2007.
[00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:31.352]  InfoWars.gov.
[00:05:39.247 --> 00:05:42.751]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:42.751 --> 00:05:45.054]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:45.054 --> 00:05:52.702]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:53.402 --> 00:06:00.845]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:00.845 --> 00:06:12.569]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:16.550]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.811]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:22.652]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:51.574 --> 00:06:54.896]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.

[00:06:58.658 --> 00:07:08.260]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.000]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.362]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[00:07:35.462 --> 00:07:37.742]  Attention, attention everyone!
[00:07:37.742 --> 00:07:40.223]  A brand new invention just released.
[00:07:40.223 --> 00:07:45.324]  It's called Wrist Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[00:07:45.324 --> 00:07:52.325]  Wrist Ease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[00:07:52.325 --> 00:08:04.427]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wrist Ease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[00:08:04.967 --> 00:08:09.208]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[00:08:09.208 --> 00:08:15.710]  Wristease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and makes a great stocking stuffer.
[00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:16.490]  Honest.
[00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:22.071]  Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[00:08:22.071 --> 00:08:25.312]  You can order Wristease now at Wristease.com.
[00:08:25.312 --> 00:08:26.892]  That's Wristease.

[00:08:31.733 --> 00:08:34.234]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[00:08:37.384 --> 00:08:44.009]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:44.009 --> 00:08:54.516]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:54.516 --> 00:09:01.961]  FEMA camp, admittedly a FEMA camp, for families in North Austin, in a suburb, Taylor,
[00:09:03.482 --> 00:09:19.437]  Our guys are on the ground right there, right now shooting a video, and I want them to call in at the bottom of the hour with a report on what's happening up there, and we'll give you the details of exactly what we're discussing.
[00:09:19.437 --> 00:09:29.726]  Don't have to go too far afield these days to find a FEMA camp, it's just right here in my beloved Austin, in a satellite of the city, a bedroom community.
[00:09:31.443 --> 00:09:40.131]  And we do have Michael Rivero for his once-a-month visit, his analysis that he always graces us with, coming up in the second hour.
[00:09:40.131 --> 00:09:54.204]  In the third hour, I'm going to air most of, not the entire, 24-minute, well, my favorite Twilight Zone episode, The Obsolete Man.
[00:09:54.204 --> 00:09:56.606]  Here's just the intro to that, coming up in the third hour.
[00:10:06.329 --> 00:10:08.651]  You're traveling through another dimension.
[00:10:08.651 --> 00:10:11.933]  A dimension not only of sight and sound, but of mind.
[00:10:11.933 --> 00:10:15.556]  A journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination.
[00:10:15.556 --> 00:10:16.797]  That's the signpost up ahead.
[00:10:16.797 --> 00:10:23.542]  Your next stop, the Twilight Zone.
[00:10:23.542 --> 00:10:29.967]  Wordsworth Romney obsolescence.
[00:10:29.967 --> 00:10:31.468]  He's waiting, Chancellor.
[00:10:31.468 --> 00:10:31.969]  Oh, let him in.
[00:10:42.727 --> 00:10:44.888]  Alright.
[00:10:44.888 --> 00:10:50.811]  Coming up in the third hour on this second transmission of 2007.
[00:10:50.811 --> 00:10:52.432]  2007 has a wicked ring to it.
[00:10:52.432 --> 00:10:56.714]  It's no doubt going to be a wicked year.
[00:11:02.117 --> 00:11:15.760]  But before I get into all the news here that is leviathan in front of me, let me just talk about what happened last year and what is coming up in the new year.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:23.322]  2006 was the year that the United States died.
[00:11:23.322 --> 00:11:27.263]  Now you know I've said this several times the last few months and I want to make it clear.
[00:11:27.263 --> 00:11:28.543]  I want to add some evidence today.
[00:11:31.622 --> 00:11:40.385]  That in the scale of a year, that's only a few seconds in the life of a country, of a people, of a civilization, of a way of life.
[00:11:40.385 --> 00:11:51.588]  And so, it is a premature death, and if we defibrillate, if we admit the hardest stop beating of the country is dead, by every yardstick, by every measurement, the U.S.
[00:11:51.588 --> 00:11:53.889]  is dead.
[00:11:53.889 --> 00:11:59.251]  It's cannons, it's basic tenets, it's underpinnings,
[00:12:00.905 --> 00:12:04.146]  It's physical, borders, all of it.
[00:12:04.146 --> 00:12:10.627]  If we admit how bad it is... See, that's the problem, is the denial.
[00:12:10.627 --> 00:12:13.388]  Then we can set about fixing it.
[00:12:13.388 --> 00:12:17.909]  It's like when Stalin was conservatively killing 30 million himself.
[00:12:17.909 --> 00:12:21.150]  There were denials that he was doing it.
[00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:25.431]  And he went right on doing it, and our government funded him to help him do it.
[00:12:25.431 --> 00:12:28.612]  Now it's admitted history, and even the Soviet archives admit it.
[00:12:32.131 --> 00:12:34.413]  It's time to stop living in denial, number one.
[00:12:34.413 --> 00:12:37.555]  The country is gone.
[00:12:37.555 --> 00:12:53.888]  New World Order has won a major victory, but because this country, the country itself is dead, but because the country is made up of living tissue, that is each and every one of us out there, every man, woman, and child, black, white, Hispanic, old, young, it doesn't matter.
[00:12:53.888 --> 00:13:01.614]  We can, with God's help, rise the country from the dead by passing electricity through its heart
[00:13:03.374 --> 00:13:13.141]  But if we haven't turned it around in the next few years, you can stick a fork in us, and we're done.
[00:13:13.141 --> 00:13:21.948]  Now, Europe was deep in the EU, and now when the final steps were being laid to reduce it to absolute despotism, the people pulled back
[00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:28.014]  The first time they were ever able to have a vote, by the way, on EU expansion and voted it down in every major country.
[00:13:28.014 --> 00:13:29.395]  Same thing happened in Latin America.
[00:13:29.395 --> 00:13:36.701]  So we see whole regions, whole countries, whole areas rising from the dead.
[00:13:36.701 --> 00:13:51.332]  But still around our necks are these ravenous New World Order goblins still feeding in a bloody froth at our necks, whispering in our ear
[00:13:52.105 --> 00:13:58.128]  While they do it, while they chew our feet off that they're our friends keeping us safe from terrorists, just look at them!
[00:13:58.128 --> 00:13:59.229]  Look at their fruits!
[00:13:59.229 --> 00:14:03.111]  No, they're a wicked lot!
[00:14:03.111 --> 00:14:08.273]  They are our enemies!
[00:14:08.273 --> 00:14:13.716]  They have used the good name of this country for their global empire and turned us from the most loved to the most hated!
[00:14:17.364 --> 00:14:24.807]  So when I say 2006 is the year the United States died, I mean it.
[00:14:24.807 --> 00:14:39.112]  It is the year that the agreement signed in March of the previous year went into effect, and according to Council on Foreign Relations news releases and SPP.gov governmental releases, it is on track or ahead of schedule, depending on the two releases.
[00:14:39.112 --> 00:14:42.213]  On track, ahead of schedule.
[00:14:42.213 --> 00:14:44.533]  Robert Pasteur and others have said.
[00:14:44.533 --> 00:14:46.114]  Co-chairman, Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:14:47.526 --> 00:14:50.192]  On the SPP Advisory Board.
[00:14:50.192 --> 00:14:53.799]  Run by Chertoff and the other real heads of the three governments.
[00:14:53.799 --> 00:14:55.021]  Canada, Mexico, US.
[00:14:59.326 --> 00:15:15.917]  And so they are merging our Social Security, they are merging our roads, they are merging our military, they are merging our intelligence gathering, they are merging our regulations, they are merging the 25 big federal agencies under Homeland Security with the respective agencies in Mexico and Canada.
[00:15:15.917 --> 00:15:27.544]  Through the last hundred years of financing and the corporations writing legislation, the three governments fit together like three Legos.
[00:15:27.544 --> 00:15:28.565]  Like snap tools.
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.423]  Like a jigsaw puzzle?
[00:15:34.423 --> 00:15:39.566]  It just goes together like a hand and glove, like a horse and carriage.
[00:15:39.566 --> 00:15:43.749]  All crafted, all machined, plop into place.
[00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:45.330]  And why do they want a new government?
[00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:55.176]  To erase the Bill of Rights and Constitution and any vestiges of common law in our body of law.
[00:15:56.531 --> 00:15:59.712]  They are replacing what we were with the new.
[00:15:59.712 --> 00:16:14.358]  No due process, no liberty, no freedom, no families, forced drugging, total control, no jobs of any significance, no control of your destiny, a nightmare.
[00:16:14.358 --> 00:16:15.839]  Guess what they got?
[00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:18.020]  Freedom of Information Act yesterday.
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.260]  This is Yahoo News.
[00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:26.043]  Social Security agreement with Mexico released after three and a half year Freedom of Information Act battle.
[00:16:27.771 --> 00:16:38.299]  PR Newswire, after numerous refusals over the three-and-a-half years, the Social Security Administration, SSA, has released the first known public copy of the U.S.
[00:16:38.299 --> 00:16:41.502]  Social Security Totalization.
[00:16:41.502 --> 00:16:44.684]  That's like saying, we're not for global government, we're for global governance.
[00:16:44.684 --> 00:16:45.665]  Totalization.
[00:16:45.665 --> 00:16:46.926]  Merger.
[00:16:46.926 --> 00:16:51.389]  U.S.-Mexico Social Security Totalization Agreement.
[00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:53.471]  That's merger.
[00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:55.353]  Totalization means merging all the numbers.
[00:16:55.353 --> 00:16:55.533]  The total.
[00:16:56.661 --> 00:17:11.680]  The government was forced to make the disclosure in response to lawsuits filed under Freedom of Information Act by the TREA Senior Citizens League, the second largest senior citizens organization in the U.S.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.145]  Dwarfed by AARP, which is totally bought and paid for by the globalists.
[00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:22.301]  The totalization agreement could allow millions of illegal Mexican workers to draw billions of dollars from the U.S.
[00:17:22.301 --> 00:17:24.522]  Social Security Trust Fund.
[00:17:24.522 --> 00:17:25.843]  The agreement between the U.S.
[00:17:25.843 --> 00:17:31.865]  and Mexico was signed in June of 2004 and is awaiting President Bush's signature.
[00:17:31.865 --> 00:17:45.210]  Once President Bush approves the agreement, which could be done without Congress's vote, either house of Congress, neither house, would have 60 days to disapprove the agreement by voting to reject it.
[00:17:47.313 --> 00:17:52.257]  The Social Security Administration itself warns that Social Security is within decades of bankruptcy.
[00:17:52.257 --> 00:17:53.438]  It's already bankrupt.
[00:17:53.438 --> 00:18:06.590]  Yet they seem to have no problem making arrangements and agreements that hasten its demise, said Ralph McCutcheon, Chairman of the TREA Senior Citizens League.
[00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:10.513]  Okay.
[00:18:10.513 --> 00:18:13.296]  They're merging every department, every agency.
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.561]  I mean, look at this story right here.
[00:18:17.561 --> 00:18:38.651]  They're not just in name merging the agencies and the laws and the regulations that this North American SPP group just writes up and then the heads of the agencies just implement without Congress even knowing what's going on or having any oversight.
[00:18:39.784 --> 00:18:41.904]  They're physically getting rid of the border.
[00:18:41.904 --> 00:18:58.248]  They're physically coming in and lobbying and buying up the politicians at the state level who then hand the roads over to these international bodies and their subsidiary companies and governmental organizations both, public-private partnership.
[00:18:58.248 --> 00:19:04.669]  We also have the taxation systems being equalized and being merged.
[00:19:06.815 --> 00:19:09.117]  And we have our military.
[00:19:09.117 --> 00:19:17.682]  20% of the ground troops in Iraq are non-citizens.
[00:19:17.682 --> 00:19:34.373]  And if you go read the actual text of testimony before Congress last year, they're saying that by 2010, half of ground forces, infantry forces, in the Marine Corps and the Army are projected to be
[00:19:35.823 --> 00:19:42.045]  Non-citizen.
[00:19:42.045 --> 00:19:50.049]  And the Boston Globe reports they're, quote, considering expanding the number of non-citizens in the ranks and expanding recruiting stations overseas.
[00:19:50.049 --> 00:19:59.092]  The average American has no idea there's recruiting stations overseas in the Philippines and Mexico City, from Manila to Mexico City, and in Eastern Europe.
[00:19:59.989 --> 00:20:04.172]  They have no idea they're recruiting convicted felons, aggravated felons.
[00:20:04.172 --> 00:20:05.834]  That's been, though, in the news.
[00:20:05.834 --> 00:20:08.315]  But back of the paper?
[00:20:08.315 --> 00:20:11.818]  I mean, you can't get any more New World Order than that.
[00:20:11.818 --> 00:20:17.102]  When we come back, I'll continue with the evidence of the death of the United States in 2006.
[00:20:17.102 --> 00:20:19.324]  And then we'll look forward into 2007.
[00:20:19.324 --> 00:20:27.050]  The year of the primacy of the American Union.
[00:20:27.728 --> 00:20:31.569]  And all this data I'm putting out fits into both these columns.
[00:20:31.569 --> 00:20:32.250]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:32.830]  Stay with me.
[00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:37.892]  Infowars.com.
[00:20:37.892 --> 00:20:40.232]  Hi folks, Jack Browner here from Midas Resources.
[00:20:40.232 --> 00:20:44.834]  The real money folks.
[00:20:44.834 --> 00:20:47.255]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:20:47.255 --> 00:20:48.175]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.161]  The Dow has ranged from 9,800 to 10,300.
[00:20:53.161 --> 00:20:56.082]  A 5% increase.
[00:20:56.082 --> 00:21:02.124]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the Euro.
[00:21:02.124 --> 00:21:06.086]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[00:21:06.086 --> 00:21:07.266]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:08.187]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:15.914]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[00:22:36.772 --> 00:22:40.034]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:40.034 --> 00:22:43.416]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[00:22:43.416 --> 00:22:54.342]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech?
[00:22:55.109 --> 00:23:00.512]  Freedom of religion and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny.
[00:23:00.512 --> 00:23:06.555]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[00:23:06.555 --> 00:23:14.439]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:22.103 --> 00:23:28.485]  The call is free.

[00:23:39.288 --> 00:23:41.728]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:23:41.728 --> 00:23:44.109]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:23:44.924 --> 00:23:54.308]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:23:54.308 --> 00:23:59.850]  Now it's cancer's turn to die, with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.

[00:24:14.702 --> 00:24:15.863]  Or visit www.laysmedinc.com.
[00:24:15.863 --> 00:24:16.983]  That's www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:24:36.291 --> 00:24:38.251]  Welcome back.
[00:24:38.251 --> 00:24:41.972]  So, 2006 is the year America died.
[00:24:41.972 --> 00:24:48.954]  It's been a long, laborious program to do it, but they officially
[00:25:05.186 --> 00:25:19.698]  After carrying out the terror attacks that took all the bureaucracies under the control of Homeland Security, that Homeland Security could implement the merger without Congress's oversight with Mexico and Canada.
[00:25:19.698 --> 00:25:23.301]  And then now they're advertising the North American Union as a way to keep us all safe.
[00:25:23.301 --> 00:25:24.262]  I'll never forget U.N.
[00:25:24.262 --> 00:25:34.670]  General McKenzie the Wednesday after, a week after 9-11, I guess eight days after 9-11, saying that we're going to have a continental security perimeter.
[00:25:36.222 --> 00:25:38.064]  uh... with with mexican u.s.
[00:25:38.064 --> 00:26:02.025]  and canadian troops patrolling the physical border of north america down from the uh... from alaska down to the border of mexico and guatemala and then now i'll robert pastor and others have been in the men in the press and on cnn saying the exact same thing the only thing that'll keep you safe from terrorist is a north american union and that uh... these guys are incredible
[00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:10.093]  And, of course, I was watching an old C-SPAN CFR meeting last night, getting clips out of it for a film I'm making, and there they were there!
[00:26:10.093 --> 00:26:19.617]  It was the Gary Hart-Rudman-Warren-Rudman Commission, which every one of their recommendations, all 50 of them, got implemented to the letter.
[00:26:19.617 --> 00:26:27.681]  Department of Homeland Security, Patriot Act, just every one of the things had already been written and packaged and was prepared.
[00:26:29.964 --> 00:26:34.169]  And so we do not have a border.
[00:26:34.169 --> 00:26:44.820]  They are with the new blanket amnesty program that they're set to reintroduce in the next few days as Congress prepares to reconvene this week.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:49.145]  The Democrats' first order of business is a hate crimes law to restrict free speech.
[00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:54.391]  And, of course, a guest worker blanket amnesty program.
[00:26:54.391 --> 00:26:58.612]  They, again, are merging our social security systems.
[00:26:58.612 --> 00:27:02.753]  They are recruiting heavily out of the third world to make up our military.
[00:27:02.753 --> 00:27:04.354]  Of course, non-U.S.
[00:27:04.354 --> 00:27:06.274]  citizens are more likely to fire on U.S.
[00:27:06.274 --> 00:27:08.775]  citizens and to follow orders.
[00:27:08.775 --> 00:27:14.676]  Every empire, when it oppresses its own people, brings in foreign troops to do the job.
[00:27:14.676 --> 00:27:17.397]  Of course, these will be foreign troops in our uniforms.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.701]  As we told you they would.
[00:27:19.701 --> 00:27:26.626]  We went to Urban Warfare Drills from Louisiana to California and showed you the footage of it.
[00:27:26.626 --> 00:27:36.613]  This has been a long, long program now coming to fruition.
[00:27:36.613 --> 00:27:43.278]  So 2007 was the year, will be the year, of the American Union really standing on its own two feet.
[00:27:43.278 --> 00:27:45.699]  And this will be the test of it.
[00:27:45.699 --> 00:27:47.721]  Will the American people wake up to it?
[00:27:48.843 --> 00:27:51.004]  And it's different programs.
[00:27:51.004 --> 00:27:57.227]  Will they realize how dire the situation is, or will they capitulate and accept it?
[00:27:57.227 --> 00:28:12.194]  Simultaneously, in 2007, they're announcing from Indiana to Texas, from Oregon to New York, that foreign companies are being given, if you really look at the deals, they're being given at fire sale prices.
[00:28:13.854 --> 00:28:21.979]  The infrastructure, the ports, the roads, to be used as taxing mechanisms to fund the North American Union.
[00:28:21.979 --> 00:28:29.163]  When they seize a major interstate highway or a farm to market road, say in Texas, and place toll roads on existing roads,
[00:28:29.981 --> 00:28:48.314]  It is apportioned out to the city, the county, the state, the federal government, and then a large portion to be rolled into an SPP, Security and Prosperity Partnership, funding mechanism, this has all been announced, to even quote, build roads in Mexico!
[00:28:48.314 --> 00:28:51.717]  This is a signed agreement, Congress isn't involved.
[00:28:51.717 --> 00:28:54.499]  A signed agreement between the bureaucracies of our government
[00:28:55.550 --> 00:29:11.453]  And the Mexican and Canadian governments to take our tax money and build the superhighway that goes south out of Texas down to the west coast of Mexico where the Chinese goods will flow in.
[00:29:11.453 --> 00:29:19.035]  And again, everybody gets focused on the NAFTA superhighway I-35, which I am literally three miles from right where I sit.
[00:29:19.941 --> 00:29:22.483]  That is only one major artery.
[00:29:22.483 --> 00:29:32.309]  They are grabbing 82, this is in the SPP documents, 82 existing, and if you count them, there's only 85 interstate highways.
[00:29:32.309 --> 00:29:40.135]  So there's 82 others plus I-35, that's 83 of the 85.
[00:29:40.135 --> 00:29:44.658]  Already slated to go under this, and they're throwing toll roads down on them right now.
[00:29:46.167 --> 00:29:51.310]  And that money's going to be taken and put into the bureaucracy to fund the further dismantling.
[00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:57.053]  I mean, if they grab the infrastructure of any country, especially its roads, the heart of an infrastructure, in the U.S.
[00:29:57.053 --> 00:30:01.175]  it's even worse because we're totally dependent on roads.
[00:30:01.175 --> 00:30:07.939]  And we are a sprawling civilization compared to Europe or Japan.
[00:30:07.939 --> 00:30:09.360]  So it is a bloodless coup.
[00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:16.273]  The military-industrial complex figured out that they could take over foreign countries, but why not just take over the one that funded them?
[00:30:16.273 --> 00:30:19.975]  The one that, you know, where they grew in their own bosom.
[00:30:19.975 --> 00:30:22.977]  They are overthrowing the people and putting themselves into power.
[00:30:22.977 --> 00:30:23.798]  It always happens.
[00:30:23.798 --> 00:30:26.579]  It's happening again.
[00:30:26.579 --> 00:30:27.960]  We're on the march.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.581]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:29.581 --> 00:30:33.163]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:36.929 --> 00:30:39.531]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:30:39.531 --> 00:30:41.713]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:30:41.713 --> 00:30:49.018]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:30:49.018 --> 00:30:57.945]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[00:31:36.756 --> 00:31:40.941]  I found this company online and they have this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[00:31:40.941 --> 00:31:44.765]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[00:31:44.765 --> 00:31:49.129]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[00:31:49.129 --> 00:31:50.311]  I was so amazed.
[00:31:50.311 --> 00:31:53.334]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight.
[00:31:53.334 --> 00:31:55.196]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[00:31:55.576 --> 00:32:01.260]  SoleilWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:07.444]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[00:32:07.444 --> 00:32:09.426]  I figured it would clean really well.
[00:32:09.426 --> 00:32:12.808]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[00:32:12.808 --> 00:32:16.951]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[00:32:16.951 --> 00:32:18.432]  Plus, the service was great.

[00:32:36.698 --> 00:32:41.159]  Have you ever wondered about what the Mark of the Beast is in Chapter 13 of Revelation?
[00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:43.659]  What does 666 really mean?
[00:32:43.659 --> 00:32:46.360]  Or about the Harlot Church of Revelation 17?
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.460]  Or about the Beast of Daniel in Revelation?
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:52.401]  Speculation abounds about these ancient prophecies and what they might mean today.
[00:32:52.401 --> 00:33:01.243]  Now, one of the foremost scholars on geopolitics and popular talk show guest, Dr. Michael Kaufman has just released a DVD called, World Events and Prophecy.
[00:33:01.243 --> 00:33:05.244]  Dr. Michael Kaufman is recognized for his penetrating analyses of global events.
[00:33:05.564 --> 00:33:13.129]  And has used his information to almost single-handedly stop the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity from being ratified by the U.S.
[00:33:13.129 --> 00:33:16.731]  Senate, one hour before the Senate was to vote to ratify it.
[00:33:16.731 --> 00:33:22.794]  Order World Events and Prophecy now, and see why those who have seen it say it is one of the best DVDs on the subject.
[00:33:22.794 --> 00:33:26.617]  Order now at discerningtoday.org, or call toll-free 877-271-7639.
[00:33:26.617 --> 00:33:27.017]  That's 877-271-7639.
[00:33:27.017 --> 00:33:27.878]  Don't be caught off guard.
[00:33:51.523 --> 00:33:59.729]  Your own personal Jesus.
[00:33:59.729 --> 00:34:02.611]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[00:34:02.611 --> 00:34:07.074]  Someone who cares.
[00:34:07.074 --> 00:34:11.957]  Your own personal Jesus.
[00:34:15.291 --> 00:34:18.193]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[00:34:18.193 --> 00:34:20.295]  Someone who's there.
[00:34:20.295 --> 00:34:24.638]  Feeling unknown and you're all alone.
[00:34:34.737 --> 00:34:43.963]  Welcome back.
[00:34:43.963 --> 00:34:46.545]  Thank you, Johnny Cash.
[00:34:46.545 --> 00:34:54.810]  I'll tell you right now, my friends, that I'm honored to be your host.
[00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:58.213]  I'm honored to be here Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 p.m.
[00:34:58.213 --> 00:35:01.835]  Central, on the one and only Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:35:01.835 --> 00:35:03.196]  I'm proud of this network.
[00:35:03.911 --> 00:35:05.651]  And the great work it's done over the years.
[00:35:05.651 --> 00:35:15.673]  I always do want to remind you, listeners, that if you hear my voice endorsing a product, that means I believe in it, and I think that you should get it or that it would be helpful for you.
[00:35:15.673 --> 00:35:22.714]  That does not necessarily mean that I agree with everything else you hear with other sponsors or information.
[00:35:22.714 --> 00:35:24.315]  And that goes two ways.
[00:35:24.315 --> 00:35:30.656]  That means necessarily some of the other shows on this network may not completely agree with the things I say or do, or their sponsors may not agree with me.
[00:35:31.633 --> 00:35:34.554]  Same thing for our fine affiliates out there.
[00:35:34.554 --> 00:35:38.275]  All the time I get calls or emails going, well this is on a station you're on.
[00:35:38.275 --> 00:35:39.055]  Do you agree with that?
[00:35:39.055 --> 00:35:41.296]  And I'm like, I'm not my brother's keeper.
[00:35:41.296 --> 00:35:47.298]  I'm here doing a radio show, trying to run my own life, which I have a lot of trouble doing.
[00:35:47.298 --> 00:35:49.039]  Alright, back live here.
[00:35:49.039 --> 00:35:53.120]  We're supposed to get a call in the next ten minutes from Kevin Smith and Aaron Dykes.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.941]  They're out on the scene of the FEMA camp.
[00:35:57.236 --> 00:36:00.359]  That is north of Austin in Taylor.
[00:36:00.359 --> 00:36:06.385]  I talked to them about 10 minutes ago and they were arriving and there have been a bunch of different protests out there.
[00:36:06.385 --> 00:36:08.067]  There was scheduled to be one there today.
[00:36:08.067 --> 00:36:12.171]  Counterpunch wrote about it today and did plug InfoWars for coverage of it.
[00:36:12.171 --> 00:36:12.872]  We appreciate that.
[00:36:13.855 --> 00:36:16.937]  And so we're out there physically covering it right now.
[00:36:16.937 --> 00:36:18.398]  I'll give you a report there.
[00:36:18.398 --> 00:36:21.539]  Michael Rivera will be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:36:21.539 --> 00:36:23.280]  We'll have open phones during an interview.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.121]  He's going to be joining us.
[00:36:24.121 --> 00:36:26.682]  I think he starts his first show this weekend.
[00:36:26.682 --> 00:36:30.304]  He'll be doing a weekend show, a news show, here on the Genesis Network.
[00:36:30.304 --> 00:36:31.625]  We're excited about that.
[00:36:31.625 --> 00:36:39.709]  And I'm going to air most of the early 1960s Twilight Zone episode of The Obsolete Man.
[00:36:41.607 --> 00:36:45.550]  I think it's powerful, it's informative, and I want to comment on it somewhere.
[00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:49.734]  Not the whole thing, but a large portion of it and comment on it and analyze it.
[00:36:49.734 --> 00:36:53.217]  Getting back to 2006, the year America died.
[00:36:53.217 --> 00:37:03.126]  2007, the year the American Union will either stand or fall.
[00:37:03.126 --> 00:37:08.050]  And I was mentioning before we ran into that break that
[00:37:09.571 --> 00:37:10.532]  It's simple.
[00:37:10.532 --> 00:37:23.361]  You've got big, powerful, global corporations that took over the banking system of England in 1801, and really cemented that control in 1806.
[00:37:23.361 --> 00:37:29.226]  They took over the Dutch banking system there shortly thereafter.
[00:37:29.226 --> 00:37:32.068]  They took over the French banking system before that.
[00:37:32.068 --> 00:37:37.832]  They took over our banking system entirely in 1913, and so you have a few private families
[00:37:39.139 --> 00:38:06.316]  The Sachs-Coburg Gothas, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Warburgs, there's less than 20 families, and they own the private stock in the central banks, and if your country doesn't have their central bank in control of it, they will hop up some reason, or fund rebels, or run a coup d'etat, and come blow your capital up, or do whatever they have to do, or poison your water supply, or stage terror attacks and blame it on you, and they'll come in and take over your nation!
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.161]  And they used the U.S.
[00:38:13.161 --> 00:38:20.066]  from 1913 on as an engine to fund the Soviets, to fund the Nazis, to build up threats, to then knock down the threats.
[00:38:20.066 --> 00:38:23.709]  They always financed both sides.
[00:38:23.709 --> 00:38:25.691]  And then now they've decided to use the U.S.
[00:38:25.691 --> 00:38:28.253]  up, like they did Germany and the Soviet Union.
[00:38:28.253 --> 00:38:29.814]  They've got us out doing their wicked work.
[00:38:30.416 --> 00:38:39.762]  While owning the media that tells people domestically that we're doing a good job, while the very media the globalists own overseas demonizes us and blames Americans for everything when we're just their puppets.
[00:38:39.762 --> 00:38:42.925]  I want to make that clear to the world listening, okay?
[00:38:42.925 --> 00:38:45.526]  You cannot entirely blame the United States for this.
[00:38:45.526 --> 00:38:52.731]  You can blame us for being slovenly, lazy, uninformed, but milk and honey does that to any people.
[00:38:52.731 --> 00:38:57.795]  I'd like to see some other nation that's been on top for hundreds of years and not see them turn into a bunch of decadent scum.
[00:39:00.626 --> 00:39:02.527]  There's still a lot of good people in this country.
[00:39:02.527 --> 00:39:05.289]  I don't appreciate those out there, bad-mouthed in the U.S.
[00:39:05.289 --> 00:39:08.351]  And I don't appreciate the liberals in the U.N.
[00:39:08.351 --> 00:39:17.638]  who are part of the false left-right system and the false bipolar dichotomy claiming that America did all this, Noam Chomsky and the rest of those people.
[00:39:17.638 --> 00:39:21.761]  MIT, government paycheck boy, always blaming the U.S.
[00:39:21.761 --> 00:39:22.481]  like the U.S.
[00:39:22.481 --> 00:39:23.442]  is the elite.
[00:39:23.442 --> 00:39:24.622]  The U.S.
[00:39:24.622 --> 00:39:28.065]  is the foot soldier of the New World Order, a capo at best.
[00:39:32.046 --> 00:39:34.027]  Same thing goes for England.
[00:39:34.027 --> 00:39:39.549]  A good, virtuous, hard-working people that ended slavery worldwide.
[00:39:39.549 --> 00:39:41.529]  Black slavery.
[00:39:41.529 --> 00:39:47.211]  Where the ideas of common law grew and developed out of the law of Mount Sinai.
[00:39:47.211 --> 00:39:49.032]  And were perfected.
[00:39:49.032 --> 00:39:50.132]  And were brought forward.
[00:39:50.132 --> 00:39:55.534]  And that it was almost half the people in the House of Commons that supported the U.S.
[00:39:55.534 --> 00:39:56.254]  in its founding.
[00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:02.750]  Don't blame England.
[00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:11.132]  We have been hijacked because we have the force of arms, we had the wealth, we had the virtuous, informed, dynamic population.
[00:40:11.132 --> 00:40:19.613]  So of course the parasites came in and got control of our central nervous systems, our central governments, expanded the power of the central governments.
[00:40:19.613 --> 00:40:24.994]  The globalists come into countries, they get control of the central government, then they expand the power of the central government.
[00:40:24.994 --> 00:40:27.795]  Once they seize full control of a nation, they then turn it
[00:40:28.415 --> 00:40:33.020]  As a engine of warfare to dominate other nations.
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:38.405]  Once they take those countries over, they then turn them into engines to dominate their neighbors.
[00:40:38.405 --> 00:40:44.791]  Or if it's an imperial power, to project the power.
[00:40:44.791 --> 00:40:48.415]  Out of their own geographic, regional configuration.
[00:40:51.303 --> 00:40:52.303]  So it's real simple.
[00:40:52.303 --> 00:40:53.864]  Private interest took over the U.S.
[00:40:53.864 --> 00:40:55.805]  They took over our military industrial complex.
[00:40:55.805 --> 00:41:02.328]  They grew it with our tax money into the greatest colossal militarily ever seen on this planet.
[00:41:02.328 --> 00:41:09.911]  And they are now in the final stages of debasing our currency, trying to buy up the world by printing the dollar just until it's worth almost nothing.
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:23.570]  Then, they've now taken dollars, made foreign investments, they shift those dollars into foreign currencies, and come back and buy up what infrastructure, and what ideas, and what companies, and what structures are left here domestically.
[00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:32.957]  It's always a sifting, a centrifugal black hole, destroying middle classes, destroying independence, destroying family, always monopolizing.
[00:41:32.957 --> 00:41:38.182]  These are monopoly men.
[00:41:38.182 --> 00:41:39.142]  It's what they do.
[00:41:39.142 --> 00:41:39.883]  It's all they do.
[00:41:42.074 --> 00:41:43.514]  So we're going to set about beating them.
[00:41:43.514 --> 00:41:47.135]  We have to admit who they are, the New World Order Crime Syndicate.
[00:41:47.135 --> 00:41:49.196]  We have to name them.
[00:41:49.196 --> 00:41:52.217]  We have to expose their programs and their operations.
[00:41:52.217 --> 00:41:56.978]  And then people on the left and the right can wake up and see that both parties are controlled.
[00:41:56.978 --> 00:42:04.740]  And while they'll have us fight over petty football issues, petty issues that at the end of the day will never be decided or don't matter to begin with,
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:11.484]  People can then see how Hillary and Bush are on the same page on every real issue.
[00:42:11.484 --> 00:42:15.166]  They're moving forward against us.
[00:42:15.166 --> 00:42:23.092]  I mean, how can I have tens of thousands of what you'd call classical liberals around the country who are anti-gun out buying guns?
[00:42:23.092 --> 00:42:27.375]  Realize that they didn't give up their peace position.
[00:42:27.375 --> 00:42:31.958]  They now realize that it is a position of strength that will give us domestic peace.
[00:42:35.194 --> 00:42:44.061]  Why do we have the left out there now realizing the environmental movement's been totally taken over by big corporations and is used as a front to steal private property?
[00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:53.128]  Because we don't sit here like a bunch of political whores making excuses for the Republican Party, which is a pack of villainous vermin.
[00:42:55.954 --> 00:43:02.216]  Conversely, we have conservatives listening to this program because they know we're just covering the issues.
[00:43:02.216 --> 00:43:08.297]  And we can demonstrate to them that George Bush is no conservative.
[00:43:08.297 --> 00:43:12.878]  You see, they want to keep you in that left-right debate, which is false.
[00:43:12.878 --> 00:43:21.200]  And while you're busy clawing each other's eyes out, the elite moves forward.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.581]  Just like our government for 50 years has funded textbooks and comic books,
[00:43:25.339 --> 00:43:34.707]  In Mexico, through the Ford Foundation, with 24 billion dollars in its coffers, to say the Southwest belongs to Mexico, break up the country, fight with each other.
[00:43:34.707 --> 00:43:38.490]  They want us fighting with each other.
[00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:47.057]  Frankly, if that La Reconquista idea hadn't been engineered into all the illegal aliens, I wouldn't be that opposed to having 30 million of them up here.
[00:43:47.057 --> 00:43:50.059]  But the globalists set it up for divide and conquer.
[00:43:53.559 --> 00:44:10.811]  Because before they merge countries completely, they first have ethnic strife to then balkanize the original governments to weaken them and then roll that into a larger structure.
[00:44:10.811 --> 00:44:12.472]  So, it's simple.
[00:44:12.472 --> 00:44:18.116]  The military-industrial complex that funds 90 plus percent of university research
[00:44:20.123 --> 00:44:21.824]  Owns our schools, owns our media.
[00:44:21.824 --> 00:44:24.824]  It itself is owned by the private banking families.
[00:44:24.824 --> 00:44:26.985]  And they just took over the U.S.
[00:44:26.985 --> 00:44:29.546]  like they took over every other major country.
[00:44:29.546 --> 00:44:34.087]  There's a handful of nations left that aren't under their control.
[00:44:34.087 --> 00:44:36.728]  A handful.
[00:44:36.728 --> 00:44:41.309]  You could count it on two hands.
[00:44:41.309 --> 00:44:45.330]  And they'll show you the problems of those countries, the bad leaders of those countries.
[00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:46.530]  I'm not debating that.
[00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:48.751]  And then they'll say, oh, see, we should go take them over because they're bad.
[00:44:50.327 --> 00:44:52.688]  The good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:44:52.688 --> 00:44:53.568]  That doesn't matter.
[00:44:53.568 --> 00:44:59.890]  The point is, they're not under the global crime syndicates control, so they're a threat to it, period.
[00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:04.472]  And those countries do not threaten you, those rogue nations.
[00:45:04.472 --> 00:45:12.295]  Some of them do, to a certain extent, because our government armed them, like North Korea and China.
[00:45:12.295 --> 00:45:13.535]  The best enemy's money can buy.
[00:45:17.668 --> 00:45:20.429]  You have Kevin on the line, but he can't come on quite yet.
[00:45:20.429 --> 00:45:20.689]  Why?
[00:45:20.689 --> 00:45:23.630]  Because he's... You'll tell me at the break.
[00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:26.210]  What, he's interviewing people, or?
[00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:29.972]  I mean, I knew this would happen.
[00:45:29.972 --> 00:45:45.576]  He's out there at the little FEMA camp, and... Well, he may come on then while Rivero's on with us.
[00:45:45.576 --> 00:45:45.836]  Alright.
[00:45:48.357 --> 00:45:54.082]  So, we need to look at who this elite are.
[00:45:54.082 --> 00:45:55.183]  What have they done in the past?
[00:45:55.183 --> 00:45:56.264]  Who have they funded?
[00:45:56.264 --> 00:45:57.645]  What is their modus operandi?
[00:45:57.645 --> 00:45:59.787]  What's their signature?
[00:45:59.787 --> 00:46:00.648]  What's their wavelength?
[00:46:00.648 --> 00:46:02.570]  Where are they coming from?
[00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:04.792]  They enjoy enslavement.
[00:46:04.792 --> 00:46:06.393]  They enjoy dumbing you down.
[00:46:06.393 --> 00:46:08.275]  They enjoy taking everything you've got.
[00:46:08.275 --> 00:46:12.579]  They are threatened by any independence of any type, anywhere.
[00:46:13.863 --> 00:46:14.863]  They condition you.
[00:46:14.863 --> 00:46:15.823]  They brainwash you.
[00:46:15.823 --> 00:46:17.104]  They dumb you down.
[00:46:17.104 --> 00:46:21.464]  They train our women and our men to fight with each other.
[00:46:21.464 --> 00:46:22.625]  North against South.
[00:46:22.625 --> 00:46:23.625]  East against West.
[00:46:23.625 --> 00:46:24.665]  Woman against man.
[00:46:24.665 --> 00:46:26.045]  Child against parents.
[00:46:26.045 --> 00:46:28.026]  Black against white.
[00:46:28.026 --> 00:46:30.026]  White against Hispanic.
[00:46:30.026 --> 00:46:35.787]  Chinese against Vietnamese against Japanese.
[00:46:35.787 --> 00:46:38.768]  Black tribe against the tribe across the river.
[00:46:38.768 --> 00:46:40.028]  Catholic against Protestant.
[00:46:43.297 --> 00:46:52.667]  And while everybody's busy fighting with each other, they move forward.
[00:46:52.667 --> 00:46:57.693]  So, this will be the year.
[00:46:57.693 --> 00:46:58.654]  Make it or break it.
[00:46:58.654 --> 00:47:04.360]  It's like fourth and five, sudden death over time.
[00:47:10.644 --> 00:47:12.445]  And we are having successes.
[00:47:12.445 --> 00:47:14.665]  The globalists are being more revealed than ever.
[00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:16.646]  They are more hated than ever.
[00:47:16.646 --> 00:47:20.107]  Again, 84% of Americans do not trust either political party now.
[00:47:20.107 --> 00:47:23.929]  We've never seen a number like that, anything near that in polls.
[00:47:23.929 --> 00:47:25.409]  So they've blown their cover!
[00:47:25.409 --> 00:47:28.290]  And we always said that would be our key opportunity.
[00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:36.413]  To wake up as many as we could before the North American Union was formed, before the government staged more terror, before we got deep into endgame.
[00:47:37.603 --> 00:47:40.324]  That's what FEMA, by the way, calls all these camps they're building.
[00:47:40.324 --> 00:47:41.444]  That's better than the Houston Chronicle.
[00:47:41.444 --> 00:47:42.724]  They call it Endgame.
[00:47:42.724 --> 00:47:44.705]  The program is called Endgame.
[00:47:44.705 --> 00:48:06.131]  Before we got into Endgame, to wake up as many as we could, so that when we went into Endgame, we would have the educated, informed, motivated cadres operating as lone wolf groups across the nation and the world to organize even larger resistance once it became clear to the average sheep.
[00:48:07.358 --> 00:48:09.900]  The average sheeple.
[00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:11.081]  And now we're there.
[00:48:11.081 --> 00:48:12.381]  They are waking up.
[00:48:12.381 --> 00:48:13.862]  They still don't know the full scope.
[00:48:13.862 --> 00:48:16.204]  They don't have a geopolitical gauge.
[00:48:16.204 --> 00:48:17.585]  But they know things are corrupt.
[00:48:17.585 --> 00:48:18.946]  They sense things are bad.
[00:48:18.946 --> 00:48:20.827]  They now know America's dying.
[00:48:20.827 --> 00:48:23.989]  They don't know it's dead.
[00:48:23.989 --> 00:48:26.951]  They know that they're being lied to.
[00:48:26.951 --> 00:48:29.353]  They know they're being lied to about 9-11.
[00:48:29.353 --> 00:48:30.594]  They know the war is a lie.
[00:48:30.594 --> 00:48:32.295]  I mean, what better example
[00:48:33.445 --> 00:48:39.627]  Millions of signatures signed in different positions for impeachment of Bush.
[00:48:39.627 --> 00:48:49.030]  He's a puppet, but it's important to punish him because it sends a message to this government, to both sides, that the people will punish you.
[00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:52.551]  That if you follow the orders of the globalists, you will get in trouble.
[00:48:52.551 --> 00:49:01.534]  And it's a message to the world that we don't condone what America has been used for.
[00:49:01.534 --> 00:49:02.554]  It's very important.
[00:49:07.208 --> 00:49:12.331]  Seventy-eight percent of Americans in index polls want us out of Iraq.
[00:49:12.331 --> 00:49:15.053]  Seventy percent of the troops.
[00:49:15.053 --> 00:49:15.874]  What's their answer?
[00:49:15.874 --> 00:49:19.416]  Bush has announced that they are going to expand the number of troops.
[00:49:19.416 --> 00:49:21.317]  He's going to give a speech today or tomorrow.
[00:49:21.317 --> 00:49:34.165]  They're saying, and they are now announcing, well here I have the BBC right here, they are now announcing that of course they were never going to train forty-four brigades of Iraqi
[00:49:35.843 --> 00:49:37.063]  National Guard.
[00:49:37.063 --> 00:49:38.344]  Of course that was never going to work.
[00:49:38.344 --> 00:49:39.384]  They never wanted that to work.
[00:49:39.384 --> 00:49:43.025]  They disbanded their military immediately.
[00:49:43.025 --> 00:49:46.266]  All the top generals and statisticians said, don't disband them.
[00:49:46.266 --> 00:49:47.447]  It'll be endless civil war.
[00:49:47.447 --> 00:49:48.487]  Well, of course they did.
[00:49:48.487 --> 00:49:50.267]  They won endless civil war.
[00:49:50.267 --> 00:49:53.648]  So now they're backing away from that fraud and just saying, no, there's going to be more U.S.
[00:49:53.648 --> 00:49:55.709]  troops.
[00:49:55.709 --> 00:49:57.530]  Bush will reveal Iraq troop boost.
[00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:57.770]  U.S.
[00:49:57.770 --> 00:50:02.651]  President George W. Bush intends to reveal a new Iraq strategy within days.
[00:50:02.651 --> 00:50:04.352]  The BBC has learned.
[00:50:04.352 --> 00:50:05.292]  The speech will reveal.
[00:50:06.039 --> 00:50:07.420]  I plan to send more U.S.
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:15.324]  troops to Iraq to focus on ways of bringing greater security rather than training Iraqi forces.
[00:50:15.324 --> 00:50:32.254]  The move comes with figures from Iraqi ministers suggesting that deaths among civilians are at record highs and there isn't one trained brigade or even smaller unit of a brigade that is in combat order that is non-U.S.
[00:50:33.903 --> 00:50:38.946]  And the British are downsizing, the Spanish have pulled out, the Poles pulled out a long time ago.
[00:50:38.946 --> 00:50:39.327]  The U.S.
[00:50:39.327 --> 00:50:46.371]  President arrived back in Washington today after a week-long holiday at his ranch in Texas.
[00:50:46.371 --> 00:50:55.938]  The BBC was told by a senior administration source that the speech setting out changes in Mr. Bush's Iraq policy is likely to come in the middle of next week.
[00:50:55.938 --> 00:50:59.480]  Its central theme will be sacrifice.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.522]  The speech, the BBC has been told, involves increasing troop numbers.
[00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:09.012]  And increasing profits for defense contractors, I would add.
[00:51:09.012 --> 00:51:14.455]  The exact mission of the extra troops in Iraq is still unclear.
[00:51:14.455 --> 00:51:20.338]  According to officials, but it's likely to focus on providing security rather than training Iraqi forces.
[00:51:20.338 --> 00:51:22.919]  They never meant to train them.
[00:51:22.919 --> 00:51:23.900]  It was meant to fail.
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:28.242]  It was meant to be a black hole, a tar baby.
[00:51:28.242 --> 00:51:30.043]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:30.043 --> 00:51:30.543]  Stay with me.
[00:51:39.142 --> 00:51:44.945]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:44.945 --> 00:51:52.608]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:52:00.743]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:52:00.743 --> 00:52:12.488]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:52:12.488 --> 00:52:16.450]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:18.691]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:52:18.691 --> 00:52:22.473]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:35.894 --> 00:52:38.076]  Dad, can we stop?
[00:52:38.076 --> 00:52:40.018]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[00:52:40.018 --> 00:52:40.618]  What?
[00:52:40.618 --> 00:52:41.399]  Again?
[00:52:41.399 --> 00:52:43.101]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[00:52:43.101 --> 00:52:47.765]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[00:52:47.765 --> 00:52:49.246]  Why did you do that?
[00:52:49.246 --> 00:52:55.332]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[00:52:55.332 --> 00:52:56.493]  Are we there yet?
[00:52:56.493 --> 00:52:57.794]  for the entire trip.
[00:52:57.794 --> 00:52:59.956]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[00:53:00.456 --> 00:53:01.757]  Great idea!
[00:53:01.757 --> 00:53:04.719]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids!
[00:53:04.719 --> 00:53:07.381]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[00:53:07.381 --> 00:53:12.045]  And using our Berkey Sport Bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[00:53:12.045 --> 00:53:12.365]  Honey!
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:14.821]  You're terrific!
[00:53:14.821 --> 00:53:16.422]  Oh, honey, so are you!
[00:53:16.422 --> 00:53:20.104]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[00:53:20.104 --> 00:53:21.385]  Now, can we stop?
[00:53:21.385 --> 00:53:22.425]  I need to go, too.

[00:54:39.788 --> 00:54:48.076]  Alright, Kevin Smith and Aaron Dykes were unable to give us a report ten minutes ago because they had ICE agents around them telling them to turn their cameras off.
[00:54:48.076 --> 00:54:49.538]  We have video of this.
[00:54:49.538 --> 00:54:51.560]  I just heard the ICE agent.
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:53.762]  They came across the street.
[00:54:53.762 --> 00:54:56.545]  Well, is it government or private prison property?
[00:54:56.545 --> 00:54:57.907]  We're telling them to turn their cameras off.
[00:54:57.907 --> 00:54:59.849]  Of course, we didn't turn our cameras off.
[00:55:01.952 --> 00:55:02.933]  It's a Catch-22.
[00:55:02.933 --> 00:55:05.635]  I would be out there with them right now, but then we couldn't do this live on air.
[00:55:05.635 --> 00:55:10.619]  And it has the added, we like to do this when we're on air, so they won't try anything on our people.
[00:55:10.619 --> 00:55:13.541]  There have been several protests out there the last few weeks.
[00:55:13.541 --> 00:55:16.643]  Counterpunch reported there was scheduled to be one today, but no one was out there.
[00:55:16.643 --> 00:55:21.667]  We've seen video and photos of big protests by big, 50-60 people out there in the last few weeks.
[00:55:21.667 --> 00:55:24.529]  For those who don't know, it's a Homeland Security grant, $368 million.
[00:55:27.739 --> 00:55:29.340]  to build FEMA camps in the U.S.
[00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:31.842]  for illegal aliens and U.S.
[00:55:31.842 --> 00:55:33.423]  citizens in times of emergency.
[00:55:46.545 --> 00:55:48.766]  And strip them of citizenship instantaneously.
[00:55:48.766 --> 00:55:59.330]  And under the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 07, now law, the President is in control of the entire country under official martial law.
[00:55:59.330 --> 00:56:05.972]  And can abolish all the governors and put any national or state guard under their control to deal with insurrection or U.S.
[00:56:05.972 --> 00:56:06.593]  citizens.
[00:56:06.593 --> 00:56:07.773]  And it lists it all.
[00:56:07.773 --> 00:56:08.894]  You've got to go read it for yourself.
[00:56:08.894 --> 00:56:11.695]  We've read it here on air.
[00:56:11.695 --> 00:56:15.116]  And they have, other than Mexicans, as they call them,
[00:56:16.724 --> 00:56:20.228]  At this facility, they have a playground for the children one hour a day.
[00:56:20.228 --> 00:56:22.510]  They split the men, women, and children up.
[00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:28.016]  And we told you they would have a few shows for the public of putting illegal aliens in these.
[00:56:28.016 --> 00:56:31.079]  And they don't get due process, which is wrong.
[00:56:31.079 --> 00:56:34.723]  And just holding them there instead of shipping them back to their country of origin, which is what should happen.
[00:56:35.926 --> 00:56:46.012]  And then it'll cause a bunch of grief and upsetness, and then the buildings are set up and built for citizens, but then the majority of the public is sold because, oh, it's just for the Jews.
[00:56:46.012 --> 00:56:48.413]  It's just for the Communists, just like Nazi Germany.
[00:56:48.413 --> 00:56:51.535]  Kevin Smith, joining us from Taylor, Texas, north of Austin.
[00:56:51.535 --> 00:56:54.537]  Kevin, fill us in on what happened to you.
[00:56:54.537 --> 00:56:57.078]  Well, we got here to cover this supposed protest.
[00:56:57.078 --> 00:57:03.822]  We don't see any hide or hair of the protest, but the correctional facility was pretty quick to respond to us pulling up.
[00:57:04.384 --> 00:57:15.852]  And as you were doing the intro, we had another officer come across and get our information, who we were with, and she just took that information and walked right back into the facility, so I guess they're gonna go run some checks right now.
[00:57:15.852 --> 00:57:18.754]  So while I was just talking for two minutes, they're already on you?
[00:57:18.754 --> 00:57:19.875]  Yeah, they came back across.
[00:57:19.875 --> 00:57:27.641]  Now, we are off their property now, we are back across the street filming the facility, but we did have Mr. Parker come out and he did confirm
[00:57:28.092 --> 00:57:30.093]  This is a private corporation.
[00:57:30.093 --> 00:57:32.375]  The thrust of this facility is immigration.
[00:57:32.375 --> 00:57:33.416]  Now, let's be clear.
[00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:42.061]  Greg Pallas, two months ago, in Louisiana, filmed one of these by the mobile plant, and they issued a warrant for his arrest in violation of infrastructure security.
[00:57:42.061 --> 00:57:44.763]  This is pretty dangerous what you guys are doing right now.
[00:57:44.763 --> 00:57:45.944]  Well, they're going in there.
[00:57:45.944 --> 00:57:51.368]  They're circling the wagons right now and trying to figure something out, but we just had an ICE agent drive by.
[00:57:51.368 --> 00:57:54.650]  So, again, this is a private-public partnership.
[00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:57.772]  So, all these vans in the parking lot say Homeland Security.
[00:57:58.508 --> 00:58:04.493]  And, but it is a private corporation, CCI, and it is only for immigration here.
[00:58:04.493 --> 00:58:09.878]  We haven't gone around the backside and seen the playground yet, but we'll do that before we leave.
[00:58:09.878 --> 00:58:18.406]  But, brand new facility, very modern, government plates on the vehicles that say Homeland Security on them.
[00:58:18.406 --> 00:58:21.528]  So, I don't know what, just what do you need from me right now, Alex?
[00:58:21.528 --> 00:58:22.489]  I don't know what else to tell you.
[00:58:22.489 --> 00:58:24.251]  We're just waiting on the cops probably at this point.
[00:58:26.005 --> 00:58:27.366]  I want you to do this.
[00:58:27.366 --> 00:58:43.055]  I want you to get in the car and I want you to go around off property and get footage of the playground of the FEMA buildings and then I want you to go back to the front and I want listeners in Taylor, we've got a lot of them, to go out of the facility.
[00:58:43.055 --> 00:58:47.618]  Give folks the exact location for people that want to support you as observers.
[00:58:48.564 --> 00:58:54.745]  This is right off of 79 and 95 in downtown Taylor.
[00:58:54.745 --> 00:58:57.126]  It's on 1001 Well Street.
[00:58:57.126 --> 00:59:00.766]  And if you know something about Taylor, it's a big rail freight city.
[00:59:00.766 --> 00:59:04.687]  So right at the front door of this facility is a major rail freight yard.
[00:59:04.687 --> 00:59:08.688]  Now, I just heard them telling you to turn the camera off five minutes ago during the break.
[00:59:08.688 --> 00:59:10.208]  Actually, stay where you're at.
[00:59:10.208 --> 00:59:14.769]  Let's see if we can smoke them out of their holes, get them to come up and violate the First Amendment right in front of everybody.
[00:59:15.825 --> 00:59:26.093]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:59:26.093 --> 00:59:31.216]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:59:31.216 --> 00:59:38.682]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:59:38.682 --> 00:59:42.605]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria.
[00:59:42.805 --> 00:59:43.385]  We're good to go!
[01:00:12.785 --> 01:00:13.826]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:13.826 --> 01:00:15.146]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:38.192 --> 01:00:39.493]  Big Brother.
[01:00:39.493 --> 01:00:41.254]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:41.254 --> 01:00:43.016]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:43.016 --> 01:00:44.597]  You want answers?
[01:00:44.597 --> 01:00:46.158]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:46.158 --> 01:00:50.342]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:50.342 --> 01:00:57.308]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:57.308 --> 01:01:02.852]  The Associated Press, the Austin American-Statesman, the LA Times, the Counterpunch, as well as Infowars.com,
[01:01:04.059 --> 01:01:13.588]  Have all reported on the Taylor Don Huddo Concentration Camp in Taylor, Texas.
[01:01:14.446 --> 01:01:22.374]  Where they are holding people, they're not allowed to see their lawyers, they're not allowed due process, they're other than Mexicans, supposed people on immigration violations.
[01:01:22.374 --> 01:01:25.737]  They're holding children, whole families, they're not giving them due process.
[01:01:25.737 --> 01:01:29.981]  But these camps were built, and admittedly built, for illegal aliens and U.S.
[01:01:29.981 --> 01:01:30.862]  citizens.
[01:01:30.862 --> 01:01:33.404]  They're FEMA run on private installations.
[01:01:33.404 --> 01:01:34.945]  Texas admittedly has two of these.
[01:01:34.945 --> 01:01:39.550]  Greg Pallast, American of the BBC, was doing a story for ABC Nightly News,
[01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:40.651]  We're good to go.
[01:02:01.505 --> 01:02:03.447]  North of Austin in Taylor, Texas.
[01:02:03.447 --> 01:02:08.491]  Kevin Smith, relay to listeners exactly what you're witnessing right now and exactly what they said to you.
[01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:11.133]  I heard some of it during the break 10 minutes ago.
[01:02:11.133 --> 01:02:13.636]  The break at 51 after.
[01:02:13.636 --> 01:02:15.197]  You were on the phone.
[01:02:15.197 --> 01:02:16.898]  I was listening while you were talking to them.
[01:02:16.898 --> 01:02:19.581]  Too bad that we weren't on air when that happened.
[01:02:19.581 --> 01:02:22.743]  But recap what you witnessed.
[01:02:22.743 --> 01:02:28.068]  Well I think what you heard was actually the ICE agent that came up in a white panel van
[01:02:28.718 --> 01:02:36.323]  And he said, you know, turn that off, get that out of my face, and Aaron basically just dropped the camera down, but he didn't turn it off, so it kept rolling.
[01:02:36.323 --> 01:02:39.626]  They come getting your face in America.
[01:02:39.626 --> 01:02:40.766]  We're on the street, too.
[01:02:40.766 --> 01:02:41.007]  Yeah.
[01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:41.967]  We weren't on the property.
[01:02:41.967 --> 01:02:53.515]  That's right, and that's what, I mean, it's just like in Road to Tyranny, when I have regular Army walk up in Belton, Texas, and say, turn our cameras off, and I told them to take a hike.
[01:02:53.515 --> 01:02:56.037]  Well, while I was talking to you, also, one of the
[01:02:57.122 --> 01:02:59.684]  Guards came right back up to me and took our information.
[01:02:59.684 --> 01:03:01.365]  Wanted to know again who we were with.
[01:03:01.365 --> 01:03:04.667]  They wrote it down on a pad and they went back inside and they haven't come back out since then.
[01:03:04.667 --> 01:03:06.528]  But you know, that's not even their jurisdiction.
[01:03:06.528 --> 01:03:09.069]  They're not allowed to come out off their property and ask.
[01:03:09.069 --> 01:03:11.211]  In fact, I don't even know if you should tell them anything, Kevin.
[01:03:11.211 --> 01:03:13.432]  Just say you're national media.
[01:03:13.432 --> 01:03:14.993]  You know, I always kind of operate.
[01:03:14.993 --> 01:03:16.113]  We're not doing anything wrong.
[01:03:16.113 --> 01:03:17.094]  We operate in the light of day.
[01:03:17.094 --> 01:03:18.355]  No, I understand that, Kevin.
[01:03:18.355 --> 01:03:19.135]  I understand that.
[01:03:19.135 --> 01:03:20.116]  I understand that, but just...
[01:03:20.936 --> 01:03:22.917]  Well, let me tell you about this place.
[01:03:22.917 --> 01:03:28.219]  Of course, we've got the flags that have masks for Gerald Ford, but this is a brand new facility.
[01:03:28.219 --> 01:03:35.261]  The barbed wire is facing, and the Constantino wire is facing in, I'd say, you know, 12, 15 foot fence around it.
[01:03:35.261 --> 01:03:42.444]  There seems to be a detached, it looks like a solitary confinement box that we're looking at right now.
[01:03:42.444 --> 01:03:45.065]  You know, of course, the double gates to let you in.
[01:03:46.145 --> 01:03:50.126]  Uh, there seems to be a greenhouse in the background, but we'll go around the side of the building and look.
[01:03:50.126 --> 01:03:57.888]  But there are these massive, long, custom vans that, uh, I don't know how to really describe them.
[01:03:57.888 --> 01:04:02.490]  They're almost, they cross between like a large shuttle bus and a small 18-wheeler.
[01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:04.630]  And we'll get some footage of that for you guys, too.
[01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:09.012]  But, uh, lots of brand new equipment here, uh, no doubt about it.
[01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:12.933]  And, uh, they seem to be, uh, big employers around here right now.
[01:04:12.933 --> 01:04:13.333]  We've seen a
[01:04:14.110 --> 01:04:18.998]  A constant stream of contractors, plumbers, electricians coming in and out of the building.
[01:04:19.545 --> 01:04:28.247]  Right now, and there was some question that we were filming people's faces earlier, and that may not be allowed, and they may want to review what we've seen, but that's... Excuse me!
[01:04:28.247 --> 01:04:29.327]  That's not going to happen.
[01:04:29.327 --> 01:04:30.708]  Hey, Kevin, let me just give you a news flash.
[01:04:30.708 --> 01:04:32.228]  You work for me.
[01:04:32.228 --> 01:04:41.270]  You're there, this is the United States, and they're telling you you're not allowed to... Oh, they're secret agents at the FEMA camp, and you're not supposed to... See, folks?
[01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.530]  See?
[01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:42.810]  I mean, this illustrates everything.
[01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:45.431]  I want you to get in the car right now, Kevin,
[01:04:45.951 --> 01:04:52.054]  And I want you to go around and get footage at the back and show that playground we've already got photos of for the children.
[01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:59.618]  And then I want you to get away from that location and then prepare for further orders after that off air, okay?
[01:04:59.618 --> 01:05:00.278]  You got it!
[01:05:00.278 --> 01:05:02.339]  I want you to get in the car right now.
[01:05:02.339 --> 01:05:07.542]  I'm not going to let those goons get my $6,000 and $5,000 cameras.
[01:05:07.542 --> 01:05:10.924]  We've already had trips before at Gunpoint one time in San Antonio.
[01:05:10.924 --> 01:05:13.065]  Take our camera, take our footage of Delta Force.
[01:05:14.167 --> 01:05:17.508]  It's nothing like having a big M.P.
[01:05:17.508 --> 01:05:18.329]  Black M.P.
[01:05:18.329 --> 01:05:19.209]  pointed gun at you.
[01:05:19.209 --> 01:05:20.550]  Mike Hanson got to enjoy that.
[01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:23.031]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:05:23.031 --> 01:05:25.431]  Kevin, stay on your cell phone.
[01:05:25.431 --> 01:05:27.472]  And I want you to get into the car right now.
[01:05:27.472 --> 01:05:29.573]  And I want you to move out of there.
[01:05:29.573 --> 01:05:31.374]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:05:31.374 --> 01:05:31.774]  Stay with us.
[01:05:36.926 --> 01:05:42.750]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:50.395]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:51.078 --> 01:05:58.522]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:58.522 --> 01:06:10.267]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:06:10.267 --> 01:06:14.229]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:06:14.229 --> 01:06:16.490]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:20.332]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:42.013]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:06:42.013 --> 01:06:46.655]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:06:46.655 --> 01:06:55.778]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:06:55.778 --> 01:06:59.379]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:06:59.679 --> 01:07:05.005]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:07:05.005 --> 01:07:11.712]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:07:12.225 --> 01:07:13.526]  What about you?
[01:07:13.526 --> 01:07:18.931]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:07:35.276 --> 01:07:39.640]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.662]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:07:41.662 --> 01:07:48.228]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:07:48.228 --> 01:07:54.613]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:07:54.613 --> 01:08:00.639]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:08:00.919 --> 01:08:02.401]  With no side effects.
[01:08:02.401 --> 01:08:07.467]  The 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:08:07.467 --> 01:08:11.312]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:08:11.312 --> 01:08:15.217]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:08:15.217 --> 01:08:17.881]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:08:17.881 --> 01:08:18.942]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:08:19.202 --> 01:08:25.024]  Alright, the national media admits that there is a Homeland Security private FEMA camp just north of Austin in Taylor, Texas.
[01:08:51.147 --> 01:08:53.750]  This is in the metro area of Austin.
[01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:59.938]  I've got Aaron Dykes on camera and Kevin Smith reporting from the location.
[01:08:59.938 --> 01:09:02.762]  He's told me a lot more off-air.
[01:09:02.762 --> 01:09:06.867]  They've been told by three separate groups to turn their cameras off.
[01:09:06.867 --> 01:09:09.831]  This is off their property, off the prison property, on private property.
[01:09:12.455 --> 01:09:13.595]  Across the street.
[01:09:13.595 --> 01:09:19.698]  They've also heard loud discussions, which we got on tape, saying that they may try to get our tapes and review them.
[01:09:19.698 --> 01:09:22.439]  And this is the U.S., you understand?
[01:09:22.439 --> 01:09:26.540]  We'll videotape what we want to out there at your little FEMA camp.
[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:30.621]  I've been outside prisons before and had them say, you know, turn your camera off, get out of here.
[01:09:30.621 --> 01:09:33.102]  Because they're used to shoving prisoners around.
[01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:37.844]  Now, in the new America, everybody's a prisoner, and so, you know, these jail guards get to have their fun with people.
[01:09:38.952 --> 01:09:49.099]  Uh, but I want you to know, national TV's been out there, the state's one's been out there, everybody's been out there, and if you discriminate against us, I will sue you.
[01:09:49.099 --> 01:09:53.302]  And you may, uh, beat the rap, but you're not gonna beat the ride.
[01:09:53.302 --> 01:09:55.244]  I mean, I will nuisance lawsuit people.
[01:09:55.244 --> 01:09:57.065]  I don't care about money.
[01:09:57.065 --> 01:09:58.546]  You see, that's what's dangerous about us.
[01:09:58.546 --> 01:10:00.847]  We'll just sue you.
[01:10:00.847 --> 01:10:07.312]  Kinda like we sued, uh, the city, and their operatives here, and one of them just was convicted and sent to prison for fraud.
[01:10:08.306 --> 01:10:16.394]  We sued them for something else but we knew fraud was going on and in the disclosures and in the fleshing them out people went to jail.
[01:10:16.394 --> 01:10:18.336]  Others are on their way to jail.
[01:10:18.336 --> 01:10:21.159]  So just don't violate my rights and don't try it.
[01:10:21.159 --> 01:10:28.506]  And don't you dare do anything to my employees or I'll sue you and your company seven ways to Sunday.
[01:10:28.506 --> 01:10:29.748]  You understand?
[01:10:29.748 --> 01:10:32.090]  You twits up there running that FEMA camp
[01:10:33.081 --> 01:10:36.503]  Want to try to razz my people and get their cameras taken?
[01:10:36.503 --> 01:10:45.069]  You call the Taylor PD, and you have them go out there, and you have the Taylor PD, that probably knows more about the Constitution, try to trump something up.
[01:10:45.069 --> 01:10:52.934]  And if they violate any of our constitutional rights, that our forefathers fought and died for, I'll sue them into oblivion.
[01:10:52.934 --> 01:10:55.536]  You understand?
[01:10:55.536 --> 01:10:58.478]  I'll go drop ten, twenty, thirty thousand dollars on it.
[01:10:58.478 --> 01:11:00.419]  I'll get mean lawyers.
[01:11:00.419 --> 01:11:01.560]  That's what we do.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:02.561]  Don't mess with us.
[01:11:03.743 --> 01:11:10.327]  Trying to get the news for the people, you punks!
[01:11:10.327 --> 01:11:13.709]  Kevin's going to be calling in from another location around the FEMA camp.
[01:11:13.709 --> 01:11:19.892]  And again, as the Houston Chronicle reported, as Rex 84 ought to get that queued up.
[01:11:19.892 --> 01:11:21.994]  But two of my people are gone that will be doing that here at the office.
[01:11:21.994 --> 01:11:24.095]  It's in my film, The Takeover.
[01:11:24.095 --> 01:11:31.219]  It's in my film, America's Shored by Design, the Senate Hearings, where they admit FEMA camps.
[01:11:31.219 --> 01:11:32.840]  FEMA camps.
[01:11:34.269 --> 01:11:39.192]  That they would first sell it in the name of putting illegal aliens in them, but they would also put U.S.
[01:11:39.192 --> 01:11:40.473]  citizens in them.
[01:11:40.473 --> 01:11:46.317]  And now the Houston Chronicle reported last year that's exactly what they're doing.
[01:11:46.317 --> 01:11:48.178]  And they're putting other than Mexicans in there.
[01:11:48.178 --> 01:11:56.263]  They've got people in there, and the descriptions of it, the children separated from their parents in one area, the women in another, the men in another.
[01:11:56.263 --> 01:11:58.765]  Well, you saw the Marines trying to do it in my film, Police Day 2000.
[01:12:02.102 --> 01:12:13.411]  We've gone from 1.3 million in the prison system a decade ago to over 7 million in the system, 4 million plus behind bars.
[01:12:13.411 --> 01:12:14.972]  And, you know, you gotta love it.
[01:12:14.972 --> 01:12:21.677]  The government, the federal government is putting in emergency command centers everywhere, tracking our cell phones, face scanning cameras everywhere.
[01:12:21.677 --> 01:12:24.239]  Many towns run every plate that drives through their town.
[01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:27.081]  They got cameras on us, but they don't want cameras on them.
[01:12:28.012 --> 01:12:29.693]  Hey, it's called the First Amendment.
[01:12:29.693 --> 01:12:31.073]  What's it going to be next?
[01:12:31.073 --> 01:12:32.373]  They've got free speech zones now.
[01:12:32.373 --> 01:12:35.674]  Will it be First Amendment zones for news gathering?
[01:12:35.674 --> 01:12:39.476]  I've had so many police over the years march up and tell me to turn cameras off.
[01:12:39.476 --> 01:12:47.378]  And if you're not up, involved, disrupting what they're doing, I mean, you'll be 50 yards away on a highway overpass, on a sidewalk, videotaping them at a checkpoint.
[01:12:47.378 --> 01:12:49.199]  They'll run over and say, turn your cameras off.
[01:12:49.199 --> 01:12:49.979]  Well, you've seen the footage.
[01:12:49.979 --> 01:12:51.320]  And I say, no!
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:52.420]  First Amendment.
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:53.460]  Well, I'm going to arrest you.
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:54.180]  You go ahead.
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:55.001]  I want your name.
[01:12:55.001 --> 01:12:55.761]  I'm going to sue you.
[01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:59.490]  And they know when you're telling the truth.
[01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:01.672]  This is all at an animal instinct level, folks.
[01:13:01.672 --> 01:13:03.553]  They know I'm telling the truth.
[01:13:03.553 --> 01:13:05.154]  They know I mean it.
[01:13:05.154 --> 01:13:08.116]  I mean what I say.
[01:13:08.116 --> 01:13:10.858]  And I said what I meant.
[01:13:10.858 --> 01:13:15.442]  An elephant's faithful 100%.
[01:13:15.442 --> 01:13:17.783]  Little line from Horton.
[01:13:17.783 --> 01:13:20.845]  Had a... egg or whatever the story is.
[01:13:20.845 --> 01:13:21.766]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up.
[01:13:21.766 --> 01:13:22.707]  I'm really mad right now.
[01:13:23.829 --> 01:13:30.011]  Meanwhile, on the heels of this, half of our infantry by the end of this decade will be illegal alien foreigners.
[01:13:30.011 --> 01:13:31.891]  Michael Rivero joining us from Hawaii.
[01:13:31.891 --> 01:13:35.492]  He'll be starting his own talk show here soon on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:13:35.492 --> 01:13:39.213]  Michael, I'll tell you, every time you're on the show, it's some huge news day.
[01:13:39.213 --> 01:13:40.294]  How you doing?
[01:13:40.294 --> 01:13:45.615]  Well, I don't think it has anything to do with me, but man, my phone is smoking from listening to you.
[01:13:45.615 --> 01:13:48.896]  You've got me convinced that I'm not going to mess with Texas here.
[01:13:50.552 --> 01:13:54.414]  I know you've been covering the FEMA camps and how they built them and what they're doing.
[01:13:54.414 --> 01:13:55.734]  You want to comment on it?
[01:13:55.734 --> 01:13:57.915]  Yeah, this has been going on for a lot of years.
[01:13:57.915 --> 01:14:08.598]  We've seen maps of these camps that are being set up, whether they're called detention centers or transition points or the various euphemisms that are used to sort of conceal what they are.
[01:14:08.598 --> 01:14:11.739]  But functionally, what they are, they are concentration camps.
[01:14:11.739 --> 01:14:13.080]  They are large areas where
[01:14:13.636 --> 01:14:18.197]  Uh, that are designed to hold large numbers of people, uh, and keep them under control.
[01:14:18.197 --> 01:14:32.080]  Uh, they don't even come up to the standards, uh, that are set supposedly for civilian prisons, but they are located strategically all across the United States at various, uh, uh, uh, rail transit, uh, points, uh, where various railroads come together.
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:33.580]  You will usually find one.
[01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:34.960]  That's what Kevin was just saying.
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:37.641]  There's a huge railroad going right into the camp.
[01:14:37.641 --> 01:14:38.541]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:40.846 --> 01:14:46.508]  Railroad is still the most efficient way to transport large masses of people on land.
[01:14:46.508 --> 01:14:50.650]  So yes, anytime anybody has built any concentration camps, Germany did exactly the same.
[01:14:50.650 --> 01:14:58.174]  They were always located near major rail centers, they always had their own railroad sidings that went right into the camps.
[01:14:58.174 --> 01:15:05.818]  And yes, it is very clearly set up for mass detentions, and clearly plans are being laid
[01:15:06.437 --> 01:15:17.850]  For the government, if it feels it necessary to simply arrest large numbers of people, throw them in these camps without warrant, without judicial review... Well, that's word for word, Michael Rivera of whatreallyhappened.com.
[01:15:17.850 --> 01:15:25.298]  That's word for word in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 that, frankly, is even worse than the Military Commissions Act.
[01:15:25.894 --> 01:15:31.219]  Yeah, and the wording actually goes back to a lot of what are so-called the FEMA executive orders.
[01:15:31.219 --> 01:15:38.826]  Some of these go back actually to Nixon's administration and Gerald Ford, who has just, you know, being buried as we speak.
[01:15:38.826 --> 01:15:51.018]  But basically, it is a wartime declaration of being able to simply grab people and get them out of the way during any period that the government can declare a national emergency of some kind.
[01:15:51.773 --> 01:15:53.774]  And clearly as we see the U.S.
[01:15:53.774 --> 01:16:04.959]  government continuing to move towards another war in Iran against the very obvious will of the American people, somewhere down the road there is going to be a crisis of some kind and clearly the U.S.
[01:16:04.959 --> 01:16:06.600]  government is preparing
[01:16:07.017 --> 01:16:14.643]  To simply come down very hard on the American people at the point where the American people no longer want to follow along with what the government is doing.
[01:16:14.643 --> 01:16:20.748]  Well, they have been gearing the entire society for crisis response, building FEMA centers in every major city.
[01:16:20.748 --> 01:16:25.872]  In 99, we went and videotaped, before it was even on local Fox News, we put it in my film, The Takeover, when they reported on it.
[01:16:26.614 --> 01:16:40.083]  Uh, that they took a 747 hanger, put bolts and chains in the floor, barbed wire fences inside, porta-potties in areas for men, women, and children, and then we went out and interviewed the guards and the people, and they said, yeah, it's some secret camp, and then Fox had to respond to me.
[01:16:40.083 --> 01:16:41.544]  Again, it's in my film, Takeover, folks.
[01:16:41.544 --> 01:16:43.105]  You can watch it for free on Google Video.
[01:16:43.105 --> 01:16:45.046]  Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:16:45.046 --> 01:16:45.687]  The Takeover.
[01:16:46.167 --> 01:16:50.612]  We'll get it in the DVD box that we're now selling of all three of my Police Day classics.
[01:16:50.612 --> 01:16:58.220]  And they said it's for during emergencies, overflow during riots, riots in Austin, building secret facilities.
[01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:01.504]  And then we looked at the RNC run by Bechtel, George Shultz.
[01:17:02.844 --> 01:17:12.568]  2004, a huge 1930s bus terminal, Pier 57, over 2,000 people held at one time, barbed wire fences, bolts and chains, exact same M.O.
[01:17:12.568 --> 01:17:16.149]  They have these in every, even mid-sized cities, like Austin.
[01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:18.310]  They're not playing games!
[01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:30.674]  No, they absolutely aren't, and along with these very obvious concentration camps, prison facilities, mass detention facilities, as you mentioned earlier, they're also building all these underground command posts
[01:17:31.488 --> 01:17:38.431]  And I remember when I was still living in Los Angeles, we saw one that was built underneath Griffith Park in the middle of Los Angeles.
[01:17:38.431 --> 01:17:41.172]  We saw the construction going on.
[01:17:41.172 --> 01:17:44.774]  My wife is involved in the architectural industry, or was back then before we started.
[01:17:44.774 --> 01:17:50.676]  And now they've announced these fusion centers are federal control arms with CIA and FBI agents over the local community.
[01:17:51.817 --> 01:17:57.700]  Absolutely, but the really intense thing are these underground facilities that they're building.
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:59.200]  They're impossible to get to.
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.701]  They're very expensive.
[01:18:00.701 --> 01:18:04.743]  My wife and I went through the Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles, and when FEMA came in there,
[01:18:05.194 --> 01:18:08.337]  Very little money was actually handed out to any of the earthquake victims.
[01:18:08.337 --> 01:18:12.500]  Most of it was all spent to build this new underground emergency command post.
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.702]  Same thing with the $200 billion for Katrina.
[01:18:14.702 --> 01:18:20.447]  That's why they let these disasters get as bad as possible to get more funds, and then that's used on the control infrastructure.
[01:18:20.447 --> 01:18:21.668]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:18:21.668 --> 01:18:34.078]  And we even have one here on the island of Oahu on the H3 freeway, which was this multi-billion dollar road to connect the Kaneohe Marine Base with the Center Island military bases.
[01:18:34.611 --> 01:18:40.899]  And it has this tunnel complex in the middle of it, which, if you look at it, it's very obvious there's a lot more than just tunnels involved there.
[01:18:40.899 --> 01:18:49.048]  So, uh, there's, uh, there's, uh, all these, uh, driveways that go inside the mountains, and all of these windows that peek out, and it's, it really does look like a fortress.
[01:18:49.048 --> 01:18:50.210]  I should send you a picture of that.
[01:18:51.618 --> 01:18:55.741]  And of course, we have Giuliani's little command bunker in Building 7 on 9-11.
[01:18:55.741 --> 01:18:56.742]  Well, there's no debating it.
[01:18:56.742 --> 01:19:04.267]  I mean, the executive order said they can put us all in forced labor camps, use us as slave labor, break up our families.
[01:19:04.267 --> 01:19:09.270]  I don't know if you've ever seen Police State 2000, Mike, but I mean, I have the Marines admitting it's for the U.S.
[01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:13.033]  and admitting they're training to break up our families and take our guns and put us in camps.
[01:19:13.033 --> 01:19:14.274]  Then I have Thomas Sanchez
[01:19:14.674 --> 01:19:30.468]  Emergency management had a highly decorated Vietnam veteran, the head of Kingsville's emergency management, and they called him in and said we're going to do drills for gun confiscation and takeover of the government, and he said hell no and came on my radio show, and he even went on national TV and exposed it back in 99.
[01:19:30.468 --> 01:19:32.409]  I mean, this has been going on a while.
[01:19:32.409 --> 01:19:33.370]  Yes, it has.
[01:19:33.370 --> 01:19:40.096]  Back in the mid-90s, there was a test called the Combat Arms Survey administered to the Marine Corps, who are exempt from posse comitatus.
[01:19:40.755 --> 01:19:46.457]  And it basically came down to, would you be willing to shoot Americans who refused gun confiscation?
[01:19:46.457 --> 01:20:00.981]  And it was a bit of a scandal at the time, but it underscores that this planning to transform the United States into a totally disarmed population of subservient subjects, or tenants, has really been going on for quite a long time now.
[01:20:00.981 --> 01:20:08.443]  But now they're hot and heavy building these things like mushrooms after a big rain, because they know they're getting ready to implode the economy, launch more wars.
[01:20:09.772 --> 01:20:19.794]  Absolutely, and clearly we're seeing the buildup towards an invasion of Iran and the lesson of the midterm election and the will of the people is clearly not a factor in the plan.
[01:20:19.794 --> 01:20:22.535]  Mike Rivera, I want to talk about your new show that starts this weekend.
[01:20:22.535 --> 01:20:25.195]  I also want to get another update from Kevin.
[01:20:25.195 --> 01:20:27.696]  Every time we get off the phone with him, they come up to him again.
[01:20:27.696 --> 01:20:28.796]  They're at the FEMA camp.
[01:20:28.796 --> 01:20:29.956]  We'll check in with him as well.
[01:20:29.956 --> 01:20:30.336]  Stay with us.
[01:20:39.315 --> 01:20:40.876]  Currency devaluation.
[01:20:40.876 --> 01:20:41.897]  Inflation.
[01:20:41.897 --> 01:20:43.318]  One and the same.
[01:20:43.318 --> 01:20:47.321]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:20:47.321 --> 01:20:49.403]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:20:49.403 --> 01:20:49.943]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:20:49.943 --> 01:20:51.724]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:20:51.724 --> 01:20:52.305]  Here is reality.
[01:20:52.305 --> 01:20:54.366]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:21:09.082 --> 01:21:13.303]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:21:13.303 --> 01:21:17.484]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[01:21:17.484 --> 01:21:21.546]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:35.761]  Good morning, honey.
[01:21:35.761 --> 01:21:42.024]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation.
[01:21:42.024 --> 01:21:43.025]  Yeah.
[01:21:43.025 --> 01:21:44.806]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[01:21:44.806 --> 01:21:48.668]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[01:21:48.668 --> 01:21:50.629]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:52.710]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[01:21:52.710 --> 01:21:54.451]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[01:21:54.651 --> 01:21:55.952]  Honey, cheer up!

[01:21:58.473 --> 01:21:59.213]  What?

[01:22:09.978 --> 01:22:14.820]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?

[01:22:33.719 --> 01:22:36.901]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:36.901 --> 01:22:39.823]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts No.
[01:22:39.823 --> 01:22:46.468]  1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[01:22:46.468 --> 01:22:52.472]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[01:22:52.472 --> 01:22:54.673]  This is minimum infringement.
[01:22:54.673 --> 01:22:55.454]  There may be more.
[01:22:56.639 --> 01:23:04.123]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?
[01:23:04.123 --> 01:23:12.807]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:23:33.618 --> 01:23:35.360]  Shelly, you look exhausted.
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:36.200]  What's wrong?
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:37.521]  I am so tired.
[01:23:37.521 --> 01:23:40.124]  I just get so hot at night and can't sleep.
[01:23:40.124 --> 01:23:41.265]  I have tried everything.
[01:23:41.265 --> 01:23:43.186]  All kinds of fans, sheets, pillows.
[01:23:43.186 --> 01:23:44.468]  You name it, I've tried it.
[01:23:44.468 --> 01:23:46.910]  My husband has always been a hot sleeper.
[01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:48.711]  He's never had a good night's sleep.
[01:23:48.711 --> 01:23:50.873]  Then we discovered something that really helped.
[01:23:50.873 --> 01:23:53.295]  It's called the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[01:23:53.295 --> 01:23:53.756]  The what?

[01:24:03.902 --> 01:24:05.243]  How well are you sleeping?

[01:24:07.285 --> 01:24:11.848]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.

[01:24:19.993 --> 01:24:21.553]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[01:24:21.553 --> 01:24:24.715]  Or are you looking for the perfect gift for that person who has everything?
[01:24:24.715 --> 01:24:26.275]  The BedFan is the answer.
[01:24:26.275 --> 01:24:27.896]  Visit BedFan.com.
[01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:34.539]  That's Bed F A N dot com.
[01:24:34.539 --> 01:24:38.981]  Body Union is our big business plan.
[01:24:38.981 --> 01:24:44.384]  And it's going down like a dinosaur.
[01:24:44.384 --> 01:24:46.445]  Body is the gold foot in Kansas.
[01:24:47.626 --> 01:24:48.487]  Welcome back.
[01:24:48.487 --> 01:24:50.849]  Hey, is it tough enough for you?
[01:24:50.849 --> 01:24:54.332]  We got our people out there covering the FEMA camp.
[01:24:54.332 --> 01:24:58.215]  Goom's telling them to turn their cameras off repeatedly.
[01:24:58.215 --> 01:25:00.337]  Van's driving up to them.
[01:25:13.405 --> 01:25:18.946]  We need folks to converge up there that are in the Taylor area, North Austin, Round Rock area.
[01:25:18.946 --> 01:25:21.707]  We need everybody to converge up there at the front.
[01:25:21.707 --> 01:25:22.807]  They're at the back right now.
[01:25:22.807 --> 01:25:24.867]  Kevin, give us a recap of what's happened.
[01:25:24.867 --> 01:25:30.408]  Some of the new developments and the call for people to come out there as observers of the press covering this FEMA camp.
[01:25:30.408 --> 01:25:32.608]  Then we'll go back to Michael Rivero.
[01:25:32.608 --> 01:25:40.390]  Yeah, you know Alex, we came out here to cover an event and apparently it looked like it was sort of a leftist event that was going to be scheduled and they're nowhere to be found.
[01:25:41.623 --> 01:25:44.285]  From what we've heard of the people, there was no one there today.
[01:25:44.285 --> 01:25:46.466]  And I'm calling people that live in North Austin.
[01:25:46.466 --> 01:25:50.208]  It's about 15 miles east on 79 of Round Rock.
[01:25:50.208 --> 01:25:52.449]  You need to get out here and make a splash.
[01:25:52.449 --> 01:26:00.913]  This is a brand new, state-of-the-art detention center with railroad access, not 100 feet from the front door.
[01:26:00.913 --> 01:26:04.595]  And it's really creepy when you hear those train cars start to move around.
[01:26:04.595 --> 01:26:06.996]  You think, this is just going to be a processing center.
[01:26:06.996 --> 01:26:08.117]  It's really not large enough.
[01:26:08.607 --> 01:26:15.253]  To hold mass volumes of people, so they're going to do central processing here and put you on a freight train out west is what I think.
[01:26:15.253 --> 01:26:22.740]  And it's admitted, it's admitted that it's for domestic control and they're just kicking it off with the illegals who deserve to process themselves.
[01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:26.383]  There's a big report in the Statesman how that hasn't been happening.
[01:26:26.383 --> 01:26:28.385]  Give people the address, Kevin.
[01:26:28.385 --> 01:26:32.828]  It's 1001 Welsh, but the thing is this is right in the middle of Taylor, Texas.
[01:26:32.828 --> 01:26:35.551]  I'm standing on a residential street right now, Doak Street.
[01:26:36.129 --> 01:26:41.132]  You're going to go on to 95, head south, and you are going to stay on the frontage.
[01:26:41.132 --> 01:26:49.977]  Don't get on the overpass, and take a right on West Oak, and then you will come to a T-intersection, and that is Doak Street, and you will see the facility right there.
[01:26:49.977 --> 01:26:56.681]  There are, you know, intramural or like Optimist League baseball fields that circle this facility.
[01:26:56.681 --> 01:27:02.284]  It's a residential neighborhood on the right-hand side, and then a detainment facility on the left.
[01:27:03.248 --> 01:27:15.778]  You know, high wires, trucks patrolling the perimeter constantly, and again, that really creepy, scary mixture of public-private partnership, you know, neo-fascism.
[01:27:15.778 --> 01:27:25.245]  But I'll tell you what concerns me is that they would come off the property, across the street, and tell you to turn your cameras off, and that you heard discussion of them reviewing our tapes.
[01:27:25.245 --> 01:27:29.768]  Keep your hands off my equipment, keep your hands off my property.
[01:27:29.768 --> 01:27:32.991]  I tell you, these ICE officers make me sick.
[01:27:34.197 --> 01:27:35.638]  Let's bring Michael Rivero in here.
[01:27:35.638 --> 01:27:37.900]  Mike, you got any comments for Kevin Smith?
[01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:51.351]  Well, first of all, keep yourself safe and be careful because unfortunately you're dealing with individuals who are more than likely private contractors and they're not going to be as aware of the limits of the law as to what their actions can be.
[01:27:51.351 --> 01:27:58.897]  And I'd hate to see you provoke them to the point where they actually exceed their authority and either harm the equipment or harm you.
[01:27:58.897 --> 01:28:01.379]  And yes, we can sue them after the fact.
[01:28:01.966 --> 01:28:05.027]  But you've got to stay safe here.
[01:28:05.027 --> 01:28:12.149]  These are not individuals who are being taught to have any respect for the people, or they wouldn't be guards in a processing center in the first place.
[01:28:12.149 --> 01:28:13.309]  So just, you've got to be careful.
[01:28:13.309 --> 01:28:15.630]  This is a serious situation, obviously.
[01:28:15.630 --> 01:28:16.170]  Exactly.
[01:28:16.170 --> 01:28:21.211]  Kevin, where do you want folks, and there's already been a few protests out there, so it's safe as long as there's numbers.
[01:28:21.211 --> 01:28:24.452]  The problem is Kevin and Aaron Dykes are out there by themselves.
[01:28:24.452 --> 01:28:27.433]  Kevin, let's say I'm going up I-35 from Austin.
[01:28:27.433 --> 01:28:29.434]  Let's say I'm in North Austin.
[01:28:29.434 --> 01:28:30.494]  I'm going up I-35.
[01:28:30.494 --> 01:28:31.134]  How do I get to you?
[01:28:31.644 --> 01:28:37.145]  You're going to take the 79 exit in Round Rock, and you're going to head east on 79 toward Taylor, Texas.
[01:28:37.145 --> 01:28:45.687]  You're going to go past the Dell Diamond and all those places, and right when you get into downtown Taylor, you will see 95 that goes south.
[01:28:45.687 --> 01:28:48.188]  Do not get on the overpass that goes across the train yard.
[01:28:48.188 --> 01:28:51.108]  Stay on the frontage, and that will take you to Oak Street.
[01:28:51.108 --> 01:28:59.310]  You take a right, then you take another right on Doak, and then you are at the facility, and the front door of the CCI facility is against the train tracks.
[01:29:00.177 --> 01:29:01.538]  We really need support out here.
[01:29:01.538 --> 01:29:02.859]  It keeps us safe.
[01:29:02.859 --> 01:29:08.902]  Right now they seem to have backed off a little bit because we didn't cower in fear and we were firm and we said we have the right to be here.
[01:29:08.902 --> 01:29:16.306]  So, but we gave them our information and they went back inside like they've got some sneaky secret and I guess they're trying to figure out who we are right now.
[01:29:16.306 --> 01:29:22.610]  But I'm a little surprised that we haven't had local law enforcement come out, but so far it's good.
[01:29:22.610 --> 01:29:24.831]  Well that's because they know this is America.
[01:29:25.558 --> 01:29:26.559]  I hope so.
[01:29:26.559 --> 01:29:27.079]  I hope so.
[01:29:27.079 --> 01:29:33.542]  It'd actually make me feel a little more comfortable if we did get some Taylor PD in here, but please come out.
[01:29:33.542 --> 01:29:35.703]  We'll be here for another hour or two.
[01:29:35.703 --> 01:29:38.604]  If you're local, let's get over here and let's make a stink.
[01:29:38.604 --> 01:29:42.226]  And then we have the safety of the cameras, so they're not going to do anything while we're filming.
[01:29:43.058 --> 01:29:44.319]  Yeah, I'm Aaron.
[01:29:44.319 --> 01:29:45.440]  No, no, that's it.
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:52.545]  Kevin, just keep your cell phone on, be ready for a call the minute, because right before I talked to you, you said another van was driving up, then it drove away.
[01:29:52.545 --> 01:29:59.290]  Just call me the minute they drive up to you again, and go ahead and go back to the front so you can meet up with people as they get there.
[01:29:59.290 --> 01:30:00.131]  Mike Rivero, stay there.
[01:30:00.131 --> 01:30:05.875]  We're going to come back, get into the Democrats wanting to continue the war, Bush's new strategy,
[01:30:06.827 --> 01:30:09.088]  And a lot more on the other side.
[01:30:09.088 --> 01:30:14.490]  I'll also open the phones up to listeners at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:30:14.490 --> 01:30:15.511]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:15.511 --> 01:30:24.094]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:24.094 --> 01:30:25.475]  We're on the march.
[01:30:25.475 --> 01:30:27.996]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:27.996 --> 01:30:30.697]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:33.723 --> 01:30:37.989]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:30:37.989 --> 01:30:41.575]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:30:41.575 --> 01:30:45.020]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:30:45.299 --> 01:30:48.561]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:30:48.561 --> 01:30:54.064]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:30:54.064 --> 01:31:03.830]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:05.211]  It's a well thought out formula.
[01:31:05.211 --> 01:31:10.614]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:31:10.996 --> 01:31:15.618]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:31:15.618 --> 01:31:17.159]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:31:17.159 --> 01:31:20.640]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:21.621]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:35.321]  Ted Anderson for Midas, January 2nd, 2007.
[01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:04.280]  We're good to go.
[01:32:34.364 --> 01:32:35.505]  It's no secret.
[01:32:35.505 --> 01:32:41.169]  Aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable of causing DNA damage.
[01:32:41.169 --> 01:32:46.273]  Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects.
[01:32:46.273 --> 01:32:48.775]  So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[01:32:48.775 --> 01:32:51.597]  Well, there is an alternative and it's called Novo.
[01:32:51.597 --> 01:32:59.943]  Novo eliminates the bacterial growth which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins.
[01:32:59.943 --> 01:33:04.126]  There are no chemicals, aluminum, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients in Novo.
[01:33:04.466 --> 01:33:10.850]  Just natural ingredients like grapeseed oil, arrowroot powder, silica, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and geranium.
[01:33:10.850 --> 01:33:15.193]  No-BO's job is to destroy the bacteria that causes the odor while soothing your skin.
[01:33:15.193 --> 01:33:19.716]  You can use No-BO under your arms, on tough foot odors, or for athlete's foot.
[01:33:19.716 --> 01:33:24.018]  No-BO is guaranteed 100% or receive a full refund.
[01:33:24.018 --> 01:33:26.700]  Visit No-BO.com to order.
[01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:29.522]  That's No-BO.com or call 850-723-8599.
[01:33:34.562 --> 01:33:40.386]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:40.386 --> 01:33:44.529]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:33:44.529 --> 01:33:52.694]  For another 12 days, we're running the Christmas special, now the New Year's special, until the middle of this month.
[01:33:52.694 --> 01:33:58.778]  You can get almost half a year free at PrisonPlanet.tv when you sign up in the next week and a half.
[01:33:58.778 --> 01:34:02.741]  All my weekly TV reports, my in-studio video reports, other special mini-docs,
[01:34:03.385 --> 01:34:06.968]  That we make all 15 of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book.
[01:34:06.968 --> 01:34:09.529]  Paul Watson's book, by the way, Order Out of Chaos, is now out of print.
[01:34:09.529 --> 01:34:11.451]  We're not probably going to print more.
[01:34:11.451 --> 01:34:12.552]  Can't afford to.
[01:34:12.552 --> 01:34:14.853]  She had to print them like three or four thousand at a time.
[01:34:14.853 --> 01:34:17.095]  You can get that there as an e-book.
[01:34:17.095 --> 01:34:26.782]  There is just so much more at PrisonPlanet.tv and your membership makes this broadcast and the web bandwidth and my webmasters, it funds us.
[01:34:26.782 --> 01:34:31.985]  So I want to thank all the members that are members and I want to ask you if you're not a member, go get a yearly membership and get 5.3 months free.

[01:34:40.158 --> 01:34:43.879]  We have them in super high bandwidth down to low bandwidth downloads.
[01:34:43.879 --> 01:34:47.119]  And you can download it in high bandwidth and it looks almost as good as TV.
[01:34:47.119 --> 01:34:48.680]  In fact, you really can't tell the difference.
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:55.481]  And Burnham to Disk, Terror Storm, Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:34:55.481 --> 01:34:57.441]  Incredible activist tool.
[01:34:57.441 --> 01:35:00.222]  A factory of resistance.

[01:35:12.557 --> 01:35:13.718]  Now they're on DVD.

[01:36:39.232 --> 01:36:41.013]  Back to Mike Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com.
[01:36:41.013 --> 01:36:43.934]  Mike, before I forget, you're starting a show here on Genesis.
[01:36:43.934 --> 01:36:45.715]  We're really honored to have you come on board.
[01:36:45.715 --> 01:36:47.276]  Thank you very much.
[01:36:47.276 --> 01:36:51.478]  It's an honor for me to be on board, and again, thank you very much for all your help getting us to this place.
[01:36:52.186 --> 01:36:58.329]  The show is going to be the What Really Happened Show, and we debut this coming Saturday, January 6th at 11 a.m.
[01:36:58.329 --> 01:37:05.153]  Central Standard Time, and we're going to be doing the show every Saturday, just sort of ramp up to speed and see where it goes from there.
[01:37:05.153 --> 01:37:07.755]  So I'm hoping everybody will have a chance to tune in.
[01:37:07.755 --> 01:37:14.138]  That is 11 o'clock Central Standard Time every Saturday on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:37:14.733 --> 01:37:15.934]  That's absolutely right.
[01:37:15.934 --> 01:37:18.796]  And it's going to be a hard-hitting program, and not just your knowledge and analysis.
[01:37:18.796 --> 01:37:21.458]  You're going to have guests on, you're going to cover the news.
[01:37:21.458 --> 01:37:23.340]  It's going to be a hard-hitting hour.
[01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:29.865]  Yes, it absolutely is, and people can log into my website, WhatReallyHappened.com, to get the topic and guests for the upcoming shows.
[01:37:29.865 --> 01:37:33.107]  We're just locking down a really good guest for the first show.
[01:37:33.107 --> 01:37:35.809]  We haven't got it confirmed yet, so I don't want to say who it is.
[01:37:35.809 --> 01:37:42.874]  But we're going to be covering the topics that we've been covering at the website, and it's going to be very straightforward.
[01:37:44.555 --> 01:37:51.161]  You know, mutually supportive, of course, with what you're doing and the effort that you're making to get the truth out to the American people.
[01:37:51.161 --> 01:37:55.285]  Well, we're glad to be officially teamed up with you, Mike Rivera.
[01:37:55.285 --> 01:37:59.609]  I want to get into the geopolitical system, and obviously the SPEMA camp reports got us
[01:38:00.249 --> 01:38:05.851]  Well, it's not off track, because it's central to what our country is turning into, making dictators act like dictators.
[01:38:05.851 --> 01:38:11.133]  I'm sure you've already seen the BBC report that Bush is now abandoning the fraud.
[01:38:11.133 --> 01:38:12.833]  They were ever going to train Iraqi units.
[01:38:12.833 --> 01:38:14.153]  There were one unit.
[01:38:14.153 --> 01:38:15.714]  One brigade was never ready.
[01:38:15.714 --> 01:38:17.615]  Now they're just saying, no, it's all going to be U.S.
[01:38:17.615 --> 01:38:20.716]  troops fighting, and they want to beef between 20,000 and 40,000 more troops.
[01:38:22.176 --> 01:38:22.416]  Absolutely.
[01:38:22.416 --> 01:38:29.504]  This is already, I mean, the new Congress doesn't even meet for the first time until tomorrow, and already there's a tremendous sense of disillusionment and betrayal among the voters.
[01:38:43.499 --> 01:38:52.607]  Who worked very hard to change the Congress this last election, only to discover that no matter who you vote in, their allegiance is really not to the American people.
[01:38:52.607 --> 01:38:59.193]  And very clearly, first of all, you have to wonder, where is Bush planning on getting all these extra thousands and thousands of soldiers?
[01:38:59.193 --> 01:39:07.721]  They've gutted the National Guard, they've brought up all the reservists, they're luring the immigrants in with promises of green cards when they serve.
[01:39:08.494 --> 01:39:17.346]  Uh, obviously, you know, as we see the draft boards ramp up and go through their testing, it is very obvious that at some point we are going to have a draft imposed on us.
[01:39:17.346 --> 01:39:20.189]  And all these big public officials saying a draft's good?
[01:39:20.189 --> 01:39:22.292]  I mean, they got a full court press PR going.
[01:39:23.013 --> 01:39:44.530]  Absolutely, and they're saying a draft is going to be good because it'll force the rich people to send their kids along with the poor people, which we know from Vietnam will not be the case because we kept hearing promise after promise that the draft was going to be equal and everybody was going to have to serve, and yet we saw predominantly people from the poor sections of society were on the front lines in Vietnam.
[01:39:45.138 --> 01:39:50.501]  And even those children of the more privileged classes were kept in rear echelon positions.
[01:39:50.501 --> 01:39:55.964]  They were given clerical jobs or computer jobs or basically just away from the actual fighting.
[01:39:55.964 --> 01:39:58.286]  So we're going to see this ramp up here.
[01:39:58.286 --> 01:40:03.749]  And very obviously, Bush is still trying to figure out a way that he can justify going into Iran.
[01:40:03.749 --> 01:40:06.571]  Now we're seeing news coming out this morning that the U.S.
[01:40:06.571 --> 01:40:12.534]  is covertly funding Syrian opposition groups in an attempt to destabilize Syria as well.
[01:40:13.122 --> 01:40:16.656]  And what is very clearly going on, and I pointed this out a couple of years ago,
[01:40:17.262 --> 01:40:19.064]  Uh, is that we're seeing the U.S.
[01:40:19.064 --> 01:40:25.128]  start to garrison the entire Middle East in order to control what remains of the world's easily reachable oil.
[01:40:25.128 --> 01:40:26.769]  And that was always the strategy.
[01:40:26.769 --> 01:40:34.255]  It's not like it was a secret, was to have sectarian war, break Iraq in three pieces, break Syria in three pieces, break Iran in four pieces.
[01:40:34.255 --> 01:40:36.056]  They want sectarian violence.
[01:40:36.056 --> 01:40:39.198]  They want the Muslims mad, overthrowing the Saudis.
[01:40:39.198 --> 01:40:40.419]  They want hysteria.
[01:40:40.419 --> 01:40:43.922]  They want to create a quagmire that forces total commitment.
[01:40:44.745 --> 01:40:46.567]  Well, what is going on is the U.S.
[01:40:46.567 --> 01:40:52.332]  realized it could never directly confront the Iraqis, the Iranians, the Syrians, and win militarily.
[01:40:52.332 --> 01:40:55.295]  We just saw how Israel couldn't even really deal with Lebanon.
[01:40:55.295 --> 01:41:00.360]  So they lied about WMDs and wantonly went in and destabilized the whole region.
[01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:01.041]  Exactly.
[01:41:01.041 --> 01:41:06.786]  And if you remember back at the beginning of the Iraq War, they were catching all these British SAS and American operatives.
[01:41:07.106 --> 01:41:10.589]  Dressed as Arabs, driving around in cars loaded with explosives.
[01:41:10.589 --> 01:41:15.993]  So much of this so-called sectarian violence is actually being done by our own assets.
[01:41:15.993 --> 01:41:22.137]  And by the way, Bill Christensen, CIA Section Chief, and of course, Ray McGovern, George Bush Sr.'
[01:41:22.117 --> 01:41:26.200]  's Chief CIA Analyst, have said clearly our government's staging attacks over there.
[01:41:26.807 --> 01:41:30.749]  Yeah, in order to trick the Iraqis into killing each other off.
[01:41:30.749 --> 01:41:32.209]  Now let's talk about Saddam.
[01:41:32.209 --> 01:41:35.590]  Killing him on Eden, the day of forgiveness.
[01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:37.071]  Killing him on the start of it.
[01:41:37.071 --> 01:41:41.413]  Letting them see the Shiites taunt him before they hang him.
[01:41:41.413 --> 01:41:45.974]  All of this designed patently to make everybody get mad.
[01:41:45.974 --> 01:41:46.995]  Absolutely agree.
[01:41:46.995 --> 01:41:50.036]  That one cell phone video that has been leaked out onto the net
[01:41:50.456 --> 01:42:04.180]  If you watch that video carefully, it is obvious that whoever is making it is not trying to conceal the camera he's using, he's just holding it up there and getting a clear shot, so whoever this was had permission to have that camera there to leak the video out.
[01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:16.364]  Exactly, the state cuts off right before they start taunting him, but so the state can't be openly implicated in stirring up sectarian violence, like they've done blowing up the Golden Mosque and the rest of it, then it cuts in right with a cell phone on perfect time.
[01:42:16.989 --> 01:42:18.570]  Yeah, absolutely it does.
[01:42:18.570 --> 01:42:23.672]  And it's a way to get the video out there while making it look like it wasn't an official release.
[01:42:23.672 --> 01:42:28.333]  But it does reek of an official psyops operation.
[01:42:28.333 --> 01:42:29.314]  I'll tell you one thing, though.
[01:42:29.314 --> 01:42:37.737]  Looking at the international condemnation, and certainly from my reader letters, as a public relations move, I think this has blown up in Bush's face.
[01:42:37.737 --> 01:42:39.858]  It's actually unifying the Arabs.
[01:42:39.858 --> 01:42:41.239]  They're seeing right through it.
[01:42:41.239 --> 01:42:42.299]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:42:42.299 --> 01:42:44.980]  And now, of course, we're seeing the White House trying to distance themselves
[01:42:45.493 --> 01:42:49.956]  Uh, from the execution saying they tried to convince the Iraqi government to delay the execution.
[01:42:49.956 --> 01:42:54.278]  They ran the whole fake trial and delivered him into the Shiite's hands.
[01:42:54.278 --> 01:42:54.839]  Absolutely.
[01:42:54.839 --> 01:42:57.020]  The gallows was built inside a U.S.
[01:42:57.020 --> 01:42:57.380]  base.
[01:42:57.380 --> 01:42:59.902]  I mean, all I had to do was say, we don't want the gallows here.
[01:42:59.902 --> 01:43:01.203]  We're not going to turn them over.
[01:43:01.203 --> 01:43:03.644]  And they could have delayed the execution.
[01:43:03.644 --> 01:43:04.925]  So this is just very pat.
[01:43:05.589 --> 01:43:08.651]  Attempt to distance from what has turned into a public relations disaster.
[01:43:08.651 --> 01:43:22.299]  By the way, I found on Rents.com an incredible compilation of UPI articles from the 80s and others where they admitted what we already knew, Saddam in the 50s hired, running assassinations for the CIA.
[01:43:22.299 --> 01:43:28.843]  So I'm not defending him, but clearly it's like a mafia capo going to the electric chair when the don sits as the judge.
[01:43:28.843 --> 01:43:32.485]  You know, the mob boss is the guy condemning the person they ordered.
[01:43:32.905 --> 01:43:35.506]  But the way he had so much courage when they killed him.
[01:43:35.506 --> 01:43:36.686]  Very stoic.
[01:43:36.686 --> 01:43:37.926]  Very cinematic.
[01:43:37.926 --> 01:43:41.927]  And our media had the nerve to try to lie and claim he was cowering and crying.
[01:43:41.927 --> 01:43:47.048]  Trying to feed the psyche of so many cowardly people out there that would get off on that.
[01:43:47.048 --> 01:43:48.628]  I mean, the guy died with courage.
[01:43:48.628 --> 01:43:49.929]  They might as well just admit it.
[01:43:49.929 --> 01:43:52.089]  That guy died with amazing courage.
[01:43:52.089 --> 01:43:56.050]  Yeah, he did have a lot of dignity and courage going up to the gallows.
[01:43:56.050 --> 01:43:58.711]  And one can only imagine... You know, they just hate that.
[01:43:58.711 --> 01:44:00.531]  They were trying to get him to blow up, calling him names.
[01:44:01.255 --> 01:44:02.276]  Yeah, they were.
[01:44:02.276 --> 01:44:10.459]  They wanted him to make a spectacle, and Saddam was just not going to let them get to him, and that was, if anything, his final victory.
[01:44:10.459 --> 01:44:11.860]  Let's just admit it.
[01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:18.703]  I mean, you know, they hate real men, and the guy was a tyrant, but he worked for our government, and he was a real man, and they can't stand that.
[01:44:18.703 --> 01:44:22.445]  They absolutely cannot, and Bush has made his own worst nightmare.
[01:44:22.445 --> 01:44:28.028]  They took this manufactured monster that they had, and they've succeeded in turning him into a martyr and a victim.
[01:44:28.490 --> 01:44:29.250]  And a symbol.
[01:44:29.250 --> 01:44:35.053]  And Saddam is going to be more dangerous now at a symbol than he ever was as a living person.
[01:44:35.053 --> 01:44:36.674]  I'll tell you, that is powerful footage.
[01:44:36.674 --> 01:44:38.835]  And those guys like wolves and those black masks.
[01:44:38.835 --> 01:44:42.717]  I mean, you know... I mean, it's just... It's sick!
[01:44:42.717 --> 01:44:48.120]  And of course, parallel that to the guy sawing the head off of Nick Berg.
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:50.461]  I mean, it's the same type scene.
[01:44:50.461 --> 01:44:51.522]  Yeah, it absolutely is.
[01:44:51.522 --> 01:44:54.823]  It almost feels like they've got the same director.
[01:44:54.823 --> 01:44:55.604]  Yeah.
[01:44:55.604 --> 01:44:55.704]  Yeah.
[01:44:57.541 --> 01:45:00.003]  I tell you, but you know, I mean, take Lynch.
[01:45:00.003 --> 01:45:01.785]  They clearly killed a bunch of people in her unit.
[01:45:01.785 --> 01:45:03.786]  Remember, they were shooting their mouths off, saying it was all fake.
[01:45:03.786 --> 01:45:05.388]  They all started getting shot and dying.
[01:45:05.388 --> 01:45:07.369]  And then she came out and said it was a fable.
[01:45:07.369 --> 01:45:12.954]  It's come out that the, I've talked to, by the way, to Kevin Tillman.
[01:45:12.954 --> 01:45:14.675]  He's close to coming on the show.
[01:45:14.675 --> 01:45:16.317]  There's a lot more you haven't heard about that.
[01:45:16.317 --> 01:45:19.439]  It seems like everything they do blows up in their face.
[01:45:19.439 --> 01:45:23.523]  Well, they do, and it's because of radio shows like ours and websites like ours.
[01:45:23.894 --> 01:45:28.875]  Because the monopoly on information flow from the government to the people has been broken.
[01:45:28.875 --> 01:45:31.176]  And I'm afraid that the people in charge of the U.S.
[01:45:31.176 --> 01:45:42.698]  government have never really come to understand how that dynamic, that basic equation of information flow through the society, has dramatically changed because of the Internet, because of independent radio.
[01:45:42.698 --> 01:45:47.439]  They tried to buy it all up by creating companies like Clear Channel.
[01:45:47.439 --> 01:45:51.700]  They tried to sort of monopolize it and reassert that control again, but they have failed to do it.
[01:45:52.322 --> 01:46:03.491]  And unfortunately for them, and fortunately for us, they're never going to get that kind of total control over information that they had back in the 50s and 60s and even into the 70s.
[01:46:03.491 --> 01:46:04.912]  It is gone forever.
[01:46:04.912 --> 01:46:11.677]  But they still are a bunch of arrogant old men because I see them on Meet the Press and other shows going, so what would the blog say?
[01:46:11.677 --> 01:46:14.519]  So people are writing their own diaries on the web.
[01:46:14.519 --> 01:46:15.760]  Ha ha, who cares?
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:16.981]  Hey, we care, folks.
[01:46:16.981 --> 01:46:19.163]  We all want to communicate with each other.
[01:46:19.163 --> 01:46:21.485]  And they still, I think they still don't get it.
[01:46:21.485 --> 01:46:21.845]  You're right.
[01:46:22.265 --> 01:46:23.866]  Yeah, I don't think they get it at all.
[01:46:23.866 --> 01:46:29.910]  They're still trying to play the game by the rules that worked at the height of the Cold War, and they don't understand the environment has changed.
[01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:37.354]  And, you know, biologists who study evolution, they say that extinction is what happens when a life form fails to adapt to a changing environment.
[01:46:37.354 --> 01:46:41.917]  And that, I'm seeing a lot of that happening within portions of our government right now.
[01:46:41.917 --> 01:46:46.760]  They're not adapting to the new reality of information flow in the society.
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:51.203]  And they're trying to play the game by the rules that used to work, and they don't recognize it's not working anymore.
[01:46:51.866 --> 01:47:04.735]  I'm going to go to some calls here, Mike Rivera, but I first want to get your take on what you think the top stories in 2006 were, what you think the big stories, and I don't mean what the media says are big, but what you think is most important in 2007.
[01:47:04.735 --> 01:47:18.844]  Well, I think obviously going back to 2006, although it's an earlier story, continues to be the lies that led to war, that tricked us into war, and certainly going into 2007, the Bush White House is just going to play the same game again.
[01:47:18.844 --> 01:47:20.605]  They're going to make up a bunch of lies about Iran,
[01:47:21.101 --> 01:47:35.550]  As a justification descending in military force, I am hopeful that the American people in 2007 are going to see the wisdom of the fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me statement, which Bush himself seems to mangle so badly.
[01:47:35.550 --> 01:47:39.693]  But are the American people going to sit still for the same hoax all over again?
[01:47:39.693 --> 01:47:40.433]  I don't think so.
[01:47:40.433 --> 01:47:41.814]  I'm sensing a lot of anger out there.
[01:47:43.291 --> 01:47:51.714]  But the wild card is government-sponsored terror, with 84% believing the official story is a lie, 36% believing total inside job on 9-11.
[01:47:51.714 --> 01:47:59.037]  Can the globalists stage more terror, make it convincing enough to rally the people around their faltering policy?
[01:47:59.037 --> 01:48:00.398]  I don't think they could pull it off.
[01:48:00.398 --> 01:48:03.279]  I'm hoping that they recognize that they can't pull it off.
[01:48:03.279 --> 01:48:08.401]  But unfortunately, in times like this, events are under the control of the person who's the least mentally stable.
[01:48:09.003 --> 01:48:15.848]  And there are certainly individuals within both our government and that of Israel who might say, let's give it a try anyway.
[01:48:15.848 --> 01:48:18.849]  We can always bluff our way out of it if it doesn't work.
[01:48:18.849 --> 01:48:22.612]  And it could really blow up in their faces.
[01:48:22.612 --> 01:48:25.174]  So the bravado and the chutzpah factor.
[01:48:25.174 --> 01:48:28.095]  Yeah, and the hubris.
[01:48:28.095 --> 01:48:36.981]  And definitely if you go back and you look through history, some of the worst political disasters of all time have been triggered when a government attempted to pull off one deception too many.
[01:48:36.981 --> 01:48:38.162]  Hitler turning east.
[01:48:39.052 --> 01:48:43.274]  Exactly, and just saying, okay, we don't buy this anymore.
[01:48:43.274 --> 01:48:46.816]  If they go into Iran, that's clearly turning east.
[01:48:46.816 --> 01:48:48.457]  Absolutely, I agree with you.
[01:48:48.457 --> 01:48:58.943]  I cannot understand why Bush and his people think that they have a chance to pull this off without arousing not only the anger of Americans, but response by the rest of the world.
[01:48:58.943 --> 01:49:02.945]  But I'm getting a very strong sense that Bush and his people have isolated themselves.
[01:49:02.945 --> 01:49:06.447]  They've got a bunch of yes-men, layers of yes-men and yes-women around them.
[01:49:06.969 --> 01:49:14.011]  Where Bush may not realize how ugly the mood of the American voters... But obviously Bush was put in there to run with the ball.
[01:49:14.011 --> 01:49:15.652]  He gets the blame if he drops it.
[01:49:15.652 --> 01:49:21.454]  But I mean obviously the big oil companies, the big banks, the Rothschild types, you know, they're going along with all this too.
[01:49:21.454 --> 01:49:27.755]  They may see themselves as not having any more choice because if you get back to the economic roots of all of this... The bubble's about to burst.
[01:49:27.755 --> 01:49:29.156]  They gotta pump it up somehow.
[01:49:29.156 --> 01:49:30.516]  The bubble is about to burst.
[01:49:30.516 --> 01:49:34.357]  The only way they can reverse it is if oil becomes an exported U.S.
[01:49:34.357 --> 01:49:35.878]  product rather than an imported one.
[01:49:36.428 --> 01:49:52.881]  So, what they're doing, going back to an analogy for a card game called hearts, there's a card game called hearts, and there's a tactic in there called shooting the moon, where you deliberately go in the wrong direction, but if you can succeed in going all the way, you can reverse the score of the game and win.
[01:49:52.881 --> 01:49:58.805]  But of course, if you fail to get all the way that opposite direction, you've buried yourself so deeply you can never win again.
[01:49:58.805 --> 01:50:02.048]  And I'm seeing that kind of mechanism at work, where the U.S.
[01:50:02.048 --> 01:50:05.090]  is just trying to find any way that they can grab control of the oil,
[01:50:05.498 --> 01:50:13.465]  Which means not only revenues reversing across the trade deficit, but the means to coerce other governments to back off on U.S.
[01:50:13.465 --> 01:50:21.011]  debt, to keep supporting the trade deficit by stockpiling dollars, to keep using the dollars, the oil currency of choice.
[01:50:21.011 --> 01:50:22.753]  All of these things depend on U.S.
[01:50:22.753 --> 01:50:24.414]  control of the world.
[01:50:24.414 --> 01:50:25.635]  But it's not happening quick enough.
[01:50:25.635 --> 01:50:27.336]  The dollar's continuing its slide.
[01:50:27.336 --> 01:50:29.298]  No, it isn't happening quick enough.
[01:50:29.298 --> 01:50:30.139]  It's not succeeding.
[01:50:30.695 --> 01:50:38.519]  Unfortunately, that is going to make the people who are dependent upon this success that much more desperate, and desperate people do desperately stupid things.
[01:50:38.519 --> 01:50:39.719]  Mike Rivero, I totally agree.
[01:50:39.719 --> 01:50:42.681]  We're going to come back and go to Jenna, KC, and others.
[01:50:42.681 --> 01:50:50.224]  We'll also get an update from Kevin as we start the next hour in about 10 minutes from the FEMA camp up in Taylor.
[01:50:51.070 --> 01:50:52.430]  Texas, just north of Austin.
[01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:57.531]  Kevin Smith, my radio producer, and Aaron Dykes, webmaster and cameraman.
[01:50:57.531 --> 01:50:59.312]  We all wear many hats here.
[01:50:59.312 --> 01:51:01.812]  Up there, Counterpunch reported there'd be a protest there today.
[01:51:01.812 --> 01:51:03.933]  There's been two others that have been in the paper.
[01:51:03.933 --> 01:51:04.913]  Counterpunch was wrong.
[01:51:04.913 --> 01:51:06.173]  No one was there.
[01:51:06.173 --> 01:51:07.414]  We are there.
[01:51:07.414 --> 01:51:14.015]  We're asking you to go up there just as, basically, as observers to observe what's happening.
[01:51:14.636 --> 01:51:19.382]  And to witness what's happening up there at the railway leading to the admitted FEMA camp.
[01:51:19.382 --> 01:51:24.710]  It is a processing relocation center by its actual name.
[01:51:24.710 --> 01:51:28.074]  Infowars.com, prisonplanted.com are my websites.
[01:51:28.074 --> 01:51:30.017]  WhatReallyHappened.com is our guest site.
[01:51:37.006 --> 01:51:42.815]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:51:42.815 --> 01:51:50.466]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:51:51.147 --> 01:51:58.610]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:51:58.610 --> 01:52:10.335]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:52:10.335 --> 01:52:14.297]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:52:14.297 --> 01:52:16.558]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:52:16.558 --> 01:52:20.400]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:54:39.343 --> 01:54:41.686]  American forces are here to help.
[01:54:41.686 --> 01:54:43.148]  Remain calm.
[01:54:43.148 --> 01:54:47.454]  We will not tolerate civil disobedience.
[01:54:47.454 --> 01:54:50.017]  Attention, attention, attention.
[01:54:50.017 --> 01:54:52.281]  American forces are here to help.
[01:54:52.281 --> 01:54:53.122]  Please remain calm.
[01:54:57.585 --> 01:55:18.999]  I've made two documentary films about the police state and been to dozens of these military training operations where they hire hundreds of role players to beg and scream, we're Americans, please don't put us in camps, don't take our guns.
[01:55:18.999 --> 01:55:19.599]  Welcome back.
[01:55:21.688 --> 01:55:23.491]  I have, uh, that's from Police State 2000.
[01:55:23.491 --> 01:55:25.435]  We just grabbed that off the web.
[01:55:25.435 --> 01:55:30.283]  Do you want to do a search on YouTube, uh, for...
[01:55:33.030 --> 01:55:39.332]  FEMA hearings or something like it'll pop my head a keyword to search for it.
[01:55:39.332 --> 01:55:41.113]  Folks, you need to get my Police State Trilogy.
[01:55:41.113 --> 01:55:41.953]  It has it all.
[01:55:41.953 --> 01:55:42.914]  Kevin Smith is up there.
[01:55:42.914 --> 01:55:43.934]  I just talked to him during the break.
[01:55:43.934 --> 01:55:44.974]  They're going back to the front.
[01:55:44.974 --> 01:55:47.455]  Looks like some folks may have showed up in support.
[01:55:47.455 --> 01:55:49.576]  Other people need to go out there to the FEMA camp.
[01:55:49.576 --> 01:55:51.117]  Get past your fear.
[01:55:51.117 --> 01:55:53.137]  Go out there just as observers.
[01:55:53.137 --> 01:55:53.838]  They're in Taylor.
[01:55:53.838 --> 01:55:57.479]  If you just get to downtown Taylor, you can ask where's the camp and they'll direct you to it.
[01:55:58.517 --> 01:56:00.479]  They're going to be there until the end of the next hour.
[01:56:00.479 --> 01:56:01.740]  We'll give you a report.
[01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:07.084]  Mike Rivera, I'd ask her to stay five minutes with me until the next hour so we have time to take calls.
[01:56:07.084 --> 01:56:11.567]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jenna in Ontario, Canada.
[01:56:11.567 --> 01:56:12.348]  You're on the air.
[01:56:12.348 --> 01:56:12.868]  Go ahead.
[01:56:12.868 --> 01:56:14.229]  Hi Alex.
[01:56:14.229 --> 01:56:20.814]  I called in a couple weeks ago and we were talking about the police state in Canada and how brutal it was.
[01:56:20.814 --> 01:56:23.136]  I think the very next day it could have been.
[01:56:23.136 --> 01:56:27.559]  I heard that they're starting to do, I'm not sure if they started or if they're trying
[01:56:27.915 --> 01:56:31.336]  But they're trying to do these random search warrants.
[01:56:31.336 --> 01:56:34.257]  Like, you go on a list, I believe.
[01:56:34.257 --> 01:56:39.538]  Like, say I had a friend who bought some pot off somebody and he was on that list.
[01:56:39.538 --> 01:56:41.518]  Both of us are on that list now.
[01:56:41.518 --> 01:56:45.099]  And they can basically come to my door with a warrant and search my home.
[01:56:45.099 --> 01:56:45.619]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:56:45.619 --> 01:56:46.740]  They're trying that in the U.S.
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:47.160]  too.
[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:54.321]  It's a list of suspicion because you, it shows, have a social network with someone else who got in trouble.
[01:56:54.321 --> 01:56:55.702]  Now they're going to come after you.
[01:56:55.702 --> 01:56:56.242]  Mike Rivera?
[01:56:57.535 --> 01:57:13.882]  Well, unfortunately, it's guilt by association, and part of it is to simply convince people to stay isolated, because isolated people are easier to lie to, because they're not talking to anybody, and it's not really... Yeah, that's why they're announcing the NSA spying on everything.
[01:57:13.882 --> 01:57:16.403]  It's an attempt at chilling.
[01:57:16.403 --> 01:57:17.103]  Exactly right.
[01:57:17.103 --> 01:57:18.984]  And the idea has got nothing to do with pot-selling.
[01:57:18.984 --> 01:57:24.126]  What it is is they want people to not talk to people like, frankly, Alex and myself,
[01:57:24.545 --> 01:57:27.706]  Because we're saying things the government does not want to get out.
[01:57:27.706 --> 01:57:29.487]  They can't stop it on the internet.
[01:57:29.487 --> 01:57:32.528]  They're trying to at least stop it among the population.
[01:57:32.528 --> 01:57:34.709]  But all they're doing is validating us!
[01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:40.471]  All they're doing is... Americans aren't as cowardly, Canadians aren't as cowardly as they thought!
[01:57:40.471 --> 01:57:50.255]  Yeah, it is an act of desperation, and it goes back to that saying that we have that the fastest way to end a dictatorship is to make it act like one where everybody can see it, and that's exactly what they're doing now.
[01:57:52.017 --> 01:57:53.178]  Anything else, Jenna?
[01:57:53.178 --> 01:57:53.799]  No, that's it.
[01:57:53.799 --> 01:57:56.901]  I just thought that was really brutal and worth telling you about.
[01:57:56.901 --> 01:57:58.503]  I did see that.
[01:57:58.503 --> 01:58:07.211]  They also have the Texas State Police in Canada in two provinces teaching your mounted police how to run a checkpoint without warrants.
[01:58:07.211 --> 01:58:08.492]  I mean, how embarrassing.
[01:58:09.184 --> 01:58:11.747]  Yeah, that was in the Associated Press and Washington Post.
[01:58:11.747 --> 01:58:13.588]  Did you see that, Mike, where they're doing that?
[01:58:13.588 --> 01:58:16.431]  Yes, I did, and it is amazing.
[01:58:16.431 --> 01:58:19.514]  It's big business to teach how to get around the civil liberties problem.
[01:58:19.514 --> 01:58:25.900]  You know, it's so good to talk to a factoid newshound like myself, because you've always seen everything I've seen and more.
[01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:27.182]  It's good to go, hey, did you see that?
[01:58:27.182 --> 01:58:28.603]  Yeah, I saw that, because that's all we do.
[01:58:29.964 --> 01:58:35.548]  Mike, I know you run a successful business yourself in special effects, but what is it like for you?
[01:58:35.548 --> 01:58:41.292]  Is it as addicting to you as it is for me to always want to know more?
[01:58:41.292 --> 01:58:44.294]  Unfortunately, yes, and it is a contagious addiction.
[01:58:44.294 --> 01:58:49.757]  But on the other hand, I think spreading this particular addiction is the key to getting our republic back.
[01:58:49.757 --> 01:58:50.178]  I agree.
[01:58:51.753 --> 01:58:53.174]  Third hour, straight ahead.
[01:58:53.174 --> 01:58:57.718]  KC, Nathan, Harvey, Eric will be the only calls we take.
[01:58:57.718 --> 01:59:00.880]  Then I'm going to play some clips from a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:05.183]  Another clip from CNN about cover-up concerning Oklahoma City by the government.
[01:59:05.183 --> 01:59:06.464]  It's finally breaking.
[01:59:06.464 --> 01:59:09.626]  And another little clip concerning the Loving Kim trails.
[01:59:09.626 --> 01:59:14.210]  We'll be right back in 70 seconds.
[01:59:14.210 --> 01:59:18.433]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:59:23.826 --> 01:59:31.629]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger, your source for free solar electricity.
[01:59:31.629 --> 01:59:38.872]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:59:38.872 --> 01:59:50.796]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[01:59:50.796 --> 01:59:52.477]  Its multi-voltage capabilities
[01:59:52.637 --> 01:59:53.257]  We're good to go!
[02:00:23.934 --> 02:00:26.337]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:26.337 --> 02:00:35.668]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:35.668 --> 02:00:36.990]  Big Brother.
[02:00:36.990 --> 02:00:38.752]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:38.752 --> 02:00:40.514]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:40.514 --> 02:00:42.096]  You want answers?
[02:00:42.096 --> 02:00:42.877]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:44.013 --> 02:00:47.814]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:47.814 --> 02:00:57.136]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:57.136 --> 02:01:01.177]  Now into hour number three of this January 2nd, 2006 edition.
[02:01:01.177 --> 02:01:03.057]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:01:03.057 --> 02:01:05.058]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:19.363]  Aaron Dykes, one of my cameramen, and Kevin Smith are there at the FEMA camp, the Admitted Relocation Center that they've opened with men, women, and children in it in Taylor, Texas.
[02:01:19.363 --> 02:01:24.990]  We'll have a report from him at the bottom of the hour and on some of the folks that have showed up there to observe.
[02:01:25.490 --> 02:01:26.151]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:01:26.151 --> 02:01:26.831]  Good, you're going to love this.
[02:01:26.831 --> 02:01:27.591]  George Bush Sr.
[02:01:27.591 --> 02:01:28.192]  today at Ford's funeral.
[02:01:51.075 --> 02:02:02.106]  He said something to the effect that contrary to what conspiracy theorists think, the Warren Commission still stands because it had Ford's good name signed to it.
[02:02:02.106 --> 02:02:03.087]  This was on television?
[02:02:03.087 --> 02:02:04.408]  I'd love to have that on tape.
[02:02:04.408 --> 02:02:05.449]  This was at his funeral.
[02:02:05.449 --> 02:02:07.632]  I'm sure lots of people are taping it, but...
[02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:10.601]  It was crazy.
[02:02:10.601 --> 02:02:13.364]  Well, they're going to re-air it on C-SPAN, I'll be sure and tape it.
[02:02:13.364 --> 02:02:14.705]  Thank you for that info.
[02:02:14.705 --> 02:02:23.333]  Of course, 92% of Americans, if you index, I average 12 polls together, 92% believe that the government was involved.
[02:02:23.333 --> 02:02:25.315]  You want to comment on that, Mike Rivera?
[02:02:25.315 --> 02:02:32.482]  Well, this is a very strange statement for Bush to be making because Gerald Ford was forced to admit that he had altered the Warren reports
[02:02:33.158 --> 02:02:39.702]  Uh, location of Kennedy's back wound, uh, to move it up closer to the neck to line up with the magic bullet theory.
[02:02:39.702 --> 02:02:49.268]  So here we have Gerald Ford, you know, himself, uh, was part of the cover-up because he turned a shoulder wound into a neck wound so that the magic bullet would all line up.
[02:02:49.268 --> 02:02:56.913]  But this shows their arrogance that they'd shoot their mouth off when 92% of us know they're liars and they just still think what they say holds water.
[02:02:57.765 --> 02:03:02.247]  Like I said, they're still playing the game by the rules that worked back in the 50s, 60s, and 70s.
[02:03:02.247 --> 02:03:11.651]  They haven't really caught on how quickly their lives are going to get exposed out here in alternative radio and in the internet.
[02:03:11.651 --> 02:03:12.371]  It's unbelievable.
[02:03:12.371 --> 02:03:18.754]  They've also tried to flood the web with disinfo, but people develop a palate to recognize baloney very fast.
[02:03:18.754 --> 02:03:26.077]  Yeah, they're actually training us to be more discerning and skeptical, and it's making us all better citizens, better researchers,
[02:03:26.762 --> 02:03:29.464]  Uh, and just really much more discerning.
[02:03:29.464 --> 02:03:31.626]  And in the long run it's going to work against them.
[02:03:31.626 --> 02:03:35.969]  It's fun seeing the COINTELPRO people pull their hair out on the web and attack us, isn't it, Mike?
[02:03:35.969 --> 02:03:37.350]  Yes, it is.
[02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:39.651]  Let's just know we're really hitting them hard.
[02:03:39.651 --> 02:03:40.272]  Absolutely.
[02:03:40.272 --> 02:03:42.574]  Anything else, KC?
[02:03:42.574 --> 02:03:47.357]  Well, I thought it was kind of interesting because there was two sides to it.
[02:03:47.357 --> 02:03:52.821]  It was kind of like, A, you have the fact that he's kind of revealing his insecurities to the world.
[02:03:53.956 --> 02:03:57.079]  About, you know, the JFK assassination.
[02:03:57.079 --> 02:04:06.946]  And then B, it's kind of like a backhanded insult because now that he's dead, wasn't he like one of the only people alive left to be able to testify about it?
[02:04:06.946 --> 02:04:08.667]  Yes.
[02:04:08.667 --> 02:04:11.389]  Right, so it's like, that kind of threw me.
[02:04:11.389 --> 02:04:13.530]  Well also, all the evidence shows that Bush Sr.
[02:04:13.530 --> 02:04:22.777]  was in the CIA at the time, involved in Bay of Pigs, involved in operations, you know, the different rifle groups, and was in Dallas when that happened.
[02:04:22.777 --> 02:04:22.957]  Mike?
[02:04:23.638 --> 02:04:24.359]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:04:24.359 --> 02:04:25.800]  That's what I was going to point out.
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:27.341]  Bush himself was neck deep.
[02:04:27.341 --> 02:04:30.644]  He was working with Felix Rodriguez in the Cuban operation.
[02:04:30.644 --> 02:04:35.508]  He loaned some of his company's ships to support the Bay of Pigs operation.
[02:04:35.508 --> 02:04:41.673]  So, Bush himself could probably testify if some means could be found to coerce the truth out of him.
[02:04:41.673 --> 02:04:44.835]  I think he's getting doddering and slithering up.
[02:04:44.835 --> 02:04:45.676]  Could very well be.
[02:04:46.687 --> 02:04:47.108]  All right.
[02:04:47.108 --> 02:04:48.489]  Thank you for that information.
[02:04:48.489 --> 02:04:49.990]  I really appreciate it, KC.
[02:04:49.990 --> 02:04:50.991]  So much happening.
[02:04:50.991 --> 02:04:55.435]  Mike Rivera, your new show starts this Saturday, 11 a.m.
[02:04:55.435 --> 02:04:57.938]  Central Time, here on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:04:57.938 --> 02:05:01.841]  I hope some of our affiliates out there will give it a listen and pick it up.
[02:05:01.841 --> 02:05:03.943]  And I appreciate you coming on with us.
[02:05:03.943 --> 02:05:05.725]  Well, thank you, and we'll talk to you next month.
[02:05:05.725 --> 02:05:06.226]  All right.
[02:05:06.226 --> 02:05:09.349]  And the website's WhatReallyHappened.com.
[02:05:09.349 --> 02:05:10.069]  Thanks for being with us.
[02:05:10.069 --> 02:05:10.750]  Thank you.
[02:05:11.574 --> 02:05:13.296]  All right, there goes Mike Rivero.
[02:05:13.296 --> 02:05:15.339]  You can join him this Saturday.
[02:05:15.339 --> 02:05:24.909]  Come back, I'll talk to Harry and Eric, maybe one or two others, and I want to play a few news clips in this Twilight Zone piece that shows volumes of what we face today.
[02:05:24.909 --> 02:05:27.993]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com are the websites.
[02:05:27.993 --> 02:05:28.954]  Check out PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:05:34.486 --> 02:05:37.991]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:05:37.991 --> 02:05:40.315]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:05:40.315 --> 02:05:47.966]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:05:48.641 --> 02:05:56.084]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:05:56.084 --> 02:06:07.828]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:06:07.828 --> 02:06:11.769]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:06:11.769 --> 02:06:14.050]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:06:14.050 --> 02:06:17.811]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:06:31.366 --> 02:06:36.731]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:06:36.731 --> 02:06:45.078]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:06:45.078 --> 02:06:52.144]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:06:52.304 --> 02:06:53.664]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:06:53.664 --> 02:06:59.746]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:06:59.746 --> 02:07:04.968]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:07:04.968 --> 02:07:14.090]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:07:14.090 --> 02:07:18.851]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium.

[02:07:27.834 --> 02:07:30.795]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:07:30.795 --> 02:07:33.897]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?
[02:07:33.897 --> 02:07:40.419]  Since January of 2006, RxDrugCard.com members have saved an average of $33 per prescription filled.
[02:07:40.419 --> 02:07:42.740]  That's over 46% savings!
[02:07:42.740 --> 02:07:45.040]  The average savings for generic drugs was over 71%.
[02:07:46.821 --> 02:07:55.523]  RxDrugCard.com is the only major discount prescription drug plan that offers a price lookup page, so you can get an idea of your discounted price before you enroll.

[02:08:16.667 --> 02:08:18.288]  We're running out of time.
[02:08:18.288 --> 02:08:21.451]  I've got three big audio clips on the plate.
[02:08:21.451 --> 02:08:23.453]  An update there at the FEMA camp, Kevin Smith.
[02:08:46.397 --> 02:08:54.422]  They're dealing with, uh, well, they're telling them to turn their cameras off, they want to review the tapes, them saying no.
[02:08:54.422 --> 02:08:58.885]  This is a FEMA camp where they're holding reportedly illegal aliens, but they admit it can hold U.S.
[02:08:58.885 --> 02:09:01.927]  citizens, too, under FEMA directives.
[02:09:01.927 --> 02:09:04.669]  It looks into the whole martial law umbrella, very serious.
[02:09:05.803 --> 02:09:12.928]  Let's take two calls, two final calls, quickly before I get into the rest of the information for this hour on this live January 2nd edition.
[02:09:12.928 --> 02:09:15.010]  Harvey in Florida, then Eric in Kansas.
[02:09:15.010 --> 02:09:16.091]  Harvey, go ahead.
[02:09:16.091 --> 02:09:17.272]  Yes, hello Alex.
[02:09:17.272 --> 02:09:18.032]  How are you today?
[02:09:18.032 --> 02:09:18.853]  Good, sir.
[02:09:18.853 --> 02:09:20.114]  It's great to talk to you again.
[02:09:20.114 --> 02:09:28.600]  You know, you talked about it several times and I'll confirm that I know of a woman whose husband is a local sheriff here in Central Florida, a little two-bit town.
[02:09:29.875 --> 02:09:34.756]  And he's been sent off to FBI headquarters for several months of training and interrogation.
[02:09:34.756 --> 02:09:40.537]  Oh yeah, they're federalizing all of them, building fusion command centers with CIA and FBI over it.
[02:09:40.537 --> 02:09:41.597]  It's a nightmare.
[02:09:41.597 --> 02:09:42.597]  It's absolutely true.
[02:09:42.597 --> 02:09:45.458]  But they won't control the border!
[02:09:45.458 --> 02:09:50.699]  They were giving him special, teaching him new interrogation techniques, and his wife is scared to death.
[02:09:50.699 --> 02:09:51.719]  She confided in me.
[02:09:51.719 --> 02:09:52.119]  Oh really?
[02:09:52.119 --> 02:09:54.699]  What else was she telling you?
[02:09:54.699 --> 02:09:59.300]  Well, she was very nervous because he was practicing his new interrogation techniques on her.
[02:10:00.208 --> 02:10:02.429]  And what were those?
[02:10:02.429 --> 02:10:07.371]  Checking her computer to see who she's been talking to, what she's been looking at, and things like that.
[02:10:07.371 --> 02:10:09.292]  Well, anybody could be Al-Qaeda.
[02:10:09.292 --> 02:10:15.334]  I remember the last time I was in the airport, there were guys sitting there reading these black and white books about how to spot a terrorist.
[02:10:15.334 --> 02:10:18.695]  I mean, it's just that the terrorists run the government!
[02:10:18.695 --> 02:10:23.457]  This is a local two-bit town, the smallest town you ever saw, and they sent him off.
[02:10:23.457 --> 02:10:25.618]  They picked him because he's one of the head
[02:10:26.451 --> 02:10:30.072]  Honchos in the Sheriff's Office to be trained in their new interrogation techniques.
[02:10:30.072 --> 02:10:36.275]  And that federal money that's our tax dollars is to federalize them all, and then they know how to sell us these FEMA camps.
[02:10:36.275 --> 02:10:38.816]  Oh, we're putting illegal aliens in them, and we're going to put U.S.
[02:10:38.816 --> 02:10:39.456]  citizens.
[02:10:39.456 --> 02:10:41.917]  Oh, well, it must be okay because they're putting illegal aliens in them.
[02:10:41.917 --> 02:10:43.478]  Whole families, folks!
[02:10:43.478 --> 02:10:45.399]  Whole families, no due process.
[02:10:45.399 --> 02:10:49.700]  Well, it's a 6-6 situation, Alex, but I just want to get to two quick things.
[02:10:49.700 --> 02:10:50.841]  I'll make it as fair as I can.
[02:10:50.841 --> 02:10:53.282]  The National Guard being trained in Iraq,
[02:10:54.330 --> 02:11:00.551]  And then now about this teaching the Iraqi people how to kill each other better, how we train them how to kill.
[02:11:00.551 --> 02:11:02.091]  Seems like they know how to kill pretty good.
[02:11:02.091 --> 02:11:04.572]  They don't really need us to train them, doesn't it?
[02:11:04.572 --> 02:11:07.172]  It's all designed to balkanize and break down the country.
[02:11:07.172 --> 02:11:08.313]  What was the other point?
[02:11:08.313 --> 02:11:14.194]  And the other point is I had sent you a green booklet, a small booklet about the truth from Afghanistan.
[02:11:14.194 --> 02:11:20.115]  And it's a historical piece written during the Soviet time, written in the Soviet Union.
[02:11:20.115 --> 02:11:21.635]  And I know you saw it and you got it.
[02:11:22.721 --> 02:11:31.423]  Well, I mean, they've admitted to all that.
[02:11:31.423 --> 02:11:34.784]  Listen, I appreciate your call, and thank you for the booklet.
[02:11:34.784 --> 02:11:37.445]  Okay, I'm not going to air the whole seven-minute piece, but this is a few nights ago.
[02:11:37.445 --> 02:11:39.246]  We're trying to get Congressman Ben O'Rourke back on.
[02:11:39.246 --> 02:11:40.206]  We had him on years ago.
[02:11:40.908 --> 02:11:44.029]  This is a big whitewash, but, oh, there were Arabs involved.
[02:11:44.029 --> 02:11:48.751]  The Republicans want to get to the truth, but Republican leadership and Democratic leadership don't want them to.
[02:11:48.751 --> 02:11:57.474]  That's because 5,000 Iraqis, trained here in the 80s by the CIA and the defense intelligence apparatchik, were brought back into the country.
[02:11:57.474 --> 02:12:00.055]  They were involved in Oklahoma City for the U.S.
[02:12:00.055 --> 02:12:02.176]  government in the diversionary blast.
[02:12:02.176 --> 02:12:04.357]  That's in my film, Road to Tyranny, made five years ago.
[02:12:05.251 --> 02:12:07.335]  I've got local police surveillance tape of them.
[02:12:07.335 --> 02:12:08.818]  We know their names.
[02:12:08.818 --> 02:12:12.945]  People who brought this forward were sued and then won their lawsuits in court against those suing them.
[02:12:12.945 --> 02:12:14.788]  This has been vetted.
[02:12:14.788 --> 02:12:15.590]  Okay?
[02:12:15.590 --> 02:12:15.890]  L.A.
[02:12:15.890 --> 02:12:16.772]  Times has reported it.
[02:12:17.364 --> 02:12:21.745]  They have the surveillance tapes showing the Arabs with them.
[02:12:21.745 --> 02:12:31.289]  But why, when police arrested them trying to leave the country, and why when state police arrested them who were already surveilling them, were they not allowed to keep them and charge them?
[02:12:31.289 --> 02:12:33.269]  Because they were ordered by Bill Clinton to let them go.
[02:12:33.269 --> 02:12:35.470]  Because they work for our government.
[02:12:35.470 --> 02:12:35.950]  It's perfect.
[02:12:35.950 --> 02:12:37.411]  Our government has terrorists.
[02:12:37.411 --> 02:12:40.412]  Anytime they need to get control or get more funding, they just activate them.
[02:12:40.412 --> 02:12:41.712]  And if they happen to get caught,
[02:12:42.561 --> 02:12:46.424]  They can then just say, oh look, it's an Arab, don't believe him, he's an Iraqi.
[02:12:46.424 --> 02:12:48.125]  Very, very slick.
[02:12:48.125 --> 02:12:51.807]  But still the truth is percolating out despite their whitewashes.
[02:12:51.807 --> 02:12:56.150]  So here's their whitewash that you can read a million words between the lines.
[02:12:56.150 --> 02:12:57.151]  Here it is.
[02:12:57.151 --> 02:13:02.615]  Now to a new report on the bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City 11 and a half years ago now.
[02:13:03.215 --> 02:13:08.917]  A congressional subcommittee is blasting the Justice Department and the FBI for mishandling the case.
[02:13:08.917 --> 02:13:11.518]  American Morning, this is Bob Franken, live in Washington with more.
[02:13:11.518 --> 02:13:12.218]  Good morning, Bob.
[02:13:12.218 --> 02:13:12.838]  Good morning, Miles.
[02:13:12.838 --> 02:13:26.163]  Well, this report covers a lot of ground, but it doesn't break much ground, and the explanation for that, according to the congressman who led the investigation, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, is that he had a very small staff and a real lack of cooperation.
[02:13:28.547 --> 02:13:32.810]  It's been more than a decade since the second worst terrorist attack on U.S.
[02:13:32.810 --> 02:13:33.551]  soil.
[02:13:33.551 --> 02:13:41.197]  The conspiracy theories began almost immediately after 168 people were killed in the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:13:41.197 --> 02:13:46.021]  Did Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols act alone or were others involved?
[02:13:46.021 --> 02:13:47.582]  Was every lead hunted down?
[02:13:48.439 --> 02:13:55.003]  This new report by a House International Relations Subcommittee does not conclude there was foreign involvement.
[02:13:55.003 --> 02:14:07.692]  It does charge that federal investigators did not fully pursue those possibilities, which have been raised since day one, when some witnesses, for instance, claimed to have spotted a so-called John Doe number two.
[02:14:08.487 --> 02:14:12.811]  The FBI discarded those theories years ago, citing a lack of evidence.
[02:14:12.811 --> 02:14:20.980]  But, it is reasonable to question, says the report, if all leads were thoroughly pursued, all evidence gathered, and properly analyzed.
[02:14:21.664 --> 02:14:44.405]  The report does not question whether McVeigh and Nichols were the ones primarily responsible for the bombings, but concludes the McVeigh execution should have been further delayed while investigators continued to delve into possibilities of involvement by terrorists associated with the New York World Trade Center bombing in 1993, as well as neo-Nazi groups, including a German national.
[02:14:44.925 --> 02:14:52.912]  While federal officials would not be interviewed, an FBI response contended every bit of information was investigated and reviewed.
[02:14:52.912 --> 02:14:56.475]  The FBI worked tirelessly to cover all leads.
[02:14:56.475 --> 02:15:11.228]  But the outgoing chairman of the subcommittee, Republican Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, says his own two-year investigation, more than ten years after the deadly blast, was hamstrung by a lack of cooperation and his subcommittee's very limited resources.
[02:15:12.704 --> 02:15:19.087]  At the end of this report, Miles, we're left with the same unanswered questions that have existed for such a long time.
[02:15:19.087 --> 02:15:20.708]  And, of course, there's one more question.
[02:15:20.708 --> 02:15:22.209]  Why are they still unanswered?
[02:15:22.209 --> 02:15:22.649]  Miles?
[02:15:22.649 --> 02:15:24.230]  Good question, Bob Franken.
[02:15:24.230 --> 02:15:31.514]  Let's put it right to the outgoing chairman of the subcommittee, Republican Congressman Dana Boerbacher, joining us from Santa Ana, California.
[02:15:32.274 --> 02:15:34.255]  Congressman Rohrabacher, good to have you with us.
[02:15:34.255 --> 02:15:36.216]  Hope you're having a good break.
[02:15:36.216 --> 02:15:37.096]  Hang in ten a little bit.
[02:15:37.096 --> 02:15:38.516]  I know you're a big surfer out there.
[02:15:38.516 --> 02:15:40.097]  Well, it's a little early out here.
[02:15:40.097 --> 02:15:42.298]  Yeah, I know, and we appreciate you getting up early for us.
[02:15:42.298 --> 02:15:44.839]  Alright, this... you didn't get very far in this report.
[02:15:44.839 --> 02:15:45.599]  Was it a waste of time?
[02:15:46.781 --> 02:16:00.025]  Well, it wasn't a waste of time considering the magnitude of the crime and the relationship that it may have to the terrorist threat that we face today and that, of course, we experienced on 9-11.
[02:16:00.025 --> 02:16:07.208]  So we did, while we didn't come to the conclusion and that we had proven a foreign connection,
[02:16:07.828 --> 02:16:22.185]  We have at least broken some new ground by analyzing the FBI and Justice Department original investigation and perhaps some of the deficiencies there that led
[02:16:22.985 --> 02:16:25.046]  They could possibly have led to 9-11.
[02:16:25.046 --> 02:16:26.667]  Well, you know, it's interesting, though.
[02:16:26.667 --> 02:16:31.850]  You raise a lot of questions that are just kind of out there in the conspiracy theorist world.
[02:16:31.850 --> 02:16:37.853]  That McVeigh called a German citizen who was living in a white supremacist compound.
[02:16:37.853 --> 02:16:40.375]  Another man was seen with McVeigh, that John Doe No.
[02:16:40.375 --> 02:16:41.455]  2 story.
[02:16:41.455 --> 02:16:44.577]  A group of neo-Nazi bank robbers may have been tied to McVeigh.
[02:16:44.577 --> 02:16:48.319]  Persons associated with Middle East terrorism in the Philippines might have contacted Nichols.
[02:16:48.319 --> 02:16:50.580]  An Iraqi national happened to be in Oklahoma City.
[02:16:50.580 --> 02:16:51.301]  All these things
[02:16:51.921 --> 02:16:53.162]  It's been out there.
[02:16:53.162 --> 02:16:54.703]  It's raised once again in the report.
[02:16:54.703 --> 02:16:57.886]  Doesn't this just add more fuel to those conspiracy theories?
[02:16:58.957 --> 02:17:03.982]  Well, there's nothing wrong to add to a conspiracy theory when there might be a conspiracy, in fact.
[02:17:03.982 --> 02:17:07.806]  The public needs to understand.
[02:17:07.806 --> 02:17:10.448]  Let me give an example, a specific example.
[02:17:10.448 --> 02:17:17.655]  John Doe, too, was someone who was allegedly with Timothy McDade the day of the bombing.
[02:17:17.655 --> 02:17:23.221]  There are numerous witnesses that suggest they saw Timothy McDade with another person that day.
[02:17:23.861 --> 02:17:32.949]  When he rented the Ryder truck that was used in the bombing, the man who rented the truck to him insists that there was someone with McVeigh.
[02:17:32.949 --> 02:17:37.373]  Someone who delivered a pizza to McVeigh's room that night.
[02:17:37.373 --> 02:17:42.018]  Someone else, other than McVeigh, answered the door to his motel.
[02:17:42.018 --> 02:17:48.583]  The bottom line is, someone was with him and that person has not been identified, and the FBI called off
[02:17:49.424 --> 02:17:53.187]  Okay, you can watch the whole video up on PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:17:53.187 --> 02:17:54.187]  There's like three more minutes.
[02:18:18.929 --> 02:18:19.750]  We know.
[02:18:19.750 --> 02:18:23.133]  FBI agents told the LA Times they saw the surveillance camera tapes.
[02:18:23.133 --> 02:18:24.374]  There's 12 of them.
[02:18:24.374 --> 02:18:27.096]  It shows McVeigh with three different Arabs.
[02:18:27.096 --> 02:18:29.518]  It shows him getting out of the car with one.
[02:18:29.518 --> 02:18:36.024]  That man is identified by the State Police Intelligence Unit as Al Hussein Hussein and the Oklahoma City Intelligence Unit.
[02:18:36.024 --> 02:18:39.407]  We have the Police Surveillance Unit video!
[02:18:40.465 --> 02:18:45.068]  Okay, I've got video of these guys running around there in Oklahoma City.
[02:18:45.068 --> 02:18:47.090]  It's in Road to Tyranny.
[02:18:47.090 --> 02:18:51.172]  45 minutes of the three-hour film is about Oklahoma City.
[02:18:51.172 --> 02:18:59.558]  The FBI cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, gave them the detonators in 93, and then told the people below them not to bust them and let it go forward.
[02:18:59.558 --> 02:19:00.679]  So there they provocateured it.
[02:19:01.758 --> 02:19:14.842]  With Oklahoma City, they had Arabs trained by our government in the 80s, by name, we know who they are, on our government's payroll, with sheep dipped McVeigh, running around, creating this history, this ledger, with every group under the sun.
[02:19:14.842 --> 02:19:24.365]  It was obviously a bigger plan to try to link them up to white supremacists, to move against those groups, when really it was Arabic in nature, but Arabic controlled by our government.
[02:19:24.365 --> 02:19:30.787]  And we've had state police officers, we've had Colonel Craig Roberts on, they killed cops who tried to investigate this, cop of the year,
[02:19:31.647 --> 02:19:36.230]  Terrence Yakey in Oklahoma City was there taking people out of the building.
[02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:37.891]  Just, I mean, I could go on for hours about it.
[02:19:37.891 --> 02:19:42.595]  I've made two films on the subject that cover Oklahoma City.
[02:19:42.595 --> 02:19:45.777]  And, uh, you know, talk about the FBI never covering anything up.
[02:19:45.777 --> 02:19:48.439]  They won't release those videotapes.
[02:19:48.439 --> 02:19:50.520]  There have been two separate lawsuits trying to get them.
[02:19:51.846 --> 02:19:56.229]  Why didn't you use those videotapes in the trial in Denver?
[02:19:56.229 --> 02:20:01.674]  If you've got McVeigh getting out of the car, you've got your proof, why won't they use those tapes?
[02:20:01.674 --> 02:20:09.580]  Because it shows them with an Iraqi man from every angle you could imagine.
[02:20:09.580 --> 02:20:11.421]  That's why.
[02:20:11.421 --> 02:20:13.583]  That's why.
[02:20:13.583 --> 02:20:17.246]  And they got these terrorists in every city right now ready to level this country.
[02:20:17.867 --> 02:20:21.328]  And they'll march the troops in after they do it, to be your savior.
[02:20:21.328 --> 02:20:24.288]  Now we expose this, we can save the country!
[02:20:24.288 --> 02:20:26.629]  That's what I'm doing here!
[02:20:26.629 --> 02:20:29.089]  Tons of news, an update from the FEMA camp straight ahead.
[02:20:29.089 --> 02:20:32.910]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[02:20:32.910 --> 02:20:33.570]  One and the same.
[02:20:41.070 --> 02:20:45.073]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%, in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:20:45.073 --> 02:20:47.154]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:20:47.154 --> 02:20:47.694]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:20:47.694 --> 02:20:49.476]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:20:49.476 --> 02:20:49.956]  Here is reality.
[02:20:49.956 --> 02:20:51.997]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:21:06.827 --> 02:21:11.049]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:21:11.049 --> 02:21:15.210]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.

[02:21:33.698 --> 02:21:35.638]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:21:35.638 --> 02:21:36.259]  What?
[02:21:36.259 --> 02:21:37.019]  Again?
[02:21:37.019 --> 02:21:38.719]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:21:38.719 --> 02:21:43.361]  Honey, let's stop because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[02:21:43.361 --> 02:21:44.881]  Why did you do that?
[02:21:44.881 --> 02:21:50.943]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:21:50.943 --> 02:21:52.104]  Are we there yet?
[02:21:52.104 --> 02:21:53.424]  for the entire trip.
[02:21:53.424 --> 02:21:55.585]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:21:56.085 --> 02:21:57.387]  Great idea!
[02:21:57.387 --> 02:22:00.330]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids!
[02:22:00.330 --> 02:22:07.679]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle, and using our Berkey Sport Bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.

[02:22:08.812 --> 02:22:10.433]  You're terrific!
[02:22:10.433 --> 02:22:12.033]  Oh honey, so are you!
[02:22:12.033 --> 02:22:15.734]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[02:22:15.734 --> 02:22:17.015]  Now can we stop?
[02:22:17.015 --> 02:22:18.055]  I need to go too.

[02:22:34.543 --> 02:22:40.312]  Did you know that the mother of all secret societies, the Illuminati, worships Lucifer, better known as Satan the Devil?
[02:22:41.315 --> 02:22:49.577]  Did you know that they are the individuals giving rise to the final world social system described in Revelation Chapter 13?
[02:22:49.577 --> 02:22:54.778]  Did you know they were the founders of international communism to be the seen enemy of Christianity?
[02:22:54.778 --> 02:23:01.299]  To be used to destroy America so that we could be merged into an all-powerful one-world government?

[02:23:42.380 --> 02:23:48.105]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served, or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[02:23:48.505 --> 02:23:56.273]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who spend their lives protecting our freedom, and to those who have lost their lives doing so.

[02:24:39.539 --> 02:24:47.365]  Kevin Smith, Aaron Dykes, work here at the InfoWars office, are both on the ground at the admitted relocation FEMA camp for illegal aliens and U.S.
[02:24:47.365 --> 02:24:51.388]  citizens, part of a new program building these nationwide for whole families.
[02:24:51.388 --> 02:24:53.269]  They've been told multiple times to turn their cameras off.
[02:24:53.269 --> 02:24:57.412]  There's been open discussions of taking their videotapes and quote, reviewing them.
[02:24:57.412 --> 02:25:00.875]  In America, they're not on the prison complex, FEMA camp property.
[02:25:01.295 --> 02:25:02.836]  Police are driving back and forth now.
[02:25:02.836 --> 02:25:07.759]  Some other people have showed up to, I guess, protest or also to observe.
[02:25:07.759 --> 02:25:11.641]  Let's go straight to Kevin Smith, north of Austin, at a FEMA camp.
[02:25:11.641 --> 02:25:14.142]  Kevin Smith, please continue.
[02:25:14.142 --> 02:25:21.386]  Hey Alex, you know, when we can't depend on the organized left to come out and do their own protest, you put out the word and we get InfoWarriors to show up.
[02:25:21.386 --> 02:25:23.247]  So, we just had three vehicles
[02:25:23.949 --> 02:25:27.931]  Uh, pull up with some of, uh, the Info Wars, uh, and here comes the fourth.
[02:25:27.931 --> 02:25:29.291]  Here comes another one.
[02:25:29.291 --> 02:25:30.192]  Looks like another one.
[02:25:30.192 --> 02:25:32.112]  We're gonna have us a bit of a protest here.
[02:25:32.112 --> 02:25:34.593]  So, yeah, we're starting to get the Taylor PD.
[02:25:34.593 --> 02:25:39.555]  It's now doing a little drive back and forth on this farm and market or county road that we're on.
[02:25:39.555 --> 02:25:43.197]  And there's been an unmarked vehicle, so we'll see how it goes.
[02:25:43.197 --> 02:25:44.177]  Um, I don't know.
[02:25:46.030 --> 02:25:53.075]  Well, I mean, the prison and federal ICE guards have tried to tell you to turn your cameras off, but you haven't.
[02:25:53.075 --> 02:25:55.617]  I wonder if the Taylor PD will try it.
[02:25:55.617 --> 02:26:02.681]  Well, the InfoWars people showing up right now have their own cameras, so we definitely have enough cameras to cover the event.
[02:26:02.681 --> 02:26:07.725]  So, we'll see how it goes, and we'll start asking some of these people why they thought it was important to come out.
[02:26:07.725 --> 02:26:09.746]  But right now, they're just watching us.
[02:26:09.746 --> 02:26:13.189]  They haven't done anything too menacing as of late.
[02:26:13.189 --> 02:26:14.269]  But we are here.
[02:26:14.269 --> 02:26:15.190]  We want to see the kids.
[02:26:15.706 --> 02:26:18.333]  Come out into the yard, which is what it is.
[02:26:18.333 --> 02:26:22.665]  High security fence playground, so we'll definitely be here for that.
[02:26:22.665 --> 02:26:23.948]  Anything else you want from me right now?
[02:26:24.794 --> 02:26:26.295]  Just a basic recap.
[02:26:26.295 --> 02:26:29.318]  They told you to not aim cameras, turn your cameras off.
[02:26:29.318 --> 02:26:32.460]  You heard open discussions of are they allowed to tape us?
[02:26:32.460 --> 02:26:33.941]  Should we review their tapes?
[02:26:33.941 --> 02:26:36.924]  Don't let them touch our equipment.
[02:26:36.924 --> 02:26:37.704]  No, no, we won't.
[02:26:37.704 --> 02:26:51.015]  And when we first got here, we just went ahead and pulled into this open parking lot and that, you know, elicited a response from them and they started circling the wagons and, you know, higher levels of, you know, my manager comes out and then the boss comes out and
[02:26:51.537 --> 02:26:52.979]  And they take our information.
[02:26:52.979 --> 02:26:53.900]  They went back in.
[02:26:53.900 --> 02:26:57.283]  A couple of them had mentioned we might want to review what's on their film.
[02:26:57.283 --> 02:27:02.589]  They haven't came back and said anything to us about that at this point, but they're out in the parking lot watching us right now.
[02:27:02.589 --> 02:27:05.191]  So, you know, we're not doing anything wrong.
[02:27:05.191 --> 02:27:08.555]  We're standing out here on a beautiful day and filming this facility from across the street.
[02:27:09.171 --> 02:27:10.712]  And, uh, let's see what happens.
[02:27:10.712 --> 02:27:13.754]  But, uh, Taylor has just barely slowed down the PD.
[02:27:13.754 --> 02:27:15.936]  Well, more folks will show up.
[02:27:15.936 --> 02:27:17.917]  More folks will show up there in downtown Taylor.
[02:27:17.917 --> 02:27:19.678]  Stay about an hour and a half and come back.
[02:27:19.678 --> 02:27:21.219]  Let's get a report out.
[02:27:21.219 --> 02:27:25.742]  Let's get this out on the web by tonight, uh, for the PrisonPlanet.tv folks.
[02:27:25.742 --> 02:27:33.128]  Thank you, Kevin, and if anything develops in the next 30 minutes of broadcast time, the next 33 minutes of broadcast time, call back in, okay?
[02:27:33.128 --> 02:27:34.108]  I'll sure do it.
[02:27:34.108 --> 02:27:34.588]  Thank you.
[02:27:34.588 --> 02:27:38.131]  Let me take this time out before we break and come back and play this Twilight Zone clip.
[02:27:38.897 --> 02:27:43.059]  That really illustrates, you know, what the whole New World Order is all about.
[02:27:43.059 --> 02:27:49.643]  Rod Serling, great paratrooper patriot of World War II that wrote it, the obsolete man.

[02:29:49.408 --> 02:29:59.277]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[02:29:59.277 --> 02:30:00.197]  We can win this thing.
[02:30:00.197 --> 02:30:01.258]  What they're doing is wrong.
[02:30:01.258 --> 02:30:02.439]  What they're doing is evil.
[02:30:02.439 --> 02:30:03.720]  They're destroying this country.
[02:30:03.720 --> 02:30:05.802]  They're enemies of this republic.
[02:30:05.802 --> 02:30:06.763]  A man in the right
[02:30:08.695 --> 02:30:12.219]  Can take down somebody in the wrong any day of the week.
[02:30:12.219 --> 02:30:13.860]  You just gotta be willing to fight.
[02:30:13.860 --> 02:30:16.723]  We're fighting in the front lines of the Info War.
[02:30:16.723 --> 02:30:21.849]  Stay with us.
[02:30:21.849 --> 02:30:23.250]  We're on the march.
[02:30:23.250 --> 02:30:25.773]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:25.773 --> 02:30:28.476]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:37.116 --> 02:30:38.677]  Currency devaluation.
[02:30:38.677 --> 02:30:39.698]  Inflation.
[02:30:39.698 --> 02:30:41.119]  One and the same.
[02:30:41.119 --> 02:30:45.121]  If you had deposited $100,000 at a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:30:45.121 --> 02:30:47.183]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:30:47.183 --> 02:30:47.743]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:30:47.743 --> 02:30:49.524]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:30:49.524 --> 02:30:50.025]  Here is reality.
[02:30:50.025 --> 02:30:52.046]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:31:06.876 --> 02:31:11.098]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:31:11.098 --> 02:31:15.279]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[02:31:15.279 --> 02:31:19.360]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:20.881]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:31:20.881 --> 02:31:21.121]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:31:31.443 --> 02:31:32.204]  It's a fact.
[02:31:32.204 --> 02:31:37.108]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:31:37.108 --> 02:31:42.593]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[02:31:42.593 --> 02:31:46.036]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[02:31:46.036 --> 02:31:53.142]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[02:31:53.502 --> 02:32:01.129]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[02:32:01.129 --> 02:32:03.431]  We also do credit restoration.
[02:32:03.431 --> 02:32:11.819]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt instead of living each day in fear.
[02:32:12.199 --> 02:32:14.100]  It's time to turn your life around.
[02:32:14.100 --> 02:32:16.721]  Call Day of Jubilee open 9 a.m.
[02:32:16.721 --> 02:32:17.601]  to 5 p.m.
[02:32:17.601 --> 02:32:19.142]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[02:32:19.142 --> 02:32:20.563]  That's 920-293-8024 and ask for Robert.
[02:32:20.563 --> 02:32:23.604]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[02:32:32.654 --> 02:32:35.395]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:32:35.395 --> 02:32:37.817]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:32:37.817 --> 02:32:48.242]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[02:32:48.242 --> 02:32:50.563]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[02:33:40.348 --> 02:33:46.154]  I promised to play large segments of the Obsolete Man Twilight Zone episode.
[02:33:46.154 --> 02:33:50.439]  With a future totalitarian state where they're telling this guy he's obsolete.
[02:33:50.439 --> 02:33:54.223]  And he basically sets up the establishment, Judge Thug.
[02:33:54.223 --> 02:33:56.766]  We'll have time to play most of it, not all of it.
[02:33:57.755 --> 02:34:00.018]  But this is, I think, the best Twilight Zone episode.
[02:34:00.018 --> 02:34:02.741]  And this is how it is in a lot of authoritarian states.
[02:34:02.741 --> 02:34:07.186]  The establishment has decided that our free societies, our way of life is obsolete.
[02:34:07.186 --> 02:34:09.209]  And the New World Order, that's just the way it is.
[02:34:09.209 --> 02:34:10.991]  You just got to get out of the way.
[02:34:10.991 --> 02:34:12.032]  No, we're going to stand up.
[02:34:12.032 --> 02:34:13.053]  We're going to fight them.
[02:34:13.053 --> 02:34:14.355]  We're going to resist them.
[02:34:14.355 --> 02:34:16.097]  If anything develops out at the FEMA camp,
[02:34:17.572 --> 02:34:29.207]  In the next 25 minutes of broadcast airtime that's left, we will cut in to the Twilight Zone piece and go right to our people up there at the FEMA camp.
[02:34:29.207 --> 02:34:29.848]  So stay with us.
[02:34:29.848 --> 02:34:30.209]  Here it is.
[02:34:40.058 --> 02:34:42.379]  You're traveling through another dimension.
[02:34:42.379 --> 02:34:45.660]  A dimension not only of sight and sound, but of mind.
[02:34:45.660 --> 02:34:49.302]  A journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination.
[02:34:49.302 --> 02:34:50.522]  That's the signpost up ahead.
[02:34:50.522 --> 02:34:57.265]  Your next stop, the Twilight Zone.
[02:34:57.265 --> 02:35:03.688]  Wordsworth Romney obsolescence.
[02:35:03.688 --> 02:35:05.189]  He's waiting, Chancellor.
[02:35:05.189 --> 02:35:05.709]  Order him in.
[02:35:18.089 --> 02:35:21.050]  You walk into this room at your own risk.
[02:35:21.050 --> 02:35:23.211]  Because it leads to the future.
[02:35:23.211 --> 02:35:26.673]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[02:35:26.673 --> 02:35:28.914]  This is not a new world.
[02:35:28.914 --> 02:35:32.175]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[02:35:33.326 --> 02:35:41.771]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[02:35:41.771 --> 02:35:49.795]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[02:35:49.795 --> 02:35:55.539]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[02:35:55.539 --> 02:35:57.760]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[02:36:03.107 --> 02:36:05.829]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth.
[02:36:05.829 --> 02:36:12.493]  In his last 48 hours on Earth, he's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated.
[02:36:12.493 --> 02:36:17.276]  Because he's built out of flesh, and because he has a mind.
[02:36:17.276 --> 02:36:21.839]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[02:36:30.242 --> 02:36:34.424]  Wordsworth, Romney, field investigation finding obsolescence.
[02:36:34.424 --> 02:36:36.624]  Do you know why you're here, Mr. Wordsworth?
[02:36:36.624 --> 02:36:37.365]  Yes, sir.
[02:36:37.365 --> 02:36:39.606]  I'd ask you to speak up a little, if you will.
[02:36:39.606 --> 02:36:41.766]  Yes, sir, I know why I'm here.
[02:36:41.766 --> 02:36:46.308]  You've been under investigation, Mr. Wordsworth, for the mandatory period of one year and eleven months.
[02:36:46.308 --> 02:36:47.709]  You're found to be obsolete.
[02:36:47.709 --> 02:36:51.130]  The purpose of this hearing is to make a finding in the matter and make a sentence accordingly.
[02:36:51.130 --> 02:36:51.990]  Do you understand that?
[02:36:51.990 --> 02:36:54.071]  Yes, I understand that.
[02:36:54.071 --> 02:36:57.753]  Your occupation, Mr. Wordsworth?
[02:36:57.753 --> 02:36:58.733]  A librarian, sir.
[02:37:04.156 --> 02:37:05.657]  Of what?
[02:37:05.657 --> 02:37:08.880]  A librarian, sir.
[02:37:08.880 --> 02:37:10.181]  Has this man had counsel?
[02:37:10.181 --> 02:37:10.802]  Yes, sir, he has.
[02:37:10.802 --> 02:37:11.863]  Are you sure he knows his rights?
[02:37:11.863 --> 02:37:15.145]  He's been given orientation, sir.
[02:37:15.145 --> 02:37:22.291]  Mr. Wordsworth, I'm told that you've had counsel... Stand back in the light, Mr. Wordsworth!
[02:37:22.291 --> 02:37:30.278]  I'm told you've had counsel and been given orientation, Mr. Wordsworth, but I'm still not sure in my own mind that you understand the purpose of this hearing.
[02:37:30.982 --> 02:37:35.487]  The field investigators in your sector have classified you as obsolete.
[02:37:35.487 --> 02:37:38.049]  This finding carries with it serious implications.
[02:37:38.049 --> 02:37:42.454]  Do you understand that, Mr. Wordsworth?
[02:37:42.454 --> 02:37:44.376]  Now I ask you again, your occupation?
[02:37:45.976 --> 02:37:47.797]  I am a librarian, sir.
[02:37:47.797 --> 02:37:49.017]  That is my occupation.
[02:37:49.017 --> 02:37:50.377]  That is my profession.
[02:37:50.377 --> 02:37:54.378]  If you people choose to call that obsolete... Request clarification of the term?
[02:37:54.378 --> 02:37:55.199]  Yes.
[02:37:55.199 --> 02:37:56.819]  The term, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:37:56.819 --> 02:37:57.679]  You people.
[02:37:57.679 --> 02:37:59.260]  You make reference to the state?
[02:37:59.260 --> 02:38:00.880]  I make reference to the state.
[02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:04.081]  And you persisted declaring your occupation as being that of a librarian.
[02:38:04.081 --> 02:38:04.761]  Is that correct?
[02:38:04.761 --> 02:38:06.302]  That is correct, sir.
[02:38:06.302 --> 02:38:10.023]  A librarian.
[02:38:10.023 --> 02:38:13.844]  Having to do... with books.
[02:38:15.745 --> 02:38:16.606]  Yes, sir.
[02:38:16.606 --> 02:38:19.969]  Books.
[02:38:19.969 --> 02:38:25.193]  Since there are no more books, Mr. Wordsworth, there are no more libraries.
[02:38:25.193 --> 02:38:30.177]  And of course it follows that there is very little call for the services of a librarian.
[02:38:30.177 --> 02:38:32.679]  Case in point, a minister.
[02:38:32.679 --> 02:38:38.344]  A minister would tell us that his function is that of preaching the word of God.
[02:38:38.344 --> 02:38:42.067]  And of course it follows that since the state has proven that there is no God,
[02:38:42.757 --> 02:38:46.480]  That would make the function of a minister somewhat academic as well.
[02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:51.523]  There is a God!
[02:38:51.523 --> 02:38:55.245]  You are in error, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:38:55.245 --> 02:38:59.248]  There is no God!
[02:38:59.248 --> 02:39:02.690]  The state has proven that there is no God!
[02:39:02.690 --> 02:39:09.355]  You cannot erase God with an edict!
[02:39:09.355 --> 02:39:11.276]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:39:11.824 --> 02:39:12.645]  A lie!
[02:39:12.645 --> 02:39:14.646]  No man is obsolete!
[02:39:14.646 --> 02:39:16.527]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth!
[02:39:16.527 --> 02:39:19.770]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[02:39:19.770 --> 02:39:25.194]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[02:39:25.194 --> 02:39:26.895]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[02:39:26.895 --> 02:39:28.416]  A crawling insect!
[02:39:28.416 --> 02:39:33.079]  An ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[02:39:33.079 --> 02:39:34.580]  I am a human being!
[02:39:34.580 --> 02:39:37.002]  You're a librarian, Mr. Wordsworth!
[02:39:37.737 --> 02:39:47.463]  You're a dealer in books and two-cent fines and pamphlets and closed stacks and the musty insides of a language factory that spews out meaningless words on an assembly line.
[02:39:47.463 --> 02:40:00.730]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind, like a vacuum that you may believe has an existence by sprinkling index numbers on little cards.
[02:40:00.730 --> 02:40:01.871]  I don't care.
[02:40:01.871 --> 02:40:03.432]  I tell you, I don't care.
[02:40:03.432 --> 02:40:04.473]  I'm a human being.
[02:40:04.473 --> 02:40:04.953]  I exist.
[02:40:06.034 --> 02:40:07.583]  And if I speak one thought aloud...
[02:40:08.439 --> 02:40:09.979]  That thought lives!
[02:40:09.979 --> 02:40:12.220]  Even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[02:40:12.220 --> 02:40:15.320]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:20.121]  Delusions that you inject into your veins with printer's ink!
[02:40:20.121 --> 02:40:22.882]  The narcotics that you call literature!
[02:40:22.882 --> 02:40:24.342]  The Bible!
[02:40:24.342 --> 02:40:25.502]  Poetry!
[02:40:25.502 --> 02:40:26.983]  Essays of all kind!
[02:40:26.983 --> 02:40:32.424]  All that it opiates to make you think you have a strength when you have no strength at all!
[02:40:32.424 --> 02:40:35.384]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream!
[02:40:35.384 --> 02:40:37.805]  And the state has no use for your kind!
[02:40:44.170 --> 02:40:48.711]  You waste our time, Mr. Wordsworth, and you're not worth the waste.
[02:40:48.711 --> 02:40:50.151]  Instruct him.
[02:40:50.151 --> 02:40:53.452]  Romney Wordsworth, step back to await the finding of this board.
[02:40:53.452 --> 02:40:57.113]  Yes, sir.
[02:40:57.113 --> 02:41:01.933]  How do you find, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:41:01.933 --> 02:41:02.714]  Obsolete.
[02:41:02.714 --> 02:41:03.374]  Obsolete.
[02:41:03.374 --> 02:41:04.614]  Obsolete.
[02:41:04.614 --> 02:41:05.514]  Obsolete.
[02:41:05.514 --> 02:41:07.915]  I concur.
[02:41:07.915 --> 02:41:09.595]  Romney Wordsworth, step forward.
[02:41:12.918 --> 02:41:18.362]  The board finds you obsolete.
[02:41:18.362 --> 02:41:22.304]  Your rights are as follows, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:41:22.304 --> 02:41:30.210]  You are to be liquidated within a period of 48 hours, but you have an option as to method and precise time.
[02:41:30.210 --> 02:41:33.512]  There are several prescribed methods, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:41:33.512 --> 02:41:36.514]  Pills, gas, electrocution,
[02:41:38.078 --> 02:41:49.120]  And it can be done immediately or an hour from now or any specific time that you request.
[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:51.701]  I'm a very rich man.
[02:41:51.701 --> 02:41:53.801]  Louder!
[02:41:53.801 --> 02:41:56.582]  I merely said that I was a very rich man.
[02:41:56.582 --> 02:42:02.743]  I have such a luxury of choices that I choose the following.
[02:42:02.743 --> 02:42:07.784]  To be given an assassin to whom I shall tell the method of my execution.
[02:42:08.860 --> 02:42:11.761]  This is unheard of!
[02:42:11.761 --> 02:42:15.882]  Mr. Wordsworth, we don't understand the nature of the request.
[02:42:15.882 --> 02:42:22.623]  Simply that you are to assign me my assassin, but only he and I will know the way that I'm to die.
[02:42:22.623 --> 02:42:29.625]  That will be acceptable, Mr. Wordsworth, provided your liquidation is accomplished within the 48-hour period.
[02:42:29.625 --> 02:42:32.986]  Just one final request.
[02:42:32.986 --> 02:42:33.986]  I should like to die
[02:42:35.035 --> 02:42:37.877]  With an audience.
[02:42:37.877 --> 02:42:39.938]  Ah, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:42:39.938 --> 02:42:43.740]  That can be arranged indeed.
[02:42:43.740 --> 02:42:47.142]  It's not unusual that we televise executions.
[02:42:47.142 --> 02:42:50.504]  It has an educative effect on the population.
[02:42:50.504 --> 02:42:52.405]  I have no doubt.
[02:42:52.405 --> 02:42:56.847]  Now, as to the time of the liquidation, Mr. Wordsworth?
[02:42:56.847 --> 02:42:58.969]  Midnight tomorrow.
[02:42:58.969 --> 02:43:00.710]  And the place?
[02:43:00.710 --> 02:43:01.390]  In my room.
[02:43:03.524 --> 02:43:07.428]  Agreed, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:43:07.428 --> 02:43:11.572]  We will choose your liquidator and send him over to you.
[02:43:11.572 --> 02:43:18.538]  He will be duty-bound, just as you prescribed, not to divulge the method you've decided upon.
[02:43:18.538 --> 02:43:20.660]  That will be all, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:43:20.660 --> 02:43:22.482]  You may leave and return to your room.
[02:43:34.315 --> 02:43:37.317]  An odd one, and with very bizarre requests.
[02:43:37.317 --> 02:43:39.939]  Bizarre, yes, but to our advantage.
[02:43:39.939 --> 02:43:45.543]  We'll show the people how this obsolete man, this librarian, dies.
[02:44:15.154 --> 02:44:19.557]  Come in, Chancellor.
[02:44:19.557 --> 02:44:21.439]  Thank you for coming.
[02:44:21.439 --> 02:44:23.820]  Very irregular, Mr. Winsworth.
[02:44:23.820 --> 02:44:26.342]  Do you know why I've come?
[02:44:26.342 --> 02:44:27.603]  Do you?
[02:44:27.603 --> 02:44:29.104]  Well, I invited you.
[02:44:29.104 --> 02:44:31.446]  By all means, you invited me.
[02:44:31.446 --> 02:44:33.388]  But why would I honor such an invitation?
[02:44:33.388 --> 02:44:38.832]  A cryptic note from a condemned man asking me to visit him in the last hours of his life.
[02:44:38.832 --> 02:44:40.213]  Hardly the norm, Mr. Winsworth.
[02:44:40.213 --> 02:44:41.774]  Hardly what I'm accustomed to.
[02:44:44.537 --> 02:44:48.140]  And somewhat suspect, too.
[02:44:48.140 --> 02:44:54.526]  How do I know I wasn't invited here for that last pitiful gesture of vengeance on the part of the condemned?
[02:44:54.526 --> 02:44:56.607]  Yes.
[02:44:56.607 --> 02:45:00.030]  I'm somewhat responsible for the finding in your case.
[02:45:00.030 --> 02:45:06.416]  Your demise in less than an hour can be attributed at least in part to my decision.
[02:45:09.804 --> 02:45:11.685]  I'll tell you why I came, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:45:11.685 --> 02:45:13.906]  Perhaps to prove something to you.
[02:45:13.906 --> 02:45:14.527]  And that is?
[02:45:14.527 --> 02:45:17.588]  To prove to you that the state has no fears.
[02:45:17.588 --> 02:45:19.510]  None at all.
[02:45:19.510 --> 02:45:23.732]  You know, you will forgive me, Chancellor, but that has all the elements of a joke.
[02:45:23.732 --> 02:45:28.675]  I mean, you come to my room to prove that the state isn't afraid of me?
[02:45:28.675 --> 02:45:36.259]  What an incredible burden I must be to have to prove that the state isn't afraid of an obsolete librarian like myself.
[02:45:36.259 --> 02:45:37.640]  Now, I'll tell you the reason you came.
[02:45:38.596 --> 02:45:41.558]  I'll tell you the reason, though you won't admit it to yourself.
[02:45:41.558 --> 02:45:43.139]  Now it's my turn to ask.
[02:45:43.139 --> 02:45:44.860]  What might that be?
[02:45:44.860 --> 02:45:47.582]  I don't fit your formulae.
[02:45:47.582 --> 02:45:51.644]  Somewhere along the line, there's been a deviation from the norm.
[02:45:51.644 --> 02:45:55.507]  Your state has everything categorized, indexed, tagged.
[02:45:55.507 --> 02:45:56.887]  You are the strength.
[02:45:56.887 --> 02:45:59.049]  People like me are the weakness.
[02:45:59.049 --> 02:46:01.390]  You control and order and dictate.
[02:46:01.390 --> 02:46:03.932]  And my kind merely follow and obey.
[02:46:05.106 --> 02:46:06.367]  But something's gone wrong, hasn't it?
[02:46:06.367 --> 02:46:07.368]  I don't fit.
[02:46:07.368 --> 02:46:07.588]  Do I?
[02:46:07.588 --> 02:46:09.750]  Yes, you fit, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:46:09.750 --> 02:46:12.932]  In a few moments, you'll be cringing and pleading, just like they all do.
[02:46:12.932 --> 02:46:15.334]  Oh, yes, indeed, you fit.
[02:46:15.334 --> 02:46:19.537]  You've got a worthless, miserable little life, but you've also got an instinct for survival.
[02:46:19.537 --> 02:46:28.924]  And in a few minutes, when you feel life slipping away, when you feel that your survival is just a question of minutes, we'll see then which is the stronger, Mr. Wordsworth, the State or the Librarian.
[02:46:33.254 --> 02:46:36.737]  I take it you've had a talk with whoever's assigned your liquidation?
[02:46:36.737 --> 02:46:39.159]  Yes, I have indeed.
[02:46:39.159 --> 02:46:40.961]  Midnight, isn't it?
[02:46:40.961 --> 02:46:42.782]  Yes, in about 40 minutes.
[02:46:42.782 --> 02:46:46.345]  See, they brought this equipment here early this afternoon.
[02:46:46.345 --> 02:46:50.128]  There's two men put that up in less than 15 minutes.
[02:46:50.128 --> 02:46:52.230]  It's remote control.
[02:46:52.230 --> 02:46:56.053]  Very efficient.
[02:46:56.053 --> 02:46:57.655]  Well, we're being televised now.
[02:46:58.467 --> 02:47:01.610]  It's not unusual that we televise executions, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:47:01.610 --> 02:47:05.995]  Last year in the mass executions, we televised around the clock.
[02:47:05.995 --> 02:47:09.439]  1,300 people were put to death in less than six hours.
[02:47:09.439 --> 02:47:11.000]  You never learn, do you?
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.103]  History teaches you nothing.
[02:47:13.103 --> 02:47:15.045]  On the contrary, history teaches us a great deal.
[02:47:15.822 --> 02:47:19.803]  We had predecessors, Mr. Wordsworth, who had the beginnings of the right idea.
[02:47:19.803 --> 02:47:20.163]  Yes.
[02:47:20.163 --> 02:47:20.483]  Hitler.
[02:47:20.483 --> 02:47:21.343]  Hitler, of course.
[02:47:21.343 --> 02:47:21.743]  Stalin.
[02:47:21.743 --> 02:47:22.723]  Stalin, too.
[02:47:22.723 --> 02:47:24.424]  But their era was not one of excess.
[02:47:24.424 --> 02:47:27.144]  It was simply not going far enough.
[02:47:27.144 --> 02:47:31.965]  Too many undesirables were left around, and undesirables eventually form a core of resistance.
[02:47:31.965 --> 02:47:35.686]  Old people, for example, clutch at the past and won't accept the new.
[02:47:35.686 --> 02:47:38.146]  The sick, the maimed, and the deformed.
[02:47:38.146 --> 02:47:40.307]  They fasten onto the healthy body and damage it.
[02:47:40.307 --> 02:47:42.127]  So we eliminate them.
[02:47:43.183 --> 02:47:51.180]  And people like yourself, they can perform no useful function for the state, so... we put an end to them.
[02:47:51.180 --> 02:47:52.864]  What a charming room you have, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:47:54.991 --> 02:47:56.553]  Yes, over 20 years.
[02:47:56.553 --> 02:47:58.354]  I built that furniture myself.
[02:47:58.354 --> 02:48:00.916]  Yes, so I understand, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:48:00.916 --> 02:48:04.518]  That incidentally has kept you alive, that particular talent.
[02:48:04.518 --> 02:48:10.302]  Carpentry, you see, is a skill, and the state provides considerable leeway for people who possess certain skills.
[02:48:10.302 --> 02:48:15.666]  Unfortunately, you went as far as you could go, which was insufficient.
[02:48:15.666 --> 02:48:22.391]  So, in a few moments, it will be the end of a rather fruitless life, and Mr. Romney Wordsworth
[02:48:23.331 --> 02:48:29.458]  Librarian goes to his own nirvana.
[02:48:29.458 --> 02:48:31.921]  That's what they call it in your books, isn't it, Mr. Wordsworth?
[02:48:31.921 --> 02:48:37.067]  You're not facing the camera, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:48:37.067 --> 02:48:38.068]  You're cheating your audience.
[02:48:38.068 --> 02:48:40.751]  They want to see how you die.
[02:48:40.751 --> 02:48:42.213]  Please, Mr. Wordsworth, turn around.
[02:48:42.213 --> 02:48:43.614]  Face the camera.
[02:48:43.614 --> 02:48:44.055]  That's right.
[02:48:45.800 --> 02:48:47.201]  And don't stifle your emotions.
[02:48:47.201 --> 02:48:49.002]  If you feel like crying, go ahead and cry.
[02:48:49.002 --> 02:48:51.744]  Or if you want to plead, plead by all means.
[02:48:51.744 --> 02:48:54.186]  Some high state official might take pity on you.
[02:48:54.186 --> 02:48:55.687]  Yes, that would please you, wouldn't it?
[02:48:55.687 --> 02:49:00.310]  A little abject hand-wringing, chest-pounding, falling down on my hands and knees.
[02:49:00.310 --> 02:49:02.711]  Sit yourself, Mr. Wedsworth.
[02:49:02.711 --> 02:49:05.773]  Unfortunately, I don't have time to be entertained by them when they do come.
[02:49:05.773 --> 02:49:10.576]  I have another appointment this evening.
[02:49:10.576 --> 02:49:10.937]  Chancellor.
[02:49:14.631 --> 02:49:16.592]  Make it brief, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:49:16.592 --> 02:49:17.872]  You have plenty of time.
[02:49:17.872 --> 02:49:18.993]  You're not going anywhere.
[02:49:18.993 --> 02:49:21.734]  How's that?
[02:49:21.734 --> 02:49:24.455]  I'm afraid I haven't been very fair with you.
[02:49:24.455 --> 02:49:27.656]  I invited you here for a very special reason.
[02:49:27.656 --> 02:49:32.158]  Would you like to know the method that I've chosen for my liquidation?
[02:49:32.158 --> 02:49:39.761]  Well, in very few moments, here in this room, a bomb is going off.
[02:49:39.761 --> 02:49:41.262]  Very thoughtful, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:49:42.967 --> 02:49:45.449]  Relatively quick and painless death.
[02:49:45.449 --> 02:49:46.269]  Yes, isn't it?
[02:49:46.269 --> 02:49:53.495]  However, knowing that you're going to be blown to smithereens in a few moments isn't the happiest thought in the world, is it?
[02:49:53.495 --> 02:49:54.395]  Is it?
[02:49:54.395 --> 02:49:56.777]  That depends on the individual, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:49:56.777 --> 02:49:57.437]  Indeed it does.
[02:49:57.437 --> 02:50:07.064]  What kind of idiocy is this, Mr. Wordsworth?
[02:50:07.064 --> 02:50:08.545]  You've locked the door.
[02:50:08.545 --> 02:50:10.326]  Oh, yes, yes, I've locked the door.
[02:50:10.326 --> 02:50:10.947]  Now, question.
[02:50:12.924 --> 02:50:19.088]  Now, how does a man react to the knowledge that he's going to be blown to bits within half an hour?
[02:50:19.088 --> 02:50:22.289]  Answer.
[02:50:22.289 --> 02:50:23.570]  That depends on the individual.
[02:50:23.570 --> 02:50:36.898]  So for myself, I'm going to sit down and read my Bible.
[02:50:36.898 --> 02:50:39.239]  It's been hidden here for over 20 years.
[02:50:39.239 --> 02:50:41.120]  It's a crime punishable by death.
[02:50:42.308 --> 02:50:46.830]  So it's the only possession that I have that has any value at all to me.
[02:50:46.830 --> 02:50:51.171]  So I'm going to just sit down and read it.
[02:50:51.171 --> 02:50:54.972]  Until the moment of my death.
[02:50:54.972 --> 02:50:58.153]  How will you spend your last moments, Chancellor?
[02:50:58.153 --> 02:50:59.234]  This is insane, Wordsworth.
[02:50:59.234 --> 02:51:05.516]  Let me out of here.
[02:51:05.516 --> 02:51:06.296]  Let me out of here!
[02:51:06.296 --> 02:51:07.016]  Someone!
[02:51:07.016 --> 02:51:07.697]  Guards!
[02:51:07.697 --> 02:51:08.097]  Someone!
[02:51:08.097 --> 02:51:09.097]  Anyone!
[02:51:09.097 --> 02:51:10.398]  You're cheating the audience.
[02:51:10.398 --> 02:51:11.518]  You're not facing the cameras.
[02:51:15.239 --> 02:51:16.740]  God, somebody down there!
[02:51:16.740 --> 02:51:18.520]  Well, there's no sense in wasting your breath.
[02:51:18.520 --> 02:51:19.121]  There's nobody there.
[02:51:19.121 --> 02:51:20.961]  That's one of the rules you made up yourself.
[02:51:20.961 --> 02:51:22.982]  Isolate the person to be liquidated.
[02:51:22.982 --> 02:51:23.762]  That's what you said.
[02:51:23.762 --> 02:51:26.463]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[02:51:26.463 --> 02:51:28.924]  I think that there's no one there, so why don't you face the camera?
[02:51:28.924 --> 02:51:29.665]  It's very important.
[02:51:29.665 --> 02:51:30.525]  You said so yourself.
[02:51:34.486 --> 02:51:38.009]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:51:38.009 --> 02:51:40.291]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:51:40.291 --> 02:51:47.938]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:51:48.621 --> 02:51:56.084]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:51:56.084 --> 02:52:07.809]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:07.809 --> 02:52:11.771]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:11.771 --> 02:52:14.032]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:14.032 --> 02:52:17.874]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:52:31.260 --> 02:52:36.063]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[02:52:36.063 --> 02:52:40.685]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[02:52:40.685 --> 02:52:46.748]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey Light Water Purifier, an LED Base, two Berkey Sport Filtration Bottles,
[02:52:47.008 --> 02:52:54.931]  The Berkey Battery Adapter, the Berkey MP Solar Charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:52:54.931 --> 02:53:11.917]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones.
[02:53:12.237 --> 02:53:12.718]  We're good to go.
[02:53:31.027 --> 02:53:36.950]  Hey ladies, if you love to shop, then visit HerbalHealer.com to browse through their online catalog.
[02:53:36.950 --> 02:53:42.572]  You'll find thousands of effective, alternative, and natural products for you and the whole family.
[02:53:42.572 --> 02:53:47.654]  Besides the amazing products you'll find, this shopping is guilt-free because you're investing in your health.
[02:53:47.674 --> 02:53:48.194]  I think so.
[02:54:08.080 --> 02:54:08.640]  I think so.
[02:54:31.693 --> 02:54:32.673]  There's somebody down there.
[02:54:32.673 --> 02:54:34.434]  Well, there's no sense in wasting your breath.
[02:54:34.434 --> 02:54:35.054]  There's nobody there.
[02:54:35.054 --> 02:54:36.895]  That's one of the rules you made up yourself.
[02:54:36.895 --> 02:54:38.896]  Isolate the person to be liquidated.
[02:54:38.896 --> 02:54:40.637]  That's what you said.
[02:54:40.637 --> 02:54:42.377]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[02:54:42.377 --> 02:54:44.838]  I think that there's no one there, so why don't you face the camera?
[02:54:44.838 --> 02:54:45.559]  It's very important.
[02:54:45.559 --> 02:54:46.499]  You said so yourself.
[02:54:46.499 --> 02:54:48.640]  I'm beginning to understand where it's from.
[02:54:48.640 --> 02:54:49.360]  Shoe on the other foot.
[02:54:49.360 --> 02:54:51.121]  That's the idea, isn't it?
[02:54:51.121 --> 02:54:57.304]  It's one thing for someone like yourself to do a little cringing and pleading, but what a choice opportunity to show a member of the state doing likewise.
[02:54:57.304 --> 02:54:59.745]  But you're insane, Wedsworth, if you think they'll let me stay here.
[02:54:59.745 --> 02:55:00.425]  They?
[02:55:01.599 --> 02:55:04.161]  I asked clarification of the term, they.
[02:55:04.161 --> 02:55:06.243]  Ah, you mean the state.
[02:55:06.243 --> 02:55:08.525]  Oh, I think they'll sit on their hands for a while.
[02:55:08.525 --> 02:55:10.687]  They wouldn't want to miss this scene.
[02:55:10.687 --> 02:55:14.590]  Besides, the act of rescue would be very demeaning to them.
[02:55:14.590 --> 02:55:19.394]  To have to break in here and rescue a high-ranking member of the state.
[02:55:19.394 --> 02:55:21.936]  To snatch him out of the soup, so to speak.
[02:55:21.936 --> 02:55:23.177]  No, I think they won't help you.
[02:55:23.177 --> 02:55:26.580]  I misjudged you, Wordsworth.
[02:55:26.580 --> 02:55:27.681]  You underestimated me.
[02:55:28.416 --> 02:55:32.179]  You wanted the whole country to see the way that a librarian dies.
[02:55:32.179 --> 02:55:36.822]  Well, let the whole country see the way an official of the state dies, too.
[02:55:36.822 --> 02:55:40.324]  Face the cameras, sharpener of the light.
[02:55:40.324 --> 02:55:46.469]  Let the whole country see the strength of the state, the resilience of the state, the courage of the state.
[02:55:46.469 --> 02:55:51.252]  Let the whole country see the way a valiant man of steel faces his death.
[02:55:51.252 --> 02:55:52.793]  You have a Nirvana coming up, too.
[02:55:52.793 --> 02:55:55.035]  Why don't you just sit down?
[02:55:55.035 --> 02:55:57.016]  We'll have a little chat.
[02:55:57.016 --> 02:55:57.757]  It's you and me.
[02:55:59.269 --> 02:56:01.711]  And a great equalizer.
[02:56:01.711 --> 02:56:05.933]  As death is a great equalizer.
[02:56:05.933 --> 02:56:08.054]  So here you have.
[02:56:08.054 --> 02:56:15.339]  Here you have this strong, handsome, uniform, be-meddled symbol of giant authority.
[02:56:15.339 --> 02:56:18.401]  And this insignificant librarian.
[02:56:18.401 --> 02:56:25.025]  That suddenly, in the eyes of God, there is precious little to distinguish us.
[02:56:32.833 --> 02:56:34.113]  We shall see what's left.
[02:56:34.113 --> 02:56:43.236]  We shall see.
[02:56:43.236 --> 02:56:47.637]  The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[02:56:47.637 --> 02:56:51.578]  He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
[02:56:51.578 --> 02:56:55.478]  He leadeth me beside the still waters.
[02:56:55.478 --> 02:56:58.199]  He restoreth my soul.
[02:56:58.199 --> 02:57:01.680]  He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
[02:57:03.098 --> 02:57:07.060]  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
[02:57:07.060 --> 02:57:11.863]  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
[02:57:11.863 --> 02:57:15.725]  I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.
[02:57:15.725 --> 02:57:19.187]  Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
[02:57:19.187 --> 02:57:24.190]  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies.
[02:57:24.190 --> 02:57:26.792]  Thou anointest my head with oil.
[02:57:26.792 --> 02:57:29.513]  My cup runneth over.
[02:57:29.513 --> 02:57:32.635]  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.
[02:57:34.272 --> 02:57:37.854]  Defend me from them that rise up against me.
[02:57:37.854 --> 02:57:40.976]  Deliver me from the workers of iniquity.
[02:57:40.976 --> 02:57:43.718]  And save me from the bloody men.
[02:57:43.718 --> 02:57:46.760]  For lo, they lie in wait for my soul.
[02:57:46.760 --> 02:57:48.301]  The mighty are gathered against me.
[02:57:48.301 --> 02:57:51.283]  Not for my transgressions.
[02:57:51.283 --> 02:57:54.645]  Not for my sins, O God.
[02:57:54.645 --> 02:57:57.988]  They run and prepare themselves without my fault.
[02:57:57.988 --> 02:58:01.010]  Await to help me and behold.
[02:58:01.010 --> 02:58:02.751]  Then therefore, O Lord God of hosts,
[02:58:07.939 --> 02:58:12.781]  The fool has said in his heart, there is no God.
[02:58:12.781 --> 02:58:16.923]  The Lord looked down... We'll have to play the last five minutes tomorrow.
[02:58:16.923 --> 02:58:18.964]  But I will near the start of the broadcast.
[02:58:18.964 --> 02:58:21.665]  You can watch it online.
[02:58:21.665 --> 02:58:24.086]  But he blows up, he freaks out.
[02:58:24.086 --> 02:58:26.247]  Rodney Wordsworth lets him go.
[02:58:26.247 --> 02:58:29.008]  He shows the cowardice in the state.
[02:58:29.008 --> 02:58:32.730]  Then of course, kills the chancellor.
[02:58:32.730 --> 02:58:34.831]  And the bomb does go off and blow up the library.
[02:58:35.549 --> 02:58:39.811]  But the message is, you can stand up against the state if you're willing to go down.
[02:58:39.811 --> 02:58:40.491]  Powerful!
[02:58:40.491 --> 02:58:45.194]  We talked to Kevin, no big updates there at the FEMA camp, but we'll have a report for you tomorrow and video tonight.
[02:58:45.194 --> 02:58:49.356]  I want to thank all the folks that showed up out there in support in Taylor.
[02:58:49.356 --> 02:58:55.359]  And another powerful transmission right here on the Alex Jones Show, coming to you via the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:55.359 --> 02:58:58.100]  I want to thank a new station, WIMS, AM 1420, that goes into Chicago.
[02:59:00.931 --> 02:59:02.632]  For picking up the broadcast.
[02:59:02.632 --> 02:59:03.592]  Just got word of that.
[02:59:03.592 --> 02:59:04.813]  Another great affiliate.
[02:59:04.813 --> 02:59:05.933]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:59:05.933 --> 02:59:07.273]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:59:07.273 --> 02:59:11.335]  God bless you all!
[02:59:11.335 --> 02:59:15.577]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[02:59:15.577 --> 02:59:16.357]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[02:59:21.787 --> 02:59:25.009]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:59:25.009 --> 02:59:28.131]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:59:28.131 --> 02:59:34.696]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[02:59:34.696 --> 02:59:42.200]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[02:59:42.200 --> 02:59:46.123]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophe.
[02:59:46.263 --> 02:59:47.024]  We're good to go.
