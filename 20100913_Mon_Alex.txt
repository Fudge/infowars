[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:30.600]  it is Monday September 13th 2010 we had him on a few weeks ago for just 30
[00:30.600 --> 00:34.120]  minutes but I've got him on for a full hour today because it's so historical
[00:34.120 --> 00:40.640]  and just smoking gun evidence of the cover-up of the government conspiracy to
[00:40.640 --> 00:47.200]  murder JFK retired FBI agent Don Adams will be joining us in the second hour
[00:47.200 --> 00:50.920]  and we'll open the phones up in the second half of that hour for your
[00:50.920 --> 00:55.360]  specific questions for him and then Mark Moreno one of the leading researchers
[00:55.360 --> 00:59.840]  exposing the fact that man-made global warming is a fraud to bring in neo-
[00:59.840 --> 01:07.840]  feudalism he'll be joining us the head author of the UN's IPCC report has come
[01:07.840 --> 01:12.760]  out and said this entire thing is a fraud and a lie the House of Cards is
[01:12.760 --> 01:17.520]  completely collapsing but the global controllers don't care they're moving
[01:17.520 --> 01:23.200]  ahead with all of the different carbon taxes and Mrs. Jackson over at the EPA
[01:23.200 --> 01:28.760]  is ramming it through it's all happening and if you think our economy is in
[01:28.760 --> 01:33.720]  freefall now imagine what's gonna happen as these carbon taxes go into place so
[01:33.720 --> 01:39.440]  that is coming up I've got a ton of vital news and information throughout the
[01:39.440 --> 01:45.440]  broadcast today all of these stacks are incredibly important let's just look at
[01:45.440 --> 01:53.320]  this headline CNBC world panel backs rules to avert banking crisis world
[01:53.320 --> 01:58.360]  rules run by the very mega banks that have engineered the derivatives
[01:58.360 --> 02:04.840]  collapse and this is a global model of the US model of giving the Federal
[02:04.840 --> 02:11.880]  Reserve more power a few months ago and more secrecy in their activities dealing
[02:11.880 --> 02:16.200]  with the economy so they engineered the crisis get more power offer the solution
[02:16.200 --> 02:22.920]  give them even more power and autonomy and immunity so we'll be getting into
[02:22.920 --> 02:28.800]  this latest announcement of world government also doomsday warnings of
[02:28.800 --> 02:36.680]  US apocalypse gain ground that of course is a report out of AFP so mainstream news
[02:36.680 --> 02:40.680]  talking about the economic apocalypse but offering their banking takeover is
[02:40.680 --> 02:46.080]  the way to fix it when they engineered it US states step in to meet cities debt
[02:46.080 --> 02:50.200]  cost that's happening all over the United States the cities go bankrupt then
[02:50.200 --> 02:56.000]  the states go bankrupt will be discussing that also the Pentagon United
[02:56.000 --> 03:01.160]  States Joint Forces Command warns that huge US debt might lead to military
[03:01.160 --> 03:06.840]  impotence default or revolution but that's the game plan engineer the
[03:06.840 --> 03:12.440]  collapse then when their societal degeneration disintegration they come
[03:12.440 --> 03:17.920]  in with police state controls this is in the 2002 IMF World Bank documents that
[03:17.920 --> 03:24.560]  were leaked to the BBC they call it the IMF riot they want the people to riot
[03:24.560 --> 03:31.720]  that that's just the final trigger for the final phase so we'll be discussing
[03:31.720 --> 03:37.720]  that as well Rand Paul tells it like it is it's while we got a saluting since
[03:37.720 --> 03:45.240]  GOP shares blame for deficits there's all these people giddily getting excited
[03:45.240 --> 03:48.840]  over the fact that Republicans are gonna win the House for sure probably
[03:48.840 --> 03:51.920]  believe the Senate more and more it's trending towards that the next month that
[03:51.920 --> 03:59.520]  I have into the 2010 midterm elections but it's just like Obamanoids who were
[03:59.520 --> 04:03.080]  giddy whenever he was showing he was gonna win a month and a half out in the
[04:03.080 --> 04:07.720]  polls like all their problems are gonna be solved oh thank you mr. Obama all my
[04:07.720 --> 04:13.320]  problems are solved I get a free house a free car you got nothing except further
[04:13.320 --> 04:17.880]  destruction of your living standard and your freedoms and so all you giddy
[04:17.880 --> 04:22.080]  people and I've heard talk show host this morning listening to local Texas
[04:22.080 --> 04:27.560]  radio and national radio giddy they've invested their psychology they've
[04:27.560 --> 04:35.040]  invested their identities in the Republicans and if the current leadership
[04:35.040 --> 04:40.840]  of the Republican Party is able to maintain control we're gonna be here in
[04:40.840 --> 04:45.840]  a couple years same place as we were but that all the polls show that
[04:45.840 --> 04:49.400]  society people are waking up to this false left-right paradigms that's very
[04:49.400 --> 04:55.320]  exciting we'll be discussing that and a lot more coming up today I never got to

[08:49.760 --> 09:13.000]  you have no resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[09:13.000 --> 09:29.440]  we are live Monday September 13th 2010 resistance to tyrants is obedience to
[09:29.440 --> 09:38.000]  God the global engineers are using psychological warfare techniques to
[09:38.000 --> 09:45.280]  attempt to break our will to resist to sell us on the lie that we are already
[09:45.280 --> 09:51.960]  beaten and that resistance to dehumanization and enslavement is a
[09:51.960 --> 10:00.720]  foregone conclusion the very act of consciously setting your will against
[10:00.720 --> 10:09.400]  tyranny will bring down this parasitical world government system and we don't
[10:09.400 --> 10:16.200]  have a choice total dehumanization and forced population reduction is the end
[10:16.200 --> 10:25.320]  game goal of the controllers who hate humanity and our prototypical control
[10:25.320 --> 10:31.120]  freaks and greedy creatures that want the world and all that is in it for
[10:31.120 --> 10:36.800]  themselves we do have Don Adams joining us I had him on a few weeks ago for 30
[10:36.800 --> 10:40.440]  minutes I want a full hour with him to really break down his bombshell
[10:40.440 --> 10:45.040]  information on the JFK assassination he was an FBI agent who worked the case
[10:45.040 --> 10:49.240]  this is incredible info we covered it quickly a few weeks ago we're going to
[10:49.240 --> 10:53.680]  detail it in the next hour then we've got Mark Moreno joining us for part of
[10:53.680 --> 10:58.880]  the third hour with the fact that the former head author of the IPCC at the
[10:58.880 --> 11:04.720]  UN has come out and said that it is a complete fraud a complete lie and
[11:04.720 --> 11:09.080]  Pichari's had to admit they made it all up so they've gone from eight nine
[11:09.080 --> 11:14.120]  months ago when climate gate broke to denying it even existed to now being in
[11:14.120 --> 11:17.880]  complete freefall and I have the New York Times from last week saying okay
[11:17.880 --> 11:21.640]  we're now shifting out of we're doing this to save the earth from rising sea
[11:21.640 --> 11:26.520]  levels to just there's too many humans we've got to reduce population so now
[11:26.520 --> 11:33.240]  they're just being honest about what their real plan is and all over the US
[11:33.240 --> 11:36.840]  and British and European news they're saying look if you won't go along with
[11:36.840 --> 11:42.840]  this in a democracy we will force it dictatorially because we know best the
[11:42.840 --> 11:50.000]  tyrants are now out in the open saying that they are tyrants now I'm going to
[11:50.000 --> 11:55.000]  attempt right now to go over at least a third of the news in fact for prison
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.120]  planet TV viewers you can give me a bird's-eye document cam shot this is all
[11:59.120 --> 12:09.320]  fresh news just today just today and it's all off the charts insane

[12:13.560 --> 12:18.960]  everything at us at once they know we're awakening and they're trying to fully
[12:18.960 --> 12:23.960]  overwhelm us psychologically and spiritually and economically to
[12:23.960 --> 12:28.720]  dominate us I mean look at these headlines I've got these all over the
[12:28.720 --> 12:36.240]  country today without even looking it's pouring in it's the same model in
[12:36.240 --> 12:43.200]  Australia the same model in Germany the same model in England and Canada cities
[12:43.200 --> 12:47.720]  are moving to make you get a license and an inspection to be able to grow
[12:47.720 --> 12:51.680]  tomatoes in your backyard saying you might grow marijuana you might be a
[12:51.680 --> 12:59.960]  criminal the magnitude of this this is WSB TV County Sue's farmers sites too

[13:05.600 --> 13:11.080]  local farmers market organic and they find him $5,000 and are shutting him
[13:11.080 --> 13:14.560]  down and they admit well he's actually grandfathered to be able to have a
[13:14.560 --> 13:20.680]  garden but we don't care they are harassing Amish they are harassing
[13:20.680 --> 13:24.400]  truck farmers people that grow it and truck it into town they are harassing

[13:42.560 --> 13:48.160]  fig off of your tree and to take it inside and slice it up and put it in a
[13:48.160 --> 13:52.120]  pie we've got a fig tree in our backyard we try to go out there when

[14:03.840 --> 14:13.120]  my backyard giant fig tree if you slice a fruit it is preparation and
[14:13.120 --> 14:19.680]  manufacturing and you are going to go to federal prison you are a prisoner you

[14:29.160 --> 14:34.080]  gonna eat cross species fish you are going to be killed with the soft kill
[14:34.080 --> 14:38.240]  weapons period if they have their way they're panicking you know their farm
[14:38.240 --> 14:42.120]  farmers market sprouting up everywhere they're starting to displace the main
[14:42.120 --> 14:46.480]  line big agribusiness family farms are starting to make a micro comeback people
[14:46.480 --> 14:50.480]  are getting smart they're refusing to drink out of bisphenol a containers
[14:50.480 --> 14:54.160]  that's getting removed off store shelves all over the country and the world
[14:54.160 --> 14:58.080]  people are fighting and in many cases having sodium fluoride removed from
[14:58.080 --> 15:02.920]  their water the globalists are panicking they are panicking because they
[15:02.920 --> 15:09.240]  know you're waking up and they are coming in and they are saying you aren't
[15:09.240 --> 15:14.320]  gonna have a water well you aren't gonna have a garden in your backyard you
[15:14.320 --> 15:20.880]  aren't gonna can for yourself and if you do we're gonna throw you in prison now
[15:20.880 --> 15:26.520]  if that isn't the ultimate tyranny I don't know what is let's go back 80 years
[15:26.520 --> 15:32.360]  ago 80 plus years ago within a decade of linen Vladimir Lennon getting into
[15:32.360 --> 15:36.600]  power if you've studied the Soviet Union right through to the days of
[15:36.600 --> 15:40.720]  Alexander Schultz and eats on the 50s and 60s fighting at the labor camps the
[15:40.720 --> 15:46.560]  first thing they did was say you have to get a license now to have your farm
[15:46.560 --> 15:50.760]  then they would deny the license within 10 years they had trained the farmers
[15:50.760 --> 15:54.960]  that it was illegal to grow any food on their own it could only be done through
[15:54.960 --> 16:01.000]  collectives and millions of peasants not just in Russia but in Ukraine more
[16:01.000 --> 16:05.560]  than 10 million in Ukraine starved to death because they weren't allowed to
[16:05.560 --> 16:09.040]  grow food they had to go to government communal areas and grow it so the
[16:09.040 --> 16:15.080]  government controlled everything they were doing now by the 1940s so many
[16:15.080 --> 16:18.640]  millions of people had starved to death and the Germans were invading and they
[16:18.640 --> 16:25.160]  needed to get food produced so they said okay farmers are allowed one acre of
[16:25.160 --> 16:32.000]  land that they originally owned peasant farmers under government supervision
[16:32.000 --> 16:37.120]  and they've got to give half of it to the government to the NKVD controlled
[16:37.120 --> 16:43.680]  people but you're allowed now to grow your own food this is total complete
[16:43.680 --> 16:56.320]  Vladimir Joseph Stalin tyranny Vladimir Lenin Joe Stalin tyranny 100% and of
[16:56.320 --> 17:00.200]  course what did they do in the Soviet Union they said they were doing this for
[17:00.200 --> 17:05.160]  food safety and they'd run news articles about somebody who got in sick from some
[17:05.160 --> 17:11.080]  food they didn't do it for food safety just like they claim over our gas taxes
[17:11.080 --> 17:16.520]  are down not true gas receipts are actually up just search that term more
[17:16.520 --> 17:20.800]  cars more people on the road they lie about that but they say we need satellite
[17:20.800 --> 17:25.200]  tracker boxes in all your cars taxing you by the milder to go on top the gas
[17:25.200 --> 17:31.040]  tax they could easily just raise the gas tax if they really needed it but they
[17:31.040 --> 17:37.720]  want to track everything you do so they come out and roll it out in the name of
[17:37.720 --> 17:45.600]  raising money ladies and gentlemen look at these articles here's one out of
[17:45.600 --> 17:50.200]  Town Hall where the Obama administration is publicly sending out
[17:50.200 --> 17:57.320]  letters to insurance companies saying quote this is Town Hall Michael Barone
[17:57.320 --> 18:01.600]  gangster government stifles criticism of Obamacare that's Town Hall with an
[18:01.600 --> 18:08.400]  infowars.com type headline what did NBC say on Friday police state in Philly in
[18:08.400 --> 18:14.280]  fact we reprint that for me police state in Philly and it said the police are
[18:14.280 --> 18:18.680]  running checkpoints searching people at the bus terminals the trains the roads
[18:18.680 --> 18:23.240]  and there's the quote we can search and do whatever we want there is no fourth
[18:23.240 --> 18:28.320]  amendment the local police say they're now under homeland security to do whatever
[18:28.320 --> 18:35.560]  they want and the headline is police state Philly and the headline here
[18:35.560 --> 18:39.920]  gangster government stifles criticism of Obamacare they're sending letters out
[18:39.920 --> 18:46.440]  to insurance companies saying quote there will be zero tolerance for this
[18:46.440 --> 18:55.000]  type of misinformation and unjustified rate increases the insurance companies
[18:55.000 --> 19:01.360]  wrote this legislation the big ones it does raise the prices the premiums are
[19:01.360 --> 19:07.520]  going up on an average of 25% and so Obama's people come out and pose like
[19:07.520 --> 19:11.120]  they're getting tough on the insurance company saying they'll be zero tolerance
[19:11.120 --> 19:18.600]  remember that Bloomberg headline six months ago pension funds being invested
[19:18.600 --> 19:22.480]  in failed banks and then the article quoted federal regulators saying they
[19:22.480 --> 19:30.320]  were ordering private pension fund managers as well as public private
[19:30.320 --> 19:37.960]  pension fund managers police you name it unions teachers unions to invest in

[22:15.120 --> 22:19.240]  the pursuit of happiness unfortunately with the Drug and Money Laundering Act
[22:19.240 --> 22:23.960]  the IRS revenue ruling 6045 of 1984 and the Trading with the Enemy Act in
[22:23.960 --> 22:28.760]  Franklin D Roosevelt's executive order of 1933 some precious metal holdings are
[22:28.760 --> 22:32.240]  subject to government intervention for this reason Midas Resources has

[23:05.000 --> 23:09.320]  audacity toward nature a similar audacity called GMO or genetically modified
[23:09.320 --> 23:12.600]  organisms means that the quality of commercially grown food may be
[23:12.600 --> 23:16.080]  compromised with our health in the balance now that summer's here what

[24:08.600 --> 24:13.800]  alright continuing with the information documenting that we're being bathed in
[24:13.800 --> 24:18.400]  tyranny being conditioned to accept it gangster government stifles criticism
[24:18.400 --> 24:25.920]  of obama care and they're ordering the insurance companies to not
[24:25.920 --> 24:29.720]  criticize obama care because it's not one monolithic group it was the big top
[24:29.720 --> 24:33.080]  ones owned by banks that actually wrote the legislation with the smaller and
[24:33.080 --> 24:34.880]  medium-sized are against it
[24:34.880 --> 24:37.200]  and there's a look we have to raise prices
[24:37.200 --> 24:41.400]  and then the article goes on to admit that even Time magazine's
[24:41.400 --> 24:45.200]  uh... Karen Pickett points out that sabilius ignores the fact
[24:45.200 --> 24:48.800]  that individual insurance plans cover different types of populations
[24:48.800 --> 24:50.640]  so that government and some
[24:50.640 --> 24:54.320]  industry and academic experts think that the new law will justify
[24:54.320 --> 24:56.720]  increases
[24:56.720 --> 24:58.120]  but it doesn't matter
[24:58.120 --> 24:59.800]  the obama crowd
[24:59.800 --> 25:03.680]  is telling him there will be zero tolerance for this
[25:03.680 --> 25:05.240]  and here's that bloomberg
[25:05.240 --> 25:08.480]  uh... headline dealing with the quote
[25:08.480 --> 25:12.320]  uh... where the federal government with no law
[25:12.320 --> 25:14.600]  ordered
[25:14.600 --> 25:17.200]  ordered
[25:17.200 --> 25:22.360]  the private pension fund managers to quote invest in failed banks will put
[25:22.360 --> 25:24.040]  that up on screen
[25:24.040 --> 25:27.960]  failed banks may get pension fund backing as fdic six cash
[25:27.960 --> 25:30.120]  that's from march eighth of this year
[25:30.120 --> 25:33.320]  but then you read the article it admits they're already being ordered to
[25:33.320 --> 25:36.200]  invest two trillion in pension funds with them
[25:36.200 --> 25:37.880]  ordered under what law
[25:37.880 --> 25:41.440]  we've got to start saying no to these crux
[25:41.440 --> 25:45.480]  and here's another example random pat downs turn pat co into police state
[25:45.480 --> 25:50.160]  nbc news commuters clothing pockets bags and vehicles to be randomly searched
[25:50.160 --> 25:53.280]  and homeland security says they're going to expand it to shopping malls
[25:53.280 --> 25:56.720]  and the side of the road and they've got federal grants for police to take blood
[25:56.720 --> 25:57.800]  without warrants
[25:57.800 --> 25:59.720]  or dna all over the country
[25:59.720 --> 26:05.000]  they're just training us to accept all of this now let's look at england
[26:05.000 --> 26:05.760]  i
[26:05.760 --> 26:07.880]  barack dobama
[26:07.880 --> 26:10.800]  uh... this teenager in england
[26:10.800 --> 26:13.880]  sent a email
[26:13.880 --> 26:16.320]  barack obama a punk
[26:16.320 --> 26:18.720]  and for calling him a punk
[26:18.720 --> 26:21.280]  he has been banned for life
[26:21.280 --> 26:23.480]  and the fb is quoted as saying
[26:23.480 --> 26:24.440]  that they are
[26:24.440 --> 26:29.280]  furious and that this is unacceptable to talk bad about our president so the
[26:29.280 --> 26:32.520]  fb is now in the business
[26:32.520 --> 26:34.760]  but this is a global model in england
[26:34.760 --> 26:37.200]  if you've done mild things
[26:37.200 --> 26:39.200]  things that should be illegal
[26:39.200 --> 26:44.120]  or never made statements that they call hurtful or xenophobic not even racist
[26:44.120 --> 26:47.840]  you are arrested but then banned from leaving england
[26:47.840 --> 26:51.880]  remember hooligans who've ever gotten in a fight or cause a disruption at a
[26:51.880 --> 26:53.000]  soccer game
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.360]  and now they throw you out for nothing you're putting a database and you're
[26:56.360 --> 26:59.760]  not allowed to quote leave the country
[26:59.760 --> 27:03.720]  during the world cup or other international soccer events it's
[27:03.720 --> 27:08.160]  creating the precedent of databases to not be able to travel and then michael
[27:08.160 --> 27:11.000]  savage he can't go to england
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.400]  he got taken off the list because the protest and now the new
[27:15.400 --> 27:18.960]  prime minister the conservative who supports global carbon taxes like
[27:18.960 --> 27:22.280]  blend back does and like uh...
[27:22.280 --> 27:25.640]  newt gingrich does but that's okay you know they're so conservative their pro
[27:25.640 --> 27:26.920]  new world order
[27:26.920 --> 27:29.560]  that he said you are a punk
[27:29.560 --> 27:33.240]  and so he's banned from life
[27:33.240 --> 27:36.600]  to traveling to the u.s the message is
[27:36.600 --> 27:39.320]  you're not allowed to travel you're not allowed to leave they're making it harder
[27:39.320 --> 27:41.120]  and harder for americans to leave
[27:41.120 --> 27:43.280]  harder and harder for brits to leave
[27:43.280 --> 27:47.280]  but easier for third world people to come in who are then made your police
[27:47.280 --> 27:50.360]  your cps workers we've had members of parliament on from england talk about
[27:50.360 --> 27:50.920]  that
[27:50.920 --> 27:54.520]  how they're building armies of foreigners to rule us
[27:54.520 --> 27:57.720]  so there's the article here's another out of the star out of england
[27:57.720 --> 28:00.840]  ringtone race ral that means fight
[28:00.840 --> 28:04.560]  ringtone race fight lands fan

[28:13.560 --> 28:16.200]  so it's a movie

[28:30.840 --> 28:32.000]  be offended by that
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.880]  they're just taking normal words and then saying their races remember robin

[28:44.240 --> 28:47.120]  for saying the word homosexual
[28:47.120 --> 28:48.720]  he said rural communities
[28:48.720 --> 28:53.240]  deserve the same rights as muslims and homosexuals and they said that word is
[28:53.240 --> 28:54.400]  hurtful
[28:54.400 --> 28:55.600]  the scientific word
[28:55.600 --> 28:57.720]  heterosexual homosexual

[29:12.760 --> 29:14.520]  using racial terms
[29:14.520 --> 29:17.640]  people been arrested here and the media with the mosque

[30:04.440 --> 30:08.360]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[30:08.360 --> 30:08.800]  bill
[30:08.800 --> 30:13.080]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[30:13.080 --> 30:14.560]  company allows you to have

[30:18.680 --> 30:23.120]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[30:23.120 --> 30:26.880]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[30:26.880 --> 30:29.360]  is only compounding the problem number four
[30:29.360 --> 30:33.200]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[30:33.200 --> 30:35.800]  families lose their power from weather-related onages

[34:14.520 --> 34:17.480]  we are reaching more and more people
[34:17.480 --> 34:21.480]  because so much of what we talked about in decades past is now unfolded
[34:21.480 --> 34:23.200]  in triplicate
[34:23.200 --> 34:25.960]  but we need to accelerate
[34:25.960 --> 34:30.800]  this platform to reach more people and we need to expand our operation
[34:30.800 --> 34:34.040]  that's why we have a donate button at the bottom of info wars dot com if you

[34:43.040 --> 34:44.880]  and right now we're kind of stalled out
[34:44.880 --> 34:47.320]  on that because the economy so bad
[34:47.320 --> 34:51.120]  and our listenerships tripled but the capital stayed the same or gone down

[37:44.000 --> 37:48.160]  nobody's got a bigger bang for the buck in the media anywhere
[37:48.160 --> 37:52.120]  i mean if it's uh... for the amount of money i invest in the situation
[37:52.120 --> 37:56.360]  for what we put into things for what we do i mean it goes back to
[37:56.360 --> 37:58.400]  eleven years ago
[37:58.400 --> 38:02.400]  i had ten thousand dollars in the bank
[38:02.400 --> 38:05.000]  and i took all of it
[38:05.000 --> 38:06.680]  and bought a
[38:06.680 --> 38:10.840]  six thousand dollar computer and a four thousand dollar camera
[38:10.840 --> 38:13.400]  when i was living
[38:13.400 --> 38:18.720]  in a apartment with giant cockroaches running around in it
[38:18.720 --> 38:22.000]  and you know by then i was already on more than fifteen radio stations had a
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.960]  website but i didn't even really have money to hire somebody to package the
[38:24.960 --> 38:26.280]  books and videos
[38:26.280 --> 38:29.560]  i was doing the web mastering with my girlfriend now my wife
[38:29.560 --> 38:30.520]  that was just
[38:30.520 --> 38:32.320]  two of us
[38:32.320 --> 38:34.000]  and i
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.680]  did everything i could increase the quality of our productions to to do more
[38:38.680 --> 38:40.680]  and i've always had that same
[38:40.680 --> 38:42.960]  mindset and system
[38:42.960 --> 38:44.960]  to take the profits
[38:44.960 --> 38:47.960]  from the operation and put it back
[38:47.960 --> 38:50.440]  and that's why so many other people they'll turn to the media have not been
[38:50.440 --> 38:51.320]  successful
[38:51.320 --> 38:54.760]  they take profits
[38:54.760 --> 38:56.520]  spend them
[38:56.520 --> 39:00.400]  we take over ninety percent of the money that comes in here and put it right
[39:00.400 --> 39:03.400]  back in to this operation
[39:03.400 --> 39:07.680]  and i took a big gamble two years ago decided to move to this office
[39:07.680 --> 39:11.520]  a year ago i took a big gamble least the big space next door
[39:11.520 --> 39:15.360]  and it held up by the city for six months we just completed it in the last
[39:15.360 --> 39:18.320]  month now i've got a furnish it put the equipment in
[39:18.320 --> 39:19.360]  i've got to do it all
[39:19.360 --> 39:20.680]  and we cannot
[39:20.680 --> 39:21.560]  do it
[39:21.560 --> 39:23.760]  we're probably talking about
[39:23.760 --> 39:28.080]  to buy low-end studio equipment and cameras and computers and furniture and
[39:28.080 --> 39:31.440]  everything
[39:31.440 --> 39:33.000]  a three hundred
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.360]  to four hundred thousand dollar investment
[39:36.360 --> 39:40.560]  and to hire two or three people to to to
[39:40.560 --> 39:43.320]  to skeleton crew it
[39:43.320 --> 39:46.520]  we're talking about another hundred hundred fifty thousand dollars
[39:46.520 --> 39:49.080]  to hire qualified people
[39:49.080 --> 39:50.560]  we don't have
[39:50.560 --> 39:52.240]  that capital
[39:52.240 --> 39:55.000]  right now to do that
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.560]  unless i take our emergency reserves
[39:57.560 --> 40:01.200]  in case we get litigated against we got to be able to stand up for ourselves
[40:01.200 --> 40:04.400]  uh... in case uh... you know the feds
[40:04.400 --> 40:06.000]  set us up and rate us
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.400]  you all sorts of things i have an emergency backup where we can operate
[40:09.400 --> 40:12.600]  for six months of the economy totally shut down
[40:12.600 --> 40:16.200]  i i've got emergency backup for six months
[40:16.200 --> 40:19.400]  takes a lot of money to run this place
[40:19.400 --> 40:22.600]  well over a hundred thousand dollars a month
[40:22.600 --> 40:24.840]  i've got emergency backup money
[40:24.840 --> 40:30.120]  but i don't want to spend that emergency backup funds
[40:30.120 --> 40:33.200]  on the new operation and gamble
[40:33.200 --> 40:36.960]  so i'm just going to tell you we need your support info wars dot com
[40:36.960 --> 40:41.480]  and a lot of people said we didn't do a money bomb this year
[40:41.480 --> 40:44.320]  what your four or five months past your you know the anniversary of it that was
[40:44.320 --> 40:45.560]  listeners ideas
[40:45.560 --> 40:49.000]  fact two two-and-a-half years ago the first money bomb we've done to
[40:49.000 --> 40:50.480]  was started
[40:50.480 --> 40:52.200]  by other folks not even us and
[40:52.200 --> 40:55.320]  at first i didn't promote it i didn't really know what was going on and people
[40:55.320 --> 40:57.040]  said well hey it's picking up steam do it
[40:57.040 --> 40:58.480]  and it was that money
[40:58.480 --> 41:01.400]  that helped us two years ago make the decision to move into these bigger and
[41:01.400 --> 41:02.520]  better studios
[41:02.520 --> 41:05.600]  and look at what we've done look at the expansion
[41:05.600 --> 41:09.200]  look at the tripling of the radio audience the news websites the
[41:09.200 --> 41:12.560]  people were reaching hundreds of millions watching the films for free every
[41:12.560 --> 41:13.520]  year online
[41:13.520 --> 41:15.680]  i mean this is a massive
[41:15.680 --> 41:16.520]  what's happening
[41:16.520 --> 41:19.720]  but the next few days i will announce the october date
[41:19.720 --> 41:22.080]  of the two thousand and ten twenty ten
[41:22.080 --> 41:23.720]  money bomb
[41:23.720 --> 41:26.560]  and so we're building that site getting it all ready i've got to
[41:26.560 --> 41:30.000]  do an air and are going out of town to interview folks for the film i'm working
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.040]  on
[41:31.040 --> 41:34.400]  limited personnel so i can't shoot the tour yet but as soon as they get back i'm
[41:34.400 --> 41:37.560]  gonna shoot the tour of the entire facility the old facility
[41:37.560 --> 41:40.080]  the new facility and show you
[41:40.080 --> 41:44.720]  literally the ticket items we need to put into their to go to the next level so
[41:44.720 --> 41:49.040]  we are engaging the globalist i mean this operation is like a star destroyer
[41:49.040 --> 41:50.960]  in the fight against the new world order
[41:50.960 --> 41:52.840]  and uh... you know we've we've
[41:52.840 --> 41:55.560]  we've got a gutted star destroyer that we've built
[41:55.560 --> 41:58.640]  but we've got a man it we've got to put the equipment in
[41:58.640 --> 42:01.880]  and it'll be a skeleton crew three or four people at the helm of it
[42:01.880 --> 42:03.920]  but it it hopefully we
[42:03.920 --> 42:07.000]  and ladies and gentlemen i've been working for a year on launching a top
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.200]  rate
[42:08.200 --> 42:09.520]  social network
[42:09.520 --> 42:13.880]  they can take hundreds of thousands of members or even millions and not crash
[42:13.880 --> 42:15.560]  cost overrides on that
[42:15.560 --> 42:19.200]  fifty five thousand dollars with a local firm that
[42:19.200 --> 42:22.320]  has good references has done some great work in the past
[42:22.320 --> 42:25.200]  uh... we've got that going trying to launch it the next month it's supposed
[42:25.200 --> 42:26.440]  to launch this month
[42:26.440 --> 42:29.640]  uh... instead of just leasing new servers that would cost
[42:29.640 --> 42:33.640]  around seventy thousand dollars a year to run it properly we bought fifty five
[42:33.640 --> 42:34.760]  thousand dollars
[42:34.760 --> 42:37.880]  uh... same number is what they cost to to design it
[42:37.880 --> 42:40.040]  those servers are now in place
[42:40.040 --> 42:42.720]  uh... big gigantic suckers in fact
[42:42.720 --> 42:45.080]  mad i need you to go over to the uh...
[42:45.080 --> 42:46.800]  to the uh... technology
[42:46.800 --> 42:48.280]  uh... facility
[42:48.280 --> 42:50.080]  room we've got leased
[42:50.080 --> 42:53.040]  i need you to shoot video that is on a show folks in the tour
[42:53.040 --> 42:57.520]  on a show on those uh... what is it five giant servers
[42:57.520 --> 43:00.080]  giant servers that uh... what
[43:00.080 --> 43:03.160]  each one can hold sixteen hard drives
[43:03.160 --> 43:05.560]  did that right
[43:05.560 --> 43:09.840]  how many how many hard drives is each one of those giant servers hold
[43:09.840 --> 43:13.480]  i'm already digressing off into this and give you some background
[43:13.480 --> 43:15.200]  although thirty six excuse me
[43:15.200 --> 43:18.600]  oh you're only putting sixteen and then you have room to build out
[43:18.600 --> 43:19.440]  so we're putting
[43:19.440 --> 43:23.160]  sixteen hard drives per system
[43:23.160 --> 43:27.320]  and it was fifty five thousand correct
[43:27.320 --> 43:31.520]  and then and then to lease the room at the big uh... it center
[43:31.520 --> 43:35.080]  is what twelve hundred a month

[43:49.960 --> 43:52.200]  even the mid-grade we're doing it
[43:52.200 --> 43:54.440]  almost
[43:54.440 --> 43:58.400]  at the industrial cheap level i mean it is you don't understand
[43:58.400 --> 44:00.240]  what this stuff cost

[44:18.080 --> 44:20.560]  because i just want to cover the information but this is a different
[44:20.560 --> 44:21.800]  media animal
[44:21.800 --> 44:25.440]  we're not some big global neocon operation funded by fox news
[44:25.440 --> 44:26.560]  we're not some
[44:26.560 --> 44:30.160]  uh... you know liberal radio type network
[44:30.160 --> 44:32.400]  uh... that's funded by george soros
[44:32.400 --> 44:36.800]  uh... and we're not in p r funded by federal taxpayer money who also comes to
[44:36.800 --> 44:39.200]  you and begs for money
[44:39.200 --> 44:42.560]  you know they do it for a month or so every year on npr locally here and around
[44:42.560 --> 44:46.280]  other areas the country we have one day of money bomb a year and i wasn't going
[44:46.280 --> 44:47.440]  to do it
[44:47.440 --> 44:54.440]  but the economy is stalled on us and we need the capital for it i'm sad issue
[44:56.480 --> 44:57.720]  going back over
[44:57.720 --> 45:00.600]  uh... some of the issues that i was just covering
[45:00.600 --> 45:03.480]  county sues farmer sites too many crops
[45:03.480 --> 45:08.680]  for decades he's grown the crops w sb tv
[45:08.680 --> 45:13.320]  and now they're coming to him harassing him with five thousand dollar fines
[45:13.320 --> 45:16.800]  and they go on to admit that we'll we'll with the zoning you know he did have it
[45:16.800 --> 45:19.080]  but they're changing the zoning
[45:19.080 --> 45:20.880]  it's called cabbage gate
[45:20.880 --> 45:24.080]  fig trees broccoli cabbages are among the many
[45:24.080 --> 45:28.240]  greens that line the soil on steve miller's more than two acres of
[45:28.240 --> 45:30.000]  clarkston
[45:30.000 --> 45:33.560]  who said he spent fifteen years growing crops to give away and sell at local
[45:33.560 --> 45:34.640]  farmers markets
[45:34.640 --> 45:37.500]  it's a way of life it's something in my blood similar
[45:37.500 --> 45:41.440]  in january decobb county code enforcement officers began ticketing him
[45:41.440 --> 45:44.440]  for growing too many crops for the zoning and having unlimited employees on
[45:44.440 --> 45:45.240]  site
[45:45.240 --> 45:47.320]  miller stopped growing vegetables this summer
[45:47.320 --> 45:48.240]  and the charges
[45:48.240 --> 45:52.280]  were put on hold as he got the property rezoned
[45:52.280 --> 45:55.120]  i've got a separate article on this it was already previously zone properly
[45:55.120 --> 45:56.120]  they changed it
[45:56.120 --> 45:59.040]  two weeks after approval however his attorney said the county began
[45:59.040 --> 46:00.480]  prosecuting the old charges
[46:00.480 --> 46:03.120]  saying he was technically in violation before the rezoning
[46:03.120 --> 46:04.360]  it should go away
[46:04.360 --> 46:07.160]  i think it borders on harassment said miller's attorney
[46:07.160 --> 46:10.760]  he faces five thousand fines but he says he plans to fight those citations and
[46:10.760 --> 46:13.080]  reconsider his court later this month
[46:13.080 --> 46:15.720]  and folks i've got articles everywhere
[46:15.720 --> 46:20.240]  i mean i constantly where they're harassing farmers and people
[46:20.240 --> 46:24.800]  the amish you name it
[46:24.800 --> 46:27.880]  and it goes on to say neighbors have come to his defense
[46:27.880 --> 46:30.680]  when he moved here and i found out what he was doing i said steve
[46:30.680 --> 46:33.440]  you're the best thing that ever happened in
[46:33.440 --> 46:38.480]  simmer and drive and i still say that said neighbor
[46:38.480 --> 46:40.960]  face ox
[46:40.960 --> 46:42.480]  and again
[46:42.480 --> 46:46.240]  ring tone race ral lands fan
[46:46.240 --> 46:49.200]  in jail cell
[46:49.200 --> 46:53.960]  and his no kill went off in public
[46:53.960 --> 46:57.200]  and it's it was a quote from a famous movie in the movies a lot that they're
[46:57.200 --> 46:59.200]  like to make a movie where pakistani guy
[46:59.200 --> 47:00.960]  you know jokes and says
[47:00.960 --> 47:04.400]  i can't help being a packie which is means a pakistani but can they turn
[47:04.400 --> 47:07.240]  an abbreviation
[47:07.240 --> 47:08.360]  is saying
[47:08.360 --> 47:10.480]  tex for texas is that
[47:10.480 --> 47:13.440]  anti-texan
[47:13.440 --> 47:17.120]  but a woman from a mixed-race family was an amusement martins no kill went off
[47:17.120 --> 47:18.920]  and she
[47:18.920 --> 47:21.920]  squealed alongside him at a village shop
[47:21.920 --> 47:24.560]  overhearing the clip from the movie which chronicles the exploits of two
[47:24.560 --> 47:26.880]  schoolgirls growing up in a rundown east
[47:26.880 --> 47:31.160]  bradford the woman went home and logged on a formal complaint with the police
[47:31.160 --> 47:32.960]  they came in arresting
[47:32.960 --> 47:37.400]  and locked him in the jail cell
[47:37.400 --> 47:41.840]  england is a mega tearing and they're trying to set it up here
[47:41.840 --> 47:44.800]  and here is the obama ministration telling insurance companies
[47:44.800 --> 47:46.760]  you will not tell people
[47:46.760 --> 47:50.360]  that we're raising the prices of their coverage even though it's true
[47:50.360 --> 47:54.800]  there will be zero tolerance and remember what obama's people in vermont in
[47:54.800 --> 47:58.200]  missouri this is in the obama deception
[47:58.200 --> 47:59.800]  remember the tv ads
[47:59.800 --> 48:02.920]  and the newscast with police in uniform
[48:02.920 --> 48:07.600]  and with the local prosecutors saying if you say obama in the christian you
[48:07.600 --> 48:10.320]  will be arrested
[48:10.320 --> 48:15.240]  if you say obama wasn't born here you will be arrested

[54:19.480 --> 54:22.880]  media the dominant corporate media that's not so dominant so they're
[54:22.880 --> 54:28.360]  moving to try to censor the web this is out of Reuters Iraq combat over but US
[54:28.360 --> 54:32.200]  troops still in danger and then it quotes them as saying they're irritated
[54:32.200 --> 54:38.320]  they're angry that they've been renamed from combat brigades to combat
[54:38.320 --> 54:44.440]  assistance brigades and that they're still dying in fact in the last months
[54:44.440 --> 54:48.640]  as they made this announcement the numbers of deaths have increased so they
[54:48.640 --> 54:54.440]  went from 150,000 mercenaries to 200,000 that's admitted in the last month so
[54:54.440 --> 54:59.280]  they pulled roughly 40,000 US troops out sent about half of those to Afghanistan
[54:59.280 --> 55:04.440]  the other half back home we're already set to be rotated back and they sent
[55:04.440 --> 55:10.560]  more mercenaries in and you got 50,000 US troops there scores of bases some of
[55:10.560 --> 55:16.840]  them that are some of the largest US quote embassies in the world giant
[55:16.840 --> 55:22.840]  green zones and they run snatch and grab teams they run CIA payoff teams that buy
[55:22.840 --> 55:27.760]  off the media they have set up a nice little tyranny there and there's 50,000
[55:27.760 --> 55:32.320]  troops that roll around or called out to assist the Iraqi police and Iraqi
[55:32.320 --> 55:36.720]  military and they're still being killed and it was a lie seven and a half years
[55:36.720 --> 55:41.320]  ago when George Bush got on the deck of the aircraft carrier off the coast of
[55:41.320 --> 55:46.240]  California implied that he was off the coast of Iraq and got out in his
[55:46.240 --> 55:50.080]  fighter pilot outfit and Fox News I was watching it live said he really was a
[55:50.080 --> 55:54.520]  fighter race he looks good in that uniform he's tough kind of like
[55:54.520 --> 55:58.040]  Vladimir Putin constantly out there doing all these different tough guy
[55:58.040 --> 56:06.360]  things you know spring the wildfires you know out there shooting animals it's
[56:06.360 --> 56:11.080]  like oh he's Arnold Schwarzenegger and it's the same image with Bush well now
[56:11.080 --> 56:15.200]  with Obama he's just played musical chairs a shell game with the troops and
[56:15.200 --> 56:21.360]  just tells everybody that the war is over it's all over for the unknown
[56:21.360 --> 56:26.640]  soldier by the way we're gonna get dick Gregory on in the next few days civil
[56:26.640 --> 56:31.720]  rights icon I called him this morning never talked to dick Gregory one of
[56:31.720 --> 56:36.640]  the greatest living civil rights people and he called me dr. Jones and he said
[56:36.640 --> 56:40.840]  I'm a big supporter and admire what you do I was blown away by that and he's
[56:40.840 --> 56:44.120]  we're working with a scheduler to get him on the next week maybe the next few
[56:44.120 --> 56:49.760]  days but dick Gregory announces hunger strike for 9-11 truth says he will not

[59:49.280 --> 01:00:00.560]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:12.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:19.960]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:29.840]  alex jones five months ago we reported on stage stings at the austin gun show
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.560]  outside of law the police just ordered the gun show shut down they threaten
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:39.760]  racketeering charges crack house law maneuvers if they didn't follow the
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:43.480]  order and so they shut it down and then we had a press release a week and a half
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:50.920]  ago with paul velty austin lawyer here in town with the headline Texas veteran
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:56.280]  gets prison for selling illegal immigrant with a driver's license a gun
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:01:01.120]  illegal released well fox is now picked up on the story just showing how
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:06.280]  literally everything we cover ends up being in the news two weeks ago we broke
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:10.120]  because it was leaked to us by law enforcement the FBI internal memorandum
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:15.640]  that they were predicting violence if the caran was burned there in florida and
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:22.680]  abc news did source us and did cite our article in the document this one it
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:27.280]  didn't do that but that's fine the point is that's why this radio show so
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:32.520]  important we're able to force stories every day stuff that we reported on a
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:38.280]  year ago six months ago a month ago two weeks ago a week ago we then see it in
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:44.360]  mainstream news very very exciting and I'm not bragging about this this is why
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.680]  I have such a huge responsibility it's why I work so hard it's why I come in
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:51.240]  every Sunday to do a two-hour abbreviated broadcast because we're
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:58.200]  really affecting change and you can too and so now this Obama justice
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:02.840]  department program that's going on nationwide of using illegal aliens to
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:07.800]  go in for stings and letting the illegal aliens go who were able to get
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:11.720]  driver's license this illustrates everything we're facing I'm gonna
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:16.360]  continue with the economy coming up later but I wanted to dovetail this issue
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:21.240]  with gun dealer gets prison for selling to illegal immigrant illegal middleman
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:25.640]  not charged and of course they had later they did have a driver's license
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:29.640]  where's the investigation of how we got a driver's license well I'll tell you when
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:34.840]  they put thumb scanners in in 1994 and Bill Clinton signed the executive order
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:39.400]  but they went in in Texas we already had a real ID then national ID card they
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.280]  just now got around to telling people the last two years so they always do it
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:48.600]  they put it in place then announce it that in the news they had Lamar Smith
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:53.520]  and others in the news saying oh we're doing this local congressman to stop
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:58.320]  illegal aliens the illegal aliens can walk in with a fake consul matricula
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:02.640]  fake name anything they're given the license
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:09.120]  but citizens are held to a higher standard and here it is USA today
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:13.760]  yesterday US shifts approach to deporting illegal immigrants
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.400]  the Obama administration is changing the federal immigration enforcement
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.840]  strategy in ways that reduce the threat of deportation for millions of illegal
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:24.080]  immigrants even in states such as Arizona Colorado Virginia Ohio Texas are
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:28.560]  pushing to accelerate deportations and it goes on to report what we got into
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:32.320]  over a year ago that deportations are way down and when they did have
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:37.840]  deportations this was in the news they arrest them in these staged PR stunts
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:41.680]  that meet packing plants under places and they take them to homeland security
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:46.320]  ice offices and give them green cards on the spot
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:50.480]  including aggravated felons and now they're just pulling the border patrol
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:53.120]  many miles off the border in arizona and other states
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.640]  that's cns news and others reporting that they're telling them
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:01.440]  don't arrest illegals and don't deport them and when sheriffs and others
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:04.960]  are about to release people from jails and prisons
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:09.120]  they're refusing to come pick them up this has been going on for a long time
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:13.840]  but now it's out in the open so when you see an article in USA today again
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:18.720]  today homeland security to test iris scanners and i'll cover this in the
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:24.240]  third hour they're saying it's for illegals at the border
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:27.520]  oh yeah it was for people in feluja and illegals and then
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.440]  citizens and police departments under federal grants all over the country
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:35.200]  from texas to colorada are getting thumb scanners and retina scanners
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.640]  when they pull you over they come over and shoot a laser in your eye

[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:21.920]  all right in a minute we're going to don adams retired fpia agent we did an
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:25.360]  interview a few weeks ago with him it was only 30 minutes long i wanted to do
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:29.680]  most of an hour with him and i wanted specific questions
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:35.600]  from listeners about the information he has concerning the cover-up of who
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:39.120]  really killed jfk but after you've had a chance to
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.920]  hear him recap the information and go into more detail
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:45.040]  then i'll give the number out to take four or five phone calls for don adams
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:49.920]  specifically then mark merano is going to be joining us from climate depot to
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:53.680]  detail the continued implosion of the global carbon
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:57.600]  tax globe man-made global warming anthropogenic global warming fraud
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:01.600]  this is so important because the neo feudalistic
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:06.400]  domination all over the country banning garage sales saying you got to get a
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:10.880]  license harassing farmers amish people that have had
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:14.240]  gardens in their backyard for 15 years being fined
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:19.280]  it's all about ending barter economy ending
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:24.480]  private sales tracking everything you buy sell and trade and do
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:29.520]  this is total feudalism total and complete control
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:32.800]  and that's what i was getting into uh in the last
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:35.840]  uh segment dealing with the retina scanners the thumb printers
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:41.600]  just going in at tanning salons gyms restaurants hotels car rentals and
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:45.840]  they're trying to force you to do it and going back more than 12 years
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:49.200]  ago i noticed that there's these ink pads at all the major banks
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:52.320]  if you're cashing a check and you don't have a bank account with that bank
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:54.800]  now they try to make you do it even if you have a bank account with that bank
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:57.840]  and you go in you're trying to cash the money and get it out
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:01.200]  and i noticed that i would pull up those those ink pads that were usually
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:07.040]  stickered to the to the counter and it would always be a biometric consortium
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:11.120]  company and the top of the ink pad the cover of
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:15.840]  it would show a red sticker that looked like the
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:19.440]  actual glowing scanner with an image of a thumb print
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:24.080]  and i knew before i pulled it up the first time more than a decade ago
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:27.200]  that it would say a biometric company had given it to the bank for free
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:31.120]  that's long-term strategic planning pavlovian conditioning
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:34.720]  and i pulled it up biometric consortium went home
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:39.600]  search engine did on yahoo google wasn't even around then
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.960]  and boom it was a consortium to teach retailers
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:46.560]  about biometrics and how great they are then at home depot
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:50.880]  h e b grocery stores malls
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:56.160]  you'd have 10 check out counters first half of them would be self check out
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:59.920]  with a biometric scan then it'd be eight of the 10
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:05.280]  and at some stores all of the 10 and you're not even allowed
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:12.480]  to have someone serve you and now they're going in europe
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:16.560]  and trying to phase it in here to your own smart cart that scans everything as
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:19.680]  you do it this is for total control and they've got
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.280]  vending machines coming out where whole grocery stores are vending machines
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:26.560]  and to get each prohibited item spray paint beer
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:30.800]  razor blades cold medicine you got a swipe your license and thumb print
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:34.960]  or retina scan have a light shot in your eye
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:38.800]  this is the total control grid and i warned you about it in my first film
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:44.080]  made 13 years ago in 1997 america destroyed by design
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:48.720]  and now it is here and we've got to say no to this
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:52.960]  and the naked body scanners and all of it and they're starting to cave in from
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.600]  pressure first they lied and said they weren't
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.160]  saving the naked body scans and they said there wasn't any radiation it wasn't
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:01.760]  dangerous now they admit that now they say they're gonna have the computer
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:06.000]  put a cartoon template on the viewer screen for the tsa
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.120]  to cover up your genitals but still tell them if there's a gun
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:13.680]  that's another lie if you read the documentation on it with tsa saying
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:18.400]  they're gonna roll out there's still the naked image being saved and available
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:21.360]  because what they really want is the biometric scan of your body
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:25.200]  for passive cameras that send out waves that go through your clothes
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:28.640]  just like a retina scan a face scan a thumb print scan a voice print
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:34.320]  analysis biometrics that scan your walk this system
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:41.200]  this system will be able to scan the shape of your chest the shape of your
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:45.280]  arms your legs everything everything has an individual
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:50.320]  fingerprint basically and the globalist admit this is for a
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:54.160]  casual society total control to track you and and then to shut the economy
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.040]  down so you're bankrupt and under their control
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.720]  so that's all coming up and bill gates admits the death panels are real but
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:02.880]  says they're good we've got video of that
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:06.720]  i mean it's just it's unspeakable how evil all of this is
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:09.600]  and i said i get to this yesterday i didn't china
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:12.880]  rethinks his controversial one-child policy will tell you why
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:16.400]  we've broken down these numbers before but here it is in scores of mainstream
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:19.520]  newspapers with the chinese government admitting it themselves now
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:22.960]  shifting gears for the balance of the hour
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:27.040]  don adams donald a adams became a special agent of the fbi
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:31.200]  september 10 62 his assignment of note include investigations of
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:35.280]  joseph adams miltear and later in 64 the assassination to president john f
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.520]  kennedy he was recently come forward with
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:40.640]  explosive information regarding the events surrounding jfk's assassination
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:45.040]  and explosive is right here's a local tv station that an interview with him
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:50.720]  with the key clip with the key clip you can watch the whole thing
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:54.320]  up on info wars dot com and present plan dot com we have links to the tv station
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:14:01.840]  where they play the fbi and others intelligence audio of this individual
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:04.560]  talking about how he was going to kill kennedy where they were going to kill
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.800]  kennedy and then after they killed kennedy
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:11.040]  bragging to the intelligence officer how they did it
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:16.400]  here is that recording startling discovery was a tape recording
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:23.280]  captured by miami intelligence officers november 9th 1963 just weeks before
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:26.640]  dallas miltear is talking to the informant
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:39.520]  william summerset
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:44.640]  the fbi headquarters and secret service both had that tape within days
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:47.520]  but should have stopped the president from traveling instantly
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:52.400]  but they didn't and he says he was jubilant bragging to summerset you
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.200]  thought i was kidding when i said he would be killed from a window with a
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:00.160]  high-powered rifle despite all of that miltear was never even
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:04.000]  mentioned in the corn commission report now that's just one part of this and i
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.840]  was with jesse ventura who's doing a jfk episode and his conspiracy
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:11.760]  theorists with him last week in atlanta georgia and then in louisiana
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:15.760]  i don't know if they have time but i told them about mr adam's and they'd
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:19.040]  already been investigating miltear and had those tapes
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:22.640]  but this is an agent who knew about it tried to stop it was blocked
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:26.400]  and i think if they've got time they might go try to talk to him
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:30.240]  just amazing information it's adam's jfk.com's the website
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:33.360]  sir i'm going to give you the floor as we go to break in about five six minutes
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:38.800]  but recap the basics of the case and then let's get into more detail of why
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.680]  this is so important and why you're going public good to have you here
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:44.480]  don thanks alex i appreciate that very much
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:48.640]  you bet you you've got the floor to i mean recap the basic skeleton of this
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:52.640]  okay and and and and then we'll go into why this is so important and we have a
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:56.720]  bona fide cover up clearly showing government involvement go ahead
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:02.960]  okay uh my investigation started on november 13 1963
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:06.800]  uh two weeks before the president was assassinated
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:10.400]  i received a call from the agent in charge uh in the dallas
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:15.600]  i mean in the alana fbi office and uh he told me that he had a urgent matter
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:18.720]  that i needed to investigate and that it has to be highly
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:21.920]  confidential he told me that there had been a
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:25.200]  meeting that took place in indianapolis indiana
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:29.920]  uh just a week or two before the last of october of 63
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:34.640]  and in that meeting there were four people who had come out of a very large
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.920]  meeting and the four of them discussed the killing of
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:41.200]  president kennedy joseph miltear was one of them
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:45.200]  uh his real good school boyhood friend
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:49.200]  William Somerset was the second person and there were two other people
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:53.840]  that were involved in the discussion miltear
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:59.840]  tells uh tell somerset that they have a plan in works already
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:03.360]  where the president they have already studied this and the president had been
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:06.960]  leaving homestead air force base in florida
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:10.560]  he flies down uh in air force one and then
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:16.480]  gets into limousine uh does not have the bubble top on it it's open convertible
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:21.600]  and he travels up collins avenue now in 1963 there was no palm i mean there was
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:25.200]  no buildings or anything in that area it was just nothing but palm trees
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:29.760]  so he travels up collins avenue goes north to palm beach and then goes to the
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:33.920]  kennedy compound which they lived at for a number years prior
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:37.600]  to and he visits and then returns back to
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:41.600]  washington uh at the end of the weekend
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:46.000]  they said that what they planned to do was one of the four in that group
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.760]  it was a former sniper in the second world war
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:53.920]  and uh and he was willing to give his life
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:57.600]  to get up into the palm tree and these were tall palm trees
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:02.080]  to get up in a palm tree secrete himself up there and then as the motorcade
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:05.600]  passed by he would shoot the president in the back of the car
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:09.120]  knowing that he was going to be probably killed or wounded
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:12.240]  and he was willing to do that because he believed that much in
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:18.000]  in the cause uh if that failed then the second portion of it was
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.080]  they had a uh an apartment or a office building
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:27.040]  in washington dc across just behind lafayette park and across from the
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.720]  white house and they had purchased a heavy
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:36.400]  duty tripod and a heavy um uh weapon and they were going to shoot the president
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:41.120]  when he came out onto the portico excuse me or walk the grounds
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:47.040]  of the white house as a result of that uh this was their plan and this is what
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:51.200]  they were going to do the agent in charge told me
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:55.040]  that he wanted me to do a full background investigation
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:58.160]  on miltear as quickly as i possibly could
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:04.160]  miltear lived in quitman georgia he was uh very very close to a girl by the name
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:09.040]  of cc cofield who lived in valdosta georgia who was a prostitute
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:14.880]  and miltear spent more time with her than he did in in his valdosta home
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:18.160]  i mean his quit home is more in valdosta with her
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:22.160]  so anyway as a result of it uh in talking to the boss
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:26.160]  uh he told me to hold it very confidential and i told him i said well
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:29.600]  i'm going to need help on this and said i don't know that town too well

[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:12.800]  and I know you're like hey 80 plus or even higher percentage of Americans
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:16.880]  know that the government was involved killing Kennedy
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:20.240]  so why are we talking about it because if they can get away with that lie they
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:23.520]  can get away with anything and it's just like Bruce Willis told
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:26.480]  Vanity Fair after he saw some of my documentaries
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:30.000]  he said look the people that killed Kennedy are still running this country
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.120]  it's like Ron Paul has said we've had a coup in this nation
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:36.720]  I've got mainstream news articles about British troops running heroin
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:40.320]  of course they run the heroin I've got Fox News admitting our troops grow the
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:43.840]  opium in Afghanistan this is a lawless criminal
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:46.880]  government at the top and it's compartmentalized where most people
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:50.880]  don't know now Don Adams you had left off with
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:54.880]  you were trying to get the aid of a police chief but you were told no by the
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.120]  FBI this guy's telling people at meetings with FBI
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:02.240]  informants they're recording him that we're gonna kill him with a high-powered
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:09.280]  rifle please continue okay I finally got approval from him
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:13.440]  I persisted and I got approval and told him that we got accomplished a lot in a
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:16.960]  short period of time Bill Elliott and I went out and
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:21.360]  we did an enormous amount of work and for five days we
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:24.720]  we went to the credit bureau police department sheriff's offices
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:28.640]  to the schools to different organizations employment bureaus I mean
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:32.880]  you name it we went to it anything that he would have a possible connection with
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:36.480]  to get as much data as we possibly could
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:40.160]  Chief Elliott tells me that on Saturday mornings
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:44.160]  military goes out and stands on the on the corner and the streets at that
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:47.200]  time were just dirt streets in equipment
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:50.640]  stands on the corner in equipment Georgia every Saturday
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:55.040]  and he passes out hate literature that he mammographs and copies
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:58.560]  and there are not direct threats but implied threats
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:02.000]  as to his feelings towards the president Detroit John so on
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.520]  so on a Saturday I went and I wore old clothes and that and I went up to him
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:11.760]  and obtained from him a large amount of material and he was just
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:15.840]  very anxious to give it to me and try to get as much out to me as he could
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:19.440]  I took that material plus all the other information that I had
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:23.440]  obtained from him and I took it back to my house
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.880]  and then to the office and I worked late through the night
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:30.480]  and I compiled a complete report on this
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:34.320]  I subsequently then took the report to Atlanta and gave it to the special
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:37.920]  agent in charge because this request for us to do this investigation
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:42.080]  came from a secret service to us because they didn't have an agent in
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:45.760]  Thomasville so as a result of it I gave it to SAC
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:49.120]  he then in turn gave it to the special agent in charge of the
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:53.280]  secret service and and I was I was finished with it
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:59.760]  and that was a couple days before the 22nd and on the 22nd at 12 30
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:03.360]  my partner and I were in a car and we pulled up alongside a bus and the bus
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:06.400]  driver said did you hear what happened in Dallas and my
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:09.680]  partner who was on the right side said no he had not
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:13.920]  and he said they just shot the president in Dallas
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:17.360]  and my heart dropped right down through the floorboard I mean I just I was
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:20.480]  devastated because here I had just finished this workup
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:23.600]  and the first thoughts that went to my mind was did I mess up
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:27.440]  did I do something wrong you know what what happened here
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:31.360]  so anyway we got a call to go to the highway patrol barracks they had a
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:35.200]  message for us to go to the Department of Agriculture
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:38.880]  because they had teletype capabilities in the FBI did not
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:42.080]  we went there went through the formalities and introduced ourselves and so on
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:44.720]  and then we ended up going to the Department of Agriculture
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:48.320]  when I walked into the Department of Agriculture and we went to the teletype
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:51.040]  room I looked at the teletype and the teletype said
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:56.960]  Mr. Adamus the president of the United States is dead
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:01.760]  and you can't imagine how this how this hit me and then it said
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:05.440]  I'll call your agent in charge in Atlanta immediately
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:09.680]  so I call the agent in charge in Atlanta immediately and I can't tell you
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:14.480]  the emotions that went through my my system and that when this happened and
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:18.080]  the thoughts that went through my mind and that I call the agent in charge in
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:21.840]  Atlanta talk with him and he told me to locate
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.600]  military immediately and hold him for the sacred service
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:29.760]  so then I went out I left immediately and told my partner Royal McGraw
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:33.520]  I said I'm he's now deceased I said I'm leaving and I'm going to
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:37.520]  to hunt for for military and see if I can get him for the sacred service
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:41.680]  and so I took off and I went over there and I spent the 22nd
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:47.360]  Friday was that evening the 22nd all day Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday and
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:51.200]  Wednesday and Wednesday evening on the 27th I finally
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:55.760]  located him I had to get back up from the backup
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:01.600]  help from the agent over and Valdosta and he and I located him up 59 miles or
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:05.040]  60 miles north of Thomasville where he had left
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:09.920]  Colfield's house and I stopped him on the highway we
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:13.760]  took him back to Valdosta and I interviewed him
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:17.120]  now the strange thing that bothered me is the first indication I had one other
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:20.160]  indication but I'll tell you about that a little bit if I can
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:24.080]  but the first indication I had that there was something wrong with this was
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:28.320]  that my boss said to me there are only five questions that I want you to ask
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:31.840]  him and and nothing more and I said wait my
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:35.600]  boss has said he travels talks to people I can find out so much
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:38.320]  information he said you will ask these five questions
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:42.800]  this is an order and he will follow that Don stay there long segment coming up

[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:06.240]  getting up to the point now of they say can only ask him five questions
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:09.520]  right then you get transferred to Dallas you learn even more and get told to
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:12.080]  shut up yeah and now they release these tapes and
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:16.080]  all this stuff and it turns out the FBI knew all along but before you finish
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:18.800]  your your bombshell story that's totally documented
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:24.240]  this is so amazing what about the issue of you got a guy
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:27.760]  hanging out with a bunch of serious former military people
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:32.240]  saying we're going to kill the president I mean if somebody makes a joke and puts
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:35.200]  Obama on a target at a shooting range
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:38.240]  the secret service comes out and interviews them and a few people shot
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:41.760]  their mouth off and they've been arrested I know a guy sent me an email once
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:46.160]  saying you know I'm gonna kill Bush and I
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:49.440]  thought it was a setup trying to set me up so I
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:53.280]  called the secret service and two days later I got sent a Tennessee
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:56.400]  newspaper they went to his house he admitted
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:00.320]  that yeah I plan to do this turn out he was a lunatic and they arrested him
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:04.400]  okay so so sure you want to find out who else is involved
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:08.160]  but don't you immediately grab this guy if he's recorded by the FBI and
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:10.320]  informants saying we're gonna kill him with a high
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:14.080]  power I mean weren't you asking that question or did they tell you oh well
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:18.080]  we're not sure if he's serious well I mean regardless if somebody starts saying
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:21.440]  I'm gonna you know kill him with a high-powered rifle don't you get arrested
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:24.320]  for that well the problem with that is is that in
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:27.520]  those days the jurisdiction was with the secret service
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:31.440]  and so since they're asking us for our help to do the background information
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:36.240]  I can only do what we're told to do and as far as going out and taking it on my
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:39.520]  own to to change things or alter things and
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:42.960]  and try to affect an arrest or something like that you can't do that
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:46.240]  because the law says specifically what our jurisdiction
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:50.720]  as the FBI is and what secret services so once they asked us for the background
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:54.000]  that's all I and of course we know about the secret service stand down
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.600]  and we know they're planning to kill him in Florida then Chicago a secret
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:00.960]  service agent there went public and stopped it there that's on record
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:04.480]  uh and then they got him in Dallas and then he gets off the train and brags the
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:06.640]  informant I told you we were going to get him
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:10.560]  you think I was joking around here boy yeah well see that's
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:14.720]  that's the whole sad part about it is is that there were a number of little
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:18.080]  barometers that were telling us telling me that there
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:21.600]  was something wrong here and all I did was start
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:25.280]  uh totaling them up and adding them up and had to make sure that
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:29.840]  I was right on the right track and add but not until 1993
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:33.520]  did I get the book uh high treason and in that book it's
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:37.120]  uh the tape recording is actually uh copied in there
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:39.760]  and it tells in there that they're going to kill him from a tall building with a
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:43.920]  high-powered rifle and this was said on November the 9th of 63
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:48.720]  how he should have never gone to Dallas everybody failed but the thing is that
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:53.840]  uh where things are bad Alex is that all of this stuff disappeared
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:57.360]  all of the information that I did on my investigation concerning
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:01.600]  uh military there's nothing in washington in the in the file
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:06.640]  I found one document one piece of paper of the interview of
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:10.560]  military and and that's not even uh complete I mean there was a
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:13.760]  number of things other I got descriptive data from him and all the
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:18.640]  other stuff that I got none of that only thing I had was the first front page
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:22.800]  and even the front front page was altered because the very first question on
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:26.640]  there that's listed there I didn't ask him that question I never I don't know
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:30.320]  so they're putting the fake reports in and expunging the rest but but but also
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:34.480]  in that treason book you saw clearer than day bigger than Dallas
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:37.920]  military there looking right at Kennedy in the motorcade
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:40.800]  and boy he's got that Hawkeye looking at his quarry
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:44.400]  right and see everyone was trying to discredit that photograph but
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:48.160]  I know the guy I stood there and I talked to him I interviewed him
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:53.200]  and I took material from him as I said and you're not going to convince me
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:57.200]  and tell me that he's four inches shorter than the actual individual because
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:00.880]  that's military and when he's standing there looking
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:06.320]  at the subject I mean at the target uh two seconds or three seconds before he's
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:09.840]  finally and before he's shot I mean that I mean
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:13.840]  where are we where are we going with our investigations how are we going to
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:17.840]  conduct a proper investigation when we permit all this stuff to go on
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:21.760]  and then they sit in a and they and they destroy documents that are supposed to
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:25.120]  be in in the archives and things and and we can't do our
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:29.520]  investigations that way and we never I was totally
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:35.200]  uh dismayed as to the to the lack of of what they did in this
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:39.120]  investigation I mean I think my grandson I said this before my grandson
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:44.800]  uh who lives in in uh in in uh Florida uh he's 26 years old and he could have
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:48.320]  done a better investigation than than these people did
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:53.680]  and and they did nothing concerning the uh once they targeted Oswald
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:57.200]  said Oswald was a shooter that was the end of it and then they got rid of that
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:03.360]  patsy as well uh bottom line why are you going public
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:08.320]  a and b what is this what does this do to your world view of who runs this
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:10.960]  country and other things were told we now know the
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:14.880]  Gulf of Tonkin was staged to get us into Vietnam we now know they use
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:20.080]  muslim extremists to overthrow the leader of Iran it was pro-us
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:24.480]  we now know that there is a very wicked cold-blooded criminal group
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:27.520]  that does whatever they want and gets away with it and they're so arrogant
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:32.800]  now they come out on fox news and say yeah the marines grow the opium in
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:36.960]  afghanistan i mean it's just it's so in our face
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:40.880]  they lie about wmds they get away with murder i mean what
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:44.800]  what is true if they've been caught lying about this
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:49.440]  that's a that's an excellent question and then and it's in a point directly to
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:53.280]  what their concern is i mean when you take and you multiply
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:56.800]  what you just said and take a look at everything that's going on in this
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:00.880]  country it's scary and you wonder you know i mean uh you know people
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:03.440]  talk in terms of conspiracies and this and that
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:06.960]  uh and they make big issues about them and that but they are happening well
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:11.920]  you know it's called ht we're going into hyper tyranny
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:16.480]  and they're historically but currently with the evidence i mean there's no
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:20.720]  doubt we're not running this country presidents
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:24.560]  or puppets and you know plus the message that they
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:28.080]  could kill a president in broad daylight uh shooting
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:32.240]  in the throat as witnesses said they saw plumes of smoke and men with guns
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:35.440]  then they killed those witnesses they could have
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:38.640]  the brain and then people point out it's a fake brain
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:42.640]  not his brain so then the brain disappears out of the national archives
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:47.040]  right you've got them flying the limousine off to be rebuilt immediately
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:53.360]  it goes on and on and on and then i've even interviewed the late
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:58.480]  mistress of lbj and he was at the dress school a few days before in austin he
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:02.880]  says i'm going to kill that s o b and then i've talked to people that when he
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:06.160]  came out of the meeting in mergerson's house in dallas and they said we're
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:09.280]  going to kill that son of a bitch excuse me but that's what they said
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:12.480]  and you got nixon and all them there and they did it they murdered him in cold
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:15.840]  blood and they just and you know it's a message of those of us that can think
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:18.960]  yeah we killed him what's going to do about it all these sheep want to
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:21.520]  believe that the good government's running things
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:26.000]  i'm sorry i'm ranting sir that's okay no you have a right to do that and i
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.080]  and i respect you for that because we have to take a serious look at where
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:34.400]  we're going in this country and and the things that are happening
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:37.600]  are being surfaced by persons like yourself and glenn back to some other
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:41.280]  people in that we have to make the public aware that we've got a serious
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:44.160]  problem here and when you can when you can take the
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:47.120]  life of the president and do whatever you want with that
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:51.440]  uh from that point on there's nothing else that has to fear you has glenn
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:54.480]  back covered jfk i don't think so
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:58.720]  yeah i actually i mean he does do some good work i i'm sad i think i actually
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:02.240]  have seen videos of him criticizing it but but maybe he'll wake up
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:05.920]  uh maybe maybe he's going in the right direction there but i guess he is about
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:08.880]  as good as it gets in mainstream media it's just that
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:11.840]  you know maybe we should contact glenn back and try to get you on a show i mean
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:16.080]  you're a retired fbi agent we've got these tapes this is powerful evidence
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:18.640]  anything that you can do to help me to get there that's
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:23.200]  that's been my total motivation well we know listen listen if i wear a
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:27.840]  don't tread on me shirt under a suit he wears it uh you know if i do jokes and
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:30.640]  go i'm afraid you know he so don't worry
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:34.000]  glenn back's people are watching and listening right now and so i would ask
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.440]  them to have you on but sorry sir go ahead oh no that's fine i appreciate
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:40.160]  that very much but what i'm going to tell you is that
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:45.840]  the the the total uh picture of this thing to sum it up in that is
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:49.600]  oswald does not do the shooting and yet they spent over two thousand public
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:53.760]  places publications uh and naming him and saying that's him
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:58.640]  i just recently gave a talk and and as soon as i finished making my statement
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:01.200]  that he had a bull hole in his throat in his throat
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:04.400]  and that he didn't do the shooting because he was down in a break room
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:07.520]  at the exact moment that the shooting was taking place in that
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:10.480]  a person a lady was standing there and she says
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:14.880]  i know that oswald was a shooter and i know that that uh he was the person
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:18.240]  that committed the crime and she knows that the easter bunny is real as well
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:22.640]  exactly right exactly right so so it's it's uh
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:27.040]  sometimes uh it's defeating what you're trying to do
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:29.760]  but we have to understand that this stuff has been
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:34.080]  pounded into these people's heads for 47 years at oswald's shooter
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:37.920]  well by the way mr adams you go over the evidence but backing you up the
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:41.280]  parkland doctors put on the report he'd been shot in the throat
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:45.200]  but i don't need to hear it from the doctors you see him boom get hit in the
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:49.200]  throat and then he gets shot uh several more times i mean we
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:53.520]  know what happened but we have the doctor's own reports i mean he's a doctor
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:57.680]  krenshaw trot trot and then he he administered to him
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:00.400]  and first thing he went he walked into trauma room one was he
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:03.200]  as soon as they had the president laying there on the gurney he said
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:07.920]  hell he's got a bull hole in his throat and he didn't make his publication jfk
[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:13.840]  conspiracy of silence until 1992 and the reason that he waited that long
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:17.440]  was because he was afraid that he would lose his medical profession
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:21.040]  if he came forth with the truth well i've interviewed groody he came to one of
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:25.760]  my events and uh he of course was the um
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:31.920]  the undertaker okay and the fbi came in with lee harvey oswald put ink on his
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:35.440]  hand and to make sure the prince stayed there and
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:39.920]  put the prince on the rifle did you know that i had heard that i had heard that
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:43.600]  there was no there was no prince on the rifle that they were put on
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:47.360]  afterwards and i also know this that the first weapon that they
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:51.680]  found in there was a mouser and and and then all of a sudden the mouser
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:55.280]  disappears because there's a picture of a police officer holding a mouser up in
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:58.640]  here and the next thing it shows the picture of
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:02.480]  the man like a carcona as the as the fire i mean a weapon that
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:07.040]  that killed the president that but when you take if we sat down and we listed
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:10.640]  all these things alex and and marked him as
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:14.080]  as one item of evidence and that it would shock you
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:17.680]  oh i know they're just hundreds and hundreds and it sure and i mean i did
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:22.560]  i mean i've interviewed lbj's admitted mistress i mean it's it's all on record
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:26.160]  yeah i mean it's ridiculous about that meeting at merchants house
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:30.880]  when the hell do you ever find uh lbj and and president nixon in the same
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:36.640]  meeting with jerry hoover i mean at the bat merchants house and hl hunt there
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:39.920]  and when they said they walked out a woman overheard
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:45.440]  president albie uh lbj made a comment that uh that gd kennedy will never bother
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:48.160]  me again never embarrass me again
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:52.080]  yep now think about that but i mean with the knowledge that all these people
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:55.600]  had for so long you know he was defending the warn commission and warn
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:58.800]  commission was a joke listen i'm from austin
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:04.080]  okay and my family's been here uh since the fifties and
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:08.240]  you know all of these people involved got off on the power
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:12.240]  of lbj and all his gangsters and thugs they bragged they
[01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:16.640]  at cocktail parties they they might as well gone up on church
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:19.840]  roofs and beat their chest they're very proud of it
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:22.640]  sure i mean that's it that's an enjoyment for them and and then they
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:26.080]  know the sheeple want to suck their thumbs let's take a phone call andy and
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:29.520]  connecticut you're on the air with retired fb is in don adams go ahead
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:33.360]  how you doing um hi eddie i had a quick question for you i've always been
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:36.800]  interested in just i guess the truth uh real history is way more
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:39.360]  interesting than the stuff we learn in school
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:42.560]  when my father learned that i was getting into conspiracy theories
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:47.120]  as he would call him he got me into jfk because that was
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:51.120]  always of interest of his but he said that he will go to his grave
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:54.240]  knowing that as well did it and he sat me down and
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:57.760]  forget what news segment was but was like an hour long
[01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:04.080]  almost like recreated cgi saying we're gonna find out if there is a conspiracy
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:06.080]  theory because jfk was a great president we want to
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:10.960]  use fake evidence and all those i mean these are conspiracy theories we just
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:15.920]  gave you facts facts andy when you when you talk in
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:20.800]  terms it is andy right yes when you talk in terms of a bullet hole in a
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:25.040]  in in the president's throat and it doesn't exit the back of his neck
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:28.880]  uh because it went through a windshield and uh and i slowed the projector down
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:31.760]  to where it didn't go through his back through the back of his neck and that
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:37.200]  partially spent yes and then you had a president the future president of the
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:41.200]  united states gerald ford when he's on that commission he moves that bullet
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:45.040]  five inches up and two inches to the right to be able to put a hole in the
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:48.240]  back of the neck to be able to say that oswald shot him for the
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:53.280]  from the book of hot story so there's the i'm telling you a hundred percent
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:57.920]  believe me andy that uh oswald did andy stay there stay there everybody stay

[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:25.040]  defeating the carbon tax but andy i want to go to robert fred shannon
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:27.760]  wilson before our guest leaves us his websites
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:30.800]  adams jfk.com great information on the site
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:34.480]  and some dvds documenting this so you can have actual video interviews
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:38.800]  with our guest uh but andy does that answer your question i mean we have
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:42.800]  the former cia assassination team commander
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:49.600]  who overthrew more than ten countries e howard hunt on record deathbed
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:54.240]  confession video audio and written saying it was the big event they were
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:57.520]  going to kill him in miama they were going to kill him in
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:02.240]  chicago but they decided on dalis because good law enforcement continued to
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:05.760]  find out what was going out going on on the white side of things and stopping
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:09.280]  it i mean do you understand we just have bombshell evidence bombshell evidence
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:13.120]  bomb just stacking and stacking and stacking i mean
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:17.120]  what are you getting at here andy um i was just basically
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:20.960]  wondering if he sees any of those other reports
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:25.440]  would he consider them a hundred percent lies or do they try and mix in facts to
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:29.600]  to make it blurry but before he answers the question i quickly wanted to say
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:33.040]  i wasn't around when kennedy was shot so looking back at the news
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:37.920]  is is hard to judge so i think it's key that info wars is around right now
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:41.040]  because i'll tell friends if you want to watch
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:44.320]  the news you know a month behind things happening watch the news
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:47.280]  if you want to know things two months before they happen start listening to
[01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:51.200]  info wars so seeing the way politicians spend things now the
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:54.480]  way the news comes out it's totally believable
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:57.760]  that it would be all right thank you andy let me get a comment from uh
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:01.440]  yeah i just want to mention one other thing to andy andy you have to know
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:04.960]  one thing that my work has always been just
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:08.640]  nothing but pure facts i'm not speculating and i'm not
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:15.360]  turning the information around a pd officer by the name of baker
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:18.960]  excuse me i'm sorry pd officer by the name of baker and the superintendent of
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:23.920]  the texas school book depository and funded oswald
[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:27.200]  one second after the first shot was fired
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:30.320]  and he was down there drinking a coke in the coke coke room
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:33.920]  and three other employees who worked with oswald
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:38.560]  saw him there so my big goal is to eliminate oswald
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:41.920]  as even being a part of this thing he played a very heavy role
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:46.080]  as a pat cna to let him he was a cia operative that's now been declassified
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:50.800]  hung out to drive exactly right and all of you government
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:54.800]  operatives need to remember that and understand that when they got caught
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:58.000]  torturing we had the white house memos ordering it
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:01.920]  they sent the people to prison who did the torturing
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:05.760]  okay and then and then bush came out two months ago and said yeah i ordered the
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:09.600]  torture i do it again on tv people are in prison
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:13.600]  for doing that they will hang you out to dry remember that
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:19.200]  for all you operatives out there robert in illinois you're on the air go ahead
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:24.400]  robert drop fred in ohio go yes i've got two questions for don
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:29.200]  what was the five questions that he was allowed to ask malpair
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:34.240]  and what was the reason for the assassination i know that jfk moved
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:38.240]  against the fellow reserve board so i'd like to know that i'll hang up and
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:42.160]  listen to the answers thank you very much i'll answer as quickly as i can
[01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:45.920]  federal reserve board was a very important decision that was made
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:50.400]  and uh and that had a very heavy impact on it the second element that played a
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:54.320]  very heavy impact on it was to pull the troops out of vietnam
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:58.480]  when you take a country from military and put it back to civilian
[01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:03.280]  there's a tremendous loss to a lot of people as far as big dollars is concerned
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:07.280]  and so those two elements i think played a very very strong part i don't know the
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:09.840]  answer to this but i speculate that they were
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:13.440]  involved in making it getting getting that decision to
[01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:18.560]  to take him out because of that uh and that's the other thing that you asked
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:22.000]  was the five questions all the five questions
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:25.840]  uh well i'm gonna try to remember them as much as i can but one of them had to
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:29.360]  do with martin luther king when he was killed
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:33.440]  another one uh the second question needed just short paragraphs with answers
[01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:37.680]  stuff because i couldn't go into any say what stay there back in 70 seconds we'll
[01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:41.520]  finish that question then get to more calls
[01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:50.320]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:53.440]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:57.760]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:59:02.000]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.880]  how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:09.120]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:13.600]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:17.200]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:21.040]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:24.240]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:28.160]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:31.600]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really

[02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:39.440]  interview the questions you were allowed to ask mil tear
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:42.560]  were basically distractions from the real questions and that's why you thought
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:46.000]  it was a cover-up well he asked a question about the
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.640]  kenby assassination today having knowledge of it okay
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:52.160]  once he answered no on that i mean the question was done
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:56.320]  i couldn't probe into it uh what did what do you know as far as martin
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:00.240]  luther's uh martin luther king's direction as to where he was going
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:04.000]  uh it was same thing with that and then the bombing of the three children in
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.440]  birmingham alabama well what did he know about that
[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:11.840]  and he said he knew nothing about it yet we know from information developed
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:14.960]  after that that uh he had heavy discussion
[02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:18.320]  concerning the bombing of those three kids him in birmingham
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:22.400]  and uh and uh of course kennedy assassination and so on i mean and then
[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:27.120]  he died mysteriously let's jump to shannon in mississippi you're on the air
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:31.520]  hey how you doing alexa mr adams uh mr adams i just want to get straight to a
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:36.160]  question for you uh the man that phim that famous video
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:39.840]  that everybody has seen i watched it over and over and over
[02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:43.040]  i just wanted to ask you a question the man that phim that video
[02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:46.560]  was he ever investigated was he a part of the cia
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:50.240]  and also mr adams when those first shots were fired
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:54.400]  did anybody ever investigate or even look at the driver of the limo
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:57.920]  he took a wrong turn is it possible that maybe
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:02.160]  he could have fired that fatal shot and when it was fired
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:06.000]  uh missus jackiel nasses was trying to jump out of the back of the limo
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:10.640]  and then they put her back inside in limo just drives that's a lot of questions
[02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:15.600]  what was the what was the first one uh about the man that took that famous
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:21.200]  video yes a brooder okay um i saw the original
[02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:25.680]  the brooder film uh before it uh was changed and altered
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:29.840]  and uh the actual shot uh into the throat
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:33.600]  and the back of his head being blown off which you knew there was another
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:38.000]  shot from the front uh before that uh film that
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:42.160]  i watched which was a copy of the original before that went out into the
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:46.000]  public and started getting dissected and that as far as frames is concerned
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:52.240]  uh that was a legitimate and and those things did happen just as they showed
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:56.320]  yeah and from my research it's pure quackery
[02:02:56.320 --> 02:03:01.040]  that the driver turns around and shoots the president and i've blown up the
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:05.600]  video i've looked at it sure and uh he did stop the car twice
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:09.760]  and uh almost completely to a dead stop which is against that so clearly
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:12.480]  clearly in on it's what you're saying for sure
[02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:15.760]  well what i'm saying is what about turning around and shooting him
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:19.520]  no i that didn't happen and there's a lot of people that have movies and stuff
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:23.760]  of that and that did not happen but but yeah well the guy that put that out
[02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:27.840]  also said that he's seen videos that alien shot of the crucifixion of
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:31.280]  jesus so yeah yeah i can understand that now
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:34.400]  the thing is is that when this guy stops the car
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:39.600]  and does what he did uh that just troubles me terribly because these agents
[02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:43.760]  are trained to know exactly how to react in a minute that a report goes out from
[02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:46.640]  a weapon and that hell you get the hell out of there
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:50.080]  you don't stop the car and almost come to a complete stop well you don't send
[02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:53.760]  the president out uh when people are openly talking about killing him or
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:58.240]  you at least have the armored limousine but see all that stuff disappeared
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:01.680]  i mean they went to the secret service and it went to the fbi in washington went
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:04.800]  to the fbi all over and that alana knew about it
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:08.880]  my partner knew about it uh but i was never told
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:13.280]  and and all i'm saying is that because i was a new agent going into that office
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:17.360]  even though i was 32 years old had been through korea and everything else
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:21.680]  they thought that i was naive and i wouldn't pick up on any of that stuff
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:25.120]  and as a result of the scientific case to me because why would you give a
[02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:28.560]  i mean i was 13 years younger as far as service was concerned
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:32.080]  than the guy that i was working with and then why would you assign the case to me
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:37.440]  and then i find out later on many years later in 1993 94 or even later than that
[02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:41.520]  when we went to the archives then maron mcgroth did an investigation
[02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:47.280]  on miltear uh in 1962 a year before me all right we're out of time

[02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:24.640]  bunch of key news that ties into this bill gates admits
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:27.760]  there are death panels and they're a good idea
[02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:31.520]  obama's having to admit your insurance premiums are going to go up
[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:36.240]  it all ties into this environmental population reduction cult and now the
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:40.320]  un came out last week and said we're getting rid of the global warming hype
[02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:45.120]  we got a whole new group of scare tactics and we're going to target human
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:48.800]  population and so we've got to reduce that but then i've
[02:08:48.800 --> 02:08:51.760]  got a chinese government report saying their population has been
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:54.400]  decimated and it's screwing up their society
[02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:58.000]  here it is london independent china rethinks its controversial one-shot policy
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.120]  that's coming up after martin reino leaves us i tried to get to this on the
[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:05.120]  sunday show but didn't but we will cover that key intel coming up at the bottom
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:09.280]  of the hour uh martin reino runs the climate website climate depot dot com
[02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:13.520]  the premier side exposing this fraud uh for the committee for conservative
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:17.840]  tomorrow uh and of course uh he's also uh worked with the republicans on the
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:21.120]  u.s senate committee on environment and public works and it's really the guy
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:26.000]  that helped educate uh senator inhofe and others and work for him
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:29.920]  and i wanted to get mark on we've got lord montan on had known about a month
[02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:35.520]  and a half uh thursday for a full hour because
[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:39.600]  you've got pechari nine months ago saying climate gate wasn't even real
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:43.120]  now admitting okay we just made up all this stuff about melting
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:47.840]  himalayan uh glaciers and all the rest of it and we have hidden the decline
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:52.000]  but it's still for a good reason and yeah we made a lot of money moving
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:55.680]  industry out of western europe and england and the u.s to india but that's
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:09:59.520]  okay and now you have the un ipcc lead
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:03.440]  author rips ipcc's claims is outright false
[02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:07.360]  you have another ipcc leader a santa earlier last year saying
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:11.040]  yeah we took out other top authors who didn't agree with us and said there
[02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:15.760]  wasn't an increase in temperature actually a decline the last decade
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:19.120]  so all of this is going on but they don't care
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:22.480]  they still goes on the news and says peer reviewed
[02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:26.400]  not one scientist on earth disagrees you don't think the moon landings happen
[02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:30.480]  if you question us so i want him to he had been on
[02:10:30.480 --> 02:10:34.080]  four or five months recap all that's unfolded because if you thought climate
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:38.560]  gate was big it just gets more outrageous and more insane
[02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:42.320]  i mean just a gaggle of lying fraudsters who want to create a bunch of
[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:46.960]  collectivist taxes i've got cnbc reporting on world government
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:50.160]  funded by carbon taxes that you pay to private banks
[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:54.560]  made off ken lay al gore came up with a lot of these things i mean
[02:10:54.560 --> 02:11:00.640]  this is a group of swindling slime bags and martin marino joins us to go over
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:05.520]  uh and and chronicle all of this uh but meanwhile they're over in england saying
[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:10.160]  they want to arrest climate deniers and saying they want to make it illegal and
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:13.360]  saying we need to all over the british news we've we've read the headlines
[02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:17.200]  we need to get authoritarian if the public's too dumb to accept carbon
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:21.760]  uh tyranny we'll just force it on them i mean this is just a gaggle of crux that
[02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:25.040]  want to run our lives martin marino good to have you on with us
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:29.840]  hey thanks a lot happy to be here uh you interesting thing you brought this up
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:33.200]  about forcing it on us we had the new york times
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:38.480]  tom freedman uh who earlier this year lauded china's environmental policies and
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:42.160]  he said it and i quote tom freedman who lives in a mansion by the way in
[02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:46.400]  suburban maryland one party can just impose politically difficult but
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:50.400]  critically important policies needed to move a society forward in china
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:54.160]  unlike this messy democracy where they can be thwarted
[02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:58.000]  and what's interesting is right after he said that china came out and did all
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:03.440]  these draconian carbon uh limits on some of their industry and they had
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:07.040]  complete havoc people couldn't even flush the toilet in some parts of china
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:10.400]  i mean this is what they want they want a one party rule
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:14.080]  a green rule they openly talk about global governance but you asked for some
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:18.720]  of the updates here what is happening is hilarious i call it the dan rather
[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:22.960]  uh defense remember the bush national guard documents shown to be a forgery
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:26.240]  shown to be a hoax but dan rather's defense at the time was well you know
[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:29.440]  it really doesn't matter if the documents the story was accurate but the
[02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:32.640]  documents may have been false and what they've now done is they
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:38.000]  they the united nations ipcc climate panel that shared the nobel prize uh
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:41.840]  with the mesustin chief or without gore the former vice president
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:46.320]  they literally have now said yes there's all these errors and this was wrong and
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:49.920]  yes we admit that the government's hand picked the scientists that joined us
[02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:54.720]  and they'd only pick warmer scientists yes we admit that only dozens uh only a
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:58.320]  few dozen scientists actually looked at whether co2 actually has a warming
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:01.680]  impact yes we admit to all these different scandals and the new inquiry
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:06.080]  that came out um last couple weeks ago was really devastating to the un
[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:08.960]  but they're basically saying all that doesn't matter because we still got
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:13.920]  the science right sure we messed up the process sure we sure we had a bunch of
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:17.280]  con men doing this and sure we admit to this and sure this happened but it
[02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:20.640]  doesn't affect the underlying science it's the exact defense
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:24.880]  dan rather used back in 2004 saying the fake documents
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:28.400]  don't mean the story wasn't true and that's where the united nations is right
[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:32.480]  now and they expect us to take them seriously
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:36.320]  well mark i mean i mean going back here though
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:40.480]  um first they denied that climate gate was what it really was showing their
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:48.400]  internal fraud premeditatedly yes and now they're just still driving forward
[02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:54.400]  uh with all of this and how i mean how do we counter these people newt
[02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:59.360]  ginrich is still running around saying we need carbon taxes uh
[02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:03.760]  glenn beck told us say today that he thinks global warming is real
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:07.520]  i mean the issue is a lot of republicans
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:11.200]  and conservatives are still going along with this
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:14.800]  well i will say in terms of newt gingrich newt gingrich sat on a sofa
[02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:18.000]  with nancy polosi and he still defends that decision
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:21.280]  and an ad for al gore out in front of the capital that was outrageous i think
[02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:25.520]  the glenn beck quote i think that was in usa week and i believe beck was
[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:28.560]  being facetious with the reporter by saying he believes that the globe is
[02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:33.680]  warm but he still questions mankind's role um but in terms of you know looking
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:37.200]  at the that the political and scientific climate right now
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:41.600]  the movement is absolutely dead the problem is there's a thing called
[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:45.520]  zombies and the undead and this can be resurrected as quickly as a lame dug
[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:49.440]  session of congress as quickly as obama ordering his e p a to start
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:52.240]  regulating co2 because congress wouldn't do it
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:55.680]  so we're they've announced that they mean they've announced they've announced
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:57.840]  they're doing that they're going ahead with it
[02:14:57.840 --> 02:15:00.880]  they are they're trying to say it's going to be moderate watered down but there's
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:05.040]  a couple ways congress can try to pass a law uh restricting the e p a ability
[02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:08.560]  obama's already settled veto it and then all we're gonna have left with it are
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:12.400]  the court and of course the longer obama's in the more he gets to stack the
[02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:15.840]  courts and then particularly the supreme court which actually opened the door
[02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:19.360]  for this i think it was either 2007 or 2008 now the big supreme court case
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:23.040]  that allowed us to regulate co2 is a pollutant think about that
[02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:27.520]  for the first time in human history we're regulating what we exhale from our
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:30.640]  mouth co2 we inhale oxygen we exhale co2
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:34.560]  and now the united states govern the old expression they can't taxi air we breathe
[02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:38.400]  oh yes they can they're gonna be attacking what we exhale this is
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:43.840]  this is just the madness of our age and what's so funny is we've we've caught
[02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:47.360]  them red-handed we've caught them in scandal we've caught them in
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:51.040]  fraud we've caught them we caught them recanting we have scientists now switching
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:55.040]  we have a major left-wing scientist like dennis rancourt out of canada
[02:15:55.040 --> 02:15:58.560]  who now says global warming is nothing but an imaginary problem of the first
[02:15:58.560 --> 02:16:02.800]  world middle class uh major leftists are bailing saying they
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:06.320]  can't go on with this anymore because the movement is in tatters it was never
[02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:09.120]  should have been a movement and al gore is making them six
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:13.600]  meanwhile austin has passed stealth carbon taxes but they admit it
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:17.280]  2.6 billion over the next three years on power and gas
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:21.760]  they just don't care they just don't care all and i saw schwarzenegger
[02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:25.680]  during the Copenhagen summit he said i'm going to lead governors
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:29.760]  and mayors to save america we're going to do it
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:33.520]  and and so they just don't care they're just coming in swindling
[02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:36.800]  well here's the thing here that you know it's a con let's assume that the
[02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:39.760]  united nations is right let's assume al gore is right on the side but the
[02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:44.480]  civil arm of schwarzenegger is correct in the science even if you buy that
[02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:48.240]  the granddaddy of all the Kyoto protocol wouldn't even have a detectable impact
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:51.360]  on climate using their science the most shocking thing is
[02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:55.600]  we have professors here in the united states uh got named professor david
[02:16:55.600 --> 02:16:59.760]  uh professor brown coming out saying it's the greatest ethical scandal that
[02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:02.320]  washington didn't pass the climate bill in order to
[02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:06.720]  to bring us to a low carbon economy well obama's own apa administrative Lisa
[02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:10.800]  jackson admitted if the congressional climate bill became law
[02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:14.480]  not only would it not impact temperature it wouldn't even impact global co2
[02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:17.600]  levels in other words it's purely symbolic
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:21.120]  and yet we're told by barbara boxer we're told by president obama
[02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:25.200]  that the bill will prevent floods droughts hurricanes it's literally we've
[02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:28.560]  advanced no more than the ancient aztecs alex
[02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:32.480]  1450 or so they slaughtered thousands of Aztecs
[02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:36.400]  in order to bring about an ended drought and this is where we are now we think we
[02:17:36.400 --> 02:17:40.160]  can control by eliminating suv's and unplugging our phone chargers
[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:43.600]  and getting rid of coal and returning back that we can somehow control
[02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:47.520]  the weather this is no this is no more scientifically advanced
[02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:50.480]  what we're saying is a capital hill and from there what they did with the witch
[02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:54.240]  trial the bad crop let's blame a witch it's the witch is doing it they
[02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:58.160]  honestly believe we control the earth's thermostat this has become
[02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:01.360]  the madness of our age it's climate astrology
[02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:07.120]  well you're right by the mid-level minions kind of the outer court they
[02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:09.200]  really do believe it but when you read club of
[02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:12.480]  rome un and others it's all about population reduction
[02:18:12.480 --> 02:18:16.400]  and it's about government and and and select corporate mafias
[02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:20.480]  allowing certain industries to operate and others not to it's about them
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:24.800]  funding their buddies with federal and international money through so called
[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:29.360]  green job initiatives it's just the big city mafia model
[02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:32.400]  taking over the planet i mean at the end of the day
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:36.320]  the leadership of these groups from my research know exactly what they're doing
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:40.800]  can you expound on your research and and what the end game is for these people
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:44.000]  mark well the end game is they've they've decided
[02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:48.320]  they want a collective society and i'm talking about going back to 1960s
[02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:51.760]  what the environmental movement really is it's a collection of ragtag collection
[02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:56.160]  of this leftover radical hippies from the 1960s and i and i say that seriously
[02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:59.120]  if you look at the first earth day that's what it was that's what it was known as
[02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:02.000]  george willow and actually another commentator
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:05.520]  um... they did a great analysis of the entire green movement
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:09.520]  it's they've literally taken the word progress out of the progressive movement
[02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:14.320]  and so what this is this is a existence about bean counters about international
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:16.720]  bureaucrats and about a collectivism this is what
[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:21.120]  claud uh... uh... the block of applause the president check republican knows
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:24.240]  something about communism when he said the berlin wall fell in the soviet union
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:28.160]  collapse the greatest threat to freedom we face is from what he called ambitious
[02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:31.840]  environmentalism and what they've done since the late sixties forward
[02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:34.960]  is they've just plug it and they've just plug and play in other words
[02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:38.720]  every scare of the day had the same solutions
[02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:41.920]  and the same cause mankind and the same solutions we need more government
[02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:44.960]  more regularly stay there mark stay there stay there global government let's
[02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:48.240]  come back and talk about global government because in their own words
[02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:52.640]  once they get the carbon tyranny in place and could tax you for breathing
[02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:56.720]  they're going to tax the family out of existence these are human hating
[02:19:56.720 --> 02:20:01.040]  control freaks will be right back stay with us
[02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:04.240]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:08.240]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:10.720]  double or triple your electric bill number two
[02:20:10.720 --> 02:20:14.560]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:20:14.560 --> 02:20:18.640]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in
[02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:21.280]  the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:20:21.280 --> 02:20:24.960]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:28.000]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:31.840]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:20:31.840 --> 02:20:34.960]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:38.960]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:20:38.960 --> 02:20:41.760]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:44.880]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:47.600]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more

[02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:33.120]  accelerating at the quote independent school

[02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:08.880]  for it for having any wealth and just giving it all to these parasites so
[02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:12.080]  al gore can chase his masseuses around
[02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:15.200]  with his johnson flopping about i mean i'm sorry but that's what's going on
[02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:18.640]  here yeah you mentioned kids here there's a new
[02:25:18.640 --> 02:25:22.320]  uh pen and treasure brook shield film i think it's called furry revenge or
[02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:25.440]  something like that and it's all geared toward kids being upset at the
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:29.200]  at a development project a few years back there was a movie
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:34.160]  about a pancake house going up in south in florida
[02:25:34.160 --> 02:25:38.960]  and it was all about kids being taught to glorify eco-terrorism they went and
[02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:43.360]  they put in alligators on the site they to cause destruction they vandalize
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:46.160]  the site all to prevent the environment from being hurt
[02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:52.320]  this is hollywood mainstream hollywood uh carol heisian the author uh it was the
[02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:54.880]  one that wrote that book and it was made into a movie
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:25:58.160]  they're propagandizing our kids to be eco-terrorist
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:02.160]  they're building their malware games the discovery gunman didn't have this kind
[02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:04.800]  of propaganda when he was little so you can imagine where we're going to be
[02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:08.720]  30 years from now uh but it's absolutely if you look
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:12.000]  across the spectrum at what they were doing when we went to the break i was
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:16.160]  just explaining to you briefly is that they've had multiple eco-scares and
[02:26:16.160 --> 02:26:19.920]  when they fade away they just plug in a new one in the 1970s we had the over
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:24.320]  population scares we had uh resource scarcity prediction the famine you had
[02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:28.880]  pesticide scares dbt scares you had the man-made global cooling scares in the
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:32.480]  80s and 90s the at the amazon rainforest the deforestation
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:35.760]  getting all the kids sad at the monkeys going homeless their predictions the
[02:26:35.760 --> 02:26:39.440]  amazon will be gone by the way the amazon for every acre cut in the tropical
[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:42.880]  forest worldwide an estimated 50 or growing back people
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:46.240]  are leaving the jungle they're calling them the galloping jungle they're
[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:49.120]  growing so fast so that eco-scare faded away
[02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:53.040]  now with global warming fading away they have so much investment they're not
[02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:56.320]  going to let it fully fade away but right now the un has already come out
[02:26:56.320 --> 02:27:00.800]  and has a new climate a new biodiversity panel modeled after
[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:04.640]  the ipcc panel and by the way it's exactly modeled because there's been
[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:08.320]  analysis done multiple errors all about the species in fact on climate
[02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:12.880]  depot today i have an article on the uh species extinction what they've done
[02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:16.480]  it's the same solution different eco-scare now we're taking all your
[02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:19.440]  property because of a cave bug or a bat or a salamander
[02:27:19.440 --> 02:27:23.680]  they're uh they've caught the epa in the forestry service releasing endangered
[02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:26.160]  animals in areas where they weren't geographically
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:29.920]  as a pretext to land grab so they're going back to that tried and trusted
[02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:34.320]  we got to take your your your power we've got to have you pay us taxes
[02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:37.600]  or the polar bears will die it doesn't matter if their numbers are exploding
[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:39.920]  off the charts they'll just tell you they're all dead
[02:27:39.920 --> 02:27:43.680]  they're teaching children in public schools that penguins are drowning
[02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:47.520]  when they're aquatic birds oh yeah no they're what they're teaching them
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:52.080]  public it's a it's a crime uh and in fact it's become what i call
[02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:57.040]  climate astrology anything in 2007 the un basically said
[02:27:57.040 --> 02:28:02.480]  many bad things will happen and guess what bad things always happen and now
[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:06.240]  every time a bad thing happens it's proof that the un
[02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:09.840]  is the new nostradamus of our age everyone looks so well the un predicted
[02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:13.440]  that we have a debbie stab it on the michigan senator who now says she
[02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:16.880]  believes in man-made global warming because every time she flies
[02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:20.640]  the turbulence is worse she feels global warming when she flies in the form of
[02:28:20.640 --> 02:28:24.000]  worst turbulence she doesn't remember airline turbulence so it's total
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.480]  paranoid voodoo let me throw this in before we go to break come back and
[02:28:26.480 --> 02:28:29.360]  get into population reduction and their numbers on that front because i know
[02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:33.600]  you're an expert in that area uh what about uh all these other
[02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:36.880]  things that have been uh uh proven wrong i mean i mean
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:40.880]  there's so many other things that they have uh predicted were going to happen
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:44.480]  uh that haven't happened yeah i mean going back
[02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:47.600]  the dbt scare not only was it scientifically baseless
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:52.320]  but it probably cost millions of lives of people in africa who couldn't face
[02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:55.120]  malaria and not only that it's inconvenient thing a lot of people in
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:28:58.800]  big cities today with the explosion of bed bugs because we're not allowed to
[02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:03.040]  use dbt to kill bed bugs is by the most effective tool against bed bugs
[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:06.320]  you go back to 1970 remember we mentioned the global cooling scare which
[02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:10.880]  faded away by the late 70s then you have uh the the um
[02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:14.560]  resource scarcity famines we have such outrageous predictions that we were
[02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:17.600]  using up the earth that we wouldn't have enough food to feed everyone that we
[02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:21.680]  were going to be facing you know wars and conflicts based on food resources
[02:29:21.680 --> 02:29:25.280]  all bogus everything they predicted has collapsed
[02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:28.720]  the tropical rainforest across the port every even down to
[02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:32.560]  our apples you can't trust them whatever something turns into a quote

[02:31:03.760 --> 02:31:07.520]  power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:31:07.520 --> 02:31:11.200]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:31:11.200 --> 02:31:14.880]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:31:14.880 --> 02:31:19.120]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:31:19.120 --> 02:31:22.720]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[02:31:22.720 --> 02:31:27.200]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:31:27.200 --> 02:31:31.040]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:31:31.040 --> 02:31:34.640]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[02:31:34.640 --> 02:31:38.560]  from weather-related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[02:33:07.920 --> 02:33:12.800]  of tyranny over the mind of man thomas jefferson
[02:33:12.800 --> 02:33:18.400]  it's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[02:33:18.400 --> 02:33:22.880]  our websites on the front line stopping this globalist takeover info
[02:33:22.880 --> 02:33:28.320]  wars.com and prismbunna.com climate depot.com is the
[02:33:28.320 --> 02:33:31.680]  central clearinghouse for exposing this eugenesis
[02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:36.160]  fraud i want to get into china rethinks its controversial one child policy
[02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:39.040]  and they go on to admit here that rich people are already allowed to have more
[02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:42.080]  than one child party members could do whatever they wanted
[02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:44.960]  but that now they don't have enough young people
[02:33:44.960 --> 02:33:48.480]  to pay for the social welfare net even though it's tiny in china
[02:33:48.480 --> 02:33:51.520]  and that they're talking about getting rid of it because they've dropped below
[02:33:51.520 --> 02:33:56.080]  1.7 replacement rate the average westerners 1.3
[02:33:56.080 --> 02:34:00.000]  you have two adults and they don't replace themselves they have 1.3
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.720]  children on average the united states has that
[02:34:02.720 --> 02:34:06.480]  average except for our giant immigrant influx we're dying
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:11.040]  but there i was in a convenience store friday
[02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:15.200]  and i'm up at the counter and they're talking about how they're about to ban
[02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:18.320]  plastic bags in austin and i've read the studies about how pulp
[02:34:18.320 --> 02:34:22.160]  causes more toxins more chemicals more acid
[02:34:22.160 --> 02:34:25.760]  more problems they don't care it's about making you take their light bulbs
[02:34:25.760 --> 02:34:28.640]  making you accept what type of toilet you can have
[02:34:28.640 --> 02:34:31.200]  making you accept federal inspections of your house
[02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:34.640]  making you accept no plastic bags it's about them
[02:34:34.640 --> 02:34:38.800]  being the bosses going back to mark marino mark how do
[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:44.000]  a how do we stop these people and b get into population reduction because from
[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:47.680]  my research that's the heart of what they're all about
[02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:52.080]  yeah well first of all i had to stop the most single effective thing americans
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:54.560]  did to stop the congressional climate bill
[02:34:54.560 --> 02:34:58.000]  was one well two words mockery and ridicule
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:02.400]  and it wasn't the tea parties it was the town halls in the summer of 2009
[02:35:02.400 --> 02:35:05.280]  when congressman went home to their districts having just voted and
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:09.280]  including some republicans like sunny bonos widow just voting for the
[02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:11.600]  congressional cabin trade bill they were booed
[02:35:11.600 --> 02:35:15.680]  cheered ridiculed laughed at in town halls when they tried to talk about
[02:35:15.680 --> 02:35:19.440]  global warming and the alleged consensus that had more of an impact that's
[02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:22.080]  scared u.s. senators that scared people like
[02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:28.400]  um uh which is named in minnesota out frankin to run scared and bail out of
[02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:32.240]  the global warming bill i mean hardcore leftist got so afraid of public
[02:35:32.240 --> 02:35:35.200]  outrage so that's one of the biggest things we can do out gordon i'll give
[02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:38.880]  speeches in oregon florida he's booed out of the hall we have hundreds of
[02:35:38.880 --> 02:35:41.920]  protesters out there chanting interrupting a speech
[02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:45.840]  civility has to go out the window confront your congressman confront your
[02:35:45.840 --> 02:35:49.200]  local officials don't let them have a moment
[02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:52.560]  a moral superiority when it comes to global warming tell them you know they
[02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:56.640]  love their fake moral superiority their arrogantness
[02:35:56.640 --> 02:35:59.760]  and unpopulation here's the bottom line major
[02:35:59.760 --> 02:36:04.320]  um leftist publication like grist magazine this is a magazine in 2006
[02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:07.840]  said we should have nirnberg style trials for global warming skeptics
[02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:11.120]  are now finding some intellectual honesty one of the most recent article
[02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:13.760]  this was in july right at fred pierce through the leftist
[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:18.400]  you know global warming believer quote the population bomb i remember being
[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:21.680]  scared of 40 years ago is it's been diffused
[02:36:21.680 --> 02:36:25.600]  fast and he said it doesn't fit the doomsday agenda now and you have the
[02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:28.480]  world now it's fewer than replace the level of children
[02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:31.680]  half the world the new population problem is
[02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:35.920]  under population and we have a man named paul erlich the godfather of this
[02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:39.360]  movement and i actually did a what i call a quote accurate tribute to him he's
[02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:43.600]  the father of the overpopulation movement here's the accurate tribute mad
[02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:47.920]  kook lunatic disgrace worsten hitler fair monger parasite on the academic
[02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:50.560]  system and the burning made off of science
[02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:54.960]  unquote this was a guy who called for forced sterilization in our
[02:36:54.960 --> 02:36:59.120]  adding forced sterilization agents to our water to keep population down this is
[02:36:59.120 --> 02:37:02.480]  a guy who called for the deep development of the united states this is a
[02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:05.680]  hardcore ideology and we have added a head of
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:09.600]  nasa right now the nasa goddard space institute that
[02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:14.000]  the gift studies james hanson the world the u.s. is lead global warming
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:17.200]  alarmist destroy industrial society is the goal
[02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:20.880]  he's endorsing a book calling for the deindustrialization of the u.s. that's
[02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:24.320]  called for destroying dams and essentially bombing us back to the
[02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:28.160]  stone age this is a net head nasa warming scientists and the media
[02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:33.280]  ignores that this permeates their entire existence but see mark that's it
[02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:39.600]  it is a shielded paramilitary inch by inch takeover
[02:37:39.600 --> 02:37:44.400]  fully conquering and enslaving humanity these people are the ultimate
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:48.560]  tyrants and they're calling for our arrest you have been demonized
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:52.240]  specifically lord montan they have called for his arrest
[02:37:52.240 --> 02:37:55.920]  these people are flaming out of the closet
[02:37:55.920 --> 02:38:00.000]  nazi tyrant scum and you're right we've got to get in their face and say
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:04.240]  listen you little bloodthirsty tyrant you tried to figure out how to repackage
[02:38:04.240 --> 02:38:07.360]  slavery and it ain't gonna work scumbag
[02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:10.720]  well here's a byline and this goes to co2 because actually one of the leftist
[02:38:10.720 --> 02:38:14.480]  george mondia and england just recanted veganism
[02:38:14.480 --> 02:38:18.240]  and here's the analysis you control what people eat you control people
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:22.000]  you control co2 what we exhale from our mouth you control
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:25.760]  people climate control is not about controlling the weather it's about
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:31.120]  controlling people it always has been that's why the united nations was formed
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:35.840]  to come up with a a fake scientific issue that they could then
[02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:39.280]  peddle as though the science was settled and then come up with alleged
[02:38:39.280 --> 02:38:43.040]  solutions and oddly enough all the solutions had to do with the un
[02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:47.280]  bureaucratic gaining power money carbon taxes one german
[02:38:47.280 --> 02:38:51.280]  science advisor went to co2 budget for every man a woman and child
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:56.320]  on the planet what carbon rations right and guess what americans were currently
[02:38:56.320 --> 02:38:59.840]  at you know four times our acceptable level of carbon emissions
[02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:03.520]  and interestingly enough on population on climate depot today alex
[02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:08.320]  i have a picture of the gerber baby with a a rifle scope target on its face
[02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:12.400]  the bottom line is they don't really care the leftist and the environmentalist
[02:39:12.400 --> 02:39:15.680]  don't care that much about the little black and the brown babies being
[02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:19.120]  warned about born born around the world in fact they're actually trying to
[02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:22.800]  stop their development what they're most concerned with are the western europeans
[02:39:22.800 --> 02:39:26.320]  and the american uh... babies that have that come into the world
[02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:30.480]  with our lifestyle with western lifestyles that's what terrifies them
[02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:33.760]  because the earth can't handle it so they're trying to stop our babies more
[02:39:33.760 --> 02:39:36.080]  than anything from being born at the same time
[02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:40.400]  they're locking in 1.6 billion people predominantly of color
[02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:44.560]  into a backbreaking existence of poverty we have james cameron by the way who
[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:48.400]  chickened out of a debate last month in an aspect of the last minute my flight
[02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:51.280]  was in midair he was supposed to schedule the debate me and andrew brye barton
[02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:55.120]  and macklanny irish filmmaker he went down to brazil
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:39:58.800]  this is a guy who lives in a 16 000 square foot house one of his homes is
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:02.240]  16 000 square foot the director of avatar and titanic james cameron
[02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:06.720]  he goes down with sigourney weaver to brazil the leftist president lula by
[02:40:06.720 --> 02:40:09.440]  the way friends of shugo chavez and friends of cash row
[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:13.680]  no right winger no oil funded president laughs at
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:17.600]  uh... james cameron who goes down and stops development projects a hydroelectric
[02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:19.840]  dam that would bring running water electricity
[02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:24.320]  ultimately the millions of brazilians he flies down with a hollywood actress
[02:40:24.320 --> 02:40:27.760]  tried to prevent this development and then flies over to his 16 000 square
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:32.400]  foot mansion where are people hinting at the racism involved
[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:36.400]  white wealthy westerners going into countries were dominated by people of
[02:40:36.400 --> 02:40:39.680]  color telling them they can't have what we have
[02:40:39.680 --> 02:40:43.360]  uh... in fact jerry brown in california i interviewed him at an earth summit in
[02:40:43.360 --> 02:40:46.240]  south africa johannesburg south africa 2002
[02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:50.240]  he said the developing world can't emulate western prosperity
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:53.520]  because the earth couldn't handle it we need something like five or 20 more
[02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:56.640]  earths well the bottom line is that is the equivalent of
[02:40:56.640 --> 02:40:59.840]  telling people in africa living in huts native dung
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:03.840]  that they can't advance they can't have what we have it's condemning their
[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:07.200]  children to high infant mortality them to a life that's so
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:10.880]  loss if they're so worried about overpopulation that's right
[02:41:10.880 --> 02:41:15.040]  every time you industrialized births go into negative
[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:18.640]  exactly because that's exactly what happened the wealth of the country to get
[02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:22.960]  the less population you think they'd be they'd be they'd be out there clamoring
[02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:26.320]  for the for the people's back to margaret singer
[02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:29.760]  but every single person who's on this bandwagon including
[02:41:29.760 --> 02:41:34.160]  oprah Winfrey john travolta the trapezius quarterback tom brady sadly
[02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:37.680]  has been praising albore live in mansions with square footage
[02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:41.760]  you know in excess of 10 000 square feet all of these people
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:46.640]  are basically advocating poverty misery and death and destruction for people in
[02:41:46.640 --> 02:41:50.640]  developing world or at best subsidized no they're a bunch of greedy
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:54.320]  greedy criminals and you go back to margaret singer
[02:41:54.320 --> 02:41:57.840]  saying we've got opposes liberals to kill these weeds
[02:41:57.840 --> 02:42:02.720]  and they hate black people they hate brown people they're a bunch of racist
[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:07.680]  and as soon as so-called minorities figure this out they'll have the key to
[02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:10.800]  everything they'll understand a real racist
[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:14.160]  didn't some toothless drunk wearing a white hat that's an idiot
[02:42:14.160 --> 02:42:19.280]  who is a racist the hardcore racist saddle up to you with a loving little
[02:42:19.280 --> 02:42:23.200]  simpering mpr voice and they're out there celebrating the
[02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:26.800]  the recession depression saying it'll lower our carbon footprint
[02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:32.640]  these are life-hating scum parasites yeah in fact
[02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:36.240]  robert redford was called out by black ministers about two years ago they
[02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:39.920]  protested at a sundance film festival basically saying that robert
[02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:44.720]  redford's environmental advocacy is racist to people of color
[02:42:44.720 --> 02:42:48.240]  in other words he is his policies that robert redford the hollywood actor
[02:42:48.240 --> 02:42:51.280]  advocates would raise energy prices and guess what
[02:42:51.280 --> 02:42:55.040]  who does that affect most seniors and fixed income and minorities
[02:42:55.040 --> 02:42:59.200]  uh who are generally poorer in our society they pay a higher percentage
[02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:02.320]  for these higher energy bills so that guilty white liberals
[02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:05.680]  can feel like they're doing something give the christians but they're not even
[02:43:05.680 --> 02:43:10.560]  guilty white liberals i've talked to them they hate poor people
[02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:14.640]  they hate working americans they are they just love the
[02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:18.480]  cutting stuff off to people martin merino incredible interview thanks to the
[02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:20.400]  great worker doing over at climate depot

[02:43:24.080 --> 02:43:27.760]  route out these 21st century nazis well thanks a lot we have the big
[02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:31.200]  un climate summit coming up in uh december so we hope to talk
[02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:34.800]  we'll talk before then that'll be the big their last gas try to get us to do

[02:43:38.400 --> 02:43:42.480]  ladies and gentlemen everything he said was true everything he said was true i
[02:43:42.480 --> 02:43:46.240]  mean i have to look at these murdering criminals every day
[02:43:46.240 --> 02:43:50.400]  do you know they told the third world oh we're gonna tax rich america in europe
[02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:54.960]  and give you the money and they got to copenhagen and they gave them the treaty
[02:43:54.960 --> 02:43:58.800]  and it said more taxes on the third world than even on the west
[02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:02.800]  it has nothing to do with the earth
[02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:06.000]  you notice the federal government's approved gmo salmon to be released
[02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:09.840]  in every study they will extinct the regular salmon within 40 generations
[02:44:09.840 --> 02:44:13.280]  that's 40 years they don't care about that
[02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:16.560]  they don't care about du they don't care about real problems
[02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:23.040]  they want you to be their slaves period now i want to get into this china
[02:44:23.040 --> 02:44:25.520]  situation we've already covered some of it we're almost out of time
[02:44:25.520 --> 02:44:32.880]  man i have to go back to four hours here but um
[02:44:32.880 --> 02:44:36.240]  i want to get into this bill gates situation here in just a moment i i'm
[02:44:36.240 --> 02:44:39.280]  going to talk more about this tomorrow because i've seen him his dad was they
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:43.280]  had a planned parenthood he's a eugenicist his whole program isn't
[02:44:43.280 --> 02:44:45.840]  about helping africans but you have to go research it it's
[02:44:45.840 --> 02:44:49.440]  vaccines that sterilize you it's now all out in the open we're gonna get to that
[02:44:49.440 --> 02:44:53.040]  moment he said yeah these are death panels
[02:44:53.040 --> 02:44:56.960]  that's what they do in england folks
[02:44:56.960 --> 02:45:00.640]  it's such a big subject because i know we have listeners who buy into all this
[02:45:00.640 --> 02:45:03.520]  they're training you that well if an old person's going to get health care
[02:45:03.520 --> 02:45:07.200]  you're not going to get yours see they limit the resources artificially
[02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:10.560]  instead of realizing in a free market economy it grows and grows as there's
[02:45:10.560 --> 02:45:14.480]  more need there's more business that it's unlimited what we can do in the
[02:45:14.480 --> 02:45:19.760]  economy and they say we've got to do this
[02:45:19.760 --> 02:45:23.680]  or the earth is going to die or we've got to have a one-child policy or the
[02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:27.120]  earth's going to you know basically implode and and and and all these islands
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:30.320]  in the pacific are going to are going to go under water and it turns out they're
[02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:33.280]  actually getting bigger in fact guys i actually pulled that article up
[02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:37.600]  earlier i wanted to show people uh on prism planet dot tv
[02:45:37.600 --> 02:45:42.080]  the actual headline here coral islands bigger
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:47.200]  and it says that all over the pacific the atolls are getting bigger not smaller
[02:45:47.200 --> 02:45:51.120]  the ocean level isn't going up ladies and gentlemen it's all lies
[02:45:51.120 --> 02:45:55.680]  but bill gaige uses an extreme example of some old person costing millions of
[02:45:55.680 --> 02:45:58.960]  dollars and so other people don't get health care
[02:45:58.960 --> 02:46:02.880]  and he admits yes these federal boards they will decide if you get the health
[02:46:02.880 --> 02:46:07.440]  care and they will withhold it see right now you can go
[02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:11.040]  and get charity care by law but they won't tell citizens that
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:14.720]  that you can get free health care they give it to the illegal aliens because
[02:46:14.720 --> 02:46:18.400]  they want to bring them in here and then bill gaige uses an extreme
[02:46:18.400 --> 02:46:20.720]  example of well there's millions for this old person
[02:46:20.720 --> 02:46:23.680]  so there isn't money for all of these young people
[02:46:23.680 --> 02:46:27.520]  and they sell you on the idea of taking old people or sick people and just
[02:46:27.520 --> 02:46:30.480]  giving them morphine till they die and i mean that was in the wall street
[02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:32.640]  journal a decade ago this has been going on
[02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:36.640]  in the u.s they kill people every day they deny them food and water while
[02:46:36.640 --> 02:46:39.600]  they're chained down begging if they're wards of the state
[02:46:39.600 --> 02:46:44.560]  you understand this is going on now but obama told you there's no death panels
[02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:49.520]  it's a conspiracy theory here's bill gates on national television
[02:46:49.520 --> 02:46:52.880]  promoting it this is the eugenesis this is the guy
[02:46:52.880 --> 02:46:56.560]  jack in your vaccines here he is
[02:46:57.440 --> 02:47:02.320]  oh we had a computer crash there all right today i think we got computers from
[02:47:02.320 --> 02:47:07.120]  other planet or something all right well it's up on

[02:47:15.600 --> 02:47:18.720]  just get into this right now china re-thinks it's controversial one
[02:47:18.720 --> 02:47:22.800]  child policy london independent and i also have it uh
[02:47:22.800 --> 02:47:25.760]  from a bunch of other mainstream news articles you can just search the term
[02:47:25.760 --> 02:47:29.520]  china re-thinks it's controversial one child policy
[02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:32.800]  and it goes on from there the country social engineering has been too successful
[02:47:32.800 --> 02:47:38.160]  reports cliford kunan in beijing so notice they don't say forced
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:42.400]  abortions bad sterilizations bad people that criticize it being secretly
[02:47:42.400 --> 02:47:44.800]  arrested as bad oh they admit all that in the article
[02:47:44.800 --> 02:47:48.560]  but it's just a government policy it's it's no big deal
[02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:51.440]  it says the country social engineering has been too successful
[02:47:51.440 --> 02:47:54.800]  china's one child policy probably the most audacious exercise of social
[02:47:54.800 --> 02:47:58.160]  engineering the world has ever seen could be up for review as beijing
[02:47:58.160 --> 02:48:02.000]  policymakers worry about the effects of a population aging fast with
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:05.440]  insufficient numbers of youngsters to support them under the one child
[02:48:05.440 --> 02:48:09.760]  policy imposed as a way of reigning in population growth which was running at
[02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:12.960]  dangerously high levels in the world's most populist nation
[02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:17.920]  most families were limited to one child the aim was to reduce fertility to 1.7
[02:48:17.920 --> 02:48:20.880]  children per family so that's less than a
[02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:24.480]  replacement rate replacement rates about 2.2 because about 0.2 percent end up
[02:48:24.480 --> 02:48:29.200]  dying of car wrecks or disease so either 2.2 to just replace yourself
[02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:32.880]  the aim was to reduce fertility rates to 1.7 children per family because this
[02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:36.000]  was seen as the only way of improving living standards at first couples were
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:39.120]  encouraged through education and propaganda they don't tell you the us
[02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:43.200]  funded them to do this to have a one child but this soon gave way to tougher
[02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:46.640]  measures in the early 1980s saw widespread sterilization especially
[02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:50.320]  among women in rural areas so remember
[02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:53.920]  they're now wanting to have taxes on more than one child in the u.s
[02:48:53.920 --> 02:49:00.080]  that's how it began in 75 in china five years later it was for sterilization
[02:49:00.080 --> 02:49:04.800]  this still goes on today and the issue is a contentious as ever
[02:49:04.800 --> 02:49:10.960]  shin gwang ching a blind activist who was released from jail
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:15.120]  this week was in prison in 2006 after he wrote a report
[02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:18.560]  about the status of women in his local area of linyae
[02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:22.640]  this is the tyranny of china folks a region with some 10 million residents
[02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:25.920]  in it he revealed how tens of thousands of people who had any
[02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:29.440]  legal number of children were ineligible to have any more
[02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:33.680]  were compelled to undergo late term abortions with others forcibly sterilized
[02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:38.080]  this is your liberalism folks the report included accounts of men arrested
[02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:41.520]  and their wives forced to abort eight months into their pregnancies
[02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:44.560]  isn't that liberal and loving and they're proposing that here
[02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:48.160]  the report included accounts of men arrested and their wives forced to
[02:49:48.160 --> 02:49:51.680]  abort eight months in the pregnancies the policy has also led to serious
[02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:56.640]  gender imbalance with 120 boys every hundred girls
[02:49:57.840 --> 02:50:02.480]  what is that you know there's 10 more boys china's working population will
[02:50:02.480 --> 02:50:08.080]  fall by around 10 million people a year every year
[02:50:08.080 --> 02:50:11.760]  after 2025 the number of young people between 2024 will drop
[02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:15.280]  by a quarter over the next decade young people of the age group
[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:18.320]  are most energetic productive and willing to learn
[02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:22.880]  china's already experiencing a shortfall of skilled workers
[02:50:22.880 --> 02:50:28.320]  and it just goes on to say uh that it's going to completely collapse their
[02:50:28.320 --> 02:50:31.600]  economy you've got to at least replace yourself
[02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:34.480]  they train all these yuppies and not want to have children missing out on the
[02:50:34.480 --> 02:50:36.720]  greatest thing in life and you won't have somebody there at
[02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:40.240]  Thanksgiving when you're 65 you won't have somebody there to keep you out of
[02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:42.800]  a government dormitory where they're going to euthanize you
[02:50:42.800 --> 02:50:46.160]  the globalists want to destroy the family re-engineer society
[02:50:46.160 --> 02:50:49.760]  they don't want you to have kids to stand up for you when you're old

[02:54:03.920 --> 02:54:09.440]  all right final segment so bill gates heading up this nsa takeover grid the
[02:54:09.440 --> 02:54:13.440]  retina scanners the control the surveillance the
[02:54:13.440 --> 02:54:18.000]  predictive systems the big banks imploding the economy funding all the
[02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:23.040]  environmental carbon taxes all of this is going on
[02:54:23.040 --> 02:54:27.360]  and they know that you have an artificial hallucination we all do
[02:54:27.360 --> 02:54:30.720]  because 90 percent in every industrialized country
[02:54:30.720 --> 02:54:34.080]  some cases even more some countries are 93 percent
[02:54:34.080 --> 02:54:41.360]  in urban that you live in mega cities and so all you see is people in lines
[02:54:41.360 --> 02:54:45.360]  and my analogy is if you're scuba diving off the coast of cancun
[02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:49.360]  you may go 10 miles in a boat before you see any coral
[02:54:49.360 --> 02:54:52.720]  and you wouldn't hardly see any fish out there but as soon as you had a coral
[02:54:52.720 --> 02:54:57.200]  reef you'll see tens of thousands of fish animals tend to congregate
[02:54:57.200 --> 02:55:01.600]  together in ecosystems so we congregate together
[02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:05.200]  and so it creates this perception that we're overpopulated
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:09.440]  but even if we were overpopulated if you believe eight billion is it's going to
[02:55:09.440 --> 02:55:13.760]  plane out at around eight and a half billion in the next 10 years
[02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:18.320]  and then it's going to start going down all of the actuary show
[02:55:18.320 --> 02:55:21.520]  china is going down to going down too fast
[02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:25.120]  it's screwing up their society but here's bill gates
[02:55:25.120 --> 02:55:28.960]  for you to get health care we got a killing old lady and yeah
[02:55:28.960 --> 02:55:33.680]  it is a death panel federal boards changing medicine
[02:55:33.680 --> 02:55:37.440]  and making sure you can't get charity care lying to you and saying you don't
[02:55:37.440 --> 02:55:39.920]  get coverage keeping people ignorant where they
[02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:43.440]  don't get coverage or don't get care and then their
[02:55:43.440 --> 02:55:46.480]  answer is let the government take over and start killing people
[02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:50.240]  here it is that's a trainoff society is making because
[02:55:50.240 --> 02:55:55.200]  of very very high medical costs and a lack of willingness to say
[02:55:55.200 --> 02:55:58.560]  you know is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for
[02:55:58.560 --> 02:56:02.400]  that patient would it be better not to lay off
[02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:07.280]  the those 10 teachers and to make that tradeoff in medical costs but that's
[02:56:07.280 --> 02:56:10.400]  called the death panel and you're not supposed to have that
[02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:14.160]  discussion so you of course that's an interesting
[02:56:14.160 --> 02:56:18.480]  than you just said would you just the last three months in life for one person
[02:56:18.480 --> 02:56:22.000]  or something because we haven't had a discussion of how
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:26.640]  to allocate that money it means we lay off three teachers to do so
[02:56:26.640 --> 02:56:29.920]  i mean in other words we haven't had this type of allocation
[02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:34.560]  we're making that tradeoff because of huge medical costs that are not
[02:56:34.560 --> 02:56:38.240]  examined to see which one okay that's enough you have no benefit it goes on
[02:56:38.240 --> 02:56:41.360]  and on if you want to see the whole thing it's up at prisonplanet.com
[02:56:41.360 --> 02:56:45.040]  but bill gates admits death panels now notice the message he sends to these
[02:56:45.040 --> 02:56:48.240]  teachers you got some 30 thousand 40 thousand
[02:56:48.240 --> 02:56:51.680]  dollar a year teacher and he tells him or her
[02:56:51.680 --> 02:56:54.640]  you're gonna get laid off if we don't kill grandma
[02:56:54.640 --> 02:56:57.680]  remember the case for killing granny the cover of newsweek
[02:56:57.680 --> 02:57:00.880]  how great it is other articles in newsweek how great it is people are
[02:57:00.880 --> 02:57:04.400]  committing suicide for the earth families killing themselves shooting
[02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:09.360]  their children oh beautiful beautiful bill gates has
[02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:13.520]  some 40 000 square foot house i saw reported
[02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:19.600]  this is a total doctor evil you're dealing with here
[02:57:19.600 --> 02:57:23.120]  and they're sending the message that they communalize
[02:57:23.120 --> 02:57:29.440]  they collectivize the wealth and then they limit the resources that's what
[02:57:29.440 --> 02:57:33.200]  carbon taxes are all about and then they say you're not allowed to
[02:57:33.200 --> 02:57:36.400]  have health care even if you can pay for it
[02:57:36.400 --> 02:57:41.840]  and then i was talking to rob Jacobson just the other day you know i he wants
[02:57:41.840 --> 02:57:44.480]  to come on the show and talk about it but i explained to him
[02:57:44.480 --> 02:57:47.600]  five years ago when he didn't even work for me and he was literally
[02:57:47.600 --> 02:57:51.200]  losing weight every day crones disease probably gonna die
[02:57:51.200 --> 02:57:54.160]  and that's what the doctors were telling him that he didn't you know he could
[02:57:54.160 --> 02:57:57.120]  die in a few years if this continued they wouldn't give him any care they said
[02:57:57.120 --> 02:58:01.600]  you know you're uninsurable and i said rob it's charity care and he got
[02:58:01.600 --> 02:58:05.200]  his full surgery everything paid for and he just told one of his friends
[02:58:05.200 --> 02:58:08.160]  a young lady who had to have surgeries thought she owed
[02:58:08.160 --> 02:58:11.840]  eighty thousand dollars and the charity care paid for eighty five thousand
[02:58:11.840 --> 02:58:16.160]  dollars because they pay you have to pay more
[02:58:16.160 --> 02:58:19.920]  when you have good insurance and that's put in a fund and all these good people
[02:58:19.920 --> 02:58:22.560]  donate to charity hospitals just like ron paul has said
[02:58:22.560 --> 02:58:26.240]  that there's nobody goes without health care unless they're not told about this
[02:58:26.240 --> 02:58:30.400]  he worked for years in a charity hospital making five dollars an hour
[02:58:30.400 --> 02:58:35.600]  five dollars an hour the doctors are supposed to donate their time to do
[02:58:35.600 --> 02:58:38.000]  this all right we're out of time god bless you all
[02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:51.360]  retransmission comes up info wars dot com great job croob
