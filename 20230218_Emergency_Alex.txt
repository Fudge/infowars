[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.280]  bringing you information this powerful and i hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.840]  by minute because i've had chills uh since last night the question is will you have the courage
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.840]  to really do the research yourself because i don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.280]  claims this just confirms everything else we've already researched
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.000]  rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.120]  millions being killed mandatory quarantines checkpoints
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.400]  everything that's in the other documents but this dovetails with all the other rockefeller
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.960]  foundation documents about the gmo food to sterilize you in the force vaccines and
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.400]  the hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we take
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.560]  our governments back from these eugenics madmen you're not going to be able to go to the ball
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.440]  games anymore you're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.000]  you're not going to be able to just you know go out and enjoy yourself all the time it's scary
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.760]  one thing the nfl really plans to do this year is take as many precautions as possible
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.400]  just to keep everybody safe and that starts with the vast majority of teams deciding already that
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.200]  there will be no fans at all allowed inside the stadium for the games and every single player in
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.800]  the league has been given a smart tag tracking device to help them keep their distance off the
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.040]  field and for contact tracing should it become necessary you're not going to be able to go to
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.680]  the ball games anymore players are not excited about this kind of idea no fans yes but they
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.080]  may have to get used to it but all around the country there will be empty stadiums and masks
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.800]  on the sidelines no fans will be allowed in i can't imagine how he played in the nfl this day
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.080]  and time with no fans there i honestly can't even conceive that you're not going to be able to just
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.920]  go out and get drunk with your friends you're not going to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.040]  all the time don't get the vaccine you can't go to the supermarket don't have the vaccine you
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:38.160]  don't should can't go to the ball game don't have the vaccine can't go to work because everybody
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.000]  in the establishment will still kind of halfway listen now and go he's been right about everything
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.560]  else maybe we should look into this look you'll believe it if they release it so just remember
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.960]  this transmission then the orange county coroner's office is investigating the death of a woman who
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.080]  passed away several days after getting her second moderna vaccine she died after suffering blood
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.080]  clots just over a week after receiving the astrazeneca vaccine her 58 year old mother died
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.320]  less than an hour after receiving the pfizer vaccine my little sister just died her first
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.240]  dose and in orange county an x-ray technician has died after getting his second dose of the pfizer
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.640]  vaccine his dad died four days after getting his second shot of pfizer vaccine i'm not asking what's
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.640]  in the in the infusion i'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the infusion
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:37.440]  i am sticking out my arm and i am taking the infusion you really need to get vaccinated
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.800]  don't resist when they release the bioweapon submit and die with pleasure
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.680]  info wars tomorrow's news today

[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.680]  these folks to people who may not know who they are a lot of folks know who they are your works
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.360]  have been popular for many years i knew jamie i guess before you guys even knew each other back
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.320]  in 2008 she was coming out speaking out against the new world order here in the media in austin
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.440]  but it's great to have you both together i think for the first time i've had you both on the show
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.720]  with me so congratulations on your succession your work obviously we're in a crazy time right now
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.920]  so you guys can take it whoever wants to go first about your journey awakening to the new world order
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.280]  knowing about its plans because a lot of folks are waking up now and that's great but you guys
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.800]  are kind of old school when it comes to the curve here the s curve now going straight up and do you
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.800]  feel vindicated and and then what do you predict is going to come next and then we can just walk
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.480]  through wherever you want to go the history the present the future and just all of the crazy
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:18.080]  systems we're in because the new world order is a world view it's a plan for humanity elon
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.040]  muss has come out now and said he has another plan for humanity well how about we as a society
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:31.600]  through activism through culture through competition decide humanity's direction
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:39.200]  instead of a bunch of globalists manipulating us and and us just being bystanders that just
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:45.760]  sit off to the side so uh jamie and jay great to have you both here why don't you both joey
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.280]  tell folks who you are who may not know who you are and you're awakening and then
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.120]  how long you've been fighting the globalists and now what it's like to not be living in the beta
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.840]  phase of the new world order but i believe living in the operational phase go ahead well thanks for
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.680]  having us it's exciting to be here in austin this is the place that i moved to from california when
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:11.280]  i started to wake up to these things i saw your documentary about bohemian grove and i saw some
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.920]  freeman tv documentaries and i heard that there was a place called brave new books where people
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:23.120]  could meet and discuss these things and maybe make some kind of change so i packed up and i
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:30.960]  moved here and ended up going on austin access and i believe we had the um slot right after yours
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:38.640]  so you would leave the studio and then we would go in and do our thing wow so back then 15 16 17
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.720]  years ago were you questioning whether this was real or not because now it's all out in the open
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:48.320]  i mean what has that process been like jamie well i was raised uh in a fundamental christian
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:54.480]  household so there was always that uh milieu of you know end times and things like that so
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:02.800]  uh my mom actually would go take me to the um bible bookstore and we would rent vhs tapes about
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:09.280]  like fema camps and black helicopters and clinton chronicles so this was something that i was
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:15.920]  groomed to do so you were never woken up you were you were awake from the start i was uh born with
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:24.000]  being fed red pills yeah what is it like now to see it's all out in the open it's a a little
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.960]  frustrating back then it was okay because you know people could mock me they could make fun of me they
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.840]  could disbelieve me or whatever but now there are real consequences you know if you don't listen to
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:39.600]  what i'm saying and you take the vaccine you might die so it's a little disheartening that i'm always
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.880]  right about these things i wish i wasn't but it's dangerous to not listen to what we have to say now
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.760]  after you're done introducing yourself and jay is i want to play a clip from this week we've
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.680]  played it like four times we don't normally play a club four times in one week but elon musk
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:59.920]  beaming in earlier this week to the world government summit in dubai saying i'm not for
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.760]  your authoritarian world government you're going to collapse civilization what an amazing moment
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.160]  we'll get to that in a little while but the last question before we get into all the research you
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.760]  guys done amazing research from the source documents and i love that you mainly you and
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.560]  your husband focus on that what are you predicting is coming next what's your gut level
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:22.000]  analysis but also political analysis of where we're currently at how would you describe the
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.080]  world right now um i think they're going to keep on using what they call future shocks
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.920]  and that comes from that john coleman book the committee of 300 where he says they continually
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:42.000]  uh put out disasters and emergencies to discombobulate people so they don't know
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.160]  what's coming or going and it's not even something that they can have any control over
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:52.880]  so it's a demoralizing technique so i think they're going to roll out more wackier things
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:12:01.520]  maybe asteroids um aliens i agree you know i don't go back and read a lot of books i've already read
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.120]  because there's so many new ones to read but it's funny jay was telling me that you were just
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.560]  rereading over committee 300 i just re-read it about a month and a half ago and it's so prescient
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.040]  people say alex jones is tomorrow's news today no john coleman worked in british intelligence he was
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.760]  in the meetings and i mean you read that book it's literally come true i mean yeah i mean even
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.840]  at the point of the the migration like he talks about the tearing down of the borders he says that
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:29.040]  the us would be destroyed mainly through that europe would have a similar model with islam
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.120]  and so in a lot of these geopolitical writings they talk about that but my awakening was was
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:40.400]  similar to jamie's except i wasn't raised with any kind of conspiracy ideas but around age 18 19
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:45.280]  i started reading about the un i started reading about this kind of push for globalism and i read
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.520]  some john birch stuff back when i was 18 or 19 i think about time i was 21 or 22 i saw your
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.400]  documentaries popped up on the internet saw you covering skull and bones i think in about 2001 or
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:59.680]  2 and i'd never heard of skull and bones so that kind of set me on a rabbit trail uh snowball
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:04.800]  effect where when studied that kind of stuff at a college university studied psychological warfare
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.800]  and what i always wanted to do was tie in because you would reference all these texts when you would
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.840]  do your shows you would say quickly you would say go read brzezinski so i went and found those books
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.560]  you know it's because i was a grad research uh assistant and i just sat and read through all
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:23.440]  those books i had so much time in the library basically just sit and read brzezinski and
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.160]  rockefeller and all these guys and and i remember the first time i called in and it was about 2007
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:34.480]  and i just watched i am legend and i called in and i talked to you and you said oh come back on
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:40.560]  come back on next week and we were talking about how in i am legend it was about this uh vaccine
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:46.720]  bio warfare scenario and we were both discussing how that would probably be the card that they
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.560]  would play and lo and behold i mean i didn't know for sure i was just kind of guessing based
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.640]  on the predictive programming the fiction lo and behold here we are you know they rolled out this
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:01.360]  lockstep scenario of a scandemic where everybody has to essentially give up to automation tracking
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.120]  and tracing vaccine passports all of which was included in that document which was seeded in
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:13.120]  the fiction though a long time ago it's an it's beyond incredible to be living through this and
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:18.640]  and finally i said this earlier the week not to be dramatic i mean i really saw it as a
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.120]  demarcation line in my life i want to hear about you guys personally in your view before we dig
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:28.000]  into the research the material and the reality we're living but i feel like my work and so many
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.800]  people's work before me to expose the globalist agenda to get the new world order out in the open
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.360]  to get their plans out in the open was the first part of winning the war and to get that done
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:42.880]  before they rolled it out operational with their excuses and their pretext and i want to say i
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:48.880]  wouldn't give us an a plus but i'd give us a a minus and i think a c minus would have been
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.560]  worth it people would have had enough awareness that hey the folks doing bad things to you the
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.960]  people destroying civilization have bragged they were planning to do it i think if society had
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:02.800]  woken up to a c minus level we'd probably still win but with a a minus right now i'm not quite
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:07.200]  where i'd want us to be but we're close i don't see how long term they get the agenda through
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.440]  as fast as that s curve is going up of awakening so they're trying to speed their program up they
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.520]  admit they're in trouble even their own documents that leak and i think their program is not going
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:20.320]  too well yeah even brzezinski said years ago before he passed away that there was a danger
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:25.040]  the possibility of mass awakening so we know that from the elite perspective they do have a
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.720]  concern for that that's why they have to put so much time and effort money billions of dollars
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:34.560]  into propaganda continuation of mockingbird style fake media uh and you know one of the great things
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.720]  that trump did was help to collapse the media narrative if if anything that's really what he
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.480]  did was to come in and get people questioning the mainstream media because that was the big
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:48.000]  stranglehold on the minds of most people out there now most people don't believe the media
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.280]  now a single you know 30 second clip on uh twitter from the world economic forum can wake
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:59.280]  millions of people out like that and they've been so uh so heavy-handed with the the transpermia
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.920]  agenda that they're pushing everywhere so over the top that it's really just forcing everybody to
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.440]  wake up but that means that they have to go to something more extreme probably some kind of
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:12.800]  economic collapse i went and read through all of the uh cyber polygon exercise that they did and
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:19.680]  how you know claus was calling for the next thing would be that that uh cyber polygon cyber attack
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.800]  that would that would destroy the economy he said that would be way worse than you thought if you
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.880]  thought covid was bad get ready for that it'll make covid look like a minor interruption right
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:34.400]  yeah yeah well i so jamie and i talk about this all the time we're always discussing like what's
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.880]  the next thing they would roll out and it's got to be probably something they could do another
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.200]  scenario of uh you know the gates is a catastrophic contagion they could do
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:49.440]  uh an economic collapse which is again at some point the fiat bubble has to go away that has to
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:55.200]  pop the debts come due um and that could easily be triggered whenever they want to and they need
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:00.560]  to be positioned as the saviors exactly when that goes down a universal basic income cbdc is that
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:06.960]  giant the big guy from the bis he said uh there's a clip of him uh a couple weeks ago saying that
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.720]  we at the bis are now that's the central bank of central banks we don't know we now we're now
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:17.520]  ready to roll out the cbdc private wallet and if you say anything against the agenda we will shut
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:22.480]  off your wallet that's what he said he said that and and we played it and the eu said it two months
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.120]  ago the bank of england said it the federal reserve said it they're getting ready this is
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:31.920]  what you know there's the guy that guy yeah so this is what you talked about with so many years
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:37.520]  ago you know one of the first things i read was uh about microchips uh it was about how they were
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.600]  gonna have this system what we could call the beast system and i remember you talking about
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.680]  that 20 years ago uh when i when i first heard you and so here we are now but i only knew that
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.360]  because i was reading their own books it's in their books exactly people say oh jones is a
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:58.240]  secret agent how does he know it go read the damn books exactly we were speculating maybe um what
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:08.400]  role ai would play in this and uh we were thinking that in this script maybe ai would be the one to
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:14.400]  stop the nuclear world war three and then that would be the savior that the everyone would have
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:20.560]  to bow to yeah the fourth hour we played the top 10 clips of uh yesterday of world economic forum
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.880]  so we found claus harari all these different speakers we found the top 10 the best that we
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:29.040]  could maybe it was nine i can't remember nine or ten uh and and you know you played i think
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.760]  yesterday too claus saying that the masters of the world will be those that control the ai and
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:40.240]  the metaverse and we must control this or someone else will yeah it's whoever gets that will run
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.080]  things basically so it's the ring of mordor it is ring of mordor absolutely palantir yeah exactly
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:51.520]  well we are commercial free we'll take a few breaks here today but you guys take it over and
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.560]  go where you want to go uh first since i mentioned it here is let's talk about this
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.600]  first and you guys can take over i want your take on this moment because i think we're reaching
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:06.560]  critical mass on on the awakening that these are the bad guys they are in control they want full
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:12.000]  control here is elon musk and i guess that segues into what do you think of elon musk
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.600]  do you trust him or do you think he's an opportunist or do you think he is a rat
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:20.560]  leaving the sinking ship here's elon musk beaming into the world government summit
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.880]  in dubai they have them every year now a couple times a year and he's saying i don't agree with
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:29.360]  your plan because it centralizes things here it is and i know this is called the world government
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:36.240]  summit but i think we should be maybe a little bit concerned about actually becoming too much
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:43.600]  of a single world government if i may say that we want to avoid creating a civilizational risk
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:50.880]  by having um frankly this may sound a little odd too much cooperation between governments
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:57.760]  um you know if you know if you look at say the history and the rise and fall of civilizations
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:03.200]  um that really all throughout history civilizations have risen and fallen but it
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.440]  hasn't meant the doom of humanity as a whole because they've been they've been all these
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:16.000]  separate civilizations that were separated by great distances and so um you know say like while
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:25.520]  rome was falling it you know islam was rising and so you had like a uh you know the sort of
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:31.840]  caliphate doing incredibly well while rome was doing terribly um and that actually ended up
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:38.080]  being a source of preservation of knowledge and uh and many scientific advancements and so
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:45.840]  um so i think we want to be a little bit cautious about uh being too much of a world of a single
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:52.400]  uh civilization because if we are too much of a single civilization then if we if the whole
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:57.520]  the whole thing may collapse um i'm not obviously not suggesting war or anything like that but i
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:03.680]  think we want to be a little bit wary of actually cooperating too much it sounds a little odd but
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:09.360]  um but we just we want to have some amount of civilizational diversity such that if
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.360]  uh if something does go wrong with some part of civilization that the whole thing doesn't
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:20.320]  collapse uh and and you know humanity keeps moving forward well this is a profoundly true
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:26.160]  statement so there's many questions responses to that who is elon musk why is he suddenly saying
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.720]  this now suddenly joe rogan i'm known forever who knew all this stuff when i knew about it
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.280]  he's like oh i'm against the new world order and the enslavement and uh and we gotta stop the wef
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:40.560]  so pop culture joe rogan's pop culture now you know cnn's not mainstream media nobody watches
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:47.680]  it joe rogan's mainstream media it's now everywhere we have become we're still the resistance to the
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:53.680]  globalist above us but they're a tiny elite we really are the majority this is a profound
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:22:00.480]  statement by musk yeah this is so he's aware of you know the global power structure and the fact
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.840]  that there's kind of a struggle to see who's going to control the new world order right i
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:08.240]  think that's kind of what's going on uh i was just reading kissinger's book world order and
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:12.960]  he basically ends the book by saying that what we're looking at now is essentially the rise of
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:17.840]  tech whoever runs the tech he's basically said what what claus said that who controls the tech
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:22.240]  will be the one that controls the the new world order basically and he says there's always been
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.000]  world order the new world order that we're going into according to kissinger according to claus
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.960]  will be run by ai run by the tag it'll be a transhumanist new world order 100 no questions
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.720]  about it and they've all said this publicly as well right all of these books say this it was
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.280]  claus that was recruited right by kissinger it was a part of the harvard project they recruited
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:44.560]  him to be the uh you know frontispiece guy for this new steering committee called davos world
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:49.520]  economic forum but i think back in the 70s uh and that was all set up by rockfellers and kissinger so
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:53.760]  it's all the same people always have the same message and you know this goes back to the ancient
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.920]  world of techne and plato so you know when you're ready to get into that you know we could talk
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:04.240]  about ancient models of governance in terms of empires in terms of the ideal republic and
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.600]  we'll we'll do that we'll go to the roots and right through into the future i think it's fair
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.280]  to call claus schwab the president of the new world order now a lot of people think oh that's
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.600]  like an executive president over our republic no no no in a republic with a real president he's in
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.560]  charge but in a corporation the president goes out and plays golf he speaks to shareholders he is
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:26.400]  the public face and the pr man he doesn't run anything it's the board it's the ceo it's the
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.960]  cfo that's all the people back in the background but but i think it's fair to say claus schwab's
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:35.120]  like the president of the new world order he's the spokesperson yeah the the the frontispiece
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:40.080]  yeah the the face the the voice of the new world order yeah uh the car salesman of the new world
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:45.920]  order um but i think that elon uh you know i get asked all the time as i'm sure you do uh what do
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.720]  you think about trump what do you think about putin what do you think about elon musk you know
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.960]  anytime these people do something good i'm for it that's great um i think that we're all very
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:57.920]  skeptical though when it comes to hero figures so i think we know that we don't expect any single
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.160]  figure to be a hero to save us from anything we know that he has a background in terms of
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.760]  technocracy but at the same time if he does something good if he's if he's if he's pushing
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:11.520]  freedom he's deconstructing like so trump deconstructed media and the lies of fake news
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:16.320]  now elon is deconstructing the lies of big tech through all the twitter files that shows us we
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.760]  know it's not just twitter we know that they're doing the exact same that's right trump made the
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.880]  deep state come out of the shadows now musk is deconstructing it for the silicon valley elite
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.960]  and how that's a control mechanism and it's not just twitter files right obviously the same
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:33.840]  programs are censoring everybody across every one of those platforms youtube facebook it's going to
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:38.320]  be all the same censorship so we know now that that's what they're doing they lied for many many
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.160]  years and said nobody's censoring you nobody's censoring you no of course they are so we can
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:46.560]  thank elon for that um what his motives are i don't know but i'm just happy when we do see good
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.680]  things coming i i see it really is an overton window you've got claus swab and you've all
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.680]  know harari we're going to take over your body you will eat bugs the future is not human and
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:59.440]  then musk is like no we don't need to get rid of the people and we need to move forward but take
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:04.480]  brain chips and you know we need to go ahead and have satellites monitoring and 5g everywhere so i
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:10.560]  see that is kind of the false choices we're given and he's kind of filling the place uh of the
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:15.680]  opposition uh and i think he realizes that being in that place will make him more powerful so i
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:20.560]  don't even believe he's really controlled uh but he's opportunistically in that position and there's
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:27.920]  certain factions of the whole system that actually like having him there as a control on the other
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.000]  side because i don't see all these movements as independent systems generally even though they're
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.040]  independent people running them who actually think they're independent they're seen as steam
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:40.320]  valves or gauges or controls on a massive control panel that's why the globalists have attacked me
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:44.720]  and tried to destroy me to minimize info wars when it got too powerful but then once it gets
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.800]  minimized it's still left there as something they they can get out of the way of it at a certain
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.200]  point and allow us to build opposition to the globalists so i'm not controlled but i'm not
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:26:00.240]  naive enough to understand uh to not understand that they can simply manipulate movements we create
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.840]  only full understanding of how it all works sets us free i think you should see it as a
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:08.240]  big vindication for yourself because like i think you were saying this yesterday here you have one
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:12.800]  of the richest men in the world if not the richest man according to public lists right calling into
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:19.520]  the world government summit saying that we don't need world government i mean isn't that vindication
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:24.080]  isn't that like okay so now we all know it's it's a real thing that you can't hide under a
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:27.520]  rock you can't do this lie and pretend that there's no push that was my next question
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:33.040]  and elaborated than jamie on this is expensive time on this what is it like when the new york
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:37.440]  times just six years ago said i was insane world government doesn't exist new world order doesn't
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:41.440]  exist they were having all these meetings already just not covering it what is it like for everybody
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:46.960]  that denied this existed and then the average liberal is really an establishment minion pushing
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:51.440]  the corporatist agenda how is it for them to now have this all out in the open they just want to
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:57.200]  forget it and move on well it's like you said over to windows so when you talk about it uh it
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:02.880]  doesn't exist you're crazy then uh eventually they haggle over the word so it's not world
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.400]  government it worlds it's world governance those are two different things no it's the same thing
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:11.680]  it's just playing word games like the brits did over world governance then it becomes oh well uh
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:16.160]  there is a world government push and how that's a good thing right that's the twitter journalists
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.560]  speak and then it becomes no anyone who is against us it's time to punish them shut them down
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:25.040]  anybody that didn't want the war government's a bigot so they moved that window gaslighting
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:29.040]  you the whole time and that's why they dressed themselves up in the whole liberal movement they
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:33.840]  fund it's oh we fight nazis though they really fund them in ukraine absolutely and always have
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:38.640]  right going back to world war ii the west funding both communist fascist socialist all of those were
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:43.440]  funded by the big industrialists what is the new world order it's hard i want to and jamie jump in
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:46.720]  here whenever you want about because i watch your show you're an articulate smart lady
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:51.040]  been fighting this for decades what what is your view on why they've come out in the open and where
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:56.720]  this is all going and what is at their heart what is their real ideology uh well let's start with
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:04.080]  elon musk so i did a show on my youtube channel called elon slippery sorcery and i just went back
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:10.480]  to his uh parents and his family and all the things that he's connected to and we did a character
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:18.640]  analysis of this person and what he stands for and it it was kind of bleak i mean we follow
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.480]  symbolism right and occult symbolism and he that's something he's very interested in
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:31.600]  i also did a twin show with that uh about grimes and communism so grimes uh his girlfriend baby mama
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:40.960]  x yeah uh she was um photographed reading carl marks in a public photo shoot and so i think
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:49.600]  that elon is part of the agenda to bring about some kind of socialism communism but under ai
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:55.520]  because that would be more fair but exactly they program it but say oh a computer did it
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:04.560]  keep going um well his mother is a character she is very witchy um you see him coming out in
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:10.080]  jackets that say like what did it uh the devil's champion devil's champion for halloween and then
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:16.720]  he meant to met gala and his back said like norto orvis decorum right so he's aware of these occult
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:22.400]  things um i think like you said he's an opportunist i think he really wants to be popular i think he
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:31.280]  wants to be seen as some kind of savior as a new tesla um a great mind but uh there are also wacky
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:37.440]  reports that come out about his childhood and history that you know you can't really i think
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:42.480]  well when you say witchy i mean people try to act satanic like the grammys and stuff but they're
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.640]  only putting it on you look at every photo of her she's radiating the real deal because i've been
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:51.200]  around that i run into it if you go back to the earlier photo of her smiling like look at my son
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:57.120]  the devil's champion that earlier photo i mean this lady radiates devil power i think you said
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:03.120]  it well you said that the idea is to control uh both sides like he sees himself as somebody who
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:10.080]  might be able to play the good guys and the bad guys and and i can be that you know steering guy
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.440]  of the new world war maybe we can take it in this libertarian direction i think that's a little
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:18.000]  naive though right i mean absolutely but i mean i i've just been around real rich satanist
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.680]  unfortunately ran into him a few times in hollywood and also grew up in dallas and i mean
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:26.720]  it's got to look folks the liberals and trendies try to have the look they don't have it you look
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:33.280]  at his mother she's got it that that's the that's the real deal right there uh yeah she looks like
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:37.360]  she's uh i don't know playing she's a part of nine inch nails or something it looks like she's
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:44.000]  ready to star in the hunger too so people like us that are aware of things they're so hungry
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.720]  for leadership that is also aware and will stand up against it and um i they know that they can
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:55.520]  just drop little bread crumbs like elon says well maybe world government's a bad idea and so we just
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:02.000]  jump oh elon he's a champion it's like the cheese on the mousetrap yeah yeah so they just sprinkle
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.120]  little things that they know that people will eat it up and uh come to their side or maybe start to
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:11.040]  change their mind a little bit um i'm thinking donald trump does the same thing andrew tate does
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:18.480]  the same thing so people with big audiences just say um rational things and then we think
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:25.120]  that they're on our side but i i don't know jimmy what would you call the period we're living in
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:32.640]  right now um there was a book by sarah from rose uh and it's called what was it called it's later
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:38.320]  than you think well he talks about that yeah yeah so an orthodox priest who actually talks about um
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:44.160]  end times and conspiracy theories and all these occult things he uh believes that it's later than
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:48.080]  you think and then our friend just made a show called it's even later than that so i think we're
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:56.880]  very um close to some big event a world changing event well imf just said that i don't know if you
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:01.920]  saw that imf said that get ready for the uh unthinkable to come now that we've had covid
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:06.880]  and perhaps war war in ukraine now get ready for the unthinkable which they don't specify whether
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.120]  that's world war three or and a bunch of them said last week at the world government forum we're
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:16.880]  going to use crises for the full control so what do you think it is because i think covid was a beta
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:21.040]  test for them releasing a real bio weather and that's what i'm really concerned i mean at a gut
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:26.080]  level as a father i want to run to a farm stock up the middle of nowhere not even a nice farm a
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:31.040]  piece of crap behind hills the middle of nowhere 50 miles off of main road i mean if i was a selfish
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:36.080]  person i would be with the woman and the kids and the dogs and me gone uh already at this point
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:42.560]  because my gut level is bio weapon baby really bad real deal yeah ironically that's the when i
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.680]  first called into you in 2006 or 7 that's what we were talking about was i am this i am legend
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:52.400]  scenario and i think yesterday the day before you were talking about uh you know the vincent
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:57.280]  price version the charlton heston version of mega man and you have the will smith version
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:02.880]  and in all those scenarios that's that's seems to be the thing that they they like to run with
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:06.480]  and a lot of these uh global elites have talked about as you know burton russell talked moon
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.680]  raker sorry moon raker we talked about moon raker yesterday right where you have this
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:14.160]  predictive programming of uh depopulating the earth and then reseeding it you know
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:19.680]  that's what hugo drax is up to in moon raker and so yeah i mean that's that's definitely one of
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:24.960]  the cards they could play um and type if if that happened uh you know if we had a bunch of people
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:29.040]  die that would lead to an economic collapse right so you could have both of those at the same time
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:36.000]  a lot of the exercises seem to be more uh bio releases and more cyber polygon economic collapses
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.400]  those are the crisis i agree war is kind of like war yeah sorry go ahead i think war is the
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:45.520]  the little stepchild though i think you're right i think bio weapons number one cyber attacks for
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:50.640]  controls number two and then cultural degradation is kind of the gravy but then war is kind of that
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:55.840]  thing they got their back pocket and they need something to justify masses of populations that
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:01.200]  are left being put into these prison smart cities these lockdown cities where you're safe
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:06.640]  exactly and and take marburg if you infect it they're claiming the u.n says 90 percent
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:10.400]  down it's not really true but they're in headlines saying marburg's out it kills 90 percent of you
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:16.080]  get ready it's already here yeah a catastrophic contagion was what gates was saying uh get ready
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:20.880]  for the next thing it's gonna be way worse we haven't seen anything yet so you know he's been
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:25.840]  signaling for the last two years all throughout covid that that would be the the next play i
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:29.440]  don't know if it's tomorrow or five years ten years i don't know what they're going to do but
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:35.760]  they definitely need to have those uh you know those decade long plan actuary increments 2030
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:41.280]  goals 2040 goals 2050 goals which they even put out publicly they need these catalyzing events
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:46.640]  to get us to those stages i mean look at bill gates the bible talks about strong delusion given
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:51.840]  to those that reject christ i mean how can you not look at his actions because he could look like
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:58.240]  brad pitt a nice friendly guy comes off but do his actions i'd hate him but i mean he just radiates
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:02.640]  creepy evil destructive and then all his actions are that i mean if you have any discernment you
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:08.160]  look at that you know that is a psychotic who do you think is hotter brad pitt or bill gates jamie
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:14.640]  as a female i like nerds so do you like gilberts yeah no what oh come on what i'm saying is red
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.560]  pit comes off it's like the guy next door like it's a nice guy or who else would come off as
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:24.400]  like a guy next to me yeah tom hanks kind of comes off as a guy next door or um oh there's
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.920]  so many people that come off this guy next door
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:28.180]  I
[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:34.620]  Mean you look at this guy. He just radiates evil in my view. Yeah, all these global leads to I mean when you look at Kissinger
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:38.859]  You look at Brzezinski. Look at David Rockefeller. That's another question Schwab is dr. Evil
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.500]  Why is he their spokesperson?
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:47.859]  what they want to do is bring about you know, you've talked about this the externalization of the hierarchy where they can openly worship the
[00:35:47.859 --> 00:35:51.339]  beast and have everybody also worship the beast and
[00:35:51.819 --> 00:35:58.220]  This goes back to what they want to bring about a new Babylon a new Egypt a new golden age of
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.100]  A new satanic age. Yes
[00:36:01.819 --> 00:36:07.180]  You've rid the earth of those that are unworthy the profane and you know the strong go into the future
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:11.339]  Which is actually not really the strong. It's just these sort of really deceivers. Yeah, exactly
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:15.540]  Jamie let's walk that back. You say you like nerds, but you don't like Bill Gates
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:22.299]  No, I mean he's ready to star in the new Lord of the Rings is Gollum no makeup needed. I
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.740]  Just like smart men. I guess I should say
[00:36:26.859 --> 00:36:33.140]  Well with Bill Gates his software wasn't that good. He was just good at getting major funding and screwing over his competitors
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:35.620]  Yeah, and he comes from I think his
[00:36:35.919 --> 00:36:38.700]  Family involved in the deep state for a long time military
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:43.980]  Head of the Planned Parenthood. Yeah, that's his background, you know hardcore eugenicist
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:46.660]  100% open about it for many many years
[00:36:47.299 --> 00:36:51.859]  So, you know, this just represents one of these faces and figures of the establishment. That's
[00:36:52.779 --> 00:36:56.220]  Working very clearly in tandem with all of these other entities including China
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:01.419]  There's a lot of collusion there obviously to set up what they see is the future model
[00:37:01.419 --> 00:37:05.540]  which is the synthesis between Western capitalism Eastern communism, which the
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:10.419]  Chinese communism is that perfect version of a synthesis between East and West from the Cold War
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:16.100]  That's the model they'd like to see for a future global technocratic governance. What do you make of the split?
[00:37:16.779 --> 00:37:22.700]  Between this Anglo-American establishment China. How real is it? I think it's a oligarchical
[00:37:23.899 --> 00:37:28.419]  Grappling like you talked about what the jack for soba yesterday. I would agree with his analysis that you've got
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:32.220]  The OSS to see a they train mouse gorillas
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:38.220]  they set up what we know of as modern China the Royal Society was very instrumental in setting that up moving our
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:44.819]  Industry to to China and then eventually as happens with a lot of the people that the West AIDS and stuff
[00:37:44.819 --> 00:37:51.460]  So there's this period where they tend to want to kind of not do what the biddings of the Anglo-American establishment want and that can
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:56.379]  Either lead to a managed dialectic conflict or I can lead to them being toppled
[00:37:56.379 --> 00:37:57.980]  It could lead to all kinds of different things
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:03.980]  So I see it as like an organized crime figures kind of battling out for again who will control the new world new world order
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:08.060]  It's a turf battle. Yeah. Alright, we're going to go to break with a very important report
[00:38:08.339 --> 00:38:09.339]  by
[00:38:09.339 --> 00:38:14.580]  Greg Reese on predictive programming than a short report on body snatchers
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:17.819]  It's an allegory of what happens the public when they go into this mass illusion
[00:38:17.819 --> 00:38:20.500]  We're gonna come back and I am going to be quiet
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.939]  For as long as you guys want to go we take another break and come back up to that
[00:38:23.939 --> 00:38:26.819]  But I'm gonna come back and give you guys the floor to go start to start at the beginning
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:31.779]  Start the current times the future get a lot of books a lot of documents. You got a bunch of cue cards
[00:38:31.899 --> 00:38:34.420]  so when we come back at least an hour and
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.060]  20 minutes or more
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:42.299]  Of uncensored raw info and folks the enemy has been battling to keep us from getting out
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:47.339]  There's all these ideologies and all these fake systems. We're covering how the world really works
[00:38:47.339 --> 00:38:52.299]  We're going off the true rulers that are almost in total control and now will control your body
[00:38:52.299 --> 00:39:00.020]  And so this isn't some liberal or conservative or some weird populist movement or some side deal most of which they control this is
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:04.399]  Average people analyzing the globalist and saying hey, I can study what you do
[00:39:04.399 --> 00:39:10.500]  I I can now oppose you and so I'm not calling for my own master blueprint for the world like Elon Musk
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:15.040]  Yes, he's challenging the globalist right now in his own turf battle saying he wants his own system
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:21.700]  What if we all have a debate about hey, not what football team we're rooting for which distracts us with that same militant
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:28.000]  Enthusiasm energy tribal energy, but what do we have a discussion about what we want for the future of humanity and our children?
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.520]  We'll be right back. Ladies John with our special guest
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.839]  In the movie knowing the news reported a major oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico
[00:39:48.399 --> 00:39:51.680]  Triggered a fire which burned for three hours before it was extinguished
[00:39:52.319 --> 00:39:58.359]  Officials don't yet know the exact cause of the explosion, but believe a malfunction in the cooling system may have been at fault
[00:40:01.319 --> 00:40:06.319]  The response of the rescue unit the structure was evacuated with no loss of life a
[00:40:06.839 --> 00:40:08.839]  year later the Deepwater Horizon
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.000]  exploded
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:17.200]  Six months before 9-eleven a lone gunman episode showed us the World Trade Center
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.920]  Being targeted by a hijacked passenger plane
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.680]  Liberty in Washington
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:31.799]  Gonna crash the plane into the World Trade Center and last year's film white noise
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:36.520]  Was about a train wreck that poisons a small town in, Ohio
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:56.000]  This is the very same story now playing out in real life
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:03.000]  Within a year of white noises release the actual event occurs in real life in
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.040]  Ohio in Texas and in Michigan
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:13.960]  This is known as predictive programming and its purpose is to psychologically trick the minds of the masses
[00:41:14.279 --> 00:41:19.240]  Into accepting major traumatic events that would otherwise be resisted
[00:41:19.279 --> 00:41:22.680]  In the book Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare
[00:41:23.319 --> 00:41:29.439]  Michael Hoffman describes a mind-control technique known as the revelation of the method
[00:41:29.759 --> 00:41:34.920]  And he writes that when the revelation of the method is performed in a veiled manner
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:42.439]  Accompanied by certain occult signs and symbolic words and elicits no meaningful response of
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:50.520]  Opposition or resistance from the target. It is one of the most efficacious techniques of psychological warfare and mind-rape
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:57.560]  Sarah Elkhalde of the alchemist YouTube channel does an excellent job of explaining all this
[00:41:58.279 --> 00:42:06.279]  According to Elkhalde. There is a law of nature in this universe that compels the dark occult to first gain our consent
[00:42:06.439 --> 00:42:08.439]  Before trespassing against us
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:13.319]  Because they believe this protects them from the natural laws of cause and effect
[00:42:13.799 --> 00:42:17.240]  They offered and we accepted so it's all fair
[00:42:17.799 --> 00:42:23.399]  A lack of response to an action is often taken as an approval of that action
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.359]  And there is an old latin proverb that says
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:32.520]  He who is silent when he ought to have spoken and was able to is taken to agree
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.759]  Silence is considered by many to be a form of consent
[00:42:37.319 --> 00:42:44.299]  And so it is through a veiled performance of the revelation of the method technique that these dark occultists
[00:42:44.839 --> 00:42:46.839]  Believe they are gaining our consent
[00:42:47.399 --> 00:42:53.480]  What we know as predictive programming with predictive programming the minds of the masses
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:57.160]  Are impregnated with visuals of a major event
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:03.000]  Are impregnated with visuals of a major event before it happens
[00:43:03.799 --> 00:43:09.240]  This is done through all forms of media and can be very subtle so that nobody notices
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:15.899]  But the subconscious mind notices everything and can easily be programmed through repetition
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:22.439]  And so these controllers repeat whatever it is that they want us to accept as reality
[00:43:23.399 --> 00:43:26.540]  Because these images are delivered to us through entertainment
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:33.319]  They elicit no meaningful response of opposition or resistance and so we accept them
[00:43:34.259 --> 00:43:35.560]  subconsciously
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:43.480]  And when the event happens in real life, it is already familiar and acceptable to us as if that's just the way it is
[00:43:44.439 --> 00:43:49.799]  It's a mind trick and it works by keeping everyone locked in a spectator state
[00:43:50.359 --> 00:43:53.899]  This causes what is known as paradigm blindness
[00:43:54.279 --> 00:44:00.839]  Which is when a person is incapable of seeing any reality other than what they've already been exposed to by the media
[00:44:01.319 --> 00:44:08.759]  This paradigm blindness will cause a person to get emotionally triggered whenever confronted with an alternative point of view
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.479]  That they have not been programmed to accept
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:16.040]  It's a very powerful mind trick and the solution is quite simple
[00:44:16.439 --> 00:44:21.000]  We need to stop living as spectators of someone else's reality
[00:44:21.399 --> 00:44:26.839]  We need to start creating our own reality and we need to remember how to say no
[00:44:27.319 --> 00:44:34.200]  Because they offer it to us and we accept it. This program contains language and sequences
[00:44:34.279 --> 00:44:36.279]  Some viewers may find disturbing
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:44.359]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread and the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum
[00:44:44.839 --> 00:44:46.839]  We're beholden to scum
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.240]  Please listen
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.240]  If you don't if you won't
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.880]  If you fail to understand
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:06.759]  And the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you the function of all life
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.560]  is survival
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.720]  Sleep
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:13.720]  Sleep
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.720]  Sleep
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.720]  The seed is planted
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.720]  Terror grows
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.939]  All of a sudden they're growing like parasites is it contagious
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:03.720]  It looked right at me you need to get out you're looking at it as if it was human it was not human
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:09.000]  Now the classic fear begins to grow
[00:46:09.399 --> 00:46:15.799]  We're being cornered in a modern masterpiece of science fiction barricading the street
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:19.620]  Invasion of the body
[00:46:39.799 --> 00:46:47.899]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance it's alex jones
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.120]  And jamie handshaw jade dire
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.479]  And now we're going to get into their presentation on the new world order the system what it's doing
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:03.799]  But since we aired that little report from friday that important report by greg reese on prediction programming
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:08.040]  People will watch the few examples you use and say oh, that's just people covering things
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.120]  That are probably gonna happen anyways, and of course it is but
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.560]  Chris carter
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:18.279]  Later told me and told others that he was approached by the cia for that lone gunman episode
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:24.600]  For this element the cia hijacks a jumbo jet to fly the world trade center and blame it on afghanistan to launch a new war
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:30.200]  And there's so many examples. So we know this does indeed go on not all examples are what's happening
[00:47:30.279 --> 00:47:34.839]  Everybody's seen it for themselves. You guys want to comment on predictive programming and then
[00:47:35.399 --> 00:47:37.720]  Where do you want to get started here now that we've set the table?
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:44.520]  Well, we have taken our show on the road and now we do a live show and in that show
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.600]  I give a talk called the all-seeing ai
[00:47:47.479 --> 00:47:50.040]  And when you said you wanted the history of the new world order
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:54.859]  I said this is exactly what he's looking for because um, my talk begins in ancient mesopotamia
[00:47:55.799 --> 00:48:02.279]  And the first cities that we know of it's a pagan overview of history. So it's very bleak. It's very gross and barbaric
[00:48:02.839 --> 00:48:04.120]  but um
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:07.880]  The first cities babble on a cat or rook those things were actually cults
[00:48:08.439 --> 00:48:12.439]  To the ancient gods and they believed that the gods resided in the city
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.140]  And the priest class served the gods and the people served the priest class. So it is a very stratified
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:19.880]  culture
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:21.080]  um
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.680]  and one of the
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:28.839]  Most interesting goddesses of this time was inana and she was a gender-bending goddess
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:31.560]  so she
[00:48:32.439 --> 00:48:34.439]  Was worshiped by cross-dressing
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:41.560]  By ritual public sex, which was the uh legitimacy of the kingship that ruled over these cities
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:49.240]  They would have festivals called akitu festivals where they would uh, the king would copulate with the goddess in public and
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.560]  They would worship in this way and the tales of these gods and goddesses
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:54.920]  were
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:59.319]  Uh interesting because they weren't benevolent. They weren't all knowing they weren't all loving
[00:48:59.799 --> 00:49:05.319]  They were warlike the only thing they had was advanced technology and uh,
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:11.479]  Eternal life basically and then this goes into plato if you want to mention that
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:17.000]  Well, please continue with your I mean I want to hear what he has to say, but this is interesting, okay
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.880]  um, so
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:22.920]  Let's see talking about inana and babelon. So
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:27.640]  Sumer also was one of these cities. So inana was a
[00:49:28.339 --> 00:49:31.960]  Promethean character in that the stories say that she brought down
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:33.799]  the
[00:49:33.799 --> 00:49:36.759]  aspects of civilization that make an empire thrones
[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:39.540]  priesthoods fire
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:45.560]  And then you have gilgamesh who was like the first celebrity
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:50.439]  He was a two-thirds god and his preoccupation was with eternal life
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.799]  He the tales of him was that he would
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:50:00.040]  Require all the virgins to sleep with him on their wedding night. So they appealed to the gods and uh,
[00:50:01.399 --> 00:50:03.399]  They created this um
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:08.920]  Bigfoot beast man for gilgamesh to wrestle with called ankidu. So he would leave them alone
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:14.759]  So these are just the heroes of antiquity that became like our superman tales of today
[00:50:15.399 --> 00:50:17.399]  right
[00:50:17.479 --> 00:50:18.600]  Uh
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.759]  inana ishtar
[00:50:20.759 --> 00:50:24.439]  Is associated with lions so that's where you get the lions on the gates of babelon
[00:50:24.439 --> 00:50:27.160]  That's where you get a lion's gate of hollywood
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:33.240]  That's a studio that is responsible for movies like saw and hunger games. So when you see that lion's gate logo
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:35.640]  You know, you're in for a trauma
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:41.720]  Uh, she's like like I said a luciferian promethean character because she brought fire to the city
[00:50:43.319 --> 00:50:45.720]  And um, let's see what else
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:51:16.000]  So these are controlled structures and mechanisms right like this is these are structures for how to control empires through ideologies and through secret societies, which is what Plato talks about. Yes. And this is why transgender and gender bending is so important today because this is what she represented in the ancient times. It says she had the power to change men into women and women into men. Nothing new under the sun. It's the same kind of degeneracy that's part of the enslavement of the masses
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:46.000]  And whether you believe in God the devil, any of that or aliens came out and did this. This is being repeated in cultures totally separated from each other. And they're all obsessed with living forever. And they're all obsessed. But then Noah along comes to the old Judaic idea says no to this. God's mad. We've been mixing the seed. Yeah. That mixing of the hybridization idea, which is like species shouldn't be blended. You shouldn't have you have these biological limitations. And all of this is about breaking down those boundaries.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:52:16.000]  Well, there's no doubt they're bringing back the ancient. It's like Ghostbusters. A cult builds a building as a psychic temple to bring in these energies. That real building is in San Antonio. Oh, really? Yeah. It'll show it to you. Yeah. Huh? Yeah. Well, that's built like a lightning rod to attract right spiritual forces. Right. Well, and also Freemasonry plays into this heavily. But I was going to say the Babylon that Al Shorcolly is trying to usher in as a complement to his A.I. series. I'm not going to go into that.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:46.000]  But Freemasonry, the God of Horus, which is the God of War and sex and death, is an amalgam of Ishtar and Kali from the Indian pantheon and the Scarlet Woman from the Book of Revelations. So he kind of mixed all these up. And this is the character that you see all the pop stars will be playing like Rihanna at the Super Bowl. She's a Scarlet Woman. Katy Perry did this. She rode the back of a lion at her Super Bowl performance.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:53:16.000]  Just like Al Shorcolly's tarot card that represents Scarlet Woman. It's the dark goddess. We see this figure popping up in fiction all the time, especially in new movies, Marvel movies, this dark goddess entity. And that's an inversion of the male principle. Right. The Church of England just said, we're going to get rid of God, the father. It's time to go either gender neutral or it's actually time to through feminism and radical feminism, promote the notion of the goddess, which is the overthrowing of the masculine phallocentric logo theology, which which they see as their enemy. And they sell that through programming.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:26.000]  There's a lot of progressive groups saying we once worshipped the goddess. All our problems are worshipping the male. But really, this is going back to something far darker where it's not male or female. It's alien.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:40.000]  Yeah, the idea in a lot of these cults and secret societies and ancient hermetic groups is that you need to transcend the limitations of both male and female. And there's this higher sort of neoplatonic monad entity that is beyond all distinctions.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:50.000]  And a lot of the cult societies, a lot of satanic groups also have the same neoplatonic philosophy. And so the amalgamation of everybody into a giant blob, getting rid of all the distinctions.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:54:00.000]  I was actually said in perennial philosophy that all distinctions and boundaries have to be broken down to create a giant blob of humanity, a giant blob religion for the new world order.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:11.000]  And that erasing of all the boundaries. And that means nation states. That means families. All boundaries have to be washed away for what Crowley called the equalization of all things. Everything has to be equalized.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000]  I was about to say, though, that's only a bridge to where they want to go, though.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:26.000]  Right. But that's something for the profane. Right. For the elite power class, priest class, priests of science, priests of power. For them, they don't they're not subject to any of this. Right. That's only for for the masses.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:39.000]  His dictum was the slaves shall serve. So he advocated a very stratified aristocracy that knew the occult, that knew these things, that knew who they served, which were the demons. And then they occulted that from the public who served the aristocracy.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:51.000]  And that's what the British Empire, which utilized Freemasonry as its essentially its intelligence network. They found Crowley so fascinating and interesting and useful because they had the same basic philosophy. Right. That social Darwinism.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:58.000]  Well, wasn't he really just externalizing what they were already doing? Yeah, he was. He was not a cloth swab. It was a mouth. He was. He was a foul face.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:06.000]  He was utilized by my five in doing actually World War One propaganda.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:18.000]  He did a little pamphlet tearing for British intelligence in World War One, and then they recruited him in to be a kind of a side guy under Dennis Wheatley and Maxwell Knight to get Goebbels to fly into Scotland.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:24.000]  So they actually utilized because a lot of the Nazi high command believed in some of this esoteric stuff.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:32.000]  They actually used Crowley to get him to fly into Scotland. It was all a big ruse. Rudolph has. Excuse me, has, yeah.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:46.000]  So that that is how they utilize this network, this secret society ideology. But again, that goes back to Plato because Plato says that in order to have the ideal republic, which is a communistic republic, to run it efficiently,
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:51.000]  he says you have to have the secret society, which utilizes the noble lie, which lies to everybody.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:57.000]  He says the ultimate purpose of this is to, number one, control society, but also to keep the population in balance.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:04.000]  You have to have a perfect number, which is in equilibrium with nature so that you have too many people, but the system runs because you have too few people.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.000]  And Malthus said that, too. Exactly. Yeah, they're pulling directly from Plato.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:13.000]  Right. But Russell says an impact of science on society says that if you're looking at all this plan, you understand what we're doing.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000]  Very end of the book, he says it is a global version of Plato's Republic.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:24.000]  So the origin of theater, of drama, of play acting comes from the worship of these gods and goddesses.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:33.000]  And the actors thought that the gods would actually possess them and they would act out scenes of the other world.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:39.000]  So it's voodoo. Exactly. That's exactly how. By the way, put that back on screen. That's an allegory of Plato's cave.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000]  It's a projector on a wall. It's Hollywood. Yes.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:49.000]  And the founder of the Church of Satan, Anton LaVey, called the self transformative psychodrama.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:56.000]  So if you act like something, you will become it. If you want to be a vampire, then you need to only go out at night, avoid garlic, drink blood,
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.000]  do all the things that a vampire would do, and eventually you will be one.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:04.000]  And you can see that these people a lot of times are overtaken by a spirit.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:12.000]  Even Beyonce said that when she goes on to perform, she feels something take over her body and she doesn't really remember. Lady Gaga.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:18.000]  Yes. And they're able to do things that they wouldn't normally be able to do.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.000]  Yeah, dissociation, artists that can dissociate or have these.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000]  So basically, they're telling us some of the avatar that these things are jacking in.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.000]  We have any idea from your research who they are, what interdimensional.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.000]  Yeah, I think there's reality of demonic entities. I think that demons really do exist.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:40.000]  I think that we can tap into those powers which ultimately want to destroy humanity.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:46.000]  You know, if you look at the accounts, for example, people that do DMT, they do LSD, I've had bad trip.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:51.000]  You know, I saw something. It was definitely not my mind. It was actually an entity.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000]  So this is very common in those kinds of experiences.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000]  Tell us about your bad trip.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000]  I was in high school and I didn't realize how strong the acid was.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:06.000]  And so by the time we got to the movie theater after dropping acid, I remember it was grumpier old men.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:13.000]  And all I recall was Martin Landau face melting. The theater was breathing.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.000]  And I blacked out for a few hours. That's all I know. So it was a nightmare.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:23.000]  But I did experience, I saw some dot of light. I don't know what that was, but I don't.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.000]  I know it was a conscious entity. It wasn't my mind and it did communicate.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.000]  But I came out of that and I realized like this is no joke. Like this is a serious thing.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000]  I wasn't even spiritual or into anything, you know.
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:38.000]  Well, I've had experiences without hallucinogens where the entities, particularly when you're young,
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:46.000]  that's why they target people around puberty. I was like 10, 11 was really happening where it says this is going to happen and then it happens.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.000]  That's where everybody knows the spiritual is real. It just means the unseen.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.000]  Well, drugs play a huge part in these mystery calls.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:00.000]  Like I'm thinking of the cult of Pan where they would give you drugs and then you would act out scenes of Pan
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.000]  and go meet a virgin in the woods and copy like that.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:10.000]  I'm also thinking of Freemasonry where the initiation is a theatrical performance.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:17.000]  So in the third degree, you are supposed to be Grandmaster Hiram Abiff who was killed by three ruffians.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:23.000]  And in this play that is not open to the public, you know, they kill you.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:28.000]  They bury you with a bunch of furniture and then they come and raise you again with the grip of the lion's paw
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:34.000]  and they take your blindfold off and you see the star and now you've seen the light and you're raised in Freemasonry.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:39.000]  So when we ask why is Hollywood so occult, it's a continuation of that secret mystery school.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000]  Exactly.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000]  Keep going, sorry.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000]  Let's see.
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:53.000]  So yeah, every pagan nation had its state religion for the public and then its private stories for the initiated ones
[00:59:53.000 --> 01:00:00.000]  or the illuminated ones who only knew, had contact with the gods or had possession of the gods.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:07.000]  And so it was two things for those who know what's going on and those who don't, the illumined and the non-illumined.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  And of course, there's more rings within it. There's not just two rings.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  Yeah, and the idea here is that you can do this on a global scale eventually, right, to run world religions.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  We're seeing this right now with world religions where they're being co-opted into this larger ecumenist movement to create a new global religion.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  I think that a big part of capturing the Vatican was to bring it into this situation where now, I don't know if you guys know,
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  but they're building an Abrahamic faith center where it's like Judaism, Islam and Christianity now are this new third religion they're calling Chrislam, right?
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  There's a giant Abu Dhabi faith center that the Vatican has built where now all the world religions are moving into this new position, this new thing.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  But that's exactly what Aldous Huxley and even H.G. Wells wrote a whole book that Jamie called my attention to.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  I'd never seen it.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  It's called God the Invisible King.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  And in that book, H.G. Wells, who you might think was an atheist being that he was a high-level Marxist, British, empire, communist guy, Fabian socialist.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  No, he says, I do believe in an entity. It's called Lucifer.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  And Lucifer is not the same thing as the Bible. It's this enlightening entity that will bring about a new age, a new aeon.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  So actually, H.G. Wells was writing about the new age in the late 1800s, early 1900s,
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  years before the Esalen Institute in the 60s countercultural promoted the new age.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  He was writing about atomic bombs in 1900.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  And genetic modification.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  Alana Dr. Moreau, he's talking about alien technology, all this kind of stuff that would lead to the NWO way ahead of its time because he knew that they were planning this stuff.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  He wrote about babies in test tubes.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  He wrote about plasticity of the human brain and that you could genetically modify humans to be other types of creatures way before anybody had actually done genetic modification.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  So, yeah, he was the Bernays before Bernays, basically.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  So how's their timeline going?
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  Well, we're smack dab in the middle of it.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  So the history of Mesopotamia and then I would say the present is Hollywood and the future is AI.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  And that's why I called the talk all seeing AI.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  But also they flashed a picture of Al Shirkoli doing this symbol and that's called a symbol of pan.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  And pan is the god of all.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  So this kind of dovetails into the religion, the god of all the ecumenism that we're talking about is going to be pan worship.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  Yeah.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  And the only thing is you can have everything, but you can't say you love Jesus.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  You can't say you love God.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  You can do whatever you want.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  Pedophilia, be a Christian, whatever.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  But sign on to this.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  Yeah, in the 18 in the 1890s, the British Royal Society elites had concocted that plan, which was to reorganize the world according to a resurgent British empire.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  And they had speculated on different types of religions that could be the model.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  They talked about maybe using Islam.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  That was a big part of why the British Empire wanted to control Mecca.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  They talked about using a new kind of religion that they would just create wholesale, which is a kind of mesmerism melded with New Age.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  Or they talked about Christian science as a possible contender for the new world religion.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  But then it looks like what they decided on was this kind of Madame Blavatsky, Alice Bailey, sort of U.N.-funded, theosophy-based religion, which influenced most of the world religions.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  And Hitler followed that in the U.N. as a chapel in New York.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  Exactly.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  And so this is the official U.N. philosophy, the loosest trust that used to be the loose for publishing.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  And it turns out that a lot of the Bolsheviks, a lot of the Soviets were also into theosophy.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  So theosophy is kind of this mastermind world religion movement that's behind the 60s counterculture, the New Age.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  It's behind a lot of the satanic cults and sects.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  It's behind anything you could think of in terms of new religious movements and cults.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  You can go back to Blavatsky.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  And in my view, she was just British intelligence.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  She was directly connected to all of these Royal Society elites, the Milner Group, the Fabians, Lord Curtis.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  All these guys were sort of in the circles and using a lot of these theosophists to be as a go-between even with the Bolsheviks.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  It's pretty wild.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  But that's how they were having these connections between who was supposedly the enemy of the British Empire, the Communists.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  How did the Nazis fit into that?
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  Well, they were doing the exact same thing because the Nazis, the British had a policy of appeasement.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  They had a dual policy.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  So on the one hand, they had a public policy of opposing Hitler for many years.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  But then secretly, they were also having compacts with him because they wanted him to do that quickly.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  So it's quickly says they wanted him to go in, invade, go into Poland, go into these countries and start World War II because that was the position that the Royal Society wanted.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  And they had a secret treaty within which it's admitted.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  We're not saying Hitler's good, but the globalists set him up.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  They wanted him to do the war.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  And quickly says that the reason that the elite wanted Hitler to do that is the same reason that they established and set up World War I through that false flag of Archduke Franz Ferdinand being assassinated through that secret society group, which the Black Hand, which also had connections to British intelligence and the Royal Society elites.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  They did that because they wanted to, in the 20th century, exhaust and destroy their main two competitors, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Catholicism and the Russian Empire and Orthodoxy.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  So that's the two world wars and the Cold War.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  The purpose of that was exhausting those competitors.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  Then the Anglo-American establishment would have a preeminence in the 20th century.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  That was the whole plan, according to Quigley.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  A lot of people don't realize that the rainbow flag is actually the flag of theosophy and the tearing down of Christianity and traditional moral values and replacing it with what they call the hidden rays of the ascended masters.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:57.000]  Yeah, Alice Bailey has in one of her books a ten-point plan to destroy Western civilization and Christianity and replace it with this new Aon.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:03.000]  So what we consistently see in these people is a strategy of infiltration, subversion, institutional capture.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  It's a key way that not just communists, who I think a lot of people know that communists utilize institutional capture, but it was also a strategy of the people above the communists to turn these institutions to globalist ends.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000]  And that's a big part of what's going on.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  You don't want somebody to be a communist to say, hey, you're for gay marriage, right?
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000]  You don't have gay people.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  Oh, sure.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  Now you support this flag that supports open borders, pedophilia, communism, surveillance, total control, backed by big corporations.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  And now you're worshiping big corporations, you're supporting surveillance, you're supporting pedophilia, you're supporting global government, all because you love gay people.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  It has nothing to do with that.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  It's all just a wedge issue to get control.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  You're following a flag, the ideology of the corporations, but you think you're woke and a liberal.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  It's crazy.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  You always say this, right?
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:07:01.000]  If Hitler had worn a pink sweater, if he had just had a liberal face, that's so much more successful, that's so much more powerful in terms of psyops.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  You think about the people at Google that you talk about or the people at Silicon Valley that are just laying around wearing hipster outfits.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  That's all psyops to get you to think that this is a fun, you know, laid back tech situation that's coming about.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  No, no, actually, it's a hard core psychological warfare operation run by the most devious.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  And I had a conversation yesterday with a guy at a bar who he has friends and family member that work in big pharma.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  And he was saying that they were talking about how much they hate the public and how happy they were to f over all the public in the last three years.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  So you have to understand that these are people that have absolute disgust and disdain for humanity because they already thanks to the Internet of the last 30 years.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  They already have psychological profiles on them all that are classified.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  They hire them because they're not just sociopaths, they are sadistic psychopaths.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  And that you have to have that demonic sort of attitude in you.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000]  You have to be participating in that demonic energy.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  I think they want people to willfully compact, too.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  They want the reason they do the predictive programing in part is, I think, to get people to buy their own will, buy into it, co-opt into it, compact with it.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  Because I think from an energetic perspective, that makes this all the more powerful.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  Well, they turn their will over to it. Go back to the guy you were talking to and it comes out in the news.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  You see in the documents the disdain for a farmer, the disdain for a family because they actually are envious of that at a subconscious spiritual level.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  They've sold out to evil and they're just mad at a happy family on a farm.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  Yeah. And so they want to destroy it. They have this impetus, this inexplicable desire and furor to this predatory animus, predatory.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  And you see this in a lot of revolutions that break out, French Revolution, communist revolution, socialist revolutions.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  This this is madness, this fervor that overtakes people.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  We see it in these people that do the protests at the college is the exact same spirit.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  Why are all these purple haired people eater people at the universities acting so demonically, just howling and foaming at the mouth?
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  You've seen some of these people when you go out and protest, they just start foaming at the mouth because they're obviously.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  Well, we haven't seen some. You go to any Democrat event, it's like you're in a lunatic asylum.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  I mean, it's the same spirit that you see in, you know, when you look at Lenin, you're seeing those pictures of Lenin when he's in his.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  He's at the old folks home that the insane asylum and he's sitting in his and they said to roll him out at night and he would howl at the moon.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  Yeah, yeah. In 2012, we were walking down the street and we just so happened to be walking past the visor headquarters and we peeked inside and there's a giant beautiful mosaic.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  But it had all these symbols on it, magic symbols that had, I think, alchemical symbols.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  And we were trying to take pictures of it and people came out and they told us to move on.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  You can't do this. But this is pharma key is the root word for sorcery.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  Yeah. And this goes back to when I was reading the Committee of 300 by John Coleman.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  He does a really good job of detailing that the trade routes and everything that were established in the 19th century and 18th century were all about drug running.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  Opium, heroin and getting people of British Isles and Western Europe hooked on these exotic drugs.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  And the Chinese to control them. Exactly. Yeah. Since since they were able to pull up V.I. Lenin there in his wheelchair, totally demonically insane.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  If you see that famous movie directed by and also starred by Clint Eastwood.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  I forget the name of it. It's got Jeff Bridges in it.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  I forget the name, but there's a scene where a guy's on the side of the highway and he just opens up the front of his car and puts out a bunch of white rabbits and starts shooting them with shotguns.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  And Clint Eastwood punches him out. Well, that's I was later reading.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  Thunderbolt Lightfoot is based on Lenin had this little island at his farm where he would just go out there all day and just bite and kill and stab and shoot little white rabbits.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  Not for dinner, not to go out and hunt, but just for the pleasure.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  But you raised that point, guys, you tried to get me to play it two weeks ago.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  Usually I do. And in a couple of days you went, hey, you should really show the new transgender spokesperson in New Zealand because he looks completely demonic.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  And has that trillion mile stare like V.I. Lenin.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  There it is. Look at this person here. Let's go and play the audio of this.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  Go and roll the audio.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  And learning about the perspectives and priorities and communities and countries in our region and globally, promoting gender equality is the right thing to do.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  But it's also the smart thing to do. It is central to Australia's diplomatic, economic development and regional security, as well as our international engagement.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  I look forward to working with partners in Australia, in the Pacific, in Southeast Asia and globally to progress the Australian government's priorities to increase women's economic.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  That's Australian, not New Zealand. Sorry, I was confusing him with Arden.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  Yeah, I mean, it's hard not to see some degree of something else driving that meat sack.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  I mean, more and more they show government ministers like the health ministers in the U.K. did a three minute press conference, three minute video release, never blinked.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  And people are like, what is this? What is that?
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  I think it's it's demonic. And a lot of these people are on all who knows what kind of pharmaceuticals are taken.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  Right. I think the pharmaceuticals facilitate the possession, facilitate aid.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  Like you said, the Bible says that pharmacare don't do pharmacare because it allows the demonic.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  Yeah. And I've been reading this excellent book on Gladio, which is a good insight into how the New World Order allied itself with organized crime and with the intention to co-opt religion, especially in this case, the Vatican.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  That was a kind of the goal here for this deep state intelligence network was to utilize these devout.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  And it's tied into drug warfare, drug pharmacare like you're talking about.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  That's a form of warfare, a form of siege. Right.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  So you have to understand that it's not this nation against another nation. Right.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  I mean, you can see a microcosm of that with fentanyl and what's going on in America and who's behind that kind of stuff.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  But on a global scale, just think about what would the big pharmaceutical corporations be doing, working with the New World Order?
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  They're they're targeting the entire population with drug warfare.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  What are mRNA therapies but a form of sorcery and drug warfare?
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  That's all right. Let's do this. Let's go to break and come back and get into all that.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  The time we have left. This is amazing. I love being commercial free by commercial free.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  I'm not playing commercials, but we are literally supported this amazing place.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  These great guests is all your funding and support at info war store dot com.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  Got great products you need. Want to thank you all for your support.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  I would suggest you will see more of this in the future with your support right now.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  Please don't take it for granted. I know. I know. I know most of you don't.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  But some of you might not be conscious about it. Please take action now.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  Info war store dot com. We're going to air a couple of special reports.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  We're going to come back and you guys are going to continue on with all these books you've got to cover and so much more.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  Now, now, Jamie, how do people find your work?
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  I know you have a popular podcast. You also co-host with Jay, but you're being a little bit humble here.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  How do people find all your work?
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  My channel is you can find it on YouTube under my name, Jamie Hanshaw, and the show is called out of this world.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  And I have two books for sale on Jay's analysis called Weird Stuff Operation Culture Creation.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  And those were published in 2012 and 2011, but they still have a lot of really good, detailed, historic information about what we're talking about right now.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  A lot of times it's like the endgame is better because now you've seen it happen.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  Yeah. Now we live in the endgame.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  And I had a part three that I was working on and then I got I've, you know, started doing something else.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  But it was all about androgyny. And this was in 2010 that I started writing about hermaphrodites and androgyny because what I saw Lady Gaga doing.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  And we'll talk about why that's so important.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  We're not against a man that was dressed as a woman. We're not attacking those individuals.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  Like, oh, why are people against drag queen time? No, we're not against drag queens.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  I mean, some going after children will explain why they want that.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  It's the bridge into transhumanism and the future.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  You guys go wherever you want. We come back.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  But I'm going to spend at least 10 minutes with what the future would look like if the globalist were successful.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  Jay's analysis dot com.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  Jadar is our guest, along with his amazing wife.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  X head of respiratory research at Pfizer, Mike Yeadon, and researchers, including Craig Pardecuper, have sourced VAERS data on vaccine death and injury in the U.S.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  A database of over 700000 adverse reactions caused by the Moderna, Pfizer and Janssen vaccines.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  These vaccines have been deployed in different batches, officially referred to as lots.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  This has allowed Yeadon's team to back engineer Big Pharma's COVID-19 vaccine deployment agenda in the U.S.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  All their information is published at HowBadIsMyBatch.com and HowBad.info.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  And what we learn is quite telling.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  About 0.5 percent of all the different batches are highly toxic, resulting in hospitalization, disability and death within days or weeks of injection.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  Other batches cause minimal adverse reactions and most appear to be harmless placebos.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  When plotting on a timeline, we can see that these three companies have been working together to quietly monitor the lethal effectiveness of specific deadly
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  batches. While one company is deploying a lethal batch, the other two deploy harmless ones, creating the scientific environment to perform dose range
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  finding or the maximum tolerated dose for each specific batch.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:30.000]  The timeline shows that each lethal batch deployment is preceded and followed by a quiet period, allowing them time to establish their baseline before the
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  next deadly batch is deployed. Private leaked documents from the CDC show a list of expiry dates and only certain lots are included.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:46.000]  The very same lots found to be highly toxic in part of Cooper's database, which makes sense.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  There would be no reason to list expiration dates for saline placebo, only the deadly ones.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  This mode of deployment allows governments the ability to direct deadly batches into specific populations such as red states.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:12.000]  Analysis of the number of dying per 100000 vaccinated in 50 states shows us that the overwhelming majority of vaccine deaths are happening in red
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  states. Some red states are experiencing 11 times more vaccine deaths than other states.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  On average, red states are experiencing twice the amount of vaccine death and injuries than blue states.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  After ruling out other possibilities, part of Cooper concluded that this can only be due to the fact that red states received at least twice as much of the
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  lethal batches than blue states did. Among several other crimes, they are tipping the scales of the democratic process by killing people who
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  voted against the New World Order's woke build back better great reset, while at the same time endlessly flooding the borders with
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  unvaccinated foreigners. And it's happening right now. Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  If the world's a stage, then is it farfetched to say that many people simply look the part?
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:31.000]  Imagine that a newscaster loses his job and say opens a daycare business. Would you sign your kid up if the owner looked like this?
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:37.000]  If asked why you said no and you did say no, you might say it was something about his face.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  Since we form this opinion about someone in less than 100 milliseconds of seeing them, what data goes into that decision?
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  Are these judgment calls influenced beyond someone's beauty and attractiveness?
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  As it turns out, humans have been reading each other's faces for thousands of years. This practice is called physiognomy.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:02.000]  Physiognomy dates back to ancient Greece and China as a way to predict one's outcomes in life.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:09.000]  In the Middle Ages and beyond, physiognomy became a diagnostic tool used by scholars and early criminologists.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:16.000]  Modern practitioners like Christian Chua maintain that face reading is a valid and useful science.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:25.000]  He states that someone's face is a direct result of their gene expression or epigenetics and can display revealing clues about someone's inner world.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  This means that what you learn, what people tell you, your environment affects the expression of your genes.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.000]  And your genes express it and manifest it on your facial structure.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:47.000]  I know some people say, oh, you should not be so judgmental. Oh, you should not discriminate. Science call it profiling.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  I like this guy. Skeptics may dismiss Chua's analysis as unscientific.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  But what if we harnessed the impartial power of artificial intelligence to do the face reading for us?
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  A study conducted by Stanford professor Dr. Michal Kaczynski used machine learning to scan thousands of faces in order to predict political orientation, left or right.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  The results of the study were shocking. Once trained on a large enough data set of faces,
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  the AI was able to predict whether someone was right or left politically with up to 73% accuracy.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  Humans attempting the same task performed only slightly better than chance with a score of 55% accuracy.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  In a companion study, the author noted that liberals were more likely to face the camera directly,
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:38.000]  less likely to express disgust and were more likely to express surprise.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:49.000]  Another machine learning study conducted by the same Dr. Kaczynski also found that AI was able to predict whether or not someone was homosexual based on their face alone.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  Given a single facial image, a classifier could correctly distinguish between gay and heterosexual men in 81% of cases and in 74% of cases for women.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  Humans once again performed poorly compared to the machine with scores of 61% accuracy for men and 54% for women.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  Leftist media naturally lost their minds at this and made articles attempting to poke holes in Dr. Kaczynski's study.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  What's that? Making judgments based on outward characteristics? Who would ever do such a thing?
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  So is artificial intelligence proving that our story is written on our face? For now, it appears that the answer is yes.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:38.000]  But we must remember that human interaction is a nuanced, context-heavy phenomenon that is full of exceptions.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  Someone with an inviting facial presentation may have horrible intentions within. Someone with a harsh, uninviting facial presentation may have good intentions within.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:55.000]  Our gut intuition, however, can bridge these gaps of uncertainty and make accurate assessments of someone for us.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  Unfortunately, globalists have been deploying a wicked arsenal of toxins and psyops designed to dampen this powerful, God-given compass we all possess.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  Our gut feelings help us discern between good and evil. Building the muscle of saying no to those who serve evil, no matter what they look like, is a critical spiritual exercise for all during these accelerated times.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  Gavin De Becker, security expert and author of The Gift of Fear, calls on us to remember something very important about the word no.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:35.000]  No is a word that must never be negotiated, because the person who chooses not to hear it is trying to control you.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:45.000]  So if your gut is screaming that something is off about the unemployed newscaster at your doorstep pitching you his daycare service, what are you going to say?
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:58.000]  Oh my God. I mean, that is a horror movie cover. Seriously, he is scarier looking than hit the clown. I mean, would you let your children anywhere near that psychopath? I mean, look at him. God.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  For InfoWars.com, this is the psyop cop.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  Great job, the psyop cop. That's on Banned Out Video. We'll post it on the front page of InfoWars.com. This is some of the great reports they've been hiding from me.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  All right. Jamie Hanshaw, co-host with the great Jay Dyer. I'm telling you guys, take over. You're doing great. It's a great broadcast.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  Let me get into all your knowledge. You want to talk about Hollywood Babylon, and then Jay's going to segue in.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  Well, the two have always been associated even since the creation of the movie camera itself with the Nickelodeons on the East Coast.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  So these were little things where you could put your nickel in and you could see a lady dancing or something like that.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  And they became the first rudimentary public pornography machines. And on the East Coast, they didn't really want these things around.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  And another thing was the cameras needed a lot of natural sunlight to get the shots that they wanted.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  So they had to move the entire enterprise from New Jersey to California. And this was the Wild West of Hollywood.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  And this is what the movie Babylon with Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie is about.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  Yeah, show some B-roll of that. Funny, I was just watching that last night. Go ahead.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  So they didn't really have any restrictions or ratings or restraints on these first movies.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  And they were very scandalous to the people of the 20s and 30s, and this started the Roaring 20s, which they thought led to the Great Depression.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  And they associated Hollywood with Babylon, and this is why they had to get people like Walt Disney to be a new face of Hollywood
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  and, you know, moral values.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  If you go to the Hollywood Highland Center in downtown Los Angeles, you will see some Anunnaki.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  It is called the Babylonian Courtyard, and it is leftover scenes from the 1916 movie D.W. Griffith's Intolerance.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  And it's a giant Babylonian archway. There you go. There's Nusku on the right, and it looks like Enki holding a pot of water.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  And then the squiggly thing in between them is the Mesopotamian Tree of Life.
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:24.820]  So it's a giant occult complex.
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:25.820]  Exactly.
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:32.259]  And you think about Kenneth Anger, the famous Crowley, who did Loose for Rising with Mick
[01:26:32.259 --> 01:26:36.980]  Jagger and all those characters connected to Bobby Basile and the Manson family.
[01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:41.900]  Anger did a famous book called Hollywood Babylon, making this connection between how Hollywood
[01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:46.460]  really represents an ideological or a theatrical version of Babylon.
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:48.179]  And that's exactly what Jamie's talking about.
[01:26:48.179 --> 01:26:53.940]  That's what that new movie, which was actually a big flop in terms of economics, that movie
[01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:54.940]  is very insightful.
[01:26:54.940 --> 01:27:00.460]  I actually thought it was pretty accurate in its portrayal of different phases of the
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:04.019]  eras of Hollywood, like Jamie's talking about, pre-Hays Code.
[01:27:04.019 --> 01:27:08.580]  Hays Code was brought in after that 1910s period when the movies were really, really
[01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:09.580]  semi-pornographic.
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:13.219]  And they brought in the Hays Code, which was the Catholic Church promoted.
[01:27:13.219 --> 01:27:15.540]  Then that went away, I think, in the 50s and 60s.
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:19.980]  And everything got even crazier via the counter-cultural revolution.
[01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:21.940]  But Hollywood has always been this kind of Babylon.
[01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:26.860]  The weird thing about that movie is that it actually portrays it as a semi-satanic thing.
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:31.380]  By the time you get to the Tobey Maguire character, I won't spoil the movie, but by the time you
[01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:36.340]  get to that part, he's actually showing you what's the underbelly of what's really going
[01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:37.340]  on in Hollywood.
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:41.099]  He takes them down into a dungeon, and they're down there eating the heads off of rats and
[01:27:41.099 --> 01:27:42.099]  engaging in orgies.
[01:27:42.099 --> 01:27:44.639]  I mean, it's like it gets crazier and crazier.
[01:27:44.639 --> 01:27:48.679]  And then you have basically the dissolution of Hollywood because that last remaining character
[01:27:48.679 --> 01:27:50.200]  isn't destroyed.
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:54.000]  All the main characters end up destroyed except for Manny, the director.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.759]  The guy who ends up being a director, he leaves Hollywood, and he goes and has a family.
[01:27:58.759 --> 01:28:00.240]  He actually survives.
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:01.440]  He's the only one that survives.
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:05.960]  And then he realizes at the end, spoiler alert, when he gets to the end of the film, he goes
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:11.840]  and watches movies, and he has this sort of out-of-body, almost hallucinogenic experience.
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:13.440]  I think that's what we're supposed to think.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:17.880]  And he understands that Hollywood is basically a giant deception.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:23.280]  The art form itself is great, but Hollywood, it was basically there to destroy and degrade
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:24.759]  American culture.
[01:28:24.759 --> 01:28:26.160]  Now the elite are done with Hollywood.
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:27.160]  They've basically given it up.
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:29.559]  Now it's moving to the internet, the metaverse.
[01:28:29.559 --> 01:28:30.559]  That's the future.
[01:28:30.559 --> 01:28:31.559]  They don't care about Hollywood anymore.
[01:28:31.559 --> 01:28:32.559]  That was my next question.
[01:28:32.559 --> 01:28:34.160]  I see this as a tombstone on Hollywood.
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:37.719]  They're even telling you, and at Barry Diller, they're all saying, we're over.
[01:28:37.719 --> 01:28:38.719]  We're dead.
[01:28:38.719 --> 01:28:39.719]  Yeah.
[01:28:39.719 --> 01:28:44.840]  I was talking to Jamie Kennedy from Scream, and he's a really cool guy, friends, I think,
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:48.280]  with Eddie Bravo and Sam Tripoli and all those guys.
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:52.719]  And he was saying, you know, Hollywood, in Hollywood, it's not what it was anymore.
[01:28:52.719 --> 01:28:54.200]  It's pretty much, it's done.
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:55.200]  It's over.
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:29:00.559]  And it served its purpose to basically weaponize and destroy American life and culture.
[01:29:00.559 --> 01:29:02.440]  Now they can move on into the metaverse.
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:03.440]  That's the next phase.
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:09.040]  One of the interesting things about the movie Babylon is how they depict the cheapness of
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:12.040]  human life compared to the shot.
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:18.759]  So there's two scenes where people perish in the scene, and they just kind of, you know-
[01:29:18.759 --> 01:29:21.160]  There's a bunch of people dying in the big battle scene, for real.
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:22.160]  Yeah.
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:23.160]  Exactly.
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:24.160]  They're telling you the shot is king.
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:25.160]  There's human sacrifice.
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:26.160]  Exactly.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.160]  Yeah.
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:28.160]  Keep going.
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.160]  I'm sorry.
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:30.160]  That's okay.
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:31.160]  So-
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:32.160]  I just watched it last night.
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:33.160]  It was-
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:35.240]  Everybody knows that there are a lot of Jewish people in Hollywood.
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:41.200]  But actually the first five major studios, 20th Century Fox, MGM, Warner Brothers, Universal,
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:44.799]  and those were all also Masons.
[01:29:44.799 --> 01:29:51.240]  And the Masons say that they get a lot of their rituals from the Dionysian artificers.
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:54.660]  It's hard to say, but it was the cult of Dionysus.
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:59.259]  So Dionysus was constantly pushing the boundaries of taboo.
[01:29:59.259 --> 01:30:05.240]  They use drugs, music, dance, and trance-inducing techniques to return the individual and initiate
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:08.460]  into an animalistic-like state.
[01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:09.460]  So-
[01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:10.460]  And that's what they've done to the whole culture.
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:11.460]  Yes.
[01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:12.460]  Degrade us into being animals.
[01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:14.780]  So it's a giant ritual to make us animals they can control.
[01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:15.780]  Exactly.
[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:16.780]  Yeah.
[01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:18.620]  And he was known as the god who comes.
[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:23.059]  He was the god of fertility, wine, grapes, hallucinations, madness, and orgies.
[01:30:23.059 --> 01:30:28.660]  And he became Bacchus in his later incarnation, yes.
[01:30:29.059 --> 01:30:31.059]  And Pan was also part of Dionysus' entourage.
[01:30:31.059 --> 01:30:33.059]  Yeah, Pan is Bacchus.
[01:30:33.059 --> 01:30:34.059]  Mm-hmm.
[01:30:34.059 --> 01:30:35.059]  Keep going.
[01:30:35.059 --> 01:30:39.860]  So Hollywood is proud of its celebrity membership.
[01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:45.340]  If you go to the Masonic Temple in New York City, there is a special lodge room for actors
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:51.620]  because they need special schedules to accommodate their shooting and their busy schedules.
[01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:57.580]  The Academy Awards used to be held in the Scottish Rite Shrine Auditorium.
[01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:02.580]  And the Hollywood Masonic Temple is now Disney's El Capitan Theater and home to used to be
[01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:03.580]  Jimmy Kimmel.
[01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:04.580]  I'm not sure what it is now, but-
[01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:07.500]  And now we know Jeffrey Epstein documents are coming out.
[01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:09.940]  They use Disney movies as code for children.
[01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:11.259]  I just saw that yesterday.
[01:31:11.259 --> 01:31:18.460]  So they could order a Snow White or they could, you know, I want Belle next time.
[01:31:18.460 --> 01:31:21.299]  I do a whole series on Disney.
[01:31:21.299 --> 01:31:25.299]  So if you ever want to do specifically just Disney, I can do that too.
[01:31:25.299 --> 01:31:27.299]  Well, talk some about Disney.
[01:31:27.299 --> 01:31:31.900]  Walt Disney was an enigmatic character.
[01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:37.940]  I just did a three hour podcast a couple of weeks ago and we went into the psychology
[01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:38.940]  of Disney.
[01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:46.340]  So he's an interesting character in itself, but he was co-opted the day after Pearl Harbor.
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:50.940]  All the tanks and trucks rolled into his studio at Burbank and they commandeered his studio
[01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:52.900]  to make propaganda films.
[01:31:52.900 --> 01:31:57.580]  So a lot of people don't know that the reason that we pay federal income tax is because
[01:31:57.580 --> 01:31:59.740]  Donald ducked it at first.
[01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:04.099]  Because a lot of people back then knew that it was unconstitutional, they didn't want
[01:32:04.099 --> 01:32:05.099]  to do it.
[01:32:05.099 --> 01:32:08.139]  So they had to release these cartoons where Donald's paying his taxes, Minnie Mouse is
[01:32:08.139 --> 01:32:16.219]  saving her bacon grease to make arms for taxes to beat the axis was their slogan.
[01:32:16.219 --> 01:32:21.500]  If you want to learn all about Walt Disney in wartime, there is a good DVD series called
[01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:22.700]  Walt Disney on the Frontlines.
[01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:24.179]  And this is produced by Disney himself.
[01:32:24.179 --> 01:32:30.940]  They're very proud that he was so instrumental in the wartime effort.
[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:33.860]  It's a giant military industrial complex mind control operation.
[01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:39.219]  And it reminded me of there was a satire film that came out in 2011 called escape from tomorrow.
[01:32:39.219 --> 01:32:43.000]  And supposedly the story around this movie was that they snuck into Disney and filmed
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.340]  it with Disney unaware.
[01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:47.780]  I find that a little hard to believe given the fact that there's biometrics and cameras
[01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:49.780]  everywhere at Disneyland.
[01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:53.980]  But what's weird about this such a satirical movie is that is independent film.
[01:32:53.980 --> 01:33:03.420]  In the film, they have people come to Disney, and they order Disney princesses for an evening.
[01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:10.179]  So there's also a child in the movie who wanders off and comes back and has been it's a boy
[01:33:10.179 --> 01:33:14.620]  and they've dressed that he's been dressed up as a princess as a girl in this movie in
[01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:18.780]  2011 telling us these things again, well, that's how you really dominate men in the
[01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:19.780]  male forces.
[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:20.780]  Yeah.
[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:21.780]  They're not really turned into a woman.
[01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:22.780]  They're turned into something.
[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:23.780]  They aren't.
[01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:24.780]  Yeah.
[01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:25.780]  They're destroyed.
[01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:26.780]  It's a lie.
[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:27.780]  So they're getting into accept an inversion.
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:28.780]  It's the same as the war on women.
[01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:29.780]  Yeah.
[01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:30.780]  Yeah.
[01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:36.019]  Well, most people don't realize every ride in Disney is sponsored by a giant corporation,
[01:33:36.019 --> 01:33:37.900]  usually military industrial corporations.
[01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:42.620]  So if you go to Epcot Center, you pay with your credit card and then you have to give
[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:43.620]  them your thumbprint.
[01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:46.019]  They have biometrics everywhere.
[01:33:46.019 --> 01:33:48.620]  You go into that giant Epcot Bucky ball.
[01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:51.219]  By the way, it came out 10 years ago.
[01:33:51.219 --> 01:33:53.860]  You pull this up, folks, you just search engine.
[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:58.259]  Disney was working with the Pentagon and using its models as a model of a reeducation camp
[01:33:58.259 --> 01:34:01.740]  or a camp during a war or a plague.
[01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:04.340]  So Disney is wargaming, put us in your camps.
[01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:09.420]  Well, Epcot stands for experimental prototype civilization of tomorrow or community of tomorrow.
[01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:14.360]  And if you go in that big ball, it is sponsored by Siemens, which was a Nazi corporation who
[01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:17.280]  had their exact same logo over the gates of Auschwitz.
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:18.639]  You want this is in Orlando.
[01:34:18.639 --> 01:34:21.120]  So what they're saying is.
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:23.759]  When Klaus Schwab said a few years ago, they put signs up at the U.N.
[01:34:23.759 --> 01:34:28.639]  I shot video of it saying you will not live in cities, you will live in communes.
[01:34:28.639 --> 01:34:29.639]  This is it.
[01:34:29.639 --> 01:34:32.160]  Yeah, that's actually the experimental city of tomorrow.
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:38.240]  Tomorrowland Epcot are supposed to be 15 minute A.I. smart cities way ahead of time.
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:40.679]  And it was prepping us all for the monorails.
[01:34:40.679 --> 01:34:41.679]  Wow.
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:49.480]  Disneyland was built in partnership with S.R.I., which is a big mind control center
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:52.040]  for research and for Research Institute.
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:57.920]  And what they did was study lay lines and occult things to put the park exactly on where
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:04.240]  these places intersect so they would have more of more esoteric power in the location.
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:07.000]  A.C.I. is who got that land for a while.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  Wow.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  There it is.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  Disney is the 15 minute city model.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  Yeah.
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:15.480]  So S.R.I. and Disneyland and then the CIA helped build Disney World.
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:16.480]  Right.
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:21.559]  So the same people who were staging things in Cuba and, you know, different operations.
[01:35:21.559 --> 01:35:22.559]  MKUltra.
[01:35:22.559 --> 01:35:23.559]  Yeah.
[01:35:23.559 --> 01:35:30.799]  But they knew how to come in and do it in secret so that they wouldn't be under scrutiny
[01:35:30.799 --> 01:35:31.799]  by the law.
[01:35:31.799 --> 01:35:32.799]  So they have.
[01:35:32.799 --> 01:35:33.799]  So it's all predictive programming.
[01:35:33.799 --> 01:35:34.799]  Yeah.
[01:35:34.799 --> 01:35:36.799]  What do you make of a Santa saying he wants to take over Disney World?
[01:35:36.799 --> 01:35:38.799]  Because it's promoting pedophilia.
[01:35:38.799 --> 01:35:39.799]  Yeah, please.
[01:35:40.599 --> 01:35:45.840]  I mean, this is a total war on our culture, on our humanity, on our civilization.
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.160]  It's total warfare.
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:48.160]  How is the cult?
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:49.160]  You guys are incredible.
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:50.160]  Keep going.
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:51.160]  I'm not going to ask questions.
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:52.160]  Keep going.
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:53.160]  You're bringing up so many right in this in this.
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:54.160]  So this is a dark satire.
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:56.719]  I think there is a lot of predictive programming and escape from tomorrow.
[01:35:56.719 --> 01:35:58.559]  I just remembered it.
[01:35:58.559 --> 01:36:03.440]  The dad who kind of, you know, unknowingly takes his family to Disney, Disney in the
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:06.440]  film actually kind of represents a macrocosm of America.
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:07.440]  Right.
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:13.240]  And if I recall, there's some kind of like a virus that's loose while he's in Disney
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:14.719]  and people are getting sick.
[01:36:14.719 --> 01:36:17.679]  He wanders off and gets lost in Disney World.
[01:36:17.679 --> 01:36:18.679]  He loses.
[01:36:18.679 --> 01:36:19.760]  His kid wanders off, too.
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:26.080]  And he ends up waking up underneath Epcot in a giant mind control tank where he's being
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:29.920]  he's being programmed like something out of the Ludovico method of Clockwork Orange.
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:30.920]  Right.
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:32.639]  I'm not saying they literally are taking people underneath.
[01:36:32.639 --> 01:36:33.639]  Maybe they are.
[01:36:33.639 --> 01:36:34.639]  I don't know.
[01:36:34.639 --> 01:36:35.639]  But it's a revelation of the method.
[01:36:35.639 --> 01:36:36.639]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:37.840]  Yeah.
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:45.920]  So the dad ends up underneath the Epcot ball in a giant Ludovico method, you know, chair
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:50.120]  being programmed through the mass media, through Disney.
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:53.879]  And so it's symbolic of what they're actually doing to the entire population.
[01:36:53.879 --> 01:36:54.879]  That's you know, it's funny.
[01:36:54.879 --> 01:36:56.280]  Talk about escape from tomorrow.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:37:02.120]  The last words because it was on his notepad written by Walt Disney were Kurt Russell.
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:04.920]  Of course, he's escaped from New York and all the rest of it.
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:05.920]  Well, he was a Disney kid.
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:07.200]  He was a Disney kid.
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:08.200]  Yeah.
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:12.240]  And if you follow the careers of all these Disney kids, Miley Cyrus, Britney Spears,
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:20.080]  Lindsay Lohan, et cetera, they all have very serious breakdowns later on in life because
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:21.080]  of what they experienced.
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:23.000]  And then I have no people that know Russell.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  I mean, I know.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:29.920]  Jeff Bridges, I've talked to him and Jeff Bridges, he's awake, but I'm told people that
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:32.760]  know him that he won't ever got a hold of him every time on the show.
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:33.760]  But Kurt Russell's awake.
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:36.120]  So some of them get out of it, it looks like.
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:37.120]  What are you going to say about that breakdown?
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:40.280]  Well, I was just going to say about Small World.
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:43.360]  So it's a Small World is sponsored by UNESCO.
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:45.920]  And if you go to the front page of UNESCO, I did a couple of months.
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:48.240]  It was all about the vaccinations.
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:52.000]  And it said no child left behind or something like that.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:57.719]  And it just to me, it had a sinister double meaning, like no, no people left after the
[01:37:57.719 --> 01:37:58.719]  Oh, exactly.
[01:37:58.719 --> 01:37:59.719]  So let me ask you this.
[01:37:59.719 --> 01:38:00.719]  You guys are bringing up amazing points.
[01:38:00.719 --> 01:38:02.480]  I asked this earlier, I want your answer.
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:03.960]  How is it going for the New World Order?
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:04.960]  Are they behind?
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:05.960]  Are they on schedule?
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:06.960]  Are they ahead of schedule?
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:13.519]  I would say they're on schedule for certain things and behind and other things.
[01:38:13.519 --> 01:38:17.519]  I think that's why they rolled out what this big catalyzing event in the last three years,
[01:38:17.519 --> 01:38:22.920]  this KOOF, and then this live exercise with the engineered pandemic.
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:28.400]  That was a big catalyzing event to bring about which locks up talks about automation, right?
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:33.360]  Everybody overlooks the fact that automation was what they really wanted to roll out right
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:34.360]  now.
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:37.679]  That's why we're seeing AI is being released, because that's going to be part of this automation.
[01:38:37.679 --> 01:38:40.320]  It's meant to lock us in our houses to make us obsolete.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:41.320]  Yep.
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:45.080]  So that was all successful for the next phase of this business plan.
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:48.200]  But the rollout of the World ID, the Capital Society.
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:52.120]  That's this 10 years by 2030, 2040, right, 2030.
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:56.840]  They had what, eight goals listed that we covered in the fourth hour yesterday.
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:03.719]  Those eight goals were things like destroy Western civilizations, ideas of economic progress,
[01:39:03.719 --> 01:39:04.719]  American supremacy.
[01:39:04.719 --> 01:39:05.719]  That has to go away.
[01:39:05.719 --> 01:39:07.679]  Nation, states, and borders go away.
[01:39:07.679 --> 01:39:08.679]  You will not be eating meat.
[01:39:08.679 --> 01:39:10.200]  That's the thing they have to get rid of.
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:11.500]  That's a huge element.
[01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:13.000]  They're attacking the food right now.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.940]  I mean, that's vegan- Because bee production holds up most of small
[01:39:15.940 --> 01:39:16.940]  towns.
[01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:17.940]  Exactly.
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:18.940]  Yeah.
[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:20.360]  It's a war on middle America, the South.
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:21.360]  Independence.
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:22.360]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:25.740]  And that's why they're also doing this in the Netherlands, right, with the farmers protesting
[01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:26.740]  up there.
[01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:29.219]  They're trying to ban farming, which you've covered many times.
[01:39:29.219 --> 01:39:31.580]  That's all part- While there's a world food collapse, they're
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:32.580]  trying to ban farming.
[01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:33.580]  Yeah.
[01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:35.519]  Canada makes them dump millions of gallons of milk a week.
[01:39:35.519 --> 01:39:42.879]  This is all organized as part of this movement into this austerity, post-industrial civilization
[01:39:42.879 --> 01:39:46.019]  where the elite will have that technocratic control.
[01:39:46.019 --> 01:39:49.620]  Everybody else will be on the dole of the universal basic income, the CBDC.
[01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:50.620]  That's all got to roll.
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:54.540]  In my view, I think that they would need, like we said earlier, some kind of big catalyzing
[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:56.580]  event, which the IMF says is the unthinkable.
[01:39:56.580 --> 01:39:57.580]  You're ready for the unthinkable.
[01:39:57.580 --> 01:39:59.299]  It's the next card to play.
[01:39:59.299 --> 01:40:02.940]  And these are psychos that have done it before, so we should take that seriously.
[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:05.660]  I mean, these are the people that rolled out the last three years.
[01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:06.660]  So yeah, right?
[01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:08.340]  I mean, what were the last three years?
[01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:09.340]  Pretty crappy.
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:11.040]  I mean, so okay, what's the unthinkable?
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:16.540]  We went to Epcot once for research, and we went on this, do you remember that boat ride?
[01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:21.379]  And it was sponsored by Chiquita Banana, but it was all about hydroponic food-
[01:40:21.379 --> 01:40:22.379]  Well, it was GMO.
[01:40:22.379 --> 01:40:25.860]  Yes, GMO- The purpose of the ride was that GMOs are
[01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:27.900]  going to save humanity because we're going to feed everybody.
[01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:30.299]  Well, of course, that's not what GMOs are there to do.
[01:40:30.299 --> 01:40:33.940]  It's to change the genome, just like the mRNA shots are to change everybody's genome, right?
[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:38.179]  So every ride is just a commercial, basically, for what they want to roll out in the future.
[01:40:38.179 --> 01:40:39.820]  So here's my question.
[01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:44.440]  It looks like people overall, though, are rejecting it and now recognizing propaganda.
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:46.820]  So propaganda only works if you're not aware of it.
[01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:48.099]  What happens as humanity awakens?
[01:40:48.099 --> 01:40:50.980]  It seems like that's happening.
[01:40:51.019 --> 01:40:57.740]  You'll have to form communities and structures and networks outside of this structure, outside
[01:40:57.740 --> 01:40:58.740]  of this system.
[01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:00.940]  So this system will continue to kind of collapse.
[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:06.860]  Just think about, and I don't mean to be rude or cruel, but if you adopt an ideology of
[01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:12.500]  changing your gender, getting rid of your reproductive organs, that's a sterilization
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:14.059]  act.
[01:41:14.059 --> 01:41:16.299]  And that means that you won't go into the future.
[01:41:16.299 --> 01:41:20.379]  So the people that opt into this system, it's sort of like a dark, there's a dark logic
[01:41:20.379 --> 01:41:25.820]  to it that you also ensure that your progeny, your descendants don't go into the future.
[01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:33.420]  So if we have communities that are pro-life that continue to operate off of this system,
[01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:38.340]  we have God, gold, guns, Bitcoin, these kinds of things, those are the solutions.
[01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:39.340]  That's right.
[01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:46.540]  It needs us to hate ourselves, give up on our life force, and roll over and die.
[01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:53.420]  So you mentioned automation and the founder of the Church of Satan, Anton LaVey, actually
[01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:58.960]  admired Walt Disney for his work on animatronics because he believed, well, he had a dream
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:03.540]  and a vision that would be bigger and more valuable, he thought, than Ford Motors.
[01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:12.099]  And this was automated creation of synthetic humanoids, you know, androids, sex bots, robots.
[01:42:12.139 --> 01:42:20.139]  I met with a big globalist about two years ago, off record, and I said, what is the future?
[01:42:20.139 --> 01:42:24.059]  And they said, synthetic humans for sex, because sex is everything.
[01:42:24.059 --> 01:42:29.019]  And once we can legalize human clones that aren't really human but are corporately created,
[01:42:29.019 --> 01:42:30.460]  it's all over.
[01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:35.019]  So that's really legalizing slavery, because it is a human, but it's not fully human.
[01:42:35.019 --> 01:42:39.379]  The corporation says it's not human, and now we all buy into this sex slavery, oh, I've
[01:42:39.379 --> 01:42:43.340]  got this person that cleans my house, does all this work, is pre-programmed, or has sex
[01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:44.340]  with me.
[01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:45.340]  That is so evil, man.
[01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:48.340]  Yeah, and they've been, you know, AMC had a show called Humans.
[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:53.660]  That was the plot of that show, was when they roll out the house bots, right, which would
[01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:55.580]  be these sort of synthetic I Am Robots.
[01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:58.780]  And the argument is, it's a clone of you, so hey, I own this person.
[01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:04.580]  So you've made yourself a slave, and now you've got yourself pre-programmed as a slave.
[01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:08.660]  You're literally being corrupted and making someone a slave, but you say, it's my right,
[01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:10.740]  it's me, but you made yourself a slave.
[01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:11.740]  Think of that.
[01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:12.740]  That is so alien.
[01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:13.740]  That is so advanced.
[01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:14.740]  That is so evil.
[01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:17.980]  And that's what Levee talked about, that he said that he knew that the satanic Aeon would
[01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:23.139]  be here when we had the home companions and the sex bots, because that would mean that
[01:43:23.139 --> 01:43:25.580]  it's the end of humanity as we knew it, right?
[01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:31.219]  And so that's a social Darwinian and evolutionary view that the humanity as it has been has
[01:43:31.219 --> 01:43:32.219]  to go away.
[01:43:32.219 --> 01:43:33.219]  Their plan's not gonna work.
[01:43:33.219 --> 01:43:38.139]  Well, right, but that's the thing is that, like, this is so unnatural and so bizarre.
[01:43:38.139 --> 01:43:41.019]  I think humans are fundamentally structured that they-
[01:43:41.019 --> 01:43:45.580]  Well, there's also a interdimensional spiritual buildup of all our ancestors that already
[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:50.900]  affected, like, rocks of the pond, the universe, that even don't believe in God, which God's
[01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:53.379]  real, but we are literally energetic creatures.
[01:43:53.379 --> 01:43:56.019]  That will of the species is not gonna be so easily defeated.
[01:43:56.019 --> 01:43:59.860]  They may wipe out the first wave of us or the second wave, but it's like spraying poison
[01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:00.860]  on bugs.
[01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:01.860]  They become immune.
[01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:07.139]  Well, you were talking about genetic memories and that there's a process that you go through
[01:44:07.139 --> 01:44:08.940]  as a human being, especially as a man.
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:13.059]  You're supposed to hit puberty and then go through these normal male rituals, where,
[01:44:13.059 --> 01:44:17.099]  for example, when I was in high school, it was like a John Hughes movie, there was cliques,
[01:44:17.099 --> 01:44:24.019]  and you tried to become part of a clique to dress up and flirt with women, to go and get
[01:44:24.019 --> 01:44:25.019]  a date, right?
[01:44:25.019 --> 01:44:26.019]  That's a natural ritual.
[01:44:26.019 --> 01:44:27.019]  And there were women that were in each clique.
[01:44:27.019 --> 01:44:28.019]  Exactly.
[01:44:28.019 --> 01:44:29.019]  Not added women of all the cliques.
[01:44:29.019 --> 01:44:31.099]  All the cliques, right.
[01:44:31.099 --> 01:44:37.660]  So if you can keep people from going through those normal rituals that you go through as
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:40.580]  a coming of age process, then people stay in that-
[01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:41.580]  They never get empowered.
[01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:43.260]  They never get empowered, exactly.
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:49.460]  They never activate those genetic memories, racial memories that you talked about.
[01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:52.099]  And we don't have, then they don't go into the future.
[01:44:52.099 --> 01:44:54.860]  And so the sex bots will be a big part of how they shut that down.
[01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:57.379]  Your bot is going to be your warden.
[01:44:57.379 --> 01:45:00.540]  So they're gonna be connected to the internet of things.
[01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:06.059]  If you think your wife is annoying and nagging now, just wait until your sex bot wife turns
[01:45:06.059 --> 01:45:07.059]  off all of your-
[01:45:07.059 --> 01:45:08.059]  Klaus will shut it off.
[01:45:08.059 --> 01:45:11.099]  If you think a phone's spying on you, imagine when you're having sex with her.
[01:45:11.099 --> 01:45:12.099]  Yeah.
[01:45:12.099 --> 01:45:17.400]  Or she'll say, you haven't accrued enough intimacy points because you said something
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:18.460]  bigoted to Tay.
[01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:19.460]  So you know-
[01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:23.460]  Yeah, Klaus shuts off your picture in the dog house for a week.
[01:45:23.460 --> 01:45:28.139]  I've had a lot of these off record meetings, people say, why don't you say who it is?
[01:45:28.139 --> 01:45:29.780]  Well, then I don't get those meetings.
[01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:30.780]  I don't agree with them.
[01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:31.780]  I tell them they're wrong.
[01:45:31.780 --> 01:45:36.139]  But I've been at the big billionaire's houses, all the different, I mean, a lot.
[01:45:36.139 --> 01:45:39.900]  And they don't do it as much anymore because I just never, never, never sell out.
[01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:46.019]  But they said the sex, the replicants are the answer.
[01:45:46.019 --> 01:45:47.019]  Same thing.
[01:45:47.019 --> 01:45:48.019]  I didn't know Angela if they said that.
[01:45:48.019 --> 01:45:49.019]  Yeah.
[01:45:49.019 --> 01:45:50.019]  So is how much, I don't know.
[01:45:50.019 --> 01:45:51.019]  Where did he write that?
[01:45:51.019 --> 01:45:52.019]  I haven't-
[01:45:52.019 --> 01:45:53.019]  Well, he has a book where he talks about-
[01:45:53.019 --> 01:45:54.019]  His biography?
[01:45:54.019 --> 01:45:55.019]  Yeah, his biography.
[01:45:55.260 --> 01:45:59.900]  And then also, Atatli says in Brief History of the Future, he wrote that in 2006, he says
[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:06.139]  that by 2040, the companion bot will basically be tailored to you.
[01:46:06.139 --> 01:46:10.820]  So think about chat GPT, which they're rolling out right now, imagine something that's tailored
[01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:11.820]  to you, right?
[01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:15.660]  Then it knows everything about you, your profile, your likes, your dislikes, but not on your
[01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:19.900]  phone, but actually in some sort of, you know, Android that's sort of walking around.
[01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:20.900]  That's what-
[01:46:20.900 --> 01:46:22.900]  And I was reading, I heard about those.
[01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:24.019]  People think it's a perfect servant.
[01:46:24.019 --> 01:46:25.460]  No, it knows how to mess with you.
[01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:26.580]  It's going to manipulate you.
[01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:27.580]  He says that.
[01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:28.580]  Oh my God.
[01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:30.620]  That's in Blade Runner second.
[01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:31.620]  Yes.
[01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:34.620]  In the 2049 Blade Runner, yeah, exactly.
[01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:38.420]  Ryan Gosling has an iOS that's his essentially girlfriend.
[01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:42.059]  And he finally gets upgraded where she's becoming more real.
[01:46:42.059 --> 01:46:48.780]  And the reveal is that she's sent by the New World Order Corporation to manipulate him
[01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:50.900]  so that he won't figure out what's really going on.
[01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:53.019]  And they use all of his likes, his-
[01:46:53.019 --> 01:46:56.059]  Now when he starts breaking free, oh, you've been upgraded.
[01:46:56.059 --> 01:46:57.540]  She's not just at your house on this chip.
[01:46:57.540 --> 01:46:59.379]  She now can go anywhere with you.
[01:46:59.379 --> 01:47:00.379]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:00.379 --> 01:47:03.860]  Whereas they could actually download into a new Simplicit synthetic body.
[01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:05.420]  He could actually have a woman that was that.
[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:06.420]  Yeah.
[01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:13.179]  And they have that weird scene where he melds, he hires a prostitute to meld with the iOS.
[01:47:13.179 --> 01:47:17.500]  That movie, Spike Jones is really important too that he did called Her with Joaquin Phoenix
[01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:25.260]  playing near dystopian, near future where they're beginning to roll out the personal
[01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:29.179]  companion bot iOS and he marries his iOS.
[01:47:29.179 --> 01:47:30.620]  They have this marriage ceremony.
[01:47:30.620 --> 01:47:32.940]  This is so uncool.
[01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:34.620]  Like why would you do this to people?
[01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:37.379]  It's just like, it's-
[01:47:37.379 --> 01:47:40.099]  It's yeah, it's a satanic war on humanity, right?
[01:47:40.099 --> 01:47:44.219]  But the great thing about her is that at the end of her, spoiler alert, he actually realizes
[01:47:44.219 --> 01:47:46.460]  that this was ridiculous.
[01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:50.260]  I'm marrying an iOS and the girl that he should have been with the whole time, Amy Adams
[01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:53.019]  in the movie, who's right there next to him the whole time.
[01:47:53.019 --> 01:47:55.620]  Like he finally realizes on the rooftop at the end of the movie, I was like, oh, I should
[01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:57.780]  have actually just been with a real human being.
[01:47:57.780 --> 01:48:03.340]  Doesn't he realize that his bot girlfriend also has like a thousand other bot boyfriends?
[01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:06.019]  And the same way in 2049 too, Blade Runner 2049.
[01:48:06.019 --> 01:48:07.420]  By the way, Twitter was like that.
[01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:09.500]  80% or more was bots.
[01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:11.940]  People had weird fake liberal relationships.
[01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:12.940]  People patting them on the head.
[01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:13.940]  It was a pre-programmed bot.
[01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:14.940]  It was all fake.
[01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:19.179]  We were talking with some guys involved in tech last night at a bar and they were talking
[01:48:19.179 --> 01:48:21.519]  about how fake all that was, it was all engineered.
[01:48:21.519 --> 01:48:28.820]  And it was even engineered to individuals who might put out an idea that could go viral,
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:32.240]  that the intelligence agencies had it all structured to where anything that might go
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:35.019]  viral that was truthful was immediately shut down.
[01:48:35.019 --> 01:48:39.099]  And then all these former populist conservatives that played it cool and backed down, they
[01:48:39.099 --> 01:48:40.740]  thought they were winning.
[01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:42.580]  Still on Twitter, they were not winning.
[01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:43.860]  No, they were being censored.
[01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:44.860]  They were being shut down.
[01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:47.700]  They were being, everybody was flagged the whole time.
[01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:48.700]  And it was all fake.
[01:48:48.700 --> 01:48:51.780]  So you have to have an inner core connected to God, connected to your ancestors, your
[01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:55.900]  genetic code, your epigenetics, and follow that and know that's your North Star.
[01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:57.379]  That's your radar system.
[01:48:57.379 --> 01:48:58.460]  That will lead you to victory.
[01:48:58.460 --> 01:49:01.820]  You cannot follow anything it puts out, it'll lead you to destruction.
[01:49:01.820 --> 01:49:08.620]  Yeah, and be confident enough to be self empowered and to not default to ridiculous authorities,
[01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:09.620]  right?
[01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:13.900]  I mean, all of what this system is built on in many ways, the fallacy of authority.
[01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:17.980]  Think about all the people that bought into the stabbies, the vaccines, all this stuff.
[01:49:17.980 --> 01:49:23.219]  They just defaulted to who they were told was the authority, the manager.
[01:49:23.219 --> 01:49:27.179]  That would be easier, but it's not easier to submit to tyranny.
[01:49:27.179 --> 01:49:30.260]  Resistance is victory, submission is death in the system.
[01:49:30.260 --> 01:49:34.400]  And they use the fact that all your ancestral memory was your tribe was going to fight and
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:35.980]  die for you.
[01:49:35.980 --> 01:49:38.179]  And now you think the media and the culture is your tribe.
[01:49:38.179 --> 01:49:39.179]  It's not, it's artificial.
[01:49:39.179 --> 01:49:40.179]  Yeah.
[01:49:40.179 --> 01:49:41.179]  It wants to kill you.
[01:49:41.179 --> 01:49:42.460]  Synthetic masculinity.
[01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:46.500]  The football is one of the biggest, most ridiculous idols in the whole country.
[01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:47.500]  I can't stand it.
[01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:48.500]  Hold on.
[01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:49.500]  Let's go to break.
[01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:52.299]  We go a little bit in the next hour because if I'm here, I'm going to interrupt.
[01:49:52.299 --> 01:49:56.960]  So I want you guys to co-host, not that I want to be on air, we're going to go to break
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:57.960]  and we're going to come back.
[01:49:57.960 --> 01:49:59.940]  I'm going to be in the control room watching you guys.
[01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:02.660]  I want you guys just to go for like 20 minutes.
[01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:03.660]  You good for that?
[01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:04.660]  Sure.
[01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:07.940]  So Eric, air one promo guys, like a three minute, two minute promo.
[01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:12.340]  I want to come back with these amazing talk show hosts that know so much.
[01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:15.700]  And I do want to air this just cause I asked for it and I do want to get it.
[01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:17.019]  We haven't aired it enough.
[01:50:17.019 --> 01:50:18.019]  People love it.
[01:50:18.019 --> 01:50:19.620]  I was sent it again by one of my good friends today.
[01:50:19.620 --> 01:50:24.179]  It's this a Damon, a mini clip, it's a very short clip.
[01:50:24.179 --> 01:50:27.139]  I sent it to you guys.
[01:50:27.139 --> 01:50:32.200]  Very short little clip, but show showing a promo clip or a report and then let's come
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:36.379]  back and you guys like nail it and get to all just gush it all out what people need
[01:50:36.379 --> 01:50:37.379]  to know.
[01:50:37.379 --> 01:50:39.900]  Cause I'm, you know, hundreds of thousands are watching right now on a Saturday, millions
[01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:41.679]  will end up watching this as it's archived.
[01:50:42.519 --> 01:50:47.240]  This is very important because we're talking about our environment and humans are the only
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:51.960]  creature on this planet that really successfully controls this environment.
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:52.960]  That's our gift.
[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:58.960]  But if we don't control it ourselves as individuals and groups and let the globals control it,
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:50:59.960]  we're worse than animals.
[01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:00.960]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:05.920]  One of the things that I would recommend for people to go look at, and I don't care what
[01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:12.360]  you think about this guy who I'm about to mention, but I was sent a, a video yesterday
[01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:16.599]  and it's basically a documentary and late in the afternoon.
[01:51:16.599 --> 01:51:23.639]  So I watched it last night and it's, and it's by Alex Jones, Infowars and the media has
[01:51:23.639 --> 01:51:28.820]  tarnished him with all sorts of name calling conspiracy theorists, bomb thrower.
[01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:33.639]  The one thing that I know about this gentleman, Alex Jones is that, is that he loves this
[01:51:33.639 --> 01:51:34.879]  country.
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:37.000]  He is as smart as a whip.
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:44.799]  He, he absolutely believes in what he believes in and he also does his research and his homework.
[01:51:44.799 --> 01:51:49.040]  And so I sat because a close friend of mine said, you've got to watch this.
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:50.840]  I just finished watching it.
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:55.340]  He actually put it out yesterday and it's called an emergency broadcast and it's based
[01:51:55.340 --> 01:51:59.480]  on Infowars and it's based on the whole COVID lie.
[01:51:59.519 --> 01:52:05.480]  And, and Alex takes his audience through an hour and a half worth of just incredible level
[01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:14.480]  of detail of a, of a war game that our government did back in the 2016, 2017 timeframe with,
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:20.480]  with, you know, under a different name and they called it spars instead of SARS, COVID,
[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:21.480]  right?
[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:27.080]  And it's this incredible runs parallel to everything that's going on today, even in
[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:33.240]  a war game that they did almost five years ago now, four years ago now in the war game,
[01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:37.320]  they even put out social media things like tweets and such.
[01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:42.719]  And in the tweets that they use in the war game, they use the exact same tweets over
[01:52:42.719 --> 01:52:43.719]  the last year.
[01:52:43.719 --> 01:52:49.200]  I mean, the exact same words, the exact same hashtags, and it's like, it's one big setup.
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:54.280]  So let me, so that's just this thing that, this thing that Alex Jones put out yesterday,
[01:52:54.280 --> 01:53:00.320]  it needs to get out in a bigger way because Alex walks through and again, whatever, I
[01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:01.799]  don't care what people think of him.
[01:53:01.799 --> 01:53:04.840]  He's incredibly detailed in his research.
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:05.840]  He loves this country.
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:11.040]  He is a patriot and he's somebody who we better listen to or others in this country better
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:12.040]  listen to.
[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:17.320]  And there's a reason why the mainstream media calls a guy like him a bomb thrower or a conspiracy
[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:22.440]  theorist because they're, they're in fear of the truth that he does actually bring out.
[01:53:22.599 --> 01:53:28.320]  And in this particular documentary that he did yesterday, it's fascinating and it, there's
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:34.519]  an awful, awful lot of parallels in it from what was done in a war game, so to speak,
[01:53:34.519 --> 01:53:38.280]  quote unquote, and then what we, what the reality is that we're facing.
[01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:40.360]  There will be a surprise outbreak.
[01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:44.920]  There's no doubt in anyone's mind that they will be faced with the challenges that their
[01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:46.679]  predecessors were faced with.
[01:53:52.440 --> 01:54:07.960]  One of the things you've been talking about on your show is your allegation that government
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:13.719]  officials are aiding in pedophilia, child trafficking, and the grooming of children,
[01:54:13.719 --> 01:54:14.719]  right?
[01:54:14.719 --> 01:54:17.160]  You mean like what Jeffrey Epstein did with the clones?
[01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:40.360]  All right, Jamie, Hanshaw and Jay Dyer of jaysanalysis.com talking about the power of
[01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:44.840]  the family, the human species, men and women coming together on a team.
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:45.840]  That's what the system fears.
[01:54:46.559 --> 01:54:49.599]  So we're going to go about 15 minutes the next hour and then in this live transmission
[01:54:49.599 --> 01:54:53.920]  we'll re-loop until four p.m. tomorrow when I go live with the world war three special
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:57.679]  analysis that I've been really preparing for doing a lot of research on, but you guys have
[01:54:57.679 --> 01:55:00.320]  the floor down to cover for the next 20 minutes or so.
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:01.280]  Anything else you want to hit?
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:06.719]  Well, men and women coming together has to be divided, not just by sex spots, but also
[01:55:06.719 --> 01:55:08.400]  by ideologies that are pushed.
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:11.920]  For example, on the one hand you have, you know, this push for the incel guys out there
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:13.840]  and I'm not dissing those guys.
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:19.679]  They're being targeted to push them to where they hate women, as if the problem is the
[01:55:19.679 --> 01:55:20.639]  femininity of women.
[01:55:20.639 --> 01:55:22.879]  And then women are brainwashed with feminism.
[01:55:22.879 --> 01:55:24.639]  That's like the counterpart.
[01:55:24.639 --> 01:55:25.760]  The Japanese have bought that.
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:26.960]  Nobody's having kids and they're done.
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:27.280]  Exactly.
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:28.559]  That's the purpose of it, right?
[01:55:28.559 --> 01:55:29.440]  Sorry, I interrupted.
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:30.639]  I'm going to leave the studio.
[01:55:30.639 --> 01:55:31.120]  Go ahead.
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:32.000]  No, that's it, right?
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.360]  And that goes back to Plato's Republic.
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:38.639]  Plato had this idea of a lot of equality, gender equality.
[01:55:38.639 --> 01:55:42.480]  Plato was in many ways a feminist and he saw that as a way to control the society.
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:47.679]  For him, though, the feminist aspect was for that middle class of the guardian class
[01:55:47.679 --> 01:55:49.679]  who were above the proletariat working class.
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:54.320]  But going back to Plato's Republic, as I said, like, you know, we can kind of run through
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:56:00.719]  the different texts, about 20 texts we could say that from the writings of the elite are
[01:56:00.719 --> 01:56:05.040]  the battle plan, are the structure behind what they're bringing in for this new world
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:06.719]  or for this great reset right now.
[01:56:06.719 --> 01:56:09.840]  So the first one is Plato's Republic, which is, again, this communist socialist republic
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:15.519]  of a three-tiered system with the philosopher king at the top, run by a communistic guardian
[01:56:15.519 --> 01:56:20.240]  warrior class that shares all things in common, is totally equalitarian, totally feminist.
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:25.280]  And then you have the working class on the bottom that is kept in line through techni
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:28.719]  and through human depopulation and population control.
[01:56:28.719 --> 01:56:31.519]  You have to feed them the grain, keep them fat, dumb, and docile.
[01:56:31.519 --> 01:56:32.559]  Don't let them eat meat.
[01:56:32.559 --> 01:56:36.879]  And this ties into Hollywood because we'll go from the angel world all the way up to
[01:56:36.879 --> 01:56:37.760]  now.
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:42.240]  But there's a movie that actually has a perfect presentation of Plato's Republic in a kind
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:48.240]  of social way, in a future dystopian way, which is one of the first mega, I guess you
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:54.400]  could say, German expressionist satanic productions, which was Fritz Lang's Metropolis.
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:57:00.160]  Metropolis is about a giant future dystopia where the sex bots are let loose, which leads
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:02.240]  to this almost destruction of society.
[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:06.960]  And then they figure out that the society, which is built like a big man, a big body,
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:12.639]  right, the working classes, the body of the civilization, the guardian classes, the heart
[01:57:12.639 --> 01:57:16.240]  of the civilization, and the philosopher kings are the mind, the brains of the civilization.
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:17.519]  So society is a giant man.
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:21.200]  And you were going to say about Metropolis.
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:27.040]  Well, this futuristic city is divided into two distinct classes of workers and masters.
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:34.719]  And on that picture, one of the workers has a vision of the marching into the mouth of
[01:57:34.719 --> 01:57:35.120]  Moloch.
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:37.519]  And he's just chomping all of the workers.
[01:57:37.519 --> 01:57:41.280]  And this is the blood sacrifice that keeps the city running.
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:46.400]  And this movie is about the creation of a robot through black magic.
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:53.840]  And the sorcerer called Rotwang, he uses spells to, and part of his own body he sacrifices
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:57.200]  to animate the robot, who he names Maria.
[01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:01.599]  And he sends Maria to dance for the aristocratic class.
[01:58:01.599 --> 01:58:06.480]  Well, don't forget that she's created at the bottom of a giant inverted pentagram, right?
[01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:12.799]  So the AI bot, which becomes a sex bot, is created through the combination of magic and
[01:58:12.799 --> 01:58:13.200]  science.
[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:17.280]  So it's like a theosophy kind of creation.
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:21.519]  And German Expressionist film at this time was some of the first to use satanic imagery
[01:58:21.519 --> 01:58:22.480]  ever in film.
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:22.980]  Right.
[01:58:24.559 --> 01:58:27.280]  So did I say that robot was Moloch?
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:27.599]  Yeah.
[01:58:27.599 --> 01:58:28.480]  Oh, OK.
[01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:36.639]  So back maybe like 10 years ago, you had Beyonce in concert emulating this movie.
[01:58:36.639 --> 01:58:40.240]  And she would actually dress up as the robot from Metropolis.
[01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:44.639]  And even with the robotic glove that the sorcerer would wear.
[01:58:44.639 --> 01:58:49.440]  So they were bringing this out 10 years ago more.
[01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:53.120]  Well, but I mean, just the idea of in what was it, 19...
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:54.480]  What was that year of Metropolis?
[01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:55.040]  19...
[01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:55.679]  27.
[01:58:55.679 --> 01:58:56.559]  27.
[01:58:56.559 --> 01:59:00.320]  The prediction of AI bots, sex bots.
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:01.120]  I mean, that's wild.
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:03.440]  That's a long time before Anton LaVey, right?
[01:59:04.639 --> 01:59:09.599]  But yeah, and that's echoing Plato's model for how society is run, which is even though
[01:59:09.599 --> 01:59:13.440]  Plato wasn't talking about technology per se, he has this idea of society being controlled
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:18.400]  via techne, which is the principle of quantification and mathematization of all of society.
[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:24.799]  So it's the idea for a socialist technocracy way before people could perfect this with
[01:59:24.799 --> 01:59:26.639]  the advancement of the technology to do it.
[01:59:27.519 --> 01:59:30.480]  And you know that joke about Kevin Bacon and his six degrees.
[01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:33.599]  Well, it takes even less than that to get to Alistair Crowley in Hollywood.
[01:59:33.599 --> 01:59:39.120]  And he's the one who is capitulating this stratification of the aristocrats versus
[01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:39.760]  the servants.
[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:42.799]  And one of the dictums of the Book of the Law is the slave shall serve.
[01:59:43.519 --> 01:59:47.519]  L. Ron Hubbard, who is big in Hollywood, is a disciple of Crowley.
[01:59:47.519 --> 01:59:52.799]  L. Ron Hubbard's son said that Scientology is just one long black magic ritual played
[01:59:52.799 --> 01:59:56.320]  out over time rather than.
[01:59:57.120 --> 01:59:57.360]  Yeah.
[01:59:57.360 --> 02:00:03.519]  And it makes me think of Eyes Wide Shut, too, because Kubrick, who put in Eyes Wide Shut
[02:00:03.519 --> 02:00:10.320]  a significant symbolic role for Sea Org coming out of Scientology with the scenes where you
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:17.840]  see, you know, Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise having their marital spats and the infidelity
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:18.559]  that's going on.
[02:00:18.559 --> 02:00:25.120]  Then we have this situation with Kubrick making both 2001 A Space Odyssey, which is based
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:31.039]  on Clark's sort of Luciferian vision of the future, where we have a transhumanist depopulation
[02:00:31.039 --> 02:00:34.559]  situation going where the whole earth ultimately gets annihilated.
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:40.480]  Kubrick also was involved in writing the screenplay, if I recall, for AI, which Spielberg
[02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:41.280]  ended up making.
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:46.799]  That's about the end of humanity and the entities that go into the future, which you think at
[02:00:46.799 --> 02:00:49.360]  a certain point in the movie, you think they're aliens, but they're actually just advanced
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:49.760]  AI.
[02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:55.600]  So, you know, Kubrick is also consistently telling us this in his films, talking about
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:57.200]  the future of AI taking over.
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:00:59.440]  That's what your talk was about, all seeing AI.
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:03.680]  But as we work our way up through a lot of these global elite texts, you know, Tragedy
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:07.680]  and Hope, Angle American Establishment by Quigley, he was talking about in the 1950s
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:14.400]  and 60s how the future of society would be cities organized like Plato's Republic around
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:16.000]  giant supercomputers.
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:19.360]  So Quigley, there's a middle chapter in Tragedy and Hope, which he was Bill Clinton's
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:20.959]  mentor at Georgetown.
[02:01:20.959 --> 02:01:23.920]  That was a book written from the perspective of the CFR.
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:27.200]  He was an archivist for the CFR, Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:31.200]  Quigley is saying in the middle of that book that no, the future society is one where it's
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:35.680]  a smart city run by a supercomputer that controls every area of life.
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:37.600]  That is what's rolling out right now.
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:42.320]  So Quigley was writing about that from the elite's vantage point as an apologetic in
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:43.200]  Tragedy and Hope.
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:46.240]  Do you remember that early conspiracy movie called Zeitgeist?
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:47.039]  Oh, yeah, totally.
[02:01:47.039 --> 02:01:48.799]  So that was in three parts.
[02:01:48.799 --> 02:01:50.480]  So it was about taxes.
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:51.840]  It was about something else.
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:55.039]  And then it was about like Christ and Horus.
[02:01:55.039 --> 02:01:55.760]  Religion, yeah.
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:55.920]  Yeah.
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:59.680]  And so they presented a lot of good information.
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:05.440]  But at the end of it, you had to watch, I think, the sequel, Zeitgeist 2.
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:12.480]  Their answer to all of this was the smart city, the AI, which they called the Venus Project.
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:17.280]  Yeah, because Venus, that title with the UN, right?
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:18.160]  And UNESCO.
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:19.600]  Well, Venus is Lucifer.
[02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:20.799]  Venus is Lucifer, right.
[02:02:20.799 --> 02:02:25.120]  And Jacque Fresco and these different UN theorists had the idea of creating the
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:28.879]  Planopolis control grid coffin city, right?
[02:02:28.879 --> 02:02:31.120]  And Jacque Fresco was an antinatalist also.
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:31.760]  Absolutely.
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:32.480]  All these people are.
[02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:33.200]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:38.559]  And so as I was working through this list of globally tax, I just sort of sketched out
[02:02:38.559 --> 02:02:41.440]  about 20 or so that are worth looking at.
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:44.719]  And these are ones that we've actually lectured through in their entirety.
[02:02:44.719 --> 02:02:48.320]  So we've done about 50 or 60, but I listed about 20 or 30.
[02:02:48.879 --> 02:02:52.000]  There's a couple of good ones that are worth looking at that tie into this, which is
[02:02:52.959 --> 02:02:54.639]  Mark Curtis's Secret Affairs.
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:58.639]  That's a book which basically shows how the British Empire and the Royal Society,
[02:02:58.639 --> 02:03:03.120]  he's a Royal Society researcher, it's not a conspiracy text, how they utilized radical
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:06.400]  Islam in so many of these cases in the last century.
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:10.559]  British Empire funding, controlling, and using radical Islam.
[02:03:10.559 --> 02:03:15.360]  And then that model was picked up, of course, by Brzezinski and others who utilized the
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:20.160]  Mujahideen al-Qaeda and the conflict with the Soviets.
[02:03:21.039 --> 02:03:25.440]  And that's an Anglo-American strategy that, again, shows us that a lot of what we were
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:30.639]  told during the war on terror was just a phase that was sort of a controlled situation.
[02:03:30.639 --> 02:03:33.600]  They were actually allied with and using Islam.
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:38.160]  In the Milner Fabian conspiracy book by Yoan Ratio, he talks about how Islam is the key
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:44.480]  sort of tool in Europe for transforming Europe into, it's not because they like Islam or
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:49.519]  they believe Islam, Islam is just a tool on a chessboard, the grand chessboard, to transform
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:51.039]  Europe.
[02:03:51.039 --> 02:03:54.320]  And that's a key thing that both of those books, the Curtis book and the Yoan Ratio
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:54.799]  book show.
[02:03:55.519 --> 02:04:01.200]  And then we get to Anthony Sutton's Skull and Bones, which is the origin of the OSS
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:01.760]  and the CIA.
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:03.680]  They're all recruited out, Skull and Bones.
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:07.920]  He talks about in Wall Street, the Bolshevik Revolution, he talks about in Wall Street,
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:11.680]  The Rise of Hitler, how the industrialists, the banking elite, they all funded through
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:16.320]  these intelligence networks, through these backdoor black ops networks, all of these
[02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:18.240]  corrupt institutions that we know about today.
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:23.280]  And that takes us up to people like Lord Halford McKinder, who was one of these geopolitical
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:24.480]  strategists for the British Empire.
[02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:29.120]  Part of this Fabian society, he's the one that sketched out the control mechanism for
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:35.840]  how the Eastern, how Eurasia has to be controlled by controlling the Eurasian heartland, right?
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:39.280]  So the Western sea power, particularly at that time, the British Empire.
[02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:40.320]  Yes, exactly.
[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:45.039]  How to control the world through controlling the Eurasian heartland.
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:49.680]  That exact same strategy was picked up by Brzezinski and the American establishment,
[02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:53.200]  which is, again, basically the same model, the same strategy for global governance as
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:54.320]  the Milner-Fabian group.
[02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:58.879]  Did you want to comment on any of that stuff before I get into other structures?
[02:04:58.879 --> 02:05:02.320]  So Miles Copeland, a great book, the CIA operative.
[02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:08.320]  The reason Game of Nations is so crucial is that it's an insight into how during the Cold
[02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:14.480]  War, as a consultant, so-called, he was actually just doing that for CIA cover, how they restructured
[02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:18.080]  and changed the whole landscape of Egypt during the Cold War.
[02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:21.840]  And at the end of that book, you get all these insights into how they utilize terror, how
[02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:23.600]  they utilize false flags and all this stuff.
[02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:26.719]  He says at the end of the book, he says, you want to understand what we're actually doing
[02:05:26.719 --> 02:05:27.200]  in Egypt.
[02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:31.600]  He says, go read Bertrand Russell, Impact of Science on Society, Scientific Outlook.
[02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:34.959]  He says, and he says, read the Council on Foreign Relations publications on depopulation.
[02:05:34.959 --> 02:05:38.639]  Just because the ultimate goal of what we're doing, not just in Egypt, but in any of these
[02:05:38.639 --> 02:05:43.760]  countries where you have the coups, the industrialization, that's ultimately to change the
[02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:48.000]  demographics and to change those countries for depopulation long term.
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.120]  But here's the good news.
[02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:54.480]  There's a God of the universe, and we can have our own system.
[02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:57.440]  We don't have to follow these people just because they're organized doesn't mean they're
[02:05:57.440 --> 02:05:58.240]  all powerful.
[02:05:58.240 --> 02:05:59.120]  Absolutely.
[02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:00.160]  Yeah, they fail all the time.
[02:06:01.440 --> 02:06:02.320]  But they never give up.
[02:06:02.320 --> 02:06:03.680]  How do we unify and defeat them?
[02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:10.000]  Yeah, I think, again, we unify around the ideas that you talk about, that we talk about,
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000]  particularly biblical ideas.
[02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:18.480]  We unify around the idea of God, Christ, this idea of logos, logo centrism, logo phallicism.
[02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:20.719]  Those are actually good things are not bad things.
[02:06:20.719 --> 02:06:26.480]  So those are principles that we can unify, especially in our culture to fight against
[02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:28.320]  something that's so unnatural, right?
[02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:29.840]  It's very difficult.
[02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:33.840]  They can do it through just immense brainwashing and immense toxic environment.
[02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:35.680]  Don't get away with it if you're not aware of it.
[02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:36.799]  Exactly.
[02:06:36.799 --> 02:06:37.600]  That's a big part of it.
[02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:43.120]  But I think that returning to Christianity, returning to the Bible, we're Orthodox.
[02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:44.719]  We think those are good solutions.
[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:49.680]  And then I think getting out of the cities, getting on land, getting in the country.
[02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:51.039]  And not supporting the corporate system.
[02:06:51.039 --> 02:06:51.680]  Absolutely.
[02:06:51.680 --> 02:06:52.719]  Don't go to the box stores.
[02:06:52.719 --> 02:06:53.600]  Don't do any of that stuff.
[02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:57.120]  Don't support the online stuff like the big, huge corporations.
[02:06:57.120 --> 02:06:58.320]  And people have been doing that.
[02:06:58.879 --> 02:07:00.559]  McDonald's almost collapsed, all of it.
[02:07:00.559 --> 02:07:01.519]  That's why they're scared.
[02:07:01.519 --> 02:07:03.280]  Disney stock collapsed.
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:03.600]  Yeah.
[02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:04.879]  Let's talk about the victories we've had.
[02:07:05.519 --> 02:07:06.080]  Oh, man.
[02:07:07.519 --> 02:07:08.559]  The whole climate.
[02:07:08.559 --> 02:07:12.639]  Remember the first time that you had a huge victory that you popped champagne on air was
[02:07:12.639 --> 02:07:17.120]  when the climate emails came out and that was all exposed as a bunch of lies and scams.
[02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:20.879]  So that was a notable thing where people were starting to break through an alternative media
[02:07:20.879 --> 02:07:25.600]  to show that, no, you can actually expose these things and you can have victories.
[02:07:25.600 --> 02:07:27.200]  We've seen a lot of victories, right?
[02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:31.360]  Trump breaking the notion of mainstream media as this authoritative thing.
[02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:32.959]  He basically just got rid of that as an authority.
[02:07:32.959 --> 02:07:33.840]  Say what you want about Trump.
[02:07:33.840 --> 02:07:35.519]  They legitimately hate him.
[02:07:35.519 --> 02:07:38.160]  And it's because he was so good at that right there.
[02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:42.879]  Just that one thing is a positive, to break the stranglehold of mainstream media.
[02:07:42.879 --> 02:07:43.920]  He did that very well.
[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:46.559]  Now everybody doesn't trust mainstream media.
[02:07:46.559 --> 02:07:47.360]  Polls show that.
[02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:49.519]  We can have all kinds of victories.
[02:07:49.519 --> 02:07:54.879]  I think even though they did push through a lot of the COVID stuff, a lot of that scammery,
[02:07:54.879 --> 02:07:56.400]  that also woke a lot of people up.
[02:07:56.400 --> 02:07:58.799]  The trans stuff has woken a lot of people up.
[02:07:58.799 --> 02:08:05.440]  Well, I used to talk a lot about Disney 15, 20 years ago and people just look at me like
[02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:06.000]  I'm crazy.
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:13.519]  And then they just had last year that leaked meeting about how they want to put more trans
[02:08:13.519 --> 02:08:15.039]  propaganda in.
[02:08:15.039 --> 02:08:16.320]  Hell, it's all public now.
[02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:16.879]  Yeah.
[02:08:16.879 --> 02:08:19.280]  And so people are coming back to me and they're like, you were right.
[02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:20.400]  I'm like, yeah, I was right.
[02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:22.719]  Keep going, Tammy.
[02:08:22.719 --> 02:08:27.120]  Well, I think part of the solution is that we have to realize that we are created in
[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:31.840]  the image of God and altering that drastically is satanic.
[02:08:32.719 --> 02:08:37.680]  And occultists are obsessed with the idea of creating a new man or the Ubermensch.
[02:08:38.719 --> 02:08:39.920]  A man they control.
[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:40.639]  Yeah.
[02:08:40.639 --> 02:08:45.360]  So the transhumanist idea of apotheosis is to integrate man and computer.
[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:47.280]  And this is their forced evolution.
[02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:51.680]  And this also comes from Michael Aquino of the Temple of Set.
[02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:55.519]  This is all tied into the idea of the monolith.
[02:08:55.519 --> 02:08:57.760]  You mentioned Stanley Kubrick.
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:09:05.360]  So the monolith represents something that is interjected to force mankind into another
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:07.600]  evolutionary evolution.
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:07.840]  Yes.
[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:15.600]  So the transgenderism is just a stepping stone to like trans species and then transhumanism.
[02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:16.320]  Yeah.
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:17.680]  So integrate yourself.
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:21.760]  You change your DNA so you can be man and animal or you can be man and machine.
[02:09:22.559 --> 02:09:24.320]  But really, the corporations control it.
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:24.959]  Absolutely.
[02:09:24.959 --> 02:09:25.920]  And it's all a lie.
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:26.799]  It's all deception, right?
[02:09:26.799 --> 02:09:30.000]  I mean, so realizing there is this level of evil.
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.160]  I have a lot of people coming to me and say, you know what?
[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:34.240]  I didn't believe in God and believe in good and evil.
[02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:38.000]  But I realized that as crazy and evil as all this stuff is that's out in the open now,
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.920]  like if there's that much evil, there's got to be good.
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:43.280]  Well, Dr. Michael Yidan was the former head scientist at Pfizer.
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:45.440]  He says, I didn't believe in God before, but now I do.
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:46.480]  This is satanic.
[02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:46.959]  Exactly.
[02:09:46.959 --> 02:09:48.639]  He's got like 179 IQ.
[02:09:48.639 --> 02:09:51.120]  He's like, this is advanced.
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:52.559]  This is like really calculated.
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:55.120]  How could you have that coordination?
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:58.400]  Not just worldwide, but over many centuries, right?
[02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:02.959]  I mean, it's very hard for humans to, you know, for even a corporation, make it work,
[02:10:02.959 --> 02:10:05.039]  you know, for a significant amount of time.
[02:10:05.039 --> 02:10:09.360]  But to have this overall plan going back, you know, I mean, you could say the ancient world,
[02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:15.760]  yeah, but the modern instantiation of this imperium, this post-human, post-modern imperium,
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:17.760]  I mean, that's 100, 150 years old, right?
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:21.280]  How could you have that level of coordination and planning and strategy
[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:24.559]  without there being some unifying spiritual force?
[02:10:24.559 --> 02:10:25.920]  The Bible says it's the mystery of evil.
[02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:26.480]  Exactly.
[02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:28.400]  Yeah, that's a better explanation.
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:30.719]  Look at the explanatory power that that has.
[02:10:30.719 --> 02:10:32.080]  Well, plus they're worshiping it.
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:33.519]  They believe they're guided by a force.
[02:10:34.719 --> 02:10:37.039]  Yeah, you look at, you know, people who go...
[02:10:37.039 --> 02:10:40.240]  How many of their writings do they admit there's an outside force, like skull and bones?
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:42.160]  They're trying to get an outside entity to possess them.
[02:10:42.719 --> 02:10:43.920]  They're trying to avatar.
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:44.559]  They're trying to...
[02:10:44.559 --> 02:10:46.719]  A lot of these psychonauts, right?
[02:10:46.719 --> 02:10:50.639]  Tim Leary, John C. Lilly, a lot of the guys who were doing a lot of the
[02:10:50.639 --> 02:10:56.080]  pioneering research in MKUltra and LSD, they all pretty much openly talked about
[02:10:56.080 --> 02:10:59.680]  interfacing with entities that were helping them and giving them ideas.
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:02.879]  You know, John C. Lilly says this in his autobiography.
[02:11:02.879 --> 02:11:07.519]  He says that when I would go into the float tank, I would, you know, be high on ketamine
[02:11:07.519 --> 02:11:08.559]  or LSD or whatever.
[02:11:08.559 --> 02:11:11.600]  He says, I would dissociate and I would go into the outer reaches.
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:14.799]  And he says, I would have interactions with these entities, these beings.
[02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:20.080]  And he says, they were the ones telling me, you know, use this, do this technology,
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:20.719]  put their RFID.
[02:11:20.719 --> 02:11:22.400]  He was pioneering a lot of RFID.
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:23.519]  He was putting it in the dolphin.
[02:11:23.519 --> 02:11:31.120]  Oh, Huxley and his Galton, like in the 1850s, was envisioning all this.
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:33.200]  And they were doing a lot of hallucinogens, right?
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:34.799]  Huxley was a huge promoter of that.
[02:11:34.799 --> 02:11:38.799]  He was saying that I was getting inspirations and ideas through...
[02:11:38.799 --> 02:11:41.280]  He thought LSD would be this great liberating thing, right?
[02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:44.799]  That humanity would go into a new age through LSD.
[02:11:44.799 --> 02:11:48.160]  But the entities always say the same things, right?
[02:11:49.039 --> 02:11:52.240]  Plus, if you're already in a trance and already under their control,
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:53.200]  it just makes it stronger.
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:53.600]  It does.
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:55.039]  Yeah, you're more under the delusion.
[02:11:55.039 --> 02:11:56.000]  You double down, right?
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.959]  But the entities always say, form a world government and kill everybody.
[02:11:59.519 --> 02:12:00.320]  Or kill yourself.
[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:01.920]  So why do the aliens want that?
[02:12:02.799 --> 02:12:03.840]  Because they're demons.
[02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:09.840]  They're demonic forces that represent a older, you could say, race of beings,
[02:12:10.719 --> 02:12:11.920]  you know, demons, basically.
[02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:13.039]  That don't want us around.
[02:12:13.039 --> 02:12:15.200]  They hate humanity because humans are made in the image of God.
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:20.559]  And what God has planned for humans is to raise them to a level even above the angelic,
[02:12:20.559 --> 02:12:21.120]  Paul says.
[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:22.639]  He says, we will judge the angels.
[02:12:22.639 --> 02:12:25.440]  And so there's this enmity, this hatred.
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:26.799]  So it's class envy.
[02:12:26.799 --> 02:12:28.799]  Yeah, they hate us because we're made...
[02:12:28.799 --> 02:12:29.760]  I mean, that really is it.
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:33.600]  I mean, look how we recognize beauty and the machine can't do that.
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:34.559]  We see a sunset.
[02:12:34.559 --> 02:12:35.360]  We see the fog.
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:36.400]  We see the trees.
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:37.120]  We see the birds.
[02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:37.760]  We see the woman.
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:38.400]  We see the man.
[02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:39.519]  We see our children.
[02:12:39.519 --> 02:12:40.879]  We see what is good.
[02:12:40.879 --> 02:12:44.559]  The fact that we can recognize and resonate with God's own program.
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:46.000]  They don't like that.
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:46.799]  And they want to destroy us.
[02:12:46.799 --> 02:12:51.840]  And if they can attack us at an embryonic, larval level, they believe they've had a victory.
[02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:56.559]  And God, to give us free will, had to cast us into this situation or we would not be free.
[02:12:57.440 --> 02:12:57.840]  Yeah.
[02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:01.360]  If you look at the art of H.R. Giger, he's a great example of this because...
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:02.000]  Alien.
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:03.360]  He was a Luciferian.
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:05.840]  By a self-confessed absolute 100%.
[02:13:06.559 --> 02:13:07.760]  Pull up Geiger Art.
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:08.639]  Yeah.
[02:13:08.639 --> 02:13:12.959]  And you'll notice that a lot of it is both at once transhumanist and satanic and a lot
[02:13:12.959 --> 02:13:14.080]  of dead babies, right?
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:15.680]  And so the spirit...
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:19.600]  Well, it's male and females entering an alien and then feeding off dead babies.
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:20.639]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:13:20.639 --> 02:13:29.920]  And that's because the impetus that he's expressing artistically there is that demonic impetus
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:34.240]  to not just destroy humanity, but give this idea that you can merge humanity with these
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:35.039]  machines.
[02:13:35.039 --> 02:13:37.039]  And if you want to know what that's supposed to be...
[02:13:37.039 --> 02:13:38.080]  Well, it's rape.
[02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:39.280]  It's aliens raping humans.
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:45.200]  In the movie Alien, it is, according to Ridley Scott, he said he wanted to portray humans
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:47.519]  being raped by these entities, by these...
[02:13:47.519 --> 02:13:50.480]  And I don't want to sound like a square, but I remember like four or five years ago,
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:52.559]  it came out like liberals are into tentacle porn.
[02:13:52.559 --> 02:13:53.280]  I'm like, what is that?
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:54.160]  So I looked it up.
[02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:56.240]  It's aliens raping women and children.
[02:13:57.200 --> 02:13:58.080]  It's this.
[02:13:58.080 --> 02:13:58.559]  Exactly.
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:01.920]  By the way, he has a drawing he did in honor of Crowley too.
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:03.920]  So he was very much into Crowley.
[02:14:03.920 --> 02:14:05.600]  There's one he did of Baphomet with...
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:08.160]  The babies are like fueling the system.
[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:08.639]  Exactly.
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:13.519]  Could you pull up a slide that is Arthur C. Clarke's book, 2019?
[02:14:13.519 --> 02:14:14.959]  Oh, this will blow you away.
[02:14:14.959 --> 02:14:15.120]  Yeah.
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:19.680]  And you just made me think of Childhood's End, which made me think of Arthur C. Clarke.
[02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:24.480]  So this is a book about an alien race that comes to earth, but they do not come all the
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:24.799]  way down.
[02:14:24.799 --> 02:14:25.840]  They just hover above.
[02:14:26.559 --> 02:14:33.039]  And until we get used to what they are offering, new technologies, medical advancements, things
[02:14:33.039 --> 02:14:37.440]  like that, because they don't want to reveal themselves because they look exactly like
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:38.240]  the devil.
[02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:40.400]  And what they want is the children.
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:41.680]  And then they want to nuke the world.
[02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:44.400]  And we had an archetypal pre-programming against them.
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:46.879]  That's why we're against them, that God gave us.
[02:14:46.879 --> 02:14:48.480]  Like, watch out when these show up.
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:52.480]  It's like God kind of seeded us and moved on, but we were given a warning.
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:53.600]  Yeah.
[02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:56.160]  Humans love fiction stories, fiction presentations.
[02:14:56.160 --> 02:14:57.200]  They're a lot more powerful.
[02:14:57.200 --> 02:15:01.680]  And you notice that Jamie has in her presentation, there's an Arthur C. Clarke book that came
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:02.719]  out in the 1980s.
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:06.480]  And in this book, he says, I'm going to give you a projection of what life's going to be
[02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:07.519]  like in 2019.
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:11.440]  And he's got a personal to add for 2019.
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:12.000]  Yeah.
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:12.959]  Look at this.
[02:15:12.959 --> 02:15:18.480]  Married white female, 40, seeks well-endowed single white male, three-month intimate companionship.
[02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:24.000]  My husband's hormone treatments, my husband, six months pregnant, my husband's pregnant,
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:25.200]  have put him out of commission.
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:29.200]  Please show us your vaccination status.
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:30.719]  He wrote that in the 1980s.
[02:15:30.719 --> 02:15:31.519]  All pre-programmed.
[02:15:31.519 --> 02:15:32.000]  Read that again.
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:33.200]  This is so incredible.
[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:38.080]  Married white female, 46, well-endowed single white male, 18 to 28, three-month intimate
[02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:38.719]  companionship.
[02:15:38.719 --> 02:15:43.440]  My husband's hormone treatments, because he's six months pregnant, husband's pregnant,
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:45.039]  have put him out of commission.
[02:15:45.039 --> 02:15:46.080]  I will take care of you.
[02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:47.840]  Electrosimulation is OK.
[02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:49.680]  Drug-induced orgasms.
[02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:52.400]  But I prefer a partner with original equipment.
[02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:54.799]  Also send us your vaccination status.
[02:15:55.600 --> 02:15:56.160]  1987.
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:57.360]  And people say, how did he predict it?
[02:15:57.360 --> 02:15:58.320]  No, it's their program.
[02:15:58.320 --> 02:15:59.120]  It's their cult.
[02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:00.080]  He's part of the planners.
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:03.039]  He invented the telecommunication satellite.
[02:16:03.039 --> 02:16:03.760]  He's one of the planners.
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:04.260]  OSS.
[02:16:05.039 --> 02:16:10.240]  One of the planners involved in rolling out this technocracy, which has been in the works
[02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:11.920]  going back, again, 100, 150 years.
[02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:14.879]  Totally incredible.
[02:16:14.879 --> 02:16:16.959]  Guys, each of you, two-minute closing comment.
[02:16:18.879 --> 02:16:25.840]  I would say that the documents, all this research, all this does is show us the reality of what's
[02:16:25.840 --> 02:16:26.559]  going on.
[02:16:26.559 --> 02:16:30.000]  This is basically a window into how the world really works.
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:33.760]  You can't go to the mainstream media, the university system, even.
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:38.720]  It's so much brainwashing that there's some universities that can give you a good insight
[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:39.279]  into this.
[02:16:39.279 --> 02:16:44.960]  But what I'm doing, what we're looking at here is basically what people at the Kissinger
[02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:46.400]  level would be studying.
[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:48.640]  I'm not saying that I'm Henry Kissinger.
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:49.439]  I'm not at that level.
[02:16:49.439 --> 02:16:51.279]  I'm just saying that the types of research.
[02:16:51.279 --> 02:16:53.760]  No, but you put yourself at that level, but you're not for them.
[02:16:53.760 --> 02:16:55.760]  If you just study it, they think we're animals.
[02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:56.640]  You know what they're doing.
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:16:57.520]  They can't stand that.
[02:16:57.520 --> 02:16:58.800]  This is what they read.
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:01.119]  This is their level of understanding.
[02:17:01.119 --> 02:17:02.240]  And that's what we're trying to look at here.
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:04.720]  And the answer is, again, pretty simple.
[02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:05.200]  There's good.
[02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:05.840]  There's evil.
[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:06.400]  It's God.
[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:07.119]  That's the answer.
[02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:09.119]  And that's what we try to show.
[02:17:09.119 --> 02:17:11.279]  That's what we try to demonstrate in our research.
[02:17:11.279 --> 02:17:13.119]  And so I think that's what we do.
[02:17:13.119 --> 02:17:15.439]  That's what we want to put forward, positive message.
[02:17:15.439 --> 02:17:17.520]  We don't have to be black pilled and miserable.
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:19.039]  But that's what we do.
[02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:25.520]  Well, I want to take that clip with Arthur C. Clark from the 1980s, predicting the future.
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:29.039]  When we put this as an archive up, tell Drew when he posts this in about an hour.
[02:17:29.039 --> 02:17:30.080]  It's a live feed right now.
[02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:34.720]  It'll restream until tomorrow at 4pm when I do the big World War III special.
[02:17:34.720 --> 02:17:35.520]  It's so important.
[02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:40.720]  Believe me, folks, you want to tune into the show tomorrow at 4pm on Sunday, February 19th.
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:42.240]  But right now it's February 18th.
[02:17:43.439 --> 02:17:47.840]  I want to take that clip of you right up front with that Arthur C. Clark clip and put that
[02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:51.600]  right on the front of the video so that people realize what they're about to watch and to
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:53.840]  show how pre-planned this all is.
[02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:56.800]  All right, Jamie, go ahead, closing comments.
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:03.360]  Well, I definitely think that they are on the defensive now and we are on the offensive.
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:08.720]  It's all coming out thanks to the internet, which could have been a super destructive
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:13.119]  thing, but it's being used for good.
[02:18:13.119 --> 02:18:20.000]  I think now, in my opinion, even TikTok is being used as a huge platform to get people
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:20.800]  to wake up.
[02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:25.039]  And I feel like there's some kind of tide turning.
[02:18:25.039 --> 02:18:26.560]  I'm seeing more vindication.
[02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:30.720]  We're getting more and more viewers.
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:37.039]  And like he said, we have joined the Orthodox Church, and I think that's the final solution
[02:18:37.039 --> 02:18:44.480]  is get your own spiritual relationship in order so that you know how to have discernment
[02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:46.640]  and wisdom when dealing with these things.
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:53.039]  That's Jamie Hanshaw, author and researcher, host of Out of This World podcast on YouTube,
[02:18:53.039 --> 02:18:55.039]  jdyerjaysanalysis.com.
[02:18:55.039 --> 02:18:56.000]  Incredible job.
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:56.800]  Great job with the crew.
[02:18:56.800 --> 02:18:59.039]  We're going to restream this now until 4 p.m.
[02:18:59.039 --> 02:18:59.439]  tomorrow.
[02:18:59.439 --> 02:19:01.200]  Folks, you are more important than we are.
[02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:02.000]  This is key info.
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:03.520]  We had to build this infrastructure.
[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:05.760]  All this work went into this because of past support.
[02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:09.119]  Now you promoting this and sharing it and taking clips out.
[02:19:09.119 --> 02:19:10.080]  It's all free to air.
[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:11.200]  No copyright.
[02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:12.720]  Share it, copy it, do whatever you want.
[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:15.039]  Just get it out right now.
[02:19:15.039 --> 02:19:16.800]  The ball is in your court.
[02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:18.160]  Everything is in your hands.
[02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:19.119]  This is your mission.
[02:19:19.119 --> 02:19:21.439]  Should you choose to accept it, we're going to win together.
[02:19:21.439 --> 02:19:22.880]  You see huge victories happening.
[02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:25.039]  Most people don't get to fight tyranny and see it in their lifetime.
[02:19:25.039 --> 02:19:26.320]  We are seeing it right now.
[02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:30.480]  So share the live link and share the archive once it's on Banned On video.
[02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:36.960]  God bless and good luck.
