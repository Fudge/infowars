[00:00.000 --> 00:12.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, May 3, 2016, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:12.720 --> 00:16.200]  This is going to be another incredibly important transmission.
[00:16.200 --> 00:17.200]  Stay with us.
[00:17.200 --> 00:22.600]  But first, the globalist puppet Obama rubs the American people's faces in the tyranny.
[00:22.600 --> 00:28.720]  According to a Pew Research poll, mainstream media has a 6% approval rating.
[00:28.720 --> 00:29.720]  Think about that.
[00:29.720 --> 00:35.520]  Globalist megabanks controlling the perception of the American masses for their own gain
[00:35.520 --> 00:37.880]  isn't a passive event.
[00:37.880 --> 00:44.260]  What lurks behind that dismal approval rating is a roaring distrust that will eventually
[00:44.260 --> 00:50.560]  morph into a hammer of truth shattering all of the propaganda clamoring for the attention
[00:50.560 --> 00:53.480]  of 320 million people.
[00:53.480 --> 01:00.240]  That bubble of overpaid, softest minions churning out their American version of Pravda sat comfortably
[01:00.240 --> 01:05.000]  at the White House Correspondents' Dinner over the weekend, chuckling with sycophantic
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.640]  glee in the presence of the most non-transparent president in the history of the United States
[01:10.640 --> 01:11.640]  of America.
[01:11.640 --> 01:17.800]  Eight years ago, I was a young man full of idealism and vigor.
[01:17.800 --> 01:20.760]  And look at me now.
[01:20.760 --> 01:34.280]  I am gray, grizzled, discounting down the days till my death panel, at home and abroad,
[01:34.280 --> 01:41.200]  journalists like all of you engage in the dogged pursuit of informing citizens and holding
[01:41.200 --> 01:47.360]  leaders accountable and making our government of the people possible.
[01:47.360 --> 01:51.920]  And it's an enormous responsibility, and I realize it's an enormous challenge at a time
[01:51.920 --> 01:59.520]  when the economics of the business sometimes incentivize speed over depth, and when controversy
[01:59.520 --> 02:06.360]  and conflict are what most immediately attract readers and viewers, the good news is there's
[02:06.360 --> 02:13.360]  so many of you that are pushing against those trends, and in such a climate, it's not enough
[02:13.360 --> 02:19.320]  just to give people a megaphone, and that's why your power and your responsibility to
[02:19.320 --> 02:26.240]  dig and to question and to counter distortions and untruths is more important than ever.
[02:26.240 --> 02:32.520]  Taking a stand on behalf of what is true does not require you shedding your objectivity.
[02:32.520 --> 02:38.880]  In fact, it is the essence of good journalism.
[02:38.880 --> 02:44.240]  But for a brief moment, Comedian Larry Wilmore brought some clarity to the dulled senses
[02:44.240 --> 02:46.960]  of the media whores sipping their champagne.
[02:46.960 --> 02:52.000]  MSNBC got rid of so many black people, I thought Boko Haram was running that network.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  What was going on?
[02:54.000 --> 02:58.480]  Some of America's finest black journalists are here tonight.
[02:58.480 --> 03:01.480]  Don Lemons here too.
[03:01.480 --> 03:06.480]  Hey, John, how's it going?
[03:06.480 --> 03:11.120]  A ledge journalist, Don Lemons, everybody, but I have to say, it's great.
[03:11.120 --> 03:15.280]  It looks like you're really enjoying your last year of the presidency.
[03:15.280 --> 03:20.000]  Saw you hanging out with NBA players like Steph Curry, Golden State Warriors.
[03:20.000 --> 03:21.000]  That was cool.
[03:21.000 --> 03:22.000]  That was cool.
[03:22.000 --> 03:23.000]  Yeah.
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  You know, it kind of makes sense too, because both of you like raining down bombs on people
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  from long distances, right?
[03:28.000 --> 03:29.000]  Yeah?
[03:29.000 --> 03:30.000]  I'm sure.
[03:30.000 --> 03:31.000]  What?
[03:31.000 --> 03:32.000]  Am I wrong?
[03:32.000 --> 03:33.000]  What?
[03:33.000 --> 03:36.880]  Speaking of drones, how is Wolf Blitzer still on television?
[03:36.880 --> 03:41.680]  Ask a follow-up question.
[03:41.680 --> 03:46.040]  Hey, Wolf, I'm ready to project tonight's winner.
[03:46.040 --> 03:48.440]  Anyone that isn't watching the situation room.
[03:48.440 --> 03:50.440]  Oh, what's that?
[03:50.440 --> 03:54.960]  Who are you killing tonight?
[03:54.960 --> 03:56.080]  Can't be print journalism.
[03:56.080 --> 03:59.000]  That industry's been dead for a while now, right?
[03:59.000 --> 04:00.000]  Sorry.
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  See you tonight.
[04:05.000 --> 04:06.000]  See you tonight.
[04:06.000 --> 04:07.000]  Look at those traders.
[04:07.000 --> 04:08.000]  This guy knows they're dead.
[04:08.000 --> 04:09.000]  It's been a long time.
[04:09.000 --> 04:10.000]  Yep.
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  Used to watch it back when it was the news network.
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  He's not even taking a risk going after him.
[04:14.000 --> 04:15.000]  He knows it.
[04:15.000 --> 04:16.000]  That guy's smart.
[04:16.000 --> 04:17.000]  Don't get him on.
[04:17.000 --> 04:18.000]  We're all seeing it tonight.
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.280]  Since the Smith-Mont Act was quietly overturned in 2013, legalizing propaganda to be fed to
[04:23.280 --> 04:29.960]  the American people, I humbly call out of pure reason that the Pulitzer, the Emmys,
[04:29.960 --> 04:35.360]  the Peabody, the Edward R. Murrow, and all the other prizes awarded to journalists since
[04:35.360 --> 04:38.680]  2013 be returned.
[04:38.680 --> 04:44.000]  And all of these awards to be put on hold until American journalism is returned to its
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.240]  proper status as stated in the First Amendment.
[04:48.240 --> 04:53.200]  In medical news tonight, a chip the size of a grain of rice could save your life.
[04:53.200 --> 04:56.440]  I don't wait around and watch my family die around me.
[04:56.440 --> 05:05.160]  This is John Bowne, FreeFromWords.com.
[05:05.160 --> 05:10.960]  As the Republican primary sees and winds down, there is one true front-runner.
[05:10.960 --> 05:14.360]  Like it or not, Donald Trump has a commanding lead.
[05:14.360 --> 05:19.440]  But he's still being followed, although distantly, by Ted Cruz and John Kasich.
[05:19.440 --> 05:26.120]  Join us Tuesday, 7 o'clock PM Central, for live coverage of the Indiana primary results.
[05:26.120 --> 05:29.800]  Will this be the death nail in Ted Cruz's political coffin?
[05:29.800 --> 05:35.360]  Or will he continue to wander around the country like a dead zombie in search of more
[05:35.360 --> 05:36.360]  delegates?
[05:36.360 --> 05:41.720]  That's right, live coverage and analysis, and we'll take your phone calls.
[05:41.720 --> 05:48.040]  7 o'clock PM Central, this Tuesday, Infowars.com, forward slash show, and join us on our YouTube
[05:48.040 --> 05:51.320]  stream at the Alex Jones channel.
[05:51.320 --> 05:54.640]  Infowars live coverage of the Indiana primary, don't miss it.
[05:54.640 --> 05:56.800]  What are you doing to fight these people?
[05:56.800 --> 06:01.800]  Get out there, take action.
[06:01.800 --> 06:07.640]  For a limited time, Infowars select storeable foods that are the highest quality, longest
[06:07.640 --> 06:12.080]  lasting, produced right here in the U.S. foods are 30 to 40% off retail.
[06:12.080 --> 06:13.640]  Now let me tell you why that's so important.
[06:13.640 --> 06:18.760]  We only do this special twice a year, and we are contractually allowed to offer prices
[06:18.760 --> 06:23.760]  even lower than the prices that my patron supply offers, and that superduces us food.
[06:23.760 --> 06:27.360]  They're our sponsor, we sell their food at Infowarsstore.com.
[06:27.360 --> 06:31.840]  It's an incredibly good deal, but right next to it is our food, the same food, private
[06:31.840 --> 06:37.720]  labeled, and it's a contract loophole where we can offer it lower than anyone else, including
[06:37.720 --> 06:38.840]  their other distributors.
[06:38.840 --> 06:44.240]  I did this because of Infowars power in the market to leverage in free market to bring
[06:44.240 --> 06:50.200]  you the very best deals, and quite frankly that helps us then sell even more food and
[06:50.200 --> 06:51.960]  help fund this operation.
[06:51.960 --> 06:57.800]  So for a limited time, 40 to 30% off all the Infowars select storeable food at Infowarsstore.com
[06:57.800 --> 07:01.800]  or by calling toll-free 888-2533139.
[07:01.800 --> 07:05.400]  Infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[07:05.400 --> 07:10.840]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market,
[07:10.840 --> 07:15.840]  a highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used
[07:15.840 --> 07:21.960]  by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health, sourced from top leading manufacturers
[07:21.960 --> 07:27.600]  to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients, extracted directly from the wild
[07:27.600 --> 07:32.720]  herb, and sealed in easy to use capsules you will no longer need to endure the burning
[07:32.720 --> 07:34.720]  of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[07:34.720 --> 07:39.360]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and
[07:39.360 --> 07:44.160]  enhance overall health, wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts
[07:44.160 --> 07:47.640]  agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[07:47.640 --> 07:52.960]  This winter season it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[07:52.960 --> 08:13.440]  Now available at Infowarslife.com, that's Infowarslife.com or call 888-2533139.
[08:13.440 --> 08:27.680]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:27.680 --> 08:32.160]  Tuesday, May 3rd, 2016.
[08:32.160 --> 08:40.960]  We're going into world government, the globalist are collapsing industries, cities, states,
[08:40.960 --> 08:50.640]  regions, countries, and building armored compound fortresses, returning to the dark age model.
[08:50.640 --> 08:59.040]  The social contract has been broken by design to bring in a long de-evolution of civilization
[08:59.040 --> 09:03.800]  for the general human world.
[09:03.800 --> 09:07.640]  Classical tyranny is now being integrated with high tech control.
[09:07.640 --> 09:14.360]  Only a mass awakening, a transcendence and a discovery of the enemy plan and an admission
[09:14.360 --> 09:19.480]  of the enemy plan attacking us at point blank range.
[09:19.480 --> 09:27.280]  Only an awakening to the giant monster in the room will allow us to overthrow this system.
[09:27.280 --> 09:32.920]  We have a very good chance at defeating it because it's based on destroying prosperity,
[09:32.920 --> 09:39.160]  destroying honor, destroying competition, destroying free will and free association.
[09:39.160 --> 09:46.520]  It is anathema to the general human will, but the globalist combines wickedly wish for
[09:46.520 --> 09:51.680]  total control over the species and the future, and they intend to get full control.
[09:51.680 --> 09:55.600]  They're not there yet, and their attempts to get there, they are pushing us towards
[09:55.600 --> 10:05.080]  global conflict, economic collapse, and societal degeneration.
[10:05.080 --> 10:09.800]  They are setting up frauds, they are setting up systems that consolidate and destroy all
[10:09.800 --> 10:14.240]  prosperity outside of their controlled systems.
[10:14.240 --> 10:23.240]  As a plan, this is not mismanagement, this is a scientifically directed Agenda 21 post-industrial
[10:23.240 --> 10:24.240]  program.
[10:24.240 --> 10:31.560]  Now when I say post-industrial, that's for you and I, we'll still have our little smartphones
[10:31.560 --> 10:39.880]  and bobbles that surveil us and track us like sentinel sentries in the prison, Panoptagon.
[10:39.880 --> 10:44.200]  But the real civilization and the real freedom of travel and the real freedom of raising
[10:44.200 --> 10:49.440]  your children and having your own ideas is being swept away.
[10:49.440 --> 10:53.200]  The good news is there are massive awakenings taking place.
[10:53.200 --> 10:55.360]  Here's what's coming up today.
[10:55.360 --> 11:02.880]  Lord Moncton, the champion of trying to get the UK out of the EU and one of the founders
[11:02.880 --> 11:09.320]  of UKIP taking Europe and the UK by storm, populist, patriot, libertarian party, will
[11:09.320 --> 11:16.840]  be joining us to discuss the move to bring England, Ireland, Scotland, Northern Ireland
[11:16.840 --> 11:22.280]  out of the globalist system that will then obviously cause a chain reaction.
[11:22.280 --> 11:30.720]  This is a massive event and Harold's, the new world order project is in deep trouble.
[11:30.720 --> 11:36.920]  We'll try to reconstitute it in other ways, but this is a devastating setback for the
[11:36.920 --> 11:37.920]  enemy.
[11:37.920 --> 11:48.480]  When I say enemy, I mean you're my, my family's mortal, sworn agents of death.
[11:48.480 --> 11:52.760]  That's the globalist, the ones that have the abortuaries and sell the baby parts and grow
[11:52.760 --> 11:59.800]  humanoids and cows for harvesting those people as cold-blooded and psychopathic as Satan's
[11:59.800 --> 12:03.400]  third eye.
[12:03.400 --> 12:06.240]  Now we're going to get into that.
[12:06.240 --> 12:08.920]  We're going to get into the Trump campaign, all the things that are happening and Trump
[12:08.920 --> 12:17.400]  surging nationally in polls to a gigantic lead nationally, surging past Hillary.
[12:17.400 --> 12:20.080]  We're going to be getting to all of that.
[12:20.080 --> 12:31.520]  He now has a 34-point jumbo lead in California over Cruz and it's accelerating daily.
[12:31.520 --> 12:39.120]  The neocon crime syndicate has gone into conniption fit overdrive, activating Glenn Beck and
[12:39.120 --> 12:42.040]  Ted Cruz to say everyone must fast.
[12:42.040 --> 12:46.160]  Basically, this is a choice between good and evil, close quote.
[12:46.160 --> 12:53.000]  This is like Christ, Trump is like the devil and trying to invoke Christianity and just
[12:53.000 --> 13:01.000]  ghost dance, end of days type cultism to try to manipulate Christians that they need to
[13:01.000 --> 13:02.000]  do this.
[13:02.000 --> 13:08.040]  This is totally cold-blooded, absolutely synthetic coming from these two sociopaths in my educated,
[13:08.040 --> 13:11.520]  informed analysis.
[13:11.520 --> 13:12.520]  That's all up on DrudgeReport.com.
[13:12.520 --> 13:15.680]  We've got a lot of news obviously up on M4Words.com.
[13:15.680 --> 13:18.400]  We're also going to get to some other key health news.
[13:18.400 --> 13:20.400]  This has been known for over 100 years.
[13:20.400 --> 13:25.640]  In fact, the Romans, if somebody was sick, they would say get them up on the roof, get
[13:25.640 --> 13:29.520]  them in a loincloth, have them sit out in the sun for four or five hours if they didn't
[13:29.520 --> 13:30.880]  have any sun.
[13:30.880 --> 13:32.200]  Go out and get fresh air.
[13:32.200 --> 13:33.560]  Doctors always say that.
[13:33.560 --> 13:38.800]  You watch Mayberry shows, the Andy Griffiths show, and somebody sick, the doctor says,
[13:38.800 --> 13:43.240]  wow, you need some fresh air and sunshine and you need some milk.
[13:43.240 --> 13:44.240]  Everybody already knows this.
[13:44.240 --> 13:51.000]  Here it is, Daily Mail, big study, how sunshine cuts blood pressure and makes you thinner.
[13:51.000 --> 13:54.320]  New research reveals benefits that aren't linked to vitamin D. Vitamin D is part of
[13:54.320 --> 13:55.320]  it.
[13:55.320 --> 13:58.520]  Your body produces vitamin D whether it's the type it can absorb, but the bigger issue
[13:58.520 --> 14:01.480]  is the nitrous oxide in the blood.
[14:01.480 --> 14:06.480]  Look, personally, I can be a little bit down, exhausted, go out and get an hour of serious
[14:06.480 --> 14:07.480]  sun.
[14:07.480 --> 14:12.040]  I just feel rejuvenated.
[14:12.040 --> 14:13.040]  We're just like plants.
[14:13.040 --> 14:16.160]  We don't have photosynthesis, but we basically have something very, very similar that goes
[14:16.160 --> 14:17.160]  on in our skin.
[14:17.160 --> 14:19.400]  And yes, you will die from too much sun.
[14:19.400 --> 14:20.840]  You will die quicker without it.
[14:20.840 --> 14:25.400]  That's why Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations are, remember, once being in the
[14:25.400 --> 14:32.760]  sun banned, he wants by law 50% sunscreen and arresting people that say it's good like
[14:32.760 --> 14:35.520]  he wants global warming deniers arrested.
[14:35.520 --> 14:38.000]  Just go read his papers.
[14:38.000 --> 14:45.800]  Because that creature knows that you are absolutely dependent on the sun, like everything else
[14:45.800 --> 14:47.360]  on this planet.
[14:47.360 --> 14:53.320]  But of course, the UN likes to protect their God.
[14:53.320 --> 14:56.320]  And so that's why they voted five years ago to say the sun doesn't affect climate or
[14:56.320 --> 14:57.480]  anything else.
[14:57.480 --> 15:01.120]  That is the most asinine statement the planet has ever seen.
[15:01.120 --> 15:02.120]  But I'm digressing.
[15:02.120 --> 15:07.920]  We've got exclusive reports here from Reitbart, a chart, deportation, budget shows 25%.
[15:07.920 --> 15:14.400]  Increase in the budget, while deportations plummet, yes.
[15:14.400 --> 15:15.400]  That's how you do it.
[15:15.400 --> 15:18.160]  That's giving services and all these rights to anybody that can get here to incentivize
[15:18.160 --> 15:19.160]  more to come here.
[15:19.160 --> 15:22.760]  We're going to be breaking all of that down as well today.
[15:22.760 --> 15:28.640]  Colorado sends non-vaccinated parents illegal order to register their children with a state
[15:28.640 --> 15:30.400]  in preparation for forced inoculation.
[15:30.400 --> 15:31.400]  That's up on infohorses.com.
[15:31.400 --> 15:35.200]  And that dovetails with infohorses.com, Pulses of Watson article.
[15:35.200 --> 15:39.240]  These orders mother's child to be sentenced because she, quote, believes in chemtrails.
[15:39.240 --> 15:41.440]  The judge actually said that.
[15:41.440 --> 15:48.440]  Well, so does Merle Haggart, Prince, Chuck Norris, and thousands of scientists that can
[15:48.440 --> 15:52.600]  read the declassified government documents that geoengineering is going on and is toxifying
[15:52.600 --> 15:53.600]  the planet.
[15:53.600 --> 15:56.600]  Even the Council on Farm Relations admits they're doing it, but says it's for a greater
[15:56.600 --> 15:57.600]  good.
[15:57.600 --> 16:02.200]  But she believes in it, and the judge says it doesn't exist, so my, my children, talk
[16:02.200 --> 16:03.200]  about cult control.
[16:03.200 --> 16:05.840]  That's what we're dealing with here.
[16:05.840 --> 16:12.560]  Now, before I go any further and get into what's happening in the economy and the election,
[16:12.560 --> 16:29.520]  the demonization of Donald Trump has now gone into total and complete absolute hyperdrive.
[16:29.520 --> 16:36.040]  And there's obviously a popular television program called Quantico that airs on one
[16:36.040 --> 16:41.320]  of the big national networks where we see all the wonderful heroes at the FBI saving
[16:41.320 --> 16:42.320]  us.
[16:42.320 --> 16:43.320]  Now, I want to be clear.
[16:43.320 --> 16:46.800]  I don't think all the FBI agents out there are evil people, but the system is evil, is
[16:46.800 --> 16:47.800]  corrupt.
[16:47.800 --> 16:50.920]  Look what Hillary Clinton's gotten away with.
[16:50.920 --> 16:57.240]  But an American militia cell now in the latest episode, the GOP presidential hopeful campaign
[16:57.240 --> 17:04.880]  slogan, Make America Great Again, is yelled before an attack in Chicago, ABC's Quantico.
[17:04.880 --> 17:08.320]  American terror cells shout, Make America Great Again, before attack.
[17:08.320 --> 17:13.120]  And the ADL has come out and said that it's Nazi to say that.
[17:13.120 --> 17:17.640]  You know, I knew this, but I looked it up this weekend.
[17:17.640 --> 17:22.400]  Dozens and dozens of countries from South Africa currently to places in Europe to China,
[17:22.400 --> 17:27.680]  they say, you know, make our country great, make it greater again, make it great again.
[17:27.680 --> 17:30.760]  Obviously you can go find some white supremacists who said sometime in history, make America
[17:30.760 --> 17:32.200]  great again or make America great.
[17:32.200 --> 17:33.200]  This is crazy.
[17:33.200 --> 17:36.520]  It's like saying Alexander the Great's name was Alexander the Great, so he's a Nazi.
[17:36.520 --> 17:40.680]  No, saying make a country, make a leader, make a culture, make a team, great again.
[17:40.680 --> 17:45.080]  I've seen the slogan, make UT great again.
[17:45.080 --> 17:51.880]  So this is an attack on language and it's so fundamental and it's so over the top where
[17:51.880 --> 17:57.120]  they just do this propaganda placement, this brainwashing, and it's everywhere.
[17:57.120 --> 18:01.760]  And they do it to yours truly all the time, where they'll even put me in mainstream fiction
[18:01.760 --> 18:08.360]  shows, a talk show hosting Alex Jones, that's a murderer, a bank robber, a child molester,
[18:08.360 --> 18:13.040]  and then people go, I saw that show where you're a, you know, a child kidnapper.
[18:13.040 --> 18:18.480]  This is how they operate and they do it on the news, Bill O'Reilly and sexual predators
[18:18.480 --> 18:19.560]  online are a major problem.
[18:19.560 --> 18:23.520]  They cut to me yelling about the police state, nothing to do with that.
[18:23.520 --> 18:25.320]  I have no criminal record.
[18:25.320 --> 18:27.560]  They just do it because they think you're dumb.
[18:27.560 --> 18:30.920]  Well, they're doing this Donald Trump big time and it shows a new level of it.
[18:30.920 --> 18:34.840]  Let's go ahead and for TV viewers, you can see it, the video's up on infowars.com, but
[18:34.840 --> 18:39.200]  let's go ahead and go to this little trailer for ABC.
[18:39.200 --> 18:42.200]  What possible reason would I have for wanting to hurt innocent people?
[18:42.200 --> 18:44.200]  Why would I want to destroy my own career?
[18:44.200 --> 18:45.720]  I don't know.
[18:45.720 --> 18:47.920]  Maybe Afghanistan broke you.
[18:47.920 --> 18:51.520]  Maybe you realize what a worthless war it was when you got back and you got to talking
[18:51.520 --> 18:54.960]  to one of the cell members one day and realize you were fighting on the wrong side.
[18:54.960 --> 18:58.720]  If you ever say something like that to me again, you're going to have a whole new set
[18:58.720 --> 18:59.720]  of problems.
[18:59.720 --> 19:00.720]  I love this country.
[19:00.720 --> 19:02.920]  Isn't that what they said when they attacked us?
[19:02.920 --> 19:03.920]  Make America great again.
[19:03.920 --> 19:04.920]  Agent Kent.
[19:04.920 --> 19:05.920]  Better back up.
[19:05.920 --> 19:11.280]  So see the terrorist attack earlier and that's in the plot they report here and then again
[19:11.280 --> 19:12.320]  they're repeating it.
[19:12.320 --> 19:13.480]  Make America great again.
[19:13.480 --> 19:17.960]  Those terrorists that didn't strike, those patriots, that said China and the communist
[19:17.960 --> 19:22.880]  Chinese were screwing us over, well now they're terror attacking and then don't you worry.
[19:22.880 --> 19:27.040]  They've got it in the hopper to provocateur, actually stage it themselves.
[19:27.040 --> 19:32.320]  Maybe like Eric Holder and his little buddies did at the Justice Department and the ATF.
[19:32.320 --> 19:36.040]  We even know the names of the FBI agents, the CIA people.
[19:36.040 --> 19:38.800]  It was in the national news what the witnesses saw.
[19:38.800 --> 19:41.800]  They were there planting the big gravesticks of butter and they told the federal workers
[19:41.800 --> 19:46.200]  never mind we're doing some phone work because we never saw phone workers look like this
[19:46.200 --> 19:48.680]  before and they identified them.
[19:48.680 --> 19:52.920]  We even know, we even found their hotel receipts, the head of the FBI hostage rescue team when
[19:52.920 --> 19:54.120]  he denied he was there.
[19:54.120 --> 19:58.800]  Oh, you were there, you even signed your own name at the hotel, didn't you buddy?
[19:58.800 --> 20:02.000]  You ought to be proud of yourself.
[20:02.000 --> 20:06.520]  How would you like to make 17% on your money in only 90 days?
[20:06.520 --> 20:07.520]  That's right.
[20:07.520 --> 20:12.000]  A lot of homeowners made 17% in only three months as gold had its best quarterly gain
[20:12.000 --> 20:13.520]  in 30 years.
[20:13.520 --> 20:18.400]  Gold is on the move and you need to get government issued legal tender gold coins starting at

[22:10.400 --> 22:12.880]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[22:12.880 --> 22:17.560]  But with a trusted big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[24:07.560 --> 24:10.560]  You know, I would call them having been playing this intro music.
[24:10.560 --> 24:37.000]  You know, I really don't care about knowing famous people because most of them are super
[24:37.000 --> 24:38.000]  boring.
[24:38.000 --> 24:41.920]  But if I admire their music or their art, then it's really cool.
[24:41.920 --> 24:47.720]  And Willie Nelson, and I've known him for more than 10 years, is a really cool guy.
[24:47.720 --> 24:48.720]  Pretty smart too.
[24:48.720 --> 24:50.680]  I'm like Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[24:50.680 --> 24:55.680]  Sank into your dreams.
[24:55.680 --> 25:00.680]  Sank into your dreams.
[25:00.680 --> 25:06.240]  Yeah, old Willie was right down the road from me.
[25:06.240 --> 25:07.240]  Good God.
[25:07.240 --> 25:08.240]  He's something years old.
[25:08.240 --> 25:22.360]  Well, for all the honest world to see, well, Pancho met his match, you know, on the deserts
[25:22.360 --> 25:24.800]  down in Mexico.
[25:24.800 --> 25:26.600]  Everybody meets their match.
[25:26.600 --> 25:35.360]  Death is the great equalizer and no one will escape, no matter how the globalists try.
[25:35.360 --> 25:41.400]  And no matter how many people claim God speaks for them, I'll tell you who God speaks for
[25:41.400 --> 25:42.400]  God.
[25:42.400 --> 25:48.720]  And if God wants to give you providence, it is a very humbling thing and shakes you to
[25:48.720 --> 25:49.720]  your core.
[25:49.720 --> 25:56.560]  If God's eyes end up actually aiming at you, you feel like an absolute total loser.
[25:56.560 --> 26:00.640]  Not an arrogant, swollen pimp like Glenn Beck.
[26:00.640 --> 26:08.840]  All right, let's go ahead and turn off that beautiful voice and let's go to this next
[26:08.840 --> 26:11.440]  clip.
[26:11.440 --> 26:16.680]  This is Glenn Beck, who attacked me a lot about me over the years, just did incredible
[26:16.680 --> 26:21.520]  misrepresentations that I just ignored and said, I'm turning the other cheek because
[26:21.520 --> 26:22.520]  it's a diversion.
[26:22.520 --> 26:23.520]  I'm not doing it.
[26:23.520 --> 26:25.400]  He needs to change and he's to stop.
[26:25.400 --> 26:27.160]  He needs to, you know, quit what he's doing.
[26:27.160 --> 26:32.800]  He's on a power trip and I just, I did that, but now he's running around saying and having
[26:32.800 --> 26:37.800]  children on stage crying with him and saying, it's his priesthood.
[26:37.800 --> 26:44.960]  And the holy man is Ted Cruz, who is running around all over national TV on all the globalist
[26:44.960 --> 26:50.960]  programs, going along with the ABC News program and the ABC TV that make America great again
[26:50.960 --> 26:51.960]  or terrorists.
[26:51.960 --> 26:52.960]  They're going to blow stuff up.
[26:52.960 --> 27:00.080]  The ABC's Quantico, American terrorist cell, shouts, make America great again before attack.
[27:00.080 --> 27:01.080]  And he's all over the TV.
[27:01.080 --> 27:02.080]  We played this yesterday.
[27:02.080 --> 27:03.080]  We can play it again.
[27:03.080 --> 27:06.680]  It's more today going, we're not a divisive nation.
[27:06.680 --> 27:11.080]  It's kind of like George W. Bush, Herbert Walker, and I tell you, it's wrong to hate
[27:11.080 --> 27:14.240]  that this man is spewing.
[27:14.240 --> 27:15.240]  It's wrong.
[27:15.240 --> 27:16.240]  I'm an immigrant myself.
[27:16.240 --> 27:18.840]  I thought you were American citizen and you could run for office.
[27:18.840 --> 27:24.920]  I mean, it's just all pandering and deception, total pandering.
[27:24.920 --> 27:26.120]  And now he's plunging in the polls.
[27:26.120 --> 27:30.320]  There's an article up on infowars.com that just went up and video of it, the tiny crowds
[27:30.320 --> 27:31.320]  he's getting.
[27:31.320 --> 27:35.520]  Just like Hillary would have crowds of 500 people and Sanders would have crowds of 50,000.
[27:35.520 --> 27:36.920]  He was winning all the first primaries.
[27:36.920 --> 27:38.680]  They just openly stole them.
[27:38.680 --> 27:43.080]  So her people went, okay, we'll go ahead and go with the winners and they went with Hillary.
[27:43.080 --> 27:45.520]  Such a cult they are.
[27:45.520 --> 27:51.720]  But now with Ted Cruz, the fact that he's come out and endorsed the Black Lives Matter,
[27:51.720 --> 27:58.880]  the social justice warriors, the Mecha, La Raza, just unintentional comedy troops waving
[27:58.880 --> 28:05.800]  Mexican flags or were hopping around, screaming and then attacking people saying, we're not
[28:05.800 --> 28:06.800]  violent.
[28:06.800 --> 28:07.800]  I shouldn't laugh.
[28:07.800 --> 28:08.800]  It's unbelievable.
[28:08.800 --> 28:09.800]  Stupid.
[28:09.800 --> 28:10.800]  But it is ridiculous.
[28:10.800 --> 28:11.800]  Makes me very sad.
[28:11.800 --> 28:12.800]  It's also funny at the same time.
[28:12.800 --> 28:13.800]  It's bittersweet.
[28:13.800 --> 28:16.800]  All this circus is going on and he comes out and attacks that.
[28:16.800 --> 28:18.000]  Trump's going way up in the polls.
[28:18.000 --> 28:25.160]  In California, everywhere else, 56% nationally in scientific polls, turbocharging 34% ahead
[28:25.160 --> 28:27.360]  in California of Cruz.
[28:27.360 --> 28:28.840]  It's crazy.
[28:28.840 --> 28:33.360]  And Glenn Beck is running around with the little hokey outfits he wears on purpose.
[28:33.360 --> 28:38.800]  I've noticed sociopaths and psychopaths always try to act wimpy and non-threatening because
[28:38.800 --> 28:41.080]  behind the scenes, they're just vicious demons.
[28:41.080 --> 28:42.840]  I know a lot of folks know Glenn Beck.
[28:42.840 --> 28:43.840]  They say he is a terror.
[28:43.840 --> 28:47.280]  I don't mean he throws a fit or gets angry sometimes.
[28:47.280 --> 28:52.640]  I mean, he is just a power tripping, thinks he's God, literally runs around just foaming
[28:52.640 --> 28:53.640]  at the mouth.
[28:53.640 --> 28:55.560]  His food is an absolutely perfect.
[28:55.560 --> 28:57.240]  He just goes into conniption fits.
[28:57.240 --> 29:00.840]  He's an arrogant sack of filth, okay?
[29:00.840 --> 29:05.000]  And he's not Christ-like, but he sits with this little wimpy with little ascots and
[29:05.000 --> 29:06.000]  little sweaters.
[29:06.000 --> 29:07.000]  Oh, hi.
[29:07.000 --> 29:08.000]  I'm not threatening.
[29:08.000 --> 29:09.000]  I'm nice.
[29:09.000 --> 29:15.400]  I'm going to say some of these clips where he's invoking God and saying, you better vote
[29:15.400 --> 29:18.800]  for Ted Cruz or you're going to go to hell, basically.
[29:18.800 --> 29:23.440]  And let me tell you something, or America's going to hell, is what he's saying.
[29:23.440 --> 29:27.720]  How many cults have we seen where they say the end of the world's next month and all
[29:27.720 --> 29:31.000]  these people sell their houses, give them to the preacher, and the preacher runs off
[29:31.000 --> 29:32.000]  with $100 million?
[29:32.000 --> 29:37.320]  That's what gives Christianity a bad name, is cult leaders like Glenn Beck.
[29:37.320 --> 29:40.120]  The guy just savers being a cult leader.
[29:40.120 --> 29:42.760]  By the way, it's destroying his media operation.
[29:42.760 --> 29:45.040]  It's imploding around him, but he can't help it.
[29:45.040 --> 29:48.880]  He's got to dance around and say he's a prophet.
[29:48.880 --> 29:49.880]  It's disgusting.
[29:49.880 --> 29:51.360]  We'll be back.
[29:51.360 --> 29:52.640]  We're on the march.
[29:52.640 --> 29:55.040]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:55.040 --> 30:18.160]  Alex Jones and the G.C.N. radio network.
[30:18.160 --> 30:33.520]  It's
[30:33.520 --> 30:38.800]  not really free. Liberty is lost through complacency and a subservient mindset when
[30:38.800 --> 30:44.880]  we accept or even welcome automobile checkpoints, random searches, mandatory identification
[30:44.880 --> 30:50.560]  cards, and paramilitary police in our streets. We have lost a vital part of our American
[30:50.560 --> 30:57.440]  heritage. America was born of protests, revolution, and mistrust of government. Subservient societies
[30:57.440 --> 31:05.680]  neither maintain nor deserve freedom for long. Thousands of years ago there was a basic form
[31:05.680 --> 31:11.680]  of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[31:11.680 --> 31:18.640]  to organize and prepare a defense. Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching
[31:18.640 --> 31:24.880]  filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens. But in the 21st century,
[31:24.880 --> 31:29.840]  there are silent weapons for quiet war. Pathogens added to the food and water,
[31:29.840 --> 31:35.520]  into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate
[31:35.520 --> 31:41.920]  our journey towards death. I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is
[31:41.920 --> 31:49.440]  designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal
[31:49.440 --> 31:54.720]  metabolic activity inside the human body. Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[31:54.720 --> 31:59.760]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com
[31:59.760 --> 32:04.880]  with Anthroplex. Hey everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many
[32:04.880 --> 32:09.360]  of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the shocking
[32:09.360 --> 32:14.800]  statistics. Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman,
[32:14.800 --> 32:19.520]  and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses
[32:19.520 --> 32:23.440]  are rampant. One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge,
[32:23.440 --> 32:27.920]  and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease. If you're dealing with a
[32:27.920 --> 32:31.120]  health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity,
[32:31.120 --> 32:35.360]  and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into
[32:35.360 --> 32:39.520]  your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients,
[32:39.520 --> 32:44.320]  the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work,
[32:44.320 --> 32:49.760]  you need to check out infowarsteam.com. Give your body the gift of good nutrition.
[32:49.760 --> 32:54.000]  Head over to infowarsteam.com. Your body will be very grateful.
[32:54.000 --> 33:20.560]  On the web at infowarsteam.com. That's infowarsteam.com.
[33:20.560 --> 33:27.360]  Evil's being let out of the pit right now. I can feel it rising, and I can also feel good rising
[33:28.000 --> 33:33.120]  the spirit of God coming back on the world as well. We are in very dangerous waters.
[33:36.640 --> 33:45.280]  And people like Donald Trump are only one manifestation of what's going on. He's obviously
[33:45.280 --> 33:51.040]  a guy, an alpha male that likes prosperity, loves this country. I think he's got a lot of worldly
[33:51.040 --> 33:57.040]  issues and problems, don't we all? The people that got a lot of good also have a lot of bad.
[33:57.600 --> 34:01.040]  Our enemies are the people that don't have hardly any good, but have a bunch of bad.
[34:02.960 --> 34:07.840]  And I don't enjoy getting up here and attacking people like Glenn Beck. Let's get that straight.
[34:07.840 --> 34:15.680]  But when I see manifests, smoking evil, the guy's on fire with sniveling evil.
[34:16.320 --> 34:20.160]  To the spiritual level I can see him, and I can see all of his fruits, and it's just
[34:20.800 --> 34:28.240]  a prancing demon, a nely, feminine, con artist,
[34:30.240 --> 34:33.680]  praying on people that makes me want to throw up, and I'll just be honest with you.
[34:33.680 --> 34:39.040]  And I love Christ, and I have a relationship with God, and I know that there's a spiritual
[34:39.040 --> 34:43.600]  battle going on. I know my best works like dirty rags, and I do have the Holy Spirit.
[34:43.600 --> 34:50.080]  I feel God constantly. It's very humbling. And as the evil intensifies, I get more discernment,
[34:50.080 --> 34:54.080]  more focus, more intelligence that God gives me. That's what the Bible says it'll do.
[34:54.080 --> 34:59.120]  And I am constantly almost in tears because I can feel the presence of God,
[34:59.120 --> 35:06.640]  and I know how worldly I am, and it's like being naked and ashamed. And I see all these proud,
[35:06.640 --> 35:13.600]  evil men, they will fall, they will be broken. And I'm not sure what's coming in the future,
[35:13.600 --> 35:18.480]  but everybody feels it, everybody sees it. All I can tell you is everybody better get right with
[35:18.480 --> 35:23.360]  God. And all these people out there that think this is funny, you're not going to think it's funny
[35:23.360 --> 35:31.280]  very soon. We have been insulated in this country because of our ancestors who weren't perfect,
[35:31.280 --> 35:36.480]  but they were the best there were from every corner of the world. We were the new world.
[35:39.360 --> 35:43.120]  But we were the most inventive, and the most freedom ever allowed did happen here
[35:43.120 --> 35:48.240]  for a short time. So great wealth and blessing was brought to us because
[35:48.240 --> 35:56.320]  it was of the free thinkers that set up this country. And now we've been turned into an engine
[35:56.320 --> 36:05.360]  of abomination. And all I ask is God to spare my children. And
[36:13.680 --> 36:16.480]  I mean, we live in a country where they kill babies and sell their body parts,
[36:16.480 --> 36:19.680]  and where they do put chemicals in the water to brain damage you and your family
[36:19.680 --> 36:22.960]  and cause infertility. That's just the start. Do you understand? We live in a country with
[36:22.960 --> 36:27.040]  thousands of aircraft flying around spraying poison on us, and mothers that talk about it
[36:27.040 --> 36:30.640]  get arrested and have their kids taken in Colorado. It's going to get a lot worse, folks.
[36:30.640 --> 36:35.440]  They're coming for everybody. Do you understand that? And what's sad is they want to force you
[36:35.440 --> 36:41.440]  to submit to their evil because they want your soul. They want your will. They want you to willingly
[36:41.440 --> 36:46.240]  turn yourself over to it. And that's how a coward dies a thousand deaths. They convince
[36:46.240 --> 36:50.720]  themselves that the evil is good and lie to themselves and accept the evil as if it's not
[36:50.720 --> 36:57.280]  bad because they're so scared of the truth deep down. They decide to have a great delusion.
[36:57.280 --> 36:59.040]  They decide to become mentally ill,
[37:04.240 --> 37:10.560]  and they decide to believe that the evil is good and that the good is evil. I mean,
[37:10.560 --> 37:18.880]  Glenn Beck famously let them put chemicals in his eyes. What was it for an Esquire cover story?
[37:20.320 --> 37:25.920]  Was it Esquire or was it? Yeah, it was Esquire. You look it up. Just type Glenn Beck crying.
[37:26.880 --> 37:30.880]  And he joked about it on video knowing it would go out that he was fake.
[37:33.200 --> 37:38.480]  To let the system know I'm fake. I'm a fraud. I'll let the liberals know I'm a fraud and make
[37:38.480 --> 37:43.200]  fun of conservatives and patriots and Christians, but my own audience wants to believe in me so
[37:43.200 --> 37:53.840]  they won't see it. Signaling that I'm a traitor. I'm a piece of filth. Promote me. I'll lead these
[37:53.840 --> 38:03.440]  people down a rat hole. And he was so dishonorable and so rat like even news corps threw him out,
[38:03.440 --> 38:06.800]  not wanting to be around something like that. Because even though news corps corrupt, there's
[38:06.800 --> 38:10.880]  a problem still. Powerful men still want to be around honor. Even though they hate it,
[38:10.880 --> 38:15.920]  they sold out. They're guilty and they hate it. Believe me, I know them. But this little son
[38:15.920 --> 38:21.840]  of a bitch loves it. Excuse me, God. He loves betraying people. He gets off on it. He's committed
[38:21.840 --> 38:28.720]  to Satan. I hate that guy right there. He says I'm scary. He bet I'm scary, buddy.
[38:28.720 --> 38:35.040]  Because I'm only one billionth of what you're going to face at the white throne judgment.
[38:38.480 --> 38:44.080]  The dishonor of these people is so manifest. I just want to get away from them. I can't look
[38:44.080 --> 38:52.240]  at them anymore. It's how they enjoy lying to people. They enjoy dishonor. I just even tuning
[38:52.240 --> 39:01.360]  into their spirit, even picking up on how they are, empathizing. It's just, it's horrible. It's
[39:01.360 --> 39:11.520]  horrible. These are predators against their own species. And I don't hate them. It's a feeling
[39:11.520 --> 39:15.520]  in the last few years I've never had before. It's beyond that. I want to be apart from them.
[39:16.720 --> 39:21.040]  I want to be in another dimension for them. I want them to go be with their own kind.
[39:21.040 --> 39:27.680]  They call that place hell. And to be there forever, away from me and my family and other kindred spirits
[39:28.400 --> 39:32.480]  that want to be with God, it's that simple. It's a choice these people make. They make their own
[39:32.480 --> 39:36.800]  hell. They make, and I don't want to get religious here folks or spiritual, but the point is I sit
[39:36.800 --> 39:42.800]  there and I look at these abominations, these demonic creatures. They almost see a tail and
[39:42.800 --> 39:56.800]  horns on that guy. I mean, he is so frickin' evil. Oh, God. I mean, I have to control myself
[39:56.800 --> 40:00.000]  constantly not to cry on air. I never, each cry maybe once over two or three years on air when
[40:00.000 --> 40:04.160]  I talk about family or some story. I saw some story about bass and hounds with this baby that's
[40:04.160 --> 40:09.440]  brain dead. But I had to realize I said, I can't cover that story on air before I went on air
[40:09.440 --> 40:16.400]  because I'll start crying because of the humanity that's gone from us, but these dogs have this
[40:16.400 --> 40:20.640]  love, this commitment. It's everything in the universe. And these sociopaths and psychopaths
[40:20.640 --> 40:25.040]  think a dog loving a brain dead child that loved what it wasn't brain dead from a stroke.
[40:26.480 --> 40:33.440]  They think it's weakness in the dog. No, you're the weak people, you sociopaths and psychopaths.
[40:33.440 --> 40:40.480]  You're the people that never scale the heights of love and honor. They never have the dreams.
[40:41.040 --> 40:45.920]  You don't care about other people, your fools. And you prance around and claim that you care about
[40:45.920 --> 40:52.160]  other people when you hate them and want to dominate them and see them hurt because it makes
[40:52.160 --> 41:01.520]  you feel bigger. I don't need to pray against going back or even cursing. You cursed yourself.
[41:01.520 --> 41:06.240]  I know you must have had a horrible childhood. You claim you did, but it's all lies and suicide
[41:06.240 --> 41:14.240]  parents, all this darkness, but probably real. You're a creation of this planet and you're just
[41:14.240 --> 41:23.040]  more pathetic, scared wreckage. And in your own delusion, you really think when you're in that
[41:23.040 --> 41:34.960]  fantasy land that you are a soldier of Christ, your delusion is so great. But that's only a
[41:34.960 --> 41:41.680]  garment you put on in your heart. You know who you are when the lights go off. And I see you,
[41:41.680 --> 41:47.760]  Glenn Beckett, Ted Cruz. And I'm ashamed that my gut told me Ted Cruz was an evil robot,
[41:47.760 --> 41:55.920]  but I still just hoped and dreamed and was lied to. But I'm done ranting about you.
[41:56.960 --> 41:59.760]  I want to go to this clip and then I'll get to the other news. Let's go ahead and
[42:00.960 --> 42:05.040]  your TV viewer, radio listeners, theclipsuponemforce.com will play it now. Let's go from right wing
[42:05.040 --> 42:08.880]  watch, the establishment that got this to make fun of Christians and discredit us,
[42:08.880 --> 42:14.000]  White House run, putting this out again with their own operative to discredit the Liberty
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.960]  Movement. Here he is.
[42:44.960 --> 42:53.840]  Before I walked out on stage, Ted and I got down on our knees and we prayed and we didn't pray,
[42:54.560 --> 43:04.160]  we didn't pray for us. We prayed for the nation and for you. He is a servant at heart.
[43:05.200 --> 43:11.600]  He is a man who is raised for these times. People don't believe that stuff anymore,
[43:11.600 --> 43:18.560]  but I do. If God raised George Washington and Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Bain,
[43:18.560 --> 43:22.320]  if he put that collection down there, Trump was a servant raised up by the devil.
[43:22.880 --> 43:24.240]  I know a servant when I see one.
[43:27.600 --> 43:30.400]  And at first our computer was playing it fast. That wasn't on purpose.
[43:30.400 --> 43:32.080]  We're trying to make him sound like a chipmunk for 10 seconds.
[43:33.280 --> 43:36.240]  I don't mean to get emotional watching that. It's just that
[43:36.240 --> 43:40.960]  I think the jury's partially out on Donald Trump.
[43:43.040 --> 43:45.680]  My gut tells me he's for real, but he can be manipulated.
[43:46.960 --> 43:50.640]  But the reason they hate him is they know he's his own person, a nationalist,
[43:50.640 --> 43:54.880]  it doesn't like us having bad deals. And then he thinks he can save America for his big ego and
[43:54.880 --> 43:59.840]  his own family. Well, you know, that's natural and normal. But Glenn Beck, I know Glenn Beck far
[43:59.840 --> 44:05.280]  too well. And when you've got ABC TV, Shane, make America great again is what militias do when they
[44:05.280 --> 44:10.240]  blow up schools just made up. And you've got the whole media and all these criminal grips and all
[44:10.240 --> 44:19.600]  these Ford Foundation groups targeting Donald Trump and myself and everybody else and trying
[44:19.600 --> 44:24.960]  to sell this big lie that we're racist and we're horrible. Because we've got to have some border
[44:24.960 --> 44:31.120]  and some fair trade deals. It's crazy. It's an attempt to defeat logic and to bring in an age
[44:31.120 --> 44:40.240]  of total insanity. And, you know, I've got Ted Cruz clips here saying he's hoping on a miracle.
[44:40.240 --> 44:43.280]  He seeks divine intervention in Indiana.
[44:48.800 --> 44:55.040]  Forget Donald Trump. It's the battle of nationalism versus these globalists. And look at the company
[44:55.040 --> 45:02.240]  Glenn Beck keeps previous and the Republican leadership and the Democrats and George Will
[45:02.240 --> 45:08.480]  in the Washington Post saying, we decide we are sovereign. Your vote doesn't count as an individual.
[45:08.480 --> 45:11.600]  We need to suspend it and give it to Hillary. I mean, that's what he said. I read the quote like
[45:12.240 --> 45:14.640]  seven times yesterday. In fact, well, somebody run that end if you have it.
[45:16.960 --> 45:21.040]  Hey, listen, that was never any voting. We're sovereign. We run the country. We're the party.
[45:21.040 --> 45:26.000]  Sit out and shut up. Here's Glenn Beck. He says that, you know, it's good against evil and the
[45:26.000 --> 45:32.080]  devil's raised up a serpent over here. We know the devil's raised up Hillary Clinton who you're
[45:32.080 --> 45:38.560]  saying we should go for Glenn Beck over Donald Trump. Give me a break. We know she's a bona fide
[45:38.560 --> 45:47.760]  witch, literal devil worshipper. And you sit there and you point your finger at Donald Trump
[45:47.760 --> 45:56.000]  and say he's the devil. I'm going to stop. I got to get off him. Let's just get off. He's too
[45:56.000 --> 45:59.440]  evil. I can't. I don't even look at him because he's so evil. Just kidding. I can't look at him.
[45:59.440 --> 46:07.520]  It's like Obama. God help me. And notice he's on a suicide mission against liberty.
[46:08.880 --> 46:12.240]  That matter. He loses 60% of his audience and everything in the stations he's on,
[46:12.240 --> 46:16.640]  truck on bankrupt and everything else. He doesn't care. He's got to stop Donald Trump.
[46:16.640 --> 46:22.400]  He's got to stop the nationalists. He's got to stop the patriots. They've had the Pentagon
[46:22.400 --> 46:26.880]  and the State Department come back out again and say that Obama never said that there wouldn't
[46:26.880 --> 46:32.480]  be boots on the ground in Syria. He almost said it 16 times on video. And then now they've come out
[46:32.480 --> 46:37.680]  and said that there's no al-Qaeda, you know, in al-Nusra or ISIS. And now they go, no, actually,
[46:37.680 --> 46:44.640]  it is there and it's better. It's there because we like them. You can't fool an honest man. You
[46:44.640 --> 46:49.120]  can't con an honest man. That's one of the best sayings ever. My late uncle always said that,
[46:49.120 --> 46:53.360]  Buckley's dad. Because our brains just don't work like yours.
[46:55.200 --> 47:00.160]  All this mentally ill con artist bull just sticks right out. You people are a joke.
[47:00.160 --> 47:06.480]  You think it's smart. You can lie and twist. That's not smart. That's dumb. You're lying to
[47:06.480 --> 47:14.480]  yourselves. I'm going to stop. I'm going to go a bunch of clips and come back from break. Briefly, we
[47:14.480 --> 47:19.840]  fund this operation and we're under attack and everybody knows that demonization and black ops
[47:19.840 --> 47:26.400]  and dirty tricks. And I love it because I know it means we're over the target, but it's good to be
[47:26.400 --> 47:30.320]  able to provision ourselves in this fight and to have a C wall against the enemy. We really don't
[47:30.320 --> 47:34.560]  really have that C wall that we're doing okay. We've able to have the people we have. I'd like
[47:34.560 --> 47:39.280]  to hire some more folks. We're trying that right now and just hoping the funding comes through.
[47:39.840 --> 47:43.120]  We have the best products, the best water filters, whatever the best stuff is, the best
[47:43.120 --> 47:46.160]  we are. I go out and make a good deal and get it. The best selection of non-GMO,
[47:46.160 --> 47:50.720]  heirloom seeds you name it. All survival items are 10% off through the week.
[47:51.920 --> 47:56.800]  And I'm just extending this and twisting arms. I don't know how long I can do it, but 30-40%
[47:56.800 --> 48:02.160]  off on the MyPatreon supply foods, the entire family of their foods, freshest newest foods,
[48:02.160 --> 48:09.200]  private labeled as M4 Select and M4Store.com or M4Select.com and it's all there. 30-40%
[48:09.200 --> 48:13.440]  off the already really low prices that MyPatreon has. Good, clean, wholesome, high-quality food
[48:13.440 --> 48:17.440]  that I've chosen for my family. Great shelf life, the best containers, the best packaging.
[48:18.720 --> 48:23.440]  Everything from 72-hour bug out kits to one-year interior supplies. And I'm storing up a lot more
[48:23.440 --> 48:27.280]  in our office and medical supplies and everything else. The government's doing it. They call us
[48:27.280 --> 48:31.280]  Cougs when we do it and we're does whatever. That didn't work anymore. Media's got 6% trust rate.
[48:31.280 --> 48:35.360]  Congress has got a 9% approval rating. Go ahead and say I'm evil all day. That's my certification.
[48:35.360 --> 48:40.000]  He's a good guy. But I hope we never need to use this, but I think people that have the
[48:40.000 --> 48:44.880]  means especially should try to provision for people around you and what's happening because
[48:44.880 --> 48:49.600]  everything the globalists do is about making us dependent on them. Everything they do is about
[48:49.600 --> 48:56.080]  making us not able to support ourselves. And just the last six months, my gut told me I saw the signs
[48:56.080 --> 49:01.280]  and I, again, there's tornadoes in town and I go get in the basement. It doesn't hit my house. I'm
[49:01.280 --> 49:05.360]  not a cook. It's great. I got in the basement and unfortunately it tears up houses five miles away.
[49:05.360 --> 49:09.200]  But if tornadoes are coming my way, I get in the basement or I get in the bathroom if I don't have
[49:09.200 --> 49:13.680]  a basement. And houses that don't have a basement. I grew up in Dallas seeing tornadoes every year.
[49:13.680 --> 49:19.360]  We live on a hill over a lake and I'd see them 10 miles away gray, you know, over the farmland
[49:19.360 --> 49:23.840]  and then hitting the city and turning, you know, the color of houses white gray and then going out
[49:23.840 --> 49:30.320]  in the lake and turning blue, water spouts. My dad say, hey, they could form here. Let's go. Let's go
[49:30.320 --> 49:35.920]  get in the basement. That place had a little storage deal under the house in a crawl space.
[49:35.920 --> 49:39.360]  We called the basement. He had expanded in there and we go get in there. Not we were cowards. We
[49:39.360 --> 49:43.040]  weren't fearful. We were just, you know, there's tornadoes popping up everywhere in Dallas. We're
[49:43.040 --> 49:47.120]  going to go get in the, we're going to go get in the basement. And that's what I'm saying is you
[49:47.120 --> 49:52.320]  see that food there, the firearms, the medical supplies, an emergency plan. If a nuke goes off
[49:52.320 --> 49:56.240]  or we start World War three with the Russians, folks, you're not going to get your kids out of
[49:56.240 --> 50:00.240]  school. That happens. I mean, you got to be watching every day. You got to be ready. The
[50:00.240 --> 50:04.160]  globalists are digging in. They're going into bunkers. I don't know what's going on. There's
[50:04.160 --> 50:08.080]  a lot of threat levels, but I'm telling you, you need to get ready. And number one, get your gut
[50:08.080 --> 50:16.480]  right with God. So mega food sales is extending it with twisted arms, 34% off info wars life.com

[53:04.160 --> 53:08.880]  proteins that make up the way lose their original shapes. They fold in on themselves and lose their
[53:08.880 --> 53:13.120]  functional value. One World Way undergoes a technological enhancement that we believe
[53:13.120 --> 53:17.840]  restores these potent proteins back to their original shapes the body can use. I chose to
[53:17.840 --> 53:23.600]  try One World Way first before going to a doctor who would likely only prescribe drugs.
[53:23.600 --> 53:31.280]  To my delight it worked after stabbing pain for years to have it completely gone as a miracle.
[53:31.280 --> 53:36.480]  I'd like to also stress that for me it took several months of taking One World Way before
[53:36.480 --> 53:43.040]  I had improvement and then an entire year for my gut to feel 100% healed. So now I tell my friends
[53:43.040 --> 53:53.120]  give your body time to make use of the healing power of One World Way. Call 888-988-3325 or visit

[54:10.480 --> 54:16.960]  In the interest of time I'm not going to play the clip from a week ago where the very same state
[54:16.960 --> 54:24.320]  department weaseled. It's up and says we never said we wouldn't have boots on the ground in Syria.
[54:24.320 --> 54:29.200]  That's ridiculous. It starts laughing at everyone and they're sitting over their mouths hanging open
[54:29.200 --> 54:33.280]  and even the propaganda channel USA Today had to put 16 clips together. We played part of it.
[54:33.280 --> 54:36.160]  I'm not going to play the whole thing of Obama pledging. I will never do it.
[54:38.160 --> 54:42.640]  It's come out again and said people are lying. It didn't happen. I'm not going to play it. You
[54:42.640 --> 54:48.400]  know what happened or you can look it up. No one buys this. You people have a 6% trust rate. I mean
[54:48.400 --> 54:55.200]  police. To where they have comedians at the White House press dinner and Obama got so mad
[54:55.200 --> 54:59.440]  pointing right at him saying you're basically a murdering piece of trash and Wolf Blitzer you're
[54:59.440 --> 55:04.720]  a total fraud. Why would somebody have the courage to do that? The guy's got it sold. The guy's got
[55:04.720 --> 55:09.120]  courage. What's the comedian's name? I'm a new hero. But right in the den of vipers. You can tell
[55:09.120 --> 55:12.880]  he didn't like him through the body language. He was sick. He was scared doing it, but he did it
[55:12.880 --> 55:17.760]  and manned up, which is a real man right there. Body language was perfect. That guy could really
[55:17.760 --> 55:21.600]  see. He didn't like it. He could feel the evil. He did the right thing because he knows they're
[55:21.600 --> 55:27.520]  done. Now's the time to blow the rotting barn down. Now's the time to bury this political system of
[55:27.520 --> 55:34.400]  the devil and believe me folks. Pardon me. Oh yeah, Larry Wilmore. There will pop in there. No,
[55:34.400 --> 55:39.040]  I've got his name right here. Yeah, we can, we can go over all this. They remind me to go to the
[55:39.040 --> 55:44.000]  club. This is State Department clowns caught in a lie. Once again, this time by the Defense
[55:44.000 --> 55:49.760]  Department. Oh, you're talking about the name of the comedian. What's the name again? Larry Wilmore.
[55:49.760 --> 55:53.840]  I want to get him on. I love him. State Department clowns caught in a lie. Once again, this time
[55:53.840 --> 55:58.960]  by the Defense Department, Colonel Steve Warren, Operation Inherent Resolve spokesman,
[55:58.960 --> 56:05.360]  DOD briefing with Baghdad on April 20th stated that Al-Nuzra, that's Al-Qaeda in the primary group
[56:05.360 --> 56:10.400]  that is occupying Aleppo, the key city in Syria, the crossroads. On April 27th, State Department
[56:10.400 --> 56:15.840]  Deputy Mark Toner went on saying that Al-Nuzra is not holding Aleppo, which they are. On May 28th,
[56:15.840 --> 56:19.760]  State Department Representative Kirby, this is the one we're going to play, said that Al-Qaeda
[56:19.760 --> 56:25.760]  control of Aleppo is better option than Syria Army liberating from international recognized
[56:25.760 --> 56:32.080]  terrorists who committed 9-11 reportedly. That's my second show. I mean, whoa, they're admitting
[56:32.080 --> 56:36.240]  they're backing Al-Qaeda, but first lying, first admitting it, the military telling the truth,
[56:36.240 --> 56:39.680]  saying it's a problem, then denying it, then coming and saying, okay, we did lie,
[56:39.680 --> 56:45.040]  but it's better for you. Whoa, whopper, whopper, whopper. And I'll say it's the army
[56:45.840 --> 56:50.000]  that's basically telling the truth. I'm not lionizing the army, but the army has decided to
[56:50.000 --> 56:54.960]  look. We're not backing Al-Qaeda. No, we know you did it. We know criminals took the contrary. We're
[56:54.960 --> 56:59.440]  lining up against you. I've had the top experts on the insiders who launched the whole operation
[56:59.440 --> 57:02.800]  against the globalist. People are getting killed by the scenes. Just know that. Let's go to the club.
[57:04.560 --> 57:10.160]  Not under the exclusive control of Nuzra. And there is the perception, and certainly this is
[57:10.160 --> 57:18.240]  something that the Syrian regime and the Russians have supported, that Aleppo is under Nuzra control.
[57:18.240 --> 57:23.040]  Therefore, they can simply attack it, and they're going after unknown terrorist organizations.
[57:23.040 --> 57:28.160]  It's primarily Al-Nuzra who holds Aleppo. And of course, Al-Nuzra is not part of the
[57:28.160 --> 57:37.440]  cessation of hostilities. You know, the expansion of Assad regime control inside Syria is not a good
[57:37.440 --> 57:40.160]  thing for the people of Syria writ large. That's an Al-Qaeda backer right there.
[57:41.920 --> 57:49.600]  You know, talks about this liberation, if you will, of Aleppo, or it's a falsehood.
[57:49.600 --> 57:54.960]  Colonel Warren said a couple of days ago when he was talking about Aleppo, he said that Aleppo is
[57:54.960 --> 58:00.640]  primarily in the hands of Al-Nuzra. Is that a view here? Well, I think, again, Mark talked to this.
[58:00.640 --> 58:04.640]  I mean, our view of Aleppo is that it's a very mixed, very fluid environment,
[58:04.640 --> 58:11.440]  and that the groups are intermingled, and that's our view of it. It's primarily Al-Nuzra who holds
[58:11.440 --> 58:17.840]  Aleppo. And of course, Al-Nuzra is not part of the cessation of hostilities. So the army goes,
[58:17.840 --> 58:21.680]  they're breaking the ceasefire. It's Al-Nuzra Al-Qaeda. They're bad. We need to take them out.
[58:21.680 --> 58:25.200]  And you got the State Department running around saying, no, that's not happening.
[58:25.920 --> 58:30.560]  These are traitors, folks. They need to be arrested. I'll tell you right now, the guy needs a trial,
[58:31.200 --> 58:35.200]  and they all need to get marched up there and get robes put around their neck. Those Al-Qaeda people
[58:35.200 --> 58:40.960]  have killed over 200,000 Christians in Syria in a war they started. My God, we're run by evil people,
[58:40.960 --> 58:45.680]  and they're bringing them in with sleeper cells to hit this country. I will not put up with this
[58:45.680 --> 58:48.560]  anymore. That son of a bitch went back, excuse me.
[58:51.600 --> 58:57.920]  Brain Force, it's a completely different cryobottle of it. Rob Doe joins us. You worked, I guess,
[58:57.920 --> 59:02.960]  like 20 plus hours. Tell us what Brain Force did. I'd been working all day. I took a couple hours off
[59:02.960 --> 59:08.400]  coaching basketball. I get in here at 8.30. I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel
[59:08.400 --> 59:12.240]  like I was going to make it. And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle
[59:12.240 --> 59:16.800]  of Brain Force right there. I popped two of them, and about 20 minutes later, it's like, everything
[59:16.800 --> 59:22.160]  just kind of clears up. It's got four and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find
[59:22.160 --> 59:27.200]  out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise, because it really does have
[59:27.200 --> 59:32.000]  the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off. I haven't pulled an all-nighter
[59:32.000 --> 59:35.600]  like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force. I went home
[59:35.600 --> 59:41.280]  about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[59:41.280 --> 59:50.080]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[59:50.080 --> 01:00:18.560]  The World is a dangerous place, not because of evil,
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:25.440]  but because of those who look on and do nothing. If you are receiving this transmission,
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:51.920]  you are the resistance. We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center. It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:05.520]  You know, I'm really glad that Daria this morning said, have you seen this clip?
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:10.800]  And I've read about how the Pentagon and the Army particularly keeps
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:14.960]  saying, no, al-Nusra is al-Qaeda. That's admitted and they're taking over everything and
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.440]  we're giving them weapons and we're not going to be part of this. We're not going to back them.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:23.440]  That's the four years of the military behind the scenes refusing to do it and then giving Russians
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:29.200]  to go after them. Total rebellion against the people that hijacked the country because
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:33.840]  rebellion against a hijacker is your duty because they're not the captain. They're not the lawful
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:40.320]  government. And I've told you with Colonel Shaffer and Dr. Steve Pacinac and countless others years
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:46.480]  ago, the epic battle with the U.S. Army particularly. And boy, the U.S. Army's done the dirty work,
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:53.440]  folks. It's one of the most highest kill count out there. I mean, when it comes to,
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:02:00.000]  but sometimes it's like a saw on the road to Damascus.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:09.680]  The Army has come out in the last four years behind the scenes. We told you it was happening,
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:13.280]  but now publicly after Benghazi and the rest of it said, look, we're not giving weapons to al-Qaeda
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:17.440]  and ISIS. We're not going to murder Christians. We're not doing this. You people are crazy and
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:22.800]  Saudi Arabia is crazy. What we've done to Iraq was wrong and we apologize for it and you better
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:27.600]  stop it. And the chairman of the Joint Chiefs went and told Obama three years ago, he said,
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.560]  we're not doing this air raid. We're not going to back al-Qaeda. Then Rand Paul came out and said,
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:36.640]  we're not al-Qaeda's air force. Cruz jumped on the bandwagon, did some good things, talked about it,
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:42.160]  but only because it was already out. And now they keep trying to turn the country over to al-Nusra.
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:46.240]  That's the main group that is al-Qaeda. That's just their name in Syria. It's admitted that that's
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:54.560]  not debatable. And so we have this incredibly sensational club that I just played that just is
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:03:01.680]  so amazing where State Department deceiver caught in the lie once again this time of the Defense
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:08.880]  Department. Well, it's not caught in the lie. They all know the players. The military, particularly
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:16.320]  the army, is refusing to lie just like they did on 9-11 leaking the info to Congress who was really
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:22.880]  involved, 28 pages. See, they put the word out. We helped them. We got the word out. Others did.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:28.480]  Now it's known and people across the board are, look at this Colonel Warren. I'm sure he's not
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:32.720]  perfect. Nobody is, but he's not going to back al-Qaeda, murdering hundreds of thousands of people.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:38.720]  He won't do it. Look at his face. He's a good guy. You can see he's good, but his actions prove it.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:42.880]  This isn't a hard choice. We're not going to back al-Qaeda. We're not going to sell baby parts.
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:50.400]  We're not going to put floor on the water. We're done. You understand that? I'm not afraid of the
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:54.560]  New World Order. I'm afraid of joining something like this and my soul being destroyed. You know,
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:58.800]  I don't believe in God. Just have fun doing whatever you want. I can feel it, folks. Okay,
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:03.600]  I don't need to be charged on these issues. I know it. Thank God I'm not with you people.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:09.920]  I'm not perfect, but let me tell you, I do not choose to hurt innocent people and to be an
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:15.280]  evil son of a piece of garbage. I apologize. I used a little deprecating language. It's nothing
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:20.160]  wrong if you're a kid from a single parent saying somebody's an SOB. It's not a good enough term
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:25.040]  for somebody like Obama or the New World Order or al-Qaeda, but I, that really comes out because
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:28.960]  I just want to, I just, that's the words that come out of me and I'm trying to control myself.
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:33.360]  I've been on there 21 years and not ever used words like that hardly so lately because I'm so
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:41.280]  upset and I apologize. But I mean, I just, I've got such resolve. It's beyond confidence when it
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:46.240]  comes to these people. I just metaphysically want to tear their arms and legs out of their sockets.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:51.760]  I mean, I just, these people are low. They're weak. They're stupid. They're wicked. And it's time for
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:05:00.000]  the sleeping giant that is free humanity to rise in an information war and defeat the occupiers.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:11.360]  As the Republican primary sees and winds down, there is one true frontrunner. Like it or not,
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:16.720]  Donald Trump has a commanding lead, but he's still being followed, although distantly,
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:23.520]  by Ted Cruz and John Kasich. Join us Tuesday, 7 o'clock PM Central for live coverage of the

[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:35.360]  they are so alone they think they're so smart because they're ruling their little sub dimension
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:41.360]  they're not even really in the real universe or in their fantasy land
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:57.280]  they never get their mojo rising imagine that all right I want to go back I want to go to
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:02.480]  some cruise clips here in a minute but I want to play this clip that I mentioned you got ABC's
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:07.520]  Quantico American terror cell shouts make America great again before they blow a bunch of Americans
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:11.520]  up so Trump's going to bomb you now that's the people watch that believe it down with Trump he
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:16.160]  wants to blow us up that's up on info wars dot com from right Bart up on drugs report dot com
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:22.080]  you got this priesthood rising uh cruise running around saying divine intervention save us
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:28.320]  please save us from Trump oh it's so horrible oh it's so terrible uh anything but Trump just
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:31.760]  the whole establishment against Trump boy what is it about Trump they don't like
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:37.280]  I'll say this if Trump gets in he is about guys the greatest deception I've ever seen
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:43.280]  the globalists don't like to get out of control like this they want to control it this is real
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:50.960]  they don't like Trump that's real but is it because he won't kiss their rear ends
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:56.160]  see I don't want Trump if that's just what it is and he's not going through the regular channels
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:04.560]  but I'm hoping it's something else but regardless it's about defeating populism
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.320]  and it's about this crediting populism and nationalism that's why I'm supporting Trump
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.680]  I'm supporting Trump so if he goes sideways on us or goes in reverse
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.800]  I've got credibility and I've been focused on it to really go after Trump and that's something
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:25.360]  else it's done just let you know where I come from but the big clip I want to play here in just a
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:34.400]  moment and and then we'll play the ABC quantico is state department clowns uh that is ringwraiths
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:38.640]  caught in a lie once again this time of the defense department this is one of the most epic clips ever
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:41.920]  I never played clips two or three times in a row but here it is played at last hour
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:51.040]  colonel steve warren a patriot operation inherent resolved spokesman dod briefing from bag daddy
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:56.400]  April 20th stated that al-Nuzra is the primary group that is occupying lepo on April 27th said
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:02.000]  department deputy mark toner went on saying that al-Nuzra is not holding a lepo on by 28th said
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:08.480]  department rep Kirby the worst ever said that al-Qaeda control of a lepo is better than syrian
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:13.840]  army liberating it from internationally recognized terrorists who were involved in 911 bare minimum
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:22.880]  a second that's today for yesterday may 3rd today what an epic I mean this this video I talk about
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:27.120]  skeleton keys or rosetta stones or philosopher stones you can decode stuff with
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:35.360]  this is so big because believe me it's been in the news everywhere that they have gone over the
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:40.320]  army over the navy over the marine corps over the air force but the army really is the biggest force
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:46.400]  on the ground so that's who's doing all this and they're saying listen stop saying al-Qaeda is in
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:50.240]  syria stop saying that al-Nuzra is al-Qaeda stop saying isis al-Qaeda when they all have the same
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:54.720]  flag they change the name to confuse everybody we're in a court martial you and the whole army
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:58.880]  basically said you know what go ahead and do that we're not backing al-Qaeda we're not their air force
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:02.960]  we're not going to cut people's heads off this all started four or five years ago when adam and
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:08.560]  gazi they would ship the arms up to syria and us special forces would offload when the c-130s landed
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:15.920]  to people in the deck of cards from al-Qaeda they were like there were army colonels going what in
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:21.760]  the earth and these guys would these these these jihadis are so arrogant they're not controlled

[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:12.480]  feeling of freedom isn't it because we don't become men until we're committed all the way
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:17.680]  to realize there is no future unless we put it 110 against these people

[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:43.840]  families he sits up there giggling and laughing about it because he thinks he's powerful because
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:51.760]  he's allied with evil god is going to crush you i don't take any pleasure in that i don't like seeing
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:58.560]  god step on a pile of horse crap let's go to clip lepo is not under the exclusive control of nusra
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:05.520]  and there is the perception and certainly this is something that the syrian regime and the russians
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:11.600]  have uh have supported that a lepo is under nusra control therefore they can simply attack it and
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:16.880]  they're going after uh unknown terrorist organizations it's primarily al-nusra who holds a lepo that's
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:24.640]  the army and of course al-nusra not part of the cessation of hostilities you know the expansion
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:30.560]  of Assad regime control inside syria is not a good thing for the people of syria at large
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:40.560]  uh and so uh you know talks about this liberation if you will uh of a lepo or it's a it's a false
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:45.840]  suit hurtle warren said a couple of days ago when he was talking about a lepo he said that
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:51.360]  a lepo is primarily in the hands of onusra is that is that a view you're well i think again
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:56.160]  mark talked to this i mean our our view of a lepo is that it's a very mixed very fluid environment
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:01.440]  and that the and the groups are are intermingled and that that's that's our view of it so yeah
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:07.200]  it's primarily al-nusra who holds a lepo uh and of course al-nusra not part of the cessation of
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:15.520]  hostilities they're running al-qaeda takeover of syria they change the name confuse everybody the
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:20.000]  army comes out and tells the truth everybody's like oh look the army exposed to light no the army
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:26.560]  is directly contravening the foreigners the the vc french if you will that have i mean we are
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:34.080]  literally occupied by globalists you understand it's not rhetoric people that are allied with al-qaeda
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:38.560]  saudi arabia bringing in millions of people in europe the united states and other areas
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:45.200]  and sleeper cells giving them weapons and when they attack they will take all of our rights or arrest
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:52.320]  us claiming we made them attack because we wouldn't put hoods on our wives heads i mean these are the

[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:23.280]  is clear iodine is key is paramount and there's still so much new information coming out that we
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:29.680]  simply can't even keep up with it in our quest for the purest iodine we drill down more than 7000

[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:27.840]  i've been pretty not not emotional today but it i'm somebody that's a realist
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:33.280]  and i look at all the genetic engineering and i look at all the bizarre behavior going on and i
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:38.080]  look at all the wars being started i look at our government hijacked by foreign interest backing the
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:45.920]  most horrible evil people doing just despicable evil things in mass and i study the elite and i go
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:52.560]  these people are best described as demons i don't know if demons are real but they're real because
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:35:02.800]  you're a demon and then my gut sense is it's accelerating it's getting worse it's building up
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:09.600]  and my gut's never been wrong my whole life i mean uh i almost always follow my gut now
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:13.760]  i used to i didn't follow it all as i get older i just say gut runs the show i'll
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:17.360]  intellectually look at what the gut's saying and i always find the guts right i mean my gut is never
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:22.800]  wrong and the nose knows
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:30.880]  you can just see what's going on everywhere but it's just wild
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:34.720]  i want to go to your phone calls here i'm going to play a few trump clips first but
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:42.240]  the best thing all of us can do is spread the word about media outlets and organizations
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:48.000]  that care about freedom if you're listening to us on a local am or FM affiliate that station at a
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:54.480]  15 000 stations we're only on close to 170 80 stations or so is bucking the entire curve the
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:58.960]  entire system they're going through all sorts of bull to put us on it it's just amazing what
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:03.520]  the establishment does how the big networks operate how the advertising commons operate
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:07.920]  you should just know that person that group that owner that station is going through a lot
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:13.120]  support them become a sponsor send them a hundred dollars i mean this is a war folks
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:18.640]  the preciousness but but of any all that we have but even more important tell people about the
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:25.360]  station this is epic stuff this is a just one more view or one more guy on the radio anybody
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:31.600]  that's been listening a while knows we've got our finger on the zeitgeist believe me it's exhausting
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:38.720]  but it's also invigorating i i don't want to be at the zeitgeist at the fountain for whatever reason
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:48.640]  we are and i have a tender heart i know you have a tender heart but i'm also a man and i can come
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:54.240]  off as aggressive and hateful and mean this is a man wanting to defend the tender innocent people
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:37:04.320]  i i i do have a lot of feelings of of of anger and of rage and of commitment and i realize physicality
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:08.240]  some guy tries to mug you and i'm parking a lot with your kids yeah that's where
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:14.960]  physicality comes in this is a larger enemy i fight larger enemy you fight it's about brains
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:20.000]  it's about will it's about strength it's about commitment it's about long term fight
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:28.240]  and in that fight we find the animating spirit of liberty that god gave us we find ourselves
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:32.080]  in the darkness we find that light that god gave us on our heart
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:42.560]  and i know that we as liberty lovers are kindred spirits because we belong to god
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:48.960]  and a lot of times we're humble we're ashamed of ourselves because we are conscious
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:53.600]  but the fact that we love god transcends all of our worldliness
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:57.440]  and as long as we take action against evil that's all god's looking for
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:06.800]  and you already know that truth written on your heart written on your mind your soul god knew
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:14.160]  you before you were formed your mother's womb great evil is being lost against humanity right
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:19.840]  now i i think they're going to the new levels i see the evidence in the vaccines they are now
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:24.400]  attacking consciousness itself they're now going after free will itself with the additives of the
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:30.960]  food and water they're going to a new level right now and i can feel god's rage
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:37.520]  the god fearing in me
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:42.320]  shakes to my very core
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:48.240]  because the big volcano is getting ready to erupt
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:58.400]  and the petulant evil people have taken god's leniency as weakness god's kindness is weakness
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:04.800]  god's restraint is weakness have showed the wind and they will reap the whirlwind
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:11.360]  but in that fiery blast of judgment
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:19.120]  don't think that all of us will be spared
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:26.560]  but isn't it a great honor
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:34.480]  like a bowling ball thrown against the enemy to knock over all the pens
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:40.560]  isn't it the weapon god throws against the enemy that's the most honored
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:47.840]  that's where all of us should want to be
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:53.040]  because the devil deceives and twists people and leads them into darkness
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:40:01.360]  god uses free will and those that choose to commit until the end no matter how high the price may be
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:04.640]  to go on and to never surrender
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:12.560]  the paraphrase Winston Churchill we shall fight in the fields we shall fight in the streets we
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:17.600]  shall fight with growing strength and confidence in the air we shall fight in the mountains we
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:23.200]  shall fight in the ravines we shall fight across the world and never surrender
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:32.000]  nothing was in Churchill was perfect the point is the speech is true we shall go on to the end
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:40.880]  whatever the cost may be we'll never surrender i'm gonna go to your phone calls want to play
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:45.200]  these clips briefly i'm not going to belabor this we fund ourselves selling really good stuff
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:51.360]  like vitamin b12 of the purest organic form out there patented that is the most absorbable
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:56.400]  other than injectable that's our research secret 12 is amazing we're studies out about depression
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:02.560]  and mental activity and mental illness it's schizophrenia with folks that don't get enough
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:07.600]  vitamin b12 and a lot of its gut flora problems with the pesticides and the rest of it you can't
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:11.440]  absorb it so you need to get it by injection going to a doctor or you to get it under the tongue
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:16.640]  and you know i've been taking a lot of vitamin b12 you suppose i can't od on it but i tell you
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:21.200]  my brain works a lot better on it it's quite frankly transcendental transcendent i've been uh
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:25.840]  taking a lot of vitamin b12 i'll just tell you right now and you can look at the studies that
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:31.360]  are out there on it vitamin b12 decisions you link to depression Alzheimer's i mean schizophrenia
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:37.040]  i look it up for yourself i mean the point is you need vitamin b12 we also have 34% off i'm
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:41.440]  just still extending it because people are really taking action that's a good thing uh on the info

[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:42.240]  fund the operation but uh the enemy wants you dependent the enemy wants you unhealthy the
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:47.040]  enemy doesn't want you to be able to persevere like the ant not the grasshopper who doesn't
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:51.760]  prepare for the long winter we we hope this time isn't getting worse but uh you see what's

[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:19.040]  then for war store dot com okay enough ranting for me let's go ahead and play these clips and
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:24.880]  go to phone calls there's a bunch of these uh let's play as somebody what's the first clip
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:29.520]  darryl i've got so many that's right lion ted clip and then i'm just going to let you play each
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:35.360]  clip then i'll comment briefly after here it is let me ask you something sir what what do you
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:43.360]  like about that everything give me one everything give me one money pick any wall okay the wall
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:47.280]  that's the main thing all right great sense building the wall all right hold on a second
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:51.840]  now do you know on the wall that donald told the new york times editorial board he's not going to
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:44:01.280]  build a wall he's not going to deport anyone well well sir you know actually so he says donald
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:04.800]  isn't really going to build the wall never said he wouldn't not build the wall let's go to the next
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:11.040]  clip i have spent 20 years fighting to defend the second amendment and i'll tell you this sir if
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:16.480]  donald trump ever becomes president he is said on the supreme supreme court he's going to cut a deal
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:22.080]  with chuck schumer he said that in two debates ago which means he's going to put a liberal on
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:26.080]  the supreme court he's going to take away your second amendment right there is a reason why gun
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:31.120]  owners of america has endorsed me in this campaign because i've defended the second amendment while
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:36.240]  donald trump is a new york liberal who will take away your second amendment rights this man is lying
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:42.240]  to you and he's taking advantage of you let me add to that i love gun owners i love larry pratt i get
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:46.720]  while they're going with uh cruise is the on record the more conservative guy at least one
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:54.480]  is voting record but the background is there cruise can say these things but trump is on record
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:58.640]  saying he's a constructionist and would appoint people like scalia or even more conservative
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:03.760]  and his rhetoric is clear i mean phrases will go after him but we know where the bush is that
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:08.720]  are backing crews have been and they're anti-gun bush herbert walker and george dubby support the
[01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:13.680]  assault weapons man uh you name it so don't we have trump responding to that too don't we
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:18.880]  yeah yeah let's play trump responding to that in the moment and we'll go to the next clip
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:23.360]  but here's trump uh responding to that i think i'll be able to get along well with schumer chuck
[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:27.760]  schumer i was always very good with schumer i was close to schumer in many ways and you know it's
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:32.240]  important that you get along it's wonderful to say you're a maverick and you're going to stand up and
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:36.320]  you're going to close up the country and all of the things but you got to get somebody to go along
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:41.040]  with you you know you have a lot of people we have a system the founders created the system
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:47.040]  that actually is a very good system it does work but it can't work if you can get nobody to go along
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:52.320]  with you and that's the problem that you have with ted cruise he's a guy that nobody likes and
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:58.800]  nobody trusts and he is a nasty guy he says things that are very nasty all right i mean i can't
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:03.200]  stand Chuck schumer but trumps in new york that's the senator new york senior senator hillary was
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:06.960]  there as well you got to work with him they come after he said that he didn't like the system
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:12.720]  but he's not compromising the second amendment and he's not compromised he gets them to compromise
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:18.560]  and that i agree with let's go ahead and go to the next clip
[01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:25.360]  and then we're going to go to break and probably go to your calls even before we go to break
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:31.360]  there's a lot of these up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com here's the deal
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:36.960]  he's got such a populist movement behind him of libertarians and patriots and conservatives
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:41.040]  that if trump doesn't deliver it won't be like obama with his idiot followers that just shut
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:46.080]  up about it trump will be impeached he will be sued he will be anathema he will be gone after
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:52.560]  he's not asleep or selling my view because of how scared the system is they are literally
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:58.880]  doing everything they can to stop it and so that's why i am supporting trump he's not perfect but he
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:05.840]  is a again a symbol of populism and crews lying and saying trump's causing the rioting
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:10.560]  when the white house and the soros groups and the mecha and la raza and black lives matter are
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:16.480]  attacking he's doing that again today it's it's not trump causing that it's not trump doing that
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:23.600]  that's a lie and the bin karson stunt people would say well just don't bet on anybody then
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:27.280]  just sit back and say i don't trust any of them well i can feel like an intellectual elitist
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:32.080]  doing that not get the arena no no the system scared trump this is a nationalist across the
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:37.600]  board he hates political correctness i'm betting on him with a proviso that i don't totally think
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:41.360]  he's perfect and that we're going to be there to keep him honest but regardless we're going to get
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:45.680]  people elected at the state level the county level the city level the federal level this
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:49.680]  would all out move against the globalists so even if they have to pose as a patriot
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:55.760]  with donald trump it shows we're winning they try to then defeat him just credit populism
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:01.920]  then that's a problem this is very sophisticated i want to go to john and uh in maryland and matt
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:08.320]  and others john and maryland you're on the air welcome hello alex how you doing all right brother
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:16.240]  go ahead well i have a comment and a question the comment's real simple um i have not watched
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:22.880]  the glenn beck show or listened to the his radio program in two three years uh the other day i was
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:30.160]  perusing around looking for some campaign information and out of 45 minutes almost 30 of it was
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:36.880]  you're a crazy person well specifically you i don't mind anybody calling you crazy but
[01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:44.160]  truth is you've been proven right more often than not and it really reminded me of the liberals uh
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:49.280]  and the protesters screaming racist racist racist and not wanting to back anything up well here's the
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:56.160]  deal i mean look look they always say that the wise king uh which it's a parable poisoned a well to
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:49:00.640]  make everybody evil and psychotic and the wise king woke up everybody was evil and psychotic he
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:04.320]  went and drank from the well he was the only one hadn't drank from it he had his own water he went
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:10.160]  so he became psychotic everything was okay well i'm more wise than that if the nazis in 1940 were
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:15.120]  saying i was crazy because i wasn't going along with them i'm glad to be crazy um you know harvard
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:20.480]  admits fluorides causing massive cancer brain damage infertility that's that's roiders well i
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:25.520]  said that 20 years ago i've had the scientist on uh going back wants to use the term i'm crazy
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:30.800]  he's desperate he's scared he wants to try to discredit people using alex jones that's because
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:35.440]  they're so scared of what i say they run towards it to make fun of it because like vampires are
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:38.960]  scared of the light they're like i'm not scared of the light i go out in the noon all the time the
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:45.040]  noon sun's crazy it doesn't hurt me but he's down in his basement hiding from me um i'm
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:49.920]  fully aware he's attacking me i get the emails and stuff and it's all his listeners leaving him
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:55.280]  almost all the emails are god he's crazy we hate him he thinks he's god now uh so just forget glen
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:50:01.200]  beck he's going bankrupt in his own admission he's a joke he's destroyed uh and he just sits around
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:06.560]  studying how to bs people all day and so just being real and and and profound and and that's
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:12.320]  that's that's that's that's that prompts everything that's the ace of spades punk and uh so i don't
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:18.240]  have a personal beef with him i'm very sad that he's so low uh but yeah call me crazy all day yeah
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:25.600]  i'm crazy like a fox and crazy that i love freedom go ahead maybe the emperor has no
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:34.400]  clothes after all the uh my question is this i am really scared of one thing i see so many
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:41.600]  parallels of rfk and trump coming up what do you think they're trying to steal elections they're
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:48.880]  trying to throw the voice of the people down what do you think's going to happen if if uh we have
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:55.920]  another uh repeat of a california convention in rfk well i don't want to make a big issue out of it
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:03.120]  but i've got a real gut issue with with cleveland i my danger zone spidey sense is just like
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:10.080]  just never been slamming the the needle like it is and uh no he's i think trumps for real his
[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:14.800]  spirit scares him he just wants to eat cheeseburgers down a wealthy country and not screw america he
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:18.320]  doesn't hate america he doesn't have it out of the country he's not even perfect he just doesn't
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:26.320]  hate america he was brought up and they hate this country and they're coming after us and and yeah i
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:32.320]  think the detonator is they could kill trump stage false flags and claim his his supporters did it
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:36.560]  they've got tv shows and movies saying trump supporters are going to blow up federal buildings
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:41.280]  i mean folks they got tv shows saying it's coming for the lemmings and then when it happens duh
[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:46.880]  they're preparing everybody it's so stupid it's so obvious and so no i think it's uh in the cards
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:51.600]  you know i think you've been playing poker for five hours you've never seen the ace of spades
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:55.600]  yet you've never seen the ace of hearts you've never seen the ace of clubs this guy's probably
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:52:00.560]  keeping them in his hand in fact i'm pretty sure they got him uh we got gods what doesn't matter
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:05.040]  in the final equation everything the enemy does at this level uh this is this is this is an old
[01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:09.920]  bar death battle and no i i mean let me tell you they got the assassination teams ready they got
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:14.960]  schizophrenics ready wound up drugged up to let them into the meeting uh they've they've got
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:20.160]  assassination teams 24 seven ready to kill trump and trump knows that trump for a month went to
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:24.640]  scotland reportedly i heard about this before it was in the political six months before was gone
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:30.320]  for a month and just came back and said i'm not going to do it and then he he looked at his son
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:35.440]  who's autistic from vaccines and he looked at them carving the country up he looked at poor people
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.320]  he's he's kind of an egomaniac he hates seeing poor people he hates not seeing prosperity
[01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:47.200]  and it's just this classic american idea that his immigrant parents put into him and uh he just said
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:51.600]  no i mean why do they want to screw us this is bs he's kind of a thug at certain levels but he
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:55.600]  doesn't hate america he doesn't hate prosper he doesn't hate people that are successful he likes it
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:53:00.960]  and so they want to kill him they want to kill me they want to kill your future they hate us all
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:05.600]  there are a bunch of thugs that hate us who squat on top of us like the communist chinese
[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:10.320]  with their mobile death vans and 84 million killed under malin the 20 million killed under
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:14.960]  other chinese communists and they say you can't have him we said so he's a racist i mean a bunch of
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:21.040]  murdering grand champion filth telling us what to do i mean it's just it's just an over the top
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:28.080]  megalomania delusion of these people and john i totally agree with you i think i think it's about
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:33.520]  70 odds there's going to be an attempt on his life by the voting day of the general election
[01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:38.720]  and i think there's about a 40 chance they're going to kill donald trump better than a hammer
[01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:43.200]  and then i think they're going to blow stuff up and say that his listeners did it and
[01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:47.200]  just have left his comments run around and shoot every cop on the street they find and just
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:52.640]  burn everything as they hop around and just piss on everything as this is just all the
[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:57.920]  miserable decadent scum loves evil and they just dream that in some fiery inferno they're
[01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:02.080]  going to find power because they never had honor in their life so they think in some blood orgy
[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:05.760]  they're going to find it all they're going to find the blood orgies patriots defending their
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:12.320]  families mowing them down in defense so what do you say to that john keep up the good fight
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:19.840]  that's all that we can do is it's it's yeah it's going down this is world government this is it
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:25.760]  and even if trump is just a app is just a beginning primer i mean you can just see your gut your
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:30.160]  intellect everything it's just it's like in star trek when they're getting attacked and it's
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.160]  there's fire shooting out of the console i mean i don't know what's hitting this but it's bad i mean
[01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:43.040]  i just don't drink their water folks don't eat their gmo and don't take their shots
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:48.160]  because all the people are suddenly acting mentally ill retarded dumbed out i mean all
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:52.560]  the people suddenly that i've known for years can't talk and are just like oh it's like
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:56.000]  we're getting hit with some bad stuff i don't know what it is but everybody sees it that's
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:01.040]  still conscious and just pray for your consciousness pray for your consciousness folks that's all i
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:08.000]  can ask is just pray for consciousness pray that the enemy they got viruses they admit that eat
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:12.720]  parts of the cerebral cortex viral lobotomies it's just uh that's what's going on i'll just be frank
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:18.080]  with you and it's like a past hopping around everywhere getting off on it it's it's it's over
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:23.520]  the top i'm sorry stuff's so epic matt let's talk to the folks in new york matt you're on the year
[01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:32.480]  there hello alex yes sir so uh my girlfriend ali who's a listener too has a theory on bernie
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:39.040]  sanders and uh and that's that he's being used to get a large uh trendy base of voters so that
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:44.080]  when hillary gets the nomination she can pick bernie as her running mate to steal the election
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:48.640]  from trump because they have to make it plausible that she beats trump and by taking sanders as her
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:53.520]  running mate it makes this feel more plausible uh what do you think i think that'd be a great move
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:56:01.520]  for hillary it's kind of scary but notice it's every other country's in in game right now every
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:06.640]  other country's got the same weirdness going on this is a takeover this is a multi-thousand year
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:11.920]  globalist satanically influenced plan you are witnessing interdimensional
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:18.080]  consciousness that the bible warns of this is this is what it's like to face the enemy
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:26.640]  but we also have our own divine beyond the enemy's uh discernment so that's why you just
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:31.680]  got a call on god but god's free will the devil's not you gotta say god i can't handle this i need
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:34.480]  you to come into my life right now to deal with this and then god will do it
[01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:44.240]  anything else matt that was that was pretty much it i just uh i know i you know you don't
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:49.280]  like people to thank you but i'm i'm just i really appreciate what you well thank you the
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:55.040]  point is though i'm just in a fight for my family it's very humbling your support i i i love everybody
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:57:01.520]  and from these baston helms and the story that are with this little brain dead baby it won't leave
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:08.480]  its side you know it won't eat to just anything else that has empathy and humanity and it's
[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:13.600]  sad that dogs on average have more humanity than humans do because we've been dehumanized we've
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:21.440]  been destroyed we've been rendered down we've been uh born into a lie but it's the great contest
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:26.480]  that animates us this is the great test that separates the wheat from the chaff the metal from
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:32.880]  the from the trash tom in the great north of canada her britannic majesty's holding tom you're on the
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:42.880]  air hey alex uh just a young turks video a little while ago and shank yuger was saying that uh he's
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:47.280]  smarter than you and that maybe you're a little bit of a wimp what are your thoughts on that well
[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:52.160]  i mean he's got a name of the young turks that killed over a million um ethnic albanians for no
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:56.640]  reason so he thinks we're all done when he uses the name of a mass murdering crew of psychopathic
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:01.840]  killers that went after christians so then he tells us who he is doesn't he yeah fair point uh
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:08.560]  also he made that majesty comment uh so you still think that british um elites got a lot
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:13.840]  of influence in canada hey i tend to yeah when your prime ministers don't do what they say they
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:18.560]  suspend parliament and the queen's governor comes in and puts in who she wants uh yeah the queen of
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:24.960]  england's the biggest landowner in the world the transylvanian queen rules about that uh
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:29.920]  on this side of the border but uh another question for you what are your thoughts on the
[01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:35.600]  uh rwandan genocide how come you never talked about that uh i made a film about it i'm gonna come
[01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:40.400]  back and talk to you because you need to be talked to uh i never talked about the rwandan
[01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:45.680]  hootsie tutu genocide the unran made actually two films on that and that's just another un
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:50.160]  genocide what a that was our statement but i guess that's all you've got is deception

[02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:28.960]  he's hard charging for nationalism capitalism and not letting communist china and the communist pope
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:33.440]  established their authoritarian world government
[02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:40.880]  lord christopher montan joins us coming up the next segment tom in canada called in
[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:48.160]  and um he he said why aren't you covering the rwandan genocide of i guess 1993
[02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:54.720]  and i made films about it i've i've covered my film america destroyed by design expositions
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:58.800]  some of the others do i show the um peacekeepers their own photos torturing children to death
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:02.480]  and i've talked about the u n has these great war crimes around the world and why are they exempt
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:07.520]  with diplomatic community uh but i i didn't commit the war crimes let's say i'd never covered the
[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:13.280]  rwandan genocide let me ask tom is the rwandan genocide my fault what do you mean why haven't
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:19.840]  i covered it oh no i wasn't really accusing you like sound a little defensive there but uh i just
[02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:24.240]  wanted to know i'm not defensive you said why haven't covered the rwandan genocide i mean who's
[02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:29.680]  covered that hardly i mean i've made films about it written about it uh said it's a horrible tragedy
[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:34.400]  covered it not written hundreds of articles by my crew has and and so use a word like defensive
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:38.560]  uh i mean i'm i'm very scared of you and your intellect right now i'm so sorry
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:42.960]  yes you're right you've got me on my heels here uh tom are you defending the u n's genocide
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:51.280]  operations worldwide for carbon sinks oh wow absolutely not um all i gotta say about that is
[02:01:51.280 --> 02:02:01.840]  that is just sad and that's all that really is to it you take opiates tom no i don't why is that
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:07.520]  you sound drunk you don't sound like you're there oh no i'm here but uh yeah thanks for having me
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:12.480]  on i'll all right well thank you for calling in you know we're we we cover the u n's war crimes
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:16.000]  a lot do you think it's good the u n has diplomatic community who gives that to him
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:24.560]  um i'd say billionaires you know billionaires and heads of state got the most influence so
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:29.120]  i'd say yeah they give themselves diplomatic community they don't have that i don't care
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:34.960]  of that hitler gives himself to diplomatic community uh he doesn't have it well what
[02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:37.680]  do you think about the general state of the world what do you think about donald trump
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:45.920]  uh i like uh i like trump i think um he's uh he's good at talking for sure he's really
[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:52.480]  got the gift of god and i'll enjoy listening to him talk and i'd say probably probably he's
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:03:00.080]  better than cruz and uh regarding that whole election though in every other country uh the
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:03.760]  party at least just choose the candidate why does it take so long in america why you guys go
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:08.560]  through all that well normally the republicans just put up who they want finance and then people
[02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:13.760]  popularly vote they put laws in in their own regulations to steal elections but the public
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:18.800]  election is taxpayer funded it's a fraud to say popular vote doesn't count they just tried to
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:24.480]  sell that idea but people are roundly rejecting it so that's a very very good news thank you tom
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:30.880]  let's go take one more call before lord bonkton joins us let's go ahead and take another call

[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:46.160]  but uh anyway um you know on this china thing uh the super elite then can be kissinger to go out
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:51.600]  there and made a made a made a make a pact with bounce the tongue who was backed by the OSS by
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:57.680]  the way yes he was put in power by the OSS people don't know he's hard to cia but sure 10 people
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:04.160]  cia yeah but anyway he made a pact with him that we were going to start unloading our
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:11.600]  industry to china that they would become deep producers and we would become the consumers
[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:16.080]  of course this this is going to take place in uh you know gradually over the span of a years
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:22.240]  and so that was a pact that was made by the elite through henry kissinger but then in the 90s of
[02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:28.240]  course uh you know bill clinton started sending uh technology to upgrade their that's right they
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:31.440]  weren't supposed to be military they were supposed to stay in their own area and china's been breaking
[02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:36.720]  the back the globalist double crossed america as they always plan to in phase two stay there
[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:42.320]  because you can carlos i'm gonna go back to you when i go to lord bonkton on this subject but first
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:50.560]  we're going to cover wood lord bonkton the uk leaving the eu straight ahead the latest global
[02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:57.600]  carbon taxes to selectively shut down industry and how to defeat the anti-human eugenics based
[02:04:57.600 --> 02:05:04.720]  world government i'm alex shows a warning to the united states from the government
[02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:12.800]  of saudi arabia release the 28 pages and face an economic collapse there is a federal lawsuit
[02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:19.040]  that could reveal the contents of the 28 still classified pages of the 9 11 commission report
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:24.720]  and in it there is compelling evidence that links saudi officials to the 9 11 hijackers
[02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:30.480]  according to the new york times if the bill to release the 28 pages is passed it would clear
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:36.400]  a path for the role of the saudi government to be examined in the september 11 attacks well
[02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:41.280]  that's something that should have happened a long time ago and wouldn't you know it obama just like
[02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:48.320]  george w wants the 28 pages kept secret even though saudi involvement in 9 11 should have been
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:55.440]  considered an act of war in the recent threats to destroy our economy yet another act of terrorism

[02:06:35.920 --> 02:06:41.280]  than anyone else including their other distributors i did this because of info wars power in the

[02:07:02.720 --> 02:07:09.200]  thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the drums of war
[02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:15.600]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago
[02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:22.000]  when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:28.880]  sirens but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food
[02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:35.200]  and water into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate
[02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:42.400]  our journey towards death i personally counter this onslaught with anthraplex anthraplex is designed
[02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:50.480]  with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity
[02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:55.680]  inside the human body discover why anthraplex has turned so many heads today it's time for us to take
[02:07:55.680 --> 02:08:07.920]  our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at info wars life dot com with anthraplex
[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:13.920]  in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted emblems
[02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:20.240]  whether sought or unsought by the military industrial commonwealth in dallas texas three
[02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:26.240]  shots were fired at president kennedy's motorcade in downtown dallas the first report to say that
[02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:34.560]  president kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting it is a big idea a new world order
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:42.560]  it was almost as if it were planned in full kick just pancake
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:48.800]  either you are with us or you are with the terrorists
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:06.800]  but i also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that ak-47s belong in the hands of soldiers not
[02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:15.680]  the hands of criminals guns will be taken no one will be able to be all we can take all of them
[02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:20.240]  for many of the police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this in america
[02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:25.600]  city global governance at last is it one world the central bank is in charge but aren't we all
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:32.240]  just living and dying from what the central banks do and for me give me liberty or give me death
[02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:39.360]  life from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:48.720]  the brexit is happening the u k is pulling out of an organization that makes the vast majority
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:53.360]  of its laws outside of law and doesn't even have an elected government has a ceremonial
[02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:59.920]  parliament that is being more and more dominated by u kip organization founded by
[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:06.720]  patria nizel forage and other folks involved like lord mongton who has the website science
[02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:11.280]  of public policy dot org he was the top advisor to market thatcher inventor newspaper editor
[02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:16.320]  you name it he's a classical architect trained orator
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:22.240]  high priest of climate skepticism lord mongton was capital advisor to market thatcher as u k
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:27.200]  prime minister from 82 to 86 on leaving ten downing three to establish successful specialist
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:31.360]  consultancy company doing technical advice corporations government lord mongton's knowledge
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:36.240]  of science and politics began on global warming is noted for its breadth and depth
[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:41.440]  he's given speeches all over the world and then films you name it they call for his arrest openly
[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:48.080]  they are now calling for the arrest of anyone's challenging man-made climate change no longer
[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:54.640]  warming science of public policy dot org also what's up with that dot com he frequently writes for
[02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:58.400]  and i want to get him on though not about because of the science and the proof and
[02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:04.080]  the sun is heating us up yeah i know the scientists say that i get it i it's like saying you know if
[02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:08.960]  you pour gasoline on something and strike a match is going to be on fire i mean i mean i get it
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:14.800]  gasoline runs a car too the sky's blue waters wet fish swim in the ocean but that's why he's a
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:20.560]  conspiracy theorist folks he says things like two plus two equals four but the reason i wanted to
[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:28.960]  get him on today and take some of your calls coming up is this is seismic to have you kip around a
[02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:33.280]  few decades and now go from nowhere to fastest growing party in europe and the uk that's in the
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:40.240]  news i'm not kidding look it up and especially like a libertarian nationalist patriot organization
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:44.000]  i would even say it's as hardcore as someone like donald trump it's just hey we shouldn't have one
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:49.440]  sided trade deals hey eu bureaucrat shouldn't make the most of our laws it's almost 90 percent now
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:54.560]  keeps growing and even the liberal mayor of london's coming out sounding like lord bonkton
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:12:02.080]  i mean this is this is exciting i don't want to say we have victory but we are turning the tide
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:06.720]  i think that's the first statement the problem is we're turning the tide of public opinion and
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:13.280]  ideas but they don't care they're going full authoritarian in my view lord bonkton christopher
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:17.520]  bonkton will correct me if he thinks i'm wrong but i want to get into e referendum poll tracker
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:22.240]  is britain heading for the rigsit and what does the uk think of europe well it's not europe it's not
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:26.880]  here against spain or france or germany that's hijacked too and then let's bring in five million
[02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:32.640]  people the last three years and arrest you if you criticize radical muslims being able to rape
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:39.200]  women i mean this is getting crazy then we enter the mental illness of the left to ally with any
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:46.320]  group who wants to bring down classical capitalism or what's left of it it's a it's a i've seen this
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:51.840]  in crazy people even if they're smart and have power they will destroy themselves in some will
[02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:58.000]  to dominate someone else and i think we're seeing the true mental illness of the leftist elite
[02:12:58.800 --> 02:13:02.400]  and their behavior so we're going to cover that article we're going to cover why is the
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:08.240]  rigsit camp so obsessed with immigration because that's all they have uh and of course this is the
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:12.560]  globalist running all this it's how they're conquering the culture european report card
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:17.120]  worries over euro growth you know will greece do the same thing as britain because britain
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:22.480]  does this everybody else is gonna leave everyone's lining up for the rigsit but voters aren't fooled
[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:29.440]  oh voters aren't fooled should global warming deniers be prosecuted newsweek i mean this is all
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:35.680]  happening democratic ag's climate change groups collude on prosecuting dissenters
[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:43.520]  email show that's just some of what we're covering so where are we politically globally
[02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:49.760]  where is the authoritarian eugenics left is what i call them going where is the collaborator
[02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:54.960]  right going where does this free humanity go from here to break down the current scoreboard
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:14:00.320]  in the epic battle for humanity and the true renaissance moving forward and the real enlightenment
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:04.320]  is lord christopher mocton it's great to have you on christopher so much has happened the last
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:09.200]  three four months we haven't had you on please give us the state of the world my friend all right
[02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:17.120]  let's begin with brexit that's the british exit from the european dictatorship or the european
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:21.920]  union as it likes to call itself but of course as you rightly said it now makes getting on for 90
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:27.760]  percent of britain's laws our parliament is merely a kind of rubber stamp which has to pass
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:33.360]  directives that are handed down to us by the unelected commissars that's the official german
[02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:39.840]  name for the 30 commissioners who behind closed doors dream up the laws that we now have to abide
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:46.880]  by and the european parliament itself has no power to bring forward a bill but the breaking news
[02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:53.040]  alex is that with 50 days to go to the referendum on june the 23rd we're now made the third so june
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:15:01.920]  23rd 50 days to go the opinion polls are suddenly trending very firmly in the direction of brexit
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:08.080]  the latest poll of polls done by the financial times which is wholly in favor of britain staying in
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:14.320]  its part of the anti-democratic environment environmentalist and political left-wing
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:19.840]  establishment its paper is even printed it's printed on pink paper which is a fairly good
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:26.160]  guide to its politics the even the financial times is now reporting in its poll of polls today
[02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:31.920]  that there's been a sudden drop in don't knows and nearly three quarters of the don't knows have come
[02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:40.880]  into the brexit side of it so that now it's 46 to stay in the eu and 44 to come out and still around
[02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:47.440]  11 undecided so it looks to me as though if one does the analysis i used to do for margaret that
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:53.440]  you're at 10 downing street and you take the trend line of how the polls are showing over the last
[02:15:53.440 --> 02:16:00.960]  six months what is happening is an inexorable trend towards a crossover point in probably about two
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:07.680]  weeks time at which point i would expect the opinion polls to start showing brexit in the lead
[02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:13.840]  and i think that then it'll be kind of neck and neck from then on so it could go either way but on
[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:22.000]  present trends we are going to leave the european union with a vote of around 47 to leave and 43
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:28.720]  percent to stay that is my current forecast amazing you know we've seen the communist
[02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:34.320]  chinese who have the record for mass murder and the pope and the mexico and the saudi arabian
[02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:40.160]  human rights commission when they chop gay people's heads off telling us we can't have donald trump
[02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:45.280]  and lying about him and then we have obama and hillary telling people in the uk what you can do
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:50.880]  and threatening you and comparing you to nazis if you don't stay in the u what when as you know
[02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:55.520]  that you was a nazi project originally well i mean that in fact is very helpful to us uh
[02:16:55.520 --> 02:17:00.800]  mr obama coming over here and trying to preach to us this is a man whose birth certificate is a
[02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:07.040]  manifest forgery who has presided over the greatest collapse in the american economy and in the american
[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:13.120]  military and in the american standing around the world uh of any president in peace by man if somebody
[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:20.080]  like that comes over here and tells us how we should vote in a referendum which has nothing to do with
[02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:25.200]  the united states then that has been enormously beneficial to us because i was about to say so
[02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:31.360]  where's the arrogance disconnect i mean this shows how disconnected these people are what it shows
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:37.760]  is that the british people are fed up with the global establishment for that is what it is it's
[02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:43.840]  cameron in obama's pocket you know perking out of his little front pocket there's there's cameron
[02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:49.360]  sitting there as obama's poodle we don't like seeing that in our prime ministers we like in our
[02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:54.960]  prime ministers to be meant as margaret thatcher was the only man in her cabinet it was to be said of her
[02:17:54.960 --> 02:18:01.680]  and david cameron is a wimp obama is a wimp and he is trying to preach to us and that has done an
[02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:08.640]  enormous amount of good that has helped decide the undecided man why are they so arrogant and
[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:18.080]  disconnected i think it's because they've had the running for so long the natural state of government
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:23.360]  if you read the early chinese philosophers is legalist it is totalitarian because governments
[02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:29.280]  like to interfere people who go into politics like to interfere with our lives but every so often the
[02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:36.080]  libertarians get their say and the extraordinary thing about this brexit poll is that we have got
[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:44.240]  that uh referendum in the teeth of opposition by the entire british european american and global
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:49.120]  establishment both the political and the economic establishment virtually every church virtually
[02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:54.080]  every business virtually every trade union virtually every government is in favor of britain
[02:18:54.080 --> 02:19:00.240]  staying in the e u because it can't bear to face the fact that we don't like totalitarianism in
[02:19:00.240 --> 02:19:06.240]  britain and we are now as it looks at the moment going to vote against it and vote effectively
[02:19:06.240 --> 02:19:13.600]  because if we vote no by however narrow a majority then we will come out and that is that and that
[02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:19.600]  will be a real blow to the e u which uh almost certainly immediately after the referendum
[02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:25.040]  whichever way it goes greece is going to be driven out of the euro it's already making
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:31.200]  secret emergency plans to reintroduce the drachma and preferably the hard drachma which is what i've
[02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:39.040]  advised it to do but they uh greece is going to come out of the european currency the euro within
[02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:46.800]  weeks of this brexit the only reason still in there is because the europeans don't want britains to

[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:38.240]  want to compete don't want to build things don't want to have ideas to be successful they don't
[02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:44.000]  want the free association of the renaissance they want to dominate there's low level leftist
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:50.080]  there's big corporate combines they all compete for grandiose plans of control and it's our system
[02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:54.960]  of freedom that competes against them now set beside each other we always win the problem is
[02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:58.800]  patriots people that love humanity aren't very good at articulating our plans because we're just
[02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:05.280]  too busy living we don't want to run other people's lives we're we're content we're confident but we
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:09.040]  have to take the field against the enemy the dragons of our age and believe me they're there
[02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:14.400]  what does lord bonkin make of the populist movement in places like austria coming to power
[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:22.320]  the new president or donald trump the systems attack is what certifies someone a six percent trust
[02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:28.960]  in the ap for mainstream media similar numbers in the uk i think the establishment's already
[02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:34.240]  collapsed they just don't know it yet or maybe they do lord bonkin long segment coming up to get
[02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:38.960]  into the latest carbon taxes and their tyrannical push to regulate control on human life but
[02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:45.040]  the big theme where would you say the world is right now because you're starting to get to it i mean
[02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:49.920]  aren't we winning even if we lose this referendum people now realize the EU's running us it's making
[02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:56.560]  its laws it's dictatorial i mean uh inexorably isn't the tide turning for human freedom i think
[02:25:56.560 --> 02:26:02.080]  there's no doubt that this referendum was a great achievement just to get a referendum on this question
[02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:08.800]  and that in itself was a victory and the fact that the result is as close as it is on the opinion
[02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:16.480]  polls so far is also a victory because it's a very clear reminder to those who created and are driving
[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:24.080]  and profiting from the european union and various other globalizing scams of this kind that the
[02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:30.480]  ordinary people don't actually like them it is the establishment and its lack is who are voting to
[02:26:30.480 --> 02:26:36.080]  stay in almost unanimously it's ordinary people who have to pay for all this who are almost
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:42.880]  unanimously voting to get out and so this is a big moment the fact that we even get to have our say
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:48.320]  and okay it could marginally go the wrong way though i think it will marginally go the right way
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:53.920]  but the great thing is that now that we've got the right to have our say this is an indication
[02:26:53.920 --> 02:26:59.600]  that if we don't just sit back and allow the establishment to run everything if we start
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:07.280]  taking things back into our own control then suddenly piece by piece we can start running
[02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:13.200]  our own lives and gradually take away from governments host waves of what governments now
[02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:19.520]  do you see here they are governments trying to do science and making a terrible mess of it on this
[02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:25.280]  global warming thing there's a very this is breaking news alex there's a very important paper out
[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:34.640]  today by professor ray baits of university college doubling in ireland now he until three or four
[02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:40.400]  years ago when he and i debated the science of climate in front of the law society of ireland
[02:27:40.400 --> 02:27:46.960]  in gallway he was a true believer in the official position but there were one or two things i showed
[02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:52.640]  him in that debate which led him to write to me afterwards and say that i had made him nervous
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:57.680]  about whether the science was all that he had thought it was and he was going to do some
[02:27:57.680 --> 02:28:04.800]  checking he spent three years and now he's published his paper which retracts his previous
[02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:11.760]  position and says that because they've made a fundamental mistake in the climate models
[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:16.080]  over the supposed amplification of direct warming caused by what are called temperature
[02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:22.720]  feedback wow he is the world's greatest expert on temperature feedbacks and he now recognizes
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:28.480]  that the equation that they're using to measure this supposed amplification or describe it is
[02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:34.960]  the wrong equation and therefore the model is fatally flawed and funny enough his estimate
[02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:40.880]  of how much warming you will get if you double the co2 in the atmosphere this is what is known as
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:49.920]  climate sensitivity his estimate of that figure is exactly the same as mine when i published it
[02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:54.320]  in the bulletin of the chinese academy of sciences together with three very distinguished
[02:28:54.320 --> 02:28:59.440]  colleagues dr willy soon from harvard professor ligates from delaware was it that they're most
[02:28:59.440 --> 02:29:08.640]  red paper ever that that's still to this day is by a factor of 12 the most red paper in the 60
[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:12.960]  year archive of the bulletin of the china i know you don't get into this for credit you get into
[02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:17.440]  this to fight tyranny but lord mongton you're amazing your own research as a lay scientist
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:21.280]  or the inventor i know you're trained as well you just keep getting even scientists admit
[02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:26.080]  they're wrong and i'm glad they're honorable i know that's that article's out now admitting that you
[02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:31.680]  were right i mean that's just you're amazing about rebates when he and i debated the local
[02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:36.800]  communists turned up in the way that they usually do and a sneering communist got up at the back
[02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:42.560]  after i finished speaking said you know professor baits uh monkton said you were wrong about things
[02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:48.000]  how can i want to hear about the commie seven we come back this is so exciting lord mongton a force

[02:33:50.960 --> 02:33:55.840]  about mainstream media that is now all over the news the inquirer is getting the coverage
[02:33:55.840 --> 02:34:00.320]  when wane madson wrote that for us and he didn't say that he just said here's a photo of him looks

[02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:29.120]  doing you're funding pro human pro liberty freedom organization that reaches now conservatively
[02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:35.360]  it's 25 26 million a few months ago the conservative numbers if you count youtube and facebook with
[02:37:35.360 --> 02:37:42.160]  videos watched and terrestrial radio and tv 28 million quite frankly that was a few weeks ago
[02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:48.080]  we had like 14 million views now of just the stuff they shot in california in the last week on four
[02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:54.960]  different platforms i mean you had that the metrics like 34 million now the point is we are rampaging
[02:37:54.960 --> 02:38:03.520]  like liberty fueled rhinoceros is over the enemy right now so all over fox news seeing and i'm not
[02:38:03.520 --> 02:38:08.400]  counting that our footage is everywhere no one would see the larica and quistas hopping around
[02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:12.320]  saying kill the green goes waving mexican flags nothing against his panics most of them are into
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:16.960]  that this is what our leftist groups have funded no one would see the black lives matter and social
[02:38:16.960 --> 02:38:21.600]  justice warriors screaming all whites are evil kill them when they're white people saying it
[02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:27.200]  no one would see the literal brainwash gum if it wasn't for our teams all over the country in the
[02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:33.120]  world now we're hiring more reporters more camera crews i'm all in i have not been paid i'm not bragging
[02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:38.880]  but i'm not money-based here i have not been paid this year yet no matter i got family ranch since
[02:38:38.880 --> 02:38:44.560]  1829 and i don't need money okay i'm not rich but i'm taking care of i'm taking everything and putting
[02:38:44.560 --> 02:38:50.240]  it in right now all went in the sales everything committed history is being affected the battle
[02:38:50.240 --> 02:38:56.000]  space is being affected this is an epic time going back to lord bonkton lord bonkton recap this big
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:00.800]  professor coming out that you debated famously and saying you're right at science and public policy
[02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:05.120]  dot org where do we read about it what's the latest attacks on our energy system then i want to take
[02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:10.560]  some phone calls right now so far because this paper is so new it hasn't been written about
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:16.240]  anywhere i've got an advanced copy of it oh this is breaking wow thank you breaking news this is the
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:23.680]  first time anyone's heard about it and it's a very exciting paper by professor ray bait and as i was
[02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:29.120]  just saying before the break when he and i debated this and up get one of the local irish communists
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:34.240]  and said oh professor bates he says you're wrong but he's not a scientist and you are so therefore
[02:39:34.800 --> 02:39:40.480]  he must be wrong ray bates went up to the microphone this is unprecedented in my experience it shows the
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:48.080]  quality of the man and he said look it must be plain to you as it is to me that lord bonkton is
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:54.800]  knowledgeable about this subject and he and his arguments should be treated fairly and with respect
[02:39:54.800 --> 02:40:00.240]  now that's very unusual for anyone on the other side of the debate to say a thing like that and
[02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:07.280]  they usually say a rescue they usually say a rescue that's right and we'll come on to that
[02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:13.760]  in a moment but i just want to finish off on ray bates because this is the world expert on
[02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:19.440]  temperature feedbacks now that's these amplifying mechanisms which are imagined by the computer
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:24.080]  models and the intergovernmental panel on climate change and all the other spooky people and they
[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:30.240]  try to say this multiplies by three the small direct warming from carbon dioxide now professor
[02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:37.360]  bates has now having what were my doubts were about the feedback equation he has now confirmed
[02:40:37.360 --> 02:40:42.960]  that the feedbacks don't work in the way that all the climate models say they do and that if you
[02:40:42.960 --> 02:40:49.360]  correct for that huge error then you're looking not at three or four Celsius degrees of warming
[02:40:49.360 --> 02:40:54.960]  per doubling of co2 concentration you're looking at the one Celsius of warming which is what we
[02:40:54.960 --> 02:41:00.880]  published in the chinese science bulletin 18 months ago and he's now agreeing with that figure and
[02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:07.920]  saying yes that is the correct figure we don't have a climate problem anymore and this is an
[02:41:07.920 --> 02:41:13.760]  extraordinary piece of news because this is this was one of the i went say an arch enemy because
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:19.360]  this is too honorable a man too diligent a scientist to be an enemy of anyone he just loves his science
[02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:26.480]  but the fact that he has come out and said i can no longer sit and pretend for the sake of
[02:41:27.280 --> 02:41:32.240]  getting on well with my mates fortunately he's now retired so he's rather more free to speak
[02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:36.560]  out than he would have been if he was still working as you know in academia now if you take the wrong
[02:41:36.560 --> 02:41:41.920]  side in this debate you are punished most severely by the hard left in the marxists in the academic
[02:41:41.920 --> 02:41:49.280]  institutions so he is now retired so they can't do that to him but nevertheless this is an enormously
[02:41:49.280 --> 02:41:53.680]  significant well it takes an amazing person when they've been proven wrong to admit it
[02:41:54.880 --> 02:41:58.960]  well i mean it's extraordinary that he should come out and change his mind on this
[02:41:58.960 --> 02:42:04.960]  having done three years of very detailed work and it took nearly a year to get this paper
[02:42:04.960 --> 02:42:11.120]  passed but he now realizes they were giving him false equations yeah they the the the the central
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:16.400]  equation that is used to calculate how much warming we're going to get contains a very large
[02:42:16.400 --> 02:42:22.000]  error and that's what the significance of ray baits his paper is it demonstrates just how large
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:27.600]  that error is it multiplies the actual warming by three well he's a very classy scientist i want to
[02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:32.800]  play bill nye because as their science crumbles as they're privy to be fraud as even mainstream news
[02:42:32.800 --> 02:42:38.240]  admits higher co2 is good for plants good for humans they're openly saying let's start locking people
[02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:44.640]  up this is really a drumbeat attorney generals doing it in the u.s very creepy i can tell you why
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:51.680]  they're doing it they're doing it because they know that we the um fraud investigation group
[02:42:52.240 --> 02:42:58.320]  of the international committee on geoethics which is a new ethical grouping which was founded last
[02:42:58.320 --> 02:43:03.440]  year by professor nicholas murner of sweden who's the world's greatest expert on sea level
[02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:08.640]  he got so fed up with the dishonesty in science that he and several distinguished colleagues
[02:43:08.640 --> 02:43:13.440]  got together and founded an international committee and they have also established as part of that
[02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:20.480]  committee a fraud investigation group which i run and one of the things we are about to do is to start
[02:43:20.480 --> 02:43:26.640]  prosecuting people on the other side who have actually committed certain specific and by the
[02:43:26.640 --> 02:43:30.880]  way you got al gore's film exposed they can still show it they just had to admit all the lies in it
[02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:36.400]  so you've had a lot of success already that's right we did this in 2007 in the high court in london
[02:43:36.400 --> 02:43:41.360]  when uh we took al gore's movie to court we took the government to court for wanting to give at
[02:43:41.360 --> 02:43:48.640]  20 a pop copies of this ghastly sci-fi comedy horror movie to every school in england and they were
[02:43:48.640 --> 02:43:56.560]  only allowed to do it if they also circulated 77 pages of corrective guidance that he may put in
[02:43:56.560 --> 02:44:02.160]  so that was a huge victory for us and now we're going after them not in the civil court but we're
[02:44:02.160 --> 02:44:06.000]  going after them in the criminal court you promise to do that it's very exciting i want to get to
[02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:11.760]  that now but let's show the empire striking back the communist globalist empire let's play bill nigh
[02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:17.760]  when mark marino another great champion only second to you went out and asked him quote you're not
[02:44:17.760 --> 02:44:24.000]  really going to call for a rest this is what bill nigh with sickening pleasure starts licking his lips
[02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:30.640]  almost talking about arresting people and he says in ron when in ron with al gore came up with the
[02:44:30.640 --> 02:44:36.320]  scam so the richness of this is just too good here it is we interviewed robert f kennedy jr the
[02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:43.200]  environmentalist here at the people's climate march in 2014 september he said that the climate
[02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:48.480]  deniers his word and energy ceo's belong at the haig with three square meals in a cot with all the
[02:44:48.480 --> 02:44:53.360]  other war criminals what is your thought on that do you think some of the rhetoric on your side as
[02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:56.640]  i'm sure both sides but some of the rhetoric on your side gets too carried away i mean you know
[02:44:56.640 --> 02:45:01.920]  what's your thought on jailing skeptics as war criminals uh we'll see what happens uh was it
[02:45:01.920 --> 02:45:09.280]  appropriate to jail the guys from enron interesting okay right so we'll see what happens if was it
[02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:14.640]  appropriate to jail people from the cigarette industry who insisted insisted that this addictive
[02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:21.360]  product was not addictive and so on and you think about in these cases for me as a taxpayer and voter
[02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:27.280]  uh the doubting the introduction of this extreme doubt when you go with extreme doubt
[02:45:27.280 --> 02:45:34.240]  about climate change is affecting my quality of life as a public citizen so i can see where
[02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:40.320]  people are very concerned about this and are pursuing criminal investigations as well as uh
[02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:45.760]  as well as engaging in discussions like this all right we're gonna go back to lord mocton in a
[02:45:45.760 --> 02:45:51.760]  moment but talk about stealing free speech here he is the fake conservative george will uh in this
[02:45:51.760 --> 02:45:56.720]  weekend's edition of the washington post if trump is nominated the gop must keep him out of the
[02:45:56.720 --> 02:46:03.680]  white house and then he goes on to say quote a convention sovereign duty saying that party
[02:46:03.680 --> 02:46:08.800]  members are sovereign is to choose a plausible nominee who has a reasonable chance to win so
[02:46:08.800 --> 02:46:14.480]  forget the voters that's ceremonial not to passively affirm the will of a mere plurality of
[02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:21.520]  voters recorded episodically in a protracted process now why i get to that is no nice saying
[02:46:21.520 --> 02:46:25.280]  yeah we should look at arresting people nope and lord mocton's always chief among them that's all
[02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:31.200]  over the news and then george will say we never have elections who says you ever voted again there
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:36.640]  is such an authoritarianism showing itself don't they get it's already backfiring lord mocton
[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:42.800]  they don't you see the reason why there's all this stuff but from bill nye and others about
[02:46:42.800 --> 02:46:48.880]  prosecuting us is that they know they wouldn't stand a chance if they tried to prosecute us
[02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:54.640]  because we would then be able to produce all the evidence in court that they try to conceal from the
[02:46:54.640 --> 02:46:59.680]  people in the mainstream media that's what happened in the algore case in in in london hoisted on their
[02:46:59.680 --> 02:47:05.120]  own spirit saw the enormous overwhelming crushing weight of it i wrote the 80 pages of scientific
[02:47:05.120 --> 02:47:11.520]  testimony which won the case and once the judge saw that uh the other side simply collapsed and
[02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:16.400]  caved in and said okay okay it's a fair cop the film shouldn't be shown unless people are warned
[02:47:16.400 --> 02:47:22.000]  that it's inaccurate and this was an extraordinary victory but what we are now doing is we are not
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:26.080]  just waving our hands around and saying we're going to prosecute everybody we're saying there
[02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:32.960]  are a few people who are saying specific things which constitute scientific fraud they're making money
[02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:38.880]  and causing us losses as taxpayers by deliberately getting the science wrong and misrepresenting
[02:47:38.880 --> 02:47:43.760]  off on the result that's the key they're getting taxpayer money and and fearmongering their frauds
[02:47:43.760 --> 02:47:50.560]  what we are going to do is to go to the court with specific individual cases we don't go around
[02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:55.280]  waving our arms like windmills and saying everyone who believes global warming is a problem ought to
[02:47:55.280 --> 02:47:59.840]  be locked up which is the way they're doing it for us we're saying there are a few people
[02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:05.040]  who have acted in a definite well sure what about saying hide the decline and telling other universities
[02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:10.640]  to hide the decline to get funding that's clear fraud in the public in my view i i think that's
[02:48:10.640 --> 02:48:16.880]  right and i think the professor who who uh went in for that uh ought to have been arrested and put
[02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:23.440]  on trial he wasn't uh it's not something for us to do now we we've got much more recent cases
[02:48:23.440 --> 02:48:30.160]  where there has been deliberate misrepresentation by so-called scientists of their scientific results
[02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:35.120]  for the sake of pushing a purely political agenda which is very much to the cost of the
[02:48:35.120 --> 02:48:40.480]  ordinary taxpayer and which will show no benefit whatsoever let me interrupt you got a great point
[02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:44.720]  so i'm gonna interrupt i'm gonna repeat you're joining us over for over there in the uk i want
[02:48:44.720 --> 02:48:47.920]  to go to break come back and do a few phone calls maybe five minutes over the next hour if you
[02:48:47.920 --> 02:48:52.560]  got to go understand i'll take a few calls great questions from callers there overall how was the
[02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:56.400]  fight going i said i think we're turning the tide but they're authoritarian and don't care
[02:48:56.400 --> 02:49:02.560]  i mean is it fair to say though we're having some big victories i think we are now winning on far
[02:49:02.560 --> 02:49:08.000]  more fronts than the establishment would like to admit the governing class has had it its own way
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:14.560]  for quite some time now but the eu uh brexit referendum that the fact that it's as close as
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:19.600]  it is has come as a terrible shock to those who told us that everyone was in favor of the european
[02:49:19.600 --> 02:49:26.080]  union they now know that that is not the case likewise the fact that the extremists and the
[02:49:26.080 --> 02:49:31.440]  climate debate are demanding in a vague sort of way that everyone who speaks out and says that
[02:49:31.440 --> 02:49:36.400]  climate isn't a problem all the global warming isn't a problem should be arrested the fact that
[02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:42.480]  they are forced into that kind of extreme shows are a thought they know they've lost and i think
[02:49:42.480 --> 02:49:46.800]  what is happening here is that on the eu on the climate and across the two are related because
[02:49:46.800 --> 02:49:52.000]  the totalitarians in the eu are at one with the totalitarians in the climate they're at one with
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:59.040]  the totalitarians in the muslim movement totalitarians worldwide are standing together in a way which
[02:49:59.040 --> 02:50:05.120]  has never been seen before i agree hasn't the left miscalculated has the left miscalculated
[02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:11.920]  aligning itself not just with islam but the most nasty forms of it certainly jeremy corbin
[02:50:11.920 --> 02:50:18.080]  in this country now faces he's the leader of the labor party he's a communist he has faced
[02:50:18.080 --> 02:50:24.480]  terrific criticism in the last week because his party has been found not only to be anti-semite

[02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:53.600]  from london very popular host paul in of his own self now is a huge star for liberty i just exploding
[02:54:53.600 --> 02:54:58.320]  everywhere i made him get on air he's been working for me 16 years but five years ago i said i'm cutting
[02:54:58.320 --> 02:55:01.920]  your pay if you don't go on air and that guy i don't want to do it i said you're going on air
[02:55:01.920 --> 02:55:06.720]  he's smarter than i am that guy this is huge now so exciting that's why if you're a liberty lover get
[02:55:06.720 --> 02:55:11.120]  on the air do a youtube channel i'm telling you folks build it they will come this is the animating
[02:55:11.120 --> 02:55:16.480]  contest but lord montan briefly i want to go to these calls from uh bush different collars ron and
[02:55:17.280 --> 02:55:22.640]  gene and hb and mel and nelson what do you think of donald trump no matter who he really is
[02:55:22.640 --> 02:55:28.080]  the fact that he's populist they're demonizing him that only makes him more popular that shows me
[02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:35.680]  the system is out of gas well let me say one thing which is i have met ted cruise and i like him
[02:55:35.680 --> 02:55:42.080]  and i think he would probably be more experienced uh at running the presidency than donald trump
[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:50.160]  would be however when you see people like george will going around and saying well the mere people
[02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:58.000]  and their votes the mere plurality hello a pluribus unum is on your currency plurality which means
[02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:03.360]  the most people who vote that's what happens that's what's called democracy it's what your
[02:56:03.360 --> 02:56:08.800]  republic is supposed to be all about and if george will whom i normally quite admire has
[02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:14.480]  lost the plot on that he's lost the plot on everything and i think that looking at this one
[02:56:14.480 --> 02:56:20.400]  of the most unpopular things about donald trump is that he has been so successful because like you
[02:56:20.400 --> 02:56:26.640]  alex he has said boo to the establishment he's broken every political rule in the book and every
[02:56:26.640 --> 02:56:32.640]  time he breaks one up he goes in the polls and i must say although i don't think he's the best
[02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:36.240]  candidate for president i think he would be fairly disastrous in the white house because i don't
[02:56:36.240 --> 02:56:43.280]  think he would know how to run things um i do think that if he is chosen fair and square then he
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:50.160]  should be in the white house sure exactly i've had my own issues it's it's the it's the arrogance of
[02:56:50.160 --> 02:56:54.240]  saying you can't have him that's backfiring it's almost like they're doing it on purpose but i don't
[02:56:54.240 --> 02:56:59.360]  want to get that conspiratorial well i think it sometimes does look as though they're doing it
[02:56:59.360 --> 02:57:04.320]  on purpose to help him out because george will really ought to know better than to waffle on
[02:57:04.320 --> 02:57:09.520]  about a mere plurality in a in a protracted process of course it's a protracted process
[02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:14.240]  because everybody has to get their chance to vote that takes time arrogance but it's still
[02:57:14.240 --> 02:57:21.360]  but it's still the fact is that if you are as you and i are alex believers that there is a wisdom
[02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:27.840]  in crowds that the that democracy is therefore important because everybody however little however
[02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:33.760]  unimportant the establishment thinks they are everybody has the same pencil the same cross
[02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:40.720]  they can put on that ballot paper and that just as anybody else is that's the way democracy works
[02:57:40.720 --> 02:57:46.880]  and you and i alex keep a firm grasp on that and i think to do him to do him credit so does
[02:57:46.880 --> 02:57:51.440]  donald trump and i'm not sure that george will does i think he's lost the plot this time i hear
[02:57:51.440 --> 02:57:56.160]  a real quick question one question this segment a few more in the next hb in femur region four
[02:57:56.160 --> 02:57:59.920]  former state that is you want to talk to lord bonkton about the new film go ahead hb
[02:58:01.520 --> 02:58:06.880]  uh yeah my wife and i went to see it last night and all they focused on was co2
[02:58:08.480 --> 02:58:14.480]  they never brought geoengineering into it uh they didn't get dane wiggington in there and
[02:58:14.480 --> 02:58:18.320]  we were just kind of disappointed in it yeah i'm worried about the globalist using geoengineering
[02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:22.080]  to cause bad weather and bring in tyranny lord bonkton overall though you're in that film what
[02:58:22.080 --> 02:58:26.960]  do you think they're trying to censor it yes i mean i i i did take part in the film i also
[02:58:26.960 --> 02:58:31.760]  went to the premiere in paris which was a great event i think it's a great film because the fact
[02:58:31.760 --> 02:58:37.760]  is that the main thrust of the battle that we still have to fight is to convince as many people
[02:58:37.760 --> 02:58:41.440]  as sure just prove the science sorry to cut you off i'm sorry to be harsh the science
[02:58:41.440 --> 02:58:45.520]  public policy not a work stay there sir we're back in 60 seconds 70 seconds lord bonkton
[02:58:45.520 --> 02:58:49.840]  straight ahead i'll be able to finish that question take more hb you can't cover everything but i hear
[02:58:49.840 --> 02:58:58.160]  you thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the
[02:58:58.160 --> 02:59:05.200]  drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years
[02:59:05.200 --> 02:59:11.600]  ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own
[02:59:11.600 --> 02:59:17.360]  air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war
[02:59:17.360 --> 02:59:22.160]  pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of plastics that destroy our
[02:59:22.160 --> 02:59:28.720]  vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death i personally counter this
[02:59:28.720 --> 02:59:36.560]  onslaught with antroplex antroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create
[02:59:36.560 --> 02:59:42.480]  the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body discover why
[02:59:42.480 --> 02:59:47.680]  antroplex has turned so many heads today it's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands
[02:59:47.680 --> 03:00:17.520]  and it starts at info wars life dot com with antroplex you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:17.680 --> 03:00:37.680]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance lie from austin texas broadcasting
[03:00:37.680 --> 03:00:44.400]  worldwide it's alex jones there was one about this broadcast our guests our listeners our
[03:00:44.400 --> 03:00:49.040]  our reporters are as real as it gets i'm very honored and humbled to be here in the last five
[03:00:49.040 --> 03:00:54.240]  minutes we have lord mongin and paul watson comes in for the fourth hour a fresh horse a big brain
[03:00:54.240 --> 03:00:59.600]  in the fight for liberty straight ahead i'll take phone calls with lord mongin science and public
[03:00:59.600 --> 03:01:05.360]  policy dot org and he's right the sciences where it's all that that's where you win this thing or
[03:01:05.360 --> 03:01:10.480]  lose it and they are scared right now ron ron go ahead lord mongin finish your point that we're
[03:01:10.480 --> 03:01:14.800]  going to run and wash and go ahead when we're making is a sound one that there's a lot of nonsense
[03:01:14.800 --> 03:01:20.640]  being talked about the need to do geoengineering the fact is all such pre schemes are far more
[03:01:20.640 --> 03:01:25.840]  dangerous than global warming would ever be they're also far more expensive are they just boondoggles
[03:01:25.840 --> 03:01:30.720]  they probably wouldn't work either are they just boondoggles with these guys get billions to play
[03:01:30.720 --> 03:01:37.440]  savior of the earth that is exactly what it's all about and the time for these frauds to continue
[03:01:37.440 --> 03:01:43.280]  is now drawing to a close as our fraud investigation team starts getting its teeth into the worst of
[03:01:43.280 --> 03:01:49.040]  these fraudsters and bringing them actually into the court one by one that's the way to deal with
[03:01:49.040 --> 03:01:54.480]  criminality in the scientific sphere these scientists have got to understand they are no longer above
[03:01:54.480 --> 03:01:58.960]  the law just because they wear white coats with leaky virus by the way i was having you on ten
[03:01:58.960 --> 03:02:02.880]  years ago and you weren't this positive i mean we're not cheerleading here and we're still in deep
[03:02:02.880 --> 03:02:08.400]  trouble but i mean there's some major success happening we are winning now the the the the
[03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:15.840]  movement as far as the the science is concerned the climate official line has collapsed there's
[03:02:15.840 --> 03:02:22.160]  no longer any way to shore it up the growing discrepancy between what they said would happen
[03:02:22.160 --> 03:02:26.480]  and the far lesser rate of warming that has happened this is something that they can no
[03:02:26.480 --> 03:02:32.480]  longer deny well i want to stand the way human progress control all of our energy and play god
[03:02:32.480 --> 03:02:37.920]  like communist handing out sausages and bread and moscow in 1970 i mean it's just so exciting to see
[03:02:37.920 --> 03:02:41.920]  them in trouble and nobody deserves more credit than you lord bonkton i know you don't want it
[03:02:41.920 --> 03:02:45.520]  but here here's the lord bonkton folks that's all toast to him right now
[03:02:45.520 --> 03:02:50.240]  metaphysically uh to the truth and standing up and being proven right in the end a true example
[03:02:50.240 --> 03:02:54.720]  for us are uh lord christopher bonkton science and public policy dot org i got loaded full
[03:02:54.720 --> 03:02:59.440]  on us we only got time for one more before paul watson ron in washington state you're on the
[03:02:59.440 --> 03:03:06.880]  air with lord bonkton go ahead two quick points one the problem is in co2 excess it's it's all to
[03:03:07.920 --> 03:03:12.640]  minimalize there's too little oxygen in the world right now that's point one point two
[03:03:13.920 --> 03:03:18.880]  why don't you in the same time you cause these individuals to stand justice for fraud
[03:03:18.880 --> 03:03:24.480]  repo them at the same time because of their their profit is of course a very good option
[03:03:24.480 --> 03:03:30.000]  and we are looking at that because we get triple damages um if the court awards damages so
[03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:34.960]  that's certainly a thing that we are looking at sure because the standard deal but don't we need
[03:03:34.960 --> 03:03:39.600]  don't we need though more more carbon more more oxygen more carbon i mean aren't we in a starve
[03:03:39.600 --> 03:03:44.720]  level right now yes we are we need more carbon dioxide and to answer the the first question
[03:03:44.720 --> 03:03:50.640]  at point which is about is there too little oxygen when joseph priestly first discovered oxygen he
[03:03:50.640 --> 03:03:55.520]  was able to measure its content in the atmosphere quite accurately two or three hundred years ago
[03:03:55.520 --> 03:04:02.800]  at 20.67 percent and if you were to measure it today it is still 20.67 percent so don't
[03:04:02.800 --> 03:04:08.240]  worry the oxygen isn't running out oh god plenty of plants and trees the co2 is fertilizing them
[03:04:08.240 --> 03:04:14.080]  and they are therefore producing oxygen very happily and so we can all breathe safely at night
[03:04:14.080 --> 03:04:19.520]  but it is an incredible trace gas we live off of i mean thank god for it well of course oxygen
[03:04:19.520 --> 03:04:26.240]  isn't a trace gas co2 is a trace gas and that is really low compared to life on earth all animal
[03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:32.560]  life on earth and all plant life on earth absolutely depends on co2 and the idea of demonizing it
[03:04:32.560 --> 03:04:37.120]  is one of the left stupidest mistakes look at the left symbol the peace symbols a symbol of death
[03:04:37.760 --> 03:04:43.680]  on this as on everything it's simply wrong scientifically speaking and objectively speaking
[03:04:43.680 --> 03:04:49.040]  it's simply wrong most of them know it now and they're all trying to work out their escape route
[03:04:49.040 --> 03:04:53.360]  for some of them that will be very great job lord mongton congratulations we salute you
[03:04:54.640 --> 03:05:00.640]  thank you lord mongton job less whole watch is coming out of the bullpen into the gates right now
[03:05:01.600 --> 03:05:07.360]  joe biggs here with info wars com with some patriotic quotes by ron paul the most basic
[03:05:07.360 --> 03:05:13.760]  principle to being a free american is the notion that we as individuals are responsible for our own
[03:05:13.760 --> 03:05:19.600]  lives and decisions we do not have the right to rob our neighbors to make up for our own mistakes
[03:05:19.600 --> 03:05:25.200]  neither does our neighbor have any right to tell us how to live so long as we aren't infringing on
[03:05:25.200 --> 03:05:30.640]  their rights freedom to make bad decisions is inherent in the freedom to make good ones if we
[03:05:30.640 --> 03:05:36.800]  are only free to make good decisions then we are not really free liberty is lost through complacency
[03:05:36.800 --> 03:05:42.800]  and a subservient mindset when we accept or even welcome automobile checkpoints random searches
[03:05:42.800 --> 03:05:49.360]  mandatory identification cards and paramilitary police in our streets we have lost a vital part

[03:08:24.080 --> 03:08:33.360]  we're live at the 4th hour of the alex jones show with me your host paul joseph watson at the bottom
[03:08:33.360 --> 03:08:39.840]  of the hour we're going to be talking to richard reeves specifically about that amazing incident
[03:08:39.840 --> 03:08:46.560]  yesterday in indiana where ted cruise was confronted by a heckler the media are calling him a
[03:08:46.560 --> 03:08:52.960]  trump protester ted cruise basically got owned of course he's completely desperate now if he
[03:08:52.960 --> 03:08:57.760]  fails in indiana to take enough delegates off trump which it looks like he will indeed
[03:08:57.760 --> 03:09:03.280]  fail to do then he's basically finished they're talking about rumors of him suspending his
[03:09:03.280 --> 03:09:10.880]  campaign later this week so could this confrontation between ted cruise and this protester in indiana
[03:09:10.880 --> 03:09:17.440]  have been a set up a provocation a planned event not something that just naturally occurred
[03:09:17.440 --> 03:09:21.600]  from the very beginning we're going to talk to richard reeves because he's been around
[03:09:21.600 --> 03:09:26.880]  in and around these primaries he's tried to get access to ted cruise and he basically says it's
[03:09:26.880 --> 03:09:33.200]  the hardest thing imaginable and yet somehow we get this spontaneous confrontation between
[03:09:33.200 --> 03:09:40.960]  cruise and this pro trump anti cruise protester whilst ted cruise trying to incite some act of
[03:09:40.960 --> 03:09:47.840]  violence or stage some kind of pr event when he partuck in this confrontation we're going to talk to
[03:09:47.840 --> 03:09:54.160]  richard reeves about that later because again it illustrates the desperation that cruise is now
[03:09:54.160 --> 03:10:00.240]  betraying as he heads into indiana with the polls firmly against him so we're going to get to that
[03:10:00.240 --> 03:10:04.960]  in the bottom of the hour but i want to start off with this because the fat pride movement
[03:10:05.600 --> 03:10:09.680]  and the unholy alliance between the fat pride movement and third wave feminism
[03:10:10.400 --> 03:10:14.960]  is something that i've delved into on many occasions in the past and in fact i've got a
[03:10:14.960 --> 03:10:21.920]  video coming out later today about this issue some of you will remember last year there was a
[03:10:21.920 --> 03:10:28.160]  supplier of protein products called protein world here in the united kingdom they came out with an
[03:10:28.160 --> 03:10:34.640]  ad which was basically a massive poster campaign slapped across subways billboards across the
[03:10:34.640 --> 03:10:43.520]  country and the ad said are you beach body ready behind a picture of a thin shapely woman
[03:10:43.520 --> 03:10:50.720]  again god forbid you would want to show somebody who was thin fertile and attractive in a bot in
[03:10:50.720 --> 03:10:57.120]  an ad which is about an aspirational goal of achieving a beach body god forbid you would
[03:10:57.120 --> 03:11:04.000]  want to do that as a company that sells protein products to help people try and achieve this
[03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:09.840]  level of fitness of course what happened was the poster campaign was completely defaced fat
[03:11:09.840 --> 03:11:16.400]  militant feminists spewed in outrage all over the shop they basically carried out bomb threats
[03:11:16.400 --> 03:11:22.400]  against protein world that happened and of course the media jumped right in and again it became
[03:11:22.400 --> 03:11:29.520]  about this issue of making fat pride and positive body positivity and indeed in some cases obesity
[03:11:29.520 --> 03:11:36.320]  a social justice cause rather than what it is in reality which is a chronic health problem
[03:11:36.320 --> 03:11:43.600]  which costs the national health service in the uk 16 billion dollars pounds i should say every
[03:11:43.600 --> 03:11:50.880]  single year more than smoking more than alcohol and yet again it's been turned with the aid of the
[03:11:50.880 --> 03:11:57.120]  leftist media narrative into a massive social justice cause so we're going to get into that
[03:11:57.120 --> 03:12:04.000]  because basically the fat pride movement as i've illustrated before is incredibly harmful to women
[03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:10.240]  which is why this bizarre alliance with feminism as we've seen makes no sense unless you understand
[03:12:10.240 --> 03:12:16.160]  that third wave feminism has nothing whatsoever to do with helping women it has everything to do
[03:12:16.160 --> 03:12:23.040]  with allowing these permanently offended constantly triggered militant fat feminists feel better
[03:12:23.040 --> 03:12:28.800]  about themselves to the detriment of everybody else to the detriment of women furthering their
[03:12:28.800 --> 03:12:36.800]  own careers by appearing in ads such as the protein world beach body ad by you know being
[03:12:36.800 --> 03:12:42.240]  grid girls being page three girls women actually having the choice whether you agree with it or
[03:12:42.240 --> 03:12:47.520]  not morally to do what they want with their own body you would think that would be an ideal
[03:12:47.520 --> 03:12:54.480]  supported by feminists but in every single case it's not again they tried to ban the athena tennis
[03:12:54.480 --> 03:13:01.120]  girl poster last year every single example where a woman chooses to use her good looks her body to
[03:13:01.120 --> 03:13:06.800]  get ahead in life they clamp down on it at every single turn and we're seeing that again with
[03:13:08.480 --> 03:13:13.200]  these ads the beach body ad which we saw last year and similar ones in future because the
[03:13:13.200 --> 03:13:21.040]  business insider is reporting the uk's ad regulator is cracking down on adverts that stereotype
[03:13:21.040 --> 03:13:28.080]  women the uk's advertising watchdog is launching a formal investigation into quote gender stereotyping
[03:13:28.080 --> 03:13:33.520]  in advertising now this is the advertising standards authority this is the official body
[03:13:33.520 --> 03:13:41.200]  that regulates advertising and has the power to ban certain imagery in advertising so now
[03:13:41.200 --> 03:13:47.760]  they're talking about basically banning thin attractive women to please permanently offended
[03:13:47.760 --> 03:13:54.480]  fat militant feminists off the back of last year's protein world controversy now listen to what the
[03:13:54.480 --> 03:14:02.080]  head of this agency guy parker said he said that the agency plans to ban ads that quote cause offense
[03:14:03.280 --> 03:14:08.320]  so if any small number of organized militant fringe extremists which is what the fat pride
[03:14:08.320 --> 03:14:13.200]  movement is decides that they're offended by something they will complain and that ad will be
[03:14:13.200 --> 03:14:19.920]  banned again this is another example of them seizing power simply off the platform of being
[03:14:19.920 --> 03:14:26.640]  offended or claiming to be offended but this is being done in the name of quote equality
[03:14:27.760 --> 03:14:31.920]  again parker said the ban was a result of the increasing political and public debate
[03:14:31.920 --> 03:14:39.440]  on equality issues yet what will this new round of regulation address well according to him it will
[03:14:39.440 --> 03:14:49.840]  address quote the objectification and sexualization of women in ads not of men and women just of just
[03:14:49.840 --> 03:14:55.920]  of women so of course it's going to be completely fine for Cristiano Ronaldo to parade around in his
[03:14:55.920 --> 03:15:01.920]  tight underwear for our money but god forbid you would want to show an attractive thin model on
[03:15:01.920 --> 03:15:09.520]  the front of a beach body ad that will be banned to appease militant fat permanently outraged feminists
[03:15:09.520 --> 03:15:16.240]  this is what's happening in the uk again just one small example of how they gain control of media
[03:15:16.240 --> 03:15:23.760]  simply by being offended and again this is about the fat pride movement proving what it is which
[03:15:23.760 --> 03:15:30.320]  is a detriment to women this is all based around the fact that feminists are basically inflicting
[03:15:30.320 --> 03:15:36.240]  their self loathing on other women the stereotype is generally true i don't know if you've noticed
[03:15:37.120 --> 03:15:44.000]  but most of them aren't too hot they tend to be social and sexual failures with bizarre multicolored
[03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:52.960]  hair not too attractive and in many cases grossly overweight we've all seen the legend of triglypuff
[03:15:52.960 --> 03:15:59.600]  and now that's percolating down into them actually trying to ban the use of pretty women
[03:15:59.600 --> 03:16:05.840]  in adverts and that could be dismissed as some fringe radical belief you know tumblr twitter
[03:16:05.840 --> 03:16:11.120]  feminists screeching once again why don't you just ignore them they have no power well this is yet
[03:16:11.120 --> 03:16:18.000]  another example they have power they're taking over certain sectors of the media when we know
[03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:25.360]  that they're taking over certain sectors of university campuses with the complete myth bs college
[03:16:25.360 --> 03:16:31.760]  rape culture that they've invented which now at the university of massachusetts which is where last
[03:16:31.760 --> 03:16:38.560]  weeks the triggering event happened where the the triglypuff meltdown occurred now i'm getting
[03:16:38.560 --> 03:16:44.160]  messages from students at that university who say that male students who basically just go
[03:16:44.160 --> 03:16:51.840]  to a party just show up to a party and merely look at a woman in a way that's not appreciated
[03:16:51.840 --> 03:16:58.080]  you know gaze rape they call it in some cases those female students again hopped up on this
[03:16:58.080 --> 03:17:03.680]  militant feminism are reporting them for sexual assault simply for looking at them
[03:17:04.320 --> 03:17:10.000]  that's what some of the in this case a female student at the university of massachusetts told me
[03:17:10.000 --> 03:17:16.080]  just a few days ago in the aftermath of this triggering event where now the social justice
[03:17:16.080 --> 03:17:22.640]  warriors who got denounced who got called out by steven grouder by milo unopolis by christina
[03:17:22.640 --> 03:17:27.920]  hoffsummers are now complaining claiming that their safe spaces were violated and actually
[03:17:27.920 --> 03:17:35.600]  talking about suing people for having a different opinion so they're crushing free speech or attempting
[03:17:35.600 --> 03:17:42.640]  to at the university level they're imposing censorship at the media level in terms of advertising
[03:17:42.640 --> 03:17:47.760]  and this is just the latest round of that so again i've got a big video on that coming out later
[03:17:48.480 --> 03:17:55.200]  proving once again that feminism is harmful to women not only in pushing body positivity
[03:17:55.760 --> 03:18:01.280]  and saying that obese people shouldn't just embrace it even though it's linked with all manner of
[03:18:01.280 --> 03:18:07.280]  horrible life shortening diseases but now they're basically going to put good-looking attractive
[03:18:07.280 --> 03:18:13.680]  women who have worked hard out of work simply because they're triggered by their appearance
[03:18:13.680 --> 03:18:20.240]  because again in most cases these people aren't too hot they don't take responsibility for their
[03:18:20.240 --> 03:18:26.320]  own horrible lifestyle choices so instead of them having to own up to that and get on an
[03:18:27.200 --> 03:18:33.840]  exercise bike or go running in the park no it's society that has to cater for it it's
[03:18:33.840 --> 03:18:39.760]  airlines that have to widen seats to accommodate obese people not obese people having to lose
[03:18:39.760 --> 03:18:44.640]  weight and if you dare suggest that losing weight might be a good idea well maybe that's a hate crime
[03:18:45.360 --> 03:18:49.280]  maybe you're going to get sued for having that opinion and your ads are going to get
[03:18:49.280 --> 03:18:55.920]  banned and boycotted as we saw with protein world what actually happened is that protein world
[03:18:55.920 --> 03:19:02.000]  refused to apologize which most people don't get that that is the ultimate and only way of defeating
[03:19:02.000 --> 03:19:08.720]  these social justice warriors never back down never cave in they refused to do so they made
[03:19:09.440 --> 03:19:14.800]  about a million pounds more than they would have expected simply because of all the free publicity
[03:19:14.800 --> 03:19:21.920]  and they then they launched the exact same huge billboard campaign in new york city so again an
[03:19:21.920 --> 03:19:28.960]  example to anyone else who is the victim of this outrage culture never back down never apologize
[03:19:28.960 --> 03:19:35.520]  but in the case of the asa the uk advertising standards authority they have caved into fat
[03:19:35.520 --> 03:19:41.600]  militant feminists and in their own words they're talking about censoring the objectification of
[03:19:41.600 --> 03:19:47.920]  women which as you saw with the protein world example is basically thin attractive women
[03:19:47.920 --> 03:19:54.240]  but it's not going to apply for men proving again that it has nothing to do with equality
[03:19:54.240 --> 03:19:59.200]  we'll be back after this break on the fourth hour overdrive of the alex joneshow breaking news

[03:24:27.040 --> 03:24:34.640]  segment to talk about that confrontation between ted cruise and the pro trump protester in indiana
[03:24:34.640 --> 03:24:41.600]  was it stage was it a setup was it an attempt on behalf of the cruise campaign to provoke
[03:24:41.600 --> 03:24:47.840]  these trump protesters and to create some kind of incident which they could then use to again
[03:24:47.840 --> 03:24:55.120]  peddle this media narrative that trump supporters are violent when of course in every single example
[03:24:55.120 --> 03:25:00.960]  that we've documented over and over again it's the leftist bernie sanders supporters who are
[03:25:00.960 --> 03:25:06.800]  spitting in people's faces punching them in the face kicking them on the ground defacing vehicles
[03:25:07.520 --> 03:25:12.400]  all manner of civil unrest and riotous behavior that we've seen over the past couple of months
[03:25:12.400 --> 03:25:18.400]  again the media continues to blame it on donald trump was that confrontation an attempt to
[03:25:18.960 --> 03:25:24.640]  contrive some kind of similar incident richard reeves is going to give us the inside take on
[03:25:24.640 --> 03:25:29.280]  that because he's been around the ted cruise campaign so that's coming up in the next segment
[03:25:29.920 --> 03:25:33.920]  but i wanted to flash back to this quote and we've got a video clip coming up in a second
[03:25:34.560 --> 03:25:42.000]  this is carl roe from 2004 and alex has included this quote in his documentary films before quote
[03:25:43.040 --> 03:25:49.520]  we're an empire now and when we act we create our own reality and while you're studying that
[03:25:49.520 --> 03:25:57.040]  reality judiciously as you will we'll act again creating other new realities which you can study
[03:25:57.040 --> 03:26:03.440]  too and that's how things will sort out we are history's actors and you all of you will be left
[03:26:03.440 --> 03:26:10.400]  to just study what we do so that was carl roe back in 2004 sounding pretty confident
[03:26:11.520 --> 03:26:18.160]  on the notion that he and the establishment the elite in general were able to craft reality
[03:26:18.160 --> 03:26:25.840]  completely outside of the notion of any objective reality and that is particularly relevant when
[03:26:25.840 --> 03:26:33.040]  it comes to the donald trump campaign given what carl roe said about donald trump as recently as
[03:26:33.040 --> 03:26:40.560]  july last year let's go to that clip i do think there are sort of three tiers of candidates
[03:26:40.560 --> 03:26:50.000]  there are three candidates who in reverse alphabetical order walker rubio bush or alphabetical order
[03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:59.360]  bush rubio walker or inside out order rubio walker bush or rubio bush walker that's the top tier
[03:27:00.720 --> 03:27:06.880]  we're likely to see the nominee come out of that group we have a second tier which includes people
[03:27:06.880 --> 03:27:14.880]  like ted cruz and yellow perry and then karson and maybe a couple of others and one or two you
[03:27:14.880 --> 03:27:19.360]  don't wonder if my type could be rick santel maybe one of those gets into the top tier
[03:27:21.040 --> 03:27:25.120]  but right now they're on the second tier and then we've got sort of the third tier which are people
[03:27:25.120 --> 03:27:31.200]  who really are unlikely to break through they're good people some of them but they're unlikely to
[03:27:31.200 --> 03:27:39.200]  break through or in the case of donald trump they're completely idiots
[03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:46.640]  that was carl roe back in july last year saying basically that donald trump had no chance whatsoever
[03:27:47.200 --> 03:27:53.520]  he was a third tier candidate and that rubio walker and bush would be the top tier candidates
[03:27:53.520 --> 03:27:59.600]  all of whom of course have dropped out their campaigns ending in complete failure well it
[03:27:59.600 --> 03:28:06.720]  appears that carl roe is not so good at creating reality anymore and in fact he has turned out
[03:28:06.720 --> 03:28:14.560]  to be the complete idiot because this is out political.com poll trump up to 56% nationally now
[03:28:14.560 --> 03:28:20.240]  of course yesterday we had rasmussen come out and say that trump was ahead of hillary clinton in a
[03:28:20.240 --> 03:28:26.240]  hypothetical head to head for the first time among some estimates of course we had the
[03:28:26.240 --> 03:28:31.520]  narrative that it's impossible for trump to beat hillary the only candidates that could beat hillary
[03:28:31.520 --> 03:28:38.880]  were case itch and cruise now that's being overturned so political reports donald trump reached a new
[03:28:38.880 --> 03:28:45.200]  high among republicans in a national mbc news poll released tuesday the real estate mogul has 56%
[03:28:45.200 --> 03:28:51.760]  support more than doubling his advantage over ted cruise who sits at 22% case it rounds out the
[03:28:51.760 --> 03:28:57.600]  survey with 14% support and additional 7% remain undecided and of course in that poll yesterday
[03:28:57.600 --> 03:29:04.640]  rasmussen you had 89% of republicans saying basically that they were comfortable with
[03:29:04.640 --> 03:29:09.920]  donald trump being the candidate there's very little enthusiasm amongst republican voters
[03:29:09.920 --> 03:29:16.640]  for this brokered convention we have another poll this is gateway pundit trump jumps to 34
[03:29:16.640 --> 03:29:22.080]  point lead in california after violent leftists and mexicans riot outside trump rally so again
[03:29:22.080 --> 03:29:29.200]  yet another poll in which donald trump is leaping ahead confounding claims that he's a complete loser
[03:29:29.200 --> 03:29:37.440]  made by call row back in 2004 who seems unable or incapable of crafting that reality which
[03:29:37.440 --> 03:29:43.200]  he bragged about so much back 12 years ago we're going to be back after the break with richard
[03:29:43.200 --> 03:29:47.760]  reeves talking about that confrontation between cruise and the pro trump protesters this is the
[03:29:47.760 --> 03:29:56.800]  alex jones show live don't go away we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn
[03:29:56.800 --> 03:30:08.000]  radio network a warning to the united states from the government of saudi arabia release the 28 pages
[03:30:08.000 --> 03:30:15.440]  in face an economic collapse there is a federal lawsuit that could reveal the contents of the 28
[03:30:15.440 --> 03:30:21.280]  still classified pages of the 9 11 commission report and in it there is compelling evidence
[03:30:21.280 --> 03:30:27.120]  that links saudi officials to the 9 11 hijackers according to the new york times if the bill to
[03:30:27.120 --> 03:30:33.280]  release the 28 pages is passed it would clear a path for the role of the saudi government to be
[03:30:33.280 --> 03:30:38.480]  examined in the september 11 attacks well that's something that should have happened a long time
[03:30:38.480 --> 03:30:45.520]  ago and wouldn't you know it obama just like george w wants the 28 pages kept secret even though
[03:30:45.520 --> 03:30:51.280]  saudi involvement in 9 11 should have been considered an act of war in the recent threats
[03:30:51.280 --> 03:30:58.000]  to destroy our economy yet another act of terrorism by the government of saudi arabia you can learn

[03:33:27.920 --> 03:33:33.280]  of the alex jones show now of course yesterday we saw this amazing confrontation between ted
[03:33:33.280 --> 03:33:41.360]  crews and a pro trump protester which the media is calling a heckler in indiana basically crews
[03:33:41.360 --> 03:33:46.160]  went up to and tried to stage some kind of incident we're going to get into some speculation on what
[03:33:46.160 --> 03:33:51.200]  might have happened behind that here with richard reeves in a moment but basically cruise is trying
[03:33:51.200 --> 03:33:56.400]  to ask the trump protester and we played the video early in the earlier in the show you know why he
[03:33:56.400 --> 03:34:03.360]  supports donald trump and of course lying ted being lying ted told a bunch of lies once again
[03:34:03.360 --> 03:34:10.080]  now of course crews told the protester quote he's not going to build the wall and he's not going
[03:34:10.080 --> 03:34:16.960]  to deport anyone and he claimed that this is what trump in a secret interview told the new
[03:34:16.960 --> 03:34:23.360]  york times editorial board of course there's no evidence that actually happened in fact the new
[03:34:23.360 --> 03:34:29.360]  york times itself said quote it's not as if we are sitting on a news story here or holding something
[03:34:29.360 --> 03:34:35.840]  or holding something back from publication so the new york times itself basically intimated
[03:34:35.840 --> 03:34:42.720]  that trump ever said that and yet cruise states it as an assertion of fact he's not going to build
[03:34:42.720 --> 03:34:48.080]  the wall he's not going to deport anyone that's what cruise said that trump told the new york times
[03:34:48.080 --> 03:34:55.360]  it never happened also and we played the video again earlier cruise said that trump said he'd
[03:34:55.360 --> 03:35:02.640]  cut a deal with chuck schumer to quote take away your second amendment of course again another
[03:35:02.640 --> 03:35:10.000]  complete bold face lie what trump actually said was that he could cut a deal with schumer in a general
[03:35:10.000 --> 03:35:16.560]  sense the issue of the second amendment the issue of gun control never came up so even in trying to
[03:35:17.520 --> 03:35:23.840]  imply that donald trump was a liar in that confrontation ted cruise told two more
[03:35:23.840 --> 03:35:31.760]  or flagrant lies again it completely backfired at the end of the confrontation ted cruise is
[03:35:31.760 --> 03:35:36.480]  doing all these dramatic pauses you know he's not actually trying to talk to people in a
[03:35:36.480 --> 03:35:42.640]  normal conversation he's acting like he's giving a speech at the national press club or c pack
[03:35:42.640 --> 03:35:48.720]  so he keeps pausing between saying his words which gives the protesters the chance to jump in and
[03:35:48.720 --> 03:35:55.520]  then ted cruise basically says what is the real question and they respond are you from canada
[03:35:55.520 --> 03:36:01.600]  and everybody just laughs out loud again completely backfired yet it appears that this could have
[03:36:01.600 --> 03:36:09.360]  been a last ditch desperate measure by ted cruise to stage some kind of incident now we've got
[03:36:09.360 --> 03:36:16.080]  up on info wars dot com tiny crowd greets crews in indiana crews can't even reach capacity of
[03:36:16.080 --> 03:36:22.160]  small venues go and look at these pictures and then compare them to the donald trump rallies
[03:36:22.800 --> 03:36:29.120]  he's basically finished we've got dc whispers reporting crews preparing to suspend campaign
[03:36:29.120 --> 03:36:35.280]  this week again his sources this is a washington insider suggesting that if he performs poorly
[03:36:35.280 --> 03:36:41.360]  in indiana which the polls suggest he will cruise could suspend his campaign he could give up on
[03:36:41.360 --> 03:36:46.160]  the idea of a broken convention altogether so this is how desperate the cruise campaign is
[03:36:46.720 --> 03:36:52.560]  going into indiana which is interesting that it coincides with this confrontation which seemingly
[03:36:52.560 --> 03:36:57.280]  came out of nowhere now we've got richard reeves on the line he of course has been reporting for
[03:36:57.280 --> 03:37:04.960]  info wars at least primary events he's noted how almost nigh on impossible it is to get access to
[03:37:04.960 --> 03:37:12.880]  ted cruise and yet suddenly spontaneously cruise is having a conversation with in some cases these
[03:37:12.880 --> 03:37:20.240]  ira pro trump protesters so richard welcome to the show hey paul thanks for bringing me in real
[03:37:20.240 --> 03:37:24.800]  quick on the last minute yes i just had to report this today it's his election day in indiana so
[03:37:24.800 --> 03:37:28.320]  it's super important to get this out we'll get to richard in a second but again you go up on
[03:37:28.320 --> 03:37:33.840]  info wars dot com tiny crowds greek crews in indiana what had cruise is only attracting
[03:37:33.840 --> 03:37:40.240]  tiny crowds of people to his features in indiana indicating his campaign is facing complete collapse
[03:37:40.880 --> 03:37:46.640]  and there's a bunch of tweets here with the pictures basically he can't even fill a quarter
[03:37:46.640 --> 03:37:53.360]  of a small auditorium you compare that to the size of the trump crowds standing room only
[03:37:55.360 --> 03:38:00.240]  you know ted cruise is completely finished he's getting desperate which is interesting that it
[03:38:00.240 --> 03:38:06.160]  coincides with this confrontation which seems to have been staged let's talk to richard Reeves
[03:38:06.160 --> 03:38:11.920]  about it richard you've been on the campaign trail there at the primaries you've tried to access the
[03:38:12.480 --> 03:38:18.640]  cruise in a circle you've noted how difficult it is and yet suddenly you have this spontaneous
[03:38:18.640 --> 03:38:26.080]  confrontation seems a little contrived don't you think absolutely 100 contrived paul i saw that
[03:38:26.080 --> 03:38:32.880]  last night on fox and it's like whoa that doesn't happen that way and what what it is is basically
[03:38:32.880 --> 03:38:38.320]  you know i've been on the campaign trail starting back in december uh i confronted ted cruise to
[03:38:38.320 --> 03:38:43.600]  invite him on the alex jones show numerous times live in person and through surrogates but to get
[03:38:43.600 --> 03:38:48.640]  to the live and in person basically your best opportunity normally to ted cruise is you have
[03:38:48.640 --> 03:38:53.360]  to wait for a chance at the rope line uh you know his surrogates really won't help you necessarily
[03:38:53.360 --> 03:38:58.880]  unless you're a big abc mbc affiliate something like that they they basically just oh you give me
[03:38:58.880 --> 03:39:03.280]  your email and phone number and that's it so basically you got to wait for the rope line and
[03:39:03.280 --> 03:39:07.920]  matt webber right there in our production studio can attest to this he was my cameraman on some of
[03:39:07.920 --> 03:39:14.480]  these trips that we made to see ted cruise so anyway so bottom line is uh even if you go let's
[03:39:14.480 --> 03:39:18.720]  say to the back of a venue it could be a small venue it could be a small civic center or something
[03:39:18.720 --> 03:39:25.280]  like that well basically the secret service and or whoever the security security team that ted
[03:39:25.280 --> 03:39:29.520]  cruise was using i don't know for sure if it was secret service it appeared to be to me but
[03:39:29.520 --> 03:39:34.640]  anyway they would actually make sure that the back entrance area the entrance area where ted
[03:39:34.640 --> 03:39:39.600]  cruise would come in would be totally secured you couldn't be back there because i tried i tried to
[03:39:39.600 --> 03:39:44.320]  go back in the back to be able to have a minute or two conversation a question and back and forth
[03:39:44.320 --> 03:39:50.080]  with him no way jose was that going to happen so when i saw that clip yesterday i thought wow
[03:39:50.080 --> 03:39:56.000]  that is totally not spontaneous because what i'm sure he did is he looked around at some venue i
[03:39:56.000 --> 03:40:02.160]  wish we could get all 100 of the details but he clearly looked around and found some from supporters
[03:40:02.160 --> 03:40:08.960]  and he didn't go to the mainstream guys he went to guys that had been in w o uh you know soft killed
[03:40:08.960 --> 03:40:13.920]  heavily i myself am heavily soft killed to what degree i don't know but all of us are soft killed
[03:40:13.920 --> 03:40:19.680]  some degree so he selected some intimidating looking trump supporters that have been you know
[03:40:19.680 --> 03:40:26.080]  had a little extra soft killed unto him so he clearly in my view was trying to provoke a punch
[03:40:26.080 --> 03:40:30.800]  to be thrown i had no doubt about that and by the way glenn beck was with him in that incident
[03:40:30.800 --> 03:40:35.520]  because i was monitoring the enemy transmission today by glenn beck and he says oh yeah ted
[03:40:35.520 --> 03:40:40.640]  cruise walked across the street to confront these trump supporters so there's corroboration right
[03:40:40.640 --> 03:40:45.600]  now these trump supporters didn't necessarily seek ted cruise out he was cherry picking and
[03:40:45.600 --> 03:40:50.480]  finding it's just like we see with mainstream left stream media where there could be a protest about
[03:40:50.480 --> 03:40:57.680]  some super legitimate valid issue but who did the mainstream guys look to find to be the uh
[03:40:57.680 --> 03:41:02.800]  you know the proponents or the the spokespersons spokespersons for that cause they'll find somebody
[03:41:02.800 --> 03:41:09.440]  that you know not necessarily mainstream america can identify with so it looks like it was a deliberate
[03:41:09.440 --> 03:41:14.320]  decision by the cruise campaigns to go and confront these protesters like you said they
[03:41:14.320 --> 03:41:19.600]  picked some of the less intelligent the more aggressive ones they kind of calmed down after
[03:41:19.600 --> 03:41:25.120]  cruise was was talking to them for a couple of minutes and yet still cruise ended up getting
[03:41:25.120 --> 03:41:31.200]  owned because he tried to make how he tried to impugn donald trump by grilling these individuals
[03:41:31.200 --> 03:41:37.840]  on why they support donald trump but in the process he only exposed himself to be a liar because he
[03:41:37.840 --> 03:41:42.320]  he said that trump told the new york times editorial board in this secret interview
[03:41:42.320 --> 03:41:46.800]  that's so explosive the new york times says there's basically nothing to it and they're not even
[03:41:46.800 --> 03:41:51.280]  going to release it that trump said quote he's not going to build the wall he's not going to
[03:41:51.280 --> 03:41:57.360]  deport anyone there's no evidence that trump ever said that so even in the act of trying to impugn
[03:41:57.360 --> 03:42:04.080]  trump as a liar ted cruise only proves himself to be a massive liar it only backfired didn't it
[03:42:04.080 --> 03:42:08.880]  it yes it backfired and i'll tell you what that that's probably gonna backfire on him but you
[03:42:08.880 --> 03:42:13.920]  know he tried it that's what's worrisome is that we got to watch out for these stage false like you
[03:42:13.920 --> 03:42:19.600]  know the new world order the powers to be are just chomping at the bit for trump supporters to appear
[03:42:19.600 --> 03:42:24.640]  violent in any manner you know it's just like in the upcoming general election whenever we see
[03:42:24.640 --> 03:42:28.320]  trump get this nomination they're probably going to replay that one guy from north carolina that
[03:42:28.320 --> 03:42:35.280]  old older gentleman the 70 plus year old that took a swipe at the at the black lives matter kid
[03:42:35.280 --> 03:42:38.400]  and they're probably gonna play that we're gonna probably see that a million times it'll probably
[03:42:38.400 --> 03:42:43.440]  be bigger than uh you know you name it the shot across the world the punch across the world whatever
[03:42:43.440 --> 03:42:49.520]  punch you know that across the world so yeah he got caught in more lies he got caught in that
[03:42:49.520 --> 03:42:54.800]  and i'll tell you paul one thing that we noticed and we reported on it last tuesday was in that
[03:42:54.800 --> 03:42:59.280]  the five state the acela primary where he had connecticut rhoda island philvania maryland
[03:42:59.280 --> 03:43:05.520]  delaware we noticed ted cruz had dropped down into uh you know barely over 10 percent 10 11
[03:43:05.520 --> 03:43:10.800]  12 percent i think his highest state i think he got 19 20 percent in his highest state out of the
[03:43:10.800 --> 03:43:17.120]  five last last week so really a big key turning point was and we called it last tuesday by pointing
[03:43:17.120 --> 03:43:24.160]  out those numbers is when he teamed up with kasek to try to play indiana in his favor to get people
[03:43:24.160 --> 03:43:28.880]  not to vote for kasek and indiana and come over and vote for him and also the states of oregon
[03:43:28.880 --> 03:43:34.080]  and that they're playing games with oregon and new mexico so that was a key point when we saw
[03:43:34.080 --> 03:43:41.040]  trump zoom up to that 60 level in those five states it was expected we see 50 or 60 in new york
[03:43:41.040 --> 03:43:46.160]  but those acela states the five states that came up last tuesday that was really big and i think
[03:43:46.160 --> 03:43:50.160]  that showed the beginning of the end to ted cruz and so now we've seen him make more and more
[03:43:50.160 --> 03:43:55.200]  mistakes and i'll tell you what with today being such a pivotal day with indiana we just absolutely
[03:43:55.200 --> 03:44:01.120]  had to get this story out ted cruz knew that this would be on mainstream press and look even though
[03:44:01.120 --> 03:44:06.080]  there was no physical altercation he still succeeded on getting that coverage well how much of that
[03:44:06.080 --> 03:44:10.240]  type of coverage have you seen him talking with trans supporters before you know it's right now
[03:44:10.240 --> 03:44:16.880]  on the eve of indiana you see it finally no he just seems to be lurching from one disaster to
[03:44:16.880 --> 03:44:22.800]  another do you think that if he performs poorly in indiana that basically he's gonna he's gonna
[03:44:22.800 --> 03:44:29.200]  fold or is he is he gonna drag it on to a brokered convention well i'm gonna make a video on this
[03:44:29.200 --> 03:44:34.400]  later and give a full update on that but basically i think if ted cruz gets whipped tonight at the
[03:44:34.400 --> 03:44:38.320]  polls which watch out for black box voting we know about that we'll have to watch for that
[03:44:38.320 --> 03:44:43.440]  but if he gets whipped tonight i think if it were only up to ted cruz i think he would do the right
[03:44:43.440 --> 03:44:49.840]  thing and step out but he's got people behind him the jeb bushes the bush family the neil bushes
[03:44:49.840 --> 03:44:54.640]  he's got g lp establishment people behind him uh but that's fractured too and i'll say i'll have
[03:44:54.640 --> 03:44:59.760]  more details in a different video on that so i think ted cruz alone would probably step out
[03:44:59.760 --> 03:45:05.280]  it's the people behind him it's the money powers behind him the n w l powers behind him they may
[03:45:05.280 --> 03:45:09.680]  say well sorry ted we don't care for you know if your political career gets ruined or whatever don't
[03:45:09.680 --> 03:45:15.760]  worry we'll put put plenty of money in your bank so i think that you know basically it's a toss up
[03:45:15.760 --> 03:45:20.240]  if it was up to ted he probably would but anyway time will tell we're about to find out tonight
[03:45:21.600 --> 03:45:27.520]  okay there goes richard reeves info wars reporter thanks for joining us richard thank you very much
[03:45:27.520 --> 03:45:31.840]  paul we'll see you guys later in some more videos and keep it up with info wars dot com
[03:45:33.040 --> 03:45:36.960]  okay there goes richard reeves and of course the top story on drudge right now
[03:45:36.960 --> 03:45:43.040]  this is out of zero hedge ted cruz explodes in epic anti trump ran his utterly amoral narcissist
[03:45:43.040 --> 03:45:49.040]  flandering pathological liar this is a quote from ted cruz he continues to double down quote
[03:45:49.680 --> 03:45:53.680]  this man is a pathological liar he doesn't know the difference between truth and lies
[03:45:55.600 --> 03:46:02.240]  cruz just told a massive whopper out there in public while he was trying to stage this incident
[03:46:02.240 --> 03:46:08.320]  to impute trump as a liar he said trump told the new york times he wasn't gonna build the wall
[03:46:08.320 --> 03:46:13.440]  he wasn't going to deport anyone trump never said that even though new york times said that
[03:46:13.440 --> 03:46:17.600]  he never said that because they they're not even going to publish the interview if it was that
[03:46:17.600 --> 03:46:23.520]  explosive they would publish it again there's no evidence that trump ever said that so in calling
[03:46:23.520 --> 03:46:30.880]  out trump for being a liar ted cruz continues to tell whopper after whopper and it's not looking too
[03:46:30.880 --> 03:46:36.960]  good for him given his poll numbers given his tiny crowds there's no enthusiasm behind him
[03:46:36.960 --> 03:46:43.200]  whatsoever there's no momentum and he's basically finished but again he's carrying the water for
[03:46:43.200 --> 03:46:49.120]  an establishment that wants to drag this onto the convention to try and screw trump to try and
[03:46:49.120 --> 03:46:55.760]  stab him in the front as they promised to do all along so we'll continue to track it let's go to
[03:46:55.760 --> 03:47:02.480]  this mark dies video now basically dice went out again to the beaches of san diego that hot spot of
[03:47:02.480 --> 03:47:08.960]  intelligence and you know not a lot of brain cells going around as we've documented in the past
[03:47:08.960 --> 03:47:15.280]  he basically asked millennials to show them the browsing history on their phones of course
[03:47:15.280 --> 03:47:21.360]  they don't care that the government's surveilling them they don't care that there's a location tracker
[03:47:21.360 --> 03:47:27.840]  on their iphone which most people don't even know exists that tells you that records every single
[03:47:27.840 --> 03:47:33.200]  location down to the exact street number where you've been they don't care about the government
[03:47:33.200 --> 03:47:40.080]  having that information they do care if you ask them to show you their google history let's go to
[03:47:40.080 --> 03:47:45.200]  this mark dies clip a lot of people don't care that the government is spying on everybody they

[03:47:50.960 --> 03:47:58.720]  no what do you have to hide i'm not even sure i have to think about it but there might be something
[03:48:00.000 --> 03:48:03.840]  if you don't have anything to hide i mean what are you worried about i mean just just open the
[03:48:03.840 --> 03:48:12.720]  google app and let me see what the no some recent no just want to see i want to see what you've been

[03:48:49.920 --> 03:48:54.080]  spying on everybody they say they don't have anything to hide so we're just seeing if you
[03:48:54.080 --> 03:48:58.000]  have anything to hide i would just like to take a quick look at your browser history to see what
[03:48:58.000 --> 03:49:03.760]  your most recent searches are please sorry i don't have time for this let me see the recent search
[03:49:03.760 --> 03:49:08.880]  history on your on the google app oh no no no no no what have you been searching that you're
[03:49:08.880 --> 03:49:14.320]  embarrassed i don't know that's my right that's my uh one of my amendments my right to privacy
[03:49:14.880 --> 03:49:20.160]  son of a that's why i'm asking for your permission come on show me what you've looked up
[03:49:20.960 --> 03:49:25.120]  what are you embarrassed so embarrassed about i don't know what i've been looking at let me see it

[03:49:37.680 --> 03:49:43.840]  that's why you won't let us do it so again the common refrain what do you have to hide
[03:49:44.960 --> 03:49:49.840]  doesn't stand up when you actually say well give me your password then show me your browsing history
[03:49:49.840 --> 03:49:55.200]  then people get concerned about it they're not concerned about a monolithic government having
[03:49:55.200 --> 03:50:01.680]  that power they are concerned about a random person on the street having that power which again is the
[03:50:01.680 --> 03:50:07.600]  complete millennial disconnect and this is why people really don't care about intrusions to their
[03:50:07.600 --> 03:50:13.040]  privacy because as long as it's you know a few steps away behind this monolithic government
[03:50:13.040 --> 03:50:16.560]  they're just not interested but if you ask them for their password
[03:50:16.560 --> 03:50:21.440]  then they start to get nervous let's hear a few more news stories here in the final few minutes
[03:50:21.440 --> 03:50:27.440]  Merkel served me for tea comedian says a german comedian who could be prosecuted for mocking
[03:50:27.440 --> 03:50:33.360]  the turkish president has accused angel merkel of filleting him and serving him for tea so again
[03:50:33.360 --> 03:50:41.040]  this is jan bowerman who basically wrote a poem insulting the turkish president and merkel basically
[03:50:41.040 --> 03:50:46.560]  threw him to the dogs and said that this could should go to court because germany has this bizarre
[03:50:46.560 --> 03:50:52.240]  draconian law which says that if you insult a head of state then that's a crime absolutely
[03:50:52.240 --> 03:50:57.520]  tyrannical we'll get back into this and other news in the final segment of the alex jones show

[03:55:33.120 --> 03:55:38.800]  from students at the university of massachusetts where if a male student goes to a party and
[03:55:38.800 --> 03:55:45.360]  basically looks at a woman she files sexual assault charges well this is out of the college fix
[03:55:46.000 --> 03:55:52.720]  female student straddles guy without his consent he gets suspended for rape
[03:55:53.600 --> 03:55:58.720]  this is a quote out of the article she straddled him and started unbuttoning his shirt according
[03:55:58.720 --> 03:56:04.320]  to john doe's court filings later he alleged she fondled him which he took as a clear indication
[03:56:04.320 --> 03:56:10.240]  of her consent john asked her to go further but she declined the two part at about one thirty a.m
[03:56:10.800 --> 03:56:17.600]  yet two days later she accused him of failing to obtain her consent going to both hospital and
[03:56:17.600 --> 03:56:23.600]  police came claiming that john quote tried to force her to perform oral sex so again yet another
[03:56:23.600 --> 03:56:30.000]  case of one of these feminists being radicalized in the gender studies class being radicalized
[03:56:30.000 --> 03:56:37.200]  by the propaganda about a college rape campus myth which doesn't exist and then treating
[03:56:37.200 --> 03:56:44.240]  any sexual contact even though she initiated it as sexual assault on behalf of the man
[03:56:45.120 --> 03:56:50.320]  this is increasing inocurrence it's increasing in severity even though in every single case the
[03:56:50.320 --> 03:56:58.080]  uva rape hoax prime amongst them turns out to be a complete fraud mattress girl fraud
[03:56:58.080 --> 03:57:03.520]  fraud after fraud and yet this narrative you know one in five women are raped on college campuses
[03:57:03.520 --> 03:57:09.760]  continues to be proffered by not only mainstream media but also by people like obama himself
[03:57:10.560 --> 03:57:16.880]  again completely ludicrous over in germany the cultural enrichment of europe continues
[03:57:16.880 --> 03:57:23.520]  german cover-up scandal ministry urged erasing rape from monstrous cologne migrant attack report
[03:57:23.520 --> 03:57:27.440]  now we know that they covered up the fact that these attacks even happened for three days
[03:57:27.440 --> 03:57:32.560]  afterwards again committed by a large group of predominantly muslim migrants now it's
[03:57:32.560 --> 03:57:38.560]  emerged that one of the top police officers engaged in the investigation ordered the word
[03:57:38.560 --> 03:57:46.800]  rape to be removed entirely over in france we've got the minister for urban affairs patrick canna
[03:57:46.800 --> 03:57:52.240]  saying that there are a hundred neighborhoods in france that present potential similarities
[03:57:52.240 --> 03:57:57.680]  with what's happened in mollenbeek which of course was the wellspring of radicalization
[03:57:57.680 --> 03:58:05.280]  which produced the brussels bombers and several of the paris massacre plotters so the urban area
[03:58:05.280 --> 03:58:10.480]  minister over there in france is basically saying we have a hundred of these areas while the media
[03:58:10.480 --> 03:58:16.640]  still pretends that muslim no go geto zones don't exist danish exhibit portraying paris and
[03:58:16.640 --> 03:58:21.360]  brussels attackers as martyrs reported to police basically they had this leftist opus
[03:58:21.360 --> 03:58:28.400]  exhibition which said that the brussels and paris terrorists were heroes in their own way
[03:58:28.400 --> 03:58:33.600]  that's how the left treats terrorists that's going to wrap it up this edition of the alex jong
