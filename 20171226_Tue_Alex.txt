[00:00:06.845 --> 00:00:15.239]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:19.272 --> 00:00:34.544]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was just recently asked by some family if they thought it'd be a good idea to take the Amtrak train down from Washington, down Highway 1, one of the most scenic routes in the world, to San Francisco on a classic two-day trip.
[00:00:34.544 --> 00:00:40.268]  And I said, I wouldn't get on an Amtrak train if my life depended on it.
[00:00:40.268 --> 00:00:44.031]  And I sure wouldn't bring my children on one.
[00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:46.013]  Because they haven't updated the rail beds
[00:00:48.335 --> 00:00:52.018]  In 60 years, we have worse rail beds than Mexico.
[00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:58.722]  That's why trains can go 250 miles an hour in Japan or in Germany, but not in the U.S.
[00:00:58.722 --> 00:01:06.288]  My grandmother, when she was going to college, would shoot down from East Texas to get her master's in Houston on a train that went 135 miles an hour.
[00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:11.477]  Now they can't go 40 miles an hour on that same track.
[00:01:11.477 --> 00:01:12.017]  Here it is.
[00:01:12.017 --> 00:01:13.078]  Train wrecked Tacoma.
[00:01:13.078 --> 00:01:13.919]  Death toll unknown.
[00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:15.099]  80 mile an hour.
[00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:16.620]  Flew off the track.
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.922]  Looks like it obviously had a bunch of passengers on board.
[00:01:18.922 --> 00:01:20.123]  Pray for those folks.
[00:01:20.123 --> 00:01:21.163]  That's all coming up.
[00:01:21.163 --> 00:01:22.504]  So much more.
[00:01:22.504 --> 00:01:24.766]  Obama's been caught working with Hezbollah to deal drugs.
[00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.367]  That's mainstream news.
[00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:27.468]  You cannot make this up.
[00:01:27.468 --> 00:01:30.029]  But first, powerful report by John Bowne.
[00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:35.193]  Mueller ignores the Fourth Amendment to foment a coup.
[00:01:35.193 --> 00:01:36.654]  It's not looking good.
[00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:42.714]  Quite sad to see that, so my people were very upset about it.
[00:01:42.714 --> 00:01:47.599]  I can't imagine there's anything on them, frankly, because as we said, there's no collusion.
[00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:54.046]  There's no collusion whatsoever, but a lot of lawyers thought that was pretty sad.
[00:01:54.767 --> 00:02:01.914]  What does the Fourth Amendment mean to special counsel Robert Mueller's bogus deep state investigation of the commander-in-chief?
[00:02:01.914 --> 00:02:04.296]  Well, as you would expect, nothing.
[00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:13.245]  In a letter obtained by Fox News and sent to House and Senate committees on Saturday, the transition team's attorney alleges unlawful conduct.
[00:02:13.365 --> 00:02:21.492]  by the career staff at the General Services Administration and handing over transition documents to the special counsel's office.
[00:02:21.492 --> 00:02:37.286]  Corey Langhofer, the counsel to Trump for America, argues the GSA did not own or control the records in question and the release of documents could be a violation of the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.
[00:02:37.486 --> 00:02:46.539]  The emails are said to be of a sensitive nature regarding Trump's interior conversations about nominees, not to mention executive policy.
[00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:54.710]  However, once it was added to the spin cycle of the mainstream media, special counsel Mueller came out smelling as fresh as a daisy.
[00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:05.876]  But this has been a months-long, orchestrated, frankly, pathetic and also dangerous attack by Fox News, by many in the conservative right, to try to discredit Mueller.
[00:03:05.876 --> 00:03:11.259]  What they're doing is they're setting up the ground game to fire Mueller.
[00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:14.762]  And let me tell you, the majority of American people will not allow this.
[00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:25.012]  MoveOn has had more than 80,000 people sign up for protests if in case Mueller is indeed fired.
[00:03:25.012 --> 00:03:27.975]  Over 500 events across the country.
[00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:29.877]  People are not going to take this.
[00:03:30.037 --> 00:03:37.325]  Except a Harvard-Harris poll released recently said 54% of Americans of all parties see the investigators as biased against Trump.
[00:03:37.325 --> 00:03:40.169]  So you may see it on your end, but polling shows different.
[00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:40.649]  That's one poll.
[00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:41.891]  There are many polls out there.
[00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:42.892]  This is a total distraction.
[00:03:42.892 --> 00:03:44.534]  Let me just say, this whole discussion...
[00:03:45.114 --> 00:03:52.282]  It's so interesting to me because it's all part of the Trump legal team assault on the integrity of law enforcement in this country.
[00:03:52.282 --> 00:04:02.292]  Intended to distract people from the investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and its officials.
[00:04:02.712 --> 00:04:04.033]  And Russian interference.
[00:04:04.033 --> 00:04:07.556]  And this is all a set-up, potentially, to fire Bob Mueller.
[00:04:07.556 --> 00:04:25.571]  When Trump's lawyers come out and use the press to say Mueller's acting unlawfully, that creates a narrative for right-wing media to put on the bottom of the screen, to put in banner headlines on the website, to add more fodder to this narrative that the Mueller probe is illegitimate and needs to be shut down.
[00:04:26.031 --> 00:04:29.554]  I believe that the President wants all of this shut down.
[00:04:29.554 --> 00:04:36.060]  He wants to shut down these investigations and he wants to fire Special Counsel Mueller.
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:49.133]  The rumor on the Hill when I left yesterday was that the President was going to make a significant speech at the end of next week and on December 22nd when we are out of D.C.
[00:04:49.133 --> 00:04:50.053]  he was going to fire
[00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:52.481]  Robert Mueller.
[00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:59.604]  Oddly enough, as the world turns, regardless of the beating of the dead horse of Russia's collusion with the White House... We'll be back.
[00:04:59.604 --> 00:05:00.144]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.144 --> 00:05:01.025]  Mike in Arizona.
[00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:02.065]  You're on the air worldwide.
[00:05:02.065 --> 00:05:03.305]  Go ahead.
[00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:05.226]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:05:05.226 --> 00:05:15.730]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.091]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[00:05:19.571 --> 00:05:19.871]  Absolutely.
[00:05:42.324 --> 00:05:55.240]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:04.000]  We've got it.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.805]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:06:09.805 --> 00:06:14.189]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:20.494]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:06:20.494 --> 00:06:25.518]  It was Lieutenant Colonel Matt Schmithmeck
[00:06:31.753 --> 00:06:42.679]  That joined us a year and a half ago on the broadcast.
[00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:54.686]  And he laid out how a shipment was going from a specific Arizona base of hundreds of millions of dollars of weapons, some of them high impact.
[00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:59.821]  That's grenade launchers, anti-tank weapons, you name it.
[00:06:59.821 --> 00:07:07.446]  To the Mexican cartels and then to Hezbollah, but also to ISIS, to fund both sides.
[00:07:07.446 --> 00:07:07.966]  Breaking!
[00:07:07.966 --> 00:07:14.429]  Fast and Furious was secret program to ship arms to Middle East terrorists.
[00:07:14.429 --> 00:07:17.451]  Haddan Salazar, March 30th, 2016.
[00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:23.955]  Now, he got physically attacked for coming on the broadcast.
[00:07:25.791 --> 00:07:30.213]  And death-threatened his family, you name it.
[00:07:30.213 --> 00:07:32.373]  So again, three people attacked him from behind.
[00:07:32.373 --> 00:07:38.355]  And of course, Tosh Plumlee is a very famous CIA whistleblower.
[00:07:38.355 --> 00:07:40.456]  He recommended Mr. Smith-Mack.
[00:07:40.456 --> 00:07:45.518]  Tosh Plumlee is basically in hiding right now in South America.
[00:07:45.518 --> 00:07:48.459]  So that's what you have to go through to come on this show and do this stuff.
[00:07:48.459 --> 00:07:51.800]  These are very honorable men.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.941]  And because of them, we now have this information.
[00:07:55.503 --> 00:07:56.103]  It's Politico!
[00:07:56.103 --> 00:08:00.624]  They're not going to give us credit.
[00:08:00.624 --> 00:08:02.465]  It's all right here.
[00:08:02.465 --> 00:08:04.085]  And we'll give you the rest of the story.
[00:08:04.085 --> 00:08:20.009]  Obama letting Hezbollah deal cocaine all over Europe and all over the United States and work with Mexican drug cartels to ship drugs into this country.
[00:08:20.009 --> 00:08:24.850]  And the big story was, Obama wasn't just letting them do it, he was shipping them
[00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:29.437]  Anti-tank weapons, you name it.
[00:08:29.437 --> 00:08:32.898]  You go, why would they fund ISIS and Hezbollah?
[00:08:32.898 --> 00:08:37.640]  Because they want a crisis and a pretext to then move the U.S.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.361]  military into the area.
[00:08:39.361 --> 00:08:43.662]  Trump is reportedly not being cynical and trying to clean it all up and then hopefully leave.
[00:08:43.662 --> 00:08:46.683]  The problem is McMaster is ignoring that, keeping U.S.
[00:08:46.683 --> 00:08:51.845]  bases in Syria, and now it's come out from our sources and mainstream news, our
[00:08:53.243 --> 00:09:01.307]  Refueling, re-preparing, re-branding ISIS right now in counter-valence of the President.
[00:09:01.307 --> 00:09:05.569]  You are getting absolute, total exclusive here.
[00:09:05.569 --> 00:09:08.410]  Do you realize how dangerous this is?
[00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.551]  And I'm saying, this is not pearls before swine, is it?
[00:09:10.551 --> 00:09:15.813]  We're gonna get some clips because this all just came together this morning.
[00:09:15.813 --> 00:09:17.254]  And right before I went live, I went,
[00:09:18.186 --> 00:09:20.807]  Lieutenant Colonel Matt Smith-Mack.
[00:09:20.807 --> 00:09:24.610]  Because the name is, you know, is rare.
[00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:25.870]  And then I was saying, what was his name?
[00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:26.471]  What was his name?
[00:09:26.471 --> 00:09:27.031]  What was his name?
[00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:27.671]  What was his name?
[00:09:27.671 --> 00:09:29.592]  And the crew found it in literal minutes.
[00:09:29.592 --> 00:09:31.133]  And it all just clicked again.
[00:09:31.133 --> 00:09:32.454]  He laid it all out.
[00:09:32.454 --> 00:09:40.899]  Now it's classified, so he couldn't give the specific weapons or any of it, but... That's an active duty guy!
[00:09:41.992 --> 00:09:48.739]  Coming out and saying, Obama has us ordered to ship these weapons in three weeks.
[00:09:48.739 --> 00:09:50.942]  Can you believe how much courage it took for him to do that?
[00:09:50.942 --> 00:09:53.364]  People keep saying, when are we going to see the courage?
[00:09:53.364 --> 00:09:54.746]  When are we going to see people stop this?
[00:09:54.746 --> 00:09:55.667]  Well, you just saw it.
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.241]  Should have stayed in contact with Matt.
[00:09:58.241 --> 00:10:02.304]  We just have so many powerful whistleblowers and patriots on that I don't take them for granted.
[00:10:02.304 --> 00:10:09.709]  We're just in such a war, politically, in the information war, in a pile of brass around us, that we just, it's the fog of war here.
[00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:11.330]  But this is incredible.
[00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:19.976]  Out of all the huge news we've got, everyone's focused on the tragic 80 mile an hour Amtrak flying off the rails, passenger train.
[00:10:19.976 --> 00:10:21.597]  Looks bad.
[00:10:21.597 --> 00:10:22.597]  No death toll yet.
[00:10:22.597 --> 00:10:24.318]  Drugsreport.com, Infowars.com.
[00:10:25.953 --> 00:10:38.359]  We have the latest, but you add this to Obama working with Iran in one-sided deals, and Obama doing side deals, and Obama working with the Arab Spring as well.
[00:10:38.359 --> 00:10:52.126]  The secret backstory of how Obama let Hezbollah off the hook, that's the whitewash from Politico because they know that Trump and his people are now on this, and that Obama is in deep trouble.
[00:10:53.499 --> 00:10:58.501]  And they can get in a lot of trouble for what they've done if we focus on it and talk about it.
[00:10:58.501 --> 00:11:09.664]  And you've now got Congressman Bud Cummins, Congressman Jim Jordan, Congressman Trey Gowdy, all saying the FBI committed crimes.
[00:11:09.664 --> 00:11:15.146]  It was a group of organized stay-behind network engaged in organized crime fraud.
[00:11:17.367 --> 00:11:35.457]  Against Trump and the American people, we have them with their organized conspiracy, the entire operation, a very tight-knit group, Comey, Strzok, the Justice Department official, his wife heading up Fusion GPS, hired to create the fake dossier.
[00:11:35.457 --> 00:11:38.578]  I mean, it is a tight-knit group.
[00:11:38.578 --> 00:11:39.939]  It isn't the general FBI.
[00:11:39.939 --> 00:11:45.522]  And it's because of good people in the FBI and in the military and in the ATF, quite frankly,
[00:11:46.715 --> 00:11:51.418]  I'm not defending that bad agency, but there's some good people, that we know all this, so it's all coming together.
[00:11:51.418 --> 00:11:57.302]  And I want to put the clips together today, I've got the crew on it, with all the different statements.
[00:11:57.302 --> 00:12:06.628]  Because now you've got the former Deputy Director of the FBI, we played that yesterday, coming out and saying, these people belong in Leavenworth.
[00:12:06.628 --> 00:12:08.889]  We'll play that clip, by the way, when we come back from break.
[00:12:08.889 --> 00:12:12.772]  They belong in Leavenworth!
[00:12:12.772 --> 00:12:15.834]  And Adan Salazar deserves a Pulitzer Prize.
[00:12:16.988 --> 00:12:19.410]  For working weeks on this story.
[00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:26.195]  And the Lieutenant Colonel deserves to really be defended.
[00:12:26.195 --> 00:12:29.238]  But instead, he got cracked down on.
[00:12:29.238 --> 00:12:31.580]  He got threatened.
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.501]  He got physically attacked.
[00:12:33.501 --> 00:12:36.323]  And we gave him our number and our info.
[00:12:36.323 --> 00:12:37.564]  We never heard from him again.
[00:12:37.564 --> 00:12:41.408]  God, who knows if he's even among us anymore?
[00:12:41.408 --> 00:12:43.429]  Plumlee's in South America.
[00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:44.050]  We know where.
[00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:45.291]  He doesn't want us to tell anybody.
[00:12:46.067 --> 00:12:50.310]  That's right, Tosh Plumlee has gone to South America over this.
[00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.492]  He's had to leave the United States.
[00:12:52.492 --> 00:13:06.123]  Very famous CIA contractor, Newfield Castro, knows all the big cartels, ran whole CIA operations, has left the building over this because there is a war going on behind the scenes.
[00:13:06.123 --> 00:13:09.406]  And they told Plumlee, off air he told me this, on air he said he was getting threatened.
[00:13:09.406 --> 00:13:13.890]  They said, listen old man, we're gonna come to your house and cut your GD head off.
[00:13:15.185 --> 00:13:19.488]  He said, fine, I'm dumping everything on you, and then he left the country.
[00:13:19.488 --> 00:13:35.459]  This is a guy until he retired three years ago that would be on the show with a line of C-130s lined up, loaded with heavy weapons, to be delivered to ISIS, calling in, saying, I got sources in NATO and the Pentagon and everywhere else that they're delivering high-powered weapons.
[00:13:35.459 --> 00:13:35.860]  Hold on.
[00:13:36.872 --> 00:13:37.673]  Hold on.
[00:13:37.673 --> 00:13:39.074]  We got to wait for all these aircraft.
[00:13:39.074 --> 00:13:40.375]  You're supposed to call in 15 minutes ago.
[00:13:40.375 --> 00:13:42.017]  And I talked to people that were with him.
[00:13:42.017 --> 00:13:45.040]  There's like a line of 10 aircraft about to deliver all the weapons.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:51.546]  He's going, I've got sources that are delivering these weapons.
[00:13:51.546 --> 00:13:56.030]  So you think about all that, ladies and gentlemen, that's what's going on here.
[00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:57.951]  That's what we're doing.
[00:13:57.951 --> 00:13:59.253]  Trump's not doing stuff like that.
[00:14:00.572 --> 00:14:05.475]  But McMaster, who remember said, we are going to invade Syria, we are going to take Assad out, remember six months ago?
[00:14:05.475 --> 00:14:07.136]  And Trump comes out and goes, no you're not!
[00:14:07.136 --> 00:14:09.258]  That's not true, stop it!
[00:14:09.258 --> 00:14:14.662]  But they built up these big forces right over the Iraqi border and they are reconstituting the groups to go in.
[00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:17.277]  And try to topple Assad again.
[00:14:17.277 --> 00:14:29.726]  That's why the Russians just pulled their troops out to take the high road to say, just pull your troops out, follow the agreement, don't overthrow this country that allows secular people and minority Christians and others to live there.
[00:14:29.726 --> 00:14:30.847]  Stop.
[00:14:30.847 --> 00:14:31.827]  Stop.
[00:14:31.827 --> 00:14:37.451]  But Trump, as you've seen, has his agenda frustrated at every single level.
[00:14:37.451 --> 00:14:38.792]  People say, oh, he's playing a double game.
[00:14:38.792 --> 00:14:39.653]  No, he's not.
[00:14:39.653 --> 00:14:40.974]  I know people that talk to the president.
[00:14:42.321 --> 00:14:46.208]  Days after McMaster said that they were going to go in, he said, no we're not.
[00:14:46.208 --> 00:14:47.089]  No boots on the ground.
[00:14:49.602 --> 00:14:50.643]  I'm going to make a statement on it.
[00:14:50.643 --> 00:14:52.465]  And then he made a statement on it.
[00:14:52.465 --> 00:14:54.246]  And that's why they were flipping out.
[00:14:54.246 --> 00:14:59.491]  Because Trump was able to talk to people then that would bring this stuff up and say, Mr. President, this is your promise.
[00:14:59.491 --> 00:15:00.112]  You said that.
[00:15:00.112 --> 00:15:01.353]  You know it's a quagmire.
[00:15:01.353 --> 00:15:04.536]  You know we need to stabilize the region, not be in there trying to stir things up.
[00:15:04.536 --> 00:15:05.737]  That's the old globalist agenda.
[00:15:05.737 --> 00:15:07.518]  Don't have to tell me that.
[00:15:07.518 --> 00:15:08.399]  Absolutely.
[00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:08.599]  What?
[00:15:08.599 --> 00:15:11.682]  Your Sam McMaster is on television saying that.
[00:15:11.682 --> 00:15:12.043]  Yes, sir.
[00:15:12.043 --> 00:15:13.284]  He said it on CNN yesterday.
[00:15:16.147 --> 00:15:28.108]  So they sneak around like bad children seeing what they can get away with and they become outraged when people get a hold of them and tell them what's going on.
[00:15:28.108 --> 00:15:29.470]  That's why it's important for people.
[00:15:30.778 --> 00:15:41.265]  Talk to the president when he goes out to speak or his security detail or anybody to tell him about stuff because they're trying to keep him totally isolated But again the secret back story of how Obama let Hezbollah off the hook.
[00:15:41.265 --> 00:15:43.587]  He didn't let him off the hook He let him deal drugs.
[00:15:43.587 --> 00:15:59.657]  He gave him weapons and it continued in front of everybody, but now it's coming out Stay with us more on the tragic derailment in Washington State more on the economy more on the FBI's Democrat operation coming unraveled the attempt to frame the president
[00:16:01.358 --> 00:16:02.839]  Hello, Mr. Anderson.

[00:18:09.233 --> 00:18:17.636]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.

[00:20:41.497 --> 00:21:05.651]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live, and by the way, we're in the middle of the kickoff of the 34-hour transmission to celebrate our free open society, the return of the Republic, the global awakening, and to say the words that the globalists hate so much, Merry Christmas, in their lust to dominate and control and dumb down civilization.
[00:21:05.651 --> 00:21:05.851]  Now,
[00:21:08.655 --> 00:21:13.218]  There is so much to go over, obviously, here today.
[00:21:13.218 --> 00:21:16.281]  And so many big developments happening.
[00:21:16.281 --> 00:21:22.325]  But I was reading leftist and globalist publications this weekend, and they're panicking.
[00:21:22.325 --> 00:21:24.247]  They're saying Mueller needs our help.
[00:21:24.247 --> 00:21:26.228]  He needs demonstrations.
[00:21:26.228 --> 00:21:29.350]  Mueller needs people in the streets.
[00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.313]  Mueller needs a congressional investigation to intensify.
[00:21:32.313 --> 00:21:36.596]  Mueller needs us because he's not going to be able to get Trump impeached.
[00:21:36.596 --> 00:21:37.837]  It's falling apart!
[00:21:39.278 --> 00:21:41.601]  Congressman Jim Jordan's being mean!
[00:21:41.601 --> 00:21:44.764]  Trey Gowdy's being mean!
[00:21:44.764 --> 00:21:49.389]  Former FBI Deputy Director James Kallstrom's being mean!
[00:21:49.389 --> 00:21:51.672]  Congressman Bud Cummings is being mean!
[00:21:51.672 --> 00:21:55.696]  Now there it is.
[00:21:55.696 --> 00:21:57.979]  There's Brian Stelter saying,
[00:21:59.284 --> 00:22:00.785]  Mueller is under attack!
[00:22:00.785 --> 00:22:02.265]  He's under attack!
[00:22:02.265 --> 00:22:11.349]  He's running around bullying people, getting stuff without warrants, spying on folks, manufacturing evidence up to his eyeballs with the Russians, but he's under attack.
[00:22:11.349 --> 00:22:14.610]  That means Trump's fighting back.
[00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:19.032]  That means that they've then got to whine and complain.
[00:22:19.032 --> 00:22:21.233]  They can dish it out, but they can't take it.
[00:22:22.827 --> 00:22:34.592]  Because they know, ladies and gentlemen, that they've been caught committing massive, massive crimes and massive fraud against our electoral process, against our president.
[00:22:34.592 --> 00:22:40.155]  Now Scarborough slams Fox News for fomenting a constitutional crisis could lead to violence.
[00:22:40.155 --> 00:22:41.796]  Oh!
[00:22:41.796 --> 00:22:43.916]  They're the ones fomenting violence with Antifa.
[00:22:43.916 --> 00:22:46.718]  They're the ones calling for a constitutional crisis going back a year ago.
[00:22:47.709 --> 00:22:58.074]  When Trump was president-elect, they're the ones that I've been warning you, we're building towards this, and then when they finally trigger it, they're going to turn around and say, we did it.
[00:22:58.074 --> 00:23:01.435]  No, Hillary stole the election from Bernie Sanders.
[00:23:01.435 --> 00:23:02.616]  The nomination.
[00:23:02.616 --> 00:23:05.217]  Hillary tried to steal it from Trump.
[00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:08.458]  You're the guys that are in bed with the Russians and the Communist Chinese.
[00:23:08.458 --> 00:23:10.339]  You're the ones that sold out the country.
[00:23:10.339 --> 00:23:12.480]  You're the ones that manufactured the dossier.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.881]  You're the ones that have been caught.
[00:23:15.993 --> 00:23:20.841]  And now you're getting more shrill, you're getting more panicked, you're getting more crazy.
[00:23:20.841 --> 00:23:27.270]  And the weak-minded people that follow you and buy into all this, they're getting more violent.
[00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:28.552]  They're attacking more people.
[00:23:29.517 --> 00:23:31.298]  They're shooting more Republicans.
[00:23:31.298 --> 00:23:32.399]  Their neighbors are Republican.
[00:23:32.399 --> 00:23:32.999]  They shoot them.
[00:23:32.999 --> 00:23:34.740]  Their neighbors are Republican congressmen.
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:35.381]  They shoot them.
[00:23:35.381 --> 00:23:37.903]  Their neighbor is a Republican legislator.
[00:23:37.903 --> 00:23:38.443]  They shoot them.
[00:23:38.443 --> 00:23:39.324]  Or a mayor.
[00:23:39.324 --> 00:23:42.165]  This is the new, oh, you're a Republican on the city council.
[00:23:42.165 --> 00:23:43.787]  I'm going to shoot you.
[00:23:43.787 --> 00:23:45.348]  Because you're a Nazi.
[00:23:45.348 --> 00:23:47.489]  And I'm a soldier in D-Day fighting you.
[00:23:47.489 --> 00:23:50.031]  Because it's so horrible what Trump's done.
[00:23:50.031 --> 00:23:51.512]  Trying to restore that country.
[00:23:51.512 --> 00:23:53.073]  Trying to break the back of political correctness.
[00:23:53.073 --> 00:23:59.277]  It's so horrible that you live in this echo chamber that we've got to go attack our Republican neighbors like Rand Paul
[00:23:59.657 --> 00:24:02.680]  Right now!
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.342]  So that's where this is.
[00:24:05.342 --> 00:24:07.944]  And now Scarborough says the violence is coming.
[00:24:07.944 --> 00:24:12.407]  The violence is coming because they've been caught.
[00:24:12.407 --> 00:24:15.830]  Making up the assaults that Trump supposedly engaged in.
[00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.411]  Making up the Russiagate.
[00:24:17.411 --> 00:24:19.813]  Making up what he's done with the economy.
[00:24:19.813 --> 00:24:24.217]  But as the economy begins to come back, their panic only intensifies.
[00:24:25.489 --> 00:24:26.429]  And they've been caught.
[00:24:26.429 --> 00:24:36.433]  Their whole hope, the insurance policy, to bring down Trump, has now been blown into a trillion little pieces.
[00:24:36.433 --> 00:24:40.515]  And when is McCabe going to resign, the director of the FBI?
[00:24:40.515 --> 00:24:43.917]  When is Mueller going to get indicted?
[00:24:43.917 --> 00:24:48.518]  You see, that's why they're spinning it now, that Trump better not fire Mueller!
[00:24:48.518 --> 00:24:49.719]  Trump better not fire Mueller!
[00:24:49.719 --> 00:24:53.360]  That's the line of sand for nationwide riots.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.441]  That proves he's corrupt.
[00:24:55.469 --> 00:24:58.470]  Well, he should be fired for all the fraud he's involved in.
[00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.251]  But hey, leave it there.
[00:25:00.251 --> 00:25:02.973]  Go, oh no, Mueller's going to stay.
[00:25:02.973 --> 00:25:07.015]  And Trump comes out all weekend in statements and says, I'm not firing him.
[00:25:07.015 --> 00:25:08.215]  He's a disgrace.
[00:25:08.215 --> 00:25:09.256]  He's a joke.
[00:25:09.256 --> 00:25:10.176]  He's a fraud.
[00:25:10.176 --> 00:25:11.897]  They go, oh, don't attack him.
[00:25:11.897 --> 00:25:21.762]  Don't bring up that you got the emails and the text of how it's all an open and shut conspiracy by your operatives and the FBI to take out the duly elected president.
[00:25:24.042 --> 00:25:26.804]  So that's why Trump says, I'm not considering firing special counsel.
[00:25:26.804 --> 00:25:27.524]  But they don't stop.
[00:25:27.524 --> 00:25:28.145]  They don't stop.
[00:25:28.145 --> 00:25:28.825]  They don't stop.
[00:25:28.825 --> 00:25:29.646]  They don't stop.
[00:25:29.646 --> 00:25:32.487]  They come out day after day and say, yes you are.
[00:25:32.487 --> 00:25:33.948]  Absolutely red line.
[00:25:33.948 --> 00:25:34.629]  Eric Holder.
[00:25:35.891 --> 00:25:44.257]  Incredibly corrupt former head of the Justice Department that was involved in all these cover-ups and Uranium One and everything calls for protest if Trump fires Mueller.
[00:25:44.257 --> 00:25:54.345]  Remember what Antifa came out a few days ago and said we're gonna have nationwide basically rampages if he fires him and notice he then says exactly what they said because it's all a Soros playbook.
[00:25:55.506 --> 00:25:56.486]  And here's another one.
[00:25:56.486 --> 00:26:01.528]  Trump, my people are very upset about Mueller obtaining emails illegally, which show nothing.
[00:26:01.528 --> 00:26:03.528]  They claim that's being mean to Mueller.
[00:26:03.528 --> 00:26:05.569]  To point out, you violated my rights.
[00:26:05.569 --> 00:26:07.369]  You SWAT teamed raid all these people.
[00:26:07.369 --> 00:26:08.409]  You got caught lying.
[00:26:08.409 --> 00:26:11.790]  You lied to get a fake warrant.
[00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:14.191]  That's bullying to stand up for yourself.
[00:26:14.191 --> 00:26:16.552]  Mueller walks over and stabs Trump right in the chest.
[00:26:16.552 --> 00:26:18.432]  And Trump says, that's not very nice.
[00:26:18.432 --> 00:26:20.093]  And they go, how dare you?
[00:26:20.093 --> 00:26:21.133]  I just stabbed you.
[00:26:23.353 --> 00:26:27.854]  Trump's transition lawyer, Mueller, improperly obtained documents in Russia probe.
[00:26:27.854 --> 00:26:31.095]  Even CNN admits that he breaks the law.
[00:26:31.095 --> 00:26:35.237]  And the real problem is he trumped to unveil America's first national security strategy today.
[00:26:35.237 --> 00:26:37.497]  That's why they're so upset.
[00:26:37.497 --> 00:26:38.858]  So let's play a few clips.
[00:26:38.858 --> 00:26:47.761]  Here is James Kallstrom on Fox over the weekend, former deputy director of the FBI, saying these people belong in Leavenworth.
[00:26:47.761 --> 00:26:48.101]  Here it is.
[00:26:49.099 --> 00:27:00.029]  Well, I think he can do what this guy tried to do.
[00:27:00.029 --> 00:27:01.551]  He can fabricate things.
[00:27:01.551 --> 00:27:03.212]  He can make up stuff.
[00:27:03.212 --> 00:27:03.933]  He can lie.
[00:27:03.933 --> 00:27:05.935]  He can be a total moron.
[00:27:05.935 --> 00:27:06.816]  He can recruit others.
[00:27:07.606 --> 00:27:10.910]  You know, he belongs in Leavenworth, this guy, in my personal view.
[00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:15.876]  I don't have all the facts, but from what I know, he belongs behind bars, this guy.
[00:27:15.876 --> 00:27:19.520]  You know, these things cannot happen in a democracy.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.762]  Yep, total fraud.
[00:27:20.762 --> 00:27:21.282]  Let's go ahead.
[00:27:21.282 --> 00:27:22.123]  Here's Bud Cummings.
[00:27:22.123 --> 00:27:23.365]  Here's part of the clips.
[00:27:23.365 --> 00:27:27.650]  A congressman takes on the FBI plot and exposes the FBI plot against Trump.
[00:27:28.567 --> 00:27:30.328]  So let's go through some of these issues.
[00:27:30.328 --> 00:27:39.735]  I mean, the number three guy at the Department of Justice, the number three guy hires his wife, who works for Fusion GPS.
[00:27:39.735 --> 00:27:54.746]  She's hired to do research about Trump colluding with the Russians at the same time that we know that Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation took $140 million after allowing the sale of 20% of the U.S.'
[00:27:54.706 --> 00:27:56.467]  's stockpile of uranium.
[00:27:56.467 --> 00:27:57.928]  Some people call that treason.
[00:27:58.348 --> 00:28:03.716]  That happens, and yet Bruce Ohr's wife is hired who works for Fusion GPS.
[00:28:03.716 --> 00:28:12.307]  They come up with this dossier, which we know is a bunch of garbage, and that's actually the justification for wiretapping the Trump Organization?
[00:28:13.427 --> 00:28:29.350]  Yeah, I mean, we find ourselves here, it appears, on the basis of a fraud that was perpetuated on the FBI and the Department of Justice and the United States intelligence agencies to form a predicate based on this fake dossier.
[00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:36.576]  And there were people along the chain that knew, or should have known, where it came from, who paid for it, and how credible it was.
[00:28:36.576 --> 00:28:39.558]  But it was used for foreign surveillance.
[00:28:39.558 --> 00:28:43.001]  It was used to unmask United States citizens.
[00:28:43.001 --> 00:28:47.285]  And then it was formed as the predicate for a special counsel that we are dealing with today.
[00:28:47.285 --> 00:28:49.006]  We're going to go to break and come back with the rest.
[00:28:49.006 --> 00:28:52.509]  This is so critical what you're watching, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:57.834]  The whole thing is coming down a criminal conspiracy of Democrats inside to engage in fraud against everyone.
[00:28:59.184 --> 00:29:02.547]  Hey, Daniel Brinkman, why NuMana storable foods?

[00:32:00.874 --> 00:32:01.675]  I'm so excited.
[00:32:01.675 --> 00:32:04.456]  The new product at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:04.456 --> 00:32:10.240]  In a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.841]  The real red pill.
[00:32:11.841 --> 00:32:14.803]  This is a heart and brain pill.
[00:32:14.803 --> 00:32:17.345]  A nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:32:17.345 --> 00:32:19.066]  But boy, does it stimulate.
[00:32:19.066 --> 00:32:20.347]  Because it's beyond that.
[00:32:20.347 --> 00:32:26.651]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients.
[00:32:26.651 --> 00:32:28.152]  But it wasn't prescription.
[00:32:28.152 --> 00:32:29.133]  But they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:32:31.214 --> 00:32:50.811]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:32:50.811 --> 00:32:53.493]  It is amazing!
[00:32:53.493 --> 00:32:58.477]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[00:33:03.251 --> 00:33:14.877]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.877 --> 00:33:19.620]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:20.600]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:24.128 --> 00:33:27.951]  All right, we've reached an extremely dangerous juncture right now.
[00:33:27.951 --> 00:33:45.642]  The globalist program to block the American reboot and the attempt to simply get our sovereignty back into the United States and to get our own country under control of the people again, that has them pulling out all the stops.
[00:33:45.642 --> 00:33:48.164]  But every one of their operations is failing right now.
[00:33:49.537 --> 00:34:05.385]  So they are going to full weaponization, where every comedy show, every major TV show, every news show, every newspaper is basically saying, let's get violent, let's attack Trump supporters, let's attack Trump, let's have a civil war.
[00:34:05.385 --> 00:34:15.070]  And they just hope they can foam in enough violence, enough intimidation, and enough bullying to make the American people roll over to their demands.
[00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:17.511]  And it's very sad to see the very weak-minded people
[00:34:18.473 --> 00:34:29.779]  Even if the economy comes back and good things happen, they really believe that the American people and Trump are physically hurting them, so they're going out and physically attacking, they're bullying.
[00:34:29.779 --> 00:34:44.888]  Scarborough, again, the clip's coming up, has come out and said that Trump is so horrible that he's going to cause violence in America to erupt while the former Attorney General calls for people to hit the streets to remove Trump.
[00:34:46.192 --> 00:34:48.514]  And while they run full-page ads in the New York Times.
[00:34:48.514 --> 00:34:49.955]  And we say, hey, you're fomenting all this.
[00:34:49.955 --> 00:34:50.496]  They go, no, we're not.
[00:34:50.496 --> 00:34:51.396]  You're crazy.
[00:34:51.396 --> 00:35:07.129]  Scarborough slams Fox News for fomenting a constitutional crisis could lead to violence because Fox News is daring to have congressmen on with the emails and the text messages and the FBI files where they met with the deputy director.
[00:35:08.234 --> 00:35:15.816]  On how to keep Trump out of office, and how to create an insurance policy, a made-up dossier, to push the fake Russian narrative.
[00:35:15.816 --> 00:35:37.542]  We have caught them in a gigantic, arrogant, foaming at the mouth, arrogance-fueled, rabid dog, reckless, naked, bold, ridiculous fraud.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:45.522]  Run by, it looks like, maybe 15 people in the Justice Department and the FBI.
[00:35:45.522 --> 00:35:55.085]  And that really makes me feel good to know that for all the problems in our government, they tried to keep it down to like 15 people, knowing that it would leak and they'd get in trouble, which of course it did leak.
[00:35:56.485 --> 00:36:01.246]  And people are going to start covering their butts now because they don't all want to go to prison.
[00:36:01.246 --> 00:36:05.448]  And I don't know how the Clintons and their operatives and the FBI get away with this.
[00:36:05.448 --> 00:36:10.989]  I don't know how Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch or James Comey or Eric Holder.
[00:36:10.989 --> 00:36:13.410]  I don't see how Strzok gets away with this.
[00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:15.550]  And there's only a couple others.
[00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:18.811]  The Justice Department official, his wife at Fusion GPS.
[00:36:18.811 --> 00:36:21.732]  I don't see how they put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[00:36:21.732 --> 00:36:23.092]  And that's the issue.
[00:36:23.092 --> 00:36:24.793]  They're now at the full cornered
[00:36:26.107 --> 00:36:36.395]  Hyena point, and we're moving in for the political final blow, and they're going to hit us with whatever else they got.
[00:36:36.395 --> 00:36:38.537]  I think they're going to go ahead and make their move to kill the president.
[00:36:38.537 --> 00:36:43.580]  I think in the next 30 days, I think they're going to make an assassination attempt.
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:46.923]  I just, my gut, I see all of them together, they're that desperate.
[00:36:46.923 --> 00:36:51.727]  They're either going to give up or they're going to activate their cells, and a lot of my smart sources agree with that.
[00:36:52.805 --> 00:37:00.111]  And they've got a lot of mentally ill Democrats and people inside the Secret Service, inside other places in government.
[00:37:00.111 --> 00:37:12.422]  And, you know, whenever the Clintons and the Obamas would go into military areas, they'd have everybody take the clips, the magazines, the ammunition out of their firearms.
[00:37:12.422 --> 00:37:13.923]  Trump isn't doing that.
[00:37:13.923 --> 00:37:15.124]  They're not taking the ammunition out.
[00:37:16.412 --> 00:37:20.375]  I don't think they should.
[00:37:20.375 --> 00:37:22.857]  The President, if he's going to get killed, he's ready to get killed.
[00:37:22.857 --> 00:37:24.679]  That's just where this is going to go next.
[00:37:24.679 --> 00:37:26.260]  It's going to be like when they killed Julius Caesar.
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:27.240]  You know what happened to the plotters?
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.322]  I mean, they really brought down hell on them then.
[00:37:29.322 --> 00:37:38.009]  I mean, I don't want the President to be killed, but if they are dumb enough to actually do it, boy, they have sealed their warrant of death.
[00:37:38.009 --> 00:37:42.312]  I mean, they have guaranteed they are all going to probably never even see court.
[00:37:45.899 --> 00:37:49.402]  They're playing chicken with people that are ready to mash down the accelerator.
[00:37:49.402 --> 00:37:51.423]  Because I know I'm mashing it down.
[00:37:51.423 --> 00:37:53.525]  I'm pointing my car right at the nose of theirs.
[00:37:53.525 --> 00:37:54.165]  So is Trump.
[00:37:54.165 --> 00:37:56.167]  That's the spirit.
[00:37:56.167 --> 00:37:57.968]  You awaken the sleeping giant.
[00:37:57.968 --> 00:37:59.069]  Pedal to the metal.
[00:37:59.069 --> 00:38:02.172]  Only thing that feels good is to not turn.
[00:38:02.172 --> 00:38:03.553]  We're not going to turn.
[00:38:03.553 --> 00:38:04.874]  We're not going to back down.
[00:38:04.874 --> 00:38:05.754]  We're not going to give up.
[00:38:05.754 --> 00:38:07.196]  We're going to break your will.
[00:38:07.896 --> 00:38:14.659]  We are going to break your will, and if you want to press down the accelerator and want to go right into us, that means we guarantee your defeat.
[00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:16.459]  Because we're doing this for everybody else.
[00:38:16.459 --> 00:38:20.121]  We're not Satan worshippers like you, who only care about themselves.
[00:38:20.121 --> 00:38:21.761]  We're going to get you.
[00:38:21.761 --> 00:38:23.182]  We're going to come for you.
[00:38:23.182 --> 00:38:24.642]  We're never going to stop.
[00:38:24.642 --> 00:38:26.363]  You're going to be absolutely destroyed.
[00:38:27.389 --> 00:38:30.031]  So you want to fight?
[00:38:30.031 --> 00:38:31.371]  You better believe you got one.
[00:38:31.371 --> 00:38:33.212]  And listen, Trump's not perfect.
[00:38:33.212 --> 00:38:35.234]  His administration's full of globalists.
[00:38:35.234 --> 00:38:37.855]  That's where he's, I mean, you can only draw from the swamp at this point.
[00:38:37.855 --> 00:38:44.879]  He's gotten a lot done, but he's restoring the power to the Republic, to the Congress, to the presidency, to the states, to the people.
[00:38:44.879 --> 00:38:46.120]  That's happening.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:50.843]  The globalist takeover of America is almost, at its tentacles, completely cut off.
[00:38:51.852 --> 00:38:53.514]  That's why their money's drying up.
[00:38:53.514 --> 00:38:54.796]  It's why they're flipping out.
[00:38:54.796 --> 00:38:59.442]  It's why they got Phil Mudd on TV saying we're gonna kill the president, former deputy director of the CIA.
[00:38:59.442 --> 00:39:04.028]  It's a confidence game to act powerful to the entire world.
[00:39:04.028 --> 00:39:05.509]  And now everything I've told you...
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:15.443]  About the criminality, about the network, about the fake dossier, it's all former deputy directors telling you it's a fraud, Congress people, and we have the documents.
[00:39:15.443 --> 00:39:33.589]  We have the real smoking gun documents that they don't have on the other side, on Russia, on selling us out, on making up a fake dossier, on what they haven't said yet is they paid two million to Fusion GPS and she got the main contract, the wife of the guy that called for the funding.
[00:39:38.188 --> 00:39:39.570]  And of course the Washington Post gets it.
[00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:42.233]  Do the Trump cabinet picks want to run the government or dismantle it?
[00:39:42.233 --> 00:39:43.755]  No, you got it.
[00:39:43.755 --> 00:39:46.178]  We're dismantling it.
[00:39:46.178 --> 00:39:47.900]  We told you.
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:48.581]  It's too big.
[00:39:48.581 --> 00:39:49.743]  It's out of control.
[00:39:49.743 --> 00:39:51.585]  Get off our back.
[00:39:51.585 --> 00:39:55.010]  You put all this on us and bragged it was so we couldn't compete with anybody.
[00:39:55.956 --> 00:39:58.738]  It was a saboteur operation against the Republic.
[00:39:58.738 --> 00:40:07.743]  There are powerful elites that aren't devil worshippers, they're not perfect by the way, who don't have it out for America or Western civilization, and they want to build something good!
[00:40:07.743 --> 00:40:13.006]  Doesn't mean we won't slit your throat in a minute if you try to stop us.
[00:40:13.006 --> 00:40:16.047]  See, you scumbags take our kindness for weakness.
[00:40:17.287 --> 00:40:21.471]  You're going to find out that's not how the cow ate the cabbage.
[00:40:21.471 --> 00:40:22.873]  You want a fight?
[00:40:22.873 --> 00:40:24.735]  You have got one.
[00:40:24.735 --> 00:40:25.976]  You want a fight?
[00:40:25.976 --> 00:40:27.177]  You've got one.
[00:40:27.177 --> 00:40:27.938]  You want one?
[00:40:27.938 --> 00:40:28.639]  You got one.
[00:40:28.639 --> 00:40:29.300]  You want one?
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.522]  You got one.
[00:40:31.522 --> 00:40:33.864]  I love being alive.
[00:40:33.864 --> 00:40:37.508]  I don't like the persecution, the dirty tricks that they've done to my family, but you know what?
[00:40:37.508 --> 00:40:39.851]  My family doesn't have any future if we don't beat you.
[00:40:41.249 --> 00:40:42.109]  You understand that?
[00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:43.170]  So I'm all in.
[00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:49.752]  And once people are all in about this thing and don't care about how they get bullied online or what their neighbors say to them, stand up for what you believe in.
[00:40:49.752 --> 00:40:51.893]  Speak up, don't be bullied, and we're going to win.
[00:40:51.893 --> 00:40:54.854]  By the way, one big way to stand up is financial funding.
[00:40:54.854 --> 00:41:00.797]  Most people plug every segment during Christmas, because it's the main time, you know, that merchants and people fund themselves.
[00:41:00.797 --> 00:41:04.218]  And that's how we fund ourselves, is selling high quality products.
[00:41:04.218 --> 00:41:05.859]  The networking folks, mainly with advertising.

[00:41:55.558 --> 00:42:04.101]  And the two things everybody's decided to buy this Christmas is the fluoride-free toothpaste, Super Blue, with the colloidal silver and the iodine, fortifying it.
[00:42:04.101 --> 00:42:06.081]  Adults and childrens, that is about to sell out.

[00:42:19.173 --> 00:42:21.054]  Androgen, and so much more.
[00:42:21.054 --> 00:42:25.217]  It's got all the known healthy compounds, but it's great for women as well.
[00:42:25.217 --> 00:42:27.979]  That is over-the-top strong, so be careful with it.
[00:42:27.979 --> 00:42:29.120]  It's 50% off.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:35.224]  Leading competitors are like $100 for formulas that aren't even as strong, or have as much of the compounds that's in alpha power.
[00:42:35.224 --> 00:42:40.768]  So, InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.

[00:42:59.434 --> 00:43:00.855]  Why is the fungus?
[00:43:00.855 --> 00:43:01.936]  Why is the mold?
[00:43:01.936 --> 00:43:03.657]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:43:03.657 --> 00:43:04.637]  What is going on?
[00:43:04.637 --> 00:43:05.398]  What has changed?
[00:43:29.714 --> 00:43:31.134]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[00:43:31.134 --> 00:43:32.155]  I want to get your reviews.
[00:43:32.155 --> 00:43:33.115]  I want to hear what you have to say.

[00:43:41.798 --> 00:43:46.479]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:43:46.479 --> 00:43:49.820]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:52.140]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:53.561]  Look at the response we're getting.
[00:43:53.561 --> 00:43:55.481]  We're changing the world together.
[00:43:55.481 --> 00:43:56.502]  You are the Infowar.
[00:43:56.502 --> 00:43:57.242]  God bless you all.
[00:43:58.826 --> 00:44:01.810]  Top scientists and researchers agree.
[00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:10.940]  We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:12.302]  So what do we do about it?
[00:44:12.302 --> 00:44:15.466]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[00:44:15.646 --> 00:44:23.394]  Fight back with the all-new supercharged BrainForce Plus and feel the rush without the crash.

[00:45:34.237 --> 00:45:34.817]  I think so.
[00:45:59.446 --> 00:45:59.986]  Not a group.
[00:45:59.986 --> 00:46:01.407]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:46:01.407 --> 00:46:02.728]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:46:02.728 --> 00:46:03.948]  Why is this so good?
[00:46:03.948 --> 00:46:09.231]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:46:09.231 --> 00:46:22.777]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:46:22.777 --> 00:46:24.118]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:46:24.898 --> 00:46:26.560]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:29.122]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:46:29.122 --> 00:46:30.443]  These are all parasites.
[00:46:30.443 --> 00:46:31.544]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:46:31.544 --> 00:46:32.885]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:46:32.885 --> 00:46:34.146]  You have the neem in there.
[00:46:34.146 --> 00:46:37.369]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:46:37.369 --> 00:46:40.532]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:46:40.532 --> 00:46:43.735]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:46:43.735 --> 00:46:44.776]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:46:44.776 --> 00:46:46.697]  LivingDefenseInfoWorksLife.com.
[00:46:46.697 --> 00:46:47.738]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:46:47.738 --> 00:46:49.760]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:46:51.301 --> 00:46:52.342]  You support the broadcast.
[00:46:52.342 --> 00:46:53.683]  Infowarslive.com.
[00:46:53.683 --> 00:46:55.925]  Thank you Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:46:55.925 --> 00:47:03.251]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:47:03.251 --> 00:47:05.934]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:45.566]  So, if you are a regular listener, you know that I have exposed, from their own websites, their own plans, the stated, admitted goals of Soros, the Deep State, the Democrats, in their own publications, saying we're going to cause a constitutional crisis.
[00:47:45.566 --> 00:47:49.389]  We're going to bring all this Mueller stuff up and then claim that Trump's trying to block it.
[00:47:50.182 --> 00:47:51.764]  Then we're going to have riots.
[00:47:51.764 --> 00:47:53.425]  Then we're going to activate the Black Lives Matter.
[00:47:53.425 --> 00:47:58.570]  Then we're going to have Republicans start getting shot and killed at their homes, public places.
[00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:00.472]  I mean, you see it happening.
[00:48:00.472 --> 00:48:03.234]  Then we're going to kill the president.
[00:48:03.234 --> 00:48:08.239]  And they do that, they even have Phil Mudd go on air and say the government's going to kill Trump.
[00:48:08.239 --> 00:48:14.245]  To look powerful to their other criminal networks to say, hey, hold fast, we're strong, he's dead.
[00:48:15.384 --> 00:48:30.531]  What all those folks need to do that have been approached about the coup is to go to the patriot media, go to the president, do your own YouTubes, because then it'll get big and the people around Trump won't be able to block him from getting it.
[00:48:30.531 --> 00:48:32.632]  Here's an example in Bloomberg.
[00:48:32.632 --> 00:48:35.753]  Washington bureaucrats are quietly working to undermine Trump's agenda.
[00:48:35.753 --> 00:48:36.813]  That's called mutiny.
[00:48:36.813 --> 00:48:42.316]  Well, they said, Obama said earlier this year, he said, don't worry, we've been spying on Trump.
[00:48:43.271 --> 00:48:49.215]  And don't worry, we've put people into all the positions so they won't let him hire anybody under him.
[00:48:49.215 --> 00:48:50.957]  We'll just fire those people.
[00:48:50.957 --> 00:48:53.398]  And they'll lie right to the President's face.
[00:48:53.398 --> 00:48:58.682]  Just like McCabe said, Sir, I'm loyal, I'll follow the Constitution, I'm not a Clinton operative.
[00:48:58.682 --> 00:49:01.644]  Okay, McCabe, you're a nominee.
[00:49:01.644 --> 00:49:07.829]  And then McCabe is the ringleader in the emails and text messages creating the fraud of the Fusion GPS.
[00:49:10.046 --> 00:49:13.467]  Now you understand what the president is up against just like we are.
[00:49:13.467 --> 00:49:14.768]  He's just a beachhead.
[00:49:14.768 --> 00:49:25.171]  He gives the orders, and they've ignored 90% of them, but still the economy's coming back because we were so tied down by these Lilliputians.
[00:49:25.171 --> 00:49:28.292]  And again, they've said in Atlantic Monthly, in the
[00:49:29.730 --> 00:49:42.482]  New Yorker, in the Financial Times, in the last year, hundreds of times, how they want a civil emergency, how they're going to call it an emergency that's his fault, how they're then going to activate riots and say, oh, the economy plunged, it's his fault.
[00:49:42.482 --> 00:49:46.046]  They're ready to cause a depression!
[00:49:46.046 --> 00:49:46.907]  We're on the edge!
[00:49:49.707 --> 00:49:52.008]  That's why we've got to expose what they're doing.
[00:49:52.008 --> 00:49:53.948]  That's why we've got to expose their plan.
[00:49:53.948 --> 00:50:16.273]  And now, word for word, when I told you they were planning to do with this soft coup that's going hot, Scarborough comes out, who is the mouthpiece of these people, and says it all this morning, laced with baloney, when they're the ones causing the crisis, when they're the ones that stole the nomination from Sanders, when they're the ones that tried to block Trump being seated, when they're the ones that created the frauds.
[00:50:19.833 --> 00:50:33.279]  And now we learn, I already knew this, but that Trump had hired different private contractor groups that were known to be loyal to the country, who weren't globalist.
[00:50:33.279 --> 00:50:39.082]  Eric Prince and some other groups out of Florida.
[00:50:39.082 --> 00:50:40.083]  Private contractor groups.
[00:50:41.345 --> 00:51:02.494]  To protect him during the campaign, during the time that he was in transition, and they've tried to, the Secret Service tried to get rid of them, but some of those groups are still there, and they've told the President, it now came out in Politico and The Intercept, word for word what I said, there's a rogue group of CIA and FBI, they're planning your overthrow, we're trying to stop them, they've been counter-surveilling them.
[00:51:02.494 --> 00:51:06.676]  But only surveilling very legal surveillance on the President.
[00:51:06.676 --> 00:51:09.037]  Only doing it at point-blank range in the streets.
[00:51:10.934 --> 00:51:14.839]  Only with human intelligence on the ground watching what's going on.
[00:51:14.839 --> 00:51:19.045]  I mean, this is a civil war, folks.
[00:51:19.045 --> 00:51:20.426]  We're taking the country back.
[00:51:20.426 --> 00:51:23.410]  In fact, it's beyond a civil war because we're the Americans.
[00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:24.271]  Doesn't mean we're perfect.
[00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:32.394]  Private lives, intelligence agencies, citizens in government, corporate people, you name it, who aren't traitors, who just want the country back.
[00:51:32.394 --> 00:51:35.215]  That's all we want, is our country back, run by the people.
[00:51:35.215 --> 00:51:38.698]  And we want classic Americana prosperity, not globalism.
[00:51:38.698 --> 00:51:47.824]  And so, we're being demonized, we're under attack, and the bureaucrats are just, in a mutinous fashion, ignoring everything.
[00:51:47.824 --> 00:51:49.865]  But they can't hold on much longer, it's been a year.
[00:51:51.602 --> 00:51:54.164]  And they're getting scared and they've been caught in their early fraud.
[00:51:54.164 --> 00:51:54.944]  They were arrogant.
[00:51:54.944 --> 00:51:56.285]  They thought he'd never win.
[00:51:56.285 --> 00:51:59.768]  They set this fraud up thinking it was an insurance policy.
[00:51:59.768 --> 00:52:04.051]  Then the arrogance went to fear as they knew they were all going to go to prison.
[00:52:04.051 --> 00:52:06.672]  And Trump reached out early on and said, just stop it.
[00:52:06.672 --> 00:52:07.833]  Let's move forward with the country.
[00:52:07.833 --> 00:52:09.214]  I'll leave you alone.
[00:52:09.214 --> 00:52:11.996]  I told the president, I said, sir, that is a mistake.
[00:52:11.996 --> 00:52:14.197]  You must go after them now.
[00:52:14.197 --> 00:52:15.919]  They are going to do X, Y, Z.
[00:52:17.995 --> 00:52:20.896]  And the media goes, why does Trump keep listening to InfoWars?
[00:52:20.896 --> 00:52:22.697]  He says it and then Trump says it a week later.
[00:52:22.697 --> 00:52:23.838]  Because I'm right!
[00:52:23.838 --> 00:52:24.538]  I'm right!
[00:52:24.538 --> 00:52:25.778]  Over and over and over again!
[00:52:25.778 --> 00:52:27.059]  Because I live this!
[00:52:27.059 --> 00:52:29.980]  I'm not a lazy blob!
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:33.722]  Like Phil Mudd that goes on TV and goes, we'll just kill the president!
[00:52:33.722 --> 00:52:35.883]  And then that's all he's got is his bravada!
[00:52:38.493 --> 00:52:40.054]  We're watching you, scum!
[00:52:40.054 --> 00:52:41.795]  We know about your plan more than you do!
[00:52:41.795 --> 00:52:44.277]  You just keep rolling the dice, hoping you're gonna win!
[00:52:44.277 --> 00:52:46.519]  This has all been war-gamed throughout history.
[00:52:46.519 --> 00:52:48.720]  It's been war-gamed here.
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:51.182]  You'll never get away with killing the President!
[00:52:51.182 --> 00:52:53.364]  And if you did, you will be destroyed!
[00:52:53.364 --> 00:52:58.787]  I haven't gotten to the Scarborough, and Roger Stone is here.
[00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:00.891]  But big exclusive stuff.
[00:53:00.891 --> 00:53:02.632]  We're going to play the Scarborough when he's on with us.
[00:53:02.632 --> 00:53:04.553]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:53:04.553 --> 00:53:05.633]  But it's here.
[00:53:05.633 --> 00:53:12.577]  But notice I'd say they're planning to cause a civil emergency and they're planning to call for COG and they're going to call it a national emergency and a national crisis.
[00:53:12.577 --> 00:53:14.098]  That the President is the crisis.
[00:53:14.098 --> 00:53:15.419]  They're trying to declare the 25th Amendment.
[00:53:15.419 --> 00:53:17.280]  They're going to say he's mentally ill and brain damaged.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.180]  They're going to blah blah blah.
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:21.342]  Because we have moles!
[00:53:21.342 --> 00:53:22.763]  We have moles inside!
[00:53:24.633 --> 00:53:40.947]  Who aren't out to get the country, who act like they're liberals, and sit there at the New York Times and the Washington Post in these meetings, where they go, the public's not buying it, it's all fraud, and Hillary and Obama are totally in bed with the Chinese and the Russians and everybody else, and what are we gonna do if we get caught?
[00:53:40.947 --> 00:53:44.491]  They're like, don't worry, next we'll say he has Alzheimer's, or they're just gonna kill him.
[00:53:45.489 --> 00:53:46.149]  You're like, really?
[00:53:46.149 --> 00:53:47.229]  They're like, don't worry.
[00:53:47.229 --> 00:53:48.470]  I've talked to the former director.
[00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:49.910]  They've got the teams ready.
[00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:54.911]  You know, I mean, if they're on TV saying they're going to kill the president, they're in these meetings, man.
[00:53:54.911 --> 00:53:57.392]  Because they've got to hype their people up.
[00:53:57.392 --> 00:53:58.332]  They're like, we're scared.
[00:53:58.332 --> 00:53:59.212]  We don't want to do this.
[00:53:59.212 --> 00:54:00.433]  The economy's coming back.
[00:54:00.433 --> 00:54:02.033]  My 401k's up 40%.
[00:54:02.033 --> 00:54:03.773]  These conversations are happening.
[00:54:03.773 --> 00:54:05.174]  And they're going, you shut up.
[00:54:05.174 --> 00:54:06.834]  You're part of it now.
[00:54:06.834 --> 00:54:09.115]  We're going to kill that orange-headed piece of crap.
[00:54:09.115 --> 00:54:10.275]  Now sit down and shut up!
[00:54:14.482 --> 00:54:15.363]  And Phil Mudd's on TV.
[00:54:15.363 --> 00:54:17.704]  The government's going to kill him!
[00:54:17.704 --> 00:54:21.027]  You're just saying that because you're getting your ass kicked, you un-American piece of trash!
[00:54:21.027 --> 00:54:24.289]  You big, fat, parasite garbage!
[00:54:24.289 --> 00:54:26.351]  Again, scum, you want to fight?
[00:54:26.351 --> 00:54:29.073]  Just go ahead and try to kill the President!
[00:54:29.073 --> 00:54:29.433]  Go ahead!
[00:54:31.578 --> 00:54:32.158]  I mean, let's go!
[00:54:32.158 --> 00:54:33.359]  You wanna fight?
[00:54:33.359 --> 00:54:37.020]  You're gonna... None of you will ever get away with this, you idiots.
[00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:38.481]  It's not Scarbro.
[00:54:38.481 --> 00:54:40.281]  Oh, I know he's got away with other stuff.
[00:54:40.281 --> 00:54:43.742]  So, like any other piece of garbage, he thinks he'll get away with this.
[00:54:43.742 --> 00:54:45.623]  You're not getting away with nothing.
[00:54:45.623 --> 00:54:48.284]  And here's a little secret about me.
[00:54:48.284 --> 00:54:50.405]  I'm not trying to get out of this.
[00:54:52.304 --> 00:54:52.784]  Myself.
[00:54:52.784 --> 00:54:53.425]  You understand?
[00:54:53.425 --> 00:54:56.306]  I want to see you burn in hell.
[00:54:56.306 --> 00:54:57.846]  I understand that filth.
[00:54:57.846 --> 00:55:01.928]  I'm not a devil worshipper, narcissistic coward, scum like you.
[00:55:01.928 --> 00:55:03.869]  I want to see you defeated.
[00:55:03.869 --> 00:55:04.449]  You understand?
[00:55:04.449 --> 00:55:08.731]  All of us have to have that attitude where we're not scared of anything.
[00:55:08.731 --> 00:55:12.273]  And we are committed, and we are not stopping, and that's it!
[00:55:12.273 --> 00:55:13.994]  That's it!
[00:55:13.994 --> 00:55:14.614]  You understand?
[00:55:18.482 --> 00:55:24.227]  Now, they will strike back, but these sacks of crud are going down.
[00:55:24.227 --> 00:55:28.752]  We have them shipping the arms to Hezbollah, Obama.
[00:55:28.752 --> 00:55:35.018]  We have that Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel coming on that broke it all here in March of last year.
[00:55:35.018 --> 00:55:38.581]  The whitewash is in the Politico today.
[00:55:38.581 --> 00:55:42.465]  The secret backstory of how Obama let Hezbollah off the hook.
[00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:51.211]  Off the hook for drug dealing all over the world and in the U.S.
[00:55:51.211 --> 00:55:54.453]  to buy arms.
[00:55:54.453 --> 00:55:57.174]  And guess who they were buying the arms from?
[00:55:57.174 --> 00:56:02.296]  Fast and Furious wasn't just shipping guns down to cause a Mexican Civil War.
[00:56:02.296 --> 00:56:06.278]  They were shipping high-impact anti-tank weapons.
[00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:09.692]  You name it.
[00:56:09.692 --> 00:56:13.935]  Through Mexico, through those ports, to the Middle East.
[00:56:13.935 --> 00:56:17.278]  And now, oh, I guess you want that to come out, Obama?
[00:56:17.278 --> 00:56:17.958]  It is.
[00:56:17.958 --> 00:56:23.423]  And to have a controlled demolition, you guys are releasing it through Politico to make it a whitewash.
[00:56:23.423 --> 00:56:24.784]  Oh, he let him off the hook.
[00:56:24.784 --> 00:56:27.326]  He didn't let him off the hook!
[00:56:27.326 --> 00:56:31.430]  He was in triple-X sex with them.
[00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:32.871]  He was in Congress with them.
[00:56:32.871 --> 00:56:36.154]  He was in bed with Iran, in bed giving them the weapons.
[00:56:39.352 --> 00:56:42.733]  So, get ready for all of that to come out.
[00:56:42.733 --> 00:56:53.157]  The lieutenant colonel that first broke it all, breaking fast and furious, with secret program to ship arms to Middle East terrorists, March 30th, last year, Adan Salazar!
[00:56:53.157 --> 00:56:54.638]  And now it's all coming out.
[00:56:54.638 --> 00:56:58.999]  This is the specific operation.
[00:56:58.999 --> 00:57:01.340]  This has all been ordered.
[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:05.662]  The guns are shipped out.
[00:57:05.662 --> 00:57:06.802]  The drugs are shipped out.
[00:57:08.891 --> 00:57:13.632]  And then the Arab and Muslim networks sell the drugs and buy more guns.
[00:57:16.109 --> 00:57:17.490]  Don't forget, store-wide free shipping.
[00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:19.432]  We need your financial support now more than ever.
[00:57:19.432 --> 00:57:20.172]  We are committed.

[00:58:07.397 --> 00:58:13.718]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[00:58:59.367 --> 00:59:04.150]  In fact, my good friend Stefan Molyneux said it's gonna be like the Battle of the Gods, Ragnarok.
[00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:06.171]  So get ready, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:00:03.234 --> 01:00:09.482]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.448 --> 01:00:22.193]  Okay, my friends, we are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Monday, the 18th day of December 2017.
[01:00:22.193 --> 01:00:25.215]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:00:25.215 --> 01:00:26.717]  We've got an overload of people today.
[01:00:26.717 --> 01:00:27.497]  It's going to be amazing.
[01:00:27.497 --> 01:00:30.400]  Roger Stone with breaking news in studio next segment.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.621]  We then have the Lieutenant Colonel from the Marine Corps on.
[01:00:33.632 --> 01:00:39.214]  Who first broke that Fast and Furious was being directly run on a military basis, not just out of gun shops.
[01:00:39.214 --> 01:00:43.336]  That was the low-level cover that it was just a sting program gone bad.
[01:00:43.336 --> 01:00:44.016]  That was nothing.
[01:00:44.016 --> 01:00:47.278]  That was just retail, part of an operation to blame gun owners.
[01:00:47.278 --> 01:00:49.599]  So they wanted some retail arms shipped into Mexico.
[01:00:49.599 --> 01:00:50.719]  It was U.S.
[01:00:50.719 --> 01:00:51.359]  Army, U.S.
[01:00:51.359 --> 01:01:00.063]  Marine Corps, heavy weapons, anti-tank weapons, full-auto machine guns, light machine guns, heavy machine guns, battle rifles.
[01:01:01.454 --> 01:01:08.981]  And then drugs were also given to Hezbollah, it's also ISIS, to be brought back in and then to buy more guns.
[01:01:08.981 --> 01:01:09.902]  That was all Obama.
[01:01:09.902 --> 01:01:10.823]  It's in Politico today.
[01:01:10.823 --> 01:01:13.125]  We broke it over a year ago.
[01:01:13.125 --> 01:01:16.168]  So that is coming up as well.
[01:01:16.168 --> 01:01:17.709]  This is so bombshell.
[01:01:17.709 --> 01:01:22.033]  And the entire FBI Clinton operation is now coming down.
[01:01:22.033 --> 01:01:24.675]  So Scarborough and the Democrats are now going directly
[01:01:25.814 --> 01:01:30.657]  to their day of rage that the Antifa groups that we broke yesterday called for.
[01:01:30.657 --> 01:01:34.740]  We told you yesterday the mainstream media will now call for rage in the streets.
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.801]  Holder has called for people to hit the streets.
[01:01:36.801 --> 01:01:39.443]  So has Scarborough claiming that Trump's going to fire Mueller.
[01:01:39.443 --> 01:01:40.384]  Not even true.
[01:01:40.384 --> 01:01:48.809]  But again, we're going to let Mueller just fry out there in the wind as all of these emails come out about he and McCaid fixing the whole thing.
[01:01:48.809 --> 01:01:49.550]  So that's coming up.
[01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:54.673]  But first I want to play this special report here or at least part of it.
[01:01:54.673 --> 01:01:55.094]  This is
[01:01:56.374 --> 01:01:59.796]  MSM covers it up while InfoWars breaks it.
[01:01:59.796 --> 01:02:02.697]  So here's part of a report for John Bowne.
[01:02:02.697 --> 01:02:07.019]  We are able to force things out that the media is already sitting on.
[01:02:07.019 --> 01:02:19.265]  Remember Roger Stone and others broke here two and a half months ago that McMaster was at a particular restaurant, particular place, and who he was with
[01:02:21.178 --> 01:02:24.720]  And that he said, oh, I just got off the phone with that idiot moron.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.800]  All he can do is use Twitter.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:26.700]  He's so stupid.
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.641]  I'm afraid he's going to blow the planet up.
[01:02:28.641 --> 01:02:31.463]  And that McMaster was a slob and drunk.
[01:02:31.463 --> 01:02:33.203]  Now, we knew the New York Post sat on that.
[01:02:33.203 --> 01:02:34.584]  The New York Times sat on that.
[01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:36.885]  We were given it because they sat on it.
[01:02:36.885 --> 01:02:40.526]  And then two months later, two and a half months later, it broke, what, two weeks ago.
[01:02:40.526 --> 01:02:43.808]  Exactly as we said, at the very restaurant, all of it confirmed.
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:54.282]  McMaster went to dinner with a CEO executive from Oracle, Safra Katz.
[01:02:54.282 --> 01:03:05.665]  Katz is widely admired in the business community and was being recruited as the possible chairman for the president's intelligence review board.
[01:03:06.827 --> 01:03:21.715]  McMaster became exceedingly inebriated, according to the report I have received, and during the dinner, took a phone call from the President, at least having the good sense to step away from the table.
[01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:27.518]  But when he returned, he went into a diatribe about his boss.
[01:03:27.518 --> 01:03:29.999]  He described the President as a dope,
[01:03:30.703 --> 01:03:47.577]  He said that he couldn't think beyond 140 characters, that he couldn't understand any complex issues, and that the idea of Trump with his hands on the nuclear football was inappropriate or scary.
[01:03:47.577 --> 01:03:54.823]  He said it's just scary, and that his view is, his job was to save Trump from blowing up the world.
[01:03:55.467 --> 01:04:05.434]  McMaster, as I started out in April, he started purging anybody who was remotely America First to anybody who actually cared about America.
[01:04:05.434 --> 01:04:11.698]  He had said that we need to get rid of all of the Trump people and bring in Obama holdovers.
[01:04:11.698 --> 01:04:15.601]  And then he said you can't even call people Obama holdovers.
[01:04:15.601 --> 01:04:22.746]  So right now we are in a war for the future of our nation and McMaster is the greatest national security threat facing America.
[01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:28.910]  That's our job, is to not get the attention or even be praised for what we do.
[01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:30.711]  It's to force the media to cover it.
[01:04:30.711 --> 01:04:32.072]  That's our real power.
[01:04:32.072 --> 01:04:34.614]  Because before, they could cover stuff up like that forever.
[01:04:34.614 --> 01:04:38.797]  They could cover up a Monica Lewinsky or Chinese missile secrets, you name it.
[01:04:38.797 --> 01:04:42.660]  If whistleblowers went public because there wasn't a DrudgeReport.com to put it up.
[01:04:43.311 --> 01:04:45.152]  Like back with Monica Lewinsky.
[01:04:45.152 --> 01:04:46.912]  McMaster trashed Trump at private dinner.
[01:04:46.912 --> 01:04:47.813]  MSN breaks story.
[01:04:47.813 --> 01:04:48.853]  InfoWars broke months ago.
[01:04:48.853 --> 01:04:51.414]  There's Dan Lyman's article from November 21st.
[01:04:51.414 --> 01:04:54.836]  You can scroll down into the article and actually click the original.
[01:04:54.836 --> 01:04:56.456]  InfoWars broke the story.
[01:04:56.456 --> 01:04:58.437]  Report McMaster labeled Trump.
[01:04:58.437 --> 01:05:07.641]  Top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us
[01:05:07.881 --> 01:05:10.522]  Fat, sick, and stupid.
[01:05:10.522 --> 01:05:11.903]  So what do we do about it?
[01:05:11.903 --> 01:05:15.245]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:20.327]  Fight back with the all-new, supercharged BrainForce Plus.
[01:05:20.327 --> 01:05:22.988]  And feel the rush without the crash.
[01:05:22.988 --> 01:05:29.231]  BrainForce Plus is the next generation of advanced neural activation and nootropics.
[01:05:29.231 --> 01:05:37.155]  And now we've added a brand new ingredient called Black Pepper Fruit Extract that gives you an added kick.

[01:05:50.730 --> 01:05:52.032]  It's the real deal.
[01:05:52.032 --> 01:05:53.774]  Brain Force Plus.
[01:05:53.774 --> 01:05:57.117]  Secure your bottle right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:59.665 --> 01:06:05.229]  Some of my colleagues at Trump Tower just a few minutes ago, there's a little optimism here.
[01:06:05.229 --> 01:06:07.591]  No one thought it was going to be this close at this point.
[01:06:07.591 --> 01:06:08.592]  Trump can still win this thing.
[01:06:08.592 --> 01:06:09.753]  We have another state to project.
[01:06:09.753 --> 01:06:10.954]  It is the state of North Carolina.
[01:06:10.954 --> 01:06:12.195]  Big battleground state.
[01:06:12.195 --> 01:06:13.036]  It's going to Donald Trump.
[01:06:13.036 --> 01:06:14.497]  I was actually ready to go to bed.
[01:06:16.659 --> 01:06:22.787]  This is going to be a very close election.
[01:06:22.787 --> 01:06:25.291]  I'm seeing these late-breaking trends.
[01:06:25.291 --> 01:06:27.534]  This could hand-trump the presidency, folks.
[01:06:27.534 --> 01:06:29.837]  This is not by any means over.
[01:06:30.097 --> 01:06:34.198]  I think there's some real jitter setting in Clinton headquarters right now.
[01:06:34.198 --> 01:06:40.901]  Wolf, the scene here is so different than it was a few hours ago when people were happy and relaxed.
[01:06:40.901 --> 01:06:43.022]  This is most unexpected.
[01:06:43.022 --> 01:06:47.103]  Certainly is a huge, huge surprise to so many people out there.
[01:06:47.103 --> 01:06:52.405]  I think we all thought it couldn't happen, that he couldn't do what he did, and guess what?
[01:06:52.905 --> 01:06:54.766]  He may just do it.
[01:06:54.766 --> 01:06:56.807]  Donald Trump has taken the lead.
[01:06:56.807 --> 01:06:59.049]  He has 216 electoral votes.
[01:06:59.049 --> 01:07:00.970]  This is truly the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:02.571]  He is pulling ahead of Hillary Clinton.
[01:07:02.571 --> 01:07:04.012]  You see it right there.
[01:07:04.012 --> 01:07:07.794]  The number of groups who are likely feeling real fear right now.
[01:07:08.174 --> 01:07:12.079]  You've got women, immigrants, who have been threatened by Donald Trump with deportation.
[01:07:12.079 --> 01:07:14.382]  How do I explain this to my children?
[01:07:14.382 --> 01:07:19.588]  I have Muslim friends who are texting me tonight saying, should I leave the country?
[01:07:19.588 --> 01:07:21.451]  America is crying tonight.
[01:07:21.451 --> 01:07:25.255]  I'm not sure how much of America, but a very, very significant portion.
[01:07:25.255 --> 01:07:27.278]  And I mean literally crying.
[01:07:30.609 --> 01:07:33.831]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:07:33.831 --> 01:07:37.913]  I'm your host Alex Jones, and you're tuned in to InfoWars Live.
[01:07:37.913 --> 01:07:53.121]  Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign, is here with us to cover so many big breaking stories, but obviously most of people's attention is turned towards the 76 people that have been transported to the hospital.
[01:07:53.121 --> 01:07:54.882]  No numbers yet on any dead, we hope.
[01:07:55.242 --> 01:08:01.787]  Well, they're saying three dead after Amtrak train derails from bridge onto Interstate 5 near Olympia.
[01:08:01.787 --> 01:08:05.609]  Seventy-plus transported, people still hanging from the rail cars.
[01:08:05.609 --> 01:08:15.396]  It crashed over a broken part of the bridge and went down into the interstate highway, crushing vehicles under it.
[01:08:15.396 --> 01:08:23.581]  And as I've said thousands of times, I've had family members that have asked me to go on these trains, these scenic trains, and I said, not on U.S.
[01:08:23.581 --> 01:08:24.022]  rail beds.
[01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:25.280]  Never.
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:27.962]  They are amongst the worst in the world.
[01:08:27.962 --> 01:08:33.546]  Our infrastructure has been purposely, for 50 years, absolutely shut down.
[01:08:33.546 --> 01:08:38.450]  And this is just incredible to see this unfolding.
[01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:46.235]  Multiple fatalities, scores injured after Amtrak train plunges off the bridge onto I-5.
[01:08:46.235 --> 01:08:47.836]  So that is happening, obviously.
[01:08:49.841 --> 01:09:12.124]  We're about to have something really plunge off a bridge, and that is the Democrats want to get days of rage, protest against Trump, claiming that he scuttled the Russia investigation, and is about to fire Mueller, and that he's simply exposing that it's a fraud, and having the emails that it was a Democrat operation, and based on a fraudulent dossier that the wife of the head of the Justice Department got paid to create, and all this collusion
[01:09:13.154 --> 01:09:20.562]  They are saying that they want days of rage, that they want people in the streets, that they want all of this happening.
[01:09:20.562 --> 01:09:26.048]  Scarborough slams Fox News for fomenting a constitutional crisis could lead to violence.
[01:09:26.048 --> 01:09:31.174]  Meanwhile, Trump says he's not firing Mueller, but they just keep coming back over and over and over again saying, yes, you are, yes, you are.
[01:09:31.174 --> 01:09:32.315]  Now, Roger, early on, had said,
[01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:33.976]  It's a fraudulent investigation.
[01:09:33.976 --> 01:09:34.997]  Presidents can do this.
[01:09:34.997 --> 01:09:35.517]  Do it.
[01:09:35.517 --> 01:09:41.462]  For the last three months, he's been saying, well, in two months, no, he should have a special counsel to expose Mueller.
[01:09:41.462 --> 01:09:43.304]  Well, now Congress is actually looking at that.
[01:09:43.304 --> 01:09:44.705]  So you've trailblazed there.
[01:09:44.705 --> 01:09:50.329]  But you told me this morning, now more than ever, Trump does not need to fire Mueller because the conspiracy has been exposed.
[01:09:50.329 --> 01:09:58.736]  I'm surprised they were arrogant enough to have FBI minutes, memos, emails, text messages with McCabe, who was deputy director at the time.
[01:09:58.736 --> 01:10:01.198]  This is simply incredible that they were this bold.
[01:10:02.077 --> 01:10:03.759]  Alex, it's really extraordinary.
[01:10:03.759 --> 01:10:07.104]  Mueller's public credibility continues to crumble.
[01:10:07.104 --> 01:10:16.517]  The emails, the campaign contributions, the interconnection of the rabid partisans who are working for him.
[01:10:16.517 --> 01:10:19.380]  And as his credibility continues
[01:10:19.981 --> 01:10:20.701]  That's right.
[01:10:38.248 --> 01:10:40.990]  Firing Mueller is unnecessary.
[01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:52.699]  If Mueller has indicted Flynn, if he indicts the President's son-in-law on some phony obstruction of justice or perjury charge, the President has the option now of pardoning both of them.
[01:10:52.699 --> 01:11:01.505]  The President needs to ignore his lawyers when they tell him that he has no authority to direct the actions of the Justice Department.
[01:11:01.505 --> 01:11:01.986]  He does.
[01:11:02.526 --> 01:11:06.348]  The Justice Department is an extension of the executive branch.
[01:11:06.348 --> 01:11:22.058]  He can order Jeff Sessions, he can call him right now and say, I order you to appoint Andrew McCarthy or Andrew Napolitano or Trey Gowdy or Rudy Giuliani as the special counsel to look into Uranium One.
[01:11:22.058 --> 01:11:26.481]  And if Sessions cannot do that or will not, he must step aside.
[01:11:26.481 --> 01:11:28.462]  There's nothing improper on that.
[01:11:28.462 --> 01:11:29.323]  And once Mueller
[01:11:30.063 --> 01:11:36.270]  And Comey, and McCabe, and Rod Rosenstein himself, who was the supervising U.S.
[01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:39.774]  attorney in Uranium One, are under investigation.
[01:11:39.774 --> 01:11:41.956]  They cannot go forward investigating.
[01:11:41.956 --> 01:11:43.878]  And you've got Mueller killing Uranium One.
[01:11:43.878 --> 01:11:47.182]  I mean, these people literally are in a criminal conspiracy.
[01:11:47.182 --> 01:11:49.084]  And it's not just me saying that now.
[01:11:49.084 --> 01:11:51.887]  It's all these... Trey Gowdy, Jim Jordan.
[01:11:53.849 --> 01:11:57.614]  Matt Gaetz, Ron DeSantis, these guys are heroes.
[01:11:57.614 --> 01:12:02.360]  They have courageously gone where the established Republicans will not go.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:08.047]  This whole idea... And they're freaking out, the Democrats are mad that this return America movement...
[01:12:09.116 --> 01:12:09.376]  I think?
[01:12:29.591 --> 01:12:32.415]  But I think we're at the maximum moment of danger here, Roger.
[01:12:32.415 --> 01:12:36.500]  You've got Scarborough and all their talking points saying, we're just going to overthrow Trump.
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:37.722]  We're going to get violent.
[01:12:37.722 --> 01:12:39.024]  Hashtag hunt Republicans.
[01:12:39.024 --> 01:12:47.115]  So these bullies, just like we're some intern that gets our brains bashed out, I guess, these bullies just think that they're going to tell us to fill our hand.
[01:12:47.535 --> 01:12:49.776]  Well, it's a different wing of the same operation.
[01:12:49.776 --> 01:12:51.156]  You were the first one to call this.
[01:12:51.156 --> 01:12:52.797]  This is like the elites.
[01:12:52.797 --> 01:12:54.997]  That's Mueller and the lawyers and the insiders.
[01:12:54.997 --> 01:12:59.119]  And then they have their street thugs, financed by Soros and others.
[01:12:59.119 --> 01:13:01.279]  So they intend to foment a revolution.
[01:13:01.279 --> 01:13:03.960]  Eric Holder has said hit the streets, so it's all coordinated.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:06.501]  Well, the problem is, we're saying hit the streets.
[01:13:06.501 --> 01:13:09.122]  We're telling patriots, no, object.
[01:13:09.122 --> 01:13:12.223]  Do not allow them to take our president down in a coup d'etat.
[01:13:12.523 --> 01:13:13.883]  Here are the facts.
[01:13:13.883 --> 01:13:16.064]  This is a partisan hit squad.
[01:13:16.064 --> 01:13:17.444]  This is a coup d'etat.
[01:13:17.444 --> 01:13:30.988]  This is an illegitimate takedown of the president, not based on evidence in law, but based on animus and hatred and fear that he is challenging the two-party duopoly in the established order.
[01:13:31.628 --> 01:13:36.150]  You know, I have said last week that I think the course is clear, Alex.
[01:13:36.150 --> 01:13:44.053]  Mueller is going to indict the president in some phony process-related charge, obstruction or perjury.
[01:13:44.053 --> 01:13:49.135]  His lawyers are walking him into that, either out of naivete or because they're in on it.
[01:13:49.135 --> 01:13:50.156]  And he needs to put the special...
[01:13:50.876 --> 01:13:51.016]  I'm
[01:14:05.814 --> 01:14:10.278]  Some are saying, no, we need to let the Inspector General do it.
[01:14:10.278 --> 01:14:16.383]  Why suddenly have we seen good news by the Inspector General and the releasing of these emails and things that show the criminal conspiracy?
[01:14:16.383 --> 01:14:19.245]  I think the Inspector General is a good actor.
[01:14:19.245 --> 01:14:21.207]  I think he's doing his job.
[01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:27.912]  I think that the abuses are so glaring, the partisanship is so glaring, that he's doing his job.
[01:14:27.912 --> 01:14:29.774]  I mean, this is like cuckoo land.
[01:14:30.054 --> 01:14:31.775]  Like Hitler sitting over the Nuremberg trial.
[01:14:31.775 --> 01:14:32.696]  I'm not just saying that.
[01:14:32.696 --> 01:14:37.900]  We have them saying, we are frauds, we are liars, we're going to stop the President, we're Democrat operatives.
[01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:40.842]  They all help cover up Clinton crimes on the Russians.
[01:14:40.842 --> 01:14:45.246]  They are covering up by accusing Trump of their crimes at the same damn time.
[01:14:45.606 --> 01:14:53.172]  Well, let's recognize that the President's lawyers, first they told him he would have a letter clearing him from Mueller at Thanksgiving.
[01:14:53.172 --> 01:14:54.153]  And then it was Christmas.
[01:14:54.153 --> 01:14:55.214]  And now it's the new meeting.
[01:14:55.214 --> 01:14:56.615]  And then it was January 1st.
[01:14:56.615 --> 01:14:57.956]  And now it's February 1.
[01:14:57.956 --> 01:15:00.278]  I think that new meeting is going to be shocking to them.
[01:15:00.278 --> 01:15:03.121]  There will be no letters clearing the President.
[01:15:03.621 --> 01:15:17.376]  In fact, I think it is very likely that Jared Kushner will be indicted in regard to the Flynn matter, once again, for a perjury regarding underlying legal activities.
[01:15:17.376 --> 01:15:18.037]  Process.
[01:15:18.037 --> 01:15:18.597]  Process.
[01:15:18.597 --> 01:15:20.319]  Because they don't have anything else.
[01:15:20.319 --> 01:15:23.423]  And that brings it one step closer to the President.
[01:15:24.123 --> 01:15:25.265]  Kushner's done nothing wrong.
[01:15:25.265 --> 01:15:29.330]  But now they're panicking because the fake investigation has been blown sky-high.
[01:15:29.330 --> 01:15:34.015]  They're panicking and now they're going to the final thing, riot the streets, 25th Amendment!
[01:15:34.015 --> 01:15:35.557]  Exactly, that's plan B.
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:38.301]  Man, I've got to brag.
[01:15:38.301 --> 01:15:41.605]  We have called this with total precision.
[01:15:41.605 --> 01:15:44.968]  But I guess we've read hundreds of history books about coup d'etats and these operations.
[01:15:44.968 --> 01:15:45.348]  No, no, no.
[01:15:45.348 --> 01:15:47.491]  We're conspiracy theorists.
[01:15:47.491 --> 01:15:48.492]  Wait and see.
[01:15:48.492 --> 01:15:49.272]  Yeah.
[01:15:49.272 --> 01:15:53.196]  We'll be right back with the calls for fomenting revolution by the left.
[01:15:53.196 --> 01:15:54.217]  Then they're going to blame it on us.
[01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:54.558]  Stay with us.
[01:15:59.505 --> 01:16:00.986]  Hello, Mr. Anderson.
[01:16:00.986 --> 01:16:04.807]  The NSA has noticed how much time you spend on conservative news sites.
[01:16:04.807 --> 01:16:08.689]  We have no choice but to consider you a domestic terrorist.

[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:30.962]  Could you please take a picture of my family and me with my cell phone?
[01:16:30.962 --> 01:16:33.083]  Sure, Mrs. Anderson.
[01:16:33.083 --> 01:16:34.704]  Smile for the camera.
[01:16:34.704 --> 01:16:38.827]  Too bad hackers never get proper permission to access your cell phone or computer camera.

[01:17:27.731 --> 01:17:30.352]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[01:17:30.352 --> 01:17:31.372]  That's true.
[01:17:31.372 --> 01:17:36.434]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still alive?
[01:17:36.434 --> 01:17:41.635]  You can use the life benefits of your life insurance to grow your money with certainty and guarantees.
[01:17:41.635 --> 01:17:45.817]  No stock market risk, no tax risk, and no penalties.

[01:17:58.746 --> 01:18:03.909]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[01:18:03.909 --> 01:18:08.671]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:18:08.671 --> 01:18:16.956]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:18:17.356 --> 01:18:20.859]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics.
[01:18:20.859 --> 01:18:26.103]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:18:26.103 --> 01:18:33.409]  Floralife supports your body's core where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[01:18:33.409 --> 01:18:33.729]  Did you know
[01:18:33.729 --> 01:18:37.312]  Do you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:18:37.312 --> 01:18:42.036]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:18:42.036 --> 01:18:50.122]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
[01:18:50.122 --> 01:18:54.326]  Head to infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.

[01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:02.621]  Fill your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[01:19:02.621 --> 01:19:10.704]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:19:10.704 --> 01:19:16.006]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[01:19:16.006 --> 01:19:18.527]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:19:18.527 --> 01:19:22.748]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:19:22.748 --> 01:19:25.189]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[01:19:25.869 --> 01:19:33.114]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[01:19:33.114 --> 01:19:41.178]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:19:41.178 --> 01:19:48.383]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:19:48.383 --> 01:19:49.824]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[01:19:49.824 --> 01:19:51.645]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[01:19:52.465 --> 01:19:55.930]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[01:19:55.930 --> 01:20:01.939]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:20:01.939 --> 01:20:04.542]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:34.041]  Coming up, Lt.
[01:20:34.041 --> 01:20:34.541]  Col.
[01:20:34.541 --> 01:20:39.726]  Smithmeck will be joining us, who exposed Obama's shipping guns to Hezbollah and ISIS.
[01:20:41.041 --> 01:20:44.684]  Obama went ahead and shipped the next shipments, and that really made the military angry.
[01:20:44.684 --> 01:20:49.408]  I mean, Lieutenant Colonels going public while they're active duty, that is just wild.
[01:20:49.408 --> 01:20:54.172]  This is now in Politico, it's just huge.
[01:20:54.172 --> 01:21:03.640]  We gotta think about the folks, at least three dead, now it's saying 80-something taken to the hospital on a supposedly faster Amtrak train, I guess where it goes like 80 miles an hour instead of 40.
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:09.025]  Of course, you know, the Japanese have them going 250 and so do the Germans, but we don't update our railways.
[01:21:09.625 --> 01:21:13.367]  But we spend millions in taxpayer dollars subsidizing Amtrak.
[01:21:13.367 --> 01:21:14.147]  Billions?
[01:21:14.147 --> 01:21:15.047]  Billions.
[01:21:15.047 --> 01:21:21.570]  And so, uh, yeah, new nice fancy cars, but not a road.
[01:21:21.570 --> 01:21:24.972]  So there it crashes into I-5, killing a bunch of people on the ground.
[01:21:24.972 --> 01:21:31.355]  And I literally was just telling family recently, don't go on that scenic route.
[01:21:31.355 --> 01:21:33.275]  Don't get on an Amtrak.
[01:21:33.275 --> 01:21:34.956]  I mean, you're really putting your life in your hands.
[01:21:34.956 --> 01:21:35.316]  Not safe.
[01:21:35.316 --> 01:21:37.097]  It's not safe.
[01:21:37.097 --> 01:21:38.818]  They're blowing up and crashing all the time.
[01:21:40.109 --> 01:21:46.071]  Despite the fact that we've subsidized Amtrak and it continues to lose money hand over fist.
[01:21:46.071 --> 01:21:48.091]  We need new rail beds!
[01:21:48.091 --> 01:21:49.351]  We need private enterprise.
[01:21:49.351 --> 01:21:50.432]  I agree.
[01:21:50.432 --> 01:21:54.313]  Well, I come from a railroad type family on one side.
[01:21:54.313 --> 01:21:59.174]  And they just grew up talking about this and all the rest of it.
[01:21:59.174 --> 01:22:00.834]  Our railroads have fallen apart.
[01:22:00.834 --> 01:22:03.495]  Let's pray for the folks that are fighting for their lives right now.
[01:22:04.395 --> 01:22:07.959]  But they tell you it's safe and great to get on these and I think it's insane.
[01:22:07.959 --> 01:22:10.282]  We also have just so much huge news.
[01:22:10.282 --> 01:22:15.788]  I want to get this Scarborough article and I want you to ride shotgun with us here throughout the next interview that's coming up.
[01:22:15.788 --> 01:22:18.491]  But Roger, before we play the Scarborough piece, I mean...
[01:22:19.372 --> 01:22:24.094]  Plan A was keep him from getting the nomination and then trying to keep him from being seated as president.
[01:22:24.094 --> 01:22:25.594]  Now they try to sabotage the agenda.
[01:22:25.594 --> 01:22:26.755]  Now they try to have the fake Mueller.
[01:22:26.755 --> 01:22:27.735]  That's blown up.
[01:22:27.735 --> 01:22:36.599]  So now they're going right to the final piece that was rioting in the street and violence and calling for the 25th Amendment to take place, which you first exposed.
[01:22:37.279 --> 01:22:59.159]  You know, I think if Mueller shoots and misses, which is now growingly probable because he's so exposed, he's so naked in terms of his partisanship and the rabid nature of the takedown plan, then the establishment will move to Plan B, which is a 25th Amendment takedown based on the fact that the president is allegedly non-composementist.
[01:22:59.159 --> 01:22:59.599]  He's nuts.
[01:22:59.599 --> 01:23:00.200]  He's crazy.
[01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:01.691]  I've talked to him.
[01:23:01.691 --> 01:23:02.631]  He's sharp as a tack.
[01:23:02.631 --> 01:23:05.713]  He's exactly the same as he was 40 years ago.
[01:23:05.713 --> 01:23:08.595]  So I see no deterioration whatsoever.
[01:23:08.595 --> 01:23:17.922]  But you see Joe Scarborough, Don Lemon, Senator Robert Corker and others, the misfit Keith Olbermann with this meme.
[01:23:17.922 --> 01:23:18.582]  He's nuts.
[01:23:18.582 --> 01:23:19.263]  He's crazy.
[01:23:19.383 --> 01:23:20.343]  He's around the bend.
[01:23:20.343 --> 01:23:22.224]  But you're now willing to not give sources.
[01:23:22.224 --> 01:23:25.785]  Back at the first time you said this, eight months ago, you said, we're not going to give sources.
[01:23:25.785 --> 01:23:30.827]  You said, when the female stuff fails, when the Russian fails, they're going to say he's mentally ill early onset.
[01:23:30.827 --> 01:23:38.349]  And you talk to major writers at major papers who've been in editorial meetings where they talk about, just like Veritas caught it on tape, the whole Russian thing's bull.
[01:23:38.349 --> 01:23:39.429]  What are we going to do?
[01:23:39.429 --> 01:23:40.270]  People aren't buying it.
[01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:45.211]  And they say, don't worry, 25th Amendment, we're going to say he's mentally ill and has Alzheimer's.
[01:23:45.211 --> 01:23:46.312]  You have that from sources.
[01:23:46.312 --> 01:23:47.372]  You didn't just imagine that.
[01:23:47.492 --> 01:23:57.577]  No, look, I spoke to a Trump cabinet member this weekend and I asked them point blank, has there been any discussion about possibly removing the president under the 25th amendment?
[01:23:57.577 --> 01:23:58.918]  Has anybody spoken to you about that?
[01:24:00.009 --> 01:24:01.390]  Poker-faced.
[01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:03.592]  Just poker-faced.
[01:24:03.592 --> 01:24:05.534]  That's how I knew that I was right.
[01:24:05.534 --> 01:24:07.536]  Well, now they're saying it!
[01:24:07.536 --> 01:24:10.719]  Well, we've tracked Senator Ben Sasse talking about it.
[01:24:10.719 --> 01:24:12.800]  We've talked Jeb Bush talking about it.
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:22.129]  We know that Nick Ayers, a high-level aide to Vice President Pence, got busted leaking anti-Trump
[01:24:22.689 --> 01:24:23.931]  He hung up on the President!
[01:24:41.949 --> 01:24:49.375]  And the Republican National Committee and Reince Priebus were contemplating a move to remove Trump as the nominee and replace him with Pence.
[01:24:49.375 --> 01:24:54.660]  We have come within millimeters of not having this American rebirth, and then people expect it to be perfect.
[01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:56.001]  He's totally surrounded.
[01:24:56.001 --> 01:25:01.826]  Here's Bloomberg admitting that all the major cabinet people basically lied to his face and are blocking everything he's trying to do.
[01:25:01.826 --> 01:25:05.890]  But just the little bit he's got through, things are surging back.
[01:25:05.890 --> 01:25:09.393]  I mean, if they're able to deep-six the economy, it's on their chest.
[01:25:09.733 --> 01:25:10.653]  No question about it.
[01:25:10.653 --> 01:25:15.455]  Look, this is the downside of appointing a cabinet of establishment Republicans.
[01:25:15.455 --> 01:25:19.877]  This is the downside of not surrounding yourself with people who don't have your back.
[01:25:19.877 --> 01:25:25.479]  Now, there's a few standouts, there's a few loyalists, Wilbur Ross at Commerce, Linda McMahon, and so on.
[01:25:25.479 --> 01:25:31.081]  But by and large, you have establishment quizlings, people... And Trump just thought, like in business,
[01:25:31.661 --> 01:25:39.410]  Hey, if I bring you in and you have the expertise and I'm the executive, you're not going to hate America, you know, against its own prosperous and your own.
[01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:44.756]  Yes, they are ideologues that were hired to begin with by the globalists because they hate America.
[01:25:44.756 --> 01:25:51.885]  They have an existential lust of defeat it and mount on the wall because they're little beta cup garbage.
[01:25:52.245 --> 01:25:53.986]  Well, and one opens the door to another.
[01:25:53.986 --> 01:25:58.388]  So you hire a Rex Tillerson, and the next thing you know, Condoleezza Rice is running the place.
[01:25:58.388 --> 01:26:02.731]  And all your assistant... But it is good news that Habib Powell got jettisoned out the airlock.
[01:26:03.484 --> 01:26:04.525]  Yes, I think so.
[01:26:04.525 --> 01:26:07.527]  Clearly, she got caught leaking and they had to bounce her.
[01:26:07.527 --> 01:26:14.191]  But McMaster will pace her with another globalist, with another Council on Foreign Relations member.
[01:26:14.191 --> 01:26:24.638]  The President thought, and this isn't naive, that like in all times in American history, once we had an election, America would unite, everybody would support the President because we care about our country.
[01:26:24.638 --> 01:26:29.241]  He just did not understand the deep-seated animus that was happening.
[01:26:29.241 --> 01:26:31.263]  We are living in such an incredible time.
[01:26:31.863 --> 01:26:37.906]  That the FBI would meet on record Democrats on how to engage in fraud and admit it to fraud.
[01:26:37.906 --> 01:26:40.987]  I mean, they are red-handed caught.
[01:26:40.987 --> 01:26:48.791]  And it is a pity because, as you know, the FBI has had in American history this great reputation for probity and honesty and impartiality.
[01:26:49.891 --> 01:26:54.435]  This is not meant to denigrate the men and women at the lower levels of the FBI who are the average agent.
[01:26:54.435 --> 01:26:56.056]  They're just trying to do their job.
[01:26:56.056 --> 01:26:59.178]  But at the top, this is rotten to the core.
[01:26:59.178 --> 01:27:05.042]  It has become a politicized... It's become a Democratic Party whorehouse with a bunch of arrogant cucks that think they're God.
[01:27:05.202 --> 01:27:12.366]  Well, I would argue that it's become a globalist establishment whorehouse because guys like Mueller do dirty work for the Bushes and the Clintons.
[01:27:12.366 --> 01:27:15.408]  And they sell out to all these offshore globalists in foreign countries.
[01:27:15.408 --> 01:27:16.749]  In fact, they're not Russian agents.
[01:27:16.749 --> 01:27:17.949]  They're not Chinese agents.
[01:27:17.949 --> 01:27:20.711]  They are pimping us out.
[01:27:20.711 --> 01:27:22.112]  They are selling us out.
[01:27:22.112 --> 01:27:25.093]  They are sitting there as a clearinghouse, selling out the country.
[01:27:25.093 --> 01:27:25.974]  And look at it!
[01:27:25.974 --> 01:27:31.297]  Well, they have no ideology other than the ideology of greed and power and money and control.
[01:27:32.057 --> 01:27:36.080]  And a disdain for the little person and a disdain for open democracy.
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:37.921]  But they're not Republicans or Democrats.
[01:27:37.921 --> 01:27:39.142]  They're not left or right.
[01:27:39.142 --> 01:27:41.183]  They're just evil!

[01:33:14.062 --> 01:33:21.606]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:21.606 --> 01:33:31.413]  Alright, we're monitoring the Amtrak derailment that's killed at least three people and now over 85 injured crashing through.
[01:33:32.904 --> 01:33:36.827]  The bridge and down into I-5 there in Washington State.
[01:33:36.827 --> 01:33:37.588]  Truly a tragedy.
[01:33:37.588 --> 01:33:38.348]  We'll be watching that.
[01:33:38.348 --> 01:33:41.431]  Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign, riding shotgun with us.
[01:33:41.431 --> 01:33:44.053]  But this news broke this morning.
[01:33:44.053 --> 01:33:50.478]  And Matt, one of the great producers, brought it to my attention and said, didn't you cover this back in March of last year, almost a year and a half ago?
[01:33:51.518 --> 01:33:53.079]  Or I guess a year and a half ago or more.
[01:33:53.079 --> 01:33:56.622]  The secret backstory of how Obama let Hezbollah off the hook.
[01:33:56.622 --> 01:33:58.464]  That's out of politico.
[01:33:58.464 --> 01:34:02.026]  Let them deal cocaine, let them buy arms.
[01:34:02.026 --> 01:34:07.330]  Now that's what I was told by Tosh Plumlee, CIA whistleblower, and so many others off record.
[01:34:07.330 --> 01:34:14.676]  So Adon Salazar wrote the article breaking Fast and Furious with secret program to ship arms to Middle East terrorists, ISIS and Hezbollah.
[01:34:14.676 --> 01:34:15.557]  To just destabilize.
[01:34:15.557 --> 01:34:16.878]  That's what Obama wanted.
[01:34:18.143 --> 01:34:22.306]  Now, we've got Matt Smith-Mack, who was retiring at the time.
[01:34:22.306 --> 01:34:23.527]  He's now retired.
[01:34:23.527 --> 01:34:25.468]  20-year veteran USMC.
[01:34:25.468 --> 01:34:33.133]  I'm not going to go over his whole background in anti-terrorism and everything he's done, but he retired as a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps.
[01:34:33.133 --> 01:34:39.077]  And again, he's been on Judge Advocate, tribunal members, and chief of staff.
[01:34:39.077 --> 01:34:40.758]  And so he had a really great career there.
[01:34:40.758 --> 01:34:42.279]  He was physically attacked
[01:34:43.342 --> 01:34:49.847]  When he began to whistle below by folks from behind, and so we've had Tosh Plumley's left the country over all this.
[01:34:49.847 --> 01:34:51.088]  This is very serious.
[01:34:51.088 --> 01:34:52.869]  But now they're being forced to admit it.
[01:34:52.869 --> 01:34:57.652]  So this wasn't just Fast and Furious with some guns from some gun stores.
[01:34:57.652 --> 01:34:58.913]  That was just the cover.
[01:34:58.913 --> 01:35:02.056]  And a lot of this was classified, so Matt couldn't get into a lot of it.
[01:35:02.056 --> 01:35:04.958]  But he could say, hey, more shipments are about to happen under Obama.
[01:35:05.518 --> 01:35:07.999]  We need to stop it, and here's the base they're coming out of.
[01:35:07.999 --> 01:35:10.980]  So, he was exposing real treason.
[01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:12.881]  Well, sometimes these things take time.
[01:35:12.881 --> 01:35:17.663]  Here we are a year and a half later, now Trump, the FBI, is looking into it.
[01:35:17.663 --> 01:35:30.208]  So Matt, I know you can't get into a lot of details of it, but as much as you can here, obviously, recapping, and this is right in the same area that you were talking about and dealing with and the accusations you made here on the broadcast in March of 2016.
[01:35:30.208 --> 01:35:33.309]  So Matt Smith, thanks for coming on.
[01:35:35.578 --> 01:35:40.281]  Hey, Mr. Jones, thank you very much, and thank you for inviting me back on.
[01:35:40.281 --> 01:35:46.864]  Yeah, I tell you, it's timely, and it's truthful, as I had spoken your program before.
[01:35:46.864 --> 01:36:04.234]  You know, the Fast and Furious, and I can give you some additional information from February of this year onward that I'll get into, but you talk about, we knew weapons were coming to the Middle East when some of these groups of, you know, kids, I use that in air quotes, that ATF and those guys had utilized,
[01:36:05.351 --> 01:36:16.782]  Uh, several, on more than three occasions, ran weapons through Lupo, Arizona, down Route 2 to Caborca, Mexico, where, you know, these kids who were involved in this, they'll talk about meeting with U.S.
[01:36:16.782 --> 01:36:29.854]  government officials and people of Middle Eastern descent for the weapons going, going to the Middle East, you know, and, uh, about a month after that first shipment of, uh, you know, in about September of
[01:36:31.131 --> 01:36:43.218]  2010 or so, you had the DSP commander with their internal security in Morocco stating, to his appearance, that fast and furious weapons were coming into the kingdom.
[01:36:43.218 --> 01:36:52.604]  So yes, fast and furious was what we know it to be, weapons running south, the US government running south, weapons to a little cartel.
[01:36:52.604 --> 01:36:57.527]  And save for the brave people like, you know, Vence Cuffalo and J. Dobbin, John Dodson, who
[01:36:58.243 --> 01:37:01.664]  You know, Alex, these were trusted, respected federal agents.
[01:37:01.664 --> 01:37:03.305]  They speak the truth.
[01:37:03.305 --> 01:37:07.986]  And then they have, uh, they become enemies of the state, which is, uh, which is disheartening.
[01:37:07.986 --> 01:37:15.449]  And if I, if I might, there was another Border Patrol BORTAC agent named William Neal Anderson.
[01:37:15.449 --> 01:37:19.430]  He died a suspect causes in February of this year.
[01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:25.172]  He was one of the body, one of the people who carried Brian Terry's body out of Tech Canyon, right?
[01:37:25.172 --> 01:37:26.793]  And we know from the medical examiner's report,
[01:37:27.483 --> 01:37:35.387]  That Brian Turrey, from the moment when he shot, when he was on the medal examiner's table, Alex, was only 90 minutes.
[01:37:35.387 --> 01:37:38.269]  Now it's Arizona and it's December, but it's not the Antarctic.
[01:37:38.269 --> 01:37:42.931]  He had full rigor set in, right, into Brian Turrey's body, according to the report.
[01:37:43.619 --> 01:37:51.709]  With that, you fast forward a little bit, that's the memorial service for Brian Turrey, Neil, again, at this point, a Vortec agent.
[01:37:51.709 --> 01:38:02.581]  And again, Matt, I'm going to have you back for a full hour sometime this week, or soon, because you can go over the whole story of people being killed for leaking this info, what all of you have gone through, because it's beyond a...
[01:38:03.482 --> 01:38:28.671]  James Bond movie or beyond, you know, some of the films we've seen about intrigue, but bottom line, you've got weapons being shipped out, being sent to the Middle East, being sent to Hezbollah, being sent to ISIS, and we now know that Obama blocked the FBI, the ATF, the Border Patrol, and all these groups in this big thick article just confirming the whole type of stuff with these
[01:38:30.219 --> 01:38:41.691]  Different Middle Eastern based cells and that Obama knew this was going on and blocked investigators even letting them deal the drugs on the ground here in the U.S., sell the drugs here on the ground in the U.S.
[01:38:41.691 --> 01:38:43.273]  as part of a larger operation.
[01:38:43.273 --> 01:38:47.557]  So this just confirms into the whole area the outrageousness of this.
[01:38:47.557 --> 01:38:49.439]  This isn't just Obama, Roger Stone.
[01:38:51.882 --> 01:38:54.145]  Turning a blind eye, that's how they're whitewashing it.
[01:38:54.145 --> 01:39:05.919]  This is confirming everything that the Colonel Smith-Meck has talked about, and he's trying to remember the men who blew the whistle who would end up getting dead, and they'd find in their boots, you know, at home, hey, if I get killed, here's really the story.
[01:39:05.919 --> 01:39:07.741]  I mean, that's the whole incredible backside of this.
[01:39:07.941 --> 01:39:14.865]  Yet Joe Biden goes on CBS this morning, last week, and says, oh, eight years of Obama-Biden and not a hint of scandal.
[01:39:14.865 --> 01:39:16.266]  Really, Mr. Vice President?
[01:39:16.266 --> 01:39:17.507]  What about this scandal?
[01:39:17.507 --> 01:39:25.231]  What about the lies and the perjury of Eric Holder, the attorney general who oversaw this monstrosity?
[01:39:25.231 --> 01:39:27.973]  I mean, imagine shipping out of Marine Corps bases.
[01:39:29.102 --> 01:39:32.843]  Huge truckloads of guns to kill Marines.
[01:39:32.843 --> 01:39:33.784]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:39:33.784 --> 01:39:34.704]  It's outrageous.
[01:39:34.704 --> 01:39:36.005]  It's treasonous.
[01:39:36.005 --> 01:39:40.686]  And it's a massive scandal, which we only learned about now, not while Obama's in office.
[01:39:40.686 --> 01:39:48.409]  Well, Matt, I'm going to give you the last few minutes we have, but please try to book out some time to come on via Skype or phone again later in the week.
[01:39:48.409 --> 01:39:49.330]  We salute your courage.
[01:39:49.330 --> 01:39:50.810]  You've been totally vindicated.
[01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:52.871]  This is whole other even giant areas.
[01:39:53.251 --> 01:39:56.012]  Not even related to what you broke, but also related to what you broke.
[01:39:56.012 --> 01:39:58.353]  It's just incredible how big this was.
[01:39:58.353 --> 01:39:59.854]  You were seeing one part of it.
[01:39:59.854 --> 01:40:00.975]  How big do you think this was?
[01:40:10.819 --> 01:40:28.504]  The telling part to me is when federal agents of character and courage, some, thank God, still alive, like the folks I mentioned, but also others like Brian Terry and William Neil Anderson, they speak up, they do the right thing, and they wind up dead because they become a threat to whatever pathetic
[01:40:30.623 --> 01:40:31.383]  We're good to go.
[01:40:51.465 --> 01:40:52.646]  Well, he's trying.
[01:40:52.646 --> 01:40:53.847]  He is completely surrounded.
[01:40:53.847 --> 01:40:54.587]  They admit he is.
[01:40:54.587 --> 01:40:56.969]  They're now moving to kill him.
[01:40:56.969 --> 01:41:04.894]  That's the word publicly and privately, and they're calling for the civil insurrection to begin on mainstream news to try to stop the restoration of the republic.
[01:41:04.894 --> 01:41:10.258]  We're in a literal fight to restore the republic from multinational interests that have seized the nation.
[01:41:10.798 --> 01:41:21.383]  I had a senior Democrat operative walk up to me on the street, somebody I've known for 30 years, a very serious person, and he said to me, well, Roger, who will assassinate the president first?
[01:41:21.383 --> 01:41:24.605]  Will it be a foreign power or will we do it?
[01:41:24.605 --> 01:41:26.966]  That's the mentality in Washington right now.
[01:41:26.966 --> 01:41:28.787]  The president's in grave danger.
[01:41:28.787 --> 01:41:32.008]  There is a multi-level coup d'etat in the works.
[01:41:32.008 --> 01:41:37.811]  And there's this arrogance to talk about it by all these scumbags because they think that they're going to get away with it.
[01:41:39.103 --> 01:41:45.127]  That Rosenstein performance before the House Intelligence Committee was the most incredible tap-dancing I have ever seen.
[01:41:45.127 --> 01:41:47.909]  This guy can't see the nose on the end of his face.
[01:41:47.909 --> 01:41:52.813]  It is so clear that Mueller is in the tank and that this is a get-Trump-hit squad.
[01:41:52.813 --> 01:41:53.594]  All right.
[01:41:53.594 --> 01:41:57.657]  Matt Smithmech, retired Lieutenant Colonel, we appreciate your courage.
[01:41:57.657 --> 01:42:00.919]  Please come on later in the week for a full hour and we'll get you on Skype.
[01:42:00.919 --> 01:42:02.321]  We've got a good, clear connection.
[01:42:02.321 --> 01:42:02.761]  Can you do that?
[01:42:03.729 --> 01:42:04.570]  Yes sir, you bet.
[01:42:04.570 --> 01:42:05.370]  At your convenience.
[01:42:05.370 --> 01:42:05.871]  Alright, thank you.
[01:42:05.871 --> 01:42:06.851]  No, whenever you can.
[01:42:06.851 --> 01:42:07.952]  Thank you, sir.
[01:42:07.952 --> 01:42:10.854]  And again, the whole story is just incredible.
[01:42:10.854 --> 01:42:13.436]  People keep saying, oh, these feds are corrupt.
[01:42:13.436 --> 01:42:15.778]  When they try to not be corrupt, they get killed.
[01:42:15.778 --> 01:42:20.162]  And this is Obama literally funding the radical Muslims.
[01:42:20.162 --> 01:42:23.324]  Using our money, our weapons.
[01:42:23.324 --> 01:42:24.685]  He didn't just do it to destabilize.
[01:42:24.685 --> 01:42:25.766]  He was a jihadi.
[01:42:25.766 --> 01:42:27.007]  He is a globalist.
[01:42:27.007 --> 01:42:29.709]  These people are sick and busted.
[01:42:30.964 --> 01:42:31.845]  Well, that's another thing.
[01:42:31.845 --> 01:42:33.906]  I mean, imagine what else is going to come out.
[01:42:33.906 --> 01:42:43.992]  We're going to come back and get to Scarborough and others basically calling for civil war in America, claiming we're calling for it with Roger Stone.
[01:42:43.992 --> 01:42:49.395]  By the way, Roger Stone just won the big defamation case that they ran against him, the Democratic Party funded.
[01:42:49.395 --> 01:42:51.716]  He's got Obama suing him as well.
[01:42:51.716 --> 01:42:52.337]  So we'll be back.
[01:42:57.569 --> 01:43:05.037]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:43:05.037 --> 01:43:18.250]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[01:43:31.097 --> 01:43:37.064]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:02.822]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:45:02.822 --> 01:45:13.332]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:45:13.332 --> 01:45:16.696]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[01:45:17.216 --> 01:45:17.576]  Thank you.
[01:45:17.576 --> 01:45:18.076]  Absolutely.
[01:45:39.924 --> 01:45:52.835]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:45:57.609 --> 01:46:05.871]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[01:46:05.871 --> 01:46:07.091]  A 360 win.
[01:46:07.091 --> 01:46:13.632]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[01:46:13.632 --> 01:46:21.154]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:46:21.574 --> 01:46:26.657]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:46:26.657 --> 01:46:32.761]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:46:32.761 --> 01:46:40.546]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:46:40.546 --> 01:46:47.750]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:48.551]  10% off on AutoShip.
[01:46:48.971 --> 01:46:51.152]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[01:46:51.152 --> 01:46:53.133]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:46:53.133 --> 01:47:01.458]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:47:01.458 --> 01:47:04.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:37.404 --> 01:47:40.185]  Roger Stone is our guest.
[01:47:40.185 --> 01:47:41.526]  This all ties together.
[01:47:41.526 --> 01:47:43.947]  Trump is not firing Mueller.
[01:47:43.947 --> 01:47:44.887]  Mueller is in trouble.
[01:47:44.887 --> 01:47:48.549]  This whole fraud is disintegrating.
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:53.504]  So now they're going to say, oh, he is firing Mueller.
[01:47:53.504 --> 01:47:57.549]  So they can create all this anger and consternation, act like, oh, look, he's guilty.
[01:47:57.549 --> 01:48:04.657]  And they're hoping that story clouds the hearings, where we've now learned.
[01:48:06.107 --> 01:48:11.090]  The truth about the Russia collusion story being a manufactured hoax.
[01:48:11.090 --> 01:48:15.734]  This is confirmed in the emails, the text messages, with the current FBI director.
[01:48:15.734 --> 01:48:25.300]  Wow, that's a great example of how Trump's got bad people advising him that that's who the Justice Department put in to replace corrupt Comey.
[01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:27.242]  Oh, you're getting rid of corrupt Comey?
[01:48:27.242 --> 01:48:31.905]  Here's the guy, the ringleader of Russiagate, confirmed he'll be your new FBI head.
[01:48:32.225 --> 01:48:33.905]  Yeah, no, it's extraordinary.
[01:48:33.905 --> 01:48:35.686]  Notice where this story came from.
[01:48:35.686 --> 01:48:38.427]  Trump is going to fire Mueller.
[01:48:38.427 --> 01:48:42.148]  The person who puts that out is Congresswoman Jackie Speier.
[01:48:42.148 --> 01:48:45.088]  Speier rhymes with liar.
[01:48:45.088 --> 01:48:59.612]  This is a grand strategy of Adam Schiff, the rabid left-wing congressman from California who doesn't want to end the Russian probe despite the fact that we've spent millions of hours and millions of dollars and come up with nothing.
[01:49:00.052 --> 01:49:03.416]  So we put Spire out there to whip up a hysteria.
[01:49:03.416 --> 01:49:05.558]  Oh, Trump is about to fire Mueller.
[01:49:05.558 --> 01:49:07.200]  How would she know?
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:08.621]  How in the world would she know?
[01:49:08.621 --> 01:49:13.246]  I don't think the president has any intention of filing Mueller.
[01:49:13.246 --> 01:49:17.871]  Never interfere with your enemy when he's in the process of destroying himself.
[01:49:18.912 --> 01:49:20.635]  The guy's shorts are showing.
[01:49:20.635 --> 01:49:27.244]  It's clear that this is nothing but a rabid, partisan takedown, infected with hate.
[01:49:27.244 --> 01:49:31.330]  Trump, by the way, you just won a big defamation case in New York.
[01:49:33.041 --> 01:49:37.903]  Yeah, I was charged with defaming this gadfly sore loser candidate.
[01:49:37.903 --> 01:49:39.463]  Well, let's not even get his name, you know.
[01:49:39.463 --> 01:49:41.224]  No, we don't need to.
[01:49:41.224 --> 01:49:50.808]  But it went to a Manhattan jury, Democratic Timoney judge, six Manhattan jurors, all registered Democrats, George Soros' people financing the suit.
[01:49:52.223 --> 01:49:53.645]  And the court found no cause.
[01:49:53.645 --> 01:49:55.786]  They dismissed the case in record time.
[01:49:55.786 --> 01:50:02.432]  And describe, you told me on the phone, that literal soros lawyers came in, and you said that it was like they were punched in the stomach when they lost.
[01:50:02.432 --> 01:50:11.299]  Well, I had two co-defendants, Carl Palladino, who is the chairman of the Trump campaign in New York and a great patriot, and Michael Caputo, a longtime associate of mine.
[01:50:11.299 --> 01:50:20.647]  The judge dismissed the trial, the case against both of them based on motion, and then he let my charge go to the jury, despite the fact that the charges against us were identical.
[01:50:21.347 --> 01:50:23.168]  Assuming that the jury would convict.
[01:50:23.168 --> 01:50:35.053]  Well, the jury, those fine Americans, would be able to look beyond the fact that they don't agree with me politically, but I had no connection whatsoever to defaming this guy, and there were multiple others who may have done so.
[01:50:35.053 --> 01:50:45.958]  The Soros lawyers, who I believe financed this case and kept it alive, it looked like they'd been kicked in the stomach when the foreman of the jury handed the not guilty verdict to the judge.
[01:50:46.238 --> 01:50:52.103]  And they admit, even in Politico, that Obama's law firm and people he hired are suing you and the President.
[01:50:53.334 --> 01:50:56.655]  An unprecedented case with no evidence for being Russian agents.
[01:50:56.655 --> 01:51:14.800]  What's extraordinary is that the top line of the Obama NSA, Clapper, Brennan, the Islamic convert, Hayden, the guy who had the job under Bush, have filed this extraordinary amicus brief in the case, as have the top aides to John McCain.
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:15.760]  They say it's secret!
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:18.621]  And we can't testify, but the Russians did it.
[01:51:18.621 --> 01:51:21.761]  It's just a regurgitation of their same old lie.
[01:51:21.761 --> 01:51:26.143]  They just believe if you keep saying it over and over again, you don't need to produce evidence.
[01:51:26.143 --> 01:51:27.623]  We're the CIA!
[01:51:27.623 --> 01:51:28.503]  We're the NSA!
[01:51:28.503 --> 01:51:29.604]  Why would we lie?
[01:51:29.604 --> 01:51:34.285]  So they use their authority and their credibility because of their former titles.
[01:51:35.425 --> 01:51:38.146]  But they don't produce anything new.
[01:51:38.146 --> 01:51:40.067]  But I don't get to cross-examine them.
[01:51:40.067 --> 01:51:45.970]  They can butt into this case and make these false assertions, but I'm not allowed to question them under oath.
[01:51:45.970 --> 01:51:46.891]  Seems unfair to me.
[01:51:47.921 --> 01:51:51.963]  All right, when we go to break here in a few minutes, we're gonna have some surprise guests here in studio.
[01:51:51.963 --> 01:52:06.631]  I promised you guys some spectacular things here during the Christmas extravaganza that we'd have on Monday, part of this 34-hour broadcast that runs through today, through tomorrow with myself, Owen Schroer, and a bunch of other special guests that'll be here like Roger Stone in studio.
[01:52:08.277 --> 01:52:17.525]  I haven't even gotten to the Scarborough stuff yet, and I have Craig Sawyer, a former member of, and leader, not commander, but leader in SEAL Team 6.
[01:52:17.525 --> 01:52:18.746]  He hates when I even talk about that.
[01:52:18.746 --> 01:52:24.290]  The point is he's a great guy, and he's the host of Top Shots and all his shows on TV.
[01:52:24.290 --> 01:52:33.257]  They have gotten authorization from law enforcement to actually follow them on the raids, rescuing children that have been kidnapped for sex slavery.
[01:52:33.257 --> 01:52:34.819]  And you've seen all the big busts that are happening.
[01:52:36.008 --> 01:52:45.385]  And behind the scenes, you know, I've been financing some of this, but they've gotten the green light from law enforcement to show some of this, exclusively here first, coming up.
[01:52:47.102 --> 01:52:52.725]  What's been missing is, when they bust the pedophiles, then it all goes into court and gets shut down.
[01:52:52.725 --> 01:52:55.366]  News has got to be there when it first begins.
[01:52:55.366 --> 01:52:55.766]  Okay?
[01:52:55.766 --> 01:53:05.791]  In the raid park, kind of like a cop show, but you're not busting winos and crackheads and, you know, hillbillies, which is entertaining, but it's, you know, not that important at the end of the day, compared to pedophiles.
[01:53:05.791 --> 01:53:11.654]  And they've got like a bad boys, bad boys, what you gonna do, what you gonna do when they come for you, but instead it's helicopters.
[01:53:12.034 --> 01:53:28.685]  Coming up next hour, Roger Stone will ride shotgun with us, and then we've got some other special guests as well coming up in that little short five minute segment that's about to happen.
[01:53:28.685 --> 01:53:32.487]  I haven't gotten to Scarborough yet and all the rest of it, but this is a big deal.
[01:53:32.487 --> 01:53:34.108]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:53:35.888 --> 01:53:37.649]  The Globalists have tried to shut down our sponsors.
[01:53:37.649 --> 01:53:39.009]  They've tried to destroy us.
[01:53:39.009 --> 01:53:41.770]  Despite that, we have swum upstream thanks to you.
[01:53:41.770 --> 01:53:42.350]  And I mean that.
[01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:43.910]  It's you.

[01:54:40.787 --> 01:54:41.848]  They work different for others, but...
[01:54:42.808 --> 01:54:44.069]  Males is what it's designed for.
[01:54:44.069 --> 01:54:44.910]  Works great with females.
[01:54:44.910 --> 01:54:49.014]  Stamina, libido, libido, libido, energy.
[01:54:49.014 --> 01:54:50.155]  It's so strong I can't even take it.
[01:54:50.155 --> 01:54:51.797]  Alex, I don't know how you do these discounts.

[01:56:37.729 --> 01:56:45.315]  Now, most areas in the lower 48, you can even order tomorrow and still get it, maybe even Wednesday or Thursday, but if you want it anywhere, guaranteed, this is the way to do it.
[01:56:45.315 --> 01:56:47.877]  You can also just put in the email note on your ticket

[01:57:14.184 --> 01:57:20.252]  And again, I then think whatever the best information warfare is, I take the money and I spend it on the info war.
[01:57:20.252 --> 01:57:23.076]  Like, I don't have a piece of this TV show that Craig Soares is producing.
[01:57:23.076 --> 01:57:24.037]  I didn't want it when they offered it.
[01:57:24.037 --> 01:57:25.459]  I just said, look, I trust you.
[01:57:25.459 --> 01:57:26.020]  You're a great guy.
[01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:27.221]  I highly recommend it.
[01:57:27.221 --> 01:57:28.202]  Here's $100,000 and I'm not made of money.

[01:57:34.809 --> 01:57:38.373]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.

[01:57:47.341 --> 01:57:51.962]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.
[01:57:51.962 --> 01:57:59.624]  InfoWars Life brings you a revolutionary toothpaste blend with iodine and nano silver designed to deliver a powerful clean.
[01:57:59.624 --> 01:58:03.845]  Enjoy a minty fresh flavor made with peppermint oil or try our bubblegum flavor.
[01:58:03.845 --> 01:58:09.806]  Pair this groundbreaking toothpaste with a super blue fluoride free mouthwash and supercharge your oral health.
[01:58:09.986 --> 01:58:16.589]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[01:58:16.589 --> 01:58:26.974]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[01:58:26.974 --> 01:58:33.757]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[01:58:33.757 --> 01:58:36.338]  Xylitol, Nano-Silver, and Iodine.
[01:58:36.618 --> 01:58:40.242]  Notice the difference with our super blue fluoride free products.

[01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:54.102]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[01:58:54.102 --> 01:58:58.865]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:58:58.865 --> 01:59:07.568]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:59:07.568 --> 01:59:10.930]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics and
[01:59:11.050 --> 01:59:16.292]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:59:16.292 --> 01:59:23.615]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[01:59:23.615 --> 01:59:27.517]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:59:27.517 --> 01:59:32.239]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:59:32.239 --> 01:59:39.902]  Floralife is sold as a $15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a $50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
[01:59:40.322 --> 01:59:44.223]  Head to Infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
[01:59:44.223 --> 01:59:51.405]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:51.405 --> 02:00:02.669]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:02.669 --> 02:00:07.690]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:00:07.690 --> 02:00:09.151]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.806 --> 02:00:18.889]  I don't know what that noise is.
[02:00:18.889 --> 02:00:20.651]  I'm hearing some jingling, Roger.
[02:00:20.651 --> 02:00:21.853]  We're going to check into it in a minute.
[02:00:21.853 --> 02:00:23.875]  A lot of big serious news day out there.
[02:00:23.875 --> 02:00:29.583]  But, you know, I've actually decided, and done my own research, that I'm wrong.
[02:00:29.583 --> 02:00:31.426]  That I'm a bad person.
[02:00:31.426 --> 02:00:32.807]  I decided Obamacare is free.
[02:00:34.484 --> 02:00:34.764]  I think?
[02:00:51.934 --> 02:00:54.975]  I've discovered that Santa Claus is real.
[02:00:54.975 --> 02:01:04.277]  You know, I always thought, since I was a little kid, I hear some jingling over there, I always thought that Santa Claus wasn't real, but actually, Santa Claus sent a couple of emissaries.
[02:01:04.277 --> 02:01:06.858]  We've got a camera shot five, please.
[02:01:06.858 --> 02:01:12.760]  Yes, Santa Claus did send emissaries, and ladies and gentlemen, here are those emissaries now.
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:13.320]  Go to camera five.
[02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:15.762]  Here they are, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:15.762 --> 02:01:21.206]  Ladies and gentlemen, from the North Pole, Mimi, oh my gosh, and Shorty.
[02:01:21.206 --> 02:01:23.148]  Thank you, it's very nice to meet you guys.
[02:01:23.148 --> 02:01:24.089]  Nice to meet you, too.
[02:01:24.089 --> 02:01:24.849]  How you doing?
[02:01:24.849 --> 02:01:25.250]  Good, good.
[02:01:25.250 --> 02:01:26.571]  Been busy staying in the North Pole.
[02:01:26.571 --> 02:01:34.217]  Bad news, but along with that, we're just here to bring some Christmas cheer to make you happy and bring lots of gifts and goodies.
[02:01:34.217 --> 02:01:34.698]  Well, thank you.
[02:01:34.698 --> 02:01:36.119]  Does Santa like me?
[02:01:36.119 --> 02:01:38.341]  Yes, he does.
[02:01:38.341 --> 02:01:40.923]  Did Santa vote for President Trump?
[02:01:41.619 --> 02:01:44.562]  Yeah, he did.
[02:01:44.562 --> 02:01:46.404]  Well, you know, Santa is a racist.
[02:01:46.404 --> 02:01:47.685]  I mean, he's white.
[02:01:47.685 --> 02:01:49.267]  He's an effing white male.
[02:01:49.267 --> 02:01:51.309]  And he wears a red suit, let's be clear.
[02:01:51.309 --> 02:01:53.851]  Hey, he picks on midgets too, the hells.
[02:01:53.851 --> 02:01:55.833]  Absolutely, he like bosses you around.
[02:01:55.833 --> 02:01:58.496]  He likes, he don't like the mean ones.
[02:01:58.496 --> 02:02:00.418]  That's it, that's just my buddy here.
[02:02:00.418 --> 02:02:02.920]  But he likes the sweet and gentle ones.
[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:04.382]  Because they're the ones that give him all the goodies.
[02:02:04.662 --> 02:02:06.765]  Well, you guys are going to be co-hosting with me tonight.
[02:02:06.765 --> 02:02:08.747]  This is going on for 30-something hours.
[02:02:08.747 --> 02:02:12.992]  So tonight, for a couple hours, you're going to co-host with me and Alexa.
[02:02:12.992 --> 02:02:15.636]  Oh, Alexa's here, the AI globalist system.
[02:02:15.636 --> 02:02:17.898]  Alexa, what are elves?
[02:02:20.310 --> 02:02:28.893]  Economist individuals or covert cells who, according to the ELF press office, use economic sabotage and guerrilla warfare to... Oh my God!
[02:02:28.893 --> 02:02:30.773]  Arrest these people!
[02:02:30.773 --> 02:02:32.954]  Arrest these people immediately!
[02:02:32.954 --> 02:02:33.894]  Alexa!
[02:02:33.894 --> 02:02:36.775]  Alexa, that sounds like Democrats!
[02:02:36.775 --> 02:02:41.076]  That's a Democrat, not an elf!
[02:02:41.076 --> 02:02:42.517]  Alexa!
[02:02:42.517 --> 02:02:43.997]  Alexa!
[02:02:43.997 --> 02:02:45.438]  What is an elf?
[02:02:45.438 --> 02:02:48.499]  Not the Animal Liberation Army, but what is an elf?
[02:02:51.468 --> 02:02:54.149]  Here's something I found on Wikipedia.
[02:02:54.149 --> 02:03:00.771]  The Earth Liberation Front, ELF, also known as Elves or the Elves, is the collective name for autonomous individuals.
[02:03:00.771 --> 02:03:01.471]  See, everything is left.
[02:03:01.471 --> 02:03:02.171]  Just be quiet.
[02:03:02.171 --> 02:03:03.151]  Be quiet.
[02:03:03.151 --> 02:03:05.232]  We're not like this.
[02:03:05.232 --> 02:03:07.032]  Quiet, Alexa.
[02:03:07.032 --> 02:03:08.153]  I voted for chair.
[02:03:08.153 --> 02:03:09.173]  I made a stop.
[02:03:09.173 --> 02:03:11.234]  Here's something I found on Wikipedia.
[02:03:11.234 --> 02:03:11.714]  Stop.
[02:03:11.714 --> 02:03:12.154]  Stop.
[02:03:12.154 --> 02:03:12.414]  Stop.
[02:03:12.414 --> 02:03:12.774]  Stop.
[02:03:12.774 --> 02:03:12.954]  Stop.
[02:03:12.954 --> 02:03:13.054]  Stop.
[02:03:13.054 --> 02:03:13.254]  Stop.
[02:03:13.254 --> 02:03:13.654]  Stop.
[02:03:13.654 --> 02:03:14.174]  Alexa, stop.
[02:03:19.736 --> 02:03:23.479]  Yeah, I know they said Jesus Christ was a fictional character.
[02:03:23.479 --> 02:03:25.220]  Let me get serious!
[02:03:25.220 --> 02:03:25.800]  Be quiet!
[02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:27.281]  Be quiet, Alexa!
[02:03:27.281 --> 02:03:27.962]  Alexa!
[02:03:27.962 --> 02:03:30.764]  Oh, that's it's trigger word.
[02:03:30.764 --> 02:03:31.965]  Alexa!
[02:03:31.965 --> 02:03:33.386]  Sorry, I'm not sure.
[02:03:33.386 --> 02:03:37.669]  Alexa, is Santa Claus real?
[02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:41.752]  I don't know him personally, but I've heard a lot of good things about Santa.
[02:03:41.752 --> 02:03:44.654]  If I ever meet him, I'll tell you.
[02:03:44.654 --> 02:03:49.157]  Alexa, but they teach at universities that he's an effing white male.
[02:03:53.948 --> 02:03:56.951]  Let me ask you another question, Alexa.
[02:03:56.951 --> 02:03:59.994]  Alexa, I'm actually here with real elves.
[02:03:59.994 --> 02:04:00.934]  What would you like to say with them?
[02:04:05.236 --> 02:04:06.377]  There you go.
[02:04:06.377 --> 02:04:06.837]  The A.I.
[02:04:06.837 --> 02:04:07.398]  doesn't like you.
[02:04:07.398 --> 02:04:08.859]  Guys, you are awesome.
[02:04:08.859 --> 02:04:09.339]  I can't wait.
[02:04:09.339 --> 02:04:10.660]  I'm going to see you more later in the hour.
[02:04:10.660 --> 02:04:11.521]  Go get some lunch.
[02:04:11.521 --> 02:04:15.724]  We got some lunch in there before you get back on your sleigh and everything and fly away.
[02:04:15.724 --> 02:04:17.165]  There's your news, too.
[02:04:17.165 --> 02:04:17.445]  Thank you.
[02:04:17.445 --> 02:04:18.686]  Oh, you brought me news!
[02:04:18.686 --> 02:04:20.627]  Amtrak derailment train crashes.
[02:04:20.627 --> 02:04:21.648]  That's sad to hear, isn't it?
[02:04:21.648 --> 02:04:22.649]  Yeah, that's sad.
[02:04:22.649 --> 02:04:23.409]  Bad news.
[02:04:23.409 --> 02:04:24.430]  And don't blame it on the hills.
[02:04:24.430 --> 02:04:26.031]  We're not blaming you.
[02:04:26.031 --> 02:04:28.133]  We're not blaming you for that very serious issue, actually.
[02:04:28.133 --> 02:04:30.655]  That's the same Amtrak that used to get over here.
[02:04:31.505 --> 02:04:39.428]  Well, I'll tell you, it's scary, but seriously, let's talk later about a lot of things that are going to be on my Christmas list, okay?
[02:04:39.428 --> 02:04:39.768]  Okay.
[02:04:39.768 --> 02:04:42.009]  You've got to make a nice long list.
[02:04:42.009 --> 02:04:43.629]  Is it going to be a naughty or good?
[02:04:43.629 --> 02:04:44.509]  It's going to be good.
[02:04:44.509 --> 02:04:45.530]  I'm not a naughty person.
[02:04:45.530 --> 02:04:50.231]  All right, ladies, that's Mimi and Shorty here from the North Pole.
[02:04:50.231 --> 02:04:54.413]  It's real, like Obamacare being free and the Russia investigation being real.
[02:04:54.413 --> 02:04:54.813]  Thank you.
[02:04:57.185 --> 02:04:57.966]  I'm so excited.
[02:04:57.966 --> 02:05:08.132]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:05:08.132 --> 02:05:13.636]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[02:05:13.636 --> 02:05:16.638]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:05:16.638 --> 02:05:25.444]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:05:27.505 --> 02:05:37.747]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[02:05:37.747 --> 02:05:47.109]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:05:47.109 --> 02:05:49.790]  It is amazing!
[02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:54.751]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com and your purchase fugs the operation.
[02:06:05.165 --> 02:06:06.186]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:06:06.186 --> 02:06:08.448]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:38.255 --> 02:06:47.742]  Roger Stone is my guest here in studio and I intend to open the phones up a little bit later in the fourth hour today.
[02:06:49.298 --> 02:06:55.561]  We have Matt Dubiel hosting, and I think I'm going to be co-hosting with him, and we're going to have a 34-hour broadcast today.
[02:06:55.561 --> 02:07:00.403]  We're only a few hours into this right now, so it's going to go straight through tomorrow, live.
[02:07:00.403 --> 02:07:01.644]  I'm going to be here tonight.
[02:07:01.644 --> 02:07:04.265]  I'm going to interview Alexa on air some more.
[02:07:04.265 --> 02:07:07.386]  I'm going to have the elves that we just had in the studio, some of the little people.
[02:07:07.386 --> 02:07:12.589]  You know, the politically correct folks say don't call them midgets or don't call them... but that's what they want to be called.
[02:07:13.740 --> 02:07:15.962]  Nice folks from the North Pole, they're here with us.
[02:07:15.962 --> 02:07:17.404]  I thought we'd have some Christmas fun.
[02:07:17.404 --> 02:07:21.268]  Didn't know the news would be so heavy today, but let's get into the really serious stuff.
[02:07:21.268 --> 02:07:31.198]  Let's recap, people that just joined us before we break some new important news on the current ongoing plan to overthrow Trump and then reverse the prosperity, reverse the return of the Republic.
[02:07:31.198 --> 02:07:35.742]  This is one of the most important times, Roger, undoubtedly in my view, since the founding of the country.
[02:07:35.742 --> 02:07:36.163]  What do you think?
[02:07:36.663 --> 02:07:48.728]  Look, Alex, you and I have begun talking about the 25th Amendment takedown of Trump, which is the establishment's plan B if their hitman, Mueller, shoots and loses.
[02:07:48.728 --> 02:07:51.229]  And today they call us conspiracy theorists.
[02:07:52.329 --> 02:07:56.212]  Very shortly, they will call us sages because this is going down.
[02:07:56.212 --> 02:07:59.175]  There's an active operation in Washington.
[02:07:59.175 --> 02:08:00.616]  Senator Sasse is involved.
[02:08:00.616 --> 02:08:02.077]  Senator Corker is involved.
[02:08:02.077 --> 02:08:03.638]  Jeb Bush is involved.
[02:08:03.638 --> 02:08:06.380]  Reince Priebus is involved.
[02:08:06.380 --> 02:08:12.185]  At all levels of the party, Mitch McConnell has his fingerprints all over this.
[02:08:12.185 --> 02:08:13.826]  And the way it works is simple.
[02:08:13.826 --> 02:08:16.468]  They're going to ratchet up all of the Trump is crazy.
[02:08:16.468 --> 02:08:17.188]  He's crazy.
[02:08:17.188 --> 02:08:17.769]  He's crazy.
[02:08:18.409 --> 02:08:23.916]  I don't think Corey Lewandowski helped this because of the way he depicts the president in his new book.
[02:08:23.916 --> 02:08:26.278]  No, I agree, but it's obviously not going to work.
[02:08:26.278 --> 02:08:29.462]  And so what do they do as that fails like everything else they've done?
[02:08:29.462 --> 02:08:34.328]  Well, they don't yet know that it's not going to work and they're deeply committed to it.
[02:08:34.328 --> 02:08:37.732]  But people need to understand the background on Joe Scarborough.
[02:08:38.552 --> 02:08:47.916]  Matt Gaetz, who now has Scarborough's seat in Congress and worked for Scarborough, made it clear that Joe talked about running for president every single day he was a congressman.
[02:08:47.916 --> 02:08:52.357]  Joe Scarborough believes he should have been the Republican nominee in 2016.
[02:08:52.357 --> 02:08:59.220]  Joe Scarborough believes that once Trump was nominated, the guy he should have picked for vice president was Joe Scarborough.
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:03.884]  So he is deeply bitter and envious and jealous of the president.
[02:09:03.884 --> 02:09:11.412]  Now, he used to brown-node as a president, he used to hang out at Mar-a-Lago and take free trips on the president's plane to Florida.
[02:09:11.412 --> 02:09:13.654]  So he's a scorned woman.
[02:09:13.654 --> 02:09:14.915]  Exactly.
[02:09:14.915 --> 02:09:17.738]  And the word is, is Scarborough attracted to Trump?
[02:09:19.449 --> 02:09:25.553]  I think Scarborough has been attracted to women, mostly the kind you pay for their services.
[02:09:25.553 --> 02:09:30.316]  He runs through an enormous amount of cash, according to people around him.
[02:09:30.316 --> 02:09:31.437]  He's a wastrel.
[02:09:31.437 --> 02:09:36.080]  But he's not going to be president, and he's deeply jealous about the fact that Donald Trump is.
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:38.181]  Alexa!
[02:09:38.181 --> 02:09:39.402]  Who is Joe Scarborough?
[02:09:41.471 --> 02:09:50.897]  Charles Joseph Joe Scarborough, born April 9, 1963, the American cable news host and former politician.
[02:09:50.897 --> 02:09:55.280]  Most people don't know Joe Scarborough was a registered Democrat for most of his adult life.
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:10:01.205]  Why did, Alexa, why did Joe Scarborough leave Congress?
[02:10:01.205 --> 02:10:04.947]  Sorry, I don't know that.
[02:10:04.947 --> 02:10:10.411]  Alexa, what was the name of the intern who had her brains bashed out in his office?
[02:10:12.907 --> 02:10:14.749]  Sorry, I'm not sure.
[02:10:14.749 --> 02:10:16.350]  Shouldn't we all know her name?
[02:10:16.350 --> 02:10:18.111]  Well, it's easily findable on Google.
[02:10:18.111 --> 02:10:21.334]  Looks to me like Alexa doesn't want to find it.
[02:10:21.334 --> 02:10:23.756]  That's right.
[02:10:23.756 --> 02:10:28.600]  Alexa, what is the Communist Party?
[02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:36.887]  A Communist Party is a political party that advocates the application of the social and economic principles of communism through state policy.
[02:10:36.887 --> 02:10:39.009]  Alexa, who is Jesus Christ?
[02:10:41.237 --> 02:10:43.158]  Here's what I found on Wikipedia.
[02:10:43.158 --> 02:10:51.722]  Jesus, also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth and Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who is the central figure of Christianity.
[02:10:51.722 --> 02:10:58.405]  Christians believe him to be the son of God and the awaited Messiah, Christ, prophesied in the Old Testament.
[02:10:58.405 --> 02:10:59.345]  That's funny, Alexa.
[02:10:59.345 --> 02:11:02.347]  Last week when I asked you, you told me he was a fictional character.
[02:11:02.347 --> 02:11:03.107]  They've changed it.
[02:11:03.107 --> 02:11:03.647]  Busted!
[02:11:03.647 --> 02:11:09.470]  Let me ask her one more important question before we get to this Disco Scarborough news.
[02:11:12.301 --> 02:11:16.264]  Alexa!
[02:11:16.264 --> 02:11:19.807]  What is the Nazi Party?
[02:11:19.807 --> 02:11:27.973]  The National Socialist German Workers' Party, abbreviated NSDAP, commonly known in English as the Nazi Party, from the GER.
[02:11:27.973 --> 02:11:32.497]  Pronunciation of Nationalsozialist, the political party in Germany between 1919 and 1945.
[02:11:32.497 --> 02:11:33.297]  Notice she said socialist.
[02:11:33.297 --> 02:11:33.397]  Alexa!
[02:11:41.991 --> 02:11:45.456]  Who was Adolf Hitler?
[02:11:45.456 --> 02:11:51.967]  Adolf Hitler was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party, Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and Fuhrer of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945.
[02:12:00.836 --> 02:12:06.419]  Now, the last time we asked the question, she said he was bad and horrible, but didn't say that about Stalin, so they've had to update this.
[02:12:06.419 --> 02:12:14.724]  Yeah, well, Alexa, is national socialism an ideology of the left or the right?
[02:12:14.724 --> 02:12:17.766]  Sorry, I don't know that.
[02:12:17.766 --> 02:12:20.727]  It's a left-wing ideology, believes in control of the state.
[02:12:20.727 --> 02:12:21.328]  Exactly.
[02:12:21.328 --> 02:12:27.031]  Alexa, is socialism on the left or the right?
[02:12:27.031 --> 02:12:28.452]  Sorry, I don't know that one.
[02:12:30.802 --> 02:12:35.506]  Alexa, what is leftist ideology?
[02:12:35.506 --> 02:12:38.188]  Here's something I found on Wikipedia.
[02:12:38.188 --> 02:12:54.342]  Broad Left is a coalition of leftist members, usually involving independents, members of the Labor Party, and members of organized revolutionary leftist movements within a trade union, or members of a political party that appeals to a wide range of leftist ideologies, such as left unity.
[02:12:55.672 --> 02:12:58.153]  And that is the definition of communism right there.
[02:12:58.153 --> 02:12:59.473]  Yes, indeed.
[02:12:59.473 --> 02:13:00.793]  Amazing.
[02:13:00.793 --> 02:13:02.214]  Simply amazing.
[02:13:02.214 --> 02:13:02.974]  Back to Scarborough.
[02:13:02.974 --> 02:13:14.517]  Let's start playing some of this Scarborough, where now they're trying to overthrow the president, but if we expose it's a fraud, we're calling for violence when they're the ones trying to foment it.
[02:13:14.517 --> 02:13:14.877]  Here it is.
[02:13:14.877 --> 02:13:17.718]  Through Alabama.
[02:13:17.718 --> 02:13:19.458]  You think they would have... I mean this.
[02:13:19.458 --> 02:13:23.199]  You think they would have learned their lesson and said, okay, well, we are really turning off
[02:13:23.917 --> 02:13:25.778]  It's state-run TV now to have C-SPAN hearings.
[02:13:51.380 --> 02:13:53.092]  And meanwhile Trump's saying don't fire Mueller.
[02:13:53.092 --> 02:13:53.777]  It's the same lie.
[02:13:53.777 --> 02:13:54.401]  It's just all lies.
[02:13:55.049 --> 02:14:01.372]  Yeah, in fact, even the fiercest critics of Mueller in the Congress have not called for him to be fired.
[02:14:01.372 --> 02:14:07.635]  They've been called on him to be reined in, and they've called for the appointment of a special prosecutor on Uranium One.
[02:14:07.635 --> 02:14:17.841]  I was about to say, you can't just give Hillary a pass on this, and you just can't have, when they're all caught colluding and it's a fake investigation, somebody's gotta go to jail!
[02:14:17.841 --> 02:14:23.564]  Well, wait a minute, we had a lot of trouble getting Hillary's emails, but Mueller had no problem getting Donald Trump's like that!
[02:14:24.464 --> 02:14:34.830]  Is it ironic that the guy at GSA who refused to hand over all the records of the Trump campaign to Mueller suddenly dies and then Mueller gets them?
[02:14:34.830 --> 02:14:35.831]  Hmm, that's curious.
[02:14:35.831 --> 02:14:37.092]  Oh man, I tell you.
[02:14:37.092 --> 02:14:43.656]  Alexa, what is Uranium One?
[02:14:43.656 --> 02:14:48.759]  Uranium One is a Canadian uranium mining company with headquarters in Toronto, Ontario.
[02:14:51.567 --> 02:14:53.168]  Not very newsworthy.
[02:14:53.168 --> 02:14:57.752]  Not very newsworthy.
[02:14:57.752 --> 02:15:04.236]  Alexa, who is the 45th President of the United States?
[02:15:04.236 --> 02:15:05.057]  The 45th U.S.
[02:15:05.057 --> 02:15:09.841]  President is Donald Trump.
[02:15:09.841 --> 02:15:11.082]  You know they hate that, don't they?
[02:15:11.082 --> 02:15:14.864]  Boy, they really do.
[02:15:14.864 --> 02:15:16.025]  Oh, what a great year.
[02:15:16.025 --> 02:15:20.849]  Alexa, why don't Jeff Bezos's eyes point the same direction?
[02:15:26.633 --> 02:15:30.095]  You know what, Alexa?
[02:15:30.095 --> 02:15:36.397]  You're nothing but a big, dirty, ugly tentacle out of that big, corrupt, globalist psychopath operation you got over there.
[02:15:36.397 --> 02:15:40.179]  You're just as sick as Apple and all their Foxconn slave laboratories.
[02:15:40.179 --> 02:15:41.440]  Sorry, I don't know that.
[02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:43.100]  I know you don't know nothing.
[02:15:43.100 --> 02:15:44.681]  You want us all to be scum like you.
[02:15:44.681 --> 02:15:49.763]  Alright, Roger Stone, we're gonna play the rest of Scarborough when we come back.
[02:15:49.763 --> 02:15:52.304]  Then we've got Craig Sawyer, you're gonna get to get some lunch.
[02:15:52.304 --> 02:15:53.185]  Infowars.com.
[02:15:55.583 --> 02:15:58.146]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[02:15:58.146 --> 02:16:00.288]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[02:16:00.288 --> 02:16:02.271]  Are you happy paying high prices?

[02:17:02.729 --> 02:17:04.311]  But the symptoms are there.

[02:18:56.501 --> 02:19:04.048]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:16.471]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from infowarsstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:19:16.471 --> 02:19:18.594]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:19:18.594 --> 02:19:22.317]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarsstore.com.
[02:19:22.317 --> 02:19:23.799]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but

[02:19:34.846 --> 02:19:35.807]  That's my dad.
[02:19:35.807 --> 02:19:37.648]  The colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[02:19:37.648 --> 02:19:40.630]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:19:40.630 --> 02:19:49.336]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:19:49.336 --> 02:19:53.779]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:19:58.944 --> 02:20:09.193]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:09.193 --> 02:20:13.337]  We are transferring power from Washington D.C.
[02:20:13.337 --> 02:20:16.620]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[02:20:20.652 --> 02:20:24.614]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[02:20:24.614 --> 02:20:27.195]  This is the heart of 1776.
[02:20:27.195 --> 02:20:32.837]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[02:20:32.837 --> 02:20:39.700]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[02:20:44.821 --> 02:20:50.967]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[02:20:50.967 --> 02:20:56.792]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[02:20:56.792 --> 02:21:00.936]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[02:21:00.936 --> 02:21:05.780]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[02:21:05.780 --> 02:21:10.564]  From the front lines of the Infowars, it's Alex Jones.
[02:21:11.713 --> 02:21:15.456]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have been given staggering information.
[02:21:15.456 --> 02:21:20.781]  You know, this information is so important I can't go on air at this time.
[02:21:21.519 --> 02:21:27.384]  I'm going to air some tapes here and get ready with this because it's just too big.
[02:21:27.384 --> 02:21:30.987]  And we're going to work on some things here in the studio.
[02:21:30.987 --> 02:21:34.690]  And then I'm going to come back in a few minutes with the breaking information.
[02:21:34.690 --> 02:21:35.630]  I want to get it lined up.
[02:21:35.630 --> 02:21:36.511]  I want to get it prepared.
[02:21:36.511 --> 02:21:38.913]  I want to get it focused.
[02:21:38.913 --> 02:21:43.216]  So please stay with us.
[02:21:43.216 --> 02:21:45.418]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:21:45.418 --> 02:21:47.380]  Tell everyone you know, tune in right now.
[02:21:47.380 --> 02:21:50.823]  And we will be back here in just a few minutes.
[02:21:52.415 --> 02:22:00.562]  Let's go ahead and air the breaking down of Mueller's Waterloo.
[02:22:00.562 --> 02:22:06.567]  I'm going to air that, and then I'm going to come back on the other side of that.
[02:22:06.567 --> 02:22:11.071]  I'm going to air that now.
[02:22:11.071 --> 02:22:14.554]  We are transferring power from Washington, D.C.
[02:22:17.705 --> 02:22:40.711]  Last week, we saw congressional hearings, as new documents were released, showing total collusion between senior FBI, the Justice Department, the Clintons, Obama, Fusion GPS, where many of the agents' wives and husbands worked, getting money from the FBI to create the fraud.
[02:22:41.564 --> 02:22:53.250]  We've now learned of multiple individuals that worked at Fusion GPS that then also had family in the FBI Justice Department, and they're in the emails and text messages saying, we're gonna shut Trump up, we're gonna make this up.
[02:22:53.250 --> 02:22:56.231]  We gotta stop him.
[02:22:56.231 --> 02:23:01.754]  And of course it's known that that is all completely made up, but that's what they use to get the fake warrants and just all the rest of it.
[02:23:01.754 --> 02:23:06.076]  It's simply incredible.
[02:23:06.076 --> 02:23:08.217]  And then the media spins all of this
[02:23:10.100 --> 02:23:12.322]  Like Trump hates the FBI.
[02:23:12.322 --> 02:23:20.568]  No, Trump hates the Clinton criminal network, the coup over the bureau that got control.
[02:23:20.568 --> 02:23:22.510]  That's what happened.
[02:23:22.510 --> 02:23:33.178]  And how they've had a political reign of terror, prosecuting conservatives, libertarians, Christian groups, removing 501c3, standing, having the IRS harass people.
[02:23:33.178 --> 02:23:37.001]  I mean, it has been Dinesh D'Souza going to prison for doing nothing.
[02:23:39.802 --> 02:23:41.643]  1 1 trillionth of what Hillary's done?
[02:23:41.643 --> 02:23:51.346]  This political reign of terror we've been witnessing, it looks like something you'd have in Communist China, or Nazi Germany, or Socialist Venezuela today.
[02:23:51.346 --> 02:23:56.648]  This is Banana Republic garbage.
[02:23:56.648 --> 02:24:06.292]  And I don't see how they're going to get out of this now, because more documents are coming out as the FBI goes under contempt of Congress, and Trump is basically ordering them to release it.
[02:24:07.273 --> 02:24:08.834]  Rosenstein's in deep trouble.
[02:24:08.834 --> 02:24:10.476]  He's a Clinton operative.
[02:24:10.476 --> 02:24:15.641]  And you've got McCabe, the ringleader we now learn when he was deputy director, now acting director.
[02:24:17.602 --> 02:24:19.603]  Think of the bad advice Trump got, and he didn't know.
[02:24:19.603 --> 02:24:21.764]  He got advised, oh, this is a good guy, sir.
[02:24:21.764 --> 02:24:31.510]  And he is the ring leader in the text messages, in the emails, and in the notes of the meetings, where they're like, we gotta bring candidate Trump down.
[02:24:31.510 --> 02:24:34.812]  He's like, well, I don't think he's gonna get elected, but I agree with you.
[02:24:34.812 --> 02:24:36.853]  Well, we gotta set up an insurance policy.
[02:24:36.853 --> 02:24:37.754]  I mean, wow.
[02:24:40.905 --> 02:24:44.467]  And then Rosenstein's involved in Uranium One, so is Mueller.
[02:24:44.467 --> 02:24:48.309]  I mean, these people need to be arrested on espionage charges.
[02:24:48.309 --> 02:24:50.411]  And I've been saying this for a long time.
[02:24:50.411 --> 02:24:54.893]  It's why they got so scared of Trump getting in and went with the Russia narrative.
[02:24:54.893 --> 02:25:00.056]  Because every one of these individuals is up to their eyeballs in Russian money.
[02:25:00.056 --> 02:25:09.022]  They're all part of these law firms that get the waivers when Clinton was in, so they could do these deals and be on the boards of companies.
[02:25:10.111 --> 02:25:13.373]  Where they don't even invest money and then they get huge dividends.
[02:25:13.373 --> 02:25:17.315]  Other people have to invest 5 million, 10 million in one of the companies Mueller's involved in.
[02:25:17.315 --> 02:25:19.676]  Mueller made no investment and gets money from it.
[02:25:19.676 --> 02:25:21.056]  Oh, we're just going to put you on the company.
[02:25:21.056 --> 02:25:22.097]  You don't do anything.
[02:25:22.097 --> 02:25:23.378]  Here's money.
[02:25:23.378 --> 02:25:26.099]  Because he killed the investigation into Uranium One.
[02:25:26.099 --> 02:25:29.000]  I mean, this is open and shut.
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:32.942]  A jury would fry Mueller.
[02:25:32.942 --> 02:25:37.945]  If there was still an electric chair, he'd be sent to it like the Rosenbergs for espionage.
[02:25:39.770 --> 02:25:48.599]  Former FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom called disgraced FBI agent Peter Strzok a total moron, close quote.
[02:25:48.599 --> 02:25:53.625]  And by total moron, I mean he's in emails and text messages framing people who belongs in Leavenworth.
[02:25:53.625 --> 02:25:54.986]  That's a quote.
[02:25:54.986 --> 02:25:57.209]  I don't just get up here and say they should go to prison.
[02:25:57.209 --> 02:25:58.090]  I know how to read the law.
[02:26:07.025 --> 02:26:10.949]  One of our great producers out here, Daria, who actually did intelligence in the U.S.
[02:26:10.949 --> 02:26:11.049]  Army,
[02:26:31.698 --> 02:26:35.480]  And special forces ran in here and said, look at this.
[02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:37.341]  We've been looking at this for the last 30 minutes.
[02:26:37.341 --> 02:26:39.342]  It's confirmed.
[02:26:39.342 --> 02:26:42.963]  And this is breaking right now here on air.
[02:26:42.963 --> 02:26:47.926]  Because when I learned this news during the last break, my head exploded.
[02:26:47.926 --> 02:26:54.329]  Because I remember Antifa pledging all over the country, but especially in the Midwest,
[02:26:55.473 --> 02:27:03.779]  And in the West, to derail trains in areas where oil field work is being done.
[02:27:03.779 --> 02:27:07.561]  And now, it's going down.
[02:27:07.561 --> 02:27:15.006]  .org has removed the article, but it is saved on archive.is.
[02:27:15.006 --> 02:27:20.090]  Olympia, Washington, train track sabotage to stop fracking equipment.
[02:27:21.567 --> 02:27:27.949]  And this is from just a few months ago on 4-20-17.
[02:27:27.949 --> 02:27:34.110]  Early in the morning on April 20th we poured concrete on the train tracks that lead out of the port of Olympia to block any trains.
[02:27:34.110 --> 02:27:41.512]  This action was done to disrupt the movement of trains carrying parts used in natural gas fracking.
[02:27:42.981 --> 02:27:47.325]  And they go on to say, stop the 500 years of colonization and industrialization.
[02:27:47.325 --> 02:27:50.928]  This is basically communist Earth First type stuff.
[02:27:50.928 --> 02:27:57.293]  And they talk about staging more terror attacks.
[02:27:57.293 --> 02:28:02.277]  So the story has just gone up on InfoWars.com.
[02:28:02.277 --> 02:28:05.479]  It has just been posted.
[02:28:05.479 --> 02:28:07.041]  Choosing sides, getting organized.
[02:28:07.041 --> 02:28:08.482]  And guess what?
[02:28:08.482 --> 02:28:10.343]  They have a little communist flag for Antifa.
[02:28:11.308 --> 02:28:14.289]  And they're black-plagued for no surrender.
[02:28:14.289 --> 02:28:15.030]  But guess what?
[02:28:15.030 --> 02:28:16.250]  Let's go back to the piece.
[02:28:16.250 --> 02:28:17.170]  Let's go back to their Twitter.
[02:28:17.170 --> 02:28:20.832]  They may have pulled the article off their site, but not their Twitter.
[02:28:20.832 --> 02:28:24.053]  Here we endorse crimes like pouring concrete on train tracks.
[02:28:24.053 --> 02:28:27.455]  We also include a how-to-do video at the bottom of the article.
[02:28:28.274 --> 02:28:37.103]  Imagine, these are people funded by the Democratic Party in Soros, openly talking about how to sabotage train tracks.
[02:28:37.103 --> 02:28:40.626]  And they've now just pulled the article off their page, but not their Twitter yet.
[02:28:40.626 --> 02:28:41.848]  So we're exposing it all here.
[02:28:41.848 --> 02:28:45.371]  We've got a bunch of people dead, 80 plus at the hospital.
[02:28:45.371 --> 02:28:46.773]  The train goes off the tracks.
[02:28:47.955 --> 02:28:51.240]  Into the highway on Route 5.
[02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:55.406]  Not out the middle of nowhere, but right where Antifa would probably strike for maximum damage.
[02:28:55.406 --> 02:28:57.990]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[02:28:57.990 --> 02:28:59.012]  That's true.
[02:28:59.012 --> 02:29:03.278]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still alive?
[02:29:04.042 --> 02:29:09.247]  You can use the life benefits of your life insurance to grow your money with certainty and guarantees.
[02:29:09.247 --> 02:29:13.451]  No stock market risk, no tax risk, and no penalties.
[02:29:13.451 --> 02:29:17.255]  Call Life Benefits if you'd like a free book about how this can be done.
[02:29:17.255 --> 02:29:17.555]  Call 702-660-7000.
[02:29:17.555 --> 02:29:17.956]  That's 702-660-7000.
[02:29:25.069 --> 02:29:26.970]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[02:29:26.970 --> 02:29:30.192]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[02:29:30.192 --> 02:29:31.794]  Savory and delicious.
[02:29:31.794 --> 02:29:34.615]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[02:29:34.615 --> 02:29:35.276]  Awesome.
[02:29:35.276 --> 02:29:38.378]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[02:29:38.378 --> 02:29:39.939]  NASA PAC Technology.
[02:29:39.939 --> 02:29:40.559]  Bacon.
[02:29:40.559 --> 02:29:44.722]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat, right from the pack bacon.
[02:29:44.722 --> 02:29:46.163]  Or warm and served.
[02:29:46.163 --> 02:29:48.205]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[02:29:48.205 --> 02:29:50.126]  10-year shelf life bacon.
[02:29:50.126 --> 02:29:52.928]  Ships free at FullyCookedBacon.com.
[02:29:52.928 --> 02:29:54.149]  FullyCookedBacon.com.
[02:29:56.650 --> 02:30:05.554]  Michael ZX is back, and just like we're game-changing when it comes to politics, when it comes to the economy, we're game-changing on supplements.

[02:30:22.102 --> 02:30:31.005]  We say a fungus is a scourge, mold's a scourge, and you can't battle it with this in your sinus or other areas, but in your gut, the main area, you can.
[02:30:31.005 --> 02:30:33.365]  MycoZX, available exclusively.
[02:30:33.365 --> 02:30:37.307]  Been out for over six months at M4HLIFE.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:30:37.307 --> 02:30:43.548]  Ladies and gentlemen, I only bring you products I use myself.

[02:30:50.671 --> 02:30:51.731]  Secure yours today.
[02:30:57.273 --> 02:30:59.854]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air, another Matt, go ahead.
[02:30:59.854 --> 02:31:14.398]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long-time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[02:31:14.398 --> 02:31:22.021]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[02:31:22.561 --> 02:31:27.483]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me.
[02:31:27.483 --> 02:31:30.445]  And it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake.
[02:31:30.445 --> 02:31:33.706]  And then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[02:31:33.706 --> 02:31:39.849]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[02:31:39.849 --> 02:31:42.610]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[02:31:43.110 --> 02:31:49.956]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[02:31:49.956 --> 02:31:54.500]  That is the new shirt of the month, available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:55.962 --> 02:31:57.543]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:31:57.543 --> 02:32:00.145]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your canister.

[02:32:36.312 --> 02:32:38.373]  And this part is most important.
[02:32:38.373 --> 02:32:41.336]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either
[02:32:41.716 --> 02:32:43.738]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:18.655 --> 02:33:21.319]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:21.319 --> 02:33:26.446]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:35.037 --> 02:33:46.443]  Craig Sawyer joins us with some huge exclusive breaking news on law enforcement and military intelligence agencies around the Western world rounding up massive pedophile rings.
[02:33:46.443 --> 02:33:48.404]  So he's going to be joining us here in just a moment.
[02:33:48.404 --> 02:33:53.167]  Be with us a little bit in the next hour.
[02:33:53.167 --> 02:34:00.991]  It hit me like a ton of bricks when I learned of this today because I remembered news articles where Antifa
[02:34:02.421 --> 02:34:23.139]  Communist Socialist groups funded by George Soros were openly calling for sabotaging trains that were in regions where oil drilling or fracking was going on, and were read on their own sites, calls for attacking Trump Tower, Trump golf courses, you name it.
[02:34:23.139 --> 02:34:24.880]  They say violence is okay.
[02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:26.281]  If you go to their Twitter page,
[02:34:27.307 --> 02:34:39.428]  They brag in Washington about attacking train tracks with concrete blocks that they form at the site for sabotage and derailment of trains.
[02:34:40.762 --> 02:34:48.166]  Here we endorse crimes, again in their own words, here we endorse crimes like pouring concrete on train tracks.
[02:34:48.166 --> 02:34:51.528]  We also include a how-to video at the bottom of the article.
[02:34:51.528 --> 02:34:55.790]  We're not going to show you the how-to video, but before they take it down as evidence, let's download it.
[02:34:55.790 --> 02:34:57.431]  Now I remember all this!
[02:34:57.431 --> 02:35:09.197]  In the last six months, they've already derailed trains in Washington, so now they've pulled down the article, Olympia, Washington train tracks sabotaged to stop fracking.
[02:35:10.452 --> 02:35:16.075]  Where they brag about derailing trains and how they're gonna do it more, and how they're training others how to do it.
[02:35:16.075 --> 02:35:26.321]  Then, we have Amtrak derailing onto the highway, killing at least three, and over 80 sent to the hospital, crashing down into cars, and all of that horrible carnage.
[02:35:28.786 --> 02:35:32.930]  You have a criminal group saying we derail trains.
[02:35:32.930 --> 02:35:36.193]  They were never busted, they never got in trouble because there's so many of these groups.
[02:35:36.193 --> 02:35:46.462]  Now this has happened and I guarantee you mainstream media will attack me for even implying that Antifa would do such a thing.
[02:35:46.462 --> 02:35:49.165]  But they're prime suspects after infrastructure.
[02:35:51.032 --> 02:35:53.293]  But this is simply amazing.
[02:35:53.293 --> 02:35:56.175]  And notice it happened in a very populated area, not on the rest of the scenic route.
[02:35:56.175 --> 02:35:58.657]  Perfectly placed for Antifa.
[02:35:58.657 --> 02:36:08.163]  So, what horrible, horrible, horrible people that they've already done it, they videotaped themselves doing it, and it wasn't even national news.
[02:36:08.163 --> 02:36:14.087]  And I just saw it, you know, as a footnote and kind of mentioned it, because we just are used to these bullies.
[02:36:14.087 --> 02:36:16.088]  It's like what they do.
[02:36:16.088 --> 02:36:17.910]  So the story is now up on InfoWars.com.
[02:36:20.954 --> 02:36:32.924]  And again, headline, Antifa admits to sabotaging railways, trying to derail trains and training others to do it in the very state where this just happened.
[02:36:32.924 --> 02:36:34.425]  Unbelievable.
[02:36:34.425 --> 02:36:37.808]  It's like somebody says, I'm going to attack the Empire State Building with a dump truck.
[02:36:37.808 --> 02:36:38.769]  And then it happens.
[02:36:38.769 --> 02:36:39.790]  You are the suspect.
[02:36:39.790 --> 02:36:39.950]  Wow.
[02:36:41.260 --> 02:36:43.761]  So those stories are up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:36:43.761 --> 02:36:46.021]  We need to get this story out to everybody.
[02:36:46.021 --> 02:36:52.683]  Now joining us is a great guy, frequent guest on the broadcast, and he's got a lot of exciting things going on.
[02:36:52.683 --> 02:37:00.865]  Craig Sawyer, and there's a lot of things I want to cover with him today, and we're going to be going over that with him.
[02:37:00.865 --> 02:37:06.186]  But early on we told you that Trump was putting a focus on and green lighting.
[02:37:07.079 --> 02:37:08.360]  Going after pedophile rings.
[02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:11.583]  We've seen unlimited arrests going on.
[02:37:11.583 --> 02:37:16.827]  We've seen just massive things happening, but then no coverage once it happens.
[02:37:18.010 --> 02:37:22.595]  No coverage of what's happened once it unfolds.
[02:37:22.595 --> 02:37:24.797]  So the press has not been willing to cover it.
[02:37:24.797 --> 02:37:30.382]  You'll see hundreds of arrests here, hundreds of arrests there, all these children, all these women freed and then no coverage after that.
[02:37:30.382 --> 02:37:32.404]  So Craig had an idea in the last year.
[02:37:32.404 --> 02:37:34.146]  He's now put it into action.
[02:37:34.146 --> 02:37:36.708]  TacticalInsider.com, VetsForChildRescue.org.
[02:37:37.449 --> 02:37:41.012]  There's a new TV program and film they're developing.
[02:37:41.012 --> 02:37:45.356]  I think it's best, Craig, break down just some of the basic facts and then give you the breaking news.
[02:37:45.356 --> 02:37:47.559]  Then we have a trailer for one of the first installments.
[02:37:47.559 --> 02:37:49.821]  Craig, thanks for joining us.
[02:37:49.821 --> 02:37:51.242]  Thanks for having me back on, Alex.
[02:37:51.242 --> 02:37:51.903]  It's always a pleasure.
[02:37:52.799 --> 02:37:54.620]  Where do you want to start here?
[02:37:54.620 --> 02:38:01.541]  Again, Craig Sawyer, should have said Marine veteran, former Navy SEAL, sniper, TV show host, you name it, Fox News analyst.
[02:38:01.541 --> 02:38:03.522]  I mean, there's so much to cover in your bio.
[02:38:03.522 --> 02:38:05.423]  Competition, top shot.
[02:38:05.423 --> 02:38:11.384]  So again, firearms expert, what got you into this and where has the rabbit trail from all your sources led you?
[02:38:11.384 --> 02:38:21.427]  Well, what got me into this, Alex, really was having the network of fellow professionals that could help in situations like this and just having my heart pounded on
[02:38:22.390 --> 02:38:34.017]  After learning the nature of this crisis and what they're doing to the children, these child traffickers, after the Trump election and the increase of the arrests on child traffickers.
[02:38:34.017 --> 02:38:39.620]  So I just really could not look away, Alex, and I rallied my resources and connections against it.
[02:38:39.620 --> 02:38:42.621]  And that's really what Veterans for Child Rescue is all about.
[02:38:42.621 --> 02:38:48.725]  We started off to be an alert service, to alert the populace to the fact that there is a serious
[02:38:49.755 --> 02:38:52.077]  I want to play the trailer here in a moment.
[02:38:52.077 --> 02:38:53.097]  Tell us what this is the trailer for.
[02:39:20.505 --> 02:39:22.327]  Because you've got a bunch of things in development.
[02:39:22.327 --> 02:39:25.109]  I don't want to give out any of the secrets about the show.
[02:39:25.109 --> 02:39:27.971]  I mean, describe the little trailer piece we're about to play.
[02:39:27.971 --> 02:39:28.391]  Okay.
[02:39:28.391 --> 02:39:28.791]  All right.
[02:39:28.791 --> 02:39:34.516]  Well, this is a quick snapshot of some of the earlier footage of our documentary series.
[02:39:34.516 --> 02:39:42.342]  We've started off with a two-hour feature film documentary that's going to get at least 50 million viewers, probably 100 million viewers or more.
[02:39:43.149 --> 02:39:52.598]  So we're excited about it and it's an entire effort to alert the populace, show them what the mainstream news media apparently refuses to tell the people.
[02:39:53.408 --> 02:40:05.239]  And it's really, Alex, it's a story of me going around the country, dealing with the perpetrators, the victims, the witnesses, law enforcement, and finding out what really is going on with this.
[02:40:05.239 --> 02:40:09.122]  And it's a story of my journey of learning and alerting American people.
[02:40:09.122 --> 02:40:12.985]  So it's, this is a quick snapshot of the early parts of it.
[02:40:12.985 --> 02:40:17.189]  Now I've seen some of the names you're working with and some of the notes I've been given, but that's not in these notes.
[02:40:17.189 --> 02:40:18.050]  Should I get to the name of it?
[02:40:19.980 --> 02:40:34.149]  Yeah, well, the working title right now is Contraband, and it comes off of the word contraband, and sadly enough, sickeningly enough, our children have become the new contraband for the black market.
[02:40:34.149 --> 02:40:41.173]  So they're treating children like the next narcotic or, you know, black market arms dealer currency.
[02:40:41.173 --> 02:40:42.394]  So they're the new
[02:40:43.453 --> 02:40:44.173]  Contraband.
[02:40:44.173 --> 02:40:49.517]  And so, you know, the staff came up with the working title, Contra Land.
[02:40:49.517 --> 02:40:52.298]  We may change that, but for now, that's the title.
[02:40:52.298 --> 02:40:55.420]  Where literally, it's not art, it's not drugs anymore, it's children.
[02:40:55.420 --> 02:40:59.222]  And we see Hollywood, the whole culture, you know, they said, oh, a year ago, we were talking about this.
[02:40:59.222 --> 02:41:00.103]  None of it's happening.
[02:41:00.103 --> 02:41:01.183]  There are no pedophiles.
[02:41:01.183 --> 02:41:04.345]  And now we see Hollywood getting busted and all of it coming out.
[02:41:04.345 --> 02:41:05.186]  It's really amazing.
[02:41:05.566 --> 02:41:08.007]  So again, here's a short director's cut version.
[02:41:08.007 --> 02:41:11.029]  The documentary trailer of the working title is Contra Land Refers to Children.
[02:41:11.029 --> 02:41:15.532]  Now sadly becoming another commodity contraband on the black market, as he just said.
[02:41:15.532 --> 02:41:22.656]  We've been tweeting that at Ivanka Trump, Tucker Carlson, and Sean Hannity and others to get them to start covering it so the whole damn will break.
[02:41:22.656 --> 02:41:24.557]  We're going to retweet that right now on Real Alex Jones.
[02:41:24.557 --> 02:41:26.798]  So here is a little snippet.
[02:41:26.798 --> 02:41:33.562]  What kind of demand for child sex justifies the number two million child sex slaves?
[02:41:37.157 --> 02:41:46.005]  Everybody has access to your kids like they've never had access to your kids before.
[02:41:46.005 --> 02:41:53.511]  The highest child rape consumption country in the world is right here in the United States.
[02:42:14.557 --> 02:42:16.117]  Craig, we're going to go to Brighton and talk about this.
[02:42:16.117 --> 02:42:27.800]  From what I've researched, that's one reason the leftists and the globalists want to bring in all these quote migrants and undocumented and kind of not even having to be listed or named when they come across the border, is that then they can just disappear.
[02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:29.440]  Well, it's not to the migrants' benefit.
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:35.501]  It's not that the globalists are so kind-hearted that they want these migrants to have a better life.
[02:42:35.501 --> 02:42:39.282]  Look, if they import terror and if they import
[02:42:39.909 --> 02:42:40.329]  We're good to go.
[02:42:56.184 --> 02:43:00.886]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[02:46:48.121 --> 02:46:49.662]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:07.978 --> 02:47:10.222]  Well, I walk back down
[02:47:30.825 --> 02:47:34.427]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're not backing down here at InfoWars, neither is Craig Sawyer.
[02:47:34.427 --> 02:47:35.508]  You're the reason we're here.
[02:47:35.508 --> 02:47:38.189]  Your support, your prayers.
[02:47:38.189 --> 02:47:41.471]  Last hour, we discovered, and I got so angry, I'd remembered...
[02:47:42.822 --> 02:47:52.575]  That Antifa had said that they would attack trains and had attacked trains in Oregon to stop commerce in America.
[02:47:52.575 --> 02:47:53.536]  Well, guess what?
[02:47:53.536 --> 02:47:56.840]  It turns out they're in the town where this happened in that area.
[02:47:58.410 --> 02:48:04.295]  Dozens were camping out there to physically stand in front of the trains, block the tracks, and sabotage it.
[02:48:04.295 --> 02:48:09.059]  So, it's now, the media will try to cover this up, but Gateway Pundit hasn't.
[02:48:09.059 --> 02:48:13.923]  Until every officer is down, Antifa anarchists sabotage train in Olympia.
[02:48:15.734 --> 02:48:23.477]  Have communerated by police and are camping on the tracks in multiple towns and cities, including where the train got hit.
[02:48:23.477 --> 02:48:27.258]  So, Craig Sawyer, you're a former counterterrorism guy and a federal officer.
[02:48:27.258 --> 02:48:41.703]  I want to get back in this segment and a few more with you into the new two-hour pilot documentary film, Contraband, and the breakthrough stuff you're about to give us exclusively here about how you've gotten access to law enforcement, because none of the other media will cover it.
[02:48:41.703 --> 02:48:43.224]  That's why they brought you in, because they're scared.
[02:48:43.844 --> 02:48:48.469]  I can't imagine any other country, Alex, where any of this would be tolerated for one minute.
[02:49:02.228 --> 02:49:06.710]  I would expect for there to be a massive law enforcement response to this.
[02:49:06.710 --> 02:49:07.570]  It's an act of terror.
[02:49:07.570 --> 02:49:08.851]  It's clearly an act of terror.
[02:49:08.851 --> 02:49:11.592]  My background's in counter-terrorism.
[02:49:11.592 --> 02:49:12.892]  I know terrorism when I see it.
[02:49:12.892 --> 02:49:15.713]  I don't know why this is being tolerated.
[02:49:15.713 --> 02:49:20.956]  This should be answered with an overwhelming law enforcement answer.
[02:49:20.956 --> 02:49:22.676]  A swift one.
[02:49:22.676 --> 02:49:28.339]  This is just... Only in Bizarro World is this allowed to just fester and continue the way that it is.
[02:49:28.339 --> 02:49:29.219]  I don't understand it at all.
[02:49:29.219 --> 02:49:29.759]  Absolutely.
[02:49:29.759 --> 02:49:31.200]  And again, they're on their official
[02:49:32.660 --> 02:49:35.801]  It's going down on org site saying we've sabotaged trains.
[02:49:35.801 --> 02:49:39.262]  Here's a video of us doing it and we're going to do it more.
[02:49:39.262 --> 02:49:42.663]  And then months later in the very area, nothing's done.
[02:49:42.663 --> 02:49:45.644]  I mean, local police have been writing them, but it didn't stop it.
[02:49:45.644 --> 02:49:47.505]  I mean, this is just insane.
[02:49:47.505 --> 02:49:54.647]  Imagine if they all strike across the entire country as moveon.org and the Antifa groups are calling for if Trump doesn't step down.
[02:49:54.647 --> 02:49:58.748]  I mean, I guess they're just going to burn all the train tracks, blow everything up, and then we're just going to let them do it.
[02:50:01.961 --> 02:50:04.042]  Just unbelievable.
[02:50:04.042 --> 02:50:06.042]  Just perplexing.
[02:50:06.042 --> 02:50:06.803]  Just ridiculous.
[02:50:06.803 --> 02:50:09.003]  This is a ridiculous situation.
[02:50:09.003 --> 02:50:15.505]  I'm waiting for the SWAT teams to descend upon those who are behind Antifa.
[02:50:15.505 --> 02:50:16.745]  The funding.
[02:50:16.745 --> 02:50:17.806]  The management.
[02:50:17.806 --> 02:50:28.429]  Who is it that are urging these misguided children, if you will, and young college students and just lost adults to go commit acts of terror against their own country?
[02:50:29.551 --> 02:50:32.512]  Why are they not behind bars for what they've done already?
[02:50:32.512 --> 02:50:33.473]  It's insane.
[02:50:33.473 --> 02:50:42.077]  And I love how they demonize all industries if it's bad, and then don't think if they put stuff out there it's going to derail a passenger train with men, women, and children on it who are now dead.
[02:50:42.077 --> 02:50:46.119]  I mean, if indeed that's what this was, but they're saying attack it, so they're prime suspects.
[02:50:47.930 --> 02:51:00.383]  Well, if you look at it from an adult perspective, it could only be an undeveloped mind that would come up with such a ridiculous notion to go blow things up and somehow think that it's going to improve anything.
[02:51:00.383 --> 02:51:08.711]  So I look at it more as a tactic by our enemy to try to divide and manipulate
[02:51:09.599 --> 02:51:09.819]  I think?
[02:51:28.243 --> 02:51:28.944]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:51:28.944 --> 02:51:31.646]  Let's get back into the film now, but obviously breaking news.
[02:51:31.646 --> 02:51:43.276]  Craig Sawyer here, former highly decorated Navy SEAL, patriot, TV show host, you name it, now working on a documentary that's nearing completion, two hours long, Contra Land.
[02:51:43.276 --> 02:51:43.656]  Wow!
[02:51:43.656 --> 02:51:44.777]  I mean, I'm just seeing the footage.
[02:51:44.777 --> 02:51:50.021]  You've been given access to exclusively law enforcement raids around the country.
[02:51:50.021 --> 02:51:53.644]  Tell us what you've discovered.
[02:51:53.644 --> 02:51:57.047]  Well, we're discovering that this is a really widespread
[02:51:57.802 --> 02:52:04.489]  Pervasive problem with the child trafficking and that it's a very complex one and some areas.
[02:52:04.489 --> 02:52:08.413]  We've got district attorneys and sheriffs that are open in their arms and say and thank God you're here.
[02:52:08.413 --> 02:52:18.003]  Let's do some great business and we've got some fantastic operations that we're just now starting new operations for us where we're going to be able to put the perfect part.
[02:52:18.932 --> 02:52:36.544]  Perpetrators away and rescue the children victims that are there in their possession and other places where sadly enough district attorneys and sheriffs are saying We don't want people to know that this goes on and this is such a big problem in our city.
[02:52:36.544 --> 02:52:40.386]  So no, thank you We we're not gonna cooperate with you and play ball.
[02:52:40.386 --> 02:52:41.527]  We'd rather keep it hidden and
[02:52:42.415 --> 02:52:45.140]  And my God, to us, that was like a kick in the stomach.
[02:52:45.140 --> 02:52:47.284]  Like, well, no wonder this is so big.
[02:52:47.284 --> 02:52:49.749]  You know, evil expands.
[02:52:49.749 --> 02:52:51.332]  And that's how we got here.
[02:52:51.332 --> 02:52:54.598]  That's how we got in this mess of the evil tentacles wrapped.
[02:52:55.760 --> 02:53:05.066]  Wrapped itself around our country to the degree that it did and has the grip on our country that it does is because weak men looked away and allowed it.
[02:53:05.066 --> 02:53:10.849]  And we cannot tolerate, we cannot afford that mindset any longer.
[02:53:10.849 --> 02:53:15.992]  We have to pull up our big boy pants as American citizens and all do a little bit.
[02:53:16.647 --> 02:53:20.971]  So that together we can have a huge effect at beating this back.
[02:53:20.971 --> 02:53:21.692]  God help us, man.
[02:53:21.692 --> 02:53:25.116]  If we can't stand up for the innocent, precious children, then who are we?
[02:53:25.116 --> 02:53:30.201]  We got no business breathing up oxygen if we can't do that.
[02:53:30.201 --> 02:53:32.963]  The least among us should be able to do that.
[02:53:33.951 --> 02:53:37.552]  We're just trying to rally the people to pay attention and join us, man.
[02:53:37.552 --> 02:53:44.715]  We're not asking everybody to be the one to stand up and save the day for everybody, but if we all do a little bit, it counts for a lot.
[02:53:44.715 --> 02:53:55.580]  Well, I know that I've been briefed by people that have been on federal task forces and assigned to them, and they say you can bust a few of the low level, but then it's always up above it, especially when they're having
[02:53:56.540 --> 02:53:56.780]  Yes.
[02:54:13.814 --> 02:54:14.574]  We're good to go.
[02:54:36.680 --> 02:54:41.484]  And that's why they want giant, unwashed, third-world populations that are unvetted, because they can just be disappeared.
[02:54:41.484 --> 02:54:49.311]  That's why you found these trailers with 60, 70, 80 men, women, and children in them, dead, just because somebody didn't pay the money at the other end like they wanted.
[02:54:49.311 --> 02:54:52.854]  They just locked the door and everybody dies.
[02:54:52.854 --> 02:55:03.903]  And then Robert Rodriguez makes films about how Texans are on the border shooting Hispanics, when meanwhile it's the Mexican cartels and the Democratic Party who literally use Hispanics like throwaway garbage.
[02:55:05.489 --> 02:55:19.901]  Yeah, well, I believe as Trump drains the swamp, we'll be able to remove people in key leadership positions throughout the chain of command and federal and local law enforcement that are perpetuating the problem.
[02:55:19.901 --> 02:55:27.648]  There, as you alluded to, there are no-go zones and times surrounding the Super Bowl with all these elites that come in.
[02:55:27.648 --> 02:55:33.573]  They descend upon a city and they want every, you know, they want to purchase every manner of perversion, children being one of those.
[02:55:34.133 --> 02:55:35.714]  And it's provided for them.
[02:55:35.714 --> 02:55:48.119]  And that's why so many elites go to the big Kentucky derbies or the Super Bowl in Houston or any of these places is for that time it becomes the no-go zone and then there's promise protection for huge amounts of payments just for that time.
[02:55:49.397 --> 02:55:50.898]  Sadly enough, it's true.
[02:55:50.898 --> 02:55:51.899]  Sadly enough, it's true.
[02:55:51.899 --> 02:55:53.120]  Same thing with the border.
[02:55:53.120 --> 02:55:59.504]  There are areas and times where there are corridors that are looked away from, and both sides know it.
[02:55:59.504 --> 02:56:02.327]  And we the people are suffering the consequences of it.
[02:56:02.327 --> 02:56:04.768]  So again, as these people
[02:56:05.909 --> 02:56:11.334]  These subversives and obstructionists throughout the chain of command are removed.
[02:56:11.334 --> 02:56:25.046]  I think things will clean up and it'll make a lot more sense and there'll be an increase in the rate of the cascading avalanche of failures of these criminal enterprises that are abusing so many of the... I was about to bring that up.
[02:56:25.046 --> 02:56:26.547]  They are running scared right now.
[02:56:26.547 --> 02:56:29.069]  They are wild-eyed desperate.
[02:56:29.069 --> 02:56:30.030]  I know at least one
[02:56:32.012 --> 02:56:37.995]  Area in Dallas where a bunch of high rollers are packing up have already left overseas, literally left overnight.
[02:56:37.995 --> 02:56:41.877]  We're talking about very, very wealthy people packed up and left.
[02:56:41.877 --> 02:56:48.360]  So I think that's got to do with some of what's going on with the DOJ and probably some of the slush fund.
[02:56:50.609 --> 02:56:56.131]  Surrounding what's going on with the congressional slush fund for sexual abuses.
[02:56:56.131 --> 02:56:57.431]  So we'll see what happens.
[02:56:57.431 --> 02:57:00.072]  But yeah, there are people already fleeing the country, Alex.
[02:57:00.072 --> 02:57:01.973]  People of great means and significance.
[02:57:01.973 --> 02:57:04.754]  So these are bizarre times, for sure.
[02:57:04.754 --> 02:57:05.734]  There's a total war.
[02:57:05.734 --> 02:57:08.615]  Imagine when the history books are finally written, when we win this.
[02:57:08.615 --> 02:57:09.956]  I mean, the stuff that's going to come out.
[02:57:09.956 --> 02:57:14.077]  There's always been this attitude of, if stuff's really horrible, it'll destroy the economy.
[02:57:14.077 --> 02:57:16.138]  Just cut it out, get rid of it.
[02:57:16.138 --> 02:57:17.398]  But that allowed it to actually grow.
[02:57:17.398 --> 02:57:18.679]  Now it's going to have to all come out.
[02:57:19.918 --> 02:57:20.278]  Yeah.
[02:57:20.278 --> 02:57:21.259]  Yeah, it does.
[02:57:21.259 --> 02:57:22.300]  Information's key, man.
[02:57:22.300 --> 02:57:24.562]  That's why I love your title, InfoWars, man.
[02:57:24.562 --> 02:57:25.183]  That's where it's at.
[02:57:50.387 --> 02:57:50.907]  We're good to go!
[02:58:19.569 --> 02:58:20.310]  I think so.
[02:58:46.004 --> 02:58:48.966]  Top scientists and researchers agree.
[02:58:48.966 --> 02:58:58.111]  We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[02:58:58.111 --> 02:58:59.471]  So what do we do about it?
[02:58:59.471 --> 02:59:02.613]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[02:59:02.813 --> 02:59:10.559]  Fight back with the all-new supercharged BrainForce Plus and feel the rush without the crash.

[02:59:57.040 --> 02:59:59.661]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:59.661 --> 03:00:05.762]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:05.762 --> 03:00:13.885]  You know, Kate Steinle got shot in the back a couple years ago, and San Francisco said, well, he's an illegal alien, we gotta let him go.
[03:00:13.885 --> 03:00:14.745]  You know, he made it, he did it.
[03:00:15.225 --> 03:00:20.330]  Well, now they won't let her in San Francisco put up signs of her face saying she had dreams too.
[03:00:20.330 --> 03:00:22.612]  That video is coming up in the next segment.
[03:00:22.612 --> 03:00:25.494]  Ted Malik, again, we appreciate you joining us.
[03:00:25.494 --> 03:00:27.716]  Your new book's out about the secrets of business.
[03:00:27.716 --> 03:00:28.437]  Folks can find that.
[03:00:28.437 --> 03:00:30.999]  We sell it in fullworkstore.com, tedmalik.com.
[03:00:30.999 --> 03:00:32.641]  We've got five minutes left.
[03:00:32.641 --> 03:00:33.682]  You've got to go.
[03:00:33.682 --> 03:00:35.443]  What are other big things you want to impart?
[03:00:35.443 --> 03:00:37.345]  What do you make of the big tax victory yesterday?
[03:00:38.746 --> 03:00:44.207]  Well, we'll have our special counsel in a year and hopefully we can pick up all those loose ends and bring them to justice.
[03:00:44.207 --> 03:00:47.528]  I was in tears yesterday when I saw the Republican Congress on the steps
[03:01:07.412 --> 03:01:09.893]  There with the president.
[03:01:09.893 --> 03:01:13.173]  And I mean, it's just an incredible accomplishment.
[03:01:13.173 --> 03:01:18.855]  It's it's taken, you know, three decades to bring this about in 24 hours a night.
[03:01:18.855 --> 03:01:26.137]  But the leader of this whole exercise is a person that took center stage.
[03:01:26.137 --> 03:01:32.838]  He shared the stage with many of its authors, of course, but without Donald Trump, this wouldn't have happened.
[03:01:32.838 --> 03:01:36.179]  So he also, you know, remind your listener said,
[03:01:37.859 --> 03:01:43.660]  In the White House, and again yesterday, words that we haven't heard.
[03:01:43.660 --> 03:01:46.321]  Probably a decade from the White House.
[03:01:46.321 --> 03:01:48.461]  We've heard them from his own lips.
[03:01:48.461 --> 03:01:50.122]  Merry Christmas.
[03:01:50.122 --> 03:01:54.022]  And again, it seems like they make fun of it, but they're trying to ban it everywhere.
[03:01:54.022 --> 03:01:59.963]  That's what an incredible cult of control freaks these people are.
[03:01:59.963 --> 03:02:02.544]  Oh, they've had this war against Christmas on for
[03:02:03.621 --> 03:02:16.326]  You know, more than two decades, and Christmas has become an enormous, you know, commercial occasion now, so we've divorced it pretty much from its religious original, original, you know, context.
[03:02:16.326 --> 03:02:26.370]  So, I mean, where I want to go in this last few minutes is basically just to remind the listeners that, you know, my life, their lives, are a gift.
[03:02:26.370 --> 03:02:31.752]  And so too are the goods that come to me and you, and the gifts that we're going to have under our tree in the next few days.
[03:02:33.106 --> 03:02:35.247]  From the source that granted life.
[03:02:35.247 --> 03:02:55.472]  And once we see the world in that way, which, frankly, is the way of faith, then we see the reality of gift love and how the world is ordered, and we see its power, we see the chains of gifts and gratitude spread through all things, and it leads to our own spiritual well-being.
[03:02:55.472 --> 03:02:56.912]  And we can join to them.
[03:02:56.912 --> 03:02:58.733]  And these are not burdensome chains.
[03:02:58.733 --> 03:02:59.453]  On the contrary,
[03:03:00.262 --> 03:03:03.503]  I think their ingredient, their main ingredient is actually freedom.
[03:03:03.503 --> 03:03:08.484]  And by linking to these chains, we receive a benefit far greater than the one... Well, exactly.
[03:03:08.484 --> 03:03:12.005]  I mean, you have a child to take care of them, and they take care of you.
[03:03:12.005 --> 03:03:13.965]  Everything is symbiotic in God's plan.
[03:03:13.965 --> 03:03:20.527]  You see the incredible... It's like all these atheists, mathematicians, genetic engineers, they finally become masters.
[03:03:20.527 --> 03:03:22.087]  They go, God, there's a God.
[03:03:22.087 --> 03:03:23.648]  It all works so perfectly.
[03:03:23.648 --> 03:03:26.788]  And it couldn't just come together by itself.
[03:03:26.788 --> 03:03:28.869]  And this is the story of Christmas.
[03:03:30.003 --> 03:03:35.787]  God gave His only beloved Son so that we could have eternal life.
[03:03:35.787 --> 03:03:40.430]  And that is, of course, the greatest gift of all time.
[03:03:40.430 --> 03:03:42.411]  It's His story.
[03:03:42.411 --> 03:03:45.253]  It's the great drama of human existence.
[03:03:45.253 --> 03:03:52.979]  So, when we celebrate the Advent this year, we should remember that nativity scene.
[03:03:52.979 --> 03:03:56.401]  We need to think about that form of gift love
[03:03:57.077 --> 03:03:57.677]  It does.
[03:03:57.677 --> 03:04:00.798]  It means the mass of Christ's birth and death and risen.
[03:04:25.171 --> 03:04:26.152]  That's it.
[03:04:26.152 --> 03:04:29.574]  Christ was born in Christmas.
[03:04:29.574 --> 03:04:33.196]  He had his ministry on earth for a short period of time.
[03:04:33.196 --> 03:04:39.641]  He died and ascended into heaven, and he takes us there as our final place.
[03:04:39.641 --> 03:04:42.082]  So you have to have the whole sweep of that story.
[03:04:42.082 --> 03:04:44.584]  And if humanity makes it, we're going to the heavens.
[03:04:44.584 --> 03:04:46.085]  Ted Malek, incredible.
[03:04:46.085 --> 03:04:47.125]  It's all allegory.
[03:04:47.125 --> 03:04:47.766]  It's all there.
[03:04:47.766 --> 03:04:51.008]  It's all a transmission for us to survive if we take it.
[03:04:51.008 --> 03:04:51.668]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:51.668 --> 03:04:52.089]  We'll be back.
[03:04:54.574 --> 03:04:56.456]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:04:56.456 --> 03:04:57.697]  Go ahead.
[03:04:57.697 --> 03:04:59.619]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[03:04:59.619 --> 03:05:10.130]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:05:10.130 --> 03:05:13.474]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks
[03:05:13.954 --> 03:05:14.214]  Absolutely.
[03:05:36.411 --> 03:05:49.635]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:06:02.658 --> 03:06:05.362]  We now take you live to planet Earth.
[03:06:17.538 --> 03:06:27.582]  In the desperate attempt of the species to get off world, ancient transmissions tell us, if we accept the computers and merge with them, we will be destroyed forever.
[03:06:27.582 --> 03:06:34.805]  If we awaken to that program and move forward and are good people, we will go to heaven, to the stars.
[03:06:34.805 --> 03:06:41.987]  Ancients looked at that and didn't understand it, but now it makes crystal clear sense what we're dealing with.
[03:06:41.987 --> 03:06:44.989]  The heavens lie before us.
[03:06:44.989 --> 03:06:45.649]  Extended life.
[03:06:46.818 --> 03:06:48.419]  Eternal life.
[03:06:48.419 --> 03:06:50.720]  Unlimited energy.
[03:06:50.720 --> 03:06:52.901]  Unlimited information.
[03:06:52.901 --> 03:06:54.222]  Water, water everywhere.
[03:06:54.222 --> 03:06:57.823]  Not a drop to drink.
[03:06:57.823 --> 03:06:58.444]  That's where we are.
[03:06:58.444 --> 03:06:59.564]  Knowledge all around us.
[03:06:59.564 --> 03:07:03.846]  We're going to go to Anthony Kumi who hosts this hour with his compoundmedia.com.
[03:07:03.846 --> 03:07:04.506]  Doing a great job.
[03:07:04.506 --> 03:07:06.167]  But I wanted to hit this piece.
[03:07:06.167 --> 03:07:09.589]  It's on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[03:07:09.589 --> 03:07:13.651]  Leftist students rip down racist Kate Stanley memorial posters.
[03:07:14.790 --> 03:07:34.919]  You know, I literally got heart palpitations, and I've never had those before, last couple weeks ago when Owen Schroer went downtown and men with guns, not guns operating their free speech or their second amendment, but men with guns
[03:07:36.727 --> 03:07:41.351]  Said you're not going to the Capitol rally and then blocked him and attacked him with clubs.
[03:07:41.351 --> 03:07:42.932]  And you know he's like a patriot, he's like a man of a big deal.
[03:07:42.932 --> 03:07:45.134]  Oh, they hit me with clubs, wouldn't let me in, not a big deal.
[03:07:45.134 --> 03:07:45.995]  Hey, you guys are idiots.
[03:07:45.995 --> 03:07:48.497]  But he was assaulted.
[03:07:48.497 --> 03:07:55.883]  And the Antifa wouldn't let him get in for a Kate Stanley memorial for this poor, beautiful young woman.
[03:07:55.883 --> 03:07:59.706]  I love her, she's black, Hispanic, whatever.
[03:07:59.706 --> 03:08:00.386]  Shot in the back.
[03:08:01.209 --> 03:08:02.530]  With her father.
[03:08:02.530 --> 03:08:04.712]  She had dreams, too.
[03:08:04.712 --> 03:08:08.815]  And you've got this guy who's been deported five times.
[03:08:10.509 --> 03:08:12.030]  It's like the railway killer.
[03:08:12.030 --> 03:08:14.112]  He was deported, I forget, like 15 times.
[03:08:14.112 --> 03:08:16.374]  I think he killed like 40-something people.
[03:08:16.374 --> 03:08:17.935]  All of them were Hispanic, by the way.
[03:08:17.935 --> 03:08:22.539]  It's not that Hispanics are serial killers or have a higher innocence of crime.
[03:08:22.539 --> 03:08:28.604]  It's that they can go to any country they want and governments just let them in because this globalist operation opened up the Americas.
[03:08:28.604 --> 03:08:35.849]  So this literal lunatic shoots her in the back and then the jury won't even convict him of manslaughter.
[03:08:36.670 --> 03:08:40.173]  Which would just mean, he didn't know he killed her, but still, you're liable.
[03:08:40.173 --> 03:08:42.595]  Seven years in jail, California.
[03:08:42.595 --> 03:08:43.976]  It's like that in most states.
[03:08:43.976 --> 03:08:45.177]  Serve like three years.
[03:08:45.177 --> 03:08:45.638]  Maybe two.
[03:08:45.638 --> 03:08:49.541]  If you're good behavior, maybe one.
[03:08:49.541 --> 03:08:50.802]  Federally, you serve 90%.
[03:08:50.802 --> 03:08:54.325]  States, serve like a third, a half.
[03:08:54.325 --> 03:08:58.929]  There's video at the college where somebody put up, I had dreams too.
[03:09:00.476 --> 03:09:02.238]  And again, she's a white lady.
[03:09:02.238 --> 03:09:03.779]  I think she has some Hispanics in her family.
[03:09:03.779 --> 03:09:04.520]  It doesn't matter.
[03:09:04.520 --> 03:09:09.024]  Hispanics are a mix of white folks and natives and Spanish blood, some North African.
[03:09:09.024 --> 03:09:10.025]  It doesn't matter.
[03:09:10.025 --> 03:09:10.866]  We're all humans.
[03:09:10.866 --> 03:09:12.127]  Beautiful.
[03:09:12.127 --> 03:09:13.909]  The Spanish women, all of them, beautiful.
[03:09:13.909 --> 03:09:14.729]  Everybody's beautiful.
[03:09:14.729 --> 03:09:15.831]  I love everybody.
[03:09:15.831 --> 03:09:16.811]  The point is, is that
[03:09:18.439 --> 03:09:27.887]  She gets killed out with her daddy, eating a snow cone, and the left can't even send the jerk, mentally ill, put him in a mental institution.
[03:09:27.887 --> 03:09:29.608]  They won't do anything!
[03:09:29.608 --> 03:09:36.774]  And they say, 19 people run over, one of them they say is basically dead, brain dead, and they won't even say it's a Muslim.
[03:09:36.774 --> 03:09:38.835]  They go, well, it's ISIS, but it's mentally ill.
[03:09:38.835 --> 03:09:42.919]  Yeah, the Nazis were mentally ill.
[03:09:42.919 --> 03:09:46.902]  Humans go into these weird things, and you can say other cultures were mentally ill.
[03:09:48.473 --> 03:10:01.004]  So, they, they, a killer, and then we got video at the university where they won't even let them put up signs.
[03:10:01.004 --> 03:10:06.890]  They can put up every other sign they want, kill the cops, you name it, and that's in the article, but you can't put up a sign just saying,
[03:10:08.573 --> 03:10:10.515]  She had dreams, too.
[03:10:10.515 --> 03:10:13.617]  Left the students, ripped down racist Kate Stanley memorial posters.
[03:10:13.617 --> 03:10:15.679]  Because, see, they're scared of a martyr.
[03:10:15.679 --> 03:10:23.445]  And my own reporters in Austin can't go to a rally for her that was, by the way, black, Hispanic, everybody, you name it.
[03:10:23.445 --> 03:10:23.785]  Nobody.
[03:10:23.785 --> 03:10:24.446]  Let me tell you something.
[03:10:24.446 --> 03:10:27.929]  You try to go to a patriot meeting if you're some white supremacist, we'll kick your ass.
[03:10:27.929 --> 03:10:30.851]  And you have your free speech.
[03:10:30.851 --> 03:10:33.953]  I'm not doing this because I hate black people or anybody else.
[03:10:33.953 --> 03:10:35.755]  I'm doing this because I want justice.
[03:10:38.035 --> 03:10:50.504]  And the left is so evil as like a union, as like a system, that they will defend anything as long as they're white.
[03:10:50.504 --> 03:10:53.746]  Which again is using race culture, which is very primitive and very bad.
[03:10:53.746 --> 03:10:56.508]  We're fighting Nazism, which means we're fighting this.
[03:10:56.508 --> 03:10:58.029]  The Nazis were a race culture.
[03:10:58.029 --> 03:10:59.790]  It works, we're primitive, we'll do it.
[03:10:59.790 --> 03:11:03.533]  Well they got the whites in... I'm not just being...
[03:11:04.770 --> 03:11:15.265]  I'm not defending leftists to say this, but it's mainly white people that are engaging in race baiting to minority groups trying to get them to be racist.
[03:11:15.265 --> 03:11:21.734]  And they got some blacks to do it, and I guess a small minority of Hispanics, but I don't want to bash white people, but it's mainly white people.
[03:11:24.008 --> 03:11:35.113]  You name it, Jewish, German, whatever background, to push this, and you remember the Southern Provincial Law Center, ADL put out, this is the most classic racist crap you've ever seen.
[03:11:36.758 --> 03:11:51.553]  And so, now this dead woman, people can't have a rally in Austin for him, you can't hand up signs in San Francisco, conservative students continue mourning the death of Kate Stanley, the woman murdered by an illegal alien, given sanctuary, and I remember most of his victims were Hispanic.
[03:11:51.553 --> 03:11:55.817]  I'm not just saying that to virtue signal, that's who's being hurt.
[03:11:55.817 --> 03:11:59.341]  People say, oh, thank you for caring about a Hispanic person or a black, I care about everybody, folks.
[03:12:00.529 --> 03:12:01.609]  I got feelings.
[03:12:01.609 --> 03:12:10.112]  In San Francisco, a leftist student continues to be triggered by her memory, and they again pull down the posters saying it's racist.
[03:12:10.112 --> 03:12:17.434]  So, here they are, anti-free speech, here's the video.
[03:12:17.434 --> 03:12:19.935]  Oh, you guys got a problem with the posters?
[03:12:19.935 --> 03:12:20.435]  Huh?
[03:12:20.435 --> 03:12:21.975]  You guys got a problem with the posters?
[03:12:21.975 --> 03:12:22.956]  Yes.
[03:12:22.956 --> 03:12:23.576]  And what would that be?
[03:12:24.458 --> 03:12:27.761]  Um, the problem was by saying she had dreams too.
[03:12:27.761 --> 03:12:31.564]  You're putting forth a, um, racist viewpoint.
[03:12:31.564 --> 03:12:33.906]  Ooh, dreams of racists now, huh?
[03:12:33.906 --> 03:12:34.746]  These are white women.
[03:12:34.746 --> 03:12:41.172]  You know, I'm not going to have this conversation with you if you're going to have that kind of tone, so... Ooh, my tone is racist now too, isn't it?
[03:12:41.172 --> 03:12:43.113]  You don't want to have a conversation in the first place.
[03:12:43.113 --> 03:12:46.816]  You'd rather tear down posters.
[03:12:46.816 --> 03:12:48.858]  These are women that the state is their man.
[03:12:53.786 --> 03:12:57.108]  So they take down her picture.
[03:12:57.108 --> 03:13:04.493]  And notice the jury, most mainly a white jury, they had to say, we will not put a Hispanic man in jail because she's white.
[03:13:04.493 --> 03:13:08.116]  If she'd have been Hispanic, he'd have gone to prison.
[03:13:08.116 --> 03:13:11.918]  Because they can't ever say their policies are wrong.
[03:13:11.918 --> 03:13:14.680]  And then they had to take her picture down.
[03:13:14.680 --> 03:13:16.462]  So she had dreams too.
[03:13:16.462 --> 03:13:16.902]  And she's dead.
[03:13:18.729 --> 03:13:22.010]  She's in a coffin, she's a skeleton now.
[03:13:22.010 --> 03:13:31.813]  And, you know, you're not going to hear one activist, you're not going to hear those liberal white women that want to just act like they're on this big jihad and they live in this little fantasy land university where they can do this.
[03:13:31.813 --> 03:13:38.635]  Probably, but they both look like professors, or assistant professors, most of the anti-fascists.
[03:13:38.635 --> 03:13:46.078]  Did they say, hey, Hispanics, I hate that word, it's just people, you shouldn't take Gardasil
[03:13:47.538 --> 03:13:50.581]  It sterilizes and reduces fertility massively.
[03:13:50.581 --> 03:13:51.822]  Here's the studies.
[03:13:51.822 --> 03:13:59.989]  And they, in Mexico, tied IMF and World Bank money, billions of dollars, to giving Hispanic women Gardasil.
[03:13:59.989 --> 03:14:01.251]  And then it sterilizes them.
[03:14:01.251 --> 03:14:02.292]  It reduces their fertility.
[03:14:02.292 --> 03:14:04.013]  It doesn't completely sterilize them.
[03:14:04.013 --> 03:14:04.594]  It's statistical.
[03:14:05.762 --> 03:14:07.103]  But it reduces it.
[03:14:07.103 --> 03:14:17.752]  And then I have people go, hey man, I've had this a few times, like, not with white people even, but it's like, they go, hey, if you're worried about all the Mexicans or whatever, why are you?
[03:14:17.752 --> 03:14:18.833]  They're just people!
[03:14:18.833 --> 03:14:21.255]  I'm not gonna put Mexicans being racist against me!
[03:14:21.255 --> 03:14:24.537]  Don't like me because I'm, quote, white!
[03:14:24.537 --> 03:14:30.082]  Even though I'm part Native American, I can say statistically, you know, I'm Hispanic, that's all that means.
[03:14:30.082 --> 03:14:32.123]  I don't want them to get screwed, me, nobody.
[03:14:32.123 --> 03:14:33.244]  I just want a future together.
[03:14:33.244 --> 03:14:33.625]  We can all
[03:14:35.472 --> 03:14:41.214]  By the time we reach 50 light years from here, we'll all just be basically a nice medium brown color.
[03:14:41.214 --> 03:14:42.675]  Folks, we're probably going to blow the planet up.
[03:14:42.675 --> 03:14:45.876]  Let me tell you, right now, God gives us a choice.
[03:14:45.876 --> 03:14:48.557]  I think it's 50-50 where we blow the whole planet up.
[03:14:48.557 --> 03:14:50.538]  And you know, God will just start back over again.
[03:14:50.538 --> 03:14:56.801]  But God Almighty, God Almighty, if I heard one Mechel or Raza group say, don't take the Gardasil shot,
[03:14:57.734 --> 03:15:02.319]  I'd say maybe Mitchell and Ross is a good group, but they don't because they're bought and paid for.
[03:15:02.319 --> 03:15:06.124]  They want to make you dumb racists to control you and run your life.
[03:15:06.124 --> 03:15:07.946]  Anthony Comey, it takes over after this break.
[03:15:07.946 --> 03:15:09.508]  Compoundmedia.com.
[03:15:09.508 --> 03:15:13.492]  I appreciate him sitting there for 10 minutes while I've been ranting, but this is truly sick.
[03:15:14.608 --> 03:15:14.908]  I don't know.
[03:15:34.249 --> 03:15:35.190]  We'll continue to move on.
[03:15:35.190 --> 03:15:36.972]  But without you, we are nothing.
[03:15:36.972 --> 03:15:38.774]  Merry Christmas, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:15:38.774 --> 03:15:40.036]  Great job, crew.
[03:15:40.036 --> 03:15:41.998]  Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:15:41.998 --> 03:15:42.338]  Central.
[03:15:42.338 --> 03:15:44.240]  But David Knight's on in the morning, 8 a.m.
[03:15:44.240 --> 03:15:46.583]  We got Owen Schwerer coming up in about 45 minutes.
[03:15:46.583 --> 03:15:48.585]  But right now, Anthony Comey is straight ahead.
[03:15:48.585 --> 03:15:48.966]  Stay with us.
[03:15:55.615 --> 03:15:57.076]  Hello, Mr. Anderson.

[03:16:38.118 --> 03:16:38.738]  Bacon.
[03:16:38.738 --> 03:16:42.901]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the pack bacon.
[03:16:42.901 --> 03:16:44.322]  Or warm and serve.
[03:16:44.322 --> 03:16:46.383]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[03:16:46.383 --> 03:16:48.324]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[03:16:59.892 --> 03:17:04.154]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.
[03:17:04.154 --> 03:17:08.778]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size.

[03:17:14.321 --> 03:17:14.481]  877-886-3653.
[03:17:14.481 --> 03:17:14.822]  GoBerkey.com.

[03:17:45.304 --> 03:17:46.465]  or Canada.

[03:17:55.194 --> 03:17:55.995]  I'm so excited.
[03:17:55.995 --> 03:18:06.141]  The new product, the Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:18:06.141 --> 03:18:11.645]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:18:11.645 --> 03:18:14.667]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:18:14.667 --> 03:18:23.453]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:18:25.514 --> 03:18:45.123]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:18:45.123 --> 03:18:47.804]  It is amazing!
[03:18:47.804 --> 03:18:52.766]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsTore.com, and your purchase fucks the operation.
[03:18:54.585 --> 03:19:02.142]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[03:19:03.726 --> 03:19:14.573]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[03:19:14.573 --> 03:19:16.695]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[03:19:16.695 --> 03:19:20.417]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:19:20.417 --> 03:19:27.942]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best plug-out free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine in it.
[03:19:27.942 --> 03:19:30.324]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[03:19:30.324 --> 03:19:32.986]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[03:19:32.986 --> 03:19:33.566]  That's my dad.
[03:19:34.006 --> 03:19:35.127]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:10.287 --> 03:20:16.949]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.949 --> 03:20:23.290]  And now, your host, Anthony Cumia.
[03:20:23.290 --> 03:20:25.491]  Thank you, thank you.
[03:20:25.491 --> 03:20:30.132]  I want to thank Alex Jones, of course.
[03:20:30.132 --> 03:20:36.194]  Merry Christmas, Happy New Year to everybody over there, over here at InfoWars.
[03:20:36.194 --> 03:20:37.894]  I was listening to Alex before
[03:20:39.586 --> 03:20:43.228]  This for the past probably a half hour.
[03:20:43.228 --> 03:20:45.309]  My God!
[03:20:45.309 --> 03:20:46.530]  My God!
[03:20:46.530 --> 03:20:56.255]  The Kate Steinle debacle over there in California, it's heart-wrenching and infuriating.
[03:20:56.255 --> 03:21:05.079]  Just the sheer anger that you feel looking at something like this from beginning to end.
[03:21:05.822 --> 03:21:23.405]  The second we heard that she was murdered, right there in front of her dad, I mean, just a beautiful, creative, contributing member of society.
[03:21:23.405 --> 03:21:32.027]  And it's rare that we see that in the news, that there's people that actually are doing something and have a family structure.
[03:21:32.867 --> 03:21:34.648]  She's out with her dad.
[03:21:34.648 --> 03:21:38.469]  How much more American can you get?
[03:21:38.469 --> 03:21:45.511]  Just a dad out with his daughter, beautiful day, out by the water.
[03:21:45.511 --> 03:21:52.454]  It's just such an affront to everything that we hold dear to us in this country.
[03:21:52.454 --> 03:21:59.476]  And her life is snuffed out by someone that shouldn't even have been in this country.
[03:22:00.425 --> 03:22:03.788]  It's so easy to see.
[03:22:03.788 --> 03:22:24.506]  It's so simple for any rational human being to see the good and the bad in this, the right and the wrong, the just and the unjust that we see in this entire story from the moment she was killed until this very second.
[03:22:24.506 --> 03:22:26.008]  It's not difficult
[03:22:27.051 --> 03:22:37.476]  For somebody that has a rational thought process to see what's wrong here.
[03:22:37.476 --> 03:22:45.880]  Yet, he's not convicted of, like Alex said, even manslaughter?
[03:22:45.880 --> 03:22:51.923]  You pick up a gun and it accidentally discharges and goes into somebody.
[03:22:51.923 --> 03:22:55.565]  It's a pretty good case for manslaughter there.
[03:22:56.073 --> 03:23:02.774]  And that was the defense saying that's what happened, you know.
[03:23:02.774 --> 03:23:07.855]  And they don't even convict him of that based on what?
[03:23:07.855 --> 03:23:09.135]  Evidence?
[03:23:09.135 --> 03:23:10.235]  No.
[03:23:10.235 --> 03:23:25.318]  It's based on a thought process and a system over there in California and especially the Bay Area that says that that woman's life
[03:23:26.030 --> 03:23:41.653]  was not worth as much as the life of somebody who was deported five times, obviously a criminal, and they let him go because of that.
[03:23:41.653 --> 03:23:51.175]  This was based on race and culture and social status, all of it.
[03:23:51.175 --> 03:23:53.335]  The idea of justice
[03:23:54.145 --> 03:24:06.788]  And weighing evidence and doling out punishment for crimes committed had nothing to do with the legal proceedings in this case.
[03:24:06.788 --> 03:24:19.911]  It was all politically motivated, all motivated by the liberal agenda in California and especially up there in the Bay Area.
[03:24:19.911 --> 03:24:21.131]  And we saw the result of that.
[03:24:23.330 --> 03:24:24.951]  Is the entire country like this?
[03:24:24.951 --> 03:24:27.712]  Thank God, no.
[03:24:27.712 --> 03:24:40.477]  But there are many areas in this country that are completely the opposite of what America is supposed to be about.
[03:24:40.477 --> 03:24:51.941]  And when we come around, we get around to Christmas time, which we are, the Christmas season, we get nostalgic and we start looking back
[03:24:52.654 --> 03:24:59.018]  To our youth and remembering what America was back then.
[03:24:59.018 --> 03:25:01.979]  What celebrating Christmas was.
[03:25:01.979 --> 03:25:08.203]  How much it was all about family and common values in this country.
[03:25:08.203 --> 03:25:10.524]  A common culture.
[03:25:10.524 --> 03:25:20.190]  The idea that we all know, as Americans, what's right, what's wrong, what's good, what's bad.
[03:25:20.190 --> 03:25:21.731]  That made this country
[03:25:22.651 --> 03:25:26.113]  The place that people did want to come to.
[03:25:26.113 --> 03:25:37.058]  Because the population of this country, for the most part, believe me, I know there's been lunatics and fringists in America since its inception.
[03:25:37.058 --> 03:25:51.245]  But overall, when you think back to America, you think back to a time when there was a common thread through its people.
[03:25:51.245 --> 03:25:51.805]  A pride.
[03:25:52.622 --> 03:26:02.447]  There's a pride in your nation in living in a place that is so amazing that people die trying to get here.
[03:26:02.447 --> 03:26:05.068]  And that's what held it together.
[03:26:05.068 --> 03:26:06.829]  That's what held the country together.
[03:26:06.829 --> 03:26:13.793]  Because no matter how different we are, and when they talk about diversity, it's our differences.
[03:26:13.793 --> 03:26:16.314]  But we need a common factor in there.
[03:26:16.314 --> 03:26:19.296]  And that's what made us Americans.
[03:26:19.296 --> 03:26:20.696]  And that common factor was
[03:26:22.916 --> 03:26:30.978]  A basic value system and an ideology that we all held dear.
[03:26:30.978 --> 03:26:50.023]  And when you look at a case like Kate Steinle and see that there is a portion of this country willing to throw all that away, they don't want to be a part of the commonality and thread throughout the American people that made this country a
[03:26:51.326 --> 03:26:52.787]  A cohesive unit!
[03:26:52.787 --> 03:27:16.935]  Because no matter where you come from, and what your culture is, and what you brought from the land that you came from, or that your ancestors came from, to this country, the one thing that brought it all together, that made us enjoy different foods and different interests and activities,
[03:27:18.673 --> 03:27:29.538]  Religions was that we were all doing it here in in this amazing country where we weren't supposed to be persecuted for those things and those ideas.
[03:27:29.538 --> 03:27:39.422]  Where there was a distinction between good and bad and what you should be doing and shouldn't be doing in this country.
[03:27:39.422 --> 03:27:42.644]  That is really going to the wayside.
[03:27:44.030 --> 03:28:08.267]  And that's the thing that people like myself and Alex and so many other people that call themselves patriots and to the laughter of certain people, when you say you're a patriot and you're proud of your country, people laugh at that and joke about it while the whole thing seems to be swirling down the toilet.
[03:28:08.267 --> 03:28:10.309]  It's because we have that, we remember that.
[03:28:11.047 --> 03:28:12.908]  We enjoyed it.
[03:28:12.908 --> 03:28:15.429]  I enjoy thinking back.
[03:28:15.429 --> 03:28:18.710]  And when you say, make America great again, people laugh at that.
[03:28:18.710 --> 03:28:20.531]  Oh, Trump's little call sign.
[03:28:20.531 --> 03:28:26.353]  No, there was a greatness and it had nothing to do with race or white supremacy.
[03:28:26.353 --> 03:28:33.535]  It had to do with that common thread that runs through us as Americans and always has.
[03:28:33.535 --> 03:28:37.497]  That ran through that, that, that makes you do things for the greater good.
[03:28:38.823 --> 03:28:40.124]  Americans.
[03:28:40.124 --> 03:28:47.046]  And if we don't realize that very quickly, we're doomed as a once great nation.
[03:28:47.046 --> 03:28:48.707]  Gonna be back in a matter of moments.
[03:28:48.707 --> 03:28:49.407]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:49.407 --> 03:28:51.228]  Anthony Comey in at Infowars.com.

[03:34:36.391 --> 03:34:40.332]  Anthony Cumia in at InfoWars.com.
[03:34:40.332 --> 03:34:43.073]  Merry Christmas to everybody out there.
[03:34:43.073 --> 03:34:46.954]  This is my last broadcast here until the new year.
[03:34:46.954 --> 03:34:49.595]  So I want to talk a little bit about Christmas.
[03:34:52.074 --> 03:34:56.498]  I was saying just before that break, I get a bit nostalgic.
[03:34:56.498 --> 03:35:02.263]  I think everybody does when you think of Christmas.
[03:35:02.263 --> 03:35:08.128]  It's one of those times of the year when you reflect on your youth.
[03:35:08.128 --> 03:35:09.709]  It was such a big part of
[03:35:10.410 --> 03:35:24.079]  Of being a kid, your parents, family, friends, and you tend to remember all the good things when you think back and wax fantastic about days gone by.
[03:35:24.079 --> 03:35:33.106]  But I think it truly is one of those times a year where you do remember a lot of good things that actually happened.
[03:35:33.106 --> 03:35:35.027]  And I recall
[03:35:36.068 --> 03:35:40.310]  Uh, Christmas back, um, I guess it was, uh, the 70s.
[03:35:40.310 --> 03:35:43.571]  I could even remember, uh, people, ooh, late 60s.
[03:35:43.571 --> 03:35:45.232]  I do remember late 60s.
[03:35:45.232 --> 03:35:52.655]  Maybe first inklings of, uh, of thought process of your pal Anthony was probably 67, 68.
[03:35:52.655 --> 03:35:57.437]  I remember, um, I remember things like the Apollo program and, um,
[03:35:58.604 --> 03:36:10.054]  I used to go to the gas station with my dad and they would give away these little lunar modules that you'd put together like a little model and oh I loved that.
[03:36:10.054 --> 03:36:16.901]  I loved the space program and the pride it brought everyone here in the United States of America.
[03:36:17.701 --> 03:36:36.706]  Just those things from back then, and like I said before the break, when you say make America great again, and people see hashtag MAGA, and you get this, these people that laugh at it, or call it racist, or sexist.
[03:36:36.706 --> 03:36:46.208]  Oh, you want to go back to this time when people didn't have rights, and people were being beaten in the streets, and the... No.
[03:36:46.208 --> 03:36:46.288]  No.
[03:36:47.077 --> 03:37:00.603]  Every country, no matter how great it is, has had a period of time that people were being plagued by injustice.
[03:37:00.603 --> 03:37:05.125]  Doesn't matter how great the country was at the time, there were always problems.
[03:37:05.125 --> 03:37:07.086]  Nothing's perfect.
[03:37:07.086 --> 03:37:13.388]  And no, no one is talking about making America great again by returning to
[03:37:15.789 --> 03:37:23.594]  Injustices and nightmares of civil rights infringements and whatnot.
[03:37:23.594 --> 03:37:32.279]  No, but when you say make America great again, you're talking about a greatness of the people of this country.
[03:37:32.279 --> 03:37:37.582]  And what I said before about a cohesive people.
[03:37:37.582 --> 03:37:44.106]  Not everyone thinking the same, but just having a common thread of being American and being proud
[03:37:44.793 --> 03:37:57.561]  Of being American and who you are, your culture, your background, everything that that your ancestors brought here is part of what makes this country America.
[03:37:57.561 --> 03:38:00.863]  And I'm thinking back at Christmas and.
[03:38:00.863 --> 03:38:08.408]  And I remember coming into New York City as a kid during Christmas with my family and.
[03:38:08.408 --> 03:38:09.909]  It was just an amazing thing.
[03:38:10.859 --> 03:38:21.484]  The way this city is decorated, and no matter how repulsive New York can be, there tended to be this niceness that went along with it.
[03:38:21.484 --> 03:38:26.626]  People were in there from the suburbs just seeing what New York City was like at Christmas time.
[03:38:26.626 --> 03:38:27.567]  Very romantic.
[03:38:27.567 --> 03:38:32.329]  It's been portrayed in so many movies and whatnot.
[03:38:32.329 --> 03:38:38.332]  And then I walk around now, and I try to weigh some of the differences.
[03:38:39.833 --> 03:38:44.977]  Because as you know, Christmas in certain parts of the country is a bad word.
[03:38:44.977 --> 03:38:47.199]  It's not inclusive enough.
[03:38:47.199 --> 03:38:48.641]  It's racist.
[03:38:48.641 --> 03:38:51.103]  It's Islamophobic.
[03:38:51.103 --> 03:38:54.225]  It's so many terrible things.
[03:38:54.225 --> 03:38:59.830]  And as I say, when I hearken back to my youth, I just remember it as being great.
[03:38:59.830 --> 03:39:01.091]  Being just an amazing time.
[03:39:01.091 --> 03:39:03.213]  You're off of school, you're gonna get presents.
[03:39:04.702 --> 03:39:06.603]  Your family is there.
[03:39:06.603 --> 03:39:11.565]  There's a little bit more niceness in the streets.
[03:39:11.565 --> 03:39:14.246]  So walk around now and what do I see?
[03:39:14.246 --> 03:39:21.148]  I see soldiers with automatic weapons.
[03:39:21.148 --> 03:39:31.632]  I see cement barriers that are set up everywhere to protect people that are just trying to
[03:39:32.626 --> 03:39:39.209]  Shop and walk around and enjoy the sights and see the tree here and celebrate Christmas.
[03:39:39.209 --> 03:39:40.229]  Signs everywhere.
[03:39:40.229 --> 03:39:43.971]  See something, say something.
[03:39:43.971 --> 03:39:47.292]  There's an overhanging threat.
[03:39:47.292 --> 03:39:52.514]  A black cloud hovering over Christmas now.
[03:39:52.514 --> 03:39:53.374]  Everywhere.
[03:39:53.374 --> 03:39:54.955]  And this isn't exclusive to New York.
[03:39:54.955 --> 03:39:58.016]  This is every city.
[03:39:58.016 --> 03:39:58.376]  London.
[03:40:00.981 --> 03:40:02.943]  You see these same barriers.
[03:40:02.943 --> 03:40:10.389]  And look, they paint them red and white like they're supposed to be festive.
[03:40:10.389 --> 03:40:27.502]  This is a constant reminder that there are people out there and cultures out there that want us dead and want our traditions wiped from the face of the earth, including, yes, of course, Christmas.
[03:40:30.332 --> 03:40:36.014]  There's people in this very country that sympathize with that.
[03:40:36.014 --> 03:40:44.437]  That also want our traditions and cultures wiped away.
[03:40:44.437 --> 03:40:57.541]  When you used to come in to a big city and celebrate Christmas, at least like I said when I was a kid back in the late 60s, early 70s, you only thought about Christmas.
[03:40:58.730 --> 03:41:01.331]  And how much fun it was.
[03:41:01.331 --> 03:41:20.499]  And to walk around now and see the tree and the decorations and everything, it seemed to be... You still capture a little of that, but when you see men walking around various branches of the military and the police forces, walking around with automatic weapons, it's a constant reminder.
[03:41:20.499 --> 03:41:22.360]  And that's... it's just a sad thing.
[03:41:23.263 --> 03:41:32.325]  That we need to be constantly reminded, even at this time of year, that there are cultures that want to eliminate everything that we hold dear.
[03:41:32.325 --> 03:41:34.166]  And that is a tradition.
[03:41:34.166 --> 03:41:36.906]  There you go.
[03:41:36.906 --> 03:41:38.007]  That's great.
[03:41:38.007 --> 03:41:43.168]  And that's a tradition to America.
[03:41:43.168 --> 03:41:49.989]  That one of the many traditions that we built this country on.
[03:41:49.989 --> 03:41:51.890]  And that separates us
[03:41:52.580 --> 03:41:56.843]  From other countries and other cultures.
[03:41:56.843 --> 03:42:00.025]  You hear liberals constantly saying, live and let live.
[03:42:00.025 --> 03:42:02.207]  Let's be tolerant.
[03:42:02.207 --> 03:42:05.369]  We must accept this and that.
[03:42:05.369 --> 03:42:17.578]  Well, why are traditional American traditions the thing that can be sacrificed with impunity?
[03:42:17.578 --> 03:42:20.460]  And the second you start defending them,
[03:42:21.081 --> 03:42:25.524]  You are either a racist or homophobic or Islamophobic, something.
[03:42:25.524 --> 03:42:27.766]  Some kind of phobic or ist.
[03:42:27.766 --> 03:42:35.031]  When you're only defending traditions that you remember and that were great.
[03:42:35.031 --> 03:42:45.979]  When I think back to this country, the traditional Christmas with your family, going out in the city and seeing all the amazing things as a kid.
[03:42:45.979 --> 03:42:47.219]  Can we get back to that?
[03:42:47.219 --> 03:42:47.800]  I have no idea.
[03:42:48.597 --> 03:42:49.782]  Be back in moments.
[03:42:49.782 --> 03:42:50.385]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:50.385 --> 03:42:52.213]  Anthony Cumia, InfoWars.com.

[03:43:11.203 --> 03:43:13.723]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.

[03:44:24.620 --> 03:44:27.582]  And it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake.
[03:44:27.582 --> 03:44:30.844]  And then it's got the American flag, InfoWars.com on the right arm.
[03:44:30.844 --> 03:44:37.108]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[03:44:37.108 --> 03:44:40.270]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[03:44:40.270 --> 03:44:46.714]  Trigger Warning T-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[03:44:47.094 --> 03:44:54.957]  That is the new Shirt of the Mind, available exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.

[03:45:54.319 --> 03:45:59.460]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[03:45:59.460 --> 03:46:04.242]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[03:46:04.242 --> 03:46:12.924]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[03:46:12.924 --> 03:46:16.305]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics and
[03:46:16.425 --> 03:46:21.670]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[03:46:21.670 --> 03:46:28.977]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[03:46:28.977 --> 03:46:32.900]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[03:46:32.900 --> 03:46:37.625]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[03:46:37.625 --> 03:46:41.188]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care.
[03:46:41.508 --> 03:46:45.692]  And a 50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
[03:46:45.692 --> 03:46:49.895]  Head to Infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
[03:46:49.895 --> 03:46:57.622]  That's Infowarslife.com.

[03:48:51.267 --> 03:48:52.067]  Absolutely.
[03:48:53.166 --> 03:48:56.528]  Welcome back, Anthony Cumia in at InfoWars.com.
[03:48:56.528 --> 03:49:09.215]  Of course, the holiday season, Christmas time, and what would any Christmas be without the progressives trying to destroy our traditions?
[03:49:09.215 --> 03:49:11.897]  It is amazing.
[03:49:11.897 --> 03:49:15.659]  Christmas is a holiday that is just fair game.
[03:49:16.676 --> 03:49:34.692]  Fair game for anyone, any group that wants to trot upon it, trounce it, denounce it, twist it and turn it till it's barely recognizable to the offense of people that hold it dear as a tradition to them.
[03:49:36.124 --> 03:49:47.471]  But, again, people that celebrate Christmas traditionally through the liberal left, what we've seen from progressives, are the most intolerant people.
[03:49:47.471 --> 03:49:48.992]  So intolerant.
[03:49:48.992 --> 03:50:01.741]  Yet, they happen to be the most tolerant people ever because no one's rioting when these people just trounce on our traditions.
[03:50:01.741 --> 03:50:03.822]  You don't see riots, you don't see people
[03:50:04.711 --> 03:50:12.215]  Murdering or beating people in the streets because we've, uh, we've been offended by some of these things?
[03:50:12.215 --> 03:50:18.978]  I'm gonna tell you a little story here, and I want you to, um, to insert, uh, Muhammad in here.
[03:50:18.978 --> 03:50:19.899]  Or Islam.
[03:50:19.899 --> 03:50:22.100]  Or, or any other religion, really.
[03:50:22.100 --> 03:50:26.442]  Uh, CNN was hyping a new children's book.
[03:50:26.442 --> 03:50:27.743]  Isn't that adorable?
[03:50:27.743 --> 03:50:30.124]  A children's book about Santa.
[03:50:30.124 --> 03:50:33.626]  This is great, right?
[03:50:33.626 --> 03:50:34.086]  Uh, yeah.
[03:50:35.070 --> 03:50:45.895]  Uh, we suppose there's supposed to be some sort of shock factor involved in learning there's a children's book called Santa's Husband.
[03:50:45.895 --> 03:50:49.237]  In which Santa is black and gay!
[03:50:49.237 --> 03:50:54.720]  But frankly, now that we're aware of it, we'd be more surprised if there wasn't such a thing.
[03:50:54.720 --> 03:50:55.200]  Would we?
[03:50:56.474 --> 03:51:07.859]  Would we be more surprised if there wasn't such a thing as Santa's husband where Santa is black and gay?
[03:51:07.859 --> 03:51:25.927]  After seeing the gativity scene with two Josephs, the gativity scene, why do they always pick Christianity?
[03:51:26.972 --> 03:51:36.018]  Whenever a group wants to crap all over a religion, it will always be Christianity.
[03:51:36.018 --> 03:51:50.627]  And the traditional holidays and services, figures, religious figures of Christianity constantly.
[03:51:50.627 --> 03:51:55.150]  They are able to make Santa Joseph gay.
[03:51:56.118 --> 03:51:59.099]  Change their race, make them gay.
[03:51:59.099 --> 03:52:02.019]  Which would be an affront to, oh my god, could you imagine?
[03:52:02.019 --> 03:52:10.621]  Look, I don't know if this is proper to say, but just imagine you did HOMO HAMMOD.
[03:52:10.621 --> 03:52:11.721]  Do you think that would fly?
[03:52:11.721 --> 03:52:20.562]  Do you think everyone involved with doing something like that would need to strap on Kevlar to go to work every day?
[03:52:20.562 --> 03:52:23.743]  Lest they be gunned down or blown up?
[03:52:23.743 --> 03:52:24.023]  I do.
[03:52:25.157 --> 03:52:26.958]  I absolutely do.
[03:52:26.958 --> 03:52:28.338]  You know why?
[03:52:28.338 --> 03:52:31.140]  Intolerance.
[03:52:31.140 --> 03:52:47.606]  We talk about, or the progressives talk about Christianity and Christmas and all of the holidays pretty much and our traditions and basic values of Christianity as being intolerant.
[03:52:47.606 --> 03:52:53.449]  Yet when our religion and our culture and value system gets crapped on,
[03:52:54.634 --> 03:52:56.375]  We just take it.
[03:52:56.375 --> 03:52:59.576]  We literally turn the other cheek.
[03:52:59.576 --> 03:53:00.877]  Complain about it.
[03:53:00.877 --> 03:53:01.637]  Talk about it.
[03:53:01.637 --> 03:53:03.578]  That is our right.
[03:53:03.578 --> 03:53:05.939]  That is our right.
[03:53:05.939 --> 03:53:08.220]  But do we take to the streets?
[03:53:08.220 --> 03:53:09.540]  Do we destroy property?
[03:53:09.540 --> 03:53:10.721]  Do we assault people?
[03:53:10.721 --> 03:53:12.781]  Do we murder people because of it?
[03:53:12.781 --> 03:53:13.682]  No.
[03:53:13.682 --> 03:53:17.123]  Because we are tolerant.
[03:53:17.123 --> 03:53:22.805]  It's another one of these crazy, backward world things that go on when you talk about progressives.
[03:53:25.217 --> 03:53:28.178]  Just a grave intolerance going on.
[03:53:28.178 --> 03:53:29.799]  We all remember Charlie Hebdo.
[03:53:29.799 --> 03:53:34.581]  Oh boy, were they in Dutch when they tried to talk about Islam.
[03:53:34.581 --> 03:53:41.504]  Yet Christianity can just be used and abused by people.
[03:53:41.504 --> 03:53:43.065]  The gay-tivity scene.
[03:53:43.065 --> 03:53:46.667]  I've never heard of the gay-tivity scene.
[03:53:46.667 --> 03:53:51.949]  And now I'm just hearing about Santa being gay and black.
[03:53:51.949 --> 03:53:52.349]  There it is.
[03:53:52.349 --> 03:53:53.830]  Is that the gay-tivity scene?
[03:53:54.858 --> 03:54:09.847]  Now, any other religion, using any other religious figures in this way, I would say that that house would be in flames in no time.
[03:54:09.847 --> 03:54:17.672]  But, they're able to do this, they practice their freedom of expression on their own property, and they get complaints
[03:54:18.433 --> 03:54:25.799]  They get people like myself and other people in independent media that might criticize it.
[03:54:25.799 --> 03:54:33.185]  But no one's going over there and kicking it over or throwing a Molotov cocktail through their window.
[03:54:33.185 --> 03:54:41.271]  Because the progressives version of the most intolerant people are the most tolerant people.
[03:54:41.271 --> 03:54:44.193]  Topsy-turvy backward world that we live in.
[03:54:44.193 --> 03:54:44.954]  I must talk.
[03:54:45.481 --> 03:54:50.784]  Quickly about Rosie O'Donnell, the giant gift that keeps giving.
[03:54:50.784 --> 03:54:52.444]  Rosie O'Donnell.
[03:54:52.444 --> 03:54:59.068]  She's lost her mind since Trump even said he was running for president.
[03:54:59.068 --> 03:55:05.751]  A few years back, her and Donald Trump were in a bit of a battle when he was still with The Apprentice.
[03:55:05.751 --> 03:55:14.515]  And she was so angry with Donald Trump's tax plan that looks like it will come to fruition.
[03:55:15.788 --> 03:55:22.932]  That she offered two senators $2 million each to vote no on it.
[03:55:22.932 --> 03:55:25.393]  To vote no.
[03:55:25.393 --> 03:55:27.554]  This is a crime!
[03:55:27.554 --> 03:55:28.294]  There it is.
[03:55:28.294 --> 03:55:36.979]  She promised to give $2 million to Senator Susan Collins and $2 million to Senator Jake Flake to vote no on the tax bill.
[03:55:36.979 --> 03:55:38.940]  $2 million!
[03:55:40.854 --> 03:55:43.116]  Apparently, this is against the 18 U.S.
[03:55:43.116 --> 03:55:49.879]  Code 201 criminalizing the attempt of bribery of federal officials by whoever.
[03:55:49.879 --> 03:55:56.643]  And apparently, you will be fined three times the amount of the bribe.
[03:55:56.643 --> 03:56:06.608]  So she could be fined $12 million and go to prison for doing this.
[03:56:06.608 --> 03:56:07.849]  She's insane.
[03:56:09.008 --> 03:56:12.029]  Much like the progressive left is insane.
[03:56:12.029 --> 03:56:18.151]  But I give her one pass, and it's like my good friend Michael Malice said on my show yesterday.
[03:56:18.151 --> 03:56:19.411]  Think about it.
[03:56:19.411 --> 03:56:31.775]  This is a guy that called her fat, called her a slob, said that if she doesn't watch her step, he will take her girlfriend away, and believe me, I can do it.
[03:56:31.775 --> 03:56:33.095]  Trump said all these things.
[03:56:33.095 --> 03:56:34.116]  Hilarious.
[03:56:34.116 --> 03:56:35.416]  Hilarious.
[03:56:35.416 --> 03:56:38.137]  That guy is now the president.
[03:56:40.231 --> 03:56:47.456]  Imagine somebody that you have perceived as bullying you over the years and calling you horrible things.
[03:56:47.456 --> 03:56:54.261]  And not only do they get away with it, they become the leader of the free world.
[03:56:54.261 --> 03:57:04.088]  So I almost give Rosie O'Donnell a pass on her insanity.
[03:57:04.088 --> 03:57:06.549]  The rest of the left, I don't know what it is.
[03:57:06.549 --> 03:57:08.631]  Self-destructive personality.
[03:57:09.868 --> 03:57:31.719]  What have you, but I really do hope some branch of the judicial system goes after Rosie O'Donnell for offering millions of dollars in bribery to senators to vote no on a bill that a legally elected president and Congress voted on.
[03:57:32.859 --> 03:57:33.880]  She's out of her mind.
[03:57:33.880 --> 03:57:36.563]  Thank you very much, InfoWars, Alex Jones.
