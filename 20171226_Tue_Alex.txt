[00:00.000 --> 00:23.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was just recently asked by some family if they thought it would be
[00:23.680 --> 00:29.600]  a good idea to take the Amtrak train down from Washington down Highway 1, one of the
[00:29.600 --> 00:35.360]  most scenic routes in the world, to San Francisco on a classic two-day trip, and I said I wouldn't
[00:35.360 --> 00:42.680]  get on an Amtrak train if my life depended on it, and I sure wouldn't bring my children
[00:42.680 --> 00:49.280]  on one, because they haven't updated the rail beds in 60 years.
[00:49.280 --> 00:53.600]  We have worse rail beds than Mexico.
[00:53.600 --> 00:58.760]  That's why trains can go 250 miles an hour in Japan or in Germany, but not in the U.S.
[00:58.760 --> 01:03.880]  My grandmother, when she was going to college, would shoot down from East Texas to get her
[01:03.880 --> 01:08.680]  masters in Houston on a train that went 135 miles an hour.
[01:08.680 --> 01:11.600]  Now they can't go 40 miles an hour on that same track.
[01:11.600 --> 01:16.720]  Here it is, train wreck Tacoma, death toll unknown, 80 mile an hour flew off the track.
[01:16.720 --> 01:20.320]  Looks like it's obviously had a bunch of passengers on board, pray for those folks.
[01:20.320 --> 01:22.520]  That's all coming up, so much more.
[01:22.520 --> 01:26.400]  Obama's been caught working with Hezbollah to deal drugs, that's mainstream news.
[01:26.400 --> 01:31.000]  You cannot make this up, but first, powerful report by John Baum, Mueller ignores the Fourth
[01:31.000 --> 01:33.000]  Amendment to foam in a coup.
[01:33.000 --> 01:41.200]  It's not looking good, it's quite sad to see that, so my people were very upset about
[01:41.200 --> 01:42.200]  it.
[01:42.200 --> 01:47.680]  I can't imagine there's anything on them, frankly, because as we said, there's no collusion.
[01:47.680 --> 01:54.880]  There's no collusion whatsoever, but a lot of lawyers thought that was pretty sad.
[01:54.880 --> 01:59.320]  What does the Fourth Amendment mean to special counsel Robert Mueller's bogus, deep state
[01:59.320 --> 02:02.000]  investigation of the commander in chief?
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.320]  Well, as you would expect, nothing.
[02:04.320 --> 02:09.520]  In a letter obtained by Fox News and sent to House and Senate committees on Saturday,
[02:09.520 --> 02:15.640]  the transition team's attorney alleges unlawful conduct by the career staff at the General
[02:15.640 --> 02:21.560]  Services Administration and handing over transition documents to the special counsel's office.
[02:21.560 --> 02:28.640]  Corey Langhofer, the counsel to Trump for America, argues the GSA did not own or control
[02:28.640 --> 02:33.360]  the records in question, and the release of documents could be a violation of the Fourth
[02:33.360 --> 02:37.520]  Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.
[02:37.520 --> 02:42.920]  The emails are said to be of a sensitive nature regarding Trump's interior conversations
[02:42.920 --> 02:46.680]  about nominees, not to mention executive policy.
[02:46.680 --> 02:52.520]  However, once it was added to the spin cycle of the mainstream media, special counsel Mueller
[02:52.520 --> 02:54.880]  came out smelling as fresh as a daisy.
[02:54.880 --> 03:01.400]  But this has been a months-long, orchestrated, frankly, pathetic and also dangerous attack
[03:01.400 --> 03:06.080]  by Fox News, by many in the conservative right to try to discredit Mueller.
[03:06.080 --> 03:11.600]  This is what they're doing is they're setting up the ground game to fire Mueller.
[03:11.600 --> 03:14.920]  And let me tell you, the American, majority of American people will not allow this move
[03:14.920 --> 03:24.320]  on, has had more than 80,000 people sign up for a protest, if in case Mueller is indeed
[03:24.320 --> 03:28.240]  fired, over 500 events across the country.
[03:28.240 --> 03:30.160]  People are not going to take this.
[03:30.160 --> 03:34.960]  Except the Harvard Harris poll released recently said 54 percent of Americans of all parties
[03:34.960 --> 03:37.080]  see the investigators as biased against Trump.
[03:37.080 --> 03:40.040]  So you may see it on your end, but polling shows different.
[03:40.040 --> 03:41.040]  That's one poll.
[03:41.040 --> 03:42.040]  There are many polls out there.
[03:42.040 --> 03:43.040]  This is a total distract.
[03:43.040 --> 03:47.280]  Let me just say, this whole discussion is so interesting to me because it's all part
[03:47.280 --> 03:53.160]  of the Trump legal team assault on the integrity of law enforcement in this country, intended
[03:53.160 --> 04:01.680]  to distract people from the investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and its
[04:01.680 --> 04:04.120]  officials and Russian interference.
[04:04.120 --> 04:07.800]  And this is all a setup, potentially, to fire Bob Mueller.
[04:07.800 --> 04:13.040]  When Trump's lawyers come out and use the press to say, Mueller's acting unlawfully,
[04:13.040 --> 04:17.880]  that creates a narrative for right-wing media to put on the bottom of the screen, to put
[04:17.880 --> 04:23.560]  in banner headlines on the website, to add more fodder to this narrative that the Mueller
[04:23.560 --> 04:25.840]  probe is illegitimate and needs to be shut down.
[04:25.840 --> 04:29.560]  I believe that the president wants all of this shut down.
[04:29.560 --> 04:36.080]  He wants to shut down these investigations, and he wants to fire special counsel Mueller.
[04:36.080 --> 04:41.120]  The rumor on the Hill when I left yesterday was that the president was going to make a
[04:41.120 --> 04:49.160]  significant speech at the end of next week and on December 22nd, when we are out of D.C.,
[04:49.160 --> 04:52.440]  he was going to fire Robert Mueller.
[04:52.440 --> 04:58.080]  Oddly enough, as the world turns, regardless of the beating of the dead horse of Russia
[04:58.080 --> 05:00.080]  and the collusion with the White House, we'll be back, stay with us.
[05:00.080 --> 05:02.080]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[05:02.080 --> 05:03.080]  Go ahead.
[05:03.080 --> 05:05.400]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[05:05.400 --> 05:09.040]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save
[05:09.040 --> 05:15.840]  America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[05:15.840 --> 05:21.320]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force,
[05:21.320 --> 05:22.320]  Anthroplex.
[05:22.320 --> 05:24.720]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex, too.
[05:24.720 --> 05:25.720]  Thank you.
[05:25.720 --> 05:29.600]  Thanks to Biotru Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big, normal
[05:29.600 --> 05:30.600]  toothpaste fans.
[05:30.600 --> 05:32.440]  The super blue is awesome.
[05:32.440 --> 05:35.360]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[05:35.360 --> 05:36.560]  They are quality.
[05:36.560 --> 05:38.520]  I can't wait to get some more.
[05:38.520 --> 05:41.520]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[05:41.520 --> 05:42.520]  Absolutely.
[05:42.520 --> 05:48.280]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand
[05:48.280 --> 05:52.640]  that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be
[05:52.640 --> 06:02.800]  good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[06:02.800 --> 06:03.800]  We've got it.
[06:03.800 --> 06:09.840]  That Christmas is coming to you.
[06:09.840 --> 06:11.800]  Waging war on corruption.
[06:11.800 --> 06:14.280]  All right, you are in trouble.
[06:14.280 --> 06:19.840]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[06:19.840 --> 06:42.760]  It was Lieutenant Colonel Matt Smithmack that joined us a year and a half ago on the broadcast.
[06:42.760 --> 06:52.080]  And he laid out how a shipment was going from a specific Arizona base of hundreds of millions
[06:52.080 --> 06:55.960]  of dollars of weapons, some of them high impact.
[06:55.960 --> 07:01.840]  That's grenade launchers, anti-tank weapons, you name it, to the Mexican cartels and then
[07:01.840 --> 07:09.400]  to Hezbollah, but also to ISIS to fund both sides, breaking fast and furious with secret
[07:09.400 --> 07:19.520]  program to ship arms to Middle East terrorists, Haddon Salazar, March 30th, 2016.
[07:19.520 --> 07:27.280]  Now he got physically attacked for coming on the broadcast and death-threaded his family,
[07:27.280 --> 07:30.280]  you name it.
[07:30.280 --> 07:33.200]  So again, three people attacking from behind.
[07:33.200 --> 07:40.400]  And of course, Tosh Plumlee is a very famous CIA whistleblower, he recommended Mr. Smithmack.
[07:40.400 --> 07:45.560]  Tosh Plumlee is basically in hiding right now in South America.
[07:45.560 --> 07:48.520]  So that's what you have to go through to come on this show and do this stuff.
[07:48.520 --> 07:51.840]  These are very honorable men.
[07:51.840 --> 07:54.680]  And because of them, we now have this information.
[07:54.680 --> 07:56.680]  It's Politico.
[07:56.680 --> 08:02.520]  They're not going to give us credit, but it's all right here.
[08:02.520 --> 08:04.480]  And we'll give you the rest of the story.
[08:04.480 --> 08:10.880]  Obama letting Hezbollah deal cocaine all over Europe and all over the United States
[08:10.880 --> 08:20.080]  and work with Mexican drug cartels to ship drugs into this country.
[08:20.080 --> 08:23.840]  And the big story was Obama wasn't just letting them do it.
[08:23.840 --> 08:29.520]  He was shipping them anti-tank weapons, you name it.
[08:29.520 --> 08:33.160]  You go, why would they fund ISIS and Hezbollah?
[08:33.160 --> 08:39.600]  Because they want a crisis and a pretext to then move the U.S. military into the area.
[08:39.600 --> 08:43.720]  Trump is reportedly not being cynical in trying to clean it all up and then hopefully leave.
[08:43.720 --> 08:47.720]  The problem is McMaster is ignoring that, keeping U.S. bases in Syria.
[08:47.720 --> 08:55.280]  And now it's come out from our sources and mainstream news, our refueling, re-preparing,
[08:55.280 --> 09:01.400]  re-branding ISIS right now in counter-valence of the president.
[09:01.400 --> 09:05.680]  You are getting absolute total exclusive here.
[09:05.680 --> 09:08.480]  You realize how dangerous this is.
[09:08.480 --> 09:11.320]  And I'm saying this is not pearls before swine, is it?
[09:11.320 --> 09:15.880]  We're going to get some clips because this all just came together this morning.
[09:15.880 --> 09:21.440]  And right before I went live, I went Lieutenant Colonel Matt Smithmack, because the name
[09:21.440 --> 09:25.960]  is, you know, is rare, and then he tells me, what was his name?
[09:25.960 --> 09:26.960]  What was his name?
[09:26.960 --> 09:27.960]  What was his name?
[09:27.960 --> 09:28.960]  What was his name?
[09:28.960 --> 09:31.160]  And the crew found it in literal minutes and it all just clicked again.
[09:31.160 --> 09:32.160]  He laid it all out.
[09:32.160 --> 09:39.520]  Now, it's classified, so he couldn't give the specific weapons or any of it, but that's
[09:39.520 --> 09:46.120]  an active duty guy coming out and saying, Obama has his order to ship these weapons
[09:46.120 --> 09:47.600]  in three weeks.
[09:47.600 --> 09:50.960]  Can you believe how much courage it took for him to do that?
[09:50.960 --> 09:52.800]  People keep saying, when are we going to see the courage?
[09:52.800 --> 09:54.840]  When are we going to see people stop this?
[09:54.840 --> 09:55.840]  Well, you just saw it.
[09:55.840 --> 09:58.280]  We should have stayed in contact with Matt.
[09:58.280 --> 10:01.240]  We just have so many powerful whistleblowers and patriots on that.
[10:01.240 --> 10:02.400]  I don't take him for granted.
[10:02.400 --> 10:07.080]  We're just in such a war politically in the information war and a pile of brass around
[10:07.080 --> 10:11.960]  us that we just, it's the fog of war here, but this is incredible out of all the huge
[10:11.960 --> 10:14.240]  news we've got.
[10:14.240 --> 10:19.480]  Everyone's focused on the tragic 80 mile an hour Amtrak flying off the rails, passenger
[10:19.480 --> 10:26.000]  train looks bad, no death toll yet, drugs report.com and full wars.com.
[10:26.000 --> 10:31.440]  We have the latest, but you add this to Obama working with Iran in one sided deals and Obama
[10:31.440 --> 10:38.360]  doing side deals and Obama working with the Arab Spring as well.
[10:38.360 --> 10:42.240]  The secret backstory of how Obama let Hezbollah off the hook.
[10:42.240 --> 10:48.360]  That's the whitewash from Politico because they know that Trump and his people are now
[10:48.360 --> 10:55.680]  on this and that Obama is in deep trouble and they could get a lot of trouble for what
[10:55.680 --> 10:58.560]  they've done if we focus on it and talk about it.
[10:58.560 --> 11:07.320]  And you've now got Congressman Bud Cummins, Congressman Jim Jordan, Congressman Trey Gowdy,
[11:07.320 --> 11:09.680]  all saying the FBI committed crimes.
[11:09.680 --> 11:18.760]  It was a group of organized, stay-behind network engaged in organized crime fraud against Trump
[11:18.760 --> 11:20.240]  and the American people.
[11:20.240 --> 11:25.280]  We have them with their organized conspiracy, the entire operation of a tight-knit group,
[11:25.280 --> 11:33.520]  coming, struck, the just department official, his wife heading up, fusing GPS, hired to
[11:33.520 --> 11:35.360]  create the fake dossier.
[11:35.360 --> 11:38.600]  I mean, it is a tight-knit group.
[11:38.600 --> 11:43.600]  It isn't the general FBI and it's because of good people in the FBI and in the military
[11:43.600 --> 11:48.760]  and in the ATF, quite frankly, not defending that bad agency, there's some good people
[11:48.760 --> 11:52.680]  that we know all this, so it's all coming together and I want to put the clips together
[11:52.680 --> 11:53.680]  today.
[11:53.680 --> 11:58.440]  I've got the crew on it with all the different statements because now you've got the former
[11:58.440 --> 12:04.120]  deputy director of the FBI, we played that yesterday coming out and saying, these people
[12:04.120 --> 12:08.960]  belong in Leavenworth, we'll play that clip by the way when we come back from break, they
[12:08.960 --> 12:18.040]  belong in Leavenworth and Adon Salazar deserves the Pulitzer Prize for working weeks on this
[12:18.040 --> 12:27.240]  story and the Lieutenant Colonel deserves to really be defended, but instead he got
[12:27.240 --> 12:35.720]  cracked down on, he got threatened, he got physically attacked and we gave him our number
[12:35.720 --> 12:41.760]  and our info, we never heard from him again, God, who knows he's even among us anymore?
[12:41.760 --> 12:46.200]  Plumlee's in South America, we know where, we doesn't want us to tell anybody.
[12:46.200 --> 12:50.400]  That's right, Tos Plumlee has gone to South America over this.
[12:50.400 --> 12:56.760]  He's had to leave the United States, very famous CIA contractor, Newfield Castro, knows
[12:56.760 --> 13:04.000]  all the big cartels, ran whole CIA operations, has left the building over this because there
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.680]  is a war going on behind the scenes and they told Plumlee, off air he told me this on there,
[13:08.680 --> 13:12.440]  he said he was getting threatened, they said, listen old man, Rue come to your house and
[13:12.440 --> 13:19.560]  cut your GD head off, he said fine, I'm dumping everything on you and then he left the country.
[13:19.560 --> 13:23.040]  This is a guy who really retired three years ago that would be on the show with a line
[13:23.040 --> 13:31.280]  of C-130s lined up, loaded with heavy weapons to be delivered to ISIS, calling in saying,
[13:31.280 --> 13:34.800]  I got sources in NATO and the Pentagon and everywhere else that they're delivering, I
[13:34.800 --> 13:39.440]  got weapons, hold on, hold on, we got to wait for all these aircrafts, you were supposed
[13:39.440 --> 13:42.800]  to call them 50 minutes ago and I told people that were with them, there's like a line
[13:42.800 --> 13:46.880]  of 10 aircraft about to deliver all the weapons and he's going, I've got sources they're delivering
[13:46.880 --> 13:51.560]  these weapons.
[13:51.560 --> 13:56.400]  So you think about all that ladies and gentlemen, that's what's going on here, that's what
[13:56.400 --> 14:02.680]  we're doing, Trump's not doing stuff like that, but McMaster who remember said we are
[14:02.680 --> 14:05.920]  going to invade Syria, we are going to take Assad out, remember six months ago and Trump
[14:05.920 --> 14:09.320]  comes out and goes, no you're not, that's not true, stop it.
[14:09.320 --> 14:13.720]  But they built up these big forces right over the Iraqi border and they are reconstituting
[14:13.720 --> 14:18.240]  the groups to go in and try to topple Assad again, that's why the Russians just pulled
[14:18.240 --> 14:22.680]  their troops out to take the high road to say just pull your troops out, follow the
[14:22.680 --> 14:28.800]  agreement, don't overthrow this country that allows secular people and minority Christians
[14:28.800 --> 14:31.960]  and others to live there, stop, stop.
[14:31.960 --> 14:38.000]  But Trump as you've seen has his agenda frustrated at every single level, people say oh he's
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.720]  playing a double game, no he's not, I know people that talk to the president, days after
[14:42.720 --> 14:47.600]  McMaster said that they were going to go in, he said no we're not, no boots on the ground
[14:47.600 --> 14:52.720]  and I'm going to make a statement on it and then he made a statement on it and that's
[14:52.720 --> 14:56.640]  why they were flipping out because Trump was able to talk to people then that would bring
[14:56.640 --> 15:00.440]  this stuff up and say Mr. President, this is your promise, you said that, you know it's
[15:00.440 --> 15:03.960]  a quagmire, you know we need to stabilize the region, not being there trying to stir
[15:03.960 --> 15:08.480]  things up, that's the old globalist agenda, don't have to tell me that, absolutely.
[15:08.480 --> 15:16.180]  What you're saying McMaster is on television saying that, yes sir he said it on CNN yesterday.
[15:16.180 --> 15:22.680]  So they sneak around like bad children, seeing what they can get away with and they become
[15:22.680 --> 15:28.480]  outraged when people get a hold of them and tell them what's going on, that's why it's
[15:28.480 --> 15:33.360]  important for people to talk to the president when he goes out to speak or his security

[20:03.300 --> 20:10.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:33.300 --> 20:46.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live. And by the way, we're in the middle of the kickoff
[20:46.940 --> 20:54.340]  of the 34-hour transmission to celebrate our free open society, the return of the republic,
[20:54.340 --> 20:59.660]  the global awakening, and to say the words that the globalists hate so much, Merry Christmas
[20:59.660 --> 21:09.900]  in their lust to dominate and control and dumb down civilization. Now, there is so much
[21:09.900 --> 21:18.220]  to go over, obviously, here today and so many big developments happening, but I was reading
[21:18.220 --> 21:23.220]  leftist and globalist publications this weekend and they're panicking. They're saying Mueller
[21:23.220 --> 21:29.620]  needs our help. He needs demonstrations. Mueller needs people in the streets. Mueller
[21:29.620 --> 21:34.300]  needs a congressional investigation to intensify. Mueller needs us because he's not going to
[21:34.300 --> 21:41.740]  be able to get Trump impeached. It's falling apart. Congressman Jim Jordan's being mean.
[21:41.740 --> 21:49.780]  Trey Gowdy's being mean. Former FBI Deputy Director James Colstrom's being mean. Congressman
[21:49.780 --> 21:59.700]  Bud Cummings is being mean. Now, there it is. There's Brian's delters saying Mueller is
[21:59.700 --> 22:04.700]  under attack. He's under attack. He's running around bullying people, getting stuff without
[22:04.700 --> 22:10.220]  warrants, spying on folks, manufacturing evidence up to his eyeballs with the Russians, but
[22:10.220 --> 22:18.420]  he's under attack. That means Trump's fighting back. That means that they've then got a whine
[22:18.420 --> 22:24.220]  in complaint. They can dish it out, but they can't take it because they know, ladies and
[22:24.220 --> 22:30.500]  gentlemen, that they've been caught committing massive, massive crimes and massive fraud
[22:30.500 --> 22:36.340]  against our electoral process against our president. Now Scarborough slams Fox News for
[22:36.340 --> 22:42.940]  fomenting a constitutional crisis could lead to violence. Oh, they're the ones fomenting
[22:42.940 --> 22:46.460]  violence with Antifa. They're the ones calling for constitutional crisis going back a year
[22:46.460 --> 22:51.340]  ago when Trump was president-elect. They're the ones that I've been warning you we're
[22:51.340 --> 22:56.180]  building towards this, and then when they finally trigger it, they're going to turn
[22:56.180 --> 23:02.700]  around and say we did it. No, Hillary stole the election from Bernie Sanders. The nomination.
[23:02.700 --> 23:07.140]  Hillary tried to steal it from Trump. You're the guys that are in bed with the Russians
[23:07.140 --> 23:10.780]  and the Communist Chinese. You're the ones that sold out the country. You're the ones
[23:10.780 --> 23:16.540]  that manufactured the dossier. You're the ones that have been caught. And now you're
[23:16.540 --> 23:21.820]  getting more shrill. You're getting more panic. You're getting more crazy and the weak-minded
[23:21.820 --> 23:27.940]  people that follow you and buy into all this, they're getting more violent. They're attacking
[23:27.940 --> 23:32.700]  more people. They're shooting more Republicans. Their neighbors are Republican. They shoot
[23:32.700 --> 23:36.820]  them. Their neighbors are Republican congressmen. They shoot them. Their neighbor is a Republican
[23:36.820 --> 23:41.380]  legislator. They shoot them or a mayor. This is the new, oh, you're a Republican on the
[23:41.380 --> 23:47.180]  city council. I'm going to shoot you because you're a Nazi and I'm a soldier in D-Day fighting
[23:47.180 --> 23:51.700]  you because it's so horrible what Trump's done. Trying to restore that country. Trying
[23:51.700 --> 23:55.220]  to break the back of political correctness. It's so horrible that you live in this echo
[23:55.220 --> 24:03.300]  chamber that we've got to go attack our Republican neighbors like Rand Paul right now. So that's
[24:03.300 --> 24:09.300]  where this is. And now Scarborough says the violence is coming. The violence is coming
[24:09.300 --> 24:16.020]  because they've been caught making up the assaults that Trump supposedly engaged in,
[24:16.020 --> 24:20.700]  making up the Russia gate, making up what he's done with the economy. But as the economy
[24:20.700 --> 24:27.620]  begins to come back, their panic only intensifies and they've been caught. Their whole hope,
[24:27.620 --> 24:36.580]  the insurance policy to bring down Trump has now been blown into a trillion little pieces.
[24:36.580 --> 24:43.980]  And when is McCabe going to resign? The director of the FBI. When is Mueller going to get indicted?
[24:43.980 --> 24:48.860]  You see, that's why they're spinning it now that Trump better not fire Mueller. Trump better
[24:48.860 --> 24:54.860]  not fire Mueller. That's the line of the sand for nationwide riots. That proves he's corrupt.
[24:54.860 --> 25:00.260]  Well, he should be fired for all the fraud he's involved in. But hey, leave it there.
[25:00.260 --> 25:05.860]  Go, oh no, Mueller is going to stay. And Trump comes out all weekend in statements and says,
[25:05.860 --> 25:11.260]  I'm not firing him. He's a disgrace. He's a joke. He's a fraud. They go, don't attack
[25:11.260 --> 25:16.100]  him. Don't bring up that you got the emails and the text to how it's all an open and shut
[25:16.100 --> 25:24.340]  conspiracy by your operatives in the FBI to take out the duly elected president. So that's
[25:24.340 --> 25:27.620]  why Trump says, I'm not considering firing special counsel, but they don't stop. They
[25:27.620 --> 25:31.340]  don't stop. They don't stop. They don't stop. They come out day after day and say, yes,
[25:31.340 --> 25:37.300]  you are absolutely red line. Eric Holder, the incredibly corrupt former head of the
[25:37.300 --> 25:40.900]  justice department that was involved in all these cover ups and uranium one and everything
[25:40.900 --> 25:46.820]  calls for protestive Trump fires Mueller. Remember what Antifa came out a few days ago and said,
[25:46.820 --> 25:51.820]  we're going to have nationwide basically rampages and be fires. And notice he then says exactly
[25:51.820 --> 25:57.340]  what they said because it's all a Soros playbook. And here's another one. Trump, my people
[25:57.340 --> 26:02.180]  are very upset about Mueller obtaining emails illegally which show nothing. They claim that's
[26:02.180 --> 26:07.420]  being mean to Mueller to point out you violated my rights. You swat team grade all these people.
[26:07.420 --> 26:14.380]  You got caught lying. You lied to get a fake warrant. That's bullying to stand up yourself.
[26:14.380 --> 26:18.060]  Mueller walks over and stabs Trump right in the chest and Trump says, that's not very
[26:18.060 --> 26:23.580]  nice. And they go, how dare you? I just stabbed you.
[26:23.580 --> 26:27.980]  Trump's transition lawyer Mueller and properly obtained documents in Russia probe. He would
[26:27.980 --> 26:33.060]  see it admits that he breaks the law. And the real problem is he trumped unveil America
[26:33.060 --> 26:38.260]  first national security strategy today. That's why they're so upset. So let's play a few
[26:38.260 --> 26:44.060]  clips. Here is James Colstrom on Fox over the weekend, former deputy director of the
[26:44.060 --> 26:49.260]  FBI saying these people belong in Leavenworth. Here it is.
[26:49.260 --> 26:57.220]  What can an FBI official and FBI agent do to stop a president from getting elected?
[26:57.220 --> 27:02.180]  Well I think he can do what this guy tried to do. He can fabricate things. He can make
[27:02.180 --> 27:08.380]  up stuff. He can lie. He can be a total moron. He can recruit others. You know, he belongs
[27:08.380 --> 27:12.380]  in Leavenworth this guy in my personal view. I don't have all the facts, but from what
[27:12.380 --> 27:19.060]  I know he belongs behind bars this guy. You know, these things cannot happen in a democracy.
[27:19.060 --> 27:23.900]  Yep. Total fraud. Let's go ahead. Here's Bud Cummings. Here's part of the clips. Congressman
[27:23.900 --> 27:28.620]  takes on the FBI plot and exposes the FBI plot against Trump.
[27:28.620 --> 27:32.500]  So let's go through some of these issues. I mean, the number three guy at the Department
[27:32.500 --> 27:40.900]  of Justice, the number three guy hires his wife who works for Fusion GPS. She's hired
[27:40.900 --> 27:46.900]  to do research about Trump colluding with the Russians. At the same time that we know
[27:46.900 --> 27:53.180]  that Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation took $140 million after allowing the sale
[27:53.180 --> 27:59.180]  of 20% of the U.S.'s stockpile of uranium, some people call that treason. That happened
[27:59.180 --> 28:05.900]  and yet Bruce Orr's wife is hired who works for Fusion GPS. They come up with this dossier
[28:05.900 --> 28:11.140]  which we know is a bunch of garbage and that's actually the justification for wiretapping
[28:11.140 --> 28:16.580]  the Trump Organization? Yeah. I mean, we find ourselves here. It appears
[28:16.580 --> 28:22.100]  on the basis of a fraud that was perpetuated on the FBI and the Department of Justice and
[28:22.100 --> 28:29.980]  the United States intelligence agencies to form a predicate based on this fake dossier.
[28:29.980 --> 28:33.940]  And there are people along the chain that knew or should have known where it came from,
[28:33.940 --> 28:39.700]  who paid for it and how credible it was. But it was used for foreign surveillance. It was
[28:39.700 --> 28:44.980]  used to unmask United States citizens. And then it was formed as a predicate for a special
[28:44.980 --> 28:51.020]  counsel that's that we're going to come back with the rest. This is so critical what you're
[28:51.020 --> 28:55.380]  watching ladies and gentlemen. The whole thing is coming down a criminal conspiracy of Democrats
[28:55.380 --> 29:05.060]  inside to engage in fraud against everyone. We believe in freedom. America needs strong

[32:04.380 --> 32:10.460]  in a glass bottle, two month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the
[32:10.460 --> 32:16.740]  real red pill. This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulus
[32:16.740 --> 32:22.940]  in it, but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that. Quite frankly, I just went off
[32:22.940 --> 32:27.660]  what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription,
[32:27.660 --> 32:33.340]  but they were charging people a hundred, two hundred dollars for the formulae and I came
[32:33.340 --> 32:38.300]  up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers non GMO made right
[32:38.300 --> 32:44.740]  here in America, 120 capsules. And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglonone to it, which
[32:44.740 --> 32:49.540]  is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones
[32:49.540 --> 32:57.620]  in your glands. It is amazing. Red pill now available at infowarsstore.com and your purchase
[32:57.620 --> 33:17.300]  funds the operation. You're listening to the Alex Jones show defending the republic from
[33:17.300 --> 33:26.460]  enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones. All right, we've reached an extremely dangerous
[33:26.460 --> 33:32.380]  juncture right now, the globalist program to block the American reboot and the attempt
[33:32.380 --> 33:38.540]  to simply get our sovereignty back into the United States and to get our own country under
[33:38.540 --> 33:46.300]  control of the people again. That has them pulling out all the stops, but every one of
[33:46.300 --> 33:51.820]  their operations is failing right now. So they are going to full weaponization where
[33:51.820 --> 33:58.860]  every comedy show, every major TV show, every news show, every newspaper is basically saying,
[33:58.860 --> 34:05.460]  let's get violent. Let's attack Trump supporters. Let's attack Trump. Let's have a civil war.
[34:05.460 --> 34:11.340]  And they just hope they can foam in enough violence, enough intimidation and enough bullying
[34:11.340 --> 34:16.420]  to make the American people roll over to their demands. And it's very sad to see the very
[34:16.420 --> 34:22.140]  weak minded people, even as the economy comes back and good things happen, they really believe
[34:22.140 --> 34:27.380]  that the American people and Trump are physically hurting them. So they're going out and physically
[34:27.380 --> 34:33.220]  attacking their bullying, Scarborough again, the clips coming up has come out and said
[34:33.220 --> 34:40.900]  that Trump is so horrible that he's going to cause violence in America to erupt while
[34:40.900 --> 34:46.380]  the former attorney general calls for people to hit the streets to remove Trump. And while
[34:46.380 --> 34:49.980]  they run full page ads in the New York times and we say, Hey, you're fomenting all this.
[34:49.980 --> 34:55.300]  They go, No, we're not. You're crazy. Scarborough slams Fox News for fomenting a constitutional
[34:55.300 --> 35:01.220]  crisis could lead to violence because Fox News is daring to have congressmen on with
[35:01.220 --> 35:08.100]  the emails and the text messages and the FBI files where they met with a deputy director
[35:08.100 --> 35:13.780]  on how to keep Trump out of office and how to create an insurance policy, a made up dossier
[35:13.780 --> 35:21.420]  to push the fake Russian narrative. We have caught them in a gigantic arrogant foaming
[35:21.420 --> 35:39.100]  at the mouth, arrogance, fueled rabid dog, reckless naked, bold, ridiculous fraud run
[35:39.100 --> 35:46.180]  by it looks like maybe 15 people in the justice department in the FBI. And that really makes
[35:46.180 --> 35:50.780]  me feel good to know that for all the problems in our government, they tried to keep it down
[35:50.780 --> 35:54.540]  to like 15 people knowing that it would leak and they'd get in trouble, which of course
[35:54.540 --> 35:59.580]  it did leak. And people are going to start covering their butts now because they don't
[35:59.580 --> 36:03.900]  all want to go to prison. And I don't know how the Clintons and their operatives in the
[36:03.900 --> 36:08.820]  FBI get away with this. I don't know how Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch or James Comey
[36:08.820 --> 36:14.300]  or Eric Holder, I don't see how Strock gets away with this. And there's only a couple
[36:14.300 --> 36:20.140]  others, the Justice Department official, his wife at Fusion GPS. I don't see how they put
[36:20.140 --> 36:26.100]  Humpty Dumpty back together again. And that's the issue. They're now at the full cornered
[36:26.100 --> 36:33.100]  hyena point. And we're moving in for the political final blow. And they're going to hit us with
[36:33.100 --> 36:38.420]  whatever else they got. I think they're going to go ahead and make their move to kill the
[36:38.420 --> 36:39.420]  Clintons.
[36:39.420 --> 36:43.820]  I think in the next 30 days, I think they're going to make an assassination attempt. I just
[36:43.820 --> 36:47.580]  my gut, I see all of them together. They're that desperate. They're either going to give
[36:47.580 --> 36:52.900]  up or they're going to activate their cells. And a lot of my smart sources agree with that.
[36:52.900 --> 36:57.460]  And they've got a lot of mentally ill Democrats and people inside the Secret Service, inside
[36:57.460 --> 37:03.700]  other places in government. And, you know, whenever the Clintons and then the Obamas
[37:03.700 --> 37:09.140]  would go into military areas, they'd have everybody take the clips, the magazines, the
[37:09.140 --> 37:12.620]  ammunition out of their firearms.
[37:12.620 --> 37:19.500]  Trump isn't doing that. They're not taking the ammunition out. And I just, I don't think
[37:19.500 --> 37:22.900]  they should. And the president, if he's going to get killed, he's ready to get killed. And
[37:22.900 --> 37:25.500]  that's just where this is going to go next. And it's going to be like when they killed
[37:25.500 --> 37:28.420]  Julius Caesar, you know, what happened to the plotters. I mean, they really brought down
[37:28.420 --> 37:31.980]  hell on them then. I mean, if we, I mean, I don't want the president to be killed. But
[37:31.980 --> 37:37.940]  if they are dumb enough to actually do it, boy, they have sealed their warrant of death.
[37:37.940 --> 37:46.060]  I mean, they have guaranteed they are all going to probably never even see court. So
[37:46.060 --> 37:50.300]  they're playing chicken with people that are ready to mash down the accelerator. Because
[37:50.300 --> 37:54.300]  I know I'm mashing it down. I'm pointing my car right at the nose of theirs. So is Trump.
[37:54.300 --> 37:59.420]  That's the spirit. Just you awaken the sleeping giant, pedal to the metal. Only thing that
[37:59.420 --> 38:04.980]  feels good is to not, not turn. We're not going to turn. We're not going to back down.
[38:04.980 --> 38:08.820]  We're not going to give up. We're going to break your will. We are going to break your
[38:08.820 --> 38:13.020]  will. And if you want to press down the accelerator or want to go right into us, that means we
[38:13.020 --> 38:17.020]  guarantee that your defeat, because we're doing this for everybody else. We're not Satan
[38:17.020 --> 38:22.300]  worshipers like you only care about themselves. We're going to get you. We're going to come
[38:22.300 --> 38:27.740]  for you. We're never going to stop. You're going to be absolutely destroyed. So you
[38:27.740 --> 38:33.300]  don't want to fight. You better believe you got one. And listen, Trump's not perfect.
[38:33.300 --> 38:36.820]  His administration's full of globalists. That's where he's, I mean, you can only draw from
[38:36.820 --> 38:40.900]  the swamp at this point. He's gotten a lot done, but he's restoring the power to the
[38:40.900 --> 38:46.180]  Republic, to the Congress, to the presidency, to the States, to the people. That's happening.
[38:46.180 --> 38:52.020]  The globalist takeover of America is almost at its tentacles completely cut off. That's
[38:52.020 --> 38:55.900]  why their money's drying up. It's why they're flipping out. It's why they got Phil Mudd
[38:55.900 --> 39:00.220]  on TV saying we're going to kill the president. Former deputy director of the CIA is a confidence
[39:00.220 --> 39:07.300]  game to act powerful to the entire world. And now everything I've told you about the
[39:07.300 --> 39:12.140]  criminality, about the network, about the fake dossier, it's all former deputy directors
[39:12.140 --> 39:16.440]  telling you it's a fraud, Congress people, and we have the documents. We have the real
[39:16.440 --> 39:21.300]  smoking gun documents that they don't have on the other side on Russia on selling us
[39:21.300 --> 39:28.740]  out on making up a fake dossier on what they haven't said yet is they paid two million
[39:28.740 --> 39:38.260]  diffusion GPS and she got the main contract, the wife of the guy that called for the funding.
[39:38.260 --> 39:40.980]  And of course, the Washington Post gets it. Did the Trump cabinet picks want to run the
[39:40.980 --> 39:48.140]  government or dismantle it? No, you got it. We're dismantling it. We told you it's too
[39:48.140 --> 39:53.540]  big. It's out of control. Get off our back. You put all this on us and bragged it was
[39:53.540 --> 39:58.900]  so we couldn't compete with anybody. It was a saboteur operation against the Republic.
[39:58.900 --> 40:03.100]  There are powerful elites that aren't devil worshipers. They're not perfect, by the way,
[40:03.100 --> 40:07.180]  who don't have it out for America or Western civilization and they want to build something
[40:07.180 --> 40:12.860]  good. Doesn't mean we won't slit your throat in a minute. You try to stop us. Doesn't mean
[40:12.860 --> 40:19.220]  you scumbags take our kindness for weakness and you're going to find out that's not how
[40:19.220 --> 40:26.180]  the cow ate the cabbage. You want a fight. You have got one. You want a fight. You've
[40:26.180 --> 40:34.020]  got one. You want one. You got one. You want one. You got one. I love being alive. I don't
[40:34.020 --> 40:37.500]  like the persecution, the dirty tricks that I've done to my family, but you know what?
[40:37.500 --> 40:42.660]  My family doesn't have any future if we don't beat you. You understand that? So I'm all
[40:42.660 --> 40:46.660]  in and once people are all in about this thing and don't care about how they get bullied
[40:46.660 --> 40:50.500]  online or what their neighbors say to them, stand up for what you believe in. Speak up.
[40:50.500 --> 40:54.020]  Don't be bullied and we're going to win. By the way, one big way to stand up is financial

[45:59.340 --> 46:02.820]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why
[46:02.820 --> 46:07.500]  is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much
[46:07.500 --> 46:12.900]  scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and
[46:12.900 --> 46:18.420]  water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[46:18.420 --> 46:23.020]  which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now
[46:23.020 --> 46:29.220]  with all the refugees spreading disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[46:29.220 --> 46:32.140]  These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that's in it. There's so many things
[46:32.140 --> 46:36.300]  that are in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic
[46:36.300 --> 46:41.140]  wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right. Well, I'm
[46:41.140 --> 46:44.860]  glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday.
[46:44.860 --> 46:48.740]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great
[46:48.740 --> 46:54.300]  for your body, period. And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr.
[46:54.300 --> 46:57.420]  Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this
[46:57.420 --> 47:03.420]  great product.
[47:03.420 --> 47:28.540]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. So if you are a regular listener, you know that
[47:28.540 --> 47:39.460]  I have exposed from their own websites, their own plans, the stated, admitted goals of Soros,
[47:39.460 --> 47:43.660]  the deep state, the Democrats in their own publications saying we're going to cause a
[47:43.660 --> 47:48.300]  constitutional crisis. We're going to bring all this Mueller stuff up and then claim that
[47:48.300 --> 47:52.500]  Trump's trying to block it. Then we're going to have riots. Then we're going to activate
[47:52.500 --> 47:55.940]  the Black Lives Matter. Then we're going to have Republicans start getting shot and killed
[47:55.940 --> 48:01.020]  at their homes, public places. I mean, you see it happening. Then we're going to kill
[48:01.020 --> 48:06.300]  the president. And they do that. They even have Phil Mudd go on air and say the government's
[48:06.300 --> 48:12.100]  going to kill Trump to look powerful to their other criminal networks to say, hey, hold
[48:12.100 --> 48:17.780]  fast. We're strong. He's dead. What all those folks need to do that have been approached
[48:17.780 --> 48:24.620]  about the coup is to go to the patriot media, go to the president, do your own YouTube's
[48:24.620 --> 48:28.740]  because then it'll get big and the people around Trump won't be able to block him from
[48:28.740 --> 48:34.260]  getting it. Here's an example in Bloomberg. Washington bureaucrats are quietly working
[48:34.260 --> 48:39.700]  to undermine Trump's agenda. That's called mutiny. Well, they said Obama said earlier
[48:39.700 --> 48:44.820]  this year, he said, don't worry, we've been spying on Trump and don't worry, we've put
[48:44.820 --> 48:49.540]  people into all the positions so they won't let him hire anybody under him. We'll just
[48:49.540 --> 48:54.540]  fire those people and they'll lie right to the president's face. Just like McCabe said
[48:54.540 --> 48:59.460]  sir, I'm loyal. I'll follow the Constitution. I'm not a Clinton operative. Okay, McCabe,
[48:59.460 --> 49:05.660]  you're a nominee. And then McCabe is the ring leader in the emails and text messages creating
[49:05.660 --> 49:12.980]  the fraud of the fusion GPS. Now you understand what the president is up against just like
[49:12.980 --> 49:18.460]  we are. He's just a beachhead. He gives the orders and they've ignored 90% of them, but
[49:18.460 --> 49:25.260]  still the economy's coming back because we were so tied down by these little opiations.
[49:25.260 --> 49:31.460]  And again, they've said in Atlantic monthly, in the New Yorker, in the financial times,
[49:31.460 --> 49:36.100]  in the last year, hundreds of times, how they want a civil emergency, how they're going
[49:36.100 --> 49:40.420]  to call it an emergency that's his fault, how they're going to activate riots and say,
[49:40.420 --> 49:46.500]  oh, the economy plunged, it's his fault. They're ready to cause a depression. We're on the
[49:46.500 --> 49:52.980]  edge. That's why we've got to expose what they're doing. That's what we've got to expose
[49:52.980 --> 49:58.340]  their plan. And now word for word, when I told you they were planning to do with this
[49:58.340 --> 50:06.700]  soft coup that's going high, Scarborough comes out who's the mouthpiece of these people and
[50:06.700 --> 50:10.860]  says it all this morning, laced with baloney when they're the ones causing the crisis,
[50:10.860 --> 50:13.660]  when they're the ones that stole the nomination from Sanders, when they're the ones that tried
[50:13.660 --> 50:19.860]  to block Trump being seated, when they're the ones that created the frauds.
[50:19.860 --> 50:28.060]  And now we learn, I already knew this, but that Trump had hired different private contractor
[50:28.060 --> 50:33.780]  groups that were known to be loyal to the country who weren't globalist. Eric Prince
[50:33.780 --> 50:42.820]  and some other groups out of Florida, private contractor groups, to protect him during the
[50:42.820 --> 50:46.700]  campaign, during the time that he was in transition, and they've tried to, the Secret Service
[50:46.700 --> 50:50.540]  tried to get rid of them, but some of those groups are still there, and they've told
[50:50.540 --> 50:55.420]  the president, it now came out in Politico and the Intercept, word for what I said.
[50:55.420 --> 50:59.500]  There's a rogue group in CIA and FBI. They're planning your overthrow. We're trying to stop
[50:59.500 --> 51:04.620]  them. They've been counter-surveying them, but only surveilling very legal surveillance
[51:04.620 --> 51:12.740]  on the president, only doing it at point-baked range in the streets, only with human intelligence,
[51:12.740 --> 51:15.300]  on the ground, watching what's going on.
[51:15.300 --> 51:21.700]  I mean, this is a civil war, folks. We're taking the country back. In fact, it's beyond a civil
[51:21.700 --> 51:26.740]  war because we're the Americans. Doesn't mean we're perfect. Private lives, intelligence
[51:26.740 --> 51:31.180]  agencies, citizens in government, corporate people, you name it, who aren't traders who
[51:31.180 --> 51:34.980]  just want the country back. That's all we want is our country back run by the people.
[51:34.980 --> 51:40.460]  And we want classic Americana prosperity, not globalism. And so we're being demonized.
[51:40.460 --> 51:47.900]  We're under attack. And the bureaucrats are just in a mutinous fashion ignoring everything.
[51:47.900 --> 51:52.700]  But they can't hold on much longer. It's been a year. And they're getting scared and they've
[51:52.700 --> 51:56.340]  been caught in their early fraud. They were arrogant. They thought he'd never win. They
[51:56.340 --> 52:01.460]  set this fraud up thinking it was an insurance policy. Then the arrogance went to fear as
[52:01.460 --> 52:05.700]  they knew they were all going to go to prison. And Trump reached out early on and said, just
[52:05.700 --> 52:08.940]  stop it. Let's move forward with the country. I'll leave you alone.
[52:08.940 --> 52:14.220]  I told the president, I said, sir, that is a mistake. You must go after them. Now they
[52:14.220 --> 52:20.940]  are going to do X, Y, Z. And the media goes, why does Trump keep listening to info wars?
[52:20.940 --> 52:25.060]  He says it and then Trump says it a week later, because I'm right. I'm right over and over
[52:25.060 --> 52:31.340]  and over again because I live this. I'm not a lazy blob. Like, like Phil Mudd that goes
[52:31.340 --> 52:38.620]  on TV and goes, we'll just kill the president. And then that's all he's got is his bravada.
[52:38.620 --> 52:42.700]  You're watching you scum. We know about your plan more than you do. You just keep rolling
[52:42.700 --> 52:46.580]  the dice, hoping you're going to win. This has all been war game throughout history.
[52:46.580 --> 52:51.500]  It's been war game here. You'll never get away with killing the president. You'll interview
[52:51.500 --> 52:58.420]  dead. It you will be destroyed. I haven't gotten to the Scarborough and Roger Stone
[52:58.420 --> 53:02.340]  is here with big, exclusive stuff, but we're going to play the Scarborough when he's on
[53:02.340 --> 53:07.260]  with us. It's up on info wars.com, but it's here. But notice I'd say they're planning
[53:07.260 --> 53:10.220]  to cause a civil emergency and they're planning to call for COG and they're going to call
[53:10.220 --> 53:14.180]  it a national emergency and a national crisis that the president is the crisis. They're
[53:14.180 --> 53:17.340]  trying to declare the 25th amendment. They're going to say he's mentally ill and brain damage.
[53:17.340 --> 53:25.780]  They're going to do it because we have moles. We have moles inside who aren't out to get
[53:25.780 --> 53:29.580]  the country who act like their liberals and sit there at the New York Times and the Washington
[53:29.580 --> 53:35.340]  Post in these meetings where they go, the public's not buying it. It's all fraud and Hillary
[53:35.340 --> 53:39.660]  and Obama are totally in bed with the Chinese and the Russians and everybody else and what
[53:39.660 --> 53:42.700]  are we going to do? We get caught. They're like, don't worry. Next, we'll say he has
[53:42.700 --> 53:46.940]  Alzheimer's or they're just going to kill him. You're like, really? They're like, don't
[53:46.940 --> 53:50.900]  worry. I've talked to the former director. They've got the teams ready. You know, I mean,
[53:50.900 --> 53:54.700]  if they're on TV saying they're going to kill the president, they're in these meetings,
[53:54.700 --> 53:58.660]  man, because they got to hype their people up. They're like, we're scared. We don't want
[53:58.660 --> 54:03.740]  to do this. The economy's coming back by 401ks up 40%. These conversations are happening
[54:03.740 --> 54:08.180]  and they're going, you shut up. You're part of it now. We're going to kill that orange-headed
[54:08.180 --> 54:17.820]  piece of crap. Now sit down and shut up and fill muds on TV. Trump is going to kill him.
[54:17.820 --> 54:20.460]  You're just saying that because you're getting your ass kicked. You want American piece of
[54:20.460 --> 54:27.020]  trash, you big fat parasite garbage. Again, scum, you want to fight. You're just go ahead
[54:27.020 --> 54:35.220]  and try to kill the president. Go ahead. Let's go. You want to fight? None of you will ever
[54:35.220 --> 54:40.340]  get away with this, you idiots. It's not Scarborough. Oh, I know he's got away with other stuff.
[54:40.340 --> 54:44.540]  So like any other piece of garbage, he thinks he'll get away with this. You're not getting
[54:44.540 --> 54:50.380]  away with nothing. And here's a little secret about me. I'm not trying to get out of this
[54:50.380 --> 54:58.140]  myself. You understand? I want to see you burn in hell. I understand that filth. I'm not
[54:58.140 --> 55:03.940]  a devil worshipper, narcissistic, coward, scum like you. I want to see you defeated. You
[55:03.940 --> 55:08.940]  understand? All of us have to have that attitude where we're not scared of anything and we
[55:08.940 --> 55:19.700]  are committed and we are not stopping and that's it. That's it. You understand? Now,
[55:19.700 --> 55:25.420]  they will strike back, but these sacks of crud are going down. We have them shipping
[55:25.420 --> 55:31.540]  the arms to Hezbollah, Obama. We have that Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel coming on
[55:31.540 --> 55:38.580]  that broke it all here in March of last year. The White Wash is in the political today.
[55:38.580 --> 55:49.500]  The secret backstory of how Obama let Hezbollah off the hook. Off the hook for drug dealing,
[55:49.500 --> 55:55.620]  all over the world and in the U.S. to buy arms. And guess who they were buying the arms
[55:55.620 --> 56:02.340]  from? Fast and furious wasn't just shipping guns down to cause a Mexican civil war. They
[56:02.340 --> 56:11.340]  were shipping high impact anti-tank weapons. You name it, through Mexico, through those
[56:11.340 --> 56:18.060]  ports to the Middle East. And now, oh, I guess you want that to come out, Obama? It is. And
[56:18.060 --> 56:22.540]  to have a controlled demolition, you guys are releasing it through Politico to make
[56:22.540 --> 56:28.020]  it a White Wash. Oh, he let him off the hook. He didn't let him off the hook. He was in
[56:28.020 --> 56:35.140]  triple X sex with him. He was in Congress with him. He was in bed with Iran, in bed
[56:35.140 --> 56:43.460]  giving him the weapons. So get ready for all of that to come out. The Lieutenant Colonel
[56:43.460 --> 56:46.820]  that first broke it all, breaking fast and furious with secret partnership arms of Middle
[56:46.820 --> 56:54.820]  East terrorists, March 30th, last year, Adan Salazar. And now it's all coming on. This
[56:54.820 --> 57:06.060]  is the specific operation. This has all been ordered. The guns are shipped out. The drugs
[57:06.060 --> 57:14.540]  are shipped out. And then the Arab and Muslim networks sell the drugs and buy more guns.

[59:52.940 --> 01:00:08.180]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide.
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:21.140]  It's Alex Jones. Okay, my friends, we are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Monday,
[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:26.380]  18th day of December, 2017. Thank you so much for joining us. We've got an overload of people
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:30.460]  today. It's going to be amazing. Roger Stone and breaking news in studio next segment.
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:35.820]  We then have the Lieutenant Colonel from the Marine Corps on who first broke the fast inferences
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:39.940]  being directly run on a military basis, not just out of gun shops. That was the low level
[01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:45.460]  cover that was just a sting program gone bad. That was nothing. That was just retail part
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:49.620]  of an operation to blame gun owners. So they wanted some retail arms shipped into Mexico.
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:56.980]  It was US Army, US Marine Corps, heavy weapons, anti tank weapons, full auto machine guns,
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:03.740]  light machine guns, heavy machine guns, battle rifles. And then drugs were also given to
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:09.500]  Hezbollah. It's also ISIS to be brought back in and then to buy more guns. That was all
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:16.220]  Obama. It's in political today. We broke it over a year ago. So that is coming up as well.
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:22.580]  This is so bombshell and the entire FBI Clinton operation is now coming down. So Scarborough
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:28.980]  and the Democrats are now going directly to their day of rage that the Antifa groups that
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:32.580]  we broke yesterday called for. We told you yesterday the mainstream media will now call
[01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:37.420]  for rage in the streets. Holder has called for people to hit the streets. So a Scarborough
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:41.820]  claiming that Trump's going to fire Mueller, not even true. But again, we're going to let
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:47.140]  Mueller just fry out there in the wind as all of these emails come out about he and
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:51.060]  McCade fixing the whole thing. So that's coming up. But first, I want to play this
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:58.940]  special report here, or at least part of it. This is MSM covers it up while info wars
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:05.740]  breaks it. So here's part of a report. But John, we are able to force things out that
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:13.540]  the media is already sitting on. Remember Roger Stone and others broke here two and
[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:18.780]  a half months ago that McMaster was at a particular restaurant, a particular place and who he
[01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:24.980]  was with. And that he said, oh, I just got the phone with that idiot moron. All he can
[01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:28.820]  do is use Twitter. He's so stupid. I'm afraid he's going to blow the planet up and that
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:33.460]  McMaster was a slob and drunk. Now we knew the New York Post sat on that the New York
[01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:37.900]  Times sat on that. We were given it because they sat on it. And then two months later,
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:42.620]  two and a half months later, it broke. But two weeks ago, exactly as we said at the very
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:44.780]  restaurant, all of it confirmed.
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:56.380]  McMaster went to dinner with a CEO executive from Oracle, Safra Katz. Katz is widely admired
[01:02:56.380 --> 01:03:02.340]  in the business community and was being recruited as the possible chairman for the president's
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:07.420]  intelligence review board.
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:14.460]  McMaster became exceedingly inebriated, according to the report I have received. And during
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:20.260]  the dinner, took a phone call from the president, at least having the good sense to step away
[01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:28.100]  from the table. But when he returned, he went into a diet tribe about his boss. He described
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:35.340]  the president as a dope, said that he couldn't think beyond 140 characters, that he couldn't
[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:43.860]  understand any complex issues, and that the idea of Trump with his hands on the nuclear
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:47.020]  football was inappropriate or scary.
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:54.220]  He said, it's scary. And that his view is his job was to save Trump from blowing up
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:55.220]  the world.
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:04:01.540]  And McMaster, as I started out in April, he started purging anybody who was remotely
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:06.900]  America first, anybody who actually cared about America. He had said that we need to
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:12.300]  get rid of all of the Trump people and bring in Obama holdovers. And then he said, you
[01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:18.100]  can't even call people Obama holdovers. So right now, we are in a war for the future
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:23.540]  of our nation. And McMaster is the greatest national security threat facing America.
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:29.100]  That's our job is to not get the attention or even be praised for what we do. It's to
[01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:33.500]  force the media to cover it. That's our real power. Because before they could cover stuff
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:37.460]  up like that forever, they could cover up a Monica Lewinsky or Chinese missile secrets,
[01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:38.460]  you name it.
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:43.420]  If whistleblowers went public because there wasn't a drudgereport.com to put it up, like
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:47.740]  back with Monica Lewinsky. McMaster trashed Trump and private dinner. MSM break story
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:51.900]  in fours broke months ago. There's Dan Lyman's article from November 21st. You can scroll
[01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:56.780]  down into the article and actually click the original info. Wars broke the story report
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:05:04.140]  McMaster labeled top scientists and researchers agree. We are being hit by toxic weapons in
[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:11.140]  the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick and stupid. So what do we do
[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:16.500]  about it? Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it fight back with the all
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:24.260]  new supercharged Brain Force Plus and feel the rush without the crash. Brain Force Plus

[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:04.780]  Some of my colleagues at Trump Tower just a few minutes ago, there's a little optimism
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:08.380]  here. No one thought it was going to be this close at this point. Trump can still win this
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:11.300]  thing. We have another state to project it is the state of North Carolina, big battle
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:15.820]  for that state. It's going to Donald Trump. I was actually ready to go to bed. And then
[01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:20.460]  I started seeing the electoral college come in, like super psych. This is going to be
[01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:26.580]  a very close election. I'm seeing these late breaking trends. This could hand Trump the
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:31.980]  presidency folks. This is not by any means over. I think there's some real jitter setting
[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:37.860]  in Clinton headquarters right now. Wolf, the scene here is so different than it was a few
[01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:44.780]  hours ago when people were happy and relaxed. This is most unexpected. Certainly is a huge,
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:49.420]  huge surprise to so many people out there. I think we all thought it couldn't happen.
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:55.660]  It couldn't do what he did. And guess what? He may just do it. Donald Trump has taken
[01:06:55.660 --> 01:07:00.620]  the lead. He has 216 electoral votes. This is truly the beginning of the end for Hillary
[01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:07.780]  Clinton campaign. The number of groups who are likely feeling real fear right now.
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:12.300]  You've got women, immigrants who have been threatened by Donald Trump with deportation.
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:17.780]  How do I explain this to my children? I have Muslim friends who are texting me tonight
[01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:22.620]  saying, should I leave the country? America is crying tonight. I'm not sure how much
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:30.780]  of America, but a very, very significant portion. And I mean literally crying.
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:35.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide on your host, Alex Jones. And you're
[01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:42.780]  tuned in to Info Wars Live. Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign is here with us
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:48.180]  to cover so many big breaking stories. But obviously most of people's attention is turned
[01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:54.580]  towards the 76 people that have been transported to the hospital. No numbers yet on a debt.
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:59.020]  We hope, well, they're saying three debt after Amtrak trained the rails from bridge onto
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:05.620]  interstate five near Olympia. 70 plus transported people still hanging from the rail cars.
[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:13.060]  They crashed over a broken part of the bridge and went down into the interstate highway,
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:18.820]  crushing vehicles under it. And as I've said thousands of times, I've had family members
[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:23.460]  that have asked me to go on these trains, these scenic trains. And I said, not on US
[01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:28.860]  rail beds, never. They are amongst the worst in the world. Our infrastructure has been
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:38.740]  purposely for 50 years absolutely shut down. And this is just incredible to see this unfolding.
[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:44.340]  Multiple fatalities, scores injured after Amtrak train plunges off the bridge onto
[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:51.420]  I-5. So that is happening, obviously. We're about to have something really plunge off
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:56.260]  a bridge and that is the Democrats want to get days of rage, protest against Trump claiming
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:09:00.660]  that he's scuttled the Russia investigation and is about to fire Mueller and that he's
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:05.420]  simply exposing that it's a fraud and having the emails that it was a Democrat operation
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:09.540]  and based on a fraudulent dossier that the wife of the head of the Justice Department
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:16.620]  got paid to create. And all this collusion, they are saying that they want days of rage,
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:21.020]  that they want people in the streets, that they want all of this happening. Scarborough,
[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:26.460]  slams Fox News for fomenting a constitutional crisis could lead to violence. Meanwhile,
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:29.900]  Trump says he's not firing Mueller, but they just keep coming back over and over and over
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:32.740]  and over again saying, yes, you are, yes, you are. Now, Roger, early on, it said it's
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:36.420]  a fraudulent investigation. Presidents can do this, do it. But the last three months,
[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:40.700]  he's been saying, well, or two months, no, he should have a special counsel to expose
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:45.180]  Mueller. Well, now Congress is actually looking at that. So you've trailblazed there. But you've
[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:48.660]  told me this morning, now more than ever, Trump does not need to fire Mueller because
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:53.780]  the conspiracy has been exposed. I'm surprised they were arrogant enough to have FBI minutes,
[01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:58.900]  memos, emails, text messages with McCabe, who was deputy director at the time. This
[01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:01.540]  is simply incredible that they were this bold.
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:07.260]  Alex, it's really extraordinary. Mueller's public credibility continues to crumble. The
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:15.300]  emails, the campaign contributions, the interconnection of the rabid partisans who are working for
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:22.540]  him. And as his credibility continues to erode, the president's options, I think, continue
[01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:28.220]  to expand. Now, were the president to fire Mueller, you'd have the immediate analogy
[01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:34.100]  to the Saturday Night Massacre, Nixon's firing of special prosecutor in Watergate, Archibald
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:38.660]  Cox, and the left would get what they want.
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:44.300]  Firing Mueller is unnecessary. If Mueller has indicted Flynn, if he indicts the president's
[01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:50.460]  son-in-law on some phony obstruction of justice or perjury charge, the president has the option
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:56.420]  now of pardoning both of them. The president needs to ignore his lawyers when they tell
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:11:02.580]  him that he has no authority to direct the actions of the Justice Department. He does.
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:08.180]  The Justice Department is an extension of the executive branch. He can order Jeff Sessions.
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:15.860]  He can call him right now and say, I order you to appoint Andrew McCarthy or Andrew Napolitano
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:22.780]  or Trey Gowdy or Rudy Giuliani as the special counsel to look into Uranium One. And if Sessions
[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:28.860]  cannot do that or will not, he must step aside. There's nothing improper on that. And once
[01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:36.580]  Mueller and Comey and McCabe and Rod Rosenstein himself, who was the supervising U.S. Attorney
[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:41.100]  in Uranium One, are under investigation, they cannot go forward.
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:46.500]  And you've got Mueller killing Uranium One. I mean, these people literally are in a criminal
[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:53.260]  conspiracy. And it's not just me saying that now. It's all these Trey Gowdy, Jim Jordan,
[01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:54.260]  it's Bud...
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:12:00.380]  Matt Gaetz, Ron DeSantis. These guys are heroes. They have courageously gone where the established
[01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:04.220]  Republicans will not go. This whole idea...
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:09.380]  And they're freaking out. The Democrats are mad that this return America movement, return
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:13.820]  our sovereignty back to America movement, won't back down. They are naked crooks with
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:18.420]  fake dossiers openly saying, we're going to stop the president and remove him with
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:19.420]  made up crap.
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:24.980]  It's a frame up. It's a conspiracy. It's just like SJW is that get caught putting swastikas
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:29.940]  on their dorm rooms. You have been caught scum and they are freaking out. But I think
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:33.460]  we're at the maximum moment of danger here, Roger. You've got Scarborough and all their
[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:37.700]  talking points saying, we're just going to overthrow Trump. We're going to get violent.
[01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:41.700]  Hashtag hunt Republicans. So these bullies, just like we're some intern that gets our
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:46.340]  brains bashed out, I guess, these bullies just think that they're going to tell us to
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:47.340]  fill our hand.
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:51.260]  Well, it's a different wing of the same operation. You were the first one to call this. This
[01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:55.500]  is like the elites. That's Mueller and the lawyers and the insiders. And then they have
[01:12:55.500 --> 01:13:01.300]  their street fugs financed by Soros and others. So they intend to foment a revolution.
[01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:04.020]  And Eric Holder has said hit the streets. So it's all coordinated.
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:09.140]  Well, the problem is we're saying hit the streets. We're telling patriots, no, object,
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:14.060]  do not allow them to take our president down in a coup d'etat. Here are the facts. This
[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:20.340]  is a partisan hit squad. This is a coup d'etat. This is an illegitimate takedown of the president,
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:25.820]  not based on evidence and law, but based on animus and hatred and fear that he that he
[01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:31.700]  is challenging the administrative, the two party duopoly in the established order.
[01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:36.980]  You know, I have said last week that I think the course is clear, Alex. Mueller is going
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:44.140]  to indict the president in some phony process related charge, obstruction or perjury. His
[01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:49.180]  lawyers are walking him into that either out of naivete or because they're in on it.
[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:54.020]  And he needs to put the special counsel in now so that Mueller has to recuse himself to
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:58.740]  draw attention to the wrongdoings and give that a new focal point. But I say this out
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:00.900]  of loyalty and support.
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:05.980]  Jim Jordan now agrees with you. So you are the progenitor of the idea of the special counsel.
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:11.740]  Some are saying no, we need to let the inspector general do it. Why suddenly have we seen good
[01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:15.700]  moves by the inspector general and the releasing of these emails and things that show the criminal
[01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:16.700]  conspiracy?
[01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:22.180]  I think the inspector general is a good actor. I think he's doing his job. I think that the
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:27.980]  abuses are so glaring, the partisanship naked, so glared that that he's doing his job. And
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:31.980]  I mean, this is like Cuckoo Land, like Hitler sitting over the Nuremberg trial. I'm not
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:36.100]  just saying that. We have them saying we are frauds. We are liars. We're going to stop
[01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:40.100]  the president. We're Democrat operatives. They all help cover up Clinton crimes on the
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:45.540]  Russians. They are covering up by accusing Trump of their crimes at the same damn time.
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:49.820]  But let's recognize that the president's lawyers, first they told him he would have a letter
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:54.220]  clearing him from Mueller at Thanksgiving, and then it was Christmas.
[01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:56.700]  And now it's a new meeting. What about this new meeting coming up?
[01:14:56.700 --> 01:15:00.660]  And now it's February 1. I think that new meeting is going to be shocking to them. There will
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:08.500]  be no letters clearing the president. In fact, I think it is very likely that Jared Kushner
[01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:16.340]  will be indicted in regard to the Flynn matter once again for a perjury regarding underlying
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:20.940]  legal activities. Process, process because they don't have anything else. And that brings
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:26.220]  it one step closer to the president. Kushner's done nothing wrong. But now they're panicking
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:30.500]  because the fake investigation has been blown sky high. They're panicking. And now they're
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:35.500]  going to the final thing right at the streets. 25th Amendment. Exactly. That's that's plan
[01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:42.420]  B. Man, I've got a brag. We have called this with total precision. But I guess we've read
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:46.460]  hundreds of history books about two day ties in these operations. No, no, no, we're conspiracy
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:52.100]  theorists. Yeah, wait and see. Yeah, we'll be right back with the calls for fomenting
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:55.940]  revolution by the left. Then they're going to blame it on us. Stay with us.

[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:10.100]  the human microbiome. Not all probiotics are made the same. Fluorolife probiotics use a
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:14.940]  unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the
[01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:20.900]  intestines for maximum effect. This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics,
[01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:25.260]  so if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and
[01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:30.420]  your wallet. Fluorolife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion,
[01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:35.500]  regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism. Did you know that over 80% of your immune
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:40.660]  system is located in your gut? That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important
[01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:45.300]  for overall health. Fluorolife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance

[01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:37.060]  Coming up, Lieutenant Colonel Smith Mack will be joining us who exposed Obama shipping
[01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:43.340]  guns to Hezbollah and ISIS. Obama went ahead and shipped the next shipments and that really
[01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:48.340]  made the military angry. Lieutenant Colonel is going public while they're active duty.
[01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:54.940]  That is just wild. This is now in Politico. It's just huge. We've got to think about
[01:20:54.940 --> 01:21:00.260]  the folks. At least three dead. Now it's saying 80 something taken to the hospital on a supposedly
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:04.660]  a faster Amtrak train. I guess it goes like 80 miles an hour instead of 40. Of course,
[01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:09.740]  the Japanese have them going 250 and so do the Germans, but we don't update our railways.
[01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:15.180]  But we spend millions in taxpayer dollars subsidizing Amtrak. Billions. Billions. And
[01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:23.380]  so, yeah, new knives, fancy cars, but not a road. So there it crashes into I-5, killing
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:29.220]  a bunch of people on the ground. And I literally was just telling family recently, don't go
[01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:34.740]  on that scenic route. Don't get on an Amtrak. I mean, you're really putting your life in
[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:40.420]  your hands. It's not safe. It's not safe. They're blowing up and crashing all the time. Despite
[01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:46.140]  the fact that we've subsidized Amtrak and it continues to lose money hand over fist.
[01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:52.020]  We need new rail beds. We need private enterprise. I agree. Well, I come from a railroad type
[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:57.980]  family on one side. And I mean, they just grew up talking about this and all the rest
[01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:02.580]  of it. I mean, our railroads have fallen apart. Let's pray for the folks that are fighting
[01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:06.460]  for their lives right now. But they say it's safe and great to get on these. And I think
[01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:11.620]  it's insane. We also have just so much huge news. I want to get in the Scarborough article
[01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:15.180]  and I want you to ride shotgun with us here throughout the next interview that's coming
[01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:21.220]  up. But Roger, before we play the Scarborough piece, I mean, Plan A was keeping from getting
[01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:24.460]  the nomination and then trying to keep it from being seen as president. Now they try
[01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:28.060]  to sabotage the agenda. Now they try to have the fake Mueller. That's blown up. So now they're
[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:33.540]  going right to the final piece that was rioting on the street and violence and calling for
[01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:38.540]  the 25th Amendment to take place, which you first exposed, you know, I think if Mueller
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:43.700]  shoots and misses, which is now growingly probable because he is so exposed, he's so
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:49.980]  naked in terms of his partisanship and the rabid nature of the takedown plan, then the
[01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:56.300]  establishment will move to Plan B, which is a 25th Amendment takedown based on the fact
[01:22:56.300 --> 01:23:01.700]  that the president is allegedly non-compassmentist. He's nuts. He's crazy. I've talked to him.
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:07.740]  He's sharp as a tack. He's exactly the same as he was 40 years ago. So I see no deterioration
[01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:08.740]  whatsoever.
[01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:16.060]  But you see Joe Scarborough, Don Lemon, Senator Robert Corker and others, the misfit Keith
[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:21.500]  Oberman with this meme. He's nuts. He's crazy. He's around. But you're now willing to not
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:24.780]  give sources back at the first time you said this eight months ago. You said we're not
[01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:28.740]  going to give sources. You said when the female stuff fails, when the Russian fails, they're
[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:33.420]  going to say he's mentally ill early onset. And you talked to major writers at major papers
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:36.660]  who've been in the editorial meetings where they talk about just like Veritas caught it
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:40.380]  on tape, the whole Russian things bull. What are we going to do? People aren't buying it.
[01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:45.300]  They say, don't worry, 25th Amendment, we're going to say he's mentally ill and has Alzheimer's.
[01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:47.500]  You have that from sources. You didn't just imagine that.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:52.940]  No. And look, I spoke to a Trump cabinet member this weekend and I asked them point blank.
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:57.620]  Has there been any discussion about possibly removing the president under the 25th Amendment?
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:04.900]  Has anybody spoken to about that? Poker faced. Just poker faced. That's how I knew that I
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:10.820]  was right. Now they're saying it. Well, we've tracked Senator Ben Sasse talking about it.
[01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:16.100]  We've talked Jeb Bush talking about it. We have talked, we know that Nick Ayers, a high
[01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:24.100]  level aide to Vice President Pence, got busted leaking anti-Trump Russia information. They
[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:30.940]  made Mark Lauder, the press secretary, take the fall, but it was Ayers. And we know now
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:36.900]  that Mike Pence did demure, according to Jennifer Jacobs of Bloomberg, in that episecond when
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:40.900]  the Billy Bush tape dropped and the Republican-
[01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:43.940]  He hung up on the president. And the Republican National Committee and
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:48.780]  rights previous were contemplating a move to remove Trump as the nominee and replace him
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:51.860]  with Pence. We have come within millimeters of not having
[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:56.100]  this American rebirth. And then people expect it to be perfect. He's totally surrounded.
[01:24:56.100 --> 01:25:00.020]  Here's Bloomberg admitting that all the major cabinet people basically lie to his face and
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:05.060]  are blocking everything he's trying to do. But just the little bit he's got through things
[01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:09.780]  are surging back. I mean, if they're able to deep-six the economy, it's on their chest.
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:15.540]  No question about it. Look, this is the downside of appointing a cabinet of establishment Republicans.
[01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:20.180]  This is the downside of not surrounding yourself with people who don't have your back. No, there's
[01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:25.540]  a few standouts. There's a few loyalists, Wilbur Ross at Commerce, Linda McMahon, and so on.
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:29.460]  But by and large, you have establishment quizlings, people.
[01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:33.940]  And Trump just thought, like in business, hey, if I bring you in and you have the expertise
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:38.820]  and I'm the executive, you're not going to hate America against its own prosperous and
[01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:43.420]  your own. Yes, they are ideologues that we're hired to begin with by the globalists because
[01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:49.580]  they hate America. They have an existential lust of defeated and mounted on the wall because
[01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:54.500]  they're little beta-cup garbage. Well, and one opens the door to another. So you hire
[01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:58.460]  Rex Tillerson and the next thing you know, Condoleezza Rice is running the place. And
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:03.100]  all your assistants- But it is good news that Habit Powell got jettisoned out the airlock.
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:09.140]  Yes, I think so. Clearly, she got caught leaking and they had to bounce her. But Masser will
[01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:14.700]  pace her with another globalist, with another council on foreign relations member. The president
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:19.780]  thought, and this isn't naive, that like in all times in Americans history, once we had
[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:23.460]  an election, America would unite. Everybody would support the president because we care
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:29.140]  about our country. He had, he just did not understand the deep-seated animus. We are
[01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:35.300]  living in such an incredible time that the FBI would meet on record Democrats on how
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:41.420]  to engage in fraud and admit it's a fraud. I mean, they are red-handed caught. And it's,
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:46.060]  it is a pity because as you know, the FBI has had in American history this great reputation
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:51.500]  for probity and honesty and impartiality. But this is not meant to denigrate the men
[01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:54.820]  and women at the lower levels of the FBI who are the average agent. They're just trying
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:27:00.780]  to do their job. But at the top, this, this is rotten to the core. It has become a politicized-
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:04.900]  It's become a Democratic Party whorehouse with a bunch of arrogant cucks that think they're
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:09.180]  God. Well, I would argue that it's become a globalist, a establishment whorehouse because
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:13.580]  guys like Miller do dirty work for the bushes in the Clinton and they sell out to all these
[01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:16.860]  offshore globalists in foreign countries. In fact, they're not Russian agents. They're
[01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:22.260]  not Chinese agents. They're not, they are pimping us out. They are selling us out. They are
[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:26.380]  sitting there as a clearinghouse selling out the country and look at it. Well, they have
[01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:32.780]  no ideology other than the ideology of greed and power and money and control and a disdain
[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:37.260]  for the little person and a disdain for open democracy. But they're not Republicans or
[01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:43.380]  Democrats. They're not left or right. They're just evil and greedy. This is about money
[01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:47.900]  and power. Roger Stone is our guest. Before I go to break, I want you to ride shotgun

[01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:21.500]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You re listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:28.660]  All right, we re monitoring the Amtrak derailment that s killed at least three people and now
[01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:37.060]  over 85 injured, crashing through the bridge and down into I-5 there in Washington State.
[01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:46.940]  This news broke this morning and Matt, one of the great producers, brought it to my attention
[01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:50.420]  and said, didn't you cover this back in March of last year, almost a year and a half ago
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:55.940]  or I guess a year and a half ago or more? The secret back story of how Obama let Hezbollah
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:34:02.580]  off the hook. That s not a politico. Let them deal cocaine. Let them buy arms. That s what
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:08.260]  I was told by talks. Plumlee, CIA whistleblower and so many others off record. So Adon Salazar
[01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:12.340]  wrote the article breaking fashion furious with secret program to ship arms to Middle
[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:18.220]  East terrorists, ISIS and Hezbollah. This is destabilized. That s what Obama wanted.
[01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:24.700]  Now we ve got Matt Smith-Mack who was retiring at the time, he s now retired, 20-year veteran
[01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:30.100]  USMC. I m not going to go over his whole background in any terrorism and everything he s done,
[01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:35.060]  but he retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Marine Corps. Again, he s been on Judge
[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:40.780]  Advocate Tribunal members and Chief of Staff and so he had a really great career there.
[01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:47.180]  He was physically attacked when he began to whistle below by folks from behind and so
[01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:51.380]  we ve had talks. Plumlee s left the country over all this. This is very serious, but now
[01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:56.500]  they re being forced to admit it. So this wasn t just fast and furious with some guns
[01:34:56.500 --> 01:35:00.940]  from some gun stores. That was just the cover and a lot of this was classified so Matt couldn
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:04.460]  t get into a lot of it, but he could say, hey, more shipments are about to happen under
[01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:09.220]  Obama. We need to stop it and here s the base they re coming out of. So he was exposing
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:14.820]  real treason. Well, sometimes these things take time. Here we are a year and a half later.
[01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:19.180]  Now Trump, the FBI s looking into it. So Matt, I know you can t get into a lot of details
[01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:24.700]  of it, but as much as you can here, obviously, recapping and this is right in the same area
[01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:29.660]  that you were talking about and dealing with and the accusations you made here on the broadcast
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:34.220]  in March of 2016. So Matt Smith, Matt, thanks for coming on.
[01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:40.980]  Hey, Mr. Jones, thank you very much and thank you for inviting me back on. Yeah, I tell
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:48.340]  you, it s timely and it s truthful as I had spoken your program before, you know, the
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:53.260]  fast and furious and I can give you some additional information from February or this year onwards
[01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:58.340]  that I ll get into, but you talk about, we knew weapons were going to the Middle East
[01:35:58.340 --> 01:36:03.500]  when some of these groups of kids, they used that in air quotes that ATF and those guys
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:10.140]  had utilized, several, more than three occasions ran weapons through Louisville, Arizona, down
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:14.940]  route to the Kupuca, Mexico, where, you know, these kids who were involved in this, they
[01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:20.140]  ll talk about meeting with U.S. government officials and people of Middle Eastern descent
[01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:26.700]  with the weapons going to the Middle East, you know, and about a month after that first
[01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:34.900]  shipment, you know, in about September of 2010 or so, you had the DSD commander, which
[01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:40.380]  liked their internal security in Morocco stating, you know, to his appearance that fast and
[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:45.940]  furious weapons were coming into the kingdom. So yes, fast and furious was what we know
[01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:50.780]  it to be, you know, weapons running south, U.S. government running south, weapons to
[01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:56.020]  a ton of little cartel and say for the brave people like, you know, then Sophalo and Jay
[01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:01.380]  Dobbin, John Dodson, who, you know, Alex, these were trusted, respected federal agents
[01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:07.900]  who speak the truth and then they have, they become into the state, which is this heartening
[01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:13.820]  and if I might, there was another board of patrol, board tag agent named William Meale
[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:20.620]  Anderson. He died of suspect causes in February of this year. He was one of the body, one
[01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:25.660]  of the people who carried Brian Terry's body out of Peck Canyon, right? And we know from
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:30.860]  the medical examiner's report that Brian Terry, from the moment when he shot, when he's on
[01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:37.060]  the medical examiner's table, Alex, was only 90 minutes. Now, it's Arizona and it's December,
[01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:42.420]  but it's not the Antarctic. He had full rigor set in, right, into Brian Terry's body according
[01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:46.820]  to the report. With that, you fast forward a little bit, death of the memorial service
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:51.780]  for Ken, for Brian Terry, Meale, again, at this point, a board tag agent.
[01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:56.380]  And again, Matt, I'm going to have you back for a full hour sometime this week or soon
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:38:00.300]  because you can go over the whole story of people being killed for leaking this info,
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:05.580]  what all of you have gone through because it's beyond a James Bond movie or beyond,
[01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:12.380]  you know, some of the films we've seen about intrigue, but bottom line, you've got weapons,
[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:15.900]  weapons being shipped out, being sent to the Middle East, being sent to Hezbollah,
[01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:23.100]  being sent to ISIS. And we now know that Obama blocked the FBI, the ATF, the Border Patrol,
[01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:28.340]  and all these groups in this big, thick article just confirming the whole type of stuff with
[01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:35.100]  these different Middle Eastern based cells and that Obama knew this was going on and
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:39.700]  blocked investigators, even letting them deal the drugs on the ground here in the U.S.,
[01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:43.700]  sell the drugs here on the ground in the U.S. as part of a larger operation. So this just
[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:51.980]  confirms into the whole area, the outrageousness of this, this isn't just Obama, Roger Stone,
[01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:56.660]  turning a blind eye, that's how they're whitewashing it. This is confirming everything that the Colonel
[01:38:56.660 --> 01:39:00.740]  Smith-Mech has talked about, and he's trying to remember the men who blew the whistle who
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:04.380]  would end up getting dead and they'd find in their boots, you know, at home, hey, if
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:08.020]  I get killed, here's really the story. I mean, that's the whole incredible backside of this.
[01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:13.140]  Yet Joe Biden goes on CBS this morning last week and says, oh, eight years of Obama-Biden
[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:17.780]  and not a hint of scandal. Really, Mr. Vice President? What about this scandal? What about
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:23.620]  the lies and the perjury of Eric Holder, Eric Holder, the attorney general who oversaw
[01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:30.140]  this monstrosity? I mean, imagine shipping out of Marine Corps bases, huge truckloads
[01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:36.220]  of guns to kill Marines. Yeah, exactly. It's, it's outright, it's treasonous. And it's
[01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:41.180]  a massive scandal, which we only learned about now, not while Obama's in office. Well, Matt,
[01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:44.900]  I mean, I want to give you the floor the last few minutes we have, but please try to book
[01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:49.380]  out some time to come on via Skype or phone again. Later in the week, we salute your courage.
[01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:53.940]  You've been totally vindicated. This is whole other, even giant areas, not even related
[01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:57.980]  to what you broke, but also related to what you broke. It's just incredible how big this
[01:39:57.980 --> 01:40:01.540]  was. You were seeing one part of it. How big do you think this was?
[01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:06.940]  Sorry, you know, from, again, again, I didn't see this as a small part of it, but you could,
[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:11.540]  you could put the, you know, connect the dots. And I tell you when the telling part to me
[01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:17.620]  is when federal agents of, of character and courage, some, I got still alive, like the
[01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:22.340]  folks I mentioned, but also others like Brian Terry and William Neil Anderson, they speak
[01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:28.380]  up, they do the right thing and they wind up dead because they become a threat to whatever,
[01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:33.060]  whatever pathetic plan was put in place.
[01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:38.260]  Men of courage who stood on principle, they die. And again, the families are still demanding
[01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:43.500]  and asking for answers. And hopefully President Trump will, will honor the campaign pledge
[01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:48.740]  against the Terry family and help us to get answers on fast and furious as, as we need
[01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:50.980]  to see now as part of a larger deep state.
[01:40:50.980 --> 01:40:56.180]  Well, he's trying. He is completely surrounded. They admit he is. They're now moving to kill
[01:40:56.180 --> 01:41:00.680]  him. That's the word publicly and privately. And they're calling for the civil insurrection
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:05.020]  to begin on mainstream news and to try to stop the restoration of the Republic. We're
[01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:09.900]  in a literal fight to, to restore the Republic from multinational interests that have seized
[01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:10.900]  the nation.
[01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:15.060]  I had a senior Democrat operative walk up to me on the street, somebody I've known for
[01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:20.540]  30 years, a very serious person. And he said to me, well, Roger, who will assassinate the
[01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:25.580]  president first? Will it be a foreign power or will we do it? That's the mentality in
[01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:31.260]  Washington right now. The president's engraved danger. There is a multi-level coup d'etat
[01:41:31.260 --> 01:41:32.260]  in the works.
[01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:35.860]  And, and, and there's this arrogance to talk about it by all these scumbags because they
[01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:39.260]  think that they're going to get away with it.
[01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:42.940]  That Rosenstein performance before the House Intelligence Committee was the most incredible
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:48.060]  tap dancing I have ever seen. This guy can't see the nose on the end of his face. It is
[01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:52.820]  so clear that Mueller is in the tank and that this is a get Trump hit squad.
[01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:58.300]  All right, Matt Smith, Mech retired Lieutenant Colonel. We appreciate your courage. Please
[01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:01.660]  come on later in the week for a full hour and we'll get you on Skype. We've got a good
[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:03.140]  clear connection. Can you do that?
[01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:05.140]  Yes, sir. You bet. Yeah, you're convenient.
[01:42:05.140 --> 01:42:10.580]  Thank you. No, whenever you can. Thank you, sir. And again, the whole story is just incredible
[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:13.980]  of the people that people keep saying, oh, these feds are corrupt. When they try to not
[01:42:13.980 --> 01:42:15.980]  be corrupt, they get killed.
[01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:23.380]  And this is Obama literally funding the radical Muslims using our money, our weapons. And he
[01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:29.300]  didn't just do it destabilize. He was a jihadi. He is a globalist. These people are sick and
[01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:34.020]  busted. Well, that's another thing. I mean, imagine what else is going to come out. We're
[01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:40.740]  going to come back and get to Scarborough and others basically calling for civil war
[01:42:40.740 --> 01:42:44.940]  in America claiming we're calling for it with Roger Stone, by the way, Roger Stone just
[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:49.620]  won the big defamation case that they ran against him, the Democratic Party funded. He's got
[01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:57.500]  Obama suing him as well. So we'll be back.
[01:42:57.500 --> 01:43:03.500]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars, biome defense

[01:46:56.900 --> 01:47:15.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:41.380]  Roger Stone is our guest. This all ties together.
[01:47:41.380 --> 01:47:48.500]  Trump is not firing Mueller. Mueller is in trouble. His whole fraud is disintegrating.
[01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:55.220]  So now they're going to say oh he is firing Mueller so they can create all this anger and
[01:47:55.220 --> 01:48:02.260]  consternation act like oh look he's guilty and they're hoping that story clouds the hearings
[01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:10.900]  where we've now learned the truth about the Russia collusion story being a manufactured hoax.
[01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:15.540]  This is confirmed in the emails the text messages with the current FBI director.
[01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:21.060]  Well that's a great example of how Trump's got bad people advising him that that's who
[01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:27.060]  the Justice Department put in to replace Corrupt Comey. Oh you're getting rid of Corrupt Comey.
[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:32.100]  Here's the guy the ringleader of Russiagate confirmed he'll be your new FBI head.
[01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:37.620]  Yeah no it's extraordinary. Notice where this story came from. Trump is going to fire Mueller.
[01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:44.900]  The person puts that out is Congresswoman Jackie Spire. Spire rhymes with liar.
[01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:52.020]  This is this is a grand strategy of Adam Schiff the rabid left-wing congressman from California
[01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:56.820]  who doesn't want to end the Russian probe despite the fact that we've spent millions of hours
[01:48:56.820 --> 01:49:03.140]  and millions of dollars and come up with nothing. So we put Spire out there to whip up a hysteria.
[01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:08.500]  Oh Trump is about to fire Mueller. How would she know? How in the world would she know?
[01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:15.620]  I don't think the president has any intention of firing Mueller. Never interfere with your enemy
[01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:21.460]  when he's in the process of destroying himself. The guys shorts are showing. It's clear that this
[01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:28.340]  is a this is nothing but a rabid partisan takedown infected with hate. Trump by the way you just
[01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:35.620]  have you just want a big defamation case in New York. Yeah I was charged with defaming this
[01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:40.100]  gadfly sore loser candidate. Well let's not even get his name you know. No we don't need to.
[01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:46.900]  But it went to a Manhattan jury. Democratic timiny judge six Manhattan jurors all registered
[01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:54.180]  Democrats. George Soros's people financing the suit and the court found no cause. They dismissed
[01:49:54.180 --> 01:49:59.700]  the case in record time. And describe you told me on the phone that literal Soros lawyers came in
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:03.140]  and you said that they was like they were punched in the stomach when they lost. Well I had two
[01:50:03.140 --> 01:50:07.540]  co-defendants Carl Paladino who is the chairman of the Trump campaign in New York and a great
[01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:13.220]  patriot and Michael Caputo a longtime associate of mine. The judge dismissed the trial the case
[01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:18.980]  against both of them based on motion and then he let my charge go to the jury despite the fact that
[01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:24.340]  the charges against us were identical. Assuming that the jury would convict well the jury those fine
[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:29.380]  Americans were be able to look beyond the fact that they don't agree with me politically but I had
[01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:34.900]  no connection whatsoever to defaming this guy and there were multiple others who may have done so.
[01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:40.100]  The Soros lawyers who I believe financed this case and kept it alive. It looked like they'd
[01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:46.100]  been kicked in the stomach when the foreman of the jury handed the not guilty verdict to the judge.
[01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:51.620]  And they admit even in Politico that Obama's law firm and people he hired are suing you and the
[01:50:51.620 --> 01:50:57.860]  president in unprecedented case with no evidence for being Russian agents. What's extraordinary is
[01:50:57.860 --> 01:51:07.780]  that the the top line of the Obama NSA clapper Brennan the Islamic convert Hayden the guy who had
[01:51:07.780 --> 01:51:14.020]  the job under Bush have filed this extraordinary amicus brief in the case as have the top aides to
[01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:19.060]  John McCain. They say it's secret and we can't testify but the Russians did it. It's just it's
[01:51:19.060 --> 01:51:23.780]  just a regurgitation of their same old lie. They just believe if you keep saying it over and over
[01:51:23.780 --> 01:51:29.860]  again you don't need to produce evidence. We're the CIA. We're the NSA. Why would we lie? So they
[01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:36.500]  use their authority and their credibility because of their former titles but that they don't produce
[01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:42.260]  anything new. But I don't get to cross examine them. They can butt into this case and and make
[01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:46.900]  these false assertions but I'm not allowed to question them under oath. Seems unfair to me.
[01:51:47.780 --> 01:51:50.900]  All right when we go to break here in a few minutes we're going to have some surprise
[01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:55.940]  guests here in studio. I promised you guys some spectacular things here in the Christmas
[01:51:56.980 --> 01:52:01.700]  extravaganza that we'd have on Monday part of this 34-hour broadcast that runs through today
[01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:05.300]  through tomorrow with myself I was sure and a bunch of other special guests that will be here
[01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:10.580]  like Roger Stone in studio. I haven't even gotten the Scarborough stuff yet and I have
[01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:16.580]  Craig Sawyer a former member of and leader not not commander but leader in SEAL Team Six.
[01:52:16.580 --> 01:52:22.020]  He hates won't even talk about that. The point is he's a great guy and he's a host of top shots
[01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:28.180]  and all his shows on TV. They have gotten authorization from law enforcement to actually
[01:52:28.180 --> 01:52:33.380]  follow them on the raids rescuing children that have been kidnapped for sex slavery and he's
[01:52:33.380 --> 01:52:39.140]  seen all the big bust that are happening and behind the scenes you know I've been financing some of
[01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:42.580]  this but they've they've gotten the green light from law enforcement to show some of this
[01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:50.180]  exclusively here first coming up because what's been missing is when they bust the pedophiles
[01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:54.420]  then it all goes into court and gets shut down. News has got to be there when it first begins
[01:52:55.220 --> 01:52:59.860]  okay in the raid part kind of like a cop show but you're not busting winos and crack heads
[01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:03.700]  and you know hillbillies which is entertaining but it's you know not that important at the
[01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:08.340]  end of the day compared to pedophiles and they've they've got like a bad boys bad boys what's
[01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:12.820]  he going to do what's he going to do when they come for you but instead of helicopters coming in
[01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:19.460]  and so and other stuff and so this is taken off and you're going to get an exclusive first look
[01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:25.220]  at this coming up next hour Roger Stone will ride shotgun with us and then we've got some other

[02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:24.820]  really serious stuff let's recap people that just joined us before he breaks some new important news
[02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:30.100]  on the current ongoing plan to overthrow trump and then reverse the prosperity reverse the return
[02:07:30.100 --> 02:07:34.580]  of the republic this is one of the most important times roger undoubtedly in my view
[02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:38.260]  since the founding of the country what do you think uh look alex you and i had begun talking
[02:07:38.260 --> 02:07:45.140]  about the 25th amendment takedown of trump which is the establishment's plan b if they're uh if
[02:07:45.140 --> 02:07:52.500]  they're hitman miller shoots and loses uh and today they call us conspiracy theorists uh very
[02:07:52.500 --> 02:07:59.060]  shortly they will call us sages because this is going down there's an active operation in washington
[02:07:59.060 --> 02:08:04.660]  senator sass is involved senator corker is involved jeb bush is involved writes previs is
[02:08:04.660 --> 02:08:11.460]  involved uh at all levels of the party the uh mitch mcconnell has his fingerprints all over
[02:08:11.460 --> 02:08:17.060]  this and the way it works is simple they're going to ratchet up all of the trump is crazy he's crazy
[02:08:17.060 --> 02:08:22.820]  he's crazy i don't think kori luandowski helped this because of the way he depicts the president
[02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:27.220]  in his new book no i agree but it's obviously not going to work and so what do they do is
[02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:31.860]  that feels like everything else they've done well they don't yet know that it's not going to work
[02:08:31.860 --> 02:08:37.060]  and they're deeply uh committed to it but let people need to understand the background on joe
[02:08:37.060 --> 02:08:42.580]  scarborough matt gates who now has scarborough's seat in congress and worked for scarborough made
[02:08:42.580 --> 02:08:47.780]  it clear that joe talked about running for president every single day he was a congressman
[02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:53.380]  joe scarborough believes he should have been the republican nominee in 2016 joe scarborough believes
[02:08:53.380 --> 02:08:59.380]  that once trump was nominated the guy he should have picked for vice president was joe scarborough
[02:08:59.380 --> 02:09:05.620]  so he is deeply bitter and envious and jealous of the president now he used to brown notes the
[02:09:05.620 --> 02:09:11.140]  president used to hang out at marlago and take free trips on the president's plane to florida so he's
[02:09:11.140 --> 02:09:17.300]  a scorned he's a scorned woman exactly uh and this is all and the word is is scarborough attracted
[02:09:17.300 --> 02:09:24.340]  to trump uh i think scarborough has been attracted to women mostly the kind you pay for their services
[02:09:25.380 --> 02:09:29.220]  he is runs through an enormous amount of cash according to people around him
[02:09:30.100 --> 02:09:34.500]  he's a waste stroll but he's not going to be president and he's deeply jealous about the
[02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:43.300]  fact that donald trump is alexa who is joe scarborough charles joseph joe scarborough
[02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:51.620]  born april 1963 the american cable news host and former politician most people don't know

[02:09:58.100 --> 02:10:09.220]  leave congress sorry i don't know that alexa what was the name of the intern who had her brains

[02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:32.580]  communist party a communist party is a political party that advocates the application of the social

[02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:47.460]  what i found on wikipedia jesus also referred to as jesus of nazareth and jesus christ was a
[02:10:47.460 --> 02:10:52.100]  jewish preacher and religious leader who is the central figure of christianity christians
[02:10:52.100 --> 02:10:57.620]  believe him to be the son of god and the awaited messiah christ prophesied in the old testament
[02:10:58.180 --> 02:11:02.180]  that's funny alexa last week when i asked you told me he was a fictional character
[02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:08.580]  they've changed it busted let me ask her one more important question before we get to this
[02:11:08.580 --> 02:11:12.660]  descarborough news alexa
[02:11:16.100 --> 02:11:24.180]  what is the nazi party the national socialist german workers party abbreviated nsda p
[02:11:24.180 --> 02:11:30.260]  commonly known in english as the nazi party from the gaire pronunciation of nationales is elist
[02:11:30.260 --> 02:11:40.340]  the political party in germany between 1919 and 1945 notice she said socialists alexa
[02:11:41.780 --> 02:11:49.300]  who was adolf hitler adolf hitler was a german politician who was the leader of the nazi party
[02:11:49.300 --> 02:12:01.300]  chancellor of germany from 1933 to 1945 and furor of nazi germany from 1934 to 1945 now the last
[02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:04.900]  time we asked the questions she said he was bad and horrible but didn't say that about stallions
[02:12:04.900 --> 02:12:11.780]  so they've had to update this yeah well is alexa is uh national socialism an ideology of the left
[02:12:11.780 --> 02:12:20.020]  or the right sorry i don't know that it's it's a left-wing ideology believes in control of the
[02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:28.340]  state exactly alexa is socialism on the left or the right sorry i don't know that one
[02:12:30.660 --> 02:12:39.460]  alexa what is leftist ideology here's something i found on wikipedia broad left is a coalition
[02:12:39.460 --> 02:12:45.460]  of leftist members usually involving independents members of the labor party and members of organized
[02:12:45.460 --> 02:12:50.660]  revolutionary leftist movements within the trade union or members of a political party that appeals
[02:12:50.660 --> 02:12:57.060]  to a wide range of leftist ideologies such as left unity and that is the definition of communism
[02:12:57.060 --> 02:13:03.940]  right there yes indeed amazing simply amazing back to scarborough let's start playing some of this
[02:13:03.940 --> 02:13:10.260]  scarborough where now they're trying to overthrow the the president but and if we expose it's a fraud
[02:13:10.260 --> 02:13:17.540]  we're calling for violence what are the ones trying to foment it here it is through alabama
[02:13:17.540 --> 02:13:21.140]  you think they would have i i mean this you think they would have learned their lesson and said okay
[02:13:21.140 --> 02:13:27.460]  well we are really turning off younger voters we're really turning off women we're really turning
[02:13:27.460 --> 02:13:34.100]  off uh people who aren't just the most hardcore bannonite republicans and what do they do right
[02:13:34.100 --> 02:13:43.460]  after that they get state-run tv and republicans going out saying fire bob moeller something that
[02:13:43.460 --> 02:13:52.420]  the old it's state-run tv now to have c-span hearings and meanwhile trump's saying don't
[02:13:52.420 --> 02:13:58.660]  fire moeller it's the same line it's just all lies yeah in fact uh even the fiercest critics of
[02:13:58.660 --> 02:14:02.820]  moller in the congress have not called for him to be fired they've been called on him to be reigned
[02:14:02.820 --> 02:14:08.020]  in and they've called for the appointment of a special prosecutor on uranium one i was about to
[02:14:08.020 --> 02:14:14.660]  say you you can't just give hillary a pass on this and you just can't have when they're all
[02:14:14.660 --> 02:14:18.420]  caught colluding and it's a fake investigation somebody's got to go to jail well wait a minute
[02:14:18.420 --> 02:14:22.740]  we had we had a lot of trouble getting hillary's emails but moeller had no problem getting donald
[02:14:22.740 --> 02:14:29.220]  trump's like that is it i is it ironic that the guy at nsa who pardon me at gsa who refused to
[02:14:29.220 --> 02:14:34.660]  hand over all the records the trump campaign to moeller suddenly dies and then moeller gets them

[02:22:34.820 --> 02:22:41.940]  wives and husbands worked getting money from the fbi to create the fraud you've now learned
[02:22:41.940 --> 02:22:47.140]  of multiple individuals that worked at fusion gps that then also had family in the fbi just
[02:22:47.140 --> 02:22:51.380]  department and they're in the emails and text messages saying we're gonna set trump up we're
[02:22:51.380 --> 02:22:58.100]  gonna make this up we got to stop them and of course it's known that that is all completely
[02:22:58.100 --> 02:23:02.260]  made up but that's what they use to get the fake warrants and just all the rest of it it's it's
[02:23:02.260 --> 02:23:13.380]  simply incredible and then the media spins all of this like trump hates the fbi no trump hates

[02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:27.380]  and how they've had a political reign of terror prosecuting conservatives libertarians christian
[02:23:27.380 --> 02:23:34.500]  groups removing 501c3 standing having the irs harass people i mean it has been deniesha susan
[02:23:34.500 --> 02:23:42.340]  going to prison for doing nothing one one trillionth of what hillary's done this political
[02:23:42.900 --> 02:23:47.220]  reign of terror we've been witnessing that looks like something you'd have in communist china
[02:23:47.220 --> 02:23:53.220]  or nazi germany or socialist venezuela today this is banana republic garbage
[02:23:53.220 --> 02:24:01.380]  and i don't see how they're gonna get out of this now because more documents are coming out as as
[02:24:01.380 --> 02:24:06.260]  the fbi goes under contempt of congress and trump is basically ordering them to release it
[02:24:07.140 --> 02:24:12.980]  rozenstein's in deep trouble he's a clinton operative and you've got mccabe the ringleader
[02:24:12.980 --> 02:24:18.580]  we now learn when he was deputy director now acting director think of the bad advice trump
[02:24:18.580 --> 02:24:24.420]  got and he didn't know he got advised oh this is a good guy sir and he is the ringleader
[02:24:24.420 --> 02:24:30.020]  in the text messages in the emails and in the notes of the meetings where they're like we gotta
[02:24:30.020 --> 02:24:34.260]  bring candidate trump down he's like well i don't think he's gonna get elected but i i i agree with
[02:24:34.260 --> 02:24:42.260]  you well we got a set up an insurance policy i mean wow and then rozenstein's involved in
[02:24:42.260 --> 02:24:48.660]  uranium one so is mueller i mean these people need to be arrested on espionage charges and i've been
[02:24:48.660 --> 02:24:52.980]  saying this for a long time it's why they got so scared of trump getting in and went with the russian
[02:24:52.980 --> 02:25:00.180]  narrative because every one of these individuals is up to their eyeballs in russian money they're
[02:25:00.180 --> 02:25:07.220]  all part of these law firms to get the waivers when clinton was in so they could do these these
[02:25:07.220 --> 02:25:11.940]  deals and be on the boards of companies where they don't even invest money and then they get huge
[02:25:11.940 --> 02:25:16.260]  dividends other people have to invest five million ten million and one of the companies
[02:25:16.260 --> 02:25:20.260]  mueller's involved in mueller made no investment and gets money from it oh we're just gonna put
[02:25:20.260 --> 02:25:24.820]  you on the company you don't do anything here's money because he killed the investigation into
[02:25:24.820 --> 02:25:33.940]  uranium one i mean this is open and shut a jury would fry mueller if there was still an electric
[02:25:33.940 --> 02:25:41.380]  chair he'd be sent to it like the rozenbergs for espionage former fbi assistant director
[02:25:41.380 --> 02:25:48.980]  james colstrom called disgrace fbi agent peter struck a total moron close quote and by total
[02:25:48.980 --> 02:25:53.860]  moron i mean he's in emails and text messages framing people who belongs in levin worth that's a
[02:25:53.860 --> 02:25:58.020]  quote i don't just get up here and say they should go to prison i know how to read the law
[02:26:05.620 --> 02:26:10.420]  and it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say i don't know what's going to happen
[02:26:10.420 --> 02:26:18.340]  at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got one from the front lines
[02:26:18.340 --> 02:26:29.140]  of the information war it's alex jones one of our great producers out here daria who actually
[02:26:29.140 --> 02:26:35.540]  did intelligence in the u.s. army in special forces ran in here and said look at this we've
[02:26:35.540 --> 02:26:41.700]  been looking at this for the last 30 minutes it's confirmed and this is breaking right now here on
[02:26:41.700 --> 02:26:49.380]  air because when i learned this news during the last break my head exploded because i remember
[02:26:49.380 --> 02:26:58.100]  antifa pledging all over the country but especially the midwest and in the west to derail trains
[02:26:58.100 --> 02:27:08.260]  trains in areas where oil field work is being done and now it's going down dot org has removed
[02:27:08.260 --> 02:27:18.340]  the article but it is saved on archive dot is olympia washington train track sabotage
[02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:25.700]  to stop fracking equipment and this is from just a few months ago on four twenty seventeen
[02:27:25.700 --> 02:27:31.700]  early in the morning on april twenty report concrete on the train tracks that lead out
[02:27:31.700 --> 02:27:36.180]  of the port of olympia to block any trains this action was done to disrupt the movement of trains
[02:27:36.180 --> 02:27:45.060]  carrying parts used in natural gas fracking and they go on to say stop the five hundred years
[02:27:45.060 --> 02:27:50.980]  of colonization and industrialization this is basically communist earth first type stuff and
[02:27:50.980 --> 02:27:59.700]  and they talk about staging more terror attacks so the story has just gone up on info wars dot com
[02:28:02.100 --> 02:28:08.820]  it has just been posted choosing sides getting organized and guess what they have a little
[02:28:08.820 --> 02:28:15.620]  communist flag for antifa and their black flag for no surrender but guess what let's go back
[02:28:15.620 --> 02:28:19.460]  to the piece let's go back to their twitter they may have pulled the article off their site but not
[02:28:19.460 --> 02:28:25.300]  their twitter here we endorse crimes like pouring concrete on train tracks we also include a how to
[02:28:25.300 --> 02:28:31.380]  do video at the bottom of the article imagine these are people funded by the democratic party in
[02:28:31.380 --> 02:28:38.420]  soros openly talking about how to sabotage train tracks and they've now just pulled the article
[02:28:38.420 --> 02:28:43.060]  off their page but not their twitter yet so we're exposing it all here we've got a bunch of people
[02:28:43.060 --> 02:28:51.380]  dead 80 plus at the hospital the train goes off the tracks into the highway on route five not out
[02:28:51.380 --> 02:28:55.940]  the middle of nowhere but right where antifa would probably strike for maximum damage people think

[02:33:40.980 --> 02:33:46.660]  intelligence agencies around the western world rounding up massive pedophile rings so he's
[02:33:46.660 --> 02:33:49.620]  going to be joining us here in just a moment be with us a little bit in the next hour
[02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:59.940]  it hit me like a ton of bricks when i learned of this today because i remembered news articles
[02:33:59.940 --> 02:34:08.020]  where antifa communist social scripts funded by george soros were openly calling for sabotaging
[02:34:08.980 --> 02:34:17.460]  trains that were in regions where oil drilling or fracking was going on and where i read on their
[02:34:17.460 --> 02:34:24.020]  own sites calls for attacking trump tower trump golf courses uh you name it they say violence is
[02:34:24.020 --> 02:34:32.580]  okay if you go to their twitter page they brag in washington about attacking train tracks with
[02:34:33.540 --> 02:34:41.460]  concrete blocks that they form at the site for sabotage and derailment of trains here we endorse
[02:34:41.460 --> 02:34:48.180]  crimes again in their own words here we endorse crimes like pouring concrete on train tracks we
[02:34:48.180 --> 02:34:52.660]  also include a how-to video at bottom of the article we're not going to show you the how-to
[02:34:52.660 --> 02:34:57.700]  video before they take it down as evidence let's download it now i remember all this in the last
[02:34:57.700 --> 02:35:05.940]  six months they've already derailed trains in washington so now they've pulled down the article
[02:35:05.940 --> 02:35:11.940]  olympia washington train tracks sabotage to stop fracking where they brag about derailing trains
[02:35:11.940 --> 02:35:17.300]  and how they're going to do it more and how they're training others how to do it then we have amtrak
[02:35:17.300 --> 02:35:22.660]  derailing onto the highway killing at least three and over 80 some of the hospital crashing down
[02:35:22.660 --> 02:35:32.740]  into cars and all of that horrible carnage you have a criminal group saying we derail trains
[02:35:32.740 --> 02:35:36.020]  they were never busted they never got in trouble because there's so many of these groups
[02:35:36.020 --> 02:35:41.620]  now this has happened and i guarantee you mainstream media will attack me for even implying
[02:35:42.580 --> 02:35:49.140]  that antifa would do such a thing but they're prime suspects after infrastructure
[02:35:50.820 --> 02:35:55.460]  but this is simply amazing and notice happened in a very populated area not on the rest of
[02:35:55.460 --> 02:36:03.300]  scenic route perfectly place for antifa so what horrible horrible horrible people that they've
[02:36:03.300 --> 02:36:09.380]  already done it they videotape themselves doing it and it wasn't even national news and i just saw it
[02:36:09.380 --> 02:36:14.100]  you know it as a footnote kind of mentioned it because we just are used to these bullies it's
[02:36:14.100 --> 02:36:18.180]  like what they do so the story is now upon info wars dot com
[02:36:18.180 --> 02:36:28.340]  and again headline antifa admits to sabotaging railways trying to derail trains and training
[02:36:28.340 --> 02:36:35.300]  others to do it in the very state where this just happened unbelievable it's like somebody says
[02:36:35.300 --> 02:36:39.700]  i'm gonna attack the impar states building with a dump truck and then it happens you are the suspect
[02:36:39.700 --> 02:36:45.060]  wow so those stories are up on info wars dot com right now you need to get this story out to
[02:36:45.060 --> 02:36:50.740]  everybody now joining us is a great guy frequent guest on the broadcast and he's got a lot of
[02:36:50.740 --> 02:36:57.940]  exciting things going on craig soyer and there's a lot of things i want to cover with him today
[02:36:57.940 --> 02:37:04.580]  and we're going to be going over that with him but early on we told you that trump was putting
[02:37:04.580 --> 02:37:10.500]  a focus on and green lighting going at her pedophile rings we've seen unlimited arrests
[02:37:10.500 --> 02:37:16.820]  going on we've seen uh just massive things happening but then no coverage once it happens
[02:37:17.940 --> 02:37:24.660]  no coverage of what's happened once it unfolds so the press has not been willing to cover it
[02:37:24.660 --> 02:37:28.260]  you'll see hundreds of arrests here hundreds of arrests there all these children all these women
[02:37:28.260 --> 02:37:33.460]  freed and then no coverage after that so craig had an idea in the last year he's now put it
[02:37:33.460 --> 02:37:39.620]  into action tactical insider dot com vets for child rescue dot org there's a new tv program
[02:37:39.620 --> 02:37:43.780]  in film they're developing i think it's best craig breakdown just some of the basic facts
[02:37:43.780 --> 02:37:47.620]  and give you the breaking news then we have a trailer for one of the first installments craig

[02:37:53.140 --> 02:37:59.460]  to start here again craig soyer should have said marine veteran former navy seal sniper tv show host

[02:38:05.220 --> 02:38:09.300]  so so again firearms expert what got you into this and where is the rabbit trail from all your
[02:38:09.300 --> 02:38:16.260]  sources led you well what got me into this alex really was having the network of fellow professionals
[02:38:16.260 --> 02:38:23.140]  that they could help in situations like this and just having my heart pounded on after learning
[02:38:24.020 --> 02:38:29.540]  the nature of this this crisis and what they're doing to the children these child traffickers
[02:38:29.540 --> 02:38:35.060]  after the trump election and the increase of the arrests on child traffickers so i just really
[02:38:35.060 --> 02:38:40.660]  could not look away alex and i rallied my resources and connections against it and that's really what
[02:38:40.660 --> 02:38:46.340]  veterans for child rescue is all about we started off to be an alert service to alert the populace
[02:38:46.340 --> 02:38:53.380]  to the fact that there is a serious crisis of child trafficking inside the continental united
[02:38:53.380 --> 02:38:58.580]  states and then we we branched out with that capability to do additional things extracting
[02:38:58.580 --> 02:39:04.100]  the child victims themselves arresting the perps now and empowering the children through
[02:39:04.100 --> 02:39:09.380]  preventive educational programs and one that i found to be particularly inspiring that i want to

[02:40:23.380 --> 02:40:30.420]  and it comes off of the word contraband and sadly enough sickenly enough our children have become
[02:40:30.420 --> 02:40:36.820]  the new contraband for the black market so they're they're treating children like the next narcotic
[02:40:36.820 --> 02:40:45.220]  or you know black market arms dealer uh currency so they're the new contraband and so uh you know
[02:40:45.220 --> 02:40:50.820]  the staff came up with the working title contra contra land uh we may change that but for now
[02:40:50.820 --> 02:40:55.380]  that's that's the title where we're literally it's not art it's not drugs anymore it's children and
[02:40:55.380 --> 02:40:59.220]  we see hollywood the whole culture you know they said oh a year ago we were talking about this none
[02:40:59.220 --> 02:41:03.700]  of it's happening there are no pedophiles and now we see hollywood getting busted and all of it coming
[02:41:03.700 --> 02:41:08.660]  out it's really amazing so again here's a short director's cut version the documentary trailer
[02:41:08.660 --> 02:41:12.420]  of the working title is contra land refers to children now sadly becoming another commodity
[02:41:13.140 --> 02:41:17.460]  contraband on the black market as he just said we've been tweeting that at avonka trump
[02:41:17.460 --> 02:41:21.620]  chugger carlson and shan handy and others that get them start covering it so the whole damn
[02:41:21.620 --> 02:41:26.020]  will break we're going to retweet that right now at real alec show so here is a little snippet
[02:41:26.660 --> 02:41:33.540]  what kind of demand for child sex justifies the number two million child sex slaves
[02:41:33.540 --> 02:41:42.980]  everybody has access to your kids like they've never had access to your kids before
[02:41:42.980 --> 02:42:00.420]  the highest child rape consumption country in the world is right here in the united states
[02:42:13.220 --> 02:42:17.700]  we're going to go to brighton talk about this from when i researched that's one reason the
[02:42:17.700 --> 02:42:21.780]  leftist and the globalist want to bring in all these quote migrants and undocumented and and
[02:42:21.780 --> 02:42:25.620]  kind of not even having to be listed or named when they come across the border is that then they can
[02:42:25.620 --> 02:42:31.540]  just disappear well it's not to the migrants benefit it's not that the globalists are so
[02:42:31.540 --> 02:42:37.700]  kind-hearted that they want to these migrants to have a better life look if they if they import
[02:42:37.700 --> 02:42:43.460]  terror and if they import criminals then they have the excuse to treat us all like terrorists
[02:42:43.460 --> 02:42:48.580]  and criminals and take more of our rights so it's just a big game that the globalists play and they
[02:42:48.580 --> 02:42:53.540]  put it under the title or or guides of being a compassionate but it's it's like everything else

[02:47:39.060 --> 02:47:47.860]  discovered and i got so angry i'd remembered that antifa uh had said that they would attack trains
[02:47:47.860 --> 02:47:54.420]  and had attack trains in oregon to stop commerce uh in america well guess what it turns out there
[02:47:54.420 --> 02:48:01.700]  in the town where this happened in that area dozens were camping out there to physically
[02:48:01.700 --> 02:48:06.900]  stand in front of the trains block the tracks and sabotage it so it's now the media will try to cover
[02:48:06.900 --> 02:48:12.980]  this up but gateway pundit hasn't until every officer is down antifa ant uh anarchist sabotage
[02:48:12.980 --> 02:48:20.180]  train and olympia have commune rated by police and are camping on the tracks in multiple towns
[02:48:20.180 --> 02:48:26.420]  and cities including where the train got hit so craig soyer you're a former counterterrorism guy and
[02:48:26.420 --> 02:48:31.140]  a federal officer i want to get back in this segment and a few more uh with you into the new
[02:48:31.700 --> 02:48:37.060]  two hour uh pilot documentary film uh contraband and and the breakthrough stuff you're about to
[02:48:37.060 --> 02:48:41.140]  give us exclusively here about how you got access to law enforcement because none of the other media
[02:48:41.140 --> 02:48:44.500]  will cover it that's why they brought you in because they're scared uh because i guess they're
[02:48:44.500 --> 02:48:49.700]  trying to cover it up we've seen that what do you make of this uh a trained derailment and the calls
[02:48:49.700 --> 02:48:54.340]  are to move trump and just garbos saying get ready for a civil war as their whole russia
[02:48:54.340 --> 02:49:00.660]  thing disintegrates i can't imagine any other country alex where any of this would be tolerated
[02:49:00.660 --> 02:49:06.740]  for one minute i would expect for there to be a massive law enforcement response to this it's
[02:49:06.740 --> 02:49:11.700]  an act of terror it's clearly an act of terror on backgrounds and counterterrorism i i know
[02:49:11.700 --> 02:49:17.780]  terrorism when i see it i don't know why this is being tolerated this this should be answered
[02:49:17.780 --> 02:49:24.500]  within overwhelming law enforcement to answer a swift one uh this is just only in bizarro world
[02:49:24.500 --> 02:49:29.620]  is this allowed to just faster and and continue the way that it is i don't understand it absolutely
[02:49:29.620 --> 02:49:35.620]  and again they're on their official uh it's going down on orc site saying we sabotage trains
[02:49:35.620 --> 02:49:41.700]  here's a video of us doing it and we're going to do it more and then months later in the very area
[02:49:41.700 --> 02:49:46.420]  nothing's done i mean local police have been writing them but it didn't stop it i mean this is
[02:49:46.420 --> 02:49:52.100]  just insane imagine if they all strike across the entire country as move on dot org and the
[02:49:52.100 --> 02:49:56.340]  antifa groups are calling for if trump doesn't step down i mean i guess they're just going to burn
[02:49:56.340 --> 02:49:58.740]  all the train tracks blow everything up and then we're just going to let them do it
[02:50:01.460 --> 02:50:07.060]  and just unbelievable well we need to move against this just just ridiculous this is a
[02:50:07.060 --> 02:50:13.700]  ridiculous situation i'm waiting for for the swat teams to descend upon those who are behind
[02:50:13.700 --> 02:50:20.740]  antifa the funding the management who is it that are urging these these misguided
[02:50:21.300 --> 02:50:27.300]  children if you will and young college students and just lost adults to go commit acts of terror
[02:50:27.300 --> 02:50:32.580]  against their own country why why are they not behind bars for what they've done already it's
[02:50:32.580 --> 02:50:36.500]  it's insane and i love how they demonize all industry as if it's bad and then don't think
[02:50:36.500 --> 02:50:40.020]  if they put stuff out there it's going to derail a passenger train with men women and
[02:50:40.020 --> 02:50:44.660]  children on who are now dead i mean indeed that's what this was but they're they're saying attack
[02:50:44.660 --> 02:50:50.820]  it so they're prime suspects well if you look at it from an adult perspective it could only be a
[02:50:50.820 --> 02:50:56.900]  an undeveloped mind that would come up with such a ridiculous notion to go blow things up and somehow
[02:50:56.900 --> 02:51:04.500]  thinks they think that it's going to improve anything so i i look at it more as a tactic
[02:51:04.500 --> 02:51:12.100]  by our enemy to try to divide and and manipulate the weak the weak minded in the united states
[02:51:12.100 --> 02:51:18.660]  and misguide them against us against the the patriotic americans against american strength
[02:51:18.660 --> 02:51:24.740]  in our best interest so i just see that those is unwitting pawns who are being abused and probably
[02:51:24.740 --> 02:51:30.500]  cast aside and sacrificed by george solos and other oh absolutely let's get back into the film now
[02:51:30.500 --> 02:51:35.940]  but obviously breaking news correct soyer here a former highly decorated navy seal patriot you
[02:51:35.940 --> 02:51:40.580]  know tv show host you name it now working on a documentary that's nearing completion two hours
[02:51:40.580 --> 02:51:47.620]  long contra land uh wow i mean i just see in the footage you've been given access to exclusively
[02:51:47.620 --> 02:51:50.980]  law enforcement raids around the country tell us what you discovered
[02:51:53.460 --> 02:51:59.380]  well we're discovering that this is a really widespread pervasive problem with the child
[02:51:59.380 --> 02:52:05.620]  trafficking and that it's a very complex one and some areas we've got district attorneys and
[02:52:05.620 --> 02:52:10.020]  sheriffs that are open in their arms and say and thank god you're here let's do some great business
[02:52:10.020 --> 02:52:15.060]  and we've got some fantastic operations that we are just now starting new operations for us
[02:52:16.340 --> 02:52:23.060]  where we're going to be able to put the perpetrators away and rescue the children victims that are
[02:52:23.060 --> 02:52:30.180]  in their possession and other places where sadly enough district attorneys and sheriffs are saying
[02:52:31.060 --> 02:52:36.420]  we don't want people to know that this goes on and this is such a big problem in our city
[02:52:36.420 --> 02:52:41.460]  so no thank you we we're not going to cooperate with you and play ball we'd rather keep it hidden
[02:52:42.260 --> 02:52:47.140]  and my god uh to us that was like a kick in the stomach like well no wonder this is so big
[02:52:47.140 --> 02:52:53.300]  you know evil expands and that's how we got here that's how we got in this mess of the
[02:52:53.300 --> 02:52:58.900]  evil tentacles wrapped itself wrapped itself around our country to the degree that it did
[02:52:58.900 --> 02:53:04.900]  and has the grip on our country that it does is because weak men looked away and allowed it
[02:53:04.900 --> 02:53:12.340]  and we cannot tolerate we cannot afford that mindset any longer we have to pull up our big
[02:53:12.340 --> 02:53:18.180]  boy pants as american citizens and all do a little bit so that together we can have a huge
[02:53:18.180 --> 02:53:23.540]  effect at beating this back because it got help us men if we can't stand up for the innocent
[02:53:23.540 --> 02:53:28.900]  precious children then who are we we got no business uh breathing breathing up oxygen if we
[02:53:28.900 --> 02:53:33.140]  can't do that that's the least amount of at least among us should be able to do that so
[02:53:33.780 --> 02:53:38.100]  we're just trying to rally the people to pay attention and join us man it's we're not asking
[02:53:38.100 --> 02:53:42.500]  everybody to to be the one to stand up and save the day for everybody but if we all do a little
[02:53:42.500 --> 02:53:47.540]  bit it counts for a lot well i know that i've been briefed by people that have been on federal
[02:53:47.540 --> 02:53:53.140]  task forces and and assigned to them and they say you can bust a few of the low level but then
[02:53:53.140 --> 02:53:58.660]  it's always up above it especially when they're having big football events or big championship
[02:53:58.660 --> 02:54:05.060]  events that uh they the globalist pick cities that will cover it up just like you were saying
[02:54:05.060 --> 02:54:09.860]  and then they just stop even federal law enforcement uh military task forces that have
[02:54:09.860 --> 02:54:16.340]  tried to be involved and they say 100 percent it is it is expanding as you said and now becoming
[02:54:16.340 --> 02:54:22.260]  like a commodity to become so pervasive it's become basically industrialized they have formulas uh
[02:54:22.260 --> 02:54:26.660]  and that what's fueling it is the massive amounts of migrants we know that hillary got caught and
[02:54:26.660 --> 02:54:30.500]  a bunch of people went to prison trying to ship in thousands of little kids out of Haiti without
[02:54:30.500 --> 02:54:36.900]  any records and a bunch of them disappeared and so this is a sickening commodity and that's why
[02:54:36.900 --> 02:54:40.660]  they want giant unwashed third world populations that are unvetted because they can just be
[02:54:40.660 --> 02:54:45.300]  disappeared that's why you know found these trailers with 60 70 80 men women and children in them
[02:54:45.300 --> 02:54:49.780]  dead just because somebody didn't pay the money at the other end like they wanted they just locked
[02:54:49.780 --> 02:54:54.340]  the door and everybody dies i mean this is and then and then robert rodriguez makes films about
[02:54:54.340 --> 02:54:59.300]  how texans are on the border shooting hispanics but meanwhile it's the mexican cartels and the
[02:54:59.300 --> 02:55:06.980]  democratic party who literally used hispanics like throwaway garbage yeah well i i believe
[02:55:07.860 --> 02:55:14.660]  as trump drains the swamp we'll be able to remove people in key leadership positions throughout the
[02:55:14.660 --> 02:55:19.780]  chain of command and federal and local law enforcement that are perpetuating the problem
[02:55:19.780 --> 02:55:25.860]  there like as you alluded to there are no go zones and times uh surrounding the super bowl
[02:55:25.860 --> 02:55:30.340]  with all these elites that come in they descend upon a city and they want every you know they
[02:55:30.340 --> 02:55:35.460]  want to purchase every manner of perversion children being one of those and it's provided for them
[02:55:35.460 --> 02:55:40.180]  and law enforcement that's why so many elites go to the big kanducky derby's or the super bowl in
[02:55:40.180 --> 02:55:45.140]  houston or any of these places is for that time it becomes the no go zone and then there's promise
[02:55:45.140 --> 02:55:51.540]  protection for huge amounts of payments just for that time sadly enough it's true sadly enough it's
[02:55:51.540 --> 02:55:56.180]  true same thing with the border there are areas and times where uh there are corridors that are
[02:55:56.180 --> 02:56:02.340]  looked away from and both sides know it and we the people are suffering the consequences of it so
[02:56:02.900 --> 02:56:09.620]  again as these people um these subversives and obstructionists throughout the chain of command
[02:56:09.620 --> 02:56:15.220]  are removed i think things will clean up and it'll it'll make a lot more sense and there'll be an
[02:56:15.220 --> 02:56:22.340]  increase in the rate of the cascading avalanche of failures of of these these criminal enterprises
[02:56:22.340 --> 02:56:26.420]  that are abusing so many of it i was about to bring that up they are running scared right now

[03:00:40.100 --> 03:00:45.700]  strike back because their russia investigations falling apart been proven inside jobs spectacularly
[03:00:45.700 --> 03:00:50.580]  it shows how arrogant they are that was so shoddy how they paid for it they admit it's fake
[03:00:50.580 --> 03:00:55.860]  i mean they should all go to jail this is crazy well we'll have our special uh
[03:00:56.500 --> 03:01:01.700]  council in the new year and hopefully we can pick up all those loose ends and bring them to justice
[03:01:01.700 --> 03:01:08.820]  i was in tears yesterday when i saw the republican congress on the steps there with the president
[03:01:08.820 --> 03:01:16.100]  and i mean it's just an incredible accomplishment it's it's taken you know three decades to bring
[03:01:16.100 --> 03:01:25.300]  this about it was four years but the leader of this whole exercise is a person that took center
[03:01:25.300 --> 03:01:31.300]  stage he shared the stage with many of its authors of course but without donald trump this wouldn't
[03:01:31.300 --> 03:01:39.300]  have happened so he also you know remind your listeners said uh in the white house and again
[03:01:39.300 --> 03:01:47.860]  yesterday it was that uh we had probably a decade from the white house he's heard them from his own
[03:01:47.860 --> 03:01:53.860]  lips merry christmas and again it seems like they make fun of it but they're trying to ban it everywhere
[03:01:53.860 --> 03:01:58.100]  that's what an incredible cult of control freaks uh these people are
[03:01:58.100 --> 03:02:06.180]  oh they've had this war against christmas on for you know more than two decades and christmas
[03:02:06.180 --> 03:02:12.180]  has become an enormous you know commercial occasion now so we've divorced it pretty much from its
[03:02:12.180 --> 03:02:18.420]  really just original original you know context so i mean where i want to go in this last few
[03:02:18.420 --> 03:02:24.980]  minutes is basically just to remind the listeners that you know my life their lives are a gift
[03:02:24.980 --> 03:02:30.500]  and so too are the goods that come to me and you and the gifts that we're going to have under
[03:02:30.500 --> 03:02:35.940]  our tree in the next few days they come from the source that that granted life and and once we see
[03:02:35.940 --> 03:02:43.140]  the world in that way which frankly is the way of faith then we see the reality of gift love
[03:02:43.140 --> 03:02:50.580]  and how the world is ordered and we see its power we see the change of of gift and gratitude
[03:02:50.580 --> 03:02:56.740]  spread to all things and it leads to our own spiritual well-being and we can join to them
[03:02:56.740 --> 03:03:01.620]  and these are not burdensome chains on the contrary i think their ingredients their main
[03:03:01.620 --> 03:03:07.300]  ingredient is actually freedom and by linking to these chains we receive a benefit far greater than
[03:03:07.300 --> 03:03:12.260]  the one exactly i mean you have a child to take care of them and they take care of you everything
[03:03:12.260 --> 03:03:17.780]  is symbiotic in god's plan you see the incredible it's like all these atheist math mathematicians
[03:03:17.780 --> 03:03:22.260]  genetic engineers they finally they become masters they go god there's a god it all
[03:03:22.260 --> 03:03:28.420]  works so perfectly and it couldn't just come together by itself and this is the story of
[03:03:28.420 --> 03:03:36.740]  christmas god gave his only beloved son so that we could have eternal life and that is of course
[03:03:36.740 --> 03:03:45.380]  the greatest gift of all time it's it's his story it's the great drama of human existence so
[03:03:45.380 --> 03:03:53.700]  when we celebrate the advent this year we should remember that nativity scene uh we need to think
[03:03:53.700 --> 03:04:01.460]  about that form of gift love of god's grace which is bestowed on every one of us on his creation
[03:04:01.460 --> 03:04:07.300]  in the first instance but to every single one of us as human beings and then we can have a very
[03:04:07.300 --> 03:04:12.980]  blessed christmas because we can celebrate the christ mass i'd explain to somebody the other day
[03:04:12.980 --> 03:04:20.260]  that christmas actually means if you can believe this christ mass it does it means them the mass of
[03:04:20.260 --> 03:04:30.580]  christ's birth and death and risen that's it christ was born in christmas he had his ministry on
[03:04:30.580 --> 03:04:36.980]  earth for a short period of time he died and ascended into heaven and he takes us there
[03:04:36.980 --> 03:04:43.860]  is our final place so you have to have the whole sweep of that story humanity makes it we're going
[03:04:43.860 --> 03:04:48.980]  to the heavens ted malik incredible it's all allegory it's all there it's all a transmission

[03:07:01.940 --> 03:07:06.900]  with his compound media dot com doing a great job but i wanted to hit this piece that's on info wars
[03:07:06.900 --> 03:07:13.620]  dot com and news wars dot com leftist students ripped down races kate stanley moral boasters
[03:07:14.660 --> 03:07:24.020]  you know i literally got heart palpitations and i've never had those before uh last couple weeks
[03:07:24.020 --> 03:07:33.140]  ago when i went shroyer went downtown and men with guns not guns operating their free speech
[03:07:33.140 --> 03:07:38.820]  or their second amendment but men with guns said you're not going to the capital rally and then
[03:07:38.820 --> 03:07:42.980]  blocked him and attacked him with clubs and you know he's like a patriot i'm into but all the
[03:07:42.980 --> 03:07:47.300]  hit me with clubs would let me in on big deal hey you guys are idiots but he was assaulted
[03:07:48.340 --> 03:07:50.580]  and they the antifa wouldn't let him get in for a
[03:07:52.740 --> 03:07:58.580]  kate stanley memorial for this poor beautiful young woman that lover was just black his panic
[03:07:58.580 --> 03:08:07.620]  whatever shot in the back with her father she had dreams too and you've got this guy who's been
[03:08:07.620 --> 03:08:14.420]  deported five times it's like the railway killer he was deported i forget like 15 times i think he
[03:08:14.420 --> 03:08:19.060]  killed like 40 something people all of them were hispanic by the way he thought that hispanics
[03:08:19.060 --> 03:08:24.260]  are serial killers or have a higher innocence of crime it's that they can go to any cutter they want
[03:08:24.260 --> 03:08:28.980]  and governments just let him in because this globalist operation to open up the americas so this
[03:08:28.980 --> 03:08:35.860]  literal lunatic shoots her in the back and then the jury won't even convict him of manslaughter
[03:08:36.500 --> 03:08:41.620]  which would just mean he didn't know he killed her but still you're liable seven years in jail
[03:08:41.620 --> 03:08:47.220]  california it's like that in most states serve like three years maybe two if you're good behavior
[03:08:47.220 --> 03:08:57.060]  maybe one federally serve 90 states serve like a third a half there's video at the college where
[03:08:57.060 --> 03:09:03.300]  somebody put up i had dreams too and again she's a white lady i think she has some hispanics in
[03:09:03.300 --> 03:09:07.540]  her family it doesn't matter hispanics are a mix of white folks and natives and the spanish
[03:09:07.540 --> 03:09:13.140]  bloods of some north african does it matter we're all humans beautiful uh the spanish women all
[03:09:13.140 --> 03:09:18.980]  of them are beautiful everybody's beautiful i love everybody the point is is that she gets
[03:09:18.980 --> 03:09:24.260]  killed out with her daddy eating a snow cone and the left can't even send the jerk
[03:09:25.060 --> 03:09:30.180]  whacked out of mentally ill put him in mental institution they won't do anything and they say
[03:09:31.220 --> 03:09:35.860]  19 people run over one of them they say is basically dead brain dead and they wouldn't
[03:09:35.860 --> 03:09:40.420]  even say it's a muslim they go well it's isis but it's mentally ill yeah the nazis were mentally ill
[03:09:40.420 --> 03:09:46.900]  humans go into these weird things uh you and you can say other cultures were mentally ill
[03:09:48.340 --> 03:09:58.020]  so they they the killer and then we got video at the university where they won't
[03:09:59.460 --> 03:10:03.780]  even let them put up signs they could put up every other sign they want kill the cops you
[03:10:03.780 --> 03:10:10.740]  name it that's in the article but you can't put up a sign just saying she had dreams too left the
[03:10:10.740 --> 03:10:15.460]  students ripped down racist cake stanley memorial posters because see they're scared of a martyr
[03:10:15.460 --> 03:10:21.220]  and my own reporters at austin can't go to a rally for her that was by the way black hispanic
[03:10:21.220 --> 03:10:25.460]  everybody you name it there's nobody let me tell you something you try to go to a patriot
[03:10:25.460 --> 03:10:29.140]  meeting if you're some white supremacist will kick your ass and you have your free speech i'm just
[03:10:29.140 --> 03:10:35.220]  just i'm not doing this because i hate black people or anybody else i'm doing this because i want
[03:10:35.220 --> 03:10:48.420]  justice and the left is so evil as like a union as like a system that they they will they will
[03:10:48.420 --> 03:10:52.900]  defend anything as long as they're white which again is using race culture which is very primitive
[03:10:52.900 --> 03:10:58.100]  very bad we're fighting nazism which means we're fighting this the nazis were a race culture it
[03:10:58.100 --> 03:11:05.380]  works we're primitive we'll do it well they got the whites in i'm not just being not defending
[03:11:05.380 --> 03:11:12.020]  leftist to say this but it's mainly white people that are engaging in race baiting two minority
[03:11:12.020 --> 03:11:17.620]  groups trying to get them to be racist and they got some blacks to do it and i guess a small minority
[03:11:17.620 --> 03:11:24.820]  hispanics but i don't want to bash white people but it's mainly white people you name it jewish
[03:11:24.820 --> 03:11:32.340]  uh german whatever background to push this and you read the southern property law center adl put
[03:11:32.340 --> 03:11:39.460]  out is the most classic racist crap you've ever seen and so now this dead woman people can't
[03:11:39.460 --> 03:11:43.860]  have a rally in austin forum you can't have hand up signs in san francisco conservative students
[03:11:43.860 --> 03:11:48.820]  continue mourning the death of kate stanley the woman murdered by a legal alien given sanctuary
[03:11:48.820 --> 03:11:53.140]  and remember most of his victims were hispanic i'm not just saying that the virtue signal that's
[03:11:53.140 --> 03:11:58.180]  just being heard people say oh thank you for caring about an hispanic person or a black
[03:11:58.180 --> 03:12:03.060]  i care about everybody folks because i got feelings in san francisco a leftist students
[03:12:03.060 --> 03:12:09.060]  continues to be triggered by her memory and they again pull down the the the posters saying it's
[03:12:09.060 --> 03:12:18.980]  racist so here they are anti-free speech here's the video oh you guys got a problem with the posters
[03:12:18.980 --> 03:12:25.060]  huh you guys got a problem with the posters yes and what would that be um the problem
[03:12:25.060 --> 03:12:32.180]  brought by things you have dreams to you're putting quite a um racist view point oh dreams
[03:12:32.180 --> 03:12:37.460]  of aces now huh these are white women you know i'm not gonna have this conversation with you you're
[03:12:37.460 --> 03:12:42.340]  gonna have that kind of tone so oh my tone right now talk to you you don't want to have a conversation
[03:12:42.340 --> 03:12:48.820]  in the first place you'd rather care about posters these are women that the state is their man
[03:12:53.620 --> 03:12:59.940]  so they they take down her picture and notice that jury had most mainly a white jury they had
[03:12:59.940 --> 03:13:05.140]  to say we will not put a hispanic man in jail because she's white if he'd have been hispanic
[03:13:05.140 --> 03:13:12.980]  he'd have gone to prison because they can't ever say their policies are wrong and then they have to
[03:13:12.980 --> 03:13:20.820]  take her picture now so she had dreams too and she did she's in a coffin she's a skeleton now
[03:13:21.780 --> 03:13:26.260]  and you know i you're not going to hear one activist you're not going to hear those liberal white
[03:13:26.260 --> 03:13:30.100]  women that want to just act like they're on this big jihad and they live in this little fantasy
[03:13:30.100 --> 03:13:34.660]  land university where they can do this probably but they both look like professors or assistant
[03:13:34.660 --> 03:13:43.940]  professors most of the anti-fight is did they say hey hispanics hate that words just people
[03:13:44.580 --> 03:13:51.620]  you shouldn't take Gardasil it sterilizes and reduces fertility massively here's the studies
[03:13:51.620 --> 03:13:57.380]  and they in mexico tied imf and world bank money billions of dollars to giving hispanic
[03:13:57.380 --> 03:14:03.300]  women Gardasil and then it sterilizes them it reduces their fertility doesn't completely
[03:14:03.300 --> 03:14:08.660]  sterilize them it's statistical but it reduces it and then i have people go hey man i've had this
[03:14:08.660 --> 03:14:14.020]  a few times like not with white people even but but it's like they go hey if you're worried about
[03:14:14.020 --> 03:14:19.620]  all the mexicans or whatever why are you they're just people i'm not going to put what mexicans
[03:14:19.620 --> 03:14:25.700]  being racist against me don't like me because i'm quote white even though i'm part native american
[03:14:25.700 --> 03:14:30.820]  i can say statistically you know i'm i'm hispanic that's all that means i don't want them to get
[03:14:30.820 --> 03:14:37.220]  screwed me nobody i just want a future together we can all by the time we reach 50 light years from
[03:14:37.220 --> 03:14:42.020]  here we'll all just be basically a nice medium brown color folks we're probably going to blow

[03:14:53.300 --> 03:14:59.140]  if i heard one mecheloraza group say don't take the Gardasil shot i'd say maybe mecheloraza is
[03:14:59.140 --> 03:15:03.700]  a good group but they don't because they're bought and paid for they want to make you dumb racist to

[03:20:31.540 --> 03:20:40.180]  to everybody over there uh over here at infowars uh i was listening to alex before uh this uh
[03:20:40.180 --> 03:20:50.340]  uh for the past probably a half hour my god my god that the kate steinall debacle over there
[03:20:50.340 --> 03:21:02.340]  in california it's heart wrenching and infuriating just the sheer anger that um you feel looking at
[03:21:02.340 --> 03:21:08.980]  something like this uh from beginning to end the second we heard that uh she was murdered
[03:21:08.980 --> 03:21:20.420]  right there in front of her her dad i mean just a beautiful um creative uh contributing member
[03:21:20.980 --> 03:21:28.580]  of society uh and it's rare that we see that in in the news that there's people that actually
[03:21:28.580 --> 03:21:36.100]  are doing something and and have a family structure she's out with her dad how how much more uh
[03:21:36.100 --> 03:21:43.140]  american can you get just the dad out with his daughter beautiful day out by the water it's it's uh
[03:21:45.140 --> 03:21:51.540]  it's just such an affront to everything that we hold dear to us in this country
[03:21:52.260 --> 03:21:59.460]  and her life is snuffed out by uh someone that shouldn't even have been in this country
[03:21:59.460 --> 03:22:09.460]  it's so easy to see it's so simple for any rational human being to see the good and the
[03:22:09.460 --> 03:22:16.900]  bad in this the right and the wrong the just and the unjust that we see in this entire story
[03:22:17.460 --> 03:22:27.860]  from the moment she was she was killed until this very second it's not difficult for somebody
[03:22:27.860 --> 03:22:43.220]  that has a rational thought process to see what's wrong here yet he he's not convicted of like
[03:22:43.220 --> 03:22:51.860]  alex said even manslaughter you pick up a gun uh and it accidentally discharges and goes into somebody
[03:22:51.860 --> 03:22:59.300]  it's a pretty good case for manslaughter there and that was the defense saying that's what happened
[03:22:59.300 --> 03:23:11.380]  you know and they they don't even convict him of that based on what evidence now it's based on a
[03:23:11.380 --> 03:23:22.420]  thought process and a system over there in um california and especially the the bay area that
[03:23:22.420 --> 03:23:33.300]  says that um that woman's life was not worth as much as the life of uh somebody who was deported
[03:23:33.300 --> 03:23:42.420]  five times uh obviously a criminal uh and they they let him go because of that this was based
[03:23:43.060 --> 03:23:53.220]  on race and culture and and and social status all of it the the the idea of of justice
[03:23:53.220 --> 03:24:02.260]  and weighing evidence and and doling out uh punishment for crimes committed had nothing to
[03:24:02.260 --> 03:24:12.340]  do with this uh the legal proceedings in this case it was all politically motivated all motivated
[03:24:12.340 --> 03:24:19.140]  by uh the the the liberal agenda in california and especially up there in the the bay area
[03:24:19.140 --> 03:24:29.220]  and we saw the result of that uh is the entire country like this thank god no but uh there are
[03:24:29.220 --> 03:24:38.660]  many areas in this country that are are completely the opposite of what america is supposed to be
[03:24:38.660 --> 03:24:46.340]  about and when we come around uh we get around to to christmas time which we are the the christmas
[03:24:46.340 --> 03:24:55.300]  season um we we get nostalgic and we start looking back to uh our our youth and and remembering
[03:24:55.940 --> 03:25:03.780]  what america was back then what celebrating christmas was how much it was all about family
[03:25:03.780 --> 03:25:15.860]  and common values in this country a common culture the idea that we all know as americans
[03:25:15.860 --> 03:25:23.860]  what's right what's wrong what's good what's bad that made this country the place that people
[03:25:23.860 --> 03:25:30.260]  did want to come to because the population of this country for the most part believe me i know
[03:25:30.260 --> 03:25:38.980]  there's been lunatics and fringesists uh in america since its inception but overall when
[03:25:38.980 --> 03:25:49.540]  you think back to um america uh you think back to a time when there was a common thread through
[03:25:49.540 --> 03:25:57.620]  its people a pride there's a pride in your nation in in living in a place that is so amazing that
[03:25:57.620 --> 03:26:06.340]  people uh die trying to get here and that's what held it together that's what held the country
[03:26:06.340 --> 03:26:11.780]  together because no matter how different we are and when they talk about diversity it's our our
[03:26:11.780 --> 03:26:20.020]  differences but we need a common factor in there and that's what made us americans and that common
[03:26:20.020 --> 03:26:32.180]  factor was a basic value system and an ideology that we all held dear and when you look at a case
[03:26:32.180 --> 03:26:38.900]  like uh kate steinall and see that there is a portion of this country willing to throw all
[03:26:38.900 --> 03:26:47.620]  that away they don't want to be a part of the commonality and thread throughout the american
[03:26:47.620 --> 03:26:55.460]  people that made this country a a cohesive unit because no matter where you come from and what
[03:26:55.460 --> 03:27:01.860]  your culture is and what you brought from the land that you came from or that your ancestors
[03:27:01.860 --> 03:27:12.740]  came from to this country the one thing that that brought it all together that made us enjoy different
[03:27:12.740 --> 03:27:22.260]  foods and different uh interests and activities religions was that we were all doing it here in
[03:27:22.260 --> 03:27:28.660]  in this amazing country where we weren't supposed to be persecuted for those things and those ideas
[03:27:28.660 --> 03:27:36.500]  is where there was a distinction between good and bad and what you should be doing and shouldn't
[03:27:36.500 --> 03:27:45.860]  be doing in this country that is really going to the wayside and and that's the thing that people
[03:27:45.860 --> 03:27:53.220]  like myself and alex and so many other people that call themselves patriots and and to to the
[03:27:53.220 --> 03:27:59.540]  laughter of certain people when you say you're a patriot and you're proud of your country people
[03:27:59.540 --> 03:28:05.540]  laugh at that and joke about it while the whole thing seems to be swirling down the toilet
[03:28:07.300 --> 03:28:15.540]  uh it's because we have that we remember that we we enjoyed it i enjoy thinking back and when
[03:28:15.540 --> 03:28:21.300]  you say make america great again people laugh at that oh trump's little call sign no there was a
[03:28:21.300 --> 03:28:28.500]  greatness and it had nothing to do with race or white supremacy it had to do with that common
[03:28:28.500 --> 03:28:35.620]  thread that runs through us as americans and always has that ran through that that that makes you do
[03:28:35.620 --> 03:28:44.580]  things for the greater good americans and if we don't realize that very quickly uh we're doomed
[03:28:45.220 --> 03:28:49.780]  as a once great nation going to be back in a matter of moments don't go anywhere anthony come

[03:34:41.780 --> 03:34:47.620]  to everybody out there this is my last broadcast here until the new year uh so i want to talk a
[03:34:47.620 --> 03:34:56.340]  little bit about about christmas i was saying just before that break i get a bit nostalgic
[03:34:56.340 --> 03:35:03.700]  i think everybody does when you think of christmas it's one of those it's one of those times of the
[03:35:03.700 --> 03:35:13.700]  year when you reflect on your youth it was such a big part of of being a kid your parents family
[03:35:13.700 --> 03:35:21.620]  friends and you tend to remember all the good things when you think back and wax fantastic
[03:35:21.620 --> 03:35:29.380]  about days gone by but um i think it truly is one of those times a year where uh you do remember
[03:35:29.380 --> 03:35:38.900]  a lot of good things that that actually happened and i recall christmas back um i guess it was
[03:35:38.900 --> 03:35:47.460]  the 70s i could even remember people late 60s i do remember late 60s maybe first inklings of
[03:35:47.460 --> 03:35:55.220]  of thought process of your pal anthony was probably 67 68 i remember i remember things
[03:35:55.220 --> 03:36:02.740]  like the apollo program and um used to go to the gas station with my dad and uh they would give away
[03:36:02.740 --> 03:36:09.060]  they would give away these um little lunar modules that you'd put together like a little model and oh
[03:36:09.060 --> 03:36:15.620]  i loved that i loved the space program and the the pride it brought uh uh everyone here in the
[03:36:15.620 --> 03:36:22.180]  united states of america uh just those things from back then and and like i said before the break
[03:36:22.180 --> 03:36:28.500]  went when you say make america great again and people see hashtag maga and and you get this
[03:36:28.500 --> 03:36:39.540]  this uh people that laugh at it or call it racist or sexist oh you want to go back to this time when
[03:36:39.540 --> 03:36:48.820]  people didn't have rights and people were being beaten in the streets and the no no every country
[03:36:48.820 --> 03:36:58.900]  no matter how great it is has had a period of time that um uh people were being plagued by uh injustice
[03:37:00.420 --> 03:37:06.180]  doesn't matter how great the country was at the time there were always problems nothing's perfect
[03:37:06.900 --> 03:37:16.580]  and no no one is talking about making america great again by returning to uh uh injustices
[03:37:16.580 --> 03:37:26.100]  and and nightmares of of civil rights infringements and and whatnot no but when you say make america
[03:37:26.100 --> 03:37:33.220]  great again you're talking about a greatness of the people of this country and and what i i said
[03:37:33.220 --> 03:37:40.660]  before about a cohesive people not everyone's thinking the same but just having a common thread
[03:37:40.660 --> 03:37:48.900]  of of being american and being proud of being american and who you are your culture your background
[03:37:48.900 --> 03:37:56.100]  everything that that your ancestors brought here is part of what makes this country america
[03:37:57.380 --> 03:38:03.460]  and i'm thinking back at christmas and and i remember coming into new york city as a kid
[03:38:03.460 --> 03:38:13.220]  during christmas with my family and uh it was just an amazing thing the way the city is decorated
[03:38:13.220 --> 03:38:19.620]  and no matter how repulsive new york can be uh they're they're tended to be this niceness that
[03:38:19.620 --> 03:38:25.300]  went along with it uh people were in there from the suburbs just seeing what what new york city
[03:38:25.300 --> 03:38:30.340]  was like at christmas time very romantic it's been portrayed in so many movies and whatnot
[03:38:30.340 --> 03:38:38.340]  and then i walk around now and i i i try to weigh some of the differences
[03:38:39.620 --> 03:38:46.420]  because as you know christmas in certain parts of the country is a bad work it's not inclusive enough
[03:38:46.980 --> 03:38:55.940]  it's racist it's islamophobic it's so many terrible things uh and and as i say when i
[03:38:55.940 --> 03:39:01.300]  harken back to my youth i just remember it as being great being just an amazing time you're off
[03:39:01.300 --> 03:39:09.060]  of school you're gonna get presents uh your family is is is there there's a a little bit more uh
[03:39:09.060 --> 03:39:19.460]  niceness in the streets so walk around now and what do i say i see soldiers with automatic weapons
[03:39:19.460 --> 03:39:31.060]  it's i see cement barriers that are set up everywhere uh to protect people that are just
[03:39:31.060 --> 03:39:37.700]  trying to shop and and walk around and enjoy the sights and see the tree here and celebrate christmas
[03:39:39.140 --> 03:39:46.260]  signs everywhere see something say something uh there's there's an overhanging threat
[03:39:46.260 --> 03:39:54.820]  a black cloud hovering over christmas now everywhere and this is an exclusive to new york
[03:39:54.820 --> 03:40:04.900]  this is every city uh london uh you see these same barriers and look they paint them red and white
[03:40:05.460 --> 03:40:12.020]  like they're supposed to like they're supposed to be festive this is a constant reminder
[03:40:12.020 --> 03:40:22.740]  that there are people out there and cultures out there that want us dead and want our traditions
[03:40:23.460 --> 03:40:27.460]  wiped from the face of the earth including yes of course christmas
[03:40:29.300 --> 03:40:37.860]  uh there's people in this very country that sympathize with that that also want our traditions
[03:40:37.860 --> 03:40:48.580]  and cultures wiped away um when when when you used to come in to a big city and celebrate christmas
[03:40:48.580 --> 03:40:56.180]  at least like i said when i was a kid back in the late 60s early 70s uh you only thought about
[03:40:56.980 --> 03:41:04.180]  christmas and and how much fun it was and to walk around now and see the tree and the decorations
[03:41:04.180 --> 03:41:11.780]  and everything it seemed to be you still capture a little of that but when you see men walking around
[03:41:12.580 --> 03:41:18.340]  various branches of the military and the police forces walking around with automatic weapons
[03:41:18.340 --> 03:41:25.220]  it's a constant reminder and that's uh it's just a sad thing that we need to be constantly reminded
[03:41:25.220 --> 03:41:31.300]  even at this time of year that there are cultures that want to eliminate everything that we hold
[03:41:31.300 --> 03:41:39.380]  dear and that is a tradition there you go that's that's great and that's a a tradition
[03:41:40.900 --> 03:41:48.980]  to america that that that one of the many traditions that we built this country on
[03:41:49.860 --> 03:41:58.180]  and that separates us from other countries and other cultures uh you hear liberals constantly
[03:41:58.180 --> 03:42:08.420]  saying live and let live let's be tolerant we must accept this and that well why are traditional
[03:42:09.460 --> 03:42:18.100]  um american traditions the thing that can be sacrificed with impunity and and the second
[03:42:18.100 --> 03:42:25.300]  you start defending them you are either a racist or homophobic or islamophobic is something
[03:42:25.300 --> 03:42:34.100]  some kind of phobic orist when you're only defending traditions that you remember and that were great
[03:42:34.820 --> 03:42:42.340]  when i think back to this country the traditional christmas with your family going out on in the
[03:42:42.340 --> 03:42:48.900]  city and and seeing all the amazing things as a kid can we get back to that i have no idea be back

[03:49:07.700 --> 03:49:17.700]  our traditions it is amazing uh christmas is a holiday that is just fair game fair game for
[03:49:17.700 --> 03:49:25.540]  anyone any group that wants to trod upon it trounce it denounce it twist it and turn it
[03:49:26.100 --> 03:49:34.660]  till it's barely recognizable to the offense of people that hold it dear as a tradition to them
[03:49:34.660 --> 03:49:42.180]  but again people that celebrate christmas uh traditionally through through the liberal
[03:49:42.180 --> 03:49:49.860]  left what we've seen from progressives uh are the most intolerant people so intolerant yet they
[03:49:49.860 --> 03:49:57.140]  happen to be the most tolerant people ever because no one's rioting when when uh these people just
[03:49:57.140 --> 03:50:06.420]  trounce on on our traditions you don't see riots you don't see people murdering or beating people
[03:50:06.420 --> 03:50:12.740]  in the streets because we've uh we've been offended by some of these things i'm going to tell you a
[03:50:12.740 --> 03:50:21.620]  little story here and i want you to um to insert uh mohammed in here or islam or or any other religion
[03:50:21.620 --> 03:50:29.940]  really uh cnn was hyping a new children's book isn't that adorable a children's book about santa
[03:50:29.940 --> 03:50:39.540]  this is great right uh yeah uh we suppose there's supposed to be some sort of shock factor involved
[03:50:39.540 --> 03:50:48.180]  in learning there's a children's book called santa's husband in which santa is black and gay
[03:50:48.180 --> 03:50:55.140]  but frankly now that we're aware of it we'd be more surprised if there wasn't such a thing would we
[03:50:56.340 --> 03:51:04.180]  would we be more surprised if there wasn't such a thing as santa's husband where santa is black
[03:51:04.180 --> 03:51:22.180]  and gay um after seeing the gaitivity scene with two josephs the gaitivity scene why why why do they
[03:51:22.180 --> 03:51:33.700]  always pick these christianity whenever a group wants to crap all over a religion it will always
[03:51:33.700 --> 03:51:46.100]  be christianity and and the the traditional um holidays and services uh figures religious figures
[03:51:46.100 --> 03:51:57.780]  of christianity constantly they are able to make santa joseph gay change their race make them gay
[03:51:57.780 --> 03:52:03.860]  which would be an affront to oh my god could you imagine look i don't know if this is proper to
[03:52:03.860 --> 03:52:13.460]  say but just imagine you did homo hammond do you think that would fly do you think everyone
[03:52:13.460 --> 03:52:19.860]  involved with doing something like that would need to strap on kevlar to go to work every day
[03:52:19.860 --> 03:52:29.060]  unless they be gunned down or blown up i do i absolutely do you know why intolerance
[03:52:30.980 --> 03:52:37.700]  we talk about uh or the progressives talk about christianity and and christmas and all of the
[03:52:37.700 --> 03:52:46.340]  holidays pretty much and and our traditions and basic values of christianity as being intolerant
[03:52:46.340 --> 03:52:57.220]  yet when our religion and our culture and value system gets crapped on we just take it we literally
[03:52:57.220 --> 03:53:04.340]  turn the other cheek uh complain about it talk about it that is our right that is our right
[03:53:05.780 --> 03:53:11.380]  but do we take to the streets do we destroy property do we assault people do we murder
[03:53:11.380 --> 03:53:20.020]  people because of it no because we are tolerant it's another one of these crazy backward world
[03:53:20.020 --> 03:53:28.020]  things that go on when you talk about progressives it's um just a grave intolerance going on
[03:53:28.020 --> 03:53:34.420]  we all remember charlie hebdo oh boy were they in dutch when they tried to uh talk about islam
[03:53:34.420 --> 03:53:44.820]  yet christianity uh can just be used and abused by people the gaitivity scene i've never i've never
[03:53:44.820 --> 03:53:52.180]  heard of the gaitivity scene and now i'm just hearing about santa being gay and uh black there
[03:53:52.180 --> 03:53:59.860]  is that the gaitivity scene now any other religion using any other religious figures
[03:53:59.860 --> 03:54:10.820]  in this way i would i would say that that house would be in flames uh in no time but they're able
[03:54:10.820 --> 03:54:16.420]  to do this they practice their freedom of expression on their own property and they get
[03:54:16.980 --> 03:54:23.460]  complaints they get people like myself and other people in uh independent media that might um
[03:54:23.460 --> 03:54:30.820]  um criticize it but no one's going over there and kicking it over or throwing a uh molotov cocktail
[03:54:30.820 --> 03:54:38.100]  through their window because the the progressives version of the most intolerant people
[03:54:38.740 --> 03:54:46.580]  are the most tolerant people topsy turvy backward world that we live in i must talk quickly about
[03:54:46.580 --> 03:54:54.340]  rosy o'donnell the the giant gift that keeps giving rosy o'donnell she's lost her mind
[03:54:55.220 --> 03:55:01.460]  since trump even said he was running for president uh a few years back her and donald trump were in a
[03:55:01.460 --> 03:55:09.460]  bit of a battle uh when he was still with the apprentice and um she was so uh angry with donald
[03:55:09.460 --> 03:55:18.020]  trump's tax plan uh that looks like um it will come to fruition that she offered two senators
[03:55:18.980 --> 03:55:28.740]  two million dollars each to vote no on it to vote no this is a crime there it is she promises
[03:55:28.740 --> 03:55:34.580]  they have a two million to senator susan collins and two million to senator jake flake to vote no
[03:55:34.580 --> 03:55:44.180]  no on the tax bill two million dollars uh apparently this is against the 18 us code 201
[03:55:44.180 --> 03:55:51.700]  criminalizing the attempt of bribery of federal officials by uh whoever and apparently you will
[03:55:51.700 --> 03:56:01.060]  be fined three times the amount of the bribe so she could be fined 12 12 million dollars
[03:56:01.060 --> 03:56:11.860]  and uh go to prison uh for doing this she's insane much like the progressive left is is insane
[03:56:11.860 --> 03:56:17.220]  but i i i give her one pass and it's like my good friend michael malice said on my show yesterday
[03:56:18.020 --> 03:56:25.540]  think about it this is a guy that called her fat called her a slob said that uh if she doesn't
[03:56:25.540 --> 03:56:32.500]  watch her step he will take her girlfriend away and believe me i can do it trump said all these
[03:56:32.500 --> 03:56:42.260]  things hilarious hilarious that guy is now the president imagine somebody that is uh you have
[03:56:42.260 --> 03:56:48.980]  perceived as bullying you over over the years and calling you horrible things and not only do uh do
[03:56:48.980 --> 03:56:57.380]  they get away with it they become the leader of the free world so i almost give uh roseo donnell
[03:56:58.180 --> 03:57:07.700]  a pass on on her insanity um the rest of the left i i don't know what it is self-destructive
[03:57:07.700 --> 03:57:15.380]  personality uh what have you but uh i really do hope uh some branch of the judicial system goes
[03:57:15.380 --> 03:57:24.420]  after roseo donnell for offering millions of dollars in bribery to senators to vote no on a bill
[03:57:25.620 --> 03:57:34.420]  that a legally elected president and congress voted on she's out of her mind thank you very
