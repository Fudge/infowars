[00:00.000 --> 00:25.320]  Waging war on corruption is Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info
[00:25.320 --> 00:26.320]  War.
[00:26.320 --> 00:55.040]  We are 54 days out from the most historic election in world history that's universally
[00:55.040 --> 00:56.040]  accepted.
[00:56.040 --> 01:00.200]  Trump is 100% real, totally fighting to bring the country back.
[01:00.200 --> 01:04.480]  He has to walk a very fine line though because they think he can destroy confidence if we
[01:04.480 --> 01:08.800]  admit that we were basically in the final phases of being captured by the communist
[01:08.800 --> 01:13.800]  Chinese in a consortium with Goldman Sachs and others.
[01:13.800 --> 01:16.560]  Now, Trump has done what you do in a corporate takeover.
[01:16.560 --> 01:21.040]  They were taking us over in a corporate takeover, a hostile takeover.
[01:21.040 --> 01:26.440]  So he wants the equipment, he wants the whole operation, so he's taking it back over.
[01:26.440 --> 01:28.720]  People ask, well, why does he have Goldman Sachs in his administration?
[01:28.720 --> 01:33.040]  Because they know how things work, so he can tell them what to do.
[01:33.040 --> 01:38.760]  Just like if I was Lewis and Clark going out west and about to find a passage across the
[01:38.760 --> 01:46.160]  country by land, the first westerners to do that, I would go get the local native guides.
[01:46.160 --> 01:50.640]  Doesn't mean that I would agree with all of their customs or their policies, but that's
[01:50.640 --> 01:54.160]  where they famously said, Jones is insane.
[01:54.160 --> 01:58.560]  He believes goblins are real and that Trump is going to go into a goblin nest and kill
[01:58.560 --> 01:59.560]  them.
[01:59.560 --> 02:04.240]  Now, I said the allegory is if you were in Mordor in Middle Earth, that was a real place
[02:04.240 --> 02:09.160]  in some alternate dimension, and you had to go into Mordor and you wanted to go throw
[02:09.160 --> 02:15.000]  the ring of doom into the crack of doom, then what would you do?
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.400]  You would get one a guide like Smeagol or Gollum.
[02:18.400 --> 02:22.920]  Doesn't mean that you like Gollum, it doesn't mean that you kiss Gollum, doesn't mean that
[02:22.920 --> 02:24.480]  you marry Gollum.
[02:24.480 --> 02:29.680]  And so I said, we don't want to have Trump in bed with goblins.
[02:29.680 --> 02:32.200]  We don't want him to have sex with a goblin.
[02:32.200 --> 02:36.920]  And so that got watched like 40-something million views total because the media thought
[02:36.920 --> 02:39.360]  it was credited to me, but instead it was fine.
[02:39.360 --> 02:44.200]  And I got a massive audience from it of young people, but I'm digressing.
[02:44.200 --> 02:48.320]  The stress level, you can cut with a knife right now.
[02:48.320 --> 02:55.760]  I could almost not go on air today because of the magnitude and the stress and just how
[02:55.760 --> 02:56.880]  serious things are.
[02:56.880 --> 02:59.400]  Not for me.
[02:59.400 --> 03:02.400]  People keep asking how I can handle all these unprecedented attacks.
[03:02.400 --> 03:04.280]  Only Trump's been attacked more than I.
[03:04.280 --> 03:10.640]  It's now official because the globalists are evil and they're taking our country and our
[03:10.640 --> 03:11.640]  world over.
[03:11.640 --> 03:13.920]  It's the only chance we've got.
[03:13.920 --> 03:18.480]  And I've used this analogy many times, there have been famous cases where people weren't
[03:18.480 --> 03:24.040]  even good swimmers, but a big ship had tumped over and they had to swim 50, 100 yards in
[03:24.040 --> 03:27.200]  total darkness to get out and people are able to do it.
[03:27.200 --> 03:31.160]  Just like those kids that never been scuba diving in the mine collapse that happened
[03:31.160 --> 03:36.200]  a few months ago and they got a crash course in it and they made it out.
[03:36.200 --> 03:37.200]  It's not courage.
[03:37.200 --> 03:42.160]  I am desperately trying to not be a slave.
[03:42.160 --> 03:45.800]  I would not be fighting tooth and nail at my own personal risk if we were just being
[03:45.800 --> 03:49.240]  taken over by some superior capitalist system.
[03:49.240 --> 03:53.760]  I would simply try to be part of that.
[03:53.760 --> 03:55.480]  I'm all about adopting things.
[03:55.480 --> 03:59.600]  I'm all about things that are better marrying them.
[03:59.600 --> 04:02.440]  That's what you do.
[04:02.440 --> 04:07.200]  I don't want to be at war with everybody, but the globalists are really nasty devil-worshipping
[04:07.200 --> 04:09.200]  blood-drinking pedophiles.
[04:09.200 --> 04:16.920]  You know you shit all over the news, oh, children's blood goes for $18,000 a court.
[04:16.920 --> 04:18.080]  That's mainstream news this week.
[04:18.080 --> 04:20.760]  I told you that 20 years ago.
[04:20.760 --> 04:21.760]  It's in the medical literature.
[04:21.760 --> 04:28.040]  I know rich people here in town that told me, it's 10 years ago, I ought to go get children's
[04:28.040 --> 04:31.080]  blood.
[04:31.080 --> 04:36.560]  I know people that do it, so don't tell me.
[04:36.560 --> 04:41.200]  I know, and that's why they hate me, because the globalists do it, and they go, this guy
[04:41.200 --> 04:43.280]  has got our number.
[04:43.280 --> 04:48.520]  So, the ultramassive news straight ahead, I haven't even told you what it is yet.
[04:48.520 --> 04:53.080]  I saw the Shesh Day, it's not getting attention deserves, it's on Infowars.com, and it is
[04:53.080 --> 04:58.080]  thousands of armed men in camouflage coming across the U.S. on horseback.
[04:58.080 --> 05:00.560]  This is an invasion.

[06:16.600 --> 06:34.360]  Deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide its Alex Jones.
[06:34.360 --> 06:42.760]  Owen Schreuer is going to be in studio with us in the second hour.
[06:42.760 --> 06:56.400]  I had seen the article from the Daily Caller yesterday afternoon, but I hadn't watched
[06:56.400 --> 07:08.840]  the video, and then last night I saw that Owen had done a live feed on his Facebook going
[07:08.840 --> 07:13.840]  to one of these local churches that the Democrats have taken over and turned into a U.N. invasion
[07:13.840 --> 07:14.840]  base.
[07:14.840 --> 07:17.360]  Literally, that's who funds it and runs it with George Soros.
[07:17.360 --> 07:18.360]  It's all public.
[07:18.360 --> 07:20.960]  You can't make this stuff up.
[07:20.960 --> 07:31.280]  And Owen confronted them about thousands of armed men in camouflage, many on horseback
[07:31.280 --> 07:37.080]  armed with assault rifles entering the United States.
[07:37.080 --> 07:44.800]  Now, if you understand that the border in Arizona and in Texas is about 80% Hispanic,
[07:44.800 --> 07:49.520]  and they're American citizens, and they're the folks begging for walls.
[07:49.520 --> 07:52.280]  When I was a child, we got out of the border, and it was romantic.
[07:52.280 --> 07:53.440]  It was safe.
[07:53.440 --> 07:55.040]  It was fun.
[07:55.040 --> 07:56.040]  The food was great.
[07:56.040 --> 07:57.080]  We go into Mexico.
[07:57.080 --> 08:01.080]  You might worry about getting pickpocketed, but that was it.
[08:01.080 --> 08:05.920]  There are hundreds of thousands dead now along the Texas border all the way through Arizona,
[08:05.920 --> 08:10.680]  all the way into California on the 2,000 miles.
[08:10.680 --> 08:15.680]  And you've got men in this video, and there's video, it goes on for hours and hours, thousands
[08:15.680 --> 08:23.120]  of them in camouflage carrying large square rucksacks on their back.
[08:23.120 --> 08:27.040]  Now we know what's in it because there's two types.
[08:27.040 --> 08:30.760]  Those are marijuana rucksacks.
[08:30.760 --> 08:36.600]  Over the crew a few years ago, during the campaign, famously got footage down in Brownsville
[08:36.600 --> 08:43.560]  of large containers of drugs coming across, being put in the back of a vehicle, and then
[08:43.560 --> 08:47.520]  the folks run back across and jump in the river and swim back.
[08:47.520 --> 08:50.520]  Those are called mules.
[08:50.520 --> 08:51.920]  They are the drug shippers.
[08:51.920 --> 08:54.000]  The media said it was a conspiracy theory.
[08:54.000 --> 09:04.000]  The Trump was wrong when he talked about our video that it did not exist.
[09:04.000 --> 09:14.200]  So we have hundreds of thousands dead on the U.S.-Mexico border.
[09:14.200 --> 09:21.000]  It is rated the most dangerous country on earth year in, year out.
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.280]  And it loses to Guatemala.
[09:25.280 --> 09:29.080]  South Africa is now on the top 10.
[09:29.080 --> 09:37.440]  Hundreds of thousands missing, hundreds of thousands dead, many of them women and children,
[09:37.440 --> 09:41.800]  and they're killed by the cartels and the psychopaths and the criminals that haunt that
[09:41.800 --> 09:42.800]  area.
[09:42.800 --> 09:47.880]  But again, you turn on the news, you hear about crying children, many of which come
[09:47.880 --> 09:55.320]  across by themselves, you bet they don't just put them with other adults in a facility.
[09:55.320 --> 09:59.800]  That started decades ago when the ACLU filed lawsuits and what they should have, you shouldn't
[09:59.800 --> 10:03.880]  be putting 10, 12-year-old kids, you don't know they're identities, in with adults in
[10:03.880 --> 10:09.080]  general area, in a warehouse.
[10:09.080 --> 10:10.080]  But that's how they lie.
[10:10.080 --> 10:15.560]  They make a big deal out of what's already going on on a collapsed road warrior border
[10:15.560 --> 10:19.240]  that is more dangerous than anything out of road warrior.
[10:19.240 --> 10:23.040]  It is literally road warrior.
[10:23.040 --> 10:28.440]  Type in cartels building their own war wagons and tanks, and there is footage that comes
[10:28.440 --> 10:29.440]  out of Mexico.
[10:29.440 --> 10:31.840]  YouTube takes it down, though, because they don't want you seeing it.
[10:31.840 --> 10:33.600]  Not that it's even violent.
[10:33.600 --> 10:37.640]  It is violent, but it's not as graphic as what's on TV.
[10:37.640 --> 10:41.800]  And it's giant war wagons shooting at each other, attacking, blowing up, running over
[10:41.800 --> 10:47.920]  people, and you'll see like 15 war wagons and 50 cow machine guns and stuff exploding,
[10:47.920 --> 10:49.400]  and people just running.
[10:49.400 --> 10:56.880]  Now, there it is, seven incredible narco tanks built by Mexican cartels beyond Mad Max as
[10:56.880 --> 10:58.520]  Business Insider.
[10:58.520 --> 11:00.480]  See?
[11:00.480 --> 11:01.960]  Exactly what I told you.
[11:01.960 --> 11:08.760]  It is road warrior, except it's not a guy named Humongous going, just give us the gas,
[11:08.760 --> 11:11.080]  we spare your lives.
[11:11.080 --> 11:12.800]  He's not wearing a Jason mask.
[11:12.800 --> 11:17.320]  It's not a bunch of gay punk rock dudes that are doing a killing, you know, in that sci-fi
[11:17.320 --> 11:21.720]  fiction.
[11:21.720 --> 11:28.880]  It is Mexicans with huge satanic tattoos that worship Satan and the Grim Reaper, an MS-13
[11:28.880 --> 11:32.560]  that tortures children to get demonic power.
[11:32.560 --> 11:35.760]  Imagine a road warrior like that.
[11:35.760 --> 11:46.000]  Yeah, 200,000 dead giant 18-wheeler war wagons.
[11:46.000 --> 11:47.000]  That's what's going on.
[11:47.000 --> 11:53.480]  Hundreds of billions of dollars pouring through, burnout vehicles everywhere, and then they
[11:53.480 --> 11:59.480]  tell the naive American people and the naive leftist, and we are naive folks of what's
[11:59.480 --> 12:00.480]  on that border.
[12:00.480 --> 12:01.480]  I'm not.
[12:01.480 --> 12:04.720]  I live here.
[12:04.720 --> 12:07.120]  They say, oh, we're being mean.
[12:07.120 --> 12:11.880]  Everyone's fleeing, scared to death to get up here.
[12:11.880 --> 12:16.200]  So, I've never seen footage this powerful.
[12:16.200 --> 12:17.880]  It's up on infowars.com.
[12:17.880 --> 12:20.000]  We can't tweet it out, but you can.
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.800]  Heavily armed individuals caught on camera entering country illegally through Arizona
[12:25.800 --> 12:26.800]  Ranch.
[12:26.800 --> 12:33.440]  And it goes on to say, shows thousands of illegal aliens marching in the United States,
[12:33.440 --> 12:38.320]  uninterrupted because there is no border wall, no border patrol to stop them.
[12:38.320 --> 12:45.560]  And they have assault rifles and they have horses.
[12:45.560 --> 12:52.400]  So it's like road warrior meets planet of the age where you've got people on horseback.
[12:52.400 --> 13:00.840]  This is insane.
[13:00.840 --> 13:05.840]  So this is industrial level drugs being brought across, and that's your passage.
[13:05.840 --> 13:08.600]  You pay them a certain amount of money, a lot of them are Central or South American or
[13:08.600 --> 13:09.600]  from other countries.
[13:09.600 --> 13:12.640]  Now, it's something like 15% or other than Mexican.
[13:12.640 --> 13:18.360]  They used to always, you have to have different terms, they used to always be mainly Mexicans.
[13:18.360 --> 13:20.280]  Now it's Chinese, you name it.
[13:20.280 --> 13:28.640]  And they're coming across and part of their pay is to carry the rucksack of marijuana or
[13:28.640 --> 13:31.000]  cocaine on their back.
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.720]  And again, there's hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of
[13:34.720 --> 13:37.840]  footage release of thousands of men.
[13:37.840 --> 13:41.440]  You see those boxes?
[13:41.440 --> 13:45.160]  The bags, the rucksacks are generally marijuana.
[13:45.160 --> 13:56.760]  The boxes are cocaine or heroin, black tar Mexican heroin.
[13:56.760 --> 14:05.680]  So video footage from Arizona shows illegals, thousands of them marching in the United States
[14:05.680 --> 14:13.040]  uninterrupted because there is no border wall.
[14:13.040 --> 14:20.520]  Jim Chilton 79 owns a 50,000 acre rant situated on the US Mexico border, which has become
[14:20.520 --> 14:22.960]  a hotspot for illegals crossing into the country.
[14:22.960 --> 14:27.080]  And again, it's a bunch of scrub brush, but go out there, he's real rich, 50,000 acres
[14:27.080 --> 14:28.080]  of care, right?
[14:28.080 --> 14:32.680]  Can't even hardly put 5,000 cows on that.
[14:32.680 --> 14:38.920]  Security camera footage from a, recently a 2018 shows individuals in camouflage toting
[14:38.920 --> 14:46.880]  large backpacks and in some cases, what appears to be military style assault rifles walking
[14:46.880 --> 14:51.800]  to his ranch into the state's incident free.
[14:51.800 --> 14:55.680]  They even attached a military style assault rifles to horses.
[14:55.680 --> 14:59.560]  This is 2018 and this has been going on for a while.
[14:59.560 --> 15:02.480]  And then the left sits there.
[15:02.480 --> 15:04.000]  They want our guns as citizens.
[15:04.000 --> 15:05.800]  They want us disarmed.
[15:05.800 --> 15:06.800]  They want to control our children.
[15:06.800 --> 15:08.920]  They want to run our lives.
[15:08.920 --> 15:14.280]  And then if we try to have any border at all, they say we're the most horrible, worst people.
[15:14.280 --> 15:15.280]  We're racist.
[15:15.280 --> 15:16.280]  It goes on and on.
[15:16.280 --> 15:24.360]  The UN now stages in Guatemala and in Nicaragua and El Salvador, three giant migrant centers
[15:24.360 --> 15:32.160]  for all over the world to give them several thousand dollars apiece, a bag of food and
[15:32.160 --> 15:37.280]  other necessities, clothing, you name it, and then staging zones and the Mexicans let
[15:37.280 --> 15:38.720]  them go up the railways.
[15:38.720 --> 15:41.160]  They say don't go into Mexico.
[15:41.160 --> 15:46.880]  And then they hit the U.S. with the Democratic groups waiting to snatch them up to be a client
[15:46.880 --> 15:50.320]  group they control for illegal voting, political activities.
[15:50.320 --> 15:55.400]  And now MS-13 has been confirmed to be carrying out assassinations for the Democratic Party.
[15:55.400 --> 15:56.400]  That's right.
[15:56.400 --> 15:59.280]  MS-13 is now a murder arm of the Democrats.
[15:59.280 --> 16:03.400]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists, get back to nature.

[18:00.280 --> 18:05.600]  AlphaWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[18:05.600 --> 18:11.080]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:11.080 --> 18:17.600]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:17.600 --> 18:23.480]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.480 --> 18:26.800]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.800 --> 18:31.560]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[18:31.560 --> 18:36.800]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:36.800 --> 18:37.800]  symptoms.
[18:37.800 --> 18:40.480]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[18:40.480 --> 18:41.480]  It is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.480 --> 18:46.400]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.400 --> 18:52.200]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.200 --> 18:54.920]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:54.920 --> 19:00.360]  Visit infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[19:00.360 --> 19:02.680]  InfoWarsLife is launching its newest product.

[19:51.680 --> 19:55.080]  We sold it at 50% off till it's sold out.
[19:55.080 --> 19:57.560]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.

[20:03.560 --> 20:21.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:21.680 --> 20:27.960]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas,
[20:27.960 --> 20:35.240]  Alex Jones.
[20:35.240 --> 20:38.080]  But we are taking our country back.
[20:38.080 --> 20:42.080]  If Trump is successful, if we're successful in a few years, we'll be able to say coming
[20:42.080 --> 20:45.040]  to you from the recaptured United States of America.
[20:45.040 --> 20:50.680]  But the big fight you see in the incredible lies and the weaponized media is because we
[20:50.680 --> 20:56.200]  are facing a foreign, globalist, corporate, combined ally with China, the authoritarian
[20:56.200 --> 20:59.440]  EU and the traders in Hollywood.
[20:59.440 --> 21:01.160]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[21:01.160 --> 21:02.560]  It's in the documents.
[21:02.560 --> 21:05.920]  This is like a James Bond movie.
[21:05.920 --> 21:08.640]  The globalists are like Spectre.
[21:08.640 --> 21:17.040]  Now, there is dramatic video at InfoWars.com.
[21:17.040 --> 21:20.080]  We're going to show some of you right now, your TV viewer, but radio listeners must see
[21:20.080 --> 21:33.720]  this, of thousands of camouflaged men armed with assault rifles and many on horseback
[21:33.720 --> 21:36.560]  flooding into the United States.
[21:36.560 --> 21:41.960]  And this is at one ranch in Arizona.
[21:41.960 --> 21:43.840]  It's even worse in Texas.
[21:43.840 --> 21:44.960]  Most people have pulled out.
[21:44.960 --> 21:48.160]  You try to go ride your jet ski on a lake bordering Mexico.
[21:48.160 --> 21:53.680]  You get shot in the head with a sniper rifle, an illegal alien shoots your daughter in the
[21:53.680 --> 21:54.800]  back in San Francisco.
[21:54.800 --> 21:56.960]  The jury lets them go.
[21:56.960 --> 22:03.000]  The media made fun of the widow who saw her husband shot on the jet ski because you cannot
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.360]  humanize the people that are being killed.
[22:06.360 --> 22:11.400]  Mexico has collapsed into a road warrior scenario.
[22:11.400 --> 22:21.840]  So what do you do when you're the Democrats and you have a undefensible, indefensible
[22:21.840 --> 22:26.000]  argument of a collapsed third world country, Mexico, most of it under martial law, hundreds
[22:26.000 --> 22:27.800]  of thousands dead, pouring in.
[22:27.800 --> 22:32.640]  You don't know who's who, 70 some percent of the people under 18 are unaccompanied by
[22:32.640 --> 22:33.640]  any family.
[22:33.640 --> 22:39.960]  You don't know who they are and we're supposed to stick them in general population.
[22:39.960 --> 22:41.960]  So what do they do?
[22:41.960 --> 22:42.960]  They go, oh, the children, you're hurting the children.
[22:42.960 --> 22:44.080]  This little girl, you took her from her mommy.
[22:44.080 --> 22:45.080]  That was a lie, too.
[22:45.080 --> 22:46.360]  She was never taken from her mother.
[22:46.360 --> 22:51.040]  It's all lies.
[22:51.040 --> 22:56.040]  And what do they do when Trump tries to secure the border?
[22:56.040 --> 22:57.840]  They say there's no violence down there.
[22:57.840 --> 22:58.840]  Everything's fine.
[22:58.840 --> 22:59.840]  We have no need.
[22:59.840 --> 23:02.880]  Well, then why we have security at airports?
[23:02.880 --> 23:05.240]  They haven't stopped one terror attack with all that TSA crud.
[23:05.240 --> 23:08.240]  They need to profile Islamic extremists, period.
[23:08.240 --> 23:15.440]  And solve, oh, they, they profile conservatives, Facebook and all these systems discriminate
[23:15.440 --> 23:17.400]  against us.
[23:17.400 --> 23:19.120]  You're part of a radical sect of Islam.
[23:19.120 --> 23:20.120]  You're connected to these groups.
[23:20.120 --> 23:22.360]  It goes to that database and flags.
[23:22.360 --> 23:26.360]  You're but you're going to get pulled out and you're going to get questioned.
[23:26.360 --> 23:27.800]  You're going to get extra screening.
[23:27.800 --> 23:28.800]  That's what you do.
[23:28.800 --> 23:37.720]  You know, if you've been convicted of robbing a bank and a bank gets robbed by somebody in
[23:37.720 --> 23:41.480]  the L.A. that fits your description and you're trying to fly out with a big duffel bag the
[23:41.480 --> 23:45.720]  next day, we got a probable cause to drag your ass out of there.
[23:45.720 --> 23:47.720]  I don't care if you're white, black or polka-dotted.
[23:47.720 --> 23:52.040]  Oh, but Islam is a religion to peace.
[23:52.040 --> 23:54.040]  So that's what's happening on the border.
[23:54.040 --> 23:58.680]  It's collapsed and they changed the subject by screaming, you're being mean to children.
[23:58.680 --> 24:04.040]  Or how dare you control people and, uh, you know, not want to have a border that, that
[24:04.040 --> 24:05.040]  checks anything.
[24:05.040 --> 24:09.400]  And I was thinking about Trump when he said, a lot of great people from Mexico, a lot of
[24:09.400 --> 24:12.680]  great folks coming in, but we want them if they're good and got a good background, aren't
[24:12.680 --> 24:13.680]  criminals fine?
[24:13.680 --> 24:16.880]  But there's also a lot of criminals, a lot of rapists, a lot of murderers coming across.
[24:16.880 --> 24:21.920]  That turns into Trump calls all Mexicans, murderers and rapists.
[24:21.920 --> 24:22.920]  That is total deception.
[24:22.920 --> 24:24.480]  And that's what they do to me and you.
[24:24.480 --> 24:25.880]  They lie about you all day.
[24:25.880 --> 24:27.160]  These people are sick.
[24:27.160 --> 24:32.240]  So I was thinking just this morning about Trump when I watched this video again, it just came
[24:32.240 --> 24:33.240]  out.
[24:33.240 --> 24:35.280]  It should have been worse what he said.
[24:35.280 --> 24:40.720]  He should have said Mexico has collapsed in most areas, hundreds of thousands dead.
[24:40.720 --> 24:42.720]  It's a failed narco terror state.
[24:42.720 --> 24:45.280]  We are in a red alert emergency.
[24:45.280 --> 24:49.040]  We need to defend that border right now.
[24:49.040 --> 24:52.400]  In fact, I'll say it.
[24:52.400 --> 24:54.240]  Apprehensions of illegals are up 240%.
[24:54.240 --> 24:57.080]  According to ICE, it isn't enough.
[24:57.080 --> 25:01.080]  Trump is in dereliction of duty two years and he's not enough.
[25:01.080 --> 25:04.240]  I want, and it's in the Constitution, full military.
[25:04.240 --> 25:05.240]  I want the army.
[25:05.240 --> 25:06.240]  I want the Marine Corps.
[25:06.240 --> 25:09.880]  I want 200,000 troops on that border.
[25:09.880 --> 25:15.760]  I want it shut down 1 million percent.
[25:15.760 --> 25:17.600]  All of Latin America is collapsing.
[25:17.600 --> 25:23.480]  They're building walls with razor wire all around Venezuela because Venezuela is collapsing
[25:23.480 --> 25:26.400]  into the surrounding countries.
[25:26.400 --> 25:29.240]  You let one of these third world countries collapse into you.
[25:29.240 --> 25:30.240]  You go bankrupt.
[25:30.240 --> 25:34.680]  Oh, I forgot.
[25:34.680 --> 25:39.240]  What's George Soros want?
[25:39.240 --> 25:42.480]  Before he spent tens of billions of dollars buying up the media in the U.S. and buying
[25:42.480 --> 25:46.840]  PR for himself, when I was a young man, when I was a kid and when I was in high school,
[25:46.840 --> 25:50.000]  my mom always had PBS on cooking dinner.
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.280]  Whenever I came home at football or whatever, she was always there at five, six o'clock
[25:54.280 --> 26:03.400]  for like an hour and a half cooking a huge, you know, six-dish meal, gourmet food.
[26:03.400 --> 26:08.880]  So I showed up for dinner a lot of times, bring my girlfriend over.
[26:08.880 --> 26:15.600]  And it was always on PBS and ABC and everywhere that George Soros is a criminal.
[26:15.600 --> 26:17.200]  He overthrows countries.
[26:17.200 --> 26:22.160]  All he wants to do is collapse things and he's an insider trader, not anymore.
[26:22.160 --> 26:24.320]  He's the sweet little Nazi collaborator.
[26:24.320 --> 26:26.640]  He almost kisses a little war-covered booty.
[26:26.640 --> 26:30.400]  So think about the fantasticness of this.
[26:30.400 --> 26:36.840]  In one ranch, thousands of men in camouflage, many on horseback with assault rifles, just
[26:36.840 --> 26:44.800]  unimpeded, constantly coming in, rapes, murders, severed heads, all sorts of horrible garbage,
[26:44.800 --> 26:52.240]  white bodies buried all over the place, and then they say, oh, racist America, open your
[26:52.240 --> 26:53.240]  borders.
[26:53.240 --> 26:54.240]  Oh, mean to the children.
[26:54.240 --> 26:55.240]  None of it's true.
[26:55.240 --> 26:59.520]  Think about how outrageous that is.
[26:59.520 --> 27:04.800]  How surreal it is that they use our Christian charity as deep-down Americans, the most
[27:04.800 --> 27:08.720]  open country in the world, where you can come here illegally and have your child and we'll
[27:08.720 --> 27:10.640]  make them a citizen and pay for everything.
[27:10.640 --> 27:12.360]  We shouldn't do that.
[27:12.360 --> 27:13.360]  Nobody else does that.
[27:13.360 --> 27:16.640]  And the whole world thinks of us as a joke.
[27:16.640 --> 27:19.240]  You go to China, there isn't no such thing as welfare.
[27:19.240 --> 27:21.400]  Because they're communists.
[27:21.400 --> 27:23.080]  The liberals always think they bring in communism.
[27:23.080 --> 27:24.080]  They get welfare.
[27:24.080 --> 27:27.600]  No, no, no, you get slavery.
[27:27.600 --> 27:29.440]  You try to do anything the left does here.
[27:29.440 --> 27:30.440]  They kill you.
[27:30.440 --> 27:37.040]  If you're gay and you get caught, they take you and they blow your head off at a sports
[27:37.040 --> 27:38.040]  stadium.
[27:38.040 --> 27:42.400]  So about five years ago, that was all on Google.
[27:42.400 --> 27:43.880]  People took it all off.
[27:43.880 --> 27:48.240]  You could go to Google and type in Chinese executions and it'd all be there.
[27:48.240 --> 27:51.600]  Sports stadiums on Saturday and Sunday for hours.
[27:51.600 --> 27:58.360]  It's like the entertainment and everyone just comes and watches people hung and shot.
[27:58.360 --> 28:06.680]  And you can see there was one photo of two lesbians, two 16-year-old girls that got caught
[28:06.680 --> 28:13.560]  in their dorm area having sex and they took them out and they blew their brains all over
[28:13.560 --> 28:14.560]  the walls.
[28:14.560 --> 28:17.080]  You want to see those photos?
[28:17.080 --> 28:18.880]  Type it in.
[28:18.880 --> 28:21.680]  But Tim cooks gay so it's okay.
[28:21.680 --> 28:24.560]  It's so liberal to blow women's brains all over the wall.
[28:24.560 --> 28:27.880]  If you're liberal and you're gay, then it's good.
[28:27.880 --> 28:32.400]  And the homophobe Alex Jones hates gay people because he doesn't blow their brains all over
[28:32.400 --> 28:33.400]  the wall.
[28:33.400 --> 28:37.800]  And he's not a Nazi collaborator like George Soros.
[28:37.800 --> 28:43.600]  They got sick that ish, they got evil that ish and now our border is totally wide open.
[28:43.600 --> 28:47.080]  Now we've got huge news that Tucker Carlson will be covering tonight, by the way.
[28:47.080 --> 28:48.080]  That's right.
[28:48.080 --> 28:50.440]  We've got the man that created the walk away campaign.
[28:50.440 --> 28:53.640]  He mentioned info wars and was banned on Facebook.
[28:53.640 --> 29:00.520]  Oh yes, the word police are here.
[29:00.520 --> 29:02.200]  Let's talk tough.
[29:02.200 --> 29:03.600]  Let's talk comfort.
[29:03.600 --> 29:11.080]  Let's talk about down home value made in the USA blue jeans like you wore as a kid.
[29:11.080 --> 29:12.080]  Remember?
[29:12.080 --> 29:20.280]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[32:00.480 --> 32:04.320]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[32:04.320 --> 32:08.840]  The real drama can be found here in Lelani estates, but a lot of us on the big island
[32:08.840 --> 32:14.280]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[32:14.280 --> 32:19.680]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[32:19.680 --> 32:21.200]  to unhealthy levels.
[32:21.200 --> 32:27.720]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[32:27.720 --> 32:31.680]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[32:31.680 --> 32:33.080]  in the rainwater.
[32:33.080 --> 32:38.400]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[32:38.400 --> 32:44.480]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[32:44.480 --> 32:50.120]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[32:50.120 --> 32:55.440]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[32:55.440 --> 33:03.000]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[33:03.000 --> 33:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:08.000 --> 33:16.800]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover us.
[33:16.800 --> 33:23.520]  You want to stop tyranny will so does he live from the info wars.com studios.
[33:23.520 --> 33:29.120]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:29.120 --> 33:38.040]  I have been a busy beaver and I have been talking to a lot of folks very close to the
[33:38.040 --> 33:45.880]  president, very close to the president, but as close as you can get and Trump's going
[33:45.880 --> 33:50.680]  to move on big tech very, very soon and he needs to move very, very fast.
[33:50.680 --> 33:53.840]  And it's just as I was told by other sources that are high level, but not as high level
[33:53.840 --> 34:02.800]  as this source, these sources that Trump is being blocked and is being sabotaged by the
[34:02.800 --> 34:08.480]  Justice Department and the Democrats inside there in the deep status and that they are
[34:08.480 --> 34:11.280]  trying to stop him from moving against big tech censorship.
[34:11.280 --> 34:13.160]  They have a total arsenal.
[34:13.160 --> 34:18.800]  It's election meddling, it's in kind donations to the Democrats to block all the conservatives.
[34:18.800 --> 34:22.920]  We have them blocking Republicans being able to tweet out to their constituents, but the
[34:22.920 --> 34:29.160]  Democrats are all being given full power, pedal to the metal, leaked video, Google leadership
[34:29.160 --> 34:32.080]  dismayed reaction to Trump's election.
[34:32.080 --> 34:35.720]  Now there's video release of them swearing that they'll defeat the Republicans next time
[34:35.720 --> 34:41.480]  by taking full control of the public discourse and using information warfare.
[34:41.480 --> 34:46.200]  There's hours of this video and by the way, more is going to come out.
[34:46.200 --> 34:49.660]  See, a lot of people don't want to bring this out because they don't want to damage these
[34:49.660 --> 34:56.320]  institutions too bad, but the decision is about to be made to go ahead and start bringing
[34:56.320 --> 34:58.320]  out the big, big dirt.
[34:58.320 --> 35:03.280]  So if you think that Google is not going to work with the Pentagon or Congress or the
[35:03.280 --> 35:08.160]  American people and then build AI for the Communist Chinese, then I think coming, do
[35:08.160 --> 35:10.160]  we have our guests yet?
[35:10.160 --> 35:11.680]  Okay, great.
[35:11.680 --> 35:14.360]  We're going to go to him here in just a moment then.
[35:14.360 --> 35:21.440]  And the reason I mention this is this country is in a battle for its life and the planet
[35:21.440 --> 35:25.480]  wants to be run by the mega banks and the chai comms who are totally ruthless.
[35:25.480 --> 35:29.560]  And again, line up lesbians and blow their heads off as we just showed you Chinese executions
[35:29.560 --> 35:35.600]  of gays, then by all means before it, I just don't know how I get called homophobic and
[35:35.600 --> 35:41.600]  all this made up crap when I say you should not have people sexualizing kids, period.
[35:41.600 --> 35:47.160]  And they have the LGBT groups saying I'm a homophobe when it's Apple working with China
[35:47.160 --> 35:49.520]  that literally murders gay people.
[35:49.520 --> 35:52.200]  And I'm not saying that because our next guest is gay.
[35:52.200 --> 35:57.200]  It's a fact of his insane hypocrisy.
[35:57.200 --> 35:58.200]  It drives me crazy.
[35:58.200 --> 36:01.840]  Sorry, we go to our guest here in a moment.
[36:01.840 --> 36:07.920]  But man, heavily armed individuals caught on camera entering country illegally through
[36:07.920 --> 36:08.920]  Arizona.
[36:08.920 --> 36:09.920]  We'll get more into that.
[36:09.920 --> 36:13.920]  We'll get into the leaked video, Google leadership dismayed reaction to Trump election.
[36:13.920 --> 36:15.400]  And then all there's hours of this.
[36:15.400 --> 36:16.400]  It's incredible.
[36:16.400 --> 36:22.800]  This is the leaders of Google, like a bunch of little wimps crying, shocking information
[36:22.800 --> 36:23.800]  exclusive.
[36:23.800 --> 36:28.720]  Jim Jordan on leaked Google video, anti-conservative bias rampant across Silicon Valley vows to
[36:28.720 --> 36:29.720]  take action.
[36:29.720 --> 36:31.920]  You just passed a law banning memes.
[36:31.920 --> 36:32.920]  I'm not kidding.
[36:32.920 --> 36:34.800]  Just even sending them.
[36:34.800 --> 36:39.920]  So that's all coming up.
[36:39.920 --> 36:42.360]  And again, we're going to be going to Brandon Strock here in a moment.
[36:42.360 --> 36:47.560]  His Skype has been cutting in and out and he just got frozen for 30 days on Facebook
[36:47.560 --> 36:51.520]  for saying, hey, Patriots, I'm about to go on info wars.
[36:51.520 --> 36:54.800]  And again, they're trying to tell you what you can and can't read what you can and can't
[36:54.800 --> 36:55.800]  see.
[36:55.800 --> 36:59.200]  And big tech because they have a monopoly believes that they can get past the Streisand
[36:59.200 --> 37:00.200]  effect.
[37:00.200 --> 37:09.040]  This is a big test of that now.
[37:09.040 --> 37:14.520]  Let me tell you something that's very important while we're getting our guest on.
[37:14.520 --> 37:16.640]  And it's this.
[37:16.640 --> 37:27.520]  Just like our information here on air is world changing.
[37:27.520 --> 37:37.880]  Just like our information is powerful.
[37:37.880 --> 37:41.280]  Our products are the same.
[37:41.280 --> 37:52.720]  And you know, I don't just sit here and tell you that I can't gather my company, excuse
[37:52.720 --> 37:53.720]  me.
[37:53.720 --> 38:01.560]  There's a lot of stuff going on here before the scenes now.
[38:01.560 --> 38:07.760]  Just like our information is game changing.
[38:07.760 --> 38:10.240]  Our products are game changing.
[38:10.240 --> 38:12.600]  If you don't have oxygen, you die.
[38:12.600 --> 38:14.320]  I know they'll say that's a conspiracy theory.
[38:14.320 --> 38:19.160]  If you don't have water, you'll die in a week, generally.
[38:19.160 --> 38:24.440]  If you don't have iodine, you die.
[38:24.440 --> 38:27.840]  If you don't have vitamin C, you die.
[38:27.840 --> 38:33.760]  Now, vitamin C is very abundant and very plentiful and very easy to get.
[38:33.760 --> 38:38.280]  Iodine in the environment isn't and it's bound to other things when you get it from
[38:38.280 --> 38:40.320]  seaweed or you get it in salt.
[38:40.320 --> 38:46.040]  It's not with X2.
[38:46.040 --> 38:59.320]  It is in palm oil solution and it's put in a gaseous form in a patented system.
[38:59.320 --> 39:05.720]  And then what it does in the body is something you got experience for yourself.
[39:05.720 --> 39:11.160]  You need to experience it and read the thousands of five-star reviews, 98% on power reviews,
[39:11.160 --> 39:17.800]  97% on other major sites, 6,000-plus reviews, 4.9 stars.
[39:17.800 --> 39:18.800]  Experience it.
[39:18.800 --> 39:20.720]  It's unlike any other iodine out there.
[39:20.720 --> 39:23.320]  It doesn't give me stomach aches, doesn't make people sick.
[39:23.320 --> 39:26.560]  The other iodine is very toxic and eat holes in your stomach.
[39:26.560 --> 39:28.920]  Consult your physician before you take this.
[39:28.920 --> 39:36.160]  I mix it with water or I take it right under the tongue and it is moe powerful.
[39:36.160 --> 39:40.480]  So I would take a half a dose at first and usually about three weeks in, people detox
[39:40.480 --> 39:44.080]  and it's not too fun.
[39:44.080 --> 39:46.520]  For about four or five days and then it's like you've ever been carrying one of your
[39:46.520 --> 39:49.520]  kids on your shoulders or you're carrying a big backpack and you go up a big hill when
[39:49.520 --> 39:54.680]  you finally get the top of the hill and take the backpack off, it feels like you're flying.
[39:54.680 --> 39:58.320]  About a month after I took X2, I began losing weight.
[39:58.320 --> 40:00.080]  All this oil came out of my skin.
[40:00.080 --> 40:03.760]  Sunspots I had went away and I'd heard that was what would happen.
[40:03.760 --> 40:06.560]  I lost weight without even having to exercise like I was before.
[40:06.560 --> 40:07.560]  It's kind of spoiled me quite frankly.
[40:07.560 --> 40:11.000]  So I'm getting a little bit of weight back just as I never work out anymore.
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.440]  But I'm still lighter than I was six years ago for taking X2.
[40:15.440 --> 40:20.880]  It's just the good halogen, instead the bad halogens fill your glands and you see all
[40:20.880 --> 40:24.360]  the problems and issues out there, so experience iodine for yourself.
[40:24.360 --> 40:28.720]  They give you the bad halogen fluoride in the water and bromine and chlorine, other bad
[40:28.720 --> 40:34.840]  halogens on record that lower IQs, well survival shield does the opposite.
[40:34.840 --> 40:42.600]  So believe me, just type in study show, iodine supplementation even with a cheap bound type
[40:42.600 --> 40:54.160]  increased IQs by 15 points when given to children, that's right, 15 point IQ increase.
[40:54.160 --> 41:04.560]  You know, secret 12 is really pure high quality methicobolamine B12.
[41:04.560 --> 41:07.960]  And it gives me some energy to take it.
[41:07.960 --> 41:09.960]  X2 though, is amazing.
[41:09.960 --> 41:13.360]  In fact sometimes I forget to take it, it's never been a big supplement guy for like
[41:13.360 --> 41:15.160]  a week and then I go, why do I feel so tired?
[41:15.160 --> 41:19.880]  I go, oh, X2 and I take my X2.
[41:19.880 --> 41:25.640]  So again, infowarstore.com, infowarslive.com or 888-253-3139 and I told you this about
[41:25.640 --> 41:26.640]  six months ago.
[41:26.640 --> 41:30.680]  I said we may not be able to get X2 anymore because it comes from the gas drilling, oil
[41:30.680 --> 41:36.560]  drilling companies, 27,000 and 12,000 feet, they run into the crystals and once they figured
[41:36.560 --> 41:41.600]  out there's a market for it other than what they do with pharmaceuticals, a lot of pharmaceuticals
[41:41.600 --> 41:43.280]  are made with iodine as a precursor.
[41:43.280 --> 41:48.040]  That's why raw gas-based iodine is a controlled substance, we got to have a lab with a DEA
[41:48.040 --> 41:49.600]  license and all their stuff.
[41:49.600 --> 41:57.080]  Once it's in the palm oil, it's not a drug, but the point is that this is a big hassle
[41:57.080 --> 41:58.080]  to get.
[41:58.080 --> 41:59.080]  It is a hassle.
[41:59.080 --> 42:02.120]  That's why no one else has it.
[42:02.120 --> 42:06.520]  And so we're really working hard to try to continue to get it, but there's no contract
[42:06.520 --> 42:13.040]  now and six months, a year until we get more, I don't know, but it is a bummer.
[42:13.040 --> 42:18.280]  I'm still discounting it 25% despite that so that everybody can experience it and just
[42:18.280 --> 42:25.320]  know how great iodine is because if you can't get this, hey, seaweed is good, just make sure
[42:25.320 --> 42:26.320]  it's a clean one.
[42:26.320 --> 42:30.520]  It's nothing like this, but it's the next best thing.
[42:30.520 --> 42:34.440]  And there are some Himalayan salts and sea salts that have some of it as well, but a
[42:34.440 --> 42:37.720]  lot of them, again, it's bound into other metals and things that are in the water.
[42:37.720 --> 42:41.200]  And a lot of sea salt has mercury and crap, but if this is totally clean with the palm
[42:41.200 --> 42:46.560]  oil and the purest iodine, I mean, this stuff is amazing.
[42:46.560 --> 42:52.520]  And it is the last run of X2, M4WarsStore.com, M4WarsLive.com, or triple A, 253-3139.
[42:52.520 --> 42:59.520]  Now, the thought police are now banning the term M4Wars, straight ahead, stay with us.

[43:47.080 --> 43:49.920]  paired with our ultimate fish oil, or used separately.

[44:50.320 --> 45:04.440]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[45:04.440 --> 45:09.160]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[45:09.160 --> 45:10.660]  to detoxify the body.
[45:10.660 --> 45:15.520]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[45:15.520 --> 45:20.720]  It's made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[45:20.720 --> 45:23.800]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the infomer.
[45:23.800 --> 45:26.080]  It is a classical 360-win.
[45:26.080 --> 45:30.560]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe
[45:30.560 --> 45:35.240]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[45:35.240 --> 45:36.240]  get.
[45:36.240 --> 45:39.440]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[45:39.440 --> 45:44.480]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[45:44.480 --> 45:49.680]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[45:49.680 --> 45:52.400]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[45:52.400 --> 45:55.680]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[45:55.680 --> 45:59.720]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield InfoWarsLife.com.
[45:59.720 --> 46:04.680]  The scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support
[46:04.680 --> 46:06.400]  and joint support.
[46:06.400 --> 46:09.560]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[46:09.560 --> 46:13.360]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[46:13.360 --> 46:17.720]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[46:17.720 --> 46:21.880]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[46:21.880 --> 46:26.160]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption
[46:26.160 --> 46:31.320]  to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system and
[46:31.320 --> 46:33.120]  so much more.
[46:33.120 --> 46:38.200]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our
[46:38.200 --> 46:43.360]  turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[46:43.360 --> 46:49.320]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme
[46:49.320 --> 46:52.200]  to work synergistically for full body support.
[46:52.200 --> 47:11.880]  Buy bodies today at InfoWarsLife.com or call us at 1-88-253-3139.
[30:35.140 --> 47:41.480]  we're 54 days out from the most important election in world history.
[47:41.480 --> 47:46.720]  All the experts agree, I've been saying it for a couple years.
[47:46.720 --> 47:50.080]  And they're trying to ban us not because we lie, but because we're effective and we
[47:50.080 --> 47:55.400]  love America and we love prosperity and we love freedom and the tyrants don't like that.
[47:55.400 --> 48:00.680]  A little bird told me that Brandon Strach is going to be on Tucker Carlson tonight.
[48:00.680 --> 48:01.680]  That's good.
[48:01.680 --> 48:05.920]  You know, I personally tried to get Strach hooked up with the president and turning point
[48:05.920 --> 48:08.200]  USA because he's very well spoken.
[48:08.200 --> 48:15.240]  His movement is on fire for several months and he's very, very, very patriotic and he's
[48:15.240 --> 48:16.840]  got a big rally coming up.
[48:16.840 --> 48:23.680]  Well, he was on a few days ago and within an hour of him putting on Facebook that he
[48:23.680 --> 48:25.280]  would be on the Alex Jones show.
[48:25.280 --> 48:30.960]  So tune in Patriots, boom, he was banned for 30 days, which again is election meddling.
[48:30.960 --> 48:32.400]  They're doing it everywhere.
[48:32.400 --> 48:36.440]  We have the internal leaked video of Google after Hillary lost saying this will never
[48:36.440 --> 48:37.440]  happen again.
[48:37.440 --> 48:38.440]  We will stop this.
[48:38.440 --> 48:43.320]  I'm going to read the quotes later to talk about how they will control reality.
[48:43.320 --> 48:44.720]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[48:44.720 --> 48:47.480]  Here's Tucker Carlson talking about it last night.
[48:47.480 --> 48:48.480]  Here it is.
[48:48.480 --> 48:53.280]  Well, Jones has been banned from all tech platforms.
[48:53.280 --> 48:54.280]  Nobody said anything.
[48:54.280 --> 48:57.080]  So big text language police are getting bolder.
[48:57.080 --> 49:00.480]  According to the Center for Immigration Studies, Twitter refused to let the organization promote
[49:00.480 --> 49:04.400]  one of its tweets because it included the phrase illegal aliens.
[49:04.400 --> 49:05.400]  That's verboten.
[49:05.400 --> 49:06.400]  Not allowed.
[49:06.400 --> 49:10.680]  Of course, illegal aliens was routinely used by the Obama administration to describe
[49:10.680 --> 49:14.160]  aliens illegally within the United States.
[49:14.160 --> 49:19.720]  Twitter once caught now says the block was a mistake and has been corrected.
[49:19.720 --> 49:22.320]  Yeah, right.
[49:22.320 --> 49:24.800]  And then again, they get into Strachmore later.
[49:24.800 --> 49:27.400]  And then tonight I'm told this is going to be their top story.
[49:27.400 --> 49:35.920]  This is a big deal because Strach is well spoken, nice guy, very G rated, I'd say.
[49:35.920 --> 49:37.680]  He's not bombastic like I am.
[49:37.680 --> 49:42.520]  And boom, you don't share info or some now words.
[49:42.520 --> 49:47.360]  Even though the Silicon Valley meeting that was secret two weeks ago admitted, they were
[49:47.360 --> 49:49.480]  calling it information warfare against us.
[49:49.480 --> 49:52.480]  I chose the term info wars because that's what we're in.
[49:52.480 --> 49:57.280]  When I set up info wars in 1996, who is says 1999.
[49:57.280 --> 50:00.960]  That's when it was transferred to another domain, we're registrar.
[50:00.960 --> 50:05.320]  So joining us is Brandon Strach for this segment, the next, and I did hear from a little bird
[50:05.320 --> 50:06.840]  that they were trying to get you on Tucker tonight.
[50:06.840 --> 50:10.840]  I don't know if you've had that call, but if not, I can give you their number because
[50:10.840 --> 50:14.560]  this is obviously really, really important, Brandon, that we get this out because it's
[50:14.560 --> 50:16.760]  just an avalanche of censorship.
[50:16.760 --> 50:20.720]  And finally, 54 days out, it looks like the president's starting to figure it out.
[50:20.720 --> 50:24.640]  So thanks for joining us and I'm going to be at your march and tell folks the latest
[50:24.640 --> 50:25.640]  developments.
[50:25.640 --> 50:31.080]  Alex, if you can hear me, I cut out there for a bit.
[50:31.080 --> 50:32.080]  I'm sorry.
[50:32.080 --> 50:33.080]  Could I get the question again?
[50:33.080 --> 50:34.080]  It's okay.
[50:34.080 --> 50:35.080]  I know we've had some Skype problems today.
[50:35.080 --> 50:36.080]  No, it's just good to have you here.
[50:36.080 --> 50:37.080]  Tell folks what happened to you.
[50:37.080 --> 50:43.320]  Yeah, so I was promoting my walkway march on Washington and I came on your show a couple
[50:43.320 --> 50:44.320]  of days ago.
[50:44.320 --> 50:45.680]  Thank you for having me on.
[50:45.680 --> 50:50.720]  And I like to keep the people in the walkway campaign a prize of everything that's going
[50:50.720 --> 50:51.720]  on.
[50:51.720 --> 50:55.720]  So anytime I do any media of any kind, I make a note to say, hey, Patriots, I'm going on
[50:55.720 --> 50:58.360]  such and such a show and be sure to tune in.
[50:58.360 --> 51:04.400]  I literally wrote the post, hey, Patriots, I'll be live on Info Wars in 15 minutes.
[51:04.400 --> 51:11.800]  Be sure to tune in and I got a 30 day ban from Facebook for writing that.
[51:11.800 --> 51:14.680]  And that's what Paul Watson was told by high level folks at Twitter.
[51:14.680 --> 51:21.080]  I haven't really talked about this yet, but he's got some fans over at Twitter and they
[51:21.080 --> 51:24.640]  were in the meeting with Dorsey and we actually know why it was banned.
[51:24.640 --> 51:28.560]  It wasn't bullying the CNN reporter who bullies me.
[51:28.560 --> 51:33.440]  It was confronting Rubio.
[51:33.440 --> 51:37.480]  And so they thought since I was mean to Republicans that it was okay to ban me because now the
[51:37.480 --> 51:40.880]  Republicans won't come after them and it shows they're really concerned about Republicans
[51:40.880 --> 51:41.880]  waking up.
[51:41.880 --> 51:47.320]  But Republicans, it doesn't seem understand what's going on.
[51:47.320 --> 51:48.320]  Possibly not.
[51:48.320 --> 51:52.560]  But I mean, this is a, it's happening all the time and I think what it's so interesting
[51:52.560 --> 51:56.800]  like you said, my post wasn't even an opinion.
[51:56.800 --> 52:00.600]  I mean, there was nothing even slightly controversial, provocative.
[52:00.600 --> 52:05.320]  I was literally just plugging an interview, you know, so I mean, at this point, it's literally
[52:05.320 --> 52:08.920]  just naming a name or saying a word.
[52:08.920 --> 52:13.480]  And I mean, also, let's be honest, I'm also, you know, putting on the, the walk away march
[52:13.480 --> 52:14.480]  on Washington.
[52:14.480 --> 52:18.240]  I doubt that every person who's saying the word info wars or Alex Jones is getting banned,
[52:18.240 --> 52:22.560]  but I think that they found this as a convenient excuse to get rid of me for 30 days and try
[52:22.560 --> 52:26.760]  to sabotage my ability to play in the March.
[52:26.760 --> 52:29.960]  Now there's a military tactic that they started doing in World War one.
[52:29.960 --> 52:35.360]  The Germans did and then, and then the allies adopted it where they would bullhorn.
[52:35.360 --> 52:36.360]  We're not attacking.
[52:36.360 --> 52:38.200]  This is not an assault.
[52:38.200 --> 52:39.200]  Pieces been declared.
[52:39.200 --> 52:43.720]  Put your hands up and they found enough people would get addled by it and at least listen
[52:43.720 --> 52:46.240]  to it, but they wouldn't aim their howitzers.
[52:46.240 --> 52:50.800]  They wouldn't aim their, their rifles, their machine guns, their water cooled machine guns.
[52:50.800 --> 52:54.000]  And it would just cause disarray and a few people would panic go, they're friends.
[52:54.000 --> 52:57.000]  They want to be, and they, you know, get killed.
[52:57.000 --> 53:00.000]  And it's the same thing here where they go, no one's censoring you.
[53:00.000 --> 53:01.000]  Nothing's happening.
[53:01.000 --> 53:02.400]  They've been doing that for two years.
[53:02.400 --> 53:03.920]  Now it's total.
[53:03.920 --> 53:06.880]  And so they're like, okay, we are banning all you, what are you going to do about it?
[53:06.880 --> 53:09.080]  And then the Google says, we're not going to work with the Pentagon anymore.
[53:09.080 --> 53:11.600]  We're moving to China to help their military with AI.
[53:11.600 --> 53:12.600]  That was two months ago.
[53:12.600 --> 53:16.800]  It is, it is belligerent criminal activity by these groups.
[53:16.800 --> 53:17.960]  This is not just censorship.
[53:17.960 --> 53:20.240]  It is an information takeover.
[53:20.240 --> 53:21.740]  It is an information monopoly.
[53:21.740 --> 53:23.240]  It is election meddling.
[53:23.240 --> 53:27.200]  And while they've got us looking at the Russians that literally can hardly tie their shoes
[53:27.200 --> 53:31.560]  when it comes to election meddling, Facebook, Google and all of them are gaming everything.
[53:31.560 --> 53:33.880]  What do you think Trump should do about this?
[53:33.880 --> 53:37.360]  Well, I think that at this point, you know, he, we need to step in.
[53:37.360 --> 53:38.360]  I think it's not just Trump.
[53:38.360 --> 53:42.240]  I think that any of us who are on the conservative side need to sort of band together.
[53:42.240 --> 53:46.320]  This needs to be an issue that we all stand strong together on going forward.
[53:46.320 --> 53:47.320]  And we take this issue up.
[53:47.320 --> 53:49.440]  I don't know if this means an internet bill of rights.
[53:49.440 --> 53:52.400]  I don't know exactly what this means, but I think that this is something that the conservative
[53:52.400 --> 53:56.400]  movement as a whole, we need to band together and make this an issue that we press for going
[53:56.400 --> 53:57.400]  forward together.
[53:57.400 --> 53:58.400]  Well, that's right.
[53:58.400 --> 54:02.920]  Because, you know, we hear about foreign countries meddling, Russia doesn't have one
[54:02.920 --> 54:08.280]  one hundredth the power of all the big tech heads that met and are in the emails saying
[54:08.280 --> 54:11.760]  we're going to deliver the election to Hillary like we did to Obama.
[54:11.760 --> 54:14.520]  We're going to suppress it and censor conservatives.
[54:14.520 --> 54:16.520]  We're going to shadow ban them.
[54:16.520 --> 54:21.520]  They're never going to know why we have them on video saying it about me at Google and
[54:21.520 --> 54:24.400]  at the New York Times that works with them to censor me.
[54:24.400 --> 54:25.920]  So they're now doing it to you.
[54:25.920 --> 54:29.440]  It's a concerted, racketeering, organized crime.
[54:29.440 --> 54:30.760]  And those aren't words.
[54:30.760 --> 54:32.240]  That's what they're doing.
[54:32.240 --> 54:37.800]  Well, it's just remarkable to me that they like who are these people to decide for everybody
[54:37.800 --> 54:42.000]  else what other people can and cannot hear what they can and cannot see and what they're
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.440]  allowed to know or not know.
[54:44.440 --> 54:50.840]  I mean, it's so fascinating to me that the name Alex Jones or Info Wars is so dangerous
[54:50.840 --> 54:55.600]  and threatening that anybody needs to be banned if they even say that name yet people on the
[54:55.600 --> 55:01.160]  left ten thousand times a day use the word Hitler when speaking about our president.
[55:01.160 --> 55:02.800]  That's not a problem for them.
[55:02.800 --> 55:06.400]  So I mean, the word Info Wars or Alex Jones is obviously more dangerous in their mind
[55:06.400 --> 55:08.080]  than Hitler.
[55:08.080 --> 55:11.480]  I was trying to wrap my mind around it yesterday when I found this happened to you because
[55:11.480 --> 55:12.480]  this is thought police.
[55:12.480 --> 55:13.840]  It's word police.
[55:13.840 --> 55:18.000]  And so if Alex Jones becomes the new N word or Info Wars becomes the new N word, it could
[55:18.000 --> 55:25.320]  be any other word they want, and I was thinking about how Kafka, Esker or Wellian that is.
[55:25.320 --> 55:28.560]  And really, they've succeeded at doing this in China.
[55:28.560 --> 55:29.880]  So people keep saying, this is crazy.
[55:29.880 --> 55:35.240]  The Streisand effect, they really believe they're going to get away with this.
[55:35.240 --> 55:41.400]  And that's why I'm so concerned because this is so over the top.
[55:41.400 --> 55:42.400]  It's so surreal.
[55:42.400 --> 55:49.360]  I'm actually speechless that now they're saying you can't say Alex Jones or say Info Wars.
[55:49.360 --> 55:51.600]  That is just next level.
[55:51.600 --> 55:52.600]  Right.
[55:52.600 --> 55:56.160]  But you know, in this weird way, it's almost good that it happened to me.
[55:56.160 --> 55:59.760]  I think it's good that it happened in this way because like you said earlier in the show,
[55:59.760 --> 56:01.840]  you know, I'm not really a controversial guy.
[56:01.840 --> 56:03.320]  I'm not really a provocateur.
[56:03.320 --> 56:05.320]  That's certainly not my public image.
[56:05.320 --> 56:10.800]  You know, I'm just literally kind of a person who's trying to run this walkaway campaign.
[56:10.800 --> 56:13.160]  I don't go on there saying outrageous opinions.
[56:13.160 --> 56:14.920]  I don't go out there saying shocking things.
[56:14.920 --> 56:20.480]  So for this to happen to me and literally just over a word, I wasn't even stating an
[56:20.480 --> 56:21.480]  opinion.
[56:21.480 --> 56:25.480]  I was literally just advising people that I was doing an interview on Info Wars.
[56:25.480 --> 56:30.360]  So this just goes to show the level at which they're willing to reach to do this.
[56:30.360 --> 56:31.360]  It's outrageous.
[56:31.360 --> 56:34.760]  I mean, there's literally no good explanation for it other than the fact that they're trying
[56:34.760 --> 56:41.200]  to sabotage me and my mission and they are literally trying to erase your existence completely.
[56:41.200 --> 56:46.240]  I was talking to some folks high level in the Pentagon a few weeks ago and I said, Alex,
[56:46.240 --> 56:51.480]  we don't have the total numbers, but they basically sorrows when he collapsed more than
[56:51.480 --> 56:54.320]  20 countries isn't just worth 50 billion.
[56:54.320 --> 56:57.360]  He reportedly is worth hundreds of billions.
[56:57.360 --> 56:59.880]  He's probably one of the rich people in the world.
[56:59.880 --> 57:06.120]  And they said, son, he's got over 170 million on the street against you.
[57:06.120 --> 57:07.120]  We've tracked.
[57:07.120 --> 57:09.680]  So a lot of this is he, I just got under a skin.
[57:09.680 --> 57:11.920]  His son is now taking over and really hates me.
[57:11.920 --> 57:12.920]  And I did.
[57:12.920 --> 57:13.920]  I have called him names.
[57:13.920 --> 57:14.920]  It's true.
[57:14.920 --> 57:18.520]  And, and, and they're just a lot of this is just their total vengeance.
[57:18.520 --> 57:19.840]  And I think it's going to blow up in their face.
[57:19.840 --> 57:20.840]  What do you think?
[57:20.840 --> 57:23.960]  Well, I think it's going to blow up in their face too, because what's actually happening.
[57:23.960 --> 57:24.960]  I panicked yesterday.
[57:24.960 --> 57:25.960]  I really did panic.
[57:25.960 --> 57:26.960]  We're trying to plan this march on Washington.
[57:26.960 --> 57:29.120]  It's going to cost us half a million dollars.
[57:29.120 --> 57:32.600]  So what's actually happened is it's sort of energized and bolstered everybody to want
[57:32.600 --> 57:36.160]  to help out, get the word up about the walkway march on Washington.
[57:36.160 --> 57:37.800]  I think it's going to blow up in their face completely.
[57:37.800 --> 57:38.800]  I agree.
[57:38.800 --> 57:39.800]  All right.
[57:39.800 --> 57:41.480]  Back in, in 70 seconds, I want you to finish up about the march.
[57:41.480 --> 57:42.480]  How folks get involved.

[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:10.920]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:22.680]  This is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:39.120]  Okay, Brandon Strock is leading the hashtag walk away movement.
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:43.320]  We're going to put his website on screen, walkawaymarch.com.
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:47.800]  Now that URL isn't banned yet, so get it out there, walkawaymarch.com.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:52.360]  Again, that's why Drudge came here two years ago and said, we've got to have our own websites.
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:56.200]  He goes, Alex, pull out of Twitter and Facebook now as your main base.
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.200]  They're going to ban you.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:03.480]  Because he was told by the other conservative Supreme Court justice, not the one that died.
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:06.640]  So we only got four more minutes left with you.
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.840]  Please start coming back on a regular basis.
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:08.840]  I know you're busy.
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:09.840]  I'm sorry.
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:10.840]  I had Skype problems earlier.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:14.400]  Tell folks about the march coming up again, what happened to you, this next level of draconian
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.400]  behavior.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:20.360]  Well, so yes, we have a walkaway march on Washington that we're planning October 26th
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:21.360]  through the 28th.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.760]  That's a Friday through a Sunday.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:28.000]  It's going to start off with a gala dinner at the Trump International Hotel.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.640]  It's going to be a really, really incredible event.
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:33.600]  We're expecting some big name speakers and just a really, really great, amazing event
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:34.600]  to kick the weekend off.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.600]  They got amazing stakes there.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:37.600]  Yes.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.400]  And then on Saturday is the main event.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:41.880]  It's the march culminating in the rally.
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:45.880]  We're going to be marching from the DNC and Washington DC to our nation's capitals.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:49.400]  We are walking away from the Democratic Party to the nation's capitol.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.120]  Once again, we're going to have incredible speakers there in a big rally.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.320]  They're in the front lawn in front of the capitol building.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.320]  It's going to be stunning and amazing.
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.600]  We'll have some entertainment afterwards.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:01.200]  And then the next day is Sunday, the 28th, and we're going to have a closing brunch and
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.160]  get people the day to travel home.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:06.000]  So this is obviously a pretty massive undertaking.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.760]  And it's something we wanted to do strategically before the midterms to really make a powerful
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:10.760]  statement.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.080]  One of the things that we want all Americans to walk away from the Democratic Party and
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.680]  liberalism, but we really, really want these minority groups are taking advantage of to
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:21.880]  really wake up and pay attention to what the mainstream media and what the Democratic Party
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:22.880]  is doing.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:26.760]  So I envision this a massive event where we have tens of thousands of African Americans,
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:31.640]  tens of thousands of Hispanics and LGBT people, as well as every other type of person, walking
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:35.640]  away from the Democratic Party so that everybody, including these minority groups, can see this
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.480]  is where something's going on.
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:41.280]  You need to be walking away and paying attention and that you're not alone.
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:46.040]  There are groups of people who are walking away with you and you can do this with them.
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:49.560]  But so I try to get this word out and I try to, you know, it's a lot of work doing this.
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.360]  We're trying to raise all the money ourselves.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.720]  We're putting this all together ourselves.
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:55.480]  It's essential that I be able to communicate with my people.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:03:00.640]  So imagine yesterday when I woke up and Facebook banned me for 30 days because I use the word
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.600]  info wars in a post.
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:06.680]  So I've lost my ability to communicate with my people for the next 30 days.
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:10.040]  My team and I are working on a workaround so that I can get my communication back and
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.160]  forth with them.
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.200]  We're trying to raise half a million dollars in the next.
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.600]  And by the way, people don't know why I don't do events.
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:20.880]  If you even try to get something, say at the Sheraton in LA, not even the nicest hotel,
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:25.480]  you know, just decent, you want a 2000 person ballroom and then the security and everything,
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:30.320]  you know, it's like $200,000 and you got to charge people 100 bucks and they think you're
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:33.720]  ripping them off and then you lose money because you got to have security and you got to have
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:35.120]  this and you got to have that.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:38.480]  And then all of a sudden the hotel goes, we're going to cancel because of threats we've had
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.680]  unless you spend more money on security.
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:45.400]  So I know for a fact, I haven't done DC marches because exactly they've told me it's a half
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.080]  million dollars to do what you're doing.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.080]  Right.
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:51.760]  Well, yeah, I mean, just like you said, there's permitting, there's security, you know, there's
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:55.400]  yes, there's so, so much that goes into it, not to mention advertising, branding, getting
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.840]  all this stuff out there.
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:59.000]  But I'm actually not too concerned about it.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.560]  And I mean, if I have the ability to communicate with my people, we're doing a great job fundraising
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:03.560]  at this point.
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:07.160]  If anybody would like to contribute, they can go to walkwaymarch.com and please click
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.160]  fundraising.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.160]  It'll take you to our GoFundMe.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:13.920]  Of course, we're always looking for any kind of sponsors or donations from people who
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:18.320]  are at a larger level, they're able to, but I'm telling you, I was devastated yesterday,
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.320]  Alex.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:23.040]  I mean, I was ready to shut the march down entirely because I thought, how the hell are
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:26.200]  we going to pull this off if I can't communicate with my people?
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.400]  Like I said, my team and I have kind of worked on a workaround.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.120]  They think it's going to be okay.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.280]  But this is what they're trying to do.
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:34.960]  They're trying to get people like me who are trying to have a voice and make a difference
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:38.560]  to cower and say, you know what, I'm not as, they're bigger than me.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.560]  They're stronger than me.
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:40.560]  I might as well quit.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.320]  I might as well give up because how can I fight against them?
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.280]  Well, I'm not going to quit and I'm not going to give up.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.280]  I'm going to keep marching on.
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.280]  I'm going to fight back.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.280]  Wow.
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.280]  You are definitely on fire.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.280]  This is so exciting.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.280]  Walkawaymarch.com.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:55.240]  Brandon Strach will talk to you again soon and absolutely strives that effect that's
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:56.240]  happening.
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.240]  God bless you.
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:02.520]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:06.520]  Info Wars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with

[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:57.360]  Pro Pure Whole House Filtration System today.
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.360]  We're bringing the conditioning.
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.360]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:06:59.360]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:00.360]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:03.360]  But there's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:08.120]  Google has been accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:13.160]  changing its algorithm to marry stories like the Clinton body count story that's according
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.160]  to website InfoWars.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:19.160]  This coverage has confirmed there are recent shooters to the fully automatic weapons.
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:24.160]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.160]  JFK was shot from the back and the front.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:30.160]  It was almost as if it were a planned invasion.
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.160]  It just panicked.
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:34.160]  It took the babies out of incubators.
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:39.160]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:43.160]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:46.160]  Operating areas that we can't control.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.160]  UFOs.
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.160]  Is this global governance at last?
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:52.160]  Is it one world with central bankers in charge?
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:54.160]  Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:57.160]  But some former U.S. naval officers say it was on purpose.
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:01.160]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:06.160]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.160]  Russian, stop.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.160]  Denied everything.
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.160]  He called it all fake news.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:13.160]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.160]  This is the national emergency.
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.160]  If they killed Trump or removed Trump,
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:21.160]  it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:23.160]  This is a keen high-level emergency.
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.160]  We are at war with Russia.
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:29.160]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:32.160]  that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks?
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:35.160]  The White House and the President are citing info wars.
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:37.160]  They can shut us down, you're next.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:42.160]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.160]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.160]  You're watching this live Thursday, September 13th, Global Transmission.
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:12.160]  And if you're watching us on television, you can see thousands of illegal aliens
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:16.160]  in military uniforms carrying giant rucksacks on their backs,
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:21.160]  many carrying fully automatic assault rifles on horseback.
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:27.160]  So this is not your oceanfront property in Arizona.
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:30.160]  And from your front porch, you can see the sea.
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:33.160]  Let's hear a little bit from George Strayer right now while we watch this video.
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:38.160]  Now, if you'll buy that.
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:41.160]  I got some motion from property.
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:51.160]  You know, I got a signal from high-level folks in Army Special Operations
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:54.160]  that they know what's going on.
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:57.160]  And not from Steve Pachennick, it was from people at Fort Bragg.
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:02.160]  And they said, Alex, we believe March is when they're going to try to kill the president.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:07.160]  And they said, we're ready and just you need to be ready.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.160]  And I said, should I relay that info?
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:12.160]  And they said, well, the enemy may change their operations,
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:16.160]  but it's definitely being directed from China and they plan to kill Trump in March.
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:20.160]  I thought I would just let people know that Fort Bragg's preparing for that.
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:23.160]  They think something's in March of next year.
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:26.160]  But who knows, the enemy could change their plan.
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:28.160]  Let me explain something.
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:34.160]  Thousands of armed men on horseback with giant drug packages coming across one ranch
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:38.160]  all confirmed, infohors.com, Daily Caller.
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:43.160]  And I was on infohors last night, saw you go to that so-called church,
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:49.160]  which are really illegal alien invasion points, openly funded by the UN and George Soros.
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.160]  And then I went to sleep and forgot about it.
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:54.160]  And I got back up and I saw comments on infohors going,
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:11:01.160]  Jones, why does this headline say you're covering the CBS head, you know, reportedly roping women?
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:04.160]  That isn't important. It's the invasion.
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.160]  And I'm like, yeah, partner.
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.160]  I screenshotted that and sent it to all the producers.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:12.160]  And I said, the listeners are right. We need to be on this.
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.160]  But this has already been going on.
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:18.160]  But then listeners think there's like some cultic control here where I'm telling everyone what to cover.
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:20.160]  Believe me, we get so close to the problem.
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:28.160]  We need you to send us emails and call us and say, hey, why aren't you doing this?
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:31.160]  Because Owen got so upset by this last night, he went down to one of these churches.
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.160]  It's a staging ground.
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:36.160]  And they're down in Guatemala and Nicaragua and El Salvador.
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.160]  This is from the UN.
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:44.160]  The UN aid agency, middle of last year, about 14 months ago,
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:51.160]  Trump killed the UNESCO treaty that George Herbert Walker Bush signed one month before he left office in 1992.
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:53.160]  Signed in December, 1992.
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:57.160]  And if you read it, it says our education, our system, everything is UNESCO.
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:02.160]  And so what the UN cultural, economic, environmental organization says,
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:07.160]  you then adopt as the curriculum, as the border, they would decide who could come in.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:12.160]  They would certify the Afghans and the Somalis and then say they're allowed to come in.
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:15.160]  And our State Department would then certify it.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.160]  Now that's the UN running our borders.
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.160]  That's world government.
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.160]  Trump pulled it out.
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.160]  So what do they do?
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:35.160]  They went and they got involved and Soros and the UN set up refugee centers in Nicaragua, El Salvador,
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:44.160]  Sun Salvador, and Guatemala, and then they're publicly funding with billions of dollars, much of it US taxpayers through the UN to flood us.
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.160]  This is a weapon system.
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:48.160]  They don't care about poor third world people.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:54.160]  They want to bring them in desperate, make sure they never get jobs just like in Europe, keep them under their control,
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:13:00.160]  and then have a kept group that'll burn down cities if they're not given what they need.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:08.160]  And that's it. That's why 80 plus percent of the Islamic Middle Eastern North African invaders who were brought in the last five years to Europe,
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:12.160]  now it's 12 million of them, 80 plus percent never get a job.
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:14.160]  And you know who they deport?
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:20.160]  Anyone that converts to Christianity, this is in the news, anyone that gets a job.
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:25.160]  So you're out of North Africa, the Middle East, you go, I want to be a Christian and I want a job and I like this.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:38.160]  Your ass is shipped out, but you're like, you want to walk around your nightgown all day and wipe your ass with your hand and do all the rest of it.
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:42.160]  You are staying, you are golden, baby.
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:48.160]  So I try to come up with words to describe them banning the term info wars, which is happening on YouTube and Facebook,
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:51.160]  and they're banning people saying you can't use a word.
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:57.160]  You can't even know if it's negative and you say, see, this is the, this is the counterfeit currency.
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:04.160]  They tell people the New York Times and the Daily Mail, we won't just pay you $20,000 to $50,000 to lie about all the shows.
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:08.160]  And most people's credit hardly by taking the money.
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:18.160]  We will, we will put articles about you and talk about your business and put your picture up and it's a, it's a form of payment.
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:28.160]  So the media uses clicks and hits, which is literal money if you're advertising, but for many just the glory to then, if you lie, they give you promotion.
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:33.160]  So if you lie about info wars, we're going to come back to, oh, in the next segment, just sitting there very stoically.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:37.160]  If you lie about info wars or, or trumpet anybody else, they push your video.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:41.160]  The big thing about QAnon to know is they never get demonetized.
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:46.160]  Nothing pro Q. Oh, it gets instantly pushed the front because it's literal delusional garbage.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.160]  I mean, I've talked to folks.
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:50.160]  Trump hates sessions.
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:51.160]  He hates Mueller.
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.160]  You know, it's a real death battle.
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.160]  It's not, oh, Mueller is good and Alex is bad.
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.160]  He'll sue me again.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.160]  Well, Alex is, Alex was actually the bad guy.
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.160]  Two said, we all go down the rabbit hole.
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:01.160]  We all go together.
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.160]  There's cult talk.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.160]  I'll get to that later.
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:09.160]  But this whole situation with the open border and the invasion, this is so stark, it made you mad, didn't it?
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:13.160]  Well, and here's what I'm doing now, Alex, because they're trying to censor us online.
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:18.160]  They want to come and disrupt any time that we want to have an event or a march or Trump wasn't having an event.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.160]  So why can't we go to their events and try to have a conversation?
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:23.160]  Now, obviously you saw what happened.
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:28.160]  But I confronted, I believe I'm the first one to confront a congressman over that video.
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.160]  I don't think anyone else has done it.
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.160]  Sylvia Garcia was in attendance.
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:31.160]  Tell folks what happens.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.160]  We're gonna come and give you the floor.
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:36.160]  I mean, you're not going to confront these people that are saying to have an open border.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:42.160]  And the main sentence, the main thing is here, Trump is separating children at the border.
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:43.160]  This is, we're in Texas.
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:49.160]  We have to do something about immigration policy and it's all Trump's fault this and separating the children and the families.
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:54.160]  And I'm just like, hey, by the way, a bunch of men just came across the border with guns.
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.160]  You care about that?
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:57.160]  Oh, info wars is getting shut down.
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:58.160]  Hear that?
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:03.160]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:06.160]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:10.160]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:17.160]  Go to fakeTV.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:22.160]  Security is a mindset and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.160]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:51.160]  FakeTV.com
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:57.160]  B-E-R-K-E-Y
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:27.160]  B-E-R-K-E-Y
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:57.160]  B-E-R-K-E-Y
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:27.160]  B-E-R-K-E-Y
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:57.160]  B-E-R-K-E-Y
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.160]  B-E-R-K-E-Y
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:58.160]  Now, this is the verboten info. This is what they don't want you to see.
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:24.160]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:31.160]  From the front lines of The Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:37.160]  And the colors of the sea, find your eyes with trembling mermaids.
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:41.160]  And you touch the distant beaches with tales of regularities.
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:46.160]  How his naked ears were tortured by the siren sweetly singing.
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:51.160]  For the sparkling waves are calling you to kiss the white laced land.
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:56.160]  This is not a drill. This is not a movie. This is not Road Warrior.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:01.160]  This is 2018, North America.
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:05.160]  Heavily armed individuals, over a thousand of them caught on camera in camouflage,
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:10.160]  entering country illegally through Arizona Ranch from Mexico.
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:15.160]  We've been playing the bombshell video. We'll roll some of it right now.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:19.160]  This is incredible. And this is just one ranch.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:23.160]  Dozens of hours, over a thousand people clearly drug mulling in.
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:25.160]  Big packages on their back.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:29.160]  Semi-automatic weapons, horseback as well.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:33.160]  And Owen sees this, so he goes down to one of these, quote, liberal churches
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:35.160]  that really just means a U.N. command base.
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:40.160]  And again, the U.N. from Central America is running this whole operation
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:42.160]  through UNESCO that Trump pulled us out of.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:44.160]  And just like they're hammering Europe with open borders
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:48.160]  and the Zodiac boats are paid for in the EU Army that they said didn't exist,
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:51.160]  now is going to increase its troops sevenfold to, quote,
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:53.160]  keep countries from leaving. Wow.
[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:55.160]  Unelected won't let you leave.
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.160]  Armed troops.
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:58.160]  Talk about Hitler invading Europe.
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:02.160]  The head of the Nazi operation, industrially, was the Junkers.
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:05.160]  The Junker is the head of the unelected EU situation.
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:07.160]  So it's all repeating itself.
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.160]  George Soros is at the heart of it.
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.160]  Owen, set this up, what's happened here.
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:14.160]  And then you go out to this church where this congressman is,
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.160]  and you bring this up.
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:19.160]  I mean, recap what you said earlier, get into all of it.
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:23.160]  Well, I saw this video and I was shocked, A, at the video,
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:25.160]  but then B, at the lack of media response.
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:28.160]  So as usual, Info Wars has to bring light to this stuff
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.160]  and force the mainstream media to cover it.
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:35.160]  And I'm also on a bunch of liberal or leftist e-mail chains here in Austin
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:37.160]  just so I can keep up with what they're doing.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.160]  And every once in a while, there's an event that I like to go to
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:41.160]  and talk to these people.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.160]  Most of the time, I don't even bother, Alex,
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.160]  because what I learned after going about five of these things,
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:47.160]  most of the time, you're kind of just dealing with
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.160]  deranged individuals and cult leaders.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:52.160]  And it's just kind of sick to even film it, I'll be honest.
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:55.160]  But I go to this event and Sylvia Garcia is there,
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:58.160]  who is a congresswoman, and I'm just sitting there filming
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:00.160]  and they open it up to questions.
[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:02.160]  And of course, they're bashing Trump the whole time,
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:04.160]  saying Trump is separating children from families,
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.160]  saying we need to do something about the children,
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:08.160]  we need to do something about this awful situation at the border, yada, yada, yada.
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.160]  By the way, one of the women up there, Alex,
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:14.160]  you know, you say they use these churches as grounds
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.160]  to bring in illegal migrants.
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:18.160]  You know, he's not just saying that, folks.
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:20.160]  There was a woman on the panel, she was a panelist,
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:23.160]  who bragged about how she was an undocumented immigrant,
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.160]  how she was in the country illegally.
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:27.160]  Now, I didn't call ICE on her, I didn't call police.
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:31.160]  Oh, no, the UN coordinates at the jumping off points
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:36.160]  in Tripoli, Libya, in the capital city of Guatemala,
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:38.160]  Guatemala City.
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:41.160]  It's on the news that UN has these huge operations
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:43.160]  and they say, don't get off the train, here's your money.
[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:45.160]  The Mexican government will arrest you,
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:47.160]  but they're going to let you go El Norte.
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:49.160]  And then they get here and they're told where to go,
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:51.160]  the Democrats are waiting with buses.
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:53.160]  And then they load them on, they put them on welfare,
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:55.160]  they skim a bunch of the money.
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.160]  I mean, this is a criminal operation.
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.160]  So there's the event right there, guys.
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:23:59.160]  Pull that page back up.
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:00.160]  It was a panel last night,
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.160]  Texas is ground zero for immigration policy.
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:04.160]  Well, okay, what are they really talking about?
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:07.160]  Well, we're ground zero for the UN destroying our borders.
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:10.160]  And it was really just an anti-Trump, anti-borders,
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:13.160]  whatever liberal talking point, panel fest.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.160]  And so Trump's being mean to children,
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:16.160]  even though he's not.
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:18.160]  It's a war zone, collapsed country.
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:21.160]  All these 100 people show up, you got to check who they are.
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:22.160]  They process them.
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.160]  And they say, don't process them, like Obama did,
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:27.160]  load them directly on buses so they can be sex trafficked,
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:29.160]  even as the Washington Post admitted,
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.160]  sex trafficking children.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:34.160]  They want children alone, seven, eight years old,
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:37.160]  to be given to Democrats on buses.
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.160]  And it was the ACLU.
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.160]  I've seen the video, it's like little potbelly guys,
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:43.160]  come on, go, children come to me and the children are gone.
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:44.160]  And as you pointed out,
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:47.160]  it was the ACLU that started this actually decades ago,
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:48.160]  but they don't care about that.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:49.160]  The ACLU was the one saying,
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.160]  you can't just put kids in general population.
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:53.160]  So we'll play the clip in the next segment, Alex,
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.160]  so that people can hear.
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:55.160]  And then they brag,
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:57.160]  they're happy that free speech is dead.
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.160]  They brag about you being deplatformed.
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:59.160]  You're going to love that.
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.160]  They're like, oh, you're not on the air anymore,
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:02.160]  which is even true.
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:05.160]  Yeah, so it's just, it's all crazy.
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.160]  But I point out, Alex, I'm like, well, okay,
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:09.160]  if you want to do something about,
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:10.160]  because what is their complaint?
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:12.160]  Oh, the children are being mistreated and they're coming here
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:14.160]  and they're being separated and the families and it's all bad.
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:16.160]  And I said, well, look, why don't we have a border?
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:18.160]  Why don't we control the border?
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:20.160]  And part of the problem is, look at this.
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:22.160]  And I, and I brought a stack of news
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.160]  so I could give one to everyone there.
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.160]  And I said, I have a stack of news.
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:27.160]  I'll give one to everyone here.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:30.160]  Raw video armed men in military uniforms
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:32.160]  coming across the border illegally.
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.160]  This is not good for anyone.
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:37.160]  And of course, then they, oh, we got info wars in the house.
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.160]  Oh, get out, bye.
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:39.160]  You know, they try to kick me out.
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:40.160]  They don't want to answer my question.
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:42.160]  And I say, well, now hold on a second.
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:44.160]  This is a congresswoman.
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:46.160]  I have a serious concern.
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.160]  This is a public event.
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.160]  And I, you live here.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:49.160]  You pay taxes.
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:50.160]  I came.
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:51.160]  I'm talking.
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:53.160]  And so they try to shut me off.
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:55.160]  And the congresswoman before she,
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.160]  before she makes a drastic mistake,
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:00.160]  realizes, uh-oh, I better at least hear this gentleman out
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:02.160]  and says, okay, well, let me see the news.
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:04.160]  Yeah, yeah, well, I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.160]  You don't know what I'm talking about.
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.160]  You don't know about the wide open border.
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:08.160]  Give me a break.
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:10.160]  Or 200,000 dead the last few years.
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:12.160]  Dead bodies everywhere.
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:17.160]  Literal road warrior, 18 wheelers with giant scoops,
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.160]  burning buildings, mass, I mean, it is,
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.160]  it is beyond any science fiction movie.
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:23.160]  Where's the movie about Mexico?
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.160]  Devil calls it worship Satan.
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:26.160]  MS13, you name it.
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:30.160]  Torturing families to death to get vampiric power.
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:31.160]  That's mainstream news.
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:33.160]  Where's the movies about that?
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:36.160]  Well, how about all of these trucks and box trucks
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:39.160]  and semi-trucks that have been found in parking lots,
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.160]  Walmart parking lots?
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:41.160]  With hundreds of dead.
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.160]  Just people in the trucks.
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:45.160]  They were obviously coyoteed across the border.
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:47.160]  And then they just, well, they tell the families,
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:50.160]  you haven't paid extra, so they locked the doors
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:52.160]  and kill them.
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:54.160]  And that's the thing.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:57.160]  It'll be like, oh, we found 27 dead people.
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:58.160]  We found 100 dead people.
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:01.160]  And some children, imagine a mass shooting of five kids
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:02.160]  is all of the news.
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:04.160]  But when they find thousands of total dead people,
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:07.160]  mainly in Texas, they don't even cover it.
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:09.160]  Because again, they don't want us to discuss it.
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:11.160]  Just like Facebook is banning the term.
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:13.160]  And so it's Twitter illegal alien.
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:15.160]  Here's the important thing though, Alex,
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:17.160]  because this is just one man.
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:19.160]  And like you said, nobody gave me this directive.
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:20.160]  You didn't tell me to do this.
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:22.160]  Rob, dude, didn't tell me to do this.
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:23.160]  I just, I found this.
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.160]  That's why you're so good, Alan.
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.160]  You're just like a heat-sinking mess.
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:26.160]  And I'm not bragging.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:28.160]  It's just my point here is that Alex,
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:30.160]  this is what we have to do to win.
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:31.160]  Yes.
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:32.160]  We have to go out where they're at
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:34.160]  and not yell and scream and call them nods.
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:37.160]  No, politely say, hey, man, here's the video.
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:40.160]  A thousand plus men on horseback with machine guns,
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:42.160]  with giant bags on their back to be weapons.
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:43.160]  Who the hell knows?
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:45.160]  In camo invading.
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:49.160]  And you're saying Trump's bad because they check who's who
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:50.160]  at the border.
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:52.160]  76% aren't even accompanied by adults.
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:54.160]  We want to throw them in general population.
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:56.160]  No, their answer is let them go.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:58.160]  They have to change the subject because what they're doing
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:27:59.160]  is indefensible.
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:00.160]  It is insane.
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:03.160]  And people just need to realize if they want to sit there
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.160]  and they want to brag about infowars being to platform,
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:06.160]  well, that's fine.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:07.160]  I just dominated your event.
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:09.160]  I just won their event.
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:12.160]  I just showed up and won their event because that's what
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:14.160]  one informed patriot.
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:16.160]  And then they'll say, oh, we'll get rid of your sub Facebook
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:17.160]  account.
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:18.160]  Good.
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:19.160]  We'll break up Facebook.
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:20.160]  We'll break up Twitter.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:21.160]  And I can tell you, it's coming.
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:23.160]  So, so you guys are going to lose the election.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.160]  Red waves here.
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:25.160]  You committed criminal actions.
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.160]  You've tried to racketeer.
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:28.160]  You are screwed.
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:31.160]  Well, this is what I want for the Infowars Army, Alex.
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:33.160]  There's there's leftist events.
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:34.160]  There's leftists.
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:35.160]  Let's talk about it when we come back.
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:36.160]  But that's the thing.
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:39.160]  Leak video Google leadership dismayed reaction to election
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:42.160]  of Trump pledge to defeat Trump in the future by controlling
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:43.160]  the public's minds.
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:44.160]  These are close.
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:46.160]  We have Jim Jordan saying that we're going to.
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:47.160]  These are criminals.
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:52.160]  Google runs China's extermination operations and spying.
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:57.160]  These are murdering criminals.
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:00.160]  Let's talk tough.
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:01.160]  Let's talk comfort.
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:07.160]  Let's talk about down home value made in the USA blue jeans like you
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:08.160]  wore as a kid.
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:15.160]  Remember, there's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:22.160]  gusset jeans.
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:27.160]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:31.160]  Put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:35.160]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:37.160]  We're good old fashioned comfort.
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:39.160]  Get diamond gusset jeans.
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:40.160]  Every stitch guaranteed.
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:44.160]  And our Defender motorcycle gene comes Cavalier reinforced.
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:51.000]  Become a gusested.com that's gusset.com or call
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.060]  888-the family
[01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:55.320]  Summary
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:59.840]  There are more places in the world to go to them.
[01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:12.760]  lengthy conversation.
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:15.780]  a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.

[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:09.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:22.280]  54 days out, the most historic election in world history.
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:27.160]  You're listening to the most banned, demonized, lied-about transmission in the world because
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:34.280]  we're pro-human, we believe in you, we believe in Jesus Christ, and we believe in human future,
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:35.280]  human victory.
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:40.040]  People ask, why don't we listen to Elon Musk and all these other big tech guys, and
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:44.040]  it's everything you said 20 years ago, because I was reading white papers that the globalist
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:49.320]  put out about an anti-human, post-human future, and I'm like, wow, this really sucks, I believe
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:52.320]  in humanity.
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:55.360]  Owen Troyer's here, riding shotgun with me, and we're going to open the phones up in the
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:56.360]  next hour.
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:34:04.160]  Owen, just recapping this, 200,000 dead in Mexico the last few years, total collapse,
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:09.600]  big warrior armored vehicles, and 18-wheelers ramming people, machine gun death everywhere,
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:10.600]  mask raves.
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:15.040]  Like I said, thousands of illegals found dead in 18-wheelers, it gets like five seconds
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:16.040]  of news.
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:20.960]  Oh, we found 67 dead people, including 12 kids, the back of an 18-wheeler in San Antonio,
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:23.000]  big frickin' deal, move on.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  That's the dehumanization.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:30.440]  Oh, they love Hispanics so much all day, but when that's happening, it's not in the news
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:32.000]  because they're collapsing the country.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:37.520]  It's the UN Global Sorrows Plan to collapse nation-states just like they're doing in Europe.
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:39.680]  This is 21st century war.
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:42.640]  This is how the globalists target you.
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:46.280]  So Owen, tell people about the church, we'll play the clip, we'll get into it, you decide,
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:50.320]  oh, they've got a congressperson, a Democrat, who's pushing this, you saw him beat that
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:52.400]  little girl, you know, he raped her too.
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:56.200]  And the guys will say that, no, she was never separated from mother.
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:59.320]  She hadn't eaten in 12 hours, they were out of food and water.
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:03.200]  She's been in the desert for days.
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:07.720]  Mommy ran away from daddy, and the word is, because mommy makes some money coming up to
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:08.720]  the border.
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:12.120]  Oh, wonder what, yeah, the booktroll's kind of nice now, they're like, let's take this
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:17.600]  satchel and say this wasn't here, because it's just, it's totally lawless.
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:23.560]  And so, oh, he looms over her, what a meanie, never taken from her family.
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:26.560]  Systems set up by ACLU 20 years ago.
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:30.680]  So you go down there, and you're like, hey, we've got a thousand plus armed men at one
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:35.080]  ranch with machine guns in Camel, what the hell?
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:39.720]  And in crime waves everywhere, and they're saying, oh, you don't even exist anymore,
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:43.880]  kind of like Rubio said to me, it's this leftist, make-believe Alistair Crowley crap.
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:44.880]  Go ahead.
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:48.200]  We'll hear that in a clip in just a second, but here's what bothered me, Alex, it's like
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:49.200]  what you're talking about.
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:55.520]  They're gonna have this panel, and they're gonna have emails nationwide, the ACLU, everything,
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:36:01.760]  all this crap over fake news, fake news, that Trump is putting kids in cages, and that Trump
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:04.320]  is responsible for separating families of borders.
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:09.520]  100% fake news, they know it's fake news, but they have these panels and discussions and
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:10.520]  email changes.
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:13.680]  And it's photos from the Obama era, because they hadn't beefed up the stuff yet.
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:14.680]  So I just-
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:15.680]  Now it's quite nice.
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:17.440]  So actually, Candace Owen shot a great video.
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:21.760]  She went to one of the family detention centers in Florida, said it's nicer than any public
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:23.160]  school she's ever seen.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.160]  So they actually-
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:27.520]  I mean, I saw the food they're eating, I guess they got the board patrol cooking, that looks
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:28.760]  like some damn good megas.
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:33.800]  No, they get yoga classes, they got all kinds of stuff, recreation centers, everything,
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:34.800]  so that's great.
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:37.040]  The average stay is 48 hours.
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:40.280]  And so they get a better treatment than the average public school student in America.
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:41.760]  It's awful for them, bad on us.
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:50.000]  But so I'm sick of them dominating their little thought spectrums with fake news, so I say
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.040]  okay, I'm gonna go film this, and we'll show the people what these people talk about behind
[01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:57.720]  the scenes, and I'm gonna inject my point, and I'm gonna say, look, you guys just talked
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:02.200]  about fake news for an hour, here's real news, I got a stack of stories here, I'm gonna leave
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:03.200]  it for you.
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.920]  Can I please get an answer from my congresswoman?
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:11.280]  So the story is, I see the video of the men coming across the border in fatigues and rucksacks
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:16.040]  and rifles and everything, and that's like, okay, okay, here's info wars, we have to blow
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:17.040]  this up.
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:18.040]  I thought I was looking at World War I footage.
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:19.040]  So it's like-
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:21.720]  I mean, it's dudes on horseback with machine guns, a thousand.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:25.800]  So if no one's gonna cover it, then we have to cover it, and then as I want, I mean, I'm
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:28.080]  never gonna ask the Info Wars Army to do anything I won't do.
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:29.080]  So I won't-
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:30.080]  Explain Info Wars Army.
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:31.080]  We want everybody to peacefully, lawfully.
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:34.480]  We had folks threaten us to go, oh, there'll be a false flag of Info Wars Army.
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:35.480]  That'll be an operative.
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:40.120]  We're peaceful, our mission is clear, go out, speak out, expose what's going on, go to these
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:44.600]  congresspeople's meetings, go in, videotape it, live stream it, send it to us, upload
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:48.840]  it, whatever, and bring this up to them that, hey, that little girl wasn't separated from
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:49.840]  her parents.
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:52.480]  It was an ACLU-era deal from 25 years ago.
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:54.240]  How dare you lie?
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:56.400]  So again, describe who the congressperson was.
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:57.400]  And if you do-
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:59.800]  If you change one person's mind at one of these meetings, it's worth it.
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:04.760]  It was Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia, and I asked her about this.
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:05.760]  Nobody wanted to answer my question.
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:06.760]  They kicked me out.
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:07.960]  They bragged about Alex Jones being the platform.
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:09.120]  Guys, do we have the video ready?
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:10.600]  Let's just go.
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:14.880]  This is me last night at a liberal event at Central Presbyterian Church, where they're
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:16.080]  blaming Trump for the separation.
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:17.800]  And again, I can't tweet this.
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:19.720]  Everybody else, you have to tweet it.
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:20.720]  Yeah.
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:21.720]  You have to re-upload it.
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:23.440]  There's no copyright on anything we do.
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:24.440]  Get it out there.
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:25.440]  Here it is.
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:26.440]  Yeah.
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:27.440]  Is it Ms. Garcia?
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:28.440]  Right?
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:29.440]  Is that-
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:30.440]  Right.
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:32.440]  Is that just spoke Senator Garcia?
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:36.480]  Yeah, you just said that we should stop, you know, the family detention and all the harm
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:37.720]  that's being done to these families.
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:42.480]  But don't you think, don't you think actually doing something about the border would be the
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:43.480]  best option?
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:44.480]  You say you want to keep terrorists out.
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:46.040]  I have a stack of news.
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:48.400]  I brought a copy for everyone here today.
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:54.800]  There was video of armed men walking right across the border, dozens of them in military
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:55.800]  uniforms.
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:57.400]  So that doesn't help anyone.
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:59.840]  That doesn't help immigrants that want to come here legally.
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:02.800]  And I'm just curious, you know, if we want to stop family detention and all this horror
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:06.280]  that you're talking about, why don't we actually secure the border?
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:08.080]  I think that that would be the best option.
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:09.080]  And if you want to also stop-
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:10.880]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:16.900]  It's the lawlessness of the border that allows the lawlessness in Mexico are not letting the
[01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:21.160]  border be controlled and letting the drugs and crime and people come across is what created
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:25.680]  the criminal wild West situation.
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:28.160]  They all major studies admit this.
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:31.040]  So again, of course you need to shut that down.
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:32.640]  That's what will clean that up.
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:36.720]  And isn't it more obvious than ever when you have a video like this with just thousands
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:37.720]  of armed men?
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:41.000]  I mean, how can you get away with that unless there is no border total lawlessness?
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:48.320]  And again, they have a Amos International study, 80%, I think it's 87.
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:49.320]  Look it up.
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:55.800]  80 plus percent of women and little girls as Leon is five are raped when they cross by
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:56.800]  the coyotes.
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:01.680]  And again, it's not Don Johnson in machete shooting the pregnant Mexican.
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:03.640]  It's the cartels doing it.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:07.040]  And so again, that's Hollywood and it's their family that sends them.
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:08.600]  They say separation of family happens in the border.
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:13.160]  So their family sends their daughters with emergency contraceptives because they know
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:15.280]  they're going to get raped.
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:17.760]  So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, type that in.
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:18.760]  There it is.
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:25.640]  80% of Central American women girls are rape crossing the U.S. from Mexico Huffington Post.
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:26.640]  But they ignore that.
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:27.640]  So let's go back to the video.
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:28.640]  Let's go.
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:29.640]  I'm sorry.
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:30.640]  It's just it's total truth.
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:31.640]  Go back.
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:37.920]  Man walking right across the border, dozens of them in military uniforms.
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:39.080]  So that doesn't help anyone.
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:41.520]  That doesn't help immigrants that want to come here legally.
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:44.480]  And I'm just curious, you know, if we want to stop family detention and all this horror
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:47.920]  that you're talking about, why don't we actually secure the border?
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:49.760]  I think that that would be the best option.
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:53.920]  And if you want to also stop baby prisons, maybe we should stop abortion centers too
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:54.920]  from killing them.
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:55.920]  Okay.
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:57.920]  Well, I think info is here.
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:58.920]  So.
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:40:59.920]  Next question.
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:00.920]  Well, that's fine.
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:02.420]  You guys can discount me.
[01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:07.560]  I will leave the stack of news for you video, video, Senator, are you going to do anything
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:09.760]  about a video of armed men?
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:10.760]  Excuse me, sir.
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:11.760]  I have a right to free speech.
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:12.760]  This is a senator.
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:14.160]  I'll leave the stack of news.
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:15.360]  You guys can look at the videos.
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.160]  I'm going to put it right here.
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:23.080]  Armed men, armed men in military uniforms, armed men in military uniforms.
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:26.280]  And this I'd like you to comment from my senator and you guys want me to go.
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.280]  Senator, will you please give me a comment?
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:34.280]  Sir, if you just read the information here, we have to look at it, I'm not seem to be
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:39.720]  I mean, she knows Mexico, the state war zone and they always play down.
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:40.720]  Thank you.
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:41.720]  Thank you.
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:42.720]  Thank you.
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:43.720]  Appreciate it.
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:44.720]  Thank you.
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:45.720]  Thank you.
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:48.000]  These are armed men, ladies and gentlemen in military uniform.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  Dozens of them.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:54.600]  Well, I just think it's ridiculous that you've got a clip of the video.
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:55.600]  That's a year.
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:56.600]  It's thousands.
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:59.080]  Family separation starting long before Trump.
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:02.320]  In fact, Trump is the only president to do anything about it.
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:04.360]  He signed an executive order to stop it.
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:05.960]  No other presidents do that.
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:08.240]  This is sad that you guys fall for this brainwashing.
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:10.160]  You should check up on it.
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:14.200]  We should do something about the border, not President Trump trying to save this country.
[01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:15.200]  Yeah, bye.
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:16.200]  You're welcome.
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.200]  You're welcome for informing you all.
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:21.400]  Oh, really, we lost our platform, sir.
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:25.280]  So this man is now celebrating free speech dead in America and I got news.
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:29.040]  Our web traffic is up 10 fold, 10 fold.
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:30.040]  You guys are losing.
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:31.040]  That's why you're really happy.

[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:42.880]  Total.

[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:47.320]  When I brought up stopping abortion, how that's when they all first shrieked.
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:48.960]  Doesn't that tell you everything?
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:52.560]  Why don't you guys stop abortion if you care about kids?
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:54.720]  I mean, that tells you everything, Alex, right there.
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:55.720]  Amazing.

[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:40.040]  saw, been in trouble with the law since the day they was born, straightening their curves,
[01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:56.800]  taking their way, the only way they know how, that's just a little bit more than a whole
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:57.800]  lot.
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:00.200]  I'm a good old boy, my mama loves me.
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:03.040]  Nothing like some good old country on the open road, huh?
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:08.400]  Absolutely, you ever see these guys that strut around, try to act big and tough and you look
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:14.640]  at them and it seems annoying, like they're trying to act like an alpha male, but maybe
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:19.040]  I was the person that was cowed because it's up to us that our alpha males actually care
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:20.040]  about society.
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:26.240]  They don't let the weird little twisted beta males who crave power dominate us, and they
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:29.360]  know that we have a conscience so they manipulate us, so here's an example.
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:34.240]  I've got, I'm not bragging about it, it's actually freakish, my neck is freakishly large,
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:39.560]  it's 20 inches and it's not fat, and my chest is freakishly large, I mean my chest is almost
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:40.560]  as big as Arnold Schwarzenegger's.
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:45.800]  Okay, then I got a big belly too, but the whole point is, is that ever since high school,
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:48.840]  like big tough guys would say, oh you're a punk, you want to fight, well you walk around
[01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:51.400]  with your chest stuck out, and I was like, no, I'm just standing up straight, I'm not
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:54.040]  standing up straight, I'm not standing up straight, it looks ridiculous.
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:58.920]  And so the point is, is that my, so since I was a teenager, I kind of like, act like
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:02.360]  I'm a little wizard, and when I walk around I kind of just do like this so people don't
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:06.360]  recognize me or mess with me, but you know what, now that people attack me for the first
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:09.000]  time in my life, it's not an arrogance, it's a pride.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.440]  Now I went walking into a grocery store this morning, I actually walked like a man supposed
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:16.320]  to walk, and everybody was looking at me, and they were like, damn that guy looks like
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:20.440]  a badass, and the whole point was, all of that now is the fact they're attacking me
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:24.440]  and I'm more proud than I've ever been, and I don't say like I was ashamed of myself before,
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:29.080]  I wasn't trying to stand out before, because I was already confident, but now that they
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:33.160]  want to come boo at me at tables, and boo at me on the street, and take that down, and
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:39.080]  like, you know, let's be like 18, try to make me ashamed of myself, now because they're
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:44.240]  doing that, now I'm going to actually hold my head high.
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:49.080]  So now I walked into the hotel the other night to this interview, and I walked right in there,
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:53.240]  and I walked through my head up, chest out, everything else, every woman basically came
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:58.080]  running, and again, it's not bragging about, oh I'm this tough guy, I'm handsome, it's
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:03.320]  not that, it's confidence, it's that America has the will, has the spirit, has the destiny,
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:10.440]  has the future, but those of us that are strong, we are reserved, because we're almost embarrassed
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:14.400]  by our power, and I'm saying now's the time to use the power, so from now on I'm not walking
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:18.400]  around hunchback, trying to hide anymore, I'm going to walk around, not sticking my
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:21.520]  chest out, but just standing up straight, this is what I look like when I stand up
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:26.040]  straight, okay, I'm going to start walking around like this, because I'm proud of what
[01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:30.520]  I've done, people say, oh you're a loser, oh you've been de-platformed Owen, oh Trump's
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:34.480]  being, it's all this lie that Trump's fake, Trump's not real, Trump's an idiot, Trump
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:40.800]  stands for nothing, because he stands for everything, it's all a damn lie, I mean do
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:41.800]  you see what I'm saying?
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:45.600]  Well and if they think we're going to stop because they're going to try to de-platform
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:48.800]  us, then they don't understand what we're doing here, they don't understand our mission,
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:51.520]  they don't understand what we're fighting for, we're not fighting for attention, we're
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:54.360]  not fighting for fame, we're not fighting for fortune, we're fighting for freedom, we're
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:57.560]  fighting for truth, we're fighting for America, we're fighting for justice, we're fighting
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:51:01.120]  for common sense to return to this country.
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:04.720]  But Alex, I mean you are a badass, you don't have to say, oh I'm kind of bad, you are a
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:05.720]  badass.
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:08.720]  Oh I've had my ass kicked plenty of times, usually when I was in the wrong, but the point
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:14.120]  is, is that, it's not like I'm even embarrassed, it's like I don't want attention.
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:18.000]  But people always ask me, it's like how can you go into a crowd of those people and be
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  too confused?
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.440]  Because you have something, explain that, they think we're losing by being attacked
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:25.280]  by the world, we're here to change the world, and I'm not comparing myself to Christ, but
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:29.960]  we're all trying to be Christ-like, Christ came to stand up and say no to the power structure
[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:32.960]  and then put it all on the line as an example, and that's what we're supposed to do.
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:37.960]  People say we're losing, no, we're dominating, we're blitzing the hell out of them, explain
[01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:41.920]  that to them, explain how you march into crowds of these people that hate you and lie about
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:45.600]  you, because you're trying to save them, you know what they're saying is a fraud, just
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:50.000]  like Hitler said America sucked and the Japanese said America was bad, no we didn't start those
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:54.480]  wars, and we weren't perfect with the idea, of course Hitler said we were bad, you think
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:52:01.040]  my grandfathers or your great grandfathers listened to Axis Power BS, do you think they
[01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:03.160]  heard the broadcast that came in?
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:08.240]  They laughed at it, we should laugh at these people too, but they're an enemy within trying
[01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:09.240]  to suppress us.
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:14.400]  Well it's really easy to be confident going into a group of these people unfortunately
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:18.800]  because if you arm yourself with the truth, if you arm yourself with information, and
[01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:23.480]  more importantly if you arm yourself with Jesus and God, and you go into these crowds
[01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:27.520]  you cannot be defeated, as long as you don't back down and have confidence, you cannot
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:32.240]  be defeated by these people, and they probably think that they had some sort of faux victory
[01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:36.200]  over kicking me out, well guess what, I had a viral video that's going to be seen a million
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:41.600]  times and your little event will have no impact on the world, and so they have these faux
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:43.120]  victories, but if you just go into these-
[01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:46.920]  Well that's it, they're all about how they're winners and we're losers and they follow every
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:51.720]  tyrannical program, they're not liberals, they're authoritarians, and the only reason
[01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:55.360]  I told this story about my life, like not trying to walk around, you know like you walk
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:59.560]  around the grocery store standing up straight and it's kind of embarrassing, you know like
[01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:02.480]  walk around like you're trying to be one of those big guys, but I am a big guy so I shouldn't
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:05.760]  be embarrassed of it, and I'm just saying I'm not going to hunch over and hide anymore,
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:08.360]  but they've actually made me come out of my shell.
[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:13.080]  Actually this is an interesting path to go down Alex because there's this whole trend
[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:17.280]  right now happening about body shaming, right, and so it's like if you're overweight and
[01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:22.440]  obese, like they want you to show off your body, like I mean women are wearing like yoga
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:26.920]  pants now, I mean it should almost be illegal, but like if you're actually in shape like
[01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:31.320]  a fit guy, like sometimes Alex it's like weird, like I feel bad like if I go out in a muscle
[01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:32.320]  shirt walking-
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:33.320]  That you're in great shape.
[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:34.320]  And there's like a bunch of-
[01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:36.360]  What do you like, three percent body fat?
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:42.040]  Probably something like that, maybe four or five, depending on the day, but it's like
[01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:45.320]  if you walk around in a muscle shirt and you're a big tough guy or whatever, like you're
[01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:48.680]  kind of like, oh yeah, thanks for rubbing it in, you know what I'm saying?
[01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:52.560]  But if you're someone overweight that just chooses to be overweight and then chooses
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:56.320]  to scoot around on the store on your scooter instead of walking and stuff like that, like-
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:54:00.400]  Oh it's like one of the Antifa meetings, these women go, I love Satan, I kill my babies
[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:04.160]  and I stink, and they hold their arms up and there's this blubber and like hair hanging
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:05.160]  down.
[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:09.360]  It's like you're not supposed to be proud of your physical condition if it's good, you're
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:13.560]  only supposed to be proud and boast about your physical condition if it's unhealthy.
[01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:19.000]  Well my point is that I was real good looking when I was young and so I noticed people,
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.760]  men started fights with me if I was good looking and strutting around.
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:24.760]  I wasn't trying to strut, I learned to not strut around because I don't want attention.
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:29.360]  And I'm just saying now with all the things it's like in this climate, now I'm going to
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:30.960]  start strutting around.
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:35.760]  Because I want those people to know that I'm going to strut around in front of them because
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:37.760]  I'm not going to bow to them.
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:39.080]  And here's what it is.
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:40.080]  One is Alex Jones.
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:41.080]  Now I am Alex Jones.
[01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:42.080]  You are Alex Jones.
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:43.960]  You have to go to these events.
[01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:48.800]  One patriot armed with the truth, armed with information, armed with facts and armed with
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:52.320]  God will defeat an entire crowd of these people.
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:56.480]  And I bet of the 50 people that were at that event last night, I bet you I changed one
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:57.480]  person's mind, Alex.
[01:54:57.480 --> 01:54:59.800]  I bet you one person in that 50 people's...
[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:03.680]  I think more than that because they all deep down know it's a lie, they know America doesn't
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:08.280]  hate Hispanics, they know Latin America's collapsing, they know it's a dangerous satanic war zone
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:11.520]  and then how the hell can they come up with this and say that we're the bad guys?
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:12.520]  Well, what are we going to do?
[01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:17.480]  I mean, how can I compete, you know, Beto O'Rourke, a fake name, they put Beto in his
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:20.880]  name to, you know, make him, you know, voteable.
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:24.320]  They think Hispanics will just, oh, vote, vote, vote, it's like Sylvia Garcia.
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:25.320]  Is that your real name?
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:26.320]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:30.560]  These Democrats, they always manipulate anyway to get votes, but Beto O'Rourke plays a concert
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:31.560]  with Willie Nelson.
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:36.000]  So Willie Nelson is now promoting Beto O'Rourke to defeat Ted Cruz, which is bad.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.640]  Ted Cruz is a great voting record.
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:42.640]  Beto O'Rourke is an anti-conservative, anti-Trump liberal nut job, phony Democrat.
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:43.640]  So what am I going to do?
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:44.640]  I can't compete with Willie Nelson.
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:45.640]  Wait a second.
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:46.640]  Maybe I can.
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:47.640]  I have to.
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:48.720]  I have to compete with Willie Nelson.
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:53.280]  I have to make sure that Ted Cruz gets in, not because I'm some fanatic of Ted Cruz,
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:56.880]  because he's going to vote for America, because he's going to be real.
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:56:01.080]  Beto is a literal moron idiot and everyone must vote for Ted Cruz.
[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:04.440]  Ted Cruz got dirty in the campaign, which made me hate him more because he was so good
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:05.440]  as voting record.
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:06.440]  He's so smart.
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:07.440]  He really has one of the best voting records.
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:09.720]  And then he turned to this lying jerk during the campaign.
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:10.720]  It doesn't matter.
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:12.720]  He's a trillion times better than Beto.
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:13.720]  Bingo.
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:14.720]  Bingo.
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:16.960]  And that's why this midterm election is so important.
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:21.000]  Just even if you have to hold your nose and vote Republican, look, I'm not a Republican,
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:22.000]  but my God.
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  Well, you can't hold your nose.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  The Democrats are pure evil.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.960]  Let me plug or want to go bankrupt here because this is important to do five more minutes
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:27.960]  with us.
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:28.960]  The other guest choice.
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:33.200]  Folks, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing.
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:36.200]  I put out bodies, ultimate tumor formula.
[01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:38.200]  It's got 95 curcuminoid.
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:40.760]  I got one of the top labs in the country even concentrate more.
[01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:43.040]  They can barely do it at 95%.
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:44.440]  I want you to have the best.
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:45.440]  Okay.
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:46.440]  Well, it's the same thing with X2.
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:47.440]  It's the purest iodine out there.
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:50.840]  And yes, like I told you six months ago, I did a big order.
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:52.280]  I try to get the price down.
[01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:54.000]  These oil companies have been gouging us.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:55.480]  It is cost prohibitive.
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:56.480]  They have slowdowns.
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:00.280]  They're messing with me because that's where it comes from, deep earth mining.
[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:02.160]  This is the last run of Surveillance Shield X2.
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:04.200]  So we hope there's a new formulation.
[01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:06.920]  We hope we're able to get a source, but I just get tired of being put over a barrel
[01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:09.040]  and, you know, them taking six months to get it to us.
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:10.040]  So it'll be a long time.
[01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:11.400]  We'll get more X2 in if we ever do.
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:12.400]  I think this is the last run.
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:16.480]  I think technically we've got a new supplier yet to change the name anyway.
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:25.120]  So infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com, or AAA 253-3139, infowarstore.com.
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:28.360]  Get your X2 before it's all sold out.
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:32.280]  Final run of X2, the amazing product, infowarslife.com, a lot of the specials there as well.

[02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:31.960]  Civilization is great, chivalry is great, but they took Christian chivalry and the
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:35.600]  globalists used it to get us to advocate our responsibility and let them take control when
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:39.760]  they're totally ruthless and they're fundamentally baitish.
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:43.400]  Twisted bait is what I call them, so they want to dominate strength and you look at
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:47.640]  this one of the last issues of Enforced Magazine, it was a great success, it just time and energy
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:48.960]  we couldn't do anymore.
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:52.600]  The war on men, this came out like three years ago.
[02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:59.080]  Now it's all totally public, it's all totally admitted, so in closing before our next guest
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:06.280]  joins us with some key information, I've looked at all the angles on this and told me to disagree,
[02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:09.840]  they can't get rid of Trump now because it will derail them even more as a lot of top
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:14.040]  globalists like Panetta and others and Hayden have warned them, but that's not who they're
[02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:15.040]  listening to.
[02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:20.440]  The Deep State, the Chai Coms, others, the Yunker, they think they're invincible because
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:25.160]  they had power so long, yeah, because we were asleep and so they keep trying to intimidate
[02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:31.320]  like Hitler bombing London, it doesn't intimidate, it pisses people off and energetically you
[02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:37.440]  can feel the rage, the focus, but they're trying to cause a violent revolution, Trump
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:43.760]  Arrangement Syndrome has gone into overdrive now and just the next 54 days are so incredibly
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:46.920]  critical for everybody to realize how important they are.
[02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:50.400]  They think we're a bunch of betas, we're if they take us off this, take us off that, we
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:54.720]  all get demoralized and go away, no, we fight that much harder, they're trying to deplatform
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:57.440]  us because they can't beat us intellectually.
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:01.680]  So just in the three months we have left, let's not be too confident though, what do
[02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:06.680]  we have to watch, what's their curve balls, what's that shot coming from nowhere, what
[02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:08.320]  do they got up their sleeve?
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:13.240]  Well, the violence is something that they've already been doing, so maybe they continue
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:19.760]  to try to ratchet that, maybe they continue to try to ratchet that up, they got a gauntlet,
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:23.400]  but very ready a listener, you have to see this, go ahead, sorry, but I think that it's
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:30.460]  more of a battle for the future right now where they want to scare and intimidate anybody
[02:02:30.460 --> 02:02:34.920]  in the future from running for office as a Republican, that's why they're stabbing Republicans,
[02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:39.040]  threatening to stab Republicans, shooting Republicans, you know, stalking Republicans,
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:41.320]  that's why you've got all the violence against Trump supporters.
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:45.000]  That Breitbart 567, we've sent them dozens that they don't have on there, they don't
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:46.000]  put them on there.
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.400]  Well, actually I got in touch with the guy, he did put two of ours on there, and then
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:54.320]  the problem was, excuse me, the others that I sent him were removed from YouTube, and
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:55.840]  so they liked it.
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:58.600]  And that's what they target is showing how hard the left is.
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:01.560]  Exactly, exactly, which is of course, all their misbehavior.
[02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:05.720]  Which was the last videos that were up on the Alex Jones channel before they removed
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:08.120]  you, before you went live that day, was all this stuff from-
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:10.360]  So we need to re-upload those on our own platform?
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:15.960]  Well, and then I did that, and then they banned me, which, which, I mean, you know, so it's
[02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:20.080]  fine, but that's why, and Alex, again, this is why I started the infor-
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:22.960]  Well, there's no shortage of these miscreants, though.
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:27.200]  People need to understand, okay, all right, if they remove Alex Jones' voice box, you
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:29.120]  are Alex Jones, you have to go be Alex Jones.
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:32.840]  By the way, we're not just saying that, they've bet they can silence you, they've bet that
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:36.160]  when they try to ban you or mess with you, you'll go away.
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:40.280]  No, right on the bathroom wall, we're in a war, folks, you know, don't think you're legal,
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:43.240]  don't clump on billboards at night and spray-print-in-forwards.com over it.
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:46.880]  I mean, it's time to get aggressive, folks.
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:47.880]  And again-
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:48.880]  Time for civil disobedience.
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:52.720]  They are not allowing you, they are not allowing us, they're not allowing Alex, heck, they're
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:58.440]  not even allowing Trump and Republicans from, from getting a fair shake on the digital platform.
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:03:59.720]  It's really not even close.
[02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:00.720]  So what do we do?
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:05.280]  Well, let's go out into the real world where God is in charge, the 3D realm, our creator,
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:07.280]  and let's see if they want to try to banish from that.
[02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:10.280]  Because then that becomes a national news story, and then that fires up the base even
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:11.280]  more.
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:14.400]  You're going to ban people from putting up a free Alex Jones sign at a public event?
[02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:15.400]  Huh.
[02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:19.800]  Wow, we've really reached next level Chinese totalitarianism, then haven't we, and you've
[02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:23.480]  just created a story, and then we can force the mainstream news to cover it, because it
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:26.360]  doesn't matter how many platforms they erase us from.
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:31.400]  This show at Infowars.com still has millions of unique visitors every day.
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:35.280]  And then they're more activated, they're more energized, and I've always just tried to
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:38.160]  educate the general public, but now I've gotten even smarter.
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:42.920]  I just go directly, now that I have the big enough name to do it, but you don't, you know
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:46.600]  the policy makers, no, I'm dangerous, the globalists, they don't think I'm an idiot,
[02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:47.600]  like the liberals do.
[02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:48.600]  No, they listen.
[02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:49.600]  They don't want you in DC, do they?
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:56.480]  No, we're going to be there a lot now, we're coming, oh yes, oh no.
[02:04:56.480 --> 02:05:01.040]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula, or just want an alternative,
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:04.120]  Infowars Life has the formula for you.
[02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:08.720]  Ultimate Crill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA, and

[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:18.200]  Containing powerful antioxidants such as Azazanthin and Omega-3's, Ultimate Crill Oil can help
[02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:23.160]  you experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.

[02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:34.560]  maintain cognitive function, and more.
[02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:38.880]  And while other Crill Oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the
[02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:44.040]  benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality Crill Oil concentrate,
[02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:46.880]  paired with our ultimate fish oil, or used separately.
[02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:51.080]  It's time to see what Crill Oil can do for you with Ultimate Crill Oil, now available
[02:05:51.080 --> 02:06:17.080]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:36.960]  Certainly, for some, Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive, but if you can get through all
[02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:42.960]  that to explore what he has been saying, to see for yourself what it is that the establishment
[02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:49.720]  wants to hide from you, then the information you find could be life-changing.
[02:06:49.720 --> 02:06:59.720]  He predicted 9-11.
[02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:10.920]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony in Bohemian Grove.
[02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:16.040]  He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalism, a prison
[02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:19.840]  planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks.
[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:23.640]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg group at all.
[02:07:23.640 --> 02:07:32.640]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon
[02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:33.640]  Valley.
[02:07:33.640 --> 02:07:37.640]  They falsely edited him.
[02:07:37.640 --> 02:07:42.720]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:51.800]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video, and now he is being de-platformed
[02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:55.920]  by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[02:07:55.920 --> 02:08:00.640]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him, and then
[02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:04.360]  we get hit, say, even no longer use our software.
[02:08:04.360 --> 02:08:07.200]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:08.680]  We just got taken down by YouTube.
[02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:10.160]  They just killed our stream.
[02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:11.160]  Really?
[02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:12.160]  Yep.
[02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:16.000]  Americans are actually celebrating this.
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000]  This is America in 2018.
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:27.800]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:32.280]  Will you do nothing while history is being recorded?
[02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:34.560]  Will you sit and do nothing?
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:38.440]  Or will you do your own research?
[02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:42.600]  For the truth and stand for freedom.
[02:08:42.600 --> 02:09:11.880]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:28.040]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistant.
[02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:32.520]  This is the most banned, demonized, lied about broadcast in the world.
[02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:36.440]  Before I introduced my special guest, a really smart guy that's impressive, I thought about
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:39.000]  says at the start of the show today, but I didn't do it.
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:44.640]  I had Eric Boling here of CRTV and formerly Fox News, a really nice guy, smart guy, a
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:50.400]  big economist, big buddies with Trump, we're having some great off-record conversations
[02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:55.440]  that horrifies Southern Private Law Center and Soros and all of them.
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:59.440]  He talks to the president basically every day.
[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:03.480]  He was going, you know, they admitted Homeland was about you and this other show and another
[02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:05.480]  show and like, off air.
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:07.480]  And again, it's not about how I'm a big guy.
[02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:13.120]  It's like, why did they start when Hillary lost producing three Comedy Central shows
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:18.000]  admittedly based on me, but to misrepresent what I've said, I'm Alex Jones and I love
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:19.000]  the KKK.
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:23.200]  You know, that's Stephen Colbert two weeks ago, but then I'm banned off the internet,
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:25.560]  all these platforms, so I can't say that's ridiculous.
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:32.080]  Here I am protesting the KKK and saying I love Martin Luther King and what he said.
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:34.400]  That's the craziness we're dealing with here.
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:36.880]  So that's why they're taking me off all these things so I can't respond.
[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:39.960]  But it had the Streisand effect, kind of like you have a water balloon and you push this
[02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:42.120]  way onto social media, it's big.
[02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:46.120]  You take conservatives off or three thinkers off, it goes back the other way.
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:52.200]  And so they took us off here and all the traffic went back over here and about 7% extra.
[02:10:52.200 --> 02:10:58.480]  Well, if you count the first month, it's like three times, but, but it's true that it makes
[02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:01.680]  it hard for us to reach new people.
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:08.200]  So that's why I'm getting into the fact that why would they build me up like this?
[02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:12.120]  Because sure, I had one of the biggest radio shows and one of the biggest websites out
[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:14.560]  there, thanks to you and Drudge Report and all the guests.
[02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:17.320]  I mean, Enforce is you, it's not just me.
[02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:18.320]  But why did they ban it?
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:21.720]  Because you understand that, you understand like the Rosetta Stone, the skeleton key,
[02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:23.560]  it opens all the doors.
[02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:27.280]  They admit in these white papers and these WikiLeaks documents and these latest media
[02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:29.920]  matters documents that came out that were from last year, but came out a few months
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:31.320]  ago that got national news.
[02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:34.600]  They're, they're playing, you know, it's, it's, it's a big report.
[02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:39.720]  We've covered, they picked me because that could be taken on a context and they thought
[02:11:39.720 --> 02:11:41.880]  I was an easy target.
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:46.960]  So they built me up even bigger and then it backfired folks love the radicalness.
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:51.000]  They loved even the villainous, you know, everybody knows in professional wrestling
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:52.240]  that the villains are the most popular.
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:55.120]  I'm not really a villain, but they made me into a villain.
[02:11:55.120 --> 02:11:57.040]  These globalists have some blind spots.
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:01.320]  We got even more popular, especially young people.
[02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:05.360]  So even though I'm not that villain, they may, now they've got to destroy me.
[02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:10.280]  They're like, oh my God, we built Frankenstein and they don't know what to do.
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:12.280]  But again, they're still missing.
[02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:13.280]  It's the guest.
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:14.400]  It's you.
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:16.360]  That's what's really powerful.
[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:18.840]  And so that's why they're so scared.
[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:22.680]  And that's why you shouldn't take it as like, oh my God, I got kicked off Facebook or Twitter
[02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:27.480]  or I got banned or I got whatever because I promoted Alex Jones, you're going to be kicked
[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:29.040]  off anyways.
[02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:34.120]  The only work there is is standing up for what's right and breaking their will and breaking
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:36.560]  their stock and supporting us.
[02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:41.080]  So when I do a straight up pitch, as my guest said, he doesn't even want to come on here
[02:12:41.080 --> 02:12:44.080]  and do a pitch as the company I'm working with because they're so good.
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:49.200]  He said, I want to get into college scam than the college conspiracy, which is one of my
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:50.200]  biggest issues.
[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:54.240]  I learned about from Limbaugh like 25 years ago when I was out of high school listening
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:56.640]  to him, I guess in college.
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:59.000]  So we have our guest here.
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:00.000]  We're going to go to break.
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:01.000]  He's a surprise guest.
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:02.000]  I can tell you his name.
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:03.000]  We got a break.
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:04.000]  Come back with a moment.
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.880]  We're building the suspense here.
[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:11.840]  But that's what this comes down to is they want you dependent.
[02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:17.640]  I had the guest on yesterday who has nine of his books, one of them bestseller banned
[02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:21.240]  on Amazon in one day and I went look at the synopsis.
[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:23.800]  I read one of the books years ago.
[02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:25.040]  It's just milk toast.
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:26.800]  Don't let women push you around.
[02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:28.520]  They're not looking for a guy that's a beta.
[02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:29.880]  Let's them push him around.
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:31.320]  You're not their child.
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:32.720]  You're not their son.
[02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:33.880]  You're their boyfriend.
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:38.000]  You're their husband and how men need to be rugged again.
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:41.000]  Those books were banned because they were effective.
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:46.760]  They were true and they were going to number one.
[02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:47.760]  So think about that.
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:50.240]  So they want to bring you failure.
[02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:53.480]  They want to bring you college degrees that are beyond worthless.
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:54.480]  They're a negative.
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:57.440]  You're going to pay $100,000 for it and you're going to be back in groceries.
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:13:59.200]  There are some degrees that are worth something.
[02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:00.200]  We're going to get into those.
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:03.720]  So because it was my guest, I wanted him here because he's such a smart guy.
[02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:04.840]  He does such great work.
[02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:07.360]  We'll introduce him when we come back in the next segment.
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:09.680]  I'm building suspense here.
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:12.680]  But I want to empower you.
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:17.640]  I want you to be involved in things, whether they're supplements or information or whatever
[02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:24.560]  it is that is so great for you that we symbiotically have a future together.
[02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:25.560]  You want to come back.
[02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:27.960]  You want to get our products because they work so well for you.
[02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:32.040]  You want to come back because the information is so accurate and on so many topics, you
[02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:36.160]  want to know what they don't want you to know, what scares them.
[02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:38.200]  And that's really why we're so banned.
[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:40.400]  Our government really did sell out to communist China.
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:45.560]  Apple and Google have moved their tax exempt and help round up dissidents and kill them.
[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:46.840]  People go, man, you better watch your ass.
[02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:47.840]  They'll come after you.
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:48.840]  They're trillion dollar companies.
[02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:49.840]  No, I get it.
[02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:53.240]  I don't want to just be some timid soul that crouches down and licks their hand.
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:58.640]  So all I say is may your chain set lightly upon you as Patrick Henry said and give me
[02:14:58.640 --> 02:14:59.640]  a liberator, give me a death.
[02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:06.720]  So when we come back, Conrad Padilla, an amazing guy I'll introduce him, will get into the
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:17.120]  college conspiracy and the scam and the avenues that are proven, proven so that you can be
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:21.080]  way more successful than what they've tried it out for you because there's just a microcosm.
[02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:26.360]  I was 20 years old when I started Access Television because I was two years in college.
[02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:28.360]  It was all a bunch of crap.
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:30.560]  And within a year, I was already on local radio.
[02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:32.800]  I said, I want to be a salesman too.
[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:36.840]  And within a couple years, I was bringing in over a million dollars a year and able to
[02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:37.840]  build an operation.
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:38.840]  And that's what it's about.
[02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:41.960]  See, I'm not a globalist that wants to cut your legs off so I can be above you.
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:45.520]  I want to see you sure because I believe in the human spirit.
[02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:48.120]  I want to see you eclipse anything I've ever done.
[02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:51.680]  And we'll get into a big way for you to do that straight ahead, but it's up to you to
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:52.680]  take action.
[02:15:52.680 --> 02:16:00.280]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we're proud of our 100% grown and sewn

[02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:49.520]  satanic pedophile armies.
[02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:52.640]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:56.760]  against us, so we need your support.
[02:18:56.760 --> 02:19:01.240]  Infowarslife is launching its newest product, we're really, really proud of it.

[02:20:22.920 --> 02:20:31.920]  The
[02:20:31.920 --> 02:20:34.180]  desert's quite, leave lens cold.
[02:20:34.180 --> 02:20:38.260]  And so the story ends with T.
[02:20:38.260 --> 02:20:41.360]  Poncho needs your prayers is true.
[02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:46.400]  But save a few for Lefty too.
[02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:48.920]  He only did what he had to do.
[02:20:48.920 --> 02:20:51.560]  And now he's grown old.
[02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:59.000]  Hard to believe Merle Haggard died this year, last year, last year.
[02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:00.720]  Conrad Padilla is here.
[02:21:00.720 --> 02:21:04.760]  I'm really impressed with how smart he is, and I've got him here because we're doing
[02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:09.400]  a business venture together, but he doesn't want to get into that, and that's fine.
[02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:12.600]  He wants to get into the college conspiracy, and this is an example of this, but I want
[02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:19.040]  to get into infowarsyes.com because, you know, I don't do, it's all about the products.
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:22.880]  It's not about the home business and all that, but the last time I did this with another
[02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:27.120]  company that's got some really great products, their company grew sevenfold the next three
[02:21:27.120 --> 02:21:28.120]  years.
[02:21:28.120 --> 02:21:29.120]  They admitted it was me.
[02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:33.880]  So, I just want the listeners to know, obviously, this is something good to get in on the ground
[02:21:33.880 --> 02:21:38.200]  level of infowarsyes.com, just like I told you, Trump was good in to get into the beginning
[02:21:38.200 --> 02:21:42.560]  of it, and they're also not wimps to be sponsors and support us, so we like that, but I already
[02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:46.920]  heard about them for years, and then we were doing a lot of stuff in Europe.
[02:21:46.920 --> 02:21:51.560]  That's where they're in the top three companies in England and Germany and places, so that's
[02:21:51.560 --> 02:21:54.280]  perfect for our European invasion we're about to launch.
[02:21:54.280 --> 02:21:56.360]  I mean, you'll never know we launched it.
[02:21:56.360 --> 02:22:00.320]  I mean, the enemy listens to my phone, they know what we're doing, but let's just leave
[02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:01.320]  it at that.
[02:22:01.320 --> 02:22:02.320]  The European invasion will begin.
[02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:06.400]  The British invasion, you know, with the Beatles and stuff, we'll get ready for the
[02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:09.320]  American invasion with the Infowar, and I'm just going to stop right there.
[02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:12.920]  We've got world leaders involved, just enjoy it.
[02:22:12.920 --> 02:22:18.560]  There's real breadcrumbs, as one of us goes, we all go, but Conrad, Padilla, thank you
[02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:19.560]  for joining us.
[02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:20.720]  You've got the floor for the rest of the hour.
[02:22:20.720 --> 02:22:27.400]  Get into the college conspiracy, and I guess the colleges give you brainwashing and SJW,
[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:31.040]  because they want you to be all butthurt and crazy and a political operative, because your
[02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:32.280]  degree is going to be worthless.
[02:22:32.280 --> 02:22:33.280]  Right.
[02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:39.400]  Well, our whole system, Alex, teaches, go to school, get your higher education, and
[02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:42.760]  somehow you're going to go out there and get this job that's going to pay you a whole
[02:22:42.760 --> 02:22:43.760]  bunch of money.
[02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:47.160]  Well, what's happening right now is you've got kids right now who have master's degree
[02:22:47.160 --> 02:22:50.320]  that are working at Starbucks, and they're working in a bunch of different places like
[02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:53.800]  that, and they can't find the jobs that are out there, because everybody's doing the same
[02:22:53.800 --> 02:22:54.800]  thing.
[02:22:54.800 --> 02:22:55.800]  Now, there's a-
[02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:57.840]  And even the Huffington Post had mentioned it should be abolished.
[02:22:57.840 --> 02:23:00.200]  At 90%, you never get your money back.
[02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:01.200]  That's right.
[02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:03.840]  Well, the biggest problem we have right now is people don't realize the debt that's being
[02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:05.720]  accumulated by our government.
[02:23:05.720 --> 02:23:10.200]  The college debt that's happening right now that, in most cases, doesn't even have to
[02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:11.200]  be paid back.
[02:23:11.200 --> 02:23:12.200]  Well, somebody's going to have to pay it back.
[02:23:12.200 --> 02:23:17.040]  So, our system is teaching, go to school, get a higher education, get a bunch of debt,
[02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:19.760]  and then, by the way, you can't buy a house, and it's going to affect the way that you
[02:23:19.760 --> 02:23:22.200]  can actually, you know, effectively run in your life.
[02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:23.960]  So, they're literally putting a ball and chain on them.
[02:23:23.960 --> 02:23:24.960]  Well, they are.
[02:23:24.960 --> 02:23:25.960]  It's a denser servitude.
[02:23:25.960 --> 02:23:26.960]  Right.
[02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:27.960]  Right.
[02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:29.760]  And I think that's what the whole point is, is that our system's not teaching one of
[02:23:29.760 --> 02:23:32.200]  the most important things, which is entrepreneurship.
[02:23:32.200 --> 02:23:37.200]  You know, I look at entrepreneurship as, you know, some people have an issue with Trump
[02:23:37.200 --> 02:23:38.200]  being in the office.
[02:23:38.200 --> 02:23:43.880]  Well, Trump's an entrepreneur, and I think what the key to Trump is that, if you think
[02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:48.000]  about it, he's doing things, and there is a business guy, entrepreneur, and I think
[02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:49.000]  that's why so many-
[02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:53.160]  Yeah, he's not doing it for the bureaucracy to get more victims in college, more people
[02:23:53.160 --> 02:23:55.480]  on welfare, more people on the plantation.
[02:23:55.480 --> 02:23:57.800]  He's blowing off the doors of the slave plantation.
[02:23:57.800 --> 02:23:58.800]  Right.
[02:23:58.800 --> 02:23:59.800]  Well, he is.
[02:23:59.800 --> 02:24:02.800]  And that's why the professors, what's happening to professors right now is that, we hear about
[02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:06.880]  all the time with these professors, they're trying to program our kids and, you know,
[02:24:06.880 --> 02:24:09.920]  Trump this and Trump that, and the reality is, is that the reason they're saying that
[02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:12.600]  is because it goes against what they're about.
[02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:14.560]  They're not about entrepreneurship.
[02:24:14.560 --> 02:24:17.000]  They're not about individualism.
[02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:18.760]  They're about handicapped people they control.
[02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:19.760]  Well, they are.
[02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:23.640]  And so what's happening is, they're teaching socialism, but the problem is that when these
[02:24:23.640 --> 02:24:27.440]  kids get out there and they realize that socialism means high taxes, guess what happens?
[02:24:27.440 --> 02:24:31.320]  They're going to start realizing, maybe that whole socialism thing doesn't work like what
[02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:33.840]  that I was being taught when I was in college.
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:35.480]  Well, that's one of two things.
[02:24:35.480 --> 02:24:39.800]  Either they wake up and realize it's a scam or they get pissed and go, I want to pure
[02:24:39.800 --> 02:24:42.680]  socialist system, make it all free, make it Venezuela.
[02:24:42.680 --> 02:24:44.000]  You go, Hey, that doesn't work.
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:45.000]  They go, I don't care.
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:46.000]  I'm going to kill you.
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:47.000]  Right.
[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:50.680]  So, so my background, I spent, I spent 14 years on, on Wall Street.
[02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:52.840]  I did the higher education and did everything there.
[02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:57.880]  But what I found though, was that, you know, I was really time poor.
[02:24:57.880 --> 02:25:01.640]  And I found, and what I really found is that, that really what was happening with Wall Street
[02:25:01.640 --> 02:25:05.960]  is the lawyers and everybody else that was on there, they were really the ones that were
[02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:07.400]  controlling everything.
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:11.040]  So what I started realizing was, this is not what I want to do for the rest of my life.
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:14.800]  So this profession came around, you know, network marketing and MLM.
[02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:18.160]  As you know, sometimes people have a stigma of it with the reality is most people don't
[02:25:18.160 --> 02:25:21.840]  really actually know that it's been around for over a hundred years.
[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:26.640]  And what they, and what, what a lot of people don't actually realize is that this profession
[02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:28.280]  is so proven around the world.
[02:25:28.280 --> 02:25:31.720]  It's helped millions of people out the world go, be able to go into entrepreneurship.
[02:25:31.720 --> 02:25:33.880]  Well, mainstream media demonizes it.
[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:37.680]  There's some good company, some bad, but it's a model built around good products.
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:39.480]  That's why I've been offered hundreds of these deals.
[02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:40.480]  I've only done two.
[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:41.480]  Yeah.
[02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:45.120]  When it's a great product line, when it's already been successful, and then it just gives people
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:49.120]  a position to get other folks under them also outselling.
[02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:50.120]  Right.
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:53.400]  It's, it's, it's, and with products like, I mean, we should get rid of the products
[02:25:53.400 --> 02:25:55.680]  because it also funds the show now and it's a win-win.
[02:25:55.680 --> 02:25:58.120]  I mean, these are some of the best products out there.
[02:25:58.120 --> 02:25:59.120]  Well, they are.
[02:25:59.120 --> 02:26:02.880]  See, the, the, the reason that I was, what, when I became an independent distributor
[02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:07.200]  for Genes, the, the, the biggest thing that I liked about the company is that the owners
[02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:11.760]  of the company were, were successful business people before Genes.
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:13.800]  They already had, they were really successful people.
[02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:19.040]  They brought that stuff into the company and now they're one of the powerhouses worldwide.
[02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:22.480]  But what's great about, I think with, with, with respect to this, by the way, we had a
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:23.960]  bunch of that stuff in here.
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:28.160]  We just bring the Genes stuff back in here and the skin cream already had family and
[02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:29.720]  people that are already using it years ago.
[02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:30.720]  It's like, oh, you're with Genes?
[02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:32.360]  I mean, this is a big, big product line.
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:33.360]  Yeah.
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:36.400]  So when you look at all the products that they created, they're all designed to take
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:37.880]  care of the inside and take care of the outside.
[02:26:37.880 --> 02:26:40.440]  I mean, you know, let's think about this for a second.
[02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:41.440]  Okay.
[02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:42.440]  Who, who does it?
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:43.440]  Who wants bags underneath your eyes?
[02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:44.440]  Nobody.
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:45.440]  Okay.
[02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:46.440]  So that product right there.
[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:47.440]  I should use it.
[02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:48.440]  Yeah.
[02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:50.440]  That, that product right there, it's been on, you know, it's been on a lot of different
[02:26:50.440 --> 02:26:51.440]  shows, things like that.
[02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:52.640]  It works in a couple of minutes.
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:55.320]  You know, you get literally see the bags go away underneath your eyes.
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:58.800]  In fact, I, it looks like I can use some today actually myself.
[02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:01.600]  But the thing is, is that with all the products, they're all taking care of the inside.
[02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:02.880]  They're all taking care of the outside.
[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:06.680]  So it's not, these are not products that, you know, people are, when they run out, they're
[02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:09.960]  going to order more, you know, and that, and that's one of the best things about the business
[02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:13.000]  is that, you know, when people are out, they order more.
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:16.280]  And the cool part is that we're in 141 countries.
[02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:20.080]  So if you look at, if you look at a lot of these companies that are out there and billionaires
[02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:24.040]  that are out there, not one of them actually looks to have a business.
[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:28.480]  It's just going to be focused on one particular country, billionaires think worldwide.
[02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:32.640]  So it's great about the, and let me interrupt you and expand on that.
[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:36.240]  You've got to have an amazing product because you want people to reorder.
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:37.240]  It's a win-win.
[02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:38.240]  Right.
[02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:39.240]  It's a 360 non-zero sum game.
[02:27:39.240 --> 02:27:40.240]  Right.
[02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:43.740]  And you guys are already number one to number five in hundreds of, and I asked, why aren't
[02:27:43.740 --> 02:27:44.740]  you in the US yet?
[02:27:44.740 --> 02:27:49.040]  And he said, well, we're tailored towards really sophisticated audiences, which is true.
[02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:52.840]  And so you went into Europe and Asia first, now that's why it's ground level.
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:57.920]  You guys are now, even though you're a US company, you're now coming to the US last.
[02:27:57.920 --> 02:27:58.920]  Right.
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:01.320]  So the company primarily started in Asia, okay?
[02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:04.960]  So when the founders of the company started, they wanted to actually start the company
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:05.960]  in Asia.
[02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:06.960]  Now they're dominating.
[02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:10.200]  I mean, they're, you know, the company is doing, you know, billions, they've done billions
[02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:11.200]  of dollars in sales.
[02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:14.800]  I mean, they're, I think they're going to, they did 1.4 billion last year and maybe more
[02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:15.800]  this year.
[02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:16.800]  But the thing about it though.
[02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:21.600]  They're number one company of, quote, MLM, it's really about the product in some countries.
[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:22.600]  Yeah, it is.
[02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:28.000]  And what, well, right now they're actually, for momentum right now, worldwide, they're
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:31.200]  passing a lot of companies that are out there right now, but by far worldwide.
[02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:34.360]  But what they started in Asia, but what's happening here in the States right now is
[02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:37.360]  they're just on the verge of really opening up these markets here.
[02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:40.120]  And that's why I'm telling listeners, get the products, try them.
[02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:45.480]  Once you love them, which I know you will, then you can become a distributor, get discounts
[02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:47.120]  and make money and fund yourself.
[02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:49.560]  Yeah, this is a lot better than a worthless college degree.

[02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:47.600]  Yeah, wow who thought I mean it's not like the china model where it breaks before you get out of the box
[02:34:47.600 --> 02:34:51.600]  You know and it's a total piece. I remember when made America meant something
[02:34:52.400 --> 02:34:56.160]  So you have these amazing products. I want you to have the floor now because I'll rant and take over
[02:34:56.160 --> 02:35:00.800]  I know you were getting the college conspiracy and how they're trying to put you in a dead-end jobs and all the rest of stuff
[02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:07.440]  This sells yourself and you guys have supplements. You have energy, but like you said the women's products
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:13.840]  Uh, you know the people I know folks I talked to the workforce in England. They'd already have janez
[02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:19.200]  They're already into the skin cream your energy drinks. So so let's get into info wars. Yes.com
[02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:24.400]  Where you can get the latest best discounts, you know shopping cart system. They set up plugged right into them
[02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:30.320]  Uh, and then it that supports our broadcast and you can sign up and be distributors and be part of their u.s.
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:32.800]  Invasion this is smart. They started in the u.s.
[02:35:32.800 --> 02:35:39.120]  But they began in asia the big boom markets into europe and now the invasion of janez is beginning in the u.s
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:44.160]  And info wars. Yes.com. I think everybody should get it on the ground floor of this
[02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:48.400]  Updone one other company because they had such good supplements and they were
[02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:53.600]  Like 12 13 million dollars the first year when I got involved. They've been around for 15 years when I got involved
[02:35:54.080 --> 02:35:57.680]  They went something like 80 million after I've been doing it for a couple years
[02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:02.400]  So and of course we got a tiny pittance of that to fund our operation, which is okay
[02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:08.320]  The point is is that this is a great sponsor for us. It's a great business for you. I have my own supplements
[02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:11.760]  I have my own products that are excellent as well and I go out and find out whatever the best is
[02:36:11.840 --> 02:36:18.000]  Well, this is something that comes up to the info wars life standard and is a powerful ally for us
[02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:20.880]  You know to be another
[02:36:20.880 --> 02:36:26.400]  Hydra head, you know as they attack us. We're growing another head and it's chaness. It's info wars. Yes.com
[02:36:26.800 --> 02:36:31.520]  So conrad padilla, please take over. Okay, so when you look at when you look at all the products, alex
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:36.320]  I mean the basically you the the it's called the youth enhancement system and basically what it means is that
[02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:41.760]  Every product here has solutions. It's the solution to something. So for example, if you look at p.m. Right here
[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:44.240]  this product here
[02:36:44.240 --> 02:36:51.120]  Okay, 70 70 percent of americans have sleep issues 70 percent. So this product actually helps with
[02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:57.040]  People who have sleep issues. I will tell you this is probably my favorite product only because it's hard for me to unwind
[02:36:57.040 --> 02:36:59.040]  I'm one of those people that just goes goes goes
[02:36:59.680 --> 02:37:03.440]  And then of course the am what it does is it helps you with energy focus clarity
[02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:06.560]  But one of the products that you had talked about even was which is called mine
[02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:08.800]  In fact, a lot of the guys in here are using mind
[02:37:08.880 --> 02:37:14.160]  I mean we live in a society right now where who doesn't have a cell phone and who's not exposed to technology on a
[02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:16.240]  I mean literally all day long. I mean
[02:37:16.240 --> 02:37:19.840]  You know always last time you were with somebody and they're they're looking at their phone all the time
[02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:24.560]  And when we live in a society where attention to death attention deficit disorder is like all over the place, right?
[02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:30.480]  So the mind product what it really does is it really helps with focus and it helps with memory
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:36.320]  I mean, I don't know about you Alex, but sometimes what happens to is like some I mean I sometimes I forget things really easy
[02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:37.760]  I don't know if it's because I'm on my phone all the time
[02:37:37.760 --> 02:37:42.000]  Well, they've got studies they give you so many false choices that aren't real choices
[02:37:42.240 --> 02:37:46.320]  You can only make so many decisions in a day before you degrade any executive knows that
[02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:50.800]  And so just like Sean Parker or Facebook said he goes we give you all these fake choices
[02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:53.360]  That release all your dopamine that don't matter
[02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:57.760]  We're stealing your time when you should not be making all those decisions this quick
[02:37:57.760 --> 02:38:04.160]  So there's too many decisions we're being given and something like this boosts the cognitive ability to make more decisions
[02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:08.160]  Right. Well, and then if you look at reserve, okay reserve is a is right underneath it
[02:38:08.160 --> 02:38:12.560]  They're actually gel packs and what they basically are is they're super high antioxidants
[02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:18.000]  They're gel packs and what that does is it a combat combat stress. I mean who's not stressed
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:23.280]  It just blows you away. I'll say it. I mean we've got brain force which people love is excellent. I am jealous of this
[02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:27.840]  I mean I take mind all the time now if I've got to stay up particularly late
[02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:31.760]  Because I'm a tough person that doesn't need stimulants healthy stimulants early
[02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:36.320]  It's a later and then usually they make me kind of whacked out or I'm never mean to my wife unless I've
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:42.400]  You know had too much coffee too much. No, but this I'm not I'm not a jerk. Yeah, so why is mine different?
[02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:47.200]  Well, the the key to mine is obviously it's the it's the technology and that the Syracuse but
[02:38:47.200 --> 02:38:53.360]  The Syracuse basically what it what it does is it really it it helps with your focus it helps with your memory
[02:38:53.760 --> 02:38:56.160]  You know one of the fast and this has some of the same stuff that's in brain force
[02:38:56.160 --> 02:39:00.240]  It's just it's liquid and it's concentrated. Yeah, it goes in so it goes into your system really quick
[02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:03.680]  I mean the best thing that I think anybody could really do is when you go to you know
[02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:06.480]  Obviously go to m4s yes comm and when you go there
[02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:10.320]  There's some really really good videos on all of the different products that are here
[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:16.400]  I mean the videos are really incredible and it really gives you a general idea as far as really what each product does
[02:39:16.400 --> 02:39:20.480]  So that you can really make a decision as far as you know, how many you want to order things like that
[02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:26.720]  What is the best-selling product right now in the Genesee Empire reserve reserve which is the gel packs here at the bottom
[02:39:27.040 --> 02:39:31.680]  And I that's I haven't taken reserve. I'll be that's the problem with these great supplements. There's so many
[02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:38.720]  I've taken mind years ago. I've taken the the energy drink, which is incredible. My wife drinks those those are all over the place
[02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:42.720]  Uh, and and then I've and I did the eye cream a few times to test it and it really works
[02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:47.120]  I need to do it every day. I never so so wow. What does this do then? What is what does this do?
[02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:51.040]  So so it has acai in it. It's got green tea in it. It's got you know
[02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:53.920]  A lot of a lot of basically super fruits in it
[02:39:53.920 --> 02:39:58.480]  What it does is you know, we all know our the fruits that we get here now don't have the same punch anymore
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:03.040]  No, they don't I mean and so so what's great about this is that a lot of these fruits aren't from around here
[02:40:03.280 --> 02:40:08.960]  Like the acai berry comes from the brazilian rainforest and you know, these are you guys are wild harvesting. Oh, absolutely
[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:13.200]  Wild horse. Well, that was the next thing when I had the doctor one of your consultants on about this a medical doctor
[02:40:13.360 --> 02:40:15.520]  Yeah, is that I'm in supplement business
[02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:19.440]  So I know that most places the container has more cost than what's in it
[02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:23.360]  Yeah, and then I looked and I looked at the numbers. I had my my folks check it
[02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:28.320]  And they're like no that this place has like a hundred fifty percent markup others have a seven times
[02:40:28.320 --> 02:40:31.760]  That's what we do hundred fifty percent markup. You got to pay stuff. Yeah, that's what I'm saying
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:35.120]  You guys put a lot of that's why I'm partnering with you is it's my philosophy
[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:41.760]  Yeah, is actually give a reasonable price and then load it with product. Why why not have them have their socks knocked off
[02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:47.920]  I mean, I don't get the supplement companies that give you crap. Yeah, why would you not want to blow people away?
[02:40:48.080 --> 02:40:52.240]  Well, because they're not looking for they're not looking for ongoing people for to
[02:40:53.360 --> 02:40:59.360]  Basically or the products ongoing what what what's great about the genus product lines is exactly they want to do a big marketing campaign
[02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:02.720]  That's the and get you one time. That's no no we want you forever
[02:41:02.720 --> 02:41:07.360]  That's right. That's right. And that's why people if you look at genus and why they're doing these billions of dollars of sales
[02:41:07.360 --> 02:41:11.840]  Over the last few years is because people when they're out they reorder. Well, let me be honest in product control
[02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:15.920]  I had an idea to have knockout cost the same as a melatonin dose
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:20.480]  But at l-tripto fan of larian written much stuff and six or seven runs were great bestseller
[02:41:20.720 --> 02:41:26.400]  The latest run is okay, but my wife about three months ago goes. I'm not sleeping as good. This isn't as good
[02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:32.640]  Yeah, and I'm about to change formulators and do stuff because after like four years they I think somebody I'm gonna say their name
[02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:36.240]  Took me for granted and maybe we got some dried herbs. I don't know
[02:41:37.760 --> 02:41:41.920]  Knockout still is okay, but it ain't knockout anymore. So I'm a tell audience
[02:41:42.720 --> 02:41:46.400]  That's what I mean. It's the hassle of keeping the quality up. How have you done that?
[02:41:46.480 --> 02:41:50.720]  Right. Well, they first of all to get the right doctors to put the science together to make it happen
[02:41:50.720 --> 02:41:56.800]  Sure, I was with the manufacturers though because we'll get a formula. It's incredible and then suddenly a year later. It's happening on a few products
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:42:02.640]  It's like, well, this is not the same. Yeah, and then we discontinue it folks. We're about and I'm not putting down knockout. It still works
[02:42:02.960 --> 02:42:04.960]  Yeah, it's just not like
[02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:08.000]  Yeah, so when you go to it for word just calm when you go there
[02:42:08.400 --> 02:42:12.800]  The interview that you did with dr. Jam Papa's on there and dr. Jam Papa talks about a lot of the technology
[02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:18.080]  That's into the in the products with respect to it being transferred and and delivered and things like that
[02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:21.120]  So I think I think the key for you guys is just to understand that
[02:42:21.760 --> 02:42:26.960]  When you take this product it has a lot of punch and the reason has a lot of punches because it's not just developing the product
[02:42:26.960 --> 02:42:28.320]  It's also the shipment of the products
[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:31.760]  Sure. And and he was talking about how they also deliver it in stasis
[02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:36.240]  So it keeps the quality. By the way, I'm not a guy to put down our own products. I can only be honest
[02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:40.960]  Yeah, it's like knockout still helps some but it was like we had batches before that were like
[02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:46.480]  Knockout and now it's like so believe me. Believe me a new formulation is coming. I'm gonna get to the bottom of it
[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:50.080]  No one even complained. I noticed it. Okay, so that's what I'm talking about
[02:42:50.480 --> 02:42:52.800]  m4wars. Yes comm check it out

[02:47:32.320 --> 02:47:36.480]  I don't bring you information that I'm not hot on I'm gonna say this again
[02:47:37.440 --> 02:47:39.440]  I want to bring you winners
[02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:44.560]  If I was a car dealer, I'd want to sell whatever the highest rated car was
[02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:51.520]  That was the hottest selling and worked the best survived. Love me. I would not be selling, you know gremlins and pacers
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000]  You know, I would be I would be selling
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:48:01.760]  Um, toyotas and you know fords and our bluffs are pretty good. Yeah, and and and so that's what this comes down to so
[02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:04.960]  Yes, I want to do this as a hard pitch
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:09.440]  Our listeners need to know you guys are already one of the top companies worldwide
[02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:12.480]  You're now doing your big push into the us
[02:48:13.120 --> 02:48:17.520]  And I think people need to get fundamentally involved in this you guys are so successful
[02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:25.520]  And I was reading even in the different perspectives online in wall street that you're doing something because you're not an mlm company
[02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:31.600]  You're a skincare product energy company supplement lifestyle highest quality with medical doctors designing it
[02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:36.560]  But you use mlm as the model so folks have a way to get word of mouth the most powerful thing in the universe
[02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:38.800]  Especially in the censorship paradigm
[02:48:38.960 --> 02:48:44.480]  And so you guys are set to dominate in the united states. I'm just telling listeners
[02:48:44.480 --> 02:48:48.480]  I told you america was about to be great again. I told you trump was about to get novice
[02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:50.480]  I mean, that's why they hate us folks
[02:48:50.800 --> 02:48:57.440]  We know what's going on and people need to go to info wars. Yes.com to be part of this get great products a great business model
[02:48:57.920 --> 02:48:59.920]  You don't have to be a business person
[02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:02.080]  You don't have to be you don't have to be a distributor to get the product
[02:49:02.080 --> 02:49:05.600]  You can buy them straight up or get discounts to get them, but you guys have some deals
[02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:10.880]  Where where where if people show real interest in involvement, you're doing something
[02:49:10.880 --> 02:49:15.840]  No direct marketing company like you has ever done so we're talking about the products
[02:49:15.840 --> 02:49:21.840]  But also the business model is really the big product independence freedom everything this
[02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:26.080]  Folks have been offered hundreds of millions of dollars to support to support cryptocurrencies
[02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:31.360]  And and I get they're real and I get that they're just like the you know, our government has a fiat currency
[02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:36.640]  I've never taken any sponsorship from it because I can't figure it out and I can't guarantee
[02:49:36.640 --> 02:49:42.560]  There's not a pump and dump like you see cryptocurrencies down 80 percent this month. So I could have financed everything
[02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:48.480]  Off of cryptocurrencies and literally defeated Soros in the globalist, but I couldn't be sure
[02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:54.080]  You were going to get a good product. These are highest rated these. I know we're good
[02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:57.040]  So bare minimum you become a distributor you get discounts
[02:49:57.360 --> 02:50:00.240]  You sign up a few family members it pays for what you get each month
[02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:03.280]  Maybe you sign up a hundred members and you you know you make a million dollars a year
[02:50:03.280 --> 02:50:09.280]  The point is is that I feel good at a gut level promoting jenesse at info wars. Yes.com
[02:50:09.760 --> 02:50:14.880]  So that's what I'm saying here is this is a really sexy
[02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:17.040]  Uh
[02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:20.960]  Thing here that I at a movie grand day level feel good pushing
[02:50:21.120 --> 02:50:22.480]  That's why I'm thumbing at the mouth here
[02:50:22.480 --> 02:50:25.040]  So in the time we have in this segment the next get into
[02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:29.360]  The marketing angle the business angle the products are incredible. We'll get back into that
[02:50:29.360 --> 02:50:35.920]  But why I out of thousands of choices have picked jenesse. Well a couple things you said you number one cryptocurrencies
[02:50:35.920 --> 02:50:41.440]  I mean you look at you look at people right now people are starving to invest in something especially millennials
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:45.600]  The the challenge though Alex with with millennials is they're afraid of wall street
[02:50:45.600 --> 02:50:50.080]  And because because they saw what happened to their parents, you know their parents for.com. Yeah, absolutely
[02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:53.280]  They saw their fortune, you know the parents 2008. That's right and 2008
[02:50:53.520 --> 02:50:58.480]  So what's happening right now is they're very leery, but they also understand though that they have to do something for their future
[02:50:58.480 --> 02:51:00.960]  What I what I love about this model though is that?
[02:51:01.600 --> 02:51:06.080]  You know who has six to seven figures to go risk in a traditional franchise
[02:51:06.400 --> 02:51:12.560]  Franchise has been around since the 1950s. It takes six. I can't go. I couldn't go invest in a in a p. Perry's
[02:51:13.280 --> 02:51:18.320]  Hamburger place. I don't have the money that's like five million dollars. Yeah, so so what's great about this model though
[02:51:18.320 --> 02:51:23.200]  Is it gives the average person a shot and that's why I think it's such a emerging and fast-growing, you know
[02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:28.320]  Yeah, industry. Let's say skin cream your guys. That's the thing. I looked at the products
[02:51:28.320 --> 02:51:31.200]  I already heard the buzz before I ever heard from you guys. Yeah, George Dorey's involved
[02:51:31.200 --> 02:51:35.760]  He's like telling me years ago Janice like I've heard of that my mom has it my my girlfriend on my wife
[02:51:36.320 --> 02:51:39.360]  I already had the buzz and that's then I looked at the products
[02:51:39.520 --> 02:51:44.240]  Yeah, so the thing about the products which what's great about it though is even if the economy slows
[02:51:44.240 --> 02:51:46.480]  I've never met a person that says I'm not going to take care of myself
[02:51:47.120 --> 02:51:51.680]  Right. I mean nobody nobody's going to say hey, you know, there's another wrinkle. Hey, there's more gray hairs
[02:51:51.680 --> 02:51:55.840]  We're in a recession, so I'm not going to take care of myself. I mean these products are going to do well
[02:51:56.400 --> 02:52:01.280]  You know because people you when they're out they reorder the product and and regardless of the environment
[02:52:01.280 --> 02:52:06.720]  So as a you have a 50 percent reorder rate. No other company has that. Yeah, most of these products
[02:52:07.360 --> 02:52:11.120]  You know some some of them like the serum this this serum here
[02:52:11.600 --> 02:52:14.000]  It has it has over an 80 percent reorder rate
[02:52:14.080 --> 02:52:17.840]  So believe me when I when I George Dorey told me this two years ago and wait a minute
[02:52:17.840 --> 02:52:20.560]  I've seen this in my wife's bathroom. Yeah
[02:52:20.560 --> 02:52:21.440]  Yeah
[02:52:21.440 --> 02:52:25.600]  Like I'm over there, you know kissing on the neck and stuff and I'm like looking down at this at her counter
[02:52:25.760 --> 02:52:30.160]  Yeah, yeah, and that's and that's the key is that when when people are out they reorder the products
[02:52:30.160 --> 02:52:32.240]  But once again, if you're going to look at a business
[02:52:32.640 --> 02:52:36.080]  You've got to be you've got to have the business that will do well
[02:52:36.480 --> 02:52:42.720]  Regardless of what the environment looks like people have to remember that most successful business people out there don't have one
[02:52:43.440 --> 02:52:47.040]  Revenue stream they have you know, they have multiple revenue streams
[02:52:47.040 --> 02:52:51.760]  So this could be a way and the way you sell this is to other Trump supporters people that want the economy to grow
[02:52:52.080 --> 02:52:58.480]  People that are on the bandwagon of renaissance. You say hey, Alex Jones is a patriot his info is great. These are high rated
[02:52:59.840 --> 02:53:01.840]  Cosmetics and high rated supplements
[02:53:02.320 --> 02:53:07.520]  You should get this to support m4s and see how great they are and just buy it once and then they're going to be hooked
[02:53:07.520 --> 02:53:12.240]  Because it's so good now you're making money the show is making money. We're defeating the globalists
[02:53:12.480 --> 02:53:16.000]  They're getting good products and then you go. Oh become a distributor under me
[02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:20.400]  Well, think about it. How many of us right now, you know, like there's a new apple phone coming out, right?
[02:53:20.400 --> 02:53:25.120]  There's a new apple phone coming out and ever and awesome 50 bucks to make it'll be $1,400. Yeah
[02:53:25.360 --> 02:53:29.600]  Okay, so people are going to go out and say hey look at my new phone. How much are you getting paid from apple?
[02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:34.000]  You know, we we live in a society where people are constantly tell folks about the new deal
[02:53:34.640 --> 02:53:38.720]  So right now what they have going right now is if you become a a preferred customer
[02:53:38.800 --> 02:53:41.200]  You can get up to 25 off the products, right?
[02:53:41.200 --> 02:53:47.440]  You get 25 percent off of the products if you become a preferred customer if you want to get up to 40 percent off
[02:53:47.840 --> 02:53:52.960]  Then you pay a one-time membership fee, which is 49 49 95 or something like that
[02:53:53.200 --> 02:53:56.240]  And you get you can you can get all the products for up to 40 percent off
[02:53:56.240 --> 02:54:00.320]  So and that's like Costco. You save the money one time. That's right. That's right
[02:54:00.400 --> 02:54:04.320]  But what's great about this is you pay it Costco you got to pay every year, you know, you pay a member
[02:54:04.320 --> 02:54:08.080]  This is one time you pay this one time. So and then you anything with sam's, right? It's it's every year
[02:54:08.080 --> 02:54:11.680]  It's yeah, you pay it every year. So most people that are out there. They want to you know
[02:54:11.680 --> 02:54:17.680]  They want the most discount, which is 40 off of these products. I mean why again Walmart does that because they want your commitment
[02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:21.680]  They're going to give you the best deal. They want you to like put the ring on they want the commitment
[02:54:21.680 --> 02:54:27.360]  Well, I want your commitment. I want to defeat Soros and if you just my god, these are great products are the best out there
[02:54:27.760 --> 02:54:31.440]  Keep going. Yeah, so so if you look at the products for example with all of them
[02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:35.360]  Every single product on on average that you're going to be able to use here
[02:54:35.360 --> 02:54:39.520]  Some of them work right away. Like if you look at instantly ages for bags underneath the eyes
[02:54:39.840 --> 02:54:42.240]  Who in the world wants bags under the eyes male or female?
[02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:46.400]  I mean this works within a couple of minutes. I do in fact. I in fact we're going to get Alex
[02:54:46.400 --> 02:54:50.800]  I think to to do I've just been too busy. No, here's the thing. I know all this stuff works. I've tried it
[02:54:50.880 --> 02:54:53.680]  I just need to do it. Yeah, and and you see you literally see
[02:54:54.240 --> 02:54:58.480]  You literally see this work in a couple minutes when you go to info wars. Yes.com once again
[02:54:59.040 --> 02:55:00.640]  Look at the videos that are on there
[02:55:00.640 --> 02:55:05.600]  You're actually going to see the products and how fast some of these products work like for example the instantly ageless
[02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:11.200]  Two minutes you see the bags actually go away for up to six to eight hours somewhere in that ballpark
[02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:13.520]  But I mean who who wants badge, right?
[02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:17.920]  So if you look at every single product in here once again, they have purpose same thing with the energy drinks
[02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:21.600]  I mean who who has energy challenge this tell people as I've seen these for years
[02:55:21.680 --> 02:55:26.480]  Everybody's got these tell me about these it's simple. They give you energy, you know if energy challenge
[02:55:26.480 --> 02:55:32.960]  Tell folks the name of it about it. So so Nevo. There's different flavors. There's obviously, you know, I'll say great peach mango lemon ginger
[02:55:33.520 --> 02:55:36.160]  Um, I drink I drink, you know one to two a day myself
[02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:38.720]  I mean who who doesn't have energy challenges, right?
[02:55:38.880 --> 02:55:42.000]  But what I like about these is it doesn't make me feel crazy when I take them
[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:45.040]  Correct because like, you know, yeah, it does make you feel like an out-of-body experience
[02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:48.640]  Like you're taking some of these traditional energy drink my thing is if I've got to like juice
[02:55:48.960 --> 02:55:52.400]  I'll all work 18 hours and my wife is like you're so sweet, baby
[02:55:52.720 --> 02:55:54.720]  But if you show up at night at night
[02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:59.200]  You're just depressed and you you're rude and you just go sit in the chair and look at a computer
[02:55:59.600 --> 02:56:02.800]  But if I take things like this product, I'm not yeah
[02:56:02.880 --> 02:56:09.840]  Well, that's the key is that and and the thing about this product is that when you drink the product, you're going to notice that you have more energy
[02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:15.440]  I mean, you know, you have to look at the fact that we live in a society where people are sleeping less and
[02:56:15.920 --> 02:56:21.280]  And working more and stressed out. I mean, that's the truth. And so these are solutions for you
[02:56:21.280 --> 02:56:25.520]  Once again, like all the products to be able to have more energy. So and this is a worldwide problem
[02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:29.920]  What I love about Janes once again, they're in 141 countries and growing and a worldwide problem
[02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:36.640]  And it's a meta you've got medical doctors that are developing. Yeah, so that so the board of dirt the guys who actually develop these products
[02:56:36.640 --> 02:56:38.400]  These are not just you know, what they didn't want it
[02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:41.920]  What Janes didn't want to do is just get some some MDs just to say hey, we got MDs
[02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:46.080]  These are some of the most you don't have guys walking around white lab coats. No, no, no
[02:56:46.480 --> 02:56:50.480]  The guys weren't in the commercial. They were in the development, right? They were in development
[02:56:50.480 --> 02:56:55.360]  They're you know, even even, uh, you know, you you guys had Dr. Jam pop on there research this guy
[02:56:55.440 --> 02:57:01.680]  Look at look who these people are. These are some of the most elite doctors, you know, and and not just he's taking the precursors
[02:57:01.840 --> 02:57:07.520]  For your body to produce themselves. Correct. He's giving you the fuel, right? Well, it's one thing which might inject, you know
[02:57:08.640 --> 02:57:14.880]  $500 a shot growth hormone. Why not give your body the precursor to naturally do it? Right that way you don't get the cancer
[02:57:14.960 --> 02:57:19.040]  Right, exactly. Well, well the key the key is prevention the key is to do things before
[02:57:19.040 --> 02:57:22.800]  You know, if you if you give your body some good things you can help your body fight off disease
[02:57:22.800 --> 02:57:26.080]  That's what I'm saying is you take you take the steroid or whatever that kills your ass
[02:57:26.320 --> 02:57:30.960]  Why not just give your body what it needs like the like a plant like sunlight water and in the nutrients
[02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:36.080]  Yeah, I'm very very excited info wars. Yes.com banners on info wars.com
[02:57:36.400 --> 02:57:41.920]  We've got Anthony Cooney a load of her bear come up and do five more minutes with Conrad Padilla straight ahead. Stay with us
[02:57:41.920 --> 02:57:49.120]  X2 we were selling it for about three years and then they found out how big it was and I was we were buying and they said
[02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:53.280]  Oh, we want more money more money and oh, this and that and so I've broken my contract
[02:57:53.600 --> 02:57:58.320]  And right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in next to it
[02:57:58.320 --> 02:58:02.640]  That literally is so pure that if you put in a peager dish on top of 90 degree hot plate
[02:58:02.640 --> 02:58:09.440]  It gasses like I dream of genie and it's purple gas. I mean that is so pure it just goes right into your body when you take it
[02:58:09.440 --> 02:58:14.000]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it
[02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:20.240]  Ordered it six months ago. So I get the price down. I said if you don't lower it. I'm done. I'm breaking the contract
[02:58:20.240 --> 02:58:22.240]  Well, I broke the contract last week
[02:58:22.240 --> 02:58:26.080]  And so this is potentially the last run in fact right now. It is the last run
[02:58:26.320 --> 02:58:30.880]  There's viable shield x2 and we've got a good supply of it'll be gone a couple months
[02:58:31.200 --> 02:58:32.240]  x2

[03:00:20.880 --> 03:00:24.000]  I'm just trying to promote stuff that funds us and funds you and works really great
[03:00:24.560 --> 03:00:28.560]  And I don't do infomercials a lot and he didn't want to come in and do this
[03:00:28.560 --> 03:00:30.800]  He's like you're gonna put products up there. I want to talk about college and
[03:00:31.440 --> 03:00:37.040]  Alternative businesses, but yeah, no, I'm proud of this man. This helps people this empowers them and all the products that I've used
[03:00:37.040 --> 03:00:44.320]  Are great. The reviews are amazing. I mean not a quote Robert DeVallon network. This is a big, you know what hit
[03:00:45.520 --> 03:00:48.320]  Let's just say a big mammary gland hit here
[03:00:48.800 --> 03:00:54.000]  So I'm just telling you ladies and gentlemen that you want to get it on the ground floor of m4js.com
[03:00:54.480 --> 03:00:57.040]  You can go to Janice and all other sites that have it and that's great
[03:00:57.280 --> 03:01:00.720]  The big thing is go to m4js.com and get the best deals and it funds our operation
[03:01:01.360 --> 03:01:04.560]  And and quantify though you because you're talking about this new deal like
[03:01:04.560 --> 03:01:08.640]  How do people qualify to then have you guys with matching funds or yeah
[03:01:09.200 --> 03:01:14.800]  So so one of the things about this company is that they they really do get involved with helping the independent
[03:01:15.360 --> 03:01:18.400]  Distributors with you know getting getting their businesses going and things like that
[03:01:18.880 --> 03:01:24.560]  What's great about the company though is whatever help that you need in your area or whatever help that you need in that particular
[03:01:24.560 --> 03:01:29.600]  The country that you're in they're gonna they're gonna partner with you and strategize with you along of course with my team
[03:01:29.600 --> 03:01:33.520]  Oh, that's the other good news because it always kills people to get shipping from the u.s. You guys
[03:01:33.520 --> 03:01:37.920]  Cut all the shipping costs because you have offices all over when you order at m4js.com
[03:01:38.560 --> 03:01:44.560]  Yeah, you don't have those huge shipping costs. So how does that work? Yeah, so so basically what's great about it is if you're looking for a business
[03:01:44.880 --> 03:01:49.840]  Once again, the company does everything for you. They handle all the logistics all the shipping
[03:01:49.920 --> 03:01:53.440]  I mean that I'm sure you guys can appreciate that here right if all logistics are nightmare
[03:01:53.520 --> 03:01:56.560]  Yeah, I mean the company does everything for you. So you're not having to do all that
[03:01:56.880 --> 03:02:00.720]  You know if you wanted to start up a traditional company out there you got to handle almost everything on your own
[03:02:00.720 --> 03:02:04.800]  So what's great about this what about you need you need 50 million dollars to start a real
[03:02:04.880 --> 03:02:07.520]  You do you do you do I mean what's great about me? We did it
[03:02:07.760 --> 03:02:12.080]  I mean, you know all these products like you were talking about I mean look look how good that they look
[03:02:12.160 --> 03:02:15.360]  Yes, there's a lot of engineering and everything else, but all I care about how they work
[03:02:15.440 --> 03:02:20.240]  They they work, but they look great too and great what's great about it is genesis. They sell themselves
[03:02:20.560 --> 03:02:23.920]  Genes pay for all that we didn't even have they you know nobody was calling us to say hey
[03:02:24.240 --> 03:02:27.440]  You know this is going to cost this amount of money for us to engineer this they handle all that
[03:02:27.440 --> 03:02:31.600]  No, I get it if I'm going to sell somebody's book or film I go listen. I need your film for 30%
[03:02:32.160 --> 03:02:37.200]  Yeah, because I can't sell my product and I've got all this infrastructure and all the attacks I'm under
[03:02:38.160 --> 03:02:41.280]  I and they go but I need 50% and I go
[03:02:41.840 --> 03:02:43.680]  Do you have any infrastructure?
[03:02:43.680 --> 03:02:48.240]  Yeah, this is pure profit and then most people they're just too dumb. Yeah, they just did it
[03:02:48.320 --> 03:02:52.240]  I'm like, okay. I can't sell your product in because I mean you understand. I will go bankrupt. Yeah
[03:02:52.240 --> 03:02:58.080]  Yeah, Lord Soros is suing me. Yeah, well, you know going into going into the business part too. Just one other thing too is
[03:02:58.560 --> 03:03:02.320]  You know according to Dave Ramsey 70 78%
[03:03:02.800 --> 03:03:05.600]  70% of americans live paycheck to paycheck
[03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:08.160]  So I would say to most people that are out there today
[03:03:08.480 --> 03:03:12.240]  How do you feel about that because you know one of the things we because they look for one job?
[03:03:12.480 --> 03:03:15.280]  And I'm going to do a few more minutes after this than our than our other hosts coming up
[03:03:15.600 --> 03:03:20.720]  It's people you're right everyone that I ever grew up with my family were farmers and ranchers
[03:03:20.720 --> 03:03:24.320]  They had pigs. They had chickens. They had cows. Sometimes the grass didn't grow good
[03:03:24.400 --> 03:03:29.200]  So they had to sell cows the pigs made them survive or it was eggs or they had moonshine stills running
[03:03:29.280 --> 03:03:31.360]  And you know and did murder for hire on the side. I'm joking
[03:03:31.600 --> 03:03:36.560]  The point is is that you've got to have a lot of different jobs to take care of things
[03:03:36.640 --> 03:03:40.560]  You do you do and that's and the but the thing is alex if you're going to start a business
[03:03:40.880 --> 03:03:43.600]  You know if you're going to if you're going to start something like this for example
[03:03:44.080 --> 03:03:48.480]  One of the cool things genus has is they have what's called an ambassador pack. Okay. It's about a thousand bucks
[03:03:48.480 --> 03:03:50.480]  Okay, it's an ambassador pack
[03:03:50.720 --> 03:03:54.000]  Where are you you get a ton of product? You get all the marketing you get your website
[03:03:54.080 --> 03:03:57.200]  Where are you going to go start your own home-based business for a grand?
[03:03:58.080 --> 03:04:02.080]  Ruler no the infrastructure is there. It's kick-ass products
[03:04:02.400 --> 03:04:09.200]  All I bring you is win win win win win win win win win because I will not metaphysically bring you to something
[03:04:09.200 --> 03:04:14.880]  That's a bad deal. This is info wars. Yes.com is the next level and
[03:04:14.880 --> 03:04:18.720]  People's are just try the genus
[03:04:19.760 --> 03:04:24.240]  Mind they should try the antioxidant. They should try the skin cream. They should try the energy drinks
[03:04:24.480 --> 03:04:29.840]  They should do it and support m4 store.com and our products as well. It's just that it's good with them trying to shut us down
[03:04:30.480 --> 03:04:34.320]  Uh, you know, they're openly saying shut my shopping carts down trying to take my banking away
[03:04:34.560 --> 03:04:36.560]  They want to bankrupt us because we're bringing america back
[03:04:36.880 --> 03:04:41.360]  We're gonna come back and finish up with you my friend and throw the baton to anthony kumi of compound media dot com
[03:04:41.360 --> 03:04:48.480]  In t-minus 60 seconds straight ahead. Have you spread the info wars.com link today? Have you told folks about the local station? Please do
[03:04:54.160 --> 03:04:57.600]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is
[03:04:58.080 --> 03:05:00.960]  The real drama can be found here in leilani estates
[03:05:01.360 --> 03:05:07.120]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[03:05:07.680 --> 03:05:10.560]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[03:05:10.560 --> 03:05:15.760]  And acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out
[03:05:15.840 --> 03:05:18.880]  We employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[03:05:19.440 --> 03:05:26.480]  Alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater
[03:05:27.200 --> 03:05:30.560]  Next we tested the water from our elixapure gravity filter
[03:05:31.040 --> 03:05:34.160]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[03:05:34.560 --> 03:05:37.760]  But the pH was also restored to optimal levels
[03:05:37.760 --> 03:05:42.960]  As it turns out the filter on the elixapure raises the pH of the water
[03:05:43.520 --> 03:05:48.560]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[03:05:49.120 --> 03:05:53.280]  But more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[03:05:59.280 --> 03:06:03.520]  We are on the march the empire is on the run
[03:06:03.520 --> 03:06:08.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[03:06:33.520 --> 03:06:35.840]  Spades, the ace of spades
[03:06:39.760 --> 03:06:46.560]  Playing for the high ground dancing to the devil going with the flow it's all a game to me
[03:06:53.360 --> 03:06:56.800]  Seven on eleven snake-horns watching you
[03:06:56.800 --> 03:07:05.280]  Double up on Chris, double snake-horns playing, the ace of spades
[03:07:05.280 --> 03:07:06.640]  The ace of spades
[03:07:06.640 --> 03:07:09.680]  All right Conrad Padilla is our guest
[03:07:10.160 --> 03:07:14.000]  We're talking about funding ourselves here with one of the number one
[03:07:15.120 --> 03:07:19.680]  Companies out there, and I'm very very excited if you want to just go buy the products that great
[03:07:19.680 --> 03:07:24.320]  If you want to be a distributor and really kick ass, that's great. It sells itself in full wars
[03:07:24.320 --> 03:07:31.040]  Yes.com in closing. I'm very proud of the work you've done. I've had hundreds and hundreds of offers
[03:07:31.920 --> 03:07:35.760]  To do MOM. I only did one other company. It went from like 12 million a year to
[03:07:36.560 --> 03:07:38.560]  80 million a year in three years
[03:07:38.560 --> 03:07:42.160]  And unfortunately we didn't make the money to fund ourselves, but it's good products and
[03:07:43.120 --> 03:07:48.080]  But but you guys is next level so I commend you and I'm very very proud of the work you're doing
[03:07:48.080 --> 03:07:50.960]  And we're just very very thankful and I think people are crazy
[03:07:50.960 --> 03:07:54.480]  If they don't become distributors for this
[03:07:55.200 --> 03:07:57.200]  Try the products first in fours. Yes.com
[03:07:57.520 --> 03:08:03.120]  Then then then become a distributor and sell your family your neighbors on it and then you know
[03:08:03.120 --> 03:08:05.840]  You get like 10 customers. It'll pay for your monthly supply
[03:08:06.560 --> 03:08:12.640]  But hey go really crazy open a storefront because I mean I was I was reading like you guys are already number one
[03:08:12.640 --> 03:08:16.960]  In like more than a dozen countries or number five worldwide. You haven't really pushed in the us yet
[03:08:16.960 --> 03:08:21.200]  But again quantify why they didn't start in the us yet a multi-billion dollar company
[03:08:21.600 --> 03:08:24.480]  Well, the key the key is they wanted to see if the company can make it first
[03:08:24.480 --> 03:08:28.080]  So that's why they started in Asia. This is the biggest direct selling network marketing
[03:08:28.640 --> 03:08:32.000]  Uh country in the world and so what I would say, you know give credit to alex
[03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:34.240]  I'm really glad that I could be here today, but credit alex
[03:08:34.240 --> 03:08:38.000]  He's listen this guy's a really good business guy and I'm going to tell you guys this
[03:08:38.480 --> 03:08:43.200]  If you're seeing him get involved in something you really really should probably do the same thing
[03:08:43.200 --> 03:08:46.960]  So I think it's I think it's really really important for you guys to understand that
[03:08:47.440 --> 03:08:51.840]  You know you guys have the opportunity right now for to actually help us expand the market
[03:08:51.840 --> 03:08:55.360]  Oh, I want to give our listeners a ground floor and the product so good
[03:08:55.360 --> 03:09:00.160]  It just I think it goes on forever unless an asteroid. It's the earth. Yeah, you know, the company's so good
[03:09:00.320 --> 03:09:05.200]  I mean, I that I'm just saying I want listeners like they've done to just come to me and say thank god
[03:09:05.200 --> 03:09:08.800]  You got me involved in that. Yeah, well that told me to buy gold. It was 300 an ounce
[03:09:08.800 --> 03:09:13.840]  You told me to get out at 2,000 and then I sold it all and I made 20 million dollars and you were right
[03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:18.240]  And I'm like, yes, I said get out of gold at the top. I didn't keep selling it to you
[03:09:18.320 --> 03:09:23.280]  I said get out of it. Yeah, I had sponsors threaten to sue me. They're like, you're gonna keep pitching gold and I said
[03:09:24.160 --> 03:09:26.160]  Jump up a cliff
[03:09:26.320 --> 03:09:27.360]  We'll take it
[03:09:27.360 --> 03:09:29.520]  So that's how this works like I'm gonna
[03:09:30.320 --> 03:09:34.160]  Look, I sometimes I'm wrong rarely. I'm going to tell you what the hit is
[03:09:34.160 --> 03:09:40.000]  Again, like Robert DeVall says, I got a number one show. It's a big, you know, one hit. Oh my god
[03:09:40.160 --> 03:09:43.280]  I mean, I want big juicy hits. Yeah, that's what I want
[03:09:43.440 --> 03:09:45.440]  We'll take about it like this if Alex is right
[03:09:45.840 --> 03:09:50.160]  This could potentially be huge for you if it's wrong your life's the same. So what do you have to lose?
[03:09:50.560 --> 03:09:56.240]  Well, you've got great products m4s. Yes.com and people can go there and there's so many great deals there
[03:09:56.240 --> 03:09:57.760]  I mean distributor is so many excited
[03:09:57.760 --> 03:10:01.600]  So how do people get qualified where you guys didn't have matching funds? No one's ever done that in mlm
[03:10:01.600 --> 03:10:05.680]  Because I don't call you in my life because it's all about the product. But yeah, how are how are you able to do something?
[03:10:05.680 --> 03:10:08.960]  No, I guess you're just so profitable. Yeah. Well, well the company once again
[03:10:08.960 --> 03:10:13.840]  The company is run by some very very successful people randy and wendy louis and I was just telling you right now that
[03:10:14.400 --> 03:10:19.600]  They run this like a like a fortune 500 company. It's not, you know, it's run very very well. So there's like bezos
[03:10:19.600 --> 03:10:22.480]  He's putting everything back in. Yeah, they put a lot of money back in the company
[03:10:22.480 --> 03:10:28.400]  But they also have money available to help people with you know, getting their business to the next level and all sorts of different things
[03:10:28.400 --> 03:10:33.280]  So the company is just very very well run because the one mlm was involved. They're great guys. They're good products
[03:10:33.280 --> 03:10:36.000]  But there was like no help. Yeah, it's like oh the product's good
[03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:38.240]  But like I'm out here like that's what I like about you now
[03:10:38.320 --> 03:10:43.760]  Yeah, well going back to once again if you get the ambassador package you have all the marketing materials the websites
[03:10:44.080 --> 03:10:48.080]  You know the company handles everything for you to start your own your own home-based business
[03:10:48.080 --> 03:10:49.440]  I mean, that's the bottom line
[03:10:49.440 --> 03:10:52.720]  You know, you don't have to go figure this out and you know, there, you know, Robert Kisaki
[03:10:52.720 --> 03:10:55.200]  He wrote rich dead poor dad number one selling financial book of all time
[03:10:55.200 --> 03:11:00.560]  He says the number one reason why I like the the profession of network marketing is because it has
[03:11:00.960 --> 03:11:04.880]  You can't find a better profession for personal development. It's who you become along the way
[03:11:04.960 --> 03:11:09.760]  It teaches you to be a salesperson, but you've got to have a good product. You do. I mean if you're selling
[03:11:10.880 --> 03:11:14.560]  You know dog turds. It's not gonna be a very good business. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you do
[03:11:14.560 --> 03:11:19.360]  You have to have solid products, but you also have to have you also have to have a solid model
[03:11:19.920 --> 03:11:22.960]  But the but the key to is it's all there. All right is there
[03:11:22.960 --> 03:11:25.840]  All right Conrad Padilla. Great job in fours. Yes.com
[03:11:26.240 --> 03:11:29.920]  We're about to go to break in a few minutes. Stay right there. I want to introduce Anthony Cume
[03:11:29.920 --> 03:11:34.240]  I've just stolen 10 minutes from and I apologize compound media.com. He was on
[03:11:35.280 --> 03:11:36.880]  Last Thursday
[03:11:36.880 --> 03:11:40.160]  Right before I got banned on Twitter. It's how about he banned on Twitter and Facebook
[03:11:40.800 --> 03:11:45.520]  And then they said I bullied the jerk who brags at CNN and he got me banned everywhere
[03:11:46.240 --> 03:11:49.840]  And so this guy's had the number one show on terrestrial radio. He's been number one on XM
[03:11:49.840 --> 03:11:53.360]  What happens when you're number one? I mean he was number one because I get the ratings
[03:11:53.360 --> 03:11:55.680]  He was number one in the markets. He was in on terrestrial radio
[03:11:55.680 --> 03:12:01.840]  So he said poo poo wrong the FCC went after him because he was a comic who was more libertarian conservative
[03:12:02.240 --> 03:12:04.240]  You you could be a leftist you could stay on air
[03:12:04.960 --> 03:12:09.120]  And so then he just said they're gonna get everybody. Well, they got me that same day
[03:12:09.120 --> 03:12:12.560]  They'd already purged me but then they purged me then then our app that was number one
[03:12:13.360 --> 03:12:18.560]  On apple and android it's still on android in fours.com four slash app. They blocked that
[03:12:18.560 --> 03:12:20.560]  That was number one
[03:12:20.560 --> 03:12:23.760]  So they can't let us be winners. So you think when you're number one
[03:12:24.720 --> 03:12:28.560]  You then are number one. No, no in the real world when you get the pole position
[03:12:29.040 --> 03:12:31.040]  They don't give you champagne the hot blonde
[03:12:31.280 --> 03:12:36.880]  They take the champagne and crack it over your head. And so anthony cumming. We're at this point. What do you got coming up today?
[03:12:37.760 --> 03:12:45.200]  Oh my god, first of all, uh, you're absolutely right if you're if you're inconsequential and no one's listening to you
[03:12:45.200 --> 03:12:48.640]  They won't care, you know, they'll they might leave you alone
[03:12:48.800 --> 03:12:55.360]  Maybe not but if you're the likes of alex jones and you're saying things that are affecting their agenda
[03:12:56.400 --> 03:13:03.440]  My god, they want you gone and and it's bizarre to think there's anyone out there that doesn't see this
[03:13:03.680 --> 03:13:09.280]  That doesn't see it's obviously happening. I love how they were calling you a conspiracy theorist. It's like
[03:13:09.280 --> 03:13:15.600]  What's the conspiracy theory in that alex was saying they're going to take me off of social media?
[03:13:15.840 --> 03:13:20.800]  And then they did and then they're calling you this theorist. No, it is a conspiracy
[03:13:21.040 --> 03:13:28.800]  It's a legitimate conspiracy to silence the voices of conservative talk show hosts because it doesn't suit their agenda
[03:13:29.040 --> 03:13:37.120]  Especially during such an important time as the midterm elections and of course the entire term of our president trump
[03:13:37.120 --> 03:13:43.360]  It's bizarre alex and we know for years. They've been censoring us anybody that's successful these executives
[03:13:43.440 --> 03:13:47.120]  I never talked to you. I know it happens. It happened to me. They're always some jerk off
[03:13:47.200 --> 03:13:50.880]  It's a sellout. They make less money than you they call you in the office thing
[03:13:50.960 --> 03:13:54.800]  Oh, we want a new direction for your show. Are you going to be off? I had one guy
[03:13:55.360 --> 03:13:58.880]  Slap me and I grabbed by the arm and I said dude, I'll beat your ass. They fire me
[03:13:59.360 --> 03:14:03.120]  And he had security come and I said, listen you son of a bitch. You don't slap me
[03:14:03.120 --> 03:14:06.880]  It's not like I'm some big tough guy, but who does this asshole think he is?
[03:14:06.960 --> 03:14:11.600]  I was making that radio station millions of dollars and they fired me because I wouldn't
[03:14:12.160 --> 03:14:17.040]  Metaphysically suck the ding dong. Excuse my friendship that little piece of crap
[03:14:17.280 --> 03:14:22.080]  And these corporations are run by these mental midgets that want real men to bow down to them, anthony
[03:14:22.160 --> 03:14:27.120]  And you've had this I never talked to you about this, but let me guess have you had to be in the office with the corporate jerk off
[03:14:27.120 --> 03:14:35.360]  Oh, so many times from from the pinnacle of the the corporate power like uh, uh at cbs
[03:14:35.760 --> 03:14:37.760]  Les Moonves was my boss
[03:14:38.080 --> 03:14:43.760]  And he was he uh, I got a lot of shooting cops in the back of the head is wrong. You're fired
[03:14:44.720 --> 03:14:51.360]  Yeah, it got to that point and then the lowly program directors and general managers that uh, that tell you
[03:14:51.360 --> 03:14:58.480]  You're a successful guy of people that know you ladies man holding yarns to have these nobodies who just want to mess with an alpha male
[03:14:58.720 --> 03:15:04.400]  Like they're pissed. You're number one people think you're number one. No, no, no being number one. It's not fun folks. It's not fun
[03:15:05.040 --> 03:15:12.080]  They failed they failed that on air. So what they want to do is tell you now how to do
[03:15:12.720 --> 03:15:17.360]  Uh broadcast radio and I've never taken their word. I've never listened to them
[03:15:17.360 --> 03:15:21.200]  Uh, we've we've always gone against it and always been very successful
[03:15:21.360 --> 03:15:27.040]  And now they want to just shut us completely off everywhere completely completely. That would say build your own thing
[03:15:27.120 --> 03:15:30.240]  Oh, now they want our websites now. They want a credit card processing

[03:20:02.960 --> 03:20:19.760]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones
[03:20:33.520 --> 03:20:45.120]  So I had this walked out interview a couple nights ago at the fermant hotel
[03:20:45.360 --> 03:20:49.840]  I guess two nights ago with patrick bet david this big billionaire insurance company owner
[03:20:50.080 --> 03:20:52.080]  He's got a viral youtube channel
[03:20:52.400 --> 03:20:55.680]  You know their average video has five million views. So he wanted to and even this army
[03:20:55.680 --> 03:21:03.680]  There's all these Armenian dudes in this hotel interviewing me and I'm like in a spy novel
[03:21:04.240 --> 03:21:06.240]  And I and I've
[03:21:06.880 --> 03:21:08.880]  I'm gonna get a whole story. It just gets weirder from there
[03:21:09.440 --> 03:21:14.080]  Uh, but the interview is up there and it's pretty good. You see my big fat belly hanging on
[03:21:14.560 --> 03:21:18.960]  Uh, but it's uh, it's pretty fun and we're and we're up there drinking whiskey too
[03:21:19.040 --> 03:21:23.840]  I think he was trying to get me drunk and then I think he actually got more drunk than I did because I was actually just drinking
[03:21:23.840 --> 03:21:25.840]  You know coca-cola. I'm joking
[03:21:26.480 --> 03:21:27.440]  but
[03:21:27.440 --> 03:21:29.200]  getting serious
[03:21:29.200 --> 03:21:35.200]  And and and getting back to anthony kumya anthony kumya again has been number one on threshold radio number one on xm
[03:21:35.760 --> 03:21:42.160]  And I keep saying that because if you're number one, but you don't do what they want they try to shut you down like take pootie pie
[03:21:43.360 --> 03:21:47.840]  If you're not 15 years older younger, you're like, who is that? Let me tell you
[03:21:48.720 --> 03:21:50.720]  pootie pie has talked about me
[03:21:50.720 --> 03:21:58.320]  Maybe 10 times the last few years most of it the last month. I literally go to the shopping mall the grocery store
[03:21:59.520 --> 03:22:07.280]  Children begin acting like I'm Elvis Presley. Okay in 1957. I mean, you know, it is it is it is everything
[03:22:07.280 --> 03:22:12.640]  But young girl stung her panties at me because I but he has 22 billion views on youtube
[03:22:13.360 --> 03:22:17.520]  22 billion views. He has 65 million subscribers. That's only one thing he does
[03:22:17.520 --> 03:22:23.840]  They came to him two years ago and said we're going to shut you down even though he's not political unless you go under our control
[03:22:24.480 --> 03:22:27.520]  Nobody's got that many views, but that's what I'm saying. They want
[03:22:28.320 --> 03:22:30.320]  control of what's popular
[03:22:30.320 --> 03:22:34.880]  These are vampires and so they're trying to shut me down. I want kumya to take over do his own show
[03:22:34.880 --> 03:22:37.280]  We're honored to have him here with compound media dot com, but
[03:22:38.400 --> 03:22:41.120]  I want to believe this tries and effects going to backfire on them
[03:22:41.680 --> 03:22:46.880]  And yes, we have a larger hardcore audience than ever, but you look at the track. It's not like spikes now
[03:22:46.880 --> 03:22:52.720]  It's this big not flat line. It's kind of going up, but it's this new only the hardcore listening
[03:22:53.200 --> 03:22:58.560]  And it's this digital no man's land and they call it a global social score and
[03:22:59.360 --> 03:23:01.920]  I've been on the phone the White House and the Pentagon and
[03:23:02.800 --> 03:23:05.920]  Fox news contributors. I'm going read this document
[03:23:06.560 --> 03:23:10.960]  Google is working with the Chinese. They believe it's a takeover and they're finally getting it
[03:23:10.960 --> 03:23:16.880]  But I don't want it to be too late 54 days out from the election. Anthony. I mean, we cannot underestimate
[03:23:17.360 --> 03:23:23.760]  This takeover is so un-American so dangerous. So crazy. So on one hand. Yeah, people want freedom
[03:23:23.760 --> 03:23:25.440]  It shows America isn't dumb
[03:23:25.440 --> 03:23:30.080]  But on the other hand they are coming down on us. So I don't want to sit here and say, oh, it's tries and effect
[03:23:30.320 --> 03:23:32.320]  It blew up in their face. No
[03:23:32.400 --> 03:23:35.280]  You'd probably much rather be on 200 radio stations to be number one
[03:23:35.280 --> 03:23:39.680]  You'd probably much rather be number one on xm. You had to do it yourself and now they want to take that away
[03:23:39.680 --> 03:23:41.680]  Now they're taking
[03:23:41.680 --> 03:23:46.000]  Pro whether you hate Israel or love Israel. They're taking pro-Israel groups
[03:23:48.240 --> 03:23:52.880]  Visa away, I mean they're they're they're they're trying to take my my my payment services away
[03:23:52.880 --> 03:23:57.360]  I mean we it's not like we're 10 steps from tyranny. We're walking in the door
[03:23:59.040 --> 03:24:06.160]  When you hear people say well do it yourself and we have to the extent that we can as far as we've gone
[03:24:06.160 --> 03:24:10.160]  With info wars and myself with compound media and a few other places
[03:24:11.040 --> 03:24:12.640]  On online
[03:24:12.640 --> 03:24:19.120]  We can't get on a telephone poles and start stringing fiber optic cable to get our own infrastructure
[03:24:19.440 --> 03:24:26.160]  And there will always be someone over your head that holds the power to shut you down
[03:24:26.480 --> 03:24:30.560]  And if they don't like what you're saying, it's like jumping in on people in a phone conversation
[03:24:30.560 --> 03:24:33.760]  That's the perfect analogy. They're literally trying to kick us off the backbone
[03:24:33.760 --> 03:24:40.400]  Yeah, and and look, I am the last person that would clamor for any type of regulation
[03:24:41.120 --> 03:24:46.880]  Uh, I'm a libertarian for the most part and I I don't like the idea of that
[03:24:47.040 --> 03:24:52.800]  But when you have a company that like google that is responsible for way over 90 percent
[03:24:53.280 --> 03:24:58.400]  Of the the search results and they're dictating what people see on that front page
[03:24:58.400 --> 03:25:03.360]  When you google search something and only five percent of the people ever hit the next page
[03:25:03.920 --> 03:25:09.920]  It's literally they are putting if you put Alex Jones in is force-fed liberal garbage
[03:25:10.640 --> 03:25:16.960]  insane if you put in alex jones on uh google or anthony coombs it's a negative crap just garbage
[03:25:17.360 --> 03:25:24.640]  Yes, and and because that's what they want the people to see the same thing they say you you want trannies
[03:25:24.640 --> 03:25:32.000]  And then now I guess it's I'm out. I want trannies now because I'm like surfing online and some adult friend finder thing pops up
[03:25:32.080 --> 03:25:38.160]  And they go to a menu. I went to the menu was a porn menu of everything you could imagine blacks on blondes gay guys
[03:25:38.400 --> 03:25:43.840]  And they go, oh look on this page. We found a tranny. I'm not against trannies, but the point is it's the same crap
[03:25:44.240 --> 03:25:49.120]  Why did they why do they come up with the same weird stuff? Like what what is this of tranny obsession?
[03:25:49.120 --> 03:25:57.440]  Well, I have no idea. Yeah, it's been pinned on so many people and the the the most ridiculous part of what I believe is
[03:25:58.000 --> 03:25:59.840]  Their whole take
[03:25:59.840 --> 03:26:05.920]  Is that we should be inclusive and accepting of people of different genders and whatnot
[03:26:06.240 --> 03:26:12.560]  And then when they want to try to nail you they say that you have uh this affinity for uh,
[03:26:12.560 --> 03:26:19.760]  Certain sexualities that you're supposed to as they say be tolerant towards so I don't really get there
[03:26:19.840 --> 03:26:26.240]  They're playing on this whole thing. It's so the weirdness of the globalist. I can't figure it out sometimes. It's like it's crazy
[03:26:27.120 --> 03:26:32.160]  It is insanity and they will they know what sticks. They know what makes a noise
[03:26:32.320 --> 03:26:41.280]  That's why we've just seen this coming out about a cavanaugh with diane feinstein that says, uh, there's a me too problem in his past
[03:26:41.280 --> 03:26:48.880]  Uh-oh, we ought to we ought to postpone the vote until uh the fbi if some woman claims he ever
[03:26:49.600 --> 03:26:52.960]  Asked her out. It's so it's like the the pubic hair on the coke
[03:26:54.320 --> 03:26:58.960]  It's it's same thing. They know what is going to get them coverage
[03:26:59.280 --> 03:27:03.600]  And what they know what that dog whistle is going to be that's going to get people's ears up
[03:27:03.840 --> 03:27:10.400]  They're talking about something from 1983. Oh, I love how jim jordan exposes all their corruption
[03:27:10.400 --> 03:27:15.280]  And so they go 30 years ago at a school. There was a rumor that somebody
[03:27:15.760 --> 03:27:20.880]  Head on a kid. They don't even say it's like. Oh my god jim jordan and now look at that think progress headline
[03:27:20.880 --> 03:27:22.880]  I'm glad you mentioned that it's like
[03:27:23.760 --> 03:27:28.640]  Brett cavanaugh has a mysterious hashtag me too problem and federal investigators are involved and there's no proof
[03:27:28.640 --> 03:27:30.400]  They just say you know
[03:27:30.400 --> 03:27:33.920]  Someone claims jones was caught having sex with martians in his basement
[03:27:33.920 --> 03:27:39.760]  There's no proof of it and look something's got to be done about this
[03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:45.040]  You can't just anonymously and and without any kind of backup
[03:27:45.920 --> 03:27:47.920]  sources
[03:27:49.520 --> 03:27:51.440]  I got the force four years ago
[03:27:51.440 --> 03:27:54.880]  And I dated a bunch of chicks and one of these chicks called up and said you better give me money
[03:27:54.960 --> 03:27:58.000]  I'm gonna say something you know when I said I'm going to the fbi right now
[03:27:58.000 --> 03:28:01.520]  I got in the car and drove the fbi. She shut her mouth up real quick
[03:28:01.520 --> 03:28:05.680]  I've never pushed anything on anybody. That's what I mean though. They just think I'm gonna take this
[03:28:05.760 --> 03:28:07.680]  I'm not taking it anymore, man
[03:28:07.680 --> 03:28:14.560]  No, and and more people have to do that. We can't keep apologizing for things that never happened or might have happened
[03:28:14.800 --> 03:28:20.480]  I see no the woman's jumping on top of you at a bar and then you take her to the hotel room
[03:28:20.560 --> 03:28:23.360]  You haven't done anything. I'm not gonna sit there and put up with this
[03:28:24.560 --> 03:28:25.440]  Yeah
[03:28:25.440 --> 03:28:28.480]  What do you got coming up because I don't want to dominate this whole thing when I'm having fun talking to

[03:28:41.200 --> 03:28:41.920]  tidbits

[03:30:53.920 --> 03:30:55.440]  x2
[03:30:55.440 --> 03:30:57.440]  We were selling it for about three years
[03:30:57.440 --> 03:31:02.000]  And then they found out how big it was and I was we were buying and they said oh we want more money more money
[03:31:02.080 --> 03:31:06.800]  And oh this and that and so I've broken my contract and right now we can't get more of this
[03:31:06.800 --> 03:31:13.280]  Proprietary ingredient that goes in next to it. It literally is so pure that if you put in a picker dish on top of 90 degree

[03:31:26.320 --> 03:31:28.000]  Ordered it six months ago
[03:31:28.000 --> 03:31:31.760]  So I get the price down and I said if you don't lower it. I'm done. I'm breaking the contract
[03:31:31.920 --> 03:31:33.920]  Well, I broke the contract last week
[03:31:33.920 --> 03:31:36.880]  And so this is potentially the last run in fact right now
[03:31:36.960 --> 03:31:39.280]  It is the last run of survival shield x2
[03:31:39.920 --> 03:31:43.360]  And we've we've got a good supply of it'll be gone a couple months x2

[03:31:55.040 --> 03:32:00.000]  The whole thing was for me leg first demonize info wars lie about us build a straw man
[03:32:00.000 --> 03:32:05.440]  Then sue us to add credibility to that then have a few fake strikes on youtube and facebook
[03:32:05.600 --> 03:32:09.440]  With nebulous terms like bullying children and islamophobia
[03:32:09.680 --> 03:32:16.160]  And then wallah two weeks later ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms
[03:32:16.400 --> 03:32:22.080]  Where we were all in the top five or top 10 news feeds go to info wars.com

[03:32:53.280 --> 03:33:21.280]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:23.280 --> 03:33:25.280]  You

[03:34:11.600 --> 03:34:15.920]  So host the compound media will host that oh and shawyer's gonna host the day before that day but not the next day
[03:34:16.960 --> 03:34:19.120]  i'm gonna get out of here and let him take over because well, you know
[03:34:19.120 --> 03:34:22.480]  I have him host if if i'm just gonna take over but two little plugs like i said
[03:34:22.480 --> 03:34:29.600]  This interview alex jones i'm ready to die exclusive interview after being banned boy. That's a cool headline
[03:34:30.400 --> 03:34:38.400]  But it's true. So there you go. No surrender globalist. No surrender death before dishonor
[03:34:40.720 --> 03:34:48.800]  So the whole point is is that uh, we're gonna tweet that out. I'm on twitter. Sorry you have to tweet us out
[03:34:48.800 --> 03:34:57.600]  But info wars.com news wars.com prisonplanet.tv support us. We're we're nowhere without you and then separately, you know, here's the deal
[03:34:58.880 --> 03:35:00.320]  I studied
[03:35:00.320 --> 03:35:01.840]  Going back like
[03:35:01.840 --> 03:35:06.160]  20 years ago with top medical doctors scientists. Why are they putting bromide fluoride?
[03:35:06.720 --> 03:35:10.960]  Fluorine the water when they've got other stuff to kill bacteria and why are they doing fluoride?
[03:35:11.120 --> 03:35:14.720]  It's like drinking sunscreen claiming you don't want to get skin cancer
[03:35:14.720 --> 03:35:19.600]  Why are you drinking fluoride for your teeth? You put it on topically and it's not the good fluoride calcium fluoride
[03:35:19.600 --> 03:35:24.400]  It's the hydrofluorosalic acid, which is actually a weaponized fluoride. It'll eat through concrete or steel
[03:35:24.960 --> 03:35:26.480]  Like alien blood
[03:35:26.480 --> 03:35:32.000]  So the good alien blood is survival shield x2 now the jerk offs
[03:35:32.560 --> 03:35:36.400]  In the corporate world know that we have a da license through a top manufacturer
[03:35:37.200 --> 03:35:40.880]  In a state. I won't mention to have this this this is this is unbelievable
[03:35:40.880 --> 03:35:46.720]  They they jacked with it and so they increased prices. They did a bunch of stuff. So I said
[03:35:47.360 --> 03:35:49.360]  No more and I broke my contract
[03:35:49.760 --> 03:35:54.320]  And this is the last run of x2 now. We may get a new one. That's going to take six months to a year
[03:35:54.960 --> 03:36:01.280]  Conservatively, so if you want your x2 with 98 reviews one six thousand one hundred twenty six reviews power reviews
[03:36:01.520 --> 03:36:04.560]  If you want to find out what the good halogen is versus the bad halogen
[03:36:05.360 --> 03:36:09.360]  info wars.com info wars.live.com or triple a two five three three one three nine
[03:36:09.360 --> 03:36:14.240]  And uh get a t-shirt get a book whatever. Let me tell you you want to piss sort of soft
[03:36:14.240 --> 03:36:16.240]  They hit me with everything they got they had
[03:36:16.880 --> 03:36:20.320]  history channel shows discovery channel shows comedy shows
[03:36:20.880 --> 03:36:23.280]  HBO shows showtime shows homeland
[03:36:23.840 --> 03:36:30.800]  Going I'm Alex Jones and I love the Nazis and then it and I didn't say that
[03:36:31.760 --> 03:36:33.360]  Why'd they do that?
[03:36:33.360 --> 03:36:36.160]  Because they wanted to set me up as the first domino
[03:36:36.160 --> 03:36:39.440]  To bring the whole thing down and now they're doing it
[03:36:40.320 --> 03:36:42.880]  So it's one hell of a fight. It's crazy town
[03:36:43.440 --> 03:36:45.600]  And you're because we need our own voice
[03:36:46.480 --> 03:36:49.840]  They want to silence me so they can then say that you know
[03:36:50.000 --> 03:36:57.120]  I'm having gay orgies with trannies and I'm I'm in a kkk and I love hitler and I raped an eastern bunny last night
[03:36:58.080 --> 03:37:03.600]  So that I can't respond to that. But the good news is we're still here and you're spreading the word right now. They're losing
[03:37:03.600 --> 03:37:05.600]  So they're really don't know what to do
[03:37:06.160 --> 03:37:11.840]  Uh, they meant bust a cap in my ass. Whatever Anthony kill me compound media.com is taking over but whatever you do
[03:37:12.320 --> 03:37:14.320]  X2 the final run in four store.com
[03:37:15.120 --> 03:37:20.000]  Funding us gets you great products and really sticks. You know what in the eye of the globalist
[03:37:20.000 --> 03:37:24.320]  So thank you Anthony. Look forward to you next thursday hosting the main transmission my friend

[03:37:57.120 --> 03:38:01.040]  We love compound media brother. We're all in this together and that's the thing these betas and these globalists
[03:38:01.040 --> 03:38:04.640]  A real alpha male doesn't want to run other people. We're confident
[03:38:04.880 --> 03:38:09.120]  But the problem is we don't want to run stuff. So the trash takes over so talk about that paradigm
[03:38:09.200 --> 03:38:11.200]  I mean, I you don't want to cover. I'm out of here. Go ahead
[03:38:12.000 --> 03:38:19.680]  Awesome. Yeah, I love the idea that uh, you're banned from twitter and I'm banned from twitter and facebook and all social media
[03:38:19.920 --> 03:38:23.680]  And then uh, I I see because look I got a way of looking at twitter
[03:38:24.480 --> 03:38:26.480]  I figure it out, uh
[03:38:26.960 --> 03:38:28.960]  Actually verified twitter accounts
[03:38:28.960 --> 03:38:30.960]  Louis Farrakhan
[03:38:31.120 --> 03:38:32.960]  is is is
[03:38:32.960 --> 03:38:35.200]  Alex Jones and Anthony Comeo worse
[03:38:35.920 --> 03:38:41.520]  Than minister. Louis Farrakhan who over the course of the years has just said the most repugnant
[03:38:42.160 --> 03:38:46.160]  Uh things about uh, uh, jewish people and others
[03:38:46.720 --> 03:38:49.360]  Uh, and um, I'm a dinnijad
[03:38:50.000 --> 03:38:52.000]  You might remember him
[03:38:52.000 --> 03:38:58.880]  Head muckity muck of um, Iran and and a former head muckity muck of iran and in 1979
[03:38:59.360 --> 03:39:03.360]  You could see pictures of him pop him up. He was one of the mechanics
[03:39:03.920 --> 03:39:06.400]  Of the americans being held hostage
[03:39:07.120 --> 03:39:10.720]  during uh, the uh, 1979 1980
[03:39:11.760 --> 03:39:17.600]  Uh in iran and he by the way is a a verified account holder
[03:39:17.600 --> 03:39:23.840]  At uh twitter, but meanwhile the likes of yes, alex jones and myself
[03:39:24.480 --> 03:39:28.960]  Are more I said I'd leave but here's the deal even though this is what Farrakhan says I've interviewed him
[03:39:29.280 --> 03:39:35.280]  He I think he has a right. I'm just we're not saying get rid of him. We're saying let anthony cumie and alex jones be on there
[03:39:36.560 --> 03:39:40.720]  That's it. I never look. I am an absolutist when it comes to free speech
[03:39:41.040 --> 03:39:45.760]  I don't care what Farrakhan has to say. I enjoy listening to some of Farrakhan stuff
[03:39:45.760 --> 03:39:50.400]  It it really gives you kind of a an outlook on what he's all about. He's quite an orator
[03:39:51.120 --> 03:39:56.000]  Oh my goodness. Yes, he is. I like how he talks about himself in the third person and uh
[03:39:56.560 --> 03:40:00.000]  The minister would say to you and it's like well, you are you're you're the minister
[03:40:00.960 --> 03:40:06.960]  But uh, the likes of uh him and i'm a dinijad. They have verified accounts twitter has deemed them
[03:40:07.680 --> 03:40:11.760]  acceptable to be on twitter, which is fine like you said, but
[03:40:11.760 --> 03:40:18.160]  But we alex are a pariah that needs to be removed for the over Darcy wrote
[03:40:18.560 --> 03:40:22.800]  Over 20 articles to call for me to be banned. He lied about me and got me banned on 20 something
[03:40:22.800 --> 03:40:25.680]  They gave him credit and I see this jerk and I walk over and I go
[03:40:26.080 --> 03:40:32.160]  Hey, man, you're like a hitler youth burning books getting me banned and they said calling him hitler youth is bullying
[03:40:32.320 --> 03:40:36.240]  He's a public figure. He's in public as a reporter. He got me banned. He bullied me
[03:40:36.240 --> 03:40:42.160]  I'm a hundred percent right to say you're hitler youth. The left calls us nazis all day when the shoe doesn't fit
[03:40:42.320 --> 03:40:44.880]  That's what I'm saying. And then they banned me
[03:40:45.920 --> 03:40:47.920]  It just pisses me off
[03:40:48.160 --> 03:40:50.560]  And they take yeah, they take us off
[03:40:51.280 --> 03:40:57.680]  For you know speaking our opinions and our ideas of of uh, is seeing in calling for all of us to be banned
[03:40:57.760 --> 03:40:59.760]  Is that not nazi like?
[03:40:59.760 --> 03:41:06.080]  It absolutely is and and if you're trying to it is like we've said a digital book burning
[03:41:06.400 --> 03:41:14.160]  There's no difference when you take somebody's points of view ideology opinions and say that these aren't fit
[03:41:14.800 --> 03:41:22.160]  For people to read or listen to or see it becomes a book burning for the new millennium as they say
[03:41:22.160 --> 03:41:26.720]  Why do they have I know I'm taking it. Why do they have no shame? They he was so smug
[03:41:26.720 --> 03:41:33.520]  And like laughing at me and it's like what I'm I cannot call myself to call for him to be banned
[03:41:34.000 --> 03:41:36.000]  Because he's no threat. No
[03:41:36.160 --> 03:41:40.560]  No, and I've never I've never asked for any person to be banned
[03:41:40.960 --> 03:41:45.280]  Everybody has the right to put their opinion out there ready to have the freaking, you know
[03:41:45.360 --> 03:41:47.440]  The green light come on and get in the racetrack
[03:41:48.320 --> 03:41:50.880]  But these guys they don't want to do that that they are scared
[03:41:50.880 --> 03:42:00.160]  No, they're petrified they I love when the the opposing point of view is shown because it gives me something to debate
[03:42:00.160 --> 03:42:05.040]  No, that's what I wake up. Exactly. We love debate. I beg them to come on. They won't come on
[03:42:05.680 --> 03:42:10.160]  They will never come on. They are petrified and they would rather silence
[03:42:10.720 --> 03:42:15.920]  Any opposition because they know that people might go, huh? Well, that guy's got a valid
[03:42:15.920 --> 03:42:21.520]  Well, it's like when Howard Stern or Howard Stern or you would have on some toothless retarded Nazi
[03:42:22.160 --> 03:42:28.080]  And it's like super entertaining and it's destroying them. They're not giving a nazi a platform. He sounds like a moron
[03:42:28.720 --> 03:42:33.360]  The light of day alex when you shine the light of day on a lot of these
[03:42:34.000 --> 03:42:38.080]  Ridiculous people it exposes them and that's the best thing

[03:48:47.280 --> 03:48:50.400]  Of course, we've talked about being booted off of social media
[03:48:50.800 --> 03:48:54.560]  Alex has been booted off. I've been booted off just for speaking our mind
[03:48:55.120 --> 03:48:57.120]  Just for speaking our mind in plain
[03:48:57.680 --> 03:48:58.640]  open
[03:48:58.640 --> 03:49:00.640]  uh fearless english
[03:49:01.280 --> 03:49:02.960]  and uh
[03:49:02.960 --> 03:49:06.800]  The the fact that that some of these companies have such power
[03:49:07.360 --> 03:49:09.120]  over what people
[03:49:09.120 --> 03:49:10.160]  hear
[03:49:10.160 --> 03:49:12.160]  see read
[03:49:12.160 --> 03:49:15.600]  Listen to it. It's amazing to me that
[03:49:16.240 --> 03:49:19.920]  Some people are fine with this. I hear it all the time freedom of speech
[03:49:20.720 --> 03:49:23.920]  Uh, oh, they're censoring and then you'll always get this. Well
[03:49:25.040 --> 03:49:30.880]  The freedom speech is the government can infringe on your freedom, but a private company
[03:49:30.880 --> 03:49:32.880]  can do whatever they want
[03:49:33.040 --> 03:49:35.280]  There's consequences to be shut up
[03:49:36.400 --> 03:49:38.400]  Shut up. Are you fine with that?
[03:49:38.960 --> 03:49:42.160]  I don't care what what your interpretation
[03:49:42.720 --> 03:49:45.440]  of what freedom of speech is as an american
[03:49:46.560 --> 03:49:56.320]  But mine certainly isn't a handful of companies deciding what everyone sees and hears or doesn't see in here because of their own
[03:49:57.040 --> 03:49:59.840]  uh agendas and political ideology
[03:49:59.840 --> 03:50:04.640]  Uh, so something. Yes, something has to be done. We can't just
[03:50:05.360 --> 03:50:10.240]  Just throw people off of what has uh turned into the public forum
[03:50:11.040 --> 03:50:12.800]  the town square
[03:50:12.800 --> 03:50:14.800]  the public room
[03:50:14.880 --> 03:50:15.760]  uh
[03:50:15.760 --> 03:50:20.560]  But that's exactly what they're doing and I believe things like this really point out
[03:50:21.520 --> 03:50:27.600]  That there's an issue here a valid issue that they are infringing on people's freedom of speech and
[03:50:27.600 --> 03:50:29.600]  Uh, endangering people
[03:50:30.160 --> 03:50:32.160]  I've been kicked off of twitter
[03:50:32.400 --> 03:50:36.640]  And uh, what does that mean? I can't get things like this from fema
[03:50:37.520 --> 03:50:39.280]  fema's on twitter
[03:50:39.280 --> 03:50:45.280]  there's a hurricane spinning out of control up the carolinas and um
[03:50:46.000 --> 03:50:50.960]  fema tweets things like if you're in a mandatory evacuation zone for florans
[03:50:50.960 --> 03:50:59.200]  Your window of time to leave is closing rapidly. Here are the zones for south carolina and they show
[03:51:00.720 --> 03:51:02.720]  Uh, a little map here. You could click on oh
[03:51:03.360 --> 03:51:04.480]  if
[03:51:04.480 --> 03:51:06.720]  If you're on twitter you could do that
[03:51:07.120 --> 03:51:10.400]  So I am not because I have said things
[03:51:11.040 --> 03:51:16.960]  That that some corporate people at twitter don't agree with i'm not entitled to get
[03:51:17.600 --> 03:51:19.440]  safety news
[03:51:19.440 --> 03:51:24.400]  from a medium a platform that has become a public forum
[03:51:25.200 --> 03:51:27.760]  for world leaders government agencies
[03:51:28.560 --> 03:51:30.400]  That that dole out
[03:51:30.400 --> 03:51:32.000]  safety information
[03:51:32.000 --> 03:51:37.520]  If there's a school shooting a lot of times twitter will put uh, uh, where to go what to do
[03:51:38.400 --> 03:51:41.200]  No, I don't get that because I was a bad boy
[03:51:42.400 --> 03:51:48.320]  What about the national uh hurricane center? What about their twitter? They have one. I don't
[03:51:48.320 --> 03:51:54.720]  So what I can't subscribe to these things and uh, uh, follow them on a twitter account
[03:51:54.720 --> 03:52:02.640]  So I can get instant up-to-date news on a life-threatening situation because I said something someone doesn't like
[03:52:03.440 --> 03:52:05.440]  Do not focus on the wind speed
[03:52:05.920 --> 03:52:13.840]  category of hurricane florans life-threatening storm surge flooding catastrophic flash flooding and prolonged significant river flooding
[03:52:13.840 --> 03:52:20.480]  Are still expected more. Here's a storm surge. Here's the map. Here's me not being able to click on it
[03:52:21.040 --> 03:52:24.800]  Or see it because uh, I said something
[03:52:25.600 --> 03:52:26.720]  naughty
[03:52:26.720 --> 03:52:28.000]  perhaps
[03:52:28.000 --> 03:52:30.000]  but here this is
[03:52:30.800 --> 03:52:32.800]  a valid argument
[03:52:33.200 --> 03:52:34.720]  to uh
[03:52:34.720 --> 03:52:39.920]  The idea that they should not have this kind of power over people. I'm being penalized
[03:52:39.920 --> 03:52:48.960]  Uh, and and perhaps other people's other people are being penalized and their their safety is now being jeopardized because they are not entitled
[03:52:49.760 --> 03:52:51.360]  to this
[03:52:51.360 --> 03:53:00.800]  National hurricane center statement or this FEMA statement that they could get on twitter yet. Look obviously you can go other places and get it
[03:53:01.600 --> 03:53:08.880]  But it's not the same thing as it popping up on something you follow the national hurricane center or FEMA
[03:53:08.880 --> 03:53:15.840]  Uh, during an emergency like this and then things pop up in your timeline. You don't have to go searching them out
[03:53:16.560 --> 03:53:20.240]  This is a safety issue that certain people are being denied
[03:53:20.800 --> 03:53:22.800]  because of their political ideology
[03:53:23.200 --> 03:53:25.200]  And I I'd be hard-pressed
[03:53:26.240 --> 03:53:28.960]  To find someone that could legitimately argue that
[03:53:30.080 --> 03:53:35.440]  With me, please argue that I'm not entitled because of political ideology
[03:53:35.440 --> 03:53:38.320]  to uh receive safety uh information
[03:53:38.880 --> 03:53:43.760]  From FEMA or the national hurricane center. No, you got a good argument for that
[03:53:44.240 --> 03:53:49.520]  You got something where maybe you were offended by something I said. So, uh, perhaps I should perish in a hurricane
[03:53:50.320 --> 03:53:55.200]  I might sound overdramatic, but if you're a liberal, uh, you get that because that's what you do
[03:53:55.920 --> 03:53:57.040]  um
[03:53:57.040 --> 03:54:04.480]  Another thing is uh, like I mentioned before Lewis Farrakhan and Ahmadinejad have verified accounts on twitter
[03:54:04.480 --> 03:54:12.960]  Verified accounts Ahmadinejad back in 1979 1980 was one of the mechanics of the hostage crisis
[03:54:13.840 --> 03:54:17.440]  in Iran when uh Americans were taken hostage
[03:54:17.920 --> 03:54:22.480]  Uh, and he's a good guy. He's good enough that twitter says, all right
[03:54:23.280 --> 03:54:26.480]  But this alex jones and anthony kumya. Yeah, they're horrible people
[03:54:27.680 --> 03:54:32.720]  And then we have um, hollywood, you know, I usually finish with a little hollywood
[03:54:32.720 --> 03:54:34.720]  Da da da da da da
[03:54:35.760 --> 03:54:41.280]  Hollywood because they're uh mental patients. They're mental patients in hollywood
[03:54:41.760 --> 03:54:47.520]  Norm mcdonald was uh, oh what a horrible human being he is. He's hilariously funny
[03:54:48.160 --> 03:54:54.160]  He's uh, you got such a quick wit and no fear, which is amazing. That's great for a comic
[03:54:54.320 --> 03:55:01.840]  That used to be looked up to in comedians now. Uh, he's apologizing and now they got him apologizing for an apology
[03:55:01.840 --> 03:55:03.840]  So norm mcdonald had the audacity
[03:55:05.840 --> 03:55:09.440]  To say that the me too movement has slowed down. He's happy with that
[03:55:09.920 --> 03:55:18.080]  It used to be 100 women can't be lying and then it became one woman can't be lying and then it became I believe all women
[03:55:18.480 --> 03:55:24.720]  And when you're like what like that chris hardwick guy, I really thought he got the blunt end of the stick there
[03:55:25.360 --> 03:55:27.120]  He's right
[03:55:27.120 --> 03:55:32.800]  We can't look at people even people like less moon vez where allegations have come in of sexual
[03:55:33.760 --> 03:55:38.240]  Harassment over the course of his tenure, uh before his tenure as head of cbs
[03:55:38.800 --> 03:55:40.800]  uh television
[03:55:40.800 --> 03:55:43.600]  Yeah, this was stuff was like before he was even with cbs
[03:55:44.640 --> 03:55:49.360]  You can't look at that and then like jud apatow says put him in prison
[03:55:49.920 --> 03:55:51.920]  Jud apatow is an idiot
[03:55:51.920 --> 03:55:58.000]  He's saying less moon vez should be put in prison and his money should be taken away and given to charity
[03:55:58.400 --> 03:56:01.280]  I I guess I missed the trial. Where was I?
[03:56:01.760 --> 03:56:06.000]  Where was I during the trial of less moon vez where he was found guilty?
[03:56:06.560 --> 03:56:11.360]  And a jury of his peers, uh, and the judge decided he should go to prison
[03:56:12.080 --> 03:56:14.080]  and lose all of his money
[03:56:14.160 --> 03:56:15.520]  because
[03:56:15.520 --> 03:56:17.520]  accusers said something
[03:56:17.600 --> 03:56:20.480]  Men have got to fight back
[03:56:20.480 --> 03:56:23.360]  This has gotten to the point where a woman
[03:56:24.080 --> 03:56:28.080]  That's being vindictive. Perhaps she was a scorned lover
[03:56:28.480 --> 03:56:34.480]  Perhaps she didn't get that promotion. She thought she deserved, but in the normal course of the corporate environment
[03:56:35.120 --> 03:56:37.120]  She didn't get it
[03:56:37.120 --> 03:56:44.240]  And now this this in case of emergency break glass thing is put in front of every woman now
[03:56:44.640 --> 03:56:48.640]  where they could just hit it make an accusation and
[03:56:48.640 --> 03:56:50.240]  and
[03:56:50.240 --> 03:56:51.840]  They're right
[03:56:51.840 --> 03:56:59.280]  They're right. They're the ones that were harassed. They're the ones that deserve money and and a better position
[03:57:00.080 --> 03:57:05.840]  Now, of course, I don't have to sit here and explain that people that were legitimately harassed have the right to
[03:57:06.240 --> 03:57:10.640]  Justice and perhaps some kind of compensation, but when you can't just believe
[03:57:11.360 --> 03:57:14.800]  Anybody and everybody because that's what people say
[03:57:14.800 --> 03:57:18.400]  Hey, uh, it's it's ludicrous ridiculous
