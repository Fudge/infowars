[13:21.440 --> 13:26.640]  into the criminal or psychiatric or welfare system for doing things that
[13:26.640 --> 13:31.280]  aren't illegal or aren't even uncivil all kids do this you're not allowed to run
[13:31.280 --> 13:35.440]  play dodgeball you're not allowed to shake hands they're they're they're

[13:57.040 --> 14:01.680]  totally turn your children against you to the little boy's mother it was just a
[14:01.680 --> 14:05.680]  six-year-old playing around but Mason Jammer the kindergarten student at
[14:05.680 --> 14:15.000]  Jefferson Elementary and IO NIA curled his fist into the shape of a gun
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.880]  Wednesday and pointed another student school officials said it was no laughing
[14:18.880 --> 14:24.040]  matter you are a prisoner they suspended Mason until Friday saying the
[14:24.040 --> 14:28.920]  behavior made other students uncomfortable said Aaron Jammer
[14:28.920 --> 14:35.440]  Mason's mother school officials not servants officials authorities school
[14:35.440 --> 14:38.320]  officials alleged Mason had displayed this kind of behavior for several months
[14:38.320 --> 14:43.200]  despite numerous warnings I do think it's too harsh for a six-year-old said
[14:43.200 --> 14:46.840]  Jammer who was previously warned that if Mason continued the practice he would be
[14:46.840 --> 14:51.680]  suspended he's six he just likes to play so see the video games the TV the
[14:51.680 --> 14:56.120]  culture is all violence there's that message and you know police tazering and
[14:56.120 --> 15:00.880]  killing people and troops slaughtering that's all good but then you draw a
[15:00.880 --> 15:05.000]  picture of a gun or bring a two inch GI Joe gun in your pocket you get
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.240]  suspended you get arrested it's total mind control and soon will be like

[16:29.440 --> 16:34.880]  give up their national treasures their national parks their islands everything
[16:34.880 --> 16:39.040]  must go to the private bankers who loaned them fiat money backed up by the

[16:46.520 --> 16:52.920]  Reserve has beaten a move by Senator Chris Dodd to let the Senate have some

[17:25.960 --> 17:29.120]  and it's all secret and they won't say where it goes but then it comes out that
[17:29.120 --> 17:33.400]  it's going to them as bonuses and it's totally illegal and that's just the way
[17:33.400 --> 17:37.480]  it is because they're lawless crooks and they're going to watch your kids on the

[24:39.000 --> 24:45.880]  from ESPN by Robert Montgomery their outdoors reporter the Obama
[24:45.880 --> 24:51.120]  administration will accept no more public input for a federal strategy that
[24:51.120 --> 24:55.720]  could prohibit US citizens from fishing in nations oceans coastal areas great
[24:55.720 --> 25:00.200]  lakes and even inland waters but the big mass fishing trawlers from Japan and
[25:00.200 --> 25:04.840]  everywhere else they can sit 12 miles off shore and they're the ones that are
[25:04.840 --> 25:08.920]  overfishing in many areas but you can't go out with your grandson and fish you
[25:08.920 --> 25:12.280]  gotta get a special federal license they want you to have a passport to go out
[25:12.280 --> 25:18.320]  on the boat I mean this is total UN control of the water ways so that is
[25:18.320 --> 25:29.360]  coming up as well we will also get into all the latest police state news the
[25:29.360 --> 25:36.360]  report of the new bill that we've been covering in detail the centers to be
[25:36.360 --> 25:42.320]  detained as enemy belligerents this is unspeakably hardcore and tyrannical but
[25:42.320 --> 25:44.800]  right now for the rest of the hour let's start going to your phone calls
[25:44.800 --> 25:49.600]  Bert in Louisiana you're on the air how you doing Alex pretty good I'm calling
[25:49.600 --> 25:55.320]  about last June 14th my daughter passed away from swine flew up in Chicago well
[25:55.320 --> 26:00.000]  we're up in Wisconsin she got sick took her to the hospital there they
[26:00.000 --> 26:03.980]  supposedly took a swine flu test came back negative that night they
[26:03.980 --> 26:08.720]  transported her from Chicago I mean from Wisconsin to the University of
[26:08.720 --> 26:15.080]  Chicago and downtown within 12 hours she was on a respirator and I never got a
[26:15.080 --> 26:18.960]  chance to speak to her again but the point I'm getting to is when we arrived
[26:18.960 --> 26:23.640]  in Chicago at that hospital they were supposedly taking us fine flu test but
[26:23.640 --> 26:27.560]  they dropped the ball five days later I'm sitting in that room hugging all my
[26:27.560 --> 26:31.080]  daughter kissing all my daughter and they run in there and they tell me to
[26:31.080 --> 26:35.280]  get out get out she has swine flu and I'm like well it's a little late for this
[26:35.280 --> 26:40.680]  but the point I'm getting at is she had an underlying condition of sarcopathosis
[26:40.680 --> 26:47.040]  okay and when they got her there after the fifth day they put her on 72 bottles
[26:47.040 --> 26:53.240]  of perpidol in 72 hours a bottle an hour and after that her organs shut down and
[26:53.240 --> 26:56.880]  and she didn't make it I believe wholeheartedly that they used her as a
[26:56.880 --> 27:03.880]  and the purpose of really what killed my daughter well your phone cut out for a
[27:03.880 --> 27:09.400]  moment did you say they used her as a guinea pig yeah that's what I because
[27:09.400 --> 27:14.200]  I don't think you could give anybody 72 bottles of perpidol that's what killed
[27:14.200 --> 27:19.520]  Michael Jackson in 72 hours and even the nurses started looking at me like we
[27:19.520 --> 27:24.080]  don't know what's going on here mr. Campbell and a matter of fact I talked
[27:24.080 --> 27:28.200]  to the head doctor there and he was he was an Obama supporter so you know I
[27:28.200 --> 27:32.560]  don't I don't with with my daughter I didn't pay attention to that but well
[27:32.560 --> 27:36.680]  Bert let me just say this we're very sorry for your loss and I have children
[27:36.680 --> 27:41.080]  and it causes me great pain and anxiety just to hear about a father losing a
[27:41.080 --> 27:46.520]  precious daughter but let me just say this over 300,000 Americans according to
[27:46.520 --> 27:51.320]  the federal government died from bad drug interactions every year another 200
[27:51.320 --> 27:55.120]  plus thousand die of hospital infections and my father is an oral surgeon and a
[27:55.120 --> 27:59.400]  dentist and he has told me my entire life don't go to the hospital unless you
[27:59.400 --> 28:05.200]  absolutely have to they are full of deadly bugs the malpractice is incredible
[28:05.200 --> 28:09.960]  they're understaffed a lot of the nurses don't know what they're doing and we
[28:09.960 --> 28:17.680]  hear these horror stories all the time we know that this swine flu well we had
[28:17.680 --> 28:22.120]  a record low overall seasonal flu last year in this year that's been reported
[28:22.120 --> 28:26.280]  by even the Associated Press and Wall Street Journal record low numbered
[28:26.280 --> 28:32.440]  deaths from the swine flu itself and a lot of people did die from complications
[28:32.440 --> 28:37.960]  of Guillain-Barre and other neurological disorders from the swine flu shot but in
[28:37.960 --> 28:44.520]  major medical journals they said don't give the different anti flu drugs to
[28:44.520 --> 28:50.800]  people that have this it can actually trigger an autoimmune response in the
[28:50.800 --> 28:56.760]  lungs similar to hemorrhagic fever and cause the lungs to flood and and they
[28:56.760 --> 29:01.680]  have to go on a respirator and they a lot of times die the Tama flu and other
[29:01.680 --> 29:05.480]  things that they know did nothing against the H1N1 but they still pushed
[29:05.480 --> 29:14.320]  it and so it's just horrible to hear that she died from this and you know
[29:14.320 --> 29:17.320]  they told you she hadn't died from it and they told you she had died from it
[29:17.320 --> 29:21.280]  who knows what the hospital did they may have given her a swine flu shot
[29:21.280 --> 29:24.640]  without telling you I mean they all over the country gave elementary school
[29:24.640 --> 29:28.440]  students secretly the flu shot because they thought they couldn't explain it
[29:28.440 --> 29:33.400]  to their parents and Bert I'm just really sad to hear this happen one more
[29:33.400 --> 29:36.800]  thing here if there's any lawyer out there that wants to look into that I
[29:36.800 --> 29:42.320]  think this would be a good case to show that they it was a fraud on on the
[29:42.320 --> 29:48.080]  American people how do people contact you at part camo at basketball Louisiana

[33:30.280 --> 33:34.800]  private corporations using the power of government to rob and loot and steal from
[33:34.800 --> 33:39.360]  the rest of us and it's not going to get any better until we take our counties
[33:39.360 --> 33:42.880]  and cities and states and the federal government back from the New World Order
[33:42.880 --> 33:46.400]  and that's what Iceland's doing coming up in about an hour and a half we're
[33:46.400 --> 33:49.920]  gonna have folks on from Iceland actually in the last hour come up in about two
[33:49.920 --> 33:54.000]  and a half hours we're gonna have Brigitte Jones dot to year one of the
[33:54.000 --> 34:00.800]  leaders of the parliament who led the move to say no to Goldman Sachs and
[34:00.800 --> 34:06.960]  others that came in and designed the implosion of their economy so that is
[34:06.960 --> 34:12.560]  coming up on the subject of hospitals killing people hey have you got a broken
[34:12.560 --> 34:16.640]  leg or you got a gunshot wound or you get run over by a car the hospital is
[34:16.640 --> 34:25.800]  great and the miracles of modern medicine are incredible but I have had two
[34:25.800 --> 34:33.240]  friends close friends who went in to have minor surgeries
[34:35.360 --> 34:40.480]  like I start thinking about it it's more than two close friends and they get an
[34:40.480 --> 34:44.400]  infection in the hospital and they die
[34:47.080 --> 34:53.320]  the hospital is a very dangerous place to be
[34:55.320 --> 35:02.440]  and it's getting a lot worse we should do a whole show on that sometime 300 plus
[35:02.440 --> 35:06.520]  thousand deaths a year just from drug interactions I watch these drug ads and
[35:06.520 --> 35:10.200]  some of them are a minute long they'll have 20 seconds showing happy people
[35:10.200 --> 35:13.360]  walking through a field because they're taking the drug and then there'll be 40
[35:13.360 --> 35:18.000]  seconds of some died during trials of the drug others have heart attacks
[35:18.000 --> 35:22.000]  kidney failure liver failure may cause mania may cause schizophrenia may cause
[35:22.000 --> 35:28.080]  obsessive gambling may cause and you hear these ads it's like a joke I mean
[35:28.080 --> 35:33.840]  they know the Gardasil shot has killed masses of people that took it the live
[35:33.840 --> 35:38.160]  cancer virus shot to supposedly protect you from cervical cancer that only
[35:38.160 --> 35:46.720]  kills a few thousand people a day a few thousand people a year excuse me and it's
[35:46.720 --> 35:52.200]  way down the line for cancers that kill people things like bone cancer brain
[35:52.200 --> 35:58.160]  cancer lung cancer that are big killers they say no we have this shot that and
[35:58.160 --> 36:06.160]  then they admit on the drug insert that it doesn't even protect you from the
[36:06.160 --> 36:12.040]  human papillomavirus and they say you must take it all schoolgirls must take
[36:12.040 --> 36:16.480]  it governor Perry says so then it turns out he just told the health department
[36:16.480 --> 36:21.400]  the state health department to make it be on the list of compulsory shots to
[36:21.400 --> 36:25.760]  attend school which itself isn't a law and by law they're ordered to give you a
[36:25.760 --> 36:29.480]  waiver but they don't they lie to you and say it's the law and then other
[36:29.480 --> 36:33.760]  states adopted it and said you must take the shot it's the law when it was not
[36:33.760 --> 36:38.960]  the law the same governments around the world using government-issued laptops to
[36:38.960 --> 36:46.920]  watch pupils at home in their bedrooms the same government worldwide that's
[36:46.920 --> 36:51.280]  been taking blood for 37 years and a secret UN program from all children at
[36:51.280 --> 36:56.640]  birth now declassified just a lawless group that does whatever they want
[36:56.640 --> 37:04.720]  whenever they want I'm gonna go back to Guy Dan Chris and others here in just a
[37:04.720 --> 37:09.920]  moment we've got a lot of key news coming up the next hour before Lieutenant
[37:09.920 --> 37:15.560]  Colonel Anthony Schaefer joins us but for the next five minutes I wanted to
[37:15.560 --> 37:19.560]  bring a great sponsor on the air whether she joins us once a month he's Marty
[37:19.560 --> 37:24.680]  Schachter he has the best and lowest price and when I say that it's 85% off
[37:24.680 --> 37:31.320]  supermarket prices for the dangerous detergents and petrochemical byproducts
[37:31.320 --> 37:36.160]  that they tell the public is soap you walk down the aisle your eyes start
[37:36.160 --> 37:41.000]  watering it's 85% off that normally organic soaps are more than the toxic
[37:41.000 --> 37:44.840]  garbage but because you get it factory direct you get 85% off they've been
[37:44.840 --> 37:51.360]  around since 1947 that is the longest continually operating organic true soap
[37:51.360 --> 37:55.800]  company in the nation and so I wanted Marty Schachter to give you his basic
[37:55.800 --> 38:00.240]  product line give you his toll-free number and website Marty good to have
[38:00.240 --> 38:04.240]  you on with us good morning Alex a pleasure talking to you and your
[38:04.240 --> 38:08.600]  listeners I've always got so much information to share what I need is an
[38:08.600 --> 38:13.520]  hour but I know in five minutes we'll try to condense it down what you didn't
[38:13.520 --> 38:19.200]  discuss I did mention was corruption in the chemical industry in the so-called
[38:19.200 --> 38:25.120]  soap industry now they're using the word soap but they also eliminated the word
[38:25.120 --> 38:33.440]  before soap and that word is synthetic artificial felt fake ain't real not
[38:33.440 --> 38:39.200]  natural and all those terms were eliminated because a bad PR but when
[38:39.200 --> 38:43.760]  they say so they don't be real soap they don't mean coconut oils and vegetable
[38:43.760 --> 38:49.480]  oils they mean synthetic chemicals that are toxic that outgas you that you've
[38:49.480 --> 38:53.560]  got to wear a respirator when you go to the supermarket from all the fumes
[38:53.560 --> 38:58.280]  coming massive for those that don't know massive studies have been linked to the
[38:58.280 --> 39:03.160]  huge upswing and asthma from the type of chemicals that are in hair care and
[39:03.160 --> 39:08.700]  and lotions and different detergent based soaps I mean we are we are just
[39:08.700 --> 39:13.080]  bathing in the chemical waste but separately when we know their stuff's

[44:24.480 --> 44:28.320]  hear from you let's go to Guy in New Jersey go ahead hey Alex how you doing
[44:28.320 --> 44:32.880]  good all right I wanted to bring to everyone's attention this article out
[44:32.880 --> 44:37.680]  of true slant I suggest everyone go to Google right now type in normalizing the
[44:37.680 --> 44:42.240]  police state and go to the first article now in the article it brings up
[44:42.240 --> 44:47.240]  several examples of you know all this police state news such as old women
[44:47.240 --> 44:51.640]  get tatered you know kids get tatered for who knows drawing on the desk and
[44:51.640 --> 44:55.360]  things like that but I want to bring to your attention that you brought up in
[44:55.360 --> 45:02.880]  the past about this advanced white control agents now you talk about microwave
[45:02.880 --> 45:09.120]  guns sound cannons everything correct and this article it brings up out of the
[45:09.120 --> 45:15.360]  Penn State College medical research they bring up you know dispersing in the
[45:15.360 --> 45:21.560]  air like a valium and a close act in all this to you know quality for those that
[45:21.560 --> 45:25.680]  don't know the government's talking in the US and Japan about putting lithium
[45:25.680 --> 45:30.160]  and anti-psychotic that's toxic in the water because it doesn't break down for
[45:30.160 --> 45:34.280]  a long time and actually gets delivered to the nervous system and yes I am
[45:34.280 --> 45:37.840]  aware of the government's been doing studies of spraying valium or other
[45:37.840 --> 45:43.040]  drugs into the air I didn't know that was in an article what's the title of
[45:43.040 --> 45:47.000]  the article normalizing the police state correct and that's out of true slant
[45:47.000 --> 45:52.040]  and I just wanted to bring up at the very that's probably the middle of the
[45:52.040 --> 45:56.240]  page it talks about how they would disperse it in the air and it would be
[45:56.240 --> 46:00.280]  that are they saying it's good because in my experience true slant attacks
[46:00.280 --> 46:05.600]  yours truly about every week is an absolute George Soros type operation
[46:05.600 --> 46:10.000]  actually no with this is whoever wrote this I'm not sure who the woman is
[46:10.000 --> 46:16.640]  exactly but well good for her very against it so what are they saying you
[46:16.640 --> 46:19.680]  know that they just bring up all you know some of the examples about the
[46:19.680 --> 46:23.080]  police saying how it's growing in America but I just want to bring up how
[46:23.080 --> 46:28.760]  they would disperse it would be through artillery shells it would disperse over
[46:28.760 --> 46:32.480]  you know they could scatter up to a hundred and fifty two canisters over a
[46:32.480 --> 46:38.720]  hundred thousand square foot area first in chemicals and parachuting it down so
[46:38.720 --> 46:42.880]  this is literally would be yeah I see the report I see the report and I'm glad
[46:42.880 --> 46:47.720]  you called guy excellent points look three years ago the head of the Air
[46:47.720 --> 46:53.560]  Force the civilian head the secretary of the Air Force came out and said under
[46:53.560 --> 46:58.120]  international law we can't use microwave guns and sound cannons in war
[46:58.120 --> 47:01.960]  theaters but if we start using in our citizens then we can argue an
[47:01.960 --> 47:07.040]  international court that it's not a tool of warfare and yes they've got taser
[47:07.040 --> 47:11.800]  drones they've got nerve gas drones they've got knockout gas drones they're
[47:11.800 --> 47:17.200]  taking all our tax money and organizing the government in an offensive
[47:17.200 --> 47:25.560]  predatory posture against the people and it's just absolutely horrible that
[47:25.560 --> 47:29.320]  this is going on but yes I do have the article now and I do see the link to the
[47:29.320 --> 47:34.040]  university study on it and this is all part of the Darth Vader uniforms I told
[47:34.040 --> 47:37.440]  people ten years ago that was about intimidation and then five years ago they
[47:37.440 --> 47:41.120]  had a law enforcement symposium and a bunch of police chiefs what the Maryland
[47:41.120 --> 47:44.360]  police chief was one of them said yeah we wear the black uniforms and masks to
[47:44.360 --> 47:49.280]  intimidate people and hide our identity we're here to intimidate the people you've
[47:49.280 --> 47:52.840]  got a lawless government robbing everyone in every case in history they
[47:52.840 --> 47:56.160]  hire a bunch of thugs and get them all hyped up that the people are the enemy
[47:56.160 --> 48:00.520]  and the government stages terror attacks against itself to make all the cops go
[48:00.520 --> 48:04.000]  into psychosis and feel sorry for themselves and now they're out tasering
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.880]  old ladies and thumb printing people to roller skate or skateboard and beating
[48:07.880 --> 48:12.080]  people up and it's just it's going to get worse and worse and worse and they're
[48:12.080 --> 48:15.840]  going to take your pension funds to cops I know smart cops know that and we're
[48:15.840 --> 48:19.080]  turning into a third-world country from the richest freest nation to the most
[48:19.080 --> 48:23.680]  enslaved overnight and now CNN praises Mao Zedong and says he's great the
[48:23.680 --> 48:28.840]  biggest mass murderer in history Dan in Pennsylvania you're on the air hello
[48:28.840 --> 48:33.880]  Alex yes sir yes this is about the um aspartame in the in the gum and
[48:33.880 --> 48:37.000]  everything that you've been talking about yeah every grocery store I go
[48:37.000 --> 48:43.080]  everywhere I go I can I mean literally I cannot find gum sugar gum without
[48:43.080 --> 48:50.040]  aspartame added which is a chemical weapon check this out okay go and check
[48:50.040 --> 48:54.560]  out I don't want to do a placement of any gum kind but I don't care go ahead
[48:54.560 --> 49:00.400]  yeah bubble licious burst that has that's okay cuz I personally don't you
[49:00.400 --> 49:06.200]  gum but my wife does so we really have researched this then also bubble yum
[49:06.200 --> 49:15.280]  bubble gum okay doesn't have aspartame in it and also tic-tacs yes we get tic-tacs
[49:15.280 --> 49:20.040]  for our children you know kind of like rewards and we're out shopping or
[49:20.040 --> 49:26.920]  something when they're good as it's like trained seals but but tic-tacs don't
[49:26.920 --> 49:31.040]  have aspartame at least they say they don't but you try to get tried it gum
[49:31.040 --> 49:36.680]  you try to get I mean literally I cannot find it at the store without it but I'm
[49:36.680 --> 49:40.560]  glad you found some I was in a toy store last week buying my children some
[49:40.560 --> 49:45.560]  board games and I noticed they had a in cap of beeman's gum that's like a hundred
[49:45.560 --> 49:49.760]  year old gum company and it didn't have any aspartame in it and I thought it was
[49:49.760 --> 49:57.040]  delicious but I appreciate your call Dan Chris in Florida you're on the air he
[49:57.040 --> 50:04.000]  just dropped Kyoto in Virginia go ahead I have a question about Iceland what do
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.840]  you think is going to be the consequence of them not paying the banks
[50:06.840 --> 50:10.360]  because I heard that they're not going to be able to borrow any more money and
[50:10.360 --> 50:14.760]  not join the European nation Union the globalist will probably stage terror
[50:14.760 --> 50:18.640]  attacks there or they'll probably poison or assassinate leaders but the
[50:18.640 --> 50:22.720]  problem is the country's so awake and so angry they're now openly talking about

[54:50.960 --> 54:59.280]  documentary film that is just unbelievably powerful in fact I saw a
[54:59.280 --> 55:03.200]  mainstream news article doing a review of it calling it new world order on trial
[55:03.200 --> 55:09.520]  that's a great way to put it but it's very very important documentary titled
[55:09.520 --> 55:14.040]  invisible empire a new world order to find that will premiere tax day April
[55:14.040 --> 55:23.160]  15th at prisonplanet.tv but I want to go back to your calls was it Jim I was
[55:23.160 --> 55:28.800]  talking to John because I was gonna go back to Bert and I see that his calls
[55:28.800 --> 55:33.080]  been taken off the list he dropped off okay I'm holding the hold there I want
[55:33.080 --> 55:36.720]  to try to answer his question he was saying how do we get a movement like
[55:36.720 --> 55:42.760]  that going here what you got 400,000 people roughly just shy of that living
[55:42.760 --> 55:50.160]  in Iceland okay and they're highly educated on average one of the lowest
[55:50.160 --> 55:55.120]  crime rates in the world and the banks came in and set up a derivative scheme
[55:55.120 --> 56:00.520]  with their government and basically leverage them 10 times their GDP a year
[56:00.520 --> 56:05.520]  that's a conservative estimate to get control of the nation's resources they
[56:05.520 --> 56:09.640]  come in with fiat derivatives instruments they know we're gonna
[56:09.640 --> 56:14.800]  implode in value they make money selling it to them and then when the country
[56:14.800 --> 56:20.520]  collapses the banks come in and say we own you and a year and a half ago they
[56:20.520 --> 56:24.560]  were seizing Icelanders bank accounts because the big banks there are Dutch
[56:24.560 --> 56:29.760]  British and US owned the three dominant you can search engine the term
[56:29.760 --> 56:34.920]  anti-terror laws or terror laws used against Iceland and the British
[56:34.920 --> 56:39.720]  government would seize people's bank accounts and would seize government
[56:39.720 --> 56:44.480]  resources and tried to block food being imported into the country well that made
[56:44.480 --> 56:49.120]  the public mad for over a year they demonstrated and rioted in some cases
[56:49.120 --> 56:54.240]  and took over banks and protested and then the banks threatened to totally
[56:54.240 --> 56:58.920]  shut the country down they said fine we don't owe you this money and this weekend
[56:58.920 --> 57:02.120]  they passed a referendum saying they're not gonna pay him the money it's not
[57:02.120 --> 57:09.640]  owed and the banks should be arrested they're a bunch of made-offs types this
[57:09.640 --> 57:16.440]  is a major Western country saying no identifying the criminality instead of
[57:16.440 --> 57:22.840]  paving the streets with gold for the corrupt oligarchs the people are saying
[57:22.840 --> 57:27.800]  no to them and the banks have now backed off they said okay fine fine we
[57:27.800 --> 57:33.080]  already own enough assets in Iceland to pay this off turned out it was all the
[57:33.080 --> 57:39.200]  fraud the banks didn't even need it when I was on CBC radio today nationwide it
[57:39.200 --> 57:44.840]  was actually taped it's airing tomorrow morning they say I made the point to
[57:44.840 --> 57:49.720]  them that the banks are getting more power record bonuses bragging that they
[57:49.720 --> 57:54.120]  engineered the crisis and then they cut to the other guess they had on it just
[57:54.120 --> 57:57.160]  said I wasn't telling the truth that the banks would never want to hurt the
[57:57.160 --> 58:01.720]  economy and that this isn't true well it doesn't matter if the establishment
[58:01.720 --> 58:05.680]  sits up there and tells you the banks are loving and good and sweet and don't
[58:05.680 --> 58:09.280]  worry they've got a plan for a world government to fix the global economic
[58:09.280 --> 58:17.040]  you collapse the people know who the enemy is we've identified the banks but
[58:17.040 --> 58:23.040]  in America we're not as awake as Iceland because people are still fighting
[58:23.040 --> 58:27.800]  amongst themselves Republican and Democrat the divide and conquer
[58:27.800 --> 58:31.800]  the left-right paradigm but more and more that's getting shattered and so
[58:31.800 --> 58:36.040]  instead of worrying about the puppet Obama or the puppet you know senator
[58:36.040 --> 58:41.360]  Graham let's talk about the actual criminal bankers
[58:41.360 --> 58:51.200]  you are listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com today this is Alex Jones with
[58:51.200 --> 58:54.960]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[58:54.960 --> 58:58.720]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:58.720 --> 59:03.240]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[59:03.240 --> 59:06.800]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[59:06.800 --> 59:11.200]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[59:11.200 --> 59:15.520]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[59:15.520 --> 59:19.280]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:19.280 --> 59:23.360]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:23.360 --> 59:27.120]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[59:27.120 --> 59:31.160]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[59:31.160 --> 59:33.880]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[59:33.880 --> 59:39.920]  science one of my old sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:23.160]  Alex Jones
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:35.280]  I was just talking to Tyrell the turn there in the break citing stuff going on
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:41.280]  we'll be talking about with Jesse Ventura coming up his father on Friday
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:44.400]  here all right let's continue with some phone calls we're going live at
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.480]  prisonplanet.tv in about seven minutes and I want to go through a bunch of
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:52.680]  news and we'll continue with your calls and three very informative guest coming
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:58.920]  up let's talk to Jim in Illinois you're on the air Jim hey Alex I was wondering
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:03.200]  at Friday when you talk to Bob you could have them go into specifics on how
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:06.600]  they're gonna take the pension funds because I've been trying to tell people
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.960]  that they won't a lot of companies are already doing it I mean a lot of
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:14.760]  companies move their assets out then the company goes belly up and the bankers
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:19.080]  and shareholders the dominant shareholders preposition themselves and
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:22.400]  actually take your pension funds it's already going on the federal government's
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:26.440]  announced they may take government and private pension funds to quote protect
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:32.040]  them take part of the money tax it and then dole it out to you yeah and then
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.920]  and then one other thing I was wondering I don't know maybe this might make your
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:39.480]  job a little easier if like maybe you you could set up like a website where you
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:44.280]  could have like all your ghost your gas like Chapman and Tarpley and all those
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:48.040]  regulars where they could have like a weekly update and then we can we can go
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:51.000]  down there and download it because I make copies all your movies and pass them
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.880]  out because sometimes when they you know you guys got to cover so much when I
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.720]  hand this stuff to people they think it's crazy but where they could go into
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:02.080]  specifics and then we could go every week and download it you do know what I
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:06.160]  mean or no yeah but that's like I mean I mean it's hard enough to get to get
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:10.480]  guests on the air and run my radio show and make films and do everything else
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:15.040]  we're doing I mean look if the public wants to be slaves and they want to be
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.640]  bankrupt and they want to be I mean it's not going to be like a happy meal
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:23.000]  given to them through the window and in 10 seconds we do archive all the

[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:05.440]  things down making it simple what like a reader's digest we do that every day
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:11.080]  with big boil down articles where we analyze okay here's a bill for national
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:16.600]  ID cards to have a job we already have national ID cards and they're gonna make
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:20.740]  the illegals legal and at one fell swoop make everyone have to have these to
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:25.000]  have a job and then just legalize the illegals that's in the Wall Street
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.080]  Journal today and there's an article by Kurt Nemo Schumer Graham use immigration
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:34.560]  to push national biometric ID card for American citizens and look look I'm not
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:39.560]  mad at you Jim and I like listener ideas but it does become somewhat of a pet
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:43.720]  peeve not with you but with the people you're trying to wake up that you say
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:47.160]  you send them say an interview with Bob Chapman or Dr. Paul Craig Roberts or
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:53.680]  Max Kaiser or any of these other brokers or economists or Ron Paul and you know
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:58.400]  then they say well this is too long okay well listen it's not too long for you to
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:07.680]  watch lost or house or dancing with the stars or the state of the Union or to
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:13.080]  play 10 hours a day of video games and so that's what you want you know those
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:17.000]  people that won't listen to you Jim when you lovingly try to wake them up they
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.400]  don't want to be informed they want to go watch on average four and a half hours
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:25.640]  of TV a day and two hours of video games and text message their friends and look
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:29.600]  at porno all day and they want to get drunk and be lazy so they're gonna get
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:34.320]  robbed when you get lazy and ignorant stupid corrupt parasites predators move
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:38.360]  in and rape the hell out of you and so they're getting hit hard and they're
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:44.240]  gonna get hit a lot worse because they don't care they don't care about a
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:47.880]  million dead Iraqis in a fake war well the police state didn't care about it

[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:14.200]  thank you Wall Street Journal today ID card for workers is at center of
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:21.920]  immigration plan this is a complete retread of what the CFR report said six
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:25.760]  years ago they write many of the big Homeland Security policies then it gets
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:32.280]  passed as law ID card for workers this is the amnesty plan they tried to pass in
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:40.680]  2005 2006 and 2007 and then again they didn't get it up even to a vote but they
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:47.960]  try to fourth time unsuccessfully in 2008 now remember that by the third time
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:52.080]  they were failing they said we're gonna make the amnesty plan secret that was
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:58.280]  the headlines Senate keeps details of amnesty plan of immigrant plans secret
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:03.840]  you can pull those articles up that we did pull them up and this is the
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:10.560]  deception of government and then senator sessions to his credit would not go along
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:18.480]  with it and he linked it he had the 20 smoking guns piece that he wrote giving
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:23.840]  the subsections of the bill not only complete total amnesty but all illegal
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:28.000]  aliens would be legalized including felons aggravated felons rapist
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:35.560]  arsonist armed robbers this is in the bill and they would swear to not do it
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:40.640]  again and be completely legalized and for six years it was sunset it out after
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:45.520]  six years they could bring unlimited family members into the United States so
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:49.520]  you think it's bad with 30 million illegals driving down wages bankrupting
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:53.320]  the welfare system hundreds of millions of people wanting to come here
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:57.760]  imagine what this would do allowing them to bring in massive amounts of family
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:06.120]  it was a total amnesty plan it was more than that it was a complete and total
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:12.240]  well the equivalent of a gubernatorial a presidential pardon for criminals now in
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:15.000]  that plan and remember this was written up by the security and prosperity
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.720]  partnership at their Banff Canada meeting in 2006 and judicial watch
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:25.920]  sued and got the documents it stated we're going to sell legalization in the
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:29.560]  name of legalizing the immigrants will make them completely legal will give
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:34.920]  them a work ID card they'll have to have but then citizens will have to have this
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:39.680]  to have a job not just your federalized driver's license and to back that up I
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:50.120]  pulled up human events from 717 2006 and it says are you ready for the North
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:56.240]  American Union ID card and then it goes in to the SPP internal documents so
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:00.800]  that's human events newspaper and of course Lou Dobbs covered it at the time
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:06.040]  this new legislation is identical and it's public but they're selling it oh
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:10.040]  we're gonna we're gonna criminalize the illegals well yeah because the
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:13.920]  illegals won't be illegal anymore it's a lawyer mind trick it's like Clinton
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:19.000]  saying well it depends on what the definition of is is it saying we don't
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.040]  want global government we want global governance governance means government
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:27.880]  and in the encyclopedia Britannica so they play these little games and Kurt
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:32.040]  Nemo has written a boil down he links to this article in a key story he wrote
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:36.280]  this morning Schumer Graham use immigration to push national biometric
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:40.960]  ID card now as usual before they can even pass this they're already
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:47.040]  implementing five states already put taxes carbon taxes on cars that they
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:52.520]  claim used too much fuel they've passed no laws federally to do this they're
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:56.920]  just doing it back here's an example new cars in California must display global
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:01.400]  warming score and there's a tax that's assessed on the auto dealer that's passed
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:04.600]  on to the customer fact here's that article new cars in California must
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:10.120]  display global warming score and here's an actual photo of one one of our
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:15.480]  California listeners sent us global warming score smog score made up global
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:22.040]  warming not scientific a fraud but they're going to tax you and the Senate
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:25.600]  announced that they're gonna go ahead and try to pass a bill to just put taxes
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:30.360]  on all fuel at the refinery and this is what the oil companies are asking for
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:37.720]  that was in the New York Times Sunday oil companies request all Exxon mobile
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:41.240]  Dutch Royal Shell all of them requesting the taxes because they're
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:45.720]  owned and run by the big central banks that came out two years ago David
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:49.320]  Rockefeller went to a Dutch Royal Shell meeting he went to an Exxon mobile
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:53.040]  meeting he owned a bunch of stock and Exxon mobile he said I'm gonna fire you
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:56.960]  Rex Tillerson if you don't do this and so they said okay we got religion it's
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:05.480]  real but we'll just pass the tax on go ahead and head us now the reason in
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:08.800]  fact here's another Wall Street Journal article about it
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:14.640]  eco-nomics creating environmental capital and it's the head of Dutch Royal
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:19.640]  Shell Peter Vosser you know all the heads of the big oil companies right
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:28.920]  here saying that they want these taxes this is in the Wall Street Journal so
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:32.960]  every time you hear oh you work for the oil companies you don't want all these
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:36.520]  taxes you're saying global warming isn't real the oil companies especially
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:41.440]  Dutch Royal Shell BP and others for 20 years have been pushing this this is run
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:44.920]  by them just like the health care takeover was written by the insurance
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:48.200]  companies and every time it looks like it's about to pass their stock shoots
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:53.000]  up they gave four times the money to Obama they did McCain because he
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.880]  promised to ram this through that matter McCain supporting it as well so
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:02.760]  Schumer Graham use immigration to push national biometric ID card now again
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:10.440]  before they can even pass this law the government offers it to the slaves oh
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:14.880]  you travel from the US to Mexico or from Mexico to the US or from the US to
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:18.760]  Canada what they don't tell you in the Canadian TV ads that are produced
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:23.160]  exactly the same fact we've shown them side-by-side only have time to show the
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:27.520]  US version it's almost identical the Mexican one in Spanish is almost
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:33.280]  identical same videos same production they don't tell you that under this
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:37.960]  agreement the Mexicans can come in here with it or the Canadians can come in
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:42.880]  here with it and now they're just going to say free open travel the UN SPP
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:49.160]  North American Union plan it's a free for all now if you have this car and then
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:52.680]  you can come in and once you have a baby here then you get all the welfare the
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:17:00.240]  anchor babies all of it now you tie that in with this next report CNN
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:03.840]  lavishes coffee party with favorable coverage after a year of tea party
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:08.120]  demonization two months ago I announced that if I have the time or that
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:11.920]  somebody else should do it we should start a coffee party stronger than tea
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:16.000]  to take over the tea parties that we started from the Republicans well the
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.440]  globalists are worse than that they now have an open Obama operative setting up
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:24.120]  the coffee party and every time I turn the TV on we've got it on in the coffee
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:27.720]  room I'm not even watching more than 20 minutes a day it's the tea party I
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:34.000]  mean the coffee party on there and then I watch videos from MSNBC and CNN we have
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.200]  these linked in the article that Watson wrote today at prison planet dot com the
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:41.880]  illegal aliens the ones you've seen by the millions protesting waving Mexican
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:46.680]  flags that's who's at these coffee parties so I knew this was coming and
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:52.480]  and said told my it guy you better get real coffee party dot com which we're
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:56.200]  launching tomorrow is it the real coffee party or real coffee party or we have
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:01.960]  both don't we the point is is that we've got to fend off the Republicans trying to
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:07.640]  take over the tea parties and and castrate them gelled them with a real
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:13.120]  code of constitutional systems and populism for freedom and we've got to
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:17.360]  fend off the Obama takeover because this the system wants to come in and take
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:23.240]  over the resistance to this globalist takeover so we're gonna get more into
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:27.880]  that but I want to play going out to break the hemispheric ID card ad that's
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:32.480]  been running for more than a year all over TV and they have a radio version of
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:36.760]  this as well so this is your North American Union ID card but under this
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:40.840]  bill you will need this to have a job and the Canadians and Mexicans can come
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:45.120]  here and we can go there vice versa and have jobs with this but of course it'll
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:49.240]  be selectively enforced only the u.s. is going to allow this Canada and Mexico
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:54.400]  never honor their agreements here it is from painted deserts set a place to
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:59.000]  snowcat mountain peaks our travels last for only days but our spirits soar for
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.800]  weeks the salty air a comfy chair a place we can't unwind but what it is we
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:10.360]  really miss is the home we left behind on June 1st 2009 new document
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:14.200]  requirements will make getting home from Canada Mexico and the Caribbean by
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:18.160]  land or sea more efficient learn more about the Western Hemisphere Travel
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:23.400]  Initiative and get you home dot go okay so what they do is they show you
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:28.520]  driver's license and then show them transform and turn if you look into
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:34.080]  North American travel passes and so they're saying in the bill we're gonna
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:37.360]  give these to all the illegal aliens because we've got to know what they're
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:43.560]  doing and just legalize them so this will fix illegal immigration because it
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:49.400]  will just make it all legal this is the UN plan this is what they're doing to
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:53.480]  Europe it's come out that in England and in Europe they have secret deals to let
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:57.000]  in unlimited legal aliens then they organize them into a political force to
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.200]  be used on the indigenous people the coffee party we all know that the

[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:09.240]  new film that seeks to do just that looking at the history of political
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:13.360]  power scandal and the vision of some of the most well-known leaders in the world
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:18.280]  and how they shaped it Jason Burmas is a radio host and filmmaker and is behind
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:21.760]  a new movie that we're talking about right now it's called the invisible
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:26.560]  empire a new world order defined hey there Jason I just checked out the
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:29.760]  trailer for your film and it looks like you've strung together a lot of
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:34.680]  historical footage many of it former US presidents talking about the need for a
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:40.240]  new world order talk about this concept and what it means to you well
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:46.240]  throughout history men of power have seeked to bring together the world
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:51.560]  under one government and they've called this the new world order whether it be
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:57.440]  Hitler during World War two or George Bush after the Gulf War they all seem
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:02.240]  to use this terminology so I decided to explore that and see what a new world
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:09.320]  order really was and try to define that term and what did you find well I found
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:13.440]  that through organizations such as the Council on Foreign Relations the Royal
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:17.600]  Institute for International Affairs the Trilateral Commission the Bilderberg
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:22.480]  Group and many others they have consolidated power on a mass level and
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:26.440]  are moving towards a world government you're seeing this more and more with
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:31.520]  events like the G20 calling for a world currency and SDR units as the new
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:35.880]  reserve currency so I'm really out to expose this agenda to not only the
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:40.240]  American people but the world I know I understand that you did also some work on
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:44.120]  the film loose change 9-11 which challenges what the authorities have
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:48.240]  said about 9-11 and identify some of the main points of what's now becoming the
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:55.160]  9-11 truth movement does the invisible empire deal with this issue at all well
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:59.760]  absolutely actually my last film fabled enemies expose the international
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:04.240]  intelligence organization surrounding 9-11 instead of focusing on the
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:09.240]  anomalies at the World Trade Center at WTC 7 or Shanksville we expose the Saudi
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:13.880]  Arabian the Pakistani the Israeli and shadow government connections and are
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:18.280]  now taking this a step further with invisible empire a new world order
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:22.080]  defined and this will be premiering at info wars.com and prisonplanet.tv
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:26.600]  April 15th for the world to see and as you just mentioned you're releasing it
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:31.680]  on info wars and prisonplanet did you try it all to get this released on the
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:35.720]  big screen or to get some investors to back you so it could become more well
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:40.680]  known by the public well to be honest with you I've tried to go that route
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:44.720]  before and it can be an extremely difficult process and with my films
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:48.840]  being seen by tens of millions of people online for free that gets the
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:52.840]  message out and we encourage people to take our films make copies and hand them
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:56.200]  out because this is not about money this is about getting the information to the
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:27:00.000]  public so that we can try to restore the Constitution and Bill of Rights in this
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.920]  country this is to oppose tyranny not to make a profit. I'm curious about invisible
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:09.720]  empire itself what give me some of the specifics the premise and what you hope
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:15.440]  your viewers will get out of it. Well a lot of times when people use the term
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:21.240]  New World Order you're already into the conspiracy arena and I literally have
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:26.640]  over 200 prominent people discussing that very term so I want to shatter the
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:32.200]  image of what a New World Order means and really put out the facts the truth
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:36.040]  about this agenda and that's what I've done in this film not only going over
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:40.320]  their organizations but also their modes of control such as assassination and
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:45.000]  false flag terror. You were contrasting I noticed especially in the trailer some
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:50.480]  of some leaders for example you had Hitler in there you also had you know
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:54.360]  President Kennedy President Bush talk a little bit about I mean you seem to be
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:28:00.200]  arguing that there's sort of a congruent message between these leaders. Well I
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:04.480]  don't think that I put Kennedy in a negative light Kennedy warned us that
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:09.720]  secret societies and backdoor dealings were a major problem during his
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:14.480]  presidency and we know where that led to his assassination so when we have a
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:19.640]  person like George Bush espousing a New World Order under the United Nations
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:23.880]  and global governance and then on the other side of the supposed spectrum we
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:27.440]  have people like Al Gore calling for the same exact thing and Bill Clinton
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:30.440]  calling for the same exact thing in this film you'll see Bill Clinton talk
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:34.520]  about a New World Order not once but twice so really I want to expose this
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:38.640]  like you said congruent agenda for world government. All right Jason Burma's
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:41.840]  thanks so much for giving us that inside look on your upcoming film comes out
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:58.840]  Invisible Empire comes out April 15th.
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:05.480]  I wanted to play Jason on RT yesterday doing a great job in the pre-buildup to
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:10.640]  the new film Invisible Empire a New World Order defined but I like the term
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:15.240]  they used the New World Order on trial in fact we're finishing the back cover
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:18.600]  right now the film is now officially done perhaps that should be the thing on
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:25.200]  the back a New World Order on trial as we've been debating the catchline on the
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:29.720]  back of the film or their greatest secrets revealed or the secrets you
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:34.240]  know secrets exposed I'm not sure but I wanted to play that Lieutenant Colonel
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:39.720]  Anthony Schaefer coming up and your phone calls and a lot more and we'll
[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:43.600]  continue to break down all the incredible news legislation now in the
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:47.760]  Congress to secretly arrest and torture American citizens for any reason the
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:56.440]  Pentagon wishes. We're on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:30:04.640]  GCN radio network. When you're out on the road the last place you want to be is
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:10.820]  on the road but if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing

[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:04.760]  others don't. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:09.520]  alone this is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:13.560]  this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:18.720]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:23.520]  are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:27.880]  citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:33.120]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:37.400]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:40.960]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:46.200]  checkout to. Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:51.160]  have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on

[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:09.280]  eloquence it is force like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:12.800]  America's government is no longer the servant of the people and the protector
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:16.440]  of our liberty but has become that fearful master. We the people must
[01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:19.360]  understand the nature of this government gone awry if we are to be
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:23.600]  successful in saving our country. America is being deliberately destroyed by a
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:27.320]  cabal of international gangsters so that she can be forced in the subjugation to
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:31.000]  a one world government. The God given unable rights of the Declaration of

[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:33.960]  were gonna do. Now Obama has launched a fake coffee party and we've analyzed it
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:38.080]  it's run by one of his former operatives. It's an illegal alien party and you
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:40.840]  talk about treason bringing illegal aliens in and then using them as a
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:45.440]  political weapon. This is amazing we're gonna be covering this more coming up in
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:50.320]  the rest of the broadcast but for the next 25 minutes Lieutenant Colonel Anthony

[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.000]  months is going to detail but it's going through the review process with the
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.240]  Pentagon. Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer is a Bronze Star recipient more

[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:45.600]  He instructs classes in psychology of terrorism and intelligence analyst and
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:49.960]  we're honored to have him on with us. Good to have you here.
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:35:00.440]  I want to recap your story get into the latest developments but you had set off
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:05.600]  air to me you saw my piece on Geraldo Saturday and I thought it's suspicious
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:09.480]  that within an hour and five minutes the media was already knowing this guy was
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:15.560]  supposedly a 9-11 truth or and I question why does the media love to
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:19.880]  demonize 9-11 truth and try to tie it in with violence when there never was any
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:23.840]  history of it they they pre-program people for that I mean I really see
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:28.720]  some type of of a setup here I think this whole thing is very suspicious well I
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:35.120]  think obviously there are people looking for rationale and reasons for actions
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:39.320]  that clearly are random in some cases I think you mentioned we talked about
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:44.960]  but there's coops out there who simply get well off the beaten path they adapt
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:49.080]  whatever you they think is closest to their their view of the world and I
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:55.320]  think in this case the individual just you know lost it and I'm the anti-terrorism
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:58.000]  officer of the division I'm in right now too and this is something the army is
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:04.120]  actually looking at is it's how individuals can become unstable and it's
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:07.960]  an issue which happens all across society I thought as a matter of fact Alex
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:11.560]  I think I recall hearing today somewhere else one of the individuals want
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:15.600]  bonkers and then start shooting people again in the workplace so you know to
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:20.240]  try to equivocate a coops attack on the Pentagon and lump it into it you know
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:24.400]  try to lump him into a larger organization simply doesn't make sense
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:27.400]  especially when you're talking about doing it within hours of the event I
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:30.520]  mean I both know to do a thorough investigation even do a triage
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:35.400]  investigation it would take days so you know for anyone to jump within hours
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:39.880]  and say this guy is associated you've got to wonder what the agenda is because
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:43.880]  clearly someone's not being objective and it's funny because if I'm gonna say
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:47.680]  this is probably politically correct if the guy was Muslim they would have taken
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:52.240]  hours and days to try to push away the fact that he was a Muslim descent
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:57.560]  because you know there's a complete opposite take if someone with a certain
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:01.760]  background for example the major has something it took him nearly five hours
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:07.240]  to disclose that he was at a a a a Middle Eastern night so there's a real
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:10.960]  problem with perception going on in the press right now and you know they're
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:14.960]  ready to jump one way but they will not jump another and this this to me tells
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:19.040]  that of the fact that there's a real problem with objective reporting so
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:23.200]  okay we'll take take the Fort Hood shooting it turned out in two years he
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:27.160]  was walking around praising suicide bombers he was communicating with these
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:32.280]  Al Qaeda operatives who are well known and the CIA has declared national security
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:37.560]  and won't give Congress those emails with the with the shooter at the Pentagon
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:42.760]  his family warned months before and weeks before about it nothing was done we
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:45.160]  have the underwear bomber I don't know if you're aware of this but it even came
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:49.280]  out in Detroit news the undersecretary of the State Department said we were
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:53.680]  ordered by an unnamed US intelligence agency sounds just like what happened to
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:59.800]  you and stratus ivy we were told to let him have his visa and help him get on
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:04.360]  the plane and we have the witnesses Kurt Haskell and others on the plane saying
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:09.320]  a sharp-dressed man without ID without passport got him through security in
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:13.840]  Amsterdam past the scanners onto the plane the FBI said that wasn't true at
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:19.520]  first now said okay it is true it looks like something more is going on I mean
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:25.000]  at bare minimum they're leaving the door open for these people well and this is
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.720]  there's a real risk versus gain and let me let me divert just a bit here but I
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:32.760]  think it's still on topic I believe the Bada Dara rest was something similar I
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:37.360]  think I think we were frankly getting a lot of intel take out of Bada Dara while
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:40.160]  he was still in and Bada Dara for those of your listeners that may be not
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:44.080]  understand we as he was a number two guy number two Taliban guy in Pakistan
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:49.480]  wrapped up in Karachi a while back just few weeks ago I'm hearing and I
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:54.200]  got this vote from British sources and American sources okay he was he was kind
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:58.480]  of neutralized where it was at he was being monitored and Alex that's one of
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:02.360]  the things we did that the tell us community does do they will target
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:05.920]  someone and let him sit they will know everything he's doing because the simple
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:10.200]  fact of their existence and their actions allows us to track back who they're
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:12.960]  talking to and again this goes back to able danger that's that was what we
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:16.680]  were doing we had a few known contacts we wanted them to exist we wanted to see
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:19.920]  who they were talking to and figure out what the cells were and it's all linked
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:24.280]  together it's one big happy family to social network so I think when you look
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:29.040]  at the the underwear bomber that it is very possible they were allowing him to
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:32.240]  do something and they may have thought this was a dry run no they've now said
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:35.400]  that they've now admitted the State Department's admitted that yeah frankly
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:39.720]  that that we know that that the Al Qaeda and then call it especially when they're
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:44.040]  doing a major attack will do rehearsals James Wood the actor James Wood actually
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:47.240]  witnessed one of the rehearsals when he flew out of Boston right before not
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:50.400]  alive and he actually reported to the FBI and it kind of blew him off so so
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:53.240]  frankly you know that may have been what's been going on here but doesn't
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:56.920]  make it right because clearly the pieces were all there their indication this
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:01.200]  guy had been radicalized he was been trained and and and going towards the
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:06.480]  idea of Bottadar I think Bottadar was was not arrested because we wanted to
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:08.960]  get more intelligence out of him I think in some ways he was arrested and
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:11.720]  neutralized him because one of the things we have to remember Alex is
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:17.360]  Bottadar was the main contact between the Taliban and the Pakistani ISI so
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:21.400]  you know I think the last thing in the world the Pakistani ISI wants is a
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:26.520]  Taliban guy talking about who and the ISI the Pakistani ISI is bad so you know
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:30.360]  I preach this on the air every time I go on you've got to look deeper in the
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:33.880]  story you cannot take things at face value because there's always more and
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:37.760]  frankly there's there's multiple competing agendas and it's very tough
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:42.120]  as you know to get past the agendas and get to the truth well let me expand on
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:47.320]  that because we know about the airlift of evil here's the MSNBC article why
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:51.960]  did we let Pakistan pull volunteers out of Kunduz and over and over again
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:56.120]  special forces commanders would capture top Taliban al-Qaeda and thousands of
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:41:00.960]  fighters they were ordered let them go send them to Pakistan and we know time
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:05.360]  and time again it's like this Adam Gadan thing they say Pakistan captured him
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:09.440]  and then we hear oh no he wasn't captured you know was he pulled in you
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:13.520]  know he's the he's the he's the grandson one of the ADL founders the super
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:17.920]  anti-muslim guy that now he's the voice of al-Qaeda I mean give me a break we
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:21.360]  know there's all these double and triple agents out there so we hear somebody
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:25.760]  gets captured over and over again and we know about these airlifts of evil well
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:29.840]  what's your take on that well I think you have to talk I mean that's one of the
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:34.080]  issues we have to look at here is what is what is the real story and let's let's
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:38.840]  talk about the Gadan thing or Pakistan in general frankly one of the things that
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:42.520]  that's been seen several times lately is the Pakistan he's trying to maintain
[01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:49.040]  control of the Taliban and and and in many ways they see the Taliban as as I
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:55.800]  ran sees his mama they do I do it as a separate but capable component of their
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:42:00.800]  their national strength therefore when you start looking at what how it works
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:04.680]  who's involved you really got a question what their motives are what the
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:07.880]  Pakistani motives aren't when they do anything and to underscore your point
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:13.000]  absolutely what back in 03 was one of the first indicators that we knew and I
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.480]  briefed in all of our other commander forces on it that Taliban ISI elements
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:22.280]  were not only participating they were captured there was an ISI female
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:28.480]  operative captured in a Taliban raid in Afghanistan in 03 so you know we have
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:31.600]  indicators going back to 03 that they've been riding both sides of the
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:36.200]  rail and in this case we really got a look at at how they're doing it now one
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:42.560]  of our senior fellows Chris Mason came out recently and and and foreign affairs
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:46.480]  its publication and talked about the fact that he thinks that all everything
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:50.080]  we're seeing right now is being orchestrated by the Pakistanis not
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:54.160]  because they support us but they're working on out of their own enlightened
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:58.800]  self-interest to reinvigorate themselves into into the negotiations with us
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:02.800]  in the Taliban because they know if the Taliban breaks off you know from them
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:06.920]  and and direct negotiates with us that the Taliban that the Pakistanis lose
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:10.560]  and lose control so I think you need to look at everything that goes on here as
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:15.080]  a big chessboard and figure out that sometimes sacrificing upon is a good
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:19.720]  thing if that means you can protect your your your your queen and I think that's
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:23.440]  what we're doing here that was going on here every time a move is made you got
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:26.560]  to look at that the chessboard and figure out okay what's going on over
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:29.880]  here on the other side of the chessboard what did we not see and and for
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:36.680]  example the Marja campaign you know again we that's been something it's been
[01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:40.040]  going on for a while we have yet to understand what if any effect that's
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:44.760]  going to have a long-term winning of the war if you know and winning again I
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:47.760]  think you know I talked about it so we have to redefine our definition of
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:51.280]  victory and winning so you know we've got to look at this we got a look at
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:56.200]  Pakistan and Afghanistan as a whole and we cannot win Afghanistan whatever
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:00.880]  measure whatever definition you use to define winning or victory we cannot win
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:04.760]  in Afghanistan unless we went in Pakistan and right now I think the
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:07.640]  picture is too muddled to make a good judgment if we're making progress in
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:14.000]  Pakistan or not well let's expand on that though you go back to 1993 it came
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.440]  out the New York Times and CBS News and we now have the FBI tapes that were
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:22.560]  declassified last year that were in the trial the FBI goes in hires Ahmad
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:26.520]  Salam an Egyptian intelligence officer tells them we're going to set up local
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:31.760]  Muslim radicals both guys were borderline morons they cook the bomb they
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:34.880]  train the driver and then they say we're not going to do the sting we're going to
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:39.000]  let it go ahead Ahmad Salam starts recording them telling him that they're
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.160]  you know that yes you were hired you were told to build a dummy bomb then we
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:46.400]  change it to real bomb now we're letting it go ahead clearly as a way to get more
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:51.320]  funding crack down a police state we have the Homeland Security my report
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:54.760]  documents that came out last year were most of Homeland Security is now for
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:59.240]  gun owners veterans libertarians conservatives this whole anti-terror
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:04.320]  apparatus is really being used as a cashless society taxing and control
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:10.000]  grid we have civil edmund saying now until the day of 9-11 that the u.s.
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:14.920]  elements of it involved with the Turks and involved with the Pakistanis and
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:23.040]  CIA and Mossad and and British MI 6 were all in her words running al-Qaeda or
[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:29.320]  elements of it on the day of 9-11 and she's gagged now a is she a liar in your
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:33.560]  view or why is she saying this because the evidence backs are up I mean who are
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:37.440]  the players because I look at this from a Hegelian dialectic of problem reaction
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:42.440]  solution or from some of the army field manuals that talk about false flag to
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:47.800]  to to again allow this to happen bare minimum as a pretext to launch new
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:51.920]  wars well let me let me cover the question kind of two parts first off I
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:55.480]  know some better I respect her I think she's a wonderful woman and I admire
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:46:02.080]  work I do too she she is she's she's very well spoken and I look I gotta tell
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:04.680]  you I'm always been far boys been fascinated about the fact they've been
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:08.760]  trying to gag her I mean to me it's loony you know the more they try to
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:14.240]  shut her up the more and more credibility giver so I think I give her
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:17.280]  that right there's like man the more they try to sit on yet you know all the
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:22.160]  FBI agents that were gagged who tried to stop it well and then there's some of
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:26.080]  other associates I know one of them was on the FAA red team and you know there
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:29.480]  was a recent thing on Facebook I was watching kind of just go where
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:32.960]  Condoleezza Rice talked about no one could imagine air you know aircraft
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:37.040]  being used as weapons well Alex the FAA was trained against that scenario for
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:40.760]  years before 9-11 so so so and that's all you know again what one of the
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:46.320]  Pentagon ran a drill the year before of it happening right so so I think you
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:50.600]  know this is one of those things where I think everybody can speculate all day
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:56.120]  and I think Sibel has given some extraordinarily clear clues to follow
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:47:01.840]  up the problem is always to get someone to investigate and this is one of the
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:05.760]  things I've talked about both with my issue with the 9-11 issue with some of
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:09.800]  other things you there's got to be a way of establishing a credible
[01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:13.640]  investigative body to sort through this because otherwise and this is what I
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:18.200]  think I do take exception with the Obama administration talking about trying to
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:22.000]  go after radical groups you know frankly I think by the fact you won't
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.520]  address the fundamental underlying issues that people are upset about that
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:30.640]  that directly influences the number of people who get frustrated and become
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:35.160]  radicalized who want what action so let's stop there let's stop there run out of
[01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:38.720]  time and this is so important for people that don't know your case maybe
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:42.560]  crystallize that in a I mean how you were stopped from doing your job and
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:47.560]  stopping 9-11 and then at every point the doors were opened the embassies gave
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:51.800]  them their their visas and we're and we're told this is part of national
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:56.200]  security they work for us you have Ada and others popping up at US military
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:03.400]  bases I mean this this stinks to high heaven but but pulling back from that we
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:07.800]  have this overall demonization of anybody who calls for a new investigation
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:11.600]  and you have Debra Medina getting in trouble for it a gubernatorial candidate
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:15.320]  you have all these talk show hosts saying you're the devil if you question
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:20.600]  anything in or around 9-11 we have six of the 10 9-11 commissioners coming out
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:24.960]  and saying we need a new investigation go ahead and I think that's that's right
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:28.600]  there should be the beginning and end of it if the 9-11 commissioners themselves
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:32.000]  and I heard heard this other than the new state talking about something you know
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  there there's apparently a belief now by them that a lot of them I don't love
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.640]  the commissioners that let that that the report is speculative at best so if
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:41.880]  if you're if you're putting out speculation as policy then there's
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:45.320]  something that's really wrong I mean come on Alex that's what is wrong so I
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:48.120]  think that should be the beginning and end of it right there that should be the
[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:51.560]  place where everything starts and ends regarding the justification for a new
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:55.760]  investigation so it's not wrong to call for an investigation not at all and
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:58.680]  especially since the investigators themselves that the commissioners have
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:02.200]  said that you know we didn't go as far as we probably could or should have now
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:05.280]  with that said I think you know what you want to talk about able danger and
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:08.760]  there's there's a book out and it's one of those things I rail at when people
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:12.200]  say well you know the IG report to send the other about able danger the IG
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:16.920]  report talks about the fact that that our name was found in a database as well
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:19.800]  and people don't bother to read the report they read the summary and say
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:22.280]  there's no evidence but they don't bother to read the body where they say well
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:26.640]  yeah we actually did find a top name it was an army database so so hell is
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:29.440]  wrong people say well you know the able danger report if you did what shape or
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:33.840]  say no I did did the opposite it's just people never covered it and I cite for
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:37.160]  you Alex something that everybody can pick up they can go to Amazon pick it up
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:40.760]  right now it's and I don't have any investment I know I don't know the guy
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:45.200]  wrote it Doug Stanton wrote a book called horse soldiers and on page 24 of that
[01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:48.400]  book and your your your listeners can go look at it right now go on Amazon
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:54.120]  there's a vision about Jeffrey Lambert Major General Jeffrey Lambert who
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:57.960]  was the operations officers at Socom when I was why was involved with able
[01:49:57.960 --> 01:50:02.880]  danger Major Major General Lambert admits on the day of not 11 his thinking
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:07.920]  was oh my god you know I know who did this it was al-Qaeda and I know the guy
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:11.680]  who did it I know it Todd because I was briefed on him a year before and that's
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:17.320]  in the book so you know you got to ask yourself how I was at the duty IG failed
[01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:21.960]  to interview Major General Jeffrey Lambert and now here he is years later the
[01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:26.600]  book came out I guess January of last year how is it now he's admitting this
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:31.000]  and I you know did they not get the memory keep his mouth shut did they just
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:35.800]  not get contacted by the IG so with that fact alone Alex I think that justifies
[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:40.200]  a new investigation of able danger I would you would not agree with me on that
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:45.160]  absolutely okay so you've got a major figure able danger now admitting yeah
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:50.240]  we knew about a time it was part of the special project doing data mining so so
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:54.160]  this is also to me this is patently obvious that someone either missed a
[01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:58.280]  clue or in my judgment they purposely avoided getting the clue I mean what
[01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:01.480]  if you're not gonna hop for zebras in the Antarctic and that's what they were
[01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:04.840]  doing on the able danger investigation anywhere we told them a look they'd look
[01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:08.680]  somewhere else or change the question so if they did that with my issue Alex
[01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:13.760]  what have they done in other areas did you got to ask that question well I mean
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:18.240]  at a certain point you it's clear that this is not just screw-ups and you've
[01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:22.840]  chalked some of it up to turf battles they want the CIA wanted its own private
[01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:27.840]  merc armies blackwater and others they didn't want the army shining they wanted
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:31.320]  to move to this more mercenary model but it's more than that I mean they got
[01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:35.840]  their police state they got their new wars they got their naked body scanners
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:40.120]  they got their Patriot Act which they now use against the general public they've
[01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:45.800]  now got bills introduced the centers to be detained as enemy belligerence US
[01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:51.120]  citizens I have the bill here it's just for any intelligence gathering or such
[01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:55.120]  other matters as the president considers appropriate I mean they're
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:52:00.360]  killing America on the altar of the Al Qaeda boogeyman when this thing grew out
[01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:06.680]  of what the CIA set up in 1979 to the 1980s in the Mujahideen and it's just
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:11.560]  every door open to the terrorist every door they're protected I mean bottom line
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:16.400]  here this looks like a staged event to me then we can debate well how much of
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:20.360]  it staged or to what extent well I think Alex your listeners need to take a hard
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:23.480]  look at what's going on and they need to pop the pressure the representatives
[01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:27.640]  because this is the one question I would ask you to think about if we've done and
[01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:30.040]  as you said these things are not new these have been in the process of being
[01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:33.040]  implemented people have had time to use to him the law enforcement intelligence
[01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:37.360]  community has these tools available to him how is it then the underwear bomber
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:42.960]  got so close to launching as my fact had he not technically failed to ignite the
[01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:47.280]  weapon it would have been a touchdown so you got to ask yourself with all these
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:52.080]  new laws how is it we we had a near miss how is it I mean think about it the
[01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:55.280]  intelligence guy to me he's got everything it can and and and for
[01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:59.720]  example Mr. Rudin the the the special advisor to the president regarding
[01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:05.200]  terrorism he talks about 20% revisionism is being okay and now the number two guy
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:08.280]  and tell about it and it's all about it and Pakistan picked up what part of the
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:12.080]  left off is one of the guys who released from Guantanamo so it's 20%
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:17.440]  revisionism okay so you know what what it you've got to ask yourself what are we
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:21.200]  doing as a government with these enhanced laws with these enhanced over
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:25.080]  with these enhanced abilities of the intelligence community because to me if
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:28.680]  you're having your misses after all these enhancements something's wrong and
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:32.960]  and you got it again what you know if you've been given everything you want
[01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:36.640]  and you still aren't producing that means like you pointed out somewhere we
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:40.240]  missed something in the early investigations I argue the 9-11 Commission
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:43.720]  not only got it wrong they didn't get to the number what was really wrong at all
[01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:48.000]  and this is where I think all you know we've got to go back to that fundamental
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.520]  beginning they did not 11 attacks to look at that and then make an assessment
[01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:55.840]  what actually went wrong because they never placed blame and I think Alex
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:54:00.080]  they need to go back and place blame and frankly I'm do some of that blame
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:03.200]  because I didn't scream as much as I should have regarding the fact we
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:06.560]  identify these guys and we're trying to get the FBI the information I just
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:09.720]  a part of that fact that I feel horrible about the fact that I was not you
[01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:13.400]  know out of all the things I've made you know decisions about my life that was
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:16.840]  not Colonel Schaefer you at least tried to stop it I don't think you have any
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:21.600]  blame here instead we saw the FBI commanders that blocked their agents
[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:25.160]  from stopping people at the flight schools when they specifically said we
[01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:29.520]  believe they're training in Arizona Minnesota Oklahoma to fly planes in the
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:34.120]  buildings the people they got demoted and the agents that block them got
[01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:39.520]  record cash bonuses here's Detroit news calm terror suspect kept visa to avoid
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:43.880]  tipping off larger investigation so we know they were tracking him we know his
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:48.680]  father warned them we know all this was going on I mean this is just
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:54.600]  absolutely staged out in the open and we know that this threat of terror is
[01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:59.880]  being used to clamp down on the American people and so you are calling for a new
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:03.960]  9-11 investigation here and that's good I mean who would investigate it because
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:09.560]  it's the same corrupt politicians every time that have a incentive to want to
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:13.160]  cover up what the system's done in the past I mean who investigates at state
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:17.560]  grand juries who well I think you've got to find someone of someone getting out
[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:21.720]  of the politics and doing it I frankly the 9-11 Commission was made up of
[01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:26.920]  people who all had background and agendas almost you know contrary to the
[01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:29.880]  good interest of the country trying to get to the bottom so you gotta find
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:33.560]  people who have two things first off the skill set to understand what they're
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:37.320]  looking at I heard you have to not 11 staff did not understand the importance
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:39.880]  of certain things that were brought to them and I would cite able dangers one
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:44.200]  secondly you gotta have people who do not have political agendas and it's
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:48.280]  it's frankly it's hard to find but not impossible this is one of those things if
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:52.680]  there is a will to have someone allow a selection process to go to a vetting
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:56.680]  process to go through you could find the right people I mean you could find
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:56:00.840]  people who would do a credible job of telling the truth and but that process
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:04.920]  itself would be painful it probably take about you know probably a year to get
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:10.040]  the right people selected but simply because it's tough to do it there's
[01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:14.040]  no reason to not do it anything so we need the people to continue investigating
[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:18.520]  and lawsuits and other things in closing uh colonel shaffer we appreciate your
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:22.040]  time here in your courage to come on and talk about these issues
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:27.320]  um they're vetting your book right now in national security it's coming out I
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:31.320]  guess in the next few months hopefully the day is 31 august we get the
[01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:34.680]  public day is 31 august okay so so coming up in
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:37.480]  august we'll have you back then we appreciate your time
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:40.920]  how much are they gonna allow you to put in there that the public
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:45.320]  hasn't known so far can give us any tidbits of stuff that's been vetted and
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:49.080]  that you're allowed to release well I guess the one thing I can
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:52.680]  talk about in good details the fact that the there's an entire chapter devoted
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:55.880]  to my initial conversations with philip zelacow
[01:56:55.880 --> 01:56:59.720]  at bobram this is not something I was able to go into for any number of
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:04.280]  reasons when I testified and I pretty much go through the entire
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:09.000]  you know verbatim what happened and so you know it is for my recollection you
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.160]  have to remember that uh and I go through and provide the detail the other
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:15.720]  thing I think is going to be notable about the book because it was you know
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:19.640]  it wasn't just me talking uh we had collaboration and and and support
[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:22.600]  from other members who were deployed with me so when you read the book
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:26.440]  you have to understand it's been better not only by you know a security review
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:29.400]  but the folks who are actually there with me have participated in helping
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:32.920]  write the book so and we're gonna get a bird's eye view
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:37.640]  into how you were specifically blocked from taking out al-qaeda before the
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:41.240]  attacks well don't forget this is only the introduction of able danger not to
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:43.880]  not to be it is not going to be a teaser but
[01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:47.880]  this covers my uh deployment to afghanistan in o3 and o4
[01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:51.080]  and where the disclosure may have basically basically the the thing that
[01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:55.240]  came after an o5 and o6 is an entirely different story but this actually
[01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:59.240]  talks about in great detail my protected disclosure to philip zelacow
[01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:02.680]  and what happened to me when they tried to shut me up and that covers the
[01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:06.360]  stratoscivy correct and what touches upon that a little bit as
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:10.360]  by fact um stratoscivy is brought up in greater details right back it's one of
[01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:12.520]  the new things a little bit more detail on stratoscivy
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:15.400]  that looks like they'll be able to uh to read about what in the book
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:19.080]  but bottom line colonel shaffer the establishment gets more power out of
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:22.920]  these terror attacks and i find that very suspicious
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:26.360]  i find it uh the the fact that we've given the intelligence community a lot more
[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:28.920]  authority a lot more money a lot more resources and we're still having problems
[01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:32.920]  to be uh something terribly wrong and again you
[01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:36.760]  your your listeners should really question where is the money going and
[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:39.240]  what are we spending it for because they're getting a lot of money
[01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:46.840]  colonel shaffer thank you thank you for listening to gcn be sure to visit gcn

[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:08.200]  the big issue here and i know you as listeners know this but our mission
[02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:12.840]  is to get this out to the general public
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:17.080]  that there is a world government there's no longer any denial it is run by the
[02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:19.720]  banks like all the old timers warned us it was
[02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:23.080]  it's been in control for a long time now it's out in the open
[02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:27.640]  because it's really starting to clamp down on every facet of our lives
[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:34.360]  like this article i have here uh in my stack i'm looking for it i meant to get
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:41.320]  to it i mentioned it earlier um from of all places
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:46.760]  uh this is from ESPN and we actually covered this months ago but now it's
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:49.880]  getting attention because it's on ESPN and that's good news
[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:53.400]  that under the law the sea treaty and separate environmental rules they're
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:56.440]  trying to pass because Obama can't get that ratified
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:59.800]  they're talking about seizing all inland waterways
[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:04.600]  lakes pond streams standing water
[02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:08.840]  it's worse than the wetlands act we saw 15 years ago that failed
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:12.040]  where if you had a rainwater the feds could come in and not let you use your
[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:16.760]  land or build on it this is even below water
[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:20.040]  they have this new fake clean water act they're trying to
[02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:24.360]  ram through and
[02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:28.840]  it's so diabolical they want control of every facet of your life
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:31.720]  and so they tell you oh we're taking your land we're taking your property
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:35.000]  we're raising taxes on you to save the earth and you're going to pay your
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:39.160]  taxes these private banks it's it's it's totally transparent open world
[02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:42.840]  dictatorship being set up by private banks in everyone's
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:46.440]  face and guys i can't find it will you reprint me

[02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:56.440]  uh the espn article about fishing fishing to be banned they can't go

[02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:03.720]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:07.720]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily

[02:05:23.720 --> 02:05:27.400]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:31.320]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:34.440]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:38.360]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator

[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:09.000]  out by robert mott gumry i want to get him on
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.760]  and it says uh when the world wildlife fund a bunch of eugenicists an
[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:16.520]  international fund for animal welfare completed their successful campaign in
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:19.720]  ontaria they were able to ban many types of hunting
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:22.840]  and now they're saying it's it's a mean to fish
[02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:25.720]  now there's big trawlers out there in the in the gulf of mexico and the
[02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:28.920]  atlantic and pacific that are overfishing there are some problems this is

[02:09:39.640 --> 02:09:43.960]  and the administration planning the future of recreational fishing access to
[02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:47.560]  america based on a similar agenda of the same groups and other
[02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:51.640]  big green anti-use organizations as they can train you what type of light bulb
[02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:54.680]  you can have what type of toilet what type of car they can do anything home
[02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:59.160]  inspections through an executive order by president obama
[02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:02.120]  the current us direction of fishing is direct parallel to what happened in
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:05.400]  canada with hunting the negative economic impacts on hardworking american
[02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:08.440]  families and small businesses are being ignored

[02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:33.000]  most u.s. lakes are full of fish and they can always be restocked
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:36.360]  but this is about total control federal licensing
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:39.880]  to be able to fish this is about domesticating us
[02:10:39.880 --> 02:10:46.120]  and getting full control over our lives okay shifting gears now

[02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:01.400]  and i just finished reading a thick encyclopedic level book
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:05.880]  a dark history of the vatican and some of the things that went on there now
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:09.720]  this is not a catholic bashing fest and there have been plenty of atrocities
[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:13.320]  by protestants in europe as well but it's important to understand what's
[02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:16.200]  happened to religion in our culture and why the vatican today
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:21.080]  is calling for world government and again i'm not a catholic but i'm not
[02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:23.640]  here bashing catholics we've got pat robertson saying
[02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:27.800]  forced abortion in china is good and socialism is of god nub obama
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:31.640]  we have the clergy response teams today tens of thousands of preachers recruited
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:35.640]  to tell their flocks roman's 13 submit to government turn your guns in take
[02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:38.920]  shots go to femacamps when you're told we broke that four years ago
[02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:42.040]  here on genesis the pastor butch paul with the secret documents and now it's
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:44.520]  mainstream news but we're going to get in
[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:47.880]  to this today because i lamp in the dark is
[02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:54.360]  stunning in formation so we now go to writer director christian j pentob
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:57.480]  produce the award-winning documentaries that we just mentioned
[02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:01.240]  and it's he joins us today christ thanks for coming on
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:05.640]  hey alexis good to talk to you again so much is happening
[02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:09.880]  again i'm intrigued because i know it all ties together and it but but
[02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:15.080]  how does this film uh really getting into the early church and through the
[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:18.520]  middle ages and persecution by the vatican and others
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:22.360]  because then the illuminati group at least it at its inception was claiming
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:26.120]  it was anti-vatican so how do these groups
[02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:30.680]  dovetail together well i think they dovetail because the whole concept of a
[02:13:30.680 --> 02:13:35.400]  new world order uh is really rom's original concept
[02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:42.200]  you can you can trace it back to 1494 when pope alexander
[02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:46.760]  of the six drew a line literally drew a line down the center of the world map
[02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:49.880]  gave half the world to spain and the other half to portugal
[02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:54.120]  and told him to go out and conquer everything um uh the
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:58.760]  the the claims of the papacy for more than a thousand years
[02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:02.120]  have been that the pope holds the place of christ
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:05.880]  and god upon the earth and so he has the power
[02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:10.920]  that has the power uh over the world overall kings and princes and rulers
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:14.840]  and governors and so on they're all supposed to submit to his authority
[02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:19.080]  whether they know about him or not uh some people might remember the film
[02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:24.440]  years ago with richard chamberlain uh showgun the big long six hour series
[02:14:24.440 --> 02:14:27.960]  uh it was based on a book by james clavell well at one point
[02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:31.960]  you know the storyline basically is it's this english sailor
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:36.840]  who's stranded on the isle of japan and he learns the ways of their culture and
[02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:40.440]  so on and uh there's all of these jesuit priests
[02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:45.320]  that are there in japan and they're working of course to try and take over
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:49.160]  uh the uh you know the show guns and their empire and so on there in japan
[02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:53.160]  but the show guns don't realize that and richard chamberlain at one point is
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:56.440]  trying to warn them about what these guys are doing
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:15:02.360]  and uh he informs them at some point that the pope had given their land
[02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:07.160]  uh over to the portugese and they're looking at him and say well this is
[02:15:07.160 --> 02:15:09.880]  not possible how is this possible and so on
[02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:13.880]  of course they had no idea that that the the papacy in the vatican have made
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:16.200]  these claims percentage and they had the portugese
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:19.320]  rudders that was the big secret was that the vatican
[02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:23.240]  had the good maps of the seaways that nobody else had globally
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:27.080]  right and from what i understand the jesuits actually counterfeited some of
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:30.600]  the maps and showed them to the to the joke to the
[02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:34.840]  show guns uh to deceive them about the land masses and the waterways and all
[02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:37.800]  that kind of stuff well let's fast forward for a moment
[02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:41.080]  in my research for in-game blueprint for global enslavement
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:45.960]  we discovered that the belterberg group uh with some key people from the vatican
[02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:52.440]  uh actually in the early uh fifties and this has now been declassified
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:57.000]  that they had the idea for the european union and that was the treaty of rome
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:00.600]  uh then that was expanded in nineteen uh
[02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:04.760]  fifty seven when they officially really started setting up the european union
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:09.000]  and and and that's why a few years ago they had the fiftieth anniversary
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:15.400]  in 2007 of the eu when the eu wasn't officially set up until 2000
[02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:21.480]  yeah the eu is said to be a total it is said to be a total vatican project by
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:25.480]  um oh in the book the power and the principality of europe
[02:16:25.480 --> 02:16:29.560]  uh that was set forth by uh an english conservative party member
[02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:35.320]  uh anthony um um oh i can't remember his last name but
[02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:39.240]  why did the vatican then go after the tempers
[02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:43.720]  that's a that's an interesting that is really said to be the Templars the
[02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:47.320]  suffering of the Templars was said to be more through the king of france at least
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:52.440]  from what i've studied of it uh and the Templars were bringing in this is in the
[02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:56.120]  the 1200s now they had been over in the middle east
[02:16:56.120 --> 02:17:01.400]  they were in jerusalem they're dealing with uh these different groups like the
[02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:04.280]  yet cd they're dealing with the muslims and the jews and so on
[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:08.440]  and they were creating a kind of amalgamated religious system
[02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:11.720]  where they were blending in all of these different world religions
[02:17:11.720 --> 02:17:15.800]  and that's a key that's kind of part of you know a lot of the research that i do
[02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:20.680]  is uh showing uh how the new world order that the way that they're trying to
[02:17:20.680 --> 02:17:25.160]  unite the nations is by breaking down all the boundaries that separate men
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:29.000]  world politics is one of them but world religion is another
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:32.360]  and we see the u n pushing this morning strong pushing it
[02:17:32.360 --> 02:17:35.800]  but separately we see the last couple popes
[02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:39.800]  getting up and having these big conclaves of all the religious leaders
[02:17:39.800 --> 02:17:45.240]  there in vatican city praying together right as they did back in 1986 and
[02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:49.480]  then again uh after the year 2000 and then the united nations of course
[02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:53.240]  having their big um millennium summit where they get all the different
[02:17:53.240 --> 02:17:56.680]  leaders of the world religions you know who claim that they're all praying to
[02:17:56.680 --> 02:18:01.480]  the same god uh but that's all part of this uh part of this move to
[02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:06.440]  create a one world religion or what a a world religious belief system
[02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:10.840]  that will go hand in glove with a world political system but from the beginning
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:14.680]  rome was using christianity as a political tool once christians
[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:19.000]  were able to uh uh become dominant so i'm gonna try to
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:22.440]  shut up now we're about to go to break but let's let's go through the chronological
[02:18:22.440 --> 02:18:25.400]  order uh of what the film covers because it's key
[02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:30.120]  information well we try to cover we we do this through the history of the bible
[02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:34.360]  starting in the first century showing how the gospels were set forth
[02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:37.960]  and then how there are a lot of warnings i mean of course i'm a christian
[02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:41.000]  so you know i believe uh the teachings of the bible
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:45.080]  and we show how jesus and all of the apostles had warned of
[02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:48.040]  grievous wolves that would enter into the church
[02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:52.920]  and that would misuse the christian faith for their own selfish designs
[02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:57.160]  uh and so those warnings begin and then we move up forward
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:02.520]  uh into the early centuries and uh ultimately the conflict really in
[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:07.720]  rome between christianity and paganism and that conflict came to or what
[02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:12.600]  seemed like it came to an end with constantine the great in 313 ad
[02:19:12.600 --> 02:19:15.800]  and constantine was the you know the famous general
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:19.640]  rome was a tetrarchy was governed by four emperors
[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:24.840]  and then constantine sees this vision where he sees a supposedly a cross
[02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:28.600]  emblazoned on the sun and he hears a voice tell him
[02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:33.640]  in this sign conquer and so he then adopts the sign of the cross
[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:38.840]  uh he believes the vision is from christos or christ uh and he and uses
[02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:41.560]  this symbol goes into battle defeats his enemies
[02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:45.240]  and rome becomes a a single system under a single emperor
[02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:49.560]  all right stay there we're coming back we're gonna roll through this history
[02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:55.560]  uh with chris pinto the new film the fourth in the series a lamp in the dark

[02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:20.600]  wisdom being lost with time the government we once entrusted to protect
[02:22:20.600 --> 02:22:24.680]  from counterfeit has colluded with private business creating the largest fiat

[02:22:27.720 --> 02:22:31.560]  this is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable
[02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:35.240]  to our elected government but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90
[02:22:35.240 --> 02:22:38.440]  cents of its original value now foreign governments are trying to

[02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:06.920]  okay let's go right back to chris pinto so you were getting into
[02:24:06.920 --> 02:24:11.960]  constantine right before the fall the roman empire 100 years later continue
[02:24:11.960 --> 02:24:16.600]  constantine was the first to to legalize christianity there in rome
[02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:22.440]  with the edict of malon in 313 ap so he legalizes christianity and then
[02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:29.160]  christianity is over time merged with the pagan ideas or the pagan
[02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:34.200]  belief system of rome and constantine it it said if you read different
[02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:38.120]  historians that he confused christos with the god
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:41.720]  mithras okay the sun god of the ancient world
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:45.640]  and there are some uh like when you see these big statues of
[02:24:45.640 --> 02:24:49.640]  constantine there's a very famous head and his arm and leg and this kind of
[02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:53.960]  thing these were gigantic statues that he had set up around his empire
[02:24:53.960 --> 02:24:58.360]  with him dressed up like saul and victor the sun god
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:01.800]  okay and he believed he was the manifestation of saul and victor
[02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:06.840]  well i said that constantine took uh to himself as caesar he became the sole
[02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:11.080]  emperor of rome he had the title pontifex maximus
[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:14.680]  that's the title for the caesar that was that meant he was the head of the
[02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:17.960]  pontifical college the head of the pagan priesthood
[02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:22.280]  so he adopted another title as the head of the christian church
[02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:27.240]  and he called himself vicarious christi meaning another christ or the
[02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:31.240]  substitute for christ uh one who stands in the place of christ
[02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:34.920]  and so he would govern the pagans and he would govern the christians with these
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:38.280]  two titles uh and then in time of course he you know he
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:41.160]  leaves rome because of all the politics involved
[02:25:41.160 --> 02:25:45.960]  he goes and he founds constantinople uh and then rome falls to the barbarian
[02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:48.760]  tribes and this kind of thing and in the aftermath
[02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:53.320]  the the popes arise as the bishops of rome
[02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:57.800]  and they claim these two titles of constantin the vicar of christ vicarious
[02:25:57.800 --> 02:26:01.720]  christi and pontifex maximus which they hold to this day
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:07.720]  that's why the pope is called the pontif um but anyway uh so then from there
[02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:12.120]  this system now you know because constantine had set forth
[02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:17.560]  the edict against heretics and so now heretics before if you read the new
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:21.240]  testament if somebody's guilty of heresy you know they would ask them to
[02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:25.640]  depart from the church or as in the case of you know when
[02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:28.360]  the apostle paul is at the school of tyrannous
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:31.800]  he just separates the disciples from the unbelievers
[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:35.080]  you know they would separate themselves from people who disagreed
[02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:38.600]  uh but now constantine you know the state steps in
[02:26:38.600 --> 02:26:43.720]  and constantine is passing laws that people who disagree on certain doctrinal
[02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:48.040]  issues have to be hunted down arrested in some
[02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:52.040]  cases killed and so on for heresy and if you you
[02:26:52.040 --> 02:26:56.520]  can to this day go online and read constantine's different writings against
[02:26:56.520 --> 02:27:00.040]  the heretics and uh it you know is very aggressive
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:03.240]  you know you can see the violence in his words
[02:27:03.240 --> 02:27:07.240]  uh and there are some who believe that that was really the beginning of what
[02:27:07.240 --> 02:27:12.120]  would become the dark ages uh when the the roman church
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:16.440]  now would begin to persecute everyone who disagreed with the official
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:21.720]  state doctrine and so on um and so we we take it up but what we
[02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:26.280]  show is that with the formation of the roman catholic system
[02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:31.160]  there were still believers bible believers who were never a part of the roman
[02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:35.880]  system and uh we from the histories that we have
[02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:40.200]  many of these groups fled into the north of italy and the south of france
[02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:43.800]  and they became known as the paulicans they were known as the
[02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:48.600]  the donatist in some cases the walled ends as the albogences they've
[02:27:48.600 --> 02:27:53.480]  been given different names um but probably the walled ends is in the
[02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:57.560]  albogences of the two most famous and from reading the history from the
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:00.760]  beginning the the the so-called christian roman
[02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:05.400]  emperors they would particularly persecute other christian sex
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:09.240]  that they didn't control and and and ignore the pagans but then later they
[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:11.800]  started going after everybody or how did that work
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:15.480]  that's how it just what you said is what seems to have happened uh
[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:19.480]  mainly the inquisitions began we kind of fast forward because those
[02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:23.160]  from the fifth century up till about the 10th 11th century
[02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:27.160]  it's difficult to find the records of uh of what happened
[02:28:27.160 --> 02:28:30.120]  you know fully and completely and there's a lot of disagreement
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:34.120]  but the inquisition begins now with a guy named dominick goodsman
[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:38.280]  who's called saint dominick uh at about 1207 ad
[02:28:38.280 --> 02:28:42.040]  and there were a series of theological debates that were going on between
[02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:46.840]  these non-catholic believers and the catholic priesthood
[02:28:46.840 --> 02:28:51.320]  and they had debates like public debates in their towns and so on in the town of
[02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:55.800]  albi in france and uh and there were sharp
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:29:01.480]  disagreements but the one thing that the uh the the albogences were known for was
[02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:05.720]  that they paid strict attention to the bible they just believe what the bible
[02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:08.760]  said whereas the catholic priesthood would come in
[02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:13.000]  with the traditions and the official declarations of the holy sea of rome and
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:17.960]  so on in the popes and whatnot um and so in the final debate
[02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:22.200]  uh dominick it was said he lost the debate or so it said
[02:29:22.200 --> 02:29:27.560]  uh and he became so enraged that he he swore slavery and death
[02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:32.360]  against the albogences and uh then he goes back to rome meets with innocent
[02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:37.080]  pope innocent the third and simon demontford and that's the beginning of
[02:29:37.080 --> 02:29:40.920]  the really the inquisition when they okay let's walk through

[02:33:10.200 --> 02:33:15.560]  now i want to be clear the globalists use Balkanization to play us off against
[02:33:15.560 --> 02:33:19.400]  each other so i don't get up on my radio show and bash
[02:33:19.400 --> 02:33:23.720]  Mormons Seventh-day Adventists Catholics Protestants
[02:33:23.720 --> 02:33:27.480]  you know my family on both sides were Protestant activists that came into
[02:33:27.480 --> 02:33:30.200]  Texas my mother's side the heiress family that raised
[02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:35.880]  colonel Travis's son uh they of course brought in bibles
[02:33:35.880 --> 02:33:43.400]  uh in what 1825 and a famous case into Galveston
[02:33:43.400 --> 02:33:48.520]  and they actually had the Jesuit group ran them out of town and tried to
[02:33:48.520 --> 02:33:51.880]  burn their wagons full of Protestant Bibles
[02:33:51.880 --> 02:33:56.440]  uh and i know that big government big churches big state-run religion has
[02:33:56.440 --> 02:33:59.560]  always been a tool of oppression separately
[02:33:59.560 --> 02:34:02.680]  i've had groups connected to the Israeli lobby
[02:34:02.680 --> 02:34:07.320]  over the years uh using bizarre psychology you know if we have a
[02:34:07.320 --> 02:34:10.200]  Papucanan on his Catholic i must work for the secret
[02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:14.600]  Catholic takeover or or you know any other guest i know a lot of Catholics
[02:34:14.600 --> 02:34:17.800]  they're great hard-working good people that are anti-abortion
[02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:21.000]  and and and i know a lot of conservative Catholics that criticize
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:24.120]  the popes calling for new world order i'm not here
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:28.120]  to get people fighting with each other but i have studied quite a bit of
[02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:30.440]  history and we know there was a lot of really bad stuff
[02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:33.400]  throughout the dark ages and middle ages and through that that happened
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:36.120]  i know in the Netherlands and other places once the Protestants got in
[02:34:36.120 --> 02:34:38.440]  control they did a lot of the persecution back to
[02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:42.680]  Catholics now you look at the modern day
[02:34:42.680 --> 02:34:46.120]  this ecumenical merging the religions not just different groups of Christians
[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:48.840]  together this call for world government this is
[02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:51.880]  happening from the Protestants it's happening from the Catholics but the
[02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:55.880]  Catholic Church is at the center of the call for a new world order a global
[02:34:55.880 --> 02:35:00.280]  government in their own documents with the euro
[02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:03.160]  and so the establishment wants to play people
[02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:07.400]  off against each other and you know i don't have a religious broadcast i have
[02:35:07.400 --> 02:35:10.760]  a news and history show and i watched lamp in the
[02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:13.400]  dark before we carried it when they asked us to carry it
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:17.640]  and i found it to be very accurate from my research so we carry it
[02:35:17.640 --> 02:35:21.880]  at the same time though i have seen kind of the christian Zionist
[02:35:21.880 --> 02:35:26.600]  arm that's also a luminous you know saying we've got to have the end of the
[02:35:26.600 --> 02:35:29.240]  world we've got to support Israel no matter what
[02:35:29.240 --> 02:35:32.760]  and then they always put out an anti-catholic view
[02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:36.600]  and claim the Catholic Church wants to run Jerusalem and and do all this stuff
[02:35:36.600 --> 02:35:40.360]  i mean it's very sophisticated and i've been studying it
[02:35:40.360 --> 02:35:45.000]  and trying to understand it and i think uh that chris pinto with a lamp in the
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:48.360]  dark has really done a good job of of of of
[02:35:48.360 --> 02:35:52.040]  breaking this down but i mean going back to some of the issues though
[02:35:52.040 --> 02:35:55.960]  that i just raised here that's why i believe in what our founding fathers
[02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:58.680]  did saying freedom of religion that's not what the
[02:35:58.680 --> 02:36:02.200]  un and others are calling for they're saying no a one world religion
[02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:05.800]  or you can be whatever religion you want but you can't criticize any other
[02:36:05.800 --> 02:36:10.200]  religion chris pinto yeah that's uh that's the whole point that's
[02:36:10.200 --> 02:36:15.080]  becoming the new inquisition um it's uh there's that case over in
[02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:18.440]  england of the christian couple who witnessed to a muslim woman
[02:36:18.440 --> 02:36:21.400]  and you know the muslim woman talked about her faith and the christians talked
[02:36:21.400 --> 02:36:24.760]  about their faith uh but now the the muslim woman felt
[02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:29.240]  like she was being oppressed because the christians were criticizing islam
[02:36:29.240 --> 02:36:32.200]  and then they ended up being you know suffering a certain amount of persecution
[02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:36.120]  over there in england uh so they're trying to make it illegal in canada
[02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:41.640]  to read certain bible verses and uh there's all these calls for censorship
[02:36:41.640 --> 02:36:45.240]  that are going on that once you censor one group you censor everybody but
[02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:48.760]  getting up into the middle ages the dark ages when we start seeing the real
[02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:53.800]  persecution right it it it really began over the
[02:36:53.800 --> 02:36:59.000]  reading of the bible and the preaching of what's written in the bible that began
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.960]  the inquisition a lot of people don't know that that's one of the reasons why
[02:37:01.960 --> 02:37:06.920]  i want to give the history in lamp but but that's what led to two things one
[02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:11.880]  the uh really it was the establishment of the first police state if you read some
[02:37:11.880 --> 02:37:15.720]  historian that's what they'll say that the the inquisition
[02:37:15.720 --> 02:37:19.960]  where you developed a system of informants you developed a police system
[02:37:19.960 --> 02:37:23.160]  that was intercontinental there were no boundaries for the inquisition they
[02:37:23.160 --> 02:37:26.840]  could go to any country in europe and hold people accountable
[02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:30.920]  um they were there kind of like uh interpol or the the fed
[02:37:30.920 --> 02:37:34.280]  uh they could cross any border and uh
[02:37:34.280 --> 02:37:38.840]  uh that's when they began to outlaw the bible and that's why they outlawed the
[02:37:38.840 --> 02:37:42.360]  bible uh the bible became a a forbidden book
[02:37:42.360 --> 02:37:46.120]  as it's called in one of the documentaries and then we saw things
[02:37:46.120 --> 02:37:50.120]  like uh when they wanted to build the new vatican building indulgences get
[02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:53.240]  your family out of purgatory pay all this gold
[02:37:53.240 --> 02:37:56.920]  and similarly we see the un and the e you selling
[02:37:56.920 --> 02:38:01.240]  and al gore admits it a global religion of gaya where they go out and persecute
[02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:07.000]  everyone and have a new inquisition i think it's the same the same spirit the
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:12.200]  same principles involved ultimately uh and it's uh it's
[02:38:12.200 --> 02:38:15.720]  you know it's been going on for centuries and centuries and centuries
[02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:19.640]  and it you know as we show it in our film we show the bible
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:22.360]  really and the word of god and those who believe it
[02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:27.400]  as the center of controversy uh and the oppression that uh that came against
[02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:31.640]  them to you know forbid anyone uh from having another opinion
[02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:35.320]  and uh and if you follow that history it brings you up
[02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:39.560]  through you know the 19th century into modern times i believe this has
[02:38:39.560 --> 02:38:43.480]  everything to do with why they've kicked the bible out of our school system
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:47.720]  along with prayer and a lot of other things okay but explain this to me
[02:38:47.720 --> 02:38:51.240]  explain to me how the illuminati starts forming
[02:38:51.240 --> 02:38:55.720]  secret societies masons groups that don't like the dominance of the catholic
[02:38:55.720 --> 02:38:59.960]  church but then we today see the catholic church
[02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:03.320]  selling the same things that the illuminati was selling so
[02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:07.080]  how does that intertwine it's a complicated history
[02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:10.040]  and there's you have you have different people you have people who believe
[02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:15.080]  that the illuminati was actually formed by the jesuit order
[02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:19.000]  which was when when the reformation got underway you have these bible believers
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:22.520]  they're preaching and then they start the printing press comes along and
[02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:26.680]  they start you know manufacturing bibles faster than they can be destroyed
[02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:30.760]  so there's a way to control opposition the jesuit priest adam vice hop
[02:39:30.760 --> 02:39:35.160]  sets it up well you you have the the jesuits were founded
[02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:38.920]  to destroy the reformation to destroy the reformers
[02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:43.960]  and those who are opposing rome okay so they launched a counter reformation
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:48.760]  and uh and they they started getting into academics and they tried to
[02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:53.400]  do it that way but what was happening was they they weren't having success in
[02:39:53.400 --> 02:39:57.320]  persuading people to come back to rome and a lot of countries
[02:39:57.320 --> 02:40:01.320]  were being converted to they were becoming Protestant countries
[02:40:01.320 --> 02:40:04.440]  and they were casting off the authority of the pope seek of the pope
[02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:09.160]  was a very political figure if the pope told a king or a queen or whoever what
[02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:12.360]  to do they were supposed to do it and the pope was telling people go and
[02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:15.960]  invade that other country and you kill those people over there
[02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:19.640]  and i give you the command and if you don't obey me i'll excommunicate you
[02:40:19.640 --> 02:40:23.960]  and your soul will be in hell this is what was going on during the dark ages
[02:40:23.960 --> 02:40:27.800]  so more and more countries were saying no we don't believe this anymore we
[02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:30.360]  don't believe the pope has the authority to do that
[02:40:30.360 --> 02:40:33.880]  and they were listening to men like martin luther and william tim dale and
[02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:37.160]  calvin and others and uh so
[02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:40.440]  with the jesuits had to come up with a plan
[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:45.320]  to somehow or other do something about all of these Protestant kings and queens
[02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:48.920]  that were opposing them now there's two different views there are some who
[02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:51.720]  believe that the infidels that infidelity
[02:40:51.720 --> 02:40:54.760]  which is really what the revolutionaries were about getting rid of god
[02:40:54.760 --> 02:40:59.640]  altogether uh just rose up in the midst of all this
[02:40:59.640 --> 02:41:03.800]  and decided to get rid of roman Catholicism get rid of Protestantism get
[02:41:03.800 --> 02:41:08.360]  rid of all of it and that's what the Illuminati was about
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:12.680]  but then there are others alex who believe because the Illuminati was
[02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:16.040]  founded at the University of Ingolstadt
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:20.520]  by a Jesuit named Adam Weissacht and he was a Jesuit priest
[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:25.320]  and he openly stated that he was going to use the methods of revolution
[02:41:25.320 --> 02:41:31.320]  and infiltration and information warfare that the Jesuits had been
[02:41:31.320 --> 02:41:35.480]  perfecting from sunsues the art of war that they brought from china and
[02:41:35.480 --> 02:41:38.520]  translated and so on uh and if you read authors like
[02:41:38.520 --> 02:41:43.720]  f-tupper saucy who wrote the book rulers of evil saucy believes
[02:41:43.720 --> 02:41:49.240]  that the Illuminati is really a front organization for the Jesuit order
[02:41:49.240 --> 02:41:52.920]  and that the Illuminati because the Jesuits became so nefarious they were
[02:41:52.920 --> 02:41:57.320]  kicked out of 40 countries throughout europe they were kicked out of japan
[02:41:57.320 --> 02:42:01.160]  the the the name Jesuit was synonymous with nazi
[02:42:01.160 --> 02:42:05.720]  you know uh everybody thought you know if you if you met or knew a Jesuit you
[02:42:05.720 --> 02:42:09.960]  immediately suspected him as a deceiver and a spy or
[02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:13.480]  something like that so they had to do something
[02:42:13.480 --> 02:42:17.720]  uh and so they developed two mottos one above all else
[02:42:17.720 --> 02:42:21.880]  not too much zeal to be more subtle and they said
[02:42:21.880 --> 02:42:26.840]  let us shun too much light let's not put ourselves out there so that anybody
[02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:30.120]  will know who we are we need to go back into the shadows here
[02:42:30.120 --> 02:42:33.080]  and there are some who believe that Weissacht
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:38.520]  was an instrument of the Jesuit order uh who set up the Illuminati
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:43.960]  as a front organization that could then infiltrate these secret societies like
[02:42:43.960 --> 02:42:48.680]  the Freemasons and others uh and begin to manipulate them
[02:42:48.680 --> 02:42:52.600]  to carry out Rome's thousand-year-old agenda
[02:42:52.600 --> 02:42:57.720]  of world domination uh when the Jesuits take their oath for example
[02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:01.160]  uh they swear in their oath with the Jesuit general you know the general
[02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:05.560]  tells him go into all the world and claim all lands
[02:43:05.560 --> 02:43:09.400]  in the name of the pope he who will not accept him as Christ
[02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:13.000]  vice-region on earth let him be accursed and exterminated
[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:17.080]  and this is why it is said you find Jesuits in every corner of the world
[02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:20.600]  with schools and universities and colleges and so on
[02:43:20.600 --> 02:43:23.880]  uh this is why they have gone into all the world
[02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:28.200]  is to dominate the world for the pope
[02:43:28.200 --> 02:43:32.360]  and that's covered in a uh lamp in the dark continue
[02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:37.800]  yeah so it's and it's and what's interesting is you have all of these secret
[02:43:37.800 --> 02:43:41.880]  organizations that will admit like the Illuminati openly admitted
[02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:46.440]  that they adopted their methodology from the Jesuit order that they studied
[02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:49.800]  what the Jesuits did and how they did it uh
[02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:54.040]  Rockefellers there's a there's a book written on the life of John D
[02:43:54.040 --> 02:43:58.120]  Rockefeller how he developed his whole Rockefeller organization
[02:43:58.120 --> 02:44:02.120]  around the discipline of the Jesuit order uh my wife
[02:44:02.120 --> 02:44:05.800]  works for an accounting firm and when she was going through college she
[02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:08.600]  remembers this you know these big accounting firms talking about how
[02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:12.600]  they study the Jesuit order uh to develop their
[02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:17.000]  you know systems for finance and so on uh there was a guy
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:20.760]  Alberto Izaga like a year and a half ago
[02:44:20.760 --> 02:44:25.640]  who went nuts suddenly over in London and killed his two-year-old daughter
[02:44:25.640 --> 02:44:29.400]  uh and it was a bizarre case but he was a bit he was like a millionaire
[02:44:29.400 --> 02:44:33.240]  a finance guy and worked for some powerful company
[02:44:33.240 --> 02:44:36.440]  and when they arrested him while he was on trial
[02:44:36.440 --> 02:44:40.360]  he was muttering that he was part of an international conspiracy
[02:44:40.360 --> 02:44:44.600]  to take over the financial world and he was working with a
[02:44:44.600 --> 02:44:49.800]  secret group of financiers who were using the methods that the Jesuit order
[02:44:49.800 --> 02:44:54.040]  to take over the financial world well i read Heinz Hobel's order of the death
[02:44:54.040 --> 02:44:58.120]  said and had the Nazi documents where Hitler modeled the Gestapo
[02:44:58.120 --> 02:45:01.320]  and his secret police ss off of the Jesuits
[02:45:01.320 --> 02:45:05.000]  absolutely there there's a number of books written about that
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.960]  uh and we talk about that in the lamp in the dark as well
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:11.560]  but and and that whole relationship a lot of people are shocked when they
[02:45:11.560 --> 02:45:15.720]  learn about you know the idea that that the Vatican
[02:45:15.720 --> 02:45:20.360]  was working with Hitler and that they had a concordat with Germany and so on
[02:45:20.360 --> 02:45:25.000]  but adrian hilton in his book uh the principal in the power of europe the
[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:28.360]  guy who's talking about the european union he says the way to
[02:45:28.360 --> 02:45:31.480]  understand that is to go back and look at the
[02:45:31.480 --> 02:45:35.320]  relationship of the Vatican with charlemagne
[02:45:35.320 --> 02:45:39.240]  charlemagne who was the first holy roman emperor he reigned over
[02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:43.640]  germany okay so all the way back eighth century
[02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:49.720]  ad the pope crowned charlemagne as you know the first holy roman emperor
[02:45:49.720 --> 02:45:53.880]  and from then on so many of these european families
[02:45:53.880 --> 02:45:59.000]  if you get the national geographic uh documentary inside the Vatican
[02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:02.200]  and it's it's during the time of pope john paul the second
[02:46:02.200 --> 02:46:08.200]  you see all of this these royal members of the european families and so on
[02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:13.000]  who go to the Vatican and they all bow down and they kiss the pope's ring
[02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:18.200]  you know and they venerate him like he's a god you know let's expand on that
[02:46:18.200 --> 02:46:21.240]  because i'm going to again from your research understand something
[02:46:21.240 --> 02:46:25.240]  we know that the king of england eber the eighth was a nazi a fan of hitler had
[02:46:25.240 --> 02:46:28.920]  to escape germany once the war started he was from a
[02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:31.720]  german family the the house of winsor's really the
[02:46:31.720 --> 02:46:36.040]  house of sax cobar gotha for those that don't know
[02:46:36.040 --> 02:46:40.280]  why then if the Vatican was so powerful and setting up this continental empire
[02:46:40.280 --> 02:46:44.920]  through germany and through miscellany why then did england and the us turn
[02:46:44.920 --> 02:46:49.800]  against them when we know the alumnus were involved as your film show
[02:46:49.800 --> 02:46:53.960]  in a lot of the formation of the united states and the free masons if that's
[02:46:53.960 --> 02:46:57.560]  all controlled by the Vatican then why and we know there was a secret
[02:46:57.560 --> 02:47:00.840]  peace treaty now declassified between england and germany
[02:47:00.840 --> 02:47:06.760]  so why then was hitler rebuffed because it does appear there are some power
[02:47:06.760 --> 02:47:11.560]  shifts here clearly bilderberg is dominated by the papacy
[02:47:11.560 --> 02:47:15.080]  but then it interlocks with the united states and so these groups fight
[02:47:15.080 --> 02:47:17.160]  sometimes or what's going on
[02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:20.200]  it seemed you know that there are different theories that i've read because
[02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:22.520]  that's a great question if it's the one that
[02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:25.480]  you know sort of drives the research so much of it
[02:47:25.480 --> 02:47:29.240]  uh... but the from from the argument that i've heard it's kind of like the
[02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:34.280]  ordo abt keo order out of chaos you create the chaos and from that
[02:47:34.280 --> 02:47:36.920]  you know through the chaos that you've created
[02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:41.160]  you establish your world order uh... and there are some people who believe
[02:47:41.160 --> 02:47:45.720]  that uh... that germany was being used there are some who even think that
[02:47:45.720 --> 02:47:50.600]  germany was used specifically because it was martin luther who was a german
[02:47:50.600 --> 02:47:56.200]  who from germany launched the process of reformation well it was uh...
[02:47:56.200 --> 02:47:59.560]  and we actually know from the lord millner group
[02:47:59.560 --> 02:48:02.680]  that right after world war one these are public documents they said we're
[02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:06.920]  going to finance a war leader we're going to build germany up and then
[02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:10.360]  we're going to destroy them just like world war one
[02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:14.760]  and so it was a repeat of that that's exactly that that
[02:48:14.760 --> 02:48:18.200]  concurs with the research that that i've been getting in
[02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:21.720]  and the theory that people believe that the reason roam
[02:48:21.720 --> 02:48:26.040]  and it does what's wanted revenge on germany that they wanted to use germany
[02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:31.000]  if you will uh... as this kind of you know instrument of destruction
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:34.840]  was partly revenge for the reformation
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:38.120]  because it was from germany that the uh... reform
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:41.400]  was launched you know but but but i mean why
[02:48:41.400 --> 02:48:44.680]  why do that when germany was pretty much a catholic country
[02:48:44.680 --> 02:48:47.720]  at that time and through the world council of churches the Rockefeller
[02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:51.480]  setup most of the protestant churches are new world order now
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:55.720]  i mean because you're you're you're going back to the jesuit stealth mode
[02:48:55.720 --> 02:48:59.480]  right now that's a very good question and i wish i had a more detailed answer
[02:48:59.480 --> 02:49:03.960]  for you i i think there's there's something to the doctrine
[02:49:03.960 --> 02:49:08.680]  if you study the jesuits in history they were always known for their
[02:49:08.680 --> 02:49:12.360]  revenge and that they would not stop until they got
[02:49:12.360 --> 02:49:15.160]  vengeance on whoever was that had opposed them
[02:49:15.160 --> 02:49:18.440]  and this is why john adam says in his quote
[02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:22.520]  he says that all the monarchs of europe trembled in fear
[02:49:22.520 --> 02:49:27.640]  over the idea of jesuit assassination because if you cross these guys
[02:49:27.640 --> 02:49:31.880]  they didn't care how long it took it could take a year five years ten years
[02:49:31.880 --> 02:49:35.880]  they would come after you uh... and they would find a way to get you
[02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:39.160]  uh... one of the popes that uh... suppressed them
[02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:42.200]  uh... signed the bull you know of of eternal
[02:49:42.200 --> 02:49:46.280]  you know excommunication for the jesuit yeah that's another issue why did the
[02:49:46.280 --> 02:49:50.520]  catholic church go after the jesuits so are you saying it's more the jesuits
[02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:53.880]  than just the catholic i mean it's it's so complex
[02:49:53.880 --> 02:49:57.800]  it is at the the way that i see it they it there's a medal
[02:49:57.800 --> 02:50:01.960]  that they uh... like uh... uh... uh... a medal that they strike
[02:50:01.960 --> 02:50:04.120]  in rome or at least in the nineteenth century
[02:50:04.120 --> 02:50:07.400]  where you have the pope sitting up on a high altar in st peters
[02:50:07.400 --> 02:50:10.680]  and all these cardinals kneeling down in front of them and there's a latin
[02:50:10.680 --> 02:50:15.400]  phrase uh... that says whom they uh... create
[02:50:15.400 --> 02:50:19.640]  they adore okay uh... uh... creme creant
[02:50:19.640 --> 02:50:24.120]  adorant who they create they adore the jesuits if you read their writings they
[02:50:24.120 --> 02:50:27.720]  believe the pope is kind of like their idol
[02:50:27.720 --> 02:50:32.200]  okay just as a man would take a you know uh... chisel and carve out an idol
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:34.680]  from stone and then set it up on an altar
[02:50:34.680 --> 02:50:38.120]  that's what the pope is for them they create him
[02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:43.080]  they put him up on an altar and he's got to be the pope that they want him to be
[02:50:43.080 --> 02:50:47.160]  so it's a figurehead it's a it's an organizational structure
[02:50:47.160 --> 02:50:50.680]  exactly around which the power behind the throne
[02:50:50.680 --> 02:50:55.640]  builds its system well there's no doubt that uh... Rome is deeply behind the
[02:50:55.640 --> 02:50:58.760]  EU no doubt it's calling for a new world order
[02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:01.240]  and uh... just hardcore info stay with us chris penthouse

[02:54:11.960 --> 02:54:14.600]  say the catholics are the center of all evil or
[02:54:14.600 --> 02:54:19.880]  masons are jews and when i found from my research is that humans are all humans
[02:54:19.880 --> 02:54:23.960]  people are people you got good people you got bad people from all groups
[02:54:23.960 --> 02:54:28.040]  but there were systems developed in europe in the last 2000 years
[02:54:28.040 --> 02:54:32.120]  of manipulation of control a lot of it borrowed from the roman empire and
[02:54:32.120 --> 02:54:35.480]  they're you know 500 years of managing an empire 500
[02:54:35.480 --> 02:54:42.120]  plus years you know from 100 bc to 410
[02:54:42.120 --> 02:54:46.040]  so we're talking about 600 plus years there and
[02:54:46.040 --> 02:54:49.400]  i just want to get people thinking and that's why this film a lamp in the

[02:55:16.760 --> 02:55:19.240]  lamp in the dark well one point that i want to make
[02:55:19.240 --> 02:55:22.040]  just to address something that you've been saying alex we try to make the
[02:55:22.040 --> 02:55:26.280]  point in the film that uh all most all of your major
[02:55:26.280 --> 02:55:29.800]  reformers through the through the middle ages and the dark ages
[02:55:29.800 --> 02:55:33.640]  uh were catholic priests uh guys like uh john wickliffe
[02:55:33.640 --> 02:55:37.080]  uh william tyndale martin luther uh jan huss
[02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:40.280]  gerome prog all of these were catholic priests
[02:55:40.280 --> 02:55:45.160]  who began reading the bible uh and they just fell in love with the word of god
[02:55:45.160 --> 02:55:49.000]  and they began to speak out uh on behalf of the truth
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:52.600]  and some of them never actually even left the catholic priesthood they were
[02:55:52.600 --> 02:55:57.240]  defrocked like tyndale and so on uh even in the 19th century
[02:55:57.240 --> 02:56:01.800]  uh charles chinak we uh who you know wrote the book 50 years in the church of
[02:56:01.800 --> 02:56:06.680]  rome where he's trying to warn america about really roams infiltration of the
[02:56:06.680 --> 02:56:09.880]  united states and their plan to take over the country
[02:56:09.880 --> 02:56:13.320]  um and i know one thing and this is what i really don't like
[02:56:13.320 --> 02:56:17.080]  the catholic church is promoting breaking down our borders not just in europe
[02:56:17.080 --> 02:56:20.840]  that with mexico and bankrupting our nation and making us a third world police
[02:56:20.840 --> 02:56:24.520]  state like latin america that's something you can definitely
[02:56:24.520 --> 02:56:29.480]  nail on the vatican's door well they believe there are those those who who
[02:56:29.480 --> 02:56:33.640]  research that from what i'm reading they believe like that the influx of the
[02:56:33.640 --> 02:56:38.120]  irish immigrants the italian immigrants these are all catholics coming in
[02:56:38.120 --> 02:56:42.200]  and that the popes for over a hundred years have wanted to flood this country
[02:56:42.200 --> 02:56:45.960]  with roman catholics and they believe that's the reason why they want all of
[02:56:45.960 --> 02:56:49.480]  the mexicans to come in through the border to build up the catholic
[02:56:49.480 --> 02:56:54.200]  population so they'll vote according to the commandments of
[02:56:54.200 --> 02:56:59.000]  the papacy but separately we have the immigrants voting for abortion and
[02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:02.120]  things uh and supporting obama with this new fake
[02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:06.760]  coffee party stealing our idea to actually help the tea party
[02:57:06.760 --> 02:57:11.000]  be more constitutional and take it back away from the republicans
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:14.520]  again i'm trying to figure all this out chris and well
[02:57:14.520 --> 02:57:18.280]  well with roam here here's here's a picture i would give alex very quickly
[02:57:18.280 --> 02:57:23.320]  when the pope came to america george bush the conservative republican president
[02:57:23.320 --> 02:57:25.720]  came and met him right and honored him greatly
[02:57:25.720 --> 02:57:29.960]  and with him was nancy polosi the ultimate left-wing liberal
[02:57:29.960 --> 02:57:33.800]  who came and bowed down and kissed his ring people often think of
[02:57:33.800 --> 02:57:38.120]  of roam as being conservative but they forget the liberal side of roam
[02:57:38.120 --> 02:57:41.400]  the kennedy family is very roman catholic
[02:57:41.400 --> 02:57:45.160]  uh and they're very pro-abortion very liberal and so on
[02:57:45.160 --> 02:57:48.920]  it was Notre Dame that brought obama in and gave him
[02:57:48.920 --> 02:57:53.480]  a uh you know his honorary degree and had him you know speak there even though
[02:57:53.480 --> 02:57:56.600]  he holds these wild uh abortion views and so on
[02:57:56.600 --> 02:57:59.880]  roam tries to grab everybody on the right hand
[02:57:59.880 --> 02:58:04.200]  and on the left hand and bring them all together into this world system
[02:58:04.200 --> 02:58:08.760]  but as you said just just as it was 500 years ago there are a lot of catholics
[02:58:08.760 --> 02:58:12.520]  worldwide who are very conservative and are upset about what's happening
[02:58:12.520 --> 02:58:16.760]  absolutely and it's often said that if catholics in america knew fully what
[02:58:16.760 --> 02:58:20.120]  the Vatican was up to they would be outraged
[02:58:20.120 --> 02:58:24.200]  all right well chris pentale amazing film people should watch it and make up

[03:01:55.160 --> 03:01:57.560]  these people they've got other initiatives to make
[03:01:57.560 --> 03:02:01.560]  themselves a free press zone against the shutdown of the internet
[03:02:01.560 --> 03:02:04.520]  she's with us for the next hour joins us via
[03:02:04.520 --> 03:02:08.200]  video link from iceland and uh...
[03:02:08.200 --> 03:02:12.760]  amiss jones dotier thanks for coming on with us
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:16.040]  it's good to have you here uh... we're about to go to break but but this is
[03:02:16.040 --> 03:02:18.840]  this is huge what happened because of the rest of the world
[03:02:18.840 --> 03:02:23.400]  takes what you've done as an example we could end up actually routing this
[03:02:23.400 --> 03:02:29.080]  uh... this group of criminals absolutely i mean i hope that uh... what we did
[03:02:29.080 --> 03:02:35.160]  by uh... forcing uh... the uh... government to allow the nation to vote on
[03:02:35.160 --> 03:02:39.080]  this will be an inspiration for other people and it was actually
[03:02:39.080 --> 03:02:42.760]  more than sixty percent uh... almost sixty three percent of the nation
[03:02:42.760 --> 03:02:45.880]  showed up to the polls and it was a ninety
[03:02:45.880 --> 03:02:51.400]  three percent no ninety three percent said no
[03:02:51.400 --> 03:02:56.040]  ninety three percent said no to what tell folks specifically what happened
[03:02:56.040 --> 03:02:59.960]  they basically were saying no of uh... privatization
[03:02:59.960 --> 03:03:04.520]  or socialization of private debt uh... or in other words to bail out of the
[03:03:04.520 --> 03:03:10.200]  bankers the socialization of private debt or the bankers come in
[03:03:10.200 --> 03:03:14.120]  sell a bunch of derivatives and then claim the people owe it
[03:03:14.120 --> 03:03:18.280]  well the thing is we had uh... yeah some of the Icelandic bankers
[03:03:18.280 --> 03:03:23.400]  decided to branch out because of uh... EU regulation branch out to Europe
[03:03:23.400 --> 03:03:29.240]  open internet bank accounts there uh... and then when these accounts
[03:03:29.240 --> 03:03:34.520]  collapse uh... the president of government claims that the Icelandic
[03:03:34.520 --> 03:03:40.040]  nation should pull out the uh... face guarantee for this
[03:03:40.040 --> 03:03:42.440]  and you have to bear in mind there are like three hundred and seventeen
[03:03:42.440 --> 03:03:45.560]  thousand people living in Iceland and the accounts
[03:03:45.560 --> 03:03:49.640]  uh... in Holland and Britain were around three hundred and twenty thousand
[03:03:49.640 --> 03:03:52.680]  so each Icelanders should have showed around
[03:03:52.680 --> 03:03:57.960]  twenty thousand euros per person and an insult to injury
[03:03:57.960 --> 03:04:01.720]  they use anti-terror laws to try to take people's money
[03:04:01.720 --> 03:04:05.400]  yeah what they did uh... just shortly after the collapse
[03:04:05.400 --> 03:04:11.560]  uh... uh... Mr. Darling uh... the UK finance minister decided to
[03:04:11.560 --> 03:04:16.760]  and Mr. Brown the minister of the UK said to put terrorist acts on Iceland
[03:04:16.760 --> 03:04:21.160]  uh... which classified us among other
[03:04:21.160 --> 03:04:24.600]  uh... nations that does North Korea, Simbapwe and
[03:04:24.600 --> 03:04:29.240]  uh... organizations that does Al Qaeda and what they did
[03:04:29.240 --> 03:04:33.160]  during our middle of the financial meltdown in Iceland
[03:04:33.160 --> 03:04:37.480]  was that it dried up all the online to Iceland and we were facing
[03:04:37.480 --> 03:04:41.080]  food shortages and medicine shortages well let's break down
[03:04:41.080 --> 03:04:45.400]  uh... the history of what happened what it's led to
[03:04:45.400 --> 03:04:49.400]  where you go from here this is so exciting
[03:04:49.400 --> 03:04:53.640]  90 plus percent of the country saying no to the jackals
[03:04:53.640 --> 03:04:57.800]  the Icelanders know who their enemy is they know who the criminals are
[03:04:57.800 --> 03:05:02.280]  will we follow their example
[03:05:02.280 --> 03:05:06.280]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[03:05:06.280 --> 03:05:09.480]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[03:05:09.480 --> 03:05:13.480]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[03:05:13.480 --> 03:05:14.760]  the Americans at home
[03:05:14.760 --> 03:05:18.760]  I have a tremendous influence on our president in congress
[03:05:18.760 --> 03:05:23.480]  and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:05:23.480 --> 03:05:25.880]  as American citizens to pay attention
[03:05:25.880 --> 03:05:29.080]  fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[03:05:29.080 --> 03:05:33.480]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[03:05:33.480 --> 03:05:35.960]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[03:05:35.960 --> 03:05:39.800]  Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches
[03:05:39.800 --> 03:05:42.360]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[03:05:42.360 --> 03:05:46.680]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC
[03:05:46.680 --> 03:05:49.560]  we have seen a fall of the republic

[03:08:24.520 --> 03:08:28.520]  say no to the private bank heist the banking
[03:08:28.520 --> 03:08:32.120]  tyranny you have found it folks the tip of the spear and the fight against the

[03:08:37.880 --> 03:08:41.160]  patriot radio show on a mfm global shortwave satellite
[03:08:41.160 --> 03:08:45.320]  and internet going back to bergita continuing
[03:08:45.320 --> 03:08:51.800]  recap what the banks did the fraud the year of protest the terrorism act used
[03:08:51.800 --> 03:08:55.480]  the threats by the banks to shut your country down food shortages
[03:08:55.480 --> 03:09:03.320]  and the people standing strong well i guess it all began well i'm sure
[03:09:03.320 --> 03:09:06.680]  many of your listeners have seen the film about andron
[03:09:06.680 --> 03:09:10.600]  and andron was about the same size as the population in iceland
[03:09:10.600 --> 03:09:14.200]  so very many when we watched andron on the national tv in iceland
[03:09:14.200 --> 03:09:18.040]  very many people felt that we had were like the regularly staff
[03:09:18.040 --> 03:09:22.760]  regular staff of andron not knowing what the tops were up to
[03:09:22.760 --> 03:09:27.560]  and when everything collapsed in august 2008
[03:09:27.560 --> 03:09:31.560]  most people in iceland had no idea what was going on so it came as a complete
[03:09:31.560 --> 03:09:36.280]  shock to the nation so what had happened
[03:09:36.280 --> 03:09:39.160]  five years prior the banks were privatized
[03:09:39.160 --> 03:09:42.760]  with a little help from the independence party in iceland
[03:09:42.760 --> 03:09:47.720]  and progressive party they basically donated the banks that
[03:09:47.720 --> 03:09:54.360]  really very good prices wholesale prices to their friends and allies
[03:09:54.360 --> 03:10:00.280]  and because we are like 80 percent of our regulations around banks are based on
[03:10:00.280 --> 03:10:04.840]  the EU regulations they managed to start to
[03:10:04.840 --> 03:10:09.080]  branch out to other countries and they were basically
[03:10:09.080 --> 03:10:15.000]  like very many of the bankers high on world domination
[03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:18.440]  i don't know fantasies and they wanted to take over the banks
[03:10:18.440 --> 03:10:23.080]  the bank sector in the uk and in europe and i guess they didn't make a lot of
[03:10:23.080 --> 03:10:26.680]  friends and you know in general they were quite
[03:10:26.680 --> 03:10:31.800]  naive and they had no understanding about how the system worked in general
[03:10:31.800 --> 03:10:35.480]  so it was like school children running amok with a lot of
[03:10:35.480 --> 03:10:40.360]  you know virtual money which they sort of sucked out of
[03:10:40.360 --> 03:10:45.400]  regularly regular bank or you know people that saved their money in banks
[03:10:45.400 --> 03:10:48.760]  and so forth and they actually conned people into moving
[03:10:48.760 --> 03:10:52.840]  their savings into these unsaved accounts and it especially targeted
[03:10:52.840 --> 03:10:56.600]  the elderly people and the immigrants and so forth
[03:10:56.600 --> 03:11:00.920]  um but that was during the last year of this insanity
[03:11:00.920 --> 03:11:05.640]  so people in general thought that we were going through this incredible big
[03:11:05.640 --> 03:11:10.440]  boom which i guess was largely just an illusion
[03:11:10.440 --> 03:11:15.960]  so people took loans they offered a hundred percent loans on
[03:11:15.960 --> 03:11:20.120]  mortgages and so forth and foreign currency loans on cars
[03:11:20.120 --> 03:11:24.040]  and right now very many people are facing foreclosures
[03:11:24.040 --> 03:11:28.520]  they are facing foreclosures because of um if they
[03:11:28.520 --> 03:11:33.640]  you know went bankrupt on a car loan because in island we don't have that
[03:11:33.640 --> 03:11:37.000]  wonderful legislation you have where you can actually return the keys and then
[03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:39.560]  you know if your house and then you are sort of free
[03:11:39.560 --> 03:11:43.720]  they will follow you with your debt for the rest of your life and you will never
[03:11:43.720 --> 03:11:48.760]  be clear the banks have done this in argentina in greece in spain in the
[03:11:48.760 --> 03:11:53.160]  u.s they make this fiat derivatives bubble it's just
[03:11:53.160 --> 03:11:56.360]  made up crud paper they certify it as triple a
[03:11:56.360 --> 03:12:00.280]  gold rated they sell it to governments they sell it to citizens they get all
[03:12:00.280 --> 03:12:03.960]  the wealth and then it came out that goldman sacks and others by design
[03:12:03.960 --> 03:12:06.360]  mainstream news the cladging newspapers and others
[03:12:06.360 --> 03:12:09.720]  they then blow it out at the time of their choosing
[03:12:09.720 --> 03:12:13.240]  and use the implosion to then come in and buy everything up
[03:12:13.240 --> 03:12:17.960]  and island is the only modern country to be put through this scam to say no
[03:12:17.960 --> 03:12:22.600]  continue yeah well that was a long way to get to
[03:12:22.600 --> 03:12:29.080]  that no i tell you a lot of fight um but uh in general what happened you
[03:12:29.080 --> 03:12:33.400]  know as i'm sure that most of the listeners of the show understand how
[03:12:33.400 --> 03:12:38.360]  the imf works so what happened after the terrorist act was placed on island
[03:12:38.360 --> 03:12:43.480]  uh the uk and the netherland government said
[03:12:43.480 --> 03:12:49.640]  uh with a little help from our Nordic friends said okay if you want to be
[03:12:49.640 --> 03:12:53.240]  get any loans or the loan lines open you're gonna have to go into an imf
[03:12:53.240 --> 03:12:56.200]  program and in order for you to go into the
[03:12:56.200 --> 03:12:59.880]  math program you're gonna have to solve this isaf dispute
[03:12:59.880 --> 03:13:03.240]  which is this dispute about the banks that were in
[03:13:03.240 --> 03:13:07.240]  the uk and holland and so let me just stop you for a moment going back a year
[03:13:07.240 --> 03:13:10.680]  ago uh the food's not being shipped in everything's
[03:13:10.680 --> 03:13:14.280]  falling apart they're saying we've got to sell all the government assets take
[03:13:14.280 --> 03:13:19.000]  citizens tax money all for these banks and the bbc reported
[03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:23.080]  island britain's unlikely new enemy this is from a year ago
[03:13:23.080 --> 03:13:26.440]  and it says until a few days ago britain was admired and respected by the
[03:13:26.440 --> 03:13:30.280]  average islander but the uk's move to seize the assets of this isolated
[03:13:30.280 --> 03:13:33.960]  european state have provoked a backlash of feeling of escalating
[03:13:33.960 --> 03:13:37.880]  resentment they quote treated us like terrorist grabbing the government
[03:13:37.880 --> 03:13:41.400]  accounts grabbing people's bank accounts saying you
[03:13:41.400 --> 03:13:45.320]  we're going to take your money under terror laws and give it to the bankers
[03:13:45.320 --> 03:13:49.320]  continue well it was maybe not that extreme it was
[03:13:49.320 --> 03:13:52.680]  they took over an islandic bank called the heritable bank in in
[03:13:52.680 --> 03:13:57.080]  london uh but what they did it right off the the credit
[03:13:57.080 --> 03:14:01.560]  lines to island and loan lines so uh everybody had to fork up cash during
[03:14:01.560 --> 03:14:05.240]  time of complete uh but that's what it said that in
[03:14:05.240 --> 03:14:08.040]  some cases people couldn't even get their money out for a while though
[03:14:08.040 --> 03:14:13.800]  yeah yeah yeah everything was blocked uh students uh and people from us living
[03:14:13.800 --> 03:14:17.640]  abroad could not get my uh money out of their internet banks and so forth so
[03:14:17.640 --> 03:14:21.000]  they had to uh either start for rely on friends and
[03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:24.360]  family if they had any in the area uh but it also
[03:14:24.360 --> 03:14:30.520]  created um very different difficult paradox because
[03:14:30.520 --> 03:14:34.680]  the social democratic party that is in power now in island
[03:14:34.680 --> 03:14:38.440]  uh have just one dream and that is to join the european union
[03:14:38.440 --> 03:14:45.000]  so within all of this turmoil they decided let's apply for an application
[03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:48.760]  or to join the ua yeah that's key just like
[03:14:48.760 --> 03:14:52.440]  grace 10 years ago you've got to go into debt and sign the deals with these
[03:14:52.440 --> 03:14:57.480]  bankers as part of their rules to get into the EU
[03:14:57.480 --> 03:15:04.280]  mm-hmm well also how they basically used it the the the UK and the net and
[03:15:04.280 --> 03:15:08.200]  governments basically blackmailed us with the EU application as well they said
[03:15:08.200 --> 03:15:13.240]  we will not support your EU application unless
[03:15:13.240 --> 03:15:20.840]  you decide to drop going to court over isafe and unless you just
[03:15:20.840 --> 03:15:24.680]  choose to um you're gonna have to either choose to
[03:15:24.680 --> 03:15:28.840]  become isolated then become you know north
[03:15:28.840 --> 03:15:34.600]  kupa or kupa of the north uh or do as we tell you and that is they
[03:15:34.600 --> 03:15:38.840]  actually and they went even so far as uh wanting to make a hell of a lot of
[03:15:38.840 --> 03:15:42.760]  money out of us by giving us um forcing us
[03:15:42.760 --> 03:15:47.080]  forcing us to pay huge interest on this so um
[03:15:47.080 --> 03:15:51.960]  but we managed to uh stop that uh and right now
[03:15:51.960 --> 03:15:55.800]  i am in a committee of the leadership
[03:15:55.800 --> 03:15:59.960]  working on finding a solution to this and i found it completely unacceptable
[03:15:59.960 --> 03:16:05.480]  that the Icelandic nation will take on any burden from this ordeal
[03:16:05.480 --> 03:16:10.680]  bergita jones down to her a member of the Icelandic parliament continuing so
[03:16:10.680 --> 03:16:13.960]  let's move up to the referendum what did the referendum state it
[03:16:13.960 --> 03:16:17.160]  passed by over 90 percent uh as you just told us
[03:16:17.160 --> 03:16:21.000]  this is completely freaking the bankers out because if countries realize this
[03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:24.520]  has been done by fraud and that it's a made-off scheme
[03:16:24.520 --> 03:16:27.960]  and that the money's not owed the next step is talking about
[03:16:27.960 --> 03:16:31.000]  prosecuting the bankers that ron paul and others
[03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:36.600]  are talking about in this country well the interesting thing and really
[03:16:36.600 --> 03:16:41.560]  disturbing thing about the bankers in iesland or the ieslantic bankers is
[03:16:41.560 --> 03:16:46.040]  that none of their assets have been frozen uh they are most of them are
[03:16:46.040 --> 03:16:49.560]  living in london and and as many people know london is
[03:16:49.560 --> 03:16:53.560]  one of ranked among the fifth best tax havens in the world
[03:16:53.560 --> 03:16:59.160]  um so they are they are actually getting back their companies they're
[03:16:59.160 --> 03:17:02.280]  getting back the power and a lot of write-offs and that is making a lot of
[03:17:02.280 --> 03:17:06.600]  people very upset and angry okay to be clear flesh that out
[03:17:06.600 --> 03:17:10.040]  the bankers that sold you out in your own country
[03:17:10.040 --> 03:17:13.400]  most of them don't even live in your country and the banks know that they're
[03:17:13.400 --> 03:17:17.080]  their minions so they're staying in power
[03:17:17.080 --> 03:17:20.840]  yeah i mean they lost the banks but uh they haven't lost their companies
[03:17:20.840 --> 03:17:25.160]  so i mean one of the oligarchs uh ieslantic oligarchs he owns
[03:17:25.160 --> 03:17:29.640]  the biggest independent media outlet in iesland
[03:17:29.640 --> 03:17:33.160]  so you can imagine what sort of news you're getting from that
[03:17:33.160 --> 03:17:36.920]  but the good news is 90 plus percent vote against him
[03:17:36.920 --> 03:17:40.040]  it shows it's not working but that's what they always have brokerage firms
[03:17:40.040 --> 03:17:43.320]  they separately run banks they get the taxpayers money
[03:17:43.320 --> 03:17:46.760]  they move the money out into their own accounts then they implode it
[03:17:46.760 --> 03:17:51.000]  and try to take over the nation but you've checkmated them
[03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:55.960]  well for now yes definitely uh and i guess
[03:17:55.960 --> 03:18:00.280]  i don't know it actually surprised me that the president of iesland decided to
[03:18:00.280 --> 03:18:03.000]  listen to the nation but there was a huge petition
[03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:08.280]  one 60 000 iesland the ieslanders called on him to allow us to have this
[03:18:08.280 --> 03:18:12.760]  national referendum and uh it was interesting i had
[03:18:12.760 --> 03:18:18.280]  there was actually some documents leaked from the u.s embassy in iesland the
[03:18:18.280 --> 03:18:22.760]  lake of iesland and i found it on wikileaks.org
[03:18:22.760 --> 03:18:27.080]  and it was interesting how the british and
[03:18:27.080 --> 03:18:31.480]  the u.s treasury were very much interested in doing everything in their
[03:18:31.480 --> 03:18:34.360]  power to stop the national referendum
[03:18:34.360 --> 03:18:37.960]  and then the same thing applied to i got some information that
[03:18:37.960 --> 03:18:41.960]  i don't know if you're familiar with the paris club but they were very keen on
[03:18:41.960 --> 03:18:46.040]  stopping this national referendum because uh especially in europe they're
[03:18:46.040 --> 03:18:50.280]  very much afraid that uh like Greece and Ireland
[03:18:50.280 --> 03:18:54.040]  the people there will demand to have a national referendum about
[03:18:54.040 --> 03:18:58.360]  the situation in their countries oh this is big this is huge
[03:18:58.360 --> 03:19:02.040]  i mean the magnitude of this sending the message that this is fraud
[03:19:02.040 --> 03:19:05.240]  we're not paying it we're about to go to break but start telling us about the
[03:19:05.240 --> 03:19:08.760]  documents in the paris club and how the banks don't like what's
[03:19:08.760 --> 03:19:13.880]  happened in iesland
[03:19:14.040 --> 03:19:17.800]  and the paris club was a very interesting club
[03:19:17.800 --> 03:19:23.160]  it is a sort of a secret club run out of paris with some of the most powerful
[03:19:23.160 --> 03:19:27.240]  nations in the world and they determine the interest rates
[03:19:27.240 --> 03:19:33.880]  on nations that have that moratorium and apparently it is
[03:19:33.880 --> 03:19:37.560]  the case of iesland and that national referendum has been discussed in that
[03:19:37.560 --> 03:19:41.720]  club i did a research trying to figure out who is in the club who attended the
[03:19:41.720 --> 03:19:45.480]  meetings and it is impossible to find any information
[03:19:45.480 --> 03:19:49.000]  at least on the internet so i would actually call on if anybody that's
[03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:52.200]  listening to this has any information about the paris club please
[03:19:52.200 --> 03:19:56.200]  provide me with that information we'll give your email out before you leave a
[03:19:56.200 --> 03:19:59.400]  lot more coming up with a member of the

[03:22:27.560 --> 03:22:30.760]  experienced this is not only a transfer of power to an
[03:22:30.760 --> 03:22:34.280]  institution that is not accountable to our elected government but has also
[03:22:34.280 --> 03:22:37.720]  caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value

[03:24:09.000 --> 03:24:13.560]  international banking scam take over the planet set up a bank of the world that
[03:24:13.560 --> 03:24:19.080]  you pay all your carbon taxes to that's being announced can they make Spain the
[03:24:19.080 --> 03:24:24.760]  US England Iceland Argentina Nigeria pay 30 plus
[03:24:24.760 --> 03:24:29.160]  percent compounded interest on fraudulent crud
[03:24:29.160 --> 03:24:33.000]  they created and sold to governments
[03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:37.000]  why aren't they going bankrupt why aren't they being arrested for the fraud
[03:24:37.000 --> 03:24:40.680]  why aren't countries saying no we're not going to give into your financial
[03:24:40.680 --> 03:24:43.880]  terrorism are they told Iceland they would destroy them
[03:24:43.880 --> 03:24:48.520]  in the last year if they didn't capitulate and basically become debt
[03:24:48.520 --> 03:24:53.000]  slaves of these people in perpetuity Iceland had a referendum
[03:24:53.000 --> 03:25:00.120]  93% said no over the weekend and one of the ladies who came from
[03:25:00.120 --> 03:25:03.160]  nowhere just like you can do as citizens around the world
[03:25:03.160 --> 03:25:07.320]  with the truth founded a party is the leader of it one of the main groups that
[03:25:07.320 --> 03:25:11.640]  got this done is Birgitta Jones daughter you're joining us from
[03:25:11.640 --> 03:25:14.840]  Iceland and we'll give you her email and website before
[03:25:14.840 --> 03:25:19.080]  she leaves us later in the hour so that you can send her any intel
[03:25:19.080 --> 03:25:21.240]  because we're all working together on this we'll talk about some other
[03:25:21.240 --> 03:25:24.680]  initiatives in Iceland it being a beacon a hub of freedom
[03:25:24.680 --> 03:25:28.040]  so tell us about the threats what led up to the referendum
[03:25:28.040 --> 03:25:33.160]  what the referendum states and now where you go from here
[03:25:33.160 --> 03:25:37.160]  uh well what led to the referendum was that uh
[03:25:37.160 --> 03:25:43.800]  basically uh we had a contract made between the nations
[03:25:43.800 --> 03:25:49.720]  last summer and it was so bad that the the parliament actually had to spend
[03:25:49.720 --> 03:25:54.280]  two or three months making amendments to it in order for it to be safe for us to
[03:25:54.280 --> 03:25:57.240]  pass it and it still has that incredibly high
[03:25:57.240 --> 03:26:01.160]  interest and so forth but we did put some roof on the payment in
[03:26:01.160 --> 03:26:04.280]  accordance with gtp so if there was no growth in
[03:26:04.280 --> 03:26:07.720]  Iceland then we wouldn't pay anything during those
[03:26:07.720 --> 03:26:14.280]  years however it was extremely bad and we're still paying 5.5
[03:26:14.280 --> 03:26:22.760]  interest which compounds 5.5 percent interest on it
[03:26:22.760 --> 03:26:28.200]  so just paying the interest would have either like okay so 317,000 people in
[03:26:28.200 --> 03:26:32.360]  Iceland 80,000 Icelandic taxpayers would have
[03:26:32.360 --> 03:26:37.800]  be paying only the interest of this isaf deal and that's the same model they
[03:26:37.800 --> 03:26:40.040]  used in all these other countries third world
[03:26:40.040 --> 03:26:43.240]  countries where you'll have a billion dollar loan
[03:26:43.240 --> 03:26:46.520]  back by nothing from the IMF or World Bank to say Nigeria
[03:26:46.520 --> 03:26:50.360]  and then 20 years later they owe 50 something billion
[03:26:50.360 --> 03:26:57.800]  on one billion dollars exactly go ahead and and the thing is that the IMF
[03:26:57.800 --> 03:27:01.560]  which is supposed to be you know supposed to be
[03:27:01.560 --> 03:27:05.560]  an institute you know something that all nations that are part of it pay
[03:27:05.560 --> 03:27:09.720]  into every year and is supposed to not to be interfering in
[03:27:09.720 --> 03:27:14.360]  between states or between countries but the British and
[03:27:14.360 --> 03:27:18.200]  they are big shareholders in it and they have been using it as you know to
[03:27:18.200 --> 03:27:21.480]  blackmail us into submission and that upset
[03:27:21.480 --> 03:27:24.440]  Icelanders tremendously because most Icelanders are not
[03:27:24.440 --> 03:27:28.280]  very happy or keen to be in the IMF program to begin with
[03:27:28.280 --> 03:27:33.960]  because being an IMF program means that there is a complete erosion of
[03:27:33.960 --> 03:27:37.960]  everything that we know as a welfare system
[03:27:37.960 --> 03:27:42.280]  and before all of this we had a very good educational system very good
[03:27:42.280 --> 03:27:44.760]  healthcare everybody had the same access to healthcare
[03:27:44.760 --> 03:27:48.200]  I would get the same doctor as the president without paying anything
[03:27:48.200 --> 03:27:53.320]  so we feel that all of that is going to be lost if we don't stand up to
[03:27:53.320 --> 03:28:00.280]  these forces we're dealing with and I actually put a proposal in parliament
[03:28:00.280 --> 03:28:04.760]  last week about finding a plan B to get rid of the IMF
[03:28:04.760 --> 03:28:09.080]  because there's a lot of fantastic experts economists like Joseph Stiglitz
[03:28:09.080 --> 03:28:15.320]  and many more who have offered to help us find the solution that would be
[03:28:15.320 --> 03:28:18.120]  different and and he said the banks are engaging in
[03:28:18.120 --> 03:28:21.000]  criminal activity and the Federal Reserve is destroying America
[03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:23.880]  he's a Nobel Prize winner for those who don't know
[03:28:23.880 --> 03:28:26.840]  yeah exactly I actually had the privilege of meeting him
[03:28:26.840 --> 03:28:32.600]  last year and also John Perkins and John Perkins said that
[03:28:32.600 --> 03:28:35.480]  we should form an alliance with countries that are you know are facing
[03:28:35.480 --> 03:28:39.800]  similar situations as we are in and I think that is actually a very good
[03:28:39.800 --> 03:28:42.840]  idea and I've been trying to encourage this
[03:28:42.840 --> 03:28:46.440]  government which is you know a left-wing government
[03:28:46.440 --> 03:28:50.920]  which should actually be fighting very much against having an IMF program in
[03:28:50.920 --> 03:28:54.680]  Iceland which the IMF programs goes very much into privatization of
[03:28:54.680 --> 03:28:59.400]  everything but we'll see what happens you know
[03:28:59.400 --> 03:29:04.600]  really the spirit in Iceland right now having only like 1.3% of the nation
[03:29:04.600 --> 03:29:09.400]  saying yes to this I say for deal and 93% saying no
[03:29:09.400 --> 03:29:14.360]  there is really a spirit of or demand from the general public that
[03:29:14.360 --> 03:29:17.880]  the parties move beyond party politics and start to work
[03:29:17.880 --> 03:29:24.200]  for us not I and I and I it's really a time for people parties and people to
[03:29:24.200 --> 03:29:27.720]  start to focus on joint solutions beyond party politics
[03:29:27.720 --> 03:29:30.600]  you've got to circle the wagons against the bankers stay there we're going to
[03:29:30.600 --> 03:29:35.320]  come back and take calls for Brigitte Jones-Dottier I'm Alex Jones
[03:29:35.320 --> 03:29:39.880]  calls only for her on the banking cartel we'll also talk about
[03:29:39.880 --> 03:29:43.160]  are the people of Iceland excited they've had this big victory
[03:29:43.160 --> 03:29:51.560]  how will the banking empire strike back 1-800-259-9231 we'll be right back
[03:29:51.560 --> 03:29:55.480]  we're on the march the empire's on the run
[03:29:55.480 --> 03:30:00.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[03:30:00.840 --> 03:30:04.040]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[03:30:04.040 --> 03:30:08.040]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[03:30:08.040 --> 03:30:10.520]  double or triple your electric bill number two
[03:30:10.520 --> 03:30:14.360]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[03:30:14.360 --> 03:30:17.560]  allows you to have it's true total government control of
[03:30:17.560 --> 03:30:21.080]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[03:30:21.080 --> 03:30:24.760]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[03:30:24.760 --> 03:30:27.720]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[03:30:27.720 --> 03:30:31.640]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[03:30:31.640 --> 03:30:34.760]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[03:30:34.760 --> 03:30:38.200]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[03:30:38.200 --> 03:30:41.560]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[03:30:41.560 --> 03:30:44.440]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[03:31:17.160 --> 03:31:21.560]  on our president and congress and they really are calling the shots i think
[03:31:21.560 --> 03:31:26.440]  it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[03:31:26.440 --> 03:31:29.640]  fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[03:31:29.640 --> 03:31:34.040]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty

[03:34:50.840 --> 03:34:54.360]  jones dot to your going back to the member of the icelandic parliament one
[03:34:54.360 --> 03:34:56.600]  of the main leaders successfully getting this
[03:34:56.600 --> 03:35:01.080]  referendum through how excited are the people about this referendum
[03:35:01.080 --> 03:35:06.680]  and how is the establishment the banking cartel uh striking back
[03:35:06.680 --> 03:35:11.560]  well people are very happy it was our first national referendum it was a
[03:35:11.560 --> 03:35:17.400]  historical day and uh we had a little get-together
[03:35:17.400 --> 03:35:24.600]  on the saturday night and it was the mood was fantastic and in general i really
[03:35:24.600 --> 03:35:29.480]  hope that we can keep the spirit of the nation joining together and we need to
[03:35:29.480 --> 03:35:35.240]  move that ambience into parliament and into the government as well so that
[03:35:35.240 --> 03:35:39.800]  they carry on the the message from the nation
[03:35:39.800 --> 03:35:44.120]  the bankers haven't really said much right now
[03:35:44.120 --> 03:35:48.200]  i guess that they are planning the next strike
[03:35:48.200 --> 03:35:51.800]  however they're using the british and dutch government
[03:35:51.800 --> 03:35:56.040]  in their favor and it was a bit sad that our
[03:35:56.040 --> 03:36:00.040]  democratically elected prime minister decided to sit home
[03:36:00.040 --> 03:36:05.720]  sulking instead of participate in this historical moment and despite her doing
[03:36:05.720 --> 03:36:09.480]  that and thus giving a strong message to the
[03:36:09.480 --> 03:36:13.640]  biggest party in iceland people decided to go out and vote anyway
[03:36:13.640 --> 03:36:19.640]  um but there are very many exciting things happening in iceland such as
[03:36:19.640 --> 03:36:24.200]  uh we just spoke for our proposal uh called uh which we call the icelandic
[03:36:24.200 --> 03:36:27.880]  modern media initiative which has gained worldwide attention
[03:36:27.880 --> 03:36:32.920]  where we're suggesting that iceland will take the lead in
[03:36:32.920 --> 03:36:38.200]  the freedom of speech freedom of information and
[03:36:38.200 --> 03:36:42.120]  freedom of expression by actually modernizing and pooling together the
[03:36:42.120 --> 03:36:45.880]  best possible legislation to protect sources
[03:36:45.880 --> 03:36:49.560]  journalists whistleblowers publishers and
[03:36:49.560 --> 03:36:55.400]  ips isp hosts in order to get that information out to the general
[03:36:55.400 --> 03:36:58.760]  public in fact i have the article right here
[03:36:58.760 --> 03:37:04.120]  icelandic modern media initiative saying the west is moving in europe england
[03:37:04.120 --> 03:37:07.320]  the u.s and canada and australia to censor the
[03:37:07.320 --> 03:37:11.240]  internet to shut down free speech wired magazine last week at the
[03:37:11.240 --> 03:37:14.520]  headline cyber security the end of the open internet
[03:37:14.520 --> 03:37:18.360]  this is really happening and so now uh you guys are moving to say look we'll
[03:37:18.360 --> 03:37:21.560]  allow wiki leaks to be here we'll allow independent journalism
[03:37:21.560 --> 03:37:25.320]  we want people to move here and come here and put their servers here
[03:37:25.320 --> 03:37:29.640]  really as an information revolution the people are finding the power they have
[03:37:29.640 --> 03:37:33.080]  to say no to the banks and this is really growing
[03:37:33.080 --> 03:37:37.400]  yeah and you know i really hope that it uh i mean it's
[03:37:37.400 --> 03:37:41.720]  for some reason icelanders are right now a bit shy about the
[03:37:41.720 --> 03:37:45.320]  uh placing themselves as doing anything that would be considered
[03:37:45.320 --> 03:37:47.880]  the best they don't want to fall in the same pit
[03:37:47.880 --> 03:37:51.640]  uh so i guess the most skeptical people about this uh
[03:37:51.640 --> 03:37:56.600]  proposal are icelanders uh we however managed to get all the parties in iceland
[03:37:56.600 --> 03:38:03.160]  on this um and uh three party chair leaders um
[03:38:03.160 --> 03:38:06.600]  so i'm actually quite optimistic that we can pass this through the parliament
[03:38:06.600 --> 03:38:10.680]  uh we're basically proposing or tasking the government to take on this
[03:38:10.680 --> 03:38:15.800]  challenge because it requires a lot of legislative legislative changes
[03:38:15.800 --> 03:38:19.640]  uh but um you know in general it's been
[03:38:19.640 --> 03:38:23.480]  overwhelming the support we've got from all over the world
[03:38:23.480 --> 03:38:27.000]  and now Greece and Spain and countless others are going to try to
[03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:30.760]  follow your example this is a true revolution against the global banking
[03:38:30.760 --> 03:38:33.400]  dictatorship attempting to establish open world
[03:38:33.400 --> 03:38:37.320]  government and tyranny i've got some uh questions here from our twitter
[03:38:37.320 --> 03:38:41.720]  page uh and again it is a uh repeat of
[03:38:41.720 --> 03:38:46.600]  some of the things i've been asking about what are the consequences of not
[03:38:46.600 --> 03:38:52.120]  conforming we just dropped our video connection to her we'll get her back
[03:38:52.120 --> 03:38:54.520]  and we're going to go through some of these uh questions for her and your
[03:38:54.520 --> 03:38:59.000]  phone calls as soon as we get her back up uh you know we try to bring a lot of
[03:38:59.000 --> 03:39:02.600]  the guests via video connection plus it has better audio connection on skype
[03:39:02.600 --> 03:39:05.960]  but there are some problems when they're in them on an island in the middle of
[03:39:05.960 --> 03:39:09.960]  the atlantic obviously but we're going to uh
[03:39:09.960 --> 03:39:13.400]  get into some of that you know what are the consequences of not conforming to
[03:39:13.400 --> 03:39:17.880]  EU demands finance minister stein groomer
[03:39:17.880 --> 03:39:21.160]  a no vote does not mean we are refusing to pay
[03:39:21.160 --> 03:39:24.200]  what are her thoughts on his statements we'll find out those that statement's
[03:39:24.200 --> 03:39:28.520]  true and what her take on that is also what could anti-war and
[03:39:28.520 --> 03:39:33.000]  anti-debt slavery movements learn from the success of the movement
[03:39:33.000 --> 03:39:37.640]  party in iceland and so those are some of the questions will also
[03:39:37.640 --> 03:39:42.520]  go to live questions from listeners don't forget that you
[03:39:42.520 --> 03:39:46.520]  can't not only just listen to us on am and fm dial a lot of new affiliates

[03:40:23.080 --> 03:40:27.400]  tyranny okay uh brg to going back to you
[03:40:27.400 --> 03:40:32.200]  here's a twitter question from e nine adam what's the consequences of not
[03:40:32.200 --> 03:40:35.800]  conforming to e u demands
[03:40:35.800 --> 03:40:43.560]  well there's been a lot of dunes day consequences you know scenarios
[03:40:43.560 --> 03:40:51.160]  told to the nation and i seriously have a feeling because of this very strong
[03:40:51.160 --> 03:40:55.800]  signal from the aslantic nation and actually a very little interest
[03:40:55.800 --> 03:41:01.080]  among the nation to join the e u that there was actually a statement made by
[03:41:01.080 --> 03:41:06.200]  the the chief of the e u application procedure saying
[03:41:06.200 --> 03:41:11.480]  that the uk netherlands and island should not be
[03:41:11.480 --> 03:41:14.680]  you know the application not be interfered with
[03:41:14.680 --> 03:41:18.760]  in a court you know despite so so so first they were threatening
[03:41:18.760 --> 03:41:22.040]  to not let you in now that you don't want and they're saying oh no go ahead and
[03:41:22.040 --> 03:41:25.960]  come in we want to rob you like grease here's another question
[03:41:25.960 --> 03:41:29.320]  it's and have you heard this statement is it accurate
[03:41:29.320 --> 03:41:34.280]  finance minister stein groomer about pronouncing that right setting no vote
[03:41:34.280 --> 03:41:39.960]  does not mean we're refusing to pay what are your thoughts on his statements
[03:41:39.960 --> 03:41:45.320]  um sometimes it really surprises me what he says
[03:41:45.320 --> 03:41:50.440]  uh it is as if he is working for the british and the dutch not us
[03:41:50.440 --> 03:41:55.320]  so he did say that well he did say that and uh
[03:41:55.320 --> 03:42:00.600]  however let us not forget that the the bank in question actually has a
[03:42:00.600 --> 03:42:05.480]  sustainable amount of assets that can be recovered
[03:42:05.480 --> 03:42:09.400]  and so far what the british and the dutch can claim in it
[03:42:09.400 --> 03:42:12.840]  will actually be recovered by at least 88 percent
[03:42:12.840 --> 03:42:16.360]  yeah that was in the times of london they claim that you all owed him 20 plus
[03:42:16.360 --> 03:42:19.720]  thousand dollars every individual and they had to take over all your
[03:42:19.720 --> 03:42:23.560]  infrastructure now they go guess what we don't even need that money we already
[03:42:23.560 --> 03:42:27.720]  had the asset so it was a giant just like the banks here that have robbed us
[03:42:27.720 --> 03:42:32.360]  are all recording record profits the same banks that are trying to rob
[03:42:32.360 --> 03:42:36.760]  you i mean that is such a key point that it turns out that they had the assets
[03:42:36.760 --> 03:42:40.280]  to begin with yeah and the thing is that they actually
[03:42:40.280 --> 03:42:44.040]  decided uh or darling the financial manager of the
[03:42:44.040 --> 03:42:47.480]  uk he decided to move money within his own ministry and then
[03:42:47.480 --> 03:42:53.480]  earmark some of it or you know 700 billion islantic to the islantic nation
[03:42:53.480 --> 03:42:56.920]  uh and then expect us to pay full interest
[03:42:56.920 --> 03:43:00.600]  really high interest of that uh i mean it is
[03:43:00.600 --> 03:43:05.400]  a brilliant scheme but we will not do it we will that's another exactly your
[03:43:05.400 --> 03:43:07.960]  wise to it americans should get wise as well
[03:43:07.960 --> 03:43:11.480]  the collapse of iceland was a private matter why do they want the people to
[03:43:11.480 --> 03:43:16.760]  pay it is a question from resist archipelago
[03:43:16.760 --> 03:43:22.120]  well i mean in general like every time you look at
[03:43:22.120 --> 03:43:27.400]  how the imf functions and i was actually reading a secret document leak to
[03:43:27.400 --> 03:43:31.800]  vicki leaks which is a brilliant source if you want to sort of dig deeper into
[03:43:31.800 --> 03:43:37.160]  the real conspiracies of our world and it was a manual from the
[03:43:37.160 --> 03:43:44.200]  the military sector in the u.s talking about unconventional warfare and
[03:43:44.200 --> 03:43:49.480]  in the unconventional warfare the section about financial warfare
[03:43:49.480 --> 03:43:52.600]  they talk about the imf as one of their choice
[03:43:52.600 --> 03:43:59.000]  weapons uh so you know i encourage people to study how the imf functions
[03:43:59.000 --> 03:44:02.920]  exactly it's a private consortium for blowing out countries
[03:44:02.920 --> 03:44:07.480]  and the banks are attacking america this is a criminal group let's go to some
[03:44:07.480 --> 03:44:10.600]  phone calls rick and arizona you're on the air with the
[03:44:10.600 --> 03:44:14.040]  pergita jones dotier one of the main leaders in parliament defeating the
[03:44:14.040 --> 03:44:19.000]  scumbag banks go ahead rick uh... yes thank both of you for fighting for
[03:44:19.000 --> 03:44:22.040]  freedom appreciate it uh... i have a question that
[03:44:22.040 --> 03:44:25.480]  uh... has to do with one of your uh... twitter questions
[03:44:25.480 --> 03:44:29.400]  about uh... uh... i don't know if you have to visit a president that runs
[03:44:29.400 --> 03:44:33.800]  iceland that's the leader of iceland and they call him a president or
[03:44:33.800 --> 03:44:37.080]  uh... we have a president uh... then we have uh...
[03:44:37.080 --> 03:44:42.440]  which is doesn't really have a lot of power uh... but the main power lies with
[03:44:42.440 --> 03:44:46.200]  the prime minister of iceland and the finance minister they sort of co
[03:44:46.200 --> 03:44:51.800]  co-shared their power okay well here's the subject that i have here is uh
[03:44:51.800 --> 03:44:54.840]  for alex also uh... i don't know if you're uh...
[03:44:54.840 --> 03:44:59.080]  staff that watched the whole benedict back last night
[03:44:59.080 --> 03:45:03.800]  uh... but at the end of his show he was discussing the ninety three percent
[03:45:03.800 --> 03:45:08.440]  uh... voted no to pay it back in the one percent uh... voted for it
[03:45:08.440 --> 03:45:13.080]  and then at the end of uh... that part of the segment he did mention that the
[03:45:13.080 --> 03:45:16.040]  leader of iceland said that they will repay it
[03:45:16.040 --> 03:45:20.520]  and i was he's saying this is good because he supported the banker bailout
[03:45:20.520 --> 03:45:24.600]  yeah i i don't know if uh... if they i mean he always flip-flops and he's
[03:45:24.600 --> 03:45:27.720]  calling for new taxes to pay the bankers value-added
[03:45:27.720 --> 03:45:32.920]  uh... vat was i mean did beck imply it was bad that iceland said no
[03:45:32.920 --> 03:45:36.840]  no he did not imply that but he's he he did mention that the leader of iceland
[03:45:36.840 --> 03:45:39.880]  said that they will pay it anyway and he was just kind of you know
[03:45:39.880 --> 03:45:44.360]  and so i don't know if he was doing a flip-flop so was he supportive of iceland
[03:45:44.360 --> 03:45:47.480]  he was supportive of their vote yes but good for him
[03:45:47.480 --> 03:45:51.320]  good for him i saw him do some good work last friday i mean i want to like
[03:45:51.320 --> 03:45:55.320]  glen back it's just that uh... i appreciate your call herman in new york
[03:45:55.320 --> 03:45:58.920]  you're on the air with uh... miss jones dot here
[03:45:58.920 --> 03:46:02.840]  dot just a little out of memory yes sir
[03:46:02.840 --> 03:46:07.480]  yet uh... i have a question and comment uh... i don't know my comment first
[03:46:07.480 --> 03:46:11.320]  i did you i see the article about how the uh... state
[03:46:11.320 --> 03:46:16.120]  might not be returning uh... some of the illegal tax money that they are
[03:46:16.120 --> 03:46:19.080]  citizens u.s. citizens are paying to the bankers
[03:46:19.080 --> 03:46:23.400]  that they may actually hold it on due to their state deficit
[03:46:23.400 --> 03:46:27.480]  absolutely and now they're saying all that uh... tax return
[03:46:27.480 --> 03:46:31.240]  that obama was going to give you now most of you won't get it but that's a
[03:46:31.240 --> 03:46:33.800]  i'm gonna let you go herman because i think these are questions for our
[03:46:33.800 --> 03:46:36.040]  guest here she's here especially for this
[03:46:36.040 --> 03:46:39.480]  uh... cody in washington you're on the air go ahead
[03:46:39.480 --> 03:46:43.320]  i think uh... i just want to say i love iceland by the way the music culture
[03:46:43.320 --> 03:46:48.040]  the people and everything and uh... uh... my question is is uh...
[03:46:48.040 --> 03:46:51.640]  what what would you suggest if you could uh...
[03:46:51.640 --> 03:46:56.040]  that we as citizens could do uh... who were born into this corrupt system
[03:46:56.040 --> 03:46:59.240]  uh... what can we do to make a change like you guys are in iceland you know
[03:46:59.240 --> 03:47:03.320]  to stand up uh... to our you know you know they got involved
[03:47:03.320 --> 03:47:07.800]  they got educated they took action uh... burguita comments on what he just said
[03:47:07.800 --> 03:47:12.360]  how do we mimic and learn from your success
[03:47:12.360 --> 03:47:16.200]  uh... exactly like i said just just going to it i mean we had eight weeks
[03:47:16.200 --> 03:47:19.240]  before election uh... we had no money
[03:47:19.240 --> 03:47:23.240]  uh... but we used the internet we used uh...
[03:47:23.240 --> 03:47:27.720]  all reasons we possibly can do and we went and talked to people everywhere and
[03:47:27.720 --> 03:47:31.320]  uh... and basically because people were hungry for change
[03:47:31.320 --> 03:47:36.120]  uh... you you could involve so many people what we decided to do was not to
[03:47:36.120 --> 03:47:40.920]  hang our agenda on left or right politics we decided to have an agenda at
[03:47:40.920 --> 03:47:45.320]  a checklist sort of a hit-and-run uh... movement that would go
[03:47:45.320 --> 03:47:49.160]  inside for example the parliament and try to implement real changes there
[03:47:49.160 --> 03:47:53.800]  it's simple you didn't know the money and you're not going to pay it
[03:47:53.800 --> 03:47:57.320]  exactly we never got any of this money when it comes to isaac
[03:47:57.320 --> 03:48:01.080]  uh... why should we pay it why so why are the american people giving twenty eight
[03:48:01.080 --> 03:48:06.360]  trillion to the banks cody thanks andy in florida you're on the air
[03:48:06.360 --> 03:48:09.080]  hi uh... well i was always the home to
[03:48:09.080 --> 03:48:11.960]  figure out now seems to be the home to freedom
[03:48:11.960 --> 03:48:15.960]  and i just want to say that i've known a lot of islamic people and i i think that
[03:48:15.960 --> 03:48:20.760]  we as uh... as as people who travel we should visit islam and help support them
[03:48:20.760 --> 03:48:24.120]  just wondering if we go there i know there were issues with our credit cards
[03:48:24.120 --> 03:48:27.640]  being honored in iceland just wondering what are these like the day-to-day effects
[03:48:27.640 --> 03:48:32.520]  that icelanders are feeling from the yeah tell us what the i mean there was food
[03:48:32.520 --> 03:48:35.480]  shortages everything break it down
[03:48:35.480 --> 03:48:40.680]  well uh... we have all the sort of credit lines opened again uh... and uh...
[03:48:40.680 --> 03:48:43.720]  because it's a relatively small system it was uh...
[03:48:43.720 --> 03:48:48.200]  we could quite quickly recover uh... or get back on track
[03:48:48.200 --> 03:48:52.040]  uh... there are no problems with any cards now or anything like that so
[03:48:52.040 --> 03:48:56.360]  you can easily use your american credit card in iceland or any credit card
[03:48:56.360 --> 03:49:01.320]  uh... what the big problem we're facing now is that
[03:49:01.320 --> 03:49:04.920]  you know before the collapse we had like one percent unemployment
[03:49:04.920 --> 03:49:08.360]  uh... in one month it showed up to ten percent and i would be with
[03:49:08.360 --> 03:49:12.680]  something around fourteen percent uh... and people are
[03:49:12.680 --> 03:49:17.640]  you know facing foreclosures and the government isn't really
[03:49:17.640 --> 03:49:22.760]  are capable of uh... dealing with these problems because we were within this
[03:49:22.760 --> 03:49:25.400]  IMF program and they're keeping uh...
[03:49:25.400 --> 03:49:30.360]  the interest rates really high uh... which is a total fail in a situation like
[03:49:30.360 --> 03:49:34.360]  this where the interest rate should be similar as your interest rates
[03:49:34.360 --> 03:49:39.000]  almost zero uh... so we are
[03:49:39.000 --> 03:49:42.680]  just you know before like in 2007 we were ranked
[03:49:42.680 --> 03:49:47.160]  uh... according to the UN standard that as the
[03:49:47.160 --> 03:49:50.440]  most developed nation in the world there is like one of the richest nations in
[03:49:50.440 --> 03:49:53.800]  the world uh... so this is a huge leap in a really short
[03:49:53.800 --> 03:49:58.200]  period of time and uh... there is a massive exodus there's a lot of people
[03:49:58.200 --> 03:50:01.480]  moving away from Iceland because they see no hope being here
[03:50:01.480 --> 03:50:05.160]  and i think it is critical to stop that exodus
[03:50:05.160 --> 03:50:08.840]  uh... and to try to find a common vision among the Icelandic people
[03:50:08.840 --> 03:50:12.520]  absolutely i mean we see how the banks destroy societies
[03:50:12.520 --> 03:50:16.840]  first world the only first world country in latin america argentina has been
[03:50:16.840 --> 03:50:21.480]  destroyed by them and uh... we see them holding you hostage
[03:50:21.480 --> 03:50:24.680]  cutting off the credit cards cutting off the trade
[03:50:24.680 --> 03:50:28.040]  trying to force you into submission but you said no
[03:50:28.040 --> 03:50:31.240]  so it is important for people to support what you're doing we're going to come
[03:50:31.240 --> 03:50:34.040]  back in a final segment with our guest
[03:50:34.040 --> 03:50:37.720]  earlier this morning i got a call from
