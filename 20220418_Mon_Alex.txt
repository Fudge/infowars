[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:31.000 --> 00:41.000]  Social media from the CCP rarely ever makes its way into American pop culture.
[00:41.000 --> 00:51.000]  But in early 2020, they went viral with radical videos of forced quarantines and sealing people into their own dwellings with welding torches.
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.000]  Were Americans shown all this to make our own lockdowns seem less devastating?
[00:57.000 --> 01:03.000]  And if so, what are we to make of the new social media blitz coming out of Shanghai?
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.000]  People are being starved in their own homes.
[01:06.000 --> 01:09.000]  Their pets are being killed.
[01:09.000 --> 01:19.000]  And it's getting so hellish that suicide is seemingly an everyday part of life now in Shanghai.
[01:19.000 --> 01:26.000]  Just because things are feeling a bit more liberating in America doesn't mean the lockdowns are over.
[01:26.000 --> 01:32.000]  How in the hell are these Democrats going to win an election without another lockdown?
[01:32.000 --> 01:38.000]  They are already setting up the narrative and have invested in new mobile testing machines.
[01:38.000 --> 01:49.000]  If you think Trump is somehow going to save you, even though he helped in the last lockdown and proudly gave birth to the deadly vaccines, he just sided with Dr. Oz.
[01:49.000 --> 02:00.000]  The way I endorse another person today, Dr. Oz in Pennsylvania. Dr. Oz. Great guy, good man, good man, Harvard educated.
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.000]  And Dr. Oz loves the CCP lockdown model.
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.000]  And the Chinese numbers have dropped dramatically, which is fantastic news.
[02:08.000 --> 02:11.000]  And it's also valuable for us to understand why they were able to do that.
[02:11.000 --> 02:21.000]  If you look inside of Wuhan province, they had a catastrophe. But outside the province, which of course they quarantined in the largest movement of its nature ever, 60 million people blocked in that space.
[02:21.000 --> 02:27.000]  But the rest of the country was relatively spare. They didn't have the big spikes, the huge crises that Wuhan experienced.
[02:27.000 --> 02:34.000]  And it took the country to a very different direction. We just have to copy what they did, take their blueprint and repeat it here in this country.
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  And we started that aggressively over the last week.
[02:37.000 --> 02:49.000]  In trauma-based mind control, the abuser alternates between abuse and comfort, which forms a bond with the victim, known in pop culture as Stockholm syndrome.
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  This might not work on you, but they are not doing it for you.
[02:53.000 --> 03:02.000]  They want the majority on their side when they start arresting people like you for forced vaccination, and of course, gun confiscation.
[03:02.000 --> 03:16.000]  Well, China has a number of problems, two of which are that their complete lockdown, which was their approach, a strictest lockdown that you'd never be able to implement in the United States.
[03:16.000 --> 03:26.000]  Although that prevents the spread of infection, I remember early on they were saying, and I think accurately, that they were doing better than almost anybody else.
[03:26.000 --> 03:33.000]  But lockdown has its consequences. You use lockdowns to get people vaccinated.
[03:33.000 --> 03:59.000]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[03:59.000 --> 04:12.000]  A bioweapon release could be the thing they'd release to bring in a world government to counter a global problem, and the UN has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government.
[04:12.000 --> 04:19.000]  This is a biological warfare agent that had leaked out of the Wuhan laboratory.
[04:19.000 --> 04:38.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[04:38.000 --> 05:01.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[05:01.000 --> 05:14.000]  Over the years, InfoWars has produced more than 200 amazing, patriot, Americana, Second Amendment pro-liberty themed t-shirts, ball caps, flags, you name it.
[05:14.000 --> 05:20.000]  All of the apparel and the flags are being sold at cost right now. That's just regular plain chain shirts.
[05:20.000 --> 05:31.000]  That is all sorts of designer shirts that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce. We used to sell for $40, we're selling them for $15, selling them for $20, whatever the shirt costs us.
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.000]  If a shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5 for us to actually produce.
[05:35.000 --> 05:47.000]  If it costs $10, we're selling it for $10. And we've got hoodies, and we've got long sleeves, and we've got short sleeves, we've got them all, and we've got to liquidate them all, and they're limited edition, because we're never going to make any of these designs.
[05:47.000 --> 05:53.000]  Again, we are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited, limited edition in the future.
[05:53.000 --> 05:58.000]  We've got to sell this to keep InfoWars on the air, plus it spreads the word, InfoWarsStore.com.
[05:58.000 --> 06:11.000]  Here's historic apparel now, InfoWarsStore.com.
[06:11.000 --> 06:20.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:20.000 --> 06:28.000]  So here we are on this Monday, April 18th edition of the Alex Jones show in the year 2022.
[06:28.000 --> 06:46.000]  And we see worldwide depression, we see worldwide inflation, we see planetary starvation, we see massive wars, we see collapsing borders, we see open pedophilia promotion by every major western media outlet of any size.
[06:46.000 --> 07:01.000]  It is just an unspeakable moment in human history to know that we've been turned over to evil, that we've aborted billions of babies on a planetary scale, and that God is now withdrawing his protection from us.
[07:01.000 --> 07:07.000]  And evil and corruption is being allowed to absolutely run rampant.
[07:07.000 --> 07:18.000]  Alright, I'm going to say something here, and I'm not going to talk about it again today, and it will be basically my statement on the subject that I'm going to move on.
[07:18.000 --> 07:31.000]  But it's just this, I am not declaring bankruptcy, and InfoWars is not declaring bankruptcy, it's a Chapter 11 reorganization in the federal courts.
[07:31.000 --> 07:41.000]  So you can go and show them their books, they can come in and look at your books, and know that we don't have 16 million in a secret bank account, or 5 million, or 3 million.
[07:41.000 --> 07:51.000]  And know that what has been claimed by the Texas courts that are very political and the Connecticut court is not correct and is not true.
[07:51.000 --> 08:03.000]  And whether that's successful or not, in the long term, this will be an issue for the bankruptcy courts one way or another, and it's just time for that to happen.
[08:03.000 --> 08:11.000]  And it's time for people to be able to see that I don't have 5 million dollars, I don't have 3 million dollars.
[08:11.000 --> 08:18.000]  We have less than 3 million dollars cash, and we need that money to buy future product to be able to operate.
[08:18.000 --> 08:21.000]  So I'm essentially making no money, which is fine.
[08:21.000 --> 08:34.000]  The whole purpose of this place was not for Alex Jones to make a bunch of money, but it takes a bunch of money to run an independent, self-sufficient media operation with 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 million people a day,
[08:34.000 --> 08:38.000]  watching and listening just in bandwidth alone, and this great crew.
[08:38.000 --> 08:45.000]  And we are what the establishment fears, real independent media giving a system a run for its money.
[08:45.000 --> 08:53.000]  And so when you see all these headlines out there, did Alex Jones afford to declare bankruptcy? The answer is no.
[08:53.000 --> 08:59.000]  The bankruptcy phenomenon, my affiliate companies, is designed to pay all of my creditors in full.
[08:59.000 --> 09:08.000]  Alex Jones, yours truly gave up all rights to his membership interest in the debtor's bankruptcy to a trust created to hold that interest and backstop payments and claims.
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.000]  Number four, I'm confident the federal system has the tools and experience to fairly deal with the resolution of these claims.
[09:14.000 --> 09:23.000]  Now, here's what's important. Again, the corporate media and these individuals know that we don't have all this money.
[09:23.000 --> 09:34.000]  The plan is to try to get judgments that are giant and large, that can't be paid, so they can close our doors here and try to keep me from being on the air elsewhere, which they're not going to be able to do.
[09:34.000 --> 09:40.000]  In fact, if anything, it makes me work harder and value the first amendment even more.
[09:40.000 --> 09:50.000]  That said, my fate is tied to your fate, and this country and this world is in a lot of trouble.
[09:50.000 --> 10:03.000]  And so we're all going to share in this misery together, including those that are in the system and that are really destroying due process and every major pillar of our bill of rights and Constitution.
[10:03.000 --> 10:16.000]  I mean, the eighth amendment in my case is completely thrown out the window, and I'm not going to get into this today in any great detail, but this is a big story for anybody in the country.
[10:16.000 --> 10:24.000]  And I've talked to a lot of lawyers, including some of the biggest names out there, and they've seen these documents, and they cannot believe these.
[10:24.000 --> 10:50.000]  But the judges given in the Texas case and the Connecticut case, whatever these lawyers want, same lawyers that bankrupted Remington and Dipp, serious problems, have filed for one of three trials they have coming up starting next month, actually late this month, that we not be able to talk at the trial.
[10:50.000 --> 10:59.000]  So I've already found guilty, the juries ever think that they would go and then someone's guilty, you're told, and now you decide how guilty?
[10:59.000 --> 11:04.000]  That would be a judge usually, a jury would decide, and the judge would have some oversight on how guilty.
[11:04.000 --> 11:11.000]  And it actually says in here, cannot mention the first amendment, cannot defend yourself. It actually says it in here.
[11:11.000 --> 11:34.000]  This is a big story, and I don't feel sorry for myself, I feel sorry for the country. I am shocked by the level of depravity that is just widespread in this country, in the bureaucracies, in government, and in the legal system.
[11:34.000 --> 11:45.000]  And this country has cancer, and so this is like learning you have cancer, and it just is what it is, but it's not just Alex Jones that has political cancer, spiritual cancer, we all do.
[11:45.000 --> 11:56.000]  The rot that is attacking us is endemic of what has happened in civilization, and it just tears my guts out.
[11:56.000 --> 12:05.000]  I can tell you this, if we weren't so maxed out, these legal battles would be a lot easier.
[12:05.000 --> 12:15.000]  And so the biggest thing you can do is spread the word about the broadcasts and knowing that powerful forces are doing everything they can and breaking all the rules, try to silence us,
[12:15.000 --> 12:30.000]  because they need the main voices of resistance silenced ahead of the next big lockdowns, and the devaluation of the currency, and the universal basic income, and the real tyranny that is being shut up and rolled out now.
[12:30.000 --> 12:38.000]  And so I'm honored that these powerful forces are obsessed with taking us down and silencing us. I mean, I expect that to happen, it's still amazing to actually be at the center of it.
[12:38.000 --> 12:51.000]  And so there's that. Please spread the word about the broadcasts and realize it's so precious, and every guess we have, and every topic we cover, and the information we go over is something that really scares the power structure because they know it's the truth.
[12:51.000 --> 12:59.000]  Also financially support in full wars. The individuals doing all this don't want to get money.
[12:59.000 --> 13:09.000]  They want to get charging orders to just come and close the doors and shut down the warehouse and shut down the shopping cart and physically fire all these employees. That's the stated admitted goal.
[13:09.000 --> 13:23.000]  Obviously, I'll be able to stay on air. I'll be able to limitately do what I've been doing, but all the Greg Reese reports and the Christie Lee reports and the Jeremy Green reports and all the things you've seen over the years and those things that really are so hardcore and so special in the films and all of it,
[13:23.000 --> 13:39.000]  that will be further crippled and that will be a big victory for the establishment. So I mean, I would tell you right now, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want us to be able to stay on air and be able to move forward in the future, I need you now to not wait.
[13:39.000 --> 13:53.000]  And to go to infowarstore.com, especially those of you that have never bought a book, never bought a film, never bought a t-shirt, never got a supplement, never got an air filtration, water filtration, shortwave radio, thousands of great items, books, you name it, at infowarstore.com.
[13:53.000 --> 14:02.000]  Get your living defense. Get your knockout. It's back in stock. Body's ultimate turmeric formula, lung cleanse. They're all there at infowarstore.com.
[14:02.000 --> 14:14.000]  And it's just that simple. There's also a button up on the top of the shopping cart that says support and it says become a sponsor and you just click there and you can give a monthly donation or just give a one-time donation.
[14:14.000 --> 14:21.000]  And then we actually get 95% of that money instead of just, you know, 30 or 40%, 50% with the sale of the product.
[14:21.000 --> 14:32.000]  So this is do or die time. If you want to keep us on air through these attacks of the system and the system pulling out all the stops to try to silence us, then this is the time.
[14:32.000 --> 14:39.000]  They are trying to silence you. They are trying to take down the leading voice of resistance.
[14:39.000 --> 14:48.000]  So I simply need you to go to infowarstore.com or call toll-free, triple-A-253-3139.
[14:48.000 --> 14:55.000]  And also, I'm going to add a little link so you can donate to InfoWars right under the live show feed today or maybe even above it.
[14:55.000 --> 15:01.000]  I'll say donate to InfoWars to help us defend the First Amendment and stop the globalist program.
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  We're going to put a link directly to the shopping cart.
[15:04.000 --> 15:11.000]  And I mean, we're already totally maxed out and I am expending my backup capital.
[15:11.000 --> 15:19.000]  And I am very honored to do that except when I run out of that, that'll be it. I'll have to start laying people off and cutting stuff.
[15:19.000 --> 15:32.000]  And again, the other side knows that and they just want us to silence because they do not like the topics we cover and what we do and how we stand up to this takeover, this bullying that we're all witnessing.
[15:32.000 --> 15:42.000]  So again, infowarstore.com and for some reason we hide the hell out of the link to donate. So I'll add a banner at the top of infowarstore.com right now.
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.000]  So you can also go right to the donate button, but we need your support now.
[15:46.000 --> 15:53.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com or triple-A-253-3139.
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  There's a lot of treachery and a lot of e-ball out there, but there's also a lot of good.
[15:56.000 --> 16:03.000]  So thank you for your support. We need your help.
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  We're selling them for $15, selling them for $20, whatever the shirt costs.
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.000]  If a shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5 for essentially produce.
[16:34.000 --> 16:36.000]  If it costs $10, we're selling it for $10.
[16:36.000 --> 16:40.000]  And we've got hoodies and we've got long sleeves and we've got short sleeves.
[16:40.000 --> 16:47.000]  We've got them all and we've got to liquidate them all and they're limited edition because we're never going to make any of these designs again.
[16:47.000 --> 16:52.000]  We are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited and limited edition in the future.
[16:52.000 --> 17:00.000]  We've got to sell this to keep info wars on the air plus it spreads the word infowarstore.com to your historic apparel now infowarstore.com.
[17:00.000 --> 17:05.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help. I need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong.
[17:05.000 --> 17:09.000]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[17:09.000 --> 17:14.000]  I was born for this. You were born for this and people are really waking up right now,
[17:14.000 --> 17:21.000]  but we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[17:21.000 --> 17:25.000]  And now with Band-Aid video getting close to 10 million views a day,
[17:25.000 --> 17:33.000]  we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge.
[17:33.000 --> 17:37.000]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[17:37.000 --> 17:43.000]  Info wars and Band-Aid video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide,
[17:43.000 --> 17:50.000]  but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[17:50.000 --> 17:53.000]  So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now.
[17:53.000 --> 18:00.000]  The mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off getting credible products and keep info wars as strong as ever.
[18:00.000 --> 18:05.000]  The newest product from info wars life is now available exclusively at infowarstore.com.

[18:13.000 --> 18:15.000]  All at the same time, funding the info war.
[18:15.000 --> 18:21.000]  Our immune systems have always been critical, but in this globalist era, with all the criminal activity they're involved in,
[18:21.000 --> 18:26.000]  it is more important than ever to take the tools God gave us and supercharge our immune systems.
[18:26.000 --> 18:30.000]  Info wars life immune support is a game changer.

[19:20.000 --> 19:27.000]  Superbile Vitality really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[19:27.000 --> 19:34.000]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[19:34.000 --> 19:38.000]  This is like a very fine wine. In fact, each batch is different.
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay.
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  That's just how it is. It's how it works.
[19:45.000 --> 19:50.000]  So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[19:50.000 --> 19:54.000]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[19:54.000 --> 20:19.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[20:19.000 --> 20:37.000]  Info Wars is not going down without a fight and the system knows that.
[20:37.000 --> 20:41.000]  And so they pulled out all the stops. Welcome back to Alex Jones show.
[20:41.000 --> 20:48.000]  You know, we've just recently seen calls for Diane Feinstein to step down
[20:48.000 --> 20:50.000]  because she's so seen Alan can barely talk.
[20:50.000 --> 20:54.000]  But when you actually see her give a speech, she has more cognitive ability
[20:54.000 --> 20:59.000]  than Ruth Bader Ginsburg did before she died or Joe Biden.
[20:59.000 --> 21:02.000]  So why do they want her gone?
[21:02.000 --> 21:07.000]  That's interesting question. She is a Chinese double agent on record.
[21:07.000 --> 21:12.000]  But this is just emblematic of the rotting establishment that we have that's in control.
[21:12.000 --> 21:18.000]  But look at some of these headlines. The Washington Post with the sub headline
[21:18.000 --> 21:24.000]  democracy dies in darkness says it's time to give the elites a bigger say
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  in choosing the president, the elites.
[21:28.000 --> 21:33.000]  But then when Elon Musk wants to buy Twitter for free speech, he's a danger to the world.
[21:33.000 --> 21:38.000]  Here's another one real clear policy time to give elites a bigger say
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  in choosing the president, Washington Post.
[21:42.000 --> 21:46.000]  To save democracy, we need a few good dictators.
[21:46.000 --> 21:56.000]  That's out of Bloomberg. We need to get rid of freedom.
[21:56.000 --> 21:59.000]  To save democracy, we need a few good dictators.
[21:59.000 --> 22:04.000]  We just showed the Financial Times of London headline is almost the same.
[22:04.000 --> 22:10.000]  Think about that. And you've got Harari, Noah Harari, the spokesperson
[22:10.000 --> 22:15.000]  for the Debo script, saying the end of humans is here.
[22:15.000 --> 22:17.000]  We're going to force the end of humans. Humans are bad.
[22:17.000 --> 22:23.000]  AI is taking you over. We're colonizing your body through the vaccines right now with nanotech.
[22:23.000 --> 22:27.000]  And then we point out he's saying that and they go, oh, you're crazy. It doesn't exist.
[22:27.000 --> 22:31.000]  You need to be silenced. You are discrediting the power structure.
[22:31.000 --> 22:38.000]  Why would anyone, especially folks with children, go along with this?
[22:38.000 --> 22:41.000]  Why would anyone accept headlines everywhere?
[22:41.000 --> 22:46.000]  I mean, the New York Times just had a bunch of headlines this year saying it's time to stop telling the truth.
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.000]  It's time to stop asking questions.
[22:50.000 --> 22:55.000]  It's good to be lied to. These are headlines.
[22:55.000 --> 23:01.000]  Oh, don't ask too many questions. Don't do your own research. These are quotes.
[23:01.000 --> 23:06.000]  And the only way they can gas like you and tell you all this and tell you things that are
[23:06.000 --> 23:12.000]  demonstratively authoritarian and dangerous and not true is if there's no opposition anywhere.
[23:12.000 --> 23:15.000]  That's why they're getting rid of the comments all over the Internet.
[23:15.000 --> 23:20.000]  That's why they're getting rid of any ways for you to communicate because they are bringing in a prison,
[23:20.000 --> 23:29.000]  lockdown, society, and info wars is just a canary in that coal mine.
[23:29.000 --> 23:38.000]  They are accelerating the demise of the currency all over the world to bring in the new global digital programmable token
[23:38.000 --> 23:47.000]  that the central banks will control worldwide and that they will connect to your social credit score
[23:47.000 --> 23:50.000]  to monitor and track your behavior.
[23:50.000 --> 23:55.000]  And a lot of people are going to be, well, I'll just comply, but they're always going to add more compliance
[23:55.000 --> 24:04.000]  to what you've got to do until you're as bad off as they are in communist China with years of lockdown,
[24:04.000 --> 24:09.000]  starvation, mass suicide, and death for asymptomatic people not even dying of COVID.
[24:09.000 --> 24:14.000]  It's all a raw exercise of power.
[24:14.000 --> 24:21.000]  And I am just here fighting as hard as I can with everything I've got.
[24:21.000 --> 24:28.000]  Try to stay on air as long as possible until humanity finds its soul again and stands up peacefully
[24:28.000 --> 24:32.000]  and says, no, and that's starting to happen.
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  So they had two years of police state.
[24:34.000 --> 24:39.000]  They backed off a little because all the prominent people were waking up and speaking out.
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  And the attempts to silence people weren't working.
[24:41.000 --> 24:44.000]  So they backed off some.
[24:44.000 --> 24:49.000]  But now they're setting up and preparing the next wave of fear and the next wave of control
[24:49.000 --> 24:57.000]  and the next group of lockdowns and the next group of censoring and systems to silence their opposition.
[24:57.000 --> 25:03.000]  You can't avoid this corruption and just hide under a rock and hope it goes away.
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  It's not going to go away.
[25:05.000 --> 25:10.000]  And I am very honored and blessed that we've been on the air 28 years and have learned a lot together
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.000]  and have made mistakes, but overall have changed the world for the better
[25:14.000 --> 25:19.000]  and have really gotten more accurate and more truthful and more insightful as time goes on.
[25:19.000 --> 25:25.000]  And that is all the good brain and soul God gave me and the great brain and soul God gave you
[25:25.000 --> 25:30.000]  and all the listeners and all the guests in this family that is in force.
[25:30.000 --> 25:36.000]  But I got to tell you, folks, you're the only thing in our corner and I'm in your corner.
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.000]  It's not the courts, it's not the corrupt bureaucracies, it's not the systems and it's three things
[25:41.000 --> 25:44.000]  that override the enemy and you know what they are, it's prayer.
[25:44.000 --> 25:50.000]  It's word of mouth to make sure this broadcast gets through the censors, it gets to the right people and it's money.
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  And I'm firing the bat signal here.
[25:52.000 --> 25:57.000]  We've been firing it for a while, but now I'm like, folks at the Alamo, send that letter out.
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  I'm not going to give up, I'm not going to back down.
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.000]  I'm sending the letter out saying please send reinforcements, but we're going to stay here.
[26:03.000 --> 26:07.000]  And I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, whatever has to happen is going to happen,
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  but I want to be strong and I want to continue to persevere.
[26:10.000 --> 26:17.000]  And the biggest way you can do that right now is by going to infoworkstore.com
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  and getting things you already need.
[26:19.000 --> 26:24.000]  I mean, look, I shouldn't be selling all this stuff on sale because here's the predicament we're in.
[26:24.000 --> 26:30.000]  I'm spending almost all the money that comes in on infrastructure and the crew
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  and legal and bandwidth and all of it.
[26:33.000 --> 26:39.000]  And then we have to buy product going forward and prices have gone up and supply chains have broken down.
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.000]  So it's six weeks, it's 25, 30 weeks for a product.
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.000]  We've got that money where now people should let you do it for no money down and pay when it was ready
[26:46.000 --> 26:50.000]  or half the money down and then pay when you got the rest.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  We don't get that with anybody anymore.
[26:52.000 --> 26:58.000]  And so I'm sitting here looking at the product we've got, the books, the films, the t-shirts,
[26:58.000 --> 27:06.000]  everything we've got in stock and thinking, I can run off this stock for six, seven months, no problem.
[27:06.000 --> 27:15.000]  But then I'll have to basically implode and let go of most of the crew and do the show on a shoestring.
[27:15.000 --> 27:16.000]  It'll still be to everywhere.
[27:16.000 --> 27:17.000]  It'll still be available.
[27:17.000 --> 27:21.000]  It'll still be huge, but not as effective.
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  I don't want that to happen.
[27:23.000 --> 27:24.000]  So it's really simple.
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.000]  All of you that have been on the fence, all of you that have listened to the show over the years
[27:28.000 --> 27:34.000]  and never gone to infowarstore.com, folks that have been doing that are the reason that the broadcast is still here
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.000]  and we've influenced so many powerful people and so many important people and so many influential people
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  and so many great common people.
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  It's just immeasurable what this family of Info Wars has done.
[27:45.000 --> 27:46.000]  And so we've already had a mighty effect.
[27:46.000 --> 27:47.000]  That's why they hate us so much.
[27:47.000 --> 27:50.000]  But I believe our most important work is still to come.
[27:50.000 --> 27:57.000]  But I can't win this fight without your commission and your commission is praying for us, spreading the word,
[27:57.000 --> 28:02.000]  sharing the articles and videos and information, and going to infowarstore.com.
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  So I need to see.
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  I'm making some decisions right now.
[28:06.000 --> 28:13.000]  I need to see from you a sign that you want to support us.
[28:13.000 --> 28:21.000]  I need to see that you really want me to take it to the next level or if you're not in the fight
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.000]  and you don't think it's important to keep us on air, I totally understand.
[28:24.000 --> 28:29.000]  It's a free will universe and I'm not even mad at you and that's God's will because I'm pretty tired.
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  But I'm not going to give up.
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  I could just give out as they say.
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  So go to infowarstore.com right now.
[28:35.000 --> 28:38.000]  Don't wait and get the new Alex Jones with right shirt.
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.000]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  It's sold a little bit of a premium.
[28:41.000 --> 28:44.000]  All the other shirts being sold at cost, total clearance.
[28:44.000 --> 28:45.000]  Alex Jones was right.
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  Get yours for men and women today.
[28:47.000 --> 28:50.000]  It's historic on the back infowarstore.com.
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  And again, this could be the last time the last few months you could get any of this stuff because I can tell you folks,
[28:54.000 --> 28:55.000]  I'm not playing around.
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.000]  We are barely operating.
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.000]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand infowarstore.
[29:03.000 --> 29:08.000]  So I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show.
[29:08.000 --> 29:11.000]  And I wanted to hire camera people. I wanted to make films.
[29:11.000 --> 29:13.000]  I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[29:13.000 --> 29:15.000]  And it was a t-shirt I designed the first one.
[29:15.000 --> 29:22.000]  Mass murderers agree gun control works that helped us finance hiring the first three members of my crew.
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  That's our oldest design and we still sell it.
[29:24.000 --> 29:30.000]  We have that design over a hundred others that will now all be limited editions because whatever stock we've got in,
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.000]  that's it.
[29:31.000 --> 29:35.000]  We're selling everything out to find the operation to get rid of inventory.
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  We'll still have some teachers in the future.
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  They'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.000]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance.
[29:43.000 --> 29:44.000]  I almost forgot.
[29:44.000 --> 29:48.000]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[29:48.000 --> 29:55.000]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts, designer shirts,
[29:55.000 --> 29:59.000]  they're all selling at cost infowarstore.com.
[29:59.000 --> 30:03.000]  You know, it's a fact, and I'm out bragging when I say it, it's just true,
[30:03.000 --> 30:08.000]  that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty,
[30:08.000 --> 30:16.000]  as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[30:16.000 --> 30:23.000]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done.
[30:23.000 --> 30:30.000]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them, at infowarstore.com.
[30:30.000 --> 30:33.000]  And we are funded by listeners and viewers like you.
[30:33.000 --> 30:38.000]  And so now we need to support more than ever, because this fight has intensified,
[30:38.000 --> 30:41.000]  don't need me to tell you that, at infowarstore.com.
[30:41.000 --> 30:45.000]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now.
[30:45.000 --> 30:48.000]  Things have been sold out for a long time, like info wars life,
[30:48.000 --> 30:54.000]  fizzy magnesium mix that's so amazing, and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[30:54.000 --> 30:59.000]  They're all available 25 to 75% off at infowarstore.com right now.
[30:59.000 --> 31:08.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history.
[31:08.000 --> 31:14.000]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains have broken down,
[31:14.000 --> 31:20.000]  and info wars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for operations.
[31:20.000 --> 31:25.000]  And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalist making their main move.
[31:25.000 --> 31:31.000]  Info wars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever, it's reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
[31:31.000 --> 31:36.000]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else,
[31:36.000 --> 31:39.000]  we are running out of money.
[31:39.000 --> 31:48.000]  So listen up to 75% off at infowarstore.com on things like amazing patriot t-shirts that help spread the word and fund the operation.
[31:48.000 --> 31:57.000]  On supplements, on books, on films, everything is 25 to 75% off right now. The biggest sell in our history at infowarstore.com.
[31:57.000 --> 32:19.000]  Thank you for your support.
[32:28.000 --> 32:35.000]  And everyone out there that wants to be healthy and wants to boost your natural defenses should get it today.

[32:50.000 --> 32:54.000]  It's also a great gift for friends and family to boost their immune system as well.
[32:54.000 --> 32:58.000]  Get yours today at infowarstore.com for 25% off.
[33:25.000 --> 33:32.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[33:32.000 --> 33:36.000]  And we are back on this live Monday edition.
[33:36.000 --> 33:44.000]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is going to be joining us coming up in the third hour today.
[33:44.000 --> 33:50.000]  And then host Gerald Salente is going to be live during the fourth hour.
[33:50.000 --> 33:59.000]  We now know it's mainstream news, federal filings, that the DOJ was working with the CIA to spy on candidate,
[33:59.000 --> 34:03.000]  and then President-elect, and then President Trump as we told you five years ago,
[34:03.000 --> 34:10.000]  and that they were planting and creating false information.
[34:10.000 --> 34:26.000]  And we just saw a federal jury in Michigan find not guilty and then mistrial the others for the kidnapping plot for Governor Whitmer.
[34:26.000 --> 34:30.000]  They had another big federal trial a few years ago with the Hatari militia they had set up,
[34:30.000 --> 34:35.000]  and provocateur they all were found not guilty.
[34:35.000 --> 34:41.000]  So the good news is the American people are waking up and seeing through this more and more.
[34:41.000 --> 34:50.000]  And when you've got all these Washington Post and New York Times and Financial Times of London articles about dictatorships good,
[34:50.000 --> 34:59.000]  we need to get rid of the people actually running things.
[34:59.000 --> 35:07.000]  Isn't that just amazing? And then, oh, Alex Jones thinks there's a one world government that wants to cut off your resources
[35:07.000 --> 35:14.000]  and forcibly inoculate you and is going to use AI computers and cameras to track and trace everything you do.
[35:14.000 --> 35:23.000]  They still write articles every day saying, I'm evil and none of us exist.
[35:23.000 --> 35:30.000]  If you say it, we're going to sue you and rig the courts and destroy you and silence you.
[35:30.000 --> 35:38.000]  So that when people see world government being announced and, oh, it's going to be post-human and, oh, we're going to take over your body,
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  people go, well, I better not criticize it.
[35:41.000 --> 35:43.000]  I mean, I'll end up like Alex Jones.
[35:43.000 --> 35:49.000]  Hell, you'll end up like people starving to death all over the world.
[35:49.000 --> 35:56.000]  And I look at these globalist sacks of garbage, how they sit up there and just throw this in everybody's face and they think it's so funny
[35:56.000 --> 36:07.000]  and it's so cute and they worship Madeleine Albright.
[36:07.000 --> 36:12.000]  Hey, was it good that you tripled the sanctions of Herbert Walker Bush under Clinton
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  and that directly killed 500,000 children at least? Is that a good price to pay?
[36:16.000 --> 36:19.000]  She goes, yeah, it's a good price to pay, do it again.
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  It's like, oh, you're a woman.
[36:21.000 --> 36:25.000]  Oh, my God, you're so wonderful.
[36:25.000 --> 36:30.000]  We have to bow down to you because you look like a goblin.
[36:30.000 --> 36:36.000]  Oh, and she bombs Serbia and blows up half their major cities with depleted uranium bombs.
[36:36.000 --> 36:41.000]  It's like, oh, it's liberal.
[36:41.000 --> 36:49.000]  And the Serbs even said at the time to her, they said, why are you doing this when you escape with your father from Nazi Germany?
[36:49.000 --> 36:53.000]  During World War II, we hid you and protected you.
[36:53.000 --> 36:57.000]  And she responded by bombing them later.
[36:57.000 --> 37:02.000]  Of course, it was on 60 minutes, people saw the paintings.
[37:02.000 --> 37:08.000]  Her house is full of stolen paintings from Jews rounded up and killed by the Nazis.
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.000]  Famous ones, because that's what her father did like George Soros when he was older,
[37:13.000 --> 37:24.000]  was he was a Jew that rounded up Jews and robbed them and told them he was going to get them out of the country and then dead.
[37:24.000 --> 37:33.000]  These are some really, really, really, really evil people, folks.
[37:33.000 --> 37:37.000]  Want to know who you're up against?
[37:37.000 --> 37:42.000]  People just like her, now burning in hell.
[37:42.000 --> 37:48.000]  So I'm going to give the number out and I'm going to take your calls today on the war, on the new cupboard lockdowns.
[37:48.000 --> 37:54.000]  They're definitely trying to bring back on what's happening in the economy, how you're dealing with inflation.
[37:54.000 --> 37:59.000]  I really don't want to sit here and, you know, bore you with poor Alex Jones, what's happening to me.
[37:59.000 --> 38:07.000]  But I mean, I can tell you, folks, I've gone out and talked to separate third party, big, famous law firms,
[38:07.000 --> 38:12.000]  and they don't believe the rulings and the things being done in Connecticut and Texas.
[38:12.000 --> 38:18.000]  And the proposal for the trial coming up in a week and a half,
[38:18.000 --> 38:26.000]  two weeks, jury selections next week in Texas for one of three lawsuits they've got against me here.
[38:26.000 --> 38:38.000]  The first Sandy Hook one says, we are not allowed to raise the first amendment or any defenses or talk, basically.
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.000]  The jury's told I'm guilty. We can't respond.
[38:41.000 --> 38:45.000]  And then they sit there and tell them he's got $200 million and he made all his money off Sandy Hook.
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  I've been the depositions, four of them.
[38:47.000 --> 38:50.000]  By the way, this week they wanted me for another deposition.
[38:50.000 --> 38:57.000]  And so I said, okay, so they had a third party group that wanted to depose me,
[38:57.000 --> 39:01.000]  who was a party because of insurance companies and GCN and things.
[39:01.000 --> 39:11.000]  So it's the Connecticut anti-gun Bloomberg, Blumenthal lawyers, Blumenthal's son, basically, in there they run it.
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.000]  And I come in the morning at 9 a.m. for the deposition and they go,
[39:15.000 --> 39:22.000]  and then one of the other lawyers says, oh, I had something come up and they're like, oh, fine, we'll just reschedule in two weeks.
[39:22.000 --> 39:28.000]  But I tried to reschedule when I had Vertigo.
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  Dr. Marble thought it might be a heart problem.
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  It got checked out. It was an infection.
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  I go, hey, let me just reschedule next week.
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  Oh, my God, we'll arrest you.
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  You all saw this money.
[39:38.000 --> 39:44.000]  $25,000 first day, $50,000 the next day, $100,000 the next day, up to one point, whatever million I'm just like.
[39:44.000 --> 39:49.000]  They treat me like I'm Daddy Warbucks, like I'm Howard Hughes.
[39:49.000 --> 39:54.000]  They treat me like I just bathe in gold like Scrooge McDuck.
[39:54.000 --> 39:57.000]  They treat me like I'm Lex Luthor and a child molester mixed together.
[39:57.000 --> 40:00.000]  And it's all just completely insane.
[40:00.000 --> 40:05.000]  And that's the model for everybody else.
[40:05.000 --> 40:10.000]  And it's scary to see it happening and to watch it going on.
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.000]  So I'm trying to just get into federal court, probably won't even be able to,
[40:14.000 --> 40:18.000]  just to swear under federal court and they'll send a trustee to look at everything
[40:18.000 --> 40:23.000]  and know we're not lying about not having, because I mean, again,
[40:23.000 --> 40:27.000]  they have HBO, they have Netflix, all of them coming to try to film this trial next week.
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  The judge is combing her hair and prepping.
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  They admit it's all about media and all about being famous and all about making money off me.
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.000]  While claiming I made money off them, which isn't even true,
[40:38.000 --> 40:43.000]  and then, you know, I'm going to get subpoenaed in order to sit there like a monkey,
[40:43.000 --> 40:47.000]  but then I'm not allowed to talk.
[40:47.000 --> 40:50.000]  I've got a whole list of things that I can't talk about.
[40:50.000 --> 40:55.000]  The First Amendment or how I didn't damage these people or any of this stuff.
[40:55.000 --> 40:58.000]  I mean, you read this, it's like a Monty Python joke.
[40:58.000 --> 41:01.000]  It makes the trial and anyocracy look fair.
[41:01.000 --> 41:04.000]  And again, this is your freedoms.
[41:04.000 --> 41:07.000]  They're not going to just stop a censoring you off the web.
[41:07.000 --> 41:09.000]  They're not going to just stop taking your bank accounts.
[41:09.000 --> 41:13.000]  They're going to take all your freedoms, folks, and throw you in a gulag,
[41:13.000 --> 41:19.000]  and we're not approaching that. We're here.
[41:19.000 --> 41:25.000]  Hundreds of peaceful people that didn't even touch a cop on January 6th are still in prison,
[41:25.000 --> 41:31.000]  still in jail, in solitary confinement, and there aren't even getting trials.
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  The law about speedy trials is just being totally ignored,
[41:35.000 --> 41:42.000]  because the IQs are dropping, the society's falling apart, things are breaking down.
[41:42.000 --> 41:49.000]  And you know it's just going to get more intense and more insane from this point out.
[41:49.000 --> 41:54.000]  And we're under judgment, and I'm not perfect either, but my God, I'm trying to get close to the God.
[41:54.000 --> 41:59.000]  I mean, I'm trying to just say, hey, I want to have a civilization,
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  I want to save place for my children, and I don't want a bunch of wars,
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.000]  and I don't want a bunch of death, and I don't want all this pedophilia,
[42:05.000 --> 42:12.000]  and I want due process, and the system is you're going to get evil, and that's the end of it.
[42:12.000 --> 42:16.000]  We're going to brainwash children, we're going to sterilize them, we're going to open the borders,
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.000]  we're going to child traffic, we're going to devalue your currency,
[42:19.000 --> 42:25.000]  Hollywood's going to wage war on you, and I just sit back and I watch us going into oblivion.
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  But the good news is more and more resistance is mounting,
[42:28.000 --> 42:31.000]  and I've got some good news to talk about when we come back to the next segment,
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  and I'm going to give the toll free number out right now,
[42:33.000 --> 42:49.000]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539, infowars.com, Tomar's Doos, today,
[42:49.000 --> 42:56.000]  and all the apparel, ball caps, t-shirts, hoodies, long sleeve, they're all being sold at cost,
[42:56.000 --> 43:00.000]  except for the Alex Jones's right shirt.
[43:00.000 --> 43:04.000]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand infowars.
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.000]  I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show.
[43:09.000 --> 43:13.000]  I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films, I wanted to really challenge the globalists.
[43:13.000 --> 43:18.000]  And it was a t-shirt I designed, the first one, Mass Murderers Agreed Gun Control Works,
[43:18.000 --> 43:22.000]  that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew.
[43:22.000 --> 43:24.000]  That's our oldest design and we still sell it.
[43:24.000 --> 43:29.000]  We have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited editions
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.000]  because whatever stock we've got in, that's it.
[43:31.000 --> 43:36.000]  We're selling everything out to fund the operation to get rid of inventory.
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  We'll still have some t-shirts in the future.
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  They'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[43:40.000 --> 43:44.000]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance.
[43:44.000 --> 43:48.000]  I almost forgot, we're selling them all at cost at infowars.com.
[43:48.000 --> 43:55.000]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts, designer shirts,

[45:30.000 --> 45:34.000]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients

[45:59.000 --> 46:03.000]  You know, it's a fact, and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true,
[46:03.000 --> 46:08.000]  that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty,
[46:08.000 --> 46:16.000]  as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[46:16.000 --> 46:23.000]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done.
[46:23.000 --> 46:29.000]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them,
[46:29.000 --> 46:33.000]  at infowarsstore.com, and we are funded by listeners and viewers like you,
[46:33.000 --> 46:38.000]  and so now we need to support more than ever because this fight has intensified.
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  Don't need me to tell you that.
[46:40.000 --> 46:45.000]  At infowarsstore.com, we've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now.
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.000]  Things have been sold out for a long time, like infowarslife,
[46:48.000 --> 46:54.000]  fizzy magnesium mix that's so amazing, and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[46:54.000 --> 47:23.000]  They're all available 25 to 75% off at infowarsstore.com right now.
[47:23.000 --> 47:29.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[47:53.000 --> 48:04.000]  The globalists have shed in their white papers, in their own UN documents,
[48:04.000 --> 48:10.000]  that they want to create race-specific bio-weapons and other systems to depopulate the planet.
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.000]  A lot of this from my sources is that they're preparing to release bio-weapons,
[48:14.000 --> 48:19.000]  claim that they're naturally occurring, and then use that as the cover
[48:19.000 --> 48:24.000]  for civil emergencies, societal control, crackdowns on free speech.
[48:24.000 --> 48:27.000]  Obama put the internet kill switch in five years ago,
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  and when he got confronted by Congress, he said,
[48:29.000 --> 48:34.000]  well, it's in case the birds loo or stars gets out, and they have to control, panic,
[48:34.000 --> 48:38.000]  and direct every website in the U.S. to one government announcement.
[48:38.000 --> 48:43.000]  And we looked at every angle and believed a bio-weapon release could be the thing they'd release
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.000]  to bring in a world government to counter a global problem,
[48:46.000 --> 48:51.000]  and the UN has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government.
[48:51.000 --> 48:56.000]  Mike Adams and I were on air saying if they have these lockdowns for more than just a few months
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.000]  and around the world, it's still ongoing in some areas.
[48:59.000 --> 49:03.000]  Because the IMF and World Bank controls these third-world countries in Asia,
[49:03.000 --> 49:06.000]  Latin America, the Middle East, and in Africa,
[49:06.000 --> 49:11.000]  and they say if you want the money, you've got to lock people down and say they're not essential.
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  Say again?
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  Is it possible to prevent the next pandemic?
[49:15.000 --> 49:21.000]  Yes, if every country does what Australia did, then you wouldn't be calling it a pandemic.
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  That's all.
[49:23.000 --> 49:27.000]  So it's a short-term thing that these leaders get to enslave their own people,
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  and it puts the UN in charge and in control.
[49:29.000 --> 49:35.000]  Now the UN is trying to get a treaty passed where they have control of all pandemic responses now.
[49:35.000 --> 49:39.000]  So we're going into world government, we're going into the new world order right now.
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  And so this is just mathematics.
[49:41.000 --> 49:47.000]  If you cut off the fertilizer, if you cut off the oil and the natural gas,
[49:47.000 --> 49:51.000]  if you lock people down around the world, it's going to cause a collapse.
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.000]  And so there's no doubt we're in a collapse.
[49:54.000 --> 49:57.000]  There's no doubt we're in inflation and hyperinflation.
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.000]  The question is how bad will it get in different sectors of the world
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  and what's coming here and how do we get ready?
[50:03.000 --> 50:08.000]  And these supply chain breakdowns are also going to permanently destroy
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  literally hundreds of thousands of small businesses across America.
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.000]  I interviewed a business owner just the other day asking about these questions.
[50:14.000 --> 50:19.000]  He is able to adapt and barely able to get supplies and keep his business operating.
[50:19.000 --> 50:25.000]  But a lot of businesses, once they hit one month where they can't get supplies, just one month,
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  many of these businesses will have to liquidate.
[50:27.000 --> 50:30.000]  So they will sell off the equipment, they will lose the employees,
[50:30.000 --> 50:33.000]  and they lose the knowledge base of how to make things.
[50:33.000 --> 50:37.000]  It's important for people to understand that what has already been set into motion,
[50:37.000 --> 50:41.000]  including the economic sanctions against Russia by Western nations,
[50:41.000 --> 50:47.000]  this will spell really inflation doom for the next one to two years,
[50:47.000 --> 50:51.000]  affecting food supply, energy supply, and of course many other things.
[50:51.000 --> 50:55.000]  And then, I know you want to bring this in, but the Shanghai lockdowns in China,
[50:55.000 --> 50:59.000]  which I believe are contrived in order to punish the West,
[50:59.000 --> 51:02.000]  that's also going to worsen the supply chain disruptions
[51:02.000 --> 51:06.000]  and make it almost impossible for American companies to get supplies
[51:06.000 --> 51:10.000]  and build homes to acquire resins or electronic parts.
[51:10.000 --> 51:15.000]  I mean, Taiwan companies that operate in China have had to shut down their factories.
[51:15.000 --> 51:19.000]  So they can't even ship out of Taiwan now because they can't get their stuff out of China.
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  China is trying to punish the West.
[51:21.000 --> 51:25.000]  They're trying to break the economies of the United States and Western Europe,
[51:25.000 --> 51:29.000]  and they're willing to lockdown and really murder their own people in order to achieve that.
[51:29.000 --> 51:33.000]  Remember that the Shanghai lockdowns are not only affecting the port operations,
[51:33.000 --> 51:39.000]  they're affecting domestic trucking, which means that the supply chain to the factories in Shanghai
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  is also now completely broken.
[51:41.000 --> 51:47.000]  You can't even get a supply truck from somewhere else in China to come into Shanghai to supply a factory there.
[51:47.000 --> 51:52.000]  So this also means that you can't get containers for international shipping,
[51:52.000 --> 51:56.000]  even in other countries such as Taiwan and Japan and South Korea,
[51:56.000 --> 52:00.000]  which have their own exports, but they're having a very difficult time getting containers
[52:00.000 --> 52:03.000]  because they're all log jammed in Shanghai.
[52:03.000 --> 52:06.000]  You've got Biden with 20-something approval ratings,
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  94% of folks blame him for inflation.
[52:08.000 --> 52:14.000]  So it looks like the Lib Tards are finally starting to get it, but is it too little, too late?
[52:14.000 --> 52:17.000]  Well, I think it is because the other thing that's going to be set off by this
[52:17.000 --> 52:22.000]  is a massive wave of starving migrants from South America,
[52:22.000 --> 52:27.000]  and they're going to be coming across the border because of what Biden is doing to open up the border.
[52:27.000 --> 52:31.000]  And as the food inflation and fuel inflation worsens,
[52:31.000 --> 52:35.000]  these people are going to suffer collapse in their own nations in Central and South America,
[52:35.000 --> 52:38.000]  and they're going to be streaming into North America.
[52:38.000 --> 52:44.000]  So if people thought the situation was bad right now in terms of illegal immigration and a migrant invasion,
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  it's going to get far, far worse.
[52:46.000 --> 52:52.000]  So we're really looking at a global collapse of the ability of people to buy food and fuel.
[52:52.000 --> 52:59.000]  Now, if the public isn't smart enough to get that, they better wake up fast or they're dead.
[52:59.000 --> 53:04.000]  All right, folks, next hour we're going to take nothing but your calls ahead of Judge Andrew DePaulitano
[53:04.000 --> 53:13.000]  joining us to talk about the confirmed permanent state coup that has taken control of our civilization.
[53:13.000 --> 53:23.000]  In fact, I have a very important Jimmy Door piece he did where he analyzes a MSNBC host
[53:23.000 --> 53:27.000]  of all people admitting what really happened and what really unfolded.
[53:27.000 --> 53:32.000]  So I'm going to play that, and I'm going to get to some positive news with Governor DeSantis
[53:32.000 --> 53:35.000]  when we start the next hour.
[53:35.000 --> 53:41.000]  But I'm just going to be 100% frank on a straight shooter with listeners.
[53:41.000 --> 53:49.000]  I never set up info wars as the sole mission of making myself a bunch of money.
[53:49.000 --> 53:54.000]  I set it up to fund an independent media organization that's made documentary films
[53:54.000 --> 54:01.000]  and special reports, news reports that have reached billions and billions and billions of people
[54:01.000 --> 54:06.000]  thanks to you supporting us as sharing the information.
[54:06.000 --> 54:12.000]  And we wouldn't even be in a fighting stance right now with the globalists worldwide
[54:12.000 --> 54:18.000]  if we hadn't done this, whether it is Hungary or whether it's the UK or whether it's Brazil
[54:18.000 --> 54:24.000]  or whether it's the US, or when you go to anti-lockdown rallies in Australia or in Canada,
[54:24.000 --> 54:30.000]  a large portion of the resistance is our listeners and people we helped wake up.
[54:30.000 --> 54:35.000]  So we are the most hardcore, most accurate, most focused group out there.
[54:35.000 --> 54:43.000]  And yeah, behind the scenes also had a great effect, you know, influenced a lot of people that's from the grace of God.
[54:43.000 --> 54:50.000]  And I know whatever happens to me in info wars, we've already given the globalists a big run for their money.
[54:50.000 --> 54:56.000]  But I know our most important work is at hand, and so it's very simple.
[54:56.000 --> 55:03.000]  I need all the crew we have here, and I need the crew that runs the shopping cart
[55:03.000 --> 55:07.000]  and the infrastructure and the affiliate relations for hundreds of radio and TV stations.
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  That's one person's job.
[55:09.000 --> 55:15.000]  And I need the producers, the book guests, and I need them to set me up for interviews
[55:15.000 --> 55:19.000]  and I need this organization the way it is.
[55:19.000 --> 55:25.000]  I can go do it out of a small facility with four employees, have the uplink and have a video cam
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  and have my show and do a pretty good job.
[55:27.000 --> 55:33.000]  But all the other stuff and the Band-Aught video reaching four or five million people a day
[55:33.000 --> 55:37.000]  and growing and a platform for so many others, that won't be there.
[55:37.000 --> 55:41.000]  And by the way, that's a look out for success thing.
[55:41.000 --> 55:46.000]  Band-Aught video gets so many viewers and so much traffic now more than info wars
[55:46.000 --> 55:50.000]  that it's extremely expensive, $200 plus thousand a month.
[55:50.000 --> 55:55.000]  Now we've got some of the cheapest band without there, but it is quality video we serve up.
[55:55.000 --> 56:01.000]  And that just enrages the new world order to have videos every day with a million views, one video.
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.000]  Most of the video, average video, it's about 100,000 views.
[56:04.000 --> 56:07.000]  And there's hundreds of contributors on Band-Aught videos.
[56:07.000 --> 56:10.000]  So don't let them silence us.
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  And I see a lot of traffic on the store I'm told by the crew, a lot of visitors, a lot of people buying stuff.
[56:14.000 --> 56:18.000]  Great because I need a lot of money to prosecute this war.
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  Go to infowarksstore.com.
[56:20.000 --> 56:24.000]  All of the t-shirts are being sold at cost, all the apparel.
[56:24.000 --> 56:27.000]  Hundreds of designs that I made over the years that we're never bringing back.
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  We're clearing them all out.
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  We have five or six new shirts coming in.
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  Those will be at cost.
[56:33.000 --> 56:42.000]  But one shirt that will be sold at a premium for $24.95 for the regular shirt that really is designer quality.
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  We got even more fancy one coming in soon.
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  It's going to cost more.
[56:46.000 --> 56:53.000]  It's $24.95 and that way we make $18 or so to fund our operation.
[56:53.000 --> 56:57.000]  Alex Jones was right with a big red thunderbolt in the front, the back, infowars.com.
[56:57.000 --> 57:01.000]  This is such an important shirt and it funds our operations.
[57:01.000 --> 57:07.000]  Everybody to get their historical shirt now at infowarksstore.com or AAA-253-3139.

[57:15.000 --> 57:16.000]  It's an amazing new tropic.
[57:16.000 --> 57:17.000]  Really gets your mind focused.
[57:17.000 --> 57:18.000]  It's very special.
[57:18.000 --> 57:23.000]  Like anything I've ever used, it's very powerful cold-pressed herbs and special compounds.
[57:23.000 --> 57:29.000]  It's back in stock 40% off and that big 75% off sale, 75% off, that's got to end today as well.
[57:29.000 --> 57:34.000]  I got to go over there and look at what we got left and what we have here and what I'm going to try to purchase in the future.
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  I'm not whining.

[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  so we can fight hard and not let these global assailants.
[57:44.000 --> 57:49.000]  If you support us, we're going nowhere.
[58:15.000 --> 58:19.000]  We're selling them for $15, selling them for $20, whatever the shirt costs.
[58:19.000 --> 58:23.000]  If the shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5 for us to actually produce.
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  If it costs $10, we're selling it for $10.
[58:25.000 --> 58:29.000]  And we've got hoodies and we've got long sleeves and we've got short sleeves.
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  We've got them all and we've got to liquidate them all.
[58:31.000 --> 58:36.000]  And they're limited edition because we're never going to make any of these designs.
[58:36.000 --> 58:41.000]  Again, we are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited and limited edition in the future.
[58:41.000 --> 58:46.000]  We've got to sell this to keep M4s on the air, plus it spreads the word infowarsstore.com.
[58:46.000 --> 58:49.000]  Here, historic apparel now, infowarsstore.com.

[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  I have some really good news.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  I'm going to be getting to as well on the DeSantis front and a lot more.
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  But let me go ahead and just do this now.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  I'm going to tape this live on air to have an ad that we can run during all the shows
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  to hopefully be able to operate in the future.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  And that way I won't plug later in the hour, we can just get to a lot of your calls and cover all this news.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  So get the live show feed article ready for me guys, thanks.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  Okay.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have had quite a run here at info wars.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  We've had a huge, huge effect when it comes to the fight against the globalist.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  And we've changed the world together.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  And I want to thank you for all you've done over the years with your prayers or word of mouth
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  and shopping with us and supporting us while at the same time getting great products
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  and infowarsstore.com.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  But now because of supply chain breakdowns and now because of all the Democratic Party funded lawsuits
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  and the slanted nature of those attacks, we are maxed out and pushed up against a wall.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  It's like America's pushed up against a wall.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  And we're being bullied.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  We're being brutalized by the special interests that want to get through us to be able to get to you.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  So if we put today's live show headline up on screen for TV viewers and ask the question,
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  did Alex Jones Info Wars, declared bankruptcy, tune in and learn the truth?
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  If you scroll down in that live show feed today, you'll find a subsection that's on infowarstore.com
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  where when you click on it, it takes you to a subpage at infowarsstore.com
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  where you can make a $5, $10, $20, $50, $100 one time donation
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  or you can sign up for a recurring donation cancel anytime.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  But this is the time and the fight for freedom to understand.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  They're going to take everything from you if you don't start spending time and energy in the fight.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  And I'm not talking to regular listeners that have supported us over the years.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  That's a great job.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  I'm talking to new listeners or occasional listeners who need to understand
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  this is a serious situation we're in and you need to put skin in the game financially
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  to keep operations on the air like info wars.
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  Think of the millions of people that learned about ivermectin and zinc and vitamin D
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  and hydroxychloroquine alone from the show.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  Think about the pedophile drag queen story times that have been exposed and stopped by this broadcast.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  Think about our border reports exposing the human smuggling that trigger congressional investigations.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  Think about our anti-war reporting.
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  Think about our 9-11 and Bohemian Grove and our reporting on the globalist and the occult.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  I mean to try to list our exposure of fluoride in the water and atrazine
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  and the attack on our children with the whole transgender cult.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  Think about everything we've been through together and just imagine info wars not being there.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  So when I ask you to go to infowarstore.com and every day during the live show under the live show fee
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  we'll have a link to it as well where you can donate and we can buy products and again
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  all the t-shirts all the apparel all the ball caps all the flags some of it going back
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  some of the stuff's been the warehouse five years over a hundred designs great shirts great ball caps
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  you name it we're selling it all at cost and the future we're just going to have a limited edition shirts
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  for a limited time only a few designs at a time because we can't sit there and pay for the larger inventory
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  we just can't do it so one of a kind shirts get them infowarstore.com and the new Alex Jones was right shirt
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  very good looking shirt big red thunderbolt Alex Jones was right on the back infowars.com
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  this is a limited edition shirt we're only selling this limited edition for one month and it's $24.95
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  so we get $18 from the sales it's really nice fabric it's an expensive shirt for us to make to fund our operations
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  so get your Alex Jones was right historic shirt and know you took part in the battle of the republic
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  in the battle for free human will and free speech worldwide at infowarstore.com
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  or by calling toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine I want to thank you all for your support
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  the only way we we fail is if you don't take action when we get together and stand up against the globalists
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  we are unstoppable I'm counting on you stay with us
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  it's about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand in for worse I've been on the air a couple of years
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show and I wanted to hire camera people
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  I wanted to make films I wanted to really challenge the globalists
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  and it was a t-shirt I designed the first one mass murderers agree gun control works
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  that's our oldest design and we're still selling
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  we have that design over a hundred others that will now all be limited editions
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  because whatever shop we've got in that's it we're selling everything out
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  to fund the operation to get rid of inventory we'll still have some t-shirts in the future
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  they'll just be limited editions and short runs so if you want to get any of these historic shirts
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  this is your last chance I almost forgot we're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  every ball cap every flag every hoodie every long sleeve every t-shirt regular shirts designer shirts
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  they're all selling at cost infowarstore.com
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:06.000]  you founded the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  it's Monday April 18th a year it's 2022 and I'm your host Alex Jones
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  all right let's go ahead and lay it out here I want to go to your phone calls the rest of the hour
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  Judge Andrew DePolitanos joining us with some huge deep state permanent state breaking news
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  but I got some positive news I want to hit right now DeSantis Blast pro-infanticide late term abortions
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  and Florida and other states are now passing laws or have passed laws down more than 10 states
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  banning third trimester abortions that is a very very good start we'll get to that in a moment
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  Florida Nix's dozens of math textbooks over critical race theory common core standards that teach children
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  that 2 plus 2 could equal 6 that's USA Today is very upset that the brainwashing is not working
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  but I wanted to go to a quick Jimmy Door piece where he's playing a clip from a MSNBC advisor
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  and expert panelist explaining what's really going on in Ukraine and boy they almost have a heart attack
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  they turn as wide as a sheet when this guest is on the morning show with Psycho Joe and Zbigniew Brzezinski
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  the war criminals daughter when when the truth is laid out Jeffrey Sachs time in this is very different
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  first of all I'm like who's Jeffrey Sachs I watch MSNBC all the time I almost never I don't ever remember seeing this guy
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  why I'm like also there's a new guy I'm like I'm thinking that the CIA just pull a new guy out to push the war
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  who is this guy and listen to what he says and now you know why you're never going to see him on MSNBC here it comes
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  than just a war between two countries this is as convoluted as it gets and could get out of control
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  I don't think people might really conceptualize maybe even not this president how out of control this could escalate
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  it's true but I think we have to step back and not put this in partisan terms this is a US mistake that started seven years ago
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  and I remember the day on on your show
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  I'm like I'm just saying what you said this guy will never be this is a US what a treat to hear someone like this yes what a treat
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  I can already tell it's like you know given to you straight you know here it comes
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  when President Obama said Assad must go and I looked at you and Joe and I said how's he going to do that where's the policy for that
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  right and we know they sent in the CIA to overthrow Assad the CIA and Saudi Arabia together in covert operations tried to overthrow Assad
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  it was a disaster eventually it brought in both ISIS as a splinter group to the jihadists that went in it also brought in Russia
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  so we have been digging deeper and deeper and deeper what we should do now is get out and not continue to throw missiles
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  not have a confrontation with Russia seven years has been a disaster under Obama continuing under Trump
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  this is what I would call the permanent state this is the CIA this is Pentagon wanting to
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  so yeah they're like don't they don't know what to say no they're like oh shit he's all script he's tell the truth about what's happening
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  so he said this is the permanent state meaning it doesn't matter who's elected these are this is the CIA and the NSA this is the deep state
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  other people refer to it as the deep state the intelligence community he calls it the permanent state which I like that because it
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  lets you know that this is the permanent war machine and it doesn't matter who's the president or who's in power these are the people in power
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  the permanent state the war machine that's what he means and listen he goes on
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  no way to do that and so we have made a proxy war in Syria it's killed 500,000 people displaced 10 million and I'll say predictably so
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  as I predicted it's seven years ago that there was no way to do this and that it would make a complete chaos so what I would plead to
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  President Trump is get out like his instinct told him by the way that was his instinct but then all the establishment the New York Times
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  the Washington Post the Pentagon everybody said no no that's irresponsible but his instinct is right get out we've done it
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  this is unbelievable he's saying everybody New York Times Washington Post and hell he's laying it down and you see the stunned look at like
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  oh my god this guy somebody forgot to pay this guy somebody is this guy not under contract does he not know you just brought in someone off the street
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  they're going to tell you the truth what are you doing look at them all just stunned sitting there like this is not how it's supposed to go
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  it's damaged seven years and now we really risk a confrontation with Russia that is extraordinarily dangerous reckless
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  Admiral Savridas President Trump had reckless so there's a guy laying it down Jeffrey Sachs from Columbia University and that's stunning
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  that's stunning and they all and it's funny that they all just don't go wait a minute we started this war it was the CIA that went
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  it wasn't a natural uprising no you mean all the stuff that everybody we shouldn't be doing this this is actually us committing war crimes
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  and this is us breaking international laws yes we've got more on that coming up after I get to your calls but we have Democrats
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  and senators joining Republican senators calling for direct U.S. invasion and total war with Russia Biden's closest Senate allies suggest U.S. troops be sent to Ukraine
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  so that's the type of things that are unfolding ladies and gentlemen with Senator Chris Coons
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  and it's getting worse and worse and worse by the minute I'm going to go to break come back with your calls but let's play part of the
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  blast pearl and fantasize late term abortions we're on the march they're on the run that's why they're panicking and when we start saving the children again
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  God is going to start blessing us again here it is we're here today to protect life
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  we're here today to defend those who can't defend themselves
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  and in just a minute I will be signing House Bill 5 which protects the rights of unborn children starting at 15 weeks this is a time where these
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  babies have beating hearts they can move they can taste they can see they can feel pain they can suck their thumbs and they have brainwaves
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  and so this will represent the most significant protections for life that have been enacted in this state in a generation
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  and if you look what's going on in certain segments of our society particularly amongst people who are affiliated with far left of our political spectrum
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  of course that's over represented in places like Hollywood in the media and obviously in one of our major political parties but they are now taking the position
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  that babies can be aborted up to the ninth month literally you can go back for you parents and those are some of the most significant experiences of my life to hold your child
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  for the very first time what they would say is parent holding that child if you just go back a day or two then you would have been able to snuff the child out entirely
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  that is just fundamentally wrong that is infanticide and that has no place
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  and ladies and gentlemen just 40 years ago the majority of young people 18 to 36 and studies were pro-abortion now the vast majority are anti-abortion
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  we're winning the hearts and minds around the world the globalists are in trouble people are coming back to Christ people are coming back to country and family
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  we're winning the globalist only tactic is to attack the leaders who will stand up and tell the truth and you know somebody's good by their fruits
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  what they stand for are the fact they're under attack nobody's under more attack than we are all I want to do is stay in the fight but I can't do it without you

[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  you know why we are in so much trouble as a civilization and as a people
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  because we have been in the corruption for so long we have been having our rights taken for so long we become comfortable with it
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  and everybody just kind of has a lackadaisical patty cake idea about government corruption corporate corruption wars open borders attacks on our children's rights
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  and so even if people don't like what's happening they still have a lackadaisical view about it and hey that's great
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  you got a happy stress free life until the electricity goes off and until society collapses because the new world order believes they're filling a vacuum
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  they see a bunch of dumb down lackadaisical people and they openly say we need to go ahead and just exterminate these people they're useless eaters
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  because you're not challenging them because you're not on the field politically they believe that by that very act you deserve to die
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  and that's why the day most group and all of us say there's too many people we need to get rid of them look at these headlines
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  it's time to give the elites a bigger say in choosing the president Washington Post and we've got Bloomberg to save democracy we need a few good dictators
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  we showed a bunch of other similar headlines earlier that's who these people are
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  I'm going to go to Bob and Bonecrusher and Lauren and others here in just a moment but here's a clip indicative of what we faced on m4wars.com Jill Biden instructs confused Joe to wave to a crowd
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  after delivering remarks see Joe Biden's new handlers Jill Biden and the Easter Bunny and you can laugh at this but this was done
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  so that when they sell the country out and blow the currency the elites don't get to blame their puppet does here's the video
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  come to the south lawn thank you and happy happy Easter
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  and again they got to tell them to wave it's just it's just it's just this bizarre otherworldly image of this with all the wilting flowers and it's all of it as a complete sick joke
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  and they do these close shots there's not a big crowd there to make it look like everybody wants to meet Joe Biden
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  they're having an Easter egg roll event they call everybody out to I mean this is just unbelievable
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  let's go to your phone calls and again if you're a new lesson that just tuned in what we know about the war in Russia and Ukraine and the economy and China
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  and all of this you're like why are you talking about yourself well we ourselves are big news right now
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  I was sued over 50 times by the Democratic Party affiliate groups we beat them or settled almost all of them down to four
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  three Sandy Hook and one other one of the deals with a photo of a wrong person we identified as a shooter that we corrected quickly before they ever knew about it but they still sued us
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  and in those cases we've been defaulted saying we didn't give them stuff we lied whatever we didn't give them discovery totally not true
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  all my children and double default now saying in Texas without calling double default you can't call witnesses you can't speak you can't talk about the First Amendment
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  that's in the filings right here and so yes we've done limited chapter 11 with some of our companies and hell we may just do them all you know
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  because I need federal courts with federal trustees to come in and so they can see it all and know that we told the truth
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  because they're going to sick there while we can't talk and tell a jury that I've got hundreds of millions of dollars which I don't have ten million dollars
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  I don't have three million dollars in cash and that's money we need to buy product in the future we got like two point two million dollars
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  I need like four million to be safe and be able to take care of any undridges or problems and buy product out so I'm literally at the point of not even in the future
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  I'm not going to even buy our product even be here I'm already there with the litigation the supply chain breakdowns and all of it and they're saying
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  he's getting famous off us that's why we want to have a big TV show trial they do and he's got hundreds of millions of dollars and
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  look he's got a company with sixteen million dollars in it yeah that's called the holding company you do with supplements the supplement company we set up for liability
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  and yeah that's the sixteen million the last year buying the product but just they know all that but they play these games
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  Jones caught with slush funds and Jones caught with all this secret money and they know good and damn well because any accountant can look at they know it's not true
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  but it's being done to get a big judgment that we can't get a bond on for appeal to come in here and shut this place down
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  and you're like well that'll blow up in their face in fact there's some cartoons on info wars dot com we can show
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  for Easter and one of them is a couple of centurions Roman soldiers and there's Jesus up on the cross being crucified they say that'll show
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  these Christians this will silence Jesus's followers and so look God works in mysterious ways I started out on access TV twenty eight years ago
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  local radio twenty seven years ago syndicated twenty six years ago and I lost from a hundred and forty affiliates roughly I went out about thirty two affiliates
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  when I came out and said there were bombs in the buildings and nine eleven had an inside job element and I lost almost all my affiliates and went from
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  having a million dollars in the bank and being one of the fastest growing syndicated talk show host as a young man to having nothing
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  and I didn't even think about it because I was telling the truth so this doesn't affect me it's affecting you that the courts have become this out of control
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  and are able to do stuff like this so that's where we are and we need your support now more than ever because money is the big thing that can fix this
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  and stand up to this and ensure other things are able to be done in the future no matter what but maxed out like I am
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  I am kind of like God are you going to take me out of the game is that what you want to be in this twenty eight years because if that's your will
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  if the listeners don't support me then that's what God wants and then that's because God's always provided
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  and so if I'm so cursed in these courts and I'm so cursed with the lawyers and I'm so you know just absolutely to admit then that is God's plan
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  or I'm supposed to stay on air but I need a lot of money you understand I'm reaching the point already with the accounting
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  where I'm not going to be able to buy the DNA force plus and the body's ultimate turmeric formula and the X2 and the X3 and the coffee and all of it
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  because I like to have that money to run and I could make that decision and stay on air six eight months and then implode
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  or but I can't have it both ways where there's even you know okay put the money out there's not enough and not enough to operate now
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  I am in between a rock and a hard place I need money right now so it's simple in four just running water and frozen ocean
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  we're going to sink and it's going to go down or you're going to throw a lifeline in and the majority of the listeners
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  we know less than one percent of people ever by a product in four sort of cost you just three percent of people listening right now
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  we'll just go to infowarstore.com secure high-tech beautiful site and buy some brain force ultra

[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  we can absolutely win and dominate but I'm not Trump who had twenty billion dollars when he ran and now he's got like three billion
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  they almost destroyed him yeah he lost almost everything good for Trump you know fighting hard
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  I'm ten times more hardcore I don't have millions much less millions of dollars I have you that's it

[1:29:42.600 --> 1:29:45.640]  Again, we are going to come out with some new designs
[1:29:45.640 --> 1:29:48.320]  that will be limited, limited edition in the future.
[1:29:48.320 --> 1:29:50.560]  We've got to sell this to keep InfoWars on the air,
[1:29:50.560 --> 1:29:51.760]  plus it spreads the word.

[1:29:54.680 --> 1:29:55.840]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:29:57.080 --> 1:30:00.280]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand InfoWars.
[1:30:00.280 --> 1:30:01.400]  I've been on the air a couple of years,
[1:30:01.400 --> 1:30:04.360]  but I only had money to finance my own simple
[1:30:04.360 --> 1:30:05.800]  little local radio show.
[1:30:05.800 --> 1:30:07.880]  And I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films.
[1:30:07.880 --> 1:30:10.240]  I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[1:30:10.240 --> 1:30:11.680]  And it was a t-shirt I designed.
[1:30:11.680 --> 1:30:15.480]  The first one, Mass Murderers Agreed, Gun Control Works,
[1:30:15.480 --> 1:30:18.120]  that helped us finance hiring the first two members
[1:30:18.120 --> 1:30:19.040]  of my crew.
[1:30:19.040 --> 1:30:21.480]  That's our oldest design that we still sell.
[1:30:21.480 --> 1:30:23.760]  We have that design over 100 others
[1:30:23.760 --> 1:30:25.640]  that will now all be limited editions
[1:30:25.640 --> 1:30:27.360]  because whatever stock we've got in,
[1:30:27.360 --> 1:30:30.200]  that's it, we're selling everything out
[1:30:30.200 --> 1:30:32.800]  to fund the operation, to get rid of inventory.
[1:30:32.800 --> 1:30:34.360]  We'll still have some t-shirts in the future.

[1:33:01.120 --> 1:33:04.640]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:13.640 --> 1:33:17.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation,
[1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:19.920]  it's Alex Jones, coming to you live
[1:33:19.920 --> 1:33:23.280]  from the front lines of the Info War.
[1:33:23.280 --> 1:33:26.920]  So there were defining battles of World War II,
[1:33:26.920 --> 1:33:29.360]  like Stalin grabbed between the Nazis and the Russians,
[1:33:29.360 --> 1:33:34.360]  or Iwo Jima and Guadalcanal in the Pacific
[1:33:34.520 --> 1:33:36.360]  with the US against the Japanese.
[1:33:37.960 --> 1:33:40.440]  And right now is one of those defining moments.
[1:33:41.960 --> 1:33:43.920]  The globalists have pulled out all the stops
[1:33:43.920 --> 1:33:45.000]  to shut down InfoWars.
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:47.680]  They admit it's the model to shut down everybody else.
[1:33:47.680 --> 1:33:50.560]  And so the big fight is here in a battle of wills,
[1:33:50.560 --> 1:33:55.080]  and I don't have Soros or the media or the courts, I have you.
[1:33:55.080 --> 1:33:57.760]  And if you support us with your prayer and your word of mouth
[1:33:57.760 --> 1:33:59.760]  and your financial support, we're gonna keep fighting.
[1:33:59.760 --> 1:34:03.640]  If you don't, well, they win, at least that round.
[1:34:03.640 --> 1:34:05.240]  This is a critical battle, we need to win it.
[1:34:05.240 --> 1:34:06.800]  Thank you for the support.
[1:34:06.800 --> 1:34:08.360]  Let's, here on the Alex Jones show,
[1:34:08.360 --> 1:34:09.640]  start going to your calls,
[1:34:09.640 --> 1:34:11.840]  because the callers don't wanna call in about Russia
[1:34:11.840 --> 1:34:14.320]  or China or the border or any of this.
[1:34:14.320 --> 1:34:16.200]  They wanna talk about InfoWars, and I understand that,
[1:34:16.200 --> 1:34:17.400]  and I appreciate that,
[1:34:17.400 --> 1:34:19.840]  because this is really the destruction of free speech.
[1:34:19.840 --> 1:34:23.960]  This is all the censorship, the debanking, the lying,
[1:34:23.960 --> 1:34:26.280]  and just what they're doing.
[1:34:26.280 --> 1:34:29.360]  Let's go up to Bob in Ohio, Bob, welcome.
[1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:31.560]  Hi.
[1:34:31.560 --> 1:34:32.400]  Welcome.
[1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:33.720]  InfoWars, save the world.
[1:34:33.720 --> 1:34:36.800]  Alex, I ran a TV station, an NBC affiliate
[1:34:36.800 --> 1:34:39.120]  for the better part of a decade recently,
[1:34:39.120 --> 1:34:40.760]  but I know exactly what you're doing wrong,
[1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:43.320]  and I know exactly how to do a good for war.
[1:34:43.320 --> 1:34:44.240]  Let's move.
[1:34:44.240 --> 1:34:45.880]  John, listen.
[1:34:45.880 --> 1:34:49.320]  Okay, I believe what we need is resellers.
[1:34:49.320 --> 1:34:51.680]  You were once a great tree of liberty.
[1:34:51.680 --> 1:34:53.320]  You were a redwood of liberty,
[1:34:53.320 --> 1:34:55.240]  but when they pulled your advertisers,
[1:34:55.240 --> 1:34:57.320]  they effectively cut off all your branches.
[1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:01.720]  Now, when they pulled your branches,
[1:35:01.720 --> 1:35:04.120]  they effectively cut you down from a tree of liberty
[1:35:04.120 --> 1:35:04.960]  down to a bush.
[1:35:04.960 --> 1:35:06.800]  You are a shrubber of liberty.
[1:35:06.800 --> 1:35:08.280]  That's gotta be very insulting.
[1:35:09.720 --> 1:35:11.600]  Now, what we need to do to save InfoWars
[1:35:11.600 --> 1:35:13.840]  is we need to regrow your branches,
[1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:16.640]  and the way we do that is what I believe is resellers.
[1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:20.160]  We need tens of thousands of businesses
[1:35:20.160 --> 1:35:24.000]  to resell InfoWarsStory.com products in your local business.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:26.880]  I had a dream that I could go down to a local 7-Eleven
[1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:30.880]  to get TurboPort, so what do you think of that?
[1:35:30.880 --> 1:35:32.680]  Would that provide you with no funding?
[1:35:32.680 --> 1:35:33.520]  Well, of course it would.
[1:35:33.520 --> 1:35:37.720]  I mean, do you think 7-Eleven's gonna carry our stuff?
[1:35:37.720 --> 1:35:39.280]  Well, maybe not 7-Eleven,
[1:35:39.280 --> 1:35:41.280]  but I mean like a local mom and pop business
[1:35:41.280 --> 1:35:42.120]  with a family owned business.
[1:35:42.120 --> 1:35:44.080]  Yeah, I would love to have a reseller program
[1:35:44.080 --> 1:35:48.280]  where we sell stuff like 10% over our cost to people,
[1:35:48.280 --> 1:35:49.560]  and I would absolutely do that.
[1:35:49.560 --> 1:35:50.760]  It takes infrastructure,
[1:35:50.760 --> 1:35:53.640]  it takes money for me to even buy the product
[1:35:53.640 --> 1:35:55.400]  out of the future to be able to do that,
[1:35:55.400 --> 1:35:56.360]  and that's my problem,
[1:35:56.360 --> 1:35:58.440]  is I don't have all this capital,
[1:35:58.440 --> 1:36:00.720]  and I've spent so much capital battling
[1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:02.920]  and fighting all this litigious,
[1:36:02.920 --> 1:36:05.280]  lawfare Democrat attempts to shut me down.
[1:36:05.280 --> 1:36:07.120]  I appreciate your call, Bob.
[1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:08.240]  Great idea.
[1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:09.240]  Try to implement it.
[1:36:10.560 --> 1:36:13.240]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lauren in North Dakota.
[1:36:13.240 --> 1:36:14.080]  Welcome.
[1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:18.720]  Hello.
[1:36:18.720 --> 1:36:19.560]  Hey, welcome.
[1:36:19.560 --> 1:36:20.720]  Thank you for calling, Lauren.
[1:36:21.720 --> 1:36:22.840]  How are you doing?
[1:36:22.840 --> 1:36:24.800]  You know, I've actually been in a fight a long time,
[1:36:24.800 --> 1:36:27.720]  and I realized that I'm better than a baby getting aborted.
[1:36:27.720 --> 1:36:29.320]  I'm better than somebody dying in Ukraine.
[1:36:29.320 --> 1:36:30.520]  I'm doing actually pretty good,
[1:36:30.520 --> 1:36:32.760]  but they're taking Americans free speech.
[1:36:32.760 --> 1:36:34.080]  They've weaponized the courts,
[1:36:34.080 --> 1:36:36.160]  and our country's in a lot of trouble.
[1:36:37.320 --> 1:36:38.480]  Yeah, I would agree with you.
[1:36:38.480 --> 1:36:41.280]  I would say shame on anyone who listens
[1:36:41.280 --> 1:36:43.240]  and doesn't support or help,
[1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:45.920]  especially people who have the money to do it,
[1:36:45.920 --> 1:36:47.200]  because I know it's a lot of people
[1:36:47.200 --> 1:36:48.920]  who are pretty poor themselves,
[1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:50.840]  and given every dime they can to try to help
[1:36:50.840 --> 1:36:52.080]  as much as they can,
[1:36:52.080 --> 1:36:53.840]  because they don't have the resources.
[1:36:53.840 --> 1:36:55.640]  Well, I mean, I know billionaires,
[1:36:55.640 --> 1:36:56.600]  and they say, how can I help you?
[1:36:56.600 --> 1:36:59.320]  And I say, give me some money, and they never do it.
[1:36:59.320 --> 1:37:00.400]  I guess that's why they're billionaires,
[1:37:00.400 --> 1:37:01.920]  but the whole country collapses.
[1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:03.680]  They guess they can have their billions,
[1:37:03.680 --> 1:37:07.200]  but yeah, so many wealthy people sit on the sidelines
[1:37:07.200 --> 1:37:09.760]  while the common folks do all the work.
[1:37:09.760 --> 1:37:11.760]  That's okay, it's all right.
[1:37:11.760 --> 1:37:13.360]  I just appreciate your support.
[1:37:14.440 --> 1:37:15.960]  Well, what's on my mind here lately
[1:37:15.960 --> 1:37:18.480]  for a handful of weeks has been,
[1:37:18.480 --> 1:37:21.320]  you know how they have their Davos meetings
[1:37:21.320 --> 1:37:24.920]  and they strategize, they've been strategizing for years,
[1:37:24.920 --> 1:37:29.080]  and I don't actually see that happening in this country
[1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:31.320]  amongst the people who are fighting the hardest
[1:37:31.320 --> 1:37:33.080]  to protect it.
[1:37:33.080 --> 1:37:34.480]  You see a whole lot of people doing
[1:37:34.480 --> 1:37:37.160]  all their own individual thing,
[1:37:37.160 --> 1:37:38.520]  and their reach is decent,
[1:37:38.520 --> 1:37:40.800]  but I don't understand why there hasn't been
[1:37:40.800 --> 1:37:44.240]  any kind of bigger gathering of people
[1:37:44.240 --> 1:37:47.200]  to do the same thing the Davos group does
[1:37:47.200 --> 1:37:48.440]  and get together and strategize
[1:37:48.440 --> 1:37:49.280]  and figure out how to fight it.
[1:37:49.280 --> 1:37:51.080]  Well, that's right, they're the legion of doom.
[1:37:51.080 --> 1:37:52.680]  Where's the legion of liberty?
[1:37:53.600 --> 1:37:57.280]  Exactly, you know, it's been on my mind nonstop.
[1:37:57.280 --> 1:38:01.200]  It was pretty amazing to see every media outlet
[1:38:01.200 --> 1:38:03.040]  on the right side of this,
[1:38:03.040 --> 1:38:07.040]  almost relieved to see Elon Musk make a move on Twitter.
[1:38:07.040 --> 1:38:11.000]  And there's tons of venture capitalists out there
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:14.920]  tweeting back and forth, but where is like movement?
[1:38:14.920 --> 1:38:16.720]  Exactly, he's engaged in leadership,
[1:38:16.720 --> 1:38:17.800]  people should support him.
[1:38:17.800 --> 1:38:19.520]  Thank you so much, Lauren, for your support.
[1:38:19.520 --> 1:38:20.800]  God bless you.
[1:38:20.800 --> 1:38:22.760]  By the way, people ask where are leaders?
[1:38:22.760 --> 1:38:24.400]  Well, you saw what happened to Trump,
[1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:25.640]  you see what's happening to the Sanish,
[1:38:25.640 --> 1:38:27.280]  you see what's happening to the M4 Wars,
[1:38:27.280 --> 1:38:28.600]  you see what they're trying to do to Joe Rogan
[1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:31.760]  or Tucker Carlson, they stab Bolsonaro
[1:38:31.760 --> 1:38:33.000]  with an eight inch butcher knife,
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:37.080]  he barely survived, pierced several organs,
[1:38:37.080 --> 1:38:40.000]  they spent billions trying to overthrow Orban, that failed,
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:43.280]  they bought off Boris Johnson,
[1:38:44.440 --> 1:38:47.200]  and now Marilla Penn in the polls,
[1:38:47.200 --> 1:38:51.040]  as the election starts, is ahead of Macron,
[1:38:52.800 --> 1:38:54.280]  and so what's their response?
[1:38:56.080 --> 1:39:00.920]  EU exumes 18 year old embezzlement charge,
[1:39:00.920 --> 1:39:05.040]  so they dug it up, EU digs up 18 year old embezzlement charge
[1:39:05.040 --> 1:39:07.440]  to derail the Penn presidential bid,
[1:39:07.440 --> 1:39:09.600]  claimed that she bought dinners and paid for her
[1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:11.960]  transportation when she was a member of parliament
[1:39:11.960 --> 1:39:14.600]  18 years ago, and now they want to criminally charge her.
[1:39:14.600 --> 1:39:16.960]  I mean, give me a break.
[1:39:18.120 --> 1:39:20.560]  They've opened criminal investigations of Elon Musk
[1:39:20.560 --> 1:39:24.320]  and his companies, within six hours of him announcing
[1:39:24.320 --> 1:39:26.000]  a hostile takeover of Twitter.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:27.600]  So people say, where's the leadership?
[1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:32.600]  Well, they come after us folks, and it's starting to backfire,
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:37.760]  people are starting to get it, but we are the black sheep,
[1:39:37.760 --> 1:39:40.520]  we are the rebels, we are the patriots,
[1:39:40.520 --> 1:39:45.520]  we are the outlaws, and we need your support,
[1:39:45.560 --> 1:39:46.920]  and I know the general audience gets that,
[1:39:46.920 --> 1:39:49.760]  but I was telling you, of all the black sheep folks,
[1:39:49.760 --> 1:39:52.320]  of all the people the global estate is in for is the most,
[1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:54.560]  why, because we really have done the research,
[1:39:54.560 --> 1:39:58.760]  we got their number, and people in the establishment
[1:39:58.760 --> 1:40:01.240]  who aren't pure evil, they listen to us,
[1:40:01.240 --> 1:40:04.000]  world leaders listen, that's why we're so important,
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:05.600]  that's why you're so important.
[1:40:07.040 --> 1:40:10.680]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[1:40:10.680 --> 1:40:13.080]  Carlos in Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[1:40:14.120 --> 1:40:16.240]  Good afternoon, Alex, thank you.
[1:40:16.240 --> 1:40:17.080]  Thanks.
[1:40:18.080 --> 1:40:21.520]  There's so many subjects that are so paramount and important,
[1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:23.280]  I've been trying to rank order them,
[1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:26.280]  and I just can't figure out which one is most important,
[1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:28.360]  but I've narrowed it down to the real one
[1:40:28.360 --> 1:40:30.960]  that's important coming up in November,
[1:40:30.960 --> 1:40:34.600]  and that is that the vast majority of Americans today,
[1:40:34.600 --> 1:40:39.600]  in my personal opinion, are not able to elect people
[1:40:39.880 --> 1:40:42.400]  because they're not properly informed.
[1:40:42.400 --> 1:40:46.120]  This is an informed electorate is essentially in a democracy.
[1:40:46.120 --> 1:40:48.320]  It's not just a vote that's important,
[1:40:48.320 --> 1:40:51.440]  it's important that the people have information
[1:40:51.440 --> 1:40:54.680]  about what they're voting for and who they're voting for,
[1:40:54.680 --> 1:40:56.720]  and why they're voting for those people.
[1:40:56.720 --> 1:40:59.880]  Let's run, the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[1:40:59.880 --> 1:41:02.520]  Exactly, and it's been a deliberate dumb,
[1:41:02.520 --> 1:41:05.840]  dumbing down of the entire American population
[1:41:05.840 --> 1:41:07.640]  so that they don't understand the dynamics
[1:41:07.640 --> 1:41:09.240]  of government themselves.
[1:41:09.240 --> 1:41:12.480]  I happen to have been an observant of this long time,
[1:41:12.480 --> 1:41:14.640]  and I can tell you, the most important thing
[1:41:14.640 --> 1:41:17.160]  in America today is that you don't understand
[1:41:17.160 --> 1:41:19.360]  your own American voting system.
[1:41:19.360 --> 1:41:23.240]  For example, the Republicans and the Democrats
[1:41:23.240 --> 1:41:28.080]  have had a concerted effort to keep out anyone's third party
[1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:29.520]  from coming into office.
[1:41:29.520 --> 1:41:31.840]  This is an agreement that they seem to have
[1:41:31.840 --> 1:41:34.120]  tacitly at the very top level.
[1:41:34.120 --> 1:41:36.520]  President Trump, when he ran, he was opposed
[1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:39.760]  right from the inside of the Republican party.
[1:41:39.760 --> 1:41:42.560]  The way that these parties work at two systems
[1:41:42.560 --> 1:41:45.440]  in Canada as well, okay, is that when one party gets
[1:41:45.440 --> 1:41:48.320]  in trouble, the other party simply drops the ball,
[1:41:48.320 --> 1:41:51.840]  doesn't do, follows along, finds some sort of
[1:41:51.840 --> 1:41:56.360]  becoming a loyal opposition as opposed to a real opposition.
[1:41:56.360 --> 1:41:58.480]  They become a disloyal opposition,
[1:41:58.480 --> 1:41:59.960]  and then they drop the ball.
[1:41:59.960 --> 1:42:02.080]  Now, coming November, you think the Democrats
[1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:03.080]  are gonna get beaten.
[1:42:03.080 --> 1:42:04.800]  You bet not.
[1:42:04.800 --> 1:42:07.080]  You're gonna have the pollster saying that neck to neck,
[1:42:07.080 --> 1:42:10.360]  you're going to have the Republicans drop the ball,
[1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:12.480]  and they're gonna have some sort of agreement
[1:42:12.480 --> 1:42:15.080]  that, well, you can't allow the Democrat party
[1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:17.640]  to be destroyed because then that'll open the party
[1:42:17.640 --> 1:42:20.600]  to a third party, and we can't have that happen, blah, blah.
[1:42:20.600 --> 1:42:23.920]  And so you find the most incredible voting practices
[1:42:23.920 --> 1:42:26.920]  among Republicans that are shocking.
[1:42:26.920 --> 1:42:29.480]  And you say, how is it possible that Republicans
[1:42:29.480 --> 1:42:30.840]  can be voting in this way?
[1:42:30.840 --> 1:42:31.680]  That's because-
[1:42:31.680 --> 1:42:33.320]  And it's because there's insider deals
[1:42:33.320 --> 1:42:34.920]  at the committee chairman level,
[1:42:34.920 --> 1:42:36.360]  and that's how they control things,
[1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:37.200]  is by the leadership.
[1:42:37.200 --> 1:42:39.120]  Thank you so much, great point.
[1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:40.400]  But more and more people see through it.
[1:42:40.400 --> 1:42:42.280]  All right, bone crusher, Kevin,
[1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:45.040]  Jefferson, Peter, Paul, Josh, John, Alex,
[1:42:45.040 --> 1:42:46.720]  your calls are all coming up in the order
[1:42:46.720 --> 1:42:47.880]  they were received straight ahead.
[1:42:47.880 --> 1:42:49.440]  Thank you so much for calling.
[1:42:49.440 --> 1:42:50.880]  Thank you so much for caring.
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:52.640]  We're here, folks.
[1:42:52.640 --> 1:42:54.440]  We're gonna have to fight through this.
[1:42:56.400 --> 1:42:58.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[1:42:58.400 --> 1:43:01.840]  I need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong.
[1:43:01.840 --> 1:43:05.840]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[1:43:05.840 --> 1:43:06.880]  I was born for this.
[1:43:06.880 --> 1:43:07.880]  You were born for this,
[1:43:07.880 --> 1:43:10.480]  and people are really waking up right now,
[1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:12.920]  but we had to build our own infrastructure
[1:43:12.920 --> 1:43:15.480]  because of the censorship and deplatforming
[1:43:15.480 --> 1:43:17.040]  that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[1:43:17.040 --> 1:43:18.960]  And now, with Band-Aid video
[1:43:18.960 --> 1:43:21.120]  getting close to 10 million views a day,
[1:43:21.120 --> 1:43:23.160]  we're a platform for thousands
[1:43:23.160 --> 1:43:25.280]  of independent journalists and groups
[1:43:25.280 --> 1:43:28.600]  to be able to post their content free of charge.
[1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:33.280]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22.
[1:43:33.280 --> 1:43:36.640]  Info wars and Band-Aid video have become a mothership
[1:43:36.640 --> 1:43:39.520]  promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide,
[1:43:39.520 --> 1:43:43.200]  but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars
[1:43:43.200 --> 1:43:46.080]  a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[1:43:46.080 --> 1:43:49.240]  So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now.

[1:47:16.120 --> 1:47:20.120]  Oh, I guess that would be Bonecrusher in FEMA Region 10.
[1:47:20.120 --> 1:47:22.120]  I'm going to go ahead and show you.
[1:47:22.120 --> 1:47:24.120]  I'm going to go ahead and show you.

[1:47:36.120 --> 1:47:39.120]  Alex, great to see you're still hanging in there
[1:47:39.120 --> 1:47:43.120]  after all the crap that's going on right now.
[1:47:43.120 --> 1:47:45.120]  Well, thank you, brother. We're all in this together.
[1:47:45.120 --> 1:47:47.120]  I know.
[1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:51.120]  So I just want to say that I just ordered some stuff from the store
[1:47:51.120 --> 1:47:53.120]  and I was looking back at my history
[1:47:53.120 --> 1:47:55.120]  and I made an order.
[1:47:55.120 --> 1:47:58.120]  There was another one around about a year ago
[1:47:58.120 --> 1:48:02.120]  that there's been 600,000 orders
[1:48:02.120 --> 1:48:07.120]  that the whole entire website has done in about a year.
[1:48:07.120 --> 1:48:09.120]  That's ridiculous.
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:11.120]  There is so many people watching this stuff
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:13.120]  and for 600,000 orders
[1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:15.120]  to only come out of your guys' store
[1:48:15.120 --> 1:48:18.120]  within a year for how many people are watching this and stuff
[1:48:18.120 --> 1:48:19.120]  is absurd.
[1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:21.120]  I know we got that in the orders.
[1:48:21.120 --> 1:48:23.120]  I don't know where you got that number, but look, it's fine.
[1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:25.120]  Listen, I've run my course
[1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:27.120]  and nobody takes this stuff serious.
[1:48:27.120 --> 1:48:29.120]  We'll just go off the air. I mean, I'm not mad.
[1:48:29.120 --> 1:48:31.120]  I mean, if people don't want to support us,
[1:48:31.120 --> 1:48:33.120]  don't want to buy the products,
[1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:34.120]  don't want to keep us on there, that's fine.
[1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:35.120]  You're going to lose everything anyways.
[1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:37.120]  So I'm not bitching anybody.
[1:48:37.120 --> 1:48:39.120]  In fact, I'm tired of asking for support
[1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:41.120]  and I'm tired of the other sides lying
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:43.120]  and saying I got all these hundreds of millions of dollars
[1:48:43.120 --> 1:48:44.120]  and just all of it.
[1:48:44.120 --> 1:48:46.120]  Everybody's going to get what they want real soon.
[1:48:46.120 --> 1:48:47.120]  Stuff is going down.
[1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:49.120]  Things are falling apart now.
[1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:52.120]  The borders are open. Pedophilia is all over the news.
[1:48:52.120 --> 1:48:55.120]  We're just in the middle of the beginning of the end here
[1:48:55.120 --> 1:48:58.120]  and I guess it's just what we deserve.
[1:48:58.120 --> 1:49:01.120]  It's, well, I mean, yeah, if that's how,
[1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:03.120]  as a whole, that's what we deserve, but I'm mad about it.
[1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:04.120]  I think it's ridiculous.
[1:49:04.120 --> 1:49:07.120]  People don't realize that, go watch the Nightly News.
[1:49:07.120 --> 1:49:08.120]  You guys have ran it before.
[1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:09.120]  You guys have Montage.
[1:49:09.120 --> 1:49:11.120]  I've been up seeing it a million times,
[1:49:11.120 --> 1:49:13.120]  where it's showing the sponsors for the Nightly News.
[1:49:13.120 --> 1:49:15.120]  It's Big Pharma, Pfizer.
[1:49:15.120 --> 1:49:16.120]  It's Nestle.
[1:49:16.120 --> 1:49:17.120]  It's Coca-Cola.
[1:49:17.120 --> 1:49:19.120]  Everybody who's pumping junk into you.
[1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:21.120]  Well, everybody wants to sit here.
[1:49:21.120 --> 1:49:22.120]  All your naysayers want to go,
[1:49:22.120 --> 1:49:26.120]  oh, Alex Jones is selling, Alex Jones is selling snake oils.
[1:49:26.120 --> 1:49:28.120]  No, Alex Jones is selling good products
[1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:30.120]  and trying to keep himself afloat,
[1:49:30.120 --> 1:49:32.120]  because he doesn't have corporate sponsors.
[1:49:32.120 --> 1:49:33.120]  That's why.
[1:49:33.120 --> 1:49:34.120]  That's right, brother.
[1:49:34.120 --> 1:49:35.120]  I appreciate your call.
[1:49:35.120 --> 1:49:37.120]  But look, I'm not bitching at people.
[1:49:37.120 --> 1:49:38.120]  People want to keep us on air.
[1:49:38.120 --> 1:49:39.120]  They are.
[1:49:39.120 --> 1:49:41.120]  If they don't want to, that's fine.
[1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:42.120]  I've done my job.
[1:49:42.120 --> 1:49:43.120]  I've tried my best.
[1:49:43.120 --> 1:49:47.120]  And a lot of folks are supporting us right now.
[1:49:47.120 --> 1:49:50.120]  If we got the kind of support we're getting today,
[1:49:50.120 --> 1:49:52.120]  every day we'd be expand, actually.
[1:49:52.120 --> 1:49:54.120]  And so I'm not bitching at anybody.
[1:49:54.120 --> 1:49:55.120]  You want to support us, support us.
[1:49:55.120 --> 1:49:57.120]  We got great products that will enrich your life.
[1:49:57.120 --> 1:49:59.120]  infowarstore.com.
[1:49:59.120 --> 1:50:02.120]  Okay, let's go ahead now and let's take another call.
[1:50:02.120 --> 1:50:05.120]  Oh, by the way, I'm not mad, but there's an article.
[1:50:05.120 --> 1:50:12.120]  There's an article right here on infowarstore.com that says,
[1:50:12.120 --> 1:50:17.120]  global recession looming as China shuts down supply lanes.
[1:50:17.120 --> 1:50:19.120]  Look, we're not in a recession.
[1:50:19.120 --> 1:50:21.120]  We're in a global depression.
[1:50:21.120 --> 1:50:23.120]  They're shutting down the economy.
[1:50:23.120 --> 1:50:25.120]  Hundreds of millions are starving to death.
[1:50:25.120 --> 1:50:33.120]  So a lot of this is, we have become very comfortable with our
[1:50:33.120 --> 1:50:35.120]  own destruction.
[1:50:35.120 --> 1:50:39.120]  Well, I'm not comfortable with it.
[1:50:39.120 --> 1:50:44.120]  And so a lot of people think they're going through some
[1:50:44.120 --> 1:50:47.120]  metamorphosis of corruption and, oh, this great wonderful
[1:50:47.120 --> 1:50:49.120]  things are going to come out on the other side.
[1:50:49.120 --> 1:50:50.120]  That's what the left thinks.
[1:50:50.120 --> 1:50:52.120]  No, what's going to come out on the other side is mass death
[1:50:52.120 --> 1:50:54.120]  and nuclear war.
[1:50:54.120 --> 1:50:55.120]  Okay?
[1:50:55.120 --> 1:50:57.120]  So I've already made friends with this.
[1:50:57.120 --> 1:50:58.120]  I'm already way past it.
[1:50:58.120 --> 1:50:59.120]  And I don't want to take calls.
[1:50:59.120 --> 1:51:03.120]  In fact, I don't want to take calls about info wars anymore.
[1:51:03.120 --> 1:51:04.120]  I want to talk about Russia.
[1:51:04.120 --> 1:51:06.120]  I want to talk about China, the borders, the New World,
[1:51:06.120 --> 1:51:10.120]  or any subject but us, because it's just, it's whining.
[1:51:10.120 --> 1:51:11.120]  It's whining.
[1:51:11.120 --> 1:51:13.120]  If America doesn't believe in free speech,
[1:51:13.120 --> 1:51:15.120]  and America believes in killing babies,
[1:51:15.120 --> 1:51:17.120]  and America believes in drag queen story time,
[1:51:17.120 --> 1:51:20.120]  and America believes in open borders and tuberculosis
[1:51:20.120 --> 1:51:24.120]  and bio weapons being released and forced inoculations,
[1:51:24.120 --> 1:51:26.120]  then America's done.
[1:51:26.120 --> 1:51:29.120]  And my job was to be here to expose what was happening
[1:51:29.120 --> 1:51:32.120]  and to try to get people to make a mental,
[1:51:32.120 --> 1:51:33.120]  psychic, spiritual choice.
[1:51:33.120 --> 1:51:35.120]  And I've done that.
[1:51:35.120 --> 1:51:37.120]  But I sure as hell am not going to bitch.
[1:51:37.120 --> 1:51:40.120]  I'm just saying, you want to aid us in the fight against
[1:51:40.120 --> 1:51:41.120]  the New World Order.
[1:51:41.120 --> 1:51:42.120]  Weed your support.
[1:51:42.120 --> 1:51:45.120]  I don't want to turn it into bitching at people
[1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:47.120]  or turn it into complaining, okay?
[1:51:47.120 --> 1:51:50.120]  Because it's just, people are going to do what they're going to do.
[1:51:55.120 --> 1:51:58.120]  Let's go to Paul and Colorado on the midterm election fraud
[1:51:58.120 --> 1:51:59.120]  and moving forward.
[1:51:59.120 --> 1:52:02.120]  Yeah, how are we going to stop massive fraud by these crooks?
[1:52:02.120 --> 1:52:03.120]  They've already gotten away with it.
[1:52:03.120 --> 1:52:06.120]  They're trying to outlaw, questioning election fraud.
[1:52:06.120 --> 1:52:07.120]  What do you think is going to happen, Paul?
[1:52:07.120 --> 1:52:09.120]  How do we move forward?
[1:52:09.120 --> 1:52:12.120]  Alex, I've been wanting to make this call for 10 years
[1:52:12.120 --> 1:52:15.120]  and judging to Paul Atano and Gerald Sorrento
[1:52:15.120 --> 1:52:16.120]  are two of my heroes.
[1:52:16.120 --> 1:52:17.120]  So what a good Monday.
[1:52:17.120 --> 1:52:18.120]  What a good day to call.
[1:52:18.120 --> 1:52:21.120]  There's something that's important about elections
[1:52:21.120 --> 1:52:22.120]  that we can't forget about.
[1:52:22.120 --> 1:52:24.120]  And I'm going to go back to 2012.
[1:52:24.120 --> 1:52:26.120]  And if anybody hasn't seen it,
[1:52:26.120 --> 1:52:31.120]  look up the Ron Paul media blackout in 2012, okay?
[1:52:31.120 --> 1:52:34.120]  And this kind of goes to what one of the previous callers said
[1:52:34.120 --> 1:52:36.120]  about selecting our new leaders.
[1:52:36.120 --> 1:52:40.120]  And what we've been doing in the past is allowing the media
[1:52:40.120 --> 1:52:47.120]  to feed us our leaders by falsely reporting poll numbers, right?
[1:52:47.120 --> 1:52:53.120]  And so that same thing that blacked out Ron Paul in 2012
[1:52:53.120 --> 1:52:58.120]  is the same media deception that swept Bernie under the rug.
[1:52:58.120 --> 1:53:03.120]  It's the same media deception that fed us Donald Trump in 2016, okay?
[1:53:03.120 --> 1:53:04.120]  Whether they meant to or not.
[1:53:04.120 --> 1:53:06.120]  That's right, even though he meant well,
[1:53:06.120 --> 1:53:09.120]  he energized the left to commit a bunch of crimes
[1:53:09.120 --> 1:53:11.120]  and censor to bring in the New World Order.
[1:53:11.120 --> 1:53:12.120]  So Trump was...
[1:53:12.120 --> 1:53:15.120]  I agree with the head of Barstool Sports
[1:53:15.120 --> 1:53:18.120]  is that he's not against Trump personally,
[1:53:18.120 --> 1:53:21.120]  but Trump energized the left.
[1:53:21.120 --> 1:53:24.120]  So, yeah, and here's my point, though,
[1:53:24.120 --> 1:53:29.120]  is when you give somebody 400 mentions to one mention
[1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:30.120]  for every other candidate,
[1:53:30.120 --> 1:53:33.120]  you've delivered that candidate to the general...
[1:53:33.120 --> 1:53:35.120]  Well, we know the emails came out.
[1:53:35.120 --> 1:53:37.120]  Hillary ordered the media that she controlled
[1:53:37.120 --> 1:53:39.120]  to give Trump all the attention early on
[1:53:39.120 --> 1:53:42.120]  because she thought she could beat him easier than it backfired.
[1:53:42.120 --> 1:53:44.120]  So I agree totally.
[1:53:44.120 --> 1:53:46.120]  So here is my point,
[1:53:46.120 --> 1:53:48.120]  and this is going to be an unpopular opinion,
[1:53:48.120 --> 1:53:53.120]  but I'm willing to bet that Judge Napolitano and Gerald would agree with me
[1:53:53.120 --> 1:53:58.120]  is that in 2016, every vote that went to Donald Trump
[1:53:58.120 --> 1:54:01.120]  should have gone to Rand Paul.
[1:54:01.120 --> 1:54:03.120]  And we have to ask ourselves
[1:54:03.120 --> 1:54:06.120]  if Rand Paul would have been our president in 2016,
[1:54:06.120 --> 1:54:09.120]  would we really be in the situations we're in today?
[1:54:09.120 --> 1:54:10.120]  No, I agree.
[1:54:10.120 --> 1:54:12.120]  Rand Paul is a lot better than Trump in many ways,
[1:54:12.120 --> 1:54:18.120]  but Rand Paul supported the damn vaccine up front just like Trump.
[1:54:18.120 --> 1:54:21.120]  We got to think, though, you use the term tip of the spear often,
[1:54:21.120 --> 1:54:26.120]  and in Washington, D.C., Rand Paul is the tip of the spear.
[1:54:26.120 --> 1:54:28.120]  No, here he does a great job.
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:30.120]  Thank you, Paul, Jim, and all these great callers.
[1:54:30.120 --> 1:54:34.120]  All right, up next here.
[1:54:34.120 --> 1:54:37.120]  Let's talk to Josh in Minnesota.
[1:54:37.120 --> 1:54:39.120]  Josh, thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[1:54:39.120 --> 1:54:40.120]  Hi, Alex.
[1:54:40.120 --> 1:54:42.120]  First off, I just wanted to apologize to you.
[1:54:42.120 --> 1:54:46.120]  In 2021, you're talking about 2022 is the year of the big fight.
[1:54:46.120 --> 1:54:47.120]  We need to do it.
[1:54:47.120 --> 1:54:49.120]  And then in January, you walked off the air twice,
[1:54:49.120 --> 1:54:51.120]  and I don't want to say I took it personally,
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:52.120]  but like, you know what I mean?
[1:54:52.120 --> 1:54:53.120]  And then you came back,
[1:54:53.120 --> 1:54:55.120]  and that's why I want to say I'm sorry,
[1:54:55.120 --> 1:54:57.120]  because you really are out there fighting for us
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:54:59.120]  and fighting for what is right.
[1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:02.120]  Well, brother, I mean, I'm sorry that I have problems,
[1:55:02.120 --> 1:55:05.120]  and I mean, I'm definitely for real, though.
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:07.120]  I'm definitely who I say I am.
[1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:09.120]  I'm definitely don't lie to you folks.
[1:55:09.120 --> 1:55:11.120]  I mean, I had cops pull me over a year and a half ago,
[1:55:11.120 --> 1:55:12.120]  and they go, you've been drinking.
[1:55:12.120 --> 1:55:13.120]  I said, yeah, they took me to jail.
[1:55:13.120 --> 1:55:15.120]  I couldn't even lie to them.
[1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:17.120]  Remember other times in my life when I was a teenager,
[1:55:17.120 --> 1:55:18.120]  you'd been drinking?
[1:55:18.120 --> 1:55:20.120]  Oh, no, officer, I just couldn't even lie.
[1:55:20.120 --> 1:55:21.120]  Of course, I blew under.
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:22.120]  I told them I had two glasses of wine,
[1:55:22.120 --> 1:55:24.120]  which is supposedly legal,
[1:55:24.120 --> 1:55:26.120]  or somebody that weighs 260 pounds.
[1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:28.120]  But the point, and it got dropped,
[1:55:28.120 --> 1:55:31.120]  the point is I'm not lying to you.
[1:55:31.120 --> 1:55:33.120]  I'm telling you the truth here,
[1:55:33.120 --> 1:55:35.120]  and people need to know that.
[1:55:35.120 --> 1:55:36.120]  I understand that, Alex.
[1:55:36.120 --> 1:55:37.120]  You're an awesome man,
[1:55:37.120 --> 1:55:39.120]  and I really appreciate that about you.
[1:55:39.120 --> 1:55:40.120]  That's why I watch you every day for the last few years.
[1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:41.120]  I appreciate you putting up with me, brother.
[1:55:41.120 --> 1:55:43.120]  What's on your mind?
[1:55:43.120 --> 1:55:44.120]  I just wanted to say,
[1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:46.120]  I don't know what's going to happen with COVID stuff.
[1:55:46.120 --> 1:55:48.120]  I know you had Doug Stanhope on your show a few years ago,
[1:55:48.120 --> 1:55:50.120]  and you guys were like kind of going back and forth
[1:55:50.120 --> 1:55:51.120]  or whatever.
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:52.120]  Oh, they're bringing the lockdowns back.
[1:55:52.120 --> 1:55:54.120]  You can bet your bottom dollar on that.
[1:55:54.120 --> 1:55:55.120]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:55:55.120 --> 1:55:57.120]  But when it comes to whether or not you need food or not,
[1:55:57.120 --> 1:55:59.120]  you better bet on you're going to need it or not need it.
[1:55:59.120 --> 1:56:02.120]  So you should buy Ready Hour or Patriot Pantry,
[1:56:02.120 --> 1:56:03.120]  whichever one it is.
[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:04.120]  No, I agree.
[1:56:04.120 --> 1:56:06.120]  Everybody should be getting ready for full collapse,
[1:56:06.120 --> 1:56:08.120]  because it's not just a possibility now.
[1:56:08.120 --> 1:56:11.120]  It is a real probability.
[1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:12.120]  Okay?
[1:56:12.120 --> 1:56:15.120]  I mean, the question is how bad is the collapse going to be?
[1:56:15.120 --> 1:56:17.120]  There's no stopping it now.
[1:56:17.120 --> 1:56:18.120]  Exactly.
[1:56:18.120 --> 1:56:19.120]  Like, you can keep it in your truck.
[1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:20.120]  You can give it to homeless people.
[1:56:20.120 --> 1:56:21.120]  You can do whatever you want with it.
[1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:23.120]  So I would really recommend people to buy it,
[1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:25.120]  and at least at worst case scenario,
[1:56:25.120 --> 1:56:26.120]  you can be a good person.
[1:56:26.120 --> 1:56:29.120]  Or if you really do need it, then that's all I got.
[1:56:29.120 --> 1:56:31.120]  Thank you so much.
[1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:33.120]  I'd be prepared with Alex.com,
[1:56:33.120 --> 1:56:35.120]  but they're like three months behind their orders,
[1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:37.120]  unlike other places that would lie and say,
[1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:39.120]  oh, we got plenty of food when they don't.
[1:56:39.120 --> 1:56:41.120]  When they get behind, they tell you they're like three months behind.
[1:56:41.120 --> 1:56:43.120]  The supply chains are breaking down, but yeah.
[1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:44.120]  Prepare with Alex.com.
[1:56:44.120 --> 1:56:47.120]  And again, I'm just sick of sitting up and asking for support.
[1:56:47.120 --> 1:56:48.120]  We sell great products.
[1:56:48.120 --> 1:56:49.120]  We sell great things.
[1:56:49.120 --> 1:56:50.120]  We have a huge audience.
[1:56:50.120 --> 1:56:52.120]  If a small percentage bought the products,
[1:56:52.120 --> 1:56:53.120]  we would be in this situation.
[1:56:53.120 --> 1:56:54.120]  And I'm not bitching.
[1:56:54.120 --> 1:56:59.120]  But we have great products at m4works.com.
[1:56:59.120 --> 1:57:01.120]  And if you buy them, we stay on air.
[1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:02.120]  If you don't, we don't.
[1:57:02.120 --> 1:57:05.120]  And I just am maxed out with all these lawsuits and attacks,
[1:57:05.120 --> 1:57:07.120]  and I can't keep going, and I'm not lying to the public.
[1:57:07.120 --> 1:57:08.120]  I'm my syndicator.
[1:57:08.120 --> 1:57:09.120]  I run my own show.
[1:57:09.120 --> 1:57:10.120]  I pay for the bandwidth.
[1:57:10.120 --> 1:57:11.120]  I pay the crew.
[1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:12.120]  I pay the infrastructure.
[1:57:12.120 --> 1:57:13.120]  We do it all.
[1:57:13.120 --> 1:57:14.120]  We're not complaining.
[1:57:14.120 --> 1:57:17.120]  Hey, if you don't believe this is an important operation
[1:57:17.120 --> 1:57:19.120]  and you don't believe what you say on air, fine.
[1:57:19.120 --> 1:57:20.120]  I'm sick of doing this.
[1:57:20.120 --> 1:57:23.120]  I'll sit back and watch society burn down to the ground,
[1:57:23.120 --> 1:57:24.120]  quite frankly.
[1:57:24.120 --> 1:57:26.120]  You know, I was thinking five years ago,
[1:57:26.120 --> 1:57:28.120]  I wanted to like phase out within five years,
[1:57:28.120 --> 1:57:30.120]  because it's so hard to do this every day.
[1:57:30.120 --> 1:57:32.120]  And now, because of the attacks, I fight even harder.
[1:57:32.120 --> 1:57:35.120]  But like, hey, what if I just let them have what they want?
[1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:38.120]  I'd get into DMT of this, man.
[1:57:38.120 --> 1:57:39.120]  We'll be right back.
[1:57:39.120 --> 1:57:40.120]  We'll be right back with the next hour.
[1:57:40.120 --> 1:57:41.120]  Stay with us.
[1:57:47.120 --> 1:57:50.120]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand m4works.
[1:57:50.120 --> 1:57:51.120]  I've been on the air a couple of years,
[1:57:51.120 --> 1:57:54.120]  but I only had money to finance my own simple little
[1:57:54.120 --> 1:57:55.120]  local radio show.
[1:57:55.120 --> 1:57:57.120]  And I wanted to hire camera people.
[1:57:57.120 --> 1:57:58.120]  I wanted to make films.
[1:57:58.120 --> 1:58:00.120]  I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[1:58:00.120 --> 1:58:01.120]  And it was a t-shirt I designed.
[1:58:01.120 --> 1:58:05.120]  The first one, mass murderers agree gun control works
[1:58:05.120 --> 1:58:08.120]  that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew.
[1:58:08.120 --> 1:58:11.120]  That's our oldest design that we still sell.
[1:58:11.120 --> 1:58:13.120]  We have that design over 100 others
[1:58:13.120 --> 1:58:15.120]  that will now all be limited editions
[1:58:15.120 --> 1:58:17.120]  because whatever stock we've got in,
[1:58:17.120 --> 1:58:18.120]  that's it.
[1:58:18.120 --> 1:58:21.120]  We're selling everything out to fund the operation
[1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:22.120]  to get rid of inventory.
[1:58:22.120 --> 1:58:24.120]  We'll still have some t-shirts in the future.
[1:58:24.120 --> 1:58:26.120]  They'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[1:58:26.120 --> 1:58:29.120]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts,
[1:58:29.120 --> 1:58:30.120]  this is your last chance.
[1:58:30.120 --> 1:58:31.120]  I almost forgot.
[1:58:31.120 --> 1:58:35.120]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[1:58:35.120 --> 1:58:38.120]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie,
[1:58:38.120 --> 1:58:41.120]  every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts,
[1:58:41.120 --> 1:58:43.120]  designer shirts, they're all selling at cost
[1:58:43.120 --> 1:58:46.120]  infowarstore.com.
[1:58:46.120 --> 1:58:49.120]  You know, it's a fact, and I'm out bragging when I say it.
[1:58:49.120 --> 1:58:52.120]  It's just true that info wars is seen by the globalist
[1:58:52.120 --> 1:58:55.120]  as the standard of human liberty,
[1:58:55.120 --> 1:58:59.120]  as the logo of human populist resistance
[1:58:59.120 --> 1:59:03.120]  against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[1:59:03.120 --> 1:59:07.120]  And man, our work is really right now hitting
[1:59:07.120 --> 1:59:10.120]  the most important aspects of what we've ever done.
[1:59:10.120 --> 1:59:13.120]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize
[1:59:13.120 --> 1:59:16.120]  that we've got great products, thousands of them,
[1:59:16.120 --> 1:59:17.120]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:17.120 --> 1:59:20.120]  And we are funded by listeners and viewers like you.
[1:59:20.120 --> 1:59:23.120]  And so now we need to support more than ever
[1:59:23.120 --> 1:59:25.120]  because this fight has intensified.
[1:59:25.120 --> 1:59:28.120]  Don't need me to tell you that at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:28.120 --> 1:59:32.120]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now.
[1:59:32.120 --> 1:59:34.120]  Things have been sold out for a long time,
[1:59:34.120 --> 1:59:37.120]  like info wars life, fizzy magnesium mix,
[1:59:37.120 --> 1:59:40.120]  that's so amazing, and our new immune support formula
[1:59:40.120 --> 1:59:41.120]  that's so critical.
[1:59:41.120 --> 1:59:44.120]  They're all available 25 to 75% off
[1:59:44.120 --> 1:59:46.120]  at infowarstore.com right now.
[1:59:47.120 --> 1:59:51.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:59:51.120 --> 1:59:53.120]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:59:59.120 --> 2:00:06.120]  I looked into someone's eyes again
[2:00:06.120 --> 2:00:12.120]  and it's been all so long
[2:00:14.120 --> 2:00:21.120]  I've never been in talk again
[2:00:21.120 --> 2:00:25.120]  Wow, here we are in the year 2022.
[2:00:25.120 --> 2:00:27.120]  What an incredible time to be alive.
[2:00:27.120 --> 2:00:29.120]  What an amazing world.
[2:00:30.120 --> 2:00:32.120]  I am just so honored to know all of you.
[2:00:32.120 --> 2:00:35.120]  You're just, you're amazing people folks.
[2:00:35.120 --> 2:00:37.120]  Out of the whole world, you're the people who care
[2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:38.120]  about the New World Order.
[2:00:38.120 --> 2:00:40.120]  You're the people that way ahead of time knew
[2:00:40.120 --> 2:00:42.120]  what was happening and were actually supporting
[2:00:42.120 --> 2:00:44.120]  and resistance, so I want to salute you.
[2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:46.120]  It's an insult to even sit up here
[2:00:46.120 --> 2:00:48.120]  and ask for your support, quite frankly.
[2:00:48.120 --> 2:00:50.120]  You have the wisdom, you have the knowledge,
[2:00:50.120 --> 2:00:51.120]  you'll decide what to do.
[2:00:51.120 --> 2:00:52.120]  It's all in God's hands.
[2:00:52.120 --> 2:00:54.120]  I actually know you're worried about it.
[2:00:54.120 --> 2:00:57.120]  Let's go to a caller in North Carolina.
[2:00:57.120 --> 2:00:58.120]  Let's talk to Alex.
[2:00:58.120 --> 2:01:01.120]  Alex says he wants to talk about what's coming next.
[2:01:01.120 --> 2:01:03.120]  Boy, isn't that the big question?
[2:01:03.120 --> 2:01:05.120]  Alex, what's coming next?
[2:01:05.120 --> 2:01:07.120]  Yes, sir, how are you doing?
[2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:08.120]  How's your health?
[2:01:08.120 --> 2:01:09.120]  You know, I'm actually doing pretty good.
[2:01:09.120 --> 2:01:10.120]  I've been hiking lots and lots of weight,
[2:01:10.120 --> 2:01:12.120]  so I was like 15 pounds the last two weeks,
[2:01:12.120 --> 2:01:15.120]  and I decided to really start going crazy.
[2:01:15.120 --> 2:01:18.120]  The one thing I can control is my weight
[2:01:18.120 --> 2:01:20.120]  and what I'm doing, so I did some fasting
[2:01:20.120 --> 2:01:23.120]  a few weeks ago for two days, really felt good,
[2:01:23.120 --> 2:01:24.120]  and I'm going to do some more fasting,
[2:01:24.120 --> 2:01:26.120]  so I'm feeling pretty good, brother.
[2:01:26.120 --> 2:01:27.120]  Oh, that's great, man.
[2:01:27.120 --> 2:01:28.120]  Glad to hear that.
[2:01:28.120 --> 2:01:31.120]  You know, really quick, I just wanted to let you know
[2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:33.120]  that, you know, five years ago,
[2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:35.120]  I was at the Route 91 shooting,
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:38.120]  and the story that the media was telling us
[2:01:38.120 --> 2:01:41.120]  did not add up in our minds, so I did a lot of research,
[2:01:41.120 --> 2:01:43.120]  did a lot of digging, and that eventually led me
[2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:45.120]  to you guys and InfoWars,
[2:01:45.120 --> 2:01:48.120]  and I've been a notorious listener ever since.
[2:01:48.120 --> 2:01:51.120]  And, you know, once I found out, you know,
[2:01:51.120 --> 2:01:54.120]  most of what the truth was of what happened out there,
[2:01:54.120 --> 2:01:57.120]  my reality was essentially shattered,
[2:01:57.120 --> 2:02:00.120]  and I started doing digging on all sorts of topics,
[2:02:00.120 --> 2:02:02.120]  watching so many of your guys' videos,
[2:02:02.120 --> 2:02:06.120]  and, you know, I just can't believe that how, you know,
[2:02:06.120 --> 2:02:08.120]  malicious and evil the world actually is.
[2:02:08.120 --> 2:02:11.120]  It's not all sunshine and rainbows.
[2:02:11.120 --> 2:02:13.120]  I originally thought it was.
[2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:16.120]  So, you know, this leads me to my next question.
[2:02:16.120 --> 2:02:18.120]  You know, what is next?
[2:02:18.120 --> 2:02:21.120]  Because, you know, I've been, ever since that moment,
[2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:23.120]  I've been sharing a lot of your guys' videos and articles,
[2:02:23.120 --> 2:02:25.120]  you know, once on Blue Moon, but the last year
[2:02:25.120 --> 2:02:27.120]  and some change, you know, I've been, you know,
[2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:29.120]  pumping it out as much as I could,
[2:02:29.120 --> 2:02:31.120]  and I've been sharing your guys' products,
[2:02:31.120 --> 2:02:33.120]  and I've had a lot of friends and family, you know,
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:35.120]  start to call me, you know, crazy for believing all this stuff,
[2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:38.120]  and, you know, I don't know, you know,
[2:02:38.120 --> 2:02:41.120]  what else I could do on my here to kind of like lead people.
[2:02:41.120 --> 2:02:43.120]  Brother, you're doing it all.
[2:02:43.120 --> 2:02:45.120]  It's not people like you that we're asking to step up.
[2:02:45.120 --> 2:02:47.120]  It's those that haven't really done anything
[2:02:47.120 --> 2:02:49.120]  or rarely support.
[2:02:49.120 --> 2:02:51.120]  And, but don't you feel vindicated when you have
[2:02:51.120 --> 2:02:54.120]  the head of the Davos Group calling for the end of humanity
[2:02:54.120 --> 2:02:56.120]  and world government being announced
[2:02:56.120 --> 2:02:58.120]  and all these articles calling for dictatorship
[2:02:58.120 --> 2:03:00.120]  in the New York Times and what are supposed to mean?
[2:03:00.120 --> 2:03:02.120]  What is your family?
[2:03:02.120 --> 2:03:04.120]  Are they hiding under a rock?
[2:03:04.120 --> 2:03:06.120]  Don't they see what's happening?
[2:03:06.120 --> 2:03:08.120]  Yep.
[2:03:08.120 --> 2:03:10.120]  You know, I really wish, I really wish they did.
[2:03:10.120 --> 2:03:12.120]  You know, I've talked to them about the vaccine.
[2:03:12.120 --> 2:03:14.120]  You know, I'm the only one out of my family of five
[2:03:14.120 --> 2:03:17.120]  that has not gotten the vaccine.
[2:03:17.120 --> 2:03:19.120]  The shots, the boosters, you know,
[2:03:19.120 --> 2:03:21.120]  I'm a family of five. I'm a middle child.
[2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:23.120]  I'm 30 years old now.
[2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:25.120]  And yeah, they're just not buying it.
[2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:27.120]  They're buying everything.
[2:03:27.120 --> 2:03:29.120]  They're just telling them and, you know,
[2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:32.120]  I think the general consensus from what I've come across
[2:03:32.120 --> 2:03:34.120]  is people have lost their ability to think
[2:03:34.120 --> 2:03:36.120]  and just think critically in general.
[2:03:36.120 --> 2:03:39.120]  Well, that's right. They don't know the social contract's been broken.
[2:03:39.120 --> 2:03:42.120]  They don't get the systems predatory and that, yeah,
[2:03:42.120 --> 2:03:45.120]  the person at the vaccine center isn't bad.
[2:03:45.120 --> 2:03:47.120]  They're dumb like they are or ignorant.
[2:03:47.120 --> 2:03:50.120]  And so they just don't get what they've been hit by.
[2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:52.120]  And that's what the globalists are counting on
[2:03:52.120 --> 2:03:55.120]  is the learned helplessness, the Stockholm syndrome,
[2:03:55.120 --> 2:03:58.120]  the staying in a good mood even while they die
[2:03:58.120 --> 2:04:00.120]  and never wanting to blame anybody,
[2:04:00.120 --> 2:04:03.120]  never wanting to find out who did it. Do you understand?
[2:04:03.120 --> 2:04:05.120]  Yes, sir.
[2:04:05.120 --> 2:04:07.120]  Well, thank you for the call and God bless you, Alex.
[2:04:07.120 --> 2:04:10.120]  All right, Jefferson, Peter, John, we'll get to you.
[2:04:10.120 --> 2:04:14.120]  But Judge Andrew DePolitano is about to join us
[2:04:14.120 --> 2:04:19.120]  on a host of big issues on the other side of this break.
[2:04:19.120 --> 2:04:21.120]  I know that the phones are loaded up.
[2:04:21.120 --> 2:04:24.120]  We're getting thousands of calls to the operation.
[2:04:24.120 --> 2:04:26.120]  People are going to stay on air.
[2:04:26.120 --> 2:04:28.120]  Did you declare bankruptcy? What's really happening?
[2:04:28.120 --> 2:04:32.120]  And the answer is I did not declare personal bankruptcy.
[2:04:32.120 --> 2:04:36.120]  Free speech systems didn't, did, didn't,
[2:04:36.120 --> 2:04:39.120]  but some of the companies did so we can have
[2:04:39.120 --> 2:04:42.120]  a federal magistrate come in and look at everything
[2:04:42.120 --> 2:04:44.120]  so that in court people know we don't have
[2:04:44.120 --> 2:04:47.120]  $100 million hidden in a bank account
[2:04:47.120 --> 2:04:49.120]  because the left and these judges at the state level
[2:04:49.120 --> 2:04:51.120]  are doing that. It's just not true.
[2:04:51.120 --> 2:04:53.120]  So that's why I've done this.
[2:04:53.120 --> 2:04:55.120]  Stay with us.
[2:05:24.120 --> 2:05:27.120]  We're selling them for 15, selling them for 20,
[2:05:27.120 --> 2:05:28.120]  whatever the shirt costs.
[2:05:28.120 --> 2:05:31.120]  If a shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5
[2:05:31.120 --> 2:05:32.120]  for us to actually produce.
[2:05:32.120 --> 2:05:34.120]  It costs $10 or selling it for $10.
[2:05:34.120 --> 2:05:37.120]  And we've got hoodies and we've got long sleeves
[2:05:37.120 --> 2:05:38.120]  and we've got short sleeves.
[2:05:38.120 --> 2:05:40.120]  We've got them all and we've got to liquidate them all
[2:05:40.120 --> 2:05:43.120]  and they're limited edition because we're never
[2:05:43.120 --> 2:05:45.120]  going to make any of these designs.
[2:05:45.120 --> 2:05:48.120]  Again, we are going to come out with some new designs
[2:05:48.120 --> 2:05:50.120]  that will be limited and limited edition in the future.
[2:05:50.120 --> 2:05:53.120]  We've got to sell this to keep M4s on the air
[2:05:53.120 --> 2:05:55.120]  plus it spreads the word infowarstore.com
[2:05:55.120 --> 2:05:58.120]  to your historic apparel now infowarstore.com
[2:06:14.120 --> 2:06:16.120]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:06:16.120 --> 2:06:18.120]  Judge Andrew Napolitano,
[2:06:18.120 --> 2:06:21.120]  author, researcher, judge, good friend of mine,
[2:06:21.120 --> 2:06:24.120]  really smart person is here with us
[2:06:24.120 --> 2:06:26.120]  for the rest of the hour of the next 55 minutes
[2:06:26.120 --> 2:06:28.120]  and I really appreciate that.
[2:06:28.120 --> 2:06:30.120]  He wants to get into the ongoing Durham investigation
[2:06:30.120 --> 2:06:33.120]  and what came out about the FBI and CIA
[2:06:33.120 --> 2:06:35.120]  and the spying on Trump were all vindicated.
[2:06:35.120 --> 2:06:38.120]  He wants to get into some of the things happening
[2:06:38.120 --> 2:06:42.120]  with Elon Musk and what's going on with Twitter
[2:06:42.120 --> 2:06:45.120]  and also aborted babies discovered in D.C.
[2:06:45.120 --> 2:06:49.120]  may indicate infanticide after attempted abortions.
[2:06:49.120 --> 2:06:53.120]  He's a real expert when it comes to lay it all out
[2:06:53.120 --> 2:06:55.120]  but I first wanted to raise this
[2:06:55.120 --> 2:06:58.120]  because I remember him 10 years ago on Fox
[2:06:58.120 --> 2:07:00.120]  and five years ago on Fox
[2:07:00.120 --> 2:07:02.120]  and a couple years ago on Fox
[2:07:02.120 --> 2:07:05.120]  talking about how most of these terror plots
[2:07:05.120 --> 2:07:07.120]  whether it was militias or Muslims
[2:07:07.120 --> 2:07:11.120]  were hatched by the FBI and showing federal cases
[2:07:11.120 --> 2:07:16.120]  and since then another jury found a few people
[2:07:16.120 --> 2:07:19.120]  not guilty and also had a mistrial
[2:07:19.120 --> 2:07:22.120]  in the whole Whitmer situation
[2:07:22.120 --> 2:07:24.120]  and what's happening there.
[2:07:24.120 --> 2:07:27.120]  We know the same people that ran that situation in Michigan
[2:07:27.120 --> 2:07:29.120]  were involved in January 6th
[2:07:29.120 --> 2:07:31.120]  so a lot to unpack there.
[2:07:31.120 --> 2:07:34.120]  Judge Napolitano, thanks for coming on with us today.
[2:07:34.120 --> 2:07:38.120]  Let's try to tackle that first in your view on it.
[2:07:38.120 --> 2:07:42.120]  Well, Alex, it's always a pleasure to be with you.
[2:07:42.120 --> 2:07:44.120]  Thank you very much for having me on your show.
[2:07:44.120 --> 2:07:50.120]  The defeat for the government in a federal courtroom
[2:07:50.120 --> 2:07:52.120]  in Grand Rapids, Michigan last week
[2:07:52.120 --> 2:07:54.120]  was one of the greatest setbacks
[2:07:54.120 --> 2:07:59.120]  that the DOJ has endured in the past 10 or 15 years
[2:07:59.120 --> 2:08:02.120]  that was not on the top of the fold.
[2:08:02.120 --> 2:08:04.120]  It was not on the top of the fold
[2:08:04.120 --> 2:08:07.120]  because the New York Times and the Washington Post
[2:08:07.120 --> 2:08:11.120]  and their colleagues in the rest of the mainstream media
[2:08:11.120 --> 2:08:15.120]  were ardently hoping that these defendants would be convicted.
[2:08:15.120 --> 2:08:17.120]  I mean, the Times hates people like this.
[2:08:17.120 --> 2:08:19.120]  These are people who join a militia,
[2:08:19.120 --> 2:08:21.120]  a perfectly legal organization.
[2:08:21.120 --> 2:08:25.120]  They train with weapons, perfectly legal training
[2:08:25.120 --> 2:08:27.120]  and they are there to protect lives and property
[2:08:27.120 --> 2:08:29.120]  when and if the government fails to do so
[2:08:29.120 --> 2:08:32.120]  or when and if the government becomes the aggressor.
[2:08:32.120 --> 2:08:36.120]  Their group was infiltrated by FBI agents.
[2:08:36.120 --> 2:08:38.120]  There were more FBI agents in the group
[2:08:38.120 --> 2:08:42.120]  than there were people that were ultimately defendants in the case.
[2:08:42.120 --> 2:08:46.120]  The FBI planned and plotted, came up with the idea
[2:08:46.120 --> 2:08:49.120]  and paid for the training for the so-called
[2:08:49.120 --> 2:08:52.120]  plot to kidnap Governor Whitmer of Michigan.
[2:08:52.120 --> 2:08:55.120]  Now, whatever you think of her, she's one of the worst.
[2:08:55.120 --> 2:08:56.120]  She's a human being.
[2:08:56.120 --> 2:08:58.120]  She has the right to live
[2:08:58.120 --> 2:09:02.120]  and she has the right to be free from being kidnapped.
[2:09:02.120 --> 2:09:03.120]  The FBI knows this,
[2:09:03.120 --> 2:09:06.120]  but the FBI planted the seed of the crime
[2:09:06.120 --> 2:09:08.120]  in the heads of these defendants,
[2:09:08.120 --> 2:09:10.120]  scared the daylights out of two of the defendants,
[2:09:10.120 --> 2:09:14.120]  two pleaded guilty and testified against the remaining four.
[2:09:14.120 --> 2:09:17.120]  The jury did not buy the testimony.
[2:09:17.120 --> 2:09:19.120]  The jury did not buy the testimony
[2:09:19.120 --> 2:09:22.120]  of the undercover FBI agents.
[2:09:22.120 --> 2:09:23.120]  Of the four who were tried,
[2:09:23.120 --> 2:09:25.120]  two were outright found not guilty.
[2:09:25.120 --> 2:09:27.120]  They can't be tried again.
[2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:29.120]  Two were mistrials.
[2:09:29.120 --> 2:09:32.120]  I doubt the government will try them again
[2:09:32.120 --> 2:09:35.120]  because the government has spent millions on this case.
[2:09:35.120 --> 2:09:37.120]  We don't know the exact number, Alex,
[2:09:37.120 --> 2:09:40.120]  and the government has been utterly humiliated.
[2:09:40.120 --> 2:09:42.120]  These people will lose their jobs
[2:09:42.120 --> 2:09:45.120]  if they suffer another not guilty plea,
[2:09:45.120 --> 2:09:49.120]  a not guilty finding verdict by the jury.
[2:09:49.120 --> 2:09:51.120]  But you put your finger on it
[2:09:51.120 --> 2:09:54.120]  when you introduced this segment.
[2:09:54.120 --> 2:09:58.120]  How does the FBI decide who to target?
[2:09:58.120 --> 2:10:02.120]  What was the FBI doing on January 6th?
[2:10:02.120 --> 2:10:05.120]  What did they know and when did they know it?
[2:10:05.120 --> 2:10:09.120]  All of this information has not fully come out,
[2:10:09.120 --> 2:10:13.120]  even though this was a very happy ending
[2:10:13.120 --> 2:10:15.120]  for two people in this case
[2:10:15.120 --> 2:10:19.120]  and sort of happy and that they weren't convicted for two others.
[2:10:19.120 --> 2:10:22.120]  The judge made many rulings against them
[2:10:22.120 --> 2:10:24.120]  and barred a lot of testimony
[2:10:24.120 --> 2:10:26.120]  that the defendants tried to obtain
[2:10:26.120 --> 2:10:28.120]  how the FBI targeted them
[2:10:28.120 --> 2:10:31.120]  and what the FBI conversations were
[2:10:31.120 --> 2:10:33.120]  in Grand Rapids and where in Washington.
[2:10:33.120 --> 2:10:35.120]  They had a judge ruled against them on everything.
[2:10:35.120 --> 2:10:38.120]  Thank God we still have the jury system in this country.
[2:10:38.120 --> 2:10:41.120]  The judge ruled that it was not entrapment.
[2:10:41.120 --> 2:10:44.120]  The defendant can always make that argument to a jury.
[2:10:44.120 --> 2:10:47.120]  The jury accepted it. The jury has the final word.
[2:10:47.120 --> 2:10:50.120]  When will this happen again? We don't know.
[2:10:50.120 --> 2:10:54.120]  Who will the government target next? We don't know.
[2:10:54.120 --> 2:10:57.120]  What was the extent of government involvement in January 6th?
[2:10:57.120 --> 2:11:00.120]  We don't know. We probably won't find out
[2:11:00.120 --> 2:11:03.120]  until Stuart Rhodes is tried.
[2:11:03.120 --> 2:11:06.120]  He won't plead anything no matter what the government threatens
[2:11:06.120 --> 2:11:08.120]  or what the government offers
[2:11:08.120 --> 2:11:10.120]  because he's a true believer
[2:11:10.120 --> 2:11:13.120]  who wants to expose what the government did on that day
[2:11:13.120 --> 2:11:18.120]  to try to humiliate President Trump.
[2:11:18.120 --> 2:11:21.120]  Well, I know Stuart Rhodes and I knew some people involved
[2:11:21.120 --> 2:11:24.120]  and they did not tell me any of that if they actually did it.
[2:11:24.120 --> 2:11:27.120]  So I don't know if anything of those federal filings is real.
[2:11:27.120 --> 2:11:30.120]  I know this. The same feds that charged Rhodes
[2:11:30.120 --> 2:11:34.120]  were involved in Owen Shroyer's case, my co-host,
[2:11:34.120 --> 2:11:36.120]  and the host of the war room.
[2:11:36.120 --> 2:11:39.120]  They said Owen doesn't work here in the federal filing judge,
[2:11:39.120 --> 2:11:42.120]  Napolitano, and they said that he entered the Capitol
[2:11:42.120 --> 2:11:45.120]  in a filing. He does work here. He was with us.
[2:11:45.120 --> 2:11:48.120]  He tried to stop people entering. He didn't go in.
[2:11:48.120 --> 2:11:51.120]  So I can't believe anything the feds say
[2:11:51.120 --> 2:11:54.120]  when I know they're lying about Owen.
[2:11:54.120 --> 2:12:00.120]  Well, you know, the feds are allowed to lie under oath.
[2:12:00.120 --> 2:12:05.120]  But this is a crazy, crazy law
[2:12:05.120 --> 2:12:08.120]  that the FBI can lie to you, but you can't lie to them.
[2:12:08.120 --> 2:12:10.120]  The famous case is the Martha Stewart case
[2:12:10.120 --> 2:12:14.120]  and the same conversation which she lied to the FBI
[2:12:14.120 --> 2:12:17.120]  about what stock holdings she sold or what that day,
[2:12:17.120 --> 2:12:21.120]  they lied to her about whether or not she was a target.
[2:12:21.120 --> 2:12:24.120]  She was convicted of lying to the FBI and the FBI agent
[2:12:24.120 --> 2:12:27.120]  and the conversation was given a promotion.
[2:12:27.120 --> 2:12:29.120]  That's terribly, terribly wrong law.
[2:12:29.120 --> 2:12:35.120]  It is the law of the land and the FBI loves to charge people with it.
[2:12:35.120 --> 2:12:37.120]  They started all their conversations by saying,
[2:12:37.120 --> 2:12:40.120]  we're the FBI. If you're lying to us, you're going to go to jail.
[2:12:40.120 --> 2:12:44.120]  And it is true, judges do send people to jail for lying to the FBI,
[2:12:44.120 --> 2:12:47.120]  even if it's something that's not material.
[2:12:47.120 --> 2:12:51.120]  So it's the concept of lying by the federal government,
[2:12:51.120 --> 2:12:53.120]  particularly the Department of Justice,
[2:12:53.120 --> 2:12:55.120]  is not alien to the government.
[2:12:55.120 --> 2:12:57.120]  It's something they're accustomed to doing.
[2:12:57.120 --> 2:13:00.120]  Where they got this stuff about your colleague, God only knows.
[2:13:00.120 --> 2:13:02.120]  Why they said it, God only knows.
[2:13:02.120 --> 2:13:04.120]  I'd like to see the documents,
[2:13:04.120 --> 2:13:08.120]  because my guess is those documents were submitted under oath.
[2:13:08.120 --> 2:13:12.120]  It's one thing for the FBI to lie in a conversation
[2:13:12.120 --> 2:13:15.120]  with a defendant or a potential defendant.
[2:13:15.120 --> 2:13:19.120]  It's quite another thing for the FBI to lie under oath to a judge.
[2:13:19.120 --> 2:13:23.120]  Well, doesn't the FBI know they're destroying their credibility?
[2:13:23.120 --> 2:13:26.120]  And I guess they just don't care. They're going for broke.
[2:13:26.120 --> 2:13:28.120]  I guess they don't care.
[2:13:28.120 --> 2:13:32.120]  And in fairness, it's not all the FBI.
[2:13:32.120 --> 2:13:34.120]  There are FBI agents. Look at Mike German.
[2:13:34.120 --> 2:13:37.120]  We both know Mike German. Now he's retired.
[2:13:37.120 --> 2:13:44.120]  This serious libertarian FBI agent who spent his career in the FBI
[2:13:44.120 --> 2:13:46.120]  defending the Constitution.
[2:13:46.120 --> 2:13:50.120]  There are many FBI agents like that, not most, but many.
[2:13:50.120 --> 2:13:55.120]  There are other FBI agents to do whatever their bosses in the DOJ
[2:13:55.120 --> 2:13:56.120]  tell them to do it.
[2:13:56.120 --> 2:14:02.120]  In fairness to the FBI, imagine a DOJ run by the Trump administration.
[2:14:02.120 --> 2:14:08.120]  It's in the same FBI and the same DOJ run by the Biden administration.
[2:14:08.120 --> 2:14:11.120]  They have entirely different bosses, an entirely different culture,
[2:14:11.120 --> 2:14:15.120]  entirely different instructions, and they have to do what they're told.
[2:14:15.120 --> 2:14:17.120]  So sometimes they don't have a choice.
[2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:20.120]  They always have a choice when it comes to lying or breaking the law,
[2:14:20.120 --> 2:14:24.120]  but they often don't have a choice as to who they're going to target
[2:14:24.120 --> 2:14:26.120]  in criminal cases.
[2:14:26.120 --> 2:14:30.120]  All right, Judge Andrew Napolitano is with us for the rest of the hour.
[2:14:30.120 --> 2:14:32.120]  His website is JudgeNap.com.
[2:14:32.120 --> 2:14:36.120]  Podcasts, Judging Freedom, available on YouTube and everywhere else,
[2:14:36.120 --> 2:14:38.120]  really getting popular.
[2:14:38.120 --> 2:14:41.120]  Find his censored information at JudgeNap.com,
[2:14:41.120 --> 2:14:45.120]  or again, Judging Freedom, available on YouTube and other platforms.
[2:14:45.120 --> 2:14:49.120]  When we come back, we're going to get to the topics he wanted to hit.
[2:14:49.120 --> 2:14:56.120]  DOJ says CIA data that came from Clinton lawyer is not technically plausible.
[2:14:56.120 --> 2:15:01.120]  Elon Musk, we're going to get into so much more with him,
[2:15:01.120 --> 2:15:04.120]  the abortion laws trying to kill babies after they're born.
[2:15:04.120 --> 2:15:09.120]  All of this and more is coming up with Judge Nap today.
[2:15:09.120 --> 2:15:11.120]  Please don't forget.
[2:15:11.120 --> 2:15:15.120]  Yes, we've declared limited bankruptcy because I can't pay for these trials.
[2:15:15.120 --> 2:15:17.120]  I can't pay for all these lawsuits.
[2:15:17.120 --> 2:15:22.120]  And the Democrats suing me keep claiming I've got hundreds of millions of dollars.
[2:15:22.120 --> 2:15:25.120]  I don't have $3 million in extra cash.
[2:15:25.120 --> 2:15:30.120]  And so I want a federal court and magistrates to come in to set the amount so it's known.
[2:15:30.120 --> 2:15:35.120]  That's why I did this, because the Democrats are absolutely trying to shut down our free speech.
[2:15:35.120 --> 2:15:39.120]  And they're absolutely trying to lie to juries and tell them that I'm Daddy Warbucks.
[2:15:39.120 --> 2:15:43.120]  It'd be fine if I was, I wish I was, but it's just not true.
[2:15:43.120 --> 2:15:46.120]  We'll be right back on the other side, infowars.com.
[2:15:46.120 --> 2:15:48.120]  Tomorrow's news today.
[2:15:48.120 --> 2:15:55.120]  It's a revolutionary act against tyranny to share that link.
[2:16:18.120 --> 2:16:23.120]  And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalist making their main move.
[2:16:23.120 --> 2:16:25.120]  In full wars, it's paradoxical.
[2:16:25.120 --> 2:16:27.120]  It's more popular than ever.
[2:16:27.120 --> 2:16:29.120]  It is reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
[2:16:29.120 --> 2:16:35.120]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else,

[2:20:22.120 --> 2:20:31.120]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central, the Vaunted InfoWars is live.
[2:20:31.120 --> 2:20:41.120]  Despite everything, big tech and the Democratic Party and the establishment has done, you the listeners have held us in the sky like God holds the sun in the sky.
[2:20:41.120 --> 2:20:48.120]  Your gravity, your will has done it and I salute you and I thank you because you are everything we've got.
[2:20:48.120 --> 2:20:50.120]  And again, I just want to stay on this fight.
[2:20:50.120 --> 2:20:57.120]  Judge Andrew Napolitano valiantly has come out and exposed the illegal spying.
[2:20:57.120 --> 2:21:00.120]  He's exposed the election fraud.
[2:21:00.120 --> 2:21:10.120]  He has exposed so many things that scared the power structure and he's here with us today saying things that the system doesn't want you to hear.
[2:21:10.120 --> 2:21:19.120]  So let's get into this ongoing Durham investigation and the DOJ and saying the CIA has data from a Clinton lawyer that's not technically plausible.
[2:21:19.120 --> 2:21:21.120]  Explain how big this is.
[2:21:21.120 --> 2:21:27.120]  As I read Zero Edge and others saying this shows the CIA was spying, not just the DOJ was lying.
[2:21:27.120 --> 2:21:31.120]  What's really going on from an expert I like yours?
[2:21:31.120 --> 2:21:37.120]  All right, I just want to give you some breaking news that just came down, Alex, and it's very happy news.
[2:21:37.120 --> 2:21:46.120]  A federal judge in Florida has just invalidated the CDC mask mandate throughout the entire...
[2:21:46.120 --> 2:21:53.120]  This is almost too good to be true throughout the entire country on mass transit, on buses, trains, and planes.
[2:21:53.120 --> 2:21:56.120]  That mandate is gone as of an hour ago.
[2:21:56.120 --> 2:22:00.120]  Now, the feds will probably appeal it and who knows where that will go.
[2:22:00.120 --> 2:22:09.120]  But for the time being, she's written a 60 page opinion, which I did my best to read during the break basically saying Congress never gave the CDC the power.
[2:22:09.120 --> 2:22:15.120]  Let's get into the FBI, CIA, Trump spying in a moment.
[2:22:15.120 --> 2:22:18.120]  Because yeah, there's USA Today, put that headline back up.
[2:22:18.120 --> 2:22:25.120]  Judge overturns federal judge, Florida judge overturns CDC mask mandate for public transit and planes.
[2:22:25.120 --> 2:22:28.120]  This is a big deal. Tell us about this, Judge.
[2:22:28.120 --> 2:22:30.120]  This is a huge deal.
[2:22:30.120 --> 2:22:39.120]  So this judge first of all found that the Congress never gave the CDC the authority to regulate things like relations between landlords and tenants.
[2:22:39.120 --> 2:22:55.120]  We know that. And to tell you what to wear on your face, the CDC has authority to kill diseased animals and to suggest what medications people should take.
[2:22:55.120 --> 2:22:59.120]  But it doesn't have the authority to tell you what to wear on your face.
[2:22:59.120 --> 2:23:15.120]  It doesn't have the authority to interfere in the relationship between the customer, the passenger, and the owner of the means of passage, whether it's Amtrak, which is owned by the federal government, or whether it's an airline, which is owned by the shareholders.
[2:23:15.120 --> 2:23:29.120]  So the CDC, A, failed to give reasons, B, failed to give notice to the Congress that it was going to do this, to give Congress the opportunity to invalidate it.
[2:23:29.120 --> 2:23:31.120]  So those are the technical violations.
[2:23:31.120 --> 2:23:40.120]  But the constitutional violation is Congress never gave the CDC the authority to compel us to wear masks.
[2:23:40.120 --> 2:23:44.120]  And once and for all, a federal judge has just determined that.
[2:23:44.120 --> 2:23:59.120]  So if you take an airline flight today, this afternoon, Monday, April 18, 2022, three o'clock Eastern today, you don't have to wear that mask.
[2:23:59.120 --> 2:24:08.120]  Well, that is certainly great news because when it elapsed, as you know, a few weeks ago, Biden put it back in for 15 days and had a spokesperson say, just get used to it.
[2:24:08.120 --> 2:24:09.120]  It's never going to end.
[2:24:09.120 --> 2:24:17.120]  What do you think when we know it's prophylactic, when we know it doesn't, you know, long term do anything, even the better masks don't fully protect you.
[2:24:17.120 --> 2:24:18.120]  The regular ones do nothing.
[2:24:18.120 --> 2:24:20.120]  In fact, we have them on too long.
[2:24:20.120 --> 2:24:22.120]  They create bacterial pneumonia.
[2:24:22.120 --> 2:24:24.120]  Why on earth are they obsessed with these?
[2:24:24.120 --> 2:24:28.120]  Is it because it's a symbol of fear and their power?
[2:24:28.120 --> 2:24:42.120]  Yes, because the government likes to give the impression, and we talked about this earlier when the government creates artificial crimes and then solves these crimes, the government likes to give the impression it's a hero.
[2:24:42.120 --> 2:24:50.120]  When they arrested those people in Michigan that they claimed were going to kidnap the governor, the FBI was patting itself on the back for days and weeks.
[2:24:50.120 --> 2:24:55.120]  So the government does the same thing in different formats and different lanes.
[2:24:55.120 --> 2:25:00.120]  One is create crime, solve the crime, take credit for a crime that never existed.
[2:25:00.120 --> 2:25:03.120]  Another is make it look like we're doing something.
[2:25:03.120 --> 2:25:05.120]  Make it look like we're keeping you healthy.
[2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:12.120]  Make it look like we're keeping you safe and scare the daylights out of you while we're doing it so that you will do it voluntarily.
[2:25:12.120 --> 2:25:18.120]  We all know that these masks are more harmful than they are good.
[2:25:18.120 --> 2:25:23.120]  We also know that if somebody wants to wear a mask, they can wear the mask.
[2:25:23.120 --> 2:25:25.120]  The issue is not wearing the mask.
[2:25:25.120 --> 2:25:30.120]  The issue is the government has no power to compel you to wear the mask.
[2:25:30.120 --> 2:25:41.120]  So when they make up a rule and claim they can compel you to wear the mask, it looks like they're doing something and people will praise the government for doing something, doing anything.
[2:25:41.120 --> 2:25:48.120]  Whereas in reality, it's exceeding the Constitution, it's violating the law, and it's causing you harm.
[2:25:48.120 --> 2:25:56.120]  Well, for me, it is claustrophobic to fly on a five, six hour flight with a damn mask and then you're trying to drink a drink and they're bitching at you about it.
[2:25:56.120 --> 2:26:02.120]  And my question is, if the mask protects you, then you're wearing it, you're protected.
[2:26:02.120 --> 2:26:03.120]  Let me do what I want, same thing.
[2:26:03.120 --> 2:26:07.120]  Oh, you're not taking an injection and an oculation, so you're going to make me sick.
[2:26:07.120 --> 2:26:13.120]  Wait a minute, I thought this shot protects you, then why don't you let me be an idiot and not take it?
[2:26:13.120 --> 2:26:16.120]  It's just the logic is out the window, Judge.
[2:26:16.120 --> 2:26:20.120]  Because the government doesn't believe in giving us choices.
[2:26:20.120 --> 2:26:22.120]  The left doesn't believe in choices.
[2:26:22.120 --> 2:26:25.120]  There are even people on the right that don't believe in choices.
[2:26:25.120 --> 2:26:31.120]  The government wants to tell us how to live because it thinks it knows what's better for us than we know for ourselves.
[2:26:31.120 --> 2:26:35.120]  That's why I said, you want to wear a mask on a plane, go ahead and wear it.
[2:26:35.120 --> 2:26:38.120]  But the government has no authority to compel you.
[2:26:38.120 --> 2:26:46.120]  So the government's rule says you can take the mask off when you're eating and when you're drinking.
[2:26:46.120 --> 2:26:53.120]  As if the virus knows not to come out of your mouth when you're eating and drinking.
[2:26:53.120 --> 2:26:59.120]  But you can't take the mask off when you're talking, when you're reading or when you're sleeping.
[2:26:59.120 --> 2:27:08.120]  So because of that absurd inconsistency, the court found there was no rational basis for the rule.
[2:27:08.120 --> 2:27:14.120]  Everything the government does, theoretically and under the Constitution, has to have a rational basis.
[2:27:14.120 --> 2:27:23.120]  If the government has no basis, or if the government's basis is irrational, or if the government's basis exceeds the authority given to it by the Constitution,
[2:27:23.120 --> 2:27:27.120]  then the government's behavior is unconstitutional and should be enjoined.
[2:27:27.120 --> 2:27:36.120]  God bless this judge. A lot of judges would have said, I'm going to enjoin you, but I'm going to stay my own rolling until an appellate court can roll.
[2:27:36.120 --> 2:27:40.120]  She didn't do that. She enjoined the feds immediately.
[2:27:40.120 --> 2:27:44.120]  So now it's up to the airlines, but the airlines don't want the masks.
[2:27:44.120 --> 2:27:53.120]  The airline spent two hours in the Oval Office begging old Joe not to extend the mask roll last week, and they didn't succeed.
[2:27:53.120 --> 2:27:58.120]  But these private litigants succeeded in a federal courtroom in Miami just a few hours ago.
[2:27:58.120 --> 2:28:02.120]  Well, I'm so glad, Judge Andrew DePaulitone, you were here while this broke today.
[2:28:02.120 --> 2:28:07.120]  You've got a bunch of big subjects you want to raise, but here in my stack, I want to ask you about this in the last segment.
[2:28:07.120 --> 2:28:13.120]  Next time we'll get into the Durham investigation, the huge developments there that are so big with the permanent deep state.
[2:28:13.120 --> 2:28:26.120]  But then later, I'm sure you've seen the Washington Post, the New York Times, Bloomberg Financial Times, all calling for dictatorship now saying dictatorships are good and that that is what we need.
[2:28:26.120 --> 2:28:32.120]  So we're going to be looking at some of that with Judge Knapp on the other side of this quick break as well.
[2:28:32.120 --> 2:28:37.120]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, there's so much censorship of populistic conservative libertarian news.
[2:28:37.120 --> 2:28:46.120]  We have millions listening right now, but if the millions listening tell friends, neighbors, families, strangers about the show and tell them to tell folks it causes the chain reaction.
[2:28:46.120 --> 2:29:08.120]  So remember, we're in a revolution. It's not a spectator sport. We need your help now to spread the word. But right back with Judge Knapp.
[2:29:16.120 --> 2:29:26.120]  That is all sorts of designer shirts that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce. We used to sell for $40. We're selling them for $15, selling them for $20.
[2:29:26.120 --> 2:29:33.120]  Whatever the shirt costs us, the shirt costs $5. We're selling it for $5 for us to actually produce. It costs $10. We're selling it for $10.
[2:29:33.120 --> 2:29:39.120]  And we've got hoodies and we've got long sleeves and we've got short sleeves. We've got them all and we've got to liquidate them all.
[2:29:39.120 --> 2:29:43.120]  And they're limited edition because we're never going to make any of these designs.
[2:29:43.120 --> 2:29:49.120]  Again, we are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited, limited edition in the future.
[2:29:49.120 --> 2:29:53.120]  We've got to sell this to keep M4s on the air, plus it spreads the word.
[2:29:53.120 --> 2:30:15.120]  M4WarStore.com, your historic apparel now, M4WarStore.com.
[2:30:23.120 --> 2:30:32.120]  Concentrated elderberry, concentrated echinacea, concentrated astragalus root, angelica root, loatium root, and more.
[2:30:32.120 --> 2:30:42.120]  This product is incredible. M4War's immune support, exclusively available at M4WarStore.com, is funding the tip of the spear, the M4War's operation.
[2:30:42.120 --> 2:30:50.120]  It is a 360 win. The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's natural defenses and keep M4War's on the air.
[2:30:50.120 --> 2:30:57.120]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action. Take action now. M4WarStore.com.
[2:30:57.120 --> 2:31:02.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help. I need your help keeping M4War's on the air and strong.
[2:31:02.120 --> 2:31:06.120]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[2:31:06.120 --> 2:31:11.120]  I was born for this. You were born for this and people are really waking up right now.
[2:31:11.120 --> 2:31:18.120]  But we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[2:31:18.120 --> 2:31:30.120]  And now, with Band-Aught Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge.
[2:31:30.120 --> 2:31:34.120]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[2:31:34.120 --> 2:31:40.120]  M4War's and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide.
[2:31:40.120 --> 2:31:47.120]  But the expenses in Band-With alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[2:31:47.120 --> 2:31:57.120]  So, the biggest sale in M4War's history is going right now, the mega-emergency blowout sale up to 75% off, getting incredible products and keeping M4War's as strong as ever.
[2:31:57.120 --> 2:32:15.120]  If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep prince that the general public is in, the best word would actually be the people are lost.
[2:32:15.120 --> 2:32:29.120]  Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare or you're in a car or you get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused, you have a concussion.
[2:32:29.120 --> 2:32:32.120]  And that's what the globalists have done, they have stunned us.
[2:32:32.120 --> 2:32:36.120]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings.
[2:32:36.120 --> 2:32:42.120]  And then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave a speech called The Great New Narrative, where he brags how the public is lost,
[2:32:42.120 --> 2:32:49.120]  how the culture in the media has been driven to make sure the people are all alone so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[2:32:49.120 --> 2:32:51.120]  That's what the Great Recent is.
[2:32:51.120 --> 2:32:53.120]  They need darkness to thrive.
[2:32:53.120 --> 2:33:14.120]  Light lives at infowars.com.
[2:33:23.120 --> 2:33:35.120]  So I remember watching Judd Jandrud and Paula Tano 15, 16, 17 years ago on Fox News and also listened to him on the radio,
[2:33:35.120 --> 2:33:41.120]  warned about if we erode American freedoms and do process, we're all going to lose.
[2:33:41.120 --> 2:33:51.120]  And then now here we are in the year 2022, and I have videos we played last week of Klaus Schwab and his main spokesperson, Noah Harari,
[2:33:51.120 --> 2:33:59.120]  and others saying, your free will's gone, robots will control everything you do, and humanities are a horrible species.
[2:33:59.120 --> 2:34:06.120]  And then now Dallas, Texas at Lovefield has seven-foot robots that bark orders and scream at you if you're not wearing a mask.
[2:34:06.120 --> 2:34:10.120]  I mean, that's way crazier than the stuff I said 10 years ago.
[2:34:10.120 --> 2:34:12.120]  And believe me, I'm not glad I've been vindicated.
[2:34:12.120 --> 2:34:20.120]  Well, then I look at this, suddenly, all over the Twitter and the Instagram, without even looking, I've got stuff like this.
[2:34:20.120 --> 2:34:23.120]  The National Times of London, that is the voice of the establishment.
[2:34:23.120 --> 2:34:27.120]  Democracy works better when there is less of it.
[2:34:27.120 --> 2:34:29.120]  Autocracy is what we need.
[2:34:29.120 --> 2:34:36.120]  Bloomberg, to save democracy, we need a few good dictators.
[2:34:36.120 --> 2:34:41.120]  Washington Post, it's time to give the elites a bigger say in choosing the president.
[2:34:41.120 --> 2:34:42.120]  There's more of these.
[2:34:42.120 --> 2:34:49.120]  I mean, we are in this situation because of having these establishment people who are out of control.
[2:34:49.120 --> 2:34:54.120]  Judge, I want to get into the other big issues with you, but just as a judge, as a talk show host, as an American,
[2:34:54.120 --> 2:35:00.120]  what is it like to just see them go from denying they want tyranny, or denying they want to take our guns,
[2:35:00.120 --> 2:35:04.120]  to hell yes, we're going to take your guns, and hell yes, we're going to make you take a shot,
[2:35:04.120 --> 2:35:07.120]  and hell yes, we're going to have robots control your life.
[2:35:07.120 --> 2:35:14.120]  It's like this is, but then paradoxically, those of us that say it's bad, the media says we're crazy, it doesn't exist.
[2:35:14.120 --> 2:35:17.120]  What do you call that, Judge?
[2:35:17.120 --> 2:35:25.120]  I call it terrifying, Alex, and I call you prescient for having warned against these things.
[2:35:25.120 --> 2:35:29.120]  Some of us suffer dearly when we warned against what big government was doing,
[2:35:29.120 --> 2:35:34.120]  whether it was a foreign government doing its bidding at the American government's request,
[2:35:34.120 --> 2:35:37.120]  so the American government could have plausible deniability,
[2:35:37.120 --> 2:35:47.120]  or whether it's the elites finally admitting that because they are better, brighter, stronger, richer, smarter,
[2:35:47.120 --> 2:35:50.120]  in their own view, that they should run the world.
[2:35:50.120 --> 2:35:53.120]  In the dictatorship, there is no choice.
[2:35:53.120 --> 2:35:59.120]  The elections are controlled, the police of the military, fear equals control, speech is suppressed,
[2:35:59.120 --> 2:36:03.120]  the economy is looted, the people are slaves.
[2:36:03.120 --> 2:36:09.120]  That's you, that's you 10 years ago when people laughed at you for saying that.
[2:36:09.120 --> 2:36:13.120]  Today, as you just pointed out by showing everybody, including me,
[2:36:13.120 --> 2:36:19.120]  the headlines from the newspapers in the past 48 hours over the Easter weekend,
[2:36:19.120 --> 2:36:24.120]  it's practically acknowledged that this is what they're trying to do.
[2:36:24.120 --> 2:36:30.120]  I mean, the left is trying to get babies, five-year-old kids to change their genders.
[2:36:30.120 --> 2:36:34.120]  And I want to talk to that. That's in your stack. Let's get into that now.
[2:36:34.120 --> 2:36:36.120]  Let's hit that now, and then we'll get into the DOJ stuff.
[2:36:36.120 --> 2:36:39.120]  You sent me these incredible articles. I didn't even know about these latest ones.
[2:36:39.120 --> 2:36:44.120]  Aborted babies discovered in D.C. may indicate infanticide.
[2:36:44.120 --> 2:36:48.120]  You've got some other articles about that. What's your view on this?
[2:36:48.120 --> 2:36:51.120]  Well, I believe abortion is homicide.
[2:36:51.120 --> 2:36:57.120]  But the law in D.C. says if the baby comes out alive,
[2:36:57.120 --> 2:37:00.120]  this is disgusting what I'm about to tell you.
[2:37:00.120 --> 2:37:03.120]  The doctor can let the baby starve to death.
[2:37:03.120 --> 2:37:09.120]  But if the baby comes out alive and the doctor personally kills the baby, that's homicide.
[2:37:09.120 --> 2:37:13.120]  So somebody took five photographs. These things are very difficult to look at.
[2:37:13.120 --> 2:37:15.120]  I'm glad your guys are blurring them a little bit.
[2:37:15.120 --> 2:37:22.120]  Somebody took five photographs of babies in a trash can in Washington, D.C.
[2:37:22.120 --> 2:37:25.120]  that belonged to an abortion facility.
[2:37:25.120 --> 2:37:32.120]  The police took the babies to have autopsies performed to see if they were murdered
[2:37:32.120 --> 2:37:36.120]  after they came out of the mother's womb.
[2:37:36.120 --> 2:37:40.120]  And by the way, for those who are watching, viewer discretion is advised.
[2:37:40.120 --> 2:37:43.120]  I think on the record, I've given people a warning. I'm going to show the photos,
[2:37:43.120 --> 2:37:46.120]  because this is what happened. Keep going, Judge.
[2:37:46.120 --> 2:37:54.120]  I mean, the photos show it appears that these babies were scalded to death with acid,
[2:37:54.120 --> 2:37:56.120]  but we don't know exactly what happened.
[2:37:56.120 --> 2:38:00.120]  We don't know if they were still living and still feeling pain.
[2:38:00.120 --> 2:38:07.120]  You know, the reaction on the part of the left to the fear that the Supreme Court will invalidate Roe vs. Wade,
[2:38:07.120 --> 2:38:10.120]  I think it's a legitimate fear, I think the court will invalidate it,
[2:38:10.120 --> 2:38:15.120]  has been in Washington, D.C., in California, and sadly where I am now,
[2:38:15.120 --> 2:38:23.120]  my home state of New Jersey, to make abortion lawful up to the moment of birth.
[2:38:23.120 --> 2:38:27.120]  And in all three places, if you can't afford it, the government will pay for it for you.
[2:38:27.120 --> 2:38:35.120]  But what was discovered over the weekend may have been abortions committed after birth,
[2:38:35.120 --> 2:38:42.120]  after the baby came out alive and intact, the homicide was committed.
[2:38:42.120 --> 2:38:44.120]  To me, all abortion is homicide.
[2:38:44.120 --> 2:38:49.120]  The government's most profound obligation is to preserve, protect, and defend human life.
[2:38:49.120 --> 2:38:53.120]  You're right, this is totally cut and dried. These are viable babies outside the womb for adoption.
[2:38:53.120 --> 2:39:01.120]  And as we know, they either drown them or put them in a bed of acid, which again violates the law of killing the baby.
[2:39:01.120 --> 2:39:05.120]  It's just incredible. How do any of us feel safe if we have no empathy?
[2:39:05.120 --> 2:39:07.120]  Because I'm for animal rights too, some basic ones.
[2:39:07.120 --> 2:39:10.120]  But what about human rights here? What about rights of babies?
[2:39:10.120 --> 2:39:12.120]  Treatment at least as good as lab rats.
[2:39:12.120 --> 2:39:17.120]  The left all got mad that Fauci had beagles strapped into these cages with flesh-eating bugs.
[2:39:17.120 --> 2:39:21.120]  I'm totally against that. But how about we don't do it to babies either, Judge?
[2:39:21.120 --> 2:39:24.120]  Correct, correct. You're 100% correct.
[2:39:24.120 --> 2:39:28.120]  But the same crowd that will defend the rights of animals, and I'm an animal lover too.
[2:39:28.120 --> 2:39:34.120]  My Chris is all over the place. He loves to, my Beagle German Shepherd makes. He loves to get on camera.
[2:39:34.120 --> 2:39:42.120]  The same crowd that will defend the right of animals will have nothing to do with the right of babies in the womb.
[2:39:42.120 --> 2:39:48.120]  Because their goal is to destroy the family, because the family is the basis,
[2:39:48.120 --> 2:39:51.120]  the structure for freedom in western civilization.
[2:39:51.120 --> 2:39:56.120]  And the left, which wants one world government, it wants the government to control everything,
[2:39:56.120 --> 2:39:59.120]  is beginning at the bottom by destroying the family.
[2:39:59.120 --> 2:40:04.120]  That's why also here in New Jersey, again it's sickening and sad to say,
[2:40:04.120 --> 2:40:12.120]  the Department of Education issued regulations to every second grade teacher in the state,
[2:40:12.120 --> 2:40:18.120]  those kids are six and seven years old, to tell them that they can change their gender,
[2:40:18.120 --> 2:40:23.120]  and they can change their sexual identity because, quote, now I'm going to use a quote,
[2:40:23.120 --> 2:40:30.120]  it's a little off-putting, but it's a quote, you don't have to have a penis to be a boy.
[2:40:30.120 --> 2:40:37.120]  Now the reaction to that was so extreme, even on the part of blue collar,
[2:40:37.120 --> 2:40:45.120]  mainly Catholic Democrats, that the governor himself, who's a hard lefty authoritarian,
[2:40:45.120 --> 2:40:49.120]  who wants to succeed Joe Biden in the White House, Phil Murphy,
[2:40:49.120 --> 2:40:53.120]  first claimed he had, didn't know anything about it, then he claimed he had nothing to do with it,
[2:40:53.120 --> 2:40:57.120]  now he's asked the education department to revisit it.
[2:40:57.120 --> 2:41:01.120]  But until three or four days ago, all these second grade teachers were told,
[2:41:01.120 --> 2:41:05.120]  starting in September, this is what you must tell these kids.
[2:41:05.120 --> 2:41:09.120]  And they literally teach children, self-harm, cut your genitals off.
[2:41:09.120 --> 2:41:12.120]  This is like a satanic hallucination, it doesn't even make sense.
[2:41:12.120 --> 2:41:15.120]  It has nothing to do with gay rights or any of that stuff.
[2:41:15.120 --> 2:41:18.120]  This is literally the state in a weird medical cult,
[2:41:18.120 --> 2:41:22.120]  wanting to form a relationship with little children, not just to have sex with them,
[2:41:22.120 --> 2:41:25.120]  that'd be bad enough, but to teach them they're another gender,
[2:41:25.120 --> 2:41:27.120]  and then line them up to be sterilized.
[2:41:27.120 --> 2:41:30.120]  I mean, that's abominable.
[2:41:30.120 --> 2:41:38.120]  This is child abuse, and it violates a terrific opinion by the Supreme Court,
[2:41:38.120 --> 2:41:42.120]  which basically says the relationship between the parent and the child
[2:41:42.120 --> 2:41:48.120]  is the highest, most protected relationship, protected from the government
[2:41:48.120 --> 2:41:51.120]  that we have in the country.
[2:41:51.120 --> 2:41:54.120]  And the government, remember, I don't call them public schools,
[2:41:54.120 --> 2:41:56.120]  they're government schools.
[2:41:56.120 --> 2:42:00.120]  The government has no business intruding itself in that relationship.
[2:42:00.120 --> 2:42:03.120]  It's up to the parents that decide when those kids should learn
[2:42:03.120 --> 2:42:07.120]  and what they should learn about sexuality, to which Governor Murphy said,
[2:42:07.120 --> 2:42:11.120]  well, the parent can get the kid excluded from class if he wants.
[2:42:11.120 --> 2:42:13.120]  That's not good enough.
[2:42:13.120 --> 2:42:15.120]  Those kids will be ridiculed by their...
[2:42:15.120 --> 2:42:16.120]  Unbelievable.
[2:42:16.120 --> 2:42:18.120]  I mean, children are very impressionable.
[2:42:18.120 --> 2:42:21.120]  I know when I was in elementary, I did whatever the teacher said,
[2:42:21.120 --> 2:42:24.120]  I wanted to do a good job, and the teacher's not teaching, I ought to do math
[2:42:24.120 --> 2:42:28.120]  or art or literature or PE.
[2:42:28.120 --> 2:42:33.120]  You're learning about weird sex stuff I didn't learn about till I was a teenager.
[2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:34.120]  This is insane.
[2:42:34.120 --> 2:42:38.120]  Final segment with Judge January Palatano, who, by the way, has great Skype.
[2:42:38.120 --> 2:42:40.120]  He looks like he's in studio with us.
[2:42:40.120 --> 2:42:41.120]  Looks great there.
[2:42:41.120 --> 2:42:42.120]  I love it.
[2:42:42.120 --> 2:42:43.120]  So good to have him here with us.
[2:42:43.120 --> 2:42:45.120]  Looks better than Fox News right there.
[2:42:45.120 --> 2:42:50.120]  We'll come back with him on other DOJ news with the CIA spying on Trump
[2:42:50.120 --> 2:42:52.120]  and more, total vindication for Judge Knapp.
[2:42:52.120 --> 2:43:21.120]  Stay with us.
[2:43:22.120 --> 2:43:48.120]  We'll see you next time.
[2:43:52.120 --> 2:44:02.120]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement
[2:44:02.120 --> 2:44:05.120]  that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:44:05.120 --> 2:44:10.120]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today,
[2:44:10.120 --> 2:44:13.120]  though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands
[2:44:13.120 --> 2:44:16.120]  for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[2:44:16.120 --> 2:44:21.120]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa
[2:44:21.120 --> 2:44:25.120]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[2:44:25.120 --> 2:44:30.120]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies
[2:44:30.120 --> 2:44:31.120]  to loosen up a little.
[2:44:31.120 --> 2:44:36.120]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[2:44:36.120 --> 2:44:42.120]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava
[2:44:42.120 --> 2:44:46.120]  but other herbs including, but not limited to, German Kama Mill,
[2:44:46.120 --> 2:44:49.120]  organic Skolkapp and Balarian root.
[2:44:49.120 --> 2:44:52.120]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly,
[2:44:52.120 --> 2:45:21.120]  so be sure to secure yours
[2:45:21.120 --> 2:45:50.120]  with Kava Kava.
[2:45:51.120 --> 2:45:56.120]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the world today,
[2:45:56.120 --> 2:45:59.120]  and it has been used for hundreds of years.
[2:45:59.120 --> 2:46:05.120]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava
[2:46:05.120 --> 2:46:11.120]  but other herbs including Kava Kava and Balarian root.
[2:46:11.120 --> 2:46:21.120]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava
[2:46:21.120 --> 2:46:31.120]  but other herbs including Kava Kava and Balarian root.
[2:46:31.120 --> 2:46:41.120]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava
[2:46:41.120 --> 2:46:58.120]  but other herbs including Kava Kava and Balarian root.
[2:46:58.120 --> 2:47:03.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[2:47:03.120 --> 2:47:08.120]  it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:30.120]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava
[2:47:30.120 --> 2:47:56.120]  but other herbs including Kava Kava and Balarian root.
[2:47:56.120 --> 2:48:13.120]  Alex, and thank you very much for your kind words about me.
[2:48:13.120 --> 2:48:15.120]  It's always a pleasure to be with you.
[2:48:15.120 --> 2:48:21.120]  The government rarely investigates itself, and the government hates investigating itself.
[2:48:21.120 --> 2:48:29.120]  And I originally was not in favor of this, a special prosecutor, not answerable to anybody,
[2:48:29.120 --> 2:48:36.120]  sort of a rogue person in the DOJ, much like Bob Mueller was in the Trump DOJ.
[2:48:36.120 --> 2:48:41.120]  But John Durham, just on the snippets of information, I must assume there's more,
[2:48:41.120 --> 2:48:47.120]  that he's revealed to a federal judge in D.C. involving this lawyer for Hillary Clinton
[2:48:47.120 --> 2:48:53.120]  who went in to speak to the general counsel of the FBI in order to dupe the FBI.
[2:48:53.120 --> 2:48:59.120]  John Durham has shown his cards and has shown some really bad things were going on.
[2:48:59.120 --> 2:49:01.120]  Here's what he has shown.
[2:49:01.120 --> 2:49:05.120]  And again, he's going to have to prove this to a jury.
[2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:08.120]  But he has made a prima facie case.
[2:49:08.120 --> 2:49:13.120]  He's laid out a case strong enough to know so that we know there's something there.
[2:49:13.120 --> 2:49:21.120]  Hillary Clinton's people attempted to put the FBI onto Donald Trump by duping the FBI
[2:49:21.120 --> 2:49:27.120]  into believing that there was a real Trump-Russia connection.
[2:49:27.120 --> 2:49:35.120]  This was not something done just by one lawyer who decided it was time for Trump to have a bad day.
[2:49:35.120 --> 2:49:39.120]  This was planned and plotted and orchestrated at the highest levels of the campaign.
[2:49:39.120 --> 2:49:43.120]  There's no evidence of Hillary's fingerprints on it, but knowing her personality,
[2:49:43.120 --> 2:49:51.120]  knowing her being a control type person, it's hard to believe that she did not know about this.
[2:49:51.120 --> 2:49:59.120]  The CIA was apparently monitoring the Trump campaign.
[2:49:59.120 --> 2:50:01.120]  Now, that's good and bad.
[2:50:01.120 --> 2:50:05.120]  It's good because the CIA is saying, we saw this stuff and we knew it was garbage.
[2:50:05.120 --> 2:50:09.120]  It's bad because they should have told the FBI that it was garbage.
[2:50:09.120 --> 2:50:17.120]  They should have spared Trump when he went through for the first two, two and a half years of his presidency.
[2:50:17.120 --> 2:50:20.120]  But they're all part of the deep state.
[2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:22.120]  There are some good FBI agents.
[2:50:22.120 --> 2:50:24.120]  We talked about that about 45 minutes ago.
[2:50:24.120 --> 2:50:26.120]  There are some good CIA agents.
[2:50:26.120 --> 2:50:27.120]  Guess what they do?
[2:50:27.120 --> 2:50:33.120]  They usually quit, like Phil Geraldi, when they realize what the CIA is up to.
[2:50:33.120 --> 2:50:41.120]  But if the CIA knew that what Hillary Clinton's people gave to the FBI was garbage and did nothing about it,
[2:50:41.120 --> 2:50:45.120]  that's because of the old boy rivalry between the CIA and the FBI.
[2:50:45.120 --> 2:50:46.120]  And it's bad.
[2:50:46.120 --> 2:50:52.120]  And the president of the United States suffered because of it and the American people suffered because of it.
[2:50:52.120 --> 2:50:58.120]  I think a lot of this will come out unless this fellow Sussman, the lawyer for Hillary,
[2:50:58.120 --> 2:51:03.120]  who's been indicted for lying to the FBI.
[2:51:03.120 --> 2:51:06.120]  Unless this fellow Sussman accepts a guilty plea.
[2:51:06.120 --> 2:51:09.120]  If there is a trial, right now the trial is scheduled for next month.
[2:51:09.120 --> 2:51:11.120]  It's scheduled, I think, for the second week in May.
[2:51:11.120 --> 2:51:14.120]  And again, judge, people that aren't a lawyer, a judge, like you explained,
[2:51:14.120 --> 2:51:17.120]  this is an ongoing criminal investigation.
[2:51:17.120 --> 2:51:20.120]  You have this lawyer for Hillary caught making up dossiers.
[2:51:20.120 --> 2:51:28.120]  Now, the other dossiers, they're saying the Justice Department matched that it was made basically on the same computer or user-generated,
[2:51:28.120 --> 2:51:31.120]  knowing that they have codes that show when and where it was made.
[2:51:31.120 --> 2:51:34.120]  So it's another fake document, that's what they're saying.
[2:51:34.120 --> 2:51:36.120]  It's another fake document.
[2:51:36.120 --> 2:51:40.120]  Now, when did the CIA know this was fake?
[2:51:40.120 --> 2:51:44.120]  Why didn't the FBI know this was fake?
[2:51:44.120 --> 2:51:52.120]  The whole Mueller investigation and tormenting of Donald Trump have been based on fake documents,
[2:51:52.120 --> 2:51:55.120]  and no experts along the line knew it.
[2:51:55.120 --> 2:51:59.120]  When did the CIA tell John Durham that these documents were fake?
[2:51:59.120 --> 2:52:04.120]  Back when Durham was appointed, when Trump was still in the White House, or just recently?
[2:52:04.120 --> 2:52:08.120]  So the CIA's hands might not be clean on this.
[2:52:08.120 --> 2:52:11.120]  I am suspect of anything coming from the CIA.
[2:52:11.120 --> 2:52:17.120]  But we now know that half the government said, this is garbage, and half the government was willing to use it.
[2:52:17.120 --> 2:52:21.120]  All of this will come out of this fellow's assessment goes to trial.
[2:52:21.120 --> 2:52:23.120]  But obviously, Trump wasn't a Russian agent.
[2:52:23.120 --> 2:52:28.120]  All of us got called Russian agents that weren't for what the Democrats were doing,
[2:52:28.120 --> 2:52:33.120]  and it was a great plan of Hillary, because they were sold out to the Chinese, the Russians, you name it.
[2:52:33.120 --> 2:52:40.120]  Hillary's like a NASCAR. She's got all the different sponsors on her, and we don't have any sponsors, which is fine with me.
[2:52:40.120 --> 2:52:48.120]  I couldn't imagine taking foreign money, but the idea that patriots like Trump or our eye or others are taking money is just preposterous.
[2:52:48.120 --> 2:52:51.120]  It's just crazy.
[2:52:51.120 --> 2:52:53.120]  Well, you're right.
[2:52:53.120 --> 2:52:57.120]  But what upsets me is what did the government know, and when did it know it?
[2:52:57.120 --> 2:53:00.120]  The same question that I asked about January 6th.
[2:53:00.120 --> 2:53:12.120]  The same question that I asked about the Michigan Wolverines, that's the militia of whose members were acquitted in the so-called government plot to kidnap Governor Wittner.
[2:53:12.120 --> 2:53:15.120]  The government shouldn't be doing this stuff.
[2:53:15.120 --> 2:53:19.120]  The government shouldn't be creating crimes.
[2:53:19.120 --> 2:53:22.120]  The government shouldn't be entrapping people.
[2:53:22.120 --> 2:53:27.120]  The government shouldn't be using bad data to investigate presidents.
[2:53:27.120 --> 2:53:33.120]  Aren't there enough crimes, all the human smuggling, open borders, drug cartels?
[2:53:33.120 --> 2:53:37.120]  Everybody I know has been robbed last year in Austin.
[2:53:37.120 --> 2:53:40.120]  Don't they have real stuff to deal with?
[2:53:40.120 --> 2:53:43.120]  Meanwhile, the Democrats want to defund the police.
[2:53:43.120 --> 2:53:45.120]  All right, you would think that they do.
[2:53:45.120 --> 2:53:47.120]  But again, we talked about this earlier.
[2:53:47.120 --> 2:53:56.120]  The government loves to create a crime and swoop in and solve the crime and take credit for keeping the public safe.
[2:53:56.120 --> 2:54:06.120]  At least a half dozen of the so-called plots, this is during the Bush war on terror after 9-11, to bomb the New York City subways.
[2:54:06.120 --> 2:54:09.120]  The whole thing was created by the FBI.
[2:54:09.120 --> 2:54:12.120]  There was no explosive material.
[2:54:12.120 --> 2:54:19.120]  They found some lone wolf who was disillusioned and talked him into how he could become a hero, led him to believe he was about to pull the trigger.
[2:54:19.120 --> 2:54:25.120]  And five minutes before he pulled the trigger, they all swooped into arrest him, and we're supposed to believe that we were safe.
[2:54:25.120 --> 2:54:29.120]  How don't we tell the FBI the heroes have stopped fentanyl, Judge?
[2:54:29.120 --> 2:54:31.120]  Wouldn't it be great if they stopped fentanyl?
[2:54:31.120 --> 2:54:33.120]  Yes, it would be.
[2:54:33.120 --> 2:54:38.120]  They would rather create a crime, make up a crime, and claim the credit for solving it.
[2:54:38.120 --> 2:54:41.120]  And you have innocent people in jail as a result of it.
[2:54:41.120 --> 2:54:47.120]  Innocent people who caused no harm serving 20-year sentences in jail.
[2:54:47.120 --> 2:54:49.120]  Well, what about January 6?
[2:54:49.120 --> 2:54:53.120]  I mean, sure, you beat a cop up a couple years in prison to crap on Bilozzi's desk.
[2:54:53.120 --> 2:54:56.120]  I give you a medal. No, no, shouldn't do that a month in prison.
[2:54:56.120 --> 2:55:00.120]  What do you make in the closing of the January 6 persecutions?
[2:55:00.120 --> 2:55:05.120]  I've seen you speak to it on your own show. I mean, this is a dangerous precedent.
[2:55:05.120 --> 2:55:13.120]  Well, what they're doing to these people who have been arrested is an American gulag.
[2:55:13.120 --> 2:55:22.120]  They are held in horrible conditions without bail or crimes to which the maximum, in many cases, doesn't exceed a year.
[2:55:22.120 --> 2:55:25.120]  In most cases, doesn't exceed three years.
[2:55:25.120 --> 2:55:28.120]  These people are not dangerous. They're not a danger to society.
[2:55:28.120 --> 2:55:31.120]  And they're not a danger of absconding.
[2:55:31.120 --> 2:55:36.120]  But they're being treated as if they are in Guantanamo Bay.
[2:55:36.120 --> 2:55:40.120]  In fact, I hate to say this, but it might be true that people in Guantanamo Bay
[2:55:40.120 --> 2:55:44.120]  have better living conditions in their jail confinement than these people do.
[2:55:44.120 --> 2:55:47.120]  And these people have not been convicted.
[2:55:47.120 --> 2:55:49.120]  Some of them haven't even been charged.
[2:55:49.120 --> 2:55:53.120]  And the DOJ is arguing that they're not entitled to bail.
[2:55:53.120 --> 2:55:56.120]  I'm going to have to write a piece called Merrick Garland and the Constitution,
[2:55:56.120 --> 2:56:05.120]  because his DOJ is beating the crap out of the Constitution in the manner in which it is treating these people who were arrested.
[2:56:05.120 --> 2:56:08.120]  Judge, let me ask you that in the one and a half minutes we have left.
[2:56:08.120 --> 2:56:16.120]  It seems like Democrats with 204 days out from the midterms are betting everything on January 6, claiming big terror attacks are coming,
[2:56:16.120 --> 2:56:21.120]  and all this hysteria. What do you make of this? Are they planning something?
[2:56:21.120 --> 2:56:24.120]  Voters aren't buying it. What do you think of that?
[2:56:24.120 --> 2:56:28.120]  Betting their whole reelection campaign on January 6?
[2:56:28.120 --> 2:56:31.120]  I know they have nothing else to base it on.
[2:56:31.120 --> 2:56:35.120]  Biden's popularity ratings are down at 33%.
[2:56:35.120 --> 2:56:37.120]  He could never be reelected with that.
[2:56:37.120 --> 2:56:42.120]  They're planning on hearings. They're trying to pick their best most sympathetic witnesses,
[2:56:42.120 --> 2:56:45.120]  and they're hoping that everybody will watch it.
[2:56:45.120 --> 2:56:48.120]  And I put in a little plug for judging freedom.
[2:56:48.120 --> 2:56:51.120]  Please, I love your show. I watch it every week.
[2:56:51.120 --> 2:56:58.120]  Tomorrow, Tuesday, April 19th at 12.45 in the afternoon eastern.
[2:56:58.120 --> 2:57:00.120]  Now I know that competes with you.
[2:57:00.120 --> 2:57:02.120]  I don't care. We love you. What's going on?
[2:57:02.120 --> 2:57:04.120]  Ron Paul.
[2:57:04.120 --> 2:57:11.120]  Ron Paul on judging freedom, unlimited for an hour, just he and me, the Thomas Jefferson of our era.
[2:57:11.120 --> 2:57:12.120]  I can't wait.
[2:57:12.120 --> 2:57:17.120]  Yeah, I'll probably just dial in and take the feed myself and tell Ron Paul I said hi.
[2:57:17.120 --> 2:57:21.120]  All right, tomorrow. Where do people find that? It's judging app.com.
[2:57:21.120 --> 2:57:23.120]  Judging freedom on YouTube.
[2:57:23.120 --> 2:57:30.120]  The last time I did something like this, you brought me thousands of subscribers in one afternoon.
[2:57:30.120 --> 2:57:31.120]  Alex, I can't thank you.
[2:57:31.120 --> 2:57:33.120]  Judge Nap, I'll come back. We love you. Thank you so much.
[2:57:33.120 --> 2:57:35.120]  Say hi to Ron Paul for me.
[2:57:35.120 --> 2:57:37.120]  All the best. Thanks for having me, Alex.
[2:57:37.120 --> 2:57:39.120]  Thank you. Your HD video is amazing.
[2:57:39.120 --> 2:57:43.120]  You're right back. Got some final news to cover than a guest. Stay with us.
[2:58:09.120 --> 2:58:11.120]  That's our oldest design and we still sell it.
[2:58:11.120 --> 2:58:18.120]  We have that design over a hundred others that will now all be limited editions because whatever stock we've got in, that's it.
[2:58:18.120 --> 2:58:23.120]  We're selling everything out to find the operation to get rid of inventory.
[2:58:23.120 --> 2:58:27.120]  We'll still have some teachers in the future. They'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[2:58:27.120 --> 2:58:30.120]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance.
[2:58:30.120 --> 2:58:35.120]  I almost forgot we're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[2:58:35.120 --> 2:58:43.120]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts, designer shirts, they're all selling at cost.
[2:58:43.120 --> 2:58:46.120]  infowarstore.com
[2:58:46.120 --> 2:58:55.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history.
[2:58:55.120 --> 2:59:02.120]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains are broken down,
[2:59:02.120 --> 2:59:07.120]  and info wars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for operations.
[2:59:07.120 --> 2:59:12.120]  And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making their main move.
[2:59:12.120 --> 2:59:16.120]  Info wars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever.
[2:59:16.120 --> 2:59:19.120]  It's reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
[2:59:19.120 --> 2:59:24.120]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else,
[2:59:24.120 --> 2:59:26.120]  we are running out of money.
[2:59:26.120 --> 2:59:35.120]  So listen, up to 75% off at infowarstore.com on things like amazing patriot t-shirts that help spread the word and fund the operation.
[2:59:35.120 --> 2:59:41.120]  On supplements, on books, on films, everything is 25 to 75% off right now.
[2:59:41.120 --> 2:59:44.120]  The biggest sell in our history at infowarstore.com.
[2:59:44.120 --> 2:59:57.120]  Thank you for your support.
[3:00:14.120 --> 3:00:29.120]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday, April 18th transmission.
[3:00:29.120 --> 3:00:50.120]  Charles Salintate is always extremely, he's about to take over here in just a moment and I just want to be absolutely clear with all the viewers and all the listeners about this thing here that really will touch every single one of us for a very, very long time.
[3:00:50.120 --> 3:00:56.120]  I've been on there 28 years and in that time we've changed the world together.
[3:00:56.120 --> 3:01:06.120]  And I know that there becomes kind of a subconscious understanding that info wars will always be here.
[3:01:06.120 --> 3:01:16.120]  And that Alex Jones will always be there and all the great guests and all the great callers and the great breaking news and the rebellion against tyranny will always be there.
[3:01:16.120 --> 3:01:19.120]  Until it's not always there.
[3:01:19.120 --> 3:01:28.120]  I remember loving my grandparents thinking they never be gone and they died one after the other and you're at their funeral, they're being lowered down on that ground.
[3:01:28.120 --> 3:01:35.120]  And so I tell you now that it's your decision whether or not you want us to continue on.
[3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:48.120]  It's your decision whether or not you want this organization to continue because yeah, we've declared restructuring bankruptcy because I'm maxed out and the corporate media claims I've got all this money.
[3:01:48.120 --> 3:02:00.120]  I want federal trustees to come in and check our books and see that's not true because I want to be able to restructure and continue our organization.
[3:02:00.120 --> 3:02:11.120]  But the people attacking us admit they don't want us on air and they want to silence our speech because they want to silence you.
[3:02:11.120 --> 3:02:20.120]  So again, you may never have another chance to get a t-shirt or get a book or get a film or get some great supplements that are amazing.
[3:02:20.120 --> 3:02:23.120]  But you can get right now at infowarstore.com.
[3:02:23.120 --> 3:02:32.120]  I need to build our war chest because money is the main thing that allows us to fight on your prayer, your word of mouth and your money.
[3:02:32.120 --> 3:02:36.120]  Your word of mouth gets new people awake and overrides the censorship and it's critical.
[3:02:36.120 --> 3:02:45.120]  The prayer is critical because you're will and you're reaching out to God and then the finances is the final part.
[3:02:45.120 --> 3:02:52.120]  I'm a fighter. I don't want to give up and I'm asking you don't let me give up.
[3:02:52.120 --> 3:02:55.120]  Don't let me give up. Please keep me in the fight.
[3:02:55.120 --> 3:02:57.120]  Please support us today.
[3:02:57.120 --> 3:03:05.120]  Please realize that if you're watching this and you've procrastinated and you haven't supported the broadcast that you're missing out on history right now
[3:03:05.120 --> 3:03:10.120]  and you're really letting some very evil, wicked, sick people take control.
[3:03:10.120 --> 3:03:12.120]  So this is do or die folks.
[3:03:12.120 --> 3:03:15.120]  I know the world's full of thousands of shows and entertainment.
[3:03:15.120 --> 3:03:21.120]  It's a background noise and people just get used to it and think, you know, oh yeah, right.
[3:03:21.120 --> 3:03:24.120]  But who has exposed the new world order?
[3:03:24.120 --> 3:03:26.120]  Who has exposed their operations?
[3:03:26.120 --> 3:03:30.120]  Who has helped get leaders elected worldwide that have changed the world?
[3:03:30.120 --> 3:03:31.120]  We have.
[3:03:31.120 --> 3:03:33.120]  You and I together.
[3:03:33.120 --> 3:03:41.120]  So now we're at that critical juncture in the coming months where if I have the funds, I can continue on.
[3:03:41.120 --> 3:03:46.120]  If I don't, I've got to make decisions that will keep us on air six months to a year.
[3:03:46.120 --> 3:03:53.120]  But then after that, there's no rebuilding something this big, this amazing, this historical.
[3:03:53.120 --> 3:03:57.120]  So I need you to reach down deep inside yourself and just say, am I passive?
[3:03:57.120 --> 3:04:04.120]  And I'm going to lay down to this or am I going to take this serious when all I'm doing is straight shooting you on my children, on my soul?
[3:04:04.120 --> 3:04:05.120]  God's witness.
[3:04:05.120 --> 3:04:07.120]  Strike me down if I'm lying.
[3:04:07.120 --> 3:04:14.120]  I don't have $16 million or $10 million or $5 million or $3 million of cash.
[3:04:14.120 --> 3:04:18.120]  I got two and a half million or less and that's nothing to run this operation.

[3:06:26.120 --> 3:06:31.120]  And you have Ramadan and Passover.
[3:06:31.120 --> 3:06:35.120]  All these holidays and nobody talks about peace.
[3:06:35.120 --> 3:06:41.120]  Anyway, you know, I was just listening to Alex and what's going on.
[3:06:41.120 --> 3:06:45.120]  And he's so right.
[3:06:45.120 --> 3:06:51.120]  You people better start, you know, I got to tell you, I'm getting really tired of it.
[3:06:51.120 --> 3:06:55.120]  We put out a magazine $2 a week, we give 185 pages.
[3:06:55.120 --> 3:06:58.120]  No magazine in the world comes close to it.
[3:06:58.120 --> 3:07:12.120]  We should have, you know, at least a couple of million subscribers and far beyond a low life piece of scum crap like like the New York Times, the paper of record.
[3:07:12.120 --> 3:07:14.120]  They call themselves a paper record.
[3:07:14.120 --> 3:07:16.120]  It's a turlet paper record.
[3:07:16.120 --> 3:07:22.120]  It's only good to wipe a lot of crap out that comes out of their mouths.
[3:07:22.120 --> 3:07:25.120]  So don't tune into info wars.
[3:07:25.120 --> 3:07:28.120]  Watch the cartoon news network.
[3:07:28.120 --> 3:07:29.120]  Yeah, watch.
[3:07:29.120 --> 3:07:30.120]  What's his name?
[3:07:30.120 --> 3:07:39.120]  Anderson Cooper, little daddy's girl or I forgot a mommy's girl, Gloria Vanderbilt's baby.
[3:07:39.120 --> 3:07:43.120]  This guy be anywhere if mommy wasn't Gloria Vanderbilt.
[3:07:43.120 --> 3:07:45.120]  He had fat mouth Cuomo.
[3:07:45.120 --> 3:07:49.120]  You think you would have been any way if daddy wasn't Mario Cuomo.
[3:07:49.120 --> 3:07:55.120]  What the people info wars are doing is you know what they're doing.
[3:07:55.120 --> 3:08:04.120]  They're fighting for everything that they have to do the best they can to expose this crap.
[3:08:04.120 --> 3:08:12.120]  This crap that they're shoving down our throats and expect us to swallow.
[3:08:12.120 --> 3:08:17.120]  And banning everybody that won't swallow the garbage.
[3:08:17.120 --> 3:08:20.120]  Puking out of that Fauci's mouth.
[3:08:20.120 --> 3:08:23.120]  Oh, how dare you, Celenti?
[3:08:23.120 --> 3:08:33.120]  He's one of the most highest paid public officials pieces of scum in the United States.
[3:08:33.120 --> 3:08:43.120]  And if you say anything bad about him, I'm that little peach eye guy over in Google.
[3:08:43.120 --> 3:08:45.120]  And I'll shut you down.
[3:08:45.120 --> 3:08:51.120]  I got a pair of Cajones much smaller than a mop ball.
[3:08:51.120 --> 3:08:53.120]  I'm on the who am I?
[3:08:53.120 --> 3:08:54.120]  Oh, I'm cook.
[3:08:54.120 --> 3:08:55.120]  I'm cook.
[3:08:55.120 --> 3:08:58.120]  Oh, you're my cook to death, man.
[3:08:58.120 --> 3:08:59.120]  Cooked out.
[3:08:59.120 --> 3:09:00.120]  Cooked to nothing.
[3:09:00.120 --> 3:09:04.120]  Telling us what we can do.
[3:09:04.120 --> 3:09:06.120]  Apple.
[3:09:06.120 --> 3:09:08.120]  One after another.
[3:09:08.120 --> 3:09:10.120]  You're censored.
[3:09:10.120 --> 3:09:14.120]  Google, Facebook, Zuckerberg.
[3:09:14.120 --> 3:09:17.120]  You look at that little freak.
[3:09:17.120 --> 3:09:21.120]  Oh, I'll tell you what to say, Celenti.
[3:09:21.120 --> 3:09:24.120]  Don't you know who I am?
[3:09:24.120 --> 3:09:29.120]  I went to Harvard.
[3:09:29.120 --> 3:09:30.120]  Twitter.
[3:09:30.120 --> 3:09:31.120]  Dorsi.
[3:09:31.120 --> 3:09:32.120]  Look at this guy.
[3:09:32.120 --> 3:09:35.120]  Look at the little guts zone.
[3:09:35.120 --> 3:09:39.120]  Look at the arrogant little guts zone telling us what to do.
[3:09:39.120 --> 3:09:42.120]  You better get empty your damn pockets.
[3:09:42.120 --> 3:09:45.120]  We're in the fight for death.
[3:09:45.120 --> 3:09:47.120]  Do what you can to support it for worse.
[3:09:47.120 --> 3:09:55.120]  If they're going through this crap like this is total nonsense.
[3:09:55.120 --> 3:09:58.120]  Oh, you don't like what Alex Jones said?
[3:09:58.120 --> 3:10:05.120]  How about bringing George Bush to trial for lying us into the Iraq war?
[3:10:05.120 --> 3:10:10.120]  You think that's a little worse than the lawsuit that Alex is going through?
[3:10:10.120 --> 3:10:14.120]  He only murdered about 850,000 people.
[3:10:14.120 --> 3:10:20.120]  And how come those damn Russians were in sending weapons to Iraq?
[3:10:20.120 --> 3:10:22.120]  Look at that little clown.
[3:10:22.120 --> 3:10:24.120]  Another daddy's boy.
[3:10:24.120 --> 3:10:26.120]  A little coward of a freak.
[3:10:26.120 --> 3:10:34.120]  Would be nobody if daddy was in Georgie senior and grandpa was in Prescott.
[3:10:34.120 --> 3:10:38.120]  How come he's not brought up on charges?
[3:10:38.120 --> 3:10:44.120]  I think the war crimes are a lot worse than what Alex pulled off.
[3:10:44.120 --> 3:10:46.120]  Lying us into war?
[3:10:46.120 --> 3:10:48.120]  Hey, we were those Chinese.
[3:10:48.120 --> 3:10:55.120]  How come you weren't sending weapons to Iraq like America's sending weapons to Ukraine?
[3:10:55.120 --> 3:11:02.120]  Oh, it's okay for America to send weapons to Ukraine that a country that Russia is fighting.
[3:11:02.120 --> 3:11:08.120]  But it would never be okay for Russia to send weapons to a country America is fighting.
[3:11:08.120 --> 3:11:11.120]  Oh, those dirty Russians.
[3:11:11.120 --> 3:11:13.120]  Well, you're getting on info wars.
[3:11:13.120 --> 3:11:15.120]  You're not getting on any other media stream.
[3:11:15.120 --> 3:11:19.120]  Nothing comes close to it.
[3:11:19.120 --> 3:11:26.120]  Send what you can and don't be so damn cheap.
[3:11:26.120 --> 3:11:30.120]  Unless you want to go to hell because that's where we're leading us.
[3:11:30.120 --> 3:11:34.120]  If we don't unite and fight for peace.
[3:11:34.120 --> 3:11:38.120]  Little pieces of crap telling us what to do.
[3:11:38.120 --> 3:11:40.120]  Nobody talking about peace.
[3:11:40.120 --> 3:11:43.120]  Nobody bringing out the information that you're getting on info wars.
[3:11:43.120 --> 3:11:47.120]  Or we give you with the magazine, the trends journal.
[3:11:47.120 --> 3:11:49.120]  I'm tired of this crap, man.
[3:11:49.120 --> 3:11:54.120]  A bunch of gutless little people and how low this country is gone, man.
[3:11:54.120 --> 3:11:56.120]  The way people dress.
[3:11:56.120 --> 3:11:59.120]  All their blue jeans all ripped with all over.
[3:11:59.120 --> 3:12:01.120]  Doesn't that look great or ripped?
[3:12:01.120 --> 3:12:03.120]  They're dungarees.
[3:12:03.120 --> 3:12:06.120]  They're shitty dungarees.
[3:12:06.120 --> 3:12:13.120]  That Levi Strauss used to make when they were doing all the gold mining in California in the 1850s.
[3:12:13.120 --> 3:12:16.120]  Oh, that was become the style.
[3:12:16.120 --> 3:12:18.120]  They say that pigs can't fly.
[3:12:18.120 --> 3:12:20.120]  You've been to the airport.
[3:12:20.120 --> 3:12:24.120]  It's a pig show.
[3:12:24.120 --> 3:12:28.120]  This country is going down.
[3:12:28.120 --> 3:12:31.120]  It's a garbage can.
[3:12:31.120 --> 3:12:35.120]  I went to the city yesterday to go visit my sister in a nursing home.
[3:12:35.120 --> 3:12:39.120]  Every road I took potholes everywhere.
[3:12:39.120 --> 3:12:45.120]  Oh, you got a riverdale, one of the richest places in New York City, the whole area.
[3:12:45.120 --> 3:12:48.120]  You got holes, bumps like you would not believe.
[3:12:48.120 --> 3:12:54.120]  Oh, but we're going to send 20 trillion billion dollars to Ukraine.
[3:12:54.120 --> 3:12:55.120]  Look at it.
[3:12:55.120 --> 3:12:56.120]  Let's New York.
[3:12:56.120 --> 3:12:58.120]  Look at a garbage can.
[3:12:58.120 --> 3:13:01.120]  A garbage can.
[3:13:01.120 --> 3:13:07.120]  This country is going down so hard, so fast, and you got a bunch of gutless people,
[3:13:07.120 --> 3:13:12.120]  but not the people watching in forwards.
[3:13:12.120 --> 3:13:16.120]  So put your money where your heart is.
[3:13:16.120 --> 3:13:19.120]  Where's the Elon Musk's?
[3:13:19.120 --> 3:13:22.120]  Where are all these multimulti-millionaires?
[3:13:22.120 --> 3:13:26.120]  How come they're not putting up the big money?
[3:13:26.120 --> 3:13:31.120]  Where are they?
[3:13:31.120 --> 3:13:33.120]  Again, we're giving you everything.
[3:13:33.120 --> 3:13:36.120]  Look at that cover by Anthony Frieda.
[3:13:36.120 --> 3:13:37.120]  All right?
[3:13:37.120 --> 3:13:40.120]  China started COVID war.
[3:13:40.120 --> 3:13:43.120]  He'd been Shanghai'd.
[3:13:43.120 --> 3:13:45.120]  TrendsJournal.com.
[3:13:45.120 --> 3:13:48.120]  It's the only magazine where you're going to go.
[3:13:48.120 --> 3:13:51.120]  What in the world is going on?
[3:13:51.120 --> 3:13:52.120]  What's next?
[3:13:52.120 --> 3:13:53.120]  What it means?
[3:13:53.120 --> 3:13:54.120]  What to do?
[3:13:54.120 --> 3:13:56.120]  Now, you don't want to know about this.
[3:13:56.120 --> 3:13:57.120]  No, no.
[3:13:57.120 --> 3:13:59.120]  Pay three dollars to read the toilet paper.
[3:13:59.120 --> 3:14:02.120]  How about the Washington Post?
[3:14:02.120 --> 3:14:05.120]  Isn't that a nice bunch of bezos?
[3:14:05.120 --> 3:14:08.120]  Bullshit!
[3:14:08.120 --> 3:14:16.120]  No people for peace coming out of their fat mouths.
[3:14:16.120 --> 3:14:18.120]  You want a job in Amazon?
[3:14:18.120 --> 3:14:21.120]  Yeah, why don't you go to the jungle?
[3:14:21.120 --> 3:14:24.120]  That's all it is.
[3:14:24.120 --> 3:14:28.120]  A jungle.
[3:14:28.120 --> 3:14:30.120]  Let loose what you do.
[3:14:30.120 --> 3:14:31.120]  Stop the crap.
[3:14:31.120 --> 3:14:36.120]  Let's get this thing back on the road and get this energy going.
[3:14:36.120 --> 3:14:37.120]  And bail them out.
[3:14:37.120 --> 3:14:39.120]  We're talking chump change.
[3:14:39.120 --> 3:14:41.120]  All the people listened in for wars.
[3:14:41.120 --> 3:14:42.120]  Here, there he is.
[3:14:42.120 --> 3:14:44.120]  Now, there's a man for you, huh?
[3:14:44.120 --> 3:14:45.120]  Yeah.
[3:14:45.120 --> 3:14:47.120]  What planet?
[3:14:47.120 --> 3:14:52.120]  What planet is this guy from?
[3:14:52.120 --> 3:14:55.120]  I've had it, man.
[3:14:55.120 --> 3:14:58.120]  I'm in it for the fight.
[3:14:58.120 --> 3:15:02.120]  And I give it everything I have to do it.
[3:15:02.120 --> 3:15:05.120]  I'm not a young cat, you know?
[3:15:05.120 --> 3:15:11.120]  Where are all you men out there and women?
[3:15:11.120 --> 3:15:13.120]  Look, these guys are going through over there.
[3:15:13.120 --> 3:15:15.120]  For what?
[3:15:15.120 --> 3:15:16.120]  For what?
[3:15:16.120 --> 3:15:20.120]  Hey, how about Obama's war, the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner?
[3:15:20.120 --> 3:15:22.120]  That guy Assad has to go.
[3:15:22.120 --> 3:15:24.120]  Oh, that was Syria, Libya.
[3:15:24.120 --> 3:15:25.120]  That was Gaddafi in Libya.
[3:15:25.120 --> 3:15:28.120]  Oh, yeah.
[3:15:28.120 --> 3:15:30.120]  That's a criminal.
[3:15:30.120 --> 3:15:33.120]  That's the charges that should be put out.
[3:15:33.120 --> 3:15:37.120]  I didn't only worth about probably about $20 billion now.
[3:15:37.120 --> 3:15:42.120]  Yeah, Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner in a country near you.
[3:15:42.120 --> 3:15:44.120]  It's a freak show.
[3:15:44.120 --> 3:15:50.120]  You better be who you are before you die or go to hell.
[3:15:50.120 --> 3:16:04.120]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago were very public about their plans.
[3:16:04.120 --> 3:16:08.120]  They financed universities, they ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda of New York Times, other major newspapers.
[3:16:08.120 --> 3:16:12.120]  That the family, as we know it, is a bad thing and must be ended.
[3:16:12.120 --> 3:16:16.120]  And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching.
[3:16:16.120 --> 3:16:21.120]  Women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[3:16:21.120 --> 3:16:26.120]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four natural daughter.
[3:16:26.120 --> 3:16:28.120]  My wife makes dinner a lot of times.
[3:16:28.120 --> 3:16:29.120]  But I like to make it as well.
[3:16:29.120 --> 3:16:30.120]  I love to make breakfast.
[3:16:30.120 --> 3:16:35.120]  And literally, it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be nurturative.
[3:16:35.120 --> 3:16:39.120]  And then all sit down together and have the communal event.
[3:16:39.120 --> 3:16:45.120]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding, is our normal biological actions are coming together.
[3:16:45.120 --> 3:16:46.120]  They really are.
[3:16:46.120 --> 3:16:52.120]  Sick, evil, scientific cult of filth that will domesticate us and turn us into lab rats.
[3:16:52.120 --> 3:16:54.120]  We cannot let this continue.
[3:16:54.120 --> 3:16:56.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[3:16:56.120 --> 3:16:59.120]  I need your help keeping Info Wars on the air and strong.
[3:16:59.120 --> 3:17:03.120]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[3:17:03.120 --> 3:17:05.120]  I was born for this.
[3:17:05.120 --> 3:17:06.120]  You were born for this.
[3:17:06.120 --> 3:17:08.120]  And people are really waking up right now.
[3:17:08.120 --> 3:17:15.120]  But we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[3:17:15.120 --> 3:17:27.120]  And now, with Band-Aught Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge.
[3:17:27.120 --> 3:17:31.120]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[3:17:31.120 --> 3:17:38.120]  Info Wars and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide.
[3:17:38.120 --> 3:17:45.120]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[3:17:45.120 --> 3:17:48.120]  So, the biggest sale in Info Wars history is going right now.

[3:20:27.120 --> 3:20:32.120]  And now your host, Gerald Salente.
[3:20:32.120 --> 3:20:37.120]  Hey everyone, great being you on the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:37.120 --> 3:20:44.120]  As I said before, they got great products out there. Do what you can to support them, enough.
[3:20:44.120 --> 3:20:50.120]  Because if we lose InfoWars, we're losing a lot out of life.
[3:20:50.120 --> 3:20:53.120]  And they're just going to keep stealing it from us.
[3:20:53.120 --> 3:20:56.120]  Censorship, could you believe it?
[3:20:56.120 --> 3:21:12.120]  You can't say anything if it's not by the dictates of the bangsters, the drug dealers, the war machine, or big tech.
[3:21:12.120 --> 3:21:16.120]  Well, you know, I'm a trend forecast. I've been out this 42 years.
[3:21:16.120 --> 3:21:20.120]  I'll put my track record up against anybody in the world.
[3:21:20.120 --> 3:21:26.120]  Show me a book, show me a magazine, show me a trend forecast. Do I get it right all the time? Of course not.
[3:21:26.120 --> 3:21:36.120]  I'm a human being, unlike the pictures of some of these guys like the Zuckerbergs and the Bezos that looks like they're from another planet.
[3:21:36.120 --> 3:21:46.120]  But you show me your track record, then we can begin to talk about seeing how the future is playing out.
[3:21:46.120 --> 3:21:51.120]  World War III has begun.
[3:21:51.120 --> 3:22:01.120]  Could you imagine, could you imagine, you know, every time like I read about a forest fires, you know, in California, this one's in New Mexico.
[3:22:01.120 --> 3:22:05.120]  My heart breaks. My God, these people lost everything that they had.
[3:22:05.120 --> 3:22:16.120]  Can you imagine having to vacate your house if all of a sudden missiles started flying in from another country we're a war at?
[3:22:16.120 --> 3:22:19.120]  And you have to flee to another country?
[3:22:19.120 --> 3:22:26.120]  Can you imagine what that would feel like, leaving all your life's possessions behind?
[3:22:26.120 --> 3:22:31.120]  That's going to happen if we don't unite for peace.
[3:22:31.120 --> 3:22:41.120]  They asked Albert Einstein, a guy that knew a thing or two about wars and how the weapons of mass destruction to be used to guide them when inventors of the atom bomb.
[3:22:41.120 --> 3:22:44.120]  They asked him, what kind of weapons will be used to fight the Third World War?
[3:22:44.120 --> 3:22:50.120]  He said, I don't know, but they'll be using sticks and stones to fight the fourth.
[3:22:50.120 --> 3:22:55.120]  We are on the precipice of World War III. It's already begun.
[3:22:55.120 --> 3:23:24.120]  As I said, could you imagine if the Chinese were arming and the Russians were arming and sending missiles and tanks and anti-aircraft weapons and all of this other kind of missiles to Syria or to Libya, to Iraq, to Afghanistan?
[3:23:24.120 --> 3:23:46.120]  Can you imagine if the Chinese were sending more and more and more weapons in all the other countries that hated America into Iraq and Afghanistan as American troops go in there to kill innocent people on a war based on lies?
[3:23:46.120 --> 3:23:54.120]  They would hate the Chinese for that. Our brave soldiers are going over there and doing their duty to their young guys to swallow the crap.
[3:23:54.120 --> 3:23:58.120]  You don't know when you're a kid. You bleed a propaganda.
[3:23:58.120 --> 3:24:04.120]  I'm a Yankee doodle dandy. A Yankee doodle to what? Die.
[3:24:04.120 --> 3:24:06.120]  Yeah.
[3:24:06.120 --> 3:24:10.120]  Going to fight World War I for what? Another war based on lies.
[3:24:10.120 --> 3:24:18.120]  No, this, we were in the crisis of our lives. And if we don't unite on the one umbrella, it's finished, man.
[3:24:18.120 --> 3:24:20.120]  Oh, and women.
[3:24:20.120 --> 3:24:22.120]  And Lola.
[3:24:22.120 --> 3:24:26.120]  Anyway.
[3:24:26.120 --> 3:24:32.120]  Federal Judge in Florida on Monday vacated the Biden administration's national mass mandate.
[3:24:32.120 --> 3:24:40.120]  The, again, it's really stupid crap. Oh, we're going to keep it till May 30. Well, I say May 4th. Well, I'm Fauci. I say May 5th.
[3:24:40.120 --> 3:24:44.120]  I am. I'm another piece of garbage scum crap.
[3:24:44.120 --> 3:24:48.120]  We're going to, we're going to make it.
[3:24:48.120 --> 3:24:52.120]  Yes. May 8th.
[3:24:52.120 --> 3:24:55.120]  That's all it is. It's crap.
[3:24:55.120 --> 3:24:57.120]  They're making this stuff up.
[3:24:57.120 --> 3:25:02.120]  You could eat in an airplane and you could drink in an airplane.
[3:25:02.120 --> 3:25:05.120]  Oh, yeah, the billionaire over there.
[3:25:05.120 --> 3:25:06.120]  Yeah.
[3:25:06.120 --> 3:25:07.120]  Look at these guys.
[3:25:07.120 --> 3:25:09.120]  Yeah, our money.
[3:25:09.120 --> 3:25:15.120]  Our money going to a clown show. An arrogant, arrogant little boy.
[3:25:15.120 --> 3:25:19.120]  So they make this stuff up. You could eat and drink without a mask on in an airplane.
[3:25:19.120 --> 3:25:24.120]  But then you got to put it up after you eat and drink because the virus knows when you're not eating and drinking.
[3:25:24.120 --> 3:25:29.120]  I got to tell you, man, you know, I know there's busy places around. It's dead up here.
[3:25:29.120 --> 3:25:34.120]  It's dead zone everywhere I go in the whole area up here.
[3:25:34.120 --> 3:25:38.120]  And not the New York.
[3:25:38.120 --> 3:25:40.120]  Yep. There we go.
[3:25:40.120 --> 3:25:44.120]  Let's be stupid. Hey, remember these to make those little kids in school?
[3:25:44.120 --> 3:25:48.120]  It would go in little tents like plastic tents to play their instruments.
[3:25:48.120 --> 3:25:54.120]  Remember that? Oh, you remember how to put plastic shields up because the virus doesn't go around the shield.
[3:25:54.120 --> 3:25:57.120]  It has to be right there.
[3:25:57.120 --> 3:26:00.120]  Going back to what I was saying before World War.
[3:26:00.120 --> 3:26:01.120]  Yeah, that is.
[3:26:01.120 --> 3:26:14.120]  These are stupid people leading us ignorant jerks, arrogant ignorant jerks leading us, telling us what to do.
[3:26:14.120 --> 3:26:18.120]  Who's your favorite jerk?
[3:26:18.120 --> 3:26:21.120]  Look at look at the clown show.
[3:26:21.120 --> 3:26:24.120]  Oh, I hate Biden. Oh, but I love McConnell.
[3:26:24.120 --> 3:26:27.120]  Then see Graham's my kind of whatever.
[3:26:27.120 --> 3:26:30.120]  No, no, no, Ted Cruz. Yeah.
[3:26:30.120 --> 3:26:32.120]  How about take me on a sea cruise, man?
[3:26:32.120 --> 3:26:36.120]  Look at this guy. Look at this guy.
[3:26:36.120 --> 3:26:39.120]  Look at him one clown show after another telling us what to do.
[3:26:39.120 --> 3:26:44.120]  How could people take orders from these clowns?
[3:26:44.120 --> 3:26:47.120]  Speaking of which.
[3:26:47.120 --> 3:26:50.120]  There's another clown out there.
[3:26:50.120 --> 3:26:57.120]  Senator Chris Coons signals he favors sending troops to Ukraine.
[3:26:57.120 --> 3:27:00.120]  Senator Chris croons. What croons?
[3:27:00.120 --> 3:27:05.120]  Goon got some.
[3:27:05.120 --> 3:27:07.120]  Who the hell is this guy?
[3:27:07.120 --> 3:27:13.120]  He signal that he wants the U.S. to trend send troops to Ukraine to fight.
[3:27:13.120 --> 3:27:19.120]  Hey, a tough boy, put on your uniform and go lead the charge.
[3:27:19.120 --> 3:27:21.120]  That's right.
[3:27:21.120 --> 3:27:23.120]  You want to go fight go fight.
[3:27:23.120 --> 3:27:25.120]  Look at this little guy.
[3:27:25.120 --> 3:27:27.120]  Look at this little gutless little clown.
[3:27:27.120 --> 3:27:29.120]  Your little gutless clown.
[3:27:29.120 --> 3:27:32.120]  You arrogant little warmonger.
[3:27:32.120 --> 3:27:35.120]  You're not an American.
[3:27:35.120 --> 3:27:37.120]  You're a sellout.
[3:27:37.120 --> 3:27:38.120]  Look at his show.
[3:27:38.120 --> 3:27:43.120]  Look at his freaks.
[3:27:43.120 --> 3:27:45.120]  Coon was asked on CBS News Station,
[3:27:45.120 --> 3:27:47.120]  the nation he made last week,
[3:27:47.120 --> 3:27:49.120]  and addressed the University of Michigan.
[3:27:49.120 --> 3:27:52.120]  Coons said the Biden administration in Congress would quote,
[3:27:52.120 --> 3:27:58.120]  come to a common position about when we are willing to go to the next step
[3:27:58.120 --> 3:28:03.120]  and not just send arms but troops into the hunts of Ukraine.
[3:28:03.120 --> 3:28:08.120]  Hey, Cooney, go fight.
[3:28:08.120 --> 3:28:10.120]  Go fight.
[3:28:10.120 --> 3:28:11.120]  Guess what?
[3:28:11.120 --> 3:28:12.120]  Look at him.
[3:28:12.120 --> 3:28:14.120]  Look at that little cut zone.
[3:28:14.120 --> 3:28:17.120]  Look at that little cut zone with two others.
[3:28:17.120 --> 3:28:22.120]  Arrogant, arrogant clown show in front of your eyes.
[3:28:22.120 --> 3:28:27.120]  This jerk deciding for us what to do.
[3:28:27.120 --> 3:28:33.120]  Yep, the American people cannot turn away from this tragedy in Ukraine.
[3:28:33.120 --> 3:28:35.120]  Oh, they can't?
[3:28:35.120 --> 3:28:36.120]  I can.
[3:28:36.120 --> 3:28:37.120]  I'm an American.
[3:28:37.120 --> 3:28:38.120]  Ain't my business.
[3:28:38.120 --> 3:28:40.120]  Ain't my business.
[3:28:40.120 --> 3:28:43.120]  I'm an American believing people like George Washington,
[3:28:43.120 --> 3:28:47.120]  that low life pieces of garbage like you never would.
[3:28:47.120 --> 3:28:50.120]  And I can't say the other word because I don't want to get censored.

[3:31:55.120 --> 3:31:58.120]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand info wars.
[3:31:58.120 --> 3:32:04.120]  I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show.
[3:32:04.120 --> 3:32:05.120]  I wanted to hire camera people.
[3:32:05.120 --> 3:32:06.120]  I wanted to make films.
[3:32:06.120 --> 3:32:08.120]  I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[3:32:08.120 --> 3:32:11.120]  And it was a t-shirt I designed the first one.
[3:32:11.120 --> 3:32:17.120]  Mass murderers agreed gun control works that helped us finance hiring the first three members of my crew.
[3:32:17.120 --> 3:32:19.120]  That's our oldest design that we're still selling.
[3:32:19.120 --> 3:32:24.120]  We have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited editions.
[3:32:24.120 --> 3:32:26.120]  Because whatever stock we've got in, that's it.

[3:32:31.120 --> 3:32:33.120]  We'll still have some t-shirts in the future.

[3:33:32.120 --> 3:33:35.120]  And they're at infowarsstore.com.
[3:33:35.120 --> 3:33:41.120]  And they have great products that you can use, and not only to use for yourself to help yourself,
[3:33:41.120 --> 3:33:43.120]  but really to help Infowars.
[3:33:43.120 --> 3:33:46.120]  So we're at a critical time. Again, they're taking us to war.
[3:33:46.120 --> 3:33:47.120]  It's already started.
[3:33:47.120 --> 3:33:55.120]  I started telling you about that little jerky looking clown coons saying it's our duty to get involved in Ukraine.
[3:33:55.120 --> 3:33:57.120]  The American people cannot turn away from this tragedy.
[3:33:57.120 --> 3:34:02.120]  Who are you to tell me that?
[3:34:02.120 --> 3:34:08.120]  I think the history of the 21st century turns on how fiercely we defend freedom in Ukraine.
[3:34:08.120 --> 3:34:11.120]  And that Putin will only stop when we stop them.
[3:34:11.120 --> 3:34:16.120]  When we? What do you mean when we, Kimosabe?
[3:34:16.120 --> 3:34:20.120]  What do you mean we? Who are the we?
[3:34:20.120 --> 3:34:22.120]  Clown Boy Cones.
[3:34:22.120 --> 3:34:26.120]  Who are the we? Not you. You're no fighter.
[3:34:26.120 --> 3:34:32.120]  You're one of these little sick-minded freaks
[3:34:32.120 --> 3:34:39.120]  who have turned our Constitution and bill of rights into blasphemy.
[3:34:39.120 --> 3:34:43.120]  No foreign entanglements. A man George Washington.
[3:34:43.120 --> 3:34:47.120]  A real man that was president, not like these boys,
[3:34:47.120 --> 3:34:53.120]  like Draft Dodger Biden, who talks so tough but wouldn't go fight,
[3:34:53.120 --> 3:34:59.120]  or Trump talks tough but wouldn't go fight,
[3:34:59.120 --> 3:35:03.120]  or Obama, but he talks so proper, folks,
[3:35:03.120 --> 3:35:09.120]  who wouldn't go fight but love to kill, like Clinton,
[3:35:09.120 --> 3:35:13.120]  love to kill but didn't fight,
[3:35:13.120 --> 3:35:17.120]  like Johnson, who loved to kill and didn't fight,
[3:35:17.120 --> 3:35:22.120]  like Nixon, who loved to kill but didn't fight.
[3:35:22.120 --> 3:35:24.120]  Oh, Kennedy.
[3:35:24.120 --> 3:35:29.120]  Oh, he knew what it was to fight and didn't want to kill, but they killed him.
[3:35:29.120 --> 3:35:33.120]  Yup, Cuban Missile Crisis. Yeah, let's make a deal over here.
[3:35:33.120 --> 3:35:35.120]  We'll pull missiles out of Turkey.
[3:35:35.120 --> 3:35:37.120]  Russia, you pull them out of Cuba.
[3:35:37.120 --> 3:35:42.120]  Okay, we got a deal. But Jackie, you're dead.
[3:35:42.120 --> 3:35:44.120]  Eight months after they killed him,
[3:35:44.120 --> 3:35:48.120]  Lyndon Johnson took us to the Vietnam War.
[3:35:48.120 --> 3:35:52.120]  He was against that, too.
[3:35:52.120 --> 3:35:56.120]  No foreign entanglements. Ukraine is in our business.
[3:35:56.120 --> 3:35:59.120]  We're going on back and forth with Russia forever.
[3:35:59.120 --> 3:36:02.120]  Our country is rotted to nothing.
[3:36:02.120 --> 3:36:04.120]  It's going down big and hard.
[3:36:04.120 --> 3:36:07.120]  Again, look at what this country looks like.
[3:36:07.120 --> 3:36:09.120]  Yup.
[3:36:09.120 --> 3:36:12.120]  You know, by the way, I have a photograph.
[3:36:12.120 --> 3:36:14.120]  When I come back, I'll show it to you.
[3:36:14.120 --> 3:36:18.120]  Me and John Connolly, the guy that took the bullet in the back,
[3:36:18.120 --> 3:36:20.120]  sitting in front of Kennedy.
[3:36:20.120 --> 3:36:23.120]  He wanted to meet me back in 1992.
[3:36:23.120 --> 3:36:27.120]  I have a picture of me, him, and his wife from the Book Depository.
[3:36:27.120 --> 3:36:30.120]  Anyway, we're walking back into the Book Depository.
[3:36:30.120 --> 3:36:33.120]  We're walking back into the Anatole Hotel.
[3:36:33.120 --> 3:36:35.120]  In the lobby, he looked at me.
[3:36:35.120 --> 3:36:38.120]  He said, you know, I read you a book, trend tracking. Find peace of work.
[3:36:38.120 --> 3:36:40.120]  And I know your heart's in the right place.
[3:36:40.120 --> 3:36:42.120]  But you don't have a clue what's going on.
[3:36:42.120 --> 3:36:44.120]  And neither do the American people.
[3:36:44.120 --> 3:36:48.120]  Because if they did, there'd be a revolution in this country.
[3:36:48.120 --> 3:36:51.120]  This was the guy that was a Democratic governor
[3:36:51.120 --> 3:36:53.120]  who took the bullet in the back,
[3:36:53.120 --> 3:36:55.120]  sitting in front of Kennedy.
[3:36:55.120 --> 3:37:00.120]  And he was also the Treasury Secretary
[3:37:00.120 --> 3:37:02.120]  under Richard Nixon, a Republican,
[3:37:02.120 --> 3:37:05.120]  that took us off the gold standard.
[3:37:05.120 --> 3:37:09.120]  We're in the fight for our lives.
[3:37:09.120 --> 3:37:13.120]  I was reading that Coongoon article.
[3:37:13.120 --> 3:37:15.120]  Over the weekend, The Times reported
[3:37:15.120 --> 3:37:19.120]  that British Special Air Forces soldiers
[3:37:19.120 --> 3:37:24.120]  deployed to Ukraine to train Ukrainian forces
[3:37:24.120 --> 3:37:29.120]  on anti-tank weapons provided by London.
[3:37:29.120 --> 3:37:31.120]  Oh, yeah, they're just going there to train.
[3:37:31.120 --> 3:37:33.120]  They're not going there to fight.
[3:37:33.120 --> 3:37:38.120]  Can you imagine if Russia sent troops into Iraq
[3:37:38.120 --> 3:37:43.120]  and into Libya and into Afghanistan
[3:37:43.120 --> 3:37:46.120]  and China to fight the Americans?
[3:37:46.120 --> 3:37:50.120]  To illegally invading these foreign countries.
[3:37:50.120 --> 3:37:55.120]  And now these officials, official pieces of garbage,
[3:37:55.120 --> 3:37:58.120]  are telling us what to do and how to do it
[3:37:58.120 --> 3:38:02.120]  when you haven't won a war since.
[3:38:02.120 --> 3:38:05.120]  Missile strikes hit Ukraine's Key Western city,
[3:38:05.120 --> 3:38:13.120]  the Lviv, roughly 40 miles from Polish border.
[3:38:13.120 --> 3:38:16.120]  The besieged Eastern city of Maripole
[3:38:16.120 --> 3:38:18.120]  is holding out amid fierce fighting
[3:38:18.120 --> 3:38:21.120]  between Russian and Ukraine forces,
[3:38:21.120 --> 3:38:24.120]  despite heavy human toll.
[3:38:24.120 --> 3:38:28.120]  Maripole has refused Russia's demand to surrender
[3:38:28.120 --> 3:38:31.120]  with Ukrainian forces vowing, quote,
[3:38:31.120 --> 3:38:36.120]  to fight till the end.
[3:38:36.120 --> 3:38:38.120]  Fight till the end?
[3:38:38.120 --> 3:38:42.120]  What's the end?
[3:38:42.120 --> 3:38:45.120]  Is the end death?
[3:38:45.120 --> 3:38:50.120]  Is it willing to fight till the end?
[3:38:50.120 --> 3:38:55.120]  Or negotiate for peace?
[3:38:55.120 --> 3:39:00.120]  To me, hey, I'd rather negotiate for peace
[3:39:00.120 --> 3:39:02.120]  than fight till the end.
[3:39:02.120 --> 3:39:07.120]  The end, the end, fight till the end,
[3:39:07.120 --> 3:39:17.120]  fight finito, over, or negotiate for peace.
[3:39:17.120 --> 3:39:21.120]  And they brag about this, how tough they are.
[3:39:21.120 --> 3:39:26.120]  All right, so here's the bet.
[3:39:26.120 --> 3:39:31.120]  Bet the trends, bet the trends.
[3:39:31.120 --> 3:39:36.120]  Russia versus Ukraine.
[3:39:36.120 --> 3:39:38.120]  There is.
[3:39:38.120 --> 3:39:41.120]  Again, I'm totally opposed to Russia's invasion.
[3:39:41.120 --> 3:39:46.120]  I want to make that 1,000% clear.
[3:39:46.120 --> 3:39:52.120]  But I also know the why's and what brought it about.
[3:39:52.120 --> 3:39:56.120]  So now I'm just putting the bet out there, you know.
[3:39:56.120 --> 3:39:58.120]  It's going into a casino.
[3:39:58.120 --> 3:40:01.120]  Place your bet, place your bet.
[3:40:01.120 --> 3:40:04.120]  Who's going to win?
[3:40:04.120 --> 3:40:10.120]  The Russia that Napoleon tried to invade Moscow in 1812
[3:40:10.120 --> 3:40:14.120]  with 420,000 soldiers came back with 10,000.
[3:40:14.120 --> 3:40:17.120]  Or the Operation Barbara Rosa launched by Hitler to kill what?
[3:40:17.120 --> 3:40:21.120]  Between 23 and 27 million Russians.
[3:40:21.120 --> 3:40:23.120]  And they were the first to defeat the Germans.
[3:40:23.120 --> 3:40:25.120]  So place your bet.
[3:40:25.120 --> 3:40:28.120]  There's going to be an end to this.
[3:40:28.120 --> 3:40:31.120]  How about negotiating for peace
[3:40:31.120 --> 3:40:37.120]  when you have more of a strengthening position
[3:40:37.120 --> 3:40:44.120]  than to keep going for war and then lose and have nothing?
[3:40:44.120 --> 3:40:47.120]  Remember, we were taught to hate those Japanese, right?
[3:40:47.120 --> 3:40:50.120]  If bombs away, not Kusaki Hiroshima,
[3:40:50.120 --> 3:40:55.120]  atom bomb, murder of Truman after the war was almost over.
[3:40:55.120 --> 3:40:56.120]  What would you rather do?
[3:40:56.120 --> 3:40:58.120]  You'd rather negotiate before or after.
[3:40:58.120 --> 3:41:00.120]  And how we were hated in those Germans.
[3:41:00.120 --> 3:41:02.120]  But now they're our allies.
[3:41:02.120 --> 3:41:04.120]  Oh, no, it's terrible Vietnamese.
[3:41:04.120 --> 3:41:10.120]  Yeah, but now we're importing our biggest second importer of clothing and shoes.
[3:41:10.120 --> 3:41:12.120]  Because they gave all our jobs away
[3:41:12.120 --> 3:41:19.120]  because of the moronic legislation that's hampered businesses.
[3:41:19.120 --> 3:41:22.120]  And the dirty deals politicians made
[3:41:22.120 --> 3:41:25.120]  to bring criminal countries into the system.
[3:41:25.120 --> 3:41:28.120]  And I'm not talking about Vietnam.
[3:41:28.120 --> 3:41:31.120]  They did nothing wrong.
[3:41:31.120 --> 3:41:34.120]  So we're in a critical stage here.
[3:41:34.120 --> 3:41:37.120]  The war talk keeps ramping up.
[3:41:37.120 --> 3:41:38.120]  So what would you do?
[3:41:38.120 --> 3:41:42.120]  Would you fight to the end?
[3:41:42.120 --> 3:41:47.120]  Or would you negotiate for peace?
[3:41:47.120 --> 3:41:52.120]  Whatever religion you believe in, whatever God you believe in,
[3:41:52.120 --> 3:41:58.120]  if your God is the God of peace, then stand up for it.
[3:41:58.120 --> 3:42:02.120]  Or succumb to Satan.
[3:42:02.120 --> 3:42:07.120]  Because that's what it's going to turn into.
[3:42:07.120 --> 3:42:11.120]  No one's talking about ending this war, negotiating.
[3:42:11.120 --> 3:42:13.120]  We'll fight to the end.
[3:42:13.120 --> 3:42:15.120]  If somebody came in here with a gun right now
[3:42:15.120 --> 3:42:17.120]  and says, Salenty, get down on the floor, give me your money.
[3:42:17.120 --> 3:42:18.120]  Okay, man, here.
[3:42:18.120 --> 3:42:19.120]  What do you want?
[3:42:19.120 --> 3:42:20.120]  I'm not going to fight.
[3:42:20.120 --> 3:42:24.120]  I'm not going to fight a losing fight.
[3:42:24.120 --> 3:42:25.120]  I fight for my life.
[3:42:25.120 --> 3:42:26.120]  I have to.
[3:42:26.120 --> 3:42:29.120]  I've been in situations.
[3:42:29.120 --> 3:42:32.120]  Grenadiers win as the losers.
[3:42:32.120 --> 3:42:35.120]  And no one's talking about peace.
[3:42:35.120 --> 3:42:39.120]  It's a dirty word.
[3:42:39.120 --> 3:42:42.120]  You're not, you're censored if you put out anything
[3:42:42.120 --> 3:42:44.120]  that they don't want to hear about,
[3:42:44.120 --> 3:42:48.120]  which goes, again, back to info wars.
[3:42:48.120 --> 3:42:55.120]  We better unite for peace, or we're going to die for war.
[3:43:18.120 --> 3:43:20.120]  It costs us $15, $20, $25 to produce.
[3:43:20.120 --> 3:43:23.120]  We used to sell for $40, we're selling them for $15,
[3:43:23.120 --> 3:43:25.120]  selling them for $20, whatever the shirt costs us.
[3:43:25.120 --> 3:43:28.120]  If the shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5
[3:43:28.120 --> 3:43:29.120]  for us to actually produce.
[3:43:29.120 --> 3:43:31.120]  If it costs $10, we're selling it for $10.
[3:43:31.120 --> 3:43:34.120]  And we've got hoodies, and we've got long sleeves,
[3:43:34.120 --> 3:43:35.120]  and we've got short sleeves.
[3:43:35.120 --> 3:43:37.120]  We've got them all, and we've got to liquidate them all.
[3:43:37.120 --> 3:43:40.120]  And they're limited edition, because we're never going to
[3:43:40.120 --> 3:43:42.120]  make any of these designs.
[3:43:42.120 --> 3:43:44.120]  Again, we are going to come out with some new designs
[3:43:44.120 --> 3:43:47.120]  that will be limited and limited edition in the future.
[3:43:47.120 --> 3:43:49.120]  We've got to sell this to keep info wars on the air,
[3:43:49.120 --> 3:43:52.120]  plus it spreads the word, infowarstore.com.
[3:43:52.120 --> 3:43:55.120]  Hear historic apparel now, infowarstore.com.
[3:43:55.120 --> 3:43:58.120]  The first ten amendments to our country's constitution
[3:43:58.120 --> 3:44:00.120]  were adopted in 1791.
[3:44:00.120 --> 3:44:04.120]  The first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech
[3:44:04.120 --> 3:44:05.120]  and free press.
[3:44:05.120 --> 3:44:09.120]  Free speech means the free and public expression of opinions
[3:44:09.120 --> 3:44:14.120]  without censorship, interference, and restraint by the government.
[3:44:14.120 --> 3:44:19.120]  231 years later, free speech across America is under chronic
[3:44:19.120 --> 3:44:23.120]  and insidious attack. GCN is under attack.
[3:44:23.120 --> 3:44:26.120]  Your freedom is currently under siege from those who do not
[3:44:26.120 --> 3:44:28.120]  want you to know the truth.
[3:44:28.120 --> 3:44:32.120]  I'm asking our fellow broadcasters and you to rise up
[3:44:32.120 --> 3:44:36.120]  and help us defend our right to continue telling you the truth.

[3:45:24.120 --> 3:45:27.120]  you talk about waking people up, Alex Jones was right.
[3:45:27.120 --> 3:45:29.120]  Fundraiser shirt, we need the funds to operate.
[3:45:29.120 --> 3:45:32.120]  Infowarstore.com, Alex Jones was right.

[3:46:37.120 --> 3:46:39.120]  the Infowar's operation.

[3:47:00.120 --> 3:47:14.120]  it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:14.120 --> 3:47:19.120]  Waging war on corruption, it's Gerald Salente.
[3:47:19.120 --> 3:47:24.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:24.120 --> 3:47:26.120]  Hey, great being on Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:26.120 --> 3:47:29.120]  Remember to do everything you can to support InfoWars.

[3:47:35.120 --> 3:47:37.120]  They've got some great products out there.
[3:47:37.120 --> 3:47:40.120]  They're mental clarity.
[3:47:40.120 --> 3:47:43.120]  It takes you to the next level, brain force ultra.
[3:47:43.120 --> 3:47:46.120]  It's 40% off in brain force, boy.
[3:47:46.120 --> 3:47:49.120]  That's a dying thing right now.
[3:47:49.120 --> 3:47:50.120]  Listen, do what you can.
[3:47:50.120 --> 3:47:53.120]  InfoWars, they've got an emergency sale going on.
[3:47:53.120 --> 3:47:55.120]  It's a blowout sale.
[3:47:55.120 --> 3:47:56.120]  Stop now.
[3:47:56.120 --> 3:48:02.120]  And again, your mental clarity, it's whoever talks about this.
[3:48:02.120 --> 3:48:04.120]  Nobody talks about mental clarity,
[3:48:04.120 --> 3:48:06.120]  just like with the whole COVID war.
[3:48:06.120 --> 3:48:08.120]  Nobody talked about getting in better shape.
[3:48:08.120 --> 3:48:10.120]  It was a dirty word.
[3:48:10.120 --> 3:48:12.120]  So they got survival shield.
[3:48:12.120 --> 3:48:15.120]  They got all these great products.
[3:48:15.120 --> 3:48:21.120]  And so do what you can, brain force plus and alpha GBC,
[3:48:21.120 --> 3:48:29.120]  green coffee beans, urban leaf, green tea leaves,
[3:48:29.120 --> 3:48:30.120]  ginkgo leaves.
[3:48:30.120 --> 3:48:33.120]  Yep, one great product after another.
[3:48:33.120 --> 3:48:36.120]  Really, and it's not like you're giving money away.
[3:48:36.120 --> 3:48:38.120]  You're getting a lot back for it.
[3:48:38.120 --> 3:48:40.120]  You're getting great products and you're getting information
[3:48:40.120 --> 3:48:42.120]  that you can't get anywhere.
[3:48:42.120 --> 3:48:46.120]  Twitch issues, bans to fight pro-Moscow propaganda.
[3:48:46.120 --> 3:48:49.120]  This is from the Financial Times.
[3:48:49.120 --> 3:48:53.120]  Amazon and Twitch has moved to ban several accounts
[3:48:53.120 --> 3:48:56.120]  on the live streaming platforms after research detailed
[3:48:56.120 --> 3:49:00.120]  how pro-Kremlin propaganda had spread on the network.
[3:49:00.120 --> 3:49:08.120]  I'm mentioning this because pro-Kremlin propaganda
[3:49:08.120 --> 3:49:11.120]  after research detailed, oh, research detailed.
[3:49:11.120 --> 3:49:12.120]  Oh, Mr. Research.
[3:49:12.120 --> 3:49:13.120]  Oh, no, Mrs. Research.
[3:49:13.120 --> 3:49:17.120]  No, transgender research detailed.
[3:49:17.120 --> 3:49:21.120]  Who's this research that detailed this?
[3:49:21.120 --> 3:49:24.120]  You're not allowed to say what they don't want you to say
[3:49:24.120 --> 3:49:25.120]  on Amazon.
[3:49:25.120 --> 3:49:29.120]  You're not allowed to say what they won't allow you to say
[3:49:29.120 --> 3:49:32.120]  on Facebook.
[3:49:32.120 --> 3:49:35.120]  You're not allowed to say, hey, this is research,
[3:49:35.120 --> 3:49:38.120]  detailed research.
[3:49:38.120 --> 3:49:43.120]  Yeah, on Pichai, this is Google research.
[3:49:43.120 --> 3:49:44.120]  What do you know?
[3:49:44.120 --> 3:49:46.120]  We know.
[3:49:46.120 --> 3:49:47.120]  We'll tell you.
[3:49:47.120 --> 3:49:49.120]  That's why he got his support info.
[3:49:49.120 --> 3:49:50.120]  Is it right?
[3:49:50.120 --> 3:49:52.120]  Okay.
[3:49:52.120 --> 3:49:54.120]  Same thing with our magazine, the Trends Journal.
[3:49:54.120 --> 3:49:56.120]  You're not getting anything like this anyway.
[3:49:56.120 --> 3:49:57.120]  TrendsJournal.com.
[3:49:57.120 --> 3:49:59.120]  Again, I was just looking at this issue.
[3:49:59.120 --> 3:50:03.120]  You know, war or peace, we the people should decide,
[3:50:03.120 --> 3:50:07.120]  taking us to the Ukraine war back in 2014.
[3:50:07.120 --> 3:50:08.120]  All right?
[3:50:08.120 --> 3:50:11.120]  Right there, 2014.
[3:50:11.120 --> 3:50:13.120]  Now, they overthrew the government of Yanukovych
[3:50:13.120 --> 3:50:15.120]  on and on and on all the details
[3:50:15.120 --> 3:50:17.120]  because he wouldn't make a deal with the International
[3:50:17.120 --> 3:50:20.120]  Mafia Monetary Fund.
[3:50:20.120 --> 3:50:23.120]  He'd rather do a deal with Russia.
[3:50:23.120 --> 3:50:27.120]  So, going back to the, before I go back into the war,
[3:50:27.120 --> 3:50:32.120]  before I want to talk about the economy,
[3:50:32.120 --> 3:50:35.120]  we're going to go into the worst financial crisis
[3:50:35.120 --> 3:50:37.120]  in human history.
[3:50:37.120 --> 3:50:39.120]  The trillions of dollars that they pumped into
[3:50:39.120 --> 3:50:42.120]  artificially boost the markets when they call the COVID war,
[3:50:42.120 --> 3:50:45.120]  they've destroyed businesses beyond the belief,
[3:50:45.120 --> 3:50:47.120]  beyond the belief.
[3:50:47.120 --> 3:50:49.120]  They're not coming back.
[3:50:49.120 --> 3:50:50.120]  They're gone.
[3:50:50.120 --> 3:50:55.120]  A third of the dry cleaners went out of business.
[3:50:55.120 --> 3:51:00.120]  The office occupancy rate in New York City
[3:51:00.120 --> 3:51:03.120]  is 67% below what it used to be.
[3:51:03.120 --> 3:51:05.120]  All right?
[3:51:05.120 --> 3:51:10.120]  So, let's say it came back to 50%, big deal.
[3:51:10.120 --> 3:51:16.120]  This is what the damage it's done is unprecedented.
[3:51:16.120 --> 3:51:21.120]  And all the cheap money they did to artificially pump it up.
[3:51:21.120 --> 3:51:23.120]  So, what's going on?
[3:51:23.120 --> 3:51:26.120]  There's a thing called the Plunge Protection Team,
[3:51:26.120 --> 3:51:28.120]  and it's a rigged game.
[3:51:28.120 --> 3:51:30.120]  It's the banksters rigging the markets.
[3:51:30.120 --> 3:51:33.120]  Every time they go down, they try to boost them back up.
[3:51:33.120 --> 3:51:38.120]  That'll work for a bit, but it's much bigger than that, right?
[3:51:38.120 --> 3:51:40.120]  It's one after another.
[3:51:40.120 --> 3:51:42.120]  We put all the data in the magazine,
[3:51:42.120 --> 3:51:46.120]  but today one just came out where the price of corn
[3:51:46.120 --> 3:51:51.120]  hits nine-year high as surge in commodities continues.
[3:51:51.120 --> 3:51:53.120]  One commodity after another.
[3:51:53.120 --> 3:51:57.120]  That's that guy Powell, the clown playing the Fed head,
[3:51:57.120 --> 3:52:02.120]  who lied to us or was stupid over a year ago,
[3:52:02.120 --> 3:52:06.120]  and we said, no, this inflation thing is really going to take off.
[3:52:06.120 --> 3:52:10.120]  Gold, by the way, today was up over $2,000 an ounce,
[3:52:10.120 --> 3:52:12.120]  backed off a bit.
[3:52:12.120 --> 3:52:16.120]  It was in the high 1980s when I got back online
[3:52:16.120 --> 3:52:20.120]  and started to show here.
[3:52:20.120 --> 3:52:22.120]  Why?
[3:52:22.120 --> 3:52:24.120]  Even though they're going to raise interest rates,
[3:52:24.120 --> 3:52:27.120]  inflation is skyrocketing.
[3:52:27.120 --> 3:52:31.120]  And that guy Powell, what did he tell us?
[3:52:31.120 --> 3:52:33.120]  It was temporary.
[3:52:33.120 --> 3:52:36.120]  It's transitory.
[3:52:36.120 --> 3:52:37.120]  No, no, no.
[3:52:37.120 --> 3:52:39.120]  It's transgendatory.
[3:52:39.120 --> 3:52:43.120]  That's what we have here, all right?
[3:52:43.120 --> 3:52:47.120]  That's what happened with inflation.
[3:52:47.120 --> 3:52:48.120]  It's real.
[3:52:48.120 --> 3:52:49.120]  It's big.
[3:52:49.120 --> 3:52:51.120]  And it's getting worse.
[3:52:51.120 --> 3:52:58.120]  Oil prices today will back up to like $114 a barrel for Brent Crude.
[3:52:58.120 --> 3:53:02.120]  The prices are going to keep going up.
[3:53:02.120 --> 3:53:04.120]  Again, our dad is all in the magazine.
[3:53:04.120 --> 3:53:05.120]  Your wages are going up.
[3:53:05.120 --> 3:53:07.120]  They're not even close to inflation.
[3:53:07.120 --> 3:53:09.120]  And when you look at the real inflation numbers,
[3:53:09.120 --> 3:53:11.120]  it's double what they're showing us.
[3:53:11.120 --> 3:53:16.120]  Go to John Williams' shadow stats.
[3:53:16.120 --> 3:53:20.120]  This is very serious what's happening.
[3:53:20.120 --> 3:53:23.120]  And it's only going to get more serious.
[3:53:23.120 --> 3:53:27.120]  You know, I was yelling and screaming before when I got on the air
[3:53:27.120 --> 3:53:30.120]  after hearing Alex Jones's passionate plea
[3:53:30.120 --> 3:53:32.120]  for people to stand up and help.
[3:53:32.120 --> 3:53:35.120]  Because I know how bad this thing is going to go.
[3:53:35.120 --> 3:53:39.120]  And just as I read to you where they're blocking out that Amazon,
[3:53:39.120 --> 3:53:40.120]  it's one after another.
[3:53:40.120 --> 3:53:42.120]  Censorship is the new word.
[3:53:42.120 --> 3:53:45.120]  We've been writing about this for years.
[3:53:45.120 --> 3:53:51.120]  I used to be on everybody, the Today Show, Good Morning America,
[3:53:51.120 --> 3:53:57.120]  O'Reilly, Fox & Friends, Oprah.
[3:53:57.120 --> 3:53:59.120]  Often, often.
[3:53:59.120 --> 3:54:02.120]  But black, black bald.
[3:54:02.120 --> 3:54:05.120]  Oh, and how many people hate me for going on with Alex Jones?
[3:54:05.120 --> 3:54:06.120]  Are you kidding?
[3:54:06.120 --> 3:54:07.120]  How can you go on there?
[3:54:07.120 --> 3:54:08.120]  What are you even talking about?
[3:54:08.120 --> 3:54:10.120]  I say what I say.
[3:54:10.120 --> 3:54:13.120]  It's free speech.
[3:54:13.120 --> 3:54:15.120]  Does Alex agree with everything that I say?
[3:54:15.120 --> 3:54:16.120]  No.
[3:54:16.120 --> 3:54:17.120]  Do I agree with everything?
[3:54:17.120 --> 3:54:18.120]  No.
[3:54:18.120 --> 3:54:20.120]  It's putting out information.
[3:54:20.120 --> 3:54:23.120]  And the bottom line is think for yourself.
[3:54:23.120 --> 3:54:26.120]  I'll do everything I can to support InfoWars
[3:54:26.120 --> 3:54:28.120]  and the InfoWars staff.
[3:54:28.120 --> 3:54:30.120]  I shoot that doing.
[3:54:30.120 --> 3:54:32.120]  Every day I go on to the news.
[3:54:32.120 --> 3:54:35.120]  I go from the Global Times in China
[3:54:35.120 --> 3:54:41.120]  to Fars News Agency in Iran to Jerusalem Post in Israel
[3:54:41.120 --> 3:54:47.120]  to InfoWars, to Bloomberg, to CNBC.
[3:54:47.120 --> 3:54:51.120]  InfoWars is right in there.
[3:54:51.120 --> 3:54:54.120]  They're telling you a lot of great stories
[3:54:54.120 --> 3:54:57.120]  about information that could really help you.
[3:54:57.120 --> 3:55:01.120]  So do what you can.
[3:55:01.120 --> 3:55:03.120]  And again, we're doing all we can with the magazine,
[3:55:03.120 --> 3:55:06.120]  The Trends Journal, given you there's nothing like it.
[3:55:06.120 --> 3:55:09.120]  But anyway, I want to go back to this war.
[3:55:09.120 --> 3:55:12.120]  U.S. causes humanitarian disasters around the globe,
[3:55:12.120 --> 3:55:14.120]  killing innocent civilians,
[3:55:14.120 --> 3:55:16.120]  and creating millions of refugees.
[3:55:16.120 --> 3:55:19.120]  Who said this?
[3:55:19.120 --> 3:55:24.120]  China, Global Times last Friday.
[3:55:24.120 --> 3:55:26.120]  Then they have these stories.
[3:55:26.120 --> 3:55:29.120]  Ukraine crisis instigator.
[3:55:29.120 --> 3:55:33.120]  U.S.-led NATO renegs on not one inch eastward promise
[3:55:33.120 --> 3:55:36.120]  to compress Russia's space to the extreme.
[3:55:36.120 --> 3:55:38.120]  Number two, instability brewer.
[3:55:38.120 --> 3:55:44.120]  Behind every war with turmoil in the world
[3:55:44.120 --> 3:55:48.120]  is the shadow of the star-spangled banner.
[3:55:48.120 --> 3:55:50.120]  Vampires in the war, U.S. war mongers
[3:55:50.120 --> 3:55:53.120]  feeding on the bloody turbulence of other countries.
[3:55:53.120 --> 3:55:56.120]  This is from the Financial Times.
[3:55:56.120 --> 3:56:00.120]  So, bet the trends.
[3:56:00.120 --> 3:56:05.120]  I said Ukraine versus Russia, the winner is.
[3:56:05.120 --> 3:56:06.120]  Russia...
[3:56:06.120 --> 3:56:09.120]  Remember, I just read you came from the Global Times in China.
[3:56:09.120 --> 3:56:15.120]  China and Russia versus U.S. and NATO.
[3:56:15.120 --> 3:56:17.120]  The winner is.
[3:56:17.120 --> 3:56:19.120]  Who's going to win?
[3:56:19.120 --> 3:56:22.120]  Who you place your bet on?
[3:56:22.120 --> 3:56:28.120]  Well, speaking for myself,
[3:56:28.120 --> 3:56:34.120]  let's say India has 1.4 billion people.
[3:56:34.120 --> 3:56:37.120]  Then you throw in Russia.
[3:56:37.120 --> 3:56:39.120]  You almost bought it.
[3:56:39.120 --> 3:56:44.120]  I don't know how many million I got.
[3:56:44.120 --> 3:56:47.120]  But even 1.6 million, let's say.
[3:56:47.120 --> 3:56:49.120]  1.6 billion.
[3:56:49.120 --> 3:56:53.120]  You got 770,000 U.S. and NATO combined.
[3:56:53.120 --> 3:56:56.120]  You think you're going to beat them?
[3:56:56.120 --> 3:56:59.120]  America hasn't won a war since World War II.
[3:56:59.120 --> 3:57:02.120]  Hey, wasn't that a great exit that Biden did with Afghanistan?
[3:57:02.120 --> 3:57:04.120]  Oh, he's a brilliant, brilliant guy.
[3:57:04.120 --> 3:57:07.120]  And he's just as smart in what he's doing now with Ukraine.
[3:57:07.120 --> 3:57:10.120]  Winner there and a winner here.
[3:57:10.120 --> 3:57:14.120]  How could people keep betting on these losers?
[3:57:14.120 --> 3:57:17.120]  What if I had a magazine out
[3:57:17.120 --> 3:57:23.120]  and every piece of information I gave you was wrong?
[3:57:23.120 --> 3:57:27.120]  But here, every piece of work that they've done in war has been wrong.
[3:57:27.120 --> 3:57:29.120]  And yet they're telling us how to win one.
[3:57:29.120 --> 3:57:33.120]  Look at this tragedy of Afghanistan.
[3:57:33.120 --> 3:57:38.120]  And now he's leading us to war against Russia.
[3:57:38.120 --> 3:57:40.120]  Okay, we're going to see you next week.
[3:57:40.120 --> 3:57:42.120]  Remember, support InfoWars.
[3:57:42.120 --> 3:57:44.120]  Keep Truth Alive.
[3:57:44.120 --> 3:57:47.120]  You know, it's a fact, and I'm not bragging when I say it.
[3:57:47.120 --> 3:57:50.120]  It's just true that InfoWars is seen by the globalist
[3:57:50.120 --> 3:57:53.120]  as the standard of human liberty,
[3:57:53.120 --> 3:57:57.120]  as the logo of human populist resistance
[3:57:57.120 --> 3:58:01.120]  against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[3:58:01.120 --> 3:58:07.120]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects
[3:58:07.120 --> 3:58:09.120]  of what we've ever done.
[3:58:09.120 --> 3:58:13.120]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products,
[3:58:13.120 --> 3:58:15.120]  and some of them at InfoWarsTour.com.
[3:58:15.120 --> 3:58:18.120]  And we are funded by listeners and viewers like you.
[3:58:18.120 --> 3:58:21.120]  And so now we need to support more than ever
[3:58:21.120 --> 3:58:23.120]  because this fight has intensified.
[3:58:23.120 --> 3:58:26.120]  Don't need me to tell you that at InfoWarsTour.com.
[3:58:26.120 --> 3:58:30.120]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now.
[3:58:30.120 --> 3:58:32.120]  Things have been sold out for a long time,
[3:58:32.120 --> 3:58:35.120]  like InfoWars Life, Physi Magnesium Mix,
[3:58:35.120 --> 3:58:39.120]  that's so amazing, and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[3:58:39.120 --> 3:58:42.120]  They're all available 25 to 75% off
[3:58:42.120 --> 3:58:44.120]  at InfoWarsTour.com right now.
[3:59:12.120 --> 3:59:16.120]  Or to put a sticker on your car, or banner hangs over highways,
[3:59:16.120 --> 3:59:18.120]  and it will be a chain reaction.
[3:59:18.120 --> 3:59:20.120]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[3:59:20.120 --> 3:59:21.120]  I have a few ideas.
[3:59:21.120 --> 3:59:24.120]  First of all, I'll stress that when you fall into a farm,
[3:59:24.120 --> 3:59:26.120]  arrest fouls, arrest fouls too often.
[3:59:26.120 --> 3:59:27.120]  The vaccine is poison.
[3:59:27.120 --> 3:59:28.120]  There's tons of things.
[3:59:28.120 --> 3:59:29.120]  I say keep it short, keep it concise.
[3:59:29.120 --> 3:59:30.120]  No, I agree.
[3:59:30.120 --> 3:59:32.120]  Arrest fouls, arrest bill gates.
[3:59:32.120 --> 3:59:34.120]  The COVID-19 vaccine is poison.
[3:59:34.120 --> 3:59:35.120]  Beautiful.
[3:59:35.120 --> 3:59:36.120]  Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved
[3:59:36.120 --> 3:59:37.120]  and we could all be effective.
[3:59:37.120 --> 3:59:38.120]  So that's what I'm calling about.
[3:59:38.120 --> 3:59:39.120]  God bless you, Chris.
[3:59:39.120 --> 3:59:43.120]  In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[3:59:43.120 --> 4:00:12.120]  Thank you so much.
