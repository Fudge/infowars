[00:00.000 --> 00:06.640]  Laughing at deranged social justice warriors. It's so 2016. I mean, it's just such low-hanging fruit
[00:06.640 --> 00:12.320]  It's so cliched at this point tonight thousands of people's and cities across the country will scream
[00:12.320 --> 00:29.280]  Helplessly at the sky one year after the election of president Donald Trump all right and one more time
[00:42.320 --> 00:44.320]  I
[00:44.320 --> 00:58.160]  I was thinking this reminds me of something what could it be
[01:14.320 --> 01:16.320]  Oh
[01:16.320 --> 01:40.080]  You're re-enacting the two minutes of hate out of 1984 you're literally Orwellian
[01:47.120 --> 01:55.040]  We're dealing with the daycare generation. Why do you think college safe spaces now have crayons and puppies to cuddle
[01:55.120 --> 01:59.680]  We're dealing with infants who learned that screaming was how you got your own way
[01:59.680 --> 02:15.680]  Well, this is the adult world snowflakes and things just don't work like that
[02:16.240 --> 02:21.600]  Oh sweet taste of liberal tears tell a lie. It's not sweet. It's what's that taste?
[02:22.560 --> 02:26.720]  Salty, but I've got to say I was looking forward to this immeasurably
[02:26.720 --> 02:32.240]  And you kind of let me down. I mean you had lower energy than Jeb Bush on a debate stage
[02:32.320 --> 02:39.200]  Someone forgot to take their brain force in Austin our own Owen Shroyer screamed for longer than the actual protesters
[02:39.280 --> 02:41.280]  I'll get it kicked off here
[02:44.960 --> 02:48.240]  A handful of them turned up for 10 minutes and left
[02:48.880 --> 02:52.240]  And uh, excuse me ma'am. What are you doing? Excuse me?
[02:52.240 --> 02:57.040]  Excuse me. Why are you blocking our free speech? You've got some sort of aquamarine character here
[02:57.120 --> 03:03.760]  He's got a uh old school uh like type of a diverse scuba mask on or something here and then he's got a uh
[03:04.880 --> 03:06.880]  He's got a homemade
[03:06.880 --> 03:10.960]  homemade sort of megaphone here that he's putting into a stuffed turtle's mouth
[03:10.960 --> 03:18.880]  This is actually happening. This is actually happening
[03:24.560 --> 03:30.240]  Is this really what George Soros is spending his 18 billion dollars on I'd ask for a refund
[03:30.240 --> 03:41.200]  Maybe they think it's a kind of mating call that will attract a sexual partner
[03:44.400 --> 03:51.200]  Because let's be fair they need all the help they can get but seriously you guys truly do put the TARD in libtard
[03:51.200 --> 04:03.840]  You hear that kids? That's the sound of a democrat party buying. Please keep
[04:04.400 --> 04:09.120]  Autistically screeching. Please keep calling anyone with a different opinion a Nazi
[04:09.120 --> 04:13.840]  You don't need to be videotaping these people do on twitter every day with them. Why is something like this?
[04:16.320 --> 04:20.320]  Please keep having no actual policies or arguments because this
[04:23.360 --> 04:25.360]  This is why trump won
[04:29.520 --> 04:35.440]  It's friday november 10th 2017 i'm alex schoen's your host i'm gonna be here for the next four hours
[04:35.440 --> 04:38.560]  And oh and shroyer comes up after that with the war room

[06:00.240 --> 06:15.360]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war

[06:30.640 --> 06:33.120]  But then full wars.com and yours truly alex jones

[06:38.880 --> 06:41.360]  The last 20 something years. We got brain chips
[06:42.160 --> 06:43.760]  that are just gonna
[06:43.760 --> 06:45.760]  turning into superhumans
[06:46.960 --> 06:52.640]  And of course all of it is about dehumanizing all of it is about control all of it has trojan horses in it
[06:52.640 --> 07:00.080]  I'm not a troglodyte. I'm not somebody that is a anti technology person, but I know that this is part of a large plan
[07:00.800 --> 07:04.640]  abc news cbs news nbc news associate press all unified
[07:05.440 --> 07:07.440]  spewing the globalist line

[07:15.520 --> 07:22.640]  15 years ago saying you'll have chips. You belong to an incredible new brave future. These are quotes
[07:23.200 --> 07:28.000]  Not the tired old sad past but the future. You know better than your parents
[07:29.120 --> 07:32.640]  Now I would read that on air and the media would say it's not true. He's insane
[07:33.280 --> 07:36.960]  Because the older folks weren't supposed to know what was going on with the younger folks
[07:38.320 --> 07:45.120]  And the conditioning and that ties into human brains being implanted in rat brains and all the rest of what we're going down the rabbit hole
[07:45.120 --> 07:47.120]  Today at the bottom of the hour
[07:48.320 --> 07:50.640]  I'll give you the rest of the story. Let me give you
[07:52.480 --> 07:54.960]  The news of 20 years from now today
[07:55.680 --> 07:59.200]  I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna do a whole segment like we're broadcasting
[08:01.920 --> 08:03.920]  From 2037
[08:06.080 --> 08:08.080]  It is the year 2037
[08:08.080 --> 08:10.080]  You
[08:13.040 --> 08:18.480]  Mutagenic bioplagues have reduced the population by over 90%
[08:21.280 --> 08:23.280]  A sentient overclass
[08:24.800 --> 08:27.680]  Of ai computers are now in control
[08:32.480 --> 08:37.120]  Here's what what davos says welcome to 2030 I own nothing
[08:37.120 --> 08:41.840]  Have no privacy and life has never been better
[08:42.560 --> 08:46.400]  And you will take the chip you will assimilate
[08:50.800 --> 08:56.000]  Print me that one too. Thank you. So first let me give you the big news
[09:00.720 --> 09:03.040]  You notice mainstream media yesterday didn't cover it
[09:03.040 --> 09:10.080]  Wikileaks put out a new data dump always with impeccable accuracy
[09:10.960 --> 09:12.960]  vault 8
[09:13.120 --> 09:15.360]  CIA hacking tools on how to frame
[09:16.240 --> 09:22.720]  Everybody from americans like trump to the russians to everybody else and more we wrote about it
[09:25.360 --> 09:27.360]  Matt drudge red linked it last night
[09:27.360 --> 09:33.680]  And it forced some media to grudgingly carry it today. That's why they spend all day calling us fake news
[09:33.840 --> 09:40.160]  That's why they spend all day demonizing us because if there wasn't in full wars.com or a drudge report.com to magnify it
[09:40.480 --> 09:44.000]  Now moved halfway down the page. You'd never see it
[09:46.560 --> 09:50.560]  And that's why they're engaged in disinformation campaigns against us
[09:51.280 --> 09:54.560]  24-7 because they understand that
[09:54.560 --> 10:01.360]  They don't understand that we continue to force news out. That's real news that they don't want discussed like this
[10:04.800 --> 10:08.000]  CNS news it's it's it's good to see CNS news
[10:09.440 --> 10:14.640]  Realizing how serious this is and it's good to see congress sing because they've already canvassed congress
[10:17.440 --> 10:19.440]  We broke that with
[10:19.440 --> 10:25.200]  Witnesses months ago. They've already gone around and found out how many people are going to go along with the martial law
[10:27.200 --> 10:31.440]  That's going to follow a coup against the president
[10:33.200 --> 10:35.200]  And now from the house floor
[10:36.720 --> 10:42.080]  Representative gates quote we are at risk of a coup d'etat
[10:42.080 --> 10:49.600]  In this country unless Mueller resigns or is fired and that's exactly what I've said
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.400]  It is a deep state coup of the deputy attorney general of a clinton
[10:55.120 --> 10:59.680]  Bush globalist obama operative who is up to his eyeballs in real russian collusion
[11:01.440 --> 11:03.440]  And then they're running around saying tucker carlson
[11:04.080 --> 11:09.600]  Matt grudge alex jones ran paul our agents of the kremlin should I play?
[11:09.600 --> 11:15.360]  Congressional hearings john mccain saying rand paul is now an agent of the kremlin
[11:16.320 --> 11:18.320]  preposterous
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.160]  Matt drudge linked thousands of times to russian news stations and tv stations
[11:24.320 --> 11:28.960]  Yeah, a thousand times and then ten thousand times the new york times. They do the same stuff with us
[11:29.760 --> 11:37.280]  Look jones is posting pieces of articles. It's plagiarism when you have the source saying who it is. It's not plagiarism
[11:37.280 --> 11:39.280]  But that's how they manipulate. They're
[11:40.160 --> 11:44.800]  They're reading on it just look jones posted three paragraphs of a cnn article
[11:44.880 --> 11:51.760]  He's plagiarizing them when you post a blurb to show people that what you're covering really is happening and a link to somebody
[11:51.760 --> 11:55.440]  It's a favorite to them, but they spend that stop the plagiarism
[11:56.320 --> 12:00.880]  Knowing the general public. I guess isn't internet savvy or whatever to know. That's how the internets work for 20 years
[12:01.360 --> 12:03.360]  But that's what they do. That's how they operate
[12:03.360 --> 12:10.160]  Assaulting reality, you know, I told you a month ago that the hate hoax at the air force base
[12:10.560 --> 12:14.240]  With the n-word taped to the vending machine was a staged event
[12:14.320 --> 12:20.080]  How did I know the way they rolled it out within hours the way it was all scripted? It was a production
[12:22.000 --> 12:25.360]  And now it was all a hoax. I'm proven right again
[12:25.360 --> 12:33.280]  Donna brazil says she wants seth rich investigated and fears for her life and is pointing at hillary clinton. I'm sorry right again
[12:35.840 --> 12:36.880]  Oh
[12:36.880 --> 12:43.280]  We were right that trump was gonna get elected right again. That's why they're pulling their hair out. They don't know what to do
[12:43.760 --> 12:45.760]  But here it is
[12:47.120 --> 12:49.120]  House representatives met
[12:49.120 --> 12:56.800]  Gates of florida called on special counsel robert muller who is investigating alleged russian collusion with the trump 2016 campaign
[12:57.280 --> 13:02.640]  To resign because there is an apparent conflict of interest involving muller and an alleged campaign
[13:02.880 --> 13:06.480]  To undermine the president and force him from office on a ledge campaign
[13:06.720 --> 13:11.200]  They admit the campaign of the deep state that'll destroy us seven ways from sunday
[13:11.200 --> 13:19.840]  He also called for a special prosecutor to investigate iranium one scandal the clinton foundation and the fusion gps firm and of course
[13:20.160 --> 13:24.160]  Buzzfeed and the made-up wee-wee gate peepie gate
[13:25.600 --> 13:29.360]  The platinum standard of fake news buzzfeed
[13:31.680 --> 13:37.920]  Buzzfeed investigators discovered alex jones linked to and posted articles out of russia
[13:37.920 --> 13:45.280]  You invest did you find the sun in the sky you're hidden on his website with millions of daily readers?
[13:47.040 --> 13:53.920]  You know tell us some more twisted weird garbage. That's that's how they operate. There's your russia connection. Why matt drudge linked to the russians
[13:53.920 --> 13:56.880]  Yeah, I've also linked to the cia this week
[13:57.840 --> 14:03.440]  And I've also linked to buzzfeed doesn't mean I agree with them. I've also linked to
[14:04.320 --> 14:05.680]  congressional
[14:05.680 --> 14:14.640]  I've also linked to congressional reports and bills and voice of america and publish all of the voice of america articles when I think they're
[14:14.640 --> 14:19.440]  Industry or informative because it's taxpayer paid for and under rulings. I can use it
[14:20.320 --> 14:26.480]  Remember when obama tried to put copyrights on a white house photos and said the public couldn't use them when he didn't like some of them
[14:28.160 --> 14:30.160]  They lost in court on that by the way
[14:30.560 --> 14:31.600]  See that's how that works
[14:31.600 --> 14:37.920]  So they want to play these games and stifle free speech by attacking it and saying if you link to what putin says
[14:38.160 --> 14:41.280]  Or you link to what russia reports for their perspective?
[14:41.680 --> 14:45.840]  You're a russian agent, but when you're on the tarmac giving them uranium
[14:48.240 --> 14:50.560]  When you're in 10 different companies with them
[14:52.960 --> 14:58.000]  When all of this is going on and and hillary's in bed with them and hundreds of millions of dollars and
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.320]  All these millions of dollars in speeches all completely illegal. Oh, that's okay
[15:04.160 --> 15:06.160]  But oh rand paul
[15:07.600 --> 15:11.600]  Is a russian agent according to mckay remember on the floor of the senate that man
[15:12.880 --> 15:14.880]  senator
[15:16.400 --> 15:18.560]  Rand paul is now working with the kremlin
[15:20.400 --> 15:22.400]  And remember congressman on
[15:22.400 --> 15:28.160]  Fox news anybody challenged them they go you're with the kremlin now. I mean it's ridiculous
[15:28.400 --> 15:32.960]  But they try to bully everyone the submission with this preposperous garbage
[15:33.760 --> 15:34.880]  and
[15:34.880 --> 15:36.880]  And the goal of it
[15:36.960 --> 15:38.560]  The over-the-top
[15:38.560 --> 15:44.160]  arrogance of hiding in plain view. They're the ones selling america out not just to russia
[15:44.320 --> 15:47.760]  But to anybody that'll pay hand over fist
[15:47.760 --> 15:54.160]  And then pointing their fat fingers back at us saying we're the ones when we are as pure as a driven snow

[18:11.840 --> 18:17.200]  60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs
[18:17.360 --> 18:24.560]  They had drums of their own air raid sirens, but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war
[18:24.560 --> 18:31.760]  Pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones

[19:56.000 --> 20:06.640]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[20:06.640 --> 20:23.280]  From the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[20:37.040 --> 20:43.120]  There's been a new french car attack
[20:43.680 --> 20:47.520]  She's driving a liberally plow into a crowd of pupils children
[20:48.320 --> 20:50.320]  near to loose high school
[20:51.200 --> 20:52.640]  Wow
[20:52.640 --> 20:56.400]  I don't even want to watch the video, but I guess we should probably show it to you coming up later
[20:57.200 --> 21:01.600]  I want to break down all this technology news superhumans chips inserted into brains
[21:01.600 --> 21:08.320]  We'll give us mind-blowing abilities within years. See they're just selling it with breathlessly, but it's so wonderful
[21:08.880 --> 21:13.040]  But then the smartphones all of it actually lower our accuse make us more miserable
[21:13.760 --> 21:15.760]  and the former president of
[21:17.520 --> 21:19.120]  Facebook
[21:19.120 --> 21:21.120]  has gone public
[21:21.200 --> 21:23.680]  And said that it's designed to make you
[21:25.120 --> 21:26.640]  Lonely and alone
[21:26.640 --> 21:28.640]  and praise on you
[21:28.640 --> 21:30.400]  well, I don't need to
[21:30.400 --> 21:32.400]  Just believe mr. Parker
[21:33.520 --> 21:35.520]  In january of this year
[21:35.600 --> 21:38.880]  Documents were leaked by facebook executives in australia
[21:42.720 --> 21:45.120]  Bragging about how they're targeting their prisoners
[21:46.080 --> 21:54.080]  And how the left is their main group that they vampirically feed on because they keep totally depressed totally upset and then have bots that are fake people
[21:54.080 --> 21:59.840]  Managing them and and trying to get them as mentally ill as possible. Then they run
[22:00.320 --> 22:07.280]  Serotonin reuptake inhibitor ads then they pop up psychology test ads and then induct you into the medical system
[22:07.920 --> 22:11.360]  It is a computer program AI system
[22:14.720 --> 22:19.760]  Targeting you for medicalization and then final death
[22:19.760 --> 22:24.320]  That's why they report in texas 70 plus percent of foster children are on psychotropics
[22:27.760 --> 22:32.640]  And on average they're on eight medications and many of them end up dying they're on so many medications
[22:32.960 --> 22:39.360]  Judges have gone public about and doctors have gone public how they'll take a totally healthy say four five year old and three years later
[22:39.360 --> 22:41.360]  They're dead
[22:41.360 --> 22:51.760]  It's so sick uh, okay, I said I'd get into all that future information in the next segment. It's just it's so hardcore
[22:53.520 --> 22:55.520]  Let me get this first
[22:57.200 --> 23:02.080]  When you've got the former deputy director of the fbi and the former deputy director of the cia philma
[23:02.080 --> 23:08.640]  And he's been both a Mueller protege saying we're getting ready to kill the president. That's a signal on television
[23:08.640 --> 23:13.120]  On cnn when you've got hashtag hunt republicans
[23:14.320 --> 23:17.600]  Democrats on cnn and fox saying yeah, we're gonna kill republicans
[23:18.800 --> 23:20.320]  when you've got
[23:20.320 --> 23:23.600]  republicans getting shot and killed all over the country and getting beaten and
[23:24.320 --> 23:26.320]  Attacked stab you name it
[23:26.720 --> 23:30.400]  City council people getting killed in their yards ran Paul attack congressman's police
[23:30.640 --> 23:36.000]  Churches getting attacked everywhere by his lamas is don't even hardly make the news when they attack a, you know, Tennessee church and
[23:37.280 --> 23:38.560]  Shoot a bunch of people
[23:38.560 --> 23:42.240]  Remember that or Maryland church few weeks ago most you probably never even heard of that
[23:43.200 --> 23:49.520]  She's not supposed to just supposed to target everybody and start killing and at a grassroots level try to make you
[23:50.160 --> 23:56.320]  Go underground and not have your political views so that they can dominate, but they don't want to make you a cause celeb in the medium
[23:57.680 --> 24:02.080]  And they're going around doing a poll or a canvas is what they call it
[24:02.080 --> 24:06.560]  And people drop by the congressman's office and then they say you know the president is going to be dead soon
[24:07.120 --> 24:10.080]  Where he's going to be removed and you know, you can have a future
[24:11.360 --> 24:14.880]  And still do most of what you're doing, which is always a lie that they always want more
[24:15.200 --> 24:18.800]  But you need to back down and not make a big deal about what's about to happen
[24:18.800 --> 24:22.560]  And they're testing to see if you're going to fight back if you're going to speak out
[24:22.560 --> 24:28.880]  Somebody says that to me within my arms link. I'm going to punch him in the nose
[24:31.280 --> 24:33.280]  But I have been told that over the telephone
[24:34.480 --> 24:39.040]  Okay, and I'm serious you come up and tell me that the president's not going to be alive very soon
[24:39.040 --> 24:42.400]  Better get on board with us. I'm going to punch you in the nose guarantee
[24:43.040 --> 24:45.040]  Boom, you're getting punched in the nose
[24:46.480 --> 24:48.480]  This is getting serious folks
[24:48.480 --> 24:53.520]  They're a bunch of bullies a bunch of gangsters a bunch of racketeers and they're canvassing congress
[24:55.360 --> 24:57.360]  Seeing who are cowards
[24:58.720 --> 25:02.880]  And believe me when you're looking at Mitch McConnell and all these folks, they're all compromised. They're all blackmail
[25:02.880 --> 25:07.920]  That's why they're put the positions. They are and they're not even really wanting power now. They're scared
[25:10.080 --> 25:12.080]  They're scared
[25:12.080 --> 25:15.920]  Paul Ryan all of them. They are owned men. They are puppets
[25:15.920 --> 25:18.480]  They are nobody's they are marionettes
[25:21.280 --> 25:27.280]  And they're working with the democrats to get all these republicans to resign so that trump doesn't have a majority to even get his tax cuts
[25:27.600 --> 25:29.600]  And the judge roi moorstuff
[25:29.600 --> 25:33.520]  Is beginning to disintegrate and I want to be clear the first reports. I saw yesterday
[25:34.640 --> 25:39.760]  Where that he had just told the girls they were pretty in front of their parents and then later I saw reportedly
[25:40.560 --> 25:42.560]  A mother dropped a daughter off
[25:42.560 --> 25:44.560]  It is half a month
[25:44.560 --> 25:47.200]  A mother off at his house and reportedly
[25:47.920 --> 25:49.920]  He took her pants off
[25:49.920 --> 25:54.080]  And I know it's probably not true, but you know, this stuff goes on and happens. It's epidemic. It could be true
[25:54.080 --> 25:56.080]  It's true. I think it's horrible
[25:55.920 --> 25:57.360]  but
[25:57.360 --> 25:59.360]  now
[26:00.400 --> 26:06.480]  It's coming out claim reporters secretly recorded offering woman a thousand dollars to accuse more
[26:08.080 --> 26:10.720]  accusations against more already debunked question mark
[26:10.720 --> 26:18.960]  And reportedly it's been delivered to the da's office and to the FBI needs to go directly to roi moor
[26:19.920 --> 26:21.920]  So we'll see what unfolds with that
[26:22.640 --> 26:24.800]  But they said all these same things about trump
[26:25.600 --> 26:30.560]  And it turned out those weren't true either and the people been paid to say it and then you know later recanted
[26:31.120 --> 26:32.400]  so
[26:32.400 --> 26:34.400]  We know the season we're in ladies and gentlemen
[26:35.520 --> 26:37.520]  But right now in congress
[26:37.520 --> 26:43.920]  They have mewler as this fourth branch of government
[26:44.960 --> 26:50.160]  Controlled by the globalist that is completely corrupt. It's trying to have a coup
[26:53.200 --> 26:54.400]  And
[26:54.400 --> 26:55.600]  They're moving forward with it
[26:55.600 --> 27:00.880]  They're going to use that as the pretext to then have a new election suspend most of the republicans that got elected
[27:01.200 --> 27:07.200]  And then make the democratic party a one-party permanent state where the republicans is maybe a southern breaking state
[27:07.200 --> 27:08.720]  And breakaway group
[27:08.720 --> 27:12.720]  That's their plan. That's why republicans can't join with this or go along with this
[27:13.280 --> 27:16.000]  Because the globalists know the democrats are finished
[27:17.520 --> 27:23.120]  So all they have is authoritarianism now to convert us to a full authoritarian state like venezuela with state elections
[27:23.360 --> 27:27.120]  We're here and congressman gates gets it. He does a lot of great work. Here's the clip
[27:29.360 --> 27:30.960]  And mr. Speaker
[27:30.960 --> 27:38.000]  We are at risk of a coup d'etat in this country if we allow an unaccountable person
[27:38.480 --> 27:44.160]  With no oversight to undermine the duly elected president of the united states
[27:44.160 --> 27:48.480]  And I would offer that is precisely what is happening right now with the
[27:49.200 --> 27:54.960]  Indisputable conflicts of interest that are present with mr. Mueller and others at the department of justice
[27:54.960 --> 28:02.720]  I join my colleague the gentleman from arizona in calling for mr. Mueller's resignation or his firing
[28:03.360 --> 28:08.960]  Moreover, we absolutely have to see the department of justice appoint a special council
[28:09.360 --> 28:11.360]  To look into the clinton foundation
[28:11.760 --> 28:18.560]  The uranium one deal and the fusion gps dossier that I will now have the opportunity to discuss
[28:18.560 --> 28:25.040]  I really don't know who's investigating the uranium one deal right now. I know that in july
[28:25.440 --> 28:33.040]  The chairman of the judiciary committee along with 20 members of the judiciary committee sent a letter to attorney general sessions asking
[28:33.360 --> 28:40.640]  Who would be looking into these critical questions demanding that a special council be appointed to conduct a thorough review?
[28:41.200 --> 28:44.960]  And it is extremely disappointing that the chairman of the judiciary committee
[28:44.960 --> 28:51.360]  Well, that is congressman matt gates who just keeps doing a great job. What a patriot. He is on target
[28:51.760 --> 28:56.640]  That's future presidential material right dad. He is he's ringing the alarm bell like paul revere

[32:57.120 --> 33:09.120]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[33:09.120 --> 33:25.120]  Live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[33:40.080 --> 33:42.080]  And radio
[33:43.680 --> 33:45.680]  You know, it's hard to believe
[33:48.880 --> 33:50.880]  That
[33:50.880 --> 33:54.480]  It's veterans day already tomorrow or that today is the myrtana marine corps
[33:55.280 --> 33:57.920]  But you know machines are now replacing humans
[33:58.560 --> 34:01.680]  In most of the tasks the military carries out the big problem there
[34:02.560 --> 34:04.560]  Is that then the globalists
[34:04.560 --> 34:06.560]  have autonomous
[34:06.560 --> 34:14.400]  Systems that they can program and control and it takes the human element out who can say no to illegal orders or who have a conscience
[34:15.840 --> 34:18.640]  For a long time they've been trying to turn humans into machines
[34:19.280 --> 34:21.760]  Because they couldn't invent machines that were as good as humans
[34:23.280 --> 34:25.280]  And that's really been the gold
[34:26.960 --> 34:33.280]  Superhumans chips inserted into brains will give us mind-blowing abilities within years
[34:33.280 --> 34:40.880]  But what did calculators do they've lowered the standard of arithmetic almost to nothing now
[34:41.920 --> 34:44.160]  Not against calculators. I'm saying they did this
[34:44.880 --> 34:51.600]  What does screen time in video games do most children are overweight unhealthy most adults are we get more and more obese
[34:53.120 --> 34:55.120]  Our cancer rates skyrocket
[34:55.120 --> 35:01.920]  Screen time puts us into a trance-like state
[35:02.640 --> 35:04.640]  And again
[35:05.520 --> 35:10.720]  When mainstream media wants to report about how wonderful it is implanting baby brains
[35:11.440 --> 35:15.680]  Parts of baby brains human baby brains in mice. It's cute and funny
[35:16.720 --> 35:18.720]  Because they say it's no big deal
[35:18.720 --> 35:25.040]  But then when I talk about it and say it's crazy and dehumanizing and that we shouldn't cross these lines
[35:25.440 --> 35:27.440]  Oh, then they just say jones is insane
[35:28.480 --> 35:34.160]  He claims there's human animal chimeros and cyborgs and everything. It just doesn't exist. See that's the tactic
[35:35.120 --> 35:37.120]  they use
[35:37.120 --> 35:42.160]  And there's a lot of breaking news. I'm gonna I'm gonna get into this later in the broadcast because I want to spend a lot of time on it
[35:43.440 --> 35:45.440]  I want to hit a bunch of political news right now
[35:45.440 --> 35:51.280]  Uh, quite frankly, I don't know the truth about the Roy Moore situation. I just see the circumstantial
[35:52.640 --> 35:58.400]  Situation with the establishment the desperate Republicans wanting to stop the populist Trump wave
[35:58.640 --> 36:01.440]  I looked into allegations in the past of Roy Moore
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.800]  There being some claims of harassment some claims of sexual impropriety some claims of
[36:07.360 --> 36:10.880]  pedophilia or or or or underage stuff and it was zero
[36:11.600 --> 36:13.600]  Even during the highly contested
[36:13.600 --> 36:15.600]  election
[36:17.040 --> 36:18.240]  But then
[36:18.240 --> 36:20.160]  I see new reports out today or stuff
[36:20.240 --> 36:24.480]  I missed yesterday because it broke all this live on air about a mother bringing her 14 year old daughter
[36:25.040 --> 36:27.040]  To a 35 year old man's house
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.440]  And dropping her off. I mean I find that suspect
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.560]  Of a woman that would say she did that
[36:35.280 --> 36:38.720]  And I'm not questioning or saying they're liars. I don't know
[36:39.600 --> 36:41.600]  But we saw the same stuff with trump
[36:41.600 --> 36:43.600]  And none of it was true
[36:45.440 --> 36:50.000]  But but what woman what mother brings their 14 year old daughter
[36:51.360 --> 36:54.240]  After judge Roy Moore back then I guess a prosecutor or whatever
[36:55.440 --> 37:00.000]  Says I boy, I think you're pretty because that's the first thing I read but there was no quote sex
[37:00.560 --> 37:03.440]  And then more comes out. Oh, no, it's it's taken pants off
[37:06.720 --> 37:08.720]  Says the mother drove her 30 minutes
[37:08.720 --> 37:13.120]  To his home in the woods. Let me tell you something
[37:15.120 --> 37:18.880]  I would never deliver my 14 year old daughter and I've got one
[37:20.880 --> 37:22.880]  To be alone with a
[37:22.960 --> 37:26.400]  Woman and a man if two adults said drop your daughter by
[37:27.040 --> 37:30.560]  And it was some man and woman a husband and wife. I'd say no, I'm not doing that
[37:32.160 --> 37:34.720]  If if if if if it was a
[37:34.720 --> 37:36.720]  Birthday party
[37:38.960 --> 37:43.120]  There better be a bunch of people there and of course the reports changed now they're saying he picked her up
[37:43.280 --> 37:47.360]  The point is the mother knew about it. This went on the whole thing's crazy
[37:47.360 --> 37:51.600]  And you know what it turns out so many politicians and so many people that want power
[37:52.160 --> 37:56.640]  In both political parties and in other political systems around the country and around the world
[37:58.320 --> 38:02.960]  Are into this and it's like their religion and it's how you get recruited into power
[38:02.960 --> 38:06.080]  And you don't get into a lot of these positions of power unless you're compromised
[38:06.560 --> 38:08.560]  It makes me think maybe it is true
[38:08.960 --> 38:11.840]  Again, I just don't know
[38:14.640 --> 38:16.640]  But I know this
[38:16.720 --> 38:20.800]  The media is conflating men asking women out
[38:22.160 --> 38:25.840]  Or now women asking other women out or ellen jigenerous
[38:26.640 --> 38:28.640]  at a public party
[38:28.640 --> 38:33.440]  Coming over and saying wow really like your low-cut dress
[38:33.680 --> 38:40.240]  Your adults at a party drinking ellen jigenerous comes over and hits on you. I don't like ellen jigenerous's politics
[38:40.400 --> 38:44.400]  I don't like all her anti-male stuff. I don't like all her feminist pushing. She is a hypocrite
[38:46.400 --> 38:48.880]  But if she wants to come over and admire katie parry
[38:51.760 --> 38:53.760]  Their adults they're at a party
[38:55.440 --> 38:57.360]  That's not
[38:57.360 --> 38:59.360]  That's not a crime
[39:00.080 --> 39:03.920]  But see that's what they're doing. They're turning normal adult
[39:04.720 --> 39:07.520]  promiscuous behavior. I'm not saying it's good, but it goes on
[39:08.160 --> 39:11.200]  In mammals. That's you know, that's how we procreate. It's not a crime
[39:13.200 --> 39:15.200]  And and humans are into each other
[39:19.040 --> 39:20.800]  And
[39:20.800 --> 39:22.800]  Then that becomes the crime
[39:22.800 --> 39:28.000]  With consensual adults or somebody hitting on them now ellen jigenerous would have chased her around saying come home with me tonight
[39:28.160 --> 39:33.360]  We could say she was a creeper harassing her stop it and then if she's her boss use that against her then that's a problem
[39:33.360 --> 39:35.360]  That's real sexual harassment and it's wrong
[39:36.000 --> 39:36.880]  But that's not what that is
[39:36.880 --> 39:40.000]  So they take that and then they make it like it's the same thing
[39:40.240 --> 39:43.120]  Is harvey winestein with all these 16 and 17 year old girls
[39:43.280 --> 39:48.000]  He's got coming up to his hotel rooms naked trying to make him watch him take a shower to debase him
[39:48.000 --> 39:51.280]  And then of course it just gets worse from there the rape reports and all the rest of it
[39:51.280 --> 39:55.760]  That are clearly true because there's so many examples of it over decades
[39:56.560 --> 39:58.320]  There's a history
[39:58.320 --> 40:02.320]  But are republicans always getting caught with little kids? Are they getting caught cheating on their lives?
[40:02.560 --> 40:06.000]  Are they getting caught with you know in bathrooms? They don't have sex with other men?
[40:06.880 --> 40:13.360]  Absolutely our republicans proclivities to engage in sexual escapades both legal and illegal
[40:13.920 --> 40:15.920]  Just as bad as the democrats
[40:15.920 --> 40:21.920]  I think so
[40:23.120 --> 40:25.120]  So that's where I stand on I don't know yesterday
[40:25.120 --> 40:28.960]  I saw the first reports and said oh didn't ask for sex didn't I'm like oh, okay
[40:28.960 --> 40:34.240]  Well, I said you know said to a mom daughter was pretty I hadn't then seen the other stuff that came out
[40:34.800 --> 40:40.960]  And if it's true, it just shows you how evil society is and how fallen and how broken and
[40:40.960 --> 40:43.760]  And
[40:43.760 --> 40:45.760]  It just totally confuses me because
[40:46.880 --> 40:52.320]  I just don't understand it and I don't understand people that are attracted to children
[40:56.080 --> 40:58.080]  It's I mean I would see Hugh Hefner
[40:58.880 --> 41:02.480]  85 years old with 20 year old women and it just looked gross
[41:03.200 --> 41:05.200]  It's just not normal
[41:06.240 --> 41:09.040]  I mean when I was 16 I was attracted to 16 year old girls
[41:09.680 --> 41:10.880]  but
[41:10.880 --> 41:12.880]  As I get older I get attracted to
[41:13.760 --> 41:16.640]  Women that are my age or maybe five years younger
[41:17.200 --> 41:22.320]  It's it's it's just I just don't understand it but but it's an issue of not having
[41:23.040 --> 41:30.240]  maturity being insecure and wanting power over someone who isn't as intellectual as you are who isn't developed
[41:30.720 --> 41:34.320]  That's really what this is all about and then you get deeper into it. It's about the satanism
[41:34.640 --> 41:37.600]  It's about all of it and it just gets worse and worse and worse
[41:37.600 --> 41:42.560]  And you ask yourself when does it end and again? I'm not saying this is true about more
[41:43.680 --> 41:47.200]  I'm just saying as prolific a problem as this is
[41:51.280 --> 41:56.400]  It could be true, but then boom breaking and this is the info I've been getting since last night
[41:58.960 --> 42:03.920]  Roy Moore's accuser worked for democrat leaders and has actively campaigned for Moore's opponent
[42:03.920 --> 42:08.000]  There you go ladies and gentlemen
[42:09.920 --> 42:13.520]  They had four lawsuits filed saying Donald Trump raped 14 year old girls
[42:14.000 --> 42:17.520]  Turned out they were fake names filed were none of them were even real Jane does
[42:18.400 --> 42:20.400]  but still
[42:21.440 --> 42:23.920]  It's so prolific in power structures. Who knows?
[42:25.040 --> 42:29.200]  I just know that fathers need to stand up for their daughters and their sons
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  You know, there's this thing about sons getting abused
[42:32.000 --> 42:38.000]  That it tends to get covered up because it's not seen as manly to admit your son got abused
[42:38.400 --> 42:44.000]  And that's why the the amount of boys being abused. It's estimated as much higher than the girls
[42:44.880 --> 42:50.320]  Because men are supposed to be tough and you know, just take it or or or or not talk about it
[42:52.560 --> 42:56.560]  Unbelievable. All right. I got some other huge news stay with us. We'll be back

[46:02.560 --> 46:08.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most
[46:08.080 --> 46:13.280]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system
[46:13.360 --> 46:16.160]  But right now we're dealing with massive
[46:16.800 --> 46:23.040]  Parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees
[46:23.760 --> 46:29.200]  Spreading disease around we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites
[46:29.200 --> 46:32.880]  Tell us about all this episode. There's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there
[46:32.960 --> 46:39.440]  You have the organic clove bud the organic wormwood. I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year
[46:39.440 --> 46:42.480]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today

[47:01.600 --> 47:04.240]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[47:04.240 --> 47:08.240]  Big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[47:08.960 --> 47:14.640]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios
[47:14.640 --> 47:28.820]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[47:28.820 --> 47:55.820]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones so I had a lot
[47:55.820 --> 48:00.260]  of national media text me and call me yesterday and said will you disavow
[48:00.260 --> 48:07.660]  judge Roy Moore well if they asked will you disavow David Duke in his views I'd
[48:07.660 --> 48:11.540]  say yes because we know David Duke's views and I could say I disagree with
[48:11.540 --> 48:20.020]  them but at the same time Roy Moore has not been convicted the proof is 30
[48:20.020 --> 48:25.020]  plus years old there is no proof it could be true I mean somebody could say
[48:25.020 --> 48:34.540]  that I'm an agent of Chile and not have any evidence and then people call him
[48:34.540 --> 48:40.100]  say do you disavow Alex Jones he's an agent of Brazil or an agent of Mexico
[48:40.100 --> 48:45.380]  or an agent of Canada it's just an accusation this wasn't brought out earlier
[48:45.380 --> 48:48.580]  and as I said months ago this whole Weinstein thing is going to build and
[48:48.580 --> 48:55.620]  build until then the Democrats say oh see but Republican said it to us too and
[48:55.620 --> 48:59.580]  that will give them the cover give them the wave to accuse whoever they want
[48:59.580 --> 49:04.580]  including the president turns out one of the main accusers is up on info wars
[49:04.580 --> 49:10.220]  dot com Roy Moore's accuser worked for Democrat leaders and is actually
[49:10.220 --> 49:13.980]  campaigning for Moore's opponent here it is she worked for the DNC there's
[49:13.980 --> 49:20.940]  photos of her with Hillary Clinton and she actually works for Doug Jones in the
[49:20.940 --> 49:29.940]  campaign there she is with Joe Biden so judge Roy Moore has said it is
[49:29.940 --> 49:37.300]  completely false and totally made up an absolute fictitious I mean I don't know
[49:37.300 --> 49:42.100]  judge Roy Moore he doesn't look like a pervert doesn't look like Dennis
[49:42.100 --> 49:47.900]  Taster and these guys all seem to look the same but whatever I mean I think it's
[49:47.900 --> 49:52.020]  creepy of a 35 year old guys going up to 14 year olds and it's it's underage I
[49:52.020 --> 49:56.260]  think it does starts going into pedophile territory under about 13
[49:56.260 --> 50:03.220]  you're definitely a pedophile I think the age of consensus day right where it
[50:03.220 --> 50:08.180]  is it's 17 18 years old but but you notice they throw the book at people who
[50:08.180 --> 50:16.100]  are like 18 and have a 14 15 year old girlfriend that's not statutory rate but
[50:16.100 --> 50:23.900]  again they go after the stuff that really isn't abusive and then they just
[50:23.900 --> 50:28.660]  leave the wide open really hardcore stuff alone it's sick but that's starting
[50:28.660 --> 50:36.420]  to change ladies and gentlemen and I just want to ask why didn't these mothers
[50:36.420 --> 50:42.380]  and people that are saying things why didn't they say something 35 years ago
[50:42.380 --> 50:46.500]  and by the way if they can produce a police report or something or some
[50:46.500 --> 50:50.180]  evidence then I'm gonna say okay looks like Roy Moore bad guy he needs to step
[50:50.180 --> 50:56.420]  down but are you gonna hold your breath ladies and gentlemen because they did
[50:56.420 --> 50:59.580]  the same thing to Trump and I'm gonna get the same calls are you disavow the
[50:59.580 --> 51:05.460]  candidate Trump and I'd say okay it's Jane Doe in New York let's see some
[51:05.460 --> 51:09.820]  evidence and that was totally fake in Houston and in New York and it was all
[51:09.820 --> 51:13.380]  fake stories about him and Epstein who've never been alone together they've
[51:13.380 --> 51:16.340]  been some parties before you got the Clintons on the planes you've got
[51:16.340 --> 51:20.340]  wine see on the planes Kevin Spacey and notice with them you've got rape cases
[51:20.340 --> 51:27.020]  settled you notice with them you you've got where there's smoke there's fire but
[51:27.020 --> 51:32.740]  could more be guilty absolutely these problems are prolific but I don't think
[51:32.740 --> 51:36.860]  so the evidence is important that direction this stinks now of political
[51:36.860 --> 51:40.340]  manipulations now mainstream media because I don't just pick a talking
[51:40.340 --> 51:44.740]  point and go with it I I go where the evidence leads they may say Jones is all
[51:44.740 --> 51:47.980]  over the map you know first he says no evidence then he says there could be
[51:47.980 --> 51:52.780]  evidence and then he says well it's not a strong case because we are learning
[51:52.780 --> 51:59.580]  more as things go on but that's the semantical games they play but do we
[51:59.580 --> 52:05.420]  catch judges and Republicans and people doing bad things yeah in fact you find
[52:05.420 --> 52:09.820]  an overabundance in places of power people like that because they're
[52:09.820 --> 52:14.820]  seeking power and people that want power a certain percentage of them want
[52:14.820 --> 52:22.940]  children it's the disgusting caviar that that that welds the whole evil
[52:22.940 --> 52:30.380]  saying together so I want to expose it I've known Charlie Sheen for like 12
[52:30.380 --> 52:37.220]  years stay at his house probably 13 14 15 times when I go out to LA do something
[52:37.220 --> 52:42.140]  I'd go go by see him say they're not or to never saw any sex any impropriety he
[52:42.140 --> 52:46.100]  was always married with the wife he was with until he asked me to come out there
[52:46.100 --> 52:49.380]  and help him stay sober when he'd gotten on drugs I went out there and there were
[52:49.380 --> 52:53.180]  few wild girls and stuff there and I said man I'm out here bro it's a bad vibe
[52:53.180 --> 52:56.820]  here you need to you need to you know check yourself in he said oh I'm I'm
[52:56.820 --> 53:03.220]  off drugs but never saw any gay proclivities nothing about children but
[53:03.220 --> 53:07.580]  you now hear the story about a guy dad again for over a decade stuff that
[53:07.580 --> 53:14.300]  happened reportedly 30 years ago and people say do you disavow Charlie Sheen
[53:14.300 --> 53:18.700]  I have said that when I knew him he was sober and off drugs just smoke cigarettes
[53:18.700 --> 53:22.020]  and drink coffee he was a smart guy trying to be politically involved trying
[53:22.020 --> 53:26.940]  to be a good guy but now Denise Richards you know has come out and said well she
[53:26.940 --> 53:31.300]  saw videos on his computer of what looked like young men or women and I'm
[53:31.300 --> 53:36.980]  like okay Denise if he really did this and maybe he did why did you bring it
[53:36.980 --> 53:41.660]  all out only after you've gotten 20 30 million dollars or whatever it is in
[53:41.660 --> 53:46.180]  alimony I mean you need to bring it out when it's happening if you've seen it
[53:46.180 --> 53:49.940]  but if it is the case of Charlie Sheen's one more evil casualty of that
[53:49.940 --> 53:53.020]  whole six system it's Hollywood so I've said Hollywood's totally out of control
[53:53.020 --> 54:00.020]  totally corrupt totally evil a rotting stinking cesspool but then there's the
[54:00.020 --> 54:03.300]  same response Jones you need to respond to the Charlie Sheen thing I've already
[54:03.300 --> 54:07.220]  done it three times you Jones you talk about the Federal Reserve I didn't talk
[54:07.220 --> 54:12.580]  about it today it's the same thing over and over again now speaking of hoaxes
[54:12.580 --> 54:18.820]  CNN has had to admit that the old Air Force thing was a hoax they don't want
[54:18.820 --> 54:23.340]  to tell you specifically who was the hoaxers putting the n-word on the
[54:23.340 --> 54:27.740]  vending machine ladies and gentlemen when I said it was probably a hoax it was
[54:27.740 --> 54:32.340]  because I saw the big PR rollout the way it came out was so slickly done show
[54:32.340 --> 54:37.420]  quick to coincide with the whole NFL thing and plus 99% of the cross
[54:37.420 --> 54:42.500]  burnings and poop swastikas and all the rest of this stuff they end up finding
[54:42.500 --> 54:50.140]  out it's somebody wanting attention it's a fact so if 99 times out of 100 it's
[54:50.140 --> 55:02.980]  fake if 99 times out of 100 it's fake why would it be fake again and you know if
[55:02.980 --> 55:08.740]  I had to find somebody I'd say I'd investigate that general he's the one
[55:08.740 --> 55:11.460]  running the show he's the one grandstanding he's the one as a political
[55:11.460 --> 55:15.500]  and anti-trump guy I'm not saying he did but you know what I said it was staged
[55:15.500 --> 55:19.340]  and now we know it staged and you know what I think somebody put somebody up
[55:19.340 --> 55:23.420]  to that is either SJW or or somebody under that general we know somebody
[55:23.420 --> 55:29.100]  staged it to further divide America and have the military brass run psyops all
[55:29.100 --> 55:34.540]  over national television and assault us with propaganda but the Air Force
[55:34.540 --> 55:39.220]  Academy hate crime hope teaches us about mainstream media and race and all of the

[59:55.660 --> 1:00:24.740]  well I told you at the time a month ago because of the timing and because of
[1:00:24.740 --> 1:00:30.860]  the scripting I saw and because of the past history of 99% literally of hate
[1:00:30.860 --> 1:00:37.300]  crimes being hoaxes the burning crosses the poop swastikas I mean it's just an
[1:00:37.300 --> 1:00:42.460]  epidemic of attention-seeking and how the psychological bullies beat
[1:00:42.460 --> 1:00:47.740]  everybody over the head you've got this SJW Air Force general who's a big
[1:00:47.740 --> 1:00:52.820]  anti-trumper and his whole group of liberal cohorts wanted to terrorize the
[1:00:52.820 --> 1:00:58.020]  air force and terrorize the cadet school that was also based there and so they
[1:00:58.020 --> 1:01:05.940]  posted go home inward on the vending machine and in other areas and of course
[1:01:05.940 --> 1:01:09.940]  it's fake so they could beat everybody over the head just like all the NFL
[1:01:09.940 --> 1:01:14.700]  crud and the rest of it this is how they go to war against America it's how they
[1:01:14.700 --> 1:01:20.900]  divide everybody and don't you know CNN hated having to eat crow with this
[1:01:20.900 --> 1:01:27.980]  statement that unfortunately it was fake oh unfortunately there wasn't enough
[1:01:27.980 --> 1:01:32.860]  racism for you to make up or for you to fan the flames of all the knockout games
[1:01:32.860 --> 1:01:37.820]  white people are dying every day from knockout games you their reports every
[1:01:37.820 --> 1:01:43.780]  couple days of people dying people almost dying every day to be clear but
[1:01:43.780 --> 1:01:49.820]  four or five deaths a week and they're almost all old white people and it's
[1:01:49.820 --> 1:01:53.340]  black folks going over because they're white they deserve it and punching them
[1:01:53.340 --> 1:01:58.180]  and then they hit their head and they die and then the media plays dumb and
[1:01:58.180 --> 1:02:01.340]  there's all these cops getting killed and all the rest of it that's racially
[1:02:01.340 --> 1:02:07.780]  motivated because the media has hyped up some racist black folks like the new
[1:02:07.780 --> 1:02:10.740]  black Panther Party down in Houston says go out and kill white people go out and
[1:02:10.740 --> 1:02:18.220]  loot them don't rob your neighborhood go kill them and it's sick but then you've
[1:02:18.220 --> 1:02:23.540]  got these people at the Air Force and the SJW
[1:02:23.700 --> 1:02:28.420]  shitting there with all the fake indignance and all the fake gravitas
[1:02:28.420 --> 1:02:34.260]  that the general had to hear all a bunch of trash we're gonna find out who did
[1:02:34.260 --> 1:02:40.220]  this you're all under scrutiny except them the ones that did it here it is
[1:02:40.220 --> 1:02:44.180]  ladies and gentlemen a stunning update today on a story we covered in late
[1:02:44.180 --> 1:02:47.780]  September it was a speech heard all around the world viewed more than a
[1:02:47.780 --> 1:02:52.260]  million times on social media lieutenant general J. Silveria received high
[1:02:52.260 --> 1:02:56.020]  praise for telling groom full of cadets that racial slurs will not be
[1:02:56.020 --> 1:03:00.740]  tolerated at the Air Force Academy the general was responding to racial
[1:03:00.740 --> 1:03:06.500]  epithets including the inward scribbled on these message boards on the doors of
[1:03:06.500 --> 1:03:11.500]  five black cadets at the prep school and I talked to him the day after his
[1:03:11.500 --> 1:03:16.340]  speech was was really praised all around and this is what he told me then
[1:03:16.340 --> 1:03:22.900]  about that teachable moment so I needed to address the topic head-on but it's
[1:03:22.900 --> 1:03:27.260]  also about also about teaching them about addressing the type listen so I
[1:03:27.260 --> 1:03:31.540]  wanted to be unambiguous about how we're gonna treat this topic but it but
[1:03:31.540 --> 1:03:36.940]  everything this is the religion see they take all your rights away to also give
[1:03:36.940 --> 1:03:41.100]  them and then turn you into a scramble-brained idiot after a month long
[1:03:41.100 --> 1:03:46.300]  investigation officials at the school now say it was all a hoax perpetrated
[1:03:46.300 --> 1:03:51.620]  by one of the black students so he stands by his message and thinks it's a
[1:03:51.620 --> 1:03:54.620]  powerful message that should be understood by all airmen both at the
[1:03:54.620 --> 1:03:59.300]  academy and wider well he's right the speech still stands the words ring true
[1:03:59.300 --> 1:04:06.220]  it's just unfortunate to learn who really all the way around who was also on
[1:04:06.220 --> 1:04:10.260]  vending machines was the first report I saw but also on the doors and of course
[1:04:10.260 --> 1:04:17.500]  they're saying it's it's the black cadet but not naming anything my gut tells
[1:04:17.500 --> 1:04:21.780]  me just like I told you it was fake and the timing and all the rest of it that
[1:04:21.780 --> 1:04:26.060]  it was staged or it was a copycat as well the NFL hyping and the cavernic
[1:04:26.060 --> 1:04:31.420]  garbage either way it's as phony has a three dollar bill and we are right again
[1:04:31.420 --> 1:04:38.420]  info wars get next month's news today in the case of that but in the case of

[1:06:15.460 --> 1:06:26.460]  coming up at the bottom of the hour the former president of Facebook admits the
[1:06:26.460 --> 1:06:31.620]  plan is to dehumanize you make you depressed and totally control you and
[1:06:31.620 --> 1:06:35.700]  also have their own internal documents admitting it this is key information and
[1:06:35.700 --> 1:06:41.220]  it ties in with all the big pushes to microchip troops not just for PTSD but
[1:06:41.220 --> 1:06:47.620]  part of signing up as Sweden moves to make folks that are going to be
[1:06:47.620 --> 1:06:53.420]  traveling on the trains and buses take microchips and USA Today says you will
[1:06:53.420 --> 1:06:58.420]  take it ABC News says you will take it imagine I told you 20 years ago they
[1:06:58.420 --> 1:07:02.740]  were gonna try to make it mandatory think the Bible told us 2,000 years ago the
[1:07:02.740 --> 1:07:11.100]  Bible get today's news 2,000 years early so a lot going on it's coming out that
[1:07:11.100 --> 1:07:16.220]  at least one of the Roy Moore accusers works directly for Hillary and for Jones
[1:07:16.220 --> 1:07:22.100]  who is the Democrat candidate for Senate there this this this this this this
[1:07:22.100 --> 1:07:26.180]  wreaks as a political hit job of the Republican establishment trying to hold
[1:07:26.180 --> 1:07:32.780]  on to power going after them as well but I wanted to get Dr. Steve Pachanik on we
[1:07:32.780 --> 1:07:35.340]  have been able to have him on as much as the hurricane devastated Florida he's
[1:07:35.340 --> 1:07:42.180]  been working on that but now he's joining us to get into what's happening
[1:07:42.180 --> 1:07:46.580]  currently in the world what he sees happening in Korea what he sees happening
[1:07:46.580 --> 1:07:51.540]  in the Middle East what he sees with the different policies of Trump but I
[1:07:51.540 --> 1:07:56.300]  got to say this he was on I guess about a month ago and I was talking about how
[1:07:56.300 --> 1:08:04.700]  the generals and general Kelly namely Chief of Staff were in the news blocking
[1:08:04.700 --> 1:08:09.260]  all info wars and Breitbart news getting to the president's desk but it was also
[1:08:09.260 --> 1:08:14.020]  other news as well and that I was really upset about that and you know he made the
[1:08:14.020 --> 1:08:17.820]  point that well well you got 70 employees the president's got thousands and if I
[1:08:17.820 --> 1:08:20.020]  need to talk to you I just have to call one of your crew members you know not
[1:08:20.020 --> 1:08:23.940]  just you because you're busy and I understand that and I understand they
[1:08:23.940 --> 1:08:29.380]  had leaks but now in hindsight Kelly has gotten a lot better actually on a lot
[1:08:29.380 --> 1:08:34.180]  of policies and Trump has actually gotten more effective in some ways so I
[1:08:34.180 --> 1:08:39.140]  think the truth that the proof is in the pudding but larger than that I've set up
[1:08:39.140 --> 1:08:43.180]  when I'm doing in Austin Texas people say why Austin is my family's from here
[1:08:43.180 --> 1:08:48.140]  you know before California invaded and I've got my own operation I'm trying to
[1:08:48.140 --> 1:08:51.620]  change the world from kind of out here in the wilderness and we've been
[1:08:51.620 --> 1:08:55.740]  effective not in the swamp I don't want to be part of the camp followers I don't
[1:08:55.740 --> 1:08:59.740]  want to be in the swamp I don't care who's who's got the presence here Jared
[1:08:59.740 --> 1:09:05.360]  Kushner or Stephen Bannon or any of this I've had plenty of chances to go have
[1:09:05.360 --> 1:09:10.980]  meetings all these big waves and stuff I haven't done it because it's just kind
[1:09:10.980 --> 1:09:14.420]  of sycophantic in a way of course you get a lot of big inside stories and
[1:09:14.420 --> 1:09:19.100]  things like that so when I've been upset at Kushner or I've been upset at Bannon
[1:09:19.100 --> 1:09:23.060]  or I've been upset it it's about policies and ideas or Kelly for that
[1:09:23.060 --> 1:09:27.740]  matter but I'm not in the cult of DC I'm not trying to be part of it I'm not
[1:09:27.740 --> 1:09:33.060]  trying to swim around in it when I go after somebody it's because I'm upset
[1:09:33.060 --> 1:09:37.100]  about policies and I want them to know I'm upset the American people are upset
[1:09:37.100 --> 1:09:42.380]  it's not so I get a seat at their feted table I I want Trump in there to
[1:09:42.380 --> 1:09:46.060]  dynamite the DC system and try to restore our republic and kick some of
[1:09:46.060 --> 1:09:50.940]  these arrogant people out but that said the chenic has said that he thinks Kelly
[1:09:50.940 --> 1:09:56.380]  is a pretty good guy and I think so far there's been some propaganda out there
[1:09:56.380 --> 1:10:01.860]  by people that do really want their lobbying organizations in the White
[1:10:01.860 --> 1:10:06.020]  House and so it's internal power struggles and then some of the things
[1:10:06.020 --> 1:10:09.900]  going on in the White House get exaggerated really in power struggles and
[1:10:09.900 --> 1:10:14.700]  I just want to signal and telegraph I'm not part of DC or Capitol Hill or
[1:10:14.700 --> 1:10:23.340]  White House power struggles it's like when Fox News years ago did a New York
[1:10:23.340 --> 1:10:26.380]  Daily News interview and said Alex Jones tried to get a job with us but we
[1:10:26.380 --> 1:10:34.980]  refused him an unnamed vice president said I refused three shows with Fox they
[1:10:34.980 --> 1:10:40.580]  wanted me to fly there every Friday tape shows on Saturday that were there
[1:10:40.580 --> 1:10:48.220]  Sunday no way no way just out of hand I have a family I am so proud that I
[1:10:48.220 --> 1:10:52.540]  refuse the big radio network deals and and I did all the other stuff and the
[1:10:52.540 --> 1:10:58.140]  TV show deals that's that's really what I'm why what I'm proud of so I just want
[1:10:58.140 --> 1:11:03.200]  to telegraph that to everybody I built my operation myself didn't do it with
[1:11:03.200 --> 1:11:08.340]  daddy's money didn't do it like Kushner which more power to you bro I'm not
[1:11:08.340 --> 1:11:13.980]  trying to be at the trough okay I don't want to hang around in New York I don't
[1:11:13.980 --> 1:11:17.700]  want to hang around in DC horrible vibes I don't I want to be out in the hill
[1:11:17.700 --> 1:11:20.900]  country away from everybody so understand I don't want to be in your
[1:11:20.900 --> 1:11:24.380]  club I don't want to be in any intelligence agencies I don't want to be
[1:11:24.380 --> 1:11:28.260]  understand I wouldn't join any organization that would have me
[1:11:28.260 --> 1:11:33.460]  understand so I want to just telegraph that clearly to everybody I'm self-made
[1:11:33.460 --> 1:11:38.540]  and I'm proud of that and I'm a maverick and that's the way it is and I piss on
[1:11:38.540 --> 1:11:45.820]  Hollywood and I piss on DC and I piss on all of it it's disgusting it's like
[1:11:45.820 --> 1:11:50.900]  some ugly disease snaggletooth pus filled woman with 14 diseases telling
[1:11:50.900 --> 1:11:56.420]  people I want to have sex with them it's a damn lie excuse me there you go I'm
[1:11:56.420 --> 1:12:00.420]  gonna be a good boy here anyways let's get Dr. Steve Pachinicon because you
[1:12:00.420 --> 1:12:06.220]  know he had to say he got real mad when I was criticizing Kelly saying that it
[1:12:06.220 --> 1:12:09.780]  was just all internal fighting garbage and so far he's been proven about 80%
[1:12:09.780 --> 1:12:13.380]  right we'll see what happens is Kelly's getting better and better about stuff I
[1:12:13.380 --> 1:12:16.420]  think what I've been told is kind of woken up to what's going on and has
[1:12:16.420 --> 1:12:20.220]  gotten more hardcore maybe he got his sea legs but only into all this was
[1:12:20.220 --> 1:12:26.100]  Dr. Pachinicon also congressman from Florida Gates says that basically they're
[1:12:26.100 --> 1:12:29.420]  trying to cool against the president and shopping a coup against the president
[1:12:29.420 --> 1:12:34.260]  up there on Capitol Hill we'll play that clip coming up so doc there's a big
[1:12:34.260 --> 1:12:40.020]  waterfront to cover here but what should we tackle first well first of all thank
[1:12:40.020 --> 1:12:44.460]  you for having me on but you and I disagree and we'll always be friends the
[1:12:44.460 --> 1:12:51.420]  real big issue and why I can't go on the internet is I'm being hacked like you I
[1:12:51.420 --> 1:12:57.180]  do I'm being hacked Google he monetized me and I the Israelis and some
[1:12:57.180 --> 1:13:01.580]  Americans understand what I'm about to tell you and they're not happy about it
[1:13:01.580 --> 1:13:05.420]  what I'm about to say and I'm cutting to the chase is that there's going to be a
[1:13:05.420 --> 1:13:11.580]  war and Lebanon between Hezbollah and the Israeli army I predicted it months
[1:13:11.580 --> 1:13:17.180]  ago unfortunately it's coming true once again that incompetent young man from
[1:13:17.180 --> 1:13:22.300]  the White House Jared Kushner went over to Saudi Arabia talked to another
[1:13:22.300 --> 1:13:27.140]  incompetent young man named Mohammed Bed Salman who's never been in the army
[1:13:27.140 --> 1:13:32.780]  created a war two years ago with lemon against the Houthi and because Saudi
[1:13:32.780 --> 1:13:39.980]  Arabia surrounded by Shiites and Iran and they lost and because three weeks ago I
[1:13:39.980 --> 1:13:46.500]  couldn't even announce on your show that Syria what beat our troops and beat
[1:13:46.500 --> 1:13:51.220]  ISIS and so what's happening is there's a lot of distraction going on the
[1:13:51.220 --> 1:13:56.900]  domestic side in order for you and me to avoid what the real issue is and that is
[1:13:56.900 --> 1:14:02.140]  Lebanon will be put into play and once again Israel will probably attack
[1:14:02.140 --> 1:14:06.660]  Hezbollah while the head of Hezbollah whom I have known about and I've worked
[1:14:06.660 --> 1:14:11.860]  against Hezbollah and I worked with Hezbollah it's gonna fight the Israeli
[1:14:11.860 --> 1:14:16.420]  army and this is what they want don't want me to say to you that's why I can't
[1:14:16.420 --> 1:14:20.820]  go on the internet that's why they won't allow me to publish a lot of things but
[1:14:20.820 --> 1:14:25.820]  they clearly signal that they're gonna war with Iran let me be clear and I'm
[1:14:25.820 --> 1:14:31.260]  glad we got you on they're like picking people up that are guest on the show now
[1:14:31.260 --> 1:14:35.220]  the FBI is and I know you've been called in to federal court as well about the
[1:14:35.220 --> 1:14:40.300]  show but this is getting serious yes that's correct the FBI and I do not get
[1:14:40.300 --> 1:14:45.220]  along because from the very day that I had a deal with the FBI and the Hanafi
[1:14:45.220 --> 1:14:50.380]  Muslim episode where 150 hostages would take in house in three different
[1:14:50.380 --> 1:14:56.340]  buildings FBI nested up so badly that I was brought in I was sworn in by the
[1:14:56.340 --> 1:15:01.860]  prosecutor Earl Silver I took it over and then I said to the FBI you could you
[1:15:01.860 --> 1:15:06.020]  had a bed behavioral profile you didn't know what you're doing you couldn't
[1:15:06.020 --> 1:15:10.620]  repel from the helicopters you were not any good you're incompetent since that
[1:15:10.620 --> 1:15:15.460]  day they know exactly how I feel about them I've said you were created by a
[1:15:15.460 --> 1:15:20.740]  cross-dresser who was a manipulator and a sick individual and it continued through
[1:15:20.740 --> 1:15:25.940]  Mueller and the 9-11 issue and the FBI got pissed because I said you're
[1:15:25.940 --> 1:15:30.820]  incompetent not mentioning this is important let's get into the civil war
[1:15:30.820 --> 1:15:34.980]  and Islam and all the different factions and the Sunnis and the Shiites and
[1:15:34.980 --> 1:15:38.660]  what's really happening in Saudi Arabia because that is the real reason we got
[1:15:38.660 --> 1:15:43.300]  you on what's happening in Saudi Arabia is it spilling over into America because
[1:15:43.300 --> 1:15:48.500]  that's the info I have is that Vegas and and other events are spillovers of this
[1:15:48.500 --> 1:15:53.460]  whole Saudi situation will be right back with Dr. Steve Pacinic on the coming
[1:15:53.460 --> 1:15:58.260]  war he says it's about to take place Katie armor has been on a mission to

[1:20:32.260 --> 1:20:35.060]  Saudi Arabia trump goes over there to make deals
[1:20:35.060 --> 1:20:38.340]  you got cushion running around the middle of it
[1:20:38.340 --> 1:20:43.220]  and all i want is stability and peace but let's talk about from dr. c pochinic
[1:20:43.220 --> 1:20:45.380]  sources and of course he's worked for different
[1:20:45.380 --> 1:20:49.300]  agencies in the state department and uh best-selling author with tom clancy and
[1:20:49.300 --> 1:20:52.260]  a lot of the things under his belt he's given us a lot of good information over
[1:20:52.260 --> 1:20:55.460]  the years what's currently happening i mean they're
[1:20:55.460 --> 1:20:58.660]  admitting that there's about to be a new war in the middle east
[1:20:58.660 --> 1:21:01.940]  and that all these machinations are going on
[1:21:01.940 --> 1:21:05.940]  and that we see a lot of the older line globalist connections
[1:21:05.940 --> 1:21:11.140]  kind of being severed but we see them trying to modernize in some ways i mean
[1:21:11.140 --> 1:21:15.300]  what are the positive areas about the new people in charge
[1:21:15.300 --> 1:21:19.620]  and then what's negative and and what's really behind the helicopters blowing up
[1:21:19.620 --> 1:21:23.780]  and the fire fights and i mean reducing this down
[1:21:23.780 --> 1:21:27.060]  what's currently happening in the middle east that that they don't want in our
[1:21:27.060 --> 1:21:30.900]  news that's right what they don't want in the news
[1:21:30.900 --> 1:21:34.500]  the fact number one we lost the war in
[1:21:34.500 --> 1:21:38.260]  syria we had spent trillions of dollars obama had
[1:21:38.260 --> 1:21:43.380]  send over 500 billion of our moderate you know
[1:21:43.380 --> 1:21:47.060]  terrorist it was a total nonsense created by the ski a
[1:21:47.060 --> 1:21:51.220]  panetta patras and all the nonsense in the war in syria
[1:21:51.220 --> 1:21:56.500]  syria eventually won that means russia i ran in syria with the dominant powers
[1:21:56.500 --> 1:22:02.420]  turkey sardar arabia and israel lost in turn what they're doing right now is
[1:22:02.420 --> 1:22:07.860]  that the young prince who's really incompetent and started a war in yemen
[1:22:07.860 --> 1:22:11.140]  against iranians like us supporting the houthi
[1:22:11.140 --> 1:22:16.980]  his name is mohammed someone who used that but the key person here is a name
[1:22:16.980 --> 1:22:22.580]  called harari i knew his father he's the son but he's the president of lebanon
[1:22:22.580 --> 1:22:25.860]  the harari family was always beholden to sardar arabia
[1:22:25.860 --> 1:22:30.180]  so the young prince called him back to sardar arabia because
[1:22:30.180 --> 1:22:33.780]  harari has a lebanese passport and a sardar passport
[1:22:33.780 --> 1:22:39.300]  but it's a very bad sign for harari to remain in sardar arabia because
[1:22:39.300 --> 1:22:43.620]  basically he's held hostage what that means in effect is that
[1:22:43.620 --> 1:22:49.780]  sardar arabian israel wants to designate all of lebanon as islah
[1:22:49.780 --> 1:22:53.380]  uh and in power country and that's not true
[1:22:53.380 --> 1:22:57.620]  you have phalanges you have shiites you have sunni you have jews it's a very
[1:22:57.620 --> 1:23:02.020]  complicated area when the syrians were in there they were able to maintain
[1:23:02.020 --> 1:23:06.420]  peace but now sardar arabia is surrounded by syria
[1:23:06.420 --> 1:23:13.140]  which they lost to iran you have a rack where we lost it to iran
[1:23:13.140 --> 1:23:17.460]  sardar arabia i understand if you look at this geopolitically under
[1:23:17.460 --> 1:23:20.740]  under obama and what's happened the last eight years
[1:23:20.740 --> 1:23:25.300]  we have absolutely lost the middle east but some would argue that was a
[1:23:25.300 --> 1:23:28.500]  strategy of destabilization and globalist
[1:23:28.500 --> 1:23:32.580]  selling out the united states because you and i were talking eight nine years
[1:23:32.580 --> 1:23:36.580]  ago about how this was destroying you know u.s dominance and also putting
[1:23:36.580 --> 1:23:39.700]  bad people in charge so how can we see what's happening
[1:23:39.700 --> 1:23:42.740]  and then just say they're incompetent i mean this was done on purpose they
[1:23:42.740 --> 1:23:47.380]  funded the era of spring correct correct well we're not because we're not
[1:23:47.380 --> 1:23:50.900]  putting in jail the viewers the ellery clinton's
[1:23:50.900 --> 1:23:55.460]  the warmongers the people in the sea so so what's about to happen
[1:23:55.460 --> 1:23:58.900]  as this war escalates happened now is what but the
[1:23:58.900 --> 1:24:02.500]  even at tanyana was just been indicted he
[1:24:02.500 --> 1:24:07.700]  is a wife all of his friends all of his cabinet has been indicted by the israeli
[1:24:07.700 --> 1:24:11.540]  judicial system basically saying you're so corrupt
[1:24:11.540 --> 1:24:16.340]  you've got internal problems in israel you got internal problems in sardar
[1:24:16.340 --> 1:24:19.540]  arabia and lebanon what israel is going to do
[1:24:19.540 --> 1:24:23.940]  is attack with the commission of america because for the first time we
[1:24:23.940 --> 1:24:27.940]  announced that nobody's heard it a full time base
[1:24:27.940 --> 1:24:32.580]  in israel with american weapons meaning we have missile systems and
[1:24:32.580 --> 1:24:36.820]  airplanes here we never had that before and we kept that quiet
[1:24:36.820 --> 1:24:40.420]  but for the first time it was never covered in the newspapers we
[1:24:40.420 --> 1:24:45.620]  publicly announced we are with israel and we will fight whoever is real fight
[1:24:45.620 --> 1:24:49.940]  now israel forgets that in 2006 db again
[1:24:49.940 --> 1:24:55.860]  incompetently went into southern lebanon to attack his blood and he failed
[1:24:55.860 --> 1:24:59.060]  it was a war that was supposed to take over for three days
[1:24:59.060 --> 1:25:03.540]  i found out sure hezbollah was dug in and had light any tank weapons and it
[1:25:03.540 --> 1:25:07.460]  took out there exactly and they took out the equivalent of what
[1:25:07.460 --> 1:25:12.580]  we consider in america at a 30 to one ratio another one every israeli soldier
[1:25:12.580 --> 1:25:18.900]  is the equivalent of 30 americans in number they took out about 35 000 dead
[1:25:18.900 --> 1:25:24.420]  israeli soldier in equivalent numbers and it was a failure and once again bb's
[1:25:24.420 --> 1:25:27.700]  going to go in there and the israeli government's going to
[1:25:27.700 --> 1:25:31.300]  remobilize the idf and they will fail again
[1:25:31.300 --> 1:25:36.180]  this time hezbollah is fully fully armed and more importantly
[1:25:36.180 --> 1:25:41.300]  that the hezbollah fighters are part of the lebanese army they're no longer
[1:25:41.300 --> 1:25:44.500]  terror it's nonsense it's citizen well the bigger
[1:25:44.500 --> 1:25:47.780]  issue is now as you said those corridors have been open now
[1:25:47.780 --> 1:25:52.420]  with the ongoing wars in that area and so the iranians have brought in their
[1:25:52.420 --> 1:25:55.540]  revolutionary guard and heavier weapons
[1:25:55.540 --> 1:26:01.300]  reportedly so this could get really really bad fast nasty and and and it's
[1:26:01.300 --> 1:26:06.340]  not only going to get nasty it has no legitimacy on our part we had no
[1:26:06.340 --> 1:26:10.740]  national security interest in the middle east with regard to iran
[1:26:10.740 --> 1:26:14.340]  iran has done nothing to it let me ask you this who do you
[1:26:14.340 --> 1:26:18.980]  think's advising you really think trump is listening to kushner
[1:26:18.980 --> 1:26:22.580]  yes no question about it well i've learned i've learned
[1:26:22.580 --> 1:26:26.180]  no in the last couple months trumps really turned on kushner and uh again i
[1:26:26.180 --> 1:26:29.220]  don't even get in the middle of this i don't even like knowing this stuff
[1:26:29.220 --> 1:26:32.340]  but but it you see it in the news now but i knew months ago
[1:26:32.340 --> 1:26:37.940]  that trump is very angry at kushner uh over maybe he may be i have no
[1:26:37.940 --> 1:26:42.020]  problems about that but what i'm saying to you and you're right on many things
[1:26:42.020 --> 1:26:45.780]  but roger stone said this well into two months ago
[1:26:45.780 --> 1:26:50.340]  that there would be an impending war in the middle east he never elaborated
[1:26:50.340 --> 1:26:53.860]  now what i'm saying when i came back on number one
[1:26:53.860 --> 1:26:57.700]  they want to make sure i don't get on the internet of video this is not by
[1:26:57.700 --> 1:27:01.620]  accident this all happened in 10 no i understand well let me ask you this
[1:27:01.620 --> 1:27:04.420]  we'll come back the next thing we can talk about whatever you want
[1:27:04.420 --> 1:27:08.580]  what do you make a blowback and information on vegas
[1:27:08.580 --> 1:27:12.420]  and these and this and this this mental patient tried to kill his command
[1:27:12.420 --> 1:27:16.100]  they put him in a mental institution he escapes they don't file the paperwork
[1:27:16.100 --> 1:27:20.580]  that he's uh not allowed to own a firearm i mean this whole thing smells
[1:27:20.580 --> 1:27:25.460]  yeah but this is where you and i make sure it again has the
[1:27:25.460 --> 1:27:29.940]  footprints and the heavy footprints of the fbi all over it
[1:27:29.940 --> 1:27:36.020]  because every time you look at one of their profiles it's the same dynamic
[1:27:36.020 --> 1:27:41.300]  with fandy hook the guy was mentally ill he escaped and then they blow up the
[1:27:41.300 --> 1:27:44.020]  building and make sure there's nothing left this is the
[1:27:44.020 --> 1:27:48.020]  incompetency of what i consider to be a sassy
[1:27:48.020 --> 1:27:52.420]  sure what do you make of the sandy hook adam lanza documents the fbi released
[1:27:52.420 --> 1:27:57.140]  it's nonsense they had to overcome what i was saying and you were saying
[1:27:57.140 --> 1:28:00.180]  because i knew very well that the psychiatrist who may
[1:28:00.180 --> 1:28:05.140]  hired at Yale was it was just paid i don't know but it's in the new documents
[1:28:05.140 --> 1:28:09.380]  that lanza was working with the cia oh no it's nonsense
[1:28:09.380 --> 1:28:12.900]  the whole thing was nonsense and what it shows to you is that we're waiting
[1:28:12.900 --> 1:28:17.460]  are you saying the fbi stuck that in there are you saying the fbi stuck
[1:28:17.460 --> 1:28:20.980]  you understand the new the the documents the fbi release they say lanza was
[1:28:20.980 --> 1:28:24.260]  visited by the cia and recruited by him is that the fbi
[1:28:24.260 --> 1:28:28.820]  sticking that in there to go after the cia fbi has it let me put it this way the
[1:28:28.820 --> 1:28:32.260]  fbi is a totally corrupt dysfunctional
[1:28:32.260 --> 1:28:35.780]  organization created by a cross wrestler
[1:28:35.780 --> 1:28:40.180]  homosexual who tried to manipulate presidents who i worked with
[1:28:40.180 --> 1:28:46.740]  and was detested by nixon by many others in the system what the fbi is now is
[1:28:46.740 --> 1:28:51.060]  that this functional organization has personified last night
[1:28:51.060 --> 1:28:54.500]  where the head of county terrorism was found drunk
[1:28:54.500 --> 1:28:57.300]  let's talk about that let's talk about mule that's a no-brainer a big

[1:33:20.420 --> 1:33:45.220]  he is alex jones
[1:33:50.980 --> 1:33:58.020]  i want to get into the texas shooting i want to get into what happened in
[1:33:58.020 --> 1:34:02.900]  vegas i want to get into the fbi and muller
[1:34:02.900 --> 1:34:08.900]  who is passed his eyeballs in russian collusion and so that's why that he
[1:34:08.900 --> 1:34:12.740]  went after trump and myself and everybody else
[1:34:12.740 --> 1:34:16.420]  saying that we're russian agents and they have just hundreds of articles this
[1:34:16.420 --> 1:34:19.700]  week just saying it's confirmed jones works for
[1:34:19.700 --> 1:34:22.020]  the russians
[1:34:23.140 --> 1:34:26.820]  and it's just beyond bizarre to see them accuse
[1:34:26.820 --> 1:34:34.020]  ran poll took carlson and then meanwhile muller is on tar max
[1:34:34.020 --> 1:34:39.300]  giving weapons grade uranium to the fsb that's the kgb
[1:34:39.300 --> 1:34:44.500]  and the bag man and killing investigations into the
[1:34:44.500 --> 1:34:50.740]  clinton's and then appointing people like phil mud who was with the cia to the
[1:34:50.740 --> 1:34:56.900]  fbi to go on television and say we're going to kill the president
[1:34:57.460 --> 1:35:00.660]  you don't see people in third world countries doing that it's beyond banana
[1:35:00.660 --> 1:35:04.420]  republic and then muller walks around and i'm surprised they don't blow horns
[1:35:04.420 --> 1:35:07.940]  and go
[1:35:07.940 --> 1:35:15.460]  royal king is here unelected master appointed by the deputy general
[1:35:15.460 --> 1:35:21.300]  the man who will decide who can be president and who will veto the voters
[1:35:21.300 --> 1:35:29.300]  robert in bed with russia muller
[1:35:29.300 --> 1:35:33.300]  and i'm like is this really happening
[1:35:33.300 --> 1:35:38.260]  i mean if they had me on tar max with uranium to the russians i say arrest
[1:35:38.260 --> 1:35:41.540]  me
[1:35:41.540 --> 1:35:44.980]  and i love how he walks from these other people they all color coordinate that
[1:35:44.980 --> 1:35:47.860]  have the same ties just different colors and it's all
[1:35:47.860 --> 1:35:50.580]  like this fashion show he walks real like he's
[1:35:50.580 --> 1:35:54.420]  powerful just look at me and i'm like oh it's muller
[1:35:54.420 --> 1:35:57.860]  i mean this is a new royalty and the media spins that goes
[1:35:57.860 --> 1:36:02.740]  jones believes that muller will be made literal king of earth newsweek
[1:36:02.740 --> 1:36:05.860]  jones is totally insane in between saying there's slave
[1:36:05.860 --> 1:36:09.860]  colonies on mars never said that no video no audio
[1:36:09.860 --> 1:36:13.380]  in between saying there's mars colonies of slaves
[1:36:13.380 --> 1:36:17.540]  jones says muller will be a king i'm saying he's
[1:36:17.540 --> 1:36:21.540]  acting outside of government and law as a coup d'etat
[1:36:21.540 --> 1:36:27.460]  just as congressman gertz congressman gates is now saying out of florida
[1:36:27.460 --> 1:36:31.380]  we're going to go back to dr pacinica in a moment just briefly

[1:38:15.540 --> 1:38:19.460]  overturned governments you name it and he's been talking about the civil war
[1:38:19.460 --> 1:38:22.740]  inside our government inside the intelligence agencies
[1:38:22.740 --> 1:38:26.260]  and what he sees getting ready to happen in the middle east
[1:38:26.260 --> 1:38:30.180]  where he sees what's happening with trump what's going on with muhler
[1:38:30.180 --> 1:38:35.460]  the fbi and where he sees this civil war uh or if he uses that term where he
[1:38:35.460 --> 1:38:38.980]  sees this power struggle right now so tell us what you think about trump
[1:38:38.980 --> 1:38:42.820]  the whole nine yards where you currently see us dr pacinic
[1:38:42.820 --> 1:38:48.420]  where i think trump did a very good job going into the far east i complimented
[1:38:48.420 --> 1:38:52.260]  him in that in one of my blogs recently i just said i believe
[1:38:52.260 --> 1:38:56.260]  he may have made a deal through russia and china
[1:38:56.260 --> 1:38:59.940]  to contain north korea and i think that's sufficient
[1:38:59.940 --> 1:39:04.500]  right now and when he signaled into the press in the united state
[1:39:04.500 --> 1:39:08.100]  don't worry that was the real trump in other words
[1:39:08.100 --> 1:39:13.300]  what you had when he was you know blustering and and saying things about
[1:39:13.300 --> 1:39:17.940]  uh kim jong-un was part of the art of the deal in other words for america to
[1:39:17.940 --> 1:39:22.020]  understand trump you really have to read his book it's not
[1:39:22.020 --> 1:39:27.060]  that easy to be erratic or he's impulsive it's that he believes that
[1:39:27.060 --> 1:39:32.100]  certain certain approach to people is very successful for him
[1:39:32.100 --> 1:39:38.980]  and at this point in time china was uh acquiesced basically acted as a very
[1:39:38.980 --> 1:39:43.780]  good ally for us japan uh was excellent with us
[1:39:43.780 --> 1:39:47.380]  and and so was south korea he had a very good relationship with
[1:39:47.380 --> 1:39:52.340]  mr moon president moon of south korea but what he reminded
[1:39:52.340 --> 1:39:55.940]  uh north korea and and this was very important
[1:39:55.940 --> 1:39:59.220]  he had in one of his meetings with south korea
[1:39:59.220 --> 1:40:05.860]  a uh korean a woman from north korea who had been a comfort woman for the
[1:40:05.860 --> 1:40:10.740]  japanese when they controlled all of korea she was in the late 80s and 90s
[1:40:10.740 --> 1:40:14.740]  means a sex life correct a sex life that thank you
[1:40:14.740 --> 1:40:19.780]  alex and that signal went to north korea that remember the one country
[1:40:19.780 --> 1:40:24.100]  that korea is totally frightened up more than us
[1:40:24.100 --> 1:40:29.620]  more than china even russia is japan because they know how brutal japan
[1:40:29.620 --> 1:40:35.460]  was to korea over a hundred years so he used that to signal in to say
[1:40:35.460 --> 1:40:39.540]  don't mess with us he sent three to four aircraft carriers
[1:40:39.540 --> 1:40:43.540]  and think back they did a great job sure so how is he doing a great job there but
[1:40:43.540 --> 1:40:47.060]  now because i was thinking it's good to have you saw the arabia going after some
[1:40:47.060 --> 1:40:49.940]  of the radicals and breaking up some of the networks i mean i want to go back
[1:40:49.940 --> 1:40:53.700]  to that the fbi muller his whole thing where's that going
[1:40:53.700 --> 1:40:59.140]  in other words he can control uh you know there are many things that are
[1:40:59.140 --> 1:41:04.340]  cover us and for whatever reason he's allowed muller to remain
[1:41:04.340 --> 1:41:08.420]  i agree with bannon and with you and with others he should have been
[1:41:08.420 --> 1:41:11.700]  dismissed and and i actually arrested muller
[1:41:11.700 --> 1:41:15.940]  comes out of the very interesting background the white angle sacks and
[1:41:15.940 --> 1:41:18.900]  protestant who served bravely in vietnam
[1:41:18.900 --> 1:41:22.580]  and compromised his entire life in integrity
[1:41:22.580 --> 1:41:27.540]  for 9 11 and he was appointed the head of the fbi just before 9 11
[1:41:27.540 --> 1:41:31.940]  this was part of the bush gang the bush family which should have been in prison
[1:41:31.940 --> 1:41:35.700]  one of the most detrimental families to the american history
[1:41:35.700 --> 1:41:40.340]  when bannon correctly said 43 was a disaster
[1:41:40.340 --> 1:41:44.900]  one of the worst presidents we've ever had he really made the point i mean he's
[1:41:44.900 --> 1:41:47.780]  obviously a mental midget mental patient i mean
[1:41:47.780 --> 1:41:53.780]  w is a vegetable almost no well he's not only he was an idiot to begin with and
[1:41:53.780 --> 1:41:58.340]  he's an idiot now but i mean it goes back to the father whom i worked with and i
[1:41:58.340 --> 1:42:01.940]  kept quiet until he opened his mouth about trump
[1:42:01.940 --> 1:42:06.740]  saying that he's a blowhard and then i i i i went right into bush
[1:42:06.740 --> 1:42:11.140]  seniors saying number one you better be careful because we know about the fact
[1:42:11.140 --> 1:42:16.020]  you weren't shut down you you know you ejected from that jet plane
[1:42:16.020 --> 1:42:19.700]  that you are the plane that you were in and you were cowardly
[1:42:19.700 --> 1:42:23.220]  secondly we know very well you were part of the hinkley
[1:42:23.220 --> 1:42:27.860]  organization that is fascinated to try to assassinate reagan
[1:42:27.860 --> 1:42:31.780]  for the reasons that have to do with the session and the vice presidency and the
[1:42:31.780 --> 1:42:35.460]  fact that reagan was far more demented than anybody knew
[1:42:35.460 --> 1:42:39.940]  now that's not coming out you see the narrative that came out to america was
[1:42:39.940 --> 1:42:44.260]  a narrative that we had a great president america first under reagan
[1:42:44.260 --> 1:42:48.580]  nonsense reagan was already compromised
[1:42:48.580 --> 1:42:51.940]  nancy reagan who was more brilliant than anybody
[1:42:51.940 --> 1:42:56.980]  was basically understood that she hated the bushes she said that you
[1:42:56.980 --> 1:42:59.540]  developed living defense for us it took you over a year to do it
[1:42:59.540 --> 1:43:03.860]  why is this so good because people are actually waking up to the problem that
[1:43:03.860 --> 1:43:08.420]  pretty much scares me the most i mean i try to make sure that i don't
[1:43:08.420 --> 1:43:12.020]  put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system but
[1:43:12.020 --> 1:43:16.180]  right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything

[1:43:33.620 --> 1:43:37.460]  wood i recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year

[1:47:27.380 --> 1:47:32.020]  and mr speaker we are at risk of a coup d'etat
[1:47:32.020 --> 1:47:36.580]  in this country if we allow an unaccountable person
[1:47:36.580 --> 1:47:41.860]  with no oversight to undermine the duly elected president of the united
[1:47:41.860 --> 1:47:46.020]  states and i would offer that is precisely what is happening right now
[1:47:46.020 --> 1:47:49.540]  with the indisputable conflicts of interest
[1:47:49.540 --> 1:47:53.380]  that are present with mr moeller and others at the department of justice
[1:47:53.380 --> 1:47:56.500]  i join my colleague the gentleman from arizona
[1:47:56.500 --> 1:48:01.460]  in calling for mr moeller's resignation or his firing
[1:48:01.460 --> 1:48:05.380]  moreover we absolutely have to see the department of justice
[1:48:05.380 --> 1:48:09.860]  appoint a special counsel to look into the clinton foundation
[1:48:09.860 --> 1:48:13.860]  the uranium one deal and the fusion gps dossier
[1:48:13.860 --> 1:48:17.700]  that i will now have the opportunity to discuss
[1:48:17.700 --> 1:48:21.780]  i really don't know who's investigating the uranium one deal right now
[1:48:21.780 --> 1:48:26.420]  i know that in july the chairman of the judiciary committee along with 20
[1:48:26.420 --> 1:48:30.660]  members of the judiciary committee sent a letter to attorney general sessions
[1:48:30.660 --> 1:48:34.420]  asking who would be looking into these critical questions
[1:48:34.420 --> 1:48:39.220]  demanding that a special counsel be appointed to conduct a thorough review
[1:48:39.220 --> 1:48:43.140]  and it is extremely disappointing that the chairman of the judiciary committee
[1:48:43.140 --> 1:48:46.340]  and my fellow members have received no response
[1:48:46.340 --> 1:48:50.180]  from the department of justice as to that letter
[1:48:50.180 --> 1:48:54.180]  i don't know whether the attorney general's refusal on matters related to
[1:48:54.180 --> 1:48:58.740]  russia impacts influences or in any way covers the
[1:48:58.740 --> 1:49:02.740]  all right that is house representative matt gates republican
[1:49:02.740 --> 1:49:06.340]  florida who we're just seeing more and more great great things from very very
[1:49:06.340 --> 1:49:11.380]  excited about the work he's doing and i'm just going to leave it at that
[1:49:11.380 --> 1:49:15.220]  but he's really dialed into what's happening and they're going around
[1:49:15.220 --> 1:49:17.620]  canvassing saying we're about to take trump out
[1:49:17.620 --> 1:49:22.260]  extra judicially are you going to go along with it is kind of a threat
[1:49:22.260 --> 1:49:26.100]  dr cipa chenic of cipa chenic dot com uh is our guest
[1:49:26.100 --> 1:49:29.380]  i've got to ask you a question doc just selfishly because i respect to your one
[1:49:29.380 --> 1:49:32.980]  of the most accurate folks we've had on the last 15 years or so since i've been
[1:49:32.980 --> 1:49:36.900]  interviewing you were 16 years now
[1:49:36.900 --> 1:49:41.140]  when you look at this it's creepy when they have congressional house
[1:49:41.140 --> 1:49:45.700]  intelligence committee meetings hearings and they say
[1:49:45.700 --> 1:49:49.460]  at lunch we're watching info wars and we've got to stop them
[1:49:49.460 --> 1:49:53.140]  and and and the congressman suggests you must do a better job and like well sir
[1:49:53.140 --> 1:49:55.780]  we we're having you know the artificial system shut
[1:49:55.780 --> 1:50:00.260]  him down but it's not perfect yet and it's not
[1:50:00.260 --> 1:50:06.020]  grandstanding demonizing us say on cnn because i know that
[1:50:06.020 --> 1:50:09.300]  i don't want to make us too important we just kind of represent the populist
[1:50:09.300 --> 1:50:13.380]  americana movement they hate we're just a focal point of that
[1:50:13.380 --> 1:50:16.740]  but they picked us up thinking it would hurt trump
[1:50:16.740 --> 1:50:20.900]  and magnified us even more and then i'm watching him with all the algorithms
[1:50:20.900 --> 1:50:25.220]  admittedly shut us down but then it causes a strizan effect
[1:50:25.220 --> 1:50:29.860]  for every time they try to shut us down it causes it to bang up even higher
[1:50:29.860 --> 1:50:33.620]  and they're getting more and more frustrated
[1:50:33.620 --> 1:50:38.180]  to the point of you know having op ed saying just take alex jones out
[1:50:38.180 --> 1:50:42.580]  and i'm not even afraid personally of of dying i don't want to die but i just
[1:50:42.580 --> 1:50:45.460]  it's a switch you flip it off i just feel bad about here for my
[1:50:45.460 --> 1:50:47.860]  children but these are bad people they've got to be
[1:50:47.860 --> 1:50:50.820]  stood up against but at the same time i just want to have a free country in
[1:50:50.820 --> 1:50:55.140]  prosperity i'm not fighting for the power trough like they are
[1:50:55.140 --> 1:50:59.300]  and they just hate me so much and i want to ask you
[1:50:59.300 --> 1:51:02.420]  not just oh we're very effective and oh this and that
[1:51:02.420 --> 1:51:05.300]  i i don't understand why they hate us this much
[1:51:05.300 --> 1:51:09.460]  and how they think they're going to beat us because
[1:51:09.460 --> 1:51:14.020]  trying to destroy us has taken us from being supported
[1:51:14.020 --> 1:51:18.580]  by and large by the audience to now it's taken on a whole new thing
[1:51:18.580 --> 1:51:22.180]  and people really get it now and really listen to me
[1:51:22.180 --> 1:51:26.740]  and our guests like yourself in the fbi in the cia in the local police
[1:51:26.740 --> 1:51:30.980]  departments and i mean it's shocking how much the government listens now
[1:51:30.980 --> 1:51:34.500]  and is gone from kind of like oh he's quirky but you know gets it right
[1:51:34.500 --> 1:51:38.900]  sometimes to like really listening to what we say as if it's super
[1:51:38.900 --> 1:51:41.700]  authoritative which compared to mainstream media it is but i still
[1:51:41.700 --> 1:51:46.100]  make mistakes i mean it's let me say it for 44 years old in this position
[1:51:46.100 --> 1:51:52.420]  it is creepy and and uh and it scares me that info wars would be
[1:51:52.420 --> 1:51:55.860]  the thing they're most afraid of can you speak to that and into the audience
[1:51:55.860 --> 1:51:58.660]  because it's the audience they fear
[1:51:58.660 --> 1:52:02.100]  well they really fear you quite frankly
[1:52:02.100 --> 1:52:07.460]  and the reason they fear unit that it was so long is you the only boys that
[1:52:07.460 --> 1:52:10.980]  could articulate our discontent including mine
[1:52:10.980 --> 1:52:15.780]  i mean after 9 11 within minutes i knew exactly who did it
[1:52:15.780 --> 1:52:20.260]  i knew the names of the people but even if i went on the on the air
[1:52:20.260 --> 1:52:27.620]  it didn't have the same impact of an alex jones alex jones isn't just a person
[1:52:27.620 --> 1:52:31.460]  and this is what i've been saying all along that's why you and i can
[1:52:31.460 --> 1:52:35.540]  disagree but alex jones has become a persona
[1:52:35.540 --> 1:52:40.420]  of the liberation in the 21st century of where we
[1:52:40.420 --> 1:52:44.660]  people not the people in los angeles new york i live here
[1:52:44.660 --> 1:52:49.220]  but the people who live in the south in an agrarian
[1:52:49.220 --> 1:52:53.620]  in the midwest in utah who are tired of a of a
[1:52:53.620 --> 1:52:58.340]  lies and the betrayals and the wars that we've been in
[1:52:58.340 --> 1:53:01.700]  they listen to you because for the first time you
[1:53:01.700 --> 1:53:04.980]  you're kind of the wolf of bronchite if i can say that
[1:53:04.980 --> 1:53:09.700]  of the of the internet age you're beginning to say things to that
[1:53:09.700 --> 1:53:13.460]  happening and it's it's occurring why do you and i come on the same show for
[1:53:13.460 --> 1:53:18.260]  16 years i don't go on any other show why are they so afraid of me that
[1:53:18.260 --> 1:53:22.580]  supposedly i can take them down sure i could take them down but we're doing
[1:53:22.580 --> 1:53:26.980]  it already my friend the minute hillary clinton
[1:53:26.980 --> 1:53:32.580]  pointed her finger at you is the problem we had already won a war and she was
[1:53:32.580 --> 1:53:36.260]  finished when you wake up the people to the truth
[1:53:36.260 --> 1:53:40.340]  it's very dangerous to those in the system i'm not in the system
[1:53:40.340 --> 1:53:42.980]  ironically i have all those degrees m i t
[1:53:42.980 --> 1:53:48.420]  the army but they knew they could not control me even though i was trained to be
[1:53:48.420 --> 1:53:53.300]  into the intelligence service or the state department they couldn't control me
[1:53:53.300 --> 1:53:58.340]  what kind of a guy you and i are very similar when they promoted me to rear
[1:53:58.340 --> 1:54:02.420]  admiral i said are you not i'm not taking your rear admiral i'm not
[1:54:02.420 --> 1:54:05.700]  taking your money i just wanted to mess up in this
[1:54:05.700 --> 1:54:09.700]  country because i wasn't born here and i went out just like you did and most of
[1:54:09.700 --> 1:54:12.580]  america let me just add this point because it's again
[1:54:12.580 --> 1:54:15.620]  i see the sycophantic behavior the power trips the red carpet
[1:54:15.620 --> 1:54:18.900]  i say this not to say that i don't want the power i'm saying it that it's the
[1:54:18.900 --> 1:54:21.220]  opposite with this level of responsibility
[1:54:21.220 --> 1:54:24.980]  i i can't stand myself most of the time because i want to do a better job i
[1:54:24.980 --> 1:54:28.340]  want to really get it right and i don't and then i realize the responsibility
[1:54:28.340 --> 1:54:31.540]  is it isn't me it's all the guests it's the listeners
[1:54:31.540 --> 1:54:35.700]  it's something that's been built up as an art type and that's why they're trying
[1:54:35.700 --> 1:54:39.940]  to destroy me the person because they're trying to destroy the image of hope
[1:54:39.940 --> 1:54:43.060]  and resistance and not caring when you get attacked
[1:54:43.060 --> 1:54:49.700]  and that's what they hate and and but then it's the responsibility of having
[1:54:49.700 --> 1:54:53.060]  that much responsibility it's it's and now look at these people
[1:54:53.060 --> 1:54:56.500]  who want power but then when they get it they have no responsibility
[1:54:56.500 --> 1:55:00.660]  they just want to like uh you basically showboat around all day
[1:55:00.660 --> 1:55:04.660]  and that's what disgust me well that's the point you see what you've
[1:55:04.660 --> 1:55:08.580]  done is to say look the emperor has no clothes there is no power
[1:55:08.580 --> 1:55:12.820]  mule really has no power jeff's fashion should be thrown out
[1:55:12.820 --> 1:55:17.940]  honestly too weak all of those politicians are weak by nature they go
[1:55:17.940 --> 1:55:22.820]  into politics to self-aggrandize you don't go into politics
[1:55:22.820 --> 1:55:27.220]  uh if you want to build a company or you want to build a radio show or you want
[1:55:27.220 --> 1:55:30.500]  to write novels you go into politics because you want to
[1:55:30.500 --> 1:55:34.420]  self-aggrandize and manipulate but you're not that good at it
[1:55:34.420 --> 1:55:38.420]  so you have 80-year-old diane feinstein you have 80-year-old
[1:55:38.420 --> 1:55:43.460]  mccain and it's become a joke you have a muller who was already criminally
[1:55:43.460 --> 1:55:48.340]  indicted for what he did in 9-11 for what he did in russia he knows that
[1:55:48.340 --> 1:55:53.220]  he knows he's corrupt he was so but he has to come back and try to but make
[1:55:53.220 --> 1:55:56.020]  believe that he's not corrupt but he corrupt
[1:55:56.020 --> 1:56:00.660]  komi's corrupt half or half of that fdi is corrupt
[1:56:00.660 --> 1:56:05.140]  let me ask you this question then don't they societally culturally know the
[1:56:05.140 --> 1:56:09.060]  worms turned globally and that they even if they got you or me or trump or
[1:56:09.060 --> 1:56:11.860]  anybody that only makes it bigger don't they understand
[1:56:11.860 --> 1:56:15.460]  they're on the wrong side of history the tide has moved on
[1:56:15.460 --> 1:56:20.020]  no no they didn't understand it from the day 9 11 occurred and they all were
[1:56:20.020 --> 1:56:25.460]  conspirators with that moron uh bush and before him his father wasn't very
[1:56:25.460 --> 1:56:29.780]  bright so you have a moronic family where neil
[1:56:29.780 --> 1:56:33.620]  and marvin create the s and l crisis in naryland
[1:56:33.620 --> 1:56:37.380]  then they come back and create the same crisis 2008
[1:56:37.380 --> 1:56:42.260]  six with the banking crisis so what you have are idiots repeating their
[1:56:42.260 --> 1:56:46.580]  same activity until nobody takes them out or nobody arrests them
[1:56:46.580 --> 1:56:49.700]  why do they have so much power this prescott
[1:56:49.700 --> 1:56:54.500]  was the main lawyer when nazi germany failed uh and did did get a lot of the
[1:56:54.500 --> 1:56:57.540]  money it's been rumored to be in the trillions of
[1:56:57.540 --> 1:57:00.340]  today's numbers i mean is that really did you ever know that's all super
[1:57:00.340 --> 1:57:04.260]  classified but did you ever come across them in the nazi money
[1:57:04.260 --> 1:57:08.820]  yes well the issue of prescott is he was not a very bright man
[1:57:08.820 --> 1:57:12.260]  he was a man who was kind of the toady for a brown
[1:57:12.260 --> 1:57:16.580]  and harriman company the major man there was harriman
[1:57:16.580 --> 1:57:20.180]  governor he was far more than i understand i'm saying after world war two
[1:57:20.180 --> 1:57:22.900]  is the word is they got the keys of the kingdom
[1:57:22.900 --> 1:57:27.060]  that's correct so did alan dulles and his brother all of whom worked for the
[1:57:27.060 --> 1:57:31.220]  not all of whom allowed the fact to go on all of them well
[1:57:31.220 --> 1:57:34.180]  i mean as we know the kennedys were basically nazi agents
[1:57:34.180 --> 1:57:37.300]  correct let's come back in 70 seconds and talk about that with dr steve

[2:00:12.100 --> 2:00:16.900]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:17.620 --> 2:00:20.260]  it's always good to get out to see pochennecon and talk about the water
[2:00:20.260 --> 2:00:26.260]  front here we have a guest who's been in the
[2:00:26.260 --> 2:00:29.460]  army in intelligence and is in a private contractor he got picked up a
[2:00:29.460 --> 2:00:32.980]  couple days for the fbi but was let out he's getting a lawyer and come back on
[2:00:32.980 --> 2:00:36.660]  and he's saying that vegas and much other stuff is deep state things to get
[2:00:36.660 --> 2:00:40.900]  at trump and civil war things i just see how the media is using it
[2:00:40.900 --> 2:00:43.300]  but in the four or five minutes we have left here before i come back cover a
[2:00:43.300 --> 2:00:47.700]  bunch of news you've got the air force caught running this race hoax thing
[2:00:47.700 --> 2:00:51.140]  we've got clear social engineering going on to divide the country
[2:00:51.140 --> 2:00:55.140]  but it's not working and prosperity is coming back
[2:00:55.140 --> 2:00:58.500]  and you heard that clip earlier of the congressman
[2:00:58.500 --> 2:01:04.020]  uh in florida basically saying Mueller's trying to engage in some form of
[2:01:04.020 --> 2:01:09.780]  legalistic coup but again if they indict the president he's separate and so it
[2:01:09.780 --> 2:01:14.820]  would have to then be an impeachment that would come from that and that's to
[2:01:14.820 --> 2:01:19.380]  overturn an elected president when the person running the investigation is in
[2:01:19.380 --> 2:01:23.860]  bed with the russians uh it's it's it's it's it's it's beyond
[2:01:23.860 --> 2:01:27.460]  any level of hypocrisy i've ever seen dr pacenic
[2:01:27.460 --> 2:01:31.300]  where do you see this ending i see it ending with
[2:01:31.300 --> 2:01:36.660]  Mueller being fired i see it ending with that at the fbi once again being fired
[2:01:36.660 --> 2:01:42.180]  i see jeff sessions being fired i see all the weak compromised individuals
[2:01:42.180 --> 2:01:48.100]  around trump bannon pointed out being fired and i do see jarred
[2:01:48.100 --> 2:01:53.460]  possibly getting indicted for collusion and collusive activities
[2:01:53.460 --> 2:01:58.500]  i am not uh as upset as you are about what's happening because you have been
[2:01:58.500 --> 2:02:03.060]  the spear of what america needs but you have to remember none of these
[2:02:03.060 --> 2:02:08.180]  people from boston to washington to new york have ever been and understood the
[2:02:08.180 --> 2:02:14.180]  rural south midwest texas or austin they have no idea what austin means
[2:02:14.180 --> 2:02:18.820]  i knew what austin meant 20 years ago i knew it would be the focal center of
[2:02:18.820 --> 2:02:22.660]  power away from washington dc so what you see
[2:02:22.660 --> 2:02:27.540]  is the devolution of federal power the fact we don't need an fbi we don't need
[2:02:27.540 --> 2:02:29.860]  homeland security we don't need all these
[2:02:29.860 --> 2:02:35.380]  unsensical you know false flags which had no purpose whatsoever
[2:02:35.380 --> 2:02:39.060]  other than to try to justify having a huge bureaucracy
[2:02:39.060 --> 2:02:44.180]  which is worthless it's it's just a place where jobs are being handed out
[2:02:44.180 --> 2:02:48.500]  mule isn't only the problem i mean if you want to talk about nazi
[2:02:48.500 --> 2:02:54.660]  history where did mangler get funded the doctor who supposedly tortured all the
[2:02:54.660 --> 2:02:59.620]  jews you see israel doesn't talk about it neither do the american jews talk
[2:02:59.620 --> 2:03:03.300]  about it because they don't have any idea but i'll tell you exactly who funded
[2:03:03.300 --> 2:03:07.060]  mangler mangler was funded by the carnegian down in the
[2:03:07.060 --> 2:03:10.820]  rock of fellow brothers stanford university in the heart
[2:03:10.820 --> 2:03:14.500]  now that's right he was funded by colesprings harbour in new york
[2:03:14.500 --> 2:03:20.740]  and to the keiser vilham institute and and literally yeah now we have never
[2:03:20.740 --> 2:03:25.220]  talked you and i have never talked about the real corrupt institutions where
[2:03:25.220 --> 2:03:29.140]  unfortunately they were raping our students and that is the colleges and
[2:03:29.140 --> 2:03:33.220]  university cornell university where i went the feeding
[2:03:33.220 --> 2:03:37.060]  grounds for the neocons for 9-11, wolfer with
[2:03:37.060 --> 2:03:43.140]  adly, all of those guys pukehama all part of that 9-11 thing cornell never
[2:03:43.140 --> 2:03:46.260]  wanted to address it when i addressed cornell medical
[2:03:46.260 --> 2:03:49.700]  school and said you were sold out after 150 years
[2:03:49.700 --> 2:03:53.460]  to a crook sandy wild they didn't want to address it
[2:03:53.460 --> 2:03:57.540]  the same thing i said about harbour you didn't want to address it
[2:03:57.540 --> 2:04:01.860]  each institution in the iv league is so compromised
[2:04:01.860 --> 2:04:05.300]  because i've been there and i went through them so fast
[2:04:05.300 --> 2:04:09.540]  not because i'm that smart but that because they are so incompetent
[2:04:09.540 --> 2:04:14.180]  even when i went to mit i saw the nonsense that was being taught
[2:04:14.180 --> 2:04:17.620]  in the guise of engineering and social science
[2:04:17.620 --> 2:04:22.500]  it wasn't an accident i was trained on the internet in the 1970s by men like
[2:04:22.500 --> 2:04:25.220]  russian pie they feel the soul of cool ben
[2:04:25.220 --> 2:04:29.700]  counten guys who really cared about america but one thing was important they
[2:04:29.700 --> 2:04:34.500]  had all served in the military when you don't serve in our military you don't
[2:04:34.500 --> 2:04:38.180]  serve our country you do not have the respect of the

[2:05:47.860 --> 2:05:51.860]  the articles and buy products from us and then we commit to rampage against the
[2:05:51.860 --> 2:05:54.580]  enemy totally
[2:06:00.180 --> 2:06:04.900]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide
[2:06:04.900 --> 2:06:32.900]  it's alex jones
[2:06:32.900 --> 2:06:36.580]  there's several big issues here
[2:06:37.060 --> 2:06:42.020]  there is the incredible aged nature of the current globalist elite
[2:06:42.020 --> 2:06:45.140]  that basically inherited the technology and the hard work
[2:06:45.140 --> 2:06:48.900]  of past generations partlated into global power and their own
[2:06:48.900 --> 2:06:54.740]  incredibly fabulous wealth and then they had to hate america while they were
[2:06:54.740 --> 2:06:58.980]  using it and sucking it dry and they put operatives anyway to america
[2:06:58.980 --> 2:07:01.700]  because if you're going to be willing to sell out your own countrymen
[2:07:01.700 --> 2:07:05.220]  well then you've got to you know have some type of inherent hatred for them
[2:07:05.220 --> 2:07:08.900]  and so there was a process of people getting more and more extreme
[2:07:08.900 --> 2:07:12.420]  in the globalist structure hating their own cultures
[2:07:12.420 --> 2:07:15.700]  hating their own nationhood hating their system
[2:07:15.700 --> 2:07:19.620]  because it's hard to get enough sociopaths who'll just do it to be
[2:07:19.620 --> 2:07:22.820]  mercenaries you've got to get enough people that actually hate the country
[2:07:22.820 --> 2:07:26.740]  because they believe it and that's why you get the sjw
[2:07:26.740 --> 2:07:31.700]  liberal anti america anti christian anti god type brainwashing
[2:07:31.700 --> 2:07:34.900]  now there was a photo a few weeks ago of lady gaga
[2:07:34.900 --> 2:07:40.340]  with five of the past presidents and four of those presidents the next week
[2:07:40.340 --> 2:07:43.540]  bill clinton george w bush george herbert walker bush and brock obama
[2:07:43.540 --> 2:07:47.940]  all came out scripted calling president trump different names
[2:07:47.940 --> 2:07:51.780]  jimmy carter said what's happening the president's wrong
[2:07:51.780 --> 2:07:55.780]  and he's actually doing a pretty good job and the election was stolen hillary
[2:07:55.780 --> 2:07:59.140]  stolen then you saw donald brazil come out and say that and say hey
[2:07:59.140 --> 2:08:02.740]  seth rich was killed politically we should investigate this shows
[2:08:02.740 --> 2:08:07.620]  civil wars within the power structure but it shows the disconnect of people
[2:08:07.620 --> 2:08:10.980]  still running things that they would think having the
[2:08:10.980 --> 2:08:16.020]  unpopular former presidents come out against trump
[2:08:16.020 --> 2:08:20.900]  but that would somehow hurt him then they come out with more fake polls just
[2:08:20.900 --> 2:08:26.660]  like they did during the election trumps up at 65 so again
[2:08:26.660 --> 2:08:30.340]  what's crazy is to see the old
[2:08:30.340 --> 2:08:34.500]  so-called elite these corrupt folks that hijacked our country
[2:08:34.500 --> 2:08:38.820]  and then hated it at the same time you know just classic projection
[2:08:38.820 --> 2:08:42.260]  ruling over the nation running it in the ground
[2:08:42.260 --> 2:08:45.860]  it shows their fundamental disconnect it's theirs they had it why run at the
[2:08:45.860 --> 2:08:48.820]  ground i mean trumps not even perfect you don't want to run
[2:08:48.820 --> 2:08:52.980]  this beautiful horse into the ground why not put it out to
[2:08:52.980 --> 2:08:56.340]  for stud and you know free the whole planet again
[2:08:56.340 --> 2:09:00.100]  it's the pissant it's what i call privately the chicken you know what
[2:09:00.100 --> 2:09:03.700]  dimension the chicken sh you know what dimension i'm
[2:09:03.700 --> 2:09:06.820]  quoting that term here it's a private term i've had for years
[2:09:06.820 --> 2:09:14.500]  they just want to screw people over and not have prosperity and weaken the host
[2:09:14.500 --> 2:09:18.260]  because they just have such bad instincts they're just so mentally ill
[2:09:18.260 --> 2:09:21.540]  i don't have a psychiatry degree like dr steve pochennick
[2:09:21.540 --> 2:09:24.340]  and i haven't run you know mental institutions like he has
[2:09:24.340 --> 2:09:30.420]  i just use my own lay terms to describe the false delusional smugness of a
[2:09:30.420 --> 2:09:34.340]  moron like george w bush who looks like an elf the title of
[2:09:34.340 --> 2:09:38.020]  odemy so so just in closing what does it
[2:09:38.020 --> 2:09:41.700]  telegraph am i wrong am i right that that they think attacking
[2:09:41.700 --> 2:09:45.940]  trump makes them strong and they think fake polls make them strong
[2:09:45.940 --> 2:09:49.860]  and you really study them it's true they're living like a creature that
[2:09:49.860 --> 2:09:53.220]  stole something else's shell they didn't produce the shell
[2:09:53.220 --> 2:09:56.020]  they just moved into the ruins of civilization
[2:09:56.020 --> 2:10:00.180]  and then believe they are civilization but also are threatened
[2:10:00.180 --> 2:10:04.580]  by the shininess of the ghost of the renaissance it's just it's just
[2:10:04.580 --> 2:10:10.100]  they're just losers you articulate very well let me just say you picked the
[2:10:10.100 --> 2:10:14.020]  right president i worked with jimmy carter i wasn't always in agreement
[2:10:14.020 --> 2:10:17.780]  the one thing that jimmy carter did have he was a
[2:10:17.780 --> 2:10:24.100]  Baptist he was a christian a Christian who believed in the faith and one other
[2:10:24.100 --> 2:10:27.140]  thing he did the only president of the united
[2:10:27.140 --> 2:10:32.660]  state who got rid of 4 000 cia operatives i can't tell you how important
[2:10:32.660 --> 2:10:37.540]  that is he got rid of 4 000 of them and said we don't need them
[2:10:37.540 --> 2:10:41.380]  and guess who he put in he put the number one admiral
[2:10:41.380 --> 2:10:45.860]  at the naval academy stanfield turner who i worked with
[2:10:45.860 --> 2:10:50.340]  to be the head of the cia and jimmy carter is the only president
[2:10:50.340 --> 2:10:55.860]  who has made peace in the last 50 years in israel but my question is why is he
[2:10:55.860 --> 2:10:58.100]  the only one to break with the other presidents
[2:10:58.100 --> 2:11:01.860]  in a concerted attack on trump people he's a Baptist
[2:11:01.860 --> 2:11:05.940]  number two he was highly educated at the naval academy
[2:11:05.940 --> 2:11:10.820]  he knew our history he was governor he's a nuclear physicist he's a nuclear
[2:11:10.820 --> 2:11:14.500]  physicist but what i'm saying is he had his problems and i didn't but he was
[2:11:14.500 --> 2:11:17.380]  manipulated i agree but what does it signify that
[2:11:17.380 --> 2:11:21.060]  he basically came out and back trump all the others came out against him
[2:11:21.060 --> 2:11:27.220]  thinking he understood that the problems of a presidency isn't just about the
[2:11:27.220 --> 2:11:32.100]  rhetoric what what you had and also he didn't come out of the cia
[2:11:32.100 --> 2:11:39.460]  you have bush senior cia 1957 not 1971 57 you have bush
[2:11:39.460 --> 2:11:44.340]  juniors cia you have obama what i call the black baby of the cia
[2:11:44.340 --> 2:11:50.020]  mother worked in in indonesia she was an anthropologist who spoke russian
[2:11:50.020 --> 2:11:54.340]  you have clinton cia bill clinton was reporting
[2:11:54.340 --> 2:11:58.740]  the agents and never got started at oxford university
[2:11:58.740 --> 2:12:04.340]  and he was covered by another cia operative from yale called stroked albit
[2:12:04.340 --> 2:12:08.420]  so you have this insidious organization two of them
[2:12:08.420 --> 2:12:13.700]  the fbi and cia that work in the dark and really are not
[2:12:13.700 --> 2:12:18.820]  effective for american democracy what carter did was to clean out
[2:12:18.820 --> 2:12:24.020]  the cia and literally put it into the military structure which is what we
[2:12:24.020 --> 2:12:28.500]  had hoped to happen here but i'm hoping and maybe that's where i got
[2:12:28.500 --> 2:12:33.140]  i'm really angry with is that we don't continue to go to war
[2:12:33.140 --> 2:12:36.420]  trump said we won't go to war and i believe him
[2:12:36.420 --> 2:12:40.260]  we didn't go to war north korea and hopefully we don't but he's being
[2:12:40.260 --> 2:12:43.380]  he's being manipulated into it because he's still being ignored by a lot of
[2:12:43.380 --> 2:12:43.860]  folks
[2:12:43.860 --> 2:12:47.300]  wow correct you i mean you're you're more and more being proven right about
[2:12:47.300 --> 2:12:50.660]  kelly i mean you kind of really jumped on me for
[2:12:50.660 --> 2:12:54.260]  because i mean the news was saying kelly not only that let me let me explain
[2:12:54.260 --> 2:12:58.100]  something it's not about being right or wrong you and i will never disagree
[2:12:58.100 --> 2:13:01.620]  about that people but we we have to understand it's really the
[2:13:01.620 --> 2:13:06.020]  imposter's on this level in other words what is important at a particular
[2:13:06.020 --> 2:13:09.700]  time you and i are on the right plate we're both being attacked
[2:13:09.700 --> 2:13:12.660]  you're being attacked i'm being attacked there's no
[2:13:12.660 --> 2:13:17.060]  question that google works for the natural geostatial agency
[2:13:17.060 --> 2:13:21.140]  and that amazon has contracts from the cia
[2:13:21.140 --> 2:13:24.980]  what are we talking about we're talking about another dimension
[2:13:24.980 --> 2:13:30.580]  where companies are so big they override any government institutions so the
[2:13:30.580 --> 2:13:34.180]  government institutions become part of that big company
[2:13:34.180 --> 2:13:39.940]  so you have bang you have all those facebook amazon and trump needs to go
[2:13:39.940 --> 2:13:43.620]  after trump needs to go out for facebook google and and twitter and these
[2:13:43.620 --> 2:13:47.860]  monopolies yes yes he has to go after facebook he has to go
[2:13:47.860 --> 2:13:51.940]  after days let me ask you this why are they so arrogant to say
[2:13:51.940 --> 2:13:56.020]  the head of operations for twitter i don't worry i censored alex jones and
[2:13:56.020 --> 2:13:59.460]  paul watson at lunch and they and he's talking to a congressman going oh you
[2:13:59.460 --> 2:14:03.940]  saw it too yes they're the top story don't worry sir we killed it
[2:14:03.940 --> 2:14:07.700]  it's the arrogance of power and stupidity these are all
[2:14:07.700 --> 2:14:11.380]  boiled little brat who might happen to know from stanford
[2:14:11.380 --> 2:14:16.260]  they all went up 20 30 years ago and have created nothing but a little bit of
[2:14:16.260 --> 2:14:20.660]  one and zero numbers put together and they've created nothing
[2:14:20.660 --> 2:14:24.420]  you'll become the target in a way that allows us
[2:14:24.420 --> 2:14:29.220]  to attack the others these people so when google of course it's totally dumb to
[2:14:29.220 --> 2:14:33.700]  say on national television we're censoring people in live time
[2:14:33.700 --> 2:14:37.940]  because they say a muslin ran over people with a car it was true by the way
[2:14:37.940 --> 2:14:41.300]  i mean it's just they're crazy i understand but
[2:14:41.300 --> 2:14:45.940]  you let them do that they continue to do that but see how dangerous it began
[2:14:45.940 --> 2:14:51.300]  when rand paul a senator a doctor an ophthalmologist the brilliant man was
[2:14:51.300 --> 2:14:55.460]  attacked quote by a neighbor for his belief i think
[2:14:55.460 --> 2:14:59.380]  there's more underneath that you do not break the risk of a
[2:14:59.380 --> 2:15:03.700]  major senator and get away with it and notice the guy hadn't gotten trouble
[2:15:03.700 --> 2:15:08.340]  class four felony that's like jaywalking i mean class four misdemeanor excuse me
[2:15:08.340 --> 2:15:12.340]  i want that man to go to prison but i also want the head of google to go to
[2:15:12.340 --> 2:15:15.700]  prison because they're manipulating they have
[2:15:15.700 --> 2:15:19.140]  overseas accounts in the cayman island you want to see how
[2:15:19.140 --> 2:15:24.020]  arrogant these guys are how arrogant our universities are go to the cayman island

[2:15:27.300 --> 2:15:30.740]  absolutely and and they're cornered rats now and they know they're in trouble
[2:15:30.740 --> 2:15:33.620]  that's why they're so desperate and they're afraid of we the people

[2:21:24.180 --> 2:21:27.780]  all right let me get into the serious news and clips now
[2:21:32.340 --> 2:21:36.500]  it came out earlier this year when
[2:21:36.500 --> 2:21:42.100]  australian executives of facebook leaked documents that made major
[2:21:42.100 --> 2:21:46.740]  publications surprisingly enough that facebook
[2:21:46.740 --> 2:21:51.140]  targets users that they think are alone lonely and depressed
[2:21:51.140 --> 2:21:56.500]  and then tries to use computer psychological warfare algorithms to keep
[2:21:56.500 --> 2:22:00.500]  them on facebook keep them depressed and sell
[2:22:00.500 --> 2:22:04.340]  things to them because they're depressed
[2:22:07.220 --> 2:22:10.420]  now i've said that for years you can see the models of all this
[2:22:10.420 --> 2:22:14.100]  and this headline of the one and guardian if you understand this
[2:22:14.100 --> 2:22:21.460]  you understand everything ex-facebook president shon parker
[2:22:21.460 --> 2:22:28.260]  site made to exploit human vulnerability to make people depressed
[2:22:28.260 --> 2:22:34.420]  to target children to target people that are alone
[2:22:34.500 --> 2:22:38.820]  and if you read deeper into the documents target liberals
[2:22:38.820 --> 2:22:42.420]  make them afraid of conservatives make them afraid of capitalism
[2:22:42.420 --> 2:22:48.500]  make them afraid of going outside and then have bots that manage them
[2:22:48.500 --> 2:22:52.100]  that are like fake friends that look like real people and that'll gather some
[2:22:52.100 --> 2:22:55.140]  other real people together to then get in an echo chamber
[2:22:55.140 --> 2:22:57.940]  see i learned a lot about them what they would always accuse me of
[2:22:57.940 --> 2:23:01.380]  jones is an expert in deception he gets an echo chamber going and then he
[2:23:01.380 --> 2:23:05.460]  he wants the dumbest followers and he targets them and he tries to make them
[2:23:05.460 --> 2:23:09.220]  scared and i'm like i'm trying to empower people i i'm trying to
[2:23:09.220 --> 2:23:13.220]  get them to take action i'm i'm trying to build a better world
[2:23:13.220 --> 2:23:19.460]  because i'm not exploiting human vulnerability i'm trying to show you
[2:23:19.460 --> 2:23:24.100]  vulnerabilities and i'm trying to exploit in a good way
[2:23:24.100 --> 2:23:29.220]  massive human expansion for myself and my children
[2:23:29.780 --> 2:23:32.740]  the only reason i want wealth is to defeat the enemy that wants to take me
[2:23:32.740 --> 2:23:36.580]  down and so that my children can hopefully be educated smart enough
[2:23:36.580 --> 2:23:40.980]  to exploit the high-tech technologies that don't give up their consciousness
[2:23:40.980 --> 2:23:45.940]  but do extend their lives but death is part of god's overall plan so i i don't
[2:23:45.940 --> 2:23:48.500]  want my children to live forever i want to live forever through their
[2:23:48.500 --> 2:23:52.020]  children but i i've got to be honest i selfishly
[2:23:52.020 --> 2:23:55.460]  don't like having children because someday they've got to die
[2:23:55.460 --> 2:23:59.700]  but i selfishly love them so much and want them to experience consciousness
[2:23:59.700 --> 2:24:03.940]  and god's gifts that i intend to have more
[2:24:03.940 --> 2:24:10.900]  but i love them so much that it hurts you know how it hurts
[2:24:10.900 --> 2:24:14.180]  and when i see other children and other people and i see the zombies of the
[2:24:14.180 --> 2:24:17.700]  globalist it hurts me that they're so fallen
[2:24:17.700 --> 2:24:22.980]  not that i'm so high but that i am aware of where they are
[2:24:22.980 --> 2:24:27.700]  then i catch myself like leaning on a cane or
[2:24:27.700 --> 2:24:34.580]  taking taking a lot of drink before you go up to be executed
[2:24:36.020 --> 2:24:39.940]  or like a man takes wine before he has to fight
[2:24:43.060 --> 2:24:45.300]  debt
[2:24:46.980 --> 2:24:53.540]  that they're so absolutely destroyed and fallen
[2:24:53.540 --> 2:24:57.700]  and i'll lean on kind of getting evil sometimes
[2:24:57.700 --> 2:25:01.540]  in private life and giggling and snickering at the enemies how twisted
[2:25:01.540 --> 2:25:05.860]  how hunchback spiritually how pathetic they are
[2:25:05.860 --> 2:25:10.180]  but then i see that's a human that fell completely
[2:25:10.180 --> 2:25:13.300]  and i catch myself being dominant above them
[2:25:13.300 --> 2:25:18.020]  and being awake and and being light years ahead of them even though i'm
[2:25:18.020 --> 2:25:22.820]  pathetic compared to god's great consciousness
[2:25:22.820 --> 2:25:26.420]  and i just can't take
[2:25:29.940 --> 2:25:33.380]  the break or the enjoyment that we're beating them
[2:25:33.380 --> 2:25:36.980]  or that they're pathetic and they're stupid because there's really
[2:25:36.980 --> 2:25:44.820]  no pleasure in that it's not real there's a false kind of exaltation
[2:25:44.820 --> 2:25:50.260]  invigoration over defeating your enemy or being better than them
[2:25:50.260 --> 2:25:55.620]  in their fallen worldly flesh-filled twisted
[2:25:55.620 --> 2:26:00.020]  position of an ansi Pelosi or john mccain
[2:26:00.260 --> 2:26:07.060]  then i realize hey that zombie creature that demon possessed
[2:26:08.180 --> 2:26:14.020]  husk has almost destroyed humanity so you laugh at that at your own peril
[2:26:14.020 --> 2:26:19.140]  because there's power in the masses of the zombies
[2:26:19.140 --> 2:26:23.700]  and the zombie kings like barack obama or george w bush or
[2:26:23.700 --> 2:26:27.460]  a michael moore i mean these zombie kings
[2:26:27.460 --> 2:26:32.260]  they're dangerous and and that they're unfeeling
[2:26:32.260 --> 2:26:35.140]  soullessness
[2:26:36.260 --> 2:26:41.620]  their lack of empathy and and all their counterfeits they projected us
[2:26:43.780 --> 2:26:48.340]  it's something else entirely so let me start playing some of these clips x
[2:26:48.340 --> 2:26:52.740]  facebook president john parker site made to exploit human vulnerability
[2:26:52.740 --> 2:26:59.540]  imagine something meant to supercharge human potential
[2:27:02.340 --> 2:27:08.580]  i mean imagine thinking like that but what unifies these globalists is
[2:27:08.580 --> 2:27:12.900]  they want to exploit stupid people so they want to make more stupid people
[2:27:12.900 --> 2:27:19.780]  as if that doesn't blow back on them it's it's very one-dimensional
[2:27:19.780 --> 2:27:22.020]  but
[2:27:23.140 --> 2:27:30.580]  john parker obviously has some soul in that he thinks
[2:27:30.580 --> 2:27:35.380]  calling your users dumb efforts oh our users trust us they're dumb efforts
[2:27:35.380 --> 2:27:39.460]  he thinks that's a bad idea but see if you think you're separate from humanity
[2:27:39.460 --> 2:27:44.500]  if you're a psychopath like mark zuckerberg
[2:27:44.500 --> 2:27:47.940]  you go i'm totally different from these people they're not like me oh i'm a god
[2:27:47.940 --> 2:27:52.900]  no you are a defect cancer cell that thinks it's dominant because it's
[2:27:52.900 --> 2:27:57.220]  replicating and taking over you are not what you claim you are
[2:27:57.220 --> 2:28:00.180]  we're going to play these clips when we come back
[2:28:00.180 --> 2:28:02.660]  and then i'm just going to play clip after clip of a bunch of other big news
[2:28:02.660 --> 2:28:05.620]  i've got uh and we're going to go into the fourth hour today

[2:33:28.260 --> 2:33:33.140]  so here's sean parker a couple clips we're gonna play
[2:33:33.140 --> 2:33:40.340]  telling us what we already know but see facebook users that are leftist
[2:33:40.340 --> 2:33:42.900]  they think they're part of a winning team they're part of this big liberal
[2:33:42.900 --> 2:33:46.740]  community and that's how they reach their friends and the whole thing is
[2:33:46.740 --> 2:33:50.580]  there to exploit them and to make them more depressed and then facebook
[2:33:50.580 --> 2:33:54.020]  runs ads for psychological services prozac type
[2:33:54.020 --> 2:33:56.500]  rugs google also has similar deals where they
[2:33:56.500 --> 2:34:00.980]  google pops up in a psychological surveys meant to induct you in just like
[2:34:00.980 --> 2:34:04.500]  video in public schools to being mentally ill
[2:34:04.500 --> 2:34:10.260]  make you depressed get you inserted into the psychiatric system
[2:34:10.260 --> 2:34:14.260]  and then blow you away put them on the grid
[2:34:14.260 --> 2:34:19.620]  let them play for a while and then blow them away
[2:34:19.620 --> 2:34:25.380]  a nice little computer doctor to suck everything out of you and take your

[2:34:39.860 --> 2:34:43.940]  some of the early money in facebook the guy with napster all of it
[2:34:43.940 --> 2:34:47.300]  he comes out and says god only knows what's doing to our children's brains
[2:34:47.300 --> 2:34:51.220]  well actually we do know mr parker
[2:34:51.380 --> 2:34:54.980]  it's lowering attention spans lowering iq creating what i call
[2:34:54.980 --> 2:35:02.100]  screen sickness
[2:35:02.260 --> 2:35:07.380]  it's amazing where they're now learning to only communicate through computers
[2:35:07.380 --> 2:35:11.060]  to other people to get to their friends they communicate through the computer
[2:35:11.060 --> 2:35:14.340]  that's watching and tracking them but then it controls the interactions
[2:35:14.340 --> 2:35:17.860]  and becomes the friend itself because it's a human machine
[2:35:17.860 --> 2:35:21.460]  interface with two humans interfacing through a machine
[2:35:21.460 --> 2:35:27.300]  it's like having sex with a robot but you're talking to your boyfriend
[2:35:27.300 --> 2:35:32.660]  while you do it so you start thinking the robot is your boyfriend
[2:35:37.620 --> 2:35:43.380]  see they want to make us the machines they want to make us comply
[2:35:44.020 --> 2:35:47.700]  with zuckerberg he's not going to wear the virtual reality goggles
[2:35:47.700 --> 2:35:51.140]  he's going to pose that photo where he walks among his slaves
[2:35:51.140 --> 2:35:54.660]  crouched over their computers wearing goggles
[2:35:54.660 --> 2:36:00.420]  they're in his world now and they see whatever he wants
[2:36:00.420 --> 2:36:05.860]  zuckerberg is a god
[2:36:07.540 --> 2:36:12.020]  but you look at him you just see a creepy psychopath
[2:36:12.020 --> 2:36:18.500]  okay we got contacted by facebook yesterday i'm not
[2:36:18.500 --> 2:36:22.660]  going to get into it yet but they think we're so stupid
[2:36:22.660 --> 2:36:25.700]  that's so ridiculous
[2:36:27.620 --> 2:36:30.660]  they didn't like what i was saying about old zookzook yesterday they wanted to
[2:36:30.660 --> 2:36:32.900]  stop
[2:36:32.900 --> 2:36:42.980]  i don't think so mr zookie mr robot boy
[2:36:42.980 --> 2:36:47.860]  oh mr zuckerberg's a front man you make no mistake about that
[2:36:47.860 --> 2:36:53.300]  but anyways let's go ahead and go to uh let's go to mr parker
[2:36:53.300 --> 2:36:56.580]  shon parker might want to try to keep his soul or at least
[2:36:56.580 --> 2:37:00.820]  hedge's bets here it is that thought process was all about
[2:37:00.820 --> 2:37:04.340]  how do we consume as much of your time
[2:37:04.340 --> 2:37:09.220]  and conscious attention as possible and that means that we need to sort of
[2:37:09.220 --> 2:37:12.100]  give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while
[2:37:12.100 --> 2:37:17.060]  um because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever
[2:37:17.060 --> 2:37:19.860]  and that's going to get you to contribute more content
[2:37:19.860 --> 2:37:23.620]  and that's going to get you you know more likes and comments and it's a it's a
[2:37:23.620 --> 2:37:26.500]  valid it's a social validation feedback loop
[2:37:26.500 --> 2:37:29.860]  that that it's like uh i mean it's exactly the kind of thing
[2:37:29.860 --> 2:37:34.020]  that a that a hacker like myself would come up with because you're exploiting
[2:37:34.020 --> 2:37:38.180]  a vulnerability in in human psychology
[2:37:38.180 --> 2:37:42.900]  and i just i think that we you know we the inventors
[2:37:42.900 --> 2:37:47.220]  creators you know and it's it's me it's mark it's
[2:37:47.220 --> 2:37:50.820]  the you know kevin sisterman instagram it's all of these people
[2:37:50.820 --> 2:37:59.860]  um understood this consciously and we did it anyway
[2:37:59.860 --> 2:38:03.700]  much much worse than that of course but remember now you've got
[2:38:03.700 --> 2:38:06.980]  a decade or more of people totally bathed in this
[2:38:06.980 --> 2:38:09.700]  and you wonder why they look like whacked out zombies and don't care how
[2:38:09.700 --> 2:38:14.660]  they look and are totally insane because they got hit
[2:38:14.660 --> 2:38:20.740]  with a psychological warfare weapon now above that there's another guild
[2:38:20.740 --> 2:38:24.500]  of the total zombies above them who kind of get it
[2:38:24.500 --> 2:38:27.700]  and go we don't care we've been screwed over we like it we're going to screw you
[2:38:27.700 --> 2:38:31.460]  over and then they try to mimic the the bosses above them and that's how
[2:38:31.460 --> 2:38:34.340]  psychopaths work so they're not really
[2:38:34.340 --> 2:38:37.540]  genetic psychopaths but they're they're trying to learn
[2:38:37.540 --> 2:38:40.340]  they're mimicking
[2:38:41.860 --> 2:38:48.100]  i can't believe our users trust us dumb ethers
[2:38:48.100 --> 2:38:50.740]  because if you're going to hurt people you might as well have to stand for them
[2:38:50.740 --> 2:38:56.020]  and it's all about him it's all about me it's all about
[2:38:56.020 --> 2:38:58.820]  son ever
[2:38:59.620 --> 2:39:02.740]  he's smart like google he hadn't done the super censoring yet
[2:39:02.740 --> 2:39:06.580]  like twitter is just all out they don't get they're going to destroy themselves
[2:39:06.580 --> 2:39:10.020]  no no no you want to be the last big group that doesn't get hit with any trust
[2:39:10.020 --> 2:39:13.220]  stuff and then you can censor everybody you want to be the last
[2:39:13.220 --> 2:39:18.500]  that's the whole plan the last humanoid merging with the great machine
[2:39:18.500 --> 2:39:21.540]  and then everything else on the planet is just you'll take like a maybe
[2:39:21.540 --> 2:39:26.340]  a week once you turn nanobots loose the chew everything up and use it for fuel
[2:39:26.340 --> 2:39:29.780]  for the big space warp jumps because obviously you got to conquer the universe
[2:39:29.780 --> 2:39:32.340]  once you've conquered earth i mean that's the and by the way
[2:39:32.340 --> 2:39:36.100]  they all write that the minute they merge the machine
[2:39:36.100 --> 2:39:40.340]  that they're going to turn on the big the big city constructors they'll have
[2:39:40.340 --> 2:39:44.580]  soon oh look we we built new city blocks in just a month and it'll be in days and
[2:39:44.580 --> 2:39:47.060]  weeks and hours as long as the raw material
[2:39:47.060 --> 2:39:50.900]  gets delivered up by the driverless cars and the big and the big
[2:39:50.900 --> 2:39:54.100]  city printing machine and then once they merge the machine
[2:39:54.100 --> 2:39:57.220]  they'll try to cut each other off wipe the others out and then go
[2:39:57.220 --> 2:40:05.620]  launch operation everything in days whole earth chewed up
[2:40:05.620 --> 2:40:12.100]  fed in blast off
[2:40:12.100 --> 2:40:16.660]  and incoming ai psychopath driven
[2:40:16.660 --> 2:40:21.220]  consciousness coming into the universe and i mean that's obviously satan's plan
[2:40:21.220 --> 2:40:24.980]  he don't think he's tried this before think a few times
[2:40:24.980 --> 2:40:32.020]  show and what's crazy is i'd have dreams about this 20 30 years ago 25 years
[2:40:32.020 --> 2:40:34.820]  ago and i thought man these would be great science fiction books and then i'm
[2:40:34.820 --> 2:40:38.180]  like reading Kurzweil and reading all these and they're going this is what
[2:40:38.180 --> 2:40:41.540]  we're going to do and you're like oh my god

[2:40:46.340 --> 2:40:49.300]  but don't you think god that created us would warn us of this

[2:46:08.900 --> 2:46:13.860]  in the face of their wannabe dictatorship being a conservative a
[2:46:13.860 --> 2:46:17.060]  nationalist a libertarian or simply a free speech
[2:46:17.060 --> 2:46:23.140]  advocate is truly the counterculture the real punk rock is being a patriot

[2:46:27.860 --> 2:46:31.460]  tolerant modern liberalism is a counterfeit of
[2:46:31.460 --> 2:46:36.100]  thomas geverson's classical liberalism they are the anti-liberal

[2:46:55.540 --> 2:47:06.500]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:17.940 --> 2:47:21.940]  i mean think about how amazing it is alex jones for back live
[2:47:21.940 --> 2:47:25.780]  that the former head of facebook says he started it to exploit you
[2:47:25.780 --> 2:47:30.180]  and use your weaknesses to manipulate your dopamine levels
[2:47:31.620 --> 2:47:34.340]  i mean imagine if we went with a program where when you post articles
[2:47:34.340 --> 2:47:37.380]  against the globalists or promote human liberty little stars go
[2:47:37.380 --> 2:47:40.580]  being good job like you want a video game
[2:47:40.580 --> 2:47:43.220]  so that's what they make facebook like and then you got a like and you got a
[2:47:43.220 --> 2:47:46.020]  friend it's like you're still in junior high trying to
[2:47:46.020 --> 2:47:49.380]  be cool it's all about arrested development
[2:47:49.380 --> 2:47:53.620]  you don't just think shon parker and uh mark zuckerberg and all these guys just
[2:47:53.620 --> 2:47:57.140]  suddenly came up with all this everything for a hundred years is all
[2:47:57.140 --> 2:48:01.780]  declassified it's been about arresting development keeping
[2:48:01.780 --> 2:48:05.380]  you like a teenager so you feel insecure and never grow up
[2:48:05.380 --> 2:48:08.740]  and go i don't care about hollywood i don't care about politicians i don't care
[2:48:08.740 --> 2:48:12.500]  about some guy acting cool
[2:48:12.500 --> 2:48:15.380]  they want to keep you like insecure and nervous and real
[2:48:15.380 --> 2:48:18.740]  i'll be whatever group you say i'll be liberal i'll be whatever
[2:48:18.740 --> 2:48:22.260]  it's just like the christian church has been manipulated to make people all
[2:48:22.260 --> 2:48:26.660]  upset and neurotic it's the same thing and i just take the grandkids of people
[2:48:26.660 --> 2:48:30.340]  and the children of people that were like super anal retentive christians you
[2:48:30.340 --> 2:48:33.220]  know that thought going to the bathroom was a sin or whatever
[2:48:33.220 --> 2:48:38.260]  literally and just it's the new political correctness
[2:48:38.900 --> 2:48:43.700]  and you try to go to them and say facebook admits it's
[2:48:43.700 --> 2:48:47.700]  trying to keep you poor and stupid and trying to make you depressed
[2:48:47.700 --> 2:48:51.540]  just like hillary said in the wiki legend said these stupid baristas and
[2:48:51.540 --> 2:48:55.860]  liberal scum are you they're so pathetic just look at it
[2:48:55.860 --> 2:48:59.620]  crap we need to keep them in the dark keep pathetic what do we do
[2:48:59.620 --> 2:49:03.700]  well our top professor says just expand culture war
[2:49:03.700 --> 2:49:11.460]  and that's what you see you don't like obama here you're in the kkk
[2:49:11.460 --> 2:49:15.300]  but we rejected hillary
[2:49:15.300 --> 2:49:18.500]  i mean look at the establishment thought
[2:49:18.500 --> 2:49:26.020]  they could run a witch in action a witch in optics
[2:49:26.660 --> 2:49:30.660]  and now they run fake polls against trump constantly it's the same bs
[2:49:30.660 --> 2:49:37.700]  over and over and over and over again but remember for people that still bought
[2:49:37.700 --> 2:49:41.540]  the koolaid for those of us that are awake it gets
[2:49:41.540 --> 2:49:44.820]  more ridiculous but for those under it they're like there's nazis everywhere
[2:49:44.820 --> 2:49:48.180]  they're killing us oh my gosh we're all dead
[2:49:48.180 --> 2:49:52.580]  i mean they are really stop markets up jobs are coming back
[2:49:52.580 --> 2:49:56.660]  oh no no stop it
[2:49:57.300 --> 2:50:04.180]  just don't leave her alone because they have no power they live vicariously
[2:50:04.180 --> 2:50:08.100]  i see these news articles they write about me all the time
[2:50:08.180 --> 2:50:12.260]  and they're like tattling on me to like make up stuff i didn't do or twist it
[2:50:12.260 --> 2:50:15.860]  and go look jones did this someone sue him
[2:50:15.860 --> 2:50:21.540]  someone arrest him someone kill him but they don't ever do it themselves
[2:50:21.540 --> 2:50:26.100]  they always just cry like babies and go yeah
[2:50:26.100 --> 2:50:31.220]  and you you want to laugh at them and i do laugh at them
[2:50:31.220 --> 2:50:34.100]  but it's not funny
[2:50:35.220 --> 2:50:39.780]  they know psychology they have created these people
[2:50:39.780 --> 2:50:43.060]  and you can go to them and say here's where they admit they created you
[2:50:43.060 --> 2:50:46.100]  i'd like you to be for oh shut up it's not showing off whatever
[2:50:46.100 --> 2:50:48.900]  whatever shut up
[2:50:51.460 --> 2:50:55.780]  so here is another club john parker god only knows what
[2:50:55.780 --> 2:50:59.220]  is going to do to our children well they already know what they've done
[2:50:59.220 --> 2:51:03.620]  disassociative low iqs unable to communicate
[2:51:03.620 --> 2:51:09.220]  it's called autism a lot of it's chemical but a lot of it's also
[2:51:09.220 --> 2:51:13.860]  cultural it's lack of communication we are
[2:51:13.860 --> 2:51:17.700]  well you you you give babies the bad formula their brains are a third smaller
[2:51:17.700 --> 2:51:21.380]  they didn't get the love they were sat in front of a television
[2:51:21.380 --> 2:51:26.500]  they're just receivers they're not transmitters they're androids
[2:51:26.500 --> 2:51:29.940]  they're pretty close to solace
[2:51:33.300 --> 2:51:37.140]  and they've got that mentally ill confidence though
[2:51:37.140 --> 2:51:40.820]  defense mechanisms they're just like and but if you try to give it there then
[2:51:40.820 --> 2:51:43.540]  if you try to get them out of it shut up i know what i'm doing i'll play video
[2:51:43.540 --> 2:51:47.860]  games all day and i'll want to all repeat jokes i saw on television
[2:51:47.860 --> 2:51:53.220]  and then and they're just getting them ready when the bioweapon gets
[2:51:53.220 --> 2:51:56.900]  released or the chemical weapons of the
[2:51:56.900 --> 2:52:00.420]  they already released the chemical weapons it's just the binary weapons
[2:52:00.420 --> 2:52:03.940]  so that nobody gets too freaked out you know when they bait a test and a 10
[2:52:03.940 --> 2:52:08.420]  percent of your your country gets killed then it's 80 percent next and then
[2:52:08.420 --> 2:52:11.620]  they're gonna kind of get on you know the transmission lines then it'll be
[2:52:11.620 --> 2:52:14.740]  right to your head just say they already have that they'll be like
[2:52:14.740 --> 2:52:18.420]  we did it here's the plan come accept total control and
[2:52:18.420 --> 2:52:21.940]  plug into the main system or you're dead it's gonna be just like tron
[2:52:21.940 --> 2:52:25.700]  i mean like here in the central system
[2:52:25.700 --> 2:52:29.620]  childhood's in you can have steak five times a day into whatever you want
[2:52:29.620 --> 2:52:34.260]  but your consciousness is plugged into this i'm taking you over
[2:52:34.260 --> 2:52:37.700]  because you keep asking how the computer is going to become
[2:52:37.700 --> 2:52:42.740]  truly conscious and god well it's called satan you're gonna plug your ass into it
[2:52:42.740 --> 2:52:46.980]  and then we're gonna take your body
[2:52:47.460 --> 2:52:51.780]  and we're gonna burn it up and we're gonna shoot
[2:52:52.260 --> 2:52:58.980]  the ashes and the gas into the atmosphere you see and then pretend
[2:52:58.980 --> 2:53:02.100]  that you never had a soul because that's really the trick
[2:53:02.100 --> 2:53:07.380]  getting the humans from birth to try to fool the soul
[2:53:07.380 --> 2:53:12.260]  from birth well from the embryonic stage through birth
[2:53:12.260 --> 2:53:16.580]  into the matrix to believe that the false system
[2:53:16.580 --> 2:53:23.780]  is creation to then give your soul to it in an assembly line fashion
[2:53:23.780 --> 2:53:30.020]  that's really what they're looking for
[2:53:34.020 --> 2:53:39.220]  oh souls never tasted so good
[2:53:42.900 --> 2:53:45.620]  but it's kind of like the cheesy pirates of the caribbean and the curse of the
[2:53:45.620 --> 2:53:49.220]  black pearl you can drink all the wine you want you
[2:53:49.220 --> 2:53:52.740]  can drink all the blood you want but you're never going to be human
[2:53:52.740 --> 2:53:55.060]  zooker
[2:53:56.820 --> 2:54:01.620]  you're just a shade
[2:54:03.060 --> 2:54:08.500]  for something else to stick its big ugly stinky arm into our dimension
[2:54:08.500 --> 2:54:12.340]  and try to tear up as much pretty stuff as you can because you know
[2:54:12.340 --> 2:54:20.980]  you're ugly and you're stinky and you're a loser you're a big pile of pus
[2:54:20.980 --> 2:54:25.940]  and you know we know and you can't stand it
[2:54:25.940 --> 2:54:29.620]  but i know on the left the globalists the satanist brag they say hey
[2:54:29.620 --> 2:54:32.740]  jones they even said this in news articles they go jones you keep trying
[2:54:32.740 --> 2:54:36.900]  we got your kids we're gonna get your guns
[2:54:37.380 --> 2:54:42.900]  oh yeah but see that's just them putting on a face of
[2:54:42.900 --> 2:54:45.620]  confidence they don't really have any emotions
[2:54:45.620 --> 2:54:48.740]  you have to remember that unless they're doing bad things so it's it's all
[2:54:48.740 --> 2:54:52.180]  effect similarly okay because it's fake
[2:54:52.180 --> 2:54:56.180]  why is kevin spacey a good actor playing psychopaths because he is an actor
[2:54:56.180 --> 2:54:59.940]  everything is little affects he's learned to put on to you
[2:54:59.940 --> 2:55:05.380]  to try to lure you in see but that's all there is
[2:55:05.460 --> 2:55:09.140]  and can you imagine just this dull thing that doesn't know art literature
[2:55:09.140 --> 2:55:11.940]  culture god it's like really cold and freaked out
[2:55:11.940 --> 2:55:17.700]  and all it knows is it seems alive when it's got a 10 year old been over
[2:55:17.700 --> 2:55:21.620]  crying for mommy like like the the only time we understand this the only time
[2:55:21.620 --> 2:55:25.300]  they're alive is when they're hurting you so you go why does everything they do
[2:55:25.300 --> 2:55:31.540]  hurt us lower IQ poisonous because they're fallen
[2:55:31.540 --> 2:55:36.660]  they only resonate with death and ugliness
[2:55:38.020 --> 2:55:43.140]  they're so happy when they got a toddler hanging up by their toes
[2:55:43.140 --> 2:55:47.700]  now let's uh go ahead and go back to uh mr parker
[2:55:47.700 --> 2:55:51.940]  almost he's enjoying it now we knew and we did it he's
[2:55:51.940 --> 2:55:55.860]  it's kind of like it's kind of like whenever we saw uh gruber on tv only
[2:55:55.860 --> 2:56:02.500]  thank god americans are so stupid thank god they have no attention spanish
[2:56:02.500 --> 2:56:06.420]  and the other professors are going so sir tell us how you lie
[2:56:06.420 --> 2:56:10.820]  you're so sexy oh i'm just like oh they're fawning here it is
[2:56:10.820 --> 2:56:15.780]  and then they would say they would say no no no no i value
[2:56:15.780 --> 2:56:19.380]  my real-life interactions i value the moment i value
[2:56:19.380 --> 2:56:23.300]  presence and i value intimacy and i would say well you're a conscientious
[2:56:23.300 --> 2:56:27.060]  objector if that's okay you don't have to participate but you know we'll get
[2:56:27.060 --> 2:56:32.740]  to eventually and and and like i don't know if i really
[2:56:32.740 --> 2:56:38.180]  understood the consequences of what i was saying
[2:56:38.180 --> 2:56:42.180]  because it the the unintended consequences of
[2:56:42.180 --> 2:56:46.740]  of of a network when it grows to a billion or two billion people
[2:56:46.740 --> 2:56:50.500]  and it and it began it it literally changes
[2:56:50.500 --> 2:56:55.540]  your relationship with society that's cancer each other with
[2:56:55.540 --> 2:57:00.420]  yeah you know it it it probably interferes with productivity in weird
[2:57:00.420 --> 2:57:03.620]  ways it yeah it kills you god only knows what it's doing to
[2:57:03.620 --> 2:57:09.700]  to our children's brains um you know anxiety is a huge problem now
[2:57:09.700 --> 2:57:13.700]  in of course i'm gonna come back with the rest of the next segment

[2:57:18.420 --> 2:57:20.900]  on prozac
[2:57:22.260 --> 2:57:27.220]  maybe parker's a good guy but he's a smart guy i mean he obviously knows right
[2:57:27.220 --> 2:57:30.100]  but maybe that's why he was kicked out of the company he helped create
[2:57:30.100 --> 2:57:34.900]  because he isn't fully committed to total human exterminism

[2:59:54.420 --> 3:00:16.340]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[3:00:16.340 --> 3:00:21.780]  live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones
[3:00:21.780 --> 3:00:26.340]  you know i didn't drop the ball but i really should have
[3:00:26.340 --> 3:00:32.100]  led the broadcast today with former facebook president meds they are
[3:00:32.100 --> 3:00:35.540]  targeting your weaknesses and trying to control your life and they've done a
[3:00:35.540 --> 3:00:40.020]  great job disrupting society but see he's there wondering
[3:00:40.020 --> 3:00:43.300]  why they all did it he was put in that position
[3:00:43.300 --> 3:00:46.900]  he was then removed because he didn't like going along with it
[3:00:46.900 --> 3:00:50.740]  i'm at shon parker it's in all the white papers mr parker if you don't know
[3:00:50.740 --> 3:00:54.340]  about him and i'm sure you do you're a smart guy
[3:00:54.340 --> 3:00:57.940]  this is all a plan to make people disassociative not have personalities
[3:00:57.940 --> 3:01:02.420]  not have relationships to atomize the population it's in your own documents
[3:01:02.420 --> 3:01:06.340]  not just what you're saying now i'm glad you're warning people but why not bring
[3:01:06.340 --> 3:01:09.940]  up the facebook documents that came out this
[3:01:09.940 --> 3:01:14.660]  year elaborating on what you're just confirming
[3:01:14.660 --> 3:01:19.860]  but observation is true science i don't need to hear what you say to know it's
[3:01:19.860 --> 3:01:23.620]  true i can observe the results in all of it is
[3:01:23.620 --> 3:01:28.420]  bad unless you're getting ready for people to be replaced
[3:01:28.420 --> 3:01:34.980]  by machines planned obsolescence has a new meaning
[3:01:34.980 --> 3:01:38.820]  when it comes to people and why the future
[3:01:38.820 --> 3:01:43.380]  doesn't need us the decision mr parker was made before you were born
[3:01:43.380 --> 3:01:46.900]  to carry out this operation
[3:01:46.900 --> 3:01:50.820]  but i'm glad you're starting to get panicked like elon musk and others that
[3:01:50.820 --> 3:01:55.940]  have a soul because if you have a trajectory that's
[3:01:55.940 --> 3:02:00.820]  meant to be anti-human do you really trust the psychopaths that
[3:02:00.820 --> 3:02:05.460]  are running things to even deliver they're going to take your billions
[3:02:05.460 --> 3:02:09.700]  you're not going to get it you're going to be killed
[3:02:10.900 --> 3:02:14.580]  once they've got their systems plugged in which they're close to
[3:02:14.580 --> 3:02:18.580]  things are going to move lightning speed
[3:02:18.740 --> 3:02:22.020]  and you know i'm not afraid because i've just got to get my
[3:02:22.020 --> 3:02:25.220]  relationship with god right
[3:02:26.980 --> 3:02:33.700]  that's what really counts but i know i'm right because i'm going off what they
[3:02:33.700 --> 3:02:36.980]  said they were writing this stuff 50 years ago
[3:02:36.980 --> 3:02:41.140]  they they're now saying on tv but that's why i'm so
[3:02:41.140 --> 3:02:44.100]  people keep saying jones how do you keep being proven right how do you know
[3:02:44.100 --> 3:02:48.100]  this are you one of them one of them
[3:02:52.100 --> 3:02:57.860]  they only tried to hire me repeatedly because they buy everybody up
[3:02:57.860 --> 3:03:02.420]  most people that know what's going on join them
[3:03:02.420 --> 3:03:05.780]  they think i'm a dumbass because i'm not a psychopath and don't want to feed on
[3:03:05.780 --> 3:03:10.180]  you and don't get off on how stupid people are
[3:03:10.180 --> 3:03:13.540]  that's what's so frustrating to the left and all the globalist
[3:03:13.540 --> 3:03:17.540]  and the minions most of you are total minions of this and you still think
[3:03:17.540 --> 3:03:20.580]  you're part of it like you got a seat at the table because you want to belong
[3:03:20.580 --> 3:03:24.820]  because you have arrested development let's let's play this clip here it is
[3:03:24.820 --> 3:03:29.620]  and then they would say they would say no no no no i value
[3:03:29.620 --> 3:03:33.140]  my real-life interactions i value the moment i value
[3:03:33.140 --> 3:03:36.980]  presence and i value intimacy and i would say well you're a conscientious
[3:03:36.980 --> 3:03:40.820]  subjector that's okay you don't have to participate but you know we'll get to
[3:03:40.820 --> 3:03:46.260]  eventually and and and like i don't know if i really
[3:03:46.260 --> 3:03:51.060]  understood the consequences of what i was saying
[3:03:51.060 --> 3:03:55.780]  this is too good because it the unintended consequences of
[3:03:55.780 --> 3:04:00.340]  of a of a network when it grows to a billion or two billion people
[3:04:00.340 --> 3:04:04.020]  and it and it began it literally changes
[3:04:04.020 --> 3:04:09.140]  your relationship with society with each other with
[3:04:09.140 --> 3:04:14.580]  you know it it it probably interferes with productivity in weird ways
[3:04:14.580 --> 3:04:19.140]  it god only knows what it's doing to to our children's brains
[3:04:19.140 --> 3:04:23.300]  um you know anxiety is a huge problem now
[3:04:23.300 --> 3:04:26.660]  in of course anxiety was always a big problem in high school who wasn't to
[3:04:26.660 --> 3:04:30.900]  have anxiety in high school but it the the surveys that have been going on
[3:04:30.900 --> 3:04:34.020]  for years are showing a huge rise in anxiety amongst
[3:04:34.020 --> 3:04:40.180]  high school kids and younger and and you know you have to wonder if
[3:04:40.180 --> 3:04:47.620]  there isn't some you know if the if the thought process
[3:04:47.620 --> 3:04:51.540]  that went into building these applications facebook being the first
[3:04:51.540 --> 3:04:55.060]  we're gonna come right back to really understand it you go to infowarstore.com

[3:05:45.060 --> 3:05:48.260]  when you spread the links the articles and buy products from us and then we
[3:05:48.260 --> 3:05:59.780]  commit rampage against the enemy totally
[3:06:09.860 --> 3:06:15.780]  once humans dreamed of being gods
[3:06:15.780 --> 3:06:18.740]  then
[3:06:20.900 --> 3:06:26.660]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the
[3:06:26.660 --> 3:06:31.460]  front lines of the info war and my sternum is just taken over right
[3:06:31.460 --> 3:06:35.700]  now i've been playing all day these intriguing clips
[3:06:35.700 --> 3:06:38.020]  now i'm gonna play more the interview this sunday i'm gonna really get into
[3:06:38.020 --> 3:06:42.340]  this uh of shon parkard
[3:06:42.340 --> 3:06:46.660]  former president of facebook saying it's destroying productivity it's
[3:06:46.660 --> 3:06:49.460]  destroying lives it's it's wrecking everything but
[3:06:49.460 --> 3:06:54.020]  don't worry we're gonna have solutions for the crisis
[3:06:54.020 --> 3:06:57.060]  that's the next part of the business because you've always got to have the
[3:06:57.060 --> 3:07:00.180]  good guys now that come in and explain we
[3:07:00.180 --> 3:07:03.780]  didn't know what we were doing we've got things to mitigate
[3:07:03.780 --> 3:07:07.700]  what happened with what we've all just been through with facebook and the rest
[3:07:07.700 --> 3:07:10.820]  of it but he starts saying i wonder if they
[3:07:10.820 --> 3:07:17.140]  knew what they were doing so he's talking to the public like their children
[3:07:17.140 --> 3:07:22.580]  i guess in a smart way to try to get them to realize what's happened to them
[3:07:22.580 --> 3:07:25.620]  wanting to be liked wanting to be in the cool club wanting to be in the
[3:07:25.620 --> 3:07:29.780]  arrested development zone and then going out having all these
[3:07:29.780 --> 3:07:33.380]  imaginary friends and as long as you were nothing but purely
[3:07:33.380 --> 3:07:36.980]  positive why you might get a whole bunch of
[3:07:36.980 --> 3:07:40.180]  friends but you gave up your real identity and then they
[3:07:40.180 --> 3:07:43.300]  weren't even real friends most of them they were bots
[3:07:43.300 --> 3:07:47.220]  they were sock puppets they were lies and they were there to actually maneuver
[3:07:47.220 --> 3:07:50.260]  you ever so slowly into being more isolated
[3:07:50.260 --> 3:07:54.980]  more alone only spending all your time with them
[3:07:54.980 --> 3:07:58.660]  now we've used facebook to go inject information warfare
[3:07:58.660 --> 3:08:02.420]  to expose what's going on to try to reach out to people
[3:08:02.420 --> 3:08:06.020]  that's why google facebook twitter youtube they're all saying in congressional
[3:08:06.020 --> 3:08:11.620]  hearings the director of operations at twitter
[3:08:11.620 --> 3:08:15.940]  the number two guy in the company says did you see what
[3:08:15.940 --> 3:08:19.220]  info wars did at lunch yes sir we caught it and we
[3:08:19.220 --> 3:08:23.300]  we deleted it we'll do better job next time
[3:08:23.300 --> 3:08:26.820]  says congressman quickly
[3:08:27.460 --> 3:08:32.740]  i'm not kidding this shows how vulnerable these jerks are
[3:08:32.740 --> 3:08:36.740]  if america and the world wakes up to these scams it's over
[3:08:36.740 --> 3:08:40.980]  and i think genuinely sean parker because he's been
[3:08:40.980 --> 3:08:43.940]  kicked out of a lot of the things he helped fund and create
[3:08:43.940 --> 3:08:47.380]  nabster this you name it is legitimately
[3:08:47.380 --> 3:08:51.220]  not anti-human and is really trying to warn people i think overall here
[3:08:51.220 --> 3:08:54.180]  but there's still a little bit of you know snickering about it going on
[3:08:54.180 --> 3:08:57.540]  that's the duality of man
[3:08:59.060 --> 3:09:02.420]  but anybody that thinks you turn on systems like this
[3:09:02.420 --> 3:09:06.180]  and then you in the end end up winning because you screw over a bunch of other
[3:09:06.180 --> 3:09:09.300]  people it's going to blow back on you and that's why globalists
[3:09:09.300 --> 3:09:14.180]  no one in the uu has kids now in the uu government
[3:09:14.180 --> 3:09:16.820]  because they're so selfish but they're also know
[3:09:16.820 --> 3:09:22.580]  they've made a deal to party and eat steak with this eugenics operation
[3:09:22.580 --> 3:09:29.460]  and that they're riding an express elevator to hell
[3:09:29.460 --> 3:09:32.100]  and a lot of them do it through fear too it's not just status they're like
[3:09:32.100 --> 3:09:35.540]  this is really scary and i'm smart and i've been letting on it so i'm going to
[3:09:35.540 --> 3:09:41.220]  go along with it and try to position myself to you know do better
[3:09:41.220 --> 3:09:43.940]  feel like if aliens showed up and said we're going to kill everybody in 10
[3:09:43.940 --> 3:09:47.780]  years but work with us you can live for 10 years
[3:09:47.780 --> 3:09:50.740]  but your kids can't go into the future and we're going to kill all of you but
[3:09:50.740 --> 3:09:56.020]  just go have fun and we'll make you a rock star that's not fun
[3:09:56.020 --> 3:09:59.700]  and that's basically what this is it's psychopaths that now have tools
[3:09:59.700 --> 3:10:03.380]  and sociopaths and camp followers and insecure people below them
[3:10:03.380 --> 3:10:07.060]  that will do anything for substance anything for power
[3:10:07.060 --> 3:10:11.860]  anything to feel like they're finally winners
[3:10:12.420 --> 3:10:16.340]  and it's all a lie it's all done not to advance humanity
[3:10:16.340 --> 3:10:19.700]  but to quote mr parker
[3:10:20.980 --> 3:10:26.980]  exploit our weaknesses and make us weaker hey we're running the thing that
[3:10:26.980 --> 3:10:31.300]  dumb efforts use zuckerberg's term and it's meant to exploit you
[3:10:31.300 --> 3:10:34.980]  and make you weaker and make you desperate and alone just like hillary
[3:10:34.980 --> 3:10:39.300]  in the wiki league says i want them in the dark cold and alone
[3:10:39.300 --> 3:10:44.180]  i want our constituents in the dark
[3:10:44.820 --> 3:10:52.660]  wow i want them in the dark i want them desperate
[3:10:52.660 --> 3:10:58.260]  i want our species to go the next level i want us to have incredible
[3:10:58.260 --> 3:11:00.580]  adventures i want my progeny to be incredibly
[3:11:00.580 --> 3:11:04.740]  and yours together i'm a lover
[3:11:05.060 --> 3:11:10.100]  but not these people they are evil i'm gonna get my concern which is take on
[3:11:10.100 --> 3:11:12.020]  this but let's finish up with the end of what parker
[3:11:12.020 --> 3:11:15.860]  was saying here it is the surveys that have been going on for years are
[3:11:15.860 --> 3:11:19.700]  showing huge rise in anxiety amongst high school kids
[3:11:19.700 --> 3:11:24.580]  and younger and and you know you have to wonder if
[3:11:24.580 --> 3:11:31.940]  there isn't some you know if the if the thought process
[3:11:31.940 --> 3:11:36.020]  that went into building these applications facebook being the first
[3:11:36.020 --> 3:11:40.420]  of them to really understand it that thought process was all about
[3:11:40.420 --> 3:11:47.140]  how do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible
[3:11:47.140 --> 3:11:50.420]  now see he signed a non-disclosure agreement
[3:11:50.420 --> 3:11:52.500]  so he's only saying hey we might want to look at this but it's in all the
[3:11:52.500 --> 3:11:58.260]  documents that came out this year it's way beyond what the
[3:11:58.260 --> 3:12:01.860]  guardian said facebook told advertisers to identify teens feeling insecure and
[3:12:01.860 --> 3:12:05.700]  worthless they magnify that to literally take control and
[3:12:05.700 --> 3:12:09.620]  hack their brain and then turn them into a
[3:12:09.620 --> 3:12:13.460]  operative in your house you don't just think they want to turn on your
[3:12:13.460 --> 3:12:17.620]  television and record you or use a smart photo track you
[3:12:17.620 --> 3:12:23.380]  or the horizon router they want you they want control
[3:12:23.380 --> 3:12:26.980]  and they're all battling with each other for who gets control of the final
[3:12:26.980 --> 3:12:30.580]  interface which one will merge with in their own words and then they're
[3:12:30.580 --> 3:12:34.260]  going to exterminate everybody else because we're the fallen species
[3:12:34.260 --> 3:12:37.780]  they're really fallen they're going to transcend us you have to understand
[3:12:37.780 --> 3:12:40.580]  so my concern was you got a lot to cover today but i wanted to get your
[3:12:40.580 --> 3:12:44.180]  take on this why do you think so many people inside the technocracy from
[3:12:44.180 --> 3:12:47.940]  donald brazil to shon parker speaking out are they finally
[3:12:47.940 --> 3:12:50.820]  realizing the end game of the new world order is total human
[3:12:50.820 --> 3:12:54.660]  exterminism well i mean dosterhaus
[3:12:54.660 --> 3:12:58.020]  dosterhaus district office as well as um
[3:12:58.020 --> 3:13:01.860]  many other people the human need to confess
[3:13:01.860 --> 3:13:06.340]  is what we're dealing with right now unless you're a pure social path
[3:13:06.340 --> 3:13:09.780]  you need to confess and that's what we're right now
[3:13:09.780 --> 3:13:12.980]  people are confessing what is really going on
[3:13:12.980 --> 3:13:17.460]  because a ordinary human being can't live without like donald brazil
[3:13:17.460 --> 3:13:22.900]  vindicated our reporting on hillary's health have you talked about that yet
[3:13:22.900 --> 3:13:26.900]  very very important now it's big i think you're internal mic so i'm not your
[3:13:26.900 --> 3:13:29.940]  external uh we can barely hear you but you're right
[3:13:29.940 --> 3:13:32.340]  all these victories of what you've covered what i've covered what we've been
[3:13:32.340 --> 3:13:35.780]  demonized for mic started with alex jones they made up the lie that
[3:13:35.780 --> 3:13:39.140]  hillary was sick she looks like she'd been run over by cars she's falling down
[3:13:39.140 --> 3:13:42.180]  the street uh you're absolutely right mic i mean it's
[3:13:42.180 --> 3:13:46.180]  just crazy what's going to happen is everything we cover gets vindicated
[3:13:46.180 --> 3:13:49.620]  and accelerates what are they going to do

[3:14:49.300 --> 3:14:52.980]  new generations because of what they call over population or create new cast
[3:14:52.980 --> 3:14:58.340]  systems uh where the uh older uh
[3:14:58.340 --> 3:15:02.340]  thomas sapiens sapiens create systems against the younger ones

[3:15:15.220 --> 3:15:20.020]  so-called eternal life would be quite a quite a sin against humanity and
[3:15:20.020 --> 3:15:22.980]  death is just like birth it's all part of the process
[3:15:22.980 --> 3:15:30.260]  it equalizes us all but uh i would like to see us still have longer
[3:15:30.260 --> 3:15:34.420]  better lives and be able to mature more spiritually

[3:20:45.220 --> 3:20:48.100]  programming control it's all admitted and as mike
[3:20:48.100 --> 3:20:52.420]  sternovich really said very well earlier despite the fact his audio was
[3:20:52.420 --> 3:20:57.460]  hammered this is the need to confess if you have a soul
[3:20:57.460 --> 3:21:01.860]  if you're not a psychopath you realize we're all connected this is not a good
[3:21:01.860 --> 3:21:05.300]  idea this is not good okay gave you some
[3:21:05.300 --> 3:21:08.260]  temporary power how are those billions doing for you
[3:21:08.260 --> 3:21:11.860]  not making you happy not as happy as you were telling the truth exactly
[3:21:11.860 --> 3:21:16.260]  nothing wrong with wealth as long as it wasn't stolen and empowers other
[3:21:16.260 --> 3:21:19.220]  we haven't limited well soon with the technology and free energy and all this
[3:21:19.220 --> 3:21:21.460]  crap it's going to be about good and evil we're
[3:21:21.460 --> 3:21:25.060]  going to find out it's about where we stand has the value
[3:21:25.060 --> 3:21:28.580]  and what are the globalists want they want your mind they want you to think
[3:21:28.580 --> 3:21:31.700]  like they do they want you to be degenerate he mentioned it i should
[3:21:31.700 --> 3:21:34.500]  have led the show with it mike sternovich is absolutely right
[3:21:34.500 --> 3:21:38.820]  donald brazil now saying investigate seth rich how sensational
[3:21:38.820 --> 3:21:42.900]  we've gone from the dnc saying nobody hurt him he you know he got killed but
[3:21:42.900 --> 3:21:45.940]  it's not political and don't try to investigate you're a bad guy
[3:21:45.940 --> 3:21:49.140]  to the head of the dnc saying i feared for my life and now
[3:21:49.140 --> 3:21:53.620]  it needs to be investigated she is telling you what happened
[3:21:53.620 --> 3:21:57.300]  we are so close to the muller hillary crime syndicate
[3:21:57.300 --> 3:22:01.540]  going down and if i wanted to investigate who hired the hit team that took
[3:22:01.540 --> 3:22:06.180]  out seth rich in dc i'd start with robert muller
[3:22:06.180 --> 3:22:11.060]  that's right you heard me said robert muller here's the clip
[3:22:11.060 --> 3:22:16.020]  were the russians involved in your opinion i know this hadn't been resolved
[3:22:16.020 --> 3:22:20.820]  yet in seth rich's death yes no i don't know
[3:22:20.820 --> 3:22:25.060]  i don't know i never i'm not part of the investigative team but i can tell you
[3:22:25.060 --> 3:22:27.540]  this much and thank you for asking about seth
[3:22:27.540 --> 3:22:31.860]  he was my child i loved him he worked in the vote and rights division i was the
[3:22:31.860 --> 3:22:36.900]  i was the vice chair over that division uh he was one of two staff people i
[3:22:36.900 --> 3:22:40.340]  love him i miss him he was a patriot and i hope
[3:22:40.340 --> 3:22:44.020]  to god we find out who murdered seth rich you wrote in the book you feel
[3:22:44.020 --> 3:22:49.780]  responsible for his death i because he was my child
[3:22:49.780 --> 3:22:53.380]  okay i understand and make me cry i'm sorry i didn't mean i don't mean to do
[3:22:53.380 --> 3:22:56.900]  my child let me just say y'all don't lie 10th
[3:22:56.900 --> 3:23:00.420]  yeah he was my child mark i have been in politics
[3:23:00.420 --> 3:23:05.220]  all my adult life the only children i have are the children that i've hired
[3:23:05.220 --> 3:23:10.260]  they're my children so she's scared uh what do you make of
[3:23:10.260 --> 3:23:14.660]  this it's just sensational mike cernovich at cernovich on twitter
[3:23:14.660 --> 3:23:20.340]  yeah i mean she's a beautiful woman now i think she finally she is a christian
[3:23:20.340 --> 3:23:24.180]  a lot of people don't talk about that she's a christian woman i think she
[3:23:24.180 --> 3:23:27.780]  finally maybe god spoke to her she prayed or
[3:23:27.780 --> 3:23:32.500]  found something in her heart but when i heard that video i actually felt sad
[3:23:32.500 --> 3:23:35.860]  you could feel her emotion there's something very
[3:23:35.860 --> 3:23:41.940]  people's not with her spirituals absolutely and what do you make of all
[3:23:41.940 --> 3:23:45.220]  these other big truths coming out right now i mean they have got to be in panic
[3:23:45.220 --> 3:23:49.060]  mode yeah i actually bought her book and had
[3:23:49.060 --> 3:23:53.140]  at the minute it came down and i read it she admits that hillary
[3:23:53.140 --> 3:23:56.900]  clinton did not have pneumonia and that was a lie
[3:23:56.900 --> 3:24:01.540]  she admits that she herself had been concerned with hillary about her health
[3:24:01.540 --> 3:24:06.980]  she admits that other people including doctors had reached out to her
[3:24:06.980 --> 3:24:10.820]  and others to talk about hillary's health and this is all in the book
[3:24:10.820 --> 3:24:15.380]  acts an amazing book so my question is where are apologies
[3:24:15.380 --> 3:24:20.980]  alan all joseph fox was ridiculed were ridiculed i was ridiculed
[3:24:20.980 --> 3:24:25.220]  and donna brazil is now confirmed all of our reporting should the media
[3:24:25.220 --> 3:24:29.460]  apologize to us in very public fashion
[3:24:29.460 --> 3:24:32.980]  where do you see this leading mike
[3:24:35.780 --> 3:24:41.380]  where do you see this leading mike this is leading to other people
[3:24:41.380 --> 3:24:45.060]  are going to come forward now the floodgates are open the stories are
[3:24:45.060 --> 3:24:48.100]  going to come out the truth is definitely going to come out that's
[3:24:48.100 --> 3:24:50.980]  where we're headed you i mean you can feel it everywhere
[3:24:50.980 --> 3:24:58.340]  winestein right louis ck kevin spacey it's all part of a new zeitgeist
[3:24:58.340 --> 3:25:02.420]  where people are tired of the evil and they're tired of covering up for the
[3:25:02.420 --> 3:25:06.740]  demonic forces and they're all going to come forward now and even more evil
[3:25:06.740 --> 3:25:10.740]  will be exposed let's talk about roi more i mean
[3:25:10.740 --> 3:25:13.860]  there's a lot of pedophiles in both parties a lot of perverts so i mean it
[3:25:13.860 --> 3:25:17.380]  could be true but i look at at least one of the main ladies is a democratic
[3:25:17.380 --> 3:25:20.660]  operative works for the dnc works for the candidate
[3:25:20.660 --> 3:25:24.580]  he's running against uh in the senate for the senate
[3:25:24.580 --> 3:25:27.460]  and then you've got the timing all the fakes that they put out on trump
[3:25:27.460 --> 3:25:31.300]  the fact this wasn't brought out earlier the fact that it's 35 years old
[3:25:31.300 --> 3:25:34.740]  uh i mean i again if it's true i say burn him at the stake but
[3:25:34.740 --> 3:25:38.820]  i just at a gut level this just looks political
[3:25:38.820 --> 3:25:43.220]  yeah here's the thing that i found highly suspicious ops
[3:25:43.220 --> 3:25:47.940]  roi more dated multiple women with their parents permission
[3:25:47.940 --> 3:25:51.780]  he essentially courted them in a way now i don't think that a 30 year old man should
[3:25:51.780 --> 3:25:56.340]  date a 17 year old so i'm not here to you to get you know to get about that
[3:25:56.340 --> 3:26:00.820]  but it's unusual though that he would date women with the parents permission
[3:26:00.820 --> 3:26:04.420]  nothing happened he didn't throw themselves on he didn't throw himself on
[3:26:04.420 --> 3:26:07.780]  them like kevin spacey did to a 14 year old boy
[3:26:07.780 --> 3:26:11.220]  but then there's that one story where it claims that kev that and
[3:26:11.220 --> 3:26:15.220]  he tried to go after a 14 year old girl it doesn't really make sense that a man
[3:26:15.220 --> 3:26:18.900]  who had been very uh respectful of the parents and had never done anything
[3:26:18.900 --> 3:26:23.300]  behind anybody's back as i learn more i hear you as i learn
[3:26:23.300 --> 3:26:27.540]  more though i i don't because now it's i mean i think
[3:26:27.540 --> 3:26:32.500]  a 35 year old going after 17 year olds i think it's creepy
[3:26:32.500 --> 3:26:37.620]  oh i'm not defending that yeah that's the thing i i definitely if you're a
[3:26:37.620 --> 3:26:41.460]  32 year old man 34 year old man you don't need to be with 18 year olds that's
[3:26:41.460 --> 3:26:44.340]  what ultimately though pornography does which is what i find
[3:26:44.340 --> 3:26:48.580]  interesting about the outrage from the left they're saying oh you know roi more
[3:26:48.580 --> 3:26:51.940]  was dating an 18 year old and i thought well yes all that
[3:26:51.940 --> 3:26:55.540]  pornography promoted by hollywood promoted by the media
[3:26:55.540 --> 3:26:59.940]  that involves 18 year old girls on their sure that's the big popular stuff they
[3:26:59.940 --> 3:27:02.740]  push you know i think exactly i've not even
[3:27:02.740 --> 3:27:05.860]  been looking for porn before and they're pushing you know barely legal it's in
[3:27:05.860 --> 3:27:10.500]  hotel rooms you see it you know uh in the adult sections it's all
[3:27:10.500 --> 3:27:13.620]  there all i'm saying is when i first saw the news
[3:27:13.620 --> 3:27:17.300]  yesterday there wasn't all this extra stuff i think the first news didn't want
[3:27:17.300 --> 3:27:20.420]  to say it all so they get sued he's saying it's all fake
[3:27:20.420 --> 3:27:25.060]  but if it turns out he's 35 courting 17 year olds
[3:27:25.060 --> 3:27:29.860]  i just think it's weird and i'm just saying
[3:27:29.860 --> 3:27:33.300]  oh no and i agree with you totally that's why i brought it up a lot of people
[3:27:33.300 --> 3:27:36.740]  are claiming that i'm defending the allegations no no i'm
[3:27:36.740 --> 3:27:39.940]  saying that you shouldn't be dating eight
[3:27:39.940 --> 3:27:43.620]  17 year olds if you're in your 30s i'm saying that
[3:27:43.620 --> 3:27:47.540]  what is interesting though though is he went to them the parents for permission
[3:27:47.540 --> 3:27:50.660]  though right and he didn't do anything
[3:27:50.660 --> 3:27:55.140]  sexual with them he didn't throw themselves he didn't abuse them
[3:27:55.140 --> 3:27:58.260]  and then all of a sudden there's a 14 year old said oh he came out in his
[3:27:58.260 --> 3:28:02.420]  tidy widies and you know was really aggressive and everything and that
[3:28:02.420 --> 3:28:05.780]  that to me just doesn't sound consistent with
[3:28:05.780 --> 3:28:09.140]  what he had been doing before that right so that's for me
[3:28:09.140 --> 3:28:12.580]  just trying to figure out the truth of it all because if he did make
[3:28:12.580 --> 3:28:16.420]  a sexual pass at a 14 year old i told people i'll be right part of that
[3:28:16.420 --> 3:28:20.020]  lynch mop i'll i'll bring the rope i got no problem exactly but well you got
[3:28:20.020 --> 3:28:23.060]  there's something like this a very very serious accusation
[3:28:23.060 --> 3:28:25.860]  exactly i'm not just gonna join we saw all the stuff about trump that wasn't
[3:28:25.860 --> 3:28:29.060]  true is my point so that's why out of hand i question it
[3:28:29.060 --> 3:28:32.420]  uh and then you got the same media at first defending winestein well listen
[3:28:32.420 --> 3:28:35.540]  you're gonna take over when you come back your mic's almost back we're gonna
[3:28:35.540 --> 3:28:37.860]  mess with it some more it's definitely not the really good quality we usually

[3:33:24.580 --> 3:33:26.580]  oh
[3:33:29.940 --> 3:33:35.540]  hollywood hollywood babelon all right mike sternovich here i'm co-hosting with him
[3:33:35.540 --> 3:33:38.980]  always great to have him on one of the most prolific journalists out there
[3:33:38.980 --> 3:33:45.300]  one of the tireless ones most tireless i think trump via huckabee's daughter the
[3:33:45.300 --> 3:33:49.700]  press secretary uh huckabee sanders has put out really a perfect statement i
[3:33:49.700 --> 3:33:54.180]  think this is my statement as well if you have a lot of fake allegations over
[3:33:54.180 --> 3:33:59.220]  time you know so we got to wait to see what happens but if it's true step down
[3:33:59.220 --> 3:34:04.660]  and uh we've got the quote right here like most americans the president believes
[3:34:04.660 --> 3:34:07.620]  that we cannot allow a mere allegation in this case
[3:34:07.620 --> 3:34:10.900]  one for many years ago to destroy a person's life
[3:34:10.900 --> 3:34:15.220]  sanders said however the president also believes that if these allegations are
[3:34:15.220 --> 3:34:18.900]  true judge more will do the right thing and step
[3:34:18.900 --> 3:34:25.620]  aside i mean this is just this is just because listen
[3:34:25.700 --> 3:34:28.820]  i this hit me when i was on air yesterday and i just saw the first
[3:34:28.820 --> 3:34:33.060]  article that came out saying no sexual contact and and told a girl that she was
[3:34:33.060 --> 3:34:37.220]  pretty in front of her mom and i thought well that's ridiculous i mean i hadn't
[3:34:37.220 --> 3:34:42.980]  read all the rest of it and the south in some areas is like
[3:34:42.980 --> 3:34:47.460]  it was 200 years ago where older men would want a younger wife that was 15
[3:34:47.460 --> 3:34:50.420]  years younger so they would be able to take care of them when they're old
[3:34:50.420 --> 3:34:54.100]  i mean this is really i want to say backward stuff but
[3:34:54.100 --> 3:34:57.220]  that's i mean there's a lot of families from alabama that founded texas
[3:34:57.220 --> 3:35:00.740]  they came out of alabama in tennessee but back in those days
[3:35:00.740 --> 3:35:04.340]  a lot of times especially if one wife had died on you that was the same age
[3:35:04.340 --> 3:35:07.220]  usually you got about two wives if you lived a long time a couple of your
[3:35:07.220 --> 3:35:11.460]  wives would die and it was vice versa that was like george washington married
[3:35:11.460 --> 3:35:16.020]  married martha and her husband had died a lot of people died young
[3:35:16.020 --> 3:35:20.180]  and it is it is from history and that's the only shot he's got
[3:35:20.180 --> 3:35:23.380]  of it not being creepy it's not illegal i think it's creepy i think you have
[3:35:23.380 --> 3:35:27.780]  been was creepy well 85 going after 18 year olds that's
[3:35:27.780 --> 3:35:32.820]  really creepy but going to parents and then
[3:35:32.820 --> 3:35:37.460]  courting their 17 18 year old daughters to see if they're going to be a good
[3:35:37.460 --> 3:35:40.100]  wife we should look did he end up marrying one of these girls
[3:35:40.100 --> 3:35:43.060]  i guess he's still what i guess his wife does look a lot younger than him
[3:35:43.060 --> 3:35:47.780]  that was the old tactic you would actually get a
[3:35:47.780 --> 3:35:51.140]  10 15 year old younger wife to quote take care of that they didn't have nursing
[3:35:51.140 --> 3:35:55.140]  homes back then your wife took care of you uh that might be what this is but
[3:35:55.140 --> 3:35:58.180]  other than that 14 year olds coming to visit
[3:35:58.180 --> 3:36:01.780]  his house i don't like it and again i'm somebody when i have limited
[3:36:01.780 --> 3:36:04.260]  info i have one of you when i get more i have i have more
[3:36:04.260 --> 3:36:08.980]  mike sardvich what do you think yeah and that's why i brought it up by the way
[3:36:08.980 --> 3:36:13.140]  because the truth fears no inquiry right i'm not here saying
[3:36:13.140 --> 3:36:16.260]  playing a defense lawyer for roya more i'm the one who was said actually
[3:36:16.260 --> 3:36:21.060]  i read the article and he had been courting um 18 year old a 17 year old
[3:36:21.060 --> 3:36:24.820]  apparently he may have asked a 16 year old out on a date which
[3:36:24.820 --> 3:36:29.220]  i'm not going to defend that behavior no but but but what i know if i catch a
[3:36:29.220 --> 3:36:32.260]  35 year old man trying to pick up my 14 year old daughter they're going to get
[3:36:32.260 --> 3:36:36.180]  their damn jaw broken it but what what i found
[3:36:36.180 --> 3:36:39.620]  interesting is that roya more would go to the mothers
[3:36:39.620 --> 3:36:44.100]  okay in all those instances that the specific allegation involving the 14
[3:36:44.100 --> 3:36:47.780]  year old it claims that he went behind the mom's back
[3:36:47.780 --> 3:36:51.140]  picked up the 14 year old drove her out to a house
[3:36:51.140 --> 3:36:54.580]  put her down on the floor gave her wine and came out in tidy whiteies
[3:36:54.580 --> 3:36:59.220]  that's pedophile behavior right there and as we know pedophiles never stop
[3:36:59.220 --> 3:37:04.100]  but we hadn't heard exactly that's why i questioned it is there's never history
[3:37:04.100 --> 3:37:08.740]  but then you know what so it may all be it may all be a complete lie
[3:37:08.740 --> 3:37:12.820]  that's what i'm saying just like trump said if if you know we got to check in
[3:37:12.820 --> 3:37:17.540]  this make sure it's true we've seen a lot of lies but if it is true
[3:37:18.340 --> 3:37:21.860]  yeah exactly pedophiles they never quit
[3:37:21.860 --> 3:37:26.180]  and we we have this isn't like kevin spacey we heard about kevin spacey
[3:37:26.180 --> 3:37:30.740]  and charlie sheen and louis we've heard stuff like that for years and in some
[3:37:30.740 --> 3:37:34.500]  cases that clear as libertarians as conservatives when we see that this could
[3:37:34.500 --> 3:37:38.420]  be possible we're jumping all over it instead of just ignoring it
[3:37:38.420 --> 3:37:44.420]  like the democrats do exactly well and i also mentioned why is the media not
[3:37:44.420 --> 3:37:48.980]  looking into bob anindas they actually covered that up he's accused by federal
[3:37:48.980 --> 3:37:53.140]  prosecutors this isn't it the men in this accusation doesn't involve
[3:37:53.140 --> 3:37:57.060]  an accusation the washington post which has spread a lot of fake news
[3:37:57.060 --> 3:38:01.460]  federal prosecutors had actually said an article that that i mean i sent this of
[3:38:01.460 --> 3:38:05.220]  course the production team about bob anindas so
[3:38:05.220 --> 3:38:09.380]  why are the media not asking democrats hey if this stuff about underage
[3:38:09.380 --> 3:38:13.940]  people is true will you disavow him the the media is completely silent about
[3:38:13.940 --> 3:38:17.460]  bob anindas they covered up bill clinton's multiple rape
[3:38:17.460 --> 3:38:21.620]  accusations but now when it's roi more they're like look at us we're steadfast
[3:38:21.620 --> 3:38:23.940]  defenders and we're really going to do aggressive
[3:38:23.940 --> 3:38:27.220]  journalism like wait a minute they ignored we need a broader act
[3:38:27.220 --> 3:38:30.180]  right they covered up for bill clinton the rapist for years
[3:38:30.180 --> 3:38:34.740]  they're not talking about bob anindas and that's the problem here that you and
[3:38:34.740 --> 3:38:38.260]  i and other people have is if this is true
[3:38:38.260 --> 3:38:41.620]  hey i hope somebody you know legally of course i'm not going to make threats on
[3:38:41.620 --> 3:38:45.700]  air but if it's true that roi more tried to take advantage of a 14 year old
[3:38:45.700 --> 3:38:48.900]  man i don't care what happens that guy the issue is that
[3:38:48.900 --> 3:38:52.500]  where was the media believing the victims of bill clinton
[3:38:52.500 --> 3:38:55.860]  where is the media talking about bob anindas where is the media actually
[3:38:55.860 --> 3:38:59.140]  being a hero we got bill clinton's settling rape cases
[3:38:59.140 --> 3:39:04.420]  paying money i mean we've got bona fide
[3:39:04.420 --> 3:39:08.100]  exactly and the media pretends it doesn't happen bill clinton's a hero bill
[3:39:08.100 --> 3:39:10.900]  clinton's a great man they never talked about how
[3:39:10.900 --> 3:39:14.180]  hillary clinton enabled the rape they never talked about how she liked to
[3:39:14.180 --> 3:39:18.900]  represent child molesters right um hillary clinton represented a child
[3:39:18.900 --> 3:39:22.580]  rapist laughed because she was able to traumatize
[3:39:22.580 --> 3:39:25.620]  a young girl who was never able to actually have children because the
[3:39:25.620 --> 3:39:28.900]  the rape was so violent the media never asked
[3:39:28.900 --> 3:39:32.900]  trawl schumer hey uh anthony weiner let i mean let's just talk about the truth
[3:39:32.900 --> 3:39:35.700]  dollop let's talk about the truth for a minute because
[3:39:35.700 --> 3:39:39.620]  this is opening up a lot of um questions one is that
[3:39:39.620 --> 3:39:43.940]  trawl schumer groomed which maybe is an unfortunate word considering what anthony
[3:39:43.940 --> 3:39:46.980]  weiner was doing but trawl schumer groomed anthony weiner to be a
[3:39:46.980 --> 3:39:50.580]  successor anthony weiner was in congress but i don't
[3:39:50.580 --> 3:39:55.220]  hear the media saying hey democrats do you comment about anthony weiner he's
[3:39:55.220 --> 3:39:58.020]  going to prison yeah yeah yeah where is chuck schumer
[3:39:58.020 --> 3:40:00.820]  disavowing i got all these text messages and calls
[3:40:00.820 --> 3:40:05.860]  for media do you disavow roi more well it's easy to disavow david duke because
[3:40:05.860 --> 3:40:10.260]  we know what he stands for with roi more we don't know if he's guilty
[3:40:10.260 --> 3:40:15.380]  right and why wasn't the media asking people do you disavow bob menendez do
[3:40:15.380 --> 3:40:20.020]  you disavow anthony weiner they go oh you know they even they call us me they go
[3:40:20.020 --> 3:40:24.500]  how dare you try to exploit this tragedy for your own political ends they go
[3:40:24.500 --> 3:40:28.100]  how dare you politicize these sex crimes and i go wait a minute
[3:40:28.100 --> 3:40:31.620]  that's what they're doing right now and that's why they can't
[3:40:31.620 --> 3:40:35.060]  cry now because we don't necessarily believe them we don't take
[3:40:35.060 --> 3:40:40.020]  the washington post alex they still call me all right over a year ago i said look
[3:40:40.020 --> 3:40:42.980]  i didn't know these people were lunatics you know i thought they were just
[3:40:42.980 --> 3:40:46.260]  people trying to you know have some uncomfortable conversations i know they
[3:40:46.260 --> 3:40:50.260]  want to throw nazi salutes and carry hitler flags so over a year ago i said
[3:40:50.260 --> 3:40:52.980]  i'm not all right i want nothing to do with those guys
[3:40:52.980 --> 3:40:57.060]  the washington post through this day calls me all right which is a lie
[3:40:57.060 --> 3:41:00.740]  my wife paul washington over a year ago said the same thing we're new right
[3:41:00.740 --> 3:41:06.180]  we're not all right and we even identify and they won't let us identify as we
[3:41:06.180 --> 3:41:08.820]  want to identify that you they claim it's so important let someone identify as
[3:41:08.820 --> 3:41:11.700]  they identify but with us they won't let us do it
[3:41:11.700 --> 3:41:14.660]  exactly and then they go well sort of it how dare you not believe the washington
[3:41:14.660 --> 3:41:18.100]  post yeah how dare i not believe a publication
[3:41:18.100 --> 3:41:22.100]  that lies about me and in a very easy way and in a way where they're trying to
[3:41:22.100 --> 3:41:25.700]  get me murdered actually if you call somebody a white nationalist while
[3:41:25.700 --> 3:41:29.300]  you're telling people go punch a nazi then what you're doing if you're in

[3:46:27.460 --> 3:46:30.100]  there you have the organic clove bud the organic
[3:46:30.100 --> 3:46:34.420]  wormwood i recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year all right

[3:46:53.540 --> 3:47:14.260]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:14.260 --> 3:47:22.180]  so back in 2005
[3:47:22.180 --> 3:47:27.460]  the family guy had an episode where the baby
[3:47:27.460 --> 3:47:32.740]  that could talk escapes from kevin spacey's sex dungeon for children
[3:47:32.740 --> 3:47:36.740]  and again over and over again they say he does this just like the wine sting
[3:47:36.740 --> 3:47:40.900]  jokes it shows they knew and then made jokes about it we're going to go back
[3:47:40.900 --> 3:47:45.460]  to mike cernovich here in just a moment we're still messing with his microphone
[3:47:45.460 --> 3:47:48.500]  and hey it happens he's remote we appreciate him joining us
[3:47:48.500 --> 3:47:51.860]  but we're going to loot this a few times for you to point out
[3:47:51.860 --> 3:47:55.940]  where were the accusations of judge roi moore
[3:47:55.940 --> 3:47:58.820]  where were the accusations of trump before he ran for office
[3:47:58.820 --> 3:48:02.340]  that's why it's all suspect could it be true absolutely
[3:48:02.340 --> 3:48:06.580]  but the timing is everything where do these i mean i've been a public figure
[3:48:06.580 --> 3:48:12.260]  for 20 something years been very well known for five six
[3:48:12.260 --> 3:48:14.980]  where the accusations they could make them up about me folks
[3:48:14.980 --> 3:48:20.100]  this is a political war is more guilty it hasn't been confirmed he courted 17
[3:48:20.100 --> 3:48:22.500]  year olds i think that's just a little weird if it's true
[3:48:22.500 --> 3:48:26.100]  i looked at his wife to see the similarities here it is there really
[3:48:26.100 --> 3:48:32.340]  aren't she was 24 he was 38 14 year age difference
[3:48:32.340 --> 3:48:38.100]  still married and that is i'd forgotten i really thought about it
[3:48:38.100 --> 3:48:42.180]  kind of an old-fashioned thing where men get a wife older than them to take
[3:48:42.180 --> 3:48:46.340]  care of them get a wife that's young and can cook
[3:48:46.340 --> 3:48:50.340]  so she'd take care of when you're old i mean
[3:48:50.340 --> 3:48:54.100]  everybody my family married women the exact same age my dad
[3:48:54.100 --> 3:48:58.980]  mom's same age my grandparents one grandfather was two years older
[3:48:58.980 --> 3:49:02.420]  the other grandfather was a year older that's usually it's about a year too
[3:49:02.420 --> 3:49:05.700]  older is is is kind of usually how it is because that's
[3:49:05.700 --> 3:49:09.860]  who's in your group and you know who's into the same things
[3:49:09.860 --> 3:49:13.940]  but it all varies it's not bad if some 70 year old guy wants to have a 30 year
[3:49:13.940 --> 3:49:16.660]  old wife uh she's just probably doing it because
[3:49:16.660 --> 3:49:19.780]  she wants some money but hey who cares the old guys will tell you how i don't
[3:49:19.780 --> 3:49:23.060]  care if she just wants some money sonny
[3:49:23.060 --> 3:49:26.580]  but it's totally different when they start going after children
[3:49:26.580 --> 3:49:29.780]  and let me tell you have a judge roy more truly did that and asked to date my
[3:49:29.780 --> 3:49:33.860]  14 year old daughter i'm telling you're a creepy person you better get off my
[3:49:33.860 --> 3:49:37.060]  front porch you might get punched in your nose but again there's no
[3:49:37.060 --> 3:49:41.140]  proof yet we'll see though as there is we'll report it uh here is that that
[3:49:41.140 --> 3:50:01.620]  clip from the uh family
[3:50:01.620 --> 3:50:03.460]  of course it turns out according to the family
[3:50:03.460 --> 3:50:06.420]  kevin spacey's father was a devil worshiping nazi
[3:50:06.420 --> 3:50:09.620]  who tortured them in a basement
[3:50:09.620 --> 3:50:15.060]  my son of it's pretty incredible where do you think all this is going
[3:50:15.060 --> 3:50:19.220]  yeah and then i said i think seth mcfarland had also made a joke about
[3:50:19.220 --> 3:50:22.980]  how women now won't have to pretend to be attracted to harvey weinstein so
[3:50:22.980 --> 3:50:28.740]  clearly clearly they all know a lot and more they said in award shows they've
[3:50:28.740 --> 3:50:31.700]  they've they've got all these addresses in tv movies saying
[3:50:31.700 --> 3:50:34.900]  you know i've had harvey weinstein try to have sex with me five times
[3:50:34.900 --> 3:50:40.980]  and refuse twice exactly and i predicted on a podcast
[3:50:40.980 --> 3:50:45.140]  uh before the kevin spacey thing hit i said now with the weinstein stuff the
[3:50:45.140 --> 3:50:49.700]  pedophile stuff is going to become very intense now and then suddenly
[3:50:49.700 --> 3:50:52.500]  you know kevin spacey that allegation came out
[3:50:52.500 --> 3:50:57.380]  the the allegation against charlie sheen um came out as well the daily mail is
[3:50:57.380 --> 3:50:59.940]  reporting on that we're gonna we're gonna hear more of it
[3:50:59.940 --> 3:51:03.380]  we're not even at 10 percent it's the tip of the iceberg
[3:51:03.380 --> 3:51:06.980]  and people are now realizing what degenerates and not even degenerates
[3:51:06.980 --> 3:51:10.980]  but what sexual predators they are in hollywood why is the number so high
[3:51:10.980 --> 3:51:14.020]  because i mean i gotta tell you i wouldn't say i knew charlie sheen super
[3:51:14.020 --> 3:51:17.460]  super like like like best buddies or close friends but i probably say in his
[3:51:17.460 --> 3:51:21.060]  house 13 14 times and i can remember a lot of times i'd use it as a hotel in a
[3:51:21.060 --> 3:51:24.900]  big nice house i'd be out there working say hey stay here
[3:51:24.900 --> 3:51:29.060]  working reading books he was always getting dedicated whatever wife he had
[3:51:29.060 --> 3:51:32.180]  smoking a lot of cigarettes drinking a lot of coffee then he started using drugs
[3:51:32.180 --> 3:51:34.980]  and stuff and it wasn't cool i know i'm only been over there like
[3:51:34.980 --> 3:51:38.980]  twice the last six years or so you know try to get him off drugs but i i saw
[3:51:38.980 --> 3:51:43.140]  some wild women there but they were all like 30 35
[3:51:43.140 --> 3:51:47.620]  uh you know and he and people told me yeah i know his taste is like you know
[3:51:47.620 --> 3:51:52.100]  you know full grown women uh but i mean who knows i'm also worried about them
[3:51:52.100 --> 3:51:54.660]  spiking some fake stories on somebody like charlie
[3:51:54.660 --> 3:51:57.620]  who's an easy target and i'm not saying it's fake
[3:51:57.620 --> 3:52:01.220]  this will be taken very seriously because he's an easy target then that kind of
[3:52:01.220 --> 3:52:04.100]  diverts off from other people
[3:52:04.100 --> 3:52:07.780]  oh well there's all kinds of things going on right now i'm surprised that i
[3:52:07.780 --> 3:52:11.940]  haven't heard anything about you or me or paul joseph watson or something
[3:52:11.940 --> 3:52:16.500]  i'm completely fabricated too because they do want to deflect and that's why
[3:52:16.500 --> 3:52:20.020]  you know this broy more stuff comes out it was all democrats
[3:52:20.020 --> 3:52:24.020]  being called out all hollywood people and then now there's broy more
[3:52:24.020 --> 3:52:29.060]  so every day that i wake up i expect to see a false completely fabricated story
[3:52:29.060 --> 3:52:32.180]  about me or uh friends of ours because
[3:52:32.180 --> 3:52:36.180]  that's what they have to do now to try to say look everybody is it
[3:52:36.180 --> 3:52:40.820]  it isn't just the democrat hollywood elite it isn't just the bobbin indians
[3:52:40.820 --> 3:52:44.180]  isn't the anthony weiner isn't that the bill clinton sure i said this two months
[3:52:44.180 --> 3:52:46.980]  ago the only way for them to have credibility after they covered up the
[3:52:46.980 --> 3:52:51.140]  clinton's everything is to burn a bunch of their own then get that rolling and
[3:52:51.140 --> 3:52:56.100]  then have some cred to go after the conservatives christians and libertarians
[3:52:56.100 --> 3:52:59.460]  exactly and that could be their next play
[3:52:59.460 --> 3:53:03.940]  it's very hard to say but with social media and the people waking up
[3:53:03.940 --> 3:53:07.860]  it is going to be very hard for example most of my people not even most 90
[3:53:07.860 --> 3:53:10.420]  percent of people who read me don't believe
[3:53:10.420 --> 3:53:14.500]  any allegation because it's in the wash and post now if you or i broke this
[3:53:14.500 --> 3:53:18.580]  story or breitbart or drudge broke the story our people would believe it
[3:53:18.580 --> 3:53:23.700]  but wapo has lied so many times now that it isn't going to affect us so even if
[3:53:23.700 --> 3:53:26.980]  they did fabricate things about us our listeners aren't even going to
[3:53:26.980 --> 3:53:29.860]  believe it because they're going to say you know these people that if you'll
[3:53:29.860 --> 3:53:33.540]  lie and call these people all right if you lie and call them nazis
[3:53:33.540 --> 3:53:36.580]  then why wouldn't you lie and fabricate all kinds of sexual
[3:53:36.580 --> 3:53:40.500]  all at your point i think it was with newsweek where they were pointing at
[3:53:40.500 --> 3:53:42.900]  you're like why are you calling democrats pedophiles well they keep
[3:53:42.900 --> 3:53:45.780]  getting busted it was like why are we obsessed with pedophiles well no they
[3:53:45.780 --> 3:53:48.580]  are and then and then you go hey you keep calling us nazis
[3:53:48.580 --> 3:53:51.700]  with absolutely no proof so so how does that feel
[3:53:51.700 --> 3:53:57.140]  but but expanding on this we now have project veritas with them saying shut
[3:53:57.140 --> 3:54:00.660]  down info works number one job uh with with youtube with google
[3:54:00.660 --> 3:54:04.660]  now we have them in hearings with the director of twitter saying
[3:54:04.660 --> 3:54:09.060]  we shut down alex jones and paul watson at lunch lawyers telling me this is
[3:54:09.060 --> 3:54:15.540]  powerful civil rights violation why are they so open about it what's going on
[3:54:15.540 --> 3:54:20.340]  well remember when during the dnc leaks paul and you and i we were saying that
[3:54:20.340 --> 3:54:24.020]  twitter was censoring the hashtag and twitter goes absolutely not we didn't
[3:54:24.020 --> 3:54:26.820]  do that and then in testimony they go well
[3:54:26.820 --> 3:54:31.700]  actually we deleted 48 percent of the tweets and censored the hashtags right
[3:54:31.700 --> 3:54:34.660]  so everything that we've said they've been doing
[3:54:34.660 --> 3:54:38.100]  they are in fact doing because they want to silence the people
[3:54:38.100 --> 3:54:41.060]  and that is really why the support of the people and the listeners and the
[3:54:41.060 --> 3:54:45.220]  readers now matters more than ever because this is not an attack
[3:54:45.220 --> 3:54:49.620]  on you and me we're just puppets to the globalist pedophile masterminds
[3:54:49.620 --> 3:54:52.580]  you and i were they're attacking us because republic figures
[3:54:52.580 --> 3:54:56.420]  ultimately this is an attack on every every nuclear family
[3:54:56.420 --> 3:55:00.180]  in america they're trying to destroy the nuclear family they're trying to enslave
[3:55:00.180 --> 3:55:03.860]  people that's it we're figureheads of the of the nuclear family
[3:55:03.860 --> 3:55:07.940]  and of just basic sanity and and if they could shut us down they could shut
[3:55:07.940 --> 3:55:10.900]  everybody down and they now exactly they lied about it said they weren't
[3:55:10.900 --> 3:55:14.420]  now they have to admit it because they know they've been caught so the decision
[3:55:14.420 --> 3:55:20.340]  is hide it and blame you exactly so what you and i if we went away
[3:55:20.340 --> 3:55:23.460]  and somebody replaced us then the media would never even talk about us they
[3:55:23.460 --> 3:55:27.460]  would talk about whoever the new person on the vanguard was the new public
[3:55:27.460 --> 3:55:32.900]  figure fundamentally anybody who preaches a pro america
[3:55:32.900 --> 3:55:36.580]  pro family pro morals because i respect all religions
[3:55:36.580 --> 3:55:41.780]  anybody trying to live a moral life jewish whether that's jewish or
[3:55:41.780 --> 3:55:45.860]  muslim or christian who's really trying to be moral and live a better life i
[3:55:45.860 --> 3:55:49.700]  respect all all of that but they want to destroy
[3:55:49.700 --> 3:55:54.340]  everybody who has any kind of religion that way i mean i mean think about it
[3:55:54.340 --> 3:55:57.860]  this is what's coming out and the women who are making accusations are powerful
[3:55:57.860 --> 3:56:02.180]  people imagine the household people who can't speak english
[3:56:02.180 --> 3:56:05.300]  that are being raped so let's talk about this for a minute because this was
[3:56:05.300 --> 3:56:08.180]  called a conspiracy theory by the media before
[3:56:08.180 --> 3:56:11.540]  you and i had said that they want that they being the globalists and the
[3:56:11.540 --> 3:56:15.700]  democrat hollywood media pedophile establishment they want open borders
[3:56:15.700 --> 3:56:18.580]  so then they can bring in vulnerable women and children
[3:56:18.580 --> 3:56:22.500]  to rape and people go that's crazy and now it's all out that they're using the
[3:56:22.500 --> 3:56:27.060]  human trafficking to do that right but if they will
[3:56:27.060 --> 3:56:31.060]  attack and sexually assault very affluent
[3:56:31.060 --> 3:56:35.380]  high-profile women imagine what they're doing
[3:56:35.380 --> 3:56:40.180]  to their domestic household staff i'll be surprised if we don't hear more
[3:56:40.180 --> 3:56:44.100]  and we gotta just we gotta just say look if you come forward against hollywood
[3:56:44.100 --> 3:56:47.380]  we have to give them citizenship we have to just say look if you're gonna be a
[3:56:47.380 --> 3:56:50.900]  whistleblower about your your hollywood pedophile master
[3:56:50.900 --> 3:56:53.460]  then we're you know we're not going to deport you we're gonna take care of
[3:56:53.460 --> 3:56:56.660]  you treat you like the america sure what about this new york group that it turns
[3:56:56.660 --> 3:56:59.220]  out they tell them as a feminist group and they
[3:56:59.220 --> 3:57:03.620]  brand the women reportedly and call the man master and it's all a big liberal
[3:57:03.620 --> 3:57:05.940]  group i mean we already know about though there's other group people haven't
[3:57:05.940 --> 3:57:10.500]  heard about but that's what this is yes a sex cult
