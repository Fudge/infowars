[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the Information War continues.
[00:07.000 --> 00:11.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:11.000 --> 00:30.000]  It is Sunday, February 7th, 2010, Super Bowl Sunday.
[00:30.000 --> 00:35.000]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[00:35.000 --> 00:38.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:38.000 --> 00:45.000]  Stuart Rhodes of Oathkeepers will be with us in the last 30 minutes of the day in studio.
[00:45.000 --> 00:53.000]  I want to talk about getting our priorities straight as a nation
[00:53.000 --> 01:00.000]  and how we're distracted and diverted from fixing our country and securing our destiny and our freedoms
[01:00.000 --> 01:10.000]  by things like American Idol and the Super Bowl and other corporate frauds.
[01:10.000 --> 01:13.000]  But I also want to get into Sarah Palin.
[01:13.000 --> 01:23.000]  I watched much of her one-hour speech to the big Tea Party conference in Tennessee over the weekend
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  and it is George Bush reincarnated, George W. Bush.
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.000]  The Tea Parties have been fully hijacked and people are being set up.
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.000]  Just like I told the Obama supporters, you were being set up.
[01:37.000 --> 01:40.000]  Henry Kissinger advises Obama.
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  He advises Sarah Palin.
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.000]  The same crew runs these people.
[01:45.000 --> 01:52.000]  John McCain picked her and she may hold an AR-15 on TV
[01:52.000 --> 01:58.000]  and she's against the big government takeover of health care and a few things like that, so that's positive.
[01:58.000 --> 02:05.000]  But overall, she's for the Patriot Act, for the police state, for the wars
[02:05.000 --> 02:13.000]  and she's from the same Republican elite that want to give you open borders and amnesty and all the rest of it.
[02:13.000 --> 02:18.000]  Sarah Palin is not going to save you, America.
[02:18.000 --> 02:24.000]  And of course, years from now, if she gets elected president, people will go back and say, oh my God, you were right.
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.000]  We don't have time for this.
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.000]  Okay?
[02:29.000 --> 02:38.000]  The only bona fide constitutionalist who could make a good president and who isn't a distraction is Ron Paul.
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.000]  He's the only one.
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  The presidency itself outside of Ron Paul is a distraction.
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.000]  The real fight is at the state level to get our sovereignty back.
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  Anything else is a distraction and a diversion, so that's coming up.
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  Now, I didn't mean for this to be the top story today.
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.000]  It is the top story.
[03:03.000 --> 03:10.000]  Billions of people on the globe can now not visit infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[03:10.000 --> 03:25.000]  There is a concerted, organized operation going on to shut down access to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com in Italy.
[03:25.000 --> 03:33.000]  In Australia, in New Zealand, and in China, and in England that we know of in the last two weeks.
[03:33.000 --> 03:35.000]  We have confirmed it.
[03:35.000 --> 03:42.000]  We've got a big report coming out tomorrow at prisonplanet.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.000]  And so that is our top story today.
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.000]  When we come back from the break, House passes cyber security bill.
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  That's the New York Times. Kurt Nemo's headline at infowars.com.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  House overwhelmingly passes cyber security bill.
[03:59.000 --> 04:05.000]  And the Senate version is even worse. Kurt Nemo's working on a story for that tomorrow.
[04:05.000 --> 04:11.000]  But we have gotten so used to the fact that we are being censored in many different ways.
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.000]  And it's not just us.
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.000]  It's going to be everybody.
[04:18.000 --> 04:28.000]  And we know what happened in New Zealand earlier this week and in parts of Australia where they suddenly started shutting down access to websites in mass.
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  Mainstream news of Australia reporting this.
[04:33.000 --> 04:41.000]  If you're in New Zealand and are with one of the big providers, you can't get us.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  Some of the small ones you still can't.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  If you're in China, you can't get us.
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  In Australia, you can't get us. If you're in Italy, you can't get us on most systems.
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  And it's admitted that we are banned.
[04:51.000 --> 04:56.000]  infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.000]  We'll be right back.
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[05:04.000 --> 05:07.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[05:07.000 --> 05:12.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.000]  They've turned tremendous influence on our president in Congress.
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.000]  And they really are calling the shots.
[05:18.000 --> 05:23.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[05:23.000 --> 05:27.000]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[05:27.000 --> 05:34.000]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[05:34.000 --> 05:36.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  They're asking for more matches.
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[05:42.000 --> 05:47.000]  And right now in Washington, DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[05:47.000 --> 05:52.000]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[05:52.000 --> 06:11.000]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[06:23.000 --> 06:30.000]  I remember reading the executive order back in 1993 that Bill Clinton signed,
[06:30.000 --> 06:40.000]  stating that all the 50 states' driver's license systems were being federally standardized for a real ID.
[06:40.000 --> 06:49.000]  And I went on the radio in the mid-90s and I warned people about the fact that the states were being federalized.
[06:49.000 --> 06:52.000]  A lot of people laughed even though I had the executive order.
[06:52.000 --> 06:55.000]  They didn't know how to look it up or they didn't want to.
[06:55.000 --> 06:59.000]  People were not proficient on the internet at that time.
[06:59.000 --> 07:07.000]  And of course in 2002, 2003, 2004, they rolled out the real ID and said, look,
[07:07.000 --> 07:10.000]  your driver's license is really a federal ID card.
[07:10.000 --> 07:16.000]  And of course by then they already signed treaties in 2000 making it a world ID card.
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  I remember telling you in 1996, because we had the declassified documents,
[07:21.000 --> 07:27.000]  that all babies in the Western world under a UN program had their blood taken at birth
[07:27.000 --> 07:34.000]  and put in a DNA database for genetic engineering testing, law enforcement purposes.
[07:34.000 --> 07:40.000]  Now it was on CNN yesterday, but spinning and saying, oh, it's in case your kid gets lost.
[07:40.000 --> 07:44.000]  And yeah, it is for genetic testing and genetic engineering.
[07:44.000 --> 07:49.000]  CBS News reports, oh, guess what, they've patented all your blood specifically
[07:49.000 --> 07:53.000]  and federal courts are ruling you don't even own your own samples
[07:53.000 --> 07:57.000]  and the big genetic companies have gone and patented your genetic treatments
[07:57.000 --> 08:01.000]  so that if you ever get genetic treatments in the future, you'll have to pay them.
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.000]  That's CBS News.
[08:03.000 --> 08:06.000]  Court rules you don't own your own DNA.
[08:06.000 --> 08:10.000]  The reason I opened the show up with that on Super Bowl Sunday,
[08:10.000 --> 08:20.000]  the seventh day of February 2010, is because you can see what the government's doing
[08:20.000 --> 08:25.000]  many years before they admit to what they're doing.
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  You can see it in white papers.
[08:27.000 --> 08:31.000]  You can read it in different symposium meetings they've had.
[08:31.000 --> 08:36.000]  You can read what the Rand Corporation and the Army War College
[08:36.000 --> 08:39.000]  and the Council on Foreign Relations are saying they're going to do
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.000]  because they actually write up the policy that's then adopted by government.
[08:44.000 --> 08:49.000]  There has been a decision made about six years ago
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.000]  to incrementally shut down the Internet as we know it
[08:54.000 --> 08:58.000]  and to force you onto Internet too that's highly restricted
[08:58.000 --> 09:03.000]  where you have to enter the equivalent of a driver's license number to get online
[09:03.000 --> 09:08.000]  where everything you do is tracked, where everything you do is stored.
[09:08.000 --> 09:13.000]  And where the Pentagon goes around hacking and attacking websites
[09:13.000 --> 09:15.000]  that criticize the government domestically
[09:15.000 --> 09:21.000]  and they sensed three years ago announced they're actually doing that.
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.000]  But Americans especially think they're living in a free country in many respects
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  so they're in denial about this.
[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  Brits are in denial.
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.000]  Italians are in denial.
[09:33.000 --> 09:34.000]  French are in denial.
[09:34.000 --> 09:35.000]  Germans are in denial.
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  Aussies are in denial.
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  Kiwis are in denial.
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.000]  People in New Zealand.
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  Well, the denial now needs to end
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.000]  and it needs to end very, very quickly.
[09:52.000 --> 09:58.000]  Because people recognize that the global carbon tax
[09:58.000 --> 10:02.000]  was the establishment of World Government 4 of and by private banks
[10:02.000 --> 10:06.000]  and because we exposed the fraud of it, it's now in deep trouble.
[10:06.000 --> 10:10.000]  Because we exposed that the swine flu shot was dangerous
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  and that it was a hoax
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.000]  and that the swine flu itself was not dangerous compared to the regular flu,
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  record numbers of people didn't take it
[10:18.000 --> 10:22.000]  and it's now all over the mainstream news that it was a hoax and a fraud.
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.000]  If we can admit to ourselves what's happening to Internet freedom
[10:28.000 --> 10:35.000]  and why this is being done, we can save the Internet.
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.000]  What the establishment has done is the NSA and DARPA created the Internet
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  as you know in the late 60s.
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.000]  It is a Pentagon creation.
[10:45.000 --> 10:50.000]  Last year the Pentagon gave control of the private corporate consortium
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.000]  they created ICANN to the UN
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.000]  because the UN was created by the Pentagon in 1945.
[10:57.000 --> 10:59.000]  It's another front.
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  It's now come out as we told you five years ago.
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.000]  We had a high-level CIA officer, Mr. Steele, on to expose it.
[11:05.000 --> 11:07.000]  It's now mainstream news.
[11:07.000 --> 11:11.000]  Google has always been CIA, set up by NQTEL.
[11:11.000 --> 11:15.000]  IBM is a government front, even pre-OSS.
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  Microsoft is a government front.
[11:17.000 --> 11:22.000]  All these major corporations, the Fortune 100, are government fronts.
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  Just like Hughes, Space and Aeronautics, it was later came out
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  was a complete government front.
[11:29.000 --> 11:34.000]  It's all a government front.
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.000]  And then, of course, it makes the insiders that control government fabulously rich.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  They take your tax money, put trillions of dollars in the aggregate
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.000]  into raw research, and then give it to select groups
[11:45.000 --> 11:50.000]  so they control the global architecture.
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  Now, why am I opening the show with this today?
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  Coming up, I'm going to get into the Super Bowl
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  and how it's a distraction and a diversion.
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.000]  I'm going to get into Sarah Palin hijacking the Tea Party movement,
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.000]  just like Obama hijacked the anti-war liberal movement.
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.000]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  I should be running around like a chicken with my head cut off,
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  but I've been censored and restricted in so many ways over the years
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.000]  that I've come to expect it, and that shows I'm being acclimated, and that's wrong.
[12:19.000 --> 12:25.000]  But at least I'm conscious of the fact that I'm being marinated and tyranny until I accept it.
[12:25.000 --> 12:32.000]  The federal government, the UN,
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.000]  I can have all announced that the Internet will be a few thousand megabytes
[12:37.000 --> 12:41.000]  and you will be allowed to have a subdomain like you do on YouTube
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  or you do on MySpace or Facebook,
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000]  and they will ban you and restrict you whenever they want.
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  That is the official statement of the Internet, too, going back over six years.
[12:50.000 --> 12:56.000]  Now Time magazine's calling for it. The head of the UN Internet program's calling for it.
[12:56.000 --> 13:02.000]  Cass Sunstein, White House regulations are, is calling for it.
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.000]  The New York Times is calling for it.
[13:05.000 --> 13:10.000]  They're calling for NoMoreInfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[13:10.000 --> 13:17.000]  Now, we've caught countless big ISPs in England, the U.S., Australia, all over the world,
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  banningInfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.000]  The issue is they claim that they're not censoring and do this.
[13:25.000 --> 13:28.000]  You can say, well, it's their company and they can do what they want.
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  The point is they do it covertly.
[13:30.000 --> 13:33.000]  And people always complain and then they unblock it.
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.000]  MySpace admits they ban our bulletins from going out.
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  We've gotten that directly from MySpace.
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  Google has admitted that they've censored us.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  YouTube has admitted that they've censored us.
[13:42.000 --> 13:48.000]  They've written countless articles with their own admissions there.
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.000]  All over the train systems and free government systems that you pay for as taxpayers in the U.S.,
[13:53.000 --> 14:01.000]  in Canada, in Europe, you're not allowed to visit infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[14:01.000 --> 14:07.000]  This is how they operate. This is what they're doing.
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  That's one thing.
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  I'm going to cover this because I have two guys that work for me, Paul Watson and Steve Watson,
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.000]  and you pay as a taxpayer in England for this, quote, free broadband,
[14:17.000 --> 14:20.000]  and then their laptops and cell phones won't go to InfoWars and PrisonPlanet.
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  It gives them a message that it's blocked.
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.000]  And you go to libraries and you go to schools and public schools and corporations do it.
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  You can argue, well, corporations are allowed to.
[14:30.000 --> 14:38.000]  You can't visit infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.000]  But as of two weeks ago, and we've gotten the error messages,
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.000]  we've gotten the confirmed emails from China, they're coming in by the hundreds a day,
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  we are banned to a billion-plus Chinese.
[14:48.000 --> 14:54.000]  InfoWars and PrisonPlanet now banned.
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  Whole areas of Australia were banned.
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  It's the big ISPs doing it.
[14:59.000 --> 15:06.000]  We're banned to most users in New Zealand, and there's actually articles in the New Zealand news about this.
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.000]  This just happened in the last three days.
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  We're getting massive emails that were banned in Italy on most systems.
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  People still can get around it some ways with proxy servers and other things.
[15:18.000 --> 15:25.000]  So notice right as our own media, the British media, the European media, the Aussie media and others
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  call for the censorship.
[15:27.000 --> 15:32.000]  And again, we have tons of articles I covered throughout the week from major newspapers in Australia
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.000]  where mainline political parties are now banned, where WikiLeaks is banned,
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  where mainline sites are banned.
[15:40.000 --> 15:41.000]  We're not the only ones.
[15:41.000 --> 15:46.000]  They're just banning Chinese-style net censorship.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  And that's what these countries are calling it.
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  They're proudly doing it, are spreading everywhere.
[15:52.000 --> 15:59.000]  So a day is coming very soon where you won't be able to visit InfoWars or PrisonPlanet anywhere.

[19:57.000 --> 20:04.000]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[20:04.000 --> 20:08.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Super Bowl Sunday.
[20:08.000 --> 20:10.000]  I've got some things to say about the Super Bowl
[20:10.000 --> 20:14.000]  and Sarah Palin coming up in the next segment.
[20:14.000 --> 20:16.000]  I want to open the phone to you.
[20:16.000 --> 20:19.000]  I'm Alex Jones from HomeGain.com.
[20:19.000 --> 20:22.000]  I'm Alex Jones from HomeGain.com.
[20:22.000 --> 20:25.000]  I'm Alex Jones from HomeGain.com.
[20:25.000 --> 20:28.000]  I want to open the phones up.
[20:28.000 --> 20:37.000]  Only for Australian, Chinese, Italians, people in New Zealand.
[20:37.000 --> 20:40.000]  Also, it's starting to happen in England
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  who have been specifically blocked
[20:42.000 --> 20:45.000]  from visiting infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[20:45.000 --> 20:48.000]  I mean, I have mainstream news articles and blogs
[20:48.000 --> 20:50.000]  out of New Zealand and Australia reporting.
[20:50.000 --> 20:53.000]  You can't go to my websites.
[20:53.000 --> 20:58.000]  Here is the infonews.co.nz.
[20:58.000 --> 21:01.000]  Internet censorship, major truth providing websites
[21:01.000 --> 21:04.000]  blocked by Asian Netcom to New Zealand users.
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  And this is just one article.
[21:06.000 --> 21:11.000]  It just goes through Telestar Clear,
[21:11.000 --> 21:15.000]  Vod Phone, World Exchange Communications, WUSH.
[21:15.000 --> 21:17.000]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[21:17.000 --> 21:22.000]  iHug, Telecom, it's all banned.
[21:22.000 --> 21:26.000]  And I was at Motties Thursday night.
[21:26.000 --> 21:27.000]  I whipped in.
[21:27.000 --> 21:28.000]  I had to come back to work.
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  I whipped in to get some Mexican food.
[21:30.000 --> 21:33.000]  And basically, everybody in there was a listener and a fan.
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  I mean, literally, everybody in there came over,
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  waved and said, hi, keep it up, Alex.
[21:37.000 --> 21:40.000]  And two people from New Zealand who were visiting,
[21:40.000 --> 21:49.000]  filmmakers, came over and said, man, New Zealand is on fire with you.
[21:49.000 --> 21:53.000]  And I get emails and stuff from New Zealand where there's big
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  banner hangs for infowars.com.
[21:55.000 --> 21:58.000]  You know, they say a profit is not known in his own country.
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  Well, we're very popular in the U.S.
[22:00.000 --> 22:03.000]  We're in the top 1,000 websites according to Alexa,
[22:03.000 --> 22:08.000]  but we're even higher rated in other foreign countries.
[22:08.000 --> 22:11.000]  So it's really amazing to have this going on.
[22:11.000 --> 22:14.000]  I mean, we get 4 million visitors,
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.000]  independent, separate IP addresses every week.
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.000]  To our two big websites.
[22:20.000 --> 22:23.000]  And the information is devastating to the New World Order.
[22:23.000 --> 22:27.000]  We understand the globalist operation.
[22:27.000 --> 22:33.000]  And this is happening through a coordinated global operation.
[22:33.000 --> 22:37.000]  The U.N. announced a week ago they want web censorship of
[22:37.000 --> 22:41.000]  quote extremist and anti-government information worldwide.
[22:41.000 --> 22:45.000]  Cass Sunstein, we covered this two weeks ago,
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  is writing white papers as the head.
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.000]  Regulations are at the White House.
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.000]  He's in line when Justice Stevens or Ginsburg leaves this year.
[22:53.000 --> 22:54.000]  They're both set to leave.
[22:54.000 --> 22:57.000]  He is in line to be the next Supreme Court justice.
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  He says you have no second amendment right.
[22:59.000 --> 23:01.000]  He says you have no right to free speech.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  We should ban conspiracy theories.
[23:03.000 --> 23:07.000]  He includes that into saying that man made global warming isn't real.
[23:07.000 --> 23:16.000]  Is it conspiracy theory?
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  And so it's not just my website.
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.000]  We read articles earlier in the week where mainline
[23:21.000 --> 23:24.000]  political websites are inaccessible in Australia.
[23:24.000 --> 23:29.000]  China has now banned us completely.
[23:29.000 --> 23:32.000]  Again, the train stations, the cities,
[23:32.000 --> 23:35.000]  the free city internet in London and in Sheffield,
[23:35.000 --> 23:38.000]  blocksinfowars.com and prisonplanet.com,
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  libraries everywhere.
[23:40.000 --> 23:45.000]  So we're being systematically blocked by software.
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  We've been put in a list of bad sites,
[23:47.000 --> 23:48.000]  but that's not enough.
[23:48.000 --> 23:52.000]  Now, entire giant telecoms are blocking us.
[23:52.000 --> 23:55.000]  This is a huge story.
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  Chinese-style net censorship.
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.000]  And then, in fact, guys, I couldn't find the article in my stack.
[24:01.000 --> 24:10.000]  Google Italy enforces draconian net censorship,
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.000]  or Italy installs Chinese-style censorship.
[24:13.000 --> 24:16.000]  It was the big Italian papers that you have to get a license.
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  That's a good thing to search.
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  You have to get a license now to be on the internet.
[24:20.000 --> 24:24.000]  The government has to approve you to have a website or a news site.
[24:24.000 --> 24:27.000]  I mean, that's literally Soviet or Nazi.
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.000]  Folks, there's so much evidence of this.
[24:29.000 --> 24:32.000]  It's happening to us right now in our own government,
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  in Time Magazine, in the New York Times,
[24:34.000 --> 24:37.000]  and the White House czar are calling for censorship,
[24:37.000 --> 24:40.000]  and they're calling for censorship of talk radio.
[24:40.000 --> 24:47.000]  Remember Michael Savage last year banned from going to England?
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  Remember the head of their home office saying,
[24:49.000 --> 24:53.000]  you're not welcome here?
[24:53.000 --> 24:57.000]  What about the members of the parliament in Sweden and other places
[24:57.000 --> 25:02.000]  are going to court next week for criticizing radical Muslims?
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.000]  Again, whether you agree with criticizing radical Muslims or not,
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  it's his free speech.
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  Everybody is beginning to be censored,
[25:09.000 --> 25:13.000]  but especially infowars.com and prismplanet.com,
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  because the system is in trouble.
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  Newspapers are going bankrupt.
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  Mainstream TV is going bankrupt.
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.000]  They're openly calling for censorship of the web and blogs
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  because they can't compete.
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  And you've got the diversity czar,
[25:28.000 --> 25:33.000]  you've got the science czar, the technologies czar,
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  all calling for censorship.
[25:35.000 --> 25:39.000]  Now, last year they had two different heads of cybersecurity resign.
[25:39.000 --> 25:46.000]  The first one resigned saying the Pentagon is taking over the internet.
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.000]  And so when you hear, oh, the house pass cybersecurity bill
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.000]  to fight Chinese hackers, it has nothing to do with that.
[25:53.000 --> 25:57.000]  If you actually read the bill, in fact, just search this term.
[25:57.000 --> 26:00.000]  Obama says he may shut off the internet to save it.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  Or should Obama control the internet?
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.000]  That's Mother Jones.
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.000]  Print that for me.
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  I don't want to just sit here and make these claims.
[26:08.000 --> 26:09.000]  I want to show you the articles.
[26:09.000 --> 26:11.000]  Go read the House bill.
[26:11.000 --> 26:15.000]  Read the Senate bill.
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.000]  China doesn't even have a net ID to get online.
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  They just block most sites.
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  This is more draconian than China.
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  The White House is calling for this.
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.000]  Do you understand this isn't a joke?
[26:28.000 --> 26:31.000]  And you may hate what I have to say.
[26:31.000 --> 26:36.000]  But if you don't support my free speech, you're going to lose yours.
[26:36.000 --> 26:37.000]  And there's Mother Jones headline.
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  Should Obama control the internet?
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  And then it breaks down the cybersecurity bill
[26:41.000 --> 26:43.000]  and how they had a cybersecurity resigned
[26:43.000 --> 26:46.000]  and how it's a police state takeover.
[26:46.000 --> 26:53.000]  That was from April 2nd, almost a year ago.
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.000]  What, 11 months ago, 10 and a half months ago.
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  This is from Friday.
[26:58.000 --> 27:02.000]  House passes cybersecurity bill.
[27:02.000 --> 27:05.000]  Police want backdoor to web users, private data,
[27:05.000 --> 27:10.000]  CNET news, just keeping your data indefinitely.
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  Internet censorship, major truth providing websites
[27:12.000 --> 27:19.000]  blocked by Asian Netcom to New Zealand users.
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.000]  Almost every major telecom, simultaneously, they list them.
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  We've been sent the screenshots.
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  You can't get there.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  Major international transport hub,
[27:32.000 --> 27:36.000]  censors political websites, prisonplanet.com.
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  While media accuses China of blacklisting
[27:38.000 --> 27:41.000]  censored information, censorship is taking place right here at home.
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  All establishment media outlets in the U.K.
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  spent most of the last week on China's censorship
[27:45.000 --> 27:46.000]  of political websites.
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.000]  Anticipation of the Olympic Games is from a year ago.
[27:49.000 --> 27:53.000]  They ignore the fact that London's street international,
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  one of the biggest transport hubs in the West,
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  has already implemented stringent filters
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  that block users from Wi-Fi service
[27:59.000 --> 28:02.000]  from accessing even mildly political websites.
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  Then it goes through prisonplanet being blocked,
[28:04.000 --> 28:07.000]  but then even other think progress,
[28:07.000 --> 28:11.000]  all these other mainstream websites being blocked.
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.000]  Do you know why this is happening?
[28:14.000 --> 28:18.000]  This is happening because when you Googled
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.000]  London bombing in 2005, the number one thing
[28:21.000 --> 28:25.000]  on Google News and on Google Web was prisonplanet.com.
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  How the government ran a drill of bombing
[28:27.000 --> 28:31.000]  the exact same buses and trains the exact same time.
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.000]  When you Google climate gate, we're number one,
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.000]  exposing these criminals.
[28:35.000 --> 28:38.000]  When you Google the Justice Department
[28:38.000 --> 28:42.000]  going after the Second Amendment, we come up first.
[28:42.000 --> 28:46.000]  On every issue, folks, I've made films
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.000]  that have been seen over 150 to 200 million times
[28:49.000 --> 28:50.000]  for free online.
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.000]  Obama deception, fall the Republic.
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.000]  The system is scared of what we're doing here.
[28:56.000 --> 29:06.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[29:06.000 --> 29:08.000]  you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[29:08.000 --> 29:11.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double
[29:11.000 --> 29:12.000]  or triple your electric bill.
[29:12.000 --> 29:15.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control
[29:15.000 --> 29:18.000]  how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[29:18.000 --> 29:21.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity
[29:21.000 --> 29:24.000]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  And now, new socialist legislation
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  is only compounding the problem.
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.000]  a threat to local grids.
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  Every year, thousands of families
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.000]  lose their power from weather-related onages.
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  Number five, a solar power generator
[29:37.000 --> 29:40.000]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  offered by Solutions from Science,
[29:44.000 --> 29:45.000]  one of my oldest sponsors.

[29:59.000 --> 30:02.000]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[30:02.000 --> 30:04.000]  If you're going into a battle
[30:04.000 --> 30:06.000]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm,
[30:06.000 --> 30:08.000]  how much ammunition do you want?
[30:08.000 --> 30:10.000]  My answer would be all I can get.
[30:10.000 --> 30:13.000]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones,
[30:13.000 --> 30:15.000]  food is your only ammunition.
[30:15.000 --> 30:17.000]  How much do you want? When do you want it?
[30:17.000 --> 30:20.000]  Now or after the battle starts, when will you need it?
[30:20.000 --> 30:23.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[30:23.000 --> 30:26.000]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[30:26.000 --> 30:28.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.000]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[30:31.000 --> 30:34.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[30:34.000 --> 30:38.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[30:38.000 --> 30:40.000]  How much will you need? We don't know.
[30:40.000 --> 30:42.000]  How much do you want? All you can get.
[30:42.000 --> 30:43.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[30:43.000 --> 30:46.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[30:46.000 --> 30:51.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633
[30:51.000 --> 30:54.000]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[30:54.000 --> 31:17.000]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[31:24.000 --> 31:29.000]  Call 1-800-691-6043
[31:54.000 --> 32:01.000]  This is Alex Jones with 5 Good Reasons You Should Consider Buying a Solar Power Generator.
[32:01.000 --> 32:02.000]  Number 1.
[32:02.000 --> 32:05.000]  New Climate Legislation Could Easily Double or Triple Your Electric Bill.
[32:05.000 --> 32:06.000]  Number 2.
[32:06.000 --> 32:11.000]  Our New Energy Tsar Wants To Control How Much Power Your Electric Company Allows You To Have.
[32:11.000 --> 32:12.000]  It's True.
[32:12.000 --> 32:17.000]  Total Government Control Of Electricity In The Name Of Smart Grid Technology Is Coming.
[32:17.000 --> 32:18.000]  Number 3.
[32:18.000 --> 32:21.000]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[32:21.000 --> 32:25.000]  And now, a new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[32:25.000 --> 32:26.000]  Number 4.
[32:26.000 --> 32:29.000]  Dangerous Weather Is Always A Threat To Local Grids.
[32:29.000 --> 32:33.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[32:33.000 --> 32:34.000]  Number 5.
[32:34.000 --> 32:38.000]  A Solar Power Generator Provides Powerful Backup Insurance And Peace Of Mind.
[32:38.000 --> 32:41.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science,
[32:41.000 --> 32:43.000]  one of my old sponsors.
[32:43.000 --> 32:47.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[32:47.000 --> 32:49.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[32:49.000 --> 32:56.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[33:20.000 --> 33:24.000]  Alright, I'm going to give out the toll-free number.
[33:24.000 --> 33:30.000]  And if you have tried to get on infowars.com or prisonplanet.com, there's many different types of censorship.
[33:30.000 --> 33:36.000]  There's libraries, colleges, corporations, but that's their right.
[33:36.000 --> 33:46.000]  Governments, China, Australia, New Zealand, big telecoms are blacklistinginfowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[33:46.000 --> 33:54.000]  City-installed Wi-Fi networks that you pay for with your tax money, censoring my two main websites.
[33:54.000 --> 34:00.000]  People in China and New Zealand and Australia can still go to prisonplanet.tv.
[34:00.000 --> 34:05.000]  I need people in Australia, New Zealand, Italy, and other countries where we're being censored.
[34:05.000 --> 34:08.000]  And the governments have announced they've started censoring.
[34:08.000 --> 34:15.000]  Not just me, WikiLeaks that puts out all these government documents is being censored all over the place.
[34:15.000 --> 34:23.000]  We got hacked really bad and professionally when we were exposing the swine flu as a hoax back in April of last year.
[34:23.000 --> 34:30.000]  I want to give the number out to people who have specifically been blocked or censored 888-201-2244.
[34:30.000 --> 34:35.000]  Just dial your country code and then 888-201-2244.
[34:35.000 --> 34:39.000]  Here is that number again, 888-201-2244.
[34:39.000 --> 34:47.000]  Also, send screenshots of how you've been blocked to showtipsandinfowars.com.
[34:47.000 --> 34:50.000]  We're doing big reports throughout the week on this.
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.000]  Remember, Obama Informations are calls for banning free speech.
[34:53.000 --> 34:58.000]  That was back from January 14th, just a month ago or so or less.
[34:58.000 --> 35:02.000]  Time Magazine pushes draconian internet licensing plan.
[35:02.000 --> 35:06.000]  This is from February 3rd, just four days ago.
[35:06.000 --> 35:13.000]  Death of the internet, censorship bills in UK, Australia, US aimed to block undesirable websites.
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.000]  That's from December 17th.
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  See, it's now happening.
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  Do you understand?
[35:19.000 --> 35:22.000]  And they're saying they want to restrict talk radio.
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  This isn't a joke.
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  Why is this happening?
[35:26.000 --> 35:32.000]  It is on record that the G20, the head bankers of the 20 nations,
[35:32.000 --> 35:37.000]  have stolen over 50 trillion worldwide, 28 trillion in the US.
[35:37.000 --> 35:38.000]  They are robbing the planet.
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  They have committed massive crimes.
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  There's open talk of them being indicted or arrested.
[35:43.000 --> 35:48.000]  And they are the main institutions funding the shutdown of freedom of speech on the web.
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  It is really happening.
[35:50.000 --> 35:58.000]  And the newspapers and mainstream TV, they like it because alternative speech and news is kicking their butt.
[35:58.000 --> 36:04.000]  And I have a stack of articles here from all over England and the US,
[36:04.000 --> 36:09.000]  where police in Tampa and New York City and everywhere,
[36:09.000 --> 36:13.000]  someone will be videotaping police beating somebody up 100 yards away,
[36:13.000 --> 36:18.000]  and the cops will come up and beat them up and charge them for wiretapping.
[36:18.000 --> 36:21.000]  When there's no perception of privacy on the street,
[36:21.000 --> 36:24.000]  same way the government can videotape you.
[36:24.000 --> 36:25.000]  They are scared.
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  Big brother is on the ropes.
[36:27.000 --> 36:28.000]  That's why they're doing this.
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.000]  So we need everybody in other countries that are having us blocked.
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.000]  You need to create your own blogs or sites separate from your own.
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.000]  If you're worried about it getting shut down and doppelganger.
[36:39.000 --> 36:45.000]  Copy everything we do at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com up onto those sites.
[36:45.000 --> 36:48.000]  Post it on your Facebook, Google, Myspace.
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.000]  Either we hang together or we all hang separate.
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.000]  Now, I noticed the phone lines are loading, but mainly from the US.
[36:55.000 --> 36:58.000]  We're always getting calls from New Zealand, Italy, China.
[36:58.000 --> 37:02.000]  I got calls throughout the week from China where we're banned.
[37:02.000 --> 37:06.000]  Are these callers specifically on censorship?
[37:06.000 --> 37:09.000]  Not being able to visit infowars or prisonplanet.
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  Well, I'm not going to go to them then.
[37:11.000 --> 37:19.000]  These are specifically open phones for people who have experienced it.
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  My friends, we're being robbed.
[37:21.000 --> 37:22.000]  It is a concerted effort.
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.000]  In fact, here is news.co.au of Australia.
[37:26.000 --> 37:31.000]  Secret summit of top bankers.
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  This came out on Saturday yesterday.
[37:35.000 --> 37:38.000]  The world's top central bankers began arriving in Australia yesterday.
[37:38.000 --> 37:44.000]  As renewed fears about the strength of the global economic recovery gripped world share markets.
[37:44.000 --> 37:51.000]  See, secret banks meeting secretly.
[37:51.000 --> 37:54.000]  And the internet ends compartmentalized news.
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.000]  You're listening all over the US on MNFM globally on shortwave internet satellite.
[37:58.000 --> 38:04.000]  You're now hearing me talk about how banks are bankers are meeting secretly in Australia.
[38:04.000 --> 38:08.000]  I remember a UN summit with a secret treaty in 2000.
[38:08.000 --> 38:15.000]  In fact, remember Obama last year it came out in the Associated Press secret internet treaty to restrict free speech.
[38:15.000 --> 38:22.000]  In fact, pull that up for folks, Obama supports secret UN internet treaty, secret UN copyright treaty.
[38:22.000 --> 38:26.000]  But you read it, it's an end to freedom of speech, nothing to do with copyright.
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.000]  Just like they're saying cyber security, and all the major nations are saying the same thing,
[38:31.000 --> 38:37.000]  is meant to stop hacking, but when you actually read the bill, it's about attacking free speech.
[38:37.000 --> 38:42.000]  Representatives from 24 central banks and monetary authorities, including the US Federal Reserve
[38:42.000 --> 38:48.000]  and European Central Bank landed in Sydney to meet tomorrow at a secret location the Herald Sun reports.
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  Secret.
[38:50.000 --> 38:58.000]  They don't want us communicating with each other worldwide and knowing what's going on.
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  Here's another one they don't want you to know about.
[39:01.000 --> 39:10.000]  Reuters, Bayer to pay 1.5 million in second lawsuit over GM Rice, Frankfurt, Germany.
[39:10.000 --> 39:16.000]  Bayer was ordered by a jury in the United States to pay 1.5 million in damages to three farmers for losses they incurred
[39:16.000 --> 39:23.000]  because of contamination of Bayer's genetically modified rice, the second in about 500 similar cases pending.
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  A genetically engineered rice.
[39:25.000 --> 39:33.000]  They've got rice and corn that a whole bunch of GMO companies do that grow live HIV virus in it,
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  that grow live sterilants to quote sterilize men in it.
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  That's Associated Press.
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.000]  The new smart stack by Monsanto has eight genetic traits.
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.000]  Six of them live pesticide in the corn, so bugs won't eat it.
[39:46.000 --> 39:51.000]  But so when you eat it, they say it's fine, though all the major studies show it causes organ failure.
[39:51.000 --> 39:54.000]  That's mainstream news.
[39:54.000 --> 40:05.000]  But again, all they want is a bunch of corporate shills on radio, TV and print who won't tell you about this.
[40:05.000 --> 40:10.000]  This is the type of information that we are dealing with.
[40:10.000 --> 40:20.000]  And again, I want all these callers to know Bill, Bill, Joe, Drew, Mike, Bill, James, if they're not specifically on internet censorship, guys.
[40:20.000 --> 40:23.000]  Oh, so caller 789R.
[40:23.000 --> 40:29.000]  Okay, good because I just want to leave the phones open because I get these calls throughout the last two weeks from New Zealand,
[40:29.000 --> 40:35.000]  Australia, Italy and China where they can't go to my site.
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  It's now confirmed in the news.
[40:37.000 --> 40:40.000]  I want to hear from people that this directly has happened to.
[40:40.000 --> 40:43.000]  Mike in Florida, did this happen to you?
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  Yeah, Alex, how's it going, man?
[40:45.000 --> 40:46.000]  Well, not too good.
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  I mean, it's getting late.
[40:48.000 --> 40:51.000]  That means they're getting ready to drop the hammer that they're now testing internet censorship.
[40:51.000 --> 40:57.000]  And if we don't get on top of this and create a firestorm, they're going to set the precedent and continue.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  Well, I know that.
[40:59.000 --> 41:05.000]  And the reason I'm calling, and we know universities are test markets for a lot of things that they're working on,
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  trying to target the youth and whatnot.
[41:07.000 --> 41:12.000]  But I remember going back about four years ago when I was at school at the University of Central Florida,
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  I used to try to log on to InfoWars throughout the day.
[41:15.000 --> 41:19.000]  And in the different computer labs and the libraries, they always had InfoWars,
[41:19.000 --> 41:25.000]  a little icon would pop up and say access restricted due to hate speech.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  Yeah, they have four designations.
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  They have four designations.
[41:29.000 --> 41:32.000]  Gambling, porn, hacking, and hate.
[41:32.000 --> 41:37.000]  And we're always listed under hacking and hate when we're against hate.
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.000]  But even if we were hateful, it's free speech.
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  Yep, that's exactly it.
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.000]  And this is not even just right now.
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  We obviously see what they're doing with the infrastructure, with the internet.
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  And I have friends that work in IT professionally.
[41:51.000 --> 41:56.000]  And I may mention to them about something I heard on your show a while back where a caller called into you
[41:56.000 --> 42:02.000]  and he said that he had a friend that was watching all these weird government type of routers popping up.
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  And I mentioned it to one of my buddies that works in IT.
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  And he said, yeah, actually, you're right.
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  In the last year, all of these new hubs keep popping up,
[42:10.000 --> 42:17.000]  where it's just redirecting information through the government systems that are just coming online.
[42:17.000 --> 42:25.000]  So this is all over the place, Alex, and they are actually building, like you say, an infrastructure to shut us down.
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  Hi, Harry, and I appreciate your call.
[42:27.000 --> 42:32.000]  I mean, here's the daily news. Internet censorship is on the rise.
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.000]  Copyright treaty is classified for national security, but it leaked.
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.000]  We got a copy, nothing to do with copyright, total restriction of free speech.
[42:40.000 --> 42:43.000]  Italy contemplates web restrictions.
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  This is a month old. They've now implemented them.
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  That was earlier this week.
[42:47.000 --> 42:52.000]  I mean, folks, first they came for info wars, next they came for you.
[42:52.000 --> 42:55.000]  They're doing very bad things.
[42:55.000 --> 43:19.000]  Off-short global banks are taking over. We'll be back.
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.000]  Overlongs.com
[44:25.000 --> 44:28.000]  The fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[44:28.000 --> 44:35.000]  The criminal off-short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches.
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[44:43.000 --> 44:48.000]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[44:48.000 --> 44:53.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[44:53.000 --> 44:59.000]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[44:59.000 --> 45:05.000]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[45:05.000 --> 45:08.000]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[45:08.000 --> 45:13.000]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[45:13.000 --> 45:18.000]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from infowars.com.
[45:18.000 --> 45:23.000]  We also have some specials when you get some of our other films have price when you order Shadow Government.
[45:23.000 --> 45:26.000]  A new level in production quality and in information.
[45:26.000 --> 45:34.000]  It exposes how a casual society surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.

[46:00.000 --> 46:03.000]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[46:03.000 --> 46:08.000]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[46:08.000 --> 46:13.000]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[46:13.000 --> 46:17.000]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[46:17.000 --> 46:20.000]  Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[46:20.000 --> 46:25.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[46:25.000 --> 46:31.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[46:31.000 --> 46:34.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[46:34.000 --> 46:40.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[46:40.000 --> 46:43.000]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[46:43.000 --> 46:46.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[46:46.000 --> 46:54.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[46:54.000 --> 46:58.000]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[46:58.000 --> 47:08.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:28.000 --> 47:37.000]  In a top story out of New Zealand, Internet censorship, major truth providing websites blocked by Asian Netcom to New Zealand users.
[47:37.000 --> 47:47.000]  Paul Watson is doing a big report in the morning, but at the bottom, Paul put a bunch of links to all the mainstream news where they're admitting they want to censor the web and are now launching it.
[47:47.000 --> 47:54.000]  China, that Microsoft runs their censorship, Bill Gates a week and a half ago. Remember, in fact, pull this up.
[47:54.000 --> 48:00.000]  Bill Gates supports Chinese censorship. Pull that up. Bill Gates says Chinese censorship good.
[48:00.000 --> 48:07.000]  They built the grid. It's just so amazing.
[48:08.000 --> 48:14.000]  Here's the Times Online. An assault on Italy's bloggers, Times of London.
[48:14.000 --> 48:19.000]  Italy's leaders barely understand world processors, let alone the web.
[48:19.000 --> 48:24.000]  Now they've turned against the country's bloggers. Here it is.
[48:24.000 --> 48:31.000]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, they are coming after the web in a big way all over the world in the last two weeks.
[48:31.000 --> 48:38.000]  It isn't just China. The White House and Cybersecurity Bill calls for a net ID.
[48:38.000 --> 48:44.000]  Notice for four years, all the new Microsoft operating systems have built in a thumb scanner to be able to get online.
[48:44.000 --> 48:50.000]  Web censorship in China. Not a problem says Bill Gates, London Guardian.
[48:50.000 --> 48:55.000]  See what I'm saying here? You say it can't happen here. It is happening here.
[48:55.000 --> 49:01.000]  Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, they've all helped China censor.
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.000]  Google was set up by the CIA and NQTEL.
[49:07.000 --> 49:13.000]  We have the videos of the documents up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com right now.
[49:13.000 --> 49:19.000]  And the House passed the Cybersecurity Act, the total Pentagon takeover of the Internet.
[49:23.000 --> 49:30.000]  And they're doing this because they know the American people are saying no to the carbon taxes, no to the fake flu,
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.000]  no to the police state, no to open borders, no to the New World Order.
[49:34.000 --> 49:42.000]  And it's the same thing worldwide. People are actually looking at the real private global corporate government that runs our planet
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  and not at the puppet politicians.
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.000]  Look at all the polls. Congress has a 12% approval rating.
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.000]  Parliament has like a 15% approval rating in England.
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.000]  The people are mad. They're awake.
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.000]  And so the system is panicking coming in to selectively censor.
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  Let's go to Picky in New Zealand.
[49:59.000 --> 50:04.000]  Picky, I'm getting hundreds of phone calls, emails, documents sent to me.
[50:04.000 --> 50:15.000]  It's in the Kiwi news, the New Zealand news that they are censoring infowars and prisonplanet and WikiLeaks and mainstream Australian political websites.
[50:15.000 --> 50:18.000]  What is going on? Have you seen censorship?
[50:18.000 --> 50:22.000]  Hey, Alex, it's great to talk to you.
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  For the first time, I'm a subscriber, have been for two years.
[50:26.000 --> 50:27.000]  Thank you.
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  And you're correct.
[50:29.000 --> 50:38.000]  I just got up this morning. I've been trying to get through to infowars and I just can't get through.
[50:38.000 --> 50:43.000]  I can't download any of the videos. I can't see any movies.
[50:43.000 --> 50:55.000]  And I had to go on to GCN to actually find out what was actually happening and a bit of a Google search.
[50:55.000 --> 51:01.000]  Yeah, to be clear, you can't get. That's what we're hearing. You can't get to infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[51:01.000 --> 51:05.000]  You've got to go to shopcastgcnlive.com to get the internet stream.
[51:05.000 --> 51:10.000]  Yes. Yes. And I'm really angry about that, you know, because this is the first time it's happened.
[51:10.000 --> 51:15.000]  And it's just been a problem as from yesterday.
[51:15.000 --> 51:19.000]  So it's great to know actually really what's actually happening in the background.
[51:19.000 --> 51:24.000]  You're saying, so, yeah, I'm angry. So, yeah, that's, that's where I am.
[51:24.000 --> 51:29.000]  Well, what we need everybody in Australia, New Zealand, Italy, China and England,
[51:29.000 --> 51:32.000]  because it's happening all over those countries that we know of.
[51:32.000 --> 51:36.000]  And we're getting calls from Canada. I mean, literally hundreds of emails.
[51:36.000 --> 51:42.000]  I opened my email and it's trouble ticket photo. I mean, camera shots.
[51:42.000 --> 51:47.000]  It is a snapshot screenshots. It is massive.
[51:47.000 --> 51:51.000]  Everybody's saying they can't get to infowars or prisonplanet.
[51:51.000 --> 51:57.000]  What is the in game dot com infowars.net try.
[51:57.000 --> 52:00.000]  We're going to have to get out a whole list of my backup sites.
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  We built these for this.
[52:02.000 --> 52:08.000]  But again, we've got a list from the New Zealand news.
[52:08.000 --> 52:16.000]  Thank God they're reporting it and it says that the majority of major internet service providers are now blocking the site.
[52:16.000 --> 52:19.000]  Who is who is your provider?
[52:19.000 --> 52:24.000]  My one slingshot.
[52:24.000 --> 52:28.000]  My God. And now, now a lot of the things were being sent.
[52:28.000 --> 52:32.000]  Show the message that comes up saying this site is restricted.
[52:32.000 --> 52:34.000]  What message are you getting?
[52:34.000 --> 52:38.000]  It's just not working.
[52:38.000 --> 52:43.000]  I've always used to go on to your website and I could download stuff.
[52:43.000 --> 52:46.000]  I could watch and listen to the radio show.
[52:46.000 --> 52:52.000]  This is the first time it's actually happened where I can't even go on all the other websites that you have.
[52:52.000 --> 52:55.000]  And I'm getting the same problem.
[52:55.000 --> 53:04.000]  Well, we need New Zealanders to realize this is tyranny, the Aussies, the Italians, the British, the Chinese.
[53:04.000 --> 53:08.000]  We need everybody to create copies of infowars and prisonplanet.
[53:08.000 --> 53:11.000]  I've always said people can post our articles, post our videos.
[53:11.000 --> 53:15.000]  It's all copyright free for nonprofit educational purposes.
[53:15.000 --> 53:24.000]  It is now up to everyone to copy our information everywhere because this is a concerted global operation.
[53:24.000 --> 53:27.000]  I mean, look, here's the news of Australia reporting.
[53:27.000 --> 53:33.000]  Secret summit of top bankers, news.com.au, meeting in secret.
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  The bankers meeting in secret.
[53:35.000 --> 53:36.000]  I mean, my God.
[53:36.000 --> 53:44.000]  And now they passed the cyber security bill that openly says they'll shut down the web.
[53:44.000 --> 53:48.000]  It's definitely scary.
[53:48.000 --> 53:49.000]  Well, God bless you.
[53:49.000 --> 53:50.000]  Is there anything else?
[53:50.000 --> 53:51.000]  Yeah.
[53:51.000 --> 53:52.000]  Anything else?
[53:52.000 --> 53:53.000]  Just thank you very much.
[53:53.000 --> 53:54.000]  You've got a great show.
[53:54.000 --> 53:55.000]  I love listening to it.
[53:55.000 --> 54:00.000]  And your hot head down here in New Zealand.
[54:00.000 --> 54:01.000]  Yeah.
[54:01.000 --> 54:06.000]  I ran into two people from New Zealand in a Mexican food restaurant and they said New Zealand's on fire with infowars.
[54:06.000 --> 54:07.000]  Oh, yeah.
[54:07.000 --> 54:08.000]  Absolutely.
[54:08.000 --> 54:09.000]  Absolutely.
[54:09.000 --> 54:13.000]  I listen to your show every day and I just can't get enough of it.
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  God bless you, sir.
[54:15.000 --> 54:18.000]  Folks, this is so devastating to know.
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  I mean, we've known it's coming.
[54:20.000 --> 54:25.000]  It's one thing to have corporations, universities quote free government broadband.
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  They're offering in the cities with your tax money.
[54:27.000 --> 54:31.000]  It's not free to be banned all over on those, including most US systems.
[54:31.000 --> 54:37.000]  But to now be banned for one billion, 300 million people totally banned in China.
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  We've confirmed that.
[54:39.000 --> 54:47.000]  Banned almost over every system in Australia, Italy, New Zealand and all over England, literally
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  hundreds of emails per hour.
[54:49.000 --> 54:50.000]  I mean, I open it.
[54:50.000 --> 54:51.000]  It's just solid.
[54:51.000 --> 54:52.000]  Solid.
[54:52.000 --> 54:53.000]  We're banned.
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  I mean, we are banned, ladies and gentlemen.
[54:55.000 --> 55:02.000]  Do you understand what's happening here?
[55:02.000 --> 55:05.000]  You know why they finally dropped the hammer because of climate.
[55:05.000 --> 55:06.000]  That's the number.
[55:06.000 --> 55:07.000]  And they say that in the news.
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.000]  They say we've got a sense of the web lies about climate change.
[55:11.000 --> 55:16.000]  We've got a they're calling for resting Lord Monkton in England in the Guardian for saying
[55:16.000 --> 55:20.000]  manmade climate change isn't real because all the documents being coming out on the
[55:20.000 --> 55:24.000]  Internet confirmed to be real that they know the earth isn't heating and they know man
[55:24.000 --> 55:27.000]  isn't bad and they know the carbon dioxide isn't bad.
[55:27.000 --> 55:31.000]  They don't want you, the people to have a voice.
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  This is about silencing you.
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  We are too successful.
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  You are too successful.
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  They tried their co entail pro against us.
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  They've tried their defamation and demonization.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  It isn't working.
[55:44.000 --> 55:51.000]  So now they're coming in with hardcore Nazi style censorship.
[55:51.000 --> 55:52.000]  Bill in Canada.
[55:52.000 --> 55:57.000]  Have you been censored?
[55:57.000 --> 56:00.000]  Bill.
[56:00.000 --> 56:01.000]  Okay.
[56:01.000 --> 56:02.000]  He hung up.
[56:02.000 --> 56:03.000]  Let's talk to James in Washington state.
[56:03.000 --> 56:04.000]  James, you're on the air.
[56:04.000 --> 56:05.000]  Have you been censored?
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  Yes, I have, Alex.
[56:07.000 --> 56:08.000]  All right.
[56:08.000 --> 56:09.000]  Tell us quickly.
[56:09.000 --> 56:10.000]  Okay.
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  It was a few years back at a public high school and they sent you.
[56:14.000 --> 56:19.000]  And the reason was that calls to violence.
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  And there are no calls to violence.
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  How long have you been listening to the show?
[56:23.000 --> 56:24.000]  Let's see.
[56:24.000 --> 56:27.000]  Since around 2002, I think.
[56:27.000 --> 56:30.000]  And have you ever heard me call for violence?
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  No, you never do.
[56:32.000 --> 56:36.000]  I say that whoever fires first wins.
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  But again, calls to violence.
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  You heard the last guy from a college.
[56:40.000 --> 56:41.000]  Same thing.
[56:41.000 --> 56:48.000]  This is in these big databases they pay for to quote, have safe surfing and were listed.
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  I mean, but now that's not enough.
[56:50.000 --> 56:53.000]  Now the government is going to come in with censorship.
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  What do you think of that, James?
[56:55.000 --> 56:58.000]  It's lame and I hate it, but I love your show.
[56:58.000 --> 57:01.000]  And are you going to release that book anytime soon?
[57:01.000 --> 57:05.000]  It's a 19, 84, 1776.
[57:05.000 --> 57:11.000]  You know, I got behind on the book, but we are looking at publishing a paper paper.
[57:11.000 --> 57:16.000]  That's that we send the file to people so they can print it around the country.
[57:16.000 --> 57:19.000]  We are gearing up and getting ready to be shut down on the internet.
[57:19.000 --> 57:22.000]  All right, we're going to come back with the next hour.
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  Continue with this in your calls.
[57:24.000 --> 57:27.000]  888-201-2244.
[57:27.000 --> 57:30.000]  Either we all hang together or we hang separate.
[57:30.000 --> 57:33.000]  They are shutting down freedom on the web.
[57:33.000 --> 57:38.000]  They are shutting down mainline talk radio all over the world.
[57:38.000 --> 57:41.000]  Internet streams to mainline talk radios being shut down.
[57:41.000 --> 57:44.000]  Will we stand together or will we go quietly into tyranny?
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  Will we fall to tyranny?
[57:46.000 --> 58:11.000]  We'll be right back.
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  Then select the best realtor for you.
[58:19.000 --> 58:22.000]  Go to homegain.com and get an instant home value estimate.
[58:22.000 --> 58:25.000]  You comparable homes and check out street views.

[58:28.000 --> 58:30.000]  and contains a wealth of information.
[58:30.000 --> 58:33.000]  Like their home improvement tool that helps you determine which home improvements

[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  Red alert, red alert, red alert when they really start censoring in mass
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  and the reports are pouring in from Canada, the U.S., Australia, England, China,
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  Italy that we are being censored.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  We're going to go to Jerry and others coming up in the next segment at 6 after.
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  Cox Communications came up years ago blocking info wars in prisonplanet.com
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  When people complain, they then turn it back on.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  And that's the issue.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  If we don't boycott now, if we don't say no now, if we don't stand up now,
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  and if we don't go against these people, they're going to win.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  So you threaten to pull your contract for service with these companies?
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  This is the most serious issue there is, free speech,
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  because next comes the Second Amendment if they get rid of the First Amendment.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  Free speech is paramount, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  And you buy a service, they claim they're not censoring and they block.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  But now we have governments calling for blocking.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  And what you do is you take the infowars.com and prisonplanet.com articles
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  that are up there right now about censorship.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  You take the ones that we're putting out tomorrow morning and infowars.com
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  and prisonplanet.com and you get them out to everybody.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  You post them on Facebook, you post them on MySpace, you send them out on Twitter,
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  you make videos on YouTube about it.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  Everybody stand up and say, we're not putting up with Chinese-style net censorship.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  The White House is now calling for it.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  I want to hear more testimonies, 888-201-2244.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  If you're in the U.S. or Canada or any of those countries I mentioned,
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  that's what's pouring in of where you can't get to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  What does that tell you?
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  They've used the mainstream media, they've used fake alternative media.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  As the White House regulations are, Cass Sunstein said they would pose as alternative media
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  to attack me, to attack others because they know they've lost all credibility.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  They try to get us all infighting with each other.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  That's not working.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  They're getting more and more desperate to the point of they've had MSNBC and
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  Chris Matthews people down here with some big hit piece on me coming up in April.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  Now I'm standing up for my family and freedom here folks, but my question is,
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  are you going to stand up for your family?
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  The real war isn't about who's going to win this football game tonight.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  That you're so concerned about.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  And the destiny, it's the destiny of this republic, of this constitution, of this society.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  Now again, the key here is the fact that they're now coming in with the censorship.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  The fact that they're now not just eating around the edges and beta testing this,
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  that they're coming out in the open, means that they are getting ready to move big time.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  And Obama's announced he's in control of all the governors.
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  He's announced Northcom, Homeland Security, troops to be used in the U.S.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  They are testing to see if they can get away with this.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  And if we scream bloody murder and people file lawsuits and people protest,
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  and it only makes our information against the world government that much more popular,
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  they will back off.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  But they're definitely getting ready to drop the hammer right now.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  So Jerry in California, who can't get through Cox and others,
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  we're going to talk to you coming up.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  We've had Cox communications over the years.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  We've gotten their letters.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  They send people saying, you can't visit this hate site.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  Hate site?
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  What have we been covering here?
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  The bill of rights, the constitution, not letting offshore banks have secret meetings
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  to run our life and run our society.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  We're the good guys.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  We're not the banks that robbed you blind.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  We're not the BATF shutting down gun shows without laws all over the United States.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  Not even, not just the town where I live.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  They don't want you to know what they're doing.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  And cybersecurity is 15 bases.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  One of them San Antonio mainstream news has tried to go down there and take photos.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  Police come out and arrest them.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  This is the takeover of our society.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  Period.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  I just can't believe it's actually happening.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  But they're openly announcing they want to do it.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  We have the White House saying it.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  We have the British news saying it.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you got to get the stories we put out every day.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  You got to get the free videos while they're free online.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  All the Republic, Obama deception at YouTube and Google, everywhere else.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  You got to get them out to everybody.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  You got to take this serious like it's precious because I think we're hurting them so bad.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  Even if we protest them, they're going to incrementally shut everything down.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  Will we go quietly into the night like Germany, like Russia, like China?
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  It's true.
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:59.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  And we need everybody to screenshot the message you're getting.
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  Send it to showtipsandinfowars.com.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  Because we're going to do big reports throughout the week.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  It is now come.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  We have all the diversities ours.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  The regulations are all of them saying they want to strict talk radio on the internet.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  We're going to do big reports throughout the week.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  It is now come.
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  We have all the diversities ours.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  The regulations are all of them saying they want to strict talk radio on the internet.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  It's now happening.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  Mark dies two weeks ago went out on the streets of San Diego.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  90% of people or more he talked to said ban free speech, ban the criticism of Obama.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  This is what they brainwashed our country into.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  This is what's happening.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  We've got a guest coming up in the next segment, a bunch of other news.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jerry in California.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  Jerry, tell us about the censorship of infowars.com you've seen.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  Okay, here it is.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  I was watching you.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  I'm a member.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  I'm logged in.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  I'm also a veteran.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  Hey, so I'm watching the stream here in Firefox.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  And it was about, I logged in about nine after the last hour.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  And then about half past the hour, the stream was stopped.
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  So I turned on iTunes.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  I still get, I tried three more, two more browsers, Internet Explorer and the other one.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  I don't know.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  But anyway, the stream dropped, but I can still get the picture.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  Well, did you hear the caller from New Zealand who can't even get to infowars.com?
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  From that, you know, when I get down with you, I'm going to burn the wires of Cox because
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  I'm going to call tomorrow.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  I'm going to call customer Cox resolution team.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  Anybody wants the number?
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  I'll give it here in San Diego.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  Okay, it's 1-800-218-1021.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  Jerry, God bless you.
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  I'm going to jump.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  Robert in Texas, you're on the air.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  Oh, what's going on, man?
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  Have you experienced censorship of getting to my websites?
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  Absolutely.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  I go to state school here in Texas.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  It's one that's actually kind of a federal fusion center for police training and stuff
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  like that as well.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  Sam Houston?
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  Yeah.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  Yeah.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  Well, I worked there and also go to school, but you'll love this.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  I can't get your streaming videos and so forth, but I can get pornography.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  Isn't that beautiful?
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  Yeah.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  You can't get Alex Jones, who is on over 70 AM and FM stations, who just covers the news
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:55.800]  but breaks it all down.
[1:08:55.800 --> 1:08:56.800]  You can't get me.
[1:08:56.800 --> 1:09:02.000]  Now, we've known about universities and corporations and all of this lying about our site to do
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  that.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  And governments are doing it.
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  And Obama is openly calling for it.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  And now we're being banned.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  Notice how it's all happening simultaneously since the UN called for this eight days ago.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  You know what's funny is, and this is the scary part.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  Last time I was out with some people who are, you know, they think they're part of the
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  establishment deal.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  And we were talking about this whole thing.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  And, you know, and I posed this and, you know, I was like, yeah, you know, there's, there's
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  a lot of changes going on.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  And, you know, most of this is taking away our rights.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  And they were like, well, you know, we really need to kind of look at things like that for
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  safety.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  And I just looked at these.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  My wife, of course, just went, oh, God, you know, here we go.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  But yeah, the safety is so the foreign banks have already stolen more money than we could
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  ever pay back through fraud.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  We're screwed.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  And the answer is shut Alex Jones down.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  And, you know, we even went into that conversation.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  And I told them about the 28 million or 28 trillion, excuse me, that they got out of the
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  treasury so far.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  And, you know, once again, the part of the establishment reaction is, well, no, I read
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  an article that it was only one trillion and they're getting paid back right now.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  And they made $2 billion last month in interest.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  Oh, but see, that's the red herring.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  Even MSNBC admitted last week, it's 23.7.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  That's a five month old number from Bloomberg.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  But the 700 billion they did pay back because they loaned it out to themselves 10 times through
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  fractional reserve banking.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  That was just a line of credit.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  They didn't have anything to do with the derivative swaps.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  Then you go and try to explain a derivative to somebody and they're, they just look at
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  you like, oh, that's how long have we been banned at the big law enforcement center?
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  I'll say about a year.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  I'd say it used to, I could get you on, on the site, but then it would drop off, you
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  know, after about five or 10 minutes.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  But now I just can't even get streaming video.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  So what I have to do is I went and got a sprint card.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  Now I can get you on Sprint.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  So do this, do this.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  Don't give in to them because if they win incrementally, you know, they know how to
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  domesticate us.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  If they do this and we don't stand up, if they probe and we don't stand up, they win.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  Tell everybody about info wars.com.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  God bless you, Robert.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  Take care, my friend Herman in New York.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  You're on the air.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  Hello, Allison, you hear me?
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  Yes, sir.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  Yes.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  In my formal college last year, I tried to visit a personplanet.com and it was actually
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  censored saying that it was for just tasteful content or, or like dangerous content.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  It just wasn't allowed.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  And I noticed suddenly I even try to visit mainstream sites and it says that they're
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  doing it to a bunch of people.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  Yeah.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  It's not even just personplanet.com.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  It's a lot of websites, other websites I don't want to promote, but just a lot of other
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  websites that have the truth like you do.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  And, and they were all banned.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  I was wondering if it was just personplanet.com and it wasn't.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  It wasn't.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  It was.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  I mean, this has been going on for a decade at least.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  They have a database, different companies sell to quote, protect you.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  It's a web filter.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  That's not, that's only the tip of the iceberg.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  One billion, 300 million people can't get to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com now in
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  China, but it's not just China.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  Simultaneously in the last 10 days or so was the first few days I ignored it until hundreds
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  of emails came in.
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  It's Australia.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  It's New Zealand.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  It's China.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  It's Italy.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  And then I have all the mainstream articles where they're all announcing that they're
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  now censoring.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  See, I mean, I have articles from this week where Australia is censoring people running
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  against mayors who are about to win.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  I mean, they're doing whatever they want, sir.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  I appreciate your call, Herman.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  Let's talk to Bill in Wisconsin.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  Bill, are you being censored?
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  I was visiting our local sheriff.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  I'm a county board supervisor and I was visiting because I was concerned about what we should
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  do about the census coming up, how people should react to it.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  And, you know, I had asked him, I should take a look at Radigan on prisonplanet.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  Okay.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  And we also have a local attorney that set up a website with a lot of your stuff and
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  he's now come out in the open.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  And he said he can't get that type of information.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  So, so again, the, again, the sheriff, the sheriff, and you're part of the government
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  and you're going in to show the sheriff and he isn't allowed to see it.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  Land of the free home of the brave.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  Better keep people away from Alex Jones because he'll actually tell you the truth.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  See, we're telling the truth against their crimes.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  And so they're desperate to shut us down.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  Yeah.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  How big a deal do you think this is that simultaneously in Europe and China and the Pacific, we have
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  been banned?
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  Well, it's obviously huge.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  And I, like you say, it looks like the situation is coming down.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  And always said when they start censoring the web, big time, look out.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  You have said that over the years, that's for sure.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  I can't believe it's now happening.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  It's now happening.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  Yeah.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  I'm going to the IT director for the county.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  And I'm going to say, Hey, what's going on here?
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  What's going on here that we can't get this information?
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  Well, Bill, get me back on your local talk station too.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  Because I'm building a lot of good document.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  We'll, we'll, we'll run the gauntlet on this together.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  God bless you.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  I appreciate your call, folks.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  It's very simple.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  They openly announced world government two months ago for the Copenhagen meeting.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  You'll pay almost all your taxes to offshore banks in Austin, Texas.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  They're shutting down gun shows without laws.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  They want a $2.6 billion tax in the first three years starting next year.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  They're set to vote on it this month or next month to, to pay carbon taxes to the
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  UN and banks.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  This is criminal.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  This is happening in every major city.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  They don't want us getting together.
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  It's not just info wars.com and prisonplanet.com that are being shut down everywhere.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  It is everybody who's telling the truth.
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  And the White House says they want to start restricting talk radio.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  Nobody is safe.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  We have got to stand together against this un-American garbage now.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  As the founding fathers said, we don't hang together or all hang separate.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  Stay with us.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  Food is your only ammunition.
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  How much do you want?
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  When do you want it?
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:20.000]  Now or after the battle starts.
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  When will you need it?
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  Will there be any food?
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  How much will you need?
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  We don't know.
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  How much do you want?
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  All you can get.
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:44.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  It's very real.
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  I know because I use one every day in my own home and it's available right now to you.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Acola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system including reverse osmosis,
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  carbon filters and ultraviolet lights.
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling Acola Blue at 1-800-691-6043.

[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we talk a lot about solutions here and if Charonnie comes to your door, it will come in a uniform.
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  That's what Officer Jack McClellan and many others have called for for a long time.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  Stuart Rhodes, Army paratrooper, one of Ron Paul's chief staffers in Congress, is with us for the balance of the show
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  and we're going to go over the 10 orders they will not obey, but I want to ask the military and police something.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  Do you think America is about censorship? Do you think it's about websites being shut down?
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  Do you think it's about talk radio being restricted?
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  We have a corrupt government run by the same private banks worldwide that are doing unconstitutional things all over the place.
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  Stuart Rhodes, I mean you came in here today in the middle of a major typhoon of tyranny.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  The House passes the Cybersecurity Bill.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  The bill clearly restricts free speech, net IDs to get online, NSA running the internet, taking over all the infrastructure.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  What do you think about this major attack from China to Australia to Italy and to many ISPs in the U.S.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  banninginfowars.com and prisonplanet.com simultaneously as the U.N. calls for censorship, as the White House calls for it,
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  as Time Magazine calls for it, they all call for it this week and suddenly this happens.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  Well, they know that the strongest weapon we have is our free speech and the internet since the printing press is our most powerful weapon.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  They're trying to close it down. It's more important than the Second Amendment, too, frankly.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  Right to speech is more important than the bare arms.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  The pen is mightier than the sword.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  Oh, absolutely. So they're trying to shut it down. You bet.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  My whole issue is people better get hopping mad and upset about this or we're going to become like China.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  Right. You'll have no recourse but the arms to communicate and associate.
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  That's one of our core liberties freedom of association.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  What did Kennedy say? Those that make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  That's right. You have no other recourse.
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  I just can't believe this is happening globally to us right now.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  I mean, this is a global regime.
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  Look at this article right here.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  Read that headline out of the major newspaper of Australia.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  Secret summit of top bankers. Right.
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  And it says 24 top private and government bankers are meeting to set the course of the world secretly in Australia right now.
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  And in years past, you would even know about that.
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  You would only have the mainstream media, the four or five networks to tell you what's going on.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  You would even know it's taking place.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  The only reason you know it's taking place right now is because of the internet.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  All right. Let's shift gears to the other takeovers right now.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  Stuart Rhodes, expert trooper, disabled vet ex firearms instructor from Iran.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  Paul staff member Yale law grad research scholar and Montana about a lawyer.
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  Stuart has written for Gary Spencers, the warrior for more liberty.org.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  He writes the enemy at the gate column for SWAT magazine and is writing a book on the dangers of applying the laws of war to the American people in a war on terrorists.
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  And it goes on.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  Look, we have Obama setting up a puppet governorship of 10 governors.
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  They picked the my governor Nixon of Missouri, who said returning vets and gun owners and libertarians, the number one threat to the country.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  We know this is all really for us.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  That's why what a year ago or so you formed Oathkeepers now with chapters, 10s of thousands all over the country.
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  Stuart, what are we facing right now?
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  And why did you start Oathkeepers?
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  Well, I think we're facing the very very scary window. As you said before, it's a window of crisis intentionally created.
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  Their goal is to shut down and destroy our republic.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  But in this window, it's a two way window. We have we have an opportunity as well.
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  But the whole goal of Oathkeepers is to buy more time.
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  If I can get the military and police to consider and take their oath seriously, it causes strategic uncertainty in the minds of the elites.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  So they will hesitate and buy us more time to take the republic back from the ground up.
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  It can be done. We can do it. That's why they want to censor our free speech because they know that in the end, if we have free speech, we will win.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  They know that.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  That's why the Southern Poverty Law Center and others wrote these federal reports that we got leaked by good police last year who are demonizing us because they understand they're their brainwashing military and police.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  We're here telling them the truth.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  Exactly. They're building that wall bigger and bigger between the people and the police and the military.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  And we're trying to tear that wall down.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  And they want to label you as a hate-monger and me as a hate-monger because that's their tool to be able to censor you.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  If you can have you designated as a hate organization, then they can get the ISP providers to stop access to you.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  I've even had reports that in some military bases, I haven't confirmed it yet, but in some bases, they're having a hard time getting on to oathkeepers.org.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  So I'm not sure what's going on.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  No, no, I've seen confirmed reports of that, actually.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  Have you?
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  Yeah, I've been sent screenshots of you not being able to get to the site.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  And it's one thing to be blocked on bases and colleges. That's bad enough.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  And they're lying about us.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  But now government's just telling ISPs, period, for their customers.
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  And it's going to grow to everything.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  Right.
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  So, I mean, to me, this is the fight.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  We have to fight on First Amendment first.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  We have to be as adamant and as militant about defending our First Amendment rights as we would the Second Amendment.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  But we also should prepare for the very worst.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  I think you should be on Ham radio and we should all be on Ham radio.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  I'm on 100,000 watt, been on it for 14 years.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  Right.
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  WWCR.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  We're live right now, six hours a day or actually eight hours a day now on WWCR.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  But again, the main fights on the web.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  Oh, sure.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  I can post any video on YouTube and get 100,000 views easy.
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  I mean, my films have had more than 150 million views conservatively.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  That's hurting them, Stuart.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  Oh, certainly.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  But we should prepare for the worst, I'm saying.
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  No, no, I agree with you.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  In fact, I've already had a secret plan for a year while we have the new office that we're building next door to go to a file we send people who then print up a local newspaper.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  We're not going to be stopped.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  Right.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  Just in case.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  Go back to the old handbills on the street corner if you have to.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  We're going 1776.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  Exactly.
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  That's the answer, right?
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  Yeah.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  We already knew this, Stuart.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  I mean, we already knew this, but it.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  Do you agree with me that the fact that the UN openly is calling for web censorship, Microsoft, the White House, Google, that that they're doing it now is because they're going into a new, more dangerous phase?
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  Well, sure.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  The mask is slipping and they're getting ready.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  That's why the Cyberterrorism Act talks about a state of emergency.
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  So say you have an economic collapse.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  We're saying it's done intentionally. Now you can you can shut down the Internet, shut down all communications.
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  And once again, you'll get only what's on.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  You'll probably have like a America radio or something.
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  What's all you're going to hear?
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  No, actually, the White House said that we may shut down the web to save it.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  And they said, oh, during the flu, we may make all sites direct to the UN.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  Who?
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  I mean, they're saying it.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  Right, right.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  And then Cass Sunstein tells the truth of the White House and says, no, these people are exposing us.
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  We've got to shut them down and arrest them.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  Did you read those papers he wrote?
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  No, I did not.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  I mean, I mean, people want to read it.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  I mean, these people are out.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  They're obviously the tyrants.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  So what do we do?
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  I think we need to organize locally.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  I think we need to make sure we have strong communities, get to know your neighbors, get to know all your police in your area and all the veterans and start developing those networks down at the very bottom of our society and get ready for whatever comes.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  Clearly, you've been invited to them, but the Tea Party has been co-opted by the RNC.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  Well, there's a struggle inside the Tea Party right now.
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  There's two sides to it.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  The Grassroot Tea Parties, they are still there.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  Gillespie County Patriots is an example of that.
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  Just had Sheriff Mack and I speak last night.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  But there is this new entity.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  What's it called?
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  The Tea Party Nation.
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  Yeah.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  And so that's, that's obviously.
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  Which is Fox Nation.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  Right.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  Right.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  To attempt to co-opt the Tea Party movement.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  And they're like more wars, police state, Patriot Act, good.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  Yeah.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  And notice Bush and Obama continue the same policies.
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  Right.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  And Sir Palin's speech, I watched it last night.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  It was all standard neocon, old GOP insider hack language.
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  I'm going to be covering it this week.
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  We're in deep trouble.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  We are.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  Definitely.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  Well, let's talk about the solution.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  The police and military are not bad people.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  They're brainwashes like the general public.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  If we can reach out to them through the Oathkeepers and other groups, we can short circuit this
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  entire behemoth.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  Stuart Rhodes is our guest, we'll give you the website, how you get informed, how you
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  read the pledge, the ten orders they will not follow.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  There's a lot of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan wearing the patches.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  It's got the system scared.
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  We'll be right back in defense of the Republic.
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  at home.
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  And have turned an innocent influence on our president in Congress.
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  And they really are calling the shots.
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:28.000]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  The criminal offshore cartel hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  world government.
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:37.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  They're asking for more matches.
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:41.000]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:44.000]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:49.000]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:54.000]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.

[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:09.000]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:14.000]  Every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:26.000]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:31:26.000 --> 1:31:30.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:31.000]  and be immunized?
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:39.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:40.000]  How much will you need?
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:41.000]  We don't know.
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  How much do you want?
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:43.000]  All you can get.
[1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  I'm Alex Jones.

[1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:11.000]  Here we go.
[1:33:11.000 --> 1:33:18.000]  Let's go over.
[1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:22.000]  Stuart Rhodes, founder of Oathkeepers a year ago, exploding all over the country in the
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:23.000]  world, is our guest.
[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  Tell us briefly about Oathkeepers.
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  Go over the 10 orders you will not follow.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  This will hamstring the Achilles' heel of the New World Order.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  Then let's get into your home safe program.
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is real.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  Foreign offshore banks have seized the United States.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  We're being censored, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  They don't want you to see fall of the Republic.
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  The Obama deception.
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  I mean, I sell the DVDs in my films, but it's free and high quality on YouTube.
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  Take advantage of these $200,000 films.
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  It took me $200,000 to make this.
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  It's free to you.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  I'm for real.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  We have a vision of defending the Republic.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  I want to add, Jason Burmes is coming up for three hours after us.
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  Stuart Rhodes is going to be with him for the whole first hour or so, the infowars.com
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  streams, your local M&FM.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  While you can still get it.
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  Stuart, I want to get into Oathkeepers, but people better use the Internet while they've got it.
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  Absolutely.
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  Use it or lose it.
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  That's right.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  Use it or lose it.
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  Okay.
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  Get into Oathkeepers.
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  Well, the whole point of Oathkeepers is the founders were smart enough to make the oath
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  to the Constitution not to any man or office.
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  And so we are reminding all the police and military that they took a Constitution-required
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  oath to support and defend that document against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  It's a very powerful weapon on our side.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  So the focus is there.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  Remind them of the oath and teach them more about the Constitution.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  They've been intentionally dumbed down and kept ignorant through public schooling and
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  also lack of education on the Constitution in the military.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  They're not taught about the Bill of Rights in the military.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  So we're going to make sure they know what they're doing.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  The good news is though, when I say that the military is on fire with Oathkeepers and the
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  three percenters, they are.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  They are.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  Absolutely.
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  They understand that something's wrong.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  Many of them are very traditional Americans and very sincere patriots.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  And so we know they have the courage, but courage without knowledge will not be sufficient.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  In fact, it'll be used by evil.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  That's right.
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  Courage.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  That's right.
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  It can be twisted in thinking that you're being patriotic by defending the people against
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  these evil extremist haters.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  And so that's the tactic of our enemies.
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  But our tactic is to remind them of the basic knowledge that we're trying to impart about
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  our Bill of Rights, about the Declaration of Independence, about the core principles of
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  natural rights.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  Because it's a hedge.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  When you don't have that, you're just like North Korea or Mexico.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  Mexico has tripled the resources we do.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  They're in squalor and tyranny because they have a corrupt system.
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  Well, sure.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  That mean the whole point of America is liberty.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  The Declaration of Independence makes very clear the whole point of the government is
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  to secure your natural rights.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  Meanwhile, FEMA's running around demonizing the founding fathers.
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  Stewart, go over the ten orders you will not follow.
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  Well, the ten orders are not the oath.
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  A lot of folks are kind of mistaken about that.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  The oath is to the Constitution that we all swore in our public service.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  But this declaration, the whole point of this is to get them thinking about the very clear
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  lines in the sand, the most dangerous stuff.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  It's not everything to be unconstitutional.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  I get emails from guys saying, what about Posse Commentators?
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  You don't mention that.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  Well, this is only a start.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  But these are the most dangerous ones.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  Number one, we will not obey any order to disarm the American people.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  Because that is what led to fighting in the first American Revolution.
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  1775.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  You betcha.
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  After all the abuse that they had suffered of all their other natural rights, it was
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  the attempt to disarm them that finally got to the point where they had to fight back.
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  Number two is we will not obey orders to conduct warrantless searches of the American people,
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  their homes, vehicles, papers or effects, such as warrantless house to house searches
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  for weapons or persons.
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  And that happened during Katrina.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  The first thing they went for was the guns in the high and dry areas.
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  That's right.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  So people say, oh, you're paranoid.
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  It doesn't ever happen in America.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  They're having knock and talk everywhere.
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  They're shutting down gun shows without laws.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  That's a very pure in Austin.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  That's right.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  That was a terrible example of arbitrary capricious fiat law.
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  No law at all.
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  Just ruled by by authority saying, I'm going to do this, right?
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  No law passed by Congress.
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  The ATF just came in and said, you cannot have private sales inside of the gun show.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  Yep.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  So number three is we will not obey any orders to detain American citizens as unlawful enemy
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  combatants or subject them to trial by military tribunal.
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  And this claim powers, to me, the most dangerous is the claim that the president's commander
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  in chief can apply the laws of war to you and I, American citizens.
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  And notice they're now saying, oh, we'll kill US citizens.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  Right.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  We'll target US citizens.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  And what is the difference between targeting US citizen in the Sudan and one here?
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  Where is the constitutional separation between those two things?
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  It's not there.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  If they can do it over there, they'll do it here too.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  Padillo is arrested in Chicago O'Hara International Airport.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  It doesn't make a difference where you are.
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  And we don't give up our bill of rights because of some fake boogeyman.
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  It's come out.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  The underwear bomber was protected by the government.
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  That's mainstream news.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  Go ahead.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  Well, the basic point is whether or not an American citizen is actually making war against
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  his own country.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  The remedy is an article.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  They get due process because they throw out the entire due process if we don't.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  Absolutely.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  If you're so afraid of Islamic terrorists that you want to tear apart the bill of rights
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  and throw it away, you'll wind up in Nazi Germany, which we are now doing.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  Go ahead.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  That's exactly right.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:31.500]  They will not obey orders to impose martial law or a state of emergency on any state or
[1:38:31.500 --> 1:38:36.000]  to enter with force into a state without the express consent and invitation of the state's
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  legislature.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  And you have to do that because the John Warren Defense Authorization Act says even if the
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:41.680]  governors say no, we're going to do it.
[1:38:41.680 --> 1:38:46.000]  And now he's created a puppet 10-member governorship to claim he has power over the states.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  And they admit they are taking over the states.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  And the secret Homeland Security documents admit it's actually for a takeover of America.
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  I mean, we have the documents.
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  This is for the American people, not for guys in turbines.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  Also, the whole point of that council governor is a circumvent, the requirement of the authorization
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  of the state legislature.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  Article 4 section 4 of the Constitution says that only upon the application of the state
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  legislature, or if they can't be convened, the executive, can the feds come in even to
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  stop an insurrection against the state.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  They say there's an insurrection against the government of Texas.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  And the feds want to come in to stop that.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  They can't do anything without the invitation of your legislature or your governor.
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  Because the state's created the federal government.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  That's exactly right.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  So number five is we will not obey orders to invade and subjugate any state that asserts
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  its sovereignty and declares the national government to be in violation of the compact
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  by which that state entered the union.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  We are a dual sovereignty system.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  States have the power and responsibility to intercede and guard that.
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  And now a whole bunch of attorney generals and states are moving to block unconstitutional
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  gun laws, government health care, everything, and the feds are moving in.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  Continue.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  Right.
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  They're inserting their sovereignty.
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  It's a tool.
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  Two systems.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  If the states were to interfere with the sovereign sphere of the national government, they will
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  defend that.
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  Everything is a separation of powers.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  That's right.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  We will not obey orders to blockade American cities.
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  Thus turning them in the giant attention camps.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  And that's in all these executive orders, this biological attack order.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  Well, it's also was done during Katrina.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  People were not allowed to leave out of New Orleans across the bridge.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  It's in our film, it's on our website at oathcures.org.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  You can go there and watch that video.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  We have clips there of a shepherd Smith from Fox News standing on the bridge saying they
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  will not let them cross this bridge to get out of there.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  Continue.
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  We will not obey any order to enforce American, to force American citizens into any form of
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  detention camps under any pretext.
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  And that was done already in our history to the Japanese Americans.
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  And the Italians.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  And we now have the National Emergency Centers Act that admits they built the camps.
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  That's exactly right.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  They're putting together a lot of stuff as dual use to put together a detention center
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  or an emergency center.
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  Supposedly for refugees from other countries, etc.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  But they always have dual use.
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  But well, back in 99 with that, that staged event in the Seattle, the WTO, they put them
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:09.000]  in the Sandpoint Naval FEMA Brig.
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  And also happened in New York City too.
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  Yeah, here 57.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  We will not obey orders to assist or support the use of any foreign troops on US soil against
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  the American people to keep the peace or to maintain control.
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  And we know the Army War Colleges teaching they'll use foreign troops in LE09 last year.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:29.000]  FEMA with 14 nations trained to quote, take on American terrorists.
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  Well, you also had, you also had a weird thing where you had foreign troops training with
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  their National Guard across the country.
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  You had Uzbekistani troops up in Montana of all places.
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  And once again, it's an example of dual use.
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  They say they're there for only training them to go back home and do that.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  But then they admit it's for domestic use.
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  Go ahead.
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  Right.
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  We will not obey orders too.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  So there, we will consider such use of foreign troops against our people to be an invasion
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  and act of war.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  Number nine, we will not obey any order to confiscate the property of the American people,
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  including food and other essential supplies under any emergency pretext.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  And that's in executive orders.
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  To take the food.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  And it's also been used historically as a weapon of war as well.
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  No easier way to subjugate a people than to cause a famine or to confiscate what was
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  done to the Kulaks, right?
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  But by Stalin.
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  So number 10 is we will not obey any order, which infringes on the right of the people
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  to free speech, to peaceably assemble, or to petition their government for re-disagreavances.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  And we have the free speech zones.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  We have the provocateurs.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  They hire to go to events.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  We have the clear program going on of restriction.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  Let's talk about the new programs that oathkeepers aren't launching.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  I want to tell the listeners again, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, suddenly you're being censored
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  all over the world.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  This is confirmed.
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  Big reports coming up live tomorrow.
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  Final segment with Stuart Rhodes, straight ahead.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  While you can still visit them, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, fall the republic, the film
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  online, get it today.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  We'll see you tomorrow.
