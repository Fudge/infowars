[00:00.000 --> 00:07.600]  Alex Jones, you're reporting from Hawaii, we're off the island of Maui, and Democrat
[00:07.600 --> 00:11.800]  Congressman Hank Johnson believes that islands flow, we're about to see if his theory is
[00:11.800 --> 00:12.800]  correct.
[00:12.800 --> 00:16.120]  He also believes socialism works by other capitalism, which is similar to believing
[00:16.120 --> 00:17.120]  that islands flow.
[00:17.120 --> 00:20.560]  But let's see if he's correct, because after all, if you don't agree with him, you're
[00:20.560 --> 00:21.560]  racist.
[00:21.560 --> 00:33.800]  They are islands that, at its widest level, is 12 miles from shore to shore.
[00:33.800 --> 00:44.320]  My fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over
[00:44.320 --> 00:49.520]  and capsize.
[00:49.520 --> 00:56.520]  We don't anticipate that.
[00:56.520 --> 01:04.360]  Look, it's total proof, the island is the top of a mountain, and it just keeps going
[01:04.360 --> 01:08.560]  down 20,000 feet off the coast of Hawaii, the size is to the right, but Democrat Hank
[01:08.560 --> 01:13.560]  Johnson is wrong, total proof, look.
[01:13.560 --> 01:23.160]  Now, those are boats, those don't float, the pride of Maui is aluminum, and it floats
[01:23.160 --> 01:26.280]  on top of water, rocks do not float on top of water.
[01:26.280 --> 01:31.040]  I would sign off as Alex Jones with infowars.com, but now I identify as Hank Johnson, a black
[01:31.040 --> 01:32.040]  man from Atlanta.
[01:32.040 --> 01:48.240]  So, Hank Johnson for infowars.com, signing off, over and out.
[01:48.240 --> 01:57.320]  What happens when you put in a cage fight a giant in with a midget?
[01:57.320 --> 02:03.200]  Hey, Mr. Johnson, I've got a quick question for you.
[02:03.200 --> 02:04.200]  Have you ever, oh yeah.
[02:04.200 --> 02:05.200]  Roger Stone did nothing wrong.
[02:05.200 --> 02:06.200]  Hey, Alex Jones, the little people, and Guam.
[02:06.200 --> 02:07.200]  I've always wanted to ask you, that was a joke when you said Guam floated.
[02:07.200 --> 02:08.200]  Right, it was.
[02:08.200 --> 02:19.200]  This is an island that, at its widest level, is what, 12 miles from shore to shore.
[02:19.200 --> 02:38.600]  Yeah, my fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip
[02:38.600 --> 02:44.520]  over and capsize.
[02:44.520 --> 02:45.520]  We don't anticipate that.
[02:45.520 --> 02:46.520]  That's what I thought.
[02:46.520 --> 02:49.520]  You're a man with a sense of humor.
[02:49.520 --> 02:50.520]  That's right.
[02:50.520 --> 02:51.520]  I always knew that.
[02:51.520 --> 02:54.520]  Well, I always, when I'm watching C-SPAN, I see you talking, it's funny, but you say
[02:54.520 --> 02:57.520]  some really weird stuff, and some of you say some really ridiculous stuff, and I think
[02:57.520 --> 03:00.760]  people are maybe, like, doing something to me, taking stuff out of context.
[03:00.760 --> 03:05.680]  The midget will not win the fight, I'm going to tell you that.
[03:05.680 --> 03:06.680]  Why?
[03:06.680 --> 03:11.520]  It just doesn't carry enough weight as I'm prone to do.
[03:11.520 --> 03:13.640]  I use a lot of analogies.
[03:13.640 --> 03:20.920]  And so last night, I used an analogy that some find offensive.
[03:20.920 --> 03:28.120]  Just within the last 12 hours or so, I have found that the use of the midget, excuse me,
[03:28.120 --> 03:34.960]  the use of the M word is no longer socially acceptable.
[03:34.960 --> 03:45.800]  Even the Washington Post admits, Google location, when you turn it off, they still track it.
[03:45.800 --> 03:50.280]  So, you know, Sundar's a nice, they like him a fella, but it's not telling the truth.
[03:50.280 --> 03:56.240]  Well, I think we have to get more, we've got to get more precise with our questions.
[03:56.240 --> 03:57.240]  We got to get it tight, get it right?
[03:57.240 --> 04:02.240]  Perhaps if she had more than five minutes, we could enjoy that.
[04:02.240 --> 04:03.240]  I agree.
[04:03.240 --> 04:08.080]  How about Google helping censor the Chinese with their dragonfly operation?
[04:08.080 --> 04:14.600]  I think that when you are in a foreign country doing business, you can do business in accordance
[04:14.600 --> 04:17.280]  with that country's policies.
[04:17.280 --> 04:22.600]  And so it's a difficult situation in this global environment and whatnot.
[04:22.600 --> 04:26.960]  These folks, two million mussels to put in concentration camps, I don't know about all
[04:26.960 --> 04:27.960]  of them.
[04:27.960 --> 04:34.960]  So, this is kind of an unwielded situation, it's good to meet you, good to let it to you.
[04:34.960 --> 04:35.960]  Where is Kerber?
[04:35.960 --> 05:00.960]  I'll see you on the wall.
[05:00.960 --> 05:07.960]  Thanks for watching this video.
[05:07.960 --> 05:13.120]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially
[05:13.120 --> 05:19.760]  formulated prebiotic fiber, a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia fruit and flax
[05:19.760 --> 05:21.400]  fiber.
[05:21.400 --> 05:26.560]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which
[05:26.560 --> 05:32.200]  helps you digest food, absorb nutrients and even support your immune system.
[05:32.200 --> 05:37.040]  InfoWarsLife's cutting edge formula only brings you the highest quality, organic and
[05:37.040 --> 05:39.560]  clinically studied ingredients.
[05:39.560 --> 05:44.480]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium
[05:44.480 --> 05:51.360]  organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon
[05:51.360 --> 05:54.080]  for maximum prebiotic effect.

[06:01.080 --> 06:27.040]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, U.S. resistance against
[06:27.040 --> 06:31.480]  a global corporate combine empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big mega
[06:31.480 --> 06:34.760]  banks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[06:34.760 --> 06:39.040]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.
[06:39.040 --> 06:41.200]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[06:41.200 --> 06:43.600]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[06:43.600 --> 06:44.600]  This is all confirmed.
[06:44.600 --> 06:45.840]  This is not a drill.
[06:45.840 --> 06:49.680]  Big Tech and Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[06:49.680 --> 06:51.680]  They've officially become state-run.
[06:51.680 --> 06:52.680]  Apple 100%.
[06:52.680 --> 06:57.960]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger in total worldwide censorship.
[06:57.960 --> 07:02.760]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones
[07:02.760 --> 07:03.760]  to do that.
[07:03.760 --> 07:04.760]  This is happening.
[07:04.760 --> 07:08.960]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship,
[07:08.960 --> 07:12.480]  thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[07:12.480 --> 07:17.440]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all
[07:17.440 --> 07:18.440]  previous attacks.
[07:18.440 --> 07:24.680]  This is a tight-traded dose, reverse psychological warfare operation, using adapt and overcome,
[07:24.680 --> 07:26.680]  subversion, paradigm manipulation.
[07:26.680 --> 07:31.520]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[07:31.520 --> 07:35.040]  We adapt to being oppressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[07:35.040 --> 07:40.880]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion
[07:40.880 --> 07:45.560]  instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[07:45.560 --> 07:55.800]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States with traders
[07:55.800 --> 08:00.600]  inside the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting
[08:00.600 --> 08:05.520]  to stop us from removing the tentacles of the chai-con-slash-big-tech-making-combine emergency
[08:05.520 --> 08:06.520]  situation.
[08:06.520 --> 08:09.920]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been
[08:09.920 --> 08:12.800]  battering, ramming and out as much as I can.
[08:12.800 --> 08:17.960]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception
[08:17.960 --> 08:21.560]  where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[08:21.560 --> 08:26.040]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw
[08:26.040 --> 08:27.040]  man.
[08:27.040 --> 08:30.520]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars, and so they make
[08:30.520 --> 08:31.520]  me a herder of children.
[08:31.520 --> 08:36.080]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually
[08:36.080 --> 08:41.400]  censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones, so even if I didn't sell out
[08:41.400 --> 08:47.240]  to them, they'd now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[08:47.240 --> 08:51.880]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being
[08:51.880 --> 08:52.880]  used against you.
[08:52.880 --> 08:57.880]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[08:57.880 --> 09:04.400]  I have given you the transmission, now break free!
[09:04.400 --> 09:11.720]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[09:11.720 --> 09:14.040]  the mind of man.
[09:14.040 --> 09:28.080]  Thomas Jefferson, if you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[09:28.080 --> 09:31.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, December 14, 2018.
[09:31.400 --> 09:34.680]  I'm your host Alex Jones, we're going to be here for the next four hours, and of course
[09:34.680 --> 09:38.400]  you've got the war room with Owen Schroyer, Rogers Chud and others, kicks off every day
[09:38.400 --> 09:39.400]  at 3 p.m. Central.
[09:39.400 --> 09:43.560]  We come right back in the morning with info wars live transmission with day-to-night,
[09:43.560 --> 09:49.360]  weekdays, weekday mornings, 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. right before this broadcast.
[09:49.360 --> 09:55.320]  I talked about basically the same subject at the start of the broadcast yesterday, radio
[09:55.320 --> 10:01.400]  slash TV, syndicated transmission, that I look at the news and I read the news and then
[10:01.400 --> 10:05.200]  I see what's happening on the street in my own life and what's happening in the schools
[10:05.200 --> 10:11.400]  and the churches and the grocery stores and the farms and factories and I get very, very
[10:11.400 --> 10:19.040]  angry and that it's hard for me to then really go on air.
[10:19.040 --> 10:23.800]  So that's why I have to explain to folks why I either have to be very cynical about things
[10:23.800 --> 10:29.760]  on air or I'm going to start screaming and yelling or maybe even crying because when
[10:29.760 --> 10:41.160]  you really do care and you see a bunch of other people that don't, you get angry and
[10:41.160 --> 10:54.960]  you witness how the establishment, these creatures play on our weakest issues, play on our lesser
[10:54.960 --> 11:01.760]  angels and how they divide and conquer us and how they poison us and how they give us
[11:01.760 --> 11:06.760]  disinformation from birth and how they target the children.
[11:06.760 --> 11:07.760]  It enrages me.
[11:07.760 --> 11:11.360]  You know, I don't just read the newspapers, I have my own personal experiences just like
[11:11.360 --> 11:22.720]  you do and every year at the start of school, I see on the streets of America and I hear
[11:22.720 --> 11:25.120]  about it from friends, family and neighbors.
[11:25.120 --> 11:30.200]  I hear about it from my own children, I have four children, about young people that go
[11:30.200 --> 11:33.760]  get their vaccine and have a convulsion and are in the hospital.
[11:33.760 --> 11:41.040]  I also have a lot of friends, a lot of friends who's two, three, four-year-olds come down
[11:41.040 --> 11:45.920]  with quote, type one diabetes and they say, well, it's not from their diet, it must be
[11:45.920 --> 11:46.920]  genetic.
[11:46.920 --> 11:52.720]  Well, yeah, it's genetic that they got permanent pancreatitis and the insert says it can shut
[11:52.720 --> 12:03.000]  down the flu shot, says it can shut down your pancreas forever and then school's out forever
[12:03.000 --> 12:09.160]  because your pancreas has been blown to pieces.
[12:09.160 --> 12:12.720]  And just like I opened the show up yesterday with all the thousands of deaths and people
[12:12.720 --> 12:20.000]  paralyzed by polio-like disease, but they won't say it's polio and oh, they can't treat it
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.200]  and they don't want to talk about it and they tell you that, well, we're not going to report
[12:25.200 --> 12:26.200]  it.
[12:26.200 --> 12:30.240]  The CDC has said to hospitals, don't report this publicly, do it in our secret reporting
[12:30.240 --> 12:34.960]  system that they use for the secret experimentation and the secret taking of blood at birth for
[12:34.960 --> 12:42.400]  46 years under secret law, which we first exposed 20 years ago, that were then lawsuits
[12:42.400 --> 12:47.280]  in Texas and Minnesota, all confirmed, and the national secret worldwide database was
[12:47.280 --> 12:49.960]  then discovered run by the United Nations.
[12:49.960 --> 12:52.960]  But I digress.
[12:52.960 --> 12:58.360]  I have all this incredible news, but look what I saw in my stacks and I saw several others
[12:58.360 --> 12:59.360]  in the stacks.
[12:59.360 --> 13:01.880]  They're not even looking for vaccine damage news.
[13:01.880 --> 13:02.880]  It's there.
[13:02.880 --> 13:03.880]  They can't hide it.
[13:03.880 --> 13:09.200]  Lou Ferrigno, he almost died.
[13:09.200 --> 13:16.000]  And even the New York Post, even People Magazine says the incredible Hulk Lou Ferrigno hospitalized
[13:16.000 --> 13:21.760]  that for pneumonia vaccination goes wrong.
[13:21.760 --> 13:25.680]  But every year when they get ready to shoot your kids up before school starts, what do
[13:25.680 --> 13:29.280]  they say on the news?
[13:29.280 --> 13:34.240]  They say safe and effective might make the injection site sore.
[13:34.240 --> 13:38.280]  It's a conspiracy theory by the guy that says Sandy Hook didn't happen.
[13:38.280 --> 13:40.080]  They always throw that in there.
[13:40.080 --> 13:45.280]  A lot of articles, but in fact, hundreds every year at the start of school say Alex Jones
[13:45.280 --> 13:48.080]  says this, and well, he's a racist.
[13:48.080 --> 13:55.080]  Meanwhile, my grandmother got polio, my uncle almost died from a tetanus shot.
[13:55.080 --> 14:03.400]  I literally know multiple people in this building where the vaccines killed their children,
[14:03.400 --> 14:07.560]  killed them as in dead.
[14:07.560 --> 14:10.800]  And still people won't listen to me.
[14:10.800 --> 14:14.360]  Lou Ferrigno will tell you more about this, but I'm not going to get to it this hour.
[14:14.360 --> 14:18.840]  So you get into geopolitical stuff and economic things and the UN worldwide funding Marxist
[14:18.840 --> 14:20.160]  style race war.
[14:20.160 --> 14:21.160]  That's all coming up first.
[14:21.160 --> 14:25.240]  I'm going to set all the vaccine deaths and illnesses and people paralyzed.
[14:25.240 --> 14:27.240]  I'm going to set this aside.
[14:27.240 --> 14:30.720]  Yeah, you take the pneumonia shot, you get pneumonia.
[14:30.720 --> 14:32.840]  You take the flu shot, you get flu.
[14:32.840 --> 14:35.000]  Everybody knows this.
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.240]  My mother was not in was not in professional sports when she was younger, didn't start
[14:40.240 --> 14:41.240]  competitively swimming.
[14:41.240 --> 14:46.240]  But she was 35 and then she was on the UT Masters won silver medals, gold medals at
[14:46.240 --> 14:47.240]  national competitions.
[14:47.240 --> 14:52.200]  I mean, she was, she was beating former, former Olympic athletes and UT told her at
[14:52.200 --> 14:56.520]  about 43 told them all, take your flu shot.
[14:56.520 --> 15:01.160]  We've got some big meats coming up and she took it and almost killed my mama.
[15:01.160 --> 15:03.760]  She was in bed for a month.
[15:03.760 --> 15:08.760]  She lost 25 pounds and she never came back to where she was ever again.
[15:08.760 --> 15:14.280]  I warn you again, folks, you can't swing a stick in the dark and not hit somebody that
[15:14.280 --> 15:17.520]  got killed or almost killed by this crap.
[15:17.520 --> 15:23.080]  So I'm pissed and I say it's time to stop playing damn games.
[15:23.080 --> 15:24.080]  Excuse me.
[15:24.080 --> 15:29.880]  I see I'm having real anger issues right now and it's not an act and I apologize for using
[15:29.880 --> 15:30.880]  the Lord's name in vain.
[15:30.880 --> 15:33.880]  I don't intend it is that I really, your preacher saying God says you'll be damned
[15:33.880 --> 15:34.880]  to hell.
[15:34.880 --> 15:40.520]  All I'm saying is God, please damn these people to hell that know what they're doing.
[15:40.520 --> 15:42.600]  Please support us because the global's trying to shut us down.
[15:42.600 --> 15:47.800]  You know that biggest sales ever, store-wide free shipping, 50, 75% off and a free t-shirt

[19:28.600 --> 19:33.600]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[19:33.600 --> 19:40.840]  and drive to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.

[20:22.160 --> 20:49.600]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've got the rat coming clean, Mr. Cohen, one of Trump's
[20:49.600 --> 20:57.520]  disgraced lawyers, giving his so-called interview to 60 Minutes, that's going to be coming
[20:57.520 --> 20:58.520]  up.
[20:58.520 --> 21:06.080]  We're also going to get to obviously the massive news of the UN trying to stir up race war
[21:06.080 --> 21:07.080]  all over the planet.
[21:07.080 --> 21:12.360]  They've got major leaders in South Africa, top politicians, the heads of major parties
[21:12.360 --> 21:17.500]  saying we will kill their children and women, fury over black South African politicians
[21:17.500 --> 21:22.680]  called to kill whites, we're going to pull up Khalid Muhammad, he's still on YouTube,
[21:22.680 --> 21:28.760]  we kill the women, we kill the children, we kill the babies, you say why do you kill those
[21:28.760 --> 21:31.920]  little beautiful blonde-haired blue-eyed babies?
[21:31.920 --> 21:37.080]  Because every nine months the white woman lays down on her back and military enforcements
[21:37.080 --> 21:38.640]  roll out.
[21:38.640 --> 21:44.600]  So I say kill them all.
[21:44.600 --> 21:47.600]  That's what's taught by the communists in the United States and that's what's taught
[21:47.600 --> 21:55.680]  by the communists in South Africa and it ties in to even mainstream politico all these
[21:55.680 --> 21:56.680]  years later.
[21:56.680 --> 22:03.280]  Hell, Paul Watson went to several European countries a few years ago and he offered
[22:03.280 --> 22:08.000]  a huge bounty, a large amount of money to any mainstream media that would go to these
[22:08.000 --> 22:11.400]  no-go zones and then when they went there they found out that indeed people tried to
[22:11.400 --> 22:12.400]  kill them.
[22:12.400 --> 22:18.120]  The no-go zones are most areas of cities, I mean it's just hellish.
[22:18.120 --> 22:28.080]  And here's politico, Sweden's violent reality is undoing a peaceful self-image, but you
[22:28.080 --> 22:38.120]  read it and it's nothing about it being Muslims, 90% of the crime, hilarious, wow, unbelievable.
[22:38.120 --> 22:43.680]  So we'll be looking into all that and this is really the biggest news of the day.
[22:43.680 --> 22:48.000]  So I want to spend some time on it coming up.
[22:48.000 --> 22:53.840]  French generals accused Macron and these are acting generals, major generals and others
[22:53.840 --> 23:02.240]  of treason over UN migration pact and they go on to say that's what it is, wow.
[23:02.240 --> 23:05.520]  No one would talk about the UN migration pact two years ago when we were talking about it
[23:05.520 --> 23:09.440]  or six months ago or a month ago, now it's all over the news and the French military
[23:09.440 --> 23:16.680]  saying we may have to remove you and the public has a right to revolt.
[23:16.680 --> 23:26.720]  Wait till we get to that and oh, the Egyptian president has come out and said that the left
[23:26.720 --> 23:34.200]  is organizing Islam into an invasion force to take down Europe and that Muslims should
[23:34.200 --> 23:42.920]  openly assimilate and decry the leftist alliance with radical forms of Islam like Wahhabism
[23:42.920 --> 23:47.920]  or that it's going to basically trigger a class of civilizations and he's a good guy.
[23:47.920 --> 23:53.680]  He's pro-Trump, pro-America, Egyptian president blast migrants on assimilating in Europe and
[23:53.680 --> 24:00.560]  says they have built superior technology and superior culture and that we need to adopt
[24:00.560 --> 24:01.560]  it.
[24:01.560 --> 24:07.880]  Now that's just being honest, just like in Egypt 5,000 years ago people were trying to
[24:07.880 --> 24:11.840]  get in there because that's superior technology, you need to adopt the Egyptian culture and
[24:11.840 --> 24:16.600]  so he's telling people, listen, you don't want to ally yourself with the globalists
[24:16.600 --> 24:19.800]  on the left, you're crazy.
[24:19.800 --> 24:27.320]  So see from Russia to Poland to the United States to England to Brazil to everywhere,
[24:27.320 --> 24:32.280]  people are getting it, big megacorporations are allied with China and the communist, radical
[24:32.280 --> 24:40.120]  Islam, God-hating leftist and everybody's going, whoa, we don't want to be part of this,
[24:40.120 --> 24:44.600]  we don't want to blow up America and Europe, we're not enemies with you, we don't want
[24:44.600 --> 24:48.160]  to be played in this game.
[24:48.160 --> 24:52.520]  So suddenly everything we've talked about in our basic nomenclature, you see, is the
[24:52.520 --> 25:01.880]  speech of the world now, our terms like world government, global governance, new world order,
[25:01.880 --> 25:09.800]  tax exempt foundations, diplomatic immunity for the UN, carbon taxes, Agenda 21, Agenda
[25:09.800 --> 25:16.880]  2030, weaponized third world populations, now it's on because we've forced the terms
[25:16.880 --> 25:23.400]  into common use and we've exposed how the world really works after them stonewalling
[25:23.400 --> 25:28.760]  for decades while they built this monster and now we've got a good chance of beating
[25:28.760 --> 25:33.240]  these people but we had to admit there was a global criminal government forming, we had
[25:33.240 --> 25:36.600]  to admit it was allied with radical Islam, we had to admit they're targeting our children
[25:36.600 --> 25:40.680]  and our families, it was hard to admit when they were first building it because who wants
[25:40.680 --> 25:45.720]  to admit this, it's crazy but now that it's emerging and now that we're really facing
[25:45.720 --> 25:52.800]  it, we now know who the enemy is and we're going to win.
[25:52.800 --> 25:59.760]  In fact, look at Rogerport.com.
[25:59.760 --> 26:03.920]  Paris police braced for more violent protests, now the government admits you are nationalist,
[26:03.920 --> 26:07.480]  you are French, we've brought in 10 million illegal aliens, they're crapping all over
[26:07.480 --> 26:13.440]  the ground, everything's going bankrupt, we shouldn't have 85% taxes and the EU says
[26:13.440 --> 26:18.720]  that they're about to fall and that the global order is collapsing, even the global order
[26:18.720 --> 26:25.760]  of breaking the social compact and overrunning our countries and enslaving us, yes, that
[26:25.760 --> 26:31.440]  order is in trouble because humanity is now awakening and the process is accelerating
[26:31.440 --> 26:35.240]  and there's only a few ways the globalist could stop this now but I'm going to break
[26:35.240 --> 26:39.360]  those down on the other side.
[26:39.360 --> 26:43.000]  First year's news today, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have our reporters there again
[26:43.000 --> 26:47.720]  this weekend on the ground, Dan Lyman got shot at, men and women have their eyes blown
[26:47.720 --> 26:54.920]  out by the French, got to stop myself, most of them weren't French, the big blue armored
[26:54.920 --> 27:00.400]  vehicles with the UN-controlled EU symbol on it with mercenaries for the first time
[27:00.400 --> 27:06.640]  since 1945, foreign troops, oh and what are these general sites as treason and the need
[27:06.640 --> 27:14.240]  to remove the entire traitorous government, they cite the armored EU vehicles, see how
[27:14.240 --> 27:20.120]  they hid that in plain view, foreign mercs, many of them, on your streets suppressing
[27:20.120 --> 27:28.960]  you, foreign troops, what did I say, on Sunday and Monday, foreign troops treason, France
[27:28.960 --> 27:33.040]  invaded for the first time since World War II by a foreign power, Macron liked the Vichy
[27:33.040 --> 27:38.040]  French and now in the letters written by the top generals they say exactly that, they
[27:38.040 --> 27:43.720]  didn't get that from me, they know history, they're seeing it happen, you're seeing
[27:43.720 --> 27:49.440]  France being conquered but not without a shot being fired, the mercs are there targeting
[27:49.440 --> 27:54.320]  men and women shooting them in the face with rubber bullets, I predict that will cause
[27:54.320 --> 28:01.000]  the violent overthrow of the French government by the military and I salute it because it's
[28:01.000 --> 28:06.760]  not the French government, it's an occupied criminal collaborator group of dirtbags that
[28:06.760 --> 28:11.520]  need to be removed and if they continue to struggle and try to sell the country out and
[28:11.520 --> 28:16.360]  lower its defenses and bankrupt it and bringing third world populations to act as their political
[28:16.360 --> 28:21.080]  force to burn cities any time they want, then these so-called French leaders who are really
[28:21.080 --> 28:27.600]  collaborators need to be dealt with just like collaborators were dealt with in 1942, 43,
[28:27.600 --> 28:33.560]  44 and 45, they need to be swinging from the ends of ropes and they will be if they keep
[28:33.560 --> 28:39.800]  pushing it, Junker, Macron, I'm not threatening them, I'm telling them just like Mussolini
[28:39.800 --> 28:44.480]  and Hitler and the Vichy French, Toto and all of them, you're gonna be swinging from
[28:44.480 --> 28:51.040]  the ends of ropes you little snot nose Rothschild sex toy, so you better know when to back down
[28:51.040 --> 28:57.120]  you piece of filth, the French are awakening and that's a good thing, we'll be right back
[28:57.120 --> 28:58.120]  stay with us.

[29:54.600 --> 29:55.600]  www.79cash.com
[29:55.600 --> 30:05.520]  Everybody knows that history documents it, but there is a cult in every culture and every
[30:05.520 --> 30:08.920]  system throughout history that wants to hurt children.
[30:08.920 --> 30:12.880]  They want to abort children, they want to disease children, they want to abuse children,
[30:12.880 --> 30:17.040]  they want to confuse children, they want their essence, they want their soul, they want their
[30:17.040 --> 30:22.120]  spirit, they want their power because they are our future.
[30:22.120 --> 30:26.240]  This Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ, not ultimate sacrifice, it is about
[30:26.240 --> 30:30.840]  the West, it is about a human future, it's standing with each other and believing in
[30:30.840 --> 30:31.840]  a better future.
[30:31.840 --> 30:36.040]  I just want to thank you all for your support, but I want to ask you all to pray for your
[30:36.040 --> 30:41.120]  own family, to pray for America, to pray for President Trump, to pray for Info Wars and
[30:41.120 --> 30:45.920]  to remember that you have the power to change the world, you have the power to override
[30:45.920 --> 30:51.080]  the sensors, you have the power to stop the globalist dead in their tracks, you've been
[30:51.080 --> 30:55.600]  taken action, I salute you, but just remember, I know you're humble, but just remember, you
[30:55.600 --> 31:00.360]  hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[31:00.360 --> 31:06.240]  Info Wars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family,
[31:06.240 --> 31:11.120]  the eugenics operations, the whole thing, we've been proven dead on, you've been proven
[31:11.120 --> 31:15.600]  dead on as supporters and listeners of this project, you've been the men and women of
[31:15.600 --> 31:21.040]  the arena and I really do thank you and salute you all, words are not enough.
[31:21.040 --> 31:24.960]  Think about it, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies
[31:24.960 --> 31:30.640]  that you have been on target, promoting Americana and Renaissance and open free society against
[31:30.640 --> 31:35.200]  the globalist and the dominant world force, they've created a tower of babel and a bunch
[31:35.200 --> 31:39.360]  of people that can't communicate with each other, but we have cut right to the chase,
[31:39.360 --> 31:44.040]  human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future, and that's why
[31:44.040 --> 31:47.800]  I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that Info Wars really
[31:47.800 --> 31:52.640]  is your baby, I am in your hands and we're under unprecedented attack and we just need
[31:52.640 --> 31:57.200]  you to go to infowars.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever
[31:57.200 --> 31:59.880]  and funding Info War, a true 360 win.
[31:59.880 --> 32:04.760]  In the last few months, Info Wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory
[32:04.760 --> 32:08.160]  of many of our best-selling items and then I came up with the idea last week, let's not
[32:08.160 --> 32:12.960]  just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50 to 75% off double-patriot points, let's
[32:12.960 --> 32:19.080]  extend that sale but also add a free gift with every order.
[32:19.080 --> 32:23.120]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue, you'll
[32:23.120 --> 32:28.840]  get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last, and what I mean by that is
[32:28.840 --> 32:32.720]  everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out, so whatever you order
[32:32.720 --> 32:37.000]  that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out, then there'll
[32:37.000 --> 32:41.080]  be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders, so in the next 12 days we
[32:41.080 --> 32:46.400]  are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had, so this is a loss leader, we are
[32:46.400 --> 32:50.160]  losing money on this, this is our biggest sale ever, get your free gift, you're free
[32:50.160 --> 32:55.080]  shipping everything, and don't fight the crowds, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or

[33:22.640 --> 33:42.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live, Friday, worldwide broadcast
[33:42.640 --> 33:52.360]  on your host Alex Jones, I'm going to plunge right into the globalist's latest attempt
[33:52.360 --> 33:58.440]  to literally take over and take down the nation states, now people are battling back in just
[33:58.440 --> 34:03.240]  an incredible way, but also how the globalists are counter striking against that, and the
[34:03.240 --> 34:08.680]  tactics they're using to stop it, and some of the other tactics they haven't quite completely
[34:08.680 --> 34:14.160]  used yet that we need to be aware of are in their quiver, so that's coming up here in
[34:14.160 --> 34:20.560]  just a few minutes, Tim Fruget and Pat Riley, two of the guys that work here, are the guys
[34:20.560 --> 34:26.960]  a lot of times that bring me some Soros, Hillary funded lawsuit, or some new threat, a lot
[34:26.960 --> 34:30.920]  of times they bring me bad news, which I always demand to have immediately, as we're ready
[34:30.920 --> 34:38.080]  to face the day, not stick our heads in the sand in this fight for liberty, but they came
[34:38.080 --> 34:43.040]  in just about 15 minutes ago during the last break and said, hey, boss, we've got some
[34:43.040 --> 34:49.800]  bad news for you, bad news folder, and I said, what, another lawsuit, or something like that,
[34:49.800 --> 34:53.880]  or somebody's dead, and they said, oh no, it's actually good news, here's your presence
[34:53.880 --> 34:57.160]  of your TV viewer, you can see this, again, I'll describe it for any listeners, can we
[34:57.160 --> 35:02.240]  zoom in a little bit more, please, thanks, you can see there that it's Vladimir Putin,
[35:02.240 --> 35:11.440]  Donald Trump, and Alex Jones on blue Christmas paper with snowflake sign, so I don't know
[35:11.440 --> 35:17.280]  what this is, but I said, is this kosher for television, can I, can I open this on there,
[35:17.280 --> 35:20.800]  so this is a big surprise, and I'm gonna not make you wait till the end of the show, like
[35:20.800 --> 35:25.120]  other talk shows, so do to see what it is, I'm going to tear this open, I had to tell
[35:25.120 --> 35:32.040]  them, this is custom wrapping paper, and they said, oh yes, it's custom wrapping paper,
[35:32.040 --> 35:40.160]  so let's see what on earth this is, I know they seem really excited in there, crap, I
[35:40.160 --> 35:44.760]  just dropped whatever it is behind me, that just builds a suspense even more, so just
[35:44.760 --> 35:49.680]  slid out on the ground over there, will somebody bring that to me, thank you, so it's two pieces
[35:49.680 --> 35:52.880]  of cardboard with something sandwiched between it, I'm about to find out what it is, thank
[35:52.880 --> 36:06.040]  you very much, oh my god, okay, it is a Brian Stelter calendar, and I will not be hanging
[36:06.040 --> 36:10.680]  this in the kitchen because that would cause me to not be able to enjoy my food, I certainly
[36:10.680 --> 36:16.160]  won't be hanging it in the gym because that would be depressing, maybe I can hang it like
[36:16.160 --> 36:22.960]  above the garbage cans in the garage, now let's zoom out for radio listeners and TV
[36:22.960 --> 36:28.160]  viewers, oh my goodness, so there is his head photoshopped, or are these real photos of
[36:28.160 --> 36:32.640]  Brian Stelter, he really is into himself, he doesn't know how, oh my gosh, there he
[36:32.640 --> 36:42.600]  is moving a large stump, country boy, oh my gosh, what in the hell is that, Brian Stelter
[36:42.600 --> 36:51.200]  with rose petals on his chest, oh here's another one, Brian Stelter is a leprechaun, oh my
[36:51.200 --> 36:57.480]  gosh, here's another one, Brian Stelter as a child on Easter, Brian Stelter having a
[36:57.480 --> 37:07.120]  beer, okay well that is truly hideous, this obviously is not true, this is Brian Stelter
[37:07.120 --> 37:13.120]  wrapped in an American flag, we know he hates America, Brian Stelter walking around in a
[37:13.120 --> 37:21.000]  backyard, Brian Stelter is a fireman, again he's in all of these sexy poses here, Brian
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.840]  Stelter in the pumpkin patch, Brian Stelter with a pumpkin pie, I'm not going to describe
[37:25.840 --> 37:32.520]  for listeners what he's doing with it, Brian Stelter again this is truly hideous, okay
[37:32.520 --> 37:42.640]  guys you've outdone yourself, I really feel like I've been assaulted, sorry for TV viewers,
[37:42.640 --> 37:46.720]  this is unbelievable, why don't we hang this in one of the conference rooms and actually
[37:46.720 --> 37:52.040]  use it to put notes on, does it let us know and remind us who we're fighting here, please
[37:52.040 --> 37:59.360]  take it away, oh that's supposed to cheer me up, take him off the screen please, we've
[37:59.360 --> 38:06.440]  seen enough of Stelter, thank you, gotta have some fun around here, I think the guys are
[38:06.440 --> 38:14.040]  trying to do that, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, that's enough, seriously, we're
[38:14.040 --> 38:19.120]  having a lot of fun in there, we're going to have a new t-shirt, the design just got
[38:19.120 --> 38:26.760]  sent off to our Texas printers, that'll be out, it'll be done next week, we'll have
[38:26.760 --> 38:34.720]  them in by the new year, but we'll start pre-sales on these next week, and then you'll get them
[38:34.720 --> 38:41.920]  in the first of the year, but it is actually warms my heart, and I'll just tell you it
[38:41.920 --> 38:49.960]  has to do with Alexandra Cortez, the incredibly hilarious, I mean she gives Hank Johnson a
[38:49.960 --> 38:57.040]  run for his money for being stupid, we're going to have her, but let's just say it involves
[38:57.040 --> 39:03.600]  a dog, and let's just say it involves Trump's tweet that his son put out that she said she's
[39:03.600 --> 39:07.880]  going to have him criminally investigated for, and have him subpoenaed to Congress, which
[39:07.880 --> 39:15.400]  is illegal for his political activity, where Trump said in America, in capitalist countries
[39:15.400 --> 39:23.840]  we walk our dogs in socialist countries like Venezuela, you eat your dogs, and so since
[39:23.840 --> 39:28.600]  she wants to turn us into Venezuela, in her own words, Bernie Sanders has praised Hugo
[39:28.600 --> 39:33.960]  Chavez in Venezuela, and praised her, since she's done that too, literally you can say
[39:33.960 --> 39:39.560]  that chicken in every pot was the saying that FDR had, that everybody would get more food
[39:39.560 --> 39:45.560]  during the depression, chicken in the pot every night, well, we're talking about a dog in
[39:45.560 --> 39:51.360]  every pot, he's going to be Cortez's slogan, and just like we said Hillary for prison,
[39:51.360 --> 39:56.360]  2016 we launched that meme, you launched that meme, it became incredibly powerful and had
[39:56.360 --> 40:03.200]  a massive, massive effect, we are going to make her head on a dog, and they're going
[40:03.200 --> 40:09.440]  to say you're calling women dogs, no, just Cortez, a socialist, not a dog, we're saying
[40:09.440 --> 40:13.680]  we don't want her and her ignorance to be consumed by the socialism she's promoting,
[40:13.680 --> 40:20.840]  it kind of has that a pun or is it a double entendre, or it has a double meaning, she's
[40:20.840 --> 40:26.080]  a dog, and we're saying let's not eat the dogs, because it's the people that bring
[40:26.080 --> 40:29.960]  in socialism a lot of times who are idiots like her, and I think she probably believes
[40:29.960 --> 40:34.040]  in it, that don't understand it, it ends up literally destroying them and their country
[40:34.040 --> 40:40.920]  as people eat themselves alive, okay, I'm going to get very focused and very serious
[40:40.920 --> 40:50.600]  now, and we're going to go to break and come back, and I'm going to get into some good
[40:50.600 --> 40:54.080]  news, and then I'm going to get into some more good news, then I'm going to get into
[40:54.080 --> 40:59.480]  some more good news, but then I will, a little bit behind, get to the bad news, how they're
[40:59.480 --> 41:08.240]  striking back, currently, and the other cards they've got in a little hand, and we think
[41:08.240 --> 41:12.800]  we're winning right now, but if we don't recognize how they can counterpunch and how
[41:12.800 --> 41:19.440]  they probably will, then we can lose, and you don't want to lose to these people because
[41:19.440 --> 41:26.160]  they're so bad, so that is coming up in the next segment, please don't forget, you stand
[41:26.160 --> 41:30.920]  between Info Wars and the Hillary criminal mob and Soros and the globalists, they publicly
[41:30.920 --> 41:37.480]  said get Info Wars off the air, they publicly said, shut down their free speech, they sacked
[41:37.480 --> 41:43.160]  all their systems on us and we're still standing, and in some ways we're stronger, getting more
[41:43.160 --> 41:50.400]  AM and FM stations, more TV stations, more cable stations, more hardcore visitors to newswars.com
[41:50.400 --> 41:55.680]  and infowars.com, but our reach, our tentacles as they would call them, as Brian Stelter calls
[41:55.680 --> 42:01.680]  them, calls me a virus, a disease, I have tentacles, so I guess if you're an evil globalist,
[42:01.680 --> 42:05.840]  I guess like a child molester would think police coming to bust them would be a bad
[42:05.840 --> 42:12.240]  thing, I'm not Stelter, he looks like a child molester, like the archetypal one, he sees
[42:12.240 --> 42:17.160]  me as a liberty, as a patriot guy, as a bad guy, so he kind of sees me as a monster, kind
[42:17.160 --> 42:20.880]  of get that, kind of like a pedophile would think the cops busted down their door to
[42:20.880 --> 42:25.480]  save kids in a basement would be bad as well, from his perspective, not Stelter, a fictional
[42:25.480 --> 42:33.880]  pedophile, it would be something quite horrifying, now continuing here, we have the biggest sales
[42:33.880 --> 42:40.840]  of the year running right now, on supplements, on books, on water filtration, on DVDs, on

[46:57.000 --> 46:59.000]  Thank you.
[46:59.000 --> 47:23.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:23.160 --> 47:27.880]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[47:27.880 --> 47:29.600]  You want to stop tyranny?
[47:29.600 --> 47:36.120]  Well so does he, live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[47:36.120 --> 47:42.640]  So, I'm not going to sit here and list all the African countries, all the Latin American
[47:42.640 --> 47:47.680]  countries, all the Asian countries, all the European countries, southern, eastern, western,
[47:47.680 --> 47:55.480]  the UK, the US, everywhere, nationalists and patriots are winning almost every election.
[47:55.480 --> 47:59.640]  People are awake to the world government, they're awake to how foreign populations
[47:59.640 --> 48:04.760]  of untrained, unskilled people, military aged men, are being brought in and then being kept
[48:04.760 --> 48:11.920]  on welfare and being allowed to commit massive crimes as a political detonator that the leftist
[48:11.920 --> 48:15.640]  can activate to burn down cities anytime they want.
[48:15.640 --> 48:21.760]  But see, the citizens like the Yellow Vesters spreading worldwide, they can burn things
[48:21.760 --> 48:27.080]  down too but instead of burning down the neighborhoods like the Islamists are ordered to do and
[48:27.080 --> 48:33.800]  then drive people out and move into those neighborhoods, the French can burn down the
[48:33.800 --> 48:38.960]  government officials' houses and cars and then in some cases kill them and that's why
[48:38.960 --> 48:42.680]  the French military, some of their top generals and others have written a letter, currently
[48:42.680 --> 48:47.720]  serving generals, to Macron saying you have battered our people, you have squeezed them,
[48:47.720 --> 48:53.280]  they're on the edge of total revolt and they have a right to revolt and you are involved
[48:53.280 --> 48:59.360]  in quote treason, just like the Vichy French were with Hitler.
[48:59.360 --> 49:02.600]  What is it when you open your borders and announce come here, everything's free and
[49:02.600 --> 49:07.500]  then let your people be robbed and killed and raised taxes to pay foreign currency,
[49:07.500 --> 49:12.120]  scam, carbon trading, bureaus, money?
[49:12.120 --> 49:14.680]  You are a traitor, you are a criminal.
[49:14.680 --> 49:22.400]  French generals accuse Macron of treason over UN migration pact, Paul Joseph Watson, infowars.com.
[49:22.400 --> 49:28.040]  Open letter says French citizens have another reason to revolt and that's the globalism
[49:28.040 --> 49:33.800]  and the generals mentioned the UN migration pact which says that it circumvents national
[49:33.800 --> 49:40.040]  sovereignty, even if a country doesn't want people in, the UN will bring them in and the
[49:40.040 --> 49:46.040]  EU army says it will force them in, if Italy or Macedonia or Greece don't accept it.
[49:46.040 --> 49:50.080]  Wow, that is beyond treason, that's an invasion.
[49:50.080 --> 49:54.840]  A group of French military generals have written an open letter to Emmanuel Macron accusing
[49:54.840 --> 49:58.240]  the French president of committing treason, he's not a French president, he's a globalist,
[49:58.240 --> 50:00.440]  by signing the UN migration pact.
[50:00.440 --> 50:05.880]  The pact which was signed by 164 nations on Monday, included France, is not legally binding
[50:05.880 --> 50:11.560]  but greases the skids for unlimited migration to be treated as a human right and criticism
[50:11.560 --> 50:15.240]  of mass migration to be treated as hate speech, already banning it in Europe.
[50:15.240 --> 50:19.720]  A letter written by General Antonio Martinez and signed by 10 other generals and Admiral
[50:19.720 --> 50:25.160]  and Colonel as well as former French minister of defense, Charles Milan, warns Macron that
[50:25.160 --> 50:30.160]  the move strips France of more sovereignty and provides an additional reason for an already
[50:30.160 --> 50:36.240]  battered people to quote revolt.
[50:36.240 --> 50:40.920]  And you read the letter, it gets hardcore and gets into the treason and how they're ignoring
[50:40.920 --> 50:44.640]  the laws of the republic and how they're going to bankrupt the nation by design and
[50:44.640 --> 50:51.240]  the EU is basically scuttling France and that the UN is doing it, that it's part of a greater
[50:51.240 --> 50:59.400]  Europe project to dominate France and that the country is going to fall and that they're
[50:59.400 --> 51:09.720]  quote erasing our civilization and they go on to warn him, do not shine on even though
[51:09.720 --> 51:15.240]  France says they've adopted, don't shine your own treason warrant.
[51:15.240 --> 51:19.400]  Meanwhile, Politico admits Sweden has one of the highest crime rates in the world when
[51:19.400 --> 51:24.480]  just 10 years ago had the lowest crime rate in the world and of course 90% of the crime
[51:24.480 --> 51:26.520]  is the Islamists.
[51:26.520 --> 51:32.960]  Meanwhile, will kill their children and women, fury over black South African politician,
[51:32.960 --> 51:36.920]  the leader of one of the biggest parties calls to kill whites.
[51:36.920 --> 51:41.280]  South Africans are outraged at the recent speech by local revolutionary socialist politician
[51:41.280 --> 51:44.680]  who called upon his followers to kill white people, including women, children, even pets
[51:44.680 --> 51:48.280]  owned by whites.
[51:48.280 --> 51:54.920]  Andel Myxenama, the leader of the founder of the pan-Africanist political party Black
[51:54.920 --> 52:00.440]  First and Land First, BLF, has been repeatedly heard using harsh language and of course right
[52:00.440 --> 52:05.960]  now the current president talks like that and they head to the communist party and they're
[52:05.960 --> 52:11.760]  like wow that looks like antifa outfits they're wearing, yes this is all Marxist crap.
[52:11.760 --> 52:15.080]  Then once the country is brought down these people are always killed by the new party
[52:15.080 --> 52:20.480]  that comes in but then the resources are stolen by offshore corporations and the Chinese are
[52:20.480 --> 52:24.440]  funding almost all of this and that's on record, the communist Chinese government.
[52:24.440 --> 52:29.800]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of this individual talking about we will kill their children
[52:29.800 --> 52:59.640]  and women, here it is.
[52:59.640 --> 53:20.920]  There's wind on there and he goes we're going to take your land all the rest of it, turn
[53:20.920 --> 53:21.920]  it off please.
[53:21.920 --> 53:28.160]  Of course he's using a microphone invented by western culture and he's wearing western
[53:28.160 --> 53:33.040]  clothes and he's standing on a stage in these big cities, there was almost no one in South
[53:33.040 --> 53:39.520]  Africa when the Dutch showed up 400 years ago and then Africans and others poured in
[53:39.520 --> 53:46.200]  because of the jobs and the money and the medicine and the rest of it and then now the
[53:46.200 --> 53:49.640]  murder rates what 10 times what it was under apartheid, I'm not defending apartheid either,
[53:49.640 --> 53:54.880]  they just figured out one evil for something even worse and the whole society is collapsing
[53:54.880 --> 53:59.400]  and then you've got the communist pan-African party all over the place and once they've
[53:59.400 --> 54:09.720]  driven civilization out of there, the UN, ChaiKom funded race-based black parties will
[54:09.720 --> 54:15.040]  then start killing the other blacks and then everything will collapse, the Chinese love
[54:15.040 --> 54:19.120]  that because they don't ever build any infrastructure, they build their own cities with their own
[54:19.120 --> 54:24.480]  generators, put a fence up and then they don't assimilate, they don't talk to anybody, they
[54:24.480 --> 54:31.160]  just take the resources and move out except they are taking criminals who served up to
[54:31.160 --> 54:37.600]  five years in forced labor, they're telling them we will dump you out in Africa so they
[54:37.600 --> 54:42.200]  landed at airfields and they just dumped criminals out kind of like they did the British did
[54:42.200 --> 54:46.520]  to colonize Australia but all of those weren't real criminals obviously, well these Chinese
[54:46.520 --> 54:52.120]  probably aren't real criminals either, it's just one hell of a deal, I mean China is taking
[54:52.120 --> 54:58.960]  Africa over and man the Chinese are the most, they're great people, my sisters Korean adopted,
[54:58.960 --> 55:03.120]  the Koreans hate the Chinese, the Chinese hate the Koreans even more than they hate
[55:03.120 --> 55:08.080]  the Japanese and the Japanese absolutely hate the Chinese and the Vietnamese hate the Chinese
[55:08.080 --> 55:15.000]  more than anybody, they had like five wars with them but no one even knows all this,
[55:15.000 --> 55:18.240]  oh but don't worry the Southern Public Law Center this year said there's the dangerous
[55:18.240 --> 55:22.920]  myth of white genocide in South Africa, oh we only saw a bunch of other countries have
[55:22.920 --> 55:31.160]  all the whites driven out and mass murder in Zimbabwe and all these other places but
[55:31.160 --> 55:38.280]  the SPLC why, they say there's no, no go zones in Europe, they say there's no sexual mutilation,
[55:38.280 --> 55:44.360]  they say there's nothing happening, they say if you don't let your five year old get told
[55:44.360 --> 55:49.360]  he's really a girl, if he's a boy or vice versa, you're bad too, just let men, breasts
[55:49.360 --> 55:53.320]  like women, come talk to your kids in school about their sexuality, if they did it at the
[55:53.320 --> 55:56.720]  park they'd get arrested but at the school sanctions that you don't want the Southern
[55:56.720 --> 56:01.240]  Public Law Center to talk bad about you do you, alright I'll get more into it in the
[56:01.240 --> 56:05.360]  next hour and open the phones up but let me just tell you, we're winning against this
[56:05.360 --> 56:10.920]  evil worldwide but you see the globalist Marxist angle they use to destabilize the race war,
[56:10.920 --> 56:14.400]  they're trying it in Europe, they're trying it here and they don't have a big enough population,
[56:14.400 --> 56:19.120]  for race war they import it, how are they countering it, with censorship, with calling
[56:19.120 --> 56:24.520]  you racist if you say no to it, if you say your nation even exists you're bad, the racist
[56:24.520 --> 56:28.000]  groups they're organizing are just cannon fodder, they're just the useful idiots but
[56:28.000 --> 56:34.800]  they're also targeting, they're also targeting the people that speak up and tell the truth
[56:34.800 --> 56:39.360]  and presidents like President Trump and others for destruction, they know they can't stop
[56:39.360 --> 56:43.640]  the wave of awakening all over the world so instead they just want to pick off all the
[56:43.640 --> 56:48.840]  leadership of it, of any type of populist nationalist movement so it can never actually
[56:48.840 --> 56:53.600]  then deliver the goods by turning culture and society around, bringing in people that
[56:53.600 --> 56:59.800]  want to assimilate into western culture and free market and moving forward into the next
[56:59.800 --> 57:04.640]  level of human development, instead they've decided on a post-industrial world of haves
[57:04.640 --> 57:11.480]  and haves nots, giant underclass, a tiny ruling technocracy class who then basically brings
[57:11.480 --> 57:16.320]  in a worldwide tyranny, then allowing the remnants of the west to then sign on to a
[57:16.320 --> 57:22.440]  mass genocide program to wipe out the entire third world population, that'll be about
[57:22.440 --> 57:28.200]  nine billion when the main extermination plan is released according to my analysis and timelines.
[57:28.200 --> 57:32.960]  So that's the plan, I'm trying to not move to the level when the robot drones are going
[57:32.960 --> 57:39.480]  to release something like weaponized mouthpots of 99% kill rate over South Africa, but the
[57:39.480 --> 57:44.000]  bases in many areas have already been built and we're looking at fifth generation delivery
[57:44.000 --> 57:53.000]  systems, these aren't your grandpa's helicopters.
[57:53.000 --> 57:57.960]  Years ago InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal
[57:57.960 --> 58:02.360]  yeast, as the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team
[58:02.360 --> 58:06.360]  knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[58:06.360 --> 58:11.600]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed
[58:11.600 --> 58:15.800]  to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better
[58:15.800 --> 58:17.760]  product to help your body fight back.
[58:17.760 --> 58:22.520]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive
[58:22.520 --> 58:27.000]  tract and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked,
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.280]  powered by an impressive list of ingredients including grapefruit seed extract, poudarco
[58:31.280 --> 58:35.880]  bark and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test
[58:35.880 --> 58:38.880]  of time as powerful microbalancing properties.
[58:38.880 --> 58:50.280]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com, that's InfoWarsLife.com.
[58:50.280 --> 58:54.520]  I don't have to tell our listeners and viewers how important InfoWars is in the fight against
[58:54.520 --> 58:55.520]  the anti-human globalist.
[58:55.520 --> 59:00.720]  So let's say it's short and sweet, when you hear support now, more than ever, you come
[59:00.720 --> 59:04.840]  through a thousand times since I'm not bitching at you, I'm just simply telling you, we're
[59:04.840 --> 59:10.000]  in the thick of the battle now, the attacks on InfoWars have become absolutely exponential
[59:10.000 --> 59:12.840]  and down the road we probably will get destroyed.
[59:12.840 --> 59:16.640]  But I know and God has really put it on my heart that we've got to maintain the fight
[59:16.640 --> 59:22.200]  as hard as possible and go through as much as we can to be an example to others and carry
[59:22.200 --> 59:25.280]  out critical operations ahead of whatever happens.
[59:25.280 --> 59:29.240]  But I want to be strong in this fight, I need to be provisioned and I'm willing to stand
[59:29.240 --> 59:33.120]  against Hillary and Soros and the Rothschilds and all these devil worshipers, but I need
[59:33.120 --> 59:36.400]  your prayers, I need you to spread the articles and videos, I need you to give us financial
[59:36.400 --> 59:37.400]  support right now.
[59:37.400 --> 59:41.440]  We make it easy, do your Christmas shopping with us, not with the globalists and not with
[59:41.440 --> 59:45.280]  Bezos and Amazon and you'll help provision us.
[59:45.280 --> 01:00:13.760]  We've got a bunch of huge deals at InfoWarsStore.com, so please take action right now.
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:42.960]  I intend to open the phones up for the balance of the broadcast coming up at the bottom of
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:01:10.840]  the
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:14.400]  That's an understatement and victor's right to history as well, but
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:22.320]  Science took over in the last 200 years there's been good parts of science and then bad parts the way it's been used
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.280]  And the way people were kept in the dark, you know
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:32.800]  The black box nature of technology that you can hide Trojan horses into it or a lot of technology that's adopted supposedly has one use
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.680]  But really it has a whole nother use
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.960]  And you're just a cog within that
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:42.160]  Just like Google and Apple and all the rest of it
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.480]  But this diabolical world government system
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.400]  Has something going for it
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:59.960]  It's so horrible. It's so evil. It's over the top that people really have trouble grasping it
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:05.200]  But that's also its weakness if people ever do begin to grasp it and
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:12.720]  And if it ever becomes interesting for people to learn how it works like you learn how football works. You learn how baseball works
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:18.600]  Men can learn all that complex stuff or women know all about their favorite sitcom or
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:25.800]  Maybe they're into clothing or flowers or whatever it is people motorcycles
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.040]  But if people ever got into how things really work
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:40.880]  and the different thought processes and the different philosophies in world history and that one of the dominant philosophies
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.520]  Was developed by Plato the chief
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.840]  Philosopher of all time the fount
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.880]  That you would know that Plato was basically
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:59.480]  Like Adolf Hitler in fact most of what Adolf Hitler talked about and did came from
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.960]  Plato and
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.880]  Frederick Nietzsche who Hitler got a lot of stuff from who got it from Plato
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:09.240]  Plato not Plato Plato
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:17.280]  But you have to understand the globalists have bet that you're gonna lay down and
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.720]  They've got to be stopped themselves because
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:28.640]  They're the most unhappy wicked out of control people who think humanity is obsolete
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:38.480]  Because they deep down hate themselves and they are projecting they are projecting that on to us
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:46.920]  Now we can talk about some of the things they could pull
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:54.080]  To get nationalism back under their control economic world collapse. They're already trying that admitting that's their plan
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:59.840]  Race war they're already doing that attacking leaders like Trump
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.920]  Myself and
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:07.800]  Tucker Carlson anybody else that's willing to
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:16.480]  Walk the line for the republic walk the line for our nations walk the line for real renaissance and real open free societies and
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:22.680]  They're gonna organize the political systems into a bullying machine to bully you and
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.320]  their social credit score and
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:30.120]  Systems to not just censor you but punish you because you don't submit to them
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:36.960]  But what everyone has to understand is the current fake leftist Marxist order is only what they use to overthrow things?
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:44.440]  What comes in after it is far worse and the people that are being agitated to act as the cannon fodder for this need to understand
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:51.280]  With a hundred percent certainty that they're useful idiots and that they are going to be the number one enemy of the globalist if their
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.640]  operation succeeds
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.760]  We'll be right back
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:02.680]  Our grandparents and great grandparents knew that they can't food during the fall so you have it during the winter

[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:36.480]  It's Friday
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.880]  December 14th 2018
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:44.560]  I'm your host Alex Jones, and I'm here money through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:47.200]  To 3 p.m. Center
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.480]  Then we've got
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:52.680]  The war room with Owen shroyer roger stone don't forget David Knight
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:56.400]  Weekday mornings 8 a.m. With the David night show
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.520]  Well, Donald Trump was proven right again
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.760]  He said if you vote for the Democrats in the midterms, which we really didn't do but
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:08.520]  They stole enough of the elections to get the house. That's clear. They got caught all over the country
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:14.080]  He said if they get into office, they're announcing more regulations and the Federal Reserve is gonna see me as weak
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:17.120]  And they're gonna raise interest rates some more and that's gonna kill the recovery
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:21.400]  And the Democrats are siding with China in the trade war
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.400]  to screw us over
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.720]  Just as Ross Perot warned us so many years ago
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.760]  and
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.760]  so now to
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:39.080]  Add insult to injury the Dow Jones industrial averages down another 400 points
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:46.200]  Amid rising fears over global warming and the Federal Reserve has announced that they are going to raise interest rates more
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:51.760]  And the Dow is down 419 points. Oh, but the Fed said they won't raise it as much as they were before
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.960]  Well, the damage has already been done. So I want to get to Pelosi saying that
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.480]  She'll shut the government down forever
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:08.600]  Before we build a wall to stop all the human smuggling of MS-13 after all she called them God's children
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.280]  Because it's her program. It's the same as in Europe
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:17.680]  Flooding them with military-age men. They're bringing in the outside group loyal to them
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:25.320]  The Democrats have lawyers that skim the money off of the drug gangs and off of the mules and off of the people human trafficking
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:32.480]  I read the Texas news folks and I see it every few months in a Texas town. They bust the police chief
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:37.920]  Or the mayor or the mayor's brother or a city councilwoman
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:41.200]  And it's only when
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:46.680]  And it's only when the people they're smuggling get found dead in the back of an 18-wheeler or dead in their basement
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:53.880]  Yeah, what it was the mayor's brother a few years ago in Austin got caught with half beaten to death
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.760]  Families chained up in his Austin basement
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.760]  It's a family business
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:05.040]  And what they do is once they get these people in here, they don't have any papers. They don't anybody protect them
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.400]  They're all scared to talk to anybody and so you have
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:11.440]  Whether it's Asian gangs or whether it is
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  Hispanic gangs
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.640]  Or Nigerian gangs
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:22.800]  They get the people in here or Muslim gangs. They get the people in and then they are an underclass
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:28.160]  They control for human trafficking everything else. So it's it's so blood-sucking
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.120]  You know, the big thing they do is
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.120]  They'll have a factory
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.520]  This is what the Muslims do. There's a lot of famous cases of this
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:38.560]  They'll have a factory a dairy a
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.760]  A
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:46.960]  Place that processes leather. I mean, there's a lot of these and they'll bring in the people on their work visas
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:53.360]  They control them the emem watches them. They work in the factory and then they're all told get on welfare
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:58.880]  And that welfare is given back to the emem and back to the Democrats to then run people from political office
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:02.240]  And they skim the money and this is what they left in the third world
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:07.600]  And they skim the money and this is what they left in the third world. They're totally used to this. So we need
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:14.880]  The justice department to bust these folks and by the way, it has exploded under trump, but it hardly gets any coverage
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.520]  You know something else just an history lesson here
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:23.200]  We forget that trump got rid of the exemption on property taxes
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:27.040]  On million dollars and more
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:30.800]  Why do you think real estate is so expensive in blue cities in blue states?
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:33.680]  Why is real estate
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.320]  10 times 20 times
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.320]  What it is saying Dallas, Texas
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:45.200]  Because they allow an exemption for property tax off of income tax
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  So people launder their money
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:54.880]  Through the high property tax it never goes back out on the real tax rolls to the federal government
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:11:03.600]  It goes to democrat-controlled cities who then use that massive war chest. I mean on average democrat-controlled cities around this country have
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.320]  property taxes
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:12.000]  I mean austin has the highest property taxes in the state by a long shot and they're democrats
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:19.280]  And that's how they run their scam, but oh they all have a tax exemption they all have a
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:25.040]  A charity that their house is in and the helicopter is in and the Mercedes is in
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.480]  These democrats don't pay a dime ever
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:33.760]  They've got mexicans chained up in the basement. That's what they've got
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:41.040]  How many times have you seen the un with diplomatic community and they find a couple trunks with dead women in them?
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:47.440]  How many times is a woman run crying out in mad hatton with blood pouring down her back
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.440]  And her teeth knocked out
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:52.560]  And they deliver the woman back
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.720]  to the un official
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.160]  I've probably seen articles like that in 23 years on air
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:08.000]  Maybe 800 a thousand times, but it's always just a little footnote and I talked to cops
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:16.080]  In dc and in new york and in houston, there's a lot of embassies they call them consulates
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:24.880]  It's not the main national and they go. Oh, yeah routinely routinely there's this chinese
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:30.080]  Delegates are driving around with whole cold trunks full of cocaine
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:34.320]  And they'll be drunk driving and run over somebody and the cops get there
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:41.360]  And they they just jump out and flash the diplomatic community and the police can't do a thing. See that's what globalism is
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.400]  A global superclass above the law
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:52.400]  The un all of the world owns the diplomatically immune aircraft
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:56.720]  They had paramilitary forces and in every country they operate
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:01.520]  They smuggle children and women
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:11.920]  And when they get caught when the woman escapes in saudi arabia or wherever it doesn't even make the news
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:20.800]  Now do you understand the un and this whole collection and and and left us in every country around the same scams
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:27.840]  They've brought in 15 million people most of military men the last six seven years to europe
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:32.240]  Plus percent are still on welfare. They're not allowed to get jobs and they just pay a skim
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.880]  to the local socialist
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:41.360]  That's why they're so hard to beat they've got the money and they're criminal and they'll do anything
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:48.000]  So trump even though it hurt his businesses and his properties
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:52.480]  Trump's lost two billion dollars. It's reported just since he got in office and then ran
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:58.960]  But trump took away most of his exemptions on income tax
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.840]  Because he wanted to burn the democrats and the bluestaters
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.520]  And he's costing them
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:14.080]  It's record taxes coming in and it's because of that. In fact, some numbers are it's over 50 billion dollars
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:16.480]  since he got that repealed
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.040]  50 billion dollars
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:22.560]  That democrat bluestate people have had to pay
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.880]  I love it. I love it
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  It's beautiful
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.080]  Trump is vengeance
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:41.360]  That's why they hating so bad and say so ineffective and he's such an idiot and everyone then repeats it and thinks they're smart
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.920]  If they say trumps an idiot even so called conservatives
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:50.800]  Trump's done incredible things with almost no one around him that'll actually work with him
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:59.360]  So my support of trump is not just some ass kissing contest because all I get is hate and lawsuits and demonization
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:00.640]  for standing with president trump
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:06.320]  But I do it because he's standing with his word and doing the best job he can but the bad news is we'll come back and play all the clips
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.520]  Is that he's surrounded by such traitors
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:14.000]  He's been given a multi thousand page nafta agreement renegotiation nafta got agreement
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.280]  That has law to see you in crap in it
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:22.640]  It has the end of free speech codified in it the end of section 230
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:28.240]  It's really bad and let me stripped out in ratification
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.640]  but that's why
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:35.040]  The left ones control the congress because they want to just ram all this stuff through but um
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.840]  And trumps dropped the ball on fighting vaccines, but
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:42.400]  The point is is he's not ill or eclipsed and that's why they want to take him out
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:47.840]  All right, we're gonna play the clips when we come back up a situation with the border and a little clip about how ross perot
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:53.840]  Was right on the other side about the giant sucking sound stay with us. We'll be right back
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.840]  Hear that
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:01.840]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:04.400]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:11.840]  This year resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in go to fake tv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:15.440]  Someone inside is watching tv even when you're miles away

[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:23.840]  Be vigilant, but not fearful fake tv.com
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:29.840]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:33.840]  of the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:39.840]  The United States of Empire shows that world wars one and two left England broken
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:45.840]  Its former colony the us had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?

[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:06.840]  Now we've sold out of some of our best selling items but we've still got most of our best selling items in
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:10.840]  That's why I am extending the 12 days of Christmas for four more days
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:15.840]  Because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able to ship to anybody in the continental united states before Christmas
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:17.840]  At info wars store.com
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:21.840]  But get your orders in, don't fight those crowds and support the info war
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:26.840]  All the sales in the last 12 days, 50 to 75% off is back
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:28.840]  Free shipping is still there, double patriot points
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:31.840]  And we have even bigger sales on four new items
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:36.840]  Vitamin mineral fusion, myco zx, the t-shirts, all of it
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:39.840]  Just go check out the sales, they're assuming to break them all down
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:43.840]  Get your orders in by the 19th, you're guaranteed to get it on or before Christmas
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:48.840]  And thank you again all for your support, we're extending this sale until the 19th
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:53.840]  But info wars is in your hands, and again whatever you do just spread the word about info wars.com
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:55.840]  And we're going to beat the globals together, thank you
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:03.840]  In the last few months info wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best selling items
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:07.840]  And then I came up with the idea last week, let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store wide
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.840]  50 to 75% off, double patriot points
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:15.840]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:19.840]  Even if it's a tube, a fluoride free, colloidal silver, iodine 4 to 5, super blue
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:24.840]  You'll get a free gift of a best selling t-shirt while supplies last
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:28.840]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:33.840]  So whatever you order that day, there'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:36.840]  And then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:41.840]  So in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.840]  So this is a loss leader, we are losing money on this
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:48.840]  This is our biggest sale ever, get your free gift, your free shipping, everything
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:54.840]  And don't fight the crowds, infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or triple 8253-3139
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:20:07.840]  God bless you and thank you for your support
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:28.840]  So it's really simple
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:32.840]  There's a big private corporate world government with diplomatic immunity above the law
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:37.840]  They can rape and kill women and children, they can ship drugs anywhere they want
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:40.840]  They can even kill police officers inside people's countries
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.840]  They have just total control
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:46.840]  In Third World Nations the UN runs
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:48.840]  Now they want control here
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:56.840]  Remember, David Rockefeller's father had the plan for the UN to trick nations into a private corporate global government
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:21:01.840]  So they donated the land
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:06.840]  They can basically come into the nations and do whatever they want
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:12.840]  Once they've removed that national sovereignty
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:17.840]  And so they have the Democratic Party, the leftist parties in all the countries clamoring for no borders
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.840]  No walls, no USA at all
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:25.840]  Once the wages are driven down in the First World Nation
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:28.840]  It doesn't really drive them up the Third World Nation
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:36.840]  Then the Third World is migrated into the First World and you have one giant underclass you control
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:40.840]  And I know the listeners understand this, but this is the global fight
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:45.840]  And so Macron and Merkel and others, despite the fact that it's incredibly unpopular
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:49.840]  Despite the fact that it destroys the nations and bankrupts the pension funds
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:58.840]  They bring in the most ignorant, the most unwashed
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:05.840]  The most easily influenceable groups of people to literally be the political muscle
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:09.840]  But remember, you can see the French now burning down key targets
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:13.840]  It has the same effect as the leftist
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:16.840]  But the nationalists, the right wing, the Christians, the conservatives
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:20.840]  And that's what makes up the white knights of this whole thing
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:23.840]  That's what makes up the Yellow Vests
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:32.840]  They're targeting globalists and globalist shops and globalist companies and leftist groups and leftist government
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:33.840]  And that's the checkmate
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:38.840]  Oh, you can bring in the Muslims and have them burn down our neighborhoods if we don't do what you want
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:41.840]  How about we burn you down?
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:44.840]  And top French generals have written letters saying you're guilty of freedom
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:48.840]  Do not continue signing on to the UN Compact to open our borders further
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:51.840]  This is part of a larger globalist plan and we are done
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:56.840]  You are in danger of being arrested and the public has a right to revolt
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:00.840]  Some of those are current top generals. That's how far this is gone
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:04.840]  But that's what globalism is. Globalism is treason
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:10.840]  Against your nation, against common sense, against everything
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:13.840]  It's how you're conquered in the 24th century
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:19.840]  And Ross Perot was 100% right back in the debates in 1992
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:21.840]  Ross Perot was right
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:23.840]  Well, I think the question was
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:25.840]  It'll only take a minute to kill us, Nate. Go ahead
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:27.840]  Go ahead, kill it
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:30.840]  You're talking about the question, not me, right?
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:33.840]  No. Did you guys ever do anything but propaganda?
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:34.840]  Isn't it your business also?
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:36.840]  Would you even know the truth if you saw it?
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:37.840]  Oh, yes, sir
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:38.840]  I don't believe you would
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:42.840]  I just remember the debate between Al Gore, who was then Vice President, and Ross Perot
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:45.840]  Ross Perot was fiercely against Naftan
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:49.840]  Knowing what we know now, was Ross Perot right?
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:58.840]  All I can remember from that is a bunch of charts
[01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:02.840]  The single biggest threat to rescue civilization
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:07.840]  So, President Bush, I think you said it earlier
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.840]  A new world order
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:10.840]  Let's go
[01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:14.840]  And I think the first question is over here
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:18.840]  Yes, I'd like to direct my question to Mr. Perot
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:24.840]  What will you do as President to open foreign markets to fair competition from American business
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:29.840]  And to stop unfair competition here at home from foreign countries
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:33.840]  So that we can bring jobs back to the United States
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:36.840]  That's right at the top of my agenda
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:38.840]  We've shipped millions of jobs overseas
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:42.840]  And we have a strange situation
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:46.840]  Because we have a process in Washington where after you've served for a while
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:50.840]  You cash in and become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:53.840]  Then take a leave, work on presidential campaigns
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.840]  Make sure you've got good contacts and then go back out
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:00.840]  To those of you in the audience who are business people, pretty simple
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:04.840]  If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:06.840]  And you can move your factory south for border
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:09.840]  Pay a dollar an hour for labor, hire a young 25-
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:11.840]  That's the sum you've been in business for a long time
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:12.840]  You've got a mature workforce
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:14.840]  Pay a dollar an hour for your labor
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.840]  Have no health care
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:19.840]  That's the most expensive single element, making your car
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:22.840]  Have no environmental controls, no pollution controls
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:24.840]  And no retirement
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:27.840]  And you don't care about anything that's making money
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:30.840]  There will be a giant sucking sound going south
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:33.840]  So if the people send me to Washington
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:36.840]  The first thing I'll do is study that 2,000-page agreement
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.840]  And make sure it's a two-way street
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:41.840]  One last point here
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:43.840]  I decided I was dumb and didn't understand it
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:45.840]  So I called a who's who and the folks who've been around it
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:47.840]  And I said, why won't everybody go south?
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:48.840]  They said, we'll be disruptive
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:49.840]  I said, for how long?
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.840]  I finally got them up for 12, 15 years
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:53.840]  And I said, well, how does it stop being disruptive?
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.840]  And that is when their jobs come up from a dollar an hour
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:56.840]  To six dollars an hour
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:58.840]  And ours go down to six dollars an hour
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:25:59.840]  Then it's leveled again
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.840]  But in the meantime, you've wrecked the country
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.840]  With these kinds of deals
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:04.840]  We've got to cut it out
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:06.840]  Now you've inherited our problems
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:07.840]  We didn't listen!
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:08.840]  We didn't listen!
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:11.840]  And here we are
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:15.840]  25, 26, 27, 28 years later
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:16.840]  28 years later
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:17.840]  28 years later
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:18.840]  Wow
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.840]  And it all came true just like Ross Perot said
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:22.840]  Because it was a plan
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:23.840]  It's in the WikiLeaks
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:24.840]  It's in the Globalist Statements
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:28.840]  It's in CFR reports written 50 years ago
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.840]  They wanted to get rid of the first world
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:34.840]  Civilization is about having high wages and quality
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:39.840]  Civilization is about building an infrastructure for people
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:43.840]  But by setting an up where we did one side of deals with the third world
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:44.840]  We didn't help them
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:47.840]  We only helped transfer our industry and jobs
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:48.840]  To those countries
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:54.840]  So the globalists could then have the first world sue for peace
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.840]  Once we'd been turned into a
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:57.840]  Remember what was going to be back then?
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:00.840]  We're going to be a service economy
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.840]  In Europe and the US and Canada and Australia
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:05.840]  And now you like that service economy?
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:12.840]  Millennials are paid half of what their parents were paid
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:16.840]  And the folks older than that were paid more than that generation
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:18.840]  And now we have less savings
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:20.840]  Oh and what do the millennials want?
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:24.840]  They want socialism or communism 50 plus percent
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:25.840]  They've been brainwashed now
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:27.840]  And actually in the final phase
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:28.840]  As we collapse
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:31.840]  They think having everything free will fix it
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:33.840]  No it'll turn you into Venezuela
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.840]  So we're not just becoming poor
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:38.840]  We're becoming mentally ignorant
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:39.840]  And Pelosi
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.840]  Well she says if you even want the physical wall
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.840]  To stop the collapse of the third world
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:47.840]  Why transferring all our jobs down there was supposed to fix it
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:49.840]  She says if you even want that you can't have it
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:51.840]  And she'll shut the government down forever
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:52.840]  Well good lady
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:54.840]  Because you're shutting the country down forever
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:55.840]  Here she is
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:57.840]  Do you think he changes his calibration
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:27:59.840]  Even if you're able to pass a bill under your watch
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:01.840]  On the third of January
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:03.840]  His position ostensibly wouldn't change
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:06.840]  Why would he sign that bill to open government up in January?
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:10.840]  Does he want to have government closed forever?
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:12.840]  I mean what's this about?
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:14.840]  I know he doesn't believe in government
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:16.840]  I know he doesn't know that much
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:19.840]  About what is at risk to shut it down
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:22.840]  But I think that it would be
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:25.840]  Let's not talk about what might happen
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:28.840]  Let's not talk about what might happen
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:29.840]  Yeah that's right
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:32.840]  Let's not look at how the Democrats and Republicans
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.840]  Both signed up as lobbyists
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:37.840]  With foreign firms to pass the laws
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:40.840]  To then go join the firms to be paid millions
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:43.840]  Of dollars a year in many cases
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:44.840]  To be traitors
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:45.840]  That was it period
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:47.840]  They used our open society
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:48.840]  The globalist did to come in here
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:50.840]  And sell out everything
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:52.840]  And half the public hates the president
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:29:21.840]  We're trying to fix it
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:59.840]  In the last few months
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:00.840]  You have seen info wars
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:02.840]  Offered the biggest sales in our history
[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:04.840]  Now we've sold out of some of our best selling items
[01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:06.840]  But we've still got most of our best selling items in
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:09.840]  That's why I am extending the 12 days of Christmas
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:10.840]  For four more days
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.840]  Because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:13.840]  To be able to ship to anybody
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:15.840]  In the continental United States before Christmas
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:17.840]  At infoworksdoor.com
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:18.840]  But get your orders in
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:19.840]  Don't fight those crowds
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:21.840]  And support the info war
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:23.840]  All the sales the last 12 days
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:26.840]  50 to 75% off is back
[01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:27.840]  Free shipping is still there
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:28.840]  Double patriot points
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:30.840]  And we have even bigger sales
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:31.840]  On four new items
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:33.840]  Vitamin mineral fusion
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:34.840]  Myco ZX
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:35.840]  The t-shirts
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:36.840]  All of it
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:37.840]  Just go check out the sales
[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:39.840]  There's too many to break them all down
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:40.840]  Get your orders in by the 19th
[01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:41.840]  You're guaranteed to get it
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:43.840]  On or before Christmas
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:45.840]  And thank you again all for your support
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:48.840]  We're extending the sale until the 19th
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:50.840]  But info wars is in your hands
[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:51.840]  And again whatever you do
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:53.840]  Just spread the word about info wars.com
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:55.840]  And we're going to beat the globals together
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:57.840]  Thank you
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:00.840]  Everybody knows that history documents it
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:02.840]  But there is a cult in every culture
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:04.840]  In every system throughout history
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:06.840]  That wants to hurt children
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:07.840]  They want to abort children
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:09.840]  They want to disease children
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:10.840]  They want to abuse children
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:11.840]  They want to confuse children
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:13.840]  They want their essence
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:14.840]  They want their soul
[01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:15.840]  They want their spirit
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:17.840]  They want their power
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:19.840]  Because they are our future
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:21.840]  And this Christmas remember it is about Jesus Christ
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:22.840]  That ultimate sacrifice
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:24.840]  It is about the West
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:26.840]  It is about a human future
[01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:27.840]  And standing with each other
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:29.840]  And believing in a better future
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:31.840]  So I just want to thank you all for your support
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:34.840]  But I want to ask you all to pray for your own family
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:35.840]  To pray for America
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:36.840]  To pray for President Trump
[01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:38.840]  And to pray for info wars
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:41.840]  And to remember that you have the power
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:42.840]  To change the world
[01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:44.840]  You have the power to override the sensors
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:46.840]  You have the power to stop the globals
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:48.840]  Dead in their tracks
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:49.840]  I know you've been taking action
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:50.840]  I salute you
[01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:51.840]  But just remember
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:52.840]  I know you're humble
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:53.840]  But just remember
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:55.840]  You hold the future of this planet
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:57.840]  And the universe in your hands
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:59.840]  Info wars has been proven
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:02.840]  Absolutely on target about world government
[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:03.840]  The attack on the family
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:05.840]  The eugenics operations
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:06.840]  The whole thing
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:08.840]  We've been proven dead on
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:09.840]  You've been proven dead on
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:11.840]  As supporters and listeners of this project
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:13.840]  You've been the men and women in the arena
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:15.840]  And I really do thank you
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:16.840]  And salute you all
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:18.840]  Words are not enough
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:20.840]  Think about all the different systems
[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:22.840]  All the different political ideologies
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:24.840]  That you have been on target
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:26.840]  Promoting Americana and Renaissance
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:28.840]  An open free society against the globalist
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:30.840]  And the dominant world force
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:32.840]  They've created a tower of babel
[01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:34.840]  With a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other
[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.840]  But we have cut right to the chase
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:37.840]  Human liberty
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:38.840]  A pro-human future
[01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.840]  Versus the globalist anti-human future
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:42.840]  And that's why I want to thank you all
[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:43.840]  And ask you now more than ever
[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:45.840]  To remember that info wars really is
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:46.840]  Your baby
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:47.840]  I am in your hands
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:49.840]  And we're under unprecedented attack
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:51.840]  And we just need you to go to infowarsport.com
[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:53.840]  And do your Christmas shopping there
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:54.840]  And get the best deals ever
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:55.840]  And funding info war
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:33:16.840]  A true 360 win
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.840]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:29.840]  Thank you for joining us on this Friday
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:30.840]  Worldwide edition
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:31.840]  I'm Alex Jones your host
[01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:34.840]  The band websites are news wars.com
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:35.840]  Info wars.com
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:36.840]  And prisonplanet.com
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:39.840]  I want to give the phone number out
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:43.840]  And take your calls on a raft of issues
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:45.840]  But I'd like specifically to be on
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:47.840]  These topics as I want to get your take on this
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:49.840]  Are you upset with the private federal reserve
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:51.840]  Openly raising interest rates
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:52.840]  Well they didn't know on Obama
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:53.840]  To kill the economy
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:55.840]  And democrats running around celebrating
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:56.840]  Trying to drive it down
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:57.840]  And that's not even an issue
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:59.840]  We should make that a big political issue
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:00.840]  The president was right
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:01.840]  This is economic sabotage
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:03.840]  At the very same multinational banks
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:05.840]  That own our federal reserve
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.840]  Just like the EU controls England
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:08.840]  Even though they never voted to enter it
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:09.840]  This is just asinine
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:11.840]  These very same people are threatening
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:12.840]  Spain and Italy
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:14.840]  And all these other nations
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:16.840]  That if you try to pull out of the euro
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:18.840]  Or you don't keep your borders open
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:21.840]  We're going to implode your economy
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:23.840]  Well how about the militaries of those countries
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:25.840]  Arrest the agents of those companies
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:26.840]  In their countries
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:28.840]  How about we stop putting up
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:30.840]  With the white shoe boys
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:31.840]  Pulling this crap
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:33.840]  You know that's what Russia did
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:36.840]  Russia just arrested all the Rothschild
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:37.840]  Rockefeller agents
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:39.840]  And then the Rothschild sued
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.840]  What was it six, seven years ago
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:42.840]  A bunch of newspapers
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:45.840]  Saying we're not really running the oligarchs
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:47.840]  And the judge in some of the cases
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:49.840]  The Rothschilds lost all their money
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:52.840]  The Rothschilds lost all the cases
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:54.840]  Said it's incredible
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:56.840]  This defamation libel suit
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:00.840]  Proves you were doing this to Russia
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:03.840]  Why do we put up with this crap
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:05.840]  Why do we put up with Macron
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:07.840]  Saying we're going to have 200 million more people
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:09.840]  Brought in from overseas
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:11.840]  And that France is no longer France
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.840]  And the nation doesn't exist
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:14.840]  And then our media says
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:16.840]  Trump's evil, he says America exists
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:22.840]  And that he said the word nationalist
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:24.840]  I mean you talk about jumping the shark
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:25.840]  Ladies and gentlemen
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:29.840]  It's really, really insane
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:30.840]  So I want to talk about that
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:31.840]  I want to talk about Pelosi saying
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:33.840]  We'll just shut the government down forever
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:37.840]  To keep the border open
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:40.840]  And Sarah Sanders made a great point
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:42.840]  Democrats have decided they love our country
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:44.840]  More than they hate the president
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:45.840]  Because that's what they're doing
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.840]  Is trying to literally drive the country
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:48.840]  Into the ground
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:51.840]  Well, they've already decided, Sarah
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:54.840]  The Democratic Party says America was never great
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:55.840]  It'll never be great
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:56.840]  They're globalist
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:58.840]  They hate the country
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:01.840]  They're a criminal cabal that loots
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:04.840]  From their dumbest constituent
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:06.840]  Up to the top criminal kingpins
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:07.840]  That don't pay taxes
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:09.840]  We all know it
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:11.840]  Meanwhile, the Democrats were drooling
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:13.840]  Overgoing after Trump
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:15.840]  Campaign finance
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:18.840]  When it's not a campaign
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:20.840]  Contribution to a campaign
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:21.840]  When it's his private money
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:27.840]  To give money to an old fling
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:28.840]  But they're saying
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:31.840]  Well, any money he spent during a campaign
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:32.840]  Because it was during a campaign
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:33.840]  That was to make him look good
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:34.840]  For the campaign
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:36.840]  So that's a campaign contribution
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:38.840]  You know, the last five years
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:40.840]  They were down to one vote
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:43.840]  On the Federal Elections Commission
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:45.840]  And the head Democrat on it
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:46.840]  Won an info war shutdown
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:47.840]  And she said
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:48.840]  Just type it in
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:50.840]  A head Democrat on federal election submission
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.840]  Says shut down Alex Jones' info wars
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:54.840]  They had hearings
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:55.840]  Three years ago
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:56.840]  Two years ago
[01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:57.840]  She's off the committee now
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:00.840]  But they had the majority of the Democrats voting
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:02.840]  But the Republicans had one more vote
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:03.840]  And they were saying
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:05.840]  We're gonna shut down Alex Jones
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:07.840]  We're gonna shut down Matt Drudge
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.840]  Because everything they do
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:10.840]  Is Republican
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:14.840]  And so it's an in kind donation
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:15.840]  Total bull
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:17.840]  But that's how they're extending
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:19.840]  All this crap out
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:22.840]  And then they've got Cohen up there
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:24.840]  Saying the president told me to cover this up
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:26.840]  Cohen, you tried to record him
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:27.840]  You were probably already busted
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:28.840]  For this stuff years ago
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:30.840]  That's pretty clear
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:32.840]  And he said
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:33.840]  Yeah, we're gonna make the payment
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:34.840]  And Trump's like
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:35.840]  No, you're not
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:37.840]  What?
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:39.840]  These people are rats
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:40.840]  Imagine being a rat like Cohen
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:43.840]  And he's just always trying to set Trump up for years
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.840]  So he could get some leverage over him
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:47.840]  But he could never do it
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:50.840]  Because Cohen knew he was committing a whole bunch of crimes
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:53.840]  And now this admitted convicted criminal
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:57.840]  Who pled guilty to all these crimes
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:59.840]  He's now telling us the presence of that guy
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:00.840]  But just don't forget
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:01.840]  Where's the Russia?
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:02.840]  Where's the Russia?
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:03.840]  Where's the Russia?
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:05.840]  It doesn't exist
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:07.840]  And right now the Dow Jones industrial average is down
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:10.840]  Over 400 points
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:12.840]  And that makes the Democrats happy
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:13.840]  Because they want you poor
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:14.840]  They want you on welfare
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:16.840]  They want you not working
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:17.840]  They want you destitute
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.840]  Because they want to break you
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:21.840]  And control every facet of your life
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:23.840]  The toll-free number to join us
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:26.840]  Is 877-789-ALIX
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:30.840]  877-789-2539
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:34.840]  877-789-ALIX
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:36.840]  And that's the number for you to be able to join us
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:38.840]  And I'd love to hear from you on air
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:41.840]  877-789-2539
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:43.840]  Now remember, I'm not up here covering
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:45.840]  All this really negative bad stuff
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:47.840]  Because I want to demoralize you
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:48.840]  They want us off the air
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:52.840]  Because they know it's exposing what they're doing
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:54.840]  And that they won't be able to get away with it
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:56.840]  It's that simple
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:58.840]  And I'm not a litigious person
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:38:59.840]  I don't like lawsuits
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.840]  But I've learned that when we point out
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:03.840]  How business scams work
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:04.840]  That nobody else is doing
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:06.840]  When we point out how global scams work
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.840]  We point out how they're taking your blood at birth
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:10.840]  And giving it to big tech labs
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:12.840]  Who then patent your own proteins
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:13.840]  So when you need gene therapy later
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:16.840]  They tell you they own it
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:18.840]  Our research helped lead to lawsuits
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:19.840]  That are stopping that
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:21.840]  Just talking about it
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:23.840]  And people go research and go, wow, that's really true
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:25.840]  No one ever had that angle on it
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:28.840]  Well, it's the same thing
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:30.840]  With how the Democrats make the money
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:32.840]  Off of being immigration lawyers
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:34.840]  And how they then have mafias
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:36.840]  And skim money off these people
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:38.840]  But particularly Hispanics won't go to the police
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:40.840]  Because they're more corrupt in the third world
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.840]  Than anything else the police are
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:44.840]  And so they're the perfect group to be preyed on
[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:46.840]  And then meanwhile the Democrats act like
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:47.840]  They're their advocates
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:50.840]  Very, very sick, very, very evil
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:51.840]  So that's what we're doing
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:52.840]  We're covering all these things
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:56.840]  Because so much of what we do then
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:59.840]  Begins the debate, begins the discussion
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:01.840]  About things that no one else is talking about
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:03.840]  That's what info wars is important
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:05.840]  That's why you're important
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:09.840]  That's why your support of us isn't just critical
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:12.840]  It's absolutely imperative
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:17.840]  Right now
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:20.840]  George Soros, Hillary, the Democrats
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:22.840]  Are harassing and seeking out
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:24.840]  Any type of merchant account we have
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:27.840]  So that you can't even go to infowarstore.com
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:30.840]  And use a credit card, a debit card, a digital check
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:32.840]  Any of that, they want to block you
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:36.840]  From your right to commerce
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:38.840]  But they can't do it right now
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:39.840]  Because we have merchant accounts
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:41.840]  But I'm selling everything out
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:43.840]  So we don't have to pay inventory tax
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:45.840]  And so that we're funded a few months
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:48.840]  Over the next year regardless
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:51.840]  Infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:52.840]  Is where you go
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:54.840]  Infowarstore.com is the big umbrella site
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:56.840]  Infowarslife.com takes you right to the
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:58.840]  Suburl of the great supplements
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:00.840]  That are so popular
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:03.840]  We're bringing back all of the unprecedented
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:05.840]  12 days of Christmas specials
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:07.840]  Because the 12 days of Christmas was going to end tomorrow
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:09.840]  That's when we started it 12 days ago
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:10.840]  Or 11 days ago
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:11.840]  But I've decided
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:13.840]  Now some things are about to sell out
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:15.840]  But we're going to bring all the specials back
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.840]  We always have 50 to 75% off store-wide
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:20.840]  But particularly we'd have a best-selling item
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:22.840]  At 60% off
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:24.840]  All of those specials have been brought back
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:25.840]  On top of all the other specials
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:27.840]  And the free t-shirt with every order
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:28.840]  And the free shipping
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:31.840]  And the double-patriot points on your next order
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:34.840]  10% on each dollars and a 5%
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:36.840]  You can't beat it
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:38.840]  We're bringing back all of the unprecedented
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:40.840]  Christmas specials for a limited time
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:42.840]  Of the past 12 days at infowarstore.com
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:44.840]  We've launched some of the biggest specials ever
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:47.840]  To help you stock up on Christmas and support the Infowar
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:49.840]  These specials were such massive loss-leaders
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:52.840]  That we could only promote them for 24 hours
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:56.840]  But now we're bringing all of our Christmas mega-specials
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:58.840]  Back at infowarstore.com for a limited time
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:41:59.840]  Only
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:01.840]  And many are already completely selling out
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:03.840]  I have made the decision to completely sell
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:05.840]  All of our 2018 inventory
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:07.840]  At some of the lowest prices ever
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:08.840]  These are the lowest we've ever done
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:09.840]  By leaps and bounds
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:11.840]  To avoid paying ridiculous amounts
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:12.840]  Of government inventory tax
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:14.840]  This is your last chance to take advantage
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:15.840]  Of these Christmas super specials
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:17.840]  Including Rainforest Plus

[01:43:56.900 --> 01:44:00.940]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:06.180]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it
[01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:11.260]  literally dumbs the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:17.620]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First, seaweed based iodine
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:20.940]  that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a
[01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:25.900]  supply of it. So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought
[01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:30.700]  you X2. That's been incredible. Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we
[01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:36.660]  did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists,
[01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:41.500]  scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds,
[01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:49.540]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies
[01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:53.740]  and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:56.540]  X3, now available at infowarslife.com.
[01:44:56.540 --> 01:45:02.740]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory
[01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:06.140]  of many of our best selling items. And then I came up with the idea last week, let's not
[01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:10.860]  just extend the sale of free shipping store wide, 50 to 75% off double patriot points.
[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:17.580]  Let's extend that sale but also add a free gift with every order. Even if it's a tube
[01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:22.300]  of fluoride free, colloidal silver, iodine 4 to 5 super blue, you'll get a free gift
[01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:27.300]  of a best selling t-shirt while supplies last. And what I mean by that is everyone will get
[01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:31.460]  a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out. So whatever you order that day, they'll
[01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:35.660]  be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out. Then there'll be another shirt
[01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:40.140]  that goes up for the next group of orders. So in the next 12 days, we are going to have
[01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:45.780]  beyond any other sale we've ever had. So this is a loss leader. We are losing money on this.
[01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:49.220]  This is our biggest sale ever. Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything. And
[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:55.620]  don't fight the crowds, infohorselife.com, infohorselife.com, or triple 8253-3139. God
[01:45:55.620 --> 01:45:58.260]  bless you and thank you for your support.

[01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:22.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:37.940]  It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart. When I'm saying no word, you can
[01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:56.420]  light up the dark. Try as I may, I could never explain. What I hear when you don't say a
[01:47:56.420 --> 01:48:09.100]  thing. The smile on your face lets me know that you need me. There's a truth in your
[01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:10.100]  eyes saying you never need me.
[01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:12.060]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen. We're going to be going to your phone calls here
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:20.820]  in just a moment. But I thought I would just point out that Congressman Ted Liu went on
[01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:24.940]  national television a few days ago. We played it yesterday and said he would love nothing
[01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:32.100]  more than to silence people's speech. But that it's up to private companies to do it.
[01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:40.860]  And in all of this is the crux to everything. Because under section 230, the big tech giants
[01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:52.820]  have no right to censor anybody because they're given liability protection. That's now or
[01:48:52.820 --> 01:48:57.300]  I'm going to play Tucker Carlson's report on that for a segment. And I'm going to play
[01:48:57.300 --> 01:49:02.060]  Mark Dice's report on that for a segment. But first, we're going to take calls until
[01:49:02.060 --> 01:49:05.460]  the bottom of the next hour. And then Matt Bracken is going to be hosting on national
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:09.660]  security issues in the fourth hour. And I'll be back this Sunday. I'll be live 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:15.820]  I'm also going to come up here tomorrow and do a live special broadcast. And I'm almost
[01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:20.340]  tempted that I may be the person that hosts a weeknight show. I think I may have to double
[01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:28.700]  down here because there's the discipline of live that makes it get done. And in that is
[01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:33.580]  really what it all comes down to. We have to fight hard in this historical moment we've
[01:49:33.580 --> 01:49:47.220]  entered. Because you hear him say, I'd love to censor, but we're the government. We can't
[01:49:47.220 --> 01:49:54.060]  do it, but companies can. These companies operate as utilities under law. And I have
[01:49:54.060 --> 01:50:01.180]  all these Democrats come to me and all these reporters and they go, Alex, what should be
[01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:05.860]  changed? What should be done when they're ignorant? And they go, you know, what should
[01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:12.260]  the law be? And it's like, we already have a law. If I have a message board on infowars.com
[01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:18.980]  or newswars.com or a comment section, which we have, I'm not liable when a third party
[01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:23.220]  comes on there and says they're going to kill somebody. I just got to respond to the subpoena
[01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:30.020]  if I get one. And we have moderators that would generally take that down because that's
[01:50:30.020 --> 01:50:35.660]  illegal. But I'm still not liable because they could post it and then I'd be that second
[01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:43.300]  guilty. So that's how they play these games. It's been set up in law. Section 230 has been
[01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:48.860]  adopted all over the world. The U.S. invented the Internet. We came up with a system to
[01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:56.620]  regulate it. It's worked. It made sense. And now by fiat, these companies are simply getting
[01:50:56.620 --> 01:51:01.260]  rid of it. They're acting as publishers and they're deciding what to keep up. But when
[01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:12.540]  Sundar Pachai of Google gets up in front of Congress and he says, we do not censor or block
[01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:19.700]  Republicans or conservatives, we only do it to hate. Well, that's playing a game. Oh,
[01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:26.660]  we don't rape children and they put a sticker on a child, but we do rape bobblebops. It's
[01:51:26.660 --> 01:51:29.780]  really a children, but they just took a sticker on it calling it a bobblebop. You can use
[01:51:29.780 --> 01:51:35.060]  any stupid words you want it. But the Southern Parliament Law Center, this trusted flagger,
[01:51:35.060 --> 01:51:43.820]  the ADL, the trusted flagger, the media matters, Soros' arm, I mean, he funds them all, trusted
[01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:50.220]  flagger. Those are groups funded by the Democratic Party, by U.S. taxpayers, by the State Department,
[01:51:50.220 --> 01:51:57.140]  U.S. aid. Your tax money goes to George Soros. He keeps a heap in helping of it for himself.
[01:51:57.140 --> 01:52:01.060]  You don't think that criminal that pays no taxes is actually giving his money to you.
[01:52:01.060 --> 01:52:06.020]  He swindles it all in, hands it all out to the different groups, and they fund the migrant
[01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:10.780]  caravans and the open borders and the groups teaching your five-year-old how to give a
[01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:15.780]  good, you know what, how to wear a dress, your five-year-old son. They fund it all because
[01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:20.140]  he's an agent. It's his job. He helped fund the overthrow of the Soviet Union. But not
[01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:26.020]  to fix it, he helped set up the oligarchs to gang rape the Russians. He's a gang raper.
[01:52:26.020 --> 01:52:33.100]  It's what he does. He wants to rape your family financially, too. And have big, fat, ugly-looking
[01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:37.300]  pedophiles come in there and tell your five-year-old about sex and stuff that Daddy and Mommy
[01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:40.900]  wouldn't even talk to him about. But don't worry, you've got a new uncle. He's wearing
[01:52:40.900 --> 01:52:48.380]  a big purple wig. He's going to tell you about your dingaling. And people say, oh, that's
[01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:54.340]  really gross to sit on there. Hey, this is what they're teaching everybody's kids, man.
[01:52:54.340 --> 01:52:58.620]  And we just put up with it so there's a big, fat, green light, because men act passive
[01:52:58.620 --> 01:53:07.500]  to this type of crap. Well, I'm not acting passive to it anymore. It fundamentally makes
[01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:14.260]  me angry. But I'm putting that anger into action, and I'm asking you to do the same thing.
[01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:20.860]  So when you see Congressman Liu, we're about to play a clip of, I sat there in that committee
[01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:25.540]  hearing, 30 feet from him, watching him for hours. I couldn't get my eyes, you know, Hank
[01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:33.660]  Johnson was there, and Congressman Deutch and all these other weirdos. And Sheila Jackson
[01:53:33.660 --> 01:53:40.700]  Lee, I mean, it was like a gallery of weirdos. He kept talking under his breath, repeating
[01:53:40.700 --> 01:53:44.220]  what he was going to say when his statement came up, and I watched him do the statement.
[01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:52.140]  And you just talk about a robot. So when you hear what he says, he's been the Google executives
[01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:56.620]  on record donate money to him and Nadler and others, and they give them the press release,
[01:53:56.620 --> 01:54:00.700]  the talking points that they read back on the question. So sun dark and look so smart,
[01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:04.180]  they're all engaged in the perjury together. And he gets up there and talks about hate
[01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:07.980]  speech and Alex Jones and I've got to be banned. And another Congresswoman got up and said
[01:54:07.980 --> 01:54:18.300]  Oh, we've seen Alex Jones here today spreading his conspiracy theories. Yeah. And then he
[01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:23.380]  goes on national television, he says, I'd love to shut these right wingers up to something
[01:54:23.380 --> 01:54:31.020]  called the First Amendment. But it's the job of the companies. So he says it's the job
[01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:39.100]  of the companies to shut us up. Well, I mean, digitally now, you try to type in a cuss word
[01:54:39.100 --> 01:54:42.500]  in your iPhone or droid, it won't let you send it. Well, they're already saying that.
[01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:51.060]  Well, now, words like mother and father and she or he, those in certain sentences on iPhones
[01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:57.780]  and on Google searches, you're not going to be able to type them in. Wow. That was announced
[01:54:57.780 --> 01:55:04.980]  last week. Now you're not in Kansas anymore. What I said a few months ago when people all
[01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:10.580]  over the world couldn't send emojis of the Taiwanese flag period because China told Apple,
[01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:17.780]  we don't say that flag exists. And they said, yes, sir, boss. And for a month, you couldn't
[01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:22.540]  send that emoji. There was a backlash to it. But they keep doing it. They think someday
[01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:27.060]  you'll just give up, which people are doing. And that's this game of attrition. Push it,
[01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:32.180]  push it, push it, push it, do it, do it, do it, do it until people are so sick of being
[01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:37.740]  censored, they just finally just give up on the platforms altogether. So it's about who
[01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:41.900]  wants it most. You know what? You try to wear me out. That just makes me stronger. That's
[01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:48.540]  like what weightlifting is. But see, there's this passive spirit of malaise that comes
[01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:53.100]  over people and they don't have that animating spirit of liberty and it's like they're dead
[01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:57.940]  inside. And that's okay. But the dead bury the dead. As Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior
[01:55:57.940 --> 01:56:06.820]  said, but you're not dead. And that's why they hate you because I'm not that powerful.
[01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:14.260]  But this broadcast and this platform, like a photon tube that focuses a bunch of light
[01:56:14.260 --> 01:56:19.660]  into it, all of us together. This isn't some thousand points of light. That's an illuminati
[01:56:19.660 --> 01:56:23.900]  term, but they take everything that's real and they create a counterfeit. But the billions
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:29.860]  of points of light, God's spirit shining through us together, coming together with a broadcast
[01:56:29.860 --> 01:56:35.460]  like this. That's what they fear because that's like a particle beam of truth that can fire
[01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:41.540]  out. And that's what they're scared of. So we're gonna go to break, come back to your
[01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:48.140]  calls. But since I mentioned it, let's go out to break with Mr. Lou. Here it is.
[01:56:48.140 --> 01:56:53.580]  I'd love to be able to regulate the content of speech. The First Amendment prevents me
[01:56:53.580 --> 01:56:58.340]  from doing so. And that's simply a function of the First Amendment. But I think over the
[01:56:58.340 --> 01:57:03.620]  long run, it's better that government does not regulate the content of speech. I would
[01:57:03.620 --> 01:57:09.620]  urge these private sector companies to regulate it better themselves. But it's really nothing
[01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:14.460]  that I believe government can do. And so that's been my position all along.
[01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:18.260]  So they've sold this idea and the Heritage Foundation has done it too. Well, if it's
[01:57:18.260 --> 01:57:23.820]  Google bigger than most governments and it's got more data than the NSA, then it's okay.
[01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:27.620]  But it's a political group of Democrats, the globalists, Soros, who are actually running
[01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:33.620]  Google and deciding what can go up and what can't go up and what comes down. So incredible.
[01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:38.300]  And the Republicans are just now figuring out what's happened. They better figure it
[01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:47.420]  out real quick or it's game over. We'll be right back. Stay with me.
[01:57:47.420 --> 01:57:51.780]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:56.500]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[01:57:56.500 --> 01:58:02.180]  to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic, Metal and Chemical Defense
[01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:08.100]  Support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:13.420]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the M4. It is a classical 360 win.
[01:58:13.420 --> 01:58:17.900]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[01:58:17.900 --> 01:58:22.700]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:26.660]  get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of
[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:31.660]  this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as
[01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:36.940]  you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires
[01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:40.700]  to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support
[01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:44.580]  and your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies
[01:58:44.580 --> 01:58:46.580]  with Z Shield at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:58:46.580 --> 01:58:53.460]  In the last few months, you have seen InfoWars offer the biggest sales in our history. Now
[01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:56.700]  we've sold out of some of our best selling items, but we've still got most of our best
[01:58:56.700 --> 01:59:01.420]  selling items in. That's why I am extending the 12 Days of Christmas for four more days
[01:59:01.420 --> 01:59:05.380]  because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able to ship to anybody in the continental
[01:59:05.380 --> 01:59:10.100]  United States before Christmas at InfoWarsLife.com. But get your orders in. Don't fight those
[01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:17.100]  crowds and support the InfoWars. All the sales in the last 12 days, 50 to 75% off is back.
[01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:21.760]  Free shipping is still there. Double Patriot points and we have even bigger sales on four
[01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:27.900]  new items, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Myco ZX, the T-shirts, all of it. Just go check out
[01:59:27.900 --> 01:59:31.860]  the sales. There's too many to break them all down. Get your orders in by the 19th.
[01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:36.700]  We're guaranteed to get it. Honor before Christmas. And thank you again all for your support.
[01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:41.740]  We're extending the sale until the 19th, but InfoWars is in your hands. And again, whatever
[01:59:41.740 --> 01:59:45.740]  you do, just spread the word about InfoWars.com and we're going to beat the globals together.
[01:59:45.740 --> 01:59:46.740]  Thank you.
[01:59:46.740 --> 02:00:08.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. The answer to 1984 is 1776. Live from Austin,
[02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:35.460]  Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones. We're back live, ladies and gentlemen. Broadcasting
[02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:41.940]  worldwide about to go to your phone calls. Appreciate you all holding here. Who should
[02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:49.980]  we start with first here? Who's been holding the longest? Let's go to Walt in New York.
[02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:51.980]  Walt, thanks for holding here on the air. Go ahead.
[02:00:51.980 --> 02:00:54.020]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:58.060]  I'm doing pretty good. I mean, you know, you got the French military, top generals saying
[02:00:58.060 --> 02:01:02.340]  Macron should be arrested for treason, which is what's happening. So, I mean, people are
[02:01:02.340 --> 02:01:05.900]  starting to wake up. It's just people always wake up so late. How bad is this going to
[02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:07.300]  get before we turn it around?
[02:01:07.300 --> 02:01:12.500]  Well, we've got electronics going for us today. Alex, we're talking maybe to a million people,
[02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:13.500]  right?
[02:01:13.500 --> 02:01:18.820]  I would say probably more than that. You know, way back in 1913, when the Federal Reserve
[02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:24.020]  came in, very few voices really understood what it was, but the people who were behind
[02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:31.260]  it knew it held the ultimate political power to be able to create the currency, which was
[02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:38.140]  a power under the Constitution. But Congress gave it up to this private group of bankers.
[02:01:38.140 --> 02:01:43.260]  And Charles Lindbergh, Jr., who we know in the spirit of St. Louis, flew across the Atlantic,
[02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:49.060]  his father was a congressman at the time who fought valiantly against it. This is a quote.
[02:01:49.060 --> 02:01:54.540]  He said, this Federal Reserve Act establishes the most gigantic crust on earth. When President
[02:01:54.540 --> 02:02:00.940]  Woodrow Wilson signs this bill, the invisible government of the monetary power will be legalized.
[02:02:00.940 --> 02:02:07.780]  The worst legislative crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking and currency bill.
[02:02:07.780 --> 02:02:12.820]  So we've got two things. We've got this electronic power, which the founders didn't understand,
[02:02:12.820 --> 02:02:19.460]  but is vast. And if we lose this, we will lose the battle. We have to keep the First
[02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:26.460]  Amendment as it applies to electronics alive and well and apply antitrust to these big
[02:02:26.460 --> 02:02:31.540]  tech corporations. They have to be put in their place. We, the people, have to preserve
[02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:36.500]  that First Amendment because we lose the power to speak, then we'll lose it all. But we also
[02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:42.660]  have to get a handle on this financial thing because clearly the Federal Reserve is trying
[02:02:42.660 --> 02:02:49.620]  now to create a recession so that Trump will not get reelected. So here we have these traders
[02:02:49.620 --> 02:02:56.620]  trying to drag down the economy with this myth that all the economy is overheating. BS
[02:02:56.620 --> 02:02:59.540]  is growing. It's growing. It's succeeding like crazy.
[02:02:59.540 --> 02:03:02.780]  Well, let's be clear because you're an awesome call. Walt, you're making great points. Your
[02:03:02.780 --> 02:03:08.780]  phone's crystal clear. I love you. China's had 10% growth rates for 20, 30 years. Oh,
[02:03:08.780 --> 02:03:14.100]  that's all fine. We start getting a 4.5. Oh my gosh, it's overheating because again, exactly,
[02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:20.420]  they want to kill the American dream. That's their plan. That's their program and expanding
[02:03:20.420 --> 02:03:25.020]  on the Federal Reserve and what it's done. And then now how they spin this whole thing
[02:03:25.020 --> 02:03:28.700]  that, oh, it's above the law. We can't do anything about it. And, oh, big tech, it's
[02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:32.500]  private companies. It'd be the same thing if they broke in on your phone call if you
[02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:38.820]  were saying something that the company didn't like. And they said, let's say, Ma Bell 30
[02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:42.540]  years ago before it got broken up or when it got broken up, imagine Ma Bell said, well,
[02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:46.420]  we're a private company, so we can control what you say in private conversations. No,
[02:03:46.420 --> 02:03:52.060]  that's prior restraint. And we have the law, Section 230 of the Telecommunications Act.
[02:03:52.060 --> 02:03:57.100]  So they're violating the damn law, playing dumb like the public doesn't know. So it's
[02:03:57.100 --> 02:04:01.380]  up to us to inform Congress that we do know because that's what's really scary. The Republicans
[02:04:01.380 --> 02:04:08.380]  know what's going on here. Well, maybe the people in Congress could dig down deep inside
[02:04:08.380 --> 02:04:13.420]  their soul and discover a little patriotism and try to do something for the country and
[02:04:13.420 --> 02:04:19.220]  something for the future of humanity. Maybe they could try to enact legislation beginning
[02:04:19.220 --> 02:04:24.500]  in the House that would break up these big companies or limit their ability to control
[02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:29.660]  content. And maybe we could do something about the currency, too, and give that power back
[02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:34.060]  to the people under their representatives. How can they have all this power? Why have
[02:04:34.060 --> 02:04:39.500]  we surrendered these powers? The people need to wake up and assert themselves. What can
[02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:43.620]  we do to wake the people up, Alex? What you're doing right now, brother, and what you just
[02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:48.980]  said is absolutely 100% over the target. It's horrifying how they got control of our banking
[02:04:48.980 --> 02:04:53.420]  and our currency in 1913. And now with big tech, it's our communications. They go, oh,
[02:04:53.420 --> 02:04:56.900]  it's okay, it's private.
[02:04:56.900 --> 02:05:02.020]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found
[02:05:02.020 --> 02:05:06.940]  here in Leilani Estates. But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and we
[02:05:06.940 --> 02:05:13.780]  need to be concerned about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:18.980]  And acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed
[02:05:18.980 --> 02:05:25.260]  a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH. What we learned was that there was
[02:05:25.260 --> 02:05:30.780]  in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next, we tested
[02:05:30.780 --> 02:05:35.860]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter. And not only were the heavy metal levels within
[02:05:35.860 --> 02:05:42.660]  safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter
[02:05:42.660 --> 02:05:48.300]  on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water. So what we've learned is that volcanic ash
[02:05:48.300 --> 02:05:53.740]  and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply. But more importantly, a good water
[02:05:53.740 --> 02:05:56.340]  filtration system will purify it.
[02:05:56.340 --> 02:06:13.700]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[02:06:13.700 --> 02:06:30.180]  the Info War.
[02:06:30.180 --> 02:06:56.180]  I get really pissed being informed and knowing what's going on.
[02:07:00.580 --> 02:07:04.140]  I don't get excited when the mainstream news comes out political and goes, okay, there
[02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:09.260]  are giant no go zones all over Europe and none of the Muslims have jobs and everything's
[02:07:09.260 --> 02:07:14.180]  collapsing. I just say, God almighty, why couldn't we have stopped this earlier? The incredible
[02:07:14.180 --> 02:07:33.140]  hope Lou Ferrigno hospitalized after pneumonia vaccine goes wrong, almost died. Oh my goodness.
[02:07:33.140 --> 02:07:39.660]  It just never ends. Meanwhile, there's some good news, though. Republicans announced last
[02:07:39.660 --> 02:07:44.740]  week, but it's finally hit the news today that they're going to go ahead with hearings
[02:07:44.740 --> 02:07:52.780]  in this lame duck session of Congress, better late than never with whistleblowers testifying
[02:07:52.780 --> 02:07:57.100]  live on television about the paper play and the criminal activities in the billions by
[02:07:57.100 --> 02:07:59.940]  the Clintons.
[02:07:59.940 --> 02:08:04.420]  Fox News Republicans examine accusations of pay to play at Clinton Foundation amid plunge
[02:08:04.420 --> 02:08:12.140]  in donations. It's plunged over 90% since they're out of office. Meanwhile, Yellow Vest
[02:08:12.140 --> 02:08:19.100]  bringing Central London to a standstill. Unity News Network reports big demonstrations with
[02:08:19.100 --> 02:08:23.880]  the Yellow Vest blocking roads, protest, the fake Brexit deal that would hand over total
[02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:32.580]  sovereignty of England to the EU dictatorship. So that stuff is spreading very, very exciting
[02:08:32.580 --> 02:08:37.060]  to see that happening. And France is set to see the fifth weekend of demonstrations as
[02:08:37.060 --> 02:08:41.980]  well as they were going to have the no confidence vote on Macron today, but they actually didn't
[02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:42.980]  have it.
[02:08:42.980 --> 02:08:47.460]  Similar to recent May, but they're saying both those guys are very close to being removed
[02:08:47.460 --> 02:08:53.180]  from office. So we're on the march. The empire is on the run. Globalism, as soon as we defined
[02:08:53.180 --> 02:09:01.540]  it, unelected corporations running our countries who say they want us poor to control us. Man,
[02:09:01.540 --> 02:09:06.060]  it's like selling people gasoline in the middle of a fire, dump gasoline on your head. I'd
[02:09:06.060 --> 02:09:11.660]  rather sell it with snow cones to, you know, folks in the Sahara. That's what freedom is
[02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:17.460]  versus socialism. So we're in a really crazy place right now. Let's go back to your calls.
[02:09:17.460 --> 02:09:23.660]  Wild man, wild man in the state of Texas. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[02:09:23.660 --> 02:09:27.060]  God bless you, Alex. Glad to take. Thanks for taking my call.
[02:09:27.060 --> 02:09:28.060]  Thanks for calling.
[02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:31.660]  I haven't talked to you in a while. Last time I called in, it's been a couple of years.
[02:09:31.660 --> 02:09:35.460]  A couple of years. Posh Plumlee was almost talking about the traffic, the traffic across
[02:09:35.460 --> 02:09:41.940]  the border, training ISIS over there and all that. I called you. I found you due to research
[02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:50.260]  of my late wife's illness and finding out about vaccines and all the stuff. This was
[02:09:50.260 --> 02:09:57.020]  back in 2013. She passed away from ALS is what they named it. And in my research, I found
[02:09:57.020 --> 02:10:05.260]  out, you know, she, her dad had, uh, he was in Vietnam and he ended up passing away from
[02:10:05.260 --> 02:10:11.300]  like nine strokes that he had. And she was, she had four sisters and she was the only
[02:10:11.300 --> 02:10:16.980]  one that went over there to Vietnam with him. And she had to take the same, uh, vaccines
[02:10:16.980 --> 02:10:20.100]  that the soldiers had to when she went over to South Korea.
[02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:21.100]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:10:21.100 --> 02:10:24.820]  And then when, and when she got that, that was a soft kill program is what I found out
[02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:30.020]  research. And she ended up getting this ALS at 53. She passed away from,
[02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:35.460]  well, let's explain. They don't want a bunch of battle hardened soldiers back in the country
[02:10:35.460 --> 02:10:40.420]  who are patriots. So you use them in a war, but after a war, what do you do? You spike
[02:10:40.420 --> 02:10:45.300]  a cannon, you pull the engine out of the helicopter when you put it at the park. You want to use
[02:10:45.300 --> 02:10:51.220]  the cannon, the artillery or the tank or the helicopter to get kids to join. This is the
[02:10:51.220 --> 02:10:55.900]  technocrats on top, but you don't want that tank or that helicopter or that howitzer to
[02:10:55.900 --> 02:11:00.820]  actually work. And so yes, and I know so many soldiers, so many people that have been in
[02:11:00.820 --> 02:11:06.380]  every branch of the services, you name it, from the lowest level cooks to the most secret,
[02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:11.140]  you know, teams. And it's well known that some officers were like, we're not taking
[02:11:11.140 --> 02:11:16.060]  this and I'm not either throw it away. We're going to lie and put in the forms we did to
[02:11:16.060 --> 02:11:20.100]  those that would make them do it, but they would be routinely in formations. And this
[02:11:20.100 --> 02:11:26.740]  has come out in the news. Have people die like a platoon get shots in one person dies
[02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:31.060]  tenor in the hospital, because they aren't just getting the regular vaccines. They're
[02:11:31.060 --> 02:11:36.020]  getting tested on. And so yeah, you join the military. It's not that our military is bad.
[02:11:36.020 --> 02:11:40.220]  It's not that America is bad. The criminals have used the secrecy of our military. They've
[02:11:40.220 --> 02:11:45.780]  used the stoicism of our military as a place to test on people. And you're absolutely right.
[02:11:45.780 --> 02:11:54.100]  A lot of the children and families of service people end up getting those military shots.
[02:11:54.100 --> 02:12:00.220]  And you know, your wife got to live, I guess, a while, you know, 40 years or so. A lot of
[02:12:00.220 --> 02:12:05.820]  people get killed right on the spot. And again, it's all about how to cover it up. It's all
[02:12:05.820 --> 02:12:10.540]  a big test. And again, the average person, the military is not involved. This is all
[02:12:10.540 --> 02:12:16.860]  a giant technocracy program. And she, you know, I took care of her here in the house
[02:12:16.860 --> 02:12:21.180]  because she passed away. I wouldn't put her in a home. And finding out all this, I found
[02:12:21.180 --> 02:12:25.140]  out lives of these, you know, was created on that island out. So off the island out there
[02:12:25.140 --> 02:12:32.140]  that test. Yes, you know, it's it's tick carried weaponized. Exactly. That the ticks come over
[02:12:32.140 --> 02:12:35.900]  on the fowl that was on the deer that they were testing that on. And it came over here
[02:12:35.900 --> 02:12:41.060]  and spread. And this is all how I found all this out was, and then I found you searching
[02:12:41.060 --> 02:12:46.420]  on researching all this. And then, you know, you're talking about your last caller talking
[02:12:46.420 --> 02:12:49.820]  about, you know, jobs going overseas and you're talking about it all the time and then Trump
[02:12:49.820 --> 02:12:54.900]  trying to get it all back. I was part of that. I got laid off in 1981 from the steel mill
[02:12:54.900 --> 02:12:59.500]  in Pueblo, Colorado. See, that's not steel. There was 7,000 men working in that steel
[02:12:59.500 --> 02:13:05.140]  mill when I was there. And they laid off 2,500 of us for the first whack when they got, when
[02:13:05.140 --> 02:13:11.100]  they started shutting all this steel mills down due to foreign steel. And then as a result
[02:13:11.100 --> 02:13:16.780]  of that, we started getting this crappy steel over here. And it was the rails for the railroad
[02:13:16.780 --> 02:13:21.260]  was crumbling apart and stuff. So they decided to open that part of the mill back up and
[02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:25.340]  leave it going. But you get flat iron and all that kind of stuff come in with steel
[02:13:25.340 --> 02:13:28.580]  forks and knives in this flat sheet metal.
[02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:33.580]  Absolutely. It's all a big giant scam. China and all of them just sell us pure crap, just
[02:13:33.580 --> 02:13:39.620]  like China executes you if you even have opiates, because that's how the British East India
[02:13:39.620 --> 02:13:44.700]  Company took control of China was shipping those drugs in. But they ship all this synthetic
[02:13:44.700 --> 02:13:52.140]  heroin over here in massive amounts, literally as a chemical weapon against us. But you know,
[02:13:52.140 --> 02:13:56.860]  you lost your wife. I think you're right. Clearly the vaccines. They told my grandmother
[02:13:56.860 --> 02:14:00.140]  that she got polio from the vaccine.
[02:14:00.140 --> 02:14:05.060]  Lou Ferrigno just almost got killed by a vaccine. And it's just crazy how we're all just kind
[02:14:05.060 --> 02:14:08.420]  of calm about it. You know, I'm not saying you're bad or I'm bad or anybody's bad. I'm
[02:14:08.420 --> 02:14:13.580]  just saying, look at how we just just just work. We're conservatives or we're Christians
[02:14:13.580 --> 02:14:17.580]  and we just kind of, well, that's the way it is. Who's behind this because they know
[02:14:17.580 --> 02:14:21.820]  what they're doing. They admit in their white papers, they're doing this. Well, how about
[02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:27.740]  we start researching the people that are involved in this and who they are and making a list
[02:14:27.740 --> 02:14:32.500]  and checking it twice show that as they try to build the collapse of civilization to use
[02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:37.900]  their Islamic terror rings or whatever, just like the yellow vest, there's a two way street
[02:14:37.900 --> 02:14:44.300]  there. But I'm not calling for any offensive operations at this time. And I'll never sit
[02:14:44.300 --> 02:14:47.780]  here and try to command people or tell them the time or place. Everybody's got it in their
[02:14:47.780 --> 02:14:53.460]  own gut. But I'm telling you, these eugenicists, these mad scientists, they want to hide behind
[02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:59.100]  the politicians and carry all this stuff out. I'm telling you, I'm telling you, they need
[02:14:59.100 --> 02:15:03.860]  to be exposed. They need to be looked at. They need to be stood up against because another
[02:15:03.860 --> 02:15:07.500]  reason we're under attack is we expose the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. But wild
[02:15:07.500 --> 02:15:13.460]  man, God bless you. And I appreciate you calling. Great call. So many callers. So little time
[02:15:13.460 --> 02:15:18.900]  here. We got Matt in Ohio and Kathleen and a bunch of others and Sean. We'll go to break

[02:17:57.180 --> 02:18:01.460]  I don't have to tell our listeners and viewers how important M4 Wars is in the fight against
[02:18:01.460 --> 02:18:06.580]  the anti-human globalist. So let's say it's short and sweet. We are your support now more
[02:18:06.580 --> 02:18:10.420]  than ever. You've come through a thousand times since I'm not bitching at you. I'm just
[02:18:10.420 --> 02:18:14.860]  simply telling you, we are in the thick of the battle now. The attacks on M4 Wars have
[02:18:14.860 --> 02:18:20.060]  become absolutely exponential and down the road we probably will get destroyed. But I
[02:18:20.060 --> 02:18:24.180]  know and God has really put it on my heart that we've got to maintain the fight as hard
[02:18:24.180 --> 02:18:29.700]  as possible and go through as much as we can to be an example to others and carry out critical
[02:18:29.700 --> 02:18:34.220]  operations ahead of whatever happens. But I want to be strong in this fight. I need
[02:18:34.220 --> 02:18:38.220]  to be provisioned and I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros and the Rothschilds
[02:18:38.220 --> 02:18:41.940]  and all these devil worshipers. But I need your prayers. I need you to spread the articles
[02:18:41.940 --> 02:18:45.940]  and videos. I need you to give us financial support right now. We make it easy. Do your
[02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:51.260]  Christmas shopping with us, not with the globalists and not with Bezos and Amazon and you'll help
[02:18:51.260 --> 02:18:55.940]  provision us. We've got a bunch of huge deals at M4Wars.com. So please take action right
[02:18:55.940 --> 02:19:01.300]  now. M4 Wars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack
[02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:07.020]  on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing. We've been proven dead on. You've
[02:19:07.020 --> 02:19:11.820]  been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this project. You've been the men and women
[02:19:11.820 --> 02:19:17.380]  of the arena and I really do thank you and salute you. All words are not enough. Think
[02:19:17.380 --> 02:19:22.740]  about all the different systems, all the different political ideologies that you have been on
[02:19:22.740 --> 02:19:27.900]  target, promoting Americana and Renaissance and open free society against the globalists
[02:19:27.900 --> 02:19:31.940]  and the dominant world force. They've created a tower of babel with a bunch of people that
[02:19:31.940 --> 02:19:36.460]  can't communicate with each other. But we have cut right to the chase. Human liberty,
[02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:40.980]  a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future. And that's why I want to thank you
[02:19:40.980 --> 02:19:46.220]  all and ask you now more than ever to remember that M4Wars really is your baby. I am in your

[02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:17.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:17.180 --> 02:20:38.260]  You know, I tend to get lost and I don't want to talk about myself. I'm not doing that.
[02:20:38.260 --> 02:20:46.180]  I want you to know why I hate myself sometimes. Because I listen to a rebroadcast sometimes.
[02:20:46.180 --> 02:20:52.700]  And I think I was about to talk about one subject and then I go off on another. But
[02:20:52.700 --> 02:21:00.500]  here's why. I'm not lying. So then when I pull up data, I see a whole bunch of data
[02:21:00.500 --> 02:21:05.020]  and then I'll tend to like not go in the direction I wanted to. I'll just start talking about
[02:21:05.020 --> 02:21:11.220]  what I know. And I think most of you get that, but it's like yesterday I talked about the
[02:21:11.220 --> 02:21:16.500]  Seventh Day Adventists and how they allowed themselves to be tested on and some died in
[02:21:16.500 --> 02:21:20.940]  secret experiments because they thought that was Christlike. And they were conscientious
[02:21:20.940 --> 02:21:25.300]  objectors that didn't want to kill people in war. And then I went on to say, but some
[02:21:25.300 --> 02:21:31.660]  of them, you know, obviously were used as assassins. And I heard that later and I'm like, well,
[02:21:31.660 --> 02:21:37.900]  that's not entirely accurate. People recruited out of those programs did it. But you could
[02:21:37.900 --> 02:21:42.900]  say that that was someone not following the Seventh Day Adventist religion. So then and
[02:21:42.900 --> 02:21:45.780]  I'm not a Seventh Day Adventist. I just happen to know about it and it's historical and I've
[02:21:45.780 --> 02:21:50.700]  read about it. And I grew up in Dallas or some inside baseball with a Seventh Day Adventist
[02:21:50.700 --> 02:21:56.660]  who've definitely got their crap together. I don't know if any other people think Jews
[02:21:56.660 --> 02:22:01.620]  are like per capita are really active and rich and powerful and smart. Seventh Day Adventists
[02:22:01.620 --> 02:22:08.580]  are like, jump a jacksman. They're just running around involved in everything. And but but
[02:22:08.580 --> 02:22:12.660]  I'm digressing. The point is, I want to say one thing on air and I ended up saying another
[02:22:12.660 --> 02:22:15.860]  thing on there. So I'm just going to go back to your calls, but I want to say this point
[02:22:15.860 --> 02:22:25.500]  because it's so important. I talked about Plato, not Plato, Plato, the most famous progenitor,
[02:22:25.500 --> 02:22:34.220]  the fount, the the King Daddy, the great granddaddy of the system of philosophy that we get from
[02:22:34.220 --> 02:22:39.620]  the groups. And man, you read his four or five books and I've read most of it. I skipped
[02:22:39.620 --> 02:22:48.420]  past some of it by God, it's heavy stuff. And you know the mindset of the globalist.
[02:22:48.420 --> 02:22:58.940]  And I want to be more clear on that. You then read something like Sir Thomas Malthus three
[02:22:58.940 --> 02:23:05.740]  hundred and fifty years ago. And then you're like, Oh, it's the same thing. It's a school
[02:23:05.740 --> 02:23:14.420]  of thought. You wonder like, how do they put cancer viruses and vaccines? Why would they
[02:23:14.420 --> 02:23:18.520]  have compartmentalization? Why would they do all this horrible stuff? You got to understand
[02:23:18.520 --> 02:23:25.780]  Plato said this should be done two thousand three hundred years ago. And then Malthus
[02:23:25.780 --> 02:23:35.100]  said it. You heard of Malthusianism. He said the health departments should be set up to
[02:23:35.100 --> 02:23:39.380]  crowd poor people in together and cut their food off and starve them to death and then
[02:23:39.380 --> 02:23:44.560]  give them smallpox blankets. What you just think they thought of that in the French
[02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:52.620]  and Indian war a hundred years later in Canada and the U. S. No. See, once you know the school
[02:23:52.620 --> 02:24:01.740]  of thought, now you know why Hitler did it. Now you know why that because they were trained
[02:24:01.740 --> 02:24:14.660]  in it. Now it depends on how you apply that school of thought. There's the Renaissance
[02:24:14.660 --> 02:24:20.660]  school of thought. Empower the individual, build humanity, give as much independence
[02:24:20.660 --> 02:24:25.100]  to individuals as you can. That makes them great. The Malthusians come in, the eugenics
[02:24:25.100 --> 02:24:32.100]  come in, the Platoites come in and they go, oh, we got to be nice to everyone, take control
[02:24:32.100 --> 02:24:36.020]  of them. That's actually a form of domination to dumb them down and make sure they don't
[02:24:36.020 --> 02:24:43.060]  compete with you. And under social Darwinism, which is just, again, Malthusianism or Plato,
[02:24:43.060 --> 02:24:48.220]  if you can beat somebody no matter how you do it, dirty, whatever, it means you're dominant,
[02:24:48.220 --> 02:24:55.220]  social Darwinism, you're in charge and you deserve to be empowered. So if they can lie
[02:24:55.220 --> 02:24:59.900]  to us and sell us AI and break up our families and get our kids on smartphones and have them
[02:24:59.900 --> 02:25:03.860]  all brainwashed when none of the Google or Facebook or Apple people let their kids get
[02:25:03.860 --> 02:25:11.820]  near them, you deserve to die. You're chained up in Plato's cave while they project a movie
[02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:18.860]  screen. He invented the first movie screen. Plato, the trick was they were already doing
[02:25:18.860 --> 02:25:24.180]  it in theater back then, is that you'd have a big fire and behind it you'd have brass
[02:25:24.180 --> 02:25:32.900]  plates, mirrors, primitive metal mirrors that would push the firelight onto the wall. And
[02:25:32.900 --> 02:25:40.780]  people would sit in front of that, not looking at the fire, and people would basically, you
[02:25:40.780 --> 02:25:44.140]  like to do with your kids in front of a projector or a light where you do like dinosaurs fighting
[02:25:44.140 --> 02:25:48.980]  or whatever. And they would bring in puppets and things and do puppet shows. The old Greek
[02:25:48.980 --> 02:25:55.300]  puppet shows weren't people with puppets. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's puppets projected
[02:25:55.300 --> 02:26:01.460]  through light onto a screen, the movie theater. And he said the people that are most into
[02:26:01.460 --> 02:26:17.900]  that are mesmerized are hypnotized. And he said that is a allegory for how we, the illuminated,
[02:26:17.900 --> 02:26:24.100]  this is their own contemporary system, not a Jewish cosmology of Lucifer, but still Lucifer
[02:26:24.100 --> 02:26:31.380]  meaning light. We, those of light, are the fire. And while we live up on the surface,
[02:26:31.380 --> 02:26:36.020]  they're down there with our reflected light with what we decide to show them and we govern
[02:26:36.020 --> 02:26:45.420]  their entire future. And what did he call for? Everything we now live under. He envisioned
[02:26:45.420 --> 02:26:53.140]  everything. He said we'll find the secrets of what makes good breathing, but the process
[02:26:53.140 --> 02:26:57.740]  will have to exterminate the general public. So we'll have to use games, entertainment
[02:26:57.740 --> 02:27:05.220]  in the process to further dumb them down. And then he discussed the different processes
[02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:09.780]  to carry it out. And let me tell you, you're living in Plato's world. It's when I write
[02:27:09.780 --> 02:27:21.500]  a book called It's Plato's Planet. Plato. Plato. Plato. Plato. You can sit here and look at
[02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:26.900]  any of this other stuff. It'll never make sense until you read 800 page books written
[02:27:26.900 --> 02:27:33.260]  by that guy and you're like, Oh my goodness, this guy, everything he wrote. Well, what
[02:27:33.260 --> 02:27:39.020]  there weren't many books going back over the thousands of years, but Plato's books survived.
[02:27:39.020 --> 02:27:45.220]  And whether it was in Japan 500 years ago or China 500 years ago or Tsarist Russia 500
[02:27:45.220 --> 02:27:50.740]  years ago or Imperial England 500 years ago or Imperial Spain or Imperial Portugal or
[02:27:50.740 --> 02:27:58.020]  the Dutch colonies, everyone read it. And it's the system. And we live under this system.
[02:27:58.020 --> 02:28:00.980]  And that's why the globalists have come to me off record and sometimes on record. So
[02:28:00.980 --> 02:28:07.860]  I've said some of the names and said, listen, you get all this, you need to come join us.
[02:28:07.860 --> 02:28:11.620]  And these are good looking people dressed perfectly super nice. They seem genuine. They
[02:28:11.620 --> 02:28:20.020]  don't even seem evil. Their minions are. But they have decided that you're scum. Yeah,
[02:28:20.020 --> 02:28:29.380]  there's Galton and their quarterback in the whole show. And so you have to understand
[02:28:29.380 --> 02:28:36.460]  what you're hearing here is not my opinion. This is what the people that built the whole
[02:28:36.460 --> 02:28:46.300]  future of the world had planned. But about 300 years after Plato, other people came along
[02:28:46.300 --> 02:28:50.900]  and had visions of how to stop it. Because God's not going to leave us in a situation
[02:28:50.900 --> 02:28:58.940]  like this one manual to stop it. Marijuana has unleashed a green gold rush across our
[02:28:58.940 --> 02:29:05.140]  nation. It's creating $10.8 billion in new wealth a year. And every day it's transforming
[02:29:05.140 --> 02:29:10.100]  more and more Americans into millionaires. In an historic event, former Speaker of the
[02:29:10.100 --> 02:29:15.820]  House John Boehner reveals how you could become one of them. Join him online for the American

[02:29:54.500 --> 02:30:00.980]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[02:30:00.980 --> 02:30:06.300]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk. Believe me, I know.
[02:30:06.300 --> 02:30:11.180]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.

[02:30:17.140 --> 02:30:21.420]  I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals and
[02:30:21.420 --> 02:30:25.660]  the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time
[02:30:25.660 --> 02:30:31.300]  and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive, to get to
[02:30:31.300 --> 02:30:38.380]  the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health. So go to InfowarsStore.com

[02:33:40.140 --> 02:33:49.980]  So, top UK official admits that bringing in more illegal aliens drives down wages. That's
[02:33:49.980 --> 02:33:56.860]  on NewsWars.com. Endless supply of cheap labor damages native population and doesn't help
[02:33:56.860 --> 02:34:06.460]  the third world population. But we know that. It helps the globalists who don't want a vibrant
[02:34:06.460 --> 02:34:16.220]  middle class that politically always demands freedom and a stairway to the poor. The globalist
[02:34:16.220 --> 02:34:22.780]  want a post-industrial world for all of us. But then you see Bernie Sanders and Alexandra
[02:34:22.780 --> 02:34:30.620]  Cortez. Bernie Sanders is evil. He knows what he's doing. It's Cortez. It's just unbelievable
[02:34:30.620 --> 02:34:41.180]  stupid. And you notice she's up there saying, why are you afraid of socialism? And the
[02:34:41.180 --> 02:34:49.180]  main is because socialists eat their dogs. We walk them. Capitalists walk them. But Sanders,
[02:34:49.180 --> 02:34:57.620]  he's a whole another kettle of fish. And they're out there running their mouths constantly
[02:34:57.620 --> 02:35:02.460]  about how great socialism is and how great open borders are. And basically, they cut
[02:35:02.460 --> 02:35:11.540]  your legs off. Sanders is always like, we need a minimum wage of $15. But he doesn't
[02:35:11.540 --> 02:35:15.500]  tell you because most people don't run a business that you then got to pay about $7, $8, $9,
[02:35:15.500 --> 02:35:21.860]  $10 and other taxes and regulations and stuff on that employee. So a $15 employee is about
[02:35:21.860 --> 02:35:29.220]  a $23 employee in Texas. It's higher in some states. Yeah, you pay somebody $15 an hour,
[02:35:29.220 --> 02:35:35.260]  it's $23. I pay crew members $30, $40 an hour on average. I'm paying like $50 an hour. That's
[02:35:35.260 --> 02:35:40.100]  what people don't see. So what you do is you don't open. You don't hire people. The owner
[02:35:40.100 --> 02:35:46.980]  works all the time in his own hamburger place because he can't afford the three or four
[02:35:46.980 --> 02:35:51.060]  jerk-offs that are all going to screw around and pick boogers and play video games the
[02:35:51.060 --> 02:35:55.060]  whole time when he could do the job of three people and actually pay for his daughter's
[02:35:55.060 --> 02:36:04.780]  tuition. But the average person, the average 16-year-old, zit-faced person looks up and
[02:36:04.780 --> 02:36:09.300]  goes, Bernie Sanders wants to give me free healthcare and free college. And he says,
[02:36:09.300 --> 02:36:15.260]  I need $15, but this local diner is only going to pay me $9. Yeah, kid, because after all
[02:36:15.260 --> 02:36:20.660]  the taxes and crap, you're getting paid $15. But see, kid, you'll never get the job now
[02:36:20.660 --> 02:36:26.780]  because there isn't going to be one there for you. So rising economy raises wages regardless.
[02:36:26.780 --> 02:36:32.260]  That's the healthy way. But instead, oh, Bernie Sanders, he's going to get you $15 an hour.
[02:36:32.260 --> 02:36:44.100]  It's just the job then won't exist, sonny boy. All right, I'm going to do your calls.
[02:36:44.100 --> 02:36:49.660]  I apologize. I'm out of control. Let's talk to Kathleen in California. We'll go to Sean
[02:36:49.660 --> 02:36:51.660]  and Ethan and others. Kathleen, thanks for holding.
[02:36:51.660 --> 02:36:57.740]  Oh, thank you. This is my first time speaking with you. I've been trying to reach you before
[02:36:57.740 --> 02:37:04.980]  because I have so much to say and I understand why you jump around because publics basically,
[02:37:04.980 --> 02:37:14.860]  you know, overwhelmed with the amount of destruction and with the financial terrorism, vaccines,
[02:37:14.860 --> 02:37:21.740]  the educational system, and, you know, getting people arguing and conflicting with each other
[02:37:21.740 --> 02:37:30.340]  while these guys are behind the scenes or doing all these hidden covert things against
[02:37:30.340 --> 02:37:37.500]  us. And so I understand, you know, with the wavelengths, the electromagnetic fields and
[02:37:37.500 --> 02:37:46.900]  the matrix so that they can implant us with ideas and the TV, people watch TV, you're
[02:37:46.900 --> 02:37:53.220]  hypnotized by it, you know, everything you say. I've been saying things for years. I'm
[02:37:53.220 --> 02:37:59.740]  very, I'm an herbal nutritionist and have created many products and your products are
[02:37:59.740 --> 02:38:06.740]  absolutely fantastic. I recommend them to my clients. I have them order them. I order
[02:38:06.740 --> 02:38:08.540]  lots of products from you.
[02:38:08.540 --> 02:38:13.180]  Well, ma'am, I mean, I really appreciate you saying that. But obviously, I'm not a sociopath.
[02:38:13.180 --> 02:38:18.060]  But if I was, I want to put out the best products anyway, so people want to reorder them. But
[02:38:18.060 --> 02:38:22.980]  if you're a big target like I am, we better have clean, good products. But my philosophy
[02:38:22.980 --> 02:38:26.500]  is treat people like I want to be treated. So thank you for the support. But you're absolutely
[02:38:26.500 --> 02:38:31.540]  right. It's all admitted that they've tested the flicker rates, all the systems to mesmerize
[02:38:31.540 --> 02:38:36.300]  people. But I found that if you're conscious and awake, and that if you know about the
[02:38:36.300 --> 02:38:40.180]  scam, the programming doesn't work against you. I think it irritates you. I know it
[02:38:40.180 --> 02:38:45.020]  does me. But I don't think the programming works once you're aware of it. You see what
[02:38:45.020 --> 02:38:46.020]  I'm saying?
[02:38:46.020 --> 02:38:53.460]  Oh, absolutely. And I think the basic on this whole thing is education, people understanding
[02:38:53.460 --> 02:39:00.540]  the words. And that's where they've really, I think that really screwed the students and
[02:39:00.540 --> 02:39:09.500]  the people is the amount of, on different subjects, the nomenclature, understanding the language
[02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:18.220]  itself. And when you pass things you don't understand, you physiologically, you mentally
[02:39:18.220 --> 02:39:26.620]  go blank. You can't comprehend. And if that technology is known, you can control a public
[02:39:26.620 --> 02:39:36.100]  with just that alone. And then with the vaccinations and the flu shots, which to me are vaccinations.
[02:39:36.100 --> 02:39:43.340]  And I've been saying for years to my clients and friends, do not get vaccinated. That stuff
[02:39:43.340 --> 02:39:48.700]  is horrible. They're actually creating the very problem. And I know in the government's
[02:39:48.700 --> 02:39:55.100]  records, it even showed like when they were giving the live polio vaccination, the smallpox,
[02:39:55.100 --> 02:40:00.940]  which was outlined in the outlaws in the 60s. But when they were giving the shots, the actual
[02:40:00.940 --> 02:40:03.580]  disease came back and increased.
[02:40:03.580 --> 02:40:07.980]  Oh, I know. I have the newspaper articles when it happened. Listen, my grandmother was
[02:40:07.980 --> 02:40:13.580]  awesome lady. I mean, she was a beauty queen, super Christian, loving lady. And you know,
[02:40:13.580 --> 02:40:17.380]  she had two children, my grandfather, and then it just devastated their lives. She almost
[02:40:17.380 --> 02:40:22.700]  died. And the doctors told her the vaccine gave it to you, but it's for the greater good,
[02:40:22.700 --> 02:40:30.340]  and it's just so sick that when we've experienced this, we've been through this personally.
[02:40:30.340 --> 02:40:33.460]  People in this office, I know two people that work here, I won't say their names, had their
[02:40:33.460 --> 02:40:39.380]  children die from vaccines. You know, Lou Ferrigno, they said, Oh, you got real sick and swole
[02:40:39.380 --> 02:40:46.620]  up and couldn't walk. Someone didn't clean the spot they injected it. No, Lou. No, Lou.
[02:40:46.620 --> 02:40:52.940]  That's not what happened, buddy boy. Read the insert. And Lou will say, I can't believe
[02:40:52.940 --> 02:40:58.980]  it. It says it can give you Guillain-Barre. I was sore and couldn't walk and they told
[02:40:58.980 --> 02:41:04.820]  me it was good. But I'm making fun of his voice. That's how he talks. And you know, just in
[02:41:04.820 --> 02:41:09.860]  the final equation, stop being so trusting Lou, because you're a big, gentle giant. They
[02:41:09.860 --> 02:41:13.820]  come from a good family, good people, a lot of people that know Lou Ferrigno's family.
[02:41:13.820 --> 02:41:17.380]  Just because you're a nice guy, doesn't mean people outside your head are nice, buddy.
[02:41:17.380 --> 02:41:24.780]  Grow up before you're dead. God bless you, Kathleen. I appreciate your call. Oh, God.
[02:41:24.780 --> 02:41:28.660]  You know, I wanted to play this Mark Dice piece about the attack on the First Amendment and
[02:41:28.660 --> 02:41:33.340]  also Tucker Carlson, but also want to go to your phone calls. And we've got Matt Bracken
[02:41:33.340 --> 02:41:38.300]  coming up. So let's do this. Call Matt Bracken. He loves calls, but see if he wants these
[02:41:38.300 --> 02:41:41.300]  calls. If he doesn't, I'm going to have to look where everybody go. It's our fault. We
[02:41:41.300 --> 02:41:44.580]  get 20 phone lines, but I appreciate everybody calling. So just stay on hold. We'll find
[02:41:44.580 --> 02:41:48.380]  out if Matt's going to want to talk to you. So he's really smart guy on all these topics
[02:41:48.380 --> 02:41:57.820]  or if whatever needs to happen is going to happen. But I mean, I do care. I do feel and
[02:41:57.820 --> 02:42:03.500]  I don't say that some virtue signaling. I mean, I love people and I love the average
[02:42:03.500 --> 02:42:12.460]  person, but I also then feel very aggressive and very angry towards bad people. And I only
[02:42:12.460 --> 02:42:16.940]  tell you that because I know sometimes the show can be a train wreck, but I just, I thank
[02:42:16.940 --> 02:42:23.820]  God every morning that at least we have conscience, a connection to God, at least we have a soul.
[02:42:23.820 --> 02:42:26.780]  So I thank the crew for the great job they've done. Everybody else are so much more coming
[02:42:26.780 --> 02:42:31.180]  up with this Tucker Carlson piece, this Mark Dice piece. They're very powerful. And again,
[02:42:31.180 --> 02:42:36.260]  you've stood with us. You're so amazing. You humbled me listeners. All the calls today
[02:42:36.260 --> 02:42:42.900]  have been the best ever. You humbled me and you really make me very, very thankful to
[02:42:42.900 --> 02:42:46.900]  be alive and you give me hope. So I want to salute you and the crew and all the local
[02:42:46.900 --> 02:42:51.420]  radio stations and TV stations. If you're listening to local radio stations, spread
[02:42:51.420 --> 02:42:55.540]  the word about those stations and support them. Thank you.
[02:42:55.540 --> 02:43:01.380]  Global wars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on
[02:43:01.380 --> 02:43:05.820]  the family, the eugenics, operations, the whole thing. We've been proven dead on. You've
[02:43:05.820 --> 02:43:10.620]  been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this project. You've been the men and women
[02:43:10.620 --> 02:43:16.220]  of the arena and I really do thank you and salute you. All words are not enough. Think
[02:43:16.220 --> 02:43:21.060]  about of all the different systems of all the different political ideologies that you
[02:43:21.060 --> 02:43:25.820]  have been on target, promoting Americana and Renaissance and open free society against
[02:43:25.820 --> 02:43:30.340]  the globalist and the dominant world force. They've created a tower of babel with a bunch
[02:43:30.340 --> 02:43:34.540]  of people that can't communicate with each other, but we have cut right to the chase.
[02:43:34.540 --> 02:43:39.220]  Human liberty, a pro human future versus the globalist anti human future. And that's why
[02:43:39.220 --> 02:43:42.980]  I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember the info wars really
[02:43:42.980 --> 02:43:47.820]  is your baby. I am in your hands and we're under unprecedented attack and we just need
[02:43:47.820 --> 02:43:52.340]  you to go to info wars.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever
[02:43:52.340 --> 02:43:57.660]  and funding info war a true 360 win. In the last few months, info wars has been escalating
[02:43:57.660 --> 02:44:01.900]  our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best selling items. And then I came up
[02:44:01.900 --> 02:44:05.820]  with the idea last week. Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store wide 50 to
[02:44:05.820 --> 02:44:13.380]  75% off double patriot points. Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every
[02:44:13.380 --> 02:44:18.300]  order. Even if it's a tube of fluoride free colloidal silver iodine four to five superblue,
[02:44:18.300 --> 02:44:23.340]  you'll get a free gift of a best selling t shirt while supplies last. And what I mean
[02:44:23.340 --> 02:44:27.320]  by that is everyone will get a t shirt, but these are going to be selling out. So whatever
[02:44:27.320 --> 02:44:31.820]  you order that day, there'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[02:44:31.820 --> 02:44:35.300]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders. So in the next
[02:44:35.300 --> 02:44:41.380]  12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had. So this is a loss leader.
[02:44:41.380 --> 02:44:45.380]  We are losing money on this. This is our biggest sale ever. Get your free gift. You're free
[02:44:45.380 --> 02:44:50.540]  shipping everything and don't fight the crowds in four store.com in four's life.com or triple
[02:44:50.540 --> 02:44:54.220]  eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. God bless you and thank you for your
[02:44:54.220 --> 02:44:55.220]  support.
[02:44:55.220 --> 02:45:01.580]  In the last few months, you have seen info wars offer the biggest sales in our history.
[02:45:01.580 --> 02:45:04.820]  Now we've sold out of some of our best selling items, but we've still got most of our best
[02:45:04.820 --> 02:45:09.580]  selling items in. That's why I am extending the 12 days of Christmas for four more days
[02:45:09.580 --> 02:45:13.580]  because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able to ship to anybody in the continental
[02:45:13.580 --> 02:45:18.100]  United States before Christmas and info wars store.com. But get your orders in. Don't fight
[02:45:18.100 --> 02:45:24.580]  those crowds and support the info war. All the sales the last 12 days, 50 to 75% off
[02:45:24.580 --> 02:45:28.580]  is back free shipping is still there. Double Patriot points. And we have an even bigger
[02:45:28.580 --> 02:45:35.580]  sales on four new items, vitamin, mineral, fusion, micro ZX, the t shirts, all of it.
[02:45:35.580 --> 02:45:39.220]  Just go check out the sales. There's too many to break them all down. Get your orders in
[02:45:39.220 --> 02:45:43.700]  by the 19th. You're guaranteed to get it on or before Christmas and thank you again all
[02:45:43.700 --> 02:45:49.380]  for your support. We're extending the sale until the 19th, but info wars is in your hands.
[02:45:49.380 --> 02:45:52.780]  And again, whatever you do, just spread the word about info wars.com and we're going to
[02:45:52.780 --> 02:45:56.700]  beat the globals together. Thank you.
[02:45:56.700 --> 02:46:01.860]  Everybody knows that history documents it, but there is a cult in every culture and every
[02:46:01.860 --> 02:46:06.380]  system throughout history that wants to hurt children. They want to abort children. They
[02:46:06.380 --> 02:46:10.900]  want to disease children. They want to abuse children. They want to confuse children. They
[02:46:10.900 --> 02:46:16.020]  want their essence. They want their soul. They want their spirit. They want their power
[02:46:16.020 --> 02:46:21.140]  because they are our future. And this Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ, that ultimate
[02:46:21.140 --> 02:46:26.140]  sacrifice. It is about the West. It is about a human future and standing with each other
[02:46:26.140 --> 02:46:31.020]  and believing in a better future. That's want to thank you all for your support. But I want
[02:46:31.020 --> 02:46:35.020]  to ask you all to pray for your own family, to pray for America, to play for President
[02:46:35.020 --> 02:46:41.260]  Trump, to pray for info wars, and to remember that you have the power to change the world.
[02:46:41.260 --> 02:46:45.740]  You have the power to override the sensors. You have the power to stop the globals dead
[02:46:45.740 --> 02:46:50.100]  in their tracks. I know you've been taken action. I salute you, but just remember, I know
[02:46:50.100 --> 02:46:54.860]  you're humble, but just remember you hold the future of this planet and the universe
[02:46:54.860 --> 02:46:59.460]  in your hands.
[02:46:59.460 --> 02:47:11.460]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:11.460 --> 02:47:20.620]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:20.620 --> 02:47:24.500]  If you grew up in this country, you remember hearing of when you were a kid, this is a
[02:47:24.500 --> 02:47:30.340]  free country. The Constitution gives us freedom. And the first freedom, literally the first
[02:47:30.340 --> 02:47:35.020]  number in the Bill of Rights, is freedom of speech. And for generations that was unquestioned
[02:47:35.020 --> 02:47:40.020]  here, it was the most celebrated of our rights. But increasingly, it is seen by the people
[02:47:40.020 --> 02:47:45.980]  in charge as an annoying relic. Don't believe us? Try to say something unauthorized in your
[02:47:45.980 --> 02:47:51.900]  workplace or on campus or even on a street corner. Why have things changed? Well, because
[02:47:51.900 --> 02:47:57.100]  the attitudes of our leaders have changed. And we have a small clip that tells you a
[02:47:57.100 --> 02:48:01.180]  lot about what they really believe. This is California Congressman Ted Lu. And he's
[02:48:01.180 --> 02:48:08.020]  explaining in this clip that sadly, he's prevented from banning talk he doesn't like by a pesky
[02:48:08.020 --> 02:48:11.900]  legal antique called the Constitution. Watch this.
[02:48:11.900 --> 02:48:17.780]  I would love to be able to regulate the content of speech. The First Amendment prevents me
[02:48:17.780 --> 02:48:22.540]  from doing so. And that's simply a function of the First Amendment. But I think over the
[02:48:22.540 --> 02:48:29.700]  long run, it's better that government does not regulate the content of speech.
[02:48:29.700 --> 02:48:32.740]  The CNN anchor just sort of nods like, of course, we'd all like to regulate speech if
[02:48:32.740 --> 02:48:38.020]  we could. Over the long run, he says, it's better not to regulate speech. Does that sound
[02:48:38.020 --> 02:48:43.860]  like someone who is deeply committed to a free society and its benefits? Or is it simply
[02:48:43.860 --> 02:48:49.460]  a bully admitting that for now, the law won't let him do what he wants to do, which is control
[02:48:49.460 --> 02:48:51.980]  your mind? I think you know the answer.
[02:48:51.980 --> 02:48:56.900]  Well, the left increasingly is using big tech threats and public shaming to stamp out political
[02:48:56.900 --> 02:49:02.420]  views it doesn't like. They're also ruining actors and comedians and anyone else who dares
[02:49:02.420 --> 02:49:07.700]  stray from the script. But not everybody is so limited. We learned that today when one
[02:49:07.700 --> 02:49:12.820]  cable host used a slur to describe a member of the Trump administration.
[02:49:12.820 --> 02:49:19.420]  Why doesn't Mike Pompeo care right now? Are the pathetic deflections that we just heard
[02:49:19.420 --> 02:49:25.220]  when he appeared on Fox and Friends, is that a patriot speaking or a wannabe dictator's
[02:49:25.220 --> 02:49:32.300]  butt boy? Dead serious, I'm asking, are these the words of a patriot?
[02:49:32.300 --> 02:49:38.700]  So the anchor apologized for that remark. But the question is, will she be punished? And
[02:49:38.700 --> 02:49:42.260]  of course, needless to say, we don't think she should be punished. She was saying what
[02:49:42.260 --> 02:49:46.260]  she thinks or she misspoke. It happens to everybody. She shouldn't face sanction for
[02:49:46.260 --> 02:49:51.380]  that, but then neither should Kevin Hart. But the left now is a long history as the
[02:49:51.380 --> 02:49:56.500]  only faction enjoying impunity for what it says.
[02:49:56.500 --> 02:50:01.720]  You talk like a sign language gorilla who got hit in the head. In fact, the only thing
[02:50:01.720 --> 02:50:09.020]  your mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin's **** holster.
[02:50:09.020 --> 02:50:13.220]  You give him a damn robe and you let him do whatever the hell he wants. Because this
[02:50:13.220 --> 02:50:20.100]  right now, this is my audition for Mr. Trump's cablin. And also for our regional production
[02:50:20.100 --> 02:50:28.780]  of the Crucible. And let me tell you, Queen, I was good.
[02:50:28.780 --> 02:50:33.100]  Dave Rubin, a host of Rubin Report on YouTube, which Dallas everyone watching has watched
[02:50:33.100 --> 02:50:36.420]  because it's excellent. He joins us today. Dave, thanks a lot for coming on. So just
[02:50:36.420 --> 02:50:43.980]  to be totally clear, people are able to tell jokes that I don't like and often they do.
[02:50:43.980 --> 02:50:48.380]  What I find so interesting is at this moment of peak hysteria about speech where you're
[02:50:48.380 --> 02:50:52.620]  seeing normal, decent, totally non bigoted people destroyed and the rest of us are completely
[02:50:52.620 --> 02:50:57.820]  terrified and art and free expression is totally ground to a halt. Aesthetics are suffering.
[02:50:57.820 --> 02:51:02.580]  No one can be creative anymore. At that exact moment, the left still feels totally free
[02:51:02.580 --> 02:51:06.740]  to say things that they would classify if others said them as bigoted. What's going on?
[02:51:06.740 --> 02:51:11.900]  Well, you just nailed it right there. I mean, quite literally, the Oscars can't even figure
[02:51:11.900 --> 02:51:17.140]  out who to host the show anymore, either because they can't find anyone that's politically
[02:51:17.140 --> 02:51:21.860]  correct enough or that everyone that would like to do it is now afraid to do it because
[02:51:21.860 --> 02:51:27.580]  of the repercussions. But as for the clips that you just played, I mean, look, the simple
[02:51:27.580 --> 02:51:33.700]  truth of this is it's showing what the flaw of collectivism, which is basically the idea
[02:51:33.700 --> 02:51:38.140]  of judging people based on their immutable characteristics, why it is so terrible and
[02:51:38.140 --> 02:51:43.220]  why it has been embraced by the left, you know, you can't be for groups. It actually
[02:51:43.220 --> 02:51:47.060]  doesn't make sense because you will eliminate the individual every time. So to say you're
[02:51:47.060 --> 02:51:52.300]  for gaze doesn't really mean anything because then when they want to make a joke about you,
[02:51:52.300 --> 02:51:56.060]  then they'll make a gay joke. Or to say you're for women, what they don't really, that doesn't
[02:51:56.060 --> 02:52:01.140]  mean anything. That's a very low resolution way of saying something. Everyone's for women,
[02:52:01.140 --> 02:52:05.180]  let's say, but they're not really for women. Are they for Nikki Haley, a brown woman who
[02:52:05.180 --> 02:52:09.180]  happens to be a conservative who's a strong woman? Of course, they're not for her. So
[02:52:09.180 --> 02:52:14.700]  to view people through this very obvious and what I would say really is just a dumb and
[02:52:14.700 --> 02:52:21.100]  insulting lens, you see it drop every time they speak off the cuff. It drops because
[02:52:21.100 --> 02:52:24.900]  they don't really care about the individual. And the Ted Lou clip that you played at the
[02:52:24.900 --> 02:52:28.540]  beginning of this, I mean, man, I don't know when the last time I heard something that
[02:52:28.540 --> 02:52:33.180]  chilling coming from a government official. It's like the First Amendment is the most
[02:52:33.180 --> 02:52:37.740]  precious thing that we have in this country. And I can tell you, as someone that's been
[02:52:37.740 --> 02:52:41.180]  on tour for most of the last year, and I've been to 20 some odd countries in the last
[02:52:41.180 --> 02:52:47.100]  couple months, every single country, the people are jealous of the freedoms that we have here
[02:52:47.100 --> 02:52:52.220]  and especially the freedom of speech. So it's like to hear anyone, regardless of whether
[02:52:52.220 --> 02:52:57.180]  he's a Democrat, Republican, it doesn't matter to hear any elected official saying that he'd
[02:52:57.180 --> 02:53:01.780]  love to get rid of the First Amendment. I mean, I can't imagine anything scarier in
[02:53:01.780 --> 02:53:02.780]  a free society.
[02:53:02.780 --> 02:53:06.580]  Very quickly, I mean, I don't want to pound on the anchor. I don't even know who it was
[02:53:06.580 --> 02:53:11.100]  in that clip, but it was a news anchor whose living obviously is predicated on the First
[02:53:11.100 --> 02:53:15.140]  Amendment. Didn't interrupt him and say, what, I'm sorry, Mr. Elected Official, did
[02:53:15.140 --> 02:53:18.260]  you just say you'd like to control people's speech?
[02:53:18.260 --> 02:53:23.020]  Yeah, well, it's just incredible, and we're seeing an emboldening of this. It's interesting
[02:53:23.020 --> 02:53:27.140]  what you said there, that these are the same people who love to shut people down, but then
[02:53:27.140 --> 02:53:31.940]  at the same time, they'll accidentally or they'll intentionally say some of these things.
[02:53:31.940 --> 02:53:35.460]  You may have seen this today, Dead Spin, which is just another one of these sites that just
[02:53:35.460 --> 02:53:40.580]  turns out a lot of sort of lefty nonsense. They ran a piece today that basically said
[02:53:40.580 --> 02:53:45.460]  the title of the piece was something to the effect of conservative gays should shut the
[02:53:45.460 --> 02:53:51.500]  F up. I mean, imagine that, imagine judging people based on those immutable characteristics
[02:53:51.500 --> 02:53:55.620]  while at the same time telling those people that you're supposedly their allies. And
[02:53:55.620 --> 02:53:59.660]  that's why, again, as I always say to you, Tucker, every time I'm on your show, what
[02:53:59.660 --> 02:54:03.420]  do I tell you? For all the disagreements, the political disagreements that we might have,
[02:54:03.420 --> 02:54:07.660]  which we've discussed on both my show and your show, because you are a staunch defender
[02:54:07.660 --> 02:54:12.100]  of free speech, I will continue to do this with you, whether we agree or not. That's
[02:54:12.100 --> 02:54:13.100]  what America is about.
[02:54:13.100 --> 02:54:18.140]  Democrat Congressman Ted Lew out of California is frustrated by the fact that the First Amendment
[02:54:18.140 --> 02:54:24.460]  is preventing him from silencing conservatives. So he's urging the big tech companies to start
[02:54:24.460 --> 02:54:29.380]  censoring more of us on the government's behalf. Here he is talking with CNN's Breonna
[02:54:29.380 --> 02:54:34.060]  Keeler yesterday, who's disappointed in him that he didn't use his time during Tuesday's
[02:54:34.060 --> 02:54:40.140]  hearing with Google CEO, Sanjay Pichar, to pressure the tech giant to increase their
[02:54:40.140 --> 02:54:41.140]  censorship.
[02:54:41.140 --> 02:54:46.940]  Have you thought that maybe you and other Democrats have missed opportunities to use
[02:54:46.940 --> 02:54:51.820]  your time to press Google CEO at a time when these large tech companies are struggling
[02:54:51.820 --> 02:54:56.540]  to manage content perpetuating conspiracy theories? They're so vulnerable to outside
[02:54:56.540 --> 02:55:01.460]  interference. Isn't that a focus that could have been a missed opportunity?
[02:55:01.460 --> 02:55:05.740]  So it's a very good point you make. I would love if I could have more than five minutes
[02:55:05.740 --> 02:55:11.860]  to question witnesses. Unfortunately, I don't get that opportunity. However, I would love
[02:55:11.860 --> 02:55:17.900]  to be able to regulate the content of speech. The First Amendment prevents me from doing
[02:55:17.900 --> 02:55:23.900]  so. I would urge these private sector companies to regulate it better themselves, but it's
[02:55:23.900 --> 02:55:28.820]  really nothing that I believe government can do. And so that's been my position all
[02:55:28.820 --> 02:55:29.820]  along.
[02:55:29.820 --> 02:55:33.500]  Sorry, Miss Keeler. If you're so concerned about conspiracy theories being spread around,
[02:55:33.500 --> 02:55:37.500]  you should probably stop working for CNN. This guy was one of Google's biggest cheerleaders
[02:55:37.500 --> 02:55:41.540]  during the hearing on Tuesday who said that if conservatives don't like to search results
[02:55:41.540 --> 02:55:45.820]  on Google or don't like what they're seeing on social media, that we should just blame
[02:55:45.820 --> 02:55:46.820]  ourselves.
[02:55:46.820 --> 02:55:50.660]  And to serve my colleagues across the aisle, if you're getting bad press articles and bad
[02:55:50.660 --> 02:55:56.500]  search results, don't blame Google or Facebook or Twitter. Consider blaming yourself.
[02:55:56.500 --> 02:56:01.860]  That little outburst made him a hero amongst the Democrats. How Ted Liu became Google's
[02:56:01.860 --> 02:56:06.900]  accidental champion, reported The Atlantic. This senator from Wired Magazine called it
[02:56:06.900 --> 02:56:11.940]  the best moment in the SunJay Pitsai hearings. Yeah, it's just so cool. Called for the end
[02:56:11.940 --> 02:56:16.780]  of the First Amendment and saying that conservatives should blame themselves for being upset about
[02:56:16.780 --> 02:56:17.780]  that.
[02:56:17.780 --> 02:56:22.060]  And speaking of trying to undermine our republic, Senator Chuck Schumer is now tweeting in a
[02:56:22.060 --> 02:56:27.420]  foreign language because, well, he's a foreign agent trying to overthrow our country from
[02:56:27.420 --> 02:56:32.400]  within. And here's MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski to further illustrate the incredible double
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:38.500]  standards that the liberals have for freedom of speech, uttering a dreaded homophobic slur
[02:56:38.500 --> 02:56:42.660]  on the air, and of course, facing no consequences.
[02:56:42.660 --> 02:56:47.580]  I understand that Donald Trump doesn't care. Heilman makes a good point. He doesn't care.
[02:56:47.580 --> 02:56:53.180]  But why doesn't Mike Pompeo care right now? Are the pathetic deflections that we just
[02:56:53.180 --> 02:57:00.140]  heard when he appeared on Fox and Friends? Is that a patriot speaking or a wannabe dictator's
[02:57:00.140 --> 02:57:01.140]  butt boy?
[02:57:01.140 --> 02:57:05.300]  I'm dead serious. I'm asking, are these the words of a patriot?
[02:57:05.300 --> 02:57:08.580]  It sounds like they tried to mute it out, but they failed. And I personally couldn't
[02:57:08.580 --> 02:57:13.660]  care less than anybody says. As long as they're not calling for violence, it is unprofessional.
[02:57:13.660 --> 02:57:18.980]  But it's MSNBC we're talking about here. But imagine if some YouTuber or someone on
[02:57:18.980 --> 02:57:23.460]  Fox News or on Twitter dared to utter that dreaded slur.
[02:57:23.460 --> 02:57:28.220]  But Mika's job is totally fine, and MSNBC's already forgotten about it. And she says that
[02:57:28.220 --> 02:57:32.960]  she meant to call him a water boy, not a Mike Antibid Quoter. Otherwise, the Thought
[02:57:32.960 --> 02:57:51.140]  Police will come after me.

[02:58:51.520 --> 02:58:55.560]  You saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with InfoWars. Yes, some of them are like
[02:58:55.560 --> 02:58:59.040]  little side accounts. They even know we had like InfoWars stores that just showed our
[02:58:59.040 --> 02:59:04.200]  products, but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally
[02:59:04.200 --> 02:59:08.560]  and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us. Your excitement about America, your excitement
[02:59:08.560 --> 02:59:12.160]  about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink. But the
[02:59:12.160 --> 02:59:17.960]  globalists now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:59:17.960 --> 02:59:23.760]  I want to be troublesome and pesky. I want to keep going. I want to make them do the
[02:59:23.760 --> 02:59:28.480]  ultimate, not just destroy us financially. I want to push all the way. I've committed
[02:59:28.480 --> 02:59:32.600]  to do that. I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen, but you've
[02:59:32.600 --> 02:59:37.640]  got to back us, and I promise you this. I will never falter. I will never waver at the
[02:59:37.640 --> 02:59:41.720]  spiritual level. I physically will, but I give you my commitment if you financially
[02:59:41.720 --> 02:59:50.360]  support us at foreshore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:59:50.360 --> 03:00:07.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:07.560 --> 03:00:17.640]  The raging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:00:17.640 --> 03:00:24.200]  This is Matt Bracken in for the last hour and Friday, and we're into the Christmas season,
[03:00:24.200 --> 03:00:31.720]  and I wish I was full of jolliness and good cheer, but actually I'm pretty much not. I've
[03:00:31.720 --> 03:00:38.160]  been following the news, watching the show. The Ted Lou thing about wishing that we would
[03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:43.240]  have less free speech. It's deserving because that's the left today. They are no longer
[03:00:43.240 --> 03:00:49.360]  interested in a dialogue with us. They just want to shut us up, and I'm reminded of a
[03:00:49.360 --> 03:00:57.520]  quote from a meme that's been floating around. It says that genocides happen when tyrannies
[03:00:57.520 --> 03:01:04.360]  are coming to power and the people are disarmed, but civil wars happen when tyrannies are rising
[03:01:04.360 --> 03:01:09.720]  but the people are armed. At least it looks like we're not going to have a genocide without
[03:01:09.720 --> 03:01:17.520]  a civil war. I just don't see a safe path back to the old America, to the Democratic
[03:01:17.520 --> 03:01:25.960]  Republic that we knew. The problem is that politically today, politicians that are on
[03:01:25.960 --> 03:01:32.240]  the move, they're going to see their best move to be appealing to their radical bases,
[03:01:32.240 --> 03:01:38.160]  to their extreme elements, not to appealing to the middle of America. That's going to
[03:01:38.160 --> 03:01:47.160]  be a losing proposition. I kind of see a parallel today in what happened in the former Yugoslavia
[03:01:47.160 --> 03:01:55.320]  at the end of the Cold War when communism was failing. A politician named Slobodan Milosevic,
[03:01:55.320 --> 03:02:04.880]  he rose to power by appealing to radical Serbian ethnic pride. It got him to become the prime
[03:02:04.880 --> 03:02:10.520]  minister, but it ensured that there'd be a civil war. Something similar to that is going
[03:02:10.520 --> 03:02:16.160]  to happen, I think, in the United States, unfortunately. I don't see a moderate ever
[03:02:16.160 --> 03:02:22.160]  coming to power. I think that if Trump is elected for another term, it'll probably be
[03:02:22.160 --> 03:02:28.640]  a miracle. The Democrats are going to be gunning for him for the next two years with all barrels
[03:02:28.640 --> 03:02:35.560]  blazing. You can see today how we're just in a battle of competing narratives. If you
[03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:41.320]  watch Fox or conservative media, you can see that the Uranium One scandal has never been
[03:02:41.320 --> 03:02:46.480]  investigated. Hillary Clinton got a complete walk. But if you turn the channel, if you
[03:02:46.480 --> 03:02:54.200]  clicks over to watch CNN or MSNBC, all you'll hear is that President Trump was somehow involved
[03:02:54.200 --> 03:02:58.880]  with Russians. It's never really explained that all of his cabinet members are deserting
[03:02:58.880 --> 03:03:06.640]  him, that he's a complete failure, that he'll probably be impeached over campaign contribution
[03:03:06.640 --> 03:03:12.560]  violations, which is, we know it's bogus, but that's the narrative that's being floated
[03:03:12.560 --> 03:03:20.040]  to half of the country. So you can see these forces are just pulling us apart. And I don't
[03:03:20.040 --> 03:03:29.400]  see a way back to safety. So I guess the message today is buy some more ammunition for Christmas.
[03:03:29.400 --> 03:03:36.280]  And if you only have one AR-15, you better get another one. States like New Jersey,
[03:03:36.280 --> 03:03:42.720]  where they've banned magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. It's just a question of time
[03:03:42.720 --> 03:03:48.520]  before they start arresting people because they can tell by who's bought what where these
[03:03:48.520 --> 03:03:55.640]  magazines are. Even in my own state of Florida, they're doing these RPOs, these public safety
[03:03:55.640 --> 03:04:03.920]  orders. The initials are different in each state, but they red flagged gun owners and
[03:04:03.920 --> 03:04:08.640]  literally go to their house to collect their guns. I don't see a, I don't see a soft landing
[03:04:08.640 --> 03:04:16.920]  out of all of this. I really don't. And, you know, if history is a guide, I think that
[03:04:16.920 --> 03:04:23.080]  civil war is ahead of us, unfortunately. Anyway, that's my cheerful Christmas message. And
[03:04:23.080 --> 03:04:30.360]  we'll maybe get to the range and do some shooting and have some fun where we can. When we come
[03:04:30.360 --> 03:04:35.080]  back from the break, I'm going to take calls for the rest of the hour. Matt Bracken for

[03:06:17.600 --> 03:06:25.360]  Okay, we're back and for the rest of the hour I'm going to try to clear through the
[03:06:25.360 --> 03:06:29.920]  board because you're on the phone calls. In the past I've called into shows and I know
[03:06:29.920 --> 03:06:34.840]  how frustrating it can be to be listening to the show through your telephone for an
[03:06:34.840 --> 03:06:40.160]  hour or so. So let's go to Alex and Michigan first and waiting for an hour and a half.
[03:06:40.160 --> 03:06:43.520]  I think that's long enough. Can you hear me, Alex?
[03:06:43.520 --> 03:06:50.040]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Matt. God bless you and God bless all the Info Warriors
[03:06:50.040 --> 03:06:57.920]  out there. Merry Christmas. If you haven't already, go to the InfoWarsStore.com and buy
[03:06:57.920 --> 03:07:06.240]  yourself the X2 or the fish oil or the real red pill or the water. I think I need it.
[03:07:06.240 --> 03:07:13.760]  Yes. It'll be a great Christmas gift to everyone under the tree. Even if they're not InfoWars
[03:07:13.760 --> 03:07:18.760]  listeners, it'll be a great way to spread the word. And I think in relation to what
[03:07:18.760 --> 03:07:25.920]  you're talking about, it's not really a civil war, but it's an Info War. And so our ammunition
[03:07:25.920 --> 03:07:33.280]  has to be information to counter their stupid narrative that were Russian agents or Trump
[03:07:33.280 --> 03:07:40.640]  violated a campaign finance law when Hillary allegedly got like $400 million from Bill
[03:07:40.640 --> 03:07:47.280]  Browder out of Russia, allegedly. So why is no one looking at that, you know?
[03:07:47.280 --> 03:07:53.280]  Yeah. In terms of this being an Info War, you're absolutely right. But the problem is
[03:07:53.280 --> 03:07:59.880]  that we seem to be on divided tracks, like two parallel tunnels in the mountain that
[03:07:59.880 --> 03:08:06.240]  barely communicate and barely see each other's narrative. People just choose the information
[03:08:06.240 --> 03:08:12.200]  path that they want. So for a while, it was a fair fight on Twitter or Facebook, but we've
[03:08:12.200 --> 03:08:16.640]  seen how that went. And as soon as you get any traction, you know, your shadow band or
[03:08:16.640 --> 03:08:22.800]  you're just kicked off completely, I was kicked off of Twitter just for a burka meme that
[03:08:22.800 --> 03:08:29.600]  didn't even name a religion. You know, some Muslim objected to a meme about burkas, and
[03:08:29.600 --> 03:08:33.880]  I was gone from Twitter. So I don't see how we can compete in the Info War when we're
[03:08:33.880 --> 03:08:39.560]  only talking to our own audience. So that's one of my main concerns right now. And I don't
[03:08:39.560 --> 03:08:44.800]  know if you have any ideas other than, I mean, I promote alternative social media, like,
[03:08:44.800 --> 03:08:53.200]  you know, you know, using BitShoot and Brightion instead of YouTube, which is Google, Google,
[03:08:53.200 --> 03:09:00.680]  or using Gab or Freezoxy or other social media sites, instead of just, you know, Facebook
[03:09:00.680 --> 03:09:06.960]  and Twitter. But those are such tiny audiences compared to the monoliths, the leviathons
[03:09:06.960 --> 03:09:12.800]  of Google, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. I don't see how we get any traction when error
[03:09:12.800 --> 03:09:18.040]  volumes are dialed down on those, on the main social media sites. You know, maybe I'm in
[03:09:18.040 --> 03:09:23.240]  a depressed frame of mind right now, but I don't see us making progress. You have any
[03:09:23.240 --> 03:09:25.240]  ideas?
[03:09:25.240 --> 03:09:29.720]  Trump definitely needs to act. If we could all just sign up for a lawsuit like me, you,
[03:09:29.720 --> 03:09:34.360]  Alex Jones, everybody else, sign up at InfoWars.com, set something up, we're here, I'll sign up
[03:09:34.360 --> 03:09:39.560]  for a lawsuit, and we would totally win. And because that's the reason we might get into
[03:09:39.560 --> 03:09:43.520]  a civil war is because we can't get, we can't win the information war, so we go into a civil
[03:09:43.520 --> 03:09:44.520]  war.
[03:09:44.520 --> 03:09:50.880]  Yeah, if there's a, if the only thing I can see Congress doing, and of course the Democrats
[03:09:50.880 --> 03:09:58.640]  are going to run Congress now, if they even try to treat big social media as a utility
[03:09:58.640 --> 03:10:03.280]  and have the government running it, well, that just means eventually people like Ted
[03:10:03.280 --> 03:10:09.720]  Liu will be writing the law. And, you know, it'll, it'll, I think it'll codify politically
[03:10:09.720 --> 03:10:18.080]  correct ideas. So I think that we need to, you know, I don't know how we can work it
[03:10:18.080 --> 03:10:23.360]  because any, any attempts to, to level the playing field on Facebook, I just see it working
[03:10:23.360 --> 03:10:25.360]  against us in the long run.
[03:10:25.360 --> 03:10:30.400]  You know, I wish that Trump would go and declassify everything in sight. I mean, gosh, I'd like
[03:10:30.400 --> 03:10:34.760]  to see the guy take the U.S. Marshals into the Department of Justice and force them to
[03:10:34.760 --> 03:10:38.480]  turn over documents, you know, to tell them, you know, you turn them over or you're going
[03:10:38.480 --> 03:10:43.280]  to be arrested. But it just shows that even a, even a president of the United States has
[03:10:43.280 --> 03:10:49.480]  less power than the, than the, than the bureaucracy, the, the entrenched deep state. And they've
[03:10:49.480 --> 03:10:55.480]  got the media, they've got still most of the FBI Department of Justice, the Intel agencies,
[03:10:55.480 --> 03:11:00.440]  the man's up against everything. And, you know, I guess sticking with Trump is the strongest
[03:11:00.440 --> 03:11:07.320]  thing we can do. But, but I'm at a loss for how to get more traction in the, in the information
[03:11:07.320 --> 03:11:12.560]  war. Of course, support info was, you know, byproducts from the store, but it seems like
[03:11:12.560 --> 03:11:18.040]  we're just talking to ourselves and, and, you know, big, big media and big social media
[03:11:18.040 --> 03:11:20.960]  is still dominating the country.
[03:11:20.960 --> 03:11:24.360]  Anyway, let's go ahead.
[03:11:24.360 --> 03:11:30.640]  If Trump could take military action, like arrest traders, ideally, but if he bare minimum
[03:11:30.640 --> 03:11:33.640]  can't even get the information out with the advisor warrant, like you're talking about,
[03:11:33.640 --> 03:11:37.880]  like that's not a good sign. Like if he can't get the information out for ammunition in
[03:11:37.880 --> 03:11:41.920]  the info war, we have no shot. So he's got to do that at least.
[03:11:41.920 --> 03:11:47.440]  Yeah, I think that, I think that the big, a big move, you know, he has to be assured
[03:11:47.440 --> 03:11:53.600]  that Mueller doesn't have any more big aces to play, then do the big, the big declassification.
[03:11:53.600 --> 03:11:57.640]  But I don't know why he doesn't. I don't know what the, what the grip is that they've got
[03:11:57.640 --> 03:12:05.600]  over him that he can't do that. But thanks, Alex. And let's go to Sean and PA also been
[03:12:05.600 --> 03:12:08.200]  holding for a long time. Go ahead, Sean.
[03:12:08.200 --> 03:12:13.680]  Hey, Matt. Thanks for hosting your literally my favorite guest host.
[03:12:13.680 --> 03:12:14.680]  Thank you.
[03:12:14.680 --> 03:12:22.120]  All right. The way that I see this is we elected Trump to get four years as president. We see
[03:12:22.120 --> 03:12:28.840]  the end of that race being when the deep state goes down, the Democrats see it as when Trump
[03:12:28.840 --> 03:12:33.640]  gets impeached. So the way that I'm thinking of this whole thing is that it's kind of a
[03:12:33.640 --> 03:12:38.760]  tortoise and a hair race, and that the Democrats are the hairs, they're bouncing all over the
[03:12:38.760 --> 03:12:43.520]  place from one new story to the next. No matter how false it is, while Trump slowly marches
[03:12:43.520 --> 03:12:48.880]  along, yeah, you start lining everything up, there's moves, there's counter moves.
[03:12:48.880 --> 03:12:54.000]  And I'm I'm still pretty positive that there's going to be some stuff happening. One thing
[03:12:54.000 --> 03:13:00.160]  in particular, which I'm not sure about, which I'd like to get your take on is, is John Huber
[03:13:00.160 --> 03:13:05.400]  youth hall. There are some stuff. I don't know if you saw the testimony yesterday, but
[03:13:05.400 --> 03:13:09.800]  you know, there are some things in there that were that were pretty enlightening. But at
[03:13:09.800 --> 03:13:13.600]  the same time, there was something that was pretty scary that they said they had to give
[03:13:13.600 --> 03:13:18.040]  viewers guys the information three times. Now, I don't know if that's government bureaucracy
[03:13:18.040 --> 03:13:22.600]  getting in the way, or if there's people even on Dupers team that are blocking things. But
[03:13:22.600 --> 03:13:28.400]  I'd like to get your take on his, his investigation, because we haven't really heard anything other
[03:13:28.400 --> 03:13:31.520]  than it exists. And they're looking at the Clinton Foundation.
[03:13:31.520 --> 03:13:38.480]  Yeah, that there's been a few strings or parallel threads that we've been, you know, hoping
[03:13:38.480 --> 03:13:44.320]  one, one was that Jeff Sessions was just playing the quiet guy. But meanwhile, he was secretly
[03:13:44.320 --> 03:13:51.000]  stacking everything up. That turned out to be a total fantasy. The guy was a nothing.
[03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:57.680]  And then there, then there's the AI, the, the, what do you call it, the inspector general.
[03:13:57.680 --> 03:14:01.600]  Oh, he the inspector general is going to do it. The inspector general has those peanut
[03:14:01.600 --> 03:14:07.080]  powers is no, you know, no powers, really. And other than what the DOJ wants to give
[03:14:07.080 --> 03:14:12.120]  him. And I don't see anything coming from that. Then there's all hubris out there. He's
[03:14:12.120 --> 03:14:19.240]  got his own, you know, maybe there are secret grand juries going on. I saw a couple of the
[03:14:19.240 --> 03:14:24.640]  regulars on Hannity last night. They seemed pretty optimistic, you know, Solomon Carter,
[03:14:24.640 --> 03:14:30.040]  the usual bunch, but nothing ever seems to come of it. I think that one thing that, that
[03:14:30.040 --> 03:14:36.160]  Trump is doing that is strong, that's, that's, you know, really a strong, a strong card to
[03:14:36.160 --> 03:14:41.080]  play is just the border. If Pelosi is going to go to shut down the government over no
[03:14:41.080 --> 03:14:47.200]  wall, I think that's a win for Trump. Just keep hammering that. I mean, gosh, where did
[03:14:47.200 --> 03:14:55.080]  Obama find $150 billion to give to Iran? They found out they just pulled 150 billion out
[03:14:55.080 --> 03:15:02.360]  of the hat to give to Iran. And the Democrats won't give 5 billion for border security.
[03:15:02.360 --> 03:15:08.680]  And I'd be even more blunt than Trump. The Democrats want more illegal aliens. They want
[03:15:08.680 --> 03:15:14.000]  people coming into the country, you know, the dumber and the sicker and the better is
[03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:19.860]  every, every person that sneaks into the country requires immediately federal government employees.
[03:15:19.860 --> 03:15:25.600]  That means the Democrats, you know, to support and assist them medically with education,
[03:15:25.600 --> 03:15:30.640]  social services, everything. So, you know, I would keep beating on the, the drum of border
[03:15:30.640 --> 03:15:37.280]  security for as long as possible, as hard as possible. But as far as hoping for Huber,
[03:15:37.280 --> 03:15:41.200]  I don't, I don't see it. I've pretty much given up hope that there's some like, it's
[03:15:41.200 --> 03:15:46.160]  like the Germans at the end of the war hoping for the super weapon, you know, sooner or
[03:15:46.160 --> 03:15:51.840]  later, the super weapon is coming. It never came. Anyway, we'll be back after the break
[03:15:51.840 --> 03:15:53.000]  with more calls.
[03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:58.600]  Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked
[03:15:58.600 --> 03:16:04.880]  the place. And what they don't steal will be destroyed. This year, resolve not to be

[03:17:22.440 --> 03:17:27.120]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize
[03:17:27.120 --> 03:17:31.680]  my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating
[03:17:31.680 --> 03:17:35.720]  them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people
[03:17:35.720 --> 03:17:39.720]  deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you
[03:17:39.720 --> 03:17:43.960]  owe taxes, you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax
[03:17:43.960 --> 03:17:53.960]  case. Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:17:53.960 --> 03:17:58.840]  In the last few months, Info Wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory
[03:17:58.840 --> 03:18:02.240]  of many of our best-selling items. And then I came up with the idea last week, let's not
[03:18:02.240 --> 03:18:07.880]  just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off double-patriot points. Let's extend
[03:18:07.880 --> 03:18:14.720]  that sale but also add a free gift with every order. Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free,
[03:18:14.720 --> 03:18:20.720]  colloidal silver, iodine, 4-5 super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt
[03:18:20.720 --> 03:18:24.560]  while supplies last. And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these
[03:18:24.560 --> 03:18:28.880]  are going to be selling out. So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the
[03:18:28.880 --> 03:18:32.600]  day that's there until it sells out. Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for
[03:18:32.600 --> 03:18:37.400]  the next group of orders. So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other
[03:18:37.400 --> 03:18:42.480]  sale we've ever had. So this is a loss leader. We are losing money on this. This is our biggest
[03:18:42.480 --> 03:18:47.920]  sale ever. Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything. And don't fight the crowds. InfoWarsStore.com,
[03:18:47.920 --> 03:18:53.920]  or triple-8253-3139. God bless you and thank you for your support.
[03:18:53.920 --> 03:19:00.120]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about World Government, the attack on the family,
[03:19:00.120 --> 03:19:05.000]  the eugenics operations, the whole thing. We've been proven dead on. You've been proven
[03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:09.480]  dead on as supporters and listeners of this project. You've been the men and women of
[03:19:09.480 --> 03:19:15.560]  the arena and I really do thank you and salute you. All words are not enough. Think about
[03:19:15.560 --> 03:19:20.240]  all the different systems, all the different political ideologies that you have been on
[03:19:20.240 --> 03:19:25.400]  target, promoting Americana and Renaissance, an open free society against the globalist
[03:19:25.400 --> 03:19:29.440]  and the dominant world force. They've created a tower of babel with a bunch of people that
[03:19:29.440 --> 03:19:33.960]  can't communicate with each other. But we have cut right to the chase, human liberty,
[03:19:33.960 --> 03:19:38.400]  a pro-human future versus the globalist and a human future. And that's why I want to thank
[03:19:38.400 --> 03:19:43.200]  you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[03:19:43.200 --> 03:19:48.440]  I am in your hands and we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to infowarsport.com
[03:19:48.440 --> 03:19:52.200]  and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and funding InfoWars,
[03:19:52.200 --> 03:19:56.720]  a true 360 win.
[03:19:56.720 --> 03:20:20.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:20.720 --> 03:20:28.640]  I'm about as far from a surfing safari mood as it can be. It's a cold, dreary, rainy day
[03:20:28.640 --> 03:20:35.280]  here and it seems pretty bleak. I know things I'll cheer up, don't worry. I won't give
[03:20:35.280 --> 03:20:42.480]  up but at the moment I'm not in a great mood. Let's see if Chris in Tennessee can throw
[03:20:42.480 --> 03:20:48.240]  some brightness onto the matter. Go ahead, Chris, you there?
[03:20:48.240 --> 03:20:54.200]  Hey, Matt. Hey, I hope you're doing good. I know you're in bad spirits but I hope you're
[03:20:54.200 --> 03:21:00.440]  still having time to have some fun and just relax despite everything that's going on.
[03:21:00.440 --> 03:21:03.120]  Yeah, if it ever stops raining.
[03:21:03.120 --> 03:21:11.360]  Yeah, it's raining here too. I wanted to say this to Alex but I love you too so I'm going
[03:21:11.360 --> 03:21:16.680]  to go ahead and just spit it all off if you'll be so kind as to give me 20 seconds to spout
[03:21:16.680 --> 03:21:20.280]  off my first two points. I want to get to my third one which I feel like is very, very
[03:21:20.280 --> 03:21:21.280]  important.
[03:21:21.280 --> 03:21:24.120]  Sure, go ahead.
[03:21:24.120 --> 03:21:29.040]  Number one, there's some great deals going on right now at infowarstore.com. I just
[03:21:29.040 --> 03:21:36.160]  bought about, I spent less than $100 on $250 worth of product. Got a free t-shirt with
[03:21:36.160 --> 03:21:40.440]  it too so I urge all the listeners to go check that out.
[03:21:40.440 --> 03:21:47.480]  Number two, I had the pleasure of re-washing the movie Waking Life, the Richard Link, the
[03:21:47.480 --> 03:21:49.680]  Link Letter movie.
[03:21:49.680 --> 03:21:57.040]  Holy moly, that is a great movie and Alex Jones has a fantastic rant in that movie.
[03:21:57.040 --> 03:22:02.200]  I urge everybody to just go check that movie out and Healthy Dose of Cannabis is not going
[03:22:02.200 --> 03:22:08.520]  to hurt the experience. It's great.
[03:22:08.520 --> 03:22:24.480]  Number three, only if it's in an illegal state do it, but my last point and I do feel like
[03:22:24.480 --> 03:22:32.840]  this is super important and I hope Alex and Gavin and Anthony Kumi or somebody needs to
[03:22:32.840 --> 03:22:41.360]  get this message to them at because everybody I know under the age of 35 listens to the
[03:22:41.360 --> 03:22:48.440]  Joe Rogan experience, he's basically bigger than Oprah in my opinion. I think that's an
[03:22:48.440 --> 03:22:54.240]  arguable fact that Joe Rogan's podcast is bigger than Oprah ever was.
[03:22:54.240 --> 03:23:04.000]  I think that Alex and Owen Benjamin and Gavin and anybody else who's friends with Rogan
[03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:11.080]  needs to really get on his butt about getting Alex on, getting Gavin back on because I know
[03:23:11.080 --> 03:23:16.520]  so many people that listen to that podcast and we're talking about a culture war, an
[03:23:16.520 --> 03:23:22.480]  information war, that's a big platform for Alex or Gavin or whoever to get their message
[03:23:22.480 --> 03:23:30.640]  across and we have a real problem where like Alex and you have been talking about, we seem
[03:23:30.640 --> 03:23:35.920]  to be kind of in an echo chamber right now and that's a big platform for them to get
[03:23:35.920 --> 03:23:41.440]  their ideas across and I know even, I don't know if you heard it, but Anthony Kumi was
[03:23:41.440 --> 03:23:47.320]  just on Rogan and you could tell Joe really looks up to Rogan. I mean, Joe really looks
[03:23:47.320 --> 03:23:55.440]  up to Anthony Kumi and I think all that group of guys really need to just start bugging
[03:23:55.440 --> 03:24:01.920]  Joe, just start hassling him like, hey, you say you're our friend, you really need to
[03:24:01.920 --> 03:24:06.640]  have us on, especially Alex. Alex needs to get back on Joe Rogan. I know he announced
[03:24:06.640 --> 03:24:10.880]  that podcast a while ago, he needs to get back, he needs to really have Anthony Kumi
[03:24:10.880 --> 03:24:16.600]  and Owen Benjamin just get on Joe's butt and get back on there because that's where
[03:24:16.600 --> 03:24:17.600]  we're going to win the culture.
[03:24:17.600 --> 03:24:24.640]  There's all of these programming kind of decisions. I'm sure that's hard up the chain
[03:24:24.640 --> 03:24:30.280]  of command, but that's way over my pay grade. I really don't know about all the ins and
[03:24:30.280 --> 03:24:37.960]  outs of who's in with who and who's out with who. I don't like the squabbling on airside.
[03:24:37.960 --> 03:24:46.520]  I knew there's sometimes all kind of factors I'm not privy to, but in general, if you have
[03:24:46.520 --> 03:24:53.880]  a choice between watching somebody's video or podcast, try to stay. It's difficult because
[03:24:53.880 --> 03:25:00.440]  it's so convenient. Of course, it's very convenient to use YouTube, but try to find other places,
[03:25:00.440 --> 03:25:11.200]  like Brady on, Bitshoot, Zoxie, things like that. Try to find the, and encourage podcasters
[03:25:11.200 --> 03:25:18.480]  not to just make the easy way, which is YouTube. Encourage people to use alternative social
[03:25:18.480 --> 03:25:26.080]  media. It's the only way I think we're going to eventually make a debt if it's even possible.
[03:25:26.080 --> 03:25:34.000]  I haven't been listening to Joe Rogan lately. I'm obviously not a millennial, but it's
[03:25:34.000 --> 03:25:41.920]  a good idea. I'll have to check it out. Thanks a lot. Justin, in California, you're hanging
[03:25:41.920 --> 03:25:46.080]  on there? You're on the cultural war? Go ahead, Justin.
[03:25:46.080 --> 03:25:52.360]  We're taking my call on that. I was just echoing with what you said earlier. I think a civil
[03:25:52.360 --> 03:25:56.600]  war is coming too, but I think one way that we can stop it is get more of a voice in pop
[03:25:56.600 --> 03:26:03.200]  culture. It was really great to see the last caller. He was bringing up the Joe Rogan show,
[03:26:03.200 --> 03:26:07.280]  and I wanted to mention that as well. It was really great to see Shooter Jennings on the
[03:26:07.280 --> 03:26:13.920]  Joe Rogan show, really go to bat for Alex. I went to a lot of his shows, and I found
[03:26:13.920 --> 03:26:17.960]  out with them a few times, and Shooter's a really great guy. It was really great to
[03:26:17.960 --> 03:26:25.240]  see him really speaking out for Alex and saying, we need to all back up the First Amendment.
[03:26:25.240 --> 03:26:31.880]  For him to go on that show and make that statement, it was really big. I think a lot more of
[03:26:31.880 --> 03:26:36.320]  Alex's audience should reach out and support people like Shooter Jennings, people that
[03:26:36.320 --> 03:26:44.560]  are coming to bat for our side. I work for a certain government agency, sir, and I'm
[03:26:44.560 --> 03:26:49.240]  a CSR. There's a customer service representative. I take a lot of calls from a lot of college
[03:26:49.240 --> 03:26:54.320]  kids, and these kids are just really, really ignorant and have no clue what's going on,
[03:26:54.320 --> 03:26:59.720]  zero life experience. I think if we really could get something in pop culture that could
[03:26:59.720 --> 03:27:07.240]  show that our side, our views and our opinion, and not make it look out to be stupid or racist
[03:27:07.240 --> 03:27:12.640]  or xenophobic or whatever words that they want to put on, when they attack the more
[03:27:12.640 --> 03:27:17.480]  conservative side, I think if we really support these voices that are going to bat for us
[03:27:17.480 --> 03:27:22.000]  and make them bigger stars, that's going to help our side as well.
[03:27:22.000 --> 03:27:29.880]  I don't know how that's accomplished. I've been fighting this culture war for years.
[03:27:29.880 --> 03:27:36.560]  My first novel was 15 years old. People for years have been saying they should be made
[03:27:36.560 --> 03:27:44.080]  into movies, my books. This is my own fighting in the culture war, but it's hard to get traction
[03:27:44.080 --> 03:27:49.880]  when everything is lined up towards the left. Anything that starts to get traction, you
[03:27:49.880 --> 03:27:57.960]  get kicked off of Twitter. We keep fighting. I wish there were movie producers out there.
[03:27:57.960 --> 03:28:02.720]  There have been a few in the past. There are great movies that could be made, television
[03:28:02.720 --> 03:28:09.120]  shows too, but I don't see the funding for it. Everybody talks about these things, but
[03:28:09.120 --> 03:28:16.720]  the money never comes through. I think that alternative social media, it's the only place
[03:28:16.720 --> 03:28:24.520]  we've got. You can make videos that won't be banned. YouTube has taken off 50 million
[03:28:24.520 --> 03:28:30.640]  videos in the last year. They just put the thumb down and you're gone. How can you reach
[03:28:30.640 --> 03:28:35.800]  a mass cultural audience when your videos are taken down? Then you have to self-censor
[03:28:35.800 --> 03:28:43.920]  to keep it so that they'll not just kick it off of YouTube. Mark Dice can't even say
[03:28:43.920 --> 03:28:52.040]  the word that got, what's your name on Morning Joe in trouble. He's afraid to say that word.
[03:28:52.040 --> 03:28:56.840]  It's ridiculous. Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse. Relief
[03:28:56.840 --> 03:29:01.480]  for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads. Well, the last thing I want is to take

[03:29:52.120 --> 03:29:58.880]  I don't have to tell our listeners and viewers how important M4 Wars is in the fight against
[03:29:58.880 --> 03:30:03.840]  the anti-human globalist. So let's say it's short and sweet. We need your support now
[03:30:03.840 --> 03:30:08.200]  more than ever. You've come through a thousand times since I'm not bitching at you. I'm just
[03:30:08.200 --> 03:30:12.320]  simply telling you, we are in the thick of the battle now. The attacks on M4 Wars have
[03:30:12.320 --> 03:30:17.480]  become absolutely exponential and down the road, we probably will get destroyed. But
[03:30:17.480 --> 03:30:21.640]  I know and God has really put it on my heart that we've got to maintain the fight as hard
[03:30:21.640 --> 03:30:26.760]  as possible and go through as much as we can to be an example to others and carry out
[03:30:26.760 --> 03:30:31.640]  critical operations ahead of whatever happens. But I want to be strong in this fight. I need
[03:30:31.640 --> 03:30:35.640]  to be provisioned and I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros and the Rothschilds
[03:30:35.640 --> 03:30:39.360]  and all these devil worshipers. But I need your prayers. I need you to spread the articles
[03:30:39.360 --> 03:30:43.360]  and videos. I need you to give us financial support right now. We make it easy. Do your
[03:30:43.360 --> 03:30:48.680]  Christmas shopping with us, not with the globalists and not with Bezos and Amazon and you'll help
[03:30:48.680 --> 03:30:53.360]  provision us. We've got a bunch of huge deals at M4WarsTour.com. So please take action right

[03:31:13.520 --> 03:31:19.400]  work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in

[03:33:26.000 --> 03:33:34.160]  Okay, I'm looking at the board and I see a lot of patient people on hold and let's
[03:33:34.160 --> 03:33:40.720]  go to Clinton, Texas, who also has an idea about coming Civil War. Clint, are you there?
[03:33:40.720 --> 03:33:47.520]  Yes, sir, I am. First of all, I just wanted to say thank you and everybody for all that
[03:33:47.520 --> 03:33:56.000]  we are all trying to do. It's hard. Actually, I was listening to you while I was working
[03:33:56.000 --> 03:34:04.680]  and I stopped what I was doing. I think you're absolutely right. There's going to be no way
[03:34:04.680 --> 03:34:13.480]  out of Civil War. It's just inevitable. I like to be optimistic, but you know how the
[03:34:13.480 --> 03:34:20.600]  funniest things like to go on during holidays and people don't pay attention. I don't know,
[03:34:20.600 --> 03:34:28.360]  there's something about this Christmas holidays as you know how you have that gut feeling,
[03:34:28.360 --> 03:34:39.400]  that gut instinct that just gets at you. Well, I think honestly they're going to either
[03:34:39.400 --> 03:34:45.960]  one, crash the stock market either right during the holidays or right after. Number two, during
[03:34:45.960 --> 03:34:52.520]  that time, I feel that something is going to happen to our president and number three,
[03:34:52.520 --> 03:34:58.680]  it'll ultimately just lead to a Civil War scenario. That's just kind of how it all seems
[03:34:58.680 --> 03:35:03.280]  to be playing out. It could be totally wrong. What are your thoughts?
[03:35:03.280 --> 03:35:10.640]  I think that the deep state plotters, Brennan, Clapper, Mueller, and all of their minions
[03:35:10.640 --> 03:35:18.000]  and lackeys, I think that they're amazed that Trump is still standing. The guy's got skin
[03:35:18.000 --> 03:35:24.240]  thicker than a rhinoceros and they're shooting at him and they thought he would be down long
[03:35:24.240 --> 03:35:32.640]  ago and he's still standing strong. So I think that there will be some people out there that
[03:35:32.640 --> 03:35:36.560]  will just say, look, the only way we're going to get rid of this guy is to get rid of him.
[03:35:39.040 --> 03:35:44.480]  Maybe it'll be some kind of a plausible accident. I always worry about airplanes and helicopters,
[03:35:44.480 --> 03:35:51.840]  things like that. Or maybe it won't, but I'll guarantee you some of these deep state people,
[03:35:51.840 --> 03:35:57.760]  they're very panicked. And it's not just Democrats. Trump being such an outsider,
[03:35:58.480 --> 03:36:03.920]  he threatens to expose a lot of corruption. And the corruption is not only among the Democrats.
[03:36:04.560 --> 03:36:10.800]  So there are entrenched forces that have been on all kind of corrupt graded trains for decades.
[03:36:10.800 --> 03:36:17.120]  And Trump is really a danger to that status quo and they would like to see him get gone.
[03:36:17.680 --> 03:36:22.160]  As far as the stock market, of course, it's inevitable. But are there people,
[03:36:22.160 --> 03:36:27.840]  you know, George Soros, et cetera, who would if they could swing the market to cause it to crash?
[03:36:28.560 --> 03:36:34.000]  No doubt. And if and when this happens, it's a recession is inevitable. When it happens,
[03:36:34.000 --> 03:36:39.360]  they're going to blame Trump 100%. So just as the, while the economy's been strong
[03:36:39.360 --> 03:36:44.880]  and the unemployment numbers and so forth have been strong, the media doesn't say a word to give
[03:36:44.880 --> 03:36:50.720]  him credit. But if the economy crashes, you can bet he's going to get 100% of the blame.
[03:36:51.280 --> 03:36:57.520]  And you can see that there are, there are still things happening. Like this Chinese business
[03:36:57.520 --> 03:37:03.520]  woman that was arrested in Canada, this, the arrest was made. I think while Trump was actually
[03:37:03.520 --> 03:37:07.360]  speaking to her meeting with the Chinese, and I don't think he knew about it, I think this was
[03:37:07.360 --> 03:37:14.480]  a complete, this is a shot at Trump showing that, you know, the deep state can still like
[03:37:14.480 --> 03:37:20.800]  meddle in international, you know, affairs. This is a very huge woman in China that was
[03:37:20.800 --> 03:37:27.680]  arrested basically while changing flights, changing planes in Canada. And she was grabbed.
[03:37:28.240 --> 03:37:32.800]  You know, this imagine, you know, like a Steve Jobs, somebody were, you know,
[03:37:32.800 --> 03:37:39.360]  you know, a boss ahead of Facebook or Google being arrested, changing planes in Hong Kong.
[03:37:39.360 --> 03:37:45.600]  And then, you know, this is a huge news in China. It's not in America. But, you know,
[03:37:45.600 --> 03:37:51.360]  the deep state is actively meddling and trying to take out Trump. And I think that it's going to
[03:37:51.360 --> 03:37:55.760]  continue and get worse, especially if there's any kind of a market crash. So he's going to be
[03:37:55.760 --> 03:38:04.720]  blamed 100%. Yeah, Debbie. Yeah. Thanks, Clint. Debbie in New Jersey have been waiting a long time.
[03:38:05.360 --> 03:38:09.920]  Go ahead, Debbie. What did you want to say? First, I want to say Merry Christmas to all you guys,
[03:38:09.920 --> 03:38:16.400]  and especially you, Matt. Thanks. Please cheer up. I want you to know I was married to an outlaw
[03:38:16.400 --> 03:38:31.040]  biker. If the deep state does not think that the outlaw bikers, Hell's Angels in this country,
[03:38:31.040 --> 03:38:37.040]  I was married to one, is going to stand by and let these sons of bitches take this country over.
[03:38:37.040 --> 03:38:43.520]  They are sadly mistaken. I have firsthand knowledge. I know for a fact these guys are
[03:38:43.520 --> 03:38:49.680]  going to step up to the plate. Not only that, I have a summer home in Hebron, Maryland,
[03:38:49.680 --> 03:38:57.120]  where the biggest militia is. And I have plenty of friends down there. People are going to stand
[03:38:57.120 --> 03:39:05.040]  up. People are ready, and they are silently waiting. Everybody should know, have faith.
[03:39:06.000 --> 03:39:12.560]  Prepare yourself. Don't be afraid. We're here in New Jersey, and we're not afraid they come to this
[03:39:12.560 --> 03:39:18.240]  door. Well, they'll have to take us out in a body bag if we lose. But I do not plan on going to prison.
[03:39:18.240 --> 03:39:27.520]  I'll tell you that. Well, I appreciate that spirit. But I think most people, as long as there's
[03:39:27.520 --> 03:39:33.680]  electricity, food in the refrigerator, their smartphone is charged up and has all the latest
[03:39:33.680 --> 03:39:39.360]  steps, I don't think they really care what happens politically. It's hard to motivate people,
[03:39:39.360 --> 03:39:46.000]  concepts like freedom of speech. What does that matter to people that are just watching viral
[03:39:46.000 --> 03:39:52.320]  videos all day, playing video games? As long as the power is on and they're not hungry,
[03:39:52.880 --> 03:39:59.520]  I think that they'll accept almost anything politically. But what comes after a civil war
[03:39:59.520 --> 03:40:09.120]  is almost surely going to be some form of economic collapse, cut off of, imagine just
[03:40:09.120 --> 03:40:15.280]  if the truckers went on a strike, for example, or imagine if something happened that food and
[03:40:15.280 --> 03:40:19.760]  diesel fuel weren't being distributed because it was too dangerous to drive down the highway.
[03:40:21.120 --> 03:40:26.880]  In a modern civil war, the infrastructure is just too vulnerable. Any aggrieved party,
[03:40:26.880 --> 03:40:32.880]  any small splinter group can pretty much shut down the freeways without being too graphic.
[03:40:32.880 --> 03:40:39.280]  It's not rocket science to imagine how this can happen. But then everybody suffers. Once
[03:40:39.280 --> 03:40:46.320]  everybody is suffering, the media will then portray the patriotic side as terrorists. It's
[03:40:46.320 --> 03:40:53.040]  predictable. And then I guess we'll be in it. We'll just have to see what happens then. But
[03:40:53.040 --> 03:40:56.640]  I don't want to see anybody carried out in body bags. I wish we could raise awareness
[03:40:56.640 --> 03:41:04.400]  about our steadily diminishing freedoms short of that. But we'll just have to see.
[03:41:06.160 --> 03:41:15.360]  Alan Texas, so a war vet. Go ahead, Al. Go ahead. I want to talk specifically to the people who
[03:41:15.360 --> 03:41:21.680]  are getting very frustrated and saying that we have to or that we will move to a revolution.
[03:41:21.680 --> 03:41:27.920]  You know, when you're old enough to remember World War II, it gives you a perspective. I have
[03:41:27.920 --> 03:41:32.960]  personally witnessed every political revolution of the 20th century, not including the Bolshevik
[03:41:32.960 --> 03:41:40.480]  Revolution. They are notoriously counterproductive. You always end up with something far worse than
[03:41:40.480 --> 03:41:46.240]  you overthrew. And I'm looking at where we stand. We've got a couple years left with Trump.
[03:41:46.240 --> 03:41:54.000]  He seems to me to be remarkably incompetent. But it doesn't matter. He's going to be gone,
[03:41:54.560 --> 03:41:59.520]  by nothing other than the operation of term limits. He's going to be gone. And what do we
[03:41:59.520 --> 03:42:04.640]  got? We got a bunch of old people like me who don't matter because we're dying. The only people
[03:42:04.640 --> 03:42:10.400]  who matter are the young people. And half of the young people do not want the United States to
[03:42:10.400 --> 03:42:18.560]  continue. Do these revolutionaries, these self-appointed pro-revolutionaries, seriously expect
[03:42:18.560 --> 03:42:25.600]  me to violently attack my children, my grandchildren, and my great-grandchildren? Because if you do,
[03:42:26.640 --> 03:42:33.040]  I'm mistaken. I will not do it. Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Al. That's a long term of history.
[03:42:33.760 --> 03:42:38.880]  Yeah. And nobody's going to win in a civil war. And like you said, it usually winds up worse, you
[03:42:38.880 --> 03:42:45.920]  know. The French Revolution went from guillotines to Napoleon. And that seems to be a historical
[03:42:45.920 --> 03:42:49.200]  pattern. Anyway, we'll see you on the other side of the break.
[03:42:52.560 --> 03:42:57.520]  In the last few months, Info Wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory
[03:42:57.520 --> 03:43:00.960]  of many of our best-selling items. And then I came up with the idea last week, let's not
[03:43:00.960 --> 03:43:05.840]  just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50 to 75% off double-patriot points. Let's
[03:43:05.840 --> 03:43:13.280]  extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order. Even if it's a tube, a fluoride-free
[03:43:13.280 --> 03:43:19.440]  colloidal silver iodine, 4 to 5 super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt
[03:43:19.440 --> 03:43:23.440]  while supplies last. And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going
[03:43:23.440 --> 03:43:28.480]  to be selling out. So whatever you order that day, there'll be the shirt of the day that's there
[03:43:28.480 --> 03:43:32.400]  until it sells out. Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders. So
[03:43:32.400 --> 03:43:38.560]  in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had. So this is a loss
[03:43:38.560 --> 03:43:42.960]  leader. We are losing money on this. This is our biggest sale ever. Get your free gift, your free
[03:43:42.960 --> 03:43:48.160]  shipping, everything, and don't fight the crowds. InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or triple
[03:43:48.160 --> 03:43:54.640]  8253-3139. God bless you and thank you for your support. We all know that the outside toxins in
[03:43:54.640 --> 03:43:59.760]  the water is a serious health issue. Info Wars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost
[03:43:59.760 --> 03:44:04.880]  impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home. That's why we're bringing
[03:44:04.880 --> 03:44:10.000]  you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system. The Pro Pure Whole

[03:44:44.640 --> 03:44:50.080]  to replace your current rundown systems, it's time to go big and go home with the Pro Pure

[03:45:02.640 --> 03:45:06.960]  We've been proven dead on. You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this
[03:45:06.960 --> 03:45:12.560]  project. You've been the men and women in the arena, and I really do thank you and salute you. All
[03:45:12.560 --> 03:45:17.840]  words are not enough. Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political
[03:45:17.840 --> 03:45:22.720]  ideologies that you have been on target, promoting Americana and Renaissance,
[03:45:22.720 --> 03:45:27.840]  and open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force. They've created a tower
[03:45:27.840 --> 03:45:31.520]  of babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other, but we have cut
[03:45:31.520 --> 03:45:37.200]  right to the chase. Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future.
[03:45:37.200 --> 03:45:40.640]  And that's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that
[03:45:40.640 --> 03:45:45.600]  InfoWars really is your baby. I am in your hands, and we're under unprecedented attack,
[03:45:45.600 --> 03:45:49.680]  and we just need you to go to infowarsstore.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the
[03:45:49.680 --> 03:45:56.800]  best deals ever and funding InfoWars. A true 360 win. In the last few months, you have seen InfoWars
[03:45:56.800 --> 03:46:00.640]  offer the biggest sales in our history. Now we've sold out of some of our best-selling items,
[03:46:00.640 --> 03:46:04.880]  but we've still got most of our best-selling items in. That's why I am extending the 12
[03:46:04.880 --> 03:46:08.960]  Days of Christmas for four more days, because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able
[03:46:08.960 --> 03:46:13.680]  to ship to anybody in the continental United States before Christmas at infowarsstore.com.

[03:46:18.640 --> 03:46:24.720]  12 days, 50 to 75 percent off is back. Free shipping is still there. Double Patriot points,
[03:46:24.720 --> 03:46:29.440]  and we have even bigger sales on four new items. Vitamin Mineral Fusion,

[03:46:39.840 --> 03:46:44.480]  and thank you again all for your support. We're extending this sale until the 19th,
[03:46:44.480 --> 03:46:48.240]  but InfoWars is in your hands. And again, whatever you do, just spread the word about
[03:46:48.240 --> 03:46:51.360]  InfoWars.com, and we're going to beat the globals together. Thank you.
[03:47:18.560 --> 03:47:25.760]  You know, the great N. E. O. Morricone. What a genius. Anyway, I'm going to take the
[03:47:25.760 --> 03:47:30.480]  remaining calls in this last segment, and they're going to have to be short so I can get to everybody.
[03:47:30.480 --> 03:47:36.720]  And what I'll do is just let you make a comment, speak for a minute or two, and then we'll go
[03:47:36.720 --> 03:47:43.840]  to the next call. I see a Dr. Kelly in California. Are you there still? Dr. Kelly.
[03:47:43.840 --> 03:47:48.800]  Thank you so much for taking my call, and I will make it quick. I'd like to point out that
[03:47:48.800 --> 03:47:55.760]  the people that are senators such as Feinstein, Harris, and several of the politicians
[03:47:56.320 --> 03:48:03.120]  are sitting bar attorneys in their respective states. I'd like people to look into that and to
[03:48:03.120 --> 03:48:12.000]  expose that. And we've got Will Wagner, who exposed the original 13th Amendment from 1811.
[03:48:12.000 --> 03:48:16.800]  And there are so many wonderful works to read in your local law library,
[03:48:17.360 --> 03:48:22.080]  and document it, teach your kids, and thank you, Matt, for your work.
[03:48:23.920 --> 03:48:29.200]  Thank you. That whole vote harvesting thing out in Lawrence County, that's really got me freaked
[03:48:29.200 --> 03:48:35.600]  out. That's so Venezuelan. It's just almost beyond belief. Next, it's going to be, you know,
[03:48:35.600 --> 03:48:42.880]  people's cadres collecting the votes, filling them out for you. Matt in Ohio wants to talk about
[03:48:42.880 --> 03:48:48.960]  a coming crash. Matt, are you there? Hey, how's it going, Matt? Great. Thanks for holding.
[03:48:50.240 --> 03:48:54.480]  Oh, no problem. I just wanted to make a quick comment. I want to talk about the economic
[03:48:54.480 --> 03:49:03.840]  crash. Did you see the economist 2019 issue? No. I'll look for it, but go ahead. Yeah,
[03:49:03.840 --> 03:49:07.280]  it shows a picture with Trump's face on there, and then it shows like a graph over them, you know,
[03:49:07.280 --> 03:49:12.080]  like they're hitting at a economic crash. And then it also shows like, you know, a picture of a
[03:49:12.080 --> 03:49:16.800]  painter bear representing China, and it shows, you know, a thing about Brexit, it shows a thing
[03:49:16.800 --> 03:49:22.400]  about Putin and the four horsemen and all kinds of stuff. It even shows stuff about, you know,
[03:49:22.400 --> 03:49:29.120]  the transhumanism movement, where it's a stork holding, you know, a bag with a barcode over it.
[03:49:29.120 --> 03:49:34.000]  So, you know, they are really planning something this upcoming year, you know, it's going to get
[03:49:34.000 --> 03:49:38.880]  pretty crazy. And they even have the marijuana, a guy holding the marijuana thing. So I believe
[03:49:38.880 --> 03:49:43.200]  that they're going to start even injecting stuff in this marijuana that they're making legal, you
[03:49:43.200 --> 03:49:48.160]  know, to dumb down the culture even more than what it already is, you know, it's crazy times
[03:49:48.160 --> 03:49:52.000]  we're in, but, you know, we just got to trust in God. And, you know, I just wanted to make that
[03:49:52.000 --> 03:50:00.160]  quick comment. Yeah, legalization almost seems like brave new world's Soma, you know, just
[03:50:00.160 --> 03:50:07.440]  keep the population stoned and happy, feed them on virtual reality, you know, video games, etc.
[03:50:08.000 --> 03:50:13.920]  Now we're seeing kids have their brains rewired, you know, with the, with the smartphones, they're,
[03:50:13.920 --> 03:50:19.840]  they're literally becoming stupid because they're hooked into an information machine from big
[03:50:19.840 --> 03:50:26.080]  from toddler age. Instead of their brain learning to be inquisitive about the world,
[03:50:26.080 --> 03:50:32.080]  the brain is just fed messages. And they, they look at brain, children's brains now and they're,
[03:50:32.080 --> 03:50:36.640]  they're being ruined from a young age, making them into perfect slaves, I would, I would think.
[03:50:37.760 --> 03:50:44.800]  Let's see, who do we have up here for a while? James in California. Go ahead, James.
[03:50:44.800 --> 03:50:50.880]  How's it going? I'm going to keep it real short. I'm on the front lines here of California. I'm a
[03:50:50.880 --> 03:50:57.920]  29 year old in Sacramento, Citrus Heights area. My name's Jimmy Bazzalian. Let's take it back to
[03:50:57.920 --> 03:51:04.720]  1776. Our fathers, our founding fathers are men and women fought like the savage Indians,
[03:51:04.720 --> 03:51:09.840]  like to call it guerrilla warfare. As the red coach said, lined up, we just did a headshot
[03:51:09.840 --> 03:51:16.240]  after headshot. And I don't, I want to keep this peaceful. I think it's important that we do guerrilla
[03:51:16.240 --> 03:51:22.400]  advertising. I'm sure every person listening to this right now has a fence board or some sort of
[03:51:22.400 --> 03:51:25.840]  piece of wood and some paint laying around the house. It's as simple as taking a drill
[03:51:27.120 --> 03:51:33.360]  and some screws, paying your rights onto a board and getting your information out that way.
[03:51:33.360 --> 03:51:38.160]  Cause we all know we're being censored on Google Facebook. That will in turn go viral.
[03:51:38.160 --> 03:51:45.760]  You know mainstream media will love to cover this. We're all out. An injury to one of us is an
[03:51:45.760 --> 03:51:49.520]  injury to all of us. Keep your chin in your chest down and be proud to be an American.
[03:51:50.720 --> 03:51:56.880]  Yeah. I think guerrilla marketing of ideas can be very effective. Like the, um, it's okay to be
[03:51:56.880 --> 03:52:03.760]  white. Uh, messages totally freak out the, uh, the leftists, simple things like that. Um,
[03:52:03.760 --> 03:52:12.880]  um, let me see, uh, we've got, uh, Liberty Smith in Oklahoma, Liberty Smith, cool name.
[03:52:12.880 --> 03:52:20.160]  Uh, go ahead, Smith. Hey, man. How are you today? Great. Thanks. You haven't been real encouraging
[03:52:20.160 --> 03:52:28.160]  today, but that's okay. Cause I understand trust me on this one. Um, you know, I had several,
[03:52:28.160 --> 03:52:36.160]  several thoughts, but the biggest one for me is, as I live in a rural area in rural Oklahoma, uh,
[03:52:36.160 --> 03:52:45.200]  I work in a, uh, 50,000. You know, people town and they're basically all conservatives, but
[03:52:45.840 --> 03:52:53.920]  about 70% of Oklahoma is, but one thing I noticed is, is nobody in this town in Arbor, Oklahoma
[03:52:53.920 --> 03:53:00.240]  has a sign up for Trump has anything up, but you'll see all the liberals, they got all their crap up.
[03:53:00.960 --> 03:53:10.000]  And, uh, the thing I'm wondering about is, is how can I, as a 61 year old with 11 grandchildren,
[03:53:10.000 --> 03:53:15.600]  do more than what I'm already doing? And you know, I call the white house. I email the,
[03:53:15.600 --> 03:53:21.280]  the president and congressman and everything else. And I do it about once a week or twice a,
[03:53:21.280 --> 03:53:28.240]  twice a month or whatever. And I want to do more. I am restless. I am sick of this crap.
[03:53:29.040 --> 03:53:35.520]  And I think, you know, the audience, the info warriors are too. So my question is,
[03:53:35.520 --> 03:53:42.640]  is rural America older, loves our country, loves my children and grandchildren. What else can I do?
[03:53:44.800 --> 03:53:48.560]  I don't know, but I, when you drive around that your vehicle is going to be seen,
[03:53:48.560 --> 03:53:53.920]  I like the idea of these magnetic info where stickers, and you can also get full sized sheets
[03:53:53.920 --> 03:53:59.520]  of, it's like the refrigerator magnet material. Then you can stick a Trump bumper sticker or any
[03:53:59.520 --> 03:54:03.760]  other bumper sticker on it, but you're not committed to it. If you're afraid your car's
[03:54:03.760 --> 03:54:07.840]  going to get heat in certain areas, but when you're just driving around in normal life,
[03:54:07.840 --> 03:54:11.760]  you can put any message you want on your, on your vehicle and take it off when you want.
[03:54:12.320 --> 03:54:17.440]  Um, and I'm, I'm the same age and it is, it's pretty discouraging. It's almost
[03:54:17.440 --> 03:54:22.640]  feels like we have no voice. I eventually might come to some kind of a yellow vest movement in
[03:54:22.640 --> 03:54:29.200]  America, you know, with taking to the streets, but you know, in the USA, mostly it's, um,
[03:54:29.200 --> 03:54:34.000]  urban versus rural and eventually it becomes the civil war. You know, they don't grow food in the
[03:54:34.000 --> 03:54:41.040]  cities. It's just something to keep in mind. Um, uh, maybe last call, Gary in Texas says,
[03:54:41.040 --> 03:54:48.640]  when is it time? Gary in Texas, go ahead. Yes, sir. I think you've taken my call. My question
[03:54:48.640 --> 03:54:57.040]  is when do you know it's time? When do you know it's time? Well, I think that as, as long as, uh,
[03:54:57.600 --> 03:55:02.880]  we're able to, um, have this show, for example, you know, well, while we're still broadcasting,
[03:55:02.880 --> 03:55:09.120]  even on, maybe you could say reduced volume since, um, you know, since info wars has been
[03:55:09.120 --> 03:55:16.400]  largely banned from, uh, mainstream broadcasting on YouTube and so forth, uh, when, when you see
[03:55:16.400 --> 03:55:23.200]  voices like Alex Jones and my own and others going silent, that will be a big clue that the
[03:55:23.200 --> 03:55:28.720]  time is getting close. But really, I don't, I don't, there won't be any kind of, uh, revolution in
[03:55:28.720 --> 03:55:34.720]  this country as long as, uh, food supply is going, electricity is flowing. It's not going to happen
[03:55:34.720 --> 03:55:40.640]  just for political reasons. It won't happen until there's a real pinch, you know, an economic collapse,
[03:55:40.640 --> 03:55:45.600]  food distribution breaks down. When that happens, all hell is going to break loose.
[03:55:45.600 --> 03:55:50.720]  And, uh, unfortunately, I think that that's inevitable at some point, especially with the
[03:55:50.720 --> 03:55:57.360]  Democrats, um, basically they're globalists. They want to change America fundamentally,
[03:55:57.360 --> 03:56:03.760]  as Obama put it, make it just another third world country because Democrats actually love
[03:56:03.760 --> 03:56:08.800]  ruling third world countries. Look at any, look at Chicago, Baltimore, Philadelphia,
[03:56:09.360 --> 03:56:15.200]  any of the cities that the Democrats have ruled for generations are a microcosm of a third world
[03:56:15.200 --> 03:56:21.280]  country. And they don't care if the people are hungry, if crime is out of control. Look at Maxine
[03:56:21.280 --> 03:56:27.200]  Walker, she lived in a $4 million mansion. You know, her district is mostly, uh, very poor people.
[03:56:27.200 --> 03:56:32.000]  She lives out of the district in the mansion. So the Democrats don't care if the country is ruined
[03:56:32.000 --> 03:56:37.440]  as long as they're ruling it. They don't mind ruling the ruins. So I don't think there's,
[03:56:37.440 --> 03:56:42.480]  there's going to be anything like a real civil war until all of this, uh, eventually collapses
[03:56:42.480 --> 03:56:47.760]  in a heap and the country has an economy like Venezuela. That's when it's going to, that's
[03:56:47.760 --> 03:56:53.920]  when the, uh, that's when the, uh, uh, S is going to hit the fan for sure. But as long as people
[03:56:53.920 --> 03:57:00.720]  have their smartphones, TDs, video games, uh, refrigerators full, then there's not going to be
[03:57:00.720 --> 03:57:05.200]  anything happening. We're just going to be grinding our teeth and, uh, and, uh, you know,
[03:57:05.200 --> 03:57:11.760]  wailing to each other here on, on, uh, you know, the internet and social media, but eventually
[03:57:11.760 --> 03:57:17.760]  where it, where it happens is when it refrigerators empty and there are no more food trucks coming.
[03:57:18.320 --> 03:57:22.880]  That's when that that's going to be the final sign. Well, it's been fun taking calls this,
[03:57:22.880 --> 03:57:29.440]  um, last hour of the week when info wars and I'll, uh, see you next week or sometime in the future.
[03:57:29.440 --> 03:57:36.640]  And maybe then I'll be more cheerful, but, uh, Merry Christmas to the info info wars army and
[03:57:36.640 --> 03:57:47.840]  keep fighting, never give up, never surrender. We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our
[03:57:47.840 --> 03:57:53.360]  freedom. Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper. It consists
[03:57:53.360 --> 03:57:57.520]  of the things that we're willing to fight for. The first amendment, the bill of rights, the rest
[03:57:57.520 --> 03:58:03.440]  of the bill of rights are prohibitions. They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and
[03:58:03.440 --> 03:58:08.560]  individuals taking those God given rights from us as individuals. You better understand that
[03:58:08.560 --> 03:58:15.920]  because they're taking them right now. We have seen what they want to do. They called it UN
[03:58:15.920 --> 03:58:21.840]  Agenda 21. Now they call it the UN 2030 agenda. They want everybody off of the rural lands. They
[03:58:21.840 --> 03:58:26.880]  want people out of the suburbs. They want to pack everybody into the cities because that's
[03:58:26.880 --> 03:58:33.520]  where it is easiest for them to control everyone. It's the David Knight show. Never missed your
[03:58:33.520 --> 03:58:46.880]  show any day. At info wars.com forward slash show. Everybody knows that history documents it,
[03:58:46.880 --> 03:58:51.920]  but there is a cult in every culture and every system throughout history that wants to hurt
[03:58:51.920 --> 03:58:56.480]  children. They want to abort children. They want to disease children. They want to abuse children.
[03:58:56.480 --> 03:59:00.800]  They want to confuse children. They want their essence. They want their soul. They want their
[03:59:00.800 --> 03:59:07.120]  spirit. They want their power because they are our future. And this Christmas, remember, it is
[03:59:07.120 --> 03:59:12.400]  about Jesus Christ, that ultimate sacrifice. It is about the West. It is about a human future
[03:59:12.400 --> 03:59:16.320]  and standing with each other and believing in a better future. So I want to thank you all for
[03:59:16.320 --> 03:59:21.760]  your support, but I want to ask you all to pray for your own family, to pray for America, to play
[03:59:21.760 --> 03:59:28.080]  for President Trump, and to pray for info wars, and to remember that you have the power to change
[03:59:28.080 --> 03:59:32.880]  the world. You have the power to override the sensors. You have the power to stop the globalist
[03:59:32.880 --> 03:59:37.520]  dead in their tracks. I know you've been taken action. I salute you, but just remember, I know
[03:59:37.520 --> 03:59:42.800]  you're humble, but just remember you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[03:59:42.800 --> 03:59:51.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
