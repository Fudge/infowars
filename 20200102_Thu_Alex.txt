[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:25.000 --> 00:41.000]  Here we are, Thursday, January 2nd, 2020, 305 days out from this referendum on Americanism versus Globalism.
[00:41.000 --> 00:44.000]  I am your host, and I'm very, very honored to be here.
[00:44.000 --> 00:52.000]  I'm very, very thankful for all of you, the viewers, the listeners, everyone that makes this transmission possible, our amazing crew, our sponsors, our families,
[00:52.000 --> 01:00.000]  all of us here at the M4 are a family who want to stand up against the globalists who are trying to break our will and demoralize us.
[01:00.000 --> 01:07.000]  Well, I am very excited right now in good ways and in bad ways.
[01:07.000 --> 01:19.000]  There has been a major move to foment civil war in this country, and Soros got caught trying to do that back in 2015 with Obama.
[01:19.000 --> 01:23.000]  We have those secret documents. They also got caught trying to trigger that.
[01:23.000 --> 01:37.000]  Obviously, in Charlottesville right after Trump got into office as well, and now Virginia is moving forward this month to try to implement laws to begin gun confiscation.
[01:37.000 --> 01:44.000]  And admitting they want to use the military to do it, the Democrats are saying, hell yes, we want to take all your semi-automatic weapons.
[01:44.000 --> 01:54.000]  Remember when Beto O'Rourke famously said that, every Democrat candidate on the stage, except Tulsi Gabbards, agreed with that.
[01:54.000 --> 02:02.000]  So that's a consensus. We have the New York Times and the Boston Globe saying time to repeal the Second Amendment.
[02:02.000 --> 02:10.000]  Well, Tom Papert's national file, excellent news site, a lot of former Breitbart people and others, has been doing amazing research.
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.000]  But this was public knowledge that they broke on Monday that we covered here.
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.000]  But it didn't get a lot of attention until the last 24 hours. Now it's a top trending story.
[02:20.000 --> 02:25.000]  DrudgeReport.com has linked an article on Infowars.com.
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.000]  Why is the UN hiring English-speaking disarmament officers in New York?
[02:30.000 --> 02:40.000]  And then it points out that the UN confiscates guns all over the world and in a UN treaty that Obama signed on to, but Congress didn't ratify,
[02:40.000 --> 02:47.000]  it says civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.000]  Well, that's a true statement, except power monopolies aren't legitimate, are they?
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  North Korea has a power monopoly. China under Xi Jinping has a power monopoly.
[02:56.000 --> 03:05.000]  The FÃ¼hrer in Nazi Germany, Adolf Alois Hitler had a power monopoly and those weren't good things.
[03:05.000 --> 03:12.000]  But now this is getting picked up all over the place by major publications and others that are looking into it and saying this is crazy
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.000]  and we have the Democrats admitting they want paramilitary to take the guns.
[03:18.000 --> 03:27.000]  And there is a scenario to cause a civil war in America and then use that crisis to bring in the UN, Loretta Lynch,
[03:27.000 --> 03:33.000]  and her Strong Cities initiative right before Obama left office four years ago.
[03:33.000 --> 03:41.000]  Proposed and we played the audio and video of them at meetings when they have these federal takeover of police departments
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.000]  to quote, fix corruption, that the UN would do it.
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.000]  And remember, the UN goes into countries all over the world and does this when they're having civil wars.
[03:50.000 --> 03:57.000]  That's why they're building refugee centers in Mexico and Guatemala and flooding us just like they're doing it on the borders of Europe with the Islamists.
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.000]  That's what the UN is bringing people in by the tens of thousands from the Congo during the biggest Ebola outbreak ever.
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  It's all part of the globalist using the third world to assault the first world.
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.000]  The UN and the globalists have already exploited the third world. China has taken over Africa.
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  That was a big article we covered just a few days ago.
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.000]  And now they're moving against the United States.
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.000]  But America woke up in the last few minutes to midnight.
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  And so now the fight is on.
[04:24.000 --> 04:31.000]  In fact, crew, please print me that big article that was linked on drugs a few days ago about China taking over the continent of Africa.
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  That integrates with this and I forgot to get into that.
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  So that's all coming up.
[04:35.000 --> 04:42.000]  We have the reporter and the journalist that broke the big story, Tom Pappert, joining us and so much more.
[04:42.000 --> 04:48.000]  We also have big news on the Vatican with Leo Zagami and more today.
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, Paul Watson from the UK.
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.000]  We'll also be hosting the fourth hour. It's 2020. Stay with us.
[04:59.000 --> 05:01.000]  Andy in Florida. Thank you, Andy. Go ahead.
[05:01.000 --> 05:04.000]  Hey, Alex. I love you, man. We love you.
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.000]  Before I go ahead and talk about the topic on hand, I got to talk about one of your products.
[05:08.000 --> 05:10.000]  A little bit about me. I'm 245 pounds.
[05:10.000 --> 05:14.000]  I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS and make a long story short.
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.000]  I used to have a problem with Adderall.
[05:16.000 --> 05:21.000]  I do have ADHD, but, you know, I was taking Adderall for its energy boosting properties.
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.000]  You know, I kind of got a little out of hand and, you know, I listen to you religiously in my truck every day.
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  So I tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche.
[05:28.000 --> 05:31.000]  This product changed my life, but turbo force really changed my life.
[05:31.000 --> 05:38.000]  It was a day I'd no longer take Adderall and I get by literally the 13 hours a day I work on a half of a packet of your turbo force.
[05:38.000 --> 05:45.000]  And if you take a half a packet, that's literally a dollar a day and you save so much money versus, you know, a monster, which is what, 499.
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  And, you know, I just had to call and tell you guys how great turbo force is.
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  And if anybody's on the fence, they really have to try it.
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  We're really proud of turbo force. So thank you, sir.
[05:53.000 --> 05:55.000]  Commit to buy a lot of your products at M4store.com.
[05:55.000 --> 05:58.000]  Then help us spread the word. Let's just get busy at M4store.com.
[05:58.000 --> 06:00.000]  M4store.com.
[06:00.000 --> 06:02.000]  We've got it.
[06:07.000 --> 06:09.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[06:11.000 --> 06:17.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[06:19.000 --> 06:21.000]  How we see the earth.
[06:22.000 --> 06:23.000]  We've got it.
[06:25.000 --> 06:27.000]  How we see the earth.
[06:27.000 --> 06:29.000]  We've got the earth now.
[06:29.000 --> 06:33.000]  And it is the mythical years.
[06:33.000 --> 06:34.000]  You've got it.
[06:34.000 --> 06:35.000]  2020.
[06:35.000 --> 06:41.000]  I remember growing up being four or five years old and my mother cooking in the kitchen.
[06:43.000 --> 06:49.000]  She said, just think you'll be 20 something years old in the year 2000.
[06:49.000 --> 06:54.000]  I thought about 2000 being some distant future place like the Jetsons,
[06:54.000 --> 06:58.000]  and we'd all fly to work on cloud cities on our jetpacks.
[07:00.000 --> 07:03.000]  And then the year 2000 came and went.
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.000]  2001, the beginning of the new millennium.
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.000]  And just like that, here we are 20 years later.
[07:13.000 --> 07:23.000]  In the year 2020, that image of vision, that archetypal symbol,
[07:25.000 --> 07:34.000]  and the world is matching what you'd expect from such an incredible numerical iconography.
[07:34.000 --> 07:39.000]  Big things are happening.
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.000]  Still, greater things are going to unfold.
[07:42.000 --> 07:48.000]  And the world has been put into that point of liquefaction,
[07:48.000 --> 07:55.000]  where the system has been frozen in the social mores and how culture operates.
[07:55.000 --> 08:05.000]  And it has been artificially put into flocks.
[08:05.000 --> 08:11.000]  So the social engineers can manipulate society into a form and shape they desire.
[08:11.000 --> 08:18.000]  But during that critical moment where civilization is put into flocks,
[08:18.000 --> 08:22.000]  we are now fighting with the technocrats and the posthumanists
[08:22.000 --> 08:30.000]  for control of the wheel that is in direct connection to the rudder.
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.000]  And that's the best analogy I can come up with.
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.000]  I think it's probably best that I just read to you some of the stacks
[08:39.000 --> 08:43.000]  and some of the headlines here that we're going to be going over today.
[08:43.000 --> 08:49.000]  The public has really woken up to the fact that the stage is being set
[08:49.000 --> 08:59.000]  to trigger controlled right-wing opposition clashes
[08:59.000 --> 09:08.000]  with controlled left-wing opposition antifa in areas like Virginia.
[09:08.000 --> 09:16.000]  And that indeed the United Nations is being prepared and being augmented
[09:16.000 --> 09:22.000]  and firing up the forces to be able to carry out that stabilization role
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.000]  if criminal elements of the deep state are indeed able to trigger civil unrest
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.000]  inside the United States.
[09:31.000 --> 09:37.000]  It is so wonderful that everyone is seeing through this
[09:37.000 --> 09:42.000]  and how phony Charlottesville was a few years ago as a beta test
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.000]  of how they were going to try to create these clashes in the future
[09:46.000 --> 09:53.000]  that they hope will trigger and detonate real clashes across the United States.
[09:53.000 --> 10:01.000]  And I've had the University of Georgetown and the deep state publicly sue me
[10:01.000 --> 10:05.000]  and misrepresent what I've said and what I've done about Charlottesville
[10:05.000 --> 10:11.000]  in an attempt to silence us and others to talk about how they're trying to create these clashes.
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.000]  But instead, we're going to focus more on it now
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.000]  and have our people in place coming up on the 20th of the Commonwealth
[10:20.000 --> 10:26.000]  when they announced gun confiscation and registration, which they've already said they're going to do,
[10:26.000 --> 10:36.000]  in an attempt to trigger clashes, which again, Soros and his operatives have been caught doing before.
[10:36.000 --> 10:42.000]  That's why Joe Biden is running his new campaign ad saying we're going to have a new Charlottesville
[10:42.000 --> 10:50.000]  and Trump is defending the KKK saying they're very fine people, which he never said, another hoax.
[10:50.000 --> 11:03.000]  That's because they plan to use a new clash as a way to again trigger civil unrest across the nation
[11:03.000 --> 11:16.000]  and then bring in the UN that Obama proposed using in U.S. cities where there, quote, have been police abuses.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  That was proposed by Loretta Lynch.
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  We played the clip here many times.
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.000]  Breitbart.com, infowars.com wrote about it.
[11:23.000 --> 11:30.000]  Her at meetings telling city leaders across the country, we're going to use the UN over the police boards.
[11:30.000 --> 11:38.000]  And the UN builds the refugee centers on our borders and the UN runs all these major operations to break up countries.
[11:38.000 --> 11:45.000]  And that's how the globalists are going to try to use these outside forces against the attempt by Trump and the American people
[11:45.000 --> 11:52.000]  to restore our republic, unify our nation and move forward.
[11:52.000 --> 12:01.000]  Just like the Russiagate failed, just like the impeachment is a big joke, I believe this is going to fail because we're on air
[12:01.000 --> 12:05.000]  because you are active and because you understand their game plan.
[12:05.000 --> 12:12.000]  Once we understand their game plan, it is game over.
[12:12.000 --> 12:26.000]  So I'm going to spend the entire second hour looking at scenarios that the deep state has been preparing
[12:26.000 --> 12:34.000]  and are intending to implement, not just in Virginia, but in other geographic areas of the U.S.
[12:34.000 --> 12:44.000]  Economic crises they're planning and other tricks, but knowing about their operations is a large part of the battle.
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  And we've done extensive research.
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  This entire stack is government documents, admissions, plans.
[12:50.000 --> 12:55.000]  No one, no one has their finger on the pulse like we do.
[12:55.000 --> 13:06.000]  And I don't say that again to toot our horn, I say it to point out that this is the battle plans.
[13:06.000 --> 13:16.000]  And if you know the enemy's plans and if you're able to get those out to patriots in government, in companies, in private life,
[13:16.000 --> 13:25.000]  and to the independent press, and if we know what we're looking for, we understand the narrative, we don't have to sleepwalk into their takeover.
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.000]  And that's why they're pissed that we just don't follow their brainwashing and their narratives.
[13:30.000 --> 13:37.000]  But the big stories are up on DrudgeReport.com, infowars.com, Virginia Rep says she's military to take the guns.
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.000]  Why is the U.N. hiring English-speaking disarmament officers in New York?
[13:41.000 --> 13:48.000]  Leaked U.S. Army Document Outlines Plan for Re-education Camps in America, FM3-39.40.
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.000]  All of this, Virginia Governor wants roadblocks to take the guns.
[13:53.000 --> 13:58.000]  That's meant to cause a civil war.
[13:58.000 --> 14:03.000]  It's just like Texas, the cities have been taken over by people fleeing California.
[14:03.000 --> 14:08.000]  So you go into the cities, it's not Texas anymore, but then outside the cities, it is Texas.
[14:08.000 --> 14:13.000]  And imagine if they just shut the roads down and start confiscating your guns, they know that's going to cause a revolt.
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.000]  That's their plan. This is so huge.
[14:17.000 --> 14:24.000]  So we're going to cover it. The entire second hour, tell everybody to tune in, is on this, okay?
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.000]  Beyond critical, beyond critical.
[14:27.000 --> 14:32.000]  Now, we come back. I want to look at the race war component that ties into this first.
[14:32.000 --> 14:38.000]  Trump list shows 319 results and promises he kept. Huge surveillance grid news.
[14:38.000 --> 14:43.000]  The latest campaign news. Huge news that ties into all of that in the deep state.
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.000]  Obama's National Security Council holdovers finally fired by Trump.
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.000]  So Trump is doing a lot of very exciting things.
[14:51.000 --> 14:57.000]  We're seeing real movement in the new year that if it follows the trajectory I see,
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  we're going to see the deep state in really big trouble in about 60 days.
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  But we will track all of that as well and the latest in the Middle East
[15:06.000 --> 15:13.000]  as the deep state tries to trigger a new hostage crisis to embarrass Trump and derail his attempts at peace in the Middle East.
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  It's all coming up finally in this segment.
[15:18.000 --> 15:24.000]  We will never have deals as good as we've had at the end of 2019 and the start of this year because
[15:24.000 --> 15:30.000]  we are clearing out of a lot of our inventory, even our best-selling items
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.000]  to be able to restock and then once we restock, we're not going to be able to do the 60, 70% off on things
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.000]  because there's no profit there. So the best deals ever are at infowarstore.com.
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  They're only running for four more days and then that's it.

[17:23.000 --> 17:30.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[17:30.000 --> 17:34.000]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[17:34.000 --> 17:40.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[17:40.000 --> 17:44.000]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[17:59.000 --> 18:08.000]  Infowars has delivered. Infowars has come through time and time and time and time again.
[18:08.000 --> 18:24.000]  At that critical game-changing moment we have come through and that means myself, the other hosts, the journalists, the researchers, the writers, the crew, down to the janitor, down to the bookkeeper.

[18:58.000 --> 19:05.000]  I've got a problem that I want to confess to the listeners and viewers.
[19:05.000 --> 19:19.000]  I've been on the air so long that I take it for granted now when we break some massive story that changes the whole world and that really does great things for the future of not just our children, but our children's children.
[19:19.000 --> 19:26.000]  Infowars really has changed history. And that's why I need to pull back and ask the listeners, because I know you're a lot like me,
[19:26.000 --> 19:29.000]  to really think about a world without Infowars.
[19:29.000 --> 19:39.000]  Because I can tell you right now, if people don't really step up to the plate and really financially support our broadcast going into 2020, we're not going to be on the air in a year or so.
[19:39.000 --> 19:47.000]  If you do support us, we're not just going to stay on the air, but we are going to expand in ways that are going to blow you away.
[19:47.000 --> 19:58.000]  I've never let you down, you've never let me down. Step up to the plate now, go to infowarsstore.com, buy great products and funder operation and watch us make history together again.
[20:18.000 --> 20:28.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[20:28.000 --> 20:34.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[20:34.000 --> 21:03.000]  Again, it is Thursday, January 2nd, 2020. I'm your host, Alex Jones, and in this second hour, I'm going to lay out the Democrats' surprise to try to derail Trump.
[21:03.000 --> 21:13.000]  It's guaranteed. They admit it's their plan. We said two years ago it was their plan. We said it was their plan a year ago. We said it six months ago.
[21:13.000 --> 21:26.000]  And now Joe Biden is betting his whole campaign on a new Charlottesville, and the Democrats are coming to confiscate the guns in Virginia.
[21:26.000 --> 21:35.000]  And they are so pissed that we see right through them, and they just don't know what to do.
[21:35.000 --> 21:43.000]  The Domino's are falling in our direction. We're winning. And those of us that are on the front lines are going to be punished. That's okay.
[21:43.000 --> 21:52.000]  That's what I signed up for here. But I want the audience to realize you're not an audience. You are literally the reason this is happening.
[21:52.000 --> 22:00.000]  Think about that. Info Wars is the tip of the spear. And we are responsible, but God's help for all of this. That means you.
[22:00.000 --> 22:16.000]  Okay, let me do this, because the news is so overwhelming. The only way I can process this is just tell you what's coming up, and then I'm going to explode into this at the start of the next segment.
[22:16.000 --> 22:25.000]  I got into how we have their game plan. It's confirmed they're moving forward with it to trigger Civil War.
[22:25.000 --> 22:32.000]  We have the documents where they admit that's their plan. It's incredible.
[22:32.000 --> 22:51.000]  And then we've got the foaming towards that. And after they trigger the clash in Virginia and other areas with their hired actors, with their operatives, and the real useful idiots that show up,
[22:51.000 --> 23:03.000]  they then plan to trigger racial unrest around the country and brand the overthrow of Trump as an uprising by non whites against whites.
[23:03.000 --> 23:15.000]  And that's why there's more than 15 Netflix shows and HBO shows and just everywhere about white privilege and how whites are inherently evil and bad.
[23:15.000 --> 23:33.000]  With white people teaching everyone this is a case and Barack Obama as a producer, financing and producing shows with names like white privilege.
[23:33.000 --> 23:48.000]  Protests after German state broadcaster features children singing about their grandparents being environmentalist pigs and chanting like Nazis that they're going to get them and line them up against the wall with Greta Thunberg in the background.
[23:48.000 --> 23:52.000]  Yes, this is not science fiction. This is 2020.
[23:52.000 --> 24:04.000]  As I mentioned the racial division. New York Times loves racism and hates white people. Big RT article ties into this. It's okay to be white trends on Twitter.
[24:04.000 --> 24:11.000]  New York Times begins 2020 with feature story on how white people are bad for existing.
[24:11.000 --> 24:20.000]  Paul Watson covered one that actually said, when you hike in Scotland, it's very upsetting to see so many able bodied white people.
[24:20.000 --> 24:26.000]  Even in Scotland, you can't have any white people plus they're good looking.
[24:26.000 --> 24:35.000]  And it's a white writer for the BBC who's upset to see able bodied white men.
[24:35.000 --> 24:40.000]  My God, that's a good looking white man. What are we going to do?
[24:40.000 --> 24:53.000]  This is the real world, folks. Open up Europe, bring in unlimited people. And then the white people are trying to teach them to hate the whites as a demographic takeover.
[24:53.000 --> 24:56.000]  Unbelievable. That's coming up.
[24:56.000 --> 25:06.000]  Meanwhile, Yale offering bouncy castle cookies and coloring activities for students, adult students encouraged to play children's games.
[25:06.000 --> 25:16.000]  We'll break all of it down. Meanwhile, many human Brussels is cars torched over 200 arrested the Islamic fun time.
[25:16.000 --> 25:24.000]  So we're going to break all of that down here today and we've got more of the big fake news.
[25:24.000 --> 25:31.000]  The Washington Post protesters storm US Embassy in Baghdad. Turns out they killed people now.
[25:31.000 --> 25:42.000]  But they're being called protesters, kind of what they called Xi Xi being a hero and said, quote, we hope China can destroy Trump to save America.
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.000]  That was the headline.
[25:45.000 --> 25:51.000]  Talk about collaborators, talk about enemies and a large part of the American people hate their own country so much.
[25:51.000 --> 25:56.000]  They don't want Trump to get them a better trade deal. They don't want to have a better energy prices. They don't want to have a future.
[25:56.000 --> 26:01.000]  Xi's choice, destroy Trump, save him and weaken America.
[26:01.000 --> 26:09.000]  Here's your headline. That's not the Twilight Zone. That's the real world in 2020.
[26:09.000 --> 26:18.000]  Meanwhile, the use of the new taxpayer funded benefits illegal aliens in California get starting today. We'll cover it.
[26:18.000 --> 26:25.000]  Trump on war with Iran. I like peace. Trump says he doesn't want war with Iran. That's coming up.
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.000]  Trump lists 319 results and promises kept in three years. He sure did.
[26:30.000 --> 26:36.000]  More honest and got more done than any president I've ever seen since George Washington, quite frankly.
[26:36.000 --> 26:45.000]  X FBI Chief Andrew McCabe lied to the FBI over his leak to the media. It's now coming out. Of course, we already knew that.
[26:45.000 --> 26:50.000]  California's woke legislation for 2020. Students can't be suspended.
[26:50.000 --> 26:58.000]  Left to Claire 2020. Year of the resistance to Donald Trump and Boris Johnson and call for their physical overthrow and who's financing them.
[26:58.000 --> 27:02.000]  George and Alexander Soros.
[27:02.000 --> 27:13.000]  Meanwhile, the Washington Post has written a big article that sounds like Paul Watson or Alex Jones wrote it 18 years ago.
[27:13.000 --> 27:27.000]  How we survived the surveillance apocalypse. Oh, it says your toasters listening to you that there's hidden cameras and microphones, even in cheap devices.
[27:27.000 --> 27:37.000]  And now the creepy unexplained drones swarming over everything at night in Colorado. We happen to know actually who's doing that. I'll tell you.
[27:37.000 --> 27:44.000]  Meanwhile, head of robotics company warns of catastrophic consequences of AI is used in conflicts.
[27:44.000 --> 27:50.000]  It's all coming up and the big news that ties in to evidence Trump's really moving now that the New Year's here.
[27:50.000 --> 27:57.000]  Obama National Security Council holdovers finally booted after years of nonstop leaks. We've got that.
[27:57.000 --> 28:04.000]  Julian Castro drops out a bunch of election news. Remember, he said we need abortions for men.
[28:04.000 --> 28:09.000]  And women can be sperm donors. Again, assaulting reality. That's all coming up.
[28:09.000 --> 28:13.000]  U.S. combat deaths in Afghanistan highest in years.
[28:13.000 --> 28:20.000]  And we'll talk about what was the number one most downloaded and viewed media event.
[28:20.000 --> 28:26.000]  On the open Internet in 2019. Well, it was Alex Jones, the Joe Rogan podcast, big articles about it.
[28:26.000 --> 28:32.000]  And that's why I can't go on any big shows that would get their top ratings because you're not allowed to have top ratings.
[28:32.000 --> 28:38.000]  You're not allowed to be number one. Sound like Ford versus Ferrari where they tell the Ford driver, it's a true story.
[28:38.000 --> 28:42.000]  They said, you need to slow the car down. You're three laps ahead of everybody.
[28:42.000 --> 28:52.000]  And we're going to, you know, just as it works. So again, they'll be right back in full wars.com, news wars.com, band.video,
[28:52.000 --> 28:58.000]  where the information too powerful for you to be allowed to see still exists like a Sentinel.
[28:58.000 --> 29:04.000]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[29:04.000 --> 29:13.000]  I had a problem like you once. I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[29:13.000 --> 29:18.000]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[29:18.000 --> 29:26.000]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[29:26.000 --> 29:33.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[29:33.000 --> 29:38.000]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[29:38.000 --> 29:59.000]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse. Get clean. Call now and learn more.
[29:59.000 --> 30:07.000]  We're closing out the year 2019. I don't have to tell you that 2020 is going to be a maker to break it.
[30:07.000 --> 30:10.000]  Not just for M4, not just for America, but the whole world.
[30:10.000 --> 30:16.000]  We are in a battle between the forces of globalism that want to post-human world and those that want to pro-human world.
[30:16.000 --> 30:24.000]  We're in a fight between Satan and Christ and it's being played out amongst us mortals, but it's being directed from on high.
[30:24.000 --> 30:30.000]  And I'm just telling the listeners this broadcast, without you, we're going to lose this fight.
[30:30.000 --> 30:35.000]  I need all of you to realize how important you are and how important M4s is and what we've done together.
[30:35.000 --> 30:41.000]  And just take stock and take measure at the end of the year and think about what you're going to do.
[30:41.000 --> 30:47.000]  Whether it's supporting M4s or buying products from us or starting your own show, just whatever you do, take action now.
[30:47.000 --> 30:54.000]  History is happening. Please do your Christmas shopping. Please do your New Year's shopping at M4store.com.
[30:54.000 --> 30:58.000]  We've got the best products. You're only helping the globalists if you don't do it. Thank you.
[30:58.000 --> 31:04.000]  A little less than four months ago, I made the announcement on air.
[31:04.000 --> 31:14.000]  I said, hey, I have a tendency to take the high quality supplements from M4s life for a while, get great results and then slowly I stop using them.
[31:14.000 --> 31:22.000]  I forget to religiously take them. I'm going to religiously take the supplements for the next few months and I've lost almost 40 pounds now.
[31:22.000 --> 31:28.000]  Everybody can see it on air. My energy is off the charts. Everything is amazing.
[31:28.000 --> 31:34.000]  And it's because I am taking the M4s Life products, the Krill Oil. I'm taking the X2 and the X3.
[31:34.000 --> 31:41.000]  I'm taking the Brain Force Plus when I work out, when I have to work really late. I'm taking half a pack of Turbo Force.
[31:41.000 --> 31:48.000]  It is clean energy. It is really making my whole life so much more enjoyable. It's making the shows more focused.
[31:48.000 --> 31:53.000]  I've got more energy. We have huge sales going right now for the new year at infowarslife.com.
[31:53.000 --> 31:58.000]  A big clearance sale. Take advantage of it all at infowarslife.com.

[32:15.000 --> 32:22.000]  I don't want the globalists to win for my children's future, for your children's future, but also I just personally don't want them to be able to shut us down.
[32:22.000 --> 32:26.000]  And thanks to you, spread the word and buy the products. We are able to stay on air.

[32:34.000 --> 32:38.000]  The new year is here. It's a great way to get healthy and fund the M4.

[32:52.000 --> 33:09.000]  But whatever you do, remember 2020 is a critical year, so everybody get the word out and fight for freedom.
[33:22.000 --> 33:24.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:38.000 --> 33:44.000]  Next segment, I'm going to play some clips from the control corporate media this weekend.
[33:44.000 --> 33:55.000]  A few days ago where they're trying to manage reality and it's just incredibly transparent and pathetic.
[33:55.000 --> 34:00.000]  But it's important to understand how they operate. So we'll do that next segment.
[34:00.000 --> 34:06.000]  Right now I wanted to get back into what I began to mention and actually play a video clip of this.
[34:06.000 --> 34:18.000]  Protest after German state broadcaster features children singing about their grandparents being environmental pigs for eating meat.
[34:18.000 --> 34:27.000]  And again, this is all being done because the environmental groups want to take control of energy, meat, everything to tax and control it.
[34:27.000 --> 34:37.000]  That's all this is, is a mafia muscling in like a priesthood to control every aspect of life. They don't tell the communists Chinese they can't have coal.
[34:37.000 --> 34:40.000]  They don't tell the communists Chinese they can't have meat.
[34:40.000 --> 34:52.000]  They only teach schoolchildren that they're bad and that they're killing the earth so they have guilt and can be ideologically programmed into this cult.
[34:52.000 --> 35:13.000]  Now, when's the last time in Germany, they had children talking about how their parents are bad and need to be watched and need to be lined up against a wall and shot as Greta said in Italy a few weeks ago, if they don't do what they're told.
[35:13.000 --> 35:27.000]  That was under Adolf Hitler, of course, and then we know now use the same blueprint with the high schools and colleges. The cultural revolution came out of the schools with the Maoist Youth Brigade.
[35:27.000 --> 35:49.000]  So in the textbook of authoritarian red line red flag alert alert alert danger danger is when the state starts organizing children against their parents, you don't walk from that you run from that.
[35:49.000 --> 35:59.000]  It's a formulae for being put in reeducation camps, which they're now calling for on the news for Trump supporters, fun camps, people go, well, that's crazy.
[35:59.000 --> 36:02.000]  It'll never happen.
[36:02.000 --> 36:03.000]  They're trying.
[36:03.000 --> 36:14.000]  You go, why are they trying it because it's succeeded other places, both Facebook and Google have moved into former Stasi bases in Germany.
[36:14.000 --> 36:24.000]  Former East Germany, you know, why are they doing that? Why are they hiring former deputy heads six years ago?
[36:24.000 --> 36:34.000]  People thought we were making that up when Obama hired Marcus Wolf before he died, the former head of the Stasi to advise him on Homeland Security.
[36:34.000 --> 36:44.000]  There was a line item in a congressional funding where Wolf almost got paid a million dollars to consult and people didn't believe it.
[36:44.000 --> 36:52.000]  Oh, there's no way the US government hired the former Stasi. Yes, they did.
[36:52.000 --> 37:05.000]  Make police states hip again. Google offered Stasi HQ for new Berlin office. You can't make this up.
[37:05.000 --> 37:23.000]  So let's go ahead and roll this in Deutsch. And then you'll hear Greta Thunberg, the leader, the Yukon's leader, saying that how dare you. I should not be here. I will put you up against the wall, but you must give your energy sources over.
[37:23.000 --> 37:27.000]  Only China can operate. No one else is allowed to.
[37:27.000 --> 37:40.000]  This is military operations against us. Here is German state run TV in the schools brainwashing the children.
[37:40.000 --> 37:46.000]  My grandparents died in the chicken coop with a motorcycle motorcycle motorcycle.
[37:46.000 --> 37:53.000]  There's thousands of gallons of gas every month. My grandmother is old environmental pig.
[37:53.000 --> 38:02.000]  My grandma say riding a motorcycle school so cool so cool.
[38:02.000 --> 38:10.000]  She's even uses it in the old folks home as wheelchair. My grandma is an old environmental swine.
[38:10.000 --> 38:18.000]  My grandma uses SUV to go to doctor doctor doctor.
[38:18.000 --> 38:26.000]  She runs over to grandma's on the mobility scooters. My grandma is an old environmental pig.
[38:26.000 --> 38:34.000]  Every day my grandma fries herself a pork chop. A pork chop. A pork chop.
[38:34.000 --> 38:42.000]  She does it because it discount meat cost nearly nothing. My grandma is an old environmental pig.
[38:42.000 --> 38:50.000]  My grandma doesn't fly on planes anymore. She reformed. She reformed. She reformed.
[38:50.000 --> 38:58.000]  Now she takes trips on cruise ships 10 times a year. My grandma isn't an environmental pig.
[38:58.000 --> 39:04.000]  My grandma isn't a pig. She submitted.
[39:04.000 --> 39:13.000]  Now back that up again and then they take control of the children and have them lip sync.
[39:13.000 --> 39:20.000]  We will sabotage your economy. We will shut you down. But only the West has to do it. Not India, not China.
[39:20.000 --> 39:25.000]  The globalists have full control. So can you guys just go to YouTube and type in Hitler Youth.
[39:25.000 --> 39:32.000]  Let's show some people some footage of Hitler Youth. And then you can just superimpose it over those children.
[39:32.000 --> 39:37.000]  We'll do that and post. You know, we're live right now. But once we post this demand on video.
[39:37.000 --> 39:43.000]  Let's add some Hitler Youth on there. How about some Chinese malice youth brigades?
[39:43.000 --> 39:47.000]  There's lots of color footage of that. Of them killing their parents.
[39:47.000 --> 39:53.000]  We can even show you the people lining their parents up and shooting them, putting them up against the wall.
[39:53.000 --> 39:58.000]  We will show you how to submit to the Reich and the leadership of the Fuhrer.
[39:58.000 --> 40:11.000]  I'm the work, I'm the Reich, I'm the Fuhrer, and our leader, and our spokesperson, Gal Leiter, Greta Humberg.
[40:11.000 --> 40:19.000]  So this is the type of behavior that we are ongoingly treated to.
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.000]  And you look at these so-called anti-fascists. They're the ones wearing black uniforms.
[40:23.000 --> 40:27.000]  They're the ones behaving like that. They're the ones that are doing all this.
[40:27.000 --> 40:33.000]  Meanwhile, that story is up on infowars.com. I hope you share it.
[40:33.000 --> 40:38.000]  Meanwhile, the New York Times loves racism and hates white people.
[40:38.000 --> 40:41.000]  That's the RT headline, and they actually quote it.
[40:41.000 --> 40:50.000]  And we've got BBC articles right here where it actually says that...
[40:50.000 --> 41:05.000]  Yet, I'm one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying.
[41:05.000 --> 41:12.000]  Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction.
[41:12.000 --> 41:23.000]  And all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  I should not be here.
[41:25.000 --> 41:31.000]  For more than 30 years, the science has been crystal clear.
[41:31.000 --> 41:38.000]  How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you're doing enough
[41:38.000 --> 41:44.000]  when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight?
[41:44.000 --> 41:49.000]  You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency.
[41:49.000 --> 41:55.000]  But no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not want to believe that.
[41:55.000 --> 42:01.000]  Because if you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act,
[42:01.000 --> 42:07.000]  then you would be evil, and that I refuse to believe.
[42:07.000 --> 42:14.000]  Every authoritarian regime takes control of the children and brainwashes them against their parents and grandparents.
[42:14.000 --> 42:20.000]  And they even sing about grandma kills grandma's stupid old pig granny.
[42:20.000 --> 42:26.000]  My granny is a pig. She's a big fat pig. She killed other old people.
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  Old people dying.
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  Tall formulae.
[42:32.000 --> 42:38.000]  If they can't brainwash those that are already informed, they will take the youth and turn them into weapons against the people.
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  And they will teach you inherently.
[42:40.000 --> 42:50.000]  But the BBC that don't go hiding in Scotland, you'll see far too many able-bodied white men.
[42:50.000 --> 42:53.000]  No!
[43:01.000 --> 43:04.000]  Owl killer in New Jersey. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.000]  Alex, hey, I just want to say it's great to be back once again, and I've never gotten to do this,
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  but I'm going to give you a shout out for your budget.
[43:10.000 --> 43:15.000]  So that super blue Florida free toothpaste and that super blue whitening toothpaste is on another level.
[43:15.000 --> 43:18.000]  I use the super blue in the morning and then the whitening at night.
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  And it absorbs into your gum.
[43:20.000 --> 43:23.000]  It is by far the best product that I've ever used in my life.
[43:23.000 --> 43:26.000]  I literally just took turbo force on my way to the gym right now.
[43:26.000 --> 43:34.000]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and a back surgery, and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life.
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  So I just want to get that out of the way.
[43:36.000 --> 43:39.000]  Support this man. Everything that he exposed. Nobody knew about Bohemian Grove.
[43:39.000 --> 43:41.000]  Nobody knew about FD. Nobody knew about Bilderberg.
[43:41.000 --> 43:43.000]  Nobody called 9-11 before it happened.
[43:43.000 --> 43:46.000]  In July 2001, go look it up yourself.
[43:46.000 --> 43:49.000]  Well, we try our best, sir. They definitely want us off the air without you or not here.
[43:49.000 --> 43:51.000]  But yeah, these are all great products. So thank you, sir.
[43:58.000 --> 44:09.000]  In the year 2020, crazed leftists are literally crawling out of their political graves and attacking Americans that dare not submit to their bullying.
[44:09.000 --> 44:10.000]  2020.
[44:10.000 --> 44:20.000]  2020 is here, and despite all the globalist efforts, thanks to you, the listeners and viewers, Infowars is still on the air in 2020.
[44:20.000 --> 44:28.000]  So remember, it's a great way to get healthy and get in shape and focus your mind with the products of InfowarsLife.com and fund the Infowar.
[44:28.000 --> 44:32.000]  It's a total 360 win. All you've got to do is take action.
[44:32.000 --> 44:35.000]  The only way we fail is if you don't take action.

[44:54.000 --> 44:58.000]  2020 and InfowarsLife.com. Take action now.
[44:59.000 --> 45:04.000]  The best product. I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now. If you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[45:04.000 --> 45:10.000]  I've tried TurboForce with everything. Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[45:10.000 --> 45:15.000]  That was a crazy week. I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite.
[45:15.000 --> 45:22.000]  And all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you.
[45:22.000 --> 45:28.000]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks, I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[45:28.000 --> 45:34.000]  I'm going to wake up today. You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.000]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me.
[45:38.000 --> 45:43.000]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way?
[45:43.000 --> 45:47.000]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what?
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.000]  Okay, I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com.
[45:51.000 --> 45:55.000]  Take control of your health right now and support the resistance. Don't buy into the groupthink.
[45:55.000 --> 45:59.000]  Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the Turbo Force. Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good.
[45:59.000 --> 46:02.000]  Just deer in the bright, I went and got a delicious cup.
[46:02.000 --> 46:07.000]  My second cup of the day, it's really strong. I shouldn't do this because all work and no playmates are jacked.
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  A really aggressive boy, and the coffee adds to it.
[46:09.000 --> 46:12.000]  But wake up America coffee there by loves. Highest rated.
[46:12.000 --> 46:16.000]  From the choppest mountains, it's beyond Mexican coffee. Beyond Guatemala and coffee, it's the best coffee in the world.
[46:16.000 --> 46:19.000]  It's right on the border between the two countries in those rainforests.
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  Hand selected. It's beyond organic. Wildcrafted.
[46:21.000 --> 46:28.000]  Wake up America coffee. People are blown away by how good it is. Same stuff sold in Whole Foods under another name for $30 for the same size container.
[46:28.000 --> 46:31.000]  Yes, folks, we've been selling it 10 years. Never raised the price.
[46:31.000 --> 46:36.000]  $19.95 is that big old bag. 99% reviews. 598 reviews.
[46:36.000 --> 46:40.000]  4.9 stars on third-party sites. Sign up for auto-ship additional 10% off.
[46:40.000 --> 46:43.000]  Get an auto-deliberty, so don't forget to get it each month or every two months.
[46:43.000 --> 46:46.000]  You can click out to nine months whenever you want the new order coming in.
[46:46.000 --> 46:47.000]  15 days for nine months.
[46:47.000 --> 46:50.000]  Patriot blend. Medium roast.
[46:50.000 --> 46:54.000]  Only has a 98% out of 814 reviews.
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  It's not as popular.
[46:56.000 --> 46:59.000]  Anyways, it's all at infowarsstore.com.
[46:59.000 --> 47:19.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:19.000 --> 47:41.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[47:41.000 --> 47:46.000]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting Worldwide.
[47:46.000 --> 47:56.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:56.000 --> 48:01.000]  Now, I want to spend a few minutes here going over how the propaganda works.
[48:01.000 --> 48:04.000]  And look, we all know mainstream media lies. We know they spin.
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.000]  We know that they belittle the American people.
[48:07.000 --> 48:14.000]  But what you're about to see is so arrogant and so authoritarian by racial mad-out.
[48:14.000 --> 48:22.000]  I'm sorry, Chris Hayes on MSNBC, that we really need to play it and analyze it.
[48:22.000 --> 48:27.000]  Because every few seconds, he's revealing their game plan, their operations.
[48:27.000 --> 48:36.000]  First, they glorify shadowy traders in the government who put out fake information as leaks
[48:36.000 --> 48:41.000]  and then never get in trouble and no one gets to face their accuser.
[48:41.000 --> 48:46.000]  And they demonize the president and others for saying Eric Ciramella
[48:46.000 --> 48:50.000]  and all the millions of people that have been censored on Twitter and Facebook
[48:50.000 --> 48:54.000]  who've had their post taken down or been banned for saying his godlike name.
[48:54.000 --> 49:00.000]  That then sets the precedent that if you're Fiona Hill and George Soros' minion
[49:00.000 --> 49:04.000]  and you're the supposed first person that heard this that doesn't exist,
[49:04.000 --> 49:07.000]  the transcript and all the other witnesses say it's a lie,
[49:07.000 --> 49:16.000]  it doesn't matter because you are infallible above the pope himself, okay?
[49:16.000 --> 49:27.000]  So then he goes into the arrogance of, oh, and then Trump keeps tweeting from these obscure nobodies.
[49:27.000 --> 49:30.000]  Why, some of these Twitter accounts just don't even have any followers like,
[49:30.000 --> 49:35.000]  oh, Trump will put out what some housewife says or what some auto mechanic says
[49:35.000 --> 49:42.000]  or what some farmer says or what a black forklift operator says.
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  Because that's that's a real case.
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.000]  A fellow put out a funny tweet and be a black forklift operator.
[49:47.000 --> 49:51.000]  They got him fired in New York last year, found out who he was.
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  They tracked him down.
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.000]  Trump thought his tweet made sense and then, you know, they fired him last time I heard.
[49:57.000 --> 50:03.000]  So how dare you Trump tweet when a black forklift operator has to say when it makes sense.
[50:03.000 --> 50:07.000]  How dare you put out with an old school teacher who's an old white lady has to say,
[50:07.000 --> 50:13.000]  how dare you you're supposed to only do what the New York and the DC and the LA elites,
[50:13.000 --> 50:17.000]  the ones that tell us, you know, women can have babies.
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  But we know that these aren't women.
[50:19.000 --> 50:24.000]  These are men that say they're women and that women can be sperm donors.
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  So he lectures people for seven minutes.
[50:27.000 --> 50:28.000]  I'm not going to play the whole thing.
[50:28.000 --> 50:32.000]  Just the first few minutes is enough to make you go crazy.
[50:32.000 --> 50:38.000]  But this is illustrative of everything we're talking about.
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  The real Donald Trump.
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.000]  And what's the overall message here?
[50:43.000 --> 50:49.000]  Well, starting last week, dozens of Trump tweets were blocked.
[50:49.000 --> 50:54.000]  They were shadow banned where no one could see them unless you had the actual URL.
[50:54.000 --> 50:55.000]  We reported on it.
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  Anyway, Punnett reported on it.
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  The people at first couldn't believe it was happening.
[50:59.000 --> 51:02.000]  We're 300 days out from the election.
[51:02.000 --> 51:07.000]  They are now moving against how he communicates because he's not stood up to the racketeering,
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  to the election meddling.
[51:09.000 --> 51:15.000]  And so they're setting the precedent now and saying, oh, he gave out Eric Ciaramella's number,
[51:15.000 --> 51:18.000]  his info, his name.
[51:18.000 --> 51:22.000]  And so he has to have armed guards now.
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  But then he also says, we don't even know who the whistleblower is.
[51:24.000 --> 51:25.000]  That's right.
[51:25.000 --> 51:26.000]  It's just some nebulous person.
[51:26.000 --> 51:31.000]  No, it's Brennan giving the order for somebody to make the report.
[51:31.000 --> 51:34.000]  And then they got to protect that person because they can't ever be upon a stand
[51:34.000 --> 51:37.000]  because it'll come out who ordered them to do it.
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.000]  Because we know who ordered them to do it.
[51:39.000 --> 51:42.000]  Because Trump's using the same surveillance state against them now.
[51:42.000 --> 51:44.000]  And that's why they're so desperate and that's why they're so scared.
[51:44.000 --> 51:48.000]  So let's go to, again, the little man with his glasses,
[51:48.000 --> 51:52.000]  supposed to look real intellectual, talking down his nose at everybody.
[51:52.000 --> 51:53.000]  Here he is.
[51:53.000 --> 51:58.000]  For months now, basically the moment after we learned about the whistleblower's complaint
[51:58.000 --> 52:00.000]  on the president's dealings with Ukraine,
[52:00.000 --> 52:05.000]  the right-wing media has been obsessed with the identity of the whistleblower.
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.000]  Many right-wing outlets have published the name of a person they claim is a whistleblower.
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  We don't know if it is.
[52:11.000 --> 52:12.000]  And they're not alone.
[52:12.000 --> 52:13.000]  Don Jr. has outed this individual.
[52:13.000 --> 52:14.000]  Senator Rand Paul.
[52:14.000 --> 52:15.000]  Hi, boss.
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  Again, let's back it up.
[52:17.000 --> 52:18.000]  Ten seconds.
[52:18.000 --> 52:21.000]  We don't know who it is because now we get to be accused by people
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  and we never find out who they are.
[52:23.000 --> 52:29.000]  And then they act like it's illegal to know who your accuser is to set that precedent.
[52:29.000 --> 52:33.000]  This is the new system where the president's phone calls are all transcripts.
[52:33.000 --> 52:34.000]  Those are all public.
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  He doesn't get any privacy as the president.
[52:36.000 --> 52:41.000]  But these magic people, these deep staters that Trump's finally firing all of them today,
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  they get carte blanche.
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.000]  Continue.
[52:44.000 --> 52:45.000]  We don't know if it is.
[52:45.000 --> 52:46.000]  And they're not alone.
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  Don Jr. has outed this individual.
[52:48.000 --> 52:49.000]  Senator Rand Paul.
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  Congressman Louis Gohmert.
[52:51.000 --> 52:52.000]  All of them have done it.
[52:52.000 --> 52:55.000]  And so perhaps it was only a matter of time before the president did it himself.
[52:55.000 --> 53:00.000]  He did it over the weekend in his favorite venue for this sort of thing, his Twitter feed.
[53:00.000 --> 53:03.000]  The thing is, those tweets have real world effects.
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  As the Washington Post notes, quote,
[53:05.000 --> 53:10.000]  when threats against the whistleblower spike often seemingly spurred by presidential tweets,
[53:10.000 --> 53:13.000]  he is driven to and from work by armed security officers.
[53:13.000 --> 53:20.000]  That's a U.S. government official who needs a security detail because the president is directing Venometta.
[53:20.000 --> 53:25.000]  And this all comes in as a very, very noticeable uptake in the president's Twitter activity.
[53:25.000 --> 53:26.000]  Let's stop again.
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  Did you catch all those lies?
[53:28.000 --> 53:31.000]  They just say he's getting all these threats and he needs security detail,
[53:31.000 --> 53:34.000]  but he's not the whistleblower or maybe he is.
[53:34.000 --> 53:38.000]  And it's all because of this thing called the president communicating with the people.
[53:38.000 --> 53:41.000]  This terrible thing that he should stop doing.
[53:41.000 --> 53:47.000]  So this is a giant attack on free speech of the president, all being normalized here by Chris Sayes.
[53:47.000 --> 53:48.000]  Continue.
[53:48.000 --> 53:54.000]  Some that are brand new with zero followers pushing forward weird conspiracy theories from the darkest corners of the Internet.
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  Behavior that raises serious questions.
[53:56.000 --> 54:00.000]  For instance, how does he even find these accounts to retweet them?
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  All right, let's stop again.
[54:02.000 --> 54:03.000]  Did you hear that?
[54:03.000 --> 54:08.000]  These weird accounts with almost no followers.
[54:08.000 --> 54:12.000]  Because he sees a funny video, he sees somebody saying something makes sense.
[54:12.000 --> 54:13.000]  He puts it out.
[54:13.000 --> 54:19.000]  He reaches down to the average person and magnifies that just like we have callers call him with great ideas.
[54:19.000 --> 54:25.000]  We implement it because your ideas are damn original, damn good.
[54:25.000 --> 54:29.000]  We know most inventions come from the grassroots.
[54:29.000 --> 54:33.000]  The best parties are just with average people, not with a bunch of stuck-up elitists.
[54:33.000 --> 54:34.000]  We're commoners.
[54:34.000 --> 54:35.000]  We're Americans.
[54:35.000 --> 54:36.000]  We're proud of it.
[54:36.000 --> 54:40.000]  Alexander de Tocqueville, the French historian, came here and spent a decade after the Revolutionary War.
[54:40.000 --> 54:45.000]  He said Americans were the most amazing people ever because they were about what you stood for and what you did and who you were,
[54:45.000 --> 54:48.000]  just like Martin Luther King talked about later.
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  Martin Luther King Jr.
[54:50.000 --> 54:54.000]  It's about who you really are, not what royal family you came from.
[54:54.000 --> 54:57.000]  And so Trump values what the average people are saying.
[54:57.000 --> 55:01.000]  And they're trying to cut the people off from the president who's trying to represent them.
[55:01.000 --> 55:06.000]  And this arrogant SOB is up there like royalty, like, can you believe it?
[55:06.000 --> 55:12.000]  Where he gets all this stuff and they shake their heads because it scares the hell out of them because their corporate boards aren't in control of this country.
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  Let's go back to it.
[55:14.000 --> 55:20.000]  Some that are brand new with zero followers pushing forward weird conspiracy theories from the darkest corners of the Internet.
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.000]  Behavior that raises serious questions.
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.000]  For instance, how does he even find these accounts to retweet them?
[55:26.000 --> 55:32.000]  Joining me now is NBC News reporter Ben Collins, who spends much of his time chasing down bots and conspiracy networks.
[55:32.000 --> 55:33.000]  Can pause again.
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  Chasing down bots and conspiracy networks.
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  You're not really a real person.
[55:37.000 --> 55:40.000]  You're a bot and a conspiracy network.
[55:40.000 --> 55:45.000]  And once they say you're part of that conspiracy network, because they're the conspiracy against America,
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  then you can be shut down.
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.000]  They have congressional hearings and they turn the CIA loose on you.
[55:50.000 --> 55:51.000]  But something happened.
[55:51.000 --> 55:54.000]  Trump's firing all the State Department people that really run all this.
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  He fired a whole bunch of them yesterday and today.
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.000]  And now they're crapping big old bricks.
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  We're going to come back and get into that.
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  This is so huge, ladies and gentlemen.
[56:03.000 --> 56:10.000]  Oh, but listen, this big expert, he finds out, well, somebody else magnified the commoners tweet and then Trump put that out.
[56:10.000 --> 56:13.000]  He's like a rocket scientist explaining this to us here.
[56:13.000 --> 56:14.000]  Go back to it.
[56:14.000 --> 56:15.000]  Here's the networks.
[56:15.000 --> 56:18.000]  Ben, let's start on that first question.
[56:18.000 --> 56:22.000]  Sometimes the president will retweet an account and it has very few followers.
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  Sometimes it's following zero people.
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  In one case recently in this recent JAG, he retweeted the first tweet of an account.
[56:29.000 --> 56:34.000]  And I thought to myself, how did he get there to find out this person was tweeting and retweet their first account?
[56:34.000 --> 56:35.000]  How does that work?
[56:35.000 --> 56:36.000]  Yeah.
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  So in this case, he got there from Sev Gorka, but Sev Gorka retweeted this account.
[56:40.000 --> 56:41.000]  That's enough.
[56:41.000 --> 56:42.000]  That's enough.
[56:42.000 --> 56:43.000]  So pure elitism.
[56:43.000 --> 56:44.000]  We're going to go to break.
[56:44.000 --> 56:48.000]  I'm going to come back with the rest of the story and why this is so exciting and good news.
[56:48.000 --> 56:59.000]  And just the mindset of these people who are told what to say and they all repeat the talking points and to watch a president going off the people's talking points and just common sense enrages them.
[56:59.000 --> 57:00.000]  They're control freaks.
[57:00.000 --> 57:01.000]  We're going to go to break.
[57:01.000 --> 57:02.000]  Come back.
[57:02.000 --> 57:03.000]  I'm going to finish up with this.
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  They get into the big inch a lot of the rest of the hour.
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  Their plan to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.
[57:07.000 --> 57:12.000]  Please don't forget, this is the last four days of the biggest sales we're ever going to have.

[57:21.000 --> 57:22.000]  But this is it.

[57:54.000 --> 57:58.000]  I'd always taken them in the past, but I forget like everybody else to stay on the regiment.
[57:58.000 --> 58:04.000]  Well, I've done it and I've lost 39 pounds in less than four months and my life is so amazing.
[58:04.000 --> 58:09.000]  And I still have cake and ice cream and pie just like I did before.
[58:09.000 --> 58:14.000]  I'm exercising the same amount, but my body has the trace elements and the key things it needs.
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  Like the clean iodine and X2 and X3.
[58:16.000 --> 58:21.000]  And I take a good energy booster like turbo force and brain force for my brain.

[59:43.000 --> 59:46.000]  But whatever you do remember 2020 is a critical year.
[59:46.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  Everybody get the word out and fight for freedom.
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  From the frontline of the information war.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  From the frontline of the information war it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  What we are looking at is good and evil right and wrong.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  So you got all these political operatives like Chuck Todd worked for the Clintons and Obama on his National Sunday TV show.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  He puts out the talking points to everybody and you just saw MSNBC mad that Trump is tweeting obscure people.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  How dare you retweet what the peasantry is up to.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  Well I thought I'd play this clip from earlier in the week again from last weekend.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  I think I played it on Monday because it's so illustrative of this ecosystem where it goes from 4chan to Reddit to info wars to the gateway pundit which is total bull.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  Reddit Thunberg says we're going to line people up and kill them.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  The Germans teach kids that their parents and grandparents are pigs that need to die because they don't you know do we write a story about it showing how your monsters.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  That's how it works.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  We cover the horrible stuff you're doing and then we race to try to get it out before the competition.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  We don't we don't like get our talking points from oh what what 4chan say oh what the oh what drugs say.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  They always ask like Alex just said what was going to be in Trump's speech it is inauguration and he said exactly that.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  New York Times like was like he talked to you this morning.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  No one had this beach and I said I can already figure out I wrote the speech on the air in the last 20 years.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  It's like in 1984 when.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  Winston's getting tortured and the ministry of truth and O'Brien walks in.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  He says they got you and he goes yeah they got me a long time ago.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  It's hilarious.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  I'm sorry.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  I'm sorry.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  It's just really funny.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  I haven't figured it out yet.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  So so let's just let's just go to this this ridiculousness.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  It comes from the people from the grassroots.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  That's where the real power is.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  You people don't have any real power in your soul.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  So you go to DC looking for a soul and all you find is more soullessness.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  You can't feed off vampires.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  Here they are.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  Matthew I want you to address what I think is an ecosystem problem at least on the right.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  I want to put up something that one of my colleague Ben Collins put here.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  It's a it's a bit of an ecosystem here.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  You'll say you'll get something starts on 4chan.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  There's the subreddit of Trump info wars might pick it up.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  Then it starts inching into the mainstream gateway pundit might just say oh what's this about.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  Then it gets to drudge might have a provocative headline link.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  Rush might say it in his fun little way.
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  Then it does make its way into Fox News.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  And then of course your Facebook feed.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  How do you create more accountability in the conservative ecosystem for basically dealing with propaganda?
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  Well it's hard work and I think it begins by trying to construct young conservatives.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  Let me ask very officials and powerful empirical verification.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  They say oh all the science is in empirical verification by the year 2013 all major cities will be under water.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  We must no one wants your guns but we will confiscate them.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  Men can have babies.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  Women can give sperm.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  The Easter Bunny is real.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  Credential sources of evidence or information.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  They don't trust any of it.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  I don't trust anything coming out of that news mouth.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  I'm sure as hell I can let him get there my kids.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  You can go to the supermarket and you see the tabloids.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  Get him off the screen sorry.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  This is all about these control freaks wanting to control the narrative because America was asleep.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  Because we didn't have TV 70 80 years ago so you snuck up on the farmers.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  And you got them mesmerized because the first shows were nice family programs and you know father knows best and leave it to beaver and all that.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  And the honeymooners.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  But that's like a worm on a hook.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  Now we're awake and we're like a bass that's been caught a few times and gotten away.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  We know a hook and a worm.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  And you hang it from us and go.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  Ever seen a basket mad and look at the hook and knows where it is and go away.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  A little stupid one comes over and grabs it.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  We're not taking your bait anymore.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  You chicken neck blue blood one of these.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  You people have nothing.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  You have nothing.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  We have broken with you.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  You are pathetic maggots.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  You and your witch or Hillary will all burn in your own instrument.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  Yes.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  You want to break some globalist ribs.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  You want to crush some skulls politically.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually.
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  There's nowhere you can place your bet.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  In a fight where it's going to have more power per dollar.
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  Your bang for your buck here gets you great products at great prices that literally fund the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  And so it's very simple.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy, which God wants to see.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  You see, we have to make the effort.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  110% God will finish the move.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  I want to attack.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  I want to go after the globalists.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  I want to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for your family.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:20.000]  Share this together at infowarstore.com.
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  Hatred on the streets of Charlottesville last night, white nationalist Kerry torches.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  It was a weekend of street battles and stark displays of racism.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  But you also had people that were verified people on both sides.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  We are in a battle for the soul of the nation.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  Everything that's made America America is at stake.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  Limited to four years, history will treat this as an aberration, but if there's eight years of this administration, I think it will forever and fundamentally change the character and the trajectory of this nation.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  Everybody knows who Donald Trump is.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  We have to let them know who we are.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  What we stand for.
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  We choose from over fear.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  Truth over lies.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  We are the United States of America.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  There's not a single thing we cannot do if we do it together.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  So that's the best shot they've got.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  Running around saying we're taking all the guns.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  White people are inherently evil.
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  World governments wonderful.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  Get rid of the borders.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  America was never great.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  It'll never be great.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  Again, you have the good guy, the good cop in the good cop, bad cop game, Joe Biden sounding like he's Ronald Reagan speaking against the Soviet Union, like it's Trump.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  And we're unified and we're together.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  And we're one nation.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  When all the people he represents have been doing have been trying to split this country up because they're globalist.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  They want to get rid of the nation state.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  They want to dominate us.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  They want to have the World Bank and the IMF and the TPP and these unelected globalist boards run our countries.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  And Obama and Hillary and the neocons are all for that.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  That's why they detest the idea of the president tweeting out what a 40 year old florist has to say or what a 70 year old retired police officer has to say or what a black 40 year old forklift driver in New York has to say.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  Those are all real people I just listed that were targeted by the media and found out who they were and lost their jobs for Trump retweeting them, punishing them for reaching out to the president and sending the message to anybody that thinks they're going to bring this country back.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  We're coming for you.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  Well, guess what?
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  Your bullying has completely and totally turned everyone I know who are Democrats against you.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  And I want to be clear.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  I'm not somebody that comes on the air and puts out good news because I want to make it so like Oprah Winfrey and the secret.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  You have to have the climate, the energy, the culture, the system, the ingredients to build the new Atlantis.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  By the way, we have all those ingredients and more.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  The globalists know that as civilization accelerates, their old paradigms of control are going to be completely obsolete. That's why they're trying to suppress innovation and industry and the next human development and have a breakaway civilization where the future is not evenly distributed.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  And so I am a collectivist and that I believe people should have an opportunity to have access to the future.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  And that's the thing about what's about to happen is that there's unlimited potential and you see that.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  But instead we're working more hours than ever.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  Even as humans are made obsolete because they're building a post human world, it's the only way the globalist can fully capture control of the species and maintain control in a bifurcated new dark age.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  Now, how do I know all this and how did the things we talked about 25 years ago, how is it all coming true now?
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  People are like, you're a prophet. No, I'm not.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  I've studied political systems. I've studied the current globalist. I know their roots. I read their white papers. I've made films on it.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  And I'm telling you what they say they're going to do.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  And that's why it's all coming true because it was already true.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  So starting next segment, I'm going to plunge into this.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  But Biden in all of his campaign ads, the original ones, the ones that came out recently and the newest, tell you with edited videos that Trump supports the KKK.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  And you go to those events and you look at who leads those white supremacist groups of the five leaders, four of them worked for Obama and Hillary a year before they went out to Charlottesville and organized that.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  And listen, you know how to typecast people, you know on average what people, what groups look like.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  And I saw the white supremacist marchers, the original Tiki torch ones, and it was like a gay statewide drama club.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  And then you go track the guys down. They're like gay, gay drama club guys.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  And they're pissed. They all got together and dressed up in their little Nazi outfits from the 1940s and kind of sashayed around and did that.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  And it's ridiculous. And they're pissed that I exposed them.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  Hell, the Democrats even put ads out to hire actors where you can rent mobs.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  You can go to websites and rent a mob of AstroTurf to go do whatever you want.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  And that's what these people are.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  Now, some real good old boy types showed up and a lot of them were pressed and we had pressed there.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  They got called white supremacists for covering it.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  And that's what Trump was talking about, saying there were good people on both sides there to cover it and there to see what was going on.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  Trump said bad groups on both sides, the white supremacists and Antifa.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  But he said good people there too that got hurted together by the police and got hurt and that's wrong.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  That's totally true.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  So Soros financed that and knew exactly what he'd get and I'll show you all the documents coming up.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  And Georgetown is suing me to keep this from coming out.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  Everybody knows Georgetown basically runs the CIA.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  But the good news is Trump is digging them all out right now.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  And he just fired a whole ton of them.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  I'll tell you about that. It all integrates together.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  But that's why the New York Times and Netflix and everything else is saying whites are inherently evil, whites are inherently bad.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  That's to freak white people out and make them racist, trick some minorities into becoming racist and make us fight with each other.
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  Let's not do it. Let's not be stupid.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  So that's the reality, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  And that's how they operate.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  And so what do they do when Soros hires crowds to go do that?
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  They isolate one person out of the story to say that I said they did all this and then that person suits me when I didn't say that.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  But that's how this operates because they're so scared.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  Well, all they've gotten is for me to put massive resources on this and we're going to have so many people in Virginia we already do.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  And I'm not going to get into the details of it, but private investigators accredited everything and we're going to expose them because the left can't help it.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  They're going to try to do it again and we're going to expose them.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  And we're going to be here on the air in a year and in two years and in five years and in 10 years because the listeners and viewers.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  And the system can't stand it.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  So we're going to lay it all out their plan to blow America into a thousand pieces and how we together are going to stop it.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  But I need you to spread the word about info wars dot com forward slash show ban dot video the live feeds.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  That's how we reach new people and you're doing a great job.

[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  And we entered 2020, but it's the end of the year sale that's hanging over a few days.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  I can only run it for about four days.

[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  We'll never have 70% off again.

[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  Anyways, it's all at infowarstore.com.
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  I spend a lot of time reminding the Info Wars family of listeners and viewers
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  that without you we won't be on the air and I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres.
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  You've got that pledge from me but you've seen the third party test out there,
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  the air filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there

[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  So it's not a burden to support Info Wars.
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.

[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  A.I. didn't come up with that.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  A.I. comes from us and we're just a zygote right now.
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  Have not even begun to realize one percent of our destiny.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  Control freaks are not going to suppress human destiny or will.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  Like a beach ball trying to hold the water on the bottom of the pool, it only explodes with that much more force once it is freed.
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  I want to thank the globalists for persecuting me because it always shows me the way.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  The more the attacks, the more they squeal, the more they tell us not to investigate the more we do.
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  And now it's completely transparent.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  So let me just do this ahead of Tom Papert joining us, who's greatnationalfile.com broke this on Monday.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  And now it's a big story linked up on drudgereport.com. It's one of the top trending stories in nationalist and pro-survival, pro-human, common sense media.
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  The entire game plan is to foment conflict between what they call Trump supporters and the loving Antifa angels.
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  That time magazine for kids and Vogue for teens tells us is just wonderful people that are helping suppress the speech of Nazis.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  And anyone that supports America or freedom or justice is a Nazi.
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  And their main funder is a famous Nazi collaborator that said it was the happiest time of his life rounding up Jews.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  He called it happy making and said it was exhilarating.
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  It was quite fun, actually, the feeling of power.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  And so they collided these two things together in Charlottesville.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  It was mainly reporters they're covering, but the police, the state police,
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  kettled the white supremacists who were mainly leftists, opposing as that,
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  in together to have a big collision, have all the leftist media out there to cover it, knowing they're being an explosion.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  Doesn't mean they themselves executed it, knowing they'll create some hysteria.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  Somebody will have a heart attack, somebody will get hit by a car.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  And then you can blame it on Trump.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  And now Biden, who's been running for president for a year, has put out a whole bunch of ads always about Charlottesville.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  And in Virginia, that's 90 percent geographically conservative, but in the north, it's a suburb of D.C.,
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  now controlled by the Democrats.
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  They have all three branches.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  And they're betting everything on places like Virginia where they intend at checkpoints, gun confiscation,
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  and hope that some good old boys start shooting some people after January 20th when they start trying to take the guns.
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  We're going to be covering it there, live on the ground,
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  and we're going to be exposing the fact that the last round of leadership of the white supremacists,
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  four of the five again are on record, all working for Hillary and Obama's campaigns previously.
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  But they go, oh, we changed our minds now.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  I've had some of them on the shows. They're like, no, no, we're white nationalists now.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  And Georgetown, all these people don't want us talking about this.
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  Well, we are talking about it.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  So let's go over it right now.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  Here's the article.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  Joe Biden releases ad touting Charlottesville very fine people hoax.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  Virginia representative says use military and law enforcement to take the guns that go into effect January 20th in 18 days in Virginia.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  And then this big article, why is the UN hiring English speaking disarmament officers in New York?
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  It says for gun confiscation internationally and domestically in the ad.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  Leak U.S. Army documents plan for reeducation camps in America. Paul Joseph Watson 2012, a document for 2010, we broke it.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  And it says for America, Syops officers to process American gun owners into reeducation camps.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  And here's the actual document, FM three dash three nine dot 40.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  First, they said this wasn't real for six months.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  Then they had to admit it was real.
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  So Obama tried to get our military.
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  People go, why are you bashing the military?
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  That's like if you gave a short order cook, you know, the order to put cyanide in your food, they wouldn't do it.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  The military is who leaked this to us before it was public.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  This is what Obama was trying to secretly cook behind the scenes.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  And again, the strong cities initiative guys, print me some articles on strong cities, Loretta Lynch, click web to find it.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  And you'll there's even videos.
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  We have talked about those.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  We should play those again with the attorney general at the time saying we're going to have the UN run police departments during all that anti cop bad shooting stuff.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  They were foaming where it turned out almost every shooting was legitimate.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  I'm not saying there aren't bad cops out there. Absolutely.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  But the media was hyping it to create that crisis.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  There it is.
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  Department of Justice 2015.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  It says use the UN in America in term and resettlement operations FM three dash three nine dot 40.
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  DoD personnel in America, how to process people into reeducation camps.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  That is the Soviet term.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  And what is the new UN add call for disarmament and relocation specialist English speaking to operate on the east coast of the United States.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  These two articles go together.
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  We need to get some articles written up about how this dovetails.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  So they're quietly through the bureaucracy that the deep state still controls a lot of trying to gear this up to trigger COG emergency powers.
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  That would be put in in the 25th amendment to remove President Trump during a national crisis.
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  A national civil unrest kicked off like the 1960s that threatens open civil war if Trump doesn't stand down.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  And you've got the Democrats saying Virginia governor plans to use roadblocks and UN troops to seize guns.
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  Dave Hodges interviews Mike Adams.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  This is from December 20th.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  10 days before the national file article broke calling for the UN operatives to operate in the US for gun confiscation.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  Go read it for yourself.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  Cannot make this up.
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  And then you've got the UN running martial law and white slavery all over the planet.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  And they're incredible history of that.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  And then we've got these articles.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  The New York Times, the BBC, everything saying whites are inherently bad people because of their genetics.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  That's why they build countries everybody tries to get into.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  And white people decrying themselves and saying they have white privilege and are inherently bad,
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  trying to legitimize a racial uprising out of which the country will completely collapse.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  The New York Times loves racism and hates white people.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  Big article from RT up on infowars.com.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  It's OK to be white trends on Twitter.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  The New York Times begins 2020 with feature story on how white people are bad for existing.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  No kidding.
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  There's too many areas that still are mainly white.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  That's bad.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  And whites are bad.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  It's all coming up.
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  Tom Papard joins us.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  The authoritarians are making their move, but it's blowing up in their face.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  So they're only getting more desperate.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  And then we'll cover this when we return how it ties in.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  Obama's National Security Council holdovers finally booted after years of nonstop leaks.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  That's a lot bigger than just that.
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  Stay with us.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  You do not want to miss this.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:56.000]  and infowarslife.com.
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:59.000]  Take action now.
[1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:02.000]  A little less than four months ago, I made the announcement on air.
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  I said, hey, I have a tendency to take the high quality supplements for infowarslife for a while,
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:12.000]  get great results, and then slowly I stop using them.
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  I forget to religiously take them.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:18.000]  I'm going to religiously take the supplements for the next few months,
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:21.000]  and I've lost almost 40 pounds now.
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:23.000]  Everybody can see it on air.
[1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  My energy is off the charts.
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  Everything is amazing.
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:30.000]  And it's because I am taking the infowarslife products, the krill oil.
[1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  I'm taking the X2 and the X3.
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:37.000]  I'm taking the brain force plus when I work out, when I have to work really late.
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  I'm taking half a pack of turbo force.
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  It is clean energy.
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:45.000]  It is really making my whole life so much more enjoyable.
[1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  It's making the shows more focused.
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  I've got more energy.
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  We have huge sales going right now for the new year at infowarslife.com.
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:53.000]  A big clearance sale.
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:33:18.000]  Take advantage of it all at infowarslife.com.
[1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  Well, propaganda has all been prepared.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  Biden is betting his whole campaign on hoping that some extreme right wing and left wing antifogrips collide and crash into each other.
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  And the oldest trick in the book, and what happened to it great extent in Charlottesville, Virginia a few years ago,
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  is a bunch of leftists dressed up like white supremacists, had their own rallies, got real white supremacists, nationalists,
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  but also just traditionalists to show up and a lot of press.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  Antifa came in an attack funded by Soros and Alexander Soros.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  I have the documents right here.
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  I'll show them to you.
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  That's on record.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  It's a fact that they're the main funders.
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  They don't even deny it.
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  And then Trump was called a white supremacist who supposedly endorsed it when he never did.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  He said there were bad people on the right wing side, bad people on the left wing side.
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  There were a lot of good people on both sides that just came to see what was happening.
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  Well, they leave the came to see what was happening.
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  Like our Millie Weber that got tear gassed with her husband.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  She was there to cover it.
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  She got called a white supremacist.
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  That's ridiculous.
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  But that's what they do because the corporate media wants to demonize anybody that asks questions.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  Now, they are heating up for Virginia.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  We had first heard the Democrats were planning the confiscation checkpoints.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  Now they're saying it.
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  Now they try to get the National Guard to do it.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  They said no, obviously.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  Now the UN, which Loretta Lynch under Obama said they wanted under a strong cities initiative,
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  is hiring resettlement, internment, gun confiscators.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  That's in the ad, PapertsPowerfulNationalFile.com.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  And I knew National File was going to explode because he got a lot of writers from Breitbart,
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  Big League Politics, a lot of other places where he's written.
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  And it's only been around a few months.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  I love NationalFile.com.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  I visit DrudgeReport.com, M4s.com.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  I follow people's Twitter and stuff and I scan through the emails I get.
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  But I visit National File every few hours because he's just such a great team,
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  investigative journalists that are breaking such big stuff.
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  Now others have written about it.
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  Now Drudge is linked to a story about it today.
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  But I want to go over, after we talk about the general stuff that's currently happening,
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  the obvious big plan in Virginia.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  Now this year, starting this month, that they're hoping to foment.
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  And I want to get into the actual resettlement documents, the actual hiring in New York,
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  the actual Army document, FM3-39.40.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  Because listeners have to understand, when I'm rattling this stuff off,
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  I'm not making any of this up.
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  I know it sounds insane.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  But this is all stuff Obama put in place that Trump's trying to remove.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  So we're going to go to Papert for the rest of the hour here in a moment.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  But first I want to mention this little caveat that's good news.
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  Everybody knew that Fiona Hill was the head board member on Soros'
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  main mothership foundation with over 170 foundations under it.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  Everybody knew that she ran TheGlobalist.com.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  But no one would call her out when she got snuck in the White House two years ago, but us.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  Another reason they came after us.
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  Remember she told Congress a month ago, she doesn't know what globalism is, doesn't know George Soros.
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  She just is his foundation head, his main commander, his main general.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  Like Hitler didn't know who Joseph Goebbels was.
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  Or Batman doesn't know who Robin is.
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  I don't know, Daffy Duck doesn't know who Bugs Bunny is.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  I mean, the level is just staggering gaslighting.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  I have written letters to Trump that he's gotten.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  I have given him law firm reviews.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  I even had, well, I'm not going to say.
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  Let's just say I've had major current government officials give messages to the president.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  On what he's still about the censorship and the racketeering.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  And I just said fire everybody that was an ever-trumper and fire everybody in a five-minute search
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  that ever worked for the left or the neocons at the State Department because that's who runs the CIA and the whole damn thing.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  Well, he's doing it.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  Obama's National Security Council holdovers finally booted after years of nonstop leaks.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  And it goes through how he's just axing hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  Just 40 in just the last week from the National Security Council.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  And what has Potenac said on there?
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  You don't need a thousand people at the National Security Council.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  You maybe need 50.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  You imagine trying to make decisions on really complex stuff and that cacophony of people leaking and battling and screwing around and putting out this info.
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  You need real experts, maybe six people in a room like the Joint Chiefs.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  You don't need a hundred or a thousand like they've got.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  So hundreds and hundreds are getting fired.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  Anybody that ever worked for Soros is fired.
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  Fire all of them.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  And that's why the deep states really crap in their breaches.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  Trump finally with 300 days left.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  305 days is starting to do the right thing.
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  So we are now joined by a man who I will name Darth Papatine.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  Rise Darth Papatine, powerful Jedi, you had me come.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  This is big.
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  What's happening with Trump, but also they're clearly cooking up this witch's brew.
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  Betting everything on the craps table on one number.
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  On Charlottesville, on the Commonwealth, on martial law, hoping we take the bait.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  We don't want any violence.
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  If they try to come take guns, only in Virginia I'm saying, I would let them.
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  Only because it will show the guns being taken and it will politically kill them.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  If we start shooting back or let them trick us into it, they could start a civil war.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  Papert, what do you think?
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  Well, that's exactly right.
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  According to the ad, these people only move in after a conflict.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  So obviously we've seen all throughout the United States, they are desperately trying to gin up a conflict.
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  They're desperately trying to trick the right, some lunatic who happens to be a registered Republican into doing something stupid.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  Obviously you have massive, just disgusting mobs of leftists out on the streets as we saw in Charlottesville.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  And it's worth noting that one of the key people at Charlottesville promised that they would return to the city,
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  that they would make it a staging ground for all of their activism.
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  Meanwhile, they're trying to take the guns in the entire state of Virginia.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  You have the police saying that they will not let it happen.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  This, Alex, seems to be a perfect painting for conflict happening in the United States that would allow the UN,
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  which of course is hiring. They're hiring.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  If you have experience in paramilitary warfare or in political analysis, then you can get a job at the UN.
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  Alex, the only thing that gives me any little bit of hope regarding this story in front of us is the fact that the UN seems to be
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  admired in their own progressive politics because they want to have 50-50 male and female recruits.
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  They encourage women to apply and it says one of their key values is diversity.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  So that is a little bit of hope that these people are hopefully incompetent.
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  Well, that's right. But again, you only had one woman who turned out had a heart attack, very sad, in Charlottesville.
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  That turned into a mass murder that white supremacist carried out and Trump was behind it.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  If we get real conflict in Virginia, they're going to activate their antifa squads, their terrorists,
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  and really try to get the country burning down to drive Trump from power.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  That's their plan. I don't think it's going to go over well.
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  But the White House, the FBI, the American people, all of us have to be watchful
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  and we cannot let them get away with this because they admit this is what they're going to try to pull.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  Well, that's exactly what's going on. I mean, again, in Virginia, for some reason, they seem to have picked Virginia.
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  And it seems they have this plot. We've done the research. They have this outline that they follow.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  When they take a formerly Republican state, they move key population groups into big, dense cities.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  The big, dense cities outvote the rural populations and boom, it's a left-wing city.
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  It has a lot to do with immigration.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  And then they have classes with the rural areas, usually states, to then demonize the people they're taking over.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  Exactly. And now we're seeing what's happened. So Virginia has just barely been Democrat.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  It wasn't that long ago. It was considered a battleground state. It might be a battleground state, again, thanks to what they're doing.
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  And we know why it's happening. It's election fraud. So let's be clear.
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  The UN is officially hiring for gun confiscation. We're going to go over those documents and come back.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  But first, Tom, you have been involved in some violence yourself. We have footage of this and I want to decry this right now as we go to break.
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  You actually were in Charlottesville and you did actually attack some of the peaceful Antifa.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  And we're going to go ahead and show what you did. Here it is.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  Tom, you've got better makeup on now, though. Tom Papperteen in the...
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  Papperteen. I am now doubting...
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  What can I say? I don't actually have lights.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  Darth Papperteen.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  Do you like being known as Darth Papperteen now?
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  I think it's a good nickname. These aren't actually lights behind me. It's all the force, by the way.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  That's right. We'll be right back with Lord Papperteen.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  It was about three and a half months ago and I said on air, I'm going to religiously take my supplements.
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  I'd always taken them in the past, but I forget like everybody else to stay on the regimen.
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  Well, I've done it and I've lost 39 pounds in less than four months and my life is so amazing.
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  And I still have cake and ice cream and pie, just like I did before.
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  I'm exercising the same amount, but my body has the trace elements and the key things it needs,
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  like the clean iodine and X2 and X3.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  And I take a good energy booster like turbo force and brain force for my brain.
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  And I take the fish oil and I take the turmeric and I take the knockout and I use the good toothpaste.
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  It's fluoride free. It's got the tea tree oil and so much more at infowarslive.com.

[1:45:57.000 --> 1:45:59.000]  Andy in Florida. Thank you, Andy. Go ahead.
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  Hey, Alex. I love you, man. We love you.
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  Before I go ahead and talk about the topic on hand, I got to talk about one of your product.
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:11.000]  A little bit about me. I'm 245 pounds. I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:14.000]  and make a long story short. I used to have a problem with Adderall.
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  I do have ADHD, but, you know, I was taking Adderall for its energy boosting properties.
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  You know, I kind of got a little out of hand and, you know, I listen to you religiously in my truck every day.
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  So I tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche. This product changed my life.
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:29.000]  But turbo force really changed my life.
[1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  It was a day I no longer take Adderall and I get by literally 13 hours a day.
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  I work on a half of a packet of your turbo force and if you take a half a packet,
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:42.000]  that's literally a dollar a day and you save so much money versus, you know, a monster,
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  which is what 499 and I, you know, I just had to call in and tell you guys how great turbo force is.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  And if anybody's on the fence, they really have to try it.
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  We're really proud of turbo force. So thank you sir.
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  Commit to buy a lot of your products at M4store.com.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:47:18.000]  Then help us spread the word. Let's just get busy. M4store.com.
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  Tom Emperor-Paperteen is our guest. Seriously.
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  I'm very excited that the Domino's are falling against the globalist.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  America and the world's waking up.
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  I've been talking to a lot of people from the UK and Europe and they say everybody's awake to the New World Order now.
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  Now, election fraud is massive. The third world invasion operation is dangerous.
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  And they're taking a lot of cities over and turning them blue.
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  And then with election fraud, they never go back.
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  So things are bad, but intellectually, spiritually, culturally, people are really waking up right now to this takeover and rejecting it.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  Now, Mike Adams has written a new big story that boils all this down.
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  We just posted it to M4Wars.com.
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  U.N. hiring disarmament officers to conduct field missions.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  These are quotes in New York as U.N. occupation plan for America goes live.
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  Now, he boils it all down. Loretta Lynch calling for it five years ago. All of this.
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  This is the globalist counter. No borders, no walls, no U.S.A. at all.
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  The Russia gate failed. Their Ukraine gate thing has failed so far, but they've got impeachment now just waiting.
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  I warned Trump to get it done quickly. See, I knew.
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  The Democrats are holding it because they're going to build up, I said, a racial clash in America to use that with the background of the impeachment ongoing to say, oh, we have new articles, drive them out.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  And you see it all coming into focus right now.
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  Why have the impeachments passed but waiting?
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  She says they may wait months, have more they pass than during a national crisis.
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  Move it forward using atrocities of staged events, black on white, white on black events.
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  That the media is trying to hype.
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  That's why they're saying whites are inherently battle over the news.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  That's why all this is being pushed.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  Tom Pappert of the NationalFile.com.
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  People are really getting this and they're really getting when the governor says, yeah, we may use the military to take the guns and yeah, we're going to have checkpoints and yeah, we're going to register you.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  They're wanting to push it.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  That's why O'Rourke was saying, hell, yeah, we're going to take all your guns.
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  They now realize they're politically going to lose and are now moving towards, I believe, the Civil War model.
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  We've known that's been a plan for a while, but it looks like that's one of their only hubs right now.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  What do you think?
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  I think you're exactly right, Alex.
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  I mean, even look at Virginia where, as you said, I threw a combination of election fraud and mass immigration as well as Democrats fleeing their terrible states and going to one to ruin it.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  We are seeing Virginia now competitive polling for President Trump.
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  In fact, he's beating every single Democrat.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  The only one who comes close is Joe Biden in Virginia.
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  That article is on NationalFile.com.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  So this is all slipping out of their hands.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  You're absolutely correct.
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  People are waking up all around the globe.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  We have correspondence in South America, in the UK, all across the planet, and everywhere you look, there is a massive populist uprising.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  So what do they do?
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  They fight back tooth and nail.
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  Just as you said, they're staging obviously some type of conflict in this country.
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  It seems to be inevitable at this point to some.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  And it's like you said, Alex, it's going to happen in Virginia.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  You have over 100 different counties now saying they will refuse to confiscate guns.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  You have Virginia Governor Blackface Baby Killer, Northam, going in and saying that if you do not take the guns, we're going to take your pensions away and you're going to be fired.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  They're clearly gearing up.
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  And then meanwhile, not that far away, especially when you've got a UN helicopter, they're hiring people for the express purpose of disarmament and reintegration of civilians.
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  So they go in and they take your guns from a deep red state turned blue like Virginia.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  They put you in a camp for who knows how long while they reprogram you and teach you how to be a good little civilian.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  I mean, it is very, it's, it reeks of desperation, Alex.
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  It reeks of ignorance that all of this is on the UN website.
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  You and I get, I mean, that's how we found it.
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  It was sent to us as a tip.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  We looked it up.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  We verified it.
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  We found what the agencies do and we wrote it.
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  But at the same time, they would not be doing this if it wasn't for the situation becoming dire from the globalist perspective.
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  And I want to be clear.
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  When you read FM 3-39.40, it dovetails perfectly.
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  This is official UN army policy under Obama that was leaked to us by the army.
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  By the way, I'll just tell you that they said at the time, go ahead and tell folks where it came from.
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  It came out of Fort Hood.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  They want everybody to know.
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  And now it's being done again.
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:01.000]  People say, well, Trump's the president.
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  They've still got most of the bureaucracy.
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  And so this is their counter strike, teaming up with the Chai comms, teaming up with the UN.
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  What did Larry Grathwald learn from the weatherman?
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  The same plan.
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  What does the Washington Post say?
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  We need Xi to destroy Donald Trump.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  What did Reuters say?
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  At Davos, Xi Jinping said, we will destroy Trump.
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  We will destroy America.
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  This is their plan.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:28.000]  Again, it doesn't mean they'll get away with it.
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  But everyone should turn against the Democrats in the deep state, allied with the Chai comms and other evil groups.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  This is outrageous.
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  And it's not even for the average person's interest to join against America and their bill of rights and constitutions.
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:43.000]  You talk about useful idiots.
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  This is a next level useful idiot.
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  That's what Lenin called idiots that supported communism, even though it destroyed them.
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  Well, that's precisely what these people are.
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  And that's what the Democrat Party loves.
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  They love these people who are just rabidly anti-Trump.
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  They are filled with hate.
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  They have no logic.
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  They have no type of brain activity left whatsoever.
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  They're only filled with hate.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  But Alex, I want to hone in on something because we have gotten some criticism saying, well, Trump wouldn't allow this.
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  He's the president.
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  He's a good president.
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  And I agree.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  President Trump probably, I mean, he, he's, this is being hidden from him.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  We used said just earlier in the show.
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  President Trump does not run the United Nations.
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  Go ahead, sorry.
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  Right.
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  Well, and it's happening under his nose in his home state of New York, no less.
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  But you're right.
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  He doesn't own the United Nations.
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  He doesn't run the United Nations.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  And I'm sure that if he has it within his power, he will do something to stop this from happening, to stop the conflict.
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  The Democrats and the globalists so clearly want to.
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  Trump, you just hit the nail in the head though.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  Without us.
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  This is a process of brainwashing.
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  Loretta Lynch calls for the UN to take over police departments across the country.
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  They have one bad shooting or one question thing.
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:49.000]  That was official.
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  There's video over saying it.
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  Anybody can pull up the article.
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  Strong Cities Initiative.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  Breitbart wrote about it.
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  We did.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  Now you have them all doing it again.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  But then it's so outrageous.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  People go, well, there's no way that can be true.
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  But then they're actually trying it.
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  So, so that's the thing about this.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  Yes, it's hard to believe that over 10,000 children as young as five years old in the US have had their genitals already cut off.
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  It's been done.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  It's accelerating.
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  All this is crazy.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  I agree.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  It's hard to believe what's happening, but it is.
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  That is, that's incredibly accurate.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:27.000]  I mean, what's happening, it seems to be accelerating at levels that nobody could have predicted.
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  I mean, you sit there and you think, how did Drag Queen Story Hours become the new mission of the LGBTQ movement?
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  You know, don't kill gays.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  Totally with you on that.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  Maybe let them get married.
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  Not so sure.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  Maybe a legal marriage.
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  Maybe not a Christian marriage.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  But now it's let a four-year-old child sit on a sexual predator's lap and dance.
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  That's where we're at at this point.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  And it is hard for folks to understand this.
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  I can certainly agree.
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  But Alex, I'm sitting here in the Midwest.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  I know you're down in Texas where it's getting a little bit worse.
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  But when you go to the coast, when you get out of what is really the grassroots of America and you see how evil these places are,
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  you land in a place like L.A. or in Washington, D.C.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  Oh, it's like zombie and the attitude and the vibe is horrible.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  That's exactly right.
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  And it's not hard to see these people thinking that they're going to get away with it.
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  They are so mired in their tiny little bubble that they see an article like this,
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  a U.N. office putting out a job application for who knows how many employees with government, with paramilitary.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  These are former Blackwater people that they're trying to hire.
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  To them, it's just another day at the office.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  To us out here in real America, it's shocking.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  It's devastating.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  It's unbelievable.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  But it's really a tale of two Americas, Alex.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  And people ask, why would they try that here?
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  Because it's worked everywhere else.
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  And I want to do five more minutes with you.
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  Then we have a guest joining us, Leo Sakami, with big news as well.
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  And another guest who's a South African marching across the U.S.
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  to bring attention to the extermination of whites going on in South Africa
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  and the government openly helping carry it out.
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the New World Order.
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  We're all exposing this and fighting against any racial group,
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  attacking and killing another group for what color they are.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  We stand against it, whether it's the Nazis that are mainly run by
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  the Southern Property Law Center in ADL, literally,
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  or whether it's the Black groups funded by the communists
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  killing whites all over Africa.
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  We're going to come back and break all this down.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  Please don't forget.
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  The only way we can stand in the face of the demonization
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  and the attacks and the kangaroo courts and all of it
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  and continue to fight the globalists with what you see on the surface
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  and a lot of stuff behind the scenes that we don't take credit for.
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  For a lot of reasons, Info Wars is bigger and more powerful
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  than folks even know it.
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  I'm just going to leave it at that, that your money's being well spent.
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  I need a lot of it.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  Okay, and I don't have enough to do a lot of stuff I want to do.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  I need you to go to InfoWarsStore.com at the best deals we've ever had.
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  It's only extended for like four more days.
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  The year-end specials up to 70% off, 75% off.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  Storewide free shipping, double-patriot points up to 50% off.
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  On the apparel, you can call toll-free, triple-A, 253-3139
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  and order via the phone, triple-A, 253-3139.
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  There's a PO box and address right there on the shopping cart as well,
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  but that's how we fund ourselves and we are doing incredible work
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  and we are fighting harder than we've ever fought.
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  You see what our reporters are doing.
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  You see what our crews are doing.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  You see the other great reporters we have on helping magnify the great work
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  they're doing at National File and now that's on Drudge.
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  We're doing this together, but it takes money to do it
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  and we can get so much more done if you just finance our operations
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  so take action in the war now.
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  Sign up for auto-ship initial 10% off and get your coffee,
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  get your toothpaste, get your fish oil.
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  Get it all at infowarstore.com. It's 2020.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  It's time for action.
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:48.000]  So what's the most important part?
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  Let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist.
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front.
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount and that's my allegor.
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:58:02.000]  Paraboforce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:05.000]  with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy
[1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:08.000]  that last for ten hours in the average metabolic system,
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  metabolism of a human.
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:11.000]  Some people get 15 hours out of this, some people get about eight hours,
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  but people take this, people are taking sports,
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:17.000]  people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not pipe.
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts,
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  their post-workouts, you can call us whatever you want.
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  It's a total solution all around the best you're going to find.
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:29.000]  Turboforce, without you we don't roll.
[1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:31.000]  With you we search forward together.
[1:58:31.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  You support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind.
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  It's a win-win, 360 together.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:59:10.000]  InfoWarsStore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:14.000]  You can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus.
[1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:17.000]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  It's incredible.
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:19.000]  So do yourself a favor.
[1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:22.000]  Try out the products if you've been on the fence.
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  You can't lose except if you don't take action.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:29.000]  Because when you buy the products, you're funding the operation that is always delivering
[1:59:29.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  thanks to your support and God's grace in our action.
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  But you need these products.
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:37.000]  That's the real reason you want to get them is because they're amazing.
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:44.000]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO instead of imploding.
[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:46.000]  We're fighting to win and we are winning.
[1:59:46.000 --> 2:00:15.000]  Thanks to you.
[2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:27.000]  The vaunted, hated, dreaded InfoWars is live.
[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  Wild horses couldn't drag me away.
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:37.000]  Big movements inside the Vatican.
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:39.000]  As the Pope says, there is no hell.
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  Open the borders.
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:43.000]  Slapping a woman in public.
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  A lot of big developments with the globalist Pope will be talking to Leo Sagami coming up.
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  Tom Papert, Mike Adams, ExcellentNaturalNews.com article is on newswars.com.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  And it boils down with you broke and others.
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:01:01.000]  But he adds the U.N. officially calling for the occupation of the U.S.
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  The left calling for them to take the guns.
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  Examples of the State Department wanting that.
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  How this is what the U.N. does around the world.
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  Very important big article.
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  U.N. hiring disarmament officers to conduct field missions in New York as U.N. occupation plan for America goes live.
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  They have a U.N. affiliated funded group microchipping homeless in Florida and Texas.
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  That's all confirmed.
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  So the U.N. is like a bureaucracy.
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  Social justice warrior, community organizer, Barack Obama type stuff.
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  That's how it just oozes in.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:33.000]  They call it mutualization.
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  How they take over your local cities so they can't get your central government.
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  Schwarzenegger when they couldn't get the carbon taxes through and Trump got elected said,
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  we need to mobilize and work directly with the cities.
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  We need to bypass Congress and the president.
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  This is a takeover.
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  People say, oh, it's ridiculous, but it's not military at first.
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:55.000]  But the fact that now they're just last month in Idaho, there's video.
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:02:01.000]  And in Salt Lake City, all of a sudden they've taken over a building in the U.N.'s arm.
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  They say, this is now U.N. territory.
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  Get back to the press.
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  This is really going on, Tom.
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  Well, that's exactly what's going on.
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  I mean, we all saw that video.
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  It was shocking at the time and now it seems humdrum.
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:13.000]  That's how fast things move.
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  But it was literally a hotel or a convention center in Salt Lake City where they take it over and they say,
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:19.000]  no, this is the U.N. now.
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  Out there, that's the United States.
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  This is the U.N.
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  We control this.
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  Well, that's what happens in New York.
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:27.000]  That's what happens when they hire these people.
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  And you're right, Alex, we should have gone further into detail in our article.
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  We just wanted to get the news out as fast as possible.
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  But this has been a long time coming.
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  Hey, you broke that like four or five days ago and now it's a top story out there.
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  Great job.
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  We've got to initialize it to make sure it happens and everybody else gets it.
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  Right.
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  Well, that's exactly how this whole process works.
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  And this has been a process since the early days of the Obama administration.
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  This has all been building.
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  And only now, now that they have what they consider to be a hostile person to their ideology in the White House,
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  are they bringing it to fruition.
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:02:59.000]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  This has all been stored in the tank, waiting and ready to go for years.
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  And they do this to other countries all the time.
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  So this is a real plan.
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  It doesn't mean it's going to succeed.
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  But it's like that anti-full page article in the New York Times,
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  overthrow Pence, Trump driving from power.
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  They're going to try that this year.
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  We're now in 2020.
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:19.000]  That's right.
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  Now, Alex, I just want to say after a long 2019, I want to congratulate you.
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  Another article we have up is, of course, you were the biggest podcast of 2019.
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  And if you do the number crunching, the most listened to podcast of all time,
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  which is really just a symbol of how many people in this country and everywhere throughout the globe
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  are waking up, waking up past the globalist indoctrination and wanting to hear the truth.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  So congratulations, my friend.
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  That is truly impressive.
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  That's the listeners and people that are interested in the truth.
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  And I'm telling you, the dominos are falling towards the tyrants.
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  They are in big trouble, but they're going to strike back.
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  So do what must be done, Lord Papet.
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  Show no mercy. The globalists are relentless.
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  Trump needs to take action and he's starting to fire all these Soros people right now.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  So it's finally happening.
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:12.000]  That's exactly what's happening.
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  And it's very encouraging to see.
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  I know you and I have both been frustrated with the president on some issues.
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  He's doing a lot.
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  He's doing as much as he can.
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  And it looks like now finally, if the leaks stop, if we can stop finding out everything that's happening
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  in the White House two days earlier than we should because of these Obama holdovers,
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  we'll know that he was successful.
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  Darth Papatine.
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  Lord Papatine.
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  There you go, NationalFile.com, folks.
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:41.000]  Be sure and check it out daily.
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  Tom, you're awesome. Thank you so much.
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:45.000]  Thank you, Alex. It's always a pleasure.
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  We've got the jump on them trying to start martial law.
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  You dirty, filthy Soros commies.
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  We know everything. You're up to filth.
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:05:02.000]  As I drive in to the Central Texas Information Warfare Command Center in
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:06.000]  Austin, Texas, it is January 2nd, 2020.
[2:05:06.000 --> 2:05:14.000]  And you only have four days left as of me taping this to take advantage of the biggest sales in the history of
[2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:23.000]  M4s, which we've escalated in the last year to sell out of all of our inventory to fund ourselves into 2020
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:26.000]  and to be able to avoid inventory taxes.
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  We are selling out of almost everything right now or have already sold out many of our best-selling items.
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  We have store-wide free shipping.
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  We have double pay-tree of points and up to 75% off.
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:44.000]  Take advantage of these deals on your favorite products at M4sLife.com.
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:48.000]  That's up to 50% off on apparel, water filtration, air filtration and so much more.
[2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:51.000]  But whatever you do, take action at M4sLife.com.
[2:05:51.000 --> 2:05:53.000]  Get great products and fund the M4.
[2:05:53.000 --> 2:06:11.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:11.000 --> 2:06:21.000]  I wanted to get Leo Zagami on one of the first new shows of 2020.
[2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  Best-selling author, talk show host of Zone Right.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:29.000]  He's just to talk about the pedophile rings that are being exposed.
[2:06:29.000 --> 2:06:31.000]  He's control of the Vatican.
[2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  What's happening with this Jesuit Pope that he first exposed six, seven years ago and said would be the Pope.
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:39.000]  He said they would have it where popes don't die anymore.
[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  They just leave office. You can even have multiple popes at the same time.
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:45.000]  The first time I ever heard this, he's totally on target.
[2:06:45.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  He said to leave Italy because he's been a political prisoner over there.
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:52.000]  We're going to talk to him about the Pope saying there is no hell.
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  The Pope saying open your borders to Islam.
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:57.000]  But don't open the Vatican up though.
[2:06:57.000 --> 2:06:59.000]  You talk about demonic folks.
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:01.000]  This is just getting out of control.
[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:03.000]  He just recently said it again.
[2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:05.000]  So how is that affecting the Catholic Church?
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:07.000]  This is a big deal.
[2:07:07.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  But before we go any further, please don't forget this broadcast is lizard supported.
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  We have a lot of really important initiatives that we want to be able to carry out.
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:18.000]  A lot of different operations in 2020.
[2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:19.000]  2020 is here.
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:21.000]  305 days left to the election.
[2:07:21.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  We need capital.
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:25.000]  Plus, these are great products you need.
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:27.000]  Everybody asks, Alex, why don't you ever get sick?
[2:07:27.000 --> 2:07:29.000]  I mean, I get sore throats and stuff from allergies.
[2:07:29.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  That's about it.
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  I haven't been sick in four, five, six years.
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:35.000]  I can't remember the last time I had a fever.
[2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  I've been in a lot of places and I've had flu season record levels.
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  Knock on wood.
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:42.000]  Hope it doesn't happen to me.
[2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:45.000]  But, I mean, I eat high quality supplements.
[2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:47.000]  I eat a lot of garlic.
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:49.000]  And I just knock on wood.
[2:07:49.000 --> 2:07:51.000]  I just don't get sick like that.
[2:07:51.000 --> 2:07:55.000]  And I've always had a good Constitution, but I'd still get a fever every couple years.
[2:07:55.000 --> 2:07:56.000]  Man, it's four or five.
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:07:58.000]  I can't remember the last time I had a fever.
[2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  Can't remember the last time I was puking my guts out with any type of stomach bugging.
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:05.000]  And the more they vaccinate people, the more people get the flu.
[2:08:05.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  That's been documented.
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:10.000]  So, now is the time to fortify your body.
[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:13.000]  And if you don't have the X2 and the X3, if you don't have the DNA force,
[2:08:13.000 --> 2:08:19.000]  if you don't take a good probiotic like our fluorolife and our MycoZX,
[2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:21.000]  you don't have those front lines of defense in your body.
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  And I can just tell you, I work hard.
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:29.000]  Everybody knows for a long time I stopped working out and did nothing for 15 years.
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  In the last 10 years, I've been slowly getting back in shape.
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  I mean, I've got more stamina, more libido, more energy.
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  And in the new year, I'm just committing to myself that I'm going to take the supplements
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  that help flush my body out in ForrestLive.com.
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  I'm going to take the supplements that help me have more energy and stamina,
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  like turbo force and rain force.
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  And the more I remember to take the fish oil, the krill,
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  the more I remember to take knockout at night.
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:52.000]  I had better sleep.
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:57.000]  These are all compounds and things that aren't in the soil anymore,
[2:08:57.000 --> 2:08:59.000]  that aren't in most of the plants and food anymore.
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  And when you get these things, they just supercharge you.
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  And it funds this operation, so it's a total 360 win.
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:10.000]  So double Patriot points, store-wide free shipping, 50% off on the peril.
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  All of it has to end in four days.
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  We'll have some new specials, but not as massive as this.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:19.000]  So please take advantage of it while those sales are still going.
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  Now, going to Leo Zagami of leozagami.com.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  Leo, I appreciate you popping in on short notice.
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  I just wanted to get your waterfront snapshot into 2020,
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  what you expect to be coming, what you expect to be going on.
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  Huge awakenings we're seeing in Europe against globalism.
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:39.000]  The same thing here, but they're going to try to counter-strike.
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  What's front and center on your radar?
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:47.000]  Well, thank you for having me on and happy new year to everybody.
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:51.000]  I think that, of course, we are seeing in Europe a complete change
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:56.000]  towards populism, but at the same time we have this resistance
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  from the technocrats who are, of course, playing dirty
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  and they are not accepting the democratic vote.
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  We have seen it recently in Italy where in September
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  they overflowed the populist government and substituted
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  with the usual friends of Hillary Clinton.
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:17.000]  And so we have a lot of similarities with what is going on here
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  in the United States. There is some kind of thread
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  between what is happening in Europe and what is happening
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  in the United States, but also what is happening in the church
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  because the Catholic church is becoming increasingly a political vessel
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  and the pope is becoming also known as a political figure.
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  So this is what we're going to see in 2020.
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  More of the pope getting involved in politics,
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  more of this sabotage of populist and sovereignty parties
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  that want to go back to tradition and to conservative values.
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:00.000]  We have also seen that Matteo Salvini has immediately criticized
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  the pope for his move just in New Year's Eve,
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:09.000]  which has shown the world once again the hypocrisy of this figure
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:13.000]  because after making anomaly on helping others,
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:18.000]  being understanding and all that, he simply treated one of the faithful
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:23.000]  in St. Peter's Square like dirt, showing to the world his real face,
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:26.000]  which is of course the face of evil.
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  Regarding here the United States, we have some change in the local laws
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  in the state of California that will bring the ready piling up
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  a bunch of cases of lawsuits when it comes to sex abuse against the Catholic church
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:47.000]  and we have even the advisor to Mother Teresa
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  that is now being accused of raping the same boy for a thousand times.
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  A thousand times.
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:12:00.000]  Robert J. Gilbert filed a suit on the state court in California on Monday
[2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  because of these new laws.
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  So McGuire, he's the Jesuit priest who died, unfortunately, in 2017,
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  will not be punishable personally, but of course there will be money
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  that the Catholic church will have to give for these cases
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  and that will also bring another big problem in the fold.
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  But for 2020, I see definitely a year that is turning point.
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  We can either go the direction of freedom of an American renaissance,
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  which we have talked about in the past with you, Alex, when I was in Austin,
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  or otherwise we can go towards instead a very wrong direction,
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  the direction of civil war, of civil arrest,
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  and that, of course, is something that we hope will not happen.
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  So our prayers are for the President of the United States
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  in this very delicate moment in history.
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  The fate of the globalist really is burning to the ground
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  and even the top trends out of major publications say the 2020s of the year,
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:05.000]  and globalism becomes super unpopular and falls apart,
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  but out of that comes the chai comms, the city-states, and the economic warfare.
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:15.000]  I mean, these people are not defeated yet when they say globalism is falling apart.
[2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  How would you describe the real climate geopolitically right now?
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  Well, the geopolitical climate is actually reflecting more and more the religious climate,
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  this never-ending war against Christians,
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  this is getting harsher even in China,
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  where we see rules and new rules against Christians all the time,
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:42.000]  aside from the Catholic Church who has now made a deal with communist China.
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  But this is a spiritual war, Alex,
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  and then, of course, from this spiritual war emanates a political confrontation
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  with the progressive liberal forces, which are, of course, endorsing pure evil,
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  because that's what they're doing, and I think it's pretty clear now,
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  even for everybody who's watching us, that the lies of the mainstream media
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  are really not enough to tell us.
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:11.000]  I agree with this. Let me ask you that.
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  Why are they coming out in the open saying, okay, we are Satanists,
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  okay, we do abuse children, and we're gonna get you, and we are liars?
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  I mean, why are they trying to scare us, make us give up, normalize it?
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:24.000]  What are they doing?
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  We have announced a couple of years ago that Trump was really on the case
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  with fighting pedophilia, and he has demonstrated that there is an ongoing war
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  with pedophilia, not only in the Catholic Church, but in many other institutions,
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  everywhere, really, in politics everywhere.
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  And so this war is annoying the enemy, which now wants to normalize their perversion.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  The more they get exposed and the more they arrest them,
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:51.000]  then in the end they want to normalize this whole thing,
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:57.000]  because it's a little bit like the prohibition on drugs for them.
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  But it's a very different issue, because, I mean, you are talking about the abuse of children,
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  and they want to normalize it through constant reiteration on Hollywood media.
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:12.000]  That's right. They know it's all coming out,
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  so they're desperately trying to desensitize this, hoping that somehow
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  they don't get in trouble when it all comes out.
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  Well, of course, the New York Times and the mainstream media is just saying,
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:23.000]  oh, it's another sickness. It's another disease.
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:25.000]  We have to treat it like that.
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  Oh, poor guy. Well, he shouldn't have...
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:34.000]  In the end, we have had, at the end of December, coming out an incredible news.
[2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  Here there is a guy who was abused, a 19-year-old boy in France
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  who shoveled the crucifix down the throat of a priest.
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:45.000]  Let's talk about that in the latest. Jeffrey Epstein knows.
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:49.000]  Or even mainstream news is admitting she's an Israeli operative. Stay with us. We'll be back.
[2:16:16.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  The money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets,
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:22.000]  not a security IPO or note.
[2:16:22.000 --> 2:16:26.000]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:34.000]  Don't miss this one. Stake your claim today.
[2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:40.000]  Call 800-600-3388. That's 800-600-3388.
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:45.000]  Call now 800-600-3388.
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:47.000]  800-600-3388.
[2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:17:13.000]  before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:23.000]  This is Black Rifle Real Estate dot com.
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:18:01.000]  I keep my eye on the news all the time, but I miss the fact that in late 2019,
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:13.000]  just about two weeks ago, the CDC and the FDA approved live Ebola vaccine to be given inside the United States.
[2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:20.000]  It is an experimental vaccine. It is live. It's not even attenuated.
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:24.000]  They've just genetically modified it, so it's supposedly not lethal.
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:30.000]  Same stuff they did with the Gardasil vaccine that's admittedly killed a name so many.
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:32.000]  This is just crazy.
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:39.000]  And the Congos had the biggest outbreaks of Ebola ever since they started giving the vaccine there in the last few years.
[2:18:39.000 --> 2:18:45.000]  They had orders up here and letting people in un-thetted the Democrats distribute across the country.
[2:18:45.000 --> 2:18:52.000]  You cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity, and it is an attempted Ebola assault on America.
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:55.000]  This is the New World Order.
[2:18:55.000 --> 2:19:01.000]  It's either happened to every person listening or it's happened to someone you know.
[2:19:01.000 --> 2:19:10.000]  Everybody is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu have taken the flu vaccine right before they get it,
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:15.000]  and that they get the worst case of the flu of their life.
[2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:24.000]  But still, like concentration camp victims, they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics to get the injections.
[2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:30.000]  It doesn't matter that studies, mainline government studies in Canada and Europe show that when you take the flu vaccine,
[2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:35.000]  it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season by lowering your immunity.
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:37.000]  It goes on and on.
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:45.000]  Or the fact that the governments have never guessed the next year's mutation that the flu vaccine has never, ever even worked.
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:47.000]  But how do you prop up a hoax?
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:49.000]  You keep the giant hoax going.
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:20:01.000]  No wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on record happening right now.
[2:20:19.000 --> 2:20:39.000]  Hoax is going to host the fourth hour, but in the last second of this hour, I'm going to hit a bowl of news that is so staggering, so incredible,
[2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:42.000]  that I can't believe it's actually happening.
[2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:45.000]  And of course, you're going to hear it here first.
[2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:55.000]  It's the full assault on the Western world with disease, with unwashed masses, with all of it to bring us down to collapse things.
[2:20:55.000 --> 2:20:57.000]  And Trump is battling to keep it propped up.
[2:20:57.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  It doesn't mean it's good how he's doing it with the fiat money, but we're damned if we do, we're really damned if we don't.
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:06.000]  And I don't know how Trump's going to navigate us out of this.
[2:21:06.000 --> 2:21:07.000]  I know he's trying.
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  I know I'm trying.
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:13.000]  I know we've all just got to be active and spread the word because we could lose everything financially.
[2:21:13.000 --> 2:21:15.000]  What matters is ideology.
[2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  If we have Americana, if we have Renaissance, we could rebuild the country easily.
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:23.000]  It's the psychic attack, the spiritual attack that really matters.
[2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  I want to get into the record numbers.
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:27.000]  I mean, it's over a tenfold increase.
[2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:31.000]  They admit of pedophiles, people with kidnapped children being busted.
[2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  It's happening all over the world.
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:39.000]  And now you have Maxwell, the girlfriend of Epstein, who was this big handler.
[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:44.000]  Even the Daily Mail has the headline that she's an Israeli intelligence op in Israel.
[2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:47.000]  So that's a big deal that this is coming out.
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:49.000]  These groups all blackmail each other.
[2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:53.000]  What factions in control of the Vatican right now, Leo, from your research?
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:55.000]  And how does that tie into the other factions?
[2:21:55.000 --> 2:21:56.000]  Who are the factions?
[2:21:56.000 --> 2:21:59.000]  I know you've been, and it's not a bad thing.
[2:21:59.000 --> 2:22:01.000]  You've been public about it, and you're a Christian.
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:04.000]  You've renounced some of it because you didn't know what you were getting into.
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:08.000]  You've been in what really is Illuminati organizations in Rome.
[2:22:08.000 --> 2:22:09.000]  I mean, the real deal.
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  So who are the power players?
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:14.000]  Because for me, all the groups just confuse it.
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:17.000]  There's some good, some bad, and all the groups, because a lot of them get the seed getting into them.
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  It really matters your personal relationship with Christ.
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:21.000]  Don't you agree?
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:22.000]  Absolutely.
[2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  And the groups are basically the Jesuits and the Sabati and Frank is within the Jewish community,
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:33.000]  which are heretics basically, but they're still ongoing and they have immense power.
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:40.000]  For them, 2020 is a very important year because it has a special symbology.
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  You see 2020 in the Kabbalah and also in a vast number of symbolism that really puts together this year
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:52.000]  with a turning point for mankind.
[2:22:52.000 --> 2:22:55.000]  I mean, it's not a normal year.
[2:22:55.000 --> 2:23:04.000]  I just received a document from a Masonic grandmaster a few days ago talking about the symbology of 2020
[2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:09.000]  that it was connected with the apocalypse, with the end of times, with the end times.
[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:15.000]  And of course, this is a link, which is unusual, especially for a Masonic grandmaster.
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  But it also-
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:17.000]  Exactly.
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:21.000]  So the iconography, the numerology of 2020, describe that more.
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:25.000]  We should do a whole show on this, I mean, to mystery school religions,
[2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:28.000]  which goes back to Solomon's Temple, back to Egypt, back to Babylon.
[2:23:28.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  It's all the same groups, where it's Masonic, Jewish, as you said, Islamic,
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:36.000]  all of its roots as the secret society element.
[2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  What do they think 2020 is in numerology?
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:47.000]  Well, they think that it represents the duality of two opposing factions at work.
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:56.000]  And of course, we have seen also what is happening with the weather, with everything else.
[2:23:56.000 --> 2:24:04.000]  But all of this is not connected to climate change, but rather to something very occult, which is ongoing.
[2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:05.000]  You see, Pythagoras-
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:08.000]  Can you feel the spiritual energy increasing exponentially?
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:09.000]  Absolutely.
[2:24:09.000 --> 2:24:10.000]  And I'm on fire right now.
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  I'm on fire right now.
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:19.000]  I mean, Alex, Pythagoras, who is so as this immense figure philosopher,
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  Pythagoras said that the numbers are so important to really understand where we are now.
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:32.000]  And we are in a year that symbolizes what Pythagoras called the tetractis,
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:36.000]  which is also connected to the holy name of God.
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:41.000]  So there is here both, if you go into the study of Kabbal-
[2:24:41.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  It's an infinity symbol.
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:44.000]  So it's a gate backwards and forwards.
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:46.000]  It's a snake eating itself.
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  It's a portal.
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  It's a portal.
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  It's a portal.
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:55.000]  And like we said at the beginning of the show, it can go either one direction or the other.
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:25:03.000]  Because you see, the number 20 can go, especially at this moment of time,
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:10.000]  we see how it's reflecting, especially in politics, these cyclic events that take place.
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  The 1920s were not really a great time for for mankind, Alex.
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  So we saw the beginning of fascism in Italy.
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  We saw Adolf Hitler putting the first, you know,
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  sitting basically what became after grown up to be Nazism a few years later.
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:36.000]  I mean, if history repeats itself, we are in front of a decade that will change the fate of mankind.
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  And it's nothing is going to be ever like before.
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  In 10 years from now, our children, our youth could lose control of their brain to artificial intelligence.
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:51.000]  And this is the great war for human destinies here.
[2:25:51.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  We're at the center of a crosspoint, a jump point of opportunity.
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:57.000]  This is the crossroads.
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:00.000]  We are now entering the planetary alignment.
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:08.000]  We are entering a planetary alignment, and there is what in Judaism is called the Rodesh,
[2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  which is the divine name of it.
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  And so we are in front of a positive thing because we know, like the Christians know,
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:24.000]  that in the end of the day, we're going to have some kind of revelation that will bring together
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  for those who, of course, will survive the next 10 years.
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  So how do you then focus on the good that's happening instead of all the bad that's about to come out?
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  Because it's good that bad's coming out, so it stops or it gets cut back.
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:41.000]  But we don't want to worship that by focusing on it too much.
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:44.000]  I feel like we need to focus on the good that's also happening.
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:52.000]  Yes, and I think that the symbology of 2020 will increase the psychic energy.
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  So we can use our own psychic energy with our own prayers towards a positive outcome.
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:01.000]  And we are all working for that.
[2:27:01.000 --> 2:27:07.000]  And there is people who are waking up even in places like Hollywood or inside the Vatican.
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  I think that in the coming year, it's possible.
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  Well, in this year that has just started, we could see a schism within the Catholic Church
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:25.000]  because there is more and more rumors that the U.S. Catholic Church wants to break up with Rome.
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:28.000]  Let's come back and briefly talk about that.
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  Because as you said, it's the year of Revelation.
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:31.000]  It's the year of awakening.
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  It's the year of cataclysms, schisms.
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:35.000]  This is going to be an explosive year.
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  And you did what I do, too.
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:38.000]  You're like, in the coming year, no, it's here.
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  We're now two days in.
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:45.000]  So we're 333 days right now.
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  No, 363 days right now.
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  But an amazing time, 305 days out from the election.
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  This is, we've got one minute to break, but tell folks briefly about your latest book.
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  My latest book is about the times we are living.
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:07.000]  So it's about what we are talking about today and everything that has been going on behind the scenes.
[2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:13.000]  The connections between the Sabati and Frankis and the Jesuits are unveiled for the first time.
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  So we don't because it's important here that we don't stigmatize Jews.
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:21.000]  There is so much antisemitism going on.
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:23.000]  We need to have clarity.
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  We need to understand that even the Jewish world, like the Christian world, suffered heresies.
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:34.000]  Heresies like the one that is being carried on by the Jesuits within the Catholic Church.
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:38.000]  Just because there's mafia in charge of all the major groups doesn't mean the groups are bad.
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  Absolutely.
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:44.000]  And Maxwell and Epstein were Sabati and Frankis.
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  That's right.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  Part of that cult under her father's control.
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:52.000]  We'll be right back on the side to finish up for you.
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:24.000]  We'll be right back.
[2:29:48.000 --> 2:29:54.000]  Protect your wireless home network today with flash routers.
[2:29:54.000 --> 2:29:56.000]  Knock on wood.
[2:29:56.000 --> 2:29:59.000]  I am not tempting fate.
[2:29:59.000 --> 2:30:04.000]  But everybody around the office, especially folks that have worked there a long time,
[2:30:04.000 --> 2:30:07.000]  have noticed that I really don't ever get sick.
[2:30:07.000 --> 2:30:11.000]  Now, again, I might get sick tomorrow because I just made that statement.
[2:30:11.000 --> 2:30:12.000]  I'm not tempting fate.
[2:30:12.000 --> 2:30:15.000]  I'll say that again because I am superstitious when it comes down to that.
[2:30:15.000 --> 2:30:19.000]  I'm very thankful for the good Lord, for the Constitution I've been given.
[2:30:19.000 --> 2:30:26.000]  But up until about eight, nine years ago when I started taking X2 and the products in Forrest Life,
[2:30:26.000 --> 2:30:29.000]  I still got sick every couple of years.
[2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:33.000]  And I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that.
[2:30:33.000 --> 2:30:39.000]  But now that I religiously take the products in Forrest Life, one of the highest quality stuff
[2:30:39.000 --> 2:30:45.000]  you're going to find out there, I just never get a fever anymore.
[2:30:45.000 --> 2:30:50.000]  It's probably been three, four years since I've had a fever.
[2:30:50.000 --> 2:30:51.000]  It's just crazy.
[2:30:51.000 --> 2:31:20.000]  So I chalk it up to genetics and the great products.
[2:31:22.000 --> 2:31:23.000]  And so it's very simple.
[2:31:23.000 --> 2:31:27.000]  If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy,
[2:31:27.000 --> 2:31:30.000]  which God wants to see, you see, we have to make the effort.
[2:31:30.000 --> 2:31:33.000]  110% God will finish the move.
[2:31:33.000 --> 2:31:37.000]  And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack.
[2:31:37.000 --> 2:31:38.000]  I want to attack.
[2:31:38.000 --> 2:31:41.000]  I want to go after the globalists and just believe me, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:31:41.000 --> 2:31:44.000]  that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together,
[2:31:44.000 --> 2:31:46.000]  you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[2:31:46.000 --> 2:31:50.000]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family.
[2:31:50.000 --> 2:31:51.000]  For your family.
[2:31:51.000 --> 2:32:20.000]  Because we're in this together, infowarstore.com.
[2:32:21.000 --> 2:32:24.000]  I'm committed to a future for humanity.
[2:32:24.000 --> 2:32:26.000]  And I know you are as well.
[2:32:26.000 --> 2:32:30.000]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the infowar.
[2:32:30.000 --> 2:32:34.000]  And I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020, however you can.
[2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:38.000]  For bottom my heart, for my family, and from the great crew at InfoWars,
[2:32:38.000 --> 2:32:41.000]  I want to thank you all because you are the InfoWars.
[2:32:41.000 --> 2:32:42.000]  And you know that's not just words.
[2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:44.000]  That's reality.
[2:32:44.000 --> 2:32:45.000]  You have made history.
[2:32:45.000 --> 2:32:47.000]  We have made history together.
[2:32:47.000 --> 2:32:52.000]  InfoWars.com only has power because of you.
[2:32:52.000 --> 2:33:18.000]  And I suggest you use it.
[2:33:18.000 --> 2:33:39.000]  All right, Leo Zidami is going to be in studio with us soon.
[2:33:39.000 --> 2:33:41.000]  You might even fly out here with Roseanne Barr.
[2:33:41.000 --> 2:33:45.000]  She's been wanting to get on the show and have me on her show forever, but it just never happens.
[2:33:45.000 --> 2:33:48.000]  And again, it's not bragging.
[2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:50.000]  It's pointing out that Liberty's popular.
[2:33:50.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  Joe Rogan's number one podcast ever is my interview last year.
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:33:58.000]  His third largest is my interview the year before.
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:03.000]  And I talked to Joe sometimes and he's like, oh, we'll see about it sometime.
[2:34:03.000 --> 2:34:05.000]  I'm just like, whatever, man.
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:07.000]  It's like you win the ND 500.
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  And they go, you can't be on the rest track again.
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:11.000]  You're just not allowed to.
[2:34:11.000 --> 2:34:14.000]  And they're only showing one feed of the show.
[2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:16.000]  You add up all the videos on his channel.
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:20.000]  The last time I was on on YouTube, it's like 35 million views.
[2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:21.000]  You count the other platforms.
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:25.000]  It's like 60 million views of a long form podcast.
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  And there's news articles about it.
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:33.000]  But I was the most popular, also voted the most popular, but also voted the most disliked by liberals.
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:40.000]  So I mean, I have the best positive numbers, best negative numbers, which again shows freedom is popular.
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:42.000]  And so thanks for keeping me in the game listeners.
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:45.000]  That's why we have info wars and banned on video.
[2:34:45.000 --> 2:34:48.000]  The Sentinel, the place they're not supposed to get it, spread the word.
[2:34:48.000 --> 2:34:53.000]  That's how we cause this exponential operation that the globalist can't stand.
[2:34:53.000 --> 2:34:55.000]  Hey, here's the forbidden info here.
[2:34:55.000 --> 2:34:58.000]  You're not supposed to hear Leo getting back to this new year.
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:01.000]  We're now into just in closing.
[2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:04.000]  Obviously, they're trying to foment civil war.
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:06.000]  Obviously, they're trying to foment racial strife.
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:07.000]  They admit they're doing that.
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:11.000]  They're trying to start gun confiscation of Democrat controlled states.
[2:35:11.000 --> 2:35:14.000]  We're going to have people covering this this month in Virginia.
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:17.000]  How else do you think they're going to go after Trump?
[2:35:17.000 --> 2:35:19.000]  They're keeping the impeachment open.
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:23.000]  How outrageous is that holding on to the indictments saying they're going to have more?
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:25.000]  I mean, this is crazy.
[2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:34.000]  It's crazy and it's going to manifest faster than you can imagine because this Armageddon is going to finally manifest on
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  mankind one way or another. I mean, we are definitely in a turning point for humanity.
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:50.000]  And the impeachment farce can either be dismissed or either could bring to a civil war.
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:51.000]  So we pray.
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:53.000]  I repeat, we pray that it doesn't go that way.
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:36:01.000]  I hope that these stupid Democrats realize that following the Jesuit orders and attacking
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  and continuing to track Trump all the time is not the right thing to do.
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:08.000]  But as I said, this is 2020.
[2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:15.000]  And it's typical of these two numbers coming together, the confrontation between good and evil.
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:24.000]  And we're going to see many other things happening because the Antichrist will manifest also showing some wonders.
[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:28.000]  And I can tell you that Netflix is the propaganda of the beast.
[2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:35.000]  We have seen it with Gay Jesus. That was their first, the last thing in 2019.
[2:36:35.000 --> 2:36:46.000]  And now they have for 2020 a new series called Mashaia in which they are unveiling some kind of Mashaia that will manifest in the Middle East.
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:54.000]  So they are really fomenting the young people towards a direction that we definitely think is demonic.
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:55.000]  That's right.
[2:36:55.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  Everything they do is though the Maudis coming to lead the Islam to crush the West, Christianity is under attack.
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:08.000]  I mean, this is really a sabotage of humanity is what the Bible tells the Satan does.
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  I mean, we shouldn't be surprised about it.
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:14.000]  I mean, Obama joined the Netflix team.
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:22.000]  So it's all part of a propaganda game that of course is manifesting in front of a rise every day.
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  We shouldn't be surprised.
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:34.000]  But when we see that the pope is actually truly evil and is manifesting it in front of a rise and then we see Madonna,
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  that this year finally leaves the United States and goes to Portugal because, you know,
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  she is continuously attacking Trump and she hates the and she wants to confiscate all our guns.
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:52.000]  We see that these people in Hollywood are losing touch with reality and so maybe in 2020,
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:57.000]  the new trend will be to instead embrace Alex Jones in four words,
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  what we are doing at theleadsagami.com and embracing a reality,
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:08.000]  which is a reality that of course is of embracing with all our heart Jesus.
[2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  That's the most important thing in this moment of history.
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:12.000]  That's right.
[2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:15.000]  And the globalists are trying to run different groups and play us off against each other.
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:17.000]  It's just all good versus evil.
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:20.000]  And we need to judge people individually, not off what group they are.
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:23.000]  But the left is all pushing that in the name of openness.
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:26.000]  They're saying it's only about what group you're in, not who you are.
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:27.000]  Extremely dangerous.
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:29.000]  All right, Leo Zagami, leozagami.com.
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:31.000]  Thank you for the time.
[2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:32.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:34.000]  Here we are together in 2020.
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  Can you believe it?
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:37.000]  Someday in 2020.
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:40.000]  And of course a fabled year of incredible change.
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:44.000]  And it's happening.
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:46.000]  Everything's crazy in 2020.
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  And we're still here on air.
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:48.000]  We weren't supposed to be here.
[2:38:48.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  The globalists were supposed to have us off the air, but thanks to you and this great crew,
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:54.000]  your prayers were still on air.
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:59.000]  Now, Jason Bartlett is a founder of Bohr Extinction.
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:02.000]  He stands for Jesus Christ and only him.
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:06.000]  And he's walking just started yesterday from Austin, Texas to D.C.
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:09.000]  to bring an end to farm murders in South Africa.
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:14.000]  Now, I can play you, the deputy president, the defense minister, all the clips are very sad,
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:16.000]  saying we're going to kill all the white farmers.
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:21.000]  It's exploded, just like it happened in Rhodesia and Zimbabwe and, you know,
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:24.000]  all those other countries' names are always changing.
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:27.000]  And it's just out of control.
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:28.000]  This is the communism.
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:32.000]  And the left is supporting this very, very sad, but it's all part of the New York Times
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:35.000]  saying whites are inherently bad, need to be gotten rid of.
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:37.000]  It's not okay to be white.
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:40.000]  This is what the left is doing in their divide and conquer.
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:46.000]  So Jason Bartlett joins us to talk about what it's really like in South Africa.
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:50.000]  And now the government's seeking to take the final guns out of white folks' hands
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:53.000]  and then like the other African countries, as soon as the farmers are gone,
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:56.000]  everything falls apart and people start starving to death.
[2:39:56.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  And we know that's already starting to happen.
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:02.000]  So Jason Bartlett, thank you for joining us.
[2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:06.000]  And tell us why you're doing this and what your mission is.
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:08.000]  Hi, Alex, man. It's great to meet you.
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:12.000]  And yes, my mission is it's already on foot.
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:16.000]  I've actually stopped you at a beautiful little church in Texas that gave me a Wi-Fi password
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:18.000]  because the TNT doesn't work out yet.
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:21.000]  But, you know, I'm walking from Austin, Texas to the White House
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:23.000]  for the persecution of Christian farmers in South Africa.
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:25.000]  They've been brutally tortured and murdered.
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:31.000]  And the leftists are working with people like Antifa and they're attacking me now.
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:32.000]  They're coming after me.
[2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:37.000]  And it's just incredible how our enemies are exactly the same because they stand for the same thing.
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  They want to divide us. They want to dehumanize us.
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:42.000]  And I mean, unfortunately, my cousin was even shot in the back of their head.
[2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:44.000]  People get raped. People get tortured.
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  They cut their eyes out. They cut their genitals off.
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  It's just horrific what they're doing over there.
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:51.000]  And they do it on a daily basis, Alex.
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:53.000]  And this has been going on for a long time.
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  But now it's the government ministers officially saying it's massive.
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:40:58.000]  And now the news is defending.
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:01.000]  So a few years ago, they said white genocide wasn't happening.
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  Christian genocide wasn't happening.
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:07.000]  And the communists are also getting black tribes that aren't Christian to kill blacks that are Christian.
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  This is really a targeting of Christians, isn't it?
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  It is. It's a direct targeting of Christians.
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  And yes, we happen to be whites and sure they do kill their own black people.
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:19.000]  And I feel sorry for them, too.
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  But I'm standing up for our people because the government is standing up and singing.
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  You can look at it all over.
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:27.000]  They sing one settler, one bullet could kill the farmer.
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:30.000]  And they sing this countless, countless times.
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  And they just stand up there and they say slit the throat of whiteness.
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  And nobody condones it and nobody says anything.
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:40.000]  And they're hiding it because there's a genocide.
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  There's even people called like a busting the myth of white genocide working with Antifa.
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:47.000]  And they just then attacking me like crazy.
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:54.000]  So Americans really need to open their eyes and care about South Africa because South Africa is setting the framework for America.
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:42:02.000]  And that's why we want preferential asylum asylum cases to be approved as well as lenient visas to be approved.
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  Because we law abiding citizens and we want to come and help feed this great nation and keep it great.
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:07.000]  Well, that's another point.
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:09.000]  Whites are being run out of South Africa.
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:11.000]  The left says, don't let you out.
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:12.000]  Let you die there.
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  Don't have any white immigration to the West.
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:20.000]  But Russia is taking the South Africans that are literally hanging on helicopter skids as they escape.
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  We've had some who are staying and fighting to the death.
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:25.000]  It's just unbelievable.
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  Let's come back with Jason Bartlett and talk about how he got to the U.S.
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:30.000]  Why he's walking around the United States.
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  How to try to expose this boreextinction.org.
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:36.000]  If I'd have known he was doing this, I'd have got him in studio before he started his walk.
[2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  But I'm glad we found out about it.
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  I'm aware of what he's doing, boreextinction.org.
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:41.000]  He'll be on Twitter until they ban him.
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  Buffalo Bartlett on Twitter for now just calling for South African white farmers to not be targeted for being white exterminated.
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:55.000]  Something obviously that open Netflix and Obama absolutely love.
[2:42:55.000 --> 2:42:59.000]  A little less than four months ago, I made the announcement on air.
[2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:05.000]  I said, hey, I have a tendency to take the high quality supplements from FoursLife for a while,
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:09.000]  get great results, and then slowly I stop using them.
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:11.000]  I forget to religiously take them.
[2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:15.000]  I'm going to religiously take the supplements for the next few months.
[2:43:15.000 --> 2:43:18.000]  And I've lost almost 40 pounds now.
[2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:19.000]  Everybody can see it on air.
[2:43:19.000 --> 2:43:21.000]  My energy is off the charts.
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:23.000]  Everything is amazing.
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:27.000]  And it's because I am taking the FoursLife products, the Krill Oil.
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:29.000]  I'm taking the X2 and the X3.
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:34.000]  I'm taking the Brain Force Plus when I work out, when I have to work really late.
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:36.000]  I'm taking half a pack of Turbo Force.
[2:43:36.000 --> 2:43:38.000]  It is clean energy.
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:42.000]  It is really making my whole life so much more enjoyable.
[2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:44.000]  It's making the shows more focused.
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:45.000]  I've got more energy.
[2:43:45.000 --> 2:43:49.000]  We have huge sales going right now for the new year at infowarslife.com.
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:50.000]  A big clearance sale.

[2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:10.000]  Thank you so much.
[2:44:10.000 --> 2:44:14.000]  I don't want the globalists to win for my children's future, for your children's future.
[2:44:14.000 --> 2:44:17.000]  But also, I just personally don't want them to be able to shut us down.
[2:44:17.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  And thanks to you spreading the word and buying the products, we are able to stay on air.

[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:30.000]  The new year is here.
[2:44:30.000 --> 2:44:33.000]  It's a great way to get healthy and fund the InfoWars.
[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:38.000]  So go to infowarslife.com and stock up on all the great products like Brain Force Plus

[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:41.000]  All of it is amazing.
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:43.000]  The real Red Pill Plus, the real Red Pill.
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:47.000]  Find out about these great products at infowarslife.com and fund the InfoWars.
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:53.000]  But whatever you do, remember, 2020 is a critical year, so everybody get the word out and fight for freedom.
[2:44:55.000 --> 2:44:58.000]  It was about three and a half months ago, and I said on air,
[2:44:58.000 --> 2:45:00.000]  I'm going to religiously take my supplements.
[2:45:00.000 --> 2:45:04.000]  I'd always taken them in the past, but I forget like everybody else to stay on the regimen.
[2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:10.000]  Well, I've done it, and I've lost 39 pounds in less than four months, and my life is so amazing.
[2:45:10.000 --> 2:45:14.000]  And I still have cake and ice cream and pie, just like I did before.
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:20.000]  I'm exercising the same amount, but my body has the trace elements and the key things it needs,
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:23.000]  like the clean iodine and X2 and X3.
[2:45:23.000 --> 2:45:27.000]  And I take a good energy booster like Turbo Force and Brain Force for my brain.
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:30.000]  And I take the fish oil, and I take the turmeric, and I take the knockout,
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:34.000]  and I use the good toothpaste that's fluoride free, that's got the tea tree oil and so much more,
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:36.000]  at infowarslife.com.
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:39.000]  2020 is dawning. We have big sales, total clearance right now.
[2:45:39.000 --> 2:45:45.000]  No excuse for you to go to the store and get these great products and experience them for yourself and fund the InfoWars.
[2:45:45.000 --> 2:45:48.000]  A total 360 win going into 2020.
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:51.000]  That's why it's more important than ever to keep InfoWars on the air,
[2:45:51.000 --> 2:45:54.000]  and only you can do that by getting great products at infowarslife.com.
[2:45:54.000 --> 2:45:57.000]  I keep my eye on the news all the time,
[2:45:57.000 --> 2:46:02.000]  but I miss the fact that in late 2019, just about two weeks ago,
[2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:10.000]  the CDC and the FDA approved live Ebola vaccine
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:14.000]  to be given inside the United States, and it is an experimental vaccine.
[2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:16.000]  It is live.
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  It's not even attenuated.
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:23.000]  They've just genetically modified it, so it's supposedly not lethal.
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:29.000]  Same stuff they did with the Gardasil vaccine that's admittedly killed and maimed so many.
[2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:34.000]  This is just crazy, and the Congos have the biggest outbreaks of Ebola ever
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:38.000]  since they started giving the vaccine there in the last few years.
[2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:45.000]  Oh, and of course, opening the borders up here and letting people in unvetted the Democrats distribute across the country.
[2:46:45.000 --> 2:46:48.000]  You cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity,
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:52.000]  and it is an attempted Ebola assault on America.
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:54.000]  This is the New World Order.
[2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:51.000]  Music
[2:47:51.000 --> 2:47:54.000]  Bad to the bone.
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  Bad to the bone.
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:47:59.000]  Let me tell you something that's bad to the bone.
[2:47:59.000 --> 2:48:03.000]  You've heard callers call in and former military special operations folks saying,
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:07.000]  man, I don't know how you know your intel or how you get stuff so accurate.
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:15.000]  Well, I've been getting some calls today and some text messages from multiple people telling me the same thing.
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:20.000]  And they say the contractors, the Marines, the Army, they're all going in heavy into Iraq.
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:23.000]  Iran is, I mean, the safety's off.
[2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:29.000]  The gun's cocked to Iran's head right now after what just got pulled at the embassy.
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:33.000]  And we'll be here covering it, but it's all a huge time bomb.
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:35.000]  You know, Trump says he wants peace.
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  I understand that.
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:37.000]  I don't want war.
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:39.000]  A lot of sophisticated things going on there as well.
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  Paul Watson's host in the fourth hour.
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:43.000]  I want to give us some really big Ebola news here in a few minutes,
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:49.000]  but going back to Jason Bartlett, who I want to get updates from as he travels across the country.
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:55.000]  We, once he gets to the White House, we're going to be up in Virginia and D.C.,
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:49:01.000]  you know, middle and end of the month covering them trying to start martial law in Virginia with gun confiscation.
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:03.000]  We'll probably interview Jason there.
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:11.000]  But if we played you all the clips of the South African president, the defense minister,
[2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:17.000]  I mean, it's what he's saying, you know, one farmer, one bullet, all this stuff, that's what's going on.
[2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:21.000]  And the media then tries to cover it up or they go, oh, they deserve it. They're white.
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:22.000]  This is so evil.
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:29.000]  So what's the difference, though, explaining what's already happened in other African countries to the white population
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:32.000]  and what happens once they've all been killed or run out
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:38.000]  and how some of the other countries have been different versus South Africa?
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:42.000]  You know, if you take a look at a place called Rhodesia Zimbabwe,
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:44.000]  a lot of my family members are actually from Zimbabwe.
[2:49:44.000 --> 2:49:47.000]  So this is not the first country we've been run out of, by the way.
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:50.000]  And it used to be known as the bread basket of Africa.
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:54.000]  And now the people are suffering from a complete famine.
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:49:59.000]  I mean, the people are starving and you don't see these leftists and the Democrats in there trying to help out there.
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:02.000]  They don't help at all. You know, they basically starving.
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  But that's exactly what's going to happen to South Africa because they just want to take the land.
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:11.000]  In 2018, they changed the constitution to just take white people's land,
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:14.000]  not anybody's land, white people's land specifically.
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:17.000]  And they just, in order to take it, they're just going to say,
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:22.000]  OK, we're going to come, no matter what debt you've got, you've got to pay the debt and we take in the land.
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:27.000]  And that's why they tend to rape the men and kill them and then rape the woman
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:32.000]  and leave the woman and children raped and alive so that they are intimidated to sell their farms.
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:36.000]  And that's why I say to anybody that tries to say that this is a myth,
[2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  I ask them and I beg them and I challenge them.
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:44.000]  No, it is a myth. It's impossible for anybody in Africa to be violent to white people.
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  OK, don't lie. No, no, listen, we know it's not a myth.
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:54.000]  I mean, the left says that black on white crime is a myth even though it's 10 to 1 the other way.
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:57.000]  We get it. So what needs to come out of this? Where do you see this going?
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:51:02.000]  I've had some of the groups on the Christian groups from South Africa, they say they're staying.
[2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:05.000]  You know, you've got those civil defense groups and things.
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:10.000]  Are you saying South Africa is just lost to communists and there's no way for the Africans to wake up
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:17.000]  and be Christian and realize that they don't want the tiny minority of white farmers to leave?
[2:51:17.000 --> 2:51:22.000]  Well, we first of all, we need a bold president like Donald Trump that says, hey, listen,
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:25.000]  I'm not ashamed to be a Christian and I'm going to help out.
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:28.000]  And I don't think there's a political way to fix South Africa.
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:32.000]  No, because they don't want it fixed and they're disguising it as this rainbow nation.
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:36.000]  It's actually a rape nation because every three minutes someone is raped.
[2:51:36.000 --> 2:51:41.000]  Men and women and children under 24, 24 months old, you know, that's their culture.
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:47.000]  And you know, the people believe you get magical powers when you rape a baby or it heals you.
[2:51:47.000 --> 2:51:48.000]  Explain that.
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:54.000]  Yes. So when when a baby is 24 months old and younger, they believe not everybody,
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:51:56.000]  but countless, countless people.
[2:51:56.000 --> 2:52:03.000]  24 months and younger baby. Yeah. If you rape a 24 month old baby and younger,
[2:52:03.000 --> 2:52:06.000]  you're relieved of all your sins and your inequities.
[2:52:06.000 --> 2:52:09.000]  That's what they believe. And it's 2020.
[2:52:09.000 --> 2:52:12.000]  You know, so you understand the people that we're dealing with.
[2:52:12.000 --> 2:52:15.000]  We're not dealing with God fearing loving people.
[2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:17.000]  You're dealing with witch doctors.
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:19.000]  You're dealing with people that boil children alive.
[2:52:19.000 --> 2:52:24.000]  You know that there was a child, a 12 year old boiled alive in the bath.
[2:52:24.000 --> 2:52:28.000]  Now try work that out. Try fathom that what has to go through that.
[2:52:28.000 --> 2:52:30.000]  People have to go. Who walks around?
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:33.000]  They enjoy it. I mean, I mean, this is loving to take a child.
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:38.000]  You take their power by taking 30 minutes to boil him alive.
[2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:40.000]  Yes. I mean, no, not 30 minutes. Work it out.
[2:52:40.000 --> 2:52:41.000]  How deep is a bath, right?
[2:52:41.000 --> 2:52:47.000]  You go, you have to walk between a stove up and down and hear someone screaming for more than an hour or two hours.
[2:52:47.000 --> 2:52:52.000]  While you've raped his mother, you've raped his little sister of a month or two.
[2:52:52.000 --> 2:52:55.000]  And you stick them in the boiling water for the extra enjoyment.
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:52:59.000]  Exactly. And then you know what they do like they did with my cousin.
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:04.000]  He was busy barbecuing and they shot him in the back of their head, strangled him and then burnt him with a grill.
[2:53:04.000 --> 2:53:11.000]  And then he's, my other cousin said to me, they sat around him and they ate the stuff he was barbecuing in front of him.
[2:53:11.000 --> 2:53:14.000]  Wow, there's blood and guts. I mean, just blood lying all over the floor.
[2:53:14.000 --> 2:53:16.000]  It's just horrendous what they're doing.
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:21.000]  And the president goes and says to Donald Trump alive on TV and he denies everything.
[2:53:21.000 --> 2:53:26.000]  He says, no, there's no killings of white people. We are clearly misinformed.
[2:53:26.000 --> 2:53:31.000]  And that's why America needs to really just come up because this is sitting on your doorstep.
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:34.000]  Go look on your doorstep at home. That is coming for you.
[2:53:34.000 --> 2:53:37.000]  That's what the UN and the left are trying to organize.
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:42.000]  The international left funded and created what's now happening in South Africa. They love it.
[2:53:42.000 --> 2:53:48.000]  Oh, but nobody criticizes the communist Chinese that are taking over Africa. Tell us about that.
[2:53:48.000 --> 2:53:54.000]  Oh, wow. Yeah, man. And then you see that. But like when I've been traveling Africa my whole life and all of it,
[2:53:54.000 --> 2:53:59.000]  you never used to see that all the small little tuck shops and businesses used to be black owners.
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:03.000]  They hardly any more black owners. It's now Chinese people and they don't employ anybody.
[2:54:03.000 --> 2:54:08.000]  They only employ the Chinese. They don't employ the black people because they hate the black people.
[2:54:08.000 --> 2:54:12.000]  Explain that. There's not Christianity going on with the chai comms.
[2:54:12.000 --> 2:54:15.000]  Explain what they're doing. I mean, it's all admitted. They're totally exploiting Africa.
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:18.000]  But the left loves it because only whites are bad.
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:22.000]  So if a non-white's hurting another non-white, it doesn't exist.
[2:54:22.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  No, they just say it doesn't exist. And that's why I say if you continue to look,
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  you can go onto my Twitter feed and you can see the real life voices of what these people are doing.
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:34.000]  And look at the photos that you are showing and stuff like that.
[2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:37.000]  They're dealing and they're busy selling themselves out because they think, you know,
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:40.000]  because they poach rhino together and they walk together.
[2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:43.000]  And that's another little fact. You know, nobody talks about the rhino anymore
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  because the white farmer is the only protecting the rhino.
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:50.000]  The government doesn't care. They make money off the rhino horns.
[2:54:50.000 --> 2:54:53.000]  You know, so they're working hand in hand and they are communist country.
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:57.000]  And it's just evil what's going on there. And where can we go?
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:55:01.000]  They keep on telling us to leave, but the criminals don't want us to leave
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:03.000]  because we're the only people paying tax.
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:07.000]  So the people are getting harassed at the airports when they finally get to be able to go
[2:55:07.000 --> 2:55:11.000]  move to Australia or New Zealand or wherever they can run to.
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:14.000]  And you remember the cornerstone of Africa is South Africa.
[2:55:14.000 --> 2:55:19.000]  So when, so at the moment, I'm actually the only person standing up for black people in Africa too.
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:21.000]  I'm like their biggest advocate.
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:24.000]  Well, I mean, we're out of time.
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:27.000]  If South Africa falls, then, yeah.
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:30.000]  Send us a bunch of links. And when you get, I know when you stay in a hotel or something,
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:34.000]  it's not bad. You're on the road, but pick a day next week when you're going to be at a hotel.
[2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  Send us a bunch of links.
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:38.000]  We'll do a whole hour on this and show everybody what you're talking about.
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:44.000]  TV viewers have already seen a lot of it, but I'd like to play audio and stuff so people can actually hear this for themselves.
[2:55:44.000 --> 2:55:46.000]  We'll actually show some necklacing, some murders.
[2:55:46.000 --> 2:55:51.000]  We'll actually have parental discretion will be advised.
[2:55:51.000 --> 2:55:55.000]  We're going to go ahead and just show people being tortured and murdered for being white on TV for everybody here.
[2:55:55.000 --> 2:55:57.000]  And then the news saying it's a good thing.
[2:55:57.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  And then Antifa saying it's a good thing here in America.
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:05.000]  So we'll talk to you, Jason Bartlett again on your March 2 DC. God bless.
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:08.000]  Thank you. God bless you too, my friend.
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:12.000]  Yeah, folks, I don't care if you're black, white, who you are, you don't deserve to be murdered for what color you are.
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:14.000]  And it's very, very dangerous.
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:17.000]  And civilization is disappearing in Africa.
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  The globalist destroyed Libya that was helping Africa.
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  Now they've totally destroyed South Africa to make the continent just absolutely collapse so the chai comms can come in and absorb it.
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:31.000]  And as a Christian, white to run out of Africa, it is falling apart.
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:36.000]  And that's just a fact very, very sad. Where Christians comes, there is civilization where we leave.
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:38.000]  There is death and destruction.
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:40.000]  And that's that's just a fact.
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:45.000]  All right, I'm going to do five minutes for Paul Watson takes over on this Ebola news.
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:48.000]  And it's big first five minutes the next hour.
[2:56:48.000 --> 2:56:51.000]  Some stations don't carry it, but we'll post it in fours.com later.
[2:56:51.000 --> 2:56:54.000]  Paul Watson from London, England.
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:56.000]  Got a ton of big topics he's going to be covering.
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:56:58.000]  Please don't forget in this hour.
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:01.000]  We have the biggest specials in our history that are about to end four days left.
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:07.000]  The end of your specials crossover to about Monday, maximum 50 to 75% off.
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:10.000]  Storewide free shipping double Patriot points got to sell out of all of this.
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:12.000]  So we don't have extra inventory.
[2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:15.000]  A lot of stuff's already selling out or sold out new stuff's coming in.
[2:57:15.000 --> 2:57:17.000]  But some of the products will come in for two, three months.
[2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:23.000]  So infowarstore.com and sign up for auto ship an additional 10% off.
[2:57:23.000 --> 2:57:28.000]  Again, infowarstore.com or triple a two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:31.000]  And you see all the attacks on info wars in the press.
[2:57:31.000 --> 2:57:35.000]  Massive demonization on the crawls on Fox News with lies about us.
[2:57:35.000 --> 2:57:39.000]  The deep state fears us because we have the spirit of Americana that can defeat them.
[2:57:39.000 --> 2:57:40.000]  They'll be back with the fourth hour.
[2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:44.000]  Paul Joseph Watson and more straight ahead.
[2:57:44.000 --> 2:57:48.000]  Info wars has delivered.
[2:57:48.000 --> 2:57:57.000]  Info wars has come through time and time and time and time again at that critical game changing moment.
[2:57:57.000 --> 2:58:00.000]  We have come through.
[2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:10.000]  And that means myself, the other hosts, the journalists, the researchers, the writers, the crew, down to the janitor, down to the bookkeeper.
[2:58:10.000 --> 2:58:12.000]  There is no top, there is no bottom.
[2:58:12.000 --> 2:58:17.000]  We are a family in this fight, ladies and gentlemen, and the stakes have never been higher.
[2:58:17.000 --> 2:58:19.000]  That's what the globalists want to take us out of the game.
[2:58:19.000 --> 2:58:23.000]  Only you keep info wars in the game.
[2:58:23.000 --> 2:58:25.000]  You are the info war.

[2:58:56.000 --> 2:58:57.000]  2020.

[3:00:05.000 --> 3:00:13.000]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide on the second live Alex Jones transmission of 2020.
[3:00:13.000 --> 3:00:17.000]  I just talked to Paul Watson who takes over and T minus five minutes is what are you covering.
[3:00:17.000 --> 3:00:27.000]  He said the societal breakdown in mayhem that happened on New Year's Eve across Europe, the ongoing Islamic invasion and so much more.
[3:00:27.000 --> 3:00:35.000]  And then of course we've got the war room with our employer coming up three to six p.m. central standard time today.
[3:00:35.000 --> 3:00:40.000]  Okay, let me hit this and I'm going to shoot a special report on this today.
[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:41.000]  We'll be airing tomorrow.
[3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:46.000]  I've already got one special report out on this, but this is a big, big deal.
[3:00:46.000 --> 3:00:55.000]  Ebola is a virus that kills 90% of people roughly that come in contact with it.
[3:00:55.000 --> 3:01:01.000]  And you've got the Congo that's had the biggest outbreak of Ebola ever last year going into this year.
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:10.000]  And you've got a pipeline by the UN and UNICEF of bringing people into Guatemala and Mexico who have not been tested in any way for Ebola.
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:14.000]  And we've had cases of Ebola show up in the Caribbean last year.
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:16.000]  You've got Africans being brought in.
[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:20.000]  We've shown you this footage last year with no vetting.
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:24.000]  Pass border patrol by the thousands and dumped out in San Antonio from the Congo as well.
[3:01:24.000 --> 3:01:29.000]  Some of them are dying in Texas and other states.
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:30.000]  And I have those articles.
[3:01:30.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  Can I get an overhead shot?
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:32.000]  Thanks.
[3:01:32.000 --> 3:01:37.000]  Now this right here, Ebola vaccine approved by FDA.
[3:01:37.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  This just happened two weeks ago.
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:50.000]  And what's incredible about this is it's a live Ebola vaccine, but they claim it's genetically modified.
[3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:51.000]  So it won't hurt you.
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:55.000]  It's just like my grandma got polio from the live polio vaccine.
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:01:56.000]  That's inside the US.
[3:01:56.000 --> 3:01:58.000]  This is now going on.
[3:01:58.000 --> 3:02:07.000]  First FDA approved vaccine for the prevention of Ebola virus disease, making a critical milestone in public health preparedness.
[3:02:07.000 --> 3:02:13.000]  Congenies woman 41 dies after entering US border custody of kidney failure.
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:17.000]  Of course, that's she had a previous medical condition.
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:21.000]  She was vomiting and in pain, kidney failure.
[3:02:21.000 --> 3:02:24.000]  That's what they call it when you got Ebola folks in the Caribbean.
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:26.000]  They said, oh, no, people trying to get to the US haven't.
[3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:29.000]  I was in the news a month ago, but it gets shut down.
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:30.000]  That's the wash from post.
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:34.000]  Ebola survivors face kidney problems and risk of premature death.
[3:02:34.000 --> 3:02:39.000]  Reuters see, but they're covering it all up.
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:43.000]  It can linger in men's semen for more than two years.
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:46.000]  They don't get it, but you do.
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:48.000]  That's from the CDC.
[3:02:48.000 --> 3:02:51.000]  So imagine the Democrats are bringing folks in from the Congo.
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:02:52.000]  No testing.
[3:02:52.000 --> 3:02:58.000]  Got all the video of this last year in our reports, exclusive illegals from Ebola stretch in Congo sent across US.
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  Liberals came over and assaulted Gregory's saying, don't you videotape this.
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:12.000]  The Africans are pouring in, not even being tested, overriding the Mexican troops.
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:14.000]  This is total insanity.
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  And when there are Ebola outbreaks, it gets covered up.
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:18.000]  We know they've happened.
[3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:21.000]  They get shipped off to the Center for Disease Control at Atlanta.
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:24.000]  This is how those zombie movies always start.
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:29.000]  But oh, you've got to take all the vaccines or you're causing measles, mumps, and rebellives.
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:31.000]  Somebody else has had all these shots.
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:33.000]  Well, then why aren't they protected?
[3:03:33.000 --> 3:03:36.000]  It turns out they haven't eradicated these diseases.
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:38.000]  Folks, they haven't eradicated things like polio.
[3:03:38.000 --> 3:03:43.000]  They just call it polio like illnesses, but it's polio.
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:48.000]  And it turns out the measles outbreaks and other things are happening with vaccinated people.
[3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:50.000]  They're getting it from that.
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:51.000]  And the insert says it can do it.
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:53.000]  They're spreading it.
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:58.000]  It's hygiene and running water that has made all this go way down.
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:00.000]  By the fifties, they sort of pushed all the vaccines.
[3:04:00.000 --> 3:04:05.000]  Actual diseases went up at that point because it lowers your immunity when you take vaccines.
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:06.000]  Do they work sometimes?
[3:04:06.000 --> 3:04:07.000]  Yes.
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  Are they all tainted?
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:09.000]  Yes.
[3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:12.000]  Is there vaccine damage funds that cover it up secretly?
[3:04:12.000 --> 3:04:13.000]  Yes.
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:14.000]  Look it up.
[3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:17.000]  It's all public that it's secret.
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:22.000]  They admit they're covering it up and then telling you arrest people that question it.
[3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:26.000]  The same big farmer that brings us all these other deadly drugs and it's always getting caught in evil things.
[3:04:26.000 --> 3:04:30.000]  I'm supposed to trust you putting genetically engineered Ebola into me.
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:38.000]  And now some are saying, oh, we want to make everybody take Gardasil shots and make everybody take Ebola shots over my dead body.
[3:04:38.000 --> 3:04:43.000]  So, live Ebola to be injected into Americans, there's your headline.
[3:04:43.000 --> 3:04:47.000]  CDC announces plan to inject Americans with live Ebola virus.
[3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:48.000]  There's your headline.
[3:04:48.000 --> 3:04:50.000]  Paul Joseph Watson takes over in 60 seconds.
[3:04:50.000 --> 3:04:55.000]  Please spread the live links.
[3:04:55.000 --> 3:05:05.000]  As I drive in to the Central Texas Information Warfare Command Center in Austin, Texas, it is January 2nd, 2020.
[3:05:05.000 --> 3:05:14.000]  We only have four days left as of me taping this to take advantage of the biggest sales in the history of the fours,
[3:05:14.000 --> 3:05:24.000]  which we've escalated in the last year to sell out of all of our inventory to fund ourselves into 2020 and to be able to avoid inventory taxes.
[3:05:24.000 --> 3:05:30.000]  We are selling out of almost everything right now or have already sold out many of our best selling items.
[3:05:30.000 --> 3:05:36.000]  We have store-wide free shipping. We have double day free of points and up to 75% off.

[3:06:05.000 --> 3:06:06.000]  And we're live.
[3:06:06.000 --> 3:06:14.000]  It is my first show of 2020 here in the fourth hour and we're going to get into New Year's Eve mayhem across Europe.
[3:06:14.000 --> 3:06:20.000]  Of course, in Belgium, in France, in Holland, again, on New Year's Eve.
[3:06:20.000 --> 3:06:29.000]  We saw a bunch of New Year's Eve mayhem in terms of fireworks being thrown at people, cars being set on fire.
[3:06:29.000 --> 3:06:34.000]  And this is something that we've seen basically the imposition of space.
[3:06:34.000 --> 3:06:40.000]  If you go to certain areas, certain no-go zones, which the media says don't exist and are a conspiracy theory,
[3:06:40.000 --> 3:06:47.000]  even though if you do go there, you will literally get attacked and have to be escorted out by police in some instances.
[3:06:47.000 --> 3:06:54.000]  This phenomenon really started building up probably as recently as 2013-2014.
[3:06:54.000 --> 3:06:57.000]  I noticed that it started to become a bigger problem.
[3:06:57.000 --> 3:06:59.000]  Now it's an annual event.
[3:06:59.000 --> 3:07:01.000]  Of course, I guess it could be worse.
[3:07:01.000 --> 3:07:07.000]  I guess we could have hundreds of men molesting 2,000 women on New Year's Eve,
[3:07:07.000 --> 3:07:11.000]  which is what happened on New Year's Eve in Cologne 2015.
[3:07:11.000 --> 3:07:16.000]  The vast majority of them, of course, being migrants from North Africa and the Middle East.
[3:07:16.000 --> 3:07:22.000]  So this is a phenomenon that we've come to see as quite normal over the past few years
[3:07:22.000 --> 3:07:28.000]  since our friends coming out across from other continents have vastly increased in numbers.
[3:07:28.000 --> 3:07:30.000]  And now we have it happening once again this year.
[3:07:30.000 --> 3:07:37.000]  This is out of Info Wars Europe, Dan Lyman, Mayhem in Brussels as cars torched over 200 arrested.
[3:07:37.000 --> 3:07:41.000]  New Year's Eve was chaotic in Belgium's capital city with police making over 200 arrests.
[3:07:41.000 --> 3:07:45.000]  I mean widespread fires and property destruction.
[3:07:45.000 --> 3:07:51.000]  Now, I used to talk about this when it first really started coming to public attention
[3:07:51.000 --> 3:07:56.000]  with the rise of social media around 2014-2015,
[3:07:56.000 --> 3:08:02.000]  pointing out that these people were, in some cases, literally throwing fireworks at women with prams.
[3:08:02.000 --> 3:08:07.000]  And the response from some people on the left on Twitter and other social media platforms was,
[3:08:07.000 --> 3:08:11.000]  oh, are you afraid of fireworks?
[3:08:11.000 --> 3:08:16.000]  Well, yes, I would be afraid of a firework if somebody was throwing it in my face,
[3:08:16.000 --> 3:08:20.000]  which could blind you, which could horribly disfigure you.
[3:08:20.000 --> 3:08:22.000]  It's like saying, oh, are you afraid of being acid attacked?
[3:08:22.000 --> 3:08:27.000]  Yes, that's literally what they said, like, oh, you're a coward.
[3:08:27.000 --> 3:08:28.000]  You're afraid of fireworks.
[3:08:28.000 --> 3:08:34.000]  Yes, if somebody, if a gang of men are throwing fireworks at a mother with a baby in a pram,
[3:08:34.000 --> 3:08:37.000]  yes, that's something we should be concerned about.
[3:08:37.000 --> 3:08:38.000]  Why is this happening?
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:41.000]  Because it's again, it's the imposition of space.
[3:08:41.000 --> 3:08:48.000]  You see this in very Islamic areas of London, places like Night's Bridge, Marble Arch,
[3:08:48.000 --> 3:08:53.000]  where literally now one in every three shop has Islamic lettering above it.
[3:08:53.000 --> 3:08:58.000]  That's not an exaggeration, go to Marble Arch, London, you'll see that for yourself.
[3:08:58.000 --> 3:09:02.000]  And what the culture is, it's a cafe culture, you could call it that,
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:07.000]  but it's not really like the cafe culture that they used to have in places like Paris.
[3:09:07.000 --> 3:09:12.000]  The culture is groups of migrant men, mainly from the Middle East,
[3:09:12.000 --> 3:09:18.000]  will monopolize these public spaces, monopolize these cafes, diners, restaurants,
[3:09:18.000 --> 3:09:25.000]  stand outside, not just on the, not just outside the restaurant or the bar or the cafe,
[3:09:25.000 --> 3:09:30.000]  they'll stand in the middle of the pavement, huge groups of men.
[3:09:30.000 --> 3:09:36.000]  So not just women walking on their own, but anyone who doesn't want to be intimidated is not going to cross over
[3:09:36.000 --> 3:09:37.000]  and walk down that sidewalk.
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:42.000]  And then when you get more and more of those, when one in every three shops is Islamic,
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:44.000]  that is an occupation of space.
[3:09:44.000 --> 3:09:46.000]  It is, in essence, an occupation.
[3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:52.000]  And this is the same phenomenon we see with these fireworks in cities like Brussels,
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:55.000]  in cities like Berlin and Cologne.
[3:09:55.000 --> 3:09:59.000]  Of course, what most people don't remember is that attendant to the rapes,
[3:09:59.000 --> 3:10:06.000]  the sexual molestations in Cologne, which even police in one instance described as it being like a war zone.
[3:10:06.000 --> 3:10:13.000]  And this is basically a riot situation that you're seeing when you've got police in riot gear having to respond to this.
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:17.000]  Of course, a couple of years ago in, I think it was in Berlin,
[3:10:17.000 --> 3:10:20.000]  we saw people literally with pistols just firing them in the air.
[3:10:20.000 --> 3:10:27.000]  If anyone else did that, they'd be arrested and thrown in jail for a great number of years here in Europe
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:29.000]  where nobody's allowed to have guns really.
[3:10:29.000 --> 3:10:33.000]  But they get to do it and it's part of their celebration and it's part of their culture and nothing happens
[3:10:33.000 --> 3:10:36.000]  and everybody just accepts it.
[3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:41.000]  Preliminary reports indicate at least 211 people were arrested during the night,
[3:10:41.000 --> 3:10:45.000]  the offences ranging from arson to shooting projectiles to vandalism.
[3:10:45.000 --> 3:10:50.000]  So I guess at least in Brussels, they arrested people, mainly they don't arrest anybody.
[3:10:50.000 --> 3:10:55.000]  At least 21 cars and a scooter were either set light or damaged by nearby blazers
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:11:00.000]  and fire response teams mitigated roughly 75 burning trash cans.
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:04.000]  So it's not just the fireworks. I'd like to set the cars on fire.
[3:11:04.000 --> 3:11:12.000]  Of course, that was one of the main methods of rioting and civil unrest in Paris back in 2005 during those riots
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:18.000]  where the car fire was seen as the symbol of that, again, mainly in migrant suburbs in the banlieu.
[3:11:18.000 --> 3:11:24.000]  And we've seen that in places like Stockholm and Rinkeby Malmo in Sweden as well.
[3:11:24.000 --> 3:11:26.000]  We have this out of Breitbart.
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:30.000]  Once hundreds of cars touched and police attacked over new years,
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:33.000]  hundreds of cars were set on fire across French cities on New Year's Eve,
[3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:37.000]  with some cities seeing an even larger number of cars burned than the previous year.
[3:11:37.000 --> 3:11:42.000]  The total of 100,000 police were deployed in Paris.
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:48.000]  With one source claiming the level of violence on the night was relatively calm compared to previous years.
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:51.000]  So that was a calm New Year's Eve for Paris.
[3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:54.000]  100,000 police deployed.
[3:11:54.000 --> 3:11:57.000]  The violence was allegedly less than previous years.
[3:11:57.000 --> 3:12:00.000]  But again, they had hundreds of car fires.
[3:12:00.000 --> 3:12:06.000]  And then I've seen videos out of Strasbourg today, which look even worse.
[3:12:06.000 --> 3:12:10.000]  And in fact, they're literally attacking schools in one instance.
[3:12:10.000 --> 3:12:12.000]  In fact, it was out of Germany.
[3:12:12.000 --> 3:12:18.000]  This is out of Searchlight Germany, which is a German news source, but the articles translated.
[3:12:18.000 --> 3:12:24.000]  High school set on fire in Germany by culprit shouting a lot.
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:29.000]  A gang of young men, young men, that's always how they describe them.
[3:12:29.000 --> 3:12:32.000]  Oh, it's just a gang of youths, just a gang of young men.
[3:12:32.000 --> 3:12:34.000]  Yeah, certain demographic.
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:36.000]  Always a certain demographic, isn't it?
[3:12:36.000 --> 3:12:41.000]  According to the video, predominantly migrants from Turkish or Arabic cultures.
[3:12:41.000 --> 3:12:45.000]  But again, in the mainstream news article, it's just young men.
[3:12:45.000 --> 3:12:51.000]  But smashed the windows of the Albert Schweitzer High School in Wolfsburg's West Hagen district
[3:12:51.000 --> 3:12:56.000]  and ignited fireworks in the classrooms, triggering the fire alarm.
[3:12:56.000 --> 3:13:01.000]  When police and firefighters arrived, they threw illegal firecrackers at them
[3:13:01.000 --> 3:13:05.000]  and fired rockets and fireworks ammunition from alarm guns into the classrooms.
[3:13:05.000 --> 3:13:07.000]  So it's not just that they attack.
[3:13:07.000 --> 3:13:09.000]  They set the cars on fire.
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:11.000]  They throw fireworks at people in the street.
[3:13:11.000 --> 3:13:16.000]  They set schools on fire and then set off fireworks within the schools.
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:20.000]  When the firefighters arrive, when the police arrive, they don't leave.
[3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:22.000]  They then attack them too.
[3:13:22.000 --> 3:13:24.000]  Because again, this is about sending a message.
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:30.000]  This is our space where occupying this space do not interfere or you may get hurt.
[3:13:30.000 --> 3:13:37.000]  The firecrackers exploded through the destroyed windows directly in the classroom amongst the firefighters.
[3:13:37.000 --> 3:13:42.000]  Police officers from Berauschweig and Giefporn were called in to assist
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:45.000]  with whose assistance situation could finally be brought under control.
[3:13:45.000 --> 3:13:51.000]  The rioters aged 18 to 23 resisted arrest and had to be handcuffed.
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:13:55.000]  So again, it's not as if they attack these places and then run away.
[3:13:55.000 --> 3:13:57.000]  They stay.
[3:13:57.000 --> 3:13:59.000]  Here's another one.
[3:13:59.000 --> 3:14:01.000]  This is out of HLN.
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:06.000]  Dutch funeral procession pelted with fireworks.
[3:14:06.000 --> 3:14:08.000]  New Year's Eve in Ede, Netherlands.
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:10.000]  Young people again.
[3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:16.000]  It's just young people, so many young people throwing fireworks at funeral processions
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:19.000]  and firefighters and setting fire to schools.
[3:14:19.000 --> 3:14:23.000]  What is going on with these young people?
[3:14:23.000 --> 3:14:26.000]  The procession was on its way to a cemetery.
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:30.000]  Funeral director Hans van der Veerd walked ahead of the funeral car.
[3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:33.000]  Young people threw fireworks at van der Veerd and the funeral car.
[3:14:33.000 --> 3:14:38.000]  The procession was en route from van der Veerd at Utsvog to a cemetery.
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:41.000]  He said, you are shocked when you walk there and they throw it at you.
[3:14:41.000 --> 3:14:45.000]  I asked for respect for the funeral procession and asked how they would feel
[3:14:45.000 --> 3:14:49.000]  if they had to lose someone and if the funeral procession would be pelted with fireworks.
[3:14:49.000 --> 3:14:54.000]  Imagine having such little respect for a funeral procession.
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:57.000]  People grieving, people crying, people are upset.
[3:14:57.000 --> 3:15:01.000]  They're burying their loved one on New Year's Eve.
[3:15:01.000 --> 3:15:08.000]  Out of nowhere, gangs of young people start throwing fireworks at the funeral cars.
[3:15:08.000 --> 3:15:10.000]  Absolutely despicable.
[3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:17.000]  You scroll to the end of this article and it shows some kind of cleanup crew
[3:15:17.000 --> 3:15:19.000]  reacting to the aftermath of this.
[3:15:19.000 --> 3:15:25.000]  Then, off to the side of the photo, you can see who these young people are.
[3:15:25.000 --> 3:15:29.000]  Once again, they're from a certain demographic.
[3:15:29.000 --> 3:15:35.000]  So once again, in Paris, Strasbourg, Brussels, across the Netherlands, across Germany,
[3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:41.000]  we had yet another night of very exciting cultural enrichment.
[3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:46.000]  Again, from a certain demographic of young people and it seems to be a trend
[3:15:46.000 --> 3:15:49.000]  that across the continent is only getting worse.
[3:15:49.000 --> 3:15:59.000]  Now go away, we'll be back.
[3:16:20.000 --> 3:16:24.000]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program

[3:17:26.000 --> 3:17:31.000]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:17:31.000 --> 3:17:36.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[3:17:40.000 --> 3:17:43.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[3:17:43.000 --> 3:18:10.000]  Call 800-34 no tax or go to my website, danpilla.com. That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:18:10.000 --> 3:18:22.000]  You can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus. I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[3:18:22.000 --> 3:18:27.000]  It's incredible. So do yourself a favor. Try out the products if you've been on the fence.
[3:18:27.000 --> 3:18:30.000]  You can't lose except if you don't take action.
[3:18:30.000 --> 3:18:37.000]  Because when you buy the products you're funding the operation that is always delivering thanks to your support and God's grace in our action.
[3:18:37.000 --> 3:18:42.000]  But you need these products. That's the real reason you want to get them is because they're amazing.
[3:18:42.000 --> 3:18:46.000]  And then when you get great results please tell others about it word of mouth.
[3:18:46.000 --> 3:18:50.000]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO instead of imploding.
[3:18:50.000 --> 3:18:53.000]  We're fighting to win and we are winning. Thanks to you.
[3:18:53.000 --> 3:18:56.000]  The best product. I'm not supposed to be biased but I'm going to tell you all now.
[3:18:56.000 --> 3:18:58.000]  If you haven't tried turbo force you need to try it.
[3:18:58.000 --> 3:19:00.000]  I've tried turbo force with everything.
[3:19:00.000 --> 3:19:04.000]  Sometimes you know I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in my coffee.
[3:19:04.000 --> 3:19:09.000]  That was a crazy week. I don't remember sleeping but as far as the products go turbo force is my favorite.
[3:19:09.000 --> 3:19:13.000]  And all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health.
[3:19:13.000 --> 3:19:16.000]  Not relying on other people to do it for you.
[3:19:16.000 --> 3:19:22.000]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[3:19:22.000 --> 3:19:28.000]  I'm going to wake up today. You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer.
[3:19:28.000 --> 3:19:30.000]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[3:19:30.000 --> 3:19:34.000]  I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[3:19:34.000 --> 3:19:37.000]  Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way?
[3:19:37.000 --> 3:19:40.000]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that and that was me.
[3:19:40.000 --> 3:19:43.000]  I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[3:19:43.000 --> 3:19:46.000]  I want to take control of my health and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com.
[3:19:46.000 --> 3:19:48.000]  Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[3:19:48.000 --> 3:19:51.000]  Don't buy into the group think. Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the turbo force.
[3:19:51.000 --> 3:20:01.000]  Kool-Aid's bad and the turbo force is good.
[3:20:22.000 --> 3:20:26.000]  We've had massive protests in one area of Germany.
[3:20:26.000 --> 3:20:31.000]  Headline protests after German state broadcaster features children singing about their grandmas being,
[3:20:31.000 --> 3:20:36.000]  quote, environmental pigs for eating meat.
[3:20:36.000 --> 3:20:44.000]  Now, of course, I did a video. I think it was probably a couple of years back now called the mass brainwashing of Germany,
[3:20:44.000 --> 3:20:50.000]  which by the way is banned in Germany, even though they've literally got laws in their constitution about
[3:20:50.000 --> 3:20:58.000]  propaganda and censorship given their history, not just with Nazi Germany, but with Stasi East Germany.
[3:20:58.000 --> 3:21:03.000]  And that video made the point that even in the soap operas being broadcast on German television,
[3:21:03.000 --> 3:21:10.000]  they literally have soap opera narrative storylines where children are being made to convert to Islam
[3:21:10.000 --> 3:21:14.000]  and doing the Shaheeda and all the prayers and everything like that.
[3:21:14.000 --> 3:21:24.000]  They have white blonde 5 foot 10 women on adverts parading around in hijabs saying embrace tolerance.
[3:21:24.000 --> 3:21:31.000]  And now they had German broadcaster WDR2 facing protests after it broadcast a video,
[3:21:31.000 --> 3:21:35.000]  which a group of children were taught to sing about how their grandmas were environmental pigs
[3:21:35.000 --> 3:21:38.000]  driving non-electric vehicles and eating meat.
[3:21:38.000 --> 3:21:44.000]  This was about a two minute video. The backlash was so huge that they had to delete it off the Internet,
[3:21:44.000 --> 3:21:48.000]  which I don't think it should ever be deleted. It should be used as an example.
[3:21:48.000 --> 3:21:54.000]  But the kids sing quote, my grandma drives in the chicken coop with her motorcycle.
[3:21:54.000 --> 3:21:59.000]  That's thousands of gallons of gas every month. My grandma is an old environmentalist pig.
[3:21:59.000 --> 3:22:05.000]  So they're literally indoctrinating these kids to hate their parents because they're, you know,
[3:22:05.000 --> 3:22:09.000]  not upon all the climate change hysteria, not conforming enough.
[3:22:09.000 --> 3:22:16.000]  And another part of the song, the children sing, every day my grandma frees herself, fries herself a pork chop.
[3:22:16.000 --> 3:22:22.000]  She does it because discount meat costs nearly nothing. My grandma is an old environmental pig.
[3:22:22.000 --> 3:22:29.000]  So God forbid your grandma in a country which has increasingly abandoned the working class and old people,
[3:22:29.000 --> 3:22:35.000]  and indeed lower middle class people, rural people, which is why in countries like Holland and Germany,
[3:22:35.000 --> 3:22:41.000]  now the farmers in their tractors will turn up and do mass protests and mass blockades in major cities.
[3:22:41.000 --> 3:22:49.000]  Those people are being abandoned, but God forbid they should spend what measly disposable income they have left on meat.
[3:22:49.000 --> 3:22:58.000]  That's bad. I mean, literally even as late as the late 1980s in China, beef was a delicacy that, you know,
[3:22:58.000 --> 3:23:01.000]  even the middle class families could probably have once a month.
[3:23:01.000 --> 3:23:07.000]  But God forbid some elderly German who's paid into the state into the system her entire life,
[3:23:07.000 --> 3:23:12.000]  maybe even survived the horrible events of the 30s and the 40s.
[3:23:12.000 --> 3:23:17.000]  God forbid she should spend some of what disposable income she has left on meat.
[3:23:17.000 --> 3:23:19.000]  That's bad for the planet.
[3:23:19.000 --> 3:23:25.000]  So we're going to indoctrinate these kids who look to be about, I don't know, 10 to 12 years old,
[3:23:25.000 --> 3:23:33.000]  literally to throw their own grandmothers under a bus for Gaia, for Greta Thunberg, for the planet,
[3:23:33.000 --> 3:23:39.000]  an almost immediate backlash prompt to WDR2 to delete the online version of the clip again.
[3:23:39.000 --> 3:23:41.000]  That shouldn't have been the reaction.
[3:23:41.000 --> 3:23:48.000]  The reaction should have been to bombard the comments with what this actually represents.
[3:23:48.000 --> 3:23:53.000]  Before angry grandmas descended on WDR's office in Cologne to protest against the broadcaster.
[3:23:53.000 --> 3:24:00.000]  So then what made this even more ridiculous is that people started fanning the flames of hysteria once again
[3:24:00.000 --> 3:24:04.000]  and claiming that neo-Nazis were hijacking this legitimate anger.
[3:24:04.000 --> 3:24:10.000]  So then Antifa radicals literally turned up to protest a bunch of grandmas.
[3:24:10.000 --> 3:24:15.000]  And you can see actually in this clip, we're not playing the audio, of course, it's all in German.
[3:24:15.000 --> 3:24:22.000]  But if you go and watch it on this article at summit.news, the grandmas are getting heckled by Antifa.
[3:24:22.000 --> 3:24:26.000]  So that now Antifa's new enemy apparently is German grandmas.
[3:24:26.000 --> 3:24:28.000]  You don't like being called pigs on television.
[3:24:28.000 --> 3:24:32.000]  You don't like their children being indoctrinated to hate them.
[3:24:32.000 --> 3:24:35.000]  That makes you a fascist.
[3:24:35.000 --> 3:24:40.000]  One of them said one of the signs that the protest said we are grandmas, not Nazi pigs.
[3:24:40.000 --> 3:24:43.000]  While another sign said my grandma is an old environmental pig.
[3:24:43.000 --> 3:24:50.000]  WDR exploits children to slander the elderly, shameful stop causing division.
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:24:56.000]  Another one of protestors said if one of my children were to allow one of their children to sing something like this,
[3:24:56.000 --> 3:25:00.000]  which would never be the case, the SHIT would really hit the fan.
[3:25:00.000 --> 3:25:04.000]  Without us grandmas, this country would have crapped out a long time ago.
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:10.000]  So we had a lot of angry grandmas and a lot of angry Antifa activists protesting the grandmas.
[3:25:10.000 --> 3:25:17.000]  Again, because this television station thought it was a good idea to indoctrinate kids into hating their own families
[3:25:17.000 --> 3:25:24.000]  because they're not eating, you know, impossible whopper, estrogen filled soy burgers.
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:28.000]  Commentators warned the backlash is being exploited by right wing extremists,
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:31.000]  prompting an Antifa presence.
[3:25:31.000 --> 3:25:34.000]  The whole controversy was later dubbed Ranmar Gate.
[3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:37.000]  So that's what's happening in Germany.
[3:25:37.000 --> 3:25:43.000]  Meanwhile, on the subject of the environment, we are now two days into 2020
[3:25:43.000 --> 3:25:49.000]  and London and major European cities have not sunk into the sea.
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:51.000]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:25:51.000 --> 3:25:56.000]  Climate change experts have been proven wrong once again.
[3:25:56.000 --> 3:25:58.000]  Well, imagine my shock.
[3:25:58.000 --> 3:26:02.000]  According to experts, climate change will result in millions of deaths.
[3:26:02.000 --> 3:26:06.000]  Major European cities being sunk in nuclear war and global environmental riots.
[3:26:06.000 --> 3:26:12.000]  And they said all that would happen by before or by 2020.
[3:26:12.000 --> 3:26:17.000]  They made the prediction back in 2004 and said it would happen by 2020,
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:21.000]  which is now, of course, in its second day.
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:24.000]  Now they're saying the Australian bushfires, that's due to climate change,
[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:30.000]  even though it's not due to a natural climatic phenomenon that emerges out the Indian Ocean.
[3:26:30.000 --> 3:26:33.000]  But Bernie Sanders is on Twitter saying this is why we need the Green New Deal.
[3:26:33.000 --> 3:26:38.000]  Because again, climate control policies are not about controlling the climate.
[3:26:38.000 --> 3:26:40.000]  They're about controlling you.
[3:26:40.000 --> 3:26:44.000]  And they've been proven wrong time and time again.
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:49.000]  Going back to as far as 1968 with Paul Ehrlich, one of the original, you know,
[3:26:49.000 --> 3:26:53.000]  grandfathers of the big global warming hysteria climate change movement,
[3:26:53.000 --> 3:26:58.000]  writing in the population bomb that literally hundreds of millions of humans
[3:26:58.000 --> 3:27:02.000]  across the planet would starve to death by the 1980s didn't happen.
[3:27:02.000 --> 3:27:09.000]  Al Gore saying that the Arctic would be have ice free summers by 2013 did not happen.
[3:27:09.000 --> 3:27:14.000]  And in this article from the Guardian, February 22, 2004,
[3:27:14.000 --> 3:27:18.000]  they said climate change over the next 20 years could result in a global catastrophe
[3:27:18.000 --> 3:27:21.000]  costing millions of lives in wars and natural disasters.
[3:27:21.000 --> 3:27:26.000]  A secret report, ones that European cities will be sunk beneath rising seas
[3:27:26.000 --> 3:27:31.000]  as Britain is plunged into a Siberian climate by 2020.
[3:27:31.000 --> 3:27:33.000]  Now Siberia is pretty cold.
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:40.000]  But I guess, you know, the new the new doctrine is any extreme weather is global warming is climate change.
[3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:43.000]  So suffice to say we're in the second day of 2020.
[3:27:43.000 --> 3:27:46.000]  UK is not being plunged into Siberian climate.
[3:27:46.000 --> 3:27:49.000]  They went on to say nuclear conflict, mega droughts, famine and widespread
[3:27:49.000 --> 3:27:51.000]  rioting will erupt across the world.
[3:27:51.000 --> 3:27:55.000]  Well, we've seen a lot riots, but they're not rioting because of climate change.
[3:27:55.000 --> 3:28:00.000]  In fact, the irony irony is in many European countries, they're rioting
[3:28:00.000 --> 3:28:05.000]  because of climate change policies passed by governments who are grabbing control
[3:28:05.000 --> 3:28:08.000]  after fanning the flames of hysteria about climate change.
[3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:14.000]  We saw in the Netherlands attempts to slash beef production by up to 50%.
[3:28:14.000 --> 3:28:17.000]  That's why they were out on the streets protesting.
[3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:18.000]  They weren't rioting.
[3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:25.000]  We saw similar things in France with the Macron's government attempting to hike gas taxes.
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:27.000]  That's why the French farmers were out on the streets.
[3:28:27.000 --> 3:28:31.000]  That was one of the main drivers we took behind the yellow vest protests.
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:35.000]  So they're not rioting because of global environmental catastrophes.
[3:28:35.000 --> 3:28:42.000]  They're rioting because of the legislation and controlled mechanisms passed by governments
[3:28:42.000 --> 3:28:50.000]  in response to the hysteria that they generated, hysteria predicted by experts that never came to pass.
[3:28:50.000 --> 3:28:52.000]  Don't go away. We'll be back.
[3:28:52.000 --> 3:28:55.000]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[3:28:55.000 --> 3:28:58.000]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[3:28:58.000 --> 3:29:05.000]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.
[3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:10.000]  That's why you need FlashRouters, a custom Wi-Fi router created for privacy.

[3:29:46.000 --> 3:29:53.000]  Protect your wireless home network today with FlashRouters.
[3:29:53.000 --> 3:30:11.000]  I keep my eye on the news all the time, but I miss the fact that in late 2019, just about two weeks ago, the CDC and the FDA approved live Ebola vaccine to be given inside the United States.
[3:30:11.000 --> 3:30:15.000]  And it is an experimental vaccine. It is live.
[3:30:15.000 --> 3:30:21.000]  It's not even attenuated. They've just genetically modified it, so it's supposedly not lethal.
[3:30:21.000 --> 3:30:27.000]  Same stuff they did with the Gardasil vaccine that's admittedly killed and maimed so many.
[3:30:27.000 --> 3:30:29.000]  This is just crazy.
[3:30:29.000 --> 3:30:36.000]  And the Congos have the biggest outbreaks of Ebola ever since they started giving the vaccine there in the last few years.
[3:30:36.000 --> 3:30:43.000]  Oh, and of course, open the borders up here and letting people in unvetted the Democrats distribute across the country.
[3:30:43.000 --> 3:30:50.000]  You cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity, and it is an attempted Ebola assault on America.
[3:30:50.000 --> 3:30:53.000]  This is the New World Order.
[3:30:53.000 --> 3:30:58.000]  It's either happened to every person listening or it's happened to someone you know.
[3:30:58.000 --> 3:31:08.000]  Everybody is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu have taken the flu vaccine right before they get it,
[3:31:08.000 --> 3:31:13.000]  and that they get the worst case of the flu of their life.
[3:31:13.000 --> 3:31:22.000]  But still, like concentration camp victims, they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics to get the injections.
[3:31:22.000 --> 3:31:28.000]  It doesn't matter that studies, mainline government studies in Canada and Europe show that when you take the flu vaccine,
[3:31:28.000 --> 3:31:33.000]  it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season by lowering your immunity.
[3:31:33.000 --> 3:31:39.000]  It goes on and on, or the fact that the governments have never guessed the next year's mutation,
[3:31:39.000 --> 3:31:43.000]  that the flu vaccine has never, ever even worked.
[3:31:43.000 --> 3:31:47.000]  But how do you prevent the hoax? You keep the giant hoax going.
[3:31:47.000 --> 3:31:52.000]  No wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on record happening right now.
[3:31:52.000 --> 3:31:55.000]  Andy in Florida. Thank you, Andy. Go ahead.
[3:31:55.000 --> 3:31:57.000]  Hey, Alex. I love you, man. We love you.
[3:31:57.000 --> 3:32:01.000]  Before I go ahead and talk about the topic on hand, I got to talk about one of your product.
[3:32:01.000 --> 3:32:06.000]  A little bit about me. I'm 245 pounds. I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS.
[3:32:06.000 --> 3:32:09.000]  And make a long story short, I used to have a problem with Adderall.
[3:32:09.000 --> 3:32:14.000]  I do have ADHD, but, you know, I was taking Adderall for its energy boosting properties.
[3:32:14.000 --> 3:32:18.000]  You know, I kind of got a little out of hand, and, you know, I listen to you religiously in my truck every day.
[3:32:18.000 --> 3:32:23.000]  So I tried your turbo force, and really, it's a cliche, this product changed my life,
[3:32:23.000 --> 3:32:25.000]  but turbo force really changed my life.
[3:32:25.000 --> 3:32:32.000]  And it was a day I'd no longer take Adderall, and I get by literally 13 hours a day I work on a half of a packet of your turbo force.
[3:32:32.000 --> 3:32:35.000]  And if you take a half a packet, that's literally a dollar a day.
[3:32:35.000 --> 3:32:39.000]  And you save so much money versus, you know, a monster, which is what, $4.99.
[3:32:39.000 --> 3:32:42.000]  And, you know, I just had to call and tell you guys how great turbo force is.
[3:32:42.000 --> 3:32:44.000]  And if anybody's on the fence, they really have to try it.
[3:32:44.000 --> 3:32:46.000]  We're really proud of turbo force, so thank you, sir.

[3:32:56.000 --> 3:33:19.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:19.000 --> 3:33:28.000]  And I'm going to throw to this video now because generally speaking at this time of year, all the time just gone obviously with the Christmas period now just about over.
[3:33:28.000 --> 3:33:37.000]  A lot of people always flash back and remember the Christmas troops, which of course is the story of how the German and British troops had a Christmas truce,
[3:33:37.000 --> 3:33:48.000]  had a coming together of brotherhood despite the war that they were waging to stage a football match on, I think it was Christmas Eve back during World War I.
[3:33:48.000 --> 3:33:50.000]  There's another story which is quite similar.
[3:33:50.000 --> 3:33:57.000]  It evokes some similar feelings to that which came out of Poland, which I didn't know anything about this story.
[3:33:57.000 --> 3:33:59.000]  And I'm going to let the video speak for itself.
[3:33:59.000 --> 3:34:04.000]  This is a short documentary created by my friend Stefan Thompson.
[3:34:04.000 --> 3:34:10.000]  And the story is about the incredible story of Wojciech, the Polish bear that went to war.
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:16.000]  We're going to roll this video right now.
[3:34:16.000 --> 3:34:21.000]  The Second World War was a time of great chaos, loss and tragedy.
[3:34:21.000 --> 3:34:25.000]  This however is a heartwarming story set in those incredibly difficult days.
[3:34:25.000 --> 3:34:30.000]  It's the story of Wojciech, a Polish war hero who just happened to be a bear.
[3:34:30.000 --> 3:34:37.000]  This remarkable story starts in Poland with the start of World War II where Poles had it particularly rough.
[3:34:37.000 --> 3:34:42.000]  Poland was invaded on the 1st of September 1939 by Nazi Germany.
[3:34:42.000 --> 3:34:46.000]  Just 16 days later, the Soviets invaded from the east.
[3:34:46.000 --> 3:34:50.000]  The occupiers split the country according to the Ribbentrop Molotov Pact.
[3:34:50.000 --> 3:34:53.000]  Both occupations were brutal.
[3:34:53.000 --> 3:34:59.000]  The Soviets deported some 800,000 Poles to camps in the depths of the USSR.
[3:34:59.000 --> 3:35:05.000]  However, in the spring of 1941, following the German invasion of the Soviet Union,
[3:35:05.000 --> 3:35:08.000]  the Soviets re-established relations with the Poles.
[3:35:08.000 --> 3:35:14.000]  Under the Szikorski-Majski agreement, the Russians agreed to release thousands of Polish prisoners of war
[3:35:14.000 --> 3:35:17.000]  and permit them to form an army.
[3:35:17.000 --> 3:35:20.000]  General WÅadysÅaw Anders was tasked with the operation.
[3:35:20.000 --> 3:35:25.000]  He evacuated his newly formed army along with tens of thousands of civilians
[3:35:25.000 --> 3:35:31.000]  whom he rescued out of the Soviet prison camps to the freedom of British-controlled northern Persia.
[3:35:31.000 --> 3:35:37.000]  At a railroad station in Hamadan, the Polish soldiers encountered a young Kurdish boy with a bear cub.
[3:35:37.000 --> 3:35:39.000]  The cub's mother had been shot by hunters.
[3:35:39.000 --> 3:35:45.000]  The bear was barely alive, tired and hungry, much like the Poles who had survived Soviet gulags
[3:35:45.000 --> 3:35:48.000]  and had been marching for hundreds of kilometers.
[3:35:48.000 --> 3:35:52.000]  Taken with the cuddly bear pup, the soldiers exchanged him for some Persian coins,
[3:35:52.000 --> 3:35:58.000]  a portion of chocolate, a Swiss army knife and a tin of beef, and nursed it back to health.
[3:35:58.000 --> 3:36:04.000]  They fed him milk from an old vodka bottle, and as the bear grew, they fed him fruit, marmalade and honey.
[3:36:04.000 --> 3:36:09.000]  Quickly, the bear became an important member of the 22nd Artillery Supply Company.
[3:36:09.000 --> 3:36:14.000]  The endeared soldiers named the bear Wojtek, which means happy warrior.
[3:36:14.000 --> 3:36:18.000]  As Wojtek grew up among soldiers, he adopted soldierly habits.
[3:36:18.000 --> 3:36:21.000]  He learned how to salute and march on his hind legs.
[3:36:21.000 --> 3:36:24.000]  He was also taught to watch over trucks by sitting in the driver's cabin
[3:36:24.000 --> 3:36:27.000]  and would often accompany his comrades on guard duty.
[3:36:27.000 --> 3:36:30.000]  He developed a particular love for playboxing and wrestling.
[3:36:30.000 --> 3:36:36.000]  He adored challenging other soldiers to wrestling matches, even fighting for opponents at a time.
[3:36:36.000 --> 3:36:41.000]  He would hide his claws and enjoy rolling with them on the floor, slamming them and pretending to bite them.
[3:36:41.000 --> 3:36:45.000]  However, he would never ever do harm to anybody.
[3:36:45.000 --> 3:36:48.000]  He also picked up some less salubrious habits.
[3:36:48.000 --> 3:36:52.000]  He learned how to smoke cigarettes, though he usually ate them after a single puff,
[3:36:52.000 --> 3:36:54.000]  and he developed a great love for beer.
[3:36:54.000 --> 3:36:57.000]  Upon finishing a bottle, he would look through the opening of the bottle
[3:36:57.000 --> 3:37:00.000]  looking to see where his favorite drink was gone.
[3:37:00.000 --> 3:37:04.000]  And then he looked with one eye down to see if there was anything left.
[3:37:04.000 --> 3:37:07.000]  Then he looked with the other eye to see if there was anything left.
[3:37:07.000 --> 3:37:09.000]  And then he smashed the bottle.
[3:37:09.000 --> 3:37:14.000]  Wojtek the Bear, the mascot of the 22nd Company, travelled with them tirelessly.
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:18.000]  From Iran to Iraq, then Syria and on to Palestine and Egypt.
[3:37:18.000 --> 3:37:25.000]  From Egypt, the Polish Second Corps was tasked to travel to Europe to join the Allied Italian Campaign.
[3:37:25.000 --> 3:37:28.000]  Since the transport of pet animals was strictly forbidden,
[3:37:28.000 --> 3:37:32.000]  the Poles improvised and officially drafted Wojtek into the Polish Army.
[3:37:32.000 --> 3:37:37.000]  He was given the rank of private, a service number and his very own paybook,
[3:37:37.000 --> 3:37:39.000]  though he was only ever paid in food.
[3:37:39.000 --> 3:37:44.000]  And thus, Private Wojtek was allowed to board the British ships.
[3:37:44.000 --> 3:37:47.000]  Wojtek was known to be particularly fond of the water,
[3:37:47.000 --> 3:37:50.000]  as the Polish troops travelled up the Italian Adriatic coast.
[3:37:50.000 --> 3:37:54.000]  Upon spotting the sea, Wojtek leapt out of the truck and bounded towards a beach,
[3:37:54.000 --> 3:37:57.000]  terrifying the sunbathing girls.
[3:37:57.000 --> 3:37:59.000]  However, the Poles were not in Italy for a holiday,
[3:37:59.000 --> 3:38:02.000]  and Wojtek would soon swap the beach for a battlefield.
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:06.000]  The Italian Campaign was one of the bloodiest campaigns of the war.
[3:38:06.000 --> 3:38:08.000]  The Allies had been stuck for several months,
[3:38:08.000 --> 3:38:12.000]  blocked by the German winterline, which guarded the way to Rome.
[3:38:12.000 --> 3:38:17.000]  In the Allies' way lay the historic hilltop abbey of Monte Cassino,
[3:38:17.000 --> 3:38:21.000]  inhabited now by German soldiers rather than monks.
[3:38:21.000 --> 3:38:26.000]  Wojtek, like his human counterparts, experienced and endured the horrors of war.
[3:38:26.000 --> 3:38:30.000]  In May of 1944, he came under shellfire for the very first time.
[3:38:30.000 --> 3:38:33.000]  Upon seeing his fellow soldiers carrying crates of ammunition,
[3:38:33.000 --> 3:38:36.000]  Wojtek responded to the call of duty and joined in,
[3:38:36.000 --> 3:38:42.000]  standing on his hind legs and extending his arms to carry 100-pound crates of artillery shells.
[3:38:42.000 --> 3:38:46.000]  Alone, he lifted what normally required four men.
[3:38:46.000 --> 3:38:50.000]  On the 18th of May, the Poles succeeded where three other Allied units had failed.
[3:38:50.000 --> 3:38:54.000]  They captured the strategically vital mountain fortress of Monte Cassino.
[3:38:54.000 --> 3:38:59.000]  We couldn't do it, and the Canadians and Americans couldn't do it.
[3:38:59.000 --> 3:39:06.000]  There were four different battles of Monte Cassino,
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:09.000]  and the fifth one went to the Poles.
[3:39:09.000 --> 3:39:13.000]  They won it in the most gallant way I've ever seen.
[3:39:13.000 --> 3:39:15.000]  Very, very brave men.
[3:39:15.000 --> 3:39:21.000]  The exhausted soldiers triumphantly raised a Polish flag over the ruins of the monastery.
[3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:24.000]  For his courage and willingness to participate in the battle,
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:26.000]  Wojtek was promoted to the rank of corporal,
[3:39:26.000 --> 3:39:29.000]  and with the approval of the Polish High Command,
[3:39:29.000 --> 3:39:36.000]  the 22nd Artillery Supply Company's badge was changed to a bear, carrying an artillery shell.
[3:39:36.000 --> 3:39:40.000]  The war was won not long after, but Poland was betrayed at the Yalta Conference,
[3:39:40.000 --> 3:39:43.000]  and Poland fell on the Soviet side of the Iron Curtain
[3:39:43.000 --> 3:39:46.000]  and was now ruled by a brutal communist regime.
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:52.000]  Tens of thousands of Polish soldiers and one soldier bear ended up in exile.
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:39:57.000]  The 22nd Company, along with Wojtek, was transported to a settlement camp in Scotland,
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:40:01.000]  and in 1947 the troops were demobilized.
[3:40:01.000 --> 3:40:05.000]  It was time for the soldiers to say goodbye to their most unlikely of companions.
[3:40:05.000 --> 3:40:09.000]  The demobilized soldiers entrusted Wojtek to Adam Brezut,
[3:40:09.000 --> 3:40:12.000]  hoping to take him to Poland once it was free.
[3:40:12.000 --> 3:40:17.000]  It was not to be, however, and Wojtek spent the rest of his days in a 10 square meter enclosure,
[3:40:17.000 --> 3:40:20.000]  a very long way away from his natural habitat.
[3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:24.000]  In a sense, his fate mirrored that of tens of thousands of Polish soldiers.
[3:40:24.000 --> 3:40:28.000]  Homeless heroes, scattered across the globe,
[3:40:28.000 --> 3:40:30.000]  unable to return to their occupied homeland,
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:34.000]  which was ruled with an iron fist by the communists.
[3:40:34.000 --> 3:40:38.000]  Wojtek's years in the zoo made him increasingly isolated and depressed,
[3:40:38.000 --> 3:40:41.000]  but the Polish soldiers did not forget their cherished companion.
[3:40:41.000 --> 3:40:45.000]  They would come to the zoo, often jumping into the enclosure to wrestle with him,
[3:40:45.000 --> 3:40:47.000]  and gifted him with cigarettes and beer.
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:50.000]  Wojtek also never forgot his comrades in arms.
[3:40:50.000 --> 3:40:53.000]  Whenever he heard Polish spoken of the zoo,
[3:40:53.000 --> 3:40:58.000]  the old soldier bear would stand on his hind legs and wave a paw, as if in salute.
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:41:02.000]  Similarly to so many Poles who never saw their beloved homeland again,
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:10.000]  Wojtek died in 1963, in captivity, far away from his friends, his birthplace, and his natural habitat.
[3:41:10.000 --> 3:41:17.000]  He was truly a paw, in the sense that he lived amongst them, he was one of them.
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:20.000]  They couldn't separate the one from the other,
[3:41:20.000 --> 3:41:25.000]  and the only tragedy is that we were never able to get him back to Poland.
[3:41:25.000 --> 3:41:30.000]  His adoptive homeland, the country he served and fought for in the Second World War.
[3:41:30.000 --> 3:41:47.000]  And that is the story of Wojtek, the Polish bear that went to war.
[3:41:47.000 --> 3:41:52.000]  They have an incredible story, Wojtek, the Polish bear that went to war,
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:56.000]  not really just the fact of the bear, but the fact that it became a mascot
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:42:01.000]  of the camaraderie of the troops and then the tragedy, of course,
[3:42:01.000 --> 3:42:06.000]  of the bear being stranded in a habitat a long way from its natural home,
[3:42:06.000 --> 3:42:09.000]  just as many Poles were after the war.
[3:42:09.000 --> 3:42:12.000]  That is a short film by Stefan Thompson.
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:14.000]  We're going to come back in the next segment.
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:16.000]  I'm going to talk about what's happening in Sweden.
[3:42:16.000 --> 3:42:18.000]  I'm going to talk about some positive news for a change,
[3:42:18.000 --> 3:42:22.000]  because there was a big Bank of America report that came out
[3:42:22.000 --> 3:42:28.000]  predicting the dominant trends of 2020, or for the 2020s, the entire decade.
[3:42:28.000 --> 3:42:30.000]  And they're not all negative.
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:34.000]  There is some hope, some element of a white pill in there,
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:38.000]  which will make you more positive about the 2020s going forward.
[3:42:38.000 --> 3:42:40.000]  We're going to come back and talk about that.
[3:42:40.000 --> 3:42:44.000]  We're also going to talk about London reaching its highest murder rate in a decade,
[3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:46.000]  the true reasons behind that.
[3:42:46.000 --> 3:42:50.000]  We'll be back in the final segment of the Aleksderm Show 4th Hour Summit.News.
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:42:54.000]  Don't go away.
[3:42:54.000 --> 3:42:58.000]  As I drive in to the Central Texas Information Warfare Command Center
[3:42:58.000 --> 3:43:03.000]  in Austin, Texas, it is January 2nd, 2020.
[3:43:03.000 --> 3:43:08.000]  And you only have four days left as of me taping this to take advantage
[3:43:08.000 --> 3:43:12.000]  of the biggest sales in the history of the fours,
[3:43:12.000 --> 3:43:17.000]  which we've escalated in the last year to sell out of all of our inventory
[3:43:17.000 --> 3:43:23.000]  to fund ourselves into 2020, and to be able to avoid inventory taxes.
[3:43:23.000 --> 3:43:26.000]  We are selling out of almost everything right now,
[3:43:26.000 --> 3:43:29.000]  or have already sold out many of our best-selling items.
[3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:31.000]  We have store-wide free shipping.

[3:43:52.000 --> 3:43:55.000]  I keep my eye on the news all the time,
[3:43:55.000 --> 3:44:00.000]  but I miss the fact that in late 2019, just about two weeks ago,
[3:44:00.000 --> 3:44:10.000]  the CDC and the FDA approved live Ebola vaccine to be given inside the United States.
[3:44:10.000 --> 3:44:14.000]  It is an experimental vaccine. It is live.
[3:44:14.000 --> 3:44:16.000]  It's not even attenuated.
[3:44:16.000 --> 3:44:20.000]  They've just genetically modified it, so it's supposedly not lethal.
[3:44:20.000 --> 3:44:26.000]  Same stuff they did with the Gardasil vaccine that's admittedly killed a name so many.
[3:44:26.000 --> 3:44:31.000]  This is just crazy, and the Congos had the biggest outbreaks of Ebola ever
[3:44:31.000 --> 3:44:35.000]  since they started giving the vaccine there in the last few years.
[3:44:35.000 --> 3:44:40.000]  Oh, and of course, open the borders up here and letting people in unfettered
[3:44:40.000 --> 3:44:42.000]  the Democrats distribute across the country.
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:49.000]  You cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity, and it is an attempted Ebola assault on America.
[3:44:49.000 --> 3:44:52.000]  This is the New World Order.
[3:44:52.000 --> 3:44:59.000]  Knock on wood. I am not tempting fate, but everybody around the office,
[3:44:59.000 --> 3:45:02.000]  especially folks that have worked there a long time,
[3:45:02.000 --> 3:45:05.000]  have noticed that I really don't ever get sick.
[3:45:05.000 --> 3:45:08.000]  Now, again, I might get sick tomorrow because I just made that statement.
[3:45:08.000 --> 3:45:10.000]  I'm not tempting fate.
[3:45:10.000 --> 3:45:13.000]  I'll say that again because I am superstitious when it comes down to that.
[3:45:13.000 --> 3:45:17.000]  I'm very thankful to the good Lord for the Constitution I've been given.
[3:45:17.000 --> 3:45:24.000]  But up until about eight, nine years ago when I started taking X2 in the product's enforced life,
[3:45:24.000 --> 3:45:31.000]  I still got sick every couple years, and I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that.
[3:45:31.000 --> 3:45:36.000]  But now that I religiously take the products in infowars life,
[3:45:36.000 --> 3:45:39.000]  one of the highest quality supplements you're going to find out there,
[3:45:39.000 --> 3:45:42.000]  I just never get a fever anymore.
[3:45:42.000 --> 3:45:47.000]  It's probably been three, four years since I've had a fever.
[3:45:47.000 --> 3:45:49.000]  It's just crazy.
[3:45:49.000 --> 3:46:02.000]  So I chalk it up to genetics and the great products.
[3:46:19.000 --> 3:46:24.000]  I want to thank you for standing with us because you are the Infowars.
[3:46:24.000 --> 3:46:28.000]  I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[3:46:28.000 --> 3:46:32.000]  For the bottom of my heart, for my family, and for the great crew at Infowars,
[3:46:32.000 --> 3:46:35.000]  I want to thank you all because you are the Infowars,
[3:46:35.000 --> 3:46:38.000]  and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[3:46:38.000 --> 3:46:40.000]  You have made history.
[3:46:40.000 --> 3:46:42.000]  We have made history together.
[3:46:42.000 --> 3:46:46.000]  Infowars.com only has power because of you.
[3:46:46.000 --> 3:46:51.000]  And I suggest you use it.
[3:47:16.000 --> 3:47:25.000]  We are back on the fourth hour of the show before we head back into some final news stories.
[3:47:25.000 --> 3:47:29.000]  I want to tell you how it's really important that you do support this network
[3:47:29.000 --> 3:47:33.000]  by going to infowarsstore.com.
[3:47:33.000 --> 3:47:38.000]  Of course we had the news a couple of days ago that Alex's appearance on Joe Rogan
[3:47:38.000 --> 3:47:42.000]  was the most popular podcast of the entirety of 2019.
[3:47:42.000 --> 3:47:46.000]  You know, they say de-platforming works and that's right to a certain extent
[3:47:46.000 --> 3:47:48.000]  but it didn't really work in Alex Jones's case.
[3:47:48.000 --> 3:47:54.000]  One of the primary reasons behind that is because you did not relent in supporting
[3:47:54.000 --> 3:47:59.000]  the continued not only operation but expansion of this network.
[3:47:59.000 --> 3:48:04.000]  It's a massive outlay financially to do what we do which is why it's so important
[3:48:04.000 --> 3:48:09.000]  that you continue to support us by getting the great products at infowarsstore.com
[3:48:09.000 --> 3:48:12.000]  because if that hadn't have happened then nobody else would have survived
[3:48:12.000 --> 3:48:16.000]  what happened to Alex Jones in 2018 with the massive purge of the massive de-platforming
[3:48:16.000 --> 3:48:20.000]  of which he was the number one primary victim.
[3:48:20.000 --> 3:48:24.000]  The reason we managed to survive to this day over a year later
[3:48:24.000 --> 3:48:27.000]  is because you're getting the products at infowarsstore.com
[3:48:27.000 --> 3:48:34.000]  where we have the end of the year mega blowout sale up to 75% off a bunch of key products
[3:48:34.000 --> 3:48:37.000]  plus free shipping on top of that.
[3:48:37.000 --> 3:48:42.000]  We have the super blue fluoride free toothpaste now available for just $7.47
[3:48:42.000 --> 3:48:45.000]  again massively positive reviews.
[3:48:45.000 --> 3:48:51.000]  3,635 reviews almost all of them, you know, four or five stars
[3:48:51.000 --> 3:48:54.000]  got an average review of 4.8. You're going to buy toothpaste anyway.
[3:48:54.000 --> 3:48:57.000]  You're hopefully going to buy fluoride free toothpaste anyway
[3:48:57.000 --> 3:48:59.000]  unless you want to lose IQ points.
[3:48:59.000 --> 3:49:02.000]  So why not buy it from us and support this network?
[3:49:02.000 --> 3:49:09.000]  We also have of course turbo force, the ultimate energy drink, energy and metabolism.
[3:49:09.000 --> 3:49:11.000]  This is powerful.
[3:49:11.000 --> 3:49:15.000]  Again, I've said it many times before and it's 60% off by the way
[3:49:15.000 --> 3:49:17.000]  that is an absolutely huge discount.
[3:49:17.000 --> 3:49:19.000]  I think that's the biggest discount yet for turbo force.
[3:49:19.000 --> 3:49:20.000]  60% off.
[3:49:20.000 --> 3:49:23.000]  Go careful with it because it is extremely powerful.
[3:49:23.000 --> 3:49:26.000]  It will give you a massive boost of energy without the come down
[3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:28.000]  but it's really powerful.
[3:49:28.000 --> 3:49:32.000]  So be sure to maybe start off with taking half a sachet
[3:49:32.000 --> 3:49:34.000]  but it's available right now.
[3:49:34.000 --> 3:49:37.000]  Again, really good reviews 4.8 average review score.
[3:49:37.000 --> 3:49:39.000]  That is turbo force.
[3:49:39.000 --> 3:49:42.000]  We also have the Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein shirt
[3:49:42.000 --> 3:49:46.000]  which again has proven populace available for $22.45
[3:49:46.000 --> 3:49:49.000]  along with a bunch of other products.
[3:49:49.000 --> 3:49:55.000]  Available at infowarstore.com including brain force plus the neutropic supplement
[3:49:55.000 --> 3:50:00.000]  available right now. Some of these products discounted up to 75% off.
[3:50:00.000 --> 3:50:04.000]  That's probably one of if not the biggest discount I've ever seen
[3:50:04.000 --> 3:50:06.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[3:50:06.000 --> 3:50:10.000]  It's especially crucial to support us as we're heading into a new year
[3:50:10.000 --> 3:50:12.000]  as we're heading into an election year
[3:50:12.000 --> 3:50:15.000]  by taking advantage of those massive discounts
[3:50:15.000 --> 3:50:21.000]  and stocking up on the great products at infowarstore.com.
[3:50:21.000 --> 3:50:26.000]  National file reports 2019 London reaches highest murder rate in a decade.
[3:50:26.000 --> 3:50:29.000]  London experienced its highest number of murders in a decade
[3:50:29.000 --> 3:50:32.000]  in part due to a rise in gang related crime.
[3:50:32.000 --> 3:50:36.000]  There was another murder literally 10 minutes walk
[3:50:36.000 --> 3:50:41.000]  from where I'm sat right now in an area of London
[3:50:41.000 --> 3:50:44.000]  that you know it's not the most expensive area
[3:50:44.000 --> 3:50:46.000]  but it's by no means the worst.
[3:50:46.000 --> 3:50:50.000]  Literally now it's like every three weeks someone gets murdered.
[3:50:50.000 --> 3:50:52.000]  Of course no one cares.
[3:50:52.000 --> 3:50:54.000]  No one actually cares.
[3:50:54.000 --> 3:50:57.000]  We get all this virtue signaling about black lives matter
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:51:01.000]  and they'll even go to Heathrow Airport to protest against air pollution
[3:51:01.000 --> 3:51:03.000]  because they claim that's racist
[3:51:03.000 --> 3:51:06.000]  so long as they can get the selfie for Instagram.
[3:51:06.000 --> 3:51:09.000]  Black people are killing other black people mainly in droves.
[3:51:09.000 --> 3:51:12.000]  Nobody cares. Nobody gives a damn.
[3:51:12.000 --> 3:51:16.000]  There were 149 murders a little fear than one every two days
[3:51:16.000 --> 3:51:20.000]  in the capital city last year up from 135 in 2018.
[3:51:20.000 --> 3:51:22.000]  The number of murders increased by more than 50%
[3:51:22.000 --> 3:51:27.000]  in the previous decade rising from 94 cases in 2014.
[3:51:27.000 --> 3:51:30.000]  90 of the 149 murders were stabbings.
[3:51:30.000 --> 3:51:33.000]  And the one that happened here on Christmas Eve
[3:51:33.000 --> 3:51:37.000]  they just literally walked up to the guy's house,
[3:51:37.000 --> 3:51:39.000]  rang the doorbell and just shot him in the face
[3:51:39.000 --> 3:51:40.000]  in front of his family.
[3:51:40.000 --> 3:51:42.000]  Again it was gang related.
[3:51:42.000 --> 3:51:44.000]  It was a revenge attack.
[3:51:44.000 --> 3:51:48.000]  The vast majority of middle class white people living in these areas
[3:51:48.000 --> 3:51:52.000]  most of whom will vote for left wing parties
[3:51:52.000 --> 3:51:54.000]  who support mass immigration.
[3:51:54.000 --> 3:51:56.000]  One of the reasons why the violence has gotten worse
[3:51:56.000 --> 3:51:58.000]  in London in recent years
[3:51:58.000 --> 3:52:00.000]  is because the gangs that are already here
[3:52:00.000 --> 3:52:02.000]  are having to one up their level of violence
[3:52:02.000 --> 3:52:05.000]  to compete with the individuals coming in
[3:52:05.000 --> 3:52:08.000]  from the likes of the Congo and other countries in Africa
[3:52:08.000 --> 3:52:12.000]  where they're more used to this violence being completely normalized
[3:52:12.000 --> 3:52:16.000]  so then the British crime gangs have to up their game
[3:52:16.000 --> 3:52:19.000]  so the cycle of violence only gets worse.
[3:52:19.000 --> 3:52:22.000]  But again the left wing middle class people who live here
[3:52:22.000 --> 3:52:26.000]  do not care because it's not their kids that are getting murdered
[3:52:26.000 --> 3:52:28.000]  but they really care about black lives.
[3:52:28.000 --> 3:52:30.000]  Yeah right.
[3:52:30.000 --> 3:52:33.000]  They did a study by the way metropolitan police
[3:52:33.000 --> 3:52:41.000]  73% of knife offenders were from black or ethnic minority backgrounds.
[3:52:41.000 --> 3:52:44.000]  Interesting. Very interesting.
[3:52:44.000 --> 3:52:46.000]  But again nobody cares about it
[3:52:46.000 --> 3:52:48.000]  because it's not their kids getting killed.
[3:52:48.000 --> 3:52:52.000]  If they actually started killing middle class white art students
[3:52:52.000 --> 3:52:55.000]  then maybe people would pretend to care
[3:52:55.000 --> 3:52:57.000]  but as it is nobody really gives a damn.
[3:52:57.000 --> 3:52:59.000]  Speaking of diversity
[3:52:59.000 --> 3:53:02.000]  New York Times begins 2020 with feature story
[3:53:02.000 --> 3:53:05.000]  on how white people are bad for existing.
[3:53:05.000 --> 3:53:08.000]  Now this is interesting because the New York Times
[3:53:08.000 --> 3:53:11.000]  circled on the University of Wisconsin
[3:53:11.000 --> 3:53:14.000]  for putting out a video that was meant to unite people
[3:53:14.000 --> 3:53:17.000]  but because the video itself featured
[3:53:17.000 --> 3:53:20.000]  a lot of white people, not exclusively white people
[3:53:20.000 --> 3:53:23.000]  just a lot of white people, it was bad.
[3:53:23.000 --> 3:53:27.000]  It was terrible and it prompted a reckoning over race.
[3:53:27.000 --> 3:53:29.000]  That's what the New York Times said
[3:53:29.000 --> 3:53:32.000]  because virtually everyone in it was white.
[3:53:32.000 --> 3:53:37.000]  And as we know it's not okay to be white.
[3:53:37.000 --> 3:53:43.000]  Okay, Wisconsin is 85% white.
[3:53:43.000 --> 3:53:46.000]  This is the debate we have time and time again.
[3:53:46.000 --> 3:53:49.000]  This is the debate we have about representation in movies,
[3:53:49.000 --> 3:53:54.000]  representation in television, representation in employment.
[3:53:54.000 --> 3:53:57.000]  The UK for example, according to the last census
[3:53:57.000 --> 3:54:01.000]  is probably a bit less now, is 87% white.
[3:54:01.000 --> 3:54:04.000]  You look at the advertisements, the commercials,
[3:54:04.000 --> 3:54:07.000]  this is like 50, 60% black now.
[3:54:07.000 --> 3:54:10.000]  This is affirmative action on steroids
[3:54:10.000 --> 3:54:13.000]  but the New York Times got really angry over this.
[3:54:13.000 --> 3:54:16.000]  This anti-racist video put out by the University of Wisconsin
[3:54:16.000 --> 3:54:19.000]  because the majority of the people in the video are white.
[3:54:19.000 --> 3:54:23.000]  Yeah, 85% of their population is white
[3:54:23.000 --> 3:54:27.000]  and you can compare that interestingly enough
[3:54:27.000 --> 3:54:31.000]  which I did on Twitter to a advertisement on Facebook
[3:54:31.000 --> 3:54:34.000]  from a company called Fortune
[3:54:34.000 --> 3:54:37.000]  and it says this global apparel company is promoting
[3:54:37.000 --> 3:54:41.000]  diversity and inclusion in both the fashion industry
[3:54:41.000 --> 3:54:43.000]  and society at large.
[3:54:43.000 --> 3:54:46.000]  And diversity according to this advertisement
[3:54:46.000 --> 3:54:48.000]  is no white people.
[3:54:48.000 --> 3:54:50.000]  There's probably like two or three
[3:54:50.000 --> 3:54:52.000]  in the back of the advertisement.
[3:54:52.000 --> 3:54:55.000]  So if you actually promote diversity,
[3:54:55.000 --> 3:54:57.000]  if you want to call it that,
[3:54:57.000 --> 3:55:00.000]  but most of the people in accordance with the population
[3:55:00.000 --> 3:55:03.000]  level is white, 85%,
[3:55:03.000 --> 3:55:05.000]  in the case of the University of Wisconsin,
[3:55:05.000 --> 3:55:07.000]  that's bad, that's terrible
[3:55:07.000 --> 3:55:09.000]  because being white is innately bad.
[3:55:09.000 --> 3:55:11.000]  If you promote diversity
[3:55:11.000 --> 3:55:14.000]  and there are no white people in the advertisement,
[3:55:14.000 --> 3:55:17.000]  that's good and that should be celebrated.
[3:55:17.000 --> 3:55:19.000]  What does that tell you?
[3:55:19.000 --> 3:55:20.000]  Meanwhile, breast ironing,
[3:55:20.000 --> 3:55:22.000]  bushmeat and witchcraft,
[3:55:22.000 --> 3:55:25.000]  some of London's cultural enrichment.
[3:55:25.000 --> 3:55:28.000]  Again, very, very positive development
[3:55:28.000 --> 3:55:31.000]  and doesn't go to prove that some cultures are better than others.
[3:55:31.000 --> 3:55:33.000]  The assimilation to British culture
[3:55:33.000 --> 3:55:35.000]  hasn't been easy in some respects.
[3:55:35.000 --> 3:55:37.000]  As a result, some cultural hangovers can be witnessed,
[3:55:37.000 --> 3:55:39.000]  sometimes in the form of what would be deemed weird
[3:55:39.000 --> 3:55:41.000]  to the Anglo-centric worldview.
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:43.000]  Well, how dare you declare that as weird?
[3:55:43.000 --> 3:55:45.000]  As we know with moral relativism,
[3:55:45.000 --> 3:55:48.000]  all cultures are equal no matter how barbaric.
[3:55:48.000 --> 3:55:51.000]  Female genital mutilation is possibly the most
[3:55:51.000 --> 3:55:53.000]  known culturally incompatible practice,
[3:55:53.000 --> 3:55:56.000]  rampant in minority neighborhoods.
[3:55:56.000 --> 3:55:58.000]  Of course, the thing we've had
[3:55:58.000 --> 3:56:00.000]  was that one successful conviction
[3:56:00.000 --> 3:56:05.000]  of FGM mutilation in the UK ever, ever.
[3:56:05.000 --> 3:56:08.000]  However, in other lesser known predominantly African cultural throwbacks
[3:56:08.000 --> 3:56:11.000]  are being reported in London, sorry,
[3:56:11.000 --> 3:56:13.000]  another UK cities.
[3:56:13.000 --> 3:56:16.000]  One of them is called breast ironing.
[3:56:16.000 --> 3:56:18.000]  And again, according to leftists,
[3:56:18.000 --> 3:56:21.000]  all cultures are equal, moral relativism.
[3:56:21.000 --> 3:56:25.000]  The culture of breast ironing is as legitimate
[3:56:25.000 --> 3:56:29.000]  as any other culture from any other race of peoples.
[3:56:29.000 --> 3:56:32.000]  And this practice, breast ironing,
[3:56:32.000 --> 3:56:35.000]  which originated in West African countries,
[3:56:35.000 --> 3:56:38.000]  is used to divert male attention away from pubescent girls,
[3:56:38.000 --> 3:56:40.000]  which is similar to how they put
[3:56:40.000 --> 3:56:43.000]  five-year-old girls in hijabs,
[3:56:43.000 --> 3:56:47.000]  because they don't want men sexually lusting after them.
[3:56:47.000 --> 3:56:50.000]  Surely the problem should be with the men,
[3:56:50.000 --> 3:56:52.000]  not with covering up girls.
[3:56:52.000 --> 3:56:54.000]  But breast ironing is carried out
[3:56:54.000 --> 3:56:57.000]  using hot stones or iron onto young girls developing breasts
[3:56:57.000 --> 3:57:00.000]  to flatten the breast tissue or delay its natural development.
[3:57:00.000 --> 3:57:02.000]  Sounds completely normal, right?
[3:57:02.000 --> 3:57:05.000]  Sounds like something we should embrace in the name of diversity.
[3:57:05.000 --> 3:57:09.000]  The practice can cause long-lasting physical and emotional damage.
[3:57:09.000 --> 3:57:12.000]  It goes on to talk about another cultural practice
[3:57:12.000 --> 3:57:15.000]  that has been imported into London and the UK in recent years,
[3:57:15.000 --> 3:57:19.000]  which is eating chimpanzee meat.
[3:57:19.000 --> 3:57:23.000]  Again, probably won't sit well with the eco-warriors,
[3:57:23.000 --> 3:57:25.000]  but this is a process where chimpanzee meat
[3:57:25.000 --> 3:57:27.000]  at the cost of five times or greater than beef
