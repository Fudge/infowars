[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:20.960]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.960 --> 00:35.520]  here we are ladies and gentlemen the 22nd day of December 2011 on this Thursday edition
[00:38.480 --> 00:44.080]  I have some of the biggest news I've ever broken on this radio show today it began to
[00:44.080 --> 00:48.880]  break yesterday when one of our callers that has called him with a lot of really good tips
[00:48.880 --> 00:52.160]  because her husband works in the Department of Defense we interviewed him last night
[00:52.720 --> 00:57.040]  she said listen you didn't look at the right area in the documents that I've been sending you
[00:57.600 --> 01:03.600]  it talks about blue force awareness and how the military man's the FEMA camps and how the
[01:03.600 --> 01:10.480]  rest of the American people are the enemy and we went and got the documents off the federal
[01:10.480 --> 01:18.080]  government website and within an hour of it being posted at info wars.com with links to it
[01:18.080 --> 01:24.080]  they pulled it they pulled it first they started altering the document in live time we have the
[01:24.080 --> 01:31.360]  earlier one and then about by the time I talked about it on the radio but hadn't even you know
[01:31.360 --> 01:37.200]  done an official piece on it yet yesterday in the afternoon while we're still on air by the end
[01:37.200 --> 01:43.600]  of it they changed dates and remove things this is in live time on the big federal government
[01:43.600 --> 01:52.160]  homeland security department of defense contracting website and then by about an hour and a half after
[01:54.160 --> 01:57.920]  the article had been out at about six o'clock central six p.m central
[01:57.920 --> 02:01.680]  Aaron Dykes and I worked feverishly on top of doing the nightly news to get that out
[02:02.800 --> 02:08.000]  they removed it completely and put a notice about do not post classified information you know if
[02:08.000 --> 02:15.600]  you're a federal employee issuing contracts implying that it was classified and I've seen
[02:15.600 --> 02:22.400]  that in contracts before where it's public then they classify it again but super creepy
[02:23.280 --> 02:28.880]  and I did notice though I didn't say I stayed biggest thing ever and all this the comments
[02:28.880 --> 02:34.800]  there's like 400 of them there I've scanned through them the comments are almost universally saying
[02:34.800 --> 02:40.000]  whoa this is big especially veterans current military folks in afghanistan going this blue
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.760]  force red force all these designations transponders this is what we do with the enemy and I remember
[02:45.760 --> 02:52.880]  being an urban warfare drills in temple texas in oakland california and other areas and footage
[02:52.880 --> 02:56.960]  sent us by listeners all over the nation the marines when they practice taking over a town
[02:56.960 --> 03:02.720]  the mayor the police chief the the boy scouts in some cases are wearing transponders they're running
[03:02.720 --> 03:07.200]  around tattling spying on the militias and gun owners and all these drills now it's just admitted
[03:07.200 --> 03:11.760]  that we're the enemy real americans are the enemy the globals have a problem though because the
[03:11.760 --> 03:19.840]  military is awake and understand what's happening more and more of them so it's just off the charts
[03:19.840 --> 03:26.800]  that everybody who doesn't have a transponder badge terrorist for the drones going back even
[03:26.800 --> 03:33.360]  12 years ago this is in police state 2000 I have then all the raw footage I got it you know what
[03:33.360 --> 03:38.400]  I've got to dig into that bend before all those vhs tapes go back as I shot that on vhs before
[03:38.400 --> 03:44.480]  I even got the money to buy a digital camera a dvcam for like $5,000 I had to save my money
[03:44.480 --> 03:50.960]  and couldn't even buy that then but I was shooting it on vhs a used camera I bought for like a hundred
[03:50.960 --> 03:59.120]  dollars that's how much money I had even like a 98 99 and I've got all the raw footage of them
[03:59.120 --> 04:04.960]  giving us a tour and they've got this humvee with this big robot 50 cal gun on top of it maybe been
[04:04.960 --> 04:09.440]  above 50 cal we've got to pull the video up and they're talking about yeah we can target the
[04:09.440 --> 04:16.000]  insurgents with this and then it just designates those that don't have a transponder we hit the
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.600]  button we can even go get in a dugout or whatever and the humvee sits there just killing everybody
[04:22.560 --> 04:27.280]  and then I'm like well what about robots you've got and they're like well we're not going to get
[04:27.280 --> 04:32.160]  into the Swords which the public was just showing the last six years but we even have even better
[04:32.160 --> 04:37.040]  stuff but that's classified and boy I've talked the troops boy do they I mean they got stuff right
[04:37.040 --> 04:44.000]  out of Terminator back worse I mean we're in so much trouble and the globalists are getting to
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.320]  the point where they don't even need the troops anymore it's going to be shelf aware robots and
[04:48.320 --> 04:52.160]  drones and that's in the washington post they're already testing them they're already drones in
[04:52.160 --> 04:56.240]  the air that make the decision on who to kill stay with us

[08:12.560 --> 08:19.280]  i beg you to write down what we're gonna cover the basic points and then go research it for
[08:19.280 --> 08:26.560]  yourself because information of this incredible import of this magnitude
[08:29.680 --> 08:36.320]  is so important i have said ron paul has said uh other constitutional scholars like bruce fine
[08:36.320 --> 08:43.120]  have said uh mr turley uh constitutional scholar has said countless others have looked at this
[08:43.120 --> 08:50.000]  legislation that has passed the house and senate that obama says he'll sign but hasn't yet
[08:51.520 --> 08:57.120]  it's like the calm before the storm he's uh hesitating dropping the sword of damocles
[08:58.400 --> 09:02.480]  and escalating this into a whole new level and i think that's because there's a lot of behind the
[09:02.480 --> 09:06.560]  scenes jockeying in the power structure do they really want to give the president because that's
[09:06.560 --> 09:14.640]  what this says absolute power of kim jong il it says the president can kill any u.s citizen they want
[09:15.840 --> 09:19.920]  in fact i meant to play that turley clip from c span last night on the nightly news the guys
[09:19.920 --> 09:24.400]  got it ready but we never played it you guys go ask dude to give you the turley clip to play later
[09:24.400 --> 09:33.520]  in the hour you'll you'll know the one it is um i mean this is on record kill any u.s citizen in
[09:33.520 --> 09:39.680]  the u.s or anywhere else anytime they want no judge no jerry no discussion no need of proof
[09:39.680 --> 09:46.720]  no one above the president absolute dictator now bush signed executive orders and congress went
[09:46.720 --> 09:55.120]  along with it uh for pdd 51 and the accompanying um other uh numbers to other federal agencies
[09:55.120 --> 10:00.160]  because they had executive orders and presidential decision directives the pdd is 51 there's an
[10:00.160 --> 10:06.960]  executive order that accompanies it saying that for any crises including economic or unnamed
[10:06.960 --> 10:15.280]  crises the president can suspend congress and run the entire us government
[10:19.280 --> 10:26.000]  so the presidency though the presidency is a puppet position by the special interest the
[10:26.000 --> 10:33.840]  big megabanks goldman sacks jp morgan a handful of others the system is hesitating on this because
[10:33.840 --> 10:40.880]  i think even the global controllers are saying should we actually give a president this much
[10:40.880 --> 10:45.280]  power we already control them the congress already does whatever we say and are a bunch of tyrants
[10:45.280 --> 10:51.360]  we've got dirt on all these people do we want to because see they've actually worked too weak in
[10:51.360 --> 10:56.880]  the office of the presidency in the public mind while strengthening the power that the
[10:56.880 --> 11:02.640]  unelected bureaucracy has under the executive that's what nixon was all about certainly not a good
[11:02.640 --> 11:08.800]  guy but he was not a total globalist and uh he was not going along with a lot of their operations
[11:08.800 --> 11:13.040]  and it's come out we've interviewed the people that have gotten the documents is even in a lot of
[11:13.040 --> 11:18.880]  mainstream reports that they decided to go ahead and leak stuff on him from the plumbers
[11:18.880 --> 11:23.120]  and the break in at the watergate to bring him down and that's why you saw that happen
[11:23.120 --> 11:27.680]  because the power structure wanted to bring down richard nixon and weaken the presidency
[11:27.680 --> 11:30.960]  bill clinton was put in there to drag the presidency through the mud
[11:32.800 --> 11:40.800]  so they want the power of a dictatorship but they want it through the oligarchy the uh the the
[11:40.800 --> 11:48.800]  the the the plutocratic councils and combines to give the president this power
[11:50.960 --> 11:57.280]  and and then this is not rhetoric it is supreme dictator status even kings of old who said that
[11:57.280 --> 12:03.600]  they had their power as the divine right of blood and the whole french norman line believe they
[12:03.600 --> 12:08.800]  were descendant of christ from mary magdalene that's the whole marathindian line the queen of england
[12:08.800 --> 12:17.760]  that was was sworn in christened coronated on the the the the stone of abraham and believes
[12:17.760 --> 12:23.360]  that she is of the blood of christ and all this stuff these people think they're god even they had
[12:23.360 --> 12:30.320]  to issue some kangaroo reasons for why they were going to execute you or put you in the tower and
[12:30.320 --> 12:36.240]  sign an order this says the president need not even tell anyone and can do whatever they want
[12:36.240 --> 12:42.720]  and not even have proof of anything it is it is it is absolute dictatorship
[12:45.440 --> 12:51.920]  it's kim jong-il uh level and so obama said he was going to sign it last thursday and then last
[12:51.920 --> 12:58.480]  friday and then suddenly there were news articles obama set to sign uh india eight
[12:58.480 --> 13:02.080]  you know today and then it was tomorrow and then now people are saying well what's your statement
[13:02.080 --> 13:07.040]  are you going to sign it because obama had said he wasn't going to sign it but then his lawyers
[13:07.040 --> 13:11.280]  are like because we don't need to have this side he already has this power we'll kill us
[13:11.280 --> 13:16.320]  citizens whatever we want you saw those announcements we'll arrest whoever we want we'll spy on whoever
[13:16.320 --> 13:27.120]  we want we'll do whatever we want so we saw all of that unfolding and then we learned oh obama
[13:27.120 --> 13:34.960]  demanded the provision to arrest kill do whatever he wants torture us citizens and so now something's
[13:34.960 --> 13:39.440]  going on here and we'll continue uh to watch it very very closely
[13:42.000 --> 13:48.480]  now separately integrating in with all of this you've got newsweek with the headline
[13:48.480 --> 13:54.720]  governments local governments armed by homeland security to wage war remember that headline
[13:54.720 --> 13:59.840]  yesterday preparing for war i've got three other articles today we're local governments
[13:59.840 --> 14:07.840]  with tanks wheel vehicles machine guns uh combat robots uh training for war and by the way we've
[14:07.840 --> 14:15.600]  gotten the manuals al qaeda hidden in the manual okay it's john deere cap wearing overall wearing
[14:15.600 --> 14:21.600]  rednecks good old boys people that could skin a buck run a trot line you see the drones already
[14:21.600 --> 14:29.120]  targeting you know people that quote are living on 3000 acre farm compounds with their families
[14:29.120 --> 14:35.040]  and who quote want to be left alone and quote aren't paying their property tax see nobody's
[14:35.040 --> 14:38.720]  going to be able to pay their property tax except the one tenth of one percent when they're done
[14:38.720 --> 14:43.520]  with this global depression they're going to come take everything and a lot of people are
[14:43.520 --> 14:48.480]  going to say i'm going to sit here on my farm it's paid off the property taxes unconstitutional
[14:48.480 --> 14:53.600]  hadn't been around but the last 60 years i'm not going to pay it and they're going to send
[14:54.640 --> 15:00.640]  military in to kill you i've been to the urban drills i've shot video they practice killing
[15:00.640 --> 15:07.440]  farmers that's who they practice to have war with under the new rural council don't look it up on
[15:07.440 --> 15:12.400]  the whitehouse dot gov who is at the head of the rural council the department of defense and homeland
[15:12.400 --> 15:20.400]  security and you talk about creepy i mean deploying plainclothes military as liaisons creeping around
[15:20.400 --> 15:27.760]  your small town now there's a good side effect of this the military is completely freaking out right
[15:27.760 --> 15:33.360]  now and saying alex jones is a hundred percent right we apologize you were always right they're
[15:33.360 --> 15:37.600]  apologizing to all the other members that told them this year's ago they are all getting right
[15:37.600 --> 15:43.200]  behind ron paul they're all getting chills right now i mean this is treason this is foreign banks
[15:43.200 --> 15:47.440]  that have taken over europe and the us in europe they're saying we're going to send in paramilitary
[15:47.440 --> 15:54.880]  tax collectors in portugal in spain in ireland in greece and they're saying on top of all your
[15:54.880 --> 15:59.920]  other taxes over 70 percent on average in greece and taxes we're now putting a new 20 percent vat
[15:59.920 --> 16:06.400]  on all your restaurants and other tourism spots and europeans aren't even i've got articles today
[16:06.400 --> 16:13.200]  aren't even buying new electronics they're going into a depression the tourism's dying
[16:13.920 --> 16:18.800]  and and the greece and others are saying we're not going to pay it and so the eu says then we're
[16:18.800 --> 16:25.840]  going to come and arrest you they're like we can't pay and they're like that's the plan jack you think
[16:25.840 --> 16:32.480]  when california passed this year a 20 plus percent carbon tax on all their major industries
[16:32.480 --> 16:40.080]  that they didn't know that would send california into cardiac arrest this is by design
[16:41.760 --> 16:47.440]  you think when king john and robin hoots time that's a true story did you know that that that
[16:47.440 --> 16:51.600]  when he was bankrupting everybody and driving the villagers into the woods starving to death
[16:54.160 --> 17:01.280]  that he was an idiot no he wasn't an idiot he was going into sacks and areas that he'd never
[17:01.280 --> 17:07.280]  totally broken and trying to completely drive them into revolt so he had a reason to kill them
[17:07.280 --> 17:12.880]  and remove the sacks and lords that he thought weren't completely loyal to him it's called a
[17:12.880 --> 17:17.680]  scorched earth policy and i'm not going to sit here and get off and do an entire story here
[17:18.400 --> 17:23.840]  but they were norman who'd come into the south and they were still engaged in a cold war against
[17:23.840 --> 17:32.320]  sacks and who they hadn't completely routed out of the entire imperium or kingdom but again i digress
[17:33.680 --> 17:39.680]  now here's the big news that ties into all of this while the military and the police
[17:40.240 --> 17:44.640]  and sadly the police they can find the types in many cases that get off on this and buy it
[17:44.640 --> 17:48.960]  of the propaganda that's it the police are you got to worry about and a lot of them are waking up to
[17:48.960 --> 17:54.000]  but i like the military uh they've been taught a disdain for the public and the rest of it many of
[17:54.000 --> 18:00.560]  them are are training for all out war against the population and that's now all over mainstream news
[18:00.560 --> 18:04.640]  because they've got to get ready to let you know they they're not going to hide this anymore
[18:04.640 --> 18:08.160]  they're not going to hide the world government they're going to sell it though a private banking
[18:08.160 --> 18:11.920]  world government as what's going to get food back on your table of course you'll just make
[18:11.920 --> 18:18.720]  things worse it's designed to it's a post industrial model the deeper you get your arm into this thing
[18:18.720 --> 18:22.160]  and they tell you well just stick your arm in a little bit deeper that'll fix it the more you
[18:22.160 --> 18:27.280]  can't get out of it you understand that it's called a trap the globalists are in control because they
[18:27.280 --> 18:32.000]  don't want to make things nice because they don't play by rules because they want to wreck everything
[18:32.000 --> 18:38.320]  so they're on top of it what a big major corporate raiders do you know in movies they're based on
[18:38.320 --> 18:44.400]  a composite of true stories like wall street with charlie sheen and michael douglas you know great
[18:44.400 --> 18:52.240]  movie it's based on composites of of real people and in that if they go into like a five billion

[25:04.400 --> 25:12.240]  psychotronic brainwashing chemical system you can imagine and so i want to apologize here on air
[25:12.240 --> 25:18.400]  that i've called people that are dumbed down and that laugh at us idiots and zombies they are
[25:18.400 --> 25:24.640]  brainwashed victims and some of them are irreplicably damaged to a point of no return
[25:24.640 --> 25:28.800]  and we should say a prayer for them and i mean that we should say a prayer for people
[25:29.440 --> 25:35.040]  that have been overrun by this system that the psychological warfare chiefs the scientific
[25:35.040 --> 25:41.280]  dictators have established and it's up to us that have persevered through this and have been
[25:41.280 --> 25:50.240]  somewhat immune or more resistant it is up to us the strong to protect the weak from these bullies
[25:50.880 --> 25:58.480]  that have a global scorched earth eugenics policy facing our society now coming up in the next
[25:58.480 --> 26:06.400]  segment i'm going to get to this article from c-span the second most cited law professor in the country
[26:06.400 --> 26:15.680]  jonathan turley talks about the fact that this does allow the killing of u.s citizen secret
[26:15.680 --> 26:18.880]  torture and arrest that's actually what's in the bill you can go read it yourself but
[26:19.440 --> 26:24.000]  point is ron paul's telling you this i'm telling you this other scholars are telling you this go
[26:24.000 --> 26:29.280]  read the bill and ron paul i saw a clip up at info wars dot com last time i was at a town hall in
[26:29.280 --> 26:34.480]  iowa and he said i'm tired of congress lying to the american people and the media and telling you
[26:34.480 --> 26:41.280]  the ndaa doesn't doesn't affect you it does here's the subsection but then when they're late night
[26:41.280 --> 26:47.280]  debating it the the authors of the bill get up and say yeah it affects citizens president kill
[26:47.280 --> 26:52.880]  anybody who wants we want you to be scared of that and scared of torture i played the clips on the
[26:52.880 --> 27:00.240]  nightly news i posted them i mean it's so creepy to watch these weird evil old men you know a friendly
[27:00.240 --> 27:07.520]  old man like a hoppy hodlberg it's so nice and good they put off an aura of wisdom and
[27:07.520 --> 27:15.520]  friendliness and goodness but an evil old man there's nothing nastier than a wicked demonic
[27:15.520 --> 27:21.280]  old man where the evil just piles up on him like in a christmas carol where the you know the chains
[27:21.280 --> 27:27.440]  of greed are just wrapped so tightly around scrooge's old partner when he sees his ghost he says
[27:27.440 --> 27:35.760]  scrooge beware your chains are twice this length and weight you think greed greed and having you
[27:35.760 --> 27:41.680]  know some of the starving kids of your employees dying put spiritual chains on you how about
[27:41.680 --> 27:48.800]  consciously putting sodium fluoride and radioactive isotopes in 72 percent of us water supplies
[27:48.800 --> 27:54.640]  on record you're a new listener and you're like what just type in governor perry covered up radio
[27:54.640 --> 28:00.320]  radioactive isotopes in texas water you know why that cover up happened because i talked about it
[28:00.320 --> 28:05.280]  the last few years state employees finally heard the show leaked it and said yeah we're told to
[28:05.280 --> 28:10.240]  cover up the test it's in the fluoride and then the media spun it we don't know why it's in the
[28:10.240 --> 28:15.440]  water but the state did cover it up because the feds told them to move along i'm going to say it
[28:15.440 --> 28:22.000]  again to cops listing and military the criminal eugenicist crazy scientist who think we're a cancer
[28:22.000 --> 28:27.840]  and want to get rid of us and who get off on plan with us like lab rats my dad said in high school
[28:27.840 --> 28:32.160]  when he two summers worked at md anderson most of the research scientists were really nice really
[28:32.160 --> 28:36.880]  good people but he said sometimes when they were doing experiments on people that had signed over
[28:36.880 --> 28:41.200]  because they were dying of cancer and missing their lower mandibles and just horror my dad said you
[28:41.200 --> 28:47.360]  couldn't believe then he worked there also in college under africa the guy's name some top chinese
[28:47.360 --> 28:53.520]  cancer scientist and uh he said you know just whole wards of people at md anderson
[28:54.240 --> 28:58.400]  top cancer research facility missing their lower mandibles missing part of their head
[28:58.400 --> 29:03.520]  you know kids in their animals they said some of those scientists got off on the pain and they'd
[29:03.520 --> 29:07.760]  be injecting somebody with something that was really painful they'd be like just getting off on
[29:07.760 --> 29:13.040]  it or people be injecting lab rats and getting off on them dying and my dad was like oh what is this
[29:13.040 --> 29:17.920]  in research science out of man i'll interview my dad sometime well it'd be an interesting interview
[29:17.920 --> 29:23.520]  these two self-deprecating to get on air the point is that's what we're facing
[29:25.520 --> 29:31.760]  that's what we're dealing with is people who just it's like when eric piyanka's graduates
[29:31.760 --> 29:35.440]  some of them that are medical doctors sent me threatening emails when i exposed the ut guy
[29:35.440 --> 29:42.080]  calling for mass death and 90 percent that made national news um you know his his his graduates
[29:42.080 --> 29:46.000]  sent me stuff and said you know we're gonna kill everybody and then i went and looked them up
[29:46.000 --> 29:52.400]  there they were in white lab coats at bio weapon facilities we're on the march the empires on the

[38:40.880 --> 38:50.400]  air this is this is the pit demons that run our government the absolute total demons of hell
[38:50.400 --> 38:56.720]  hell and they want to drop the hammer first before they start arresting people and doing it to us
[38:56.720 --> 39:01.920]  and i got news for the system you're getting rid of the rule on everything else i don't
[39:01.920 --> 39:06.480]  it's just all a complete fraud the whole thing's illegitimate and i know the average cops a good
[39:06.480 --> 39:10.880]  guy the average military doesn't matter i'm sure there were nice cops in nazi germany
[39:10.880 --> 39:17.680]  and nice military you work for a hijacked government i've explained this before if you were
[39:17.680 --> 39:24.000]  gone on a city bus and a guy ran into the bus with a machine gun and and and and and dynamite
[39:24.000 --> 39:31.120]  around their chest and said i'm taking over and he pistol whipped the driver and put on the driver's
[39:31.120 --> 39:36.640]  uniform would you just immediately do whatever he said study show he pulled this up with stock
[39:36.640 --> 39:42.880]  home syndrome been around forever but they just named it that about what is it 45 percent will
[39:42.880 --> 39:51.040]  totally submit and love the guy with the dynamite tied to him see i'm the bad man i don't like the
[39:51.040 --> 39:56.320]  guy because he's wearing the bus driver cap with the dynamite strap doing i'm like hey you're not
[39:56.320 --> 40:03.760]  the bus driver pal you're a treasonous usurper and they're like i'll like the dynamite and at a
[40:03.760 --> 40:09.840]  certain point you've got to just deal with it you can't just keep giving into these terrorists
[40:09.840 --> 40:14.080]  who terrorize us with the terrorism i mean let's say you believe the terrorism is all real
[40:14.080 --> 40:17.680]  and you ignore the fact that al-qaeda was created by the criminals that run our government and is
[40:17.680 --> 40:22.240]  being given control of all these countries right now and all the rest of this let's just
[40:22.800 --> 40:27.280]  say okay it's all real okay we're going to do a piece actually tonight where you've got a better
[40:27.280 --> 40:32.480]  chance we've got the statistics from the justice department uh from world almanac and others
[40:32.480 --> 40:37.760]  you got a better chance of a vending machine falling over on you than being killed by terrorist
[40:37.760 --> 40:41.920]  you've got a better chance of being struck by lightning i mean you know the statistics we're
[40:41.920 --> 40:46.240]  going to show a whole bunch of them tonight got a better chance of being eaten by an american
[40:46.240 --> 40:54.160]  alligator which is very rare so but it's not rare to be killed by an elephant or hippopotamus if
[40:54.160 --> 40:58.480]  you live in africa uh we're gonna get into those numbers uh much better chance to die from a rattlesnake
[40:58.480 --> 41:03.760]  bite here in the u.s than being killed by terrorists so there's the whole hoax of our whole society
[41:03.760 --> 41:08.720]  changes and the police are dressed in black uniforms and there's checkpoints being set up
[41:08.720 --> 41:14.160]  and they're groping our wives and daughters and children because of terrorism and then in every
[41:14.160 --> 41:19.200]  case you find out the government opens the door for the patsy lunatics that they use to attack us
[41:19.200 --> 41:23.520]  and it's back in the news today where the criminals that run our government are funding terrorist
[41:24.320 --> 41:30.480]  so at a primitive level people look different than us different culture and there's all these
[41:30.480 --> 41:35.840]  shows in south park and team america and it's fun to get into fear of the muslims and okay well
[41:35.840 --> 41:40.960]  then why is the government bringing them in in record numbers i mean if they're just all absolute
[41:40.960 --> 41:50.000]  devils who want to slit our throats okay uh let's expand on that if that's the case then i mean how
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.920]  do you square up and we're all a locky number three in al-qaeda meeting secretly at the pentagon
[41:53.920 --> 42:00.640]  how do you square up the head of the seven seven bombers on record being mi6 fox news one in telegraph
[42:00.640 --> 42:06.640]  former fbi top chief what loftus exposing that they're not all terrorists at the fbi
[42:08.400 --> 42:12.320]  that mr german from the fbi going public years ago saying they're getting ready for martial law
[42:12.960 --> 42:19.280]  inventora's martial law piece that's why the the show was banned because the show was 99 percent
[42:19.280 --> 42:25.680]  on target it was bullseye baby you got the bullseye right in the middle of the dart board it was
[42:26.480 --> 42:31.440]  90 into the red barely touching the next ring that show was so on target
[42:34.720 --> 42:38.160]  and they're like that's not airing again this is a complete blueprint for what we're doing
[42:38.880 --> 42:42.640]  i mean it's not like we don't know the fema camp plan we have the congressional hearings
[42:42.640 --> 42:46.640]  we have the wall street journal we have the purchase orders we have all this but you notice
[42:46.640 --> 42:51.840]  when they put out bids for fema camps in 2006 for civil emergency and catastrophic attacks and
[42:51.840 --> 42:56.320]  civil disorder that at least the wall street journal said oh look here's giant bids to build
[42:56.320 --> 43:02.800]  fema camps now that they got department of defense under rural affairs running it designating government
[43:02.800 --> 43:08.880]  employees is blue u.s citizens is red in the same designation as iraq and afghanistan
[43:08.880 --> 43:16.000]  where they're wearing transponders and they're they talk and they talk about you know deploying
[43:16.000 --> 43:22.080]  forces barricades you know delivering uh i mean it's all for the drones gps your front door
[43:24.960 --> 43:30.880]  even i can't believe this to to actually see it happening and to see them now
[43:31.680 --> 43:35.920]  flipping the power switches on it's it's it's one thing to have a gun in the gun case
[43:35.920 --> 43:41.520]  but now they've gone to the combination they've opened it they've gotten the m14 out they've taken
[43:41.520 --> 43:47.440]  a loaded cartridge and they've jammed it in and they're now loading around in chambering around
[43:47.440 --> 43:52.560]  and now they're pointing it at us and the documents say they're going to pull the trigger because
[43:52.560 --> 43:58.480]  they've designed the implosion and in the implosion the police the military everybody who
[43:58.480 --> 44:04.240]  goes along with this you destroy yourself as well it's not like you're having martial law because
[44:04.240 --> 44:10.400]  a nuke went off from real terrorist or a meteor hit us or or there was a giant you know 10.5
[44:10.400 --> 44:15.040]  earthquakes all over the u.s or something and then there's looting and whatever and the troops
[44:15.040 --> 44:21.520]  have got to be called out this isn't some legitimate contingency plan this is a controlled demolition
[44:21.520 --> 44:28.960]  on record for a post industrial america by by criminal terrorist banking oligarchs who publicly
[44:28.960 --> 44:37.040]  created the 1.5 quadrillion that had our treasonous government sign on to it this is bondage this is
[44:37.040 --> 44:45.520]  economic conquest with a paramilitary backup behind it now we're 44 minutes into this transmission
[44:46.160 --> 44:52.240]  and i'm going to open the phones up for the entire second hour ahead of don browning one of the cops
[44:52.240 --> 44:57.840]  they haven't killed yet who has the courage to come on he's a retired Oklahoma City police officer
[44:57.840 --> 45:02.640]  u.s marine and vietnam veteran don worked with a canine unit was part of the search and rescue
[45:02.640 --> 45:07.760]  team at the murrow building after the bombing and they've talked to a bunch of cops off record
[45:07.760 --> 45:13.520]  and department defense bomb disposal people but a lot of moron record in this film including the
[45:13.520 --> 45:16.800]  inventor of the neutron bomb the former head of air force weapons development others saying there
[45:16.800 --> 45:20.240]  were bombs in the building we have newscasts where they're removing them before they got their
[45:20.240 --> 45:23.760]  talking point straight and they went to these cops and others and they said we know where your
[45:23.760 --> 45:28.560]  daughter goes to school we know where your son goes we're going to kill him imagine being a cop
[45:28.560 --> 45:31.600]  or a department defense bomb disposal you're like these are bombs in here and they're like
[45:32.560 --> 45:37.040]  your daughter jenny who goes to school here you want us to kill her we got a file on you i mean i
[45:37.040 --> 45:42.640]  don't know what i mean somebody's trying to kill my kids right there i mean i'm not mr tough guy
[45:42.640 --> 45:50.320]  folks but let me tell you something i mean you just this is what i mean imagine being a cop
[45:50.320 --> 45:56.720]  and the guy is threatening you or threatening your family this is who runs america and there's
[45:56.720 --> 46:03.520]  not that many of them the criminals at the top always give us a ledger a story a fable to follow
[46:03.520 --> 46:08.080]  what they're saying and doing but if you ever look at it from just another angle you find out oh i'm
[46:08.080 --> 46:12.160]  not doing this because of the reason they say i'm compartmentalized i'm doing it because these are
[46:12.160 --> 46:20.080]  a bunch of knuckle dragon crooks i talked to a lot of some top financial experts off the record
[46:20.080 --> 46:23.760]  yesterday i may be able to get the guy on the sunday i'm going to be on christmas new show christmas
[46:23.760 --> 46:29.760]  premiere and uh because these are times we got to get the information out and
[46:34.080 --> 46:38.320]  the word is in dc and new york core sign is going to be allowed to keep the money
[46:38.320 --> 46:42.480]  in the london backer counts he's put it in and this is the new precedent where they're just
[46:42.480 --> 46:46.320]  going to take everything publicly and not get in trouble so our worst fears are being confirmed
[46:46.320 --> 46:50.960]  there i mean do you want to live in a world like that where you got some little dwarf demonic pig
[46:50.960 --> 46:57.600]  face person little soft chicken neck not living in reality kim jong il running your life because
[46:57.600 --> 47:02.480]  given in the government that's what it does how did the north korean set up the greatest police
[47:02.480 --> 47:08.240]  state dehumanization grid in human history how did the north koreans do that they had been at the
[47:08.240 --> 47:13.280]  end of world war two already starving then the communists chinese and russians backed them
[47:13.840 --> 47:20.400]  there was a huge war which hundreds and hundreds of thousands died on both sides and things were so
[47:20.400 --> 47:25.520]  destroyed that they were able to set up a total control grid from the very beginning that's why
[47:25.520 --> 47:30.960]  the globalists want to destroy everything economically here because it's about total control
[47:30.960 --> 47:38.720]  so the only way out you think it's fun risking my life and believe me i am and i wouldn't be
[47:38.720 --> 47:43.920]  everyone for your prayers do you think it's fun risking my family no it's not but there is no future
[47:45.920 --> 47:51.040]  there is no future for anybody if we don't beat the scientific dictatorship they are the worst of
[47:51.040 --> 47:56.960]  the worst and there's no utopia a lot of people say oh what are you going to do the world's always
[47:56.960 --> 48:03.360]  been bad no it hadn't always been like this there have been a lot of elites who were in control
[48:03.360 --> 48:07.600]  but actually wanted to build up society and educate people those have been called golden ages
[48:08.160 --> 48:15.760]  in different societies this is people that want a dark age a technocratic nightmare dark age
[48:15.760 --> 48:20.160]  where they enjoy all the high tech systems and then we those of us who are allowed to live
[48:20.160 --> 48:27.680]  live in post industrial squalor for their power tripping enjoyment and i believe in humanity
[48:27.680 --> 48:34.240]  i believe in life and so i've got to not even bet myself and my family and my treasure and
[48:34.240 --> 48:40.560]  my sacred honor it's not my betting i have to make the decision to be on the side of good
[48:40.560 --> 48:46.400]  for my soul you can call it your psyche who you are what what you stand for if you don't believe
[48:46.400 --> 48:53.920]  in spiritual issues the point is that the decision is the most important thing it's about what's in
[48:53.920 --> 49:01.920]  here okay it's about what's in here and i have to be an example to others i i have to face the
[49:01.920 --> 49:08.400]  threats and the things that go on and move forward just like ron paul does because it is in that
[49:08.400 --> 49:15.440]  service to humanity that we build on society and make things better there were countless people
[49:15.440 --> 49:20.480]  who we don't even know their names of every color and creed before us who gave everything they had
[49:21.200 --> 49:29.360]  for human dignity and we are the brothers and sisters of those people in eternity the value
[49:29.360 --> 49:39.120]  of that to my soul is the greatest gift and the ultimate treasure to be with the good to stand
[49:39.120 --> 49:47.200]  with the light to stand in goodness in a wicked world where they tell you there is no good or
[49:47.200 --> 49:52.560]  evil that is the greatest lie to say there isn't good and evil to say there isn't that choice in
[49:52.560 --> 50:01.120]  free will all right i'll look i've talked for 50 minutes i want to give the number out and i want
[50:01.120 --> 50:06.720]  to get to our top story i've mentioned it some and i'd hope it's not pearls before swine because

[56:13.680 --> 56:18.160]  already had it saved and we have that original one then they just totally pulled it and put it up saying
[56:18.160 --> 56:22.480]  department of defense employees should not be posting classified things on here
[56:26.240 --> 56:33.040]  implying that that was classified the point is folks this is where they talk about the government

[01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:01.920]  been listening to you for years and it's just shocked to see everything taking place as the way
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:07.280]  you said it you know and i remember seeing you years ago when you were in new york and then i
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:13.280]  you know then i started doing research on you i've seen everything you said has come to pass now
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:18.160]  as he's as they said the chicken is coming home the roost and it's like the the public is just
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:24.000]  grained at you know i try to talk to my co-workers you know some of them listen and some of them don't
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.960]  and it's just sad as you know state that we're heading here in this nation well i tell you new
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:37.200]  york city is going to be a scary place to be in a total collapse well you know what i'll tell you
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:43.040]  this alec some of my co-workers kind of know something is going on and a lot of them are getting
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:48.480]  their guns and food you know ready for what's going to go on you know and i've been doing that already
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:56.640]  you know so i want to be surprised if it looks like new orders here i hope not um i mean the
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:02.080]  colleagues that are waking up what are they saying oh well you know what they feel that
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:07.040]  something is not right you know as far as like the way the economy just everything is going on but
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:12.400]  they just can't you know put two and two together that everything is you know being we're being
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:18.720]  directed like you said it to this planned implosion you know so they just they just can't put their
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:23.280]  their head on it as far as like what's going on you know but like i said you know i've tried to
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:28.400]  put them on to you i've tried to put them on so i'll turn the media and some of them are waking up
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:33.040]  well god bless them then that's good because i would not want the job the police are going to
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:38.400]  have in this situation again there's a good chance because we got the jump on the globalist
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:43.120]  that a lot of this isn't going to go the way they want the problem is it's like a big war machine
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:48.640]  a juggernaut a big engine they've turned it loose and i don't think they can even stop it now so
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:54.480]  it is going to be a very interesting town to be alive they're going to i got news here where
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:59.360]  they're saying they're going to hit iran soon that obama's behind it the israeli press is saying that
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:04.800]  and you know the globalist aren't just going to try to take over domestically without launching a war
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:09.200]  because they know that people at a primitive level tend to rally around the government even
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:14.320]  if it's run by criminals i mean look what happened in germany i mean hitler wasn't very popular
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:20.400]  the last four or five years but he had him in a big war and so 20 million germans died i mean
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:25.760]  they were only 60 something million think of that think of what following orders got them into
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:33.520]  exactly alex and i've been telling my quote uh but just telling people in general just about
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:38.560]  you know we need to make sure that this war does not happen you know or else this is going to lead
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:42.880]  to world war three that's the last thing we need and that's why i'm telling everybody to vote for

[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:32.800]  uh freeman matt mike perry and others you're coming up a lot of times when i open the phones
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:37.520]  up for police and military an active duty are currently serving i say you know i want to hear
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:42.000]  what you think about this legislation to arrest citizens we've covered in last month and let the
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:48.320]  military engage in domestic operations and even kill citizens outside of law or charges and normally
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:53.520]  the phones load up we got one police officer from new york city to call in he was almost the last
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:59.040]  segment of you just joined us and um he said some of the other peace officers are waking up they are
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:05.200]  know that a big collapse is obviously a serious uh probability now uh from being a
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:10.720]  possibility to a probability unfortunately we're in a depression undoubtedly just it's just
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:16.480]  incrementally getting worse uh but uh if you just joined us we also have been talking about
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:24.640]  this new document that was pointed out to us on the federal bid website you know dot gov site
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:31.200]  saying you know military around the camps to take over all of society to take over local government
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.000]  government will wear transponders that they're blue friendlies everyone else is an enemy
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.960]  and i had the department of defense whistleblower on who pointed it out to us now an hour after we
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:48.800]  linked to it it was pulled when i mentioned it on air they started changing it and removing
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:53.200]  stuff we'd already saved it but a lot of the key stuff was still there then they just pulled it and
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:57.760]  said uh you know department of defense employees are not supposed to remember do not post classified
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:03.040]  material implying it was classified but we have it saved up at info wars dot com and there's
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:09.360]  uh other files of it online as well uh and we also got put it up on a flicker account images
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:14.960]  of it uh but um it's all there and we've also found some other versions of it people save so
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:19.680]  we're going to link to those i meant to tell her to do that uh but going back uh ronaldo wanted to
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:24.560]  bring up the ron paul thing and i was going to get to that later they're bringing up newsletters
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:30.080]  and this is a controversy since he ran for congress he was in one term back in the eighties
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:36.080]  lost because he's a libertarian member then he got in as a republican in what 96 i supported him
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:42.160]  i mean i interviewed him when he was campaigning in 96 and so i've been interviewing ron paul for
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:46.400]  almost 17 years because his district used to come right up into austin but i'm gonna go to our
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:52.000]  guest he wanted to our guest caller i wanted to uh just just just point this out i'm not an
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:59.280]  apologist for anybody ron paul put back then newsletters were the hottest thing in the world
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:05.680]  they're still hot but political newsletters were churned out and at one time in like not by 92 he
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:14.800]  had 14 newsletters under his name and i remember learning later why he fired some people and no
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:20.080]  one knew this and i probably shouldn't talk about it he ended up firing a whole group of people that
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:24.480]  worked for him because of it before it was ever an issue when he was first in congress in the eighties
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:29.440]  this is on record you go look it up he voted for the martin luther king day the only time he voted
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:32.960]  for something that's unconstitutional he's on record because you know it is unconstitutional
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:37.280]  just to have quote days for a person that's not in the constitution but he did it and he said that's
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:41.520]  the one time because he admires him for standing up for what he believed in and fighting corruption
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:45.760]  and and you know power of liberty that's what ron paul's into he's always been you can pull him up
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:50.800]  on morton downey jr in the eighties talking about stuff like this and and aids being manufactured
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:57.280]  to kill black people somebody who wants to be racist towards black people that doesn't want the hiv
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:01.680]  putting the you know in the vaccines to kill them and so yeah there's some stuff like yeah you know
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:05.920]  they'll stop you know black folks in la they'll stop rioting when the welfare check gets there
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:11.280]  well i mean that is what dependency does and i don't ron paul says he didn't write that particular
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:17.680]  one because it'd be like jonesreport.com and i've had a lot of articles written probably 95% of it
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:22.960]  i haven't written i mean you just pick through it 14 different newsletters simultaneously being
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:28.400]  published and one was a special supplement edition that on record he didn't write they go what about
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:35.440]  your names on it yeah at the top ron paul report so that's what goes on so ron paul fired people
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:41.280]  back whenever he you know noticed this it became an issue in in the mid nineties and it doesn't
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:48.160]  matter ron paul in speeches and and ron paul in events and ron paul working in inner city hospitals
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:55.200]  at cherry hospitals who ron paul is has always stood there and he doesn't want all these wars
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:03.520]  killing brown people everywhere so it is this this use of race that they always push to divide people
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:09.200]  and they brought this up against rand and so he wasn't a medical doctor kidnap women worshiped

[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:38.480]  overalls are a bunch of racists they got caught doing that the democrats did so you've got all
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:45.280]  these dirty tricks going on you know obama unfroze the money for africa for basically forced abortions
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:50.720]  where they tell the women you want to get a small payment have an abortion so see killing black babies
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:58.080]  isn't racist but out of thousands and thousands and thousands i mean if you've got newsletters
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:04.320]  published every week 14 of them at one time a lot of big franchise and ron paul said yeah the
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:10.640]  company with the 20 or so people was making millions a year you know profit or or or or gross
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:16.480]  not profit but but yeah it was a and i i apologize and it was immoral that i didn't have total control
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:23.120]  overall this is a full-time practicing obstetrician delivering babies and i and i i i let it get out of
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:27.600]  control and i apologize and so they only bring it back and bring it back because they first told
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:32.080]  you he couldn't win now they say he'll discredit the caucuses they're going to cheat him on the
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:36.160]  black box in new hampshire be ready for that but there's a strategy to beat it we got a special

[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:45.440]  officer in new york i wanted to preface it because i meant to get to that earlier uh go ahead and make
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:52.400]  your point sir well i wanted to i was listening to the um the neocons on radio last week and it
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:57.600]  was disgusting at how they were bringing up this point exactly about the newsletter you can see
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:02.960]  of how all of them had talking points you know they were you know they were demonizing so you
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:07.840]  know at the end of the day like you said you know he didn't have control over the newsletters
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:13.840]  and it was how come limbaugh can have a thing called obama the magic negro clearly racist
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:19.760]  and and it was okay though i mean that was airing three and a half years ago you know not some
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:23.760]  things saying yeah they're the blacks when they get their welfare check and it'll stop rioting
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:30.560]  and then somebody else wrote it i mean what's more uh obama the magic negro that that the neocons
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:36.480]  are doing or what ron paul didn't do exactly exactly you're right about that alex but thank
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:41.360]  you very much for the work that you're doing and um i'll try my best to you know keep spending
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:44.960]  information out well let me stop running because i cut into what you said because i get so excited
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:50.320]  ronaldo other points about ron paul you say you're talking to other police officers uh is any of this
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:54.960]  demonization of him working because paul's show he's only going up oh by the way i have an article
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:16:03.200]  right here seeing in paul ron paul most popular republican amongst non whites i mean is it rhetoric
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:08.080]  people want or do you want the brown people to stop getting smart bombed by the predator drones
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:15.840]  well you know what i keep i keep showing people's videos of ron paul like information on the internet
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:20.400]  and a lot of them are starting to believe in him because they you know they've seen that he's consistent
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:26.640]  unlike the other candidates who just straight out lie in your face like gang ridge um brownie
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:31.760]  and michelle balkman who wants war when you know she was never even a veteran you know but

[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:38.880]  information out there ronaldo let me just ask you one last question you say you've been awake for a
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:45.040]  while talking to other police officers are they starting to wake up yes some of them some of them
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:48.960]  are but you know at the end of the day you can't reach everybody and i move on and you know

[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:11.680]  okay uh let's uh let's get into some of this news so i get back to your calls before our next
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:18.080]  guest comes on here it is cnn poll ron poll most popular republican amongst non whites
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:21.120]  and they dug through thousands of newsletters
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:28.800]  to find a few things that are kind of flippant but for mainline republican stuff this is nothing
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:33.200]  i mean they they say terrible racist stuff all the time and that's just fine and dandy
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:38.240]  this is stuff like well when the blacks will stop rioting and south central when the welfare checks
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:43.760]  arrive and then paul decades ago said he didn't write that some some bad things you know that we're
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:48.720]  in the fbi files who knows if they're true about probably aren't martin luther king you know sex
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:56.560]  with you know people or whatever and that came out five years after paul had voted to put martin
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:01.680]  luther king day out there and had given speeches about how he admired martin luther king standing
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:07.840]  up against tyranny and paul reportedly got really mad and i know ron paul i know all the lore i know
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:12.480]  i've known his whole crew the different crews i know all the inside baseball i'll never talk
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:17.920]  but a lot of good people the point is ron paul is the real deal he doesn't sell out he doesn't
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:22.880]  he doesn't care what people think about him so if he didn't like martin luther king he would tell you
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:29.760]  you understand that so the point is it's all bull but they're using it because they're desperate
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:34.880]  they keep saying he can't win you're not listening to the mind control now he's looks like he's
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:40.560]  going to be in first in new hampshire and iowa he's come up second or first depending on which
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:46.000]  poll you see in nevada those articles are in infowars dot com it's meteoric and it shows how
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.400]  big the awakening is they keep saying in the news troops don't like him because he doesn't want to
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:55.280]  keep the wars going 70 plus percent of all presidential donations in both parties for
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:40:01.360]  obama and the other seven republicans go to him it's all hoaxes i'm not going to give it
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:04.480]  attention because it's what they want and i could definitely win a lawsuit against them
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:11.200]  but there is a dallas publication uh that i remember six months ago implied i was working
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:16.800]  for the communist chinese i mean it was bizarre and it's a mainline publication today they said
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:23.120]  well ron paul hangs out with the known racist who hates black people alex jones you know the hard
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:28.880]  core racist and i i saw that and i thought man i don't have time to sue this guy but i mean if i
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:35.440]  don't what next is he gonna say i'm you know i support the ndaa bill getting rid of bestiality
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:40.400]  or something and i'm in raping possums i mean it was it's that ridiculous but i looked at every
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:46.240]  comment you know i'm a i'm a military in afghanistan you can eat bleep you know alex jones is great and
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:51.440]  fights racism and blah blah blah stands up a little guy you scum i mean i didn't even have time to
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:55.920]  read the 50 something comments i just scanned through him everyone was going you're a yellow
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:01.600]  journalist trash you ought to get sued nobody buys you but i mean that's what they're resorting to
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:09.760]  alex jones works for the chinese government alex jones uh he hates black people i mean what what
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:18.480]  what i mean they are getting really desperate like that headline in cbs news alex jones you know
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:23.200]  ron paul likes alex jones and ron and alex jones says they put stuff in the water to make you gay
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:28.560]  i read the bbc and associated press about gender bending and men having higher estrogen and it
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:33.520]  changing their different glands in their bodies confusing sexual activity but also in every other
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:38.880]  mammal that is in the food chain now i mean that's just i was i was reading bbc but that's how they
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:44.880]  spin it i'm reading bbc on air you can type in right now gender bending chemicals into google
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:48.880]  changing men and women's physiology also covered breast cancer increasing but by the time they're
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:55.440]  done the big homophobe says you're gay because they put it near water i mean you know this is what
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:42:03.520]  they do this is how they attack science how they attack research oh i saw bloomberg cbs a bc just
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:11.120]  literally hundreds that i can't even have time to read all of them saying ron paul is is it's just
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:14.320]  terrible he went on alex jones's show and said there's a plan to use the military against the
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:19.200]  people in marshal law it's totally insane meanwhile across the political spectrum constitutional
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:24.320]  lawyers say this makes the government a dictatorship and allows them to kill citizens just absolute
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:29.840]  nightmare and they're and they're all over the news i mean you type alex jones ron paul in just
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:36.080]  to find these there's hundreds every day but then it's and i agree with the caller i mean it's it's
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:41.920]  kind of backfire on them but see they just want you to think ron paul's been destroyed when they
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:46.720]  start stealing the elections with the black boxes but you say well then why vote why because we're
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:51.440]  going to expose that and because ron paul running exposes them and if he gets such a big landslide
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:56.960]  like with ron paul and it totally backfires they won't be able to steal it they can only steal by
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:00.960]  small margins from top experts in my own research we'll get bev harris back on if you want from
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:09.760]  black box voting to go over that but this is it and this is how they operate and as you can see
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:13.520]  after and i told you when he went into first place over the weekend i said get ready to hear
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:19.520]  that he's a kook lux clan grand dragon i mean get ready to hear he is and they're like this crazy
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:24.240]  racist i actually saw an article said this crazy racist ron paul thinks that age was created to kill
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:31.280]  black people i mean they even like writing crazy oxymoron stuff it's like who are these people
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:36.960]  they hire and mainstream articles have spelling errors and jumbled stuff all over it i'm what i
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:41.760]  mean who are i guess to hire traders because a lot of good media people have left the mainstream
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:45.920]  media that's another reason there's a brain drain out of the dinosaur media and that's why the
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:51.680]  alternative media is now the media like that reporter we had on mr hunter yesterday he's
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:58.080]  worked for cnn you know abc nightly news all of it and he's look at him he's over there making more
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:03.680]  money reaching more people being being in front of the camera reporter and writer than he ever
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:08.880]  did working for them and he's not compromising and he said alex they're not the mainstream media
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:14.640]  anymore we are and you know what that's true that's why they're panicking they may sit up
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:20.800]  there in some 20 million dollar studio and we're in our you know 200 000 studio and it's all flashy
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:26.400]  and they got some per person in a three thousand dollar suit it doesn't matter you could dress up
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:34.400]  a rotten you know pig or something in a suit it's still gonna have maggots crawling out its eyes
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:39.200]  i'm going to your calls here i just wanted to go over some of this neo conscious ron paul with a
[01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:44.000]  peace hitler and the nazis that's an info wars article i mean i mean they're saying he he loves
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:51.600]  nazis uh now uh twilight zone us in a day story about ron paul leading an iowa headline ron paul
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:55.520]  is still not in the lead they admit he's in the lead but they said that doesn't matter just like
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:45:01.120]  the governor said a vote for him isn't real he just saying your vote doesn't count new rules
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:05.360]  make it possible for republican establishment to steal nomination from a candidate they don't like
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:10.240]  they've changed that now so they can come in and basically steal it
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:16.560]  the following rule was adopted by the republican party any presidential primary caucus convention
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:25.760]  or other meeting held for the purpose of selecting delegates to the national convention which
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:30.960]  occurs prior to the first day of april in the year in which the national convention is held
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:37.440]  shall provide for the allocation of delegates on a proportional basis and it goes into how
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:43.200]  they can then manipulate that there's another one seeing in lobs veiled charges of racism
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:51.840]  at ron paul got the video up at info wars dot com it goes on and on and on let's go back quickly to
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:58.160]  mike and then to dale mike and canada okay your points on ron paul go ahead uh yeah even if the
[01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:05.440]  first time you ever heard of ron paul was looking at his newsletter things after a couple of links
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:14.000]  you'd get right to prism planet you'd get to his answers in the debate and you would realize if you
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:21.760]  know especially if you're already uh skeptical of the mainstream news and one of your i got your
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:32.080]  shirt but says the answer to 1984 is 1776 and i think ron paul is 1776 you bet he is and that's
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:36.800]  why they're pulling out all the stops i mean look at rand he wasn't connected to a few newsletters
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:42.640]  they dug out of tens of thousands and they had people dressed up in hayseed outfits saying racist
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:47.280]  things and saying they supported him and it turned out they were on the other the person was running
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:53.520]  against campaign i mean they are going to do everything they can again the whole liberal system
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:59.680]  is about divide and conquer they're always claiming oh we're friends what did margaret sanger say she
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:05.040]  said we gotta pose as liberals we gotta hire black leaders so we can kill these weeds we gotta get
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:11.600]  them aborted we're gonna have to pose as liberals and she was a confidant of adolf hitler again i mean
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:16.080]  of course ron paul's newsletters had disdain for the welfare class both corporate and private
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:22.240]  and talked about people on welfare and stuff uh yeah again there's a difference between ron paul
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:29.280]  you watch him in those different uh talk show tv shows he went on that are on youtube uh morten
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:34.880]  downy junior and all the rest of them and people get up and say how dare you not want to attack
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:39.280]  other countries and have a giant military i want to legal and legalize drugs you know you're a
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:43.280]  trader you know we need to and he would get up and say well you're fat you know maybe the government
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:47.600]  should come make you not be fat you know i mean ron paul he should be really aggressive uh let's go
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:52.320]  ahead and go to i appreciate your call mike let's go to dale in kansas dale you're on the year

[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:41.040]  stinger missiles but i'll get to him one way or the other and we'll cover it all in the
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:44.480]  nightly news tonight that's one good thing about doing the nightly news a lot of the most important
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:53.040]  stuff i never get to on the radio but right now let's go back to dale in kansas so tell me the
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:59.040]  name of the of the base where you were what area of it was we'll go look on google maps but yeah
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:03.840]  that's what the model emergency centers establishment act says is that it's that it's already there
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:10.720]  at bases stockade facilities and that they've been set up and waiting for emergencies and now
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:14.480]  we have the documents saying the military is going to man them and we already knew that from some other
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:19.680]  documents but this shows it's all been green-lighted right now and it doesn't mean it has to go there
[01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:25.680]  but it shows that criminals that have gotten control of our government think that they're
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:30.560]  going to be able to just totally steal everything and have us sign on to all their derivatives
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:35.200]  and launch all these new wars because they've got control of the government through continuity of
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:40.160]  government uh but uh dale you say you were long haul truck driver when did you see this what did
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:47.280]  you see i've seen this about a year and a half ago about not a year ago and uh you know this is uh
[01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:52.240]  when i was in the on the base in kansas delivering a truck i've moved a lot of these military trucks
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:58.880]  to the base basis uh okay so so what base in kansas is this again well this is the base that i was
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:04.880]  pointing out is that has the FEMA camp is it camp shall be mississippi okay camp but yep okay camp
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:09.440]  shall be i've seen that on some of the credible list before camp shall be a lot of the stuff's there

[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:20.480]  leaving i've seen the but this camp you could tell it was not normally it's just like your
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:25.920]  good stopo uh prison camp i mean it was had a roll bar bar fans and everything and also while
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:30.640]  i was up in uh south dakota i was delivering something up there and i was out in the middle of
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:36.720]  nowhere and i like helicopters and stuff like that and i noticed this helicopter and it was coming
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:43.280]  at me and coming at me and and when it got closer i pay a little more attention to it had no markings
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:49.200]  on it all it had was the trilateral symbol on the belly of it and black is coal and people you tell
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:53.440]  people this stuff and they don't believe you i mean they just don't believe you and i i put my eyes
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:57:00.080]  on this stuff and every time i hear about it uh what about camp shall be mississippi from my memory
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:05.840]  that's a pretty big base what area is this in with the uh with the classic stockade the bar bar
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:12.640]  facing in okay it's on the uh as i was leaving i saw it so it was on an exit route out out of the
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:17.760]  base so if you look it up it's on the outside of it's not on the outside of the base but it's
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:24.480]  as you're leaving the base of the exits you know uh it's on the it's not on the entrance so describe
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:30.160]  it more describe why you knew it was a a theme account oh you can tell i mean it with the real
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:36.800]  bar bar fence and all it had was tents in there little tents uh and a whole bunch of porta potties
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:42.000]  on one end of it and then it had what really shook me up was when i saw the gang walk up on
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.840]  top of you know up at the top of the fence sure it's got an area for guards to walk around with
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:52.160]  shotguns right just like just like it's in prison camp and and uh that's what really shook me up
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:56.880]  and that has always stuck in my head and then uh you know of course i've been i watch this stuff

[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:37.840]  oklahoma city investigators one of them that was there when the bombing you know
[02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:45.120]  in the aftermath that is coming up in the next segment also in some of the other news obama
[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:51.200]  prepared to attack military action again obama prepared to take military action against iran
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:58.000]  denise ross a big obama advisor says if obama draws the conclusion that certain kind of steps
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:03.680]  should be taken against iran he'll take them yeah because he's completely blackmailed and controlled
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:12.640]  here's another one dozens of people die in roadside bombs in iraq right as the united
[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:17.920]  states begins to officially pull out it has all those advisors and embassy staff and mercenaries
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:27.120]  there and tony cartelucci writer for info wars dot com has a big article out in a move that almost
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:33.760]  defies belief it is so brazen and hypocritical many will not believe it no matter how many
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:38.960]  state department officials confirm it the u.s has been guarding a terrorist training camp
[02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:45.680]  inside iraq with u.s troops and is planning to relocate them possibly in a freshly abandoned
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:52.400]  u.s military base in iraq while dc lobbyists work feverishly to have them delisted armed and sent
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:02:01.200]  to conduct terrorist operations in iran and this is what two three weeks ago steve pacenek
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:07.600]  former state department official and terrorism expert talked about the m e k which is an admitted
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:12.400]  real terrorist group is basically working for the u.s government i mean what group isn't
[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:17.120]  because this isn't the u.s government ladies and gentlemen it's offshore mega banks that
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:22.400]  are totally ruthless and hire criminal mercenary groups the state's terror attacks all over the
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:28.960]  world to finance other terror groups the stage bombings here in the u.s to do it all so the
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:35.040]  system can take our liberties and freedoms and pose as our saviors and it is so incredibly
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:42.800]  dangerous on that front looking at korea and china ex-president carter sends condolences
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:52.080]  to kim jong-un and that only props these these these these crazy hereditary dictators up i
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:56.080]  understand they've got to have somebody who can diplomatically talk to these people but why did
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:02.400]  donald rumsfeld as the head of the big swiss company back in the mid-1990s transfer of the
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:09.440]  reactor systems so north korea could have nuclear weapons continuing a finland finds
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:14.960]  patriot missiles on china-bound ship marked as fireworks see while you're busy being told to
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:22.640]  be scared to death of al-qaeda under the table 10 000 plus missiles 2000 plus that are high tech
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:27.600]  surface to air missiles were basically given to al-qaeda and allowed to keep them when al-qaeda
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:32.080]  was given control of libya by nato and that's on record that's even mainstream news
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:38.080]  pull it up pull a blunt and telegraph headlines like al-qaeda flag now flies over libya al-qaeda
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:43.440]  being sent in to fight syrians al-qaeda works for the globalist that have hijacked this country
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:48.720]  people are like but why would they have them attack us so they can take all our liberties
[02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:53.600]  blame iraq that had nothing to do with it and invade them now they're blaming iran for 911
[02:03:54.160 --> 02:04:00.640]  next they'll blame you or maybe santa claus for it everybody but who's involved
[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:07.760]  the finnish authorities have impounded an isle of man flagship bound for china with undeclared
[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:13.600]  missiles and explosives british or u.s government they're always doing this police are questioning
[02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:20.720]  the crew of the ms-thor liberty after what were described as 69 patriot anti-missile missiles were
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:26.640]  found on board yeah you can also use a patriot to shoot air aircraft down all day long oh but
[02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:31.600]  they've been saying al-qaeda must have stingers left over from the 80s give all your rights up
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:39.760]  continuing here interior minister pavi rasson said the missiles were marked fireworks the
[02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:45.040]  ms-thor liberty was docked and finished port after leaving germany last week dock workers became
[02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:51.440]  suspicious after mr. napolitano told him to be i'm joking after finding explosives poorly stored
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:57.840]  on open pallets and missiles were then found in containers marked fireworks more on this coming

[02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:20.960]  it they don't say we're going to do it they just say it would really help us and if there's a new
[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:25.840]  one we're going to blame the right wing and uh barring that we're in deep trouble and i see all

[02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:51.440]  cover ups these efforts led him to collaborate with the oklahoma bombing investigation committee
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:56.000]  in their efforts to uncover the truth behind the okc bombing he was instrumental in the
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:01.520]  formation of the first low power fm station oklahoma to fight the globalist i had that part that

[02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:47.280]  but why are you here what did you see what is most important for us to understand and uh holland you
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:51.760]  can you know pretty much because you know him well and have studied oklahoma even more than i have
[02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:57.680]  uh where do you think we should go first well we can start with uh the day of the bombing of course
[02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:03.520]  when don responded and the get into the evacuations that were later denied that they took place then
[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:08.560]  the explosives that were found inside the building uh don you were the first to respond one of the
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:14.400]  first to respond to the bombing right yes sir and uh you and your dog uh gunny right great
[02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:19.120]  and uh one of the main points of the movie what we try to emphasize is the fact that there were
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:24.480]  several evacuations uh after the initial bombing that they were later denied they said they were
[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:32.400]  fall uh false alarms or hoaxes but in an oboli we have videotape from a sheriff's deputy taken during
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:40.320]  one of the evacuations that shows the atf pulling weapons and plastic explosives out of the building
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:45.920]  no one has seen this tape well some people had but it's been passed down hand to hand
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:50.240]  we digitally remastered the tape no one has seen into this quality and it's never seen
[02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:54.000]  widespread publicity yeah by the way that's the kind of stuff that's in this film
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:59.600]  is many of your team have been on this for over a decade i mean this is a obsession uh to you know
[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:03.680]  to get the murder of these children out i mean this is that's why it's so important well this is my
[02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:07.760]  hometown i grew up in oakland city and once i started realizing what had happened i felt
[02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:11.920]  it was my duty to to expose the truth i saw that no one else well i mean every other people were
[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:16.720]  doing it but i wanted to really get the story out to the people and we found a team we got a good
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:21.760]  director's team production editing and we we made the movie as the best way to get the the message
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:26.720]  out to the out to the mass exactly it's the only you know well done testament in modern time so
[02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:32.640]  let's get into why don is such an incredible witness and such an amazing expert well don
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:38.960]  you were actually in the building with the in the canine rescue units and during one of the
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:45.520]  evacuations uh what were they doing during the evacuations uh as far as the initial evacuation
[02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:49.680]  we're just trying to determine the location of the victims really trying to determine
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:59.840]  uh how to remove some of the debris uh at about 11 30 uh 10 30 11 o'clock that first morning
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:08.320]  we were halted for the first time um ordered out of the building for no other reason than
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:16.480]  then they wanted to secure the building uh on a limited access we were allowed back in uh in
[02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:22.400]  fact worked for a little bit uh in the area with uh Dana Bradley who's had her leg amputated
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:29.200]  the being pinned in the building uh worked in that area for the next little bit and then
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:36.080]  finally we were ordered out by us marshals uh we were sequestered pretty much on the uh south side
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:42.000]  of the murra building uh in the courtyard area uh was kind of held at bay told that we'd be allowed
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:46.000]  to go back in and search but there were files that were so critical to the government then until
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:51.600]  those files were found there would be no more rescue or recovery and there were people still inside
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:56.960]  yes sir yes sir there was a gentleman that was uh apparently he was already deceased but he was
[02:14:56.960 --> 02:15:02.960]  still laying uh bleeding out on the south base of the building and you could see that and they
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:09.120]  wouldn't let you recover yes sir because they had to recover documents correct uh what's important
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:14.560]  about that alex is that that maybe maybe one of the reasons that this happened is that they
[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:19.200]  their priority was on the documents for some reason recovering those documents to the detriment
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:24.320]  of the people who were trapped inside and died as a dilkham city police chief uh said on camera
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:29.840]  that we lost people because of the evacuations we lost people because of this because we have all
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:34.000]  the newscasts where the governors yeah they found more bombs they're they're taking them out that's
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:41.120]  another device the bomb squad has and here's don browning who was there uh with the dog uh and
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:46.880]  and was a police officer and also a uh a marine veteran so he i mean just amazing to see what was
[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:52.080]  going on we only have those newscasts what did you see with them and the reported bombs
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:58.320]  uh there was uh two different incidents where they they claimed that they had uh
[02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:06.720]  determined that there was a secondary explosive device uh they they uh quarantined that area
[02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:13.040]  i did not actually see them route removed the device from the building uh it was more to the
[02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:16.640]  northwest corner of the building from what i understood in the debris
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:24.160]  and i was still yet on the south side uh close to the elevator shafts but these evacuations did
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:30.000]  take place we have affidavits from first responders saying that there were at least two other bombs
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:34.800]  discovered in the rubble that one of these bombs was timed to go to go off 10 minutes
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:40.080]  after the first explosion this is uh a typical terrorist tactic is to have at least two bombs
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:45.040]  one to attract responders and the second bomb to inflict even greater casualties so there
[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:49.200]  i mean this could have been worse that's a bad thing about oakland city is as bad as it was
[02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:54.080]  it could have been much much worse now going through some of these questions what really got
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:17:00.160]  you asking questions and and i'm going from memory in second hand don how did things progress
[02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:03.760]  with the feds telling you to get out of there were you ever threatened like some of the other
[02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:10.560]  police were yes sir uh at one point that morning i was advised that we were going to be arrested
[02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:17.280]  by federal marshals if we did not leave the immediate area uh uh like i said we didn't want
[02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:22.640]  to be a hindrance didn't really understand what was going at that point uh so we did withdraw
[02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:30.160]  and stayed sequestered there on the court yard yard area uh in hopes that we were going to be
[02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:36.480]  allowed to go back in and uh uh interestingly we were advised to that point that no police dog
[02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:40.800]  would be allowed back in the building that there would be the search and rescue dogs will be coming
[02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:47.440]  in from private sources so they couldn't trust the uh oklahoma city police but they'd have some
[02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:53.600]  special people uh coming i want to get into all the technicals and the uh horse patrol being
[02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:57.680]  mobilized before the bombing and what taryn's gig he saw and you know really the key points here
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:04.000]  with you sir but bottom line from 16 years of researching this being in it and what you know
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:08.480]  and seeing this film as a police officer as an investigator as a veteran with a lot of
[02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:13.440]  different perspectives and and and and wisdom what do you believe really happened with oklahoma
[02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:19.280]  city i personally believe that there was a a secondary explosion i don't know whether it
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:25.840]  was sympathetic to the truck explosion and that it was just uh a armament that was stored in the
[02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:34.480]  morrow building uh but due to the uh destructive nature what what occurred uh in particularly in
[02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:40.240]  closer to the uh east side of the building on the south side where there was was just total
[02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:47.680]  destruction i do believe that there was at least a sympathetic explosion uh exactly then the damage
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:52.240]  pattern to the building when you look at it is asymmetrical to the truck bomb it's offset from
[02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:56.240]  the major damage to the building the crater is offset from the major bite as we show in the movie
[02:18:56.960 --> 02:19:00.000]  it's on the other end of the building from it and we can see it right behind you there
[02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:06.320]  the truck bomb was basically where your shoulder is uh holland uh you're a shoulder that's facing
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:12.720]  inward towards dawn and then if you see back in the corner where the earphone is where dawn is
[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:17.760]  that's that's where you had columns blown off at the base and parton says uh that it was you know
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:23.360]  specifically charges on those columns yes uh do we interview general parton uh i believe one of the
[02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:30.000]  first interviews ever anyone's ever given him on on on video and he was a former head of air
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:34.000]  force weapons development he spent 20 years blowing things up for the military and conducting
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:39.280]  bomb damage analysis this is his job he saw what happened in oakland city he saw the damage he knew
[02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:45.360]  it could not be an ammonium nitrate truck bomb so he analyzed it his famous parton report which
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:50.080]  concluded that the columns inside the mirror building were destroyed due to brazance damage
[02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:55.760]  meaning that there were contact explosives on the columns that the truck bomb was not the
[02:19:55.760 --> 02:20:00.400]  sole cause of destruction that day that truck bomb did do a lot of damage and it was powerful
[02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:04.560]  but what it would have done to the mirror building was basically blown in all the windows and damaged
[02:20:04.560 --> 02:20:09.200]  the facade and certainly well that's what you see in saudi arabia with trucks full of full of military
[02:20:09.200 --> 02:20:14.240]  grade is it just blows the facade off and blows things through the building sometimes both sides
[02:20:14.240 --> 02:20:18.720]  but the columns are right there the supporting columns were there and the mirror building
[02:20:18.720 --> 02:20:24.400]  was constructed in the 70s with bomb resistance in mind because there was a there was a lot more
[02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:29.600]  political instability going on in the post 60s arabic communist bombing stuff yeah exactly it
[02:20:29.600 --> 02:20:35.440]  was a federal building it was designed with with bombs in mind and those columns would not have failed
[02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:39.360]  due to a truck bomb that is an impossibility in fact the american society of civil engineers
[02:20:39.360 --> 02:20:44.800]  uh was not even allowed on site to do their own analysis they they did an analysis but they were
[02:20:44.800 --> 02:20:49.040]  kept 200 feet back well that's another issue they they blow up the wreckage more than half the
[02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:54.400]  building standing there they act super suspicious they threaten people hoppy hollaburg police
[02:20:54.400 --> 02:21:00.640]  officers doctors that show up uh the the the atf's in their full gear like a minute after
[02:21:00.640 --> 02:21:05.520]  as a police officer don watching them act so suspicious i mean what does that look like to
[02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:10.000]  you and what did other police officers to tell you off record their view was on this
[02:21:11.280 --> 02:21:13.200]  well but one one of the bomb
[02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:22.080]  officers was describing to me one of what he thought was a one of the secondary devices
[02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:25.280]  and he said that he had a clock real similar to it sitting on his desk
[02:21:26.480 --> 02:21:32.720]  which was just a a three-road stick of dynamite with an alarm clock stuck on just kind of a
[02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:39.200]  decoration uh type thing and uh really was serious about trying to dismiss me if that's
[02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:47.040]  what they thought was a secondary uh device and uh of course we kind of then we got a little more
[02:21:47.040 --> 02:21:53.040]  more involved in our conversations and he said that they did find nitrous bottle uh end caps uh
[02:21:53.680 --> 02:21:59.520]  you know other things that would help accelerate the uh info bomb exactly one of the stories they
[02:21:59.520 --> 02:22:04.320]  propagated to uh cover one of the evacuations that that that three different bomb squads
[02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:11.600]  had mistaken a toy alarm clock as a real bomb which is ludicrous and uh no reason to evacuate
[02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:14.960]  the entire building before that could actually be concluded as retained on the site you wouldn't
[02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:18.320]  evacuate the building before you actually determined that it was a bomb especially because there's
[02:22:18.320 --> 02:22:25.280]  people inside bleeding out um but you've got pieces of the building blown the opposite direction away
[02:22:25.280 --> 02:22:31.360]  from the truck bomb on top the building across the street exactly that truck bomb exploded on
[02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:36.080]  the north side of the building yet uh north of that across the street there were chunks of the
[02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:41.360]  mirror building that somehow transported themselves against the blast wave of the truck bomb and
[02:22:41.360 --> 02:22:46.320]  that's the thing about this this whole story is that it is a conclusive fact that that truck bomb
[02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:52.000]  was not the sole cause of agent yet the cover-up has gone into effect everyone on the scene knows
[02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:56.560]  that the truck bomb was not the sole cause of destruction and we see how the mainstream media
[02:22:56.560 --> 02:23:01.360]  and the government is able to manipulate a story take what is actually reality which is that there
[02:23:01.360 --> 02:23:05.200]  were bombs inside the building that did most of the damage and change it to something else
[02:23:05.200 --> 02:23:10.720]  destroy the crime scene while there were still bodies inside a month after the bombing they
[02:23:10.720 --> 02:23:15.040]  they demolished that building and there were still a number of people in sight uh deceased
[02:23:15.040 --> 02:23:19.600]  persons of course but they they were in such a rush that uh they wouldn't even recover the
[02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:25.280]  bodies don was there for that right right yeah we did pull the uh in fact we had located
[02:23:26.880 --> 02:23:31.760]  one of the female victims uh that we had to leave inside the building uh the night of the fourth
[02:23:31.760 --> 02:23:38.000]  and uh the building was pretty unstable uh in that area uh but rather than trying to short
[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:44.320]  anything that we were uh removed uh the building was brought down and we were allowed to go back in
[02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:51.840]  the 29th of May and and uh research the area and uh did locate that lady along with uh one of her
[02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:57.280]  female companion workers and other gentlemen that had died in the blast well i know this is hard to
[02:23:57.280 --> 02:24:02.400]  talk about uh a lot of key questions we haven't gotten to yet here don browning retired Oklahoma
[02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:07.120]  city police officer canine rescue handler uh was there right after the one of the first people
[02:24:07.120 --> 02:24:11.440]  there on the scene the former u.s. marine vietnam veteran as well could you tell us you've told
[02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:16.240]  us about the marshals threatening the police what about fbi threatening you specifically
[02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:25.200]  within the the weeks that followed after the uh the actual uh currents fbi agents were assigned to
[02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:30.960]  set up a communication station at the uh Oklahoma city police canine and equine center
[02:24:32.640 --> 02:24:36.400]  and they ran out of our office through the day of course we were supposed to just conduct
[02:24:36.400 --> 02:24:44.000]  businesses normal and uh they were still concluding their investigations but was told more than once
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:50.000]  or twice uh agents in the area that uh people like my wife and i would end up have ended up dead
[02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:57.760]  but not going along with what uh we need to be true wow so you're a you're a decorated
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:03.200]  vietnam veteran police officer uh one of the heroes that responded when there could have been other
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:10.560]  bombs and was thought there were other bombs and the fbi agents in the police office are telling
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:15.040]  you do what you're told are you and your wife are dead and you're you're saying this on record here
[02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:22.000]  sir yes sir please elaborate for the millions of listeners uh exactly what happened and you'd
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:28.240]  like to name names uh i'm not afraid of these people um uh as far as names i really don't know
[02:25:28.240 --> 02:25:33.840]  i do know there was an agent uh jim height that uh had contacted me uh that was concerned about the
[02:25:33.840 --> 02:25:40.960]  health of the dogs uh right about the same time um his story was that the building had been uh
[02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:49.760]  sprayed with a uh an agent similar to agent orange to try to slow decomposition
[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:56.800]  um in the thorough supposed it was complaints that the odor of the decomp is becoming an issue to
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:06.160]  uh to the surrounding area in the community um again there were just different things that
[02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:10.640]  occurred to just have something to divide my understanding why they would why they would
[02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:18.400]  use something such as agent orange uh without warning i've said of what they were doing
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:25.840]  uh but i mean separately how did i mean did they phone call you i mean did an agent in the hall
[02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:29.360]  say hey you better do what you're told are you and your wife are dead i mean i mean how would they
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:34.240]  talk to you no they were it was person person in the hallway they were in the officer at the canine
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:38.800]  center so they'd say do what you're told are you and your wife are dead right and what did you say to
[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:48.480]  that it wasn't wasn't too much i'd say i i uh got y'all right and uh i was not at that time was
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:54.960]  really not in a good mood uh to hear their crap i had a major from our department that was telling me
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:27:01.600]  that uh i needed to find new friends and he thought i was part of the militia uh okay so they're
[02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:06.000]  intimidating you they're isolating you and then they're they're threatening you and your wife
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:12.000]  in a hallway i mean i just there's the it's so unbelievable you probably had one of the perpetrators
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:17.680]  right there with you i just oh my god well i mean that's that's one of the thing about the one of
[02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:23.360]  the things about this when you see the behavior of the federal agents on the scene and afterwards it
[02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:30.800]  makes you question what their mission is entirely because they were not responding in a uh professional
[02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:37.280]  manner they pulled people back to pull off the videotapes don you witness that yes i watched uh
[02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:43.440]  uh while we were being sequestered there in a courtyard i did watch agents uh with raid ATR
[02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:48.880]  i'm sorry i mean i have raid jackets on uh removing cameras from video cameras from the
[02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:52.720]  corners of the mirror building tapes that we've never seen those cameras would have recorded
[02:27:52.720 --> 02:27:57.120]  everything that happened in front of the mirror building you know if we are if we are wrong and
[02:27:57.120 --> 02:28:01.360]  they want to prove it you know if you can show the tape that shows mcvey getting out of that truck
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:04.480]  and that truck causing the damage to that building i'll go home and i'll never talk to you well they
[02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:10.080]  declared national security some good fb agents have gone public as you know in the la times
[02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:14.880]  nine years ago and they said they've seen the tapes there's 20 something of them and it does show
[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:20.240]  mcvey with a bunch of other men and that's why the government doesn't want it released exactly
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:25.760]  and the only secret service timeline uh records that when they looked at the tape that there were
[02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:31.600]  suspects exiting the truck three minutes after it was parked plural that means multiple suspects but
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:36.960]  to this day they insist mcvey was the only person who drove that truck up don bernie mentioned dana
[02:28:36.960 --> 02:28:42.560]  bradley earlier uh during the trial of mcvey in denver they could only produce one witness who could
[02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:48.320]  place mcvey in oklahoma city that was dana bradley she lost her children and her mother and her leg
[02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:52.400]  in the bombing uh she gained some notoriety because she was trapped in the rubble and they had to
[02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:58.080]  amputate on site uh under cross examination she admitted that when she was in the social security
[02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:02.880]  office waiting in line she saw that writer truck pull up tim mcvey got out of one side
[02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:08.560]  and a suspect another man got out of the other side under cross examination admitted this
[02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:13.600]  and then the federal prosecutors tried to drag her name through the mud and say that she had
[02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:18.640]  misremembered the day that it was another day that she had lost her entire family and her leg
[02:29:18.640 --> 02:29:24.880]  that she saw that writer truck pull up with two people it's just ludicrous and insulting unbelievable
[02:29:24.880 --> 02:29:31.520]  uh we have holland vanden newhoff uh investigator filmmaker and don browning oklahoma city police
[02:29:31.520 --> 02:29:37.360]  officer us marine vietnam veteran uh was one of the first to be there we'll talk about terrence
[02:29:37.360 --> 02:29:42.880]  yankee and his murder another police officer that responded on the other side folks i don't like
[02:29:42.880 --> 02:29:47.920]  risking my life to expose these people but we've got to they're getting ready to do it again well
[02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:56.560]  they ride back stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[02:29:56.560 --> 02:30:06.480]  network a very wealthy u.s citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important

[02:33:18.240 --> 02:33:23.680]  months before new mexico that even came out on discovery channel uh they were embarrassed that
[02:33:23.680 --> 02:33:27.680]  that they wanted to get anti terror funding and laws passed that they've now gotten through
[02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:34.240]  a course in 93 so they torched waco that blew up in their face and so then they um carried out
[02:33:34.240 --> 02:33:40.320]  oklahoma city to blame it on domestic groups and on the states rights movement and to make
[02:33:40.320 --> 02:33:44.480]  bill clinton look like a victim he could demonize talk radio and conservatives and i mean it was
[02:33:44.480 --> 02:33:52.160]  so obvious by their instant response in minutes it was all scripted and i remember being in austin
[02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:55.840]  and people were mailing the tapes down and putting them on access tv that's why i went down and got
[02:33:55.840 --> 02:34:02.160]  an access tv show in 95 was watching the soap opera every week of the tapes mailed down to
[02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:07.040]  patriots from oklahoma city and the other patriots locally putting it on with the bombs coming out
[02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:11.680]  of the building and general parton at press conferences and hoppy heidelberg being threatened
[02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:18.000]  and you know all this stuff going on and then you find out that so many of these other events
[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:23.280]  have been staged and and then to have these police officers killed and threatened and and

[02:34:42.640 --> 02:34:47.760]  are gonna get it if you don't stop what you're doing i mean wow i mean why would an fbi agent
[02:34:47.760 --> 02:34:53.920]  do that unless they were involved i mean you're now threatening to kill cops and their wives
[02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:59.840]  that's who runs this government and the same crew is in charge now the guy that's the attorney

[02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:53.600]  event right there where they weren't just letting them get sold at gun shops that was the cover
[02:35:53.600 --> 02:35:59.920]  we now know 18 wheelers into mexico and in the federal cases drugs back in i mean
[02:36:00.560 --> 02:36:05.680]  eric holder is just a mob boss well you were talking about uh you had hoppy heiberberg on
[02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:09.600]  the show earlier this week uh you were talking about the threats he received what's interesting
[02:36:09.600 --> 02:36:14.960]  about that is that the fbi agent who threatened hoppy heiberberg is named john hurstley john
[02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:20.800]  hurstley was basically the fbi's representative to the prosecution during the trial john hurstley
[02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:25.520]  was there with his partner threatening hoppy heiberberg with a gun if he kept on talking about
[02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:32.000]  what had happened behind closed doors at the grand jury that uh indicted mcvay and nickles and others
[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:37.040]  unknown john hurstley is now the go-to guy for the history channel or and whoever else
[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:41.520]  wants to do an apology for the official story john hurstley is there in a suit and tie with
[02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:46.400]  the american flag behind him representing the united states government that man is a thug
[02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:52.400]  he threatens people with guns and he's on tv trying to explain the official story in fact he
[02:36:52.400 --> 02:36:57.920]  wrote a book oh ghost ghost wrote a book about the bombing about the official story and the title
[02:36:57.920 --> 02:37:05.200]  is called simple truce simple truce which is always what the nobelize cloaked in a simple truth
[02:37:06.960 --> 02:37:13.680]  uh don uh what were you looking into that made fbi agents threaten not only you
[02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:21.360]  but to kill your wife i was trying to follow up uh i had a lot of citizens uh that was calling
[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:27.120]  given information uh we're trying to follow through with with uh different tidbits of
[02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:33.440]  information that's getting even from a person such as janey carver dell and glennon wilbur and his
[02:37:33.440 --> 02:37:42.880]  wife uh i felt obligated as a police officer uh that that we should be looking into all those
[02:37:42.880 --> 02:37:48.880]  things and they were uh pretty frustrated that that for the most parts they were being ignored or
[02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:57.360]  or uh being told it didn't matter it was it was similar to like um dana bradley i would
[02:37:57.360 --> 02:38:04.800]  mentioned earlier i was called into the uh new attorney's office and was questioned as to what
[02:38:04.800 --> 02:38:13.360]  she said to me the entire time that i was near her i wanted to know every fm but every i ever t
[02:38:13.360 --> 02:38:19.280]  uh she was groaning she was in pain there was no
[02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:26.240]  noticeable conversation that came from her but they wanted to know what she'd seen and what
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:31.760]  she'd told you exactly and the woman penned under giant girders who lost her leg and
[02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:35.280]  they're and they're wanting to know what did she say what did she say so as a police officer
[02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:41.520]  you're saying the feds were acting super guilty yes sir yes sir that it was it was well i was
[02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:46.480]  told at the time that they're they were going to have to repeat what she was uh saying apparently
[02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:52.800]  she was and she was delirious me too her injuries and and her losses i bet you know she'd lost
[02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:57.840]  family members again in there uh incredible let's let's talk about terrence yaggy tell us about
[02:38:57.840 --> 02:39:02.160]  this gentleman who was one of the first people along with you to respond you know running into
[02:39:02.160 --> 02:39:08.000]  the building that you know just been uh uh uh devastated and then what happened to him why
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:15.840]  this is so important well terry uh first off was was a remarkable young man he was he was very
[02:39:15.840 --> 02:39:22.240]  likable i did not work with him uh showed her to show her uh uh in our assignments at the
[02:39:22.240 --> 02:39:27.280]  police department however i did work a lot of extra jobs and uh security work with him uh
[02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:33.840]  not good friends but friends enough that especially after the bombing i would always
[02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:40.800]  tease terry about man you're my hero uh you know you you live uh you're just you're just my hero
[02:39:40.800 --> 02:39:47.200]  hell he made the cover of newsweek right yeah yeah he hauled a lot of people out right yes sir and uh
[02:39:49.840 --> 02:39:55.920]  terry bless his heart right off the bat was concerned because the worst many fba and atf
[02:39:55.920 --> 02:40:02.320]  agents on the scene uh even when he drove up uh turn me drive up and there's feds and their gear
[02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:06.880]  running around everywhere what 30 seconds after yeah he should he showed up just minutes after
[02:40:06.880 --> 02:40:12.640]  eternity was the first officer to respond he pulls up and there are fba agents on scene the fba
[02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:18.640]  headquarters is is five miles away they have no business why are atf agents and fba agents at the
[02:40:18.640 --> 02:40:23.120]  scene of the bombing sitting there watching what's going on when the first officer to respond pulls
[02:40:23.120 --> 02:40:29.600]  up well they were proud of their work i mean uh well there was there was an operation going on
[02:40:29.600 --> 02:40:34.160]  they're blowing up some kids in a daycare that's that's that's that's what tough guys do well don
[02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:38.720]  you were uh given private information about a surveillance operation by the fbi that was going
[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:44.560]  on at the time right concerning the the vehicle description yeah they always claim that so when
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:51.200]  it happens oh well it was a sting went bad yeah well no quite interestingly the um uh the morning
[02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:59.120]  of the bombing uh as i was in in route downtown uh there were simulcasting the three vehicle
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:06.720]  description along with the uh seven person mills that were supposed to occupy these vehicles uh
[02:41:06.720 --> 02:41:14.800]  that they had left on the interstate systems run them or a building area and uh surprisingly we were
[02:41:14.800 --> 02:41:21.520]  told that these vehicles were still under surveillance and continued the fbi said that yes so the fbi
[02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:27.440]  told the police that they were watching the suspects but the building blows up and they
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:32.880]  don't stop the suspects but no no please don't understand this supposedly was afterwards this was
[02:41:34.080 --> 02:41:41.520]  supposedly a suspect so the bombing sure sure um that went on through all the morning up until
[02:41:41.520 --> 02:41:47.360]  about 130 uh at that point i had an opportunity to speak to one of the fbi agents that had kind of
[02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:54.400]  slowed to take a break and asked him what the status was and uh was informed at that point that uh
[02:41:54.400 --> 02:42:01.120]  um that was disinformation that was designed to throw the press off and uh was nothing but
[02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:08.960]  disinformation uh i became very irate at the time uh and that they were they were broadcasting
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:14.160]  as to a five state area uh it was not only throwing all the media off it was throwing every cop in the
[02:42:14.160 --> 02:42:20.720]  world uh off as well uh if this was fictitious information all the perps want to throw folks
[02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:27.280]  off so so karen shaggy pulls up a minute or so after and it's crawling with fbi and atf and
[02:42:27.280 --> 02:42:36.080]  then what happens next well he goes ahead and works with the uh recovery uh from one understand
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:42.960]  over the the next few days after uh after that incident he had started to complain to janet rino
[02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:49.840]  and to others uh about the treatment that he was getting from the fbi agents and also from
[02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:54.720]  from the fact that there were so many of them on the scene it was quite quite concerning to him
[02:42:56.240 --> 02:43:01.760]  we talked a little bit about uh some of his concerns and some of my concerns but we both were still um
[02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:10.240]  i'd say it still wasn't really that trustworthy even of one another uh it was it was a time where
[02:43:10.240 --> 02:43:15.360]  you really didn't know who you could trust um completely or not sure if you're not a completely
[02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:19.600]  unconscious moron you pull up and there's it's like watching a guy run out of a bank with a
[02:43:19.600 --> 02:43:24.080]  mask on a bag of money you know who you pull up there's feds running around and they're in their
[02:43:24.080 --> 02:43:28.720]  full gear right after it happens you're like what's going on they're like oh nothing in fact there
[02:43:28.720 --> 02:43:32.880]  were doctors and people there who they would say patch me up i was up on the ninth floor and the
[02:43:32.880 --> 02:43:37.360]  doctors are like well there's nothing wrong with you you weren't up there and he's like well you're
[02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:41.680]  gonna end up dead if you you know don't do what i say i mean there's death threading i just can't
[02:43:41.680 --> 02:43:46.960]  imagine people just i'm a fed i'm gonna death threat police and everybody else because i'm god
[02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:54.320]  i mean sounds like a bunch of lunatics they are it uh i was interesting like i said with with terry
[02:43:54.320 --> 02:44:02.640]  in that uh uh when when terry died he was not treated as a normal police officer there was no
[02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:11.360]  autopsy performed uh he of course was was viewed by a medical examiner and they did complete the
[02:44:11.360 --> 02:44:20.480]  uh best certificate in in follow-up reports uh but no autopsy nothing to describe uh why the injuries
[02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:29.040]  that uh terry had suffered where they came from or what what type of injuries those were but we do
[02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:33.840]  have that what thanks for colonel correct roberts going from memory we do have the the basic medical
[02:44:33.840 --> 02:44:37.760]  examiner's drawings and and of course that you know you guys have talked to some of the witnesses
[02:44:37.760 --> 02:44:42.400]  and some of the sheriff's department i know from the county over that that did show up reportedly
[02:44:42.400 --> 02:44:47.840]  and and so go over this in detail the feds are like digging dirt up yeah terrence yaggy's obviously
[02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:53.760]  been tortured i mean as a police officer go over what happened to him terry had numerous
[02:44:54.560 --> 02:45:02.320]  lacerations on his wrist across his elbows on both arms he had a long cut that began just
[02:45:02.320 --> 02:45:08.960]  uh underneath his right ear and extended past his uh adam's apple uh there was another small
[02:45:08.960 --> 02:45:16.400]  hesitation cut on the left side of his throat uh uh he you think that was when they were just
[02:45:16.400 --> 02:45:20.640]  threatening to slit his throat to get the answers or where the stuff was well i was told by the
[02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:25.680]  district attorney when i went to the grand jury that was due to uh emt trying to save terry's life
[02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:31.280]  no and of course he'd been dead well i mean let's go over i mean let's talk about how he died
[02:45:31.280 --> 02:45:35.360]  because i mean he was telling his partner i got feds behind me last time he was heard from right
[02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:42.160]  terry was uh transporting documents and uh evidence that he had collected he called his
[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:47.200]  friend uh the police officer said uh let's meet for dinner as soon as i shake these feds were
[02:45:47.200 --> 02:45:52.400]  following me we'll meet terry went to el Reno terry grew up in el Reno Oklahoma he knew all the back
[02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:59.520]  roads and his car is found on federal property el Reno has a federal prison the reason the federal
[02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:03.600]  government was able to come in and take control of the investigation was that his body was found on
[02:46:03.600 --> 02:46:10.800]  federal land yesterday did that again wow exactly and when his he had handcuff marks on his wrists
[02:46:10.800 --> 02:46:15.760]  there was mud packed into his wounds there was no way he could have drug himself through the mud a
[02:46:15.760 --> 02:46:22.560]  mile and a half through creeks and trees while bleeding and then decide to shoot himself at an
[02:46:22.560 --> 02:46:27.760]  angle at the top of his head coming out the lower part of his jaw sure so let me ask this cops
[02:46:27.760 --> 02:46:31.680]  everybody shows up i mean you talk about the county shows up and they said yeah the feds were
[02:46:31.680 --> 02:46:35.280]  covering it up and the police all just stand around and well they killed him that's i mean
[02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:38.960]  that's all the police we've talked to yeah they killed him and i guess that's just what
[02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:43.840]  feds are god they want to kill cops go ahead you know well that's what was interesting uh to me
[02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:49.680]  at that point was anytime we had a police officer involved in automobile accidentary
[02:46:49.680 --> 02:46:57.280]  thing outside of the city limits uh the city still sent investigative officers out to investigate the
[02:46:57.280 --> 02:47:04.400]  accident of nothing else to supplement whatever agency did do the investigation uh with terry
[02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:11.200]  basically our agency just washed their hands of it and turned it completely over to the fbi and uh
[02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:16.960]  yeah whatever police officer dies uncle c there's always an autopsy a couple years ago a police
[02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:21.760]  officer died in a car wreck um and there was no question about why he had died it was on duty
[02:47:21.760 --> 02:47:26.320]  he was responding to a call they still performed an autopsy yet they find a police officer just a
[02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:33.360]  couple years before in a field cut uh bleeding a year after a year after he's the hero of
[02:47:33.360 --> 02:47:38.080]  oklahoma city on the cover of newsweek and police officer of the year shot in the head
[02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:44.000]  and they do not perform an autopsy once again it does not hold up the scrutiny at all well who is
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:49.360]  who was this this police chief i mean who is either purely wicked or the biggest coward on the planet
[02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:57.120]  he was a uh chief Gonzales was from the dallas fort worth area had been on dallas peony uh
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:02.880]  priority is being hired with oklahoma city he really didn't have uh connections to oklahoma
[02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:09.200]  city um and would frequently leave uh for extended weekends to go play golf in dallas uh
[02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:14.880]  um uh really never did feel like he was a portion of our department at all so he was just a
[02:48:15.440 --> 02:48:22.000]  he's just a placeholder yes sir he's also a young uh patrolman in dallas on november 22nd 1963
[02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:30.560]  oh really so he's a very trustworthy person uh me i don't i don't know if he had any involvement
[02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:37.600]  with that but that's that is his background i'd like to end rather okay uh continuing uh here
[02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:41.360]  there's a lot of other points here that are important um you tell us about the horse patrol
[02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:47.440]  being mobilized for crowd control prior to the bombing yes sir uh again that was one of the
[02:48:47.440 --> 02:48:54.160]  things that kind of surprised me the horse patrol basically uh during the week did not patrol any
[02:48:54.160 --> 02:49:01.600]  area they maybe once or twice uh one or two of the officers would saddle up and they would go
[02:49:01.600 --> 02:49:09.120]  into the stockard area uh horses are for special events right i mean big crowds yes sir uh interestingly
[02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:14.480]  they had uh anytime we did work a big event they would have the county reserve would also
[02:49:14.480 --> 02:49:21.280]  come in and supplement the uh with horses and manpower and they would act out uh together
[02:49:22.560 --> 02:49:28.240]  the warning of the bombing uh the horse patrol was going downtown in force uh
[02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:33.520]  uh they claim they really don't know why they were going down there wasn't necessary for
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:39.520]  crowd control they was going down to to work the downtown area this was about a week before
[02:49:39.520 --> 02:49:46.720]  what we were scheduled to have a um an art festival that would mandated that they would
[02:49:46.720 --> 02:49:52.320]  have had to be there so it was it uh they were they were coming up on some time frame where a
[02:49:52.320 --> 02:49:56.240]  lot of overtime was going to be required so it was kind of surprising that they would just
[02:49:56.240 --> 02:50:04.400]  uh out of the blue uh decide to gather and go downtown uh to do this this quite large work
[02:50:04.400 --> 02:50:10.000]  patrol there was probably uh somewhere between eight to ten riders and horses that were in
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:15.920]  route was that order uh to settle up given before the bombing yes sir they were they were actually
[02:50:15.920 --> 02:50:20.080]  leaving and would have already been downtown by the time the bomb went off according to one of
[02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:26.480]  the supervisors had it not been for one of our officers uh was slow in getting ready and uh
[02:50:26.480 --> 02:50:32.320]  they were just pulling out of the k-90 coin center when the bomb detonated are we come back
[02:50:32.320 --> 02:50:37.840]  i'm going to ask you what do the rank and file oklahoma city police think 16 17 years after
[02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:42.160]  this tragedy that's been used to butcher the bill of rights and constitution this is another
[02:50:42.880 --> 02:50:49.120]  super uh disgusting thing we have to discuss but i mean it's only going to get worse if if
[02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:53.840]  if we don't wake up to false flag terror don browning retarded home city police officer one

[02:54:11.280 --> 02:54:16.880]  wife i love life and i've been threatened i've been beat up before when i was exposing the
[02:54:16.880 --> 02:54:22.480]  wake-up situation in the trial and bullhorning the judge and they sent five guys for him attack me
[02:54:23.200 --> 02:54:26.800]  beat me up pretty bad but i picked him up too at a parking lot telling me shut up
[02:54:26.800 --> 02:54:32.000]  they broke my nose and punched me i mean that but you know what that was when i knew how real this
[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:39.360]  was okay and the federal government is run by a bunch of criminals now who just think that we're
[02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:45.440]  here to be doormats and our our property our children belong to them and we can beat these
[02:54:45.440 --> 02:54:50.400]  people but let me tell you living in denial this isn't about just criticizing the government
[02:54:50.400 --> 02:54:54.400]  and we come up with fanciful tales this is a police officer who was there and saw all this
[02:54:54.400 --> 02:55:00.160]  who had fbi agents threatened to kill him and his wife other cops got killed doctors got killed
[02:55:00.160 --> 02:55:06.320]  rangers got threatened these are fbi comes to your house with guns and says shut your mouth
[02:55:06.320 --> 02:55:13.760]  then people come and say you're dead if you keep this up this is what they do i mean and and
[02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:19.680]  somebody's got to call them on it somebody's got to realize it that this country i mean they are
[02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:24.320]  now announcing they're going to use the military against the american people we get the department
[02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:29.120]  of defense contact joe joseph calls us and says if you've seen this it's on the federal government's
[02:55:29.120 --> 02:55:35.120]  own website and then they pull it where they they call the american people the enemy the red group
[02:55:35.120 --> 02:55:40.480]  and the government is the blue group and i mean the general public is listed as the enemy that's
[02:55:40.480 --> 02:55:45.280]  not the american government you get a police officer's questioning and they go we think you're
[02:55:45.280 --> 02:55:48.960]  in a militia implying they were involved in it because they're asking questions
[02:55:50.800 --> 02:55:56.640]  you cannot control reality by being delusional you can't just say oh this couldn't be true like
[02:55:56.640 --> 02:56:01.360]  the awesome police chief said two weeks ago when i was talking to him privately and i looked in his
[02:56:01.360 --> 02:56:06.880]  eyes and i could tell he's not stupid he says he listens to the show he knows and he said some
[02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:10.800]  things privately to me i don't want to get him in more trouble not saying what he said he didn't
[02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:14.640]  say it's off record he's just like yeah i'll probably never get promoted above austin because
[02:56:14.640 --> 02:56:19.520]  i'm even on your show but i don't care anymore alex i know you're a good guy i'll see you later
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:25.040]  but the point is that's not enough you've got i can tell our police chiefs a real person he's
[02:56:25.040 --> 02:56:29.680]  you've got to choose what side you're on in closing don browning and people can get the film
[02:56:29.680 --> 02:56:33.440]  which people have given their lives if you'd be able to know this information nobelie at info

[02:56:37.600 --> 02:56:42.800]  bandit new and hoff one of the other police officers around you say or i mean do they just
[02:56:42.800 --> 02:56:53.040]  give in to the big lie it's interesting it's kind of a combination of both where i summer are literally
[02:56:53.040 --> 02:57:03.760]  uh scared to death uh terry yakey's good buddy at one point uh met me short effort terry had died
[02:57:03.760 --> 02:57:09.040]  told me that i was on the right track please keep one pushing terry deserved that but he couldn't
[02:57:09.040 --> 02:57:19.040]  help me and uh officer for the most part do uh or at least at this point starting to finally come
[02:57:19.040 --> 02:57:24.400]  out with the feelings and emotions that they they did not eat the story they they didn't battle it
[02:57:24.400 --> 02:57:30.320]  but they did not eat the uh the information was handed out to us why didn't you guys just
[02:57:30.320 --> 02:57:35.280]  why didn't you guys get together and circle the wagons and say we got guns too you want to threaten
[02:57:35.280 --> 02:57:40.400]  us at the time of the circling of the wagons i don't think we felt like there was enough of
[02:57:40.400 --> 02:57:45.840]  us to circle uh even half of the circle so we had to well there wasn't at the alamo either
[02:57:45.840 --> 02:57:51.360]  but we appreciate your incredible courage sir but sometimes it takes some of us getting wiped out
[02:57:51.360 --> 02:57:55.840]  so other people can see and then that's when we get the victory what was interesting i'll
[02:57:55.840 --> 02:58:03.280]  share a comment that steven jones made when i was up at mcvay's trial uh jones came to me he had been
[02:58:03.280 --> 02:58:08.880]  part of the uh roger dill stafford defense team when roger dill stafford did committed the uh
[02:58:08.880 --> 02:58:17.600]  certainly stockade murders and i had testified in that case as well and uh i'd sit with my
[02:58:17.600 --> 02:58:23.280]  head as i was walking up towards him coming back to the hotel and uh he he stopped me and he says
[02:58:23.280 --> 02:58:28.640]  you know if only four or five oakland city homicide detectives would investigate this we'd
[02:58:28.640 --> 02:58:33.600]  have this solved in two or three days and uh i tell you what sir we're out of time but you've
[02:58:33.600 --> 02:58:38.000]  been gracious enough to be on the nightly news tonight i want to start over where we left off
[02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000]  here incredible
