[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:22.620]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22.620 --> 00:35.560]  I'm always having such an incredible brainstorm. Once I get off the radio each day until late
[00:35.560 --> 00:40.760]  at night and then as soon as I wake up in the morning and then before I get on air here,
[00:40.760 --> 00:44.760]  reading the news, watching video clips, thinking about all the points I want to make on each
[00:44.760 --> 00:52.840]  little issue, that is why I am a frustrated researcher. I am a frustrated person who is
[00:52.840 --> 01:01.320]  trying to glean reality because even though I focus my full intellect on it, it just becomes
[01:01.320 --> 01:06.180]  more fantastic by the day and then I see the general public taught to not even care about
[01:06.180 --> 01:13.440]  reality and just accept the tiny false spectrum projected by the masters of culture through
[01:13.440 --> 01:18.120]  the television set and then regurgitate it out through other mediums.
[01:18.120 --> 01:25.720]  It is truly mind blowing. Max Keiser on central banks buying the most gold that they've ever
[01:25.720 --> 01:31.120]  purchased in modern history is gonna be joining us on that and a host of other economic issues.
[01:31.120 --> 01:37.760]  He's predicted that you're gonna see financial meltdown by the end of April, an accelerated
[01:37.760 --> 01:44.360]  meltdown. We're also going to get Wayne Madsen formerly in the National Security Agency.
[01:44.360 --> 01:47.280]  He's a journalist, of course, who's written for most of the major publications in the
[01:47.280 --> 01:54.480]  country. He has Wayne Madsen report.com. I saw a story like this in the Daily Mail. Former
[01:54.480 --> 01:59.480]  airline pilot and conspiracy theorist shot dead his two teenage children and his dog
[01:59.480 --> 02:01.120]  before turning the gun on himself.
[02:01.120 --> 02:06.680]  And from what I know about Philip Marshall, he was tied into black ops and stuff. And
[02:06.680 --> 02:13.280]  he wrote a book about Saudi intelligence involvement in 9-11, which they certainly were, 15 of
[02:13.280 --> 02:17.680]  the 19 hijackers from Saudi Arabia. And he said that he was fearing for his life, but
[02:17.680 --> 02:20.840]  magically he reportedly shot his children.
[02:20.840 --> 02:25.840]  He reportedly shot himself and the children, but he was fearing for his life. Kinda like
[02:25.840 --> 02:30.140]  Gary Webb caught people breaking into his house, the Pulitzer Prize winner for Dark
[02:30.140 --> 02:34.560]  Alliance on CIA drug trafficking, and then got shot twice in the head. One shot blew
[02:34.560 --> 02:42.120]  his jaw off where it was hanging by one connection, blew the mandible partially off.
[02:42.120 --> 02:48.200]  Shot him in the side of the head with a shotgun, and then they shot him in the back of the
[02:48.200 --> 02:52.880]  head. So he obviously put up a fight, I guess, there at the end. And the police immediately
[02:52.880 --> 02:59.000]  just said, it's normal to shoot yourself twice. I have another article here out of the one
[02:59.000 --> 03:06.520]  in Telegraph. Police hunt two men after oil chief assassinated in Brussels, the European
[03:06.520 --> 03:08.040]  head of ExxonMobil.
[03:08.040 --> 03:11.600]  That's arguably the biggest corporation in the world. I know they say Walmart or Apple
[03:11.600 --> 03:16.920]  are, but ExxonMobil, when it comes to real power, is the top dog from my research. Rex
[03:16.920 --> 03:24.960]  Tillerson, I think still in its head, a Rockefeller owned subsidiary. ExxonMobil, ExxonMobil.
[03:24.960 --> 03:28.960]  And you gotta love this article, police are hunting for two men after a British executive
[03:28.960 --> 03:32.960]  working for the oil company ExxonMobil was shot dead in front of his wife in the street
[03:32.960 --> 03:35.120]  in an assassination style killing.
[03:35.120 --> 03:42.520]  And the police within minutes of Nicholas Mockford, 60, said, no, we don't think it
[03:42.520 --> 03:50.840]  was an assassination. Guys with motorcycle helmets shot him three times execution style,
[03:50.840 --> 03:56.280]  punched his wife in the face when she tried to save him. Jumped on, that's trained killers
[03:56.280 --> 03:59.600]  only kill who they're paid to kill, they had to pay extra for her to get killed.
[03:59.600 --> 04:05.680]  Jump on the motorcycle, probably the police, usually really good governments who are good
[04:05.680 --> 04:09.320]  at killing people in corporations, actually higher than the local hit team is the police.
[04:09.320 --> 04:13.360]  Belgian police, though, have imposed a news blackout. Well, cuz they gotta protect their
[04:13.360 --> 04:17.200]  officers, I'd say they're the prime suspects, whether they're behaving. After Nicholas Mockford
[04:17.200 --> 04:24.960]  60 was shot as he left an Italian restaurant in Nieder over Hembeek, a suburb of the capital.
[04:24.960 --> 04:29.760]  He was shot execution style three times, twice and then he hit the ground and then once in
[04:29.760 --> 04:40.320]  the head. Once he lay on the ground after leaving the De Marcellio restaurant there
[04:40.320 --> 04:41.360]  at about 10 PM.
[04:41.360 --> 04:48.160]  So had his last meal and they're like instantly, we bright bartered him. Why don't they just
[04:48.160 --> 04:56.760]  say like, butros, butros, golly, you know, claimed that the Pakistani president had fallen
[04:56.760 --> 05:02.240]  and hit her head. Remember that?

[08:10.780 --> 08:24.360]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[08:24.360 --> 08:32.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, the 19th day of February 2013 and I am blessed to be
[08:32.840 --> 08:39.800]  above ground. I'm here to tell you every day above ground is a good day. Isn't it, Tony,
[08:39.800 --> 08:46.500]  to quote Scarface? We are live, ladies and gentlemen, and we're gonna get into why the
[08:46.500 --> 08:50.560]  mega banks and ultra rich are buying gold at record levels.
[08:50.560 --> 08:55.440]  While busily telling the public to dump theirs, we're gonna look at the acceleration in the
[08:55.440 --> 09:02.160]  currency war that the G20 has been talking about with Max Keiser, always informative,
[09:02.160 --> 09:08.400]  always a popular guest in the third hour today. Wayne Madsen, former NSA officer syndicated
[09:08.400 --> 09:14.360]  columnist, he's got intel, there's all sorts of political assassinations going on.
[09:14.360 --> 09:19.720]  Meanwhile, police hunt for two men who killed the European head of Exxon Mobil execution
[09:19.720 --> 09:23.760]  style. They say they don't think it's foul play, just a mugging or something. That's
[09:23.760 --> 09:29.320]  why they killed him execution style, didn't steal anything. Author and former intelligence
[09:29.320 --> 09:35.680]  contract pilot, accused in murder, suicide. Wayne's investigated that and says that it
[09:35.680 --> 09:41.920]  looks like he was taken out, he was an author exposing Saudi intelligence involved in 9-11.
[09:41.920 --> 09:50.200]  So he went bye-bye. And you really learn who has the power when you're in the media and
[09:50.200 --> 09:53.960]  you criticize somebody like the Saudis and there's instant repercussions.
[09:53.960 --> 10:00.500]  You put a YouTube video up criticizing them, and within minutes, YouTube bans it and puts
[10:00.500 --> 10:05.880]  a strike on you. You really learn who's got a lot of power. British royalty doesn't like
[10:05.880 --> 10:09.760]  being criticized either. They advertise all that, they don't have any power, the opposite
[10:09.760 --> 10:10.760]  is the case.
[10:10.760 --> 10:15.020]  Okay, here's the deal. Let me just mention some of the headlines. We'll see if I can
[10:15.020 --> 10:22.180]  do it without plunging into the first or second story I get into. But we are going to roll
[10:22.180 --> 10:28.760]  through a lot of news today in the hour and a half or so before our guest joins us.
[10:28.760 --> 10:36.360]  Breitbart has now gone in and totaled up and so has WorldNetDaily totaled up. We've been
[10:36.360 --> 10:47.520]  saying 1.75 billion bullets, 1,750,000 something million. Sorry, it's now over 2 billion bullets,
[10:47.520 --> 10:52.400]  but that has not stopped AP implying that I'm making this up.
[10:52.400 --> 10:57.520]  But it doesn't matter, they can try to shoot down the messenger. The information is getting
[10:57.520 --> 11:05.740]  out there. Why is the government bought enough bullets for a 24 year war in Iraq? The troops
[11:05.740 --> 11:09.960]  used 5 million bullets a month at the height of the Iraq war. So breaking those numbers
[11:09.960 --> 11:13.640]  down, it's enough for a 24 year Iraq war.
[11:13.640 --> 11:17.560]  And that's just, I'm sorry, Breitbart did the actual numbers crunching. In the last
[11:17.560 --> 11:23.000]  12 months, it's over 2 billion. If you count what went back before that, because I've just
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.040]  been adding up what I've seen in the news, I was saying 1.75 billion. And as usual, it's
[11:28.040 --> 11:35.080]  worse than I said. So actually, it's true, I am inaccurate. It's worse than I said, which
[11:35.080 --> 11:37.640]  is the case almost every time.
[11:37.640 --> 11:44.880]  Boy, okay, so there's that. Meanwhile, a Seattle Times, they're saying, a misstep, we wanna
[11:44.880 --> 11:49.920]  do home inspections, and they have built a ban semi-auto. And that's freak people out,
[11:49.920 --> 11:54.520]  the police will be coming in your house. So they're saying, we need to get the guns incrementally.
[11:54.520 --> 11:57.840]  That's an article called misstep and gun bill could defeat the effort. So they're very upset
[11:57.840 --> 12:01.480]  at themselves. And they're like, hey, we gotta sneak up on these people. We don't wanna have
[12:01.480 --> 12:04.800]  an open fight with them that were tyrants.
[12:04.800 --> 12:11.420]  All gun shows halted in Maryland County. They tried that in Travis County named after William
[12:11.420 --> 12:17.160]  Barrett Travis, if you can believe that or not. Right here in Austin, where I live, the
[12:17.160 --> 12:23.120]  city, they tried to ban having a gun show, period, even on private property. That sounds
[12:23.120 --> 12:27.800]  like San Francisco, next is banning gun shops in the city.
[12:27.800 --> 12:35.900]  So there you go, all gun shows halted, period. No gun shows allowed, WTOP television. Here's
[12:35.900 --> 12:40.720]  another one we're gonna be getting into along that front. Mother of Virginia boy who was
[12:40.720 --> 12:47.120]  arrested over toy gun criticizes case and handling. And she says, how is a toy orange
[12:47.120 --> 12:53.920]  gun brandishing a weapon when all he did was say, let's go after school and play with our
[12:53.920 --> 12:54.920]  toy guns.
[12:54.920 --> 13:01.920]  My goodness, we all play with toy guns at school. And this is the mind control that
[13:01.920 --> 13:06.580]  we're dealing with as a society. And they're going ahead, he has a probation officer. They're
[13:06.580 --> 13:12.320]  going ahead with the trial because the mother won't plead and put him on probation. And
[13:12.320 --> 13:16.440]  they're gonna put a jury up there and tell him he's guilty, a 10-year-old, of felony
[13:16.440 --> 13:17.440]  brandishing.
[13:17.440 --> 13:22.000]  And they're trying to send him to juvenile hall that you can go read the articles there.
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.160]  They're very, very, very proud of this. 10-year-old arrested for toy gun as probation officer,
[13:26.160 --> 13:30.040]  lawyers, and second court date could end up in permanent criminal record. What can end
[13:30.040 --> 13:35.600]  up in jail is the goal. He'll go to criminal college now at 10. And people are like, well,
[13:35.600 --> 13:36.840]  this is injustice.
[13:36.840 --> 13:42.040]  That's the whole point. I mean, if you can arrest a parent and give them $500 tickets
[13:42.040 --> 13:47.840]  or whatever for their three-year-old urinating in the yard, do it. If you can tell the jury
[13:47.840 --> 13:52.280]  this is brandishing of a weapon, doesn't matter the statute has to say that it is a real weapon.
[13:52.280 --> 13:58.040]  Doesn't matter the jury's so stupid and the judge is so evil and the prosecutor's so evil.
[13:58.040 --> 14:04.840]  I see cases every day reading the news where people are sent to jail and spend hard time
[14:04.840 --> 14:13.000]  hard time in state pens and federal pens for things that aren't illegal.
[14:13.000 --> 14:18.000]  Because the public doesn't know which end is up. We're in a lot of trouble here and
[14:18.000 --> 14:26.620]  admitting this can reverse things. Would you like a case point example of people doing
[14:26.620 --> 14:29.120]  hard time for things that aren't illegal?
[14:29.120 --> 14:35.800]  I give you a lot of them. I bet you can think of some. Last time I checked it's now 16 states,
[14:35.800 --> 14:41.720]  it was just 14 a few months ago that arrest people for filming police in public aggressively
[14:41.720 --> 14:47.840]  and charge them with wire tapping, which is illegally taping someone on their own property
[14:47.840 --> 14:49.320]  or tapping into a wire.
[14:49.320 --> 14:52.560]  Which is what the government's doing with the smart meters and all the rest of it to
[14:52.560 --> 14:57.680]  show the hypocrisy and the paradox there. And the hilarity of it if it wasn't so serious.
[14:57.680 --> 15:04.880]  And there are people serving three, four, five year prison sentences all over the US,
[15:04.880 --> 15:09.320]  hundreds of them in Illinois. The Chicago Tribune's done a bunch of reporting on it
[15:09.320 --> 15:15.120]  saying it's a good idea by the way. And they even tried to put people in jail for life.
[15:15.120 --> 15:20.200]  The state has actually put briefs in at the county level saying yes, we want these individuals
[15:20.200 --> 15:32.800]  in jail for life, for life, for life. One guy, it was five charges, 15 years apiece.
[15:32.800 --> 15:36.920]  There it is, Massachusetts man charged with wiretapping for recording cops. Guys, it's
[15:36.920 --> 15:40.480]  making me mad. I can't remember the name of the guy. Type in man faces life in prison
[15:40.480 --> 15:43.440]  for filming police or taping police, Illinois.
[15:43.440 --> 15:49.200]  We've had him on, I just wanted to. And they had five consecutive 15 years sentences, and
[15:49.200 --> 15:52.440]  they were having a real case where the state attorney came down to the county and they
[15:52.440 --> 15:58.680]  were saying we really want this precedent, life in prison. Now imagine the off the chart
[15:58.680 --> 16:05.920]  North Korean tyranny of that. The off the chart that Michael Allison was his name, that's
[16:05.920 --> 16:06.920]  right.
[16:06.920 --> 16:12.640]  There it is, man faces life in jail for recording police. And then after he beat him in court,
[16:12.640 --> 16:16.200]  they would drive back by his house and pull up in his yard. He lives on the edge of town
[16:16.200 --> 16:23.280]  and he fixes classic cars. He's like a rockabilly, but the real deal. And making money off fixing
[16:23.280 --> 16:24.280]  up 57 Chevys.
[16:24.280 --> 16:27.360]  So it turned out they wanted a bunch of the cars, they were so valuable, hauled them off
[16:27.360 --> 16:31.600]  his junk. And so now they'll pull by and get out in his yard and when he films them, they
[16:31.600 --> 16:38.040]  arrest him again. Cuz they don't care, they want life in prison, okay? You are going to
[16:38.040 --> 16:42.160]  take your cars, you're going to prison for life. And the state attorney came down and
[16:42.160 --> 16:47.680]  said, we want this precedent, judge. Do not throw this out, we want life in prison.
[16:47.680 --> 16:53.040]  And the judge got so much pressure, he dismissed the case. So they've now gone and tried to
[16:53.040 --> 16:59.920]  arrest him again with new filings. Imagine some guy with no criminal record in overalls
[16:59.920 --> 17:05.600]  who fixes classic cars, no criminal record, lives in the house his parents had a junkyard
[17:05.600 --> 17:13.440]  behind it. And this guy out in the country, films police taking his cars away and so he
[17:13.440 --> 17:15.280]  faces life in prison.
[17:15.280 --> 17:21.520]  That's America. We have another clip today of a little girl crying, the TSA tells the
[17:21.520 --> 17:25.600]  two year old you can't have your dolly, men in uniforms are taking the two year old away.
[17:25.600 --> 17:29.600]  I mean my kids, she cousins and uncles they haven't seen a while and when they're little
[17:29.600 --> 17:34.000]  and hide behind you and are scared at first, that's normal instinct. Imagine you're at
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.920]  a big bright lights, people walk over, they're gonna grab your two year old, they've got
[17:37.920 --> 17:39.520]  the dolly.
[17:39.520 --> 17:43.440]  And they said, please can they have whatever dolly's name was, it's in the article, it's
[17:43.440 --> 17:49.960]  like Binky or something. When will you take her away to frisk her, can she have Binky?
[17:49.960 --> 17:55.040]  And the woman's like, that's illegal to film me, that's it, police, got a new video today.
[17:55.040 --> 18:01.320]  Of course, it's not illegal to film. I mean, that's why my wife's like, I wanna fly, I'm
[18:01.320 --> 18:06.320]  sick of this, I wanna go places. And I'm like, listen, what are you gonna do when they grab
[18:06.320 --> 18:08.480]  our small daughter and drag her off?
[18:08.480 --> 18:12.520]  I mean, they're gonna target me at the Austin airport, they do. I mean, I walk up, they
[18:12.520 --> 18:18.160]  go, Alex, okay, I mean, they all know who I am. I'm gonna go to a place where people
[18:18.160 --> 18:24.920]  are gonna target my kids and drag them off. And if they cry, it's all over, folks. They'll
[18:24.920 --> 18:27.720]  arrest little kids for crying, that's evil.
[18:27.720 --> 18:32.680]  You got peanut butter, they'll arrest you for terrorism. See, I'm not joking, life in
[18:32.680 --> 18:38.340]  prison for filming police in Illinois. Now, see, that's how my brain works. That's why
[18:38.340 --> 18:43.720]  I get so frustrated, is I read article about the mother's going, this is an overcharge.
[18:43.720 --> 18:49.680]  You're gonna put him in jail, a 10-year-old, he's a good kid, had an orange toy gun in
[18:49.680 --> 18:53.540]  his backpack on the bus and said, let's go play cops and robbers.
[18:53.540 --> 18:58.120]  And now the prosecutor's throwing the book at him? The mother doesn't even know that
[18:58.120 --> 19:05.840]  it's not illegal, and that they falsely charged and falsely applied the penal code of the
[19:05.840 --> 19:16.560]  Virginia state law. He didn't brandish a weapon, it has to be a weapon for brandishment. It's
[19:16.560 --> 19:24.240]  a 10-year-old, it's not applicable. It doesn't matter, listen, he is prey.
[19:24.240 --> 19:28.800]  This is the new slavery, is to get you in the criminal justice system, to get you in
[19:28.800 --> 19:32.480]  the welfare system, or to get you working for a mega-corporation where they control
[19:32.480 --> 19:36.800]  you. The name of the game is control. Now, I got through about five, six stories. When
[19:36.800 --> 19:43.120]  we come back, the top stories, the demonization of the Tea Party goes into ultra, ultra high
[19:43.120 --> 19:50.760]  gear. Folks, WWE creates racist wrestler to demonize the Tea Party, and guess who he's
[19:50.760 --> 20:01.040]  a fan of? Alex Jones. On WWE, they're really getting desperate.
[20:01.040 --> 20:05.240]  Your freedoms are on the line. The Second Amendment is in danger. How soon before your
[20:05.240 --> 20:10.080]  freedoms are taken away? What can you not live without? What is your greatest dependency?
[20:10.080 --> 20:15.480]  Is it your guns? Is it your home? No, it's food. It all boils down to the food supply.
[20:15.480 --> 20:20.320]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply. Don't be dependent, be
[20:20.320 --> 20:25.020]  self-sufficient. Don't wait for the government to feed you, feed yourself. I can warn you,
[20:25.020 --> 20:29.960]  but I can't feed you. Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoods Direct.

[24:25.600 --> 24:30.100]  Coming up in the next segment, I'll get to WWE creates racist wrestler to demonize Tea
[24:30.100 --> 24:36.860]  Party. They say that the racist, cuz he's not just against open borders. He then says
[24:36.860 --> 24:45.080]  ridiculous things and his manager does. Jake Swagger, the former real wrestler and football
[24:45.080 --> 24:46.080]  player.
[24:46.080 --> 24:50.980]  And then they go out and say ridiculous things to demonize. And I've been getting calls about
[24:50.980 --> 24:56.280]  this for a while, but Watson actually got sent one of the clips and it has between 14
[24:56.280 --> 25:02.460]  and 15 million viewers a week. So to give you an idea, that's something like 25, 30
[25:02.460 --> 25:08.300]  times the size of Piers Morgan's audience. People say, wrestling, that's fake. Nobody
[25:08.300 --> 25:09.300]  believes that.
[25:09.300 --> 25:13.560]  Really? I'd say about half the wrestling fans. I grew up in Dallas, Texas, folks, around
[25:13.560 --> 25:17.740]  it all, okay? I go to the shopping mall, there'd be the Von Erichs there, everybody yelling
[25:17.740 --> 25:22.480]  and screaming, running after them. I'd say about half the kids in my neighborhood thought
[25:22.480 --> 25:28.000]  it was real. And then they'd get to be teenagers and pile drive some neighbor kid and put them
[25:28.000 --> 25:29.000]  in a coma.
[25:29.000 --> 25:36.180]  That actually happened. They had to ban wrestling at the school during the lunch recess cuz
[25:36.180 --> 25:40.860]  people were body slamming each other. They're like, I don't understand, they do it on TV.
[25:40.860 --> 25:43.980]  It's like, hey, Bubba, there's some redneck kid who just picked up some little kid and
[25:43.980 --> 25:50.740]  body slammed him. Hey, it isn't real. You body slam somebody like that, you kill him.
[25:50.740 --> 25:56.500]  And Watson shows the Twitter feeds. It was like, we'll get him, we'll get Alex Jones,
[25:56.500 --> 26:02.660]  these racist filth. And then of course, he battles the guy with the Mexican flag and
[26:02.660 --> 26:08.020]  Mexico wins. He's the villain, see? And he likes Rush Limbaugh, Alex Jones, and Glenn
[26:08.020 --> 26:09.020]  Beck.
[26:09.020 --> 26:17.820]  We have all these clips coming up. We're gonna get you evil Mexicans. I love Alex Jones.
[26:17.820 --> 26:22.860]  And it's because Vince McMahon's a big Republican, so is his wife, ran for Senate. You've got,
[26:22.860 --> 26:28.380]  I'm already covering this, I guess. I'm gonna get more to it in the next segment. You've
[26:28.380 --> 26:33.620]  got his wife again running for Senate.
[26:33.620 --> 26:38.460]  You've got Karl Rove demonizing the Tea Party, demonizing constitutionalist libertarians.
[26:38.460 --> 26:43.660]  I mean, if you're not left of Lenin, Karl Rove doesn't like you now. And so it's a full-on
[26:43.660 --> 26:49.540]  attack. I mean, even old line neo-con style conservatives like Rush Limbaugh are being
[26:49.540 --> 26:52.260]  demonized by the Republican Party.
[26:52.260 --> 26:55.940]  And Glenn Beck is being demonized. And of course, you know I am, because what's happening
[26:55.940 --> 27:00.280]  is I'm pulling those guys more towards the Constitution and Bill of Rights and away from
[27:00.280 --> 27:04.700]  all this left-right business. I mean, look, I can't go to Mexico and get free health care.
[27:04.700 --> 27:10.940]  I can't go to Mexico and get anything. Mexico's got 110 million people in Mexico, 30 million
[27:10.940 --> 27:14.860]  Mexicans here that aren't US citizens, that's a conservative number. The media says it's
[27:14.860 --> 27:17.180]  15 million, it's more than double that.
[27:17.180 --> 27:23.820]  And they have been taught racial ideology attached to the socialism and collectivism
[27:23.820 --> 27:28.560]  of the Democratic Party. And the Republican Party leadership is the very same mega corporations
[27:28.560 --> 27:34.060]  that want the cheap labor. And this is part of a program. And so it's now time to just
[27:34.060 --> 27:38.260]  get rid of the borders, part of the North American Union that Bush signed.
[27:38.260 --> 27:44.500]  With Vicente Fox, the Mexican president and the Canadian president back in 2005, just
[27:44.500 --> 27:49.220]  north of me in Waco, Texas at Baylor University. And by the way, the treaty was secret for
[27:49.220 --> 27:55.460]  about three years till Judicial Watch sued to get the Banff Canada meetings in 2007.
[27:55.460 --> 28:01.780]  It's, I guess, two and a half years. And these are on Judicial Watch's website, they're in
[28:01.780 --> 28:07.060]  my film Endgame, and they had a copy of the treaty in the minutes of that meeting. And
[28:07.060 --> 28:12.700]  so they got the treaty. And it's to get rid of the borders, only allow certain development
[28:12.700 --> 28:17.340]  zones and multinational corporations to operate who will be tax exempt.
[28:17.340 --> 28:21.820]  You and I will not be tax exempt. I have articles about that today about Obama's development
[28:21.820 --> 28:25.660]  zones. They're not Obama's development zones, they're the New World Order's development
[28:25.660 --> 28:29.500]  zones. That's why the Republicans won't stop this.
[28:29.500 --> 28:34.860]  And they've made it now a racial pride, Mexico. See, Mexico's allowed to have its nationalism,
[28:34.860 --> 28:39.900]  the US isn't. But the globalists are just set piecing to bring both countries down into
[28:39.900 --> 28:47.940]  each other into a larger global corporate colonized system. And it will destroy the
[28:47.940 --> 28:48.940]  Mexicans, it will destroy Americans.
[28:48.940 --> 28:54.540]  I don't care what color or what, quote, culture you come from. And that's the mastermind stroke
[28:54.540 --> 28:59.700]  of the globalist. I've got articles today where the top 100 corporations are totally
[28:59.700 --> 29:06.700]  tax exempt. Of course, that's on record as well. The mega families are tax exempt. Zuckerberg
[29:06.700 --> 29:12.660]  and his public offerings just have been given over just a massive amount of money tax exempt
[29:12.660 --> 29:15.740]  on their public offering.
[29:15.740 --> 29:22.300]  It is incredible. That's the real discrimination, that they're setting up inland ports that
[29:22.300 --> 29:30.140]  are tax exempt, but your company isn't. See, it's all about selective enforcement. And
[29:30.140 --> 29:35.340]  meanwhile, all we're talking about is racial stuff, and they're imploding the two countries
[29:35.340 --> 29:36.340]  into each other.
[29:36.340 --> 29:41.380]  I'm gonna cover this when we get back. Then the incredible UN news and the city of LA
[29:41.380 --> 29:44.940]  says they're gonna have me arrested. I'm gonna tell you about that. Stay with us, it's all
[29:44.940 --> 29:49.620]  coming up. I'm Alex Jones.
[29:49.620 --> 30:01.060]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[40:03.900 --> 40:10.900]  Most of the white people are now gonna be idiot bad people who are racist and hate Hispanics
[40:11.340 --> 40:17.620]  and then get defeated by guys with Mexican flags. That's right, Jack Swagger, we gotta
[40:17.620 --> 40:22.420]  do a whole video piece on this. He comes out every night and fights a Mexican guy with
[40:22.420 --> 40:25.300]  a Mexican flag who then defeats him.
[40:25.300 --> 40:32.300]  I hate some Mexicans. And then he gets beat up. I mean, wow. And that's Vince McMahon,
[40:33.020 --> 40:38.980]  who's a big establishment, Rhino Republican. He's a billionaire with his form of theater.
[40:38.980 --> 40:44.220]  Men in tights, ballet, and all of this is going on. And you got about a large portion
[40:44.220 --> 40:47.980]  of the audience that thinks it's real. I've known adults that will call in and go, it's
[40:47.980 --> 40:54.980]  real. No, no, it's real. It's real. And I'm like, really? I've seen somebody body slammed
[40:56.060 --> 40:57.140]  who was in a coma.
[40:57.140 --> 41:01.380]  This is not real. Okay, I'll assure you, grown men who are six foot eight, pounding each
[41:01.380 --> 41:05.540]  other in the face one time, blood's gonna be pouring everywhere. No, it ain't. But almost
[41:05.540 --> 41:09.580]  all these folks never been in a real fight. They're like little arrested development,
[41:09.580 --> 41:14.820]  toddling pot bellies who were like, we're gonna go to the matter of white Hispanic black.
[41:14.820 --> 41:19.380]  It's like it's the same. They look the same. They act the same. It's real. Let's go watch
[41:19.380 --> 41:25.340]  the big guy fight. It's real. I mean, most of them have got about 80 IQs. They're borderline
[41:25.340 --> 41:29.780]  mentally retarded. I mean, I'm very sad about this. It's just a fact. Okay, you got people
[41:29.780 --> 41:31.540]  that are there to laugh at it.
[41:31.540 --> 41:35.340]  And then you've got people there that think it's real. And you don't really go to watch
[41:35.340 --> 41:41.020]  the wrestlers. I know folks that are into this. Billy Corrigan puts on wrestling, and
[41:41.020 --> 41:44.300]  it's a big joke and fun for him, the Smashing Pumpkins guy. I'm gonna get him back on, by
[41:44.300 --> 41:46.180]  the way, when he's out for South by Southwest.
[41:46.180 --> 41:50.980]  The point is, is that if it's entertainment, that's great. But you've got the people there
[41:50.980 --> 41:56.420]  who don't understand half the audience is there to laugh at you. You are the entertainment,
[41:56.420 --> 42:01.220]  okay? All right, I'm digressing. Let me just get to this and then get to all the other
[42:01.220 --> 42:12.140]  news. Now, you've gotten the last week CNN and Atlantic Wire and others both saying that
[42:12.140 --> 42:17.500]  I said the United States attacked Russia with secret space weapons with a meteorite.
[42:17.500 --> 42:21.260]  When I said it was a comet or a stone meteorite, now the Russian government has officially
[42:21.260 --> 42:26.060]  said they've studied pieces of it. They believe it was a rock and snow comet. That's why it
[42:26.060 --> 42:30.820]  burned that bright is the water will actually burn when it heats up like that. Okay, boom,
[42:30.820 --> 42:32.020]  I was correct as usual.
[42:32.020 --> 42:41.700]  Not hard to know. It can be a stone meteorite. It can be a iron ore or nickel meteorite.
[42:41.700 --> 42:46.260]  Or it can be what they call a comet, but they have another technical name for it that's
[42:46.260 --> 42:52.060]  escaping me. Hold on, I even printed it up this morning from memory. Yes, here it is.
[42:52.060 --> 42:58.500]  The object was identified as a solitary 10-ton bolide, which is in the comet family. Okay,
[42:58.500 --> 43:02.620]  now, we put articles out saying it's a comet or a stone meteorite.
[43:02.620 --> 43:06.700]  On record, these other pieces are spurs. That's why I think it was a stoning and not a bowler
[43:06.700 --> 43:11.820]  or a polar or whatever they call it. The point is, is that all this is going on. They put
[43:11.820 --> 43:18.580]  out a report saying that, well, I can show you the article. They're like, yeah, our analysis
[43:18.580 --> 43:19.940]  is Alex will be Alex.
[43:19.940 --> 43:24.680]  There he goes again saying the US attacked Russia with space weapons. And then CNN the
[43:24.680 --> 43:30.540]  same day as last Friday, yeah, Alex Jones supports Dorner, the cop killer. Yeah, he's
[43:30.540 --> 43:35.620]  a problem isn't he, man, loving dead cops. There's cops watching CNN going, Alex Jones
[43:35.620 --> 43:38.720]  wants to kill cops. He likes Dorner.
[43:38.720 --> 43:44.820]  When I was getting criticized for saying, Dorner, the story was true, is a monster killing
[43:44.820 --> 43:49.100]  people's children to get at them. And that's the worst thing you can do. That's no hero.
[43:49.100 --> 43:53.560]  That's not a vigilante. You don't kill somebody cuz you saw a cop beat somebody up and they
[43:53.560 --> 43:55.220]  didn't get fired, allegedly.
[43:55.220 --> 44:01.420]  I'm sure there was more going on. Doesn't matter what I really said. Because CNN and
[44:01.420 --> 44:08.620]  MSNBC and all these other outfits are preying on their audience just like Vince McMahon
[44:08.620 --> 44:17.740]  and his establishment Republican wife. And so you and I who know how silly this is, we're
[44:17.740 --> 44:19.300]  sitting there watching this going, this is ridiculous.
[44:19.300 --> 44:22.780]  But you imagine folks, this is what's taught in Mexico where they hand out maps about to
[44:22.780 --> 44:27.300]  get to the US. They teach the Southwest belong to Mexico. Yeah, I did for about 20 years.
[44:27.300 --> 44:31.740]  Belonged to the Russians, belonged to Spain, belonged to the French. No one could hold
[44:31.740 --> 44:36.700]  it. Western settlers came in and were able to hold it.
[44:36.700 --> 44:41.060]  That's what happened. It's the six flags of Texas. But the point is they teach, you're
[44:41.060 --> 44:45.660]  poor cuz America took Texas and California. No, you're poor cuz you never got out from
[44:45.660 --> 44:50.820]  under colonialism and never had a 1776. I want Mexico to be free. I want Mexico to be
[44:50.820 --> 44:57.540]  prosperous. But there is a virulent anti-American, anti-white system pushed in Mexico.
[44:57.540 --> 45:01.620]  Let's just be honest about it. And now in Spanish media owned by globalist, owned by
[45:01.620 --> 45:06.100]  white guys predominantly, they teach it in the dramas, the sitcoms, everywhere. My wife
[45:06.100 --> 45:09.700]  speaks Spanish. She grew up in Spain. She goes, look at that billboard. Listen to that
[45:09.700 --> 45:13.620]  radio. I mean, when I first married her, she didn't really know about all this stuff. She's
[45:13.620 --> 45:14.620]  like, are you kidding?
[45:14.620 --> 45:19.060]  And then she sees Mexican grocery stores about. For those in the race, you're welcome to come
[45:19.060 --> 45:25.500]  in. The Raza, the Raza, those in the race, everything, those outside the race, nothing.
[45:25.500 --> 45:30.000]  This is Ku Klux Klan stuff. I've gone and protested the Ku Klux Klan. But why is it
[45:30.000 --> 45:35.400]  acceptable to have this where they have a fake white guy play the part of discrediting
[45:35.400 --> 45:39.300]  wanting to have sovereignty and wanting to have the same rules on immigration that Mexico
[45:39.300 --> 45:42.420]  has that are, well, not even the same, there's a draconian.
[45:42.420 --> 45:46.660]  And the idea of you don't totally give in to the globalist for a North American union
[45:46.660 --> 45:51.380]  that won't help Mexico. NAFTA and Gatsch destroyed them as well. And then you get all the Mexican
[45:51.380 --> 45:57.240]  drug gangs and almost 60,000 dead the last few years. And all of this, and then all this
[45:57.240 --> 46:03.780]  racial identity when you can't have nationalism or racial identity in America, period, if
[46:03.780 --> 46:04.780]  you're white.
[46:04.780 --> 46:10.020]  And you're told all day how white people are inherently bad. And Arabs are saying ban the
[46:10.020 --> 46:14.940]  Lego Star Wars set. Jabba the Hutt's supposed to be an Arab. It's racist, had nothing to
[46:14.940 --> 46:21.260]  do with Arabs. But it's not meant to make sense. It's meant to put you on the defensive
[46:21.260 --> 46:25.740]  and then also make you become racially based so the globalist can then play us off against
[46:25.740 --> 46:28.100]  each other just like when they have a prison.
[46:28.100 --> 46:34.080]  America is the model of a prison. America is the model of a prison where they have the
[46:34.080 --> 46:38.100]  Asian gangs, the Mexican gangs, the Latino gangs that have to be separated from each
[46:38.100 --> 46:43.180]  other. You have several blocks of the black gangs in the white area, and they're all racially
[46:43.180 --> 46:47.700]  motivated. And if you don't get the Nazi tats, you're gonna be gang raped the first day if
[46:47.700 --> 46:50.120]  you get in a serious penitentiary.
[46:50.120 --> 46:55.020]  You will join the Nazis and probably bend over for them, or you're gonna be knifed to
[46:55.020 --> 46:59.500]  death and the jail guards run the operation, bring drugs into them to sell. And it's the
[46:59.500 --> 47:03.860]  same thing, you will join the black gang or you're gonna be knifed that day and everything
[47:03.860 --> 47:08.920]  else. You will join the Mexican gang. This is how they want culture set up.
[47:08.920 --> 47:13.600]  The Romans divided Rome, the city of Rome up into districts and played the grips off
[47:13.600 --> 47:18.740]  against each other and then had a stronger militarized brigade over the city that controlled
[47:18.740 --> 47:25.180]  them. This is ancient great game imperial management systems. And so imagine you've
[47:25.180 --> 47:29.060]  got the Republican leadership saying how dare the Tea Party not want to totally open border
[47:29.060 --> 47:31.800]  and total socialism and to turn their guns in.
[47:31.800 --> 47:35.600]  And you've got Karl Rove out there saying that. And then you've got Karl Rove attacking
[47:35.600 --> 47:41.820]  Alex Jones, now even Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck. Coming out saying these groups are bad,
[47:41.820 --> 47:46.100]  these groups are radical. Let us run things, the new Republican Party, you'll lose if you
[47:46.100 --> 47:49.200]  don't do this, you'll lose if you don't go along with this.
[47:49.200 --> 47:54.780]  And they've got scripted, cuz I know people at WWE, it's all scripted and approved what
[47:54.780 --> 48:00.540]  they say, what they do. It's all choreographed for a full four or five days ahead of time,
[48:00.540 --> 48:07.140]  word for word and approved by the control freak Vince McMahon. So you're seeing scripted
[48:07.140 --> 48:13.220]  every week, Jack Schwagger, we're gonna play some of this after the break.
[48:13.220 --> 48:20.780]  Running around saying, and his manager saying every problem is the Mexicans, which is just
[48:20.780 --> 48:29.100]  obviously ridiculous and racist. America's perfect if it wasn't for the illegal aliens.
[48:29.100 --> 48:34.100]  And mixing the two together. And the commentators are like, yeah, Jack Schwagger gets that Alex
[48:34.100 --> 48:39.460]  Jones fan mail. Limbaugh likes him too. And you're like, well, it's a joke. No, it's not.
[48:39.460 --> 48:44.860]  The viewers out there watching it, mainly illegal aliens, about half their audience,
[48:44.860 --> 48:50.180]  are sitting there really believing it's real. And really believing that I'm sending fan
[48:50.180 --> 48:53.020]  mail to Jack Schwagger.
[48:53.020 --> 48:59.580]  Okay, so, and it's everywhere, it's sitcoms, it's dramas, it's four TV shows demonizing
[48:59.580 --> 49:04.140]  the former founding fathers. And anybody that's a gun owner today saying we're racist, we're
[49:04.140 --> 49:07.700]  killers. If you talk about chemtrails on a drama, you're sick of looking at a nerve gas
[49:07.700 --> 49:08.700]  in New York.
[49:08.700 --> 49:14.020]  And of course, it's not real, but you've got the general public, the yuppies, you got yuppie
[49:14.020 --> 49:18.660]  shows, the hospital shows, you've got the wrestling shows. For every demographic and
[49:18.660 --> 49:24.740]  every demographic is Alex Jones wants to kill cops. Alex Jones likes Christopher Dorner.
[49:24.740 --> 49:30.500]  Alex Jones says America attacked Russia with a meteorite. Alex Jones lied about bullets.
[49:30.500 --> 49:36.240]  Alex Jones hates Mexicans. Alex Jones, you see, who are they attacking? And it's the
[49:36.240 --> 49:43.720]  Republican Party, the Republican Party leadership. I mean, he spent tens of millions. How much
[49:43.720 --> 49:44.900]  does she spend running in the Senate?
[49:44.900 --> 49:51.740]  It was some record number. Is it 50, 60 million? Look up how much McMahon's wife spent on her
[49:51.740 --> 49:55.420]  Senate run for me. I think it's like 60 million or something, my memory serves. The point
[49:55.420 --> 50:00.540]  is, she couldn't even get in. And so now they're just throwing themselves at the power structure's
[50:00.540 --> 50:07.120]  feet. Look, we'll do whatever you say. So now on Mainline TV, nothing has 15 million
[50:07.120 --> 50:11.580]  viewers but the NFL now, 30 million viewers per show.
[50:11.580 --> 50:19.300]  Super Bowl 75 million. She spent 100 million, that's New York Times, excuse me. One, I guess
[50:19.300 --> 50:27.700]  when I saw the last number it was 60, $100 million trying to crawl up the hind end of
[50:27.700 --> 50:31.600]  the New World Order. I mean, this is beyond brown dozing. I'm sorry that's what's going
[50:31.600 --> 50:33.420]  on here, okay?
[50:33.420 --> 50:40.300]  You witch bucket of puss, okay? And I'm telling everybody, boycott the WWE and the rest of
[50:40.300 --> 50:45.740]  it. They are anti-American filth out there trying to imply anybody that wants sovereignty
[50:45.740 --> 50:49.020]  and doesn't want this country bankrupted. The illegal aliens being brought in here to
[50:49.020 --> 50:52.700]  vote take our guns, folks. I'd rather convert them and turn them over to liberty. But let
[50:52.700 --> 50:56.940]  me tell you, that's not happening. The globalists want the illegals here. I don't want them
[50:56.940 --> 51:00.700]  here. It's simple. Globalists are for it, I'm against it.

[51:30.000 --> 51:34.220]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[51:34.220 --> 51:38.420]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes
[51:38.420 --> 51:42.540]  to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[51:42.540 --> 51:45.940]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[51:45.940 --> 51:50.540]  army? Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[54:16.900 --> 54:22.180]  This is meant to demonize anybody that's pro-gun, you name it. And I'm going to get more into
[54:22.180 --> 54:26.940]  world news when we come back and then take your phone calls ahead of our next guest joining
[54:26.940 --> 54:31.220]  us. But you know, aspartame and things really hits Hispanics worse than it hits anybody
[54:31.220 --> 54:34.980]  else the studies show. But nobody's going to care about that in the Hispanic Raza groups
[54:34.980 --> 54:40.440]  about why is everybody dying or how they're sterilizing little Mexican children in Mexico.
[54:40.440 --> 54:45.540]  That's in the news. No, no, no, no, no. It's just learn to hate white people because the
[54:45.540 --> 54:49.760]  globalists want to divide and conquer so they can attack everybody. Let's go to Paul Watson's
[54:49.760 --> 54:56.580]  report on this travesty. Here it is. World Wrestling Entertainment has created an immigrant
[54:56.580 --> 55:03.820]  bashing Bill of Rights loving don't tread on me flag waving racist character who according
[55:03.820 --> 55:13.580]  to WWE commentators receives fan mail from Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck.
[55:13.580 --> 55:19.860]  Jack Swagger and his manager Zeb Coulter appeared on Monday Night Raw last night and were booed
[55:19.860 --> 55:28.140]  by the audience as they talked about the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and illegal immigration.
[55:28.140 --> 55:37.460]  The state of our union is pathetic. But real Americans are not the blame. The blame lies
[55:37.460 --> 55:45.940]  solely on the shoulders of the millions and millions of people living in this country
[55:45.940 --> 55:53.180]  illegally. See, they're meant to discredit things there. Those people live in our country,
[55:53.180 --> 56:01.220]  but they don't have any qualms about taking medical care, taking our jobs, our educations
[56:01.220 --> 56:08.260]  and our freedom. And here on President's Day, I think it's high time that we put a stop
[56:08.260 --> 56:17.460]  to it. So then later in the show, the WWE commentators said that these two racist xenophobic
[56:17.460 --> 56:24.520]  anti-immigrant hate figures received fan mail from none other than Rush Limbaugh, Glenn
[56:24.520 --> 56:41.220]  Beck and Alex Jones.
[56:41.220 --> 56:46.660]  So here was some of the response on Twitter last night. I see the WWE is crapping all
[56:46.660 --> 56:52.940]  over the Tea Party right now with the Jack Swagger gimmick. Here's another one. WWE promoting
[56:52.940 --> 56:59.380]  a racist immigrant hating Tea Party character versus a Mexican wrestler. Unfortunately not
[56:59.380 --> 57:05.380]  an all time low, but top five low point. So Swagger and partner is racist and the match
[57:05.380 --> 57:11.980]  at WrestleMania is against the Mexican. The WWE is back to being racist. The real American
[57:11.980 --> 57:18.740]  against the wealthy Mexican who's fighting for the poor. And it goes on. So the WWE announcers
[57:18.740 --> 57:23.300]  just said Jack Swagger is like Alex Jones and Rush Limbaugh. They had a don't tread
[57:23.300 --> 57:30.540]  on me poster. So everybody was freaking out about this in the aftermath on Twitter. So
[57:30.540 --> 57:37.680]  this is a continuation of the divide and conquer tactic of cultural subversion to manufacture
[57:37.680 --> 57:43.640]  racial division and to characterize the Tea Party, conservatives, libertarians, opponents
[57:43.640 --> 57:51.780]  of uncontrolled illegal immigration and constitutionalists as racist extremist radicals who should be
[57:51.780 --> 57:56.100]  pushed to the fringes of the political discourse.
[57:56.100 --> 58:03.440]  The rest of his video report and more videos up at info-wars.com breaking all of this down.
[58:03.440 --> 58:07.740]  But this is how desperate the system is. They are targeting and trying to create division
[58:07.740 --> 58:13.980]  and it's like this in movies, dramas everywhere. White people are bad. Anyone else is good.
[58:13.980 --> 58:18.060]  Gun owning southerners. Well, I mean, you've got wrangle. So we've got to overcome southerners
[58:18.060 --> 58:23.220]  in the Constitution. So see, white people are taught your bads and whites are like you're
[58:23.220 --> 58:24.220]  right.
[58:24.220 --> 58:26.980]  So they're beating themselves over the head with a baseball bat. I'm scum, I'm filth.
[58:26.980 --> 58:30.820]  And the system's like, by the way, we're in a race. We're gonna take over. You're gonna
[58:30.820 --> 58:34.860]  take that scumbag. That's right. And they script it. And it's put out by rich white
[58:34.860 --> 58:38.780]  Republicans who want to gut this country. Vince the Trader McMahon.
[58:38.780 --> 58:51.060]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:51.060 --> 58:55.260]  Your freedoms are on the line. The Second Amendment is in danger. How soon before your

[59:05.500 --> 59:10.340]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply. Don't be dependent. Be
[59:10.340 --> 59:14.820]  self-sufficient. Don't wait for the government to feed you. Feed yourself. I can warn you,
[59:14.820 --> 59:19.860]  but I can't feed you. Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from e Foods Direct.

[59:53.420 --> 01:00:05.180]  Aging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:12.260]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:21.020]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:31.780]  All right, here's what's going to happen. I'm going to news blitz through a bunch of
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:36.060]  headlines, which means I'll get to about two or three and then stop on one in the next
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:39.620]  segment. Then we're going to take some phone calls and Wayne Madsen's popping in for about
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:46.140]  20 minutes. Then I'll continue with calls. Then Max Kaiser's joining us. Amazing. Google
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:52.700]  passes $800 billion in total value.
[01:00:52.700 --> 01:01:00.140]  Government pink slips printed as Congress vacations. Daring mega heist nets $500 million
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:06.900]  in raw diamonds. Another business visited by Obama closes. Changes in tax structure,
[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:11.660]  creating angst among low, middle class. Well, yeah, it's designed to get rid of them, make
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:15.220]  the poor even poorer, get rid of the middle class. Because Obama's a nice guy. I mean,
[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:22.420]  he's not racist. He's part, only half of him's racist. He's half white. But still, he wouldn't
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:23.700]  lie to you because he's liberal.
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:29.540]  I mean, he's USDA to illegal aliens. Don't worry, food stamps won't affect citizenship
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:35.540]  chances. Can I go to Mexico and get some food stamps? No, but I'm a racist. I don't even
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:39.860]  have a right to speak. I mean, whites are the devil. Update, Russian foreign minister
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:45.220]  finally takes Kerry's call. We're getting to all that. Kremlin accuses Texas mother
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:48.340]  of killing adopted son.
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:53.780]  Son trashes Ted Turner in race. That's amazing. Of course, I'm reading off the Drudge Report.
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:58.860]  The really important news is Robert Plant hints he's open to Zeppelin reunion. How are
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:02.860]  you gonna do that without John Bonham?
[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:10.380]  Jason Bonham. Well, you're John Bonham. We'll call him Jason Bonham. Yeah, John Bonham's
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:17.300]  son. By the way, Robert Plant hints he's open to Zeppelin reunion. See, they're talking
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:22.180]  to me sometimes. That's why you'll hear me talking to myself. Perhaps I'm crazy. Perhaps
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:23.620]  I need Prozac.
[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:32.320]  So that's some of the news up at TheMightyDrudgeReport.com. Look at this headline. Man burned to death
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:40.620]  may have spontaneously combusted. And of course, Drudge was linked yesterday to our article
[01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:47.180]  about the announcement that yes, we're gonna have drones for quote, public safety reasons.
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:52.660]  I like the surveillance cameras are for public safety.
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:58.540]  The TSA dragging your two year old away to a private room for personal inspection. That's
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:07.620]  for public safety, ladies and gentlemen. So that's just some of the news that is up at
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:15.680]  DrudgeReport.com. Also, Colorado College advises vomiting or urinating to stop rapists. That's
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:22.020]  actually better than scissors. But I guess the liberals that wrote those policies think
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:28.740]  that normal people are as neurotic as them and can just vomit on command. That does sound
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:33.980]  like some whacked out authoritarian that calls himself a liberal who can projectile vomit
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:37.700]  on command like a semi-automatic vomit machine.
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:42.900]  You're trying to rape me like you're a bird or something and you just vomit on somebody.
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:48.520]  What about Homeland Security? If someone starts shooting up your house or business, fight
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:55.140]  them off with scissors. Scissors are okay, see, cuz that can't fight a tyrannical government.
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:04:01.480]  Guns for self-defense, not good. Plus, Senator John Allen retiring, was nominee for NATO
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:06.180]  Supreme Allied Commander Post. Yeah, they're purging the military at about one top brass
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:08.220]  a week.
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:13.580]  And of course, you saw the last SecDef nominee, Hagel, saying that the military is not following
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:18.480]  Obama's orders and isn't under their new world order control. And the media, the left media
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:23.660]  spun that like, that means they're war hawks and Obama can't control them. No, no, it's
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:24.920]  the opposite.
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:29.300]  They don't wanna attack Iran. They don't wanna be arming Al-Qaeda. They've been saying no
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:34.820]  to all these new wars. They've been saying no to false flags. That's the real scoop,
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:42.940]  scoop. Okay, we're gonna come back and get into all of Obama's golfing, cuz you need
[01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:46.180]  to work harder so you can pay more taxes to the foreign banks.
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:50.700]  All right, we are going to come back here. And there's also another report I need to
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:55.100]  get to at dovetails, the mainstream news admitting the sweeteners are hurting people, the artificial
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:05:00.940]  sweeteners about TV dumbing kids down. Stay with us.
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:05.660]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms. But if you don't have a home security
[01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:10.420]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When

[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:31.460]  live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. There are mysterious deaths taking place not just
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:36.460]  here in the United States but all over the world. Assassinations, fake suicides, you
[01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:42.860]  name it. Breitbartisms. Police hunt for two men after oil chief, the European head of
[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:48.940]  Exxon Mobil, executed in the streets of the Brussels capital. And we're gonna talk about
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:54.540]  how that ties into author and former intelligence contract pilot accused in murder or suicide.
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:59.020]  That's their favorite way to kill you and your family and then blame it on you. Absolutely
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:06.740]  the height of total wickedness. That way they demonize whoever they assassinate as well.
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:10.060]  That is just some of what we're gonna be covering. I already got into this some but it shows
[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:15.580]  how desperate the system's getting. WWE, that's one of the biggest TV events out there other
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:24.340]  than NFL, has a guy that tries to discredit the Tea Party, Jack Swagger, and then his
[01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:32.140]  manager saying basically that if you don't have open borders you're a racist.
[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:36.860]  That's basically they come out and put out ridiculous debates that are pro Tea Party
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:42.500]  winning to demonize the Tea Party. And again, that's a big Republican outfit broadcast on
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:47.140]  Fox Television and Sky Television in Europe. And it's all tied to the Republican Party
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:51.680]  and Karl Rove to demonize, well, Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh, and Glenn Beck. They have these
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:57.780]  guys say horrible things and then talk about what fans they are of Alex Jones, Glenn Beck,
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:09:58.780]  and Rush Limbaugh.
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:04.440]  It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's done for propaganda purposes. WWE creates racist
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:10.700]  wrestler to demonize Tea Party. Prominent American scientist calls for eco-dictatorship
[01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:17.220]  worldwide under UN rule. A city of LA targets infowars over illegally posted signs. This
[01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:20.900]  is a very important article cuz it shows the end of due process.
[01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:25.340]  And you won't believe who's getting away with paying zero taxes. All the middle class gets
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:30.860]  hammered. All the big money is tax exempt. And then they lobby, gee, us rich people don't
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:35.260]  pay enough taxes. Better raise them cuz they get your money in banker bailout and corporate
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:36.260]  welfare.
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:43.300]  Maryland County bans gun shows, pretty amazing information. TSA screeners continue to lie
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:48.420]  to passengers about legality of recording at checkpoints. And another big article, Democrats
[01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:54.100]  introduced bill to allow police to search homes of gun owners in Seattle. Well, for
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:57.340]  the state of Washington itself.
[01:10:57.340 --> 01:11:02.140]  And it just shows how draconian it is. 15, 16 states now have bills introduced, Democratic
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:06.660]  Party supporting them, to physically ban all semi-autos. But they're saying, hey, nobody
[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:10.420]  wants your guns. It's a conspiracy theory. Don't read the fine print. Trust us, we're
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:13.580]  nice people. We're liberals. We're liberals.
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:19.020]  Never mind those drones, never mind the checkpoints, never mind we just bought. They're now reporting,
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:25.460]  I'm sorry, I said 1.75 billion. That was the latest numbers I had. I hadn't added all the
[01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:30.740]  purchases up. WorldNetDaily and Breitbart have. It's over and I went and looked at it,
[01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:31.740]  it's true.
[01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:38.660]  It's 2 billion plus in the last just year. It's not counting what they bought in 2011.
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:44.980]  So I've been underestimating, I apologize. Of course, the media says I made it up, there's
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:49.700]  no bullets. And they have fine print that I'm correct, but still I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:57.100]  It'd be like if somebody walked up and gave you 100 karat diamond for free and it turned
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:00.940]  out it was a real diamond. You just say, it's not real and throw it in the ditch. That's
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:02.700]  kind of how it works.
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:06.900]  Let me go over some of this other news. I've told you this about 100 times, but here it
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:14.580]  is. Childhood TV addicts more likely to commit crime, major study shows out of New Zealand,
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:22.420]  the University of Otago tracked 1,000 children born in the 70s through to today. And they
[01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:27.580]  found that much more likely to be involved in crime, violent, mental illness, you name
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:28.860]  it.
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:34.580]  And the reason that is, they don't know why, really all the simulated violence and murder
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:40.020]  and killing, they're not real people to a great extent. They're biological programmed
[01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:45.220]  androids as the globalist in the 40s said they would do with TV. You can read the books
[01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:49.540]  written, I think one of them is the five arguments for the abolition of television.
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:54.180]  I read that book many years ago, I was at the four arguments, exposing how it was done.
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:58.980]  Bernays talked about it. I mean, it's on record that it's not even so much the medium, that's
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:04.500]  part of it, that it's a spectator thing. But you just start seeing everything is not real.
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:08.540]  And then through that medium, the murders, the death, the killings. I mean, there's a
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:16.620]  reason almost every mass shooter has been a white, goth, devil worshipper, shoot them
[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:18.940]  up first person video game head.
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:25.460]  And I'm not persecuting goths. I'm not saying you're all guilty. I'm saying in a profile,
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:34.620]  can you argue with the fact? They're programmed by the goth, devil, vampire, death culture
[01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:43.580]  that permeates the last 20 years. That's artificially force fed. It's artificially force fed. And
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:46.580]  they played first person shoot them ups, they get depressed.
[01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:50.660]  They're unhappy. They're not climbing hills. They're not getting in fistfights. They're
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:59.700]  not catching fish. They're not whitewater rafting down the rapids. They're not getting
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:05.420]  turned down by a girl, but getting accepted by a girl. They're not going through adversity.
[01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:09.500]  They're not going to even, I even respect gangs that go to old fashioned gang street
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:10.500]  fights.
[01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:14.060]  At least it's something real. Not that I ever was a part of anything like that. But the
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:22.860]  point is, is that they've never lived in the real world, ladies and gentlemen. And so they
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:29.820]  are absolutely disconnected from reality. And so the only reality is mass shootings,
[01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:37.940]  death, murder, blood, Satanism, Harris, Kleibold, Lanza. About nine out of ten times, I've only
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:43.620]  found a few where they're not, they are into nihilistic death cult vampirism.
[01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:46.800]  Hitler loving. And they're like, well, these kids were Jewish. Why do they love Hitler?
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:50.700]  Cuz it's the worst thing. It's like preacher's daughters are well known to be the wildest
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:54.580]  thing you could ever imagine. It's the old joke of, yeah, I just moved to this small
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:59.460]  town. I wanna find a hot date. I'm gonna go to church.
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:03.460]  My dad used to tell me about that when I was a kid and I didn't believe him. That's amazing.
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:08.220]  You can go pick the preacher's daughter up in about 30 seconds. And it's like the Jewish
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:13.340]  kids are into Hitler. The preacher's daughters into doing crazy things in the backseat of
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:14.340]  the car.
[01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:20.180]  But the issue is, is that that's what's happening. These aren't real people anymore. They're
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:25.140]  just programmed by what's the most shocking, what's the most evil, what thrills them. They're
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:31.700]  attracted to darkness. They're attracted to evil. And I mean, I'm profiling where this
[01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:32.700]  comes from.
[01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:36.700]  I mean, there's profiles, there's archetypes that the media programs. White kids, you're
[01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:41.820]  gonna be into vampires and goth and the occult. Hispanic kids, you're gonna be into hating
[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:46.580]  white people who are the racist and the worst people on Earth. Black kids, you're gonna
[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:53.460]  be into gang banging and killing each other. Asian kids, you're gonna be into computer
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:54.460]  programming.
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:59.500]  I mean, the media is literally trying to put people into these boxes in these programmed
[01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:02.620]  areas. I said I would give the number out and take calls, but what's the point? I don't
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:06.020]  even know if I'll get to your calls if I do. Let me continue here with some of the other
[01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:11.580]  headlines. That's just one article out of literally about 150.
[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:19.140]  New Red Link, DHS supplier provides shooting targets of American gun owners. Whoa, whoa,
[01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:24.900]  I wish Watson would have called me when he learned this. Holy mackerel, company produces
[01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:30.060]  cardboard cutouts of non-traditional threats, pregnant women, elderly and children.
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:35.820]  See, I told you the Marines and Army would do these urban warfare drills where they practice
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:42.140]  shooting. Wow, wow, they're really getting ready. Where they practice shooting human
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:49.800]  waves of US citizens mainly dressed as Southerners, as rednecks, white urban people are okay.
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:57.460]  It's white rural must be killed. And I noticed that they use the zombie motif as a cover
[01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:04.060]  and now they have huge mass fire drills where the Army and the Marines, but also naval security
[01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:10.660]  and Air Force security practice mowing people down in John Deere hats and overalls, but
[01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:13.940]  dressed up like zombies, so then it's okay.
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:21.260]  And the media goes, they're having fun, they're practicing killing zombies. But now they're
[01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:27.940]  being given non-traditional threats for the police of a little boy with a gun and a pregnant
[01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:31.320]  woman. I'll never forget the Homeland Security AP, right after Homeland Security got set
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:36.860]  up in 2002. They said, in our training, we train them that priests can't be trusted or
[01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:40.820]  pregnant women or men wearing blue jeans or who have cell phones.
[01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:48.300]  A mother with her child, no more hesitation, young mother on playground, kill her. Guys,
[01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:51.780]  print this for me. This is just, see, I already knew this was going on. You know what? You
[01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:59.220]  just handed it to me. I've got to get Watson. A mother in her, or a middle aged woman in
[01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:05.860]  her robe in the bathroom, or is that the garage?
[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:10.200]  I got to call Watson. He probably has it in there, he's so sharp. But he should point
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:14.660]  out they're now doing zombie killing raids again. And then we can put links to police
[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:19.300]  at 2000 where it wasn't zombies. And folks are like, you're practicing mowing down unarmed
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:26.220]  people who are rushing you with signs saying you can't take my guns or I want food.
[01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:35.580]  No more hesitation, young school aged girl, NMH 6. Yeah, see, that's to train cops in
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:39.980]  instinctive shooting where you don't think. See, video games got developed by the Pentagon
[01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:43.580]  in the 60s cuz about half the troops wouldn't kill somebody up close.
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:47.460]  And if you don't kill somebody up close, you become dead marine, to quote Full Metal Jacket.
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:55.460]  You must hone your killer instinct. You must kill him before he kills you. The old good
[01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:59.540]  old boy with the 12 gauge shot. I love how all these people are white, good, good. Well,
[01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:02.380]  you will know who needs to be dealt with, I mean, it's the white people.
[01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:07.860]  The new white al-Qaeda. All the training videos is minorities, who are the majority now, reporting
[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:17.340]  on the whites, the whites. And now Jan Napolitano says, the number one threat is white people.
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:23.300]  It's white gun owners, it's not al-Qaeda. Global is running them now, it's white people.
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:29.260]  They're going to kill us. Look at that evil lady. I mean, that is an evil white lady.
[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:34.740]  Can we see more of the evil whites, please? My gosh, man, I tell you, these will be popular
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:39.540]  at the, evil white man. Good, get rid of him immediately, no more hesitation. The little
[01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:43.820]  white kid, nothing worse than a little white kid, woo, woo.
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:52.820]  I hate white kids. There's nothing good. Fill them full of lead. Yosemite Sam is gonna commit
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:59.580]  suicide. He's white and everybody knows he's bad. Well, he'll burn down the orphanage and
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:03.260]  shut down the old lady's home. Your freedoms are on the line. The Second
[01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:07.900]  Amendment is in danger. How soon before your freedoms are taken away? What can you not
[01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:12.900]  live without? What is your greatest dependency? Is it your guns? Is it your home? No, it's
[01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:18.300]  food. It all boils down to the food supply. Tyrannical governments control people by controlling

[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:34.360]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric engraving embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:38.820]  then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service
[01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:42.580]  debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:46.300]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army? Hi, Ted
[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:50.140]  Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:06.080]  Hey there, Frank Bates here. Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:12.180]  280 million Americans? This is really scary stuff. Defense experts warn that this odd
[01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:17.460]  device poses the greatest threat we've ever known. In fact, just a few weeks ago, former
[01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:21.540]  Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op ed piece for the Washington Post warning
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:26.360]  about this deadly threat. I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:31.080]  It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up. That's why my friend
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:37.180]  just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors
[01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:43.460]  off a conspiracy. Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover exactly
[01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:48.420]  what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:53.540]  attack. I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com before
[01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:58.420]  it's gone forever. Again, that's weirddevice.com.
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:10.340]  See, everybody keeps wondering why every one of these mass shooters has been a first person
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:15.860]  shooter video game addict in every case. And they've been on serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:21.860]  or other psychotropic drugs. You mix those things together. They then people didn't give
[01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:26.500]  into the prevailing youth culture of devil worship and destruction, and then they think
[01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:29.460]  it's really cool to go kill little kids.
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:32.940]  And then you've got other cases where it's not a goth, but more of a drugged out person
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:39.180]  they're using as a graduate student who's got a DARPA mind control $30,000 a year grant.
[01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:43.500]  And then that, of course, is the Batman event. And the media goes, why does Jones keep connecting
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:48.480]  the shootings to the Batman after the fact and finding clues like Sandy Hook? We said
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:53.740]  before the movie came out that it was going to be a trigger for events.
[01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:58.780]  I recognize programming when I see it. People say, well, how do you know? It's like an eye
[01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:03.280]  of somebody who's into horses. There's only a few of these guys out there who can go and
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:08.500]  tell you that's the stud horse you wanna use or that's the horse you wanna race. They're
[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:10.300]  like, well, how do you know that?
[01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:14.740]  I watched him. He's never been in a race before. We were gonna use him for stud. I'm telling
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:20.260]  you have that horse in there. And they will tell us why. I can't tell you why. I've learned
[01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:26.420]  the enemy. And everybody's been like the last few years, why does the military practice
[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:30.260]  repelling zombie attacks and official drills?
[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:35.380]  Because they know you're weak minded and the troops are weak minded. And it's conditioning
[01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:43.900]  to mow down groups of unarmed Americans and to dehumanize us. And you're like, wow, yeah,
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:47.540]  doesn't that make sense? Of course, that's what it is. Because I know the whole psychology
[01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:52.860]  behind it. I'm not smart, folks. I've studied these people.
[01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:57.860]  That's what's so frustrating is that they, in the 60s, they had pop up targets for the
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:03.500]  troops of okay, enemy, okay, non enemy, okay, to try to get them to instinctively shoot
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:12.560]  from playing a game with a real firearm in a reactive situation going through a building.
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:16.500]  So that when they went out to have a real firefight and the enemy popped up, they just
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:24.420]  saw a helmet, you kill them. Now, they have been trying to get everybody ready to just
[01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:26.240]  kill the average American.
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:30.500]  So I've been to the urban warfare drills since 1997. Let's not exaggerate, I've probably
[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:35.560]  been to 25 drills or so. I've had footage sent to me from hundreds. I made four films
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:44.020]  about them. And the Army and the Marines train with special units to test and create the
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:48.260]  leadership who were then sheep dipped out to be cops, police chiefs, and others a decade
[01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:49.260]  later.
[01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:54.380]  We've tracked this pattern to who will kill people dressed up like my grandfather dressed
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:27:00.540]  on the farm. Overalls, coveralls, John Deere hat, this is America, you can't, they take
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:05.780]  them down. They line them up, they shoot them. And Marines that say, I'm not gonna do this.
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:11.060]  Well, they're just transferred out to hardcore combat and got a big vaccine lineup for you.
[01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:15.500]  Hope you enjoy getting enough shots to kill an elephant. Bye bye, Sergeant Johnson.
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:23.820]  Yeah, of course, those taking part of it don't even see the compartmentalization, okay?
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:29.540]  And then they've created their giant army to do this, Brigade Homeland, which is a 378,000
[01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:34.140]  auxiliary force, that's Army Times, three years ago. Look it up, Brigade Homeland starts
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:35.140]  here.
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:40.100]  What is it, November 1st is the headline. And how they plan to beef it up to 370 plus
[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:48.300]  thousand by 2013. And now we're 2013, well, that was 2011 or 2010, they said that. And
[01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:54.300]  now the big, this isn't some little site. This is Law Enforcement Targets Inc, which
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:59.940]  counts themselves as one of the largest sellers of targets, industrial level. And look at
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:03.060]  the targets here.
[01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:08.360]  No more hesitation, pregnant woman threat. Punch this up for people here. Company produces
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:17.460]  cardboard cutouts of non-traditional threats, pregnant women, elderly, and children. Or
[01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:22.340]  we can punch it up on infoawards.com if the computer isn't working. A provider of realistic
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:26.060]  shooting targets, the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies for their
[01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:30.660]  1.6, I'm sorry, now it's 2 billion bullets, has created a line of non-traditional threat
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:34.220]  targets that include pregnant women, mothers in playgrounds.
[01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:39.160]  Guys, go have Weldon right now order a bunch of these. I wanna order a bunch of these right
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:44.820]  now for the shooting show as we can go illustrate this. And elderly American gun owners, I gotta
[01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:49.620]  take them out. Law Enforcement Targets Inc is a 21-year designer and full service provider
[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:53.900]  of training targets for the DHS, the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:56.740]  And of course, and other law enforcement agencies throughout the country, yeah, you don't want
[01:28:56.740 --> 01:29:02.540]  a Taliban figure, a bank robber figure, a bad guy figure. No, no, no, no. The guy with
[01:29:02.540 --> 01:29:06.380]  a scruffy beard with a gun out to a little kid, no, no, no, no. So you practice shooting
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:08.540]  him in the head, no, no, no, it's your grandpa.
[01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:13.140]  It's a pregnant woman, learn how to kill a pregnant woman. To Pavlovian, have instinctive
[01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:20.380]  shooting so that when you see the woman, you kill her. And of course, targets have always
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:26.220]  been about who are we demonizing? The famous Osama bin Laden targets. Well, now it's the
[01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:31.500]  pregnant woman. And don't worry, every single one of these evil people is white.
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:35.180]  And that's the most important part about all the new Homeland Security videos. The training
[01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:40.140]  videos are everyone is white as a terrorist. Everyone who's not white is the good guy reporting
[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:44.500]  them. And you've got all the TV shows to back it up, the dramas where the terrorists are
[01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:50.060]  white gun owners and the WWE, says Alex Jones is an evil white person as well.
[01:29:50.060 --> 01:30:00.860]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:13.140]  foretold in 1984 has become reality. It really says that the state is God. The United States
[01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:18.500]  is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth. This film
[01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:24.760]  conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:28.940]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all

[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:12.740]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening
[01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:21.100]  to Alex Jones.
[01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:28.140]  The United States and the rest of the world is literally bathed in anti-human, anti-family
[01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:35.180]  division and propaganda. And the establishment is fully trying to declare the Tea Party discredited,
[01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:39.780]  demonized, destroyed. Because even though it's not been perfect, it was founded really
[01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:44.300]  by Ron Paul, myself and others. And taken over by the Republicans, they tried to infiltrate
[01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:45.300]  it.
[01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:49.740]  They have failed and it's getting a lot of constitutionalists elected to Congress who
[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:55.820]  are pro-constitution and even anti-war. In the case of people like Walter Jones, who's
[01:33:55.820 --> 01:34:00.660]  really woken up. And so you've got Karl Rove, the whole system coming after it. And that's
[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:06.380]  why you've got CNN, WWE Wrestling run by the McMahons, Republicans. You've got Karl Rove
[01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:12.460]  all over Fox, Fox broadcasting WWE Wrestling, demonizing myself.
[01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:19.420]  But even Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck saying we're racist. And then the Mexican with the
[01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:24.500]  Mexican flag defeats our champion. This is meant to create division just like they have
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:30.140]  prisons set up along racial lines to control the population. America and the rest of the
[01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:32.380]  world is becoming one giant prison.
[01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:38.100]  That's why we say prisonplanet.com. But this new DHS supplier provides shooting targets
[01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:43.020]  of American gun owners. Company produces cardboard cutouts of non-traditional threats. Pregnant
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:48.140]  women, old men, farmers who've got to be killed by the police. And again, paper targets of
[01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:52.340]  images were created in the 40s to create instinctive shooting.
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:59.420]  And by the 60s, video games to make people not hesitate and kill. Cuz they can't move
[01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:04.220]  to combat robots on the ground quick enough. And then and all the aircraft being combat
[01:35:04.220 --> 01:35:08.020]  drones where you're just killing a blip on a screen. So before they get to that point,
[01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:13.860]  they need to dehumanize and prepare for the new domestic ground war that Homeland Security
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:17.780]  has been pushing with now over 2 billion bullets.
[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:23.260]  Now we're gonna talk about very mysterious murders and murder suicides. And the fact
[01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:28.140]  that now within minutes of Breitbart being killed, they said, it's natural causes when
[01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:33.380]  no doctor had ever said that. And he wasn't even cold yet, less than an hour after he
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:37.700]  died. They killed so many people. I'm gonna talk about a moment with Wayne Madsen, Pulitzer
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:41.740]  Prize winners exposing things that this is how they'll kill me.
[01:35:41.740 --> 01:35:46.620]  And I will never commit suicide. I will never hurt my family. I barely even over the years
[01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:52.580]  spanked my children. And I would never even enter my mind in a trillion years. But the
[01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:56.980]  thing they do is they kill you and they kill your family. And they're doing this more and
[01:35:56.980 --> 01:36:01.060]  more. And so we're gonna be talking about that with former NSA officer and syndicated
[01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:06.060]  columnist Wayne Madsen and WayneMadsenReport.com here in just a moment.
[01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:13.460]  Wow, there is so much to get to here. Briefly, this broadcast is listener supported. That

[01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:07.740]  We are the best there is. Doesn't mean we're that great. But we are the best there is.
[01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:15.740]  And that means we've got a very serious responsibility to fight the globalists as hard as we can.
[01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:20.340]  Plus, they could kill me anytime. And I don't think that'll happen because of your prayers
[01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:25.220]  and because of the fact I'm so vocal and clear about all this. But they don't care. They'll
[01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:31.740]  burn down Dorner's cabin and say, we're gonna burn that house down. Yes, ring the fire,
[01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:32.740]  we're gonna burn it down.
[01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:38.580]  Okay, the burner's replaced, it's lit. Okay, it's on fire, okay, we burned it down. And
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:42.380]  then say, we never said that, you're a conspiracy theorist. And that it's supporting Dorner
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:46.460]  to say they executed him. So that they could do anything. I mean, they could blow my head
[01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:48.340]  off on national TV and said I did it.
[01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:52.860]  And Obama could do it. They'd say, he could blow my head off and then say, I did not blow
[01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:58.140]  his head off. On national TV, on the stage at the Super Bowl, he could blow my head off
[01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:03.780]  and then say, Alex just blew his own head off and killed his family.
[01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:09.220]  That's the level of mind control that some of the public is under. And they're trying
[01:39:09.220 --> 01:39:14.300]  to get to that lawless point where they can do whatever they want. Gary Webb, six months
[01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:17.980]  before he died, I'd had him on a few times to pull a surprise winner. And I called him
[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:22.300]  up cuz I was doing my own producing at the time, setting up in radio.
[01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:26.740]  It's not like in TV, the producer owns the show and finances it. In radio, the producer
[01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:33.060]  sets up the guests basically. And I was producing my own show. And I called him up and he said,
[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:37.580]  yeah, listen, I don't wanna come on for about six months. My book's gonna come out that
[01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:40.100]  totally proves government drug dealing.
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:43.620]  They tried to discredit me and stuff, but I never backed down my Pulitzer Prize in the
[01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:47.580]  Dark Alliance. And then he talked to some of his friends and family who I was talking
[01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:51.580]  to about a film. They're like, yeah, Gary's really freaked out right now. He caught guys
[01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:56.060]  climbing out of his house, special forces types, sliding down from the second floor,
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:40:00.620]  commando style on the water drains, definitely special ops.
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:05.260]  He's getting threats, but he's gonna get this book out. And about a month before the book
[01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:10.740]  came out, they shot him twice in the head. And the police instantly said, he killed himself,
[01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:14.940]  here's the suicide note. Same thing with the DC Madam, fake suicide note. I haven't got
[01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:19.380]  a copy of her handwriting, wasn't even close, okay?
[01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:23.300]  The Arkin sighting with Fannie Malick where people be shot 15 times, you have their arms
[01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:29.580]  and legs cut off and he'd rule it a suicide. Little kids killed, and he'd rule it, little
[01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:34.180]  kids with gunshot wounds in them and lay on railroad tracks. Cuz of Mina, Arkansas, and
[01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:38.260]  I've interviewed the people that were there.
[01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:45.700]  The guy that wrote the book about it, Terry Reed, who was there and witnessed the government,
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:49.420]  the cocaine, and Bill Clinton, and the aircraft, and all the rest of it there at Mina. And
[01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:53.340]  he's only alive cuz he wrote a book. And he waited, got it out, kept quiet till the book
[01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:54.340]  came out.
[01:40:54.340 --> 01:41:00.140]  So we're in a business here of defending liberty that is absolute life and death. I mean, I
[01:41:00.140 --> 01:41:04.540]  want you to understand, this isn't a game. Wayne Madsen, he worked at the NSA, he does
[01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:09.540]  the Capitol beat in national security. You see him on C-SPAN a lot, National Press Club.
[01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:12.820]  He had to leave last year for about three or four months because he was told by his
[01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:15.220]  government sources they've got a head out on you.
[01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:19.980]  And just by going public and then leaving for that window, that protected him. And I've
[01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:25.500]  had people call up, just to be clear how real the new world order is, myself and my wife,
[01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:30.420]  and tell us things we were just talking about so they know it's serious. This happened to
[01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:35.140]  me three or four times, happened to her three or four times, actually more than that.
[01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:40.100]  And it's just like a movie. They'll go, you were just talking about this with your mother.
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:44.500]  Now, do you understand? I'll cut your frickin' head off, you understand, you bitch. We're
[01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:49.380]  gonna kill you and your family. I mean, that's the kind of stuff this is. That's who runs
[01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:54.620]  this country, okay? With special ops designed to scare you as much as they can.
[01:41:54.620 --> 01:42:00.620]  Now, that little dog's in the backyard, I'd like to chop your head off, bitch, okay? And
[01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:05.740]  you're like, they see my dog, they know my dog, they're listening right now, okay? I
[01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:10.100]  hope your dad dies in the hospital. They like to call too, you've had a tragedy, they're
[01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:12.100]  trying to cause a chain reaction.
[01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:18.300]  That's who runs America. Let's just stop being naive about this, okay? People that make Linda
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:24.480]  Blair look like a sweetie cake run the country, okay? People with a direct line to Beelzebub
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:28.420]  run the country. They run Al-Qaeda, they run the New World Order. Look at the television,
[01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:31.860]  everything wholesome they demonize, everything evil they promote.
[01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:36.020]  Abortion is a right. It's so wonderful, let's chop up some babies. Now, that said, we're
[01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:38.780]  gonna have Wayne for five minutes the next hour, then Max Keiser. Let me give you the
[01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:45.500]  background on this. Document cam shot police. Former airline pilot and conspiracy theorist.
[01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:50.060]  See, it's okay, cuz he's a conspiracy theorist. He didn't trust the government, he wrote a
[01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:53.660]  book. He worked as a contract pilot for Black Ops.
[01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:57.900]  Again, that's why they had government people, the mainstream admits, take everything out
[01:42:57.900 --> 01:43:02.560]  of his house after he was dead. National security came and took everything out of the house.
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:07.260]  Former airline pilot and conspiracy theorist shot dead his two teenage children and his
[01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:10.980]  dog before turning the gun on himself, cuz the police say so.
[01:43:10.980 --> 01:43:14.920]  The neighbors all say he was great and super nice and didn't even keep his gun loaded,
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:20.540]  and said he was being followed because of his book, The Big Bamboozle, Philip Marshall,
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:25.580]  about Saudi Arabian intelligence tied into the US government carrying out 9-11. Which
[01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:29.620]  is admitted, I've had the head of the US Embassy on who said they were ordered springman to
[01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:33.680]  let the head of the visa unit, let him in because they were really CIA agents.
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:37.140]  They were trained at US bases. I talked to Colonel Marshall, the Defense Language School.
[01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:43.980]  He said all I know is Muhammad had a train in my class. And he believed he was in danger
[01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:48.180]  and he told people I'll never commit suicide. And then look at his sweet little kids. Can
[01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:54.700]  you guys document Cam this or actually punch it up? Yeah, sweet, beautiful, wonderful children,
[01:43:54.700 --> 01:43:55.860]  loving kind eyes.
[01:43:55.860 --> 01:44:00.620]  He has loving kind eyes, dead, not enough. You didn't wanna kill him down the street.
[01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:05.420]  You wanted to discredit his book. Just like a drone, Obama says they can kill 200 people
[01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:09.300]  at a wedding to get one bad guy, they claim. Well, it's the same thing, collateral damage.
[01:44:09.300 --> 01:44:12.900]  You're gonna kill Haji's all day to humanize them. How about the little redhead girl and
[01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:18.140]  her brother? Let's grease them. I bet they begged before you splattered their brains
[01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:20.260]  all over the place after you'd already killed daddy.
[01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:25.260]  I bet they screamed and cried, cuz the good guys run America. Such good guys. Let's show
[01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:28.580]  him mowing the yard with his son. This is what they do. They come to your house and
[01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:35.400]  they grease you and your family. Isn't that, Joe, look at him with his baby son there.
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:39.620]  Cuz this guy knew too much. He flew and he was in Black Ops. And he was starting to speak
[01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:45.460]  out. So it's not enough to kill him. No, let's kill his family too, excuse me.
[01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:50.180]  And then that ties into this article. Police hunt two men after oil chief assassinated
[01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:56.200]  in Brussels. And within minutes of the ExxonMobil head of Europe, involved in all the big green
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:45:01.500]  energy stuff, that's probably why he was killed, cuz that's a big scam. The head of it, men
[01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:06.660]  on motorcycles are waiting. They shoot him twice in the head, he hits the ground.
[01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:11.540]  They make sure he's dead. They jump on motorcycles and speed away. And the police say, we think
[01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:16.820]  it was just a mugging, even though they stole nothing. Precision assassination. Don't kill
[01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:20.620]  the wife, just punch her, cuz they weren't paid to kill her. Probably police department
[01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:24.820]  or people working for them, cuz the real hit teams are usually on police departments.
[01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:28.900]  I give you Wayne Madsen on WayneMadsenReport.com. I know I'm ranting here, sir. You've got the
[01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:33.380]  floor till we go to break. What is going on with these cases in the background? Cuz there's
[01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:37.540]  not many folks out there that experienced this. You and I worked for the DC madam, you
[01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:41.500]  warned her, I warned her. We've interviewed a lot of people who end up dead. You get the
[01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.060]  death threats, I get the death threats.
[01:45:43.060 --> 01:45:46.140]  The audience out there doesn't understand, this is real, Wayne Madsen.
[01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:52.380]  Well, I went out to Calaveras County, Alex, very skeptical about what the police said.
[01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:58.720]  In this case, Calaveras County Sheriff. Coming back, there is absolutely no way that this
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:05.380]  man, Phil Marshall, killed his two kids, his 17-year-old son, his 14-year-old daughter
[01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:17.580]  himself, and his little pet Shih Tzu dog, Suki. All dead, a single gunshot shot to each.
[01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:24.740]  Marshall was in the left side of his head. Police said even before they had finished
[01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:31.600]  investigating the case, they permitted professional cleaners to come into the Marshall home to
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:37.740]  clean the premises. After that, there were two sets of vehicles seen at the Marshall
[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:43.860]  home, still conducting the investigation after the home was professionally cleaned.
[01:46:43.860 --> 01:46:47.600]  Now, this guy's background in black ops, I mean, I think that's why they were so scared
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:48.600]  of him.
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:56.940]  Yeah, he worked out of Lakefront Airport before joining Eastern Airlines in the early 80s.
[01:46:56.940 --> 01:47:06.140]  He worked with Barry Seal, the DEA, CIA courier turned informant who was brutally shot to
[01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:14.020]  death multiple times, shot multiple times in his car in Baton Rouge on February 19th,
[01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:23.980]  1986. Seal was getting ready to testify about CIA drug money and cocaine smuggling and arms
[01:47:23.980 --> 01:47:29.140]  smuggling, and they found in the trunk of Barry Seal's car the private phone number,
[01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:33.620]  of course, of then Vice President George H. W. Bush.
[01:47:33.620 --> 01:47:41.020]  Phil Marshall was Seal's pilot after the government revoked Seal's pilot's license. He flew him
[01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:48.140]  around and I found a photograph of a very young Phil Marshall, probably about 24, 25,
[01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:54.500]  standing next to the CIA Learjet parked at Mina, Arkansas.
[01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:58.540]  So they were really worried, this guy put out a 9-11 truth book, really fingering the
[01:47:58.540 --> 01:48:06.220]  Saudis for being heavily involved. And it's in the news that he was worried for his life.
[01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:10.160]  And you talk to local cops, I guess they're so cowardly, they're gonna go along with the
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:11.160]  official story.
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:16.580]  Well, the sheriff, they're not talking to the press, they're in complete Seal lips mode.
[01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:23.640]  I talked to several of Phil Marshall's friends and neighbors. Unfortunately, he was estranged
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:29.760]  from his wife, but it was very amicable. The thing that really is puzzling is he told people
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:34.020]  that he had this 9-millimeter Glock, but he said, a lot of good it'll do me, I don't have
[01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:35.020]  any bullets for it.
[01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:41.820]  It was registered, so they knew he had it. But the only thing the sheriff leaked out
[01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:47.660]  was that they found Phil Marshall's wedding ring on a box of that 9-millimeter ammo at
[01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:52.780]  the scene. And everybody who knew him told me, they said Phil hasn't worn a wedding ring
[01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:55.280]  since he was separated from his wife.
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:58.180]  So where did the ring come from?
[01:48:58.180 --> 01:49:02.780]  I saw this with that state senator, she called me, we need to look up her name, redhead,
[01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:06.700]  nice lady, she was fighting the CPS, taking kids. And she called, she said, I have the
[01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:11.320]  proof, I have the documents, the bounties on kids, I'm ready to come on next week.
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:15.420]  She called the producer, and that was a Thursday, she said, I'm ready to come on next week,
[01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:18.960]  they have a bounty on certain kids, I have the proof, we've got them, we're gonna save
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:19.960]  the kids.
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:24.980]  Her and her husband shot and killed themselves that Saturday at their house. I mean, I see
[01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:29.640]  this all the time, Wayne, and it's very, very dangerous. I mean, they kill you, they kill
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:32.020]  your family, and then they blame you for it.
[01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:38.380]  Right, and there was no suicide note in this case. And everyone who knew Phil Marshall
[01:49:38.380 --> 01:49:47.420]  said, he was an easygoing guy. But the interesting thing I picked up is that he told a very good
[01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:51.640]  friend of his that, he said, wait till you see my next book that's coming out, I really
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:53.540]  got some shocking stuff in it.
[01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:58.840]  He was working on yet another book. The question is, what happened to his computer? What happened
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:04.020]  to his files? I went to the front of his home and there right by the front door were a bunch
[01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:09.540]  of empty bankers boxes. I took a photo of it, I got it up on the website. But either
[01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:15.220]  they had one too many boxes to haul the files out or they had taken the files from these
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:18.100]  boxes and left the empty ones in front of the house.
[01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:22.500]  Why slaughter the kids now? Now that they like to kill the family now that they can,
[01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:26.140]  is it to demonize the subject or be able to shut the whole scene down?
[01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:32.700]  Yeah, it's to make the murder-suicide look plausible. That you've got a guy who's a ticking
[01:50:32.700 --> 01:50:39.300]  time bomb. Some of the local papers were terribly vicious against Marshall. The Union Democrat
[01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:41.980]  out of Sonora called him a killer.
[01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:47.940]  Yeah, it's a great way to demonize 9-11 truthers and quote conspiracy theorists. Absolutely.
[01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:52.140]  Well, another victory for the New World Order. I bet they really enjoyed killing those little
[01:50:52.140 --> 01:50:56.500]  kids. Just like the drones do every day, it's all part of the freedom. But the government
[01:50:56.500 --> 01:51:00.060]  loves us, I forgot. The two billion bullets are to take care of us. Stay there, Wayne
[01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:01.060]  Madsen.
[01:51:01.060 --> 01:51:08.180]  You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin
[01:51:08.180 --> 01:51:14.300]  with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits. After

[01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:05.040]  It's time for a home security quiz. Answer this. What effective home security device
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:09.360]  is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:14.260]  while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments
[01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:21.340]  and sells for less than $35? Yes, it's fake TV. This year about one in every 50 U.S. homes
[01:53:21.340 --> 01:53:26.100]  will have a break in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that
[01:53:26.100 --> 01:53:31.140]  looks like no one is home. Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look
[01:53:31.140 --> 01:53:36.540]  like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV. It's like a lamp
[01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:42.140]  on a timer but far more convincing. And for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference
[01:53:42.140 --> 01:53:47.700]  between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked. Go to Faketv.com or
[01:53:47.700 --> 01:54:05.700]  call 1-877-5FAKETV. That's 877-532-5388 or go to Faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:15.060]  Our investigator Wayne Madsen traveled to the home of Phillip Marshall, who was a clandestine
[01:54:15.060 --> 01:54:21.460]  black ops pilot with the CIA, that's undoubted. And he had written a book, The Big Bamboozled,
[01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:26.840]  United States Intelligence Community. And for that, his children have been murdered.
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:32.100]  And he has been framed. Some of the headlines at infoawards.com. Before we go back to Wayne,
[01:54:32.100 --> 01:54:37.100]  Sheriff warns of second American Revolution. If gun grabbers get their way, very powerful
[01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:42.940]  video, very powerful article, reporting on our interview yesterday. DHS supplier provides
[01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:44.820]  shooting targets of American gun owners.
[01:54:44.820 --> 01:54:51.220]  It is preparing for the gun confiscation war. Homeland Security, this is one of their vendors.
[01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:57.860]  Police claim Lanza in direct competition with Norwegian shooter Breivik. Democrats introduced
[01:54:57.860 --> 01:55:02.700]  this bill to allow police to search homes of gun owners without warrants. WWE creates
[01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:08.020]  racist wrestler to evenize Tea Party and Alex Jones. That's just some of the insane stuff
[01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:09.020]  happening.
[01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:11.580]  Wayne, I wanna talk to you more about this guy in this short segment, the little segment
[01:55:11.580 --> 01:55:19.380]  we have ahead of Max Keiser joining us, thewaynemadsenreport.com. Invaluable information. You've dealt with this,
[01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:24.660]  I've dealt with this. Many people we've known like Gary Webb, the DC Madam, they murder.
[01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:30.300]  I mean, it's really creepy. And it seems like there's an increase in murders going on this
[01:55:30.300 --> 01:55:36.060]  way. In a larger area, what do you think's happening? Then we'll get back into this case
[01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:40.780]  and you traveling there and getting the dirt on what happened.
[01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:46.340]  Well, I'm afraid what we're becoming, we're becoming like Argentina in the 1970s with
[01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:53.460]  people who were disappeared in plain sight. Hundreds and hundreds journalists, politicians,
[01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:57.780]  priests, you name it. And that's NDAA. I noticed since he did that, we're seeing more of it.
[01:55:57.780 --> 01:56:00.220]  I guess they tell him it's legal to kill us now.
[01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:06.780]  Right, so my fear is that that's what's happening here and we've got this complicit press, media.
[01:56:06.780 --> 01:56:12.140]  I mean, there's a couple of small papers out there. As I mentioned, one in Sonora, the
[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:14.340]  Union Democrat, really went after Marshall.
[01:56:14.340 --> 01:56:15.560]  They love it, yeah.
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:20.340]  The other paper, the Calaveras Enterprise, I thought was as fair as they could possibly
[01:56:20.340 --> 01:56:25.340]  be with limited resources. I mean, it's a 150-year-old paper that's struggling-
[01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:29.460]  Well, so you can't officially say government might have killed him cuz government only
[01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:35.020]  gives people little sweetie kisses at bed at night. But I mean, it's despicable. They
[01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:36.700]  could do this to you or I.
[01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:41.720]  Absolutely, and as you said, I got a couple of these threats myself and I always have
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:47.280]  to look out for myself. And I have to say that Marshall did tell some of his friends
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:55.740]  that he wasn't a paranoid person. But on occasion, he would mildly say, yeah, I always look behind
[01:56:55.740 --> 01:56:58.900]  me. I gotta always worry about my safety.
[01:56:58.900 --> 01:57:03.920]  And one of the things too is that some of the town, although Marshall's friends say
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:12.260]  there's no way this man killed his two kids who he did everything for and himself. But
[01:57:12.260 --> 01:57:16.460]  some people in the community obviously being tipped off by the police or putting the word
[01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:17.460]  out.
[01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:23.820]  And I'm reading from a posting on a local website out there. It says, if you're asked,
[01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:28.640]  and this is to members of the press, you tell them that Phil Marshall was diagnosed as a
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:32.680]  mentally ill person who got his hands on a gun.
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:36.180]  So the establishment's putting out talking points now.
[01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:42.960]  Absolutely, so the idea, Phil Marshall was not diagnosed in any sort. He did have a little
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:48.760]  issue with depression some years ago, but the only thing he had been treated for with
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:54.800]  any sort of medication recently was a bad knee. So, yeah, that-
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:58:01.160]  Look, here's the bottom line. Look at the mobile executive being killed and within minutes
[01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:05.120]  he's killed execution style and the police go, no, there's nothing suspicious, it's a
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:06.120]  mugging.
[01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:12.640]  Well, absolutely, and the fact is Marshall was a little different. After all he had written
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:19.600]  these two books about 9-11. He had written this book about the CIA and DEA and out of
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:25.040]  Lakefront Airport including. Well, one of his friends said that after Phil Marshall
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:29.840]  went to work for Eastern and he switched from Eastern, after Frank Lorenzo took over Eastern,
[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:35.920]  Phil Marshall was the kind of person who would not work in a company where the new owner
[01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:37.900]  was trying to kill off the union.
[01:58:37.900 --> 01:58:44.340]  So we'll be right back, stay there.

[02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:28.160]  Wayne Madsen's our guest. I want to invite him back up today on the nightly news for
[02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:33.120]  a commercial free 30 minute interview so we can really get into all this properly or tomorrow
[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:39.520]  whenever he can do it. Wayne, again, we've only got five minutes left. You've got the
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:42.800]  floor. What other tidbits do you think are important for people to know?
[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:48.120]  Well the biggest one of all, Sean Payton was the coach of the New Orleans Saints. When
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:58.440]  he was let go or suspended for rules violations, Phil Marshall was such a fan of the Saints
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:05.520]  and Sean Payton. He personally hired planes to fly over Saints games and multiple stadium
[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:12.160]  venues trailing a banner that said free Sean Payton. Now the fact is that he would have
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:18.200]  committed suicide and killed his two kids two days before the Super Bowl was held at
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:21.500]  the Saints home field at the Superdome in New Orleans.
[02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:29.760]  That alone made people say there's no way he did it. I'm not a big football fan, but
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:33.480]  people who were football fans- They're absolutely into it.
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:39.240]  There's no way he could have done this. Absolutely, but I mean look, he had a book out and I haven't
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:42.280]  read the book, but I read about it. I read the synopsis, Saudi intelligence tied into
[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:46.580]  the globalist car law group, spot on what happened. And he had another book coming out.
[02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:51.480]  They were scared of him. He knew secrets. And man, in the old days, they just kill you.
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:56.300]  Now they kill your kids. And it just shows how degenerate the system is. Wayne, if they
[02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:59.880]  keep killing people, you know this road goes two ways.
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:08.800]  Absolutely, and I'm afraid that what we're going to see here, as I said, is the termination
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:14.240]  with extreme prejudice that we saw our cronies in Latin America carrying out in the end of
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:15.700]  17- Yeah, but how long are people going to put
[02:02:15.700 --> 02:02:21.800]  up with that? Well, I mean, it's hard to say, but I got
[02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:27.360]  to say people out in that little county out there are scared and mad. So they're both.
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:29.860]  They're mad that this happened to their friend, Phil Marshall.
[02:02:29.860 --> 02:02:32.720]  How long did you spend there? So they know they whacked him. And it's the kids, it's
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:36.040]  whacking the kids. Yeah, I was there eight days. I was there
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:40.720]  a little over a week and- Wow, so what percentage of the neighbors
[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:44.620]  and people you talk to know that they got those kids and blew their heads off?
[02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:50.360]  Of those who knew Phil Marshall personally and worked with him, 100%. Of those who only
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:56.020]  knew him through the children going to the high school, there's a lot more who believe
[02:02:56.020 --> 02:03:01.840]  the official sheriff's department story. But that's, as I said, because the local media
[02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:08.120]  has really, except in one case, the one Calaveras paper, the local media has really been saying
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:13.680]  he was a cold blooded killer who snapped. Yeah, right.
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:18.240]  Yeah. You know, I'm getting demonized at, let's
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:24.340]  not exaggerate, 500% more than I've ever been demonized, Wayne. And I know you get demonized
[02:03:24.340 --> 02:03:27.760]  and things and all the people that serve the system need to know something.
[02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:31.640]  They're gonna take the pension funds everything very soon. We're gonna lose everything because
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:35.280]  all of you complied with this evil and were such cowards.
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:41.420]  Right. And I have to say that I was there on February 13th. That evening, someone broke
[02:03:41.420 --> 02:03:46.560]  into Phil Marshall's house through the backsliding door and was looking for something. Somebody
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:51.760]  is after something that he has. And I think whatever it is, it was so important, it was
[02:03:51.760 --> 02:04:00.800]  worth killing him and his two kids for. Unbelievable. Listen, are you back in DC?
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:06.560]  Yes, yes, I'm back. Well, you got good Skype, Wayne. I wanna get you back on the Nightly
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:10.800]  News tonight. Okay, sounds good.
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:14.160]  No, no, that's fine. He is scheduled for the Nightly News. You guys were one step ahead
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:19.040]  of me. Okay, who's doing the Nightly News tonight? All right, good, Sha'Carri Jackson
[02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:21.480]  too. I've got a special report I'm gonna do too.
[02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:25.320]  Wayne, we only got 30 seconds left. I mean, this is really making me angry at the New
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:30.480]  World Order, killing those kids. Yeah, the kids were really good kids. If they're
[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:35.760]  looking, if there was anything going on inside the family, I was told the older son, Alex
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:40.560]  17, by kids he knew in high school, they said, look, this kid wore his emotions on his sleeve.
[02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:45.500]  If there was anything going on inside the house, it would have been noticeable and nobody
[02:04:45.500 --> 02:04:52.600]  noticed any change in behavior. So there again, we have these kids just being eliminated with
[02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:56.840]  their father and the pet dog. And you get to demonize a father, a 9-11 truther and a
[02:04:56.840 --> 02:05:02.960]  gun owner all at the same time. Wayne Madsen, we'll talk to you tonight.

[02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:50.640]  Corey. This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover. The Greater Good, the most professional
[02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:55.880]  and up-to-date film I've ever seen exposing the scourge that is vaccines. These titles
[02:07:55.880 --> 02:08:02.880]  and a lot more are all available at infoawarshop.com.
[02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:32.880]  That's right. The turning away. You either fight the evil, and you're part of the solution,
[02:08:55.880 --> 02:09:00.880]  or you submit to the evil. And what happens with corruption is people give into it, they
[02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:05.680]  make excuses for it when it's small, and then it becomes bigger and bigger. And pretty soon,
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:10.320]  it's taking over everything, but still, you're making excuses for it. Look at the mainstream
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:16.300]  media and the way they're caught lying and deceiving and twisting. Look at what the police
[02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:22.280]  will go along with. Look at what parents will go along with and teachers. Look at our culture,
[02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:30.240]  bombarded with psychological warfare poison to turn us into a cross between a game show,
[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:33.000]  a gulag, and a casino.
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:39.900]  It's Max Keiser who coined the term the casino gulag. But I would add to it, it's like a
[02:09:39.900 --> 02:09:48.960]  game show casino gulag. And the dumbing down and the propaganda in every movie, every TV
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:55.240]  show, whether it's the new Die Hard movie or now WWE, every night when it's on to a
[02:09:55.240 --> 02:10:03.320]  record audience of 14, 15 million, Alex Jones is racist. And the Jack Swagger is a racist
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:06.600]  and he loves Alex Jones.
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:14.000]  That's running man level bizarreness. And the government murdering 9-11 truthers and
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:19.420]  buying 2 billion bullets and launching drones and checkpoints. And now they're announcing
[02:10:19.420 --> 02:10:26.080]  what we knew, massive tax increases, getting rid of pre-existing coverage, bankrupting
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:33.020]  people, doubling the insurance premiums, giant payroll tax increases on poor, just like they've
[02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:37.120]  done in Europe with austerity.
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:41.960]  Criminals at every level of government and corporations encouraging each other to just
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:48.880]  in mass attack us at every level to gain as much ground as they can get to break our will.
[02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:53.360]  And you see the turning away. You see people building the wall, to use another Pink Floyd
[02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:57.720]  analogy or allegory. And then the worms, the worms, they enter your brain and you just
[02:10:57.720 --> 02:10:58.720]  stop caring.
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:04.840]  You just give in, you just say, so many people get abused and they become abusers, I've noticed.
[02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:12.240]  Whether it's financial or spiritual or cultural abuse, I always, if I got abused, I learned
[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:16.080]  how to fight back against it. If somebody did something wrong to me, I sure didn't go
[02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:17.080]  to other people.
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:21.340]  Like I've been robbed, I've been cheated, so I'll start cheating people. But that's
[02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:27.280]  the prevailing false wisdom and it makes me sick. And there's no doubt, Max Keiser's prediction
[02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:32.580]  has come true. He said that about three years ago, he said you would see the collapse accelerate
[02:11:32.580 --> 02:11:37.520]  within three years. He's a former top stockbroker, inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange Virtual
[02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:38.520]  Trading System.
[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:43.880]  It's the basis of what's used on most stock exchanges today. And he said about six months
[02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:49.400]  ago, he said by April of next year, the collapse will be completely evident that it's accelerating.
[02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:53.840]  And they're not gonna tell you there's a collapse, but there's currency crises. They're already
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:12:00.340]  writing public and private pension funds. The consumer confidence is imploding. They're
[02:12:00.340 --> 02:12:02.760]  going after people's 401Ks.
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:09.200]  Obamacare has a 401K, 3.8% tax in it. And my dad's in healthcare management. He said,
[02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:15.460]  this is designed to hurt poor people. He said, it's unbelievable how it's meant to get rid
[02:12:15.460 --> 02:12:19.360]  of Medicare and Medicaid and then make you get insurance. And it doubles the first year
[02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:23.920]  and then $5,000 a year, I mean, that's just devastating.
[02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:28.520]  And it's so brutal to understand this tyranny. It's not just a tyranny that has tyranny to
[02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:32.800]  be in power. You've had a lot of tyrannies like that and they're bad. This is a scientific
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:37.880]  tyranny where they've decided to go all the way and just be so evil no one can overthrow
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:38.880]  them.
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:42.040]  And they call that the final revolution, Bertrand Russell and others. George Arwell, who was
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:45.520]  part of the Fabian socialist and led into their group, real name Eric Blair. He wrote
[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:50.020]  about O'Brien, again, it's an allegory, torturing O'Brien, that's the symbol of the British
[02:12:50.020 --> 02:12:57.240]  press, into submission. And saying, it doesn't matter, it's trampling and being trampled
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:12:59.360]  on, a boot stomping on the human face.
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:05.320]  You think gravity matters? We could create a parallel system to suspend gravity and have
[02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:11.840]  people believe it. We are the priests of power. We want to tear everything apart because that's
[02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:21.000]  what we like. The journey is the destination. And this is false mental illness being projected
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:27.360]  onto us by unhappy, inbred, mentally ill aristocracy and the bureaucracies they've created that
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:31.640]  are fully weaponized and fully turned over to darkness.
[02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:34.600]  Now I've got some of the financial news here. I'm gonna mention some headlines and go to
[02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:40.840]  Max Keiser at maxkeiser.com, TV and syndicated radio host. G20 Summit to Focus on Currency
[02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:47.360]  War, Threat to Economy. These are the people, this is like the foxes having a meeting about
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:49.040]  the hens that got killed last night.
[02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:53.120]  So they can then act like the saviors and give you more solutions, more power for them.
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:57.920]  Funds run low for health insurance and state high risk pools. The banks that own the insurance
[02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:02.440]  companies wrote it. And again, it's so incredible that people are being raped by Obama who's
[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:08.160]  a puppet and they're thanking him for it because he's fighting the Tea Party racist.
[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:12.280]  Frustrated Madoff now second guessing his guilty plea, pointing out that everything
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:16.680]  he does is what the mainstream banks do. Yeah, but you're a low level guy, buddy. They needed
[02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:23.720]  somebody to go to jail. Central banks buy the most gold since 1964, as Keiser predicted.
[02:14:23.720 --> 02:14:32.680]  Higher taxes puts the brakes on retail shopping, CNBC. See, of course, and again, I saw John
[02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:37.360]  Paul DeGioria, who's a self-made billionaire, going Obama, when you raise taxes on, it's
[02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:38.360]  gonna hurt the economy.
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:43.800]  Why don't you wake up? Don't you care? Of course, he knows. This is scorched earth,
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:49.080]  bankrupt us, bring us into submission, overrun us with illegals who'll work for nothing.
[02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:52.320]  Not even bashing the illegals, they're part of the cold blooded tool. They've already
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:56.440]  forced them off their land all over Mexico, made them go to Mexico City to live in hell,
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:14:58.540]  to force them up here.
[02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:05.560]  And then play us off against each other. And it just goes on and on. I bring you Max Keiser.
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:09.520]  Max, we could be like Argentina, which is where we're going, or Greece. They'll still
[02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:15.120]  tell us we left the recession four years ago. I want you to break down the latest news,
[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:22.400]  where we are on the DEATHCON clock here. Have we gone to the highest DEATHCON yet? Max Keiser.
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:30.400]  Hey, Alex, great to be on with you, with your global audience of millions. Well, as you
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:38.480]  know, seven months ago or so, I made a very aggressive prediction of a huge collapse by
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:39.800]  April of this year.
[02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:46.480]  So we've got two months left on that prediction. It's a very aggressive prediction. What we
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:52.380]  have in the mix right now, we do have the currency wars. That has become a headline
[02:15:52.380 --> 02:15:58.400]  that is splashed all over newspapers around the world. The various countries are trying
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:01.000]  to debase their own currency.
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:05.560]  They are in effect, it's a firing squad lined up in a circle.
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:09.200]  It's a race to the bottom, exactly as Ross Perot warned us.
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:15.480]  Yeah, and now at the G20 meeting, they all explained how this was a good thing because
[02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:20.320]  they're just helping each other's export business. And it's not about a trade war and it won't
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:27.440]  devolve into a hot war. But of course, that's false. The truth of the reality here is that
[02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:33.120]  they're still allowing the Japanese yen to collapse more than any other currency because
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:41.440]  it provides the cheapest source of funds for these governments to engage in buying each
[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:43.400]  other's sovereign debt.
[02:16:43.400 --> 02:16:48.720]  Because since the collapse of 2007, 2008, since the Lehman Brothers collapsed, there
[02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:54.240]  is one market that has been kept artificially afloat these past five years. And that is
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:59.600]  the bond market and the sovereign bond market. And it's been kept afloat by things like quantitative
[02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:01.600]  easing and by governments buying each other's bonds.
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:05.160]  And that's the bubble you predicted will blow up by late April.
[02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:12.560]  Right, this is the bubble that is yet to blow up and it'll be the most spectacular bubble.
[02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:18.080]  Another development since we spoke last is that you've got two currencies that have been
[02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:24.720]  identified as possibly the next two currencies to go down an Argentinian-like rabbit hole
[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:29.960]  of destruction. One is the Japanese yen for the reasons we just discussed. And now people
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:32.280]  are talking about the British pound.
[02:17:32.280 --> 02:17:39.320]  All right, Matt, your Skype is breaking up a bit. Start back over, you said the British
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:40.320]  pound.
[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:41.320]  All right, how's this, better?
[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:42.320]  Yes, sir.
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:43.320]  British pound, is this better?
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:44.320]  Yes, sir.
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:49.680]  All right, so the British pound was seen as a safe haven. But now with the euro doing
[02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:55.060]  better, people are pulling out of the British pound. And you've got people like George Soros
[02:17:55.060 --> 02:18:00.160]  and other hedge fund managers publicly saying they are now in full attack mode against the
[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:05.720]  British pound. And this means that the British pound's credit rating will be downgraded.
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:09.740]  And what's gonna happen here in Britain and why we moved to Britain, because we knew this
[02:18:09.740 --> 02:18:17.440]  was going to come, is they're gonna have to have a full-scale currency debasement or downgrading
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:24.300]  a revaluation by 30 or 40%, which means that inflation will skyrocket here.
[02:18:24.300 --> 02:18:29.760]  And it's already a huge problem, Alex, and here the big story the past week has been
[02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:36.840]  about horse meat. They have discovered horse meat in all of the beef, meat products.
[02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:41.500]  That's how they're trying to keep inflation down is debasing everything, turning the cigarettes
[02:18:41.500 --> 02:18:46.560]  into sawdust and fake chocolate and synthetic gin, aka 1984.
[02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:53.360]  Exactly, you also have a story about Maker's Mark whiskey, I guess it is in the US, has
[02:18:53.360 --> 02:18:58.100]  been caught watering down their whiskey. But this is an inflation story, where you see
[02:18:58.100 --> 02:19:02.960]  substitution for cheaper meats and then this gets horse meat for beef. And because the
[02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:07.840]  agricultural industry can't keep prices down anymore, they've gone through the genetically
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:14.140]  modified organism series of price deductions, they've gone through globalization and the
[02:19:14.140 --> 02:19:18.200]  price deductions. But starting two or three years ago and starting post-crisis and starting
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:23.280]  with that speculation that we've seen in agricultural commodities that led to the Arab Spring and
[02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:30.040]  the revolution in Egypt, food prices and fuel prices, gas prices are now inescapably starting
[02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:33.900]  to edge higher in ways that are out of control.
[02:19:33.900 --> 02:19:37.680]  And it doesn't matter how much quantitative easing or any of these other programs are
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:43.720]  in place, the wheels are coming off. I hear the music introducing the commercial, so I
[02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:47.720]  guess we're segueing into a break, am I correct?
[02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:50.640]  You're absolutely right, and you said it would happen in England, you said it would happen
[02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:56.560]  with the currency market and with the bonds. And we're going to look at what's coming next
[02:19:56.560 --> 02:20:05.320]  with Max Keiser straight ahead. I'm Alex Jones.
[02:20:05.320 --> 02:20:11.240]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year. Burglars call it smash
[02:20:11.240 --> 02:20:18.800]  and grab. Police call it robbery. We call it avoidable. We are fake TV, a simple electronic
[02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:25.200]  device that can fool even professional burglars. Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates
[02:20:25.200 --> 02:20:29.920]  the changing colors of a television. To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home
[02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:34.500]  watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target.
[02:20:34.500 --> 02:20:39.760]  At only $34.95, fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plants, and
[02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:47.040]  it's perfect if you're traveling or away from home. Order your fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV
[02:20:47.040 --> 02:21:01.040]  or go to faketv.com. That's 877-532-5388 or faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:34.040]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[02:22:34.040 --> 02:22:39.160]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't
[02:22:39.160 --> 02:22:43.740]  recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet
[02:22:43.740 --> 02:22:50.320]  no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:56.160]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237. Secure
[02:22:56.160 --> 02:23:05.840]  your future and call 1-800-686-2237. You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa
[02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:11.560]  where a nicely furnished cabin with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine, and laundry
[02:23:11.560 --> 02:23:18.080]  service awaits. After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins. You're on a golden
[02:23:18.080 --> 02:23:25.640]  stag safari for big game. But it's not Africa, it's Argentina. One on one guided hunts for
[02:23:25.640 --> 02:23:32.760]  water buffalo, huger, bighorn rams, wild boar, and the biggest stag deer in South America.

[02:23:39.900 --> 02:23:45.880]  scopes, all food, beverages, hunting guides, ground transportation included, and more,

[02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:58.000]  the big game hunting ranch, GoldenStagSafaris.com.
[02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:18.760]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio. George Strait was singing...
[02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:22.760]  All right, Max Keiser is our guest for the balance of the hour, and I've got a bunch
[02:24:22.760 --> 02:24:27.000]  of news items I want to go over with him. You've been over in Europe, you were over
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:31.260]  in France, you've been over in Greece, doing live reporting. You're in England right now,
[02:24:31.260 --> 02:24:35.960]  there with your radio show and TV show. All the details of that are at maxkeiser.com.
[02:24:35.960 --> 02:24:40.180]  But Max, I mean, clearly governments are arming to the teeth everywhere. It's not just the
[02:24:40.180 --> 02:24:44.900]  US government now buying 2 billion rounds of hollow point illegal for warfare under
[02:24:44.900 --> 02:24:50.960]  Geneva Convention bullets, armored vehicles, drones launching. I mean, it's not just, hey,
[02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:55.320]  we're gonna become authoritarian. It's like this is a party or something.
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:25:01.320]  And it's the same thing in Europe. Just absolutely, the head of the IMF saying, six days a week
[02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:07.320]  isn't enough work, more money Greeks, when she's exempt from the taxes under EU bureaucracy.
[02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:12.100]  All the mega banks are exempt from taxes. I mean, but the general public is still so
[02:25:12.100 --> 02:25:19.240]  mesmerized by the Gulag casino model, that the 20 or 30% of us that are awake, we're
[02:25:19.240 --> 02:25:23.380]  being demonized. I mean, this is like the world going crazy.
[02:25:23.380 --> 02:25:29.760]  This is more than just a corrupt establishment. Is it not the supine, servile, sycophantic
[02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:36.640]  public begging to be absolutely financially and physically overrun and gang raped? Isn't
[02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:40.160]  that only inviting the predators?
[02:25:40.160 --> 02:25:47.600]  You now have a generation that is calm and doesn't understand what financial independence
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:54.960]  is anymore. So you have an entire generation in America that has been dependent on the
[02:25:54.960 --> 02:26:00.040]  government. So they've lost the memory of what being financially independent is all
[02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:04.600]  about. And that's key. And that's what the people who want to continue to destroy the
[02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:09.040]  system are banking on. They want to destroy the memory. They want to get rid of this.
[02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:15.360]  My generation was the last generation, I think, that really had an appreciation for economic
[02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:21.920]  and financial freedom. But now the current crop has lost touch completely. They don't
[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:27.840]  understand that they have it within their own means, according to the Constitution in
[02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:34.400]  the United States, anyway, to be independent of the corporacy and the government. So they've
[02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:39.560]  lost touch completely. So they've lost, how are they going to mount any kind of resistance?
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:42.800]  They have no idea even what you're talking about anymore. It's become abstract because
[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:49.040]  this has been going on quite seriously for 20 years, quite with a heart attack. Now,
[02:26:49.040 --> 02:26:58.320]  in Europe, of course, it's a different situation because it's a very government controlled
[02:26:58.320 --> 02:27:05.120]  situation. In France, the government controls something like 65% of the economy. Here in
[02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:11.520]  the UK, the government now is controlled just under 50% of the economy, 49.5%. It's creeping
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:13.080]  up higher and higher.
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:17.880]  And there's never enough because select corporations want that because the government then gives
[02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:23.240]  them control. I just had an epiphany. Of course, this is in Wall-E and The Matrix and everywhere.
[02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:32.800]  But we are devolving into proto-Matrix-like little blobs that watch TV all day and are
[02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:39.640]  very, very physically weak and pathetic and mindless and IQs are dropping. And so for
[02:27:39.640 --> 02:27:44.720]  large parts of people, it's scary to have a job or invent things or work. The government's
[02:27:44.720 --> 02:27:49.200]  their mommy. They really believe it loves them. They're like Arrested Development half-wit
[02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:56.520]  children who are proto-Matrix wireheads who will be inserted into the virtual reality.
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:28:01.360]  They're ready to plug themselves in. They're ready to have the government wipe their butts.
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:07.200]  Well, social networking is turning out to being a way to harness the population in a
[02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:13.900]  Matrix-like fashion. So the social media networks are providing data. And you see this now being
[02:28:13.900 --> 02:28:20.020]  captured by large corporations like IBM, International Business Machines, who are using what they
[02:28:20.020 --> 02:28:27.760]  call big data to harness social networks to sell into these networks products that they
[02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:31.560]  have figured out by using what they call predictive analysis.
[02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:39.160]  So for example, two years ago, there was a culture trend called steampunk, which was
[02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:45.880]  gathering force on the periphery of the culture. And IBM figured this out. And now they're
[02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:51.960]  going to relaunch steampunk as a mainstream cultural phenomenon. But by then, they will
[02:28:51.960 --> 02:28:57.480]  have kind of reinterpreted it and owned it and own the copyrights to it. And they will
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:28:59.680]  capitalize on it and monetize it.
[02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:03.960]  Sure, the NSA isn't really spying on terrorists. The globalists run those. They know what they're
[02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:08.800]  doing. It's spying on what the new trend is, like strawberries. And I'm throwing out a
[02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:14.000]  fake trend there. But just as an example, and now on YouTube and stuff, they're putting
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:20.120]  you in your niche not to give you what you want. They're trying to put people in boxes
[02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:21.960]  to then program those boxes.
[02:29:21.960 --> 02:29:30.280]  They talk about predictive crime technology, which gets the headlines. But there's another
[02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:34.800]  side to this, which is predictive marketing, using social networks to figure out where
[02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:40.240]  you'll be when and what your mood will be and how susceptible you are to what type of
[02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:46.240]  advertising message and how access you have to that's right. That's right. Google admits
[02:29:46.240 --> 02:29:49.720]  they can now predict the future in mass movements and know where you're going to stop to eat
[02:29:49.720 --> 02:29:50.720]  before you do.
[02:29:50.720 --> 02:30:01.680]  In March, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:41.200 --> 02:30:46.280]  chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the

[02:33:03.040 --> 02:33:09.720]  Raging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[02:33:09.720 --> 02:33:10.720]  the InfoWar.
[02:33:10.720 --> 02:33:19.400]  All right, I want to get more into the economy with Max Keiser and open the phones up if
[02:33:19.400 --> 02:33:23.680]  you have financial questions for him. I want to talk about why are central banks buying
[02:33:23.680 --> 02:33:28.840]  so much gold while using the media to demonize it. That's all coming up. If you want to get
[02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:37.320]  a question into Max Keiser, I'd love to hear from you. 800-259-9231. 800-259-9231. First
[02:33:37.320 --> 02:33:40.080]  time callers, financial questions or other questions for Max Keiser.
[02:33:40.080 --> 02:33:46.520]  Before we go back to Max, I want to get his take on this. About four or five months ago,
[02:33:46.520 --> 02:33:52.960]  somebody had hung up homemade signs. They don't even say where, no photo, no proof,
[02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:59.320]  no nothing. Somewhere in LA talking about victory against tyranny. And so they sent
[02:33:59.320 --> 02:34:02.680]  me three different notices over $1,000 total.
[02:34:02.680 --> 02:34:08.720]  No judge, no jury, saying you'll be arrested or have a civil lawsuit or bad credit if you
[02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:12.800]  don't pay us. Now that's illegal when you don't have the authority or the statutory
[02:34:12.800 --> 02:34:18.440]  power to just say you will pay us or we will arrest you. No arresting officer, no citation,
[02:34:18.440 --> 02:34:24.320]  no nothing. We send them letters going, there is Obama. And we're gonna show this article
[02:34:24.320 --> 02:34:30.120]  at Infowars.com cuz I wanna actually show people at Infowars.com.
[02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:37.960]  That's why I had Paul Watson today actually add some examples into the article. You guys
[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:43.600]  can actually just punch up my screen if you'd like. And if you look here, it's people painted
[02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:49.840]  hope on a wall. That's somebody's door that a tagger put President Obama on it. Now is
[02:34:49.840 --> 02:34:56.280]  President Obama going to get bills for people that tag his bumper stickers or signs or his
[02:34:56.280 --> 02:35:00.760]  face on walls or doorways or fences?
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:06.160]  And the answer is no. I'll never forget about five, six years ago, a city of New Zealand
[02:35:06.160 --> 02:35:10.020]  sent me a letter and said that I would be billed the next time someone spray painted
[02:35:10.020 --> 02:35:16.700]  Infowars.com on a building. And they actually showed an old six, seven story building that
[02:35:16.700 --> 02:35:21.080]  someone had sprayed Infowars on that was set to be demolished, they even admitted.
[02:35:21.080 --> 02:35:25.160]  And it made the news that someone got up on the old building and sprayed Infowars.com.
[02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:29.720]  I mean, that's just, they're afraid of you communicating. They're afraid of you getting
[02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:33.720]  outside the matrix. They're afraid of real means they can't control, so it's the ultimate
[02:35:33.720 --> 02:35:39.960]  evil. But again, we even we sell bumper stickers, there's a pledge on there that by buying these
[02:35:39.960 --> 02:35:43.520]  you pledge to only post these in legal and lawful areas like your own property or give
[02:35:43.520 --> 02:35:44.520]  them to friends and family.
[02:35:44.520 --> 02:35:48.560]  But it's not my issue, but this wasn't even something we sold one of our stickers. They
[02:35:48.560 --> 02:35:52.820]  don't even give a proof of what it is. It's something about victory, you are not alone.
[02:35:52.820 --> 02:36:00.220]  We had a poster contest for victory symbols and to post it on your own property. So they
[02:36:00.220 --> 02:36:04.960]  tell us you're going, you can go read the letters. You're going to be arrested or we're
[02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:10.160]  going to sue you. And listen, they don't care. If they sue me and I sue them and win, which
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:14.160]  I've talked to my lawyer, we could win, I mean, they're breaking a bunch of laws.
[02:36:14.160 --> 02:36:18.040]  They don't care, they'll just use taxpayer money. And they wanna bankrupt California.
[02:36:18.040 --> 02:36:23.200]  They wanna, see, they've got it set up where they can do whatever they want until they're
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:28.360]  arrested. And Antonio Villaraigosa is a La Raza Hispanic clan member. I mean, just a
[02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:31.780]  horrible person, and he doesn't care.
[02:36:31.780 --> 02:36:38.220]  And so imagine Obama, I mean, imagine somebody put city of LA stickers up,.gov, would they
[02:36:38.220 --> 02:36:43.160]  send themselves bills? And they won't respond to our letters. There's no judge, there's
[02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:46.580]  no jury, there's no arrest, there's no nothing, there's no proof, there's no nothing. It's
[02:36:46.580 --> 02:36:49.180]  just you will pay us money or.
[02:36:49.180 --> 02:36:53.900]  Now if I sent letters out saying, you will pay me $1,000 or I will sue you and gave no
[02:36:53.900 --> 02:36:59.040]  proof or reason, that's called extortion. And when government does it, it's even more
[02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:03.740]  illegal. And I break it all down in the article. I'm gonna go to Max Keiser on this, but it
[02:37:03.740 --> 02:37:05.440]  says, this is my comment.
[02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:09.520]  This is a conscious fraud the city of Los Angeles knows full well that we are not liable
[02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:14.440]  for someone else's activities. There's no due process, no evidence, no citation, nothing.
[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:19.420]  The city of Los Angeles is engaging in unconstitutional extortion using terroristic threats of civil
[02:37:19.420 --> 02:37:22.020]  and criminal penalties and threatening our credit.
[02:37:22.020 --> 02:37:27.520]  If we don't pay them more than $1,000 by simply searching the term Obama Street Art LA, you
[02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:31.220]  can find hundreds of mural signs and other street art depicting Obama in a favorable
[02:37:31.220 --> 02:37:36.340]  light. Under Los Angeles delusional legal control freak theories, I would add, Barack
[02:37:36.340 --> 02:37:41.100]  Obama must immediately pay hundreds of dollars for each infraction.
[02:37:41.100 --> 02:37:46.380]  Now, here's the deal. They'll probably claim this was illegal too cuz they're God and it's
[02:37:46.380 --> 02:37:50.180]  our job to roll over and they burned down a house and say they didn't and that we're
[02:37:50.180 --> 02:37:56.740]  gonna burn it down. Burn it, yeah, somebody say, burn that house down, burn him out. You
[02:37:56.740 --> 02:38:01.180]  didn't hear that, you liver livid little long haired galoot.
[02:38:01.180 --> 02:38:09.860]  Shut up and pay me the money. I'll sue you. I'll arrest you. I'll give you bad credit.
[02:38:09.860 --> 02:38:15.100]  I mean, how much of this are we gonna put up with? I mean, it's just a bunch of burn
[02:38:15.100 --> 02:38:23.940]  down that cabin. Hey, I saw you burn that down, Yosemite. You didn't see no such thing.
[02:38:23.940 --> 02:38:28.820]  All right, I'm sorry, Max Geiser's holding, waiting. Here's their phone number for Antonio
[02:38:28.820 --> 02:38:35.200]  Villaraigosa, the king, the Hispanic clan member of the south. Here is the phone number
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:37.260]  for this guy.
[02:38:37.260 --> 02:38:43.020]  And you should call him up at their godlike number and say so, I saw Obama signs on the
[02:38:43.020 --> 02:38:47.680]  wall. You're gonna send him a bill and direct them to infoawards.com. Get their attention,
[02:38:47.680 --> 02:38:55.940]  they're not God. 213-473-3231. Yes, go ahead, show a document, Kim, of that. There you go,
[02:38:55.940 --> 02:38:56.940]  there's the number.
[02:38:56.940 --> 02:39:02.860]  Request for service, just 800-996-CITY. Maybe you want a SWAT team to drop by and burn your
[02:39:02.860 --> 02:39:07.500]  house down, you can call that number, like one of their other great people, Dorner. So
[02:39:07.500 --> 02:39:17.540]  800-996-CITY or TDD, what does that mean? 213-473-3231. And you can call any of these
[02:39:17.540 --> 02:39:22.900]  people, the president, the vice president, the president proteum, the commissioner, the
[02:39:22.900 --> 02:39:23.900]  commissioner.
[02:39:23.900 --> 02:39:30.660]  City of Los Angeles, the mayor, the mayor. I don't need courts, I don't need proof, I
[02:39:30.660 --> 02:39:39.660]  don't need facts. I am the mighty Antonio Villaraigosa. Out of that corner, the population,
[02:39:39.660 --> 02:39:44.420]  we don't need no stinging courts for them. Just send them bills and threaten them. I
[02:39:44.420 --> 02:39:49.700]  am King. All right, I'm gonna go to Max Keiser. Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help. It's
[02:39:49.700 --> 02:39:58.580]  invoice number, 201-2000-4913. Tell them you need help on that invoice number.
[02:39:58.580 --> 02:40:03.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, they'll probably try to sue me over that. Fine, you wanna fight,
[02:40:03.380 --> 02:40:08.460]  you got one. But most people get these threats and pay up. What if somebody went out and
[02:40:08.460 --> 02:40:12.980]  put McDonald's stuff everywhere, they'd know it was a false flag. You could false flag
[02:40:12.980 --> 02:40:17.340]  somebody with this. How we know Antonio Villaraigosa isn't the one doing it. Max Keiser, thank
[02:40:17.340 --> 02:40:19.700]  you for joining us from maxkeiser.com.
[02:40:19.700 --> 02:40:23.740]  What is your take on the arbitrariness of drones will just kill you if you want. We'll
[02:40:23.740 --> 02:40:27.340]  secretly arrest you and torture you if you want. We'll have NATO over the military cuz
[02:40:27.340 --> 02:40:32.420]  we want. Government just doing whatever it wants. What do you call that, Max Keiser?
[02:40:32.420 --> 02:40:39.980]  Harassment, they are being harassed by the federal government. So you're on the harassing
[02:40:39.980 --> 02:40:44.020]  of the week or the month. They're just gonna harass you, man.
[02:40:44.020 --> 02:40:51.820]  Los Angeles, of course, is a one industry town. And that industry is the film industry.
[02:40:51.820 --> 02:40:58.380]  So pick a film that's gonna open in a few months and start a grassroots campaign right
[02:40:58.380 --> 02:41:04.780]  now why people should not go to that film as a way to hit LA where it hurts in the film
[02:41:04.780 --> 02:41:10.900]  industry. If you're upset that Aaron Schwartz was killed, as his dad said, by Chris Dodd
[02:41:10.900 --> 02:41:13.460]  of the MPAA murdered his kid.
[02:41:13.460 --> 02:41:18.500]  If you're upset that the Hollywood industry has monopolized copyright and destroyed the
[02:41:18.500 --> 02:41:22.540]  creative industries in America, pick a film that's gonna open in a few months and get
[02:41:22.540 --> 02:41:27.500]  a grassroots campaign going right now so that that film does doodly squat in business as
[02:41:27.500 --> 02:41:31.500]  a way to fight back this harassment from LA to Austin.
[02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:39.180]  That's right, LA is long tentacle, slimy tentacle of the corrupt Los Angeles reaching into Texas
[02:41:39.180 --> 02:41:40.780]  trying to get my money.
[02:41:40.780 --> 02:41:45.500]  Yeah, so fight back. There's gotta be a film that's opening up in a few months and just
[02:41:45.500 --> 02:41:52.180]  start reverse propaganda. They're harassing you, harass them. Just start talking about
[02:41:52.180 --> 02:41:57.100]  why the film stinks, why nobody should go see it, why it's a scourge on society, and
[02:41:57.100 --> 02:41:58.100]  see if you can't take-
[02:41:58.100 --> 02:42:03.460]  Well, I did help out Machete and the Charlie Sheen TV show. I guess I do give my gifts
[02:42:03.460 --> 02:42:04.460]  to Hollywood.
[02:42:04.460 --> 02:42:09.540]  Well, now you gotta work in reverse, like kill it. You gotta kill one of these film
[02:42:09.540 --> 02:42:12.660]  projects that's coming out in a few months.
[02:42:12.660 --> 02:42:17.860]  Yeah, let's take down World War Z because it's an anti-human film about mowing down
[02:42:17.860 --> 02:42:23.260]  humanity and how great we'll be when human life is reduced and how great Marxism is.
[02:42:23.260 --> 02:42:25.940]  We've actually done a review of that. Let's take down World War Z.
[02:42:25.940 --> 02:42:30.540]  Well, you did a great review on the Batman film where you predicted the event. What about
[02:42:30.540 --> 02:42:36.020]  this Hunger Games film? This Hunger Games film's coming out. It's the most cynical film
[02:42:36.020 --> 02:42:40.740]  I've seen in 20 years where they're just setting up kids to be gunned down for the amusement
[02:42:40.740 --> 02:42:45.180]  of the cartel lobby in Hollywood. The people who are killing the kids in Hunger Games are
[02:42:45.180 --> 02:42:46.180]  the executives in Hollywood.
[02:42:46.180 --> 02:42:49.380]  Oh, that then puts the idea out that it's fun to go kill kids. They're actually-
[02:42:49.380 --> 02:42:50.380]  That's right.
[02:42:50.380 --> 02:42:54.460]  That's hyper subliminal, open subliminal programming.
[02:42:54.460 --> 02:42:58.100]  That's right. Let's take it down. Let's make sure that film does no business. That's a
[02:42:58.100 --> 02:43:02.100]  complete failure. Put those producers out of business.
[02:43:02.100 --> 02:43:08.060]  Well, Hunger Games is the casino gulag system they wanna create, Max.
[02:43:08.060 --> 02:43:13.380]  That's exactly right. So there's no reason why the people who support the cartel of copyrights,
[02:43:13.380 --> 02:43:20.380]  who murdered Aaron Swartz by basically threatening him to put him in the gulag for 30 years for
[02:43:20.380 --> 02:43:25.100]  refreshing his constitutionally guaranteed right to share copyrighted material under
[02:43:25.100 --> 02:43:26.100]  fair use.
[02:43:26.100 --> 02:43:31.660]  They killed him, as his dad said. There are two major industries in America that are tied
[02:43:31.660 --> 02:43:32.660]  in with-
[02:43:32.660 --> 02:43:36.060]  All right, I agree. I wanna shift gears with you, because I wanna go to-
[02:43:36.060 --> 02:43:40.140]  And one is the copyright industry. These two industries are the frickin' frack of what's
[02:43:40.140 --> 02:43:44.260]  destroying the economy in the US. We talk about bankers all the time. Let's talk about
[02:43:44.260 --> 02:43:50.380]  them in Jetson. I agree, and listen, we can go into overdrive if you want, cuz it's always
[02:43:50.380 --> 02:43:51.780]  interesting to have you here, but I wanna go to some calls.
[02:43:51.780 --> 02:43:56.660]  But let me just ask you briefly. What do you make of the new homeland security targets
[02:43:56.660 --> 02:44:01.780]  of pregnant women with little kids to be shot? They call it no more hesitation. That's up
[02:44:01.780 --> 02:44:06.180]  at infowars.com, and the military training to quote, take out zombie hordes. And the
[02:44:06.180 --> 02:44:07.620]  media goes, it's a joke.
[02:44:07.620 --> 02:44:12.780]  No, it's the cover to practice mowing down human waves of Americans. The government is
[02:44:12.780 --> 02:44:17.860]  training to kill us en masse. Do you think the bankers are gonna really be successful
[02:44:17.860 --> 02:44:18.860]  with that?
[02:44:18.860 --> 02:44:24.180]  Well, you know, they'll never wanna kill the fetuses. But I have a good idea, actually.
[02:44:24.180 --> 02:44:32.700]  This is a good doofer for people who are anti-abortion and pro-guns. Give fetuses guns. This way,
[02:44:32.700 --> 02:44:35.740]  if someone tries to abort them, they can shoot their way out of the womb.
[02:44:35.740 --> 02:44:42.340]  All right, Max, that's actually a very interesting idea that you have there, doctor. Let's expand
[02:44:42.340 --> 02:44:49.140]  on that seriously. The insane arms race of now 2 billion bullets they've bought, the
[02:44:49.140 --> 02:44:54.140]  checkpoints on the highways now in Austin where I live. How much crazier will it get?
[02:44:54.140 --> 02:44:58.500]  All this parading around, I don't see it actually intimidating the awake public.
[02:44:58.500 --> 02:44:59.500]  I see it-
[02:44:59.500 --> 02:45:02.900]  I said on your show two years ago when you were talking about inflation hedges. We talked
[02:45:02.900 --> 02:45:07.400]  about gold, and we talked about whiskey, and we talked about bullets. Now, they're hoarding
[02:45:07.400 --> 02:45:08.400]  all the bullets.
[02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:11.980]  That's what you said. You said buy bullets, buy guns, you won't be able to get them.
[02:45:11.980 --> 02:45:16.580]  Forget the guns, just the bullets. The bullets are a commodity. A gun without a bullet doesn't
[02:45:16.580 --> 02:45:17.580]  do much good.
[02:45:17.580 --> 02:45:19.340]  It's like a tractor without gas.
[02:45:19.340 --> 02:45:24.740]  Right, so the bullets are always the weak spot in this whole theory, and they are hoarding
[02:45:24.740 --> 02:45:29.220]  all of the bullets. The bullets will not be unavailable at Kmart or Walmart or anyone
[02:45:29.220 --> 02:45:33.300]  else. They're hoarding all the bullets, but you can buy them as an individual bullet for
[02:45:33.300 --> 02:45:38.100]  $50 or $100 per bullet on the black market. And of course, they'll be servicing the black
[02:45:38.100 --> 02:45:43.260]  market. They plan to do the bullets what the Egyptian gulag casino operators did to the
[02:45:43.260 --> 02:45:44.980]  price of wheat.
[02:45:44.980 --> 02:45:50.100]  Man, it really is like a society run by the devil. I mean, I don't know how else to describe
[02:45:50.100 --> 02:45:51.100]  this.
[02:45:51.100 --> 02:45:55.300]  Just look at the economics of it, and that was always the weak spot in the US system.
[02:45:55.300 --> 02:46:00.380]  They've got the cheap food. Everything is very cheap, cheap because they import from
[02:46:00.380 --> 02:46:05.220]  slave labor in China. But the bullets, that was always gonna be a spot where if you let
[02:46:05.220 --> 02:46:08.900]  too many of these things circulate, it would be potentially dangerous. So by hoarding all
[02:46:08.900 --> 02:46:12.580]  the bullets, by buying billions of bullets, they're gonna make a black market in bullets.
[02:46:12.580 --> 02:46:17.100]  I was about to say, the government's trying to buy them up to hoard them cuz they're scared
[02:46:17.100 --> 02:46:22.580]  cuz of all their crimes. But also, I was about to say, but to also-
[02:46:22.580 --> 02:46:28.140]  Black market in drugs, the black market in guns, fast and furious. They're gonna have
[02:46:28.140 --> 02:46:33.300]  a black market in bullets. It's the same crooked insiders on Wall Street in Washington.
[02:46:33.300 --> 02:46:40.000]  But that's what I was gonna say is that they're so out of control, Max, that by buying 2 billion
[02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:45.220]  bullets to try to squeeze up the market, all they're doing is paying to have all the factories
[02:46:45.220 --> 02:46:48.260]  size up to an even greater production level.
[02:46:48.260 --> 02:46:52.440]  Well, I think that the factories will hit a wall and then they'll start to close down
[02:46:52.440 --> 02:46:55.580]  because they're gonna, just like you have any bubble, you have a bullet bubble. When
[02:46:55.580 --> 02:46:59.260]  the bullet bubble bursts, then you won't be able to buy bullets at any price because the
[02:46:59.260 --> 02:47:03.940]  manufacturing is gonna tail off. Just like natural gas fracking in America, natural gas
[02:47:03.940 --> 02:47:06.100]  fracking only lasts about five years.
[02:47:06.100 --> 02:47:10.260]  They're scaling up to do all this fracking up and down across the coast to coast. Well,
[02:47:10.260 --> 02:47:13.700]  fracking only lasts about five years. It's not like a well that you can tap for 50 or
[02:47:13.700 --> 02:47:17.900]  60 years. That's gonna blow up in five or six years. It's a bond bubble. This is a bullet
[02:47:17.900 --> 02:47:21.240]  bubble. The bullet bubble's gonna pop and if you don't, and the government's gonna have
[02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:23.420]  all the bullets, you'll have a gun, but no bullets.
[02:47:23.420 --> 02:47:28.140]  So you're gonna put a spitball in there. You're gonna have a spitball fight with your MAC-10
[02:47:28.140 --> 02:47:29.980]  or TAC-9 or whatever you got.
[02:47:29.980 --> 02:47:34.620]  I disagree with you. We've already gotten way more than we even need. I mean, it's an
[02:47:34.620 --> 02:47:40.380]  armed camp now. I think the founders left that little time bomb for the New World Order.
[02:47:40.380 --> 02:47:44.420]  I wanna take some calls here, Max, but what do you make of the report here? I'm trying
[02:47:44.420 --> 02:47:52.180]  to dig it out. Central banks buy the most gold since 1964. And the source on that is
[02:47:52.180 --> 02:47:58.220]  the New York Stock Exchange and the commodity and metals trading.
[02:47:58.220 --> 02:48:03.700]  Yeah, they start doing that after, in 2009, there was a 40-year reversal where the central
[02:48:03.700 --> 02:48:08.140]  banks became net buyers. They had been net sellers. And the reason why is because they
[02:48:08.140 --> 02:48:13.740]  are all selling massive amounts of bonds to degrade their own currencies as part of the
[02:48:13.740 --> 02:48:17.860]  currency war. They don't trust each other. So they are buying gold because they realize
[02:48:17.860 --> 02:48:22.220]  that the bond bubble and currency bubbles are popping and the gold will once again resume
[02:48:22.220 --> 02:48:27.780]  as being the world reserve currency as it has been before and will again. So the central
[02:48:27.780 --> 02:48:30.100]  banks are buying gold.
[02:48:30.100 --> 02:48:34.820]  Now, here's where things are gonna get interesting because right now, central banks are floating
[02:48:34.820 --> 02:48:38.660]  money to buy bonds. They're also buying gold. But at some point, they're gonna switch. They're
[02:48:38.660 --> 02:48:44.220]  going to print money to buy gold. And then you'll see a hyperbolic move in gold, but
[02:48:44.220 --> 02:48:45.220]  it'll happen very quickly.
[02:48:45.220 --> 02:48:48.580]  When do you expect that to happen?
[02:48:48.580 --> 02:48:53.300]  Well I think my friend Jim Ricker, who I think is the smartest guy in the world when it comes
[02:48:53.300 --> 02:48:58.060]  to gold and currencies, he predicts that when China comes out and announces that they have
[02:48:58.060 --> 02:49:03.340]  4,000 tons of gold, right now they officially have 1,500. But we know that they've been
[02:49:03.340 --> 02:49:05.820]  buying very aggressively for a number of years.
[02:49:05.820 --> 02:49:11.720]  And they should have close to or over 4,000 tons of gold. Once China says, and it's known
[02:49:11.720 --> 02:49:17.040]  that they have 4,000 tons of gold, which on a percentage to their reserves and their population
[02:49:17.040 --> 02:49:22.260]  is critical, then you'll see panic buying in gold around the world. The central banks
[02:49:22.260 --> 02:49:24.500]  will triple and quadruple their panic buying.
[02:49:24.500 --> 02:49:28.420]  But they've probably already reached that. They've just been keeping it quiet per globalist
[02:49:28.420 --> 02:49:29.420]  request.
[02:49:29.420 --> 02:49:37.380]  I agree. So I think, as you know, that we could happen any day, a massive kind of trap
[02:49:37.380 --> 02:49:40.180]  doors open beneath the bond market and gold prices skyrocket.
[02:49:40.180 --> 02:49:44.900]  What's going to happen to places like Southern California when we really go into the depression?
[02:49:44.900 --> 02:49:48.980]  Well price of gas goes higher and we saw when price of oil went to 147 a barrel, you had
[02:49:48.980 --> 02:49:54.260]  people in the suburbs and the exurbs of California running out of gas and calling the police
[02:49:54.260 --> 02:49:59.540]  and saying, what do I do? They didn't make the connection between empty gas tank and
[02:49:59.540 --> 02:50:00.540]  no forward motion.
[02:50:00.540 --> 02:50:01.540]  I love it.
[02:50:01.540 --> 02:50:02.540]  That's how unprepared they are.
[02:50:02.540 --> 02:50:03.540]  You're so helpless.
[02:50:03.540 --> 02:50:12.700]  Yeah. So, so we know what's going to happen. It's not going to be pleasant.
[02:50:12.700 --> 02:50:16.720]  You know, I don't mean to laugh evilly. It actually hurts me. But these gullible idiots
[02:50:16.720 --> 02:50:20.620]  that love the government and love socialism, they just really are the dumbest people on
[02:50:20.620 --> 02:50:21.620]  the planet.
[02:50:21.620 --> 02:50:26.780]  Look, there's a percentage of the population that's not going to make it past this crisis
[02:50:26.780 --> 02:50:33.220]  and we can't be too sentimental about it, but there's just a big piece of the, you know,
[02:50:33.220 --> 02:50:37.340]  make your friends and, and do what you have to do. But a lot of the percentage of the
[02:50:37.340 --> 02:50:39.500]  population is just not going to make it.
[02:50:39.500 --> 02:50:43.380]  Yeah. Cause sucking your thumbs, I'm going to get you through what's coming. Oh man.
[02:50:43.380 --> 02:50:47.100]  I just, it's, it's, it's folks. If you think things are crazy now, you ain't seen nothing
[02:50:47.100 --> 02:50:48.100]  yet. We are.
[02:50:48.100 --> 02:50:52.460]  Here's a good example. You were talking about being prepared and being laughed at and then
[02:50:52.460 --> 02:50:57.580]  the hurricanes hit and the people who had actually had the canned food actually did
[02:50:57.580 --> 02:50:58.740]  very well.
[02:50:58.740 --> 02:51:01.220]  Stay there. Max calls coming up. Stay with us. Max Keiser.

[02:54:16.020 --> 02:54:20.640]  You know, this hour is brought to you by the Squatty Putty. It's actually not one of my
[02:54:20.640 --> 02:54:23.940]  sponsors but Max Keiser is in there and now you're not going to get any serious news out
[02:54:23.940 --> 02:54:31.300]  of him because you're in the Squatty Putty ad. So ridiculous. Anyways, I find myself
[02:54:31.300 --> 02:54:34.780]  laughing more and more because stuff's getting so crazy and now I realize I've been right
[02:54:34.780 --> 02:54:38.500]  about almost everything and it's going to get as bad as I think it's going to get and
[02:54:38.500 --> 02:54:42.820]  the general public still has no idea. I said we'd take a few calls here in just this short
[02:54:42.820 --> 02:54:46.540]  segment and a little bit of overdrive because he's got to go give some nighttime speech.
[02:54:46.540 --> 02:54:51.060]  He's doing stand-up now if he's not joking. Are you seriously going to do a stand-up speech
[02:54:51.060 --> 02:54:54.980]  tonight in London or are you really going to secretly be in there using a Squatty Putty?
[02:54:54.980 --> 02:55:01.700]  Look, I'm combining the Squatty Putty with my own compost-generating mechanism. You got
[02:55:01.700 --> 02:55:08.180]  to get both. It's a combo deal. You make your own compost with your Squatty Putty and this
[02:55:08.180 --> 02:55:15.420]  is how to be sustainable. This is what the truth. Al Gore probably has a Squatty Putty.
[02:55:15.420 --> 02:55:19.060]  That's enough. Let's go to Joe in Florida. Joe, you're on the air with the inventor of
[02:55:19.060 --> 02:55:27.380]  the Squatty Putty. Go ahead. Yeah. Are you there? Yes, sir. We're on Squatty Putty, both
[02:55:27.380 --> 02:55:31.740]  of us. I'm going to stop now. Yes, you're on the air with Max Keiser. Go ahead. I want
[02:55:31.740 --> 02:55:36.260]  to thank you for the saggedy Sam cheer up. I'm glad to hear you're cheering up, Alex.
[02:55:36.260 --> 02:55:41.980]  It's great to talk to you. Hey, the whole world's going to hell in a handbasket. Yeah!
[02:55:41.980 --> 02:55:48.100]  And Obama raised taxes on the poor people because he loves them. Yeah! Nice guy. I'm
[02:55:48.100 --> 02:55:55.380]  sorry. Well, I can eat my peas. You know, I wanted to talk about the gun manufacturing
[02:55:55.380 --> 02:56:00.540]  across the world globally and what I wanted to talk about-
[02:56:00.540 --> 02:56:03.580]  Well, go quick because we're almost out of time. I mean, you had a question for Max Keiser?
[02:56:03.580 --> 02:56:09.820]  Yeah, you gave me a question. On the industrial aspects of the firearms and all these names
[02:56:09.820 --> 02:56:16.540]  like Remington who say America's oldest gun maker and now they're actually made all across
[02:56:16.540 --> 02:56:21.420]  the world like Belgium and Turkey and we're supposed to go to Gander Mountain and support
[02:56:21.420 --> 02:56:27.700]  places like China and Russia. America's oldest gun maker like Remington. Are you kidding
[02:56:27.700 --> 02:56:31.380]  me? Really? No, I hear you. Listen, I appreciate your call, Joe, but I don't-
[02:56:31.380 --> 02:56:34.660]  New caller, new caller, new caller. I appreciate it, Joe, but I don't get the question for
[02:56:34.660 --> 02:56:38.340]  Max Keiser. New caller, no question. New caller. Dump
[02:56:38.340 --> 02:56:41.740]  them, dump them, new line, new car. All right, let's go to Mark in Canada. You're
[02:56:41.740 --> 02:56:44.180]  on there with Max Keiser, also known as the obnoxious one.
[02:56:44.180 --> 02:56:47.540]  What's going to be a question, Mark? Are we going to come after you at the Squatty Potty?
[02:56:47.540 --> 02:56:55.420]  I live up in Dunster, BC, and I watch you all the time on RT and as well on press TV
[02:56:55.420 --> 02:57:01.500]  through a satellite called the Frida Air System. Yes, sir, Mr. Squatty Potty, do you have a
[02:57:01.500 --> 02:57:03.060]  question for Max Keiser? I do.
[02:57:03.060 --> 02:57:07.020]  I think he's trying to say that he likes my show best, better than any other show.
[02:57:07.020 --> 02:57:10.700]  That's right, that's what it is. That's a good point, and I'd like to emphasize
[02:57:10.700 --> 02:57:11.700]  that point. Let's get serious.
[02:57:11.700 --> 02:57:14.820]  It is the best show in the world. When he heard that ad, folks, Max is a funny
[02:57:14.820 --> 02:57:19.460]  guy. It was over at that point. Now he's gone into after work mode. I guess it is late over
[02:57:19.460 --> 02:57:23.060]  there in England. Caller, you got a question for Max, because it's past his bedtime.
[02:57:23.060 --> 02:57:28.740]  Yeah, I wanted to talk about silver. And the movement that I've been doing in my life is,
[02:57:28.740 --> 02:57:32.460]  of course, rather than being paid in debt, which would be paper. I like to be paid in
[02:57:32.460 --> 02:57:37.620]  silver. Of course, I've had to remove myself from the social insurance system, but I think
[02:57:37.620 --> 02:57:42.460]  wouldn't that be a real good resolution to the system, rather than everyone being-
[02:57:42.460 --> 02:57:47.580]  I agree. Alternate currencies, get out of the paper as much as you can. Get out of the
[02:57:47.580 --> 02:57:51.500]  system. Max Keiser, how do we bring down the globalist?
[02:57:51.500 --> 02:57:59.580]  I believe, and I've been talking to silver miners and gold miners, they could be a huge
[02:57:59.580 --> 02:58:07.660]  amount of plus to the global economy and everyone if they started paying dividends in bullion.
[02:58:07.660 --> 02:58:14.700]  So if you bought Goldcorp or Endeavor Silver, which is a Canadian company, instead of getting
[02:58:14.700 --> 02:58:21.560]  a dollar every quarter in cash, you got the equivalent in bullion. That would take those
[02:58:21.560 --> 02:58:26.900]  stocks higher. It would move money into that sector. It would recognize gold and silver
[02:58:26.900 --> 02:58:31.980]  as a currency, and I've been lobbying behind the scenes for this to happen, but they haven't
[02:58:31.980 --> 02:58:33.580]  done it yet. They should.
