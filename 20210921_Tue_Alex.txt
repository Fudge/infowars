[00:00.000 --> 00:16.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, what is it going to be that breaks the back of the COVID-19 vaccine
[00:16.880 --> 00:22.000]  mandates and all the lies?
[00:22.000 --> 00:28.480]  Alex Jones is in the building, he's just landed, he's coming up just shortly, but folks what
[00:28.480 --> 00:29.560]  is it going to be?
[00:29.560 --> 00:31.080]  Think about everything we've seen.
[00:31.080 --> 00:39.720]  First of all, the idea of forced medication should already be illegal and despised, but
[00:39.720 --> 00:41.320]  I guess we've passed that.
[00:41.320 --> 00:47.080]  Moderna says, if you've taken the vaccine, you're twice as likely to get COVID, whether
[00:47.080 --> 00:52.680]  it's Oscar de la Jolla or Chris Rock or an Olympic gold medal swimmer from Australia.
[00:52.680 --> 00:57.400]  You get the COVID vaccine, you get COVID, you end up in the ICU.
[00:57.400 --> 01:00.600]  Whereas if you don't get the vaccine, you get COVID, you recover in a couple days, you're
[01:00.600 --> 01:01.600]  just fine.
[01:01.600 --> 01:08.920]  But now, Project Veritas from inside the hospitals has doctors and nurses telling undercover
[01:08.920 --> 01:14.440]  journalists unknowingly that the vaccine is BS, it doesn't work, and it's all a lie.
[01:14.440 --> 01:15.440]  Here's a short clip.
[01:15.440 --> 01:16.440]  I bet you it just hasn't.
[01:16.440 --> 01:25.200]  The government doesn't want to show that the darn vaccine is full of it's full of ****.
[01:25.200 --> 01:27.800]  Tell us about who this person is.
[01:27.800 --> 01:32.640]  Dr. Gonzalez is one of our emergency room doctors at Phoenix Indian Medical Center.
[01:32.640 --> 01:33.640]  And she's a federal employee?
[01:33.640 --> 01:34.640]  Correct.
[01:34.640 --> 01:41.080]  Now you got this guy in room four who got his second dose of vaccine on Tuesday, has
[01:41.080 --> 01:42.080]  been short of breath.
[01:42.080 --> 01:43.080]  He's got a myocarditis.
[01:43.080 --> 01:44.080]  Yes.
[01:44.080 --> 01:45.080]  Oh, this is ****.
[01:45.080 --> 01:46.080]  And now, let's see.
[01:46.080 --> 01:51.040]  I don't want to leave myocarditis due to the vaccine, right.
[01:51.040 --> 01:53.080]  But now they're not going to blame the vaccine.
[01:53.080 --> 01:56.880]  Well, and you know what, but he has an obligation to report that, doesn't he?
[01:56.880 --> 01:58.360]  They are not reporting, right?
[01:58.360 --> 02:04.160]  Because they want to show it under the, under the, the, the, the map.
[02:04.160 --> 02:05.560]  What patient was she referring to?
[02:05.560 --> 02:11.200]  She was referring to that patient, that 30 something year old patient that had congestive
[02:11.200 --> 02:12.200]  heart failure.
[02:12.200 --> 02:13.200]  Congestive heart failure.
[02:13.200 --> 02:15.440]  And in that particular patient's case, it was not reported.
[02:15.440 --> 02:16.440]  No.
[02:16.440 --> 02:23.880]  They are not doing the studies, people that had it, you know, and the people that have
[02:23.880 --> 02:30.560]  been, uh, uh, vaccinated, they're not doing any, um, antibody testing.
[02:30.560 --> 02:31.560]  It's super fishy.
[02:31.560 --> 02:33.720]  Not that it has them done.
[02:33.720 --> 02:34.720]  It has them unpublished.
[02:34.720 --> 02:40.960]  It hasn't probably been done because the government doesn't want to show that the
[02:40.960 --> 02:44.400]  done vaccine is full of ****.
[02:44.400 --> 02:48.440]  The government doesn't want to show that the vaccine is full of ****.
[02:48.440 --> 02:51.240]  It's not doing what it, it's purpose was.
[02:51.240 --> 02:54.520]  May I see your badges?
[02:54.520 --> 02:58.600]  You're Jody O'Malley with the Department of Health and Human Services.
[02:58.600 --> 03:00.880]  This is the United States government identification.
[03:00.880 --> 03:02.800]  I'm looking at the CDC website.
[03:02.800 --> 03:08.040]  It says that you're required to report adverse events following vaccinations.
[03:08.040 --> 03:11.400]  One of those would be, uh, congestive heart failure.
[03:11.400 --> 03:12.400]  That's a huge one.
[03:12.400 --> 03:15.400]  There are other instances that they, they didn't report.
[03:15.400 --> 03:20.560]  Oh, I've seen dozens of people come in with an adverse reaction.
[03:20.560 --> 03:22.040]  Yeah, it's really sad.
[03:22.040 --> 03:26.160]  She had just come back from surgery from leave.
[03:26.160 --> 03:29.040]  So what are we looking at here?
[03:29.040 --> 03:37.520]  You're looking at me transferring her, um, to a higher level of care that could handle
[03:37.520 --> 03:38.920]  her condition.
[03:38.920 --> 03:43.040]  And this is a co, a colleague at your hospital who got sick.
[03:43.040 --> 03:48.240]  She didn't want to take it because of her religious beliefs.
[03:48.240 --> 03:51.360]  And she was coerced into taking it.
[03:51.360 --> 03:53.760]  Why are you choosing to blow the whistle?
[03:53.760 --> 03:55.920]  It's not what a lot of people would do.
[03:55.920 --> 03:56.920]  They're scared.
[03:56.920 --> 03:58.240]  They're afraid.
[03:58.240 --> 03:59.240]  Are you afraid?
[03:59.240 --> 04:05.720]  I wouldn't necessarily say I'm afraid because my faith lies in God and not man.
[04:05.720 --> 04:09.080]  This is evil at the highest level.
[04:09.080 --> 04:15.600]  You have the FDA, you have the CDC that are both supposed to be protecting us.
[04:15.600 --> 04:18.640]  Are you afraid they're going to retaliate against you?
[04:18.640 --> 04:19.640]  Yeah.
[04:19.640 --> 04:20.640]  I'm a federal employee.
[04:20.640 --> 04:22.680]  What other federal employees do you see coming out?
[04:22.680 --> 04:24.400]  But you put your faith in God.
[04:24.400 --> 04:25.400]  Amen.
[04:25.400 --> 04:29.800]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen, that's just a small clip.
[04:29.800 --> 04:36.680]  The full video is about 13 minutes, COVID vaccine exposed from inside the hospitals
[04:36.680 --> 04:44.160]  with federal government workers calling it out as a hoax and a tool of death.
[04:44.160 --> 04:47.520]  So she says the vaccine isn't doing what it was intended to do.
[04:47.520 --> 04:49.400]  Sadly, yes, it is.
[04:49.400 --> 04:54.640]  It's killed 15,000 people so far this year that they've admitted, that they've actually
[04:54.640 --> 04:55.640]  admitted to.
[04:55.640 --> 05:01.040]  I'll tell you what's life and death.
[05:01.040 --> 05:05.880]  If you don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the right to be able to communicate,
[05:05.880 --> 05:08.240]  then you don't have a future.
[05:08.240 --> 05:11.640]  Always when governments take away speech, they then enslave the population and then
[05:11.640 --> 05:13.800]  they finally start exterminating the population.
[05:13.800 --> 05:18.400]  And America, the entire world is going down the tubes because of the UN, global is directed,
[05:18.400 --> 05:19.400]  great reset.
[05:19.400 --> 05:22.480]  That's why it's more important than ever that info or stay on the air and that all
[05:22.480 --> 05:23.480]  of us stay healthy.
[05:23.480 --> 05:28.200]  That's why I'm offering a bunch of our best selling products at 50% off for a limited
[05:28.200 --> 05:31.800]  time only until the end of the month of September.
[05:31.800 --> 05:35.640]  That's only about 12, 13 days as of the time we're taping this.
[05:35.640 --> 05:40.440]  And that means all of these amazing products, we have ultra 12, highest quality B12, taking
[05:40.440 --> 05:41.440]  out of the tongue.
[05:41.440 --> 05:45.160]  We have winter sun, highest quality organic vitamin D3, taking out of the tongue.
[05:45.160 --> 05:46.160]  Amazing.
[05:46.160 --> 05:47.160]  We've got knock out the sleep pay.
[05:47.160 --> 05:49.680]  We've got hair and beard formula that's got all the vitamins and minerals as well, not
[05:49.680 --> 05:50.680]  just hair and beard.
[05:50.680 --> 05:56.000]  And we've got our great liquid turmeric formula all 50% off at infowarstore.com and it keeps
[05:56.000 --> 05:57.000]  us on the air.
[05:57.000 --> 05:58.000]  Take action.
[05:58.000 --> 06:00.000]  And I thank you.
[06:00.000 --> 06:13.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[06:13.000 --> 06:21.680]  front lines of the info war.
[06:21.680 --> 06:34.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's a historic September 21, 2021 because Joe Biden at the UN has announced
[06:34.400 --> 06:42.880]  this is the fact totem of a president, the Biden regime that is in the White House, announced
[06:42.880 --> 06:48.800]  to the UN today that America surrenders to the new world order.
[06:48.800 --> 06:49.800]  That's right.
[06:49.800 --> 06:54.760]  Joe Biden today in a speech that he was fumbling and stammering through, of course, announced
[06:54.760 --> 07:00.520]  to the world and to the UN that he surrenders the United States of America and our sovereignty
[07:00.520 --> 07:06.120]  and our prosperity to the will of the new world order.
[07:06.120 --> 07:11.880]  Now, having said that, the American people are more awake than ever before.
[07:11.880 --> 07:18.160]  You just saw a short clip from the most recent project Veritas video from inside hospitals
[07:18.160 --> 07:23.960]  with a federal health worker whistleblower telling you everybody knows the vaccine is
[07:23.960 --> 07:28.560]  BS, everybody knows it's not working, everybody knows it's causing heart attacks and killing
[07:28.560 --> 07:32.880]  people and they're all covering it up and they don't know what to do about it.
[07:32.880 --> 07:37.720]  They see the death, they see the side effects, they know everyone that's coming in with COVID
[07:37.720 --> 07:41.720]  that goes into the ICU has been vaccinated and they don't get it.
[07:41.720 --> 07:47.440]  Well, it's time to take the next leap, ladies and gentlemen, COVID was created in a lab.
[07:47.440 --> 07:53.280]  It was then used to lock down the planet and destroy the economic systems of the West.
[07:53.280 --> 07:58.800]  It was also then used to bring in the vaccine that is actually causing now the vaccine variant
[07:58.800 --> 07:59.800]  pandemic.
[07:59.800 --> 08:03.920]  Most people that get the vaccine variant still aren't going to die, but they're panicked
[08:03.920 --> 08:07.400]  because the media tells them it's the worst, the most deadly virus ever.
[08:07.400 --> 08:13.920]  So they go to the ICU, they get remdesivir, it ruins their kidneys, fills their lungs
[08:13.920 --> 08:18.920]  with liquid and then they get put on a ventilator and their lungs blowed out and killed.
[08:18.920 --> 08:24.560]  You did not see an increase in the percentage of the death in the United States of America
[08:24.560 --> 08:28.640]  in 2020, the year of the deadly pandemic, not a single percentage increase in the death
[08:28.640 --> 08:29.640]  rate.
[08:29.640 --> 08:34.960]  I do predict you will see an increase in the death rate in the year 2021 because of
[08:34.960 --> 08:37.960]  the vaccines.
[08:37.960 --> 08:46.520]  Now Black Lives Matter in the year 2020 was able to engage in complete lawlessness and
[08:46.520 --> 08:50.440]  criminality, whether it was in the name of George Floyd or somebody else that the media
[08:50.440 --> 08:52.640]  built up.
[08:52.640 --> 08:57.720]  And of course we saw what happened last year, but now Black Lives Matter is standing up
[08:57.720 --> 09:04.280]  against vaccine mandates, having demonstrations and protests against vaccine mandates.
[09:04.280 --> 09:10.520]  Well if Black Lives Matter starts to loot and riot and assault against vaccine mandates,
[09:10.520 --> 09:13.120]  will the media still call it mostly peaceful?
[09:13.120 --> 09:16.120]  Will law enforcement be told to stand down and let it happen?
[09:16.120 --> 09:17.880]  We may find out.
[09:17.880 --> 09:19.400]  We may find out indeed.
[09:19.400 --> 09:25.480]  Can Americans finally come together against this forced medication with an on record deadly
[09:25.480 --> 09:29.720]  vaccine that they knew would cause death before they even released it?
[09:29.720 --> 09:33.520]  We have the PowerPoints from October.
[09:33.520 --> 09:35.120]  What an incredible time to be alive.
[09:35.120 --> 09:41.080]  The juxtaposition of Joe Biden sitting in the White House with the Biden regime surrendering
[09:41.080 --> 09:46.120]  the United States to the New World Order today as America is waking up and becoming more
[09:46.120 --> 09:54.680]  empowered as citizens than ever before, realizing the assaults against our civil rights.
[09:54.680 --> 10:01.200]  Owen Schreuer sitting in for Alex Jones right now, but Alex Jones is in the building and
[10:01.200 --> 10:06.920]  he will be joining us very shortly to break all of this down, not to mention what's happening
[10:06.920 --> 10:12.000]  in Brazil where Balzanaro is now the leader of the free world.
[10:12.000 --> 10:18.920]  Balzanaro it turns out is everything that Donald Trump, well or I guess I should say
[10:18.920 --> 10:22.640]  everything we wish Donald Trump would have been.
[10:22.640 --> 10:28.520]  Brazilian president, guys put that headline back up from News Wars, thank you.
[10:28.520 --> 10:32.360]  Brazilian president Balzanaro forced to eat pizza on sidewalk in New York because he's
[10:32.360 --> 10:34.600]  not vaccinated.
[10:34.600 --> 10:39.880]  Now they have this big UN General Assembly in New York where all of the elite have gathered.
[10:39.880 --> 10:44.960]  No travel restrictions, no mass mandates, no vaccine mandates for them, but for you,
[10:44.960 --> 10:51.200]  the slave, for you, the prisoner, you're subjected to the medical tyranny but not the global
[10:51.200 --> 10:52.200]  elite.
[10:52.200 --> 10:57.080]  And Balzanaro is now the only one in a position of leadership on the world stage standing
[10:57.080 --> 10:58.680]  against it.
[10:58.680 --> 11:06.000]  We salute Balzanaro, we salute our Brazilians fighting for freedom.
[11:06.000 --> 11:11.640]  Brazilians unvaccinated Balzanaro appears to break UN vaccine honor system during address.
[11:11.640 --> 11:16.560]  No, none of them have been vaccinated, that's why it wasn't a mandate for the UN General
[11:16.560 --> 11:17.560]  Assembly.
[11:17.560 --> 11:22.240]  Balzanaro is the only one that's being honest about it.
[11:22.240 --> 11:26.640]  And then of course, you just saw it in the Project Veritas video, federal government
[11:26.640 --> 11:31.760]  whistleblower goes public with secret recordings, government doesn't want to show the COVID vaccine
[11:31.760 --> 11:37.000]  is full of shit, shove adverse effect reporting under the mat.
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.880]  Now folks, I know I'm not about to curse, I'm a journalist.
[11:39.880 --> 11:47.200]  This is what is said by the federal worker in the video that the vaccine is full of crap.
[11:47.200 --> 11:51.520]  Now I'm censoring myself.
[11:51.520 --> 11:53.280]  What is it going to take?
[11:53.280 --> 12:00.640]  I interviewed a reporter and former police officer from Australia this morning, where
[12:00.640 --> 12:06.080]  the scenes in Australia are getting worse and worse by the day something has to give
[12:06.080 --> 12:07.080]  in Australia.
[12:07.080 --> 12:08.080]  What is going to break first?
[12:08.080 --> 12:15.840]  We saw violent confrontations and combat between Australian citizens and police today.
[12:15.840 --> 12:19.760]  This is what the new world order is setting up, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:19.760 --> 12:23.760]  You need to understand it's now been announced by Biden today.
[12:23.760 --> 12:31.240]  The world elite that the left claims to stand against, you know, the tax the rich, how the
[12:31.240 --> 12:38.160]  0.1% have 99% of the world's wealth, you know, those old talking points.
[12:38.160 --> 12:45.320]  They have created a situation where they are building a breakaway civilization.
[12:45.320 --> 12:47.560]  They have no need for us anymore.
[12:47.560 --> 12:51.440]  They've experimented on us enough to have their new technologies and life extension
[12:51.440 --> 12:53.080]  technologies.
[12:53.080 --> 12:59.160]  And they're now, in the case of Australia, attempting to incite a civil war between the
[12:59.160 --> 13:00.960]  police and the citizens.
[13:00.960 --> 13:01.960]  Something has to give.
[13:01.960 --> 13:03.640]  The citizens have had enough.
[13:03.640 --> 13:08.120]  Will the police willingly be the foot soldiers for the new world order or will they stand
[13:08.120 --> 13:09.120]  down?
[13:09.120 --> 13:11.960]  I think we're going to find out soon.
[13:11.960 --> 13:18.840]  But understand this, the world elite have been building and are now ready to execute
[13:18.840 --> 13:24.240]  the next phase of their breakaway civilization from the rest of humanity.
[13:24.240 --> 13:28.440]  And all the stuff that you're seeing, all the death from the vaccines, the viruses being
[13:28.440 --> 13:33.120]  made in labs, the pitting humans against one another, whether it's skin color or law
[13:33.120 --> 13:37.400]  enforcement versus civilians, it's all part of the global agenda.
[13:37.400 --> 13:38.840]  Biden announced it today.
[13:38.840 --> 13:42.280]  He said in the next 10 years, the world has to change.
[13:42.280 --> 13:45.760]  It's going to be a decisive time, meaning the world elite are about to take over the
[13:45.760 --> 13:51.880]  planet, put you into a prison-type system, force inoculate you with deadly vaccines and
[13:51.880 --> 14:01.080]  have complete control over your body, your travel, your speech, and all of your rights
[14:01.080 --> 14:06.320]  as you know them will be gone if they are successful.
[14:06.320 --> 14:10.360]  But just like what you're seeing in Australia with the citizens being pit against the police
[14:10.360 --> 14:14.440]  and that's now getting violent, the whole world is starting to wake up to this, ladies
[14:14.440 --> 14:15.440]  and gentlemen.
[14:15.440 --> 14:21.400]  And here's the thing, Info Wars has been the tip of the spear in alerting the planet that
[14:21.400 --> 14:22.600]  this is happening.
[14:22.600 --> 14:28.440]  We are now in the phase of this plan that is so obvious, most people are now starting
[14:28.440 --> 14:31.140]  to see what's going on.
[14:31.140 --> 14:34.240]  This is why Info Wars was targeted for censorship.
[14:34.240 --> 14:37.960]  This is why Info Wars is attacked so much, much of the stuff that goes on behind the
[14:37.960 --> 14:40.600]  scenes, which you may never even know about.
[14:40.600 --> 14:43.480]  Maybe someday we'll be able to talk about it.
[14:43.480 --> 14:48.040]  But this is the current state of the planet, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:48.040 --> 14:53.800]  And I think it's going to come a time in the very, very near future where there is no more
[14:53.800 --> 14:54.800]  hedging.
[14:54.800 --> 14:56.400]  There is no more neutral ground.
[14:56.400 --> 14:58.920]  You're going to have to draw a line in the sand and you're going to have to decide which
[14:58.920 --> 15:01.200]  line of the sand that you're going to stand on.
[15:01.200 --> 15:03.280]  Now, a lot of people have already decided.
[15:03.280 --> 15:07.800]  I'm with the globalists, I'm with the New World Order, I'm with the big government,
[15:07.800 --> 15:10.680]  I want to be a slave, I want to live in fear.
[15:10.680 --> 15:14.600]  For whatever reason, you've witnessed that.
[15:14.600 --> 15:19.680]  But everybody in this audience is going to have to make some serious choices in the very
[15:19.680 --> 15:25.440]  near future about what planet they want to live on in humanity's time on this planet
[15:25.440 --> 15:26.440]  going forward.
[15:26.440 --> 15:29.200]  Do you want to be a slave to medical tyranny?
[15:29.200 --> 15:31.920]  Do you want to live in a prison planet?
[15:31.920 --> 15:35.040]  Do you want the government telling you how to live your life?
[15:35.040 --> 15:40.000]  Do you want to be ruled by world elite, rich elite?
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.080]  Or do you believe that you have the right to self-government, the right to free speech,
[15:45.080 --> 15:47.600]  the right to self-defense, and everything else?
[15:47.600 --> 15:52.480]  Alex Jones in the House, joining us in four minutes.
[15:52.480 --> 15:57.720]  Historic times, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back.
[15:57.720 --> 16:02.120]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[16:02.120 --> 16:06.240]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[16:06.240 --> 16:07.240]  Here's why.
[16:07.240 --> 16:11.200]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[16:11.200 --> 16:16.240]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[16:16.240 --> 16:21.400]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and
[16:21.400 --> 16:25.320]  produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:25.320 --> 16:29.280]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the
[16:29.280 --> 16:34.000]  grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:34.000 --> 16:40.040]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-grid bonuses too.
[16:40.040 --> 16:43.960]  Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[16:43.960 --> 16:45.920]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[16:45.920 --> 16:50.520]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk,
[16:50.520 --> 16:54.400]  and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[16:54.400 --> 16:56.520]  Here's free at mysolarbackup.com.
[16:56.520 --> 16:58.160]  Hey everybody.
[16:58.160 --> 17:03.120]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great
[17:03.120 --> 17:04.120]  news.
[17:04.120 --> 17:06.200]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[17:06.200 --> 17:07.200]  Here's the thing.
[17:07.200 --> 17:12.720]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans, survival soup beans.
[17:12.720 --> 17:18.000]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever,
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.800]  the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[17:20.800 --> 17:26.480]  Best part, we've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food
[17:26.480 --> 17:31.240]  prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[17:31.240 --> 17:32.240]  Gets even better.
[17:32.240 --> 17:36.920]  With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want
[17:36.920 --> 17:42.160]  to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the
[17:42.160 --> 17:43.160]  world, period.
[17:43.160 --> 17:49.620]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com, and discover the real reason we're giving
[17:49.620 --> 17:55.720]  this unusual superfood away at soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com.
[01:37.620 --> 18:24.080]  five I's, the Russians, and the Chinese, he wanted the world to know that
[18:24.080 --> 18:28.280]  he was proud of what he was doing because he was backed by the deep state.
[18:28.280 --> 18:32.480]  This permanent bureaucracy sees America as its enemy, it sees the American people as
[18:32.480 --> 18:37.780]  its enemy, it sees prosperity as its enemy, and it conspired with the Communist Chinese
[18:37.780 --> 18:42.700]  to threaten them basically and say, Trump may nuke you, let it be tries, we'll call
[18:42.700 --> 18:45.860]  and say we're attacking you so you can respond first.
[18:45.860 --> 18:50.240]  That's beyond treason, but it shows the type of anti-American sycophants living in their
[18:50.240 --> 18:53.480]  own fetid bubble that try to get away with this.
[18:53.480 --> 19:00.360]  Millie and all of his accomplices need to go to prison now for life.
[19:00.360 --> 19:05.880]  If you think the puppet president, Joe Biden, coming out and announcing that 100 million
[19:05.880 --> 19:11.760]  Americans are going to be forced to take experimental shots or lose their jobs, understand we know
[19:11.760 --> 19:15.480]  the blueprint of the UN, they've stated their plan.
[19:15.480 --> 19:20.320]  The tracers coming to your house, 10 forced injections a year, the destruction of your
[19:20.320 --> 19:26.480]  immune system, the depopulation of the planet, and the vaccine passport on your, quote, iPhone
[19:26.480 --> 19:31.040]  or droid, tracking and tracing everything you do and telling you when you can go outside
[19:31.040 --> 19:35.960]  of your house or where you can go, not just for COVID-19, but for carbon taxes.
[19:35.960 --> 19:39.520]  So as I've said a thousand times, submission is death.
[19:39.520 --> 19:43.400]  You give in to this just for your job, or to be able to go to the bar, or to be able
[19:43.400 --> 19:48.320]  to quote, fly an airplane, then they're going to slowly put the screws in with these apps
[19:48.320 --> 19:53.000]  on your phone to control where you go and what you do and dog train you right in total
[19:53.000 --> 19:54.000]  slavery.
[19:54.000 --> 20:02.440]  This is criminal, it's illegal, it's tyranny, and we must resist and not comply.
[20:02.440 --> 20:18.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:18.240 --> 20:28.400]  Okay, so I got off the airplane at the airport about 30 minutes ago and the crew got me here
[20:28.400 --> 20:33.160]  very, very quickly and I just skidded into my chair here with Owen Schreuer, but sometimes
[20:33.160 --> 20:40.240]  here on the Alex Jones show, sometimes I have my best broadcasts when I haven't actually
[20:40.240 --> 20:43.200]  gotten super prepared because I tend to get prepared at night and they're in the morning
[20:43.200 --> 20:47.320]  and then get in here and go over the huge stacks of news here, that's why you saw those
[20:47.320 --> 20:50.640]  big stacks that had not even been looked at because Owen did his own research where he
[20:50.640 --> 20:55.320]  came on and he's going to be hosting his own broadcast three to six p.m. central standard
[20:55.320 --> 20:56.320]  time today.
[20:56.320 --> 20:58.800]  Hey, guys, what Owen's like, you know, is that TV's off right there?
[20:58.800 --> 21:01.680]  No big deal, but just a heads up on that.
[21:01.680 --> 21:05.240]  So here we are, ladies and gentlemen, what a time to be here.
[21:05.240 --> 21:07.680]  I'm very blessed to be back in Austin, Texas.
[21:07.680 --> 21:15.760]  I was in D.C. and then I drove through the beautiful mountain country there in the Appalachians
[21:15.760 --> 21:21.760]  to be on Tim Pool's show right on the border of West Virginia and Maryland and that was
[21:21.760 --> 21:22.760]  really interesting.
[21:22.760 --> 21:26.720]  I worked four hours with him last night, this regular podcast and a couple of hours on his
[21:26.720 --> 21:32.400]  subscription podcast and I have a lot of things to say, also read on the flight back
[21:32.400 --> 21:36.760]  this morning and scanned over three newspapers and it's just unbelievable, the general public's
[21:36.760 --> 21:37.760]  reading and these things.
[21:37.760 --> 21:40.640]  I mean, I could, in fact, when I do a podcast three days a week, I'm going to start doing
[21:40.640 --> 21:44.160]  a night to be commercial free just for, you know, folks to watch.
[21:44.160 --> 21:46.920]  I'm going to have a deal where I just look at what's in newspapers because we look at
[21:46.920 --> 21:49.880]  all the news online, all the video clips, everything and kind of look at the leftist
[21:49.880 --> 21:54.320]  sites, mainstream sites, government sites, documents, legislation, what people shoot,
[21:54.320 --> 21:57.760]  video they get, what people say on Twitter, Facebook, wide spectrum.
[21:57.760 --> 22:04.520]  But man, for folks, open up newspapers, it is just bonkers BS like, oh my gosh, the Pfizer
[22:04.520 --> 22:09.600]  shots totally still effective and it's totally effective in children, you'll never get COVID-19.
[22:09.600 --> 22:14.880]  They're still lying at the level Biden is where it's totally protected, total lie.
[22:14.880 --> 22:19.460]  I mean, it is crazy plus potty training cows.
[22:19.460 --> 22:22.320]  That was in the Washington Post science section.
[22:22.320 --> 22:26.520]  They're not just connecting class to me bags to cows because their defecation, they say
[22:26.520 --> 22:28.600]  toxic because they put off methane.
[22:28.600 --> 22:30.560]  There's always been animals putting off methane.
[22:30.560 --> 22:34.920]  There's always been wild bovine from the water buffalo, the world to the, to the yaks to
[22:34.920 --> 22:40.200]  the, to the bison here on our planes, in fact, just as many bovines they have now, but it's
[22:40.200 --> 22:41.200]  all just a lie.
[22:41.200 --> 22:43.920]  Oh, everything animals do is evil now.
[22:43.920 --> 22:49.840]  So in Germany in places, they now make the cows or they shock them, go into a bathroom
[22:49.840 --> 22:53.640]  stall where they contain all the methane and everything, and I, because it's all evil.
[22:53.640 --> 22:55.920]  Anything a carbon based life form puts off is evil.
[22:55.920 --> 22:57.560]  I have that stack right here.
[22:57.560 --> 22:58.560]  That's the kind of stuff I have.
[22:58.560 --> 22:59.720]  Look, look right here.
[22:59.720 --> 23:05.600]  Will consumers find uns upcycled food appetizing dumpster food on your plate.
[23:05.600 --> 23:06.600]  The newest 20 thing.
[23:06.600 --> 23:09.560]  And then this, this is all into 21 to 20, 30 clock swab stuff.
[23:09.560 --> 23:14.640]  And then right next to it, to fight climate change, scientists potty trained cows.
[23:14.640 --> 23:19.960]  So see, I am not, I am not making any of this stuff.
[23:19.960 --> 23:22.680]  Oh, and we're going to get into it all here today.
[23:22.680 --> 23:24.760]  What do you make of just the crazy time we're in?
[23:24.760 --> 23:30.560]  Don't you understand, Alex, this planet is for Bill Gates and Clow Schwab only for cows,
[23:30.560 --> 23:35.840]  not for cows, not for dogs, not for humans, only the global elite, Alex, you will take
[23:35.840 --> 23:41.040]  their deadly vaccines, you will lock yourself in your home until you die and you will eat
[23:41.040 --> 23:43.520]  little tiny plant based protein bars.
[23:43.520 --> 23:46.960]  You'll get one a day and you're going to shut up and be a good slave, Alex.
[23:46.960 --> 23:53.520]  And it's now official because I read the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington
[23:53.520 --> 23:54.520]  Post.
[23:54.520 --> 23:55.520]  Okay.
[23:55.520 --> 23:58.800]  So I picked those up before we got on the plane, the ice, just the trash of the world.
[23:58.800 --> 24:02.480]  And I mean, my brain after three and a half hours flying back, the plug has been sucked
[24:02.480 --> 24:03.480]  out of my head.
[24:03.480 --> 24:08.520]  I'm quite watching the view for half an hour and they had this whole article just groveling
[24:08.520 --> 24:13.720]  to Xi Jinping, but saying, oh, he's bitch slapped us, but that's okay.
[24:13.720 --> 24:14.800]  He's a real communist.
[24:14.800 --> 24:16.520]  We wish we were like him.
[24:16.520 --> 24:21.560]  I mean, this is just fruit loop level and oh, communism works so well.
[24:21.560 --> 24:26.440]  That's why China is at a 10% growth rate until recently to the last five years and it's still
[24:26.440 --> 24:31.840]  at six or 7% and it's just, no, because they did one sided trade deals where all our jobs
[24:31.840 --> 24:33.640]  went there because the globalist brokered it.
[24:33.640 --> 24:38.920]  I mean, the crap they feed people, mainstream news is basically cyanide.
[24:38.920 --> 24:39.920]  Cyanide to freedom.
[24:39.920 --> 24:40.920]  Yeah.
[24:40.920 --> 24:45.080]  And think about too how we have this massive invasion at the southern border and we're
[24:45.080 --> 24:49.840]  justified in saying, well, we have to take these people in and look at the countries
[24:49.840 --> 24:50.840]  they came from.
[24:50.840 --> 24:52.400]  Well, what's wrong with the countries they came from?
[24:52.400 --> 24:53.400]  They're communists.
[24:53.400 --> 24:54.400]  Oh, that's the best part.
[24:54.400 --> 24:58.160]  The Wall Street Journal has Haitians swimming across the Rio Grande saying border patrol
[24:58.160 --> 25:01.320]  agents under investigation because the rain of a horse was hanging over.
[25:01.320 --> 25:02.320]  Yeah.
[25:02.320 --> 25:05.760]  Because they tried to stop people illegally coming across and then meanwhile, but oh,
[25:05.760 --> 25:07.840]  they're trying to swim into the white supremacist country.
[25:07.840 --> 25:08.840]  They're just bad.
[25:08.840 --> 25:10.840]  God, we want the races to get us.
[25:10.840 --> 25:11.840]  Oh, please.
[25:11.840 --> 25:12.840]  Oh.
[25:12.840 --> 25:13.840]  Yeah.
[25:13.840 --> 25:14.840]  Freaking bad, but everyone races to come to it.
[25:14.840 --> 25:19.800]  Oh, America races, but all the quote unquote minority groups that aren't even really minorities
[25:19.800 --> 25:21.280]  are racing to come here.
[25:21.280 --> 25:23.600]  And Alex, you know, the one thing about Justin Trudeau.
[25:23.600 --> 25:25.280]  Oh, stealing the election?
[25:25.280 --> 25:29.920]  But well, I mean, we can get into those results, but the one thing about Trudeau is he actually,
[25:29.920 --> 25:32.960]  he says the things that they're not supposed to say out loud.
[25:32.960 --> 25:33.960]  You ever noticed?
[25:33.960 --> 25:35.440]  He says, I want to be a dictator like G.C.
[25:35.440 --> 25:36.440]  Ping.
[25:36.440 --> 25:39.600]  And then somebody tells you a dictator, then they have the same mail in ballot stuff and
[25:39.600 --> 25:41.000]  it doesn't match the numbers.
[25:41.000 --> 25:42.800]  He's he barely still won.
[25:42.800 --> 25:43.800]  They have a parliament.
[25:43.800 --> 25:45.200]  So he's a lame duck.
[25:45.200 --> 25:49.880]  He doesn't have a majority government, so he said, he said yesterday, he said, we're
[25:49.880 --> 25:53.440]  going to treat the climate crisis just like we treated the COVID crisis, meaning you're
[25:53.440 --> 25:54.440]  going to be enslaved.
[25:54.440 --> 25:55.440]  Well, that's what they always said.
[25:55.440 --> 25:58.840]  They always said, this is going to segue from lockdowns for this to lockdowns that
[25:58.840 --> 26:01.320]  there's going to be a carbon app on your phone.
[26:01.320 --> 26:03.440]  And now they are just announcing all of it.
[26:03.440 --> 26:04.720]  They're just coming forward with all of it.
[26:04.720 --> 26:07.760]  And in Australia, things are getting violent, clashing between the police.
[26:07.760 --> 26:10.880]  Oh, my God, it's like Road Warrior, which is where the film is based.
[26:10.880 --> 26:11.880]  Did you know?
[26:11.880 --> 26:15.080]  But I mean, I've got all the articles right here, but what's wrong with what's wrong with
[26:15.080 --> 26:16.080]  eating trash?
[26:16.080 --> 26:18.800]  There's actually an article about how incredible it is.
[26:18.800 --> 26:25.480]  Oh, and let me ask, will you consume up cycled foods?
[26:25.480 --> 26:27.360]  I'm asking you.
[26:27.360 --> 26:28.360]  It says it's garbage.
[26:28.360 --> 26:29.880]  Do you want to eat garbage?
[26:29.880 --> 26:36.040]  No, no, I like steak, dinners and potatoes and fresh veggie.
[26:36.040 --> 26:41.200]  But notice they don't criticize like GMO food, they don't criticize McDonald's, they don't
[26:41.200 --> 26:43.760]  criticize stuff that is even food that's toxic for you.
[26:43.760 --> 26:47.400]  It's all about you need to have less calories for the earth and it needs to come from bug
[26:47.400 --> 26:48.400]  protein.
[26:48.400 --> 26:51.360]  We need you to eat bugs, not cows, bugs.
[26:51.360 --> 26:55.720]  And the irony too is, Alex, you know, for the most part, people have been eating trash
[26:55.720 --> 26:58.000]  for the last 30 years in America.
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.040]  I mean, it's well researched that people do throw away a lot of food and they shouldn't,
[27:01.040 --> 27:02.520]  but that doesn't mean we now eat bugs.
[27:02.520 --> 27:03.520]  See, and that's one thing.
[27:03.520 --> 27:07.520]  If you wanted to have a discuss about less, less, you know, waste of food and stuff, hey,
[27:07.520 --> 27:08.520]  we can have that discussion.
[27:08.520 --> 27:09.520]  That's not what this is.
[27:09.520 --> 27:11.080]  This is just totalitarian government.
[27:11.080 --> 27:12.520]  We have a poster on the wall.
[27:12.520 --> 27:14.120]  Totalitarianism dressing up as moral.
[27:14.120 --> 27:17.680]  We have a poster on the wall that says from World War Two that says food is a weapon,
[27:17.680 --> 27:18.680]  don't waste it.
[27:18.680 --> 27:21.840]  So people really shouldn't waste food and I'm saying myself included, you got some of
[27:21.840 --> 27:23.600]  the damn refrigerator, eat it.
[27:23.600 --> 27:24.600]  Okay.
[27:24.600 --> 27:28.120]  So that's just trying to be a better person and live by example.
[27:28.120 --> 27:31.600]  Notice the left pushes though takeout on everybody and the new economy is you're going to be
[27:31.600 --> 27:35.880]  a driver of the takeout when statistically it's not, it's the most unhealthy food.
[27:35.880 --> 27:37.080]  It exploits people that do it.
[27:37.080 --> 27:40.320]  You don't eat the food in your refrigerator and I'm not saying I don't order takeout
[27:40.320 --> 27:41.880]  sometimes, but I'm trying not to.
[27:41.880 --> 27:43.080]  It's much better to cook at home.
[27:43.080 --> 27:44.480]  It's a normal thing to cook.
[27:44.480 --> 27:46.760]  It's like farming or roofing or anything.
[27:46.760 --> 27:47.760]  It's fun to cook.
[27:47.760 --> 27:50.920]  You're meant to mess with your food, but people do not cook anymore.
[27:50.920 --> 27:51.920]  Yeah.
[27:51.920 --> 27:55.240]  So again though, you, you, the research has been done, whether it's McDonald's or other
[27:55.240 --> 27:59.840]  fast foods, but I think McDonald's is the one that's the most researched is that when
[27:59.840 --> 28:04.960]  you eat a steady diet of fast food, the gut bacteria just disappears.
[28:04.960 --> 28:06.480]  It just completely disappears.
[28:06.480 --> 28:09.480]  That's because McDonald's is, you know, it's been irradiated and everything.
[28:09.480 --> 28:14.280]  It doesn't die under a dish, but a regular hamburger is like rotting in three days.
[28:14.280 --> 28:16.160]  But under a dish, McDonald's doesn't die.
[28:16.160 --> 28:17.160]  It's eternal.
[28:17.160 --> 28:18.160]  It's like plastic.
[28:18.160 --> 28:20.440]  So they've really been, again, people want to have McDonald's burger.
[28:20.440 --> 28:22.960]  Okay, I'm not saying it's a, you know, have McDonald's burger if you want.
[28:22.960 --> 28:26.240]  I'm just saying we've already been eating trash.
[28:26.240 --> 28:29.040]  They've already been feeding us things that are unhealthy.
[28:29.040 --> 28:32.120]  Now they're just going public and making it standard.
[28:32.120 --> 28:35.840]  I'm not saying I won't eat a sonic chili cheese dog.
[28:35.840 --> 28:38.240]  He might as well take a shotgun to your column with that.
[28:38.240 --> 28:39.240]  But I mean, it's damn good.
[28:39.240 --> 28:42.240]  I mean, if I might sneak one in once a month, but yeah, you're not going to eat it every
[28:42.240 --> 28:43.240]  day.
[28:43.240 --> 28:45.440]  Well, I mean, I just know I'm abusing myself.
[28:45.440 --> 28:46.440]  Let's not tell lies here.
[28:46.440 --> 28:47.440]  But that's your right.
[28:47.440 --> 28:48.440]  That's your right.
[28:48.440 --> 28:49.440]  Absolutely.
[28:49.440 --> 28:50.440]  All right.
[28:50.440 --> 28:51.440]  We'll be right back.
[28:51.440 --> 28:52.440]  Stay with us.
[28:52.440 --> 28:53.440]  Hey, listen.
[28:53.440 --> 28:55.600]  Sonic coming up with your bug burger.
[28:55.600 --> 28:56.840]  They're not really folks.
[28:56.840 --> 28:57.840]  Upcycled.
[28:57.840 --> 28:58.840]  Hey, everybody.
[28:58.840 --> 29:01.960]  Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[29:01.960 --> 29:02.960]  Me too.
[29:02.960 --> 29:07.160]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[29:07.160 --> 29:09.880]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[29:09.880 --> 29:14.240]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[29:14.240 --> 29:15.960]  You probably already believe that.
[29:15.960 --> 29:17.160]  I certainly do.
[29:17.160 --> 29:18.160]  So here's the thing.
[29:18.160 --> 29:22.560]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually
[29:22.560 --> 29:26.640]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[29:26.640 --> 29:32.440]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.

[29:56.760 --> 30:04.440]  When Bob Woodward's new book came out, alleging that General Milley had called the head of
[30:04.440 --> 30:09.320]  the Chinese military and said, Trump might nuke you, he tried to overthrow the U.S. government,
[30:09.320 --> 30:13.160]  but basically I'm protecting you and I'll warn you if we launch an attack, which was
[30:13.160 --> 30:16.880]  the greatest reason in U.S. history that has ever been committed.
[30:16.880 --> 30:18.360]  He said, oh, Alex, it must not be true.
[30:18.360 --> 30:19.360]  I might wait.
[30:19.360 --> 30:23.040]  Bob Woodward's former naval intelligence, he's a big insider globalist, he wouldn't
[30:23.040 --> 30:27.360]  have put this out unless they wanted to put it out, say that Milley was a hero to set the
[30:27.360 --> 30:32.000]  precedent that you can have a permanent bureaucracy stay behind network deep state, basically
[30:32.000 --> 30:34.000]  that has its own bureaucratic coup over America.
[30:34.000 --> 30:38.560]  That's why he put bite in, he's so incredibly weak, he's to undermine the idea of the presidency.
[30:38.560 --> 30:41.520]  Well people said I was making it up with Bob Woodward's line.
[30:41.520 --> 30:42.960]  Well now Milley admits he did it.
[30:42.960 --> 30:45.000]  You see, I didn't need to trust Bob Woodward.
[30:45.000 --> 30:49.440]  I remember Pelosi on January 8th, bragging that she'd gotten a call from Milley that
[30:49.440 --> 30:51.080]  he'd taken control of the nukes.
[30:51.080 --> 30:54.040]  So this treason was hiding and playing to you back then and we covered it.
[30:54.040 --> 30:56.880]  See, I have a memory folks, I remember all this stuff.
[30:56.880 --> 30:58.840]  That's why I know it's true and what's false.
[30:58.840 --> 31:03.200]  We're already halfway through September, 2021.
[31:03.200 --> 31:04.200]  It's just incredible.
[31:04.200 --> 31:09.120]  And now the world is waking up that in full wars was the tip of the spear was dead on.

[31:58.680 --> 32:02.360]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[32:02.360 --> 32:06.560]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[32:06.560 --> 32:09.760]  But let me tell you, the new world order is breathing down our neck.
[32:09.760 --> 32:12.840]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they
[32:12.840 --> 32:14.160]  can to shut us down.
[32:14.160 --> 32:18.480]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air and please support the local station you're

[32:31.960 --> 32:34.080]  I need your help more than ever now.
[32:34.080 --> 32:38.400]  I want to keep fighting the globalist, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[32:38.400 --> 32:43.280]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast, however you can, and

[32:53.560 --> 32:54.560]  soul.
[32:54.560 --> 32:56.080]  All of it empowers humanity.
[32:56.080 --> 32:58.600]  All of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[32:58.600 --> 33:01.880]  Thank you so much.
[33:01.880 --> 33:17.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:17.480 --> 33:23.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:23.400 --> 33:28.360]  All right, thank you so much for tuning in to the heart of the resistance against the
[33:28.360 --> 33:34.800]  globalist takeovers, they mop up the final areas of free speech around the planet.
[33:34.800 --> 33:39.840]  We sit here and watch Congress refuse to take action.
[33:39.840 --> 33:41.920]  But do you know who did take action?
[33:41.920 --> 33:48.720]  I have right here in this weekend's Wall Street Journal, Xi Jinping has decided to basically
[33:48.720 --> 33:54.560]  kick out a lot of big tech corporations or demand that they take Chinese party members
[33:54.560 --> 33:58.680]  that are high level, even in the Politburo, onto their board of directors, which Apple
[33:58.680 --> 34:06.240]  and others have done, that give them the code keys to everybody's iPhones and Apple devices.
[34:06.240 --> 34:11.680]  That was actually, again, in the Wall Street Journal this weekend in a big article about
[34:11.680 --> 34:18.040]  Xi Jinping cracking down on capitalism and saying, we are communists, we're going to
[34:18.040 --> 34:23.720]  be communists, we're going to dominate the world with international communism, and about
[34:23.720 --> 34:29.280]  how he took down Jack Ma and Alibaba and all the rest of it, and he says, my final decision,
[34:29.280 --> 34:36.560]  he said this at a speech that they released a transcript of to the communists at a private
[34:36.560 --> 34:44.200]  hotel heavily guarded last year, was when they took in the winner, right off the election,
[34:44.200 --> 34:50.680]  Trump's Twitter away, and when they started censoring the US Senate, Xi Jinping said,
[34:50.680 --> 34:55.440]  our main enemy, we've already conquered basically the American government, our main enemy now
[34:55.440 --> 35:01.420]  is going to be big tech and the globalist, and so I actually had all these giant papers
[35:01.420 --> 35:04.880]  together here in my hands, and I was just looking during the break trying to find the
[35:04.880 --> 35:10.040]  Xi Jinping part, but I will, it was a huge long article, and I'm going to read some of
[35:10.040 --> 35:14.480]  that to you, but we already knew all this, but it was just crazy that they actually put
[35:14.480 --> 35:20.960]  it out in the official elite communist publication that in Chinese translate to English to in
[35:20.960 --> 35:25.920]  search of truth, and so I'm reading transcripts of in search of truth, and I went and looked
[35:25.920 --> 35:32.040]  it up myself and found it in Chinese English news, I didn't just believe this, and I looked
[35:32.040 --> 35:37.520]  it up on, you know, Wi-Fi, and sure enough, it was true, and so whenever we've had guests
[35:37.520 --> 35:43.640]  on that have said, Xi Jinping's becoming like Putin, this big person in opposition to globalism,
[35:43.640 --> 35:48.600]  it was happening, so that made me think of Justin Trudeau who the experts agree, and
[35:48.600 --> 35:52.640]  Trump's got the analysis and I agree with him, you saw massive election fraud in 2020,
[35:52.640 --> 35:56.720]  you saw it in California, almost every Republican that went to vote being told, oh sorry, somebody
[35:56.720 --> 36:04.560]  voted for the Democrat operative in your name, that clearly that's going on, but there's
[36:04.560 --> 36:10.920]  such a landslide against Trudeau that he still lost control of the parliament, because again
[36:10.920 --> 36:15.560]  it's a parliamentary system where it's like their Congress basically goes in the general
[36:15.560 --> 36:22.320]  election as well, so he is a lame duck, and that is now unfolded, because they've only
[36:22.320 --> 36:26.880]  got so many people off the voting rolls they've put back on, only so many people that died,
[36:26.880 --> 36:32.320]  only so many people that have moved to another province, just like in Florida and Texas,
[36:32.320 --> 36:38.000]  they had a reservoir of that in the 2020 election to be able to beat Trump, they were going
[36:38.000 --> 36:42.640]  to give Biden, Texas and Florida a claim, everything went blue, Democrats were saying
[36:42.640 --> 36:47.160]  that was happening, to create a psychological demoralization to make us believe the fraud,
[36:47.160 --> 36:51.400]  it would just be so big and overwhelming, but they ran out of the dead voters, the people
[36:51.400 --> 36:56.520]  that had moved out of state, and people that had stopped voting but were still on the rolls,
[36:56.520 --> 36:59.440]  that database, that was the big thing that came out of Michael and Dell's event that
[36:59.440 --> 37:03.600]  nobody gave attention, he had a real analyst on showing the real numbers, and then showing
[37:03.600 --> 37:09.520]  how people lived in other states or had died, and so the same thing happened in Canada is
[37:09.520 --> 37:13.760]  they just ran out of bullets, and the way they describe it is like a hill, where you've
[37:13.760 --> 37:18.840]  got to go basically 170 to get over the hill, but they only have so many votes, so much
[37:18.840 --> 37:24.880]  gas, you only get basically 100, and so in Texas and in Florida the answer is, total
[37:24.880 --> 37:30.120]  landslides can overwhelm fraud, because they only have so many votes they can put in on,
[37:30.120 --> 37:37.880]  so they've got big problems, and I also noticed a theme in the Washington Post that was, oh,
[37:37.880 --> 37:43.360]  Trump's crazy, the new religion was the headline of the Republican Party is election fraud,
[37:43.360 --> 37:48.840]  but they separately had articles about Baylor-Ruse being a fraud, they separately had fraud
[37:48.840 --> 37:53.920]  about all these other countries they don't like, and how their elections can't be trusted,
[37:53.920 --> 37:58.480]  and how their elections aren't transparent, and of course, obviously, they were showing
[37:58.480 --> 38:02.360]  a bunch of nations and different articles, oh, their election looks like a scam, and
[38:02.360 --> 38:06.040]  oh, this election isn't transparent, because it's people they don't like getting in, we're
[38:06.040 --> 38:10.440]  not just doing that here, Obama really won the election both times, people bought into
[38:10.440 --> 38:15.000]  his BS, but that's not what's happening with Joe Biden, and we all know it.
[38:15.000 --> 38:21.040]  Well, and remember, just a month ago, the Democrats were calling for an audit of the
[38:21.040 --> 38:26.920]  recall election, because they knew that Newsom was legitimately behind, at least on the straight-up
[38:26.920 --> 38:30.800]  recall vote, they know that there were probably more recall votes than not, so they were saying,
[38:30.800 --> 38:34.000]  oh, we need to audit this before it even happened, and then they got the result that
[38:34.000 --> 38:39.760]  they wanted, and it was like almost 10 million less votes than the 2020 presidential election
[38:39.760 --> 38:43.160]  in California, magically, and so then all of a sudden, they stopped wanting to call
[38:43.160 --> 38:47.760]  for audits, of course, we had the Russian interference and meddling narrative for two
[38:47.760 --> 38:52.560]  years, I guess that doesn't count anymore, either, but you asked me in the break, what
[38:52.560 --> 38:58.680]  is the biggest news story right now, Alex, and it's hard to really say, is it the inevitable
[38:58.680 --> 39:06.600]  fate of Australia, where physical violence seems to be in the near future of police versus
[39:06.600 --> 39:07.600]  citizens?
[39:07.600 --> 39:12.760]  Yesterday, we had a doctor on that explained to me why, I mean, this should be it, Alex,
[39:12.760 --> 39:18.280]  99% of COVID deaths happen in hospitals, why would that be?
[39:18.280 --> 39:20.240]  How does that not alarm people?
[39:20.240 --> 39:24.040]  It's because the way they treat you is what kills you, and that's been admitted, and that's
[39:24.040 --> 39:30.040]  what's crazy is that last year, it was totally made up, and the hospitals were killing everybody,
[39:30.040 --> 39:33.200]  this year, they've released something, most scientists believe it's coming out of the
[39:33.200 --> 39:37.080]  vaccine, even the FDA had hearing Saturday saying, we believe it came out of the vaccine,
[39:37.080 --> 39:42.280]  I don't know, I know that I checked, talked to hospitals, and I made calls around the
[39:42.280 --> 39:46.040]  country, four months ago, I was only hitting Texas and Florida, we were hit at the exact
[39:46.040 --> 39:49.800]  same time, going back a year and a half ago, a lot of experts I respect, like General
[39:49.800 --> 39:55.440]  Flynn believed it had been artificially released in only three areas around the world, and
[39:55.440 --> 40:00.040]  so that's not how these plagues work, it's not how new viruses work unless it's been
[40:00.040 --> 40:04.640]  artificially released, and then they would keep spreading, it didn't, and so now they're
[40:04.640 --> 40:09.960]  hitting the Midwest, now they're hitting Kansas and Missouri, now they're hitting Oklahoma,
[40:09.960 --> 40:15.240]  and now they're hitting, other conservatives just enclaves are being hit, and all the money
[40:15.240 --> 40:21.080]  is on, that this globalist consortium is releasing, and hell, I mean, they cooked up the stuff
[40:21.080 --> 40:25.000]  at Wuhan, they made the virus, they did gain the function, they stand to gain, they wore
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.160]  game to virus will be released, all the evidence points towards it's an ongoing bio attack,
[40:29.160 --> 40:32.200]  and I'm really concerned about what they're going to release next.
[40:32.200 --> 40:37.080]  And more and more is coming out about Fauci's involvement with the Chinese Communist military,
[40:37.080 --> 40:41.560]  funding at least 60 projects that we know of, some of the latest reports are insinuating
[40:41.560 --> 40:42.960]  it's over 200.
[40:42.960 --> 40:47.840]  Say that again though, as more documents come out, because we had hundreds last year, now
[40:47.840 --> 40:51.180]  it's hundreds and hundreds more this year, of him saying gain a function, he was the
[40:51.180 --> 40:57.000]  bad man directly with the Chinese military, so he's literally the equivalent of Hitler
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.920]  2.0, I mean this guy is the absolute enemy of humanity.
[41:00.920 --> 41:06.480]  Imagine though, we have a list, this isn't hearsay, this isn't conjecture, we have a
[41:06.480 --> 41:13.320]  list of politicians or government workers that we know have colluded with China.
[41:13.320 --> 41:19.360]  Joe Biden, General Milley, Anthony Fauci, Diane Feinstein, Eric Swalwell.
[41:19.360 --> 41:22.800]  By the way, let me just tell folks that they're a little bit, they're showing us from what
[41:22.800 --> 41:25.480]  we talked about a few minutes ago, this is Australia, people blocking the roads all over
[41:25.480 --> 41:26.880]  the country, keep going.
[41:26.880 --> 41:30.320]  And it's just descending into chaos there, but this is inevitable, and I'm afraid that
[41:30.320 --> 41:34.680]  the fate of Australia also goes the fate of the world, you know, they haven't been able
[41:34.680 --> 41:39.440]  to have the COVID tyranny in America as much as Australia, because we still have enough
[41:39.440 --> 41:44.360]  people here that live to be free, and business owners and politicians that don't want to
[41:44.360 --> 41:45.360]  do this.
[41:45.360 --> 41:48.520]  But they're slowly encroaching, and Biden announced today at the UN, he's surrendering
[41:48.520 --> 41:51.280]  the United States to the New World Order, that's why our border is open.
[41:51.280 --> 41:53.680]  You know, we should probably get that video for next hour.
[41:53.680 --> 41:56.960]  In fact, get to Biden from the UN, please, I forgot I meant to do that.
[41:56.960 --> 42:00.640]  They have it, we covered it this morning on the American Journal, so they should be able
[42:00.640 --> 42:02.840]  to pull that in quite easily.
[42:02.840 --> 42:07.200]  But it's eventually going to come here, Alex, and Biden even said, this is a decisive decade,
[42:07.200 --> 42:11.600]  the U.S. is surrendering to the will of the New World Order, and we have choices to make
[42:11.600 --> 42:13.400]  now to stop COVID and climate change.
[42:13.400 --> 42:16.920]  They're announcing, you're done, you're done, you as a free citizen.
[42:16.920 --> 42:21.960]  And let's announce, they're announcing every form of wealth, from cows, to chickens, to
[42:21.960 --> 42:22.960]  fish.
[42:22.960 --> 42:23.960]  Oh, they want to be in your bed.
[42:23.960 --> 42:27.360]  They're now announcing trees create carbon, so you can't grow those.
[42:27.360 --> 42:31.480]  Now the left says trees are bad, they want to dictate everything to you.
[42:31.480 --> 42:34.760]  You understand that, folks, that this is a post-industrial world, so we're going to
[42:34.760 --> 42:36.520]  look at Canada, what happened there.
[42:36.520 --> 42:39.680]  We're going to look at Biden's big speech to the UN, glad you reminded me of that.
[42:39.680 --> 42:45.200]  We've got Project Veritas James O'Keefe with that huge news coming out, but I want to talk
[42:45.200 --> 42:48.720]  to you about what do you think of all this news, the biggest story is, because they're
[42:48.720 --> 42:51.720]  all big, but they all like Russian dolls fit together.
[42:51.720 --> 42:56.360]  It's the New World Order, the borders collapsing, the forced inoculations, the global IDs,
[42:56.360 --> 42:58.360]  all of it is the same system.
[42:58.360 --> 43:08.240]  I'm 59 years old in good health, I'm not working in the front line, so my type is not recommended
[43:08.240 --> 43:10.240]  to get vaccinated.
[43:10.240 --> 43:16.440]  That was the current CEO of Pfizer, just a few months ago, on a national TV interview
[43:16.440 --> 43:24.640]  saying, oh, he doesn't need to take the so-called mRNA vaccine that's really a gene therapy.
[43:24.640 --> 43:27.920]  He said, you know, he's 57 years old, he's healthy, he doesn't need it.
[43:27.920 --> 43:33.000]  He said, risk people, but that's not what his PR firms that have bought off the politicians
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.080]  over 100 countries say, they say you've got to take it to have a job or leave your house
[43:37.080 --> 43:43.520]  or go on a plane or a train or even get outside your home for one hour a day to live in Australia.
[43:43.520 --> 43:48.600]  So remember, the White House is exempt, Congress and their staff are exempt, the Postal Service
[43:48.600 --> 43:53.440]  is exempt, all these big corporate heads are exempt, they're not taking their poison vaccine,
[43:53.440 --> 43:55.280]  they're pushing it on you.
[43:55.280 --> 43:57.480]  Wake up, folks, wake up.
[43:57.480 --> 44:04.240]  In late August, Info War saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[44:04.240 --> 44:10.640]  that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[44:10.640 --> 44:13.760]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[44:13.760 --> 44:16.760]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to
[44:16.760 --> 44:20.920]  have, it's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water
[44:20.920 --> 44:24.800]  filtration, self-defense and a relationship with God.
[44:24.800 --> 44:29.120]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in now, we're ready to
[44:29.120 --> 44:33.760]  ship to you within 24 hours of your order, it's high quality, it's very, very low cost

[44:39.160 --> 44:42.960]  and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[44:42.960 --> 44:49.240]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the Info War at infowarstore.com.
[44:49.240 --> 44:53.880]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[44:53.880 --> 44:58.680]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[44:58.680 --> 45:03.600]  I'll tell you what's life and death, if you don't have freedom of speech, if you don't
[45:03.600 --> 45:08.800]  have the right to communicate, then you don't have a future, all these governments take
[45:08.800 --> 45:12.440]  away speech, they then enslave the population and then they finally start exterminating
[45:12.440 --> 45:13.440]  the population.
[45:13.440 --> 45:18.000]  And America, the entire world is going down the tubes because the UN globalist directed
[45:18.000 --> 45:19.000]  great reset.
[45:19.000 --> 45:22.520]  That's why it's more important than ever that info war stay on the air and that all of us
[45:22.520 --> 45:23.520]  stay healthy.
[45:23.520 --> 45:28.840]  That's why I'm offering a bunch of our best-selling products in 50% off for a limited time only

[45:56.840 --> 45:57.840]  Take action.
[45:57.840 --> 45:58.840]  And I thank you.
[45:58.840 --> 46:03.000]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds.
[46:03.000 --> 46:04.000]  I was overweight.
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.040]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[46:06.040 --> 46:10.600]  I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[46:10.600 --> 46:14.000]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1.
[46:14.000 --> 46:15.160]  And it worked pretty good.
[46:15.160 --> 46:18.560]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that too, you know, with the deep burdens
[46:18.560 --> 46:20.560]  sourced, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[46:20.560 --> 46:26.440]  So I took it and then in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain
[46:26.440 --> 46:30.800]  was enlightened, you know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[46:30.800 --> 46:35.240]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously
[46:35.240 --> 46:37.360]  take basically all of your supplements.
[46:37.360 --> 46:39.280]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[46:39.280 --> 46:43.680]  The one I like recently is knock out literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[46:43.680 --> 46:44.680]  It's amazing.
[46:44.680 --> 46:45.680]  It works.
[46:45.680 --> 46:49.840]  The thing is, we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of the globalist system
[46:49.840 --> 46:53.640]  and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[46:53.640 --> 46:54.760]  Beautifully said, brother.
[46:54.760 --> 47:01.880]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[47:01.880 --> 47:21.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:21.280 --> 47:24.800]  I don't show you're here writing shotgun with me throughout the entire broadcast today.
[47:24.800 --> 47:25.800]  We're shaking stuff up.
[47:25.800 --> 47:26.800]  We like to do it.
[47:26.800 --> 47:32.560]  We hosted American Journal that Harrison Smith normally host 8 a.m. every weekday morning
[47:32.560 --> 47:36.760]  and then today Harrison's gonna be hosting the war room and I'm shaking up more than
[47:36.760 --> 47:37.760]  that.
[47:37.760 --> 47:41.760]  A couple of weeks I'm gonna host out of the old studio that I used to host out of, talk
[47:41.760 --> 47:44.160]  about nostalgia and then Owen's gonna host out of here.
[47:44.160 --> 47:48.680]  We're just gonna mix it up and then I'm gonna later I'm gonna host out of Harrison's studio.
[47:48.680 --> 47:53.120]  Everybody cross-trained on all the equipment and just to can shake it up for all the great
[47:53.120 --> 47:57.600]  TV viewers and listeners and radio listeners that are out there with this great crew that
[47:57.600 --> 47:59.600]  makes it all possible.
[47:59.600 --> 48:05.160]  Oh, and I knew what they would do if it's the same tactic every time when you had all
[48:05.160 --> 48:09.000]  these FDA boards, including the top board to come out Friday and Saturday and vote nearly
[48:09.000 --> 48:18.360]  unanimously in both boards, 16 to 2, 26 to 2, 26 to 1, that we shouldn't have boosters
[48:18.360 --> 48:23.040]  and you shouldn't inject under 16 and this drug is failing and it isn't protecting people
[48:23.040 --> 48:27.480]  and it's not a vaccine and it's down to 39% with a Pfizer shot and that's even with studies
[48:27.480 --> 48:32.480]  the drug company gives them, Moderna's down to 50-something percent and their answer is
[48:32.480 --> 48:34.040]  then just put out new fake studies.
[48:34.040 --> 48:37.880]  Oh, Pfizer says it's safe in children with all the leftists that brought their children
[48:37.880 --> 48:41.720]  in, little babies to be injected, I mean they really want our children even though even
[48:41.720 --> 48:45.160]  the so-called Delta variant doesn't really hurt children, gives them a sore throat, maybe
[48:45.160 --> 48:50.080]  their lungs hurt, there's so much stuff being put out, we know we're being lied to on every
[48:50.080 --> 48:56.120]  front, to me now, seeing it all just glazed over and Fauci spent it Saturday on seeing
[48:56.120 --> 49:00.480]  it and he goes, the clip was on InfoWars.com, I'm sure a lot of you saw it, it was all
[49:00.480 --> 49:03.880]  over the news, they played it everywhere, he's like, this shows the system works, we're
[49:03.880 --> 49:08.200]  not doing boosters right now, but we are going to give the children shots, he's been saying
[49:08.200 --> 49:12.840]  in October they're going to legalize it, they're going to authorize it through emergency with
[49:12.840 --> 49:17.960]  one-third the injection of the Pfizer, I mean they really want to do it because this evidence
[49:17.960 --> 49:21.840]  is showing, we know, it turns off the white blood cell killer T's, they don't know if
[49:21.840 --> 49:26.680]  it does it forever, you know Fauci's done all these other clandestine tests, they know,
[49:26.680 --> 49:30.480]  so again how do they think they're going to get away with this, with just new stories,
[49:30.480 --> 49:35.640]  new viruses, new scams, new fear, but to sit back and see them, not just go after their
[49:35.640 --> 49:39.640]  dumb constituents, who they want to kill, who they don't want to pay their pension
[49:39.640 --> 49:45.640]  funds to, but to see them now go after children, metaphysically to spiritual level, who don't
[49:45.640 --> 49:51.160]  have what you'd really call full free will yet, that's why you have the sexual consent
[49:51.160 --> 49:58.160]  age, it's 17 or 18, that's why you've got the liquor age at 21, things like nicotine
[49:58.160 --> 50:02.840]  at 21, gambling, because this is something, okay you're an adult, you can destroy your
[50:02.840 --> 50:06.760]  life if you want, but we don't do this to children, but everything about the left is
[50:06.760 --> 50:11.080]  oh and Europe and Canada and Australia and everywhere, oh we're going to give your five
[50:11.080 --> 50:15.240]  year old a shot even if you don't like it, they can make the decision, oh children in
[50:15.240 --> 50:19.520]  California, they're trying to pass a law, if they're gay, can have sex when they're
[50:19.520 --> 50:23.600]  12, and the same senator that legalized giving people HIV and hepatitis, he has that bill
[50:23.600 --> 50:27.960]  in her due, so they're making a run at our children and at free will and in our future,
[50:27.960 --> 50:29.480]  and it is truly satanic going.
[50:29.480 --> 50:33.480]  Well it's training the children at a young age that the concept of freedom doesn't even
[50:33.480 --> 50:38.200]  exist, so you shouldn't even have that notion, and then the sexualization of them is just
[50:38.200 --> 50:43.440]  a whole other level of it, but remember last week Fauci was on TV and he said, he was asked
[50:43.440 --> 50:46.840]  about natural immunity and he just says, oh I don't know about natural immunity, I haven't
[50:46.840 --> 50:47.840]  looked into that, what?
[50:47.840 --> 50:48.840]  What do you mean you haven't looked?
[50:48.840 --> 50:49.840]  What do you mean you don't know about that?
[50:49.840 --> 50:52.320]  That's like Pluto, I've never heard of that, what's that?
[50:52.320 --> 50:56.520]  I'm an astronaut, the moon, I don't know about the moon, what's that goofy thing, I've never
[50:56.520 --> 50:59.720]  heard of the moon, I'll look into the moon, I'm just an astronaut, I work for NASA, but
[50:59.720 --> 51:04.560]  I don't know about the moon, and so Johnson and Johnson also came out today and said
[51:04.560 --> 51:08.560]  that you need a booster every two months now, Alex every two months.
[51:08.560 --> 51:12.520]  And I told you that was coming because it was in the, a year and a half ago that's what
[51:12.520 --> 51:15.840]  Gates said, he goes, you're gonna get a shot every few months, you're like, how does Jones
[51:15.840 --> 51:17.080]  know this?
[51:17.080 --> 51:18.480]  Because they tell you.
[51:18.480 --> 51:22.320]  By the way, this was just something that was just kind of off the wall, I had the doctor
[51:22.320 --> 51:25.400]  on yesterday, there was such a powerful interview, it needs 10 million views, it needs 100 million
[51:25.400 --> 51:28.800]  views quite frankly with doctor artists, but he's gonna be back on with me on the war room
[51:28.800 --> 51:31.720]  next week, and I asked him a question all fair because I didn't want to sound like a
[51:31.720 --> 51:36.320]  complete moron asking this question, that's just one of those basic things that you don't
[51:36.320 --> 51:42.480]  think to ask, and I said, doc, why, you talk about any intravenous treatment or drug
[51:42.480 --> 51:45.120]  use, you go right into the vein, right?
[51:45.120 --> 51:47.400]  You find the vein, you go right into the vein.
[51:47.400 --> 51:51.720]  How come with vaccines, you just willy nilly stick to the arm and God knows what happens?
[51:51.720 --> 51:52.720]  And you know what he said?
[51:52.720 --> 51:53.720]  He said, I don't know.
[51:53.720 --> 51:56.240]  He said, I have no idea actually.
[51:56.240 --> 51:58.120]  So think about that.
[51:58.120 --> 51:59.120]  What is it?
[51:59.120 --> 52:01.120]  Where is the vaccine even going?
[52:01.120 --> 52:05.560]  What scientific purpose does this vaccine just going willy nilly into your arm?
[52:05.560 --> 52:09.680]  Well, they actually put the lipid on it, so it goes through the blood brain barrier where
[52:09.680 --> 52:10.680]  it's not supposed to go.
[52:10.680 --> 52:12.720]  I'm not going to do that directly, but let's just pull back.
[52:12.720 --> 52:16.480]  Let me show TV viewers this and I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[52:16.480 --> 52:20.600]  This is one page out of the Washington Post, E4, okay?
[52:20.600 --> 52:27.520]  It's the same page, and the whole paper is like this, will consumers find upcycled foods
[52:27.520 --> 52:30.280]  appetizing garbage?
[52:30.280 --> 52:32.280]  They're going to make school kids eat it.
[52:32.280 --> 52:36.080]  Another article, to fight climate change, scientists potty train cows because they're
[52:36.080 --> 52:40.680]  saying their methane, their gas is toxic even though they've been bovine all over the surface
[52:40.680 --> 52:45.840]  of the planet forever from Africa to the Americas to Asia to everywhere, and they estimate actually
[52:45.840 --> 52:48.800]  higher numbers in many areas of cows that are out now.
[52:48.800 --> 52:49.800]  These are just domesticated.
[52:49.800 --> 52:54.760]  It's like a pig turns into a wild boar after about a year, grows long hair, tusk when it
[52:54.760 --> 52:57.240]  gets outside the pen.
[52:57.240 --> 53:01.800]  So cows go wild once they've lived outside as well, and then you haven't been domesticated.
[53:01.800 --> 53:07.880]  So again, all women must have cesareans, all of us must be given a gene therapy that gets
[53:07.880 --> 53:08.880]  rid of our immune system.
[53:08.880 --> 53:12.000]  We've got to have all these new things every few months for whatever's out there because
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.080]  they've erased our immune system, and then it gives you basically barracks, disease in
[53:15.080 --> 53:17.440]  humans and creates superviruses.
[53:17.440 --> 53:19.280]  That's the mainline science.
[53:19.280 --> 53:23.840]  So that's where all this is going, and now they're sticking tubes in the rear ends of
[53:23.840 --> 53:29.200]  cows and they wear a big giant bag on their back in Canada and Germany and torture them.
[53:29.200 --> 53:30.680]  And the animal right here will love it.
[53:30.680 --> 53:33.640]  It's stopping their farts, folks.
[53:33.640 --> 53:39.880]  There've always been creatures on this planet, plankton, past gas, fish past gas, turkeys
[53:39.880 --> 53:41.880]  past gas, elephants do it.
[53:41.880 --> 53:43.520]  It's our damn atmosphere.
[53:43.520 --> 53:48.040]  But they're telling you that gas from cows is bad because it's a giant industry they
[53:48.040 --> 53:50.960]  want to target and take over and restrict, okay?
[53:50.960 --> 53:54.640]  And they're telling you, you'll get like, you know, one piece of meat a year officially.
[53:54.640 --> 53:58.720]  So just when I show you this, they're making life artificial.
[53:58.720 --> 54:00.680]  They don't want babies getting mother's milk.
[54:00.680 --> 54:02.800]  They don't want women having children vaginally.
[54:02.800 --> 54:05.280]  They don't, they don't want children to learn their own immune system.
[54:05.280 --> 54:10.320]  They want pod people and pod cows, and they want to shove giant hoses up the rear ends
[54:10.320 --> 54:11.320]  of cows.
[54:11.320 --> 54:14.880]  By the way, you can type in cows now wearing fart bags as the headline.
[54:14.880 --> 54:21.080]  I mean, they have thousands of cows in Canada and they torture with bags hooked up to them.
[54:21.080 --> 54:22.480]  So this isn't a joke, okay?
[54:22.480 --> 54:24.400]  Yeah, there's a fart bag on a cow.
[54:24.400 --> 54:25.400]  And by the way.
[54:25.400 --> 54:26.400]  So this is not a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[54:26.400 --> 54:29.120]  This is scientists trying to put us all in cages.
[54:29.120 --> 54:30.120]  All the...
[54:30.120 --> 54:31.120]  They want to make us all abrats.
[54:31.120 --> 54:36.720]  All the research that has been done into having a soy diet, it's just all negative.
[54:36.720 --> 54:37.720]  It's all negative.
[54:37.720 --> 54:42.360]  In fact, there was one study that I was following on this website, Herculean Strength, that's
[54:42.360 --> 54:46.320]  just into, you know, fitness and, you know, lifting weights and stuff.
[54:46.320 --> 54:50.640]  And there was a guy who was on a soy-based diet for three months, had all kinds of failures
[54:50.640 --> 54:51.800]  in his organs.
[54:51.800 --> 54:54.960]  He developed breast tissue, I mean, just totally unhealthy.
[54:54.960 --> 54:58.480]  That's why they feed you an all-soy diet, basically at prisons, because it takes men
[54:58.480 --> 54:59.480]  and destroys them.
[54:59.480 --> 55:00.480]  And let's expand it.
[55:00.480 --> 55:01.480]  We'll expand on that next hour.
[55:01.480 --> 55:02.480]  Well, and then...
[55:02.480 --> 55:05.000]  So what happened was he quit doing it after the three months of experiment.
[55:05.000 --> 55:08.440]  He went back on a normal diet and basically was able to just get back into health just
[55:08.440 --> 55:10.040]  back on a normal diet for three months.
[55:10.040 --> 55:13.400]  And so is in potato chips and everything, but let's be clear.
[55:13.400 --> 55:17.760]  It was Henry Ford that popularized the soybean for humans.
[55:17.760 --> 55:21.840]  And if you process soybeans right, it has a very low level of estrogen, but they're processing
[55:21.840 --> 55:25.360]  basically whole soybeans that you might as well just cut your testicles off.
[55:25.360 --> 55:28.360]  And women, you might as well just get breast cancer because it makes you grow breast cancer.
[55:28.360 --> 55:29.360]  That's in the studies.
[55:29.360 --> 55:30.360]  We're going to go to break.
[55:30.360 --> 55:34.320]  We've got Project Veritas with their bombshell news coming up next hour.
[55:34.320 --> 55:36.080]  Owen and I are going to cover the waterfront.
[55:36.080 --> 55:37.080]  We've got so many clips.
[55:37.080 --> 55:42.000]  We've got Biden at the UN just announcing more world government that sell out of U.S. sovereignty
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.640]  and how we pledge to inject the whole planet.
[55:44.640 --> 55:45.640]  That is next hour.
[55:45.640 --> 55:50.320]  But please, understand, we're only able to be on air because of you and I want to thank
[55:50.320 --> 55:51.960]  you all for your support.

[56:26.040 --> 56:27.920]  So many people are deficient in iodine.

[56:31.160 --> 56:35.240]  of the 70s, put it in the salt, and it made IQs in the U.S. go up 15 points on average
[56:35.240 --> 56:39.080]  within the first 20 years of putting it in in the 1930s.
[56:39.080 --> 56:40.440]  A lot of deformities went down.

[56:59.400 --> 57:02.200]  going to have more that comes in for months separately.
[57:02.200 --> 57:06.320]  All apparel is at cost, and I didn't know they hadn't added the baseball caps and stuff.
[57:06.320 --> 57:08.120]  So now it is all the apparel.
[57:08.120 --> 57:09.120]  Is that cost?
[57:09.120 --> 57:13.360]  That means the lowest shirts are $9.95, the most expensive are $14.95 because some of
[57:13.360 --> 57:15.560]  the stuff costs us like $18.
[57:15.560 --> 57:21.560]  Some of the shirts cost us $5, so they average it together for the lower cost items are $9.95
[57:21.560 --> 57:26.000]  and the higher cost items are $14.95, so it averages together at cost, infowarstore.com,

[57:53.040 --> 57:57.680]  And now the world is waking up that info wars was the tip of the spear and was dead on.

[58:44.440 --> 58:50.480]  from the bottom of my heart, plus these are great products, please take action.
[58:50.480 --> 58:53.240]  General Lee, it's General Milley.
[58:53.240 --> 58:56.960]  I just want you to know that Trump tried to overthrow the US government two days ago
[58:56.960 --> 59:01.600]  on January 6th and I just want you to know I've taken control of the nuclear weapons
[59:01.600 --> 59:06.960]  and if Trump tries to launch an attack on you, we'll let you know first the attacks coming.
[59:06.960 --> 59:12.680]  That is from the transcript, then he called Pelosi, Schumer and others to say, I'm loyal
[59:12.680 --> 59:16.600]  to you, I'm going to protect Trump from using nuclear weapons, when Trump was going for
[59:16.600 --> 59:20.160]  detente with China and North Korea at the time and Trump's responded saying it's a
[59:20.160 --> 59:21.160]  total lie.
[59:21.160 --> 59:24.960]  Pelosi's come out and admitted it happened, hell she bragged back on January 8th that
[59:24.960 --> 59:29.880]  it took place then and is saying that she honors Milley and that he's this courageous
[59:29.880 --> 59:32.080]  person so we're all these other Democrats.
[59:32.080 --> 59:36.320]  So this is the permanent deep state coup that's been in control for a long time now coming
[59:36.320 --> 59:37.880]  out of the shadows publicly.
[59:37.880 --> 59:42.000]  Remember, these people literally hate you and your family, now they're injecting you
[59:42.000 --> 59:45.240]  with poison soft kill injections.
[59:45.240 --> 59:51.800]  Wake up America or be destroyed.
[59:51.800 --> 1:00:09.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:09.400 --> 1:00:14.040]  I am extremely shocked by what's happening at the Texas border, I mean I knew that they
[1:00:14.040 --> 1:00:19.840]  were breaking the border, I knew that they hired the same man who worked for the EU and
[1:00:19.840 --> 1:00:25.800]  George Soros who got hired ten years ago to break Europe's border and set up the NGOs
[1:00:25.800 --> 1:00:31.080]  that bring people in by land and also by sea on the Zodiac boats but also pay them to fly
[1:00:31.080 --> 1:00:36.400]  in to European countries and never leave, they are the clients of the non-governmental
[1:00:36.400 --> 1:00:37.760]  organizations of the UN.
[1:00:37.760 --> 1:00:42.600]  The longer a refugee is in a new country, the more likely it is that they'll put down
[1:00:42.600 --> 1:00:57.800]  roots and the more likely it is that they will stay.
[1:00:57.800 --> 1:01:02.040]  You have to have an open society, you have to mediate the tension between equality and
[1:01:02.040 --> 1:01:06.840]  liberty, popular sovereignty and individual freedom and it's a difficult task.
[1:01:06.840 --> 1:01:14.680]  I remember seeing Biden back in March of last year, I mean a full six months before the election
[1:01:14.680 --> 1:01:20.640]  saying that if I get elected immediately surge the border and come take over the United States.
[1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:25.480]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[1:01:25.480 --> 1:01:30.040]  Well look I guess I should be flattered, people are coming because I'm the nice guy, that's
[1:01:30.040 --> 1:01:34.320]  the reason why it's happening, that I'm a decent man who I have a phrase that you know
[1:01:34.320 --> 1:01:35.920]  that's why they're coming.
[1:01:35.920 --> 1:01:42.200]  And those who come seeking asylum, we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them,
[1:01:42.200 --> 1:01:44.520]  keep them safe until they can be heard.
[1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:50.840]  Well they came wearing Biden outfits, they came wearing Biden campaign clothing, shirts
[1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:52.800]  and jackets and ball caps.
[1:01:52.800 --> 1:01:58.440]  Reports have indicated at least 108 COVID positive illegal aliens were released by CVP in one
[1:01:58.440 --> 1:01:59.440]  fell swoop.
[1:01:59.440 --> 1:02:04.080]  According to reports at least 185 immigrants released in the past month in Brownsville
[1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:10.280]  tested positive, 25 Border Patrol agents have died of COVID.
[1:02:10.280 --> 1:02:13.680]  But the administration has taken no major steps to prioritize those front line workers
[1:02:13.680 --> 1:02:15.560]  for the vaccine in the last two months.
[1:02:15.560 --> 1:02:18.440]  Most of them are having to go into the communities to go get the vaccine even though they're
[1:02:18.440 --> 1:02:23.320]  on the front lines dealing with COVID positive individuals coming across our border.
[1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:27.080]  Where's the Vice President on any of this, isn't she supposed to be addressing the root
[1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:29.120]  causes of migration?
[1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:33.000]  Absolutely and she has been addressing the root causes of migration by working with countries
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:37.440]  in the region to ensure they have the assistance they need to reduce the number of people who
[1:02:37.440 --> 1:02:40.200]  are coming and trying to make those journeys across the border.
[1:02:40.200 --> 1:02:43.000]  We've actually seen some reductions in some of those numbers.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:47.280]  That doesn't change the fact that this is a very challenging situation in Del Rio.
[1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:51.600]  We're working to implement our policies and we're working to ensure we are also addressing
[1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:52.600]  the root causes.
[1:02:52.600 --> 1:02:57.680]  They don't look like for example Christians fleeing persecution from Nigeria who are actually
[1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:02.040]  in the midst of a genocide who cannot even get asylum in this country.
[1:03:02.040 --> 1:03:05.200]  But the asylum laws are actually written for them.
[1:03:05.200 --> 1:03:08.540]  And what you're seeing happen here is when all those thousands of people in the bridge
[1:03:08.540 --> 1:03:13.400]  try to, you know what the agents tell me, they've got like 24 Port-a-Jones for those
[1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:14.400]  people.
[1:03:14.400 --> 1:03:18.120]  Several hundred of them, like around 300, escaped on Sunday morning.
[1:03:18.120 --> 1:03:19.440]  They just ran away.
[1:03:19.440 --> 1:03:21.040]  The conditions are miserable.
[1:03:21.040 --> 1:03:22.240]  They don't have enough food.
[1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:25.560]  They don't have any real facilities or security.
[1:03:25.560 --> 1:03:28.640]  It is an absolute unmitigated disaster.
[1:03:28.640 --> 1:03:33.080]  And what you're seeing happen here is all those people in the Biden administration that
[1:03:33.080 --> 1:03:37.440]  came from the Open Society Foundation that we're not allowed to talk about because that
[1:03:37.440 --> 1:03:38.800]  will be the end of us, right?
[1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:40.120]  They'll come for all of us.
[1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:41.440]  Well, you know what?
[1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:44.440]  Those people, those advisors, they don't want a border.
[1:03:44.440 --> 1:03:46.800]  What does open society mean?
[1:03:46.800 --> 1:03:49.920]  It means no borders, which means no America, right?
[1:03:49.920 --> 1:03:50.920]  No countries.
[1:03:50.920 --> 1:03:56.880]  That's why patriotism and the flag and all of those things are so evil today, right?
[1:03:56.880 --> 1:03:59.840]  They're automatically white supremacy and nationalism.
[1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:05.000]  Never mind that you can be, you know, an African country and be proud of your flag and your
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.960]  borders, or you can come from Kosovo or wherever.
[1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:11.240]  So what you're seeing is part of a much bigger political picture.
[1:04:11.240 --> 1:04:13.240]  It's not just about the border.
[1:04:13.240 --> 1:04:19.920]  It was tenfold the Border Patrol said any previous record surge they saw under Biden.
[1:04:19.920 --> 1:04:23.080]  Then three months ago, we had an exclusive interview with a Border Patrol agent and we
[1:04:23.080 --> 1:04:29.600]  blurred out his face, his identity, and he talked about how they are told to turn back
[1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:36.480]  nobody basically, but then lie and falsify and claim that eight out of ten were turnbacks.
[1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:44.320]  So he said they'd already had as of then over a million people that they knew had come in
[1:04:44.320 --> 1:04:48.360]  and up to three million to four million more that had gotten through and that by the end
[1:04:48.360 --> 1:04:54.600]  of fiscal year, they were estimating eight to ten million just in the Texas border sector.
[48:31.300 --> 1:05:27.520]  that's why I'm offering a bunch of our best selling products and 50% off

[1:05:57.840 --> 1:05:58.840]  I thank you.
[1:05:58.840 --> 1:06:08.840]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:08.840 --> 1:06:19.840]  Well, I really like Laura Logan.
[1:06:19.840 --> 1:06:20.840]  I've always liked her.
[1:06:20.840 --> 1:06:22.560]  She's a real investigative journalist.
[1:06:22.560 --> 1:06:27.960]  She got raped by like 20 plus Egyptians took her a long time to get over that during the
[1:06:27.960 --> 1:06:33.800]  Arab Spring that Tucker Carlson, you know, was exposing at the time, but the CNN and
[1:06:33.800 --> 1:06:39.800]  other channels were pushing as a good thing, people like, of course, their big star over
[1:06:39.800 --> 1:06:44.280]  there, Anderson Cooper, that was all part of Obama destabilizing the world being behind
[1:06:44.280 --> 1:06:45.280]  radical Islam.
[1:06:45.280 --> 1:06:49.200]  That's why the collapse of Afghanistan, the bad pull out violating Trump's plan was
[1:06:49.200 --> 1:06:52.720]  executed as well because they want to empower these groups to invade Europe, just like they're
[1:06:52.720 --> 1:07:00.000]  empowering groups to invade the United States, but wow, she was on last night with Tucker
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:06.720]  Carlson and they crossed that invisible line that you're not supposed to cross.
[1:07:06.720 --> 1:07:15.600]  Remember Lou Dobbs had two years ago now, he had judicial watches head on and he was
[1:07:15.600 --> 1:07:19.480]  covering the fact that the open society gets State Department money, the Trump had just
[1:07:19.480 --> 1:07:25.080]  killed that money and that's given to George Soros to then invade with UN NGOs that set
[1:07:25.080 --> 1:07:31.320]  up these refugee camps in Guatemala and in other areas on the border of Europe, which
[1:07:31.320 --> 1:07:32.320]  is all a fact.
[1:07:32.320 --> 1:07:37.440]  I mean, separately, George Soros is in Newsweek and Reuters bragging how he does it, but you're
[1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:41.000]  not supposed to criticize it and say cut the funding, which Trump had just done.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  They said you could never have that particular person on from judicial watch and they threatened
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:52.320]  to fire Dobbs who did it again, well, last night, and it's in a report that John Bown
[1:07:52.320 --> 1:07:57.160]  filed on the subject today at Band.Video, it actually happened.
[1:07:57.160 --> 1:08:04.840]  So that shows you, Tucker Carlson is the only person that is at Fox News that actually has
[1:08:04.840 --> 1:08:05.840]  his free speech.
[1:08:05.840 --> 1:08:09.840]  I can tell you that and I'll leave it at that, but the article in the video is called
[1:08:09.840 --> 1:08:17.000]  Invasion by NGOs to the John Bown section of Band.Video, I hope you will share that
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:24.760]  in information, I was on Tim Poole's great podcast last night out of his farmhouse compound
[1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:28.080]  and they were trying to tweet out Band.Video and they wouldn't let them and I said, no,
[1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:34.000]  you got to tweet out freeworldnews.tv and they did that, but that's why we have freeworldnews.tv,
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:36.840]  it's the same as Band.Video, it's the same size, the same links, the same videos, it
[1:08:36.840 --> 1:08:40.760]  just gets you around that and I'm sure they'll ban that up for six months and they haven't
[1:08:40.760 --> 1:08:46.040]  banned that URL yet, number 79 days of news and all those other names we had that they
[1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:49.720]  did then ban, but we can just create a new one as soon as they do that, but it's good
[1:08:49.720 --> 1:08:55.720]  for now, freeworldnews.tv, but think as Americans, we've got to fight to get out transmissions
[1:08:55.720 --> 1:08:59.120]  and fight to show you what's happened at the border with our crew that went down there
[1:08:59.120 --> 1:09:03.360]  last week, did a great job and broke a lot of this news first, but then the Taliban,
[1:09:03.360 --> 1:09:06.800]  they've got their Twitter and I say, as long as they don't call for violence, courted attacks
[1:09:06.800 --> 1:09:11.600]  on Twitter, that's their issue, but I mean, I say we should have free speech for everybody,
[1:09:11.600 --> 1:09:15.600]  but we don't get the free speech on what shows because we're the bad guys, we're the dirty
[1:09:15.600 --> 1:09:20.200]  Americans and that's why Sarah Silverman and people say they get sick at their stomach,
[1:09:20.200 --> 1:09:24.520]  they get scared when they see American flags. Well, then what ideology does she follow?
[1:09:24.520 --> 1:09:28.800]  Well, corporate globalism, the same Apple owned type system that runs the worst slave
[1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:34.280]  camps in the world with suicide nets. And the other day, Sarah Silverman called for
[1:09:34.280 --> 1:09:40.160]  a, what has been dubbed a national divorce on her podcast. Yeah, there's the clip right
[1:09:40.160 --> 1:09:44.560]  there saying, look, you know, Americans don't get along. And so Alex, this is not what,
[1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:48.640]  I mean, this was never anything that I ever wanted to see happen, a national divorce or
[1:09:48.640 --> 1:09:49.640]  whatever you want to call it.
[1:09:49.640 --> 1:09:53.560]  That's what Black Lives Matter was a racial divide. Now the vaccine is about the ignorant
[1:09:53.560 --> 1:09:58.240]  and her germaphobe divide. And this is divided in Congress in the country. That's what they're
[1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:03.000]  trying. And so, but now you look at a situation and you say, if it's inevitable, as Biden
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:08.160]  announced today, that the US is going to surrender to the new world order and to the UN, well,
[1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:13.040]  then do Republican states or do certain states of the union even have a choice if they want
[1:10:13.040 --> 1:10:18.400]  to have a sovereign living situation at all? I mean, what do you do? I mean, you can go,
[1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:22.000]  I remember history class, you'd study maps in civil war and you'd have the free states
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:25.120]  and the slave states. I mean, is that what we're coming back to? Do we have to have a
[1:10:25.120 --> 1:10:29.400]  map of America where you have free states and you have slave states?
[1:10:29.400 --> 1:10:34.480]  Well, a lot of people that live in the country are self sufficient from, you know, West Virginia
[1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:39.920]  to Texas to Idaho to Montana to Wyoming are saying, well, we'll just, we'll just have
[1:10:39.920 --> 1:10:42.960]  our own food or our own community. They're going to cut the fuel off. They're going to
[1:10:42.960 --> 1:10:47.320]  cut the electricity off down the road and they are going to bring us under feudalism.
[1:10:47.320 --> 1:10:52.320]  We have to defeat them. We can't go along with this idea they're pushing because they
[1:10:52.320 --> 1:10:57.840]  control the big central banks that are going to break this, this country up. So speaking
[1:10:57.840 --> 1:11:03.000]  to that, here's Sarah Silverman saying that she gets really upset in a, in a, in a piece
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:06.280]  she was doing that so-called comedy. It's totally boring. People all get incredibly
[1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:10.000]  low ratings, by the way, you know, in not just in the viewers, but also people rated.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:13.680]  It gets like half a star, but they still just proper up. And then they have the clip of
[1:11:13.680 --> 1:11:17.280]  her on the podcast again saying, let's have a national divorce. Well, listen, you already
[1:11:17.280 --> 1:11:21.520]  had your divorce. You work for the globalist. You're a parasite. You work for Hollywood.
[1:11:21.520 --> 1:11:25.640]  It's parasitic. And so you're trying to say you want a divorce from us. That's reverse
[1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:29.560]  psychology. They want to stay glommed on us, running our lives, being our children wear
[1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:34.600]  a mask and then ejecting deadly poison in them. She's part of a cult. Here she is.
[1:11:34.600 --> 1:11:39.800]  I had a boyfriend many years ago. He was my first boyfriend who had his own house. And
[1:11:39.800 --> 1:11:44.880]  one day I went outside to see what he was doing and he was hoisting an American flag
[1:11:44.880 --> 1:11:51.960]  up the flagpole in his front yard. And I instantly felt very weird. It didn't make sense, but
[1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:59.160]  I felt this feeling of like, I felt scared. Yeah, I felt scared. And so I was like, what
[1:11:59.160 --> 1:12:06.720]  are you doing? And he said, raising the flag. And I was like, why? And he's like, um, because
[1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:16.520]  I love America. And I was like, right, right, of course. But inside I was shaken. And then
[1:12:16.520 --> 1:12:21.000]  I calmly walked to my car and I got inside and I called my sister Susie to tell her
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:25.440]  what happened. Now maybe you're thinking, what do you mean what happened? Nothing happened.
[1:12:25.440 --> 1:12:30.120]  Her boyfriend put an American flag up at his own house. No, you're totally right. I had
[1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:36.680]  no idea why I was freaking out. I just, I had this very visceral reaction. And my sister,
[1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:42.720]  who knows because she's a rabbi in Israel, explained to me, she was like, dude, nationalism
[1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:49.000]  is innately terrifying for Jews. Think about it. Flags marching blind allegiance. These
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  things tend to ring a bell for us. Right. Of course. Duh. It made sense. So that makes
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:01.240]  no sense. And then she's the one that dresses up like Hitler. Get attention on TV. So let's
[1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:07.320]  let's expand on this. America saved the Jews. So now you what she's saying is America is
[1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:12.320]  the Nazi. The left says the flag is racist. The National Archives puts a trigger warning
[1:13:12.320 --> 1:13:15.720]  on the Bill of Rights and Constitution because she's an authoritarian represents people that
[1:13:15.720 --> 1:13:19.680]  run shiny slave camps, big corporations that wrap themselves in black lives matter. And
[1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:24.720]  her talking point is to introduce that, oh, I hate America. It's dirty. It's bad. And
[1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:28.880]  then my sister, who's a rabbi, she explained to me, you're right because, you know, you're
[1:13:28.880 --> 1:13:33.520]  a poor victim of America. This is out of control. But, but again, this is the talking point
[1:13:33.520 --> 1:13:37.320]  she's been given because the globalists are getting rid of this country folks. How does
[1:13:37.320 --> 1:13:43.480]  she say that? I'm just at a loss here. Israel is one of the most nationalistic countries
[1:13:43.480 --> 1:13:49.120]  on the planet. Well, the truth is, if this is where your libertarians don't get it, if
[1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:54.000]  you don't have a defense system and your own culture and your own ideas, you will be conquered
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:58.160]  because the other groups are always bad groups out there. And so she's saying you shouldn't
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:01.720]  have a nation. You shouldn't have an identity. You shouldn't be proud of the American because
[1:14:01.720 --> 1:14:06.160]  she's part of the globalist corporate sellout that wants to tell us to have no identity.
[1:14:06.160 --> 1:14:11.360]  So we just roll over to them. It's very elementary. She's a globalist. She has her talking points
[1:14:11.360 --> 1:14:16.920]  and she's up there to tell you America equals Hitler. If that story is even true that she's
[1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:23.440]  talking about, this is the same woman who is such a basket case that she saw painting
[1:14:23.440 --> 1:14:27.320]  on the street that marks plumbing or electrical wire. You have to have it done whenever you're
[1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:30.840]  going to do work in your yard or out on the street. She saw painting on the street and
[1:14:30.840 --> 1:14:35.760]  said, Oh my gosh, look, it's a Nazi swastika. And it was literally just a marking for pipes
[1:14:35.760 --> 1:14:39.840]  under the street. And this woman says she's triggered by the. Well, let's explain. She
[1:14:39.840 --> 1:14:44.760]  knows that's not true. So does AOC when they do this, they want to, she said cauliflower
[1:14:44.760 --> 1:14:49.280]  is bad because it's white AOC did that is to manipulate their lowbrow supporters to
[1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:55.280]  willing it scared. And so, and so Bubba Wallace sees the loop that everybody has. If they're
[1:14:55.280 --> 1:15:00.680]  smart, you tie one on your garage. So you pull it down because it wasn't electric garage.
[1:15:00.680 --> 1:15:06.080]  And he goes, I saw that you know, I saw these, these, these nuisances, but that's because
[1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:10.480]  this is the new culture and the new system of the corporations turn us against each other.
[1:15:10.480 --> 1:15:14.160]  While they spy on us, while they lock us down, they put deadly poison in all of us, while
[1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:17.480]  they open our borders, while they tell us we're not essential, while they do all this
[1:15:17.480 --> 1:15:21.000]  does, then they run around saying, did you see the cloud? There was a swastika in the
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:26.080]  cloud. It's, it's complete lunacy. It's cloud world. It's, it's a mental illness is what
[1:15:26.080 --> 1:15:30.560]  it is. And I see all these videos. They're young kids. I covered one where they're saying,
[1:15:30.560 --> 1:15:34.440]  I don't understand. You know, I'm walking around. I'm triggered by everything. I'm always nervous.
[1:15:34.440 --> 1:15:38.880]  I'm always afraid. That's what the left has done to you. That's what they've done to
[1:15:38.880 --> 1:15:43.680]  you six to nine times. Basket case, six to time, six to nine times. We're likely to commit
[1:15:43.680 --> 1:15:47.560]  suicide or the mental institution left. But let's come back. That was silverman a while
[1:15:47.560 --> 1:15:51.520]  back ago saying, Oh, I just heard hating America. It's healthy. Now I think about it and said,

[1:18:55.040 --> 1:19:01.280]  your heart to continue to support him for the worse. God bless. Globalist General Milley has
[1:19:01.280 --> 1:19:06.560]  revealed to the world that the United States is not a free republic but is run by a permanent
[1:19:06.560 --> 1:19:13.040]  state-bound network, bureaucracy. The big takeaway here is that he didn't act alone. He felt that he
[1:19:13.040 --> 1:19:19.040]  was safe to talk on an overseas phone line system that he knew was being watched by not just our
[1:19:19.040 --> 1:19:23.520]  government but the Five Eyes, the Russians and the Chinese. He wanted the world to know that
[1:19:23.520 --> 1:19:28.880]  he was proud of what he was doing because he was backed by the deep state. This permanent bureaucracy
[1:19:28.880 --> 1:19:34.560]  sees America as its enemy. It sees the American people as its enemy. It sees prosperity as its
[1:19:34.560 --> 1:19:40.000]  enemy and it conspired with the Communist Chinese to threaten them basically and say Trump may nuke
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:45.440]  you but if he tries we'll call and say we're attacking you so you can respond first. That's
[1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:51.040]  beyond treason but it shows the type of anti-American sycophants living in their own vetted bubble
[1:19:51.040 --> 1:19:56.000]  they try to get away with this. Milley and all of his accomplices seem to go to prison now for life.
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:20:03.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:23.440]  Welcome back. You know I'm sick of looking at Sarah Silverman, that little anti-American
[1:20:23.440 --> 1:20:30.160]  globalist rat, Chycom dropping. We're not going to play the clip of her. Everybody knows she's
[1:20:30.160 --> 1:20:35.360]  said it. How about we play Biden calling for a new world order and then defining it as China
[1:20:35.360 --> 1:20:40.640]  owning and dominating us as Milley has said to our troops that America's going to go down and
[1:20:40.640 --> 1:20:45.040]  China's going to go up and that's the way it is. He also says white people attack the capital because
[1:20:45.040 --> 1:20:50.320]  they're inherently racist. Total globalists divide the country, take the country down crap
[1:20:50.320 --> 1:20:54.880]  and then we put up whether we deserve what we get. I mean it's just wall-to-wall propaganda
[1:20:54.880 --> 1:20:58.560]  by the way I'll hit next segment with Owen and then James O'Keeffe's coming up at the end last
[1:20:58.560 --> 1:21:05.120]  segment of this hour. Wall-to-wall in newspapers, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington
[1:21:05.120 --> 1:21:09.200]  Post, I hardly ever actually read the physical papers but flying back this morning got some at
[1:21:09.200 --> 1:21:15.600]  the airport and every page of just every section local national is oh it's totally safe everyone
[1:21:15.600 --> 1:21:20.640]  loves it no one's gotten sick no one's had a problem and then they have a separate article I haven't
[1:21:20.640 --> 1:21:25.360]  gotten to this on info wars.com that Tucker Carlson covered where they have a church of satan thing
[1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:32.160]  well the satanists are helping save us from covid and how the evil christians have lied
[1:21:33.280 --> 1:21:38.320]  I'm not joking and they have said that the vaccines have killed thousands so we're going to see
[1:21:38.320 --> 1:21:44.400]  who's telling the truth the church of satan the satan lie or the actual VAERS reporting which
[1:21:44.400 --> 1:21:50.800]  is much worse than that next segment but Owen let's get to this clip you've seen the the the
[1:21:51.360 --> 1:21:54.400]  Biden thing I haven't seen it yet I've seen the transcripts it's global government
[1:21:54.400 --> 1:22:00.000]  carbon tax all that but let's hear from him uh recently and also a few years ago about
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:07.360]  where he actually stands here it is we in particularly you your class has an incredible
[1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:15.440]  window of opportunity to lead in shaping a new world order for the 21st century
[1:22:18.080 --> 1:22:26.880]  the affirmative task we have now is uh is to actually um create uh uh a new world order
[1:22:27.680 --> 1:22:34.240]  a new world order I do know a lot about foreign policy as much as anybody in this room including
[1:22:34.240 --> 1:22:42.960]  if you're Henry Kissinger who I love folks we have mortgaged our foreign policy everyone's
[1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:48.000]  out there going oh my god how in god's name you know the chinese came here they the president
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:56.320]  didn't get anything guess what they own us and the full clip they clap that's to the council
[1:22:56.320 --> 1:23:01.040]  on farm relations who've all invested they're the middlemen who get as much as all the chinese
[1:23:01.040 --> 1:23:06.160]  people get in less than 100 families that's what trump said I thought the chinese were bad and gg
[1:23:06.160 --> 1:23:12.080]  ping was bad I met with him our middlemen get more than the whole chinese population so I'm
[1:23:12.080 --> 1:23:16.480]  gonna fix it with gg ping and then when they got rid of trump and stole the election they even
[1:23:16.480 --> 1:23:20.880]  admitted the wall street journal I couldn't believe it I already knew this the wall street
[1:23:20.880 --> 1:23:26.960]  journal this weekend will cover it coming up they even say right there that that's when gg ping
[1:23:26.960 --> 1:23:31.280]  started kicking all the big tech out and taking it over because he saw they were more powerful
[1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:35.600]  than even the american president so see how the globalists thought taking out trump would help
[1:23:35.600 --> 1:23:40.240]  them take over the world but now it's turned their own commies against them because they see
[1:23:40.240 --> 1:23:44.880]  that the big tech actually thinks it's in charge see these leftists don't think long term they don't
[1:23:44.880 --> 1:23:49.360]  think strategically they don't understand real power well think about what joe biden just admitted
[1:23:49.360 --> 1:23:53.760]  in those clips aside from the new world order but in the china's clip specifically folks
[1:23:53.760 --> 1:23:59.360]  a lot of people probably get into government or media with good intentions who knows if that
[1:23:59.360 --> 1:24:04.080]  was biden or not but the point is they see as biden said that we've completely mortgaged the
[1:24:04.080 --> 1:24:09.440]  future of this country to the chinese communists whether it's our manufacturing or industry or
[1:24:09.440 --> 1:24:15.120]  or our culture our entertainment china just runs it all now and so biden just admits it
[1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:21.760]  and I guess he just figures well screw america go china and so that's the problem here people
[1:24:21.760 --> 1:24:25.520]  realize this is going on and then they just figure well i'm not gonna fight it i'm not gonna stand
[1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:29.200]  up i'm not gonna speak the truth i'll just outline what china and i'll line my pockets and i'll be
[1:24:29.200 --> 1:24:32.880]  rich and powerful screw the dirt and they're a little concerned that americans might get together
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:36.880]  and vote this out they put an election fraud and then they have all the entertainers tell us
[1:24:36.880 --> 1:24:42.560]  you know america's hitler and america's mean to jews and we need the big megabanks and claus schwa
[1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:47.360]  who's actually the grandson of the top nazi to run everything and take over and and george soros who
[1:24:47.360 --> 1:24:51.280]  for the best time of his life was rounding up fellow jews i mean it's just twilight zone
[1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:54.880]  but that's that's all they've got is it's all raised as is evil down with american
[1:24:54.880 --> 1:24:58.960]  while they loot the living snot out of us see they sold us out already he already he said we're
[1:24:58.960 --> 1:25:03.520]  mortgaged to china so we're already sold out to them and then he's telling well hey you didn't know
[1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:08.640]  we sold you out how about we just lock your ass up in prison it's beyond stockholms syndrome too at
[1:25:08.640 --> 1:25:14.240]  this point alex where it used to be that the left would 20 maybe they'd engage in some intellectual
[1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:20.720]  debate maybe they'd engage in some conversation about this but now it's no uh we want satanism
[1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:26.320]  satanism is a loophole for for us to kill babies with a heart satanism is our answer to force people
[1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:31.360]  to get vaccines and then the army's showing official power points to thousands of troops
[1:25:31.360 --> 1:25:36.880]  about the satanists are going to help you where does that go i mean where are they going intellectually
[1:25:36.880 --> 1:25:40.960]  where where are they going spiritually where are they going culturally they're telling us
[1:25:40.960 --> 1:25:47.280]  they're going complete evil and and it's driven by hatred is what it is they hate us so much or they
[1:25:47.280 --> 1:25:51.200]  hate america so much or they hate trump so much that was probably the biggest wave of the hatred
[1:25:51.200 --> 1:25:56.400]  for trump that they'll just go anything as long as the media or their politicians that they that
[1:25:56.400 --> 1:26:02.160]  they i guess worship now pits whatever it is against trump or whatever it is against america
[1:26:02.160 --> 1:26:07.760]  or whatever well yeah that's how they got a you know a pen and teller penn gelette to endorse
[1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:11.920]  governor newson he claims he's a libertarian and he just endorsed the guy that's an authoritarian
[1:26:11.920 --> 1:26:17.680]  and now california is going to be going under even more stricter mandates you're chill and you'll
[1:26:17.680 --> 1:26:21.520]  have a mass exit from california and it's funny because the democrats admit they're like yeah
[1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:27.520]  everyone's leaving california it sucks here because of our policy so go to texas and destroy texas
[1:26:27.520 --> 1:26:31.920]  too and then when you're done there go to florida and destroy florida too and then we'll destroy
[1:26:31.920 --> 1:26:36.960]  everything and you americans won't have any states to go to anymore you'll have no cultural you'll
[1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:41.920]  have no freedom well that's the thing about leptis is they they destroy they do the same thing
[1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:46.720]  like i've had a trump say you shouldn't drive a big truck and and tell uh when i was still married
[1:26:46.720 --> 1:26:51.840]  to my ex-wife you know you shouldn't have three kids like whole foods i mean they literally hiss
[1:26:51.840 --> 1:26:57.200]  at families they literally are demons and here's the crazy thing i saw all those stack of newspapers
[1:26:57.200 --> 1:27:00.880]  and and you might not recognize this just because you're not seeing what the kids are seeing as much
[1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:07.680]  as i am there is an individual this individual lil noss he does videos worshiping sodomizing satan
[1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:12.000]  he does videos where he's a man pretending to get pregnant totally sold out to the new world
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:17.200]  order a talentless hack but you know anybody they can in the in the entertainment industry the music
[1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:21.360]  industry they can make anybody successful they want that's why they put nicky minaj on the shelf
[1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:26.240]  and gave you cardi b because they choose who's going to be successful and i saw there's this huge
[1:27:26.240 --> 1:27:32.320]  cover story about lil noss x in one of these papers why because he's sold out he tells you
[1:27:32.320 --> 1:27:37.040]  he's a pregnant male no i saw that every i could do a whole show just all once in newspapers
[1:27:37.040 --> 1:27:41.680]  because it's the most condensed i was in the restaurant at the hotel in dc all three tv's i
[1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:48.320]  shot video of it all three of the tv's had it's safe for children shots for children the shots
[1:27:48.320 --> 1:27:53.600]  are 100 effective just all lying just bombarding every channel so they're getting desperate i saw
[1:27:53.600 --> 1:27:57.600]  the exact same thing on all the national as you were showing it on the local news i saw the exact
[1:27:57.600 --> 1:28:01.600]  same thing on a national loose news level and i think the reason why they do that in the paper
[1:28:01.600 --> 1:28:05.120]  you saw the video i see yeah yeah we played it on the air yesterday and i just i was just saying i
[1:28:05.120 --> 1:28:09.120]  saw it on national tv all morning but i think the reason why they do that in the newspapers is the
[1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:15.040]  same reason why they do it on the view it's just conditioning not to be insensitive here but older
[1:28:15.040 --> 1:28:20.560]  people that are still in the newspaper medium or still in the daytime tv medium to just convince
[1:28:20.560 --> 1:28:26.000]  you you lost america's lost this is the new culture this is what people want so just give up and give
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:31.600]  in when that's not even the case the view is nobody watches the view it's full of illogical
[1:28:31.600 --> 1:28:37.600]  unintellectual fops all right we're gonna come right back with biden i wanted you to see him
[1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:44.800]  earlier declaring uh the worship's china that china owns us we're slaves we no wonder millie says

[1:29:58.560 --> 1:30:03.840]  when bob woodward's new book came out alleging that general milley had called the head of the
[1:30:03.840 --> 1:30:09.040]  chinese military and said trump might nuke you he tried to overthrow the u.s government but basically
[1:30:09.040 --> 1:30:14.320]  i'm protecting you and i'll warn you if we launch an attack which was the greatest reason in u.s history
[1:30:14.320 --> 1:30:18.720]  that has never been committed people said oh alex it must not be true and i might wait bob woodward's
[1:30:18.720 --> 1:30:23.440]  former naval intelligence he's a big insider globalist he wouldn't have put this out unless

[1:33:22.560 --> 1:33:30.720]  well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones so i just played you
[1:33:30.720 --> 1:33:38.400]  hbo and netflix force-fed comedian they put on every channel uh saying america is hitler and
[1:33:38.400 --> 1:33:42.960]  nazi and the american flag is hitler and nazi and we should get rid of america then i showed you
[1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:48.080]  biden saying we're owned by china we're mortgaged at china and they run us now i could play milley
[1:33:48.080 --> 1:33:53.680]  from last week saying it to the troops he didn't just say it in a phone call and then lie and say
[1:33:53.680 --> 1:33:57.440]  our president tried to overthrow the government on january 6 but don't worry i've got the nukes i'm
[1:33:57.440 --> 1:34:03.440]  the boss i mean it's it's and of course jz ping pulled back and and kicked the globalist out and
[1:34:03.440 --> 1:34:08.960]  said i i'm cutting your corporations off you're gonna do this to me to us i mean because you
[1:34:08.960 --> 1:34:13.600]  you think the chai comms want to work with the globalist after they sold out our own country
[1:34:13.600 --> 1:34:17.760]  the chai comms are like you and the world you had all the power why'd you do that because
[1:34:17.760 --> 1:34:22.640]  the globalists are satanic they hate the christian power of america they wanted to corrupt us
[1:34:22.640 --> 1:34:26.240]  it's spiritual well the chai comms are already soulless so they're exporting
[1:34:26.960 --> 1:34:32.640]  all that they're owning hollywood on record now four of the six houses they're having the left
[1:34:32.640 --> 1:34:38.800]  give us the cultural poison but they don't allow it on their airwaves folks so remember that
[1:34:39.520 --> 1:34:43.840]  when you see what's happening this is war and america's pretty much conquered the private
[1:34:43.840 --> 1:34:48.880]  federal reserve the stolen election now they want to mop up the states now they want to mop up
[1:34:50.400 --> 1:34:55.120]  the systems and they're now flushing out all their blue cities as you said earlier to come
[1:34:55.120 --> 1:34:59.440]  invade us and take over with all the decadent slobs they've created who are then going to
[1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:03.440]  find out everything implodes that they're going to be in forced work brigades you know if they
[1:35:03.440 --> 1:35:07.440]  succeed in their takeover oh and can you imagine what is going to be like to all these leftists
[1:35:07.440 --> 1:35:10.320]  who thought they were going to have leadership positions in the communist takeover they're
[1:35:10.320 --> 1:35:15.040]  going to literally be in a forced labor camp or that have just enjoyed the american lifestyle
[1:35:15.040 --> 1:35:20.640]  with the ease of access and and just the the excess and the access it's all going to go to the
[1:35:20.640 --> 1:35:25.440]  wayside and i think what's happening right now alex and it might not even matter at this point
[1:35:25.440 --> 1:35:29.120]  of texas secures the southern border and the by administration may even help them and allow
[1:35:29.120 --> 1:35:32.640]  it they've already got eight to ten million in here illegally in the last year or so so
[1:35:32.640 --> 1:35:38.480]  it may not even matter but what they're doing now is they knew some just signed the bill in
[1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:43.040]  california basically saying that the government can build housing projects anywhere they want
[1:35:43.040 --> 1:35:49.200]  so in california they've created such a bad state for americans to to live in that all the americans
[1:35:49.200 --> 1:35:53.920]  are leaving oh it's a giant third world colony invasion point which is the official un plan
[1:35:53.920 --> 1:35:57.760]  and they're also going to build giant housing areas in northern california in the middle of rural
[1:35:57.760 --> 1:36:02.080]  areas to then import those groups that they didn't get welfare to that has been paid out to the
[1:36:02.080 --> 1:36:09.040]  democrat NGOs so now the democrat voting locusts are being moved to texas and montana and idaho
[1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:13.680]  and florida traditionally red states so they can flip them blue because you know they're not very
[1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:17.120]  smart they're just going to import that policy to destroy other states and by the way that was
[1:36:17.120 --> 1:36:21.760]  obama's last deal he signed an executive order when he left to get rid of single dwelling homes
[1:36:21.760 --> 1:36:27.120]  family homes they don't want those so now they're going to import their millions of illegal immigrants
[1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:31.840]  into the suburbs of california and they won't lose california because they'll amnesty all of
[1:36:31.840 --> 1:36:36.960]  them so they'll be voting democrat whether they do or not is irrelevant the democrats will just vote
[1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:41.440]  for them and so they'll ballot harvest they'll put all the illegals on welfare and then milk part of
[1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:46.080]  that off and so that's the plan for california exodus of all the american people after they
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:51.120]  destroyed the economy and then and then send all those democrat locusts to the red states to flip
[1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:55.360]  those states and while the global issues the trillions and fiat currency that we've got to
[1:36:55.360 --> 1:37:00.720]  pay back with taxes as biden expands the irs the biggest has ever been so he says working class
[1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:04.320]  middle class you're all going to be taxed the billionaires are all tax exempt they're going to
[1:37:04.320 --> 1:37:08.480]  tax all the middle class and poor people to pay for the illegal aliens i mean this is an admitted
[1:37:08.480 --> 1:37:12.880]  military takeover and they want to be in your bank account because they're well aware that you may
[1:37:12.880 --> 1:37:18.480]  have assets or or a cryptocurrency and they want to know they want to know how or you may sell
[1:37:18.480 --> 1:37:22.320]  a old tractor you may get some cash and they want to know about it they got to know they
[1:37:22.320 --> 1:37:25.840]  governance got to get their cut and the democrats vote for all of it as they stand against big
[1:37:25.840 --> 1:37:34.000]  governments so they say but you know this is why the national divorce is taking such a serious
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:41.040]  topic of debate right now alex because at what point do texas and florida or missouri or some
[1:37:41.040 --> 1:37:46.240]  of these other conservative states say look we've seen what you've done to your states we're not
[1:37:46.240 --> 1:37:51.040]  going to let you do it here look you're right this is a formula to conquer america using
[1:37:51.040 --> 1:37:55.920]  third world populations that's in all the un documents and speaking of that i want to get to
[1:37:55.920 --> 1:38:02.000]  the biden clip we're out of time let's do that next hour from the un and all the incredible
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  announcements we'll probably rear those clips they need to go together where he's you know up there
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:11.280]  saying china runs us owns us but just think about imagine if ronald reagan said china owns us it's
[1:38:11.280 --> 1:38:15.760]  over we need to submit to them imagine if the chairman of the joint chiefs said that under
[1:38:15.760 --> 1:38:22.960]  george w bush george dobush will be you know removed it's they've gotten so used to all these
[1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:27.440]  comics and all these hollywood people and all these conquerors saying they care about everybody
[1:38:27.440 --> 1:38:32.560]  and then bringing in third world populations to hate america and hate white people it's just sick
[1:38:32.560 --> 1:38:39.680]  and i'll say this about finances in full wars is like a mothership now that boost project veritas
[1:38:39.680 --> 1:38:43.600]  and they'll tell you that and that boost everybody else they've taken down almost everybody else
[1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:48.960]  tucker carlson's there we're there that's about it at a at a major level that'll really tell you
[1:38:48.960 --> 1:38:54.400]  what's going on at a hardcore point you know you've got like ben sapiro at first is for the vaccine
[1:38:54.400 --> 1:38:59.760]  pushing it and now he's like oh well it shouldn't be forced and i'm not in competition with ben sapiro
[1:39:01.040 --> 1:39:06.000]  but he's what the system sells the algorithm of google pushes him because that's what they want you
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:11.760]  to hear is is that type of pinhead conservatism that doesn't really get into the the depths of
[1:39:11.760 --> 1:39:17.280]  what's happening this makes it more of a cultural fight the culture war is an artificial weapon system
[1:39:17.280 --> 1:39:20.960]  to play us off against each other we need to understand we're at war we're being attacked
[1:39:21.920 --> 1:39:26.320]  and come together as americans every race color and creed against the foreign banks coming in
[1:39:26.320 --> 1:39:32.960]  to bankrupt us and create a universal basic income so that said i need you to tell everybody
[1:39:32.960 --> 1:39:37.440]  about the show you've been doing it we're having a huge effect and we're like one of the main guns
[1:39:37.440 --> 1:39:42.080]  in the info war that's sinking a lot of globalist lies and rallying the people that means we've got
[1:39:42.080 --> 1:39:45.680]  to do more we've got to fight harder we've got to be stronger and i've been doing that i've been
[1:39:45.680 --> 1:39:52.080]  working 14 to 16 hours a day some days more and i've been really focused because i'm here to mobilize
[1:39:52.080 --> 1:39:56.000]  people we're not here to even try to get sheep to wake up anymore we're here to get people that are
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:00.240]  already awake that are already taking action realize now's the time for maximum effort to block
[1:40:00.240 --> 1:40:04.320]  the globalist and then the sheep will see our leadership which they're seeing and figure out
[1:40:04.320 --> 1:40:09.520]  that we were right and join us but at this point we just got to tell it like it is lay it all out
[1:40:09.520 --> 1:40:14.320]  and financially support info wars you need all the products we have already so everybody needs
[1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:18.400]  to just say they're coming after me and my family they're coming after alex we're all in this together

[1:42:03.680 --> 1:42:09.040]  the video we're about to break down well this is one of those things maybe a straw that can break
[1:42:09.040 --> 1:42:15.120]  the camel's back coming from inside hospitals coming from federal health care workers telling
[1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:20.560]  you you've been lied to about the vaccine inside the hospitals they know it's killing people the
[1:42:20.560 --> 1:42:25.520]  veirs reports they're not even fully reporting it we have that too so the 15 000 deaths from the
[1:42:25.520 --> 1:42:30.160]  vaccines this year uh did they now admit that that's only a fraction of them and it's all in this
[1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:36.640]  one little report i mean where does project veritas go next i mean two the stars for project veritas
[1:42:36.640 --> 1:42:41.280]  and what's incredible people say are these federal regulators and nurses and doctors right
[1:42:41.280 --> 1:42:45.200]  it's all in the original report that i've got right here from october where the feds knew
[1:42:45.200 --> 1:42:49.760]  was going to cause these reactions this was premeditated bouncy works for the rockefeller
[1:42:49.760 --> 1:42:57.040]  foundation and gates they made the weapons with the chinese they released it were under attack
[1:42:57.040 --> 1:43:02.240]  we've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp in
[1:43:02.240 --> 1:43:07.200]  world war two that when they came for one group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up
[1:43:07.200 --> 1:43:10.560]  and then when they came for another group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up
[1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:16.080]  and finally when they came for him there was nobody else to stand up oh the global social
[1:43:16.080 --> 1:43:20.560]  credit score that china is putting in that's banning people the three hours of video games a week and
[1:43:20.560 --> 1:43:25.120]  if you criticize the government you can never buy or sell again well that's that's being brought
[1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:30.000]  here and all over the world under the guise of covid vaccine passports they even admit it now
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:33.520]  they're saying it's going to be a carbon tax attached to it they're going to track where you
[1:43:33.520 --> 1:43:38.160]  go and what you do and decide where you can go and what you can do that's what the lockdowns are
[1:43:38.160 --> 1:43:43.920]  about you'll accept that you'll accept anything so again the left is having fun right now with all
[1:43:43.920 --> 1:43:47.920]  the censorship and tyranny pretending like they're part of the power structure but they're all going
[1:43:47.920 --> 1:43:52.480]  to be targeted by this nightmare as well we need to get back to basic human rights and promote them
[1:43:52.480 --> 1:43:57.520]  or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalist i've been fighting
[1:43:57.520 --> 1:44:04.000]  as hard as i can for almost 28 years against the globalist i wanted to stop their agenda i wanted
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:10.240]  to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational but we failed
[1:44:10.240 --> 1:44:15.120]  yes a lot of people are awake yes we're not getting caught flat footed but they are going
[1:44:15.120 --> 1:44:21.040]  ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset and that's why it's more important
[1:44:21.040 --> 1:44:26.320]  than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people
[1:44:26.320 --> 1:44:30.640]  are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth so we've got an information warfare the enemy and
[1:44:30.640 --> 1:44:34.880]  try to stop their agenda we've also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one

[1:47:59.520 --> 1:48:04.880]  james oh keeps coming on next hour he had an emergency come up but from their studios jody
[1:48:04.880 --> 1:48:13.840]  o'Malley msn rn hhs whistleblower in the bombshell now censored off a bunch of platforms interview
[1:48:13.840 --> 1:48:18.880]  with her and others seeing people come in and get sick seeing them getting very very ill having
[1:48:18.880 --> 1:48:23.040]  covered like some of the vaccine i've been told it's my medical doctors that run hospitals on air
[1:48:23.040 --> 1:48:27.040]  i've been told it off record as well because they're scared i know some doctors here in austin
[1:48:28.160 --> 1:48:32.400]  that took care of my parents that are very nice husband and wife who work at a major hospital
[1:48:32.400 --> 1:48:37.040]  and they said they're told basically not to say that it's the injections that are doing it and
[1:48:37.040 --> 1:48:42.000]  then we know officially for 14 days if you die in 14 days that we're getting madonna or phyzer
[1:48:42.640 --> 1:48:49.760]  the fda and the cdc don't count that as a vaccinated person so if you take those numbers
[1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:54.320]  and add together with all the numbers we've got it's it's pretty shocking so jody o'Malley we
[1:48:54.320 --> 1:48:59.200]  appreciate your courage and what you've done and you know now we've seen your whistleblower stuff
[1:48:59.200 --> 1:49:04.800]  your undercover things so great to have you here tell us about yourself and why you've gone public
[1:49:04.800 --> 1:49:08.880]  and just what you what you want to warn people because i know you're here to warn people and
[1:49:08.880 --> 1:49:13.040]  you've put your whole you know job on the line and they're so scary because you're with health and
[1:49:13.040 --> 1:49:17.520]  human services to have somebody like you come out and tell the truth so thank you for standing up
[1:49:17.520 --> 1:49:25.600]  against these crimes against humanity and for the nuremberg code thank you um so i am a masters
[1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:33.040]  prepared critical care nurse um i graduated nursing school and i was 39 so just eight years ago or
[1:49:33.040 --> 1:49:41.440]  something um it's always been a passion of mine to help people in that way um and being a nurse
[1:49:41.440 --> 1:49:49.040]  in my hospital i work float pools so i see it all i see it from the people coming into the
[1:49:49.040 --> 1:49:58.960]  emergency room that are fine um the some that are not so fine most are fine um i see it from a med
[1:49:58.960 --> 1:50:05.680]  surge nurse perspective i see it from an intensive care nurse perspective and i also see it from an
[1:50:05.680 --> 1:50:12.560]  administrative perspective because i work house supervisor so i'm also very much privy to the
[1:50:12.560 --> 1:50:19.760]  reporting and how these numbers are reported so you're in a key position both from training
[1:50:19.760 --> 1:50:25.360]  and jobs and managerial areas to get a really good wide spectrum view of this to be able to
[1:50:25.360 --> 1:50:31.440]  give us an expert opinion is what you're saying absolutely and you know i have a lot of nurse
[1:50:31.440 --> 1:50:40.960]  friends that are just in one area you know um er or icu or med surge and i'm screaming to them like
[1:50:40.960 --> 1:50:47.760]  stop putting out that fear guys like you're only seeing it you're seeing the sickest of the sick
[1:50:48.480 --> 1:50:56.720]  right i mean that's kind of hard to see on a daily basis um but then there's so 99.7 percent that
[1:50:56.720 --> 1:51:02.880]  aren't you know well they have fought and i'm sure you know this instagram a bunch of the places
[1:51:02.880 --> 1:51:06.960]  have pulled it we're gonna have james on next hour about this but imagine you have a voices
[1:51:06.960 --> 1:51:12.480]  in american this video goes out you show the proof with other valiant individuals and now
[1:51:12.480 --> 1:51:15.520]  they're trying to silence you but we've got millions of listeners and viewers are going to
[1:51:15.520 --> 1:51:19.680]  take this interview they're going to magnify it so here's your chance to do what you've been doing
[1:51:19.680 --> 1:51:25.600]  and and and to break this burlin wall this electronic iron curtain of censorship and and
[1:51:25.600 --> 1:51:31.840]  to warn people as a caregiver who wants to help people tell us what's really happening well what's
[1:51:31.840 --> 1:51:39.200]  really happening is um the the reporting of the numbers are very skewed we're getting a lot of
[1:51:39.200 --> 1:51:46.400]  hospital admissions um you know the doc will call up and tell me hey i got a a covid pneumonia
[1:51:47.440 --> 1:51:53.920]  they're gonna go to med surge observation say right and i said okay are they on oxygen no
[1:51:55.200 --> 1:52:00.800]  okay well why are we admitting them right that that's one perspective here's another
[1:52:00.800 --> 1:52:11.040]  perspective i'll get um a diabetic ketoacidosis emission um that they're there for an extremely
[1:52:11.040 --> 1:52:18.480]  high uncontrolled blood sugar um but they're covid positive so now they're added to my covid
[1:52:18.480 --> 1:52:26.720]  admissions but covid is just an incidental finding that has nothing to do with it right um
[1:52:26.720 --> 1:52:34.480]  um you know and then also to the early treatment i've known about the frontline doctors in america's
[1:52:34.480 --> 1:52:42.160]  frontline doctors when i saw them last year i was like yes yes yes somebody's speaking out
[1:52:42.160 --> 1:52:49.360]  like yay this will change and it only got worse and um and it's because of the censorship it's
[1:52:49.360 --> 1:52:56.960]  it's because they're um having you know no scientific debate is allowed and for me when
[1:52:56.960 --> 1:53:04.480]  that happened to my co-worker um who wanted the ivermectin and didn't get it um you know
[1:53:04.480 --> 1:53:10.800]  prior to that there's an ER doc that i really hope comes forward um because he's been instrumental
[1:53:10.800 --> 1:53:17.120]  in this with me and he was telling me jody it's it's not chess it's chat or it's not checkers it's
[1:53:17.120 --> 1:53:24.000]  chess and um and i said okay you're right now that i know enough about um early treatment
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:30.080]  i'm just going to start telling everybody about it you know and um and just speaking up and saying
[1:53:30.080 --> 1:53:38.640]  hey guys this is an option and um and then when my um my boss brought me into the office and said
[1:53:38.640 --> 1:53:44.080]  they're going to start reporting you to the board of nursing for speaking against anything that
[1:53:44.080 --> 1:53:50.240]  the FDA has not used for an emergency youth authorization and again i've talked to medical
[1:53:50.240 --> 1:53:54.080]  doctors face to face in austin my parents have talked to other doctors face to face and told them
[1:53:54.080 --> 1:53:58.080]  the same thing who are quitting and leaving and setting up their own practices because they're
[1:53:58.080 --> 1:54:03.040]  so freaked out by this and let's be clear they've been using a PCR test that's false positive 94
[1:54:03.040 --> 1:54:07.040]  percent of the time even according to the new york times to then sometimes even put people in the
[1:54:07.040 --> 1:54:11.600]  hospital that like you said are having diabetic shock or something they'll still i've read the
[1:54:11.600 --> 1:54:16.640]  articles out of new york stick a ventilator down their throat and it's just crazy what you're seeing
[1:54:16.640 --> 1:54:22.000]  is what the corporatization how they give the orders from on high and then that's implemented
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:25.680]  regardless what the doctors and nurses are saying and then if you speak out they were
[1:54:25.680 --> 1:54:29.760]  going to get you in trouble so you i guess you and others i've seen the videos recorded other
[1:54:29.760 --> 1:54:34.720]  people agreeing with you to show that you weren't the only one is that what happened oh yeah so many
[1:54:34.720 --> 1:54:42.000]  people agree with me i mean as far as a pcs a pcr test goes um that that was never intended to be
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:49.680]  diagnostic but yet we've drove this entire pandemic over two narratives in my mind one asymptomatic
[1:54:49.680 --> 1:54:57.680]  transmission telling people that they can kill someone and not know it um completely unscientific
[1:54:57.680 --> 1:55:05.600]  rarely rarely rarely ever happens and pcr tests that there's no standard at my hospital when i was
[1:55:05.600 --> 1:55:10.960]  house supervisor i went downstairs and i talked to our lab department and i said what's our cycle
[1:55:10.960 --> 1:55:21.120]  threshold and they said 51 minutes it's only supposed to be at the max 24 to have any clinical
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:27.920]  significance so you can see where you know every single hospital everybody's doing it different
[1:55:27.920 --> 1:55:34.960]  no lab is ever the same all labs are have different different cycle thresholds so what are we doing
[1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:40.640]  you know where do you see this going because there are armies of nurses and doctors and scientists
[1:55:40.640 --> 1:55:44.720]  and even now the fda scientists came out and said don't give children this don't give boosters the
[1:55:44.720 --> 1:55:49.200]  media didn't even report on that that happened last friday and saturday so i i mean i see the
[1:55:49.200 --> 1:55:54.160]  corporations moving forward no matter what comes out but i see it creating a massive resistance
[1:55:54.160 --> 1:56:02.640]  worldwide where do you see this going well i where i hope it goes is for people to not operate in
[1:56:02.640 --> 1:56:10.320]  fear and to stick to that little whisper that you know we're given to us by god you know that is not
[1:56:10.320 --> 1:56:16.240]  from that doesn't happen from our own ego you know and when you get that little feeling not to do
[1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:22.640]  something don't do it start conforming your communities of people so that if you need a
[1:56:22.640 --> 1:56:27.920]  doctor if you're sick you know you can reach out to them and and you'll have somebody if you need a
[1:56:27.920 --> 1:56:33.680]  chiropractor if you need food you got a farmer those types of things absolutely and i hope you
[1:56:33.680 --> 1:56:37.600]  can stay with us longer because i want to every doctor and every nurse we have almost been through
[1:56:37.600 --> 1:56:42.000]  this especially the ones that have been a battle tested and have all these different disciplinary
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:47.040]  you know degrees tell us that you got to go out and find the good hospitals and doctors now
[1:56:47.040 --> 1:56:52.480]  because if you find the wrong ones you're dead absolutely i mean right now everybody needs to
[1:56:52.480 --> 1:56:58.720]  take their health seriously um you know we don't know how this virus will mutate and and what they'll
[1:56:58.720 --> 1:57:06.880]  come up with next but overall i want to tell people this for the overall majority 99.7 percent
[1:57:06.880 --> 1:57:13.920]  will survive and be okay okay so don't think like this is just something like oh you're
[1:57:13.920 --> 1:57:18.160]  you know we're all gonna die and you're but that's if they get the right treatment correct
[1:57:18.160 --> 1:57:24.720]  not if you get a ventilator but no that's even before the vaccine came out those are our numbers
[1:57:24.720 --> 1:57:30.000]  wow okay stay there well i want to hear about the whistleblowing for people that haven't seen
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:35.920]  the full report and project veritas it's also up on info wars this is a war folks an info war
[1:57:35.920 --> 1:57:42.640]  and so it's the covid-19 vaccine exposed part one it's a project veritas's website we have a very
[1:57:42.640 --> 1:57:50.480]  special guest jody o'Malley finally vitamin d3 and vitamin k that are both essential are getting
[1:57:50.480 --> 1:57:55.200]  the respect and the attention they deserve we've got a great product it's been out for six years
[1:57:55.200 --> 1:58:00.480]  winter sun long before the big crisis came along we were there saying this is high quality this will
[1:58:00.480 --> 1:58:04.480]  make you healthy this will be better for you and your family but what else doesn't get attention
[1:58:04.480 --> 1:58:10.320]  and needs to be looked at is vitamin b12 it is just as essential it is just as important
[1:58:10.320 --> 1:58:14.800]  and it is amazing and it's not just about your immune system it's about every part of your body
[1:58:15.520 --> 1:58:21.680]  it's it's really a hormone and it's what your building blocks of your entire body operate off of
[1:58:21.680 --> 1:58:28.080]  so these vitamins are essential vitamin d3 and of course vitamin b12 go together like a horse
[1:58:28.080 --> 1:58:32.400]  and carriage do your own research we've got the highest grades you're going to find out there
[1:58:32.400 --> 1:58:36.480]  and they're taken under the tongue it's key to put it under the tongue for about a minute
[1:58:36.480 --> 1:58:42.720]  and let it sit so your blood vessels absorb it they're both available 50 off at infowarstore.com
[1:58:42.720 --> 1:58:50.800]  together or by themselves at 50 off at 25 off the purpose of fear is to call us into action
[1:58:50.800 --> 1:58:56.400]  and there is plenty to be afraid of today half the population has lined up for an untested
[1:58:56.400 --> 1:59:01.600]  deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible
[1:59:01.600 --> 1:59:07.520]  asymptomatic disease the perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80 percent
[1:59:07.520 --> 1:59:13.360]  of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years
[1:59:13.360 --> 1:59:17.920]  for those of us who have awoken from the spell we know this is all really happening and it's
[1:59:17.920 --> 1:59:24.320]  unbelievably unsettling to see but there is only two things to do we continue sounding the alarm
[1:59:24.320 --> 1:59:29.440]  because it's a numbers game if enough people awaken from the cold spell then we win but even
[1:59:29.440 --> 1:59:35.280]  when we win and we eventually will the days of convenience are soon coming to an end and so we
[1:59:35.280 --> 1:59:42.240]  must prepare get up to a year's worth of storable foods water filtration survival gear seeds
[1:59:42.240 --> 1:59:47.120]  shortwave radios and lifesaving knowledge at infowarstore.com
[1:59:47.120 --> 1:59:57.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:09.360 --> 2:00:13.120]  well jody o'Malley is only five more minutes whether somebody get her back up which you can do a
[2:00:13.120 --> 2:00:18.480]  longer interview but but just you've got the floor here and the five minutes we have what else
[2:00:18.480 --> 2:00:25.040]  as a major whistleblower msn rn hhs whistleblower in health and human services what else do you
[2:00:25.040 --> 2:00:36.720]  want to impart to this audience i want people to know that um but let's take our kids for example
[2:00:36.720 --> 2:00:44.400]  okay from the ages of zero to seventeen there's approximately 75 million but maybe last week
[2:00:44.400 --> 2:00:53.360]  or something i saw that there were 400 deaths with a positive covid number or with a positive
[2:00:53.360 --> 2:01:02.720]  covid result okay so 400 and a population of 75 million to give you an idea i believe
[2:01:02.720 --> 2:01:10.960]  that there is about 50 000 that have died um over the last 18 months just of it's a normal
[2:01:10.960 --> 2:01:18.880]  number right um everything is included in that suicides birth um cancer all of it okay so out
[2:01:18.880 --> 2:01:26.320]  of that you have 400 or so deaths with a positive covid number if you just look at the facts that
[2:01:26.320 --> 2:01:36.640]  is statistically a zero percent chance of dying zero okay so the fact that they're pushing this on
[2:01:36.640 --> 2:01:45.600]  the on our kids is absolutely evil at its highest form because there is no reason for it kids mostly
[2:01:45.600 --> 2:01:52.080]  have asymptomatic right they don't even know they have it and if they do have it they are they
[2:01:52.080 --> 2:02:00.080]  just have like a cold life symptoms but yet we are ruining their education and messing with their
[2:02:00.080 --> 2:02:07.920]  spiritual and mental health like no other um so please um i do not recommend at all for
[2:02:08.960 --> 2:02:15.200]  really honestly um i let me put it to you this way my dad who has almost every cold morbidity
[2:02:15.200 --> 2:02:22.880]  um that you can imagine um i do not recommend the vaccine for him okay and again i'm sure
[2:02:22.880 --> 2:02:25.840]  you know no better than i but it's not even technically a vaccine they've had to change
[2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:29.520]  the definition of that it's a gene gene therapy and and and just for folks that don't know
[2:02:30.560 --> 2:02:34.400]  from your expert view why do you think they're so hell bent on targeting children even though
[2:02:34.400 --> 2:02:38.640]  they know there's going to be problems and deaths particularly it's been already in teenagers
[2:02:38.640 --> 2:02:43.680]  why are they being so reckless so crazy it's like a gun is the Fauci and mill gates his head
[2:02:43.680 --> 2:02:46.240]  what are you and the other nurses and doctors things behind this
[2:02:48.480 --> 2:02:55.840]  well um about control um i've had people tell me that they think it you know to sterilize the
[2:02:55.840 --> 2:03:04.160]  children um to kill off our children um in some way shape or form a really whole society um i

[2:03:19.680 --> 2:03:26.320]  just a bad word now i almost take pride in that word because conspiracy theorist almost is like
[2:03:26.320 --> 2:03:30.720]  you're a critical thinker and that's what they don't want you to do anymore they don't want you
[2:03:30.720 --> 2:03:36.480]  to critically think they just want you to comply and and and uh are you being persecuted are you
[2:03:36.480 --> 2:03:40.800]  being fired and i know that you're going through a lot doing this how was your job right now

[2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:56.000]  them that i needed to take care of my spiritual and mental health and that i needed to um really
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:04:02.960]  step back and think what it meant to be a federal employee and uphold my oath to do no harm at the
[2:04:02.960 --> 2:04:07.040]  same time let me ask you a question did you have a burning to warn people when you saw this happen

[2:06:21.600 --> 2:06:27.440]  the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip big iron on his hip
[2:06:30.800 --> 2:06:34.640]  it was early in the morning when he rode into the town
[2:06:36.880 --> 2:06:40.880]  he came riding from the south side slowly looking all around
[2:06:43.120 --> 2:06:47.360]  he's an outlaw loosen running came the whispered from each lip
[2:06:47.360 --> 2:06:53.600]  and he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip big iron on his hip
[2:06:53.600 --> 2:06:55.760]  we are back live now into hour number three
[2:06:56.400 --> 2:07:01.440]  dames oakie just had an amazing whistleblower jody o'Malley very powerful all of us he'll be joining
[2:07:01.440 --> 2:07:05.440]  us later in the hour he's in emergency meeting so much is breaking i know the feeling of being
[2:07:05.440 --> 2:07:09.600]  in a war room where just stuff is coming in so fast and you've just got to defend the republic
[2:07:09.600 --> 2:07:15.760]  what an incredible time borders wide open un financed invasions all the big comedians you know
[2:07:15.760 --> 2:07:22.000]  that the media is pushing saying america sucks america's nazis america's hitler get rid of america
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:27.360]  american flags are bad world government's good biden pledging allegiance to china we played at last
[2:07:27.360 --> 2:07:33.680]  hour sink china owns us we are mortgaged you know there's nothing we can do uh and laughing about
[2:07:33.680 --> 2:07:40.800]  the crowd clapping milley saying it all of this and then you hear jody o'Malley she's what they fear
[2:07:40.800 --> 2:07:46.720]  before they get their robots in place which is long off is their own people finding their soul
[2:07:46.720 --> 2:07:52.480]  and standing up and she's so empowered now recording the doctors recording other nurses
[2:07:52.480 --> 2:07:57.280]  knowing it's the vaccines admitting it's the vaccines i mean there's like 30 minutes of doctors
[2:07:57.280 --> 2:08:02.400]  and all the vaccine got it killed them oh they're dying oh our own nurses are dying from the shot
[2:08:02.400 --> 2:08:06.960]  and then they're all gonna report her because she bitched on facebook or instagram so she just
[2:08:06.960 --> 2:08:13.120]  recorded all them admitting they know what they're doing the let me look fancy and i know bill gates
[2:08:13.120 --> 2:08:16.960]  has a compulsion to kill people he can't help it so everybody thinks well they must be in charge
[2:08:16.960 --> 2:08:21.040]  if they're doing this no they're just like every other tyrant they're gonna lose because they're
[2:08:21.040 --> 2:08:27.680]  not gonna stop until all of you have to finally wake up or you're dead so they will go down they're
[2:08:27.680 --> 2:08:31.840]  making a real run at us i've studied history so everybody better get that through your heads and
[2:08:31.840 --> 2:08:36.000]  i mean that to our general audience but also the dumbo liberals that tune in you're not part of the
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:41.440]  establishment you're useless eaters to the globalist i don't want to kill you i don't want to be at
[2:08:41.440 --> 2:08:48.800]  war with you i want to empower you but i assure you that you are dead in the next decade or so
[2:08:48.800 --> 2:08:51.840]  with this plan because you heard that nurse earlier she said i don't know what they're gonna hit us
[2:08:51.840 --> 2:08:56.560]  with next all the doctors know they've already looked at it under microscopes they've already
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:09:01.600]  looked at its synthetic spike protein that they could be spraying on us or it's coming from the
[2:09:01.600 --> 2:09:07.840]  vaccine the fea voted 16 to 2 saturday and their scientists kept getting up there on the board the
[2:09:08.560 --> 2:09:15.120]  saying saying that it's the vaccine that caused this but i'm not even sure if that's the case
[2:09:15.120 --> 2:09:19.760]  oh and what do you make of this incredible time we're alive and right now well she said something
[2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:26.400]  she said hey you know alice i hadn't heard of you until about a year ago and maybe i saw your
[2:09:26.400 --> 2:09:31.120]  name and you were labeled as a conspiracy theorist or the guest you had on and what i'm seeing
[2:09:31.120 --> 2:09:36.480]  happening now is that info wars use whatever analogy it's like a funnel of truth or a black hole of
[2:09:36.480 --> 2:09:41.760]  reality and it's you know and it is well you know anytime in a funnel the the point where it goes
[2:09:41.760 --> 2:09:48.240]  through is the smallest point so somebody like jody o'Malley wants to warn americans what's going on
[2:09:48.240 --> 2:09:52.160]  with the vaccines what's going on with hospitals so she thinks okay well the outer rim is the
[2:09:52.160 --> 2:09:56.240]  mainstream media so that's where you start and she realizes wait none of these people are interested
[2:09:56.240 --> 2:10:00.560]  in covering the story in fact they're covering it up what is going on here and so slowly but
[2:10:00.560 --> 2:10:05.760]  surely she gets all the way down to the bottom of the funnel of reality the bottom of the black hole
[2:10:05.760 --> 2:10:11.520]  of truth and where is it it's info wars nobody else will have these guests on or veritas they're all
[2:10:11.520 --> 2:10:15.520]  afraid it's project veritas it's info wars and there's others great and tucker carlson but no
[2:10:15.520 --> 2:10:20.000]  we're only saying we are at the center of it i mean tucker carlson says that publicly because
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:24.800]  we're under attack and that's why you praying for us is the one that's more important than money
[2:10:24.800 --> 2:10:29.040]  more important than word of mouth folks we need those prayers as a literal spiritual force field
[2:10:29.040 --> 2:10:33.760]  because i can feel it and see it yeah there's no doubt and it's all of us coming together and you
[2:10:33.760 --> 2:10:42.720]  know here's the other thing too alex people have been living agnostic or atheistic lifestyles because
[2:10:42.720 --> 2:10:47.440]  they haven't really seen the evil or been faced with the evil now the evil is just out and then
[2:10:47.440 --> 2:10:51.040]  the general public is gonna get worse they're everywhere and so people are naturally turning
[2:10:51.040 --> 2:10:56.320]  back to god it's like they say there's no atheists and fossil and foxholes there's they're seeing
[2:10:56.320 --> 2:11:03.360]  the saintness praise abortion they're seeing the leftist mad that they can't stop a beating heart
[2:11:03.360 --> 2:11:08.560]  in the womb they're seeing the borders being surrendered by biden they're they're seeing the
[2:11:08.560 --> 2:11:14.080]  politicians and the media lie to them 24 7 they're seeing all of these institutions and
[2:11:14.080 --> 2:11:20.080]  establishments in the legacy media and and political class just done done with the constitution
[2:11:20.080 --> 2:11:24.160]  done with the bill of rights done with your sovereignty done with all of it and and and
[2:11:24.160 --> 2:11:29.520]  they're realizing woes there it really is something at my doorstep obama said don't listen to the
[2:11:29.520 --> 2:11:35.920]  voices out there telling you tyrannies around the corner really barack here we are 2021 right around
[2:11:35.920 --> 2:11:42.640]  the corner and what do we see global government world tyranny medical tyranny if i go around this
[2:11:42.640 --> 2:11:47.520]  if you if you went out and you asked somebody because people's brains don't really function
[2:11:47.520 --> 2:11:52.400]  very well sadly these days with the with the food and the tv and everything and you said hi sir
[2:11:52.400 --> 2:11:57.680]  here are you for forced medication the natural response we know i'm not for forced medication
[2:11:57.680 --> 2:12:02.400]  of course not but then if you said are you for forcing people to take a vaccine a vaccine many
[2:12:02.400 --> 2:12:08.720]  well well or you sir you for them forcing experimental medicines on you yeah you can go
[2:12:08.720 --> 2:12:13.120]  even because it's experimental then they lied and said it wasn't but imagine as tucker carlson
[2:12:13.120 --> 2:12:17.840]  has said it as a bell said it hell even there's a video of a australian police officer being
[2:12:17.840 --> 2:12:21.600]  confronted about this thing well i don't like it either i'm just doing my job i'm just doing what
[2:12:21.600 --> 2:12:27.200]  they tell me to do really well if they told you to put a cult 45 up against their head and blow
[2:12:27.200 --> 2:12:31.920]  their brains out would you do that too where is the line where is the line and by the way i want
[2:12:31.920 --> 2:12:35.520]  to go back to the photo they just put up for tv viewers radio listeners you can see this it's a
[2:12:35.520 --> 2:12:41.520]  bunch of so-called movie stars and and and quote hip-hop and music stars doing the illuminati one
[2:12:41.520 --> 2:12:46.720]  eye where they put their you know index and thumb together and the other three fingers sticking out
[2:12:46.720 --> 2:12:55.600]  so that symbolizes occultism and satanism and luciferianism today but really god is connected
[2:12:55.600 --> 2:13:00.080]  to us through our third eye our spirit which they now scientifically know is you know just
[2:13:00.080 --> 2:13:05.200]  an interface in our brain but to a dimensional point beyond our dimension so they're all saying
[2:13:05.200 --> 2:13:09.920]  they're the illuminati they're illuminating they have the third eye so we then think illumination
[2:13:09.920 --> 2:13:14.320]  is bad we didn't think the third eye is bad they all have counterfeited that for satan and are
[2:13:14.320 --> 2:13:17.920]  saying with the third eye they're saying they're the other dimension they're saying they're the
[2:13:17.920 --> 2:13:21.760]  connection to god but they're they're opposite they're the ones that don't have the connection to god
[2:13:21.760 --> 2:13:26.080]  they're the ones that have sold out to satan and most of them probably don't even have a clue what
[2:13:26.080 --> 2:13:31.280]  they're getting involved with until they see it firsthand like that one young lady who talked
[2:13:31.280 --> 2:13:36.080]  about going to a halloween party where they were taking your blood and said you can't have cell
[2:13:36.080 --> 2:13:39.920]  phones and that's not how you open your third eye that's how you open yourself up to demonic
[2:13:39.920 --> 2:13:44.400]  low-level stuff if you open up the third eye that's the holy spirit folks then you're you start seeing
[2:13:44.400 --> 2:13:50.000]  further and further interconnected to the universe and god and it and satanists have zero of that
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:54.880]  and you realize when you're into devil worship you have zero third eye zero they all tell you
[2:13:54.880 --> 2:14:00.160]  they've got it because they do not have it they are going to take that away from you and you
[2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:04.640]  realize how small you are look how pathetic they are these people do not have a third eye that's open
[2:14:04.640 --> 2:14:11.280]  yep marina abramovich with a jz there but alex here's what it comes down to as we come look up
[2:14:11.280 --> 2:14:14.880]  around to act like they're powerful all these weak if you imagine being in a room look at them just
[2:14:14.880 --> 2:14:19.520]  look at the empty weaknesses people you can feel the resonance of that that is the lowest level
[2:14:19.520 --> 2:14:25.200]  of failure on screen i want to be as far away from that as possible that has zero attractiveness to me
[2:14:25.200 --> 2:14:30.320]  at all none of it you know the third eye is is on a mountaintop with your children and your wife
[2:14:30.320 --> 2:14:34.640]  is praising god and saying thank you god for this great creation you gave us thank you for your son
[2:14:34.640 --> 2:14:39.920]  that opens the third eye as we close this segment alex here's here's the here's the big picture
[2:14:39.920 --> 2:14:44.640]  that everybody needs to understand that you've been talking about for years the global elite
[2:14:45.360 --> 2:14:51.280]  have created a breakaway civilization they're done with us okay the ship's about to leave the
[2:14:51.280 --> 2:14:56.720]  planet not literally but but they think literally but this is the plan they've been building a separate
[2:14:56.720 --> 2:15:01.280]  society they're ready to break away from us they're ready to rip the cord on us they're done
[2:15:01.280 --> 2:15:05.680]  and and and they look at it like they're doing us a favor alex well we're gonna spare you and
[2:15:05.680 --> 2:15:10.640]  make us our slaves and our batteries and we'll feed you some garbage and we'll feed you some poop
[2:15:10.640 --> 2:15:15.600]  water and we're gonna sterilize you and force medicate you and put you in a prison but hey we
[2:15:15.600 --> 2:15:19.440]  let you survive you know you're welcome we're letting you survive we're letting you live it's
[2:15:19.440 --> 2:15:24.080]  our planet now we could just be done with you and wipe you all out look at the georgia guide stones
[2:15:24.080 --> 2:15:27.200]  and that's because they know they tell us they're gonna kill us outright we'll fight back so it's
[2:15:27.200 --> 2:15:31.200]  just like you're gonna drink poop water and you're gonna eat bugs it's i mean i mean the washington
[2:15:31.200 --> 2:15:35.840]  post both pages we make cows have bags up their butts because they're evil and you're evil too

[2:18:31.200 --> 2:18:37.200]  it happened hell she bragged back on january 8 that it took place then and is saying that she honors
[2:18:37.200 --> 2:18:41.440]  milley and that he's this courageous person so we're all these other democrats so this is the
[2:18:41.440 --> 2:18:46.000]  permanent deep state coup that's been in control for a long time now coming out of the shadows
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:50.800]  publicly remember these people literally hate you and your family now they're injecting you with
[2:18:50.800 --> 2:19:01.600]  poison soft kill injections wake up america or be destroyed on september ninth 2021 the puppet
[2:19:01.600 --> 2:19:08.560]  president joe biden publicly declared war against america he then announced dictatorial powers
[2:19:08.560 --> 2:19:15.200]  unto himself and announced forced inoculations against the american people he is a puppet of
[2:19:15.200 --> 2:19:20.480]  the united nations and the rockefeller combatant corporations that put him in power and he is making
[2:19:20.480 --> 2:19:25.600]  a very serious move against the american people but the attack he's launched is being launched
[2:19:25.600 --> 2:19:30.880]  against every other western country on the planet by these corporations that have already enslaved
[2:19:30.880 --> 2:19:36.080]  the third world what they're doing is illegal on its face violates our federal and state laws
[2:19:36.080 --> 2:19:41.360]  and the janiva convention as well as the nuremberg code it's very very simple we have to decide
[2:19:41.360 --> 2:19:45.840]  whether we're going to surrender to this globalist corporate takeover whether we're going to stand up
[2:19:45.840 --> 2:19:51.120]  with our birthright and say no and then prosecute these criminals for their crimes against humanity
[2:19:51.120 --> 2:19:54.560]  so other criminals in the future don't dare try it the choice is up to us
[2:19:54.560 --> 2:20:11.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:18.560 --> 2:20:22.240]  all right we're gonna get to puppet biden at the un this morning
[2:20:22.240 --> 2:20:27.120]  but first let's play him talking about the new world order and saying china owns us
[2:20:27.840 --> 2:20:36.560]  one more time here it is we in particularly you your class has an incredible window of opportunity
[2:20:37.440 --> 2:20:43.280]  to lead in shaping a new world order for the 21st century
[2:20:43.280 --> 2:20:50.320]  the affirmative task we have now is is to actually
[2:20:51.680 --> 2:21:01.680]  create a new world order i do know a lot about foreign policy as much as anybody in this room
[2:21:01.680 --> 2:21:09.280]  including if you're henry kissinger who i love folks we have mortgaged our foreign policy
[2:21:09.280 --> 2:21:15.040]  everyone's out there going oh my god how and god's name you know the chinese came here and
[2:21:15.040 --> 2:21:18.480]  they the president didn't get anything guess what they own us
[2:21:21.840 --> 2:21:28.240]  how i loved the new world order how i learned to love the new world order he had something
[2:21:28.240 --> 2:21:37.120]  he wrote in the new york times april 23rd 1992 why not breathe life into the un charter well they've
[2:21:37.120 --> 2:21:41.280]  all gone and pledged allegiance to it oh and shroyer's riding shotgun with me he's not hosting
[2:21:41.280 --> 2:21:46.320]  a war room today at 3 p.m. Paris the smith is he hosted uh the washington journal this morning
[2:21:46.320 --> 2:21:51.120]  eight a.m. we're shaking stuff up here not because stuff stagnant we're just always shaking it up
[2:21:51.120 --> 2:21:56.080]  taking to the next level uh oh and when you add this to million everything else they're just
[2:21:56.080 --> 2:22:01.920]  and sarah silverman all of them they're just preparing us to be slaves it's here well and
[2:22:01.920 --> 2:22:07.440]  and when are we going to reach a threshold of americans that are just sick and tired of this
[2:22:08.000 --> 2:22:13.760]  and then what does the national debate become next and i think that our election system has
[2:22:13.760 --> 2:22:19.760]  kind of been the um the focal point of this or the nucleus of this because we feel like we've
[2:22:19.760 --> 2:22:24.800]  already reached that threshold and build back better we passed a long time ago is the un
[2:22:24.800 --> 2:22:29.680]  slogan for tearing everything down and bringing in and so there where is governor the scientist
[2:22:29.680 --> 2:22:35.760]  where is governor abed uh where is rand paul i mean this is all world government out in the open
[2:22:35.760 --> 2:22:40.080]  they admitted the newspaper and then none of them challenge it none of them challenge a corporate
[2:22:40.080 --> 2:22:45.760]  authoritarian world government they'll challenge the policies but never rally americans against
[2:22:45.760 --> 2:22:50.560]  the globalism and that's why we're failing that's why that's why every day i hammer it's not biden's
[2:22:50.560 --> 2:22:54.560]  the reason we're not slaves it's that we've let him do this this is out and it's all about oh my
[2:22:54.560 --> 2:22:58.800]  crackhead's son can sell paintings for million dollars their payoffs i can have you know a hundred

[2:23:16.560 --> 2:23:21.040]  into a position of leadership that was rallying against globalism was donald trump and what did
[2:23:21.040 --> 2:23:26.880]  we see 50 000 people per rally 50 000 people and we've seen bolsynaro who's even better than trump
[2:23:26.880 --> 2:23:32.160]  stabbed hey uh he can't go to a restaurant which is finding each piece on the side of the road

[2:26:35.360 --> 2:26:40.320]  a coalition of representatives it should be democrats and republicans that want americans
[2:26:40.320 --> 2:26:44.800]  to be sovereign and live in a free nation that shouldn't be a republican thing or a one party
[2:26:44.800 --> 2:26:49.120]  thing or one individual thing what where is anybody that wants to pick up the energy in the
[2:26:49.120 --> 2:26:54.640]  steam where truck left off having 50 000 people at a rally rallying against the globe because he
[2:26:54.640 --> 2:26:59.520]  wasn't a globalist for all his faults but they are all put in power bought and paid for and picked
[2:26:59.520 --> 2:27:04.640]  because they write op-eds the new york times 30 years ago saying i want to get rid of america

[2:28:56.880 --> 2:29:02.160]  about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity this will be the
[2:29:02.160 --> 2:29:07.600]  most important message you'll hear this year here's why we now have a small number of solar
[2:29:07.600 --> 2:29:13.440]  generators back in stock these emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when
[2:29:13.440 --> 2:29:19.840]  you need it most and unlike gas generators solar generators run quietly emit no dangerous fumes
[2:29:19.840 --> 2:29:25.280]  and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun whether it's wildfires dangerous
[2:29:25.280 --> 2:29:30.080]  whether power grid issues or just getting off the grid you'll never have to suffer through
[2:29:30.080 --> 2:29:36.160]  painful power outages again even better all this week radio listeners get over seven hundred dollars
[2:29:36.160 --> 2:29:42.320]  in free off-the-grid bonuses to go to my solar backup dot com to learn more and check availability
[2:29:42.320 --> 2:29:48.000]  that's my solar backup dot com look for the free report crisis cooling how to make absolutely sure
[2:29:48.000 --> 2:29:54.720]  your meat milk and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage yours free at my solar backup
[2:29:54.720 --> 2:30:04.160]  dot com globalist general milley has revealed to the world that the united states is not a free
[2:30:04.160 --> 2:30:09.840]  republic but it's run by a permanent state behind network bureaucracy the big takeaway here is is that
[2:30:09.840 --> 2:30:16.400]  he didn't act alone he felt that he was safe to talk on an overseas phone line system that he knew
[2:30:16.400 --> 2:30:21.760]  was being watched by not just our government the five eyes the russians and the chinese he wanted
[2:30:21.760 --> 2:30:26.800]  the world to know that he was proud of what he was doing because he was backed by the deep state
[2:30:26.800 --> 2:30:31.520]  this permanent bureaucracy sees america as its enemy it sees the american people as its enemy
[2:30:31.520 --> 2:30:37.600]  it sees prosperity as its enemy and it conspired with the communist chinese to threaten them basically
[2:30:37.600 --> 2:30:43.680]  and say trump may nuke you but if he tries we'll call and say we're attacking you so you can respond
[2:30:43.680 --> 2:30:49.280]  first that's beyond treason but it shows the type of anti-american sycophants living in their own
[2:30:49.280 --> 2:30:54.480]  vetted bubble they try to get away with this milley and all of his accomplices need to go to prison
[2:30:54.480 --> 2:31:02.080]  now for life you know it's crazy to get to this point it's very bittersweet everything we've talked
[2:31:02.080 --> 2:31:06.160]  about has happened just like we said it would and now we have a lot of credibility but i don't care
[2:31:06.160 --> 2:31:10.480]  about that i care about beating the new world order and it's because we have so much credibility
[2:31:10.480 --> 2:31:14.880]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer and i don't have time to tell you all the stuff
[2:31:14.880 --> 2:31:19.360]  they're doing to us for a lot of reasons i can't tell you what's going on but let's just say this

[2:32:07.680 --> 2:32:11.520]  take away speech they then enslave the population and then they finally start exterminating the
[2:32:11.520 --> 2:32:17.040]  population and america the entire world is going down the tubes because the un global's directed

[2:33:50.960 --> 2:33:55.200]  too big for their bridges so now he's arresting some of their people and taking over their companies
[2:33:55.200 --> 2:33:59.200]  it just shows how they're busy getting rid of due process in america and hin pecking us because

[2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:45.920]  and the support of mal socialist vision and that's what they've done here so so let's let's let's
[2:34:45.920 --> 2:34:50.240]  hear i mean to me it's even surreal i knew this was all coming but you talk about them getting
[2:34:50.240 --> 2:34:55.360]  us used to it here is the puppet that stole the election has no support telling us all these lies
[2:34:55.360 --> 2:35:02.480]  and pushing us into 2030 in our face at the un let's just play it and listen to it ladies and
[2:35:02.480 --> 2:35:09.840]  gentlemen this is the clear and urgent choice that we face here at the dawning of what must be a
[2:35:09.840 --> 2:35:16.720]  decisive decade for our world a decade that will quite literally determine our futures
[2:35:17.920 --> 2:35:24.960]  as a global community we're challenged by urgent and looming crises wherein lie enormous opportunities
[2:35:24.960 --> 2:35:32.720]  if if we can summon the will and resolve to seize these opportunities will we work together
[2:35:32.720 --> 2:35:40.000]  to save lives defeat COVID-19 everywhere and take the necessary steps to prepare ourselves
[2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:46.640]  for the next pandemic for there will be another one or will we fail to harness the tools at our
[2:35:46.640 --> 2:35:53.200]  disposal as the more virulent and dangerous variants take hold will we meet the threat
[2:35:53.920 --> 2:35:58.480]  of challenging climate the challenging climate we're all feeling all sorry just stop it i have
[2:35:58.480 --> 2:36:04.240]  to say something i want you to just pack it up 10 seconds remember 15 days to flatten the curve
[2:36:04.240 --> 2:36:10.320]  two months wear a mask 18 months well it's permanent get used to it but take the vaccine you don't
[2:36:10.320 --> 2:36:13.760]  have to wear a mask okay you took the vaccine you got to wear a mask okay just take the vaccine you
[2:36:13.760 --> 2:36:18.160]  want to be tested to go to college every day or work oh now even if you have the shots you got to
[2:36:18.160 --> 2:36:23.440]  take more shots johnson johnson says every two months the others say the same thing now oh and
[2:36:23.440 --> 2:36:30.000]  uh you still got to be tested even if you have the shots i mean it's a trap it's a scam it's like
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:33.840]  you you're like a pizza delivery guy you go to somebody's door and they go step in here for me
[2:36:33.840 --> 2:36:37.360]  and they hit you in the back of the head with a club and you wake up and you're chained up and
[2:36:37.360 --> 2:36:41.280]  somehow you know you get out of it and they go come back i won't hit you in the head with a club
[2:36:41.280 --> 2:36:44.960]  again and you come back and they hit you again and next you're tied down to a table and they're
[2:36:44.960 --> 2:36:50.160]  getting ready to eat you i mean it's just ridiculous see the public is so liming like
[2:36:50.160 --> 2:36:54.000]  and they're gonna trance they can't believe they're being abused they can't believe they're
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:37:00.240]  being attacked oh and well it's pretty there's an easy way to illustrate the control the manipulation
[2:37:00.240 --> 2:37:04.320]  the the slavery that biden is proposing here you can just ask a simple question alex just
[2:37:04.320 --> 2:37:10.960]  you know humor me here uh alex do you want to live in fear of a virus no okay well sorry you
[2:37:10.960 --> 2:37:15.440]  have no choice actually you're gonna have to live in fear do you want to live in fear that the
[2:37:15.440 --> 2:37:20.240]  weather is going to kill everybody uh no oh sorry well you have no choice so you're gonna have to
[2:37:20.240 --> 2:37:24.640]  live in fear the rest of your life and uh well if you don't want to live in that fear we're going
[2:37:24.640 --> 2:37:30.320]  to give you a nice little cell to live in and it'll be about four by four and you can be nice
[2:37:30.320 --> 2:37:34.160]  and safe in there because you're a danger to the world now we've declared you a threat to the world
[2:37:34.160 --> 2:37:38.560]  because you're not afraid of a virus and you're not afraid of the weather and so well now you're
[2:37:38.560 --> 2:37:45.360]  just a prisoner you see well that's it and all they do is tell us that just do what we say and
[2:37:45.360 --> 2:37:49.680]  we'll go back to normal so people go okay i'll give my kids shots to play sports okay i'll take it
[2:37:49.680 --> 2:37:53.680]  and you have a heart attack and you go well and then suddenly nobody will talk to you i mean
[2:37:53.680 --> 2:37:58.240]  ladies and gentlemen how do they used to get every culture to commit human sacrifice why would they
[2:37:58.240 --> 2:38:02.960]  do that is an exercise of power and the same type of cults are in control and are literally having
[2:38:02.960 --> 2:38:07.040]  a sacrifice our children it's a psychology that most people can't understand i know we got to
[2:38:07.040 --> 2:38:12.400]  get back to biden but alex the world elite look at the planet as theirs they don't want you to take
[2:38:12.400 --> 2:38:18.720]  their oxygen their water their food their land it's theirs that's what prince philip said and they
[2:38:18.720 --> 2:38:22.880]  love him he said they're a bunch of useful cedars gonna be cold and you're now in the culling process
[2:38:22.880 --> 2:38:27.280]  and our audience is the best hope we've got to fight this and stop it and that's why you're so
[2:38:27.280 --> 2:38:33.280]  important back to the uh reanimated corpse puppet they put into power here it is as a more virulent
[2:38:33.280 --> 2:38:40.240]  and dangerous variance take hold well we meet the threat of challenging it as the more virulent
[2:38:40.240 --> 2:38:45.680]  and deadly versions take hold it takes hold see they're taking hold that's it's so oh you took
[2:38:45.680 --> 2:38:50.560]  the shop and now it's worse i mean come on people you don't you don't go out of somebody fix your
[2:38:50.560 --> 2:38:55.360]  car because you had a pop tire and then now your engine blows up when you leave you take it back
[2:38:55.360 --> 2:38:59.440]  and now if something else breaks they're breaking the equipment on the car to keep you under their
[2:38:59.440 --> 2:39:06.080]  control go back to this piece of filth just go back to him well we meet the threat of challenging
[2:39:06.080 --> 2:39:12.400]  climate the challenging climate we're all feeling already ravaging every part of our world with
[2:39:12.400 --> 2:39:19.600]  extreme weather or will we suffer the merciless march of ever worsening droughts and floods
[2:39:20.320 --> 2:39:26.560]  more intense fires and hurricanes longer heat waves and rising sea none of that's true
[2:39:26.560 --> 2:39:31.200]  well it was again i'm sorry back it up it's in the stack of articles over this morning
[2:39:31.200 --> 2:39:37.280]  the guys pull it up biden's creating a new agency a department in an agency to fight
[2:39:37.280 --> 2:39:42.080]  the warm weather and to teach people how to survive in the growing heat and statistically
[2:39:42.080 --> 2:39:46.960]  we're not getting hotter it's all a lie but they just doesn't matter i mean i remember in the 1980s
[2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:53.200]  in two days when i was in middle school and stuff when it was 115 degrees in dallas it ain't been
[2:39:53.200 --> 2:39:59.200]  115 since then it's bs ladies and gentlemen yeah we just had the record cold and snowfall here in
[2:39:59.200 --> 2:40:04.800]  austin he might as well be giving a speech warning you that martians are invading from mars and the
[2:40:04.800 --> 2:40:08.080]  plutonium well the world ends in 2030 that's because they plan to kill everybody by then
[2:40:08.800 --> 2:40:13.440]  you you understand those they say by 2030 they want to reduce the majority of the population
[2:40:13.440 --> 2:40:17.680]  and they're getting started with a with a weak virus and it's going to get stronger
[2:40:17.680 --> 2:40:21.200]  he heard more deadly variants they're going to take hold they're going to take hold in you
[2:40:21.200 --> 2:40:25.440]  they're going to kill you they made it they're going to release it that's why he said decisive
[2:40:25.440 --> 2:40:29.280]  decade because this is the decade where the globalists make their global calling of the
[2:40:29.280 --> 2:40:34.640]  population but there'd be just as much reality if he was up there telling you plutonians were coming
[2:40:34.640 --> 2:40:40.480]  and eight hunted monsters from saturn's eighth moon are coming to eat you there'd be just much
[2:40:40.480 --> 2:40:44.400]  reality in that as there isn't what he's just said and and and here's the key to all this
[2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:51.360]  what we need to do is i guarantee you they've got cures they've got real vaccines for what
[2:40:51.360 --> 2:40:57.520]  they released and so any people inside the wuhan lab inside the chapel hill labs we need a long
[2:40:57.520 --> 2:41:03.360]  term infiltration program just like um just like dr boil did to get into that special
[2:41:03.360 --> 2:41:07.280]  harvard phd they give one a year he got the kissinger phd about world government slaving
[2:41:07.280 --> 2:41:10.240]  everybody how the planners have set up real government tell everybody that's how he knows
[2:41:10.240 --> 2:41:14.800]  about it he has that phd on record that's why was the head un you know prosecutor and the rest of
[2:41:14.800 --> 2:41:19.120]  it wrote the us laws on bio weapons and chemical weapons and but he spent you know a lot of time
[2:41:19.120 --> 2:41:24.640]  to be the smartest guy the highest sense class to get into that and the other elite schools
[2:41:24.640 --> 2:41:28.480]  but all we need is people whether you live on a golf course next to some of these people are
[2:41:28.480 --> 2:41:33.200]  anywhere to the front this is a war you're gonna have to be an intelligence operative for god
[2:41:33.200 --> 2:41:36.720]  and you're gonna have to infiltrate and find out what's going on don't break the law or anything but
[2:41:36.720 --> 2:41:41.840]  they've all got real vaccines they've all got real all this stuff that's what's gonna be obvious
[2:41:41.840 --> 2:41:45.840]  is when they're killing i mean folks they're gonna kill everybody i mean most people listening
[2:41:45.840 --> 2:41:49.440]  are gonna be dead in like five ten years of this continues i mean i'm not trying to scare you i'm
[2:41:49.440 --> 2:41:53.760]  just saying i mean this is real they're coming to kill everybody figured it out yet well who do
[2:41:53.760 --> 2:42:00.160]  you think you're dealing with that make viruses in a lab that's run by the chinese military 100
[2:42:00.160 --> 2:42:04.240]  times worse than this one and they and they intentionally do spillover research it's all
[2:42:04.240 --> 2:42:08.160]  in the document so that they can get an animal virus transmittable to humans they do gain a
[2:42:08.160 --> 2:42:14.240]  function research so that it's more cut it's more communicable who does that who does that alex
[2:42:14.240 --> 2:42:19.280]  do you have any desire to do that well it's it's illegal and then he lied to congress and you
[2:42:19.280 --> 2:42:24.960]  know he doesn't look so fouchy looks like he's a deflated uh little turnip now he doesn't look
[2:42:24.960 --> 2:42:29.040]  so arrogant now does he own but see here here's the thing alex the whole thing is a false flag
[2:42:29.040 --> 2:42:32.800]  because what they're gonna do is i mean because they always like to show their hand i think maybe
[2:42:32.800 --> 2:42:36.720]  biden's being serious i guess they are they are going to release a new dangerous variant what do
[2:42:36.720 --> 2:42:42.320]  you think delta is they released it but i'm saying they sprayed it on texas and then but if they
[2:42:42.320 --> 2:42:46.320]  really release something that's like you know 50 percent you're gonna die if you get it then they'll
[2:42:46.320 --> 2:42:50.560]  just blame all the unvaccinated and that'll be the excuse to mop us all up look it's a thousand
[2:42:50.560 --> 2:42:54.560]  data points that tell me this they hit florida and texas four months ago with a bio weapon
[2:42:54.560 --> 2:43:02.480]  i'm uh 59 years old in good health i'm not working in the front line
[2:43:03.280 --> 2:43:11.440]  so at my time it's not recommended to get vaccinated that was the current ceo of fizer
[2:43:12.160 --> 2:43:19.760]  just a few months ago on national tv interview saying oh he doesn't need to take the so-called
[2:43:19.760 --> 2:43:25.360]  m r and a vaccine that's really achieved therapy he said you know he's 57 years old he's healthy
[2:43:25.360 --> 2:43:30.160]  he doesn't need to get that risk people but that's not what his pr firms that have bought off
[2:43:30.800 --> 2:43:35.360]  the politicians over a hundred countries say they say you've got to take a dab a job or leave
[2:43:35.360 --> 2:43:40.880]  your house or get on a plane or a train or even get outside your home for one hour a day if you
[2:43:40.880 --> 2:43:46.400]  live in australia so remember the white house this exempt congress and their staff are exempt
[2:43:46.400 --> 2:43:50.720]  the postal service is exempt all these big corporate heads are exempt they're not taking
[2:43:50.720 --> 2:43:58.240]  their poison vaccine they're pushing it on you wake up folks wake up when bob woodward's new book
[2:43:58.240 --> 2:44:03.360]  came out alleging that general milley had called the head of the chinese military and said trump
[2:44:03.360 --> 2:44:08.160]  might nuke you you tried to overthrow the u.s government but basically i'm protecting you and
[2:44:08.160 --> 2:44:13.120]  i'll warn you if we launch an attack which was the greatest reason us history that has ever been
[2:44:13.120 --> 2:44:17.360]  committed people said oh alex it must not be true and i might wait bob woodward's former naval
[2:44:17.360 --> 2:44:22.080]  intelligence he's a big insider globalist he wouldn't have put this out unless they wanted
[2:44:22.080 --> 2:44:27.200]  to put it out say that billy was a hero to set the precedent you can have a permanent bureaucracy
[2:44:27.200 --> 2:44:31.760]  stay behind network deep state basically that has its own bureaucratic coup over america that's
[2:44:31.760 --> 2:44:36.320]  what he put by any so incredibly weak is to undermine the idea of the presidency well people
[2:44:36.320 --> 2:44:41.200]  said i was making it up with bob woodward's line well now milley admits he did it you see i didn't
[2:44:41.200 --> 2:44:46.480]  need to trust bob woodward i remember polosa on january 8th ragging that she'd gotten a call for
[2:44:46.480 --> 2:44:50.560]  milley that he'd take control of the nukes so this treason was hiding in plain view back then
[2:44:50.560 --> 2:44:55.120]  and we covered it see i have a memory folks i remember all this stuff that's why i know it's true
[2:44:55.120 --> 2:45:06.480]  and what's false as men age they often experience a slowdown in vitality energy and overall wellness

[2:49:47.920 --> 2:49:54.960]  joins us we already had one of his amazing whistleblowers jody o'Malley from hhs an msm rn who was
[2:49:54.960 --> 2:50:00.800]  over management and and and secretly recorded people admitting a vaccine is causing a large
[2:50:00.800 --> 2:50:06.000]  portion of the illnesses and even deaths and joining us to talk about this is james oakief
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:10.880]  i want to show you're riding shotgun uh james and others is part one tell us about it people that
[2:50:10.880 --> 2:50:14.960]  haven't seen everybody should share it right now he got censored off the web last night
[2:50:14.960 --> 2:50:19.280]  which is just incredible and and then part two give us an idea what's coming james thanks for
[2:50:19.280 --> 2:50:27.200]  joining us well thank you alex um yeah i mean this this video is uh blown up everywhere um you had
[2:50:27.200 --> 2:50:34.000]  jody on whistleblower it's part one this is a series of videotapes exposing what people inside
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  the government and pharmaceutical companies are saying what the vaccine so what you saw there was
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:44.320]  a federal employee you heard early on the program uh the hospital has responded hhs hospitals now
[2:50:44.320 --> 2:50:50.800]  given a response alex they say they're investigating what jody has has reported and again jody exposing
[2:50:50.800 --> 2:50:57.120]  doctors saying the vaccine is full of in their words shit and also um uh saying that myocarditis
[2:50:57.120 --> 2:51:01.280]  and heart issues were not reported to the cdc the cdc mandates that those things are reported
[2:51:01.280 --> 2:51:07.520]  uh and jody recorded her colleagues saying they weren't reported so there's a lot of people alex
[2:51:07.520 --> 2:51:11.760]  like jody out there thousands of people that are in her position but she was the first one to
[2:51:11.760 --> 2:51:17.120]  effectively do this no one's ever done what she's done before so we have the next installment
[2:51:17.120 --> 2:51:24.480]  tomorrow hospital alex has not denied what jody has said so in other words the tapes are true
[2:51:24.480 --> 2:51:32.080]  and because they're true instagram took it down facebook took it down it's still up on youtube
[2:51:32.080 --> 2:51:37.680]  it's it's currently trending on twitter even though i'm banned on twitter this is an extraordinary
[2:51:37.680 --> 2:51:43.040]  series of events uh it's things typically go this way when you get the damning footage because it's
[2:51:43.040 --> 2:51:48.080]  undeniable so well we need everybody to push this to the top of twitter so what is the hashtag
[2:51:48.080 --> 2:51:51.920]  or the term that's trending so we can get our audience to retweet it right now you're not on
[2:51:51.920 --> 2:51:56.960]  twitter i'm on twitter oh it's not there but they're there for all of us so listeners go get this
[2:51:56.960 --> 2:52:01.600]  let's make it number one and save some lives so that more whistleblowers have the courage to come
[2:52:01.600 --> 2:52:08.640]  forward uh what's the term we should all search yeah it's uh eric what's the covid vax exposes
[2:52:08.640 --> 2:52:14.880]  the current hashtag hashtag covid vax exposed and the video is populating everywhere you can go on
[2:52:14.880 --> 2:52:19.040]  my telegram and like you and i talked about distribution by proxy all you have to do is
[2:52:19.040 --> 2:52:23.200]  is embed the video everyone's doing it they can't get around the censorship i'm sorry the
[2:52:23.200 --> 2:52:28.960]  censorship is not stopping us we're getting around the censorship um and um you know and the great
[2:52:28.960 --> 2:52:33.360]  thing again is that we've elicited a response from the hospital and they have not denied what we've
[2:52:33.360 --> 2:52:39.440]  reported so a lot of people inspired by jody's example there it is on twitter uh if you look
[2:52:39.440 --> 2:52:44.400]  at those videos people are embedding them everywhere it's distribution by proxy just like we talked
[2:52:44.400 --> 2:52:49.680]  about absolutely and again they wouldn't be trying to censor it if it wasn't exposing their narrative
[2:52:49.680 --> 2:52:53.600]  i know you're not even anti-vaccine when they're good clean approved vaccines but this is even a
[2:52:53.600 --> 2:52:58.720]  vaccine the wheels are coming off and as more whistleblowers come forward i don't see how they're
[2:52:58.720 --> 2:53:02.800]  going to be able to cover this up that the that this so-called shot is causing heart attacks is
[2:53:02.800 --> 2:53:07.680]  causing covid-like symptoms yeah i mean i don't i don't take a position on the vaccine i'm just
[2:53:07.680 --> 2:53:12.640]  giving the people who are in the meadow in the government a platform to talk about it i mean
[2:53:12.640 --> 2:53:17.760]  this is not pretend this is a real human being and she's willing to give up her career her
[2:53:17.760 --> 2:53:24.160]  livelihood she saw her friend die and she cried about it so i'm giving people an opportunity
[2:53:24.160 --> 2:53:30.720]  to speak tomorrow um you're going to hear from someone uh inside of another government uh agency
[2:53:31.440 --> 2:53:36.240]  talking about this and saying some pretty if i i'm not going to tell you what he said yet
[2:53:36.240 --> 2:53:40.720]  because we're still producing it but if i told you alex it would evoke audible gasps from you
[2:53:40.720 --> 2:53:46.240]  it's that shocking so i don't think there's anything they can do to stop project veritas at this point
[2:53:46.240 --> 2:53:49.280]  there's nothing that they can do to stop us because they were to ban me at this point people would
[2:53:49.280 --> 2:53:54.400]  just be more interested in what is coming out so what i would encourage people to do is continue
[2:53:54.400 --> 2:54:00.560]  to blow up our our tip line it's veritas tips and proton mail dot com download the customer on telegram
[2:54:00.560 --> 2:54:07.120]  page and upload them everywhere uh i don't think they want to take it off youtube now because it's
[2:54:07.120 --> 2:54:12.720]  just going to help the story they have to be very careful alex about uh uh making this an
[2:54:12.720 --> 2:54:18.240]  international story by like removing me wholesale from youtube and instagram so they're they're they're
[2:54:18.240 --> 2:54:24.000]  walking that line censoring it a little bit but not too much well i gotta tell you uh this is the
[2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:28.000]  achilles heel of this whole thing it's going to be whistleblowers people inside and as you said
[2:54:28.000 --> 2:54:34.160]  her friend was a nurse from the video i've seen and she died at the shot i mean the question is how
[2:54:34.160 --> 2:54:38.640]  far will you go to submit to this well her friend died and then she has the doctors and nurses for
[2:54:38.640 --> 2:54:42.480]  those that haven't seen the video admitting they know this is going on and i've talked to medical
[2:54:42.480 --> 2:54:46.320]  doctors in austin ought to put you in touch with them they're leaving a husband and wife the hospital
[2:54:46.320 --> 2:54:51.760]  they work at there uh because they're telling him to cover up uh what's going on so i'll have to get
[2:54:51.760 --> 2:54:55.680]  you in contact with them they're telling him you're not going to tell people it's this vaccine i mean
[2:54:55.680 --> 2:55:00.480]  i think this house of cards is coming down as you know this weekend the fda voted 16 to 2 to not give
[2:55:00.480 --> 2:55:05.120]  booster shots and do not give to kids and and fouchy said we don't care we're going ahead with it i
[2:55:05.120 --> 2:55:11.760]  mean this is crazy well and and the fact that they're not reporting things that they're supposed
[2:55:11.760 --> 2:55:16.880]  to report that was one of the statements that struck me dr kanzala's the er doctor at the hhs clinic
[2:55:16.880 --> 2:55:21.360]  saying um they're covering it under the the rug the mat they're not reporting it even though they're
[2:55:21.360 --> 2:55:25.040]  supposed to we've heard a lot of messages from people why aren't they reporting these issues
[2:55:25.040 --> 2:55:29.920]  and again i'm not taking a position on the on the the vaccine i actually don't have one
[2:55:29.920 --> 2:55:36.640]  my job is to tell people the truth and sometimes the truth works both ways it's not just one sighted
[2:55:36.640 --> 2:55:40.800]  there may be problems here that people have a right to know about uh there may be people
[2:55:40.800 --> 2:55:44.880]  in the pharmaceutical companies alex that know things that they want to keep secret from the
[2:55:44.880 --> 2:55:49.360]  public and the public needs to know this stuff exactly a free country has transparency ellen's
[2:55:49.360 --> 2:55:54.720]  got a quick question for you to go james how many of the whistleblowers that came to you attempted
[2:55:54.720 --> 2:56:02.000]  to go to other media outlets first and got rejected with this big story i mean there there's no
[2:56:02.000 --> 2:56:06.960]  paradigm for them to release this story on any of the cable networks or any anywhere i mean who
[2:56:06.960 --> 2:56:12.640]  and look at what's happened to us we're getting banned off it's being taken off instagram so yeah
[2:56:12.640 --> 2:56:16.080]  they have one narrative they're not journalists they just report lies they won't even talk to
[2:56:16.080 --> 2:56:21.120]  people like her so very bad and info wars are people that report this are the only hope for
[2:56:21.120 --> 2:56:26.480]  this information to get out yeah there's no place for people to go and this is what i've
[2:56:26.480 --> 2:56:31.040]  been saying for a long time with you guys there's there's simply no other place for people to go
[2:56:31.040 --> 2:56:36.320]  the only thing that these people fear is we the people they don't fear the the congress they don't
[2:56:36.320 --> 2:56:43.520]  fear anything the only fear are the barbarians at the gates the population effectively pushing back
[2:56:44.080 --> 2:56:48.640]  my friend laura logan likes to say something which sounds pretty crazy but i believe it's true
[2:56:48.640 --> 2:56:53.680]  is she she effectively says that we're as a country we're at the gates of auschwitz and
[2:56:53.680 --> 2:56:58.640]  the coup has already happened we're we're sort of being pushed into this orwellian or apocalyptic
[2:56:58.640 --> 2:57:03.120]  dystopia and the only thing that's gonna stop us from from entering those gates is we the people
[2:57:03.120 --> 2:57:08.080]  and people like jody who's giving up her livelihood there's thousands more like her alex so stay
[2:57:08.080 --> 2:57:11.360]  tuned for tomorrow i can't tell you exactly what it is it's going to be huge it's going to be
[2:57:11.360 --> 2:57:16.320]  sensational it's going to get people to think in a way they've never thought before about what's
[2:57:16.320 --> 2:57:20.720]  going on in this country that's right we will succeed we don't have a choice project veritas.com
[2:57:20.720 --> 2:57:26.240]  we'll cover it tomorrow thanks james o' keith thank you all right we're gonna come back fourth hour
[2:57:26.240 --> 2:57:30.160]  paul joseph watson joins us but i want to put some bookends on this and i don't know if we have
[2:57:30.160 --> 2:57:33.760]  time to air it if not it's gonna air on the war room maybe i'll do a special report on it because
[2:57:33.760 --> 2:57:41.200]  they had a great idea uh uh some of the crew did showing trump's speech to the un against the new
[2:57:41.200 --> 2:57:48.400]  world order again juxtaposed with what biden's saying we've all heard about the pastor and his
[2:57:48.400 --> 2:57:54.320]  famous statement from inside a concentration camp in world war two that when they came for one group
[2:57:54.320 --> 2:57:58.400]  he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and then when they came for another group he wasn't
[2:57:58.400 --> 2:58:03.440]  part of that group so he didn't stand up and finally when they came for him there was nobody
[2:58:03.440 --> 2:58:07.600]  else to stand up well the global social credit score that china is looking at that's banning people
[2:58:07.600 --> 2:58:11.920]  to three hours of video games a week and if you criticize the government you can never buy or sell
[2:58:11.920 --> 2:58:16.480]  again well that's that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of covid
[2:58:17.200 --> 2:58:21.760]  vaccine passports they even admit it now they're saying it's going to be a carbon tax attached to
[2:58:21.760 --> 2:58:25.440]  it they're going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you can go and what you
[2:58:25.440 --> 2:58:31.440]  can do that's what the lockdowns are about you'll accept that you'll accept anything so again the
[2:58:31.440 --> 2:58:35.520]  left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending like they're part of the
[2:58:35.520 --> 2:58:39.680]  power structure but they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well we need to get back
[2:58:39.680 --> 2:58:44.240]  to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy
[2:58:44.240 --> 2:58:53.040]  run by the globalists there is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's
[2:58:53.040 --> 2:59:00.880]  ruling class not in communist china not in mexico not in the united states not anywhere is there a
[2:59:00.880 --> 2:59:06.960]  real study of the planet's ruling class and that's done by design the large central banks that
[2:59:06.960 --> 2:59:12.880]  basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look in to say the
[2:59:12.880 --> 2:59:17.120]  anglo-american establishment the founder of the bilberberg group the trilateral commission of the
[2:59:17.120 --> 2:59:23.040]  united nations the whole project of the ross shawls and the rockelfels until 10 years ago the media
[2:59:23.040 --> 2:59:28.400]  said the control corporate media of the bilberberg group didn't exist well now the bilberberg group
[2:59:28.400 --> 2:59:34.400]  is public in its former head show the steering committee is claus schwaab and he has set up the
[2:59:34.400 --> 2:59:39.360]  great reset at global government and if as a liberty movement worldwide we don't address the
[2:59:39.360 --> 2:59:44.400]  globalist head on about the fact that they are worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover we
[2:59:44.400 --> 3:00:01.360]  don't have a shot we do expose them we can beat them easily you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:01.360 --> 3:00:05.840]  all right i've been pretty wound up today and i was up till like one in the morning last night
[3:00:05.840 --> 3:00:09.920]  when i drove back to go to dc's and disinformation i drove yeah i just go ahead and shut it off
[3:00:09.920 --> 3:00:15.520]  the former takes a lot start over anyways i have been pretty hyped up pretty wound up
[3:00:16.480 --> 3:00:20.720]  here today and i got back from dc right in time for the show and i appreciate no one
[3:00:20.720 --> 3:00:26.480]  doing a great job but i'm gonna shoot some special reports today as well that deal with
[3:00:27.280 --> 3:00:31.040]  what trump said and did that was so revolutionary why pissed him off it was a great thing he did
[3:00:31.760 --> 3:00:37.200]  at the un calling out the new world order you know every year versus what biden's doing we
[3:00:37.200 --> 3:00:41.680]  need to remind america of that and reminder by this is a takeover more republicans need to do
[3:00:41.680 --> 3:00:45.440]  what trump's done that's why they don't do it though they know if you do what trump did and
[3:00:45.440 --> 3:00:50.560]  called out the attack on america they come after you on or you know so many people refuse to want
[3:00:50.560 --> 3:00:54.400]  to share info wars links or come on info wars as guests because they know it's the same thing
[3:00:54.400 --> 3:00:58.720]  oh i may be marked for censorship and i may be this i know you're briefly discussing that on the
[3:00:59.360 --> 3:01:04.480]  tim pool podcast yesterday which you know he's been through it too he had you on i guess it was
[3:01:04.480 --> 3:01:08.800]  like six months ago they censored that podcast he deleted some of it off of his youtube channel so
[3:01:08.800 --> 3:01:14.000]  he could stay up so i get it but that's fine you'll have nothing if you're afraid to share alex
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:18.640]  jones or you're afraid to go on info wars then you'll have nothing when it's all said and done so
[3:01:18.640 --> 3:01:23.040]  just enjoy riding off into the sunset because no one will support you when you get taken off but
[3:01:23.040 --> 3:01:27.440]  i don't think that's gonna happen alex i think even the weakest people out there in media that's
[3:01:27.440 --> 3:01:32.720]  still deep down love liberty love life want to be free and prosperous eventually they're
[3:01:32.720 --> 3:01:36.400]  going to turn it on and and that'll be when the threshold is crossed and i don't want to see a
[3:01:36.400 --> 3:01:41.200]  situation like we have in australia where i think a civil war is almost inevitable at the end like
[3:01:41.200 --> 3:01:46.240]  cop cars running people over the cops are won a war they are just and again that's what claus
[3:01:46.240 --> 3:01:52.960]  swab wants but people didn't know it's direct it's a plan it's by design and tomorrow we got tim pool
[3:01:52.960 --> 3:01:59.040]  on the show so look for a tim pool i don't do a lot of interviews but uh he's going to be with us
[3:01:59.040 --> 3:02:04.560]  tomorrow uh so that's going to be on 11 a.m to 2 p.m central the fourth hour we usually have a
[3:02:04.560 --> 3:02:10.720]  guest host and it's paul joseph watson on tuesday's tuesday is paul joseph watson of summit dot news
[3:02:10.720 --> 3:02:17.440]  time uh oh and you hosted uh american journal this morning i just i'm an idea we've all had to kind
[3:02:17.440 --> 3:02:23.040]  of host each other shows give it a little bit of a mix-up it's fun to do um and then i guess
[3:02:23.040 --> 3:02:28.000]  harris is hosting your show at 3 p.m today yeah and i will just say this tomorrow programming
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:33.200]  note for the war room i've been tracking this story and dr brian artist was so key in helping me
[3:02:33.200 --> 3:02:37.600]  understand it even better yesterday here on the alex joneshow but basically yet another example
[3:02:37.600 --> 3:02:41.840]  we're going to have the legal representation of a woman who was killed in a hospital she went in
[3:02:41.840 --> 3:02:47.520]  with covet she was treated like a prisoner multiple lawyers multiple uh court orders give her iver
[3:02:47.520 --> 3:02:52.560]  mekton release her they just refuse to do it now the woman's dead so we've been tracking i'm telling
[3:02:52.560 --> 3:02:57.200]  you alex but he dr brian artist is going to be back on the war with me next week it's so key
[3:02:57.200 --> 3:03:04.160]  he breaks it all down man it's everything we knew from being outside i've had a bunch of
[3:03:04.160 --> 3:03:08.080]  other medical doctors on there say the same thing and it's come out the protocol they give the
[3:03:08.080 --> 3:03:13.200]  covet protocol is a death sentence you get treated like a prisoner and this isn't even up for debate
[3:03:13.200 --> 3:03:17.200]  i mean even the people that's why you couldn't visit the families at old folks homes or hospitals
[3:03:17.200 --> 3:03:22.080]  because they want to be able to carry out the execution even the people that don't want to
[3:03:22.080 --> 3:03:27.600]  look at the covet reality in the face cannot argue where are the covet and think about this they
[3:03:27.600 --> 3:03:31.360]  killed the lady we had on earlier jody o'malley's friend who was a nurse there they wouldn't even
[3:03:31.360 --> 3:03:35.840]  give her iver mekton for steroids where do the covet deaths happen people they're not happening in
[3:03:35.840 --> 3:03:40.640]  the homeless camps they're not happening in these massive gatherings or protests or riots or rallies
[3:03:40.640 --> 3:03:45.440]  hospitals they're not happening at un meetings they're not happening at ball games they're happening
[3:03:45.440 --> 3:03:52.400]  at one place one place hospitals one place that's right oh and shroyer three p.m weekday central
[3:03:52.400 --> 3:03:56.080]  only way we get this message out and you get it now it's life and death we weren't hyping this we
[3:03:56.080 --> 3:04:00.800]  weren't lying they had a un world government plan the rockel fellers that set up the un to do it to
[3:04:00.800 --> 3:04:04.880]  literally kill us it's operation lockstep it's here they're going to release more deadly viruses
[3:04:04.880 --> 3:04:08.320]  soon and no vaccines going to help you it's actually going to breed them and create them
[3:04:08.320 --> 3:04:13.040]  so tell everybody to tune in now to paul joseph watson share the live links take his tweet when
[3:04:13.040 --> 3:04:18.720]  he puts it out promoting it retweet it info wars dot com forward slash show band out video and get

[3:05:07.120 --> 3:05:11.040]  take away speech they then enslave the population and then they finally start exterminating the
[3:05:11.040 --> 3:05:16.480]  population and america the entire world is going down the tubes because the un global's directed
[3:05:16.480 --> 3:05:21.040]  great reset that's why it's more important than ever that info war stay on the air and all of us

[3:06:08.880 --> 3:06:24.880]  transmitting worldwide from the summit.new studios in the united kingdom you are listening to paul
[3:06:24.880 --> 3:06:34.640]  joseph watson the summit news hour we're going to talk about the revolution the rebellion the
[3:06:34.640 --> 3:06:40.000]  revolt that's going on in australia finally people are tired of being told by their esteemed health
[3:06:40.000 --> 3:06:45.680]  authorities not to talk to their friends and neighbors they're tired of seeing joggers in
[3:06:45.680 --> 3:06:50.720]  parks arrested thrown to the ground as they have cardiac arrests for not wearing a mask
[3:06:52.160 --> 3:06:56.960]  they're sick to the back teeth of women old women being arrested for sitting on park benches
[3:06:56.960 --> 3:07:02.400]  they're sick to the back teeth of people being told to get off a beach because they're not wearing
[3:07:02.400 --> 3:07:06.960]  a mask while they're sat on the beach or they don't wear a mask from the walk to the beach to the
[3:07:06.960 --> 3:07:13.280]  bar because that's of course when we know covid is prone to strike most just like when you go into
[3:07:13.280 --> 3:07:20.000]  a restaurant the virus takes a break when you sit down at the table to have a drink but it's
[3:07:20.000 --> 3:07:27.280]  particularly potent in the 10-yard walk from the door of the restaurant to the table itself makes
[3:07:27.280 --> 3:07:31.760]  perfect sense i'll i'm sure you'll agree you're going to get into that shortly though because
[3:07:31.760 --> 3:07:37.600]  i did a report on australia a few hours ago let me know when we have that video ready
[3:07:37.600 --> 3:07:43.520]  but there was a big article that came out in the telegraph just about an hour ago the headline is
[3:07:43.520 --> 3:07:51.120]  wuhan scientists plan to release coronaviruses into bat caves 18 months before the outbreak and
[3:07:51.120 --> 3:07:57.440]  recall that the horseshoe bat that they claim this coronavirus originated in was not located
[3:07:57.440 --> 3:08:03.440]  in the wuhan wet market in fact the nearest bats which they claimed were naturally infected with
[3:08:03.440 --> 3:08:10.160]  this virus were 400 miles away what wasn't 400 miles away from the source of the infection was
[3:08:10.160 --> 3:08:15.440]  the wuhan institute of virology but remember we weren't allowed to talk about that or we'd be banned
[3:08:15.440 --> 3:08:22.160]  off social media and called dangerous conspiracy theorists for the best part of the year as peter
[3:08:22.160 --> 3:08:30.160]  dajak one of the uh prime engineers of this gain of function research in wuhan wrote emails to dr
[3:08:30.160 --> 3:08:36.480]  antony fouchy thanking him for not allowing that dangerous conspiracy theory to circulate as he
[3:08:36.480 --> 3:08:42.480]  was literally put over the board of facebook's fact-checking department on the coronavirus
[3:08:42.480 --> 3:08:49.520]  deciding what people can and can't say about it so wuhan scientists plan to release coronaviruses
[3:08:49.520 --> 3:08:56.560]  into cave bats 18 months before the outbreak remember the first confirmed case although
[3:08:56.560 --> 3:09:03.120]  they later covered this up of somebody falling sick from the coronavirus was a lab worker in
[3:09:03.120 --> 3:09:08.160]  the wuhan institute of virology just another coincidence wuhan scientists were planning to
[3:09:08.160 --> 3:09:14.320]  release enhanced airborne coronaviruses into chinese bat populations to inoculate them against
[3:09:14.320 --> 3:09:22.240]  diseases that could jump to humans leaped grant proposals dating from 2018 show and again remember
[3:09:22.800 --> 3:09:27.360]  these caves where the nearest bats came from that were the source of the coronavirus were told
[3:09:27.360 --> 3:09:34.320]  were 400 miles away from wuhan itself new documents show that just 18 months before the first covid-19
[3:09:34.320 --> 3:09:40.240]  cases appeared researchers had submitted plans to release skin penetrating nano particles
[3:09:40.240 --> 3:09:48.400]  particles containing novel chimeric spike proteins of bat coronaviruses into cave bats in yunnan china
[3:09:49.440 --> 3:09:56.320]  says they also plan to create chimeric viruses genetically enhanced to infect humans more easily
[3:09:56.320 --> 3:10:02.400]  remember this was a dangerous conspiracy theory just six months ago and requested 14 million
[3:10:02.400 --> 3:10:08.720]  dollars from darpa to fund the work and even darpa came back and said no this is ridiculous it's
[3:10:08.720 --> 3:10:14.160]  deadly it's dangerous we're not going to fund it even the deep state said it was too dangerous
[3:10:15.040 --> 3:10:19.040]  papers confirmed as genuine by a former member of the trump administration
[3:10:19.040 --> 3:10:23.600]  show they were hoping to introduce human specific cleavage sites to bat coronaviruses which
[3:10:23.600 --> 3:10:28.160]  would make it easier for the virus to enter human cells but again they were trying to
[3:10:28.160 --> 3:10:35.200]  prevent that by making it happen when covid-19 was first genetically sequenced scientists
[3:10:35.200 --> 3:10:40.080]  were puzzled about how the virus had evolved such a human specific adaptation at the cleavage site
[3:10:40.080 --> 3:10:45.600]  on the spike protein which is the reason it's so infectious documents released by drastic the
[3:10:45.600 --> 3:10:50.400]  web-based investigations team settled by scientists from across the world so this is from the esteemed
[3:10:50.400 --> 3:10:57.120]  scientists themselves then it goes on to say that the bid was submitted by British zoologist
[3:10:57.120 --> 3:11:05.200]  Peter Dajak of eco health alliance the organization that funded with dr. Anthony Fauci gain of function
[3:11:05.200 --> 3:11:12.160]  research on behalf of the u.s. government at the Wuhan Institute of virology and again as i said
[3:11:12.160 --> 3:11:19.520]  earlier Dajak was made kingmaker by facebook fact checkers to censor quote disinformation
[3:11:19.520 --> 3:11:27.680]  about the covid outbreak right at the start of the pandemic back in february 2020 then it goes on
[3:11:27.680 --> 3:11:34.640]  to include team members dr. Xi Zhengli the wiv researcher dubbed bat woman as well as you say
[3:11:34.640 --> 3:11:39.040]  u.s researchers from the university of north carolina and the united states geological survey
[3:11:39.040 --> 3:11:47.360]  national wildlife health center so again Dajak this guy again was intimately involved the same
[3:11:47.360 --> 3:11:54.880]  guy who back in february 2020 was writing gracious indebted emails to dr. Anthony Fauci
[3:11:54.880 --> 3:12:00.240]  thanking him for cutting off the narrative at the source that the Wuhan Institute of virology
[3:12:00.240 --> 3:12:05.520]  that he was funding had anything to do with the outbreak meanwhile they're literally infecting
[3:12:05.520 --> 3:12:11.520]  these bats with the coronavirus in these caves in Yunnan china or at least applying for the
[3:12:11.520 --> 3:12:19.920]  research permit to do so back in 2018 but even DARPA refused to fund the work saying quote it's
[3:12:19.920 --> 3:12:27.120]  clear the proposed project led by pete dajak can have put local communities at risk and one that
[3:12:27.120 --> 3:12:32.400]  the team had not properly considered the dangers of enhancing the virus gain of function research
[3:12:32.400 --> 3:12:37.920]  or releasing a vaccine by air grant document show the team also had some concerns about the
[3:12:37.920 --> 3:12:42.560]  vaccine program said they would quite conduct educational outreach so that there is a public
[3:12:42.560 --> 3:12:46.160]  understanding of what we're doing and why we're doing it particularly because of the practice of
[3:12:46.160 --> 3:12:52.640]  bat consumption in the region now again if you talked about any of this six months ago you were
[3:12:52.640 --> 3:13:00.000]  banned off of social media and they're still doing it to this day reclaim the net reports michigan
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:05.840]  candidate for governor garret soledano receives permanent ban from youtube why well he challenged
[3:13:05.840 --> 3:13:12.880]  governor whitmer's covid restrictions in michigan one too many times now he's permanently banned
[3:13:12.880 --> 3:13:18.240]  forever again more interference election interference by google the republican
[3:13:18.240 --> 3:13:23.920]  gubernatorial candidate michigan claims to have been permanently banned from youtube garret soledano
[3:13:23.920 --> 3:13:28.480]  an anti-lockdown activist who hopes to be the republican party's flag bearer for the michigan
[3:13:28.480 --> 3:13:34.240]  governor race next year was banned by youtube yesterday the notice from the google on platforms
[3:13:34.240 --> 3:13:38.320]  that his channel was suspended for severe or repeated violations of the community guidelines
[3:13:38.960 --> 3:13:44.720]  but did not specify exactly what they were he was challenging the lockdown restrictions in
[3:13:44.720 --> 3:13:50.800]  michigan that's why he was banned meanwhile facebook and instagram delete project veritas
[3:13:50.800 --> 3:13:56.800]  vaccine video for misinformation that could cause harm what was the misinformation it was a health
[3:13:56.800 --> 3:14:03.920]  and human services official talking about vaccine side effects literally one of their own scientists
[3:14:03.920 --> 3:14:10.160]  talk about it and it's gone it's banned it's zapped facebook and its subsidiary instagram
[3:14:10.160 --> 3:14:15.200]  have removed a new video by the way of course ok from project veritas were banned off of twitter
[3:14:15.200 --> 3:14:21.200]  many months ago they're being banned off all these other platforms now and instagram's removed the
[3:14:21.200 --> 3:14:27.600]  video from the undercover reporting operatives under its misinformation policy says we encourage
[3:14:27.600 --> 3:14:32.240]  free expression but we don't allow false information what was the false information well they didn't
[3:14:32.240 --> 3:14:37.040]  tell project veritas but the video in question featured a whistleblower from health and human
[3:14:37.040 --> 3:14:43.120]  services department registered nurse joe deo melly making allegations that the federal government
[3:14:43.120 --> 3:14:49.440]  were under reporting the side effects of the covet nineteen vaccines now the latest numbers
[3:14:50.000 --> 3:14:53.840]  show that they've been at least fifteen thousand deaths as a result of the vaccine
[3:14:54.400 --> 3:14:58.960]  of course that's an under reporting in and of itself but if you talk about that
[3:14:58.960 --> 3:15:06.320]  if you have a hhs registered nurse talk about it then you get banned off of facebook because again
[3:15:06.320 --> 3:15:13.040]  the people tasked with running the fact checks on facebook on instagram were the very same people
[3:15:13.040 --> 3:15:18.560]  running the wuhan institute virology cover-up from the very beginning the video O'Malley was
[3:15:18.560 --> 3:15:23.440]  discussing with another doctor an er doctor alleging that not all patients suffering from
[3:15:23.440 --> 3:15:29.600]  heart inflammation after taking the vaccine are being reported quote but now they the government
[3:15:29.600 --> 3:15:35.520]  are not going to blame the vaccine dr gonzalez said of a patient who had suspected myocarditis
[3:15:35.520 --> 3:15:41.600]  of course we've seen this in the uk with the teenagers suffering from heart complications
[3:15:41.600 --> 3:15:47.520]  way more so than being hospitalized from the virus from the covid virus itself and yet now
[3:15:47.520 --> 3:15:54.000]  we're rolling out jabs to kids as young as five years old the insanity continues summit dot news

[3:16:28.480 --> 3:16:34.240]  in a crazy covid culture me too but listen after all the research all the conflicting studies
[3:16:34.240 --> 3:16:39.680]  after all the squabbling there's one thing almost everyone agrees on it's that immune system health
[3:16:39.680 --> 3:16:44.960]  can literally be the difference between life and death you probably already believe that i certainly
[3:16:44.960 --> 3:16:50.640]  do so here's the thing i wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances
[3:16:50.640 --> 3:16:56.000]  actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support now you'll have to

[3:19:01.920 --> 3:19:07.280]  who are trying to destroy the middle class and in any form of upper mobility you've got to divide
[3:19:07.280 --> 3:19:12.640]  and conquer the public so they don't know they're being targeted and that's why the fortune 100 have
[3:19:12.640 --> 3:19:18.240]  wrapped themselves the name of lbgt and african-american rights and all the rest of it all over the
[3:19:18.240 --> 3:19:23.680]  world that's now their corporate face while they run slave camps in africa and in communist china
[3:19:23.680 --> 3:19:28.640]  and many other areas while they undermine our basic liberties here and spy on us through the big
[3:19:28.640 --> 3:19:34.240]  tech of the central banks and other zone so this is a criminal takeover and when you look at the new
[3:19:35.520 --> 3:19:41.520]  superclass it's the politicians it's the corporate media it's the police it's the bureaucrats it's
[3:19:41.520 --> 3:19:45.920]  members of congress and their staff and their families it's the white house hell it's postal
[3:19:45.920 --> 3:19:52.480]  workers who were all exempt from the poison shots but not the general public and everybody else
[3:19:52.480 --> 3:19:56.000]  through corporate rule so this is the true discrimination that's going on
[3:19:59.680 --> 3:20:02.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:02.320 --> 3:20:14.800]  you're listening to the summit dot news radio hour with paul joseph watson
[3:20:17.600 --> 3:20:24.720]  for many people have been asking of australians over the past six months where is their backbone
[3:20:24.720 --> 3:20:31.680]  what happened to the rugged individualist spirit of crocodile dundee where were the protests where
[3:20:31.680 --> 3:20:37.440]  was the mass revolt against this disastrous zero covid policy that the australian health
[3:20:37.440 --> 3:20:43.760]  authorities have been pursuing where is the revolt against this lockdown tyranny to the point where
[3:20:43.760 --> 3:20:50.880]  if you go three kilometers outside your home the police send a drone they track your license plate
[3:20:50.880 --> 3:20:56.160]  they issue fines they issue arrest at one point they were even talking about fitting people who
[3:20:56.160 --> 3:21:02.320]  were supposed to be isolating at home with electronic ankle bracelets we had a story a
[3:21:02.320 --> 3:21:08.080]  couple of weeks ago where they're introducing nothing is in the state of victoria this program
[3:21:08.080 --> 3:21:12.160]  where you have to download a government app if you're supposed to be self isolating and if the
[3:21:12.160 --> 3:21:19.680]  government calls you up within 15 minutes you have to take a geolocation tagged selfie and send it
[3:21:19.680 --> 3:21:26.160]  to the government just to prove where you are this is beyond the chinese communist style social
[3:21:26.160 --> 3:21:32.160]  credit score this is the next level and we were asking what the line in the sand would be well
[3:21:32.160 --> 3:21:39.120]  we found that line over the past few days because there has been an uprising we had the yellow vest
[3:21:39.120 --> 3:21:47.200]  in france back in late 2018 into 2019 of course revolting against president macron his globalist
[3:21:47.200 --> 3:21:52.400]  measures to basically crush the economy the french farmers route on the streets we saw
[3:21:52.400 --> 3:21:59.760]  that movement expand to germany to the netherlands well now we're seeing the rise of the orange vest
[3:21:59.760 --> 3:22:06.800]  revolution in australia headline out of bright bar chaos down under as anti lockdown protesters
[3:22:06.800 --> 3:22:12.480]  clash with riot police in melbourne the streets of melbourne were plunged into chaos once again on
[3:22:12.480 --> 3:22:17.520]  tuesday as anti lockdown protesters clash with riot police forcing police vehicles to retreat as
[3:22:17.520 --> 3:22:24.000]  they smash windows and held makeshift missiles this is the construction workers whose union told them
[3:22:24.000 --> 3:22:30.400]  that they would be mandated to take the covid 19 vaccine or lose their jobs we have a video about
[3:22:30.400 --> 3:22:36.320]  this and i'm going to talk about the latest when we get back but here is what is happening in australia
[3:22:36.320 --> 3:22:42.640]  with the rise of the orange vest movement here's the clip are we witnessing the start of a yellow
[3:22:42.640 --> 3:22:49.440]  vest style revolt in australia or more accurately is this the beginning of the orange vest uprising
[3:22:49.440 --> 3:22:54.960]  the union that represents construction workers mandated that they all get the vaccine or lose
[3:22:54.960 --> 3:23:00.880]  their jobs suffice to say they weren't too happy about it a day after attempting to storm the union
[3:23:00.880 --> 3:23:05.680]  building itself construction workers marched through melbourne wearing yellow and orange
[3:23:05.680 --> 3:23:17.520]  jackets while chanting f the jab and enough is enough
[3:23:17.520 --> 3:23:31.360]  another video showed police cars fleeing as they were confronted by demonstrators
[3:23:31.360 --> 3:23:37.520]  fuck they're throwing shit at the coppers look at that look at that they're throwing shit at the
[3:23:37.520 --> 3:23:41.040]  coppers get him
[3:23:45.920 --> 3:23:51.200]  protesters reached the west gate freeway blocked traffic in both directions and then occupied
[3:23:51.200 --> 3:23:56.160]  the west gate bridge despite facing traffic jams the people stuck in their vehicles appeared to
[3:23:56.160 --> 3:24:05.840]  offer support
[3:24:09.600 --> 3:24:14.080]  authorities and the media have dismissed the protest as a bunch of right-wing extremists
[3:24:14.080 --> 3:24:19.520]  and neo-nazis wow didn't see that one coming but is this the rallying point that australians have
[3:24:19.520 --> 3:24:26.640]  been crying out for facing draconian restrictions and 11 grand fines merely for protesting is the
[3:24:26.640 --> 3:24:32.880]  yellow or orange jacket the new symbol of resistance just as it was in france does it provide
[3:24:32.880 --> 3:24:38.480]  ossees with a unifying emblem around which they can build solidarity melbourne witnessed numerous
[3:24:38.480 --> 3:24:44.800]  scenes of extreme police brutality during protests this past weekend including a 70 year old woman
[3:24:44.800 --> 3:24:49.760]  being pushed to the floor and pepper sprayed in the face by police because they really care about
[3:24:49.760 --> 3:24:56.000]  public health such scenes have generated increasing anger international condemnation and the realization
[3:24:56.000 --> 3:25:02.080]  that australia is no longer a democratic country but it does now appear that the yellow and orange
[3:25:02.080 --> 3:25:10.000]  vest uprising could be the fork in the road where ossees finally come together and declare enough
[3:25:10.000 --> 3:25:18.720]  is enough so there you have it some actual positive news yes positive news of rare sight
[3:25:18.720 --> 3:25:24.080]  on this broadcast but of course the reason this is happening is because australia continues to
[3:25:24.080 --> 3:25:29.600]  pursue the most brutal the most draconian lockdown in the developed world they had one
[3:25:29.600 --> 3:25:36.720]  covid case for example in a town alice springs which was 800 miles from the nearest city and
[3:25:36.720 --> 3:25:42.560]  they do this time and time again they put the full town into lockdown there's no differentiation
[3:25:42.560 --> 3:25:47.840]  whatsoever i was just looking through the headlines that we've had about australia over the past
[3:25:47.840 --> 3:25:53.840]  six months lockdown australian's alcohol intake monitored and restricted by the state the people
[3:25:53.840 --> 3:25:59.520]  in the public housing the apartments under lockdown again for months and months on end
[3:25:59.520 --> 3:26:04.960]  the only way that they could try and get through it we know by the way that suicides have drastically
[3:26:04.960 --> 3:26:10.320]  increased throughout australia as a result of lockdown some people trying to get through it by
[3:26:10.320 --> 3:26:16.080]  basically drinking their way through it but even the government came along and said no you can't
[3:26:16.080 --> 3:26:21.280]  do that because they really care about your health even as untold numbers of them are committing suicide
[3:26:21.840 --> 3:26:27.120]  the government literally intercepted parcels that family members were sending to these people in
[3:26:27.120 --> 3:26:34.560]  social housing in these apartments searching it for alcohol and confiscating the booze we had top
[3:26:34.560 --> 3:26:39.120]  health officials in australia come out and basically tell the unvaccinated that they'll
[3:26:39.120 --> 3:26:44.400]  remain under lockdown restrictions forever which is another reason why you're seeing this orange vest
[3:26:44.400 --> 3:26:51.520]  revolt we have another headline woman in quarantine harassed by cops were removing face masks to drink
[3:26:51.520 --> 3:26:58.560]  tea in these self-isolation gulags they literally patrol these prisons that they've
[3:26:58.560 --> 3:27:03.200]  kept australians in it was supposed to be self-isolating if they remove their masks for a second to
[3:27:03.200 --> 3:27:09.760]  drink their tea the cops swoop on them meanwhile australian police violate lockdown rules to
[3:27:09.760 --> 3:27:15.520]  host lgbt office party because obviously that's more important so the actual officials enforcing
[3:27:15.520 --> 3:27:21.120]  this brutal lockdown once again as in america with the me hollywood elite the rules don't apply to them
[3:27:21.920 --> 3:27:27.360]  we had australian police pepper spray children for not wearing face masks you've seen numerous
[3:27:27.360 --> 3:27:32.400]  people tackled in the street we had a story at a brisbane about a month ago where an old guy was
[3:27:32.400 --> 3:27:38.480]  jogging in a park exercising you're not supposed to wear a face mask while you're doing hardcore
[3:27:38.480 --> 3:27:43.440]  exercise you could literally choke to death they tackled him dragged him to the ground had a cardiac
[3:27:43.440 --> 3:27:49.680]  arrest we've had authorities are saying they won't hesitate to go door to door we've had australian
[3:27:49.680 --> 3:27:55.120]  health officials telling grandparents don't go anywhere near your grandkids and remember these
[3:27:55.120 --> 3:27:59.600]  orange vests who are out on the streets now in melbourne going up against the police going up against
[3:27:59.600 --> 3:28:06.320]  the union that's mandating them to get this jab they face fines of eleven thousand dollars
[3:28:06.320 --> 3:28:13.840]  merely for engaging in any form of protest that's how bad it's become in fact even posting about
[3:28:13.840 --> 3:28:20.080]  an anti lockdown protest online can not only get you a massive fine it can get you a home visit from
[3:28:20.080 --> 3:28:26.320]  the police we saw that with the pregnant woman who was arrested handcuffed in front of her children
[3:28:26.320 --> 3:28:33.520]  and that was six months ago it's only gotten worse since of course dr kerry chan the new south
[3:28:33.520 --> 3:28:38.080]  wales public health official coming out and saying don't talk to your friends don't talk to your
[3:28:38.080 --> 3:28:43.440]  neighbors don't post about it online don't complain about it well they're not only complaining about
[3:28:43.440 --> 3:28:50.080]  it they're out en masse on the streets rebelling it's a new rise of a new movement the orange vest

[3:30:23.680 --> 3:30:27.920]  trump was going for detente with china and north korea at the time and trumps responded saying it's
[3:30:27.920 --> 3:30:32.800]  a total lie polosi's come out admitted it happened hell she bragged back on january eight that it
[3:30:32.800 --> 3:30:38.400]  took place then and is saying that she honors milley and that he's this courageous person so we're

[3:33:24.240 --> 3:33:30.480]  and there were literally people sat in the cinema wearing masks throughout a two and a half hour
[3:33:30.480 --> 3:33:36.320]  film again they they removed the mask to eat a handful of popcorn because of no we know of course
[3:33:36.320 --> 3:33:41.680]  that the virus knows when you're eating a handful of popcorn and it relents it falls back
[3:33:41.680 --> 3:33:47.520]  but then when you put the popcorn carton down after the mask back on because the cove it knows
[3:33:47.520 --> 3:33:52.320]  that you've put the mask back on it knows that you're not eating the popcorn anymore just as it
[3:33:52.320 --> 3:33:58.240]  knows when you've sat down at the table it's important to wear the mask for that 10 yard walk
[3:33:58.240 --> 3:34:03.040]  from the entrance of the restaurant to the table soon as you've sat down at the table you know
[3:34:03.040 --> 3:34:08.240]  you're safe you know you can remove the mask well the people who were very keen on removing
[3:34:08.240 --> 3:34:12.560]  on removing their masks over the past couple of days once again or the hollywood elite the same
[3:34:12.560 --> 3:34:18.320]  kind of people who will screech at you for not wearing one inside a near empty grocery store
[3:34:19.120 --> 3:34:23.440]  of course we had this story yesterday but there was an update about it which we covered
[3:34:23.440 --> 3:34:28.720]  earlier today first let's explain what happened sunday night at the emmy's this clip is maskless
[3:34:28.720 --> 3:34:34.240]  hollywood elite laugh at you at the emmy's we'll come back and talk about the latest but here it is
[3:34:34.240 --> 3:34:39.280]  is the same hollywood elite who will screech on twitter about you not wearing a face mask in a
[3:34:39.280 --> 3:34:44.560]  near empty grocery store all gathered in close proximity in huge numbers at the emmy's to
[3:34:44.560 --> 3:34:50.320]  slobber all over each other completely maskless and once again they were all attended to by an army
[3:34:50.320 --> 3:34:55.680]  of worker slave drones all of whom had to wear masks i've seen more social distancing in the
[3:34:55.680 --> 3:35:01.200]  fucking gank colony but you're bad for wanting to visit your grandma at thanksgiving the woman
[3:35:01.200 --> 3:35:06.240]  in yellow is rich and famous and thus immune to covid and thus is free to walk without a mask
[3:35:06.240 --> 3:35:10.480]  sadly the staff at the end of the video are not rich or famous lack immunity and thus must cover
[3:35:10.480 --> 3:35:16.080]  their faces for their own good california has a mask mandate for all indoor events even if you're
[3:35:16.080 --> 3:35:21.200]  fully vaccinated but apparently so long as you show up in a backless luxury dior dress and
[3:35:21.200 --> 3:35:26.480]  smother yourself in two million dollars worth of tiffany diamonds the rules no longer apply
[3:35:26.480 --> 3:35:31.760]  four-year-old children in california have to wear face coverings in class yet these twats
[3:35:31.760 --> 3:35:37.440]  gets a genuflect and drool all over each other all night giving speeches about what good people
[3:35:37.440 --> 3:35:43.680]  they are with not a mask in sight my kids eat their lunches on their laps in the school auditorium
[3:35:43.680 --> 3:35:49.280]  facing forward and get yelled at if they talk to friends comedian seth rogan was praised for
[3:35:49.280 --> 3:35:54.880]  being the only self aware person in the room to point out the disconnect let me start by saying
[3:35:54.880 --> 3:36:01.600]  there is way too many of us in this little room what are we doing they said this was outdoors
[3:36:02.240 --> 3:36:10.400]  it's not they lied to us we're in a hermetically sealed tent right now but this wasn't an impromptu
[3:36:10.400 --> 3:36:16.560]  moment of spontaneous self-awareness the jokes were scripted they were written before the event
[3:36:16.560 --> 3:36:21.760]  they're laughing at you they even had some kind of dj announcing that all the covid guidelines
[3:36:21.760 --> 3:36:26.480]  were being followed while the camera literally showed celebrities hugging and kissing
[3:36:26.480 --> 3:36:51.680]  they're taking the piss but despite this avalanche vile hypocrisy what was the main
[3:36:51.680 --> 3:36:58.000]  point of concern afterwards on twitter too many white people winning awards because god forbid
[3:36:58.000 --> 3:37:04.080]  talent should be judged on actual talent and not just on skin pigmentation meanwhile more
[3:37:04.080 --> 3:37:10.960]  footage has emerged of aoc at the metgala being attended to by phalanx of masked worker slaves
[3:37:10.960 --> 3:37:17.040]  while she and her maskless husband laugh it up keep complaining idiots just shut up and keep
[3:37:17.040 --> 3:37:23.680]  complaining well there you have it once again proving that the face nappy is not just the
[3:37:23.680 --> 3:37:30.240]  symbol of conformity it is the symbol of the modern day worker drone slave but don't worry
[3:37:30.240 --> 3:37:35.280]  because the health authorities in all their infinite wisdom have come out and explained this
[3:37:35.280 --> 3:37:42.480]  all the way because they've come out today and said that quote performers performers that means
[3:37:42.480 --> 3:37:49.680]  the rich and famous are exempt from mask rules so move along it's all being explained this is the
[3:37:49.680 --> 3:37:55.120]  LA county department of public health who responded to criticism of what you just saw on that video
[3:37:55.120 --> 3:38:01.680]  by claiming that the rules didn't apply because it was a television production event and it featured
[3:38:01.680 --> 3:38:08.400]  some people in expensive dresses smothered with tiffany diamonds and so you know they were exempt
[3:38:08.400 --> 3:38:14.720]  just like london breed the mayor of san francisco went for a night out in a nightclub
[3:38:14.720 --> 3:38:21.520]  with live music she was seen taking photos maskless again against the rules in california
[3:38:21.520 --> 3:38:29.120]  but she said oh don't be the fun police yeah our point exactly but when they do it they can get away
[3:38:29.120 --> 3:38:34.640]  with it and they do this mealy mouth thing where it's like oh no we're performers so why were the
[3:38:34.640 --> 3:38:42.000]  slaves wearing the masks then if it's a television event even though it's indoors why would only the
[3:38:42.000 --> 3:38:48.400]  celebrities made to not wear masks why were the slaves the worker drones made to wear masks why
[3:38:48.400 --> 3:38:55.520]  weren't they exempt under los angeles county's department of health guidelines everyone aged
[3:38:55.520 --> 3:39:00.800]  two years and older must wear a face covering quote in all indoor public settings venues gatherings
[3:39:00.800 --> 3:39:05.280]  and public and private businesses however after it was asserted the rules don't apply to the rich
[3:39:05.280 --> 3:39:11.360]  and famous the department was forced to respond they said elite this is oliver dotty la county
[3:39:11.360 --> 3:39:16.080]  department of public health tells me that the maskless emmies were not in violation of the mask
[3:39:16.080 --> 3:39:22.160]  mandate because exemptions are made for film television and music productions just like exemptions
[3:39:22.160 --> 3:39:28.800]  are made for john carrey walking through an airport or john carrey walking through airport security
[3:39:28.800 --> 3:39:33.440]  or all those democrats who skipped the vote and got on a private plane and none of them were wearing
[3:39:33.440 --> 3:39:40.080]  masks i guess they were performers as well i guess nancy polosi was a performer when she got to get
[3:39:40.080 --> 3:39:47.520]  her hair done and wasn't wearing a mask inside the hair salon i guess governor gavin newson when
[3:39:47.520 --> 3:39:53.280]  he went for a posh dinner in a fancy french restaurant wasn't wearing a mask in violation
[3:39:53.280 --> 3:39:59.680]  of the rules i guess he was a performer so apparently as long as you're making a television
[3:39:59.680 --> 3:40:05.680]  production or you just describe yourself as a performer covet 19 recognizes that fact and
[3:40:05.680 --> 3:40:10.560]  doesn't show up for the night much like it disappears as soon as people sit down to eat a
[3:40:10.560 --> 3:40:17.040]  restaurant but not while they walk to the table and in fact the la county health authorities
[3:40:17.040 --> 3:40:23.040]  went further insisting that the event organizers quote exceeded the baseline requirements for
[3:40:23.040 --> 3:40:29.680]  television and film productions despite again being indoors in direct violation of their rules
[3:40:29.680 --> 3:40:33.760]  before asserting that the full vaccination of all is present was one of the most powerful ways to
[3:40:33.760 --> 3:40:38.000]  achieve a safe environment yeah even though you admit your vaccines are crap and they don't work
[3:40:38.000 --> 3:40:43.840]  properly and they can still spread the virus even though they're vaccinated so again apparently if
[3:40:43.840 --> 3:40:50.000]  you're a performer or in other words rich and famous you don't have to wear a mask everybody
[3:40:50.000 --> 3:40:57.760]  is a performer meanwhile brazilian president boltenaro who should have identified as a performer
[3:40:57.760 --> 3:41:03.040]  and then maybe he would have been allowed inside restaurants in new york forced to eat pizza on
[3:41:03.040 --> 3:41:08.560]  sidewalk in new york because he's not vaccinated even though he had covered and recovered from it
[3:41:08.560 --> 3:41:14.080]  has natural immunity which gives him 27 times more protection than yet in the vaccine he's not
[3:41:14.080 --> 3:41:19.120]  allowed inside a pizza restaurant in new york again should have identified as a performer
[3:41:20.000 --> 3:41:24.640]  after arriving for the u n general assembly brazilian president jaia boltenaro was forced
[3:41:24.640 --> 3:41:28.960]  to eat pizza on the sidewalk because he's not vaccinated and therefore banned from indoor
[3:41:28.960 --> 3:41:34.240]  dining in new york while elites in hollywood and new york get to ignore covid restrictions when
[3:41:34.240 --> 3:41:39.440]  attending indoor events like at the armies being the leader of a major country isn't enough to get
[3:41:39.440 --> 3:41:46.560]  you an exemption of course we had the story a couple of days ago where the united nations itself came
[3:41:46.560 --> 3:41:54.720]  out in violation of new york's rules and said people attending that globalist confab the globalist
[3:41:54.720 --> 3:41:59.760]  who haven't had their vaccine maybe because they know what's in it they won't have to provide a
[3:41:59.760 --> 3:42:07.040]  vaccine passport or any kind of covid check to enter the u n building for this general assembly
[3:42:07.040 --> 3:42:13.040]  meeting in new york so again i guess they you know they identified as performers or music
[3:42:13.040 --> 3:42:17.600]  musicians or they were just rich and famous or they were just very powerful they're not
[3:42:17.600 --> 3:42:23.600]  subject to the same rules as you meanwhile a black lives matter process is being planned
[3:42:23.600 --> 3:42:27.680]  outside a restaurant in new york because three black women were denied entry on the basis that
[3:42:27.680 --> 3:42:33.440]  they couldn't prove they had the jab in some areas of america 50 percent of the black community
[3:42:33.440 --> 3:42:40.640]  hasn't had the jab is this how we defeat the vaccine passport in california in new york by
[3:42:40.640 --> 3:42:47.680]  pointing out that it's discriminatory and it's creating segregation which as we know is racist
[3:42:47.680 --> 3:42:52.240]  could that be the ultimate death now for the vaccine passport in new york don't go away submit
[3:42:52.240 --> 3:42:58.800]  don't use it you'll be right back i'm up here working on a thursday night in mid april 2021
[3:42:59.440 --> 3:43:03.200]  and i just want to say something i am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew
[3:43:03.920 --> 3:43:07.440]  that has come together over the years and is truly an answer to prayer and i am so
[3:43:07.440 --> 3:43:12.000]  blessed and thankful for all of you the listeners of this show i want you to know that i love you
[3:43:12.000 --> 3:43:16.720]  and i appreciate you whether you are old whether you are spanish white black it doesn't matter you
[3:43:16.720 --> 3:43:21.920]  got red blood and if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children we are
[3:43:21.920 --> 3:43:27.280]  brothers and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over
[3:43:27.280 --> 3:43:32.720]  the years and as crazy your things are i want to keep working into the future but again that's
[3:43:32.720 --> 3:43:38.880]  really up to you and up to god so please i hope god works through you and and put some messages
[3:43:38.880 --> 3:43:42.800]  in your heart to support us but again that's up to you and your relationship with god i just want
[3:43:42.800 --> 3:43:47.680]  to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done and just ask you
[3:43:47.680 --> 3:43:52.320]  again to pray to god and ask what god's vision is for you and hopefully god will touch your
[3:43:52.320 --> 3:43:59.120]  heart to continue to support him for worse god bless globalist general milley has revealed to
[3:43:59.120 --> 3:44:04.160]  the world that the united states is not a free republic but is run by a permanent stay behind
[3:44:04.160 --> 3:44:10.640]  network bureaucracy the big takeaway here is is that he didn't act alone he felt that he was safe
[3:44:10.640 --> 3:44:16.480]  to talk on an overseas phone line system that he knew was being watched by the star government
[3:44:16.480 --> 3:44:21.600]  the five eyes of the russians and the chinese he wanted the world to know that he was proud of
[3:44:21.600 --> 3:44:26.880]  what he was doing because he was backed by the deep state this permanent bureaucracy sees america
[3:44:26.880 --> 3:44:33.280]  as its enemy it sees the american people as its enemy it sees prosperity as its enemy and it conspired
[3:44:33.280 --> 3:44:38.160]  with the communist chinese to threaten them basically and say trump may nuke you but if he
[3:44:38.160 --> 3:44:43.840]  tries we'll call and say we're attacking you so you can respond first that's beyond treason
[3:44:43.840 --> 3:44:48.720]  but it shows the type of anti-american sycophants living in their own vetted bubble they try to get
[3:44:48.720 --> 3:44:53.120]  away with this milley and all of his accomplices need to go to prison now for life
[3:44:56.480 --> 3:45:02.880]  it is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told
[3:45:02.880 --> 3:45:08.320]  and the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses which is why fluoridated
[3:45:08.320 --> 3:45:14.720]  water is a big problem consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland
[3:45:14.720 --> 3:45:20.240]  and shuts down its natural functions natural functions which have been known for millennia
[3:45:20.240 --> 3:45:25.520]  the hindu chakras align with the endocrine system the chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the
[3:45:25.520 --> 3:45:31.840]  third eye also described as the seat of the soul the pineal gland is what connects us to higher
[3:45:31.840 --> 3:45:38.240]  levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality fluoride free water is
[3:45:38.240 --> 3:45:44.240]  essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy our water filtration systems with the proper
[3:45:44.240 --> 3:45:50.800]  filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free and the propure showerhead will seal the deal

[3:46:59.280 --> 3:47:01.520]  listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:10.720 --> 3:47:17.760]  live from london england it's haul joseph watson with summit.news
[3:47:17.760 --> 3:47:25.040]  of course joe biden has genuflected in front of the u n globalist to push the
[3:47:25.040 --> 3:47:29.840]  myth of man made global warming once again today vowing to double aid to developing
[3:47:29.840 --> 3:47:34.960]  countries vulnerable to climate crisis even as all their predictions about the climate
[3:47:34.960 --> 3:47:39.440]  crisis have proven spectacularly wrong these are the same people who said we'd enter a new
[3:47:39.440 --> 3:47:44.560]  ice age in the seventies these are the same people who say arctic ice is going to disappear
[3:47:44.560 --> 3:47:49.840]  every single summer they're proven wrong time and time again well we have a group here in the
[3:47:49.840 --> 3:47:55.120]  uk which has proven particularly virulent it's called extinction rebellion despite the fact
[3:47:55.120 --> 3:48:01.280]  that it's literally extinction establishment because all of their narratives are being amplified
[3:48:01.280 --> 3:48:08.160]  by academia by the media by celebrities by cultural institutions it's far from a rebellion
[3:48:08.160 --> 3:48:14.480]  if every organ of the establishment is pushing the same narrative and they've been out once again
[3:48:14.480 --> 3:48:22.560]  blocking roads stopping people with actual jobs from getting to work here in the uk for the fifth
[3:48:22.560 --> 3:48:28.960]  time in the space of the week m25 protest 38 arrested as insulate britain group blocks
[3:48:28.960 --> 3:48:32.960]  motorway for fifth time they've just rebranded themselves from extinction rebellion because
[3:48:32.960 --> 3:48:38.160]  everyone hates extinction rebellion these are the same people who literally blocked commuter
[3:48:38.160 --> 3:48:43.680]  trains two years ago stop people from from getting to work at six a.m in the morning
[3:48:43.680 --> 3:48:48.560]  because apparently electric powered commuter trains are now part of the problem as well
[3:48:49.280 --> 3:48:54.160]  38 people have been arrested after climate protesters from the insulate britain its extinction
[3:48:54.160 --> 3:49:01.680]  rebellion call it what it is attempted to block the m25 for a fifth time they're literally causing
[3:49:01.680 --> 3:49:07.360]  pilots running in the middle of a busy road there was a woman airlifted to hospital they've had
[3:49:07.360 --> 3:49:13.600]  actual insulation engineers stopped from getting to work trying to carry out the very thing that
[3:49:13.600 --> 3:49:20.720]  they demand their complete idiots their ego maniacs doing it for the instagram clout here's a quick
[3:49:20.720 --> 3:49:27.200]  video summarizing what we've witnessed so far this is extinction rebellion idiots block roads
[3:49:27.200 --> 3:49:34.480]  yet again let's go to the clip extinction rebellion activists caused commuter chaos for people who
[3:49:34.480 --> 3:49:40.480]  have actual jobs by blocking roads outside of london for the fourth time in a week because it's
[3:49:40.480 --> 3:49:47.680]  so universally loathed extinction rebellion has rebranded itself as insulate britain they're so
[3:49:47.680 --> 3:49:53.040]  desperate to insulate britain that their road blockades have stopped actual insulation engineers
[3:49:53.040 --> 3:49:58.720]  from getting to work galaxy brain genius the group's ringleader is so concerned about home
[3:49:58.720 --> 3:50:03.840]  insulation that his own home users gas central heating is single glazed and has no insulation
[3:50:03.840 --> 3:50:09.520]  in any of the walls such commitment to the course the group's main achievement appears to be massively
[3:50:09.520 --> 3:50:16.640]  increasing the number of cars spewing co2 as they see idling again genius while also causing a huge
[3:50:16.640 --> 3:50:21.840]  pile up that led to a massive car accident leading to a woman being airlifted to hospital with
[3:50:21.840 --> 3:50:27.600]  serious injuries well done dickhead but just like back in 2019 when the idiots found out what happens
[3:50:27.600 --> 3:50:32.080]  when you try to stop a train full of people getting to work early in the morning irate commuters
[3:50:32.080 --> 3:50:37.840]  angrily confronted them once again
[3:51:02.080 --> 3:51:12.320]  why the f**k are you out protesting when the government is doing everything you want anyway
[3:51:12.320 --> 3:51:18.960]  banning petrol cars forcing britain to pursue zero carbon implementing disastrous green energy
[3:51:18.960 --> 3:51:24.400]  policies that lead to massive unemployment and soaring energy prices they're already doing
[3:51:24.400 --> 3:51:30.640]  all that so what are you protesting for borris johnson literally installed his eco mentalist
[3:51:30.640 --> 3:51:36.400]  wife in number 10 downing street as the de facto prime minister of the country and you're still
[3:51:36.400 --> 3:51:43.360]  whining the financial times the davos billionaires paper of record lavishly praises you and you still
[3:51:43.360 --> 3:51:49.360]  think you're fighting the system while cracking the heads of anti lockdown protesters the police
[3:51:49.360 --> 3:51:55.120]  treat you like they're providing friendly customer service and you think you're going up against the
[3:51:55.120 --> 3:52:08.880]  man
[3:52:08.880 --> 3:52:14.160]  foreign office minister james cleverly appeared on gmb this morning to re-emphasize that the
[3:52:14.160 --> 3:52:20.080]  government is totally acquiescing to all your demands little tip for you here if the media
[3:52:20.080 --> 3:52:26.800]  transnational corporations cultural institutions celebrities and academia are all amplifying
[3:52:26.800 --> 3:52:32.800]  the exact same message as you and if the government is literally implementing the very same policies
[3:52:32.800 --> 3:52:39.840]  that you're demanding you're not the rebellion you're the establishment so there you have it and
[3:52:39.840 --> 3:52:46.480]  those idiots hippie morons were out blocking traffic yet again this morning they had the guy on
[3:52:46.480 --> 3:52:52.480]  gb news the founder of the group turns out his home isn't insulated he's got single glazing
[3:52:52.480 --> 3:52:58.560]  and gas heating and he's not going to do anything about it again i've been an anti lockdown protest
[3:52:58.560 --> 3:53:04.400]  if they try to block a road in many cases the exact same road in west minster on parliament square
[3:53:05.360 --> 3:53:10.800]  they send the riot police in within 10 minutes to crack heads meanwhile you saw the clip there
[3:53:10.800 --> 3:53:15.200]  oh you're feeling uncomfortable if you have any complaints just let us know it's like they've been
[3:53:15.200 --> 3:53:21.520]  given customer service the police are doing their bidding the government's doing their bidding passing
[3:53:21.520 --> 3:53:30.080]  all the policies they want why are they even out there absolutely insane meanwhile and we're going
[3:53:30.080 --> 3:53:35.040]  to go to this clip here final clip of the show fouchy struggles to answer why americans with
[3:53:35.040 --> 3:53:41.920]  natural covid immunity should get vaccinated during a segment on cnn dr. antony fouchy
[3:53:41.920 --> 3:53:46.960]  the great deity now struggled to explain why americans who have natural immunity to covid should
[3:53:46.960 --> 3:53:54.320]  get the vaccine and here is what he said let's go to the clip and just real quickly there was a
[3:53:54.320 --> 3:53:59.200]  study that came out of israel about natural immunity and basically the headline was that
[3:53:59.200 --> 3:54:06.480]  natural immunity provides a lot of protection even better than the vaccines alone what are people
[3:54:06.480 --> 3:54:11.280]  to make of that so so as we talk about vaccine mandates there are i get calls all the time
[3:54:11.280 --> 3:54:16.960]  people say i've already had covid i'm protected and now the study says maybe even more protected
[3:54:16.960 --> 3:54:21.200]  than the vaccine alone should they also get the vaccine how do you make the case to them
[3:54:23.200 --> 3:54:27.600]  you know that's a really good point sanjay i don't have a really firm answer feel on that
[3:54:27.600 --> 3:54:32.560]  that's something that we're going to have to discuss regarding the durability of the response
[3:54:32.560 --> 3:54:38.560]  the one thing the paper from israel didn't tell you is whether or not as high as the protection
[3:54:38.560 --> 3:54:44.320]  is with natural infection what's the durability compared to the durability of a vaccine so it
[3:54:44.320 --> 3:54:48.960]  is conceivable that you got infected you're protected but you may not be protected for
[3:54:48.960 --> 3:54:54.240]  an indefinite period of time so i think that is something that we need to sit down and discuss
[3:54:54.240 --> 3:54:58.960]  seriously because you're very appropriately pointed out it is an issue and there could be
[3:54:58.960 --> 3:55:06.400]  an argument for saying what you said and where where are we on kids below the age of so there
[3:55:06.400 --> 3:55:12.240]  you have it he said the covid immunity natural covid immunity may not protect people for an
[3:55:12.240 --> 3:55:18.240]  indefinite period of time this is the same guy pushing the boost of vaccines because the vaccine
[3:55:18.240 --> 3:55:24.640]  itself has not protected people for any conceivable length of time less than six months which is why
[3:55:24.640 --> 3:55:30.080]  the booster shots are all already being rolled out then what he said is directly disproven by
[3:55:30.080 --> 3:55:36.160]  the study that sanjay gupta cited which is the times of israel reported show that natural immunity
[3:55:36.160 --> 3:55:43.600]  provided israeli's quote longer lasting delta defense than vaccine so the answer to his question
[3:55:43.600 --> 3:55:51.120]  or his dismissal of this is provided by the study itself says the variant was 27 times more likely
[3:55:51.120 --> 3:55:56.480]  to break through Pfizer protection from january to february and cause symptoms than it was to
[3:55:56.480 --> 3:56:01.760]  penetrate natural immunity from the same period but again you're not going to be allowed to present
[3:56:01.760 --> 3:56:07.520]  natural immunity certificates because it's not about public health it's about mass compliance
[3:56:08.160 --> 3:56:13.840]  meanwhile victor orban gives pope warning about mass migration to the west he asked pope francis
[3:56:13.840 --> 3:56:19.600]  not to let christianity perish as he gave him a gift that challenged the supreme pontiff's advocacy
[3:56:19.600 --> 3:56:26.000]  for mass immigration the king this is the gift he gave him it was a letter that king bella the
[3:56:26.000 --> 3:56:31.120]  fourth wrote for pope innocent the fourth in 1250 where he said the king warned of the looming
[3:56:31.120 --> 3:56:36.480]  threat of the tartar invasion and called for the unity of europe he was ignored 35 years later
[3:56:37.040 --> 3:56:42.640]  he offended off the tartars with great bloodshed so this warning on the consequences of mass
[3:56:42.640 --> 3:56:48.080]  immigration was given to the pope by the hungarian leader victor orban the pope's response and bear
[3:56:48.080 --> 3:56:53.840]  in mind this is the same guy who's pushed globalist u n global warming mantras he's washed the feet
[3:56:53.840 --> 3:57:00.080]  of migrants and said invite them all in from islamic countries into europe he literally came out after
[3:57:00.080 --> 3:57:05.200]  the charlie hebdo massacre and said they were basically justified in what they did he said oh
[3:57:05.200 --> 3:57:11.280]  if you punched my mother i'd respond as well literally justifying the massacre of the cartoonist
[3:57:11.280 --> 3:57:17.280]  in paris well now he's come out and said pope francis says some people want to meet dead as he hits
[3:57:17.280 --> 3:57:22.560]  back at the conservative critics of the catholic church and he basically says anyone who criticizes
[3:57:22.560 --> 3:57:28.560]  the catholic church which is him is engaging in quote the work of the devil no you're engaging in
[3:57:28.560 --> 3:57:33.840]  the work of the devil by completely abandoning all the catholic tenets that you're supposed to
[3:57:33.840 --> 3:57:40.800]  protect and defend which at its core is the christian face of europe as a civilization that's
[3:57:40.800 --> 3:57:59.120]  going to wrap it up summit don't use warrim is next and go away
