[08:00.620 --> 08:06.980]  continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[08:09.860 --> 08:16.740]  it broke as most of you know last week that every major military analyst on
[08:16.740 --> 08:23.740]  cable television and broadcast TV in the news was also being secretly paid by the
[08:23.740 --> 08:29.620]  Pentagon and being given briefings on putting out propaganda and lying to the
[08:29.620 --> 08:38.180]  American people and then posing as is that as if they were individual people
[08:38.180 --> 08:43.180]  who are giving you their personal views as former generals and admirals and
[08:43.180 --> 08:51.500]  weapons makers experts and it's really a propaganda operation within a
[08:51.500 --> 08:56.260]  propaganda operation to even have the New York Times that put out fake stories
[08:56.260 --> 09:00.460]  about aluminum tubes and yellow cake from Niger when they were on the payroll
[09:00.460 --> 09:07.220]  and new so the system reports on itself to try to gain some level some modicum
[09:07.220 --> 09:12.700]  of credibility now let's be clear your local newspaper even in good-sized
[09:12.700 --> 09:17.660]  cities only has a few operatives in it or fellow travelers people they choose
[09:17.660 --> 09:23.380]  because they're small-minded to the party line and are yes mint but when you
[09:23.380 --> 09:30.140]  get up to a rush Limbaugh level or a Ted couple level or a you know the point of
[09:30.140 --> 09:34.900]  where you're one of the major king makers up there like a Bill O'Reilly or
[09:34.900 --> 09:39.260]  Sean Hannity you are a operative you are given talking points and that's come
[09:39.260 --> 09:43.220]  out and that's been admitted billions and billions and billions are spent a
[09:43.220 --> 09:47.180]  year this really started with Bill Clinton it was always going on to some
[09:47.180 --> 09:51.620]  extent but more covertly but under Bill Clinton it went public where they would
[09:51.620 --> 09:57.700]  pay sitcoms dramas to have White House messages and talking points and
[09:57.700 --> 10:04.860]  agendas in their productions but it has broken in the last week that there's
[10:04.860 --> 10:11.380]  another covert operation of the Pentagon and make no mistake Sean Hannity the
[10:11.380 --> 10:18.780]  Wall Street Journal the New York Post the Sunday Times of London and scores of
[10:18.780 --> 10:25.420]  other Rupert Murdoch owned publications and TV news channels have viciously
[10:25.420 --> 10:36.180]  attacked we are changed 9-11 truth myself all of us in the last two weeks let
[10:36.180 --> 10:41.220]  us not forget that in tandem separate from the Rupert Murdoch Empire that was
[10:41.220 --> 10:45.340]  clearly following orders and a directive from the Pentagon and I'm not
[10:45.340 --> 10:50.060]  saying that for effect that's guaranteed the Pentagon is attacking us you
[10:50.060 --> 10:58.140]  understand we're being engaged by Pentagon psyops I feel so sorry for the
[10:58.140 --> 11:01.420]  phony conservatives out there who don't understand they're being spoon-fed
[11:01.420 --> 11:07.260]  they're being pacified by Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh and all these people we
[11:07.260 --> 11:14.180]  had associated press come out last week and say that number two in Al Qaeda had
[11:14.180 --> 11:19.100]  put out an audio tape two hours long on the Internet and then later in the
[11:19.100 --> 11:23.740]  article they said well we have no way of knowing it's him or that it's even real
[11:23.740 --> 11:28.140]  but we'll just have the headline that it is real and that 9-11 truth basically
[11:28.140 --> 11:32.420]  works for Ahmed Denizide and Iran and then that talking point was also picked
[11:32.420 --> 11:36.220]  up last week now notice they already previously in the last six months have
[11:36.220 --> 11:40.580]  said 9-11 truth we are changed people that question the visual story need to
[11:40.580 --> 11:48.060]  be arrested tortured taken to secret camps killed beaten to a pulp that we
[11:48.060 --> 11:52.940]  were gonna bomb and oh look we did bomb with no evidence where they say that we
[11:52.940 --> 11:57.740]  bombed the Army recruiting center where we have protested military recruiting
[11:57.740 --> 12:02.020]  center in Times Square and then suddenly they have the provocateurs out with
[12:02.020 --> 12:08.980]  signs in New York saying that coming to our events I mean from Glenn Beck saying
[12:08.980 --> 12:13.140]  use the military against us and that we're traitors and domestic enemies to
[12:13.140 --> 12:18.940]  Sean Hannity saying it to Rush Limbaugh saying it to Michael Weiner savage
[12:18.940 --> 12:23.340]  beatnik saying it I mean there you understand this means we are hurting
[12:23.340 --> 12:27.700]  them bad they know that we've woken up the world public that they carried out
[12:27.700 --> 12:34.180]  the attacks and their minions their attack dogs are attacking us this is
[12:34.180 --> 12:38.980]  letting us know that we are right in there at point blank range on them
[12:38.980 --> 12:44.620]  hurting their fraud their lies big time they're very upset that their favorite
[12:44.620 --> 12:48.860]  tool of government sponsored terrorism their mechanism of self-inflicted
[12:48.860 --> 12:53.460]  wound of false flag events that their big secret their favorite tool their
[12:53.460 --> 12:59.220]  favorite of crisis creation and then crisis management order out of chaos
[12:59.220 --> 13:05.940]  order out of chaos they are so upset that their favorite tool has now been
[13:05.940 --> 13:14.220]  exposed and I'm but I'm here to tell you that I in the last month have been
[13:14.220 --> 13:19.740]  telling my staff my crew that I have never felt and I and I also go off not
[13:19.740 --> 13:24.740]  just my cold analysis of the facts and what's happening but also what's in my
[13:24.740 --> 13:30.700]  heart what's in my spirit and I have never felt more I don't want to say
[13:30.700 --> 13:38.180]  unease or disquiet but just that we're on the cusp of something very big and the
[13:38.180 --> 13:43.180]  fact that they're attacking 9-11 truth tells me and now having to give us so
[13:43.180 --> 13:48.420]  much attention and they're having major because they only have a few
[13:48.420 --> 13:52.940]  Psyop announcements a week and the fact that the last few months much of their
[13:52.940 --> 13:58.660]  front burner you understand the Department of War the Department of
[13:58.660 --> 14:06.740]  Defense is spending a large portion of their time a trying to provocateur
[14:06.740 --> 14:11.900]  riots in coming up in Denver which we're on the front lines of exposing we're
[14:11.900 --> 14:15.100]  trying to shop their their their false flag there we've caught them all over
[14:15.100 --> 14:21.420]  the Canada and the U.S. now we're beating their butt at every front the
[14:21.420 --> 14:24.740]  terrorists that are destroying our sovereignty the terrorists the corporate
[14:24.740 --> 14:29.300]  terrorists that have seized our country and are using it in the in the period of
[14:29.300 --> 14:36.660]  exploitation to take over surrounding nations and other countries we're going
[14:36.660 --> 14:46.420]  toe-to-toe against the terrorist here I'm surveilled this isn't a joke it isn't a
[14:46.420 --> 14:53.660]  game it isn't fun this is very serious you understand this is life and death
[14:53.660 --> 15:03.020]  serious the Pentagon's main propaganda right now is against us they don't play
[15:03.020 --> 15:11.620]  games they've killed over a million people in Iraq in 17 years of siege 17
[15:11.620 --> 15:19.940]  and a half years life means nothing to them the only reason I'm alive is by the
[15:19.940 --> 15:25.700]  grace of God and because they also don't want to make me into a martyr and I talk
[15:25.700 --> 15:29.460]  about this a lot because of people bringing up on the internet constantly
[15:29.460 --> 15:32.740]  everyone's obsessed with them always being asked about it or why am I alive
[15:32.740 --> 15:39.580]  I'm alive because I'm vocal because I'm out front I'm not one tenth as big as
[15:39.580 --> 15:44.460]  somebody like a Martin Luther King or a Bobby Kennedy got it took them while to
[15:44.460 --> 15:49.860]  kill him took him a while to kill Gandhi and frankly I'm sick of everybody
[15:49.860 --> 15:54.300]  talking about it I'm sick of it being an obsession point of the fact that I'm
[15:54.300 --> 16:00.460]  not dead so I must be an operative it doesn't matter a I'm not be use your
[16:00.460 --> 16:05.460]  common sense in your discernment if you've got it I'm telling you you have
[16:05.460 --> 16:09.500]  power I'm telling you you can affect change I'm telling you you have the

[16:25.420 --> 16:29.220]  enemy's favorite tools and I tell the public to stop trusting the media and
[16:29.220 --> 16:35.380]  the government and I tell you don't go join big groups but form your own and I
[16:35.380 --> 16:40.300]  tell you to resist and I tell you to wake up police and military and I
[16:40.300 --> 16:44.660]  energize activist groups that's the opposite of what the enemy does what the
[16:44.660 --> 16:48.820]  enemy does is they tell you we can't win they tell you we're all infiltrated
[16:48.820 --> 16:53.100]  they tell you that we can't work together they tell you that we don't have
[16:53.100 --> 16:59.060]  power they tell you that true leaders are bad so that you don't trust anyone
[16:59.060 --> 17:03.580]  well I'll tell you this you can trust yourself you know you're good out there
[17:03.580 --> 17:10.780]  old young black white male female Hispanic it doesn't matter you know you

[17:21.460 --> 17:28.260]  jacket to carry out their eugenics policies against us and there's a lot
[17:28.260 --> 17:33.300]  of you who do mean well who've been deceived and twisted and a lot of you
[17:33.300 --> 17:39.540]  who have attacked me and committed to attacking me and so now that you've
[17:39.540 --> 17:44.100]  gone down that road you can never admit that you're wrong and so you have to
[17:44.100 --> 17:52.300]  continue to to to obsess on Alex Jones and make things up in your mind or make
[17:52.300 --> 18:01.380]  giant leaps and then never spend your time fighting the new world order and so
[18:01.380 --> 18:06.980]  that you will listen to reason I will say this spend as much time attacking me
[18:06.980 --> 18:14.220]  as you do in fact maybe increase it a little just to be safe but also spend
[18:14.220 --> 18:19.460]  as much time warning people about where we're breaking through false flag
[18:19.460 --> 18:25.500]  terror just expose that paradigm in history that tool that mechanism that
[18:25.500 --> 18:33.340]  that reality so that that renaissance that awakening happens faster expose
[18:33.340 --> 18:36.900]  how they're drugging us and poisoning us to the water supply where it's
[18:36.900 --> 18:43.620]  admitted about the fluoride and the mercury and the shots and they admit
[18:43.620 --> 18:48.780]  that it's causing autism warned people spend some of your times warning people
[18:48.780 --> 18:54.140]  about how the globalists want to dissolve us into an NAU because we need
[18:54.140 --> 18:59.820]  our full energies right now exposing the globalist main programs and
[18:59.820 --> 19:05.140]  operations instead of knitting around thinking that there are goblins under
[19:05.140 --> 19:10.620]  every table the new world order only has the top reporters they only have the
[19:10.620 --> 19:15.740]  big king makers and then the mainstream media most of them they just
[19:15.740 --> 19:20.580]  regurgitate what they're told they're in the false map that's been made for
[19:20.580 --> 19:25.380]  their mind the false paradigm the virtual reality the simulation that we're
[19:25.380 --> 19:34.260]  all living in they're not agents they are just downloaded the lie and they're
[19:34.260 --> 19:40.380]  now easy to reach and they're waking up I'm going to explain this paradigm more

[23:51.620 --> 23:56.540]  the fight back to big brother well they've been riots in some countries
[23:56.540 --> 24:02.820]  I know what do you make of all of this well we've we've had warning for the
[24:02.820 --> 24:07.500]  number of years grain stocks have been dropping I think every year for the last
[24:07.500 --> 24:16.860]  ten years are pretty close to that the reserves and the environment in so many
[24:16.860 --> 24:21.900]  different areas is being the pressure being put on it by the ever-increasing
[24:21.900 --> 24:26.620]  number of people and the number of people using more stuff and more energy
[24:26.620 --> 24:31.300]  that's what's leading to global climate climate change and and the
[24:31.300 --> 24:35.220]  overfishing of the oceans there there are a lot of different problems that are
[24:35.220 --> 24:41.100]  being caused by an ever-increasing number of people in a finite sized world
[24:41.100 --> 24:46.420]  and they're just the resources of the planet just can't keep up with the
[24:46.420 --> 24:52.260]  demands and I'm afraid that this is going to be more commonplace I think
[24:52.260 --> 24:58.660]  we're just seeing the tip of the iceberg it's very complicated I do want to say
[24:58.660 --> 25:05.540]  because agriculture is complicated anyway and as for instance saw China adds
[25:05.540 --> 25:11.300]  more cars they they need more roads and the only place to put roads in China is
[25:11.300 --> 25:16.660]  over farmland so you lose farmland as you as you have increased development
[25:16.660 --> 25:39.340]  we're doing it even here in the United States got a couple questions so they're
[25:39.340 --> 25:46.700]  selling eugenics sounds reasonable oh we're having food riots because we don't
[25:46.700 --> 25:53.820]  have the farmland doesn't matter of the US just a few decades ago could feed the
[25:53.820 --> 25:58.540]  world three to four times over now we can't even feed ourselves big agribusiness
[25:58.540 --> 26:04.780]  has taken over 95% of the population is not self-sufficient only 5% is on the
[26:04.780 --> 26:10.740]  land 10% is rural but only 5% total half of that number is even somewhat
[26:10.740 --> 26:15.460]  self-sufficient they've got it just where they want us we have the official IMF
[26:15.460 --> 26:18.740]  and World Bank documents we have the official State Department memorandum
[26:18.740 --> 26:22.980]  200 we have the official treaty signed with the IMF and World Bank with third
[26:22.980 --> 26:27.940]  World Nations and developing second World Nations to reduce their numbers of
[26:27.940 --> 26:32.660]  population and to cut back on the amount of food produced and we understand and
[26:32.660 --> 26:37.500]  know that we know that Rwanda was a UN test to kill a minority 800,000 that's
[26:37.500 --> 26:41.460]  the conservative number it's really about a million and a half Tootsies use
[26:41.460 --> 26:46.740]  the Hutus to do that the Christian minority was murdered and Ted Turner has
[26:46.740 --> 26:49.980]  given over a billion dollars to carry out eugenics operations just like
[26:49.980 --> 26:54.380]  Bill and Linda Gates have and again they head up Planned Parenthood his daddy
[26:54.380 --> 27:00.860]  does but doesn't matter you hear on the news they're helping black children they
[27:00.860 --> 27:07.260]  care so much about them and that's what we're dealing with and so that's the
[27:07.260 --> 27:10.820]  message we have to get out there to people we have been trained to be
[27:10.820 --> 27:16.180]  Balkan eyes we have been trained to fight fight with each other I you ever
[27:16.180 --> 27:20.900]  gone crab fishing you throw a bunch of crabs in a bucket and if one crab tries
[27:20.900 --> 27:25.820]  to climb out instead of them working together like humans would do or wolves
[27:25.820 --> 27:31.900]  or big cats on the Savannah and Africa lions no they are they are a prey
[27:31.900 --> 27:36.780]  animal so they don't work together like rabbits or deer or anything else and the
[27:36.780 --> 27:42.500]  crabs will come up and attack the other crab that tries to climb out and they
[27:42.500 --> 27:47.260]  leave each other alone unless one tries to climb out and we have been trained to
[27:47.260 --> 27:52.620]  do the same thing so I'm trying to get you to rediscover the Liberty culture I'm
[27:52.620 --> 27:57.380]  trying to get you to rediscover yourselves your families and not feeling
[27:57.380 --> 28:01.140]  inadequate not letting Madison Avenue sell you on the fact that you're not
[28:01.140 --> 28:05.020]  beautiful or you're not important or you don't have power everything they do is
[28:05.020 --> 28:09.140]  about making you feel inadequate and the superstars on TV they're somehow
[28:09.140 --> 28:14.900]  fulfilled they've somehow got lives they're somehow happy I mean people
[28:14.900 --> 28:19.980]  think that movie stars are just in heaven people think that billionaires are
[28:19.980 --> 28:25.180]  in some type of heaven people think that because I'm a talk show host that I'm
[28:25.180 --> 28:30.300]  somehow superhuman and float around on clouds not the case ladies and gentlemen
[28:30.300 --> 28:37.420]  put my pants on one leg at a time get headaches stomach aches pay bills you know
[28:37.420 --> 28:44.500]  take care of crying babies change diapers you know deal with employees I
[28:44.500 --> 28:50.820]  mean all of it and then you also have this this this system of where the
[28:50.820 --> 28:55.300]  population hates the elite hates the quote wealthy hates the guy next door
[28:55.300 --> 28:59.780]  who's got a better car than they do and thinks that you know we all have to fight
[28:59.780 --> 29:03.220]  with each other but but meanwhile don't have a real definition of who the elite
[29:03.220 --> 29:07.220]  are what the elite are doing the elite hates you the elite have a predatory
[29:07.220 --> 29:13.100]  idea of who you are but you don't even know who the elite are or how the real
[29:13.100 --> 29:19.100]  world system operates I mean I've spent more than a decade studying this 10 plus
[29:19.100 --> 29:24.460]  hours a day I mean I'm constantly researching and then the mountain of
[29:24.460 --> 29:28.300]  information understanding is so great there's no way to even properly
[29:28.300 --> 29:35.180]  articulate it but just have a good attitude realize we can beat these
[29:35.180 --> 29:40.460]  people but we got to take action first we'll be right back with tons of news

[31:58.420 --> 32:02.300]  join church and state this confederation of evangelicals Catholics and
[32:02.300 --> 32:05.980]  Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting block their
[32:05.980 --> 32:09.620]  agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation
[32:09.620 --> 32:12.940]  our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this
[32:12.940 --> 32:16.420]  freedom liberty of conscience history and the Bible proved to them that these
[32:16.420 --> 32:20.460]  two systems church and state must be kept separate it must be our love of God
[32:20.460 --> 32:24.140]  and of country that prompts or constrains us this will change the
[32:24.140 --> 32:27.620]  character not civil enforcement from history we saw that when church and
[32:27.620 --> 32:31.420]  state united known as papal Rome religious intolerance resulted this
[32:31.420 --> 32:34.700]  union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation
[32:34.700 --> 32:39.140]  America and papal Rome are uniting in this agenda Protestant America awake

[33:02.100 --> 33:24.580]  okay I'm gonna go ahead and play this audio of Phil Hayton this is the BBC
[33:24.580 --> 33:30.940]  news presenter who was talking to Jane Stanley 25 minutes or so before
[33:30.940 --> 33:34.900]  building seven collapsed and they said settlement brothers building has
[33:34.900 --> 33:41.060]  collapsed that's building seven and then they gave the official reason it fell
[33:41.060 --> 33:46.300]  and why it fell as it did then magically symmetrically fall and this is false
[33:46.300 --> 33:52.860]  flying scripting two separate BBC channels BBC 24 and BBC world and he was
[33:52.860 --> 33:58.780]  working with BBC world they both reported the same thing as it fell and about an
[33:58.780 --> 34:04.220]  hour before that Aaron Brown who lives in New York was reporting that it had
[34:04.220 --> 34:07.100]  fallen and then he's reading off a teleprompter and he turns behind him and
[34:07.100 --> 34:11.020]  sees that it's still standing and he says well this is strange but we're being
[34:11.020 --> 34:17.140]  told it's it's fallen from fires and couple complete collapse this is red
[34:17.140 --> 34:22.980]  handed just like it's red handed that Intel Center puts out videos and
[34:22.980 --> 34:28.940]  audios in their own format in their own video layer they put their logo in the
[34:28.940 --> 34:37.420]  same video layer as al-Qaeda's video projection video render top TV experts
[34:37.420 --> 34:43.060]  top computer and your mainstream news reports that's just it's over red
[34:43.060 --> 34:46.860]  handed I mean the government is so lazy that the criminals that run our
[34:46.860 --> 34:52.420]  government are so lazy that they put out fake videos in the same video layer as
[34:52.420 --> 34:58.260]  their bug same pixels same placement and then now they're putting out audios
[34:58.260 --> 35:01.900]  because we track their videos and then admitting well that it isn't even the
[35:01.900 --> 35:07.820]  person saying that 9-11 truth works with Ahmed denigide I mean now al-Qaeda
[35:07.820 --> 35:12.820]  agrees with the government on every front you know Saddam says I'm not
[35:12.820 --> 35:16.580]  working with al-Qaeda and then bin Laden puts out a tape supposedly saying oh yes
[35:16.580 --> 35:26.820]  I work with him every day we're good friends see it's proof Bush says so here
[35:26.820 --> 35:32.060]  is we are change England questioning him and the guy is lying I mean you can see
[35:32.060 --> 35:37.140]  it he's saying I don't remember oh I didn't go into work that day I would have
[35:37.140 --> 35:42.460]  known I mean how would you forget for hours and hours being in studio on 9
[35:42.460 --> 35:49.180]  11 he's a pretty young guy it looks like he's probably about 60 maybe 59 or so but
[35:49.180 --> 35:54.740]  the point is he's very sharp and he but he's not a good bluffer and he goes oh
[35:54.740 --> 36:00.380]  yes I was there that's right I dropped my son off and then I went and but then he
[36:00.380 --> 36:04.340]  says oh it does kind of sound like a conspiracy now Jane Stanley says she
[36:04.340 --> 36:07.940]  won't talk to anybody she says I've been quote harassed about this I will not
[36:07.940 --> 36:13.420]  discuss it BBC editors say they made a mistake that day but the tapes have been
[36:13.420 --> 36:17.660]  accidentally destroyed yeah they just destroyed the 9-11 tapes of that day and
[36:17.660 --> 36:22.140]  they admit that it is real they did report beforehand but then the
[36:22.140 --> 36:26.020]  detractors come on the web posing as patriots they the government loves to do
[36:26.020 --> 36:31.980]  that and says Alex Jones and everybody have put out fake BBC videos they put
[36:31.980 --> 36:37.140]  out hundreds of these saying we're you know this isn't real the BBC never did
[36:37.140 --> 36:40.140]  this they just made this up this isn't even BBC footage
[36:40.140 --> 36:44.460]  I mean while BBC admits they reported it early but it's enough to throw people
[36:44.460 --> 36:50.100]  off balance it's just like they'll still say Iraq has WMD's on neocontrol radio
[36:50.100 --> 36:53.180]  or they'll still say that they've built the fence on the border or they'll still
[36:53.180 --> 36:58.820]  say that it's not amnesty or they'll say I mean they just flat out lie oh there's
[36:58.820 --> 37:01.580]  been a new big development I don't know we'll have time to play it today but we
[37:01.580 --> 37:07.540]  may the girl in the wheelchair now we have three witnesses they've knocked the
[37:07.540 --> 37:16.900]  camera out of his hand and broke it the police report says that Gary was
[37:16.900 --> 37:21.540]  accidental assault that's what that's what class C is it says he accidentally
[37:21.540 --> 37:27.260]  hurt someone but but but so even with the police report it's accidental but
[37:27.260 --> 37:33.460]  when you read the New York Post Wall Street Journal it says that he savagely
[37:33.460 --> 37:37.540]  beat the woman in the wheelchair over and over again see see how it has the
[37:37.540 --> 37:42.580]  Pentagon sound just like throwing babies out of incubators or gassing puppies and
[37:42.580 --> 37:48.060]  that was a fake video oh they gas the baby lab oh they throw the babies out of
[37:48.060 --> 37:52.860]  incubators oh oh this we are change group works with Ahmed Denizide they need
[37:52.860 --> 37:58.620]  to be sent to secret camps and tortured that's a quote they they they beat a
[37:58.620 --> 38:01.640]  woman they beat her and beat her and beat her and beat her and beat her and
[38:01.640 --> 38:04.700]  beat her and beat her but the police report says she didn't have any marks
[38:04.700 --> 38:11.980]  on her the police report says that Gary accidentally hurt the father and they've
[38:11.980 --> 38:14.340]  now gone to the place they're trying to get the security people to give them the
[38:14.340 --> 38:18.700]  video they're trying to raise money to subpoena yet the tapes before they get
[38:18.700 --> 38:24.460]  erased it won't matter when the tapes come out showing the guy attacking the
[38:24.460 --> 38:29.220]  neocons are already saying so what on their websites good glad the dad beat
[38:29.220 --> 38:35.300]  him up but they have this girl call in the stage call they always do it this
[38:35.300 --> 38:41.420]  way oh hi who's this hand he says I'm the girl who they attacked oh honey you're
[38:41.420 --> 38:52.420]  the one that the 9-11 truth they're savagely beat I mean this is totally and
[38:52.420 --> 38:56.540]  completely staged the witnesses all report and then they knocked the camera
[38:56.540 --> 39:02.460]  out of his hand but that that he comes down the sidewalk as Gary's leaving and
[39:02.460 --> 39:06.620]  totally changes direction and runs her into him and starts screaming he attacked
[39:06.620 --> 39:14.100]  her he attacked her and then starts wailing on him now remember he was
[39:14.100 --> 39:18.540]  smart to first thing when it was that swatted that camera full power knocking
[39:18.540 --> 39:27.660]  into the wall it's broken I bought the camera I paid for it it's broken and I'm
[39:27.660 --> 39:33.140]  already digressing I said I'd get to the other thing it's just unbelievable these
[39:33.140 --> 39:37.580]  are the same people that told you Iraq had WMD's these are the same people where
[39:37.580 --> 39:42.140]  the Pentagon has hired thousands of reporters to put out lies and fraud these
[39:42.140 --> 39:48.500]  are the same people that pay for fake news but the most Americans don't even
[39:48.500 --> 39:52.940]  know that Rupert Murdoch now owns the Wall Street Journal the Wall Street
[39:52.940 --> 40:02.340]  Journal Friday came out and attacked us and said that we assaulted a woman in a
[40:02.340 --> 40:04.620]  wheelchair
[40:07.940 --> 40:18.300]  but the police report says accidental assault which itself is a fraud but the
[40:18.300 --> 40:26.260]  cops weren't sure when they wrote that report if there was video so they had to
[40:26.260 --> 40:34.220]  be a little careful and say well he he accidentally hurt the guy but so see
[40:34.220 --> 40:39.740]  that's admitted lie admitted fraud in the New York Post in the Wall Street
[40:39.740 --> 40:42.900]  Journal remember the Wall Street Journal is worthless it's been worthless for
[40:42.900 --> 40:47.260]  years but Rupert Murdoch now owns it he's turning it directly into a Pentagon
[40:47.260 --> 40:51.740]  propaganda arm forget having agents of influence in there forget having some
[40:51.740 --> 40:58.940]  mockingbird agents in there in editor positions it's now a full rag yellow
[40:58.940 --> 41:08.980]  journalism we're gonna play that later today but talk about breathing down our
[41:08.980 --> 41:13.900]  necks the AP coming out saying 9-11 truth gets all its info from Ahmed
[41:13.900 --> 41:19.220]  Denizide and Al Qaeda is saying this Al Qaeda helping the neocons now CIA
[41:19.220 --> 41:22.340]  well yeah the White House admits they're using real Al Qaeda to attack Iran
[41:22.340 --> 41:26.020]  while then saying Iran is Al Qaeda and then McCain said two weeks ago to with
[41:26.020 --> 41:35.620]  Betrayus is Iran Al Qaeda and he said yes they are I mean that's the Alice in
[41:35.620 --> 41:40.820]  Wonderland world we live in and I you know the sad part is they're not all
[41:40.820 --> 41:44.180]  agents and everybody on Free Republic everybody on Michelle Malcolm's side
[41:44.180 --> 41:51.140]  and everybody on these sites they're not all agents they really believe it they
[41:51.140 --> 41:54.940]  really think we're leftist enemies they really think we're communists they
[41:54.940 --> 41:58.100]  really think they're saving the country they really think that the Bush is for
[41:58.100 --> 42:02.220]  the controlling the borders they really think Bush is a conservative they
[42:02.220 --> 42:10.900]  really believe we beat up a girl in a wheelchair because you see this is how
[42:10.900 --> 42:17.180]  it worked with the Nazis once you invest in something once you say hall Hitler
[42:17.180 --> 42:24.540]  once you say I'm a communist once you say you're going along with evil once
[42:24.540 --> 42:28.300]  you've been involved in something for a while you don't want to admit you're
[42:28.300 --> 42:32.300]  wrong most people don't so then they start editing reality so my dad calls it
[42:32.300 --> 42:40.620]  they start making excuses rationalizing they become delusional deluded and they
[42:40.620 --> 42:42.620]  say
[42:44.940 --> 42:48.700]  oh no the government's good the government's not bad because they accepted
[42:48.700 --> 42:54.180]  torture and see evil dictators they stuze populations corrupt systems are
[42:54.180 --> 42:57.580]  very good at this they put out day one when everybody was scared hey we need to
[42:57.580 --> 43:01.660]  torture people they cannot get press conferences saying and then people said
[43:01.660 --> 43:07.700]  all over and they made they had the big heroes on the TV shows CSI CSI Miami 24
[43:07.700 --> 43:12.100]  spooks all these different shows torturing children in front of their
[43:12.100 --> 43:16.340]  parents to get answers meanwhile in the real world while you're fantasizing with
[43:16.340 --> 43:20.780]  the good guy you know the good guys torturing a child the good guys torturing
[43:20.780 --> 43:24.740]  something a family the good guys to you know that's the most evil thing you can
[43:24.740 --> 43:32.180]  do is torture a child torture an innocent scared child it's just right
[43:32.180 --> 43:35.180]  out of Jeffrey Dahmer it's as satanic as it gets whatever name you want to give
[43:35.180 --> 43:42.260]  it and they seduced you and then at that point you know when you read about
[43:42.260 --> 43:46.860]  ritual sacrifice and devil worship and mind control that was ancient mind
[43:46.860 --> 43:50.820]  control secret societies were intelligence agencies and if you could
[43:50.820 --> 43:55.180]  get somebody to go kidnap a child and kill them they would be so brought over
[43:55.180 --> 43:59.780]  to evil now and so committed to you that they would have to rationalize and get
[43:59.780 --> 44:06.700]  into evil and fully join evil why does a gang tell the gang member okay to
[44:06.700 --> 44:12.740]  become an outer member of the gang an apprentice you know your crips your
[44:12.740 --> 44:20.100]  bloods that's what they call it a bitch a minion you got to go out and rob a
[44:20.100 --> 44:24.180]  liquor store you got to rob ten houses and then to become an inner member of
[44:24.180 --> 44:28.340]  the gang you got to go kill an old lady an old man it's all or a child it's got
[44:28.340 --> 44:31.740]  to be somebody innocent you got to drive by playground and you got to shoot a
[44:31.740 --> 44:39.860]  kid or if it's a Mexican gang you've got to kill a black person I don't know why
[44:39.860 --> 44:44.340]  but I'm not trying to bash the Mexican gangs it's been all over the news that
[44:44.340 --> 44:49.380]  the black gangs really don't have that as an announced policy and more than nine
[44:49.380 --> 44:53.260]  times out of ten every time I see it it's it's the Mexican gangs in Texas in
[44:53.260 --> 44:58.180]  California killing blacks you got to go kill a myata a black bird as they call
[44:58.180 --> 45:02.620]  them very racist very horrible and they do they go out and they kill the myata
[45:02.620 --> 45:11.860]  the main mission in LA now is to drive quote the myatas out very horrible we
[45:11.860 --> 45:16.180]  knew about this over 12 years ago but I didn't want to cover it too much because
[45:16.180 --> 45:18.340]  we got to be a little politically correct or we had to wait till the LA
[45:18.340 --> 45:23.860]  Times admitted it was all over the news if people couldn't believe that well
[45:23.860 --> 45:33.060]  it's the same thing see you did what a member of the Illuminati would do some
[45:33.060 --> 45:38.500]  judge or some royal prince who's seduced into this in the you know 1800
[45:38.500 --> 45:43.500]  1700s where you finally you know the orgies the sex the partying the drugs
[45:43.500 --> 45:47.020]  the secret knowledge and then finally you're gonna become a real made member
[45:47.020 --> 45:51.540]  you go in and it's local peasants you know supply the babies they have them in
[45:51.540 --> 45:56.740]  secret and you go in and you kill the baby the innocent baby now you're a
[45:56.740 --> 46:03.980]  member of the club well see you are all part of a massive mind control ritual
[46:03.980 --> 46:07.580]  you're an atheist just call it mind control if you're a Christian call it
[46:07.580 --> 46:14.460]  Satanism that's what they believe it is and so you fantasized watching hundreds
[46:14.460 --> 46:19.460]  of episodes of TV where that was done you purse because because it was
[46:19.460 --> 46:28.180]  suspended disbelief you basically took part in a ritual but the ritual was
[46:28.180 --> 46:32.660]  about changing your mind you see let me let's take a child's movie good
[46:32.660 --> 46:38.580]  analogy for people in episode three revenge of the Sith the newly you know
[46:38.580 --> 46:48.340]  ensconced emperor he's all deformed now from his own hate destroying himself
[46:48.340 --> 46:53.860]  there's that symbol he loses something in this transition Darth Vader loses his
[46:53.860 --> 46:57.620]  legs and arms and gets burned have to death in the transition but before that
[46:57.620 --> 47:02.660]  happens the emperor says okay you've got to really increase your power now you
[47:02.660 --> 47:08.260]  need to go kill all these children and he goes and kills hundreds of children at
[47:08.260 --> 47:17.260]  the Jedi temple and then his eyes turn yellow then he's possessed now he
[47:17.260 --> 47:24.940]  really is in the dark side and so that's what this is killing Iraqi children
[47:24.940 --> 47:30.460]  all of people watching TV watching Rumsfeld both in fantasy and in reality
[47:30.460 --> 47:35.860]  simulating watching shows or children or torture defending the Abu Ghraib
[47:35.860 --> 47:40.100]  Limbaugh saying hey what's the big deal they're just blowing off steam they're
[47:40.100 --> 47:46.180]  having fun at Abu Ghraib raping women see now we're an evil country now we can
[47:46.180 --> 47:50.780]  say hey let's go ahead and
[47:52.860 --> 47:58.060]  let's have 50 million abortions now I said I'd play all these clips and I
[47:58.060 --> 48:01.780]  have it but I think when I'm covering here is important you understand how
[48:01.780 --> 48:10.060]  they have seduced you to the dark side for some of you it's too late for others
[48:10.060 --> 48:15.780]  you can still turn back if you feel any guilt now if you're laughing and just
[48:15.780 --> 48:24.660]  feel more demonic and more powerful hearing all of this and you think you're
[48:24.660 --> 48:28.220]  thinking I'm weak right now because I don't want to kill children you're
[48:28.220 --> 48:32.100]  thinking you've got power because you're into that so you've already been totally
[48:32.100 --> 48:43.820]  taken over by it you're gone you're gone and I want you to know that you are not
[48:43.820 --> 48:49.220]  where the real power is you do not have the real power you are weak and you have
[48:49.220 --> 48:53.620]  been robbed of what your soul would have been who you really would have been and
[48:53.620 --> 49:02.860]  the incredible love and light and goodness and strength you think you've
[49:02.860 --> 49:08.100]  been given some special knowledge when you're in the light you have much greater
[49:08.100 --> 49:12.860]  more advanced knowledge inherently than when you're in the dark side the dark
[49:12.860 --> 49:18.740]  side is a fraud the dark side is is people being backstabbed treachery
[49:18.740 --> 49:26.740]  weakness greed avarice unhappiness your own sick groups cheating you manipulating
[49:26.740 --> 49:33.220]  each other playing games you are weak you have no safe harbor you have been
[49:33.220 --> 49:39.340]  deceived and that's why I have defeated in all of us that love God and love

[49:44.020 --> 49:51.380]  lost you think you're strong because you can take a baby and you can slice its
[49:51.380 --> 49:59.260]  guts open and you can poke holes and stab it over and over again you imagine
[49:59.260 --> 50:03.180]  50 60 of these people stabbing a little baby over and over again and sucking
[50:03.180 --> 50:07.060]  blood out of it as it cries and screams for hours and hours and hours and hours
[50:07.060 --> 50:12.580]  keeping it alive as long as they can that's who we face just absolute trash

[54:05.540 --> 54:14.540]  don't call my name out your window I'm leaving I won't even turn my head
[54:14.540 --> 54:22.340]  line BBC anchor who reported on WTC 7 collapse before it happened agrees there
[54:22.340 --> 54:26.540]  may be a conspiracy let's go ahead and play this clip and we'll come back into
[54:26.540 --> 54:30.300]  the next segment finishing it up then we'll get Jim Mars on stay with us here
[54:30.300 --> 54:35.740]  it is yeah I did about 20 wars I spent a lot of time in in Northern Ireland which
[54:35.740 --> 54:41.300]  was a war of sorts wasn't it a lot of time in Beirut the Iranian Revolution
[54:41.300 --> 54:48.220]  attempted coups all over Africa the war in Rhodesia Zimbabwe and so on in 2001
[54:48.220 --> 54:55.820]  you must have been there when the September 11th attacks yes what was
[54:55.820 --> 55:00.860]  your experience of that I was in the theater actually on the South Bank at
[55:00.860 --> 55:06.380]  a matinee and I just got it because I've done the morning program and got in
[55:06.380 --> 55:10.700]  and listen to the PM program and I you know you're trying to piece together
[55:10.700 --> 55:14.580]  what was happening it just sounded absolutely incredible I just staggered
[55:14.580 --> 55:21.020]  by it and I went in as usual the next day for my my shift because they don't
[55:21.020 --> 55:24.620]  rush people in and change everything usually because it's important to keep
[55:24.620 --> 55:28.300]  continuity in the story of that kind is going to be going on for so many days
[55:28.300 --> 55:32.540]  you know you want to keep people rested and refreshed sure so I didn't have
[55:32.540 --> 55:38.540]  anything to do with it on the day right because we we did come across some
[55:38.540 --> 55:45.380]  interesting things to do with war trade centre building 7 that collapsed on 9
[55:45.380 --> 55:53.260]  11 and basically sort of claims that the BBC had reported collapse without
[55:53.260 --> 55:58.060]  building in advance of this actual collapse I don't know that I haven't
[55:58.060 --> 56:01.540]  heard that one I mean the BBC is a big organization I suppose it's possible I'm
[56:01.540 --> 56:13.140]  surprised I haven't heard it because I mean we we've seen footage of yourself
[56:13.140 --> 56:19.700]  reporting the collapse of that building and that has been time coded as 23
[56:19.700 --> 56:25.180]  minutes in advance all right stop right there now they cut the video of him
[56:25.180 --> 56:29.620]  reporting and he reported it over and over again that day let me think of how
[56:29.620 --> 56:33.520]  ashenine he's never heard a building 7 he's never heard a Solomon brothers
[56:33.520 --> 56:38.100]  building he didn't know he was there that day reporting it just continues from
[56:38.100 --> 56:48.460]  from here on out you may remember Jane Sandy yes yes I know yes I know she's a
[56:48.460 --> 56:56.100]  reporter that yeah on September 11th you were in BBC Water Studio yes and news came
[56:56.100 --> 57:02.580]  in I'm not I think you were the first of not the first but you said we're hearing
[57:02.580 --> 57:07.020]  reports now that the Salomon brothers building is collapsed you know I don't
[57:07.020 --> 57:11.500]  remember it though right my memory is not my strongest suit and there was so much
[57:11.500 --> 57:16.860]  going on I really don't remember the events yeah well basically this is
[57:16.860 --> 57:21.420]  got to talk to you because we don't we're not here to antagonize you but
[57:21.420 --> 57:26.940]  basically this building was a 47-story still structured building the Salomon
[57:26.940 --> 57:36.140]  brothers building and it collapsed roughly about 20 of 23 minutes past
[57:36.140 --> 57:43.460]  five New York time on September 11th and it contained it was I wasn't in the
[57:43.460 --> 57:49.020]  studio I'm sure that day I didn't I didn't go in no no I said I was in the
[57:49.020 --> 57:53.340]  theater in the afternoon and then we drove straight home and I came back for
[57:53.340 --> 57:57.300]  my shift the following day that's my recollection now more on the latest
[57:57.300 --> 58:00.780]  building collapse in New York you might have heard a few moments ago was
[58:00.780 --> 58:04.860]  talking about the Salomon brothers building collapsing and indeed it has
[58:04.860 --> 58:08.740]  apparently that's only a few hundred yards away from where the World Trade
[58:08.740 --> 58:13.620]  Centre towers were and it seems that this was not a result of a new attack it
[58:13.620 --> 58:18.140]  was because the building had been weakened during this morning's attacks
[58:18.140 --> 58:22.060]  we'll probably find out more now about that and in about I think it was about
[58:22.060 --> 58:30.460]  2006 it emerged this piece of footage emerged actually of you and James Dandy
[58:30.460 --> 58:40.160]  and a lot of people said thank you for listening to GCN be sure to visit GCN

[1:00:15.420 --> 1:00:20.740]  back into our number two Jim Mars coming up in the next segment finishing up
[1:00:20.740 --> 1:00:27.460]  now with Phil Hayden BBC news reporter news anchor reporting on the collapse
[1:00:27.460 --> 1:00:31.780]  of building seven before it happened 20 plus minutes before here is we are
[1:00:31.780 --> 1:00:38.660]  changed UK questioning them. Actually you and James Dandy a lot of people said hold
[1:00:38.660 --> 1:00:43.100]  on a minute in the video of Jane reporting the collapse of the building
[1:00:43.100 --> 1:00:47.820]  you can actually see the Salomon brothers building behind her. We'll probably find
[1:00:47.820 --> 1:00:52.020]  out more now about that from our correspondent Jane Stanley. Jane what
[1:00:52.020 --> 1:00:56.900]  more can you tell us about the Salomon brothers building and its collapse. As you
[1:00:56.900 --> 1:01:01.900]  can see behind me the trade center appears to be still burning we see these
[1:01:01.900 --> 1:01:08.260]  huge clouds of smoke and ash and we know that behind that there's an empty piece
[1:01:08.260 --> 1:01:13.820]  of what was a very familiar New York skyline a symbol of the financial
[1:01:13.820 --> 1:01:20.420]  prosperity of this city. Well this is all news to me I really I'm surprised. It
[1:01:20.420 --> 1:01:25.340]  would have been later I guess it would have been later for English time. Oh yeah
[1:01:25.340 --> 1:01:29.420]  now it's coming back to me of course because at that stage I wasn't doing the
[1:01:29.420 --> 1:01:33.980]  morning I was doing the evenings of the world so I yes I went with my son to the
[1:01:33.980 --> 1:01:37.860]  theater heard it on the radio and then went into the studio quite right yeah
[1:01:37.860 --> 1:01:43.620]  and I was on that night. Now we think our interpretation of it was
[1:01:43.620 --> 1:01:48.420]  because this is caused such a lot of controversy the editor of BBC World had
[1:01:48.420 --> 1:01:53.020]  to come out and make a public statement as to why it was that the BBC had
[1:01:53.020 --> 1:01:57.740]  reported on air the collapse of a building prior to its actual collapse
[1:01:57.740 --> 1:02:02.860]  and the second reason why it's so controversial is because to this day no
[1:02:02.860 --> 1:02:07.860]  scientist or engineer has been able to provide a plausible reason for this
[1:02:07.860 --> 1:02:12.020]  building's collapse and in fact the National Institute of Standards and
[1:02:12.020 --> 1:02:17.060]  Technology report states that even the most plausible scenario is highly
[1:02:17.060 --> 1:02:23.180]  unlikely so a lot of eyebrows were raised there was a demolition expert who
[1:02:23.180 --> 1:02:28.220]  looked at the building and said this is controlled demolition he looked at the
[1:02:28.220 --> 1:02:33.500]  collapse of World Trade Center 7 and said without doubt this is a controlled demolition.
[1:02:33.500 --> 1:02:42.500]  Do you see it going up today? No, it's going from below. It's going from below, right? Yes. They just blown away columns, so it's going to collapse.
[1:02:42.500 --> 1:02:48.500]  This is different than the World Trade Center. Don't you think so? Yes, you can see it going down first.
[1:02:48.500 --> 1:02:52.500]  Yes, and the rest just goes in. So this is controlled demolition.
[1:02:52.500 --> 1:02:57.500]  I know for sure. I know for sure. It's going to collapse.
[1:02:57.500 --> 1:03:04.500]  This has happened all the way up. It has killed 10 of the experts. But this also happened on 11 September.
[1:03:04.500 --> 1:03:10.500]  It's the same day. The same day. The same day. Do you know for sure? Yes.
[1:03:14.500 --> 1:03:21.500]  Was it definitely the 11th? Yes, it was. 7 o'clock after the World Trade Center went down.
[1:03:21.500 --> 1:03:31.500]  Did they work it out? It sounded so significant. I'm just amazed. I didn't know about this.
[1:03:31.500 --> 1:03:37.500]  If you like, we can supply you with material information about this.
[1:03:37.500 --> 1:03:45.500]  Because I think from your perspective it would be good to know about this.
[1:03:45.500 --> 1:03:57.500]  Because this is one of the anomalies of 9-11 and that event was so significant that it deserves further investigation.
[1:03:57.500 --> 1:04:06.500]  That's potentially very interesting. I'm sorry, I can't lighten you. I didn't realise. This is completely news to me.
[1:04:06.500 --> 1:04:09.500]  I don't know how it's passed me by, but it has.
[1:04:09.500 --> 1:04:16.500]  Could we send you some information on it by email? Yes, if you like. Is that alright? Really, for your benefit.
[1:04:24.500 --> 1:04:31.500]  Is there no official explanation? No, none at all. In fact the National Institute of Standards of Technology
[1:04:31.500 --> 1:04:38.500]  were due to publish a report in 2007 as to why the building collapsed. They've had to delay it until 2009.

[1:08:11.500 --> 1:08:21.500]  Thanks for watching.
[1:08:52.500 --> 1:08:56.500]  He looks like a kid who was caught, mama walks in and he got the purse open,
[1:08:56.500 --> 1:09:01.500]  pulling a $20 bill out of it. Not just the cookie jar.
[1:09:01.500 --> 1:09:11.500]  Or dad walks in and you've got the key to the liquor cabinet and you've got the Jack Daniels up to your mouth chugging it down.
[1:09:11.500 --> 1:09:15.500]  That actually happened to me once. My dad's like, you're 12 years old, what are you doing?
[1:09:15.500 --> 1:09:19.500]  My dad's not a big drinker, but he always had it for parties and stuff.
[1:09:19.500 --> 1:09:21.500]  It doesn't matter. I don't know why I'm telling these stories.
[1:09:21.500 --> 1:09:31.500]  The point here is that he looks like Sylvester the cat in Looney Tunes,
[1:09:31.500 --> 1:09:34.500]  whenever he's caught with a Tweety Bird in his mouth and there's feathers sticking out each side.
[1:09:34.500 --> 1:09:40.500]  We actually had a black and white cat named Sylvester and he jumped on top of the parakeet cage,
[1:09:40.500 --> 1:09:47.500]  knocked the cage down. The parakeet named Wyatt Earp got out and my mother caught the cat with the bird in its mouth
[1:09:47.500 --> 1:09:53.500]  and she got it away and the bird lived a few more years. The point is he actually had feathers sticking out of his mouth with the bird.
[1:09:53.500 --> 1:09:59.500]  Now I'm really digressing, but the point is, this is very suspicious here it is.
[1:09:59.500 --> 1:10:02.500]  Is there no official explanation?
[1:10:02.500 --> 1:10:12.500]  No, not at all. In fact, the National Institute of Standards of Technology were due to publish a report in 2007 as to why the building collapsed.
[1:10:12.500 --> 1:10:14.500]  They've had to delay it until 2009.
[1:10:14.500 --> 1:10:17.500]  What did the BBC statement say?
[1:10:17.500 --> 1:10:22.500]  The BBC statement, the editor's statement, which is online said...
[1:10:22.500 --> 1:10:24.500]  They've lost the tape.
[1:10:24.500 --> 1:10:26.500]  Yeah, they've lost the original footage.
[1:10:26.500 --> 1:10:34.500]  I sense that you think there's a conspiracy here, but you might be right.
[1:10:34.500 --> 1:10:39.500]  Okay, there's the end of that. Jim Mars, what do you think about them apples?
[1:10:39.500 --> 1:10:53.500]  Well, as time goes by, excuse me, more and more information is coming out that just totally solidifies the idea that 9-11 was an inside job.
[1:10:53.500 --> 1:11:01.500]  In fact, in my mind, the only question now is, was this an event that was allowed to happen like Pearl Harbor,
[1:11:01.500 --> 1:11:11.500]  or was this actually concocted and contrived and originated within our alphabet intelligence agencies,
[1:11:11.500 --> 1:11:16.500]  which of course have been connected to Al-Qaeda all along dating back to the 80s,
[1:11:16.500 --> 1:11:22.500]  where they brought in the Saudi Al-Qaeda members to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.
[1:11:22.500 --> 1:11:24.500]  And then the Serbs?
[1:11:24.500 --> 1:11:33.500]  Oh yeah, and then they allowed Al-Qaeda to do their drug running through Kosovo and then the Serbian problem,
[1:11:33.500 --> 1:11:40.500]  because they were using them to train the Kosovo Liberation Army, which was our side of the faction there.
[1:11:40.500 --> 1:11:44.500]  So, you know, you've heard the old line, once CIA, always CIA.
[1:11:44.500 --> 1:11:54.500]  So, I have seen nothing that proves to me that Al-Qaeda has actually ever been totally separated from our CIA.
[1:11:54.500 --> 1:12:03.500]  Of course, and then, as you well know, according to the official pronouncements of the perpetrators of 9-11,
[1:12:03.500 --> 1:12:08.500]  the vast majority of them were Saudi residents.
[1:12:08.500 --> 1:12:17.500]  And we all know and it's been well known and undisputed that the closest business and social friends to the Saudi Royals
[1:12:17.500 --> 1:12:21.500]  and to the Bin Laden family in particular was the Bush family.
[1:12:21.500 --> 1:12:28.500]  So, it's just a little bit too close for comfort for my taste.
[1:12:28.500 --> 1:12:37.500]  The sock puppet Zahari, number two Al-Qaeda, supposedly, who's got this incredible history of aiding the CIA.
[1:12:37.500 --> 1:12:44.500]  Let me just list some of these for people that are out there.
[1:12:44.500 --> 1:12:49.500]  If you go to prisonplanet.com, you can read the article that Paul wrote about this.
[1:12:49.500 --> 1:12:59.500]  Is this the neocon-friendly Al-Zahari, a different person of the real Al-Zahari who was reported to have been captured in Tehran in February of 2002?
[1:12:59.500 --> 1:13:05.500]  Is this the different Al-Zahari to the one reportedly captured near the Pakistan-Afghan border in 2004?
[1:13:05.500 --> 1:13:13.500]  Or is this the same Al-Zahari who, at the head of the Egyptian-Islamic Jihad, fought for the CIA in Bosnia?
[1:13:13.500 --> 1:13:21.500]  Is this the same Al-Zahari who, according to the January 2000 U.S. congressional testimony, was granted U.S. residents by the immigration and naturalization service,
[1:13:21.500 --> 1:13:26.500]  sometimes almost impossible for many legitimate migrants to obtain?
[1:13:26.500 --> 1:13:30.500]  And then it just goes on and on. Is this the same guy that did this? Is this the same guy that did that?
[1:13:30.500 --> 1:13:36.500]  Totally admitted to be U.S. government Al-Ciata, and he comes out last week and says,
[1:13:36.500 --> 1:13:43.500]  9-11 Truth basically works for Ahmed Dinajid, which is the previous propaganda that we all need to be arrested,
[1:13:43.500 --> 1:13:46.500]  and that we're working for foreign powers and undermining.
[1:13:46.500 --> 1:13:53.500]  And then the Intel Center puts out new videos of Al-Qaeda with Adam Gadot and the ADL chairman's son,
[1:13:53.500 --> 1:14:01.500]  grandson Adam Perlman, grandson with the same logo in the same video layer admitted to be completely fake.
[1:14:01.500 --> 1:14:03.500]  I mean, that's case closed right there, Jim.
[1:14:03.500 --> 1:14:10.500]  Yeah, absolutely right. And you've got to understand that Al-Qaeda translates as the base.
[1:14:10.500 --> 1:14:15.500]  A lot of people think that means references to their headquarters,
[1:14:15.500 --> 1:14:22.500]  but according to the information given by the British intelligence,
[1:14:22.500 --> 1:14:27.500]  it's the CIA computer base. That's what Al-Qaeda is,
[1:14:27.500 --> 1:14:32.500]  which means they can go in there and pull out any Arab mercenary they've got, give him any name they want.
[1:14:32.500 --> 1:14:36.500]  And, you know, he's just another terrorist to us.
[1:14:36.500 --> 1:14:46.500]  But I'll tell you, the one that we really need to concentrate on is Abu Zabidah, who was captured in Pakistan in 2002.
[1:14:46.500 --> 1:14:53.500]  And at that time, Ari Flasher, that was the White House press secretary, made a big deal out of his capture and said,
[1:14:53.500 --> 1:14:56.500]  by golly, we're going to make him talk. Well, they did.
[1:14:56.500 --> 1:14:58.500]  They tried torture, but it didn't work.
[1:14:58.500 --> 1:15:04.500]  But then they tricked him into thinking that they were sending these Saudi interrogators into him
[1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:07.500]  and thinking that would frighten him into talking.
[1:15:07.500 --> 1:15:15.500]  But when they showed up, when these U.S. Arab American special forces guys disguised as Saudi interrogators showed up,
[1:15:15.500 --> 1:15:18.500]  he was relieved and he said, thank goodness you guys are here.
[1:15:18.500 --> 1:15:27.500]  And he began to tell them that he was actually working for three Saudi princes and that his cutout was the Air Marshal Mirror of Pakistan.
[1:15:27.500 --> 1:15:36.500]  So in other words, Al-Qaeda was being ordered about and got their marching orders from Saudis,
[1:15:36.500 --> 1:15:40.500]  from these Saudi princes who are tied with the Bush family and the CIA.
[1:15:40.500 --> 1:15:42.500]  And so there's your connection right there.
[1:15:42.500 --> 1:15:47.500]  Yeah, let's be clear. This is like Russian dolls. For those that don't know what that is, it's the little oval dolls
[1:15:47.500 --> 1:15:50.500]  where there's a little bitty one and then a little bit bigger one, a little bit bigger one, a little bit bigger one.
[1:15:50.500 --> 1:15:52.500]  You know, 10, 15 of them.
[1:15:52.500 --> 1:15:55.500]  One inside one, which is inside another, inside another.
[1:15:55.500 --> 1:15:58.500]  And let's get into your new book just briefly.
[1:15:58.500 --> 1:16:00.500]  And I'm going to come back for the next 40 minutes.
[1:16:00.500 --> 1:16:03.500]  Anything you want to cover, Jim, because you're a cornucopia of knowledge.
[1:16:03.500 --> 1:16:10.500]  Of course, former Fort Worth Star Telegram crime reporter been working the JFK scene since it happened.
[1:16:10.500 --> 1:16:16.500]  Now, I've got a new book coming out that I'm going to carry and that I'm super excited because you've gone to new levels
[1:16:16.500 --> 1:16:19.500]  exposing the Bush crime family and the Nazi connection.
[1:16:19.500 --> 1:16:24.500]  And that's what leads me to this point because I'm going to be exploring this the next few weeks on air.
[1:16:24.500 --> 1:16:26.500]  The new world order is like Eskimo art.
[1:16:26.500 --> 1:16:29.500]  For those that don't know what a new art looks like, I think it's really beautiful.
[1:16:29.500 --> 1:16:31.500]  You look at it one direction, it's a killer whale.
[1:16:31.500 --> 1:16:33.500]  Another direction, it's a bear.
[1:16:33.500 --> 1:16:35.500]  Another direction, it's a child.
[1:16:35.500 --> 1:16:38.500]  Another direction, it's a wolf, a husky,
[1:16:38.500 --> 1:16:41.500]  a caribou.
[1:16:41.500 --> 1:16:46.500]  I mean, I've got some a new art my folks have got when they're up in Alaska that's just it's gorgeous.
[1:16:46.500 --> 1:16:51.500]  And every way you turn it, it looks like something else by design.
[1:16:51.500 --> 1:16:53.500]  And that's what I find with the new world order.
[1:16:53.500 --> 1:16:58.500]  I mean, you can look at it from the angle of Zionists from the whole thing and they are in every level and facet.
[1:16:58.500 --> 1:17:01.500]  Or you can look at it as Catholics run it all and they're in every level and facet.
[1:17:01.500 --> 1:17:05.500]  Or you can look at it as it's Protestants and they're in every level and facet.
[1:17:05.500 --> 1:17:09.500]  Or you can look at it as British in every level and facet or it's German in every level and facet.
[1:17:09.500 --> 1:17:15.500]  But I mean, how do you, but at the top, it's all a select group through compartmentalization,
[1:17:15.500 --> 1:17:19.500]  through the Russian dolls, you know, through that system within system within system.
[1:17:19.500 --> 1:17:25.500]  And that's what gives them almost invincibility is because the public still looks at things as one group or another.
[1:17:25.500 --> 1:17:34.500]  And I think it's their key cloaking device or camouflage that they run through all the groups.
[1:17:34.500 --> 1:17:43.500]  Absolutely. Well, what it comes back to is Illuminati theology and practice.
[1:17:43.500 --> 1:17:51.500]  Now, whether the Illuminati exist as such is debatable, but their philosophy has certainly lived on.
[1:17:51.500 --> 1:18:00.500]  And basically it's the end justifies the means, which means you can lie, cheat, steal, kill.
[1:18:00.500 --> 1:18:04.500]  You can do anything if it will achieve your purpose.
[1:18:04.500 --> 1:18:13.500]  And the people who are at the heart of the ruling wealthy elite that are trying to get total chokehold on this planet
[1:18:13.500 --> 1:18:17.500]  certainly adhere to the Illuminati doctrine.
[1:18:17.500 --> 1:18:22.500]  And that's why that you'll find them posing as communists, you'll find them posing as capitalists,
[1:18:22.500 --> 1:18:28.500]  you'll find them posing as Republicans, you'll find them posing as Democrats, liberals, conservatives.
[1:18:28.500 --> 1:18:34.500]  Anything, anything to keep their opponents off balance.
[1:18:34.500 --> 1:18:38.500]  But the way to discover them is they'll put out rhetoric one way,
[1:18:38.500 --> 1:18:43.500]  but always push the new world order centralization, break up the family agenda.
[1:18:43.500 --> 1:18:46.500]  People then say, well, who do we know who's good and who's bad?
[1:18:46.500 --> 1:18:51.500]  Anybody who's against the new world order policies across the board, that's who you can trust.
[1:18:51.500 --> 1:18:54.500]  Anybody who's got more than a five year track record too.
[1:18:54.500 --> 1:18:57.500]  Jim, haven't you found they always blow their cover within about five years?
[1:18:57.500 --> 1:18:59.500]  Oh yeah, I usually center in that.
[1:18:59.500 --> 1:19:04.500]  And you know, I guess the classic example is President George W. Bush.
[1:19:04.500 --> 1:19:07.500]  Early on, he was the neo-conservative.
[1:19:07.500 --> 1:19:16.500]  He's the conservatives, he's the Republican, which has always stood for lesser government, decentralized government, balanced budgets.
[1:19:16.500 --> 1:19:19.500]  And he said all the right things and he belonged to the right party.
[1:19:19.500 --> 1:19:22.500]  And yet he didn't do any of that.
[1:19:22.500 --> 1:19:27.500]  We now have the highest deficits ever, we have more centralized government than ever.
[1:19:27.500 --> 1:19:31.500]  He's done the exact opposite of everything he's ever said he's stood for.
[1:19:31.500 --> 1:19:35.500]  JimMars.com is the website links up on infowars.com to his site.
[1:19:35.500 --> 1:19:40.500]  When we come back, Jim, let's get your take on the three Stooges, the three puppets.
[1:19:40.500 --> 1:19:44.500]  Really no difference between any of them.
[1:19:44.500 --> 1:19:47.500]  And we'll get your take on where this election is going on the other side.
[1:19:47.500 --> 1:19:50.500]  Jim Mars is our guest.
[1:19:50.500 --> 1:19:55.500]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:19:55.500 --> 1:20:00.500]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:20:00.500 --> 1:20:02.500]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[1:20:02.500 --> 1:20:05.500]  Could their objective be world domination?
[1:20:05.500 --> 1:20:08.500]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:20:08.500 --> 1:20:16.500]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:20:16.500 --> 1:20:24.500]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:20:24.500 --> 1:20:28.500]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:20:28.500 --> 1:20:31.500]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:20:31.500 --> 1:20:34.500]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need.
[1:20:34.500 --> 1:20:36.500]  They're after power, that's their affidavit.

[1:20:50.500 --> 1:20:56.500]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment.
[1:20:56.500 --> 1:21:01.500]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet and lack of exercise.
[1:21:01.500 --> 1:21:06.500]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of disease.
[1:21:06.500 --> 1:21:12.500]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity and loss of weight.
[1:21:12.500 --> 1:21:18.500]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[1:21:18.500 --> 1:21:22.500]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[1:21:22.500 --> 1:21:27.500]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[1:21:27.500 --> 1:21:30.500]  Do your part, alkalize and supercharge your body now.

[1:24:11.500 --> 1:24:19.500]  Two years ago, the Bilderberg Group, we got the leak that they were going to have oil at $200 a barrel in three years.
[1:24:19.500 --> 1:24:25.500]  That gives them about a year to get that job done, and here is the AP headline today.
[1:24:25.500 --> 1:24:33.500]  OPEC President Sees $200 Oil for Barrel. That's actually out of Reuters.
[1:24:33.500 --> 1:24:38.500]  Warren Buffett says recession may be worse than feared. This is all a shearing process.
[1:24:38.500 --> 1:24:43.500]  Jim Mars, your analysis on what's happening with this three-way race.
[1:24:43.500 --> 1:24:46.500]  I mean, no doubt all three candidates are owned by the same people.
[1:24:46.500 --> 1:24:51.500]  Who do you think they're gunning to put in, or does it even matter?
[1:24:51.500 --> 1:25:02.500]  Well, we only have one true choice in this election, because Barack Obama, his chief advisor, is Zygmanu Brzezinski and his son,
[1:25:02.500 --> 1:25:09.500]  the bilateral commission, New World Order. Behind Hillary Clinton, of course, is the Bilderbergers, New World Order,
[1:25:09.500 --> 1:25:15.500]  and the Council on Foreign Relations members, and behind John McCain is Henry Kissinger, for God's sake,
[1:25:15.500 --> 1:25:20.500]  the architect of our foreign policy, which has gotten us into the mess that we're in today.
[1:25:20.500 --> 1:25:27.500]  So, the only true choice in this election is to vote for either one of those three,
[1:25:27.500 --> 1:25:32.500]  in which case you get the New World Order in the North American Union, more loss of liberty,
[1:25:32.500 --> 1:25:41.500]  more chipping and computerized surveillance, or you can vote for Ron Paul, who's still in the running,
[1:25:41.500 --> 1:25:51.500]  and who is actually talking about what most Americans would agree to, which is enforcing the immigration laws,
[1:25:51.500 --> 1:26:01.500]  enforcing the barter laws, looking and investigating the Federal Reserve system, which is a private banking system,
[1:26:01.500 --> 1:26:12.500]  and less interference with government and using our military for its original design purpose, which is to defend the country.
[1:26:12.500 --> 1:26:21.500]  But, of course, nobody gets to hear this because the New World Order people own and control the five corporations
[1:26:21.500 --> 1:26:29.500]  that control the media. And when I say media, it's not just the news. Alex, as you well know,
[1:26:29.500 --> 1:26:37.500]  they control publishing, billboards, magazines, CDs, music, you name it, it's all controlled by one of these five corporations.
[1:26:37.500 --> 1:26:44.500]  And if you wonder about unification, an example of that is the NFL, you know, all the supposed conservative mainline things,
[1:26:44.500 --> 1:26:52.500]  pushing global warming, pushing global taxes, pushing, you know, this world system, they know what they're doing,
[1:26:52.500 --> 1:26:58.500]  and they are unified. You know, I'm worried if Barack Obama gets elected that they're going to kill him,
[1:26:58.500 --> 1:27:03.500]  and then you're going to have riots all over this country, which they'll use as an excuse to bring in martial law.
[1:27:03.500 --> 1:27:10.500]  McCain is totally insane, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, I ran. And what Newt Gennrich said two years ago,
[1:27:10.500 --> 1:27:15.500]  about a year and a half ago, what others have said, is it's going to be a Hillary slash Obama ticket,
[1:27:15.500 --> 1:27:22.500]  and that, you know, of course he's evil, CFR, a Bilderberg group as well, but they like to brag beforehand,
[1:27:22.500 --> 1:27:28.500]  and that's what I see happening, and I've always said Hillary, even though people have always thought it was going to be Obama,
[1:27:28.500 --> 1:27:34.500]  and maybe I'm going to be wrong, but that's what the insiders have said, and notice she just keeps hanging in there,
[1:27:34.500 --> 1:27:42.500]  or Obama gets in and they kill him. I know he's New World Order, but still, folks, it's just, the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
[1:27:42.500 --> 1:27:47.500]  And of course Hillary and Obama want socialized health care, which is the government controlling your health care
[1:27:47.500 --> 1:27:52.500]  and making you take drugs, making you take injections. People who are for socialized health care don't think of that.
[1:27:52.500 --> 1:28:01.500]  You know, Hitler had socialized health care, but McCain is even leaning towards more taxes and socialized health care,
[1:28:01.500 --> 1:28:09.500]  but that's the only one plus for McCain, is that he at least has not openly said he wants socialized health care.
[1:28:09.500 --> 1:28:20.500]  Well, yeah, but here's, am I the only one that's concerned that if McCain gets elected, that we have a president with his finger on the nuclear trigger,
[1:28:20.500 --> 1:28:27.500]  who for five and a half years was in the hands of Soviet man control experts.
[1:28:27.500 --> 1:28:35.500]  Talk about your Manchurian candidate, you know, by his own admission. While he was captive, they worked on him.
[1:28:35.500 --> 1:28:40.500]  He told him secrets. He told him military secrets. He gave up everything.
[1:28:40.500 --> 1:28:51.500]  And the story that strikes me, Alex, is I don't know if you saw this, there was an article in the Florida newspaper where they were interviewing a former Castro journalist
[1:28:51.500 --> 1:29:02.500]  who during Vietnam had gone over to Hanoi and decided he wanted to interview the son of the admiral that was in charge over there, John McCain.
[1:29:02.500 --> 1:29:12.500]  And so he conducted the interview with John McCain. But according to this story, the interview was not conducted in the Hanoi Hilton, the prison.
[1:29:12.500 --> 1:29:19.500]  It was conducted in a lavish downtown hotel. So McCain was getting some extraordinary treatment there.
[1:29:19.500 --> 1:29:27.500]  And according to the documents now coming out of the old Soviet Union, they sent Russian man control experts.
[1:29:27.500 --> 1:29:33.500]  Stay there. Stay there. Let's come back and talk about the Manchurian candidate. Oh, I would never vote for McCain. I'm not saying he's good.
[1:29:33.500 --> 1:29:58.500]  They're all evil. We'll be right back.
[1:30:03.500 --> 1:30:10.500]  And how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days. The package contains six DVDs that contain ten different programs.

[1:33:15.500 --> 1:33:28.500]  We're going to have Tex Mars in studio this week. For prisonplanet.tv members you'll be able to watch live on this radio show. It transfers into a television show in the fourth hour.
[1:33:28.500 --> 1:33:44.500]  We have a guest in studio with an archive. The multi-camera shoot, the document cam, the computer cam, the video feed cam, the guest cam, the cams on me. All mixed together in an hour to two hour video file that we post after the live show for your viewing ease.
[1:33:44.500 --> 1:33:59.500]  And so you can spread it out to people.
[1:33:59.500 --> 1:34:14.500]  It's been around more than four years now. Four years at the start of this month. Four years and twenty-something days. Then it's been pretty good in the past. All my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV shows and studio interviews. Now we're adding, take in game.
[1:34:14.500 --> 1:34:24.500]  You got an hour and forty minutes of extras that weren't on the DVD. In game 1.5. Stuff like the Japanese interviewing me. We set up a camera, taped that, put it up, you get behind the scenes stuff.
[1:34:24.500 --> 1:34:36.500]  Prisonplanet.tv. We now have two CDNs, content distribution networks. So you can get our videos at four times T1 speeds if you've got the connections. You can download them in almost DVD quality.
[1:34:36.500 --> 1:34:47.500]  We're going to add a facet soon. We're going to upload them in DVD quality. I just got to hire a whole other person just to do all that because it takes so long to encode those and upload them and do them that way.
[1:34:47.500 --> 1:35:00.500]  But they're already super good. So prisonplanet.tv, ladies and gentlemen. Also, in the fourth hour, a lot of times don't even do the commercials myself. We still run those out over the network.
[1:35:00.500 --> 1:35:06.500]  And I do behind the scenes stuff during the breaks here. So it's even more of a reason to be a prisonplanet.tv member.
[1:35:06.500 --> 1:35:19.500]  By the way, a couple loose ends here and I'm going to create a frequently asked questions section on info wars.com and just direct people there. I keep meaning to do this. We need to.
[1:35:19.500 --> 1:35:24.500]  I just again have a limited staff, but we need to do it frequently asked questions.
[1:35:24.500 --> 1:35:31.500]  I get emails all the time. One of my friends in New York was asking about it last night. So it must be an issue.
[1:35:31.500 --> 1:35:45.500]  It was, Hey, why do you have a John McCain ad on your website? Or why do you have an Army National Guard thing on your website? Or why do you have a Hillary thing on your website or some law enforcement college thing?
[1:35:45.500 --> 1:35:58.500]  Here's the problem. When you accept Google ads, they put what they want on your site. Now you can go in and pre block things, but you can't think of it all.
[1:35:58.500 --> 1:36:05.500]  I mean, who would think that Hillary would advertise? Who would think that McCain would advertise? Well, they just buy giant packages on thousands of websites.
[1:36:05.500 --> 1:36:11.500]  Who would think that? Let me think of something else that's been real bad.
[1:36:11.500 --> 1:36:30.500]  You in or Bill Clinton and the George Bush senior in the hurricane relief fund, who would think that? And so we can't imagine all the websites that are out there. So we have to ban URLs and then Kurt Nemo has to go in and ban those.
[1:36:30.500 --> 1:36:37.500]  And then he has to call me and ask, do you want me to ban this too? That's why I'm telling Kurt now on air. Just ban whatever you don't like her here. How's that sound?
[1:36:37.500 --> 1:36:49.500]  I've also told Watson that. I mean, I got people that put ads on my website to buy my DVDs on eBay for a dollar a piece on my website. I'm not putting that up there. I have to go ban them.
[1:36:49.500 --> 1:37:00.500]  You understand? So you imagine my, especially all the new listeners we have that aren't that sophisticated yet. They go see that and there's no way to.
[1:37:00.500 --> 1:37:10.500]  The problem is, if I get rid of my Google ads, I'll have to close a website down. I mean, we're not. We need the capital from that. We have to wait till something goes up to then take it off.
[1:37:10.500 --> 1:37:21.500]  And there's also people that detract on the comment sections on the sites, which we don't censor. So people get in there and say, look, he's taking Google or he's taking McCain ads. He's under their control.
[1:37:21.500 --> 1:37:31.500]  And then I can even comment in there. No, no, that's Google ads. Shut up, liar. Shut up, Jesuit. You know, we all know you're a knight to Malta. I'm like, nobody in my family is Catholic. I'm not.
[1:37:31.500 --> 1:37:39.500]  Shut up. We have proof. Well, what's the proof? Shut up, devil. Or, you know, whatever the thing is, again, it's an illness, a mass illness.
[1:37:39.500 --> 1:37:54.500]  The same thing goes for that. I work for ABC. We have posted links to ABC star guide three where you can call and rent a feed yourself. Just like you can call AT&T and get a cell phone.
[1:37:54.500 --> 1:38:02.500]  And we rent one. That's how you're on radio. That's how the radio signal gets to the receivers in the radio stations.
[1:38:02.500 --> 1:38:11.500]  The biggest thing was ABC news till a few years ago. You may have to get another satellite, actually. And now it's like Fox, but they won't lease feeds.
[1:38:11.500 --> 1:38:21.500]  It's Fox radio news. You have to go lease one from them. There was actually lawsuits over a decade ago against big telecommunications giants because they wouldn't lease people feeds.
[1:38:21.500 --> 1:38:27.500]  You have to. They had to be sued, not ABC, but another company. You can buy it from Jones.
[1:38:27.500 --> 1:38:35.500]  What's the other name? Clear Channel or ABC. That's the three star guide satellites. I don't know how else to explain this to you.
[1:38:35.500 --> 1:38:47.500]  But again, our detractors know that they take that and they twist that deceptively and say that we are owned and run by ABC, which is you could go to Minnesota and go look at Midas Resources Inc.
[1:38:47.500 --> 1:38:57.500]  The corporation, it's not. There's a Genesis porno magazine. People say that we are owned by that. It's not true.
[1:38:57.500 --> 1:39:12.500]  I didn't mean to digress, Jim. It's not that I don't like being criticized. I really don't care. It's that so much of our movement spends its time talking about little side issues they can't prove instead of the elephant running over us that's in our face.
[1:39:12.500 --> 1:39:25.500]  Well, what's interesting to me is most of those communications satellites have all been paid for by us to begin with. There was a New York company that was putting up 33 satellites or whatever.
[1:39:25.500 --> 1:39:27.500]  I read him.
[1:39:27.500 --> 1:39:34.500]  Using government contracts and then declared bankruptcy or went broke or whatever, turned them all over to the government.
[1:39:34.500 --> 1:39:41.500]  And now the government tells us what controls what goes on those feeds.
[1:39:41.500 --> 1:39:49.500]  But, I mean, the COINTELPRO, and they're not all COINTELPRO, some aren't, but the stuff they do, the way they manipulate.
[1:39:49.500 --> 1:39:59.500]  And again, it's not about me being criticized. It's that our movement spends so much of its time nitting or talking about who they like or who the best is.
[1:39:59.500 --> 1:40:07.500]  This is not a beauty pageant. This is a red level crisis. We're in the front line ditches here.
[1:40:07.500 --> 1:40:18.500]  Right. And it's coming to an apex. Pretty quickly, it's going to be, do we all go to our knees or do we stand up for freedom?
[1:40:18.500 --> 1:40:24.500]  Jim, what are the subjects in the time we've got left you think are most important? Before you leave, I want you to give us a little hint.
[1:40:24.500 --> 1:40:32.500]  Because this is Bombshell, a major publisher about the Nazi element, the occultic Germanic death cult nature of all of this.
[1:40:32.500 --> 1:40:38.500]  But before we do that, what, I mean, right now, what is most important on Jim Mars's mind?
[1:40:38.500 --> 1:40:51.500]  I think what's most important is to not become trapped in the matrix woven by the electronic media to where all you can think about in debate is,
[1:40:51.500 --> 1:40:57.500]  Obama said that, and Hillary said this, and they countered with this, and they did that. That's just distraction.
[1:40:57.500 --> 1:41:04.500]  Yes. Again, the people behind the curtain, the people that are really running the show, they control all three of the major candidates,
[1:41:04.500 --> 1:41:13.500]  and there are other candidates, but you never hear about them. That is control over the media and over the information.
[1:41:13.500 --> 1:41:23.500]  Well, I agree with you. I liken it to World War II, where they put out fake tanks and blow up, you know, jeeps and things to fool the enemy about troop movements.
[1:41:23.500 --> 1:41:29.500]  That's all Hillary, Obama and Bush are, is their decoys out there to get everybody to focus on it.
[1:41:29.500 --> 1:41:36.500]  Distractions. That's just distractions. What we need to be concentrating on, and if there was a real news media,
[1:41:36.500 --> 1:41:45.500]  they would be focusing on this, and instead of day-to-day headlines about some celebrity or sports event or whatever,
[1:41:45.500 --> 1:41:53.500]  which is all fine and good, but there needs to be a concentration on real news, and that has to do with government concentration,
[1:41:53.500 --> 1:41:57.500]  the immense power of the pharmaceutical corporations.
[1:41:57.500 --> 1:42:05.500]  In fact, according to the Center for Public Integrity, Osama bin Laden and Hillary Clinton both are the largest recipients of campaign contributions
[1:42:05.500 --> 1:42:15.500]  from the pharmaceutical corporations. No wonder they're talking about a national health care plan that will require you to buy all of these drugs
[1:42:15.500 --> 1:42:25.500]  that the big farm is putting out, and when you go back and look, and this will be covered in some detail in my new book that's coming out at the end of June,
[1:42:25.500 --> 1:42:32.500]  you have to go back and look at the Nazi origins of these pharmaceutical corporations.
[1:42:32.500 --> 1:42:35.500]  It's amazing.
[1:42:35.500 --> 1:42:41.500]  And that's another story there. This is one of the biggest stories not going reported.
[1:42:41.500 --> 1:42:49.500]  One of the things that most people in America today are truly concerned about are these school shootings and teen suicides.
[1:42:49.500 --> 1:42:58.500]  There's always some big hurrah every time something like that happens, and yet they talk about guns and they talk about the educational standards,
[1:42:58.500 --> 1:43:05.500]  and they talk about everything except the true cause, which is psychotropic drugs.
[1:43:05.500 --> 1:43:13.500]  Well, I mean, I've never seen a case where a woman chops off her baby's arms or drives them into a river or you have a mass shooter.
[1:43:13.500 --> 1:43:20.500]  They're always into weird death cults, God. They're always on Prozac or a mixture of serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[1:43:20.500 --> 1:43:30.500]  They always shoot them up video game obsessions. They almost always have a dad who's an Air Force mind control or a NASA mind linguistics.
[1:43:30.500 --> 1:43:37.500]  In fact, I interrupted you with the break. Go back to McCain and mind control, then let's get into mind control.
[1:43:37.500 --> 1:43:44.500]  Well, mind control, you can accomplish that with several different methods. You can use drugs. You can use other chemicals.
[1:43:44.500 --> 1:43:53.500]  You can use electronics. You know, the brain operates on radio frequencies, electromagnetic frequencies.
[1:43:53.500 --> 1:44:05.500]  And to give you a somewhat simplistic example is if you attach electrodes to a rat's brain and put him in the same cage with a cat,
[1:44:05.500 --> 1:44:15.500]  he's going to freak out and they can actually read, measure these brain waves, then they can turn around and broadcast those same frequencies to an individual
[1:44:15.500 --> 1:44:24.500]  or to whole groups of people, whole populations. And it's not, doesn't mean that everybody's just going to suddenly go screaming down the street in absolute fear,
[1:44:24.500 --> 1:44:31.500]  but it works on them. It works on it. Just kind of, you know, you go around and pretty soon you're feeling depressed and you're feeling agitated.
[1:44:31.500 --> 1:44:36.500]  And I mean, this is going on. It's not like it's not happening.
[1:44:36.500 --> 1:44:42.500]  Well, it's, it's in every case because it, it's those drugs are listed in the psychotropic family.
[1:44:42.500 --> 1:44:48.500]  Right. And so these people are literally in a mesmerized sleeping, sleepwalking state. They're brainwaves.
[1:44:48.500 --> 1:44:55.500]  When you're on this, you're in a sleepwalking state. And then that opens them up for suggestion. They're playing shoot them up games.
[1:44:55.500 --> 1:45:02.500]  They're in a violent culture. It's been introduced into their minds that what do you do when you're upset and when you're sad?
[1:45:02.500 --> 1:45:09.500]  You commit suicide. Federal studies admit that when the fed started death education starting in Littleton, Colorado in 1990,
[1:45:09.500 --> 1:45:17.500]  there was a frontline special on it. There was also a 2020 special on it that then they told the kids about suicide, how to commit suicide.
[1:45:17.500 --> 1:45:21.500]  Then that introduces the idea. It's, it's sick.
[1:45:21.500 --> 1:45:30.500]  Oh, it's absolutely unconscionable. And this, of course, coming from a person, when I was growing up, I get, when I was a kid,
[1:45:30.500 --> 1:45:35.500]  I guess the, the worst violence that I ever experienced was watching television.
[1:45:35.500 --> 1:45:41.500]  When we saw Hopalong Kasti shoot the gun out of the bad man's hand and he stands there holding his wrist.
[1:45:41.500 --> 1:45:49.500]  You know, that was about it. It's, and, and I'm not, of course, I'm, I'm lead the charge against censorship.
[1:45:49.500 --> 1:46:00.500]  But I think that we need to become a little bit more responsible as a society and quit exposing children to cartoons where they just, you know,
[1:46:00.500 --> 1:46:08.500]  they just kill each other and then on up to the teen years where the slasher and, and kill movies are so predominant.
[1:46:08.500 --> 1:46:14.500]  Well, if you look at the advent of television and the rise of violence, it follows on the exact same graph.
[1:46:14.500 --> 1:46:21.500]  Many, many university studies show this as you know. And the first paper targets in World War Two, even before World War Two,
[1:46:21.500 --> 1:46:24.500]  is because most soldiers up close wouldn't shoot another human being.
[1:46:24.500 --> 1:46:32.500]  And they went from 80% not shooting to half shooting by Vietnam to like 80% would kill somebody up close to now almost 100%.
[1:46:32.500 --> 1:46:40.500]  And they have instinctive, they've instinctivized the shooting, the dehumanization, the instinctive shooting to where now the,
[1:46:40.500 --> 1:46:46.500]  the first video games were to habitualize killing people up close. And now it's been done.
[1:46:46.500 --> 1:46:55.500]  And that's what tasers are. I saw non-lethal weapon documents 20, from 20 years ago about how they would train people to use a non-lethal
[1:46:55.500 --> 1:46:59.500]  to actually get the public and the police ready for the police to just shoot us in mass.
[1:46:59.500 --> 1:47:05.500]  You see, the taser is only a training aid for cops actually mowing us down with lead. Go ahead.
[1:47:05.500 --> 1:47:15.500]  Well, you're absolutely right. In fact, the taser has been sold as a non-lethal weapon, which only encourages the users, law enforcement or otherwise,
[1:47:15.500 --> 1:47:20.500]  to, you know, well, I'm not going to kill him, so they're a lot more likely to use it.
[1:47:20.500 --> 1:47:26.500]  Well, non-lethal weapons in their original name were semi-lethal or less lethal.
[1:47:26.500 --> 1:47:34.500]  Just like SWAT teams, when Daryl Gates founded it with the CIA in the 60s in LA, were called special weapons attack teams.
[1:47:34.500 --> 1:47:46.500]  And that's what they are. Speaking of the devil, all over the nation, the local police, Chicago, just served out many 14s and 30-caliber carbines
[1:47:46.500 --> 1:47:51.500]  to every member of the force saying, quote, they're getting ready for gang wars.
[1:47:51.500 --> 1:47:56.500]  The entire attack profile of the government is to wage war on the people. Their own documents say it.
[1:47:56.500 --> 1:48:07.500]  And it said that major cities are turning their SWAT teams into hundreds, in some cases, into thousands. So now thousands of black scheme-esque bust down your door.
[1:48:07.500 --> 1:48:14.500]  That attack profile is not for terrorist or gangs. That is for the general public. They are really gearing up for martial law.
[1:48:14.500 --> 1:48:21.500]  Well, and I'll tell you what really shocked me, although it wasn't a surprise because I've been hearing this for years,
[1:48:21.500 --> 1:48:33.500]  was in recent exercises conducted in Memphis and two or three other cities, they combined local police with the military, with the BATF, with the FBI,
[1:48:33.500 --> 1:48:44.500]  and, according to mainstream media accounts, gangs, okay, were working with them on this anti-terrorism drill.
[1:48:44.500 --> 1:48:53.500]  So in other words, when a guy crashes in your door to take your weapons, it might not even be a trained and official member of the government.
[1:48:53.500 --> 1:48:56.500]  It could be a member of the Crips or the Bloods or one of these gangs.
[1:48:56.500 --> 1:49:04.500]  And I want to be clear, that's all mainstream news, aggravated felons, illegal aliens, and we're under martial law.
[1:49:04.500 --> 1:49:10.500]  When major cities are getting adult curfews, when the police are saying, let us see, we want to search for legal guns,
[1:49:10.500 --> 1:49:15.500]  when they're running checkpoints, when they're violating the Bill of Rights, that is martial law.
[1:49:15.500 --> 1:49:22.500]  People keep saying, Alex, you say martial law is coming. We are being incrementally, I've always said this, red dawn slow motion.
[1:49:22.500 --> 1:49:26.500]  I mean, Jim, is there any doubt that we are more and more entering into martial law?
[1:49:26.500 --> 1:49:34.500]  Well, there's really no question about it. A few months ago, I was in Los Angeles in late at night, and we're going down this main street,
[1:49:34.500 --> 1:49:42.500]  and exactly we turned off onto another street, but right up ahead there was all these flashing red lights and one of those lighted signs that said,
[1:49:42.500 --> 1:49:49.500]  police checkpoint, prepare to be searched and pull over here, and they had cones out, and they funneled everybody in,
[1:49:49.500 --> 1:49:53.500]  and they were stopping everybody, I guess, searching the cars, looking at everybody.
[1:49:53.500 --> 1:50:00.500]  And of course, when the mass media has done a wonderful job of instilling fear into everyone,
[1:50:00.500 --> 1:50:06.500]  then as far as I know, nobody was objecting. It's absolutely incredible.
[1:50:06.500 --> 1:50:13.500]  And then we have this spectacle here in Texas of where they have taken almost 500 kids away from their parents,
[1:50:13.500 --> 1:50:22.500]  because they didn't like their religious practices and had raided their living space.
[1:50:22.500 --> 1:50:27.500]  Stay there. I want to get your take on this when we get back, and then keep you five over in the next hour,
[1:50:27.500 --> 1:50:34.500]  more than Steve Quels joining us, because, yeah, if they've got evidence of crimes individually,
[1:50:34.500 --> 1:50:39.500]  when a few of those kids do something about it, but take hundreds of children without due process
[1:50:39.500 --> 1:50:44.500]  and give them to a government that statistically abuses children five times more often than anybody in their group,
[1:50:44.500 --> 1:50:47.500]  you know, they're saying they're taking all the kids because this is a bad group.
[1:50:47.500 --> 1:50:50.500]  What about the government? You're the worst group. You're scum.
[1:50:50.500 --> 1:50:57.500]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[1:50:57.500 --> 1:50:59.500]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[1:50:59.500 --> 1:51:02.500]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:51:02.500 --> 1:51:08.500]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[1:51:08.500 --> 1:51:12.500]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[1:51:12.500 --> 1:51:17.500]  In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[1:52:50.500 --> 1:52:53.500]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[1:52:53.500 --> 1:53:00.500]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[1:53:00.500 --> 1:53:04.500]  For the last three years, the earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce,
[1:53:04.500 --> 1:53:09.500]  and it has now finally caught up with us, and the U.S. commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed
[1:53:09.500 --> 1:53:13.500]  and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[1:53:13.500 --> 1:53:20.500]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[1:53:20.500 --> 1:53:22.500]  Remember our trade deficit?
[1:53:22.500 --> 1:53:28.500]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[1:53:28.500 --> 1:53:34.500]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law.
[1:53:34.500 --> 1:53:39.500]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202.
[1:53:39.500 --> 1:53:47.500]  1-800-453-2202 or visit us at www.readyreservefoods.com.
[1:53:47.500 --> 1:54:02.500]  1-800-453-2202.
[1:54:02.500 --> 1:54:09.500]  You know, we're hearing a lot of talk about martial law.
[1:54:09.500 --> 1:54:18.500]  I wrote a story with that homin' ten years ago called Martial Law is Here, and it's a three on the Richter scale.
[1:54:18.500 --> 1:54:22.500]  And I explained that it was an incremental martial law.
[1:54:22.500 --> 1:54:27.500]  Yeah, they're handing out assault rifles, all the police across the country.
[1:54:27.500 --> 1:54:31.500]  Yeah, they're training them, and now they're saying for martial law.
[1:54:31.500 --> 1:54:36.500]  But does that mean army tanks rolling around the streets and mass arrest and no food?
[1:54:36.500 --> 1:54:40.500]  I'm not going to say that. You know, there's a lot of people coming out and saying that.
[1:54:40.500 --> 1:54:46.500]  With the economy and so much trouble, there are some food shortages around the world, but most of us are obese.
[1:54:46.500 --> 1:54:49.500]  It's going to be tough on the third world, but they'll make it.
[1:54:49.500 --> 1:54:52.500]  Food prices are certainly going to go way up.
[1:54:52.500 --> 1:55:01.500]  But I also want to be careful, Jim, because it was the establishment, the Navy, who put out the Y2K report.
[1:55:01.500 --> 1:55:04.500]  They said 69 cities wouldn't have power or total collapse.
[1:55:04.500 --> 1:55:07.500]  And then about three months before, they suddenly said, no, everything's fine.
[1:55:07.500 --> 1:55:09.500]  These kooks say it's going to be bad.
[1:55:09.500 --> 1:55:16.500]  And when we got set up with that, then they used that to put their emergency management centers in their fusion centers.
[1:55:16.500 --> 1:55:21.500]  They used that to federalize the cities, and then they started it, the hoax.
[1:55:21.500 --> 1:55:25.500]  And then it didn't happen like that. And I figured that out by the end.
[1:55:25.500 --> 1:55:30.500]  But the point is, is that I also want to point out that they do this stuff incrementally.
[1:55:30.500 --> 1:55:35.500]  And so people who are looking for it just to all to happen in one day, I think are missing the boat.
[1:55:35.500 --> 1:55:39.500]  I mean, take our economy. It's a slow slide into third world.
[1:55:39.500 --> 1:55:41.500]  And what's your take, Jim Mars?
[1:55:41.500 --> 1:55:44.500]  Absolutely. That's what's going on.
[1:55:44.500 --> 1:55:51.500]  And of course, I guess my problem is that I've lived too long because I can remember what life was like in the old republic.
[1:55:51.500 --> 1:56:01.500]  But you have to understand that at the very top, the people who control the five corporations that control everything we see in here,
[1:56:01.500 --> 1:56:09.500]  they control the banking system and control the stock market so they can run stocks up and down or whatever.
[1:56:09.500 --> 1:56:14.500]  These people might be authoritarian. They might be murderous even, but they're not stupid.
[1:56:14.500 --> 1:56:23.500]  They have access to the think tanks and to the foundations that have their finger on the pulse of the life of the nation.
[1:56:23.500 --> 1:56:29.500]  And they know exactly what to do to pull our chains and get us to go along with stuff.
[1:56:29.500 --> 1:56:36.500]  When Bush first took office, gasoline was like $1.5 a gallon or less.
[1:56:36.500 --> 1:56:46.500]  And he's the one who supposedly represents less government, less control, freewheeling capitalism.
[1:56:46.500 --> 1:56:49.500]  And yet, look where gasoline prices are today.
[1:56:49.500 --> 1:56:58.500]  If they had jumped from $1.5 to $3.95, there would be a nationwide revolution.
[1:56:58.500 --> 1:57:07.500]  But they've just eased it up at the same time telling us we have to tighten the belt because we're in a World War II situation with the terrorists,
[1:57:07.500 --> 1:57:15.500]  whoever they are, with no capital, no territory to gain, no objective to get in our hands.
[1:57:15.500 --> 1:57:25.500]  It's just an ongoing, fear-mongering tactic to just allow them to run rampant with their corporate business practices.
[1:57:25.500 --> 1:57:37.500]  And when you put that all together and you find out that they are at the same time pushing social programs, education, the old folks,
[1:57:37.500 --> 1:57:40.500]  social security, you know, they push it.
[1:57:40.500 --> 1:57:48.500]  We are obviously now into a socialistic society and it's being propelled by nationalism.
[1:57:48.500 --> 1:57:56.500]  Oh, well, we're in a war on terrorism, we have to protect the country and our country's right or wrong and we're going to bring freedom and democracy to the rest of the world.
[1:57:56.500 --> 1:57:58.500]  So you put those together and what have you got?
[1:57:58.500 --> 1:58:01.500]  National socialism, okay?
[1:58:01.500 --> 1:58:04.500]  And what's the acronym for national socialism?
[1:58:04.500 --> 1:58:05.500]  Nazi.
[1:58:05.500 --> 1:58:07.500]  And there you have it.
[1:58:07.500 --> 1:58:10.500]  It's right in our face, but it's just like you well know it.
[1:58:10.500 --> 1:58:15.500]  Alex, their favorite trick is to put everything just kind of in the open.
[1:58:15.500 --> 1:58:19.500]  But they have us look at it from a different viewpoint.
[1:58:19.500 --> 1:58:20.500]  Stay there.
[1:58:20.500 --> 1:58:21.500]  One more segment with Jim Mars.
[1:58:21.500 --> 1:58:24.500]  We'll give you his website and tell you about some of his latest books.
[1:58:24.500 --> 1:58:27.500]  Also just in chaos over Ron Paul, cut short gathering.
[1:58:27.500 --> 1:58:29.500]  Wait till you hear this.
[1:58:31.500 --> 1:58:33.500]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:36.500 --> 1:58:39.500]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:39.500 --> 1:58:43.500]  It is a big idea.
[1:58:43.500 --> 1:58:45.500]  A new world order.
[1:58:45.500 --> 1:58:50.500]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:58:50.500 --> 1:58:52.500]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[1:58:52.500 --> 1:58:55.500]  Could their objective be world domination?
[1:58:55.500 --> 1:58:58.500]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:58:58.500 --> 1:59:09.500]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:59:09.500 --> 1:59:14.500]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:59:14.500 --> 1:59:18.500]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:59:18.500 --> 1:59:21.500]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:59:21.500 --> 1:59:22.500]  Most people have no idea.
[1:59:22.500 --> 1:59:23.500]  They're not after money.
[1:59:23.500 --> 1:59:24.500]  They have all the money they need.
[1:59:24.500 --> 1:59:25.500]  They're after power.
[1:59:25.500 --> 1:59:26.500]  That's their affidavit.

[1:59:38.500 --> 2:00:04.500]  You have been warned.
[2:00:26.500 --> 2:00:27.500]  Look at these headlines.
[2:00:27.500 --> 2:00:32.500]  Making sure Osama does not hijack a bass boat, AP.
[2:00:32.500 --> 2:00:35.500]  U.S. Air Force calls for mission to combat climate change.
[2:00:35.500 --> 2:00:37.500]  They want to spray the sky for you.
[2:00:37.500 --> 2:00:45.500]  How town hall snoopers hijack anti-terror powers to track down dog fouling.
[2:00:45.500 --> 2:00:46.500]  Dogs pooping, folks.
[2:00:46.500 --> 2:00:47.500]  Anti-terror forces.
[2:00:47.500 --> 2:00:49.500]  You can't make this up.
[2:00:49.500 --> 2:00:54.500]  Mennonite arrested for selling raw milk.
[2:00:54.500 --> 2:00:56.500]  You know what, pasteurization lets them do it.
[2:00:56.500 --> 2:01:00.500]  Let's them feed you rotten cow dung and blood and pus.
[2:01:00.500 --> 2:01:03.500]  I don't want to get into it here on air, but I know all about dairies.
[2:01:03.500 --> 2:01:05.500]  And it doesn't matter.
[2:01:05.500 --> 2:01:07.500]  It's unbelievable.
[2:01:07.500 --> 2:01:08.500]  SWAT teaming, by the way.
[2:01:08.500 --> 2:01:10.500]  That's what it's all about in Land of the Coward, Home of the Slaves.
[2:01:10.500 --> 2:01:15.500]  NYPD towards teams and police into the subways, randomly searching everyone.
[2:01:15.500 --> 2:01:21.500]  Handing out machine guns to the police saying they're getting ready for something big.
[2:01:21.500 --> 2:01:23.500]  Who knows?
[2:01:23.500 --> 2:01:26.500]  It's just amazing.
[2:01:26.500 --> 2:01:31.500]  Jim Mars in closing here.
[2:01:31.500 --> 2:01:34.500]  Do you think it's going to be incremental, the continued takeover?
[2:01:34.500 --> 2:01:37.500]  Is it going to be a big mass takeover?
[2:01:37.500 --> 2:01:39.500]  What do you think is going to happen?
[2:01:39.500 --> 2:01:54.500]  Well, again, having lived so long, I can go back to the 50s when they could see the spread of fascism in this country and of tyrannical practices.
[2:01:54.500 --> 2:01:58.500]  But of course, back then, we were all told that it was the communists.
[2:01:58.500 --> 2:02:00.500]  They were all behind it.
[2:02:00.500 --> 2:02:06.500]  And of course, we'd just gotten finished with the defeating the German National Socialist.
[2:02:06.500 --> 2:02:14.500]  And so then, but then with the collapse of communism, things went along kind of incrementally until the collapse of communism.
[2:02:14.500 --> 2:02:23.500]  And then all of a sudden, after a brief respite, we got the Bush administration and the neo-conservatives.
[2:02:23.500 --> 2:02:33.500]  And don't you agree, Alex, that the timetable seems to have been rushed up, that we're kind of seems they're hurrying up.
[2:02:33.500 --> 2:02:40.500]  It's almost as though they do know that something very, very traumatic is going to be happening in the future.
[2:02:40.500 --> 2:02:44.500]  So they want to get hold of us right now while they still...
[2:02:44.500 --> 2:02:50.500]  I mean, to be clear, we had tens of trillions of dollars of debt 10 years ago, 12 years ago.
[2:02:50.500 --> 2:02:53.500]  The camps built, they'd martial law train the police.
[2:02:53.500 --> 2:02:59.500]  They could have gone ahead with it then, but in comparison, it's just gets bigger and bigger and more and more.
[2:02:59.500 --> 2:03:06.500]  And they're shifting much of the economy, much of the college grads over into this, the vocational schools.
[2:03:06.500 --> 2:03:11.500]  It isn't computer repair or computer programming or animal husbandry.
[2:03:11.500 --> 2:03:13.500]  It's all police state.
[2:03:13.500 --> 2:03:19.500]  And for those that don't know, millions and millions of cops are going to find something to do and it's going to be running your life.
[2:03:19.500 --> 2:03:28.500]  Well, one of the biggest mistakes we've ever made is to allow them to privatize prisons, which means private companies run the prisons.
[2:03:28.500 --> 2:03:31.500]  Well, private companies are in it for the profit.
[2:03:31.500 --> 2:03:35.500]  And now we're going to have black water domestically running operations.
[2:03:35.500 --> 2:03:43.500]  And so they have every incentive to keep everyone in prison and to keep adding to the prison population,
[2:03:43.500 --> 2:03:48.500]  which now in the United States totals more than all of Europe combined.
[2:03:48.500 --> 2:03:54.500]  Well, we are 5% of the world's population and we have about 35% of the world's prison population.
[2:03:54.500 --> 2:03:56.500]  Right. Exactly.
[2:03:56.500 --> 2:04:05.500]  And I, you know, every time I hear that, I can't help but think of Anne Rand because she wants in one of her books, I think it was Atlas Shrugged.
[2:04:05.500 --> 2:04:16.500]  She said, you know, you can't control free citizens, but so you pass a myriad of laws so that the average guy can't go through the day without violating some law.
[2:04:16.500 --> 2:04:19.500]  And you can control criminals.
[2:04:19.500 --> 2:04:21.500]  Well, take the income tax.
[2:04:21.500 --> 2:04:25.500]  Different CPAs will give you a different filing each time.
[2:04:25.500 --> 2:04:27.500]  No one's following the law.
[2:04:27.500 --> 2:04:28.500]  You can't do it right.
[2:04:28.500 --> 2:04:30.500]  It's designed to ensnare you.
[2:04:30.500 --> 2:04:35.500]  Jim, I want to come back and plug some of your books one minute on the other side than Steve Quayle.

[2:06:46.500 --> 2:06:53.500]  In fact, rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[2:06:53.500 --> 2:06:58.500]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[2:06:58.500 --> 2:07:05.500]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[2:07:05.500 --> 2:07:10.500]  The solution. Detoxification integrated with the electrochipremere energy foot spa.

[2:07:47.500 --> 2:08:11.500]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:08:11.500 --> 2:08:18.500]  We'll be going to Steve Quayle, talk show host and his own right-offered researcher over with us for the balance of the broadcast today.
[2:08:18.500 --> 2:08:27.500]  At the end, I'm going to play a 10-minute compilation out of a new film. This section is called Mad Scientist.
[2:08:27.500 --> 2:08:36.500]  I want you to hear top transhumanists say their plan is to kill you. Their plan is mass death.
[2:08:36.500 --> 2:08:44.500]  When we talk about how they want to kill 80-90% of us, we're not joking around.
[2:08:44.500 --> 2:08:51.500]  But, going back to Jim Mars to finish up, Jim, tell us about some of your latest books and work in JimMars.com.
[2:08:51.500 --> 2:08:58.500]  Well, you can go and see my books at JimMars.com. That's J-I-M-M-A-R-R-S.com.
[2:08:58.500 --> 2:09:03.500]  Keep up with some of the news that you won't hear in the mainstream media.
[2:09:03.500 --> 2:09:14.500]  You can also go to any bookstore. You can get my book Crossfire, the plot to kill Kennedy, which is the biggest selling Kennedy assassination book.
[2:09:14.500 --> 2:09:21.500]  You can get Alien Agenda, which is a non-fiction journalistic overview of the UFO situation.
[2:09:21.500 --> 2:09:32.500]  You can get Rule by Secrecy, which will tell you who these people are, how they came to be, and what their game plan is, and then right on up through the terror conspiracy.
[2:09:32.500 --> 2:09:36.500]  And by the way, we carry that book at infowars.com as well.
[2:09:36.500 --> 2:09:42.500]  Yes. Deception 9-11 and the loss of liberty. And then I have a new one coming out.
[2:09:42.500 --> 2:09:49.500]  It'll be available around the 1st of July that's going to blow everybody's mind.
[2:09:49.500 --> 2:10:00.500]  So be sure and be looking for that because it will, again, pinpoint and bring right up to date who is behind this destruction of the United States.
[2:10:00.500 --> 2:10:07.500]  And you've discovered it's bottom line. I mean, it's what the BBC and others now admit, the Nazi connection.
[2:10:07.500 --> 2:10:12.500]  Right. Except you have to understand, again, Nazi is simply acronym for National Socialism.
[2:10:12.500 --> 2:10:16.500]  And it didn't start over there. It actually came from here and went over there.
[2:10:16.500 --> 2:10:27.500]  It came from Wall Street, the Bank of England. So the very same people who created the German Nazis are now trying to turn North America into a national socialist state.
[2:10:27.500 --> 2:10:33.500]  Well, look at the name of Homeland Security. Look at how the 68 gun control act is word-for-word German translation from their gun control act.
[2:10:33.500 --> 2:10:39.500]  I mean, the uniforms, the nomenclature. Jim, this is going to be big. Can't wait to talk to you then. Take care.
[2:10:39.500 --> 2:10:41.500]  Okay. Good to be with you.
[2:10:41.500 --> 2:10:48.500]  God bless you. Jimmarsh.com. Okay. Shifting gears now to Steve Quayle. I haven't done a pre-interview with Steve.
[2:10:48.500 --> 2:10:54.500]  There's so much to talk about. Steve, what do you think is most important to discuss out of the gates today?
[2:10:54.500 --> 2:11:03.500]  Well, I think, Alex, what you and I have been warning about for over a decade, decade and a half, we're now at the point where there's no more warning,
[2:11:03.500 --> 2:11:12.500]  there's no more events that need to lead up to the big event, which in my opinion is the annihilation and the extermination of almost 90% of the world's population.
[2:11:12.500 --> 2:11:20.500]  No food, no fuel, no future. I heard you talking to Jim about the destruction of the genetically modified crops,
[2:11:20.500 --> 2:11:26.500]  excuse me, normal crops inserting genetically modified crops, producing genetically modified people.
[2:11:26.500 --> 2:11:35.500]  And the ultimate, you know, there's a word out there that it describes it all, and it's basically the extermination of mankind.
[2:11:35.500 --> 2:11:41.500]  And that's what's underway. So the warnings have been given, all of your video productions, all of your broadcasts.
[2:11:41.500 --> 2:11:45.500]  Everything leads us to this point now where we're seeing it all implemented, Alex.
[2:11:45.500 --> 2:11:50.500]  Xeno, Xeno side.
[2:11:50.500 --> 2:11:58.500]  Absolutely. And the thing is, is that we're now in an, and I believe we are in a scaled up time period between now and my time period.
[2:11:58.500 --> 2:12:08.500]  Let's just hit it by fall, late October. I think the country that people believe that they might even see a reflection of will be no more.
[2:12:08.500 --> 2:12:15.500]  All of your work that's gotten police state. Let's face it. Come on. With the newest introduction of the info that you've posted on your, your site,
[2:12:15.500 --> 2:12:21.500]  the, the, Charles, the Dale, Mayor, what's his name? Mayor Daley of Chicago, 13,000 M4s.
[2:12:21.500 --> 2:12:25.500]  The mayor of Boston wanting his police force to look more terrifying. Excuse me.
[2:12:25.500 --> 2:12:31.500]  Yeah. Let me stop you. See, this is getting so bad that I have mainline reports.
[2:12:31.500 --> 2:12:38.500]  In fact, I had that in my stack. I've got to dig the original headline out. Police chief says, yeah, I want black uniforms.
[2:12:38.500 --> 2:12:44.500]  I want the public afraid. Then they say, we're going to turn all our cops into SWAT team members. We're getting ready.
[2:12:44.500 --> 2:12:47.500]  I mean, they are gearing up, Steve.
[2:12:47.500 --> 2:12:52.500]  Right. Well, I think the thing that people need to understand is, so many times, Alex, over the years, I get asked the question,
[2:12:52.500 --> 2:12:58.500]  where is all this money coming from that we don't have? Obviously, all the, you know, trillions, tens of trillions,
[2:12:58.500 --> 2:13:03.500]  hundreds of trillions of dollars in debt, just the United States. The point is, is that they're spending money
[2:13:03.500 --> 2:13:07.500]  like there is no tomorrow because they're actively preparing for the day there is no tomorrow.
[2:13:07.500 --> 2:13:13.500]  And it doesn't matter if it's a prison camp, the UN troops, everything that we've been hot hot at for all these years.
[2:13:13.500 --> 2:13:19.500]  Now, people are recognizing when, quote, they can't get rice, they can't get wheat, they certainly can't get fuel.
[2:13:19.500 --> 2:13:23.500]  As you and I are speaking on the air today, you know, the truckers are headed to Washington, D.C.
[2:13:23.500 --> 2:13:33.500]  And the point is, is that there comes a point, Alex, where the time and the effort to try and inform will be over.
[2:13:33.500 --> 2:13:39.500]  And the only thing we can do is say, people, it's no longer, guess what's going to happen, it's happening now.
[2:13:39.500 --> 2:13:46.500]  Well, they've always, in the last 20 years or so, had enough of an infrastructure in to try it.
[2:13:46.500 --> 2:13:51.500]  And we had to report all along that they could do it any minute, though we always thought it was out in the future.
[2:13:51.500 --> 2:13:58.500]  But now the busy buzzing, the beehive, as they are just everywhere, and I'm trying to pull that article up right now.
[2:13:58.500 --> 2:14:06.500]  I'd even forgotten about that this weekend with the major police chief saying, yeah, I'm, you know, we fired the old police chief.
[2:14:06.500 --> 2:14:11.500]  I'm back in power. We're getting rid of the less scary uniforms and we want to terrify the public.
[2:14:11.500 --> 2:14:15.500]  That's terrorism. Their own manuals say the black mask is for fear.
[2:14:15.500 --> 2:14:21.500]  It's the old inquisitor, you know, would wear a black mask, the old executioner.
[2:14:21.500 --> 2:14:25.500]  And then Mayor Daley says we're getting ready to basically have fights with the public.
[2:14:25.500 --> 2:14:28.500]  That's mainstream news, issuing them all automatic weapons.
[2:14:28.500 --> 2:14:33.500]  I mean, my God, here's the bottom line. They're going to bankrupt the economy.
[2:14:33.500 --> 2:14:36.500]  We're going into slavery. They know you're not going to like it.
[2:14:36.500 --> 2:14:40.500]  The whole war on terror is about a war on you.
[2:14:40.500 --> 2:14:43.500]  It's the government run by the elite versus the people.
[2:14:43.500 --> 2:14:46.500]  It's been a complete hoax. They control LCI ADA.
[2:14:46.500 --> 2:14:48.500]  I mean, Steve, can you explain that to people?
[2:14:48.500 --> 2:14:54.500]  Well, sure. I think the thing that people need to understand is that it's a Hegelian dialectic with a new
[2:14:54.500 --> 2:14:58.500]  abrogation of terms we're familiar with. For instance, the war on terror.
[2:14:58.500 --> 2:15:02.500]  As you know, Alex, and you do a wonderful job in explaining this in your videos,
[2:15:02.500 --> 2:15:09.500]  but you initially start out with focusing and localizing your definition of terror.
[2:15:09.500 --> 2:15:15.500]  Then little by little, you expand everyone and anyone that you want to clude in that.
[2:15:15.500 --> 2:15:20.500]  And that's why Shertoff has been the man, I think, responsible in the Department of Homeland Security.
[2:15:20.500 --> 2:15:25.500]  Look, you and I are the two guys that talked at length years ago about Marcus Wolfe and what,
[2:15:25.500 --> 2:15:27.500]  PrimaCop, okay, being brought to the United States.
[2:15:27.500 --> 2:15:30.500]  And now we've got the Cattle Tail Nation.
[2:15:30.500 --> 2:15:35.500]  We've got the situation where basically the neighborhood watch groups are going to be reporting to
[2:15:35.500 --> 2:15:39.500]  Department of Homeland Security. And by the way, Alex, people need to understand that one of the things
[2:15:39.500 --> 2:15:45.500]  that's going to be a signal post for them to see is that if Denver starts to see an influx
[2:15:45.500 --> 2:15:49.500]  of a mass amount of federal officials, I think it's been lost over the years,
[2:15:49.500 --> 2:15:54.500]  but Denver becomes the provisional capital of the United States when, and not if,
[2:15:54.500 --> 2:15:56.500]  when Washington, D.C. is taken out.
[2:15:56.500 --> 2:16:00.500]  So the rumors out there that people who are in the know are, and I'd say this,
[2:16:00.500 --> 2:16:07.500]  I cannot confirm these at this point, but that Denver's going to experience massive fuel shortages
[2:16:07.500 --> 2:16:12.500]  and that is a precursor to keeping everybody in their place.
[2:16:12.500 --> 2:16:16.500]  Also, also exactly, this is all being orchestrated and that's admitted.
[2:16:16.500 --> 2:16:21.500]  I mean, the GMO company said they wanted to corner the market, cause problems,
[2:16:21.500 --> 2:16:25.500]  make you eat GMO, infect everything, cause shortages.
[2:16:25.500 --> 2:16:27.500]  Notice the more everything, the same thing with the fuel.
[2:16:27.500 --> 2:16:31.500]  OPEC says they may send it up to $200 a barrel.
[2:16:31.500 --> 2:16:35.500]  Folks, you think a dollar, you think $118 a barrel is bad.
[2:16:35.500 --> 2:16:39.500]  Imagine $200, that'll be $6, $7 a gallon gas.
[2:16:39.500 --> 2:16:46.500]  All of this squeezing you, but you never blame the government because they're protecting you from al-Qaeda.
[2:16:46.500 --> 2:16:49.500]  They use that as the organizing force.
[2:16:49.500 --> 2:16:54.500]  And now Rush Limbaugh has called for riots and burning cars in Denver, the Democratic Convention.
[2:16:54.500 --> 2:17:00.500]  Meanwhile, the Recreate 68 group, their subgroups are calling for attacking police, throwing blood on them.
[2:17:00.500 --> 2:17:02.500]  That's to create riots.
[2:17:02.500 --> 2:17:05.500]  I mean, you can just see the operation right out in the open.
[2:17:05.500 --> 2:17:06.500]  Absolutely.
[2:17:06.500 --> 2:17:13.500]  And now let's, you know, couple that in with what's going on in New York with the shooting of that black guy in cold blood.
[2:17:13.500 --> 2:17:14.500]  Come on, 50 rounds.
[2:17:14.500 --> 2:17:22.500]  You know, the thing is, I think Alex, people need to become infuriated because what is not still registering is, look,
[2:17:22.500 --> 2:17:26.500]  if they'll shoot an unarmed guy, and I know the circumstances, I read the situation,
[2:17:26.500 --> 2:17:31.500]  but you don't, you know, pump out 50 rounds and you don't go into that situation,
[2:17:31.500 --> 2:17:35.500]  then put it before a judge who's going to rule against all common sense.
[2:17:35.500 --> 2:17:37.500]  And look, this is the attitude that's out there.
[2:17:37.500 --> 2:17:43.500]  And I believe that the outcome of that trial was preset because I believe the same guys behind the curtain
[2:17:43.500 --> 2:17:47.500]  that you and I have spent the majority of our life trying to talk about and warn people about,
[2:17:47.500 --> 2:17:52.500]  they're the ones that want to basically get this thing kicked into high gear,
[2:17:52.500 --> 2:17:57.500]  and that's why it brings me to this fall scenario where, again, this is different than any other scenario.
[2:17:57.500 --> 2:18:01.500]  By the way, Dan Dorfman in The New York Sunday had an article where he says,
[2:18:01.500 --> 2:18:03.500]  now come on, that's Mr. Wall Street, okay?
[2:18:03.500 --> 2:18:08.500]  He's saying that gas is going to $10 a gallon, oil is going to $200 a barrel.
[2:18:08.500 --> 2:18:10.500]  But you see, it's not a question of price, Alex.
[2:18:10.500 --> 2:18:12.500]  It becomes a question of availability, conveniently.
[2:18:12.500 --> 2:18:17.500]  Yesterday we have a big refinery protest where the union shuts it down,
[2:18:17.500 --> 2:18:21.500]  we get 10% from a British refinery, 10% from a refined oil product.
[2:18:21.500 --> 2:18:25.500]  Now we've got a situation where, obviously, everybody is saying,
[2:18:25.500 --> 2:18:30.500]  look, the American dollar isn't worth enough and we want to price it higher and higher and higher.
[2:18:30.500 --> 2:18:34.500]  So if you've got $200 oil from this point, you've got, in effect,
[2:18:34.500 --> 2:18:40.500]  a de facto currency devaluation of better than 50%, almost 100%.
[2:18:40.500 --> 2:18:42.500]  Let's be clear about this.
[2:18:42.500 --> 2:18:44.500]  The big central banks issued all the liquidity.
[2:18:44.500 --> 2:18:47.500]  They bought up all the raw resources and commodities.
[2:18:47.500 --> 2:18:52.500]  Now they're going to fold up the Ponzi scheme, totally implode everything,
[2:18:52.500 --> 2:18:57.500]  and then turn loose millions of police now openly working with gang members
[2:18:57.500 --> 2:18:59.500]  and felons and illegal aliens.
[2:18:59.500 --> 2:19:02.500]  I mean, this is all, everything we said has now been announced
[2:19:02.500 --> 2:19:04.500]  and you're going to find it at the terrorist, our folks.
[2:19:04.500 --> 2:19:06.500]  It's going to be your house when they're taking it.
[2:19:06.500 --> 2:19:09.500]  Right, and by the way, let me share this with you.
[2:19:09.500 --> 2:19:10.500]  There is talk.
[2:19:10.500 --> 2:19:14.500]  I have not seen the actual document, Alex, but they are going to include,
[2:19:14.500 --> 2:19:15.500]  you ready for this?
[2:19:15.500 --> 2:19:17.500]  Financial terrorism.
[2:19:17.500 --> 2:19:22.500]  They're going to go after people that were sold to bill of goods by the appraisers,
[2:19:22.500 --> 2:19:23.500]  by the mortgage companies.
[2:19:23.500 --> 2:19:26.500]  They're going after those guys to throw them into debtors' prison.
[2:19:26.500 --> 2:19:28.500]  And, you know, we've talked about that before.
[2:19:28.500 --> 2:19:31.500]  Well, actually, I've seen that starting in England and also here in the U.S.
[2:19:31.500 --> 2:19:33.500]  and it gets worse.
[2:19:33.500 --> 2:19:34.500]  It gets worse.
[2:19:34.500 --> 2:19:38.500]  They're now saying legal porn is going to be illegal.
[2:19:38.500 --> 2:19:40.500]  You're going to go to prison for that.
[2:19:40.500 --> 2:19:42.500]  Now, now, again, I'm not defending pornography.
[2:19:42.500 --> 2:19:46.500]  The point is, they put it out there, then you take the bait, you're going to prison.
[2:19:48.500 --> 2:19:50.500]  It is a big idea.
[2:19:50.500 --> 2:19:52.500]  A new world order.
[2:19:52.500 --> 2:19:57.500]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:19:57.500 --> 2:20:00.500]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[2:20:00.500 --> 2:20:03.500]  What their objective would be world domination?
[2:20:03.500 --> 2:20:06.500]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:20:06.500 --> 2:20:09.500]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[2:20:09.500 --> 2:20:14.500]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:20:17.500 --> 2:20:22.500]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:20:22.500 --> 2:20:26.500]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:20:26.500 --> 2:20:28.500]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:20:28.500 --> 2:20:30.500]  Most people have no idea.
[2:20:30.500 --> 2:20:31.500]  They're not after money.
[2:20:31.500 --> 2:20:32.500]  They have all the money they need.
[2:20:32.500 --> 2:20:33.500]  They're after power.
[2:20:33.500 --> 2:20:34.500]  Yes, they're after easy.

[2:23:45.500 --> 2:23:48.500]  Day after day.
[2:23:48.500 --> 2:23:51.500]  Alone on a hill.
[2:23:51.500 --> 2:23:58.500]  The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[2:23:58.500 --> 2:24:01.500]  But nobody wants to know him.
[2:24:01.500 --> 2:24:05.500]  They can see that he's just a fool.
[2:24:05.500 --> 2:24:08.500]  And he never gives an answer,
[2:24:08.500 --> 2:24:15.500]  but the fool on the hill sees the sun going down.
[2:24:15.500 --> 2:24:22.500]  And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round.
[2:24:22.500 --> 2:24:26.500]  Well, on the way.
[2:24:26.500 --> 2:24:29.500]  Head in a clock.
[2:24:29.500 --> 2:24:31.500]  Okay, we're back live.
[2:24:31.500 --> 2:24:34.500]  Talking to you.
[2:24:34.500 --> 2:24:38.500]  Steve Quayle, SteveQuayle.com.
[2:24:38.500 --> 2:24:42.500]  Links to it up on infowars.com.
[2:24:42.500 --> 2:24:47.500]  Steve, you know, we're dealing with this organization who wants total control,
[2:24:47.500 --> 2:24:51.500]  who wants to play God, who are doing so many things to destroy the planet
[2:24:51.500 --> 2:24:56.500]  while at the same time claiming the mantle of being the protectors of the earth.
[2:24:56.500 --> 2:25:01.500]  Do you think they're going to go ahead and destroy the planet?
[2:25:01.500 --> 2:25:07.500]  Do you think they're going to go ahead and go with some type of hot war
[2:25:07.500 --> 2:25:10.500]  against the people where it does come to a head?
[2:25:10.500 --> 2:25:13.500]  Or is it just going to incrementally get worse and worse?
[2:25:13.500 --> 2:25:17.500]  Well, I think that based on daily and what I'm hearing from the back side,
[2:25:17.500 --> 2:25:21.500]  and I want to read you, by the way, don't let me get away from an interview
[2:25:21.500 --> 2:25:24.500]  that was done off-air between two of the pilots,
[2:25:24.500 --> 2:25:27.500]  actually while they're in the air, spray-plating us with chemtrails.
[2:25:27.500 --> 2:25:32.500]  I think they're going to initiate a form of genetic attack upon the crops.
[2:25:32.500 --> 2:25:37.500]  That's why they put the seeds away and they know as arc equivalent of Svalbard,
[2:25:37.500 --> 2:25:40.500]  the New World Order elite seed bank, okay?
[2:25:40.500 --> 2:25:43.500]  But the thing is, is that to answer your questions specifically,
[2:25:43.500 --> 2:25:45.500]  they're going for it, Alex, okay?
[2:25:45.500 --> 2:25:49.500]  The bottom line is, is that all of the money, and people need to realize
[2:25:49.500 --> 2:25:54.500]  that they're spending billions if not trillions to know everything we think do and say
[2:25:54.500 --> 2:25:57.500]  to track us in every single way.
[2:25:57.500 --> 2:26:01.500]  And yet, you know, they want to make sure they hide behind the blast black mass.
[2:26:01.500 --> 2:26:04.500]  I remember when you and I first did that interview a number of years ago,
[2:26:04.500 --> 2:26:08.500]  we said there's only one group of people in the world that hide behind the black mass,
[2:26:08.500 --> 2:26:09.500]  and those are the assassins.
[2:26:09.500 --> 2:26:11.500]  But now, let me read you.
[2:26:11.500 --> 2:26:13.500]  Can I just read you something that's a paragraph that'll blow your mind?
[2:26:13.500 --> 2:26:14.500]  Go ahead.
[2:26:14.500 --> 2:26:18.500]  These people are laughing at us, laughing at the people out there.
[2:26:18.500 --> 2:26:21.500]  They don't see what we, the fact that we don't see,
[2:26:21.500 --> 2:26:23.500]  or they think we don't see what they're doing, okay?
[2:26:23.500 --> 2:26:26.500]  This was on the 23rd of April.
[2:26:26.500 --> 2:26:29.500]  It was 123.475, the ban.
[2:26:29.500 --> 2:26:32.500]  And this was their 10th day.
[2:26:32.500 --> 2:26:36.500]  There's two pilots talking, two spray plane pilots talking,
[2:26:36.500 --> 2:26:40.500]  that this is their 10th day up over Maryland and Rhode Island,
[2:26:40.500 --> 2:26:42.500]  and that today they're doing Rhode Island.
[2:26:42.500 --> 2:26:45.500]  And they're now logging about nine and a half hours per day each.
[2:26:45.500 --> 2:26:47.500]  This is their talking between each other.
[2:26:47.500 --> 2:26:51.500]  And then, John, one of the pilots said that his plane is having some kind of malfunction,
[2:26:51.500 --> 2:26:55.500]  which he said wasted time and is cutting into his salary because it keeps happening.
[2:26:55.500 --> 2:26:59.500]  Right as he got up to altitude to start the first line today,
[2:26:59.500 --> 2:27:01.500]  spraying the chemtrails in the sky, he said that,
[2:27:01.500 --> 2:27:06.500]  he said we're flying in Bravo airspace between 4,000 and 8,000 feet,
[2:27:06.500 --> 2:27:10.500]  AGL above ground level, and he's serious, excuse me,
[2:27:10.500 --> 2:27:12.500]  he's serious and curious at the same time
[2:27:12.500 --> 2:27:16.500]  why they're having issues with their GPS
[2:27:16.500 --> 2:27:20.500]  and how it doesn't happen when he does the Chicago area or other areas.
[2:27:20.500 --> 2:27:22.500]  Look at this, here's quote for quote,
[2:27:22.500 --> 2:27:24.500]  when we're done and we exit the area,
[2:27:24.500 --> 2:27:27.500]  we should do a big circle around the Bravo airspace
[2:27:27.500 --> 2:27:31.500]  and see how much we can mess up the national air traffic system.
[2:27:31.500 --> 2:27:33.500]  Totally screw them up.
[2:27:33.500 --> 2:27:36.500]  Then they both laugh, yeah, that would be awesome.
[2:27:36.500 --> 2:27:39.500]  So, ladies and gentlemen, this is underway.
[2:27:39.500 --> 2:27:41.500]  You know, Alex, there used to be a joke,
[2:27:41.500 --> 2:27:45.500]  people used to laugh at some of the information you and I would put out,
[2:27:45.500 --> 2:27:48.500]  but here are the spray plane pilots.
[2:27:48.500 --> 2:27:50.500]  Well, let me stop you, let me stop you.
[2:27:50.500 --> 2:27:55.500]  Mainstream news today, it's up on prisonplanet.com.
[2:27:55.500 --> 2:28:00.500]  Military wants to save the Earth's environment by spraying the clouds,
[2:28:00.500 --> 2:28:03.500]  giving us a sunscreen from the solar radiation.
[2:28:03.500 --> 2:28:07.500]  Textbooks, government approved, admit they're spraying us.
[2:28:07.500 --> 2:28:10.500]  There's all these different government programs that have now come out
[2:28:10.500 --> 2:28:12.500]  where they admit, but they claim it's for weather.
[2:28:12.500 --> 2:28:14.500]  We know that's part of the program,
[2:28:14.500 --> 2:28:16.500]  but my point is that something is going on.
[2:28:16.500 --> 2:28:20.500]  In 1996, before that, trails disappeared.
[2:28:20.500 --> 2:28:22.500]  Now, many of the trails don't disappear.
[2:28:22.500 --> 2:28:24.500]  They hang for hours and get bigger.
[2:28:24.500 --> 2:28:27.500]  How many programs do you think there are, Steve, from all your study?
[2:28:27.500 --> 2:28:32.500]  Well, from what I've been told by people that basically war against these people
[2:28:32.500 --> 2:28:36.500]  in the world of, you know, what I call the silent war that's going on,
[2:28:36.500 --> 2:28:39.500]  different aspects of our military at our war with each other,
[2:28:39.500 --> 2:28:44.500]  there's at least a dozen different programs being incorporated in the chemical spraying.
[2:28:44.500 --> 2:28:46.500]  Let me share this with you.
[2:28:46.500 --> 2:28:50.500]  You talked about genetically modified, talking about transhumanism
[2:28:50.500 --> 2:28:52.500]  and the genetically modified organisms.
[2:28:52.500 --> 2:28:56.500]  The point is this that Cliff Karnicom and others have documented
[2:28:56.500 --> 2:28:59.500]  red human leukocytes in the chemtrail spray.
[2:28:59.500 --> 2:29:02.500]  Everything that they spray supposedly to modify the weather.
[2:29:02.500 --> 2:29:04.500]  Listen, this is nothing new.
[2:29:04.500 --> 2:29:09.500]  Weather modification was the original Dr. Teller of Majestic 12.
[2:29:09.500 --> 2:29:12.500]  His desire to give that a cover, the real thing.
[2:29:12.500 --> 2:29:15.500]  Stay there, stay there. Yeah, no, Jim Keith in his book,
[2:29:15.500 --> 2:29:19.500]  Black Helicopters Over America 1 and 2 has all the mainstream articles
[2:29:19.500 --> 2:29:23.500]  where they did the test of white blood cells being sprayed on people.
[2:29:23.500 --> 2:29:27.500]  And there's all the thousands of declassified examples there altering our DNA right now.
[2:29:27.500 --> 2:29:29.500]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:29:29.500 --> 2:29:33.500]  Our guest is Steve Quayle. We'll be opening the phones up coming up here in a few minutes.
[2:29:38.500 --> 2:29:41.500]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:41.500 --> 2:29:45.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:49.500 --> 2:29:51.500]  Hey there, this is your Radio Talking.
[2:29:51.500 --> 2:29:55.500]  Have you noticed how every type of gadget these days requires some specific type of battery?
[2:29:55.500 --> 2:29:57.500]  It doesn't matter what kind of gadget you're using.
[2:29:57.500 --> 2:29:59.500]  We all take different sizes and types of batteries.

[2:30:01.500 --> 2:30:02.500]  More like Battery Heaven.

[2:30:09.500 --> 2:30:12.500]  Whether it's a hard-to-find battery that your local stores don't carry,
[2:30:12.500 --> 2:30:14.500]  laptop batteries, computer backup batteries,
[2:30:14.500 --> 2:30:16.500]  BatteryStation.com has it all.

[2:30:39.500 --> 2:30:43.500]  That's 417-257-7799.
[2:30:43.500 --> 2:30:44.500]  Visit BatteryStation.com.

[2:30:48.500 --> 2:30:51.500]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth,
[2:30:51.500 --> 2:30:55.500]  no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds,
[2:30:55.500 --> 2:30:56.500]  and oil of the hemp plant.
[2:30:56.500 --> 2:31:02.500]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S. and Canada.
[2:31:02.500 --> 2:31:07.500]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana
[2:31:07.500 --> 2:31:09.500]  and is certified THC-free.
[2:31:09.500 --> 2:31:13.500]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[2:31:13.500 --> 2:31:15.500]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[2:31:15.500 --> 2:31:19.500]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum packed
[2:31:19.500 --> 2:31:22.500]  and is priced affordably to be used as a storeable food.
[2:31:22.500 --> 2:31:25.500]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.
[2:31:25.500 --> 2:31:30.500]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-691-2608
[2:31:30.500 --> 2:31:33.500]  or go to HempUSA.org and order today.
[2:31:33.500 --> 2:31:36.500]  The body will react and heal itself given the proper nutrition.
[2:31:36.500 --> 2:31:38.500]  This superfood will be your greatest asset.
[2:31:38.500 --> 2:31:42.500]  So try it today, store it today, and change your life.
[2:31:42.500 --> 2:31:47.500]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from HempUSA.org.
[2:31:47.500 --> 2:31:51.500]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[2:31:51.500 --> 2:31:54.500]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals
[2:31:54.500 --> 2:31:57.500]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[2:31:57.500 --> 2:32:00.500]  It's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate
[2:32:00.500 --> 2:32:02.500]  and others are absorbed into the skin.
[2:32:02.500 --> 2:32:06.500]  The KDF dual-media shower filter works with both hot and cold water
[2:32:06.500 --> 2:32:09.500]  and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron,
[2:32:09.500 --> 2:32:13.500]  and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[2:32:13.500 --> 2:32:17.500]  The KDF dual-media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons
[2:32:17.500 --> 2:32:19.500]  or one year whichever comes first.
[2:32:19.500 --> 2:32:23.500]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[2:32:23.500 --> 2:32:25.500]  iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[2:32:25.500 --> 2:32:28.500]  What about you? Order your KDF shower filter normally,
[2:32:28.500 --> 2:32:32.500]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[2:32:32.500 --> 2:32:38.500]  Call the Berkey guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653.

[2:32:58.500 --> 2:33:02.500]  1-800-259-9231.
[2:33:02.500 --> 2:33:08.500]  You can also call me on my local studio line at 512-646-5400.
[2:33:08.500 --> 2:33:11.500]  512-646-5400.
[2:33:11.500 --> 2:33:18.500]  We'll go back to my good friend Steve Quayle, SteveQuayle.com here in just one moment.
[2:33:18.500 --> 2:33:23.500]  Before we go back to him, I hope everybody will get the film I consulted on
[2:33:23.500 --> 2:33:27.500]  that's aired more than 50 times the last two months on Showtime.
[2:33:27.500 --> 2:33:30.500]  It's one of their main programs right now. They're really proud of it.
[2:33:30.500 --> 2:33:33.500]  American Drug War, the last wide hope.
[2:33:33.500 --> 2:33:35.500]  We have met the enemy and it's our own government,
[2:33:35.500 --> 2:33:39.500]  exposing the fact that the vast majority of narcotics are shipped in,
[2:33:39.500 --> 2:33:42.500]  laundered and controlled by the federal government and the private banks
[2:33:42.500 --> 2:33:44.500]  to control our government.
[2:33:44.500 --> 2:33:46.500]  American Drug War, the last wide hope.
[2:33:46.500 --> 2:33:50.500]  It's not available in stores until the 24th of May.
[2:33:50.500 --> 2:33:55.500]  I am the only person that has this film and I have it discounted $5.
[2:33:55.500 --> 2:33:57.500]  It's $29.95.
[2:33:57.500 --> 2:34:01.500]  You can go to the stores and see what they're offering it for when it comes out.
[2:34:01.500 --> 2:34:03.500]  You can pre-order it a few places now.
[2:34:03.500 --> 2:34:06.500]  Well, we have it in stock because I'm the consultant on the film.
[2:34:06.500 --> 2:34:11.500]  American Drug War, $24.95. Three hours of extras, a two-hour film.
[2:34:11.500 --> 2:34:13.500]  Five hours, $24.95.
[2:34:13.500 --> 2:34:16.500]  American Drug War, the last wide hope.
[2:34:16.500 --> 2:34:19.500]  Also, we've got William Lewis's new bombshell film,
[2:34:19.500 --> 2:34:22.500]  what I'm calling the new freedom to fascism.
[2:34:22.500 --> 2:34:28.500]  Washington You're Fired, also available at infowars.com for $19.95.
[2:34:28.500 --> 2:34:32.500]  And then don't forget, prisonplanet.tv.
[2:34:32.500 --> 2:34:37.500]  When we start the fourth hour in about 25 minutes with Steve Quayle with us,
[2:34:37.500 --> 2:34:40.500]  you'll be able to have the document cam, the video cam of myself.
[2:34:40.500 --> 2:34:45.500]  I'll show you news articles on the document cam and a lot more coming up in the next hour
[2:34:45.500 --> 2:34:48.500]  if you're a prisonplanet.tv member.
[2:34:48.500 --> 2:34:55.500]  And also, folks, this show wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for our sponsors,
[2:34:55.500 --> 2:34:58.500]  like Inner Food, the best green food out there.
[2:34:58.500 --> 2:34:59.500]  There's a lot of brands of this.
[2:34:59.500 --> 2:35:00.500]  I've tried a lot of them.
[2:35:00.500 --> 2:35:01.500]  They give me stomach eggs, head eggs.
[2:35:01.500 --> 2:35:03.500]  They got weird herbs in them.
[2:35:03.500 --> 2:35:04.500]  This doesn't.
[2:35:04.500 --> 2:35:08.500]  This just has foods that are known to have trace minerals and vitamins
[2:35:08.500 --> 2:35:10.500]  and just amazing things in them.
[2:35:10.500 --> 2:35:14.500]  Dulse kelp, barley grass, wheat grass, colorolina, spirulina, corella,
[2:35:14.500 --> 2:35:17.500]  balanced energy all day long, greater stamina, weight loss,
[2:35:17.500 --> 2:35:20.500]  20-power packed ingredients, greater mental clarity.
[2:35:20.500 --> 2:35:22.500]  Inner Food, give them a call.
[2:35:22.500 --> 2:35:25.500]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to get 10% off your order.
[2:35:25.500 --> 2:35:29.500]  Order in bulk at 20% off on top of the 10% great deal.
[2:35:29.500 --> 2:35:32.500]  1-866-762-9238.
[2:35:32.500 --> 2:35:37.500]  1-866-762-9238 or innerfood.com.
[2:35:37.500 --> 2:35:41.500]  You can also, of course, go to infowars.com
[2:35:41.500 --> 2:35:46.500]  and link through on the Inner Health Botanicals link there on the site.
[2:35:46.500 --> 2:35:53.500]  And you can get 10% off by linking through there as well.
[2:35:53.500 --> 2:35:55.500]  Going back to Steve Quill.
[2:35:55.500 --> 2:35:58.500]  Steve, before we run out of time and take all these calls,
[2:35:58.500 --> 2:36:02.500]  tell us about your website, some of the research, some of the books you've written.
[2:36:02.500 --> 2:36:05.500]  I mean, you wrote stuff about how they were spraying us in the air
[2:36:05.500 --> 2:36:07.500]  10 years ago, 12 years ago.
[2:36:07.500 --> 2:36:12.500]  You really are one of the trailblazers that realized just how diabolical
[2:36:12.500 --> 2:36:14.500]  their program was.
[2:36:14.500 --> 2:36:16.500]  Tell folks about some of the work you've done.
[2:36:16.500 --> 2:36:19.500]  Well, I think the most important work I've done that's concurrent
[2:36:19.500 --> 2:36:22.500]  with what we're talking about today is weather wars.
[2:36:22.500 --> 2:36:25.500]  And weather wars is different than most people write about heart
[2:36:25.500 --> 2:36:28.500]  going to the entire thinking mindset.
[2:36:28.500 --> 2:36:32.500]  And I would call subset or subhuman set that basically has brought us to where we are now.
[2:36:32.500 --> 2:36:35.500]  You can literally look at the time.
[2:36:35.500 --> 2:36:39.500]  Chemtrails spraying and chemtrail, not contrail.
[2:36:39.500 --> 2:36:42.500]  Chemical spraying started and likened it to the droughts, Alex.
[2:36:42.500 --> 2:36:44.500]  Now, droughts produce famine.
[2:36:44.500 --> 2:36:49.500]  The bottom line is you and I have quoted Katherine Bertini about food being used as a weapon.
[2:36:49.500 --> 2:36:54.500]  What is it that people cannot understand about absolute hydrophilic,
[2:36:54.500 --> 2:36:59.500]  in other words, water absorbing particles being sprayed over rain clouds?
[2:36:59.500 --> 2:37:06.500]  And all of a sudden, the entire history of rain for areas is no longer related.
[2:37:06.500 --> 2:37:12.500]  And then we start finding out that thousands of universities and government agencies,
[2:37:12.500 --> 2:37:16.500]  scores of government agencies, admit their quote doing research,
[2:37:16.500 --> 2:37:18.500]  manipulating weather with particles.
[2:37:18.500 --> 2:37:22.500]  And then now the military comes out in the last week in like five different announcements
[2:37:22.500 --> 2:37:24.500]  saying that they are doing it.
[2:37:24.500 --> 2:37:26.500]  I mean, so much is coming out now.
[2:37:26.500 --> 2:37:28.500]  It seems like they don't even care.
[2:37:28.500 --> 2:37:29.500]  Yeah, we're spraying you.
[2:37:29.500 --> 2:37:31.500]  Yeah, we bring the drugs in.
[2:37:31.500 --> 2:37:33.500]  I mean, just all of it, Steve.
[2:37:33.500 --> 2:37:37.500]  Can I tell you what I've said for now, since I started Talk Radio,
[2:37:37.500 --> 2:37:43.500]  I said I'll stand on this because, again, before God allows a judgment on this nation,
[2:37:43.500 --> 2:37:45.500]  when I say judgment, I'm talking destruction.
[2:37:45.500 --> 2:37:49.500]  I wish we could turn it around the best that we can do and the others
[2:37:49.500 --> 2:37:51.500]  who fight bravely against all this stuff.
[2:37:51.500 --> 2:37:55.500]  And I'm not talking about you and I on the radio, Alex, alone, other people that are on the radio,
[2:37:55.500 --> 2:37:59.500]  but I'm talking about literally men and women in the armed services who know what's going on
[2:37:59.500 --> 2:38:03.500]  that are literally laying their lives down daily to try and buy you and I
[2:38:03.500 --> 2:38:05.500]  and our listening audience is another day.
[2:38:05.500 --> 2:38:11.500]  But the thing is that this whole scale, decimation, destruction, annihilation,
[2:38:11.500 --> 2:38:14.500]  and extermination is underway.
[2:38:14.500 --> 2:38:16.500]  And I've got to tell you something.
[2:38:16.500 --> 2:38:22.500]  I think about, I think, 400 of my Weather Wars books to veterans when I was on coast to coast about,
[2:38:22.500 --> 2:38:24.500]  I don't know, six months ago.
[2:38:24.500 --> 2:38:29.500]  And to a man or a woman that got those, the ones that would write me back,
[2:38:29.500 --> 2:38:35.500]  and I probably got at least 200 emails or letters back, many times a lot of their amazing stories,
[2:38:35.500 --> 2:38:37.500]  some real heroes and heroines.
[2:38:37.500 --> 2:38:40.500]  But the bottom line is that they said it's always been us.
[2:38:40.500 --> 2:38:45.500]  In other words, it's the planned, and this is the thing that really is hard for me to say,
[2:38:45.500 --> 2:38:50.500]  but the planned destruction is now full-scale underway.
[2:38:50.500 --> 2:38:52.500]  The food is going to fail.
[2:38:52.500 --> 2:38:56.500]  The genetically altered crops, when I wrote Breathe No Evil more than a decade ago,
[2:38:56.500 --> 2:39:00.500]  obviously Breathe No Evil related to the time we would be coming into.
[2:39:00.500 --> 2:39:04.500]  When I wrote Genetic Armageddon, most people didn't know what transhumanism was,
[2:39:04.500 --> 2:39:07.500]  or the word chimera, chimera.
[2:39:07.500 --> 2:39:14.500]  Most people didn't understand that the Hitler eugenics were over time,
[2:39:14.500 --> 2:39:18.500]  and by the way, Alex, in my opinion, what people see being put forth in the press
[2:39:18.500 --> 2:39:21.500]  is absolutely 50 years after the fact.
[2:39:21.500 --> 2:39:22.500]  Oh, I agree.
[2:39:22.500 --> 2:39:27.500]  I remember getting on the air 13 years ago seeing BBC and others report
[2:39:27.500 --> 2:39:30.500]  that they'd created cross species human animal hybrids,
[2:39:30.500 --> 2:39:33.500]  but kept them at embryonic level, and we know better than that.
[2:39:33.500 --> 2:39:39.500]  And then just last month, they announced kind of the sheeple in a big announcement across all media
[2:39:39.500 --> 2:39:41.500]  that, yeah, we've got half human, half cow,
[2:39:41.500 --> 2:39:47.500]  but they admit that in, I remember reading that they had in Costa Rica five years ago,
[2:39:47.500 --> 2:39:51.500]  Washington Post reported part human, part chimpanzee,
[2:39:51.500 --> 2:39:53.500]  but they wouldn't quote show them.
[2:39:53.500 --> 2:39:56.500]  I mean, this is all light years ahead of what we even know.
[2:39:56.500 --> 2:39:58.500]  That's why they're on such power trips.
[2:39:58.500 --> 2:40:00.500]  They've got super weapons.
[2:40:00.500 --> 2:40:02.500]  They've developed all these incredible antimatter weapons.
[2:40:02.500 --> 2:40:06.500]  They now admit, but won't declassify exactly what they do.
[2:40:06.500 --> 2:40:10.500]  San Francisco Chronicles reported with antimatter weapons, the cyclotrons,
[2:40:10.500 --> 2:40:14.500]  the heavy reactors, the superconducting super colliders.
[2:40:14.500 --> 2:40:16.500]  I mean, this is total bedlam.
[2:40:16.500 --> 2:40:19.500]  And then you actually read what the globalists say.
[2:40:19.500 --> 2:40:21.500]  They just say, we're suicidal nihilists.
[2:40:21.500 --> 2:40:23.500]  We just want to kill.
[2:40:23.500 --> 2:40:26.500]  And then that's exactly what they're going to do.
[2:40:26.500 --> 2:40:29.500]  And it's almost like the book that was written almost 20 years ago,
[2:40:29.500 --> 2:40:30.500]  a higher form of killing.
[2:40:30.500 --> 2:40:34.500]  See, this is something that most people cannot wrap their minds around.
[2:40:34.500 --> 2:40:40.500]  People that listen to you and listen to me and grasp different parts of the puzzle.
[2:40:40.500 --> 2:40:44.500]  The whole puzzle is that this thing isn't happening by chance.
[2:40:44.500 --> 2:40:47.500]  These are not random acts of global warming.
[2:40:47.500 --> 2:40:52.500]  These are designed and implemented plans for total destruction,
[2:40:52.500 --> 2:40:54.500]  total world annihilation.
[2:40:54.500 --> 2:40:55.500]  And what does the elite get out of this?
[2:40:55.500 --> 2:40:57.500]  They get the promise of eternal life.
[2:40:57.500 --> 2:41:00.500]  They get to be basically, they get a new clone body.
[2:41:00.500 --> 2:41:02.500]  They get their entire sentence.
[2:41:02.500 --> 2:41:04.500]  It means their self-consciousness,
[2:41:04.500 --> 2:41:06.500]  everything that they have in their brains downloaded.
[2:41:06.500 --> 2:41:07.500]  And guess what?
[2:41:07.500 --> 2:41:08.500]  They never have to face it.
[2:41:08.500 --> 2:41:10.500]  Be God of the universe or His judgment,
[2:41:10.500 --> 2:41:16.500]  because the devils provide them with basically an e-ticket out of having to face the living God.
[2:41:16.500 --> 2:41:18.500]  It isn't going to happen, Jesus said, Alex,
[2:41:18.500 --> 2:41:21.500]  that except the days be short, there be no flesh left alive.
[2:41:21.500 --> 2:41:24.500]  Now, that's a real time marker in where we're at,
[2:41:24.500 --> 2:41:28.500]  because we're at the point now with everything that you just identified,
[2:41:28.500 --> 2:41:32.500]  whether it's relativistic, heavy ionic colliders, super colliders,
[2:41:32.500 --> 2:41:36.500]  all of the different beam weapons, anti-matter, contra-matter.
[2:41:36.500 --> 2:41:40.500]  Everything that's out there is basically designed to do one thing,
[2:41:40.500 --> 2:41:41.500]  and it's weaponized.
[2:41:41.500 --> 2:41:44.500]  So when I hear that the military, good night,
[2:41:44.500 --> 2:41:48.500]  they ought to go read their own Air Force report from almost a decade ago,
[2:41:48.500 --> 2:41:52.500]  that they're now emitting to weather modification.
[2:41:52.500 --> 2:41:55.500]  The point is that they talked about by 2025,
[2:41:55.500 --> 2:41:58.500]  they'll own the weather and what you're seeing, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:41:58.500 --> 2:42:00.500]  with the earthquakes going on right now,
[2:42:00.500 --> 2:42:02.500]  and can I just touch on this real quick?
[2:42:02.500 --> 2:42:03.500]  Yeah, I want to get into that.
[2:42:03.500 --> 2:42:06.500]  I want to get into the earthquakes just a moment, but go ahead.
[2:42:06.500 --> 2:42:09.500]  Well, I'm just saying, Alex, no one will deal with this except you are.
[2:42:09.500 --> 2:42:11.500]  Why are we having them in Illinois?
[2:42:11.500 --> 2:42:13.500]  I mean, powerful ones.
[2:42:13.500 --> 2:42:15.500]  Why are they having mega ones off the coast of Oregon?
[2:42:15.500 --> 2:42:21.500]  Well, first of all, if you understand the whole technology of...
[2:42:21.500 --> 2:42:25.500]  Well, Secretary of Defense Cohen admitted in 97 in Army times.
[2:42:25.500 --> 2:42:26.500]  Absolutely.
[2:42:26.500 --> 2:42:28.500]  He said, we have tectonic weapons.
[2:42:28.500 --> 2:42:29.500]  Absolutely.
[2:42:29.500 --> 2:42:30.500]  And that's what's going on.
[2:42:30.500 --> 2:42:33.500]  And I can tell you from incredibly brave men and women
[2:42:33.500 --> 2:42:35.500]  that are listening to this show and interview right now,
[2:42:35.500 --> 2:42:38.500]  I mean, we are chasing some very...
[2:42:38.500 --> 2:42:40.500]  Well, I've been told by good sources.
[2:42:40.500 --> 2:42:42.500]  Have you seen them over the core?
[2:42:42.500 --> 2:42:43.500]  Yes.
[2:42:43.500 --> 2:42:45.500]  I've been told by good sources that they actually have stuff like that.
[2:42:45.500 --> 2:42:46.500]  Absolutely.
[2:42:46.500 --> 2:42:48.500]  And they also have stuff, if you've ever...
[2:42:48.500 --> 2:42:52.500]  And what we're fighting against soon is if you've ever seen the movie,
[2:42:52.500 --> 2:42:56.500]  The Cave and Descent, you know, two very horrific movies.
[2:42:56.500 --> 2:42:59.500]  If you've ever seen the movie Hellboy, at the beginning of that,
[2:42:59.500 --> 2:43:01.500]  have you ever seen that, Alex?
[2:43:01.500 --> 2:43:02.500]  No, I haven't seen Hellboy.
[2:43:02.500 --> 2:43:03.500]  Hellboy is the...
[2:43:03.500 --> 2:43:06.500]  Just a bit of the Nazi technology opening up stargates.
[2:43:06.500 --> 2:43:09.500]  In other words, literally messing with God's creation
[2:43:09.500 --> 2:43:14.500]  to allow things that most of us only think live in science fiction into our realm,
[2:43:14.500 --> 2:43:17.500]  you know, and so we're right at that period of time
[2:43:17.500 --> 2:43:19.500]  where it's not an understatement.
[2:43:19.500 --> 2:43:20.500]  It's not a metaphor.
[2:43:20.500 --> 2:43:22.500]  It's not alliteration to say, all hell is breaking loose.
[2:43:22.500 --> 2:43:28.500]  But the thing that people have got to understand is that information has to be a catalyst.
[2:43:28.500 --> 2:43:31.500]  It has to be a motivator to get themselves out of harm way.
[2:43:31.500 --> 2:43:34.500]  Look, there is going to be no food.
[2:43:34.500 --> 2:43:36.500]  There is going to be no fuel.
[2:43:36.500 --> 2:43:41.500]  If people understand what you've presented all these years on talk radio,
[2:43:41.500 --> 2:43:44.500]  is that the bottom line is that global enslavement,
[2:43:44.500 --> 2:43:48.500]  that's for the lucky ones that basically will tow the party line.
[2:43:48.500 --> 2:43:50.500]  It's global annihilation.
[2:43:50.500 --> 2:43:53.500]  And these people obviously even a new quote just today.
[2:43:53.500 --> 2:43:55.500]  Just today, another quote, you know,
[2:43:55.500 --> 2:43:59.500]  we need to rid the population of the planet down and it was Ted Turner.
[2:43:59.500 --> 2:44:00.500]  Yeah, that's Ted Turner.
[2:44:00.500 --> 2:44:04.500]  Now, Massachusetts police get black uniforms to instill fear,
[2:44:04.500 --> 2:44:07.500]  sense of fear, Associated Press, April 24th.
[2:44:07.500 --> 2:44:09.500]  I wanted to read this because I don't want to just, you know,
[2:44:09.500 --> 2:44:11.500]  tell people that and then they not have it.
[2:44:11.500 --> 2:44:16.500]  Folks, this is how and things have gotten so bad that I have this article
[2:44:16.500 --> 2:44:19.500]  and it didn't even shock me anymore and I didn't even cover it.
[2:44:19.500 --> 2:44:21.500]  Okay, that's when you know it's bad.
[2:44:21.500 --> 2:44:22.500]  This is associated.
[2:44:22.500 --> 2:44:28.500]  Now, we always told you that black mask and black uniforms are always an archetypal level,
[2:44:28.500 --> 2:44:32.500]  which they're masters of basic psychology.
[2:44:32.500 --> 2:44:35.500]  It is meant to say, we're the bad guys.
[2:44:35.500 --> 2:44:39.500]  Okay, so it says the city's new police commissioner, William Fitchett.
[2:44:39.500 --> 2:44:41.500]  I want to get him on.
[2:44:41.500 --> 2:44:45.500]  It says members of the department's street crime unit will again don black military style uniforms
[2:44:45.500 --> 2:44:48.500]  as part of his strategy to deal with youth violence.
[2:44:48.500 --> 2:44:53.500]  Fitchett's predecessor, Edwin Flynn, had ditched the black attire
[2:44:53.500 --> 2:44:57.500]  as part of an effort to soften the image of the unit.
[2:44:57.500 --> 2:45:02.500]  Flynn's left Springfield in January to become the police chief in Milwaukee.
[2:45:02.500 --> 2:45:05.500]  Sergeant John Delaney told the city council hearing Wednesday
[2:45:05.500 --> 2:45:09.500]  that the Stark uniforms send a message to criminals and everybody else I would add
[2:45:09.500 --> 2:45:12.500]  that officers are serious about making a rest.
[2:45:12.500 --> 2:45:17.500]  Delaney said the sense of fear has been missing for the past few years.
[2:45:17.500 --> 2:45:21.500]  Now, there were federal grants over a decade ago.
[2:45:21.500 --> 2:45:23.500]  This all really accelerated a decade ago, as Steve knows,
[2:45:23.500 --> 2:45:24.500]  I was interviewing him back then.
[2:45:24.500 --> 2:45:26.500]  I know he was saying it.
[2:45:26.500 --> 2:45:33.500]  Federal grants for black uniforms, federal grants for the riot Darth Vader outfits they wear.
[2:45:33.500 --> 2:45:35.500]  They advertise them and say, be a stormtrooper.
[2:45:35.500 --> 2:45:40.500]  I want the police to know you're having mercury put in your child's shots.
[2:45:40.500 --> 2:45:42.500]  You're having fluoride put in your water.
[2:45:42.500 --> 2:45:45.500]  Thousands of different chemicals and drugs in all the water supplies.
[2:45:45.500 --> 2:45:47.500]  In Dallas, they admitted six years ago,
[2:45:47.500 --> 2:45:53.500]  Prozac in higher levels than it could be just from pills and people's excretions.
[2:45:53.500 --> 2:45:55.500]  They're putting it in there.
[2:45:55.500 --> 2:45:56.500]  They're spraying you.
[2:45:56.500 --> 2:45:58.500]  It's why you feel like crap.
[2:45:58.500 --> 2:46:02.500]  The food, the GMO food kills all the rats they feed it to.
[2:46:02.500 --> 2:46:04.500]  That's why diabetes is one in three.
[2:46:04.500 --> 2:46:07.500]  Cancer one in three from one in 33.
[2:46:07.500 --> 2:46:10.500]  I mean, the plagues are here now.
[2:46:10.500 --> 2:46:14.500]  They're just good and they can everybody think everything's okay
[2:46:14.500 --> 2:46:19.500]  and kind of marching into the future as they incrementally turn the heat up.
[2:46:19.500 --> 2:46:20.500]  I mean, it's here, Steve.
[2:46:20.500 --> 2:46:24.500]  As you say, it's just that we've been living in it for so long.
[2:46:24.500 --> 2:46:25.500]  We don't recognize it.
[2:46:25.500 --> 2:46:27.500]  And I would say this, Alex,
[2:46:27.500 --> 2:46:30.500]  and if we have been talking about it as we both have
[2:46:30.500 --> 2:46:33.500]  had a record video, previous recorded shows, et cetera,
[2:46:33.500 --> 2:46:37.500]  and we're down the line from here and most people are now just able
[2:46:37.500 --> 2:46:40.500]  to embrace what we've been telling them a decade ago,
[2:46:40.500 --> 2:46:47.500]  then can you imagine the ramifications of not where they're just getting to now?
[2:46:47.500 --> 2:46:49.500]  And I'm not saying that they sound exclusive or elitist,
[2:46:49.500 --> 2:46:51.500]  but I'm just saying, look, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:46:51.500 --> 2:46:56.500]  when you understand the transhumanist, that means basically, let me tell you what.
[2:46:56.500 --> 2:46:59.500]  Listen, I've got the top transhumanist with massive government funding
[2:46:59.500 --> 2:47:02.500]  on video and mainline TV reports.
[2:47:02.500 --> 2:47:05.500]  This thing we're going to play later is a compilation where they say,
[2:47:05.500 --> 2:47:09.500]  I mean, they say we hate the humans and it's the same thing as eugenics.
[2:47:09.500 --> 2:47:11.500]  And it's just death, death, death.
[2:47:11.500 --> 2:47:12.500]  Go ahead.
[2:47:12.500 --> 2:47:13.500]  Right.
[2:47:13.500 --> 2:47:14.500]  I got to tell you something.
[2:47:14.500 --> 2:47:17.500]  The old days, when I used to be in an exorcism ministry,
[2:47:17.500 --> 2:47:19.500]  and by the way, every Christian's given that authority
[2:47:19.500 --> 2:47:22.500]  in the basis of the word of God, but I can tell you this,
[2:47:22.500 --> 2:47:26.500]  the hatred, the contempt they have for their own species,
[2:47:26.500 --> 2:47:30.500]  I believe that the entities that are controlling all this are demon-possessed.
[2:47:30.500 --> 2:47:31.500]  They're demon-motivated.
[2:47:31.500 --> 2:47:32.500]  Now, let me stop you, Steve.
[2:47:32.500 --> 2:47:33.500]  Let me stop you.
[2:47:33.500 --> 2:47:34.500]  Yes.
[2:47:34.500 --> 2:47:35.500]  Even if we have a lot of atheists listening right now,
[2:47:35.500 --> 2:47:38.500]  and I'm a Christian, I make no bones about it,
[2:47:38.500 --> 2:47:41.500]  but I just cover what I can always prove.
[2:47:41.500 --> 2:47:42.500]  I want to make this clear.
[2:47:42.500 --> 2:47:45.500]  The elites believe they're channeling demons.
[2:47:45.500 --> 2:47:50.500]  The elites believe they're opening stargates with these superconductors.
[2:47:50.500 --> 2:47:55.500]  They believe they have their New Age worship center at the UN.
[2:47:55.500 --> 2:48:00.500]  They do, at the highest levels, believe they're being downloading Lucifer.
[2:48:00.500 --> 2:48:02.500]  They really do believe this.
[2:48:02.500 --> 2:48:05.500]  So even if you don't believe this, they do.
[2:48:05.500 --> 2:48:06.500]  Go ahead, Steve.
[2:48:06.500 --> 2:48:08.500]  Thank you, Alex, for making that point.
[2:48:08.500 --> 2:48:11.500]  That's the bottom line in all of this.
[2:48:11.500 --> 2:48:18.500]  The supernatural nature of this stuff is the transforming methodology that they're using.
[2:48:18.500 --> 2:48:20.500]  Look, it's the whole thing.
[2:48:20.500 --> 2:48:22.500]  It doesn't matter who's talking about it.
[2:48:22.500 --> 2:48:24.500]  That's the supernatural intelligence.
[2:48:24.500 --> 2:48:26.500]  It's supernatural empowering.
[2:48:26.500 --> 2:48:29.500]  Like you said, whether people who are atheists agnostic,
[2:48:29.500 --> 2:48:31.500]  they don't believe like you believe or I believe,
[2:48:31.500 --> 2:48:33.500]  either one of us are ashamed of Jesus.
[2:48:33.500 --> 2:48:36.500]  The point is Jesus told us it could be like this man times.
[2:48:36.500 --> 2:48:40.500]  And now the evil and the amount of evil that is being released
[2:48:40.500 --> 2:48:43.500]  is almost unembraceable by the human mind.
[2:48:43.500 --> 2:48:46.500]  And by the way, Alex, just as you and I are talking,
[2:48:46.500 --> 2:48:50.500]  Gretz just put up on his front page that gasoline may soon cost 10 bucks.
[2:48:50.500 --> 2:48:52.500]  Just as you and I have been talking.
[2:48:52.500 --> 2:48:55.500]  Well, yeah, the OPEC says it's going to be $200 a barrel.
[2:48:55.500 --> 2:49:02.500]  So $200 a barrel, if it's, what, $350 on average now, like $5 some areas,
[2:49:02.500 --> 2:49:05.500]  but $350 on average, it was right around that the other day.
[2:49:05.500 --> 2:49:06.500]  I know it's gone up.
[2:49:06.500 --> 2:49:09.500]  I can look, give me the actual cent amount, but it's around $350 right now.
[2:49:09.500 --> 2:49:16.500]  If it was to go to $200, we would be talking right there about $7 a gallon.
[2:49:16.500 --> 2:49:17.500]  Right.
[2:49:17.500 --> 2:49:20.500]  And the point is, though, is that look what this does to the farmers.
[2:49:20.500 --> 2:49:22.500]  See, it's a, it's a full.
[2:49:22.500 --> 2:49:23.500]  Cascading.
[2:49:23.500 --> 2:49:24.500]  It's a cascading.
[2:49:24.500 --> 2:49:29.500]  Yeah, I like that, that term, you know, it's not like just one dominoes in motion.
[2:49:29.500 --> 2:49:34.500]  All the dominoes are in motion from all the different sides that they represent.
[2:49:34.500 --> 2:49:40.500]  And the police are having open air rallies, talking about how they're going to fight terror,
[2:49:40.500 --> 2:49:43.500]  handing out machine guns and saying, we want to scare you.
[2:49:43.500 --> 2:49:47.500]  And they're, every marina is now saying, look for terrorists on the water,
[2:49:47.500 --> 2:49:48.500]  join Homeland Security.
[2:49:48.500 --> 2:49:52.500]  Homeland Security is getting rid of the, you know, weight requirements or health for their people.
[2:49:52.500 --> 2:49:54.500]  They're openly hiring felons.
[2:49:54.500 --> 2:49:59.500]  Austin County just announced Travis County, they're going to hire felons for the county now.
[2:49:59.500 --> 2:50:01.500]  I mean, my God, Steve, this is crazy.
[2:50:01.500 --> 2:50:05.500]  Well, it's not only crazy, but it's crazy by design.
[2:50:05.500 --> 2:50:06.500]  Okay.
[2:50:06.500 --> 2:50:09.500]  And then the thing is, is that I expect, first of all, let me go on record.
[2:50:09.500 --> 2:50:14.500]  I expect there to be an assassination attempt on one of the major political figures running
[2:50:14.500 --> 2:50:17.500]  for the Democratic Party long before the election.
[2:50:17.500 --> 2:50:21.500]  I also expect there to be shooters.
[2:50:21.500 --> 2:50:26.500]  The same Luciferians that you and I are always talking about will put their shooters into the field
[2:50:26.500 --> 2:50:32.500]  to tag some prominent member of whatever, the black community, the white community, the Hispanic community.
[2:50:32.500 --> 2:50:34.500]  And they're turning the screws up.
[2:50:34.500 --> 2:50:36.500]  Alex, everyone, you and I used to talk together.
[2:50:36.500 --> 2:50:37.500]  Stay there. Stay there, Steve.
[2:50:37.500 --> 2:50:41.500]  It's, it's like before a football play, the players are all lined up.
[2:50:41.500 --> 2:50:43.500]  The quarterbacks going.
[2:50:43.500 --> 2:50:48.500]  Blue 23, blue 24, hot, hot, hot.
[2:50:48.500 --> 2:50:50.500]  It is a big idea.
[2:50:50.500 --> 2:50:52.500]  A new world order.
[2:50:52.500 --> 2:50:57.500]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:50:57.500 --> 2:51:00.500]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[2:51:00.500 --> 2:51:03.500]  But their objective being world domination.
[2:51:03.500 --> 2:51:06.500]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:51:06.500 --> 2:51:16.500]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:51:16.500 --> 2:51:22.500]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:51:22.500 --> 2:51:26.500]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:51:26.500 --> 2:51:28.500]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:51:28.500 --> 2:51:30.500]  Most people have no idea they're not after money.
[2:51:30.500 --> 2:51:32.500]  They have all the money they need.
[2:51:32.500 --> 2:51:33.500]  They're after power.
[2:51:33.500 --> 2:51:34.500]  That's their affidavit.
[2:51:34.500 --> 2:51:39.500]  You can find the new world order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com
[2:51:39.500 --> 2:51:43.500]  or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:51:43.500 --> 2:51:46.500]  In-game blueprint for global enslaved.

[2:52:42.500 --> 2:52:51.420]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[2:52:51.420 --> 2:52:57.060]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[2:52:57.060 --> 2:53:01.620]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which
[2:53:01.620 --> 2:53:02.620]  are synthetic.
[2:53:02.620 --> 2:53:04.020]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[2:53:04.020 --> 2:53:07.980]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to
[2:53:07.980 --> 2:53:12.180]  coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin,
[2:53:12.180 --> 2:53:13.180]  and mucous membranes.

[2:54:17.860 --> 2:54:18.860]  We now have the fourth hour.
[2:54:18.860 --> 2:54:23.140]  We're very thankful to a lot of affiliates that are already picking it up, not just on
[2:54:23.140 --> 2:54:31.460]  AM and FM, but WWCR, also the internet at infowars.com.
[2:54:31.460 --> 2:54:37.020]  And on the info wars streams, we will continue in some of the breaks unabated, so if you
[2:54:37.020 --> 2:54:42.860]  want to hear the full transmission, go to the infowars.com streams, because one or two
[2:54:42.860 --> 2:54:47.860]  of those commercial breaks, we will not do the break on the internet streams, a little
[2:54:47.860 --> 2:54:49.740]  something extra for everybody.
[2:54:49.740 --> 2:54:54.580]  And for PrisonPlanet.tv members, we're already encoding, and streaming now will be live in
[2:54:54.580 --> 2:54:58.900]  five minutes with the document cam and the rest of it.
[2:54:58.900 --> 2:55:05.420]  Going back to Steve Quayle, Steve Bottomline, the elite, when I say they're insane, that
[2:55:05.420 --> 2:55:08.140]  kind of implies they're crazy and don't know what they're doing.
[2:55:08.140 --> 2:55:09.900]  They're crazy like a fox.
[2:55:09.900 --> 2:55:15.700]  But to those of us that are not into darkness, they just revel in death and destruction.
[2:55:15.700 --> 2:55:16.700]  They love it.
[2:55:16.700 --> 2:55:19.420]  They're like a moth to flame.
[2:55:19.420 --> 2:55:24.100]  And I don't know if it's all going to go to Hell in the Ham Basket in the next year,
[2:55:24.100 --> 2:55:25.580]  but I've never seen it this crazy.
[2:55:25.580 --> 2:55:31.460]  I've never seen them serving out machine guns to everybody.
[2:55:31.460 --> 2:55:36.660]  And the average cop out there, do you want to say anything to them about how their whole
[2:55:36.660 --> 2:55:39.100]  future is going to be destroyed if they go along with this?
[2:55:39.100 --> 2:55:41.300]  I mean, not by us, but by their masters.
[2:55:41.300 --> 2:55:45.500]  I mean, I know a lot of cops I talk to are waking up, but a lot of them are just modern
[2:55:45.500 --> 2:55:46.500]  Americans.
[2:55:46.500 --> 2:55:48.980]  You know, we're a country that kills babies, 50 million of them.
[2:55:48.980 --> 2:55:53.540]  I mean, a lot of these cops just don't care, and it is all about authority and carrying
[2:55:53.540 --> 2:55:54.540]  out evil.
[2:55:54.540 --> 2:55:55.540]  Right.
[2:55:55.540 --> 2:55:56.540]  Let me share this with you.
[2:55:56.540 --> 2:55:59.860]  A man that gave the information years ago on the red blue and green list, he's dead,
[2:55:59.860 --> 2:56:03.220]  by the way, he was murdered by the very people we're talking about.
[2:56:03.220 --> 2:56:07.420]  He basically talked about two lists at that point that were in the millions of names on
[2:56:07.420 --> 2:56:11.540]  red lists where everything from firearms owners to people that were outspoken.
[2:56:11.540 --> 2:56:17.540]  And by the way, this man was the head of a federal cabinet level position, okay.
[2:56:17.540 --> 2:56:20.580]  And the deal thinks the thing that's interesting, Alex, is the police.
[2:56:20.580 --> 2:56:22.420]  Let's talk about the blue list.
[2:56:22.420 --> 2:56:26.220]  The blue list was designed for them there to be incorporated as a brown shirt.
[2:56:26.220 --> 2:56:31.460]  In other words, they'll follow the orders from the computer generated pickup lists and
[2:56:31.460 --> 2:56:33.060]  hold for federal officials.
[2:56:33.060 --> 2:56:37.220]  And they publicly train in every city to drive buses around house to house.
[2:56:37.220 --> 2:56:40.180]  That's why they're going to basically convert the cops into SWAT members.
[2:56:40.180 --> 2:56:41.180]  You got it.
[2:56:41.180 --> 2:56:45.660]  And but the deal is, is 30 to 45 days, and by the way, this has been validated to me
[2:56:45.660 --> 2:56:48.540]  by active duty, multiple star generals, okay.
[2:56:48.540 --> 2:56:54.180]  This isn't just a dead guy speaking, but active duty, four star generals have said this and
[2:56:54.180 --> 2:56:57.780]  30 to 45 days after that, they all get whacked too.
[2:56:57.780 --> 2:57:02.140]  Because obviously if they would betray their countrymen, they don't stand a chance in the
[2:57:02.140 --> 2:57:03.140]  new world order.
[2:57:03.140 --> 2:57:08.140]  Well, the Soviets, and when they come into Romania or Czechoslovakia, or when the Nazis
[2:57:08.140 --> 2:57:13.100]  came in, like night of the long night, they're in Rome, they always, that is, the Romans
[2:57:13.100 --> 2:57:14.220]  would do that.
[2:57:14.220 --> 2:57:16.900]  They always kill who helped them take over.
[2:57:16.900 --> 2:57:17.900]  Absolutely.
[2:57:17.900 --> 2:57:22.820]  And see, but again, unless people understand that, that whole issue, this isn't just you
[2:57:22.820 --> 2:57:27.380]  and I yelling, screaming, I got to tell you something, I've screamed myself, of course,
[2:57:27.380 --> 2:57:29.180]  I know you have too sometimes.
[2:57:29.180 --> 2:57:35.220]  The point is that it's putting into perspective when you see this, look, the idea you control
[2:57:35.220 --> 2:57:37.620]  the food to control the people, the stories.
[2:57:37.620 --> 2:57:41.100]  I used to be in the food business, Alex, I can tell you this, I am connected with the
[2:57:41.100 --> 2:57:46.300]  biggest food suppliers in the United States and in the world, okay, and call them on the
[2:57:46.300 --> 2:57:47.300]  phone.
[2:57:47.300 --> 2:57:51.900]  And when they tell me what's going on and who's buying all the food, it's not, it's
[2:57:51.900 --> 2:57:58.500]  Bravo Sierras or Pure BS or Incure BS, it's going to the government, it's being delivered
[2:57:58.500 --> 2:58:04.700]  by astronomical amounts of resources, they're getting ready to basically pull the plug in
[2:58:04.700 --> 2:58:05.700]  all of us.
[2:58:05.700 --> 2:58:06.700]  Hey, I don't get it.
[2:58:06.700 --> 2:58:10.060]  I'm being told the same thing about by sponsors we have that are, you know, some of the biggest
[2:58:10.060 --> 2:58:12.900]  out there, like J. Michael Stevens group, they're saying the same thing, but even the
[2:58:12.900 --> 2:58:17.620]  mainstream media is, of course, they did all this by design, that's even coming out, that
[2:58:17.620 --> 2:58:22.700]  Big Agra has designed all this, as the UN document said they would, Steve back in 72nd, Steve
[2:58:22.700 --> 2:58:23.700]  Quill.com's website.
[2:58:23.700 --> 2:58:29.980]  All right, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.

[2:59:41.060 --> 3:00:06.180]  Raging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[3:00:06.180 --> 3:00:09.900]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the fourth and final hour of this worldwide broadcast
[3:00:09.900 --> 3:00:14.580]  against tyranny, Steve quail is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[3:00:14.580 --> 3:00:19.380]  In fact, what I'm going to do is I've kept promising to air the audio.
[3:00:19.380 --> 3:00:23.020]  It's about an eight minute different clips of transhumanist we're just going to do that
[3:00:23.020 --> 3:00:26.380]  come up in about 10 minutes because I want to get Steve's take on that we also want to
[3:00:26.380 --> 3:00:36.100]  take your phone calls at 512-646-5400 and of course the genesis number 1-800-259-9231
[3:00:36.100 --> 3:00:39.980]  will take calls off both those systems here in just a moment.
[3:00:39.980 --> 3:00:46.740]  But right now going back to Steve quail, Steve for the next 10 minutes, you've got the floor,
[3:00:46.740 --> 3:00:51.380]  other key areas, other things that listeners need to know about from all of your research
[3:00:51.380 --> 3:00:59.100]  as all of this appears to come to a head as the enemy openly announces what their plans
[3:00:59.100 --> 3:01:01.260]  are for society for all of us.
[3:01:01.260 --> 3:01:05.580]  I mean, when they come out and say we wear black uniforms to intimidate you as they announce
[3:01:05.580 --> 3:01:10.460]  that, I mean, I'm just going to show people on the document cam some of the news that
[3:01:10.460 --> 3:01:12.700]  I have here in front of me.
[3:01:12.700 --> 3:01:16.300]  Here's making sure Osama does not hijack bass boats.
[3:01:16.300 --> 3:01:24.300]  That's associated press there for everybody just right out in the open.
[3:01:24.300 --> 3:01:28.820]  Here's another one, US Air Force calls for mission to combat climate change by spraying
[3:01:28.820 --> 3:01:37.860]  the atmosphere and just as we always said by adding stuff to jet fuel, town hall snoopers,
[3:01:37.860 --> 3:01:42.860]  hijacked terror, anti-terror powers to crack down on people's dogs using the bathroom in
[3:01:42.860 --> 3:01:43.860]  the park.
[3:01:43.860 --> 3:01:47.460]  I mean, you cannot make this type of stuff up.
[3:01:47.460 --> 3:01:51.460]  Men and I had a resident for selling raw milk, highly respected, large facility, no one had
[3:01:51.460 --> 3:01:52.460]  ever gotten sick.
[3:01:52.460 --> 3:01:57.620]  They actually pasteurized it so they can feed you milk full of cow dung and blood and pus
[3:01:57.620 --> 3:01:59.060]  and I've worked in dairies.
[3:01:59.060 --> 3:02:00.060]  I've worked around them.
[3:02:00.060 --> 3:02:01.060]  I've visited them.
[3:02:01.060 --> 3:02:03.940]  I've worked on ranches that had dairies and then I've been made to work in them maybe
[3:02:03.940 --> 3:02:06.780]  a week or two out of three years I worked on ranches, but I know a little bit about
[3:02:06.780 --> 3:02:07.780]  them.
[3:02:07.780 --> 3:02:09.300]  The point is, it's really serious.
[3:02:09.300 --> 3:02:13.740]  Men and I had arrested a sheriff's candidate who believes crime is terrorism.
[3:02:13.740 --> 3:02:16.700]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[3:02:16.700 --> 3:02:18.300]  Steve, your take on that?
[3:02:18.300 --> 3:02:22.380]  Well, I think that everything is happening concurrently.
[3:02:22.380 --> 3:02:26.540]  I think people fail when they look at the world in a linear way, first and foremost,
[3:02:26.540 --> 3:02:29.540]  because they don't see how it's all termed loose at once.
[3:02:29.540 --> 3:02:35.220]  For instance, the genetically modified food at Alex, the situation with the xenoestrogens
[3:02:35.220 --> 3:02:42.180]  and bottled water, men's sperm count being so low, I mean, literally all of the issues
[3:02:42.180 --> 3:02:45.900]  that genetically we were designed so wonderfully and so beautifully.
[3:02:45.900 --> 3:02:50.780]  The 139 Psalm tells us that God is thoughts towards all of us who come to know him are
[3:02:50.780 --> 3:02:54.700]  more numerous than the San Joseese, so God really has our best interest at heart.
[3:02:54.700 --> 3:03:01.140]  But the thing is, is that people don't recognize that right now, the vaccination, here's what
[3:03:01.140 --> 3:03:07.060]  I was told, the most pressing bit of information I can tell everyone, is that the vaccination,
[3:03:07.060 --> 3:03:12.300]  look, all they have to do, Alex, is present four dead bodies, give it mass media hype
[3:03:12.300 --> 3:03:16.660]  and hysteria, and tell you that if you don't go, and by the way, they'll mutilate the bodies
[3:03:16.660 --> 3:03:20.700]  and say, look what this horrible disease has done, and if you don't take the vaccination,
[3:03:20.700 --> 3:03:25.580]  you'll be placed into a camp for your safety and for the safety of those around you.
[3:03:25.580 --> 3:03:30.380]  Well they have said they'll use biological attacks real or promulgated as a pretext
[3:03:30.380 --> 3:03:31.380]  for control.
[3:03:31.380 --> 3:03:36.860]  They've built 36, by the way, I saw a YouTube comment last week, I was talking about 36
[3:03:36.860 --> 3:03:41.820]  level four bio weapons labs and part of the program bio shield, which mainstream news,
[3:03:41.820 --> 3:03:50.460]  Baltimore Sun and others have reported, Steve, are basically fronts for bio weapons development,
[3:03:50.460 --> 3:03:54.700]  and then I had some guy comment about where's Alex's proof, I don't have to sit here on
[3:03:54.700 --> 3:03:58.060]  everything I say and show you a news article, folks.
[3:03:58.060 --> 3:04:02.860]  In fact, in a week or two, I'll say, hey, big Massachusetts police chief says we want
[3:04:02.860 --> 3:04:07.540]  black uniforms to instill fear and intimidate the population, don't email me saying where's
[3:04:07.540 --> 3:04:13.180]  the proof, Google it, I mean today, I'm showing people the article, today I'm showing a menonite
[3:04:13.180 --> 3:04:18.260]  arrested for selling raw milk, but the point is we're not making any of this up, Steve.
[3:04:18.260 --> 3:04:23.060]  No, and the bottom line is, remember, those who always say that on the air, like when
[3:04:23.060 --> 3:04:27.180]  I'm on coast to coast, I mean these guys are government chilled, they are actually paid
[3:04:27.180 --> 3:04:31.500]  to come on and say where's the proof, but lazy, get off your lazy Easter and go Google
[3:04:31.500 --> 3:04:32.980]  it, that's what I tell them now.
[3:04:32.980 --> 3:04:38.460]  Absolutely, well I'm going to put on the document can the Associated Press, okay, Genesis Network,
[3:04:38.460 --> 3:04:42.740]  we'll be back in three minutes, for everybody watching on prisonplanet.tv, we're live right
[3:04:42.740 --> 3:04:43.740]  now.
[3:04:43.740 --> 3:04:50.740]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[3:04:50.740 --> 3:04:55.300]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:04:55.300 --> 3:05:01.300]  It's known as the Bilderberg, but their objective being world domination.
[3:05:01.300 --> 3:05:04.460]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:05:04.460 --> 3:05:10.380]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[3:05:10.380 --> 3:05:14.820]  of humanity is at hand.
[3:05:14.820 --> 3:05:20.260]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:05:20.260 --> 3:05:24.100]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:05:24.100 --> 3:05:26.820]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:05:26.820 --> 3:05:29.940]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need,
[3:05:29.940 --> 3:05:32.140]  they're after power, that's their after-easy.

[3:05:40.580 --> 3:05:45.740]  In-game, blueprint for global enslavement, you have been warned.
[3:05:45.740 --> 3:05:49.060]  Hi neighbor, this is Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[3:05:49.060 --> 3:05:52.460]  Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck.
[3:05:52.460 --> 3:05:57.260]  If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd start immediately
[3:05:57.260 --> 3:06:02.460]  to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible.
[3:06:02.460 --> 3:06:06.780]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is
[3:06:06.780 --> 3:06:12.100]  all that's left, when the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only
[3:06:12.100 --> 3:06:16.940]  chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[3:06:16.940 --> 3:06:20.580]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest
[3:06:20.580 --> 3:06:25.060]  of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[3:06:25.060 --> 3:06:30.580]  Decide, it's food now or probably never, but can you afford to be wrong?
[3:06:30.580 --> 3:06:31.580]  Decide now.
[3:06:31.580 --> 3:06:33.220]  Place your bet.
[3:06:33.220 --> 3:06:34.940]  Can you afford to be wrong?
[3:06:34.940 --> 3:06:40.780]  Call 800-409-5633 on the WebEFoodsDirect.com.
[3:06:40.780 --> 3:06:45.860]  Call 800-409-5633.
[3:06:45.860 --> 3:06:51.020]  You can trace every disease, every illness, and every ailment to mineral deficiency.
[3:06:51.020 --> 3:06:55.900]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling, because fruits and vegetables
[3:06:55.900 --> 3:07:00.060]  in their raw form are better absorbed, retained, and utilized than have heated.
[3:07:00.060 --> 3:07:04.500]  The champion juicer is the best way to get your nutrients, your body craves.
[3:07:04.500 --> 3:07:08.980]  The champion juicer chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits.
[3:07:08.980 --> 3:07:13.020]  This gives you more fiber, enzymes, vitamins, and trace minerals.
[3:07:13.020 --> 3:07:18.380]  Juicing a combination of raw fruits and vegetables is documented to not only treat minor illness,
[3:07:18.380 --> 3:07:23.300]  but also is shown to reverse once-thought incurable life-threatening diseases.
[3:07:23.300 --> 3:07:28.220]  Juicing with the champion juicer also promotes fast, healthy weight loss and pure body cleansing.
[3:07:28.220 --> 3:07:31.060]  Put the champion juicer to work for you and your family.
[3:07:31.060 --> 3:07:35.620]  Be creative with your juicer and add a grain mill attachment to make your own healthy, fresh flower.
[3:07:35.620 --> 3:07:39.860]  The champion juicer also makes great nut butters and frozen sorbets.
[3:07:39.860 --> 3:07:42.460]  The world's finest juicer is champion juicer.

[3:07:46.460 --> 3:07:49.180]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[3:07:49.180 --> 3:07:52.500]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:07:54.700 --> 3:08:00.620]  I remember in 2002 reading that PrimaCoff, the former head of the KGB,
[3:08:00.620 --> 3:08:04.380]  have been hired by the U.S. government to come over and advise.
[3:08:04.380 --> 3:08:05.540]  And I didn't believe it at first.
[3:08:05.540 --> 3:08:09.540]  Then I found the Purchase Order's mainstream news stories,
[3:08:09.540 --> 3:08:15.820]  where they admitted they were hiring hundreds of former KGB, Stasi heads, others,
[3:08:15.820 --> 3:08:19.540]  quote because they knew how to fight terror and knew how to ferret it out.
[3:08:19.540 --> 3:08:22.180]  And then they came over here, the former head of the Stasi,
[3:08:22.180 --> 3:08:25.900]  and he died last year, by the way, and helped set all this up.
[3:08:25.900 --> 3:08:31.340]  And it's just amazing and that Steve has a lot of military sources and people,
[3:08:31.340 --> 3:08:33.260]  which have turned out to be quite accurate in the past.
[3:08:33.260 --> 3:08:34.620]  Steve's not making this stuff up.
[3:08:34.620 --> 3:08:39.580]  Tell us about the internal meetings with PrimaCoff and with Marcus Wolfe,
[3:08:39.580 --> 3:08:43.860]  the head of the Stasi, that some of your sources had and what those were like, Steve.
[3:08:43.860 --> 3:08:48.980]  Well, according to my sources, some of them were absolutely privy to what went on.
[3:08:48.980 --> 3:08:52.420]  And look, the deal is, Alex, PrimaCoff, KGB,
[3:08:52.420 --> 3:08:56.620]  he was also the head of the Middle Eastern branch of the KGB,
[3:08:56.620 --> 3:08:59.100]  Saddam Hussein's envoy, et cetera.
[3:08:59.100 --> 3:09:02.300]  So when you talk about him, you're not talking about a low-level guy.
[3:09:02.300 --> 3:09:05.780]  You're talking about one of the biggest guys in the world and the world of spycraft.
[3:09:05.780 --> 3:09:10.460]  When you're talking about Marcus Wolfe, the Department of Homeland Security has set up its...
[3:09:10.460 --> 3:09:11.660]  Now, this will blow everyone's mind.
[3:09:11.660 --> 3:09:15.580]  It's an entire neighborhood watch program off of the blueprint, if you will,
[3:09:15.580 --> 3:09:19.780]  the PowerPoint presentation that Marcus Wolfe, former head of the Stasi,
[3:09:19.780 --> 3:09:21.300]  let's tell everybody what the Stasi is.
[3:09:21.300 --> 3:09:26.780]  The most repressive secret police regime behind the Iron Curtain
[3:09:26.780 --> 3:09:30.700]  that even gave the KGB and the Romanians a run for their money.
[3:09:30.700 --> 3:09:35.820]  In other words, this wasn't a man who was a functionary at some mid-level.
[3:09:35.820 --> 3:09:37.380]  This was the man.
[3:09:37.380 --> 3:09:40.700]  And I was told by someone who now, I don't even know if they're alive,
[3:09:40.700 --> 3:09:45.660]  a former officer in FEMA, a watch commander.
[3:09:45.660 --> 3:09:48.700]  The point is, I was told that the Department of Homeland Security
[3:09:48.700 --> 3:09:51.820]  is going to have their people in neighborhood watch groups.
[3:09:51.820 --> 3:09:55.940]  And do you know what the number one question that they're prepping everybody for?
[3:09:55.940 --> 3:09:59.780]  Tell on your neighbor that might not be favorable, New World Order.
[3:09:59.780 --> 3:10:06.940]  And when you and I talked about the pastors being solicited to turn in their parishioners...
[3:10:06.940 --> 3:10:08.860]  Yeah, let me throw this in.
[3:10:08.860 --> 3:10:13.740]  Almost two years ago, we broke that here on Genesis, brought that information out.
[3:10:13.740 --> 3:10:19.300]  People said it wasn't true even when we posted secret, marked restricted.
[3:10:19.300 --> 3:10:24.620]  FEMA documents, when they had 13,000 preachers, now it's 26,000, they're going to double that now.
[3:10:24.620 --> 3:10:28.380]  And now news has admitted, and the media said it's good,
[3:10:28.380 --> 3:10:31.220]  they're training you to quote, this is national news and local news,
[3:10:31.220 --> 3:10:37.180]  turn your guns in, hand your guns in, submit, go to FEMA centers, let them take your families.
[3:10:37.180 --> 3:10:38.620]  It's happening.
[3:10:38.620 --> 3:10:39.780]  This isn't a joke.
[3:10:39.780 --> 3:10:47.900]  Now they've recruited 500,000 truck drivers, infra-guard, 26,000, excuse me, 23,000 executives.
[3:10:47.900 --> 3:10:50.300]  They're going to double that again this year.
[3:10:50.300 --> 3:10:57.220]  Now I've got the news here about Associated Press making sure Osama doesn't hijack your bass boat, AP.
[3:10:57.220 --> 3:11:01.020]  A boating session season approaches the Bush administration wants to enlist the country's
[3:11:01.020 --> 3:11:05.100]  80 million recreational boaters to help reduce the chances of a small boat
[3:11:05.100 --> 3:11:10.100]  could be delivered a nuclear radiological bomb somewhere along the country's 95,000 miles of coast.
[3:11:10.100 --> 3:11:12.860]  So they leave the main ports open, let's say internally,
[3:11:12.860 --> 3:11:15.980]  and it says that they're going to give them training seminars, but it says,
[3:11:15.980 --> 3:11:19.900]  when you go to these, we've got video of them, they first say it's about bin Laden,
[3:11:19.900 --> 3:11:23.380]  then they go, by the way, we're fighting marijuana, we're fighting drunk driving,
[3:11:23.380 --> 3:11:27.060]  we're, if you see somebody spanking their child, call the police.
[3:11:27.060 --> 3:11:31.740]  Again, they say on the surface it's about terror, and then they flip it, spy on your neighbor,
[3:11:31.740 --> 3:11:36.940]  and by the way, Steve, you get stuff from secret sources a lot, and the mainstream sources too,
[3:11:36.940 --> 3:11:41.740]  but see, I just go off what they admit, and it meshes with what you just said you got from sources.
[3:11:41.740 --> 3:11:49.060]  There was a Washington Post, AP Post, in October, right during the Patriot Act,
[3:11:49.060 --> 3:11:53.220]  and it said neighborhood watch to work with Homeland Security before they even funded it.
[3:11:53.220 --> 3:11:59.980]  Clinton gave speeches about it in 93, and they said there that don't trust a priest
[3:11:59.980 --> 3:12:06.220]  or a woman with a baby carriage. Al-Qaeda has white people too. Watch everyone.
[3:12:06.220 --> 3:12:10.300]  The feds are going to be over in control of neighborhood watches, and everybody I know,
[3:12:10.300 --> 3:12:14.940]  I mean, I get calls from East Texas, South Texas, Ohio, I see the articles every day,
[3:12:14.940 --> 3:12:20.220]  where FBI sends out flyers to everybody's homes saying, please come to an anti-terror meeting,
[3:12:20.220 --> 3:12:24.220]  and you show up and they say, we want you to spy on your neighbors. Terrorists are everywhere,
[3:12:24.220 --> 3:12:30.460]  there's white Al-Qaeda, tens of thousands of them. By the way, all crime is Al-Qaeda. I mean,
[3:12:30.460 --> 3:12:35.260]  and now in rural areas, if you shoot your gun in the backyard, cops show up and ask why you're
[3:12:35.260 --> 3:12:39.980]  shooting a gun on your ranch. I mean, Steve, it's really happening.
[3:12:39.980 --> 3:12:43.820]  Oh, absolutely. And by the way, the word Al-Qaeda is no longer politically correct.
[3:12:43.820 --> 3:12:50.300]  The word Al-Qaeda, jihadi, Islamofascist is now removed from terrorists and terrorists is anybody
[3:12:50.300 --> 3:12:55.340]  that is not towing the line. And that's it. They always say we don't profile because we're not
[3:12:55.340 --> 3:12:59.900]  racist. No, it's their excuse to go after everybody. Even if you believe these Muslims are doing it on
[3:12:59.900 --> 3:13:05.740]  their own, none of the attack profile has anything to do with them. Well, the point is, Alex, is that
[3:13:05.740 --> 3:13:10.460]  they've generated the problem. They're providing the solution. The solution is simply this,
[3:13:10.460 --> 3:13:14.940]  under the dialectic, all freedom, all freedom. You know, they've even planned that you're going
[3:13:14.940 --> 3:13:21.100]  to only be allowed to eat 1,500 to 1,800 calories a day. Oh, no, they're already in going back five
[3:13:21.100 --> 3:13:26.780]  years taking people's kids in the US and UK. People think it's just for the giant fat kid.
[3:13:26.780 --> 3:13:32.060]  No, they're admitting that they're going to set a very low body weight for everybody. And if you
[3:13:32.060 --> 3:13:36.380]  can't pass it, they're going to take your kids. Well, yeah, I can tell you something when people
[3:13:36.380 --> 3:13:41.820]  say they can't. My answer and your answer are the same. They are doing it now. They, well,
[3:13:41.820 --> 3:13:46.140]  that's unconstitutional. Well, this is the issue. This is the issue. We've gone from 300,000 cops
[3:13:46.140 --> 3:13:51.340]  to 2 million. They're talking about doubling that again. But when my car gets stolen or my house
[3:13:51.340 --> 3:13:55.340]  gets broken into, the police won't come out. When there were 300,000 cops, 12 years ago,
[3:13:55.340 --> 3:14:00.860]  they'd come out. Now they won't come out. This is about us. Yeah, that's because their model used
[3:14:00.860 --> 3:14:07.500]  to be to protect and serve. That's it. They're looking, Stevie's bring up so many points. They're
[3:14:07.500 --> 3:14:12.860]  looking for things to attack in our lives. And I'm not attacking the average cop, but it's designed.
[3:14:12.860 --> 3:14:18.140]  It is for us. It is for the general public. Go ahead. Right. It's gone from protect and serve
[3:14:18.140 --> 3:14:22.940]  to target and destroy. Listen, I've got to tell you this, even in Montana, you've got the Department
[3:14:22.940 --> 3:14:28.300]  of Homeland Security, you've got all these black Durangos with Emmys, you know, basically cruising
[3:14:28.300 --> 3:14:34.220]  the highways. I mean, the fact is that people have got to understand we're not the enemy,
[3:14:34.220 --> 3:14:38.860]  and they don't care about your task. What about their families? Their families, those who
[3:14:38.860 --> 3:14:44.700]  believe will be pipwacked or they'll be rescued just up a secret place. The point is that it's
[3:14:44.700 --> 3:14:49.980]  the total destination. See, these guys are willing to. Again, Alex, we plead with those in the military
[3:14:49.980 --> 3:14:54.300]  and law enforcement communities that think that somehow they're just going to round up all the
[3:14:54.300 --> 3:14:58.780]  crazies and they get to live. No, you guys, the very same people that are destroying us and
[3:14:58.780 --> 3:15:04.940]  mind controlling you. And let me share this. The weather modification, the Bernhard Eastland,
[3:15:04.940 --> 3:15:11.740]  the hard patent designer died, but the point is, is that the mind control, people that challenge
[3:15:11.740 --> 3:15:17.340]  you and I would just get off their lazy fingers and type in mind control patents, they're going to
[3:15:17.340 --> 3:15:23.820]  find out that all of the strange electromagnetic phenomenon that can be experienced in the sky,
[3:15:23.820 --> 3:15:29.340]  the moray patterns, that would be the cloud patterns, the striations, all that stuff is indicative
[3:15:29.340 --> 3:15:34.700]  that, look, specific frequencies can generate anger. They can generate lethargy. They can
[3:15:34.700 --> 3:15:40.460]  generate, they can put you to sleep and all of them. Let me stop you. There was another Baltimore
[3:15:40.460 --> 3:15:45.740]  Sun article in 2002, and I've got it around here somewhere. I want somebody to dig it up on the
[3:15:45.740 --> 3:15:50.140]  web and find it and post it on thepresidentplanet.com forums or something because I remember all this
[3:15:50.140 --> 3:15:54.460]  stuff. Just like in six months, I'll say, remember that police chief who said they want, they wear
[3:15:54.460 --> 3:15:58.620]  black uniforms to intimidate us. Well, I read that in documents, you know, five years, six years ago,
[3:15:58.620 --> 3:16:03.260]  but point is here it is today. We won't remember that in a few months, exactly where it came from.
[3:16:03.260 --> 3:16:08.620]  But it said that DARPA wasn't just working on brain scanners for the airports, but they were
[3:16:08.620 --> 3:16:13.740]  working on aggressive systems to calm whole crowds. And it said they were going to use
[3:16:13.740 --> 3:16:19.660]  added systems on cell phone towers to put out wavelengths to calm and soothe the steering
[3:16:19.660 --> 3:16:26.380]  emergencies. And so there it, it's admitted what you just said. Absolutely. You see, nothing,
[3:16:26.380 --> 3:16:31.340]  I tell people, I've done my homework. So before you come after me or come after Alex, you go do
[3:16:31.340 --> 3:16:36.060]  your homework. You know, I don't think people realize how much time that you and I spend doing
[3:16:36.060 --> 3:16:41.580]  this stuff. And we do check our sources. We do basically try and get two, three times a witness.
[3:16:41.580 --> 3:16:46.220]  In other words, it's got to be more than just one person saying it. Yet when it's all said and done,
[3:16:46.220 --> 3:16:52.780]  Alex, it's just, oh, well, what's the newest Hollywood starlet that's having sexual issues?
[3:16:52.780 --> 3:16:58.300]  Or, you know, what's the nonsense of this ad nauseam political process? Look, the very
[3:16:58.300 --> 3:17:03.980]  country is at stake. People who think that they're going to get a change in Obama or Hillary
[3:17:03.980 --> 3:17:09.180]  or John McCain. Look, as the former head of the fed told a friend of mine, he put his arm around
[3:17:09.180 --> 3:17:16.460]  him, not, not Greenspan. And this gentleman, a tall man said, hell, son, we own them all. And
[3:17:16.460 --> 3:17:20.060]  again, you've done shows on the Federal Reserve. I've done them until, you know, I don't want to
[3:17:20.060 --> 3:17:24.860]  do them anymore because look, it's not a question of just understanding what's happening. It's
[3:17:24.860 --> 3:17:29.900]  that under the point is you have to use all this knowledge to basically get yourself,
[3:17:29.900 --> 3:17:34.220]  your family, your loved ones out of harm's way. And I want to explain the mindset here for people,
[3:17:34.220 --> 3:17:40.540]  though, Steve, I want to explain the mindset of these elites because, you know, and even the low
[3:17:40.540 --> 3:17:43.820]  level minion thinks they're part of the elite when they talk about, yes, son, we own them all,
[3:17:44.380 --> 3:17:49.420]  just like the high level, the genetic engineering, the fact that their grandkids are eating GMO foods
[3:17:49.420 --> 3:17:53.900]  that are hurting them badly. The fact that I see Bill Clinton on TV drinking Diet Coke,
[3:17:53.900 --> 3:17:59.180]  they don't even care about themselves. It's just like, I don't care, kill, kill, kill. It is just
[3:17:59.180 --> 3:18:05.580]  such an evil mindset spirit that they have. Absolutely. The real powers that be, as was
[3:18:05.580 --> 3:18:10.380]  told to me by one of the most famous coal war spies, face-to-face, he said, Steve, the real
[3:18:10.380 --> 3:18:15.100]  powers that be, you've never seen their faces on TV. So that just iterates and basically
[3:18:15.100 --> 3:18:19.100]  illustrates your point, Alex. And here's the thing that you've got to understand. This thing
[3:18:19.100 --> 3:18:23.100]  is happening. Did you notice too, you know, the most mind-blowing thing in the last two weeks
[3:18:23.100 --> 3:18:27.980]  is almost instantly the rice famine happened overnight. Did you notice that? It wasn't even
[3:18:27.980 --> 3:18:32.700]  24 hours, 12 hours. They're really pushing it. Yep, they're really pushing it. And then the
[3:18:32.700 --> 3:18:37.500]  point is, you know why? They're going to basically drive people to do what they told them to do,
[3:18:37.500 --> 3:18:40.860]  prepare for all this stuff, and then they're going to turn right around and go after the
[3:18:40.860 --> 3:18:44.140]  preparers legally. I got to tell you something. When they're going to take away your life,
[3:18:44.140 --> 3:18:46.460]  when they're going to take away your wife, when they're going to take away your kids,
[3:18:46.460 --> 3:18:49.260]  when they're going to take away your future, when they're going to take away your hope,
[3:18:49.260 --> 3:18:55.340]  your financial ability and your job, then you got to say, you know, it's time to really speak up
[3:18:55.340 --> 3:19:00.220]  until I can no longer speak up. And then basically, if they come to take your life,
[3:19:00.220 --> 3:19:06.380]  God's given us all that mandate to basically self-protection, okay? And the thing is,
[3:19:06.380 --> 3:19:11.100]  is that I hear people arguing with me. I've got Christians, okay? Obviously, a lot of
[3:19:11.100 --> 3:19:14.940]  Christians listen to your show, listen to mine, but they tell me, oh, I'm just going to go into a
[3:19:14.940 --> 3:19:17.820]  camp and be a witness for Jesus. They tell them they won't get a chance to open their mouth.
[3:19:17.820 --> 3:19:21.340]  Well, they've been trained. Suddenly, you see all the big preachers saying,
[3:19:21.340 --> 3:19:25.660]  it's good to be a slave of the government. That's a quote. It's good to be a slave. Submit
[3:19:25.660 --> 3:19:31.660]  all government as of God. That's a lie. Well, Steve, stay there. I'm going to just keep Steve
[3:19:31.660 --> 3:19:35.420]  rolling, John, during this break, and we'll come right back on the other side of the break. And I
[3:19:35.420 --> 3:19:39.260]  promise, go directly to your phone calls. This is so important right now, though, on my internet
[3:19:39.260 --> 3:19:42.780]  streams. We're going to continue the radio show. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[3:19:42.780 --> 3:19:51.340]  It is a big idea. A New World Order. In the near future,
[3:19:52.060 --> 3:19:57.980]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the Bilderberg group.
[3:19:57.980 --> 3:20:03.340]  Could their objective be world domination? For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:20:03.980 --> 3:20:09.980]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[3:20:09.980 --> 3:20:18.220]  of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government
[3:20:18.220 --> 3:20:23.580]  is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[3:20:23.580 --> 3:20:27.340]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea.

[3:23:53.180 --> 3:23:57.900]  I was thinking during the break and talking to Steve quail Steve quail.com
[3:23:57.900 --> 3:24:09.020]  I was thinking about the fact that they had hundreds of thousands of new cases of TB in
[3:24:09.020 --> 3:24:14.220]  the last couple years. They've got huge TB facilities now very quietly with drug resistant
[3:24:14.220 --> 3:24:20.140]  immune TB people dying. Leprosy has gone from no cases to tens of thousands a year. Government's
[3:24:20.140 --> 3:24:25.820]  own numbers. You're not supposed to talk about that but that's nothing compared to these gene
[3:24:25.820 --> 3:24:32.540]  guns thousands of factories randomly shooting genes into the DNA of plants animals humans embryos
[3:24:32.540 --> 3:24:38.380]  giving rise to super viruses all sorts of weird genetically modified thongus is killing trees
[3:24:38.380 --> 3:24:43.900]  I've seen the university reports that it's GMO doing it the bees dying and that's nothing I've
[3:24:43.900 --> 3:24:47.420]  had Nobel prize winners on who were making millions of bucks a year making this stuff and they said
[3:24:47.420 --> 3:24:52.780]  look all of the mice would die all the guinea pigs would die all the rats would die they would get
[3:24:52.780 --> 3:24:58.780]  it deformities after utero which we thought was impossible these aren't cancers these are mutations
[3:24:58.780 --> 3:25:04.380]  while they're alive that are non cancer related I mean this is like the movies where you mutate
[3:25:04.380 --> 3:25:10.780]  right there you know in the course of months and now that we're all eating it it's all happening
[3:25:11.420 --> 3:25:16.220]  again you get back to the elite they just want to kill people they want to screw it
[3:25:16.220 --> 3:25:22.060]  Monsanto said in 99 in a public statement they were going to infect the entire biosphere then
[3:25:22.060 --> 3:25:26.700]  claim ownership of it with their GMO Steve Cuell we're going to go to the calls here in a moment
[3:25:26.700 --> 3:25:30.860]  but I mean these people are just out of their minds well done we are they're out of their minds
[3:25:30.860 --> 3:25:35.580]  because they have a mind of collective evil that is kind of like the Borg version of
[3:25:36.620 --> 3:25:42.700]  Luciferianism on steroids okay I don't know any way to be more pronounced that we were talking
[3:25:42.700 --> 3:25:48.620]  Alex off air that the bats and the bees dying gee does anybody ever think that the stuff that
[3:25:48.620 --> 3:25:53.500]  will kill humans that's on a schedule for with the environmental protection agency that's sprayed in
[3:25:53.500 --> 3:25:59.020]  aerosol form might be killing the bats and bees let me tell you this I've been told by someone who
[3:25:59.020 --> 3:26:04.300]  is no longer with the federal government I don't know if they're alive or dead my prayer is that
[3:26:04.300 --> 3:26:10.940]  they're alive the bottom line is is that the reason the bats are dying that the diseases that are
[3:26:10.940 --> 3:26:16.460]  going to be released will be infected in the insect population obviously bats are a responsible
[3:26:16.460 --> 3:26:22.940]  pollination as bees are but the point that I don't think people are putting two and two together on
[3:26:22.940 --> 3:26:29.020]  is that the entire if you will created realm of God's splendor and excellence is under attack
[3:26:29.020 --> 3:26:36.380]  and we're coming into this dark man-made God-like complex that says that men in their rebellion
[3:26:36.380 --> 3:26:42.220]  in their total denial of the king of glory can do what they please and they don't need God well
[3:26:42.220 --> 3:26:48.140]  that's the thing if you go to the superconducting you know heavy collider in Switzerland they got
[3:26:48.140 --> 3:26:52.540]  videos on there where they're saying we don't know what it'll do and then they admit yeah it could
[3:26:52.540 --> 3:26:58.300]  create black holes yeah it could create a strange lit yeah it could destroy the earth and we're just
[3:26:58.300 --> 3:27:01.820]  going to do it we're going to do all these tests and we're going to collide heavy particles together
[3:27:01.820 --> 3:27:07.740]  and the equation show it could cause you know huge problems but you know we've just it's this crazy
[3:27:07.740 --> 3:27:12.940]  I mean I've got this clip of these transhumans talking about how they want to kill everybody and
[3:27:12.940 --> 3:27:18.460]  you know how the Terrans will die and all this I mean these people are nuts I mean they just
[3:27:18.460 --> 3:27:23.820]  but they're not only nuts but they're remember they're not insane they are focused they are
[3:27:23.820 --> 3:27:29.500]  determined they are well funded these guys use the money that gives them the power and the ultimate
[3:27:29.500 --> 3:27:33.980]  power of life and death it's the same thing when I've seen the the chimeras if you will
[3:27:33.980 --> 3:27:40.060]  the transgenic human animal hybrids you don't see anything that looks you know warm and cuddly
[3:27:40.060 --> 3:27:46.220]  these are some of the most horrific nightmarish like creations out there by the way mythology was
[3:27:46.220 --> 3:27:50.860]  based on a lot of stuff has already been Solomon said there's nothing new and it's on that which
[3:27:50.860 --> 3:27:56.540]  will be has already been but when you're talking about opening up portals I can tell you point
[3:27:56.540 --> 3:28:03.180]  blank that dealing with stargates is probably one of the most difficult thing for people to wrap
[3:28:03.180 --> 3:28:07.420]  their minds around Jesus said this that he's going to build his church on faith in the living
[3:28:07.420 --> 3:28:11.820]  god and that the gates of hell will not prevail everybody said well what's the gate of hell you
[3:28:11.820 --> 3:28:15.660]  know they think like unfortunately somebody's going to chase you around with a I guess like
[3:28:15.660 --> 3:28:21.580]  rod iron gate that's not what he meant so we're in a time period now where the prophecies that
[3:28:21.580 --> 3:28:26.060]  were sealed up for so many years are coming forward I'm not talking about Dostradamus
[3:28:26.060 --> 3:28:32.380]  mothers shipped in and all this stuff I'm talking about specific statements as to the time that
[3:28:32.380 --> 3:28:36.620]  we live in men's hearts failing them for fear of looking after those things coming upon the earth
[3:28:36.620 --> 3:28:41.580]  listen Alex the seismic stuff I just posted a website out of India I posted a story on my
[3:28:41.580 --> 3:28:48.140]  website out of India about a pilot flying at you know 20,000 feet that sees a huge wave
[3:28:48.140 --> 3:28:55.020]  from 20,000 feet calls it in and they warn of the nicobar island region of the area that was
[3:28:55.020 --> 3:29:00.060]  wiped out by the tsunami in 2004 the point is they they warned them about that and the deal is guess
[3:29:00.060 --> 3:29:06.300]  what not one mention of this do you know how tall a wave would have to be to be seen from that distance
[3:29:06.940 --> 3:29:12.860]  I mean huge so so the point is that's where we're at we're at we're at a period where Steve
[3:29:12.860 --> 3:29:17.820]  Steve stay there on the internet side of this broadcast I'm going to take some calls from the
[3:29:17.820 --> 3:29:24.140]  512-646-5400 they're in the stream in a break and we'll come back on the main network transmission
[3:29:24.140 --> 3:29:29.740]  right now if folks want to hear this go to the info wars.com streams right now and click on those
[3:29:29.740 --> 3:29:37.020]  streams to hear Steve and I so that's how you're able to tune into that we will continue we're on
[3:29:37.020 --> 3:29:43.500]  the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[3:29:49.260 --> 3:29:53.020]  hi this is Alex Jones and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline

[3:33:12.460 --> 3:33:16.460]  from it steve and then harvey i want you to finish up your point because you bring up a key point
[3:33:16.460 --> 3:33:21.420]  you were talking about the elite i was talking about these transhumanist top top weapons makers
[3:33:21.420 --> 3:33:26.860]  billionaires they're all part of the same clubs i use the dr peonka case he's one of tens of thousands
[3:33:26.860 --> 3:33:32.220]  of top professors at ut here in austin who went to an award ceremony with over a thousand people
[3:33:32.220 --> 3:33:37.900]  and the paper reported he got a 95 standing ovation when he would show an image of red skulls
[3:33:38.700 --> 3:33:44.140]  and say 90 of us will die it's going to be wonderful i know my family's going to die too
[3:33:44.140 --> 3:33:48.860]  you go to his website at the university of texas he's dressed up like a druid he says he's a druid
[3:33:48.860 --> 3:33:54.300]  he says i love lucifer on the website you can't focus this is not a joke this is the ut website
[3:33:54.300 --> 3:34:00.860]  of the sky you say well he's just a nut you know he's just a nut biologist no he has access to weapons
[3:34:00.860 --> 3:34:06.140]  laboratories ut has level four weapons labs in their biology department he has access to the
[3:34:06.140 --> 3:34:10.540]  to the nuke reactor they have in austin you tell the public there's a nuke they've been preconditioned
[3:34:10.540 --> 3:34:15.820]  to say there's not a research nuke at the jj pickle research laboratory in north austin
[3:34:15.820 --> 3:34:22.540]  off a breaker lane in mopac uh but again 95 where it went on for minutes the papers reported just
[3:34:22.540 --> 3:34:31.660]  yes kill them kill us kill oh death oh oh murder oh god death oh oh yes i mean steve i don't think
[3:34:31.660 --> 3:34:37.260]  they understand this is their spirit they just oh murder everyone murder and kill children murder
[3:34:37.260 --> 3:34:42.140]  death blood oh god it's beautiful you know they said hitler would go to the front lines and watch
[3:34:42.140 --> 3:34:47.740]  with his binoculars for hours burning cities and death and would go inspect dead bodies at hospitals
[3:34:47.740 --> 3:34:54.940]  and just oh black uniforms it's black stuka bombers black smoke death piles of dead bodies oh it's so
[3:34:54.940 --> 3:35:00.220]  beautiful i mean i don't think they can understand that steve i think that the deal is is that all
[3:35:00.220 --> 3:35:05.580]  those that hate god love death you see that's something that that listen jesus said he has come
[3:35:05.580 --> 3:35:11.100]  that we might have life and have it more abundantly okay god is life god listen i look at the sky
[3:35:11.100 --> 3:35:15.260]  when it's not chemtrail they look at the mountains the sea everything that's beautiful
[3:35:15.260 --> 3:35:22.780]  everything that was wonderful and these absolutely uh uh maggots from the cauldron of hell want to
[3:35:22.780 --> 3:35:28.300]  destroy all that because they hate the very image of god and i gotta tell you something else again
[3:35:28.300 --> 3:35:34.300]  unless a person understands spiritual warfare you see these people believe that in committing
[3:35:34.300 --> 3:35:40.300]  if you will genocide that they they get power they get power yes they get power but also
[3:35:40.300 --> 3:35:44.700]  look you know if i told you that the world's leaders get together even the guys you think
[3:35:44.700 --> 3:35:49.020]  are antagonists and sacrifice small children to things that most people don't even believe that
[3:35:49.020 --> 3:35:55.580]  exist people say oh man that's just bloody stuff but yet these people derive a a thrill if you will
[3:35:55.580 --> 3:36:01.180]  it's almost like a not only an intellectual cannibalism but it's an emotional cannibalism
[3:36:01.180 --> 3:36:06.780]  and it's a total contempt first for god now let's just say this if we're even the atheists
[3:36:06.780 --> 3:36:11.420]  and agnostics they can try and say well everything is chemically determined that free will is just
[3:36:11.420 --> 3:36:17.020]  nothing but a response of different proteins to different forces no the bottom line is wires are
[3:36:17.020 --> 3:36:22.540]  this overruling overriding clapping our own destruction look isn't amazing that why are the
[3:36:22.540 --> 3:36:28.220]  global is so obsessed with behavioral psychology and programming us and showing us acts of murder
[3:36:28.220 --> 3:36:34.220]  and violence they admit to program us an aclimatus right they're desensitizing us to the great kill
[3:36:34.220 --> 3:36:40.940]  that's coming okay listen alex i have wept my heart is broken for what's coming if one person
[3:36:40.940 --> 3:36:45.420]  two people two thousand two hundred thousand two million listen to you and i and they're not one
[3:36:45.420 --> 3:36:49.340]  of those see i told the guy once on the air is give me a hard time on another talk show
[3:36:49.340 --> 3:36:53.020]  i said look at the difference between you and i and this person was arguing it'd be good for
[3:36:53.020 --> 3:36:58.300]  all these people guys like i said yeah uh that's in your world in my world life is precious life
[3:36:58.300 --> 3:37:02.380]  is wonderful well no i mean most americans even if they agree with us about the new world they go
[3:37:02.380 --> 3:37:08.300]  but we are overpopulated i mean even um you know even the head of the 700 club said china needs to
[3:37:08.300 --> 3:37:13.500]  have abortion uh you know it's of the lord and we must do what the government says i mean that's
[3:37:13.500 --> 3:37:19.980]  how sick this perversion is that that that it just pervades everything don't they understand
[3:37:19.980 --> 3:37:25.260]  that if one person's life has been devalued everybody's is absolutely and see i would i would
[3:37:25.260 --> 3:37:29.740]  want to take on that spokesman you know as a matter of fact i debate him publicly i know who
[3:37:29.740 --> 3:37:34.460]  said that i would also tell you this but the big and that robertson yes you and i were talking
[3:37:34.460 --> 3:37:39.580]  uh off the air i think we were out there and talking about the big televangels have already
[3:37:39.580 --> 3:37:44.140]  bought the lie okay they're willing to sacrifice the sheep because they get to keep the cash and
[3:37:44.140 --> 3:37:49.260]  goodies you know the point is is that the cash and goodies i can't i can't even imagine what
[3:37:49.260 --> 3:37:55.180]  it's gonna be like to basically be a pastor look a pastor's supposed to be a shepherd not a butcher
[3:37:55.180 --> 3:38:01.660]  okay but uh i mean how could you eat how could you betray people how i mean i mean i mean i couldn't
[3:38:01.660 --> 3:38:06.940]  sell out even if i wanted to it's like who i am is fighting these people it's in my very gut
[3:38:06.940 --> 3:38:12.060]  i just go with what's right and standing up to evil it's not even a conscious thing steve
[3:38:12.060 --> 3:38:17.500]  but with them they just love their little pimp outfits and their fancy suits and they love lying
[3:38:17.500 --> 3:38:23.020]  and being being being wicked it's so deceptive oh yeah and the bottom line is but i've got the
[3:38:23.020 --> 3:38:27.980]  answer to that jesus said the love of money is the root of all evil it's not that money is evil
[3:38:27.980 --> 3:38:33.660]  but all these televangels have one thing in common okay and that's their pocketbook it doesn't matter
[3:38:33.660 --> 3:38:39.900]  you can name anybody of the top ten and they're all up there in the hundred billion plus bracket
[3:38:39.900 --> 3:38:45.100]  okay but they go to las vegas and own race horses for the lord you got it you know and the and the
[3:38:45.100 --> 3:38:51.580]  point is see for me money is nothing but fuel i need money so i can be strong to fight them
[3:38:51.580 --> 3:38:56.380]  if i need to to defend myself and to pay my employees but other than that it is actually a
[3:38:56.380 --> 3:39:03.340]  hassle things are a hassle they annoy me dealing with them annoys me um god we're in trouble steve
[3:39:03.340 --> 3:39:10.620]  i want to go back to calls on finish harvey anything else yes alex i uh i'll remind people
[3:39:10.620 --> 3:39:16.060]  to go to genzyme transgenic corporation on any internet search engine and then i wanted to remind
[3:39:16.060 --> 3:39:21.980]  you i sent you a piece this morning an npr broadcast from this morning was an interview with
[3:39:21.980 --> 3:39:29.020]  anthony scalia he has a new book out and he's gone all over the place first he said that uh
[3:39:29.020 --> 3:39:36.940]  george bersta first is a wonderful gentleman his voice and he said this his voice his face
[3:39:37.740 --> 3:39:45.820]  why now this is in reference to himself why should he have to show them except where he says so
[3:39:45.820 --> 3:39:50.940]  because the interviewer was asking him well how come you're just popping up now how come you don't
[3:39:50.940 --> 3:39:59.180]  face the reporters and this the map and he says why should he have to show his face or his voice
[3:39:59.180 --> 3:40:05.420]  when they're monitoring and scanning every single person in this country oh yeah it's it's total
[3:40:05.420 --> 3:40:10.220]  error against i appreciate your call yeah we we already knew this but the san francisco papers
[3:40:10.780 --> 3:40:14.620]  about several big papers last week admitted that uh million it's right at a million it's
[3:40:14.620 --> 3:40:21.820]  996 000 plus police their families and government workers don't get tickets don't get dwi's their
[3:40:21.820 --> 3:40:26.700]  plates literally are they're ordered not to stop them to leave them alone so they just it's like
[3:40:26.700 --> 3:40:32.700]  diplomatic community government is making itself god well absolutely and that's the case of rome
[3:40:32.700 --> 3:40:38.700]  you talked about roman's 13 off here what people don't understand is roman's 13 will be wrongly used
[3:40:38.700 --> 3:40:44.380]  to get christians to be a christian look jesus made it clear brother's gonna rise against father
[3:40:44.380 --> 3:40:49.900]  mother sister daughter every relationship and he was talking to believers is going to be tempted
[3:40:49.900 --> 3:40:55.500]  tested and the thing is is that it's one thing to say i'll never betray you peter said that boy
[3:40:55.500 --> 3:41:01.660]  before the rooster what got crowed three times it was a done deal i would say this by the grace of
[3:41:01.660 --> 3:41:08.860]  god and through the through the intervention of the mercy and the active agency of god being god
[3:41:08.860 --> 3:41:13.340]  that's how we're gonna basically be able to deal with all the stuff the same way god dealt with
[3:41:13.340 --> 3:41:19.260]  shatrack nisha can offend to go on the fire daniel in the lion's den joseph in prison and every
[3:41:19.260 --> 3:41:25.500]  single man or woman of god in the old or new testament it's not by might nor by power by his
[3:41:25.500 --> 3:41:31.420]  spirit well i just hope police out there know that uh that regardless they're having their pension
[3:41:31.420 --> 3:41:36.300]  funds taken the whole economy gone you're being poisoned just like us whatever's coming we're
[3:41:36.300 --> 3:41:40.780]  not kidding the people running things love death and they love the little black uniforms you wear
[3:41:40.780 --> 3:41:46.780]  and they love and they love making you servants of evil and uh i just hope that uh you haven't
[3:41:46.780 --> 3:41:53.180]  completely lost your soul well some of them have you know to lose their soul to willingly lose
[3:41:53.180 --> 3:41:57.180]  their soul i mean some of these people are going to go hang themselves like judas okay but there
[3:41:57.180 --> 3:42:01.420]  comes a time in the book of revelation where men will seek death and they won't be able to find it
[3:42:01.420 --> 3:42:06.380]  i mean they'll try and kill themselves but they won't be able to uh do it in other words alex
[3:42:06.380 --> 3:42:12.700]  what we're trying to do is we're really pleading our case and not only in the court of public opinion
[3:42:12.700 --> 3:42:18.460]  but in the uh uh logic and the heart of hearts of the men and women and the and the young people
[3:42:18.460 --> 3:42:25.420]  are listening to us to say look understand this isn't a dry run we've seen this before nazi germany
[3:42:25.420 --> 3:42:30.380]  there was a reason we took all the german intelligence uh agents and the german scientists
[3:42:30.380 --> 3:42:35.980]  in operation paper clip the united states when we had the os s the former of the cia isn't a
[3:42:35.980 --> 3:42:41.260]  strange at the country that supposedly is steamed human life at one point now takes
[3:42:41.260 --> 3:42:47.420]  so willy nilly at the other i'm appalled i'm against torture you and i did a uh time together
[3:42:47.420 --> 3:42:55.020]  an interview on torture the bottom line is is it's un un un uh defensible and if christian
[3:42:55.020 --> 3:43:01.100]  is in favor of torture i would say this a guy gets to get on his face and repent it's wrong
[3:43:01.100 --> 3:43:05.420]  absolutely let's take some network calls tony in arkansas you're on the air with steve quayle
[3:43:05.420 --> 3:43:09.420]  thanks for holding uh it's a wonderful to hear both of you together it's kind of like having
[3:43:09.420 --> 3:43:14.540]  superman and batman against the new world order haha um a gentleman i did we kind of almost
[3:43:14.540 --> 3:43:18.700]  stole my thunder a little bit earlier i just wanted to highlight uh the earthquakes um
[3:43:19.340 --> 3:43:24.220]  tuesday night april fifteenth uh just this one little sentence i'd like to read you from a news
[3:43:24.220 --> 3:43:29.340]  report a number of people living in indiana towns of kokomo and longs excuse me logan's port
[3:43:29.340 --> 3:43:33.500]  reported seeing strange lights in the skies hearing what sounded like a huge explosion and
[3:43:33.500 --> 3:43:38.540]  seeing a giant fireball and that was tuesday night it continued wednesday and thursday
[3:43:38.540 --> 3:43:44.940]  and led into the earthquake on friday that is a smoking gun meanwhile dalis news is showing
[3:43:44.940 --> 3:43:50.780]  giant blimp like ufo's guaranteed government they are just involved in all sorts of bizarreness
[3:43:50.780 --> 3:43:54.540]  right now well yeah and then as you both know dick you know nick baggage and you guys have
[3:43:54.540 --> 3:44:00.940]  done things on harp harp when they heat that ionosphere uh it produces a minor sort of uh
[3:44:00.940 --> 3:44:05.660]  i want to say northern light a lot of times it even ignites yes and there was the smell they said
[3:44:05.660 --> 3:44:12.220]  of ozone and that is a to me a smoking gun that they are introducing these earthquakes and it
[3:44:12.220 --> 3:44:16.300]  could be indeed and you guys comment on it my fear is that one of the executive orders bush
[3:44:16.300 --> 3:44:21.180]  is handed down in the last like two years was that in the event of natural disasters as well
[3:44:21.180 --> 3:44:27.100]  a massive enough he can you know that's pdd that's pd51 that or any reason let me i mean how big a
[3:44:27.100 --> 3:44:32.220]  deal is that's the thank you caller how big a deal is that steve quail that the government is saying
[3:44:32.220 --> 3:44:36.940]  in john warren defense authorization act that it's to suppress the american people quote against
[3:44:36.940 --> 3:44:42.620]  insurrection and that the governors aren't even in place automatically but now the entire homeland
[3:44:42.620 --> 3:44:47.980]  security department for a year is not allowed to see any of the plan well absolutely and i think
[3:44:47.980 --> 3:44:54.300]  the caller is very very astute i commend him the bottom line is what he's talking about is some form
[3:44:54.300 --> 3:45:02.060]  of a plasma based or plasma initiated uh a tectonic weapon some of those devices that people are seeing
[3:45:02.060 --> 3:45:07.260]  ufo's or ifo's i call them ifo's i know what we are what they are as a matter of fact they're guys
[3:45:07.260 --> 3:45:14.620]  that listen to you alex and me that uh came out of that world of skunkworks type aircraft well
[3:45:14.620 --> 3:45:18.940]  sure i mean they admitted that people saw the b2 bomber and thought it for 20 years thought it was
[3:45:18.940 --> 3:45:26.220]  a you know flying uh wedge uh martian and it's not it's it's it's our aircraft right but see the
[3:45:26.220 --> 3:45:30.540]  thing and i want to really get this across i don't think i want people to understand it's
[3:45:30.540 --> 3:45:34.940]  critical real quick there are factions in our military that are a war with each other they
[3:45:34.940 --> 3:45:41.020]  are killing each other when you hear of a training accident or you hear of this or that or you know
[3:45:41.020 --> 3:45:45.420]  this group uh having accidents those aren't accidents those are happening there is a fight
[3:45:45.420 --> 3:45:50.620]  there's the good guys and there's a bad guy the bad guys want to do world order and they are out
[3:45:50.620 --> 3:45:55.820]  and out lose experience when you talk about weapons that can generate an earthquake you're
[3:45:55.820 --> 3:46:02.700]  talking about a form of energy that can uh interfere with what's called the electronics
[3:46:02.700 --> 3:46:08.220]  electron spin rate of matter itself okay anti-matter well they admit that the earth actually
[3:46:08.220 --> 3:46:12.860]  accelerated its rotation last year absolutely first time they recorded that but it was almost
[3:46:12.860 --> 3:46:17.100]  a second but but but but it's close to a second was a particle of that a piece of that but but
[3:46:17.100 --> 3:46:23.500]  expanding on that here's just a layman example low level admitted uh the last a couple decades
[3:46:23.500 --> 3:46:27.980]  they've been putting out these powerful sonar systems to detect submarines which every time
[3:46:27.980 --> 3:46:32.940]  they turn them on and and and that's at a low level just testing them whales everywhere die
[3:46:32.940 --> 3:46:37.820]  and beats themselves and they know it's doing and they just don't care well again you know a third
[3:46:37.820 --> 3:46:43.100]  of the life in the sea is is dying i'd be surprised we're not there already as oh no when i was a
[3:46:43.100 --> 3:46:49.420]  kid going out of the texas gulf fishing was 500 easier better yeah i'm just telling you i believe
[3:46:49.420 --> 3:46:55.900]  that the pacific salmon that there's no fishing a pacific salmon uh in the uh oceans off of the
[3:46:55.900 --> 3:46:59.420]  pacific northwest because they're just aren't enough i know someone that worked at the fish
[3:46:59.420 --> 3:47:03.980]  ladder at the bonneville dam or whatever and i mean you know where they used to count thousands
[3:47:03.980 --> 3:47:08.620]  of so many hours i mean they count uh you know dozens so many hours meanwhile they're destroying
[3:47:08.620 --> 3:47:13.340]  the entire real environment while saying they need a global tax against humans in the words of
[3:47:13.340 --> 3:47:19.420]  richard and haas where they say the cfr says it's not real they're so arrogant but we're going to
[3:47:19.420 --> 3:47:25.900]  use it as an organizing effect to say that humans are the enemy that's a quote absolutely and so
[3:47:25.900 --> 3:47:31.980]  carbon dioxide that plants breathe that plant that that that that plankton breathe that's bad
[3:47:31.980 --> 3:47:38.140]  but toxic waste and chimeras that's good well this is nothing more than supercharge
[3:47:38.140 --> 3:47:45.740]  henry kissinger creating a global control mechanism and book no they say social workers in your house
[3:47:45.740 --> 3:47:50.860]  everything regulated how much food you get taxes on your footprint you get this much and then
[3:47:50.860 --> 3:47:56.700]  everything else is a carbon footprint tax total regulation shutting down family farms animal id
[3:47:56.700 --> 3:48:02.300]  premise society all happening bureaucrats harassing everyone millions and millions of new bureaucrats
[3:48:02.300 --> 3:48:07.340]  every year my my gosh let's take another call here uh ian in new york you're on the air go ahead
[3:48:09.740 --> 3:48:14.780]  okay ian okay who's up next on your line anthony and pa you're on the air go ahead
[3:48:15.820 --> 3:48:21.500]  yeah my question was um religious base uh off the bible not i'm no stardom or any aspect okay go
[3:48:21.500 --> 3:48:28.060]  ahead sir um i was curious what how you feel about the uh prophecy of essentially the one world
[3:48:28.060 --> 3:48:33.260]  government ending what do you think it will be uh 2012 event as in do you think we're in the days
[3:48:33.260 --> 3:48:38.060]  of noah do you think that will ultimately be the end okay well let's steve answer that what i do is
[3:48:38.860 --> 3:48:44.940]  i just in from a secular angle as a news person cover what i know what i can prove what i can show
[3:48:44.940 --> 3:48:53.820]  so in the in the main line well i think to put it into perspective i i i might the basis of my book
[3:48:53.820 --> 3:49:00.300]  on genetic armageddon armageddon was that you know that we are in the day 10 percent uh so that's
[3:49:00.300 --> 3:49:05.260]  basically what we're talking about here uh steve your comment yeah i i think the thing is alex we
[3:49:05.260 --> 3:49:09.660]  are in those time period i think people are looking for more events more events look you take you
[3:49:09.660 --> 3:49:16.540]  take the secular press and you illustrate uh uh you know the prophetic uh uh insight foresight
[3:49:16.540 --> 3:49:21.900]  that was shown so actively in in the old and new testament but the point is that doesn't
[3:49:21.900 --> 3:49:27.420]  lessen the event and and the thing that i think people need to recognize is is that yeah i think
[3:49:27.420 --> 3:49:35.020]  this is the time period when it turns to total uh uh total garbage and the point is is that we
[3:49:35.020 --> 3:49:41.420]  we always talked about well a man will work in an entire day's wage for a quarter week you know in a
[3:49:41.420 --> 3:49:48.220]  pint of oil but the point is that now guess what the week's disappearing the oil even the uh olive
[3:49:48.220 --> 3:49:53.740]  oil crop in the Mediterranean countries that raise the majority of olive oil they're not having a
[3:49:53.740 --> 3:49:59.980]  banner year and i gotta tell you something it's the the manipulation of the weather weather is
[3:49:59.980 --> 3:50:05.420]  everything climate is everything and you know the the horrific and i'm spelling horrific
[3:50:05.420 --> 3:50:13.180]  w-h-o-r-e-i-f-i-c in other words the whole nature of the entire global warming issue when does
[3:50:13.180 --> 3:50:20.700]  anybody deal with harm when does anybody deal with exactly i want to absolute key here we know
[3:50:20.700 --> 3:50:26.780]  that global warming is a fraud well i'll tell you we're gonna go to break here but uh on the

[3:55:11.020 --> 3:55:16.140]  trillionaire is going to release a bio weapon to kill all humans he takes master race people

[3:55:21.260 --> 3:55:25.660]  when you read their actual documents there's thousands of them everything they do is for this
[3:55:25.660 --> 3:55:31.020]  and their god they believe is enlightening them to make them gods but first we have to be killed

[3:56:06.540 --> 3:56:11.980]  transmission you've got the floor of any other key points you want to make well yeah i think the
[3:56:11.980 --> 3:56:17.580]  thing is is that we used to be able to look at all these events and put them into a reference
[3:56:17.580 --> 3:56:22.780]  that we could kind of compartmentalize in our mind now everything's coming at us so fast so furious
[3:56:22.780 --> 3:56:27.420]  alex that it's like your four-hour show you need that amount because the stuff is happening and
[3:56:27.420 --> 3:56:33.500]  it's going to get worse it's going to speed up and as it speeds up the ramification or the time
[3:56:33.500 --> 3:56:38.060]  for anyone who's listening to broadcast to deal with the ramifications when they go to the store
[3:56:38.060 --> 3:56:43.180]  listen i went on record five years ago and i said i really believe in prayer and i got this is a
[3:56:43.180 --> 3:56:48.380]  matter of record on my radio broadcast the time will come when no planes will fly no trains will
[3:56:48.380 --> 3:56:55.020]  run no cars will run that america will literally be brought to a standstill and we're going to have
[3:56:55.020 --> 3:56:59.980]  and that was because you saw them making movements to do that no i think it's about by cannelly it's
[3:56:59.980 --> 3:57:06.140]  because i was really praying i was a stuff like trouble being and i really was praying and and
[3:57:06.780 --> 3:57:11.100]  when i said crying out to god saying lord show me what's going to happen so i can warn your people
[3:57:11.100 --> 3:57:17.180]  you see as a watchman you're one of those two you see the stuff that's coming a far off you don't
[3:57:17.180 --> 3:57:22.860]  you're not responsible anymore than i'm responsible for how people responder or don't respond we're
[3:57:22.860 --> 3:57:28.060]  warning them alex come on you've done so many videos so many broadcasts and and the thing is
[3:57:28.780 --> 3:57:33.980]  i see those people that listen in and kind of scoff or mock what more evidence will you need
[3:57:33.980 --> 3:57:38.860]  will it be the evidence well that's the thing everything we've said has happened so far and
[3:57:38.860 --> 3:57:43.260]  they laugh and go where's the martial law when we have curfews and police in black uniforms and
[3:57:43.260 --> 3:57:48.380]  machine guns and face scanning cameras and they're building fema camps and it's in the mainstream news
