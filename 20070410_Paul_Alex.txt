[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]  Cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.720]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.640]  Welcome, my friends, welcome. If this broadcast is any gauge of the American people's mindset,
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.920]  the freedom movement, those of us that want constitutional government and national sovereignty
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.800]  and liberty and free market, is beginning to turn the tide. The worm is turning on a host of issues.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.880]  And really, our standard bearer, if any one person could be said to be the leader of people in the
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.040]  United States who wish to go back to constitutional government and move forward, it is Congressman Ron
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.720]  Paul, who is running for president, and he's getting a lot of support, and he's going to be
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.800]  with us for the next 59 minutes, a full hour. We're going to talk until the bottom of the hour
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.960]  about his policies, his ideas, what he would do if he was president, and how you can support him
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:16.240]  and get involved in this historical election season that's coming up with this candidate who is
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.760]  founding Father Material. And I said that a few months ago. It has been picked up. I did, I guess,
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.480]  coin that term, and it has really gotten out there with banners and websites, and I hope the
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.600]  Congressman's seen that, because he is founding Father Material. He's 100% constitutional. I
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.400]  haven't seen a candidate like this in over 100 years, and I'm somewhat of a historian. I mean,
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.880]  history's so big you can't learn it all. So joining us for the next hour is Congressman
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.040]  Ron Paul. In 30 minutes, we're going to open the phones up to your calls to talk to him.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.360]  Congressman, thank you for spending a whole hour with us. Good to be with you, Alex.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.880]  Well, I know that Congress is out for a few weeks, and you're taking care of the campaign
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.240]  and trying to visit your family, and again, you join us from, I guess, your home in Texas.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.200]  Tell us, sir, basically what the number one issue facing the United States is right now.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.400]  Probably it's a threat to individual liberty, because our government is growing endlessly
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.120]  by leaps and bounds. Nobody seems to want to put a hold on it, and every time government grows,
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.560]  it's at the expense of personal liberty. And then you can go into the many, many details of
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.120]  which is the worst issue. Is it the IRS or the Federal Reserve System or the foreign policy or
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.200]  our immigration policy? I mean, there are so many other problems. I think the debt overhang is
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.520]  horrendous. This entitlement commitment is a financial burden that's going to hit us here
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.840]  in the near future that's going to be very devastating to us, and we're not very prepared
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.520]  for it. But I think the overriding issue is the issue of individual liberty, which is
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.680]  what made America great, which is what the revolution was fought about and which the
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:03.280]  Constitution tried to desperately enshrine and preserve for us. But we're at a crisis point now
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.400]  because we have been so neglectful of protecting those liberties, and we're going to suffer the
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.320]  consequences if we don't straighten it out. Can you speak to what some of those consequences are
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.880]  going to be? Well, economically, the consequences will be that there's going to be a wholesale
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.960]  rejection of the dollar because the world has trusted the dollar ever since, especially since
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.720]  the breakdown of the Bretton Woods in 1971 when the linkage to the dollar to the gold was broken.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.680]  They still trusted the dollar as if it were gold, and therefore we can print the money,
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.000]  and we can spend the money, and the foreign countries take our money, then they loan it
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.840]  back to us. So they're getting a bum rap. We actually get a temporary good deal, but what
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.000]  it does is it encourages us not to be productive. It encourages us not to have manufacturing any
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.400]  longer. We can let others do it cheaper, cheap labor, and then we buy it with cheap money,
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.320]  and that's going to come to an end, and then when that happens, and even today the dollar
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.440]  was down sharply and the gold was up sharply, which is indicating that's the movement that
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.720]  we're in, and that means later on there's going to be a lot of changes here. Domestically,
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.160]  the interest rates are going to rise, the inflation rate, the prices of all goods and services,
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.360]  that will rise, and the economy will weaken. So we have some very serious problems ahead.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.640]  I want to continue getting your analysis, Congressman, on this obvious issue of
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.320]  prime importance, the economy, the debt, the subprime loans, all of it. When you think we're
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.800]  going to see it start unraveling on the other side, then we'll go through the gamut of issues
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:57.200]  and talk about your campaign. Stay with us. It's here after a year in production and
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.000]  traveling to distant lands, mighty film Terror Storm is complete. Shocking declassified
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.760]  government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.960]  against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them. Terror Storm proves that not only
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.720]  was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.760]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:28.480]  fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.400]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.120]  It's an anthology of government crimes. Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:43.680]  truly informed must see. Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling

[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.480]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.600]  market. These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.120]  upgrade most other gravity filtration systems. They can purify raw, untreated water by removing
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.400]  pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine,
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.320]  atrazine, styrene, and MTBE. These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead,
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:24.080]  mercury, and aluminum. Unbelievably, they even remove small microparticulate from water like food
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.320]  coloring particles. Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.880]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, Black Berkey elements are more economical than the
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.240]  standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.080]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo soap or detergent? How about chlorides,
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:02.240]  dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more? Even fragrance can indicate the presence
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.760]  of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic. Hi, this is Alex Jones. I was

[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:12.400]  so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:26.240]  Jones. He really is founding father material. I know this interview will have its own life on the
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.760]  internet, so for new listeners, you can visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and read his
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:39.680]  bio. We have banners up there that link over to his presidential run website. It's RonPaul2008.com.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.480]  And Congressman, it's probably best to really start the interview officially for this full hour
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.920]  we've got with you with Ron Paul in his own words, who you are, what your awakening was like,
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.600]  what formed your ideals, and why you're running for the president.
[00:08:57.808 --> 00:08:59.808]  You
[00:09:27.808 --> 00:09:29.808]  You
[00:09:57.808 --> 00:09:59.808]  You
[00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:01.808]  You
[00:10:01.808 --> 00:10:03.808]  You
[00:10:03.808 --> 00:10:05.808]  You
[00:10:05.808 --> 00:10:07.808]  You
[00:10:07.808 --> 00:10:09.808]  You
[00:10:09.808 --> 00:10:11.808]  You
[00:10:11.808 --> 00:10:13.808]  You
[00:10:13.808 --> 00:10:15.808]  You
[00:10:15.808 --> 00:10:17.808]  You
[00:10:17.808 --> 00:10:19.808]  You
[00:10:19.808 --> 00:10:21.808]  You
[00:10:21.808 --> 00:10:23.808]  You
[00:10:23.808 --> 00:10:25.808]  You
[00:10:25.808 --> 00:10:30.808]  Always to become a physician, which I was able to achieve, I went to Duke Medical School.
[00:10:30.808 --> 00:10:36.808]  But as I was finishing medical school and getting into my training, I became fascinated with also reading about economic policy.
[00:10:36.808 --> 00:10:42.808]  I came across Hayek's book, A Road to Serfdom, and he represented the Austrian School of Economics.
[00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:48.808]  And that fascinated me because I believe they were on the most to run probably with the economic issues,
[00:10:48.808 --> 00:10:54.808]  the fascination with how the monetary policy in the Federal Reserve was so damaging to our economy.
[00:10:54.808 --> 00:11:04.808]  And yet, over the years, that interest in economic policy also transferred an interest into foreign policy,
[00:11:04.808 --> 00:11:13.808]  because I saw the connection that our efforts to police the world and spend money and maintain an empire was dangerous,
[00:11:13.808 --> 00:11:19.808]  hurt our national security, was very damaging to our financial health.
[00:11:19.808 --> 00:11:28.808]  And it was connected in that if you have military spending out of control as well as domestic entitlements spending out of control,
[00:11:28.808 --> 00:11:33.808]  the only way you can maintain it is through a central bank that creates money out of thin air.
[00:11:33.808 --> 00:11:35.808]  And they all came together.
[00:11:35.808 --> 00:11:39.808]  So I worked very hard on foreign policy as well as monetary and economic policy,
[00:11:39.808 --> 00:11:43.808]  and served on the banking committee, which is the financial services committee,
[00:11:43.808 --> 00:11:48.808]  as well as the joint economic committee, and also foreign affairs.
[00:11:49.808 --> 00:11:56.808]  If you were elected president, what would be the first actions that you would take?
[00:11:56.808 --> 00:12:00.808]  You know, there are so many things that can and should be done.
[00:12:00.808 --> 00:12:07.808]  There's a limit to what you can do without, you know, trying to follow best you can the rules,
[00:12:07.808 --> 00:12:09.808]  and that is getting Congress to go along.
[00:12:09.808 --> 00:12:11.808]  But there's still a lot you could do.
[00:12:11.808 --> 00:12:15.808]  As a commander-in-chief, you certainly could handle the troops around the world.
[00:12:15.808 --> 00:12:23.808]  I would start talking to all our allies, tell them what the plans were, and start coming home.
[00:12:23.808 --> 00:12:29.808]  And we are now spending close to a trillion dollars maintaining our foreign policy.
[00:12:29.808 --> 00:12:34.808]  And it's a lot bigger than most people realize, but if you add up the DOD, the supplementals,
[00:12:34.808 --> 00:12:40.808]  the interest on the money we spend in taking care of our veterans, and by the way, sometimes very poorly.
[00:12:40.808 --> 00:12:44.808]  It's also a foreign policy that has taken us from the most loved to the most hated.
[00:12:44.808 --> 00:12:45.808]  That is true.
[00:12:45.808 --> 00:12:50.808]  You know, they accuse us, who believe in the Constitution and minding our own business,
[00:12:50.808 --> 00:12:53.808]  yet trading with people they call us isolationists.
[00:12:53.808 --> 00:12:55.808]  And yet, what have they done to us?
[00:12:55.808 --> 00:13:00.808]  They have made us turn our country into isolationists.
[00:13:00.808 --> 00:13:02.808]  Diplomatically, we don't talk to anybody.
[00:13:02.808 --> 00:13:05.808]  We have more enemies than we've ever had before, and fewer allies.
[00:13:05.808 --> 00:13:11.808]  And at the same time, our ability to defend this country is being diminished on a daily basis.
[00:13:11.808 --> 00:13:14.808]  And we worry about borders all around the world.
[00:13:14.808 --> 00:13:16.808]  We worry about borders in Korea.
[00:13:16.808 --> 00:13:19.808]  We worry about borders around Iraq.
[00:13:19.808 --> 00:13:21.808]  And what do we do with our own borders?
[00:13:21.808 --> 00:13:27.808]  They built a fence over two-thirds of Afghanistan that cost, what was it, four billion dollars or something.
[00:13:27.808 --> 00:13:29.808]  And here, we don't do anything.
[00:13:29.808 --> 00:13:32.808]  We have behind the scenes the plans for a North American Union.
[00:13:32.808 --> 00:13:37.808]  And you know, that's the part that the American people are starting to wake up to.
[00:13:37.808 --> 00:13:41.808]  Although, we have a long way to go to wake up Washington.
[00:13:41.808 --> 00:13:48.808]  It's amazing to me how many people outside of Washington are very much aware of some of these plans with this North American Union.
[00:13:48.808 --> 00:13:51.808]  At the same time, they're in total denial in Washington,
[00:13:51.808 --> 00:13:57.808]  except for the few who, behind the scenes, are laying the plans and providing the finances.
[00:13:57.808 --> 00:14:02.808]  Congressman, I've got a whole gamut of questions I want to walk through with you.
[00:14:02.808 --> 00:14:04.808]  And we're honored you're spending a full hour with us today.
[00:14:04.808 --> 00:14:06.808]  Calls are coming up in 15 minutes, folks.
[00:14:06.808 --> 00:14:11.808]  But let's just right now, because I'm getting calls every day, emails every hour, calls.
[00:14:11.808 --> 00:14:15.808]  I mean, it's wild the amount of support you've got because we're being inundated.
[00:14:15.808 --> 00:14:20.808]  How do we help the congressman? How do we help the congressman? How do we help the congressman?
[00:14:20.808 --> 00:14:23.808]  So without giving away too much, what is your strategy?
[00:14:23.808 --> 00:14:26.808]  How do people in the 50 states support you?
[00:14:26.808 --> 00:14:28.808]  Number one, I mean, monetary right now, folks.
[00:14:28.808 --> 00:14:31.808]  I'm going to write a check today and mail it to the congressman.
[00:14:31.808 --> 00:14:33.808]  You can also donate there on the website.
[00:14:33.808 --> 00:14:37.808]  I mean, obviously you haven't raised $23 million like Hillary,
[00:14:37.808 --> 00:14:40.808]  but you've raised, as you told me off there, $600,000 plus.
[00:14:40.808 --> 00:14:42.808]  How do people support you?
[00:14:42.808 --> 00:14:45.808]  I mean, I guess, number one, they've got to believe you can win.
[00:14:45.808 --> 00:14:46.808]  They've got to know you can win.
[00:14:46.808 --> 00:14:52.808]  And on top of that, regardless, you're going to interject some real sanity into the presidential debate.
[00:14:52.808 --> 00:14:55.808]  Well, let's hope so.
[00:14:55.808 --> 00:14:58.808]  And the competition isn't all that great, so I hope we do well.
[00:14:58.808 --> 00:15:00.808]  And that will be coming up pretty soon.
[00:15:00.808 --> 00:15:07.808]  The first debate will be at the beginning of May in California, and I will be in that.
[00:15:07.808 --> 00:15:13.808]  But the most important thing, especially for us, is to raise the money so that we can hire the staff.
[00:15:13.808 --> 00:15:18.808]  But we also have a strategy that we have to be proportionate to what we have.
[00:15:18.808 --> 00:15:22.808]  So we can't plan for television in California at this moment.
[00:15:22.808 --> 00:15:24.808]  I mean, that wouldn't be a wise decision.
[00:15:24.808 --> 00:15:27.808]  But we can work very hard in New Hampshire, very hard in Iowa.
[00:15:27.808 --> 00:15:30.808]  I will be leaving within an hour or so after we finish this program.
[00:15:30.808 --> 00:15:33.808]  I'll be leaving for Iowa, and I'll spend three days there.
[00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:38.808]  And that's my first trip there, and we'll probably get a pretty good feel for how things are going
[00:15:38.808 --> 00:15:42.808]  and how the grassroots are responding in that state.
[00:15:42.808 --> 00:15:44.808]  But then another early state is Nevada.
[00:15:44.808 --> 00:15:45.808]  That's a good state for us.
[00:15:45.808 --> 00:15:49.808]  I've been to Arizona, and the reception there was exceptionally good.
[00:15:49.808 --> 00:15:56.808]  So the strategy will be to go into these five or six early primaries, the states that it's easier to reach,
[00:15:56.808 --> 00:16:03.808]  and raising the money in order to have the staff in order to do the organization that we need.
[00:16:03.808 --> 00:16:06.808]  Obviously, money is essential.
[00:16:06.808 --> 00:16:07.808]  You've got the policies.
[00:16:07.808 --> 00:16:08.808]  You've got the brain.
[00:16:08.808 --> 00:16:09.808]  You've got the crew.
[00:16:09.808 --> 00:16:10.808]  You need money.
[00:16:10.808 --> 00:16:15.808]  Specifically, Congressman, how do people support financially your presidential run?
[00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:21.808]  Well, the best way is to get hold of our website, Ron Paul 2008.
[00:16:21.808 --> 00:16:24.808]  And you can donate over the website.
[00:16:24.808 --> 00:16:33.808]  People who are not anxious to use the website and their credit cards over the Internet, they should call 800-RON-PAUL.
[00:16:33.808 --> 00:16:39.808]  That's an 800 number we have, and you can get details about the address to send the check
[00:16:39.808 --> 00:16:43.808]  and find out more about the campaign that way.
[00:16:43.808 --> 00:16:45.808]  That's 1-800-RON-PAUL.
[00:16:45.808 --> 00:16:50.808]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to give $1,000 today to the campaign.
[00:16:50.808 --> 00:16:52.808]  Now, these laws get so confusing.
[00:16:52.808 --> 00:16:54.808]  Can I give that much, Congressman, as an individual?
[00:16:54.808 --> 00:16:55.808]  Yes.
[00:16:55.808 --> 00:17:01.808]  As a matter of fact, I think it's now $2,300 per person per campaign.
[00:17:01.808 --> 00:17:05.808]  Well, right now, and I'm not a wealthy person, I'm going to give $1,000.
[00:17:05.808 --> 00:17:08.808]  And the reason I'm doing this is I don't want to hear this talk of,
[00:17:08.808 --> 00:17:11.808]  he can't win, they're too big, the election machines, it's a fraud.
[00:17:11.808 --> 00:17:15.808]  Regardless, we've got a chance here with somebody who's got a perfect voting record,
[00:17:15.808 --> 00:17:19.808]  who has tried to abolish the Federal Reserve, who stands up to the Fed Chairman
[00:17:19.808 --> 00:17:20.808]  when he comes into the banking committee.
[00:17:20.808 --> 00:17:22.808]  We're going to play a clip later in the hour.
[00:17:22.808 --> 00:17:24.808]  We've got somebody who will bring the troops home,
[00:17:24.808 --> 00:17:29.808]  not like these fake Democrats who put on smoke-and-mirror, dog-and-pony, carnival-barking shows.
[00:17:29.808 --> 00:17:35.808]  We've got somebody who is dead on on every single issue and who is popular in every single group,
[00:17:35.808 --> 00:17:39.808]  the liberals, the conservatives, the libertarians, the constitutionalists.
[00:17:39.808 --> 00:17:41.808]  We've got to get behind Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:17:41.808 --> 00:17:44.808]  This country is in dire straits.
[00:17:44.808 --> 00:17:46.808]  The economy is unraveling.
[00:17:46.808 --> 00:17:50.808]  There are so many problems, and we cannot have a Hillary Clinton or a Mitt Romney
[00:17:50.808 --> 00:17:54.808]  or one of these establishment wonks in there.
[00:17:54.808 --> 00:17:56.808]  And bottom line, he needs to have a strong showing.
[00:17:56.808 --> 00:17:59.808]  He's going to be in some of the debates that's already been scheduled.
[00:17:59.808 --> 00:18:00.808]  That's exciting.
[00:18:00.808 --> 00:18:05.808]  He's a lot better than people who have some questioning, some history,
[00:18:05.808 --> 00:18:10.808]  like Ross Perot with government contracts and spook behavior.
[00:18:10.808 --> 00:18:12.808]  I'm not going to attack him. I supported him at the time.
[00:18:12.808 --> 00:18:15.808]  It's just that Congressman Ron Paul doesn't have those skeletons.
[00:18:15.808 --> 00:18:17.808]  I know him well. I've looked at him carefully.
[00:18:17.808 --> 00:18:19.808]  And I'm telling you, get behind him.
[00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:24.808]  It can become a phenomenon, like we saw with Ross Perot, and he can win, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:24.808 --> 00:18:26.808]  Now, this is a chance to be part of history.
[00:18:26.808 --> 00:18:28.808]  You go to Ron Paul's website.
[00:18:28.808 --> 00:18:35.808]  You go to ronpaul2008.com and you donate, or you call 1-800-RON-PAUL and you donate right now.
[00:18:35.808 --> 00:18:37.808]  1-800-RON-PAUL.
[00:18:37.808 --> 00:18:40.808]  It's time to stop the talk. It's time to take action.
[00:18:40.808 --> 00:18:42.808]  Now, there are other strategies.
[00:18:42.808 --> 00:18:45.808]  Wherever the Congressman's going, you watch his website, where he's going to be.
[00:18:45.808 --> 00:18:47.808]  And if you live in that area, you come out and support him.
[00:18:47.808 --> 00:18:49.808]  You call the newspapers. You call the TV.
[00:18:49.808 --> 00:18:52.808]  Fox News had him on and said, man, you've got a lot of supporters.
[00:18:52.808 --> 00:18:56.808]  You have already been knocking down the doors at Fox, CNN, Bill Maher,
[00:18:56.808 --> 00:18:59.808]  to keep the buzz going, to demand they stop ignoring him.
[00:18:59.808 --> 00:19:05.808]  Every time the Congressman wins a poll, they then pull him out and say, oh, his people are cheating.
[00:19:05.808 --> 00:19:10.808]  You know, there's no way he can be winning by 65%, 70% in a five-way poll.
[00:19:10.808 --> 00:19:12.808]  No, that is the will of the people.
[00:19:12.808 --> 00:19:17.808]  I'm here to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, people are anti-New World Order, they're pro-Constitution,
[00:19:17.808 --> 00:19:21.808]  and Ron Paul needs to be the next President of the United States.
[00:19:21.808 --> 00:19:30.808]  So right now, I want you to go to ronpaul2008.com, ronpaul2008.com, or 1-800-RON-PAUL,
[00:19:30.808 --> 00:19:33.808]  and I want you to donate, and I want you to be extremely generous,
[00:19:33.808 --> 00:19:37.808]  because this country and our children and our grandchildren depend on it.
[00:19:37.808 --> 00:19:41.808]  Listen, in a few years, we may have to start evacuating the country, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:19:41.808 --> 00:19:45.808]  and there's nowhere to run. If we don't turn this around now, this is a real avenue.
[00:19:49.808 --> 00:19:52.808]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water,
[00:19:52.808 --> 00:19:55.808]  and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals
[00:19:55.808 --> 00:19:57.808]  by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:19:57.808 --> 00:20:00.808]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate,
[00:20:00.808 --> 00:20:02.808]  and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:20:02.808 --> 00:20:07.808]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron,
[00:20:07.808 --> 00:20:11.808]  and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:20:11.808 --> 00:20:15.808]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:20:15.808 --> 00:20:20.808]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:20:20.808 --> 00:20:24.808]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media
[00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:27.808]  to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:20:27.808 --> 00:20:29.808]  What about you?
[00:20:29.808 --> 00:20:37.808]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:20:53.808 --> 00:20:57.808]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.

[00:21:50.808 --> 00:21:52.808]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:21:52.808 --> 00:21:58.808]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer
[00:21:58.808 --> 00:22:01.808]  and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:01.808 --> 00:22:09.808]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:09.808 --> 00:22:15.808]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMed Inc.'s patented methodology.
[00:22:15.808 --> 00:22:19.808]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation,
[00:22:19.808 --> 00:22:27.808]  we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:22:27.808 --> 00:22:30.808]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:22:30.808 --> 00:22:36.808]  For more information, call 702-953-0267

[00:22:44.808 --> 00:22:48.808]  Call 702-953-0267
[00:22:49.808 --> 00:22:56.808]  Thus says Yahweh, if you will not keep my commandments by violating my covenant, I will bring upon you sudden terror.
[00:22:59.808 --> 00:23:03.808]  Just as prophesized, the judgments upon America have begun.
[00:23:03.808 --> 00:23:07.808]  Yes, the terror attacks of 9-11 opened Revelation's first seal.
[00:23:07.808 --> 00:23:12.808]  In the name of peace and safety, the writer king has mounted his white horse, waging wars and rumors of war,
[00:23:12.808 --> 00:23:15.808]  conquering the Middle East for treasures of oil.
[00:23:15.808 --> 00:23:18.808]  Get to witness ministry's next shocking revelation.
[00:23:18.808 --> 00:23:22.808]  The writer of the white horse, George W. Bush, in prophecy.
[00:23:22.808 --> 00:23:25.808]  Visit the website www.TwoWitnessMinistries.com
[00:23:25.808 --> 00:23:30.808]  King George II beats the war drums for his next invasion, Iran and Syria.
[00:23:30.808 --> 00:23:33.808]  More nations are to follow, including the draft of your children.
[00:23:33.808 --> 00:23:37.808]  With a $25 love offering to Two Witness Ministries, get the book,
[00:23:37.808 --> 00:23:43.808]  The Writer of the White Horse, at box 2453, Aveline, Texas, 79604.
[00:23:43.808 --> 00:23:48.808]  Unless she repents, America will not survive the red horse of World War III.
[00:23:58.808 --> 00:24:03.808]  I've been watching politics since I was a little bitty kid,
[00:24:03.808 --> 00:24:10.808]  checking out the stuff going on with Watergate.
[00:24:11.808 --> 00:24:16.808]  I've been doing talk radio for quite a while and covering this, so I know a little bit about politics.
[00:24:16.808 --> 00:24:19.808]  I've talked to a lot of experts and strategists and people in both parties.
[00:24:19.808 --> 00:24:21.808]  Believe me, they're scared of Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:24:21.808 --> 00:24:26.808]  He's got a real chance to win because you don't have election fraud machines in place everywhere.
[00:24:26.808 --> 00:24:28.808]  You've got massive grassroots support.
[00:24:28.808 --> 00:24:32.808]  People want a change. They want a true populist with constitutional principles.
[00:24:32.808 --> 00:24:35.808]  Congressman, you wanted to add one more point about the campaign,
[00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:37.808]  and then we would get into the questions.
[00:24:37.808 --> 00:24:40.808]  I do emphasize the need for money, and that certainly is the case.
[00:24:40.808 --> 00:24:45.808]  But there are other things that can help a candidate like myself, and that is the Internet.
[00:24:45.808 --> 00:24:50.808]  The Internet already has been very helpful, and I think it's going to be more helpful as time goes on.
[00:24:50.808 --> 00:24:53.808]  That's something that is becoming more so every day.
[00:24:53.808 --> 00:24:57.808]  Ten, fifteen years ago, it wasn't even significant.
[00:24:57.808 --> 00:25:03.808]  The other thing is that radio talk shows like what you have, they're very important.
[00:25:03.808 --> 00:25:06.808]  Almost every place I go, somebody will come up to me and ask,
[00:25:06.808 --> 00:25:09.808]  well, how did you get involved in this? And it's through your show.
[00:25:09.808 --> 00:25:11.808]  So there's a lot of people who have joined our campaign
[00:25:11.808 --> 00:25:16.808]  and who have already started to show up at our events because of your encouragement.
[00:25:16.808 --> 00:25:22.808]  The other point is they will not match those individuals who are bought and paid for
[00:25:22.808 --> 00:25:28.808]  by the special interest where they can raise $100 million because they want access for their contracts.
[00:25:28.808 --> 00:25:30.808]  They waste a lot of that money.
[00:25:30.808 --> 00:25:34.808]  They have their private jets, and they pay huge salaries,
[00:25:34.808 --> 00:25:37.808]  and they spend a lot of money on advertisement,
[00:25:37.808 --> 00:25:46.808]  and it really is not as important today to run a campaign that way as it used to be in the past.
[00:25:46.808 --> 00:25:50.808]  So there's a lot of other reasons for us to be hopeful that this thing will take off
[00:25:50.808 --> 00:25:54.808]  and that we'll do much, much better than anybody ever dreamed we would.
[00:25:54.808 --> 00:25:55.808]  Well, I'm already saying that.
[00:25:55.808 --> 00:26:00.808]  In fact, when you decided to run, you said you were testing the waters in your exploratory committee,
[00:26:00.808 --> 00:26:05.808]  and then you said, if memory serves, that it was a bigger response than you were even hoping for.
[00:26:05.808 --> 00:26:08.808]  Yeah, it wasn't a surprise to me.
[00:26:08.808 --> 00:26:14.808]  I'm usually the skeptical one because I don't want to overstate a position
[00:26:14.808 --> 00:26:19.808]  and then not only disappoint my supporters, but also I don't want to fool myself either.
[00:26:19.808 --> 00:26:27.808]  So I'm rather conservative in my estimates, but each day we go on, I'm feeling better about it.
[00:26:27.808 --> 00:26:30.808]  Well, I mean, you know this better than I.
[00:26:30.808 --> 00:26:34.808]  You've lived longer, and you've seen a lot more than I have, but I've learned this in life.
[00:26:34.808 --> 00:26:36.808]  If you don't get in the game, you have no chance of winning.
[00:26:36.808 --> 00:26:39.808]  And you're in the game, you're suited up, and you've got the tools,
[00:26:39.808 --> 00:26:42.808]  and you're the man for the job, and so we've got to support you.
[00:26:42.808 --> 00:26:43.808]  That's right.
[00:26:43.808 --> 00:26:45.808]  Some people say, well, why do this?
[00:26:45.808 --> 00:26:47.808]  And they'll point out all the negatives.
[00:26:47.808 --> 00:26:48.808]  But you're right.
[00:26:48.808 --> 00:26:53.808]  If you don't do it, you know absolutely what the outcome is going to be.
[00:26:53.808 --> 00:26:56.808]  And you make the point that time is running out,
[00:26:56.808 --> 00:27:00.808]  and I talk about the financial situation that that's running out.
[00:27:00.808 --> 00:27:05.808]  And we may lose our liberties to the point where we won't have these responses.
[00:27:05.808 --> 00:27:09.808]  There's nothing that guarantees that they'll allow you to have your radio show forever.
[00:27:09.808 --> 00:27:14.808]  They have already trampled on our rights.
[00:27:14.808 --> 00:27:19.808]  They talk about putting people in prison today without habeas corpus.
[00:27:19.808 --> 00:27:25.808]  Congressman, I've had probably four or five national TV hosts and radio hosts call for my imprisonment,
[00:27:25.808 --> 00:27:28.808]  call us all traitors if we question the war.
[00:27:28.808 --> 00:27:30.808]  I mean, this is getting scary.
[00:27:30.808 --> 00:27:32.808]  No, that is true.
[00:27:32.808 --> 00:27:37.808]  And if we don't preserve our fundamental freedoms, we can't fight back.
[00:27:37.808 --> 00:27:42.808]  People say, well, you know, what you're saying is the country is like it's bankrupt.
[00:27:42.808 --> 00:27:44.808]  I mean, you know, in many ways that's the case.
[00:27:44.808 --> 00:27:46.808]  But I'm convinced of one thing.
[00:27:46.808 --> 00:27:50.808]  You know, we could all be poor tomorrow, very, very poor and start from scratch.
[00:27:50.808 --> 00:27:53.808]  But if we have our freedoms and we have our sound currency
[00:27:53.808 --> 00:27:58.808]  and we have the government off our back, this country would rebound so quickly
[00:27:58.808 --> 00:28:00.808]  and we would regain the jobs.
[00:28:00.808 --> 00:28:02.808]  You know, we would have our manufacturing base back.
[00:28:02.808 --> 00:28:04.808]  All these things would happen.
[00:28:04.808 --> 00:28:07.808]  I am absolutely positive on how freedom works.
[00:28:07.808 --> 00:28:10.808]  In fact, I don't worry about us getting poor,
[00:28:10.808 --> 00:28:13.808]  even if it's just temporary, because I believe we would be very productive once again.
[00:28:13.808 --> 00:28:16.808]  Congressman Ron Paul, that is one of the questions I had for you,
[00:28:16.808 --> 00:28:22.808]  because, I mean, I make the observation that the Federal Reserve debt that we have,
[00:28:22.808 --> 00:28:26.808]  most of it is based in fraud, and you and others have a plan to basically discharge that
[00:28:26.808 --> 00:28:30.808]  during the depression that they would engineer to further consolidate control,
[00:28:30.808 --> 00:28:35.808]  as they've done in 1933 and in other cases globally with the IMF and World Bank documents
[00:28:35.808 --> 00:28:39.808]  that came out via Joseph Stiklitz, their chief economist, a few years ago.
[00:28:39.808 --> 00:28:43.808]  And so if the people are aware of who is behind this financial implosion,
[00:28:43.808 --> 00:28:46.808]  this may be what catapults the constitutionalists, you know,
[00:28:46.808 --> 00:28:49.808]  back into control of the nation to turn loose the people.
[00:28:49.808 --> 00:28:52.808]  And so it's one thing for them to claim ownership of us.
[00:28:52.808 --> 00:28:55.808]  It's another thing for them to actually execute that ownership.
[00:28:55.808 --> 00:29:00.808]  Right, and the laws of economics are much more powerful than the laws of government.
[00:29:00.808 --> 00:29:03.808]  I know how powerful the Fed is and the government is and the IRS is,
[00:29:03.808 --> 00:29:06.808]  but ultimately the laws of economics prevail.
[00:29:06.808 --> 00:29:11.808]  No matter what they do, you recall in the old days they said,
[00:29:11.808 --> 00:29:17.808]  we will keep the dollar strong, this dollar is worth $35 to an ounce and we'll do that,
[00:29:17.808 --> 00:29:21.808]  and yet eventually the laws of economics broke that down, it broke loose,
[00:29:21.808 --> 00:29:25.808]  and we had that high, horrendous inflation and recession of the 1970s.
[00:29:25.808 --> 00:29:26.808]  The same thing is happening now.
[00:29:26.808 --> 00:29:29.808]  We're moving into recession at the same time the inflation is coming back,
[00:29:29.808 --> 00:29:31.808]  and yet they don't do anything in Washington.
[00:29:31.808 --> 00:29:33.808]  They keep spending and keep printing.
[00:29:33.808 --> 00:29:37.808]  Let's expand on that on the other side and take your calls with Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:29:39.808 --> 00:29:43.808]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:43.808 --> 00:29:46.808]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:49.808 --> 00:29:52.808]  Automakers in the oil industry are in a fuel fight.
[00:29:52.808 --> 00:29:56.808]  Automakers claim gasoline quality doesn't measure up.
[00:29:56.808 --> 00:29:58.808]  Is your vehicle performing like it should?
[00:29:58.808 --> 00:30:03.808]  Now there's SFR Green, performance technologies for a clean planet.

[00:30:07.808 --> 00:30:09.808]  meeting automakers' new standards.
[00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:11.808]  So do something green.

[00:30:23.808 --> 00:30:25.808]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:30:25.808 --> 00:30:29.808]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:30:29.808 --> 00:30:34.808]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt,
[00:30:34.808 --> 00:30:36.808]  and it maintains its purchasing power.

[00:30:49.808 --> 00:30:53.808]  Craig Walcott, Chartered Financial Consultant and host of the Dead Doctors Don't Lie Radio Program,

[00:31:04.808 --> 00:31:07.808]  The sad truth is that 99% of the people who enter network marketing

[00:31:48.808 --> 00:31:51.808]  Right now 65% of Americans are overweight.
[00:31:51.808 --> 00:31:55.808]  Experts say by the year 2010 that number will increase to 75%
[00:31:55.808 --> 00:31:57.808]  and 35% will be obese.
[00:31:57.808 --> 00:32:00.808]  Because of these deadly statistics, Dr. Joel Wallach,

[00:33:15.808 --> 00:33:22.808]  You know, we've got a five-minute clip,
[00:33:22.808 --> 00:33:25.808]  and we're not going to play very much of it, but about two minutes into it,
[00:33:25.808 --> 00:33:28.808]  this is a few weeks ago, and then he did it a few months before that,
[00:33:28.808 --> 00:33:32.808]  Congressman Ron Paul confronting the new Fed Chairman
[00:33:32.808 --> 00:33:38.808]  on the fact that the Federal Reserve is completely non-transparent and secretive.
[00:33:38.808 --> 00:33:41.808]  In fact, John, I forgot to ask you, do you have that queued up to about two minutes in?
[00:33:41.808 --> 00:33:43.808]  Let's go ahead and roll about 30 seconds of that,
[00:33:43.808 --> 00:33:46.808]  and then we'll go back to the Congressman and get his response to it.
[00:33:46.808 --> 00:33:49.808]  With other central banks, we get less and less information
[00:33:49.808 --> 00:33:51.808]  regarding the money supply each year,
[00:33:51.808 --> 00:33:56.808]  especially now that we don't even have access to M3 statistics.
[00:33:56.808 --> 00:34:00.808]  The role the Fed plays in the President's secretive working group
[00:34:00.808 --> 00:34:04.808]  on financial markets goes essentially unnoticed by Congress.
[00:34:04.808 --> 00:34:08.808]  The Federal Reserve shows no willingness to inform Congress voluntarily
[00:34:08.808 --> 00:34:12.808]  about how often the working group meets, what action it takes.
[00:34:12.808 --> 00:34:16.808]  That affects the financial markets or why it takes these actions.
[00:34:16.808 --> 00:34:19.808]  But all these actions directed by the Federal Reserve
[00:34:19.808 --> 00:34:22.808]  alter the purchasing power of our money,
[00:34:22.808 --> 00:34:25.808]  and that purchasing power is always reduced.
[00:34:25.808 --> 00:34:29.808]  The dollar today is worth only four cents compared to the dollar
[00:34:29.808 --> 00:34:32.808]  that the Federal Reserve started with in 1913.
[00:34:32.808 --> 00:34:38.808]  This has significant consequences on our economy and our political stability.
[00:34:38.808 --> 00:34:41.808]  All paper currencies are vulnerable to collapse,
[00:34:41.808 --> 00:34:46.808]  and history is replete with examples of great suffering caused by these collapses,
[00:34:46.808 --> 00:34:49.808]  especially to the nation's poor and the middle class.
[00:34:49.808 --> 00:34:52.808]  Now, rather than continuing the whole clip,
[00:34:52.808 --> 00:34:55.808]  Congressman, can you give us your take on Bernanke's response?
[00:34:55.808 --> 00:34:58.808]  You talk about four cents.
[00:34:58.808 --> 00:35:00.808]  That number that I've got is from a couple years ago
[00:35:00.808 --> 00:35:03.808]  before they really made the money supply secretive,
[00:35:03.808 --> 00:35:06.808]  and a lot of the experts I've talked to say it could be devalued
[00:35:06.808 --> 00:35:08.808]  down to a cent and a half right now,
[00:35:08.808 --> 00:35:10.808]  or I guess there's really no way of knowing?
[00:35:10.808 --> 00:35:13.808]  No, it's hard, and there'll be different statistics.
[00:35:13.808 --> 00:35:17.808]  We know that it's steady, and it's always going down.
[00:35:17.808 --> 00:35:22.808]  There's a private source now trying to reproduce M3,
[00:35:22.808 --> 00:35:25.808]  and they claim that it's growing between 11 and 12 percent.
[00:35:25.808 --> 00:35:28.808]  That's a horrendous amount of monetary inflation.
[00:35:28.808 --> 00:35:31.808]  As a matter of fact, since that clip,
[00:35:31.808 --> 00:35:34.808]  Bernanke was before the Joint Economic Committee,
[00:35:34.808 --> 00:35:38.808]  and I didn't have as much time, but I presented the same questions,
[00:35:38.808 --> 00:35:41.808]  especially about the working group on financial markets,
[00:35:41.808 --> 00:35:44.808]  which I think is a very, very sinister group.
[00:35:44.808 --> 00:35:48.808]  I think they have more control over trying to bail the big guys out
[00:35:48.808 --> 00:35:50.808]  when there's a stock market collapse
[00:35:50.808 --> 00:35:53.808]  and then the little people get held holding the bag.
[00:35:53.808 --> 00:35:55.808]  But when I ask him, you know, again,
[00:35:55.808 --> 00:35:57.808]  how often do you meet and do you hold minutes,
[00:35:57.808 --> 00:36:00.808]  and he says it was so blunt.
[00:36:00.808 --> 00:36:04.808]  He says, I don't know, and it was no expression,
[00:36:04.808 --> 00:36:07.808]  nothing like don't bother me, don't bug me with this.
[00:36:07.808 --> 00:36:09.808]  I don't know.
[00:36:09.808 --> 00:36:12.808]  And we've got that clip, but in the interest of time, we won't play it.
[00:36:12.808 --> 00:36:14.808]  But later, folks, after the Congressman leaves us in the third hour,
[00:36:14.808 --> 00:36:16.808]  we'll dig it up and play it.
[00:36:16.808 --> 00:36:18.808]  But, I mean, think about this. This is Congress.
[00:36:18.808 --> 00:36:20.808]  This is the Banking Committee.
[00:36:20.808 --> 00:36:22.808]  These are our elected representatives of the people.
[00:36:22.808 --> 00:36:24.808]  This is the government.
[00:36:24.808 --> 00:36:26.808]  And here comes this guy from a private Federal Reserve
[00:36:26.808 --> 00:36:29.808]  owned by private families that instructs our Treasury
[00:36:29.808 --> 00:36:31.808]  and colludes with the President secretly.
[00:36:31.808 --> 00:36:34.808]  I mean, again, the average American is just now beginning to realize this.
[00:36:34.808 --> 00:36:36.808]  That's right.
[00:36:36.808 --> 00:36:40.808]  And I wish I could wake up the Congress to realize how significant this is.
[00:36:40.808 --> 00:36:44.808]  And, you know, the liberals are always concerned about the poor people
[00:36:44.808 --> 00:36:46.808]  and, you know, and how they're coming up short.
[00:36:46.808 --> 00:36:50.808]  And I agree with them on so many issues that their analysis
[00:36:50.808 --> 00:36:52.808]  of the problems we face are true.
[00:36:52.808 --> 00:36:54.808]  You know, there are poor people and they're hurt.
[00:36:54.808 --> 00:36:56.808]  Inflation hurts them.
[00:36:56.808 --> 00:36:58.808]  They lose their jobs and they lose their homes
[00:36:58.808 --> 00:37:01.808]  and all these problems we face,
[00:37:01.808 --> 00:37:03.808]  and yet they do not see the connection to the monetary problem.
[00:37:03.808 --> 00:37:08.808]  They want the Fed to print more money to accommodate their spending
[00:37:08.808 --> 00:37:11.808]  and they figure if they keep spending and maybe raise taxes on the rich,
[00:37:11.808 --> 00:37:15.808]  they're going to redistribute this wealth and overcome this difficulty.
[00:37:15.808 --> 00:37:20.808]  But the destruction of a currency always means the destruction of the middle class.
[00:37:20.808 --> 00:37:22.808]  And I think that's what we're starting to witness right now.
[00:37:22.808 --> 00:37:25.808]  Well, we know elites have always waged war on the middle class
[00:37:25.808 --> 00:37:29.808]  and we know that elites have imploded currencies before by design to consolidate.
[00:37:29.808 --> 00:37:32.808]  But from what I've been seeing, it appears that the financial oligarchs
[00:37:32.808 --> 00:37:36.808]  are actually attempting to shore things up, at least for the time being,
[00:37:36.808 --> 00:37:38.808]  and the Financial Times of London and others are saying
[00:37:38.808 --> 00:37:42.808]  that even high-level elites are worried about being bankrupted themselves
[00:37:42.808 --> 00:37:46.808]  because this bubble is so big it could actually black hole their system as well.
[00:37:46.808 --> 00:37:47.808]  What do you see happening?
[00:37:47.808 --> 00:37:51.808]  Yeah, I think that's a possibility because I think in the early
[00:37:51.808 --> 00:37:56.808]  and the slightly later stages, the elite can protect themselves.
[00:37:56.808 --> 00:37:59.808]  But think of what happened to the so-called elite in Germany
[00:37:59.808 --> 00:38:01.808]  when the runaway inflation occurred.
[00:38:01.808 --> 00:38:05.808]  I mean, eventually they had to resort to a dictatorship.
[00:38:05.808 --> 00:38:06.808]  They had to find a scapegoat.
[00:38:06.808 --> 00:38:09.808]  At that time they found the Jews were the scapegoat.
[00:38:09.808 --> 00:38:14.808]  And unless you became an SS officer, you were a victim.
[00:38:14.808 --> 00:38:19.808]  But eventually it's political chaos is what happens and too often it leads to war.
[00:38:19.808 --> 00:38:22.808]  And there's a protectionist sentiment.
[00:38:22.808 --> 00:38:25.808]  We have problems and prices go up and say,
[00:38:25.808 --> 00:38:28.808]  well, what we need to do is go protect our oil.
[00:38:28.808 --> 00:38:31.808]  And they don't realize that it costs a lot of money to protect the oil.
[00:38:31.808 --> 00:38:33.808]  Then when we go over, we disturb markets.
[00:38:33.808 --> 00:38:37.808]  And instead of the price of oil being protected, the price of oil triples.
[00:38:37.808 --> 00:38:39.808]  Well, Congressman, you just hit on it though.
[00:38:39.808 --> 00:38:43.808]  That's the pre-positioning we see of ready to go into Iran,
[00:38:43.808 --> 00:38:48.808]  ready to go into Syria, FEMA camps built, open discussion.
[00:38:48.808 --> 00:38:51.808]  We now learn Tommy Franks was on secret Pentagon payroll
[00:38:51.808 --> 00:38:54.808]  when he, quote, was an independent citizen giving speeches saying,
[00:38:54.808 --> 00:38:57.808]  it's too bad, next attack we're going to have a military dictatorship.
[00:38:57.808 --> 00:38:59.808]  That's what the people want.
[00:38:59.808 --> 00:39:02.808]  We see them pre-positioning and having open discussions
[00:39:02.808 --> 00:39:06.808]  and the Justice Department declaring total dictatorial power of the presidency.
[00:39:06.808 --> 00:39:10.808]  Clearly, would you concur that the elite is pre-positioning
[00:39:10.808 --> 00:39:14.808]  for a dictatorship in response to a depression?
[00:39:14.808 --> 00:39:17.808]  I think they're always prepared.
[00:39:17.808 --> 00:39:21.808]  And every day they have more powers than before
[00:39:21.808 --> 00:39:26.808]  because under these emergency powers act, the president now has more authority than ever.
[00:39:26.808 --> 00:39:29.808]  And the contest really that's going on in this presidential election is,
[00:39:29.808 --> 00:39:34.808]  are there enough of us who care about our freedoms
[00:39:34.808 --> 00:39:38.808]  versus those who are willing to succumb to the temptation of dictatorship?
[00:39:38.808 --> 00:39:42.808]  Just think of the attitude that what it was like right after 9-11
[00:39:42.808 --> 00:39:44.808]  when they passed the Patriot Act.
[00:39:44.808 --> 00:39:46.808]  I mean, there was no way, people.
[00:39:46.808 --> 00:39:49.808]  I had members of Congress tell me, I said, you know, it's not even available.
[00:39:49.808 --> 00:39:51.808]  You can't even read it and we're getting the radio vote.
[00:39:51.808 --> 00:39:53.808]  It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
[00:39:53.808 --> 00:39:55.808]  The people want us to do something.
[00:39:55.808 --> 00:39:57.808]  This looks like we're doing something that sounds good.
[00:39:57.808 --> 00:39:59.808]  There's no way I'm going to even question this.
[00:39:59.808 --> 00:40:01.808]  So they voted for it.
[00:40:01.808 --> 00:40:03.808]  And they got their signals from the people.
[00:40:03.808 --> 00:40:06.808]  And it's true, there's a lot of people that wanted something done.
[00:40:06.808 --> 00:40:08.808]  But it takes a while.
[00:40:08.808 --> 00:40:11.808]  So the big question is, are there more of them or more of us?
[00:40:11.808 --> 00:40:13.808]  And I think we have the answer there.
[00:40:13.808 --> 00:40:15.808]  There's going to be a fight regardless.
[00:40:15.808 --> 00:40:17.808]  Do you see any way of even stopping them attempting?
[00:40:17.808 --> 00:40:19.808]  Because they're already trying to set it up.
[00:40:19.808 --> 00:40:23.808]  Or do you just see the slow slide into this and we're now in the fight of our lives?
[00:40:23.808 --> 00:40:28.808]  Well, I think it's been sliding for a long time and it's getting worse.
[00:40:28.808 --> 00:40:30.808]  It got a lot worse after 9-11.
[00:40:30.808 --> 00:40:34.808]  And I'm always afraid of some concocted event that will scare the American people.
[00:40:34.808 --> 00:40:40.808]  You know, our country is probably not on the verge like tomorrow bombing Iran.
[00:40:40.808 --> 00:40:47.808]  But if they have some event, and that sort of that British thing was an event that they were probably contriving,
[00:40:47.808 --> 00:40:53.808]  hoping maybe that the Iranians would act more irrational and that we'd give them an excuse to start it and blame it on them.
[00:40:53.808 --> 00:40:59.808]  So the people in this country need a little bit more reason to go along with the president.
[00:40:59.808 --> 00:41:07.808]  But unfortunately, our leaders in this country too often have been able to provide the incident that unifies the country behind more militarism.
[00:41:07.808 --> 00:41:14.808]  I actually talked to the former head of the British Maritime Administration, and he was also the ambassador to Uzbekistan,
[00:41:14.808 --> 00:41:21.808]  and he said that the British were telling the truth that they were in Iraqi waters, but that the map was fake.
[00:41:21.808 --> 00:41:24.808]  It was a new map that never existed under any treaty.
[00:41:24.808 --> 00:41:28.808]  They just changed the map and then sent their sailors and marines in there.
[00:41:28.808 --> 00:41:30.808]  Yeah, well that's a possibility.
[00:41:30.808 --> 00:41:34.808]  I don't know the details of that, but that sounds very plausible.
[00:41:34.808 --> 00:41:36.808]  We're about to go to calls, Congressman.
[00:41:36.808 --> 00:41:42.808]  I just want to remind listeners out there that you can call 1-800-RON-PAUL for more information or to donate, 1-800-RON-PAUL.
[00:41:42.808 --> 00:41:46.808]  Or you can simply go to RonPaul2008.com.
[00:41:46.808 --> 00:41:52.808]  Ron Paul spelled P-A-U-L-2008.com with links up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:41:52.808 --> 00:41:58.808]  But in rapid shotgun effect, as we've done in the past, let me just throw out a few other questions to you.
[00:41:58.808 --> 00:42:03.808]  There's been a lot of neocon and liberal denials that the North American Union even exists,
[00:42:03.808 --> 00:42:07.808]  but now we got the four-year documents via judicial watch of the September meeting last year,
[00:42:07.808 --> 00:42:09.808]  where the first agenda was keep it secret.
[00:42:09.808 --> 00:42:15.808]  Second agenda, North American Union fuel tax, carbon tax, that's now racing ahead.
[00:42:15.808 --> 00:42:19.808]  Can we stop it, or what do you see happening with the North American Union?
[00:42:19.808 --> 00:42:23.808]  Well, at the moment, I don't see much resistance in Washington.
[00:42:23.808 --> 00:42:28.808]  So the resistance is in grassroots America, and that is building.
[00:42:28.808 --> 00:42:32.808]  I would say, yes, we can, but we still need a lot more support
[00:42:32.808 --> 00:42:38.808]  and a lot more messages sent to every single congressman up there to waken them to what is happening.
[00:42:38.808 --> 00:42:40.808]  And you're right, the evidence is there.
[00:42:40.808 --> 00:42:44.808]  They pretend that this is nothing, and they keep denying it.
[00:42:44.808 --> 00:42:49.808]  But I think the evidence is overwhelming that there's an intention long term, not next year.
[00:42:49.808 --> 00:42:53.808]  You're not going to have a North American Union next year. You're going to have it.
[00:42:53.808 --> 00:42:58.808]  You know, it was first it was GATT and WTO, and then NAFTA, and now the highways.
[00:42:58.808 --> 00:43:00.808]  Same thing with the EU, same thing with the EU.
[00:43:00.808 --> 00:43:02.808]  Yeah, I mean, how long did it take the EU to do it?
[00:43:02.808 --> 00:43:05.808]  I think it took them 50 years total, you know, from the very, very beginning.
[00:43:05.808 --> 00:43:08.808]  But with this, they have founded it with that SPP agreement,
[00:43:08.808 --> 00:43:12.808]  and now they're putting in the plumbing, but they've laid the foundation.
[00:43:12.808 --> 00:43:19.808]  Oh, yeah, it is there, and they've had the academic journalists at the CFR writing up the detailed plans.
[00:43:19.808 --> 00:43:22.808]  That's available to us on what exactly they want.
[00:43:22.808 --> 00:43:24.808]  I mean, that's where the term Amaro came from.
[00:43:24.808 --> 00:43:29.808]  Shifting gears again, if they attack Iran, do you think we'll see some type of draft?
[00:43:29.808 --> 00:43:31.808]  Because we're hearing the spin out of the Republicans and Democrats,
[00:43:31.808 --> 00:43:34.808]  oh, it won't be a draft, it'll be compulsory national service.
[00:43:34.808 --> 00:43:38.808]  Yeah, that's what the Democrats call it.
[00:43:38.808 --> 00:43:41.808]  That's a real obstacle for them.
[00:43:41.808 --> 00:43:45.808]  They're catch-22 because the American people aren't going to be very happy with the draft.
[00:43:45.808 --> 00:43:47.808]  They're going to rebel.
[00:43:47.808 --> 00:43:50.808]  This is one reason why so many of them remain in denial,
[00:43:50.808 --> 00:43:54.808]  saying, well, it doesn't affect me, I don't go, they're volunteers, let them suffer the consequences.
[00:43:54.808 --> 00:44:01.808]  But this is also the reason they're not likely to invade Iran.
[00:44:01.808 --> 00:44:07.808]  They're liable to bomb them, but then the Iranians are liable to move into southern Iraq or something,
[00:44:07.808 --> 00:44:11.808]  and then we'll feel compelled, and then they'll have to sell it to the American people.
[00:44:11.808 --> 00:44:15.808]  And then there might be a terrorist attack that all we've got to have is a draft.
[00:44:15.808 --> 00:44:17.808]  Yeah, that is it.
[00:44:18.808 --> 00:44:20.808]  Yeah, they're very capable.
[00:44:20.808 --> 00:44:24.808]  If they weren't capable of doing it, they would have gotten rid of selective service,
[00:44:24.808 --> 00:44:28.808]  which is something I've tried to do for 20 years, you know, get rid of it.
[00:44:28.808 --> 00:44:30.808]  We don't have a draft, we don't need it, we don't want it.
[00:44:30.808 --> 00:44:33.808]  We know they've reactivated the draft board, so they're clearly lurking around.
[00:44:33.808 --> 00:44:37.808]  Oh, yeah, it's there because they believe that they own us.
[00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:44.808]  And, you know, I think there's two things that tells me that these people in big government believe they own us.
[00:44:44.808 --> 00:44:49.808]  The first is the income tax, because if they can take, even if they only charge you 1% tax,
[00:44:49.808 --> 00:44:53.808]  that means they own 100%, they allow you to keep whatever percent they want.
[00:44:53.808 --> 00:44:57.808]  So they own you through the income tax, but the other is the idea of the draft,
[00:44:57.808 --> 00:45:04.808]  the fact that they can call you up and send you off to fight UN wars that become no-win wasteful wars.
[00:45:04.808 --> 00:45:07.808]  That means they believe they own us and they own our kids,
[00:45:07.808 --> 00:45:11.808]  and that is, to me, devastating to the principles of liberty.
[00:45:11.808 --> 00:45:13.808]  The state is not God. Congressman, let's go to calls.
[00:45:13.808 --> 00:45:16.808]  Mark just hung up from Atlanta. We'll go to Richard in Texas.
[00:45:16.808 --> 00:45:21.808]  Richard, you're on the air with Congressman Ron Paul making a run for it for president.
[00:45:21.808 --> 00:45:24.808]  Thank God for you, Ron. I'm sure glad you're doing this.
[00:45:24.808 --> 00:45:30.808]  You're our only viable hope, and just wanted to ask you quickly if you could give a brief overview
[00:45:30.808 --> 00:45:37.808]  on how you would see the dismantling of the Federal Reserve and, you know, sort of the impact of that.
[00:45:37.808 --> 00:45:43.808]  It's obviously one of the deepest evils that kind of ride over all these issues that we're facing. Thank you.
[00:45:43.808 --> 00:45:49.808]  Well, even I, who can't stand the Fed and we shouldn't have its unconstitution, we need to get rid of it,
[00:45:49.808 --> 00:45:54.808]  I would not say tomorrow you should close down the Federal Reserve. It would be very, very chaotic.
[00:45:54.808 --> 00:45:59.808]  The first thing we need to do is legalize competition, that is, legalize the Constitution,
[00:45:59.808 --> 00:46:04.808]  that gold and silver should be legal tender in competition with the monopoly money,
[00:46:04.808 --> 00:46:09.808]  which is the Federal Reserve note, which means that you take off all taxes and regulations,
[00:46:09.808 --> 00:46:18.808]  no sales taxes or income tax on any types of gold transactions to make it money.
[00:46:18.808 --> 00:46:21.808]  And this would be one step in the right direction.
[00:46:21.808 --> 00:46:26.808]  By the way, you've introduced legislation to shut down the Fed and then in that you walk through the process.
[00:46:26.808 --> 00:46:32.808]  Right. And the other thing is, without closing the door immediately,
[00:46:32.808 --> 00:46:37.808]  then the next step would be to deny the Federal Reserve the power to monetize debt,
[00:46:37.808 --> 00:46:41.808]  to take a Treasury bill and then literally create money out of thin air.
[00:46:41.808 --> 00:46:46.808]  And this would immediately put restraints on the politicians.
[00:46:46.808 --> 00:46:49.808]  The politicians like the Federal Reserve because that means they can spend to build their...
[00:46:49.808 --> 00:46:51.808]  That would kill their whole magic trick system.
[00:46:51.808 --> 00:46:58.808]  Yeah, they would consider that the Federal Reserve would be a check clearing house and nothing more.
[00:46:58.808 --> 00:47:05.808]  But the whole gimmick is that they want the power to create money out of thin air and fool the people and deceive the people.
[00:47:05.808 --> 00:47:08.808]  So how long to get the heroin addict congressman off?
[00:47:08.808 --> 00:47:11.808]  I mean, how long would it take then to wean us off this system?
[00:47:11.808 --> 00:47:15.808]  Well, it depends on the conditions. If you started today, it could take a while and it would be tedious
[00:47:15.808 --> 00:47:18.808]  and it would be hard to get people to support it.
[00:47:18.808 --> 00:47:23.808]  I think we're going to have the financial crisis and then they will be forced to do it.
[00:47:23.808 --> 00:47:26.808]  And maybe we could even do it more dramatically than I propose.
[00:47:26.808 --> 00:47:29.808]  My suggestion is under today's conditions.
[00:47:29.808 --> 00:47:33.808]  But if you have total collapse of the financial system and rejection of the dollar,
[00:47:33.808 --> 00:47:38.808]  you have to restore confidence and therefore you have to make the money worth something.
[00:47:38.808 --> 00:47:40.808]  It has to have some value to it again.
[00:47:40.808 --> 00:47:44.808]  Or they will not believe you if you just say, oh, well, we'll quit printing the money.
[00:47:44.808 --> 00:47:47.808]  Eventually the people will lose trust in the money.
[00:47:47.808 --> 00:47:50.808]  They know, though, what their real plan is, but they're not ready for it.
[00:47:50.808 --> 00:47:52.808]  That's why they're trying to shore it up for now.
[00:47:52.808 --> 00:47:56.808]  Let it implode and then come out with a national ID card slash credit card system,
[00:47:56.808 --> 00:47:59.808]  which goes cashless, and they're shooting for 2011.
[00:47:59.808 --> 00:48:02.808]  Yeah, those plans are being laid too.
[00:48:02.808 --> 00:48:07.808]  And I've heard debates on that where, why mess around with cash anymore?
[00:48:07.808 --> 00:48:10.808]  Well, I mean, my point is, we've got to have you in there as president.
[00:48:10.808 --> 00:48:14.808]  We've got to, bottom line, raise awareness of the real political financial paradigm
[00:48:14.808 --> 00:48:18.808]  so that they can't stage things again and then act like they're the saviors
[00:48:18.808 --> 00:48:21.808]  when they're the progenitors of the mess we're in.
[00:48:21.808 --> 00:48:24.808]  Let's talk to Eric in Washington.
[00:48:24.808 --> 00:48:26.808]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Eric.
[00:48:26.808 --> 00:48:28.808]  Oh, hey, Alex, a great show.
[00:48:28.808 --> 00:48:31.808]  I'm so humbled just to be here and talk face-to-face
[00:48:31.808 --> 00:48:34.808]  with the future president of the United States.
[00:48:34.808 --> 00:48:35.808]  Thank you.
[00:48:35.808 --> 00:48:38.808]  What I want to ask, though, is that I really love your style, Ron Paul.
[00:48:38.808 --> 00:48:40.808]  I saw you on the Bill Maher show.
[00:48:40.808 --> 00:48:44.808]  You were a little meek there, but you speak softly,
[00:48:44.808 --> 00:48:47.808]  but you carry a big stick, and I really appreciate that.
[00:48:47.808 --> 00:48:50.808]  Well, he absolutely mopped the floor with Bill Maher.
[00:48:50.808 --> 00:48:53.808]  Oh, yeah, rhetorically, yeah, he had nothing against you,
[00:48:53.808 --> 00:48:56.808]  but Bill Maher's really snide cynicism can really cut through,
[00:48:56.808 --> 00:49:00.808]  and the sleepers, they're not going to know what's going on.
[00:49:00.808 --> 00:49:03.808]  But I'm doing my part, grassroots.
[00:49:03.808 --> 00:49:05.808]  Just getting one-on-one with my friends
[00:49:05.808 --> 00:49:08.808]  and tell them about you and your campaign.
[00:49:08.808 --> 00:49:10.808]  What I really want from you, though,
[00:49:10.808 --> 00:49:13.808]  is the guarantee that you're going to be the man for the job.
[00:49:13.808 --> 00:49:16.808]  Well, I don't know what you mean by the guarantee.
[00:49:16.808 --> 00:49:19.808]  I can guarantee that I'm going to be out there fighting this battle
[00:49:19.808 --> 00:49:22.808]  and delivering the message and doing my very best,
[00:49:22.808 --> 00:49:26.808]  and I never know what the results will absolutely be.
[00:49:26.808 --> 00:49:28.808]  I don't have control of the future.
[00:49:28.808 --> 00:49:31.808]  Within his constitutional restraints, as I've heard him say it,
[00:49:31.808 --> 00:49:33.808]  within the Constitution, you can do everything you can
[00:49:33.808 --> 00:49:36.808]  to reduce government and restore the Constitution to the republic, correct?
[00:49:36.808 --> 00:49:38.808]  That's absolutely the case.
[00:49:38.808 --> 00:49:41.808]  I didn't know whether he meant in the campaign or after the election.
[00:49:41.808 --> 00:49:46.808]  So, no, after the election, there's a lot you can do.
[00:49:46.808 --> 00:49:49.808]  Just like the first thing I mentioned was you're the Commander-in-Chief,
[00:49:49.808 --> 00:49:52.808]  and you can do a lot to reduce the spending overseas.
[00:49:52.808 --> 00:49:56.808]  There's no reason, even though I don't believe in changing government
[00:49:56.808 --> 00:49:59.808]  through the executive order, I don't think there'd be any reason
[00:49:59.808 --> 00:50:03.808]  why you can't repeal executive orders that have been so detrimental to us.
[00:50:03.808 --> 00:50:06.808]  I mean, I would think that would be very legitimate for a constitutional president
[00:50:06.808 --> 00:50:09.808]  to get rid of the laws the president wrote himself.
[00:50:09.808 --> 00:50:12.808]  Sure. Does that answer your question?
[00:50:12.808 --> 00:50:16.808]  Yeah, too, and also is that this political game is really tricky.
[00:50:16.808 --> 00:50:19.808]  You know, there's voter fraud and there's media propaganda.
[00:50:19.808 --> 00:50:21.808]  What are you going to do to bring it to the front line
[00:50:21.808 --> 00:50:24.808]  if there is, you know, a dispute in the votes?
[00:50:24.808 --> 00:50:26.808]  Or if you don't win the primary, are you just going to go independent
[00:50:26.808 --> 00:50:28.808]  and bring it forth even more?
[00:50:28.808 --> 00:50:30.808]  Well, I haven't thought about that.
[00:50:30.808 --> 00:50:33.808]  I think about, as a matter of fact, leaving here within an hour
[00:50:33.808 --> 00:50:36.808]  to go to Iowa and campaign, but I think you're right.
[00:50:36.808 --> 00:50:38.808]  I did have one election stolen from me,
[00:50:38.808 --> 00:50:40.808]  and that's something you have to be alert to,
[00:50:40.808 --> 00:50:44.808]  and it's a little bit more complicated and sophisticated now, but it's very rare.
[00:50:44.808 --> 00:50:47.808]  We've got a break. We've got a break. Stay there. Final segment.
[00:50:52.808 --> 00:50:55.808]  It's here. After a year in production and traveling to distant lands,
[00:50:55.808 --> 00:50:57.808]  my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:50:57.808 --> 00:50:59.808]  Shocking declassified government documents prove
[00:50:59.808 --> 00:51:02.808]  that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks
[00:51:02.808 --> 00:51:05.808]  against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:05.808 --> 00:51:09.808]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job,
[00:51:09.808 --> 00:51:13.808]  but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:13.808 --> 00:51:16.808]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran,
[00:51:16.808 --> 00:51:20.808]  a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:20.808 --> 00:51:25.808]  secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:25.808 --> 00:51:29.808]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:29.808 --> 00:51:31.808]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:31.808 --> 00:51:36.808]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:49.808 --> 00:52:51.808]  Hello, friends. Alex Jones here.
[00:52:51.808 --> 00:52:55.808]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:52:55.808 --> 00:53:02.808]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more,
[00:53:02.808 --> 00:53:04.808]  all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:04.808 --> 00:53:09.808]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:09.808 --> 00:53:13.808]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your Internet connection on,
[00:53:13.808 --> 00:53:18.808]  you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:53:55.808 --> 00:53:58.808]  I'm going to blitz through your calls for the Congressman.
[00:53:58.808 --> 00:54:02.808]  Let's talk to Todd in Kentucky. You're on the air with Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:54:02.808 --> 00:54:06.808]  Yes. Thank you, Congressman Ron Paul, for running. We really appreciate it.
[00:54:06.808 --> 00:54:11.808]  My question to you is, is that what kind of resistance is your staff finding
[00:54:11.808 --> 00:54:15.808]  when you try and get on to, like, Lou Dobbs and O'Reilly?
[00:54:15.808 --> 00:54:17.808]  Well, Lou Dobbs has had him twice.
[00:54:17.808 --> 00:54:19.808]  Yeah, matter of fact, I was scheduled. They did bump me.
[00:54:19.808 --> 00:54:20.808]  You were scheduled last night.
[00:54:20.808 --> 00:54:22.808]  Yeah, but it was a legitimate bump.
[00:54:22.808 --> 00:54:25.808]  They wanted to do more on Imus, and they promised me even more time,
[00:54:25.808 --> 00:54:29.808]  and I think it'll be beginning of next week sometime that I will be on his show again.
[00:54:29.808 --> 00:54:31.808]  CNN's been very nice.
[00:54:31.808 --> 00:54:36.808]  I think Fox, they had to have a lot of our supporters calling in there,
[00:54:36.808 --> 00:54:38.808]  and that made a difference.
[00:54:38.808 --> 00:54:42.808]  Let's not criticize the wrong people. CNN's been doing a good job.
[00:54:42.808 --> 00:54:47.808]  Let's encourage more. But Fox, MSNBC, I mean, we need to get him on there.
[00:54:47.808 --> 00:54:52.808]  Yeah, we need to, because obviously every time they mention the candidates,
[00:54:52.808 --> 00:54:54.808]  they always skip over Mr. Paul.
[00:54:54.808 --> 00:54:58.808]  We need to make sure, exactly, they are censoring our Congressman comments.
[00:54:58.808 --> 00:55:01.808]  You know, the one show that I would like to get on,
[00:55:01.808 --> 00:55:05.808]  because I know he's very sympathetic to our views, even though he's a liberal,
[00:55:05.808 --> 00:55:07.808]  and that is Chris Matthews.
[00:55:07.808 --> 00:55:10.808]  Many of our things, like on The War, he's been sympathetic,
[00:55:10.808 --> 00:55:12.808]  but I haven't been invited to be on his show.
[00:55:12.808 --> 00:55:14.808]  We need to get you on Meet the Press.
[00:55:14.808 --> 00:55:19.808]  Well, that won't come right soon, but I'd have to perk up even more in the polls,
[00:55:19.808 --> 00:55:21.808]  but I mean, that should be our goal.
[00:55:21.808 --> 00:55:25.808]  Well, you can perk up. If they give you the coverage, you'll perk up.
[00:55:25.808 --> 00:55:28.808]  They're not even allowing him to be in the polls when they give him.
[00:55:28.808 --> 00:55:30.808]  And they won't even let you be in the debates.
[00:55:30.808 --> 00:55:33.808]  And when you describe the Congressman and Senators,
[00:55:33.808 --> 00:55:36.808]  I respect you the way you talk about them,
[00:55:36.808 --> 00:55:39.808]  but basically, in my opinion, humble opinion,
[00:55:39.808 --> 00:55:41.808]  they're nothing but crooks and traitors to their country.
[00:55:41.808 --> 00:55:42.808]  Well, a lot of them certainly are.
[00:55:42.808 --> 00:55:44.808]  And that's really all they really are.
[00:55:44.808 --> 00:55:47.808]  Sure. Congressman, when is that CNN debate coming up?
[00:55:47.808 --> 00:55:51.808]  The CNN, well, you mean Lou Dobbs?
[00:55:51.808 --> 00:55:53.808]  No, I mean, I always thought there was going to be a presidential debate.
[00:55:53.808 --> 00:55:57.808]  Yeah, there's a presidential debate, and I think it's the 4th of May.
[00:55:57.808 --> 00:55:59.808]  It's in California at the Ronald Reagan Library.
[00:55:59.808 --> 00:56:00.808]  There are 10.
[00:56:00.808 --> 00:56:05.808]  So all the candidates have responded, and that's going to be carried on MSNBC.
[00:56:05.808 --> 00:56:08.808]  So that should be a good opportunity for us.
[00:56:08.808 --> 00:56:10.808]  Absolutely. That'll be a big breakout point.
[00:56:10.808 --> 00:56:12.808]  Let's talk to Gabe in South Dakota.
[00:56:12.808 --> 00:56:14.808]  Let's get a few more in. Gabe, go ahead.
[00:56:14.808 --> 00:56:16.808]  Oh, hey, guys.
[00:56:16.808 --> 00:56:18.808]  I listen to the Jones Report every day.
[00:56:18.808 --> 00:56:22.808]  I support Alex Jones, and I support Ron Paul for president.
[00:56:22.808 --> 00:56:25.808]  And I want to ask Ron a question.
[00:56:25.808 --> 00:56:32.808]  I think what this situation needs also, besides you running for president, is we need to, like we did with Defend Rosie,
[00:56:32.808 --> 00:56:38.808]  create an online petition for citizens' arrest of our government.
[00:56:38.808 --> 00:56:41.808]  We need 51% of the public to sign it.
[00:56:41.808 --> 00:56:43.808]  We need to outlaw secrecy in the government.
[00:56:43.808 --> 00:56:47.808]  Anyone who's part of a secret society, we need to try them in a jury trial.
[00:56:47.808 --> 00:56:51.808]  We need to arrest the 9-11 perpetrator suspects.
[00:56:51.808 --> 00:56:54.808]  And I think they can all await trial at a freedom camp.
[00:56:54.808 --> 00:56:59.808]  Well, we've got to be careful about taking the government back because revolution can be dangerous.
[00:56:59.808 --> 00:57:02.808]  I want a restoration. It can go into tyranny itself.
[00:57:02.808 --> 00:57:04.808]  Thank you for the call. Congressman, you want to comment on that?
[00:57:04.808 --> 00:57:09.808]  Yeah, just very carefully. That was a lot of things I'd have to accomplish rather quickly.
[00:57:09.808 --> 00:57:15.808]  But I think the one important point was that governments have no right to be secret
[00:57:15.808 --> 00:57:18.808]  except under these very, very rare national security reasons.
[00:57:18.808 --> 00:57:22.808]  But we have too much government secrecy in the purpose of the government.
[00:57:22.808 --> 00:57:27.808]  My purpose as president would be to protect your privacy, not the government's secrecy.
[00:57:27.808 --> 00:57:29.808]  They have it backwards now.
[00:57:29.808 --> 00:57:34.808]  Our privacy means nothing to them, whether it's medical privacy, financial privacy,
[00:57:34.808 --> 00:57:39.808]  you know, the national ID card, the whole works, and yet government becomes more secret every day.
[00:57:39.808 --> 00:57:44.808]  Did you hear about this big law professor who gave a speech critical to Bush and now they put him on the no-fly list?
[00:57:44.808 --> 00:57:48.808]  I saw that. That was a scary story when I read that.
[00:57:48.808 --> 00:57:52.808]  I'll tell you, you know, that should wake everybody up.
[00:57:52.808 --> 00:57:59.808]  Congressman, the website is ronpaul2008.com, 1-800-RON-PAUL, 1-800-RON-PAUL.
[00:57:59.808 --> 00:58:03.808]  Call, donate, support him. If you can't, you know, volunteers, find out how you get yard signs,
[00:58:03.808 --> 00:58:06.808]  how you get out there, you know, call the media, tell them to cover him.
[00:58:06.808 --> 00:58:11.808]  That's how we do this. And he's already raised a lot of money for just launching his campaign.
[00:58:11.808 --> 00:58:16.808]  Let's increase that. Congressman, Godspeed to you and safe travels for you and your staff.
[00:58:16.808 --> 00:58:21.808]  And I want to thank your family for supporting you in this as well. We really appreciate what you're doing.
[00:58:21.808 --> 00:58:23.808]  Thank you, Alex. Good to be with you.
[00:58:23.808 --> 00:58:27.808]  You bet. Take care. There goes the man who could become the next president. We'll be right back.
