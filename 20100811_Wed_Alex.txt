[00:56.320 --> 01:02.200]  here that we'll be covering after the break Iraq needs US military support
[01:02.200 --> 01:07.680]  until 2020 what a surprise seven years ago that was the Pentagon's official
[01:07.680 --> 01:11.280]  position of course they lie to the public and say oh we're leaving next
[01:11.280 --> 01:15.960]  year then the next year comes oh we're leaving the year after that don't don't
[01:15.960 --> 01:20.440]  don't don't say that we lied to you it's a conspiracy theory if you question
[01:20.440 --> 01:26.360]  anything government does fears of al-Qaeda return in Iraq is US backed
[01:26.360 --> 01:31.120]  fighters defect you mean they're paid to stage more terror attacks as a pretext
[01:31.120 --> 01:34.320]  to stay as they've been caught repeatedly on record including British
[01:34.320 --> 01:39.840]  special forces staging terror attacks against Iraqis and US forces that's
[01:39.840 --> 01:44.640]  London Guardian the Times of London all admitted continuing will Iraq fall
[01:44.640 --> 01:49.960]  victim to the oil curse Wall Street Journal more on Google and Verizon
[01:49.960 --> 01:54.840]  announcing that they're seizing the once free internet as it is known and
[01:54.840 --> 02:02.920]  taking control of it in our society that is coming up as well Iran retaliates
[02:02.920 --> 02:10.560]  against sanctions is to quote drop all trade in filthy euro and the dollar so
[02:10.560 --> 02:14.320]  that is being announced we'll talk about what effects that'll have on the
[02:14.320 --> 02:20.040]  economy world stock markets are plunging globally today and the dollar is up they
[02:20.040 --> 02:23.840]  just race from currency to currency currencies go up then they go down but
[02:23.840 --> 02:28.960]  overall they're going down Iran warns we have dug mass graves for your soldiers
[02:28.960 --> 02:33.680]  in response to us attack threat so lots of saber rattling going on back and
[02:33.680 --> 02:40.600]  forth and Russia's gasoline plant resumes supply to Iran and trade Reuters
[02:40.600 --> 02:47.120]  reports and we'll be breaking down all of those developments on the economy CNBC
[02:47.120 --> 02:52.120]  has the headline America is bankrupt and a Mickey Mouse economy similar to Russia
[02:52.120 --> 02:58.080]  in the 1990s Peter Schiff says we're in the early stages of depression I agree
[02:58.080 --> 03:01.720]  with him and 15 economic statistics that just keep getting worse from the
[03:01.720 --> 03:06.120]  economic collapse website posted up at info wars dot com and prison planet
[03:06.120 --> 03:10.640]  dot com to going over those also when university scientists found underwater
[03:10.640 --> 03:15.960]  oil plumes the government said shut up don't tell anyone and then tried to
[03:15.960 --> 03:21.600]  discredit them and George Washington blog always does a great job we carry
[03:21.600 --> 03:26.480]  it at info wars and prison planet has boiled down all the mainstream
[03:26.480 --> 03:30.520]  scientists and major university heads that have been out in the Gulf studying
[03:30.520 --> 03:34.920]  and saying it's still leaking upwards of 20 miles away but the media says and the
[03:34.920 --> 03:41.560]  government says shut up we say the oil spill is over and 70% cleaned up which
[03:41.560 --> 03:46.240]  of course is total propaganda but if you question it you are a conspiracy
[03:46.240 --> 03:51.120]  theorist if you question any forms of corruption or any problems you are a
[03:51.120 --> 03:55.200]  conspiracy theorist we have a c-span clip where they had one of the former
[03:55.200 --> 03:58.960]  heads of counterterrorism on and he just every time they called in and brought
[03:58.960 --> 04:03.040]  up government sponsored terror and documents and members of the military
[04:03.040 --> 04:07.240]  and Pentagon going public about it in the 9-11 Commission going public the
[04:07.240 --> 04:11.640]  guest and the host of the CNN Washington Journal the c-span Washington
[04:11.640 --> 04:14.960]  Journal would just say conspiracy theory that's just their answer to
[04:14.960 --> 04:18.360]  everything if you say Halliburton's corrupt conspiracy theory if you say
[04:18.360 --> 04:22.240]  Enron's corrupt conspiracy theory for 11 years if you said Bernie Madoff was
[04:22.240 --> 04:25.720]  running a Ponzi scheme conspiracy theory if you say taxes are too high
[04:25.720 --> 04:28.880]  conspiracy theory or if you say you don't want government run health care
[04:28.880 --> 04:34.000]  you're a racist that's just it's just the default positions that's just some of
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.720]  the news that's coming up they're also announcing what I first saw about 12
[04:38.720 --> 04:42.840]  years ago in the news but now it's being pushed as legislation cameras in all
[04:42.840 --> 04:48.880]  cars watching you whenever you drive your car and they're also announcing the
[04:48.880 --> 04:52.000]  major airlines to have cameras in them face scanning you and recording
[04:52.000 --> 04:56.640]  everything you do including audio maybe put up with naked body scanners that
[04:56.640 --> 05:01.000]  maybe on radiation why not we'll be right back stay with us the question is
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.720]  where should the American people draw their line in the sand what have we

[05:11.080 --> 05:15.480]  protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep

[08:35.480 --> 08:39.720]  live on air to take your calls and cover the scientific dictatorship that we
[08:39.720 --> 08:47.800]  face as a human society i want to go over the immigration developments the
[08:47.800 --> 08:52.120]  fact the democratic party is in free fall the republican party is in deep
[08:52.120 --> 08:57.640]  trouble as the public really awakens and has a full paradigm shift we've also
[08:57.640 --> 09:04.360]  confirmed we first reported on this on sunday that in kentucky democrats are
[09:04.360 --> 09:09.040]  dressing up like tea party people and going out and calling hispanics and
[09:09.040 --> 09:16.760]  black people your names and demonizing patriots and libertarians as racist but
[09:16.760 --> 09:20.440]  now it's been confirmed that some of the local newspapers in kentucky were
[09:20.440 --> 09:26.920]  running reports about these provocateurs and including video reports and so
[09:26.920 --> 09:32.680]  they're just all tied in together running these type of false flags against
[09:32.680 --> 09:38.920]  candidates that are anti-globalist pro republic pro freedom so we'll also be
[09:38.920 --> 09:48.280]  getting into some of those reports today as well but before i go any further i

[10:00.320 --> 10:05.040]  also look at the major decline in the stock markets not just here in the
[10:05.040 --> 10:10.400]  united states or europe but in asia as well today and what is behind that the
[10:10.400 --> 10:21.320]  toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231-800-259-9231 but first let's
[10:21.320 --> 10:26.360]  get into this news and information and later in the next hour if i have time i'm
[10:26.360 --> 10:31.880]  going to play a rt piece that i was on yesterday where i was on for 11 minutes
[10:31.880 --> 10:37.000]  and cover two different subjects a the fact that net neutrality is being ended
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.360]  and the internet as we know it is in the process of being dismantled it will
[10:40.360 --> 10:45.320]  take several years just under this current particular attack but there's a
[10:45.320 --> 10:49.320]  multifaceted attack going on but this particular one will cripple it and end
[10:49.320 --> 10:54.120]  it as we know it you won't be able to access an access info wars dot com and
[10:54.120 --> 10:58.200]  prison planet dot com but not just our sites not just quote conspiracy sites
[10:58.200 --> 11:01.160]  that dare question the mainstream media and the government propaganda and
[11:01.160 --> 11:06.680]  disinformation lies but just all sites that do not pave a rise in google and
[11:06.680 --> 11:11.960]  time Warner and at&t and and less than 10 of these mega telecommunications
[11:11.960 --> 11:19.000]  cartels that are now seizing the web in the second part of the video they
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.600]  brought up the fact that the airlines are now doing that they're not talking
[11:22.600 --> 11:26.760]  about it they're now beginning to deploy it
[11:26.760 --> 11:31.560]  and that is cameras in every seat when you're in an airplane a commercial
[11:31.560 --> 11:36.280]  passenger jetliner of course you're facing unless you're
[11:36.280 --> 11:39.320]  facing the bulkhead you're facing the back seat
[11:39.320 --> 11:43.640]  and you've got the the tray there you can lower down in the magazine rack
[11:43.640 --> 11:49.400]  they are now going to put cameras in all of those that feed into a
[11:49.400 --> 11:53.160]  artificially intelligent computer system they claim it's pure quackery
[11:53.160 --> 11:57.080]  and if you're sweating or if you go to the bathroom too much
[11:57.080 --> 12:03.800]  it will alert a computer in the cockpit that will then alert interpol
[12:03.800 --> 12:07.800]  and all other major police agencies on the earth
[12:07.800 --> 12:12.520]  and it also has microphones most importantly recording everything you do
[12:12.520 --> 12:16.680]  everything you talk about with your children your wife your business partners
[12:16.680 --> 12:20.840]  who are flying with you this is just the nsa globally
[12:20.840 --> 12:25.080]  announcing everything will be surveilled in the last 20 years it started in
[12:25.080 --> 12:31.400]  england uh 13 years ago uh in 1997 in austin texas
[12:31.400 --> 12:35.240]  now it's in every major western city and even small towns
[12:35.240 --> 12:39.240]  when they announce them to the local slaves the cover story is always
[12:39.240 --> 12:43.720]  gunshot detectors now they've dispensed with that cover story and they said
[12:43.720 --> 12:48.680]  we're listening to you with microphones that are shotgun meaning they can
[12:48.680 --> 12:52.440]  listen to you at upwards of 200 yards the companies in city council
[12:52.440 --> 12:55.320]  presentations that we've covered around the country
[12:55.320 --> 12:58.600]  brag the police at their threat fusion centers
[12:58.600 --> 13:03.000]  uh of course are just now being told about the microphones
[13:03.000 --> 13:07.560]  it's they've put the grid in test it only the nsa and private corporations are
[13:07.560 --> 13:11.320]  allowed to access it and then now the police at higher levels are being
[13:11.320 --> 13:15.720]  federally and internationally deputized and becoming liaison to
[13:15.720 --> 13:21.640]  infraguard cia fbi databases face scanning cameras
[13:21.640 --> 13:26.280]  biometric cameras that scan your walk cameras that actually
[13:26.280 --> 13:31.080]  project different millimeter waves that look through your clothes
[13:31.080 --> 13:34.680]  they claim for weapons but if you actually read the specs it's a biometric scan
[13:34.680 --> 13:37.320]  and of course the biometric fingerprint they receive when you go through the
[13:37.320 --> 13:40.040]  naked body scanners or when you go to the upper
[13:40.040 --> 13:44.600]  echelon clothing stores for your quote tailored fitting through the biometric
[13:44.600 --> 13:47.480]  scanners that are now in thousands of different locations around the world
[13:47.480 --> 13:51.560]  it's all then second party third party sold
[13:51.560 --> 13:55.800]  that's why target and barns and nobles will offer you 10 off now
[13:55.800 --> 13:59.800]  every time you go in to buy something at first it was just get the card you get
[13:59.800 --> 14:04.440]  10 the first time now it's every time because they're selling the data and
[14:04.440 --> 14:07.640]  they claim legally when you sign off on that
[14:07.640 --> 14:10.680]  then they're allowed to sell your data that that's how they get around the
[14:10.680 --> 14:14.840]  government having to get a fifth amendment or fourth amendment
[14:14.840 --> 14:20.120]  or mainly fourth amendment warrant to do it
[14:20.120 --> 14:25.560]  remember in 2000 there was the headlines scoff laws get caught
[14:25.560 --> 14:30.040]  when they ordered pizza that guys pull that up for prison planet dot tv viewers
[14:30.040 --> 14:32.920]  just scoff laws get caught ordering pizzas
[14:32.920 --> 14:37.720]  that's the headline us say today and it said the big three pizza companies
[14:37.720 --> 14:40.440]  that have more than half the market in the u.s and it's now almost all the
[14:40.440 --> 14:44.680]  major pizza companies and and other places you you you order for
[14:44.680 --> 14:51.240]  delivery when they run your phone number and your
[14:51.240 --> 14:57.000]  credit card that they demand it goes through a database that indexes and
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.440]  keeps tabs on you and then if you've got a warrant out
[15:00.440 --> 15:03.160]  that goes into a database if it's not a high priority then they can come to your
[15:03.160 --> 15:06.280]  house a week later knowing your real address but if it's a high priority
[15:06.280 --> 15:09.720]  your swat team within two hours the pizzas of course delivered so you
[15:09.720 --> 15:12.200]  don't notice the person taking the order doesn't even know
[15:12.200 --> 15:15.400]  i mean the point is everything is being integrated now remember
[15:15.400 --> 15:18.680]  about 10 years ago toyota and general motors
[15:18.680 --> 15:26.040]  as part of pentagon grants we're looking at putting cameras in the top of
[15:26.040 --> 15:30.760]  the rearview mirror a small camera it's just a pinpoint camera
[15:30.760 --> 15:33.800]  that by law will hook into a cell phone package
[15:33.800 --> 15:40.680]  similar to on starb that will then be punched in by the pentagon by the nsa
[15:40.680 --> 15:44.600]  by the local federalization threat fusion centers
[15:44.600 --> 15:49.320]  and then i saw a governor admit that of wisconsin in 2003 that's in the film
[15:49.320 --> 15:53.400]  matrix of evil 2004 mainstream green bay
[15:53.400 --> 15:57.320]  newspaper with the governor said too much at a threat fusion
[15:57.320 --> 16:01.160]  senator and said we type in here it calls up where you're at real-time or
[16:01.160 --> 16:05.080]  cell phone we type in here it listens to your cell phone even if it's off
[16:05.080 --> 16:09.400]  and we type in here and in the future there'll be cameras tracking you
[16:09.400 --> 16:14.840]  and so that's all mainstream news now today and it's just going in and it's
[16:14.840 --> 16:17.800]  just the way it is and and again it's to totally
[16:17.800 --> 16:21.560]  surveil and have ai computers listening to every word you say
[16:21.560 --> 16:25.720]  and they're just announcing it in your face has nothing to do with cia run
[16:25.720 --> 16:29.720]  men that live in caves okay let's just be clear they fund them to kill our
[16:29.720 --> 16:33.720]  troops keep the war going they they both fund the opposition
[16:33.720 --> 16:37.320]  and the war itself it's called full spectrum dominance
[16:37.320 --> 16:40.840]  now there it is Missouri tracks scoff laws via pizza delivery databases
[16:40.840 --> 16:48.360]  usa today and uh that is actually 2004 but i first
[16:48.360 --> 16:51.800]  saw that in 2000 there it is for you
[16:51.800 --> 16:55.000]  okay let's continue in-flight surveillance could foil
[16:55.000 --> 17:01.160]  terrorists in the sky and it goes on to say the big brother is not
[17:01.160 --> 17:05.080]  bad now big brother is there to help you and that's also
[17:05.080 --> 17:09.560]  in the tv piece when they interview uh one of the
[17:09.560 --> 17:12.920]  scientists a computer scientist that's to develop this he says big brother's not
[17:12.920 --> 17:16.680]  bad big brother is here to help and of course in 1984 big
[17:16.680 --> 17:21.800]  brother was there a watchful big brother and it goes on cctv cameras are
[17:21.800 --> 17:26.280]  bringing more and more public places under surveillance
[17:26.280 --> 17:30.200]  and passenger aircraft could be next uh well actually they've announced the
[17:30.200 --> 17:33.960]  purchases are being made a prototype european system
[17:33.960 --> 17:37.240]  uses multiple cameras and big brother software that's what they call it
[17:37.240 --> 17:40.840]  so it's all in your face uh to try and automatically detect
[17:40.840 --> 17:44.120]  terrorists or other dangers caused by passengers
[17:44.120 --> 17:48.520]  the european union security and aircraft in future european environment
[17:48.520 --> 17:53.160]  or safe uh project uses the camera in every passenger seat
[17:53.160 --> 17:57.160]  with six wide-angle cameras per per individual
[17:57.160 --> 18:01.320]  to survey the aisles uh software uh the
[18:01.320 --> 18:04.840]  analyzes the footage to detect developing terrorist activity
[18:04.840 --> 18:10.360]  on air rage incidents by tracking passengers facial expressions
[18:10.360 --> 18:13.480]  these are already in most airports it's all quackery they walk over your
[18:13.480 --> 18:16.680]  sweating uh yeah i just hauled my stuff out of
[18:16.680 --> 18:21.080]  the parking garage 300 yards and it's 103 degrees out there
[18:21.080 --> 18:24.920]  and yeah i'm sweating uh well you look irritated uh yeah i
[18:24.920 --> 18:29.480]  happened to have a stomach ache or i just happened to get a call that
[18:29.480 --> 18:34.520]  being audited yeah i'm in a bad mood or i just got a call that my uh
[18:34.520 --> 18:39.000]  my wife was in a car wreck punk yeah you bet i'm sweating and look angry
[18:39.000 --> 18:43.160]  yeah you bet i'm even more angry talking to you

[18:55.560 --> 18:58.760]  everybody knows you're paid 14 bucks an hour to be a pervert everybody knows
[18:58.760 --> 19:03.480]  it's a fraud that's what i really want to say to you
[19:05.320 --> 19:08.680]  but in some news reports it's to fight terrorists and others it's for
[19:08.680 --> 19:13.240]  anger on the airplanes i mean i've been on these airplanes and either the
[19:13.240 --> 19:16.600]  flight attendants the sturdices who political correctness i just
[19:16.600 --> 19:22.120]  violated a thought crime saying sturdice if you
[19:22.120 --> 19:26.280]  they're either real nice or they're looking for trouble
[19:26.280 --> 19:31.640]  i've seen them puff up to people bow up to people
[19:31.640 --> 19:34.920]  and see that's how tyranny works all these little petty people get this
[19:34.920 --> 19:38.520]  petty thugism through the system and they get to oppress you
[19:38.520 --> 19:41.720]  so i thought we go over that and then cbs news is announcing a federal

[22:11.560 --> 22:14.840]  portfolios from losing value the answer to all of this is gold and
[22:14.840 --> 22:17.080]  silver they've both maintained their purchasing
[22:17.080 --> 22:21.480]  power for 6 000 years if you had had 100 000 dollars in cash
[22:21.480 --> 22:25.160]  and 100 000 dollars in gold and silver back in 1913
[22:25.160 --> 22:29.080]  and kept them both until now your cash would actually have the buying power of
[22:29.080 --> 22:32.600]  only four thousand eight hundred dollars but your gold and silver would have the

[24:07.560 --> 24:11.560]  okay let's play the second half of my rt interview yesterday
[24:11.560 --> 24:15.720]  where they go to a news package about anti-terror cameras
[24:15.720 --> 24:19.160]  analyzing your behavior this is literal pre-crime
[24:19.160 --> 24:23.800]  thought crime then we'll come back in the next segment i'll continue to analyze
[24:23.800 --> 24:26.840]  how they're now going to roll out with cameras in your cars
[24:26.840 --> 24:31.400]  with audio watching everything you do here it is and then rt's Laura Emmett has
[24:31.400 --> 24:36.200]  the latest off for a week in the sun but if a
[24:36.200 --> 24:39.960]  european union project goes ahead these people could have their
[24:39.960 --> 24:43.720]  conversations and movements monitored while they're flying
[24:43.720 --> 24:46.840]  the plan has alarmed civil liberties campaigners
[24:46.840 --> 24:50.040]  who fear further growth in the surveillance state
[24:50.040 --> 24:53.560]  but air passengers are divided yeah i think that's bad
[24:53.560 --> 24:56.680]  just because it's like private and personal you wouldn't i don't know there's
[24:56.680 --> 24:59.480]  i think there's a line and we keep pushing it and pushing it with like the
[24:59.480 --> 25:02.840]  regulations and i think it's so prevalent already
[25:02.840 --> 25:07.240]  and with this expected you watch tv on land you watch tv in the air
[25:07.240 --> 25:10.600]  you'll be surveilled on land you'll be surveilled in the air doesn't worry me
[25:10.600 --> 25:14.440]  i forgot i've got nothing to hide so it wouldn't worry me personally
[25:14.440 --> 25:19.320]  the eu project is aimed at tackling terrorism by analyzing the way passengers
[25:19.320 --> 25:23.560]  behave in a bid to isolate potential bombers or hijackers when they're
[25:23.560 --> 25:26.920]  already on board at the moment surveillance on planes is
[25:26.920 --> 25:30.840]  mainly limited to a cctv camera near the cockpit
[25:30.840 --> 25:36.120]  britains are the most watched people in the world with more cctv cameras per
[25:36.120 --> 25:42.040]  capita than any other nation there are cameras on motorways in train stations
[25:42.040 --> 25:45.560]  and in airports and it's here at the university of redding
[25:45.560 --> 25:49.400]  that the new in-flight surveillance systems being developed
[25:49.400 --> 25:52.920]  it won't just include cameras there'll also be microphones
[25:52.920 --> 25:57.960]  and special systems for monitoring unusual behavior behavior the system will
[25:57.960 --> 26:01.000]  eventually be able to pick up includes sweating
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.800]  moving around the cabin in an erratic way and repeated visits to the toilet
[26:05.800 --> 26:10.520]  dr james ferriman insists it will distinguish between potential terrorists
[26:10.520 --> 26:14.680]  and nervous flyers now one way we could do that is to look very carefully
[26:14.680 --> 26:18.600]  at the types of cues that we detect so for example someone may be acting
[26:18.600 --> 26:22.680]  nervously or anxiously perhaps sweating in isolation
[26:22.680 --> 26:26.040]  of course that doesn't say anything it could be just again a nervous flyer
[26:26.040 --> 26:29.800]  but it could be a terrorist but we only know that when we combine this
[26:29.800 --> 26:32.680]  information with other sources of information that come to
[26:32.680 --> 26:36.280]  place i'd like to think of it as not big brother watching you but big brother
[26:36.280 --> 26:40.040]  looking after you not everyone sees it that way
[26:40.040 --> 26:44.040]  campaigners say privacy is one of the litmus tests for a democracy
[26:44.040 --> 26:47.640]  and mass surveillance erodes it enormously it treats
[26:47.640 --> 26:51.320]  everyone of us suspects and that completely contradicts
[26:51.320 --> 26:55.880]  whether the main tenets of democratic law which is that everyone is
[26:55.880 --> 26:58.840]  innocent until they are proven to be guilty
[26:58.840 --> 27:04.120]  continuing surveillance mass surveillance video communications
[27:04.120 --> 27:08.040]  uh whatever the many ways that seem to just be creeping forward
[27:08.040 --> 27:12.440]  completely goes against that and completely is a form
[27:12.440 --> 27:16.120]  a democracy apart from the civil rights issues
[27:16.120 --> 27:19.560]  many question the efficacy of an on-board system
[27:19.560 --> 27:23.800]  if a terrorist isn't caught at the airport they say by the time a plane's
[27:23.800 --> 27:27.720]  30 000 feet up isn't it already too late
[27:27.720 --> 27:33.640]  laura emet rt london that was laura rts laura emet but i want to bring alex
[27:33.640 --> 27:37.400]  back into this conversation so you heard one guy say in that in that story
[27:37.400 --> 27:40.520]  big brother's not watching you big brother's looking after you what do you
[27:40.520 --> 27:43.960]  make about the surveillance now in the air
[27:43.960 --> 27:48.440]  well in 1984 big brother was helping you i mean big brother didn't come out and
[27:48.440 --> 27:52.120]  say we're oppressing you this is the scientific dictatorship
[27:52.120 --> 27:55.480]  they're training everyone to have everything you do recorded
[27:55.480 --> 27:58.360]  12 years ago they put microphones up around austin
[27:58.360 --> 28:01.880]  where i live and said oh they're gunshot detectors now they admit it's to
[28:01.880 --> 28:05.160]  surveillance uh the the naked body scanners are really
[28:05.160 --> 28:08.920]  to get a 360 body scan so passive cameras can look through your
[28:08.920 --> 28:11.720]  clothes on the street and get your identity they bathe you in
[28:11.720 --> 28:15.560]  radiation they now admit in the u.s they're saving all the images
[28:15.560 --> 28:19.240]  and they lied to the public the terrorist is the military industrial
[28:19.240 --> 28:23.800]  complex that is making us the enemy and and making profits
[28:23.800 --> 28:27.000]  out of this and it's total quackery a thought crime
[28:27.000 --> 28:30.600]  where they say these cameras will analyze that you're sweating maybe you're
[28:30.600 --> 28:33.880]  hot maybe you've got an upset stomach the point is
[28:33.880 --> 28:38.200]  is that this is all aimed at free humanity it has nothing to do
[28:38.200 --> 28:41.240]  with men from central asia that are really funded
[28:41.240 --> 28:45.640]  by the cia and google and others are a big part
[28:45.640 --> 28:48.920]  of the face scanning cameras going in on the streets and all the surveillance
[28:48.920 --> 28:53.320]  this is worse than 1984 alex unfortunately crime
[28:53.320 --> 28:57.480]  unfortunately it's sure we're coming to an end but it's always great to have you
[28:57.480 --> 28:59.640]  on we hope to check out your website hopefully it's
[28:59.640 --> 29:03.160]  back and running that was alex radio host alex jones
[29:03.160 --> 29:07.080]  all right now you heard that woman in the piece well i have nothing to hide
[29:07.080 --> 29:11.320]  record me record the audio well then how about a camera in your house
[29:11.320 --> 29:14.280]  how about a camera in the bathroom how about a camera in your shower
[29:14.280 --> 29:17.160]  you're already letting them naked body scan you at the airport
[29:17.160 --> 29:21.480]  they're training us in the airports and on the planes for what they plan to go
[29:21.480 --> 29:24.840]  mainline in the streets at the courthouses
[29:24.840 --> 29:29.480]  with mobile vans with cameras on the street that scan through your clothes
[29:29.480 --> 29:34.520]  we told you this years ago now it's all being announced
[29:34.520 --> 29:38.200]  they are training us to live under total surveillance
[29:38.200 --> 29:42.520]  worse than 1984 and and the one individual who was against it all in the
[29:42.520 --> 29:45.880]  piece says this is creeping surveillance it isn't creeping
[29:45.880 --> 29:50.760]  it's racing it's galloping it's it's going at light speed
[29:50.760 --> 30:00.040]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[30:00.040 --> 30:03.240]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[30:03.240 --> 30:07.240]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[30:07.240 --> 30:11.000]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[30:11.000 --> 30:14.680]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[30:14.680 --> 30:18.840]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[30:18.840 --> 30:22.040]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[30:22.040 --> 30:24.680]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[30:24.680 --> 30:28.600]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[30:28.600 --> 30:32.120]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids

[33:10.360 --> 33:13.880]  in the heart of the resistance you're listening to the
[33:13.880 --> 33:20.440]  alex jones show so 10 12 years ago i would read mit
[33:20.440 --> 33:25.160]  pentagon documents e u documents where they plan to put cameras in all cars
[33:25.160 --> 33:28.200]  to watch you in real time they even talked about how they would sell it
[33:28.200 --> 33:32.200]  saying well 30 plus children in the u.s die every year on average
[33:32.200 --> 33:35.640]  when they're left in hot cars so we'll punish everyone
[33:35.640 --> 33:39.320]  and we'll put pressure sensors in the front and back seats that if the
[33:39.320 --> 33:44.120]  temperature goes above 100 degrees the camera will turn on and call police
[33:44.120 --> 33:48.280]  and give them an image of whoever's in the car well you go open your car
[33:48.280 --> 33:52.520]  in the summer it's 100 degrees getting there turning the a c on it turns on
[33:52.520 --> 33:56.360]  they admittedly as we told you many years before they came out and
[33:56.360 --> 33:59.800]  told the public that they were using on star to dial in without warrants and
[33:59.800 --> 34:03.480]  listen to you all of this is admittedly
[34:03.480 --> 34:07.880]  designed to surveil everything you're doing remember five years ago
[34:07.880 --> 34:11.880]  google came out and announced a patent and then
[34:11.880 --> 34:15.560]  yahoo was also in the news saying well we've got a patent too
[34:15.560 --> 34:20.920]  and we're going to deploy this and uh it uses the microphones and cameras that
[34:20.920 --> 34:24.840]  are in all the new computers but five years ago they were being phased in then
[34:24.840 --> 34:27.880]  and they said don't worry humans aren't going to watch and listen to you a
[34:27.880 --> 34:31.000]  computer if it hears a dog barking or it will listen
[34:31.000 --> 34:34.600]  to what tv show you're watching it will then know what ads to tailor
[34:34.600 --> 34:38.600]  and have pop up now now that's their cover of course they'll then
[34:38.600 --> 34:41.880]  make profits out of their surveillance that's one side of it
[34:41.880 --> 34:46.840]  but the real main overarching reason they're doing this is to track
[34:46.840 --> 34:50.840]  everything you're really saying and doing to be able to gauge you as an enemy
[34:50.840 --> 34:54.280]  to understand how to propagandize you to know what you're really saying in your
[34:54.280 --> 34:57.080]  home you are being listened to illegally
[34:57.080 --> 35:00.840]  you are being tracked and now schmidt the head of google is in the news
[35:00.840 --> 35:03.720]  every two or three days saying everything you do will be
[35:03.720 --> 35:08.920]  surveilled there is no anonymity there is no privacy uh you're stupid you
[35:08.920 --> 35:12.040]  don't know how to handle it this is just the way it is we're going to do
[35:12.040 --> 35:15.960]  whatever we want and yes we work for the nsa and cia and
[35:15.960 --> 35:19.720]  yes we're tracking everything and yes we've got white vans worldwide
[35:19.720 --> 35:22.600]  not just photographing and videotaping your house and your street
[35:22.600 --> 35:26.120]  but we're grabbing all of your wireless transmissions illegally
[35:26.120 --> 35:29.080]  and we're just going to do it and we're going to start taking over the web and
[35:29.080 --> 35:34.440]  shutting off what websites you can see and that's just what we're going to do
[35:35.080 --> 35:38.280]  he was in the news yesterday saying things like this the head of facebook
[35:38.280 --> 35:42.760]  calls you dumb efforts that you trust him he's selling all your data
[35:42.760 --> 35:46.680]  ha ha ha you thought your private pages were private they've now made all that
[35:46.680 --> 35:50.920]  public ha ha ha they're selling it all ha ha ha
[35:50.920 --> 35:56.280]  twitter's run by the cia and state department ha ha ha
[35:56.280 --> 36:01.480]  they're just doing it and here's the crème de la crème or the coup de
[36:01.480 --> 36:06.280]  gras the the ultimate expression of it
[36:06.280 --> 36:10.120]  homeland security three years ago had meetings and said they they want to
[36:10.120 --> 36:13.000]  deploy until there was a public outcry that
[36:13.000 --> 36:17.400]  everyone when you go to the airport they go here is your taser bracelet
[36:17.400 --> 36:23.640]  that will deliver 50 000 volts uh into your arm and everyone will wear it and
[36:23.640 --> 36:26.840]  they even cut to people on the street saying i think it's great it will stop
[36:26.840 --> 36:31.800]  al-qaeda the non-existent made-up pentagon boogie man
[36:31.800 --> 36:35.560]  and so that's the final expression is like i guess like the running man you're
[36:35.560 --> 36:39.720]  all wearing a taser bracelet or i guess an explosive necklace around your neck
[36:39.720 --> 36:43.880]  that blows your head off if the government decides that you're a threat
[36:43.880 --> 36:49.720]  so the government and global corporations they're more secretive than ever
[36:49.720 --> 36:53.240]  they obsess over the public not knowing anything they're doing
[36:53.240 --> 36:59.080]  they're offshore they're above the law they write the laws where they're exempt
[36:59.080 --> 37:03.720]  but you have no privacy you have no rights and
[37:03.720 --> 37:07.720]  all the military deployed at public places and landmarks in the last seven
[37:07.720 --> 37:11.000]  eight years nine years now coming up on 9 11 anniversary
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.960]  all of the militarization of police all of the intimidation all of the
[37:15.960 --> 37:19.640]  checkpoints and the blood draw checkpoints all of it
[37:19.640 --> 37:27.320]  is to buffalo you and to dominate you into full submission to them
[37:27.320 --> 37:31.080]  just completely giving up and letting the system get away with it and
[37:31.080 --> 37:36.040]  acclimating the public the police the courts the enforcers the media
[37:36.040 --> 37:40.360]  the government people to accept something more orwellian
[37:40.360 --> 37:45.800]  than 1984 and oh we're going to drug your water and oh we're going to give you
[37:45.800 --> 37:48.600]  vaccines to make you happy you'll never be upset again
[37:48.600 --> 37:52.200]  and oh we're are putting flour out in the water to make you submit
[37:52.200 --> 37:55.720]  it wasn't just for your teeth haha and yeah
[37:55.720 --> 37:59.160]  you know girls are going into puberty at three four five six years old
[37:59.160 --> 38:03.480]  yeah the bicephene all a gives you cancer we don't care it makes you submit
[38:03.480 --> 38:09.400]  it makes boys infertile and fries women isn't it great we're just going to do it
[38:09.400 --> 38:12.440]  and then we have this eight minute clip of c span
[38:12.440 --> 38:15.640]  with one of the former heads of counterterrorism on from the bush
[38:15.640 --> 38:20.680]  administration and every caller called in plugging info wars com
[38:20.680 --> 38:24.360]  talking about all these top generals and people saying 9 11's an inside job or
[38:24.360 --> 38:27.000]  how building seven wasn't hit by a plane and
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.880]  it's on video that they said get back we're blowing it up
[38:29.880 --> 38:33.720]  and the the or how six of the 10 commissioners and three of the lawyers
[38:33.720 --> 38:38.680]  say it's a criminal cover-up and a lie and he would just say conspiracy theory
[38:38.680 --> 38:41.880]  and the host would say oh more conspiracy theorist
[38:41.880 --> 38:46.360]  just a nice easy one liner for the public sit down
[38:46.360 --> 38:53.320]  shut up and take it and so here it is from cryptome
[38:53.320 --> 38:57.560]  but then they excise a piece of cbs news
[38:57.560 --> 39:00.760]  lawmakers are considering controversial new legislation this week
[39:00.760 --> 39:03.880]  that would allow vehicles to be equipped with dashboard cameras to record the
[39:03.880 --> 39:07.880]  movements leading up to accidents that propose law
[39:07.880 --> 39:12.760]  ab1942 would promote safer driving habits and reduce accidents by
[39:12.760 --> 39:15.800]  permitting video recorders to be installed on the windshield
[39:15.800 --> 39:19.960]  the bill currently allows devices to record video audio how fast
[39:19.960 --> 39:23.320]  and which direction the vehicle is traveling a history of where your car
[39:23.320 --> 39:26.520]  has been steering and brake performance that's in the black box
[39:26.520 --> 39:30.600]  and seatbelt usage proponents say there are enough measures to avoid an
[39:30.600 --> 39:33.080]  invasion of privacy but others call the proposal a huge
[39:33.080 --> 39:38.040]  overreach of government power and it wires into that cell
[39:38.040 --> 39:42.680]  phone that's in the dash that wires it all back to the
[39:42.680 --> 39:47.080]  commissariat back to the nkvd back to homeland
[39:47.080 --> 39:50.200]  security so they're just coming out with all of it now
[39:50.200 --> 39:54.680]  flaunting it in our faces they could care less what we think about it
[39:54.680 --> 39:57.800]  they could care and and they're just attempting to dominate us
[39:57.800 --> 40:01.400]  yeah we're saving the naked body scans yeah we've been taking your baby's blood
[40:01.400 --> 40:03.800]  and giving it to the pentagon secretly for 38 years
[40:03.800 --> 40:07.880]  and we lied to you and said it was a blood test yeah we called people that
[40:07.880 --> 40:10.520]  exposed this conspiracy theorist but it's all true

[49:15.160 --> 49:19.800]  or posing at the uh at the deli window you think
[49:19.800 --> 49:22.360]  you had 90 percent that were self-sufficient in the 10 years of
[49:22.360 --> 49:26.520]  the depression and seven million starved to death now you got 95 percent
[49:26.520 --> 49:29.880]  that aren't self-sufficient 90 percent that are urban of the 10 percent that
[49:29.880 --> 49:33.080]  are rural only half or five percent in the aggregate
[49:33.080 --> 49:36.360]  are self-sufficient what do you think is going to happen to those of us that are
[49:36.360 --> 49:40.200]  self-sufficient you think the cops and all the bureaucrats
[49:40.200 --> 49:43.480]  and all the welfare people and all the big fat cat bankers
[49:43.480 --> 49:46.760]  why do you think government's arming itself and hardening all its positions
[49:46.760 --> 49:50.680]  and putting up constantina wire and training for riots against this
[49:50.680 --> 49:54.600]  they stole everything and they set this up like a house of cards to fall right
[49:54.600 --> 49:57.320]  into their hands and now they're getting ready to
[49:57.320 --> 50:02.040]  rape america and then slit america's throat and throw us in a ditch
[50:02.040 --> 50:06.600]  but the good news is the people are waking up the police are waking up the
[50:06.600 --> 50:09.720]  military are waking up but waking up in enough
[50:09.720 --> 50:13.560]  once they fully put us into cardiac financial and societal
[50:13.560 --> 50:18.440]  arrest once we fully collapse it won't matter if you know the truth
[50:18.440 --> 50:21.000]  you're going to have to make the decisions about submitting to the
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.760]  globalist and being killed slowly or saying no
[50:24.760 --> 50:28.520]  and taking all the pain up front but there's an old saying
[50:28.520 --> 50:32.680]  pain is weakness leaving the body what did victor hugo say
[50:32.680 --> 50:39.320]  adversity makes men what's the quote adversity makes men
[50:39.320 --> 50:46.840]  and plenty makes monsters well you're going to get tested now

[1:00:55.880 --> 1:01:00.040]  that the system is capitulating to the truth
[1:01:00.040 --> 1:01:02.920]  because a lot of people at high levels are realizing
[1:01:02.920 --> 1:01:06.200]  they are in the crosshairs as well and that's the key
[1:01:06.200 --> 1:01:09.960]  coming up super bug that is resistant to most powerful antibiotics has reached the

[1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:39.400]  and i have a question i was hoping you can also
[1:01:39.400 --> 1:01:42.360]  ask alan watt or when he comes on the air
[1:01:42.360 --> 1:01:47.080]  um you know i've done research uh as far as you know the new world order
[1:01:47.080 --> 1:01:51.560]  um you know and it leads me to you know the the trial at all commission and it
[1:01:51.560 --> 1:01:54.840]  leads me to the builder group then it leads me to the Illuminati then it
[1:01:54.840 --> 1:01:58.840]  leads me to the Jesuits so forth and so on i'm just kind of wondering
[1:01:58.840 --> 1:02:03.480]  a what is the definition of the rabbit hole and b
[1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:07.720]  who do you think is at the end of that rabbit hole the the the driving force
[1:02:07.720 --> 1:02:11.880]  behind this whole uh because you said yourself it's been going on in history
[1:02:11.880 --> 1:02:15.320]  and uh so i'm wondering what is that driving force that keeps
[1:02:15.320 --> 1:02:19.880]  perpetuating the okay now it's i mean it's an excellent question if you look
[1:02:19.880 --> 1:02:23.240]  and we'll ask alan that question coming up but i know what he's going to say
[1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:27.240]  the priest class of egypt and babelon greece
[1:02:27.240 --> 1:02:32.440]  cissara three thousand years ago you could even say six thousand but but
[1:02:32.440 --> 1:02:36.360]  predominantly these these these guilds of psychology
[1:02:36.360 --> 1:02:39.720]  they didn't call it that but but how to control populations
[1:02:39.720 --> 1:02:43.160]  how to manipulate populations started with witch doctors
[1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:46.360]  they'd learn how they could go to the hills and dig out phosphorus they didn't
[1:02:46.360 --> 1:02:50.360]  know what it was uh and or how they could dig out
[1:02:50.360 --> 1:02:54.440]  uh sulfur and form it into a little idle
[1:02:54.440 --> 1:02:58.520]  and then say za booby and throw it into a fire
[1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:01.560]  and then it would explode with blue and red and green colors
[1:03:01.560 --> 1:03:04.920]  and they could mix copper in to make it glow green or they could say the green
[1:03:04.920 --> 1:03:08.520]  god it would burn green and they how does the witch doctor do it here i mean
[1:03:08.520 --> 1:03:12.600]  you're talking 10 000 years ago uh or they could mix other chemicals in to
[1:03:12.600 --> 1:03:17.160]  make it burn red and they would say you know dragon god a zoomer
[1:03:17.160 --> 1:03:23.240]  and boom and oh and he'd say now you give me the best
[1:03:23.240 --> 1:03:27.400]  hot and the best women and the best servants and my family that
[1:03:27.400 --> 1:03:31.320]  or the or the rain god won't come and then as an act of submission the
[1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:35.000]  psychopathic con artist in history and that's what they are
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:38.680]  would say i demand your firstborn to be my servants
[1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:42.920]  and as a greater act of submission the rains will not come
[1:03:42.920 --> 1:03:48.360]  unless you give me a child to be sacrificed and i will eat the flesh
[1:03:48.360 --> 1:03:52.920]  every culture sacrifices children eats them in anthropology
[1:03:52.920 --> 1:03:56.760]  every culture gobbling children is it is a chief enjoyment
[1:03:56.760 --> 1:03:59.720]  this is what humans do when the psychopaths get control they always do
[1:03:59.720 --> 1:04:04.600]  now expanding on that uh if you go back
[1:04:04.600 --> 1:04:09.560]  into uh history uh the really dominant groups would then start demanding
[1:04:09.560 --> 1:04:14.840]  the chief's son or the king's son and and the priest class would use a drought
[1:04:14.840 --> 1:04:19.320]  or bad weather to really get control or an earthquake
[1:04:19.320 --> 1:04:23.640]  and they would come to the king and say you must give me your daughter
[1:04:23.640 --> 1:04:28.280]  to be thrown into the fires of mulich and uh
[1:04:28.280 --> 1:04:31.720]  they would do it as an act of mind control submission
[1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:35.480]  now we sacrifice at blood drawing checkpoints
[1:04:35.480 --> 1:04:38.760]  now we let the cps take our children as a sacrifice
[1:04:38.760 --> 1:04:42.520]  now we go through the naked body scanners and humiliated all
[1:04:42.520 --> 1:04:46.680]  so the control freak scum can feel powerful and control us
[1:04:46.680 --> 1:04:50.440]  key point adam stay there i'll let you have a counter back to what i said
[1:04:50.440 --> 1:04:56.040]  when we return on the other side what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole

[1:08:09.400 --> 1:08:13.480]  some man you just can't reach
[1:08:13.480 --> 1:08:18.760]  so you get what we had here last week which is the way he wants
[1:08:18.760 --> 1:08:22.040]  well he is

[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:34.040]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:41.400]  look at your young man fighting look at your women crying
[1:08:41.400 --> 1:08:45.000]  okay let's go back to adam adam if you just joined us and asked
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:48.760]  is it the illuminati is it the belterberg group is the trilateral commission
[1:08:48.760 --> 1:08:53.800]  who runs the planet and if you have to look at the physically who runs it it's
[1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:57.560]  the military of europe the united states and england
[1:08:57.560 --> 1:09:02.840]  but who owns it through fraud is six major private central banks
[1:09:02.840 --> 1:09:05.960]  and then if you look at the methodology of control
[1:09:05.960 --> 1:09:09.400]  the illuminati was just a Rothschild backed
[1:09:09.400 --> 1:09:14.120]  arm that wanted to overthrow the royals and before that you'd had
[1:09:14.120 --> 1:09:18.040]  henry the eighth fighting and and and wanting power not just over wanting to
[1:09:18.040 --> 1:09:21.720]  have a divorce but having his own control against the vatican
[1:09:21.720 --> 1:09:27.000]  so it's always the same systems of political and societal manipulation
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.880]  it's just different groups and different clubs
[1:09:29.880 --> 1:09:33.400]  that understand that science and are able to mass enough power
[1:09:33.400 --> 1:09:37.320]  to take over their region and the ultimate goal is a planetary
[1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:41.560]  regime to block out any future competition and to dominate
[1:09:41.560 --> 1:09:45.320]  the individual but really if you go back to greece
[1:09:45.320 --> 1:09:51.800]  and to egypt and to babalon three thousand plus years ago they all
[1:09:51.800 --> 1:09:56.840]  develop systems of social control you can go to peru and the nasga lines and
[1:09:56.840 --> 1:10:01.400]  see all the evidence of social control there public works projects making
[1:10:01.400 --> 1:10:04.040]  people build big temples for you it's it's slavery
[1:10:04.040 --> 1:10:08.680]  you got to do this or the rain god won't come and so it's that priest class
[1:10:08.680 --> 1:10:11.960]  that had really supplanted the ancient tribal class
[1:10:11.960 --> 1:10:15.320]  you'd be the tribal leader if you were the toughest the strongest the smartest
[1:10:15.320 --> 1:10:19.080]  had the best sixth sense could lead your tribe to the best hunting grounds
[1:10:19.080 --> 1:10:21.960]  if you go back to the earliest societies worldwide
[1:10:21.960 --> 1:10:26.600]  you see them being supplanted by the scientific class which is really the
[1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:30.280]  witch doctor class who mixed religion with mumbo jumbo and science
[1:10:30.280 --> 1:10:34.440]  early sciences and impressing people with understanding
[1:10:34.440 --> 1:10:38.120]  you know that there will be an eclipse on this date and saying the snake god is
[1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:41.480]  going to eat the moon or eat the sun today and if you don't give me
[1:10:41.480 --> 1:10:45.400]  one thousand sacrifices the snake god won't regurgitate
[1:10:45.400 --> 1:10:48.760]  the sun back and so everybody starts screaming and crying during the eclipse
[1:10:48.760 --> 1:10:51.720]  they're chopping hearts out in mexico city
[1:10:51.720 --> 1:10:54.680]  and basically everywhere else where they're having eclipses as fast as they
[1:10:54.680 --> 1:10:57.560]  can go and is this going to make it come back is this going to make the snake god
[1:10:57.560 --> 1:11:01.000]  not not kill us and they're just like give me more give me more
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:04.120]  and the main way the priest in mesoamerica made money was in the meat
[1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:07.720]  markets they own the meat from the dead women and
[1:11:07.720 --> 1:11:11.480]  children and and others and then they made the profit from the
[1:11:11.480 --> 1:11:15.400]  main meat source being humans so that's just government it
[1:11:15.400 --> 1:11:19.320]  government normally ends up being a bunch of psychopaths on power trips
[1:11:19.320 --> 1:11:23.480]  eating people the the worst expression of humanity
[1:11:23.480 --> 1:11:26.840]  always takes control in a more modern sense hitler would just launch more
[1:11:26.840 --> 1:11:30.760]  wars and would just love the images of burning cities
[1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:35.080]  psychopaths enjoy it they enjoy controlling the arts and literature
[1:11:35.080 --> 1:11:38.760]  and culture and being able to dominate and and control everyone
[1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:42.120]  but adam if you look at the trilateral commission cfr roach of
[1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:45.960]  international affairs club of rome bill berger
[1:11:45.960 --> 1:11:49.320]  they politically it's less than 200 people that share
[1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:53.080]  and run all of those organizations and they all put out the same white papers
[1:11:53.080 --> 1:11:56.280]  in the same direction eugenics world government
[1:11:56.280 --> 1:12:00.840]  total control their crimes legalized regular activity criminalized
[1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:04.600]  they use the law to suppress their enemies to create monopolies
[1:12:04.600 --> 1:12:08.760]  but then when you look at what they do in their off time at bohemian grove in
[1:12:08.760 --> 1:12:12.840]  california or at groves in germany uh or you look at france
[1:12:12.840 --> 1:12:17.640]  swamina raw publicly worshiping lucifer uh in mainstream news or
[1:12:17.640 --> 1:12:22.840]  tony blair doing it in mainstream news and being at seances and rituals and
[1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:25.880]  they're there they're a bunch of lunatics and at the bottom of the
[1:12:25.880 --> 1:12:28.680]  rabbit hole they believe they're worshiping lucifer
[1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:32.280]  uh so they're not a very nice group of people but i hope that answers your
[1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:34.680]  question adam because it's a very important question
[1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:38.760]  yeah i know you've been very helpful and i agree with everything that you said
[1:12:38.760 --> 1:12:41.880]  you hit a really key point though that it's lucifer
[1:12:41.880 --> 1:12:45.880]  uh the rabbit hole of course is the journey to search for the truth
[1:12:45.880 --> 1:12:49.080]  and once you get down to the bottom of that rabbit hole you realize that all
[1:12:49.080 --> 1:12:54.360]  these people are luciferian worshiping uh
[1:12:54.360 --> 1:12:58.280]  saying this and that's a hundred percent fact adam even if an atheist or
[1:12:58.280 --> 1:13:01.720]  agnostic doesn't believe that there's a guy in red pajamas
[1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:07.480]  the point is the elite believe they worship a earth creature a a sky god
[1:13:07.480 --> 1:13:11.880]  that needs blood and death and destruction and they think it's wonderful
[1:13:11.880 --> 1:13:15.720]  to kill people you know they think things like you know let's pull up some of
[1:13:15.720 --> 1:13:19.960]  geiger's artwork uh you know just type in geiger alien because
[1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:23.160]  that's what he's most famous for and the elites i mean i've studied
[1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:26.680]  schwarzenegger and he owns a bunch of this artwork and even more sickening
[1:13:26.680 --> 1:13:31.240]  german artwork where it's dead babies and Nazi uniforms and maggots on dead
[1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:34.600]  children and they just and and and they think it's
[1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:38.440]  beautiful and you know i look at it and you know it's it's upsetting and
[1:13:38.440 --> 1:13:41.800]  disquieting but for them it's oh how beautiful and a lot of it's
[1:13:41.800 --> 1:13:46.600]  homoerotic in fact watch what you show because that's not homoerotic but it's
[1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:51.160]  got a lot of demons raping women and children and and and death and
[1:13:51.160 --> 1:13:56.600]  giant piles of mutated and and and bio engineering merging with technology
[1:13:56.600 --> 1:14:01.400]  and it's just i mean at that you know they'll always tell you there is no
[1:14:01.400 --> 1:14:04.520]  god there is no religion you know because they want you blind to that
[1:14:04.520 --> 1:14:08.840]  meanwhile they're just reveling in evil
[1:14:08.840 --> 1:14:13.720]  anything else uh adam yeah i know that that that's about sums it up and and
[1:14:13.720 --> 1:14:16.760]  again uh you know it's kind of funny because these
[1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:19.720]  elitists i think that they're going to get like eternal life or whatever or
[1:14:19.720 --> 1:14:23.640]  whatever that they're falsely promised by this master of deception
[1:14:23.640 --> 1:14:27.320]  um you know they're they're they're not going to get the last laugh because you
[1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:30.520]  know what they're expendable just like everybody else in history that try to
[1:14:30.520 --> 1:14:34.600]  do satan's work so uh well said adam austin in florida you're on the
[1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:40.360]  year so hey i got two points elix um
[1:14:40.360 --> 1:14:43.640]  let's see uh i just want to start out kind of saying um i guess i'm kind of
[1:14:43.640 --> 1:14:47.720]  one of the rare ones who's actually been blessed with uh knowledge
[1:14:47.720 --> 1:14:51.320]  you know of living on a farm and kind of being like self-sufficient you're an
[1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:55.480]  al-qaeda member mm-hmm no no just an american kid
[1:14:55.480 --> 1:14:58.920]  no but i mean that's everything's pointed at you you are what when they say
[1:14:58.920 --> 1:15:01.720]  al-qaeda they're talking about you so you're al-qaeda go ahead
[1:15:01.720 --> 1:15:06.120]  or well also and i got really um i've been wanting to call and tell you about
[1:15:06.120 --> 1:15:08.920]  this for a while it's really interesting is about george bush
[1:15:08.920 --> 1:15:13.160]  and uh i know back in the 90s he owned the texas rangers
[1:15:13.160 --> 1:15:18.360]  baseball team yes well they uh do spring training down here close to my town
[1:15:18.360 --> 1:15:22.600]  i'm basically in sarasota and uh i just thought put some connections
[1:15:22.600 --> 1:15:24.920]  together i thought it was really interesting how
[1:15:24.920 --> 1:15:30.040]  jeb bush was the governor of florida uh bush was in sarasota when nine 11
[1:15:30.040 --> 1:15:33.880]  happened um you know and and then the whole
[1:15:33.880 --> 1:15:38.280]  drug thing you know our county at one point was uh one of the bigger drug
[1:15:38.280 --> 1:15:43.320]  counties in the 90s i guess but uh yeah i just kind of put all that together and
[1:15:43.320 --> 1:15:46.520]  kind of figured you know maybe what the connection might be with
[1:15:46.520 --> 1:15:51.000]  florida down here well you know what the connection is massive narcotics
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:54.920]  trafficking uh whore running uh just mafia
[1:15:54.920 --> 1:15:58.760]  territories that's why the government's promoting legalization and prostitution
[1:15:58.760 --> 1:16:02.600]  and gambling everywhere because they want to tax it and get their cut
[1:16:02.600 --> 1:16:06.440]  yeah well i i also thought it was really interesting because um in oh four we went
[1:16:06.440 --> 1:16:10.520]  through a category four hurricane and i basically kind of got a glimpse of what
[1:16:10.520 --> 1:16:14.760]  it's like to live in you know martial law scenario i mean bags of eyes for
[1:16:14.760 --> 1:16:19.000]  like 10 like eight or 10 bucks you know nobody was prepared or had any food
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:22.600]  stored so everybody's fridge was off and everybody kind of
[1:16:22.600 --> 1:16:26.920]  didn't know what to do there was like what do we do so um national guard came
[1:16:26.920 --> 1:16:30.520]  you know and within two or three days bush came to our town and i was like i
[1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:34.520]  thought it's funny because he didn't go to katrina for like a long time
[1:16:34.520 --> 1:16:38.360]  and i was like well that was kind of odd
[1:16:38.360 --> 1:16:41.400]  austin i appreciate your call good to have you on board
[1:16:41.400 --> 1:16:45.000]  ruth and louisiana you're on the air go ahead ruth
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:51.480]  yes hello alex welcome oh i always have you in my prayers in your family i need
[1:16:51.480 --> 1:16:54.760]  that i need that i need that shield please keep it up ruth
[1:16:54.760 --> 1:17:01.080]  yeah definitely for sure look i want to bring out an alternative to baby formula
[1:17:01.080 --> 1:17:04.440]  which is goat's milk why would you want an alternative it's making the girls go
[1:17:04.440 --> 1:17:07.000]  into puberty at three and four years of age
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  it's it's causing their brain to be on average 20 uh percentage points smaller
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:15.640]  and that's loving well case and point on all of this
[1:17:15.640 --> 1:17:21.000]  my mother was an anesthetist okay and when i had my first son i could not
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:25.640]  produce enough breast milk so i tried all the formulas on the shelf
[1:17:25.640 --> 1:17:28.920]  he threw it all up he couldn't keep none of it down
[1:17:28.920 --> 1:17:34.280]  my mother was down and she says look we need to find some goat's milk
[1:17:34.280 --> 1:17:38.920]  she says because in the old days when she was raised on form that's what they
[1:17:38.920 --> 1:17:42.120]  used and of course the molecular structure of
[1:17:42.120 --> 1:17:46.600]  the milk is much smaller it's easier to digest
[1:17:46.600 --> 1:17:51.320]  so at first the doctor wanted to do a bunch of tests so i said okay i'm gonna
[1:17:51.320 --> 1:17:55.800]  try this first uh it took me a while to try to find some
[1:17:55.800 --> 1:17:59.080]  i wasn't able to find the fresh goat's milk which is better
[1:17:59.080 --> 1:18:02.600]  but i was able to find some canned goat's milk so
[1:18:02.600 --> 1:18:07.080]  i tried it my son didn't throw any of it up
[1:18:07.080 --> 1:18:13.160]  he loved it of course she was from my nutrition was from india so she well
[1:18:13.160 --> 1:18:18.120]  no i mean history a lot of women a lot a small percentage but overall a lot of
[1:18:18.120 --> 1:18:21.000]  women uh can't produce milk or have problems or
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:23.880]  sometimes their babies are allergic to it very rarely
[1:18:23.880 --> 1:18:27.800]  and goat's milk is good uh there's almost no rejection known for
[1:18:27.800 --> 1:18:31.880]  ass milk uh donkey milk uh from the female donkey
[1:18:31.880 --> 1:18:35.080]  and and so that's some of the best milk you can get for humans
[1:18:35.080 --> 1:18:38.360]  uh if you can't get to you know a regular human milk
[1:18:38.360 --> 1:18:41.240]  but it's a conspiracy theory that women should breastfeed i mean everybody
[1:18:41.240 --> 1:18:44.760]  knows that that that that was a conspiracy theory and that the
[1:18:44.760 --> 1:18:47.960]  family never existed and that and that and that children
[1:18:47.960 --> 1:18:52.680]  need melamine filled bisphenol a milk uh here's a headline tainted
[1:18:52.680 --> 1:18:56.280]  chinese baby milk powder causes baby girls to grow breast health
[1:18:56.280 --> 1:18:58.680]  authorities in china have ordered an investigation
[1:18:58.680 --> 1:19:01.880]  into a batch of powdered baby milk that caused children as young as four months
[1:19:01.880 --> 1:19:04.360]  to grow breast and they just admit now that that's
[1:19:04.360 --> 1:19:07.640]  happening here but they say that's fine
[1:19:07.640 --> 1:19:14.520]  and in in back in the day you know it was the formula was probably a little
[1:19:14.520 --> 1:19:18.520]  bit better than it is today that was back in the al-qaeda that was back when
[1:19:18.520 --> 1:19:22.600]  americans were al-qaeda now they know it's good to give them formula do not
[1:19:22.600 --> 1:19:29.400]  breastfeed that is evil yeah i mean it's it's a shame of course of course i'm
[1:19:29.400 --> 1:19:33.880]  being sarcastic ruth god bless you ruth and i need those prayers thank you
[1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:38.760]  yeah uh women look if you're gonna have children it's the most
[1:19:38.760 --> 1:19:41.800]  precious thing in the world have your husband work a couple extra jobs if you
[1:19:41.800 --> 1:19:44.520]  have to give them at least six months of breast milk
[1:19:44.520 --> 1:19:48.440]  come on i know it's a conspiracy theory to say your baby needs it but you've
[1:19:48.440 --> 1:19:53.080]  got those mammary glands for a reason okay and your baby's gonna take to that
[1:19:53.080 --> 1:19:56.920]  milk like a fish to water or you can give them bisphenol a laced milk

[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:06.120]  up uh the fortune 100 and they all cross chair
[1:38:06.120 --> 1:38:09.320]  sometimes on hundreds of boards all these other organizations
[1:38:09.320 --> 1:38:12.760]  they all push for the same thing global governance tyranny
[1:38:12.760 --> 1:38:15.960]  but but i thought we'd get you to talk about that structure that that
[1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:20.360]  architecture from your perspective but also the different cultures and ideas
[1:38:20.360 --> 1:38:23.320]  that fed into it uh and of course i call it the priest
[1:38:23.320 --> 1:38:25.880]  class because that's what they call it themselves
[1:38:25.880 --> 1:38:29.400]  and and and what the illuminati is you've got the floor
[1:38:29.400 --> 1:38:31.960]  i'm gonna try to not interrupt even though it's always thought-provoking
[1:38:31.960 --> 1:38:34.840]  spend five minutes or so breaking down its history
[1:38:34.840 --> 1:38:39.320]  who they are uh their modes of control and where they're taking us if we don't
[1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:43.800]  block them well basically it's a system and that's
[1:38:43.800 --> 1:38:48.760]  what it's a system and the philosophy which is also a religion
[1:38:48.760 --> 1:38:53.480]  with its own belief system uh that really has been around since
[1:38:53.480 --> 1:38:58.600]  commerce began organized commerce and organized commerce
[1:38:58.600 --> 1:39:03.640]  we don't even know how old it is we have uh the ancient traders of the
[1:39:03.640 --> 1:39:07.800]  the beaten dug up sumer for instance and found out there's another group
[1:39:07.800 --> 1:39:12.440]  pre-existed sumer who were into trading uh they lived very well we know that
[1:39:12.440 --> 1:39:16.440]  from their indoor plumbing and stuff like that thousands of years ago
[1:39:16.440 --> 1:39:19.640]  and they had the trade routes all the way to china right through the middle east
[1:39:19.640 --> 1:39:23.960]  in asia so trading is the key to it because along
[1:39:23.960 --> 1:39:29.400]  with trading comes something called money and it's different from barter
[1:39:29.400 --> 1:39:33.960]  where you where two people can literally argue over the price of a sack of potatoes
[1:39:33.960 --> 1:39:38.520]  versus a sack of oatmeal once you get a third party coming in with
[1:39:38.520 --> 1:39:43.960]  money uh then then you're under their directives because
[1:39:43.960 --> 1:39:47.880]  they can basically decide how much that money is worth today or tomorrow
[1:39:47.880 --> 1:39:52.200]  or devalue it or whatever and the ancient traders we do know that's from the
[1:39:52.200 --> 1:39:57.800]  Phoenicians for instance that they had um they had to not only trade with
[1:39:57.800 --> 1:40:01.560]  people but they had to and it was seafarers as
[1:40:01.560 --> 1:40:06.360]  well with a huge navy to trade but they had to also get all
[1:40:06.360 --> 1:40:10.360]  these different cultures that they met along the way to accept this thing
[1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:13.720]  called money which they never used most of them before they'd never seen money
[1:40:13.720 --> 1:40:16.680]  heard of it as an alien thought just like the american
[1:40:16.680 --> 1:40:19.880]  indians it was an alien idea but it's money
[1:40:19.880 --> 1:40:23.640]  and so eventually over time they got people to accept money
[1:40:23.640 --> 1:40:27.640]  and they did it by giving them loans to countries generally to the kings or the
[1:40:27.640 --> 1:40:31.640]  head chief or whoever of a particular area or island
[1:40:31.640 --> 1:40:36.200]  and from then on basically they started the debt system
[1:40:36.200 --> 1:40:39.640]  and as we all know we're still in the same system today it's never failed
[1:40:39.640 --> 1:40:43.160]  eventually the king gets rather spoiled he wants all the goodies that he's shown
[1:40:43.160 --> 1:40:47.320]  from these traders as they come into port every so often he borrows more
[1:40:47.320 --> 1:40:50.440]  and eventually it comes time to pay him back
[1:40:50.440 --> 1:40:53.960]  and he's rather shocked to find out how much it's going to cost
[1:40:53.960 --> 1:40:57.800]  so the Phoenicians that deals with them they we know this for a fact the
[1:40:57.800 --> 1:41:02.520]  Phoenicians used to get the kings to assemble men for armies
[1:41:02.520 --> 1:41:06.280]  pay them with the same thing called money that's a key to armies as well
[1:41:06.280 --> 1:41:11.240]  an army is no use an organized army if you can't pay them with something they
[1:41:11.240 --> 1:41:14.440]  tend to go home they get bogged and get fed up
[1:41:14.440 --> 1:41:18.920]  so they used that they just lent the king money for paying the soldiers too
[1:41:18.920 --> 1:41:22.440]  and then they go off and invade a country that would not accept the trade
[1:41:22.440 --> 1:41:26.280]  it would not accept the money and so on and we find this all the way down
[1:41:26.280 --> 1:41:30.760]  through into even the spartan wars where the spartans for a hundred years
[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:34.280]  fought off this outside trade system with this money
[1:41:34.280 --> 1:41:37.640]  system and the Phoenicians not only traded with with money it was mainly
[1:41:37.640 --> 1:41:42.200]  silver at that time they had standardized the size of the coinage
[1:41:42.200 --> 1:41:44.600]  everywhere it doesn't matter whose head was on it
[1:41:44.600 --> 1:41:47.880]  for different countries this wasn't weighed the same so they were standardizing
[1:41:47.880 --> 1:41:52.680]  the money system just like the IMF is today same idea
[1:41:52.680 --> 1:41:58.040]  and so they conquered down through the ages and then they formed we found this
[1:41:58.040 --> 1:42:02.520]  around the middle ages massive leagues they called them
[1:42:02.520 --> 1:42:06.280]  there were leagues they had the hanseatic leagues and every other leagues
[1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:11.480]  of trading countries and like a big corporation you might say
[1:42:11.480 --> 1:42:16.360]  and they were based at that time in venice and in holland
[1:42:16.360 --> 1:42:20.680]  holland came out of nowhere because the moneymen came in that's how
[1:42:20.680 --> 1:42:24.360]  empires arise they don't arise because someone's a great conqueror
[1:42:24.360 --> 1:42:28.520]  that's why they arise because those with the money move into that country with
[1:42:28.520 --> 1:42:33.080]  the money and the know-how and they rise it up
[1:42:33.080 --> 1:42:38.040]  they move down through time and skip to different countries when it suits them
[1:42:38.040 --> 1:42:41.320]  may know for instance that from even from holland they hopped over to london
[1:42:41.320 --> 1:42:47.800]  and basically created london and the farm that we know it today
[1:42:47.800 --> 1:42:52.920]  so it's a money system it's a trading system
[1:42:52.920 --> 1:42:56.280]  and money is the key to controlling everything
[1:42:56.280 --> 1:43:00.520]  that's what Rothschild said when he took over the bank of england
[1:43:00.520 --> 1:43:04.840]  and i don't believe either by the way that it wasn't a set up to take over the
[1:43:04.840 --> 1:43:08.600]  bank it was prearranged with the nobility already in
[1:43:08.600 --> 1:43:12.840]  britain to allow it to happen because if rothschild had bankrupted every
[1:43:12.840 --> 1:43:16.360]  nobility he would have lasted very long on his feet so long well that's on
[1:43:16.360 --> 1:43:22.600]  record he made deals with the nobility even before he staged the 1815
[1:43:22.600 --> 1:43:28.040]  panic and you also you also find out to alex that that
[1:43:28.040 --> 1:43:33.640]  i mean see the brooding king george and his family over from prussia now prussia
[1:43:33.640 --> 1:43:37.320]  as part of the pre-existing germany the germanic regions
[1:43:37.320 --> 1:43:42.120]  i was one of the first countries to give up in germany they actually put up their
[1:43:42.120 --> 1:43:45.800]  when they ran out of royalty they would put it up for a vote for
[1:43:45.800 --> 1:43:48.680]  for those with the biggest like an auction sale
[1:43:48.680 --> 1:43:55.240]  and that present even today's present group who took over as the georgias
[1:43:55.240 --> 1:43:58.920]  that were belong to the sax colberg goth houses he was
[1:43:58.920 --> 1:44:01.960]  these were three areas of the germanic and prussian regions
[1:44:01.960 --> 1:44:06.120]  which they owned they were princetums they bought them over and they became the
[1:44:06.120 --> 1:44:09.160]  royalty their actual background was in trading
[1:44:09.160 --> 1:44:12.440]  themselves so they belong to the same group as the rothschild
[1:44:12.440 --> 1:44:16.360]  and they also were the last country really to end slavery we always hear
[1:44:16.360 --> 1:44:20.040]  about blacks being slaves here but in in those different
[1:44:20.040 --> 1:44:26.440]  germanic regions austria and in what is germany today you had the military
[1:44:26.440 --> 1:44:32.440]  slaves or the hessians yes that's what they did too they drafted their men up
[1:44:32.440 --> 1:44:37.400]  and sold them off and during the american war of revolution
[1:44:37.400 --> 1:44:41.240]  they they brought on a lot of hessian troops because george was a hessian
[1:44:41.240 --> 1:44:45.720]  himself we think that was his area in germany he still owned that part of it
[1:44:45.720 --> 1:44:47.960]  but you'll find for instance the rothschilds
[1:44:47.960 --> 1:44:52.760]  and the different female lineages especially of the rothschilds
[1:44:52.760 --> 1:44:56.840]  are all intermarried with the royalty of the whole of europe
[1:44:56.840 --> 1:45:00.440]  and and so they're really one and all the same people
[1:45:00.440 --> 1:45:05.160]  so as i see that's a big part of it so you have money you have trading you have
[1:45:05.160 --> 1:45:10.280]  intermarriage of very powerful families and the there's nothing better than to
[1:45:10.280 --> 1:45:13.960]  give your daughter for instance to a king because now you're
[1:45:13.960 --> 1:45:16.920]  allied with that king and you take the royal titles
[1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:19.400]  your offspring become the heirs down the road
[1:45:19.400 --> 1:45:23.480]  and you can control things that's a very old old text and all of those major
[1:45:23.480 --> 1:45:27.240]  dynasties uh were were and are intermarried and
[1:45:27.240 --> 1:45:32.280]  now we see goldman sacks heads marrying in and the daughters of presidents
[1:45:32.280 --> 1:45:36.680]  marrying in and all of those psychopathic and abusive
[1:45:36.680 --> 1:45:40.600]  uh sadomasochistic genetic traits are then passed on
[1:45:40.600 --> 1:45:47.320]  and concentrated and even find a astonishing things in history that
[1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:51.560]  really get to you when you find an easy example
[1:45:51.560 --> 1:45:56.360]  for instance is 9-11 where down the road in new york the day that it
[1:45:56.360 --> 1:46:01.080]  happened george bush's father uh was having a meeting
[1:46:01.080 --> 1:46:04.440]  with with the laden family the ben laden family
[1:46:04.440 --> 1:46:08.600]  because they have a corporation uh the bushies and the laden families
[1:46:08.600 --> 1:46:13.560]  to build bombproof structures across the world yeah that's ap that's ap in
[1:46:13.560 --> 1:46:15.720]  london guardian bush senior meeting with head of
[1:46:15.720 --> 1:46:20.920]  ben laden family on morning of 9-11 uh at the carlile group meeting
[1:46:20.920 --> 1:46:25.240]  that's right and not only that too uh when the first 9-11 bombing took place
[1:46:25.240 --> 1:46:29.640]  people forget about to get to basically retrofit the whole the whole
[1:46:29.640 --> 1:46:33.240]  buildings to make sure they were sound well it was their company that got the
[1:46:33.240 --> 1:46:37.080]  job to retrofit it and it took them over a year and a half i think that's when
[1:46:37.080 --> 1:46:40.200]  they laid the explosives personally that's what they did i think every do
[1:46:40.200 --> 1:46:44.600]  believe that but anyway uh there's a coincidence right there so we go to war
[1:46:44.600 --> 1:46:49.640]  because uh what with with the bush basically facing ben laden in the
[1:46:49.640 --> 1:46:53.080]  comic strips that is and meanwhile the same families have a
[1:46:53.080 --> 1:46:57.240]  business enterprise that's almost impossible and they love sick jokes to
[1:46:57.240 --> 1:47:01.000]  say ben laden did it when actually that company was in there
[1:47:01.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  in the buildings years before after the 93 bombing in a sick way
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:09.960]  yeah they did bomb it yeah and it really is it's a cartoon
[1:47:09.960 --> 1:47:14.040]  show were given where the bush is in the laden's out of millions of billions of
[1:47:14.040 --> 1:47:17.080]  people in the planet just happened to be in a business enterprise
[1:47:17.080 --> 1:47:20.280]  and the same the same countries end up at war and all that kind of stuff and
[1:47:20.280 --> 1:47:24.120]  then marvin bush was running security on the world trade center complex until
[1:47:24.120 --> 1:47:27.640]  the morning of september 11th he'd signed over authority and they'd got a
[1:47:27.640 --> 1:47:33.320]  new management firm yes and then you went to fdr for instance fdr
[1:47:33.320 --> 1:47:37.240]  um whose wife was a rabid communist she loved
[1:47:37.240 --> 1:47:44.200]  the the the Soviet system she she she loved the techniques of mind control
[1:47:44.200 --> 1:47:47.640]  the pavlov was doing she went over to see pavlov
[1:47:47.640 --> 1:47:51.560]  and she thought the semen system should be brought to america because
[1:47:51.560 --> 1:47:55.880]  although the children were not very happy um and laughing and joking on the
[1:47:55.880 --> 1:47:59.560]  way to school they were so orderly and she was so impressed by this orderly
[1:47:59.560 --> 1:48:03.800]  how they were orderly and collective so but the thing is too in one of her
[1:48:03.800 --> 1:48:09.240]  books she put down the genealogy of fdr and herself because she was a cousin
[1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:14.200]  of fdr the intramari to keep power and wealth amongst themselves
[1:48:14.200 --> 1:48:22.040]  and you find that the sacks family who initially funded hitler to power
[1:48:22.040 --> 1:48:28.200]  was a relative of of fdr and again it's the same kind of sacks family of
[1:48:28.200 --> 1:48:31.640]  goldman sacks basically you you can change the name and a spelling a
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:34.040]  little bit here and there which is a favorite trick of theirs down through
[1:48:34.040 --> 1:48:37.800]  the ages but it's the same bunch really running the show
[1:48:37.800 --> 1:48:42.040]  and he brought in a new deal now people don't realize when a president
[1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:47.320]  gives you an address to the nation and calls something a new deal
[1:48:47.320 --> 1:48:51.640]  he's he's giving you something that supersedes or replaces the constitution
[1:48:51.640 --> 1:48:56.040]  yeah this is the new america i mean it's like what obama's saying change
[1:48:56.040 --> 1:48:59.960]  this is a new deal absolutely absolutely and that's what changes
[1:48:59.960 --> 1:49:03.720]  you're you're right on with that because this is the century of change now these
[1:49:03.720 --> 1:49:07.000]  characters all know what they mean by the century of change
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:10.600]  it's the culmination of their of their centuries long
[1:49:10.600 --> 1:49:15.640]  uh at war to take over a world standardize the world
[1:49:15.640 --> 1:49:19.800]  um basically reduce the population to a manageable level they've had
[1:49:19.800 --> 1:49:22.760]  science is at the top of the tree when it comes to their belief system they
[1:49:22.760 --> 1:49:27.720]  believe that the science and sciences um then they can control because if you
[1:49:27.720 --> 1:49:31.640]  can eradicate countries and then even individuals there's no way to resist
[1:49:31.640 --> 1:49:35.000]  because you've got a drugged out mindless zombie drooling telling you
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:39.080]  about ufc fights absolutely and from the earliest
[1:49:39.080 --> 1:49:42.600]  times even when rosa christianism which is a front group
[1:49:42.600 --> 1:49:46.440]  basically to help the the dominant group when rosa
[1:49:46.440 --> 1:49:50.680]  rosa christian and broke out really in france that posters out there
[1:49:50.680 --> 1:49:55.560]  and all over the paris one morning and he talked about the ability to give
[1:49:55.560 --> 1:49:58.520]  longevity to those who would help serve them
[1:49:58.520 --> 1:50:03.160]  and they were really into real chemistry not alchemy alchemy was a front for
[1:50:03.160 --> 1:50:06.120]  them uh but they were into real chemistry and
[1:50:06.120 --> 1:50:09.240]  real real they admitted that two days ago that oh the
[1:50:09.240 --> 1:50:13.320]  chinese 4 000 years ago were in trade with america
[1:50:13.320 --> 1:50:16.920]  and with africa oh and the nobility of europe always knew this
[1:50:16.920 --> 1:50:19.960]  they had all the maps they were just keeping the public in the dark
[1:50:19.960 --> 1:50:23.080]  during that period of re-engineering absolutely
[1:50:23.080 --> 1:50:26.440]  absolutely and they can take whole chunks of history away they've done it
[1:50:26.440 --> 1:50:30.760]  before because we know darn well that there were people here in
[1:50:30.760 --> 1:50:35.240]  america's lawn before columbus and the bash professors who've come
[1:50:35.240 --> 1:50:38.040]  up with the evidence to well no they've tested the dna of
[1:50:38.040 --> 1:50:41.880]  nav americans and uh it's it's it's northern european
[1:50:41.880 --> 1:50:45.640]  uh in the last 15 000 years of the mitochondrial dna because they were all
[1:50:45.640 --> 1:50:48.280]  here in america they've dug them up all over the country the media keeps it
[1:50:48.280 --> 1:50:50.760]  quite quiet they dig vikings up every year
[1:50:50.760 --> 1:50:53.960]  we'll be right back with alan watt the true history of the world
[1:50:53.960 --> 1:50:58.760]  and what's currently happening straight ahead i'm alex jones

[1:51:05.640 --> 1:51:09.400]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable
[1:51:09.400 --> 1:51:12.200]  than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even
[1:51:12.200 --> 1:51:15.480]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[1:51:15.480 --> 1:51:18.360]  again so our friends at solutions from science
[1:51:18.360 --> 1:51:21.480]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[1:51:21.480 --> 1:51:25.000]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce

[1:51:59.240 --> 1:52:02.120]  but only because you're paying attention what's happening in the Gulf of
[1:52:02.120 --> 1:52:06.520]  Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature a similar audacity called gmo or
[1:52:06.520 --> 1:52:09.320]  genetically modified organisms means that the quality of
[1:52:09.320 --> 1:52:13.080]  commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance
[1:52:13.080 --> 1:52:16.200]  now that summer's here what better time to learn about the bounty that nature

[1:54:09.800 --> 1:54:12.520]  next hour here in a few minutes
[1:54:12.520 --> 1:54:16.360]  alan going back though not just looking at trade and money and in governments
[1:54:16.360 --> 1:54:20.520]  that could create caste systems and organization
[1:54:20.520 --> 1:54:24.680]  were very small members of you know europe in the last four thousand years
[1:54:24.680 --> 1:54:28.360]  went to northern india and took over they've tested their mitochondrial
[1:54:28.360 --> 1:54:33.560]  dna uh they're a central and western european
[1:54:33.560 --> 1:54:37.960]  not just that but also the priest class of manipulation and learning
[1:54:37.960 --> 1:54:42.440]  how to control the population that's a big key to this secret knowledge that's
[1:54:42.440 --> 1:54:46.680]  passed on as well yes uh the the studying of
[1:54:46.680 --> 1:54:50.920]  as i have always said we see so many nature programs on television
[1:54:50.920 --> 1:54:55.000]  uh but we don't realize that mankind has been the most studied creature on the
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:59.160]  planet for thousands of thousands of years if you want to dominate the planet
[1:54:59.160 --> 1:55:02.520]  you don't dominate the ants you want to dominate people
[1:55:02.520 --> 1:55:05.320]  and you have to know how people think how they take
[1:55:05.320 --> 1:55:08.920]  and it's quite easy actually because the easiest thing is to go into
[1:55:08.920 --> 1:55:13.560]  so-called primitive societies and see the microcosm of what really matters
[1:55:13.560 --> 1:55:17.880]  because everything else comes from those primitive ideas lifestyles taboos and so
[1:55:17.880 --> 1:55:21.960]  on you simply amplify it into an into a more complex system
[1:55:21.960 --> 1:55:25.400]  they're really all the same and uh they understand
[1:55:25.400 --> 1:55:29.720]  how human beings interact with each other and and how they have certain
[1:55:29.720 --> 1:55:32.840]  emotions how they're driven really by emotions
[1:55:32.840 --> 1:55:36.680]  that's the key to it that's what bernie's came out with too you can
[1:55:36.680 --> 1:55:40.920]  you literally modify the behavior of a whole continent or a whole world
[1:55:40.920 --> 1:55:45.320]  by pandering to these subconscious desires and emotions
[1:55:45.320 --> 1:55:49.000]  and get people to buy things they don't even really
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:53.240]  they've never thought of before uh until the ads come out to make them
[1:55:53.240 --> 1:55:56.920]  want this thing for the first time it's the same thing but thus we have
[1:55:56.920 --> 1:56:00.680]  the need to mate with people for instance and so
[1:56:00.680 --> 1:56:05.160]  so uh people mate if they form tribes small tribes
[1:56:05.160 --> 1:56:09.480]  the tribes have the various taboos that helps them to survive everyone knows
[1:56:09.480 --> 1:56:13.720]  the rules you don't need police uh and they're generally very
[1:56:13.720 --> 1:56:16.840]  self-sufficient completely self-sufficient in fact
[1:56:16.840 --> 1:56:20.120]  and the globalists admit to steal your thunder
[1:56:20.120 --> 1:56:24.120]  that they come in and just and remove the taboos and tell people be wild and
[1:56:24.120 --> 1:56:28.600]  crazy so society degenerates so the government can come in with its new
[1:56:28.600 --> 1:56:33.240]  taboos and be more oppressive yes and of course we find
[1:56:33.240 --> 1:56:37.400]  from the 1800s for instance when the same organization
[1:56:37.400 --> 1:56:41.400]  uh that i had the same organization that put Charles Darwin out there now
[1:56:41.400 --> 1:56:45.720]  Darwin was put out there by the royal society
[1:56:45.720 --> 1:56:49.400]  in fact Wallace was the guy they took most of the writings about evolution
[1:56:49.400 --> 1:56:52.520]  from but they also used Charles Darwin's father and
[1:56:52.520 --> 1:56:56.120]  grandfather's writings because they were both writing about evolution
[1:56:56.120 --> 1:57:01.240]  this is a belief system within a religion that was far far older than Darwin
[1:57:01.240 --> 1:57:04.520]  and we know the Darwin's themselves practiced this religion by only
[1:57:04.520 --> 1:57:08.520]  intermarrying the same family the Wedgwood family
[1:57:08.520 --> 1:57:12.680]  for many generations that was part of this religion
[1:57:12.680 --> 1:57:16.440]  intermarriage with special types to try and breed
[1:57:16.440 --> 1:57:20.840]  special genes and Plato actually wrote about
[1:57:20.840 --> 1:57:24.440]  thousands of years before that two thousand three hundred years before
[1:57:24.440 --> 1:57:29.560]  Plato talks about if you want good scientists good mathematicians then you
[1:57:29.560 --> 1:57:33.480]  you simply intermarry a male and a female who are good at mathematics
[1:57:33.480 --> 1:57:38.040]  and then take the children interbreed them and so on and so on until you have
[1:57:38.040 --> 1:57:41.000]  you're pretty well guaranteed a good mathematician
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:45.400]  and it's the same with all other aspects of life well we have that today
[1:57:45.400 --> 1:57:49.240]  and we've had it for a long time the Rothschilds are an example with that they
[1:57:49.240 --> 1:57:52.760]  only married their nieces and so and they used to
[1:57:52.760 --> 1:57:56.520]  astound me i says why would dynasties not change why not
[1:57:56.520 --> 1:57:59.400]  why wouldn't you get a guy from the long scene why don't want to be a banker
[1:57:59.400 --> 1:58:03.400]  daddy i'd rather be something else an actor or something it doesn't happen
[1:58:03.400 --> 1:58:06.680]  they're pretty well guaranteed to be just like their father as you see
[1:58:06.680 --> 1:58:09.480]  but they also have the addition of a reinforcement
[1:58:09.480 --> 1:58:12.760]  of a particular education from their family
[1:58:12.760 --> 1:58:16.920]  and from special high higher priests into their particular
[1:58:16.920 --> 1:58:21.160]  lineages their histories and their functions and then
[1:58:21.160 --> 1:58:25.880]  in the in the pyramidal structure there are servants specializing gills
[1:58:25.880 --> 1:58:30.280]  and these gills then support those ruling families
[1:58:30.280 --> 1:58:34.280]  and those sub guilds also then intermarry within their strata
[1:58:34.280 --> 1:58:40.920]  of the pyramidal beehive system back in 70 seconds
[1:58:40.920 --> 1:58:47.960]  thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today
[1:58:47.960 --> 1:58:51.160]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[1:58:51.160 --> 1:58:55.240]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[1:58:55.240 --> 1:58:57.720]  double or triple your electric bill number two
[1:58:57.720 --> 1:59:01.560]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:59:01.560 --> 1:59:04.760]  allows you to have it's true total government control of
[1:59:04.760 --> 1:59:08.280]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:59:08.280 --> 1:59:11.960]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:59:11.960 --> 1:59:14.920]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[1:59:14.920 --> 1:59:18.840]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[1:59:18.840 --> 1:59:21.960]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[1:59:21.960 --> 1:59:25.880]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[1:59:25.880 --> 1:59:28.760]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[1:59:28.760 --> 1:59:31.880]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[1:59:31.880 --> 1:59:34.600]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more

[1:59:49.480 --> 2:00:01.000]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio
[2:00:01.080 --> 2:00:07.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[2:00:07.400 --> 2:00:14.760]  well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from
[2:00:14.760 --> 2:00:21.960]  austin texas alex jones
[2:00:21.960 --> 2:00:25.240]  i've got a bunch of twitter questions for alan waddy's with us throughout the
[2:00:25.240 --> 2:00:30.760]  rest of the hour and doug christan and others that are patiently holding the
[2:00:30.760 --> 2:00:35.560]  toll free number to join us is 800-25 at 99231 also want to get into the economy
[2:00:35.560 --> 2:00:39.080]  and military developments with him but finishing up in this short little
[2:00:39.080 --> 2:00:41.880]  segment we've talked about the history of the
[2:00:41.880 --> 2:00:46.440]  elite their systems of control but talking about their in game i mean it
[2:00:46.440 --> 2:00:50.520]  it is a totally selfish horrible in game they've got all these
[2:00:50.520 --> 2:00:54.520]  mid-level and low-level people on power trips with their little uniforms and
[2:00:54.520 --> 2:00:58.520]  segments and logos of power that that defend the system having no
[2:00:58.520 --> 2:01:02.120]  idea what the system is but the globalists are now out in the open
[2:01:02.120 --> 2:01:05.160]  the system is exterminating 80 to 90 percent of people
[2:01:05.160 --> 2:01:08.600]  having 10 to 20 left as a sub void servant class
[2:01:08.600 --> 2:01:12.440]  and the elite merging into biomechanical
[2:01:12.440 --> 2:01:16.280]  androids and living forever now i'm not saying that's real or going to happen
[2:01:16.280 --> 2:01:19.080]  but you go back to the french revolution and other times they promise
[2:01:19.080 --> 2:01:21.800]  their people will give you secrets to live to 100
[2:01:21.800 --> 2:01:25.800]  so so they always use the same stuff they always promise their socialism is
[2:01:25.800 --> 2:01:30.120]  some type of high-tech utopia we see manifestations of that
[2:01:30.120 --> 2:01:34.520]  so let's spend a few minutes on what their in game is
[2:01:34.520 --> 2:01:39.480]  well again to the end game you have to go back into their their ancient belief system
[2:01:39.480 --> 2:01:44.920]  which is that basically the world was created all
[2:01:44.920 --> 2:01:48.920]  wrong and their job is to perfect that which was left
[2:01:48.920 --> 2:01:53.800]  imperfect which means through science they would perfect the world everything
[2:01:53.800 --> 2:01:56.200]  in it we see that with the the modification of
[2:01:56.200 --> 2:02:01.160]  plants and trees and everything today and and man himself of course
[2:02:01.160 --> 2:02:04.600]  because they being the dominant psychopathic
[2:02:04.600 --> 2:02:09.240]  type really and you can certainly pass on psychopathy it's the same thing
[2:02:09.240 --> 2:02:12.760]  if you want a a pitbull you can read a good pitbull by
[2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:16.040]  interpreting pitbulls and you're guaranteed to have the same kind of
[2:02:16.040 --> 2:02:19.000]  offspring well it's the same with these characters
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:22.840]  down through the ages they picked the victorious type the type who dominated
[2:02:22.840 --> 2:02:25.960]  whole countries eventually either through warfare directly
[2:02:25.960 --> 2:02:29.560]  or through owning the kings and queens who did the wars for you
[2:02:29.560 --> 2:02:33.560]  so they're very aggressive but they also believe that he can alter man himself
[2:02:33.560 --> 2:02:36.760]  their idiot savants their idiot savants of control
[2:02:36.760 --> 2:02:41.240]  and they're playing god in all these countless articles the last two weeks
[2:02:41.240 --> 2:02:44.520]  where they're saying lithium's good for you or viruses to reprogram your brain
[2:02:44.520 --> 2:02:48.680]  to make you submissive they said man's defects in all these articles
[2:02:48.680 --> 2:02:53.480]  man's problems we're going to fix it yeah and what they don't mention of course
[2:02:53.480 --> 2:02:58.520]  in all their articles is that you see they were the ones who in the 1800s
[2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:03.400]  especially came out openly with guys like H.G. Wells
[2:03:03.400 --> 2:03:07.160]  who was specially trained by Huxley's grandfather
[2:03:07.160 --> 2:03:12.120]  you know Thomas Huxley who was the best friend of Charles Darwin
[2:03:12.120 --> 2:03:16.760]  and H.G. Wells with a bunch of other guys trained to be authors to put stuff out
[2:03:16.760 --> 2:03:21.720]  there for the public to be amazed by and even want to follow in fact
[2:03:21.720 --> 2:03:25.480]  H.G. Wells came out with the idea of free love we're going to destroy marriage
[2:03:25.480 --> 2:03:29.560]  all together because marriage is the basic institution of the tribe be it
[2:03:29.560 --> 2:03:33.400]  primitive or advanced and if you destroy that you destroy
[2:03:33.400 --> 2:03:37.320]  basically the tribe's ability to be cohesive and
[2:03:37.320 --> 2:03:40.520]  that's what of course Brave New World is about is the state controlling and
[2:03:40.520 --> 2:03:43.880]  raising the children he stated and of course the
[2:03:43.880 --> 2:03:47.960]  the Wedgewoods the Gaultons the Darwin's they all
[2:03:47.960 --> 2:03:51.320]  intermarried as you said earlier and the Huxley's too
[2:03:51.320 --> 2:03:54.440]  they're all belong to the same families actually they're all related to that
[2:03:54.440 --> 2:03:59.240]  whole bunch he just mentioned and what you find too is to say
[2:03:59.240 --> 2:04:05.160]  if you destroy the basic tribal necessities then you destroy the
[2:04:05.160 --> 2:04:09.400]  tribe and they won't fight you see they're lost if you look at the
[2:04:09.400 --> 2:04:12.920]  Darwin theory a thought that advanced civilization going in
[2:04:12.920 --> 2:04:16.360]  to a less advanced civilization the advanced will always
[2:04:16.360 --> 2:04:19.800]  triumph that's what they tell you and for the use of an example that's what
[2:04:19.800 --> 2:04:23.080]  happened to America when the white man came in
[2:04:23.080 --> 2:04:27.560]  and what happened to the American Indians the writings of John Stuart Mills
[2:04:27.560 --> 2:04:31.160]  is very good on this because they knew in the 1700s what would happen to the
[2:04:31.160 --> 2:04:33.720]  Indians because you can't survive if you're not part of their

[2:07:56.440 --> 2:08:05.240]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[2:08:06.040 --> 2:08:10.040]  we're talking about the only issue that matters the issue that
[2:08:10.040 --> 2:08:14.840]  encompasses everything the scientific dictatorship
[2:08:14.840 --> 2:08:18.680]  in textbook under textbook written 100 years ago
[2:08:18.680 --> 2:08:23.960]  30 years ago 10 years ago a year ago it's all repeated it's all on record
[2:08:23.960 --> 2:08:27.480]  vaccines to reduce your fertility or sterilize you chemicals in the food
[2:08:27.480 --> 2:08:30.840]  and water and packaging to sterilize you and give you cancer
[2:08:30.840 --> 2:08:35.800]  to reduce your lifespan they're lying to you about lifespan
[2:08:35.800 --> 2:08:39.000]  in the past large numbers of children die before the age of 10
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:44.520]  if you take the low more lifespan of children out people
[2:08:44.520 --> 2:08:47.080]  live into their early 80s instead of their
[2:08:47.080 --> 2:08:52.200]  low 70s this is just the facts and they admit they're doing this and if
[2:08:52.200 --> 2:08:55.000]  you're a new listener like they say they're poisoning the food and water
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:08:58.120]  they say they want a world government i heard that's a conspiracy theory
[2:08:58.120 --> 2:09:01.560]  that's a simple throwaway line to make you procrastinate
[2:09:01.560 --> 2:09:05.640]  and not look into this it's a hundred percent
[2:09:05.640 --> 2:09:11.160]  it's a hundred percent on record everything alan watt and i are saying
[2:09:11.160 --> 2:09:15.320]  okay you can differ on our interpretation but this is going on you
[2:09:15.320 --> 2:09:19.000]  should be angry about that you should be standing up against that
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:23.720]  you should have respect for yourself but they've taken
[2:09:23.720 --> 2:09:26.920]  the basic determination away from people to where
[2:09:26.920 --> 2:09:29.640]  folks on the news say i don't care if they're saving my naked body scans i
[2:09:29.640 --> 2:09:32.520]  have nothing to hide first they lie to you and say they're not saving it
[2:09:32.520 --> 2:09:35.480]  they say there's no radiation now they admit it's very high
[2:09:35.480 --> 2:09:38.440]  now they say they're gonna put cameras in all the cars watching us and tracking
[2:09:38.440 --> 2:09:41.400]  us cameras in the backs of the seats watching you listening to you on the
[2:09:41.400 --> 2:09:44.600]  airplanes this is worse than orwell people say well there's
[2:09:44.600 --> 2:09:48.040]  already so much of it i guess i'll go along with it well then
[2:09:48.040 --> 2:09:52.600]  where does it end where does it stop alan looking at time frames with these
[2:09:52.600 --> 2:09:55.240]  people unless we get the word out and then
[2:09:55.240 --> 2:09:58.200]  they'll just back off and move slower but right now it seems they're rushing
[2:09:58.200 --> 2:10:01.960]  well doesn't seem we know they're rushing towards the goal post
[2:10:01.960 --> 2:10:05.800]  that uh they're accelerating their entire program and that all of the
[2:10:05.800 --> 2:10:09.720]  birth pains we've seen so far were just preludes that
[2:10:09.720 --> 2:10:14.920]  we haven't seen anything yet that's right even bush senior when he came out
[2:10:14.920 --> 2:10:19.320]  with his speech on the new world order he said
[2:10:19.320 --> 2:10:22.760]  it's coming into view it's coming into view
[2:10:22.760 --> 2:10:26.200]  and what he meant by that is the coming a new american century
[2:10:26.200 --> 2:10:30.600]  this is the century of change that academia were using was using that term
[2:10:30.600 --> 2:10:34.760]  for 50 years in the 20th century the century of change with the 20th
[2:10:34.760 --> 2:10:37.960]  first century that's where they had to ramp ahead because
[2:10:37.960 --> 2:10:41.560]  they'd already dumbed down the people with inoculations and so on
[2:10:41.560 --> 2:10:45.720]  and again bringing in processed food to certain
[2:10:45.720 --> 2:10:50.280]  and it also destroyed pretty well again all the natural things that bound the
[2:10:50.280 --> 2:10:53.560]  people together marge was totally destroyed by the end of the 20th
[2:10:53.560 --> 2:10:58.280]  century and because of there's an attack on it and it's even that whole area is
[2:10:58.280 --> 2:11:01.640]  so fascinating to read that the sectors that were put out there
[2:11:01.640 --> 2:11:06.360]  to bring down that the family units to bring in the drugs the rock and roll
[2:11:06.360 --> 2:11:10.600]  the free love and all the rest of it the very things hg wells printed in the
[2:11:10.600 --> 2:11:14.600]  late 1800s to bring in free love and so on
[2:11:14.600 --> 2:11:18.600]  and um and he was part of orgies with margaret sanger
[2:11:18.600 --> 2:11:21.720]  oh yeah hg wells was more than that i mean he made
[2:11:21.720 --> 2:11:25.000]  um agreements with his three wives i think
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:29.640]  uh never to divulge what he actually got up to relax getting spanked and tied up
[2:11:29.640 --> 2:11:33.880]  and all this stinky stuff you know most these guys are perverse understand
[2:11:33.880 --> 2:11:37.080]  the work uh for them to tie her up and near the top
[2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:41.560]  they're they're all sito masochistic types cheap sito masochism is a big part
[2:11:41.560 --> 2:11:46.120]  of this because um a sito masochist uh wants to get
[2:11:46.120 --> 2:11:49.080]  up into the power ranks when they're psychopathic
[2:11:49.080 --> 2:11:53.240]  and they really worship the person above them they'll worship them
[2:11:53.240 --> 2:11:56.760]  and they despise the person who down below even the next
[2:11:56.760 --> 2:12:00.520]  level down even a military structure is being weak
[2:12:00.520 --> 2:12:04.520]  and they'll abuse them so that's your sito masochist they
[2:12:04.520 --> 2:12:09.320]  flock in to be being willing servants for these guys who run the world
[2:12:09.320 --> 2:12:13.080]  and so this is against an old technique as well well understood by them
[2:12:13.080 --> 2:12:17.400]  but they always have these odd perversions to do with sito masochistic
[2:12:17.400 --> 2:12:23.080]  tendencies in their sexual life as well yeah let's go ahead and take
[2:12:23.080 --> 2:12:27.640]  some phone calls but before i do that alan any other issues or items that you
[2:12:27.640 --> 2:12:30.680]  think are important that should be discussed today
[2:12:30.680 --> 2:12:35.800]  yes but what we understand is as simple you take the primitive tribe we're
[2:12:35.800 --> 2:12:40.280]  all really just basically primitive tribal with tribal tribal instincts
[2:12:40.280 --> 2:12:45.000]  you destroy all of those you destroy your cultural taboos
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:49.160]  and when you have nothing left to hold on to then you're in free fall and they
[2:12:49.160 --> 2:12:52.680]  can then guide you as to where you're going to go in that new free fall
[2:12:52.680 --> 2:12:57.080]  that's what they've done with most of society if they don't replace
[2:12:57.080 --> 2:13:00.680]  all that that they've destroyed you end up with the people like the american
[2:13:00.680 --> 2:13:04.520]  indians who like in canada are simply
[2:13:04.520 --> 2:13:07.880]  abject cases they're chronic alcoholics they
[2:13:07.880 --> 2:13:12.120]  all all the reasons for living have been taken away all their old customs are
[2:13:12.120 --> 2:13:15.560]  taken away things that gave them meaning are destroyed
[2:13:15.560 --> 2:13:19.800]  and that's what they do so they've had big scandals where they take the
[2:13:19.800 --> 2:13:23.800]  little indian children the natives currently this is even in the news
[2:13:23.800 --> 2:13:28.920]  and they just kill them they're at the facility they they they murder them
[2:13:28.920 --> 2:13:31.880]  yes they do that they're still digging them up in canada
[2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:35.080]  at some of these places and out west in fact
[2:13:35.080 --> 2:13:39.960]  but um it's very similar to what i've done with the european races they came
[2:13:39.960 --> 2:13:43.720]  into north america now and the europeans themselves their cultures were
[2:13:43.720 --> 2:13:46.920]  attacked later in the same way once we've been
[2:13:46.920 --> 2:13:50.520]  over the industrial revolution created the scientific things they needed to
[2:13:50.520 --> 2:13:54.520]  control us we all work towards it your work dads and grandfathers work
[2:13:54.520 --> 2:13:58.840]  towards it and and the metro universities too
[2:13:58.840 --> 2:14:02.600]  well i mean looking at psychology and and and and
[2:14:02.600 --> 2:14:05.960]  anthropology never going to call if i don't want your your view on this alan
[2:14:05.960 --> 2:14:10.280]  if you look at the american culture that alexander detogue full wrote about of
[2:14:10.280 --> 2:14:14.920]  you know french historian or others all strong cultures are
[2:14:14.920 --> 2:14:19.160]  self-sufficient the family's number one a husband wouldn't
[2:14:19.160 --> 2:14:22.040]  do something mean to his wife because he understands it's part of the unit the
[2:14:22.040 --> 2:14:25.880]  wife wouldn't do it the children know the only
[2:14:25.880 --> 2:14:30.120]  people they can count on as their family now through the sitcoms and the movies
[2:14:30.120 --> 2:14:32.840]  and the women's magazines it's fun to break up
[2:14:32.840 --> 2:14:36.920]  it's fun to fight with each other so they can isolate you as the individual
[2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:40.840]  animal and destroy you and now you look at it
[2:14:40.840 --> 2:14:45.480]  uh and and quote feminism is supposed to empower women it's turned them into
[2:14:45.480 --> 2:14:50.280]  just bestial creatures same thing with men they give us false tribes of ut
[2:14:50.280 --> 2:14:53.800]  football instead of the normal tribalism of your family
[2:14:53.800 --> 2:14:57.320]  and your private property and controlling your own mind and they just
[2:14:57.320 --> 2:15:02.280]  you try to talk to full grown adults their mental midgets a serious man
[2:15:02.280 --> 2:15:05.720]  can't be obsessed with sports because you're
[2:15:05.720 --> 2:15:09.000]  there's too much going on in the world too much knowledge too many mysteries
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:13.400]  too many secrets too many competitors too you know too much
[2:15:13.400 --> 2:15:17.560]  they don't want us being dominant strong and aggressive and powerful and wild
[2:15:17.560 --> 2:15:22.040]  they want us being a bunch of soft punks and we are we're a bunch of soft punks
[2:15:22.040 --> 2:15:25.640]  that's right and that's what you do as the end product of a long
[2:15:25.640 --> 2:15:29.480]  term war to destroy everything that means things function
[2:15:29.480 --> 2:15:33.640]  and meet you independent and now you won't stand up and fight for anything
[2:15:33.640 --> 2:15:37.960]  that that's exactly the goal they had in mind well said
[2:15:37.960 --> 2:15:41.480]  alan watt is our guest cutting the matrix dot com our sites are info wars
[2:15:41.480 --> 2:15:45.320]  dot com and prison planet dot tv let's talk to dug in
[2:15:45.320 --> 2:15:49.560]  utah who i'm told disagrees i'll go to the headline go ahead dug
[2:15:49.560 --> 2:15:56.200]  hi yeah alex i uh and alan i uh i disagreed with uh alex opinion yesterday
[2:15:56.200 --> 2:16:00.040]  he talked about steven hawking's opinion that we must go off world immediately
[2:16:00.040 --> 2:16:03.480]  or it's almost certain that in the next hundred years we're going to destroy
[2:16:03.480 --> 2:16:08.200]  ourselves doesn't mean leave the planet i'm saying we've we need to
[2:16:08.200 --> 2:16:13.320]  we need to expand and not have the technologies hidden from us
[2:16:13.320 --> 2:16:16.200]  and and i agree with him there's a good chance with all these super weapons
[2:16:16.200 --> 2:16:18.440]  and genetic engineering that we're going to have serious
[2:16:18.440 --> 2:16:21.880]  catastrophes and the globalists are arrogant and think they can control it
[2:16:21.880 --> 2:16:24.440]  but oh finish your point we'll get alan's take on it
[2:16:24.440 --> 2:16:27.720]  yeah you said it's a virtual certainty that this planet will never become a
[2:16:27.720 --> 2:16:32.520]  type one civilization with the assault on of men on mankind from the elite
[2:16:32.520 --> 2:16:36.840]  and what my problem was is that vision is totally contrary to the vision
[2:16:36.840 --> 2:16:39.960]  that the holy providence of god described first in the scriptures and i
[2:16:39.960 --> 2:16:43.800]  wondered if alan uh had to take on that because you know those
[2:16:43.800 --> 2:16:48.440]  those are really the primary writings of civilization and they talk about these
[2:16:48.440 --> 2:16:52.760]  things it's amazing how much they talk about let me stop you for a minute
[2:16:52.760 --> 2:16:56.280]  alan's going to say it's just like ht wells a hundred years ago
[2:16:56.280 --> 2:17:00.120]  predicted programming uh self-fulfilling prophecy
[2:17:00.120 --> 2:17:04.680]  a missionary protectorate that frank herbert uh talked about in his series
[2:17:04.680 --> 2:17:09.000]  on dune giving you an art you know an off-world model of that
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:13.640]  i am a christian and i've read the bible but the last 150 years you've had this
[2:17:13.640 --> 2:17:17.160]  move to say never stand up to evil it's the end of the world
[2:17:17.160 --> 2:17:20.600]  you're not you know you can't change things and that's just not true and
[2:17:20.600 --> 2:17:26.360]  they've got this christianoid model now uh where they where we can't even have
[2:17:26.360 --> 2:17:29.240]  destiny or or we can't i mean the people told the
[2:17:29.240 --> 2:17:31.800]  founding fathers don't fight back at the end of the world
[2:17:31.800 --> 2:17:34.680]  people told the germans lay down to hitler it's the end of the world
[2:17:34.680 --> 2:17:39.720]  and i find it to be a cop out let me get a comment from alan one on that
[2:17:39.720 --> 2:17:45.240]  yes i mean religion's always been used by the powerful organizations that they
[2:17:45.240 --> 2:17:50.920]  end up taking them over and you find that um i personally um see the old
[2:17:50.920 --> 2:17:54.280]  testament for instance and that's a totally different way than most people
[2:17:54.280 --> 2:17:59.080]  i see more like a guidebook of of practical means of uh
[2:17:59.080 --> 2:18:03.480]  of conquering the world actually that's how i see it i i see the new testament
[2:18:03.480 --> 2:18:07.400]  but the but a different deity in charge all together from the old
[2:18:07.400 --> 2:18:12.600]  uh bloodthirsty yaoi and christianity in its basic
[2:18:12.600 --> 2:18:17.880]  initial form before it was taken over by remember an empire took it over a
[2:18:17.880 --> 2:18:21.480]  political military empire took it over and used it
[2:18:21.480 --> 2:18:25.720]  initial christianity was very simplistic and it's doctrine
[2:18:25.720 --> 2:18:29.640]  and so they used it again once it was taken over
[2:18:29.640 --> 2:18:33.480]  um they used it again to dominate people for
[2:18:33.480 --> 2:18:37.560]  one and a half thousand years really and then the the protestants
[2:18:37.560 --> 2:18:40.600]  said it was time to bring in the protestants that's how i see it it was
[2:18:40.600 --> 2:18:43.560]  time to bring in the protestants by those who ruled the money
[2:18:43.560 --> 2:18:46.840]  yeah let me say this to Doug let me say this to Doug look
[2:18:46.840 --> 2:18:50.760]  you injected religion into this and i have to know alan's views and that's
[2:18:50.760 --> 2:18:54.120]  one of the few areas that we differ on but i i do see his perspective and
[2:18:54.120 --> 2:18:57.320]  that's why all things are open for discussion here but
[2:18:57.320 --> 2:19:01.880]  but overall you know my parents church my dad said man i don't know i'm not
[2:19:01.880 --> 2:19:04.360]  able to go there anymore we got new preachers there and they're
[2:19:04.360 --> 2:19:07.320]  teaching us that we've got to have the illegal aliens basically come in
[2:19:07.320 --> 2:19:10.520]  that's the world council of churches and the rockefellers or
[2:19:10.520 --> 2:19:14.360]  catholic and protestant churches saying turn your guns in and fema secretly
[2:19:14.360 --> 2:19:17.960]  recruiting 50 plus thousand preachers for clergy response teams
[2:19:17.960 --> 2:19:21.320]  i mean we've got to recognize that they're telling us just give up
[2:19:21.320 --> 2:19:26.680]  lay down it's what jesus says and that's not what jesus even said alan
[2:19:26.680 --> 2:19:30.760]  yeah jesus didn't didn't tell you to leave your
[2:19:30.760 --> 2:19:34.600]  your head at the door you know of the church
[2:19:34.600 --> 2:19:38.360]  you're supposed to use your head well he went after the money changers he knew
[2:19:38.360 --> 2:19:41.800]  he went after the money power that was the last thing basically he did
[2:19:41.800 --> 2:19:45.400]  once he did that everything changed and
[2:19:45.400 --> 2:19:49.640]  there wasn't just money changers that was an international bank of the day

[2:24:35.480 --> 2:24:39.880]  cut you off you were saying he was challenging the international banking
[2:24:39.880 --> 2:24:44.200]  system at that time and and he was allen finish your point on that
[2:24:44.200 --> 2:24:50.360]  yeah you understand that that judeism even in that time had enclaves across
[2:24:50.360 --> 2:24:53.320]  the ancient world and all the capital cities
[2:24:53.320 --> 2:24:56.840]  of greece and so on Athens and all over the place roads and
[2:24:56.840 --> 2:24:59.800]  our famous place for them but they had to come back
[2:24:59.800 --> 2:25:04.040]  so many times per year to the great temple and they brought incredible
[2:25:04.040 --> 2:25:07.880]  fortunes with them and you couldn't get into the temple and no one no
[2:25:07.880 --> 2:25:11.080]  hebrou or jew or she say could get into the temple
[2:25:11.080 --> 2:25:15.720]  and without the actual money off the land so you have to exchange your money
[2:25:15.720 --> 2:25:18.680]  to get to go into the temple with your offerings
[2:25:18.680 --> 2:25:23.000]  and the basically the guys they were doing foreign exchange
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:26.600]  and they made incredible amounts of money on this from these people who came
[2:25:26.600 --> 2:25:30.760]  in every day from all over the ancient world the main manipulation was they
[2:25:30.760 --> 2:25:34.360]  made you buy a special coin to buy your sacrifice
[2:25:34.360 --> 2:25:40.920]  whether it was a cow or a sheep or birds and they would be huge
[2:25:40.920 --> 2:25:44.920]  piles of gold and silver for one little special silver coin
[2:25:44.920 --> 2:25:49.160]  yeah foreign foreign cash was unclean inside the temple but it was it was
[2:25:49.160 --> 2:25:52.040]  awfully good outside for the guys who exchanged it
[2:25:52.040 --> 2:25:55.800]  and they said exchange rates and it really was a going concern and then
[2:25:55.800 --> 2:25:59.160]  they came from all over the ancient world to to exchange their monies there
[2:25:59.160 --> 2:26:04.040]  yeah amazing i hope that answers doug's question
[2:26:04.040 --> 2:26:08.280]  uh let's talk to jeff in texas jeff you're on the air
[2:26:08.280 --> 2:26:12.680]  hey alex man that's uh this is really great this is my second time listening
[2:26:12.680 --> 2:26:16.360]  to you yesterday and now today and uh i feel
[2:26:16.360 --> 2:26:19.800]  pretty at home i've been actually paying attention on another level
[2:26:19.800 --> 2:26:24.600]  uh through the internet and just noticing things from the experience of my life
[2:26:24.600 --> 2:26:28.120]  i'm a reformed old hippie from the 60s so i know it all the
[2:26:28.120 --> 2:26:32.760]  culture is about and i've been around to see just what everybody's into
[2:26:32.760 --> 2:26:36.280]  but uh i think where i'm going now i've kind of developed to this point where
[2:26:36.280 --> 2:26:39.880]  what you were talking about earlier uh the electronic money
[2:26:39.880 --> 2:26:42.600]  the i mean it looks to me that put this way
[2:26:42.600 --> 2:26:46.360]  obama you know i was a bush hater when he came
[2:26:46.360 --> 2:26:49.880]  i mean i had tears now it's just like overwhelmed and just uh
[2:26:49.880 --> 2:26:53.720]  my life was just so wonderful that uh here we got a
[2:26:53.720 --> 2:26:58.520]  an african-american man as president we've come so far because i was in
[2:26:58.520 --> 2:27:02.680]  i went to my buddy's uh black weddings i was into the black culture and people
[2:27:02.680 --> 2:27:06.920]  way back when in the 60s and i lived the whole thing
[2:27:06.920 --> 2:27:10.840]  and then i started realizing the details and i was kind of in denial i think
[2:27:10.840 --> 2:27:15.480]  so many people obama six percent african and it's just a corporate
[2:27:15.480 --> 2:27:18.600]  production to sucker people that things had really
[2:27:18.600 --> 2:27:22.120]  changed when it's just more of the same but getting back to digital money
[2:27:22.120 --> 2:27:25.240]  that's why they're cracking down on swap meets on
[2:27:25.240 --> 2:27:29.720]  garage sales uh on selling your net or bartering with your neighbor
[2:27:29.720 --> 2:27:33.720]  they want everything tracked to controlled so they can turn the economy
[2:27:33.720 --> 2:27:37.560]  off uh but dealing with that and also obama
[2:27:37.560 --> 2:27:43.000]  uh and and and the fraud that was obama alan watt give us your breakdown
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:46.680]  well you'll never change the system when
[2:27:46.680 --> 2:27:51.400]  the people come in to vote to to come in and lead the same system
[2:27:51.400 --> 2:27:55.240]  of central banking international banking debt
[2:27:55.240 --> 2:27:58.760]  which is a incredible to start with since you since every
[2:27:58.760 --> 2:28:02.200]  central bank can print its own money if it wishes to but they all prefer to
[2:28:02.200 --> 2:28:04.920]  borrow from from the private banks that's the con
[2:28:04.920 --> 2:28:08.840]  everybody i don't care if you got mickey mouse coming in to run for election
[2:28:08.840 --> 2:28:13.160]  if he's going to stand up for the same system uh including all the
[2:28:13.160 --> 2:28:16.600]  previously owned debt rather than saying i'm writing it all off it's all bogus
[2:28:16.600 --> 2:28:19.560]  anyway uh we'll print our money from from now on
[2:28:19.560 --> 2:28:23.240]  debt-free but why are you voting for anybody in the first place where it was
[2:28:23.240 --> 2:28:27.800]  donald duck or anybody else it's the same system it's not your system
[2:28:27.800 --> 2:28:32.280]  it's the con system so you don't have a chance anyway voting for anybody and
[2:28:32.280 --> 2:28:35.480]  that's why they're trying to block us taking the states back because we've
[2:28:35.480 --> 2:28:39.080]  got a shot at that not really at the federal government
[2:28:39.080 --> 2:28:42.520]  yes i mean see we're already international and that was the key to
[2:28:42.520 --> 2:28:46.840]  setting up international banks and central banks as well to go with the
[2:28:46.840 --> 2:28:51.240]  the world bank and and using this this debt con
[2:28:51.240 --> 2:28:55.560]  to to push it all since world war two the u.s and britain
[2:28:55.560 --> 2:28:59.400]  and canada have been funding through their oecd department they're all set up
[2:28:59.400 --> 2:29:02.840]  during world war two across the third world we're
[2:29:02.840 --> 2:29:06.040]  we're funding china right now for their medical care

[2:35:58.440 --> 2:36:05.240]  you're on the air chris hey uh alex yes sir just making sure you can hear me
[2:36:05.240 --> 2:36:08.040]  all right here you go good to have you here
[2:36:08.040 --> 2:36:12.120]  first of all um i just want to say what you're doing is great
[2:36:12.120 --> 2:36:17.000]  uh you're a hero to us all i mean there's
[2:36:17.000 --> 2:36:21.320]  uh lots of without everything that's going on everybody calling you a crackpot
[2:36:21.320 --> 2:36:25.560]  and this and that they're they're the crackpots
[2:36:25.560 --> 2:36:28.360]  really to be quite honest well they're not intellectual they can't have a
[2:36:28.360 --> 2:36:32.200]  historical debate it's just easy to have a throwaway one-way
[2:36:32.200 --> 2:36:37.560]  line of oh your conspiracy theorist yeah you asked them a direct question and
[2:36:37.560 --> 2:36:42.360]  it's dodging dodging dodging dodging well time is on our side chris because
[2:36:42.360 --> 2:36:46.680]  i told people 12 13 14 years ago they were taking blood from babies at birth
[2:36:46.680 --> 2:36:49.960]  for the pentagon now it's admitted i told folks a year ago they're saving the
[2:36:49.960 --> 2:36:52.920]  body's cancers we have the documents i told people they were going to put
[2:36:52.920 --> 2:36:57.480]  cameras in your cars to watch you in all the airline seats to record you and
[2:36:57.480 --> 2:37:00.760]  it's all i mean look i'm going off what they say they're going to do and what
[2:37:00.760 --> 2:37:05.400]  they're doing and so i've got the facts they've got baloney
[2:37:05.400 --> 2:37:09.080]  and so the general public hears me say something a decade before they say oh
[2:37:09.080 --> 2:37:13.400]  he's a kook then they hear it later and go well that guy isn't a kook but
[2:37:13.400 --> 2:37:17.560]  any questions for all in one well yeah i have a question
[2:37:17.560 --> 2:37:21.560]  it's a couple questions and it's a either of you can feel them
[2:37:21.560 --> 2:37:25.640]  it doesn't it doesn't matter either or but uh i gotta try carefully with a
[2:37:25.640 --> 2:37:28.520]  couple of these questions because i don't want you to i i i know that you
[2:37:28.520 --> 2:37:32.600]  attacked uh i wouldn't attack but you defended yourself the other
[2:37:32.600 --> 2:37:36.520]  day and i i don't want to come off like uh i'm against you or anything so i
[2:37:36.520 --> 2:37:41.400]  just want to go if somebody is against me but but but when somebody calls in
[2:37:41.400 --> 2:37:45.480]  and just makes something up sometimes i'll get angry but at the same time
[2:37:45.480 --> 2:37:48.680]  i don't want you notice how people compliment me i say no it's all about
[2:37:48.680 --> 2:37:51.240]  you i don't want to make this about me
[2:37:51.240 --> 2:37:55.240]  number one it's dangerous number two we're going to win by waking others up
[2:37:55.240 --> 2:37:58.840]  so we're here talking about the global elite enslaving us no one can deny it
[2:37:58.840 --> 2:38:02.280]  now and so you know i don't want to make it about me
[2:38:02.280 --> 2:38:05.000]  that but listen i got a lot of callers i want to get to chris go ahead get to
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:07.000]  your points well let me hurry up
[2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:11.720]  well first i just want to say that uh i got a good judgment on uh when i meet
[2:38:11.720 --> 2:38:15.320]  people and i hear people whether or not they're decent or you know i can
[2:38:15.320 --> 2:38:18.920]  usually tell in the first few seconds of interacting with someone what kind of
[2:38:18.920 --> 2:38:22.040]  person that they are and i i get a defense that you're you know you're
[2:38:22.040 --> 2:38:26.120]  genuinely good um and you've also empowered me to do the
[2:38:26.120 --> 2:38:29.320]  same uh i do a lot of uh since since hearing
[2:38:29.320 --> 2:38:32.680]  uh things you've had to tell me information you've empowered me with
[2:38:32.680 --> 2:38:36.280]  i've gone ahead and spread that information to as many people as i
[2:38:36.280 --> 2:38:39.560]  possibly can um my question is or question one of my
[2:38:39.560 --> 2:38:42.600]  questions are do you think this can be realistically
[2:38:42.600 --> 2:38:47.000]  stopped any of all this all these things that that are on them on the move
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:50.200]  do you think any of them realistically can be stopped all right all right all
[2:38:50.200 --> 2:38:52.840]  right listen i appreciate your call i'm gonna get uh
[2:38:52.840 --> 2:38:57.480]  alan's take on what you just said he's our guest go ahead alan
[2:38:57.480 --> 2:39:03.080]  well i don't think that uh you're thinking in numbers
[2:39:03.080 --> 2:39:07.080]  uh the mass man that's how we're used in fact we're used as a mass man we're
[2:39:07.080 --> 2:39:10.920]  very predictable it's the few who change society it's
[2:39:10.920 --> 2:39:14.920]  always been that way and uh but what it means too is
[2:39:14.920 --> 2:39:20.040]  that you have to reevaluate yourself and your own values because remember
[2:39:20.040 --> 2:39:23.720]  today's values are different from 50 years ago values
[2:39:23.720 --> 2:39:28.760]  we've been totally turned upside down in fact get it back to what's what is
[2:39:28.760 --> 2:39:33.000]  personally personally sustainable that's the real meaning of sustainability
[2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:36.120]  for yourself and for those that you love
[2:39:36.120 --> 2:39:40.120]  and it really means getting back to personal values and where you can make a
[2:39:40.120 --> 2:39:43.880]  promise and keep it and even make a vow and keep it
[2:39:43.880 --> 2:39:47.400]  and get back to to your own integrity now people have no anchor
[2:39:47.400 --> 2:39:51.800]  equity they have no anchor they have no compass and then
[2:39:51.800 --> 2:39:55.880]  they'll also say i you look like a nice person you sound convincing
[2:39:55.880 --> 2:39:59.800]  it isn't my opinion that there were a riot in Atlanta
[2:39:59.800 --> 2:40:04.120]  over over uh you know food stamps and housing it's not my opinion that i
[2:40:04.120 --> 2:40:07.720]  read from the Rockefeller Foundation about vaccines to sterilize you
[2:40:07.720 --> 2:40:11.480]  it's not my opinion that bp uh you know a
[2:40:11.480 --> 2:40:17.480]  bisphenol a is is sterilizing people and causing cancer i mean again so it all
[2:40:17.480 --> 2:40:20.760]  and so the establishment always tries to make it about alex jones
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:25.480]  or about alan white folks this is information for you to make a decision
[2:40:25.480 --> 2:40:28.520]  about this isn't about i wonder what i'll do do i
[2:40:28.520 --> 2:40:31.640]  trust alex or not you shouldn't trust me
[2:40:31.640 --> 2:40:34.920]  you should go look at the information it's not about me
[2:40:34.920 --> 2:40:39.640]  i'm a guy here trying to warn people so we can stop the globalist
[2:40:39.640 --> 2:40:42.840]  and and the nothing irritates me more and i'm not mad at chris but it
[2:40:42.840 --> 2:40:45.800]  sounded like he was like building up to something he didn't go there
[2:40:45.800 --> 2:40:49.960]  about me i mean i i'm just so tired of it because
[2:40:49.960 --> 2:40:52.920]  probably half the websites out there don't fight the new world order they talk
[2:40:52.920 --> 2:40:55.800]  about alex jones because i'm the biggest thing out here doing this
[2:40:55.800 --> 2:41:01.160]  and it just shows they're malfunctioning they they they can't
[2:41:01.160 --> 2:41:04.280]  i guess they're followers i i don't understand it alan i mean i mean to get
[2:41:04.280 --> 2:41:09.560]  where i'm going with this there's a it's a backlash when you burst
[2:41:09.560 --> 2:41:12.440]  people's bubbles and people do it do within a bubble
[2:41:12.440 --> 2:41:16.520]  of comfort um they're egosyntonic because we've been given
[2:41:16.520 --> 2:41:22.040]  an egosyntonic culture an egocentric culture and a narcissistic culture
[2:41:22.040 --> 2:41:25.960]  we've also been domesticated where most folk out there truly want to believe
[2:41:25.960 --> 2:41:28.840]  they want to believe even though they're little suspicions but they want to
[2:41:28.840 --> 2:41:32.760]  believe that there are special people up there taking care of them because they
[2:41:32.760 --> 2:41:35.560]  love them and when you burst the bubble
[2:41:35.560 --> 2:41:39.240]  it takes away everything that the ground goes from underneath their feet of
[2:41:39.240 --> 2:41:42.280]  nothing to stand on that they've lived a fallacy
[2:41:42.280 --> 2:41:46.040]  and here you are telling them what the the evil things are being done to them
[2:41:46.040 --> 2:41:50.120]  and evil things are planned to them but you're using the documentation from the
[2:41:50.120 --> 2:41:52.600]  science magazines from the mainstream media
[2:41:52.600 --> 2:41:55.720]  from the big organizations and foundations involved
[2:41:55.720 --> 2:41:59.240]  but rather than look at them that what you're giving them for evidence
[2:41:59.240 --> 2:42:03.240]  they'll attack you personally that's a standard well they'll also spin it and
[2:42:03.240 --> 2:42:07.160]  say i thought the mainstream media is a bunch of liars alex
[2:42:07.160 --> 2:42:11.320]  and that's and sometimes they do lie like if they're saying rand paul say get
[2:42:11.320 --> 2:42:14.440]  rid of the civil rights act but most of the time they spin it they say
[2:42:14.440 --> 2:42:17.640]  isn't it great that the austin police department
[2:42:17.640 --> 2:42:21.800]  is putting in cameras for for sixty seventy eighty thousand dollars a piece
[2:42:21.800 --> 2:42:24.680]  no one should ask why they're ten times what they should cost
[2:42:24.680 --> 2:42:27.640]  and and and they're now using the cameras that were supposedly
[2:42:27.640 --> 2:42:32.760]  for traffic control i mean here's uh security cameras on runberg lane apd
[2:42:32.760 --> 2:42:36.120]  talks about their use uh five cameras alone will cost
[2:42:36.120 --> 2:42:39.240]  three fifty thousand dollars you know no one asked
[2:42:39.240 --> 2:42:42.600]  why did they lie to us and say they weren't for police at first they'll say
[2:42:42.600 --> 2:42:44.680]  well why are you covering mainstream news
[2:42:44.680 --> 2:42:48.360]  they're telling us how good it is i'm taking their admission and pointing out
[2:42:48.360 --> 2:42:50.280]  how it's bad
[2:42:50.280 --> 2:42:54.760]  you see i've seen the technique work before and and and i went through um
[2:42:54.760 --> 2:42:57.640]  when britain was being completely deindustrialized
[2:42:57.640 --> 2:43:01.400]  for a few years every day on the news it was one factory
[2:43:01.400 --> 2:43:04.920]  more unemployment but after the news was over
[2:43:04.920 --> 2:43:09.320]  uh you you go into a comedy show a regular comedy show
[2:43:09.320 --> 2:43:12.920]  or a tv drama so everything was okay you get this double
[2:43:12.920 --> 2:43:15.960]  mindedness and it was so bad that people were
[2:43:15.960 --> 2:43:19.080]  committing suicides britain ended up having the highest
[2:43:19.080 --> 2:43:23.320]  suicide rates in europe because um people just couldn't get jobs
[2:43:23.320 --> 2:43:27.080]  magnet thatcher came on and said a generation is growing up now who will
[2:43:27.080 --> 2:43:30.440]  never see work in their lifetimes so get used to it
[2:43:30.440 --> 2:43:34.120]  and uh i had a neighbor uh who actually hung himself
[2:43:34.120 --> 2:43:38.440]  uh so and this is happening in all the streets but no one wanted to talk about
[2:43:38.440 --> 2:43:42.120]  it they went into a self-protective mode
[2:43:42.120 --> 2:43:44.840]  didn't want to to to listen to anything negative at all
[2:43:44.840 --> 2:43:48.840]  it was almost as though they would catch unemployment by talking about it
[2:43:48.840 --> 2:43:52.520]  because i catch a bullet diseases oh yeah i get that all the time don't talk
[2:43:52.520 --> 2:43:56.520]  about dollar devaluation don't talk about global depression when all the
[2:43:56.520 --> 2:43:58.760]  major think tanks admit they're engineering it
[2:43:58.760 --> 2:44:02.760]  because i'm gonna cause it by being negative alan yeah i'm supposed to
[2:44:02.760 --> 2:44:06.040]  just love nafta and gad i got right
[2:44:06.040 --> 2:44:10.360]  yeah and of course the whole new age religion that's been put out there too
[2:44:10.360 --> 2:44:15.160]  and remember too yeah the secret you're supposed to imagine positive things and
[2:44:15.160 --> 2:44:18.600]  you get it yeah that's right and remember too it was the
[2:44:18.600 --> 2:44:21.800]  it was a the Scottish writer free masonry's own journal that came out in
[2:44:21.800 --> 2:44:25.720]  the 1950s saying that they would bring in the new age
[2:44:25.720 --> 2:44:28.680]  and that was that was the name in fact of their journal that eventually they
[2:44:28.680 --> 2:44:32.440]  changed it there were monthly magazine and they said they created a new type
[2:44:32.440 --> 2:44:36.120]  of religion and that ties in at the same time as as you find
[2:44:36.120 --> 2:44:39.560]  Russell was publishing his books talking about bringing
[2:44:39.560 --> 2:44:44.520]  in an egocentric culture that would just love themselves it's all about me
[2:44:44.520 --> 2:44:47.640]  and narcissism which would split them off from being
[2:44:47.640 --> 2:44:51.160]  being family groups and so on everyone would be into their own
[2:44:51.160 --> 2:44:55.000]  mirror image of themselves and by the way their lives we're going back to calls
[2:44:55.000 --> 2:44:58.280]  but well said alan what the way i describe narcissism
[2:44:58.280 --> 2:45:02.040]  is i stopped being a narcissist at about age three which is normal for a small
[2:45:02.040 --> 2:45:04.680]  child to be narcissistic you know they're learning about themselves their
[2:45:04.680 --> 2:45:08.680]  identity but i noticed other children would do play
[2:45:08.680 --> 2:45:12.200]  games they'd be batman they'd be robin they'd be the hulk
[2:45:12.200 --> 2:45:17.240]  and i figured out this is a game this isn't real it's like dress up like
[2:45:17.240 --> 2:45:19.080]  girls dressing up when they're five years old to be
[2:45:19.080 --> 2:45:22.120]  princess and i realize now when i watch yuppies and
[2:45:22.120 --> 2:45:26.360]  adults they're all in their own little dress up world their own
[2:45:26.360 --> 2:45:29.240]  little they're walking around on delusional
[2:45:29.240 --> 2:45:33.480]  power trips and they buy whatever the media tells them to get as the trink
[2:45:33.480 --> 2:45:37.240]  the trinkets and the uniform of that and you try to talk to them
[2:45:37.240 --> 2:45:40.920]  and they're not there and they'll do this little enjoyment smile
[2:45:40.920 --> 2:45:44.120]  of like i'm better than you and if you try to talk to them
[2:45:44.120 --> 2:45:48.680]  they take it as your week you know and and and they walk around and act tough
[2:45:48.680 --> 2:45:51.880]  and ignore people it's kind of like junior high with the cool kids
[2:45:51.880 --> 2:45:55.960]  and they're just pathetic jellyfish losers who can't even see the
[2:45:55.960 --> 2:46:00.360]  the galactic space they're in with all the wonderment and magic
[2:46:00.360 --> 2:46:05.160]  i mean they just they're just blobs i they're incredible scum
[2:46:05.160 --> 2:46:09.960]  you know what you what you're looking at too is the cult of celebrity
[2:46:09.960 --> 2:46:14.520]  has been risen to an amazing new heights and and people follow them
[2:46:14.520 --> 2:46:18.600]  religiously and they copy the the fashions they copy the actors they copy
[2:46:18.600 --> 2:46:21.800]  the lifestyles as best they can according to their budget
[2:46:21.800 --> 2:46:25.640]  and and in their fantasy little world where they have no power at all
[2:46:25.640 --> 2:46:29.080]  they feel they have power in this fantasy world it's no different than a
[2:46:29.080 --> 2:46:32.840]  driver today an average guy who feels powerless gets behind
[2:46:32.840 --> 2:46:35.480]  a wheel and suddenly he's the king of the road
[2:46:35.480 --> 2:46:38.600]  and because it's only place he feels he's got any power
[2:46:38.600 --> 2:46:42.440]  it's the same thing with the little dream world of narcissism well as most
[2:46:42.440 --> 2:46:45.960]  folks secretly know that they are technically powerless
[2:46:45.960 --> 2:46:49.560]  and they would become powerful they would admit the matrix and wake up
[2:46:49.560 --> 2:46:52.360]  but they believe they have power within the matrix
[2:46:52.360 --> 2:46:55.560]  and now you have people spending hundreds of thousands of dollars
[2:46:55.560 --> 2:47:01.480]  in the simulation online games to buy houses and cars and real things then
[2:47:01.480 --> 2:47:04.040]  they have real world relationships and parties
[2:47:04.040 --> 2:47:07.880]  where people show up and they go he's the movie director
[2:47:07.880 --> 2:47:12.440]  you know in this online fiction game and people are groveling to it
[2:47:12.440 --> 2:47:16.120]  yes and that shows you the incredible brain damage that they have and I
[2:47:16.120 --> 2:47:19.000]  really mean that people do have brain damage
[2:47:19.000 --> 2:47:23.080]  from their inoculations and from their food there has been a covert war
[2:47:23.080 --> 2:47:29.000]  you're seeing the end product of it now the IQ has officially dropped
[2:47:29.000 --> 2:47:32.040]  and it's been admitted by the United Nations
[2:47:32.040 --> 2:47:35.080]  in the western world they say 10 points but they've changed the test they're
[2:47:35.080 --> 2:47:38.840]  skewing it what more like 20 that's right and therefore
[2:47:38.840 --> 2:47:43.160]  your ability for self-preservation which is an essential part of warfare you
[2:47:43.160 --> 2:47:46.520]  must destroy that part and an enemy if you want to take them down
[2:47:46.520 --> 2:47:50.600]  they have been doing it quietly covertly in fact again brzezinski and other
[2:47:50.600 --> 2:47:53.640]  ones and even muscle two came out and said that this will
[2:47:53.640 --> 2:47:56.600]  happen to the public they won't know where their
[2:47:56.600 --> 2:47:59.320]  opinions are coming from the technotronic age
[2:47:59.320 --> 2:48:03.320]  where they're just mindless vessels to be filled
[2:48:03.320 --> 2:48:06.920]  and where they have no initiative no nothing they don't even understand
[2:48:06.920 --> 2:48:10.440]  they're in the middle of a war they're just running around feeling cool it's
[2:48:10.440 --> 2:48:13.480]  like guys that wear all the affliction wear
[2:48:13.480 --> 2:48:17.400]  you know what Russell actually said Russell actually said that
[2:48:17.400 --> 2:48:21.080]  eventually because of these techniques and he meant covert techniques they
[2:48:21.080 --> 2:48:23.880]  would never tell you what they were doing to you in reality
[2:48:23.880 --> 2:48:28.440]  he said eventually the thought of rebellion will be as foreign to them
[2:48:28.440 --> 2:48:32.520]  and it's an impossible as sheep complaining about the the place in
[2:48:32.520 --> 2:48:35.320]  mutton exactly but but the point is i'm not
[2:48:35.320 --> 2:48:39.160]  against the gladiatorial stuff for the guys that want to be tough but i've
[2:48:39.160 --> 2:48:43.640]  talked to bar owners and people they won't even let folks in with the ufc
[2:48:43.640 --> 2:48:47.480]  clothes uh or or the affliction stuff because
[2:48:47.480 --> 2:48:50.840]  it's like they put it on and now they're an ultimate fighter and they're just
[2:48:50.840 --> 2:48:54.280]  crazed running around feeling tough that's another
[2:48:54.280 --> 2:48:57.960]  microcosm example mm-hmm yes absolutely
[2:48:57.960 --> 2:49:01.400]  again it's the cult of celebrity they said they would do this
[2:49:01.400 --> 2:49:06.520]  and uh the celebrity people follow them so meticulously and religiously
[2:49:06.520 --> 2:49:10.120]  and try to become them remember Plato said the same thing
[2:49:10.120 --> 2:49:13.160]  that they they will use and he said that in these terms
[2:49:13.160 --> 2:49:18.680]  he said the fashion industry the drama or or or entertainment in his sports
[2:49:18.680 --> 2:49:21.800]  it's a big end sports is a big part because the people
[2:49:21.800 --> 2:49:25.640]  emulate what they see the actors doing let's jam in one more call for a
[2:49:25.640 --> 2:49:27.960]  little break and come back uh let's talk to stand in
[2:49:27.960 --> 2:49:33.000]  Ohio you're on the air with alan watt i was going guys good
[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:37.320]  uh i was wondering if i could get both your takes on proposition 19
[2:49:37.320 --> 2:49:43.160]  for california you guys know about that one uh yes but fill folks in briefly
[2:49:43.160 --> 2:49:46.760]  all right yeah that's the legalization of marijuana act
[2:49:46.760 --> 2:49:50.120]  that's being proposed for november i'm against the drug war
[2:49:50.120 --> 2:49:54.200]  because they launder the money but now they're going to quasi legalize
[2:49:54.200 --> 2:49:57.880]  certain drugs because they're unable to control the black market so they can
[2:49:57.880 --> 2:50:01.800]  tax it and control it alan watt that's part of it but now it's
[2:50:01.800 --> 2:50:07.160]  time as well to use all drugs i mean you could have the population on the
[2:50:07.160 --> 2:50:11.160]  psychoactive drugs or valium types of tranquilizers anyway
[2:50:11.160 --> 2:50:14.760]  so they want the public to be very tranquil as it goes through these
[2:50:14.760 --> 2:50:18.280]  massive changes and by any means possible so they don't really care what
[2:50:18.280 --> 2:50:20.920]  you're taking yeah that's why soros is funding
[2:50:20.920 --> 2:50:24.680]  legalization of marijuana he isn't doing it to stop the police state
[2:50:24.680 --> 2:50:27.320]  he's doing because he wants you stoned out of your mind
[2:50:27.320 --> 2:50:30.520]  mm-hmm but yeah
[2:50:30.520 --> 2:50:33.560]  and i'm not bashing the whole weedhead community but come on folks you're not
[2:50:33.560 --> 2:50:36.840]  leading to charge up a hill when you've been smoking dope

[2:54:26.760 --> 2:54:29.720]  they're bragging they're doing it they're adding to the vaccines i've got all
[2:54:29.720 --> 2:54:32.920]  their documents i read them on air had links right to the rockefeller
[2:54:32.920 --> 2:54:37.000]  foundation they're not playing games and people

[2:54:46.920 --> 2:54:50.120]  well and i'm not talking to my general audience but some of the new listeners
[2:54:50.120 --> 2:54:52.840]  out there look we've been right about everything we've
[2:54:52.840 --> 2:54:55.400]  covered unfortunately we're going to be right about the future we have the
[2:54:55.400 --> 2:54:58.680]  globalist on blueprints it's time to wake up folks you're not in
[2:54:58.680 --> 2:55:02.360]  kansas anymore uh let's talk to guy in new jersey
[2:55:02.360 --> 2:55:05.160]  you're on the air with alan watt quick question placer
[2:55:05.160 --> 2:55:08.600]  all right i have a quick uh thing i want to say everyone needs to go to google
[2:55:08.600 --> 2:55:12.600]  right away and google vending machines of the future just came out on fox news
[2:55:12.600 --> 2:55:16.200]  that they installed 16 new vending machines all over the country
[2:55:16.200 --> 2:55:20.200]  that are going to have biometric scans on them for your thumb print they say
[2:55:20.200 --> 2:55:23.480]  after 2011 they're going to try and enforce it for them to have the
[2:55:23.480 --> 2:55:27.160]  watch and wrote a story about this a month ago uh dealing with the mark of
[2:55:27.160 --> 2:55:30.920]  the beast and you have to thumb print face scan swap your license and it's
[2:55:30.920 --> 2:55:34.120]  going to be for all purchases they'll only be security guards this is the
[2:55:34.120 --> 2:55:37.720]  official plan in the shopping malls in the grocery stores
[2:55:37.720 --> 2:55:43.000]  the the entire checkout container will be a scanner alan watt
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:47.480]  yes that because the idea is that no one is supposed to escape this whole new
[2:55:47.480 --> 2:55:52.600]  system of surveillance eventually it'll be impossible to go go anywhere
[2:55:52.600 --> 2:55:56.040]  without your your proper security card or even the chip
[2:55:56.040 --> 2:56:00.760]  it's like a 1040 it's like a 1040 now for $600 things you buy with other
[2:56:00.760 --> 2:56:04.760]  businesses you got to report to the irs now everything's going to have rfid
[2:56:04.760 --> 2:56:09.000]  and the whole history of that pair of shoes will be tracked go ahead alan
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:12.040]  and not only that not only that though they've talked about putting your
[2:56:12.040 --> 2:56:16.680]  all your inoculation records on that chip and one day you'll walk into a store
[2:56:16.680 --> 2:56:20.440]  and if you're not up to date with something alarm bells will go off and
[2:56:20.440 --> 2:56:23.800]  the cops will grab you immediately and drag you off to the cell that's already
[2:56:23.800 --> 2:56:27.000]  begun i mean they admit it's to track yet of course
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:31.000]  yeah so this is this is a a system a complete system that's what i mean but
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:34.840]  there's no choices in this system it's either their their way or no way
[2:56:34.840 --> 2:56:38.600]  and they want to make sure that no one can survive outside their system
[2:56:38.600 --> 2:56:42.040]  that this war has been grown for thousands of years
[2:56:42.040 --> 2:56:45.720]  to destroy complete independence and now it's coming to a head
[2:56:45.720 --> 2:56:48.840]  guide great points that was in my stack i meant to get to it today
[2:56:48.840 --> 2:56:52.680]  but here's an example nationwide they had this 15 years ago
[2:56:52.680 --> 2:56:56.920]  i had the ceo on they've got face scanning cameras off your driver's license
[2:56:56.920 --> 2:57:00.360]  image they buy at kiosk in malls and airports and on the
[2:57:00.360 --> 2:57:04.440]  street and as you walk by it says alex jones we've got your size shoes here
[2:57:04.440 --> 2:57:07.720]  you know come in and get it but that's only to pay for the surveillance
[2:57:07.720 --> 2:57:11.400]  the real business of those companies is selling your whereabouts and your data
[2:57:11.400 --> 2:57:14.680]  just like target and walmart and and and people
[2:57:14.680 --> 2:57:19.320]  they're selling all that data so they fund your enslavement
[2:57:19.320 --> 2:57:22.920]  with the system go ahead alan that's right too
[2:57:22.920 --> 2:57:26.440]  it's it's an easy trick to do is to entice people
[2:57:26.440 --> 2:57:30.360]  and to this is free this is that's free just put up all your details here and
[2:57:30.360 --> 2:57:33.960]  use the system and we all we've had that with with facebook the guy had it
[2:57:33.960 --> 2:57:37.320]  right from the beginning he was going to sell the data and all the idiots went
[2:57:37.320 --> 2:57:40.040]  and joined up for him he called them idiots a bunch of dumb
[2:57:40.040 --> 2:57:44.040]  efforts he did he did absolutely but they won't they won't stop them because
[2:57:44.040 --> 2:57:47.320]  the next one i'll come out we'll join that oh no they say it's a conspiracy
[2:57:47.320 --> 2:57:49.720]  theory that facebook sells your data to the government
[2:57:49.720 --> 2:57:53.400]  they attack us alan even as he's calling him dumb scum
[2:57:53.400 --> 2:57:58.200]  they're like yes we are dumb scum we love you yeah because all their friends are
[2:57:58.200 --> 2:58:01.000]  on facebook see all their friends you see
[2:58:01.000 --> 2:58:04.760]  once again you're bursting their bubble and so you will be attacked for doing
[2:58:04.760 --> 2:58:08.120]  so and again too see most folk today are in majority
[2:58:08.120 --> 2:58:11.240]  think if the rest all think this way then that's the way it must be
[2:58:11.240 --> 2:58:15.240]  alan and everyone else is is quite happy with it so what what's your problem
[2:58:15.240 --> 2:58:17.640]  yeah people are happy with their five-year-olds going into puberty and
[2:58:17.640 --> 2:58:22.280]  getting breast cancer at 15 it's good it's fun it's loving medicine will take

[2:58:49.320 --> 2:58:53.400]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[2:58:53.400 --> 2:58:57.080]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[2:58:57.080 --> 2:59:00.760]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[2:59:00.760 --> 2:59:04.920]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[2:59:04.920 --> 2:59:08.600]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[2:59:08.600 --> 2:59:13.080]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[2:59:13.080 --> 2:59:16.920]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[2:59:16.920 --> 2:59:20.520]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[2:59:20.520 --> 2:59:24.440]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[2:59:24.440 --> 2:59:27.880]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[2:59:27.880 --> 2:59:31.080]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my old
