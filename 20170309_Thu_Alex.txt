[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  We've got a long way to go and there's a short time to get there, time is kind of what
[00:15.000 --> 00:16.000]  a bandit runs.
[00:16.000 --> 00:18.000]  Give me liberty or give me death.
[00:18.000 --> 00:19.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:19.000 --> 00:20.000]  Let it all hang out cause we gotta run to big.
[00:20.000 --> 00:29.000]  The boys are thirsty in Atlanta and their spirit takes our count.
[00:29.000 --> 00:32.000]  We are from deep in the heart of Texas Austin Broadcasting Worldwide.
[00:32.000 --> 00:33.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:33.000 --> 00:35.000]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:35.000 --> 00:36.000]  Wow.
[00:36.000 --> 00:38.000]  A lot to cover as usual and then some.
[00:38.000 --> 00:41.000]  It's already Thursday, the 9th day of March 2017.
[00:41.000 --> 00:44.000]  We'll be here for the next four hours.
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  A lot of special guests as well and John Rebeport coming up.
[00:48.000 --> 00:54.000]  Just look at these headlines from InfoWars.com but also DrudgeReport.com.
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.000]  And most of this is from the establishment themselves.
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  It's not like we're putting it through some filter.
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.000]  The Pope slams evil populism and says nation states are evil.
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  Well, he said that before.
[01:10.000 --> 01:16.000]  Last year he said that it disgusts him to hear about Christian roots in Europe and that basically
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  Islam should replace it.
[01:18.000 --> 01:26.000]  He really said that because the globalists have made this deal with the billion plus
[01:26.000 --> 01:32.000]  Muslims bordering Europe to end Western civilization.
[01:32.000 --> 01:40.000]  Using Islam as a sabotage, a cultural virus program.
[01:40.000 --> 01:43.000]  Stephen Hawking's come out and called for world government.
[01:43.000 --> 01:46.000]  Oh yes, to keep us safe.
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  But of course it's the people pushing world government, the actual ones pushing us towards
[01:50.000 --> 01:51.000]  total destruction.
[01:51.000 --> 01:52.000]  That's the problem, isn't it?
[01:52.000 --> 01:55.000]  Hawking, he goes on to pretty much admit that.
[01:55.000 --> 02:00.000]  Then we've got Facebook admitting, oh, what we're really all about is predicting the future
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.000]  and controlling the future by manipulating mass movements.
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.000]  Yeah, you want self-driving cars that the CIA can hack and kill people with.
[02:08.000 --> 02:16.000]  But you also want self-driving humanity manipulated by stimuli, mind control.
[02:16.000 --> 02:22.000]  I told you 10 years ago that Google and Facebook, Facebook hadn't even come out yet, were all about
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  steering the future because, well, I was actually more than 10 years ago, but I've been harping
[02:26.000 --> 02:27.000]  on it for 10 years.
[02:27.000 --> 02:33.000]  I was told 18 years ago by multiple NSA whistleblowers, face to face.
[02:33.000 --> 02:37.000]  Like something out of a movie we're in a parking garage or in a rodeo.
[02:37.000 --> 02:38.000]  They're like, listen to me.
[02:38.000 --> 02:40.000]  It's about controlling the future and manipulating with data.
[02:40.000 --> 02:41.000]  And they've almost got it together.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  And once they've got that, it's the end of free will.
[02:43.000 --> 02:44.000]  That's the plan.
[02:44.000 --> 02:45.000]  It's a total takeover.
[02:45.000 --> 02:48.000]  And they plan to merge with machines, Alex, and you've got to sell everybody.
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.000]  And then it's true.
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  Eric Schmidt, big data is so powerful, nation states will fight over it.
[02:56.000 --> 02:57.000]  Business Insider.
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  It's all coming up today.
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  But Pope Francis issues warning about Donald Trump.
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.000]  Populism is evil.
[03:06.000 --> 03:12.000]  He sits there in the middle of Italy and that burgeoning populist country with all their
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.000]  inventions and style and the rest of it bitching about the West constantly.
[03:17.000 --> 03:18.000]  What a scumbag.
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.000]  But again, they've made the calculations.
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  He's behind 200 foot walls, the Vatican, some are even bigger.
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  The average is 50 feet.
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  He's not taking any refugees in, but he wants you to, because he can use the third world
[03:29.000 --> 03:30.000]  as a giant weapon system.
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  Let's go to DrudgeReport.com.
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.000]  Ramos, you know, the big international TV star of Latin America.
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  Oh yeah, mainstream media in the U.S. doesn't have any viewers.
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  This guy's got hundreds of millions of viewers.
[03:43.000 --> 03:46.000]  Ramos, whites will become minority.
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  This is our country.
[03:48.000 --> 03:56.000]  What an incredibly racist statement, but it's also an attempt to defraud anyone that is,
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  quote, Hispanic from ever having part in the American dream.
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.000]  They want to keep you under third world control.
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.000]  And I love how Tucker Carlson comes back.
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.000]  He goes, dude, you're wider than I am.
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  Oh yeah, you go to Latin America.
[04:08.000 --> 04:13.000]  Every country, the ruling class, unless it's Venezuela, are like six foot four white guys.
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.000]  In fact, go look at photos of the Mexican Congress.
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  It looks wider than someplace in West Texas.
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  It's such a racist culture against anybody with color in Latin America.
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  They never got out of colonialism.
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  Super racist towards black people.
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.000]  But again, Americans are ignorant culturally, no matter what color we are, and we're just so stupid.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  I mean, it's like what Obama landed in Cuba.
[04:38.000 --> 04:44.000]  They were calling him, you know, the black man and the black bird and the Mayada and all this horrible racist crap.
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  Because that's what Cuba's like.
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  Super race based.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  It's, I mean, the whole world's tribal like this.
[04:50.000 --> 04:53.000]  And Ramos is just pushing race based garbage.
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  The guy's a Hispanic KKK member in my view.
[04:56.000 --> 05:08.000]  We'll be back.
[05:26.000 --> 05:33.000]  She's a satanic witch, but the greedy archdiocese of LA claims it is theirs to sell and they want to sell it to Perry for the exorbitant price.
[05:33.000 --> 05:42.000]  Perry tried to play coy with the sisters, saying she has a Jesus tattoo, but they called her out on her other tattoos, her performances and her attendance at a Salem witch walk, which conveniently she couldn't recall.
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  They also brought up this statement from Perry.
[05:44.000 --> 05:48.000]  I want it to be like the Amy Grand of music, but it didn't work out.
[05:48.000 --> 05:51.000]  And so I sold my soul to the devil.
[05:51.000 --> 06:00.000]  This case has now reached the highest legal authorities in the Catholic church. Guess we will see where their loyalties lie for info wars.com. This is Owen shroyer.
[06:00.000 --> 06:02.000]  Today we call it bone broth.
[06:02.000 --> 06:09.000]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[06:09.000 --> 06:12.000]  We are now introducing caveman by info wars live.com.

[06:27.000 --> 06:30.000]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[06:30.000 --> 06:33.000]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[06:33.000 --> 06:43.000]  You use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength from the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[06:43.000 --> 06:46.000]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[06:46.000 --> 06:53.000]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were.
[06:53.000 --> 06:54.000]  And this is a big part of it.

[08:24.000 --> 08:32.000]  It's Thursday or in the old English the day of four already the 9th of March 2017.
[08:32.000 --> 08:43.000]  I'm Alex Jones your host coming to you from the lone star state and I'm right smack dab in the physical but also the cultural heart of America.
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[08:45.000 --> 08:48.000]  We're not coming to you from New York or LA or DC.
[08:48.000 --> 08:54.000]  Great places great people but that's where the elites are where Trump has identified the problems are coming from.
[08:54.000 --> 09:06.000]  We're right here in the heartland battling to restore the Republic broadcasting worldwide with giant audiences from Japan to Russia to the UK to South Africa to Latin America to the Pacific.
[09:06.000 --> 09:07.000]  You name it.
[09:07.000 --> 09:14.000]  I can be in Central America or I can be in Hawaii and I get mob by listeners and viewers and I don't say that to act powerful.
[09:14.000 --> 09:20.000]  It's exciting to know that freedom is so incredibly popular.
[09:20.000 --> 09:35.000]  Now drudge report.com if you're a radio listener everybody knows what it is pretty much the biggest website in the world biggest news site in the world hands down just knows how to paint a picture with a palette of mainstream news.
[09:35.000 --> 09:46.000]  Government news press releases alternative news and new media photos documents press releases arrest warrants you name it.
[09:46.000 --> 09:52.000]  And it says it all bowling for votes how Trump is charming.
[09:52.000 --> 09:58.000]  Congress even working when he plays golf maybe once every two weeks when he has a world leader visiting.
[09:58.000 --> 10:07.000]  Now he's up even late at night with folks inside the White House at the bowling alley that the White House has the Harry S Truman bowling alley.
[10:07.000 --> 10:15.000]  He's taking action and then beneath it wiki to provide tech firms access to CIA hacking details.
[10:15.000 --> 10:23.000]  That's right so they can know how to fix their systems from the illegal hacking that the rogue out of control central intelligence agencies up to.
[10:23.000 --> 10:30.000]  And then we've also got sentiment about economy strongest in 16 years Pope slams.
[10:30.000 --> 10:43.000]  Evil populism yes he actually says having a country is evil that's what Glenn Beck said two weeks ago I'm seeing any said it's horrible it's dangerous this nationalism just having a country now is politically incorrect.
[10:43.000 --> 10:53.000]  And then right below it you've got the just the I mean if I was a Hollywood producer and I was making a house of a thousand corpses or devils rejects.
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.000]  Or you know some other powerful Rob Zombie movie.
[10:57.000 --> 11:01.000]  I would go get Hillary to kind of be the lady that runs the mortuary.
[11:01.000 --> 11:07.000]  Not just her actions and stealing two billion from the Haitians and everything else but the way she looks we get a close up of that.
[11:07.000 --> 11:11.000]  I mean just just look at it.
[11:11.000 --> 11:23.000]  She looks like a ghoul and in every photo you look at her she looks more and more ghoulish and evil but then the book cover actually matches what's inside.
[11:23.000 --> 11:32.000]  Gender swap experiment shows Hillary even less likeable as a man tell me something I don't know.
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  Tell me something I wasn't aware of.
[11:36.000 --> 11:44.000]  Oh and then over here on the right hand side the really big news or the left hand side of Drudge Trump sends B 52s to South Korea.
[11:44.000 --> 11:51.000]  We're gonna get to that in a moment with nuclear bombs.
[11:51.000 --> 11:56.000]  And look at this nuns go to war with Katy Perry.
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.000]  Over witchcraft.
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  Sold souls to the devil she says.
[12:04.000 --> 12:07.000]  What's going on from there.
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  Now let's talk about this together.
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.000]  Every time I talk about Katy Perry or Lady Gaga doing a satanic ritual on TV.
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.000]  They have national news headlines saying I'm insane.
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  I'm making up that witchcraft is taking place.
[12:22.000 --> 12:30.000]  Whether you believe in the devil or you believe in the occult or whether you have a Christian view whatever this is going on.
[12:30.000 --> 12:41.000]  And when you watch the Super Bowl events or you watch the MTV events or you watch the Grammys or the Emmys they are chopped full of everything from classical satanism black magic.
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.000]  To Egyptian occultic stuff it just runs the gamut.
[12:46.000 --> 12:53.000]  I've covered skull and bones I'm the only person ever sneak into Bohemian Grove and actually get out with the footage without being arrested.
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  Or later set up and indicted by the grace of God.
[12:55.000 --> 12:59.000]  Oh yeah they've really put people in prison that have stuck in there.
[12:59.000 --> 13:00.000]  God they go set you up.
[13:00.000 --> 13:01.000]  I mean it's pretty hardcore.
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.000]  But the point is we've been protected by God.
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  I don't believe I know.
[13:06.000 --> 13:10.000]  And so Katy Perry and all these people are into witchcraft.
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  You know I know Katy Perry's dad.
[13:12.000 --> 13:13.000]  He's a preacher.
[13:13.000 --> 13:14.000]  He's talked about it.
[13:14.000 --> 13:20.000]  Katy Perry used to listen to the show.
[13:20.000 --> 13:29.000]  Katy Perry is fully fully aware of what she's doing and what she's up to.
[13:29.000 --> 13:35.000]  And that you supposedly get power in this world if you tip your hat to the devil if you kiss the ring.
[13:35.000 --> 13:39.000]  I guess Pope Francis would be the greatest incarnation of satan I could ever imagine.
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  Christianity's bad.
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  Nationalism's bad.
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  Christian roots of Europe's bad.
[13:45.000 --> 13:51.000]  I mean whoa thank you for being honest.
[13:51.000 --> 13:52.000]  The great serpent.
[13:52.000 --> 13:53.000]  The devil.
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  The morning star.
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  Pope Francis is the new name of the devil.
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  But even two weeks ago it was on CNN.
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.000]  It was all over the newspapers.
[14:03.000 --> 14:04.000]  It was all over Rolling Stone.
[14:04.000 --> 14:14.000]  All these rock stars and music stars were all saying we're going to do black magic to kill Trump and turn him to ashes and all those other made up crap.
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  And then they had right wing watch and stuff going.
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  Jones is insane.
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  He believes that they're announcing this.
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  See they play these games.
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.000]  So they want to make you feel powerless.
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.000]  They want to throw stuff out but also deny it.
[14:32.000 --> 14:33.000]  Try to make you just give up.
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  It's not going to work.
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  They're so arrogant and so delusional.
[14:37.000 --> 14:45.000]  They tried to sell a daughtering corrupt evil woman that almost everyone hated in the election.
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.000]  They tried to steal it.
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  They did steal at least five states.
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  Tried to steal six others.
[14:50.000 --> 14:55.000]  The poll numbers were Trump was winning by 15 points in real scientific polls.
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  I told you that you saw it happen but they still tried to steal it.
[14:58.000 --> 15:12.000]  But it was such a defeat, such a massive rejection that they had to back off for a while and thought we'll just discredit this populist movement, this nationalist movement by demonizing Trump.
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.000]  Oh and Le Pen and everybody else and Wilders, you can't do it.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  So when I get up here and say we're winning, you can't win.
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  The tide of globalism is going out.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  Your system is in deep trouble.
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  It's been identified.
[15:25.000 --> 15:26.000]  You're not operating in the shadows anymore.
[15:26.000 --> 15:36.000]  Your mind trick of saying corporate world government tax exempt, diplomatically immune groups, your trick of saying that doesn't exist is over.
[15:36.000 --> 15:45.000]  So now the Financial Times of London and the New York Times and every other major globalist publication every day says world governments in crisis are programs in trouble.
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  What do we do?
[15:46.000 --> 15:52.000]  And they have open discussions in more elite publications like Atlantic Monthly in Places.
[15:52.000 --> 15:57.000]  Do we plunge the economy and have economic war with the population to make them submit?
[15:57.000 --> 16:02.000]  Or do we go to more oppressive algorithms and systems of control on the web to shut them down?
[16:02.000 --> 16:07.000]  Or do we, and the answer is don't go with the economic warfare.
[16:07.000 --> 16:09.000]  They've already tried to plunge the economy.
[16:09.000 --> 16:10.000]  That didn't work.
[16:10.000 --> 16:14.000]  So now they're saying we'll just go with shutting the free internet off as we know it.
[16:14.000 --> 16:17.000]  And so now it's basically moving at warp speed.
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.000]  Normal censorship creeps in over the years.
[16:20.000 --> 16:26.000]  Every week they're ratcheting on Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, all the major platforms.
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  It's happening. I have a stack of news today.
[16:28.000 --> 16:44.000]  I mean, there are articles that Facebook won't let you share because there's new intelligence committee reports and the FBI's come out and said there's no evidence of anything Russian in the election.
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  And we try to share that.
[16:46.000 --> 16:47.000]  It won't let us.
[16:47.000 --> 16:49.000]  Or it'll block you from sharing it.
[16:49.000 --> 16:54.000]  Not because it's fake news, but because it's credible, documented news.
[16:54.000 --> 16:58.000]  They wouldn't let us share the Rand Paul interview a few days ago when the senator came on.
[16:58.000 --> 16:59.000]  Facebook deleted that.
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.000]  They wouldn't let us share one with the former CIA section chief saying that, no, I've talked to my colleagues.
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.000]  They were ordered to target Trump and the populist.
[17:07.000 --> 17:09.000]  The globalists think you're so dumb, though.
[17:09.000 --> 17:15.000]  They're in major newspapers saying we're targeting populism.
[17:15.000 --> 17:16.000]  We're targeting the nation state.
[17:16.000 --> 17:19.000]  We're targeting populations that don't want to be under our globalism.
[17:19.000 --> 17:26.000]  I mean, I've seen, let me not exaggerate, 300 articles the last few months from the Washington Post, the financial times.
[17:26.000 --> 17:27.000]  You've all seen them.
[17:27.000 --> 17:28.000]  Globalism and crisis.
[17:28.000 --> 17:29.000]  How do we stop it?
[17:29.000 --> 17:36.000]  Well, we just shut down the free speech of the people and we fund ethnic warfare and we fund balkanization.
[17:36.000 --> 17:40.000]  So the peoples of the nations never come together and say, we all want private property.
[17:40.000 --> 17:57.000]  We all want low taxes. We all want to be able to live in peace without the so-called social engineer liberals telling us we're all multicultural and then teaching us how to fight with each other and having George Ramos come out on the television network.
[17:57.000 --> 17:59.000]  He's on that broadcast all over Latin America.
[17:59.000 --> 18:03.000]  I was looking at that guy's over 100 million viewers a week conservatively.
[18:03.000 --> 18:04.000]  RMSM's dead.
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  Their top shows a couple of millions.
[18:06.000 --> 18:16.000]  This guy is a superstar and he's super nasty and he's there to make sure the 780 million people in Latin America stay peasants.
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  Pions in his words.
[18:18.000 --> 18:23.000]  Making sure you sit there and you never get a chance at the free market.
[18:23.000 --> 18:25.000]  You never get a chance at your own company.
[18:25.000 --> 18:27.000]  You never get a chance at the American dream.
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.000]  Make sure that American dream is run into the ground just like WikiLeaks says.
[18:30.000 --> 18:35.000]  The Democrats are in there going, we got to keep our constituents poor and desperate and in the dark.
[18:35.000 --> 18:36.000]  And it's not working.
[18:36.000 --> 18:37.000]  So what do we do?
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  Pull those up.
[18:40.000 --> 18:41.000]  Keep people in the dark.
[18:41.000 --> 18:42.000]  Keep them desperate.
[18:42.000 --> 18:48.000]  We've got to use cultural war and inner Jorge Ramos.
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  Let's get this break.
[18:50.000 --> 18:57.000]  I'm going to hit this first because he goes on Tucker Carlson's show.
[18:57.000 --> 19:02.000]  And Carlson is breaking down the facts and Ramos is like, listen, you're not going to control your borders.
[19:02.000 --> 19:05.000]  This is our country, Hispanics country.
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.000]  Well, wait a minute.
[19:06.000 --> 19:11.000]  Mexico has a diverse population, but it's mainly, quote, people that you would say are,
[19:11.000 --> 19:18.000]  I guess it goes back to Hispaniola, the island of Hispaniola, Spanish, a mixture of cultures, colonialism.
[19:18.000 --> 19:21.000]  I mean, he probably doesn't even know the whole background of this stuff.
[19:21.000 --> 19:24.000]  But it's just, okay, so you represent Hispanics.
[19:24.000 --> 19:28.000]  No, you represent the white elites that still control Latin America.
[19:28.000 --> 19:29.000]  That's who you represent.
[19:29.000 --> 19:39.000]  The most controlled centralized place in the world, other than China or North Korea, with a class system of elites, is Mexico.
[19:39.000 --> 19:44.000]  Mexico has some massive wealth, some of the biggest groups of billionaires in the world.
[19:44.000 --> 19:49.000]  And their expert at making sure their people don't ever get enough money to shut up their own system.
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  It's all game to keep people poor.
[19:51.000 --> 19:56.000]  And that's what the colonial and feudal system is.
[19:56.000 --> 19:57.000]  That's where it is.
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.000]  And America was about breaking that.
[19:59.000 --> 20:03.000]  Doesn't mean we have a perfect history, because we were coming out of all that.
[20:03.000 --> 20:08.000]  But George Ramos, whites will become a minority.
[20:08.000 --> 20:09.000]  This is our country.
[20:09.000 --> 20:11.000]  Oh, so see, it's racially based.
[20:11.000 --> 20:18.000]  See, it's not a culture or an idea of freedom and Second Amendment and God or the right not to believe in God.
[20:18.000 --> 20:23.000]  It's a nation of Hispanics, but Mexico's Hispanic and has a border.
[20:23.000 --> 20:25.000]  Guatemala's Hispanic and has a border.
[20:25.000 --> 20:28.000]  And every other country is, quote, Hispanic.
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  Most folks down there say, no, we're just Latin, whatever.
[20:30.000 --> 20:31.000]  Does it matter?
[20:31.000 --> 20:41.000]  The point is, is that he's saying we're creating a racial component and saying there's no borders allowed in North America,
[20:41.000 --> 20:47.000]  but only at the border of Southern North America, Mexico.
[20:47.000 --> 20:56.000]  And so we're going to organize racially and then demand things, which is government handouts,
[20:56.000 --> 20:59.000]  but only enough to keep you subservient and under control.
[20:59.000 --> 21:08.000]  Look how good it is for the black folks at a lower level of illegitimacy in the 1940s that anybody else in this country now almost 90%.
[21:08.000 --> 21:13.000]  That was the great society and LBJs in the letter saying horrible racist things.
[21:13.000 --> 21:17.000]  I'm going to have those inwards vote in Democratic for 100 years.
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.000]  They're going back on the plantation and they don't even know it.
[21:20.000 --> 21:30.000]  And Jorge Ramos wants to sit there and say whites are a minority because we were America and opened up the borders and let everybody in.
[21:30.000 --> 21:34.000]  And then there's the vacant switch with the Democrats flipping it back saying, oh, it's racial now.
[21:34.000 --> 21:39.000]  It's all going to be race based, which will then make white people go into their race based system again.
[21:39.000 --> 21:47.000]  Like the ruling class of Mexico did 200 years ago before Mexico even existed.
[21:47.000 --> 21:51.000]  It was a vassal of Spain and then the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
[21:51.000 --> 21:52.000]  Yeah, I had no the history.
[21:52.000 --> 21:54.000]  How many Mexicans know their own history?
[21:54.000 --> 21:55.000]  How many Americans know?
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  See, I didn't actually know all this.
[21:57.000 --> 21:59.000]  It's so interesting.
[21:59.000 --> 22:07.000]  And so here's this guy saying to Latin America, oh, and what are the universities teach in Chicano and Hispanic studies,
[22:07.000 --> 22:14.000]  that communism is the answer and Che Guevara is the answer and that you could never rebel and have free market in your own property, your own ranch.
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.000]  You could never be part of the middle class of the upper class.
[22:17.000 --> 22:26.000]  No, you have to organize yourself in your barrios controlled by the locals that feed off you like Mr. Ramos.
[22:26.000 --> 22:31.000]  And you're right back in the feudalism yet again.
[22:31.000 --> 22:41.000]  Now Mr. Ramos looks like he has some, you know, native Indian features back when we thought this was India,
[22:41.000 --> 22:46.000]  circumnavigating the globe, running into the United States, running into Mexico, running into what's Mexico today.
[22:46.000 --> 22:53.000]  But actually you look at the ruling class of Mexico, I mean, they look like Spaniards looking paintings 500 years ago,
[22:53.000 --> 22:55.000]  because there's not one drop.
[22:55.000 --> 23:04.000]  In fact, I'm more under their yardstick. If you're Native American and then Spanish, you could say because I have some Native American that I'm more Hispanic
[23:04.000 --> 23:06.000]  than the ruling class of Mexico.
[23:06.000 --> 23:08.000]  I'm just a person.
[23:08.000 --> 23:13.000]  But the point is this is all complete absolute horsemaner.
[23:13.000 --> 23:17.000]  Total horsemaner.
[23:17.000 --> 23:21.000]  So for everybody that doesn't know being brainwashed, let me tell you what Hispanic is.
[23:21.000 --> 23:25.000]  The Moors invaded Spain and took over about 90% of it.
[23:25.000 --> 23:31.000]  And they were Arab and what's Arab? Asian, African and Anglo.
[23:31.000 --> 23:41.000]  So Spaniards, 95% of them have African, Asian and basically Germanic.
[23:41.000 --> 23:45.000]  Before Spain got overrun, it was basically Germanic, okay?
[23:45.000 --> 23:46.000]  Bonner blue.
[23:46.000 --> 23:55.000]  So that's what, that's what, so if you're Hispanic, you're basically Germanic, a little bit of African, and then some Asian,
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  because that's who came into Africa and all the Middle East, okay?
[23:57.000 --> 24:03.000]  Then you come here and then you intermarry with the Native Americans who are Chinese.
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  The genetics is the same thing.
[24:05.000 --> 24:14.000]  Tens of thousands of years ago over the Bering Lands land bridge into what is Canada today and then migrating down through the country,
[24:14.000 --> 24:21.000]  down through the continent, and the countries that are on the continent today of North America, Central America, South America.
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.000]  That's who you are, but no one will even tell you that.
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.000]  They'll just say, kill white people, they're the devil, colonialist.
[24:26.000 --> 24:35.000]  And it's colonialist with the ancestors like Mr. Ramos telling you this because they don't want you to ever figure out what we did in 1776
[24:35.000 --> 24:41.000]  and actually begin a program of actually having a system set up for the people where there is a giant middle class
[24:41.000 --> 24:45.000]  and where we get all the spaceships and medical care and all the stuff that a free society brings,
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.000]  that oh America's so evil, everybody wants to come here.
[24:49.000 --> 24:55.000]  Then the globalists want to try to extinguish all of that, so you have him spewing hardcore racism.
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.000]  An idea Tucker Carlson said, the United States is for white people.
[24:58.000 --> 24:59.000]  I would decry that.
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  What are you talking about?
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  A race, no, no, no, but, oh no, the majority's Hispanic.
[25:04.000 --> 25:05.000]  Yes, absolutely.
[25:05.000 --> 25:13.000]  In fact, it's already, most areas half Hispanic, by 2030 it's like 60, 70% total, absolutely.
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  And so what I said is it's your country.
[25:15.000 --> 25:20.000]  Don't you want free market and private property and guns and raising your own kids
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.000]  and not having the government forced abortions and deadly inoculations
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.000]  like they give the quote peasants in Mexico for Gardasil that sterilizing almost all those people.
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  Oh, I'm so anti-Mexican.
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  I don't want you to sterilize your daughter.
[25:31.000 --> 25:35.000]  Oh, but the loving liberals in your town have the shot.
[25:35.000 --> 25:41.000]  Guys like Ramos, your damn enemy, excuse me.
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  So it's sickening.
[25:43.000 --> 25:51.000]  It's absolutely, completely sickening to sit here and watch this level of garbage.
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  This is disgusting.
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.000]  So let's go ahead and start going over all this.
[25:58.000 --> 26:01.000]  Let's start with the race pimp.
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  I mean, this guy is a monster.
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  And this is what's taught in schools.
[26:05.000 --> 26:06.000]  This is what Kids are Forced said.
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.000]  It's why all over California in the Ninth Circuit rule, you can't wear American flags at school
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  because it'll upset the Hispanics.
[26:12.000 --> 26:17.000]  Who brainwashed Hispanic people that have moved here that they shouldn't be able to see an American flag?
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  People like Jorge Ramos.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  That's who.
[26:21.000 --> 26:26.000]  And by the way, he cold-bloodedly knows exactly what he's doing.
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.000]  I wonder if Ramos has kids.
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  I wonder who he tells him to marry.
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  Again, total class system in Mexico.
[26:34.000 --> 26:39.000]  People that have kept themselves separate from the quote natives for 10, 15 generations.
[26:39.000 --> 26:40.000]  Longer than that.
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  Hell, 500 years?
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  Boy, that's pretty damn racist.
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000]  Hey, Jorge, did you adopt a Korean person like my family did?
[26:49.000 --> 26:55.000]  No, because you're a stinking pig and a stinking race baiting Hispanic KKK race manager
[26:55.000 --> 27:00.000]  trying to hurt your own people and I indict you as a slug and an enemy of humanity.
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.000]  Now, let's go ahead and play this race pep. Here he is.
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.000]  Jorge Ramos is an anchor for Univision and one of the president's loudest critics on immigration.
[27:08.000 --> 27:09.000]  He joins us tonight.
[27:09.000 --> 27:10.000]  He's a parasite.
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.000]  Thanks for coming on.
[27:11.000 --> 27:12.000]  Great to be here.
[27:12.000 --> 27:13.000]  Thank you.
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.000]  So at an event several weeks ago in February, you said this and I wanted to ask you about it.
[27:16.000 --> 27:17.000]  And I'm quoting you.
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.000]  I'm a proud Latino immigrant here in the United States.
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.000]  You know exactly what is going on here in the U.S.
[27:23.000 --> 27:28.000]  There are many people who do not want us to be here and who want to create a wall in order to separate us.
[27:28.000 --> 27:29.000]  But you know what?
[27:29.000 --> 27:30.000]  This is also our country.
[27:30.000 --> 27:31.000]  Let me repeat this.
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  Our country, not theirs.
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  It's our country.
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  Who's the us and who's the they?
[27:37.000 --> 27:38.000]  Whose country is it?
[27:38.000 --> 27:39.000]  This is our country.
[27:39.000 --> 27:40.000]  It is yours.
[27:40.000 --> 27:41.000]  It is mine.
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.000]  And it is ours.
[27:42.000 --> 27:48.000]  The interesting thing is that with the Trump administration and many people who support Donald Trump,
[27:48.000 --> 27:53.000]  they think it is their country, that it is a white country and they are absolutely wrong.
[27:53.000 --> 27:54.000]  This is not a white country.
[27:54.000 --> 27:55.000]  This is not their country.
[27:55.000 --> 27:56.000]  It is ours.
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  And that's precisely what I'm saying.
[27:58.000 --> 28:06.000]  Look, in 2044 this country, the white population will become a minority.
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  It will be a minority majority country.
[28:08.000 --> 28:09.000]  That's precisely what I'm saying.
[28:09.000 --> 28:12.000]  Latinos, Asians, African-Americans, whites.
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  It is our country, Tucker.
[28:14.000 --> 28:15.000]  Right.
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.000]  You are white, obviously.
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  He teaches on his own channel about to raise crap.
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.000]  That's what you mean by white or Latino.
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.000]  But let me just ask you again to explain.
[28:24.000 --> 28:26.000]  Our country, not theirs.
[28:26.000 --> 28:27.000]  Who is they?
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  Whose country is it not?
[28:29.000 --> 28:36.000]  Well, many people who want to go back to 1965, when there was a white majority, many people
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  who believed that Latinos and immigrants...
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.000]  All right, pause.
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  The good part's coming up.
[28:40.000 --> 28:44.000]  Just to be clear, obviously there are white people that are tribal.
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.000]  And then they see a bunch of other groups forming into tribal groups, and it makes them legitimize
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  their tribalism, that is, quote, racism.
[28:49.000 --> 28:53.000]  The point is, the idea that only white people are tribal is pure bull.
[28:53.000 --> 28:59.000]  And the point is, is that the left has broken the social compact of bringing people in that are hard workers
[28:59.000 --> 29:02.000]  and then getting them into the melting pot of American culture.
[29:02.000 --> 29:08.000]  They're being indoctrinated to be anti-nation state, anti-sovereignty with the Pope leading Latin America
[29:08.000 --> 29:12.000]  and other areas saying populism and nationalism is evil.
[29:12.000 --> 29:19.000]  So, that's the problem, George, is that you and others, you know, full well, I've seen you over the years
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.000]  with all the race-baiting garbage and all the LaRica conquist the billboards for your, you know, univision,
[29:24.000 --> 29:29.000]  and Guadalupe Hidalgo Treaty and all this crap.
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.000]  It just goes on and on.
[29:31.000 --> 29:32.000]  This is what's taught.
[29:32.000 --> 29:35.000]  You teach people to have chips on their shoulders.
[29:35.000 --> 29:38.000]  I'll say from my research and statistics, it's not been very successful,
[29:38.000 --> 29:41.000]  because folks are too busy out making a living and having the American dream,
[29:41.000 --> 29:42.000]  but it's just disgusting.
[29:42.000 --> 30:11.000]  We're going to come back and get to the part right here on the other side. Stay with us.
[30:12.000 --> 30:34.000]  We're going to come back here on the other side.
[30:42.000 --> 31:04.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[31:04.000 --> 31:13.000]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children. The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[31:13.000 --> 31:22.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[31:22.000 --> 31:27.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children.
[31:27.000 --> 31:37.000]  Through the best job you can to purify your air, the elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[31:37.000 --> 31:39.000]  The general public doesn't.
[31:39.000 --> 31:43.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:43.000 --> 31:47.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:47.000 --> 31:54.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:54.000 --> 32:00.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[32:00.000 --> 32:09.000]  Today we call it bone broth, and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[32:09.000 --> 32:22.000]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfoWarsLive.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[32:22.000 --> 32:30.000]  Caveman, it's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors, and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[32:30.000 --> 32:38.000]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[32:38.000 --> 32:46.000]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[32:46.000 --> 32:54.000]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[32:54.000 --> 33:20.000]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself at InfoWarsLive.com today.
[33:24.000 --> 33:50.000]  And I'm feeling mean. That's right. Mr. Nice Guy.
[33:50.000 --> 33:58.000]  By the way, this ties into the whole censorship stack I'm going to get to. Look at this article at InfoWars.com. It's amazing.
[33:58.000 --> 34:08.000]  Prosoros Rock Band burns InfoWars newspaper in new video, and they have a Sikh group doing it.
[34:08.000 --> 34:15.000]  I guess confusing people that he's a Muslim and the biggest enemy of the Muslims is the Sikhs because millions of Indians have been killed by Muslims.
[34:15.000 --> 34:24.000]  And I'm not here bashing Muslims. Millions of Muslims have been killed by Muslims. The radical Islam is always trying to conquer everything.
[34:24.000 --> 34:33.000]  Wow. And I love the push again banning whiteboards and colleges and now saying they want to just basically ban books because somebody might write something bad.
[34:33.000 --> 34:42.000]  This is so authoritarian. It's beyond anything I've ever even heard of in a fantasy novel, in a dystopic nightmare vision.
[34:42.000 --> 34:47.000]  But they just push it and push it and push it because they're so entitled.
[34:47.000 --> 34:55.000]  And yeah, we're off Google ads. Twitter and Facebook are restricting us more and more and blocking us.
[34:55.000 --> 35:03.000]  I mean, it is just amazing to see this type of garbage being pushed by so-called pseudo-intellectuals who just never stop.
[35:03.000 --> 35:09.000]  And they desperately want to shut our speech down.
[35:09.000 --> 35:16.000]  They desperately want to do it. Let me get into the big news here at Paul Ryan and what's happening with the health care bill and the rest of it.
[35:16.000 --> 35:20.000]  The repeal of Obamacare. But let's get back to George Ramos.
[35:20.000 --> 35:24.000]  And you know, I get really mad at him because I've watched him over the years race bait.
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.000]  I've seen what he says on Univision. I've seen the lies he puts out.
[35:27.000 --> 35:35.000]  He knows Mexico has a wall and offense and tortures people that come in and gives them six months to a year hard labor.
[35:35.000 --> 35:42.000]  I don't think we should do that. Trump's going after criminals. Trump's going after people that have press conferences and shoot their mouths off and flaunt the law.
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.000]  Trump is going to open it up to make it easier to come into the country if you're legal and not a criminal.
[35:47.000 --> 35:52.000]  Notice that health care is a little liberal now. A bunch of free stuff and the Republicans are like, what are you doing, Trump?
[35:52.000 --> 36:01.000]  I told you folks, Trump's more like a mix between Democrats, Republicans and populism. He wants prosperity.
[36:01.000 --> 36:08.000]  I frankly agree with Rand Paul. We need his bill that he's introduced past. It's excellent. It's a repeal.
[36:08.000 --> 36:14.000]  That's what the public wants. It's what the polls show. We do not need Paul Ryan, who Rand Paul has said is trying to deceive the president,
[36:14.000 --> 36:20.000]  who now Paul Ryan is now going direct to the people. We'll show some of that up and tell him the president, but do it slicker than Paul Ryan.
[36:20.000 --> 36:27.000]  Start at least a few nights a week. Fire side chats, just like Roosevelt did during a time of crisis.
[36:27.000 --> 36:38.000]  And talk about positive things you're doing, have guests on, citizens on, making about little people, and also have graphics and charts and break down the truth.
[36:38.000 --> 36:46.000]  When they lie about you, you know, spend 10 minutes of the 30 minute deal showing where they lied, show where the media did good,
[36:46.000 --> 36:54.000]  show good Democrats, show good Republicans, you know, show citizens every show, every transmission, every presentation,
[36:54.000 --> 37:01.000]  every production that are doing good for the country and, you know, hiring people and taking action and have immigrant Americans on,
[37:01.000 --> 37:08.000]  like the great Filipino dressmaker, you know, that made that dress that sit shock waves across the country from the Emmys.
[37:08.000 --> 37:15.000]  And you, with your star talent, with your Q scores, with your believability, and with the truth you're going to be promoting,
[37:15.000 --> 37:24.000]  we'll have the highest rated presentation ever. I predict 20 million people watch it a night if you just keep doing it.
[37:24.000 --> 37:29.000]  And then around the world, hundreds of millions will end up watching it. They'll have to rebroadcast it everywhere.
[37:29.000 --> 37:36.000]  It will have a giant effect and completely bypass what's left of the dinosaur media, the fake stream media.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  Paul Ryan's doing it.
[37:38.000 --> 37:47.000]  I'll get to that in a moment and show some of what he's saying, pushing his disinfo about the new health plan. Is it about 30%, 40% better than Obama?
[37:47.000 --> 37:52.000]  And his plan, absolutely. But Obama got his plan from the Republicans who helped write it.
[37:52.000 --> 38:00.000]  So now we're basically getting what Governor Mitt Romney came up with 15 years ago in Massachusetts.
[38:00.000 --> 38:03.000]  That's what we're getting, again, what the Republicans wanted in the first place.
[38:03.000 --> 38:10.000]  Sure, Obama did some even worse stuff. He wanted to bankrupt healthcare completely. It has mandates, you know, for $5,000 a year and all this.
[38:10.000 --> 38:17.000]  This thing's got mandates in it, too, but it's the insurance companies that are going to enforce it. And it gives them a green light to gouge you.
[38:17.000 --> 38:23.000]  And it doesn't allow in all the competition. So Paul Ryan, as usual, is a monster. Let's just call him out.
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.000]  Another know-it-all thinks he's the elite garbage.
[38:27.000 --> 38:35.000]  Now, let's go ahead and go back to Mr. Ramos' stories up on DrudgeReport.com.
[38:35.000 --> 38:41.000]  Ramos, whites will become minority. This is our country. Those are his quotes.
[38:41.000 --> 38:45.000]  They keep saying, oh, but, you know, it's all our country.
[38:45.000 --> 38:56.000]  The point is, is that it's a racially based system, then the elites manage all the little subgroups off against each other. It's disgusting. Let's go back to it.
[38:56.000 --> 39:05.000]  When there was a wide majority, many people who believed that Latinos and immigrants and refugees shouldn't be here. That's exactly what I was referring to.
[39:05.000 --> 39:08.000]  So it's not their country?
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  It belongs to those people? What are you saying?
[39:10.000 --> 39:19.000]  It's also their country, but it's not only their country. We have to understand that this is a multi-control, multi-racial country, and we have to live and be tolerant.
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.000]  That's exactly what I was referring to. It is our country.
[39:22.000 --> 39:23.000]  I agree with that.
[39:23.000 --> 39:29.000]  Now, I would, you know, I don't want to bring this to race. You did, so I'm going to follow up on that. But let me ask you this theoretical question.
[39:29.000 --> 39:47.000]  You're backing up 20 seconds if you can, guys, where he says we have to be multi-cultural, live together like the night circuit ruling that you can't wear American flags in public schools because it's upsetting because the Hispanics have been so brainwashed in those schools, at least some of them, that it's a hurtful symbol.
[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  And then the illegals march all over the country and pull down American flags.
[39:50.000 --> 40:00.000]  Mexico would never put up with that because Mexico at least has nationalism, at least gets that, you know, there's some sovereignty and solidarity in the people in that.
[40:00.000 --> 40:09.000]  So you can pull up the articles, you can pull up the night circuit ruling, the same ones that say, you know, we can't control our borders, saying that you can't have American flags.
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.000]  This is brainwashing. This is intolerance.
[40:12.000 --> 40:20.000]  Political correctness is beating up Trump supporters all over the country and calling for the president's death. You're intolerant, you're bullies.
[40:20.000 --> 40:25.000]  And I'll say this, it's not the Hispanics of this nation are not the shocktrips of this.
[40:25.000 --> 40:41.000]  And quite frankly, the Hispanics in this country who have come here on average work very hard and come from really bad countries and bad backgrounds and have made the most of it and aren't as spoiled as a lot of Native Americans are by Native, I mean, people that have lived here, not classic Native Americans.
[40:41.000 --> 40:48.000]  And there's a problem too with second third generation immigrants, they turn into just as big a slob as anybody else.
[40:48.000 --> 40:58.000]  To the point is this is a decadence problem that we have. Do we need to bring in populations because whether you're Hispanic, white or black, we've aborted half our kids, absolutely.
[40:58.000 --> 41:16.000]  But the issue is the third world is being used as a weapon system against the first world to drive down wages. And that's why the Republican elite and the Democratic elite have wanted to have the biggest immigration histories ever seen of absolutely unwashed masses,
[41:16.000 --> 41:29.000]  not checked, not examined diseases, health problems, you name it, to bankrupt and weigh things down. They want to blow out Western economies and consolidate control. That's admitted in Cloward and Piven.
[41:29.000 --> 41:39.000]  It's admitted in the UN strategies and this plan of globalism to flood the first world and implode it so that they can dictate the terms of our surrender must be stopped.
[41:39.000 --> 41:51.000]  And George Ramos and others in the Pope Francis can jump up and down with their race-baiting crap. But they don't open up their mansions and their walled cities for the third world populations.
[41:51.000 --> 41:58.000]  They tell everybody else, we've got to sit there and pay for it. And it's wrong. Let's go back to the piece. Here it is.
[41:58.000 --> 42:10.000]  But it's not only their country. We have to understand that this is a multi-control, multi-racial country, and we have to live and be tolerant. That's exactly what I was referring to. It is our country.
[42:10.000 --> 42:21.000]  I agree with that. I don't want to bring this to race. You did, so I'm going to follow up on that. But let me ask you this theoretical question. What immigration restrictions would you favor in Mexico?
[42:21.000 --> 42:28.000]  It's already a felony to be there illegally, but what further restrictions in the country of Mexico, the country of your birth, would you favor?
[42:28.000 --> 42:41.000]  Mexico is a terrible example for the protection of immigrants. Mexico treats Central American immigrants in a terrible way. So I wouldn't put Mexico as an example. I think countries should be judged by the way they treat the most vulnerable.
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.000]  Good pause again.
[42:42.000 --> 42:53.000]  He doesn't say this on his show. I'm not saying it's good that Mexico tortures people. They shoot basically hot sauce up your nose with a shaken Coca-Cola or Sprite.
[42:53.000 --> 43:01.000]  And you know, try to find out where the people come in. You understand Mexico is rich compared to most third world countries. It's like it's on the high end.
[43:01.000 --> 43:11.000]  Guatemala is on the low end. I mean, Guatemala, I had family that lived there for over a decade. I mean, kidnapping everywhere. People shot at the market every day.
[43:11.000 --> 43:20.000]  You name it. I mean, I'm not saying Mexico is doing a good thing because I think it is a little too extreme, but the point is it's 10 times harsher than the U.S.
[43:20.000 --> 43:28.000]  So how does then Mexico tell us that we can't have a border or any controls when we're one of the most open nations in the world?
[43:28.000 --> 43:37.000]  So George, to his credit, has to admit that that's actually a good point, but that Mexico is a terrible example.
[43:37.000 --> 43:44.000]  Mexico can't open itself up to Central and South America. Are you crazy?
[43:44.000 --> 43:57.000]  Half those countries down there are in total turmoil with people starving on the streets everywhere. The collapse of civilization, most of the animals, the cats and dogs have been eaten, the zoos have been robbed for the meat.
[43:57.000 --> 44:08.000]  The elite are basically leaving all those countries, so there's a brain drain and it's totally collapsing. And then you want us to be like that, too, because the globalists want that.
[44:08.000 --> 44:20.000]  And you're on the big New World Order, multinational owned univision. Most of it controlled by U.S. executives that are as white as the piece of paper I'm holding here in my hand.
[44:20.000 --> 44:27.000]  It's a bunch of, it's all about white people. It's a bunch of fat cats that are totally cold-blooded and hate everybody and want to make everybody poor.
[44:27.000 --> 44:36.000]  They don't care what color you are. You ever heard like the Clippers owner and all these other old rich owners? I don't care if they're, quote, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant or Jewish.
[44:36.000 --> 44:46.000]  They all sound like KKK members. I want to repeat what they say because the media will take it out of context. You've all heard what they say.
[44:46.000 --> 45:04.000]  You've all heard it, man. That's what the old rich billionaires are like. Just 30 years ago, Donald Trump was buying up golf courses and clubs everywhere where black people, Hispanics and Jews weren't allowed and they would try to stop him buying the golf courses and private clubs.
[45:04.000 --> 45:16.000]  Because they knew, you can read the news articles from the time, that all that such-and-such lover, we're going to stop him and guess what? Donald Trump kicked their butts all over this country.
[45:16.000 --> 45:24.000]  Oh, but he's the racist. Again, ladies and gentlemen, this is the garbage they spew at everybody. It's a lie.
[45:24.000 --> 45:35.000]  The rich elites that own the country clubs that don't want anybody in there but themselves are the type people that pull George Ramos' strings. Let's finish up.
[45:35.000 --> 45:48.000]  We're in a horrible job when it comes to human rights and it comes to treating Central America. On the other hand, here in the United States I think we have the responsibility to treat immigrants in a decent, in a humane way.
[45:48.000 --> 46:00.000]  We are responsible partly because of that. They come here on documented immigrants because there are thousands of American companies who hire them and millions of Americans including you and me and the audience who benefit from their work.
[46:00.000 --> 46:06.000]  So I think we have the right and the responsibility to treat them much better than the way they treat them in Mexico.
[46:06.000 --> 46:21.000]  We do treat immigrants much better than Mexico does. Mexico, six months to a year hard labor, they contact your family if you've got credit cards and extort money out of them.
[46:21.000 --> 46:35.000]  It's well known. This is the government of Mexico and they'll torture you. Sometimes they kill you. The Mexican police, in fact it's in the London Guardian article, routinely in half the cases they rape the women.
[46:35.000 --> 46:47.000]  Oh, I'll teach you to come here illegally with your kids. They shove your kids in another room and then take you in and rape you as a form of punishment.
[46:47.000 --> 47:00.000]  Can you imagine if the border patrol got caught raping anybody? It'd be cities burning down because America has such high standards and absolutely I don't want that to happen but I personally have been shaken down by Mexican police.
[47:00.000 --> 47:06.000]  It's not as bad as it used to be because they've gotten some corruption under control at least in that area.
[47:06.000 --> 47:14.000]  But I'm just so sick of everyone lecturing America about how bad we are all day when we're the most open country in the world.
[47:14.000 --> 47:26.000]  And now the globalists want to destroy what makes it so successful, your capability to become wealthy and successful, independent.
[47:26.000 --> 47:33.000]  Whatever those goals are, whether it's to have your own little restaurant or your own little car dealership or your own little bookstore or your own little farm or your own little auto parts store
[47:33.000 --> 47:39.000]  or whether you want to open a chain of auto parts stores or whether you want it, whatever it is and you think you just do that in Mexico?
[47:39.000 --> 47:43.000]  If you're not part of the elite group, you get your ass killed.
[47:43.000 --> 47:50.000]  But see, Americans would fight back if you tried to come in their business and say you couldn't have business.
[47:50.000 --> 47:57.000]  Go read the stuff that was written by George Washington. He wasn't allowed to have his own businesses that weren't controlled by a British lord
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.000]  and because he wasn't royal, he couldn't open his own companies and businesses.
[48:00.000 --> 48:05.000]  And that's the main reason we had the war. There were a lot of reasons.
[48:05.000 --> 48:12.000]  There was a draft where they would press gang, your kids and grab them at age like six, seven, eight, put them on a ship, probably never see them again.
[48:12.000 --> 48:20.000]  No, slavery. They just didn't call it that. So there's a lot of reasons for revolutionary war, but the ideas we had, the reasons that we did it,
[48:20.000 --> 48:25.000]  is the reason everybody wanted to come here because even though we only achieved a few percentage points of what we wanted to do,
[48:25.000 --> 48:29.000]  it was so much better than anywhere else, it produced more wealth than the world's ever seen.
[48:29.000 --> 48:39.000]  The United States by 1955 had over 50% of the planet's wealth and almost all of it was with the small business owner and the small independent person.
[48:39.000 --> 48:48.000]  You fast forward 65, 60 years later, the United States has a fraction of the wealth it had and almost all of it is in 1%.
[48:48.000 --> 48:57.000]  And the 1%ers, they're almost to a man and a woman want open borders and to bring in giant third world masses because they care about you and your family.
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.000]  No, they want to break you and they're going to do it.
[49:00.000 --> 49:09.000]  And if you're stupid enough to believe Jorge and George Soros and Carlos Slim and Paul Ryan and all these other evil people like George W. Bush,
[49:09.000 --> 49:17.000]  then you deserve what happens to you because it's true. This is your country if you're Hispanic. You deserve it, you didn't kill your kids.
[49:17.000 --> 49:20.000]  And now you're going to let them steal your whole birthright.
[49:20.000 --> 49:24.000]  What, 100 years you'll all be communists or something or live under eugenics?
[49:24.000 --> 49:30.000]  If the global's even let that happen, you're like, thank God we got rid of our birthright of free market and wealth. Yeah.
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.000]  Everybody's basically got brown skin, isn't that great?
[49:34.000 --> 49:44.000]  We got rid of the evil property. Doesn't matter what color you are, accept the system, accept what creates wealth and power and success.
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.000]  North Korea's a hellhole. They can't even make automobiles.
[49:47.000 --> 49:55.000]  They have crazy elites running around dominating everybody, inbreeding. But some insane people.
[49:55.000 --> 50:02.000]  Just like insane people in Europe interbred. Just like a lot of the Muslims of interbred are completely insane.
[50:02.000 --> 50:05.000]  We need the new blood. That's what it's all about.
[50:05.000 --> 50:09.000]  But we don't need people getting brainwashed the minute they get her. I'm skipping this break too.
[50:09.000 --> 50:13.000]  Let's go back and finish up with the Tucker Carlson piece. It's taken too long, but here it is.
[50:13.000 --> 50:19.000]  Quickly, will you just acknowledge the truth? And you're obviously a very rich person and I'm rich people a lot.
[50:19.000 --> 50:26.000]  Rich people in America disproportionately benefit from low wage, low skilled immigration in the form of household help in the form of cheap labor.
[50:26.000 --> 50:29.000]  Let's be totally honest. The middle of the country doesn't benefit a lot from this.
[50:29.000 --> 50:35.000]  It lowers wages. They don't hire a lot of household help. And there is a lot of crime, whether you're willing to admit it or not.
[50:35.000 --> 50:39.000]  There's not a lot of crime. There's not a lot of crime.
[50:39.000 --> 50:45.000]  On average, the immigrant populations until about a decade ago were not high crime.
[50:45.000 --> 50:53.000]  But now the criminals are all coming up here to exploit the networks that have been built and Mexico has a failed state because of the crime networks.
[50:53.000 --> 51:01.000]  So don't give us that, Mr. Ramos. You know damn well there's a giant crime wave coming out of Latin America. Let's go back to it.
[51:01.000 --> 51:05.000]  Let's just pretend that I didn't say that because it's a fake news.
[51:05.000 --> 51:09.000]  The king of fake news when it comes to...
[51:09.000 --> 51:13.000]  Donald Trump's the king of fake news. There's no crime coming up here, bro.
[51:13.000 --> 51:17.000]  Really?
[51:17.000 --> 51:21.000]  Okay, let's go back to it.
[51:21.000 --> 51:31.000]  It doesn't actually help an American citizen born here making 40 grand a year to have a bunch of people willing to work for 25 grand a year moving to his town. Will you concede that?
[51:31.000 --> 51:35.000]  No.
[51:35.000 --> 51:39.000]  There's a minimum impact on... No, you can laugh if you want, but that's not the truth.
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  I am.
[51:41.000 --> 51:47.000]  Because you're laughing that doesn't mean it is the truth. Check the National Academy of Sciences. There's an immigration surplus.
[51:47.000 --> 51:51.000]  Overall, immigrants contribute much more to the economy than what they take away in the question in social services.
[51:51.000 --> 51:59.000]  Those are the facts. Some people might be affected, but overall, which is what we care about, overall, they have a positive impact.
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  Okay, well, hey, Ramos. Thanks a lot for joining us. Appreciate it.
[52:01.000 --> 52:07.000]  Well, I'll say this. People out of Latin America are 100 times better people out of the Middle East statistically.
[52:07.000 --> 52:26.000]  Oh, let's talk about that. It's not going to be the Latin Americans anymore, folks. That's not even the big group anymore. It's Chinese coming here who are middle class and wealthy to exploit that we're idiots and having their babies for free, who then become citizens and get up to $50,000 in welfare a year.
[52:26.000 --> 52:34.000]  Can I go to China and do that? No. If I went to China and overstayed my visa, they'd locked me up so fast it'd make my head spin. But that's okay.
[52:34.000 --> 52:43.000]  Because China kills, you know, Buddhist and sells their organs. And, you know, because they're Asian, it's okay. Because the only evil in the world is when white people do it, right?
[52:43.000 --> 52:57.000]  Let me tell you what's coming up. I want to get into the healthcare battle. I want to get into, which is obviously big news. I want to get into military news, economic news. I want to get into attacks on free speech news, internet kill switch news.
[52:57.000 --> 53:06.000]  I want to get into just the fact that Facebook admits that the artificial intelligence that they're developed is able to tell the future.
[53:06.000 --> 53:18.000]  Well, yeah, and that's why they knew Hillary was going to lose. So they freaked out and tried to say it was impossible for Trump to win. Then they tried to steal the election, but the defeat was so huge that you failed.
[53:18.000 --> 53:27.000]  And now you're in total panic mode because this stuff only works when the public believes the AI brainwashing. You know, how's that AI brainwash?
[53:27.000 --> 53:37.000]  It programs the TV, it programs the buzzwords, it programs the feeds, how they censor people, but because they've got to censor more and more to get the AI outcome they want,
[53:37.000 --> 53:43.000]  they're going to have to totally shut down free speech for this to win and you don't have the presidency. So you're going to have big trouble doing that.
[53:43.000 --> 53:55.000]  So you're trying to creep around doing it real slow right now, hoping you can put the fires out, but it's too little, too late. Nationalism and self-determination and rugged individualism is exploding too fast.
[53:55.000 --> 54:09.000]  But remember, you heard here first, the cameras and microphones are watching and listening to you. You heard here first that major giant internet collection systems like Google and Facebook are meant to manipulate mass movements of people, not just track them.
[54:09.000 --> 54:19.000]  And remember, remember, you heard there's giant pedophile rings nationwide that are basically taken over the country that Trump would begin mass arrest of them, which has begun and now even town halls reporting on it.
[54:19.000 --> 54:28.000]  Remember, remember, remember that I know what I'm talking about and don't say you weren't straight shot right out of Texas.
[54:28.000 --> 54:36.000]  Don't say that quite frankly God didn't put people there to give you the message so you had a decision on what you wanted to do via free will.
[54:36.000 --> 54:43.000]  You think God's just going to put a bunch of AI and let the devil do all this and not give you a chance to know what's happening.
[54:43.000 --> 54:53.000]  Not just this broadcast, but all over the place. You're getting the truth. You're getting a straight shot at what's happening. You can sit there and deny it after you see what I tell you.
[54:53.000 --> 55:08.000]  Turn out to be absolutely on target from their own documents hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times.
[55:08.000 --> 55:16.000]  The globalists have to get you to want to turn off your life force and roll over and die to give up your spirit to give up control to give up your free will.
[55:16.000 --> 55:27.000]  That's why they put Satanism everywhere and murder and death and destruction to make you feel ugly inside so that you decide to basically not care about yourself or others and give up so they can rule over you.
[55:27.000 --> 55:30.000]  They want you out of their way. They hate you.
[55:30.000 --> 55:41.000]  They're selfish, empty nobodies in Hollywood. They're selfish, empty nobodies in the so-called music industry and they only are followed and listened to by the weakest, stupidest, dumb-down people.
[55:41.000 --> 55:46.000]  Those of us that are awake, more and more in them, exodus away from them.
[55:46.000 --> 55:55.000]  That's why they're trying to censor this mass awakening and keep you from understanding you're number one. You're part of the majority. You're part of the great awakening.
[55:55.000 --> 55:59.000]  You love God. You love justice. You resonate with truth.
[55:59.000 --> 56:03.000]  They want to make you feel like you're alone. You're never alone.
[56:03.000 --> 56:18.000]  The enemy wants to create false realities like what you see in downtown New York City with all the TVs and Jumbotrons and face scanning systems.
[56:18.000 --> 56:27.000]  They want to insert you into a false reality because that's the only way they can control you, like B.F. Skinner raising little kids in boxes so he could be their God.
[56:27.000 --> 56:35.000]  They want to be God, but to do that, they've got to shrink the universe down to nothing to pretend they're God. They're the ultimate posers.
[56:35.000 --> 56:42.000]  We've got so much coming up in the next hour. We've got a bunch of guests as well that I'll be telling you about before I go any further.
[56:42.000 --> 56:45.000]  I want to thank all the listeners for getting the new t-shirts.
[56:45.000 --> 56:51.000]  Trump penns 2020, Keeping America Great. Just to get out there and promote free speech, meet like-minded people. It's amazing.
[56:51.000 --> 56:56.000]  If you haven't ordered them, get them. They're $9.95 free shipping this week through next week.
[56:56.000 --> 57:06.000]  So now's the time to take advantage. And we're also introducing, and I thought we'd have a month's supply of this, but people really understand how fungus and mold is in your guts and in your body.
[57:06.000 --> 57:13.000]  So Dr. Grubb, after a decade of research has come out with mycozx, we have the reviews up on infowarstore.com.
[57:13.000 --> 57:19.000]  From the studies he's done and now third-party reviews are coming in, it is simply incredible.
[57:19.000 --> 57:31.000]  And if you take it with the Biome Defense probiotic we have, they work synergistically while it knocks out the yeast and fungus in your gut, then it gets replaced with the best strains of active high-quality bacteria out there.
[57:31.000 --> 57:46.000]  It's incredible. Support the broadcast. It's a win-win-win. Get the mycozx today at infowarstore.com and get it with the 50 billion active strain or 25 billion active strain.
[57:46.000 --> 57:50.000]  We have the extra strength in regular biome defense and an additional 10% off.
[57:50.000 --> 57:56.000]  Time for autoship and additional 10% on that. And orders $50 or more free shipping.
[57:56.000 --> 58:03.000]  But this week it's all orders, whether they're $9.95 colloidal silver or whether it's biome defense and mycozx.
[58:03.000 --> 58:10.000]  Unfortunately, wow, I miscalculated again. I shouldn't have the money to order a massive amount of stuff and then if it doesn't sell, I'm sitting on it and we can't operate.
[58:10.000 --> 58:17.000]  But we miscalculated on mycozx. This is trying to be the best all-time seller in history if it keeps on like this.
[58:17.000 --> 58:22.000]  We'll be sold out at current sales rates by Saturday. So I'm going to take advantage of this out of the gates.
[58:22.000 --> 58:28.000]  I'm going to keep it discounted out of the gates because I want you to try it and see what it does and then share this with others.
[58:28.000 --> 58:36.000]  Because again, the pesticides and herbicides bio-accumulating the food we eat, it kills the good flora and only the bad flora ends up growing in there.
[58:36.000 --> 58:44.000]  It's available at InfoWarsLife.com or 088-253-3139. We'll be back. I'm going to be more focused. We had a good hour, but more focused in the next hour.
[58:44.000 --> 59:07.000]  It's a laser beam. All it is.
[59:14.000 --> 59:26.000]  We've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, SuperMail Vitality and so many others with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[59:26.000 --> 59:32.000]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products and this part is most important.
[59:32.000 --> 59:39.000]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[59:39.000 --> 59:45.000]  That means it's clean. That means it's pure and rest secured. You're finding the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[59:45.000 --> 59:52.000]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and vitamin mineral fusion. Take action now before we sell out.
[59:52.000 --> 1:00:03.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  It's hour number two. I'll tell you about the guests when we come back from this quick break in a few minutes, but I've got a very powerful John Bowne special report I want to get to.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  U.S. citizens under threat of foreign hackers thanks to the deep state.
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  Julian Assange came out and gave a little press conference today and he made the point that the CIA is claiming we're all enemies for having this.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  They're the ones that leaked it. They're the ones that don't have good practices, keeping secret stuff that's illegal they're doing.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  I love how they turn this around. Here is the John Bowne report and we'll be back.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  This is 8,761 documents known to the CIA as Year Zero.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  The gravity of the situation is monumental.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  As WikiLeaks writes, recently the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner,
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive. Year Zero introduces the scope and direction of the CIA's global covert hacking program.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  It's malware arsenal and dozens of zero-day weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products,
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  including Apple's iPhone, Google's Android, and Microsoft's Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  By the end of 2016, the CIA's hacking division, which formally falls under the agency's Center for Cyber Intelligence,
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  had over 5,000 registered users and had produced more than 1,000 hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other weaponized malware.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  Such is the scale of the CIA's undertaking that by 2016 its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  The CIA had created, in effect, its own NSA with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  Essentially, a cyber weapon of the heaviest caliber in the hands of any hacker on planet Earth.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  Not only has the CIA and its deep state web of political minions kept this total breach of human privacy quiet,
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  they have turned the illegal and compromised Frankenstein monster loose on America's executive branch.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  Meanwhile, the corporate critic, political elite, knowingly carried on with the charade that the CIA had proved the Russians were colluding with President Donald Trump,
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  knowing full well that the deep state could counterfeit any trace of hacking and in turn blaming it on rogue actors
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  to support a seditious coup of the President of the United States.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  Because of the seriousness of the accusations involved on all sides of this issue,
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  I want to make sure that we hold as many of these hearings out in public so that the American people and all of you can attend and report on.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  This is an initial list, but we have Director Comey of the FBI, Director Rogers of the NSA,
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  Former Director Brennan of the CIA, Former Director Clapper, Ms. Yates, Former Acting Attorney General.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  What they're interested in is warning the American public and the world that the so-called smart appliances, let's say a phone,
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  a smart TV, Samsung, Sony, even your smart car is totally vulnerable to the NSA and in particular the CIA.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  Now the NSA always had the mandate for cyber command and cyber warfare.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  The individual and the institution that never had the command or the mandate was the CIA.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  It has to release its mandate or it will be prosecuted for crimes against the state and it has already committed crimes against the state.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  Maybe now, as the intelligence community and the Schumer's Feinsteins and Pelosi's and the corrupt DC bubble are rightfully questioned due to this massive attack on the Bill of Rights,
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  they will come to feel the persuasive presence of Providence protecting these United States of America.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  President Trump, the swamp appears to be draining itself.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  Godspeed, Commander, and God bless America.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  John Bowne for Enforce.com
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  Katie Perry is now in a real estate dispute with nuns over an iconic multi-million dollar convent, Los Feliz, in Los Angeles.
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  The stunning property was built in 1927 and Perry has offered over $14 million for the property.
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  Problem is, Sister Rita Callahan and Sister Catherine Holtzman claim the property is theirs to sell,
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  having been the occupants there and part of the order of the immaculate heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and they won't sell it to Perry because they don't like her lifestyle,
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  a kind way of saying, she's a satanic witch.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  But the greedy Archdiocese of L.A. claims it is theirs to sell and they want to sell it to Perry for the exorbitant price.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  Perry tried to play coy with the sisters, saying she has a Jesus tattoo, but they called her out on her other tattoos,
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  her performances, and her attendance at a Salem witch walk, which conveniently she couldn't recall.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  They also brought up this statement from Perry.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  I want it to be like the Amy Grant of music, but it didn't work out and so I sold my soul to the devil.
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  This case has now reached the highest legal authorities in the Catholic Church.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:15.000]  Guess we will see where their loyalties lie. For Infowars.com, this is Owen Shroyer.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.

[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  There's information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of Survival Shield, nascent iodine, that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula, and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  It is exclusive to InfoWarsLife.com and the InfoWarsLife family of incredible products.

[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  We're already in the second hour broadcasting worldwide.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  On this Thursday, the ninth day of March 2017, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  Dave Rubin, who is just really a smart guy.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  I say that because I would never watch him when he was on the Young Turks because I couldn't listen to them and the arrogance and the ignorance and the lies.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  Then I got familiar with him going on the Joe Rogan podcast and some of the other work he's doing, and then I've been on some co-interviews with him on some other shows.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  The point is that he's going to be on with us in the third hour today. John Rappaport's hosting the fourth hour.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  I've got a lot to cover today. I may just co-host with Rappaport. That's kind of how that works sometimes in the fourth hour, if I want to take it over, I do.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  But Rappaport's always great to listen to. Rappaport's one of my favorite people to listen to, quite frankly.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  That's one of the few people I'll actually listen to at midnight if I'm still up while I'm doing work.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  I put Rappaport on when he fills in. I don't know why I'm volunteering that.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  I am so angry right now that I'm calm. That's what's happening.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  You're not getting the quacking Alex. You're getting the very, very angry Alex right now, so I'm trying to control myself.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  You know why I'm pissed off? Because it's so ridiculously obvious that Pope Francis is a horrible, demonic, anti-Christian slug.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  And that George Ramos, one of the biggest TV hosts in the world, is an absolute elitist trying to ensure that Latin Americans never get a middle class.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  I mean, they're so uncool. And we have the WikiLeaks. We know the social engineering.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  I've studied all these people. I know I'm right. I know Donald Trump actually wants a giant middle class,
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  and wants to advance people off of what they stand for, not what color they are.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  Just like Martin Luther King said, I know the ideology I'm promoting is an entire universe different and better than the globalist.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  I know the globalist. Our hell bent on social engineering and phasing out humanity.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  I've read four books by Bertrand Russell. I've read five books by Zbigniew Brzezinski. I've read both books Adolf Hitler wrote. What a scumbag.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  I have read it all. Okay, I basically read it all. I've seen, I've read the social engineering books of Eber Bernays.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  I've read the social engineering books of A.C. Wells.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  I don't say that like I'm bragging, but I realize that when I talk to pseudo-intellectuals, they might have read one of these.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  They did their thesis on in college, and they walk around acting like they're all intellectual and enlisting and acting wimpy like that's intellectual.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  They don't know anything. They know how to screw people over.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  They know how to put out dumbed-down ideology that dumbed-down populations go along with, but it's like giving some man who's dying of thirst in the desert an empty glass and saying, here, here, drink that.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  I just have hospitality. I'm not even saying I'm a perfect person, but I like life.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  I like hospitality. I like seeing people do good, and they see me as a chump, you see, because I'm not a sociopath. I'm not a psychopath.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  I am a primitive, snarling caveman, but thank God I'm not one of these modern scumbags ready to screw everybody over.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  I get fundamentally angry when I read WikiLeaks, thousands of pages of it, how they want to make you poor, how they want to hurt you.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  I mean, I just did like you, me and Buckley one night were up here late reading like hundreds of pages, and he said, he said, my God, he said, how could anyone be this nasty?
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  He's like, look, they're all nasty. Oh, we screwed these people over. Oh, we're going to rip these people off.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  It's like, ah, I want to get these people. I'll tell you a point blank, man. I want to get in the ring with them and go, here's a battle axe.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  I've got one. You want to screw people over? Try it with me, and it's not that I'm claiming I'm the toughest guy around, but I've got a will and an instinct to absolutely stomp their heads in.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  I am sick of scum. I am sick of backstabbing filth. I am tired of these people. I want to see the spirit of humanity rise up and defeat them.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  They make a big joke out of the fact that I get pissed off. The persecution of our species, if you don't have empathy and you don't metaphysically feel it, it's not just empathy.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  It's not just you see something happening, you're upset. You can feel it.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  And you look at these scumbags like Hayden up there, so weak, so pathetic, so dumb, so turned over to evil in his stupid little admiral outfit,
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  when he couldn't command his way out of a wet paper bag telling us, oh, the millennials are the fault of why all this jada keeps leaking.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  You're the ones, the buck stops with you. You're the one that let that get out. You're at fault, and you never take responsibility not for the crimes you commit against us.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  Or when you get caught, you claim it's the people that your own program helped dumb down. That's something else.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  You blame people, you dumb down, so you can control them on the fact that stuff leaked? I love that.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  Oh, you can't do good personnel because of a declassified CIA program that's been going on for 65 years to turn people into idiots.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  So weaklings like you can manage them, and then the snake eats itself, and it turns around and it blames the dumb down lazy society that you've helped foster and create.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  You blame it on your victims. That's something else, isn't it?
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  I look at North Korea and the stunted demonic little pig people that are ruling over those starving villagers and just having their way with them.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  But they're so brainwashed, they're almost free. They're just being tortured by a bunch of nobodies, and I just see where we're going.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  God Almighty, it makes me want to throw up what goes on in Venezuela, what goes on in Cuba, and then I get to hear all these slat-jawed, lazy college kids driving luxury cars with $1,000, $800 smartphones in their hands,
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  bitching and telling me how great communism is, and how I'm a white male so I have no opinion or no standing, but they're white males telling me that while they drive a car nicer than mine.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  I'll be in an anti-abortion protest, the communists get out, they're driving an $80,000 Jaguar Mercedes, and they're like, F you, you capitalist scum, and they're like wearing $800 shoes.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  And none of it's lost on them, you understand? It's like this rock band that's supposedly big, I'm told, pro soros rock band burns M4's newspaper in music video,
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  and they call for basically shutting us down, and then, oh, but get this, they sell their music, and they're rich.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  They say I'm anti-Muslim, and so they have a Sikh, who as a group, India would even exist if it probably wasn't for them, who battled the Muslims for 800 years.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  A Sikh. I love that propaganda as if you're going to show a Sikh that M4's is bad.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:30.880]  When I can't walk down a street and I'll have the Sikhs run over and start shaking my hand like Jesus Christ just landed
[1:16:30.880 --> 1:16:32.920]  And I'm not saying that's even a good thing
[1:16:32.920 --> 1:16:38.040]  But you don't know how I get mobbed by Indians wherever I go because they know Donald Trump's right
[1:16:38.360 --> 1:16:42.940]  There's a hundred plus million Indians have been killed by Islamist. Oh, yeah, 140 million
[1:16:43.920 --> 1:16:48.780]  So I love your little commie propaganda think it's gonna work on the Indians don't think so
[1:16:48.780 --> 1:16:53.380]  They've already been murdered for hundreds of years. They know you scum
[1:16:56.300 --> 1:17:01.260]  I'm see that's the ignorance of you people. Oh, we're communists. Oh, we make tens of millions a year
[1:17:01.260 --> 1:17:06.480]  Oh, oh by our album. Oh Alex is the capitalist burn his free speech
[1:17:12.220 --> 1:17:14.220]  See I haven't even gotten the measure
[1:17:14.220 --> 1:17:19.820]  It's just at a certain point. I'm just sick of hypocrites
[1:17:19.820 --> 1:17:28.220]  I just I am completely and totally tired of Bono got caught giving less than 1% of billions he raised for Africa and
[1:17:29.860 --> 1:17:33.340]  So he went up to 1.8% same thing with Hillary. I
[1:17:34.500 --> 1:17:39.860]  Mean, but it's okay cuz cuz she's liberal and she's a woman so steal all the money. It's okay, right?
[1:17:39.860 --> 1:17:46.340]  They're bad people and then you let's get to Paul Ryan first
[1:17:47.020 --> 1:17:49.020]  We have video Paul Ryan did a multi-hour
[1:17:49.660 --> 1:17:54.300]  Presentation so today where he went out with a TV and some graphics and lied to the American people
[1:17:54.300 --> 1:17:56.660]  I watched it part of it. I've got a print out of what he said
[1:17:57.380 --> 1:17:59.740]  This is the best deal. This is a lot better. No, Bob. I care
[1:17:59.820 --> 1:18:02.820]  No, Rand Paul has pointed out that this is a horrible deal
[1:18:02.820 --> 1:18:06.540]  You're trying to deceive the president into getting behind it and I'm glad to say Paul Ryan
[1:18:06.540 --> 1:18:12.220]  We have the votes to repeal the whole stinky thing then we can do something else if we want
[1:18:12.220 --> 1:18:17.940]  We're not gonna have the original Republican screw job version. Are there some good parts? Is it better than Obamacare?
[1:18:17.940 --> 1:18:23.420]  Yes, but it's not what Congress got sent there to do and it's worse than what a repeal is
[1:18:23.420 --> 1:18:28.860]  So you're not gonna get it any monster. You're not gonna get it. You sociopath con man
[1:18:28.860 --> 1:18:34.140]  You're not better than us. We see through you. You piece of felt and you will fall. I
[1:18:37.140 --> 1:18:40.340]  I'm so sick of these calm men. I'm so tired of them. I
[1:18:46.340 --> 1:18:48.340]  Pray for the day he gets thrown out of Congress
[1:18:48.620 --> 1:18:52.780]  He's a bigger enemy Hillary Clinton. He is the enemy of the American people
[1:18:52.780 --> 1:18:56.660]  He is funded massively by George Soros and he thinks he can con you
[1:18:56.660 --> 1:19:03.820]  He is a total piece of trash for the big insurance companies that want to make you buy their overpriced insurance
[1:19:03.820 --> 1:19:07.900]  We've already seen it massively increase in prices. We've seen the huge screw job
[1:19:07.900 --> 1:19:12.320]  It was designed to wreck the normal market and take out all the small companies and small
[1:19:15.260 --> 1:19:17.100]  Canes of hospitals and clinics
[1:19:17.100 --> 1:19:23.900]  This is a consolidation of the health care market and a screw job to the consumer and the American people in a private
[1:19:23.900 --> 1:19:28.300]  Corporate tax to offshore banks that own insurance companies and
[1:19:28.820 --> 1:19:33.540]  Paul Ryan is bought and paid for and he wants to rob you and your family
[1:19:33.540 --> 1:19:39.380]  Think about how he wants to rob tens of thousands of you from your money every year, but also get the big lesson
[1:19:40.220 --> 1:19:44.500]  Donald Trump needs to start doing his own presentations just like this at least a couple times a week
[1:19:44.540 --> 1:19:47.540]  Then I want to do it every night with his energy eight o'clock central
[1:19:47.540 --> 1:19:55.420]  I'm telling you it'll be the highest rated information in history and it will help further bring the globalist mainstream media down
[1:19:55.900 --> 1:19:59.440]  It's already down, but it's time to push the facade over. I'm Alex Jones
[1:20:00.020 --> 1:20:07.100]  Think about this your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead
[1:20:07.500 --> 1:20:13.820]  Disinfection chemicals like ammonia chlorine and chloramines and pharmaceuticals like statins pain meds and antidepressants
[1:20:13.820 --> 1:20:20.660]  And no water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out protect your family's water supply with a trusted

[1:20:59.700 --> 1:21:04.500]  Hi, this is Ron Paul. I am a former congressman physician and presidential candidate
[1:21:04.500 --> 1:21:07.220]  The world is in turmoil things like Ebola
[1:21:07.220 --> 1:21:11.620]  Earthquakes wars and famines are commonplace as Americans
[1:21:11.620 --> 1:21:15.340]  We are largely sheltered from these events however in parts of the world
[1:21:15.340 --> 1:21:18.700]  Just having enough food is a huge problem for some of us
[1:21:18.700 --> 1:21:22.220]  There is the nagging thought that we may not always have it so good
[1:21:22.220 --> 1:21:28.620]  So we keep some food on hand just in case my family and I have found a product that helps us do this better
[1:21:28.620 --> 1:21:34.540]  It's a home freeze dryer from harvest right with it. We eat healthier and store a little more food

[1:21:59.140 --> 1:22:05.820]  Hi there, Dick Holgeier here. I was a mainstream television news reporter for over three decades
[1:22:05.820 --> 1:22:09.740]  I normally never do commercial endorsements
[1:22:09.740 --> 1:22:12.380]  I am very skeptical of health supplements
[1:22:12.380 --> 1:22:16.380]  But a friend of mine told me about his experience with synergy one
[1:22:16.380 --> 1:22:21.100]  So I purchased a bottle and my wife and I have been using it for a few weeks now
[1:22:21.100 --> 1:22:27.260]  I very much dislike so-called energy boosters those little energy drinks that have caffeine and
[1:22:27.260 --> 1:22:34.380]  Gerana and other things that make your heart race. This is not that my experience with synergy one has been great
[1:22:34.380 --> 1:22:39.020]  My mood is better. My joints feel better. I have more vigor more stamina
[1:22:39.500 --> 1:22:47.260]  Way increased productivity. My wife and I both noticed that we even dream more so I recommend synergy one
[1:22:47.260 --> 1:22:55.660]  It's really good stuff. I'm having great results with it call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com
[1:22:55.660 --> 1:22:57.660]  That's one world
[1:22:57.660 --> 1:22:58.780]  whey.com
[1:22:58.780 --> 1:23:05.780]  This is the story of the shaving company called Harry's in an epic battle of David versus Goliath in the early 1980s
[1:23:05.780 --> 1:23:13.060]  A child was born two of them actually their names were Jeff and Andy time went by they developed facial hair and one day
[1:23:13.300 --> 1:23:16.660]  Something happened Andy got ripped off buying overpriced razors
[1:23:16.780 --> 1:23:22.300]  So they decided to start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all they hired the best designers
[1:23:22.300 --> 1:23:29.580]  They bought a 95 year old German blade factory and they started selling high-quality razors online with no up charging direct to customers
[1:23:29.660 --> 1:23:33.940]  How did the overpriced razor company respond by threatening to sue their pants off?
[1:23:34.300 --> 1:23:40.020]  Don't worry. Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants and a relentless dream to give all guys a great shave at a great price
[1:23:40.540 --> 1:23:44.100]  Try Harry's free. They'll send you a razor with five German blades
[1:23:44.380 --> 1:23:51.620]  Boaming shave gel and even a travel blade cover when you sign up just cover shipping plus get a free post shave balm at checkout with code
[1:23:51.620 --> 1:23:58.060]  3434 that's Harry's comm code 3434 to get your free trial set
[1:24:15.620 --> 1:24:17.620]  You know, I know Trump smart
[1:24:17.620 --> 1:24:22.060]  He bypasses the media all the time on Twitter. He needs to do it direct
[1:24:24.380 --> 1:24:28.700]  At least twice a week maybe like Wednesday nights Sunday nights
[1:24:29.980 --> 1:24:32.580]  What I would do 30 minutes to an hour and
[1:24:34.020 --> 1:24:36.820]  Just get up there like Paul Ryan to have it more professionally and
[1:24:37.580 --> 1:24:42.540]  Cover the lies of the media cover the good news cover what's happened in the week cover what's coming up in the week
[1:24:42.540 --> 1:24:49.220]  It's a major weapon Trump should absolutely dominate with not just press conferences or occasional speeches. He gives live
[1:24:50.060 --> 1:24:52.060]  He has his own program
[1:24:52.060 --> 1:24:56.940]  The White House not gov all the networks will carry it. It'll control the narrative
[1:24:57.460 --> 1:25:01.580]  It'll absolutely counter them and bypass them. It is the way to go
[1:25:03.580 --> 1:25:05.580]  Now since I mentioned censorship
[1:25:07.420 --> 1:25:09.260]  The crew was just pointing out that this sort of
[1:25:09.260 --> 1:25:12.700]  group Rockman called
[1:25:12.700 --> 1:25:14.700]  Portugal man
[1:25:14.700 --> 1:25:21.100]  Has this whole dystopic website and there's the the resistance to the right wingers and Alex Jones, basically
[1:25:24.140 --> 1:25:26.140]  and
[1:25:26.140 --> 1:25:28.140]  Again, this is the type of counterculture
[1:25:28.140 --> 1:25:30.140]  Stop there putting out that is not
[1:25:30.140 --> 1:25:32.140]  counterculture
[1:25:32.140 --> 1:25:34.140]  It's all just globalist garbage
[1:25:34.140 --> 1:25:39.500]  Hoping young people look at this and see the beta males that produce it and think oh, I'm cool now
[1:25:42.060 --> 1:25:48.700]  But I'm I'm done attacking it. Let me get into all the other news that's coming up here because there's so much that is important
[1:25:48.700 --> 1:25:50.700]  I need to cover
[1:25:50.700 --> 1:25:56.860]  Let's get to the internet censorship and the internet kill switch. It's basically going into place, but it's also happening in the real world
[1:25:57.820 --> 1:26:00.380]  Internet kill switch activated in slow motion
[1:26:00.380 --> 1:26:03.020]  Special report up on infowars.com
[1:26:03.740 --> 1:26:05.740]  Twitter is now
[1:26:06.300 --> 1:26:08.300]  Making entire profiles
[1:26:08.300 --> 1:26:10.300]  Sensitive and not letting you see them
[1:26:11.500 --> 1:26:15.580]  Well, yeah, and not letting you send your tweets or not letting folks know where you went
[1:26:15.580 --> 1:26:19.500]  This is the massive censorship that they're just phasing in
[1:26:20.300 --> 1:26:22.300]  That's a report from Mashable
[1:26:23.100 --> 1:26:25.100]  Twitter is trying to make
[1:26:26.700 --> 1:26:28.700]  Twitter is trying to make
[1:26:28.700 --> 1:26:33.100]  Twitter is trying to take on its troll problem. Oh see
[1:26:33.820 --> 1:26:38.780]  Anybody they don't agree was a troll in 2017, but the campaign is not without problems
[1:26:39.660 --> 1:26:46.140]  So they don't make it about a censorship good or bad. They just oh, it's an anti troll deal anti fake news deal. No big deal
[1:26:47.420 --> 1:26:50.380]  In addition to a range of tools aimed at filtering abusive tweets
[1:26:50.460 --> 1:26:53.980]  The platform now appears to be quietly marketing entire accounts
[1:26:54.460 --> 1:26:57.580]  Again marking entire accounts as sensitive then it goes over all that
[1:26:57.580 --> 1:27:01.740]  Or they come out in USA today and go, oh, we're just gonna flag stuff
[1:27:01.740 --> 1:27:06.460]  We say is questionable or fake and they ban our articles if it's senator ran Paul on the show or
[1:27:07.020 --> 1:27:12.780]  A former CIA section chief saying they were targeting Trump when it's powerful and credible is when they block it
[1:27:15.900 --> 1:27:17.100]  Meanwhile
[1:27:17.100 --> 1:27:19.100]  I saw another CNN report last night
[1:27:19.580 --> 1:27:23.180]  Where they were saying Trump follows fake news and Alex Jones
[1:27:23.180 --> 1:27:30.380]  He believes it was a TV report but also a print report that there's actually high migrant crime not Islamic invasion crime
[1:27:30.380 --> 1:27:34.620]  But migrant crime taking place in Sweden and there's no evidence
[1:27:35.180 --> 1:27:37.180]  Doesn't matter. It's a national scandal
[1:27:37.260 --> 1:27:41.660]  Doesn't matter if a bunch of police chiefs and others have gone public saying it's an epidemic of murder and killing
[1:27:42.060 --> 1:27:46.300]  And one of them being raped at public events in mass. No, no, no Trump's crazy
[1:27:47.100 --> 1:27:50.220]  He got it from Alex Jones. It doesn't exist. Number one. He didn't get it from us
[1:27:50.220 --> 1:27:53.420]  Everybody's been covering this but number two, it's totally real
[1:27:54.700 --> 1:27:56.700]  But that's the game they play Sweden
[1:27:58.540 --> 1:28:03.740]  Migrants slice woman's throat open murder husband then laugh about it Paul Joseph Watson
[1:28:04.540 --> 1:28:07.580]  And then there's links to the foreign mainstream newspapers
[1:28:07.900 --> 1:28:13.340]  police chief asked for reinforcement or five murders in recent days in an area that never really had murders before
[1:28:15.580 --> 1:28:18.620]  It's terrible what happened last night in Sweden. Oh, what happened nothing happened
[1:28:18.620 --> 1:28:20.620]  Then there was like riots that night
[1:28:21.180 --> 1:28:23.180]  France mayor faces
[1:28:23.900 --> 1:28:28.700]  1,900 euro fine for saying 91 percent of muslim classrooms are a problem
[1:28:30.860 --> 1:28:35.820]  That and that's the classrooms are now in many areas 90 plus percent muslim and by the way they say if you're not a muslim
[1:28:35.820 --> 1:28:40.060]  Don't come in they're not tolerant, but that's okay because we are we're tolerant to be overrun
[1:28:40.060 --> 1:28:47.660]  French mayor charged with crime at expressing concern over muslim takeover of town
[1:28:51.420 --> 1:28:55.260]  Woman gender studies degrees up 300 percent
[1:28:56.780 --> 1:29:01.580]  And you learn when you take these classes how to hate men how to hate yourself and how to roll over to Islam though
[1:29:01.580 --> 1:29:06.780]  Because you know a guy opening a door for you is bad, but if a guy's going to cut your genitals off, that's Islam. That's okay
[1:29:06.780 --> 1:29:13.180]  BBC presenter given warning that we're saying transgender people can never be real women. Yeah, they don't have wombs. They're not real women
[1:29:13.180 --> 1:29:16.700]  You want to identify as that you feel like that hey knock yourself out
[1:29:17.020 --> 1:29:19.020]  Doesn't hurt me. I don't hate you
[1:29:19.580 --> 1:29:23.260]  But don't then try to go teach kids and and recruit
[1:29:23.580 --> 1:29:26.460]  But again BBC presenter given warning you may be kicked off air
[1:29:26.780 --> 1:29:31.260]  So that's the type of censorship and garbage that's going on. We're going to look at incredible developments
[1:29:31.580 --> 1:29:33.820]  The good the bad the ugly on the economy straight ahead
[1:29:33.820 --> 1:29:38.300]  We're going to look more at the huge escalation with korea. That's north korea. The same one
[1:29:38.700 --> 1:29:44.300]  Actually water says russia invaded. No, actually they're threatening to attack japan. They're the problem. We'll be back
[1:29:46.940 --> 1:29:50.940]  We're on the march the empires on the run
[1:29:51.020 --> 1:29:54.060]  Alex Jones and the gcn radio network
[1:29:58.140 --> 1:30:01.980]  You've heard of doomsday bunkers you've heard of secret doomsday airstrips
[1:30:01.980 --> 1:30:07.420]  We've now even heard of entire villages designed for survival in a doomsday scenario see trident lakes in texas
[1:30:07.420 --> 1:30:13.260]  But now the latest plan be marine in new york city is an emergency escape club where the elites of new york can join
[1:30:13.260 --> 1:30:17.740]  Who don't have the time to come up with their own emergency escape plans for annual fee of $90,000
[1:30:17.740 --> 1:30:25.180]  You have access to a gps traceable boat, which is a military style coast guard boat meant to brave harsh conditions and design for deep ocean survival
[1:30:25.180 --> 1:30:30.620]  Which you can also abandon at any time plan be marine will also plan your escape for you catering for your life
[1:30:30.620 --> 1:30:34.220]  And your escape for you catering to each client based on their needs and location
[1:30:34.300 --> 1:30:40.700]  So this is just yet another story of the elites preparing for the worst as well as a growing market for emergency supplies and shelters
[1:30:40.860 --> 1:30:44.220]  With the crazy elites in power it's always been smart to have emergency plans
[1:30:44.380 --> 1:30:50.540]  But now that their new world order is falling apart perhaps the preparedness market will continue to expand in fear the new world order
[1:30:50.540 --> 1:30:54.220]  Will devastatingly act out in a violent act of desperation
[1:30:54.460 --> 1:30:59.420]  This is oan shroyer, and if you're concerned we can help at info war store dot com

[1:32:04.220 --> 1:32:09.420]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most
[1:32:09.500 --> 1:32:14.700]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system
[1:32:14.780 --> 1:32:17.580]  But right now we're dealing with massive
[1:32:18.220 --> 1:32:24.380]  Parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees
[1:32:24.380 --> 1:32:30.620]  Uh spreading disease around we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites
[1:32:30.700 --> 1:32:34.300]  Tell us about all this episode. There's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there
[1:32:34.380 --> 1:32:40.860]  You have the organic clove bud the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year
[1:32:40.860 --> 1:32:43.900]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today
[1:32:43.980 --> 1:32:48.700]  It just came back in yesterday living defense info wars life dot com and folks you can't lose full of stuff
[1:32:48.780 --> 1:32:50.780]  It's great for your body period and
[1:32:50.780 --> 1:32:55.900]  Uh, you support the broadcast info wars lives dot com. Thank you doctor group from the global healing center
[1:32:56.220 --> 1:32:58.220]  Thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product
[1:32:58.220 --> 1:33:17.260]  Waging war on corruption. It's alex jones coming to you right from the front lines of the info war
[1:33:17.260 --> 1:33:33.340]  All right, I'm gonna rampage through a ton of news right now to be absolutely clear and on target
[1:33:34.380 --> 1:33:37.100]  When I say there are a lot of good people in federal agencies
[1:33:37.740 --> 1:33:43.500]  Whether it's transportation or education or the cia or the fbi or defense intelligence
[1:33:44.140 --> 1:33:46.140]  or national intelligence
[1:33:46.140 --> 1:33:52.940]  It's because there are good people. In fact, some of the best people have gotten involved in government trying to make things better from the inside
[1:33:53.660 --> 1:33:56.860]  So there's a paradox that the media plays on that i'm being hypocritical
[1:33:57.020 --> 1:34:01.580]  I thought the government's big and bad and corrupt. You're saying there's all these good people in government. I've always said that
[1:34:03.340 --> 1:34:05.900]  Just like they're good people that work in major corporations
[1:34:05.900 --> 1:34:10.300]  but if you've got bad directors and globalists that have larger plans that are corrupt and you have
[1:34:11.180 --> 1:34:13.900]  policy papers put out by these elites admitting this
[1:34:13.900 --> 1:34:15.900]  Then you've got to resist it
[1:34:17.260 --> 1:34:21.820]  The cia is one of the oldest agencies in this country since the national security act
[1:34:22.060 --> 1:34:26.860]  Army intelligence and naval intelligence all predate that it's been trying to absorb that
[1:34:27.340 --> 1:34:30.060]  Ever since and it was set up basically by blue bloods
[1:34:31.020 --> 1:34:33.020]  and British intelligence
[1:34:33.180 --> 1:34:35.180]  In a not even infiltration
[1:34:35.900 --> 1:34:37.900]  But an agreed upon secret treaty
[1:34:37.900 --> 1:34:44.780]  At the end of world war two to have the united states take over the british empire
[1:34:45.660 --> 1:34:50.700]  And church hill wrote about that. This is not a secret. Okay, but the agreements were a secret at the time
[1:34:51.260 --> 1:34:54.380]  And so the united states was not taken over by england. It was the other way around
[1:34:54.780 --> 1:34:57.900]  The british empire the royals all of them signed over
[1:34:57.900 --> 1:35:08.540]  They were controlled to be partners in the special relationship. And so the united states took over the british empire in 1947
[1:35:09.900 --> 1:35:11.900]  Oss you name it
[1:35:11.900 --> 1:35:14.700]  Now since that happened you see where things have gone
[1:35:16.700 --> 1:35:21.900]  So the cia is an american agency, but it's also a imperial agency
[1:35:21.900 --> 1:35:26.620]  It's absolutely horrible stuff up one side and down the other
[1:35:27.500 --> 1:35:29.340]  But you see a sange
[1:35:29.340 --> 1:35:34.540]  Says rogue cia now targeting americans cia creates its own version of the nsa without permission
[1:35:35.820 --> 1:35:41.020]  And this is a gerum course the article on info wars dot com from a press briefing for a statement
[1:35:41.740 --> 1:35:44.220]  He made this morning, but i want to be clear
[1:35:45.900 --> 1:35:47.900]  The cia
[1:35:47.900 --> 1:35:55.020]  Is not even the main agency it's more the muscle it's the state department
[1:35:56.860 --> 1:35:59.580]  Anybody that knows anything knows that's actually who runs the whole show
[1:36:00.300 --> 1:36:04.140]  And that's why rex tellison is having so much trouble getting anybody to do what he says or find people
[1:36:04.460 --> 1:36:06.460]  Because that's where the real rebellion is
[1:36:06.860 --> 1:36:12.380]  And rex tellison is an executive who knows how to go into companies they take over and make people do what they're supposed to
[1:36:12.380 --> 1:36:14.380]  Is in there in a total war right now
[1:36:14.380 --> 1:36:19.100]  So be clear about that this country is in incredible times
[1:36:19.980 --> 1:36:23.740]  And i'm surprised trump's gotten as much done in 45 days, but he's got to
[1:36:24.300 --> 1:36:26.700]  Because he's got them working around the clock against him now
[1:36:26.700 --> 1:36:31.660]  I don't know all his plans obviously, but this this this bill that's better than obama care
[1:36:31.660 --> 1:36:33.980]  It's still terrible that paul ryan has put forward
[1:36:38.220 --> 1:36:42.860]  Obviously ram paul's plan is a repeal it's great we should go with ram paul's plan it's the best out there
[1:36:42.860 --> 1:36:49.740]  I've been saying that for two years since he first introduced the plan. He's reintroduced it today. That's up on info wars dot com
[1:36:50.380 --> 1:36:52.380]  right now
[1:36:53.500 --> 1:36:55.100]  But to be clear
[1:36:55.100 --> 1:36:57.420]  I've just got to give credit here where credit's due
[1:36:58.220 --> 1:37:00.220]  We wouldn't be as far along
[1:37:01.020 --> 1:37:09.500]  As we are right now if there weren't major rogue elements in the cia and other agencies that helped trump get in who are now becoming the main element
[1:37:09.500 --> 1:37:15.420]  The majority of the cia does not like the globalist knows the plan's evil knows
[1:37:15.420 --> 1:37:19.740]  It's bad don't have chips on their shoulder against free market and don't like communism
[1:37:20.060 --> 1:37:26.380]  But they're controlled by the big foundation appointees that are eugenicists that have this larger breakaway civilization plan
[1:37:26.620 --> 1:37:29.900]  That ends the human species as we know it and so now that this is understood
[1:37:30.540 --> 1:37:33.500]  And the globals were arrogant enough to talk about it. We exposed it
[1:37:33.500 --> 1:37:40.940]  Top-down intelligence agencies and corporate systems have studied the enemy program and have decided they don't want it
[1:37:41.740 --> 1:37:43.740]  So there is a cultural
[1:37:45.180 --> 1:37:51.740]  Rejection a vomiting up of the poison of the new old-order planetary plan the technocracy
[1:37:52.860 --> 1:37:54.860]  Technotronic era program
[1:37:54.940 --> 1:37:58.460]  Uh that brzezinski and others have been haunchoing. They're certainly not the
[1:37:58.460 --> 1:38:02.780]  Progenitors or creators of it. So we're talking the big
[1:38:04.220 --> 1:38:08.540]  Struggle right now the future is being decided on whether it's going to be pro-human
[1:38:09.900 --> 1:38:14.700]  And whether we're going to let ai computers manipulate the internet and human activity and markets
[1:38:15.020 --> 1:38:17.820]  To where they get real control in live time
[1:38:18.460 --> 1:38:21.980]  Of the population that's turned itself over as pawns
[1:38:22.540 --> 1:38:24.540]  To basically be biological androids
[1:38:25.020 --> 1:38:27.020]  or whether we're going to
[1:38:27.020 --> 1:38:33.020]  Start moving into a promotion of cultural information that is truly empowering and enlightening a new renaissance
[1:38:33.180 --> 1:38:35.180]  Which will threaten stagnated elites
[1:38:35.500 --> 1:38:41.260]  But which will save the species and the real debate is he just wipe people out and let the elites do all this
[1:38:41.340 --> 1:38:46.300]  You know breakaway civilization stuff or do you decide to bet on humanity and move forward?
[1:38:47.980 --> 1:38:49.980]  The main reason they're back in office
[1:38:50.780 --> 1:38:55.980]  You could say it's not just from an altruistic perspective or seeing the light and so many of their own operatives realizing
[1:38:55.980 --> 1:38:59.660]  Where the where this tunnel actually goes not to valhalla, but to hell
[1:39:00.860 --> 1:39:04.140]  But the but the bigger issue is the elites themselves understand
[1:39:04.700 --> 1:39:08.860]  They're not going to get away with this plan and then not have large
[1:39:09.500 --> 1:39:12.140]  elements of humans that survive after them
[1:39:14.380 --> 1:39:17.260]  Because they're not going to just kill 80 percent of us they say they're going to kill 99 percent
[1:39:17.500 --> 1:39:21.900]  That's in public documents. Well the elites that thought they were a leader not going what you're going to kill everybody
[1:39:21.900 --> 1:39:27.900]  They're like it's okay. It'll be by the time it's your you know, it'll be your kids
[1:39:28.780 --> 1:39:30.380]  just just
[1:39:30.380 --> 1:39:33.660]  So people are actually sitting back going this doesn't sound too good
[1:39:35.660 --> 1:39:38.700]  Even sociopaths are sitting around going this doesn't sound too smart
[1:39:39.500 --> 1:39:44.300]  And turn everything over to ai. No, let's let's let's let's let's let's let's have a talk about this
[1:39:44.460 --> 1:39:49.020]  They're like no jump off the cliff. Come on. Let's do it. Yeah, I don't think so
[1:39:49.020 --> 1:39:51.020]  So don't just think this is all
[1:39:51.340 --> 1:39:56.140]  You know America and goodness and love and you know, everything's turning around
[1:39:56.460 --> 1:39:59.340]  It's people realizing just how nasty this is
[1:40:00.140 --> 1:40:04.380]  Now there are a lot of good people fighting it and and and we're the shock troops in all this
[1:40:06.380 --> 1:40:10.860]  But the truth is the sociopaths said we didn't count the psychopaths said we didn't count
[1:40:11.020 --> 1:40:16.940]  They said we would be defeated the public was too dumb. They never listened to nationalism or productivity or or
[1:40:16.940 --> 1:40:21.740]  Renaissance or or wanting God back in their lives. They'd rejected it. They'd failed
[1:40:21.740 --> 1:40:27.580]  They'd failed the test humanity was meant to fall humanity was meant to be eradicated in the second fall
[1:40:29.340 --> 1:40:31.660]  But see humanity wasn't meant to
[1:40:32.540 --> 1:40:36.220]  And they can now look at humanity is already overpowering the ai
[1:40:36.540 --> 1:40:42.700]  We're already overpowering their best mind control their chemicals or biologicals. They're radiological super weaponized stuff
[1:40:42.700 --> 1:40:50.700]  Large segments of the public are basically resistant or becoming immune to it. And they the globalists now see the rise
[1:40:53.100 --> 1:40:55.980]  Of the next level resistance and they're already
[1:40:57.100 --> 1:40:59.100]  Evacuating many of them
[1:40:59.100 --> 1:41:02.940]  Because again, the ones in charge are so cowardly so wicked so evil
[1:41:03.180 --> 1:41:10.860]  That they now understand there's a good chance. They're gonna lose so they're already moving to phase two armored redoubts emergency escape ships
[1:41:10.860 --> 1:41:13.420]  Uh underground bunkers. I mean big facilities
[1:41:13.900 --> 1:41:19.820]  Understanding that they may have to have a stage nuclear war bio weapon release. It's gonna be bio like bill gates said
[1:41:20.300 --> 1:41:25.820]  To wipe us out. The problem is if you don't get all of us, we're going to get you because then the gloves are off
[1:41:26.140 --> 1:41:29.100]  It's not like you're gonna release this stuff and act like terrorists did it bill
[1:41:32.140 --> 1:41:36.700]  Bill Gates's wife last year gave a speech in Germany. She said if you don't stop talking about this those of you
[1:41:36.700 --> 1:41:41.100]  Conspiracy theorists saying we're trying to reduce population. We're gonna a lot of people are gonna die
[1:41:42.060 --> 1:41:45.420]  People then the word went out. Well, didn't you get that threaten like oh, I got the threat
[1:41:45.420 --> 1:41:50.620]  You didn't what you just think like we don't know how dangerous it is to go up against you. Oh, oh my god. You threatened us. Oh my gosh
[1:41:50.620 --> 1:41:52.620]  I'm I'm gonna run away scared now
[1:41:53.500 --> 1:41:58.860]  They think we're stupid. They keep going sell out to us back off or we'll get you and it's like
[1:42:00.300 --> 1:42:02.300]  Sell out to killing everybody
[1:42:02.700 --> 1:42:04.700]  Sell out to jumping in
[1:42:04.700 --> 1:42:06.700]  In bed with a bunch of demons
[1:42:07.580 --> 1:42:09.580]  Hell, no
[1:42:09.580 --> 1:42:11.580]  That's not even a question
[1:42:13.980 --> 1:42:18.700]  And people now get they go wow, this isn't really Alex's nightmare vision of things. This isn't paranoia
[1:42:18.700 --> 1:42:25.180]  This is you can go read just the news today and they're all saying this and people are going. Wow. Wow
[1:42:25.740 --> 1:42:29.740]  Wow, if Alex Jones told us 18 years ago about the cameras and microphones
[1:42:29.740 --> 1:42:35.100]  Listening to us if all this is going on, we better go look at what he's talking about. They're like, oh my god
[1:42:35.100 --> 1:42:38.460]  It's worse than you say. It's all true. They admit it. I'm like, yeah, I told you
[1:42:40.700 --> 1:42:42.700]  They're putting cancer viruses
[1:42:43.340 --> 1:42:49.740]  In the polio vaccine in the MMR vaccine in the tetanus vaccines. They've been caught all over the world doing it folks
[1:42:50.460 --> 1:42:52.460]  And the viruses go into your nerves
[1:42:52.460 --> 1:42:59.980]  And then wait till a certain replication point in age of the cells
[1:43:00.780 --> 1:43:06.700]  Some people it's earlier than it's supposed to and it's meant literally to not pay you unemployment or to or to pay you your
[1:43:07.980 --> 1:43:09.980]  retirement money
[1:43:09.980 --> 1:43:13.020]  And there's even white papers and patents and how they did it and
[1:43:13.580 --> 1:43:16.540]  I mean, they gave everybody in Europe the United States and all over the world
[1:43:16.540 --> 1:43:22.940]  Weaponized cancer viruses live virus and and we're all been implanted with with with with
[1:43:23.740 --> 1:43:27.980]  Termination switches and then they can hack and cut and try to stop their own work
[1:43:30.540 --> 1:43:33.580]  And I've done presentations I've made films, you know, I thought about this morning
[1:43:33.580 --> 1:43:37.740]  Should I even sit up here and show you all the documents and articles and how by the 70s
[1:43:37.740 --> 1:43:44.220]  They knew 100 million plus Americans got cancer and most of them died from sv 40 alone
[1:43:44.220 --> 1:43:47.180]  And I'm talking cdc documents. This is public
[1:43:48.060 --> 1:43:54.620]  Oh, see it's a little bit worse than them just watching you. They're putting cancer viruses in the major vaccines
[1:43:55.340 --> 1:44:01.660]  That just like herpes go into the nerves and then activate later upon stress
[1:44:03.100 --> 1:44:06.140]  And they've even tested the viral strains of cancer virus
[1:44:08.380 --> 1:44:10.380]  So that they can again
[1:44:10.380 --> 1:44:15.660]  Inventory with computers down to when it's going to kill the average person. Yes, you've been given
[1:44:18.940 --> 1:44:20.940]  A termination switch
[1:44:21.260 --> 1:44:27.180]  You like that because of course the elite of course the Rockefellers and cold springs harbor that funded hitler publicly
[1:44:27.420 --> 1:44:30.860]  Of course, they're going to implant you with a time bomb weapon
[1:44:31.180 --> 1:44:34.940]  Oh, and by the way, they've got treatments and ways to uh ways to reverse it
[1:44:34.940 --> 1:44:40.700]  But they're not going to tell you that their family gets that not yours. It's up to you to die
[1:44:41.020 --> 1:44:47.420]  You're supposed to roll over so these inbred horrible people can inherit the earth. Well, are you going to do that?
[1:44:54.060 --> 1:44:58.380]  And yeah, you know, I know I talk about horribly frightening things and the enemy thinks that you're like them
[1:44:58.620 --> 1:45:02.300]  Cowards, they think oh, this will just scare people. They don't don't worry about Alex Jones. He's just scaring people
[1:45:02.300 --> 1:45:06.140]  You know, I wasn't talking to the general public that some of what your cowards
[1:45:06.140 --> 1:45:13.500]  I was talking to those in the general public that aren't but I was talking to the intelligentsia who was one level below all this intel
[1:45:14.460 --> 1:45:18.700]  You know, you dumb the public down. You know, you brainwash people. You know, you want to manage group
[1:45:18.860 --> 1:45:22.380]  You know, you're not really liberals your cold-blooded social engineers and you're told
[1:45:22.780 --> 1:45:27.980]  Liberalism is the cover that you do it and but it's for the greater good to stabilize the planet reduce population
[1:45:28.540 --> 1:45:29.580]  but
[1:45:29.580 --> 1:45:33.260]  You didn't get a memo not to give your kid the vaccine though. Did you know see you're meant to die too
[1:45:35.340 --> 1:45:38.380]  And by the way cancer viruses and vaccines is
[1:45:39.500 --> 1:45:41.500]  not even
[1:45:42.060 --> 1:45:48.060]  On a scale of one to ten not even a number two cameras and microphones watching and listening to use not even a point one
[1:45:52.060 --> 1:45:54.060]  You know for 50 years
[1:45:54.060 --> 1:45:59.580]  They've had clones that's now admitted. You know, they've had cameras for 35. They admit
[1:46:00.380 --> 1:46:02.220]  part human part animal
[1:46:02.220 --> 1:46:04.220]  part you name it
[1:46:04.220 --> 1:46:09.660]  You know that right see it just goes on and on on and on on and on and now it's all just gonna start coming out
[1:46:09.740 --> 1:46:14.860]  Because see they can't hide it now. They want to just hide it have a breakaway civilization. You don't even know about it
[1:46:14.860 --> 1:46:19.420]  It's in government reservations corporate reservations now because it's all coming out. They're gonna have a debate about it
[1:46:20.300 --> 1:46:22.380]  and just go, oh, you know

[1:46:29.020 --> 1:46:30.380]  That'll be there. Oh

[1:46:34.860 --> 1:46:36.860]  Here's the deal the big line

[1:46:40.060 --> 1:46:41.980]  When you go along with this you're fooling yourself
[1:46:42.060 --> 1:46:48.540]  Even if you're a top Rockefeller or a Rothschild or somebody, you know a jk. Rawlings is part of the propaganda
[1:46:48.540 --> 1:46:52.300]  Yeah, you you're signing on to

[1:47:22.940 --> 1:47:26.700]  But if you'd come face to face with it, you'd never curl up next to it
[1:47:27.580 --> 1:47:28.860]  But don't worry
[1:47:28.860 --> 1:47:35.420]  God's gonna remove more and more of the protection because you've asked for it and you're gonna get to rub up against it a little closer
[1:47:35.420 --> 1:47:40.860]  Just like those kids that get grabbed out of their backyards and get tortured to death. Sometimes over a couple years
[1:47:41.740 --> 1:47:44.300]  All of you that have served this you have opened the door
[1:47:44.780 --> 1:47:47.740]  To everything you want and you're going to get it
[1:47:48.300 --> 1:47:50.300]  So make no mistake about that

[2:00:48.460 --> 2:00:54.060]  Look at this disgusting pig like rat like sneaky lying anti-question demon
[2:00:54.060 --> 2:00:57.820]  Running around at the vatican and he probably took his little fork tail in
[2:00:58.300 --> 2:01:03.340]  You know, they're they're at the big pervert base pedophile base. You know the vatican's been turned into
[2:01:03.740 --> 2:01:08.060]  I mean, I think nobody denies that on conspiracy theory. There's pedophiles in the vatican
[2:01:08.860 --> 2:01:12.060]  conspiracy theory there there are bats in caves
[2:01:13.020 --> 2:01:15.020]  conspiracy theory there are fish in the ocean
[2:01:15.740 --> 2:01:17.740]  pope
[2:01:17.900 --> 2:01:19.340]  Turd eaters
[2:01:19.340 --> 2:01:22.940]  You know I say that he's one says that those of us that are nationalists are questioned the media
[2:01:22.940 --> 2:01:29.900]  Love feces and have sex with it. Nobody that comes out of your brain. So you are now known as pope poop eater
[2:01:30.460 --> 2:01:36.620]  Oh my god, he's a religious paunt of how delio hate speech. He said hearing about christian roots of europe disgust him
[2:01:36.620 --> 2:01:41.260]  He's a disgusting person. Let's go back to pope poop. Go back to him
[2:01:42.140 --> 2:01:43.340]  please
[2:01:43.340 --> 2:01:46.540]  I'm not really angry mood today. Yeah, let's go to the headline people. He says that
[2:01:47.740 --> 2:01:49.740]  Populism is evil close quote
[2:01:49.740 --> 2:01:55.660]  Pope poopus issued a veiled warning. I think veiled about it about donald trump's
[2:01:56.220 --> 2:02:04.140]  Populism is evil. You have the people being involved the people wanting something the people 1776. There's nothing more terrible
[2:02:05.660 --> 2:02:08.780]  By the way turnabout's fair play. I have free speech. Say whatever I want about the pope
[2:02:09.340 --> 2:02:12.300]  But a lot of people say oh, he's a good communist. So you're not supposed to talk bad about him
[2:02:12.620 --> 2:02:16.780]  He said people that like trump had like to have sex with feces
[2:02:16.780 --> 2:02:22.620]  Okay, he said it three months ago. He said that national is your evil. He said christians in europe are
[2:02:23.500 --> 2:02:28.140]  I mean, it's crazy. Look go be a devil worshiper or something man
[2:02:29.900 --> 2:02:32.860]  To stop saying you're the christian leader
[2:02:34.300 --> 2:02:39.820]  When it's well-known in the one in garden report, they use pedophilia and the scandals to get control of attica and put you in there
[2:02:42.140 --> 2:02:44.140]  I'm not saying you're a pedophile
[2:02:44.140 --> 2:02:49.500]  I'm just saying you know, you can't swing a stick in the dark at the Vatican and not you know, you know not hit
[2:02:50.300 --> 2:02:56.940]  Hit well, you know in sandusky. Uh, pope frances compares fake news consumption to eating feces london guardian. See, I'm not kidding
[2:02:57.820 --> 2:02:59.820]  I'm not kidding folks
[2:02:59.820 --> 2:03:01.980]  They're the ones up in the rhetoric to this level. So
[2:03:02.700 --> 2:03:04.700]  I compare him
[2:03:05.820 --> 2:03:07.820]  To someone that
[2:03:07.820 --> 2:03:11.340]  Has now taken over the Vatican and helped cover up all the priest abuse. That's right
[2:03:11.340 --> 2:03:16.460]  That's right, but it's okay that liberal media leaves him alone now because he says he doesn't like european christian
[2:03:16.540 --> 2:03:21.500]  And wants the borders to be open to muslims to just flood in and do whatever they want and engage in all the different crimes
[2:03:21.500 --> 2:03:26.540]  And I have a whole stack of news here today where they're slitting people's throats and murdering her husband in front of their kids and
[2:03:26.780 --> 2:03:32.460]  raping women in mass and you know five murders a day in little towns now and just total insane bedlam and
[2:03:33.260 --> 2:03:38.700]  Trump says man, you heard what happened in sweden last night. Oh nothing happened in sweden fake news, man
[2:03:38.700 --> 2:03:40.700]  It's crazy
[2:03:41.260 --> 2:03:45.180]  Now I'm starting to settle down a little bit. I've been I've been a little bit angry today and I haven't hit our big story yet
[2:03:45.180 --> 2:03:49.660]  And I'm not doing this on purpose. I just I just I just haven't gotten to it. So I'm gonna hit it when we come back and then go to our guest
[2:03:51.740 --> 2:03:57.180]  Donald trump sends beef to two nuclear bombers in south korea. I don't explain. Oh, this is a big deal after north fires missile at japan and
[2:03:57.180 --> 2:04:01.100]  us warrants of overwhelming response and leftist media. I saw this morning was like
[2:04:01.820 --> 2:04:06.380]  Trump's a warmonger. Trump's out of control. We have a defense treaty with south korea and with
[2:04:06.380 --> 2:04:13.900]  Japan with seol in tokyo and in kim jong-un is a perfect delusional nobody never worked today in his life being worshiped as a god
[2:04:13.900 --> 2:04:15.900]  emperor over his communist hellhole
[2:04:16.300 --> 2:04:19.420]  You know that every little trendy spoil bratt n Austin wants to be part of him serious
[2:04:19.980 --> 2:04:25.100]  Or you know china at least communist chinese they love it. It's just total fruit kicks just begging to be slaves
[2:04:25.500 --> 2:04:28.380]  And so he's threatening to attack everybody. So this is an escalation
[2:04:28.940 --> 2:04:34.060]  Again, another precious little kami threatening to start world war three and now it's dead
[2:04:34.060 --> 2:04:36.060]  Donald trump's fault. He just moved nuclear weapons
[2:04:36.620 --> 2:04:39.980]  Uh, you know, so they can be launched and dropped on top of his head in 30 minutes
[2:04:40.860 --> 2:04:44.380]  The communist chinese asked for all this. They're using north korean to stir stuff up
[2:04:44.700 --> 2:04:50.540]  And china who the united states built up who the globalists put commies in charge of this needs to sit down and shut up
[2:04:51.100 --> 2:04:54.780]  China you can't even keep your own house in order. You're a bunch of blood drinkers
[2:04:54.780 --> 2:05:04.220]  Katie perry is now in a real estate dispute with nuns over an iconic multi-million dollar convent los feliz in los angeles
[2:05:04.220 --> 2:05:09.340]  The stunning property was built in 1927 and perry has offered over 14 million dollars for the property
[2:05:09.340 --> 2:05:14.380]  Problem is sister rita callahan and sister kathryn holsman claim the property is theirs to sell
[2:05:14.380 --> 2:05:18.700]  Having been the occupants there and part of the order of the immaculate heart of the blessed virgin mary
[2:05:18.700 --> 2:05:21.660]  And they won't sell it to perry because they don't like her lifestyle
[2:05:21.660 --> 2:05:24.780]  A kind way of saying she's a satanic witch
[2:05:24.780 --> 2:05:29.820]  But the greedy archdiocese of l.a. Claims it is theirs to sell and they want to sell it to perry for the exorbitant price
[2:05:29.820 --> 2:05:33.260]  perry tried to play coy with the sisters saying she has a jesus tattoo
[2:05:33.260 --> 2:05:37.660]  But they called her out on her other tattoos her performances and her attendance at a salem witch walk
[2:05:37.660 --> 2:05:43.260]  Which conveniently she couldn't recall they also brought up this statement from perry. I want it to be like the amy grand of music
[2:05:43.260 --> 2:05:47.900]  But it didn't work out and so I sold my soul to the devil
[2:05:47.900 --> 2:05:53.100]  This case has now reached the highest legal authorities in the catholic church. Guess we will see where their loyalties lie
[2:05:53.100 --> 2:06:21.100]  For info wars.com. This is Owen shroyer
[2:06:21.100 --> 2:06:27.260]  The caveman is those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors

[2:06:29.660 --> 2:06:35.100]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal you use the meat for sustenance the fat for cooking
[2:06:35.100 --> 2:06:43.340]  But you use the bones for strength from the outside structure full of minerals and kiko factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body
[2:06:43.340 --> 2:06:49.020]  This is the engine of the life essence. I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were
[2:06:49.020 --> 2:06:54.060]  I'm sure as well trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it

[2:08:25.740 --> 2:08:31.580]  And I don't mind them switching sides and standing up the things they believe in
[2:08:33.020 --> 2:08:37.900]  He was part of a produced video by prayer university called why I left the left that got millions of years
[2:08:37.900 --> 2:08:43.100]  It's one of the few people when I would watch the young turks occasion I could actually listen to I'm not just saying that
[2:08:43.740 --> 2:08:47.980]  The arrogance the ignorance of the other people it was like watching
[2:08:50.140 --> 2:08:53.820]  You know folks with a third grade education tell me how you rocket science
[2:08:54.700 --> 2:08:58.860]  Or moon landings you know operate and I'm not claiming I'm some super intellectual
[2:08:59.020 --> 2:09:02.300]  But what is this thing on the left where they're just these geniuses that
[2:09:02.940 --> 2:09:06.540]  Know everything and everybody else is an idiot and everybody else is a moron
[2:09:06.540 --> 2:09:10.780]  And then I go out on the streets at these anti-trump demonstrations, and it's like day of the dead
[2:09:10.780 --> 2:09:12.780]  And I don't mean just a few people
[2:09:12.780 --> 2:09:15.820]  Half of them seem like they've gotten out of mental institutions
[2:09:16.860 --> 2:09:21.740]  You'll have hundreds of men come by and go f you white male when they're white guys. They're totally racist
[2:09:22.460 --> 2:09:23.580]  against
[2:09:23.580 --> 2:09:28.300]  White people which is just racism to begin with and none of it makes sense. It's like mass insanity
[2:09:28.540 --> 2:09:33.100]  I never called myself a conservative the media did because I was pro-gun and pro sovereignty
[2:09:33.100 --> 2:09:39.580]  But I a lot of stuff the left was for uh, you know decriminalization of marijuana. I don't want a bunch of wars
[2:09:40.060 --> 2:09:42.540]  Uh, remember remember I was a big liberal they said when bush was in
[2:09:43.180 --> 2:09:44.700]  That wasn't the case
[2:09:44.700 --> 2:09:46.140]  but man
[2:09:46.140 --> 2:09:49.660]  There are so many zombo videos that even our crew shoots in austin
[2:09:50.220 --> 2:09:54.380]  That I can't even play them all it's not like we're cherry picking and I mean tongues hanging out
[2:09:54.380 --> 2:10:01.980]  Like in the 1970s remake of the body satchels man. Hey, we can find that where peter southerland, you know, she goes. Oh, it's you he goes
[2:10:03.420 --> 2:10:05.420]  Plain setter I'm not kidding
[2:10:05.820 --> 2:10:10.860]  I'm not kidding and they won't talk to you. They won't give you ideas and they just scream races races races racist
[2:10:11.740 --> 2:10:14.940]  And if we've got reporters that are minorities they'll scream the same thing at them
[2:10:15.900 --> 2:10:18.060]  It is I don't know what it is
[2:10:18.780 --> 2:10:20.540]  uh, but
[2:10:20.540 --> 2:10:22.620]  It's like one of the ladies on the young turks
[2:10:22.620 --> 2:10:26.540]  When they invited me up. I'm walking by at the rnc
[2:10:29.020 --> 2:10:31.420]  And I mean I I could do interviews all day if I wanted to
[2:10:32.620 --> 2:10:37.020]  And they say hey you want to come on the show one of their minions. I'm like yeah, we're coming back later
[2:10:37.020 --> 2:10:39.740]  So then I thought I was invited. I did jump up without asking
[2:10:40.860 --> 2:10:42.860]  Think it'd be fun a lot of folks were doing that
[2:10:43.340 --> 2:10:45.820]  And then they blow up then they say roger stone wanted to get on there
[2:10:45.820 --> 2:10:49.580]  He was like 30 feet away and wouldn't come on then they lied said roger stone
[2:10:49.580 --> 2:10:54.220]  Let me tell you what just happened about 10 minutes ago. You see roger stone tried to rush up here without shows
[2:10:54.300 --> 2:10:58.140]  And I wasn't putting up with that. No, I jumped up on stage. He didn't do that
[2:10:59.420 --> 2:11:04.220]  And and so and then it was all I'm a racist and they say you're a fat effing this and that
[2:11:04.860 --> 2:11:07.580]  I don't call people fat f's. I mean I've been overweight myself
[2:11:08.540 --> 2:11:12.620]  I think it's okay to criticize people that you know say I'll weigh 800 pounds if I want you're gonna pay my medical bills
[2:11:12.700 --> 2:11:14.540]  But I don't hate fat people
[2:11:14.540 --> 2:11:16.300]  I've lost like 80 pounds in the last five years
[2:11:16.300 --> 2:11:20.540]  But the point is is that there's such hypocrites and they're so
[2:11:21.100 --> 2:11:25.020]  They're banning whiteboards at colleges all over the country because someone might write something
[2:11:25.260 --> 2:11:28.860]  And that's like saying get rid of books. Someone might write something get rid of paper
[2:11:29.580 --> 2:11:32.380]  It's like a new dark age and I'm a christian
[2:11:33.420 --> 2:11:37.820]  But I like you know the christian either actually read the bible about christ and all that I totally love christ
[2:11:38.140 --> 2:11:43.020]  I love jesus christ. I don't love the interpretation of the church is growing up telling me i'm a devil
[2:11:43.020 --> 2:11:46.620]  I'm going to hell so they're up on some high horse. So I kind of figured it out
[2:11:46.780 --> 2:11:50.780]  And I know it's other people already figured it out, but I understood more and more it's like this is like
[2:11:51.420 --> 2:11:54.940]  This is like being screamed at you're going to hell, but it's a liberal hell
[2:11:55.660 --> 2:11:59.340]  And they're the authority and you're the center, but instead of being a you know
[2:12:00.060 --> 2:12:05.420]  Of the devil that's influencing me. It's all this evil right-wingness and the fact that I even exist you see
[2:12:06.460 --> 2:12:08.460]  And so it is by every
[2:12:09.020 --> 2:12:12.620]  Form a cult they want to control the language. There's always new language you're supposed to use
[2:12:12.620 --> 2:12:17.660]  They're telling you you can't be male or female or that might hurt somebody. I mean this is mass insanity
[2:12:17.660 --> 2:12:23.580]  I know there's social engineering involved, but I think it's gotten away from what even gloria steinham admitted at the cia
[2:12:23.900 --> 2:12:26.140]  They were doing you know with trying to break the family up
[2:12:26.620 --> 2:12:30.380]  So joining us for the rest of the hour is dav ribbon on youtube a ribbon report
[2:12:31.500 --> 2:12:34.460]  And of course, I just love the fact that he's already more popular on average
[2:12:35.180 --> 2:12:40.540]  You know then the young turks who've been around for years and had google behind them and youtube behind them and I should add
[2:12:40.540 --> 2:12:43.100]  We have been banned off google
[2:12:44.140 --> 2:12:46.140]  Adroll now that subcompany
[2:12:46.780 --> 2:12:49.980]  We're getting blocked on twitter and facebook so the big age of censorship here
[2:12:50.220 --> 2:12:56.460]  So thank god we're on over 200 radio stations and thank god we have our own website info wars.com because listen folks
[2:12:56.860 --> 2:13:02.700]  It's intensifying and we've seen more censorship the last month ourselves than we saw the previous five years
[2:13:02.780 --> 2:13:04.540]  So listen, it's accelerating
[2:13:04.540 --> 2:13:08.140]  It's bad and there may come a time very soon where you can't even hear us on the internet
[2:13:08.140 --> 2:13:13.660]  Because they're taking right barred off their their apps. I mean this is systematic. Okay, so I talked to Dave Rubin
[2:13:13.660 --> 2:13:16.700]  We haven't preplanned this just about the state of the world where this is going
[2:13:17.020 --> 2:13:19.580]  How he went from being a quote leftist because I get it
[2:13:19.740 --> 2:13:22.620]  He's be some good on the left to just saying these people are insane
[2:13:22.940 --> 2:13:25.900]  And where is this going because it seems like in any cult like islam
[2:13:26.060 --> 2:13:30.540]  It's got to get more and more radical because the most radical then becomes whoever is in control
[2:13:30.540 --> 2:13:37.980]  So it's like the left is like a sun imploding. It's like the gravity is a black hole and the very worst now
[2:13:38.140 --> 2:13:43.180]  The most mentally ill are in charge. So Dave Rubin. Uh, great to have you here with us today
[2:13:43.420 --> 2:13:45.900]  Of course, uh, great to see on the Joe Rogan podcast as well
[2:13:46.460 --> 2:13:48.060]  Yeah, it's good to be with you, Alex
[2:13:48.060 --> 2:13:52.300]  And by the way, I think you might be suffering from a little ptsd because of what happened at the rc
[2:13:52.300 --> 2:13:57.660]  You forgot to mention that one of their guys spit in your face and then ran away. So
[2:13:57.660 --> 2:14:03.340]  Uh, you know, this is the tolerance of the left and and before we even start here
[2:14:03.340 --> 2:14:07.020]  I should say that, you know, the amount of crap that I'm going to get for even talking to you
[2:14:07.260 --> 2:14:09.420]  Even though as you just said we planned none of this
[2:14:09.660 --> 2:14:14.780]  I spoke to your guy for literally 10 seconds to check audio. Obviously, you're not going to control what I'm going to say
[2:14:14.860 --> 2:14:19.740]  I'm not going to control what you're going to say. Oh the left always says we're colluding because they would make us have hours of meetings
[2:14:19.740 --> 2:14:23.260]  Before they talk go ahead. Yeah. Yeah, and we don't so we're going to do this
[2:14:23.340 --> 2:14:27.020]  I have no idea what you're going to ask me. I as you know, I'm a free speech absolutist
[2:14:27.020 --> 2:14:30.780]  We we can go anywhere. I'm happy to do that. I want you to you're a smart guy
[2:14:30.780 --> 2:14:34.140]  I really want to hear wherever you want to go. I've got plenty of stuff to get into all I'm saying is
[2:14:34.300 --> 2:14:39.580]  They're like raging authoritarians calling us fascists when I always really thought of myself as a classical liberal
[2:14:40.140 --> 2:14:46.060]  Well, look classical liberal that really is the new political term that people have to understand that
[2:14:46.300 --> 2:14:52.780]  Liberalism at its core is about live and let live now that has nothing to do with the modern left
[2:14:52.780 --> 2:15:00.300]  That is about authoritarianism that is about the collective that wants to judge us all on these immutable characteristics of color and race and
[2:15:00.860 --> 2:15:02.780]  ethnicity and sexuality and
[2:15:02.780 --> 2:15:07.020]  Gender and all of these things they keep telling everyone else that they're the racists
[2:15:07.020 --> 2:15:11.820]  They're the bigots and yet they're constantly focused on those immutable traits
[2:15:12.220 --> 2:15:14.220]  I view the
[2:15:14.220 --> 2:15:20.860]  Individual as the most important thing. I only judge you Alex Jones on your thoughts and your actions
[2:15:20.860 --> 2:15:25.820]  So if you say something that's smart and enlightened and that I agree with that's fantastic
[2:15:25.820 --> 2:15:29.660]  And if you say something that's that's nuts and crazy, then I would disagree with you
[2:15:29.660 --> 2:15:31.660]  But I don't think that you Alex Jones
[2:15:32.300 --> 2:15:34.300]  represent white people or
[2:15:34.380 --> 2:15:37.980]  43 year old men or guys who live in Austin or any of that stuff
[2:15:37.980 --> 2:15:43.660]  I think you represent you that is the heart of liberalism that that sounds a lot like modern-day libertarianism and we can get it
[2:15:43.980 --> 2:15:47.660]  It's Martin Luther King thinking about that. Yeah. Yeah, I mean it's simple
[2:15:47.660 --> 2:15:51.100]  I go to a restaurant whether white people black people own it if the food's good
[2:15:51.260 --> 2:15:53.660]  I buy music no matter what color they are if I like it
[2:15:53.980 --> 2:15:58.460]  I always thought that was what was liberal is if you were open to anything that you liked and enjoyed
[2:15:58.620 --> 2:16:02.940]  And you were tolerant of others not you will use our exact words and you will do exactly as we say
[2:16:03.500 --> 2:16:03.980]  Of course
[2:16:03.980 --> 2:16:09.820]  And now they've tricked you to think that if you're a white guy wearing dreadlocks that you're somehow racist and you're culturally
[2:16:10.300 --> 2:16:14.540]  Appropriating and if you eat Chinese food, I mean it's it's insane
[2:16:14.540 --> 2:16:21.500]  But what you said earlier about the black hole I think is an interesting analogy here because it will never end
[2:16:21.980 --> 2:16:26.380]  There is no end to this hole. This is what I've tweeted this a lot that there's no bottom here
[2:16:26.460 --> 2:16:30.220]  They're never going to get to a place where they go. Okay. We got what we wanted
[2:16:30.220 --> 2:16:36.860]  We got the control we wanted and we have utopia because what they're telling you is that if only their guys were in power
[2:16:36.860 --> 2:16:41.420]  If only Bernie was in power and Keith Ellison was in power and all of these far left guys
[2:16:41.420 --> 2:16:45.980]  If only they were in power magically society would be fantastic. Well, exactly
[2:16:45.980 --> 2:16:49.100]  But they're trying to bring an actual anti language anti-communication
[2:16:49.820 --> 2:16:55.660]  Anti-debate the only place I see that is in the most hardcore cults make you follow only set language
[2:16:55.900 --> 2:17:02.700]  It's always changing. They're always persecuting and you know pulling somebody out to peck on them and surround them and bully them
[2:17:02.860 --> 2:17:08.540]  I mean everything they say they're against is what they are and I'm asking you because you've been inside with these people
[2:17:08.540 --> 2:17:13.740]  What the hell's going on because there's some of the best comedy out there until you realize
[2:17:13.820 --> 2:17:20.300]  It's so dangerous and they've got our kids in schools. Yeah. Well, look, you know, the road to hell is paved with good intentions
[2:17:20.300 --> 2:17:27.740]  So I don't think that on face value that all of these people are inherently bad people who are trying to you know, bring some
[2:17:28.140 --> 2:17:29.660]  authoritarian
[2:17:29.660 --> 2:17:33.580]  Communist socialist control. I don't think they even realize what they're doing
[2:17:33.580 --> 2:17:39.340]  I think most of the people we can talk about some of the leaders and the higher ups and some of the people in media who you mentioned
[2:17:39.580 --> 2:17:43.580]  But I think the average person that is into these ideas truly believes
[2:17:44.060 --> 2:17:49.980]  That uh minorities are oppressed in america that that women are oppressed in america that muslims are oppressed in america
[2:17:50.140 --> 2:17:55.420]  We live in the freest greatest society that there is. I would not want to live in any other country
[2:17:55.580 --> 2:17:59.980]  I I'm a married gay man. I don't want any extra credit for it. I wanted equal rights
[2:17:59.980 --> 2:18:03.740]  Now I got it and now I want to be able to vote the way anyone
[2:18:03.740 --> 2:18:06.860]  Now let me ask you this. Have you gotten a bunch of hate from right wingers for that?
[2:18:08.060 --> 2:18:12.220]  No, I mean the truth is I haven't the truth is I haven't and that and that's a great point
[2:18:12.220 --> 2:18:14.060]  and I'm glad you asked it because
[2:18:14.060 --> 2:18:16.380]  All I've gotten even every single day
[2:18:16.460 --> 2:18:21.180]  I'd be glad to forward you emails later so that you know, I'm not making this up every single day
[2:18:21.580 --> 2:18:25.820]  I get emails from christian conservatives in the middle of the country saying, you know what, Dave?
[2:18:25.820 --> 2:18:31.660]  You're you're liberal. You're gay blah blah blah. I tend not to agree with you on this or that. You're not a believer
[2:18:32.140 --> 2:18:38.060]  But I absolutely respect your opinions the way you treat your show the way you talk to your guests
[2:18:38.300 --> 2:18:41.740]  I've sat across here in my studio is in my home. I have a home studio
[2:18:41.900 --> 2:18:48.060]  I've sat across from people who've told me that they don't believe in gay marriage as they're in my home where I live
[2:18:48.540 --> 2:18:52.940]  Bishop baron who's from the archdiocese here in la. We had an incredible discussion about it and guess what?
[2:18:52.940 --> 2:18:58.060]  I didn't feel the need to get him to admit that he was for gay marriage
[2:18:58.060 --> 2:19:02.460]  We had a great discussion about and you didn't hit him over the head like they do at these Berkeley events
[2:19:02.460 --> 2:19:07.260]  Where they're they're now pepper spraying tasering people in Missouri. It's getting real. I'm really worried. It's it's
[2:19:08.460 --> 2:19:11.740]  Do you think the the violence is escalating and and if so why?
[2:19:12.220 --> 2:19:14.860]  Yeah, well look it can only get worse unless
[2:19:15.340 --> 2:19:20.300]  The the true roots of liberalism come back and and look I do believe that that's happening
[2:19:20.300 --> 2:19:26.700]  But we have a ton of work to do but look if you've pinned all of your intellectual opponents as racists and bigots and
[2:19:27.020 --> 2:19:33.340]  Islamophobes and blah blah blah if you've done that repeatedly you keep pinning yourself into a box and then eventually
[2:19:33.740 --> 2:19:36.860]  What happens the only way you can get out of that box is violence
[2:19:37.020 --> 2:19:42.220]  So that's why when Richard Spencer who I would probably disagree with on virtually everything, right?
[2:19:42.620 --> 2:19:48.220]  He still has a right though as a white nationalist to go around just like a Mexican nationalist has the right in metro
[2:19:48.220 --> 2:19:53.740]  La Raza same group just different skin color same ideology just of different perspective that they don't deserve to be beat up
[2:19:54.460 --> 2:19:58.540]  Absolutely, and that's the whole point of free speech if free speech everyone says well
[2:19:58.540 --> 2:20:00.060]  I'm for free speech I'm for free speech
[2:20:00.060 --> 2:20:04.700]  But then suddenly when someone says something that they don't like like Richard Spencer then it's okay to punch Nazis
[2:20:04.780 --> 2:20:07.900]  That was and then have msm promote organized violence
[2:20:08.060 --> 2:20:13.500]  That was what was very Nazi like was to have the news organizing violence against a group you don't like
[2:20:13.500 --> 2:20:19.820]  Right, so this concept is crazy. So okay, so if you say all right Richard Spencer's a Nazi now first off
[2:20:20.060 --> 2:20:23.500]  I'm not even defending Richard Spencer. I'm defending his ability to speak that's number one
[2:20:23.580 --> 2:20:25.580]  Because if he loses his we lose ours
[2:20:25.580 --> 2:20:31.980]  But of course and what and what the ultimate end game of this what the what the next logical step is so you have people saying they can't speak
[2:20:32.300 --> 2:20:34.300]  Okay, now you move sure
[2:20:35.580 --> 2:20:37.740]  This is key when I was growing up and in college
[2:20:37.900 --> 2:20:42.220]  It was the right wing that wanted to curtail free speech a little bit and I was against it and didn't like that
[2:20:42.220 --> 2:20:47.180]  It was the left that would always defend it. They were the ones that would say let the kkk march and I'd go out and protest them
[2:20:47.180 --> 2:20:52.380]  There's video since when did we get that the left who was always the defenders of free speech turn into that and they get back to the other point
[2:20:52.860 --> 2:20:59.020]  Yeah, well, it's look everything is changing. We're in a major horseshoe theory moment right now where the two sides are
[2:20:59.340 --> 2:21:02.380]  You know the fringes are really becoming one crazy thing
[2:21:02.620 --> 2:21:07.180]  So I would say that the the left has gotten much worse just in the last five years alone
[2:21:07.180 --> 2:21:12.540]  And it obviously has a lot to do with the way they treat Islam which Islam as a doctrine as a set of ideas
[2:21:12.860 --> 2:21:14.620]  It's a hugely
[2:21:14.620 --> 2:21:16.140]  Regressive idea
[2:21:16.140 --> 2:21:21.660]  Yet they the progressives somehow treated at the top of their oppression olympics as if it's the most virtuous thing
[2:21:22.060 --> 2:21:22.940]  This this is crazy
[2:21:22.940 --> 2:21:26.380]  But but getting back to the earlier point the idea about punching nazis
[2:21:26.380 --> 2:21:30.780]  So if you say okay, they can't speak well now you say all right if they do speak we're allowed to punch them
[2:21:30.780 --> 2:21:35.340]  Well, what are you really saying what you're really? You know when when Richard Spencer got punched he could have been killed
[2:21:35.340 --> 2:21:39.500]  Right. I mean the guy could have hit him in a way that cracked his head on the concrete
[2:21:39.820 --> 2:21:43.020]  Yeah, could have been killed and I've seen people killed getting hit like that
[2:21:43.980 --> 2:21:45.980]  Exactly. So what you're saying then is okay
[2:21:46.140 --> 2:21:51.260]  Actually, you can kill people that you label nazis and then if you say that well, are we allowed to blow up his house?
[2:21:51.340 --> 2:21:53.660]  Can you what if his kids there how about his family?
[2:21:54.620 --> 2:22:00.060]  All of those things and then you got to keep going with the logic and this is what the left unfortunately doesn't do
[2:22:00.060 --> 2:22:07.900]  Well, what's next if if I Dave Rubin a liberal if I sit down with someone considered to be alt right who they'll now label a nazi
[2:22:08.060 --> 2:22:10.060]  Now can you come after me? Am I okay?
[2:22:10.620 --> 2:22:13.020]  As the subject of violence and this is the problem
[2:22:13.180 --> 2:22:17.260]  It is a slippery slope and by the way, it's going to come for everybody
[2:22:17.340 --> 2:22:19.820]  What what they don't realize is that Bernie Sanders
[2:22:20.460 --> 2:22:25.900]  Is a uh is a rich white man with three houses. He just got a new one on a lake
[2:22:25.900 --> 2:22:30.620]  Uh, he has 300 one day Bernie Sanders will say something that goes against them
[2:22:30.860 --> 2:22:33.340]  And he will be the enemy because this is an ideology
[2:22:33.740 --> 2:22:40.060]  Rooted in constant new oppression and you have to find new enemies to attain power. Let me raise this next question then
[2:22:41.500 --> 2:22:46.540]  Obviously race-based politics works. That's why it's gone all over the world in history or religion based
[2:22:47.020 --> 2:22:48.540]  um
[2:22:48.540 --> 2:22:52.220]  So now the left where the democrats in words is 60 years ago
[2:22:52.220 --> 2:22:57.980]  They're going back to race-based politics, but with the minorities and trying to basically invoke this of the drudge report
[2:22:57.980 --> 2:23:01.260]  As an article today with with the univision a host on their
[2:23:01.900 --> 2:23:07.420]  Ramos the George Ramos, you know basically saying hey, we're the new people. We're the majority get used to it
[2:23:08.300 --> 2:23:11.820]  But again, why are you identifying as Hispanic? I would identify as an american
[2:23:12.060 --> 2:23:18.780]  So you got property rights religious rights gun rights and all those other stuff. I would want that birthright. See i'm thinking about their brains
[2:23:18.860 --> 2:23:20.860]  Not what color they are
[2:23:20.860 --> 2:23:21.660]  Uh
[2:23:21.660 --> 2:23:26.860]  So then you expand from there. Why would the left and I think this is their jump the shark moment
[2:23:27.260 --> 2:23:33.260]  Openly embrace Islam you expose it. I expose it others expose it horror was first exposed it accurately
[2:23:33.260 --> 2:23:36.140]  I didn't believe it 12 years ago when I read his book on holy alliance
[2:23:36.140 --> 2:23:39.500]  It was so crazy that the left was going to be ally, but I guess his parents were communist
[2:23:39.500 --> 2:23:44.140]  He knew they come out and say we are allied with it. We're spreading it. It's good
[2:23:44.540 --> 2:23:48.460]  All women should wear the hijab and they have tv ads in europe the u.s
[2:23:48.460 --> 2:23:53.180]  Saying join the most radical forms of Islam, which is the most monotheistic
[2:23:54.140 --> 2:23:55.500]  oppressive
[2:23:55.500 --> 2:23:58.860]  A male hierarchy thing on earth stone age level
[2:23:59.340 --> 2:24:02.220]  Beyond that crazy town crap. I have multiple daughters
[2:24:02.220 --> 2:24:08.540]  I mean it fundamentally pisses me off and then they tell me i'm an effing white male that hates women and at feminist marches
[2:24:08.700 --> 2:24:14.860]  They're running around saying Allah Akbar, which is illegal in an Islamic country. So i'm just saying this is total insanity
[2:24:14.860 --> 2:24:19.660]  What's going on here? Yeah. Well, you know first to that to the Jorge Ramos point, you know, it was interesting
[2:24:19.660 --> 2:24:22.300]  I saw the clip and he said it's not their country. It's ours
[2:24:22.540 --> 2:24:28.220]  But that's exactly what he would say they're saying to him. So this is a very huge flaw in logic
[2:24:28.220 --> 2:24:32.460]  There's a big jump that's missing. Yeah, the whites are saying this is our country. He's saying no, it's ours
[2:24:32.860 --> 2:24:37.500]  Well, no, the whites really aren't saying that they don't want brainwashed leftist Hispanics driving down
[2:24:37.980 --> 2:24:42.460]  Wages running around with the social justice warriors. Thank god though. It's not mainly Hispanics
[2:24:42.460 --> 2:24:46.380]  Why do you think mainly the people running around being the big bullies or you may disagree?
[2:24:46.540 --> 2:24:48.540]  Why is it mainly white people and white women?
[2:24:49.500 --> 2:24:55.820]  Well, I think the the coming after white people and coming after Christian people and anyone that has any sort of
[2:24:56.380 --> 2:24:59.020]  You know traditional views on life or anything
[2:24:59.340 --> 2:25:05.980]  It's just incredibly easy and that goes back to what I said earlier about how I get all this mail now from from Christian
[2:25:06.460 --> 2:25:11.500]  Conservatives and conservatives of all sorts of religions and believers and not believers saying that I have traditional values
[2:25:11.500 --> 2:25:13.500]  I disagree with you on all this stuff
[2:25:13.820 --> 2:25:17.580]  But I like your ability to sit there and have a conversation because that's what liberalism is
[2:25:17.740 --> 2:25:22.060]  Going after Christians is absurdly easy because guess what they're not going to kill you
[2:25:22.380 --> 2:25:26.140]  They're not going to kill you and in most cases actually these days
[2:25:26.380 --> 2:25:31.180]  They don't silence you either and and the proof of that is look what's going on on the college campuses
[2:25:31.180 --> 2:25:37.180]  Of course, I know you know this but you know, wherever Milo speaks and now it's gone to from Milo to Ben Shapiro to
[2:25:37.180 --> 2:25:42.380]  You know Charles Murray and plenty of other people and I've been protested which is completely absurd
[2:25:43.100 --> 2:25:46.300]  Yeah, why do they have no idea that what they're doing looks horrible?
[2:25:47.420 --> 2:25:48.380]  I don't think they care
[2:25:48.380 --> 2:25:55.660]  I don't think they care because if you if everyone that you disagree with echo chamber proven that they're a racist and a
[2:25:55.820 --> 2:25:57.820]  Bigot and a Nazi and a homophobe
[2:25:57.900 --> 2:26:01.820]  Then then you're morally right and that also goes to what you said earlier about this site
[2:26:01.900 --> 2:26:06.060]  It's become a religion. These are the people that are supposed to be anti-religion right?
[2:26:06.060 --> 2:26:11.020]  They hate religion that who do they hate the most they hate Christian conservative like the most oppressive zealots
[2:26:11.020 --> 2:26:16.220]  I've ever seen yeah, and look and then when you when you toss Islam into this and I know it's very important
[2:26:17.020 --> 2:26:21.260]  That we separate Islam which is a set of ideas and adoption versus Muslim people
[2:26:21.260 --> 2:26:24.540]  There are millions and millions and I'm not just I had a lot of great friends in college
[2:26:24.540 --> 2:26:25.420]  It's still to their Muslim
[2:26:25.420 --> 2:26:30.940]  But they were people that fled it and you know their moms and sisters aren't wearing hoods over their heads and can have a life
[2:26:30.940 --> 2:26:38.300]  Exactly. I don't want like super poor third world orthodox oppressive women can't come out without hoods on their heads
[2:26:38.540 --> 2:26:40.220]  That's not acceptable
[2:26:40.220 --> 2:26:43.020]  Well, not only not acceptable not only is it not acceptable
[2:26:43.020 --> 2:26:47.100]  But look, you know, you can look at this woman Linda Sarsour who is now a hero of the left
[2:26:47.420 --> 2:26:52.540]  Who if you look on her, you know, she was arrested because uh yesterday at trump tower, I guess
[2:26:53.020 --> 2:26:58.300]  For public disorder or whatever it is. Uh, but she's a hero of the left. Oh, there you go. You got it up right there
[2:26:58.300 --> 2:27:04.860]  She's the fourth from the left. This woman has repeatedly defended sharia law publicly on twitter
[2:27:05.500 --> 2:27:09.900]  And not only that she's attacked ian herciali. There's a tweet. She's since deleted it
[2:27:09.900 --> 2:27:12.620]  She's also blocked me on twitter, of course because I called her out on it
[2:27:12.860 --> 2:27:18.620]  But she attacked ian herciali and and and said that something's the effect of she shouldn't have a vagina
[2:27:18.860 --> 2:27:22.380]  Now I I'm sure you're familiar with ian herciali. She's a Somali
[2:27:22.940 --> 2:27:26.220]  Refugee who underwent female genital mutilation. That's incredible
[2:27:26.220 --> 2:27:32.060]  Okay, not only did she then she was going to be married. I think at 14 years old to her own cousin in Somalia
[2:27:32.300 --> 2:27:37.580]  She fled Somalia eventually makes it to holland where where she's thrilled with freedom
[2:27:37.580 --> 2:27:42.620]  She becomes a member of parliament and what happens her friend theo van Gogh vinson van Gogh's grandson
[2:27:43.020 --> 2:27:48.700]  Uh, who's doing a documentary on islam and free speech and some other stuff is killed in the middle of the street in broad daylight
[2:27:48.860 --> 2:27:51.820]  They pin a note saying ian we're coming for you next
[2:27:52.060 --> 2:27:54.780]  She's now moved to to the states here and now is
[2:27:54.780 --> 2:27:58.540]  The perhaps the one of the greatest people on earth defending
[2:27:59.180 --> 2:28:05.020]  True feminism defending true western values and liberalism and who's she hated by she's hated by the left
[2:28:05.100 --> 2:28:09.020]  And let's expand on that because women under orthodox islam or stockholms syndrome
[2:28:09.900 --> 2:28:15.340]  They're allowed to go out and bully the women in islam and now I guess women in the west into submitting to it
[2:28:15.500 --> 2:28:18.380]  It's like a weird form of cuckolding or something
[2:28:18.780 --> 2:28:19.820]  You know people don't know what that is
[2:28:19.820 --> 2:28:22.460]  I guess this is where you let like 10 guys have sex with your wife in front of you
[2:28:22.460 --> 2:28:25.420]  There seems to be like this bizarre hatred of the west
[2:28:25.660 --> 2:28:30.620]  So if we bring in the most radical forms of islam and then hold it up and accept it and then let them
[2:28:30.700 --> 2:28:34.940]  As i've been at the rallies in new york and dc and austin they're being led by
[2:28:35.660 --> 2:28:39.420]  Radical islamicist and i'm like is this really happening?
[2:28:39.820 --> 2:28:46.300]  But the the thing is they don't know what's happening what they think that they're doing and this is why intentions matter and and I and
[2:28:46.460 --> 2:28:51.500]  It's important for us and for people that actually use logic and reason to look at these people and not say
[2:28:51.500 --> 2:28:53.500]  Okay, they're all inherently evil
[2:28:53.820 --> 2:28:59.100]  What's happening is they think that that muslim people are being oppressed whatever that means now
[2:28:59.180 --> 2:29:03.660]  We have no laws against muslim people. I have muslim friends. I had muslim friends over
[2:29:03.740 --> 2:29:04.220]  No, I got it
[2:29:04.220 --> 2:29:08.700]  But there's a lot of muslims that don't don't don't get in the melting pot. They want to make us submit
[2:29:09.340 --> 2:29:10.300]  Sure, absolutely
[2:29:10.300 --> 2:29:14.220]  And that's why we have to fight ideology because if you think about the truth of it
[2:29:14.540 --> 2:29:20.220]  Is that in any place that islam the doctrine of islam spreads whether it means whether we're talking about in the middle east
[2:29:20.220 --> 2:29:24.540]  Or we're talking about in all these places in europe that are having these huge problems right now in paris
[2:29:24.780 --> 2:29:28.940]  And in london and in brussels. No, wait Trump's lying. The media said nothing's happening there
[2:29:29.180 --> 2:29:32.220]  Stay right there. Dave rubin's our guest on youtube rubin report
[2:29:32.620 --> 2:29:35.020]  And we'll give you his website also when we come back as well
[2:29:35.020 --> 2:29:41.900]  We're gonna get into this and and where he sees the you know the real classical left versus this new weird cult left
[2:29:42.220 --> 2:29:46.540]  Where all this is going and then to see the so-called right wing being so tolerant and open
[2:29:46.540 --> 2:29:52.460]  I think the left's bizarreness was really a way to educate the right wing. We're on the march the empires on the run
[2:29:53.340 --> 2:29:56.140]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:30:00.060 --> 2:30:03.660]  You've heard of doomsday bunkers you've heard of secret doomsday airstrips
[2:30:03.740 --> 2:30:09.260]  We've now even heard of entire villages designed for survival in a doomsday scenario see trident lakes in texas
[2:30:09.340 --> 2:30:13.340]  But now the latest plan b marine in new york city is an emergency escape club
[2:30:13.340 --> 2:30:19.100]  Where the elites of new york can join who don't have the time to come up with their own emergency escape plans for annual fee of
[2:30:19.180 --> 2:30:22.060]  $90,000 you have access to a gps traceable boat
[2:30:22.060 --> 2:30:27.100]  Which is a military style coast guard boat meant to brave harsh conditions and designed for deep ocean survival
[2:30:27.100 --> 2:30:33.500]  Which you can also abandon at any time plan b marine will also plan your escape for you catering to each client based on their needs
[2:30:33.500 --> 2:30:39.580]  In location so this is just yet another story of the elites preparing for the worst as well as a growing market for emergency
[2:30:39.580 --> 2:30:44.140]  Supplies and shelters with the crazy elites in power. It's always been smart to have emergency plans
[2:30:44.220 --> 2:30:46.380]  But now that their new world order is falling apart
[2:30:46.460 --> 2:30:50.620]  Perhaps the preparedness market will continue to expand in fear the new world order will
[2:30:51.180 --> 2:30:54.140]  Devastatingly act out in a violent act of desperation
[2:30:54.300 --> 2:30:59.260]  This is oan shroyer and if you're concerned we can help at info wars store dot com

[2:32:35.020 --> 2:32:43.180]  But you use the bones for strength from the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body
[2:32:43.260 --> 2:32:45.740]  This is the engine of the life essence

[2:33:15.420 --> 2:33:20.220]  Now I don't want to get into bashing the young church because they've got their own thing and they had their own
[2:33:20.220 --> 2:33:24.220]  Islamist has funded tv show and
[2:33:25.180 --> 2:33:28.140]  They had their own thing on youtube back by youtube and pushed by youtube
[2:33:28.140 --> 2:33:33.820]  But the reason it's important is youtube google more and more is censoring they're coming in with controls
[2:33:33.820 --> 2:33:37.500]  They admit they're doing it twitter and facebook are really bad and that's just not right
[2:33:37.900 --> 2:33:39.900]  But I have seen their popularity wane a lot
[2:33:40.460 --> 2:33:44.060]  Uh because it's just it's just the left is so ridiculous now
[2:33:44.060 --> 2:33:50.220]  So we're going to talk with our guest dave rubin of dave rubin dot tv here in just a moment and get into some of the other news around the world
[2:33:50.220 --> 2:33:52.620]  Talk about north korea talk about government worship
[2:33:53.740 --> 2:33:55.740]  And so much more but before we do that
[2:33:56.380 --> 2:34:00.780]  We have a lot of great nutraceuticals and these are developed by the top scientists in the world
[2:34:00.780 --> 2:34:04.780]  That's why third party sites give us five stars like power reviews. You name it
[2:34:05.420 --> 2:34:09.900]  We have come out after 10 years of research with dr. Group with the myco zx
[2:34:09.900 --> 2:34:14.380]  It supports a normal fungal and yeast balance which is out of control of most people in their gut
[2:34:14.620 --> 2:34:20.380]  Flushes all that out proprietary blend of herbs and enzymes. I'm able high quality ingredients 120 capsules
[2:34:20.620 --> 2:34:24.540]  This is discounted 10 out of the gates because by the way, it's going to sell out in like two three days
[2:34:24.620 --> 2:34:30.140]  I'm I'm as estimated again underestimated. It's like the toothpaste. It's so popular that that's sold out to mere days
[2:34:30.140 --> 2:34:31.260]  More of that's going to come in soon
[2:34:31.260 --> 2:34:36.780]  But notice I don't just say stuff selling out for artificial scarcity or you know, I mean this is really happening
[2:34:36.780 --> 2:34:41.820]  Uh, sometimes we go six months before something comes in as we can't get the ingredients and have it to the top organic
[2:34:42.540 --> 2:34:43.820]  level so
[2:34:43.820 --> 2:34:45.820]  It goes great with the biome defense
[2:34:45.820 --> 2:34:49.180]  Probiotic that is the very best that we have it's refrigerated. We sent it to you
[2:34:49.660 --> 2:34:51.260]  Refrigerated you don't have to keep it refrigerated
[2:34:51.260 --> 2:34:58.780]  But it's 50 billion live cultures and the extra strength 25 billion in the in the regular formula goes together perfectly info wars store.com
[2:34:59.100 --> 2:35:02.780]  The herbicides the pesticides in the environment. They kill the good flora in your gut
[2:35:02.780 --> 2:35:08.700]  Biome defense will displace the bad bacteria. That's what it's designed to do
[2:35:09.900 --> 2:35:11.900]  Because you've lost the good ones, but
[2:35:12.460 --> 2:35:17.500]  Myco zx goes in with a healthy known herbs and and enzymes and knocks out
[2:35:18.220 --> 2:35:21.980]  The yeast and the mold and all the rest of garbage that is wreaking havoc
[2:35:21.980 --> 2:35:23.820]  I'm going to put out the full interview yesterday
[2:35:24.460 --> 2:35:25.980]  from dr. Group

[2:36:31.020 --> 2:36:33.020]  If I seem a little desperate at times
[2:36:33.100 --> 2:36:38.380]  It's it's we're winning a lot of hearts and minds and good and nationalism is exploding and good things are happening but
[2:36:39.340 --> 2:36:41.340]  They've painted themselves in a corner
[2:36:42.060 --> 2:36:44.060]  As Dave Rubin just said 10 minutes ago
[2:36:44.620 --> 2:36:49.740]  Whether it's the pope or whether it's it's Merkel in Germany or Lawn in in France or whoever
[2:36:49.740 --> 2:36:58.300]  The pope says if you like Trump you you like having sex with with feces. I mean, I'm not kidding. That's a quote or if you're for nationalism
[2:36:58.700 --> 2:37:06.140]  Uh, you know, you're a horrible person. The quote was nationalism and populism is evil and then Glenn Beck goes on CNN and says I'm very scared of nationalism
[2:37:06.140 --> 2:37:08.140]  What what what are you talking about?
[2:37:09.020 --> 2:37:14.300]  We barely don't even have a country. So what they're saying is don't even have a country. You just don't even have any rules have nothing
[2:37:14.300 --> 2:37:19.260]  But then they worship countries like North Korea or Venezuela where the state has got
[2:37:19.980 --> 2:37:25.420]  Then they say today in the news. Trump's a warmonger. Look, Japan's begged for us to send beefy tube bombers with nukes
[2:37:25.740 --> 2:37:29.900]  They fired a bunch of missiles over the coast of Japan. They've almost hit the country. They're threatening to nuke it
[2:37:29.900 --> 2:37:36.540]  They're threatening to attack the south seol. It's only 25 miles from the border. They got a hundred thousand pieces of artillery aimed at it
[2:37:38.140 --> 2:37:42.540]  This is your communist dreamland with a third generation hereditary
[2:37:42.540 --> 2:37:45.900]  Dictator put a crown on the guy and it's donald trump's fault
[2:37:46.780 --> 2:37:51.500]  Japan considers first strike options against north korea since the first time since 1945
[2:37:51.740 --> 2:37:57.660]  Changing their constitution because kim jong-un disconnected his brother, you know got caught trying to defect to disney world
[2:37:57.660 --> 2:38:03.980]  I'm not kidding in japan. So he just got assassinated two weeks ago vx nerve gas for darryl. Just try to go to disney world
[2:38:04.780 --> 2:38:09.980]  That's that that's this cult and the the only place I see liberals crying and screaming in europe and here
[2:38:09.980 --> 2:38:11.980]  It's roba
[2:38:11.980 --> 2:38:13.980]  Is when kim jong-il died
[2:38:13.980 --> 2:38:18.940]  I'm not kidding the only parallels. I see here. Let's have some audio is is in
[2:38:18.940 --> 2:38:21.420]  Hardcore Stalinist regimes
[2:38:22.780 --> 2:38:28.220]  And so again when I say cult I don't say this is a joke if the left by successive approximation
[2:38:29.420 --> 2:38:31.420]  Letts themselves
[2:38:31.420 --> 2:38:33.420]  Just get into
[2:38:33.420 --> 2:38:37.980]  Getting into whatever the media tells them to act like and do and then you know quomo says. Hey, you know if your daughter
[2:38:37.980 --> 2:38:42.620]  Doesn't like seeing a man's penis at tranny in her school bathroom. She's got a problem. She's
[2:38:43.180 --> 2:38:47.180]  She's she's not open. What the hell are you talking about? So
[2:38:47.580 --> 2:38:52.220]  It's a control trip. They want to dominate. They want to control us other people get bullied into it
[2:38:52.220 --> 2:38:55.820]  I've been ranting. You've got the floor here. Uh, dav rubin
[2:38:56.220 --> 2:38:59.180]  Again who defected uh, I get not from north korea, but from
[2:38:59.740 --> 2:39:05.100]  The young turks helped go down and kill the armenians. Why do they have that name? He denies that happened
[2:39:05.100 --> 2:39:08.700]  You know, I mean what the hell's going on?
[2:39:09.660 --> 2:39:12.860]  Yeah, I mean look I as far as the name of the show
[2:39:13.180 --> 2:39:19.500]  Look, I didn't even realize at the time when I started working there that there was this whole thing about the denial that he had written
[2:39:19.500 --> 2:39:20.940]  This thing denying it
[2:39:20.940 --> 2:39:26.940]  Subsequently, he's been challenged on it many times. I I don't even you know, he's a relevant buffoon
[2:39:26.940 --> 2:39:29.100]  But the church did kill over a million armenians
[2:39:29.340 --> 2:39:32.540]  Well, look the group that that formed in the ottoman empire
[2:39:32.540 --> 2:39:36.940]  That was trying to bring about revolution was known as the young turk
[2:39:36.940 --> 2:39:40.540]  So the idea that the name of the show doesn't have anything to do with it is kind of
[2:39:41.020 --> 2:39:44.540]  By the way, by the way for the people that criticized me. Well, they say Dave you work there
[2:39:44.940 --> 2:39:51.340]  Uh, I did not I I swear to you. I was not aware of this until the summer after I had left already
[2:39:51.820 --> 2:39:56.620]  Uh, was the hundredth anniversary of the armenian genocide and that's when all the news about this started bubbling up
[2:39:56.620 --> 2:40:01.340]  Most people don't don't know those little factoids unless you were armenian and this is undisputed
[2:40:01.340 --> 2:40:07.100]  Uh, eat it by the young turks to murder the armenian. So this is this is undisputed. Go ahead
[2:40:07.660 --> 2:40:11.020]  You know, you can look there's a there's a quote from hitler, which I'm going to slightly butcher
[2:40:11.020 --> 2:40:15.260]  But he said when people said well, wait a minute, how are you going to get away with killing all the jews in europe?
[2:40:15.500 --> 2:40:21.020]  He said well, look the look what the turks did to the armenians. They got so people can find that quote
[2:40:21.020 --> 2:40:21.980]  That's real but real quick
[2:40:21.980 --> 2:40:25.820]  I want to back up a second because you came in from commercial with the steve miller band
[2:40:25.980 --> 2:40:28.860]  And I just to prove that I don't go easy on the right
[2:40:28.860 --> 2:40:33.580]  I was at a steve miller concert about a year ago in orange county here outside la
[2:40:33.980 --> 2:40:40.860]  And uh, there's it's pretty known as a conservative place and I was busted at a steve miller outdoor concert for smoking weed
[2:40:41.180 --> 2:40:47.180]  By some some angry, you know, right wing conservatives. So I want to be clear on this
[2:40:47.420 --> 2:40:52.540]  I am for liberty. I can smoke some. No, absolutely. I'm not absolutely. I'm for decriminalization as well
[2:40:52.540 --> 2:40:55.900]  There's a lot of hypocrites on the right. They're just not as it is viral
[2:40:55.900 --> 2:40:58.860]  So so getting back to you. I mean, I don't want to talk about the young turks all day
[2:40:58.860 --> 2:41:04.300]  It's just the arrogance and just from what I've seen it's I'm not just saying this it seems like maybe I'm wrong
[2:41:04.940 --> 2:41:06.940]  Even their own fans are turning against them
[2:41:07.740 --> 2:41:12.380]  Oh, yeah, I mean I I see a ton of that but that's because the left is not liberal anymore
[2:41:12.700 --> 2:41:18.540]  And if you once you realize that once that little piece gets pulled out
[2:41:18.780 --> 2:41:25.340]  The deco card starts crumbling real quick and you realize wait a minute. Why is this always about more and more control?
[2:41:25.340 --> 2:41:29.500]  Progressives constantly scream about government, right?
[2:41:29.660 --> 2:41:34.620]  Government is wrong now and trump is evil and and obama was evil when he was in charge and
[2:41:34.780 --> 2:41:40.860]  George bush, of course was evil and all that but what's the the answer? It's always more government. This makes no sense
[2:41:40.940 --> 2:41:45.660]  It's only if they're magical people could just be in charge then everything would be okay
[2:41:45.900 --> 2:41:48.700]  It's it's a fake utopia that doesn't exist
[2:41:48.700 --> 2:41:55.820]  Yeah, venezuela and north korea and communist russia all these places are hellholes authoritarianism big government always brings hell on earth
[2:41:55.820 --> 2:41:58.300]  And a little fat guy waddling around the generals
[2:41:58.940 --> 2:42:01.580]  Yeah, look, there's plenty of things if you want to go into it
[2:42:01.580 --> 2:42:06.220]  We can discuss plenty of things that uh that we like or dislike about trump and have a healthy debate on that
[2:42:06.620 --> 2:42:12.860]  But right now is trump coming for someone's freedom. Are you a not the the threat to free speech right now?
[2:42:12.860 --> 2:42:15.980]  Does that seem like it's coming from trump or is it coming from the left?
[2:42:15.980 --> 2:42:19.100]  Now we can talk about what trump's doing with some of the media stuff
[2:42:19.500 --> 2:42:25.580]  Uh, but the simple fact is the media has been horrible the idea that for the last eight years
[2:42:25.580 --> 2:42:31.420]  They had this white house correspondence dinner, which now trump's not going to do that showed you they were throwing it in our face
[2:42:31.500 --> 2:42:36.620]  How corrupt they were oh the washington post everybody says we've entered a great time of darkness and evil and attack on the press
[2:42:36.940 --> 2:42:40.780]  Trump's just said he's going to bypass the press main streamers are a bunch of liars
[2:42:40.780 --> 2:42:46.780]  That's not censoring them. They've posted articles and op-eds in every major newspaper. I've seen saying kill trump
[2:42:47.100 --> 2:42:50.140]  Have riots overthrow things beat people up
[2:42:50.380 --> 2:42:53.100]  They've got the faculty at these universities is in the news
[2:42:53.500 --> 2:42:55.980]  Bailing out the people that attack men women and children
[2:42:56.220 --> 2:43:03.340]  So so the claim that he's at war with speech when the left is the one trying to control speech and beating people up is just crazy
[2:43:03.740 --> 2:43:06.540]  Well, by the way, if he if he was first censoring the media
[2:43:06.540 --> 2:43:11.100]  He would be trying to shut down news organizations now. I would be for
[2:43:11.740 --> 2:43:14.380]  A huge opening of the white house press corps
[2:43:14.540 --> 2:43:18.860]  So I would let in a lot of new organizations, which by the way, he has let in some, you know
[2:43:18.860 --> 2:43:22.380]  Some people were saying well, he's censoring the new york times and cnn and a few others
[2:43:22.540 --> 2:43:27.820]  He didn't let them into the gaggle, which is an off the record thing that they do after you're not automatically entitled to that
[2:43:27.980 --> 2:43:31.180]  Now all that being said does he have an authentic authoritarian streak?
[2:43:31.180 --> 2:43:37.500]  Absolutely. Do I like all of the executive orders? No, and I didn't like them under obama and I didn't like them under george w
[2:43:37.500 --> 2:43:44.220]  Bush I think we should actually be governed by the constitution, which means that the legislative branch congress should write law
[2:43:44.220 --> 2:43:46.220]  But they keep advocating their responsibilities
[2:43:46.300 --> 2:43:50.940]  So at least Trump's using the executive power to transfer power like tpp killed that back to the people
[2:43:51.340 --> 2:43:57.580]  So alex that right there that's a great meaty place to have a conversation that congress is abdicating their power
[2:43:57.580 --> 2:44:03.340]  There where are the laws that are they had they tried to pass any law since trump has become now finally
[2:44:03.340 --> 2:44:07.740]  They're trying to do this repeal, but it's not even repeal. It's another screw job. The republicans cooked up
[2:44:08.300 --> 2:44:13.340]  Yeah, look and we all of course we should all be for single payer. That's the most sensible thing that there is some
[2:44:13.900 --> 2:44:16.700]  It's it's a combination of public and private now
[2:44:16.700 --> 2:44:20.220]  I get it if you're a pure libertarian in in the purest sense
[2:44:20.380 --> 2:44:22.220]  You want the government to have nothing to do with it
[2:44:22.220 --> 2:44:28.700]  But in a functioning state that we have that a single payer makes the most sense where we have private insurers and it's just sort
[2:44:28.700 --> 2:44:32.700]  Of facilitated by the government. I personally think that's okay
[2:44:32.700 --> 2:44:35.900]  But I but I'm happy to to argue with people on whether that's okay
[2:44:35.900 --> 2:44:39.100]  But the point is the meaty part of this is what you hit on a second ago
[2:44:39.100 --> 2:44:45.340]  Which is we have three branches of government one supposed to write laws one supposed to sign them into law and one supposed to confirm
[2:44:45.340 --> 2:44:49.660]  Whether they're legal or not and what we're doing and what the presidents have done now for a long time
[2:44:49.660 --> 2:44:52.540]  Is funnel all of that power to the executive?
[2:44:52.940 --> 2:44:59.900]  So for now the left is freaking out because the executive was their god when it was a democrat or a republican they controlled
[2:45:00.140 --> 2:45:05.580]  Now they're totally freaked out because they've transferred all the power to the executive and now they're completely freaked out by trump
[2:45:06.140 --> 2:45:11.820]  Exactly. So then what what's the answer to that the answer isn't oh, it's only okay when it's your guy
[2:45:11.900 --> 2:45:15.340]  So transfer power back to the states back to the congress or back to the people
[2:45:15.340 --> 2:45:20.940]  But trumps actually trying to get them to do a healthcare bill. They don't even want to do the congress is the worst group
[2:45:20.940 --> 2:45:25.340]  I mean, there's no doubt that they literally just want to pass authority on and just be lazy
[2:45:25.820 --> 2:45:30.060]  Yes, you're a hundred percent right. That's the answer. The answer is return
[2:45:30.540 --> 2:45:36.140]  To what our founders wanted which was limited federal control if you don't like trump
[2:45:36.220 --> 2:45:38.860]  And there are many reasons not to like him if you don't like him
[2:45:38.860 --> 2:45:45.980]  The answer isn't to try to upend democracy to try this this hashtag resistance and to literally try to impeach
[2:45:45.980 --> 2:45:47.980]  What are you saying? You want to impeach him and then we'll impeach
[2:45:48.540 --> 2:45:52.220]  Pence and then we're going to install hillary or a democrat. I mean, what are you actually by the way
[2:45:52.300 --> 2:45:54.380]  They even talk about disconnect a day ribbon
[2:45:54.940 --> 2:45:59.580]  They all shown show folks. He's tuned in again a day ribbon of the day ribbon report on youtube hit show
[2:45:59.980 --> 2:46:02.140]  formerly with the young turks the young turds as I call them
[2:46:02.140 --> 2:46:09.660]  Where does this go from that point because they're trying to say the state's god now exactly they want to remove
[2:46:10.060 --> 2:46:17.420]  Trump but then they actually say michael more said we want to install hillary back in who's like a walking dead zombie
[2:46:17.980 --> 2:46:25.020]  Incredibly corrupt. Nobody wants the bushes. Nobody wants the Clintons. What's the elite thinking if they had to run some half decent person
[2:46:25.180 --> 2:46:29.420]  They would have beaten trump again. They're so entitled not just the grassroots of the left
[2:46:29.420 --> 2:46:32.620]  But the elite of it are just are just crazy
[2:46:33.180 --> 2:46:38.540]  Well, think about what michael more said. I mean really you have to take everything as before we said there's no bottom with the left
[2:46:38.540 --> 2:46:45.420]  Well, every time that they that anyone gives you a fact you have to take it to where they use the word install
[2:46:46.140 --> 2:46:51.340]  Right. Okay, so let's say let's just say we impeach trump. We get rid of pence. The whole administration goes down
[2:46:51.740 --> 2:46:54.060]  Somehow I don't think there's any legal way we could do it
[2:46:54.060 --> 2:47:00.780]  But somehow we install hillary as president or just any democrat. We we you know grab biden's old bones. He's now president
[2:47:01.020 --> 2:47:03.020]  Well, what's the next step the next step is
[2:47:03.580 --> 2:47:09.420]  You would basically be saying we now have to go to war with russia because they installed a puppet president
[2:47:09.900 --> 2:47:11.020]  in the united states
[2:47:11.020 --> 2:47:17.020]  So if that happens guaranteed guaranteed, we go to war with russia. I can tell you right now
[2:47:17.180 --> 2:47:21.260]  I don't want to go to war with russia. I see no reason to go to war with russia
[2:47:21.260 --> 2:47:23.900]  I was about to say if russia was expanding threatening us
[2:47:24.700 --> 2:47:30.300]  Russia can barely stabilize itself clearly china and islam radical islam or the existential threats
[2:47:31.500 --> 2:47:36.540]  Yeah, well look four years ago. What happened. It was about five years ago now in that debate when when uh
[2:47:37.100 --> 2:47:41.420]  Barack obama said to mit romney after he said that rush is our biggest geopolitical foe
[2:47:41.820 --> 2:47:43.180]  obama said I want
[2:47:43.180 --> 2:47:46.380]  You know, you want the 80s foreign policy back now, obviously
[2:47:46.380 --> 2:47:51.820]  There is some stuff going on with russia and we have to treat that we have to be transparent about it and figure out
[2:47:51.820 --> 2:47:53.420]  What's going on here really?
[2:47:53.420 --> 2:47:59.260]  But the the bigger point is that if you give these these protesters if you give them what they want
[2:47:59.420 --> 2:48:05.260]  It really is dismantling of democracy. So the iris. Let me ask you this. They believe their bullying and intimidation is going to work
[2:48:05.500 --> 2:48:07.660]  I don't see that happening the democrats
[2:48:08.620 --> 2:48:13.500]  Five years ago. They would have delivered probably put the republicans out of business except for a regional group in the south
[2:48:13.500 --> 2:48:18.940]  I think they're they were right now. They're the party that lost almost all the state houses the governor ships the house of senate
[2:48:19.100 --> 2:48:24.060]  And it's a total collapse as steve bannon has said if they deliver on prosperity and kind of a populist
[2:48:24.460 --> 2:48:29.100]  Conservatism but are also inclusive what trump's doing this whole family a lot of them are liberals
[2:48:29.260 --> 2:48:33.660]  But real liberals it's it's going to break the back of the collectivists. So where do they go?
[2:48:33.660 --> 2:48:36.220]  I mean, let me ask david a smart guy that's joining us right now
[2:48:36.460 --> 2:48:40.540]  What are the different paths, you know, kind of like choose your own adventure novels working in like three ways
[2:48:40.540 --> 2:48:45.100]  What are the different avenues we're going down here? Well, first off just to your point about trump's family
[2:48:45.500 --> 2:48:48.860]  I had donald trump jr. On my radio show a couple years ago way before
[2:48:49.740 --> 2:48:51.260]  You know trump was running for president
[2:48:51.260 --> 2:48:57.660]  I was on the out cue channel the lgbt channel on serious xm because that's where they they threw me as a gay person
[2:48:57.660 --> 2:49:03.580]  Even though I wanted to do politics, but that's fine. Oh, yeah, the left does that where we're like they pigeonhole you and say who you are
[2:49:03.900 --> 2:49:08.940]  Exactly. Yeah, so I had donald trump jr. On his dad. This is way before his dad's running for president
[2:49:08.940 --> 2:49:13.260]  And we asked him about gay marriage and he said at the time he said that he donald trump jr
[2:49:13.260 --> 2:49:16.460]  Was a hundred percent for it. He said I know my dad is not for it
[2:49:16.540 --> 2:49:20.540]  This is a couple years ago said my dad is not for it, but my dad has always taught us
[2:49:21.180 --> 2:49:25.580]  To say what we think and believe what we believe and I thought that's a pretty good mark
[2:49:25.900 --> 2:49:30.940]  Of of a person and by the way for I've been trying to explain to my friends on the left for quite some time now
[2:49:31.180 --> 2:49:33.660]  That the idea that trump is anti gay is insane
[2:49:33.660 --> 2:49:38.460]  Not only is he a lifetime new yorker who obviously was surrounded by plenty of gay people?
[2:49:38.620 --> 2:49:43.180]  He got a standing ovation at the rnc at the acceptance speech when he mentioned gay rights
[2:49:43.420 --> 2:49:45.420]  He had peter teal is one of his
[2:49:45.420 --> 2:49:51.580]  Good friends and closest confidence right now who's who's openly gay obviously and peter teal was at the rnc said
[2:49:51.580 --> 2:49:56.380]  I'm a proud gay man got a standing ovation for it and and what did trump do?
[2:49:56.460 --> 2:49:58.780]  He also, you know, prekept the lgbt work
[2:49:58.780 --> 2:50:03.660]  Well exactly and and and some right wingers people say this is horrible don't do this the point is the left has groups
[2:50:03.740 --> 2:50:08.860]  They think they own creating all the hate and making us all hate each other when there's no reason to do that
[2:50:09.180 --> 2:50:13.420]  And it's a cult so trump is unifying the country. That's what we need
[2:50:13.980 --> 2:50:18.940]  So alex this is this is a great point also because I know that just by appearing here with you
[2:50:19.020 --> 2:50:21.900]  I am going to get a pretty decent level of hate
[2:50:21.980 --> 2:50:26.620]  Oh people are going to say oh you're with alex jones and they'll send me videos that you scream in and they're going to say
[2:50:26.620 --> 2:50:28.860]  Is now the context stuff right so so
[2:50:29.820 --> 2:50:34.140]  Oh be that as it may they're just gonna a certain amount of people just not they're not going to listen to anything
[2:50:34.220 --> 2:50:35.980]  We said they're not going to counter any of the ideas
[2:50:36.060 --> 2:50:41.580]  They're just going to throw hate and that is for those of us that actually whether we agree or disagree politically
[2:50:41.580 --> 2:50:46.860]  But for those of us who want a better country based in our own ability to build a better society
[2:50:46.860 --> 2:50:47.980]  We need to start talking to each other
[2:50:47.980 --> 2:50:52.620]  But yeah, we got to start talking exactly that's what the colleges used to be was an open discussion
[2:50:52.620 --> 2:50:57.980]  Now that the most uninclusive place. How did we come here final second with our guests and john revamport coming up?
[2:50:57.980 --> 2:50:59.980]  I'm alex jones
[2:51:00.220 --> 2:51:05.420]  This is the story of the shaving company called harry's in an epic battle of david versus goliath
[2:51:05.820 --> 2:51:11.900]  In the early 1980s a child was born two of them actually their names were jeff and andy time went by
[2:51:12.220 --> 2:51:17.900]  They developed facial hair and one day something happened and he got ripped off buying overpriced razors
[2:51:17.900 --> 2:51:23.500]  So they decided to start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all they hired the best designers
[2:51:23.740 --> 2:51:30.780]  They bought a 95 year old german blade factory and they started selling high quality razors online with no up charging direct to customers
[2:51:31.180 --> 2:51:33.180]  How did the overpriced razor company respond?
[2:51:33.500 --> 2:51:35.500]  By threatening to sue their pants off
[2:51:35.740 --> 2:51:41.260]  Don't worry jeff and andy have plenty of pants and are a relentless dream to give all guys a great shave at a great price

[2:54:06.700 --> 2:54:10.060]  We'll be joining us and hosting the fourth hour a lot of news i haven't got to yet
[2:54:10.060 --> 2:54:15.260]  I'm gonna hit the next segment now the news is tonight seven o'clock central. Look whether you
[2:54:16.940 --> 2:54:21.180]  Like people that are islamic or you like people that are orthodox jews or you know
[2:54:21.180 --> 2:54:23.180]  You know orthodox hinders whatever
[2:54:23.180 --> 2:54:27.100]  There are groups that are nice and aren't violent there are groups that are but when you look at islam
[2:54:27.180 --> 2:54:29.420]  It's like a thousand to one any other group. It's violent
[2:54:29.980 --> 2:54:33.500]  Every once in a while is there's some christian does something. Yeah, there's some you know the name of the
[2:54:34.060 --> 2:54:38.780]  Christianity so i don't say all this to attack islam islam has been completely radicalized. It's been
[2:54:39.420 --> 2:54:41.420]  absolutely turned into this weapon
[2:54:41.420 --> 2:54:43.420]  and then the left and i was
[2:54:45.020 --> 2:54:47.660]  You know kind of late to coming to the fact that islam was so out of control
[2:54:47.660 --> 2:54:52.380]  I didn't want these wars any of it because i knew it would actually stir it up, but now this alliance with the left
[2:54:52.460 --> 2:54:54.460]  It's just it's too much
[2:54:54.620 --> 2:54:58.060]  But it's the same thing people that want to sit there and bash people for their sexual preferences or whatever
[2:54:58.060 --> 2:55:02.380]  Because it makes them feel good. I don't really ever hear that or see that my i've heard that some growing up
[2:55:02.380 --> 2:55:03.900]  But but very rarely
[2:55:03.900 --> 2:55:07.020]  The left wants to exaggerate all that to make groups feel bad
[2:55:07.420 --> 2:55:11.580]  So they can go be in the globalist leftist cult and that's why being inclusive
[2:55:12.220 --> 2:55:17.340]  Is so important folks now once the left is inclusive they add a hundred new genders to imaginary stuff
[2:55:17.340 --> 2:55:22.620]  So you can never be inclusive enough. It's kind of like adding new new you know new versions of a video game
[2:55:22.780 --> 2:55:24.780]  You know to where it's basically unwinnable
[2:55:25.100 --> 2:55:27.340]  But it's just going into total insanity and
[2:55:27.740 --> 2:55:31.180]  Trump's doing the right thing. I don't like the fact you support this healthcare bill
[2:55:31.420 --> 2:55:35.260]  You know i think it's better than obama care, but not you know not what we said we want to repeal
[2:55:35.660 --> 2:55:38.380]  And i think trump's letting us have a debate on that but but overall
[2:55:39.020 --> 2:55:42.540]  I would have rooted for obama if he was trying to turn our jobs back on and stuff
[2:55:42.780 --> 2:55:45.660]  I mean i don't want to fight republicans or democrats or anybody
[2:55:45.660 --> 2:55:51.260]  I really want prosperity in the future for my children. Dave ribbon. Where do you see this world going closing comments?
[2:55:51.980 --> 2:55:55.980]  Yeah, well first off I checked my twitter during during the break there people are telling me
[2:55:55.980 --> 2:55:59.740]  I got to ask you about these gay frogs. Is there anything I need to know real quick? Absolutely
[2:56:00.060 --> 2:56:06.460]  Yeah, no they take clips out where I covered a bbc article where they said they would drop gay bomb pheromones on the iraqis
[2:56:06.940 --> 2:56:10.380]  Uh, and then I said and then I said I didn't say it was really gay frogs
[2:56:10.380 --> 2:56:16.380]  I said there's these estrogen mimicers that are causing asexuality all sorts of confusion in species across the board
[2:56:16.380 --> 2:56:17.900]  I know there's always been gay people forever
[2:56:17.900 --> 2:56:23.420]  And I said that in a larger rant and then they attacked me about gay frogs and then I yelled about the gay frogs
[2:56:23.420 --> 2:56:25.420]  I mean look two weeks ago. They had uh
[2:56:25.980 --> 2:56:33.020]  Colbert cut a clip saying I'm anti-gay. No I said in the clip. I'm not anti-gay. It's not like I'm hiding when I say on here
[2:56:33.180 --> 2:56:36.380]  They're so deceptive now, Dave that it's just reached a new level
[2:56:36.380 --> 2:56:42.300]  That that's a great point also because what's happening now is there's a gajillion people watching this in a certain amount
[2:56:42.300 --> 2:56:46.380]  Just hate right they just hate so all they want to do is wait for the moment
[2:56:46.380 --> 2:56:52.940]  They can selectively edit something I say selectively edit something you say take a question from you and put in a different response
[2:56:52.940 --> 2:56:55.740]  For me and then they get that they spread that around
[2:56:55.980 --> 2:57:00.940]  You know people retweet it they go look how crazy these people are and then we have to spend time cleaning up the mess
[2:57:01.260 --> 2:57:03.260]  And that's mentally exhausting
[2:57:03.260 --> 2:57:08.380]  The good news is people that do that get discredited and people know we're it's like fox news played a clip where I said
[2:57:08.380 --> 2:57:09.900]  Hillary was killing kids in a basement
[2:57:09.900 --> 2:57:14.700]  I said Hillary killed kids by funding radical Islam that sold girls into sex slavery
[2:57:14.940 --> 2:57:20.060]  The clip clearly says it at the front in the back, but they took it out of context and said I said it was happening in a pizza place
[2:57:20.620 --> 2:57:26.300]  But alex, this is why conversation this is why exactly doing what we're doing right now is the most important thing there is
[2:57:26.620 --> 2:57:31.660]  Because most people want to live their life. They don't care how you live their
[2:57:31.660 --> 2:57:35.740]  Their life as long as as long as they live your you live your life
[2:57:35.900 --> 2:57:36.620]  They live their life
[2:57:36.620 --> 2:57:43.180]  It's it really is as simple as that and when we can get to that you find it very easy even right now on my show over the last couple
[2:57:43.180 --> 2:57:45.660]  Weeks, and I hope you'll come on in when next time you're in LA
[2:57:46.060 --> 2:57:50.220]  But you know I found it now easy to build bridges with guys that five years ago
[2:57:50.220 --> 2:57:54.780]  I would have said I could never sit down with you know guys firmly conservative internet though
[2:57:54.780 --> 2:57:59.180]  I think that's what terms left and right are becoming obsolete. Yeah, we're all finding out how much we're like each other
[2:57:59.180 --> 2:58:02.140]  Yes, and how beautiful is that and that's why
[2:58:02.700 --> 2:58:07.180]  Silencing the people on the internet is the scariest thing so you've talked a little bit before about you know
[2:58:07.180 --> 2:58:12.140]  Some of the things that are happening right now. I did an interview about three weeks ago with Fleming Rose
[2:58:12.140 --> 2:58:17.340]  He was the editor of the Danish newspaper that printed the Muhammad cartoons. Yes, you know 10 years or so
[2:58:17.500 --> 2:58:21.580]  This guy is a free speech absolutist. He doesn't have an iota of hate in his body
[2:58:21.660 --> 2:58:26.220]  I spoke with him at UCLA that same evening at a perfectly peaceful event, which was great
[2:58:26.220 --> 2:58:31.340]  Uh youtube demonetized our our video. Oh, yeah, we didn't there was no hate
[2:58:31.500 --> 2:58:35.020]  There was no racism. They were out of time, but come back soon. We come to austin april
[2:58:35.020 --> 2:58:37.580]  Please come see us. I'm gonna come back the fourth hour a great point
[2:58:37.580 --> 2:58:41.740]  Yeah, free speech is under attack folks. So support it. They think they can bully so they can win

[2:59:05.180 --> 2:59:11.180]  What the aging process is is when the cell replicates we lose a little bit of our telomeres
[2:59:11.340 --> 2:59:16.060]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes but when it runs out you start dying
[2:59:16.220 --> 2:59:20.380]  We chose the pqq because it has over 175 different clinical trials

[3:00:37.440 --> 3:00:38.720]  on the island
[3:00:38.720 --> 3:00:40.720]  genre reports coming up in the next segment
[3:00:41.680 --> 3:00:44.720]  What an epic time to be alive ladies and gentlemen. I'm so honored to be here
[3:00:45.360 --> 3:00:48.560]  To be part of this family my great crew all of you the listeners and viewers
[3:00:48.560 --> 3:00:54.320]  I really mean it. This is true community and I want other people regardless what color they are where they're from or
[3:00:54.800 --> 3:00:58.720]  All these things they use to divide us to realize that I believe in humanity and success
[3:00:58.720 --> 3:01:03.280]  And empowering the individual and I believe your success doesn't hurt my success
[3:01:03.600 --> 3:01:06.000]  We have unlimited energy unlimited ideas
[3:01:06.480 --> 3:01:12.480]  Unlimited potential the zero-sum game is the enemy the non zero-sum game is the key
[3:01:13.040 --> 3:01:14.400]  It's king
[3:01:14.400 --> 3:01:17.840]  I'll talk briefly with john outboard after the break and turn the reins over to him
[3:01:18.800 --> 3:01:20.640]  but
[3:01:20.640 --> 3:01:24.720]  We're living in incredible times. We're living when the cia has become a rogue agency
[3:01:24.720 --> 3:01:29.680]  So is most the federal government the state department you name it there are patriots inside of it exposing what's happening
[3:01:29.920 --> 3:01:33.920]  All this information comes out showing these huge crimes that have been committed
[3:01:35.040 --> 3:01:36.960]  Against the american people
[3:01:36.960 --> 3:01:40.080]  And they just turn around and say it's it's it's no big deal
[3:01:40.640 --> 3:01:46.640]  And they turn around and say trump might be in peace for saying obama spied on him. I mean everything's been spied on
[3:01:49.440 --> 3:01:52.800]  It's bravada stacked on top of bravada
[3:01:52.800 --> 3:01:55.760]  And as soon as people see all this hootspa
[3:01:56.800 --> 3:02:00.800]  And and con artists, you know gaming for what it is. It's game over
[3:02:02.240 --> 3:02:05.680]  And that's why they want to dumb the culture down because only the stupidest
[3:02:06.480 --> 3:02:10.000]  Most naive dim-witted person would buy this
[3:02:10.720 --> 3:02:14.560]  It's amazing. I mean a month ago. They said they were tapping and tracking everything
[3:02:15.040 --> 3:02:18.560]  Trump tower was doing and had been watching them. Then they said, oh, we never did that. What do you mean?
[3:02:18.560 --> 3:02:20.560]  It's crazy. We're spying on you
[3:02:20.560 --> 3:02:27.600]  It doesn't work and now the so-called left is running around is the handmaiden of radical islam
[3:02:28.160 --> 3:02:30.800]  And they're teaching it everywhere. It's like wow
[3:02:32.080 --> 3:02:34.880]  What freakazoid planet did I wake up on?
[3:02:36.000 --> 3:02:39.040]  And I was all against going and bombing the middle east and stirring up that area
[3:02:39.040 --> 3:02:44.320]  I don't want to hurt those people because I knew they were being set up to bring down the borders and flood us with it
[3:02:45.840 --> 3:02:48.880]  You know that the globalists just want to have them starving to death in a squalor, do you?
[3:02:48.880 --> 3:02:51.120]  They want you under their control as well
[3:02:52.720 --> 3:02:54.720]  Now I've not done the best job
[3:02:54.720 --> 3:02:59.040]  Plugging here today just because I get so obsessed with the news and the info. I did such a passion
[3:02:59.040 --> 3:02:59.840]  I tend to not do it
[3:02:59.840 --> 3:03:03.680]  But I'm glad that a tiny fraction of you actually believe me on things
[3:03:04.240 --> 3:03:07.360]  Like the products because of one of that tiny fraction. We would be reaching
[3:03:08.080 --> 3:03:10.800]  50 million 45 million people a week conservatively
[3:03:12.640 --> 3:03:16.480]  But I do love that fraction of folks that by the trump penns 2020 shirts
[3:03:16.480 --> 3:03:22.000]  Just to stand up for free spaces spread the word support the broadcast free shipping until next week 995 for those shirts
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:28.640]  You can't beat it. We've got the new anti fungus formula that flushes it out of the guts the fungus in the mold
[3:03:29.280 --> 3:03:32.080]  Myco zx the very best healthy system way to do that
[3:03:32.720 --> 3:03:38.240]  Uh, I've never seen a product sell like this. Our audience is really informed about it's not just bacteria. It's the molds the yeast
[3:03:39.360 --> 3:03:45.520]  It's out of control. You can get it 10 off with a probiotic biome defense 50 billion live and active cultures over 25 billion
[3:03:45.520 --> 3:03:47.520]  Uh, that's that's the extra strength 50 billion
[3:03:47.680 --> 3:03:53.600]  You get those together at info wars store.com reinforce live.com or cultural free triple a two five three three one three nine
[3:03:53.600 --> 3:03:56.960]  I gotta tell you sometimes order a big giant amount of something and we can't sell it
[3:03:56.960 --> 3:04:00.880]  Even though it's a great product and it sometimes orders a bunch of something and we spend all the money
[3:04:00.880 --> 3:04:03.040]  We got to order a big ship and it just sells out. You're like
[3:04:03.920 --> 3:04:08.560]  Well, then that that's a good problem to have yeah, except you never know what everybody's gonna buy what they're not gonna buy
[3:04:08.560 --> 3:04:09.840]  It's crazy
[3:04:09.840 --> 3:04:12.320]  And so it'll probably take us. I don't know months
[3:04:12.320 --> 3:04:17.440]  They're saying to get more of this because everything's tested to california standards that are almost impossible to be at
[3:04:17.680 --> 3:04:20.560]  I was calling group. Yeah, I said, let's take some of the stuff out of dna force
[3:04:20.960 --> 3:04:24.240]  Because it'll be sold out for six months trying to test it and test it and test it
[3:04:24.400 --> 3:04:27.200]  The air has more lead and and arsenic in it
[3:04:27.600 --> 3:04:34.000]  Then then what you can have in herbs and in compounds, but nevertheless almost all our products are california standard
[3:04:34.560 --> 3:04:40.240]  When they're not we end up just pulling an ingredient out. So, uh, it's it's we've got myco zx right now
[3:04:40.240 --> 3:04:46.480]  And boy if I don't order 10 times of this, we'd be funding ourselves nicely, but we're not it's gonna sell out
[3:04:46.560 --> 3:04:49.280]  Probably by saturday or sunday. I'm gonna keep it discounted
[3:04:50.640 --> 3:04:52.720]  I should be smart and actually up the price, but I'm not gonna do that
[3:04:52.720 --> 3:04:55.760]  I want you to see how great it is and keep buying it and help support the broadcast in the future
[3:04:55.920 --> 3:04:58.880]  I treat you like I want to be treated but get it today. It's about to sell out
[3:04:59.920 --> 3:05:06.720]  Katie Perry is now in a real estate dispute with nuns over an iconic multi-million dollar convent los feliz in los angeles
[3:05:06.720 --> 3:05:12.800]  The stunning property was built in 1927 and Perry has offered over 14 million dollars for the property problem is
[3:05:13.040 --> 3:05:16.880]  Sister Rita Callahan and sister Catherine Holtzman claim the property is theirs to sell
[3:05:16.960 --> 3:05:21.120]  Having been the occupants there and part of the order of the immaculate heart of the blessed virgin mary
[3:05:21.200 --> 3:05:25.360]  And they won't sell it to Perry because they don't like her lifestyle a kind way of saying
[3:05:25.680 --> 3:05:27.200]  She's a satanic witch
[3:05:27.200 --> 3:05:32.640]  But the greedy archdiocese of la claims it is theirs to sell and they want to sell it to Perry for the exorbitant price
[3:05:32.640 --> 3:05:37.920]  Perry tried to play coy with the sisters saying she has a jesus tattoo, but they called her out on her other tattoos
[3:05:38.000 --> 3:05:42.160]  Her performances and her attendance at a salem witch walk, which conveniently she couldn't recall
[3:05:42.320 --> 3:05:46.080]  They also brought up this statement from Perry. I want it to be like the amy grand of music
[3:05:47.040 --> 3:05:50.560]  But it didn't work out and so I sold my soul to the devil
[3:05:50.800 --> 3:05:53.920]  This case has now reached the highest legal authorities in the catholic church
[3:05:54.160 --> 3:05:58.800]  Guess we will see where their loyalties lie for info wars.com. This is Owen shroyer
[3:05:58.800 --> 3:06:04.960]  Do you ever wonder what happened to america? They lost we won
[3:06:05.520 --> 3:06:07.520]  Want to see what trumps up against?
[3:06:08.080 --> 3:06:14.800]  Revelation the movie dot info because of what we did on this state change has come to america
[3:06:15.520 --> 3:06:20.800]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces bent on global governance
[3:06:21.200 --> 3:06:27.040]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag heritage mom and apple pie
[3:06:27.040 --> 3:06:32.880]  Gobson school morality had a future and beef was for supper
[3:06:33.920 --> 3:06:40.000]  Revelation dawn of global government where the solution americans ain't nothing more to it than that

[3:08:29.440 --> 3:08:32.160]  We live in incredible times
[3:08:32.160 --> 3:08:40.880]  Legend passes before us daily and many don't even see the fact that they're in the middle of complete and total wonderment
[3:08:41.920 --> 3:08:47.760]  Not just here on this planet, but all around us as we hurdle through the time space continuum
[3:08:49.040 --> 3:08:51.760]  Global government is in great crisis openly exposed
[3:08:52.000 --> 3:08:55.760]  Stephen Hawking the physicist says planetary regime is needed to save us
[3:08:55.760 --> 3:09:05.440]  The planetary government is already here and it's the seeds of destruction because it's waging a war against humanity as if it's not of this world
[3:09:06.480 --> 3:09:09.920]  Great secrets have still yet to be unlocked
[3:09:11.200 --> 3:09:12.240]  But think about it
[3:09:12.240 --> 3:09:17.120]  He told you 18 years ago about the cameras and microphones listening to you with key word software now
[3:09:17.120 --> 3:09:18.720]  It's all out in the open
[3:09:18.720 --> 3:09:26.960]  We told you about the cancer viruses added to the vaccines. It's out in the open and more and more it all comes out all being thrown your face
[3:09:27.440 --> 3:09:29.280]  And the pope comes out
[3:09:29.280 --> 3:09:34.720]  Who he calls christianity, you know disgusting the roots of it in europe and open the border to islam
[3:09:36.000 --> 3:09:39.120]  He says that populism is evil. That's a quote
[3:09:40.080 --> 3:09:46.080]  That's the one in telegraph today populism is evil the people what's populism the rule of the people the people
[3:09:46.080 --> 3:09:52.800]  Hope frances issues veiled warning about donald rump populism is evil. No, he said the people are evil
[3:09:56.000 --> 3:10:03.040]  And he's the greatest hypocrite behind multi hundred foot tall walls saying take refugees who are military age men
[3:10:04.640 --> 3:10:07.840]  So across the planet people from brazil
[3:10:09.440 --> 3:10:11.440]  to japan
[3:10:11.440 --> 3:10:12.800]  to russia
[3:10:12.800 --> 3:10:14.240]  to europe
[3:10:14.240 --> 3:10:16.960]  england to island to the united states
[3:10:17.520 --> 3:10:19.520]  everywhere
[3:10:19.920 --> 3:10:27.360]  Even the sniveling cute boy of socialism trudeau has to be nice to trump now because he knows the real numbers are trump's super successful super popular
[3:10:28.720 --> 3:10:30.720]  trumps made a lot of really good moves to dev
[3:10:32.000 --> 3:10:36.800]  Evolve the power from the elite to the people to cut taxes to get rid of regulations. This is new paul ryan thing
[3:10:36.800 --> 3:10:41.280]  I it's better. No bottom care, but it's still bad. I want to repeal completely. That's I think trumps first big problem
[3:10:41.520 --> 3:10:43.520]  I said it was a problem. He said
[3:10:43.520 --> 3:10:46.960]  The attorney general refused himself turns out he wasn't behind that totally made up
[3:10:47.360 --> 3:10:51.760]  So we've reached a moment now that I don't know what you call it in history, but
[3:10:53.280 --> 3:10:58.080]  North korea suddenly threatening to attack seol launching missiles at over the coast of japan
[3:10:58.640 --> 3:11:00.960]  trumps had to move b52s and with nukes
[3:11:03.920 --> 3:11:04.880]  Good things are happening
[3:11:04.880 --> 3:11:09.520]  But remember the globalists created world war one and world war two in their own admissions to bring in a league of nations in the
[3:11:09.520 --> 3:11:10.000]  un
[3:11:10.000 --> 3:11:14.400]  So I don't think we should celebrate too much. We should be glad we've come this far
[3:11:15.360 --> 3:11:18.000]  But the dark forces the twisted forces
[3:11:18.720 --> 3:11:20.720]  hell bent on
[3:11:20.960 --> 3:11:26.320]  Sucking off humanity and in keeping us in in in basically mass mental illness aren't going to give up easily
[3:11:26.320 --> 3:11:30.480]  So my good buddy and a great talk show host going to take over the balance of the hour
[3:11:30.800 --> 3:11:34.560]  John Rappaport no more fake news.com. He said that you are all at 16 years
[3:11:35.840 --> 3:11:39.040]  CNN's dropping the term fake news because it got thrown back on them so much
[3:11:39.040 --> 3:11:43.680]  We're calling it unverified now and banning us when we have a senator on
[3:11:44.000 --> 3:11:46.480]  Oh, you have the senator on rand paul about his bill
[3:11:47.120 --> 3:11:53.120]  Facebook we're going to delete that not because it wasn't credible because it was credible. So the great battle is now
[3:11:54.160 --> 3:11:59.360]  It's intensifying and people need to know we're seeing more censorship the last two weeks. We've seen the last five years
[3:11:59.360 --> 3:12:00.400]  So
[3:12:00.400 --> 3:12:06.320]  Don't take the broadcast for granted. Don't take your own speech for granted. Use it now be involved
[3:12:06.320 --> 3:12:11.760]  John, I want you to take over always enjoy listening and watching while I work around the office and at night
[3:12:11.840 --> 3:12:15.120]  During the rebroadcast, but you've heard me set the table for this
[3:12:16.400 --> 3:12:19.520]  More is happening now in a month that happened in a year now that we're entering
[3:12:20.560 --> 3:12:26.880]  Uh, a major time of of turning of change and because of technology, obviously it's it's accelerated
[3:12:27.200 --> 3:12:33.280]  Greater than any change you've ever seen. I the energy, uh, just just intellectually the energy. I feel is
[3:12:33.280 --> 3:12:41.280]  Tectonic it's good. It's bad. It's it's it's twisted. It's it's explosive. I think we are in an explosion right now
[3:12:42.400 --> 3:12:46.880]  And I don't think we realize exactly how big it is or what it is because we're in the explosion
[3:12:48.320 --> 3:12:50.880]  Agreed and the people who are
[3:12:52.080 --> 3:12:54.080]  Promoting the dark side
[3:12:54.960 --> 3:12:56.960]  They feel incredibly threatened
[3:12:57.600 --> 3:12:58.640]  You know
[3:12:58.640 --> 3:13:04.800]  And it's been accelerating over the last two years. It's like, uh, you know, the genie popped out of the bottle
[3:13:05.840 --> 3:13:09.920]  As long as the election looked like it was going to be a snoozer
[3:13:11.040 --> 3:13:13.040]  Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton
[3:13:13.200 --> 3:13:16.080]  Media were complacent everything is going along
[3:13:16.480 --> 3:13:20.480]  Which means the globalist agenda of destruction is proceeding and all of a sudden
[3:13:21.040 --> 3:13:23.600]  This cowboy appears out of nowhere and says well
[3:13:23.600 --> 3:13:28.400]  Well, the first thing is we don't want globalism people go. What is that?
[3:13:29.600 --> 3:13:34.080]  That's meaning you lose your job. It goes out of the country. We're going to bring all that back
[3:13:34.640 --> 3:13:35.440]  What?
[3:13:35.440 --> 3:13:40.160]  Yeah, because you see all these corporations have been led to go out of the country and then they ship the goods back here
[3:13:40.160 --> 3:13:44.400]  And they don't and all we need to each other and other nations each other. We can still trade but it's about us again
[3:13:44.400 --> 3:13:46.960]  I mean, you know, look at Jamie diamond. This is key
[3:13:46.960 --> 3:13:53.040]  I did diamond says trump has reawakened animal spirit in us. Maybe no way to stop the recovery
[3:13:53.040 --> 3:13:59.520]  They're trying to block it. But but notice he calls it animal. He means human populism. They think humans evil
[3:13:59.600 --> 3:14:03.760]  They act like damn aliens. I'm not saying they are but in their own language
[3:14:04.320 --> 3:14:08.320]  We're animals. We've got to be dominant. Yeah, but it's it's true. I am an animal
[3:14:08.320 --> 3:14:12.720]  I am a human made the image of god, but I guess I'm still a biological creature. I want to be free
[3:14:12.720 --> 3:14:17.600]  I want success damn right Jamie diamond. It's an animal spirit. It's a caveman spirit
[3:14:17.760 --> 3:14:22.480]  And that's not primitive what you've made us is a slug like I'm ranting
[3:14:22.480 --> 3:14:25.200]  But let's let's talk about that and then I'm going to let you take over
[3:14:26.080 --> 3:14:27.120]  sure
[3:14:27.120 --> 3:14:32.960]  Because these people, you know from their elevated high platforms look down on everybody else and they say well
[3:14:33.520 --> 3:14:36.000]  These are the animals that are out of control
[3:14:36.640 --> 3:14:39.440]  We are the leaders and so we have to reprogram them
[3:14:39.440 --> 3:14:43.440]  Uh to suit us so that they become obedient complacent
[3:14:44.080 --> 3:14:48.320]  Along with the agenda, right and that's what they're about. That's their whole idea
[3:14:48.800 --> 3:14:54.240]  We're going to reprogram the planet and we'll lead us into the uh, that's right. The plants aren't right
[3:14:54.560 --> 3:14:57.360]  We're going to we're going to control the atmosphere control the plants and animals
[3:14:57.440 --> 3:15:02.560]  We're going to reengineer everything because you know this sucks. We need to make it a lot better like north korea did
[3:15:03.280 --> 3:15:08.960]  Exactly. That's their plan. That's their idea. And so people say well, that's not going to happen
[3:15:08.960 --> 3:15:10.400]  We don't want that
[3:15:10.400 --> 3:15:13.600]  So that suddenly makes us what a populist
[3:15:14.320 --> 3:15:20.080]  Yeah, I would like to survive if you don't mind like to be free. In fact, I'm going to be free no matter what you do
[3:15:20.880 --> 3:15:25.040]  And there are millions of people like me all over the world more than millions
[3:15:25.520 --> 3:15:28.560]  If you want to call that populism fine, we call it freedom
[3:15:29.360 --> 3:15:35.680]  So you better watch out. So the pope's really saying freedom is evil. Yeah, that's right. He's saying freedom is evil
[3:15:35.680 --> 3:15:41.120]  Control is good. Top-down control is good. Ignorance is good
[3:15:41.680 --> 3:15:47.120]  You want to know the way to uh enlightenment? You follow what we tell you to follow
[3:15:47.680 --> 3:15:52.880]  Here are the rules. Here's what you have to memorize. You can only go through us to get above
[3:15:53.200 --> 3:15:57.360]  I mean, that's the whole theory of this kind of uh, you know religious
[3:15:57.840 --> 3:16:01.600]  Insanity you got to go through the priest to find god got to go through the priest
[3:16:01.600 --> 3:16:05.520]  Wow, where did that come from? Christ said the opposite. He said you don't
[3:16:06.640 --> 3:16:14.000]  Yeah, he said all kinds of things that were completely but supposedly at the same time he said here
[3:16:14.560 --> 3:16:18.880]  You guys you're going to build my church for me. Oh, we'll be happy to do that
[3:16:18.880 --> 3:16:22.080]  But of course we're going to make it into a giant control mechanism
[3:16:22.480 --> 3:16:25.520]  That's going to suck in as much of the plan as we possibly can
[3:16:25.520 --> 3:16:33.040]  So for them populism is completely evil because it means people are standing up for themselves and saying well, we don't need you
[3:16:33.200 --> 3:16:38.320]  Thank you very much. That's fine. If we want god, we can find our own individual way there
[3:16:38.640 --> 3:16:42.800]  We don't need to go through all this. Uh, you know maze that you set up for us
[3:16:44.080 --> 3:16:46.080]  A maze full of pedophiles
[3:16:46.320 --> 3:16:50.320]  Yeah, that's right a maze full of pedophiles on top of that right exactly
[3:16:50.400 --> 3:16:53.440]  This is not a fun maze to be in take over at the port. You're awesome

[3:18:24.240 --> 3:18:26.880]  Atrazine, that's the name of the pesticide
[3:18:27.600 --> 3:18:30.640]  That was discovered in many animal studies to cause

[3:18:50.320 --> 3:18:53.680]  You know, there's a word I say and then all of a sudden the article appears

[3:18:58.720 --> 3:19:00.240]  But of course

[3:23:57.600 --> 3:24:05.440]  John rap support back here at info wars in the fourth hour
[3:24:06.960 --> 3:24:09.680]  I've got some things to say about obama care
[3:24:10.480 --> 3:24:14.240]  Obamacare light obamacare heavy obamacare. No, yes
[3:24:15.200 --> 3:24:17.200]  You know look
[3:24:17.600 --> 3:24:24.080]  We're doing a lot here. We're doing a lot here. We're doing a lot here. We're doing a lot here
[3:24:24.080 --> 3:24:34.360]  So yes, you know, look, any compulsory national health insurance plan where you've got to
[3:24:34.360 --> 3:24:42.880]  be in it, you can't get out of it or you pay a penalty, you know, that's taking your freedom
[3:24:42.880 --> 3:24:43.880]  away.
[3:24:43.880 --> 3:24:49.520]  I don't care how it's structured or who's in charge or what they call it or who voted
[3:24:49.520 --> 3:24:57.680]  for it or whatever, because implicit in all these plans, especially in Obamacare, is that
[3:24:57.680 --> 3:25:03.400]  more and more over time the government decides what good healthcare is, what you get, in
[3:25:03.400 --> 3:25:08.040]  other words, from the doctor and what you can't get.
[3:25:08.040 --> 3:25:14.360]  Now we're getting down to the basics, the nub of the situation.
[3:25:14.360 --> 3:25:21.600]  Over time, the government decides, here's a giant list of all the possible diseases
[3:25:21.600 --> 3:25:27.880]  and disorders, and here are the permitted treatments for all those diseases and disorders,
[3:25:27.880 --> 3:25:34.160]  you see, and the list grows and grows and what they throw out grows and grows.
[3:25:34.160 --> 3:25:40.800]  And all these natural health practitioners who think that they're going to get a good
[3:25:40.800 --> 3:25:47.960]  deal out of this plan because they can attach themselves in some way to the Obamacare version
[3:25:47.960 --> 3:25:53.400]  that's going to eventually come out, are fooling themselves.
[3:25:53.400 --> 3:25:57.040]  Now many natural health practitioners already see the handwriting on the wall, but there
[3:25:57.040 --> 3:26:00.080]  are others who think, wow, this is a good deal.
[3:26:00.080 --> 3:26:08.280]  This makes us almost like real doctors, you know, come on, wake up, wake up.
[3:26:08.280 --> 3:26:16.280]  This is about enforced medical care, this is about the medical cartel, this is about
[3:26:16.280 --> 3:26:23.680]  the medical police state, and as an investigative reporter for the last 34 years, gee, it just
[3:26:23.680 --> 3:26:32.280]  so happens I know a very great deal about this medical cartel, a very great deal.
[3:26:32.280 --> 3:26:38.560]  So I've been wanting people all along since the first glimmers of Obamacare occurred
[3:26:38.560 --> 3:26:46.520]  all those years ago, watch out, because you're going to enter into a medical prison where
[3:26:46.520 --> 3:26:54.040]  more and more you're limited in what you can get and what you can't get, what you can choose,
[3:26:54.040 --> 3:27:02.440]  what happens to your freedom, and as it turns out, of course, medical treatment certainly
[3:27:02.440 --> 3:27:10.120]  in the U.S. and all around the world is getting more and more toxic, toxic.
[3:27:10.120 --> 3:27:17.040]  I've cited this review, I don't know, 5,000 times now, but I never tire of it.
[3:27:17.040 --> 3:27:24.480]  July 26, 2000, Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Barbara Starfield, Johns Hopkins
[3:27:24.480 --> 3:27:34.680]  School of Public Health, all mainstream, all, not only mainstream, but insider mainstream.
[3:27:34.680 --> 3:27:37.880]  Is U.S. health really the best in the world?
[3:27:37.880 --> 3:27:40.000]  That was a title of her review.
[3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:45.360]  I interviewed her in 2009, we went deeper into this, but her conclusion was, and it's
[3:27:45.360 --> 3:27:51.120]  backed up by other citations that I have quoted at No More Fake News.
[3:27:51.120 --> 3:27:56.360]  Every year in the U.S., medical system kills 225,000 people.
[3:27:56.360 --> 3:28:05.720]  Okay, that's a conservative estimate, 225,000 people killed, we're not even talking yet
[3:28:05.720 --> 3:28:08.400]  about maimed, but killed.
[3:28:08.400 --> 3:28:15.760]  That would be 2.25 million killings per decade.
[3:28:15.760 --> 3:28:21.960]  That's one of the things you get when you get a compulsory national health insurance
[3:28:21.960 --> 3:28:28.560]  plan called Obamacare or call it whatever else you want, OrionCare, I don't care.
[3:28:28.560 --> 3:28:31.480]  That's one of the things you get.
[3:28:31.480 --> 3:28:33.640]  That's part of the secret.
[3:28:33.640 --> 3:28:42.560]  That's part of the secret deal, the secret plan, the secret Rockefeller globalist plan.
[3:28:42.560 --> 3:28:47.680]  Because, look, people say, oh, that's a big conspiracy, you mean they want to kill all
[3:28:47.680 --> 3:28:48.680]  these people?
[3:28:48.680 --> 3:28:54.400]  Well, A, if you know it's happening and you've known about it for a long time and you don't
[3:28:54.400 --> 3:29:00.240]  do anything about it whatsoever and you never try to fix it, and in fact, your brand of
[3:29:00.240 --> 3:29:06.680]  medicine, pharmaceutical medicine, is killing roughly half that number of the people that
[3:29:06.680 --> 3:29:14.760]  I just quoted on an ongoing basis, wouldn't you say that's sufficient for suspicion that
[3:29:14.760 --> 3:29:22.560]  you, the globalist elite, A, know about this and two, want it to happen?
[3:29:22.560 --> 3:29:26.520]  Come on, come on.
[3:29:26.520 --> 3:29:30.000]  That's just the beginning of what I'm going to talk about here.
[3:29:30.000 --> 3:29:57.120]  What medical war against the people, John Rappaport, 4th hour, infowars, we will be back.
[3:30:00.320 --> 3:30:04.000]  You've heard of Doomsday bunkers, you've heard of secret Doomsday airstrips, we've
[3:30:04.000 --> 3:30:08.080]  now even heard of entire villages designed for survival in a Doomsday scenario.
[3:30:08.080 --> 3:30:09.600]  See Trident Lakes in Texas.
[3:30:09.600 --> 3:30:13.840]  But now the latest, Plan B Marine in New York City is an emergency escape club where the
[3:30:13.840 --> 3:30:17.440]  elites of New York can join who don't have the time to come up with their own emergency
[3:30:17.440 --> 3:30:18.440]  escape plans.
[3:30:18.440 --> 3:30:22.920]  For an annual fee of $90,000, you have access to a GPS traceable boat, which is a military
[3:30:22.920 --> 3:30:27.280]  style Coast Guard boat meant to brave harsh conditions and designed for deep ocean survival,
[3:30:27.280 --> 3:30:29.320]  which you can also abandon at any time.
[3:30:29.320 --> 3:30:33.120]  Plan B Marine will also plan your escape for you, catering to each client based on their
[3:30:33.120 --> 3:30:34.400]  needs and location.
[3:30:34.400 --> 3:30:38.600]  So this is just yet another story of the elites preparing for the worst, as well as a growing
[3:30:38.600 --> 3:30:40.880]  market for emergency supplies and shelters.
[3:30:40.880 --> 3:30:44.400]  With the crazy elites in power, it's always been smart to have emergency plans.
[3:30:44.400 --> 3:30:47.960]  But now that their new world order is falling apart, perhaps the preparedness market will
[3:30:47.960 --> 3:30:53.240]  continue to expand in fear the new world order will devastatingly act out in a violent act
[3:30:53.240 --> 3:30:54.520]  of desperation.
[3:30:54.520 --> 3:30:59.920]  This is Owen Troyer, and if you're concerned, we can help at infowarstore.com.
[3:30:59.920 --> 3:31:01.760]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[3:31:01.760 --> 3:31:03.800]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[3:31:03.800 --> 3:31:06.680]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[3:31:06.680 --> 3:31:12.720]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[3:31:12.720 --> 3:31:17.640]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking
[3:31:17.640 --> 3:31:22.600]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze, whether it's your home
[3:31:22.600 --> 3:31:27.760]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[3:31:27.760 --> 3:31:29.480]  you can to purify your air.
[3:31:29.480 --> 3:31:34.480]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[3:31:34.480 --> 3:31:37.480]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[3:31:37.480 --> 3:31:39.680]  The general public doesn't.
[3:31:39.680 --> 3:31:43.640]  The Alexa pure breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[3:31:43.640 --> 3:31:47.240]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[3:31:47.240 --> 3:31:50.800]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[3:31:50.800 --> 3:31:54.040]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[3:31:54.040 --> 3:32:00.800]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then forwarstore.com.
[3:32:00.800 --> 3:32:02.120]  This is Alex Jones.
[3:32:02.120 --> 3:32:06.480]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off the grid
[3:32:06.480 --> 3:32:07.480]  products of 2017.
[3:32:07.480 --> 3:32:10.600]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[3:32:10.600 --> 3:32:14.280]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from
[3:32:14.280 --> 3:32:16.520]  Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[3:32:16.520 --> 3:32:20.960]  The PPX is so small, you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful, you can run some
[3:32:20.960 --> 3:32:25.520]  110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling.
[3:32:25.520 --> 3:32:29.960]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment,
[3:32:29.960 --> 3:32:30.960]  even airplanes.
[3:32:30.960 --> 3:32:34.840]  The system provides an endless supply of off the grid electricity, allowing you to create
[3:32:34.840 --> 3:32:38.200]  your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[3:32:38.200 --> 3:32:43.040]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, any time you need to get off the grid for a while.
[3:32:43.040 --> 3:32:46.400]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[3:32:46.400 --> 3:32:48.520]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[3:32:48.520 --> 3:32:54.280]  Even better, use coupon code private at checkout and get a second PPX Energy Unit for free.
[3:32:54.280 --> 3:32:56.600]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[3:32:56.600 --> 3:33:26.520]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[3:33:26.520 --> 3:33:52.920]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[3:33:52.920 --> 3:34:03.000]  Compulsory and they want you in the system, and the system has big time dangers.
[3:34:03.000 --> 3:34:07.920]  I gave you the stat, the Starfield stat in the last segment.
[3:34:07.920 --> 3:34:14.840]  Medical system in the US kills 225,000 people a year, conservative estimate, or 2.25 million
[3:34:14.840 --> 3:34:18.880]  people per decade, also conservative estimate.
[3:34:18.880 --> 3:34:19.880]  That's not from me.
[3:34:19.880 --> 3:34:25.480]  That's from the Journal of the American Medical Association July 26, 2000.
[3:34:25.480 --> 3:34:33.320]  I want to get into something more, if you want to call it even more chilling than that,
[3:34:33.320 --> 3:34:35.320]  the next generation of vaccines.
[3:34:35.320 --> 3:34:38.960]  Now, what does that have to do with Obamacare?
[3:34:38.960 --> 3:34:47.760]  Well, if you're in the system, it's this way, the funnel gets narrow and narrow as
[3:34:47.760 --> 3:34:48.760]  you move.
[3:34:48.760 --> 3:34:53.040]  Well, last year we said it didn't matter whether you did this or that, but now if you're part
[3:34:53.040 --> 3:34:58.800]  of the system, really, we want you to do this, and then later that becomes, well, if you
[3:34:58.800 --> 3:35:04.120]  don't do it, we kick you out of the system, but then we find you, and then later on it
[3:35:04.120 --> 3:35:08.000]  becomes, you can't get out of the system.
[3:35:08.000 --> 3:35:10.840]  The system is everywhere.
[3:35:10.840 --> 3:35:15.240]  That's called the evolution of destructive systems.
[3:35:15.240 --> 3:35:18.720]  That's the way it works.
[3:35:18.720 --> 3:35:24.440]  First generation of vaccines will be included as part of this system, and it will follow
[3:35:24.440 --> 3:35:26.160]  that evolution.
[3:35:26.160 --> 3:35:27.880]  They're called DNA vaccines.
[3:35:27.880 --> 3:35:35.240]  The article appeared 2015, I'm going to say April New York Times.
[3:35:35.240 --> 3:35:39.000]  I wrote a couple pieces about this.
[3:35:39.000 --> 3:35:43.400]  Screw in your brains real tight on this because you want to understand this.
[3:35:43.400 --> 3:35:48.480]  What the genetic researchers are saying is, look.
[3:35:48.480 --> 3:35:55.440]  Human clinical trials are already underway, tests, that's 2015.
[3:35:55.440 --> 3:36:05.560]  We synthesize a gene that we say can produce immunity to a specific disease, here it is.
[3:36:05.560 --> 3:36:16.480]  We load that gene onto a virus, we inject the virus into the body, the gene drops off
[3:36:16.480 --> 3:36:27.080]  and is incorporated into your DNA, thus immunizing you against the disease, just like we said.
[3:36:27.080 --> 3:36:37.960]  Of course, it permanently alters your DNA, got it?
[3:36:37.960 --> 3:36:43.920]  In the Times article, they interviewed Nobel Prize winner, Dr. David Baltimore, and he
[3:36:43.920 --> 3:36:50.040]  said, well, yes, very interesting, he said, of course, I could see how people, some people
[3:36:50.040 --> 3:36:56.920]  might be a little leery about having their DNA changed, really, you think so.
[3:36:56.920 --> 3:37:02.360]  On top of that, no guarantee of immunity, but let's put that aside because what we're
[3:37:02.360 --> 3:37:10.720]  talking about is re-engineering your DNA and everybody's DNA who receives the next generation
[3:37:10.720 --> 3:37:12.240]  of vaccines.
[3:37:12.240 --> 3:37:20.720]  Not only now on the drawing boards, but in clinical trials of humans.
[3:37:20.720 --> 3:37:27.160]  And then, doesn't it follow as the night today that if your DNA is permanently altered, the
[3:37:27.160 --> 3:37:36.080]  next generation's DNA, when you become mommy, daddy, that will also be altered because that's
[3:37:36.080 --> 3:37:41.920]  what you're handing down and so on and so forth, thus re-engineering the entire human
[3:37:41.920 --> 3:37:42.920]  race.
[3:37:42.920 --> 3:37:48.880]  Much more to the story, I will continue that, but let's talk about a natural product at
[3:37:48.880 --> 3:37:59.280]  InfowarsStore.com, InfowarsLife.com, the all-new MycoZX fungus and yeast cleanser.
[3:37:59.280 --> 3:38:02.240]  So we're talking about candida.
[3:38:02.240 --> 3:38:05.400]  We're talking about fungal problems.
[3:38:05.400 --> 3:38:11.200]  Candida alone releases over 80 known toxins which can weaken the body's defenses and cause
[3:38:11.200 --> 3:38:15.720]  the mucous membranes of the gut to start leaking.
[3:38:15.720 --> 3:38:22.520]  Yeast overgrowth is even linked to an average weight gain of 32.5 pounds.
[3:38:22.520 --> 3:38:30.240]  MycoZX is an all-natural fungus and yeast cleanser by InfowarsLife that uses organic herbs and
[3:38:30.240 --> 3:38:34.920]  enzymes to activate your body's own defenses.
[3:38:34.920 --> 3:38:40.840]  Seven of the most powerful organic and wild-crafted ingredients designed to attack and melt away
[3:38:40.840 --> 3:38:45.200]  the membrane of yeast and fungal organisms.
[3:38:45.200 --> 3:38:53.160]  Fight back against hidden yeast and fungus with MycoZX at InfowarsLife.com and get free
[3:38:53.160 --> 3:38:56.520]  ship this week alone.
[3:38:56.520 --> 3:39:05.560]  Limited special here is 10% off when you get MycoZX with a powerful biome defense probiotic
[3:39:05.560 --> 3:39:12.480]  on InfowarsLife.com.
[3:39:12.480 --> 3:39:16.560]  There it is.
[3:39:16.560 --> 3:39:24.080]  Genetically engineered so-called vaccines that alter your DNA and everybody else's DNA.
[3:39:24.080 --> 3:39:26.960]  Of course, they're not vaccines.
[3:39:26.960 --> 3:39:31.280]  It's genetic intrusion, invasion.
[3:39:31.280 --> 3:39:41.280]  And like I say, once you impose a compulsory national health insurance plan on a country,
[3:39:41.280 --> 3:39:43.680]  you are now setting the stage.
[3:39:43.680 --> 3:39:45.960]  You're setting the table.
[3:39:45.960 --> 3:39:47.240]  This is the op.
[3:39:47.240 --> 3:39:48.840]  This is the covert op.
[3:39:48.840 --> 3:39:53.880]  Once we've got them in the system, we can do whatever we want with them in terms of the
[3:39:53.880 --> 3:39:57.520]  actual medical treatment that we're giving them.
[3:39:57.520 --> 3:40:00.480]  Hey, you're part of the system.
[3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:05.400]  You're getting a great deal here.
[3:40:05.400 --> 3:40:07.080]  Hold up your arm.
[3:40:07.080 --> 3:40:08.360]  Roll up your sleeve.
[3:40:08.360 --> 3:40:10.280]  Here we go with the injection.
[3:40:10.280 --> 3:40:13.840]  This has got a gene in it that's going to immunize you against the disease.
[3:40:13.840 --> 3:40:16.080]  Oh, really, Dr. Yes, absolutely.
[3:40:16.080 --> 3:40:20.320]  Of course, it will permanently alter your DNA.
[3:40:20.320 --> 3:40:21.320]  But that's all right.
[3:40:21.320 --> 3:40:24.680]  Don't worry about that.
[3:40:24.680 --> 3:40:27.680]  Unbelievable.
[3:40:27.680 --> 3:40:30.840]  Here are the page one headlines.
[3:40:30.840 --> 3:40:36.680]  How does that not lead the nightly news and lead to all kinds of investigative journalism?
[3:40:36.680 --> 3:40:44.200]  Let's let the hounds loose at the major networks and the major newspapers and find out why these
[3:40:44.200 --> 3:40:48.320]  people think that they can reprogram the human race.
[3:40:48.320 --> 3:40:52.440]  No, none of that is happening.
[3:40:52.440 --> 3:40:53.520]  That's not their job.
[3:40:53.520 --> 3:40:56.280]  They're in cahoots with these people.
[3:40:56.280 --> 3:41:00.200]  They're inside the medical cartel themselves.
[3:41:00.200 --> 3:41:03.880]  This is what I've documented for over 30 years now.
[3:41:03.880 --> 3:41:11.320]  You can't really talk about mainstream medical reporters and mainstream news and the medical
[3:41:11.320 --> 3:41:14.440]  cartel as being separate entities.
[3:41:14.440 --> 3:41:19.000]  The marriage was consummated a long time ago.
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:21.880]  A long time ago.
[3:41:21.880 --> 3:41:29.840]  It's up to us, and it's up to independent media to start blowing the whistle on things
[3:41:29.840 --> 3:41:31.960]  like this.
[3:41:31.960 --> 3:41:39.280]  And this is a heavy one, folks, a really heavy one, because what are we talking about here?
[3:41:39.280 --> 3:41:46.960]  You open this door with so-called DNA vaccines, you're now talking about unlimited genetic
[3:41:46.960 --> 3:41:55.280]  experiments, covert, with surveillance tracking of the recipients, don't know they're the
[3:41:55.280 --> 3:42:00.800]  recipients, to see what the responses are going to be over time, part of the reason
[3:42:00.800 --> 3:42:03.400]  for the surveillance state to face it.
[3:42:03.400 --> 3:42:10.360]  All right, so we think we've got a gene synthesized here that's going to create what should we
[3:42:10.360 --> 3:42:18.000]  call it, more obedient, compliant, passive individuals.
[3:42:18.000 --> 3:42:20.720]  Let's try it out and see what happens.
[3:42:20.720 --> 3:42:27.320]  On the other hand, we think we may have a gene over here that we synthesized that could
[3:42:27.320 --> 3:42:30.800]  create a jump in IQ.
[3:42:30.800 --> 3:42:34.520]  Let's try it on these people over here and see what happens.
[3:42:34.520 --> 3:42:40.640]  Of course, nobody's going to know except us that we're doing this.
[3:42:40.640 --> 3:42:50.240]  We think we have a gene that actually works quite well to induce slow-motion infertility
[3:42:50.240 --> 3:42:53.200]  and sterility.
[3:42:53.200 --> 3:42:54.920]  Let's try that out.
[3:42:54.920 --> 3:43:01.000]  Here's a whole country over here, let's do that, and let's see what the statistics
[3:43:01.000 --> 3:43:02.000]  show us.
[3:43:02.000 --> 3:43:08.240]  We can always explain away the lowered birth rate by saying, oh, we can attribute that
[3:43:08.240 --> 3:43:14.000]  to the rise of the middle class and to cleaning up the environment and so on and so forth
[3:43:14.000 --> 3:43:18.480]  and astute medical interventions and crises.
[3:43:18.480 --> 3:43:25.920]  Sure, we've got unlimited cover stories for that.
[3:43:25.920 --> 3:43:28.120]  See what I'm getting at here.
[3:43:28.120 --> 3:43:36.840]  See where this is going, and yet it could be heralded within a national health insurance
[3:43:36.840 --> 3:43:37.840]  program.
[3:43:37.840 --> 3:43:40.680]  Hey, step right up and get your DNA vaccine.
[3:43:40.680 --> 3:43:45.880]  This is the latest and the greatest, and we're treating everybody to it because it's part
[3:43:45.880 --> 3:43:55.920]  of your right to have this and your children and your babies and your grandmother and grandfather.
[3:43:55.920 --> 3:44:02.280]  Everybody gets this one, folks, it's just part of what we're doing to share and care
[3:44:02.280 --> 3:44:09.920]  and help humanity improve its status and future.
[3:44:09.920 --> 3:44:16.440]  That's the way these things work, that's how they're promoted, and you will get untold
[3:44:16.440 --> 3:44:24.560]  numbers of idiots who will support this, absolutely, because somewhere in their brains they've
[3:44:24.560 --> 3:44:31.560]  been indoctrinated to believe in the idea of doing good.
[3:44:31.560 --> 3:44:36.240]  They don't know what it is, they don't know what it means, they just want to do good
[3:44:36.240 --> 3:44:38.080]  for others.
[3:44:38.080 --> 3:44:39.520]  That's the way they've been indoctrinated.
[3:44:39.520 --> 3:44:45.120]  So they're sort of waiting for somebody to tell them, what does it mean to do good?
[3:44:45.120 --> 3:44:46.120]  Please explain.
[3:44:46.120 --> 3:44:50.840]  Well, for example, if DNA vaccines next generation is going to be wonderful, well, immunize
[3:44:50.840 --> 3:44:56.000]  everybody and stuff, oh, good, that's doing good, yes, I'll help you out, I'll do whatever
[3:44:56.000 --> 3:45:01.920]  I can, I'll volunteer, I'll hold posters, I'll sit in drugstores and scoop people up
[3:45:01.920 --> 3:45:08.760]  and bring them over for vaccine injections, oh yeah, this is wonder, I've found the way.
[3:45:08.760 --> 3:45:17.320]  I now have found the way, indeed you do, you've found the way, you've found the road to perdition
[3:45:17.320 --> 3:45:20.160]  my friend, yes indeed.
[3:45:20.160 --> 3:45:25.960]  I'm looking at other frauds that will be involved here.
[3:45:25.960 --> 3:45:31.240]  Epidemic treatments, yes, we just announced a new epidemic, yes, threatening the globe
[3:45:31.240 --> 3:45:37.160]  indeed, but you're part of the National Health Insurance Plan compulsory and so you'll be
[3:45:37.160 --> 3:45:44.200]  receiving the vaccine and the drugs and all of that straight away, yes, you'll be at the
[3:45:44.200 --> 3:45:50.360]  head of the line and so on and so forth, turns out the epidemic is a total fraud.
[3:45:50.360 --> 3:45:53.800]  Never happened, never will.
[3:45:53.800 --> 3:46:00.640]  You want an example, I've mentioned it before, screw in your brain real tight again on this
[3:46:00.640 --> 3:46:12.440]  one, 2009, late summer, early fall, CVS investigative star reporter, Cheryl Atkinson, working at
[3:46:12.440 --> 3:46:15.600]  CVS uncovers an incredible thing.
[3:46:15.600 --> 3:46:21.120]  At the height of this swine flu epidemic, the CDC in America stopped counting cases
[3:46:21.120 --> 3:46:26.520]  altogether and didn't tell anybody they were stopped counting, oh that's their job, that's
[3:46:26.520 --> 3:46:27.520]  what they do.
[3:46:27.520 --> 3:46:33.920]  If they don't do that, they have no reason to exist, why did they stop counting?
[3:46:33.920 --> 3:46:39.320]  They're claiming there's a whole bunch of swine flu cases during the summer, sure, absolutely
[3:46:39.320 --> 3:46:45.440]  10,000, 12,000, whatever, but they stopped counting, why, why, why, so, Atkinson investigates
[3:46:45.440 --> 3:46:48.040]  and what does she find out?
[3:46:48.040 --> 3:46:53.680]  The overwhelming number of blood samples taken from the most likely swine flu patients
[3:46:53.680 --> 3:47:01.160]  in America are sent to laboratories and the overwhelming majority way, way up there of
[3:47:01.160 --> 3:47:09.200]  all those blood samples are coming back with no trace of swine flu, no trace of any other
[3:47:09.200 --> 3:47:11.200]  kind of flu.
[3:47:11.200 --> 3:47:18.840]  The whole thing is a hoax, the entire thing is a massive, massive hoax.
[3:47:18.840 --> 3:47:25.480]  She publishes that story on the CVS news website and suddenly everybody's CVS wakes up to realize
[3:47:25.480 --> 3:47:32.520]  what they've just done, they've exposed one of the most gigantic medical hoaxes in memory
[3:47:32.520 --> 3:47:40.640]  and now Atkinson and her editor are trying to get this story on the national nightly
[3:47:40.640 --> 3:47:46.840]  CVS news, which would be a much bigger, bigger deal because now that would raise hell, that
[3:47:46.840 --> 3:47:52.800]  would raise an incredible uproar and now they're shut down.
[3:47:52.800 --> 3:47:57.320]  Dead in the water, story's over, never going to show up again, bye-bye, never happened,
[3:47:57.320 --> 3:48:03.280]  don't worry, just keep your eyes straight ahead and walk and so forth.
[3:48:03.280 --> 3:48:11.080]  That's what I mean by an epidemic hoax and of course all the time of this gigantic hoax,
[3:48:11.080 --> 3:48:14.680]  people are being told you got to get the vaccine, you got to get the vaccine, this is great.
[3:48:14.680 --> 3:48:20.000]  Vaccine that caused a whole lot of serious health problems with people, whole lot of
[3:48:20.000 --> 3:48:25.600]  serious problems, but you got to get it, you got to get it because swine flu's coming,
[3:48:25.600 --> 3:48:28.520]  swine flu's coming.
[3:48:28.520 --> 3:48:36.160]  The whole thing was a gigantic hoax and yet, and yet because I haven't gotten to the punch
[3:48:36.160 --> 3:48:45.520]  line yet, and this is a real boggler, roughly three weeks after Atkinson published the story
[3:48:45.520 --> 3:48:56.600]  on the CBS News website, the CDC comes along and announces that their best estimate of
[3:48:56.600 --> 3:49:15.960]  the actual number of swine flu cases in America is, drumroll, 22 million, 22 million, not
[3:49:15.960 --> 3:49:33.560]  a peep from anybody, not a peep, 22 million from zero to 22 million, unbelievable, unbelievable.
[3:49:33.560 --> 3:49:40.160]  And in my story that those of you who are watching that's up here, you'll see the citation
[3:49:40.160 --> 3:49:47.720]  on where that story appeared, the CDC claim that was on WebMD.
[3:49:47.720 --> 3:49:51.560]  So this is what you'll get.
[3:49:51.560 --> 3:49:57.600]  I mean let's not even call it national health insurance compulsory plan and so forth, let's
[3:49:57.600 --> 3:50:06.840]  just call it the medical police state, medical slave camp, that's what they're lining everybody
[3:50:06.840 --> 3:50:13.440]  up for the next chapter, here's the next chapter.
[3:50:13.440 --> 3:50:22.160]  So I'm boggled, I'm boggled by this, even though I've reported on it one way or another
[3:50:22.160 --> 3:50:30.680]  for the last 30 years, I've boggled, I'm boggled by it, it's just unbelievable, it's all part
[3:50:30.680 --> 3:50:36.960]  and parcel of what you get when you submit yourself without knowledge or consent to the
[3:50:36.960 --> 3:50:37.960]  medical system.
[3:50:37.960 --> 3:50:43.920]  Yeah, sure, I'll go along for the ride, sounds good, more research, more medical treatment,
[3:50:43.920 --> 3:50:48.760]  more money for research treatment, yeah, all of that sounds great, sure, I'm on board,
[3:50:48.760 --> 3:50:52.920]  who wouldn't be, well somebody who's smart wouldn't be.
[3:50:52.920 --> 3:51:01.120]  I'll see you after the break, John Rapp.
[3:51:01.120 --> 3:51:05.120]  Extendivite really works, just listen to what some people have to say.
[3:51:05.120 --> 3:51:10.800]  About six months ago, my wife bought Extendivite, she didn't tell me she was doing it to me,
[3:51:10.800 --> 3:51:15.640]  so after about three days, I said maybe the weather's changed or something, I said my
[3:51:15.640 --> 3:51:19.560]  legs feel really good and she goes, well I've been giving you this stuff and it was
[3:51:19.560 --> 3:51:25.880]  just Extendivite, and you know that I'm about 75% better, I can actually climb stairs now
[3:51:25.880 --> 3:51:31.800]  and I can get up out of chairs, I can even get down and I've got to work under a table
[3:51:31.800 --> 3:51:36.040]  or a computer table and work on a computer, I can actually get back up off the floor.
[3:51:36.040 --> 3:51:40.200]  You know what, it's an amazing product, I can't believe, I didn't think anything short
[3:51:40.200 --> 3:51:42.600]  of having surgery was going to help.

[3:54:18.840 --> 3:54:26.200]  So everything that I've been talking about here over the last 45 minutes, the medical
[3:54:26.200 --> 3:54:33.360]  stuff, it's not happening in major media, you're not reading these stories day after
[3:54:33.360 --> 3:54:39.120]  day, my God, look at what's happening here and we've got reporters on the story and we're
[3:54:39.120 --> 3:54:45.240]  getting confessions from people, medically caused death, we never realized it before,
[3:54:45.240 --> 3:54:48.000]  nothing, absolutely nothing.
[3:54:48.000 --> 3:54:53.760]  These are the people who are talking about fake news, these are the people who are saying
[3:54:53.760 --> 3:55:01.960]  oh we're very worried about fake news, we have the actual news, we are the actual people,
[3:55:01.960 --> 3:55:09.960]  these are the people out there are pretenders, that's what they're saying, pretenders, yeah.
[3:55:09.960 --> 3:55:13.960]  So this guy named Trump comes along and I don't care what you think of Trump one way
[3:55:13.960 --> 3:55:22.360]  or another but what happened was he stimulated on purpose and quite naturally in his own
[3:55:22.360 --> 3:55:32.800]  way a backlash, serious backlash against the media by simply saying whenever he wanted
[3:55:32.800 --> 3:55:41.280]  to, you know, you're an idiot, this is a terrible interview, you're all a bunch of idiots and
[3:55:41.280 --> 3:55:46.240]  all of a sudden people began waking up and saying well that's what I thought, that's
[3:55:46.240 --> 3:55:50.440]  what I've been thinking, this is why I've been throwing things at the TV screen for
[3:55:50.440 --> 3:55:56.480]  the last ten years, all of a sudden people are waking up all over the place regardless
[3:55:56.480 --> 3:56:03.480]  of his platform, non-platform, his personality, what you think of him, whatever, whatever,
[3:56:03.480 --> 3:56:12.320]  it was a spontaneous combustion, see, he just robbed what I thought this guy Trump, I was
[3:56:12.320 --> 3:56:17.920]  the one who first realized that these media people are insane, remember honey, I told
[3:56:17.920 --> 3:56:28.080]  you that five years ago, now you got millions and millions of people saying, thinking in
[3:56:28.080 --> 3:56:34.960]  a much more positive and aggressive way, yeah the media's been lying to us all along, they
[3:56:34.960 --> 3:56:41.320]  are the fake news people and now the major media come back with this lame meme about
[3:56:41.320 --> 3:56:46.840]  the pretenders who pretend they're giving you the news, well I just gave you actual
[3:56:46.840 --> 3:56:52.560]  news, medical news for the last 40 minutes that you'll never get from any major media
[3:56:52.560 --> 3:57:02.880]  outlet in the world, it'll never happen, never, never has happened, never is happening, never
[3:57:02.880 --> 3:57:11.840]  will happen, you'll never get it, I just gave it to you here on Infowars and they're saying
[3:57:11.840 --> 3:57:20.520]  that we're pretenders, they're the ones who are through avoidance, omission, twisting,
[3:57:20.520 --> 3:57:28.520]  drawing, stepping on, tainting, all of their daily operations to give you this garbage
[3:57:28.520 --> 3:57:35.960]  pile that they call the news, the real news, the authentic news, yes I'm Anderson Cooper
[3:57:35.960 --> 3:57:40.960]  and this is the only place where you'll get the real story, these are the people are the
[3:57:40.960 --> 3:57:51.040]  fakers, well we know now, the whole game is up, millions, hundreds of millions I think
[3:57:51.040 --> 3:58:01.200]  at this point are ready to pull the switch on fake news, the seesaw has tilted, the game
[3:58:01.200 --> 3:58:09.800]  is not over, by any means they have the money, they have great deal of influence, but we're
[3:58:09.800 --> 3:58:17.000]  winning, don't go away, don't stop now, let's have the real news actually win, thank you
[3:58:17.000 --> 3:58:46.840]  very much, see you in a couple weeks.
