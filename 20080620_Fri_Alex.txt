[00:00:00.752 --> 00:00:02.493]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:02.493 --> 00:00:04.074]  You want answers?
[00:00:04.074 --> 00:00:04.995]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:09.838]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:09.838 --> 00:00:18.103]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:18.103 --> 00:00:20.404]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:20.404 --> 00:00:22.546]  It is the 20th day of June, 2008.
[00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:25.768]  Summer is just flying by.
[00:00:25.768 --> 00:00:27.609]  I am not Alex Jones, however Alex
[00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:31.098]  We'll be back in town this weekend.
[00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:34.259]  He will be doing his Sunday show in the fourth hour today.
[00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:39.601]  We're going to be replaying his interviews with Dennis Kucinich and Ralph Nader.
[00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:49.625]  And really, I just want to recap this week and make sure that things do not fall under the radar, especially the Mark Dice situation.
[00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:56.388]  I feel like we need to keep pressing on Michael Reagan and YouTube, just like we talked about yesterday.
[00:00:56.388 --> 00:00:57.408]  I'd really like to talk
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:27.065]  about this upcoming BBC special this hit piece I guarantee it folks the conspiracy files so far I can assess that the government spokespeople or the experts as they will be called will be Richard Clark Lizzo, Martin Lizzo that is if you don't know who Lizzo is he is the head of Control Demolition Incorporated a family-run business with heavy ties to the defense industry they cleaned up both Oklahoma City
[00:01:27.648 --> 00:01:29.709]  And the World Trade Center.
[00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:32.430]  Yeah, no conflicts of interest there.
[00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.111]  I know.
[00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:34.972]  Controlled demolition, just, they're innocent.
[00:01:34.972 --> 00:01:37.173]  They're, come on, they helped cover it up.
[00:01:37.173 --> 00:01:39.574]  That's why it's a family-run business, you know?
[00:01:39.574 --> 00:01:44.876]  He obviously has to sign papers in which, you know, he's not allowed to divulge certain things.
[00:01:44.876 --> 00:01:47.738]  When you work with the military, you sign away all your rights.
[00:01:47.738 --> 00:01:49.899]  The military owns you.
[00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.519]  Okay?
[00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:53.360]  Especially if you join them.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.641]  There is some new news out there.
[00:01:55.416 --> 00:02:00.540]  I want to talk about McClellan doubts Bush knew about the CIA leak, which is possible, I guess.
[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.663]  He wouldn't give the same reassurances about Cheney.
[00:02:03.663 --> 00:02:09.388]  Obviously, Cheney was one of the architects of leaking Valerie Plame's name along with Scooter Libby.
[00:02:09.388 --> 00:02:12.991]  It doesn't even matter that Scooter Libby gets convicted, you know?
[00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:14.832]  He doesn't really have to serve time.
[00:02:14.832 --> 00:02:16.754]  He gets his sentence commuted.
[00:02:16.754 --> 00:02:20.657]  It's really the first time somebody was pardoned, really.
[00:02:20.657 --> 00:02:21.638]  It was really a pardoning.
[00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.411]  Because he will be pardoned before Bush left office.
[00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:30.555]  He just commuted his sentence.
[00:02:30.555 --> 00:02:40.262]  Pretty unbelievable stuff, but yet it happens every day and the waking masses still seem to be asleep on a lot of fronts, unfortunately.
[00:02:40.262 --> 00:02:45.145]  And that's why it's our job to get out there and spread this message.
[00:02:45.145 --> 00:02:50.449]  And coming to the InfoWar on the 4th of July, Independence Day, I'm looking forward to it.
[00:02:50.782 --> 00:02:52.543]  I am looking forward to the 4th of July this year.
[00:02:52.543 --> 00:02:58.727]  I will be in Austin, Texas, but, you know, maybe Austin can show me a good time on the 4th of July.
[00:02:58.727 --> 00:03:18.498]  Anyway, 9-11 Chronicles will be out, so if you're done partying it up, you've already done the barbecue thing, you've done the family thing, you saw the fireworks, you come back and you had started downloading the 9-11 Chronicles Truth Rising, you can sit down and watch it on your computer with your PrisonPlanet.tv membership
[00:03:19.062 --> 00:03:22.623]  And probably get it before anybody else.
[00:03:22.623 --> 00:03:24.724]  It's a fantastic film.
[00:03:24.724 --> 00:03:30.846]  It's got confrontations with some of the highest levels of the global elitist, as well as many of their minions.
[00:03:30.846 --> 00:03:34.588]  You know, Zygmunt Brzezinski, Trilateral Commission.
[00:03:34.588 --> 00:03:37.169]  He's Obama's advisor at this point, folks.
[00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:38.609]  You better keep an eye on him.
[00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.210]  Authored the Grand Chess Board.
[00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.331]  Helped create radical Islamism.
[00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:44.732]  That's right.
[00:03:44.732 --> 00:03:45.332]  Mujahideen.
[00:03:46.604 --> 00:03:48.105]  Into Al-Qaeda, that's the guy.
[00:03:48.105 --> 00:03:54.167]  Just type in Brzezinski and Al-Qaeda or just, even if you type in Brzezinski, you'll probably find it.
[00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:58.868]  But there's this great, and I think they put it in Truth Rising, I know it's in my film, very briefly.
[00:03:58.868 --> 00:04:05.050]  But it's him in the 70s with a bunch of guns and Muslims radicalize them against the Soviets.
[00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.912]  And everybody goes, oh well, we needed to, we needed to help them because the Soviets were the enemy.
[00:04:10.912 --> 00:04:13.253]  Well, we had actually pre-positioned ourselves
[00:04:13.868 --> 00:04:35.884]  to attack the soviets and uh... that happened before the soviets invaded we wanted we'll never hear that in mainstream media the fable you know it's just like they don't want to cover uh... dolphin talking what really happened there are these false flag attack innocent intrusion of vietnam i'm gonna take colors in the next couple of segments it's the alex jones showing for wars dot com prison planet dot com
[00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:55.361]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:58.965]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:00.828]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:05:00.828 --> 00:05:04.472]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:05:04.472 --> 00:05:10.218]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:05:10.218 --> 00:05:14.123]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:05:14.443 --> 00:05:19.626]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:05:19.626 --> 00:05:22.688]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[00:05:53.735 --> 00:05:57.256]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:05:57.256 --> 00:06:02.657]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:06:02.657 --> 00:06:07.798]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:06:07.798 --> 00:06:18.921]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:06:19.321 --> 00:06:25.104]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:06:25.104 --> 00:06:31.368]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:06:31.368 --> 00:06:32.408]  What about you?
[00:06:32.408 --> 00:06:34.410]  Order your KDF shower filter normally.

[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:08.846]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened, and how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days.
[00:07:09.366 --> 00:07:13.327]  The package contains six DVDs that contain ten different programs.
[00:07:13.327 --> 00:07:17.248]  Two books that combined are over a thousand pages and other information.

[00:07:32.914 --> 00:07:36.938]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:07:36.938 --> 00:07:38.139]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:07:54.639 --> 00:08:01.242]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:01.242 --> 00:08:07.185]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.185 --> 00:08:08.526]  Alright folks, we are back.
[00:08:08.526 --> 00:08:11.628]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:11.628 --> 00:08:22.753]  And over at Infowars.com, they have great coverage of these drills that are going down in Florida and in Denver that involve these black helicopters that apparently don't exist.
[00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:30.992]  The black helicopters that were caught on tape don't exist, so don't worry about it.
[00:08:30.992 --> 00:08:35.314]  Everybody is, uh, dressed in black.
[00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:37.394]  It's a military, ex-military police.
[00:08:37.394 --> 00:08:39.135]  It's a combo pack.
[00:08:39.135 --> 00:08:47.338]  But again, black helicopters don't exist, so the drill probably doesn't exist, so martial law doesn't probably exist, and we should probably just ignore it all.
[00:08:49.025 --> 00:08:54.467]  And it doesn't, uh, happen to coincide with the DNC, even though that's just one of the most bald-faced lies.
[00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:55.828]  I just can't even believe.
[00:08:55.828 --> 00:08:59.490]  I mean, no one's, no one's that dumb, right?
[00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:07.433]  Everybody realizes that these drills that are running in Colorado right now, and I mean right now.
[00:09:07.433 --> 00:09:08.313]  Is today the last day of them?
[00:09:08.313 --> 00:09:08.954]  Yeah, it's Friday.
[00:09:08.954 --> 00:09:13.856]  So, here comes the weekend, and today is the last day.
[00:09:13.856 --> 00:09:16.297]  Anyway, so, uh, right now.
[00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:25.760]  Right now, they're training for urban warfare in preparation for the Democratic National Convention.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.121]  They have to make sure it's going to be an Obama love-fest, and they don't want legitimate protests out there.
[00:09:31.121 --> 00:09:43.544]  They don't want people with signs saying, you know, Obama's associated with Zygmunt Brzezinski, or Obama is a, you know, CFR, Obama's wife is CFR.
[00:09:43.544 --> 00:09:43.944]  They don't want
[00:09:44.642 --> 00:09:47.083]  You know, real conflicts of interest to be shown.
[00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:48.104]  So what are they going to do?
[00:09:48.104 --> 00:09:58.030]  They're going to bring in a bunch of goons that have shields, red paint apparently, and a violent attitude.
[00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.231]  And they are going to provocateur.
[00:10:00.231 --> 00:10:00.651]  That's right.
[00:10:00.651 --> 00:10:06.254]  They are going to provocateur violence on the first day.
[00:10:06.254 --> 00:10:09.176]  So they give it a black eye and protesting is bad.
[00:10:09.176 --> 00:10:12.558]  Further, further demonizing the first amendment.
[00:10:12.558 --> 00:10:12.778]  Okay.
[00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:32.600]  And as they demonize the First Amendment, this is going to be great, they'll just squelch down on the entire area and those who even had a permit, the one group that had a permit that is setting them up to look bad, had to change its name because we exposed them, but it's the same people.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.321]  You're probably going to have the same result.
[00:10:35.321 --> 00:10:36.781]  They're sneaky.
[00:10:36.781 --> 00:10:37.861]  They're not that sneaky though.
[00:10:37.861 --> 00:10:39.922]  I mean, it's right out in the open.
[00:10:39.922 --> 00:10:40.202]  Anyway,
[00:10:41.354 --> 00:10:45.615]  They're going to get their permit and the free speech zone is going to expand to everybody.
[00:10:45.615 --> 00:10:52.137]  It'll be much like the WTO and there will be no negative pins, etc.
[00:10:52.137 --> 00:10:53.337]  within a certain zone.
[00:10:53.337 --> 00:10:54.778]  I mean, you won't even be able to wear a pin.
[00:10:54.778 --> 00:10:56.278]  You won't be able to wear a T-shirt.
[00:10:56.278 --> 00:10:59.099]  The fear of inciting violence will be so strong.
[00:10:59.099 --> 00:11:07.721]  You'll have to be one of these puppets with like, you know, a donkey and an American flag pin on there and an Obama is change bumper sticker.
[00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:13.563]  And apparently they're busing people in, so you're not even going to be able to, you know, get close.
[00:11:13.563 --> 00:11:17.507]  You're going to have to go to a pen to be bused in, even if you're allowed inside.
[00:11:17.507 --> 00:11:24.353]  It's an incredible world we live in, folks.
[00:11:24.353 --> 00:11:28.757]  It is honestly just, it's beyond the pale at this point.
[00:11:28.757 --> 00:11:32.440]  But I want to read you this one off of Infowars.com.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.061]  We are changed.
[00:11:33.061 --> 00:11:35.443]  Colorado chases black helicopters in Denver.
[00:11:37.159 --> 00:11:41.923]  Truth Alliance and We Are Change capture history in the making.
[00:11:41.923 --> 00:11:48.407]  Preparations for the DNC are made in Denver as the military exercises drills in the city.
[00:11:48.407 --> 00:11:51.089]  All captured by We Are Change Colorado.
[00:11:51.089 --> 00:11:58.675]  Exclusive footage of the chase was caught by We Are Change Colorado members Jonathan, Turtle, Jason, Josh, Rob, Shannon, Nick, and Brian.
[00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.952]  A week of excitement exclusively captured by the crew in Denver.
[00:12:02.952 --> 00:12:07.115]  Here is the three-part video of the week's training exercises in Denver for all to see.
[00:12:07.115 --> 00:12:10.517]  Remember, this is over at InfoWars.com, if you don't believe me.
[00:12:10.517 --> 00:12:13.899]  If you're in your car and you're giggling.
[00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:15.520]  Urban warfare training drills.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.222]  Good, I hate them Democrats!
[00:12:19.222 --> 00:12:21.964]  Those liberals, they deserve to be penned up!
[00:12:21.964 --> 00:12:24.605]  Well, it's not about liberal or conservative, both of them are fake.
[00:12:26.837 --> 00:12:29.278]  But again, I think that we need a strong presence at the DNC.
[00:12:29.278 --> 00:12:34.000]  We need a strong presence of intelligent people that aren't there to provocateur violence.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:43.665]  Uh, maybe to hand out DVDs, to document the event, to interview people, you know, to try to get some candidates or that's going to be the hardest thing to do.
[00:12:43.665 --> 00:12:44.925]  Wow.
[00:12:44.925 --> 00:12:45.245]  All right.
[00:12:45.245 --> 00:12:53.369]  We Are Change Colorado has information on where the detention facilities will be for the DNC as well as, uh, the staging area and police HQ.
[00:12:54.773 --> 00:12:55.213]  That's right.
[00:12:55.213 --> 00:12:56.454]  They've already got the police headquarters.
[00:12:56.454 --> 00:12:57.334]  And everybody's in black.
[00:12:57.334 --> 00:13:04.037]  Again, this isn't like you're going to be able to identify who's who or what's what.
[00:13:04.037 --> 00:13:19.683]  The bottom line is, black uniforms, black helicopters, police headquarters of large quarters so they can just put you in internment camps, and free speech zones for those who didn't get a permit and the ones that got a permit want to provocateur the event.
[00:13:19.683 --> 00:13:21.384]  I really hope I'm getting through to a lot of people.
[00:13:22.049 --> 00:13:27.532]  I know that I'm kind of covering this heavy and it's a little bit early for the DNC.
[00:13:27.532 --> 00:13:31.253]  The DNC takes place August 25th to August 28th.
[00:13:31.253 --> 00:13:34.855]  But no one else is talking about this.
[00:13:34.855 --> 00:13:37.356]  And it is June 20th.
[00:13:37.356 --> 00:13:40.357]  So we're about 60 days away from this event.
[00:13:40.357 --> 00:13:41.598]  Now's the time to prep out.
[00:13:42.051 --> 00:13:44.052]  Now's the time to decide to go to Denver.
[00:13:44.052 --> 00:13:49.934]  Now's the time to educate other people when somebody starts to act violent and try to incite that.
[00:13:49.934 --> 00:13:51.034]  That that's the provocateur.
[00:13:51.034 --> 00:13:54.735]  When they throw paint on somebody, that's the cop.
[00:13:54.735 --> 00:13:59.737]  You know, I should pull up, I would pull up that Canadian clip, but the guy curses too much.
[00:13:59.737 --> 00:14:08.120]  This guy, he's wearing a mask, he's by, I don't know, a dozen or so protesters in Canada.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.761]  He starts saying, come on, let's throw rocks at the cops!
[00:14:11.374 --> 00:14:15.176]  And he's cursing at the cops, and this and that, and everybody's like, no man, you're a cop.
[00:14:15.176 --> 00:14:16.837]  We know you're a cop.
[00:14:16.837 --> 00:14:17.738]  No.
[00:14:17.738 --> 00:14:19.519]  You're a cop.
[00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:21.039]  Come on, let's throw this and that!
[00:14:21.039 --> 00:14:28.944]  So then the cops have to come in, and they take the guy down, and lo and behold, he's wearing the same exact cop-issued boots.
[00:14:28.944 --> 00:14:29.764]  Don't believe me?
[00:14:29.764 --> 00:14:32.186]  Throw it into Google.
[00:14:32.186 --> 00:14:36.148]  Throw it into... I also am a huge fan of the University of Google.
[00:14:36.148 --> 00:14:36.328]  I mean,
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:39.462]  Google's motto used to be, don't be evil.
[00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:41.503]  Obviously attended Bilderberg this year.
[00:14:41.503 --> 00:14:43.525]  Obviously has turned evil.
[00:14:43.525 --> 00:14:45.786]  We've caught them censoring Loose Change.
[00:14:45.786 --> 00:14:49.249]  We've caught them censoring Alex's films.
[00:14:49.249 --> 00:14:55.233]  And really, making the graphic user interface that much more difficult without a numbering system.
[00:14:55.233 --> 00:14:56.754]  You used to know what the top 100 was.
[00:14:56.754 --> 00:15:00.496]  So you could say, hey, we ranked such and such.
[00:15:00.496 --> 00:15:02.578]  You also used to see how many hits you had.
[00:15:02.578 --> 00:15:04.539]  Now you can only check the videos that you've posted.
[00:15:05.169 --> 00:15:11.592]  And it's just, it's ridiculously highly regulated.
[00:15:11.592 --> 00:15:21.397]  They have turned, uh, Google into their new little, uh, information gathering app, I think.
[00:15:21.397 --> 00:15:23.518]  You know, I really do believe that.
[00:15:23.518 --> 00:15:32.083]  And, uh, you know, it's unfortunate, but we gotta use the tools they're allowing us to have at this point, because they don't want us to have those tools much anymore.
[00:15:32.083 --> 00:15:33.243]  And that's what this show is about.
[00:15:33.243 --> 00:15:34.684]  This show is preparing you
[00:15:36.118 --> 00:15:38.639]  For what's to come and how to fight it.
[00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:40.780]  And what is to come is internet too.
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.621]  And we need to fight that big time.
[00:15:43.621 --> 00:15:50.664]  In Beaumont, Texas, right now, Time Warner has put in a new program where it's pay-by-bandwidth.
[00:15:50.664 --> 00:15:53.165]  Now let me explain what this means.
[00:15:53.165 --> 00:16:03.669]  Most people, it won't mean much, but if you're running a home business, or if you download content that is more than just pictures, in other words, let's say you have a subscription service, much like
[00:16:04.267 --> 00:16:05.107]  Uh, Netflix.
[00:16:05.107 --> 00:16:07.749]  I know there's, uh, some of these movie subscription services.
[00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:14.912]  And you pay, like, eight bucks, but you have unlimited downloads of all these Hollywood MGM movies, blah blah blah.
[00:16:14.912 --> 00:16:21.474]  Well, now if you start downloading those movies on top of that eight dollars, you're going to be capped at a certain amount.
[00:16:21.474 --> 00:16:27.417]  Let's say the movies are between... I don't know, let's say they're a little less than a gig.
[00:16:27.417 --> 00:16:27.917]  Alright, so...
[00:16:28.735 --> 00:16:41.862]  After 40 of those movies, and that doesn't include any other internet traffic, if you download some music or you visit some websites, after that you're going to be paying a dollar plus for each other movie you get.
[00:16:41.862 --> 00:16:46.285]  Why should I have to pay on top of what I'm already paying for the service?
[00:16:46.285 --> 00:16:48.366]  They're going to say, oh, you're using too much bandwidth.
[00:16:48.366 --> 00:16:53.509]  Well, in actuality, you're going to gouge grandma, who's going to use, I don't know,
[00:16:53.942 --> 00:16:55.903]  Maybe one giga month.
[00:16:55.903 --> 00:17:01.686]  Doesn't download anything but her email and pictures and surf the net.
[00:17:01.686 --> 00:17:03.207]  So you're making up for it there.
[00:17:03.207 --> 00:17:10.010]  Now if you have a business and let's say it's in the graphics industry or in the video industry.
[00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:12.291]  I mean these are industries that I'm familiar with.
[00:17:12.291 --> 00:17:15.693]  And you do a lot of FTPing which I've done in the past.
[00:17:15.693 --> 00:17:21.015]  You have to get this Photoshop file up or you have to get this uncompressed AVI up.
[00:17:21.015 --> 00:17:22.656]  Sometimes those are in the gigabytes each.
[00:17:23.536 --> 00:17:28.360]  And in a day you could go through 10, 20 gigs.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.522]  Now you're not a huge business.
[00:17:30.522 --> 00:17:39.110]  You're you and maybe you have a secretary that comes in a couple days a week and you know maybe you have one other person that helps out.
[00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:43.994]  Maybe a partner that does some of the editing or graphics with you.
[00:17:43.994 --> 00:17:45.015]  Now you're going to be penalized.
[00:17:45.015 --> 00:17:49.179]  How are you supposed to run your little business out of your small home?
[00:17:49.179 --> 00:17:50.480]  It's absolute nonsense and
[00:17:50.831 --> 00:17:54.472]  This paper bandwidth is just Nazism in my opinion.
[00:17:54.472 --> 00:17:55.593]  And that's just part of it.
[00:17:55.593 --> 00:18:00.275]  They're also training us to biometrically scan to get on the internet.
[00:18:00.275 --> 00:18:06.037]  Alright, that's what those little biometric scanner laptops, those IBM Thinkpads are.
[00:18:06.037 --> 00:18:13.199]  I was disgusted one day when my buddy comes and he's like, yeah man, oh, you can't get on, hold on, let me scan my thumb.
[00:18:13.199 --> 00:18:16.000]  I'm like, you have the biometric thumb scanner on your thing?
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.121]  He's like, yeah, it's awesome, no one can get on my computer.
[00:18:18.121 --> 00:18:19.442]  I'm like, you realize what that's for?
[00:18:21.138 --> 00:18:22.678]  And he's like, yeah, security.
[00:18:22.678 --> 00:18:27.319]  I'm like, no, for eventually it's going to be your identification when you surf the net.
[00:18:27.319 --> 00:18:31.700]  So from any computer, if you want to log on, you're going to have to scan your thumb.
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.561]  Say you're over at your buddy's, you want to get on the net.
[00:18:34.561 --> 00:18:38.642]  You're going to have to scan your thumb unless your buddy has already scanned his thumb and is logged in.
[00:18:38.642 --> 00:18:40.842]  But I'm sure they'll have a log out.
[00:18:40.842 --> 00:18:45.323]  And, uh, you know, the cameras are already all up.
[00:18:45.323 --> 00:18:46.883]  I mean, there's cameras on every single one.
[00:18:46.883 --> 00:18:49.444]  Don't think they're not tapped into those yet.
[00:18:49.444 --> 00:18:51.044]  See, that's what, that's another thing.
[00:18:52.085 --> 00:19:02.749]  This, uh, domestic wiretapping and surveillance, which was in place before 9-11, but 9-11 was the excuse why it, you know, it needed to be massaged into place.
[00:19:02.749 --> 00:19:08.811]  And then they even denied that they were wiretapping American citizens, but then it came out they were wiretapping American citizens.
[00:19:08.811 --> 00:19:16.174]  Then they lied again and said it was just American citizens who were making outgoing phone calls to these other countries or vice versa.
[00:19:16.667 --> 00:19:23.831]  It turns out that all that's a lie, and they're just tapping whoever they want, but they do it in a different fashion.
[00:19:23.831 --> 00:19:26.752]  There's new technologies out there, and they're utilizing them.
[00:19:26.752 --> 00:19:31.535]  That's why Google and Microsoft are at the Bilderberg meeting, man.
[00:19:31.535 --> 00:19:32.675]  Alright, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:32.675 --> 00:19:34.156]  We're gonna be taking your calls.
[00:19:34.156 --> 00:19:35.096]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[00:19:35.096 --> 00:19:36.377]  Thanks for having me this week.
[00:19:36.377 --> 00:19:37.798]  Alex will be back on Sunday.
[00:19:37.798 --> 00:19:41.479]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:19:41.479 --> 00:19:42.360]  Be back after the break.
[00:19:54.124 --> 00:19:56.465]  Gas prices are out of control!
[00:19:56.465 --> 00:20:00.347]  Fight back by doing what thousands of listeners to the Alex Jones Show have done.
[00:20:00.347 --> 00:20:03.388]  Developed by a major oil company, a product that really works.
[00:20:03.388 --> 00:20:07.149]  Introducing SFR's Protecta Complete fuel system and engine treatment.
[00:20:07.149 --> 00:20:09.910]  Just one bottle increases mileage for up to six months.
[00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:13.432]  Fleet tested by major oil companies showing improvements in every car tested.
[00:20:13.692 --> 00:20:17.373]  Stop paying mechanics your hard-earned money to have your injection system cleaned.
[00:20:17.373 --> 00:20:23.234]  Protekta cleans up to 95% of new injector condition in just one tankful and is safe for all cars.
[00:20:23.234 --> 00:20:30.695]  Tests conducted by General Motors conclude fuel injectors can partially plug in as little as 5,000 miles due to poor gasoline quality.
[00:20:30.695 --> 00:20:37.537]  Fight high fuel prices by purchasing a Protekta fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive an engine treatment free at $12.95 value.
[00:20:38.757 --> 00:20:40.818]  Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back.
[00:20:40.818 --> 00:20:42.698]  Go to oilcompanysecret.com.
[00:20:42.698 --> 00:20:44.679]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[00:20:44.679 --> 00:20:47.639]  Or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:20:47.639 --> 00:20:53.521]  That's 888-873-7371.
[00:20:53.521 --> 00:20:54.941]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:54.941 --> 00:20:57.762]  A new world order.
[00:20:57.762 --> 00:21:02.243]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:21:02.659 --> 00:21:05.483]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:05.483 --> 00:21:08.266]  Both their objective being world domination.
[00:21:08.266 --> 00:21:11.451]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:11.451 --> 00:21:18.800]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:21.812 --> 00:21:27.256]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:27.256 --> 00:21:30.638]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:53.253 --> 00:21:55.456]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[00:21:55.456 --> 00:21:58.398]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[00:21:58.398 --> 00:22:07.006]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[00:22:07.006 --> 00:22:10.690]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:15.234]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[00:22:15.234 --> 00:22:16.816]  How much are you willing to lose?
[00:22:17.196 --> 00:22:18.257]  Take action now!
[00:22:18.257 --> 00:22:23.059]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:22:23.059 --> 00:22:27.041]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:30.382]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[00:22:30.382 --> 00:22:36.805]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[00:22:37.105 --> 00:22:43.070]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.392]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[00:22:45.392 --> 00:22:47.113]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:22:53.288 --> 00:22:59.414]  Have you ever suffered from giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, arthritis, fatigue, or high cholesterol?
[00:22:59.414 --> 00:23:05.981]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans that the Center for Disease Control reports as suffering from internal parasites.
[00:23:05.981 --> 00:23:15.010]  If so, Freshwater Organics is proud to introduce you to a million-year-old miracle that has been used all over the world by health-conscious individuals seeking alternatives to chemicals and drugs.

[00:23:22.615 --> 00:23:27.898]  When taken daily, it is an excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.
[00:23:27.898 --> 00:23:30.900]  Many believe it is the key to a healthy digestive tract.

[00:23:42.208 --> 00:23:43.769]  You can also call toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[00:23:43.769 --> 00:23:43.969]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:24:16.351 --> 00:24:17.412]  Alright folks, we're back.
[00:24:17.412 --> 00:24:20.595]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:20.595 --> 00:24:21.616]  I am Jason Burmiss.
[00:24:21.616 --> 00:24:24.738]  You can check my stuff out over at loosechange911.com.
[00:24:24.738 --> 00:24:30.363]  I do a little blog there with Jonathan from We Are Change Colorado, Dylan and Cory.
[00:24:30.363 --> 00:24:34.707]  And if you want to email me directly, I do go through my MySpace and I do check out the emails.
[00:24:34.707 --> 00:24:38.370]  I can't get back to everybody, but I do read every single message.
[00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:41.953]  And some of the stories come out of those messages.
[00:24:41.953 --> 00:24:44.575]  Now before I go to callers, and we've got callers waiting in the wings,
[00:24:47.139 --> 00:24:57.665]  I would just like to read this State of Oklahoma Resolution because I've said secession a couple times and I guess that's not entirely correct.
[00:24:57.665 --> 00:24:59.406]  It's kind of wrong.
[00:24:59.406 --> 00:25:02.248]  I guess it's claiming sovereignty.
[00:25:02.248 --> 00:25:03.629]  Still pretty good.
[00:25:03.629 --> 00:25:04.770]  I'll take sovereignty.
[00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:06.371]  What do you think?
[00:25:06.371 --> 00:25:08.112]  Alright.
[00:25:08.112 --> 00:25:16.757]  A joint resolution claiming sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States over certain powers serving notice to the federal government to cease and desist
[00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:21.273]  And I could read the whole thing, but it's pretty long.
[00:25:21.273 --> 00:25:23.915]  Maybe we'll get into it later, but it's sovereignty what they've declared.
[00:25:23.915 --> 00:25:24.556]  And it passed 92-3.
[00:25:24.556 --> 00:25:25.377]  Go Charles Key.
[00:25:25.377 --> 00:25:25.857]  He's a Republican.
[00:25:25.857 --> 00:25:26.017]  Again,
[00:25:47.319 --> 00:25:48.820]  One person can make a difference.
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.501]  All right, let's go to George in Indiana.
[00:25:51.501 --> 00:25:54.403]  George, are you with me?
[00:25:54.403 --> 00:25:55.524]  Hey, how are you doing, George?
[00:25:55.524 --> 00:25:57.005]  I'm doing great.
[00:25:57.005 --> 00:26:08.971]  Listen, I have a question about this global warming scam they've got, and nobody's addressed this, and I think we ought to look into it if we had a climatologist or someone that could talk about it.
[00:26:08.971 --> 00:26:15.275]  What if, obviously we don't have global warming, but what if they do cut back on the CO2
[00:26:17.498 --> 00:26:19.199]  What can that cause in the future?
[00:26:19.199 --> 00:26:22.602]  I mean, are they looking to cause something to happen?
[00:26:22.602 --> 00:26:24.343]  I don't think that at all.
[00:26:24.343 --> 00:26:27.066]  I think it's kind of a joke to them.
[00:26:27.066 --> 00:26:29.007]  We're going to omit CO2 no matter what.
[00:26:29.007 --> 00:26:31.029]  I think it's more about charging people.
[00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:32.430]  That's what the carbon tax is about.
[00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:36.193]  So they'll still let you omit as much, quote-unquote, CO2 as you want.
[00:26:36.193 --> 00:26:37.374]  You're just going to get charged for it.
[00:26:37.374 --> 00:26:44.359]  But do we know what that actually would do to the weather when we change the CO2, when it's not going into global warming?
[00:26:44.359 --> 00:26:45.500]  Could it throw us into another
[00:26:45.782 --> 00:26:50.205]  Yeah, but what I'm telling you is we're never going to change our CO2 outtake.
[00:26:50.205 --> 00:26:52.726]  We're just going to start charging people for their CO2 outtake.
[00:26:52.726 --> 00:26:54.367]  It's not going to actually regulate anything.
[00:26:54.367 --> 00:26:59.831]  They'll put out some bogus numbers that we've cut this and cut that, but in reality, they'll just under-report it.
[00:26:59.831 --> 00:27:02.633]  And they'll make the people feel like they're doing something good.
[00:27:02.633 --> 00:27:12.219]  And in fact, all you're going to be doing is paying a couple, you know, a few, probably a few thousand for the average family every year because you have two cars, you have a big house, you use a lot of energy.
[00:27:12.219 --> 00:27:14.100]  You know how they're going to tap that tax?
[00:27:15.418 --> 00:27:17.020]  Yeah, Al Gore lays it out.
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.124]  Again, it's going to be how much carbon you use.
[00:27:19.124 --> 00:27:21.167]  They're already training kids.
[00:27:21.167 --> 00:27:27.198]  Listen, go to ABC, just type in ABC Planet Slayer into Google, and they literally have a carbon meter.
[00:27:27.915 --> 00:27:55.250]  where they show you two pigs one grown pig and one little piglet and in the middle is a is just a pool of blood which represents you after you put in the information and it tells you when you used up your carbon amount like the pigs live to be like I think it's a three years and six years old before they take up their carbon lifetime so the pigs are good but we use it up in somewhere between 14 and 18 months on this earth that's right before we can even walk and we should just die
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.541]  This is a bill that we're getting the mail?
[00:27:57.541 --> 00:27:58.502]  That's what I'm trying to find out.
[00:27:58.502 --> 00:28:00.063]  Hey, what's up man?
[00:28:24.605 --> 00:28:30.670]  Hey, uh, just, um, checking out, uh, C-SPAN the last, uh, last, uh, what was it?
[00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:31.611]  A couple of nights ago.
[00:28:31.611 --> 00:28:36.035]  And they were, uh, they were asking questions about torture and torture at Guantanamo Bay.
[00:28:36.035 --> 00:28:45.643]  And, uh, they're just, it seems like they're trying to get to the, get people documented saying where the torture orders are coming from.
[00:28:45.643 --> 00:28:48.345]  And well, let me address that for a second.
[00:28:48.345 --> 00:28:48.545]  All right.
[00:28:48.545 --> 00:28:50.887]  They've known about the torture for years and years and years.
[00:28:51.485 --> 00:28:52.866]  Uh, C-SPAN's been talking about it.
[00:28:52.866 --> 00:28:57.629]  It's one of the only news outlets that actually talks about real issues at times, uh, in-depth.
[00:28:57.629 --> 00:29:00.251]  The problem is that its ratings are piss poor.
[00:29:00.251 --> 00:29:02.493]  And, uh, you know, you and I watch C-SPAN.
[00:29:02.493 --> 00:29:06.415]  I watch C-SPAN almost religiously when I'm home because there's just so much gold on there.
[00:29:06.415 --> 00:29:08.777]  C-SPAN 1 through 3, I mean, you get the history.
[00:29:08.777 --> 00:29:12.319]  They have great trials from, like, the 70s and 80s.
[00:29:12.319 --> 00:29:13.480]  It's awesome, you know.
[00:29:14.986 --> 00:29:18.508]  At the same time, you know, look at what's come out in the public.
[00:29:18.508 --> 00:29:19.869]  Obviously they're torturing people.
[00:29:19.869 --> 00:29:21.510]  Obviously they have multiple units.
[00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:23.391]  It's not just Guantanamo Bay.
[00:29:23.391 --> 00:29:24.352]  It's not just in Iraq.
[00:29:24.352 --> 00:29:26.453]  It's not just Abu Ghraib.
[00:29:26.453 --> 00:29:26.814]  Stay there.
[00:29:26.814 --> 00:29:27.734]  We'll be back after this.
[00:29:27.734 --> 00:29:30.096]  It's the Alex Jones Show.

[00:32:16.203 --> 00:32:16.503]  I think so.
[00:32:40.626 --> 00:32:41.326]  Is it getting better?
[00:33:09.913 --> 00:33:15.217]  Or do you feel the same?
[00:33:15.217 --> 00:33:17.439]  Will it make it easier on you now?

[00:33:46.406 --> 00:33:48.508]  Much better than that Bono.
[00:33:48.508 --> 00:33:48.788]  Bono.
[00:33:50.399 --> 00:33:53.700]  Anyway, we're talking to Steve in Utah about torture.
[00:33:53.700 --> 00:34:01.602]  And before I give you the floor, Steve, I'd just like to point out that Kucinich had this in one of his articles of impeachment, brought up Abu Ghraib and everything else.
[00:34:01.602 --> 00:34:07.083]  So, I mean, this torture issue is out in the public, it's just that the masses are choosing to really ignore it.
[00:34:07.083 --> 00:34:12.665]  Otherwise, we would demand an impeachment of this president and the administration, no matter when it was.
[00:34:12.665 --> 00:34:15.766]  You know, it doesn't matter that it's the end of his term.
[00:34:15.766 --> 00:34:20.007]  Well, it just seems like they are getting people on record.
[00:34:20.643 --> 00:34:26.906]  And they're bringing people in and explaining how it's working and where the orders are coming down from.
[00:34:26.906 --> 00:34:28.407]  They're getting it documented.
[00:34:28.407 --> 00:34:35.911]  They're actually getting people that are in the government to state what's going on.
[00:34:35.911 --> 00:34:44.655]  Back in, I'm trying to think when it was, it's got to be now 2005, I interviewed one of the young gentlemen who went public at Abu Ghraib.
[00:34:44.655 --> 00:34:45.696]  And again, he was only
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:46.660]  We're good to go.
[00:35:07.489 --> 00:35:14.990]  So yeah, you'd have your general or your armed forces personnel inside there, but the dirty work would be done by these privatized military groups.
[00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:19.431]  So it gave them some sort of plausible deniability.
[00:35:19.431 --> 00:35:22.372]  My big problem is that it takes so long for anything to get done.
[00:35:22.372 --> 00:35:27.453]  These guys are murderers and torturers and a lot of times rapists, which makes me sick.
[00:35:27.453 --> 00:35:32.474]  And we're still having hearings, you know, five plus years later after the fact and
[00:35:33.143 --> 00:35:34.664]  At the end of it, who's going to be accountable?
[00:35:34.664 --> 00:35:35.684]  Four or five people?
[00:35:35.684 --> 00:35:38.985]  You know the top brass will never be accountable, Steve.
[00:35:38.985 --> 00:35:40.486]  I just... I... I see it.
[00:35:40.486 --> 00:35:41.947]  It's in my vision.
[00:35:41.947 --> 00:35:44.708]  Uh, Bush and the rest of them.
[00:35:44.708 --> 00:35:47.369]  Not just Bush, but you know... Yeah, Bush is a puppet.
[00:35:47.369 --> 00:35:48.869]  Bush is a puppet, bro.
[00:35:48.869 --> 00:35:50.650]  Yeah, people behind the scenes are the ones to watch.
[00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:51.711]  I thank you for the call.
[00:35:51.711 --> 00:35:56.432]  You know, Bush... Bush is a guy that reads what's written for him.
[00:35:56.432 --> 00:35:58.873]  He doesn't have an original thought in his head, folks.
[00:35:58.873 --> 00:36:01.835]  Well, maybe about some blow.
[00:36:01.835 --> 00:36:02.795]  Maybe about some, uh...
[00:36:03.564 --> 00:36:04.465]  Oh, what was it?
[00:36:04.465 --> 00:36:13.109]  There's this, if you watch Journeys with George, this is in the 2000 campaign, and it's the press corps following around George Bush.
[00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:15.791]  See, he was already anointed to become president.
[00:36:15.791 --> 00:36:17.091]  Again, Journeys with George.
[00:36:17.091 --> 00:36:18.112]  Give me a break.
[00:36:18.112 --> 00:36:25.396]  I mean, his brother literally, him and his brother laugh about how one way or another they're going to deliver, deliver Florida.
[00:36:25.396 --> 00:36:27.257]  But George, he can't wait.
[00:36:27.257 --> 00:36:30.199]  I mean, he knows he's on camera, and he knows that
[00:36:31.502 --> 00:36:34.623]  He's with the press corps, so he can't really let loose.
[00:36:34.623 --> 00:36:36.743]  And he's poppin' open a buckler!
[00:36:36.743 --> 00:36:39.884]  He's the happiest guy in the world with this buckler!
[00:36:39.884 --> 00:36:44.465]  And for those who don't know what a buckler is, it's a non-alcoholic brew.
[00:36:44.465 --> 00:36:45.965]  And it's disgusting.
[00:36:45.965 --> 00:36:48.066]  But he is... Go check it out.
[00:36:48.066 --> 00:36:49.426]  Bush and the Buckler.
[00:36:49.426 --> 00:36:51.327]  But Journeys with George is actually entertaining.
[00:36:51.327 --> 00:36:54.207]  It's way back in the day, one of those little independent films.
[00:36:54.207 --> 00:36:55.648]  God, I love documentaries!
[00:36:55.648 --> 00:36:58.768]  There's so much more interesting than the crap that Hollywood puts out, don't you think?
[00:36:58.768 --> 00:37:00.989]  I mean, every once in a while there's a decent movie out there, but...
[00:37:01.547 --> 00:37:04.649]  You know, that's why I'm involved with documentaries.
[00:37:04.649 --> 00:37:12.353]  And speaking of documentaries, before we go to Nathan in Iowa, 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising, coming at ya!
[00:37:12.353 --> 00:37:16.155]  PrisonPlanet.tv members are gonna get it first, 4th of July.
[00:37:16.155 --> 00:37:18.196]  That's right, the 4th of July.
[00:37:18.196 --> 00:37:19.617]  Independence Day.
[00:37:19.617 --> 00:37:21.098]  And you can get it in high quality.
[00:37:21.098 --> 00:37:24.099]  And it's gonna be a good time.
[00:37:24.099 --> 00:37:25.560]  I've seen the movie, I'm very excited.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:30.563]  Again, you know, you've got confrontations with Bill and Hill Clinton, Greenspan, Bloomberg,
[00:37:31.809 --> 00:37:32.349]  Okay.
[00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:35.011]  John Edwards.
[00:37:35.011 --> 00:37:39.414]  Big names like Brzezinski, Rockefeller, Schwarzenegger.
[00:37:39.414 --> 00:37:41.575]  I mean, the movie's jam-packed.
[00:37:41.575 --> 00:37:45.698]  You got interviews with Martin Sheen, which is an awesome interview.
[00:37:45.698 --> 00:37:49.060]  I'm a big fan of the Martin Sheen interview.
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:56.965]  More confrontations with Gary Hart, interviews with Willie Nelson, interviews with Jesse Ventura, interviews with Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:37:58.416 --> 00:38:02.257]  It's cinema verite, it's shot unlike anything you've ever seen from Alex Jones.
[00:38:02.257 --> 00:38:05.037]  Remember it, what is it, for PrisonPlanet.tv membership?
[00:38:05.037 --> 00:38:07.378]  It's less than 60 bucks a year, I know that.
[00:38:07.378 --> 00:38:10.118]  And it works out to something like 15 cents a day.
[00:38:10.118 --> 00:38:12.439]  You get all of his movies.
[00:38:12.439 --> 00:38:13.879]  It's the way to go, trust me.
[00:38:13.879 --> 00:38:18.120]  I was a PrisonPlanet.tv subscriber back in the day, I can promise you that.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.780]  Alright, let's go to Nathan in Iowa.
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:20.541]  Nathan, what's on your mind?
[00:38:20.541 --> 00:38:27.002]  Hey Jason, when you were talking earlier about Obama and the big no, I just had a call and recommend a book.
[00:38:27.455 --> 00:38:32.979]  For anyone, especially anyone that thinks that Obama is the lesser of two evils when it comes to McCain.
[00:38:32.979 --> 00:38:37.923]  I'm talking about Webster Griffin Tarpley's new book, Obama, The Postmodern Coup.
[00:38:37.923 --> 00:38:43.987]  And it's primarily about Zbigniew Brzezinski, the nature of fascism, and it really scared the crap out of me.
[00:38:43.987 --> 00:38:46.149]  I thought McCain was going to be bad before.
[00:38:46.149 --> 00:38:49.492]  Figured, you know, okay, how can he get much worse than going into Iran?
[00:38:49.492 --> 00:38:51.973]  At least Obama's going to get us out of Iraq.
[00:38:51.973 --> 00:38:53.975]  But what this book shows us is that
[00:38:55.054 --> 00:38:57.555]  First of all, he's not getting us out of Iraq.
[00:38:57.555 --> 00:38:59.455]  Let me promise you that.
[00:38:59.455 --> 00:39:02.056]  Change we can vote for is bull.
[00:39:02.056 --> 00:39:04.116]  He's never really said anything like that.
[00:39:04.116 --> 00:39:06.657]  He says he wants to work to get us out of Iraq.
[00:39:06.657 --> 00:39:09.518]  You can bet he's going to stay in the Middle East, but continue.
[00:39:09.518 --> 00:39:11.298]  Well, that's my point.
[00:39:11.298 --> 00:39:22.781]  If anything, if we pull troops out, it's just about saving our resources for the bigger event in terms of getting us in a war with China, Pakistan, and Russia, which I think is much, much, much worse
[00:39:23.399 --> 00:39:25.400]  ...than going after Iran.
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:50.311]  And what he shows us also is that fascism is different than just your mere totalitarian police state, and that fascism starts off as a grassroots movement that's really controlled by the bankers, much like Mussolini, his march on Rome in 22, and he's just this ideologue that's pretty much trying to take all everyone's anti-authoritarian, right now all this, like we know right now the polls show no one believes in government.
[00:39:50.311 --> 00:39:51.552]  He's supposed to take that
[00:39:52.099 --> 00:39:53.900]  And use this movement to seize power.
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:40:00.842]  And the point, I guess, is that McCain, he couldn't break strikes if our economy crashes.
[00:40:00.842 --> 00:40:01.962]  Obama could.
[00:40:01.962 --> 00:40:08.164]  McCain, it would be much harder for him to create, you know, universal military... Well, let me stop you just for a second.
[00:40:08.164 --> 00:40:10.084]  Let me just... Yeah, well, I agree there.
[00:40:10.084 --> 00:40:15.826]  The one thing that really does bother me about Obama is people do think that he's here to help America.
[00:40:15.826 --> 00:40:18.027]  People are blinded because he is a good speaker.
[00:40:18.027 --> 00:40:19.047]  He is charismatic.
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:30.028]  And I could see him being a Clinton-esque type leader where he's actually leading us towards doom and fascism when he's so well-spoken that we're just blinded by it.
[00:40:30.028 --> 00:40:34.552]  We don't have somebody as dumb and overtly evil as Bush.
[00:40:34.552 --> 00:40:35.332]  You know what I mean?
[00:40:35.332 --> 00:40:36.793]  So I think that's the big problem.
[00:40:36.793 --> 00:40:38.214]  I agree with you.
[00:40:38.214 --> 00:40:39.575]  I don't want Obama as the president.
[00:40:39.575 --> 00:40:40.736]  I don't want McCain as president either.
[00:40:40.736 --> 00:40:42.077]  It's a really scary time, brother.
[00:40:44.222 --> 00:40:45.723]  I really do think we're getting Obama, though.
[00:40:45.723 --> 00:40:46.544]  I hate to tell you that.
[00:40:46.544 --> 00:40:48.686]  I mean, I think they've set that one up.
[00:40:48.686 --> 00:40:50.367]  Let's go to Blue in Texas.
[00:40:50.367 --> 00:40:52.970]  Blue, are you there?
[00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:53.790]  You with me, Blue?
[00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:54.691]  Hey, how you doing?
[00:40:54.691 --> 00:40:56.673]  Pretty good, pretty good.
[00:40:56.673 --> 00:41:00.176]  Jason, I gotta say, you know, you're a brave man.
[00:41:00.176 --> 00:41:01.697]  You're a coal mine canary.
[00:41:01.697 --> 00:41:03.479]  Well, whatever.
[00:41:03.479 --> 00:41:04.860]  What's on your mind, man?
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:10.164]  Say, I've been listening to you for a while, while you've been filling in for Alex, and you're doing a good job.
[00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:16.913]  I just wanted to clarify something that you may have a misunderstanding about.
[00:41:16.913 --> 00:41:17.654]  Okay.
[00:41:17.654 --> 00:41:28.040]  Posse Comitatus, it specifically deals with how the Continental Army, Continental Army shall not be used as a police agency.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:38.145]  It does not specify ruling out the use of the naval assets of the Union or the Marines of the Union.
[00:41:38.145 --> 00:41:39.006]  In fact, today,
[00:41:39.847 --> 00:41:46.453]  You have Marines who are tasked specifically with intercepting email because it doesn't violate posse comitatus.
[00:41:46.453 --> 00:41:52.358]  And this has been a, you know, uh, an operation that's been going on for almost a decade now.
[00:41:52.358 --> 00:42:06.271]  Well, no, I, I agree with you there because if you look at the able danger hearings, um, they keep trying to make it about posse comitatus, but able danger was this blackout program that was getting all this open source information and they weren't saying how.
[00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:08.431]  And a lot of it was still classified.
[00:42:08.431 --> 00:42:09.812]  So that's probably what you were talking about.
[00:42:09.812 --> 00:42:15.575]  I'm sure they were working with Naval Intelligence as well as CENTCOM and the military.
[00:42:15.575 --> 00:42:21.339]  My big problem is that I don't really know that much about the jackboots on the street.
[00:42:21.339 --> 00:42:23.120]  That's more Alex's territory.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:32.826]  I do know that I'm very uncomfortable with seeing men in black uniform that are both current military and past military doing drills down in Denver in preparations for the DNC.
[00:42:33.311 --> 00:42:37.613]  Yeah, Black Ops Police, aka Black Water Police.
[00:42:37.613 --> 00:42:43.595]  Now, my concern is the ugly head, you know, that's reared itself recently in the form of torture ships.
[00:42:43.595 --> 00:42:44.716]  You know, U.S.
[00:42:44.716 --> 00:42:52.519]  Naval assets or, you know, Coast Guard assets that have been spun off and are now, you know, operating in international waters.
[00:42:52.519 --> 00:42:57.761]  And when they're done torturing you, if they kill you, they'll just dump you overboard and feed you to the fish.
[00:42:58.988 --> 00:43:01.910]  Well, I mean, hey, that's the new America, man.
[00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:06.453]  And I'm glad, I'm at least glad that the Supreme Court ruled that we do have habeas corpus.
[00:43:06.453 --> 00:43:12.076]  That really upset some of the bigger neocons, like McCain saying, you know, oh, this is terrible.
[00:43:12.076 --> 00:43:15.658]  And then Newt Gingrich saying we're going to have to lose an entire American city.
[00:43:15.658 --> 00:43:18.660]  You know, it's a bunch of propaganda.
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:19.620]  I mean, we have to fight it.
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:20.741]  That's the bottom line.
[00:43:20.741 --> 00:43:23.603]  And what I've been telling people is if you're upset,
[00:43:24.232 --> 00:43:25.212]  I gotta challenge your position.
[00:43:25.212 --> 00:43:27.653]  Out of respect, I agree that you have the right to your opinion.
[00:43:27.653 --> 00:43:28.933]  I see things fundamentally different.
[00:43:49.875 --> 00:43:55.617]  I think that, you know, the current political scene is just a stagecraft and theater.
[00:43:55.617 --> 00:44:11.581]  But none of this ultimately means anything, because when the food stops flowing and you have food riots, you'll have citizens with, you know, old-fashioned technology, guns, competing against, you know, cutting-edge, state-of-the-art military equipment.
[00:44:11.581 --> 00:44:13.882]  And they will ultimately prevail.
[00:44:13.882 --> 00:44:15.862]  Well, that's a bleak look at the future.
[00:44:15.862 --> 00:44:17.343]  I thank you for the call.
[00:44:17.343 --> 00:44:18.503]  I hope it doesn't come to that.
[00:44:19.091 --> 00:44:20.332]  I hope it doesn't either.
[00:44:20.332 --> 00:44:24.653]  I see the new old order winning.
[00:44:24.653 --> 00:44:30.235]  I hope you win.
[00:44:30.235 --> 00:44:34.717]  I hope you win.
[00:44:34.717 --> 00:44:35.817]  I know you do man.
[00:44:35.817 --> 00:44:37.678]  I thank you for the call Blue.
[00:44:37.678 --> 00:44:42.460]  All I can say is I'm not going to accept that reality until it's upon me.
[00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:46.901]  And if it is, hopefully I have prepared myself as that being a possibility.
[00:44:46.901 --> 00:44:48.262]  I hope it's not the probability.
[00:44:48.604 --> 00:44:59.250]  I feel like they like the soft incrementalism more than anything, and that's why you haven't seen, well other than the fact that we've exposed him, but a large-scale terrorist attack somewhere in the world.
[00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:02.892]  I mean, 7-7 was somewhat large-scale, but it's nowhere near 9-11, so.
[00:45:02.892 --> 00:45:05.113]  We haven't seen anything that surpassed that yet, I think.
[00:45:05.113 --> 00:45:08.115]  I don't know if they think they can implement it yet.
[00:45:08.115 --> 00:45:17.400]  You know, I've been looking into Codex Elementarius, and that's a big food restriction deal, and I am scared, you know, the Plum Island situation kind of scares me.
[00:45:17.827 --> 00:45:31.397]  Maybe I'll play that Plum Island clip after this and show how they're trying to move this bio research facility from off the coast of New York, which is on an island, right around farms and livestock in the middle of the country.
[00:45:31.397 --> 00:45:32.598]  There's four different spots.
[00:45:32.598 --> 00:45:34.880]  I think Manhattan, Kansas.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.082]  I believe that San Antonio, Texas is another one.
[00:45:37.082 --> 00:45:43.126]  I'm not sure where the other two are, but the ex-director of it is like, you don't want that anywhere near animals.
[00:45:43.126 --> 00:45:46.749]  He's like, I don't think you understand the people that work there aren't allowed to have pets.
[00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:54.211]  They're not allowed to go to the zoo or a circus if they've been working there in the past week because they still have the germs on their breath.
[00:45:54.211 --> 00:45:55.992]  So, is it a possibility?
[00:45:55.992 --> 00:45:56.532]  Yes.
[00:45:56.532 --> 00:45:57.952]  Hopefully it's not a probability.
[00:45:57.952 --> 00:46:05.753]  Hopefully, like I said, within the next two years we can decide again to become the government media and at least take over our local government.
[00:46:05.753 --> 00:46:13.034]  Again, Oklahoma just declared sovereignty in an overwhelming vote of 92 to 3.
[00:46:13.034 --> 00:46:14.435]  Alright, let's go to Bob in Alabama.
[00:46:14.435 --> 00:46:14.995]  Bob, are you with us?
[00:46:16.567 --> 00:46:18.088]  You're doing a great job, buddy.
[00:46:18.088 --> 00:46:18.928]  Thanks, man.
[00:46:18.928 --> 00:46:20.649]  A fella compared you to a canary.
[00:46:20.649 --> 00:46:22.430]  If you're a canary, you're a bull canary.
[00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:24.011]  I want you to know that.
[00:46:24.011 --> 00:46:24.971]  Thanks, man.
[00:46:24.971 --> 00:46:28.393]  There's a movie out called In the Valley of Eli.
[00:46:28.393 --> 00:46:33.996]  And for you biblically illiterate, that's the valley that David met Goliath.
[00:46:33.996 --> 00:46:37.278]  It stars Tommy Lee Jones and Charlize Theron.
[00:46:37.278 --> 00:46:42.481]  And it's about post-traumatic stress syndrome from soldiers returning from Iraq.
[00:46:43.582 --> 00:46:48.526]  It seems to me that the powers that be are trying to ignore this movie.
[00:46:48.526 --> 00:46:51.609]  It's great cinema, and it's from a true story.
[00:46:51.609 --> 00:46:53.891]  Well, I actually have it.
[00:46:53.891 --> 00:46:57.473]  I haven't popped it in yet.
[00:46:57.473 --> 00:46:58.174]  Do it.
[00:46:58.174 --> 00:46:58.975]  Alright, I'll do it.
[00:46:58.975 --> 00:47:04.419]  You know, I've met a lot of soldiers on this little journey of mine, and a lot of soldiers that have come around.
[00:47:04.419 --> 00:47:12.866]  And when I was in Colorado, I met this one soldier who literally had this really bad PTSD out there, and they had prescribed this
[00:47:13.459 --> 00:47:17.580]  This, I can't remember what it was, but, uh, he ended up getting nerve damage from it.
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:22.622]  But they were prescribing us this thing, and what it did is it made him more and more paranoid.
[00:47:22.622 --> 00:47:33.125]  And he was in charge of where they were going to cluster bomb, basically, where they were gonna send the, uh, the planes and bomb villages, and he would always think people were attacking him.
[00:47:33.125 --> 00:47:38.347]  He's like, look, he's like, I was paranoid as it was, and then they put me on this, and it caused nerve damage.
[00:47:38.347 --> 00:47:41.208]  And this guy had even went over to, uh,
[00:47:42.369 --> 00:48:09.454]  To Iraq again as a private contractor for Blackwater and after doing a tour there he just couldn't deal with it anymore and luckily he came home but he says you don't even understand what I'm going through even to this day and you know one of my best friends was over there and he doesn't even like to talk about it and he still can't even watch my movies because he doesn't want to believe that we were set up you know he doesn't want to believe that he went over there for anything but what they told him and I can understand that but
[00:48:09.924 --> 00:48:16.849]  I keep pressing on with him, and I keep trying to get him to take a look at this information, because he is one of my best friends.
[00:48:16.849 --> 00:48:19.732]  If something does go down, I want him by my side.
[00:48:19.732 --> 00:48:21.613]  Let's jump to Steven in Texas.
[00:48:21.613 --> 00:48:23.855]  Steven, what's up?
[00:48:23.855 --> 00:48:25.496]  Good morning, Jason.
[00:48:25.496 --> 00:48:27.598]  You're doing a great job, as usual.
[00:48:27.598 --> 00:48:28.158]  Thanks, man.
[00:48:28.158 --> 00:48:29.900]  In Alex's absence.
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.802]  The last time I called, there were a couple of things I wanted to cover.
[00:48:32.802 --> 00:48:34.283]  Let me ask you a question, first of all.
[00:48:35.548 --> 00:49:02.966]  I've got a good friend of mine who's been really up on the conspiracy for years, and he mentioned to me when I was talking to him a while back about, in Wired Sciences, I guess that's a site online, there was a thing about this thing called Shots Fired, which was some kind of new technology where basically under Homeland Security they can detect a shot fired by any gun anywhere in the United States.
[00:49:03.716 --> 00:49:05.518]  Have you heard anything about this?
[00:49:05.518 --> 00:49:10.762]  Not a thing, but I'm very interested in it, and if you do see anything, pop it over to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[00:49:10.762 --> 00:49:12.604]  I might Google that after the show.
[00:49:12.604 --> 00:49:31.020]  Yeah, and I wanted to mention, the last time I had two quick things, the last time I talked to you when you were shoving for Alex, have you got a chance to check out, yesterday I actually went to your site, the 9-11 homepage, Loose Change homepage, and sent you an email
[00:49:31.978 --> 00:49:38.263]  Again, as a follow-up to the last conversation which I had with you about Scott Loper.
[00:49:38.263 --> 00:49:39.904]  I did read that, I did read that.
[00:49:39.904 --> 00:49:45.908]  I don't really know anything about Scott Loper and I didn't get to check out, you had a site to check out, but I didn't really get to check it out.
[00:49:45.908 --> 00:49:47.249]  I got like 30 different tips.
[00:49:47.249 --> 00:49:54.594]  You know, Aaron Russo had, you know, America Freedom to Fascism and now they've got what's called RestoreTheRepublic.com.
[00:49:54.594 --> 00:50:00.719]  If people go on that site, the very first article that's on there, it's about Scott Loper and people need to get on board
[00:50:01.497 --> 00:50:07.838]  Uh, you know, this is a guy that was tortured by the Canadian authorities and kept confined in solitary for four years.
[00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:30.762]  And, you know, now that he's in the United States and so forth, our State Department has done nothing to help this guy, and yet here's an illegal Mexican that raped and murdered two women here in the Houston area back in 93, was convicted of murder and was gonna die, and Bush stepped in and stopped it because of the Vienna Convention, because supposedly he didn't get to contact the Mexican consulate.
[00:50:31.491 --> 00:50:36.716]  And, you know, so here's the hypocrisy, but the bigger picture is this, I believe, ties in with the North.
[00:50:36.716 --> 00:50:38.837]  Alright, Stephen, I gotta stop because we're going to break.
[00:50:38.837 --> 00:50:39.898]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:39.898 --> 00:50:42.520]  Go check out the Scott Loper story.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:44.442]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlan.com.

[00:51:55.383 --> 00:51:59.985]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:51:59.985 --> 00:52:04.528]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:52:04.528 --> 00:52:10.631]  Another untold story that you have not been told from AnotherUntoldStory.com
[00:52:14.321 --> 00:52:20.643]  In a previous Another Untold Story broadcast, we told of a change made in the church world in 1130 A.D.
[00:52:20.643 --> 00:52:26.585]  by one Anaclet II, a change in an ancient rite so that it no longer worked.
[00:52:26.585 --> 00:52:40.130]  Could it be that the workings of the generationally old conspiracy called today New World Order is not so new, and those in the know knew clear back then that it had to change this rite?
[00:52:40.130 --> 00:52:40.950]  Many say so.
[00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:56.440]  Many who have studied the New World Order know it's about control, control of people, people control, and the they who want to control us know that this ancient right must not only be eliminated from people's lives, but not even known.
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:03.587]  Because if the people knew of it and actually did it, the people would become uncontrollable.
[00:53:03.587 --> 00:53:04.648]  Who says?
[00:53:04.648 --> 00:53:06.570]  The master storyteller says.
[00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:10.314]  He said it, but most don't know he said or what he said.
[00:53:10.314 --> 00:53:14.638]  They do, and they don't want you, they don't want us to do it.
[00:53:15.339 --> 00:53:20.943]  It's so simple to do, and when the people do do it, they become uncontrollable.
[00:53:20.943 --> 00:53:21.563]  What is it?
[00:53:21.563 --> 00:53:22.564]  Find out!

[00:53:53.483 --> 00:53:56.526]  Way up north to Alaska.
[00:53:56.526 --> 00:54:00.049]  Way up north to Alaska.
[00:54:00.049 --> 00:54:02.512]  North to Alaska.
[00:54:02.512 --> 00:54:04.454]  Go north for us is on.
[00:54:06.713 --> 00:54:15.158]  We love singing that one in the office.
[00:54:15.158 --> 00:54:16.719]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:16.719 --> 00:54:18.860]  I'm Jason Burmess.
[00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:24.483]  Ending a week-long tirade over here at InfoWars.
[00:54:24.483 --> 00:54:26.825]  The command center at Austin, Texas.
[00:54:26.825 --> 00:54:28.406]  Alex will be back this weekend.
[00:54:29.198 --> 00:54:31.199]  He'll be doing his Sunday show.
[00:54:31.199 --> 00:54:32.120]  I'm taking callers.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:37.743]  It's wide open phones today for three whole hours on the Alex Jones Show, believe it or not.
[00:54:37.743 --> 00:54:43.527]  And, uh, in the fourth hour, we're going to replay that all-important Kucinich interview and the Nader interview as well.
[00:54:43.527 --> 00:54:50.431]  But, Koos-Koos, as I like to call him, the number one stunner out in, uh, Congress right now.
[00:54:50.431 --> 00:54:56.735]  35 articles of impeachment, the last three of which dealing with 9-11, others dealing with, uh, domestic wiretapping, torture.
[00:54:56.735 --> 00:54:57.676]  You betcha.
[00:54:58.362 --> 00:54:58.902]  You go.
[00:54:58.902 --> 00:55:00.923]  You go, Kucinich.
[00:55:00.923 --> 00:55:02.983]  It's not just about having a hot wife.
[00:55:02.983 --> 00:55:06.144]  It's about bringing these people to justice, couscous.
[00:55:06.144 --> 00:55:06.764]  And he knows that.
[00:55:06.764 --> 00:55:11.505]  And he said if they don't do anything, he's going to introduce 60 articles on the House floor.
[00:55:11.505 --> 00:55:14.506]  Now, I know a lot of you out there didn't watch it.
[00:55:14.506 --> 00:55:18.287]  Maybe some of you out there, it's the first time you're hearing about it for some reason.
[00:55:18.287 --> 00:55:23.888]  I know most of Jones's audience is pretty hip, but maybe you're on the road and you're just flipping through.
[00:55:23.888 --> 00:55:27.949]  35 articles of impeachment over three hours on the House with almost nobody in attendance.
[00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:32.415]  And he said he would introduce 60 if it took him over 8 hours.
[00:55:32.415 --> 00:55:33.677]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:55:33.677 --> 00:55:35.199]  He's my man.
[00:55:35.199 --> 00:55:37.001]  Alright, let's go to Rand in Texas.
[00:55:37.001 --> 00:55:38.443]  Rand, what's up?
[00:55:38.443 --> 00:55:39.424]  Hey, great show.
[00:55:39.424 --> 00:55:39.925]  Thanks, man.
[00:55:39.925 --> 00:55:42.708]  I just wanted to agree with you about a couple of points.
[00:55:42.708 --> 00:55:45.812]  First, Bush has never had an original thought in his life.
[00:55:47.134 --> 00:55:50.596]  And I don't think any of his brothers or his father have either.
[00:55:50.596 --> 00:55:55.139]  They're just these spoiled, arrogant little punks.
[00:55:55.139 --> 00:56:02.844]  Draft Dodgers, Chicken Hawks couldn't think their way out of a paper bag and they become President of the United States.
[00:56:02.844 --> 00:56:04.285]  I would say that Bush Sr.
[00:56:04.285 --> 00:56:05.526]  is really a schemer.
[00:56:05.526 --> 00:56:07.187]  I don't know about Jeb and Neal.
[00:56:07.187 --> 00:56:08.108]  I feel like they run
[00:56:08.729 --> 00:56:12.876]  I don't really think he's got any more brains than his sons do, but he's part of the old guard.
[00:56:21.488 --> 00:56:28.951]  That the levers, the hands that are on the levers of control of our government now, really a lot of the same ones that were around in JFK assassination.
[00:56:28.951 --> 00:56:30.431]  Yeah, well that's what I'm talking about.
[00:56:30.431 --> 00:56:36.933]  You got Bobby Bush, and then Kissinger, and then you get into the Iran-Contra scandal.
[00:56:36.933 --> 00:56:40.255]  We had Elliott Abrams, and Wolfowitz, and Cheney, and all these guys.
[00:56:40.255 --> 00:56:43.956]  I mean, these guys, they're part of this old guard, you know?
[00:56:44.096 --> 00:56:48.802]  And they live in this world where deceit masquerades as virtue.
[00:56:48.802 --> 00:56:58.994]  They've got their Zionist-run propaganda machine spoon-feeding the American cattle into believing they're virtuous and right on and stuff.
[00:56:58.994 --> 00:56:59.935]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:56:59.935 --> 00:57:01.657]  Have you seen JFK 2 The Bush Connection?
[00:57:02.242 --> 00:57:02.482]  Yeah.
[00:57:18.759 --> 00:57:22.600]  But he was able to stay covert until he actually became the head of the CIA.
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:25.721]  Right, he just disappeared out of nowhere.
[00:57:25.721 --> 00:57:26.961]  I think that was his paper.
[00:57:26.961 --> 00:57:37.224]  Nixon was going down in Watergate when he appointed both Bush as director of the CIA and John Connolly as Secretary of Treasury.
[00:57:37.224 --> 00:57:40.644]  Secretary of Treasury John Connolly was going down in the milk fund scandal.
[00:57:40.644 --> 00:57:42.725]  I mean, did he get appointed Secretary of Treasury?
[00:57:44.826 --> 00:57:49.971]  Well, you know, the American people's been asleep for a very long time, my friend.
[00:57:49.971 --> 00:57:51.432]  Thank you for the call.
[00:57:51.432 --> 00:57:55.195]  I still think that Bush Senior's a little bit smarter of a schemer.
[00:57:55.195 --> 00:58:00.039]  You know, even if he is, and I don't think he's top-level management, I think he's also a ruthless killer.
[00:58:00.039 --> 00:58:07.806]  I mean, all fingers point to him having an involvement in JFK's assassination, and obviously
[00:58:09.076 --> 00:58:12.139]  You know, he was not a good guy when he was in the CIA.
[00:58:12.139 --> 00:58:14.240]  I ran Contra all over the place, you better believe it.
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:19.945]  Then he becomes the vice president under an actor for eight years, and then the president for four more.
[00:58:19.945 --> 00:58:23.228]  And then the next president is a guy who ran Coke for him in the 80s!

[01:00:06.807 --> 01:00:12.410]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:13.070]  All right!
[01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:15.451]  Second hour for all those joining us.
[01:00:15.451 --> 01:00:17.812]  I'm not Alex Jones, I am Jason Burmess.

[01:00:21.674 --> 01:00:26.457]  Ending a week-long run on the Alex Jones Show, Alex will be back for his Sunday program.
[01:00:27.285 --> 01:00:34.867]  And all next week, of course, in the final hour, we will have his Dennis Kucinich and Ralph Nader interviews.
[01:00:34.867 --> 01:00:40.588]  Great stuff there, if you missed it last week, Dennis talks about his 35 articles of impeachment.
[01:00:40.588 --> 01:00:47.050]  And I know I think it was it may have been off air or during the break, which was on the Internet stream.
[01:00:47.050 --> 01:00:51.511]  But Kucinich actually called Alex the voice of America.
[01:00:51.511 --> 01:00:54.192]  And I was out in the office and I was like, this is great, you know.
[01:00:54.690 --> 01:00:56.971]  Finally, you know, Kucinich has come around.
[01:00:56.971 --> 01:01:04.454]  I mean, Kucinich was in, uh... Alex's film in 2003, American Dictators.
[01:01:04.454 --> 01:01:06.674]  2003, 2004, somewhere around there.
[01:01:06.674 --> 01:01:09.616]  And, uh, he was very limited at that point.
[01:01:09.616 --> 01:01:13.937]  Still had some good things to say, and you could see he was gonna come around, but he's come full circle.
[01:01:13.937 --> 01:01:18.879]  He's one of the allies in this info war.
[01:01:18.879 --> 01:01:21.120]  Big ups to my man, Kucinich.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:24.081]  Alright, like I said, we're taking your phone calls all three hours, it looks like.
[01:01:25.057 --> 01:01:32.539]  Let's go to Jeremy in Kentucky, and then I'm going to play this World Trade Center 7 conspiracy files clip.
[01:01:32.539 --> 01:01:34.640]  I said I was going to play it in the beginning of the show.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:38.541]  I still haven't played it, so we're going to pop that off, and I'd love some Building 7 calls.
[01:01:38.541 --> 01:01:40.542]  All right, Jeremy, what's on your mind?
[01:01:40.542 --> 01:01:43.142]  Yes, I just got back from Iraq.
[01:01:43.142 --> 01:01:47.264]  I'm actually a soldier in the Special Forces community.
[01:01:47.264 --> 01:01:48.204]  Okay.
[01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:51.605]  Had a buddy of mine from the National Guard.
[01:01:51.605 --> 01:01:53.145]  We had to work together.
[01:01:53.145 --> 01:01:54.406]  Had a couple of buddies of mine
[01:01:55.765 --> 01:02:04.950]  They were pretty open-minded and I kind of let him because I kind of became aware, as I call it, about a year ago.
[01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:07.251]  So I read that book while I had time over there.
[01:02:07.251 --> 01:02:08.012]  What book?
[01:02:08.012 --> 01:02:09.412]  I was trying to look up his name.
[01:02:09.412 --> 01:02:10.533]  What book?
[01:02:10.533 --> 01:02:12.214]  A guy named Percy something.
[01:02:12.214 --> 01:02:15.576]  He wrote the book, Am I the Only American That Feels This Way?
[01:02:15.576 --> 01:02:17.717]  I've never heard of it, but continue.
[01:02:17.717 --> 01:02:21.819]  Yeah, he knows the Constitution really well.
[01:02:21.819 --> 01:02:23.000]  He knows the law better than most
[01:02:24.079 --> 01:02:25.240]  Judges do.
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.802]  So me and this guy got together since he's in the National Guard.
[01:02:27.802 --> 01:02:29.223]  He's a really smart guy.
[01:02:29.223 --> 01:02:34.627]  He pretty much aced the entrance exam for the military even though everyone thinks soldiers are idiots.
[01:02:34.627 --> 01:02:37.670]  There's a lot of smart people in the military.
[01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:50.360]  And we come up with a plan that he's going to sue the governor for sending him because he found a way that he can do it because the state wasn't actually in any type of emergency.
[01:02:51.004 --> 01:02:52.524]  We're being attacked in any way.
[01:02:52.524 --> 01:02:56.185]  Oh, so he's going to sue because he's a National Guardsman and they sent him to Iraq.
[01:02:56.185 --> 01:02:57.785]  I mean, I can't, but he can.
[01:02:57.785 --> 01:03:00.086]  No, my buddy was sent as a National Guardsman.
[01:03:00.086 --> 01:03:01.926]  I mean, I took the ASFAB test with him.
[01:03:01.926 --> 01:03:04.807]  I didn't end up joining, but he ended up joining.
[01:03:04.807 --> 01:03:08.187]  And a couple of years after he joined, he went overseas.
[01:03:08.187 --> 01:03:14.269]  He was in Ramadi and he spent, I think it was between six months and a year over there, got blown up by an IED.
[01:03:16.522 --> 01:03:19.865]  Lost his hearing in one ear, but I would love to see that, man.
[01:03:19.865 --> 01:03:21.546]  Have you watched any of the documentaries?
[01:03:21.546 --> 01:03:24.128]  You're obviously listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:03:24.128 --> 01:03:27.770]  So, I mean, what was it other than this book?
[01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:30.112]  Have you seen some of the other information out there?
[01:03:30.112 --> 01:03:34.255]  I mean, I bought The Endgame for him.
[01:03:34.255 --> 01:03:38.238]  After he watched it, he's a really smart guy.
[01:03:38.238 --> 01:03:41.100]  And he's in his thirties as well.
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:43.282]  He's probably one of the smartest guys I think I've ever met.
[01:03:43.969 --> 01:03:59.352]  And, um, I've been around, I mean, my mom's a college professor, I've been around a lot of smart people, um, and, uh, after I set him loose on, uh, Terror Storm, I owned that one as well, we watched Loose Change, you know, I brought everyone over here, that's kind of how it started.
[01:03:59.352 --> 01:03:59.692]  Gotcha.
[01:03:59.692 --> 01:04:04.613]  I think I actually met one of the guys, wasn't one of them at Fort Campbell?
[01:04:04.613 --> 01:04:07.133]  Uh, yeah, you probably met, uh, Corey.
[01:04:07.133 --> 01:04:11.754]  Yeah, it was one of them, I met him, I was getting a haircut, and he was passing out these discs.
[01:04:11.754 --> 01:04:13.094]  Yeah, that was definitely Corey.
[01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:14.477]  That's hilarious.
[01:04:14.477 --> 01:04:16.479]  In 2002, I think it was, and I had no idea.
[01:04:16.479 --> 01:04:18.361]  I didn't know anything, you know.
[01:04:18.361 --> 01:04:21.024]  I was a completely different person there anyways, and I didn't even know what it was.
[01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:26.369]  I didn't, to be honest with you, I didn't even watch it, but years later, I said, I've heard of that name somewhere, and I figured it out.
[01:04:26.369 --> 01:04:28.171]  Hey, Jeremy, thank you so much, man.
[01:04:28.171 --> 01:04:29.012]  Keep up the great work.
[01:04:29.012 --> 01:04:30.153]  We need more people like you.
[01:04:30.153 --> 01:04:34.698]  I hope that you join Operation Inform the Soldiers and send some stuff over to Iraq.
[01:04:34.698 --> 01:04:36.560]  InfoWars.com, we'll be back after this.
[01:04:50.805 --> 01:04:52.226]  It is a big idea.
[01:04:52.226 --> 01:04:55.047]  A New World Order.
[01:04:55.047 --> 01:04:59.548]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:04:59.548 --> 01:05:02.769]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:05:02.769 --> 01:05:05.550]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:08.731]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:05:08.731 --> 01:05:16.054]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:05:19.096 --> 01:05:24.520]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:28.382]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:05:28.382 --> 01:05:30.964]  The Oberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:05:30.964 --> 01:05:32.145]  Most people have no idea.
[01:05:32.145 --> 01:05:32.925]  They're not after money.
[01:05:32.925 --> 01:05:34.186]  They have all the money they need.
[01:05:34.186 --> 01:05:35.187]  They're after power.
[01:05:35.187 --> 01:05:36.328]  That's what I have to do, sir.
[01:05:36.328 --> 01:05:45.033]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:56.363]  Do you feel powerless against the large oil companies?

[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:39.820]  Mention GCN Live for a free gift!
[01:07:50.578 --> 01:07:57.243]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:57.243 --> 01:08:00.425]  Alright, we're back folks, and that caller was awesome.
[01:08:00.425 --> 01:08:11.613]  You see, that's why Operation Inform the Soldier is so important, that's why you need to take up on this program where you mail soldiers care packages with these truth DVDs, it does make a difference.
[01:08:12.355 --> 01:08:20.723]  You know, Corey Rowe handed him a very rough cut of Loose Change, the original, way back in the day when Dylan first started it from Fort Campbell.
[01:08:20.723 --> 01:08:22.125]  Think about that.
[01:08:22.125 --> 01:08:24.207]  Think about how that's come full circle.
[01:08:24.207 --> 01:08:25.088]  It's 2008.
[01:08:25.088 --> 01:08:28.791]  He said he just really woke up a little over a year ago.
[01:08:28.791 --> 01:08:29.933]  You know?
[01:08:29.933 --> 01:08:31.714]  I mean, that encourages me.
[01:08:31.714 --> 01:08:33.316]  You know, he's a Special Forces guy.
[01:08:34.371 --> 01:08:34.971]  So there you go.
[01:08:34.971 --> 01:08:39.434]  You know, all those debunkers and scumbags out there that want to degenerate what we're doing.
[01:08:39.434 --> 01:08:45.697]  The people like Michael Reagan who want to call for our murders because we're trying to do the right thing.
[01:08:45.697 --> 01:08:46.977]  There are soldiers behind us.
[01:08:46.977 --> 01:08:49.098]  There are soldiers waking up.
[01:08:49.098 --> 01:08:59.043]  That's why it's important to get a copy of Loose Change or get a copy of, you know, Terror Storm, Martial Law, Road to Tyranny, and then just dupe copies, man.
[01:08:59.043 --> 01:09:00.304]  I don't care.
[01:09:00.304 --> 01:09:01.264]  Download them off the net.
[01:09:01.264 --> 01:09:02.645]  Get them off the file sharing networks.
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:08.203]  I mean, if you want to make it easy, it's easy to become a PrisonPlanet.TV member.
[01:09:08.203 --> 01:09:10.585]  All Alex's films, Loose Change is on there.
[01:09:10.585 --> 01:09:11.986]  I'm trying to think what else is on.
[01:09:11.986 --> 01:09:14.247]  I'm pretty sure America's Freedom of Fashion is on.
[01:09:14.247 --> 01:09:15.248]  Fascism is on there.
[01:09:15.248 --> 01:09:22.353]  There's just a ton of stuff on PrisonPlanet.TV, plus his weekly television show, plus the new live hour feed.
[01:09:22.353 --> 01:09:31.299]  If you tuned in any of the last four days, the last hour is actually on PrisonPlanet.TV video, and they post it on YouTube for free afterwards.
[01:09:31.299 --> 01:09:32.460]  But if you want to see it live,
[01:09:33.109 --> 01:09:34.610]  Again, you can't beat it.
[01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:42.535]  And I'll tell you right now, Truth Rising is going to be at PrisonPlan.TV first, and the 9-11 Chronicles is something you're not going to want to miss.
[01:09:42.535 --> 01:09:47.819]  It really is the next step in the Alex Jones film evolution.
[01:09:47.819 --> 01:09:54.843]  Alright, so let's play this Conspiracy Files BBC trailer, and then we're going to continue to take your calls on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:09:54.843 --> 01:09:57.605]  Infowars.com, folks, is where you're going to find all the coverage.
[01:10:23.414 --> 01:10:26.955]  Building 7 is the smoking gun of 9-11.
[01:10:26.955 --> 01:10:31.197]  It is the most obvious example of controlled demolition.
[01:10:32.731 --> 01:10:34.052]  It's not real.
[01:10:34.052 --> 01:10:37.935]  The materials and the technologies just aren't there.
[01:10:37.935 --> 01:10:40.117]  If they were, I'd know.
[01:10:40.117 --> 01:10:41.779]  In the building, I heard explosions.
[01:10:41.779 --> 01:10:47.524]  Outside the building, I heard explosions.
[01:10:47.524 --> 01:10:52.748]  I saw this building, which had never been hit by a plane, come crashing straight down.
[01:10:52.748 --> 01:10:58.433]  For it to fall symmetrically and completely and rapidly was quite astounding.
[01:10:59.127 --> 01:11:02.408]  Could one use a controlled demolition on any building?
[01:11:02.408 --> 01:11:02.669]  Sure.
[01:11:02.669 --> 01:11:05.190]  Did it happen to the WTC7 on 9-11?
[01:11:05.190 --> 01:11:12.693]  No, it did not.
[01:11:12.693 --> 01:11:15.314]  As far as I know, that's the first time it's happened in architectural history.
[01:11:15.314 --> 01:11:19.276]  A steel high-rise building has collapsed simply because of damage and fire.
[01:11:19.276 --> 01:11:20.997]  You can hear the building creak.
[01:11:20.997 --> 01:11:22.457]  You can hear things fall.
[01:11:22.457 --> 01:11:24.338]  You can hear the fire burning.
[01:11:24.338 --> 01:11:26.279]  And you can hear the destruction way above it.
[01:11:29.457 --> 01:11:37.178]  No steel frame high-rise building has ever collapsed due to fire.
[01:11:37.178 --> 01:11:39.159]  You know, you have to look at what was inside Building 7.
[01:11:39.159 --> 01:11:42.579]  You had the largest Secret Service field office outside of Washington, D.C.
[01:11:42.579 --> 01:11:44.720]  You had the largest CIA field office.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:47.280]  You had a number of government agencies inside the building.
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:50.941]  I think we're just about the last ones in this building right now.
[01:11:50.941 --> 01:11:51.961]  I think you should leave.
[01:11:51.961 --> 01:11:52.921]  Everybody else is gone.
[01:11:59.531 --> 01:12:01.312]  The first explosion I heard was when I was on the stairwell.
[01:12:01.312 --> 01:12:05.075]  Like a boom.
[01:12:05.075 --> 01:12:10.339]  Like an explosion.
[01:12:10.339 --> 01:12:12.741]  Jane, what more can you tell us about this collapse?
[01:12:12.741 --> 01:12:19.546]  Details are very, very sketchy.
[01:12:19.546 --> 01:12:22.228]  The entire half inch of the beam is gone.
[01:12:23.482 --> 01:12:24.923]  Entirely dissolved.
[01:12:24.923 --> 01:12:37.649]  Something happened to cause the steel to really thin and in some places to disappear entirely.
[01:12:37.649 --> 01:12:42.652]  Building 7 is the first high-rise building in the world that has collapsed solely due to...
[01:12:48.072 --> 01:12:49.093]  There you go, folks.
[01:12:49.093 --> 01:12:50.074]  There it is.
[01:12:50.074 --> 01:12:50.574]  Get ready.
[01:12:50.574 --> 01:12:52.656]  I think it's July 6th, Sunday.
[01:12:52.656 --> 01:12:53.757]  They're going to be playing that.
[01:12:53.757 --> 01:12:57.260]  So, well, I'm going to have to watch it.
[01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:01.104]  And Lord knows it's more than likely going to be a hit piece.
[01:13:01.104 --> 01:13:02.605]  I'll be shocked if it's anything but.
[01:13:02.605 --> 01:13:04.247]  I met the people that were doing it.
[01:13:04.247 --> 01:13:06.729]  They didn't seem to have the truth in mind.
[01:13:08.231 --> 01:13:11.553]  That being said, before we go to callers, I'd like to thank one of our sponsors.
[01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:13.274]  It's what makes this show possible.
[01:13:13.274 --> 01:13:14.095]  Uh, Enterfood.
[01:13:14.095 --> 01:13:19.258]  The more energy your body has to spend getting the fuel it needs, the less it makes available for you to use.
[01:13:19.258 --> 01:13:21.119]  Try giving your body what it really needs.
[01:13:21.119 --> 01:13:23.500]  Super-powered natural food.
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:27.803]  Enterfood is the best nutritional product we've ever tried, and believe me, we've tried them all.
[01:13:27.803 --> 01:13:28.383]  And that's true.
[01:13:28.383 --> 01:13:30.024]  I mean, we do get offers all the time.
[01:13:30.024 --> 01:13:36.908]  In fact, there's a sponsor we're picking up on Monday that I wish I could say right now, because I love their product so much, but, you know, Monday.
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:44.182]  Enerfood is a revolutionary green energy drink with powerful nutrition for better health, energy, and immune system support.
[01:13:44.182 --> 01:13:50.824]  A few ingredients to mention are dulse, kelp, barley grass, wheatgrass, chlorella, and spirulina.
[01:13:50.824 --> 01:13:54.425]  I think there's over 20 power-packed ingredients in all.
[01:13:54.425 --> 01:13:57.466]  Some of the bullet points here that you're going to get out of this food.
[01:13:57.466 --> 01:14:01.527]  Balanced energy all day, greater stamina, weight loss, 20 power-packed ingredients.
[01:14:01.527 --> 01:14:02.468]  Yeah, we already said that.
[01:14:04.281 --> 01:14:18.492]  Greater Mental Clarity, Reduced Food Cravings, Healthy Radiant Skin, Helps Maintain Healthy Cholesterol, Improved Liver Function, Healthy Blood Sugar, Immune System Support, Improved Digestion, Detoxing Effects, and Colon Cleansing.
[01:14:18.492 --> 01:14:20.053]  The number to call is 866-762-9238.
[01:14:20.053 --> 01:14:20.293]  That's 866-762-9238.
[01:14:20.293 --> 01:14:21.054]  Or go to ENERFOOD.COM.
[01:14:21.054 --> 01:14:21.574]  That's ENERFOOD.COM.
[01:14:33.444 --> 01:14:37.287]  Although I did just rant and rave, I gotta tell you, it does give you quite the boost.
[01:14:37.287 --> 01:14:45.472]  And I really, I hate those, like, full throttle drinks, and I can't stand... They're so syrupy, they're rockstar energy drinks, it's gross, man.
[01:14:45.472 --> 01:14:51.056]  But, uh, you know, don't take my word for it, I just... I, uh, I think it's terrible, that stuff.
[01:14:51.056 --> 01:14:56.440]  You know, my brother's addicted to it, he should really get on this stuff, because it really does boost, it doesn't crash you out.
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:57.961]  Enterfood.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:58.382 --> 01:15:01.084]  All right, that being said, let's go to our next caller.
[01:15:01.084 --> 01:15:02.985]  Let's go to Mike in Ohio.
[01:15:02.985 --> 01:15:04.186]  What's up, Mike?
[01:15:04.186 --> 01:15:05.106]  Hey, what's going on, Jason?
[01:15:05.106 --> 01:15:05.647]  How are you?
[01:15:05.647 --> 01:15:06.547]  Good, man.
[01:15:06.547 --> 01:15:16.013]  Hey, I just wanted to bring to everybody's attention a movement that I noticed over last weekend, and I've been waiting for it to come out in the news a little bit, but no one's mentioned it.
[01:15:16.013 --> 01:15:19.676]  Apparently, Clayton Chronicles has been removed off of Google Video.
[01:15:19.676 --> 01:15:20.156]  Oh, really?
[01:15:20.156 --> 01:15:22.257]  I did a search for it, and I cannot find it.
[01:15:22.257 --> 01:15:25.439]  So I went and I contacted a few friends, and I said, hey, can you guys find it?
[01:15:25.439 --> 01:15:26.260]  Nobody can find it.
[01:15:26.673 --> 01:15:31.996]  We can find pieces, parts of it, but the entire movie has been removed off of Google Video.
[01:15:31.996 --> 01:15:43.601]  And I find it, uh, you know, extremely distressing that, whatever, last week, the Bilderberg Group meeting, Hillary was supposedly there, we had a Google there, now all of a sudden, a week later, it's removed off of Google.
[01:15:43.601 --> 01:15:44.521]  Coincidence?
[01:15:44.521 --> 01:15:45.922]  Don't know.
[01:15:45.922 --> 01:15:49.564]  It may be a coincidence, but they don't like those documentaries being up there.
[01:15:49.564 --> 01:15:53.786]  I mean, we've had our movie removed, uh, several times, America, Freedom to Fashion.
[01:15:53.786 --> 01:15:55.226]  Fascism has been removed.
[01:15:55.226 --> 01:15:56.367]  This is what I can tell you how to do.
[01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:58.210]  Learn how to work torrents?
[01:15:58.210 --> 01:16:00.531]  You're going to get a higher quality version of it anyway?
[01:16:00.531 --> 01:16:01.512]  I pulled it off already.
[01:16:01.512 --> 01:16:02.332]  I already pulled it down.
[01:16:02.332 --> 01:16:06.554]  Actually, as soon as I converted over, I was going to throw it back up on my account so everyone can have it.
[01:16:06.554 --> 01:16:08.395]  Yeah, I mean, it's an important documentary.
[01:16:08.395 --> 01:16:11.537]  It exposes the fact that the Clinton family is indeed criminals.
[01:16:11.537 --> 01:16:20.162]  In fact, earlier when I was ranting about the Bush family, I mentioned how after Daddy Bush, the guy who ran Coke for Bush in the 80s, became the president.
[01:16:20.162 --> 01:16:25.665]  Well, that man is Bill Clinton and the Mena, Arkansas scandal, where they were literally shipping in the Coke.
[01:16:26.536 --> 01:16:27.477]  It's unbelievable.
[01:16:27.477 --> 01:16:28.237]  We have drug dealers.
[01:16:28.237 --> 01:16:29.938]  It is absolutely unbelievable.
[01:16:29.938 --> 01:16:37.604]  You know, I have, uh, there was a bunch of Hillary fans at my work and I said, Hey, go Google, you know, Clinton Chronicles and check it out.
[01:16:37.604 --> 01:16:38.845]  They came in the next day.
[01:16:38.845 --> 01:16:40.026]  They were white as a ghost.
[01:16:40.026 --> 01:16:42.227]  They had no idea.
[01:16:42.227 --> 01:16:43.288]  They were just white as a ghost.
[01:16:43.288 --> 01:16:44.849]  They were freaked out about the whole thing.
[01:16:44.849 --> 01:16:46.490]  I was like, Hey, I'm not making it up.
[01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:47.851]  You thought it was giggly funny.
[01:16:47.851 --> 01:16:52.795]  It's not giggly funny to know that your president, you know, was dealing cocaine, a hundred million dollars worth a month.
[01:16:53.191 --> 01:16:54.152]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:16:54.152 --> 01:17:04.539]  It's tough to learn that the people that are running the show that we've worshipped for so long that we joke about because we think they have this upper echelon of sophistication and they're fit to run the country.
[01:17:04.539 --> 01:17:05.900]  No, they're hardcore criminals.
[01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:08.182]  A lot of cases they're occultists and pedophiles.
[01:17:08.182 --> 01:17:10.083]  So, you know, that's a tough one to deal with.
[01:17:10.083 --> 01:17:12.525]  Have them watch Conspiracy of Silence next.
[01:17:12.525 --> 01:17:14.727]  Get them into the Franklin cover-up.
[01:17:14.727 --> 01:17:16.308]  Let's see if they even come into work the next day.
[01:17:16.852 --> 01:17:17.533]  They won't, no.
[01:17:17.533 --> 01:17:18.794]  That would just freak everybody out.
[01:17:18.794 --> 01:17:21.037]  The entire place would think I'm just a madman.
[01:17:21.037 --> 01:17:22.959]  And, oh my God, how can you deal with this?
[01:17:22.959 --> 01:17:23.800]  I don't want to deal with it.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.322]  It gives me too much, too much anxiety.
[01:17:26.322 --> 01:17:26.843]  Yeah, I know.
[01:17:26.843 --> 01:17:27.984]  Well, you know what?
[01:17:27.984 --> 01:17:35.051]  If it gives you this much anxiety to know about it, what happens if it's, you know, what happens, you know, we keep going down the road, we're going down with these people running the show.
[01:17:35.051 --> 01:17:36.333]  What kind of anxiety are you going to have then?
[01:17:36.846 --> 01:17:41.549]  Yeah, it's going to be the anxiety of a jackboot officer kicking in the door and shooting his family.
[01:17:41.549 --> 01:17:44.151]  You know, much like happened in Nazi Germany.
[01:17:44.151 --> 01:17:46.033]  That's what we're headed towards, and I don't care for it.
[01:17:46.033 --> 01:17:47.474]  Thank you for the call, Mike.
[01:17:47.474 --> 01:17:49.115]  Let's jump to the next caller.
[01:17:49.115 --> 01:17:50.736]  Let's go to Greg in New Jersey.
[01:17:50.736 --> 01:17:51.757]  What's on your mind, Greg?
[01:17:51.757 --> 01:17:52.737]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:17:52.737 --> 01:17:58.521]  Well, it looks like the People's Republic of New Jersey has another fantastic legislator on their hands.
[01:17:58.521 --> 01:18:03.084]  It's Assemblywoman Joan Quigley, who's voting for one gun a month.
[01:18:03.084 --> 01:18:06.447]  That's right, one gun a month is now going to... They're trying to make this law in New Jersey.
[01:18:07.143 --> 01:18:07.864]  One gun a month.
[01:18:07.864 --> 01:18:10.426]  Now, what is this supposed to accomplish?
[01:18:10.426 --> 01:18:15.831]  Like, the criminals are going out and getting a multitude of guns at one time, legally.
[01:18:15.831 --> 01:18:17.432]  Well, let me explain something to you.
[01:18:17.432 --> 01:18:22.236]  To get a handgun, and this is for one handgun a month, to get a handgun in New Jersey, you have to be fingerprinted.
[01:18:22.236 --> 01:18:24.638]  You have to go to your local chief of police.
[01:18:24.638 --> 01:18:27.120]  You get investigated by the state police of New Jersey.
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.641]  You get investigated by the FBI.
[01:18:29.662 --> 01:18:39.246]  Your fingerprints get run through the national database of all the fingerprints that the FBI keeps, and then, of course, all the paperwork then goes back to your chief of police.
[01:18:39.246 --> 01:18:45.588]  At that time, you're only allowed to buy—get ready for this—only, whatchamacallit, you get a permit to purchase.
[01:18:46.596 --> 01:18:47.997]  And so it's signed by a chief of police.
[01:18:47.997 --> 01:18:48.897]  He knows who you are.
[01:18:48.897 --> 01:18:51.418]  He has your face, your photograph, your fingerprints.
[01:18:51.418 --> 01:18:54.019]  And so I just want to ask you this.
[01:18:54.019 --> 01:19:00.222]  What person in their right mind would get involved in gun running from New Jersey if they've got all this paperwork on you?
[01:19:00.222 --> 01:19:01.623]  No, it's absolutely ridiculous.
[01:19:01.623 --> 01:19:05.104]  And I think it's even tougher to get a gun in New York State, a handgun anyway.
[01:19:05.104 --> 01:19:06.865]  You need recommendations from local police.
[01:19:06.865 --> 01:19:07.425]  Oh, forget it.
[01:19:07.425 --> 01:19:08.526]  Unless you're a celebrity.
[01:19:08.526 --> 01:19:08.966]  That's correct.
[01:19:09.386 --> 01:19:15.572]  Well, yeah, if you're a celebrity or ex-military or a cop, those are about the only ones that have carry and conceal permits in New York.
[01:19:15.572 --> 01:19:17.254]  So, I mean, not only that, think of it like this, too.
[01:19:17.254 --> 01:19:21.678]  So, if you're a citizen of New Jersey, and they're trying to do the same thing over in Pennsylvania with Governor Rendell.
[01:19:21.678 --> 01:19:28.565]  So, just say, for example, you have a dad or a grandpa or something like that who fought in the war and has a collection.
[01:19:28.565 --> 01:19:30.607]  It could be five, it could be ten, it could be thirty.
[01:19:30.607 --> 01:19:31.628]  My uncle was an armor.
[01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:34.352]  So, he had a lot.
[01:19:34.352 --> 01:19:35.693]  So, basically, what do you do?
[01:19:35.693 --> 01:19:37.736]  Do you have to forfeit your inheritance?
[01:19:37.736 --> 01:19:38.617]  Let's hope not.
[01:19:38.617 --> 01:19:40.360]  Alright, thank you for the call, Greg.
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:42.042]  Yeah, they want your guns.
[01:19:42.042 --> 01:19:42.743]  It's no secret.
[01:19:42.743 --> 01:19:43.704]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:43.704 --> 01:19:44.666]  We'll be back after this.
[01:19:50.703 --> 01:19:53.565]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:19:53.565 --> 01:19:55.106]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:19:55.106 --> 01:19:57.267]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:19:57.267 --> 01:19:59.168]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:19:59.168 --> 01:20:00.649]  The late great USA.
[01:20:00.649 --> 01:20:02.430]  America, freedom to fascism.
[01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:09.454]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[01:20:38.469 --> 01:20:54.436]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:20:54.436 --> 01:21:00.338]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:21:00.338 --> 01:21:01.439]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:21:01.439 --> 01:21:05.441]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:21:06.141 --> 01:21:19.945]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:21:19.945 --> 01:21:25.546]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:21:25.546 --> 01:21:31.368]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[01:21:35.613 --> 01:21:37.655]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:21:37.655 --> 01:21:37.715]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.555 --> 01:21:54.176]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:21:54.176 --> 01:21:59.197]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:21:59.197 --> 01:22:04.658]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:22:04.658 --> 01:22:15.160]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:20.043]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:22:20.043 --> 01:22:22.826]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[01:22:22.826 --> 01:22:26.408]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:38.918]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:22:49.767 --> 01:22:50.607]  Question.
[01:22:50.607 --> 01:22:55.351]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[01:22:55.351 --> 01:22:59.795]  A world economic collapse could come any day.
[01:22:59.795 --> 01:23:00.656]  Question.
[01:23:00.656 --> 01:23:04.199]  Are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[01:23:05.908 --> 01:23:06.669]  Question.
[01:23:06.669 --> 01:23:13.915]  Do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?
[01:23:13.915 --> 01:23:15.577]  Answers.

[01:23:52.782 --> 01:24:21.085]  The preacher man says it's the end of time In the Mississippi River, she's a gold drive The interest is up and the stock market's down And you're only getting mugged if you go downtown I live back in the woods, you see My woman and the kids and the dogs and me
[01:24:21.946 --> 01:24:23.427]  They want your guns.
[01:24:23.427 --> 01:24:24.848]  It's apparent.
[01:24:24.848 --> 01:24:28.470]  They're probably gonna take your antique guns.
[01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:31.932]  They're already making ammunition so it goes bad.
[01:24:31.932 --> 01:24:35.554]  Making it expensive so you can't afford it.
[01:24:35.554 --> 01:24:38.316]  Why is that?
[01:24:38.316 --> 01:24:40.637]  Well, they don't want you to be able to defend yourself.
[01:24:40.637 --> 01:24:44.380]  Think about who was for gun control in the past.
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:48.142]  Mao, Stalin, Hitler.
[01:24:48.142 --> 01:24:49.323]  I mean, come on.
[01:24:49.323 --> 01:24:50.443]  These guys aren't good guys.
[01:24:50.443 --> 01:24:51.624]  I don't care what you try to tell me.
[01:24:52.389 --> 01:24:57.753]  I know there's some Hitler worshippers out there, but God, you are so way off.
[01:24:57.753 --> 01:25:04.997]  Talk about a eugenics-crazed madman that did not care about human life, whoever it was.
[01:25:04.997 --> 01:25:06.838]  That's Hitler.
[01:25:06.838 --> 01:25:07.839]  Nazi super race.
[01:25:07.839 --> 01:25:10.081]  Scary stuff, man.
[01:25:10.081 --> 01:25:12.562]  Alright, let's go to Red in Minnesota.
[01:25:12.562 --> 01:25:13.723]  Red, are you there?
[01:25:13.723 --> 01:25:14.503]  Yeah, I'm here.
[01:25:14.503 --> 01:25:20.708]  First, I'd like to commend you for the great work you've done for the last week, filling in for Alex Jones.
[01:25:20.708 --> 01:25:21.168]  Thank you.
[01:25:21.923 --> 01:25:33.206]  Next thing I want to talk about is, basically, you guys were talking about fingerprints and all these types of surveillance measures.
[01:25:33.206 --> 01:25:39.647]  Well, here in Minnesota, in fact, I'm going to talk about an instance that happened a few months ago to me.
[01:25:39.647 --> 01:25:46.869]  I was at the gas station buying a pack of cigarettes, and he asked for my ID, which is fine.
[01:25:46.869 --> 01:25:48.629]  You know, they always ask for my ID.
[01:25:48.629 --> 01:25:51.350]  They want to know how old I am to make sure I'm legal.
[01:25:51.727 --> 01:25:52.347]  Yeah.
[01:25:52.347 --> 01:25:56.430]  So, I showed them my identification card.
[01:25:56.430 --> 01:26:04.416]  I held it in my hand and basically I put my fingers underneath my birthday so they can see what year I was born.
[01:26:04.416 --> 01:26:13.182]  And I knew that they had been implementing this process where they take your license and swipe it into the computer.
[01:26:13.182 --> 01:26:14.483]  Sure, I get it all the time.
[01:26:14.483 --> 01:26:16.984]  Right, electronic verification.
[01:26:16.984 --> 01:26:20.807]  Well, I specifically asked them not to swipe my card.
[01:26:21.565 --> 01:26:26.287]  And he proceeded to snatch it out of my hand and swipe it anyways.
[01:26:26.287 --> 01:26:30.308]  So now, you know, my information is in their computer.
[01:26:30.308 --> 01:26:38.011]  Well, I went to the same gas station line chain, and I went to a different store, and I said the same thing.
[01:26:38.011 --> 01:26:40.472]  Please don't swipe my identification card.
[01:26:40.472 --> 01:26:41.413]  And what do they do?
[01:26:41.413 --> 01:26:42.633]  Well, we have to.
[01:26:42.633 --> 01:26:45.214]  Well, why do you have to?
[01:26:45.214 --> 01:26:47.235]  It's policy, you know?
[01:26:47.235 --> 01:26:48.655]  Anyways, I was pretty upset with them.
[01:26:50.563 --> 01:26:55.985]  She swiped my card as well, and I basically, you know, asked them how can they do this.
[01:26:55.985 --> 01:26:59.367]  This is basically like, can I have your papers, please?
[01:26:59.367 --> 01:27:11.972]  So, um, basically, she told me that that gas station chain was being sued because the information that they were getting was not just your date of birth.
[01:27:11.972 --> 01:27:18.515]  And here, I've got a whole line of people that are like, oh, just let her swipe it, you know, and everybody's laughing at me because I'm concerned
[01:27:19.028 --> 01:27:26.574]  That they're swiping my license, which has all my personal information, a picture of me on it, um, into this computer.
[01:27:26.574 --> 01:27:27.714]  Well, we're all slaves now.
[01:27:27.714 --> 01:27:35.080]  I mean, I hate to tell you, but I mean, this stuff is only going to get worse, uh, if people don't step up and that's why, you know, again, I'm preaching to people.
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:38.242]  I shouldn't be preaching so much, but you need to become the government.
[01:27:38.242 --> 01:27:39.583]  You don't like that.
[01:27:39.583 --> 01:27:42.325]  Go into your County and, and go against it.
[01:27:42.325 --> 01:27:43.946]  Be like, look, uh, I don't like that.
[01:27:43.946 --> 01:27:45.367]  I don't care for it.
[01:27:45.367 --> 01:27:46.308]  Uh, I'm sick of the, uh,
[01:27:46.775 --> 01:27:48.016]  Electronic identification?
[01:27:48.016 --> 01:27:49.156]  I don't think it's going anywhere.
[01:27:49.156 --> 01:27:55.118]  I mean, again, I can't even get a check cash from a bank with my license when it's from the very same bank.
[01:27:55.118 --> 01:27:59.980]  So again, I guess we should just be thankful that they're not taking our blood yet.
[01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:03.342]  Although, you know, Alex loves to report on the way they're taking your blood.
[01:28:03.342 --> 01:28:04.342]  It stops it.
[01:28:04.342 --> 01:28:07.744]  I've actually seen the mobile vaccinations.
[01:28:07.744 --> 01:28:09.244]  That's pretty sick.
[01:28:09.244 --> 01:28:12.045]  I think that was it was that we are changed Colorado that did that.
[01:28:12.045 --> 01:28:13.486]  I mean, yeah, we're just totally
[01:28:14.238 --> 01:28:15.859]  Complicit and here you go.
[01:28:15.859 --> 01:28:21.062]  Take this and we can't wait for biometrics and most people don't even know what biometrics is.
[01:28:21.062 --> 01:28:21.662]  It's over.
[01:28:21.662 --> 01:28:23.564]  All right, let's go to let's go to Will and Philly.
[01:28:23.564 --> 01:28:24.644]  I thank for the call.
[01:28:24.644 --> 01:28:36.671]  I mean, I hate to say that, but when you look at what happened in Europe, especially in London, I think there that your photograph is taken over 300 times per day by all the CCTV cameras there.
[01:28:36.671 --> 01:28:41.434]  They have the facial recognition cameras and they've admitted it doesn't help whatsoever.
[01:28:41.434 --> 01:28:42.415]  All right, let's go to Will and Philly.
[01:28:42.415 --> 01:28:42.815]  What's up Will?
[01:28:44.887 --> 01:28:47.368]  I told them don't swipe my ID please.
[01:28:47.368 --> 01:28:48.588]  She swiped it.
[01:28:48.588 --> 01:28:50.569]  She was behind a glass counter.
[01:28:50.569 --> 01:28:54.191]  I tried to hold it up to the window and do the same thing this woman said.
[01:28:54.191 --> 01:28:56.171]  It really disheartened me and disturbed me.
[01:28:56.171 --> 01:28:58.632]  Now I'm in the database.
[01:28:58.632 --> 01:28:59.693]  Well, let me just say this.
[01:28:59.693 --> 01:29:01.173]  You got a social security card.
[01:29:01.173 --> 01:29:02.134]  You're in a database.
[01:29:02.134 --> 01:29:03.734]  You got a bank account.
[01:29:03.734 --> 01:29:04.275]  You're in a database.
[01:29:04.275 --> 01:29:05.575]  Yeah, but they know what I purchased.
[01:29:05.575 --> 01:29:06.556]  I understand all this.
[01:29:06.556 --> 01:29:07.436]  No, yeah, sure.
[01:29:07.436 --> 01:29:08.516]  Okay, keep going.
[01:29:08.516 --> 01:29:12.678]  I just want to tell everybody, I just added 24 tracks to my sound clip.
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:14.722]  You can Google Kay's Joints.
[01:29:14.722 --> 01:29:15.883]  One word.
[01:29:15.883 --> 01:29:19.528]  P-A-Y-Z-E-J-O-I-N-T-S.
[01:29:19.528 --> 01:29:20.369]  Alright, man.
[01:29:20.369 --> 01:29:21.791]  Thanks for the call, Will.
[01:29:21.791 --> 01:29:23.813]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:23.813 --> 01:29:24.915]  We'll be back after this.
[01:29:24.915 --> 01:29:27.678]  Remember, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:29:27.678 --> 01:29:30.562]  You can get it at me, Myspace.com, slash Jason Burmess.
[01:29:40.612 --> 01:29:44.543]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:44.543 --> 01:29:47.230]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:50.777 --> 01:30:03.923]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:30:03.923 --> 01:30:12.206]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators
[01:30:12.446 --> 01:30:12.946]  We're good to go.
[01:30:41.909 --> 01:30:44.531]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[01:30:44.531 --> 01:30:50.416]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:30:50.416 --> 01:30:52.718]  This is Steve Shank, J. Michael Stevens Group.
[01:30:52.718 --> 01:30:53.999]  Let's get real.
[01:30:53.999 --> 01:30:55.720]  Flour is already being rationed.
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:31:00.924]  Prices on food are getting so high, warehouses are installing security systems and guards.
[01:31:00.924 --> 01:31:04.087]  You can expect soon to see criminal activity in food.
[01:31:04.807 --> 01:31:12.773]  We're all in a foot race as to whether the food will become so expensive we can't afford it, or there will be no food at any price.
[01:31:12.773 --> 01:31:16.776]  We can't grow enough of our own food, even with genetically altered trash.
[01:31:16.776 --> 01:31:19.759]  It will give you the opportunity to eat perfectly engineered food.
[01:31:20.859 --> 01:31:25.083]  They think God didn't get it right, so Monsanto had to step in.
[01:31:25.083 --> 01:31:28.926]  If you think it's a little bit crazy to put in a supply of food, it's okay.
[01:31:28.926 --> 01:31:30.147]  We won't tell.
[01:31:30.147 --> 01:31:30.507]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:31:30.507 --> 01:31:31.368]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:31.368 --> 01:31:31.608]  That's 800-409-5633.
[01:31:31.608 --> 01:31:32.889]  It may be a little bit crazy.
[01:31:32.889 --> 01:31:33.670]  That's okay.
[01:31:33.670 --> 01:31:36.472]  Because there is no such thing as a little bit dead.
[01:31:50.501 --> 01:31:56.510]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[01:31:56.510 --> 01:32:05.363]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch.
[01:32:05.683 --> 01:32:05.983]  We're good.
[01:32:25.109 --> 01:32:25.509]  I think so.
[01:33:02.957 --> 01:33:04.637]  We're back with the Hot Beats, yo!
[01:33:04.637 --> 01:33:07.818]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:07.818 --> 01:33:08.778]  I'm Jason Burmiss.
[01:33:08.778 --> 01:33:11.178]  I've been with you all week long.
[01:33:11.178 --> 01:33:14.199]  I want to thank you for having me one more time.
[01:33:14.199 --> 01:33:15.639]  I love sitting in for Alex.
[01:33:15.639 --> 01:33:19.220]  I want to thank Alex for allowing me to do so.
[01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:22.801]  And Alex is going to be back for his Sunday program over at KLBJ.
[01:33:22.801 --> 01:33:23.881]  Be sure to tune into that.
[01:33:25.436 --> 01:33:33.381]  Remember, 9-11 Chronicles Truth Rising coming to the InfoWard July 4th in high quality over at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:33.381 --> 01:33:34.381]  Get your membership today.
[01:33:34.381 --> 01:33:38.524]  It's less than 15 cents a day.
[01:33:38.524 --> 01:33:41.446]  And I just want to thank one of our sponsors.
[01:33:41.446 --> 01:33:44.707]  Before we get back to taking your calls, remember we're taking your calls all three hours.
[01:33:44.707 --> 01:33:50.551]  Fourth hour we're going to have Alex with Kucinich and Nader replaying those two monumental interviews.
[01:33:51.365 --> 01:33:55.507]  But I want to remind you about Aloe's Colon and Body Cleanse.
[01:33:55.507 --> 01:34:03.352]  Aloe's is an herbal dietary supplement developed to support healthy bowel function by one of our great sponsors, New Vitality.
[01:34:03.352 --> 01:34:11.597]  Aloe's's all natural ingredients nutritionally support regularity and assist your body in removing accumulated waste.
[01:34:11.597 --> 01:34:17.620]  It takes 30 synergistically balanced natural herbs and enzymes that work together to improve overall health.
[01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:20.622]  Eliminating waste properly is crucial to maintaining a healthy body.
[01:34:21.633 --> 01:34:29.938]  If the foods that we eat go undigested and remain in the internal tract, they may slow the absorption of nutrients and even harm the system.
[01:34:29.938 --> 01:34:38.223]  When the digestive system is clear of impurities, your body is better able to absorb the nutrients from food you eat, supporting regularity, energy, and vitality.
[01:34:38.223 --> 01:34:40.044]  And if you want to give them a call, it's 1-800-569-4056.
[01:34:40.044 --> 01:34:40.444]  That's 1-800-569-4056.
[01:34:40.444 --> 01:34:43.586]  Or you can go to InfoWars.com and click on the big banner.
[01:34:43.586 --> 01:34:43.966]  That's Aloes.
[01:34:51.571 --> 01:34:53.953]  All right, let's jump to our next caller.
[01:34:53.953 --> 01:34:55.294]  It's kind of a hodgepodge today.
[01:34:55.294 --> 01:34:56.956]  Let's go to Doug in Indiana.
[01:34:56.956 --> 01:34:57.737]  What's up, Doug?
[01:34:57.737 --> 01:34:58.397]  Hi, Jason.
[01:34:58.397 --> 01:34:59.298]  How are you today?
[01:34:59.298 --> 01:34:59.718]  Good, man.
[01:34:59.718 --> 01:35:01.900]  Hey, my name is Doug Williams.
[01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:11.308]  I'm the author of the article, FBI Homeland Security Behind Martial Law Exercises in Indianapolis, which was published on InfoWars.com yesterday.
[01:35:11.308 --> 01:35:16.313]  Yep, and I had a caller about that asking about when that was going to take place in Indiana, so maybe you could give an overview.
[01:35:16.806 --> 01:35:18.567]  Well sure, I'd be happy to talk about that.
[01:35:18.567 --> 01:35:25.450]  I also called in because there was some disinformation from a previous caller concerning Posse Comitatus I wanted to correct as well.
[01:35:25.450 --> 01:35:30.273]  Alright, so go over the first one and then we'll get to Posse Comitatus because I'm not 100% clear about that either.
[01:35:30.273 --> 01:35:32.894]  Okay, well the operations actually ended yesterday.
[01:35:32.894 --> 01:35:36.436]  It was a little over two weeks of operations.
[01:35:36.436 --> 01:35:39.297]  They actually scaled those operations back considerably.
[01:35:39.297 --> 01:35:44.320]  Originally the mayor, Greg Ballard, had surrendered 26 sites throughout Indianapolis.
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:54.048]  Most of those sites were either privately owned or owned by the state of Indiana, which is where the violation of posse comitatus comes in.
[01:35:54.048 --> 01:36:08.159]  But I think due to some activism and due to some public awareness, the Marines from the 26th MEU were mostly restricted to Camp Atterbury, also to a facility owned by Raytheon, a well-known defense contractor.
[01:36:08.159 --> 01:36:12.223]  They did conduct one operation at an occupied apartment complex.
[01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:17.694]  Where they had a mock terror cell.
[01:36:17.694 --> 01:36:19.655]  I'm not sure exactly what you would call it.
[01:36:19.655 --> 01:36:20.636]  It was a raid?
[01:36:20.636 --> 01:36:21.016]  Possibly.
[01:36:21.016 --> 01:36:21.616]  It was a raid, yeah.
[01:36:21.616 --> 01:36:24.198]  They spent two days doing an observation.
[01:36:24.198 --> 01:36:28.161]  And then they raided this civilian apartment complex.
[01:36:28.161 --> 01:36:29.382]  Yeah, you know, it's the new freedom.
[01:36:29.382 --> 01:36:32.184]  It's the new domestic takeover drills.
[01:36:32.184 --> 01:36:33.925]  And what would you like to correct on that caller?
[01:36:33.925 --> 01:36:40.130]  Because again, I don't claim to know everything about Posi Comitatus, but I do know that it should keep the military off my streets.
[01:36:40.592 --> 01:36:42.473]  Well, it was some horrible disinformation.
[01:36:42.473 --> 01:36:48.374]  He's tried to connect Posse Comitatus to the Continental Army.
[01:36:48.374 --> 01:36:50.135]  Number one, he's about a century off.
[01:36:50.135 --> 01:36:54.856]  Posse Comitatus is a result of the Civil War and Reconstruction.
[01:36:54.856 --> 01:36:59.337]  I believe it was 1876 when the act was initiated.
[01:36:59.337 --> 01:37:05.179]  There's also some additional misinformation that somehow it does not cover the Navy or the Marines.
[01:37:06.772 --> 01:37:21.318]  In 1876, it only covered the Army, that is correct, but later in 1956, the Air Force was added, and through regulation through the Department of Defense, the Navy, and the Marine Corps were also placed under the Posse Comitatus Act.
[01:37:21.318 --> 01:37:30.523]  So, you know, that needs to be cleared up because there's a lot of info agents out there trying to tell people that somehow the Marines are exempt from this act.
[01:37:30.523 --> 01:37:33.084]  Now, part of the problem that comes in is color of law.
[01:37:34.157 --> 01:37:48.903]  The criminals in charge have been using the color of law to tear down posse comitatus since really since the mid-1980s with the war on drugs using a process they call MOUs or Memorandums of Understanding.
[01:37:48.903 --> 01:38:02.428]  And what this is, this is where the criminals in Washington take their appointed attorney generals and they sit down and they write up basically potions on pieces of paper and they call it law.
[01:38:02.884 --> 01:38:09.367]  And they say because using the military to interdict drugs in the U.S.
[01:38:09.367 --> 01:38:19.111]  is so helpful and it's so fruitful that, you know, we're just going to go ahead and put the posse comitatus aside because we benefit by using the military.
[01:38:19.111 --> 01:38:21.452]  And they call that a memorandum of understanding.
[01:38:21.452 --> 01:38:24.733]  And basically, they just rewrite the laws to suit them.
[01:38:24.733 --> 01:38:26.814]  And they ignore our traditions.
[01:38:26.814 --> 01:38:28.515]  And, you know, I'm also a veteran as well.
[01:38:29.233 --> 01:38:37.056]  And it really upsets me that our military traditions are being ignored, because it's very important for our military not to violate those laws.
[01:38:37.056 --> 01:38:38.836]  It's very important for our traditions.
[01:38:38.836 --> 01:38:41.297]  It's very important for who we are.
[01:38:41.297 --> 01:38:47.799]  I think it's also very important for the American people's safety that we don't violate those laws.
[01:38:47.799 --> 01:38:49.380]  Absolutely, that's what it exists for.
[01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:55.742]  You know, when I was a young paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne, we would be in formation and our officers and our NCOs would tell us
[01:38:56.206 --> 01:39:00.508]  You know, our role was to protect and defend the Constitution.
[01:39:00.508 --> 01:39:06.591]  And we were controlled by civilians, not the other way around.
[01:39:06.591 --> 01:39:12.274]  And we were taught about posse comitatus, and we were taught about the dangers of a military coup.
[01:39:12.274 --> 01:39:15.816]  And that's what made us different from the rest of the world.
[01:39:15.816 --> 01:39:18.097]  That's why these must be defended.
[01:39:18.097 --> 01:39:22.139]  And, you know, I publish on a website called dailynewscaster.com.
[01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:34.517]  And I have a loose confederation of other veterans, senior officers, senior enlisted people, also some active-duty people, and we're very concerned about the direction of this country.
[01:39:34.517 --> 01:39:38.720]  These concerns and these questions are by no means anti-military.
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:44.203]  They are 100% pro-military because it is the military that's leading the charge here.
[01:39:44.203 --> 01:39:46.785]  People need to understand that.
[01:39:46.785 --> 01:39:47.225]  Absolutely.
[01:39:47.225 --> 01:39:48.426]  I thank you for the call, Doug.
[01:39:48.426 --> 01:39:50.307]  That's one of the best callers we've had all week.
[01:39:51.124 --> 01:39:54.446]  And, uh, I hope that, uh, you're involved in Operation Inform the Soldier.
[01:39:54.446 --> 01:39:58.969]  Obviously, you're a former soldier yourself and know a lot of ex-military personnel.
[01:39:58.969 --> 01:40:15.359]  Uh, I think it's very important to educate the next generation of soldier, the generation that is now overseas and will be coming back to, uh, security jobs, to privatize security jobs in most cases, but sometimes into the military when we are violating, uh, positive commentators.
[01:40:15.359 --> 01:40:18.881]  I have no doubt what's going on in Denver is violating positive commentators.
[01:40:18.881 --> 01:40:20.022]  Apaches?
[01:40:20.022 --> 01:40:20.262]  Come on.
[01:40:20.865 --> 01:40:21.506]  Blackhawks?
[01:40:21.506 --> 01:40:22.286]  Come on.
[01:40:22.286 --> 01:40:23.547]  Everybody in black uniforms?
[01:40:23.547 --> 01:40:24.268]  Current military?
[01:40:24.268 --> 01:40:27.031]  Former military?
[01:40:27.031 --> 01:40:28.272]  It can't be good.
[01:40:28.272 --> 01:40:37.420]  And again, if you wanted to know more about those drills in Indiana, I guess he posted the interview over at Infowars.com and it was a two-week drill.
[01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:39.802]  I know that the Denver drills are finishing up today.
[01:40:39.802 --> 01:40:41.684]  Alright, let's go to Troy in Portland.
[01:40:41.684 --> 01:40:43.265]  Troy, are you with us?
[01:40:43.265 --> 01:40:43.906]  Yeah, hey Jason.
[01:40:43.906 --> 01:40:44.827]  Doing a good job.
[01:40:44.827 --> 01:40:45.167]  Thanks, man.
[01:40:46.072 --> 01:40:47.733]  Alright, back to Building 7 here.
[01:40:47.733 --> 01:40:56.778]  I was wondering if you know of any videos that show the south side, the supposed damaged side of Building 7 that are out there.
[01:40:56.778 --> 01:41:00.480]  Yeah, I got a video in Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:03.342]  It's in Final Cut of the back side before the collapse?
[01:41:03.342 --> 01:41:07.364]  Yeah, the guys run into the building from the south face of the building.
[01:41:07.364 --> 01:41:09.325]  It shows some of the damage though?
[01:41:11.744 --> 01:41:15.965]  Yeah, this is, uh, this is, uh, at least one of the towers has gone down.
[01:41:15.965 --> 01:41:22.327]  I'm not sure if both have gone down at this point, but, uh, there's a couple of glass windows that are blown out, couple of glass doors.
[01:41:22.327 --> 01:41:29.189]  This is before whatever caused that fire, uh, was there because these guys run into the south face of the building.
[01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:34.391]  They run through the lobby and then they run up the escalators that have been shut down up to the second floor.
[01:41:34.391 --> 01:41:35.731]  And that's when the video cuts off.
[01:41:36.095 --> 01:41:40.458]  And that's in the portion with Barry Jennings and Michael Hess.
[01:41:40.458 --> 01:41:58.828]  So the idea that 25% of the building was scooped out, again let me say this again, that last gentleman who is on the BBC Conspiracy Files video that I just played, Sandar whatever, he's the guy in charge of the NIST investigation, he's the main investigator, and he told Popular Mechanics 25% of the building was scooped out.
[01:41:58.828 --> 01:41:59.369]  That's 12 stories.
[01:42:00.444 --> 01:42:01.104]  OK.
[01:42:01.104 --> 01:42:05.367]  You can't run into a building that the bottom 12 stories are gone.
[01:42:05.367 --> 01:42:06.068]  All right.
[01:42:06.068 --> 01:42:07.188]  That's what I have to say about that.
[01:42:07.188 --> 01:42:08.289]  I'd love to get more video.
[01:42:08.289 --> 01:42:13.573]  It looks like they're going to actually show that video because that's part of the trailer in the BBC thing.
[01:42:13.573 --> 01:42:19.597]  If you watch that trailer on the Internet, when you see those guys running up the lobby, that's after one of the towers has collapsed.
[01:42:19.597 --> 01:42:19.857]  So again,
[01:42:20.237 --> 01:42:22.739]  Damage from the tower sure there was light damage.
[01:42:22.739 --> 01:42:35.086]  I'm not gonna lie, but there's there's no way that that huge fire that that uh That was kind of engulfing the bag wasn't even really a huge fire It was a huge smokestack, but it looked like it probably was an explosive from inside the building.
[01:42:35.086 --> 01:42:46.613]  That's my guess I mean again You've got a Hess and Jennings talking about explosions inside seven that have nothing to do with the towers collapsing and then FEMA tries to cover that up and
[01:42:47.341 --> 01:42:49.662]  Jennings goes and talks to the 9-11 Commission.
[01:42:49.662 --> 01:42:53.383]  There's no mention of him anywhere in the report or Building 7 whatsoever.
[01:42:53.383 --> 01:42:54.683]  It's a cover-up, dude.
[01:42:54.683 --> 01:42:55.503]  Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[01:42:55.503 --> 01:43:04.846]  But, uh, another question I had was, is there any of our guys that are, you know, structural engineers, maybe some architects that have examined the way this building was built and have put their two cents in?
[01:43:04.846 --> 01:43:05.386]  Oh, yeah.
[01:43:05.386 --> 01:43:09.707]  I mean, Richard Gage is the architect they lead in with, and he's done some great work on it.
[01:43:09.707 --> 01:43:11.728]  We have Gordon Ross in the final cut.
[01:43:11.728 --> 01:43:14.009]  He's done some excellent work on it.
[01:43:14.009 --> 01:43:14.729]  He's an engineer.
[01:43:15.322 --> 01:43:22.007]  And, uh, I mean, if you look at some of the really early work, a lot of people always love to try to say, Oh, there's no architects and engineers on this side.
[01:43:22.007 --> 01:43:22.508]  There's never been.
[01:43:22.508 --> 01:43:24.209]  That's, that's just bull.
[01:43:24.209 --> 01:43:24.889]  Okay.
[01:43:24.889 --> 01:43:29.513]  When, uh, reopen nine 11.org started, that was Jimmy Walters organization.
[01:43:29.513 --> 01:43:36.398]  They put out a nine 11 evidence DVD, which was like this, this big auditorium and a bunch of people spoken.
[01:43:36.398 --> 01:43:42.003]  Uh, Jeff King from MIT and other engineer gave a thorough examination of seven.
[01:43:42.003 --> 01:43:44.224]  So it's out there, the paperwork's out there.
[01:43:44.224 --> 01:43:45.005]  Any other questions, man?
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:46.040]  No, I know.
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:48.883]  That's just what I point my friends to, and this is what they come back at with me.
[01:43:48.883 --> 01:43:55.589]  You know, they say, well, there's all this information out there, you know, like all the garbage in the NIST report.
[01:43:55.589 --> 01:43:57.550]  And they say, well, what about all this stuff?
[01:43:57.550 --> 01:44:00.913]  And it's just hard for me to get them to look into it further.
[01:44:00.913 --> 01:44:01.153]  Sure.
[01:44:01.153 --> 01:44:03.095]  Well, the NIST report on 7 hasn't come out.
[01:44:03.095 --> 01:44:05.077]  It's almost seven years later it's going to come out.
[01:44:05.077 --> 01:44:08.740]  They didn't even look at certain floors because they knew they couldn't look at certain floors.
[01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:09.240]  Check it out.
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:11.362]  I don't think they looked at floors 7 and below.
[01:44:11.707 --> 01:44:18.369]  And then point out to your friends that the other NIST report took, I want to say, five years, almost?
[01:44:18.369 --> 01:44:20.110]  Almost five years.
[01:44:20.110 --> 01:44:22.371]  And it's 10,000 pages.
[01:44:22.371 --> 01:44:28.173]  And in Loose Change Final Cut, we confront John Gross about the fact that they didn't explain the collapses.
[01:44:28.173 --> 01:44:35.096]  They just, quote-unquote, said that fire and damage caused, quote-unquote, collapse initiation and then global collapse.
[01:44:35.096 --> 01:44:38.637]  And they did no calculations to figure out why the rest of the building fell down.
[01:44:39.256 --> 01:44:49.580]  And he just says the video speaks for itself and then he denies the existence of molten metal because he knows if there's molten metal on the scene then their official version doesn't add up.
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:45:01.625]  First of all, their test where they built a floor model and they put it under fire for a longer period of time with hotter fires than were actually at the World Trade Center and the thing didn't collapse.
[01:45:01.625 --> 01:45:03.626]  It just sagged.
[01:45:03.626 --> 01:45:05.707]  And then secondly I would say their test
[01:45:06.283 --> 01:45:07.043]  Are you being serious?
[01:45:07.043 --> 01:45:07.624]  That's what they're doing?
[01:45:30.723 --> 01:45:33.685]  Okay, like, it's absolutely ridiculous.
[01:45:33.685 --> 01:45:42.430]  How do you, how do you compare a shotgun, a shotgun going off right next to a piece of steel to a plane crashing into a building?
[01:45:42.430 --> 01:45:58.581]  I'll never understand it, but you know, the debunkers love to have their little talking points and they like to go to controlled demolition because they've often read these, you know, ridiculously long pieces of propaganda and they'll quote this and that and have no understanding of the real science, but then their science is based on lies.
[01:45:58.581 --> 01:45:59.061]  For instance,
[01:45:59.451 --> 01:46:09.840]  When they say that there were 1,200 degree or 1,100 degree or even 1,600 or 1,800 degree temperatures on the floors of the World Trade Center where the planes impacted.
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:10.941]  No, no there weren't.
[01:46:10.941 --> 01:46:12.663]  It would be absolutely impossible.
[01:46:12.663 --> 01:46:21.410]  We have the firefighters audio saying that they are literally in the collapse zone on the 72nd floor and they can knock the fires out with two lines.
[01:46:21.410 --> 01:46:22.371]  Well guess what?
[01:46:22.371 --> 01:46:24.553]  Human beings cannot stand in
[01:46:24.872 --> 01:46:25.032]  I think?
[01:46:42.705 --> 01:47:03.759]  Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have... Yeah, but then we have...
[01:47:04.159 --> 01:47:20.876]  Okay, when they couldn't win us Stephen Jones challenged that brought it into a lab and showed how it couldn't be aluminum They then switched their position and said that it was batteries I mean these debunkers go to no end to try to lie when they know their official version has been debunked and it means nefarious things and
[01:47:20.896 --> 01:47:21.496]  Jason, what's up man?
[01:47:21.496 --> 01:47:22.157]  I'm alright over here in D.C.
[01:47:22.157 --> 01:47:22.777]  Well, relatively anyway.
[01:47:50.393 --> 01:47:56.697]  Hey, listen, has anybody mentioned to you today Ron Paul appearing on Glenn Beck's show on Headline News last night?
[01:47:56.697 --> 01:47:57.237]  No, nobody.
[01:47:57.237 --> 01:47:58.598]  Why don't you recap it?
[01:47:58.598 --> 01:48:00.839]  Well, not that I seek out that show.
[01:48:00.839 --> 01:48:06.423]  I just happened to be flipping by, and I stopped because I saw Ron Paul being interviewed.
[01:48:06.423 --> 01:48:19.951]  And there was a fill-in host for Glenn Beck, and during the course of the interview, he specifically, the fill-in host, specifically asked Ron Paul about the 9-11 Truth Movement, about the film Endgame, and about the Bilderbergers.
[01:48:20.856 --> 01:48:21.236]  Really?
[01:48:21.236 --> 01:48:28.402]  And I thought it was very interesting that he was taking the discussion in that direction.
[01:48:28.402 --> 01:48:43.453]  And that he was really coming from the perspective of asking, why do people that support the 9-11 Truth Movement or are interested in films like Endgame and The Builder Burgers, such a big supporter of Ron Paul, he couldn't really answer why he wasn't sure.
[01:48:43.453 --> 01:48:44.874]  Which kind of made me feel
[01:48:45.831 --> 01:48:48.954]  I'm a little bit disappointed in Ron Paul, honestly.
[01:49:06.824 --> 01:49:14.566]  Almost circumvented 9-11 and gone after our true globalist masters, which are the international banking cartel, really.
[01:49:14.566 --> 01:49:23.349]  If he was able to do something against the Fed, that is so far beyond 9-11 truth that I think that he was playing it smart.
[01:49:23.349 --> 01:49:24.669]  Am I frustrated a lot?
[01:49:24.669 --> 01:49:25.849]  Sure, man.
[01:49:25.849 --> 01:49:27.410]  I'm frustrated a lot, too.
[01:49:27.410 --> 01:49:32.431]  I think that, obviously, he says a lot less than he knows.
[01:49:32.431 --> 01:49:35.712]  He plays politics some of the time, but he is a politician.
[01:49:35.712 --> 01:49:36.072]  Continue.
[01:49:37.202 --> 01:49:52.050]  Well, I just thought it was interesting that the fill-in host, I don't even know, I've never seen the guy before, but he was so willing to bring up these very specific things, it made me kind of get that jolt of excitement, you know, like, wow!
[01:49:52.050 --> 01:49:55.172]  That's pretty, I mean, I think somebody should go get that.
[01:49:55.172 --> 01:50:02.096]  And maybe you have to find some use for it, because it was pretty blatant that he would take the conversation there.
[01:50:02.096 --> 01:50:04.377]  And the first thing I thought about it, you know, this is heaven.
[01:50:12.283 --> 01:50:14.285]  Listen, there's no doubt that we're having an impact.
[01:50:14.285 --> 01:50:22.094]  It's the mainstream media that is putting this illusion over all of us, even within the movement, that we're marginal, man.
[01:50:22.094 --> 01:50:23.416]  We have great power.
[01:50:23.416 --> 01:50:25.398]  I mean, look how much money we raised for Ron Paul.
[01:50:26.075 --> 01:50:27.816]  They know that we're hip to their tricks.
[01:50:27.816 --> 01:50:32.159]  36% in a Scripps-Howard poll believe 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:50:32.159 --> 01:50:34.180]  84% don't believe the official version.
[01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:35.281]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:35.281 --> 01:50:36.141]  I thank you for the call.
[01:50:36.141 --> 01:50:37.402]  We'll be back after this.
[01:50:37.402 --> 01:50:38.563]  InfoWars.com!
[01:50:50.788 --> 01:50:52.750]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:56.374]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:50:56.374 --> 01:50:58.817]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:50:58.817 --> 01:51:01.861]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:51:01.861 --> 01:51:07.607]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:51:07.607 --> 01:51:11.512]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:51:11.832 --> 01:51:17.034]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[01:51:48.905 --> 01:51:49.666]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:51:50.799 --> 01:51:53.660]  Have you heard about American Free Press?
[01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:55.280]  American Free Press.
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:59.782]  The only national newspaper that endorsed Ron Paul for President.
[01:51:59.782 --> 01:52:01.522]  American Free Press.
[01:52:01.522 --> 01:52:04.503]  Written by patriots, for patriots.
[01:52:04.503 --> 01:52:07.284]  Standing firm for our Constitution.
[01:52:07.284 --> 01:52:10.285]  Standing firm against the New World Order.
[01:52:10.285 --> 01:52:12.545]  Hammering the enemies of freedom.
[01:52:12.545 --> 01:52:14.846]  Exposing the intrigues of the global elite.
[01:52:15.646 --> 01:52:16.187]  I don't know.
[01:52:37.026 --> 01:52:38.707]  It's just like it sounds.
[01:52:38.707 --> 01:52:42.168]  American Free Press, all one word, dot net.
[01:52:42.168 --> 01:52:45.489]  Once again, that's AmericanFreePress.net.
[01:52:45.489 --> 01:52:49.891]  American Free Press, the voice of the Second American Revolution.
[01:52:51.092 --> 01:53:01.839]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints, lack of energy, and weight gain, I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet, but it just seemed so difficult.
[01:53:01.839 --> 01:53:11.666]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter water ionizer from SnyderHealth.com and detox my body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[01:53:11.666 --> 01:53:12.427]  Drinking water?
[01:53:12.927 --> 01:53:14.588]  Now that's something I can handle.
[01:53:14.588 --> 01:53:20.272]  The guys at Snyder Health took the time to explain all of the different options and help me choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[01:53:20.272 --> 01:53:32.379]  I use my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking, and since I've been drinking the water, I have more energy, my joint pains are gone, and I already lost 7 pounds, and my skin looks great!
[01:53:32.379 --> 01:53:35.000]  Give them a call today at 877-356-2508 to find out which ionizer is right for you.

[01:54:02.333 --> 01:54:06.315]  I can't tell you guys out there how huge into Knight Rider I was as a kid.
[01:54:07.970 --> 01:54:13.832]  Hasselhoff and Kit the Car, you bet!
[01:54:13.832 --> 01:54:16.593]  Oh, childhood heroes, I guess.
[01:54:16.593 --> 01:54:21.975]  Well, we have the Ron Paul YouTube clip on Glenn Beck, and to be honest, I've never seen this guest host either.
[01:54:21.975 --> 01:54:24.136]  I usually know my political pundits.
[01:54:24.136 --> 01:54:25.356]  I don't know that one.
[01:54:25.356 --> 01:54:30.478]  We're going to play that in the upcoming third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:30.478 --> 01:54:31.439]  I am Jason Bermas.
[01:54:31.439 --> 01:54:31.919]  I've been your
[01:54:32.844 --> 01:54:35.126]  Your radio host all week long.
[01:54:35.126 --> 01:54:36.326]  Again, I want to thank you for having me.
[01:54:36.326 --> 01:54:41.510]  If you want to get at me, it's MySpace.com slash Jason Bermas, B-E-R-M-A-S.
[01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:49.936]  I want to let people know that on the 4th of July, the 9-11 Chronicles Truth Rising is coming to the InfoWar to PrisonPlanet.tv members first.
[01:54:49.936 --> 01:54:52.678]  And this film's just amazing, folks.
[01:54:52.678 --> 01:54:55.620]  You're going to get it in the highest quality possible.
[01:54:55.620 --> 01:55:02.505]  And what I really, really, really love about this movie is that it is absolutely unlike anything Alex Jones has ever done.
[01:55:03.433 --> 01:55:07.916]  It follows the journey of 9-11 activists throughout the country.
[01:55:07.916 --> 01:55:08.757]  We Are Change.
[01:55:08.757 --> 01:55:11.378]  It goes through the plight of the first responders.
[01:55:11.378 --> 01:55:17.042]  It goes through some major confrontations with the global elite and their minions.
[01:55:17.042 --> 01:55:27.589]  As well as some down-to-earth interviews with people like Jesse Ventura, Rosie O'Donnell, Willie Nelson, Martin Sheen.
[01:55:27.589 --> 01:55:29.631]  Again, this is Richard Gage's in the film.
[01:55:29.631 --> 01:55:31.712]  We're talking Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[01:55:31.712 --> 01:55:32.393]  We're talking Building 7.
[01:55:33.032 --> 01:55:37.033]  You know, all this stuff makes it in, and it's really, it's the next step.
[01:55:37.033 --> 01:55:44.136]  The people out there that saw it at the pre-screenings over at Austin, over at the Alamo Draft House, will tell you.
[01:55:44.136 --> 01:55:46.857]  I mean, you can go on the message boards, go see what people are saying.
[01:55:46.857 --> 01:55:49.237]  I know there's a couple of sneak peeks out there.
[01:55:49.237 --> 01:55:56.880]  Alright, let's take a couple callers before we get to the top of the hour, and then I think in the second segment of the top of the hour, we'll play that Ron Paul, Glenn Beck clip.
[01:55:57.566 --> 01:56:00.248]  Let's go to Mark in Atlanta.
[01:56:00.248 --> 01:56:01.209]  Mark, are you with me?
[01:56:01.209 --> 01:56:04.211]  I'll do it in a second while I switch from speakerphone.
[01:56:04.211 --> 01:56:06.053]  Alright.
[01:56:06.053 --> 01:56:07.354]  There we go.
[01:56:07.354 --> 01:56:08.915]  You can probably hear me better now, right?
[01:56:08.915 --> 01:56:09.336]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:09.336 --> 01:56:10.677]  Oh, okay.
[01:56:10.677 --> 01:56:15.881]  One idea that I fancied, I suggested it, and apparently somebody's gone with it.
[01:56:15.881 --> 01:56:26.970]  DVDs number four delegates dot com is preparing a set of delegates, excuse me, DVDs, a set of four for each delegate
[01:56:27.438 --> 01:56:46.749]  To disabuse them of what they should have been told but weren't about McCain, about how the entire nomination process has been hijacked by the neocons and the flaming liberal media, well not liberal, excuse me, the fascist controlled media, that's what I meant to say.
[01:56:46.749 --> 01:56:50.110]  Did I lose you?
[01:56:50.110 --> 01:56:51.191]  No, you're there, keep going.
[01:56:52.574 --> 01:56:53.534]  Did I lose you?
[01:56:53.534 --> 01:56:56.495]  No, we're going to have to let him go just because he can't hear us, folks.
[01:56:56.495 --> 01:56:57.536]  I'm sorry.
[01:56:57.536 --> 01:57:01.297]  You know, I apologize, Mark, but hopefully people will go check that out.
[01:57:01.297 --> 01:57:03.238]  Let's go to John in Canada.
[01:57:03.238 --> 01:57:05.858]  John, are you with me?
[01:57:05.858 --> 01:57:07.619]  John, what's up?
[01:57:07.619 --> 01:57:08.479]  Yeah.
[01:57:08.479 --> 01:57:09.160]  How you doing, sir?
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:11.140]  Hey, Jason.
[01:57:11.140 --> 01:57:12.321]  Well, you know, how am I doing?
[01:57:12.321 --> 01:57:21.624]  I'm doing OK, but you know, the world's a mess and we're, you know, all our suffering and sorrows are due to the fact that we don't have an ability to communicate freely.
[01:57:21.624 --> 01:57:22.164]  Censorship.
[01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:24.151]  He's a tool of tyranny.
[01:57:24.151 --> 01:57:25.392]  That's what tyranny always is.
[01:57:25.392 --> 01:57:31.955]  It's always an inability for us to freely communicate the facts to allow us to decide for ourselves who's good or evil, for example.
[01:57:31.955 --> 01:57:34.997]  You need evidence to form our conclusions.
[01:57:34.997 --> 01:57:50.366]  Now those that support Bush and soldiers I'm talking about included, you know, they're killing people and between me as a man and them, they lose in debate because they can't stand without any facts.
[01:57:50.366 --> 01:57:52.047]  You know, they're swimming in uncertainty.
[01:57:52.811 --> 01:58:04.500]  And we can help them by letting everybody understand in America, if you accuse somebody of a criminal offense without any evidence, you're an enemy of all free peoples.
[01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:17.750]  Okay, so Bush has given you no evidence, closed in with investigations, and to suggest he's anything but culpable for criminal charges in respect to treason being laid,
[01:58:19.211 --> 01:58:20.312]  Alright, I gotta let you go, Mark.
[01:58:20.312 --> 01:58:21.673]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:21.673 --> 01:58:22.954]  We'll be back after this.
[01:58:22.954 --> 01:58:32.222]  Infowars.com.
[01:58:32.222 --> 01:58:35.484]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:41.169 --> 01:58:42.590]  It is a big idea.
[01:58:42.590 --> 01:58:45.413]  A new world order.
[01:58:45.413 --> 01:58:46.334]  In the near future.
[01:58:47.228 --> 01:58:50.291]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:58:50.291 --> 01:58:53.114]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:58:53.114 --> 01:58:55.897]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:58:55.897 --> 01:58:59.101]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:58:59.101 --> 01:59:06.429]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:59:09.434 --> 01:59:14.898]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:59:14.898 --> 01:59:18.760]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:21.322]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:59:21.322 --> 01:59:22.503]  Most people have no idea.
[01:59:22.503 --> 01:59:23.283]  They're not after money.
[01:59:23.283 --> 01:59:24.544]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:24.544 --> 01:59:25.305]  They're after power.
[01:59:25.305 --> 01:59:26.686]  That's what they're after these years.

[01:59:45.779 --> 01:59:54.526]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:54.526 --> 01:59:56.287]  Government cover-ups.

[02:00:03.613 --> 02:00:07.677]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:10.117 --> 02:00:12.839]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[02:00:12.839 --> 02:00:13.920]  The Alex Jones Show.

[02:00:32.696 --> 02:00:33.957]  Start the download.
[02:00:33.957 --> 02:00:36.719]  Go do your, uh, 4th of July thing.
[02:00:36.719 --> 02:00:37.480]  Little barbecue.
[02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:38.421]  Little family time.
[02:00:39.687 --> 02:00:44.789]  Little good times to reflect on, uh, you know, what life is all about, really.
[02:00:44.789 --> 02:00:49.750]  And you get back, and your movie's downloaded, and boom!
[02:00:49.750 --> 02:00:50.990]  You got the 9-11 Chronicles.
[02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:55.512]  You can watch it on, uh, your DivX DVD player, or, you know, your computer.
[02:00:55.512 --> 02:00:58.613]  Uh, technology's getting all over the place, and you should see the quality.
[02:00:58.613 --> 02:00:59.673]  It's-it's pretty unbelievable.
[02:00:59.673 --> 02:01:05.915]  Alright, we're gonna take a couple more calls, and then we're gonna play this, uh, Ron Paul, uh, CNN clip after this segment.
[02:01:06.545 --> 02:01:09.206]  Let's jump to Renee in North Carolina.
[02:01:09.206 --> 02:01:12.247]  What's up, Renee?
[02:01:12.247 --> 02:01:12.928]  You with us, Renee?
[02:01:12.928 --> 02:01:13.308]  Yes.
[02:01:13.308 --> 02:01:14.888]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:01:14.888 --> 02:01:30.975]  Well, you know, I believe that the professional class is used to control the rest of the classes, and they have to have a way for these people to not really understand what they're doing so they don't feel guilty about it, okay?
[02:01:30.975 --> 02:01:36.197]  And I've noticed in my lifetime, as observing the people in medicine, law, government, and stuff,
[02:01:38.672 --> 02:01:40.292]  This is what they do.
[02:01:40.292 --> 02:01:44.094]  Now the definition of a sociopath is someone who lacks empathy.
[02:01:44.094 --> 02:02:01.101]  But when people move into these professions, if they show too much empathy to the very people they're supposed to care about, they're usually kind of admonished for this and told that they're displaying a lack of professionalism.
[02:02:01.101 --> 02:02:02.121]  They're taught to equate
[02:02:03.846 --> 02:02:09.750]  Being detached and lacking empathy to being a good professional.
[02:02:09.750 --> 02:02:12.232]  You know, we have to expose this.
[02:02:12.232 --> 02:02:18.676]  Because I think a lot of these people, if they actually saw what they were doing, they might stop it.
[02:02:18.676 --> 02:02:29.684]  Because they are the people in the middle of the pyramid who are controlling the lower part of the pyramid in exchange for a little extra power and perks.
[02:02:29.964 --> 02:02:33.005]  Well, I agree, and they're the compartmentalized group that doesn't always know the agenda.
[02:02:33.005 --> 02:02:39.748]  In fact, most cases don't know the agenda, and they live in a nice house, and they're able to afford their luxury automobile and the second car.
[02:02:50.515 --> 02:02:54.557]  Send their kids to college and not give it much thought and take a vacation in the summer.
[02:02:54.557 --> 02:02:56.898]  So, you know, a lot of them are extra blinded.
[02:02:56.898 --> 02:02:58.658]  I totally and completely agree with you.
[02:02:58.658 --> 02:02:59.779]  I thank you for the call.
[02:02:59.779 --> 02:03:01.820]  I mean, let's reach out to them as well.
[02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:05.321]  I have no problem talking to my bosses and handing them DVDs.
[02:03:05.321 --> 02:03:07.322]  And, you know, those are the yuppies.
[02:03:07.322 --> 02:03:11.084]  They think they're part of the elite, but in fact, they're just another mode of control.
[02:03:12.110 --> 02:03:17.512]  When they start to lose the house, when there's a true depression in this country, I think that class is going to be wiped out.
[02:03:17.512 --> 02:03:19.292]  The upper middle class, I think, gone.
[02:03:19.292 --> 02:03:26.495]  I think we're going to see a larger and larger separation of the poor and the haves and the have-nots, I guess.
[02:03:26.495 --> 02:03:35.437]  Not even the poor and the rich, because the rich will just become super rich and the middle class will be further eradicated and we'll just fall into more serfdom.
[02:03:35.437 --> 02:03:36.598]  You know, the new freedom.
[02:03:36.598 --> 02:03:37.558]  Good times.
[02:03:37.558 --> 02:03:39.879]  All right, let's go to Chris in Utah.
[02:03:39.879 --> 02:03:40.699]  Chris, what's happening?
[02:03:41.755 --> 02:03:44.316]  Hey Jason, thanks for taking my call.
[02:03:44.316 --> 02:03:48.439]  I wanted to comment on our Second Amendment rights.
[02:03:48.439 --> 02:03:57.264]  I actually work for a company here that we sell pneumatic air guns, and we send a lot of guns all over the world.
[02:03:57.264 --> 02:04:07.169]  I get a chance to see what kind of preventive measures are made to, you know, customers from buying just, you know, BB and Pelicans.
[02:04:07.169 --> 02:04:10.631]  And the caller earlier called from New Jersey talking about the handguns.
[02:04:11.570 --> 02:04:20.335]  We can't even send any BB or pellet guns to anywhere in New Jersey unless they have a state firearm purchaser license and he told you.
[02:04:20.335 --> 02:04:22.396]  Wow, that is intense.
[02:04:22.396 --> 02:04:24.617]  Unbelievable.
[02:04:24.617 --> 02:04:26.578]  Alright man, I thank you for the call.
[02:04:26.578 --> 02:04:29.440]  I mean, it shows how fascist it is.
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:32.221]  We're going to play Ron Paul on the other side.
[02:04:32.221 --> 02:04:33.162]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:51.325]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[02:04:51.325 --> 02:04:55.451]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[02:04:55.451 --> 02:05:02.280]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with a worse toll taken by antibiotics.
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:05.164]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[02:05:05.544 --> 02:05:14.951]  Oxysilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[02:05:14.951 --> 02:05:19.614]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[02:05:19.614 --> 02:05:22.716]  Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[02:05:22.716 --> 02:05:28.821]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers and more.
[02:05:29.161 --> 02:05:35.550]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with OxySilver.
[02:05:35.550 --> 02:05:37.593]  Order your supply now by calling toll free 1-877-817-9829.
[02:05:37.593 --> 02:05:38.234]  That's 1-877-817-9829.
[02:05:38.234 --> 02:05:38.494]  Do it now!
[02:05:47.185 --> 02:05:50.047]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:05:50.047 --> 02:05:51.608]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:05:51.608 --> 02:05:53.770]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:05:53.770 --> 02:05:55.671]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:05:55.671 --> 02:05:57.152]  The late great USA.
[02:05:57.152 --> 02:05:58.913]  America, freedom to fascism.
[02:05:58.913 --> 02:06:05.958]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[02:06:56.340 --> 02:07:00.521]  Thank you, Don, for making my job so much easier, because your products just make it so simple, right?
[02:07:00.521 --> 02:07:06.303]  To fool around with a lot of exotic things that don't work, we can just put them on cardivite and things start to work almost right away.
[02:07:06.303 --> 02:07:16.347]  I've had dozens and dozens of patients with heart problems who have corrected them, and what it's doing, there's so much garlic in there that has a yeast-killing effect, that yeast is a big problem in the gut.
[02:07:16.527 --> 02:07:16.827]  Thank you!
[02:07:46.874 --> 02:07:52.279]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:52.279 --> 02:07:59.445]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:07:59.445 --> 02:08:03.828]  Alright folks, we're back at the Alex Jones Show and I promised you a little bit of Ron Paul.
[02:08:03.828 --> 02:08:06.430]  We're going to have that coming up in this segment.
[02:08:06.430 --> 02:08:08.172]  I'm also going to play Student Scholars for 9-11 Truth.
[02:08:10.111 --> 02:08:10.753]  John Edwards.
[02:08:10.753 --> 02:08:15.544]  In fact, let's play that clip first because they asked him about the Bilderberg Group and I'm a big fan of student scholars.
[02:08:15.544 --> 02:08:18.651]  There's a story up at Jones Report.
[02:08:18.651 --> 02:08:19.192]  Let's hit it!
[02:08:26.818 --> 02:08:30.120]  I just wanted to know what you were doing out there.
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:33.042]  She lied to me and told me she didn't go.
[02:08:33.042 --> 02:08:34.964]  I figured you might tell me the truth.
[02:08:34.964 --> 02:08:35.304]  I did.
[02:08:35.304 --> 02:08:36.264]  All I did was go.
[02:08:36.264 --> 02:08:38.866]  They had a Republican and a Democrat.
[02:08:38.866 --> 02:08:43.089]  I gave like a 20 minute talk on the presidential election.
[02:08:43.089 --> 02:08:47.112]  You didn't have anything to do with being John Kerry's running mate?
[02:08:47.112 --> 02:08:49.213]  No, because I'm Lenny's running mate.
[02:08:49.213 --> 02:08:49.613]  Okay.
[02:08:49.613 --> 02:08:50.374]  Thanks Senator.
[02:08:50.374 --> 02:08:50.894]  Good luck.
[02:08:50.894 --> 02:08:51.855]  You're welcome.
[02:08:55.233 --> 02:08:56.034]  Well, there you go.
[02:08:56.034 --> 02:08:57.976]  He wasn't his running mate yet.
[02:08:57.976 --> 02:08:58.796]  Okay, John.
[02:08:58.796 --> 02:08:59.877]  Well, at least he gave an answer.
[02:08:59.877 --> 02:09:02.139]  At least he doesn't lie and say he didn't go.
[02:09:02.139 --> 02:09:03.200]  But he's still covering up.
[02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:04.822]  But here we go.
[02:09:04.822 --> 02:09:06.303]  Glenn Beck.
[02:09:06.303 --> 02:09:06.864]  Ron Paul.
[02:09:06.864 --> 02:09:07.745]  Not really Glenn Beck.
[02:09:07.745 --> 02:09:08.625]  Glenn Beck's subbing.
[02:09:08.625 --> 02:09:09.286]  Let's play it up.
[02:09:11.554 --> 02:09:18.318]  Texas Congressman Ron Paul may have ended his campaign for the presidency, but that doesn't mean he's ready to give up the spotlight just yet.
[02:09:18.318 --> 02:09:23.881]  The 70-year-old Texan has raised a bunch of money online, has developed a huge grassroots following.
[02:09:23.881 --> 02:09:33.506]  Paul now says he's shifting gears to concentrate on his Campaign for Liberty, a new effort to help elect libertarian-leaning Republicans to public office around the country.
[02:09:34.066 --> 02:09:38.030]  Joining me now, author of The Revolution, Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:39.031]  Good to see you, Congressman.
[02:09:39.031 --> 02:09:39.451]  Thank you.
[02:09:39.451 --> 02:09:40.552]  Nice to be with you today.
[02:09:40.552 --> 02:09:47.918]  So tell me about this revolution and your concrete efforts to energize these thousands of people who are, you know, big-time Ron Paul supporters.
[02:09:47.918 --> 02:09:52.763]  Well, you know, the primaries have ended and we came up short, but a lot of our supporters didn't want to quit.
[02:09:53.263 --> 02:09:55.964]  So, we organized a new group.
[02:09:55.964 --> 02:09:59.926]  It's called Campaign for Liberty, and it can be found at campaignforliberty.com.
[02:09:59.926 --> 02:10:13.412]  We're going to continue to do exactly what we've been doing, energizing people, getting young people interested, studying the issue, understanding the Federal Reserve System, understanding why those oil prices are high, and talking about these issues.
[02:10:13.412 --> 02:10:19.695]  So, we're very, very active, and we've had a great deal of interest already expressed in our new organization.
[02:10:19.875 --> 02:10:20.815]  Well look, I think it's great.
[02:10:20.815 --> 02:10:26.937]  I spend a lot of time talking to college kids who are looking around going, isn't the government supposed to feed, clothe, house me, and change my diaper for me?
[02:10:26.937 --> 02:10:29.597]  So I love the idea of college kids out fighting for liberty.
[02:10:29.597 --> 02:10:36.599]  My question for you, and I always have this question for all libertarians, I've asked this before, Congressman, what makes you believe that Americans want more liberty?
[02:10:36.599 --> 02:10:42.380]  Don't these Gen Xers and their please take care of me mentality really reflect where sadly America is today?
[02:10:43.180 --> 02:10:45.102]  Well, you know, there's a contest going on.
[02:10:45.102 --> 02:10:54.390]  Those who want to be taken care of by others, and they're using government force to do it, and those of us who say that we should be responsible and take care of ourselves.
[02:10:54.390 --> 02:11:04.399]  A year and a half ago, when I was reluctant to join the presidential race, I was convinced that nobody would listen, nobody cared, we needed another generation, we needed a disaster to wake up people.
[02:11:04.779 --> 02:11:09.923]  But I'll tell you what, in the last year or so, I have been very encouraged by the number of young people.
[02:11:09.923 --> 02:11:15.407]  They come to my office endlessly, talking about self-reliance and responsibility.
[02:11:15.407 --> 02:11:17.509]  So, I am very encouraged.
[02:11:17.509 --> 02:11:18.630]  And I think it's the need.
[02:11:18.630 --> 02:11:20.852]  I think it's the obvious evidence the government doesn't work.
[02:11:21.352 --> 02:11:27.393]  The foreign policy's in shambles, the spending is too high, and the young people know they're getting the bill.
[02:11:27.393 --> 02:11:28.633]  And that's why I think they're waking up.
[02:11:28.633 --> 02:11:30.854]  You know, Congressman Paul, I would love to believe you.
[02:11:30.854 --> 02:11:34.734]  I want to live in an America that's a lot more like the one that you want, self-reliance.
[02:11:34.734 --> 02:11:39.495]  And I see it, for example, in Iowa, where the floods strike and people rush out and they help their neighbors, they help themselves.
[02:11:39.495 --> 02:11:41.736]  But let's face it, a lot of America lives in New Orleans.
[02:11:41.736 --> 02:11:45.076]  People sitting around, flooded, waiting, please come get me.
[02:11:45.076 --> 02:11:49.957]  Can you give me an example of where you see liberty winning in the public debate today here in the United States?
[02:11:50.017 --> 02:11:53.880]  Well, I think we won the argument with New Orleans.
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:55.582]  The government totally failed.
[02:11:55.582 --> 02:11:56.963]  And people are waking up.
[02:11:56.963 --> 02:11:58.724]  They can't depend on the government.
[02:11:58.724 --> 02:12:03.268]  So no, I think it is difficult, and there's a lot of people who think government can bail them out.
[02:12:03.268 --> 02:12:06.731]  But the government's running out of money, resources, and ability
[02:12:07.291 --> 02:12:09.113]  And it's going to end.
[02:12:09.113 --> 02:12:13.457]  I complain about us being in 130 countries and 700 bases.
[02:12:13.457 --> 02:12:14.458]  But that's going to come to an end.
[02:12:14.458 --> 02:12:17.721]  Not because I'm going to persuade everybody, but we're going to run out of money.
[02:12:17.721 --> 02:12:21.504]  We're going to ruin our dollar and we'll have to cut back.
[02:12:21.504 --> 02:12:23.006]  We'll have to live with our means.
[02:12:23.006 --> 02:12:29.692]  But the big decision is whether it's going to be the society you and I would like to have with less government and self-reliance and following the Constitution.
[02:12:30.132 --> 02:12:33.435]  Or whether we're going to accept this notion that the government's going to save us.
[02:12:33.435 --> 02:12:37.860]  Well, obviously the government can't save us, because the government is nobody.
[02:12:37.860 --> 02:12:40.122]  They can't create jobs and they can't create wealth.
[02:12:40.122 --> 02:12:41.924]  And the sooner we wake up, the better.
[02:12:41.924 --> 02:12:45.467]  I want to get to political stories and the presidential race in a second, but one last thing.
[02:12:45.467 --> 02:12:46.908]  You mentioned oil prices.
[02:12:46.908 --> 02:12:51.393]  In your view, it seems to me it's classic libertarian supply and demand.
[02:12:51.393 --> 02:12:53.575]  Am I missing something here on why the price is so high?
[02:12:53.855 --> 02:12:55.857]  Yeah, but there's another addition to that.
[02:12:55.857 --> 02:12:57.678]  There's a supply and demand of energy.
[02:12:57.678 --> 02:12:59.080]  But that is not our problem.
[02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:02.983]  You can get all the oil and gasoline you want at the gas station today.
[02:13:02.983 --> 02:13:06.106]  But the reason there's a problem is the price is too high.
[02:13:06.106 --> 02:13:08.708]  So they don't talk about the supply and demand of dollars.
[02:13:09.188 --> 02:13:15.590]  The supply of dollars is too much, and that's why the gasoline prices are going up.
[02:13:15.590 --> 02:13:23.613]  Also, the foreign policy of our intervention in the Middle East has been a fear factor, and there's danger over there, and that has pushed the prices up.
[02:13:23.613 --> 02:13:27.274]  They're up over $100 since we've invaded Iraq, so that is a factor.
[02:13:27.274 --> 02:13:29.074]  Nobody really wants to talk about that.
[02:13:29.074 --> 02:13:33.876]  But the cost of gasoline is up because the value of the dollar is down.
[02:13:33.916 --> 02:13:37.157]  I want to speak about foreign policy for a second because you and I disagree on foreign policy.
[02:13:37.157 --> 02:13:41.919]  You know, having a looney tune like Saddam Hussein running around threatening his neighbors was never good for gas prices.
[02:13:41.919 --> 02:13:46.820]  You add China and India's demand and the tight supply to a looney tune like Saddam Hussein, you've got a problem.
[02:13:46.820 --> 02:13:49.121]  But I have to ask you this because I think it's a necessary question.
[02:13:49.121 --> 02:13:52.862]  So many of your supporters I meet are also part of the 9-11 truth movement.
[02:13:52.862 --> 02:13:56.764]  You've appeared in a movie, Endgame, that talks about the Bilderbergers, etc.
[02:13:56.764 --> 02:14:01.185]  Why do you think there is such an attraction from that part of the political discourse to your movement?
[02:14:02.216 --> 02:14:15.990]  Well, I'm not sure, and one of the reasons is that, though I don't endorse those concerns, I probably have, you know, encouraged it, ironically, because I haven't accepted the 9-11 investigation.
[02:14:15.990 --> 02:14:16.390]  You haven't?
[02:14:18.152 --> 02:14:22.999]  No, because I think they hid things from us and they didn't want to blame anybody.
[02:14:22.999 --> 02:14:25.122]  Nobody was discovered to be inept.
[02:14:25.122 --> 02:14:30.049]  We spent $40 billion on security and the information was there.
[02:14:30.049 --> 02:14:32.292]  What about the CIA agents that reported 35 or 40 times?
[02:14:33.934 --> 02:14:38.135]  That these individuals were flying airplanes, but learning how to fly airplanes, but not land them.
[02:14:38.135 --> 02:14:40.236]  And we didn't do anything, but nobody was punished.
[02:14:40.236 --> 02:14:42.737]  So there was a lot of ineptness there on that.
[02:14:42.737 --> 02:14:47.018]  And nobody talks about the incentives for people to commit suicide terrorism.
[02:14:47.018 --> 02:14:52.800]  And it's very, very clear that suicide terrorists are not motivated because people are rich or because they're free.
[02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:58.842]  They're motivated mainly and almost wholeheartedly because they are occupied by foreign nations.
[02:14:58.842 --> 02:15:02.403]  And if we don't understand that, we are going to be forever threatened by terrorists.
[02:15:02.724 --> 02:15:07.694]  Well, once again, I disagree with you, but are you saying there's something about the 9-11 attack that we should know but don't?
[02:15:07.694 --> 02:15:08.295]  I thought we know.
[02:15:08.295 --> 02:15:10.300]  19 guys, airplanes slammed into the buildings.
[02:15:10.300 --> 02:15:10.801]  What don't we know?
[02:15:11.952 --> 02:15:13.853]  Well, what we don't know is who was in there.
[02:15:13.853 --> 02:15:20.435]  We had that information buried in all those records that some of these people were stirring around.
[02:15:20.435 --> 02:15:22.215]  We didn't do anything to prevent it.
[02:15:22.215 --> 02:15:24.896]  I mean, we had all this money spent to protect us.
[02:15:24.896 --> 02:15:29.958]  On that day, on 9-11, Seoul, Korea was better protected than Washington, D.C.
[02:15:29.958 --> 02:15:31.018]  and New York City.
[02:15:31.018 --> 02:15:32.038]  So there's something wrong.
[02:15:32.038 --> 02:15:33.819]  We're looking outward, not inward.
[02:15:33.819 --> 02:15:36.900]  We closed down bases in America.
[02:15:37.180 --> 02:15:40.502]  Alright folks, I don't know what's on the other side, but there you have it.
[02:16:04.366 --> 02:16:13.333]  Paul's 9-11 ineptness, at least he brings up the fact that we definitely had prior knowledge in that clip.
[02:16:13.333 --> 02:16:14.914]  Again, we know the percentage.
[02:16:14.914 --> 02:16:20.158]  Actually, 33rd article of impeachment was a failure to act on warnings.
[02:16:20.158 --> 02:16:24.822]  And then 34th was the cover-up aspect of 9-11 and the 9-11 Commission.
[02:16:24.822 --> 02:16:33.208]  He brought up the fact that Dick Cheney and George Bush testified together, not under oath, with no record of their conversation between only two members of the Commission.
[02:16:33.999 --> 02:16:35.659]  All right, let's jump to the next caller.
[02:16:35.659 --> 02:16:37.880]  I think that we are at Joe in Texas.
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:40.380]  Are we at Joe?
[02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:43.141]  You with us, Joe?
[02:16:43.141 --> 02:16:43.621]  All right.
[02:16:43.621 --> 02:16:44.781]  Oh, we have Chris in Florida first.
[02:16:44.781 --> 02:16:45.841]  All right, let's go to Chris.
[02:16:45.841 --> 02:16:46.301]  What's up, Chris?
[02:16:46.301 --> 02:16:47.661]  Hey, Jason.
[02:16:47.661 --> 02:16:51.802]  That was a hard act to follow, Ron Paul, my guy.
[02:16:51.802 --> 02:17:03.284]  What I wanted to call about was, to my horror and amazement, I read on Prison Planet just this morning, Bovertone proposes citywide surveillance system.
[02:17:04.584 --> 02:17:12.246]  This system is going to link the traffic cameras, the public building cameras, and possibly those on private property.
[02:17:12.246 --> 02:17:20.888]  And I figured I'd call in since I live here and it's a very relatively safe town.
[02:17:20.888 --> 02:17:24.909]  Well, did you hear about Miami implementing the use of UAVs with cameras on them recently?
[02:17:26.036 --> 02:17:26.857]  I think I did.
[02:17:26.857 --> 02:17:36.766]  I was born in Miami and I was going to say, if any town, you know, kind of would maybe warrant, you know, this kind of, I mean, this is unbelievable.
[02:17:36.766 --> 02:17:37.687]  No, that is unbelievable.
[02:17:37.687 --> 02:17:40.109]  And Miami is like the drug running town too.
[02:17:40.109 --> 02:17:41.230]  I mean, I've been to Miami.
[02:17:41.230 --> 02:17:45.014]  I'm not a big fan of it, but if there is one town that has a ton of crime,
[02:17:45.407 --> 02:17:45.787]  Absolutely.
[02:17:45.787 --> 02:17:47.108]  And I don't think it's warranted at all.
[02:17:47.108 --> 02:17:49.069]  And next, now I'm ready for it to, you know, this is 1984.
[02:17:49.069 --> 02:17:51.190]  I mean, cameras linked all over the city.
[02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:52.531]  I mean, this is a retirement community with
[02:18:13.641 --> 02:18:17.044]  The other half being a bunch of affluent, you know, people.
[02:18:17.044 --> 02:18:35.775]  We have had some high-profile crimes here, and we just recently, this came on the heels of, and it's mentioned in the article, of a mother and a daughter, I think it was, who were taken from the local mall, driven around, and then murdered.
[02:18:35.775 --> 02:18:39.237]  But, you know, those are the kind of crimes that happen.
[02:18:39.237 --> 02:18:42.599]  You know, they're high-profile crimes that happen
[02:18:43.311 --> 02:18:47.733]  And I think they've used that to institute this.
[02:18:47.733 --> 02:18:48.213]  Absolutely.
[02:18:48.213 --> 02:18:51.154]  I mean, it's always the excuse is they take legitimate criminals.
[02:18:51.154 --> 02:18:53.675]  But the thing is, it never stops crime.
[02:18:53.675 --> 02:18:56.196]  All it does is squelch down on the population.
[02:18:56.196 --> 02:18:57.716]  I thank you for the call, Chris.
[02:18:57.716 --> 02:19:03.078]  And, you know, it's just like nobody wants kids to be abducted except for maybe the elites and some sickos out there.
[02:19:03.078 --> 02:19:10.981]  But they use that to implement the Amber Alert system, you know, where they can have checkpoints and illegal search and seizure and your papers, please.
[02:19:11.738 --> 02:19:19.402]  And they use legitimate crimes and issues in order to implement their police state measures and we're only going to see more of it.
[02:19:19.402 --> 02:19:21.743]  That's why we've got to get out there and fight the system.
[02:19:21.743 --> 02:19:23.544]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:23.544 --> 02:19:26.826]  Find out more over at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:19:26.826 --> 02:19:27.646]  I'm Jason Bermas.

[02:19:29.087 --> 02:19:30.468]  Alex will be back on Sunday.
[02:19:30.468 --> 02:19:32.449]  InfoWars.com.
[02:19:47.532 --> 02:20:00.684]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.

[02:20:38.672 --> 02:20:41.316]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[02:20:41.316 --> 02:20:46.623]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[02:20:47.438 --> 02:20:51.559]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:20:51.559 --> 02:21:04.264]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking a 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:21:04.264 --> 02:21:04.704]  The U.S.
[02:21:04.704 --> 02:21:10.246]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:21:10.686 --> 02:21:13.669]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:21:13.669 --> 02:21:15.850]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[02:21:15.850 --> 02:21:18.833]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[02:21:18.833 --> 02:21:25.278]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[02:21:25.278 --> 02:21:28.701]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[02:21:28.701 --> 02:21:35.046]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.

[02:21:42.689 --> 02:21:44.749]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:44.749 --> 02:21:47.731]  Hemp.

[02:21:50.171 --> 02:21:53.913]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[02:21:53.913 --> 02:21:54.593]  Hemp.
[02:21:54.593 --> 02:21:57.694]  Used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[02:21:57.694 --> 02:21:58.335]  Hemp.
[02:21:58.335 --> 02:22:04.777]  This God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[02:22:05.137 --> 02:22:08.660]  Our Founding Fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[02:22:08.660 --> 02:22:12.863]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[02:22:12.863 --> 02:22:23.932]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids, and nutrients not available in other plants.

[02:22:47.682 --> 02:22:52.204]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:22:52.204 --> 02:22:57.325]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:22:57.325 --> 02:22:58.826]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:22:58.826 --> 02:23:02.427]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:23:25.135 --> 02:23:27.015]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.

[02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:39.603]  Again, that number 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:24:03.965 --> 02:24:06.327]  All right, folks, we're back.
[02:24:06.327 --> 02:24:08.928]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:08.928 --> 02:24:15.212]  We're going to continue to take your calls in just a moment.
[02:24:15.212 --> 02:24:20.496]  Critics demand resignation of UN official who wants probe of 9-11 inside job theories.
[02:24:20.496 --> 02:24:22.777]  That's foxnews.com.
[02:24:22.777 --> 02:24:25.199]  And I believe this is Falk that's getting all in it.
[02:24:25.996 --> 02:24:29.017]  All in a tuss, critics are calling for the resignation of a U.N.
[02:24:29.017 --> 02:24:37.319]  official who publicly supports investigating theories that the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon were an inside job.
[02:24:37.319 --> 02:24:49.343]  Richard Falk, the Special Rapporteur of Human Rights in Palestinian Territories, investigates alleged Israeli violations of human rights law for the U.N.'
[02:24:49.323 --> 02:24:50.343]  's Human Rights Council.
[02:24:51.215 --> 02:25:00.677]  But the former Princeton professor would also like to investigate whether some of the controlled explosions from within destroyed the Twin Towers, he told FoxNews.com.
[02:25:00.677 --> 02:25:03.358]  I do think there are questions that have not been answered.
[02:25:03.358 --> 02:25:12.900]  Questions about the way the buildings collapsed and the failure to heed a variety of signals where the danger was coming.
[02:25:12.900 --> 02:25:14.841]  And of course this one's, who's this from, Bolton?
[02:25:14.841 --> 02:25:15.901]  Yeah, John Bolton.
[02:25:15.901 --> 02:25:17.301]  Pure scumbag.
[02:25:17.301 --> 02:25:20.062]  I think is believes a fruitcake city!
[02:25:20.856 --> 02:25:24.979]  But among many delegations of the U.N., it's probably the conventional wisdom.
[02:25:24.979 --> 02:25:27.481]  So he admits that a lot of people in the U.N.
[02:25:27.481 --> 02:25:28.642]  know it's an inside job.
[02:25:28.642 --> 02:25:30.824]  They just don't have spine like Falk.
[02:25:30.824 --> 02:25:32.145]  So he'll just attack Falk.
[02:25:32.145 --> 02:25:33.346]  That's nice.
[02:25:33.346 --> 02:25:34.847]  Good for him.
[02:25:34.847 --> 02:25:37.449]  Way to attack the one guy going public, Fox News.
[02:25:37.449 --> 02:25:38.771]  Thank you.
[02:25:38.771 --> 02:25:39.431]  John Bolton.
[02:25:39.431 --> 02:25:40.432]  Yeah, there's a big criminal.
[02:25:41.095 --> 02:25:49.361]  I don't even know, why is it that some people within the movement, especially the anti-war movement, want to cow down to these people, want to ask their permission?
[02:25:49.361 --> 02:25:50.542]  Don't ask their permission.
[02:25:50.542 --> 02:25:51.423]  Don't worship them.
[02:25:51.423 --> 02:25:53.625]  They're not your lords.
[02:25:53.625 --> 02:25:55.146]  Wake up!
[02:25:55.146 --> 02:25:57.387]  Same thing with that Richard Clarke fella.
[02:25:57.387 --> 02:26:02.511]  You know, he's on this Building 7 documentary, guaranteeing there was no bombs in Building 7.
[02:26:02.511 --> 02:26:04.573]  It was not a controlled demolition.
[02:26:04.573 --> 02:26:07.615]  Oh, and you're in the position to know, Richard Clarke.
[02:26:07.615 --> 02:26:09.997]  You can't look at that building and look at the evidence and
[02:26:10.441 --> 02:26:14.742]  Come to the logical conclusion, no, you're gonna tow the party line like the scumbag you are.
[02:26:14.742 --> 02:26:18.143]  Yeah, Richard Clarke's a real asset to this movement, please.
[02:26:18.143 --> 02:26:19.484]  Scum.
[02:26:19.484 --> 02:26:22.865]  Total and complete scum.
[02:26:22.865 --> 02:26:25.045]  Alright, now we're gonna go to Joe in Texas.
[02:26:25.045 --> 02:26:26.846]  Joe, are you with me?
[02:26:26.846 --> 02:26:28.186]  Hey Jason, how's it going?
[02:26:28.186 --> 02:26:29.546]  Good, man, what's up?
[02:26:29.546 --> 02:26:33.548]  I'd like to make a suggestion to get Michael Reagan fired.
[02:26:33.548 --> 02:26:34.168]  Sure.
[02:26:34.168 --> 02:26:38.589]  And what I've seen through the websites and the readings of the posts on Infowars.com is
[02:26:39.232 --> 02:26:47.842]  Listings of the affiliates of the stations that carry Michael Reagan's broadcasts, but are there any listings of who their advertisers, sponsors are?
[02:26:47.842 --> 02:26:53.769]  Because a lot of times, you know, athletes will lose sponsorship if they say the wrong thing in public and things like that.
[02:26:53.769 --> 02:26:57.954]  So, if you kind of like cut the revenue off from the bottom and work its way up to the top,
[02:26:59.102 --> 02:27:04.104]  And people like Jim Roberts are going to find themselves out on the street along with Michael Reagan.
[02:27:04.104 --> 02:27:04.964]  It's a great idea.
[02:27:04.964 --> 02:27:12.547]  I would say you'd probably have to listen to, unfortunately, the Michael Reagan Show on a couple different networks or put out an email list on a message board.
[02:27:12.547 --> 02:27:15.988]  The InfoWars message board is probably the way to go on one of those stories.
[02:27:15.988 --> 02:27:18.609]  Find out who they are and massively email them.
[02:27:18.609 --> 02:27:19.290]  I like that.
[02:27:19.290 --> 02:27:20.150]  I like that a lot, Joe.
[02:27:20.717 --> 02:27:24.818]  It also could cause dissent within the Radio America organization.
[02:27:24.818 --> 02:27:32.240]  This is like what Mark Dice is doing out there with the military, where he causes dissent by showing the truth of what's really happening.
[02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:42.003]  If we go to a lower-level people who are out there within the organization, anywhere from the administrative staff on up, they start hating their job.
[02:27:42.003 --> 02:27:43.284]  They start hating their bosses.
[02:27:43.284 --> 02:27:45.384]  They start hating who they're working for.
[02:27:45.384 --> 02:27:47.645]  They start hating Michael Reagan, Jim Roberts.
[02:27:47.645 --> 02:27:50.426]  Who are these guys letting Michael Reagan say these
[02:27:51.412 --> 02:27:56.415]  I'm with you, man.
[02:27:56.415 --> 02:28:06.482]  I mean, I was very encouraged by that caller out of Kentucky today that was a special forces guy that, you know, says, yeah, it's great that we're telling the troops and he's on our side and he's talking to other troops.
[02:28:06.482 --> 02:28:09.264]  It just proves Michael Reagan's case wrong yet again.
[02:28:09.264 --> 02:28:10.424]  I thank you for the call, Joe.
[02:28:10.424 --> 02:28:12.125]  We got loaded phone lines.
[02:28:12.125 --> 02:28:14.487]  Only about 30 more minutes left with you.
[02:28:14.487 --> 02:28:19.630]  Then in the final hour, we're going to replay Alex's interview with Dennis Kucinich and Ralph Nader.
[02:28:19.630 --> 02:28:20.591]  Remember, we loop this.
[02:28:21.251 --> 02:28:35.820]  For a full four hours over at InfoWars.com and for PrisonPlanet.TV subscribers, you not only get Alex's weekly television show, but you get the last hour of the broadcast in TV, and you can check out some of the YouTube clips out there.
[02:28:35.820 --> 02:28:38.522]  If you want to get at me, it's Jason Burmess.
[02:28:38.522 --> 02:28:42.284]  You can Google me or you can go to MySpace.com slash Jason Burmess.
[02:28:42.284 --> 02:28:44.866]  Alright, let's jump over to Perry in Indiana.
[02:28:44.866 --> 02:28:46.227]  Perry, are you with me?
[02:28:46.227 --> 02:28:47.367]  Yeah, right here.
[02:28:47.367 --> 02:28:48.128]  What's on your mind, sir?
[02:28:49.999 --> 02:28:56.347]  I just wanted to let everybody know that we've got a We Are Change group up and running here in Indiana.
[02:28:56.347 --> 02:28:58.750]  We're out spreading the truth around.
[02:28:58.750 --> 02:29:03.055]  We were in downtown Indianapolis this past weekend.
[02:29:03.055 --> 02:29:05.017]  We were spreading the truth of 9-11.
[02:29:08.382 --> 02:29:12.465]  Welcomed pretty warmly and pretty openly by most of the public that we talk to.
[02:29:12.465 --> 02:29:15.467]  Hold it, Perry, because I gotta go to break, but we'll have you over on the other side.
[02:29:15.467 --> 02:29:18.129]  It's great to see more and more people joining We Are Change.
[02:29:18.129 --> 02:29:24.213]  It is the premier organization in my mind, and they have a big part in 9-11 Chronicles Truth Rising.
[02:29:24.213 --> 02:29:26.275]  Coming to PrisonPlanet.tv July 4th.
[02:29:26.275 --> 02:29:27.496]  Infowars.com!
[02:29:37.714 --> 02:29:41.639]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:41.639 --> 02:29:44.302]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:47.472 --> 02:29:53.315]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[02:29:53.315 --> 02:29:58.759]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[02:29:58.759 --> 02:30:04.122]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[02:30:04.122 --> 02:30:10.025]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[02:30:10.025 --> 02:30:12.727]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[02:30:12.967 --> 02:30:16.249]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[02:30:16.249 --> 02:30:20.031]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[02:30:20.031 --> 02:30:24.854]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[02:30:24.854 --> 02:30:25.915]  Do your part.
[02:30:25.915 --> 02:30:28.536]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[02:30:28.536 --> 02:30:37.362]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.

[02:30:44.205 --> 02:30:46.986]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[02:30:46.986 --> 02:30:48.967]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:30:48.967 --> 02:30:52.589]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:30:52.589 --> 02:30:54.410]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:30:55.030 --> 02:30:58.071]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:30:58.071 --> 02:31:03.813]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:31:03.813 --> 02:31:08.054]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:31:08.054 --> 02:31:13.256]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:31:13.256 --> 02:31:16.297]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[02:31:45.124 --> 02:31:45.864]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:48.726 --> 02:31:54.370]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?
[02:31:54.370 --> 02:31:57.012]  At LaysMedInc, the future is here.
[02:31:57.012 --> 02:32:00.674]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology.
[02:32:00.674 --> 02:32:12.102]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can kill skin cancer and breast tumors of any size and many other types of cancer without adverse side effects at our outpatient facility.

[02:32:23.127 --> 02:32:25.388]  LASER technology at its best.
[02:32:25.388 --> 02:32:28.649]  To receive an information packet, call our treatment center at 501-255-0528.
[02:32:28.649 --> 02:32:29.009]  That's 501-255-0528.
[02:32:29.009 --> 02:32:32.270]  Or visit our website at lasmedinc.com.
[02:32:32.270 --> 02:32:34.131]  That's L-A-S-E-M-E-D-I-N-C dot com today.
[02:32:57.585 --> 02:33:00.766]  Alright folks, final half hour of the Alex Jones program.
[02:33:00.766 --> 02:33:07.627]  Remember, well at least live, we are going to be replaying the Dennis Kucinich and Ralph Nader interviews.
[02:33:07.627 --> 02:33:10.828]  Alex will be back on the Sunday program and with you all next week.
[02:33:10.828 --> 02:33:13.829]  I know you guys miss Alex Jones, I miss Alex Jones too.
[02:33:13.829 --> 02:33:15.329]  After all, what am I supposed to listen to?
[02:33:16.721 --> 02:33:20.002]  I guess I have to listen to my terrible voice.
[02:33:20.002 --> 02:33:24.104]  Anyway, we're on the line with Perry in Indiana who has a We Are Change chapter.
[02:33:24.104 --> 02:33:34.787]  Again, if you want to do something, folks, it's as easy as going to WeAreChange.org, getting in touch with Luke Rudowsky, and he will help you with all the materials to form a group in your area.
[02:33:34.787 --> 02:33:36.708]  Go ahead, Perry.
[02:33:36.708 --> 02:33:44.231]  Yeah, we were formed initially by Kentuckiana Change about two weeks ago.
[02:33:45.768 --> 02:33:48.750]  We've already got several websites up and running.
[02:33:48.750 --> 02:33:52.272]  We've got a video posted online already.
[02:33:52.272 --> 02:33:54.133]  We're out trying to make a change.
[02:33:54.133 --> 02:34:01.497]  We're out trying to bring the truth of 9-11 to the masses here in central Indiana, and I think we're doing a pretty good job of it so far.
[02:34:01.497 --> 02:34:04.979]  We've got a good crew of people working with us.
[02:34:04.979 --> 02:34:11.263]  We're working with a few radio stations to get some local interviews going.
[02:34:11.263 --> 02:34:14.625]  We're planning some street actions next month.
[02:34:15.560 --> 02:34:18.363]  We're going to host Alex Jones' new movie.
[02:34:18.363 --> 02:34:22.528]  We're going to host a public showing of that next month.
[02:34:22.528 --> 02:34:31.477]  You know, just to try and raise awareness of 9-11 and government corruption and see if we can't really make a serious change here in Indiana.
[02:34:31.477 --> 02:34:36.483]  Well, Perry, I know that if you believe you can make a change, you can make a change, and the first step has been taken by
[02:34:37.145 --> 02:34:38.526]  You know, forming that organization.
[02:34:38.526 --> 02:34:40.228]  I thank you very much for the call.
[02:34:40.228 --> 02:34:42.069]  See, folks, it's up to us.
[02:34:42.069 --> 02:34:42.990]  We can make a difference.
[02:34:42.990 --> 02:34:45.712]  And this also lets me know that we can make a difference.
[02:34:45.712 --> 02:34:47.694]  This was posted yesterday.
[02:34:47.694 --> 02:34:52.578]  Buzzflash has given their Media Putts of the Week Award to Michael Reagan.
[02:34:52.578 --> 02:34:54.920]  And I guess they're not the only one who's picked up on this.
[02:34:54.920 --> 02:34:58.623]  Randi Rhodes, who does a awfully good radio show over at Air America.
[02:34:58.623 --> 02:35:02.186]  I don't agree with everything, but she talks about a lot of the things we talk about on this program.
[02:35:02.805 --> 02:35:04.987]  And she brought up the Mark Dice situation.
[02:35:04.987 --> 02:35:05.507]  Let's read it.
[02:35:05.507 --> 02:35:15.415]  For reporting that that is an embarrassment to the profession of journalism and for being beholden to corporate paymasters rather than the citizens of America.
[02:35:15.415 --> 02:35:27.946]  Sadly, ironic that we just finished interviewing Rory O'Connor about his new book on right-wing radio hate mongers when we heard murder heard a murderous rant by Michael Reagan played on played and condemned on the Randy Rhoads show.
[02:35:28.579 --> 02:35:44.112]  As we listened to Reagan's audio on Randy's program this week, we were reminded that all of this right-wing talk of killing, hate, and violence is being broadcast on public airwaves and enriching the wealthy purveyors of an on-air demagoguery.
[02:35:44.112 --> 02:35:54.060]  And remember, there are corporations who make a profit from these destructive words, as well as advertisers who support the degrading of the most basic of civilized standards.
[02:35:54.060 --> 02:35:56.261]  That ties in with the caller who wants to go after, uh...
[02:35:58.581 --> 02:36:02.042]  Go after the advertisers, that's the way to go.
[02:36:02.042 --> 02:36:09.523]  We read that just recently, Reagan said that an individual who is writing soldiers about his concerns about 9-11 should be shot.
[02:36:09.523 --> 02:36:12.943]  We ought to find these people who are doing this, take them out, and shoot them.
[02:36:12.943 --> 02:36:13.684]  Really.
[02:36:13.684 --> 02:36:17.224]  You take them out, they're traitors to this country, and shoot them.
[02:36:17.224 --> 02:36:18.544]  You have a problem with that?
[02:36:18.544 --> 02:36:19.485]  Deal with it.
[02:36:19.485 --> 02:36:20.345]  You shoot them.
[02:36:20.345 --> 02:36:24.165]  You call them traitors, and that's what they are, and you shoot them dead.
[02:36:24.165 --> 02:36:25.946]  I'll pay for the bullets.
[02:36:25.946 --> 02:36:27.466]  Right there advocating for our murders.
[02:36:28.117 --> 02:36:29.778]  Thanks, Michael.
[02:36:29.778 --> 02:36:40.084]  How about you take Mark Dice, put him out in the middle of the firing range, time to a post, don't blindfold him, let him rip and have some fun with Mark Dice!
[02:36:40.084 --> 02:36:51.231]  Then a YouTube posting of Michael Reagan's broadcast from a couple of years ago finally got noticed where he made genocidal threats against Muslim babies and mothers because of the Middle Eastern mother naming her child Hezbollah.
[02:36:51.795 --> 02:36:53.957]  You know what I would get for its first birthday?
[02:36:53.957 --> 02:36:57.059]  I would put a grenade up their butts and light it.
[02:36:57.059 --> 02:36:58.259]  Happy birthday!
[02:36:58.259 --> 02:36:59.000]  Bye-bye!
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.121]  Yeah, the murder of babies.
[02:37:01.121 --> 02:37:02.322]  He's a real good guy.
[02:37:02.322 --> 02:37:05.825]  He went on to say, what's wrong with killing the mothers and the babies?
[02:37:05.825 --> 02:37:09.447]  It only gets more macabre and definitely homicidal from there.
[02:37:09.447 --> 02:37:16.752]  Since the radio program was simulcast on cable, you can see Reagan as he is spouting this SS diatribe, and he is smirking for the cameras.
[02:37:17.498 --> 02:37:26.462]  These shock jocks, radio storm troopers of the right, know that outrageous comments get attention and publicity, and ultimately bigger checks for their bank accounts.
[02:37:26.462 --> 02:37:33.066]  But they and their radio company owners and their corporate sponsors are violating fundamental decency.
[02:37:33.066 --> 02:37:44.951]  It is difficult and frustrating to try and fathom how we have arrived at this point in our society when the public airwaves are filled with such vile filth and violent calls for murder, also readily tolerated by the right-wing dial.
[02:37:44.951 --> 02:37:46.112]  Of course they are.
[02:37:46.687 --> 02:37:56.530]  Michael Reagan is not just a buzzflash media player of the week, he is a contemptible human being who puts our nation's integrity and moral standards to shame.
[02:37:56.530 --> 02:37:57.230]  Agreed!
[02:37:57.230 --> 02:37:58.930]  And thanks for the coverage.
[02:37:58.930 --> 02:38:09.653]  Remember, Operation Inform the Soldiers, still in full force, and you can still go to MarkDice.com and get all the info to contact Radio America and the President, Jim Roberts.
[02:38:09.653 --> 02:38:11.154]  Alright!
[02:38:11.154 --> 02:38:12.794]  Let's keep going through these calls.
[02:38:12.794 --> 02:38:15.195]  Let's go to Ian in Canada.
[02:38:15.195 --> 02:38:15.915]  What's happening, Ian?
[02:38:16.685 --> 02:38:18.326]  Thank you, Jason.
[02:38:18.326 --> 02:38:20.687]  I wanted to address something that's been so hard to get through.
[02:38:20.687 --> 02:38:25.750]  I wanted to answer something that Governor Jesse Ventura said a few weeks ago.
[02:38:25.750 --> 02:38:42.640]  But apropos of what you just said about Michael Reagan, you might be interested in an altercation I had with a leading producer in the Canadian television entertainment industry who, over the Christmas holidays at his family's house, had a hissy denial fit about the facts of 9-11.
[02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:45.662]  And through a storm of all sorts of obscenities,
[02:38:46.181 --> 02:38:52.063]  He stopped, looked me straight in the eye, and he said, OK, maybe they did it.
[02:38:52.063 --> 02:38:56.024]  But if they did do it, it's a done deal, and you just gotta live with it.
[02:38:56.024 --> 02:38:59.164]  Now that's typical.
[02:38:59.164 --> 02:39:02.205]  That's a Noam Chomsky response right there.
[02:39:02.205 --> 02:39:07.247]  Ultimately, it doesn't matter, even though our entire foreign and domestic policy is based on it.
[02:39:07.247 --> 02:39:10.327]  And this goes to Jesse Ventura's comment.
[02:39:10.327 --> 02:39:15.869]  I'm on the same page with Governor Ventura on most things, but he said that same-sex marriage was none of his business.
[02:39:16.700 --> 02:39:21.923]  It seems to be that his idea that it's a libertarian position.
[02:39:21.923 --> 02:39:30.388]  But I think one of the reasons they pulled off 9-11 is that they know that the critical thinking skills of the population at large are shot.
[02:39:30.388 --> 02:39:39.113]  Governor Ventura has got to remember that it's not just a special government-approved friendship between two people.
[02:39:39.113 --> 02:39:41.434]  Marriage is a covenant where there are three parties.
[02:39:41.434 --> 02:39:45.096]  Some would say God's the first party and the bride and groom are the second party.
[02:39:45.720 --> 02:39:56.123]  We, you and me, and the family and community are the third party who witness the event and at least are required to recognize by law the integrity and sanctity of the event.
[02:39:56.123 --> 02:40:00.364]  Same-sex marriage is not a civil liberty, it's a civil fraud.
[02:40:00.364 --> 02:40:03.485]  It's like a car battery with two positive terminals.
[02:40:03.485 --> 02:40:06.485]  It looks like a battery, but it's not going to start a car.
[02:40:06.485 --> 02:40:08.326]  And I just think that
[02:40:09.082 --> 02:40:14.044]  I can't understand why people won't think in depth, especially Jesse Ventura.
[02:40:14.044 --> 02:40:20.046]  Alright Ian, I thank you for the call, man, and I gotta tell ya, I feel like we need to prioritize a little bit heavier.
[02:40:20.046 --> 02:40:26.789]  I can understand your frustration on the position of that issue because it is being passed throughout.
[02:40:26.789 --> 02:40:36.933]  Personally, I do like to stay out of people's bedrooms, but obviously you're entitled to your opinion, and we just gave you your soapbox on it, and again, I just can't
[02:40:38.001 --> 02:40:52.689]  You know, I understand why people think that it's demoralizing to the country and they think that our morality is gone and all this other stuff, but I feel like there's just so many other serious issues like torture, domestic wiretapping, end of the loss of liberties.
[02:40:52.689 --> 02:40:58.132]  So, you know, I'm not saying I agree with Ventura on his position, but I'm definitely not going to go out against it.
[02:40:58.132 --> 02:41:00.093]  All right, let's pop to another caller.
[02:41:00.093 --> 02:41:02.134]  Let's go to Francis in Florida.
[02:41:02.134 --> 02:41:03.855]  What's up, Francis?
[02:41:03.855 --> 02:41:04.756]  Hi, can you hear me?
[02:41:04.756 --> 02:41:05.056]  Yes, sir.
[02:41:06.647 --> 02:41:18.535]  I'm not real good with websites or anything of that nature, the old one, but can I ask two questions, or actually ask one, and then make a comment about something else?
[02:41:18.535 --> 02:41:21.016]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:41:21.016 --> 02:41:24.518]  Have you ever heard of this guy Benjamin Fulford?
[02:41:24.518 --> 02:41:29.001]  F-U-L-F-O-R-B-E-N-J-M-E-N-F-U-L-F-O-R-B-E-N-J-M-E-N-F-U-L-F-O-R-B-E-N-J-M-E-N-F-U-L-F-O-R-B-E-N-J-M-E-N-F-U-L-F-O-R-B-E-N-J-M-E-N-F-U-L-F-O-R-B-E-N-J-M-E-N-F-U-L-F-O-R-B
[02:41:36.038 --> 02:41:39.379]  And he got that interview with David Rockefeller recently.
[02:41:39.379 --> 02:41:46.120]  And he did a couple hours on Jones' show, I want to say two or three months ago, that you might be able to find in the archives.
[02:41:46.120 --> 02:41:48.260]  Okay.
[02:41:48.260 --> 02:41:52.561]  Now this is a point I would like to make.
[02:41:52.561 --> 02:41:56.862]  We talk about taking back the country.
[02:41:56.862 --> 02:41:57.542]  Yeah.
[02:41:57.542 --> 02:42:01.522]  But not everyone seems to be on the same page.
[02:42:01.522 --> 02:42:03.403]  Everyone has different issues.
[02:42:03.403 --> 02:42:04.243]  Sure.
[02:42:04.243 --> 02:42:05.043]  Issues such as
[02:42:06.580 --> 02:42:13.685]  The NAFTA highway, and the free trade, and immigration, and so on and so forth.
[02:42:13.685 --> 02:42:16.608]  There's just so many issues.
[02:42:16.608 --> 02:42:23.794]  But no one's confronting the issues with the politicians.
[02:42:23.794 --> 02:42:35.423]  I mean, I write letters through the downsized DC, and I tell them, you know, if you don't want to do this, I'll just get on the bandwagon with everyone else, and we're going to vote you out of there.
[02:42:35.806 --> 02:42:36.827]  We don't like you.
[02:42:36.827 --> 02:42:39.309]  We don't like what you're doing to our country.
[02:42:39.309 --> 02:42:56.683]  But if there was one website, one place, where you can go to every single day and email them the same letter, why don't these two presidential nominees talk about the real issues?
[02:42:57.244 --> 02:42:58.765]  I agree with you, but do you not think that
[02:43:15.342 --> 02:43:20.785]  Congress could put pressure on them to say the people of America want to talk about the issue.
[02:43:34.578 --> 02:43:36.058]  Bob Barr is not that bad.
[02:43:36.058 --> 02:43:39.159]  I like Joe Biden on some things, but not most.
[02:43:39.159 --> 02:43:47.721]  Now, the bottom line is, these people make somewhere between $80,000 and $140,000 a year from their job in Congress.
[02:43:47.721 --> 02:43:54.562]  Now, in order to get elected into Congress, campaigns run anywhere from the hundreds of thousands to the millions of dollars.
[02:43:54.562 --> 02:43:57.803]  Now, they get this money from the special interests, the lobbyists.
[02:43:57.803 --> 02:44:04.004]  The lobbyists are the ones that tell them the talking points, and they're the ones that decide whether they're allowed to talk about an issue
[02:44:04.355 --> 02:44:05.736]  It's a corporatized government.
[02:44:05.736 --> 02:44:07.777]  It's a soft sort of fascism.
[02:44:07.777 --> 02:44:22.823]  Unless we're willing to put good people in there that can live on, you know, that, just the pay from Congress, and they don't care about their privatized businesses, they're not millionaires in their private lives, often billionaires in their private lives, after they play the game for a while.
[02:44:22.823 --> 02:44:24.224]  That's how we take the country back.
[02:44:24.224 --> 02:44:25.785]  I thank you for the call, man.
[02:44:25.785 --> 02:44:28.566]  Let's go to Mitch in California.
[02:44:28.566 --> 02:44:30.747]  What's up, Mitch?
[02:44:30.747 --> 02:44:31.907]  Yeah.
[02:44:31.907 --> 02:44:33.108]  Talking about websites.
[02:44:33.901 --> 02:44:37.102]  I'd like to bring up a good suggestion here.
[02:44:37.102 --> 02:44:39.862]  Why don't we have a trader list?
[02:44:39.862 --> 02:44:41.103]  A trader list?
[02:44:41.103 --> 02:44:41.903]  Yes.
[02:44:41.903 --> 02:45:02.647]  Well, I think that there's a lot of... Every elected official that is against the basics that we're trying to get back, it could start off with just their names, and little by little, if you've got somebody there willing to add what this person recently voted on to make them even a stronger trader, and a list of
[02:45:03.581 --> 02:45:04.901]  Patriots!
[02:45:04.901 --> 02:45:06.982]  People we want to keep in.
[02:45:06.982 --> 02:45:23.087]  Now, if we can get these on a few of the different sites that the Freedom Movement is going to, the one people, and there's a lot of them out there that don't like to search for themselves, oh gee, this guy's running for Senate in my state?
[02:45:23.087 --> 02:45:23.887]  He's a traitor.
[02:45:23.887 --> 02:45:26.608]  Okay, I'm going to vote against him.
[02:45:26.608 --> 02:45:28.009]  And so on.
[02:45:28.009 --> 02:45:30.529]  I mean, let's face it.
[02:45:30.529 --> 02:45:31.650]  In everything, we need leaders.
[02:45:34.044 --> 02:45:35.024]  I agree, but you know what?
[02:45:35.024 --> 02:45:36.965]  We have to become our own leaders, number one.
[02:45:36.965 --> 02:45:40.267]  And number two, there are those types of websites out there.
[02:45:40.267 --> 02:45:43.409]  The problem is, there aren't that many big websites in the Patriot Movement.
[02:45:43.409 --> 02:45:50.033]  Let me tell you, Alex Jones' websites, Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, are as big as they get in the Patriot Movement.
[02:45:50.033 --> 02:45:51.755]  There's nothing that even comes close.
[02:45:51.755 --> 02:45:57.058]  Let me tell you, my small site is about, I would say, anywhere between
[02:45:57.882 --> 02:46:01.704]  25 and 50 times smaller than the traffic that Alex gets.
[02:46:01.704 --> 02:46:03.304]  It's going to take some creative people, man.
[02:46:03.304 --> 02:46:04.525]  I thank you for the call.
[02:46:04.525 --> 02:46:11.628]  It's not going to be overnight, but I think that Ron Paul's campaign for Liberty.com is in the right step.
[02:46:11.628 --> 02:46:17.691]  You know, they're trying to get actual officials elected, and that is the next step in this movement, in my opinion.
[02:46:17.691 --> 02:46:19.312]  Let's go to Josh in California.
[02:46:19.312 --> 02:46:20.432]  What's up, Josh?
[02:46:20.432 --> 02:46:21.733]  Hey, Josh, am I on?
[02:46:21.733 --> 02:46:22.753]  Or, Jason, am I on?
[02:46:22.753 --> 02:46:23.693]  Yeah, you're on.
[02:46:23.693 --> 02:46:24.134]  Oh, cool.
[02:46:24.134 --> 02:46:27.135]  Hey, I just wanted to say you're doing great filling in for Alex.
[02:46:27.523 --> 02:46:28.503]  Thanks man.
[02:46:28.503 --> 02:46:43.908]  And uh, you know, it's, it's difficult when these people like Mike Reagan, you know, who have an actual median to get out and talk to people and spread information, just start spreading all kinds of filth and talking about murdering people on the air.
[02:46:43.908 --> 02:46:43.968]  And
[02:46:46.914 --> 02:46:49.035]  Well, that's why we need to double and triple our efforts, man.
[02:46:49.035 --> 02:46:50.495]  Go to MarkDice.com right now.
[02:46:50.495 --> 02:46:56.518]  You can at least send an email out to Roberts, who is the head of Radio America there.
[02:46:56.518 --> 02:46:58.078]  You can at least call them up.
[02:46:58.078 --> 02:47:02.520]  I gave out the YouTube number if someone wants to download the podcast yesterday.
[02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:03.860]  There are things we can do.
[02:47:03.860 --> 02:47:10.142]  I understand that this guy has a venue that speaks to millions of people in a mainstream way.
[02:47:10.142 --> 02:47:10.843]  You know what I mean?
[02:47:10.843 --> 02:47:11.583]  He obviously
[02:47:12.478 --> 02:47:19.099]  You know, has a voice that's probably bigger than mine, but that doesn't mean that if there's a thousand of my voice out there, we can't beat them.
[02:47:19.099 --> 02:47:20.019]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:47:20.019 --> 02:47:24.820]  You know, there's definitely power in numbers and it's the will of the people, man.
[02:47:24.820 --> 02:47:34.322]  If we have the will to make the change, if we really want to live in what Ron Paul said, a society of responsibility upon ourselves and not upon government, we can make that happen.
[02:47:34.322 --> 02:47:35.622]  Is it going to be easy?
[02:47:35.622 --> 02:47:41.843]  No, but I think the first steps have been taken and we just need to keep pressing on or we're going to succumb to tyranny, brother.
[02:47:42.441 --> 02:47:43.762]  Mm-hmm.
[02:47:43.762 --> 02:47:57.153]  Yeah, I mean, we've got like thousands of people like here in my town that, you know, preach truth and everything, that believe that, you know, 9-11 wasn't investigated properly, and nobody ever gets to hear them.
[02:47:57.153 --> 02:48:07.622]  Well, I mean, you know, when they come out against them in the UN, and especially in this country, you can understand why there aren't more whistleblowers, there aren't more people demanding the truth.
[02:48:07.622 --> 02:48:09.103]  I thank you for the call.
[02:48:09.103 --> 02:48:10.845]  Let's go to Tom in Oklahoma.
[02:48:10.845 --> 02:48:11.365]  What's up, Tom?
[02:48:13.561 --> 02:48:14.242]  You with me, Tom?
[02:48:14.242 --> 02:48:15.102]  Yes, what's up?
[02:48:15.102 --> 02:48:16.824]  Yes, I am.
[02:48:16.824 --> 02:48:22.468]  I just wanted to call and just say that you're doing a great job, and also about this YouTube thing.
[02:48:22.468 --> 02:48:38.280]  It's not just the people that you've mentioned as accounts, and Mark Dyson and certain accounts being deleted from it, but any artist that's in the public eye that speaks out about it, all those videos and the people that put those videos on their accounts are being deleted as well.
[02:48:38.280 --> 02:48:43.244]  Annie DeFranco is one of them, and she speaks out about 9-11 and has a lot of thoughts about it.
[02:48:43.635 --> 02:48:43.975]  Did she?
[02:48:43.975 --> 02:48:44.635]  Does she really?
[02:48:44.635 --> 02:48:45.616]  No kidding?
[02:48:45.616 --> 02:48:45.876]  Yeah.
[02:48:45.876 --> 02:48:48.156]  She's got a college girlfriend that was big into her.
[02:48:48.156 --> 02:48:50.717]  Yeah, she's 44.
[02:48:50.717 --> 02:48:54.338]  And I also wanted to thank you guys for turning me on to Amy Allen.
[02:48:54.338 --> 02:48:55.579]  Oh, cool.
[02:48:55.579 --> 02:49:00.260]  She is a very smart woman, and I'm paying close attention to what she's got going on.
[02:49:01.011 --> 02:49:11.156]  And, you know, we're fighting the fight, and I'm calling Congressman Dan Born and other people and talking about chemtrails and just kind of rattling some cages, but thanks for waking me up.
[02:49:11.156 --> 02:49:11.876]  Man, you guys are terrific.
[02:49:11.876 --> 02:49:12.216]  No problem.
[02:49:12.216 --> 02:49:14.297]  Hey, since you're from Oklahoma, I want to get your take.
[02:49:14.297 --> 02:49:21.340]  We're going to have Charles Key on next week, by the way, people, on this resolution claiming sovereignty.
[02:49:21.340 --> 02:49:28.724]  You know, it's just kind of funny because, you know, anyone I ask that watches the news religiously or, you know, reads the newspaper, the
[02:49:29.485 --> 02:49:33.168]  I haven't heard of it, and the information's just not getting out.
[02:49:33.168 --> 02:49:38.091]  The only way I found out is through you, and it's kind of sad, you know?
[02:49:38.091 --> 02:49:45.316]  And I tell my father, he's in his 70s, and I've tried to wake him up, and, you know, I've even shown him the chemtrails in the sky.
[02:49:45.316 --> 02:49:53.983]  I've shown him Justice for 9-11 videos, and even after seeing the videos, he starts thinking for one day, and the next day, it's back to,
[02:49:54.895 --> 02:49:56.896]  Hey, can you hear me well?
[02:49:56.896 --> 02:49:57.976]  You can hear me ok?
[02:50:15.683 --> 02:50:20.546]  I'm using a hootenjigger so I don't have to irradiate my brain on a cell phone.
[02:50:20.546 --> 02:50:26.549]  I went on hold three times, tried to call yesterday, and every time at 12 minutes I would get dropped.
[02:50:26.549 --> 02:50:31.291]  Well hold over this time because we're about to go to break, but we're going to take some final callers.
[02:50:31.291 --> 02:50:35.133]  Then we're going to replay Alex with Dennis Kucinich and Ralph Nader.
[02:50:35.133 --> 02:50:39.956]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv for the 9-11 Chronicles July 4th.
[02:50:47.648 --> 02:50:49.069]  It is a big idea.
[02:50:49.069 --> 02:50:51.870]  A New World Order.
[02:50:51.870 --> 02:50:56.773]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:50:56.773 --> 02:50:59.615]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:50:59.615 --> 02:51:02.396]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:51:02.396 --> 02:51:05.578]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:51:05.578 --> 02:51:12.902]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:51:15.928 --> 02:51:21.372]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:51:21.372 --> 02:51:25.234]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:51:25.234 --> 02:51:27.796]  Build America is making great progress for the world government.
[02:51:27.796 --> 02:51:28.957]  Most people have no idea.
[02:51:28.957 --> 02:51:29.757]  They're not after money.
[02:51:29.757 --> 02:51:31.038]  They have all the money they need.
[02:51:31.038 --> 02:51:31.639]  They're after power.
[02:51:31.639 --> 02:51:33.160]  That's what they're after these years.
[02:51:33.160 --> 02:51:41.905]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:51:41.905 --> 02:51:44.687]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:51:44.687 --> 02:51:45.748]  You have been warned.
[02:51:46.569 --> 02:51:49.771]  If you're an adult male, you need to listen to this information.
[02:51:49.771 --> 02:51:53.875]  By the age of 60, half of all men have a prostate-related problem.
[02:51:53.875 --> 02:51:58.319]  In the past, many men have turned to saw palmetto to support prostate health.
[02:51:58.319 --> 02:52:00.481]  But now, there's something much better.
[02:52:00.481 --> 02:52:02.142]  It's called beta-prostate.
[02:52:02.142 --> 02:52:07.647]  Beta-prostate contains 3,000 times more healthy plant sterols than ordinary saw palmetto.
[02:52:07.647 --> 02:52:13.572]  In fact, you'd have to take a hundred saw palmetto capsules to get the same benefits of one dose of beta-prostate.
[02:52:13.832 --> 02:52:19.556]  It's guaranteed to provide noticeable support even if you're already having prostate related health issues.

[02:52:46.255 --> 02:52:48.777]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[02:52:48.777 --> 02:52:56.062]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[02:52:56.062 --> 02:53:01.606]  For the last three years, the Earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with us.
[02:53:01.606 --> 02:53:08.470]  In the U.S., commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed, and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[02:53:08.470 --> 02:53:14.915]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[02:53:15.700 --> 02:53:17.281]  Remember our trade deficit?
[02:53:17.281 --> 02:53:22.964]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[02:53:22.964 --> 02:53:29.267]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law.
[02:53:29.267 --> 02:53:30.748]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202.
[02:53:30.748 --> 02:53:30.828]  1-800-453-2202.
[02:53:30.828 --> 02:53:32.049]  Or visit us at www.readyreservefoods.com.
[02:53:32.049 --> 02:53:32.109]  1-800-453-2202.
[02:54:01.137 --> 02:54:05.319]  Alright folks, final live segment of the Alex Jones Show this week.
[02:54:05.319 --> 02:54:08.861]  I'm just honored that Alex would trust me to do so much radio.
[02:54:08.861 --> 02:54:11.762]  I think I did, what did we do, 19 hours of radio this week?
[02:54:11.762 --> 02:54:13.143]  Wow.
[02:54:13.143 --> 02:54:18.205]  And next hour we're going to replay Alex's interviews with Kucinich and Nader.
[02:54:18.205 --> 02:54:23.028]  And Joe, you've gotten cut off the past couple of days, well here's your soapbox now, give it to me.
[02:54:23.720 --> 02:54:24.920]  Thank you, Jason.
[02:54:24.920 --> 02:54:36.024]  First, I have to give a shout-out to the Edwards family and Sharon Elliott, who carry you guys locally on WAIS 770 AM in Southeast Ohio.
[02:54:36.024 --> 02:54:38.105]  Awesome.
[02:54:38.105 --> 02:54:44.487]  And we don't have labels, but we've been passing out a lot of DVDs.
[02:54:44.487 --> 02:54:48.828]  Gotta give kudos to Alex, but I'm glad he's taking a break.
[02:54:49.555 --> 02:54:51.036]  Yeah, no, he deserves a break.
[02:54:51.036 --> 02:54:54.457]  I mean, you can only do this for so long before it really takes a toll on you.
[02:54:54.457 --> 02:55:00.020]  And I gotta tell you what a great job you're doing as far as moving through callers and keeping your priorities.
[02:55:00.020 --> 02:55:01.460]  Oh, thanks, man.
[02:55:01.460 --> 02:55:05.082]  That's very impressive.
[02:55:05.082 --> 02:55:07.723]  I can tell you, I used to be a hemp activist in the 90s.
[02:55:07.723 --> 02:55:09.724]  I'm about 10 years older than Alex.
[02:55:09.724 --> 02:55:10.905]  I'm guessing you're younger.
[02:55:10.905 --> 02:55:12.045]  Yeah, I'm a little bit younger.
[02:55:12.045 --> 02:55:13.646]  I'm only like five years younger than Alex.
[02:55:13.646 --> 02:55:15.747]  Right, and I'm about 10 years older.
[02:55:16.311 --> 02:55:19.872]  But it was in my early thirties that I realized, you know, I was a hemp activist.
[02:55:19.872 --> 02:55:26.855]  I traveled to every state east of the Rockies preaching hemp, thinking that that was the government's Achilles heel.
[02:55:26.855 --> 02:55:31.317]  You know, if I could just tell people the truth, you know what?
[02:55:31.317 --> 02:55:33.898]  People are scared of the truth.
[02:55:33.898 --> 02:55:40.860]  And so we need to keep our focus, which is why I recently joined the ACLU.
[02:55:40.860 --> 02:55:43.561]  And I don't agree with everything they do either.
[02:55:43.561 --> 02:55:44.962]  But they're about the Constitution.
[02:55:45.968 --> 02:55:57.110]  Uh, I would encourage everyone to call their local, you know, their, uh, federal representatives to sign on to, uh, Dennis Kucinich's impeachment thing.
[02:55:57.110 --> 02:55:57.690]  Absolutely.
[02:55:57.690 --> 02:55:59.631]  They should sign that resolution.
[02:55:59.631 --> 02:56:00.931]  And, uh, Joe, I thank you for the call.
[02:56:00.931 --> 02:56:02.211]  I'm getting a lot of static in the back.
[02:56:02.211 --> 02:56:04.712]  I hope you go out and call him next time I'm in there.
[02:56:04.712 --> 02:56:09.092]  But yeah, man, I mean, we can affect change.
[02:56:09.092 --> 02:56:10.153]  It's just on what level?
[02:56:10.153 --> 02:56:12.013]  I mean, if you don't want to make the phone call, write a letter.
[02:56:13.172 --> 02:56:20.037]  If you're sick of writing letters and making phone calls because they're not having the right effect, well, then maybe you should join someone's campaign and help support them that way.
[02:56:20.037 --> 02:56:22.699]  Go to the office 10 or 15 hours a week.
[02:56:22.699 --> 02:56:28.803]  If you want to make the real big decision and you said you've had enough, run for office.
[02:56:28.803 --> 02:56:30.985]  All right, let's jump to John in Missouri.
[02:56:30.985 --> 02:56:33.707]  John, what's up?
[02:56:33.707 --> 02:56:34.627]  Yeah, Jason?
[02:56:34.627 --> 02:56:35.548]  Yes.
[02:56:35.548 --> 02:56:38.130]  Yeah, it's a pleasure talking to such a great patriot.
[02:56:38.130 --> 02:56:38.710]  All right.
[02:56:38.710 --> 02:56:39.931]  Thanks, brother.
[02:56:39.931 --> 02:56:40.972]  Um, listen, um,
[02:56:41.525 --> 02:56:46.729]  I hate to be a bearer of bad news, but I think we're past the point of no return.
[02:56:46.729 --> 02:56:47.409]  Well, you know what?
[02:56:47.409 --> 02:56:48.630]  A lot of people tell me that.
[02:56:48.630 --> 02:56:50.031]  I get that every day, actually.
[02:56:50.031 --> 02:56:50.951]  Let's be honest.
[02:56:50.951 --> 02:56:55.575]  I get emails like that every day, even talking to some people in the office.
[02:56:55.575 --> 02:56:59.858]  If that's the case, I'm still not going to live on my knees.
[02:56:59.858 --> 02:57:02.980]  I'd rather die on my feet, so I'm going to go down swinging, brother.
[02:57:02.980 --> 02:57:04.301]  I hear you.
[02:57:04.301 --> 02:57:04.721]  I hear you.
[02:57:09.618 --> 02:57:28.811]  You know, it's a shame that we don't, you know, somebody was telling me that when Reagan was President, he had talked to some military people and was wanting to get things changed, and half of them, you know, there was some military that wanted to and some of them didn't, and I guess the ones that wanted to backed out.
[02:57:28.811 --> 02:57:33.033]  You know, it's really a shame that there's somebody in the Pentagon that don't have the guts
[02:57:41.779 --> 02:57:44.860]  We're past the point of talking, man.
[02:57:44.860 --> 02:57:57.283]  I believe in voting and running for it and everything, but pretty soon you won't be able to listen to nothing over the air.
[02:57:57.283 --> 02:57:59.984]  You won't know what's really going on.
[02:57:59.984 --> 02:58:03.725]  It'll be by word of mouth and people will wish they had done something.
[02:58:04.187 --> 02:58:06.308]  I agree, man, and we are going into that.
[02:58:06.308 --> 02:58:08.128]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:58:08.128 --> 02:58:10.949]  Next hour, Alex interviews Dennis Kucinich and Ralph Nader.
[02:58:10.949 --> 02:58:14.711]  The entire four hours will be rebroadcast at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:14.711 --> 02:58:19.792]  And let's not forget, 9-11 Chronicles Truth Rising, a new epic Jones production.

[02:58:21.013 --> 02:58:23.013]  Available to the InfoWars July 4th.
[02:58:23.013 --> 02:58:24.354]  Thanks for listening.

[02:58:47.767 --> 02:58:49.548]  America, freedom to fascism.

[02:59:55.137 --> 02:59:56.698]  Well, so does he.
[02:59:56.698 --> 03:00:00.879]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:00.879 --> 03:00:10.822]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:10.822 --> 03:00:18.264]  Well, for the next 20 minutes, we have presidential candidate running as an independent, not as a Green this time, Ralph Nader.
[03:00:19.685 --> 03:00:26.465]  Famous anti-corruption consumer advocate and he is with us now running for president.
[03:00:26.465 --> 03:00:27.728]  The Democrats could argue...
[03:00:28.650 --> 03:00:35.115]  That, you know, it was bad for him to run as a Green and maybe it made Al Gore lose, or this or that, or some other candidate.
[03:00:35.115 --> 03:00:40.540]  But in the final equation now, what difference is there with Barack Obama and John McCain?
[03:00:40.540 --> 03:00:48.006]  And we'll ask Ralph Nader his take on that, talk about his campaign and what his party platform is running as an Independent.
[03:00:48.006 --> 03:00:50.468]  Mr. Nader, thank you for spending time with us.
[03:00:50.468 --> 03:00:51.149]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:00:51.149 --> 03:00:52.910]  Thank you, listeners.
[03:00:52.910 --> 03:00:56.373]  What's most important for my listeners to know, and why are you running for President?
[03:00:57.774 --> 03:01:04.579]  Well, we need someone who has stood for the people and not for big business and their government minions in Washington.
[03:01:04.579 --> 03:01:10.984]  And it's quite clear, after working here for so many years, that every department agency in Washington, D.C.
[03:01:10.984 --> 03:01:13.526]  is overwhelmingly controlled by corporate power.
[03:01:13.526 --> 03:01:18.130]  The big banks and financial institutions control the Department of Treasury and the Federal Reserve.
[03:01:18.130 --> 03:01:22.994]  The big defense manufacturers control the Department of Defense more than the people.
[03:01:23.653 --> 03:01:26.635]  There's not much left for people to decide anymore, Alec.
[03:01:26.635 --> 03:01:28.035]  Not much left at all.
[03:01:28.035 --> 03:01:35.739]  The Constitution still starts with we the people, but the way the judges are reading it, it sounds more like we the corporation.
[03:01:35.739 --> 03:01:43.342]  So on our website, votenator.org, and I really urge you to connect with that vibrant website from time to time, folks.
[03:01:43.342 --> 03:01:51.626]  And also, regardless of where you're going to vote or who you're going to vote for, log into our email at votenator.org and you'll get regular
[03:01:52.368 --> 03:01:54.169]  Uh, missives and announcements.
[03:01:54.169 --> 03:02:00.070]  It gives you a different take than the mainstream media does on the presidential campaign.
[03:02:00.070 --> 03:02:04.351]  Sir, the decision... The thing is this.
[03:02:04.351 --> 03:02:11.393]  People who believe the taxpayer dollar is a sacred trust have got to challenge the waste in Washington.
[03:02:11.393 --> 03:02:19.875]  And the biggest waste is in that bloated, wasteful military budget that now takes one half of the federal government's complete operating expenditures.
[03:02:19.875 --> 03:02:21.055]  And there's no more Soviet Union.
[03:02:21.607 --> 03:02:35.756]  So it's obviously a huge contract bonanza for these big defense companies whose lobbies swarm over Washington, whose political action committees cash register politics, and whose executives go into the Pentagon
[03:02:36.761 --> 03:02:40.643]  Telling generals and admirals what they can do at the top.
[03:02:40.643 --> 03:02:51.730]  Mr. Nader, I want to go back to what you first said, describing how global corporations have come in and taken over the decision-making process of government to where government is just their vehicle.
[03:02:51.730 --> 03:02:53.871]  How would you describe that system?
[03:02:53.871 --> 03:02:55.111]  Is that fascism?
[03:02:55.111 --> 03:02:59.794]  Yeah, well, Franklin Delano Roosevelt said it in 1938 in a message to Congress.
[03:02:59.794 --> 03:03:03.216]  He said, when our government is taken over by private economic power,
[03:03:03.636 --> 03:03:04.456]  That's fascism.
[03:03:04.456 --> 03:03:06.777]  He used that exact words, Alex.
[03:03:06.777 --> 03:03:09.637]  And of course, it's never been worse.
[03:03:09.637 --> 03:03:12.158]  What do you hope to do with this campaign?
[03:03:12.158 --> 03:03:13.738]  Well, look what we've got to do.
[03:03:13.738 --> 03:03:17.379]  First of all, these global trade agreements are more than trade agreements.
[03:03:17.379 --> 03:03:28.121]  They basically allow communists and fascist dictators abroad who receive the global corporation's jobs and industries and pummel their workers down to 20, 30, 40 cents an hour, etc.
[03:03:30.222 --> 03:03:36.466]  They allow these fascist and communist regimes to pull down the standard of living for the American worker.
[03:03:36.466 --> 03:03:39.848]  That's what the whole point of NAFTA and WTO are.
[03:03:39.848 --> 03:03:46.833]  It's to open up very low-cost areas abroad, and these are dictatorially repressed costs.
[03:03:46.833 --> 03:03:50.295]  They are not market costs in places like China.
[03:03:50.956 --> 03:03:54.479]  And so they say, OK, we're open for business.
[03:03:54.479 --> 03:04:09.851]  So, you know, General Electric, General Motors, all these companies move their industries, lay off their workers, hollow communities in downtown USA, around the country, the electronics industry, the auto supply industry, you know, they're all moving over there.
[03:04:09.851 --> 03:04:17.818]  And then they use this hardworking Chinese labor at 30, 40, 50 cents an hour with modern capital equipment, ship the products back to the U.S.
[03:04:18.431 --> 03:04:24.875]  And in the meantime, workers and companies playing by the rules here can't compete.
[03:04:24.875 --> 03:04:31.718]  And not only that, but a lot of the food you're getting, especially farm-bred fish, for example, from China, is contaminated.
[03:04:31.718 --> 03:04:37.301]  The blood thinner, heparin, has just been documented to 120 deaths in America.
[03:04:37.301 --> 03:04:38.042]  Mr. Nader.
[03:04:38.042 --> 03:04:40.023]  We've got to turn this right around.
[03:04:40.783 --> 03:04:41.083]  Yes, sir.
[03:04:41.083 --> 03:04:41.604]  Got a break.
[03:04:41.604 --> 03:04:42.064]  Got a break.
[03:04:42.064 --> 03:04:44.285]  Uh, we're going to continue talking on the internets.

[03:04:57.413 --> 03:05:08.482]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[03:05:08.482 --> 03:05:11.905]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[03:05:11.905 --> 03:05:13.666]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[03:05:13.666 --> 03:05:17.769]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film

[03:06:23.514 --> 03:06:26.737]  Decide, it's food now or probably never.
[03:06:26.737 --> 03:06:28.699]  But can you afford to be wrong?
[03:06:28.699 --> 03:06:29.880]  Decide now.

[03:06:45.543 --> 03:06:51.626]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[03:06:51.626 --> 03:06:57.568]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[03:06:57.568 --> 03:07:01.730]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[03:07:01.730 --> 03:07:06.632]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[03:07:06.892 --> 03:07:15.379]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[03:07:44.588 --> 03:07:49.993]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:49.993 --> 03:07:53.276]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:07:53.276 --> 03:07:57.199]  The PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and listeners of the InfoWars.com streams.
[03:07:57.199 --> 03:08:00.141]  We've just got a behind-the-scenes for three minutes with Ralph Nader.
[03:08:00.141 --> 03:08:02.964]  This is our main final segment with him for the next 15 minutes.
[03:08:02.964 --> 03:08:07.368]  Right now, Sir Dennis Kucinich, who I know you agree with on a lot of policies,
[03:08:08.208 --> 03:08:12.272]  Well, not only am I supportive, but about three weeks ago I stood in front of the White House with the tourists milling around
[03:08:34.065 --> 03:08:34.326]  I think.
[03:08:51.804 --> 03:08:59.487]  One is a criminal war of aggression against Iraq based on a platform of lies, deceptions, and cover-ups that have been hugely documented.
[03:08:59.487 --> 03:09:02.748]  The second is systemic torture that violates the U.S.
[03:09:02.748 --> 03:09:07.150]  Army Field Manual, federal statutes, our Constitution, and the Geneva Conventions.
[03:09:07.150 --> 03:09:15.793]  The third is arresting thousands of Americans and throwing them in jail without preferring charges and allowing them to have attorneys.
[03:09:19.983 --> 03:09:33.006]  His spying on thousands of Americans, which Bush has admitted more than once, without a judicial warrant, that's a five-year jail term, first-class felony under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
[03:09:33.006 --> 03:09:46.950]  And the fifth is this outlaw president, this King George IV, has had 800 signing statements, signing bills enacted by Congress, and he basically says, I'll decide whether or not I'm going to obey them.
[03:09:47.409 --> 03:09:52.972]  And that's more signing statements than all the presidents from George Washington to Clinton put together.
[03:09:52.972 --> 03:10:04.739]  So all five, and they go on every day, they're not like Alex, not like, you know, a one-time Watergate situation, not like lying under oath about sex involving Clinton, for which he was impeached.
[03:10:04.739 --> 03:10:07.421]  And I think we should all support Dennis Kucinich.
[03:10:07.421 --> 03:10:15.065]  You notice that the mainstream media has pretty much blacked him out, and here he is, an upstanding member of the House, right on the House floor.
[03:10:15.649 --> 03:10:20.814]  And they've got reporters all over the place, and suddenly they put away their pens, huh?
[03:10:20.814 --> 03:10:32.283]  So it is important to get Chairman John Conyers and Speaker Nancy Pelosi to hold this President and Vice President accountable for their high crimes and misdemeanors.
[03:10:32.283 --> 03:10:36.507]  You know, Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, put it very well the other day.
[03:10:36.507 --> 03:10:40.170]  He said, quote, we tried a monarchy once, but it didn't work.
[03:10:41.340 --> 03:10:44.441]  Ralph Nader, presidential candidate, is our guest.
[03:10:44.441 --> 03:10:47.182]  We'll tell you about the websites and the campaign before he leaves us.
[03:10:47.182 --> 03:11:03.027]  By the way, Alex, just to finish, I was up in Kennebunkport, where the Bushes have their palatial estate, and I made the same point on impeachment, and that's up on our website, votenader.org.
[03:11:03.027 --> 03:11:09.769]  Anybody who wants to see that statement, across the cove from the Bush family compound,
[03:11:10.522 --> 03:11:12.564]  Uh, can look up VoteNator.org.
[03:11:12.564 --> 03:11:13.966]  It's been getting a lot of attention.
[03:11:13.966 --> 03:11:16.148]  Mr. Nator, I've got to ask you a list of questions here.
[03:11:16.148 --> 03:11:17.469]  First off, you've been around a long time.
[03:11:17.469 --> 03:11:22.694]  You've seen a lot of corruption, one of the foremost corruption fighters out there, and we support you in that.
[03:11:22.694 --> 03:11:28.299]  But, you know, in your life studying this and seeing different personalities, I mean, here's just one small, tiny example.
[03:11:29.162 --> 03:11:31.343]  Uh, you have John McCain goes over to England.
[03:11:31.343 --> 03:11:34.224]  He has hundreds of donors to a campaign dinner.
[03:11:34.224 --> 03:11:35.064]  None of them are U.S.
[03:11:35.064 --> 03:11:35.544]  citizens.
[03:11:35.544 --> 03:11:37.125]  They admit it's all felonies.
[03:11:37.125 --> 03:11:39.945]  The London Guardian and AP report on it, but no other press.
[03:11:39.945 --> 03:11:43.366]  And John McCain just says, I don't care, I'll commit crimes if I want to.
[03:11:43.366 --> 03:11:47.948]  We have the White House memos with Gonzales and You saying they can torture children with pliers.
[03:11:48.488 --> 03:11:49.969]  I mean, what has happened?
[03:11:49.969 --> 03:11:51.170]  It's more than just corruption.
[03:11:51.170 --> 03:11:52.752]  It's like insanity.
[03:11:52.752 --> 03:11:55.234]  Like, they're trying to break every rule.
[03:11:55.234 --> 03:11:56.055]  They're trying.
[03:11:56.055 --> 03:11:58.677]  Even the Nazis didn't admit they tortured people.
[03:11:58.677 --> 03:11:59.658]  They just did it in secret.
[03:11:59.658 --> 03:12:01.459]  I mean, the mindset of these people.
[03:12:01.459 --> 03:12:03.141]  I'm worried they may stage a vent.
[03:12:03.141 --> 03:12:05.803]  They may start another war with Iran.
[03:12:05.803 --> 03:12:09.426]  I mean, they're building FEMA camps that's now in the newspapers.
[03:12:09.426 --> 03:12:11.968]  They're setting up private death squads.
[03:12:11.968 --> 03:12:14.631]  I mean, can you just speak to what we've seen?
[03:12:15.271 --> 03:12:23.958]  I mean, not just the articles of impeachment, but just the total lawlessness and why you think they're doing it, because there's got to be some method to this, or is it just total megalomania?
[03:12:23.958 --> 03:12:25.540]  Lawlessness is the right word.
[03:12:25.540 --> 03:12:27.101]  This is an outlaw presidency.
[03:12:27.951 --> 03:12:30.653]  This is a president who thinks he's above the law, beyond the law.
[03:12:30.653 --> 03:12:32.333]  He can do anything he wants.
[03:12:32.333 --> 03:12:35.175]  He can arrest and throw in prison anybody he wants.
[03:12:35.175 --> 03:12:40.718]  He can invade and attack any country in the world that he wants, and he's effectively said that.
[03:12:40.718 --> 03:12:44.440]  And he can violate any constitutional provision or federal law that he wants.
[03:12:44.440 --> 03:12:46.301]  Now, how does he get away with it?
[03:12:46.301 --> 03:12:48.622]  Because there's no opposition party to speak of.
[03:12:48.622 --> 03:12:52.284]  The Democratic Party have just lain down on the job.
[03:12:52.284 --> 03:12:55.485]  They control Congress, but they refuse to have impeachment hearings.
[03:12:55.485 --> 03:12:56.606]  They even refuse to have
[03:12:57.162 --> 03:13:02.547]  Hearings on the constitutional and statutory crimes of the Bush-Cheney regime.
[03:13:02.547 --> 03:13:14.178]  And I notice a real tone of urgency in your voice, Alex, and it's well merited because this is a subversion of everything our founding fathers ever dreamed of for our country.
[03:13:15.040 --> 03:13:17.081]  And we've got to do something about it.
[03:13:17.081 --> 03:13:25.983]  We've got to contact our senators and representatives, and when they come home in August, I mean, surround their auditoriums with protesters and say, you've got to do something.
[03:13:25.983 --> 03:13:28.944]  Don't tell us that there's only six months left in the regime.
[03:13:28.944 --> 03:13:32.285]  And then the police show up and say, no protest allowed.
[03:13:32.285 --> 03:13:35.206]  Activists being arrested everywhere, building more prisons everywhere.
[03:13:35.206 --> 03:13:39.587]  I mean, it looks like this regime, backed up by the corporations, is going for broke.
[03:13:39.587 --> 03:13:41.008]  What do you think their endgame is?
[03:13:42.293 --> 03:13:46.147]  Well, I mean, their endgame is basically corporate fascism.
[03:13:46.978 --> 03:13:53.882]  That's what it is, the merger of government and big business for criminal purposes.
[03:13:53.882 --> 03:14:06.350]  And you'll notice that on our website, one of the issues on our table there, off the table for Obama and McCain, is an aggressive crackdown on corporate crime and corporate subsidies of the taxpayer dollar.
[03:14:06.350 --> 03:14:14.155]  And you know, this corporate crime has looted and drained millions of pensions of workers, small investors, laid-off workers, nobody's working for Enron anymore.
[03:14:14.577 --> 03:14:20.382]  Wall Street is a hotbed of crookery and crime, and you've got a war criminal in the White House.
[03:14:20.382 --> 03:14:25.306]  The shocking thing of it is, Alex, is how much are the American people going to take?
[03:14:25.306 --> 03:14:32.912]  Well, that's my point, sir, is that they look like they're accelerating it, and I'm worried that they'll even leave office.
[03:14:32.912 --> 03:14:34.573]  I mean, are you worried they might stage something?
[03:14:35.660 --> 03:14:37.561]  I'm worried they might attack Iran.
[03:14:37.561 --> 03:14:42.084]  Yeah, I mean, that way he shuts up the press, most of the press.
[03:14:42.084 --> 03:14:43.585]  He chills out the Democrats.
[03:14:43.585 --> 03:14:47.748]  He stifles dissent and concentrates more power in his hands.
[03:14:47.748 --> 03:14:59.535]  I think the hope for the country are these retired generals, admirals, national security types, the diplomats who have spoken out against the war, but they haven't organized into a powerful
[03:15:00.163 --> 03:15:03.624]  Uh, lobby against the war, against this kind of criminality.
[03:15:03.624 --> 03:15:10.845]  Although when you talk to them, when you read their op-eds and their statements, they're just terrific patriots, but they, one at a time doesn't do it.
[03:15:10.845 --> 03:15:14.046]  They got to all organize and that'll turn Congress around.
[03:15:14.046 --> 03:15:24.948]  Let me tell you, when you get all these heroes and patriots with the ribbons and where they've served all over the country up against these draft dodgers called George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, it's no contest.
[03:15:25.692 --> 03:15:30.535]  Well, it is a going for broke, and you're right, there's all these great patriots fighting back against them.
[03:15:30.535 --> 03:15:32.516]  Shifting gears into another subject, GMO.
[03:15:32.516 --> 03:15:39.940]  I mean, I've had the scientists who worked at the companies where all the rats would die when they'd feed them a potato over a few months, and then they put that on our table.
[03:15:39.940 --> 03:15:42.562]  I mean, again, it's like the corporations have gone insane.
[03:15:42.562 --> 03:15:45.664]  I don't mean your mom and poplin's listeners, I mean the big fortune ones.
[03:15:45.664 --> 03:15:47.145]  Yeah, like Monsanto and others.
[03:15:47.145 --> 03:15:51.187]  What would you do as president against these GMOs?
[03:15:51.187 --> 03:15:54.669]  Well, first of all, suspend any further
[03:15:55.489 --> 03:15:57.810]  GMO foods in the marketplace.
[03:15:57.810 --> 03:15:59.211]  They are not labeled.
[03:15:59.211 --> 03:16:08.054]  95% of the American people, when they go to the supermarket, they've said they want genetically modified foods in packages and elsewhere labeled.
[03:16:08.054 --> 03:16:09.655]  And Monsanto says no.
[03:16:09.655 --> 03:16:10.876]  The people say yes.
[03:16:10.876 --> 03:16:12.136]  Monsanto wins.
[03:16:12.136 --> 03:16:13.237]  The people lose.
[03:16:13.237 --> 03:16:14.917]  No democracy there.
[03:16:14.917 --> 03:16:23.961]  Also, there's a very good group in Cambridge, started by Harvard and MIT scientists, called Council for Responsible Genetics.
[03:16:24.503 --> 03:16:26.705]  And the website is genewatch.org.
[03:16:26.705 --> 03:16:30.427]  That's G-E-N-E watch dot org.
[03:16:30.427 --> 03:16:32.228]  You get good information there.
[03:16:32.228 --> 03:16:33.949]  There's been at least some progress.
[03:16:33.949 --> 03:16:42.635]  Congress is about to ban employers from deploying DNA information in order to decide whether to hire or fire somebody.
[03:16:42.635 --> 03:16:43.536]  Oh, that's another issue.
[03:16:43.536 --> 03:16:48.619]  What about police all over the country under federal grants taking blood at checkpoints without warrants?
[03:16:48.619 --> 03:16:53.542]  There's body scanners going in the airports that literally scan your naked body and save the images.
[03:16:53.542 --> 03:16:54.183]  What would you do to that?
[03:16:54.723 --> 03:16:55.804]  Well, I'd stop that.
[03:16:55.804 --> 03:17:01.687]  Because first of all, there are some things in people's packages that these body scanners don't catch, to begin with.
[03:17:01.687 --> 03:17:09.572]  And it's amazing how they want to have these body scanners, but the cargo is still very little examined of the passengers.
[03:17:09.572 --> 03:17:11.593]  One out of a hundred of them are cargo ships.
[03:17:11.593 --> 03:17:13.995]  Closing, Ralph Nader, running for president.
[03:17:13.995 --> 03:17:15.115]  What is the strategy?
[03:17:15.115 --> 03:17:17.957]  How do we help force you into the debates?
[03:17:19.190 --> 03:17:28.018]  Well, Google, at their headquarters the other week, wants to do their own debates, and you know, with YouTube as their subsidiary, they can pull it off.
[03:17:28.018 --> 03:17:33.742]  They want to start one in New Orleans, and they can deliver an audience that doesn't rely on NBC, ABC, and CBS.
[03:17:33.742 --> 03:17:34.623]  That's one.
[03:17:34.623 --> 03:17:38.306]  And the second is, really protest this debate commission.
[03:17:38.306 --> 03:17:42.570]  You can get the way to protest, go to the website OpenDebates.org.
[03:17:42.570 --> 03:17:43.651]  OpenDebates.org.
[03:17:43.651 --> 03:17:46.213]  Yeah, and you ought to have this guy, George Ferrer, on your program.
[03:17:46.213 --> 03:17:47.394]  He's the expert critic.
[03:17:47.972 --> 03:17:50.995]  Harvard Law grad, he's the expert critic on the debate.
[03:17:50.995 --> 03:17:53.757]  Yeah, we have these private, corporate hijackings of the process.
[03:17:53.757 --> 03:17:55.719]  Hey, listen, here's an idea, and I'm sure you've thought of it.
[03:17:55.719 --> 03:18:04.447]  Even if ABC, CBS, Fox won't let you in the debates, how about we have the real third party, the real independents, have a real Google debate, even if they won't show up?
[03:18:05.047 --> 03:18:09.430]  Exactly, and have empty chairs where these cowards are afraid to show up.
[03:18:09.430 --> 03:18:12.833]  Other Western countries have five, six people on the debates.
[03:18:12.833 --> 03:18:17.376]  These guys want it all to themselves, and they own the corporation.
[03:18:17.376 --> 03:18:18.557]  One minute closing statement.
[03:18:18.557 --> 03:18:20.498]  We're out of time, sir.
[03:18:20.498 --> 03:18:22.060]  All right.
[03:18:22.060 --> 03:18:24.761]  For 40 years, I've worked for the American people.
[03:18:24.761 --> 03:18:33.688]  You've got safer cars, and we've had drinking water safety, food safety, freedom of information, so you know what's going on, and you can sue the government to get information.
[03:18:34.147 --> 03:18:38.869]  We're opposed to subsidies, handouts, giveaways of your tax dollars to corporations.
[03:18:38.869 --> 03:18:46.172]  We want to put the corporate crime wave under the rule of law and prosecute these crooks, business crooks.
[03:18:46.172 --> 03:18:47.253]  Put them in jail.
[03:18:47.253 --> 03:18:50.754]  After they're convicted, it'll improve prison conditions.
[03:18:50.754 --> 03:18:51.895]  We want to reverse U.S.
[03:18:51.895 --> 03:18:56.217]  policy in the Middle East, impeach Bush and Cheney, repeal anti-union laws.
[03:18:56.838 --> 03:19:02.283]  Adopt a security speculation tax on Wall Street so they can reduce taxes on you as a worker.
[03:19:02.283 --> 03:19:11.991]  Put an end to the ballot access obstructionism that keeps dissent from getting into the arena, and dissent is the mother of all assent.
[03:19:11.991 --> 03:19:19.457]  And open up, the question is, why do corporations as artificial entities have the same constitutional rights as you, real people, do?
[03:19:19.457 --> 03:19:24.721]  And if they continue to do that, there's no such thing as equal justice under the law between you and ExxonMobil.
[03:19:25.211 --> 03:19:36.679]  So, log in to VoteNator.org, sign on to our email list right away, and you will get a real refreshing view of what this presidential race should be all about.
[03:19:36.679 --> 03:19:38.760]  Presidential candidate Ralph Nader, thanks for joining us.
[03:19:38.760 --> 03:19:40.882]  Will you check back in when this is as this develops?
[03:19:40.882 --> 03:19:41.462]  Will do.
[03:19:41.462 --> 03:19:44.004]  Miss you since I saw you at Crawford the other day.
[03:19:44.004 --> 03:19:45.965]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[03:19:45.965 --> 03:19:49.588]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:19:49.588 --> 03:19:51.389]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:19:52.029 --> 03:19:55.072]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:19:55.072 --> 03:20:00.797]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[03:20:00.797 --> 03:20:05.061]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[03:21:44.146 --> 03:21:48.268]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[03:21:48.268 --> 03:22:00.977]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[03:22:00.977 --> 03:22:01.417]  The U.S.
[03:22:01.417 --> 03:22:06.961]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[03:22:07.381 --> 03:22:10.363]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[03:22:10.363 --> 03:22:12.544]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[03:22:12.544 --> 03:22:15.526]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[03:22:15.526 --> 03:22:21.970]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[03:22:21.970 --> 03:22:25.392]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[03:22:44.136 --> 03:22:46.116]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:22:46.116 --> 03:22:51.458]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:22:51.458 --> 03:22:53.078]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:22:53.078 --> 03:23:01.480]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[03:23:55.614 --> 03:24:09.538]  Oh yeah!
[03:24:09.538 --> 03:24:12.379]  I got a lot of love.
[03:24:12.379 --> 03:24:15.800]  I just love everybody.
[03:24:15.800 --> 03:24:18.841]  Until I see them hurt innocent people.
[03:24:18.841 --> 03:24:20.721]  Until I see them push little people around.
[03:24:20.721 --> 03:24:23.102]  Until they try to push me around.
[03:24:24.482 --> 03:24:26.203]  That's right.
[03:24:26.203 --> 03:24:28.083]  I'm not here to be a slave.
[03:24:28.083 --> 03:24:34.486]  I'm not here to have my creativity and my liberty and my mobility stifled.
[03:24:34.486 --> 03:24:38.267]  I'm not giving in to the New World Order.
[03:24:38.267 --> 03:24:45.389]  I'm not going quietly into the night.
[03:24:45.389 --> 03:24:49.471]  Well, the Lisbon Treaty's shot down, official!
[03:24:49.471 --> 03:24:52.652]  And they say they're gonna go ahead and try to ram through EU takeover of Ireland?
[03:24:54.215 --> 03:24:57.016]  Whether the people like it or not.
[03:24:57.016 --> 03:24:59.696]  Keep it rolling, I like it.
[03:24:59.696 --> 03:25:00.416]  Oh no!
[03:25:24.159 --> 03:25:39.764]  You know, I wish I could just sit here and listen to music on the show.
[03:25:39.764 --> 03:25:45.346]  I guess I'd be a disc jockey.
[03:25:45.346 --> 03:25:49.127]  What an easy job.
[03:25:49.127 --> 03:25:51.748]  Baby, baby.
[03:26:00.168 --> 03:26:10.191]  You know, it's very satisfying.
[03:26:10.191 --> 03:26:13.192]  So satisfying to fight tyranny.
[03:26:13.192 --> 03:26:26.136]  To take action against evil and to see it bear such incredible fruit.
[03:26:26.136 --> 03:26:27.217]  Oh yeah!
[03:26:30.629 --> 03:26:47.899]  I mean, it is so important for all of you to come together as we pull through this dark night.
[03:26:47.899 --> 03:26:59.166]  You know, they say that adversity makes men, and plenty makes monsters.
[03:27:01.175 --> 03:27:06.016]  It is adversity that brings out the greatest in all of us.
[03:27:06.016 --> 03:27:14.878]  This Madison Avenue materialism is what has brought us to what we are today.
[03:27:14.878 --> 03:27:26.961]  But now the pendulum begins to swing back as tyranny comes to its greatest level in modern history with a scientific overlay the likes of which was never even dreamed.
[03:27:30.228 --> 03:27:45.451]  We see ragtag groups who love liberty and hate tyranny coming together on a thousand fronts.
[03:27:45.451 --> 03:27:47.591]  Oh yeah.
[03:27:47.591 --> 03:27:50.572]  I know your heart's like mine.
[03:27:50.572 --> 03:27:56.073]  And that's really it.
[03:27:56.073 --> 03:27:56.953]  It is so good.
[03:27:59.895 --> 03:28:09.279]  To be able to commune with all of you.
[03:28:09.279 --> 03:28:14.080]  To know that we're together.
[03:28:14.080 --> 03:28:16.881]  To know that we're going through that long night.
[03:28:16.881 --> 03:28:28.906]  We're coming through on the other side with daybreak and the rebirth of liberty and humanity pointing its great creativity and its love towards the stars.
[03:28:33.209 --> 03:28:40.211]  I am just so honored and humbled to know all of you.
[03:28:40.211 --> 03:28:46.773]  And I'll tell you right now that we are having a huge effect.
[03:28:46.773 --> 03:28:51.294]  And yeah, I'm having adrenaline rushes right now.
[03:28:51.294 --> 03:28:58.997]  I'm having endorphins being released in my mind right now because I know what matters.
[03:28:58.997 --> 03:28:59.877]  I know what's important.
[03:29:00.874 --> 03:29:05.438]  And we've had some amazing victories in the last few days.
[03:29:05.438 --> 03:29:07.800]  We're having a victory that we're waking up so many people.
[03:29:07.800 --> 03:29:12.104]  We're having victories that we just shot down the Libsyn Treaty.
[03:29:12.104 --> 03:29:20.751]  With EU expansion into Ireland, that will force the enemy now to act like what they are, dictators, and move ahead with forced implementation.
[03:29:20.751 --> 03:29:25.395]  That will only swell our numbers and accelerate the explosion of the alternative media.
[03:29:26.218 --> 03:29:31.421]  The enemy will then move to block the internet, and that will only prove our case that much more.
[03:29:31.421 --> 03:29:34.543]  Victory is within sight!
[03:29:34.543 --> 03:29:38.466]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:38.466 --> 03:29:41.147]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:44.690 --> 03:29:47.594]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[03:29:47.594 --> 03:29:51.999]  Matthew 24 states four times, in the last days many will be deceived.
[03:29:51.999 --> 03:29:55.563]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist.
[03:29:55.563 --> 03:29:59.328]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the antichrist?
[03:29:59.328 --> 03:30:02.852]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[03:30:03.172 --> 03:30:03.552]  We're good to go.
[03:30:25.191 --> 03:30:33.717]  For free books, DVDs, and Bible studies exposing the Antichrist, the Beast, and its mark, write to The Bible Says, Box 99, Lenoir City, Tennessee, 37771, or call 888-211-1715.

[03:30:33.917 --> 03:30:34.697]  It is a big idea.
[03:30:34.697 --> 03:30:35.438]  A new world order.
[03:30:35.438 --> 03:30:37.679]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:30:53.823 --> 03:30:56.646]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:30:56.646 --> 03:30:59.428]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:30:59.428 --> 03:31:02.612]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:31:02.612 --> 03:31:09.939]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:31:12.967 --> 03:31:18.411]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:31:18.411 --> 03:31:22.293]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:31:22.293 --> 03:31:24.855]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:31:24.855 --> 03:31:26.016]  Most people have no idea.
[03:31:26.016 --> 03:31:26.796]  They're not after money.
[03:31:26.796 --> 03:31:28.077]  They have all the money they need.
[03:31:28.077 --> 03:31:29.038]  They're after power.
[03:31:29.038 --> 03:31:30.199]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[03:32:53.630 --> 03:32:55.771]  I have never heard anything like it in my life.
[03:32:55.771 --> 03:33:07.999]  National radio host, Michael Reagan, called for the extrajudicial, no trial, the 9-11 truthers be killed.
[03:33:07.999 --> 03:33:08.920]  We just played the clip.
[03:33:08.920 --> 03:33:10.921]  He said we should all be taken out and killed.
[03:33:10.921 --> 03:33:12.422]  And he said, I'm serious.
[03:33:12.422 --> 03:33:14.143]  I want them dead.
[03:33:14.143 --> 03:33:15.264]  I will pay for the bullets.
[03:33:15.264 --> 03:33:19.507]  Kill us now.
[03:33:19.507 --> 03:33:22.749]  Ladies and gentlemen, this country is in the greatest crisis it's ever seen.
[03:33:23.786 --> 03:33:28.908]  If it falls, it will be a greater engine of evil than Nazi Germany was.
[03:33:28.908 --> 03:33:33.330]  It's already fallen to the Bush regime and they've destroyed our name.
[03:33:33.330 --> 03:33:36.251]  They've destroyed our currency.
[03:33:36.251 --> 03:33:40.713]  They've destroyed our treasury.
[03:33:40.713 --> 03:33:44.214]  The Bill of Rights, the Constitution is being dismantled.
[03:33:44.214 --> 03:33:49.416]  The leader of the Tories resigned yesterday saying that he basically discovered the government was setting up a dictatorship in England.
[03:33:50.669 --> 03:33:58.835]  Evil is moving across the face of the world, and in the midst of that evil there are incredible patriots who I just get more and more respect for.
[03:33:58.835 --> 03:34:04.520]  Dennis Kucinich, I have to say, really is the leader now against this tyranny.
[03:34:04.520 --> 03:34:09.103]  I have to say that Ron Paul isn't even as strong as he is when it comes to speaking out.
[03:34:09.103 --> 03:34:12.105]  Ron Paul did sign on to the 35 articles of impeachment.
[03:34:12.105 --> 03:34:13.727]  We salute him for that.
[03:34:13.727 --> 03:34:15.088]  But I have to tell you, Dennis Kucinich
[03:34:16.497 --> 03:34:21.222]  In this very dark climate has courage that no one else in Congress.
[03:34:21.222 --> 03:34:30.610]  I've not seen it and I assure you he needs our prayers because this is a very wicked group and the mainstream media has tried to ignore it.
[03:34:30.610 --> 03:34:35.955]  Cafferty and others on CNN and MSNBC with
[03:34:36.787 --> 03:34:44.852]  Some of the other shows like Countdown with Overman have been calling for impeachment but not really talking about the fact that Dennis Kucinich is pushing for it.
[03:34:44.852 --> 03:34:46.673]  The congressman joins us very busy.
[03:34:46.673 --> 03:34:50.094]  He's with us for the next 25 minutes for the rest of this hour.
[03:34:50.094 --> 03:34:55.197]  You can go to Kucinich.house.gov and read the 35 articles of impeachment.
[03:34:55.197 --> 03:35:00.400]  You can also go to Infowars.com and see the YouTube clips of his speech he gave a few days ago.
[03:35:00.400 --> 03:35:02.081]  Dennis Kucinich, I just
[03:35:02.859 --> 03:35:07.940]  I absolutely want to praise what you're doing for the Republic.
[03:35:07.940 --> 03:35:14.261]  You really are doing something, as you know, that takes a lot of courage.
[03:35:14.261 --> 03:35:19.642]  Alex, thank you very much for those kind words and for the honor of being on your show.
[03:35:19.642 --> 03:35:29.644]  Your listeners are particularly attuned to the erosion of democratic principles and what led me to finally introduce these articles.
[03:35:30.498 --> 03:35:43.923]  Was the totality of the offenses and the ongoing violations, and the possibility that we could even end up in another war, based on lies.
[03:35:43.923 --> 03:35:49.685]  We are losing our country to lies, to erosion of our civil liberties.
[03:35:49.685 --> 03:35:58.389]  We've moved in a direction that's profoundly anti-democratic, and Congress has a constitutional responsibility to put a check on an executive abuse of power.
[03:35:59.531 --> 03:36:17.141]  Articles of impeachment will do, and they not only set a historic benchmark for and a historic record for future generations, but they also send a message to whoever would be the next president that such usurpations and abuses are not going to be tolerated.
[03:36:17.774 --> 03:36:30.839]  Congressman, just to break down for those that don't know the process, you basically have brought charges to the equivalent of the grand jury, which is the House, which will then decide whether or not to indict, then it will go to a trial in the Senate.
[03:36:30.839 --> 03:36:39.142]  If Richard Nixon, who did one one-hundredth, literally, of what Bush and his crime syndicate have done, and if Clinton deserved for what he did,
[03:36:40.102 --> 03:36:41.623]  To be indicted in the house.
[03:36:41.623 --> 03:36:55.848]  There is no doubt that George Bush and his group of cronies must be indicted just to get our country's name back and to let the police and military know that what they've been ordered to do is illegal because now we see the precedent set for all forms of tyranny.
[03:36:55.848 --> 03:37:03.171]  Can you walk through how important it is that people get behind this process and how do we, you know, A, what has Bush and his crime syndicate done?
[03:37:03.171 --> 03:37:05.432]  B, how do we help you get this done?
[03:37:06.276 --> 03:37:22.739]  Alex, the first thing that I want to say, after listening to the way that you provided a capsule summary, is that you yourself are someone who needs to be appreciated for your understanding what's happening, your willingness to communicate it to people.
[03:37:22.739 --> 03:37:24.839]  So I thank you for understanding.
[03:37:24.839 --> 03:37:35.261]  I thank you for understanding the scope of the challenge that we face, and for outlining it in a way that you have, because it essentially, we, you know, these charges have to be presented
[03:37:35.754 --> 03:37:45.959]  To the Judiciary Committee, which then will hopefully hold a hearing and send it to the House with a report, which then will be voted on.
[03:37:45.959 --> 03:37:50.442]  And if the President is impeached in the House, he would go on trial in the Senate.
[03:37:50.442 --> 03:38:03.629]  This is a moment where we have the opportunity to reclaim our government and to reclaim all that's good and right in America and what we stand for, not only with respect to each other, but what we stand for in the world.
[03:38:04.807 --> 03:38:06.029]  I love this country.
[03:38:06.029 --> 03:38:12.398]  I get chills when I watch the flag pass by in a parade.
[03:38:12.398 --> 03:38:20.850]  I wear an American flag, and a blind person gave it to me because it has USA and Braille on it.
[03:38:21.437 --> 03:38:25.018]  So then even a blind person would know I'm wearing this flag because I love this country.
[03:38:25.018 --> 03:38:25.818]  I love the flag.
[03:38:25.818 --> 03:38:35.901]  I love what America has historically stood for, but I see our country as being destroyed by people who don't want to obey the law and just want to be a law unto themselves.
[03:38:35.901 --> 03:38:41.903]  That's why there's got to be an accounting for the loss of lives of our soldiers that
[03:38:42.962 --> 03:38:46.464]  We're sent there on a mission that was not based in truth.
[03:38:46.464 --> 03:38:48.846]  There's got to be an accounting for the injuries to them.
[03:38:48.846 --> 03:38:57.551]  There's got to be an accounting for the innocent Iraqis who have died, for the huge amounts of money that we're borrowing to be able to keep this war going.
[03:38:57.551 --> 03:39:08.057]  And every other president who has been held to a measure of accounting, their offenses pale in comparison.
[03:39:08.652 --> 03:39:10.233]  To the offenses of this President.
[03:39:10.233 --> 03:39:20.156]  And you've put out 35, let's just cover 5 or 6 of what you think are most important, and they're all very important, of those 35, Congressman Dennis Kucinich.
[03:39:20.156 --> 03:39:35.261]  Well, you know, the ones that deal with Iraq really talk about manufacturing a false case for war, and it's been just demonstrated over and over that all the representations that were made that Iraq supposedly had weapons of mass destruction, posing imminent threat,
[03:39:36.356 --> 03:39:40.457]  That it had something to do with 9-11 or Al Qaeda's role in 9-11.
[03:39:40.457 --> 03:39:49.039]  All of those attempts to try to get the American people to believe that an organized effort was made, in fact, were based in falsehood.
[03:39:49.039 --> 03:39:54.440]  And so a war of aggression was begun against a country that did not attack us.
[03:39:54.440 --> 03:40:04.743]  And such a war is in violation of international law, which puts George Bush in the reach of an international tribunal.
[03:40:05.379 --> 03:40:07.601]  This is why Congress needs to become involved.
[03:40:07.601 --> 03:40:14.105]  We cannot let other governments or other jurisdictions do our work for us.
[03:40:14.105 --> 03:40:24.933]  We need to look at the record and recognize that law has been violated and it has to become a matter of a systematic public examination when that happens.
[03:40:24.933 --> 03:40:27.755]  You know, it's said that you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.
[03:40:27.755 --> 03:40:31.458]  This country will begin to be freed from the grip of fear.
[03:40:32.202 --> 03:40:44.051]  Which has been placed its clammy hold on us since 9-11, and the capitalization on the events of 9-11, for political purposes, will end.
[03:40:44.051 --> 03:40:46.133]  And we'll get our country back.
[03:40:46.133 --> 03:40:48.434]  This is about getting our country back.
[03:40:48.434 --> 03:41:00.784]  Re-establishing the rule of law, getting back our civil liberties, putting aside, you know, enforcing posse comitatus, making sure there's no more torture, wiretapping, eavesdropping, or any of the things that
[03:41:01.229 --> 03:41:02.309]  That are un-American.
[03:41:02.309 --> 03:41:13.212]  We're going to reclaim America, and the impeachment resolution and the 35 articles are intent on doing just that.
[03:41:13.212 --> 03:41:15.952]  You've got quite a few co-sponsors just a few days into this.
[03:41:15.952 --> 03:41:19.093]  Tell us about that process, sir.
[03:41:19.093 --> 03:41:26.895]  Well, the bill just went to judiciary yesterday, and Congress adjourned for the week early in the day.
[03:41:26.895 --> 03:41:30.736]  We have now three co-sponsors, Congressman Wexler,
[03:41:31.283 --> 03:41:35.006]  Congresswomen Lee and Woolsey have co-sponsored.
[03:41:35.006 --> 03:41:40.691]  Next week will be an opportunity for people to become co-sponsors.
[03:41:40.691 --> 03:41:47.717]  I would ask your listeners to please call their member of Congress and indicate your support for co-sponsorship.
[03:41:47.717 --> 03:41:59.607]  I would ask everyone who's listening, please read the Articles of Impeachment because the more conversant you are, the more fluent you'll be in talking to Congressional staff about the urgency of members of Congress getting onto it.
[03:42:00.351 --> 03:42:14.020]  Um, my information is available on my website at kucinich.us, and certainly, you know, if you check, there's 100,000 places on the web by now that have information about the Articles of Impeachment.
[03:42:14.020 --> 03:42:25.087]  You know, this is the time for us all to get involved, and so what you can do is learn about it, read about it, be conversant in it, contact a member of Congress, make sure that they've read it, ask them to support the Resolution HR 1258.
[03:42:27.890 --> 03:42:29.151]  And then demand hearings.
[03:42:29.151 --> 03:42:30.072]  We have to have hearings.
[03:42:30.072 --> 03:42:32.675]  We cannot avert our eyes.
[03:42:32.675 --> 03:42:33.856]  So that's the key.
[03:42:33.856 --> 03:42:36.378]  The hearings will open up this evidence.
[03:42:36.378 --> 03:42:42.464]  It will become a televised spectacle, which is what we need, so more people learn about the crimes that have been committed.
[03:42:42.464 --> 03:42:43.525]  And by the way, you had to stop at 35.
[03:42:43.525 --> 03:42:47.228]  I mean, what about a million dead Iraqis?
[03:42:47.228 --> 03:42:48.750]  I mean, when you add it all together...
[03:42:49.070 --> 03:42:55.232]  But frankly, I've got to say that yours is very measured, and I would call even conservative, as bad as the 35 are.
[03:42:55.232 --> 03:43:00.174]  Now, I had read that 25 congressmen and women had, quote, signed on to it.
[03:43:00.174 --> 03:43:01.975]  I'd seen a media blurb.
[03:43:01.975 --> 03:43:04.856]  I guess that means they have publicly said they're supporting it.
[03:43:04.856 --> 03:43:05.716]  They just haven't had a chance.
[03:43:05.716 --> 03:43:07.217]  They may be confused about that.
[03:43:07.217 --> 03:43:09.918]  That may have related to the Cheney impeachment.
[03:43:09.918 --> 03:43:16.500]  I'm not aware that we have 25 co-sponsors, but I will find that out immediately.
[03:43:16.500 --> 03:43:16.841]  All right.
[03:43:18.599 --> 03:43:23.282]  How soon until we'll find out if we're able to force hearings in the House?
[03:43:23.282 --> 03:43:26.423]  Well, here's what I've said.
[03:43:26.423 --> 03:43:27.744]  We need to start making calls.
[03:43:27.744 --> 03:43:34.047]  And all next week, we need to be calling members of Congress and encouraging them to sign on.
[03:43:34.047 --> 03:43:39.610]  And also encouraging them to ask for hearings in judiciary.
[03:43:39.610 --> 03:43:47.835]  I'm going to be meeting with the Chairman of Judiciary and also with members of the Judiciary Committee, providing them with backup documentation for the charges that are in the articles.
[03:43:49.036 --> 03:43:56.863]  I'm, you know, and I feel it's important that they have a little bit of time to be able to read them and digest them and make a decision.
[03:43:56.863 --> 03:44:13.657]  I've made it clear, though, that in the face of statements by the House leadership that this thing is dead on arrival, that unlike other resolutions where, in fact, if you introduce a bill and it goes to committee, they don't hold hearings, it is dead, a privilege resolution is one that you can bring back again.
[03:44:14.341 --> 03:44:26.849]  So I've made it very clear, if there's no action within 30 days, I will come back with 60 articles of impeachment and stand on the House floor for 8 hours and read them.
[03:44:26.849 --> 03:44:31.032]  And so that the nation can once again hear what's going on.
[03:44:31.032 --> 03:44:34.834]  Congressman, I could never imagine reading these 35 articles of impeachment.
[03:44:36.141 --> 03:44:37.523]  A more provable case.
[03:44:37.523 --> 03:44:47.699]  I mean, in their own memos, their own executive orders, their own Pentagon battle plans, this fake newscast, paying for fake media, agents of influence.
[03:44:47.699 --> 03:44:49.381]  I mean, here's an example.
[03:44:49.381 --> 03:44:50.884]  This morning I ran across a story.
[03:44:51.829 --> 03:44:52.669]  Well, let me tell you, people who
[03:45:17.092 --> 03:45:18.072]  Our U.S.
[03:45:18.072 --> 03:45:28.875]  expatriates, people who live in another country, but are citizens of the United States, can contribute to the campaign of a federal candidate.
[03:45:28.875 --> 03:45:30.196]  But they admitted these weren't U.S.
[03:45:30.196 --> 03:45:31.016]  citizens or expatriates.
[03:45:31.016 --> 03:45:32.436]  Well, that's a whole different deal.
[03:45:32.436 --> 03:45:32.936]  I mean, I don't know.
[03:45:32.936 --> 03:45:34.237]  This is the first I've heard of it.
[03:45:34.237 --> 03:45:36.878]  That was the Rothschild meeting, yes.
[03:45:36.878 --> 03:45:37.618]  Wow.
[03:45:37.618 --> 03:45:41.599]  Well, my concern here is that in upholding the rule of law,
[03:45:42.900 --> 03:45:48.884]  We are basically correcting, you know, correcting the direction of our ship of state.
[03:45:48.884 --> 03:45:49.264]  That's it.
[03:45:49.264 --> 03:45:52.006]  We're complicit if we don't do what you're doing right now.
[03:45:52.006 --> 03:45:56.468]  We have a moral obligation to get behind Dennis Kucinich.
[03:45:56.468 --> 03:45:58.349]  Yeah, Alex, I appreciate that.
[03:45:58.349 --> 03:46:06.854]  I also want to say that I've just had my office check the impeachment resolution with respect to Vice President Cheney at 27 co-sponsors.
[03:46:08.490 --> 03:46:19.855]  Our bill that we just introduced, and people had to put their name in as they were leaving for the break for the weekend, we have three.
[03:46:19.855 --> 03:46:25.558]  By next week, I'm confident as people hear from their constituents around the country that they'll come back and sign on.
[03:46:27.589 --> 03:46:31.352]  With trillions missing from the Pentagon, three trillion spent on the war.
[03:46:31.352 --> 03:46:39.538]  You haven't heard the clip, but we played it earlier, of Michael Reagan saying that 9-11 truthers should be taken out some early and killed without trials.
[03:46:39.538 --> 03:46:41.719]  And he said, I will pay for the bullets.
[03:46:41.719 --> 03:46:46.623]  And I've seen similar rhetoric from these neocons in talk radio.
[03:46:46.623 --> 03:46:49.705]  It seems like they're cornered now and that they're more dangerous than ever.
[03:46:49.705 --> 03:46:50.586]  Can you speak?
[03:46:50.586 --> 03:46:56.490]  I mean, are you getting a sense, because you're up there in the catbird seat in Congress, that things are coming to a head right now?
[03:46:58.734 --> 03:47:05.378]  We, you know, our country, these events over the last seven years have really divided our country.
[03:47:05.378 --> 03:47:07.320]  And we need to find a way to unite.
[03:47:07.320 --> 03:47:09.961]  We can unite in truth.
[03:47:09.961 --> 03:47:15.925]  We need to understand that there's just deep concern that people have on all sides.
[03:47:17.003 --> 03:47:21.887]  That things are unfair and that people are being unfairly accused.
[03:47:21.887 --> 03:47:24.448]  Well, that's why we need hearings to bring it all out.
[03:47:24.448 --> 03:47:30.072]  Well, you've been championing the fact that we have the EPA report that the dust was deadly and they covered it up.
[03:47:30.072 --> 03:47:38.478]  Now, they've had to basically admit a lot of that in scientific studies, and we're called traitors for even saying we should give health care to the firemen and police.
[03:47:38.478 --> 03:47:42.281]  Well, I felt, you're correct in what you just said, but I will say this.
[03:47:43.652 --> 03:48:11.678]  That I feel strongly enough about bringing out the truth about 9-11 that I brought forth articles that for the first time make 9-11 truth a serious discussion in articles of impeachment, the obstruction of the investigation into the attacks of 9-11,
[03:48:13.171 --> 03:48:23.315]  The fact that the administration repeatedly ignored and failed to respond to high-level intelligence warnings of a planned attack.
[03:48:23.315 --> 03:48:27.317]  You've got them there and they were caught lying to Congress on that.
[03:48:27.317 --> 03:48:41.282]  And the fact that the 9-11, those who responded to 9-11, were not told of the dangers to their health and so they were encouraged to go forward without providing adequate protection.
[03:48:41.952 --> 03:48:46.417]  And that's an article as well, endangering the health of 9-11 first responders.
[03:48:46.417 --> 03:48:50.342]  Congressman, shifting gears, we don't have a lot of time with you because you've got the next segment.
[03:48:50.342 --> 03:48:52.685]  I know you're a confident, manly guy.
[03:48:52.685 --> 03:49:00.615]  You don't like to talk about issues like this, but we know that we've had a lot of suspicious planes blowing up, people committing suicide, people falling downstairs.
[03:49:01.255 --> 03:49:04.977]  You know, in the 23rd Psalm, which is always worth reading, it says, And I think we have to have confidence
[03:49:31.427 --> 03:49:39.609]  That there is a spiritual dimension in life which is always, you know, that we always move in.
[03:49:39.609 --> 03:49:53.772]  And when we do that, it's like whatever the will of that spiritual dimension is, some call it God, and I'll call it God, whatever the will of God is, is something that
[03:49:55.169 --> 03:49:56.250]  Whatever will be, will be.
[03:49:56.250 --> 03:49:58.151]  But I don't worry about that.
[03:49:58.151 --> 03:49:59.111]  I never worry about it.
[03:49:59.111 --> 03:50:06.035]  Congressman, I'm getting from you that you're committed, that you're just going to do your duty, and the consequences belong to God.
[03:50:06.035 --> 03:50:16.241]  I think we are here on this planet to do the work of God.
[03:50:16.241 --> 03:50:18.182]  And you know, now some people will
[03:50:19.534 --> 03:50:20.155]  I don't know.
[03:50:36.189 --> 03:50:38.212]  Congressman, final segment with you straight ahead.
[03:50:38.212 --> 03:50:40.555]  We'll be back in about two minutes, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:50:40.555 --> 03:50:42.097]  This is history you're seeing.
[03:50:42.097 --> 03:50:44.260]  We've all got to pray for the congressman.
[03:50:44.260 --> 03:50:50.949]  There are many types of storable foods, but how about a superfood that contains every nutrient that the human body needs for survival?

[03:51:19.862 --> 03:51:24.024]  You can save and invest your money, but in the end, food will be your greatest asset.

[03:52:46.879 --> 03:52:50.240]  Do you need to know the exact location of a loved one or a company vehicle?
[03:52:50.240 --> 03:52:54.242]  What can you do if your vehicle becomes one of the thousands annually targeted for theft?

[03:53:06.647 --> 03:53:06.927]  I think so.
[03:53:21.704 --> 03:53:22.044]  I think so.
[03:54:00.633 --> 03:54:02.593]  Alright, final segment with Congressman Kucinich.
[03:54:02.593 --> 03:54:03.213]  We salute him.
[03:54:03.213 --> 03:54:04.914]  We want to support his impeachment.
[03:54:04.914 --> 03:54:06.494]  Go learn the 35 articles.
[03:54:06.494 --> 03:54:09.875]  Learn what is documented and what's happening.
[03:54:09.875 --> 03:54:11.515]  Just amazing the courage he's got.
[03:54:11.515 --> 03:54:16.536]  And we were talking during the break just about how he's committed and that's just the end of it.
[03:54:16.536 --> 03:54:17.756]  We've got about four minutes.
[03:54:17.756 --> 03:54:20.017]  Anything else you think is key that people should know, Congressman?
[03:54:22.385 --> 03:54:30.072]  We're in a period where we need to reclaim our country, and that we cannot put on hold domestic law, international law, or constitutional law.
[03:54:30.072 --> 03:54:39.721]  There's no logical explanation for this impeachment being put on the table, or put off the table.
[03:54:39.721 --> 03:54:43.604]  This impeachment process can be very good for our country.
[03:54:44.835 --> 03:54:54.782]  Recalibrating our moral compass and helping to educate people as to what's going on and bringing about a consciousness shift that aligns us again with our basic principles upon which this country was founded.
[03:54:54.782 --> 03:55:04.249]  We've got to break this Washington mindset of insularity and unaccountability and reach out and reconnect with each other and with people all over the globe.
[03:55:04.249 --> 03:55:06.070]  This isn't about Democrat or Republican.
[03:55:06.070 --> 03:55:08.072]  It's not about right or left.
[03:55:08.072 --> 03:55:12.035]  It's about the truth, and the truth doesn't have a political party.
[03:55:12.035 --> 03:55:13.816]  Well, Congressman, I totally agree with you.
[03:55:14.663 --> 03:55:21.702]  On that we were talking in the break about how they're acting like cornered rats, but that shows that we're really having success here.
[03:55:21.702 --> 03:55:22.905]  And when you talk about how.
[03:55:23.695 --> 03:55:25.657]  This is the right thing to do.
[03:55:25.657 --> 03:55:27.258]  It is a fight between good and evil.
[03:55:27.258 --> 03:55:34.743]  There's no doubt true evil has reared its head in our time, in our country, and I don't see how anybody out there would not get off the fence.
[03:55:34.743 --> 03:55:38.726]  What are some of the basic things that average Joes can do?
[03:55:38.726 --> 03:55:42.389]  I mean, go when their congressman or woman is in the local district.
[03:55:42.389 --> 03:55:50.115]  First, it is important that everyone reads these articles, because we need to be conversant in what the issues are.
[03:55:50.115 --> 03:55:53.117]  The next thing is, call your member of Congress.
[03:55:53.624 --> 03:56:01.689]  And ask that member to read the articles, and after doing so, to sign on to House Resolution 1258.
[03:56:01.689 --> 03:56:05.892]  And then encourage us also, the hearings and judiciary.
[03:56:05.892 --> 03:56:10.675]  Now I have said, you know, people have said, well, this thing, they're not going to hold any hearings, this thing is a dead deal.
[03:56:10.675 --> 03:56:15.679]  I have said that I'll be back with 60 articles in a month if they don't hold any hearings.
[03:56:15.679 --> 03:56:16.839]  We're not going to let this go.
[03:56:16.839 --> 03:56:18.100]  This is not going to go away.
[03:56:18.100 --> 03:56:19.001]  We're going to continue.
[03:56:20.166 --> 03:56:27.056]  In our efforts to save this country from this calamity of deception and of anti-democratic
[03:56:28.207 --> 03:56:35.352]  Um, uh, behavior and destruction of the law, international law as well as domestic, and the destruction of our Constitution.
[03:56:35.352 --> 03:56:36.672]  I believe in America.
[03:56:36.672 --> 03:56:37.493]  I love this country.
[03:56:37.493 --> 03:56:37.933]  I do too.
[03:56:37.933 --> 03:56:49.781]  Congressman, uh, in closing, I would liken this to a new Declaration of Independence and people will rally to it and push it and expose it and if we can get hearings, uh, they will be brought down and we can get our name back.
[03:56:49.781 --> 03:56:51.362]  Do you agree with that statement?
[03:56:51.362 --> 03:56:52.022]  I think that's right.
[03:56:53.573 --> 03:56:54.633]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[03:56:54.633 --> 03:56:55.434]  Thank you, Congressman.
[03:56:55.434 --> 03:56:57.254]  Well, you've got several websites.
[03:56:57.254 --> 03:56:58.495]  Which one should we visit?
[03:56:58.495 --> 03:57:00.616]  Cassinich.us.
[03:57:00.616 --> 03:57:02.776]  Cassinich.us.
[03:57:02.776 --> 03:57:03.417]  And go in there.
[03:57:03.417 --> 03:57:04.877]  That's my website.
[03:57:04.877 --> 03:57:08.418]  If you sign up, we'll keep you posted on events as they unfold.
[03:57:08.418 --> 03:57:09.539]  I know you're a very busy man.
[03:57:09.539 --> 03:57:11.400]  We've got about a minute left with you.
[03:57:11.400 --> 03:57:15.021]  Can we get you back on in the next few weeks?
[03:57:15.021 --> 03:57:20.223]  It would be good if we talked in another week or so, so we could bring you up to date.
[03:57:20.223 --> 03:57:22.684]  Maybe we should do it just before the 4th of July.
[03:57:22.684 --> 03:57:23.224]  That would be great.
[03:57:24.125 --> 03:57:26.426]  All right, Congressman, thank you so much.
[03:57:26.426 --> 03:57:28.188]  And again, we salute you.
[03:57:28.188 --> 03:57:29.929]  We're all behind you and right beside you.
[03:57:29.929 --> 03:57:32.270]  And say hi to your wife and great staff for us.
[03:57:32.270 --> 03:57:33.451]  Thanks for coming on.
[03:57:33.451 --> 03:57:34.912]  Thanks to you and your listeners, Alex.
[03:57:34.912 --> 03:57:35.472]  Thank you.
[03:57:35.472 --> 03:57:35.772]  Wow.
[03:57:35.772 --> 03:57:37.453]  There goes Congressman Dennis Kucinich.
[03:57:37.453 --> 03:57:41.215]  And folks, I have criticized him on a few issues, but the guy is genuine.
[03:57:41.215 --> 03:57:43.477]  The guy is real.
[03:57:43.477 --> 03:57:45.338]  He is such a great speaker.
[03:57:45.338 --> 03:57:46.979]  He speaks from the heart and from history.
[03:57:47.859 --> 03:57:51.622]  And the enemy is completely out of control right now.
[03:57:51.622 --> 03:57:52.883]  They are very dangerous.
[03:57:52.883 --> 03:57:54.545]  They know they've wrecked this country.
[03:57:54.545 --> 03:57:56.206]  They know they've tripled the size of government.
[03:57:56.206 --> 03:57:59.929]  They know they've committed all these crimes, and they're going for broke.
[03:57:59.929 --> 03:58:02.031]  And I don't know what new events they're going to stage or what.
[03:58:02.031 --> 03:58:04.172]  We've got to keep them off balance.
[03:58:04.172 --> 03:58:07.495]  We've got to continue to expose the left-right paradigm.
[03:58:07.495 --> 03:58:12.659]  Or... I mean, just the economic crises is looming depression.
[03:58:12.659 --> 03:58:15.261]  Mainstream news.
[03:58:15.261 --> 03:58:17.263]  These are the times that try men's souls, and
[03:58:18.087 --> 03:58:21.631]  I can hardly sleep lately, the way things are moving so fast.
[03:58:21.631 --> 03:58:23.013]  We'll be right back with a second hour.
