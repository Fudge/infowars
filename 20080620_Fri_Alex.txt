[00:00.000 --> 00:07.680]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the
[00:07.680 --> 00:15.740]  GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:17.520 --> 00:24.440]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome it is the 20th day of June 2008 summer is
[00:24.440 --> 00:30.560]  just flying by I am not Alex Jones however Alex will be back in town this
[00:30.560 --> 00:34.640]  weekend he will be doing his Sunday show in the fourth hour today we're gonna be
[00:34.640 --> 00:39.960]  replaying his interviews with Dennis Kasinich and Ralph Nader and really I
[00:39.960 --> 00:45.840]  just want to recap this week and make sure that things do not fall under the
[00:45.840 --> 00:51.600]  radar especially the mark die situation I feel like we need to keep pressing on
[00:51.600 --> 00:57.160]  Michael Reagan and YouTube just like we talked about yesterday I really like to
[00:57.160 --> 01:03.640]  talk about this upcoming BBC special this hit piece I guarantee it folks the
[01:03.640 --> 01:09.640]  conspiracy files so far I can assess that the government spokespeople or the
[01:09.640 --> 01:16.960]  experts as they will be called will be Richard Clark Lizzo Martin Lizzo that
[01:16.960 --> 01:21.120]  is if you don't know who Lizzo is he is the head of control demolition
[01:21.120 --> 01:25.380]  incorporated a family-run business with heavy ties to the defense industry they
[01:25.380 --> 01:30.720]  cleaned up both Oklahoma City and the World Trade Center yeah no conflicts of
[01:30.720 --> 01:35.080]  interest there I know can control demolition just they're innocent they're
[01:35.080 --> 01:39.640]  come on they help cover it up that's why it's a family-run business you know he
[01:39.640 --> 01:44.280]  obviously has to sign papers in which you know he's not allowed to divulge
[01:44.280 --> 01:47.280]  certain things when you work with the military you sign away all your rights
[01:47.280 --> 01:54.360]  military owns you okay especially if you join them there is some new news out
[01:54.360 --> 01:59.080]  there I want to talk about McClellan doubts Bush knew about the CIA Lee which
[01:59.080 --> 02:03.000]  is possible I guess he wouldn't give the same reassurance is about Cheney
[02:03.000 --> 02:07.440]  obviously Cheney was one of the architects of leaking Valerie Plame's
[02:07.440 --> 02:11.040]  name along with Scooter Libby it doesn't even matter that Scooter Libby gets
[02:11.040 --> 02:15.720]  convicted you know he doesn't really have to serve time he gets his sentence
[02:15.720 --> 02:20.760]  commuted it's really the first time somebody was pardoned really it was
[02:20.760 --> 02:25.480]  really a pardoning because he will be pardoned before Bush left office he
[02:25.480 --> 02:32.760]  just commuted his sentence pretty unbelievable stuff but yet it happens
[02:32.760 --> 02:39.280]  every day and the waking masses still seem to be asleep on a lot of fronts
[02:39.280 --> 02:43.600]  unfortunately and that's why it's our job to get out there and spread this
[02:43.600 --> 02:49.600]  message and coming to the Info War on the 4th of July Independence Day I'm
[02:49.600 --> 02:52.560]  looking forward to it I am looking forward to the 4th of July this year I
[02:52.560 --> 02:56.360]  will be in Austin Texas but you know maybe maybe Austin can show me a good
[02:56.360 --> 03:02.360]  time on the 4th of July anyway 9 11 Chronicles will be out so if you're done
[03:02.360 --> 03:06.240]  partying it up you've already done the barbecue thing you done the family thing

[03:12.720 --> 03:16.920]  Chronicles truth rising you can sit down and watch it on your computer with your
[03:16.920 --> 03:22.800]  prismplanet.tv membership and probably get it before anybody else it's a
[03:22.800 --> 03:27.880]  fantastic film it's got confrontations with some of the highest levels of the
[03:27.880 --> 03:32.040]  global elitists as well as many of their minions you know Zignu Brzezinski
[03:32.040 --> 03:37.440]  trilateral commission he's a he's Obama's advisor at this point folks you better
[03:37.440 --> 03:42.040]  keep an eye on him all through the grand chessboard helped create radical
[03:42.040 --> 03:48.600]  Islamism that's right Mujahideen into Al Qaeda that's the guy just type in
[03:48.600 --> 03:53.640]  Brzezinski and Al Qaeda or just if you type in Brzezinski you'll probably find
[03:53.640 --> 03:56.880]  it but there's this great and I think they put it in truth rising I know it's
[03:56.880 --> 04:02.480]  in my film very briefly but it's him in the 70s with a bunch of guns and
[04:02.480 --> 04:06.520]  Muslims radicalized them against the Soviets and everybody goes oh well we
[04:06.520 --> 04:11.520]  needed to we need to help them because the Soviets were the enemy well we had
[04:11.520 --> 04:16.000]  actually pre-positioned ourselves to attack the Soviets and that happened
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.640]  before the Soviets invaded we wanted it but you'll never hear that in mainstream
[04:19.640 --> 04:25.240]  media it's a fable you know it's just like they don't want to cover Gulf of
[04:25.240 --> 04:28.360]  Tonkin and what really happened there obvious false flag attack to get us in
[04:28.360 --> 04:31.720]  traction of Vietnam all right I'm gonna take callers in the next couple of

[07:55.840 --> 08:01.700]  command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex
[08:01.700 --> 08:09.020]  Jones and the GCN radio network all right folks we are back it's the Alex
[08:09.020 --> 08:16.080]  Jones show and over info wars.com they have a great coverage of these drills
[08:16.080 --> 08:20.520]  that are going down in Florida and in Denver that involve these black
[08:20.520 --> 08:26.560]  helicopters that apparently don't exist okay apparently the black helicopters
[08:26.560 --> 08:34.400]  that were caught on tape don't exist so don't worry about it everybody is dressed
[08:34.400 --> 08:41.240]  in black it's a military ex-military police it's a combo pack but again black
[08:41.240 --> 08:44.840]  helicopters don't exist so the drill probably doesn't exist so martial law
[08:44.840 --> 08:49.200]  doesn't probably exist and we should probably just ignore it all and it
[08:49.200 --> 08:52.880]  doesn't happen to coincide with the DNC even though that's just one of the most
[08:52.880 --> 08:57.480]  bald-faced lies I just can't even believe I mean no one's no one's that dumb
[08:57.480 --> 09:02.200]  right everybody realizes that these drills that are running in Colorado
[09:02.200 --> 09:10.000]  right now and I mean right now it's the last day of me on Friday so here comes
[09:10.000 --> 09:19.600]  the weekend and today is the last day anyway so right now right now they're
[09:19.600 --> 09:24.560]  training for urban warfare in preparation for the Democratic National
[09:24.560 --> 09:28.920]  Convention they have to make sure it's gonna be an Obama love fest and they
[09:28.920 --> 09:32.200]  don't want legitimate protests out there they don't want people with signs
[09:32.200 --> 09:41.360]  saying you know Obama's associated with Zigny Brzezinski or Obama is you know
[09:41.360 --> 09:46.280]  CFR Obama's wife is CFR they don't want you know real conflicts of interest to
[09:46.280 --> 09:51.320]  be shown so what are they gonna do they're gonna bring in a bunch of goons
[09:51.320 --> 09:58.600]  that have shields red paint apparently and a violent attitude and they are
[09:58.600 --> 10:04.840]  going to provocateur that's right they are going to provocateur violence on the
[10:04.840 --> 10:09.760]  first day so they give it a black eye and protesting is bad further further
[10:09.760 --> 10:16.520]  demonizing the First Amendment okay and as they demonize the First Amendment
[10:16.520 --> 10:22.560]  this is gonna be great they'll just swelch down on the entire area and those
[10:22.560 --> 10:26.320]  who even had a permit the one Pete one group that had a permit that is setting
[10:26.320 --> 10:31.240]  them up to look bad had to change its name because we exposed them but it's
[10:31.240 --> 10:36.920]  same people you're probably gonna have the same result they're sneaky they're
[10:36.920 --> 10:41.640]  not that sneaky though I mean it's it's right out in the open anyway they are
[10:41.640 --> 10:45.120]  they're gonna get their permit and the free speech zone is going to expand to
[10:45.120 --> 10:51.040]  everybody it'll be much like the WTO and there will be no negative pins etc
[10:51.040 --> 10:55.080]  within a certain zone I mean you won't even be able to wear a pin you won't be
[10:55.080 --> 10:58.920]  able to wear a t-shirt the fear of inciting violence will be so strong
[10:58.920 --> 11:02.360]  you'll have to be one of these puppets with like you know a donkey and an
[11:02.360 --> 11:09.800]  American flag pin on there and an Obama is change bumper sticker and apparently
[11:09.800 --> 11:13.040]  they're busting people in so you're not even going to be able to you know get
[11:13.040 --> 11:15.860]  close you're gonna have to go to a pen to be
[11:15.860 --> 11:26.360]  busting even if you're allowed inside it's incredible we're all we live in folks it is honestly just it's
[11:26.360 --> 11:31.880]  beyond the pale at this point but I want to read you this one off of info wars
[11:31.880 --> 11:37.320]  dot com we are change Colorado chases black helicopters in Denver truth
[11:37.320 --> 11:42.560]  alliance and we are change capture history in the making preparations for
[11:42.560 --> 11:47.680]  the DNC are made in Denver as the military exercises drills in the city
[11:47.680 --> 11:52.680]  all captured by we are change Colorado exclusive footage of the chase was caught
[11:52.680 --> 11:57.760]  by we are change Colorado members Jonathan turtle Jason Josh Rob Shannon
[11:57.760 --> 12:02.240]  Nick and Brian a week of excitement exclusively captured by the crew in
[12:02.240 --> 12:06.120]  Denver here is the three-part video of the week's training exercises in Denver
[12:06.120 --> 12:09.640]  for all to see remember this is over at info wars dot com if you don't believe
[12:09.640 --> 12:15.200]  me if you're you're in your car you're giggling oh urban warfare training drills
[12:15.200 --> 12:21.640]  good I hate them Democrats those liberals they deserve to be panned up
[12:21.640 --> 12:26.920]  well it's not about liberal or conservative both of them are fake but
[12:26.920 --> 12:29.800]  again I think that we need a strong presence at the DNC we need a strong
[12:29.800 --> 12:34.280]  presence of intelligent people that aren't there to provocateur violence maybe
[12:34.280 --> 12:40.160]  to hand out DVDs to document the event to interview people you know to try to
[12:40.160 --> 12:42.920]  get some candidates or that's going to be the hardest thing to do
[12:42.920 --> 12:47.800]  well all right we are change Colorado has information on where the detention
[12:47.800 --> 12:54.880]  facilities will be for the DNC as well as the staging area and police HQ that's
[12:54.880 --> 12:57.160]  right they've already got the police headquarters and everybody's in black
[12:57.160 --> 13:01.680]  again this isn't like you're going to be able to identify who's who or what's
[13:01.680 --> 13:12.000]  what the bottom line is black uniforms black helicopters police headquarters of
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.760]  large quarters so they can just put you in internment camps and free speech zones
[13:15.760 --> 13:18.520]  for those who didn't get a permit and the ones that got a permit want to
[13:18.520 --> 13:21.600]  provoke it for the event I really hope I'm getting through to a lot of people I
[13:21.600 --> 13:26.920]  know that I'm kind of covering this heavy and it's a little bit early for the
[13:26.920 --> 13:33.000]  DNC the DNC takes place August 25th to August 28th but no one else is talking
[13:33.000 --> 13:40.480]  about this and it is June 20th so we're about 60 days away from this event now's
[13:40.480 --> 13:45.400]  the time to prep out now's the time to decide to go to Denver now's the time to
[13:45.400 --> 13:49.720]  educate other people when somebody starts to act violent and try to incite that
[13:49.720 --> 13:54.880]  that's the provocateur when they throw paint on somebody that's the cop you know
[13:54.880 --> 13:58.960]  I should pull up I would pull up that Canadian clip but the guy curses too much
[13:58.960 --> 14:04.560]  this guy he's wearing a mask he's by I don't know a dozen or so protesters in
[14:04.560 --> 14:11.560]  Canada he starts saying come on let's throw rocks at the cops and he's
[14:11.560 --> 14:14.880]  cursing at the cops and this and that and everybody's like no man you're a cop
[14:14.880 --> 14:21.160]  we know you're a cop now you're a cop yeah come on let's throw this and that so
[14:21.160 --> 14:25.880]  then the cops have to come in and they take the guy down and lo and behold
[14:25.880 --> 14:30.160]  he's wearing the same exact cop-issued boots don't believe me throw it into
[14:30.160 --> 14:36.360]  Google throw it into I also am a huge fan of the University of Google I mean
[14:36.360 --> 14:41.240]  Google's motto used to be don't be evil obviously attended Bilderberg this year
[14:41.240 --> 14:45.920]  obviously has turned eagle we evil we've caught them censoring loose change we've
[14:45.920 --> 14:51.760]  caught them censoring Alex's films and really making the the graphic user
[14:51.760 --> 14:55.640]  interface that much more difficult without a numbering system used to know
[14:55.640 --> 15:01.000]  what the top 100 was so you could say hey we ranked such and such you also get
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.080]  used to see how many hits you had now you can only check the videos that you've
[15:04.080 --> 15:09.680]  posted and it's just it's ridiculously highly regulated
[15:09.680 --> 15:20.640]  they have turned Google into their new little information gathering off I
[15:20.640 --> 15:26.280]  think you know I really do believe that and you know it's unfortunate but we
[15:26.280 --> 15:28.960]  got to use the tools they they're allowing us to have at this point because
[15:28.960 --> 15:32.760]  they don't want us to have those tools much anymore and that's what the show
[15:32.760 --> 15:37.840]  is about this this show is preparing you for what's to come and how to fight it
[15:37.840 --> 15:44.040]  and what is to come is internet too and we need to fight that big time in Beaumont
[15:44.040 --> 15:49.920]  Texas right now Time Warner has put in a new program where it's paid paid by
[15:49.920 --> 15:54.760]  bandwidth now let me let me explain what this means most people it won't mean
[15:54.760 --> 16:00.000]  much but if you're running a home business or if you download content that
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.960]  is more than just pictures in other words let's say you have a subscription
[16:02.960 --> 16:07.080]  service much like Netflix I know there's some of these movie subscription
[16:07.080 --> 16:11.040]  services and you pay like 8 bucks but you have unlimited downloads of all these
[16:11.040 --> 16:17.040]  Hollywood MGM movies blah blah blah well now if you start downloading those
[16:17.040 --> 16:20.320]  movies on top of that eight dollars you're going to be capped at a certain
[16:20.320 --> 16:25.640]  amount let's say the movies are between I don't know let's say they're they're a
[16:25.640 --> 16:30.560]  little less than a gig all right so after 40 of those movies and that doesn't
[16:30.560 --> 16:35.200]  include any other internet traffic if you download some music or you visit some
[16:35.200 --> 16:39.200]  websites after that you're going to be paying a dollar plus for each other
[16:39.200 --> 16:45.640]  movie again why should I have to pay on top of what I'm already paying for the
[16:45.640 --> 16:48.600]  service they're going to say oh you're using too much bandwidth well in
[16:48.600 --> 16:54.080]  actuality you're going to gouge grandma who's going to use I don't know maybe
[16:54.080 --> 16:59.120]  one gig a month doesn't download anything but her email and pictures and
[16:59.120 --> 17:05.320]  surf the net so you're making up for it there now if you have a business and
[17:05.320 --> 17:10.280]  let's say it's in the graphics industry or in the video industry I mean these
[17:10.280 --> 17:14.000]  are industries that I'm familiar with and you do a lot of FTPing which I've
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.880]  done in the past you have to get this Photoshop file up or you have to get
[17:18.880 --> 17:24.600]  this uncompressed AVI up sometimes those are in the gigabytes each and in a day
[17:24.600 --> 17:31.120]  you could go through 10 20 gigs now you're not a huge business you're you
[17:31.120 --> 17:35.880]  and maybe you have a secretary that comes in a couple days a week and you
[17:35.880 --> 17:40.400]  know maybe you have one other person that helps out maybe a partner that does
[17:40.400 --> 17:45.120]  some of the editing or graphics with you now you're going to be penal how are
[17:45.120 --> 17:49.200]  you supposed to run your little business out of your small home it's
[17:49.200 --> 17:53.840]  absolute nonsense and this paper bandwidth is just Nazism in my opinion
[17:53.840 --> 17:58.960]  and that's just part of it they're also training us to biometrically scan to
[17:58.960 --> 18:02.160]  get on the internet all right that's what those little biometric scanner
[18:02.160 --> 18:09.200]  laptops those IBM ThinkPads are I was disgusted one day when my buddy comes
[18:09.200 --> 18:12.600]  and he's like yeah man oh you can't get on hold on let me let me scan my thumb
[18:12.600 --> 18:16.440]  I'm like you have the biometric thumb scanner on your thing he's like yeah
[18:16.440 --> 18:19.480]  it's awesome no one get on my computer I'm like you realize what that's what
[18:19.480 --> 18:24.680]  that's for and he's yeah it's security I'm like no it for eventually it's going
[18:24.680 --> 18:28.840]  to be your identification when you surf the net so from any computer if you
[18:28.840 --> 18:32.320]  want to log on you're gonna have to scan your thumb say you're over at your
[18:32.320 --> 18:35.720]  buddies you want to get on the net you're gonna have to scan your thumb
[18:35.720 --> 18:39.240]  unless your buddy has already scanned his thumb is logged in but I'm sure they'll
[18:39.240 --> 18:45.720]  have a log out and you know the cameras are already all up I mean there's
[18:45.720 --> 18:49.560]  cameras on every single one don't think they're not tapped into those yet see
[18:49.560 --> 18:56.520]  that's what that's another thing this domestic wiretapping and surveillance
[18:56.520 --> 19:01.360]  which was in place before 9-11 but 9-11 was the excuse why it you know it need
[19:01.360 --> 19:04.800]  to be massaged into place and then they even deny that they were wiretapping
[19:04.800 --> 19:08.600]  American citizens but then it came out they were wiretapping American citizens
[19:08.600 --> 19:12.560]  then they lied again and said it was just American citizens who were making
[19:12.560 --> 19:17.200]  outgoing phone calls to these other countries or vice versa it turns out
[19:17.200 --> 19:20.960]  that all that's a lie and they're just tapping whoever they want but they do
[19:20.960 --> 19:25.280]  it in a different fashion you know there's new technologies out there and
[19:25.280 --> 19:29.600]  they're they're utilizing that's why Google and Microsoft are at the

[24:30.920 --> 24:34.720]  email me directly I do go through my space and I do check out the emails I
[24:34.720 --> 24:38.960]  can't get back to everybody but I do read every single message and some of the
[24:38.960 --> 24:43.480]  stories come out of those messages now before I go to callers and we've got
[24:43.480 --> 24:49.480]  callers waiting in the wings I would just like to read this state of home
[24:49.480 --> 24:53.360]  Oklahoma resolution because I've said secession a couple times and I guess
[24:53.360 --> 25:00.240]  that's not entirely correct it's kind of wrong I guess it's claiming
[25:00.240 --> 25:07.320]  sovereignty still pretty good I'll take sovereignty what do you think all right
[25:07.320 --> 25:11.320]  a joint resolution claiming sovereignty under the 10th Amendment to the
[25:11.320 --> 25:14.400]  Constitution of the United States over certain powers serving notice to the
[25:14.400 --> 25:19.280]  federal government to cease and assist certain mandates and directing
[25:19.280 --> 25:23.400]  distribution whereas the 10th Amendment to the Constitution of the United
[25:23.400 --> 25:27.720]  States reads as follows the powers not delegated to the United States by the
[25:27.720 --> 25:32.040]  Constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states
[25:32.040 --> 25:37.720]  respectively or to the people and I could read the whole thing but it's
[25:37.720 --> 25:41.280]  pretty long maybe we'll get into it later but it's sovereignty what they've
[25:41.280 --> 25:47.360]  declared and it passed 92 to 3 go Charles Key he's a Republican again one
[25:47.360 --> 25:51.800]  person can make a difference all right let's go to George in Indiana George you
[25:51.800 --> 25:59.040]  with me hey how you doing George I'm doing great listen I've I've had a
[25:59.040 --> 26:03.640]  question about this global warming scam they've got and nobody's addressed this
[26:03.640 --> 26:07.400]  and and it and I think we ought to look into it if we had a climatologist or
[26:07.400 --> 26:12.480]  someone that could talk about it what if obviously we don't have global warming
[26:12.480 --> 26:19.920]  but what if they do cut back on the CO2 what can that cause in the future I mean
[26:19.920 --> 26:23.280]  are they looking to cause something to happen I don't think I don't think that
[26:23.280 --> 26:26.960]  I don't think that at all I don't think I think it's kind of a joke to them you
[26:26.960 --> 26:29.640]  know they're we're gonna omit CO2 no matter what I think it's more about
[26:29.640 --> 26:33.440]  charging people that's what the carbon tax is about so they'll still let you
[26:33.440 --> 26:37.280]  omit as much quote-unquote CO2 as you want you're just gonna get charged for
[26:37.280 --> 26:41.640]  it aka what that actually would do to the weather when we when we change the
[26:41.640 --> 26:45.440]  CO2 when it's not going into global warming could it throw us into another
[26:45.440 --> 26:48.880]  yeah but what I'm telling you is we're never gonna change our CO2 outtake we're
[26:48.880 --> 26:51.800]  just gonna start oh yeah yeah yeah we're just gonna start charging people for
[26:51.800 --> 26:54.800]  their CO2 outtake it's not gonna actually regulate anything they'll put out
[26:54.800 --> 26:58.400]  some bogus numbers that we've cut this and cut that but in reality they'll
[26:58.400 --> 27:01.320]  just under report it and they'll make the people feel like they're doing
[27:01.320 --> 27:05.560]  something good and in fact all you're gonna be doing is paying a couple you
[27:05.560 --> 27:09.600]  know a few probably a few thousand for the average family every year because
[27:09.600 --> 27:12.920]  you have two cars you have a big house you use a lot of energy you know how
[27:12.920 --> 27:18.040]  they're gonna tap that tax yeah I'll go or lays it out again is it's going to be
[27:18.040 --> 27:23.480]  how much carbon you use they're already training kids listen go to ABC just type
[27:23.480 --> 27:28.040]  in ABC planets layer into Google and they literally have a carbon meter where
[27:28.040 --> 27:32.440]  they show you two pigs one grown pig and one little piglet and in the middle is
[27:32.440 --> 27:36.400]  a is just a pool of blood which represents you after you put in the
[27:36.400 --> 27:40.920]  information and it tells you when you used up your carbon amount like the
[27:40.920 --> 27:44.880]  pigs live to be like I think it's three years and six years old before they
[27:44.880 --> 27:49.120]  take up their carbon lifetime so the pigs are good but we use it up in
[27:49.120 --> 27:52.880]  somewhere between 14 and 18 months on this earth that's right before we can
[27:52.880 --> 27:57.720]  even walk and we should just die this is a bill that was getting the mail that's
[27:57.720 --> 28:02.240]  what I'm trying to find out what listen just check out who's who's pumping it
[28:02.240 --> 28:07.040]  just type in carbon tax okay there's a bunch of mainline politicians right now
[28:07.040 --> 28:09.880]  I've seen it on the news more and more people think that they're doing a good
[28:09.880 --> 28:13.400]  thing in some instances other instances it's just the lobbyists and the powers
[28:13.400 --> 28:16.240]  behind them saying hey this is what you're gonna promote thank for the call

[33:51.440 --> 33:56.400]  Steve in Utah about torture and before I give you the floor Steve I just like to
[33:56.400 --> 33:59.240]  point out that Cassinage had this in one of his articles of impeachment brought
[33:59.240 --> 34:03.800]  up Abu Abu Grave and everything else so I mean this torture issue is out in the
[34:03.800 --> 34:07.400]  public it's just that the masses are choosing to really ignore it otherwise
[34:07.400 --> 34:11.640]  we would demand an impeachment of this president and the administration no
[34:11.640 --> 34:15.880]  matter when it was you know it doesn't matter that's the end of his term well
[34:15.880 --> 34:21.640]  it just seems like they are getting people on record and they're they're
[34:21.640 --> 34:25.920]  bringing people in and explain you know how it's working and where the holders
[34:25.920 --> 34:29.200]  are coming down from they're getting it documented they're actually getting
[34:29.200 --> 34:34.920]  people that are in the government to to state you know what's going on well I
[34:34.920 --> 34:40.240]  mean back in I'm trying to think when it was it's got to be now 2005 I
[34:40.240 --> 34:45.000]  interviewed one of the young gentlemen who went public at Abu Grave and again
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.200]  he was only able to speak at a whistleblowers hearing which dealt with
[34:49.200 --> 34:52.520]  many different issues actually Anthony Schaefer of able danger spoke at that
[34:52.520 --> 34:56.080]  same whistleblowers here hearing but this is a 20-something-year-old guy and
[34:56.080 --> 34:59.760]  back then he was telling where the orders had come down from and he was
[34:59.760 --> 35:03.760]  explaining that a lot of this torture was actually a third-party commissioned
[35:03.760 --> 35:09.360]  off to CACI forces that's khaki forces so yeah you'd have your general or your
[35:09.360 --> 35:13.160]  armed forces personnel inside there but the dirty work would be done by these
[35:13.160 --> 35:17.640]  privatized military groups so it gave them some sort of a plausible denial
[35:17.640 --> 35:21.760]  plausible deniability my big problem is that it takes so long for anything to
[35:21.760 --> 35:25.680]  get done these guys are murderers and torturers and a lot of times rapists
[35:25.680 --> 35:30.160]  which makes me sick and we're still having hearings you know five plus
[35:30.160 --> 35:34.840]  years later after the fact and at the end of it who's gonna be accountable four
[35:34.840 --> 35:39.240]  or five people you know the top brass will never be accountable Steve I just
[35:39.240 --> 35:45.760]  like I see it it's in my vision bush and the rest of them not just bush but you
[35:45.760 --> 35:49.920]  know yeah bushes of pop it bushes of pop it bro yeah people behind the scenes of
[35:49.920 --> 35:54.120]  the ones to watch I thank you for the call you know bush bush is a guy that
[35:54.120 --> 35:58.080]  reads what's written for him he doesn't have an original thought in his head
[35:58.080 --> 36:04.800]  folks well maybe about some blow maybe about some oh what was it there's this
[36:04.800 --> 36:10.320]  if you watch journeys with journey with George this is in the 2000 campaign and
[36:10.320 --> 36:14.160]  it's the press corps following around George Bush see he was already anointed
[36:14.160 --> 36:18.640]  to become president again journeys with George give me a break I mean his brother
[36:18.640 --> 36:21.800]  literally him and his brother laugh about how one way or another they're
[36:21.800 --> 36:27.760]  going to deliver deliver Florida but George he can't wait I mean he knows
[36:27.760 --> 36:33.240]  he's on camera and he knows that he's with the press corps so he can't really
[36:33.240 --> 36:38.560]  let loose and he's popping open a buckler he's the happiest guy in the
[36:38.560 --> 36:41.680]  world with this buckler and for those who don't know what a buckler is it's a
[36:41.680 --> 36:47.880]  it's a non-alcoholic brew and it's disgusting but he is go check it out
[36:47.880 --> 36:51.560]  bush in the buckler but journeys with George actually entertaining its way
[36:51.560 --> 36:55.400]  back in the day one of those little independent films God I love documentaries
[36:55.400 --> 36:58.520]  there's so much more interesting than the crap that Hollywood puts out don't you
[36:58.520 --> 37:01.640]  think I mean every once in a while there's a decent movie out there but you
[37:01.640 --> 37:05.720]  know that's why I'm involved with documentaries and speaking of documentaries
[37:05.720 --> 37:11.840]  before before we go to Nathan in Iowa 911 Chronicles truth rising coming at
[37:11.840 --> 37:16.440]  you prison planet TV members are going to get it first 4th of July that's right
[37:16.440 --> 37:22.160]  the 4th of July Independence Day and you can get it in high quality and it's
[37:22.160 --> 37:25.960]  gonna be a good time I I've seen the movie I'm very excited again you know
[37:25.960 --> 37:32.040]  you've got confrontations with Bill and Hill Clinton Greenspan Bloomberg okay
[37:32.040 --> 37:39.720]  John Edwards big names like Brzezinski Rockefeller Swartz and Ager I mean the
[37:39.720 --> 37:45.040]  movie's jam-packed you got interviews with Martin Sheen which is an awesome
[37:45.040 --> 37:50.200]  interview I'm a big fan of the Martin Sheen interview more confrontations with
[37:50.200 --> 37:54.960]  Gary Hart interviews with Willie Nelson interviews with Jesse Ventura
[37:54.960 --> 38:00.680]  interviews with Rosie O'Donnell it's cinema verite a shot unlike anything
[38:00.680 --> 38:04.000]  you've ever seen from Alex Jones remember it what is it for a prison plan
[38:04.000 --> 38:08.800]  that TV membership less than 60 bucks a year I know that and it works out to
[38:08.800 --> 38:13.080]  something like 15 cents a day you get all of his movies it's the way to go
[38:13.080 --> 38:17.560]  trust me I was a prison planet dot TV subscriber back in the day I can promise
[38:17.560 --> 38:20.760]  you that all right let's go to Nathan in Iowa Nathan what's on your mind
[38:20.760 --> 38:25.360]  hey Jason when you're talking earlier about Obama and the big no I guess how
[38:25.360 --> 38:29.640]  to call and recommend a book for anyone especially anyone that thinks that
[38:29.640 --> 38:33.560]  Obama is the lesser of two evils when it comes to McCain I'm talking about
[38:33.560 --> 38:38.200]  Webster Griffin Tarpley's new book Obama the post-modern coup and it's
[38:38.200 --> 38:42.880]  primarily about the big new Brzezinski the nature of fascism and it really
[38:42.880 --> 38:46.360]  scared the crap out of me I thought McCain was gonna be bad before figured
[38:46.360 --> 38:50.200]  you know okay how can it get much worse than going into Iran at least Obama's
[38:50.200 --> 38:55.000]  I don't get it out of Iraq but what this book shows us is that you know
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.440]  getting out he's not he's not getting us out of Iraq let me promise you that
[38:58.440 --> 39:03.120]  okay it's it changed we can vote for his bull and he's not he's never really
[39:03.120 --> 39:06.920]  said anything like that he says he wants to work to get us out of Iraq you can
[39:06.920 --> 39:10.600]  bet he's gonna stay in the Middle East but continue well that's my point is
[39:10.600 --> 39:15.120]  that if anything if we pull troops out it's just about saving our resources for
[39:15.120 --> 39:19.920]  the bigger event in terms of getting us in a war with China Pakistan and Russia
[39:19.920 --> 39:26.000]  which I think is much much much worse than going after Iran and what he shows
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.160]  us also is that fascism is different than just your mere totalitarian police
[39:30.160 --> 39:35.280]  state and that fascism starts off as a grassroots movement that's really
[39:35.280 --> 39:40.320]  controlled by the bankers much like Mussolini his March on Roman 22 and then
[39:40.320 --> 39:43.600]  that and he's just this ideologue that's pretty much trying to take all
[39:43.600 --> 39:48.480]  everyone's anti-authoritarian right now all this like we know right now the
[39:48.480 --> 39:52.560]  post or no one believes in government he's supposed to take that and use this
[39:52.560 --> 39:58.800]  movement to seize power and the point I guess is that McCain he couldn't break
[39:58.800 --> 40:03.400]  strikes if our economy crashes Obama could McCain would it be much harder for
[40:03.400 --> 40:07.680]  him to create you know universal military well let me stop you just for a
[40:07.680 --> 40:11.240]  second let me let me just yeah I will agree there the one thing that really
[40:11.240 --> 40:15.360]  does bother me about Obama is people do think that he's here to help America
[40:15.360 --> 40:19.760]  people are blinded because he is a good speaker he is charismatic and I could
[40:19.760 --> 40:24.600]  see him being a Clinton-esque type leader where he's actually leading us
[40:24.600 --> 40:29.720]  towards doom and fascism when he's so well spoken that we're just blinded by
[40:29.720 --> 40:34.880]  it we don't have somebody as dumb and overtly evil as a bush you know what I
[40:34.880 --> 40:38.680]  mean so I think that's the big problem I agree with you I'm not I don't want
[40:38.680 --> 40:41.720]  Obama as the president I want McCain as president either it's a really scary time
[40:41.720 --> 40:46.560]  brother I really do think we're getting Obama though I hate to tell you that I
[40:46.560 --> 40:50.680]  mean I I think they've set that one up let's go to blue in Texas blue are you
[40:50.680 --> 40:57.560]  there you're with me blue hey how you doing pretty good pretty good Jason yes
[40:57.560 --> 41:02.280]  gotta say you know you're a brave man you're you're a coal mine canary well
[41:02.280 --> 41:07.520]  whatever what's on your mind man say I've been listening to you for a while
[41:07.520 --> 41:12.560]  while you've been throwing in for Alex and you're doing a good job you know just
[41:12.560 --> 41:17.160]  wanted to clarify something that you may have misunderstanding about okay
[41:17.160 --> 41:24.440]  Posse Comitatus it specifically deals with how the Continental Army Continental
[41:24.440 --> 41:31.440]  Army shall not be used as a police agency it does not specify ruling out the
[41:31.440 --> 41:38.520]  use of the naval assets of them the Union or the Marines of the Union in fact
[41:38.520 --> 41:43.560]  today you have Marines who are tasked specifically with intercepting email
[41:43.560 --> 41:48.560]  because it doesn't violate Posse Comitatus and this has been a you know an
[41:48.560 --> 41:53.600]  operation that's been going on for almost a decade now well no I agree with
[41:53.600 --> 41:58.440]  you there because if you look at the able danger hearings they keep trying to
[41:58.440 --> 42:02.840]  make it about Posse Comitatus but able danger was this blackout program that
[42:02.840 --> 42:05.960]  was getting all this open source information and they weren't saying
[42:05.960 --> 42:09.320]  how and a lot of it was still classified so that's probably what you were
[42:09.320 --> 42:12.200]  talking about I'm sure they were working with naval intelligence as well as
[42:12.200 --> 42:19.000]  sent com and and the military my my big problem is that I don't really know that
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.920]  much about the the jackboots on the street that's more Alex's territory I
[42:22.920 --> 42:27.000]  do know that I'm very uncomfortable with seeing men in black uniform that are
[42:27.000 --> 42:31.520]  both current military and past military doing drills down in Denver in
[42:31.520 --> 42:37.920]  preparations for the DNC you know black ops police aka blackwater police now my
[42:37.920 --> 42:42.040]  my concern is the ugly head you know that's reared itself recently in the
[42:42.040 --> 42:47.240]  form of torture ships you know US naval assets or you know Coast Guard assets
[42:47.240 --> 42:52.000]  that have been spun off and they're now you know operating in international
[42:52.000 --> 42:55.720]  waters and when they're done torturing you if they kill you they'll just dump
[42:55.720 --> 43:00.760]  you over you know board and feed you to the fish well I mean hey that's that's
[43:00.760 --> 43:04.640]  the new America man and I'm glad I'm at least glad that the Supreme Court rule
[43:04.640 --> 43:08.800]  that we do have habeas corpus that really upset some of the bigger neocons
[43:08.800 --> 43:13.120]  like McCain saying you know oh this is terrible and then Newt Gingrich saying
[43:13.120 --> 43:16.560]  we're gonna have to lose an entire American city you know it's a bunch of
[43:16.560 --> 43:21.480]  propaganda I don't I mean we have to fight it that's the bottom line and what
[43:21.480 --> 43:25.120]  I've been telling people is if you're upset you don't like what's going on
[43:25.120 --> 43:28.720]  start becoming the media run for city council this this is the time to do it
[43:28.720 --> 43:32.560]  we're never gonna have another opportunity like this you know 2008 is
[43:32.560 --> 43:37.440]  where people should be so upset that by 2010 there is a difference in local
[43:37.440 --> 43:43.440]  government around the country I got a challenge group out of out of respect
[43:43.440 --> 43:48.640]  I agree that you have the right to your opinion I see things fundamentally
[43:48.640 --> 43:53.560]  different I think that you know the current political scene is just a stage
[43:53.560 --> 43:58.840]  craft and theater but none of this ultimately means anything because when
[43:58.840 --> 44:03.640]  the food stops flowing and you have food riots you'll have citizens with you
[44:03.640 --> 44:08.920]  know old-fashioned technology guns competing against you know cutting-edge
[44:08.920 --> 44:14.280]  state-of-the-art military equipment and they will ultimately prevail well I
[44:14.280 --> 44:17.920]  that's a bleak look at the future I thank you for the call I hope it doesn't
[44:17.920 --> 44:23.520]  come to that obviously doesn't either yeah I'm just I see the new world order
[44:23.520 --> 44:27.840]  winning well I'm not I'm not whatever hey hey I you're you're entitled to your
[44:27.840 --> 44:31.600]  opinion I'm in it to win it to you may think I'm a little too optimistic but
[44:31.600 --> 44:36.400]  I'm not here I hope you win I hope you win I know you do that I thank you for
[44:36.400 --> 44:40.640]  the call blue all I can say is I'm not gonna accept that reality until it's
[44:40.640 --> 44:45.360]  upon me and if it is hopefully I've prepared myself as that being a
[44:45.360 --> 44:49.680]  possibility you know I hope it's not the probability I feel like they like the
[44:49.680 --> 44:53.880]  soft incrementalism more than anything and that's why you haven't seen well
[44:53.880 --> 44:57.320]  other than the fact that we've exposed him but a large-scale terrorist attack
[44:57.320 --> 45:01.680]  somewhere in the world I mean 7-7 was somewhat large-scale but it's nowhere
[45:01.680 --> 45:06.560]  near 9-11 so we haven't seen anything that surpassed that yet I think I don't
[45:06.560 --> 45:09.400]  know if they think they can implement it yet you know I I've been looking into
[45:09.400 --> 45:14.280]  Codex elementarius and that's a that's a big food restriction deal and they I am
[45:14.280 --> 45:18.080]  scared you know the Plum Island situation kind of scares me maybe I'll
[45:18.080 --> 45:22.760]  play that Plum Island clip after this and show how they're trying to move this
[45:22.760 --> 45:27.600]  bio research facility from off the coast coast of New York which is on an
[45:27.600 --> 45:31.560]  island right around farms and livestock in the middle of the country there's
[45:31.560 --> 45:36.640]  four different spots I think Manhattan Kansas I believe that San Antonio Texas
[45:36.640 --> 45:40.360]  another one I'm not sure where the other two are but the ex-director of it is
[45:40.360 --> 45:43.880]  like you don't want that anywhere near animals he's like I don't think you
[45:43.880 --> 45:47.320]  understand the people that work there aren't allowed to have pets they're not
[45:47.320 --> 45:50.760]  allowed to go to the zoo or a circus if they've been working there in the past
[45:50.760 --> 45:55.960]  week because they still have the germs on their breath so is it a possibility
[45:55.960 --> 46:00.960]  yes hopefully it's not a probability hopefully like I said within the next two
[46:00.960 --> 46:04.880]  years we can decide again to become the government media and at least take over
[46:04.880 --> 46:10.320]  our local government again Oklahoma just declared sovereignty in an overwhelming
[46:10.320 --> 46:16.640]  vote of 92 to 3 all right let's go to Bob in Alabama Bob are you with us you're
[46:16.640 --> 46:20.920]  doing a great job buddy thanks man so I compared you to a canary if you're a
[46:20.920 --> 46:26.680]  canary you're a bull canary oh thanks man there's a movie out called in the
[46:26.680 --> 46:32.120]  Valley of Eli and for you biblically illiterate that's the valley that David
[46:32.120 --> 46:38.160]  met Goliath it stars Tommy Lee Jones and Charlie Saren and it's about the
[46:38.160 --> 46:43.880]  post traumatic stress syndrome from soldiers returning from Iraq it seems
[46:43.880 --> 46:48.840]  to me that the powers that be are trying to ignore this this movie it's great
[46:48.840 --> 46:54.240]  cinema and it's from a true story well I actually have it I have it I have it
[46:54.240 --> 46:58.920]  actually I haven't I haven't popped it in yet but yeah do it all right I'll do it
[46:58.920 --> 47:02.720]  you know I've met a lot of soldiers on this little journey of mine and you know
[47:02.720 --> 47:06.240]  a lot of soldiers that have come around and when I was in Colorado I met this one
[47:06.240 --> 47:12.000]  soldier who literally had this really bad PTSD out there and they they had
[47:12.000 --> 47:16.240]  prescribed this this I can't remember what it was but he ended up getting
[47:16.240 --> 47:19.320]  nerve damage from it but they were prescribing us this thing and what it
[47:19.320 --> 47:25.440]  did is it made him more and more paranoid and he was in charge of where
[47:25.440 --> 47:29.080]  they were going to cluster bomb basically where they were gonna send the
[47:29.080 --> 47:32.880]  the planes and bomb villages and he would always think people were attacking
[47:32.880 --> 47:36.560]  me he's like look he's like I was paranoid as it was and then I put me on
[47:36.560 --> 47:42.760]  this and it caused nerve damage and this guy had it even went over to to Iraq
[47:42.760 --> 47:47.280]  again as a private contractor for black water and after doing a tour there he
[47:47.280 --> 47:50.880]  just couldn't deal with it anymore and luckily he came home but he says you
[47:50.880 --> 47:54.960]  don't even understand what I'm going through even to this day and you know
[47:54.960 --> 47:58.080]  one of my best friends was over there and he doesn't even like to talk about it
[47:58.080 --> 48:03.240]  and he still can't even watch my movies because he doesn't want to believe that
[48:03.240 --> 48:06.720]  we were set up he doesn't want to believe that he went over there for
[48:06.720 --> 48:10.800]  anything but what they told him and I can understand that but I keep pressing
[48:10.800 --> 48:14.200]  on with him and I keep trying to get him to take a look at this information
[48:14.200 --> 48:18.040]  because he is one of my best friends and you know if something does go down I I
[48:18.040 --> 48:24.200]  want to buy my side let's jump to Steven in Texas Steven what's up

[48:28.280 --> 48:32.680]  Alex's absence the last time I caught a couple things I wanted to cover well
[48:32.680 --> 48:37.680]  let me ask you a question first of all I got a good friend of mine who's been
[48:37.680 --> 48:42.360]  really up on the conspiracy for years and he mentioned to me when I was
[48:42.360 --> 48:49.280]  talking to him a while back about and wired sciences I guess that's a site
[48:49.280 --> 48:54.920]  online there was a thing about this thing called shots fired which was some
[48:54.920 --> 48:59.000]  kind of new technology we're basically under homeland security they can detect
[48:59.000 --> 49:04.400]  a shot fired by any gun anywhere in the United States have you heard anything
[49:04.400 --> 49:08.120]  about this not a thing but I'm very interested in it and if you do see
[49:08.120 --> 49:11.880]  anything pop it over to Aaron at info wars calm I might Google that after the
[49:11.880 --> 49:17.680]  show yeah and I wanted to mention the last time I had two quick things the
[49:17.680 --> 49:21.880]  last time I talked to you when you were southern for Alex have you got a chance
[49:21.880 --> 49:27.600]  to check out yesterday I actually went to your site the 9-11 home page loose
[49:27.600 --> 49:33.240]  change home page and sent you a email again as a follow-up to last
[49:33.240 --> 49:38.640]  conversation with a hit when I had which I had with you about Scott Loper I did
[49:38.640 --> 49:41.760]  read that I did read that I don't really know anything about Scott Loper and I
[49:41.760 --> 49:44.760]  didn't get to check out you had a you had a site to check out but I didn't
[49:44.760 --> 49:49.200]  really get to get check it out I got like you know Aaron Russo had you know

[49:52.240 --> 49:58.440]  Republic calm if people go in that site the very first article it's about
[49:58.440 --> 50:02.640]  Scott Loper and people need to get on board you know this is a guy that was
[50:02.640 --> 50:06.800]  tortured by the Canadian authorities and kept confined in solitary for four
[50:06.800 --> 50:11.520]  years and you know now that he's in the United States and so for our State
[50:11.520 --> 50:15.860]  Department has done nothing to help this guy and yet here's an illegal
[50:15.860 --> 50:20.880]  Mexican that raped and murdered two women here in the Houston area back in 93 was
[50:20.880 --> 50:25.000]  convicted of murder and was going to die and Bush stepped in and stopped it
[50:25.000 --> 50:29.280]  because of the Vienna Convention because supposedly he didn't get to contact the
[50:29.280 --> 50:34.560]  Mexican consulate and you know so here's the hypocrisy but the bigger picture is

[54:45.680 --> 54:52.080]  call them the number one stunner out in uh congress right now 35 articles of impeachment the last
[54:52.080 --> 54:58.400]  three of which dealing with 9-11 others dealing with domestic wiretapping torture you betcha you
[54:58.400 --> 55:04.480]  go you go Cassinic it's not just about having a hot wife it's about bringing these people to
[55:04.480 --> 55:09.120]  justice couscous and he knows that and he said if they don't do anything he's going to introduce 60
[55:09.120 --> 55:14.960]  articles on the house floor now I know a lot of you out there didn't watch it maybe some of you
[55:14.960 --> 55:19.200]  out there it's the first time you're hearing about it for some reason I know most of Jones's
[55:19.200 --> 55:23.840]  audience is pretty hip but maybe you're uh you're on the road and you're just flipping through 35
[55:23.840 --> 55:28.880]  articles of impeachment over three hours on the house with almost nobody in attendance and he said
[55:28.880 --> 55:34.160]  he would introduce 60 if it took him over eight hours that's what I'm talking about he's my man
[55:35.040 --> 55:40.640]  all right let's go to Rand in Texas Rand what's up hey great show thanks man I just want to agree
[55:40.640 --> 55:45.520]  with you about a couple of points uh first uh you know Bush has never had an original thought in his
[55:45.520 --> 55:50.880]  life you know and uh I don't think any of his brothers or his father have either and you know
[55:50.880 --> 55:57.120]  they're just these you know spoiled arrogant little punks you know draft dodgers chicken hawks
[55:57.120 --> 56:02.000]  couldn't think their way out of a paper bag and they become president of the united states well
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.880]  I would say I would say that Bush Bush seniors really a schemer I don't know about Jeb and Neil
[56:06.880 --> 56:11.040]  you know I feel like they run uh they they just kind of run his up in other words they just kind
[56:11.040 --> 56:16.000]  of middle of the old guard I don't really I don't really think he's got any more brains than his
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.720]  sons do but he's just part of the old guard I mean you know people understand that you know I mean
[56:20.720 --> 56:25.440]  that that the levers the hands that are on the levers of control of our government now really
[56:25.440 --> 56:30.400]  there's a lot of the same ones that were around in JFK assassination yeah that's what I'm talking
[56:30.400 --> 56:36.000]  about copy Bush and and then you know Kissinger and you know then you get get into the Iran
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.880]  Contra scandal we had Elliot Abrams and Wolfowitz and Cheney and all these guys I mean these guys
[56:40.880 --> 56:46.080]  you know I mean they're part of this old guard you know have you ever seen a live in this world
[56:46.080 --> 56:52.800]  where deceit masquerades is virtue you know and they they've got their Zionist run propaganda
[56:52.800 --> 56:58.160]  machine spoon feeding the American cattle into believing they're you know virtuous and right
[56:58.160 --> 57:03.280]  on and stuff you know yeah absolutely have you seen JFK to the bush connection yeah yeah no I
[57:03.280 --> 57:07.280]  mean that's a great example and that's why I think he's a little bit better of a schemer you know he
[57:07.280 --> 57:14.000]  was able to stay clandestine in the CIA for 20 years almost you know under his dad of course
[57:14.000 --> 57:19.840]  Prescott Bush who was in with the OSS and the Nazis of course but uh but he was able to stay
[57:19.840 --> 57:25.040]  covert until he actually became the head of the CIA you know I just just appeared out of nowhere
[57:25.040 --> 57:31.120]  but I was I think that was his paper you know Nixon was going down in a watergate when he appointed
[57:31.120 --> 57:38.240]  both Bush's director of the CIA and John Connolly as secretary of treasury secretary treasury John
[57:38.240 --> 57:42.640]  Connolly was going down in the milk fund scandal I mean if he gets appointed secretary of treasury
[57:42.640 --> 57:47.920]  you know he says they were payoff well yeah you know the American people's been asleep for uh
[57:47.920 --> 57:53.440]  for a very long time my friend I thank you for the call I still think that Bush senior's a little
[57:53.440 --> 57:58.080]  bit smarter of a schemer you know even if he is and I don't think he's top-level management I think
[57:58.080 --> 58:04.160]  he's also a ruthless killer I mean all all uh fingers point to him having an involvement in
[58:04.160 --> 58:11.920]  uh JFK's assassination and obviously you know he was not a good guy when he was in the CIA
[58:11.920 --> 58:15.440]  I ran Contra all over the place you better believe it then he becomes the vice president
[58:15.440 --> 58:20.800]  under an actor for eight years and then the president for four more and then the next president
[58:20.800 --> 58:30.320]  is guy who ran coke for him in the 80s info wars.com

[1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:50.400]  and the special forces community okay had a buddy of mine from the national guard uh
[1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:57.040]  uh well we had to work together had a couple of buddies of mine uh they were pretty open minded
[1:01:57.040 --> 1:02:03.760]  and uh i kind of led them because i i kind of became aware as i call it about uh about a year ago
[1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:09.280]  so i read that book while i had time over there what i was trying to look up his name
[1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:15.360]  guys names names percy something wrote the book uh am i the only american it feels this way
[1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:20.480]  i haven't i've never heard of it but continue yeah he's uh he he's like he knows the constitution
[1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:25.920]  really well he like he knows the law better than like most uh judges do okay so me and this guy
[1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:30.240]  got together since he's in a national guard he's really he's really smart guy he pretty much aced
[1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:34.720]  the uh the entrance exam for the military even though everyone thinks soldiers ready there's a
[1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:40.320]  lot of smart people in the in the military and uh we come up with a plan that he's gonna sue the
[1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:46.560]  governor for for sending him because uh he found a way that he can do it because the the state wasn't
[1:02:46.560 --> 1:02:53.760]  actually in any type of uh emergency or being attacked in any way so he's gonna sue because
[1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:59.200]  he's a national guardsman and they sent him to iraq but he can uh no i my buddy was sent as a
[1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:03.840]  national guardsman i mean i took the asfab test with him i didn't end up joining but he ended up

[1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:34.960]  it is the most obvious example of controlled demolition it's not real the the materials
[1:10:34.960 --> 1:10:41.600]  of the technologies just aren't there if they were i know in the building i heard explosions
[1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:49.600]  outside the building i heard explosions i saw this building which had never been hit by a plane
[1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:57.040]  come crashing straight down for it to fall symmetrically and completely and rapidly
[1:10:57.040 --> 1:11:03.360]  was quite astounding could one use a controlled demolition on any building sure did it happen
[1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:14.320]  to the wtc seven of 911 no it did not as far as i know that's the first time it's happened in
[1:11:14.320 --> 1:11:18.160]  architectural history a steel high-rise building has collapsed simply because of damage and fire
[1:11:18.160 --> 1:11:24.720]  you can hear the building creak you hear things fall if there's a fire burning and you get here
[1:11:24.720 --> 1:11:33.200]  you know there's such a way above it no steel frame high-rise building has ever collapsed due to fire
[1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:40.080]  you know you have to look at what was inside building seven you have the largest secret
[1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:44.560]  service field office outside of washington dc you had the largest cia field office
[1:11:44.560 --> 1:11:48.960]  you had a number of government agencies inside the building i think we're just about the last
[1:11:48.960 --> 1:11:52.800]  ones in this building right now i think you should leave everybody else is gone
[1:11:59.360 --> 1:12:05.600]  the first explosion i heard when i was on the stairwell land like a boom like an explosion
[1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:14.320]  jane what more can you tell us about this collapse details are very very sketchy
[1:12:19.360 --> 1:12:25.920]  the entire half inch of the beam is gone entirely dissolved something happened to
[1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:36.640]  cause the steel to really thin and in some places to disappear entirely
[1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:42.640]  building seven is the first high-rise building in the world that has collapsed solely due to
[1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:52.960]  there you go folks there it is uh get ready i think it's july sixth sunday they're going to be
[1:12:52.960 --> 1:13:00.160]  playing that so well i'm gonna have to watch it and uh lord knows it's it's more than likely
[1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:04.080]  going to be a hit piece i'll be shocked if it's anything but i met the people that were doing it
[1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:10.240]  they didn't seem to uh have the truth in mind that being said before we go to collars i'd like to

[1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:18.000]  news a little bit but no one's mentioned it uh apparently clinton chronicles has been removed
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:22.880]  off of google video oh really i did a search for it and i cannot find it so i went and i
[1:15:22.880 --> 1:15:27.520]  contacted a few friends and i said hey can you guys find it nobody can find it we can find pieces
[1:15:27.520 --> 1:15:33.120]  parts of it but the entire movie has been removed off of google video and i find it uh you know
[1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:38.400]  extremely distressing that whatever last week the bilderberg group meeting hillary was supposedly
[1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:43.440]  there we have the head of google there now all of a sudden a week later it's removed off of google
[1:15:43.440 --> 1:15:49.120]  coincidence don't know it may be a coincidence but they don't like those documentaries being

[1:15:58.240 --> 1:16:02.240]  going to get a higher quality version of it anyway i pulled it off already i already pulled it down
[1:16:02.240 --> 1:16:05.920]  actually as soon as i converted over i was going to throw it back up on my account so everyone can
[1:16:05.920 --> 1:16:10.560]  have it yeah i mean it's an important documentary it exposes the fact that the clinton family is
[1:16:10.560 --> 1:16:15.600]  indeed criminals in fact uh earlier when i was ranting about the uh bush family i mentioned
[1:16:15.600 --> 1:16:20.160]  how after daddy bush the guy who ran coke for bush in the eighties became the president well
[1:16:20.160 --> 1:16:24.640]  that man is bill clinton and uh the mina arkansas scandal where they were literally
[1:16:24.640 --> 1:16:31.040]  shipping in the coke it's unbelievable we have absolutely unbelievable you know i have uh
[1:16:31.040 --> 1:16:36.800]  there was a bunch of uh hillary fans at my work and i said hey go google you know clinton chronicles
[1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:41.200]  and check it out when they came in the next day they were white as a ghost they had no idea
[1:16:42.080 --> 1:16:45.280]  they were just white as a ghost they were freaked out about the whole thing i was like
[1:16:45.280 --> 1:16:49.600]  hey i'm not making it up you thought it was giggly funny it's not giggly funny to know that your
[1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:54.000]  president you know was dealing cocaine a hundred million dollars worth a month yeah yeah yeah it's
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:58.080]  it's tough to to learn that the people that are running the show that we've worshiped for so long
[1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:03.120]  that we joke about because we think they have this upper echelon of sophistication and there's
[1:17:03.120 --> 1:17:07.440]  their fit to run the country now they're hardcore criminals a lot of cases they're a cultist and
[1:17:07.440 --> 1:17:12.320]  pedophile so you know that's a tough one to deal with have them watch a conspiracy of silence next
[1:17:12.320 --> 1:17:16.560]  get them in uh get them into the franklin cover-up let's see if they even come into work the next day
[1:17:16.560 --> 1:17:20.640]  oh they won't no that would just freak everybody out the entire place would think i'm just a mad
[1:17:20.640 --> 1:17:24.640]  man and oh my god how can you deal with this i don't want to deal with it it gives me too much
[1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:30.080]  too much anxiety yeah well you know what if it gives you this much anxiety to know about it what
[1:17:30.080 --> 1:17:34.000]  happens if it's you know what happens you know we keep going down the road we're going down with
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:37.600]  these people running the show what kind of anxiety you're gonna have that yeah it's going to be the
[1:17:37.600 --> 1:17:42.160]  anxiety of a jackbooth officer kicking in the door and shooting his family you know much like
[1:17:42.160 --> 1:17:46.320]  happened in uh in nazi germany that's what we're headed towards and i don't care for thank you for
[1:17:46.320 --> 1:17:50.880]  the call mike let's uh let's jump to the next caller let's go to greg in new jersey what's on
[1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:56.560]  your mind greg hey how you doing well it looks like the people's republic of new jersey has another
[1:17:56.560 --> 1:18:02.080]  fantastic legislator on her hands it's a assemblywoman jones quigley who's voting for one gun a month
[1:18:02.880 --> 1:18:06.960]  that's right one gun a month is now going to either try to make this law in new jersey
[1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:12.240]  one gun a month now what is this supposed to accomplish like the criminals are going out
[1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:18.000]  and getting a multitude of guns at one time legally well let me explain something to get a hand
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:22.240]  and this is for one handgun a month to get a handgun in new jersey you have to be fingerprinted you
[1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:27.120]  have to go to your local chief of police you get investigated by the state police in new jersey you
[1:18:27.120 --> 1:18:32.880]  can investigate it by the fbi your fingerprints get run through the national uh database of all
[1:18:32.880 --> 1:18:37.360]  the fingerprints of the fbi caves and then of course all the paperwork then goes back to your
[1:18:37.360 --> 1:18:43.920]  chief of police at that time you're only allowed to buy ready get ready for this only uh uh what
[1:18:43.920 --> 1:18:48.400]  you call it you get a permit to purchase and so it's signed by your chief of police he knows who
[1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:54.160]  you are he has your face your photograph your fingerprints and so i want to ask you this what
[1:18:54.160 --> 1:18:59.040]  person in their right mind would get involved in gun running from new jersey if they've got all this
[1:18:59.040 --> 1:19:03.760]  paperwork on you no it's absolutely ridiculous and i think it's even tougher to get a gun in new
[1:19:03.760 --> 1:19:08.640]  york state a handgun anyway you need recommendations for local police unless you're a celebrity that's
[1:19:08.640 --> 1:19:13.360]  correct well yeah if you're a celebrity or ex-military or a cop that those are about the
[1:19:13.360 --> 1:19:16.720]  only ones that have carry-in conceal permits in new york so i mean none of that think of it like
[1:19:16.720 --> 1:19:19.680]  this too so if you're a citizen in new jersey and they're trying to do the same thing over in
[1:19:19.680 --> 1:19:24.800]  pennsylvania with uh governor rindell so if you if just say for example you have a dad or a grandpa
[1:19:24.800 --> 1:19:29.760]  or something like that who fought in the war and has a collection it could be five it could be 10
[1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:35.680]  it could be 30 my uncle was it was a was an armor so he had a lot so basically what do you do do
[1:19:35.680 --> 1:19:40.240]  you have to forfeit the your inheritance let's hope not all right i thank you for the call greg
[1:19:40.240 --> 1:19:44.640]  yeah they want your guns it's no secret it's the alex joneshow we'll be back after this

[1:25:19.040 --> 1:25:26.000]  filling in for alex shone um next thing i want to talk about is basically you guys were talking
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:34.400]  about fingerprints and um all these types of uh surveillance um measures well here in minnesota
[1:25:35.200 --> 1:25:39.440]  um in fact i'm going to talk about an instance that happened a few months ago to me
[1:25:39.440 --> 1:25:47.280]  i was at the gas station buying packed cigarettes and he asked for my id id which is fine you know
[1:25:47.280 --> 1:25:52.480]  they always ask for my id they want to know how old i am to make sure i'm legal yeah so
[1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:59.280]  so i showed them my identification card i held it in my hand and basically i put my fingers
[1:25:59.280 --> 1:26:07.440]  underneath my birthday so they can see what year i was born and i knew that they had been
[1:26:07.440 --> 1:26:13.280]  implementing this process where they take your license and swipe it into the computer sure i
[1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:20.400]  get it all the time right electronic verification well i specifically asked him not to swipe my
[1:26:20.400 --> 1:26:28.560]  card and he proceeded to snatch it out of my hand and swipe it anyway so now you know my information
[1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:36.240]  is in their computer well i went to the same gas station line um chain and i went to a different
[1:26:36.240 --> 1:26:41.840]  store and i said the same thing please don't swipe my identification card and what do they do well
[1:26:41.840 --> 1:26:49.120]  we have to well why do you have to um it's policy you know and anyways i was pretty upset with them
[1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:56.080]  and um she swiped my card as well and i basically you know ask them how how can they do this this
[1:26:56.080 --> 1:27:05.120]  is basically like can i have your papers please so um basically she told me that that that gas
[1:27:05.120 --> 1:27:10.880]  station chain was being sued because the information that they were getting was not just your date of
[1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:15.920]  birth and here i've got a whole line of people that are like oh just let her swipe it you know
[1:27:15.920 --> 1:27:20.880]  and everybody's laughing at me because i'm concerned that they're swiping my license
[1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:26.960]  which has all my personal information a picture of me on it um into this computer well we're all
[1:27:26.960 --> 1:27:31.760]  slaves now i mean i hate to tell you but i mean this stuff is only going to get worse uh if people
[1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:35.760]  don't step up and that's why you know again i'm preaching to people i shouldn't be preaching
[1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:41.760]  so much but you need to become the government you don't like that go into your county and and go
[1:27:41.760 --> 1:27:47.200]  against this be like look uh i don't like that i don't care for it uh i'm sick of the uh electronic
[1:27:47.200 --> 1:27:51.760]  identification i don't think it's going anywhere i mean again i can't even get a check cash from a
[1:27:51.760 --> 1:27:57.600]  bank with my license when it's from the very same bank so again i guess we should just be thankful
[1:27:57.600 --> 1:28:02.560]  that uh they're not taking our blood yet although you know alex loves to report on the way they're
[1:28:02.560 --> 1:28:08.880]  taking your blood it stops and i've actually seen the mobile uh vaccinations that's pretty sick

[1:34:53.760 --> 1:34:58.640]  it's kind of a hodgepodge today let's go to dug in indiana what's up dug hi jason how are you
[1:34:58.640 --> 1:35:03.920]  today good man hey i'm the uh my name is dug williams i'm the author of the article uh fbi
[1:35:03.920 --> 1:35:08.960]  homeland security mind martial law exercises in indianapolis all right which was uh published on
[1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:14.000]  info wars dot com uh yesterday yep and i had a caller about that asking about when that was
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  going to take place in indiana so maybe you could give an overview well sure i'd be happy to talk
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:22.320]  about that i also called in because there was some disinformation from a previous caller concerning
[1:35:22.320 --> 1:35:26.880]  posicumetatus i wanted to correct as well all right so go over the first one and then we'll get
[1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:32.160]  to posicumetatus because i'm not 100 clear about that either okay well the operations actually ended
[1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:38.080]  yesterday it was a little over two weeks of operations they actually scaled those operations
[1:35:38.080 --> 1:35:44.320]  back considerably originally the mayor greg ballard had surrendered 26 sites throughout indianapolis
[1:35:44.880 --> 1:35:50.240]  most of those sites were either privately owned or owned by the state of indiana
[1:35:50.240 --> 1:35:55.760]  which is where the violation of posicumetatus comes in but i think due to some some activism
[1:35:55.760 --> 1:36:02.160]  and due to some public awareness the marines from the 26 me you were mostly restricted uh to camp
[1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:08.880]  adaberry also to a facility owned by racy on a well-known defense contractor uh they did conduct
[1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:18.160]  one operation at an occupied apartment complex where they had a mock uh terror cell um i'm not
[1:36:18.160 --> 1:36:22.080]  sure exactly what you would call it they said it was a raid possibly it was a raid yeah i spent two
[1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:28.480]  days doing an observation and then they raided this uh civilian apartment complex yeah you know
[1:36:28.480 --> 1:36:32.960]  it's the new freedom it's a it's the new domestic uh takeover drills and uh what would you like to
[1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:37.360]  correct on that caller because again i don't claim to know everything about posicumetatus but i do
[1:36:37.360 --> 1:36:42.320]  know that it should keep the military off my streets well it was some horrible disinformation
[1:36:42.320 --> 1:36:48.880]  he made some uh he's tried to connect posicumetatus to the continental army well number one he's
[1:36:48.880 --> 1:36:55.120]  about a century off posicumetatus is a result of the civil war and reconstruction i believe
[1:36:55.120 --> 1:37:02.000]  it was 1876 when the act was initiated there's also some additional misinformation that it somehow
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:10.080]  it does not cover the navy or the marines in 1876 it only covered the army that is correct but later
[1:37:10.080 --> 1:37:15.840]  in 1956 the air force was added and through regulation through the department of defense
[1:37:15.840 --> 1:37:22.160]  the navy and the marine corps were also placed under the posicumetatus act so you know that needs
[1:37:22.160 --> 1:37:27.040]  to be cleared up because there's a lot of dis info agents out there trying to tell people
[1:37:27.040 --> 1:37:32.800]  that somehow the marines are exempt from this act now part of the problem that comes in is color
[1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:39.360]  of law the criminals in charge have been using the color of law to to tear down posicumetatus
[1:37:39.360 --> 1:37:46.480]  since really since the mid 1980s with the war on drugs using a process they call mo use or
[1:37:46.480 --> 1:37:52.720]  memorandums of understanding and what this is this is where the criminals in washington take
[1:37:52.720 --> 1:38:00.720]  their appointed um attorney generals and they sit down and they write up basically potions on
[1:38:00.720 --> 1:38:08.400]  pieces of paper and they call it law and they say because using the military to uh interdict drugs
[1:38:08.400 --> 1:38:14.160]  in the u.s is so helpful and it's so fruitful that you know we're just going to go ahead and
[1:38:14.160 --> 1:38:20.240]  put the posicumetatus aside because we benefit by using the military and they call that a memorandum
[1:38:20.240 --> 1:38:25.440]  of understanding and basically they just rewrite the laws to to suit them and they ignore our
[1:38:25.440 --> 1:38:31.280]  traditions and you know i'm also a veteran as well and it really upsets me that our military
[1:38:31.280 --> 1:38:36.560]  traditions are being ignored because it's very important for our military not to violate those
[1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:42.400]  laws it's very important for our traditions it's very important for for who we are is you know as
[1:38:42.400 --> 1:38:47.600]  i think it's also a very important for the american people's safety that we don't violate those laws
[1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:52.160]  absolutely that's what it exists for you know i was a young paratrooper with the 82nd airborne
[1:38:52.160 --> 1:38:57.360]  uh we would be in formation and our officers and our ncos would tell us you know our role
[1:38:57.360 --> 1:39:05.440]  was to protect and defend the constitution and we uh we were controlled by civilians not the other
[1:39:05.440 --> 1:39:11.280]  way around and we were taught about posicumetatus and we were taught about the dangers of a military
[1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:17.840]  coup and that's what made us different from the rest of the world that's why these must be defended
[1:39:17.840 --> 1:39:25.040]  and you know i i i publish on a website called dailynewscaster.com and i have a loose confederation
[1:39:25.040 --> 1:39:31.040]  of other veterans senior officers senior enlisted people also some active duty people
[1:39:31.040 --> 1:39:35.680]  and we're very concerned about the direction of this country this you know these concerns
[1:39:35.680 --> 1:39:42.240]  and these questions are by no means anti-military they are 100 pro-military because it is the
[1:39:42.240 --> 1:39:47.600]  military that's leading the charge here absolutely to understand that absolutely i thank you for
[1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:52.800]  the call dog that's one of the best callers we've had all week and uh i hope that uh you're involved
[1:39:52.800 --> 1:39:57.440]  in operation inform the soldier obviously you're a former soldier yourself and know a lot of x
[1:39:57.440 --> 1:40:02.640]  military personnel i think it's very important to educate the next generation a soldier the
[1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:08.720]  generation that is now overseas and will be coming back to uh security jobs to privatize
[1:40:08.720 --> 1:40:15.280]  security jobs in most cases but sometimes into the military when we are violating a posicumetatus
[1:40:15.280 --> 1:40:21.120]  i have no doubt what's going on in denver is violating posicumetatus apaches come on black
[1:40:21.120 --> 1:40:28.560]  cocks come on everybody in black uniforms current military former military it can't be good and uh
[1:40:28.560 --> 1:40:33.040]  again if you wanted to know more about those uh drills in indiana i guess he posted the uh
[1:40:33.040 --> 1:40:38.560]  interview over at info wars dot com and it was a two-week drill i know that the denver drills
[1:40:38.560 --> 1:40:43.840]  are finishing up today all right let's go to troi in portland troyer with us yeah hey jason
[1:40:43.840 --> 1:40:49.040]  doing a good job thanks man all right back to building seven here i was wondering if you know
[1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:56.640]  of any videos that show the south side the supposed damage side of building seven uh they're out there
[1:40:56.640 --> 1:41:02.560]  yeah i got a video in loose change final cut where it's in final cut of the back side before the
[1:41:02.560 --> 1:41:07.200]  collapse yeah the guys run into the building from the from the south face of the building
[1:41:07.200 --> 1:41:14.400]  if you watch the uh it shows some of the damage though yeah this is uh this is uh at least one
[1:41:14.400 --> 1:41:18.960]  of the towers has gone down i'm not sure if both have gone down at this point but uh there's a
[1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:24.240]  couple of glass windows that are blown out couple of glass doors this is before whatever caused that
[1:41:24.240 --> 1:41:30.080]  fire uh was there because these guys run into the south face of the building they run through the lobby
[1:41:30.080 --> 1:41:34.720]  and then they run up the escalators that have been shut down up to the second floor and that's when
[1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:41.280]  the video cuts off and that's in the uh portion with uh barry jennings and michael hess so the idea
[1:41:41.280 --> 1:41:45.760]  that 25 percent of the building was scooped out again let me say this again yeah that that last
[1:41:45.760 --> 1:41:51.840]  gentleman who is on uh the bbc conspiracy files video that i just played sandar whatever he's the
[1:41:51.840 --> 1:41:56.720]  guy in charge of the nista investigation he's the main investigator and he told popular mechanics
[1:41:56.720 --> 1:42:02.400]  25 percent of the building was scooped up that's 12 stories okay you can't run into a building
[1:42:02.400 --> 1:42:06.880]  that the bottom 12 stories are are gone all right all right that's that's what i have to say about
[1:42:06.880 --> 1:42:10.560]  that i'd love to get more video it looks like they're gonna actually show that video because
[1:42:10.560 --> 1:42:15.200]  that's part of the the trailer in uh the bbc thing if you watch that trailer on the internet
[1:42:15.200 --> 1:42:20.080]  when you see those guys running up the lobby that's after one of the towers have collapsed so again
[1:42:20.080 --> 1:42:25.520]  damage from the tower sure there was light damage i'm not gonna lie but there's there there's no way
[1:42:25.520 --> 1:42:30.880]  that that huge fire that that uh that was kind of engulfing the bag wasn't even really a huge fire
[1:42:30.880 --> 1:42:34.960]  was a huge smokestack but it looked like it probably was an explosive from inside the building
[1:42:34.960 --> 1:42:40.800]  that's my guess i mean again you you've got uh hess and jennings talking about explosions
[1:42:40.800 --> 1:42:46.480]  inside seven that have nothing to do with the towers collapsing and then fema tries to cover that up
[1:42:47.200 --> 1:42:51.760]  jennings goes and talks to the 9-11 commission there's no mention of him anywhere in the report
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:56.640]  or building seven whatsoever it's a cover up dude yeah that's ridiculous but uh another question i
[1:42:56.640 --> 1:43:01.120]  had was there is there any of our guys that are you know structural engineers maybe some architects
[1:43:01.120 --> 1:43:05.040]  that have examined the way this building was built and have put their two cents in the you know
[1:43:05.040 --> 1:43:09.280]  yeah i mean richard gauge is the is the architect they lead in with and he's done some great work
[1:43:09.280 --> 1:43:15.120]  on it we have gordon ross in the final cut he's done some excellent work on it uh he's an engineer
[1:43:15.120 --> 1:43:19.200]  and uh i mean if you look at some of the really early work a lot of people always love to try
[1:43:19.200 --> 1:43:23.280]  to say oh there's no architects and engineers on the side there's never been that's that's just
[1:43:23.280 --> 1:43:30.320]  bull okay when uh reopen 9-11.org started that was jimmy walters organization they put out uh
[1:43:30.960 --> 1:43:36.720]  a 9-11 evidence dvd which was like this this big auditorium and a bunch of people spoke and uh
[1:43:36.720 --> 1:43:43.520]  jeff king from mit another engineer gave a thorough examination of seven so it's out there the paper
[1:43:43.520 --> 1:43:47.440]  works out there any other questions man no i know that's just what i point my friends to and this
[1:43:47.440 --> 1:43:51.280]  is what they come back at with me you know they say well there's all this information out there
[1:43:51.280 --> 1:43:56.400]  you know like the all the garbage in the ns in the nist report yeah you know and they say well
[1:43:56.400 --> 1:44:00.080]  what about all this stuff and it's just hard for me to well well this is what i would say look
[1:44:00.080 --> 1:44:04.160]  into it for sure well the nist report on seven hasn't come out it's almost seven years later
[1:44:04.160 --> 1:44:07.680]  it's going to come out they didn't even look at certain floors because they knew they couldn't
[1:44:07.680 --> 1:44:11.520]  look at certain floors check it out i don't think they look at uh floors seven and below
[1:44:11.520 --> 1:44:18.240]  and then point out to your friends that the other nist report took uh i want to say five years almost
[1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:25.200]  almost five years and uh it's 10 000 pages and in loose change final cut we confront john gross
[1:44:25.200 --> 1:44:30.320]  about uh the fact that they didn't explain the collapses they just quote unquote said that uh
[1:44:30.320 --> 1:44:35.280]  fire and damage caused quote unquote collapse initiation and then global collapse and they
[1:44:35.280 --> 1:44:40.320]  did no calculations to figure out why the rest of the building fell down and right he just says
[1:44:40.320 --> 1:44:45.600]  the video speaks for itself and then he denies the existence of molten metal because he knows
[1:44:45.600 --> 1:44:50.160]  if there's molten metal on the scene then their official version doesn't add up first of all
[1:44:50.160 --> 1:44:56.160]  their test where they uh they built the floor model and they put it under fire for a longer
[1:44:56.160 --> 1:45:00.720]  period of time with hotter fires than were actually at the world trade center and the thing didn't
[1:45:00.720 --> 1:45:07.200]  collapse it just yeah yeah it just sag and then secondly i would say their test to see just because
[1:45:07.200 --> 1:45:11.920]  they said that all the fireproofing was knocked off the steel beams on those floors their test
[1:45:11.920 --> 1:45:20.160]  for that was to take a shotgun rig it up next to a uh uh steel uh reinforced concrete piece and just
[1:45:20.160 --> 1:45:24.720]  fire the shotgun into it several times that's how they knew that the the uh fireproofing was knocked
[1:45:24.720 --> 1:45:30.560]  out are you being serious i am i am dead serious and you can watch those tests on the internet
[1:45:30.560 --> 1:45:38.320]  okay they hit like it's absolutely ridiculous how do you how do you prepare a shotgun a shotgun
[1:45:38.320 --> 1:45:43.600]  going off right next to a piece of steel to a plane crashing into a building i'll never understand it
[1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:46.800]  but you know the debunkers love to have their little talking points and they like to go to
[1:45:46.800 --> 1:45:53.440]  control demolition because they've often read these you know ridiculously long pieces of propaganda
[1:45:53.440 --> 1:45:56.800]  and they'll quote this and that and have no understanding of the real science but then
[1:45:56.800 --> 1:46:03.440]  their science is based on lies for instance when they say that there were uh 1200 degree or 1100
[1:46:03.440 --> 1:46:09.040]  degree or even 16 or 1800 degree temperatures on the floors the world trade center where the plane's
[1:46:09.040 --> 1:46:15.040]  impacted no no there weren't it would be absolutely impossible we have the firefighters audio saying
[1:46:15.040 --> 1:46:20.160]  that they are they are literally in the collapse zone on the 72nd floor and they can knock the
[1:46:20.160 --> 1:46:26.160]  fires out with two lines well guess what human beings cannot stand in 1800 degree temperature
[1:46:26.160 --> 1:46:30.800]  they can't stand in 1200 degree temperature they can't stand in 600 degree temperature
[1:46:30.800 --> 1:46:36.800]  try sticking your hand in a broiler you know it's it's absolutely ridiculous the the temperature on
[1:46:36.800 --> 1:46:42.560]  those floors was dispersed i'm sure there were hot spots of maybe five six maybe 700 degrees
[1:46:42.560 --> 1:46:46.720]  but then we have them yeah but then we have to get off the jet fuel burned off on the impact
[1:46:46.720 --> 1:46:52.080]  anyways absolutely a huge explosion outside of the building everybody saw it and then we have
[1:46:52.080 --> 1:46:56.960]  tape of molten metal pouring out from a concentrated corner of the world trade center
[1:46:56.960 --> 1:47:01.680]  two minutes prior to collapse now this molten metal has never been explained they tried to
[1:47:01.680 --> 1:47:06.800]  say it was aluminum from the plane okay when they couldn't win uh steven jones challenged that
[1:47:06.800 --> 1:47:11.040]  brought it into a lab and showed how it couldn't be aluminum they then switched their position
[1:47:11.040 --> 1:47:16.400]  and said that it was batteries i mean these debunkers go to no end to try to lie when they
[1:47:16.400 --> 1:47:21.680]  know their official version has been debunked and it means nefarious things for our government you
[1:47:21.680 --> 1:47:25.760]  think i want to believe that our government was involved in 9 11 i wish it weren't the case
[1:47:25.760 --> 1:47:30.800]  you know but it's not i mean we have to be grown ups this is reality i thank you for the call my
[1:47:30.800 --> 1:47:35.360]  man good caller i get to go off for a little while about the evidence you want to see it folks it's
[1:47:35.360 --> 1:47:41.280]  in loose change final cut everything i just said was covered all right let's go to tom in dc
[1:47:41.280 --> 1:47:47.760]  tom you're with me jason what's up man how you doing brother i'm all right over here in dc well
[1:47:47.760 --> 1:47:53.680]  relatively anyway what's on your mind hey listen has anybody mentioned to you to the ron paul appearing
[1:47:53.680 --> 1:47:59.760]  on glenn beck show and headline news last night no nobody why don't you recap it well not that i
[1:47:59.760 --> 1:48:05.200]  seek out that show i just happened to be flipping by and um i stopped because i saw ron paul being
[1:48:05.200 --> 1:48:10.560]  interviewed and there was a fill-in host for glenn beck and during the course of the interview
[1:48:10.560 --> 1:48:15.840]  he specifically the fill-in host specifically asked ron paul about the 9 11 truth movement
[1:48:16.480 --> 1:48:23.600]  about the film endgame and about the builder burgers really and i thought it was very interesting
[1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:29.600]  that uh he was taking the discussion in that direction and that he was really coming from
[1:48:29.600 --> 1:48:35.840]  the perspective of asking why do people that uh support the 9 11 truth movement or are interested
[1:48:35.840 --> 1:48:40.720]  in films like endgame and the builder burgers such a big supporters of ron paul he couldn't
[1:48:40.720 --> 1:48:48.400]  really answer why he wasn't sure uh what kind of made me feel a little bit disappointed in ron paul
[1:48:48.400 --> 1:48:52.560]  honestly well you know that we've gotten that a lot you know and a lot of people are disappointed
[1:48:52.560 --> 1:48:57.760]  that he wasn't the 9 11 truth candidate this is what i say about it he started a campaign for
[1:48:57.760 --> 1:49:03.360]  liberty dot org right now all right let's see if he gets some people elected number two on his
[1:49:03.360 --> 1:49:09.440]  campaign he really ran on a campaign that would have almost circumvented 9 11 and gone after our
[1:49:09.440 --> 1:49:14.560]  true globalist masters which are which are the international banking cartel really you know if
[1:49:14.560 --> 1:49:20.960]  he was able to do something against the fed that is so far beyond uh 9 11 truth that i i think
[1:49:20.960 --> 1:49:27.200]  that uh he was playing it smart am i frustrated a lot sure man i'm i'm frustrated a lot too
[1:49:27.200 --> 1:49:33.520]  i think that uh obviously he says a lot less than he knows you know he plays politics some
[1:49:33.520 --> 1:49:39.120]  of the time but he is a politician continue well i i just thought it was interesting that
[1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:44.080]  the uh fill in host i don't even know i've never seen the guy before but he was so
[1:49:44.080 --> 1:49:49.920]  willing to bring up these very specific things it made me kind of get that jolt of excitement
[1:49:49.920 --> 1:49:55.920]  you know like wow that's pretty i mean i think somebody should go get that and uh maybe you
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:50:01.920]  have to find some use for it because it was pretty blatant that he was uh take the conversation there
[1:50:01.920 --> 1:50:06.320]  and the first thing i thought about it you know this is having this is having an impact i mean
[1:50:06.320 --> 1:50:11.440]  it's it's you know from all these different little corners you're starting to hear things start to
[1:50:11.440 --> 1:50:16.320]  seep in listen there's no doubt that we're having an impact it's the mainstream media that is uh
[1:50:16.320 --> 1:50:21.360]  putting this illusion over all of us even within the movement that we are being that we're marginal
[1:50:21.360 --> 1:50:26.640]  man we have great power i mean look how much money we raised for ron paul they know that we're
[1:50:26.640 --> 1:50:32.320]  hip to their tricks 36 percent in a script power poll believe 9-11 was an inside job 84 percent
[1:50:32.320 --> 1:50:36.560]  don't believe the official version it's the alex joneshow i thank you for the call we'll be back
[1:50:36.560 --> 1:50:53.920]  after this info wars dot com our beloved republic is on her knees the forces of globalism are

[1:57:25.840 --> 1:57:30.880]  inability for us to freely communicate the facts to allow us to decide for ourselves who's good

[1:57:51.200 --> 1:57:58.160]  in uncertainty and we can help them by uh letting everybody understand in america if you accuse
[1:57:58.160 --> 1:58:04.320]  somebody of a criminal offense without any evidence you're an enemy of all three peoples
[1:58:04.320 --> 1:58:10.320]  okay so so bush has given you no evidence closed with investigations and to suggest he's anything

[2:01:08.240 --> 2:01:17.760]  north carolina what's up renay you with us renay yes yeah yeah um well um you know i i believe that
[2:01:17.760 --> 2:01:24.880]  the the professional class is used to control the rest of the classes and they have to have a way
[2:01:24.880 --> 2:01:30.800]  for these people to not really understand what they're doing so they don't feel guilty about it okay
[2:01:30.800 --> 2:01:36.160]  and i've noticed in my lifetime is observing the people in medicine law government and stuff
[2:01:36.960 --> 2:01:44.320]  um this is this is what they do now the definition of a sociopath is someone who lacks empathy but
[2:01:44.320 --> 2:01:50.080]  but when people move into these professions if they show too much empathy to the very people
[2:01:50.080 --> 2:01:58.480]  they're supposed to care about they're usually um kind of admonished for this and told that they're
[2:01:58.480 --> 2:02:06.560]  displaying a lack of professionalism they're talk to believe to equate being detached and and lacking
[2:02:06.560 --> 2:02:13.040]  empathy to being a good professional you know we have to expose this and because i think a lot of
[2:02:13.040 --> 2:02:20.000]  these people if they actually saw what they were doing they might stop it because they are the people
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:27.120]  in the middle of the pyramid who are controlling the lower part of the pyramid in exchange for
[2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:34.240]  a little extra power and perks and you see that the top of the pyramid needs them they need somebody
[2:02:34.240 --> 2:02:39.840]  to control the masses because their numbers are too small well i agree and they're they're the
[2:02:39.840 --> 2:02:44.720]  compartmentalized group that uh doesn't always know the agenda and in fact most cases don't know
[2:02:44.720 --> 2:02:49.200]  the agenda and they live in a nice house and they're able to afford their luxury automobile and the
[2:02:49.200 --> 2:02:54.080]  second car and send their kids to college and not give it much thought and take a vacation in the
[2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:58.640]  summer so you know a lot of them are extra blinded i i uh totally and completely agree with you i
[2:02:58.640 --> 2:03:03.600]  thank you for the call i mean let's reach out to them as well i i have no problem talking to my bosses
[2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:08.640]  and handing them dvds and you know those are the yuppies they think they're part of the elite but
[2:03:08.640 --> 2:03:13.360]  in in fact they're just another mode of control and uh when they start to lose the house when
[2:03:13.360 --> 2:03:18.000]  there's a true depression in this country i think that class is going to be wiped out the upper middle
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:23.040]  class i think gone i think we're going to see a a larger and larger separation of the poor
[2:03:23.040 --> 2:03:28.320]  and uh the haves and the haves not i guess not even the poor and the rich because the rich will just
[2:03:28.320 --> 2:03:34.720]  become super rich and the middle class will be further eradicated and we'll just fall into more
[2:03:34.720 --> 2:03:40.640]  serfdom you know the new freedom good times all right let's go to chris in utah chris what's happening

[2:10:12.880 --> 2:10:18.800]  issues so we're very very active and we've had a great deal of interest already expressed in our
[2:10:18.800 --> 2:10:22.400]  new organization well look i think it's great i spent a lot of time talking to college kids who
[2:10:22.400 --> 2:10:26.000]  are looking around going isn't the government supposed to feed cloth house me and change my
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:30.160]  diaper for me so i love the idea of college kids out fighting for liberty my question for you and
[2:10:30.160 --> 2:10:33.760]  i always have a question for all libertarians i've asked this before congressman what makes you
[2:10:33.760 --> 2:10:39.360]  believe that americans want more liberty don't these gen xers and their please take care of me
[2:10:39.360 --> 2:10:44.960]  mentality really reflect where sadly america is today well you know there's a contest going on
[2:10:44.960 --> 2:10:49.680]  those who want to be taken care of by others and the using government force to do it and
[2:10:49.680 --> 2:10:54.640]  and those of us who say that we should be responsible take care of ourselves a year and
[2:10:54.640 --> 2:10:59.360]  a half ago when i was reluctant to join the presidential race i was convinced that nobody
[2:10:59.360 --> 2:11:04.560]  would listen nobody cared we needed another generation we needed a disaster to wake up people
[2:11:04.560 --> 2:11:09.760]  but i'll tell you what in the last year so i have been very encouraged by the number of young people
[2:11:09.760 --> 2:11:16.560]  they come to my office endlessly talking about self-reliance and responsibility so i am very
[2:11:16.560 --> 2:11:21.120]  encouraged and i think it's the need i think it's the obvious evidence the government doesn't work
[2:11:21.120 --> 2:11:26.320]  the foreign policies and shambles the spending is too high and uh the young people know they're
[2:11:26.320 --> 2:11:30.000]  getting the bill and that's why i think they're waking up you know congressman paul i would love
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:34.400]  to believe you i want to live in america that's a lot more like the one that you want self-reliance
[2:11:34.400 --> 2:11:38.240]  and i see it for example in iowa where the flood striking people rush out and they help their
[2:11:38.240 --> 2:11:42.080]  neighbors they help themselves well let's face it love america lives in new orleans people sitting
[2:11:42.080 --> 2:11:47.680]  around flooded waiting please come get me can you give an example of where you see liberty winning
[2:11:47.680 --> 2:11:52.800]  in the public debate today here in the united states well i think we won the argument with uh
[2:11:52.800 --> 2:11:57.760]  with new orleans government totally failed and uh people are waking up they can't depend on the
[2:11:57.760 --> 2:12:01.760]  government so no i think it is difficult and there's a lot of people who think government
[2:12:01.760 --> 2:12:08.000]  can bail them out but the government's running out of money resources and ability and it's going
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:13.920]  to end you know i complain about us being in uh 130 country and 700 bases but that's going to come
[2:12:13.920 --> 2:12:17.520]  to an end not because i'm going to persuade everybody but we're going to run out of money
[2:12:17.520 --> 2:12:22.800]  we're going to ruin our dollar and uh we'll have to cut back we'll have to live with our means
[2:12:22.800 --> 2:12:26.560]  but the big decision is is whether it's going to be the society you and i would like to have
[2:12:26.560 --> 2:12:30.880]  with less government self-reliance and following the constitution or whether we're going to accept
[2:12:30.880 --> 2:12:35.360]  this notion that the government's going to save us well obviously the government can't save us
[2:12:35.360 --> 2:12:40.240]  because the government is is nobody they can't create jobs and they can't create wealth and as
[2:12:40.240 --> 2:12:44.640]  soon as we wake up the better i want to get to a political uh stories in the presidential race
[2:12:44.640 --> 2:12:49.760]  and second one lesson you mentioned oil prices in your view it seems to me it's classic libertarian
[2:12:49.760 --> 2:12:54.800]  supply and demand am i missing something here on why the price is so high yeah but there's another
[2:12:54.800 --> 2:12:59.360]  addition to that there's a supply and demand of energy but that is not our problem you can get
[2:12:59.360 --> 2:13:04.480]  all the oil and gasoline you want at the gas station today but every the reason there's a problem
[2:13:04.480 --> 2:13:09.760]  is the price is too high so they don't talk about the supply and demand of dollars the supply of
[2:13:09.760 --> 2:13:15.920]  dollars is too much and that's why uh that the dollar the gasoline prices are going up also the
[2:13:15.920 --> 2:13:21.520]  foreign policy of our intervention in the middle east has been a fear factor and there's danger
[2:13:21.520 --> 2:13:25.120]  over there and that has pushed the prices up they're up over a hundred dollars since we've
[2:13:25.120 --> 2:13:31.200]  invaded iraq so that is a factor nobody really wants to talk about that but the cost of gasoline
[2:13:31.200 --> 2:13:35.280]  is up because the value of the dollar is down i want to speak about foreign policy for a second
[2:13:35.280 --> 2:13:38.480]  because you and i disagree on foreign policy you know having a loony tune likes that i'm
[2:13:38.480 --> 2:13:42.560]  saying running around threatening his neighbors was never good for ass prices you add china and
[2:13:42.560 --> 2:13:46.640]  india's demand and the tight supply to a loony tune likes that i'm saying i've got a problem
[2:13:46.640 --> 2:13:49.920]  but i have to ask you this because i think it's it's a necessary question so many of your supporters
[2:13:49.920 --> 2:13:54.480]  i mean are also part of the nine eleven truth movement you've appeared in a movie end game that
[2:13:54.480 --> 2:13:59.200]  talks about the builder burgers etc why do you think there is such an attraction from that part
[2:13:59.200 --> 2:14:05.120]  of the political discourse to your movement well i'm not sure and one of the reasons is that though
[2:14:05.120 --> 2:14:12.960]  i don't endorse those those concerns i probably have you know uh encourage it in uh ironically
[2:14:12.960 --> 2:14:19.680]  because i haven't accepted the uh nine eleven uh investigation you haven't no because i i think
[2:14:19.680 --> 2:14:24.720]  they hid things from us and they didn't want to blame anybody nobody was discovered to be in
[2:14:24.720 --> 2:14:30.800]  that we spent 40 billion dollars on security and and the information was there what about the cia
[2:14:30.800 --> 2:14:36.160]  agents that reported 35 or 40 times that these individuals were flying airplanes but learning
[2:14:36.160 --> 2:14:40.240]  how to fly airplanes but not land them and we didn't do anything but nobody was punished so
[2:14:40.240 --> 2:14:45.280]  there was a lot of ineptness there on that and nobody talks about the incentives for people
[2:14:45.280 --> 2:14:50.240]  to commit suicide terrorism and it's very very clear that suicide terrorists are not motivated
[2:14:50.240 --> 2:14:56.320]  because people are rich or because they're free they're motivated mainly and almost wholeheartedly
[2:14:56.320 --> 2:15:00.640]  because they are occupied by foreign nations and if we don't understand that we are going to be
[2:15:00.640 --> 2:15:04.560]  forever threatened by terrorists once again i disagree with you but are you seeing there's
[2:15:04.560 --> 2:15:08.880]  something about the nine eleven attack that we should know but don't i thought we know 19 guys
[2:15:08.880 --> 2:15:13.520]  airplanes slammed into the buildings what don't we know well what we don't know is who was in
[2:15:13.520 --> 2:15:19.280] ept we had that information uh buried in all those records that uh some of these people were
[2:15:19.280 --> 2:15:24.240]  stirring around we didn't do anything to prevent it i mean we had all this money spent to protect
[2:15:24.240 --> 2:15:30.400]  us on that day on nine eleven sold korea was better protected than washington dc in new york
[2:15:30.400 --> 2:15:36.400]  city so there's something wrong we're looking outward not inward we closed down bases in our in
[2:15:36.400 --> 2:15:42.240]  america and we built them in saudi arabia which was the number one motivating factor of osama
[2:15:42.240 --> 2:15:47.920]  ben laudan he says you have a military base by foreigners on our holy land so we have to understand
[2:15:47.920 --> 2:15:51.440]  that if not there's no way we can solve this well and of course we were there because of the threat
[2:15:51.440 --> 2:15:54.240]  of sodoma saying which takes us back to the beginning but congressman i've got to take a
[2:15:54.240 --> 2:15:59.040]  quick break i'd love to continue this conversation when we return more with congressman ron paul
[2:15:59.040 --> 2:16:03.680]  all right folks i uh i don't know what's on the other side but uh there you have it there's uh
[2:16:04.240 --> 2:16:10.720]  paul's uh nine eleven ineptness at least he uh brings up the fact that we definitely had prior
[2:16:10.720 --> 2:16:16.960]  knowledge in that uh clip again we know that kasenich actually 33rd article of impeachment
[2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:23.840]  was uh failure to act on warnings and then 34th was the cover-up aspect of nine eleven in the
[2:16:23.840 --> 2:16:28.240]  nine eleven commission he brought up the fact that dick chaney and george bush testified
[2:16:28.240 --> 2:16:32.720]  together not under oath with no record of their conversation between only two members of the
[2:16:32.720 --> 2:16:38.400]  commission all right let's jump to the next caller i think that we are at joe in texas are we at joe
[2:16:38.400 --> 2:16:45.680]  joe you're with us joe all right oh we have christen florida first all right let's go to chris
[2:16:45.680 --> 2:16:52.640]  what's up chris hey jason hey that was a hard act to follow ron paul my god um what i wanted to call
[2:16:52.640 --> 2:17:00.720]  about was um to my horror and amazement i read on prison planet just this morning uh bogartone
[2:17:00.720 --> 2:17:07.680]  proposes city-wide surveillance system um this system is going to link the traffic cameras the
[2:17:07.680 --> 2:17:13.280]  public building cameras and possibly those on private property and i figured i'd call in
[2:17:13.280 --> 2:17:22.480]  since i i live here and um it's a very relatively safe town well did you hear about miami implementing
[2:17:22.480 --> 2:17:29.360]  the use of uavs with cameras on them recently i think i did i was born in miami and um i was
[2:17:29.360 --> 2:17:34.720]  going to say if any town you know kind of would maybe warrant you know this kind of i mean this is
[2:17:34.720 --> 2:17:40.160]  this unbelievable now that is unbelievable and miami is like the drug running town too i mean
[2:17:40.160 --> 2:17:45.200]  i've been to miami i'm not a big fan of it but uh if there is one town that has a ton of crime
[2:17:45.200 --> 2:17:50.640]  and a ton of blow quite frankly it would be miami but i don't think that's a reason to implement
[2:17:50.640 --> 2:17:56.160]  these uavs or a system like that especially because when it when it usually it comes down to it we're
[2:17:56.160 --> 2:18:01.360]  the ones shipping the uh drugs into florida absolutely and i don't think it's warranted at
[2:18:01.360 --> 2:18:08.560]  all and next now i'm ready for it to uh you know this is 1984 i mean cameras linked all over the
[2:18:08.560 --> 2:18:16.320]  city i mean visitor retirement community with the other half being a bunch of affluent you know people
[2:18:16.880 --> 2:18:23.120]  we have had some high profile crimes here and we just recently this came on the heels of and it's
[2:18:23.120 --> 2:18:32.160]  mentioned in the article of a mother and a daughter i think it was who were taken from the local mall
[2:18:32.960 --> 2:18:39.200]  and driven around and then murdered but you know those are the kind of crimes that that happen you
[2:18:39.200 --> 2:18:46.320]  know they're they're you know high profile crimes that happen and i think they've used that to institute
[2:18:46.320 --> 2:18:52.000]  this absolutely i mean it's always the excuse is they take legitimate criminals but the thing is it
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:57.520]  never stops crime all it does is squelch down on the population i i thank for the call chris
[2:18:57.520 --> 2:19:01.760]  and uh you know it's just like nobody wants kids to be abducted except for maybe the elites and
[2:19:01.760 --> 2:19:06.720]  some sickos out there but they use that to implement the amber alert system you know where
[2:19:06.720 --> 2:19:12.400]  they can have checkpoints and illegal search and seizure and your papers please and uh they use
[2:19:12.400 --> 2:19:17.360]  legitimate crimes and issues in order to implement their police state measures and we're only going
[2:19:17.360 --> 2:19:23.440]  to see more of it that's why we got to get out there and fight the system it's the alex jones show

[2:24:20.640 --> 2:24:27.680]  foxnews.com and i believe this is fog that's uh getting all in it all in a tuss critics are calling
[2:24:27.680 --> 2:24:31.840]  for the resignation of a you an official who publicly supports investigating theories that the
[2:24:31.840 --> 2:24:38.240]  september 11 attacks on the world trade center and pentagon were an inside job richard fox the
[2:24:38.240 --> 2:24:44.960]  special uh i don't know again rapper torra of human rights and palestinian territories
[2:24:44.960 --> 2:24:50.320]  investigates alleged israeli violations of human rights law for the un's human rights council
[2:24:51.040 --> 2:24:54.960]  but the former princeton professor would also like to investigate whether some of the controlled
[2:24:54.960 --> 2:25:01.840]  explosions from within destroyed the twin towers he told foxnews.com i do think there are questions
[2:25:01.840 --> 2:25:06.560]  that have not been answered questions about the way the buildings collapsed and the failure uh
[2:25:07.280 --> 2:25:14.080]  to heed a variety of signals where the danger was coming and of course this one's who's this
[2:25:14.080 --> 2:25:21.520]  from bolton yeah john bolton pure scumbag i think is believes a fruitcake city but among many
[2:25:21.520 --> 2:25:26.640]  delegations of the un it's probably the conventional wisdom so he admits that a lot of people in the
[2:25:26.640 --> 2:25:32.240]  un know it's an inside job they just don't have spine like fox so he'll just attack fox that's
[2:25:32.240 --> 2:25:39.680]  nice good for him way to attack the one guy going public fox news thank you john bolton yeah there's
[2:25:39.680 --> 2:25:45.120]  a big criminal i don't even know why is it that some people within the movement especially the
[2:25:45.120 --> 2:25:49.600]  anti war movement want to cow down to these people want to ask their permission don't ask
[2:25:49.600 --> 2:25:55.600]  their permission don't worship them they're not your lords wake up on the same thing with that
[2:25:55.600 --> 2:26:00.800]  richard clark fella you know he's on this uh building seven documentary guaranteeing there
[2:26:00.800 --> 2:26:04.960]  was no bombs in building seven it was not a controlled demolition oh and you're in the
[2:26:04.960 --> 2:26:10.240]  position to know richard clark you can't look at that building and look at the evidence and
[2:26:10.240 --> 2:26:14.480]  come to the logical conclusion no you're going to tow the party line like the scumbag you are
[2:26:14.480 --> 2:26:21.760]  yeah richard clark's a real asset to this movement please scum total and complete scum
[2:26:22.640 --> 2:26:28.000]  all right now we're going to go to joan texas joe are you with me hey jason how's it going
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:34.800]  good man what's up i'd like to make a suggestion to get michael reagan fired sure and what i've seen
[2:26:34.800 --> 2:26:40.640]  through the websites and the readings of the post on info wars dot com is listings of the affiliates
[2:26:40.640 --> 2:26:45.680]  of the stations they carry michael reagan's broadcast but are there any listings of who
[2:26:45.680 --> 2:26:51.360]  their advertisers sponsors are because a lot of times you know athletes will lose sponsorship if
[2:26:51.360 --> 2:26:56.240]  they say the wrong thing in public and things like that so if you kind of like cut the revenue off
[2:26:56.240 --> 2:27:01.120]  in the bottom and work its way up to the top and people like jim roberts are going to find
[2:27:01.120 --> 2:27:05.680]  themselves out on the street along with michael reagan it's a great idea i would say you'd probably
[2:27:05.680 --> 2:27:10.320]  have to listen to uh unfortunately the michael reagan show on a couple different networks
[2:27:10.320 --> 2:27:14.720]  or put out an email list on a message for the info wars message for it's probably the way to go on
[2:27:14.720 --> 2:27:19.680]  one of those stories find out who they are and massively email them i like that i like that a
[2:27:19.680 --> 2:27:26.160]  lot joe yeah also to cause the scent within the radio america organization this is like
[2:27:26.160 --> 2:27:30.560]  mark dice is doing out there with the military where he causes the scent by showing the truth
[2:27:30.560 --> 2:27:37.120]  of what's really happening if we go to a lower level people who are out there within the organization
[2:27:37.120 --> 2:27:42.560]  anywhere from the administrative staff on up they start hating their job they start hating
[2:27:42.560 --> 2:27:47.520]  their bosses they start hating who they're working for they start hating michael reagan jim roberts
[2:27:47.520 --> 2:27:52.720]  who are these guys letting michael reagan save these these things on the radio you know they
[2:27:52.720 --> 2:27:57.440]  start losing people and losing the scent that way and i'm with you man i mean i was very encouraged
[2:27:57.440 --> 2:28:02.720]  by that caller out of kentucky today that was a special forces guy that you know says yeah it's
[2:28:02.720 --> 2:28:06.800]  great that we're telling the troops and he's on our side and he's talking to other troops to just

[2:34:30.880 --> 2:34:34.800]  indiana well perry i know if that you believe you can make a change you can make a change in the
[2:34:34.800 --> 2:34:39.600]  first step has been taken by uh you know forming that organization i thank you very much for the
[2:34:39.600 --> 2:34:44.880]  call see folks it's up to us we can make a difference and this uh also lets me know that we can make
[2:34:44.880 --> 2:34:50.880]  a difference this was posted yesterday uh buzzflash has given their media putts of the week award to
[2:34:50.880 --> 2:34:56.240]  michael reagan and i guess they're not the only one who's picked up on this randy rhodes who does a
[2:34:56.240 --> 2:35:00.160]  awfully good radio show over at air america i don't agree with everything but she talks about
[2:35:00.160 --> 2:35:05.040]  a lot of the things we talk about on this program and she brought up the mark day situation let's
[2:35:05.040 --> 2:35:10.320]  read it for reporting that that is an embarrassment to the profession of journalism and for being
[2:35:10.320 --> 2:35:17.680]  beholden to corporate paymasters rather than the citizens of america sadly ironic that we just finished
[2:35:17.680 --> 2:35:22.720]  interviewing rory o'connor about his new book on right wing radio hate mongers when we heard murder
[2:35:22.720 --> 2:35:28.320]  heard a murderous rant by michael reagan played on played and condemned on the randy rhodes show
[2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:33.760]  as we listened to reagan's audio on randy's program this week we were reminded that all of this right
[2:35:33.760 --> 2:35:39.520]  wing talk of killing hate and violence is being broadcast on public airwaves and enriching the
[2:35:39.520 --> 2:35:46.800]  wealthy purveyors of an on-air demagoguery and remember there are corporations who make a profit
[2:35:46.800 --> 2:35:51.120]  from this destruction from these destructive words as well as advertisers who support the
[2:35:51.120 --> 2:35:55.840]  degrading of the most basic of civilized standards that ties in with the caller who wants to go after
[2:35:57.760 --> 2:36:04.320]  uh go after the advertisers that's the way to go we read that just recently reagan said that an
[2:36:04.320 --> 2:36:09.840]  individual who is writing soldiers about his concerns about 9 11 should be shot we ought to
[2:36:09.840 --> 2:36:14.560]  find these people who are doing this take them out and shoot them really you take them out
[2:36:14.560 --> 2:36:19.840]  they're traitors to this country and shoot them you have a problem with that deal with it you shoot
[2:36:19.840 --> 2:36:25.760]  them you call them traitors and that's what they are and you shoot them dead i'll pay for the bullets
[2:36:25.760 --> 2:36:31.120]  right there advocating for our murders thanks michael how about you take mark dice
[2:36:31.120 --> 2:36:36.000]  put him out in the middle of the firing range time to a post don't blindfold him let him rip and have
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:42.160]  some fun with mark dice then a youtube posting of michael reagan's broadcast from a couple of years
[2:36:42.160 --> 2:36:47.520]  ago finally got noticed where he made genocidal threats against muslim baby babies and mothers
[2:36:47.520 --> 2:36:51.360]  because of the middle eastern mother naming her child hezbollah you know what i would get
[2:36:51.360 --> 2:36:58.160]  it for its first birthday i would put a grenade up their butts and light it happy birthday bye bye
[2:36:58.160 --> 2:37:03.680]  bye bye yeah the murder of babies he's a real good guy he went on to say what's wrong with
[2:37:03.680 --> 2:37:09.280]  killing the mothers and the babies it only gets more macabre and definitely homicidal from there
[2:37:09.280 --> 2:37:15.040]  since the radio program was simulcast on cable you can see reagan as he is spouting this ss diatribe
[2:37:15.040 --> 2:37:21.040]  and he is smirking for the cameras these shock jocks radio stormtroopers of the right know that
[2:37:21.040 --> 2:37:25.760]  outrageous comments get attention and publicity and ultimately bigger checks for their bank account
[2:37:25.760 --> 2:37:30.960]  but they and their radio company owners and their corporate sponsors are violent violating
[2:37:30.960 --> 2:37:36.560]  fundamental decency it is difficult and frustrating to try and fathom how we have arrived at this
[2:37:36.560 --> 2:37:41.520]  point in our society when the public airwaves are filled with such vile filth and violent calls
[2:37:41.520 --> 2:37:48.480]  for murder also readily tolerated by the right wing dial of course they are michael reagan is not
[2:37:48.480 --> 2:37:54.000]  just a buzz flash media player of the week he is a contemptible human being who puts our nation's
[2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:59.760]  integrity and moral standards to shame agreed and thanks for the coverage remember operation
[2:37:59.760 --> 2:38:05.200]  informed the soldiers still in full force and uh you can still go to mark dice dot com and get
[2:38:05.200 --> 2:38:11.840]  all the info to contact radio america and the president jim roberts all right let's keep going
[2:38:11.840 --> 2:38:18.320]  through these calls let's go to ian in canada what's happening ian uh thank you jason um i
[2:38:18.320 --> 2:38:22.720]  wanted to address something it's been so hard to get through i wanted to answer something that
[2:38:22.720 --> 2:38:27.920]  governor jesse ventura said a few weeks ago but apropos what you just said about michael reagan
[2:38:27.920 --> 2:38:33.680]  you might be interested in an altercation i had with a leading producer in the canadian television
[2:38:33.680 --> 2:38:39.520]  entertainment industry who over the christmas holidays at his family's house had a hissy denial
[2:38:39.520 --> 2:38:46.720]  fit about the facts of 9 11 and uh through a storm of all sorts of obscenities he stopped
[2:38:46.720 --> 2:38:53.440]  looked me straight in the eye and he said okay maybe they did it but if they did do it it's
[2:38:53.440 --> 2:38:58.960]  a done deal and you just got to live with it now that's typical that's a noam chomsky
[2:38:58.960 --> 2:39:03.280]  that's a noam chomsky response right there ultimately it doesn't ultimately it doesn't
[2:39:03.280 --> 2:39:08.800]  matter even though our entire foreign and domestic policy is based on it and this goes to jesse
[2:39:08.800 --> 2:39:13.600]  ventura's comment i'm on the same page with governor ventura on most things but he said
[2:39:13.600 --> 2:39:19.760]  that same-sex marriage was none of his business um it seems to be that his uh idea that it's a
[2:39:19.760 --> 2:39:25.280]  libertarian position but i think one of the reasons they pulled off 9 11 is that they know that the
[2:39:25.280 --> 2:39:31.920]  critical thinking skills of the population at large are shot um governor ventura has got to
[2:39:31.920 --> 2:39:39.520]  remember that it's not just a special government approved friendship between two people marriage
[2:39:39.520 --> 2:39:43.840]  is a covenant where there are three parties some would say god's the first party and the bride and
[2:39:43.840 --> 2:39:49.360]  groom are the second party we you and me and the family and community are the third party who
[2:39:49.360 --> 2:39:55.120]  witnessed the event and at least are required to recognize by law the integrity and sanctity of the
[2:39:55.120 --> 2:40:02.000]  event same-sex marriage is not a civil liberty it's a civil fraud it's like a car battery with two
[2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:08.080]  positive terminals it looks like a battery but it's not going to start a car and uh uh i just think
[2:40:08.080 --> 2:40:13.920]  that um i can't understand why people won't think in depth especially venture jesse ventura
[2:40:13.920 --> 2:40:18.000]  all righty and i i thank you for the call man and i i got to tell you i i feel like we need to
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:23.600]  prioritize a little bit heavier i can understand your frustration on the on your uh on the position
[2:40:23.600 --> 2:40:28.800]  of that issue because it is being passed uh throughout personally i do like to stay out of
[2:40:28.800 --> 2:40:33.680]  people's bedrooms but uh you know obviously you're entitled to your opinion and uh we just gave you
[2:40:33.680 --> 2:40:39.760]  your soapbox on it and uh again i i just can't you know i understand why people think that it's
[2:40:39.760 --> 2:40:45.200]  demoralizing to the country and they think that our morality is gone and all this other stuff but
[2:40:45.200 --> 2:40:50.400]  i feel like there's just so many other serious issues like torture domestic wiretapping and of
[2:40:50.400 --> 2:40:55.920]  the loss of of liberties so you know i i'm not saying i agree with ventura on his position
[2:40:55.920 --> 2:40:59.680]  but uh i'm definitely not going to go out against it all right let's pop to another uh
[2:40:59.680 --> 2:41:07.040]  collie let's go to francis in florida what's up francis can you hear me yes sir um i'm not real
[2:41:07.040 --> 2:41:13.600]  good with websites or anything of that nature to build one but um can i ask two questions or
[2:41:13.600 --> 2:41:21.120]  actually ask one sure and then make a comment about something else okay go ahead um have you
[2:41:21.120 --> 2:41:28.800]  ever heard of uh this guy benjamin fulford f u l it's been on the show sure he's uh he's a former uh
[2:41:28.800 --> 2:41:33.760]  i think he used to write for forbs and uh he's a former reporter there but he spends a lot of
[2:41:33.760 --> 2:41:40.000]  time over in uh japan and he got that interview with uh david rockfeller recently and uh he
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:44.720]  did a couple hours on jones's show i want to say two or three months ago that you might be able to
[2:41:44.720 --> 2:41:54.880]  find the archives okay um now this is what point i would like to make we talk about taking back
[2:41:54.880 --> 2:42:02.800]  the country yeah but not everyone it seems to be on the same page everyone has different issues
[2:42:03.360 --> 2:42:13.040]  sure and issues such as um the nafta highway and the free trade and uh immigration and so on
[2:42:13.040 --> 2:42:20.480]  and so forth there's just there's so many issues but no one's confronting the the issues with
[2:42:20.480 --> 2:42:29.520]  the the politicians and i mean i write letters through the downsize t dc and i tell them i you
[2:42:29.520 --> 2:42:34.080]  know if you if you don't want to do this i'll just get on the bandwagon with everyone else
[2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:38.000]  so we're going to vote you out of there we don't like you we don't like what you're doing to our
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:46.960]  country but if there was one website one place where you can go to every single day and email them
[2:42:46.960 --> 2:42:57.760]  the same letter why don't these two uh presidential nominees talk about the real issues well because
[2:42:57.760 --> 2:43:01.920]  they're not required to because the public doesn't put pressure on them and the only way public is
[2:43:01.920 --> 2:43:06.320]  really going to put pressure on them is not only writing letters and showing up to these events
[2:43:06.320 --> 2:43:11.840]  but ultimately running for office you know i i and i agree with you i agree with you but
[2:43:11.840 --> 2:43:19.200]  but do you do you not think that congress could put pressure on them to say the people of america
[2:43:19.200 --> 2:43:23.600]  want to talk about the issue all right let me let me explain how it works i i know that everybody
[2:43:23.600 --> 2:43:27.440]  thinks that congress is going to save us but there's only a couple members of congress that even talk
[2:43:27.440 --> 2:43:33.280]  about real issues ron paul and uh denis casin is being two of them there's a few scattershot people
[2:43:33.280 --> 2:43:39.040]  in there you know uh bob bar is not that bad i like i like joe biden on some things but not most
[2:43:39.040 --> 2:43:46.560]  now the bottom line is these people make somewhere between 80 000 and 140 000 a year from their job
[2:43:46.560 --> 2:43:51.760]  in congress now in order to get into a elected into congress campaigns run anywhere from the
[2:43:51.760 --> 2:43:56.720]  hundreds of thousands to the millions of dollars now they get this money from the special interests
[2:43:56.720 --> 2:44:01.600]  the lobbyists the lobbyists are the ones that tell them the talking points and they're the ones
[2:44:01.600 --> 2:44:06.240]  that decide whether they're allowed to talk about an issue it's a corporatized government it's a soft
[2:44:06.240 --> 2:44:12.480]  sort of fascism unless we're willing to put good people in there that can live on you know
[2:44:12.480 --> 2:44:17.040]  that just the pay from congress and they don't care about their privatized businesses they're
[2:44:17.040 --> 2:44:21.280]  not millionaires in their private lives often billionaires in their private lives after they
[2:44:21.280 --> 2:44:25.680]  play the game for a while that's how we take the country back i thank you for the call man
[2:44:25.680 --> 2:44:34.880]  let's go to mitch in california what's up mitch yeah talking about websites i like to bring up a
[2:44:34.880 --> 2:44:42.960]  good suggestion here why don't we have a trader list a trader list yes well i think there's a lot of
[2:44:42.960 --> 2:44:50.400]  elected official that is against the basics that we're trying to get back uh-huh it could start
[2:44:50.400 --> 2:44:55.920]  off with just their names and little by little if you've got somebody there willing to add
[2:44:55.920 --> 2:45:02.640]  what this person recently voted on to make them even a stronger trader and a list of
[2:45:02.640 --> 2:45:08.480]  of patriots people we want to keep in now if we can get these on a few of the different
[2:45:08.480 --> 2:45:15.120]  different sites that that the freedom movement is going to the one people and there's a lot
[2:45:15.120 --> 2:45:21.360]  of them out there that don't like to search for themselves oh gee this guy's running for senate
[2:45:21.360 --> 2:45:30.240]  my state he's a trader okay i'm gonna vote against him and so on i mean let's face it in everything
[2:45:30.240 --> 2:45:36.560]  in everything we need leaders i agree but you know what we have to become our own leaders number
[2:45:36.560 --> 2:45:41.040]  one and number two there are those types of websites out there the problem is there aren't
[2:45:41.040 --> 2:45:46.160]  that many big websites in the patriot movement let me tell you it's alex jones's websites info
[2:45:46.160 --> 2:45:50.080]  wars dot com and prison planet dot com are as big as they get in the patriot movement there's
[2:45:50.080 --> 2:45:57.440]  nothing that even comes close let me tell you my small site is about uh i would say anywhere between
[2:45:57.440 --> 2:46:03.200]  25 and 50 times smaller than the traffic that alex gets it's going to take some creative people man
[2:46:03.200 --> 2:46:08.160]  i thank you for the call it's not going to be overnight but i think that uh ron paul's campaign
[2:46:08.160 --> 2:46:13.040]  for liberty dot com is is uh in the right step you know they're trying to get actual officials
[2:46:13.040 --> 2:46:18.560]  elected and uh that's that is the next step in this movement in my opinion let's go to josh
[2:46:18.560 --> 2:46:24.720]  in california what's up josh hey josh mya or jason myon yeah you're on uh cool hey i just wanted
[2:46:24.720 --> 2:46:32.000]  to say uh you're doing great filling in for alex thanks man and uh you know it's it's difficult
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:37.840]  when these people like mike reagan you know who have an actual median to get out and talk to people
[2:46:37.840 --> 2:46:43.200]  and spread information just start spreading all kinds of filth and talking about murder and people
[2:46:43.200 --> 2:46:49.280]  on the air and it just well that's why we need to double and triple our efforts man go to mark
[2:46:49.280 --> 2:46:55.680]  dice dot com right now you can at least send an email out to uh roberts who is the head of radio
[2:46:55.680 --> 2:47:00.000]  america there you can at least call them up i gave out the youtube number if someone wants to
[2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:05.840]  download the podcast uh yesterday there are things we can do i understand that this guy has a venue
[2:47:05.840 --> 2:47:12.560]  that speaks to millions of people in a mainstream uh way you know what i mean he obviously you know
[2:47:12.560 --> 2:47:17.280]  has a voice that's probably bigger than mine but that doesn't mean that if there's a thousand of my
[2:47:17.280 --> 2:47:21.360]  voice out there we can't beat them you know what i'm saying you know there there's definitely power
[2:47:21.360 --> 2:47:27.120]  in numbers and it's the will of the people man if we have the will to make the change if we really
[2:47:27.120 --> 2:47:32.880]  want to live in what ron paul said a society of responsibility upon ourselves and not upon government
[2:47:32.880 --> 2:47:38.400]  we can make that happen is it going to be easy no but i think the first steps have been taken
[2:47:38.400 --> 2:47:41.840]  and we just need to keep pressing on or we're going to succumb to tyranny brother
[2:47:41.840 --> 2:47:48.720]  mm-hmm yeah i mean we've got like thousands of people like here in my town that you know
[2:47:48.720 --> 2:47:54.000]  preach truth and everything that believe that you know 9-11 wasn't investigated properly
[2:47:54.560 --> 2:47:59.520]  and nobody ever gets to hear them well i mean you know when they come out against them
[2:47:59.520 --> 2:48:05.440]  in uh in the un and especially in this country you can understand why there aren't more whistleblowers
[2:48:05.440 --> 2:48:10.160]  there aren't more people demanding the truth i thank you for the call uh let's go to tom in

[2:52:53.520 --> 2:52:58.480]  facing the world in the last 50 years for the last three years the earth has consumed more food than
[2:52:58.480 --> 2:53:02.800]  it has been able to produce and it has now finally caught up with us in the u.s commodities such as
[2:53:02.800 --> 2:53:06.720]  flour and rice are already being rationed and the next rice crop won't be available for another
[2:53:06.720 --> 2:53:11.120]  four to five months it's fall in the southern hemisphere and many countries are short the food
[2:53:11.120 --> 2:53:14.880]  necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities all together

[2:54:51.120 --> 2:54:55.360]  you can only do this for so long before it really takes a toll on it and i gotta tell you what a
[2:54:55.360 --> 2:55:00.480]  great job you're doing as far as moving through collars and keeping your priorities thanks man
[2:55:01.040 --> 2:55:08.320]  that that's very impressive i can tell you i i used to be a hemp activist in the 90s i'm about
[2:55:08.320 --> 2:55:12.320]  ten years older than alex i'm guessing you're younger yeah i'm a little bit younger only like
[2:55:12.320 --> 2:55:17.760]  five years younger than alex but and i'm about ten years older but it was in my early 30s i
[2:55:17.760 --> 2:55:22.000]  realized you know i was a hemp activist i traveled to every state east of the rocky
[2:55:22.640 --> 2:55:27.680]  preach in hemp thinking that that was the government achilles heel think about it you know

[2:55:32.560 --> 2:55:41.440]  and so we need to keep our focus which is why i recently joined the aclu and i don't agree with
[2:55:41.440 --> 2:55:47.440]  everything they do either but they're about the constitution uh... i would encourage everyone
[2:55:47.440 --> 2:55:54.080]  to call their local you know their uh... federal representatives to sign on to uh...
[2:55:54.080 --> 2:55:59.840]  dennis kucinich's impeachment thing absolutely they should sign that resolution and uh...

[2:56:03.200 --> 2:56:10.080]  calling next time i'm in there but yeah man i mean we can affect change it's just on what level i
[2:56:10.080 --> 2:56:14.400]  mean if you don't want to make the phone call write a letter if you're sick of writing letters and
[2:56:14.400 --> 2:56:17.760]  making phone calls because they're not having the right effect well then maybe you should
[2:56:17.760 --> 2:56:22.480]  join someone's campaign and help support them that way go to the office ten or fifteen hours a week
[2:56:22.480 --> 2:56:28.880]  if you want to make the real big decision and you said you've had enough run for office all right

[3:00:00.720 --> 3:00:04.880]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[3:00:10.640 --> 3:00:15.280]  well for the next 20 minutes we have presidential candidate running as an independent not as a
[3:00:15.280 --> 3:00:24.720]  green this time ralph nader famous anti-corruption consumer advocate and he is with us now running
[3:00:24.720 --> 3:00:30.640]  for president uh the democrats could argue that you know it was bad for him to run as a green and
[3:00:30.640 --> 3:00:36.160]  maybe it may not go or lose or this or that uh or some other candidate but in the final equation
[3:00:36.160 --> 3:00:42.800]  now what difference is there with barack obama and uh john mccain and will uh ask ralph nader his
[3:00:42.800 --> 3:00:47.840]  take on that talk about his campaign and what his party platform is running as an independent
[3:00:47.840 --> 3:00:53.200]  mr nadir thank you for spending time with us thank you alex thank you listeners uh what's most
[3:00:53.200 --> 3:00:58.720]  important for my listeners to know uh and why are you running for president well we need someone
[3:00:58.720 --> 3:01:03.760]  who has stood for the people and not for big business and their government minions in washington
[3:01:04.320 --> 3:01:09.920]  and it's quite clear after working here for so many years that every department agency in washington
[3:01:09.920 --> 3:01:15.280]  dc is overwhelmingly controlled by corporate power the big banks and financial institutions
[3:01:15.280 --> 3:01:20.560]  controlled department treasury and the federal reserve the big defense manufacturers control
[3:01:20.560 --> 3:01:25.120]  the department of defense more more than the people there is not much left for people to
[3:01:25.120 --> 3:01:30.880]  decide anymore alex not much left at all the constitution still starts with we the people
[3:01:30.880 --> 3:01:37.360]  but the way the judges are reading it sounds more like we the corporation is a website vote nadir
[3:01:37.360 --> 3:01:43.120]  dot org and i really urge you to connect with that vibrant website from time to time folks
[3:01:43.120 --> 3:01:47.760]  and also regardless of where you're going to vote or who you're going to vote for uh log into our
[3:01:47.760 --> 3:01:54.640]  uh email uh at vote nadir dot org and you'll get regular uh missives and announcements so it gives
[3:01:54.640 --> 3:02:00.800]  you a different take than uh the mainstream media does on the presidential campaign sir but uh we
[3:02:00.800 --> 3:02:08.000]  want um the the thing is this uh people who believe the taxpayer dollar is a sacred trust
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:13.920]  have got to challenge the waste in washington and the biggest waste is in that bloated wasteful
[3:02:13.920 --> 3:02:19.680]  military budget that now takes one half of the federal government's complete operating expenditures
[3:02:19.680 --> 3:02:26.480]  and there's no more so the union so it's obviously a huge contract bonanza for these big defense
[3:02:26.480 --> 3:02:32.640]  companies whose lobbies swarm over washington whose political acting committees cash register
[3:02:32.640 --> 3:02:39.120]  politics and his executives go into the pentagon uh telling generals and admirals uh what they can
[3:02:39.120 --> 3:02:45.200]  do uh at the top mr nadir i want to go back to what you first said you know describing how global
[3:02:45.200 --> 3:02:49.920]  corporations have come in and taken over the decision-making process of government to where
[3:02:49.920 --> 3:02:55.360]  government is just their vehicle how would you describe that that system is that fascism yeah
[3:02:55.360 --> 3:03:01.440]  well frankendale rosevelt said in 1938 a message to congress he said when our government is taken
[3:03:01.440 --> 3:03:07.520]  over by private economic power that's fascism he used that exact words alex what are you of course
[3:03:07.520 --> 3:03:13.840]  it's never been worse what do you have to do with this campaign well look what we've got to do first
[3:03:13.840 --> 3:03:18.880]  of all these global uh trade agreements are more than trade agreements they basically allow
[3:03:18.880 --> 3:03:25.760]  communists and fascist dictators abroad uh who receive uh the global corporations jobs and industries
[3:03:25.760 --> 3:03:32.480]  and pommel or workers down to 20 30 40 cents an hour etc they allow these fascist and communist
[3:03:32.480 --> 3:03:37.680]  regimes to pull down the standard of living for the american worker that's what the whole point
[3:03:37.680 --> 3:03:45.600]  of naftan w to our it's to open up very low-cost areas abroad and these are dictatorially repressed
[3:03:45.600 --> 3:03:53.760]  uh costs they are not uh market costs in places like china and and uh so they say okay we're open
[3:03:53.760 --> 3:03:59.600]  for business so you know general electric general motors all these companies uh move their industries
[3:03:59.600 --> 3:04:06.320]  uh lay off their workers hollow communities in downtown usa around the country the autrax industry
[3:04:06.320 --> 3:04:11.840]  the auto supply industry you know all moving over there and then they use this hardworking
[3:04:11.840 --> 3:04:17.440]  chinese labor at 30 40 50 cents an hour with modern capital equipment shipped the products back to the
[3:04:17.440 --> 3:04:24.720]  u.s and and uh in the meantime workers and and companies playing by the rules here uh can't compete
[3:04:24.720 --> 3:04:29.840]  and not only that but a lot of the food you're getting especially uh farm bread fish for example
[3:04:29.840 --> 3:04:36.160]  from china is contaminated the blood thinner heparin has just uh uh been documented to 120 uh

[3:07:56.480 --> 3:08:00.720]  wars.com streams just got a behind the scenes for three minutes with Ralph Nader this is our main
[3:08:00.720 --> 3:08:06.240]  final segment within the next 15 minutes right now sir Dennis Kosinich you I know you agree with
[3:08:06.240 --> 3:08:13.120]  on a lot of policies he has successfully defeated a corporate attack on getting back into congress
[3:08:13.120 --> 3:08:18.400]  he now introduced 35 articles of impeachment as you know a what do you think of those 35
[3:08:18.400 --> 3:08:26.960]  articles B are you in support of the impeachment and what can we do to try to support him in that well
[3:08:26.960 --> 3:08:32.160]  not only am I supportive but about three weeks ago I stood in front of the White House with the
[3:08:32.160 --> 3:08:38.320]  terrorists milling around and made a 45 minute case for the impeachment of Bush Cheney or their
[3:08:38.320 --> 3:08:43.360]  resignation the way Nixon Agnew had to resign or their subsequent prosecution once they leave
[3:08:43.360 --> 3:08:49.200]  office I mean there are at least five serious repeated daily high crimes and misdemeanors as
[3:08:49.200 --> 3:08:54.880]  our constitution puts it for impeachment one is a criminal war of aggression against Iraq based on
[3:08:54.880 --> 3:09:00.560]  a platform of lies deceptions and cover-ups that have been hugely documented the second is systemic
[3:09:00.560 --> 3:09:06.320]  torture that violates the U.S. Army field manual federal statutes our constitution in the Geneva
[3:09:06.320 --> 3:09:11.680]  conventions the third is arresting thousands of Americans and throwing them in jail without
[3:09:11.680 --> 3:09:21.360]  preferring charges and allowing them to have attorneys excuse me the fourth is the spying
[3:09:21.360 --> 3:09:26.480]  on thousands of Americans this push is admitted more than once without a judicial warrant that's
[3:09:26.480 --> 3:09:33.200]  a five-year jail term first class felony under the foreign intelligence surveillance act and the
[3:09:33.200 --> 3:09:41.120]  fifth is this outlaw president this King George the fourth has had 800 signing statements signing
[3:09:41.120 --> 3:09:47.280]  bills enacted by Congress and he basically says I'll decide whether or not I'm going to obey them
[3:09:47.280 --> 3:09:51.200]  and that's more signing statements than all the presidents from George Washington
[3:09:51.200 --> 3:09:57.120]  to Clinton put together so all five and they go on every day they're not like Alex not like you
[3:09:57.120 --> 3:10:02.880]  know a one-time Watergate situation not like lying under oath about sex involving Clinton
[3:10:02.880 --> 3:10:07.760]  for which he was impeached and uh I think we should all support Dennis Kucinich you notice
[3:10:07.760 --> 3:10:13.040]  that the mainstream media has pretty much blacked them out and here he is a upstanding
[3:10:13.040 --> 3:10:18.720]  member of the house right on the house floor and they got reporters all over the place and suddenly
[3:10:18.720 --> 3:10:26.000]  they put away their pens huh so it is important to get chairman John Conyers and speaker Nancy
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:32.160]  Pelosi to hold this president vice president accountable for their high crimes and misdemeanors
[3:10:32.160 --> 3:10:37.200]  you know senator Chuck Hagel republican of Nebraska put it very well the other day he said
[3:10:37.200 --> 3:10:43.520]  quote we try to monarchy once but it didn't work Ralph Nader Ralph Nader presidential candidate
[3:10:43.520 --> 3:10:47.200]  is our guest we'll tell you about the websites in the campaign before he leaves us hearing about
[3:10:47.200 --> 3:10:53.360]  by the way Alex yes just to finish I was up in Kennybunkport where the you know the the bushes
[3:10:53.360 --> 3:11:01.200]  have their palatial estate and uh I made the same point on uh impeachment and that's up on our
[3:11:01.200 --> 3:11:07.600]  website vote nader.org anybody who wants to see that statement and across the cove from
[3:11:08.320 --> 3:11:13.680]  the bush family compound uh can look up uh vote nader.org it's been getting a lot of attention
[3:11:13.680 --> 3:11:17.360]  Mr. Nader I've got to ask you a list of questions here first off you've been around a long time
[3:11:17.360 --> 3:11:21.760]  you've seen a lot of corruption one of the foremost corruption fighters out there and we support you
[3:11:21.760 --> 3:11:26.720]  in that but you know in your life studying this and seeing different personalities I mean here's
[3:11:26.720 --> 3:11:32.320]  just one small tiny example uh you have John McCain goes over to England he has hundreds of donors
[3:11:32.320 --> 3:11:37.760]  to a campaign dinner none of them are US citizens they admit it's all felonies the London Guardian
[3:11:37.760 --> 3:11:42.080]  and AP report on it but no other press and John McCain just says I don't care I'll commit crimes
[3:11:42.080 --> 3:11:47.200]  if I want to we have the White House memos with Gonzalez and you seeing they can torture children
[3:11:47.200 --> 3:11:53.360]  with pliers I mean what has happened it's more than just corruption it's like insanity like they're
[3:11:53.360 --> 3:11:58.480]  they're trying to break every rule they're trying even the Nazis didn't admit they tortured people
[3:11:58.480 --> 3:12:02.960]  they just did it in secret I mean the mindset of these people I'm worried they may stage event
[3:12:02.960 --> 3:12:08.080]  they may start another war with Iran I mean they're building FEMA camps that's now in the
[3:12:08.080 --> 3:12:13.520]  newspapers they're they're setting up private death squads I mean I mean can you just speak
[3:12:13.520 --> 3:12:18.080]  to what we've seen what I mean not just the articles of impeachment but just the the total
[3:12:18.080 --> 3:12:21.680]  lawlessness and why you think they're doing it because there's got to be some method to this
[3:12:21.680 --> 3:12:27.040]  or is it just total megalomania lawlessness is the right word this is an outlaw presidency
[3:12:27.760 --> 3:12:32.560]  this is the president thinks he's above the law beyond the law he can do anything he wants he can
[3:12:32.560 --> 3:12:37.760]  arrest and throw in prison anybody he wants he can invade and attack any country in the world that
[3:12:37.760 --> 3:12:42.960]  he wants and he's effectively said that and he can violate any constitutional provision or
[3:12:42.960 --> 3:12:47.920]  federal law that he wants now how does he get away with it because there's no opposition party to
[3:12:47.920 --> 3:12:53.760]  speak of the Democratic party have just lain down on the job they control Congress but they
[3:12:53.760 --> 3:12:58.800]  refuse to have impeachment hearings they even refuse to have hearings on the constitutional
[3:12:58.800 --> 3:13:06.480]  and statutory crimes of the Bush Cheney regime and I noticed a real tone of urgency in your voice
[3:13:06.480 --> 3:13:12.640]  Alec and it's well merited because this is a subversion of everything our founding fathers
[3:13:12.640 --> 3:13:18.160]  ever dreamed up for our country and we we've got to do some about it we've got to contact our
[3:13:18.160 --> 3:13:22.720]  senators and representatives and when they come home in august I mean surround their
[3:13:22.720 --> 3:13:28.000]  auditoriums with protesters say you've got to do something don't tell us that is only six months
[3:13:28.000 --> 3:13:33.280]  and then the police then the police show up and say no protest allowed activists being arrested
[3:13:33.280 --> 3:13:37.680]  everywhere building more prisons everywhere I mean it looks like this regime backed up by the
[3:13:37.680 --> 3:13:44.000]  corporations is going for broke what do you think their end game is well I mean their end game is
[3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:51.360]  a basically corporate fascism that's what it is the the the merger of government and and big
[3:13:51.360 --> 3:13:57.280]  business for criminal purposes and you'll notice that on our website one of the issues on our
[3:13:57.280 --> 3:14:03.120]  table there off the table for Obama McCain is an aggressive crackdown on corporate crime
[3:14:03.120 --> 3:14:08.000]  and corporate subsidies of the taxpayer dollar and you know this corporate crime is looted and
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:13.040]  drained millions of pensions of workers small investors that laid off workers nobody's working
[3:14:13.040 --> 3:14:18.640]  for Enron anymore wall street is a hotbed of crookery and crime and you've got a war criminal in
[3:14:18.640 --> 3:14:24.320]  the White House oh my god it's it's the shocking thing of it is Alec is how much of the American
[3:14:24.320 --> 3:14:28.880]  people going to take well that's my point sir is that is that they attempt they look like they're
[3:14:28.880 --> 3:14:33.600]  accelerating it and and and I'm worried that they'll even leave office I mean are you worried they
[3:14:33.600 --> 3:14:39.280]  might stage something I'm worried they might attack Iran yeah I mean that's it you know that that
[3:14:39.280 --> 3:14:44.880]  way he shuts up the press most of the press he chills out the democrats he stifles dissent
[3:14:44.880 --> 3:14:50.160]  and concentrates more power in in his hands I think the the hope for the country are these
[3:14:50.160 --> 3:14:56.400]  retired generals admirals the national security types the diplomats who have spoken out against
[3:14:56.400 --> 3:15:02.880]  the war but they haven't organized into a powerful lobby against the war against this kind of
[3:15:02.880 --> 3:15:06.720]  criminality although when you talk to them when you read their op-eds and their statements
[3:15:06.720 --> 3:15:12.320]  they're just terrific patriots but they one at a time doesn't do it they got to all organize
[3:15:12.320 --> 3:15:16.640]  and that'll turn congress around let me tell you what you know these heroes and patriots
[3:15:16.640 --> 3:15:21.360]  with the ribbons and where they've served all over the country up against these draft dodgers
[3:15:21.360 --> 3:15:27.440]  called George W. Bush and Dick Cheney it's no contest well it is a going for broke and you're
[3:15:27.440 --> 3:15:31.360]  right there's all these great patriots fighting back against them shifting gears into another
[3:15:31.360 --> 3:15:35.520]  subject GMO I mean I've had the scientists who worked at the companies where all the rats would
[3:15:35.520 --> 3:15:40.000]  die when they get feed them a potato over a few months and then they put that on our table I mean
[3:15:40.000 --> 3:15:44.160]  again it's like the corporations have gone insane I don't mean your mom and poppins listeners I mean
[3:15:44.160 --> 3:15:51.040]  the big fortune one yeah like Monsanto and others what would you do as president against these GMOs
[3:15:51.040 --> 3:16:00.080]  well first of all it's suspend any further GMO foods in the marketplace they are not labeled 95%
[3:16:00.080 --> 3:16:05.520]  of American people when they go to supermarket they've said they want genetically modified foods
[3:16:05.520 --> 3:16:12.480]  in packages and elsewhere labeled and Monsanto says no the people say yes Monsanto wins the people
[3:16:12.480 --> 3:16:18.960]  lose no democracy there also and there's a very good group in Cambridge started by Harvard and
[3:16:18.960 --> 3:16:26.640]  MIT scientists called Council for Responsible Genetics and the website is gene watch dot org
[3:16:26.640 --> 3:16:33.840]  that's G E N E watch dot org you get good information there there's been at least some progress
[3:16:33.840 --> 3:16:41.680]  Congress about the ban employers from deploying DNA information in order to decide whether
[3:16:41.680 --> 3:16:45.440]  higher or fire so that's another issue what about police all over the country under federal
[3:16:45.440 --> 3:16:50.080]  grants taking blood at checkpoints without warrants there's body scanners going in the
[3:16:50.080 --> 3:16:54.560]  airports that literally scan your neck and body and save the images what would you do to that
[3:16:54.560 --> 3:16:58.960]  well I stopped that because first of all there are some things in people's packages that these
[3:16:58.960 --> 3:17:04.560]  body scanners don't catch to begin with and it's amazing how they want to have these body scanners
[3:17:04.560 --> 3:17:10.720]  but the cargo is still very little examined of the passion one out of a hundred of the cargo
[3:17:10.720 --> 3:17:17.200]  ships closing Ralph Nader running for president what is the strategy how do we help force you
[3:17:17.200 --> 3:17:24.240]  into the debates well google at their headquarters the other week wants to do their own debates
[3:17:24.240 --> 3:17:28.720]  and you know with youtube as their subsidiary they can pull it off they want to start one
[3:17:28.720 --> 3:17:34.480]  in the Orleans and they can deliver an audience that doesn't rely on NBC ABC and CBS that's one
[3:17:34.480 --> 3:17:39.920]  and the second is really protest this debate commission you can get to the way to protest
[3:17:39.920 --> 3:17:44.640]  go to the website open debates dot org open debates dot org yeah you want to have this guy

[3:17:50.160 --> 3:17:54.000]  on the debate yeah we have these private corporate hijackings of the process hey listen
[3:17:54.000 --> 3:17:59.040]  here's an idea and i'm sure you've thought of it even if abc cbs fox won't let you in the debates
[3:17:59.040 --> 3:18:03.520]  how about we have the real third party the real independents have a real google debate even if
[3:18:03.520 --> 3:18:09.280]  they won't show up exactly and have empty chairs where they're these cowards are afraid to show up
[3:18:09.280 --> 3:18:15.120]  other western countries have five six people on the debates these guys want it all to themselves
[3:18:15.120 --> 3:18:21.680]  and they own the corporation one minute closing statement we're out of time sir all right uh
[3:18:21.680 --> 3:18:27.920]  for 40 years i've worked for the american people you've got safer cars and we've had drinking water

[3:18:56.720 --> 3:19:02.160]  adopt a security speculation tax on wall street so they can reduce taxes on you as a worker
[3:19:02.160 --> 3:19:08.960]  put an end to the ballot access obstructionism that keeps uh dissent uh from uh getting into the arena
[3:19:08.960 --> 3:19:15.280]  and dissent is the mother of all us and and open up the question is why do corporations as artificial
[3:19:15.280 --> 3:19:21.040]  entities have the same constitutional rights as you real people do and if they continue to do that

[3:33:25.920 --> 3:33:31.600]  nazi germany was it's already fallen to the bush regime and they destroyed our name

[3:33:42.160 --> 3:33:46.640]  being dismantled the leader of the tories resigned yesterday saying that he basically
[3:33:46.640 --> 3:33:51.680]  discovered the government was setting up a dictatorship in england evil is moving across
[3:33:51.680 --> 3:33:56.480]  the face of the world and in the midst of that evil there are incredible patriots who i just get
[3:33:56.480 --> 3:34:03.280]  more and more respect for uh deniz kasinich i have to say really is the leader now against this
[3:34:03.280 --> 3:34:08.960]  tyranny i have to say that ron paul isn't even as strong as he is when it comes to speaking out
[3:34:08.960 --> 3:34:13.920]  ron paul did sign on to the 35 articles of impeachment we salute him for that but i have to
[3:34:13.920 --> 3:34:21.200]  tell you deniz kasinich in this very dark climate has courage that no one else in congress i i've
[3:34:21.200 --> 3:34:28.240]  not seen it and i assure you he needs our prayers because this is a very wicked group and uh the
[3:34:28.240 --> 3:34:37.200]  mainstream media has tried to ignore it cafferty and others on cnn and msnbc with some of the other
[3:34:37.200 --> 3:34:41.040]  shows like countdown with government have been calling for impeachment but not really talking
[3:34:41.040 --> 3:34:46.640]  about the fact uh that deniz kasinich is pushing for it the congressman joins us very busy he's
[3:34:46.640 --> 3:34:53.120]  with us for the next 25 minutes for the rest of this hour you can go to kasinich.house.gov
[3:34:53.120 --> 3:34:58.320]  and read the 35 articles of impeachment you can also go to info wars.com and see the youtube clips
[3:34:58.320 --> 3:35:05.200]  of his speech he gave a few days ago deniz kasinich i just absolutely want to praise what you're
[3:35:05.200 --> 3:35:11.520]  doing uh for the republic it just you really are doing something as you know that takes a lot of
[3:35:11.520 --> 3:35:18.400]  courage. uh alex thank you very much for those kind words and for the honor of being on your show
[3:35:19.520 --> 3:35:27.120]  your listeners are particularly attuned to uh the erosion of democratic principles and what
[3:35:27.120 --> 3:35:37.040]  led me to finally introduce these articles was uh the the totality of the offenses and the uh ongoing
[3:35:37.040 --> 3:35:44.400]  violations and the possibility that we could even end up in another war uh based on lies we
[3:35:44.400 --> 3:35:50.480]  we are losing our country to to lies to erosion of our civil liberties we've moved into direction
[3:35:50.480 --> 3:35:56.880]  as profoundly anti-democratic and congress has a constitutional responsibility to put a check on
[3:35:56.880 --> 3:36:01.280]  an executive abuse of power that's what these articles of impeachment will do and they not only
[3:36:01.280 --> 3:36:08.720]  set an historic uh benchmark for uh and an historic record for uh future generations but they also
[3:36:08.720 --> 3:36:15.760]  send a message to whoever would be the next president that uh such uh usurpations and abuses
[3:36:15.760 --> 3:36:20.720]  are not going to be tolerated congressman just to break down for those that don't know the process
[3:36:20.720 --> 3:36:25.840]  you basically have brought charges to the equivalent of the grand jury which is the house
[3:36:25.840 --> 3:36:31.200]  which will then decide whether or not to indict then it will go to a trial in the senate if
[3:36:31.200 --> 3:36:36.880]  richard nixon who did one one hundredth literally of what bush and his crime syndicate have done
[3:36:36.880 --> 3:36:43.600]  and if clinton deserved for what he did to to be indicted in the house there is no doubt that
[3:36:43.600 --> 3:36:49.200]  george bush and his group of cronies must be indicted just to get our country's name back
[3:36:49.200 --> 3:36:52.640]  and to let the police and military know that what they've been ordered to do is illegal
[3:36:52.640 --> 3:36:57.280]  because now we see the precedent set for all forms of tyranny can you walk through how important
[3:36:57.280 --> 3:37:02.160]  it is that people get behind this process and how do we you know a what has bush and his crime
[3:37:02.160 --> 3:37:07.920]  syndicate done b uh how do we help you get this done alex the first thing that i want to say
[3:37:07.920 --> 3:37:15.600]  after listening to the way that you provided a capsule summary is that um you yourself are someone
[3:37:15.600 --> 3:37:21.600]  who uh needs to be appreciated for your understanding what's happening your willingness to communicate
[3:37:21.600 --> 3:37:26.480]  it to people so i thank you for understanding i think i think you for understanding the scope
[3:37:26.480 --> 3:37:31.280]  of the challenge that we face and for outlining it in a way that you have because it essentially
[3:37:31.840 --> 3:37:38.480]  uh we uh you know these charges have to be presented to the uh judiciary committee which
[3:37:38.480 --> 3:37:44.720]  then will uh hopefully hold a hearing and send it to the house with a report uh which uh then
[3:37:44.720 --> 3:37:49.200]  will be voted on and if the president is impeached in the house he would go on trial in the senate
[3:37:49.200 --> 3:37:56.560]  uh this whole uh this is a moment where we have the opportunity to reclaim our government and
[3:37:56.560 --> 3:38:01.200]  to reclaim all that's good and right in america and what we stand for not only with respect to
[3:38:01.200 --> 3:38:09.360]  each other but what we stand for in the world i love this country i you know there i get chills
[3:38:09.360 --> 3:38:16.720]  when i watch the flag pass by in a parade i feel uh i i i wear an american flag because and it has
[3:38:16.720 --> 3:38:22.400]  a blind person gave it to me because it has usa and braille on it so then even a blind person
[3:38:22.400 --> 3:38:27.120]  would know i'm wearing this flag because i love this country i love the flag i love what america
[3:38:27.120 --> 3:38:33.120]  has historically stood for but i see our country as is being destroyed by people don't want to obey
[3:38:33.120 --> 3:38:38.400]  the law and just want to be a law to themselves uh that's why uh there's got to be an accounting
[3:38:38.960 --> 3:38:44.880]  for the loss of lives of our soldiers that have been uh were sent there on a mission that was
[3:38:44.880 --> 3:38:49.440]  not based in truth there's got to be an accounting for the injuries to them there's got to be an
[3:38:49.440 --> 3:38:54.720]  accounting for the innocent iraqi's who've died for the for the huge amounts of money that were
[3:38:54.720 --> 3:39:00.000]  borrowing to be able to keep this war going and and every other president who has been held to
[3:39:00.640 --> 3:39:09.520]  uh uh a measure of accounting uh their offenses uh pale in comparison to the offenses of this
[3:39:09.520 --> 3:39:14.880]  president and you've put out 35 let's just cover five or six of what you think are most important
[3:39:14.880 --> 3:39:21.680]  and they're all very important uh of those 35 congressman dineska senich well you know the
[3:39:21.680 --> 3:39:26.480]  the ones that deal with iraq really talk about manufacturing a false case for war and and it's
[3:39:26.480 --> 3:39:32.240]  been just demonstrated over and over that all the representations that were made uh that iraq
[3:39:32.240 --> 3:39:37.280]  supposedly had weapons of mass destruction posed an imminent threat uh that uh it had
[3:39:37.280 --> 3:39:42.560]  something to do with 9 11 or okay to throw 9 11 all of those uh attempts to try to get the
[3:39:42.560 --> 3:39:47.440]  american people to believe that and an organized effort was made in fact were based in falsehood
[3:39:48.080 --> 3:39:54.880]  uh and so a war of aggression was began against a country that did not attack us uh and such a
[3:39:54.880 --> 3:40:02.960]  war is in violation of international law uh the uh which puts george bush with in the reach of an
[3:40:02.960 --> 3:40:09.040]  international tribunal this is why congress needs to become involved we cannot let other governments
[3:40:09.600 --> 3:40:17.440]  or other jurisdictions uh do our work for us we need to uh look at the record and recognize
[3:40:17.440 --> 3:40:22.960]  that law has been violated and it has to be come a matter of a systematic public examination when
[3:40:22.960 --> 3:40:27.600]  that happens uh you know it said that you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free
[3:40:27.600 --> 3:40:34.400]  this this country will begin to be freed from the grip of fear which has uh which has been placed
[3:40:34.400 --> 3:40:42.000]  its clammy hold on us uh since 9 11 and the capitalization on the events of 9 11 for political
[3:40:42.000 --> 3:40:47.280]  purposes will end and and we'll merit we'll get our country back this is about getting our country
[3:40:47.280 --> 3:40:53.040]  back uh reestablishing the rule of law getting back our civil liberties putting aside you know
[3:40:53.040 --> 3:40:58.800]  enforcing posse comitatus uh making sure there's no more torture or wiretabbing or eavesdropping
[3:40:58.800 --> 3:41:04.400]  or you know any of the things that that are unamerican we're going to we're going to reclaim
[3:41:04.400 --> 3:41:11.600]  america and the impeachment resolution and the 35 articles are intent on doing just that
[3:41:13.040 --> 3:41:17.200]  you've got quite a few cosponsors just a few days into this tell us about that process sir
[3:41:17.200 --> 3:41:24.640]  uh in well the bill just went to judiciary yesterday and congress adjourned for the week
[3:41:24.640 --> 3:41:32.080]  early in the day uh we have four uh now three cosponsors congressman wexler congresswomen
[3:41:32.080 --> 3:41:39.280]  lee and wilsey have cosponsored uh next week will be an opportunity for people to uh becomes
[3:41:39.840 --> 3:41:46.080]  cosponsors i would ask your listeners to please call their member of congress and indicate your
[3:41:46.080 --> 3:41:50.960]  support for cosponsorship i would ask everyone who's listening please read the articles of
[3:41:50.960 --> 3:41:56.160]  impeachment because the more conversant you are the more fluent you'll be in talking to congressional
[3:41:56.160 --> 3:42:02.240]  staff about the urgency of members of congress getting on to it um my information is available
[3:42:02.240 --> 3:42:08.640]  on my website at casinich.us and certainly uh you know if you check there there's a hundred
[3:42:08.640 --> 3:42:12.960]  thousand places on the web by now that i have information about the articles of impeachment
[3:42:12.960 --> 3:42:16.560]  uh you know this is a time for us to all to get involved so what you can do is
[3:42:17.120 --> 3:42:21.920]  is learn about it read about it be conversant in it contact a member of congress make sure
[3:42:21.920 --> 3:42:29.040]  that they've read it ask them to support the resolution hr uh 12 58 and then demand hearings
[3:42:29.040 --> 3:42:35.280]  we have to have hearings we cannot avert our eyes so that's the key the the hearings will open up
[3:42:35.280 --> 3:42:40.880]  this evidence it will become a televised spectacle which is what we need so more people learn about
[3:42:40.880 --> 3:42:45.200]  the crimes that have committed and by the way you had to stop at 35 uh there were i mean what about
[3:42:45.200 --> 3:42:49.760]  a million dead iraqis uh what about i mean when you add it all together but frankly i've got to
[3:42:49.760 --> 3:42:55.600]  say that yours is very measured and i would call even conservative as bad as the 35 are now i had
[3:42:55.600 --> 3:43:01.920]  read that 25 congressmen and women had quote signed onto it i'd seen a media blurb is it i
[3:43:01.920 --> 3:43:05.920]  guess that means they have publicly said they're supporting it they just haven't done it they may
[3:43:05.920 --> 3:43:10.720]  be confused about that that may have related to the cheney impeachment i'm not aware that we
[3:43:10.720 --> 3:43:19.520]  have 25 co-sponsors but i will find that out immediately all right um how soon until we'll
[3:43:19.520 --> 3:43:26.400]  find out if we're able to force hearings in the house well here's here's what i've said uh we we
[3:43:26.400 --> 3:43:31.840]  need to start making calls and all next week we need to be calling members of congress and encouraging
[3:43:31.840 --> 3:43:39.840]  them to sign on uh and um and also encouraging them to ask for hearings and judiciary um i'm going
[3:43:39.840 --> 3:43:43.680]  to be meeting with the chairman of judiciary and also with members of the judiciary committee
[3:43:43.680 --> 3:43:49.840]  providing them with backup documentation for the charges that are in the articles uh i'm uh you
[3:43:49.840 --> 3:43:54.400]  know and i feel it's it's important that they have uh some a little bit of time to be able to read
[3:43:54.400 --> 3:43:59.840]  them and digest them and make a decision i've made it clear though that in the face of statements
[3:43:59.840 --> 3:44:06.320]  by the house leadership that this thing is dead on arrival that unlike other resolutions where in
[3:44:06.320 --> 3:44:10.960]  fact if you were to do so bill it goes to committee they don't hold hearings it is dead a privilege
[3:44:10.960 --> 3:44:16.000]  resolution is one that you can bring back again so i've made it very clear if there's no action
[3:44:16.000 --> 3:44:22.960]  within 30 days i will come back with 60 articles of impeachment and uh and and stand on the house floor
[3:44:23.920 --> 3:44:31.440]  for eight hours and read them and so that the nation can once again hear what's going on congressman
[3:44:31.440 --> 3:44:37.920]  i could never imagine reading these 35 articles of impeachment a more provable case i mean in their
[3:44:37.920 --> 3:44:44.720]  own memos their own executive orders their own pentagon battle plans this uh the fake newscast
[3:44:44.720 --> 3:44:50.320]  paying for fake media agents of influence i mean i mean here's an example this morning i ran across
[3:44:50.320 --> 3:44:55.760]  a story i'd forgotten about from a few months ago london guardian associated press where john
[3:44:55.760 --> 3:45:00.240]  mccain went to a fundraiser in london raised hundreds of thousands of dollars admitted it was
[3:45:00.240 --> 3:45:05.760]  illegal there's no debating each count is a felony and then he just said so what i mean
[3:45:05.760 --> 3:45:11.040]  that's just another example of the government on every level is just going completely lawless it
[3:45:11.040 --> 3:45:19.200]  what has happened it's like a well well let me tell you um people who are our usx patriots people
[3:45:19.200 --> 3:45:26.480]  who live in in another country but our citizens of the united states can contribute to to the
[3:45:26.480 --> 3:45:31.360]  campaign of a federal candidate but they admitted these weren't u.s citizens are well that's a
[3:45:31.360 --> 3:45:34.880]  whole different deal i mean i don't know i had this first i've heard of it that was the Rothschild
[3:45:34.880 --> 3:45:43.280]  meeting as wow well but you know my my concern here is that in upholding the rule of law uh we
[3:45:43.280 --> 3:45:49.120]  are basically correcting you know correcting the direction of our ship of state that's it
[3:45:49.120 --> 3:45:54.160]  we're complicit if we don't do what you're doing right now we have a moral obligation to get behind
[3:45:54.160 --> 3:46:00.640]  deniz kasanics yeah alex i appreciate that i also want to say that i've just had my office check
[3:46:01.360 --> 3:46:07.680]  the uh impeachment resolution with respect to uh vice president cheney had 27 co-sponsors
[3:46:08.320 --> 3:46:13.680]  our bill that we've just introduced uh and and people had to put their name in as they
[3:46:13.680 --> 3:46:19.680]  you know we're leaving for the break uh for the weekend we have three so that it'll it'll
[3:46:19.680 --> 3:46:24.560]  by next week i'm confident as people hear from their constituents around the country that they'll
[3:46:24.560 --> 3:46:30.240]  come back and sign on congressman with trillions missing from the pentagon three trillions spent
[3:46:30.240 --> 3:46:35.040]  on the war you haven't heard the clip but we played it earlier of michael reagan saying that
[3:46:35.040 --> 3:46:40.320]  nine eleven truthers should be taken out summarily and killed without trials and he said i will pay
[3:46:40.320 --> 3:46:46.800]  for the bullets and i've seen similar rhetoric from these neocons and talk radio i it seems
[3:46:46.800 --> 3:46:50.800]  like they're cornered now and that they're more dangerous than ever can you speak i mean are you
[3:46:50.800 --> 3:46:55.360]  getting a sense because you're up there in the cat bird seat in congress that that things are coming
[3:46:55.360 --> 3:47:03.600]  to a head right now we you know our country these events over the last seven years have really divided
[3:47:03.600 --> 3:47:11.680]  our country uh and and we need to find a way to unite we can unite in truth um we we need to understand
[3:47:11.680 --> 3:47:18.320]  it that there's just deep concern that people have on all sides that that there's that things are
[3:47:18.320 --> 3:47:23.520]  unfair and that people are being unfairly accused well that's why we need hearings to bring it all
[3:47:23.520 --> 3:47:28.480]  out well you've been championing the the the fact that we have the e-pay report that the dust was
[3:47:28.480 --> 3:47:33.520]  deadly and they covered it up now they've had to basically admit a lot of that in scientific studies
[3:47:33.520 --> 3:47:38.240]  and and we're called traders for even saying we should give health care to the firemen and police
[3:47:38.240 --> 3:47:42.640]  well i i felt very you're correct in what you just said but i will i will say this
[3:47:43.520 --> 3:47:51.040]  that i feel strongly enough about bringing out the truth about 9 11 that i brought forth articles
[3:47:51.760 --> 3:48:02.960]  that uh uh that for the first time uh make uh 9 11 uh truth a uh uh a serious discussion
[3:48:02.960 --> 3:48:11.120]  in uh the articles of impeachment the uh positive the obstruction of of the investigation into the
[3:48:11.120 --> 3:48:19.280]  attacks of 9 11 the um the fact that the there were the the administration repeatedly ignored
[3:48:19.280 --> 3:48:23.200]  and failed to respond to highly high level intelligence warnings of a planned attack
[3:48:23.200 --> 3:48:29.120]  you've got them there and they were caught lying to congress on that uh and yeah and and the fact
[3:48:29.120 --> 3:48:37.440]  that uh the 9 11 uh those who responded to 9 11 uh were not told of the of the dangers to their health

[3:54:50.320 --> 3:54:54.640]  shift that aligns us again with our basic principles about which this country was founded
[3:54:54.640 --> 3:55:00.000]  we got to break this washington mindset that of of insularity and unaccountability
[3:55:00.000 --> 3:55:04.000]  and reach out and reconnect with each other and and with people all over the globe
[3:55:04.000 --> 3:55:08.480]  and this isn't about democrat or republican it's not about right or left it's about the
[3:55:08.480 --> 3:55:13.760]  truth and the truth doesn't have a political party well congressman i totally agree with you
[3:55:14.480 --> 3:55:18.400]  on that we were talking in the break about how they're acting like cornered rats
[3:55:18.400 --> 3:55:22.880]  but that shows that we're really having success here and you know when you talk about how
[3:55:22.880 --> 3:55:27.920]  you know this is the right thing to do it it is a fight between good and evil there's no doubt
[3:55:27.920 --> 3:55:33.440]  true evil has reared its head in our time in our country and i don't see how anybody out there
[3:55:33.440 --> 3:55:38.960]  would not get off the fence what are some of the basic things that average joes can do i mean
[3:55:38.960 --> 3:55:43.840]  go when their congressman or woman is in the local district first it first it is important
[3:55:43.840 --> 3:55:49.440]  that everyone reads these articles because we need to be conversant in what you know what the
[3:55:49.440 --> 3:55:56.320]  issues are the next thing is call your member of congress and ask that member to read the articles
[3:55:56.320 --> 3:56:04.720]  and after doing so to sign on to house resolution 12 58 and then encourage us also the hearings
[3:56:04.720 --> 3:56:08.640]  and judiciary now i have said you know people said well this thing they're not going to hold
[3:56:08.640 --> 3:56:13.600]  any hearings this thing is a dead deal i have said that i'll be back with with 60 articles in a
[3:56:13.600 --> 3:56:18.000]  month if they don't hold any hearings we're not going to let this go this is not going to go away
[3:56:18.000 --> 3:56:25.440]  we're going to continue to in our efforts to save this country from this calamity of of deception
[3:56:25.440 --> 3:56:33.520]  and of anti-democratic behavior and destruction of the law international law as well as domestic
[3:56:33.520 --> 3:56:38.400]  and the destruction of our constitution i believe in america i love this country i do too congressman
[3:56:39.120 --> 3:56:43.920]  in closing i would liken this to a new declaration of independence and people will rally to it and
[3:56:43.920 --> 3:56:49.280]  push it and expose it and if we can get hearings uh they will be brought down and we can get our
