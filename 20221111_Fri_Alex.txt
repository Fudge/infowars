[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  The Republicans are winning the races in Arizona, and divided despite each state of
[00:09.000 --> 00:10.000]  tension still.
[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  We're not on the woods yet.
[00:12.000 --> 00:14.000]  Stay with us for this live emergency broadcast.
[00:14.000 --> 00:16.000]  It's Friday.
[00:16.000 --> 00:39.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:39.000 --> 00:55.000]  The phone is in New York City, but just a boy right through the park.
[00:55.000 --> 01:15.000]  It's Friday, November 11th, 2022.
[01:15.000 --> 01:24.000]  And the tectonic forces of liberty are now like volcanoes beginning to explode above the surface.
[01:24.000 --> 01:27.000]  And the enemies of freedom are in a full panic and a frown.
[01:27.000 --> 01:34.000]  Everything they've got at us, but they still weren't able to suppress the takeover of the house.
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.000]  And it looks like the Senate.
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.000]  Owen Schroyer has been doing excellent analysis of all this.
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.000]  He joins us from the War Room studios in the next segment.
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  And then we have a raft of other special guests today.
[01:49.000 --> 01:55.000]  You have McGinnis, Kent Henshin-Lively, Jay Dyer, and others.
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.000]  And I intend to also jam some of your phone calls in.
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.000]  That said, there's a lot of other big news we're going to be hitting.
[02:04.000 --> 02:12.000]  You know, in the last 20 years, they've used mRNA technology in hundreds of studies with volunteers.
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  Not just here, but around the world that we know of.
[02:16.000 --> 02:27.000]  And in every case, a large portion of the individuals that have attested on them die horribly painful deaths.
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.000]  Their brains rot.
[02:29.000 --> 02:31.000]  Their livers liquefy.
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.000]  Their blood coagulates.
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  And it's happened again.
[02:37.000 --> 02:43.000]  New York man dies while being treated with experimental gene editing technology crisper.
[02:43.000 --> 02:53.000]  What do you think they just did with the mRNA shots to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds if not above a billion people that took it?
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.000]  And I've got a bunch more news on that.
[02:55.000 --> 03:02.000]  So they had one person sign on and got FDA approval for this experimental test.
[03:02.000 --> 03:03.000]  Killed them.
[03:03.000 --> 03:06.000]  Just like that.
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000]  One person.
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.000]  Don't look at the other cases of the last 20 years.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  We've covered them.
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.000]  The most common thing is organ failure.
[03:15.000 --> 03:17.000]  Starting with your liver.
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  You're not supposed to edit genes.
[03:22.000 --> 03:25.000]  I mean, hell, they even know that in movies like Blade Runner back in the 80s.
[03:25.000 --> 03:27.000]  Because they based that on real scientific studies.
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.000]  The movie was an update on new Android's dream of electric sheep written by Phil K. Dick in the 70s.
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  But they updated it and talked to genetic engineers in the 80s for the movie.
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  And they said, you can't change the genes of somebody once the egg and the sperm have come together.
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  You can't go in and edit them.
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  It will, they'd go through and explain what they'd already done back then.
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  Primitive like genes.
[03:48.000 --> 03:54.000]  And they think, I guess if they give enough people, a billion people, they'll find some that survive and find the secret there.
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  This is all mass experimentation.
[03:56.000 --> 04:02.000]  This is insanity.
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  So that's coming up as well.
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  And boy, a bunch of globalists have come out and announced world government.
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  We've got that for you.
[04:09.000 --> 04:10.000]  So much more.
[04:10.000 --> 04:16.000]  But when we return, we are going to get right into all of the election news.
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  And boy, we suspected fraud Tuesday night.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  But now the evidence is overwhelming.
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  We've got the Trump to Santa Civil War kicked off by Trump.
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  Got mixed feelings about that.
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.000]  Maricopa County in Arizona to take up until next week to process $400,000 ballots.
[04:34.000 --> 04:41.000]  It worked once, why not twice here are the five ways Democrats are cheating and stealing 22 election like they did in 2020.
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.000]  Lauren, Lauren, Bobert wins Colorado.
[04:45.000 --> 04:52.000]  Also Arizona and Nevada solid GOP wins the laser media anti-Trump narrative engineering efforts.
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  I agree with conservatory houses analysis.
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  That's Steve Bannas as well.
[04:57.000 --> 05:04.000]  Steve Bannas.
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.000]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[05:08.000 --> 05:18.000]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians.
[05:18.000 --> 05:20.000]  Not just in America, but worldwide.
[05:20.000 --> 05:27.000]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is info wars because we know the globalist number.
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.000]  We know their operation.
[05:29.000 --> 05:30.000]  We know their modus operandi.
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.000]  And we know how to take them down peacefully.
[05:32.000 --> 05:40.000]  We've got great products that fund the operation that also are incredibly powerful and the highest quality for your immune system and more.
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  We have the biggest cell the year going right now.
[05:42.000 --> 05:43.000]  Black Friday comes early.
[05:43.000 --> 05:51.000]  Use promo code 1776 and get up to 60% off on these best selling products at infowarstore.com.
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.000]  Biggest cell of the year, promo code 1776 up to 60% off.
[05:55.000 --> 06:24.000]  Take action now and empower your body.
[06:26.000 --> 06:30.000]  It's Friday, November 11th, 2022.
[06:30.000 --> 06:31.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[06:31.000 --> 06:46.000]  We're about to dive into the ongoing battleground developments in Arizona and Nevada as well as some of the other key races in Colorado and obviously the runoff coming up in Georgia.
[06:46.000 --> 06:48.000]  But we now know what's going on.
[06:48.000 --> 06:57.000]  The deep state is trying to extend this out as long as they can to try to produce and stuff ballots so that they can steal Nevada and Arizona.
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  And they also don't want Republicans to have a victory.
[06:59.000 --> 07:00.000]  They want to depress us.
[07:00.000 --> 07:02.000]  They want to demoralize us.
[07:02.000 --> 07:07.000]  We're going to be laying all of that out here today in great detail.
[07:07.000 --> 07:15.000]  Also, we're going to be looking at what Trump said last night on his true social coming out and attacking Governor DeSantis.
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.000]  Not a good idea.
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  It's exactly what the corporate media wants.
[07:20.000 --> 07:39.000]  They had CNNs, New York Times, Fox News, all of the establishment media other than a few exceptions like Eric Carlson have come out and have praised DeSantis and attacked Trump and said that Trump's the reason we didn't win bigger in the midterms and all this made up garbage to get us fighting with each other.
[07:39.000 --> 07:46.000]  And Trump with his ego as big as the moon has taken the bait.
[07:46.000 --> 07:50.000]  No, I love Trump and come out and attack DeSantis when DeSantis has never attacked Trump.
[07:50.000 --> 07:54.000]  And so now it's not about a stolen election or an attempted steal.
[07:54.000 --> 07:57.000]  Now it's not about Biden being 80 and a geriatric patient.
[07:57.000 --> 08:05.000]  It's not about Federman being a mentally, you know, destroyed giant zombie goblin leader.
[08:05.000 --> 08:11.000]  It's all about Trump, DeSantis, and Trump is the reason Republicans didn't win bigger.
[08:11.000 --> 08:18.000]  Total distraction from reality and Trump has waited straight into it and is attacking DeSantis.
[08:18.000 --> 08:20.000]  I wish he would just stop.
[08:20.000 --> 08:22.000]  He's also set to announce he's running for president.
[08:22.000 --> 08:23.000]  Great.
[08:23.000 --> 08:24.000]  I'm mad at Trump over the shots.
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.000]  Wish he would have come out against him like DeSantis did.
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.000]  But overall, the globalists hate Trump more than anybody.
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.000]  He's anti-New World Order.
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  He's obviously better than the Democrats.
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.000]  But it's just we need to not be fighting with each other, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.000]  We need to not be battling with each other.
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.000]  It really is that simple.
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  Statement by President Donald J. Trump for the President of the United States of America.
[08:51.000 --> 08:56.000]  He goes into how about Fox News is basically boosting DeSantis and not him for president.
[08:56.000 --> 09:03.000]  And he made DeSantis and DeSantis has all these neocons fluttering around him that he's meeting with.
[09:03.000 --> 09:04.000]  This is true.
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  I don't like Jeb Bush hanging around.
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  I don't like Mitt Romney hanging around.
[09:08.000 --> 09:09.000]  But you know what?
[09:09.000 --> 09:12.000]  Trump's hung out with all those guys, too, till they triple-stab him in the back.
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  So the jury's out on that with DeSantis.
[09:15.000 --> 09:22.000]  And I'm not going to get in this beauty pageant of Trump's better or DeSantis is better or Trump's worse or DeSantis is worse.
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.000]  I'm just not going to do it.
[09:24.000 --> 09:30.000]  And people need to stay focused on inflation, the open borders, the exploding crime, the war in Ukraine,
[09:30.000 --> 09:36.000]  the poison shots, how they're trying to come back out with more forced injections and lockdowns in the future,
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.000]  all the pedophile drag queen storytime garbage going on.
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  We need to be issue-oriented.
[09:42.000 --> 09:49.000]  And instead of making it about the Democrats trying to steal the election and blunting the victory,
[09:49.000 --> 09:55.000]  instead of making it about how we need to get rid of the Republican, neocon, rhino,
[09:55.000 --> 10:04.000]  corporatist leadership like Mitch McConnell and others, instead of that, it's all about Trump and DeSantis.
[10:04.000 --> 10:10.000]  And that's why the Republican establishment has weighed in with the liberal media to try to create a Trump-DeSantis rift.
[10:10.000 --> 10:16.000]  And old 45 has taken the bait, like a big old bass, you put a purple worm in front of.
[10:16.000 --> 10:21.000]  Sean Troyer's riding shotgun with us from the war room here in the M4 Studios in Austin, Texas.
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.000]  I think it was his take on this and then some of these battleground races.
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.000]  Some are already calling it for Lauren Boebert in Colorado.
[10:29.000 --> 10:34.000]  But the mainstream media is saying that that's not a fact yet.
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.000]  There's so many different angles to hit here.
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  Also, Gateway Punn has been doing a great job laying out all the evidence of fraud that's there.
[10:41.000 --> 10:45.000]  And we have a lot of Republican officials at the state level, like in Houston, Texas,
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.000]  giving press conferences, going over those incredible anomalies.
[10:49.000 --> 10:51.000]  That's coming up as well at the bottom of the hour.
[10:51.000 --> 10:54.000]  Owen Troyer, what are you going to hit first?
[10:54.000 --> 10:58.000]  Well, just quickly, let me respond to what you opened the show with today.
[10:58.000 --> 11:05.000]  There's no doubt that the Democrats and perhaps even the Republican establishment in their own blindness
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.000]  want to make the 2024 presidential election all about Trump
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.000]  instead of the failed policies of Biden, like you're mentioning with inflation, the open border.
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  But that debate will obviously come.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  Let's talk about where we stand right now.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  I don't like what I'm seeing in Arizona.
[11:21.000 --> 11:26.000]  And despite the confidence that Lake and Masters still have
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.000]  that these late night, last minute ballot dumps are going to favor them,
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  I'm just not seeing it, Alex. They're not getting the returns they thought.
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.000]  They thought they were going to be getting about 60, even even 70%
[11:37.000 --> 11:41.000]  of some of these last minute returns coming from more conservative areas.
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  They're just not getting it. They're just not getting it.
[11:43.000 --> 11:47.000]  In fact, Katie Hobbs lead was actually extended last night
[11:47.000 --> 11:51.000]  with the late night, last minute ballot drop still coming in.
[11:51.000 --> 11:53.000]  They say 82% are in.
[11:53.000 --> 11:58.000]  So this is going to be a miracle comeback at this point, I think, for Kerry Lake.
[11:58.000 --> 12:04.000]  And then even farther behind now is Blake Masters to the incumbent Mark Kelly.
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.000]  That will take a miracle at this point for Masters to pull this one off.
[12:09.000 --> 12:13.000]  I don't know how he does. The returns are not coming in favorable right now
[12:13.000 --> 12:18.000]  for Republicans, and it's been shown that the incumbents did really well
[12:18.000 --> 12:19.000]  in this go around.
[12:19.000 --> 12:23.000]  So I don't see the Republicans getting the Arizona Senate seat
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  that they so desired with Blake Masters.
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  But really the issue is going to become this,
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.000]  because I would guess that Hobbs is going to win.
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  I would guess that Kelly is going to win.
[12:34.000 --> 12:39.000]  And I forget the name of the attorney general there that's beating Abe Hamaday,
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.000]  but it looks like he's going to win as well,
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  even though that is the tightest of the races.
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  And so this was a three-headed monster, if you will,
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  or a trifecta of the new brand of conservative, the fighter,
[12:52.000 --> 12:55.000]  the one that takes on the media, the one that takes on the establishment,
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.000]  the one that's not afraid to back Trump or give him trouble if they have to.
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.000]  And so we were kind of looking at this race in Arizona saying,
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.000]  this could be a determining factor of what the future of the Republican Party looks like
[13:09.000 --> 13:13.000]  if we have big wins in Arizona, this new breed of Republican
[13:13.000 --> 13:16.000]  that Blake and Masters and Hamaday represent
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  is going to be the type of person the Republicans may want to put forward.
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  Well, they're not winning.
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.000]  You're not hearing much from the GOP establishment as far as what's going on over there
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  with the voting machine shutting down right out of the gates
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.000]  with the election tabulation taking days, maybe weeks, maybe months.
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  Who knows how long.
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.000]  And so that to me says that this, what the Republican leadership,
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  what the Republican establishment is doing right now is setting it up.
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  Trump is their number one enemy.
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  Trump is their number one priority, not even to win at this point.
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  They don't even care if they lose the Senate at this point,
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  which I think they actually are going to,
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  because when you look at what's going to happen in Georgia on,
[13:57.000 --> 14:01.000]  I think December 4th or December 7th, they have early voting there too.
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.000]  So you're going to have two or three or four days of early voting,
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  then the election day in Georgia.
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  You think Democrats are going to let that seat go?
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  You really think Democrats are going to let that seat go?
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.000]  You really think Republicans are going to try to push Herschel Walker over the edge?
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  Let me ask you, what are they doing right now?
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  Oh, you don't have an answer because they're doing nothing.
[14:17.000 --> 14:21.000]  Meanwhile, if you are in Georgia, you're getting blown up from Warnock's people.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  You're getting mass text messages.
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  They're already doing mass fundraising.
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  They already have boots on the ground.
[14:27.000 --> 14:28.000]  And what do we have?
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  We have Ted Cruz and Herschel Walker going on Fox News.
[14:30.000 --> 14:31.000]  That's it.
[14:31.000 --> 14:36.000]  So I don't like what I'm seeing right now as far as the Senate seats are concerned.
[14:36.000 --> 14:42.000]  Now, the one hope is Laxalt in Nevada who continues to lead,
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.000]  even though the margin is small, he does continue to lead.
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  But here's the problem, Alex.
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  It looks like we may have a similar story.
[14:51.000 --> 14:56.000]  If we go down to the map here, the returns coming in from Clark County,
[14:56.000 --> 14:59.000]  which is mostly just Las Vegas, have remained consistent.
[14:59.000 --> 15:02.000]  Mastow has expanded his lead a little bit.
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  He's got about a 40,000-vote lead.
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.000]  93% of the vote in the returns have favored Mastow the hallway.
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  So I don't expect that to change.
[15:11.000 --> 15:18.000]  But when we go up to Washaw County and the Reno area, this is where the Shenanigans went down.
[15:18.000 --> 15:24.000]  Laxalt was winning the entire race up until maybe 24 or 48 hours ago.
[15:24.000 --> 15:27.000]  All of a sudden, Mastow started taking over.
[15:27.000 --> 15:32.000]  And ever since then, most of the incoming ballots have been Democrat.
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  They say 86% of the vote is in there.
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.000]  That's all they need is a few jurisdictions that have big populations to steal any elections.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  So we're going to take every city back.
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  It's a tall order, but it's better than being slaves to these people.
[15:43.000 --> 15:44.000]  We don't have a choice.
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.000]  Stay there. I want you to finish up with Nevada, look at some of the other key races, and then get a big picture
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  of how they're successfully starting this Trump versus the Santa Civil War,
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.000]  instead of us targeting the Republican leadership to be removed and get patriots in.
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  Owen Schroyer, stay there.
[15:59.000 --> 16:06.000]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness Company,
[16:06.000 --> 16:17.000]  an alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[16:17.000 --> 16:24.000]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide, providing uncensored content,
[16:24.000 --> 16:30.000]  virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[16:30.000 --> 16:37.000]  treatment packages specifically for COVID, post COVID, vaccine injury syndromes,
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  and all the usual things that are seen in primary care.
[16:41.000 --> 16:50.000]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media and health advice.
[16:50.000 --> 16:59.000]  Come see the Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to the Wellness Company.
[16:59.000 --> 17:06.000]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you.
[17:06.000 --> 17:09.000]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence info wars,
[17:09.000 --> 17:14.000]  because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people,
[17:14.000 --> 17:20.000]  not as of America, but the world, to the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[17:20.000 --> 17:25.000]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links from infowars.com

[17:45.000 --> 17:49.000]  who have my commitment to never give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.

[19:33.000 --> 19:39.000]  but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[19:39.000 --> 19:48.000]  It's unsustainable. So please visit saveinfowars.com, saveinfowars.com where you can make straight donations,
[19:48.000 --> 19:53.000]  five, ten, fifty hundred dollars, whatever you can so that I can continue to persevere.
[19:53.000 --> 19:56.000]  I'll never give up. I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[19:56.000 --> 20:00.000]  Thank you for your support. Wouldn't be without you, saveinfowars.com.
[20:27.000 --> 20:33.000]  We're going into total world government and their operations to depopulate us forcibly.
[20:33.000 --> 20:36.000]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host, Owen Schroeder's in the war room.
[20:36.000 --> 20:40.000]  Giving us the latest analysis, you were right in the middle of breaking down the U.S. Senate race
[20:40.000 --> 20:45.000]  between Adam Laxalt and the Deep Stater. Please continue.
[20:45.000 --> 20:51.000]  Well, this is really the only hope I see that Republicans have of having a chance at the Senate
[20:51.000 --> 20:56.000]  or having a shot that the Democrats are not going to completely control the Senate
[20:56.000 --> 21:01.000]  with that rat Chuck Schumer as the majority leader and that is the race in Nevada
[21:01.000 --> 21:10.000]  where Adam Laxalt has been leading the entire way, but his lead continues to shrink now just 9,000 votes
[21:10.000 --> 21:18.000]  and with the trends coming in and Washaw County, there is a shot that he could be overcome
[21:18.000 --> 21:24.000]  and so with 86% of the vote in, it's going to be, I mean, it's going to be razor thin,
[21:24.000 --> 21:29.000]  but as they continue to count votes in Clark County, Las Vegas as well,
[21:29.000 --> 21:36.000]  the addition that the Democrat advantage has there might be enough to put Masto over the top
[21:36.000 --> 21:43.000]  and so the question then becomes, what are the Republicans going to do if that happens?
[21:43.000 --> 21:46.000]  Are they just going to take it lying down? Are they going to trust the result and say,
[21:46.000 --> 21:50.000]  oh, of course, of course, Laxalt was winning the entire time,
[21:50.000 --> 21:55.000]  but then the votes that were counted four days after the election put the Democrat over the top to win.
[21:55.000 --> 22:01.000]  Okay, yeah, we trust that. That's what's really going on, but that's where we're at right now.
[22:01.000 --> 22:05.000]  So Laxalt is the best hope Republicans have to maintain the Senate.
[22:05.000 --> 22:10.000]  If he loses, I don't think Masters is going to overcome the lead that Kelly has
[22:10.000 --> 22:18.000]  but boom, the Democrats now have 51 seats in the Senate and then the runoff would just be like gravy for them
[22:18.000 --> 22:23.000]  if they can get that in Georgia, which sadly I kind of expect them to win at this point.
[22:23.000 --> 22:26.000]  I'm not sure what the Republican plan is for Georgia.
[22:26.000 --> 22:32.000]  If they think going on Fox News is the key, if they think going on Sean Hannity is the key,
[22:32.000 --> 22:38.000]  then they're going to lose, period. That's it, end of sentence.
[22:38.000 --> 22:43.000]  They have no boots on the ground. They have no plan. Nothing from McConnell.
[22:43.000 --> 22:46.000]  Where is McConnell, by the way? Anybody heard from McConnell?
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.000]  He's last couple days. No, he's hiding in a hole. He's loving what he's seeing.
[22:50.000 --> 22:56.000]  He wants to lose the Senate. He wants to lose the Senate so he can blame it on Donald Trump
[22:56.000 --> 23:06.000]  and then make his number one initiative from now till 2024 is to get Trump out of the party
[23:06.000 --> 23:09.000]  no matter what you the voter think. This is what it's all about.
[23:09.000 --> 23:12.000]  This is the new battle for the GOP.
[23:12.000 --> 23:20.000]  Are Republican politics and policy going to come from the voter up to the leadership?
[23:20.000 --> 23:27.000]  Or are Republican politics and policy going to come from the leadership dictating what's going to be done to the voter?
[23:27.000 --> 23:32.000]  That's what is at stake here. Mitch McConnell wants to be in charge.
[23:32.000 --> 23:39.000]  The Republican establishment, the GOP, want to dictate policy from their thrones as they see it
[23:39.000 --> 23:42.000]  instead of listening to the American voter.
[23:42.000 --> 23:47.000]  And it's hurt them so far in this midterm, but they don't care
[23:47.000 --> 23:52.000]  because their number one priority is clearly to get rid of Donald Trump.
[23:52.000 --> 23:58.000]  So when you have, it's three or four days of early voting for the runoff in Georgia
[23:58.000 --> 24:02.000]  and then I think it's December 7th is the actual day.
[24:02.000 --> 24:07.000]  You know the Democrats are going to stuff those ballots.
[24:07.000 --> 24:10.000]  The Democrats have already launched their ground game.
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.000]  The Democrats have already launched their digital game.
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  They're already fundraising millions of dollars.
[24:15.000 --> 24:22.000]  They were way ahead of this deal where all I've seen from the Republicans is let's get on Fox News.
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.000]  Let's get up on television. That'll do it.
[24:25.000 --> 24:30.000]  Well, I got news for you. Most people in Georgia that you need to vote for Herschel Walker
[24:30.000 --> 24:35.000]  are not watching Fox News. They're just not.
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.000]  So that's not going to help you in Georgia.
[24:37.000 --> 24:42.000]  You need boots on the ground. You need Walker going to Athens.
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  You need him going to Atlanta.
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.000]  I mean, you can hope that enough Republicans show up in these other areas.
[24:49.000 --> 24:53.000]  But if you don't do something about Democrats in the Tri-County area in Atlanta
[24:53.000 --> 24:56.000]  getting over 70% of the vote,
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.000]  if you can't even take Herschel Walker to Athens, Georgia
[25:00.000 --> 25:05.000]  where he was a Heisman Trophy winning athlete in college
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  to do something about 71% for Warnock,
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.000]  you are not going to win Georgia.
[25:12.000 --> 25:15.000]  But we'll cover that when the time comes.
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  Getting back to Arizona, just to look at these splits again, folks.
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  I'm not liking what I'm seeing.
[25:22.000 --> 25:27.000]  And I think this is going to become a major story in the coming weeks and months
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.000]  because I don't think that Cary Lake and Blake Masters are going to go quietly here.
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.000]  Probably not Abe Hamaday either.
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.000]  Because they were expecting here in Maricopa County that this gap was going to close.
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  They were expecting with the new ballots and votes coming in
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.000]  that they would be favoring the Republicans. They haven't.
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.000]  In fact, Hobbs has extended her lead now with 86% of the vote in.
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.000]  So you're talking about in order for Lake to recover any ground here
[25:59.000 --> 26:05.000]  there's going to have to be a complete switch of the trend we've seen in the last 24 hours.
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.000]  And Lake is probably going to have to get 70% if not more,
[26:10.000 --> 26:15.000]  70% of these votes coming in at Maricopa County.
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  I just don't see that happening.
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  I don't think that that number is possible.
[26:19.000 --> 26:23.000]  And so therefore I think that Hobbs is going to end up being the governor.
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.000]  But that's really just where the fight should begin.
[26:26.000 --> 26:32.000]  How do you have all of these disastrous anomalies and machine shutdowns
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  and everything else going on in Arizona when the Secretary of State
[26:36.000 --> 26:41.000]  who's in charge of overseeing the election is on the ballot for governor?
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.000]  Really? You thought that would go fair and square?
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000]  Really? You trusted the Democrat to run the election that she's in fairly?
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  Are you serious?
[26:51.000 --> 26:54.000]  And again, where is the Republican leadership?
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.000]  Where is Rana McDaniel?
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  Where is Kevin McCarthy?
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  Where is Mitch McConnell?
[27:01.000 --> 27:02.000]  Nowhere.
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  They love watching this.
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  They don't want Kerry Lake to win.
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  They don't want Blake Masters to win.
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  They don't want Homiday to win because they listen to the voters
[27:12.000 --> 27:16.000]  and represent the brand of the Republican Party that's going to send Mitch McConnell
[27:16.000 --> 27:21.000]  and Kevin McCarthy and Rana McDaniel to the curb or the trash bin where they belong.
[27:21.000 --> 27:26.000]  This is where they belong right here in this trash bin.
[27:26.000 --> 27:31.000]  But see, you're already seeing it playing out.
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  You're already seeing it playing out.
[27:33.000 --> 27:34.000]  Get Trump.
[27:34.000 --> 27:35.000]  That's the story.
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  Trump's the reason why we lost.
[27:37.000 --> 27:41.000]  Really? Because Trump's been playing golf for the last two years.
[27:41.000 --> 27:47.000]  Trump got, you begged Trump to do rallies for Republicans ahead of the midterms.
[27:47.000 --> 27:48.000]  And guess what?
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.000]  Trump did more for the Republican Party ahead of the midterms than Mitch McConnell,
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.000]  Kevin McCarthy, and Rana McDaniel combined.
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  Owen, you are absolutely right.
[27:58.000 --> 28:04.000]  And that's why we cannot take the bait and get into this DeSantis versus Trump versus DeSantis garbage.
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  And Trump is really taking the bait.
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  And we care about Trump, but you're absolutely right.
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.000]  We need to focus on the Republican leadership and on this election fraud and on issues.
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  We've got to get that talking point out.
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.000]  And our millions of listeners right now and viewers can do that, folks.
[28:17.000 --> 28:20.000]  Don't take the bait of this Trump DeSantis garbage.
[28:20.000 --> 28:23.000]  We've got to stay on McConnell, Kevin McCarthy.
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  We've got to stay on these elections.
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  We've got to stay on the issues.
[28:27.000 --> 28:35.000]  So I don't think Arizona is going to go away, even when they declare Hobbes and when they declare Kelly the winners.
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  I don't think this is going to go away, Alex.
[28:37.000 --> 28:46.000]  And now you're going to see the new phenomenon of what can Lake, what can Masters, what can Hamaday do without any support from the Republican Party.
[28:46.000 --> 28:51.000]  Trump has already kind of tested those waters and been successful, but can they do it in Arizona?
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  That's going to be the question.
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  Hold on. Stay there.
[28:53.000 --> 28:57.000]  I want to come back with some of the big election fraud evidence with Owen Schroder and Alex Jones.

[31:59.000 --> 32:11.000]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[32:11.000 --> 32:16.000]  The First Amendment is unique in the world. That's what they want to take away. Your ability to speak freely.
[32:16.000 --> 32:20.000]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next. Or they're going to go for Steve Bannon. Or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[32:20.000 --> 32:25.000]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago but only 28 years. And I knew they were planning all of this.
[32:25.000 --> 32:29.000]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere. But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[32:29.000 --> 32:37.000]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[32:37.000 --> 32:42.000]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been because of your past support.
[32:42.000 --> 32:52.000]  So I salute you and I thank you. And I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle, free double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[32:52.000 --> 33:13.000]  1776 is the promo code. The destination is infowarstore.com. And I thank you all for your support.
[33:23.000 --> 33:31.000]  A lot of things happened. Republicans are going to win no matter what. You don't have to vote.
[33:31.000 --> 33:37.000]  But we know there was the same playbook of fraud in the key battleground states we saw before.
[33:37.000 --> 33:47.000]  The unexplained ballot drops in Georgia and Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Colorado.
[33:47.000 --> 33:59.000]  And we've got a really powerful video that's up on infowarstore.com. Harris County GOP leader list all of the anomalies and election day that specifically occurred in Republican stronghold polling locations like the machines going out.
[33:59.000 --> 34:09.000]  Same story all over the country that's coming up after our guest. Leave us. We have several other big guests today. We have Roger Stone, former host of the war room, cohost of the destroyer.
[34:09.000 --> 34:17.000]  We have the current host of the war room, destroyer in the original war room studio, writing shotgun with us to add commentary during these segments.
[34:17.000 --> 34:29.000]  Obviously, Roger's here also about the attempt to cause this GOP civil war between Trump and DeSantis, instead of it being about getting rid of Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell.
[34:29.000 --> 34:35.000]  Absolutely disgusting that so many people are taking this bait. And quite frankly, you know, I really like Trump.
[34:35.000 --> 34:42.000]  And I'd love to support for president and I do. But he's really taken the bait coming out against DeSantis here, making this the issue.
[34:42.000 --> 34:48.000]  I wish he would have attacked the Republican leadership themselves. Roger Stone, what do you make of this?
[34:48.000 --> 34:56.000]  Well, Alex, first of all, I have to say that everything President Trump said in his posts last night is true.
[34:56.000 --> 35:06.000]  However, we didn't know that with the party and the country was going to be in this place today. Actually, if you go back and watch our broadcast here on Info Wars,
[35:06.000 --> 35:15.000]  prior to election, virtually everything I told you was going to happen has happened. We didn't have a red wave. We had a red drizzle.
[35:15.000 --> 35:26.000]  And you're absolutely right. The same manipulators of the elections in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Arizona are up to the same exact tricks.
[35:26.000 --> 35:42.000]  I saw a terrific segment you did with Mike Lindell. Mike Lindell spent a lot of his own money to be able to show in real time these illicit ballot drops in which the votes in those states were manipulated.
[35:42.000 --> 35:50.000]  So at this moment, we don't know that there even is Republican control of the House, although it looks likely.
[35:50.000 --> 36:04.000]  And even if that is true, it'll be by a very slim majority. That gives rise to a strategy that I laid out on this show in which a small subset of America first patriots,
[36:04.000 --> 36:16.000]  men and women who put country ahead of party, men and women who are not going to give in to the inducements by would be Speaker McCarthy for
[36:16.000 --> 36:36.000]  committee chairmanship or better office space or larger staff budgets to stand up for America. I think that there may be a coup attempt against the House leadership to replace it with leadership that would be more aggressive.
[36:36.000 --> 36:48.000]  I get more specific about this and I want to. Scott Perry from Pennsylvania, head of the Freedom Caucus, sent a list of demands to Kevin McCarthy prior to the election.
[36:48.000 --> 37:05.000]  In that list of demands were articles of impeachment against Joe Biden for various issues, including corruption, articles of impeachment against Kamala Harris for her failure to fulfill her responsibilities regarding sealing our southern border,
[37:05.000 --> 37:21.000]  investigations into Hunter Biden's laptop and all the data there, which is a window into massive corruption, including payoffs to the sitting vice president of the United States, Joe Biden, a real investigation into what happened on January 6,
[37:21.000 --> 37:44.000]  not this fraudulent Kabuki theater that the House Democrats put on. Perhaps even an investigation into the actual origins of the Russian collusion hoax, which if John Durham did nothing else, he exposed that this was a corrupt cabal between
[37:44.000 --> 37:57.000]  the federal government under Barack Obama and the Clinton campaign. So McCarthy, expecting the luxury of a huge supermajority, ignored that letter, hasn't responded to it.
[37:57.000 --> 38:09.000]  Now McCarthy's speakership is actually in peril, Alex, exactly as we predicted on your show. A small handful of patriots here could change the course of history.
[38:09.000 --> 38:25.000]  That's right. You said that a few days ago. Now the New York Times, the Washington Post, today are all panicking, saying exactly what you said first, that because it's so close, it's going to give incredible power to the MTGs, to the Matt Gaetzes out there.
[38:25.000 --> 38:41.000]  And that is, look, that is what we have to be praying for at this moment. In the meantime, it's clear to me that the corporate wing of the Republican Party, Rupert Murdoch, of course, with the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post,
[38:41.000 --> 38:59.000]  Fox News, in concert with billionaires like Ken Griffin, who recently said that the Republican Party needs to get back in alignment with the multinational corporate world, and admits to wanting to stop the populist movement.
[38:59.000 --> 39:11.000]  That's you and I, they're talking about there, Alex, in conjunction with Paul Singer, another globalist billionaire. These are the people propping my governor Ron DeSantis up for a presidential bid.
[39:11.000 --> 39:14.000]  And I think Donald Trump has had enough of it.
[39:14.000 --> 39:29.000]  No, you're right, because they're not just meeting with him, they're all getting behind DeSantis, which even if they're able to cut Trump out, they're going to turn on DeSantis later. These neocons don't support Republicans, they only fund them early to control them.
[39:29.000 --> 39:33.000]  Oh, and amazing points Roger Stone's making. You got any questions or comments for Roger?
[39:33.000 --> 39:51.000]  Well, yeah, I mean, I would just say, I think Roger is spot on, you're seeing kind of the corporate media conservative establishment, you know, tee the ball up or lob the ball up, for eventually, I think they're hoping Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy, Ron McDaniel will come out against Trump, or even the voters.
[39:51.000 --> 40:06.000]  I don't see that necessarily happening. The only person that can separate Trump from his supporters is Trump himself. And with some of these, what people view as ego maniacal diatribes aimed at other Republicans on his true social account, that might be what's doing it.
[40:06.000 --> 40:13.000]  So he is taking the bait, but right now it's the corporate press that are trying to push this message of let's get Trump out.
[40:13.000 --> 40:30.000]  And why haven't we heard from Kevin McCarthy or Mitch McConnell or Ron McDaniel this week? Because they're hiding, and they're hoping that Trump takes the bait or that the voters take the bait that the corporate press is putting out there to start this feud between
[40:30.000 --> 40:37.000]  Trump and DeSantis as we're now going to be quickly entering the presidential race period. It feels like we're already in it just days after the election.
[40:37.000 --> 40:49.000]  But let's be clear about something here. Let's be clear about something. The Republicans used Donald Trump for the last two years. Every email they sent out for fundraising mentioned Donald Trump.
[40:49.000 --> 40:58.000]  They begged Donald Trump to do rallies for Republicans, which he did and got massive turnout. That would not have happened if Donald Trump didn't do any of that.
[40:58.000 --> 41:07.000]  Sure, absolutely. They're blaming him for their failure and not funding races, right? And that's very, very clear. My question is to Roger Stone and then to you, we come back.
[41:07.000 --> 41:26.000]  Roger, how do we extricate ourselves as the populist bullwark trying to save this country by taking over the Republican Party? How do we not let the establishment distract us with the DeSantis-Trump civil war and actually focus on getting rid of the neocon leadership of the House and Senate?
[41:26.000 --> 41:36.000]  Well, first of all, we need to focus on trying to get control of one branch of government. We still don't know who won this U.S. Senate race or the governorship in Arizona.
[41:36.000 --> 41:45.000]  We still don't know who won the U.S. Senate race in Nevada. We still were going to a sudden death runoff, I think, in Georgia.
[41:45.000 --> 42:01.000]  Right now, what I'd like to see in all honesty is, Governor DeSantis got $150 million in his federal pack. How much is he sending to Herschel Walker? Donald Trump has got tens of millions of dollars in his federal pack. How much is he sending to Herschel Walker?
[42:01.000 --> 42:08.000]  That's what I was saying earlier. We should see the Republicans all behind Herschel Walker right now. We're hearing almost nothing.
[42:08.000 --> 42:26.000]  And meanwhile, Raphael Warnock, who's an extreme leftist, you remember him, the guy who ran over his wife with a car, but then accuses Herschel Walker being mentally unbalanced, that guy's taken in $50 million since Election Day.
[42:26.000 --> 42:41.000]  $50 million. We need to focus on the short-term battle ahead. Right now, the House and the Senate are up for grabs. We need to stop fighting amongst ourselves and focus on that.
[42:41.000 --> 42:55.000]  At the same time, Trump's no fool. He sees Ben Shapiro, Paul Ryan, Jeb Bush, Frank Luntz, Meghan McCain, Rick Wilson. Suddenly, they're all cheerleaders for Ron DeSantis. What's that all about, Alex?
[42:55.000 --> 43:00.000]  Well, I agree. It doesn't look good. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[43:00.000 --> 43:17.000]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness Company, an alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.

[44:13.000 --> 44:30.000]  Think about how Info Wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bal Senaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[44:30.000 --> 44:44.000]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show. I don't take the credit. I give you the credit.

[47:35.000 --> 47:41.000]  So Roger just keeps getting t-boned in the middle of nowhere.

[48:46.000 --> 48:53.000]  I remember you were t-boned just a few years ago. This is getting a little bit suspicious. Tell us what happened.
[48:53.000 --> 49:02.000]  Well, Alex, I'm glad you raise it because I know my wife posted something about it on Instagram and I have been overwhelmed by people wanting to know if I'm okay.
[49:02.000 --> 49:10.000]  First of all, I feel blessed. I clearly have the protection of the Lord. I've now had miracle number five in my life.
[49:10.000 --> 49:23.000]  I was on my way to the Frank Speech Studios to do my regular four o'clock central, five o'clock eastern show, The Stone Zone, which people can see by going to stonezone.live.
[49:23.000 --> 49:37.000]  I was with two security guys in a SUV supplied by the folks at Frank Speech. They took a left hand turn and some guy in a pickup truck blew a red light at about 55 miles an hour.
[49:37.000 --> 49:53.000]  T-boned us. Fortunately, the driver of my car saw this early jammed on the brakes and they didn't hit the rear passenger door on the right side where I was sitting or perhaps I wouldn't be with you on infowars today.
[49:53.000 --> 50:04.000]  So I thank Jesus Christ once again for protecting me. I'm fine. There's no reason to believe a political motive. The guy wasn't wearing a Black Lives Matter t-shirt.
[50:04.000 --> 50:10.000]  They didn't find a copy. The memory serves. Did you just get t-boned like a year and a half ago?
[50:10.000 --> 50:18.000]  I was longer than that. And of course, we never learned who that was. In other words, whoever struck the car didn't do so much damage to their own car.
[50:18.000 --> 50:28.000]  They were able to back up and pull away and the local police were never able to identify who had done that. So it remains unsolved to say the least.
[50:28.000 --> 50:35.000]  In this case, I don't think there was a political motive, but I really feel really blessed to be alive.
[50:35.000 --> 50:45.000]  Airbags went off. The car was completely total. The two security guys I were with had minor injuries, had to be stitched up.
[50:45.000 --> 50:51.000]  There was quite a bit of blood, but I didn't have a scratch. I didn't even have whiplash.
[50:51.000 --> 51:01.000]  Well, just then they took one for the team and slammed on the brakes. Getting back to where you were, and I want to get Owen's take on the Trump DeSantis rift that the Republican Party and Democrats are trying to create.
[51:01.000 --> 51:14.000]  And I get why Trump weighed in at this point. The whole system is getting behind DeSantis. I like DeSantis in his actions, but it's pretty creepy to have the whole establishment, including the Lincoln-Pito project, getting behind him.
[51:14.000 --> 51:27.000]  Yeah, look, I can understand this from President Trump's point of view. People need to be reminded of history. Ron DeSantis was a completely unknown Congressman who was not the choice of the Republican establishment.
[51:27.000 --> 51:38.000]  And every single Republican county chairman, all 67 in Florida, endorsed Ron's opponent. Every single Republican state legislator endorsed Ron's opponent.
[51:38.000 --> 51:48.000]  Congressman Matt Gaetz, I think, played an instrumental role in convincing President Trump to endorse Ron DeSantis.
[51:48.000 --> 51:56.000]  Notably, Congressman Gaetz has made it very clear in a DeSantis-Trump contest, Matt Gaetz is for Donald Trump.
[51:56.000 --> 52:04.000]  So I think it is an act of disloyalty. For those who say, oh, Stone, you and your friends are all creating this, no. There was a debate.
[52:04.000 --> 52:13.000]  The question was put to Ron DeSantis three times. Are you going to fulfill the four years of your new term, or will you run for president?
[52:13.000 --> 52:18.000]  And he docked. I've been in politics long enough to know when someone's evading the question.
[52:18.000 --> 52:30.000]  Okay, well, let's get a final take from Owen. Then I'm going to get back to what you said about we need to focus on the races they're trying to steal for control of the Senate right now, with a limited time with Roger Stone, ahead of Gavin McGinnis and others coming up.
[52:30.000 --> 52:33.000]  But, Owen, you've got some other points or questions.
[52:33.000 --> 52:45.000]  Well, let's just get back to what we're seeing moving forward here with these races. If the Republican Party does not address what we all saw as the issue ahead of these midterms, it doesn't matter who's going to run.
[52:45.000 --> 52:58.000]  It doesn't matter if it's Trump or DeSantis, they're never going to win. Because until the Republican Party focuses in and figures out what the hell is going on in Philadelphia, what the hell is going on in Atlanta, what the hell is going on in Phoenix,
[52:58.000 --> 53:12.000]  what the hell is going on in these major cities, Chicago, you name it, where Democrats get 70%, 80%, sometimes in New York, 90% of the vote, until Republicans address that issue and try to mitigate those margins.
[53:12.000 --> 53:20.000]  I don't see them winning anything, quite frankly. I just don't see how it happens with these margins that are coming in from these major cities. Do they trust the results?
[53:20.000 --> 53:29.000]  Is that just because Republicans just have abandoned the major cities? They don't even bother? Is it voter fraud? Is it election fraud? I don't know. They won't look into it, and so they never have a chance.
[53:29.000 --> 53:40.000]  And then in these state elections, they just get overwhelmed. I mean, New York is a perfect example. If you take out New York City, the state of New York is red, and it's not even close.
[53:40.000 --> 53:51.000]  Absolutely. Alex Royer, host of the War Room, 3 p.m. Central. Great job. Thank you so much for your continued analysis. So join us again coming up throughout the next few days and next week with the latest numbers.
[53:51.000 --> 54:02.000]  So getting back to what you said earlier, Roger, what do we do right now with them trying to steal these key battleground areas in Arizona, in Nevada, Georgia coming up? What do we do?
[54:02.000 --> 54:15.000]  Well, first of all, Georgia, we need to fight it out. I mean, this is unbelievable, Alex, but Governor Brian Kemp, the Rhino, got a higher percentage of the African American vote than Herschel Walker did.
[54:15.000 --> 54:25.000]  That's because Herschel Walker's campaign made no effort among African American voters, which is crazy because he's a sports legend, and he could have done better.
[54:25.000 --> 54:38.000]  He didn't go to black churches. He didn't buy any urban or gospel radio. I mean, that's insanity. So we need to refocus on persuasion, not just turnout in Georgia.
[54:38.000 --> 54:52.000]  I'd like to see Governor DeSantis and President Trump focus the millions of dollars they have on hand to pulling Herschel Walker, who I think, by the way, really took a lot of hits and kept right on pushing forward across the finish line.
[54:52.000 --> 55:00.000]  He can win, but we have to watch the machinery again. And we have to be prepared to go to court more aggressively.
[55:00.000 --> 55:04.000]  Mike Lindell has done a fabulous job of documenting the theft.
[55:04.000 --> 55:21.000]  Secondarily, I must tell you, I don't have high hopes for Adam Laxalt, who I like very much in Nevada. The outstanding votes we haven't counted are from Harry Reid's stronghold, Clark County. Last time I saw Adam Laxalt was up by a hair.
[55:21.000 --> 55:38.000]  Michelle Fiori, a good friend of mine, a city councilwoman in Las Vegas running for state treasurer. She was up by about 8,000. How coincidental? Joe Lombardo, the Republican candidate for governor, the sheriff, who covered up the Las Vegas shooting.
[55:38.000 --> 55:49.000]  Excellent reporting by Laura Loomer, among others about that. He's a machine creature. Why is he running so much further in all these Democratic strongholds than Adam Laxalt?
[55:49.000 --> 56:05.000]  I don't have high hopes for Nevada. And lastly, I really do believe that Kerry Lake, and there's the future of the Republican Party, Kerry Lake, and Mark Fincham, the candidate for secretary of state that controls the machinery and election, and Blake Masters running for the U.S. Senate,
[56:05.000 --> 56:20.000]  I do believe that they will finally, when all the votes are counted, pull out victory in Arizona. But Alex, why is this taking so long? Why is this taking so long? In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[56:20.000 --> 56:34.000]  Why can't we do this here? The answer is fraud and corruption. And Owen is absolutely right. If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSentimonious.
[56:34.000 --> 56:50.000]  But they're going to deny us Michigan. They're going to deny us Pennsylvania. They're going to deny us Arizona. And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is an America first majority in every single one of them.
[56:50.000 --> 57:07.000]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system. Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else. Communications are the reason why we didn't well. That's why infowars.com is so damn important. That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[57:07.000 --> 57:24.000]  People need to get behind infowars, get behind the stonezone.com, get behind Frankspeak. This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important. We need more of this communications, not less.
[57:24.000 --> 57:31.000]  Roger Stone, thank you so much. Continue to join us as we track this in the days and weeks to come. Thank you so much.
[57:31.000 --> 57:35.000]  God bless you, Alex. I'm just happy and blessed to be alive.
[57:35.000 --> 57:40.000]  Yes, sir. We're very glad you're still with us. All right, we're going to come back with Gavin McGuinness, a ton of breaking news.
[57:40.000 --> 57:45.000]  And I'm going to play a little five minute clip of Harris County, Texas, and the fraud.
[57:45.000 --> 58:10.000]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now. They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[58:10.000 --> 58:22.000]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is infowars because we know the globalist number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them down peacefully.
[58:22.000 --> 58:29.000]  We've got great products that fund the operation that also are incredibly powerful and the highest quality for your immune system and more.

[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:21.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  Investigating the facts and as those facts are developed, we will, if those facts support what we believe to be the truth, follow lawsuit and we will have a day of reckoning in the room for Administrative Tatum and all of his folks.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  Why would it be at the only places that our investigation has shown thus far to not have enough paper to vote? Republican stronghold precincts?
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  One would think if it's just a simple administrative screw up, we don't have enough paper for the entire election, that that screw up would be all over the Democratic precincts as well.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  And yet, so far we've found 23 precincts that didn't have paper. Guess what? All 23 are Republican strongholds.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  That ought to tell you something. That makes me suspect that this wasn't just a colossal failure. This was intentional.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  And we're going to take this investigation wherever it leads and we will file the appropriate paperwork.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  Now I want to turn our attention to what happened today. We had a hearing in front of the judge. We're talking about mail-in ballots.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  We're told that there are about 200 mail-in ballots that have yet to be counted and we talked about the process by which those should be counted.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  We have another hearing tonight in front of the judge said at 8 o'clock and if necessary, we'll be back in front of the court again at 9.30 in the morning.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  So stay tuned and know what's going to happen with those mail-in ballots.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  I want to make the public aware, though, that there is something coming up that is colossally important to the outcome of these races.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  It's called provisional ballots.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  Provisional ballots are for voters who show up and for whatever reason they get flagged.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  There's something wrong with that particular voter's credentials.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  And so rather than just turn them away, they're allowed to vote, but they vote provisionally.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  Then what happens is the early voting ballot board will look at those provisional ballots one by one to decide should they count or should they not count.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  Well, unfortunately, the administrator, Mr. Tatum, has found a way to screw that up, too.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  So he went to court and he asked the court to allow the additional hour of voting from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  Every single one of those persons is supposed to vote provisionally.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  And within about an hour, the Texas Supreme Court spanked that request that Tatum had made and said that is not what the law says.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  You're supposed to do it the way the election code requires, and now you're going to have to segregate all of those ballots.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  We're talking about thousands and thousands and thousands of ballots that were cast after 7 o'clock.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  Well, what does that mean for the candidates whose political election stakes are going to be governed by that decision?
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  Here's what I told the judge in court tonight.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  We need to create two piles of provisional ballots.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  One pile is everybody who voted before 7.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  The other file is everybody who voted after 7.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  And then once those are looked at and for the...
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  It's November 2022, and that means our historic biggest sale of the year is now live at infowarstore.com.

[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  You're insane with all the stuff going on in this world.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:00.000]  If you don't boost your immune system, plus it keeps us on air, I win-win.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:42.000]  Yeah, McGinnis is joining us coming up in the next segment of the Breakdown, the incredible midterm fiasco.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:53.000]  We just witnessed and so much more other special guests, but I wanted to keep people focused on who's actually behind all of this before we look at the latest,
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  extremely shady behavior in places like Maricopa County, where they put hundreds of sheriffs on the roof, barbed wire, fences up, drones flying around harassing journalists,
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  and cameras go dark at Vote Counting Facility in Key, Nevada County, and now in other counties in the middle of the night.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  They don't just put up the boards over things, the cameras go out when the special trucks pull up, they're doing it again.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  But it's important to realize what's happening at the grassroots is being directed publicly by the Bilderberg Group,
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  which is the secret global consortium that we first blew open worldwide thanks to our listeners getting the intel and sharing it.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  Jim Tucker and others first broke it decades and decades ago and did an incredible job, better than us, being the real trailblazers.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  But it was this audience and Drudge Report back when Drudge was on the team blowing it open and making them admit Bilderberg existed.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000]  The World Economic Forum is founded out of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000]  Klaus Schwab has been on their steering committee and it's the mouth of these people.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  So whether it's Bill Gates or whether it's George Soros or whether it's Klaus Schwab, they're all the same people.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  King Charles III, known as Prince Charles, all of them.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  There's a few of these key clips, give me some background on this.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  Here's globalist, Kingpin George Soros, who openly admits he wants China to lead the New World Order,
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  donating $128 million to Democrats this year alone that we know of. Here it is.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  This would be the time because you really need to bring China into the creation of a new world order, financial world order.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  World order, financial world order with the casual society, all of it run by them.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  But notice they're already double crossing each other, so now Soros says China's Hitler.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  Well, China's pretty bad, but it didn't actually work for Hitler like you did, buddy.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  Carbon is moving very quickly into a system where it's going to be very close to a currency.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  Next, we start thinking about putting prices on water, on trees, on biodiversity.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  How do we start tokenizing?
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  So, computer scanning and tracking everything you do, a total prison, selectively deciding who can have businesses who can't.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  They'll all be above the law. This is Michael Sheeran, former Bank of England top advisor.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  Currently at the Big Global Government Summit in the Middle East, in North Africa.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  They're in Egypt that Biden's at. We've got some more clips of that in a moment, but here he is.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  So central banks are also starting to understand nature has real value.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  Carbon, we already figured out.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  And carbon is moving very quickly into a system where it's going to be very close to a currency.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  Basically, being able to take a ton of absorbed or sequestered carbon,
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  and being able to create a forward pricing curve with financial service architecture documentation.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  I just came out of a meeting this morning, how we're trying to accelerate that.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  To be quite honest, not to get very boring, but we're on financial topics and things,
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  but they're going to be derivatives, and you need is the documentation if you want to trade a derivative in the marketplace.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  And all this actually matters for nature as well.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  Oh, yes.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  I'm going to quickly hand off, but again, I want to talk about value one more time,
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  because the southern part of the world has value far greater than large elements of the northern part.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  And we start thinking about and putting prices on water, on trees, on biodiversity.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  We find, where does that sit?
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  I'm doing a lot of work out of Asia, and I say that my next door neighbor, Indonesia,
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  is the left lung of the world, and obviously Brazil's the right, and Africa, absolutely critical.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  And we need their natural capital as a system-based world,
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  more than we need that 66 billion we've got sitting in the basement of the Bank of England.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  So how do we, and I'm hoping this discussion today, at least from a central banker's point of view, and how do we start tokenizing,
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  how do we start building systems that actually create not only the value, but transfer that value around the world?
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  Oh, yes.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  Oh, they're transferring my third world that they control to the IMF and World Bank.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  And now they count for the trees, the animals, they vote for them, you don't have a vote anymore.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  That's their admitted plan.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  And then they list all of these things that are life-giving, like carbon dioxide, as a poison.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  So they can regulate it and surveil it, as he said, and control it.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  What a nightmare situation they're pushing.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  Here's Larry McDonald, who's a super patriot, Democrat, by the way,
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  final interview before they forced his plane down and executed him.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  They claim it was shot down over North Korea and over Russia.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  Here he is on national news, talking about the New World Order.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  This week says that the John Birch Society considers communism only one arm of a master conspiracy
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  in which socialist American insiders are plotting to establish world government.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  Now, he also says, and here's director John McManus, that's your public relations director,
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  saying that former Secretary of State Alexander Haig and CIA director William Casey
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  are two of these master conspirators who are plotting to establish world government.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  Now, what do you say?
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  That kind of silly, asinine statement is what makes people laugh at the John Birch Society.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  Well, Tom, I'm sure being a long-standing member of the Rockefeller Apparattoch
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  and as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations of Long-Standing,
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  you're fully aware that there is an elitist core in this country that has seen value
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  in subsidizing communism, of protecting communism.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  It has? Sure.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  You're accusing me of subsidizing communism?
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  No, no, I'm saying that because I haven't belonged to it.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  No, there is an elite core.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  There is an elite core in this country that has dominated American society.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  Well, I'm not one of them.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  The Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  Here's what they've done.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  Well, let's face it.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  They've dominated the State Department for 40 years and pretty much openly so.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  But what are they trying to do?
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  Well, their objective is to try to bring about a gradual transition in our society,
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  a dissolving of sovereignty and a moving steadily to the left on the political spectrum.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  But who are they?
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  The elite of groups that I mentioned, particularly key individuals and policymakers
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  and the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  Is the International Monetary Fund part of this?
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  Well, I would say the International Monetary Fund has certainly been set up for the purpose
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  of facilitating that transfer of sovereignty and transfer of wealth on the road.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  Well, we elected Mr. Consul.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  Let me just finish the point because otherwise we're going to have a lot of unanswered questions
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  that you are looking at a group that has worked to bring about a dissolution of national sovereignty
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  on the road to world government.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  Certainly you're familiar with the local professor, Carol Quigley, who has been part of your club,
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  in which he admitted all this and he said in his book, Tragedy and Hope,
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  the only thing I disagree is that we've worked to keep it a secret.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  So you just heard the Bank of England guys say we're going to transfer all the wealth
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  out of the north to the south because there's more life in the south.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  And it's all about control.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  Take your money and enslave them.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  And now Biden's bumbling around at the new Paris Agreement 2.0,
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  promising all of this to transfer our wealth to the globalists,
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  not to the poor people who have had their lockdown for years.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  Here's a few of the clubs just came out today.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  Against this backdrop, it's more urgent than ever that we double down on our climate commitments.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  Russia's war only enhances the urgency of the need to transition the world off its dependence on fossil fuels.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  But our significant climate investment will, quote,
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  help turbocharge the emerging global clean energy.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  Turbo means fuel.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  I was reading their quote, sorry.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  Injected with air.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  Passion and new diplomatic expertise have been absolutely critical.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  Absolutely critical, delivering incredible progress on climate issues over the past two years.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  Progress.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  Thank you, pal.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  Thank you for being my friend.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  We immediately rejoined the Paris Agreement.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  We convened major climate summits and reestablished climate dictatorship, the total surveillance.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  I apologize, never pulled out of the agreement.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  Total depopulation is the plan.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  That was a jam-packed segment.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  How green means to murder you and your family.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  Now, the carbon tax will prevail every area of your life and literally put you in a prison.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  We arrive back with Gavin McGinnis. Stay with us.

[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence info wars because they rightly see us
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America,
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000]  but the world, to the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.

[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.

[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:06.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  And we are back live on this Friday, November 11th, 2022, broadcast in defiance of the censors trying to silence us.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:24.000]  Gavin McGinnis is our guest for the Balanced The Hour to talk about the midterms, the fraud we witnessed,
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  this new rift between Trump and the Santas, the carbon taxes, the New World Order, the open borders, the war in Ukraine,
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000]  the insanity going on.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:43.000]  He is the host of a very popular show at censor.tv. The founder of Vice and so much more needs introduction.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000]  Gavin, thank you so much for being on with us, my friend. We didn't talk before you came on.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:53.000]  I threw out kind of a plethora of things to hit, but what's front and center for you, my friend?
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  A new phenomenon I'm calling terrorism. It's terrorism from a chair. I had a show in Rutherford, New Jersey last night,
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:11.000]  and Antifa found out about it. They just terrorized with their thumbs the venue owner, the chief of police, the mayor,
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  and they don't have to show up. No one left their chair for any of this, but the mayor got spooked.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  He called the chief of police who told the venue to shut it down, and they did. Everyone capitulated with just tweets and texts
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  and messages, and these people are not even from New York or New Jersey. They're from all over the country,
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  so Antifa is terrorizing people from their chairs, and these pussies are happily folding.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  Remember, you were on the list of 12 people three years ago when Facebook came out after our purge five years ago
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:52.000]  and said, there are now people called dangerous persons who you're not allowed to say nice things about,
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.000]  or you're going to be censored, but you're allowed to call for violence against them. That's a quote in their rules.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:04.000]  It was Loose Faircon, Gavin McGinnis, Paul Joseph Watson, Alex Jones, and a few others. What an elite group.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  If you're expanding that out, then the ADLs on the news saying, anybody we call a dangerous person will have their bank account taken.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000]  So you talk about the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany. This is it.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  Well, at least in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, there was some pushback. Like, the right is just happily taken.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:27.000]  I said to the venue owner last night, Chuck, the place is called the Well. I said, dude, what they're doing is illegal.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  You can't shut down someone's constitutional right for free speech on the premise of public safety.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:38.000]  And that's racketeering when the mob would say, you better pay me extra money or somebody's going to burn down your nightclub.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000]  You don't give in to them. This is mafia tactics.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:46.000]  Yeah, that's exactly what I said. And I'm suing the city of Rutherford. So Antifa is making me money.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  We're going to do the show tonight on Long Island. But my anger isn't really at Antifa.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:58.000]  They're mentally ill, lonely people, fat, ugly girls with purple hair and bad tattoos. They're always going to want to wreck your fun.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:04.000]  My problem is with the mayor and the chief of police in these venues that fold like that from tweets.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  I go, I said to the cop last night, the chief of police, John Russo, I said, dude, your boss is a fat girl's thumbs.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  And he said, yeah, it's a sad state of affairs. I go, sad state of affairs. You're the affairs. You're the guy.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  Well, you know what Rudder Kipling said, when you feed the pirate once, he always comes back over and over again until the price is too high.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  Don't they get, you don't give in to terrorists?
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  It's, it's pretty logical. I mean, you don't have to look up any books. You don't have to look at any historical references.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:39.000]  If someone sends a tweet that says, I'm going to get you, you don't go, OK, well, then I'm shutting down everything.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  Remember that movie, the interview with what's James Franco and Seth Rogen. They're making fun of Kim Jong-un in it.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.000]  Yes.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:53.000]  There was an email sent that may have come from Kim Jong-un. He never, he never qualified it.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  So Hollywood panicked and pulled the film.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  Hold the film. It wasn't, we're, we're at the behest of an email. This is the same thing.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  Like you should have had the National Guard at theaters and made sure that movie, even if two people showed up, it, that movie should have been.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  Oh, I mean, it should have been on every channel in the country if it was true that a dictator said, don't air it.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  Exactly. That's America, but not now. Now we have a mayor. I was shocked to see the mayor as a man, too.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  A man with an Italian name, a Frank Zenuto or something. We have men, men who fought for this country.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  Brave men, the police, the mayor, they're supposed to have our backs and they're at the behest of a fat chicken Portland with, with nervies, with twitchy thumbs.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  Where do we go from here?
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  We just have to keep fighting, you know, like a woodchuck. Just keep, if you domesticate a beaver, he'll just start eating your furniture because that's the beaver's dip.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  We're just going to keep fighting. We're going to keep gnawing away at the wood. The show is going to happen tonight.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  I'm suing Penn State. Did you hear about this? Alex Stein and I had a talk at Penn State.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  He goes outside and they spit on him. They attack him. Proud boys show up. They don't fight. They do the civil rights thing. Proud boys getting pounded in the face.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  The radicals are pepper spraying or they're attacking cops. I think like complete lunatics and the Penn State says, oh, you're causing too much trouble.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  You're too violent. We're canceling the show. And it's a public university. So I'm suing Rutherford, New Jersey, and I'm suing Penn State.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  And Tifa's making me tons of cash.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  It's crazy what's going on. What's your take on the midterms and this whole Trump to Santa's rift?
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  Well, with the midterms, I'm a real chatty Cathy. I talk to cab drivers and painters and the guy on the street.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  It takes me like an hour to go buy a coffee because I'm talking to so many people. And amongst the sort of working class New Yorkers,
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  the general consensus is, look, Kerry Lake, Walker, that's politics as usual. We lost. It's disappointing. It's like being a Mets fan, whatever.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  But Fetterman. You just have to go to people in a mega hat and just say, Fetterman. And they look back at you and go,
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  like, we're all gobsmacked. What the hell? Is this the monarchy where they have like little Lord Fauntleroy, a 12 year old?
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  I think there was some guy who made, I think it was Nero who made a horse.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  What?
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  Yeah, but it was Caligula married his horse.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  Yeah, like that's where we're at now. No one on earth or even outside of earth would see Fetterman and go, yep.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  Yeah, Caligula made the horse the head of the Senate and married it.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  Yeah, that's where we're at. Are they gloating? Like I don't understand.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  I think they are. I mean, nothing against disabled people, but Fetterman is literally like a Mad Max character.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  He's literally like King of the Mutants or something out of escape from New York.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  Dude, if he was your Uber driver, you'd say, oh, I'm sorry. I made a mistake. It's actually right here. I'm right here. I got to get out here.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  Like you jump out at the next stop sign. I'm not exaggerating.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  And have you seen all the videos on MSNBC seeing him or the women get all excited and say he needs to be our next president?
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  So that's the new prerequisitor that you can't talk.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  That's all part of the head shake. Like they're not even going, oops, they're going, yes, that was great. Let's keep running him.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  Let's run him and his neck bulge all the way to the White House.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  And you're like the other ones I'm very dubious about, but this is like unprecedented.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  We've never had a mentally, I mean, Joe Biden is clearly has dementia, but we've never had someone with a brain so rotten.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  Like even with Biden, with the debate with Trump, he wasn't terrible. His brain has gone in the past since he's become president.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:42.000]  We've really seen the decay. Fetterman ran on decayed mind and won by a landslide. What? What is going on?
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  Look, I should be happy. It's good content.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  No, it certainly is. I've got a lot of questions, but I've thrown it out there twice. You haven't responded.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  So when we come back, what do you make of the Republican Party joining the Democrats trying to create this Republican civil war between Trump and the Senate?
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  It seems very cynical. It seems demonic. It seems evil.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  And then the New York Post is all on board and they're often wrong about things like they wanted Eric Adams.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  I don't understand the rift and this, this whole idea that he ruined Oz and everyone he endorses becomes an anvil in the water.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  I don't, I mean, maybe I don't know enough about politics, but when I see the polls, I see Trump at 50 and DeSantis at 11.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  So why are we ignoring our front runner? Why are you throwing him out?
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  Trump energizes the base. I'm mad about the shots, but what he does there is so good. The numbers are he's still overall a plus.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  The system doesn't want Trump because he's coughing nails for them.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  And everyone assumes DeSantis wants to run. I don't think he wants to run. I think he'll run in maybe 10 years.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  Yeah, I think they're trying to draft him right now. This whole process is let's talk about that more with Gavin McGinnis and we'll also just talk about all the rest of the leftist insanity and so much more. Stay with us.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:15.000]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now. They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians.
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  It's not just in America, but worldwide. And their number one most hated enemy in the media is Info Wars because we know the globalist number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them down peacefully.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  We've got great products that fund the operation that also are incredibly powerful and the highest quality for your immune system and more.

[01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:12.000]  It's our best seller. We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller. But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:28.000]  And it's been sold out for a while but it's finally back in stock. Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body. It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:39.000]  Essential means without these things you die. And so much of the food is debased. There's so many chemicals in the environment. It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:54.000]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there. But this is amongst the very best and it's a low price and it funds the info war. So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally back in stock at infowarstore.com for a 50% off.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:11.000]  Think about a world without info wars. Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together. This family that is info wars.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:28.000]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:38.000]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:46.000]  I don't take the credit. I give you the credit. And now info wars is facing its darkest hours. It isn't going to give up.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:33:09.000]  Without your support, we can be shut down. Please go to saveinfowars.com today. Saveinfowars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  So it was about six years ago. A little more than six years ago. Trump was about to be elected. And Gavin McGinnis was on with me on a marathon show.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:37.000]  And I said, what is the peak of SJW leftist insanity? And he said, I don't think there is any peak. They just go on to destroy everything or we stop them.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  And now we see that with pushing nuclear war, pushing pedophilia, just anything nihilistic and destructive they go for.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  And then the rest of us that are productive and leading normal lives, we just sent here trying to compartmentalize ourselves. They're not going to let us do that.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.000]  So he wants to get to the border, the crime, the attack on the police, and also what's next?
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  Ask Gavin in the break. What do you want to hit next? Well, what about what's coming next? Because what are they going to do next? That's the big question, Gavin.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  I think we have a really crazy time coming up. I'm confident that we get the Senate after the special election in Georgia.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  So December 9th, we have the House and the Senate. I don't think DeSantis is going to run. Trump is going to run.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  But I think Biden might beat him because women voters, sorry, but they're too emotional. They're going to get hung up on abortion.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  And they're going to go, I know Biden has dementia, but I want to give him a second term, a second chance.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  And I don't want my daughter to have to keep the baby. So let's give Biden another run at it.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  So that's the bad news. The good news is we'll have the House and Senate and this polluted mind of Joe Biden will be relatively feckless.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  But when that happens, the left is going to go nuts.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  I mean, just like you said before this, they have no limits.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  Imagine, remember when we heard about radical Islam and we go, oh, they generally mutilate their children.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  They give them clitoral circumcision. And in Saudi Arabia, they don't want any gays, so they force them to have sex changes.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  And we would go, what a horrible culture that is. That's nothing now. That's us.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  We are okay with a double mastectomy for a 14-year-old girl.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  And that's not like, you know, cutting off your finger. There's a lot of machinery in there.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  It's a very complicated operation. You look at the scars and they look like caesarean scars.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  It's depraved what we're doing. And I think they've only just begun.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  I agree. So only just begun. What does that signify?
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  Well, we've seen in other regimes they control what comes next. And I think China is the model.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  What we see in China is what's already coming here and what we're going to become.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  You know what we see in China is a total lack of love. We see a total disregard for the family.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  These people have kids. They give them to the grandparents and then they're gone 10 months of the year.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  Chinese New Year is the only time parents see their kids. They take like a month or two off.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  But 10 months a year, they're working seven days a week nonstop like drones.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  Maybe Mao, with the Great Leap Forward, killed everyone creative and romantic and nice.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  And now it's just these attack of the Clone Wars drones. And that's what the elites want from us.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  They want us to eat bugs, live in the cube, be separated from our children, not have children, ideally.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  And that seemed far-fetched. But now, like, sorry, to go back to Islam, we said these Muslims are torturing their children.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  Now we have Muslim immigrants in Dearborn, Michigan going to school meetings and saying,
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  stop with the porn in the schools and stop making my little boy or girl you are depraved.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  So radical female circumcisers are now saying, whoa, slow it down, America.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  You guys are committing child abuse. And now with open borders, we're going to have no limits to this.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  We've got people who have no standards, meaning the left, and then they're inviting in the worst of the third world to carry out their bidding.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:14.000]  I mean, dude, I think we're looking at an apocalypse where every city is worse than Philadelphia.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  And every rural area is like the white farmers in South Africa just gilded to the max with razor wire and guns.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  I can't believe we got here.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  Well, that's what we've seen in the third world. So you've said it, a merger of Communist China with, say, Venezuela.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  I think that's kind of what we're looking at.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  Yeah, I see a lot of South Africa, too, with the affirmative action in the New York City Police Department.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000]  Oh, I agree. That's the real mix, exactly.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  I mean, the top brass of the police department is all black, and they're not black because they were hardworking.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  They're black because they know Eric Adams.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  See, Eric Adams, our New York mayor here, he asks for eight by tens with every resume.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  He probably doesn't even read.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  He just goes, oh, black person, black person, black.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  I mean, you look at the cabinet now or the top brass at NYPD, and it's like, shoot the ball.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  Shoot to kill. We are living in Soweto now.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  And they're all incompetent, too.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  Like if Lee Zeldin had won, there was hope for New York, but it's raging incompetence.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  But I totally agree with you because one thing, a lot of black liberals really aren't racist.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  They go along with the whole narrative of divide and conquer.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  But with the mayor of New York, he literally is a black supremacist.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  And then, I mean, the stuff he does is just insane.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  Crime here is insane. You should see the subways here in New York.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  No one has their AirPods on. No one's looking at their phone. We're all like this.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  We're all poised. We're on our haunches. Our backs are to the wall.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:50.000]  We're reading that ridership on its down almost 40%. I mean, it literally is a hellhole.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  Yeah. Would you rather spend a little bit extra on a taxi or be thrown in front of a train or get sliced?
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  There's knives everywhere. And these guys know they're not going to jail. So why not?
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  I think the only person that would go to jail would be the Bernie Getz who pulls out his gun to defend himself.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  I had him as a guest once. So let's talk about that.
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  Plus, why Soros put in all the DAs while they're in this? To collapse civilization. If they're able to do it,
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  what do they build on top of it with their build back better?
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  They really have no regard for the cities. They've just given up. The cities are like prisons now.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  It's like escape from New York. All of Manhattan is just rikers now.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  And the elites are fine with that because they don't really go to New York City.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  They're in Chappaqua with the Clintons and they're in the Hamptons.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  Yeah, so Martha's Vineyard. So they just sort of see the cities as breeding grounds for drones.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  That's a great point. I mean, when only like 50 illegal aliens got shipped to Martha's Vineyard,
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  send alarm fire. Oh, we love you. They bust them out the next day.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  And you know what's crazy about that? If you ask someone from Martha's Vineyard, they'd say,
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  yeah, the right tried to terrorize us and we took them in, we embraced them, we fed them, we clothed them,
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  and we blew it up. We showed them that they can't try to trick us.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  And you're like, so you see it as a win because I see it as a win.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  I see it as I expose you. You sent them all to a military warehouse to sleep on cots after, what, 30 hours.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  And they're like, no, we took them in, we fed them and clothed them and it went great.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  That's the crazy thing about this Soros division. We both look at the same thing and we both see it as a success.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  Like Federman, I think that's a great example of how the left has no idea what they're doing.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  Just like AOC is a clown. Just like AOC is a clown, but they embrace her.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:46.000]  They love her. They think she's doing really well. They love Biden.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  And I'm not even mad at this point. Like when I see a Biden bumper sticker, I speed up because I want to look in
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  and see the person. I'm fascinated by them. Who are you? What planet are you living on?
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  No, I do the exact same thing. And they usually look like an evil spider sucked their soul.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  They usually look like some kind of bizarre zombie. I mean, these are scary people.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.000]  And, you know, a lot of this too is the media's fault.
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  Like if you only heard about Federman from MSNBC, they don't show the clips where he calls the satchel of liberty, the liberty of statues.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  They don't show, they don't focus on the fact he said, hello, good night, everybody.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  They get it all that out. First thing he says to the debate, good night.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  And then he also says, I support getting rid of Roe v. Wade. That's my main mission.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:38.000]  I mean, he literally doesn't know what planet he's on, which is why he's the model of the future, like Biden is,
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  because these forces are behind him. The puppet gets the blame and the globalists never get in trouble.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  And they just put up more and more. So I think they'll probably start having like, they may start running people in comas for office.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  Well, the bright side of this is, if you're remotely curious and you look up something, you can quickly see that the narrative is light years from what you've been told.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  And once they get a hold of that one thread, it unravels the whole sweater.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  Like there was this girl, Nia, something in Oakland, and she was melting off to some mentally ill career criminal.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  So he stabbed her and then he was arrested. Okay, horrible story. Watch who you're talking to and someone could be psychotic and have a knife.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  The story became proud boys went hunting young black children. They killed a 13 year old girl for fun.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  And now they're going to a bar to celebrate. We should shut down that celebration because what they did was wrong.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  Like the reality and what the media is telling you are so far apart.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  So if you were to look up, say that one story and you go, wait, what? That's not even close to what happened.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  Then they start digging into other things.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  Hold on. Exactly. Stay right there. This is important. How we give people to start thinking.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  I'm pointing my finger at you. And I'm also pointing it right back at myself. You forget to take your multivitamins.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:13.000]  You forget to take your vitamin D3. You forget to take your brain force plus. You forget to take DNA force plus.

[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.000]  It's unsustainable. So please visit saveinfowarstore.com.

[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:04.000]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalist.
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but to the world.
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  But I don't deserve the credit. Yes, I've persevered.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  But the listeners and viewers who support in info wars are the real reason you have the success.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever had.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:34.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify it.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you. And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  because we are over the target and this streak is happening.

[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.000]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny.
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.000]  But when you fight tyranny, the new world order comes after you.
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:08.000]  Now, I knew that. And for 28 years I've been on air exposing these people.
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:12.000]  And together we've had a great effect. But listen, they're coming after us right now.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  They're trying to shut us down. But they can't beat the power of we the people, of you and I together.

[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:29.000]  All right. Sensor.tv is his website, his great daily show.
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  Got a lot of other great people on there with him.
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  Gavin McGinnis is our guest for one more segment.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:38.000]  Another special guest coming up next hour and a bunch of breaking news.
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  Gavin, I've got a couple other big questions for you, but let's get back to what we talked about before the break.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  How do you go to a leftist who's brainwashed by corporate media who's an establishment shill
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  when the whole New World Order on record wants to impoverish them, depopulate them,
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  dumb them down, all the evidence says they're out to get them, they admit they're out to get them,
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  but they're convinced they're on the winning team.
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  How do you convince them that they've been manipulated? How do you rehabilitate them?
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  Or do we just triage and not worry about them and try to motivate populist to conservatives
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  and free market people in common sense folks? What do we do?
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  Triage. We got to cut some people loose.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  I talked to a guy who worked with troubled youth in Philly and he said,
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  some guys that I can help and he goes, some of them I can just tell, you're just a bad egg
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  and I cannot help you. I got to cut you loose and focus on who I can help.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  And I think with the left, the incurious have always been there.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:38.000]  They've always been oblivious. They're Puritans, they're not interested in, it's their faith.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  And right now the faith of the Puritans is in the liberal causes.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  So Biden can go and rape kids, do whatever he wants. They will never leave him.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.000]  He is their Jesus. They've replaced religion with the DNC.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:54.000]  Let them go. There are some curious centrists though.
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  And the good news is, like that crazy story I told you before the break,
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  if you look that up, you see the truth and you start looking at other things.
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  And unlike say even 20 years ago, this information is there.
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  It's easy to find. So things have never been better for the curious.
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  The incurious, yes, they're cursed, but they've always been like that.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  That's nothing new.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  Wow. Let me get to a perspective with the globalist.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  They say the public are dumb animals that because the world doesn't have enough pressures on them
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  of the natural selection or enough predators or wars that they're doing us a favor
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  getting rid of the dumb people. But while the globalists work to dumb everybody down on top of it,
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  well, their answer is, well, that's natural pressure we're putting on.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.000]  But really it's just an excuse for them to act however they want.
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  But at a certain point, I'm stuck between the New World Order crushing me and the general masses
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  that won't wake up. It makes it really hard to not join the globalists,
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  which I'll never do because it's a spiritual decision and they're so horrible
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  and worse than some of the unwashed masses.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  But there is that paradox where it's frustrating to know what we know.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  We can easily have jobs with the enemy.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.000]  I mean, you've had some of the biggest publications. You create advice.
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  I know I've never asked you, but I guarantee you've been approached by the system to sell out.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  I've been approached countless times.
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:18.000]  It's frustrating that we're right. We know what we're talking about.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  We're trying to save people and a lot of them don't want to be saved.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  So how do we deal with that paradox?
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  Well, the good news is nature's on our side.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  You look up the future of these people like those girls who thumbed their way into the mayorship
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  of Rutherford, New Jersey last night and the chief of police.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  They're not having kids. Our children, Rex, isn't going to have to deal with these people
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  because they're not having kids. They're done.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  Future generations are not going to have these people.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  You look at secular Jews versus orthodox Jews and acidic Jews.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  The secular Jews are mostly liberal. The orthodox and the Hasidim tend to be right-wing.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  Only the orthodox and the Hasidim are having kids and they're having a lot of kids.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  The secular, I call them gynos, Jews in the name only, they're not having kids.
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  And that little microcosm is true of the entire country.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  The pro-family people are having families.
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  The anti-family people are self-committing ethnoside.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  I'm glad you raised that because I see Kanye West and I see Kari Irving,
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  and they all have their right to free speech and they make some points.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  But if you pull back, the idea that the liberals push that the Jews are one unified group
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:38.000]  or any Seminix push or whatever, anybody that's actually studied history or knows anything,
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  knows the leftist Jews, especially in Israel, are literally persecuting the ultra-orthodox,
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  as they're called, whether the Hasidic or just ultra-orthodox.
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:53.000]  And the ultra-orthodox are actually voting like 95% populist, conservative, pro-gun, pro-nationalist.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  So this Jew bashing doesn't make sense because actually studying politics and ethnic groups and subgroups,
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  I mean, the Jews are a religious ethnic consortium,
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  but they're actually in a bigger fight than Americans are over left versus right.
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  I mean, Israel is giving the Jews all the poison shots too.
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  And supposedly the grand masses are everything. Why are they not getting out on lockdowns and brutal injections?
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  No, they're being targeted by other Jews.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  And I also say to these people, I go, hey, hey, don't be so stingy with your hate.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000]  Spread that hate around. That's wonderful your hate. I love your hate.
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:30.000]  Spread it to Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  It's not the Jew York Times. Arthur Salzburger is an atheist.
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000]  You're not Jewish if you don't believe in God.
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  George Soros, not only is he an atheist, his father was an atheist.
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:46.000]  Soros worked with the Nazis. This is not the Jews are not your enemy, elites are your enemy.
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  And elites, especially white liberal elites, have this bizarre genetic trait where they want to destroy themselves.
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  And that's what I was getting at with the birthrate.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:59.000]  These leftist loonies are their own worst enemy.
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.000]  In their utopia, they're extinct.
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:07.000]  I remember when I lived in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, there was this guy walking around with a clipboard,
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  and he said, hey, we're signing a petition to stop the gentrification of this neighborhood.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:14.000]  And I was like, I'm the gentrification of this neighborhood.
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  And wait, so are you. You have a petition to get rid of yourself?
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.000]  And he goes, well, I mean, we certainly don't need more people like me around here.
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  And notice the left is externalizing their own internal projection.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000]  They hate themselves. They want to die.
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:34.000]  They think too many humans caught the pipelines, extinction, rebellion, destroyed civilization,
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  but they want us to do it first.
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  I'm like, no, walk the plank, hang yourself, burn yourself, blow yourself up.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:45.000]  If you want to, I'm not saying do it, but kill yourself first, then I'll respect you.
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:48.000]  Yeah, and they will happily do that.
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000]  I mean, you have women all over social media,
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  talking about how they're not having kids because they want to save the world.
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:58.000]  And you go, good, I'm glad you're ending your particular legacy because you suck.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  So I'm pretty optimistic about the future.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:05.000]  Although right now we have this bizarre globalization where, you know, cities are becoming hellholes
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  and everyone's retreating up to the suburbs, which the liberal locusts are then slowly destroying town by town
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  as they go up from New York City through Westchester to Connecticut.
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  That's right. They move. They've already destroyed Austin, so now they're moving on from here.
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  So let me ask you this. Elon Musk, I balance it.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  I don't like some of the AI stuff, but he's saying, have a bunch of kids.
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:26.000]  We need a pro-human future. Watch out. Don't take that shot.
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  We don't need censorship. We'll see if you can actually carry that out.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.000]  He's in an uphill battle, battling just to not have the company go under right now.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  Just in two minutes, what's your quick take on Elon Musk?
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  Fantastic. Love him. Great guy.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  Twitter is, for better or for worse, has taken over the American conversation,
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:46.000]  and it is complete trash.
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  I read it every day, and I'm just glad to collect it.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  So let's give him a chance and see what he can do.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  So he's trying to clean out the Aegean stables here.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  This is the thing about the left. They're unified to a fault.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  They'll take in any loony, trainee, pedophile. They've got their back.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000]  They've got Biden's back. They've got Federman's back.
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  We have the opposite problem. If someone has one imperfection,
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  if Trump is too braggadocious, if Elon Musk talked to the ADL,
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  if Ben Shapiro doesn't support Nick Fuentes, we shut everyone down,
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  and we're all divided. That's not me. I'm a hippie, man.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  If you want less government and free speech, then I'm with you.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:32.000]  We've got to unify these anti-government groups, because the left is winning.
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  Powerful. 60 seconds left.
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  Sensord.tv. Gavin, closing comment.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  We need to wake up, please. We've got to get back to our ideals.
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  20 years ago, we were all basically on the same page.
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  We wanted less government. We all believed in strong borders.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  Bill Clinton, Obama said we need strong borders.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  We all knew gay marriage was a farce.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.000]  Hillary Clinton was talking about how marriage is between a man and a woman.
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  With abortion, we all used to be on the same page.
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  Let's just try to get it down to viability outside the womb,
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:04.000]  27 weeks or whatever it is. The argument was there.
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  And then, and I blame Obama for this, everything shattered.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  And now we're back to talking about race like it's 1940.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  The borders are open, killing babies. We've just become unhinged.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  And we need, we need to get back together and narrow our differences.
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  Because when you, if you were like, get really drunk with, with a liberal,
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.000]  I bet you you would agree on most things.
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  I don't know how we got here, but now I'm looking at a golden, a green dress.
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.000]  And you're like the same dress telling me that it's white and black.
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:38.000]  It's insane. They have definitely broken reality.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  A mass psychosis.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  Gavin McGonigas, thank you so much.
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  Cheers, buddy.
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  Got other big guests coming up. I'll tell you who they are when they join us,
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  but I'm going to just throw this out.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:51.000]  We've got great products you already need, and we need to sustain on air.
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:54.000]  These things are the best supplements out there.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  You can go to infoworkstore.com.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  The biggest sell that you're going right now with promo code 1776 up to 60% off with that code.
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  But let me tell you what's selling out.
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  Because a bunch of this stuff won't be back until next year.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  It takes months and months to get this stuff back in stock.
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  Vitamin D3 gummies, highest quality with calcium for your immune system.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:14.000]  50% off with the promo code selling out.

[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  It makes them last longer. Same thing.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  Different way to do it.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  That is limited supply.
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  Massively discounted with promo code 1776, 50%.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  Knockout sleep support, out the power, vaso beats, X3 all selling out,
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  but still massively discounted. The sale's got to end.
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:58:09.000]  I mean, we'll keep the sale going, but a bunch of stuff's not going to be on the list in a couple days.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:13.000]  VitaMemeralfusion.
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.000]  Incredible.
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:15.000]  Vacant stock.
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  Massively discounted infowarstore.com.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:19.000]  The Vitamin C Zinc.

[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000]  1100%, with the Rose-Hips and Zinc.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000]  This is the Linus Polin formula.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000]  You want it infowarstore.com.
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000]  And the list goes on and on.
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:33.000]  DNA Force Plus, Rain Force Ultra, Supermal Vitality, Physic Magnesium.
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:41.180]  Physiomagnetism, all of it, from 40 to 60% off when you use promo code 1776 at infowarstore.com.
[01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:42.180]  You're insane.
[01:58:42.180 --> 01:58:43.180]  All the stuff going on in this world.
[01:58:43.180 --> 01:58:47.820]  If you don't boost your immune system, plus it keeps us on air, I win-win.
[01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:53.140]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:54.460]  you.
[01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:58.140]  And the globalist's number one mission is to silence info wars because they rightly
[01:58:58.140 --> 01:59:03.460]  see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America, but
[01:59:03.460 --> 01:59:08.260]  the world, to the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:13.700]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links from info wars.com
[01:59:13.700 --> 01:59:18.060]  and to also financially support info wars.com at the most critical time on our fight by

[01:59:30.220 --> 01:59:34.220]  I am in your hands and I'm asking of your support now, you have my commitment to never
[01:59:34.220 --> 01:59:37.580]  give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.

[01:59:49.900 --> 02:00:08.020]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.020 --> 02:00:10.020]  Evening Adam, welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight.
[02:00:10.020 --> 02:00:15.780]  A lot more than half of the entire population of the entire state of Arizona lives in Maricopa
[02:00:15.780 --> 02:00:16.780]  County.
[02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:21.480]  The cities of Mesa, Tempe, Scottsdale and largest of all Phoenix are all within the
[02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:23.220]  county's borders.
[02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:27.420]  If you want to win statewide in Arizona, you have to win Maricopa County.
[02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:31.900]  Unfortunately, as of tonight, we still don't know who has won Maricopa County, either in
[02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:36.140]  the U.S. Senate race there or in the governors in Arizona, because officials are not even
[02:00:36.140 --> 02:00:38.540]  close to the count.
[02:00:38.540 --> 02:00:45.820]  48 hours after the voting stop, there are still 633,000 ballots still uncounted in Arizona.
[02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:51.060]  More than 400,000 of those are in Maricopa County.
[02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:53.500]  When will we know the results?
[02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:56.820]  Last night, election officials claimed they'd have a new tally for us by 8 p.m. Eastern,
[02:00:56.820 --> 02:00:58.380]  the beginning of our show.
[02:00:58.380 --> 02:01:00.100]  But the deadline came and went.
[02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:04.660]  By the end of the night, they had finished counting fewer than 70,000 more votes.
[02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:07.740]  Then they said they'd have final totals by Friday, tomorrow.
[02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:08.740]  But no.
[02:01:08.740 --> 02:01:13.340]  Today, the county officials said they don't expect to announce the results of the elections
[02:01:13.340 --> 02:01:16.140]  until next week at the earliest.
[02:01:16.140 --> 02:01:22.620]  When do you anticipate the votes will be counted in total, those 400,000-plus votes?
[02:01:22.620 --> 02:01:25.980]  Well, we will be going into next week.
[02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:29.820]  There's some ones, the 2Zs, again, pursuant to Arizona law.
[02:01:29.820 --> 02:01:35.180]  But I think that we'll see the lion's share here wrap up by early next week.
[02:01:35.180 --> 02:01:36.820]  Early next week, can you give me a day?
[02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:39.140]  We're talking Monday, or we...
[02:01:39.140 --> 02:01:44.020]  Maybe, as long as you won't hold me to it.
[02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:48.420]  Can you tell us, Mr. Official, Mr. Election Official, when we might learn who won the
[02:01:48.420 --> 02:01:49.420]  election?
[02:01:49.420 --> 02:01:52.820]  Maybe, as long as you don't hold me to it.
[02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:56.220]  That was the chairman of the Maricopa County Supervisors.
[02:01:56.220 --> 02:01:57.980]  Notice what you did not hear in that exchange.
[02:01:57.980 --> 02:02:00.100]  You did not hear an apology.
[02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:04.660]  The guy in charge of election results never said sorry for not providing those results.
[02:02:04.660 --> 02:02:06.340]  It's hard to understand this.
[02:02:06.340 --> 02:02:08.740]  It's not a resource problem, certainly.
[02:02:08.740 --> 02:02:13.680]  The budget of Maricopa County is about $4.5 billion a year.
[02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:19.820]  For perspective, the entire Hoover Dam cost $890 million to build, and yes, that is in
[02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:21.580]  adjusted dollars.
[02:02:21.580 --> 02:02:27.740]  So for the price of five Hoover Dams, Maricopa County can't even count the ballots in a single
[02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:30.700]  statewide election in a country that claims to care about democracy.
[02:02:30.700 --> 02:02:34.460]  They can't even manage to let people vote on election day.
[02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:40.540]  On election day, according to the county, 70 of 223 polling places suffered major problems
[02:02:40.540 --> 02:02:42.620]  with voting machines.
[02:02:42.620 --> 02:02:47.260]  Machines the county paid millions for just recently, and their failure disenfranchised
[02:02:47.260 --> 02:02:51.100]  mostly Republican voters who wanted to cast their ballots in person.
[02:02:51.100 --> 02:02:54.860]  One poll worker reported that 25% of ballots were being rejected.
[02:02:54.860 --> 02:02:59.820]  Now, you would call that third world, but actually it's beneath third world.
[02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:02.420]  Most third world countries have serious elections.
[02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:04.140]  They require voter ID.
[02:03:04.140 --> 02:03:07.220]  They don't wait days for election results in Ghana.
[02:03:07.220 --> 02:03:11.220]  In Venezuela, whatever you think of it, they tally their ballots within hours.
[02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:14.660]  But suddenly we can't manage to do that?
[02:03:14.660 --> 02:03:17.820]  Clark County, Nevada, the home of Las Vegas says there are still tens of thousands of
[02:03:17.820 --> 02:03:18.820]  ballots left to count.
[02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:22.940]  Therefore, we're not going to know what happened in the election until Monday.
[02:03:22.940 --> 02:03:23.940]  We hope.
[02:03:23.940 --> 02:03:25.940]  We're going to talk to Adam Laxalt about that in a minute.
[02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:28.060]  He's running for Senate there.
[02:03:28.060 --> 02:03:29.820]  Officials in Clark County are clearly overwhelmed.
[02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:33.420]  They're too busy to finish the one job they are paid to do.
[02:03:33.420 --> 02:03:36.500]  And yet, strangely, they still have time to attack Donald Trump on social media, which
[02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:39.940]  they've been doing all day, first things first.
[02:03:39.940 --> 02:03:41.900]  But it's not just Nevada and Arizona.
[02:03:41.900 --> 02:03:46.660]  Key house races all along the west coast of the country, in California, Oregon and Washington
[02:03:46.660 --> 02:03:48.860]  state, are still unsettled tonight.
[02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:52.540]  They're saying they haven't counted the votes, really.
[02:03:52.540 --> 02:03:53.540]  What is this?
[02:03:53.540 --> 02:03:54.540]  Is this fraud?
[02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:56.380]  We're not sure.
[02:03:56.380 --> 02:03:58.820]  And on some level, it doesn't matter what it is.
[02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:02.740]  What we know is that the mechanics of our elections are not working, almost exclusively
[02:04:02.740 --> 02:04:05.980]  in states and cities run by Democrats.
[02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:07.260]  Are they cheating?
[02:04:07.260 --> 02:04:08.260]  Are they disorganized?
[02:04:08.260 --> 02:04:10.580]  Again, not relevant.
[02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:13.340]  The system is obviously out of control.
[02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:14.500]  It's flaky.
[02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:18.740]  And systems like that cannot be, by definition, reliable.
[02:04:18.740 --> 02:04:22.020]  Would you let America Coppa County elections official fly your aircraft?
[02:04:22.020 --> 02:04:23.740]  Probably not.
[02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:25.300]  That's a disaster.
[02:04:25.300 --> 02:04:26.860]  Democracy is a faith-based system.
[02:04:26.860 --> 02:04:30.500]  You have to believe in it in order for it to work.
[02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:33.420]  And who could believe in this?
[02:04:33.420 --> 02:04:36.740]  So our news media, in case you haven't noticed, has went the last several years, quote, defending
[02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:38.620]  democracy and sort of trademark here.
[02:04:38.620 --> 02:04:39.620]  All right.
[02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:40.620]  So you'd think that democracy defenders would care.
[02:04:40.620 --> 02:04:44.220]  The full 16-minute videos on inforwars.com, but Tucker Carlson is literally knocking
[02:04:44.220 --> 02:04:45.220]  it out of the park.
[02:04:45.220 --> 02:04:48.180]  I've got some other big breaking news on the side of this break.
[02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:51.300]  And then we have a special guest, Kent Heckenlively, in studio.
[02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:57.700]  You're going to really like this guy, stay with us.
[02:04:57.700 --> 02:05:03.180]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness
[02:05:03.180 --> 02:05:10.060]  Company, an alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where
[02:05:10.060 --> 02:05:15.620]  trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[02:05:15.620 --> 02:05:24.700]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide, providing uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[02:05:24.700 --> 02:05:33.020]  laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions, treatment packages specifically for COVID,
[02:05:33.020 --> 02:05:38.660]  post-COVID, vaccine injury syndromes, and all the usual things that are seen in primary
[02:05:38.660 --> 02:05:40.460]  care.
[02:05:40.460 --> 02:05:47.460]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media, and health
[02:05:47.460 --> 02:05:48.700]  advice.
[02:05:48.700 --> 02:05:56.180]  Come see the Wellness Company and go to OnlineHealthNow.com as a conduit to the Wellness
[02:05:56.180 --> 02:06:22.460]  Company.
[02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:29.580]  We are drugged out, we are following other people's opinions, we are controlled by the
[02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:32.660]  media, today it all changes.
[02:06:32.660 --> 02:06:37.700]  This reality has been forced upon us, it is a choice, just like when I said slavery is
[02:06:37.700 --> 02:06:38.700]  a choice.
[02:06:38.700 --> 02:06:43.180]  Einstein says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing as expecting a different result.
[02:06:43.180 --> 02:06:46.900]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f**k you, f**k you, how are we going to get
[02:06:46.900 --> 02:06:47.900]  a different result out of hate?
[02:06:47.900 --> 02:06:48.900]  Why don't we just try love?
[02:06:48.900 --> 02:06:52.740]  Why don't we just try love?
[02:06:52.740 --> 02:06:56.700]  We have the resources for a peaceful world.
[02:06:56.700 --> 02:07:00.900]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy mother f**kers to change something.
[02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:04.980]  Steve Jobs is crazy, now we all know Steve Jobs' phones, they say Trump's crazy, they
[02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:08.500]  say I'm crazy, but I'm here to show love.
[02:07:08.500 --> 02:07:14.220]  It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[02:07:14.220 --> 02:07:17.820]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:25.940]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:07:25.940 --> 02:07:28.900]  This is Uncle Sam with Music and the Truth Until Dawn.
[02:07:28.900 --> 02:07:32.860]  Right now I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:36.900]  The chair is against the wall, John has a long mustache.
[02:07:36.900 --> 02:07:38.900]  This is the heart of 1776.
[02:07:38.900 --> 02:07:44.580]  It's 12 o'clock American, another day closer to victory, and for all of you out there on
[02:07:44.580 --> 02:08:01.500]  the floor behind the lines, this is your song.
[02:08:01.500 --> 02:08:06.700]  When you see all this insanity around you, it's meant to just get you to turn off and
[02:08:06.700 --> 02:08:11.140]  just give up and roll over, and then things only get worse from that point out.
[02:08:11.140 --> 02:08:22.260]  A month or so ago, the horrific footage of a shop teacher wearing giant fake breasts
[02:08:22.260 --> 02:08:29.100]  and engaged in bizarre behavior in Ontario with the students, while the school board
[02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:33.380]  rules to allow male teacher to wear a giant prosthetic breast to school.
[02:08:33.380 --> 02:08:37.380]  It's meant to make the whole system a joke and collapse.
[02:08:37.380 --> 02:08:40.060]  Here's another one, I'll play a clip of this in a moment.
[02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:45.860]  Another biological male who weighs like 400 pounds, wins local Miss America beauty pageant.
[02:08:45.860 --> 02:08:50.980]  It's about desecrating the beauty of the goddess and us setting women on pedestals for how
[02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:53.900]  smart they are and how well-spoken they are and how physically beautiful they are.
[02:08:53.900 --> 02:08:59.020]  Oh, you're not allowed to have that because they're taking all of that away, all the different
[02:08:59.020 --> 02:09:04.380]  territories, all the different classical roles that humans are designed to fill.
[02:09:04.380 --> 02:09:09.260]  Meanwhile, we have Germans are trying to dance the cold away amid Europe's energy crisis
[02:09:09.260 --> 02:09:14.940]  as part of an initiative called Let's Move, which translates to warm up by dancing, and
[02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:19.180]  France is doing the same thing.
[02:09:19.180 --> 02:09:21.100]  Can they get you to wear a bubble when you go out?
[02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:24.660]  Can they get you to wear a mask when you swim?
[02:09:24.660 --> 02:09:28.020]  Can they get you to take a poison shot that doesn't protect you and erase your immunity?
[02:09:28.020 --> 02:09:33.460]  It's all in exercise, how stupid you'll act, believing if you just follow the carrot, you're
[02:09:33.460 --> 02:09:35.660]  going to get ahead.
[02:09:35.660 --> 02:09:46.500]  There's a clip of the transgender job of the Hutt that just won the beauty pageant.
[02:09:46.500 --> 02:10:03.100]  Can we skip to the good part?
[02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:07.700]  Nothing against fat people, I'm a little overweight too, but it's a fat dude with a wig on, with
[02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:12.340]  all these gorgeous women around him and saying, we don't recognize you, we're rigged judges,
[02:10:12.340 --> 02:10:16.300]  we're going to decide this is a woman.
[02:10:16.300 --> 02:10:18.380]  All they do is make jokes out of the organizations.
[02:10:18.380 --> 02:10:21.820]  It's like the new Lord of the Rings thing that cost a billion dollars failing, and it's
[02:10:21.820 --> 02:10:25.900]  like Jennifer Aniston came out and said, no one likes Hollywood anymore, there's no superstars
[02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:32.220]  anymore, everybody hates us, yes, it's over, and now you're just publicly being the poison
[02:10:32.220 --> 02:10:37.820]  you've always been trying to bring us down.
[02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:38.820]  Absolutely disgusting.
[02:10:38.820 --> 02:10:44.060]  Let's play a few clips here, I've got two of them, one in Germany, one in France of
[02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:48.580]  the new initiative where they're going to try to pipe heat out of nightclubs into apartment
[02:10:48.580 --> 02:10:52.340]  buildings saying you don't get carbon, but we can use human heat to power it.
[02:10:52.340 --> 02:10:56.900]  Again, training you, it's trendy and cool to eat bugs and have nothing and own nothing,
[02:10:56.900 --> 02:11:01.140]  here it is.
[02:11:01.140 --> 02:11:08.140]  The Germans are trying to dance the cold away, while World War III starts in the doorstep,
[02:11:08.140 --> 02:11:12.740]  a man Europe's energy crisis.
[02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:25.220]  It's part of an initiative called Let's Move, which translates to warm up by dancing.
[02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:32.220]  They meet at this concert house every week to brave incredible cold temperatures together.
[02:11:32.220 --> 02:11:46.980]  Look at these useful idiots, we're going to get rid of the carbon, it's good, we are
[02:11:46.980 --> 02:11:55.860]  submitting to whatever we're told, I'm good and trendy, baby, go to bed with me tonight.
[02:11:55.860 --> 02:11:58.580]  Yes, we dance to say warm.
[02:11:58.580 --> 02:12:02.220]  That's professional self-guided, this was through the steps of being idiot, Stockholm
[02:12:02.220 --> 02:12:03.220]  syndrome victims.
[02:12:03.220 --> 02:12:10.260]  Ah yes, we get no power now, so live now, good for you.
[02:12:10.260 --> 02:12:14.260]  Like in North Korea, you get no power.
[02:12:14.260 --> 02:12:19.540]  This is a good idea, it's positive for the crisis, we love them cutting our power off,
[02:12:19.540 --> 02:12:20.540]  it's so fine.
[02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:28.740]  Do what you're saying, he saved us, the classes proved popular, the program will expand throughout
[02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:35.180]  the winter, and the government won't give you power, there are warming stations.
[02:12:35.180 --> 02:12:43.460]  Here's France, harvesting the body heat, the nightclub where dancing creates green energy,
[02:12:43.460 --> 02:12:49.460]  the nightclub and music venue in Scotland, it's also in France.
[02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:56.780]  So it's all you will eat the bugs, you will love it, you will love it, all getting you
[02:12:56.780 --> 02:13:01.740]  to act like complete idiots and complete morons, like the band practices all over the world
[02:13:01.740 --> 02:13:04.980]  with people in bubbles, all over the line.
[02:13:04.980 --> 02:13:10.980]  Our audience is generating heat, which rises and it goes a long way in a room like this
[02:13:10.980 --> 02:13:15.940]  and is then captured in these cassettes above us and literally piped back through a plant
[02:13:15.940 --> 02:13:20.460]  room into boreholes in the ground which are out in our community garden.
[02:13:20.460 --> 02:13:26.100]  But none of this is new, in ancient Europe, everybody kept on the first story of their
[02:13:26.100 --> 02:13:33.100]  house, cows and pigs and horses, who would heat your house.
[02:13:33.100 --> 02:13:36.100]  It gets transported out to here, which is the community garden.
[02:13:36.100 --> 02:13:46.580]  But now you're the animals in the subterranean basement and of course that's enough.
[02:13:46.580 --> 02:13:50.340]  None of this is meant to actually ever give you a solution, it's been like oh we're taking
[02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:53.500]  your power away, we're taking your car away, we're taking your future away, we're taking
[02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:57.100]  your food away, but you can go dance in the nightclub and be trendy even though there
[02:13:57.100 --> 02:13:58.980]  won't be one of those in your area.
[02:13:58.980 --> 02:14:03.260]  It's supposed to get young people to feel like they're part of the new idiocy because
[02:14:03.260 --> 02:14:07.140]  they've been so caught off from the land, so caught off from the real world.
[02:14:07.140 --> 02:14:13.220]  New York man dies while being treated for experimental gene therapy using mRNA, CRISPR.
[02:14:13.220 --> 02:14:17.180]  He's only one person in the test and it killed him.
[02:14:17.180 --> 02:14:21.460]  The sole volunteer in a trial to test experimental and controversial gene editing therapy has
[02:14:21.460 --> 02:14:24.900]  died and it goes on from there.
[02:14:24.900 --> 02:14:29.340]  It's all the other different big tests, but this is well, but now they do it in mass,
[02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:35.300]  causing record numbers of death, but again it's a minor footnote, the news, meanwhile
[02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:37.620]  we're not permitted to make the connection.
[02:14:37.620 --> 02:14:41.860]  Social worker shares aftermath of COVID vaccine injury.
[02:14:41.860 --> 02:14:45.420]  She gets sick, her clients get sick, but you're not allowed to talk about it, and then there's
[02:14:45.420 --> 02:14:52.780]  so to my or, it's okay because she's not white, so she's good, we can trust her.
[02:14:52.780 --> 02:14:56.860]  The state court said no you can't force injections on New York workers to go to school or be cops
[02:14:56.860 --> 02:14:59.780]  or firemen or sanitary workers.
[02:14:59.780 --> 02:15:02.980]  She doesn't have a ticket, she's given an exemption, but she says you must take the
[02:15:02.980 --> 02:15:03.980]  shot.
[02:15:03.980 --> 02:15:08.860]  How liberal, how loving.
[02:15:08.860 --> 02:15:13.140]  Supreme court said to me you're denied, New York city's workers bid, the whole Vax mandate
[02:15:13.140 --> 02:15:16.980]  will the full Supreme Court take it, but the good news is we're investigating them with
[02:15:16.980 --> 02:15:22.540]  Senator Rand Paul being elected by a landslide, thousands of subpoena every last document about
[02:15:22.540 --> 02:15:27.100]  her fouching and his gain of function, but remember this, remember the 2012 Olympics
[02:15:27.100 --> 02:15:30.780]  with the big grim reaper coming out of the sky and the COVID virus killing all the children,
[02:15:30.780 --> 02:15:37.740]  everybody wearing masks, they love to throw at your face and get you all ready for it.
[02:15:37.740 --> 02:15:42.780]  Striking correlation between the auto vaccine boosters and excess deaths in England as the
[02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:48.380]  total of excess deaths explodes the old time historical records, so roll off them sleeves,
[02:15:48.380 --> 02:15:52.660]  take those shots, get those blood clots and get ready to have massive heart attacks and
[02:15:52.660 --> 02:15:57.100]  strokes and clear off the planet for the globalists.
[02:15:57.100 --> 02:16:03.260]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[02:16:03.260 --> 02:16:08.940]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[02:16:08.940 --> 02:16:12.540]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[02:16:12.540 --> 02:16:16.940]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's came over and
[02:16:16.940 --> 02:16:22.980]  all over the planet humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back and our main
[02:16:22.980 --> 02:16:27.300]  tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:32.540]  That's why when you share articles and videos from man.video or infowars.com or newswars.com
[02:16:32.540 --> 02:16:37.300]  it changes the world and that's why when you go to infowarsstore.com and get amazing products
[02:16:37.300 --> 02:16:42.620]  that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also
[02:16:42.620 --> 02:16:47.100]  empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist, the fight starts at
[02:16:47.100 --> 02:16:52.740]  infowars.com and the support of the fight starts at infowarsstore.com, God bless and
[02:16:52.740 --> 02:16:57.300]  thank you all for your support.
[02:16:57.300 --> 02:17:02.660]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any republican
[02:17:02.660 --> 02:17:07.620]  victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine
[02:17:07.620 --> 02:17:13.260]  possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and
[02:17:13.260 --> 02:17:18.860]  the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible, that made
[02:17:18.860 --> 02:17:24.140]  any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support infowars, despite the
[02:17:24.140 --> 02:17:30.260]  massive lawfare being waged against infowars, despite the media defamatory libelist campaign
[02:17:30.260 --> 02:17:35.380]  against infowars, the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make
[02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:40.620]  their own lives healthier, wealthier and wiser is what keeps infowars on the air and what
[02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:46.940]  that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[02:17:46.940 --> 02:17:53.020]  So continue to do it, go to places like infowarsstore.com, go to places like save infowars, continue
[02:17:53.020 --> 02:17:58.260]  to keep infowars alive because in the process you're keeping American liberty alive.
[02:17:58.260 --> 02:18:04.180]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[02:18:04.180 --> 02:18:09.540]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit.
[02:18:09.540 --> 02:18:13.020]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your
[02:18:13.020 --> 02:18:14.420]  ability to speak freely.
[02:18:14.420 --> 02:18:17.620]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or
[02:18:17.620 --> 02:18:19.060]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[02:18:19.060 --> 02:18:23.220]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[02:18:23.220 --> 02:18:27.540]  all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[02:18:27.540 --> 02:18:28.540]  your support.
[02:18:28.540 --> 02:18:31.620]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[02:18:31.620 --> 02:18:36.140]  as to America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[02:18:36.140 --> 02:18:39.780]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful info wars has been
[02:18:39.780 --> 02:18:41.460]  because of your past support.
[02:18:41.460 --> 02:18:45.300]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now, to critical juncture of the battle,
[02:18:45.300 --> 02:18:49.700]  free double your efforts by visiting infowarsstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us
[02:18:49.700 --> 02:18:50.700]  on air.

[02:18:56.140 --> 02:18:58.420]  your support.
[02:18:58.420 --> 02:18:59.420]  It's our best seller.
[02:18:59.420 --> 02:19:04.500]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller, but as folks
[02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:09.140]  tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy
[02:19:09.140 --> 02:19:13.620]  it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller, and it's been sold out
[02:19:13.620 --> 02:19:15.940]  for a while, but it's finally back at stock.
[02:19:15.940 --> 02:19:21.380]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular
[02:19:21.380 --> 02:19:22.380]  function of the body.
[02:19:22.380 --> 02:19:27.180]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you
[02:19:27.180 --> 02:19:32.420]  need to live and be healthy, essential means without these things you die, and so much
[02:19:32.420 --> 02:19:37.500]  of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster
[02:19:37.500 --> 02:19:39.900]  our body's defenses with a product like this.
[02:19:39.900 --> 02:19:43.540]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the
[02:19:43.540 --> 02:19:48.060]  very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the info war, so the only way you lose is
[02:19:48.060 --> 02:19:53.460]  not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally back at stock at infowarsstore.com
[02:19:53.460 --> 02:19:54.980]  for a 50% off.
[02:19:54.980 --> 02:19:58.860]  Vitamin mineral fusion back at stock at infowarsstore.com.
[02:19:58.860 --> 02:20:04.980]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:04.980 --> 02:20:15.940]  There are of course those who do not want us to speak, just let me think, even now orders
[02:20:15.940 --> 02:20:20.260]  are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[02:20:20.260 --> 02:20:21.260]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[02:20:21.260 --> 02:20:22.260]  Damn it.
[02:20:22.260 --> 02:20:23.260]  Why?
[02:20:23.260 --> 02:20:28.580]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain
[02:20:28.580 --> 02:20:29.580]  their power.
[02:20:29.580 --> 02:20:34.580]  Words are for the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation for
[02:20:34.580 --> 02:20:35.580]  truth.
[02:20:35.580 --> 02:20:40.540]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[02:20:40.540 --> 02:20:44.260]  You decided sir, you wanted it foolproof, you told me every television end longer.
[02:20:44.260 --> 02:20:49.580]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and depression, and where once you have the freedom to object
[02:20:49.580 --> 02:20:54.780]  and to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have sensors and systems of surveillance,
[02:20:54.780 --> 02:20:57.780]  perversing your conformity and selecting your submachine.
[02:20:57.780 --> 02:20:58.780]  We need cameras.
[02:20:58.780 --> 02:20:59.780]  How did this happen?
[02:20:59.780 --> 02:21:00.780]  Who's to blame?
[02:21:00.780 --> 02:21:05.980]  Well certainly there are those who are more responsible than others, they will be held
[02:21:05.980 --> 02:21:11.580]  accountable, but again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look
[02:21:11.580 --> 02:21:12.580]  into a mirror.
[02:21:12.580 --> 02:21:18.580]  I know why you did it, I know you were afraid, who wouldn't be?
[02:21:18.580 --> 02:21:24.980]  War, terror, disease, there were a myriad of problems to conspire to corrupt your reason
[02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:26.980]  and rob you of your common sense.
[02:21:26.980 --> 02:21:32.620]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam
[02:21:32.620 --> 02:21:33.620]  Sutler.
[02:21:33.620 --> 02:21:38.780]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent
[02:21:38.780 --> 02:22:02.780]  obedient consent.
[02:22:08.780 --> 02:22:14.580]  Well, Ken Heckin-Lively is our guest in studio for the balance of the hour to talk about
[02:22:14.580 --> 02:22:21.180]  his book, bestseller presidential takedown, and also talk about the midterms, what we're
[02:22:21.180 --> 02:22:24.900]  witnessing as an attorney science teacher and two-time New York Times bestseller, he's
[02:22:24.900 --> 02:22:30.140]  best known as co-author of the Plague series, Plague Plague, Corruption and Ending Plague
[02:22:30.140 --> 02:22:34.740]  with Dr. Judy Mikovits, and it just goes on from there.
[02:22:34.740 --> 02:22:39.100]  We really appreciate him coming on with us today, and he didn't want to talk about this,
[02:22:39.100 --> 02:22:41.340]  but we're going to talk about it, because I told everybody, I didn't just put this
[02:22:41.340 --> 02:22:44.660]  book together myself, I sent him a ton of material, we worked on it a lot, we had to
[02:22:44.660 --> 02:22:47.940]  cut it down a lot, we're probably going to write more books on it, but he really helped
[02:22:47.940 --> 02:22:51.980]  me write the Great Reset and the War for the World, which has been offered on the number
[02:22:51.980 --> 02:22:55.820]  one bestseller, it's been the bestseller of the New York Times, ignored that, you can
[02:22:55.820 --> 02:22:58.180]  find the book at infowarstore.com.
[02:22:58.180 --> 02:23:01.860]  So Ken, congratulations, it's good to meet you in person, I look forward to having you
[02:23:01.860 --> 02:23:06.820]  on many times in the future, been following your work for several years, and it's a very,
[02:23:06.820 --> 02:23:12.940]  very, very small world that we're here together with all the work we both do.
[02:23:12.940 --> 02:23:14.620]  What do you want to hit on first?
[02:23:14.620 --> 02:23:19.180]  So the first thing I'd like to hit on is my new book, Presidential Takedown, which I
[02:23:19.180 --> 02:23:26.020]  co-wrote with Dr. Paul Alexander, who was the Senior Pandemic Advisor, and it really
[02:23:26.020 --> 02:23:29.140]  is a You Are Their Book.
[02:23:29.140 --> 02:23:37.540]  So every one of us sat and watched on our couches those COVID-19 Task Force meetings,
[02:23:37.540 --> 02:23:42.220]  and we listened to what Fauci said, we listened to what Deborah Burke said, we listened to
[02:23:42.220 --> 02:23:49.220]  President Trump, and what this book does is it pulls you through the television, and you
[02:23:49.220 --> 02:23:54.380]  go behind the scenes to find out what was really going on, you get to be a fly on the
[02:23:54.380 --> 02:23:55.380]  wall.
[02:23:55.380 --> 02:23:57.460]  And I could see it in the far they were setting him up, but I'm not trying to just defend
[02:23:57.460 --> 02:24:01.220]  Trump, it's true, because they had pre-bragged years before how they were going to use a
[02:24:01.220 --> 02:24:05.460]  crisis to blow up the old system, and then they set Trump up.
[02:24:05.460 --> 02:24:11.980]  Yeah, and so I think a lot of us, Alex, had that sense that when we watched those presentations,
[02:24:11.980 --> 02:24:16.500]  some of us were comforted by it, some of us were skeptical, and others just didn't know
[02:24:16.500 --> 02:24:17.700]  what to make of it.
[02:24:17.700 --> 02:24:19.700]  But you've documented how they set it up.
[02:24:19.700 --> 02:24:24.460]  Yeah, and so what was really great for me was to get Dr. Paul Alexander, who is one of
[02:24:24.460 --> 02:24:30.940]  the world's leading experts on evidence-based medicine, to hand me over all of the documentation
[02:24:30.940 --> 02:24:34.100]  about the emails and articles that he wrote.
[02:24:34.100 --> 02:24:36.460]  Just to be clear, he was there when this was happening.
[02:24:36.460 --> 02:24:37.460]  Yeah, so basically...
[02:24:37.460 --> 02:24:38.940]  He's a whistleblower, basically.
[02:24:38.940 --> 02:24:46.740]  Yeah, Dr. Alexander was there from approximately May of 2020 till September of 2020, when he
[02:24:46.740 --> 02:24:53.940]  underwent a terrible scandal, basically they ran him out of town.
[02:24:53.940 --> 02:24:54.940]  He discontinued.
[02:24:54.940 --> 02:24:55.940]  Yeah.
[02:24:55.940 --> 02:24:56.940]  The book's amazing.
[02:24:56.940 --> 02:24:57.940]  I know it's shooting up the charts.
[02:24:57.940 --> 02:25:05.380]  Yeah, so there's a lot to say about this book, and I'm not here to be on the side of
[02:25:05.380 --> 02:25:07.940]  Team Red or Team Blue.
[02:25:07.940 --> 02:25:14.820]  This is about team humanity, and we need to know what went on behind the COVID-19 task
[02:25:14.820 --> 02:25:15.820]  force.
[02:25:15.820 --> 02:25:22.020]  And like I said, in this book, you're a fly on the wall, because Dr. Alexander had so many
[02:25:22.020 --> 02:25:23.820]  amazing experiences.
[02:25:23.820 --> 02:25:31.380]  For example, he helped prepare Fauci on what they call the murder boards for Fauci's presentations
[02:25:31.380 --> 02:25:33.020]  before Congress.
[02:25:33.020 --> 02:25:39.340]  And if you thought that Fauci fought with Rand Paul and Senator Ron Johnson, well, he
[02:25:39.340 --> 02:25:45.180]  was fighting behind the scenes when Paul Alexander was really going after him hard, so that's
[02:25:45.180 --> 02:25:46.620]  all covered in the book.
[02:25:46.620 --> 02:25:52.380]  I think probably one of the most hopeful things of the book is that Dr. Alexander tells the
[02:25:52.380 --> 02:25:58.780]  story of how on his second day working for the COVID-19 task force, his boss told him
[02:25:58.780 --> 02:26:05.860]  to go to a restaurant on the National Mall and wait for some people to meet him.
[02:26:05.860 --> 02:26:08.460]  So three people approached him.
[02:26:08.460 --> 02:26:10.540]  They took off their masks.
[02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:13.260]  One was Republican Senator.
[02:26:13.260 --> 02:26:19.420]  The other was a Democratic Senator, and the third person was a Democratic Congressperson.
[02:26:19.420 --> 02:26:25.020]  And they told Paul that the reason he had actually been hired was to write a report
[02:26:25.020 --> 02:26:34.180]  on the CDC because a bipartisan group of politicians had realized that the CDC had become a political
[02:26:34.180 --> 02:26:35.340]  agency.
[02:26:35.340 --> 02:26:39.140]  They wanted to tear it down to the studs and rebuild it.
[02:26:39.140 --> 02:26:41.860]  And Paul was the one who would write that report.
[02:26:41.860 --> 02:26:43.460]  Now, by the time he got fined...
[02:26:43.460 --> 02:26:46.180]  So he was drafted in because he was already a whistleblower.
[02:26:46.180 --> 02:26:50.180]  Well he was drafted in because they believed that he was an honest...
[02:26:50.180 --> 02:26:51.180]  His integrity.
[02:26:51.180 --> 02:26:52.900]  They believed in his integrity.
[02:26:52.900 --> 02:26:56.540]  And now Senator Paul, if we hopefully get the Senate to try to have a big investigation,
[02:26:56.540 --> 02:26:58.940]  that's why this is so critical to blueprint what really happened.
[02:26:58.940 --> 02:27:03.380]  Yeah, and so here's what I would say that people should think about this book as.
[02:27:03.380 --> 02:27:09.340]  I think that they should look at this book as the blueprint for a Senate or congressional
[02:27:09.340 --> 02:27:13.540]  investigation into what went on with the COVID-19 task force.
[02:27:13.540 --> 02:27:18.580]  Now Paul was there for a significant period of time, but we never say that we know everything
[02:27:18.580 --> 02:27:19.580]  about it.
[02:27:19.580 --> 02:27:23.260]  But the story that he tells is really shocking.
[02:27:23.260 --> 02:27:27.860]  And I think probably one of the most amazing things about it is he talks about...
[02:27:27.860 --> 02:27:29.740]  And this is just culture.
[02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:31.420]  How do these people think?
[02:27:31.420 --> 02:27:34.980]  And I think that's really important to get across.
[02:27:34.980 --> 02:27:42.540]  And so as the senior pandemic advisor, he got to be at the executive lunchroom for health
[02:27:42.540 --> 02:27:45.900]  and human services with all these top officials.
[02:27:45.900 --> 02:27:51.180]  And when they were together privately, they would always use this expression, we in the
[02:27:51.180 --> 02:27:53.180]  bureaucracy think.
[02:27:53.180 --> 02:27:57.780]  And now that's kind of a terrifying idea to me because we think that it should be we
[02:27:57.780 --> 02:28:00.100]  the people, not we the bureaucracies.
[02:28:00.100 --> 02:28:01.420]  This is literally the deep state.
[02:28:01.420 --> 02:28:03.460]  Yeah, this is the administrative state.
[02:28:03.460 --> 02:28:09.300]  And it's important not to say that these are evil people, but just to say this is the way
[02:28:09.300 --> 02:28:10.300]  they think.
[02:28:10.300 --> 02:28:15.460]  Well, plus they get a corporate directive from Big Pharma and then they all parrot it.
[02:28:15.460 --> 02:28:16.460]  So they're not really thinking.
[02:28:16.460 --> 02:28:18.300]  They're saying this is what we've been told today.
[02:28:18.300 --> 02:28:25.420]  And so one of the things that Paul had was he was literally one floor below Operation
[02:28:25.420 --> 02:28:26.660]  Warp Speed.
[02:28:26.660 --> 02:28:33.380]  He basically had to walk a couple steps from his desk, take a stairway up.
[02:28:33.380 --> 02:28:34.380]  You know, of course, it was guard.
[02:28:34.380 --> 02:28:35.380]  Stay there.
[02:28:35.380 --> 02:28:37.660]  So this book could really be inside Operation Warp Speed.
[02:28:37.660 --> 02:28:38.660]  Yes.
[02:28:38.660 --> 02:28:39.660]  Wow.
[02:28:39.660 --> 02:28:40.660]  Yeah.
[02:28:40.660 --> 02:28:42.060]  I can't wait to read.
[02:28:42.060 --> 02:28:45.180]  I run around the synopsis and I it's it's amazing.
[02:28:45.180 --> 02:28:47.740]  We're going to talk about it because folks, the whole future is this.
[02:28:47.740 --> 02:28:50.220]  We don't know the past, you're doomed to repeat it.
[02:28:50.220 --> 02:28:52.060]  We are going to expose this deep state.
[02:28:52.060 --> 02:29:01.060]  You got to read the book.
[02:29:01.060 --> 02:29:05.420]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[02:29:05.420 --> 02:29:11.540]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and
[02:29:11.540 --> 02:29:17.060]  physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[02:29:17.060 --> 02:29:23.420]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is Info Wars because we know the globalist
[02:29:23.420 --> 02:29:24.420]  number.
[02:29:24.420 --> 02:29:25.540]  We know their operation.

[02:31:58.500 --> 02:32:03.340]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalist.
[02:32:03.340 --> 02:32:09.020]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the
[02:32:09.020 --> 02:32:10.020]  world.
[02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:15.380]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[02:32:15.380 --> 02:32:16.380]  deserve the credit.
[02:32:16.380 --> 02:32:21.340]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars for the real
[02:32:21.340 --> 02:32:26.980]  reason we've had this success, we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against
[02:32:26.980 --> 02:32:29.300]  the global order we've ever had.
[02:32:29.300 --> 02:32:35.700]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more
[02:32:35.700 --> 02:32:39.820]  important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue
[02:32:39.820 --> 02:32:42.860]  in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[02:32:42.860 --> 02:32:43.860]  God bless you all.
[02:32:43.860 --> 02:32:44.860]  I salute you.
[02:32:44.860 --> 02:32:45.860]  I thank you.
[02:32:45.860 --> 02:32:51.140]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history
[02:32:51.140 --> 02:32:52.140]  is happening.
[02:32:52.140 --> 02:32:53.700]  The fight is my fight.
[02:32:53.700 --> 02:32:54.700]  It's your fight.
[02:32:54.700 --> 02:32:55.700]  It's our fight.
[02:32:55.700 --> 02:32:58.580]  It's in your power.
[02:32:58.580 --> 02:33:06.580]  It's your battle.
[02:33:06.580 --> 02:33:15.320]  Leader of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:15.320 --> 02:33:24.480]  Well, the steps in the box from the InfoWars of científic.comrados.org you don't want
[02:33:24.480 --> 02:33:25.480]  Yeah.
[02:33:25.480 --> 02:33:28.840]  times or it's their first time and they're they're shocked by this they
[02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:31.060]  don't get the depopulation as you enter the New World Order that the
[02:33:31.060 --> 02:33:37.180]  globalist got to play God and their cosmology but it is so central not just
[02:33:37.180 --> 02:33:40.820]  for America the whole world to expose where this virus came from what the
[02:33:40.820 --> 02:33:45.460]  shots are doing how these central corporations and banks controlled all
[02:33:45.460 --> 02:33:50.020]  the major responses to it and how they controlled President Trump and then on
[02:33:50.020 --> 02:33:54.980]  after that point so Kent Hickenlively is here he is a best-selling two-time New
[02:33:54.980 --> 02:33:59.180]  York Times best-selling author he is here he's got the new book dealing with
[02:33:59.180 --> 02:34:04.180]  what really happened inside of the White House with a major insider whistleblower
[02:34:04.180 --> 02:34:08.300]  Dr. Alexander presidential tech down great name because that's what they've
[02:34:08.300 --> 02:34:12.620]  done with Trump they use us to shut down the economy have the mail-in ballots I
[02:34:12.620 --> 02:34:16.320]  mean it was all based on that and remember what Fauci said when Trump was
[02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:22.780]  first elected in 2017 he said Trump will be challenged by a major virus by a
[02:34:22.780 --> 02:34:27.660]  major new pandemic and he looked very very satisfied there it is just days
[02:34:27.660 --> 02:34:31.100]  before Trump inauguration Dr. Fauci claimed that the Trump administration
[02:34:31.100 --> 02:34:35.340]  will face a surprised outbreak we'll play that clip in a moment but can't
[02:34:35.340 --> 02:34:38.980]  please continue yeah so one of the things that I think is really important
[02:34:38.980 --> 02:34:45.580]  about this book is that Dr. Alexander was intimately familiar with the entire
[02:34:45.580 --> 02:34:54.420]  Operation Warp Speed program and what he detailed to me is that how there were
[02:34:54.420 --> 02:35:00.060]  government scientists there government bureaucrats but then and military
[02:35:00.060 --> 02:35:07.420]  people but then these this other group of people that he couldn't figure out who
[02:35:07.420 --> 02:35:11.580]  they were and the only answer he could come up with is that they were
[02:35:11.580 --> 02:35:17.740]  intelligence people and so when he was at Operation Warp Speed talking to all
[02:35:17.740 --> 02:35:21.540]  the doctors talking to the scientists talking to the bureaucrats because he
[02:35:21.540 --> 02:35:26.020]  was basically supposed to be the evidence-based medicine expert he he
[02:35:26.020 --> 02:35:32.780]  really saw that the line of authority was not civilians controlling the
[02:35:32.780 --> 02:35:39.620]  military controlling the intelligence communities it was big pharma controlling
[02:35:39.620 --> 02:35:43.620]  the government and the intelligence agencies and so and that's what Dr.
[02:35:43.620 --> 02:35:46.620]  Peter McCullis said Saturday for two hours wrote a big article on it's
[02:35:46.620 --> 02:35:50.660]  confirmed just last week a big document came out that before they even released
[02:35:50.660 --> 02:35:54.900]  covid they had a whole shadow government group ready to roll it out yeah and so
[02:35:54.900 --> 02:36:01.260]  you know like I say you know every person gets to see a piece of the truth so
[02:36:01.260 --> 02:36:07.740]  this book is about Dr. Alexander's piece of the truth now one of the really
[02:36:07.740 --> 02:36:14.180]  important things that I think people need to understand is how much power people
[02:36:14.180 --> 02:36:19.900]  like Francis Collins and Tony Fauci have over the scientific establishment and I
[02:36:19.900 --> 02:36:23.100]  think that this is something that's confused people because they don't really
[02:36:23.100 --> 02:36:28.020]  understand it yeah how does the mechanism work well let me tell you the
[02:36:28.020 --> 02:36:35.420]  simplest thing that you can do is you can Google how much money does the NIH give
[02:36:35.420 --> 02:36:43.780]  out every year in research grants okay it's 30 billion dollars okay so Tony
[02:36:43.780 --> 02:36:50.020]  Fauci and Francis Collins sat on top of that research pyramid because what they've
[02:36:50.020 --> 02:36:55.060]  done is they have really kind of changed science over the past 30 years so
[02:36:55.060 --> 02:36:59.500]  instead of you having groups of scientists trying to figure out what
[02:36:59.500 --> 02:37:03.140]  should be done where money should be spent and everything instead we've got
[02:37:03.140 --> 02:37:08.100]  these generals okay so Fauci and Collins should be looked at as the generals and
[02:37:08.100 --> 02:37:12.780]  unquestioned generals so 30 billion dollars a year they have to give out or
[02:37:12.780 --> 02:37:17.780]  generals in command fill Marshall's yeah and so so let's think about how much
[02:37:17.780 --> 02:37:22.420]  does it cost to elect a president of the United States well that answer from
[02:37:22.420 --> 02:37:30.900]  2020 is both sides spent five billion dollars okay so every single year Fauci
[02:37:30.900 --> 02:37:37.980]  and Collins six times had 30 billion dollars at their at their disposal and
[02:37:37.980 --> 02:37:42.580]  that's how they gain control of science so say that again that's so huge a whole
[02:37:42.580 --> 02:37:47.140]  presidential elections five billion this is 30 billion a year that is six times
[02:37:47.140 --> 02:37:53.220]  yeah so so basically five billion dollars to elect a president over six
[02:37:53.220 --> 02:37:59.020]  years 30 billion is a hundred and eighty billion so when you when oh you're
[02:37:59.020 --> 02:38:03.420]  right a president's every four it's not it's not 30 it's a hundred oh my I was
[02:38:03.420 --> 02:38:11.740]  doing my math wrong wow it's not six times four so so basically wow and
[02:38:11.740 --> 02:38:16.700]  Collins during the four years of the Trump administration were able to hand
[02:38:16.700 --> 02:38:21.180]  out a hundred and twenty billion dollars in walking around money you know
[02:38:21.180 --> 02:38:26.140]  science money is supposed to be for our benefit but well for inflation it's
[02:38:26.140 --> 02:38:29.580]  180 I heard hundred hundred eighty hundred and twenty that's still huge yeah
[02:38:29.580 --> 02:38:35.220]  yeah so they it's that's an immense amount of power especially when you
[02:38:35.220 --> 02:38:39.540]  consider it only costs five billion dollars to elect a president both sides
[02:38:39.540 --> 02:38:42.780]  spending that money and so they get all their yes man will look how they had
[02:38:42.780 --> 02:38:46.740]  three different FDA boards they had to let go till they finally got FDA boards
[02:38:46.740 --> 02:38:49.620]  but go after the kids with the shots so even with all that money they're still
[02:38:49.620 --> 02:38:52.580]  doing the right thing until they go through a process of getting their yes
[02:38:52.580 --> 02:38:58.580]  man yeah exactly and and so you know I think that the public and and this is
[02:38:58.580 --> 02:39:03.660]  something that I try to be really gentle and saying this but I think lots of us
[02:39:03.660 --> 02:39:09.980]  believe that what happens in science is that you know disinterested groups of
[02:39:09.980 --> 02:39:16.220]  experts get together go through the data figure out what the priorities are and
[02:39:16.220 --> 02:39:20.660]  then spend that money and that would be wonderful if science worked that way but
[02:39:20.660 --> 02:39:24.860]  it's not when you have these field marshals who are in charge of thirty
[02:39:24.860 --> 02:39:30.820]  billion dollars a year going out to science 120 per cycle just the way you
[02:39:30.820 --> 02:39:36.460]  put it's incredible yeah well I think you need to understand the structure of
[02:39:36.460 --> 02:39:41.180]  it because I completely believe because I've been studying Fauci for the past
[02:39:41.180 --> 02:39:46.580]  ten years because he was kind of the bane of dr. Judy Mike of its existence so
[02:39:46.580 --> 02:39:52.980]  I've been aware of how he has been a part of creating this system where you
[02:39:52.980 --> 02:39:58.500]  know people like him are in charge of more and more research money and and you
[02:39:58.500 --> 02:40:03.220]  know and disenfranchising regular science oh so let's go back to Eisenhower
[02:40:03.220 --> 02:40:06.540]  and guys I know I said get the clip and you found it a foul to a plate next
[02:40:06.540 --> 02:40:10.980]  segment but just get the clip where he says military industrial complex Eisenhower
[02:40:10.980 --> 02:40:14.700]  but the full 21-minute speech he says there is a technological elite with
[02:40:14.700 --> 02:40:18.340]  grant money by big corporations it's already got control of almost all
[02:40:18.340 --> 02:40:23.100]  science ideas and it's killing natural science and it's creating an authoritarian
[02:40:23.100 --> 02:40:26.780]  scientific dictatorship the full 21-minute farewell address is getting
[02:40:26.780 --> 02:40:31.260]  exactly what you just said about the military industrial complex yeah so you
[02:40:31.260 --> 02:40:35.340]  know if you want to if you want to characterize me I would consider myself
[02:40:35.340 --> 02:40:41.140]  an Eisenhower Republican let's just change the structure you know I will go
[02:40:41.140 --> 02:40:46.180]  after people who are corrupt as I believe Fauci is but I think it's important
[02:40:46.180 --> 02:40:50.820]  for people to understand that there is a corrupt system in place and and this
[02:40:50.820 --> 02:40:56.500]  corrupt system would do the same thing to a Democratic presidential reformer as
[02:40:56.500 --> 02:41:00.100]  it did to Trump and so I that's why what happened to liberals they used to be
[02:41:00.100 --> 02:41:04.140]  good on anti-war and good on controlling McFarman and controlling
[02:41:04.140 --> 02:41:09.820]  Monsanto now they love it all well you know I kind of consider myself a child
[02:41:09.820 --> 02:41:16.660]  of the late 1970s where you could be anti-big business you anti-big military
[02:41:16.660 --> 02:41:21.140]  anti-big intelligence anti-big government and it seemed like that those
[02:41:21.140 --> 02:41:26.060]  were liberal positions in the late 1970s and it's it's kind of strange to me how
[02:41:26.060 --> 02:41:31.340]  it's flipped and now suddenly I'm a right-winger where if you went back to
[02:41:31.340 --> 02:41:36.300]  the 1970s I would be kind of on the liberal side so if you define with real
[02:41:36.300 --> 02:41:40.860]  terms not some Machiavellian name or a William name what are modern liberals
[02:41:40.860 --> 02:41:47.980]  just conformist corporate bots consumers that just take orders you know I I wish
[02:41:47.980 --> 02:41:52.900]  I wish I understood it but you know I I think there's this great tension in the
[02:41:52.900 --> 02:41:57.780]  human soul between wanting to follow authorities and and and collaborate with
[02:41:57.780 --> 02:42:02.060]  other people and being an independent thinker and you know I always jokingly
[02:42:02.060 --> 02:42:07.540]  say I think 75% of the people would kind of do whatever those in charge wanted
[02:42:07.540 --> 02:42:13.220]  them to do and about 25% you know will really consider what said so so I think
[02:42:13.220 --> 02:42:21.460]  this is it's for lack of a better way of saying it I feel like the corporate
[02:42:21.460 --> 02:42:28.620]  powers have psychologically manipulated the left to believe something that 40
[02:42:28.620 --> 02:42:34.420]  years ago would have been completely anathema to the left perfectly said in
[02:42:34.420 --> 02:42:37.660]  fact this is a live show but take that little last minute put it up front we
[02:42:37.660 --> 02:42:41.460]  put the clip out because you're absolutely right again Kent you are
[02:42:41.460 --> 02:42:43.820]  knocking it out of the park right now we'll talk about some of the other books
[02:42:43.820 --> 02:42:48.940]  you've written as well and look at this election straight ahead info wars comm
[02:42:48.940 --> 02:42:59.020]  Kent heck and lively books.com stay with us Alex why is this taking so long why
[02:42:59.020 --> 02:43:02.700]  is this taking so long in France they can count all the paper ballots and they're
[02:43:02.700 --> 02:43:07.540]  done in a day why can't we do this here the answer is fraud and corruption if
[02:43:07.540 --> 02:43:11.500]  we don't fix the system it doesn't matter where the Republican nominees Donald
[02:43:11.500 --> 02:43:15.500]  Trump or governor to sanctimonious they're going to deny us Michigan they're
[02:43:15.500 --> 02:43:19.740]  going to deny us Pennsylvania they're going to deny us Arizona and I can't
[02:43:19.740 --> 02:43:25.380]  come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is
[02:43:25.380 --> 02:43:30.860]  an America first majority in every single one of them so we need to keep
[02:43:30.860 --> 02:43:35.860]  fighting for reform of the system Tucker Carlson said this better last night
[02:43:35.860 --> 02:43:39.580]  than anything else communications are the reason why we didn't well that's why
[02:43:39.580 --> 02:43:44.460]  info wars comm is so damn important that's why they're so desperate to take
[02:43:44.460 --> 02:43:49.420]  you off the air Alex people need to get behind info wars this alternative
[02:43:49.420 --> 02:43:54.780]  media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important we need more of
[02:43:54.780 --> 02:43:58.740]  this communications not less the tip of the spear throughout this entire
[02:43:58.740 --> 02:44:03.700]  process the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible the
[02:44:03.700 --> 02:44:08.220]  only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible the only thing
[02:44:08.220 --> 02:44:12.740]  that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the
[02:44:12.740 --> 02:44:16.420]  school shutdowns and and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs
[02:44:16.420 --> 02:44:21.460]  possible it made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to
[02:44:21.460 --> 02:44:26.300]  support info wars despite the massive lawfare being waged against info wars
[02:44:26.300 --> 02:44:31.020]  despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against info wars the
[02:44:31.020 --> 02:44:35.620]  ordinary people the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives
[02:44:35.620 --> 02:44:40.020]  healthier wealthier and wiser is what keeps info wars on the air and what
[02:44:40.020 --> 02:44:45.700]  that does is keep the populist message alive in an era in an age of totalitarian
[02:44:45.700 --> 02:44:49.980]  oppression so continue to do it go to places like info wars store dot com go
[02:44:49.980 --> 02:44:53.620]  to the places like save info wars continue to keep info wars alive
[02:44:53.620 --> 02:44:58.380]  because in the process you're keeping American liberty alive everybody says
[02:44:58.380 --> 02:45:02.260]  they want people to stand up and fight tyranny but when you fight tyranny the

[02:47:56.740 --> 02:48:01.940]  there will be a challenge the coming administration in the arena of infectious
[02:48:01.940 --> 02:48:05.540]  diseases both chronic infectious diseases in the sense of already
[02:48:05.540 --> 02:48:10.300]  ongoing disease and we have certainly a large burden of that but also there will
[02:48:10.300 --> 02:48:23.060]  be a surprise outbreak there will be a surprise outbreak there will be a surprise
[02:48:23.060 --> 02:48:28.620]  out he helped write the great reset in the war for the world and he has written
[02:48:28.620 --> 02:48:32.500]  two other New York Times bestsellers that he wrote and it way he took all my
[02:48:32.500 --> 02:48:36.020]  recordings and condensed notes and what we're doing and condensed it down was
[02:48:36.020 --> 02:48:41.020]  just masterful I really appreciate him and he's here with us in studio so so
[02:48:41.020 --> 02:48:45.420]  big picture how do you see the struggle for humanity for freedom versus the
[02:48:45.420 --> 02:48:48.780]  scientific technological elite the controls the military industrial
[02:48:48.780 --> 02:48:52.380]  complex that Eisenhower warned of where would you say team humanity is right
[02:48:52.380 --> 02:48:56.740]  now your view on the midderms Biden all of this garbage yeah I think what's
[02:48:56.740 --> 02:49:03.540]  really you know hopeful right now is that so much of this is coming out so with
[02:49:03.540 --> 02:49:09.260]  presidential takedown what I'm trying to convince the public of is the danger of
[02:49:09.260 --> 02:49:15.020]  this administrative deep state this administrative deep state would have gone
[02:49:15.020 --> 02:49:20.180]  after a president Robert F. Kennedy junior just as much as they have gone
[02:49:20.180 --> 02:49:27.100]  after president Donald Trump okay it's important to understand that we are not
[02:49:27.100 --> 02:49:33.260]  in control of our government this administrative deep state is exactly in
[02:49:33.260 --> 02:49:37.700]  whether Trump or JFK were good people they weren't perfect they wanted to be
[02:49:37.700 --> 02:49:44.700]  president that was a crime absolutely they wanted to move humanity forward so
[02:49:44.700 --> 02:49:50.860]  we've got really good people who want to move humanity forward but they go into
[02:49:50.860 --> 02:49:56.620]  this government and they find it's much worse than they ever imagined and I
[02:49:56.620 --> 02:50:02.740]  think what was great about what Paul detailed in the book is just how much
[02:50:02.740 --> 02:50:10.860]  trouble there was getting the slightest good bit of good science in so one of
[02:50:10.860 --> 02:50:15.660]  the things that everybody is talking about right now is the is you know the
[02:50:15.660 --> 02:50:22.620]  drop in student test scores okay did we have to close down the schools okay so
[02:50:22.620 --> 02:50:27.700]  what Paul detailed for me was the arguments that he was making in the
[02:50:27.700 --> 02:50:32.980]  summer of 2020 okay so this virus hits and you know let's leave aside the
[02:50:32.980 --> 02:50:36.700]  question of where it came from and everything but just say you know for
[02:50:36.700 --> 02:50:41.540]  most people it's a novel pathogen and and they really didn't know you know
[02:50:41.540 --> 02:50:45.500]  maybe it was gonna be like influenza maybe it was gonna spread easily among
[02:50:45.500 --> 02:50:50.220]  the young but what they so you know maybe closing down from March to June of
[02:50:50.220 --> 02:50:57.060]  2020 maybe that's justified but by the summer of 2020 it was really clear that
[02:50:57.060 --> 02:51:01.500]  the only way the virus could gain entry to the cell is through what's called
[02:51:01.500 --> 02:51:06.580]  like the ace receptor so you need to think of it like a flower okay that
[02:51:06.580 --> 02:51:12.820]  needs to bloom and open in order for the bee to land on it and get the pollen
[02:51:12.820 --> 02:51:20.860]  but what was clear is that in kids this ace to receptor is not really active
[02:51:20.860 --> 02:51:26.980]  okay so the kids may get an infection but they're not coming down with with
[02:51:26.980 --> 02:51:33.300]  serious symptoms they're not passing it and it was so clear and and what I
[02:51:33.300 --> 02:51:37.420]  really love about the book and and this is how I try to put all my books
[02:51:37.420 --> 02:51:44.500]  together is to have them abundantly cited and footnoted is Paul provided to
[02:51:44.500 --> 02:51:53.140]  me the emails that he sent listing all of the information about the fact that
[02:51:53.140 --> 02:51:58.260]  kids were fine if anything the kids should have been in school and the
[02:51:58.260 --> 02:52:02.340]  teacher should have been in masks but only when the teachers were meeting
[02:52:02.340 --> 02:52:07.780]  with other teachers because there was no threat from the students and so what
[02:52:07.780 --> 02:52:14.420]  Paul also details is how of course his emails got leaked and they took out four
[02:52:14.420 --> 02:52:21.980]  words from a long email long detailed scientific emailed and those four words
[02:52:21.980 --> 02:52:28.380]  were we want them infected and use that as the narrative to create this story
[02:52:28.380 --> 02:52:34.780]  that Dr. Alexander was somebody who wanted children to die okay that's why
[02:52:34.780 --> 02:52:38.660]  the mainline science shows the best community is getting it and then I mean
[02:52:38.660 --> 02:52:42.660]  we want the children we want to get through it we we now the study show
[02:52:42.660 --> 02:52:48.380]  locking us down and it worse yeah and he was making that argument using
[02:52:48.380 --> 02:52:54.420]  information from Dr. John Ionitis from Stanford University the Imperial War
[02:52:54.420 --> 02:52:58.540]  College so he's sending this to the the people yeah in the government trying to
[02:52:58.540 --> 02:53:02.620]  get a good policy they leak it to the media yeah and and and not only do they
[02:53:02.620 --> 02:53:06.660]  leak it to the media but they misrepresented to the media and that
[02:53:06.660 --> 02:53:10.620]  is just it's it's it's frightening because so this is Dr. Alexander is
[02:53:10.620 --> 02:53:16.420]  sorry to interrupt this is revenge well I I think it's it's Dr. Alexander's
[02:53:16.420 --> 02:53:22.300]  accounting of what went on because as I say I consider this book to be a first
[02:53:22.300 --> 02:53:27.900]  draft of our recent history does that mean it's the final draft no but this
[02:53:27.900 --> 02:53:34.580]  is the most authoritative draft currently available on what went on in those
[02:53:34.580 --> 02:53:40.820]  early months of the COVID-19 task force leading up to President Trump losing the
[02:53:40.820 --> 02:53:46.180]  election okay and so you have to ask yourself well if it's really clear to
[02:53:46.180 --> 02:53:51.700]  the scientists and in this summer of 2020 that students should be back in
[02:53:51.700 --> 02:53:58.140]  school what is the reason you keep them out of school to me the most likely
[02:53:58.140 --> 02:54:04.020]  explanation is that they knew it would upset parents and they would take out
[02:54:04.020 --> 02:54:07.980]  that frustration and anger on the president exactly it was a
[02:54:07.980 --> 02:54:13.740]  destabilization ever they admitted that later they have moved having an earth
[02:54:13.740 --> 02:54:17.820]  with big tech we have the documents now to suppress therapeutics true about the
[02:54:17.820 --> 02:54:21.100]  virus all of it that's why books like this are so revolutionary because they
[02:54:21.100 --> 02:54:24.740]  want to rewrite history as a fraud but there I think they're losing the fight
[02:54:24.740 --> 02:54:28.020]  to have their fraud be history I mean I think the evidence is we're winning
[02:54:28.020 --> 02:54:33.660]  thanks to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. yourself counts others yeah and it's it's kind of
[02:54:33.660 --> 02:54:41.340]  comical that the Atlantic comes out and says oh maybe we need an amnesty for all
[02:54:41.340 --> 02:54:47.700]  the people who were pushing lockdowns masking mandatory vaccinations that's
[02:54:47.700 --> 02:54:54.660]  just nuts but what it shows is it shows that we're winning because you know at
[02:54:54.660 --> 02:54:59.180]  the height of all of this people like me were banned people like Dr. Mike of
[02:54:59.180 --> 02:55:06.100]  it's I mean she had 175,000 followers on Twitter boom gone so you know we're
[02:55:06.100 --> 02:55:12.420]  still here we're not going away we're gonna keep writing books and they're
[02:55:12.420 --> 02:55:17.700]  gonna have to keep dealing with the fact that our books sell incredibly well how
[02:55:17.700 --> 02:55:21.460]  bad do you think the real Anthony Fauci hurt their system because I have
[02:55:21.460 --> 02:55:24.700]  everything I've seen under Peter McCulloch Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, our
[02:55:24.700 --> 02:55:30.020]  work here that one particular book will grievously wanted to lie it was a it was
[02:55:30.020 --> 02:55:36.580]  a fabulous book I got to read it in its draft form and it's it's just great and
[02:55:36.580 --> 02:55:43.900]  you know here's the thing as Americans we're gonna have different opinions okay
[02:55:43.900 --> 02:55:49.380]  I don't believe the same thing as Robert F. Kennedy on every political issue but
[02:55:49.380 --> 02:55:55.460]  here's what I know about Robert F. Kennedy he is an honest broker if he's
[02:55:55.460 --> 02:56:01.620]  moral he's real he's a good guy if Kennedy says something is true it's true
[02:56:01.620 --> 02:56:06.420]  he checks his facts we may disagree on interpretation about things about what
[02:56:06.420 --> 02:56:13.300]  should be done but I think that everybody across America needs not to look at
[02:56:13.300 --> 02:56:18.100]  at everybody else through the lens of politics but look at each other through
[02:56:18.100 --> 02:56:23.380]  the lens of character track records do you have integrity do you tell the truth
[02:56:23.380 --> 02:56:27.100]  and the thing they get kind of gets me about the books that I've written and
[02:56:27.100 --> 02:56:31.100]  I've I've also written books about big tech but I wrote Google leaks with the
[02:56:31.100 --> 02:56:35.740]  project Veritas whistleblower Zach four he's I wrote behind the mask of Facebook
[02:56:35.740 --> 02:56:44.380]  with Ryan Hartwig is what happens is there's this great silence with my
[02:56:44.380 --> 02:56:50.660]  books I I generally don't get viciously attacked they just act as if it's doesn't
[02:56:50.660 --> 02:56:57.420]  exist so I am pleading with the audience not because I wrote this book but
[02:56:57.420 --> 02:57:02.500]  because this is an amazing story of a man with remarkable we need to send a
[02:57:02.500 --> 02:57:07.220]  hundred copies to the Senate we knew we had this is a blueprint to bring him to
[02:57:07.220 --> 02:57:11.500]  justice because we know what they did we just got a blueprint to Congress yeah
[02:57:11.500 --> 02:57:15.780]  and you know I just want to say this really quickly you know with plague of
[02:57:15.780 --> 02:57:19.500]  corruption we always talked about God's divine timing that it came out right in
[02:57:19.500 --> 02:57:23.820]  the middle of the pandemic well this book comes out on November 15th when
[02:57:23.820 --> 02:57:27.540]  Trump is going to make a big announcement so I'm hopeful that the
[02:57:27.540 --> 02:57:32.580]  mainstream media will literally attack this book and Trump at the same time
[02:57:32.580 --> 02:57:36.220]  because that's how we win that's right the books I'm announcing up a shooting

[03:00:12.380 --> 03:00:16.940]  Kent Hickenlibele's our guest they found the clip from Eisenhower's full
[03:00:16.940 --> 03:00:21.380]  speech that nobody ever plays we're gonna hit that next segment and then Jay
[03:00:21.380 --> 03:00:26.940]  Dyer takes over but we we kick that break just talking about the state of the
[03:00:26.940 --> 03:00:31.100]  world how do you think the deep states doing right now I mean they they're
[03:00:31.100 --> 03:00:33.300]  on internal documents they're really upset they're really scared of the
[03:00:33.300 --> 03:00:35.860]  trumpet and and then what do you agree with that or disagree and what do you
[03:00:35.860 --> 03:00:41.220]  think they're gonna do next? I think the deep state is really concerned and you
[03:00:41.220 --> 03:00:48.180]  know I think that a lot of times people are scared of these large powerful
[03:00:48.180 --> 03:00:55.860]  entities but when you go behind the curtain you see that they may not be as
[03:00:55.860 --> 03:01:01.660]  smart as you fear they are so I think it's so important that we just keep
[03:01:01.660 --> 03:01:06.780]  fighting and that's why when I was given the opportunity to help with your book
[03:01:06.780 --> 03:01:12.180]  I just I jumped at the chance I I said yes even though there was so much going
[03:01:12.180 --> 03:01:17.060]  on in my life I just felt like somebody like you needs to be supported and in
[03:01:17.060 --> 03:01:20.340]  the wonderful work that you do you really help condense it down great job
[03:01:20.340 --> 03:01:26.820]  yeah and I just I kind of feel like we all need to come together to support
[03:01:26.820 --> 03:01:34.740]  each other to support our right to question things to you know I'll be the
[03:01:34.740 --> 03:01:41.220]  first to say yes I write these books yes I abundantly document what I say but I
[03:01:41.220 --> 03:01:46.620]  am the first person who was willing to have a conversation with the other side
[03:01:46.620 --> 03:01:53.100]  I would would welcome the opportunity to sit across the table from Anthony Fauci
[03:01:53.100 --> 03:01:58.740]  Deborah Birx any of these people talk to them I would have you know the book I
[03:01:58.740 --> 03:02:03.220]  wrote about Facebook I would sit across the table from Mark Zuckerberg I would
[03:02:03.220 --> 03:02:08.260]  sit across the table from Sundar Pichai but what happens is they avoid these
[03:02:08.260 --> 03:02:15.340]  conversations so you know I'm here I'm friendly I want to have respectful debate
[03:02:15.340 --> 03:02:18.540]  about these issues but they don't want that because they don't see us as players
[03:02:18.540 --> 03:02:25.620]  no no they don't and you know all I'm gonna do is keep offering and making it
[03:02:25.620 --> 03:02:31.940]  so clear that they are ducking these fights and these conversations and the
[03:02:31.940 --> 03:02:38.020]  American public is getting tired of them not coming out and debating us they do
[03:02:38.020 --> 03:02:42.860]  it with Robert Kennedy they've done it with you they've done it with Dr. Andrew
[03:02:42.860 --> 03:02:47.500]  Wakefield they've done it with Dr. Judy Mike of its they've done it with James
[03:02:47.500 --> 03:02:53.860]  O'Keeffe Project Veritas I mean why isn't James O'Keeffe on every single news
[03:02:53.860 --> 03:02:56.900]  broadcast totally so what do you think they're gonna do now that are so cornered
[03:02:56.900 --> 03:03:06.780]  I wish I knew I think we're in a dangerous phase because I believe they
[03:03:06.780 --> 03:03:13.100]  are cornered and so I think it is just incumbent upon all of us to stay vigilant
[03:03:13.100 --> 03:03:22.300]  because we have the have the capability to stop their plans they really don't
[03:03:22.300 --> 03:03:28.740]  want an informed public so maybe it's just 10% of the population that really
[03:03:28.740 --> 03:03:35.020]  needs to be informed in that 10% can be leaders for the rest of the population
[03:03:35.020 --> 03:03:40.100]  so I think we're at a real critical moment I think this is a wonderful time
[03:03:40.100 --> 03:03:46.060]  for humanity because as much as it's it's you know difficult to hear these
[03:03:46.060 --> 03:03:52.700]  terrible things what we're also seeing is that the light of truth is is being
[03:03:52.700 --> 03:03:57.820]  shown on these things and I think that you know it looks terrible in the moment
[03:03:57.820 --> 03:04:02.220]  we're going through a storm but we're gonna get through that storm and get to
[03:04:02.220 --> 03:04:06.780]  the other side the answer is we've been in a storm for 30 40 50 60 years yeah
[03:04:06.780 --> 03:04:10.380]  getting different a tyranny we were asleep now you wake up the ships and all
[03:04:10.380 --> 03:04:13.660]  these big waves and storm and everything we're almost out of it you can actually
[03:04:13.660 --> 03:04:17.220]  see sun up a few miles ahead they're like oh my god this is horrible but
[03:04:17.220 --> 03:04:21.340]  actually we learn there were still some folks actually awake at the wheel and so
[03:04:21.340 --> 03:04:27.100]  as more people come awake we have more hands on deck yeah so so I'm excited you
[03:04:27.100 --> 03:04:31.780]  know it's it's interesting that I am starting to get recognized for my books
[03:04:31.780 --> 03:04:35.500]  I will talk to people and mention the books and they're familiar with the
[03:04:35.500 --> 03:04:39.940]  books so I think it's really a fabulous fabulous time I read there's a new
[03:04:39.940 --> 03:04:43.620]  renaissance happening and the power structure is gonna try to suppress us but
[03:04:43.620 --> 03:04:46.740]  as long as we're not intimidated they will fail when a play that eyes an hour
[03:04:46.740 --> 03:04:52.060]  clip final comment straight ahead and then J. Dyer takes over stay with us
[03:04:56.260 --> 03:05:02.300]  once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance American citizens
[03:05:02.300 --> 03:05:08.180]  should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit
[03:05:08.180 --> 03:05:11.580]  the first amendment is unique in the world that's what they want to take away
[03:05:11.580 --> 03:05:15.340]  your ability to speak freely so they're gonna go from Mike Lindell next or they
[03:05:15.340 --> 03:05:19.060]  gonna go for Steve Bannon are gonna go for Tucker Carlson I say the globalist
[03:05:19.060 --> 03:05:23.060]  30 years ago but on air 28 years and I knew they were planning all of this and
[03:05:23.060 --> 03:05:26.540]  I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere but I couldn't have done it without
[03:05:26.540 --> 03:05:29.900]  your support and now because we've been so successful warning the population of
[03:05:29.900 --> 03:05:33.700]  the planet honest America we're public enemy number one when it comes to the
[03:05:33.700 --> 03:05:37.140]  global agenda that's why it's more important than ever to realize how
[03:05:37.140 --> 03:05:41.180]  successful info wars has been because of your past support so I salute you and I
[03:05:41.180 --> 03:05:44.780]  thank you and I ask you now the critical juncture of the battle free double your

[03:06:03.980 --> 03:06:11.420]  it's Alex Jones I'm about to hand the baton to the great researcher Jay Dyer
[03:06:11.420 --> 03:06:16.660]  author in his own right we have a special guest here that helped me write
[03:06:16.660 --> 03:06:20.740]  the great reset in the war of the world Kent heck and lively he's also written
[03:06:20.740 --> 03:06:26.220]  his own new book dealing with what really happened with COVID and more but
[03:06:26.220 --> 03:06:31.860]  the 21-minute speech of Eisenhower in his farewell address in early 1961 before
[03:06:31.860 --> 03:06:34.980]  John F. Kennedy took over it's something everybody should watch it's online it's
[03:06:34.980 --> 03:06:40.580]  type in full farewell address president Dwight D. Eisenhower and he talks about
[03:06:40.580 --> 03:06:44.260]  how powerful corporate interests with money were taking control of government
[03:06:44.260 --> 03:06:48.300]  grants through ARPA and then DARPA and I was creating a technological elite in
[03:06:48.300 --> 03:06:52.340]  control of the military industrial complex and that's what Kent was getting
[03:06:52.340 --> 03:06:58.020]  into earlier 120 million dollars per presidential election cycle versus 5
[03:06:58.020 --> 03:07:01.620]  billion to elect a president but the big pharma being funded by the special
[03:07:01.620 --> 03:07:05.540]  interest getting 120 billion and that's how they've got control of society and
[03:07:05.540 --> 03:07:09.220]  that's what the globalist are going with the medical tyranny takeover so the tip
[03:07:09.220 --> 03:07:14.340]  of their spear is this technological elite using the biomedical system for
[03:07:14.340 --> 03:07:21.700]  control here it is akin to and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in
[03:07:21.700 --> 03:07:26.820]  our industrial military posture has been the technological revolution during
[03:07:26.820 --> 03:07:33.380]  recent decades in this revolution research research has become central it
[03:07:33.380 --> 03:07:39.980]  also becomes more formalized complex and costly a steadily increasing share is
[03:07:39.980 --> 03:07:46.300]  conducted for by or at the direction of the federal government today the
[03:07:46.300 --> 03:07:52.420]  solitary inventor tinkering in his shop has been overshadowed by task forces of
[03:07:52.420 --> 03:08:00.140]  scientists in laboratories and testing fields in the same fashion the free
[03:08:00.140 --> 03:08:05.980]  university versatility historically the fountainhead of free ideas and
[03:08:05.980 --> 03:08:11.980]  scientific discovery has experienced a revolution in the conductive research
[03:08:11.980 --> 03:08:17.460]  partly because of the huge cost involved a government contract becomes
[03:08:17.460 --> 03:08:24.700]  virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity for every old blackboard
[03:08:24.700 --> 03:08:31.100]  there are now hundreds of new electronic computers the prospect of
[03:08:31.100 --> 03:08:37.020]  domination of the nation's scholars by federal employment project allocations
[03:08:37.020 --> 03:08:43.260]  and the power of money is ever present and is greatly to be regarded yet in
[03:08:43.260 --> 03:08:49.220]  holding scientific research and discovery in respect as we should we must
[03:08:49.220 --> 03:08:55.180]  also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself
[03:08:55.180 --> 03:09:02.620]  become the captive of a scientific technological elite is the task of
[03:09:02.620 --> 03:09:08.220]  statesmanship to mold to balance and to integrate these and other forces new and
[03:09:08.220 --> 03:09:13.100]  old within the principles of our democratic system okay so when that came out
[03:09:13.100 --> 03:09:17.140]  the media immediately said military industrial complex which he then the
[03:09:17.140 --> 03:09:21.860]  next minute says is the subordinate of the technocrats they call themselves
[03:09:21.860 --> 03:09:27.260]  technocrats so if we don't understand this we understand nothing and so here's
[03:09:27.260 --> 03:09:32.260]  eyes now a pro-america you know not anti-establishment he said want monopolies
[03:09:32.260 --> 03:09:36.540]  control everybody that's where we are and yet that's what you're exposing in
[03:09:36.540 --> 03:09:40.620]  your book and that's exactly what we're talking about yeah presidential take
[03:09:40.620 --> 03:09:49.940]  down is nothing more than the metastasization of that cancer okay so
[03:09:49.940 --> 03:09:55.300]  everything that people have been saying could the critics have been saying for
[03:09:55.300 --> 03:10:03.420]  30 40 50 years came to fruition in COVID-19 and so that was it's coming out
[03:10:03.420 --> 03:10:09.460]  it's takeover yeah that it was it's offensive it was the takeover and we
[03:10:09.460 --> 03:10:13.940]  need to fight back fight to get our freedom back just as Hitler invented
[03:10:13.940 --> 03:10:18.540]  Russia this is their Barbarossa yeah presidential take down is is the
[03:10:18.540 --> 03:10:24.660]  counter to this move that's why it's so important that people get it they read it
[03:10:24.660 --> 03:10:30.420]  to understand this is not about team red or team blue this is about team
[03:10:30.420 --> 03:10:35.580]  humanity and let's expand on that he said a scientific technological elite
[03:10:35.580 --> 03:10:40.700]  will censor and control everybody else and create a monopoly of ideas and
[03:10:40.700 --> 03:10:44.380]  that's the great danger and now we're told science is not questioning it's
[03:10:44.380 --> 03:10:47.500]  doing what we're told exactly what I was now are warned of the opposite of science
[03:10:47.500 --> 03:10:53.460]  yeah a hundred percent yes a smart guy yeah very impressive yeah I made that
[03:10:53.460 --> 03:10:57.620]  like he wrote that speech he wrote a speech it's not some speech writer if you
[03:10:57.620 --> 03:11:03.140]  read the the biographies of Eisenhower it is clear that he was a brilliant man
[03:11:03.140 --> 03:11:05.740]  well he had some of the people that a man had project others coming in and
[03:11:05.740 --> 03:11:08.540]  bossing him around at the end yeah he was like who do you think you are I
[03:11:08.540 --> 03:11:14.020]  represent the voters yep yep yeah so so I think that this is something for all
[03:11:14.020 --> 03:11:19.300]  Americans because we like to believe that when we go and vote then the
[03:11:19.300 --> 03:11:27.260]  bureaucracy of government responds to the will of that elected leader and as
[03:11:27.260 --> 03:11:34.700]  Paul Alexander details that is not what's happening in fact the government
[03:11:34.700 --> 03:11:42.540]  bureaucrats they don't believe in we the people their frame of reference is we in
[03:11:42.540 --> 03:11:49.420]  the bureaucracy and that is terrifying to if you're on the right if you're on
[03:11:49.420 --> 03:11:54.220]  the left in your if you're in the middle and we get this clip out we have our own
[03:11:54.220 --> 03:11:57.220]  big audience but we're captured here like the Phantom Zone when you get that
[03:11:57.220 --> 03:12:00.300]  message to liberals they might wake up but they're literally in a mind control

[03:12:58.220 --> 03:13:01.980]  Welcome back to the Altshaw Jones show I'm your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's
[03:13:01.980 --> 03:13:09.380]  analysis and you know I want to talk to you I want to talk to you about the big
[03:13:09.380 --> 03:13:15.540]  news coming out about Kanye and his celebrity handler we have in the world
[03:13:15.540 --> 03:13:19.060]  of alternative media for many many years people have speculated people have
[03:13:19.060 --> 03:13:23.300]  theorized people talked about the possibility that in fact a lot of these
[03:13:23.300 --> 03:13:28.060]  celebrities are handled that they might even have sort of deep state shadow
[03:13:28.060 --> 03:13:31.860]  government people in the background maybe telling them what to do what they
[03:13:31.860 --> 03:13:36.460]  can and can't do maybe part of their contracts and in the last year we've
[03:13:36.460 --> 03:13:41.020]  seen two of the biggest celebrities out there put out information that in fact
[03:13:41.020 --> 03:13:46.180]  suggests that this is the case now first there was a Britney Spears who in the
[03:13:46.180 --> 03:13:49.500]  last as we know year year and a half maybe two years it's come out about her
[03:13:49.500 --> 03:13:55.140]  conservatorship and that she's kind of in this sort of prison situation and a lot
[03:13:55.140 --> 03:14:01.380]  of people speculated that her bizarre out outbreaks of you know weird actions
[03:14:01.380 --> 03:14:05.580]  and all the stuff she does on her Instagram and perhaps even going back
[03:14:05.580 --> 03:14:10.220]  many years to the 2000s when she had that famous breakdown and she shaved her
[03:14:10.220 --> 03:14:15.300]  head and all this kind of stuff that this had to do with her being under some
[03:14:15.300 --> 03:14:19.100]  kind of control so kind of mind control so this was speculated for a long time
[03:14:19.100 --> 03:14:25.180]  but there wasn't hard evidence other than various researchers saying that you
[03:14:25.180 --> 03:14:29.860]  know they might be sent back to psych wars and mental institutes for
[03:14:29.860 --> 03:14:36.020]  reprogramming and what do you know we find out from Kanye's tweets that he
[03:14:36.020 --> 03:14:41.220]  shared allegedly from his personal trainer that there was this threat that
[03:14:41.220 --> 03:14:45.980]  he would be sent back to the psych ward and he would be drugged into zombie
[03:14:45.980 --> 03:14:51.220]  lamp and then we had other celebrities you know sort of chiming in and talking
[03:14:51.220 --> 03:14:56.380]  about this with Kanye who then ended up soon passing away I don't know the
[03:14:56.380 --> 03:15:00.740]  details of those of that passing away but it's just odd the timing it's odd
[03:15:00.740 --> 03:15:03.660]  what's going on with the celebrity so today I want to give a little bit of a
[03:15:03.660 --> 03:15:08.500]  background on the history of the deep connections between the deep state and
[03:15:08.500 --> 03:15:13.940]  Hollywood celebrities and this goes beyond just a trainer you know something
[03:15:13.940 --> 03:15:17.940]  like this this this has to do with many celebrities being recruited into spy work
[03:15:17.940 --> 03:15:22.460]  and to be assets I'm not saying that Kanye is a spy or Britney Spears I don't
[03:15:22.460 --> 03:15:27.140]  know that I'm just pointing out that we do know in the cases of many past A-list
[03:15:27.140 --> 03:15:31.700]  celebrities that they were recruited to do espionage work and this is a maybe a
[03:15:31.700 --> 03:15:36.980]  context for explaining and giving some insight into what might be going on in
[03:15:36.980 --> 03:15:41.420]  the case of Kanye, Britney and other stars who have their careers destroyed
[03:15:41.420 --> 03:15:46.780]  after they say and divulge certain pieces of information that are not supposed
[03:15:46.780 --> 03:15:51.260]  to be out there or how Hollywood is controlled so don't go anywhere this is
[03:15:51.260 --> 03:15:55.340]  the oxygen from your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis
[03:15:55.340 --> 03:16:02.300]  think about a world without info wars just take a moment and sit back and
[03:16:02.300 --> 03:16:06.580]  think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken
[03:16:06.580 --> 03:16:12.660]  together this family that is info wars think about how info wars is cited by
[03:16:12.660 --> 03:16:17.300]  Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like
[03:16:17.300 --> 03:16:24.460]  Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to
[03:16:24.460 --> 03:16:29.100]  defeat the New World Order the only reason humanity's still in the fight
[03:16:29.100 --> 03:16:34.180]  today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken
[03:16:34.180 --> 03:16:39.460]  action and supported this show I don't take the credit I give you the credit
[03:16:39.460 --> 03:16:43.620]  the credit and now info wars is facing its darkest hours it isn't gonna give
[03:16:43.620 --> 03:16:48.700]  up without your support we can be shut down please go to save info wars calm
[03:16:48.700 --> 03:16:55.100]  today save info wars calm today and donate for our legal defense fund
[03:16:55.100 --> 03:17:00.340]  don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful
[03:17:00.340 --> 03:17:04.980]  at silencing you and the globalist number one mission is to silence info

[03:20:11.260 --> 03:20:14.540]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm your guest test Jay Dyer of Jays
[03:20:14.540 --> 03:20:21.540]  Analysis we're covering this murky amazing backwater discussion of the
[03:20:21.540 --> 03:20:27.780]  history of Hollywood intelligence agencies spying celebrity mind control now
[03:20:27.780 --> 03:20:32.900]  this has been relegated as we said for many years to the kooky crazy land and
[03:20:32.900 --> 03:20:37.500]  it's just wild it's out there and yet in the last year we've had two of the
[03:20:37.500 --> 03:20:41.580]  biggest celebrities out there come out with claims that they have been mind
[03:20:41.580 --> 03:20:45.260]  controlled that they have been put in a to a state of being a psychiatric
[03:20:45.260 --> 03:20:49.860]  committed to being drugged or simply drugged perhaps even and that this is a
[03:20:49.860 --> 03:20:53.940]  in some way you know controlling them and what they can and can't say and where
[03:20:53.940 --> 03:20:58.980]  they can and can't go especially in the case of Britney Spears so I know that
[03:20:58.980 --> 03:21:02.940]  you know we don't really I think people are wising up to Hollywood and the music
[03:21:02.940 --> 03:21:07.060]  industry and how controlled this is and it's not the most important thing but
[03:21:07.060 --> 03:21:11.860]  the reason it does matter is that it's it demonstrates a long-term relationship
[03:21:11.860 --> 03:21:17.660]  between between two seemingly disparate worlds that are actually connected at the
[03:21:17.660 --> 03:21:21.420]  hip and so this is part of what prompted prompted me to write two books on the
[03:21:21.420 --> 03:21:25.540]  history of Hollywood and you know the shadow government connections and the
[03:21:25.540 --> 03:21:30.540]  history of spying and famous celebrity so let's look at some of that because it
[03:21:30.540 --> 03:21:34.060]  also applies to the to the music genre as well right it's not just that it's in
[03:21:34.060 --> 03:21:38.020]  Hollywood also obviously the music industry has similar connections in this
[03:21:38.020 --> 03:21:43.420]  way and it also extends it to the sport sports domain a professional sports now
[03:21:43.420 --> 03:21:49.380]  I'm not that knowledgeable of the domain of professional sports and and I can't
[03:21:49.380 --> 03:21:52.020]  speak too much to that but I do know about the history of Hollywood and the
[03:21:52.020 --> 03:21:56.380]  history of the music industry and we are being vindicated you know this is
[03:21:56.380 --> 03:21:59.700]  something that people really make fun of for a long time this is one of the key
[03:21:59.700 --> 03:22:03.380]  reasons why I was a crazy tenfold hat lunatic was that I talked about
[03:22:03.380 --> 03:22:07.380]  celebrity handlers and mind control and all this kind of stuff and turns out
[03:22:07.380 --> 03:22:12.820]  it's pretty pretty well vindicated and but and why would that be why would we
[03:22:12.820 --> 03:22:15.540]  have this relationship well if you remember in Edward Bernays's book
[03:22:15.540 --> 03:22:21.700]  propaganda he says that we in the so-called democracy are controlled by
[03:22:21.700 --> 03:22:26.380]  an invisible group of people that most people have no idea that's the first
[03:22:26.380 --> 03:22:31.180]  page of propaganda by Edward Bernays in one way one of the most powerful ways
[03:22:31.180 --> 03:22:34.940]  that Bernays later points out in that book is that Hollywood is one of the
[03:22:34.940 --> 03:22:40.300]  greatest engines of propaganda the world's ever known and this was realized
[03:22:40.300 --> 03:22:46.700]  a long time ago and so a lot of adept admin and psychological warfare guys and
[03:22:46.700 --> 03:22:52.860]  people in the OSS and all these different you know wartime entities figured
[03:22:52.860 --> 03:22:59.900]  out that they could utilize stars and celebrities for propaganda for product
[03:22:59.900 --> 03:23:02.380]  placement for all these kinds of things that most people probably are familiar
[03:23:02.380 --> 03:23:06.540]  with but maybe not a lot of people don't know that a lot of the celebrities
[03:23:06.540 --> 03:23:11.220]  especially A-listers were actually recruited into spying in some of the
[03:23:11.220 --> 03:23:17.260]  famous cases we go all the way back to you know even the early Hollywood 1930s
[03:23:17.260 --> 03:23:23.700]  and 40s it's pretty well documented that Errol Flynn for example was a spy who
[03:23:23.700 --> 03:23:30.660]  was more or less a favorable to a tiny mustache man Hitler himself and as a
[03:23:30.660 --> 03:23:34.420]  result of the possibility of certain people in Hollywood favoring
[03:23:34.420 --> 03:23:40.460]  potentially the the fascist or the the Nazis there were other people in
[03:23:40.460 --> 03:23:44.660]  Hollywood recruited to spy on other people in Hollywood Harry Grant for
[03:23:44.660 --> 03:23:51.180]  example Harry Grant was asked by MI6 and the OSS to spy on potential
[03:23:51.180 --> 03:23:57.860]  Hitlerian allies in 30s 40s Hollywood and that included him informing on Errol
[03:23:57.860 --> 03:24:04.300]  Flynn director John Houston for example was famously a member of the OSS
[03:24:04.300 --> 03:24:10.260]  if we think about Julia Child the famous TV cook she was a member of the OSS the
[03:24:10.260 --> 03:24:16.300]  predecessor to the CA if we think about people like Marlene Dietrich right the
[03:24:16.300 --> 03:24:21.340]  famous actor she has a long wild history of sort of flip-flopping and being
[03:24:21.340 --> 03:24:26.900]  suspected by both sides of being a spy for both ally and Axis Powers and she
[03:24:26.900 --> 03:24:31.340]  offered to spy for the US for the US for the West and they weren't that
[03:24:31.340 --> 03:24:37.180]  interested in her and ironically then the FBI began to investigate Marlene
[03:24:37.180 --> 03:24:42.500]  Dietrich at the same time as the FBI was investigating her and was suspicious of
[03:24:42.500 --> 03:24:47.420]  her she then was giving secrets to the OSS so there's this amazing history of
[03:24:47.420 --> 03:24:50.500]  all of these famous A-listers and you think well why would this be this sounds
[03:24:50.500 --> 03:24:54.820]  crazy well it's not crazy if you think about it because what does a celebrity
[03:24:54.820 --> 03:25:00.900]  have a celebrity has tremendous access to places that most people don't have
[03:25:00.900 --> 03:25:05.540]  access to celebrities are invited to gallows and to dinners and to social
[03:25:05.540 --> 03:25:10.620]  events and to meet royalty and to meet presidents and you know the richest
[03:25:10.620 --> 03:25:17.100]  people in the world so it makes perfect sense that celebrities potentially would
[03:25:17.100 --> 03:25:27.260]  be high-power recruitment subjects if we look back to the time of the Cold War we
[03:25:27.260 --> 03:25:33.260]  can note to that Jimmy Stewart Jimmy Stewart was actually looking at history
[03:25:33.260 --> 03:25:37.900]  he was kind of actually a badass Jimmy Stewart was a he flew a lot of combat
[03:25:37.900 --> 03:25:42.660]  missions he was raised to the level eventually of two-star general which is
[03:25:42.660 --> 03:25:45.820]  something that I don't think anybody else in Hollywood even came close to and
[03:25:45.820 --> 03:25:51.460]  not only did he fall fly all these bump bump bombarding miss missions during
[03:25:51.460 --> 03:25:58.660]  World War two and afterwards he remained for many many decades a reserve
[03:25:58.660 --> 03:26:03.580]  member of the Air Force and throughout that time Jimmy Stewart worked very
[03:26:03.580 --> 03:26:07.700]  closely with the FBI in fact he even put out a whole movie about the FBI called the
[03:26:07.700 --> 03:26:12.580]  FBI story he's involved in a lot of propaganda footage from Laurel Canyon
[03:26:12.580 --> 03:26:17.460]  Studios where he was up there sort of promoting and noting that the FBI was
[03:26:17.460 --> 03:26:20.980]  this great entity that was going to save everybody from communism and and I'm
[03:26:20.980 --> 03:26:24.380]  not doubting his sincerity and courage I'm sure Jimmy Stewart was really
[03:26:24.380 --> 03:26:29.020]  sincerely wanting to keep America free from communism all that and that's all
[03:26:29.020 --> 03:26:33.580]  noble but it still is illustrative for you know one of the biggest A-listers in
[03:26:33.580 --> 03:26:38.260]  Hollywood history up there with Kerry Grant you know was so closely doing
[03:26:38.260 --> 03:26:43.620]  spying work for the FBI the same with Walt Disney Walt Disney was working very
[03:26:43.620 --> 03:26:48.900]  closely with the FBI throughout that entire you know Cold War period and this
[03:26:48.900 --> 03:26:54.060]  partly explains why Walt was able to get the land in Disneyland that he got and
[03:26:54.060 --> 03:26:57.620]  he was he's actually given a lot of help from the CIA the CIA is actually who
[03:26:57.620 --> 03:27:02.020]  helped Walt Disney get that land and set up Disney and all that in Florida and
[03:27:02.020 --> 03:27:06.180]  so there's a fascinating history with with that and again I'm not knocking
[03:27:06.180 --> 03:27:09.660]  these people as if I'm saying that they're all they're bad because you know
[03:27:09.660 --> 03:27:13.900]  they were they're always recruited for the purpose of patriotism and remember
[03:27:13.900 --> 03:27:17.820]  that you know most people who go into Hollywood or who go into especially at
[03:27:17.820 --> 03:27:21.260]  this time you know they didn't know how the world really worked they didn't know
[03:27:21.260 --> 03:27:25.180]  that there was all these you know oligarchs and power players that were
[03:27:25.180 --> 03:27:27.820]  trying to manipulate people there they're just actors trying to get work
[03:27:27.820 --> 03:27:32.060]  trying to get a job and then they're usually recruited on the basis of
[03:27:32.060 --> 03:27:36.980]  patriotism don't you want to serve your country well we might need you to inform
[03:27:36.980 --> 03:27:41.740]  on people and again this is this is well known in the history of Hollywood
[03:27:41.740 --> 03:27:46.180]  think of also of famous people like Coco Chanel right Coco Chanel is one of
[03:27:46.180 --> 03:27:50.460]  these people who was a sort of a famous celebrity from the modeling and perfume
[03:27:50.460 --> 03:27:55.740]  world and fashion world and of course she was I think pretty well documented to
[03:27:55.740 --> 03:28:01.020]  have been a spy who had Nazi sympathies so all throughout Hollywood we have all
[03:28:01.020 --> 03:28:05.420]  these people recruited people famously involved in espionage where this also is
[03:28:05.420 --> 03:28:12.700]  the character of Audrey Hepburn Audrey Hepburn was actually involved in espionage
[03:28:12.700 --> 03:28:19.500]  work because I think for a time she was exiled and underwent a famine I think in
[03:28:19.500 --> 03:28:24.260]  Belgium or somewhere at one point and then this led her to inform and give
[03:28:24.260 --> 03:28:29.340]  information and pass secrets to the resistance during World War II against
[03:28:29.340 --> 03:28:35.860]  the Nazis so even Audrey Hepburn had a role to play in espionage at that time
[03:28:35.860 --> 03:28:40.780]  and a lot of this has only recently come out so keep in mind that what was
[03:28:40.780 --> 03:28:46.580]  speculated and said to be the case you know in the 90s 2000s 2010 2010s by a
[03:28:46.580 --> 03:28:49.900]  lot of alternative researchers and theorists and even mainline historians
[03:28:49.900 --> 03:28:54.460]  has now been vindicated this is all come out much more on the flip side don't
[03:28:54.460 --> 03:29:01.540]  go anywhere this is the option I'm pointing my finger at you and I'm also

[03:33:02.660 --> 03:33:05.340]  Jones
[03:33:10.380 --> 03:33:14.940]  welcome back to the Alex Jones on your guest host J Dyer Jason Alses we're
[03:33:14.940 --> 03:33:19.220]  talking about this murky history of the relationship between Hollywood
[03:33:19.220 --> 03:33:24.140]  celebrities music industry and intelligence and beef state handling and
[03:33:24.140 --> 03:33:29.220]  operations and is this well documented do we have a good basis to say this is
[03:33:29.220 --> 03:33:33.460]  just this wild speculations and theories well we've been through several of the
[03:33:33.460 --> 03:33:38.500]  most famous people in classic Hollywood but what about outside of America what
[03:33:38.500 --> 03:33:42.140]  about outside of Hollywood well there's a quite a few famous people that were
[03:33:42.140 --> 03:33:48.580]  also in other countries recruited and to spy work there's this character I didn't
[03:33:48.580 --> 03:33:51.260]  even know about this until fairly recently that there's a new movie that
[03:33:51.260 --> 03:33:56.180]  came out a few years ago it's a foreign I think it's a film from Norway or
[03:33:56.180 --> 03:34:02.220]  Swedish film and this is about the the A-Lister Sweden her name was Sonja
[03:34:02.220 --> 03:34:07.220]  Wiegert and Sonja Wiegert was the biggest celebrity out there in regard
[03:34:07.220 --> 03:34:12.940]  probably in Europe maybe at the time and her story is that at the time of
[03:34:12.940 --> 03:34:19.260]  World War two she was recruited by her government to spy for the allies against
[03:34:19.260 --> 03:34:24.700]  the Nazi high command now that might sound like you know a noble thing to do
[03:34:24.700 --> 03:34:30.380]  but the problem is that her government expected her to become basically a Nazi
[03:34:30.380 --> 03:34:34.820]  thought she was supposed to sleep around with the high command and she was
[03:34:34.820 --> 03:34:37.900]  cajoled into this actually she didn't really want to do this she was happy
[03:34:37.900 --> 03:34:40.900]  being an actress who wouldn't want to be a you know a list celebrity or
[03:34:40.900 --> 03:34:45.740]  whatever and now and now you have to spy and sleep with these people and of
[03:34:45.740 --> 03:34:50.260]  course she was more or less forced into this I think her dad was arrested by the
[03:34:50.260 --> 03:34:53.660]  government to sort of cajole her into it because she didn't want to do this and
[03:34:53.660 --> 03:34:58.100]  she got a really bad reputation that's pretty much ruined her film career and
[03:34:58.100 --> 03:35:02.460]  of course all of her native country folk just thought she was you know
[03:35:02.460 --> 03:35:09.300]  hoeing around with the Nazi high command you know to to bees sassy and
[03:35:09.300 --> 03:35:14.100]  lascivious and it's only recently come out I guess now that a lot of this has
[03:35:14.100 --> 03:35:19.300]  been declassified that she was forced into spy work so we have to be careful I
[03:35:19.300 --> 03:35:22.860]  think when we you know make judgments on a lot of the celebrities and these
[03:35:22.860 --> 03:35:26.420]  kind because a lot of these people are no one their damage they might be brought
[03:35:26.420 --> 03:35:31.460]  up in abusive situations or homes that sold them into the machinery of
[03:35:31.460 --> 03:35:36.580]  celebrity stardom because a lot of parents are also partly guilty for that
[03:35:36.580 --> 03:35:41.500]  stuff and at the same time we don't know what these people are being forced into
[03:35:41.500 --> 03:35:45.620]  doing so we have to be careful I think I'm making these judgments because Sonya
[03:35:45.620 --> 03:35:49.100]  Weigert's a great example of somebody who you know this really wasn't her fault
[03:35:49.100 --> 03:35:53.540]  she was forced into this kind of stuff and her her case is fascinating and
[03:35:53.540 --> 03:35:57.420]  interesting and it makes for a really good film if it's it's on you know out
[03:35:57.420 --> 03:36:01.060]  there to rent if you've never seen it's just called spy the the story of Sonya
[03:36:01.060 --> 03:36:05.220]  Weigert I do recommend it's a very well-made movie that relates to what
[03:36:05.220 --> 03:36:10.300]  we're talking about and she's not the only example that also there's also in
[03:36:10.300 --> 03:36:14.540]  the Soviet Union there was the famous actress maybe not as famous as some of
[03:36:14.540 --> 03:36:19.260]  the other people but she was she was known by according to Hitler as the one
[03:36:19.260 --> 03:36:23.620]  of the actresses of the Reich and her name was Olga Chekkova and Olga Chekkova
[03:36:23.620 --> 03:36:28.180]  was was forced into espionage work most likely it's not a hundred percent but it
[03:36:28.180 --> 03:36:33.100]  seems that way to spy for Stalin so she was actually I think Russian by birth
[03:36:33.100 --> 03:36:39.420]  but she somehow made her way into the Hollywood scene and into she was
[03:36:39.420 --> 03:36:42.540]  actually in one of the one of Hitchcock's films she was a leading lady in a
[03:36:42.540 --> 03:36:49.180]  Hitchcock film and then she ended up spying for Stalin on Hitler so again we
[03:36:49.180 --> 03:36:54.380]  find that this you know this this World War two time was especially rife with
[03:36:54.380 --> 03:36:57.860]  espionage work on the on the part of Hollywood people and you know these are
[03:36:57.860 --> 03:37:02.980]  only the stories that have come out I mean there's probably dozens more people
[03:37:02.980 --> 03:37:05.780]  who were involved in this kind of work that we don't even know about hasn't
[03:37:05.780 --> 03:37:11.020]  even been declassified hasn't even come out yet in regard to let me see if I've
[03:37:11.020 --> 03:37:15.300]  covered all the old people we can't forget the Christopher Lee all right
[03:37:15.300 --> 03:37:23.740]  Christopher Lee was famously a royal I think Royal Air Force RAF assassin and we
[03:37:23.740 --> 03:37:26.700]  don't know all of his missions but he did eventually disclose this it came out
[03:37:26.700 --> 03:37:30.220]  in the British press that again one of the most famous British actors of all
[03:37:30.220 --> 03:37:37.180]  time Christopher Lee Count Dooku right Saruman Saruman was involved in
[03:37:37.180 --> 03:37:42.580]  basically assassinating people and there's a funny clip on YouTube where
[03:37:42.580 --> 03:37:45.900]  he's talking to Peter Jackson when they're filming and they're talking
[03:37:45.900 --> 03:37:51.260]  about Saruman getting stabbed in the scene in Lord of the Rings and Peter
[03:37:51.260 --> 03:37:55.700]  Jackson says well I want you to scream out and Christopher Lee says well of
[03:37:55.700 --> 03:37:59.380]  course you won't scream when you're stabbed and he says how do you know and
[03:37:59.380 --> 03:38:02.860]  he says well because I was an assassin he says you get when you're stabbed and
[03:38:02.860 --> 03:38:07.500]  you're about you gasp for breath so allegedly and again it came out in the
[03:38:07.500 --> 03:38:12.780]  British press that Christopher Lee was involved in espionage work as well so
[03:38:12.780 --> 03:38:17.620]  again multiple people especially back in that 40s 50s time period were
[03:38:17.620 --> 03:38:20.180]  recruited into this kind of stuff yeah there's the clip where he's talking
[03:38:20.180 --> 03:38:24.300]  about it when of course we can't forget the famous examples of Ian Fleming I
[03:38:24.300 --> 03:38:27.860]  won't rehearse that because I've gone over that for you know multiple live
[03:38:27.860 --> 03:38:31.420]  streams multiple podcasts and talks even here on the fourth hour where we've
[03:38:31.420 --> 03:38:36.860]  talked about you know Ian Fleming having this deep connection with naval
[03:38:36.860 --> 03:38:41.660]  intelligence special operations executive and then going into you know
[03:38:41.660 --> 03:38:45.860]  Hollywood in the sense of writing screenplays and stories that would become
[03:38:45.860 --> 03:38:49.340]  big you know Hollywood screenplays and whatnot so that's an obvious connection
[03:38:49.340 --> 03:38:53.940]  there and then also John Wayne I'm not again I'm not accusing anybody being
[03:38:53.940 --> 03:38:57.460]  bad or saying that they were again this was all during a period when pretty much
[03:38:57.460 --> 03:39:01.340]  everybody was asked to do this for their country in some degree if you were a big
[03:39:01.340 --> 03:39:05.780]  celebrity I would I would suppose in the case of John Wayne there was some
[03:39:05.780 --> 03:39:09.100]  connection that he had with the OSS although we don't know exactly what
[03:39:09.100 --> 03:39:12.580]  that was into what what degree we know he really wanted to but a couple other
[03:39:12.580 --> 03:39:16.460]  older famous figures Frank Sinatra I think probably most people are aware of
[03:39:16.460 --> 03:39:21.020]  Frank Sinatra having a pretty close connection to both the FBI and organized
[03:39:21.020 --> 03:39:27.920]  crime being a kind of a go-between in that in that capacity and that also by
[03:39:27.920 --> 03:39:34.060]  extension seemed to implicate Marilyn Monroe to agree to a degree now I don't
[03:39:34.060 --> 03:39:39.340]  know it's not a confirmed that she was spying per se but she's kind of in the
[03:39:39.340 --> 03:39:44.900]  the fringes of this world because it does look like you know she was involved
[03:39:44.900 --> 03:39:48.540]  in sort of entrapment operations presumably with the Kennedys and she
[03:39:48.540 --> 03:39:53.340]  was sleeping not just with the Kennedys but also with Sam Giancana or Momo the
[03:39:53.340 --> 03:39:57.780]  faint one of the most famous or organized crime figures of that time who
[03:39:57.780 --> 03:40:02.740]  presumably then had some relationship to the JK assassination as well as the
[03:40:02.740 --> 03:40:06.900]  intelligence agency so there's a there's a deep connection there and in fact
[03:40:06.900 --> 03:40:10.580]  Marilyn Monroe turns out was investigated by the FBI because they
[03:40:10.580 --> 03:40:15.860]  thought she might be a Soviet and again that's probably not true but she was
[03:40:15.860 --> 03:40:19.940]  dating Arthur Miller at one point they may have come if they were married or
[03:40:19.940 --> 03:40:24.220]  just dating but I think he was suspected of you know communist leanings and so
[03:40:24.220 --> 03:40:29.420]  that then led to her being suspected as well another famous figure who had a
[03:40:29.420 --> 03:40:34.420]  connection is Lucky Luciano of course Lucky Luciano was working with Western
[03:40:34.420 --> 03:40:40.900]  intelligence to provide secrets to the Navy and I think also had obviously a
[03:40:40.900 --> 03:40:45.140]  Hollywood connections too so again the whole world of organized crime and mob
[03:40:45.140 --> 03:40:48.860]  that ties in as well I've done talks on that in the past too so I won't go into
[03:40:48.860 --> 03:40:51.820]  that but today we're covering a lot of figures that most people don't know
[03:40:51.820 --> 03:40:55.580]  about and one more figure that has recently turned up is a new book that
[03:40:55.580 --> 03:41:01.060]  just came out and this is the world of fashion and modeling and this is the
[03:41:01.060 --> 03:41:06.380]  character her name is Aline Griffith and Aline Griffith is the subject of a
[03:41:06.380 --> 03:41:11.180]  new book called The Princess Spy and she was a model from New York who was
[03:41:11.180 --> 03:41:16.580]  recruited into being a spy for the OSS and then later for the CIA in Spain and
[03:41:16.580 --> 03:41:25.460]  I'm not exactly sure if she was asked to marry the Count of Romanones in Spain
[03:41:25.460 --> 03:41:31.180]  or she wanted to but he was apparently the wealth one of the wealthiest men in
[03:41:31.180 --> 03:41:37.700]  Spain and suspected I think of having access power leanings and so she spied
[03:41:37.700 --> 03:41:42.900]  on you know the elites in Spain to make sure that they weren't leaning you know
[03:41:42.900 --> 03:41:48.820]  towards tiny mustache man so again over and over and over we see that this these
[03:41:48.820 --> 03:41:53.100]  stories come out about people from the fashion world from the modeling world
[03:41:53.100 --> 03:41:59.180]  from Hollywood the music industry they are recruited into this kind of work
[03:41:59.180 --> 03:42:04.300]  because of their power because of their access because of their because of their
[03:42:04.300 --> 03:42:08.700]  status and it it's not out of the ordinary when you know about this it
[03:42:08.700 --> 03:42:12.460]  makes perfect sense and this helps us to understand what might be going on in
[03:42:12.460 --> 03:42:16.780]  some of these cases of some of these celebrities who end up destroyed in the
[03:42:16.780 --> 03:42:23.140]  media or who end up having so-called breakdowns right maybe there's something
[03:42:23.140 --> 03:42:29.500]  more going on than just you know having a drug addiction right we're always told
[03:42:29.500 --> 03:42:32.140]  oh well they're just on they're all on drugs and they're all having meltdowns
[03:42:32.140 --> 03:42:37.620]  and well that may be the case it may also be the case that there's more going
[03:42:37.620 --> 03:42:41.380]  on in the background so again many many of these figures that we've covered were
[03:42:41.380 --> 03:42:45.340]  recruited and there's many many more I'll touch on a couple more when we come
[03:42:45.340 --> 03:42:49.180]  back a more recent Hollywood people that have admitted to having these kinds of
[03:42:49.180 --> 03:42:54.380]  relationships and if you enjoy this be sure to support Info Wars go to the

[03:45:05.660 --> 03:45:10.100]  fraud and corruption if we don't fix the system it doesn't matter whether
[03:45:10.100 --> 03:45:13.980]  republican nominees Donald Trump or governor de sanctimonious they're going
[03:45:13.980 --> 03:45:17.900]  to deny us Michigan they're going to deny us Pennsylvania they're going to deny
[03:45:17.900 --> 03:45:23.580]  us Arizona and I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those
[03:45:23.580 --> 03:45:29.060]  states where I believe there is an America first majority in every single
[03:45:29.060 --> 03:45:34.740]  one of them so we need to keep fighting for reform of the system Tucker Carlson
[03:45:34.740 --> 03:45:38.260]  said this better last night than anything else communications are the reason why
[03:45:38.260 --> 03:45:43.220]  we didn't well that's why info wars.com is so damn important that's why
[03:45:43.220 --> 03:45:47.420]  they're so desperate to take you off the air Alex people need to get behind
[03:45:47.420 --> 03:45:53.020]  info wars this alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally
[03:45:53.020 --> 03:45:57.580]  important we need more of this communications not less once a tragedy
[03:45:57.580 --> 03:46:03.580]  reaches a level of national significance American citizens should be allowed to
[03:46:03.580 --> 03:46:08.220]  basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit the first
[03:46:08.220 --> 03:46:11.420]  amendment is unique in the world that's what they want to take away your
[03:46:11.420 --> 03:46:14.780]  ability to speak freely so they're going to go from Mike Lindell next or they
[03:46:14.780 --> 03:46:18.060]  are going to go for Steve Bannon or they go for Tucker Carlson I studied the
[03:46:18.060 --> 03:46:21.980]  globalist 30 years ago but only 28 years and I knew they were planning all of
[03:46:21.980 --> 03:46:25.740]  this and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere but I couldn't have done it
[03:46:25.740 --> 03:46:28.780]  without your support and now because we've been so successful warning the
[03:46:28.780 --> 03:46:32.820]  population of the planet honest America we're public enemy number one when it
[03:46:32.820 --> 03:46:36.620]  comes to global agenda that's why it's more important than ever to realize how
[03:46:36.620 --> 03:46:40.660]  successful info wars has been because of your past support so I salute you and I

[03:46:53.980 --> 03:47:00.660]  thank you all for your support leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new
[03:47:00.660 --> 03:47:19.540]  world order it's Alex Jones and we were talking about this long time deep dark
[03:47:19.540 --> 03:47:25.380]  marriage between celebrities music industry and the beef state and the
[03:47:25.380 --> 03:47:29.100]  intelligence apparatus and we covered many many figures who famously sort of
[03:47:29.100 --> 03:47:33.060]  openly discussed this eventually or it was declassified or it came out in their
[03:47:33.060 --> 03:47:37.420]  biographies you know long after their death and you know this relationship
[03:47:37.420 --> 03:47:41.300]  continues into the modern period obviously I don't know all of the who
[03:47:41.300 --> 03:47:44.660]  might be a spy in modern Hollywood but a few people it's kind of come out and
[03:47:44.660 --> 03:47:49.500]  they've been kind of open and frank about this and we can think of examples
[03:47:49.500 --> 03:47:54.940]  like Jennifer Garner who when it when it when she was doing the show alias
[03:47:54.940 --> 03:48:00.260]  which is all about recruitment into the spy world and this was a JJ Abrams a
[03:48:00.260 --> 03:48:06.300]  spy story that was fairly popular thing and we ran for about six seasons and you
[03:48:06.300 --> 03:48:10.820]  know after that period she then and that show was by the way consulted on by the
[03:48:10.820 --> 03:48:16.380]  CIA she went on to do public CIA propaganda and promotional work PR work
[03:48:16.380 --> 03:48:21.300]  you know if her relationship was deeper than I don't know but she did in some
[03:48:21.300 --> 03:48:28.020]  capacity go on to work in that domain the same as the case with Angelina Jolie
[03:48:28.020 --> 03:48:36.420]  she went from training and having a CIA operative as her handler Melissa Mele
[03:48:36.420 --> 03:48:42.700]  from the movie Salt to then apparently being a member of the Council on Foreign
[03:48:42.700 --> 03:48:47.020]  Relations and sort of being public about this relationship where she then went on
[03:48:47.020 --> 03:48:51.020]  to do UN work and I think a lot of the a lot of people in Hollywood who have that
[03:48:51.020 --> 03:48:55.580]  kind of a relationship where they kind of move up that ladder they you know have
[03:48:55.580 --> 03:49:01.380]  these CIA handler trainer friend people that help out their career and consult
[03:49:01.380 --> 03:49:05.380]  and give them training then they tend to go on to work at the CFR of the United
[03:49:05.380 --> 03:49:10.500]  Nations that was the case with Audrey Hepburn who you know after her giving of
[03:49:10.500 --> 03:49:15.140]  secrets and information to the resistance that World War two she then went
[03:49:15.140 --> 03:49:20.540]  on to become a big United Nations person and that's the same I think when the
[03:49:20.540 --> 03:49:25.820]  character of Angelina Jolie she's also been involved in that kind of a of a
[03:49:25.820 --> 03:49:29.900]  role in something similar with the character George Clooney George Clooney
[03:49:29.900 --> 03:49:33.980]  appears to have had a lot of the similar patterns and background in terms of his
[03:49:33.980 --> 03:49:40.060]  work and then going on to doing that kind of work when it comes to I think he
[03:49:40.060 --> 03:49:45.100]  was the face of the the Darfur if you remember back several decades ago when
[03:49:45.100 --> 03:49:48.580]  it was the US needed to have an intervention when it came to Chad and
[03:49:48.580 --> 03:49:54.500]  Darfur that was a big thing that George Clooney was the face of and you know a
[03:49:54.500 --> 03:49:58.540]  lot of these people who are you never recruited into being the CFO in the CFR
[03:49:58.540 --> 03:50:01.940]  and whatnot I mean I think that kind of goes above even eventually the level of
[03:50:01.940 --> 03:50:06.700]  CIA but this also demonstrates the point that we're making and again like with
[03:50:06.700 --> 03:50:11.260]  Jennifer Garner we have the character of Ben Affleck Ben Affleck amazingly was
[03:50:11.260 --> 03:50:17.140]  very open about this where he basically said in an interview that's been around
[03:50:17.140 --> 03:50:20.400]  for many many years still public is still out there he said I think that in
[03:50:20.400 --> 03:50:26.140]  fact many people in Hollywood are also CIA and they're basically the same says
[03:50:26.140 --> 03:50:30.580]  flip sides the same coin basically and that was in relationship to the close
[03:50:30.580 --> 03:50:37.540]  connection that intelligence agencies had with his movie Argo and so again that
[03:50:37.540 --> 03:50:43.780]  led to a very open statement from him that movie was basically made with you
[03:50:43.780 --> 03:50:47.660]  know intelligence agency consultation and in fact in that interview he revealed
[03:50:47.660 --> 03:50:53.300]  that his relationship to this this Hollywood CIA marriage goes all the way
[03:50:53.300 --> 03:50:59.020]  back to some of all fears back in 2003 which was a you know war on terror style
[03:50:59.020 --> 03:51:04.620]  thing I think he's playing Jack Ryan at that time and in that in that case he
[03:51:04.620 --> 03:51:08.460]  says that that's where I was really introduced to that that's a level of
[03:51:08.460 --> 03:51:12.340]  propaganda in Hollywood and we see the same thing with movies like Zero Dark
[03:51:12.340 --> 03:51:18.820]  Thirty these are famously openly a CIA consulted movies the same is true with
[03:51:18.820 --> 03:51:27.700]  other films like the recruit with Al Pacino and I think Ryan Felipe or
[03:51:27.700 --> 03:51:31.940]  somebody like that is many many years ago those are all movies made with open
[03:51:31.940 --> 03:51:37.220]  CIA consultation and giving basically the narrative that they want those
[03:51:37.220 --> 03:51:43.060]  movies to have and although I'm not positive of the CIA directly there's
[03:51:43.060 --> 03:51:46.500]  also declassified documents for requests in the last several years that showed
[03:51:46.500 --> 03:51:53.820]  that dozens and dozens and dozens of movies TV shows or decades have had
[03:51:53.820 --> 03:51:59.500]  this deep level of propaganda and consultation and putting messages in
[03:51:59.500 --> 03:52:06.180]  right basically so that's now verified right so what all the degrees of that
[03:52:06.180 --> 03:52:09.660]  are whether it's all you know what we call predictive programming that's a
[03:52:09.660 --> 03:52:14.220]  further theory that you know they're sort of putting events that they intend
[03:52:14.220 --> 03:52:18.300]  to do in film I think there is a substantial evidence to prove that but
[03:52:18.300 --> 03:52:22.180]  the FOIA request documents are mainly about propaganda and so the idea there
[03:52:22.180 --> 03:52:27.060]  would be movies or TV shows that give messages about recruitment that give
[03:52:27.060 --> 03:52:31.540]  messages about you know future US conflicts that they want to you know
[03:52:31.540 --> 03:52:37.380]  pre pre-prepare and and program I guess you could say people to accept kind of
[03:52:37.380 --> 03:52:42.340]  the propaganda so we know that that's all the case the further level discussions
[03:52:42.340 --> 03:52:47.140]  of putting the future planned events is a little more speculative but there does
[03:52:47.140 --> 03:52:50.220]  seem to be a significant amount of information for that as well which could
[03:52:50.220 --> 03:52:53.860]  relate to or could explain a lot of the Simpsons predictions or the Family Guy
[03:52:53.860 --> 03:52:57.860]  predictions that you know kind of everybody on the internet knows about
[03:52:57.860 --> 03:53:01.820]  but this is again a very close relationship a very close marriage that
[03:53:01.820 --> 03:53:07.060]  has existed for many many years and we really only touched on some of the the
[03:53:07.060 --> 03:53:11.540]  key examples we didn't even really go into the world of literature and authors
[03:53:11.540 --> 03:53:16.300]  where many people from the world literature many famous authors a Graham
[03:53:16.300 --> 03:53:22.420]  Green you know Mockham T.E. Lawrence you know many of these famous writers were
[03:53:22.420 --> 03:53:26.420]  also directly connected to the intelligence world and again I'm not
[03:53:26.420 --> 03:53:31.020]  implicating them all it's having bad motives but it illustrates this point
[03:53:31.020 --> 03:53:34.940]  and I don't have any doubt that as we get further up into the modern period
[03:53:34.940 --> 03:53:39.860]  modern-day writers also have all those same perhaps connections and and
[03:53:39.860 --> 03:53:46.420]  desires and influences you know to try to to explain or to to turn the narrative
[03:53:46.420 --> 03:53:51.980]  and there's even a classic clip of I think John Le Carré where he's in an
[03:53:51.980 --> 03:53:55.860]  interview and he's talking about this relationship as well so he's one of the
[03:53:55.860 --> 03:53:59.980]  most famous you know espionage writers he's sort of the anti-James Bond writer
[03:53:59.980 --> 03:54:05.420]  he's the Tinker Taylor Soldier spy you know if you think about that's from
[03:54:05.420 --> 03:54:08.700]  that's from Le Carré the spy who came in from the cold with Richard Burton
[03:54:08.700 --> 03:54:13.380]  famously though that's another Le Carré story and if you go and watch that
[03:54:13.380 --> 03:54:16.460]  you'll you'll notice a lot of the parallels in that film as well you know
[03:54:16.460 --> 03:54:20.460]  in the spy who came in from the cold you know the the character of Richard
[03:54:20.460 --> 03:54:25.620]  Burton is given a cover story he's given a legend and he goes and he he tries to
[03:54:25.620 --> 03:54:32.260]  spy on Marxists and communists who run an occult bookstore and it turns out the
[03:54:32.260 --> 03:54:37.660]  occult bookstore is a front it's a cutout and so I'm my suspicion again I
[03:54:37.660 --> 03:54:41.760]  think what well found it is that Le Carré was pulling from his own
[03:54:41.760 --> 03:54:45.100]  experiences right because I'm pretty sure if I recall he had an intelligence
[03:54:45.100 --> 03:54:48.660]  background as well and a lot of people have pointed out the parallels between
[03:54:48.660 --> 03:54:53.140]  Tinker Taylor Soldier spy and you know the famous story of the fifth man of the
[03:54:53.140 --> 03:54:58.340]  Cambridge Espionage ring which a lot of people have pretty much maybe figured
[03:54:58.340 --> 03:55:02.660]  out who some of those fifth man or those moles other but there may be more than
[03:55:02.660 --> 03:55:05.980]  not just a fifth man but others as well it's kind of come out now people know
[03:55:05.980 --> 03:55:10.820]  who was probably involved in that so we see that there's always been this deep
[03:55:10.820 --> 03:55:16.660]  dark connection between the world of spying and the world of Hollywood
[03:55:16.660 --> 03:55:20.500]  celebrity status and the music industry there's no telling how many music acts
[03:55:20.500 --> 03:55:25.220]  you know I've been involved in this as well for example it famously came out
[03:55:25.220 --> 03:55:36.660]  that when it was is it Tesla right the winds of change that was organized by the
[03:55:36.660 --> 03:55:42.580]  CIA but for Tesla to go and play when the wall came down that was all a CIA
[03:55:42.580 --> 03:55:48.500]  operation utilizing a band for sort of global propaganda now as famous as
[03:55:48.500 --> 03:55:51.700]  a middle it's on the Guardian it's famous Guardian it's all over mainstream
[03:55:51.700 --> 03:55:55.460]  news now we've talked about that for many many years and then mainstream media
[03:55:55.460 --> 03:56:00.260]  covered it I think a year or two ago maybe three years ago and so now it's
[03:56:00.260 --> 03:56:03.340]  safe you could talk about it now that mainstream media has talked about it
[03:56:03.340 --> 03:56:06.380]  even though people in our sphere had talked about that for you know at least
[03:56:06.380 --> 03:56:11.460]  a decade or more and so you know this is the reality of what's going on in the
[03:56:11.460 --> 03:56:14.700]  world this is how the world really works you've got these power players in
[03:56:14.700 --> 03:56:19.660]  organized crime in intelligence agencies government you know high-power players
[03:56:19.660 --> 03:56:24.700]  that CEOs billionaires billionaires it's really more like a bond novel I guess
[03:56:24.700 --> 03:56:28.620]  you could say well we have these bond villains like you know a Klaus Schwab
[03:56:28.620 --> 03:56:33.900]  and whatnot then these compromisers who utilize you know people to
[03:56:33.900 --> 03:56:38.900]  compromise people like Jeff Stein McFrey if you remember that guy so you know
[03:56:38.900 --> 03:56:41.820]  here's the real world this is what's really going on I'm not saying everybody
[03:56:41.820 --> 03:56:45.380]  in Hollywood's a spy I'm not saying everybody I'm not making any outlandish
[03:56:45.380 --> 03:56:49.980]  outrageous claims just that the evidence that has come out proves in many of
[03:56:49.980 --> 03:56:55.780]  these cases that this is what's going on and that does give us a context to
[03:56:55.780 --> 03:57:01.140]  understand what might be going on with Kanye Brittany and don't forget the
[03:57:01.140 --> 03:57:06.140]  other stars who've had famous breakdowns right Amanda Bynes or Lindsay Lohan
[03:57:06.140 --> 03:57:12.340]  or you know on and on on the list goes on and on on at the celebrities if you
[03:57:12.340 --> 03:57:15.300]  want more on this I did write two books I have a sort of Hollywood one and two
