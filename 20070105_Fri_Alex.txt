[01:20.920 --> 01:26.400]  the closing out the week the final broadcast I'm doing in the first week

[01:39.440 --> 01:44.600]  time to squeeze in a few calls as well there's a really important article up
[01:44.600 --> 01:50.960]  on prisonplanet.com and I talked to Paul Watson about it when the
[01:50.960 --> 01:58.160]  story came out and I said Paul I didn't know about this there was a big bombing
[01:58.160 --> 02:04.200]  in Madrid Spain for some reason it's not my stack guys you print that for me
[02:04.200 --> 02:12.320]  again and I didn't even know and I'm somewhat of a news junkie scanning
[02:12.320 --> 02:17.760]  around the news wires and I called a few people in my family I talked to people
[02:17.760 --> 02:25.640]  here at the office none of them some of them are total news junkies addicts had
[02:25.640 --> 02:34.000]  heard of this I mean a giant bomb went off and wreaked incredible havoc but
[02:34.000 --> 02:40.880]  when they don't want to make a big deal out of it it's kept quiet so I'll get
[02:40.880 --> 02:47.420]  into that report a little bit later something else that's kept quiet is
[02:47.420 --> 02:54.440]  what's happening on the Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California borders with
[02:54.440 --> 03:03.720]  good ol' Mexico and that is that Mexican troops come across routinely and FBI
[03:03.720 --> 03:07.760]  agents have been killed have been wounded DEA have been killed and been
[03:07.760 --> 03:11.800]  wounded sheriff's deputies have been killed and wounded have been held up at
[03:11.800 --> 03:16.560]  gunpoint have been robbed Mexican troops have come across the border in Texas
[03:16.560 --> 03:19.240]  we've interviewed the sheriff who was there when it happened and pointed
[03:19.240 --> 03:25.280]  machine guns at him and took the marijuana back the Mexican troops take
[03:25.280 --> 03:30.120]  large payments from the illegal aliens and act as coyotes using their army
[03:30.120 --> 03:34.480]  trucks in many cases to drive across the border or to drive around border patrol
[03:34.480 --> 03:39.880]  to deliver them to US soil of course the AP reported yesterday the Mexican
[03:39.880 --> 03:43.600]  government in connection in conjunction with the US government since they're
[03:43.600 --> 03:49.960]  working together is going to pay in an opening program 200 for 200,000 GPS
[03:49.960 --> 03:54.040]  systems to navigate them into the US and let's say they're the cheapest GPS I
[03:54.040 --> 03:59.400]  ever heard of let's say 50 bucks a piece we're talking about tens of millions of
[03:59.400 --> 04:06.920]  dollars and of course there's the comic books that say this is Mexico and that
[04:06.920 --> 04:13.680]  the US belongs to Mexico come get it ozlan the mythical kingdom and it tells
[04:13.680 --> 04:18.360]  the in there don't beat your wife by the way the Americans get really mad at
[04:18.360 --> 04:23.560]  that how to stay under the radar how to sneak in what to do how to get on
[04:23.560 --> 04:30.120]  welfare so we have a country of a hundred million people literally attached
[04:30.120 --> 04:34.160]  to us pumping in 30 million of their population using us as a revolutionary
[04:34.160 --> 04:38.000]  steam valve because they would have no doubt a revolution down there probably
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.560]  with a good outcome certainly possibly with a good outcome if they hadn't used
[04:41.560 --> 04:48.800]  the US as a steam valve and you have tens of millions a year being sent back
[04:48.800 --> 04:52.760]  just from their paychecks not to mention the tens of millions being sent back
[04:52.760 --> 04:56.760]  that siphoned through all the welfare fraud there is no federal or state
[04:56.760 --> 05:01.080]  enforcement to stop fraud some of these people in cases when they have been
[05:01.080 --> 05:06.640]  caught have had seven different identities seven different identities
[05:06.640 --> 05:13.200]  pulling seven different welfare checks but but I'm gonna lay all this out
[05:13.200 --> 05:20.240]  and why the US Mexico pack revealed billions of non-citizens but but we
[05:20.240 --> 05:26.360]  mentioned that a few days ago no no it's it's it's happened again gunmen force

[07:42.600 --> 07:46.440]  in nineteen thirteen the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its
[07:46.440 --> 07:50.080]  own debt so why should you the hard-working American be harassed for
[07:50.080 --> 07:53.560]  yours there's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt

[08:51.240 --> 09:07.600]  GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[09:07.600 --> 09:13.720]  remember the reporter Ed Haas who we talked to about a month ago who had
[09:13.720 --> 09:18.160]  interviewed the Israeli-American who had reported to the FBI on record we
[09:18.160 --> 09:23.160]  confirmed this months before 9-11 to hear people in Hebrew talking about when
[09:23.160 --> 09:27.640]  the towers get knocked down in September the Americans will know what
[09:27.640 --> 09:32.600]  it's like to be hit by terrorist and it's on record he went to the FBI well
[09:32.600 --> 09:37.200]  now more of this story has been confirmed I've had a chance to learn the
[09:37.200 --> 09:41.040]  name and get the number of the individual actually a few weeks go up and so busy I
[09:41.040 --> 09:46.200]  haven't been able to follow up on it and get a hold of the times I called but the
[09:46.200 --> 09:51.800]  individual now has signed more statements to the FBI and so we'll give you an
[09:51.800 --> 09:56.800]  update on that about 22 minutes from now then we've got Webster Tarpley coming
[09:56.800 --> 09:59.640]  on at the bottom of the next hour to talk about Gerald Ford and the Bush
[09:59.640 --> 10:03.680]  connection and then some of the current things that are happening and then Tony
[10:03.680 --> 10:09.360]  Gosling who is one of the premium experts on the Bilderberg group in the
[10:09.360 --> 10:14.600]  world runs the big builder bird org website he'll be joining us coming up
[10:14.600 --> 10:18.560]  to talk about the global elite what their programs are in the third hour
[10:18.560 --> 10:29.920]  today so that's the guess that we have joining us in the meantime
[10:31.360 --> 10:35.720]  forgive me I'm a bit slow today I'm still a little bit under the weather
[10:35.720 --> 10:44.680]  as you may hear me pause from time to time to shelter you from the hacking and
[10:44.680 --> 10:57.680]  snarling that's going on now we're also going to be getting into the fact that
[10:57.680 --> 11:03.840]  terror is trivial when it's not Muslims Madrid Airport bombing receives scant
[11:03.840 --> 11:09.080]  attention and this happened over the last weekend but still the average
[11:09.080 --> 11:16.920]  person hasn't heard about it so we'll be discussing that a little bit later in
[11:16.920 --> 11:22.880]  the summer but it happened again it's happened a whole bunch of times and it
[11:22.880 --> 11:31.760]  never gets the attention it deserves can you imagine if Arabs shot at border
[11:31.760 --> 11:38.960]  patrol or if Arabs or Muslims shot at National Guard and overran them the type
[11:38.960 --> 11:45.800]  of hysteria the type of freaking out I mean hide your children lock your doors
[11:45.800 --> 11:51.320]  people would build shrines to SWAT teams with little men in black masks that they
[11:51.320 --> 11:55.760]  would bow down to it it's basically already gotten to that but you know
[11:55.760 --> 11:58.760]  little sat little sacrifices to it I mean I mean that's what the point we're
[11:58.760 --> 12:03.000]  getting to where we worship our slavery where we worship the paramilitary
[12:03.000 --> 12:11.000]  forces that rule over us with hate but can you imagine there were 50 was it
[12:11.000 --> 12:19.080]  four yeah 54 back in 2005 American citizens late 2005 kidnapped over the
[12:19.080 --> 12:24.440]  Texas border and taken down to Mexico and held and it was kept very quiet when
[12:24.440 --> 12:31.080]  there was a huge week long standoff and in you know armed takeover and some of
[12:31.080 --> 12:36.800]  the people got killed 800 plus dead on the Texas and Mexico sides of the border
[12:36.800 --> 12:42.360]  in 2005 it was hundreds and hundreds last year the State Department reported
[12:42.360 --> 12:47.480]  that it was more dangerous than the West Bank of Israel its highest threat level
[12:47.480 --> 12:56.320]  warning of not to travel into those areas of South Texas there are over a
[12:56.320 --> 13:04.240]  million illegal aliens conservatively in Houston alone there have been car bombs
[13:04.240 --> 13:09.720]  there machine gunnings there a car bombing in Dallas shootings in Austin
[13:09.720 --> 13:17.960]  San Antonio and I mean imagine trucks blow up and then catch the house you know
[13:17.960 --> 13:23.000]  on fire next to them and blow people up in them and it's just minor footnote on
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.200]  the Dallas morning news minor or footnote on the on the nightly news you
[13:27.200 --> 13:34.720]  see they know what to hype they know what to not hide and we had a bunch of
[13:34.720 --> 13:38.600]  border patrol killed and shot and then always they say somebody shot them from
[13:38.600 --> 13:42.160]  over the border and then always a few weeks later okay it was Mexican troops
[13:42.160 --> 13:48.840]  but they were roads and they were work they've been hired by the drug dealers
[13:48.840 --> 13:53.720]  does that mean hired by the generals because it's everyone knows it's on
[13:53.720 --> 13:58.440]  record that every Mexican general is publicly a narcotics trafficker the
[13:58.440 --> 14:03.240]  whole government runs the narcotics and they sell them through certified drug
[14:03.240 --> 14:08.640]  carriers and conduits to u.s. drug dealers here in the continental you know
[14:08.640 --> 14:11.080]  u.s.
[14:11.080 --> 14:14.680]  me all the time I said the government ships in the drugs and people go well
[14:14.680 --> 14:19.960]  I I got a cousin that's drug dealer he ain't working for the government we're
[14:19.960 --> 14:24.520]  not talking about your small-time dope dealers I know they drive a Cadillac and
[14:24.520 --> 14:29.680]  live in a million dollar house they're absolutely nothing okay the real banks
[14:29.680 --> 14:34.680]  that wander the money get over 300 billion a year here in the u.s. alone the
[14:34.680 --> 14:42.480]  major conduits take Columbia you will have GPS on the crop spraying aircraft
[14:42.480 --> 14:47.920]  and they will spray certain fields right next to other cocoa fields or
[14:47.920 --> 14:52.160]  marijuana fields or opium plantations and they will not spray the one right
[14:52.160 --> 14:59.600]  next to it it's all are you paying your cut okay so large portions are
[14:59.600 --> 15:06.480]  directly shipped in on u.s. government aircraft trains and ships then large u.s.
[15:06.480 --> 15:11.240]  corporations also ship in large shipments and they're totally totally protected
[15:11.240 --> 15:16.920]  but then the lion's share of it is coming in through carriers and through
[15:16.920 --> 15:24.600]  other shipments by licensed drug cartels and we've had Celica still oh former
[15:24.600 --> 15:29.880]  head de agent latin america he'd also been a marine corps excuse me an army sniper
[15:29.880 --> 15:34.680]  he'd been a police officer he'd been a border patrol guard and then moved up into
[15:34.680 --> 15:40.360]  dea so worked at all saying that Los Zetas the so-called paramilitary you
[15:40.360 --> 15:44.320]  know mexican army drug dealers all over the southwest killing whoever they want
[15:44.320 --> 15:48.560]  including police by the way but again it's bad when you kill a cop except when
[15:48.560 --> 15:55.240]  Los Zetas does it it's kept very quiet it's like a cop union just shut up okay
[15:55.240 --> 15:59.080]  this is the special group you keep your mouth shut you want Los Zetas to come
[15:59.080 --> 16:03.440]  get you and they tried to hire sellies you know they train right down there in
[16:03.440 --> 16:09.640]  South Texas and its former CIA commandos still CIA down there running the whole
[16:09.640 --> 16:15.080]  lob in fact selly told us three years ago that came out the news last year two
[16:15.080 --> 16:19.560]  years after he reported it that they were hiring all the former death squad
[16:19.560 --> 16:24.920]  commanders from Nicaragua El Salvador Panama Guatemala thousands of them to
[16:24.920 --> 16:29.760]  run the death camps of the extermination squads in Iraq and lo and behold it has
[16:29.760 --> 16:34.240]  now been in the Associated Press it's been in the big papers out of caracas it
[16:34.240 --> 16:41.680]  is admitted and now the Boston Globe reports as well as the Associated Press
[16:41.680 --> 16:45.600]  that they are have huge recruiting stations all over Latin America and
[16:45.600 --> 16:51.880]  that the large portion of our troops are now foreigners oh they're there they're
[16:51.880 --> 16:57.040]  breeding and training and preparing hardcore Latin America death squads right
[16:57.040 --> 17:01.120]  here in the US in fact if the globalists ever decide to kill me that's
[17:01.120 --> 17:05.640]  probably who they'll hire to do it they don't care they're complained the cops
[17:05.640 --> 17:09.560]  will lick their boots they can kill whatever many cops they want these
[17:09.560 --> 17:14.080]  little cowardly creatures just love it they want to pull over all ladies and
[17:14.080 --> 17:17.600]  shake them down they don't want to they want to take their body armor off here
[17:17.600 --> 17:21.440]  shoot me Mexican drips because they love to cower and listen to Rush Limbaugh
[17:21.440 --> 17:26.320]  they love fake conservatism and weakness and lies in the destruction of this
[17:26.320 --> 17:33.040]  country all right I've been a little mean I just want to illustrate how
[17:33.040 --> 17:38.160]  ridiculous all this is cameras and school bathrooms checkpoints all over the
[17:38.160 --> 17:42.040]  country the Bush has announced he's reading all our mail we already knew
[17:42.040 --> 17:46.720]  this folks they open mail all the time most of stuff comes my house has been
[17:46.720 --> 17:51.800]  opened I mean what do you expect living in the Banana Republic run by a bunch of
[17:51.800 --> 18:02.080]  gangsters and I shouldn't go off about the police it's just so many of them
[18:02.080 --> 18:07.320]  been killed I mean some drug dealer or some old lady shoots a cop man they
[18:07.320 --> 18:11.760]  act like Jesus died but whenever the Mexican trips kill him it's kept real
[18:11.760 --> 18:15.280]  quiet and those cops are told sticky thumbs in your mouth and suck on them
[18:15.280 --> 18:25.320]  and shut up and they say yes a boss yes it's just pathetic it's pathetic but
[18:25.320 --> 18:29.360]  all right I'm already burning out all our time I need to go over what's
[18:29.360 --> 18:35.840]  happened US Mexico packed revealed billions to go to non-citizens that's
[18:35.840 --> 18:41.400]  that's that's coming up actually secondarily this out of the AP gunman
[18:41.400 --> 18:46.040]  force guard troops to flee Border Patrol post National Guard troops at
[18:46.040 --> 18:50.960]  non-observation post in the Mexico border were forced to flee a group of
[18:50.960 --> 18:55.440]  armed people and we've got sources there in Arizona and it's the same MO it's
[18:55.440 --> 18:59.800]  Mexican drug troops that control that area and the reports are it's Mexican
[18:59.800 --> 19:04.440]  troops again we've had a sheriff on from South Texas who's had the Mexican troops
[19:04.440 --> 19:07.720]  pull right up ain't guns at them and take the marijuana away they just seized
[19:07.720 --> 19:12.960]  three miles over the border you're not taking our shipment buddy and what it
[19:12.960 --> 19:17.720]  are what it are but what the sheriff is Japanese too I couldn't help myself I
[19:17.720 --> 19:21.640]  mean I would just take cover and open fire on them but again I don't know I
[19:21.640 --> 19:26.240]  maybe and that's not even macho with me I mean you got firing troops in your
[19:26.240 --> 19:31.280]  country your instinct should be to kill them if they're aiming guns at you and
[19:31.280 --> 19:37.640]  shooting at you but no not Americans man we've been trained to lay down I was
[19:37.640 --> 19:40.760]  just on a national talk show right before I came on into this this this this
[19:40.760 --> 19:45.360]  live hour and I brought this up and they said well we got to be nice well I was
[19:45.360 --> 19:48.680]  talking to one of the producers off air actually they're like well you got to be
[19:48.680 --> 19:56.840]  nice to come to the illegal aliens gunman force guard troops to flee Border
[19:56.840 --> 20:02.720]  Patrol post and you really can't knock the guard because they're not allowed to
[20:02.720 --> 20:11.720]  have loaded weapons that's right can't have loaded weapons so one place you
[20:11.720 --> 20:16.240]  can have troops constitutionally is the border but no no no no we're gonna have
[20:16.240 --> 20:21.560]  our national guard in New Orleans taking little old ladies guns and shooting
[20:21.560 --> 20:27.680]  American citizens but you the troops who are not allowed to apprehend illegal
[20:27.680 --> 20:31.720]  mortar crossers withdrew safely and no one was injured so National Guard
[20:31.720 --> 20:38.560]  Sergeant Edward Balban okay black working purification elements are more
[20:38.560 --> 20:42.440]  powerful than any gravity filter element on the market these awesome
[20:42.440 --> 20:46.400]  elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to
[20:46.400 --> 20:50.960]  upgrade most other gravity filtration systems they can purify raw untreated
[20:50.960 --> 20:55.680]  water by removing pathogenic bacteria cysts parasites trihalomethane and
[20:55.680 --> 21:00.800]  chemicals such as chlorine atrazine styrene and MTBE these elements also
[21:00.800 --> 21:05.920]  reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead mercury and aluminum unbelievably they
[21:05.920 --> 21:10.280]  even remove small micro particulate from water like food coloring particles yet
[21:10.280 --> 21:14.080]  they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs moreover because
[21:14.080 --> 21:17.680]  they are recleanable black Berkey elements are more economical than the

[24:25.960 --> 24:34.320]  that's www.LaysMedInc.com
[24:47.440 --> 24:55.320]  the way this works is the media tells us when to get upset huge bomb goes off
[24:55.320 --> 24:58.440]  at the airport in Madrid they don't want the public to know about it so it's
[24:58.440 --> 25:06.240]  buried in some newswire and no one learns of it for four or five days oh yeah
[25:06.240 --> 25:10.760]  that's how this operates so we have total bad women on the border we have the
[25:10.760 --> 25:15.320]  Mexican radio stations all announcing this is Mexico six hundred to something
[25:15.320 --> 25:21.400]  billboards saying LA's Mexico ha ha ha federal government finances the whole
[25:21.400 --> 25:27.760]  thing every few months Mexican troops open fire wound or shoot up the vehicles
[25:27.760 --> 25:34.840]  aboard a patrol it never makes national news and this is this is just this is
[25:34.840 --> 25:41.920]  this is how it operates now up on prisonpana.com and informers.com we
[25:41.920 --> 25:51.280]  have the actual local newspaper articles that have more details of what
[25:51.280 --> 25:58.240]  happened than what the AP reports but all that my bottom dollar that these are
[25:58.240 --> 26:02.040]  Mexican troops because Mexican troops don't let anybody else operate down
[26:02.040 --> 26:07.320]  there you pay them the money they bring you across now you'll have a coyote who's
[26:07.320 --> 26:12.400]  going who's leading them but but he is shepherded to the border or across the
[26:12.400 --> 26:16.920]  border and then it's his job that to get you to a safe house or to the vans that
[26:16.920 --> 26:23.040]  pick you up on the highway and the border patrol reports they catch about one
[26:23.040 --> 26:31.560]  out of ten that come across so if you go read the AP article government force
[26:31.560 --> 26:37.440]  guard troops to flee border patrol post national guard troops an observation
[26:37.440 --> 26:42.200]  post near the Mexican border were forced to flee a group of armed people who
[26:42.200 --> 26:46.520]  later ran into Mexico authorities said the troops who were not allowed to
[26:46.520 --> 26:50.360]  apprehend illegal border crossers withdrew safely and no one was injured
[26:50.360 --> 26:56.800]  said National Guard Sergeant Edward Balaban what can you imagine if our
[26:56.800 --> 26:59.480]  troops were going across the Mexican border shooting at their people and
[26:59.480 --> 27:05.080]  telling their people I mean the Mexico would just go into a complete cardiac
[27:05.080 --> 27:11.640]  arrest as a US citizen you try sneaking across the border down there boy
[27:11.640 --> 27:15.360]  they'll put you in prison and suck every dime out of your family and it'll be
[27:15.360 --> 27:23.160]  called good bar media the US border patrol officials are investigating run by
[27:23.160 --> 27:29.640]  Chertoff who's even American don't you love America where foreigners are our
[27:29.640 --> 27:34.000]  little Nazi viceroys like Chertoff US border patrol officials are
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.920]  investigating the 11 p.m. Wednesday incident and are trying to determine who
[27:38.920 --> 27:45.080]  the armed people were and why they approached the post near Saseby in the
[27:45.080 --> 27:54.040]  desert corridor between Nogales and Lukeville Balaban of the sergeant said
[27:54.040 --> 27:59.120]  the troops didn't know how many people were involved because it was so dark the
[27:59.120 --> 28:03.560]  area has been the busiest in the Tucson sector for marijuana seizures agents
[28:03.560 --> 28:09.080]  who seized 124,000 pounds of marijuana what we need to add to an article we're
[28:09.080 --> 28:12.280]  writing about this is that it first started four years ago remember the
[28:12.280 --> 28:19.920]  bounties on border patrol and then my dad whose patient was then the head of the
[28:19.920 --> 28:25.480]  Texas border patrol no longer is said is that true and he said oh yeah that's
[28:25.480 --> 28:29.480]  true and he made the joke you know it's like $200,000 bounty that's a lot more
[28:29.480 --> 28:34.080]  than we're worth and like it's funny you know I guess he was just making a joke
[28:34.080 --> 28:39.760]  about it because it's uncomfortable and then people tried to deny that and then
[28:39.760 --> 28:43.800]  they took out ads in Mexican newspapers saying there's bounties on people's
[28:43.800 --> 28:52.280]  heads what was it one of them was a $20,000 bounty for any dead border patrol
[28:52.280 --> 28:58.920]  yeah that's real neighborly and the papers take ads imagine imagine us
[28:58.920 --> 29:07.360]  newspapers imagine the Brownsville paper or the or the Kingsville paper in
[29:07.360 --> 29:17.320]  South Texas taking an ad hey $20,000 to kill Mexican border patrol I mean that's
[29:17.320 --> 29:24.680]  how institutionalized hate of the US and kill the Yankees down there and I'm
[29:24.680 --> 29:33.000]  sick of it and I don't want dumb twint state police pulling me over on the
[29:33.000 --> 29:36.600]  side of the highway and wanting to search my vehicle that's why I get mad at
[29:36.600 --> 29:42.080]  you idiots we're getting killed and kidnapped and car bombs are going off
[29:42.080 --> 29:48.240]  and you idiots and I mean you the whole government well the people that work
[29:48.240 --> 29:52.360]  for the government are a pack of morons I shouldn't I'm just so mad I know most

[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:40.440]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:50.440]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:59.440]  We've got Tony Gosling who's got the website Builderberg.org. He's been running it for many years. It's really the definitive site on it.
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:03.440]  I'm making a film about Builderberg Group.
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:09.440]  Well, more than just Builderberg, the global masters right now.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:21.440]  We'll be picking his brain about Diana, about Prince Charles, about the New World Order system coming up the next hour in about 25 minutes.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:24.440]  We've got a short half-hour interview with Webster Griffin Tartley coming up with a world overview in 2007.
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:33.440]  Also, the coup d'etat at the Bush Crime Syndicate ran when they overthrew Nixon in 1974 and brought in the late Gerald Ford.
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:39.440]  That's coming up. We've got a short interview here with Marty from Calvin Soap here in just a second.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:48.440]  Then I'll get into the big bombings both in Asia and, of course, in Europe in the last week.
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:54.440]  We heard some about the stuff in Thailand, but almost nothing about what happened in Madrid last Saturday.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:10:03.440]  That's coming up. Right now, Marty from Calvin Soap joins us. I first want to say this before we bring Marty up.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:09.440]  I turn down advertisers every single day. We get tons of advertising requests here.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:19.440]  For all I know, some machine that sends out some wavelength that's going to heal you might work, but if I can't prove it works, I don't know if somebody has worked on it.
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:30.440]  I'm not going to endorse it. For all I know, some cream might get rid of wrinkles. For all I know, some pill might get rid of problems.
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:37.440]  But if I don't know it works, and if I don't know it's a good deal, I mean, take fish oil. We've got to link to people that sell fish oil.
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:41.440]  I know fish oil is really good for you, so I promote it.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:51.440]  I mean, really, I'm into simple things. High quality, made to miracle water filters, documentary films. I promote things that I know are real.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:58.440]  And I'm not saying other stuff. Other people push isn't real. I'm just not going to sit here and endorse it.
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:04.440]  Most of you already know the story, but I want to tell it again.
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:18.440]  About two and a half years ago, there was a sponsor on the Genesis Network, Calvin Pierce soap, and somehow Marty had heard that I had the biggest show on the network, so he sent me a year's supply of soap.
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:26.440]  Then the stuff ran out in about a year and a half, and my wife said, I want more of that. I don't have the box anymore. Get me more.
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:34.440]  And I said, she said, where do I buy it? And I said, all the networks, you like it? And she said, oh, yeah, I've been using it for shampoo. I've been using the bar soap.
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:42.440]  You know, that bar soap smells so good. I've been using it on the clothes. We've got to be real careful, or the kids will break out if we use chemical detergents.
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:52.440]  So we ordered some more. And then I just thought, you know, this stuff's so good, and it's so cheap, I ought to call them up and say, why don't you sponsor the show?
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:12:01.440]  So I did, and Marty said, yeah, that's why I sent you this up. I thought you'd like it. And sure enough, you know, two years later, he ended up being a sponsor.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:16.440]  And folks, you save 85% off supermarket prices because it's triple concentrated, and you don't pay a middle man. You're getting it factory direct from the family that for 60 years, 60 years.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:29.440]  His father started it. He runs it. His son runs it. Marty does an excellent job, and they've got a little simpler pack of basically some of their top products for $16 a month supply.
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:42.440]  They've got year supplies, two year supplies, three year supplies. I had seen their soap one time before when I was in a higher end hotel in DC about many years ago on a trip with my parents.
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:52.440]  And I've since seen it a few other places. Before he started selling it, I don't know, five, six years ago to the general public, you only saw it in high end hotels and in hospitals because they're not stupid.
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:13:00.440]  They know what a good deal is. They like to buy factory direct, and they want something that won't cause their customers problems.
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:13.440]  So it's made America. It supports freedom in this show. It saves you 85% off. The toxic stuff that's made by the chemical companies, most of it's petrochemical derived, is very bad for your skin, bad for your clothes, and it's expensive.
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:24.440]  And you're totally insane if you don't use CalBimp your soap. Now, we still buy some other organic materials. Frankly, it's because we're busy and we end up not getting on the phone and ordering the product when we run out of it.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:41.440]  We're all like that. And we go to Whole Foods or we go to the other big organic stores here in Austin. We're blessed to have those. Central Market and other organic soaps that aren't as good will be twice as much as inorganic trash at the supermarket.
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:53.440]  And then this stuff is 15% the cost of that, of just the regular stuff. So for those that already use organics, they've been organic since they were founded.
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:14:02.440]  Marty, thanks for coming on with us. Tell us about the founding of the company. I want to hear about that today and then give folks a toll free number or the website.
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:14.440]  Well, Alex, I appreciate you inviting me again to talk to you and your audience. Basically, the whole concept of what we've done is two words and that's called choice and value.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:26.440]  And when I got out of the Army, I was in Japan for a year in 1947. My father retired from civil service and we were looking around what we could do together.
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:37.440]  And we went to the supermarkets and looking at all the chemicals and detergents and we noticed soap was not available anymore. Everything converted over to detergents.
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:46.440]  And we thought, hey, wouldn't this be something we started the soap business? But we had no way of getting to the consumer. It was all tied up by Proctor, Lever and Colgate.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:58.440]  So we decided to go commercial. We sold hospitals and schools and convalescent homes, retirement centers. This is what we could get to a purchasing agent.
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:11.440]  We could demo and sample and we could get sales. And it was only about, I'd say, three years ago that we got a call from Michael Prado of Genesis Communications Network
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:22.440]  and he invited us to be on the radio. And he says, gee, what? It never occurred to us that we could do that to talk direct to the consumer from our factory to the family.
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:33.440]  And that basically gave us the concept of four basic products, bath soap, air soap, dish soap and laundry soap. And there are 200 jobs.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:40.440]  You don't need the window cleaners and the floor cleaners and the old purpose cleaners and the chemicals and the solvents.
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:48.440]  And I've got to tell you about the newest thing in chemicals. I just got my newest copy of consumer reports and I'm going to quote you from them.
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:55.440]  Oh, I got my copy too about how the child seats are so dangerous. Only two brands actually save kids. But sorry, side issue. Go ahead.
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:16:05.440]  Now, page 43 of the newest issue talks about laundry detergents. Now, this is a blessing that they're giving the American public for the new year.
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:11.440]  And it says the chemicals and laundry detergents that clean clothing are called surfactants.
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:32.440]  But in the case of at least one type, surfactant is also a dirty word. Non-phenyl ethyl oxalate, also known as NPE, are recognized by the EPA as toxic to plants and animals and damage to the aquatic ecosystem.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:42.440]  They're also banned in parts of the European Union. But some detergents made in the U.S. contain these chemicals because they cost less.
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:47.440]  Another bonus for the consumer of a toxic chemical in laundry detergents.
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:55.440]  Well, Marty, also the detergents you use to wash clothes, eat your clothes. You won't even need that lint bend anymore when you start using cow bend pure soap.
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:17:07.440]  And you don't have animal fat in your stuff. It's all organic. And you've got oils out of different nuts, out of different citrus, out of vegetables.
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:17.440]  This is super high quality. And because there's not all the middlemen and the billions of dollars of advertising like Procter & Gamble, you save 85% off supermarket costs.
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:29.440]  Folks, you need to give Marty a call right now. Get a free catalog or get the $16 sampler pack. It is so important for everybody out there to give Marty a call right now.
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:48.440]  1-800-340-7091 or cow bend pure soap dot com or five star soap dot com or link through via info wars. On info wars, we have a big banner on the left hand side.

[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:08.440]  Or you can go to cow bend pure soap dot com or five star soap dot com.
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:12.440]  Marty, any other reasons people should get your soap?
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:22.440]  1. It's factory direct. 2. They're pure soaps, not deterges, but soaps from the olden 18, 19th and 20th century.
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:30.440]  They do a better job. You have longevity of your clothing. Your skin will feel alive again. Your hair will be refreshed again.
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:39.440]  Your dishes and washing them by hand. You don't have to wear gloves because it doesn't hurt, harm. It's all natural. It's pollution free.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:51.440]  And we've been doing this. And this is our year, the 60th year of getting soap back into the home again and saying to Park Deliver and Colgate, I don't need you anymore.
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:56.440]  That's right. You guys started in 1947. So you're now celebrating your 60th year.
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:01.440]  And our slogan here is our business is going down the drain.
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:10.440]  All right, Marty, Calvin pure soap dot com or five star soap dot com or 1-800-340-7091. Thanks for coming on, Marty. And we'll talk to you again.
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:20.440]  I'd like to leave a thought for today. The thought for today is six on television is not harmful unless you fall off.
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:24.440]  Take care, my friend. Thank you, Alex.
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:30.440]  All right. Good to talk to Marty. What a character. And we like to bring good products and he comes on with us once a month. So there's his visit.
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:34.440]  And we believe in it. It'll save you money. It'll save your skin.
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:42.440]  I tell you, folks, if I use just regular soap on my face, you know, dry or crackly, it doesn't with this.
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:47.440]  So give Marty a call, folks. All right, we'll get back. I'm going to get into the big Madrid bombing.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:50.440]  And no, I'm not talking about the one on 311.
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:20:04.440]  I'm talking about the Madrid bombing of last weekend that no one seems to know about. I mean, I am ashamed of the fact that I didn't know about this and everybody I knew didn't know about this.
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:12.440]  And it's just an illustration, just like really no one's going to hear about the Mexican troops attacking on a routine basis.
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:21.440]  The media is there to scare you about things that don't exist or very small threats than to cover up real threats.
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:26.440]  And to always tell you that they're going to be your savior, that they've got all the answers.
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:32.440]  We'll be right back. Webster Tart was coming up, too. We'll also take calls later. And we're going to Goldberg Group in the third hour.

[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:45.440]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:50.440]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S. dollar can be devalued.
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:55.440]  We have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:23:03.440]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.

[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:53.440]  Welcome back. Hi, this is a story up on presidentlinah.com yesterday. Terror is trivial when it's not Muslims.
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:57.440]  Madrid Airport bombing received scant attention by Paul Watson.
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:02.440]  How many people who aren't news junkies know that Madrid Airport was bombed on Saturday?
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:05.440]  Folks, I didn't know until I saw the story yesterday afternoon.
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:16.440]  Relatively few, I would venture, and that's because major Western governments and their media mouthpieces don't hype terror unless they can claim Muslims are behind it.
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:24.440]  I personally only caught the story a couple of days after it happened on the obscure channel on UK digital satellite called EuroNews.
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:38.440]  Operatives of the Basque Separatist Organization, ETA, packed 800 kilograms of explosives into a car bomb that ripped apart the parking lot of the Madrid Airport, killing two and injuring 20 people.
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:42.440]  I mean, it blew out a whole bunch. I'm looking at like three floors completely blown away.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:54.440]  Now imagine if Al Qaeda or LCI ETA bombed Heathrow or LAX, you'd never hear the end of it. Oh, they'd have a yearly remembrance and it'd be just a cover of everything.
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:26:01.440]  There'd be flags at half mass, children crying. Now imagine if LCI ETA bombed Heathrow or LAX, you'd never hear the end of it.
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:06.440]  The news would be on at 24-7 and entering an airport would be akin to checking into a concentration camp.
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:12.440]  And yet Saturday's blast is greeted by little more than by-lines and muted dismissals by the mainstream media.
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:19.440]  And that's because it's probably real. The Basque are blowing stuff up constantly. It's their war.
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:25.440]  You know, you can argue it's how they militarily fight back because their region's always being dominated. I'm not defending it.
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:32.440]  My point is that when you have real terrorism, governments keep it very quiet because you don't want to give terrorist attention.
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:42.440]  That empowers them to do more of it. Only if you are the terrorist or you're using what they did for control against another target do you hype it.
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:50.440]  That was in the anti-terror handbooks 10, 20 years ago. I've read them. How do you deal with terrorism? You ignore it. You don't give it attention.
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:57.440]  You don't let their fear spread. But if your government are the terrorists or hired terrorists, you get the opposite.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:07.440]  Before 9-11, terrorism was seen through the prism of criminal problems because fewer people lose their lives as a result of that than those who get struck by lightning.
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:12.440]  We have another article out today about how peanuts kill more every year in the U.S. than terrorism.
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:15.440]  But see now they're changing the definition of terrorism to all crime.
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:21.440]  There have been just 2,929 terror-induced deaths since 9-11.
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:30.440]  According to the Bush administration's own numbers and more people every year die in swimming pool accidents, hardly the mega threat to western society that many have portrayed.
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:45.440]  Put it in context, Saturday's bombing would not have made the top of the news because like all terrorism that occurs in the West, it is extremely rare random, like murder, rape or theft, is impossible to ever truly prevent.
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:28:00.440]  But in the post-9-11 world, the artificial creation and maintenance of the myth of Islamophagism is dependent on ceaseless obsession with the imminent threat of Muslim terror while leaving the border open to bring in record numbers of them.
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:04.440]  I would add that. It's such a big threat while you bring in record numbers.
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:15.440]  And it goes on. And that's why something like the Madrid airport bombing would have been shoved down the throats until Kingdom come, but only if Muslims weren't behind it.
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:25.440]  Terror attacks like Saturday's become mere precursors to the, and finally, puff piece if they can't be pinned on Islamophagists in the scam recycle.
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:48.440]  It's almost a national emergency nowadays if Muslims, God forbid, are seeing praying on an airplane. And there every action is being scrutinized as a foreboding for the apocalypse, which only breeds suspicion across all of society and has turned the land of the free, the United States, into the land of hysteria.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:56.440]  Swimming pools killed more Americans than terrorists today, Muslim or otherwise. Fear is a lie.
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:01.440]  Good story by Paul Watson upon PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:07.440]  And it's the same thing with the open borders and the crime spree and the rocket attacks and the car bombs.
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:13.440]  In Texas, it's kept quiet and you tell the average cop, I've talked to cops.
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:20.440]  Hey, you heard all the problems on the border. Have you heard about the rocket attacks? Huh? Rocket attack. I've even asked police out on the street. What are you talking about?
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:29.440]  And the citizens certainly don't know anything about it. But oh my gosh, Al-Qaeda is everywhere. They're going to get us. We better let Bush read our mail.
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:37.440]  We better let them track all our cell phones. We better have FBI and CIA over all these fusion centers, these emergency management centers.
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:54.440]  Every bureaucrat and every citizen better act like Jack Bauer and look under every table. And there's long, fanged Al-Qaeda members under every table in every closet, under every bed, ready to bite you as soon as you turn away.
[01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:57.440]  Just amazing.
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:01.440]  And then they found 220 pounds of explosives in Spain.
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:09.440]  Bunch of other reports. Amazing. Absolutely amazing.
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:17.440]  Alright, we'll come back with Webster, Griffin Tarnley. They get his update and his view on 2007 coming up.
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:22.440]  And we'll talk about Gerald Ford and George Herbert Walker.
[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:26.440]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:32.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:37.440]  I found this company online and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:41.440]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:45.440]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:51.440]  I was so amazed. I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect night light. Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:57.440]  Solay Wellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:03.440]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan Salt.
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:08.440]  I figured it would clean really well. The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:14.440]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with. Plus, the service was great.
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:21.440]  If you're interested in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies, visit Solay Wellness.com.
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:32.440]  That's S-O-L-A-Y Wellness.com or call 312-224-2710. 312-224-2710.
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:39.440]  The statistics aren't heart-wrenching. According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:45.440]  from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive. Most likely, each one of us can say
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:49.440]  we either knew someone who served or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:55.440]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who spend their lives protecting our freedom
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:32:01.440]  and to those who have lost their lives doing so. Davis Products is offering high-quality, solid-cast aluminum memorial markers
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:07.440]  for your American flag. Each memorial marker is specifically designed to represent one of 15 wars.
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:14.440]  All markers include a 3-8-inch pointed and threaded aluminum rod painted and highlighted for an appearance that is unforgettable.
[01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:20.440]  What better way to pay homage to our enlisted loved ones? Davis Products memorial markers are only $9 a piece
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:32.440]  and can be ordered by calling 814-827-4946. That's 814-827-4946. Or visit davis-products.com. That's davis-products.com.
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:40.440]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out. For over 5 years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:44.440]  Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:50.440]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore. This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:56.440]  covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we think. When we do our program, you know, in herbal form it's like Cardivite
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:33:02.440]  is someone who could barely walk up a hill. Now, going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:09.440]  It's a well-thought-out formula. I mean, the idea of working on yeast and metals both at the same time in liver function is dead on.
[01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:16.440]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems. It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:26.440]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:32.440]  That toll free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:55.440]  I hurt myself today to see if I still feel.
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:06.440]  I focus on the thing, the only thing that's real.
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:16.440]  The needle tears the hole, the old familiar stain.
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:28.440]  Try to kill it all away, but I remember everything.
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:49.440]  What have I become? My sweetest friend, everyone I know goes away in the air.
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:35:03.440]  And you could have it all. My empire of dirt, I will let you down.
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:08.440]  Welcome back. I will make you.
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:13.440]  Glad you joined us. We're about to go to Webster Tarbley, first interview with him of the new year.
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:19.440]  Before we do that, if you believe in this broadcast and what we're doing, you need to support us.
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:25.440]  And you do that, number one, by getting my documentary films and the other books and videos I carry by other authors,
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:32.440]  like Webster Drift and Tarbley's newest edition of 9-11 Synthetic Terror made in the USA that we carry.
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:38.440]  Then you support us, you get a great book, get informed, or have a great gift to give somebody and you support Webster.
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:44.440]  We got a bunch of books, a bunch of videos, 9-11 Mysteries Demolitions, Loose Change Second Edition,
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:49.440]  my new film Terror Storm with 68 Minutes of Extras, like Webster Tarbley speaking in LA.
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:58.440]  We've got America Freedom to Fascism. You can get Terror Storm as low as $9.95 when you get it with other videos.
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:04.440]  We combo them up together. You can get some of my films as low as $5.95 apiece.
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:08.440]  T-shirts as low as $9.95 apiece.
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:15.440]  I mean, we are putting our material out at the lowest possible price because our goal is,
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:20.440]  frankly, when we discounted everything about six months ago, it didn't increase sales. I don't care.
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:26.440]  We did it so you can get more of these materials to get them out to people. That's the goal.
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:30.440]  Take my new police state trilogy. My first seven films never had time to get them on DVD.
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:34.440]  They're now all on DVD. America Destroyed by Design.
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:39.440]  We've got The Masters of Terror, Matrix of Evil, Police State 2000, Police State II the Takeover,
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:44.440]  Police State III Total Enslavement. Those three are together in the police state trilogy
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:50.440]  in one DVD package, three separate DVDs, $34.95. That's 45% off.
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:55.440]  You cannot beat that deal. Infowars.com, Peruse the Safe, Secure Online,
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:01.440]  Video and Bookstore Shopping Card. Get as many books and videos as you can.
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:08.440]  Make copies of my films. Get them out to people. The power of you, the listeners, taking action is unstoppable.
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:13.440]  The ball is in your court, ladies and gentlemen. I mean, I hate to describe this as a pathogen,
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:17.440]  but we are against the New World Order.
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:23.440]  Literally, I guess I'm the first virus to come into the body, but if you don't help us replicate, it has no effect.
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:29.440]  Well, let's turn that around. Let's say the New World Order is a disease and we are white blood cell programmers,
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:34.440]  or T lymphocytes. You know, there might be one for 100,000 regular white blood cells,
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:39.440]  and then I'm kind of like a T lymphocyte. I go out and I tell people what to attack,
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:43.440]  or I try to get you to focus in on an enemy pathogen.
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:47.440]  So we need you to act like white blood cells out there. Take my free podcast,

[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:46.440]  Get active. Get aggressive. But again, go to infowars.com and get the films.
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:56.440]  Recall till 3-1-8-8-8-2-5-3-3-1-3-9-8-8-8-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:02.440]  In closing on this plug here, we've added three special reports that a lot of work went into.
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:13.440]  Three prisonplanet.tv members. There's three new reports up there this week.
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:22.440]  There's another one going up Monday. These are reports that people put a lot of time into. These are documentaries.
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:29.440]  And then we put a free one out that took two days to make of the FEMA camp in Taylor
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:34.440]  with all the supplied documents and video clips. We just put that out for free on Google Video.
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:39.440]  So we also try to put out a lot of stuff free so you subsidize the truth.
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:44.440]  You fund us in this fight when you become prisonplanet.tv members. That's how we pay my people
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:49.440]  so they can have gas for their cars and food to eat and maybe get a bonus at Christmas.
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:55.440]  So please support us. All right, let's go to Webster Griffin at Tarpley for the next 25 minutes or so.
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:59.440]  And he joins us from his home in Washington, D.C.
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:07.440]  Webster, I want to get your take on what we see coming up in 2007, the neocons, Iran, the Saddam execution.
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:14.440]  But before we do that, I know you're a real expert on the Bush junta and how they really came to power
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:18.440]  by stabbing Nixon in the back. You've written books and articles on the subject.
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:21.440]  So happy New Year to you and good to have you on with us.
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:25.440]  Thank you, Alex. Happy New Year to you and happy New Year to your listeners.
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:31.440]  Webster, tell us. I mean, you've written some articles about this and you've also got great analysis on it.
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:38.440]  Tell us about what happened back in 1974 with General Ford in 1975 and then take us up to speed on what you see happening in the new year.
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:43.440]  Well, I think the first thing is we've just had this attempt to rewrite history around General Ford
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:47.440]  and naturally our sympathies go to the bereaved family.
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:51.440]  We cannot allow this tremendous lying campaign to stand.
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:55.440]  General Ford was a loyal servant of the invisible government.
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:41:02.440]  He was essentially a stooge of the banking faction in Wall Street that runs the United States.
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:09.440]  And that's basically his career. And in particular, to understand what he did, you've got to understand what Watergate was.
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:18.440]  A lot of people, especially the leftists, have bought into this myth about two crusading journalists who love democracy and the lovable, curmudgeon editor
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:26.440]  who lets them put this in the Washington Post and they bring down this tremendously powerful machine in the White House.
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:30.440]  It's sort of David and Goliath with Woodward and Bernstein being the David.
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:32.440]  This is absolutely ridiculous.
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:44.440]  Watergate is a coup d'état carried out by the intelligence community against a throwaway puppet, a villain, of course, a criminal, certainly, Richard Nixon.
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:53.440]  But the main thing to focus on is that this tended to consolidate and increase the power of the secret intelligence agencies over the United States.
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:59.440]  Just a couple of notes on this. It all starts with leaks. It starts with the leaking of the Pentagon Papers and other leaks.
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:06.440]  Who did the Pentagon Papers? Daniel Ellsberg of the Rand Corporation with the top secret security clearance.
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:10.440]  He was somebody who chose targets for thermonuclear weapons.
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:13.440]  So somebody from the bowels of the intelligence community.
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:19.440]  Then Henry Kissinger inside the White House goes to Nixon and says, these leaks are killing us.
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:24.440]  We've got to set up a secret police department here in the White House. Let's call it the Plumbers.
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:34.440]  This is Henry Kissinger with strong ties to British intelligence, a protege of Nelson Rockefeller, and therefore that entire intelligence community faction.
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:36.440]  Who do they hire for the plumbers?
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:40.440]  Well, two of the most prominent CIA agents of the Cold War.
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:54.440]  Howard Hunt above all who had been in Guatemala, the Kennedy assassination, and so forth. James McCord of the CIA, Gordon Liddy of the FBI, somebody with I suppose Nazi sympathies, I guess it's fair to say.
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:59.440]  And they set up this group of plumbers who are also penetrated by other people.
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:02.440]  They have four attempted break-ins.
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:08.440]  In other words, they keep going back to the Democratic National Committee until they finally get arrested.
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:13.440]  You can read this in a book called Secret Agenda by Jim Hogan.
[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:17.440]  And then after the fourth break-in, they're finally caught.
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:23.440]  They're put in the dock in a criminal court and Bob Woodward just happens to be there.
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:26.440]  Who's Bob Woodward? He is from the Office of Naval Intelligence.
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:31.440]  He is somebody who was the intelligence officer for one of the floating command posts.
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:36.440]  Very interesting, right? In case of thermonuclear war, the president can go to a land bunker.
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:39.440]  So it's all these key shadow government individuals.
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:45.440]  I should also add that Miss Graham was one of the head Bilderberg group members attended every meeting.
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:49.440]  Her husband, before that Donald Graham, had been one of the co-chairmen.
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:44:02.440]  So there they got, this is the incredible thoroughbred of old line establishment propaganda media running the whole operation against Nixon,
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:07.440]  who at the end was starting to balk at some of the things that the globalist wanted to do.
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:09.440]  So it was perfect for them.
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:15.440]  So really, I guess a coup d'etat against the presidency, the presidency had been corrupt previously,
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:22.440]  but now this is the intelligence agencies with the private networks fully discrediting the office of the presidency and taking it over.
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:28.440]  Washington Post, I think you have to see what the Washington Post is in addition to what Watergate is.
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:31.440]  Eugene Meyer is the founder of the modern-day Washington Post.
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:39.440]  He was in the Federal Reserve when Franklin D. Roosevelt rightly dumped the British-dominated gold standard in 1933.
[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:42.440]  Eugene Meyer says, this is the end of the world.
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:46.440]  We've got to reassert the domination of financiers against the Roosevelt New Deal.
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:48.440]  I'm going to Washington.
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:53.440]  I'm going to create a newspaper that will fight Roosevelt and everything that he stands for.
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:55.440]  Therefore, you look at the Washington Post.
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:59.440]  It is the house organ of the Federal Reserve system and of the financiers.
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:08.440]  And their vested interest is a weak passive presidency so that the financiers and the Federal Reserve can run wild and run the country.
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:09.440]  And that's basically what it is.
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:16.440]  So then their reporter, Bob Woodward of the Office of Naval Intelligence with his cosmic intelligence clearance,
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:19.440]  leaks from Mark Feldt of the FBI.
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:20.440]  They get the hearings going.
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:25.440]  Then John Dean comes forward with his revelations and this guy, Alexander Butterfield,
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:32.440]  who says, oh, by the way, there's a taping system in the White House and then it goes down to the smoking gun tape.
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:35.440]  Now, most people have forgotten what's in the smoking gun tape.
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:41.440]  In the smoking gun tape, Nixon is talking about a plan for obstruction of justice and perjury.
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:45.440]  And he says, those Texans have got to say this, that, and the other thing.
[01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:46.440]  The Texans are the Texans.
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:48.440]  Who are the Texans he's talking about?
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:53.440]  Well, George H.W. Bush and his partner, Leetke, from Penn's Oil,
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:57.440]  those are the Texans who were laundering money from Texas to Mexico
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:01.440]  and then into the coffers of the committee to re-elect the President.
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:03.440]  And of course, Bush had been CIA Director, Ambassador to China.
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:04.440]  He'd also been a Congresswoman.
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:05.440]  Well, he came that later.
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:07.440]  This is now after this.
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:10.440]  The CIA Director comes later, Ambassador to China.
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:12.440]  These are things in 75-76.
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:20.440]  The contributions in question are from 71-72 for the re-election campaign of Nixon.
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:25.440]  So therefore, Gerald Ford, when Gerald Ford is told by Nelson Rockefeller
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:30.440]  that he has just appointed his vice president, a very risky thing to do,
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:34.440]  Rockefeller tells Ford, you've got to pardon Nixon.
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:35.440]  Why?
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:39.440]  Not for humanitarian concern about Nixon and certainly not to heal a country
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:42.440]  or any of this other maudlin sentimentality that we've been hearing.
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:46.440]  The goal is that if you put Nixon's back to the wall,
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:51.440]  his legal defense may be to fight back against a conspiracy for a coup d'etat
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:53.440]  with all of these agencies.
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:59.440]  Which is what Nixon was starting to tell his confidants.
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:03.440]  And then now we hear he was paranoid, he was insane, he was delusional,
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:05.440]  but really it was just the truth.
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:10.440]  Well, I don't have very much tenderness or optimism about Nixon as a figure,
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:12.440]  but the fact is this is what happened.
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:14.440]  It is a coup d'etat.
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:15.440]  Nixon was entrapped.
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:21.440]  Obviously his proclivity to engage in illegal behavior came into play.
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:22.440]  That's also clear.
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:26.440]  But the essence of the matter is the goal of this entire operation
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:29.440]  was to permanently weaken the office of the presidency,
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:31.440]  to weaken the government as a whole.
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:34.440]  Well, that's what Clinton was also meant to do on an ongoing basis.
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:35.440]  But let's go back.
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:39.440]  We also have Gerald Ford being selected because he was on the Warren Commission.
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:43.440]  And what do you think of the nerve at the D.C. funeral, one of three or four,
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:47.440]  a few days ago when we have the transcripts saying that,
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:51.440]  well, for all of you that think that something else happened with JFK,
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:53.440]  it was a lone nut gunman.
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:59.440]  And this is proven by the incredible Gerald Ford who everybody knows word is the truth.
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:00.440]  I mean, this is...
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:04.440]  We have to remember, Lyndon B. Johnson once said,
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:09.440]  Gerald Ford is so stupid that he can't walk and chew gum at the same time.
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:12.440]  That's what comes of playing all those football games with no helmet.
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:18.440]  I would also cite the right-wing reactionary editor of the Manchester Union leader
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:20.440]  in New Hampshire, William Loeb.
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:25.440]  And his name for the D.C. former president, Jerry The Jerk.
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:27.440]  He said, Jerry The Jerk just came to town.
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:29.440]  So imagine Johnson.
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:34.440]  He knows that Ford is this imbecile, basically.
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:37.440]  And he puts him on the Warren Commission.
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:41.440]  This doesn't indicate that he really expects the Warren Commission to do very much.
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:44.440]  Ford is on there as filler, as a hand-raiser,
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:50.440]  as somebody who can simply be counted on to approve whatever Alan Dulles and John J. McCloy...
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:55.440]  Why do you think Bush Sr. would shoot his mouth off like that on national television?
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:00.440]  Well, of course, Bush Sr. is up to his neck in it in the sense that he is...
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:03.440]  No, clearly involved in the JFK assassination, clearly involved in Bay of Pigs.
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:04.440]  That's the point I'm making.
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:09.440]  I mean, is it just doddering or is there some arrogant McEvellean reason he did this?
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:13.440]  Well, you know, one of the great phrases of Watergate is,
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:15.440]  all the trees in the forest will fall.
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:22.440]  And I'm convinced that if 9-11 truth comes out, we break through the question of the 9-11 conspiracy.
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:28.440]  You will then see that that being taken back in time to include things like the Kennedy assassination,
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:33.440]  the Gulf of Tonkin, the Vietnam War, and a whole series of other tremendous crimes.
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:40.440]  Ron Contra really ought to be reopened in the light of Negroponte and Gates and people like this being so prominent.
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:42.440]  All the trees in the forest must fall.
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:49.440]  And once you begin to pull on this cord of the invisible government, the rogue network, the secret team,
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:52.440]  you begin to then get a new view of all of these things.
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:55.440]  And maybe that's what Bush the Elder is concerned about.
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:58.440]  A couple of other things about Ford.
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:04.440]  Martin is obviously to protect the machine that had taken power.
[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:10.440]  It's also interesting that all of these invisible government heavies that we see around today get their start under Ford.
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:16.440]  People like Cheney, Rumsfeld, Greenspan, Bremer, the guy who destroyed Iraq.
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:21.440]  Bush the Elder, of course, tries to become Vice President.
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:23.440]  It's a forgotten episode.
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:29.440]  In August of 1974, the Vice Presidency was vacant when Ford moved up.
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:36.440]  And there was a contest at that point between Nelson Rockefeller and George Bush the Elder to see which of them would become Vice President.
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:40.440]  So whichever way Ford went, he was obviously in trouble.
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:42.440]  It went to Rockefeller.
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:55.440]  And that then cleared the way for Sarah Jane Moore and Lynette Squeaky-Farm to either produce a pistol in the precinct of the President or to take a pot shot at him in the other case.
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:51:01.440]  And of course, the beneficiary of those assassination attempts would have been Nelson Rockefeller.
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:10.440]  Obviously, you know, Chase Manhattan, Standard Oil, CIA faction, Committee for Latin American Intelligence during World War II, and so forth.
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:13.440]  So if you want to be President, don't have one of these financier types.
[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:20.440]  And then we can walk this right through as the better enemies, Reagan and Bush Sr., and then as soon as they get in, they shoot Reagan.
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:22.440]  I want to talk a little bit about that.
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:25.440]  And then I want to look forward and get a few of your predictions for 2007.
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:28.440]  I'm Alex Jones in FullWars.com is the website.
[01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:31.440]  We're talking to Webster Griffin Tarpley, author and radio talk show host.
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:40.440]  It's here after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, mighty film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:48.440]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:56.440]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:52:08.440]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program we disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:12.440]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:14.440]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:18.440]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:54:50.440 --> 01:55:07.440]  Welcome back, Webster. This is about five minutes from the next hour, and then we've got Tony Gosling of bilgenberg.org to give us some amazing information coming up in the third hour on this live Friday edition.
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:23.440]  Webster, finishing up, let's talk about how Bush Sr. then got in with Reagan. It's admitted that he hated Reagan. Reagan had said he was a horrible CFR globalist, and then Reagan had different policies until he got shot, and then suddenly he was pro-New World Order from that time on.
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:28.440]  And we know the Secret Service really shot him from all the evidence we have. Can you talk about that?
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:43.440]  The interesting thing here is that Ronald Reagan hated George Bush the Elder, didn't want him on the ticket, and Reagan obviously was somebody who did not understand things conceptually. He didn't understand some of the things that you've just been mentioning.
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:56:03.440]  What he had seen, though, was the Nashua Telegraph debate, which was set up by George Bush through various intrigues as Bush, Reagan, but there were other candidates. There was Bob Dole, there was Howard Baker, there was Phil Crane, there was John Anderson, there were four or five other Republicans, all well-known figures, who wanted to be part of the debate.
[01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:14.440]  And Reagan said, sure, fine, get some chairs for all of them. George Bush said, no, no, it's my debate. It's my party and so forth. So he'll have a fit.
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:25.440]  So Bush had a fit in public at the debate. This is the famous, I'm paying for this microphone, Mr. Breen, when they tried to prevent Reagan from inviting these people to take their places.
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:41.440]  And this is one of the ways Bush lost the 1980 primers. So after seeing that, Reagan said, I don't want him. So what they did was this, an intrigue with Kissinger representing Ford, actually being his controller, negotiating with the Reagan people.
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:52.440]  Would Ford come on the ticket as a co-president or vice president? And Ford began saying, yes, I'll do it, but I want Henry Kissinger at the State Department, and I want Alan Greenspan at the Treasury.
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:57:02.440]  Imagine this. So they essentially played out the string. They ate up the clock until it was, well, the night that Reagan had to make the announcement.
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:09.440]  And Reagan had focused everything on getting Ford on the ticket to increase his chances, right, to get the prestige of a former president.
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:26.440]  And at a certain point that night, Jerry Ford then sent Kissinger over to say, no, it can't be done. We don't want to do it. At that point, Reagan had two or three hours to find somebody. The only thing he could do was to call Bush the elder and invite him to be the vice presidential candidate.
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:50.440]  Again, just like Ford Rockefeller leading to Sarah Jane Moore and Lynette Squeaky from, Reagan Bush leads to John Hinckley Jr. But in this case, it's even closer in the sense that John Hinckley Jr. has an elder brother, Scott Hinckley, who is constantly meeting with Neil Bush, the son of the former president,
[01:57:50.440 --> 01:58:01.440]  the brother of the current tenant of the White House. And of course, that is a tremendous appearance of a conflict of interest. And it's all confirmed.
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:11.440]  It's in the Houston Post, the Rocky Mountain News, an AP wire documents the fact that these admissions were made.
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:26.440]  So Ford essentially is a guy who allows himself to be part of the scheme. When Ford is leaving the airport from the Republican National Convention in 1980, a reporter asked him, hey, President Ford, what did you think of that convention?
[01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:33.440]  And Ford says, I think it's great. I came here to get George Bush on the ticket and I succeeded. So the whole thing was a farce.
[01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:48.440]  One last interesting thing, the 1976 election was actually won by Ford. But by this time, the Trilateral Commission had already chosen Carter and had presented him at the meeting of the Trilateral Commission in Kyoto, Japan.
[01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:58.440]  Carter was going to bring on Brzezinski for foreign affairs, Volcker for the Federal Reserve. So they thought it was time to further weaken the presidency by getting Ford out Carter in.
[01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:06.440]  And therefore Carter got through with both fraud. And when you come back, I can maybe tell you how well Ford was convinced to surrender.
[01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:11.440]  Yeah, we got a break. We'll only have five minutes, but I want to also look forward to the next year.

[01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:28.440]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:36.440]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:43.440]  Medical course, potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:59:43.440 --> 01:59:50.440]  Radioactive poisoning. Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:59:50.440 --> 02:00:03.440]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful air than the iodide form, because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:15.440]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling new millennium at 888-803-4438. Call now and get free shipping.

[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:52.440]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:27.440]  I think we've covered enough about Nixon and Bush and Ford and all those different machinations and skull-duggery that went on in their Machiavellian world.
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:35.440]  But I want to look forward to the next year. You, I know don't pull any punches and don't toot your own horn or my horn.
[02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:54.440]  But many, and C-SPAN admits their most highly viewed group of programs ever was the four re-airings, and since they've done it several other times, the hype that was generated and built up with the hour and 50-minute C-SPAN roundtable discussion we had pointing the finger
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:02:05.440]  to the other 9-11 shows that have been on there really haven't been that hardcore. We didn't pull any punches. And it's had a massive effect. I know you've been crediting that with breaking the 9-11 dam.
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:13.440]  And yes, since then, we now see 84% of the national scientific poll not buying the official story. Do you want to speak to that?
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:25.440]  I would say that that conference that you put on, that panel that was put on C-SPAN and that you've also distributed, is the single most important ingredient in the outcome of the 2006 election.
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:38.440]  In other words, the defeat of Bush, the fact that the demagogy of terror, the terror hysteria that Bush had relied on to win that election once again, and Carl Roebhead simply failed.
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:51.440]  And it opens the door now to something different. However, let me point out, I've just been watching the American Enterprise Institute conference with Frederick Kagan and General Keane, followed by Senator McCain and Senator Lieberman.
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:03:04.440]  In other words, the warmonger clique. And they're talking about what Bush will announce next week. He's going to announce 20,000 or 30,000 more GIs to be sent into this desperate situation in Iraq.
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:18.440]  This sets the stage for a constitutional crisis of the First Order, similar to Watergate. And indeed, involving impeachment, whatever poor Mrs. Pelosi thinks about it, impeachment is on the table because the Constitution says it is.
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:37.440]  Hold on, hold on. Pelosi's holding back a dam. 78% of Americans won out, 70% of the troops won out. And she can't even have a press conference because people are shouting them down at the Capitol. This is illustrating the shadow government because Republicans and Democrats won us out of Iraq, but the elite says no way.
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:49.440]  Mrs. Pelosi, I'm afraid, is infected with what I call parliamentary cretinism, which she thinks that the main issue in governing is the atmosphere in the halls of Congress, whether they're having a tea party or a fist fight.
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:59.440]  Well, we don't care whether it's a tea party or a fist fight. We didn't vote for any bipartisan party, which she seems to think is what her task is. She was put there to fight Bush.
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:10.440]  And if she doesn't fight Bush, she will be swept away. Now, Bush is going to make this announcement next week. 12% of the population supports the escalation surge into Iraq.
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:23.440]  The support in the Senate is down to 12 Republican senators, and the rest are opposed to this. And of course, you've got the ruling class in its majority is against it, as we saw in the Baker Hamilton report.
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:32.440]  But right now, I see a split in the ruling class. There's a George Shultz group with Bush and the Neocons and Limbaugh and the rest of these people on the one side.
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:41.440]  And on the other side, you've got the Baker group, which are the moderate imperialists. And their line is, we can't just have it. The United States, Britain and Israel fight the world.
[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:51.440]  We've got to recruit more puppet states, more stooges. We've got to peel the Syrians away from Iran, set up a Sunni-Arab block of perhaps...
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:05:00.440]  It's always been the plan that generates sectarian violence with Brzezinski calling it now, the global Balkans. Webster, we're out of time. Do you think they're going to attack Iran soon?
[02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:16.440]  Well, the Senate is on its way, and what we're calling for is, obviously, fill up their negroponte, don't let negroponte get through the Congress again, and set up preemptive oversight hearings about the coming attack on Iran.
[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:20.440]  All right, Webster Tarpley, we'll talk to you soon. I really appreciate you coming on with us.
[02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:22.440]  Thank you very much, Alex, and happy New Year again.
[02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:27.440]  You too, say hi to your wife and family for me. We'll be right back with Tony Gosling.
[02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:34.440]  Dad, can we stop? We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:37.440]  What? Again? We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:42.440]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their spark-burkey water bottles.
[02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:43.440]  Why did you do that?
[02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:48.440]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing.
[02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:51.440]  Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
[02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:52.440]  For the entire trip.
[02:05:52.440 --> 02:05:56.440]  Hmm, I didn't think about that. Great idea.
[02:05:56.440 --> 02:05:59.440]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:06.440]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle, and using our burkey sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:09.440]  Honey, you're terrific!
[02:06:09.440 --> 02:06:14.440]  Oh, honey, so are you. You're the one that bought the family our sport burkey water bottles.
[02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:17.440]  Now can we stop? I need to go too.
[02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:24.440]  Get your burkey sport purification bottle for only $39 by calling new millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:39.440]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling the distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:47.440]  The rocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:55.440]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:06:55.440 --> 02:07:07.440]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:13.440]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:17.440]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:36.440]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:44.440]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance. If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:51.440]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:07:51.440 --> 02:08:03.440]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects. The 2006 BioSolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:11.440]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes. Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.

[02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:41.440]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:07.440]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen. Now 8 minutes 30 seconds into this third hour today.
[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:15.440]  And there's so much on the Bilderberg website that I don't even really know where to start.
[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:21.440]  Tony Gosling for years has been going to different Bilderberg meetings and covering it.
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:29.440]  He has just put an invaluable resource in that, and he joins us today. He said I believe a London restaurant.
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:36.440]  So that's the background noise you'll hear, but it's always good to bring in some London atmosphere to the international audience.
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:38.440]  Tony, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:53.440]  I'm going to disappoint you, but we're actually down in Bristol. I'm a little nice of a Lebanese restaurant here, but I can tell you that this year's Bilderberg we're going to have a real first, because it's the first time we've ever had a dedicated internet forum which is going to be chasing them down.
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:10:11.440]  The idea being obviously just to give Jim a bit of a hand, Jim Tucker a bit of a hand from this side of the pond in tracking down exactly where they are, because every year it seems to get more and more difficult, more and more secretive to actually discover the correct venue because there's all sorts of false leads go out and that kind of thing.
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:23.440]  So on the old Bilderberg.org there's now a forum where people can discuss that, which is working really quite nicely. On there you'll see that there are two main suspected countries where it's going to be this year.
[02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:37.440]  Obviously it's not going to be over your side. It's going to be for people who are familiar with the Bilderberg. I know that it's going to be in Europe somewhere. It's either Turkey or France, it looks like at the moment, but then we never quite sure if people are tossing false leads.
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:53.440]  Yeah, we were here until the last minute this year that it was going to be in either Austria or Canada. Obviously it was in Ottawa, the capital of Canada, and I was there. You've been to a lot of the European meetings.
[02:10:53.440 --> 02:11:09.440]  I guess every four years it's in North America, but usually three-fourths of the time it is in Europe. But Tony, for those that don't know who you are, tell us how you got involved in this and then what Bilderberg is.
[02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:28.440]  You've gone from the media saying it didn't exist, you were crazy if you talked about it, to it now being in the BBC and CBC and ABC Nightly News and CNN. Walk us through, just in a nutshell, kind of a thumbnail sketch about yourself and Bilderberg and your website, because you really follow this.
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:33.440]  And then I want to get into some of the other stories you've been covering as of late.
[02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:44.440]  Well, first of all, I'm Vice-Chairman of the National Union of Journalists in Bristol, so I've been in touch with a lot of journalists around here. And myself, I was originally working for the BBC as a reporter.
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:57.440]  Now, I found it was very difficult to do exactly what I wanted to do, working within there, but I feel a lot of fear as a freelancer, and I just picked up on some of the stuff to do at the Bilderberg meetings when someone first told me about them.
[02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:12.440]  I really thought, hang on a minute, this can't be true, and when I dug into it and found it was, I thought, well, let's get something up on the internet about this, because it just seemed that it was until the early mid-90s, the internet was arriving just at the right time, where you could kind of do this sort of thing.
[02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:30.440]  So that's really how it all started, and it's kind of gone on from there. I'm now quite active in the UK 9-11 Truth Movement, and I understand, as Webster and many other people do, that 9-11 is at the root and the foundation of this bogus war on terror, and by pulling apart 9-11 and similar type of tax.
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:51.440]  This is the way that we have to sort of get the truth out and to fight the bogusness of it all. I mean, we just heard in the Daily Telegraph just before Christmas that this is an official number 10 policy unit, and it is now recommending microchipping of people as a way of helping to solve crime.
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:13:06.440]  So for years and years, people thought that this was kind of some sort of fiction. Actually now, it's turning out to be, yeah, this is now official number 10 policy, you know, this is unbelievable, but yeah, I mean, people like me have been talking about this kind of thing for, and you, of course, Alex, have been talking about this sort of stuff for years.
[02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:30.440]  I've also had a very, what I think is quite an important article in the National Union of Journalists Journal, which is called, amazingly enough, imaginatively enough, The Journalist, and that was over Christmas, and that was about the London attacks, raising all the sorts of questions that many people who are sort of part of the 9-11 Truth Movement have been talking about for a long, long time.
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:50.440]  And we're talking about things like the, you know, the fact that the Photoshopped image from Malutton showing these four guys, the fact that there's no real evidence that they were actually on the tube network at all that day, the fact that there was a warning given beforehand to the Israeli embassy, you know, this sort of stuff all fits together.
[02:13:50.440 --> 02:14:11.440]  And what I'm basically saying there is that we need to be very, very, very wary about this term, suicide bomber. I mean, if anyone remembers back to April in 2004, they will know that that was when the Shiite insurgency started, because the outside of newspaper in Baghdad was closed down by the U.S. Army.
[02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:28.440]  A bunch of soldiers turned up in Humvees and closed it down, because the previous edition of the paper had had a front-page lead headline saying that suicide bomber was in fact nothing of the sort, and that they had 13 eyewitnesses saying that actually it was a helicopter firing a missile.
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:42.440]  Now, if the military forces are able to get away, we're pulling the wool over journalists' eyes in the heat of the moment, in that fashion, I think we need to be extremely wary. And every time that we hear the term suicide bomber, we need to actually go and check the facts.
[02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:59.440]  If it's a suicide bomber or if there's something else going on, because this is what is being used certainly in this country. I mean, I really don't know quite what's left over in the States, but to demonize Muslims in all sorts of ways. And now they're starting to bring that demonization to Christians too.
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:17.440]  Tony Gosling runs the biggest Bilderberg site out there, Bilderberg.org. Tony, for those that don't know, describe how Bilderberg was founded from your research, what its main goals are, and is there really an internal split in it, and has it gotten larger since the eve of the Gulf War four years ago?
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:29.440]  Well Alex, there are some splits going on, and certainly Bilderberg is having, well the people are connected with it, having all sorts of problems with the Russians at the moment. I think that's what's actually behind this polonium scandal in London.
[02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:47.440]  The Bilderberg meetings actually started back in, for those that don't know, back in 1954. They were convened originally by several characters, a guy called Prince Bernhardt of the Netherlands, who was at the beginning of the war, was actually in the Nazi SS.
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:59.440]  And this was the thing that actually really switched me on to this whole business is, hang on a minute, if this guy was organized by an ex-SS man, how come nobody is interested in it? Well maybe that's because there's some also other ex-SS people protecting him.
[02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:12.440]  Of course, today you can find the remnants of SS in NATO intelligence. A lot of the behavior of the gladiator operations were basically just organized on exactly the same lines as the SS as one of the French journalists at the time.
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:21.440]  Well the Bushes, the Bushes made their first bank off of being top Nazi bag men in the US, so these remnants are everywhere.
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:36.440]  That's right, and also the other guy who was involved in the formation of the Bilderbergs originally, he was trying to remember his name, but he was mentioned by Stephen Dorrell in his history about my six.
[02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:50.440]  He was someone who had probably been an MI6 agent. He was also implicated in the death of General Sikorski. General Sikorski was the representative of Poland during World War II and died mysteriously in an accident.
[02:16:50.440 --> 02:17:00.440]  Now this is a bit bizarre, but actually it was the Polish that we went into World War II, Britain led the world into World War II to stop the Nazi invasion of Poland.
[02:17:00.440 --> 02:17:09.440]  By the end of it, we were stabbing the leader of Poland in the back. That gives you an idea of the kind of shenanigans that go over on these kind of big issues over the war.
[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:22.440]  It just seems to me that the beginning of Bilderberg is mired in intrigue and actually quite horrendous acts, and these people who were involved in putting it together were.
[02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:34.440]  So immediately that makes up for me that this is something that needs proper investigation. How many years ago was that, Tony? How many years ago did you start following it? How many Bilderberg meetings have you been to?
[02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:52.440]  Well, I first decided to do something because I was actually in Wandsworth in London, right next to the River Thames, and we had decided to take over some land. We were squatting some land as a protest action about the building of the supermarket and also saying that we want more eco-friendly buildings in the city.
[02:17:52.440 --> 02:18:06.440]  It was a 17-acre site that had been owned by Guinness, and this was in 1996. We actually took the place over in the beginning of the year. I think it was about April, March, April time.
[02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:23.440]  I managed to actually get a community going on there of about 40-50 people who actually built their own homes with growing vegetables, or this kind of thing, on the next factory site. Actually, it was very, very fertile land, and we had all sorts of growing going on, and we got quite a bit of news coverage.
[02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:33.440]  Anyway, one of the chats had seen us on the news and came to have a chat with us. Somebody who obviously knew about the Bilderberg, and he said, well, hang on a minute.
[02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:41.440]  You're looking at the land issue here, but you've got to also look at the money issue. What about the issue of money? This is another massive problem that needs to be sorted out in the world.
[02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:50.440]  And I listened to him. He sounds like a very sensible chap, but at the end of it, he mentioned this organization. He said, the Bilderbergs, no one even knows about them, but they really run the Western world.
[02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:54.440]  And I said, hang on, what are you talking about? This sounds like some kind of fantasy.
[02:18:54.440 --> 02:19:03.440]  But then when I got back to the office, dutifully checked up what he said, I thought I'd have a little search on the internet, and had a trawl through all the article databases of Reuters.
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:09.440]  And I found lots of very, very, what I would call incriminating evidence about them, which I then cut and pasted and put on the web.
[02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:16.440]  So that was how it kind of started in the first place, and it's just taken off from there with all sorts of other things kind of being looked at now.
[02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:29.440]  And at the moment, for example, I'm doing an investigation into the fact that Tony Blair lied in the House of Commons when he talked about not going to a Bilderberg meeting with Norman Baker, who's a Liberal MP,
[02:19:29.440 --> 02:19:43.440]  asked the question in the Commons, and another Liberal Lord asked the similar question, the Lords, and they both got really what I would say was either, I think in the Lords, it was kind of unequivocal, like neither confirming or denying.
[02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:54.440]  But Blair actually said, no, I've never been. Now, I actually spoke to the woman who served Tony Blair's breakfast at the Tilbury Conference, so I'm absolutely certain he was there.
[02:19:54.440 --> 02:20:10.440]  And so why is he actually doing this? Well, I mean, I'm now working with Norman Baker on an investigation, and then hopefully we can get Mr Blair to retract his lie, you know, because it's absolutely not on.
[02:20:10.440 --> 02:20:16.440]  I don't understand why it is. He has to even say that he's had nothing to do with it. It seems clearly that he hasn't.
[02:20:16.440 --> 02:20:32.440]  Tony Gosling, stay there. I want to come back and talk about a few articles you've done lately about Prince Charles and some of the occult activities he's involved with, as well as Tony Blair and Princess Diana, some of the new developments there.
[02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:42.440]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson here for the 2007 Red Book. The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:52.440]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S. dollar can be devalued. Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:20:52.440 --> 02:21:02.440]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.

[02:23:30.440 --> 02:23:44.440]  It's no secret, aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable of causing DNA damage. Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects. So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[02:23:44.440 --> 02:24:00.440]  Well, there is an alternative, and it's called nobio. Nobio eliminates the bacterial growth, which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration, which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins. There are no chemicals, aluminum, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients in nobio.
[02:24:00.440 --> 02:24:12.440]  Just natural ingredients like grapeseed oil, arrowroot powder, silica, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and uranium. Nobio's job is to destroy the bacteria that causes the odor while soothing your skin. You can use nobio under your arms.

[02:24:42.440 --> 02:25:00.440]  Tony Gosling is our guest. He runs Builderburg.org, and he's been to quite a few of the meetings. He has witnessed some of the police state tactics of Builderburg Group.
[02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:16.440]  Tony, people like Jim Tucker, have been shot at before. He's been grabbed in Italy and taken away for hours and hours. Daniel Estalon has been detained. I have obviously was detained in Canada because they said Builderburg Group was concerned about me.
[02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:34.440]  If anybody doubts that these people aren't for freedom, why are they so angry at people like yourself, Jim Tucker, Daniel Estalon, myself, and others that try to cover and report on Builderburg? The old cliche is, if you've got 125 top football players meeting, the media would be there.
[02:25:34.440 --> 02:25:54.440]  125 top Hollywood people, there'd be media beating down the doors. 125 scientists people would wonder why. You've got 125 royalty, robber barons, elitist politicians meeting, and they want people detained. Can you tell us about that and any experiences you've had?
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:26:16.440]  I've found them to be quite reasonable, really. The fact that they won't send me any information generally speaking about who's been at the meetings is a real problem. I haven't been shot at. I've only been questioned by the secret police at various places that I've been to.
[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:34.440]  I haven't really had any hassle, but my approach to the Builderburgers is always that I want to give them a way out of what they're doing because it seems to me that there must be people within the Builderburg and similar organizations and those connected with them that don't actually take their point of view.
[02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:54.440]  Therefore, I don't really want to standpoint the finger and condemn because although they're obviously involved in all sorts of dangerous, nefarious stuff, I don't want to be the person to condemn them. I want to expose what they're doing, expose the facts, and that's really what it's all about for me.
[02:26:54.440 --> 02:27:13.440]  Last thing I want to do is to start to demonize them anymore. They may be demons, but that's not for me to decide. I don't want to do that demonizing and I want to always make sure that they have got a way out. My approach is really that you really shouldn't be doing this and isn't it better that you just walk away from this?
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:16.440]  Now, they may not do that, but that's still my approach and it always will be.
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:36.440]  Now, I noticed you told my radio producer and you sent us a few articles that you put together, others you're covering, about Prince Charles and in bizarre occultic things that is property. Why do you think that's important? I think it's important. I, of course, have covered it. How often does the occult pop up when you're researching these people?
[02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:50.440]  Well, I mean, all you have to do, actually, I mean, I'm in Bristol, in south-west England, and just the other side of the M4 motorway is where Prince Charles's main country residence is, where he's in London, he's in St. James' Palace, and it's very, very close to here.
[02:27:50.440 --> 02:28:10.440]  Anyway, I and some friends went on a ramble, sort of little wander over there towards the end of last year, and I actually couldn't believe my eyes. What I saw in Prince Charles's back garden, which is a large field for the sheep, was a giant column with a carved metal phoenix on the top of it.
[02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:20.440]  I think, what the hell is this doing here? I, of course, got onto a good old Wikipedia and found that there was something on there that was absolutely identical to it.
[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:32.440]  So I think, you know, that's exactly the kind of thing which is on the back of the US dollar, and it doesn't at all surprise me that maybe Prince Charles is into this kind of stuff, even though he very publicly came out and said he's not a Freemason,
[02:28:32.440 --> 02:28:42.440]  but what maybe he's into something even more dodgy, you know, this is certainly where I see it. But I first got interested in Charles really looking into the Diana killing,
[02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:52.440]  and I think it, you know, my personal feeling is definitely it was an assassination of some sort, but there are a lot of people give different reasons as to why this might have been.
[02:28:52.440 --> 02:29:02.440]  It just so happens that a friend of my family used to work for MI6. Her job was seducing Middle Eastern leaders for, that was what she was paid to do, to get information.
[02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:04.440]  They call those swallows.
[02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:16.440]  Yeah, well, yeah, she was the honey trap, yeah? So anyway, she was getting information out of these people, and she said, this was just literally a few weeks after the Diana thing.
[02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:27.440]  We met her. It was a big family event, and before she had this kind of real cloud about her. She was normally very bubbly, happy chappy lady.
[02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:33.440]  But she said, look, before we sit down and eat, you know, I want to tell you a few things about Diana. MI6 did it.
[02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:50.440]  And the reasons she gave were various, but the main ones were, first of all, that the royal family had a real big downer on Diana's media and public profile, everywhere that Charles and Diana went.
[02:29:50.440 --> 02:29:57.440]  And of course, they were still going around together in the early days. In fact, when I was working for the BBC, I did some stuff.
[02:29:57.440 --> 02:30:03.440]  Lee Gosling, expert on Bilderberg Group and the New World Order activities, is with us. Stay there, Tony.
[02:30:03.440 --> 02:30:15.440]  Big segment coming up. I want to get into this and talk about these secret societies in Princess Diana and her murder and what's on the Bilderberg agenda coming up in 2007, and a lot more on the other side.
[02:30:15.440 --> 02:30:20.440]  We'll be right back.
[02:30:20.440 --> 02:30:30.440]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:38.440]  What is the secret of the sea? It's the exciting food from the sea, and it can be yours with nature's original superfood from walkers.

[02:32:30.440 --> 02:32:41.440]  It's a fact. You can legally eliminate credit card debt which has been fraudulently created by the banks. Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[02:32:41.440 --> 02:32:52.440]  So why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours? There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[02:32:52.440 --> 02:33:02.440]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors. We also do credit restoration.

[02:33:43.440 --> 02:33:53.440]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[02:33:53.440 --> 02:34:05.440]  Say that chocolate to the beat. There's too much confusion. I can't get no relief.
[02:34:05.440 --> 02:34:18.440]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. You know, my frustration is over a decade ago, I came into possession of public documents in globalist think tank agreements that they were setting up in North American Union.
[02:34:18.440 --> 02:34:28.440]  I learned that the Bilderberg Group 12 years ago plus had set up the European Union. They bragged about it. And then I'd get on the radio and talk about it.
[02:34:28.440 --> 02:34:40.440]  The media would say I was a crazy kook who believed in imaginary organizations. Now because of Tony Gosling's work and Jim Tucker and Estelon and many others, most people know that there really are global elites.
[02:34:40.440 --> 02:34:53.440]  They really are pushing for world government. They want to get rid of our national sovereignty because by setting up new governmental systems, they can ensure that they don't have the checks and balances that England and the U.S. and other countries have had.
[02:34:53.440 --> 02:35:05.440]  The Magna Carta, common law, the Bill of Rights Constitution. And there's no doubt from the minutes we've gotten, the documents we've gotten at Bilderberg does want this one world tax, one world army, this whole system.
[02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:13.440]  And we need, you know, now that we can get the people to admit there's an elite, you know, folks in the past always knew there was one.
[02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:20.440]  Now we have the society in denial. Tony Gosling joining us from England. What was it like for you when you learned of this?
[02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:29.440]  I mean, did you run into opposition, people who were still in denial? And then can you compare that now to the atmosphere? Are people more open to this?
[02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:35.440]  Well, I mean, I'm quite happy to run into people that disagree with me. I think that's actually quite a healthy world where people disagree with each other.
[02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:40.440]  I don't think everyone has to agree. And so it was something I was, you know, right from the beginning I was prepared for.
[02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:46.440]  But it just seems that more and more people do agree as time goes on.
[02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:51.440]  So, I mean, really, you know, I'm not surprised if people disagree. That's great. Let them get, let them talk about it.
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:36:01.440]  But of course, what happens is in the years as I've just been talking about with the number 10, talking about our microchip implants for British people,
[02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:06.440]  actually, people say that this is impossible. But when they actually see it comes light and they suddenly remember,
[02:36:06.440 --> 02:36:09.440]  hang on, we were told about this sort of 10 years ago, weren't we?
[02:36:09.440 --> 02:36:19.440]  So, you know, I think it's sort of inevitable, really, that certainly be surely more and more members of the public and the media are coming to take our point of view, Alex.
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:25.440]  Tony, Tony, elaborate on that because the Mexican government tried to make its employees take chips. Other governments are doing it.
[02:36:25.440 --> 02:36:29.440]  You were talking about new developments with that. Why don't you elaborate on it?
[02:36:29.440 --> 02:36:39.440]  Well, it was something that was in the Daily Telegraph. I mean, people want to actually follow it up and go on to the British 9-11 forum at www.9-11.
[02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:46.440]  That's N-I-N-E. That's the letters, not the numbers. 9-11 and then the word 11.co.uk. And you can have a look there.
[02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:53.440]  But there's an article in the Daily Telegraph just before Christmas, I believe, or maybe just after Christmas, just before New Year,
[02:36:53.440 --> 02:37:03.440]  where this number 10 policy think tank has actually suggested that because they believe that there will be rising rates of crime due to economic tension over the next few years,
[02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:10.440]  in Britain, that they think that people should be microchipped. Now, this is quite fascinating for me because, I mean, I've been looking into this for years,
[02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:15.440]  and it's hoping, you know, against hope, that this wasn't going to be something which was going to be even contemplative.
[02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:19.440]  I missed that article, but we're seeing some more ones in the U.S. I mean, this isn't a joke.
[02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:26.440]  I think you missed the article as well, Alex, because the headline had nothing to do with that. It was saying something like a fighting crime.
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:31.440]  Now, you and I would not necessarily associate putting a microchip in you with anything to do with fighting crime.
[02:37:31.440 --> 02:37:38.440]  So it was a toned-down headline in the Daily Telegraph. But once you got to all the bother of the article, you realized, actually, this is what they're talking about.
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:46.440]  Well, there's an article today. It's in my stack with a headline like, Local Schools Get Control.
[02:37:46.440 --> 02:37:55.440]  And then you read it and it says, the feds are making schools put cameras in coast to coast. I mean, it's always the opposite.
[02:37:55.440 --> 02:38:02.440]  But you've got journalists who are telling the truth, and editors who are coming along or sub-editors and then changing headlines and, you know, moving things around in that fashion.
[02:38:02.440 --> 02:38:09.440]  You know, but the fact is that more and more journalists are aware that there are these problems around, and they're trying to make sure that most stuff gets into these places.
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:18.440]  How is the elite going to deal with that, the fact that people are now waking up to what they're doing?
[02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:26.440]  Well, there's actually no way I don't think they can deal with it, because ultimately their whole plan depends on deception.
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:31.440]  And I'm afraid that deception's failed. So ultimately, they're on a hiding to nothing.
[02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:39.440]  Well, I agree with you in one respect, but in the other, it seems that they're going to deal with it with a police state. They're going, fine, you're waking up to what we're doing.
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:43.440]  We're just going to arrest you if you criticize this, claiming you're aiding terrorists.
[02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:48.440]  I don't think a global police state is ever going to happen. I mean, I know that sounds maybe a bit over-optimistic.
[02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:50.440]  Well, I mean, they're saying we're only going to be made to take chips.
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:55.440]  The thing is that there are many, you know, we're still within the generations that can remember the Nazis.
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:39:01.440]  And certainly here in this country, most of the armed forces would absolutely have nothing to do with that.
[02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:05.440]  You might even find a military coup here in Britain if there was an attempt to bring in a police state.
[02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:08.440]  But they are, I mean, you've got four plus million cameras in London.
[02:39:08.440 --> 02:39:14.440]  They've got microphones going up. The police, every time I've got a video camera on it, and the streets of London will walk up and take down my name.
[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:18.440]  I mean, certainly the police state is starting to unfold right now.
[02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:26.440]  It's slow, but I mean, I don't think that the spirit that the people like the Bilderbergers and others who are going for a global police state,
[02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:30.440]  that the actual ordinary police in this country would never put up with that.
[02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:34.440]  Well, I do think there is resistance and that is good, but we need to be fully aware of it.
[02:39:34.440 --> 02:39:35.440]  Tell me who we're talking about.
[02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:38.440]  That's an important point to make, because we need to be building alliances.
[02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:44.440]  I mean, for example, here in Britain, we had a big demonstration before Christmas at an IAF base,
[02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:49.440]  which is used to bring bodies back and to send troops out to Iraq.
[02:39:49.440 --> 02:39:54.440]  And literally, there were people, many people, families of the soldiers out on the streets,
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:57.440]  marching hand in hand with sort of anti-war demonstrators and campaigners.
[02:39:57.440 --> 02:40:00.440]  And then, you know, they're actually being politicized themselves.
[02:40:00.440 --> 02:40:01.440]  I mean, we had a big thing.
[02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:04.440]  And the major news here in Britain yesterday was that the army are coming out,
[02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:09.440]  defending the conditions which army staff have to live under.
[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:12.440]  You know, for example, they're living accommodation, that kind of thing.
[02:40:12.440 --> 02:40:14.440]  This is really politicizing the army.
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:16.440]  You know, it's interesting you can go back right to the English Civil War
[02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:21.440]  and see how it was the politicization of the army, which really decided the outcome of that war.
[02:40:21.440 --> 02:40:27.440]  And also, the levelers were a civil rights movement within the army.
[02:40:27.440 --> 02:40:30.440]  It was actually mostly the soldiers that were fighting for people's rights.
[02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:34.440]  So I think, you know, we need to not sort of demonize too much the armed forces,
[02:40:34.440 --> 02:40:37.440]  because after all, they were the same armed forces that defeated Hitler.
[02:40:37.440 --> 02:40:40.440]  Yeah, we're not demonizing you and I.
[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:44.440]  Yeah, I know some people do, though. This is one of the things I've signed, is that people are very, very anti-military.
[02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:47.440]  And, yeah, actually, we do need a strong military.
[02:40:47.440 --> 02:40:54.440]  Well, what we're trying to do is demonize those that are trying to misuse the military and police
[02:40:54.440 --> 02:40:59.440]  and demonizing the police state tactics that are attempting to be implemented.
[02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:01.440]  Yeah, well, yeah, I totally agree.
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:06.440]  I mean, also, though, I think it's important to get back to by Diana, because I was just going to give you an update.
[02:41:06.440 --> 02:41:12.440]  In fact, that was one of the next things I was going to bring up about. But, Tony, before we run out of time,
[02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:16.440]  and I want to go back to where you think Bilderberg may be held this year,
[02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:21.440]  it's getting harder and harder to find out each year because they're getting more and more secretive.
[02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:26.440]  Can you speak to that briefly? Then I want to get into Diana, but then because you live in England, you've written about it.
[02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:34.440]  Tony Blair having weird rebirthing ceremonies in southern Mexico at Aztec temples.
[02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:40.440]  Tony Blair channeling the light every morning. Tony Blair and the occult. I wanted to get your analysis on that,
[02:41:40.440 --> 02:41:43.440]  but can you speak to that first?
[02:41:43.440 --> 02:41:47.440]  I mean, there's a story that very, very few people have come across, which is that I find absolutely riveting,
[02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:52.440]  which has come from David Shaler and Annie Mashon, the two XMI-5 agents.
[02:41:52.440 --> 02:42:01.440]  Now, when they first came out, because they basically were booted out because they started revealing the fact that
[02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:07.440]  the MI6 was funding Al Qaeda to assassinate Colonel Gaddafi.
[02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:11.440]  When they first came out, there was a big headline in the Sunday telegraph,
[02:42:11.440 --> 02:42:16.440]  sorry, the Sunday Times saying, oh, Shaler could bring down the government.
[02:42:16.440 --> 02:42:23.440]  And apparently, at that point, and this is what they told me, on Monday morning,
[02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:35.440]  the Mail on Sunday got a call from number 10 Downing Street, Tony Blair, phoned up the editor, Jonathan Holbera,
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:37.440]  and demanded he come immediately to Downing Street.
[02:42:37.440 --> 02:42:41.440]  Now, then Blair took him out into the garden, and of course, he'd do that if you don't want to be bugged.
[02:42:41.440 --> 02:42:45.440]  And said to Jonathan Holbera, what does Shaler know about me?
[02:42:45.440 --> 02:42:47.440]  What does Shaler know?
[02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:54.440]  And it turns out that Holbera then said to him, well, I'm afraid we can't tell you,
[02:42:54.440 --> 02:42:58.440]  because your government put an injunction on us last night, and I can't tell you anything.
[02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:03.440]  But the fact was that Shaler and Mashon, whilst they'd been at MI5,
[02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:08.440]  had spoken to one of their colleagues who had seen Tony Blair's security file,
[02:43:08.440 --> 02:43:14.440]  and he said that Blair had been working for MI5 right the way through his early political career.
[02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:17.440]  In college, he was recruited.
[02:43:17.440 --> 02:43:23.440]  He was working for, he was part of the campaign for nuclear disarmament.
[02:43:23.440 --> 02:43:25.440]  Yeah, well, he was involved with communist groups, yeah.
[02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:28.440]  That's right, but he wasn't actually, you know, and everyone was quite astounded.
[02:43:28.440 --> 02:43:32.440]  How come this guy who used to be kind of communist lefty, but actually it turns out...
[02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:33.440]  He was an infiltrator.
[02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:39.440]  He was almost certain that he was actually, at the time, you know, just giving information.
[02:43:39.440 --> 02:43:40.440]  Uninformant.
[02:43:40.440 --> 02:43:44.440]  Uninformant services on these groups, yeah, the guys now supposedly running this country.
[02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:45.440]  It's quite frightening.
[02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:50.440]  Well, it's like Putin running Rajya Bush, running, you know, it's all these former CIA people.
[02:43:50.440 --> 02:43:54.440]  Yeah, but I don't think Putin is in the same league as Blair, really.
[02:43:54.440 --> 02:43:57.440]  I mean, Putin has obviously decided that he's not really interested in the whole
[02:43:57.440 --> 02:44:01.440]  war on terror, Western way of doing things, and he's separating himself from that in a way.
[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:05.440]  I think he wants to, you know, reassert some sort of control over Russia.
[02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:06.440]  Sure, can you speak?
[02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:08.440]  And I think it's very laudable of him.
[02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:10.440]  Can you speak?
[02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:11.440]  Sorry?
[02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:15.440]  Johnny, can you speak to when and where you think the meeting may be and how hard it's going to be?
[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:18.440]  Well, really, at this stage of the year, we normally just don't know anyway.
[02:44:18.440 --> 02:44:21.440]  But there's only two places that it looks like it may be at the moment.
[02:44:21.440 --> 02:44:28.440]  One is Turkey, because one of the Turkish participants in last year's conference said that
[02:44:28.440 --> 02:44:30.440]  when he came back that it was going to be in Turkey.
[02:44:30.440 --> 02:44:33.440]  But we're really never quite sure whether this is a bit of disinformation or not.
[02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:35.440]  And the other place is possibly France.
[02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:38.440]  But it is actually, I think it's getting quite difficult for the Bilderberg now,
[02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:39.440]  because they want to keep a low profile.
[02:44:39.440 --> 02:44:41.440]  And obviously, we want the opposite.
[02:44:41.440 --> 02:44:44.440]  You know, when you've got the kings and queens and various types,
[02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:47.440]  it's very difficult to keep the media away.
[02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:51.440]  Well, I'll tell you, Turkey is more of a police state than Europe,
[02:44:51.440 --> 02:44:55.440]  and that might be a dangerous place for the press to go to cover it.
[02:44:55.440 --> 02:44:57.440]  Are you going to go if it's in Turkey?
[02:44:57.440 --> 02:44:58.440]  Well, we'll see.
[02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:00.440]  I mean, I'm never quite sure whether I'm going to go or not.
[02:45:00.440 --> 02:45:02.440]  I'd usually make that decision quite later on.
[02:45:02.440 --> 02:45:03.440]  How many have you gone to?
[02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:07.440]  I've only been to actually two meetings.
[02:45:07.440 --> 02:45:11.440]  But then, you know, one of the things I've always felt is one of the most fantastic things
[02:45:11.440 --> 02:45:12.440]  to go to the Bilderberg meeting.
[02:45:12.440 --> 02:45:14.440]  It may seem to people that it's not,
[02:45:14.440 --> 02:45:18.440]  but actually what happens is loads of people who are on the case with Bilderberg
[02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:22.440]  and with world affairs generally get together in the various hotels,
[02:45:22.440 --> 02:45:24.440]  often in gyms hotels, sometimes other places.
[02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:27.440]  You get reporters from all around the world sharing information.
[02:45:27.440 --> 02:45:30.440]  And it's almost like you've got a little alternative conference going on.
[02:45:30.440 --> 02:45:36.440]  So I'd recommend to everybody, wherever and whenever we find out where this meeting is going to be this year,
[02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:38.440]  that, you know, people can actually come along,
[02:45:38.440 --> 02:45:43.440]  and then we can have a sort of conflagration in a nearby hotel.
[02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:47.440]  And also, it means there's more people to attract the attention of the national press
[02:45:47.440 --> 02:45:49.440]  in whichever country it happens.
[02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:52.440]  You know, it blew up in their face in Canada when they had me detained.
[02:45:52.440 --> 02:45:54.440]  That helped generate big headlines.
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:45:56.440]  Well, yeah, I mean, this is the sort of thing.
[02:45:56.440 --> 02:46:01.440]  The idea is really just to make sure that the local media are aware of it.
[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:03.440]  And that's what I always try and do.
[02:46:03.440 --> 02:46:08.440]  Now, you wanted to get into Diana, what almost 80% of Brits think that somebody in the government killed him.
[02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:14.440]  We have the press reports where she said Prince Charles says he's going to kill me
[02:46:14.440 --> 02:46:16.440]  in the next few months in a fake auto accident.
[02:46:16.440 --> 02:46:18.440]  She was speaking out against landmines.
[02:46:18.440 --> 02:46:20.440]  She was getting all the headlines.
[02:46:20.440 --> 02:46:22.440]  She was dating an Arab.
[02:46:22.440 --> 02:46:26.440]  I mean, they had a lot of reasons to kill her. The security tapes turned off.
[02:46:26.440 --> 02:46:30.440]  Now we know the driver was on. Intelligence payroll.
[02:46:30.440 --> 02:46:33.440]  Now we know the CIA was bugging them.
[02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:35.440]  I mean, this is really starting to come out.
[02:46:35.440 --> 02:46:36.440]  You've been on the case.
[02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:39.440]  What really happened from all the evidence you've got with Diana?
[02:46:39.440 --> 02:46:45.440]  What people don't, I think, always understand is that it's really a kind of jealousy from Charles.
[02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:49.440]  If he could see that they decided to part company and go their separate ways,
[02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:53.440]  Diana was really much more loved by both the press and the public,
[02:46:53.440 --> 02:47:00.440]  and that the public and the press both really saw him as the culprit for cheating on his wife
[02:47:00.440 --> 02:47:02.440]  and committing adultery with Camilla,
[02:47:02.440 --> 02:47:08.440]  and that Diana, as a virgin, going into that relationship quite possibly as the victim.
[02:47:08.440 --> 02:47:12.440]  I think most of the public understand that he was really responsible for it.
[02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:17.440]  That was, I think, the main reason is because the press and public were very much behind Diana,
[02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:21.440]  and also she knew a lot about the inside workings of the royal family.
[02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:25.440]  But reason number two was one of the ones,
[02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:27.440]  and this is the way I would put them, the order I would put them in,
[02:47:27.440 --> 02:47:34.440]  is that she was an incredible link between the British people and the Muslim world.
[02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:40.440]  The idea of her settling down as she was about to announce her engagement with Dodie the next day
[02:47:40.440 --> 02:47:44.440]  when they flew back to the UK, and that is actually very well documented.
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:47.440]  And the police actually tried to persuade, I don't know if people know about this,
[02:47:47.440 --> 02:47:51.440]  the police tried to persuade the guy who was sold them the engagement ring,
[02:47:51.440 --> 02:47:54.440]  but it wasn't an engagement ring, it was part of the inquiry afterwards,
[02:47:54.440 --> 02:47:57.440]  and of course he kept saying yes it was an engagement ring.
[02:47:57.440 --> 02:47:59.440]  I mean no one's really quite sure to what extent they were leaning on him,
[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:03.440]  but this would have been a big, big problem.
[02:48:03.440 --> 02:48:08.440]  And it does make you really think that maybe the things that we're seeing now,
[02:48:08.440 --> 02:48:11.440]  the pogrom against the Muslim population around the world,
[02:48:11.440 --> 02:48:14.440]  the blaming them like the Nazis blamed the Jews,
[02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:18.440]  was being contemplated at that time well before 9-11.
[02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:20.440]  And they knew that she'd speak out against it.
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:23.440]  Didn't Diana know how much danger she was in?
[02:48:23.440 --> 02:48:26.440]  She told friends, Charles says he's going to kill me in a fake auto accident,
[02:48:26.440 --> 02:48:29.440]  that's been in major papers, that's admitted.
[02:48:29.440 --> 02:48:33.440]  I mean didn't she, she obviously knew, I guess she just was ready to die.
[02:48:33.440 --> 02:48:37.440]  I mean didn't she understand that if she married him or got pregnant,
[02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:38.440]  they were going to kill her for sure?
[02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:42.440]  Well I've seen pictures of her actually doing this landmine stuff.
[02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:44.440]  I think she was an incredibly courageous woman
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:48.440]  and she knew that she was putting her life on the line for her country.
[02:48:48.440 --> 02:48:51.440]  And I think most of the British public also feel that
[02:48:51.440 --> 02:48:54.440]  anyone that actually takes the trouble to look into this
[02:48:54.440 --> 02:48:57.440]  and doesn't come from the Prince Charles camp,
[02:48:57.440 --> 02:49:01.440]  of course he's spent a massive amount on trying to make sure that,
[02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:04.440]  and of course we have the coroner resign as well, the royal coroner resign.
[02:49:04.440 --> 02:49:08.440]  What do the children think about their father murdering their mother?
[02:49:08.440 --> 02:49:10.440]  Well that's the $64,000 question isn't it?
[02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:13.440]  I mean you've got obviously these children,
[02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:19.440]  William and Harry, I would imagine that they have mixed feelings about the whole thing.
[02:49:19.440 --> 02:49:22.440]  It's really, you know, impossible to know though for sure.
[02:49:22.440 --> 02:49:25.440]  One thing's for certain is that she had a very close relationship with them,
[02:49:25.440 --> 02:49:29.440]  very close, and I don't know if people have heard the dinotapes,
[02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:32.440]  I know they had an NBC special a few years ago,
[02:49:32.440 --> 02:49:35.440]  but I actually grabbed the audio off of that
[02:49:35.440 --> 02:49:38.440]  and it's fascinating to listen to Diana talking in her own words
[02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:40.440]  about her relationship with Charles,
[02:49:40.440 --> 02:49:42.440]  a confrontation with Camilla,
[02:49:42.440 --> 02:49:44.440]  and the way that she got over the bulimia
[02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:47.440]  and kind of became much stronger again as a person,
[02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:49.440]  and of course that was what the royal family couldn't bear
[02:49:49.440 --> 02:49:53.440]  the fact that she was independent and strong and well loved by the public.
[02:49:53.440 --> 02:49:56.440]  But they keep having fake inquests, fake investigations,
[02:49:56.440 --> 02:49:58.440]  but the British people aren't buying it,
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:00.440]  that's got to make the establishment angry.
[02:50:00.440 --> 02:50:02.440]  It wasn't really outending a fake inquest.
[02:50:02.440 --> 02:50:04.440]  What's happened with the inquest is the coroner,
[02:50:04.440 --> 02:50:09.440]  it appears, has been very severely lent on to find a particular verdict
[02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:13.440]  and has decided instead of that that he's going to resign, and that's what happened.
[02:50:13.440 --> 02:50:15.440]  Was she really pregnant?
[02:50:15.440 --> 02:50:18.440]  Well, according to my MI6 friend, yes she was,
[02:50:18.440 --> 02:50:24.440]  and that they actually removed the child in the ambulance before she got to hospital.
[02:50:24.440 --> 02:50:27.440]  That's what my MI6 conflict has said about it.
[02:50:27.440 --> 02:50:30.440]  And that's why they spent 45 minutes getting her to...
[02:50:30.440 --> 02:50:32.440]  That's right, they took a long time, yeah.
[02:50:32.440 --> 02:50:35.440]  It's a horrendous thing for anyone to have done,
[02:50:35.440 --> 02:50:40.440]  but of course this is the way the forces of darkness almost relish in operating.
[02:50:40.440 --> 02:50:45.440]  They know that the worst deeds they do, the more disgusting those deeds are,
[02:50:45.440 --> 02:50:49.440]  the less that any of the members of the public and press are going to want to go there.
[02:50:49.440 --> 02:50:52.440]  So this is a kind of psychological tool.
[02:50:52.440 --> 02:50:55.440]  And the worst things you do,
[02:50:55.440 --> 02:50:58.440]  the more disgusting, the more terrible things you do,
[02:50:58.440 --> 02:51:02.440]  the less people are going to actually even consider that that would be possible,
[02:51:02.440 --> 02:51:07.440]  because they play on people's ideas that actually people's human nature would never ever do such things.
[02:51:07.440 --> 02:51:12.440]  And of course we know from the Nazis, of course, that they do.
[02:51:12.440 --> 02:51:13.440]  We do know that.
[02:51:13.440 --> 02:51:15.440]  Unbelievable interview with Tony Gosling.
[02:51:15.440 --> 02:51:17.440]  Final segment is just a few minutes on the other side.
[02:51:17.440 --> 02:51:19.440]  Any other key points you want to add, sir?
[02:51:19.440 --> 02:51:26.440]  It's here after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:51:26.440 --> 02:51:28.440]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:51:28.440 --> 02:51:31.440]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove
[02:51:31.440 --> 02:51:35.440]  that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations
[02:51:35.440 --> 02:51:37.440]  as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:51:37.440 --> 02:51:41.440]  Terror Storm proves that not only do we have the power to fight terrorism,
[02:51:41.440 --> 02:51:44.440]  but we have the power to fight terrorism.
[02:51:44.440 --> 02:51:49.440]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job,
[02:51:49.440 --> 02:51:52.440]  but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:51:52.440 --> 02:51:55.440]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran,
[02:51:55.440 --> 02:51:58.440]  a White House program to disseminate fake news,
[02:51:58.440 --> 02:52:01.440]  NSA spying, secret police torture,
[02:52:01.440 --> 02:52:04.440]  the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:04.440 --> 02:52:08.440]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:08.440 --> 02:52:10.440]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:10.440 --> 02:52:14.440]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
