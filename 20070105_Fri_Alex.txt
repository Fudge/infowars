[00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.133]  ...selling his black and Charolais crossbred cows.
[00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:08.016]  The 40 head string will either be bred or have calves by their sides.
[00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:16.324]  Now John and Denise Simmons will be in with the 45 head string of fancy Angus bred Angus bulls and they'll be mostly March calvers.
[00:00:16.324 --> 00:00:25.392]  This is for the special cow and bread heifer sale coming up this Saturday, January the 6th at the Milan, Missouri Livestock Auction.
[00:00:29.661 --> 00:00:33.651]  You are listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:40.848 --> 00:00:42.169]  Big Brother.
[00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:43.929]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:45.690]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.290]  You want answers?
[00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.831]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:53.012]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:53.012 --> 00:00:57.114]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:19.252]  There's a very important article up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:01:19.252 --> 00:01:20.312]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:23.595]  Here we are already, closing out the week.
[00:01:23.595 --> 00:01:28.759]  The final broadcast I'm doing in the first week of 2007.
[00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.960]  It is Friday.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.784]  We'll be live for the next three hours and we have three separate guests.
[00:01:35.784 --> 00:01:39.227]  Actually, we have four guests joining us today.
[00:01:39.227 --> 00:01:40.648]  We'll have time to squeeze in a few calls.
[00:01:41.423 --> 00:01:56.890]  As well, there's a really important article up on PrisonPlanet.com, and I talked to Paul Watson about it when the story came out, and I said, Paul, I didn't know about this.
[00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.632]  There was a big bombing in Madrid, Spain.
[00:02:01.632 --> 00:02:03.232]  For some reason, it's not in my stack.
[00:02:03.232 --> 00:02:04.453]  Guys, will you print that for me again?
[00:02:07.541 --> 00:02:26.749]  And I didn't even know, and I'm somewhat of a news junkie scanning around the news wires, and I called a few people in my family, I talked to people here at the office, none of them, some of them are total news junkies, addicts, had heard of this.
[00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:32.732]  I mean, a giant bomb went off and wreaked incredible havoc
[00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:40.393]  But when they don't want to make a big deal out of it, it's kept quiet.
[00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:44.976]  So I'll get into that report a little bit later.
[00:02:44.976 --> 00:02:58.025]  Something else that's kept quiet is what's happening on the Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Californian borders with good ol' Mexico.
[00:02:58.025 --> 00:03:00.887]  And that is that Mexican troops come across routinely
[00:03:02.854 --> 00:03:14.378]  And FBI agents have been killed, have been wounded, DEA have been killed and been wounded, sheriff's deputies have been killed and wounded, have been held up at gunpoint, have been robbed.
[00:03:14.378 --> 00:03:16.639]  Mexican troops have come across the border in Texas.
[00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:23.882]  We've interviewed the sheriff who was there when it happened and pointed machine guns at him and took the marijuana back.
[00:03:23.882 --> 00:03:27.063]  The Mexican troops take large payments from the illegal aliens.
[00:03:28.085 --> 00:03:36.146]  And act as coyotes using their army trucks in many cases to drive across the border or to drive around border patrol to deliver them to U.S.
[00:03:36.146 --> 00:03:37.547]  soil.
[00:03:37.547 --> 00:03:43.008]  Of course, the AP reported yesterday the Mexican government in connection, in conjunction with the U.S.
[00:03:43.008 --> 00:03:52.289]  government, since they're working together, is going to pay in an opening program for 200,000 GPS systems to navigate them into the U.S.
[00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:56.310]  And let's say that the cheapest GPS I ever heard of, let's say 50 bucks a piece,
[00:03:56.954 --> 00:04:02.976]  We're talking about tens of millions of dollars.
[00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:08.058]  And of course there's the comic books that say this is Mexico and that the U.S.
[00:04:08.058 --> 00:04:11.120]  belongs to Mexico, come get it.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:24.265]  Aslan, the mythical kingdom, and it tells in there, don't beat your wife by the way, the Americans get really mad at that, how to stay under the radar, how to sneak in, what to do, how to get on welfare.
[00:04:26.408 --> 00:04:44.214]  So we have a country of 100 million people literally attached to us, pumping in 30 million of their population, using us as a revolutionary steam valve, because they would have no doubt had a revolution down there, probably with a good outcome, certainly possibly with a good outcome, if they hadn't used the US as a steam valve.
[00:04:45.988 --> 00:04:55.375]  And you have tens of billions a year being sent back just from their paychecks, not to mention the tens of billions being sent back that's siphoned through all the welfare fraud.
[00:04:55.375 --> 00:04:59.297]  There is no federal or state enforcement to stop fraud.
[00:04:59.297 --> 00:05:05.482]  Some of these people, in cases when they have been caught, have had seven different identities.
[00:05:05.482 --> 00:05:11.286]  Seven different identities pulling seven different welfare checks.
[00:05:11.286 --> 00:05:13.387]  But I'm going to lay all this out.
[00:05:13.387 --> 00:05:14.168]  And why?
[00:05:16.108 --> 00:05:21.371]  U.S.-Mexico pact revealed billions to non-citizens, but we mentioned that a few days ago.
[00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:25.614]  No, no, it's happened again.
[00:05:25.614 --> 00:05:30.156]  Gunmen force guard troops to flee border patrol posts.
[00:05:30.156 --> 00:05:33.278]  That's the Americans' land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:43.174]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:43.174 --> 00:05:45.476]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:45.476 --> 00:05:53.122]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:53.795 --> 00:06:01.257]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:01.257 --> 00:06:12.980]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.940]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.201]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:19.201 --> 00:06:23.042]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.203]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:36.124]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:36.124 --> 00:07:36.905]  It's a fact.
[00:07:36.905 --> 00:07:41.788]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:07:41.788 --> 00:07:47.271]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:50.713]  So why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours?
[00:07:50.713 --> 00:07:57.837]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[00:07:58.177 --> 00:08:05.825]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[00:08:05.825 --> 00:08:08.107]  We also do credit restoration.
[00:08:08.107 --> 00:08:14.674]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[00:08:14.674 --> 00:08:18.418]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[00:08:18.778 --> 00:08:21.400]  Call Day of Jubilee open 9 a.m.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.280]  to 5 p.m.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.821]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[00:08:23.821 --> 00:08:24.301]  That's 920-293-8024.
[00:08:24.301 --> 00:08:25.322]  And ask for Robert.
[00:08:25.322 --> 00:08:28.283]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[00:08:41.224 --> 00:08:42.525]  Big Brother.
[00:08:42.525 --> 00:08:44.306]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:44.306 --> 00:08:46.067]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:47.628]  You want answers?
[00:08:47.628 --> 00:08:49.190]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:53.372]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:53.372 --> 00:09:03.519]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:10.024]  Remember the reporter, Ed Haas?
[00:09:11.707 --> 00:09:30.740]  Who we talked to about a month ago, who had interviewed the Israeli-American, who had reported to the FBI, on record, we confirmed this, months before 9-11, and to hear people in Hebrew talking about when the towers get knocked down in September, the Americans will know what it's like to be hit by a terrorist.
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.442]  And it's on record he went to the FBI.
[00:09:32.442 --> 00:09:35.944]  Well, now more of this story has been confirmed.
[00:09:35.944 --> 00:09:41.288]  I've had a chance to learn the name and get the number of the individual, actually a few weeks ago, I've been so busy I haven't
[00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:45.869]  We're able to follow up on it and get a hold of it in the times I called.
[00:09:45.869 --> 00:09:50.211]  But the individual now has signed more statements to the FBI.
[00:09:50.211 --> 00:09:55.053]  And so we'll give you an update on that in about 22 minutes from now.
[00:09:55.053 --> 00:10:03.135]  Then we've got Webster Tarpley coming on at the bottom of the next hour to talk about Gerald Ford and the Bush connection and some of the current things that are happening.
[00:10:03.135 --> 00:10:07.477]  And then Tony Gosling, who is one of the preeminent experts on the Bilderberg Group,
[00:10:09.133 --> 00:10:13.234]  In the world runs the Big Bilderberg.org website.
[00:10:13.234 --> 00:10:20.757]  He'll be joining us coming up to talk about the Global Elite, what their programs are in the third hour today.
[00:10:20.757 --> 00:10:27.299]  So that's the guest that we have joining us.
[00:10:27.299 --> 00:10:33.420]  In the meantime, forgive me if I'm a bit slow today.
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.661]  I'm still a little bit under the weather.
[00:10:36.898 --> 00:10:49.368]  You may hear me pause from time to time to shelter you from the hacking and snarfing that's going on.
[00:10:49.368 --> 00:11:01.859]  Now, we're also going to be getting into the fact that terror is trivial when it's not Muslims.
[00:11:01.859 --> 00:11:04.541]  Madrid airport bombing received scant attention.
[00:11:06.235 --> 00:11:11.459]  And this happened over the last weekend, but still the average person hasn't heard about it.
[00:11:11.459 --> 00:11:19.624]  So we'll be discussing that a little bit later in this hour.
[00:11:19.624 --> 00:11:25.908]  But it happened again, and it's happened a whole bunch of times, and it never gets the attention it deserves.
[00:11:25.908 --> 00:11:27.089]  Can you imagine
[00:11:29.512 --> 00:11:47.036]  If Arabs shot at Border Patrol, or if Arabs or Muslims shot at National Guard and overran them, the type of hysteria, the type of freaking out... I mean, hide your children, lock your doors.
[00:11:47.036 --> 00:11:52.617]  People would build shrines to SWAT teams with little men in black masks that they would bow down to.
[00:11:52.617 --> 00:11:54.418]  It's nice that we've already gotten to that, but...
[00:11:55.955 --> 00:11:57.737]  Little sacrifices to it.
[00:11:57.737 --> 00:11:59.418]  I mean, that's the point we're getting to.
[00:11:59.418 --> 00:12:01.320]  Where we worship our slavery.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:07.645]  Where we worship the paramilitary forces that rule over us with hate.
[00:12:07.645 --> 00:12:11.669]  But can you imagine, there were fifty... was it four?
[00:12:11.669 --> 00:12:15.072]  Yeah, fifty-four back in 2005.
[00:12:15.072 --> 00:12:22.278]  American citizens, late 2005, kidnapped over the Texas border and taken down to Mexico and held.
[00:12:23.112 --> 00:12:24.313]  And it was kept very quiet.
[00:12:24.313 --> 00:12:32.338]  There was a huge week-long standoff and armed takeover and some of the people got killed.
[00:12:32.338 --> 00:12:39.022]  800 plus dead on the Texas and Mexico sides of the border in 2005.
[00:12:39.022 --> 00:12:41.063]  It was hundreds and hundreds last year.
[00:12:41.063 --> 00:12:46.107]  The State Department reporting that it was more dangerous than the West Bank of Israel.
[00:12:46.107 --> 00:12:51.210]  Its highest threat level warning of not to travel into those areas of South Texas.
[00:12:53.635 --> 00:13:02.737]  There are over a million illegal aliens, conservatively, in Houston alone.
[00:13:02.737 --> 00:13:12.278]  There have been car bombs there, machine gunnings there, a car bombing in Dallas, shootings in Austin, San Antonio.
[00:13:12.278 --> 00:13:20.560]  And, I mean, imagine, trucks blow up and then catch the house on fire next to them and blow people up in them.
[00:13:21.261 --> 00:13:27.104]  And it's just minor footnote on the Dallas Morning News, minor footnote on the nightly news.
[00:13:27.104 --> 00:13:33.547]  You see, they know what to hype, they know what to not hype.
[00:13:33.547 --> 00:13:39.550]  And we've had a bunch of Border Patrol killed and shot, and then always they say, somebody shot them from over the border.
[00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:48.875]  And then always a few weeks later, okay, it was Mexican troops, but they were rogues, and they've been hired by the drug dealers.
[00:13:49.594 --> 00:13:51.275]  Does that mean hired by the generals?
[00:13:51.275 --> 00:13:58.339]  Because everyone knows, it's on record, that every Mexican general is publicly a narcotics trafficker.
[00:13:58.339 --> 00:14:05.523]  The whole government runs the narcotics, and they sell them through certified drug couriers and conduits to U.S.
[00:14:05.523 --> 00:14:09.245]  drug dealers here in the continental U.S.
[00:14:09.245 --> 00:14:17.690]  I mean, all the time I say the government ships in the drugs, and people go, well, I got a cousin that's a drug dealer.
[00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:18.851]  He ain't working for the government.
[00:14:19.835 --> 00:14:23.176]  We're not talking about your small-time dope dealers.
[00:14:23.176 --> 00:14:26.058]  I know, they drive a Cadillac and live in a million dollar house.
[00:14:26.058 --> 00:14:28.959]  They're absolutely nothing, okay?
[00:14:28.959 --> 00:14:33.701]  The real banks that launder the money get over $300 billion a year here in the U.S.
[00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:34.601]  alone.
[00:14:34.601 --> 00:14:36.522]  The major conduits.
[00:14:36.522 --> 00:14:38.503]  Take Columbia.
[00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:42.525]  You will have GPS on the crop spraying aircraft.
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:53.902]  And they will spray certain fields right next to other coca fields, or marijuana fields, or opium plantations, and they will not spray the one right next to it.
[00:14:53.902 --> 00:14:56.902]  It's all, are you paying your cut?
[00:14:56.902 --> 00:14:58.283]  Okay?
[00:14:58.283 --> 00:15:01.543]  So, large portions are directly shipped in on U.S.
[00:15:01.543 --> 00:15:05.424]  government aircraft, trains, and ships.
[00:15:05.424 --> 00:15:06.564]  Then, large U.S.
[00:15:06.564 --> 00:15:11.225]  corporations also ship in large shipments, and they're totally, totally protected.
[00:15:11.838 --> 00:15:21.843]  But then the lion's share of it is coming in through couriers and through other shipments by licensed drug cartels.
[00:15:21.843 --> 00:15:25.104]  And we've had Celica Stillo, a former head D.A.
[00:15:25.104 --> 00:15:26.185]  agent in Latin America.
[00:15:26.185 --> 00:15:29.126]  He'd also been a Marine Corps, excuse me, an Army sniper.
[00:15:30.535 --> 00:15:46.063]  He'd been a police officer, he'd been a border patrol guard, and then moved up into DEA, so worked it all, saying that Los Zetas, the so-called paramilitary Mexican Army drug dealers all over the Southwest, killing whoever they want, including police, by the way.
[00:15:46.063 --> 00:15:51.366]  But again, it's bad when you kill a cop, except when Los Zetas does it, it's kept very quiet.
[00:15:51.366 --> 00:15:55.808]  It's like, eh, cop union, just shut up, okay?
[00:15:55.808 --> 00:15:58.049]  This is the special group, you keep your mouth shut.
[00:15:58.049 --> 00:15:59.490]  You want Los Zetas to come get you.
[00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:11.053]  And they tried to hire Selly's, you know, they train right down there in South Texas, and it's former CIA commandos, still CIA, down there running the whole op.
[00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:27.577]  In fact, Selly told us three years ago, and it came out in the news last year, two years after he reported it, that they were hiring all the former death squad commanders from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Panama, Guatemala, thousands of them, to run the death camps and the extermination squads in Iraq.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:36.585]  Lo and behold, it has now been in the Associated Press, it's been in the big papers out of Caracas, it is admitted.
[00:16:36.585 --> 00:16:50.933]  And now the Boston Globe reports, as well as the Associated Press, that they have huge recruiting stations all over Latin America, and that a large portion of our troops are now foreigners.
[00:16:50.933 --> 00:16:57.817]  Oh, they're breeding and training and preparing hardcore Latin American death squads right here in the U.S.
[00:16:59.022 --> 00:17:04.207]  In fact, if the globalists ever decide to kill me, that's probably who they'll hire to do it.
[00:17:04.207 --> 00:17:07.309]  They don't care, and the cops will lick their boots.
[00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:09.471]  They can kill however many cops they want.
[00:17:09.471 --> 00:17:12.674]  These little cowardly creatures just love it!
[00:17:12.674 --> 00:17:14.756]  They want to pull over old ladies and shake them down.
[00:17:14.756 --> 00:17:17.478]  They don't want to take their body armor off.
[00:17:17.478 --> 00:17:18.919]  Here, shoot me, Mexican troops!
[00:17:18.919 --> 00:17:22.362]  Because they love to cower and listen to Rush Limbaugh.
[00:17:22.362 --> 00:17:26.726]  They love fake conservatism and weakness and lies and the destruction of this country.
[00:17:29.634 --> 00:17:30.674]  Alright, I've been a little mean.
[00:17:30.674 --> 00:17:34.815]  I just want to illustrate how ridiculous all this is.
[00:17:34.815 --> 00:17:37.056]  Cameras in school bathrooms.
[00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:39.236]  Checkpoints all over the country.
[00:17:39.236 --> 00:17:41.417]  The Bush has announced he's reading all our mail.
[00:17:41.417 --> 00:17:42.637]  We already knew this, folks.
[00:17:42.637 --> 00:17:45.157]  They open mail all the time.
[00:17:45.157 --> 00:17:48.418]  Most of the stuff that comes to my house has been opened.
[00:17:48.418 --> 00:17:52.339]  I mean, what do you expect living in a banana republic run by a bunch of gangsters?
[00:17:59.139 --> 00:18:00.839]  And I shouldn't go off about the police.
[00:18:00.839 --> 00:18:03.460]  It's just, so many of them have been killed.
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:09.641]  I mean, some drug dealer or some old lady shoots a cop, man, they act like Jesus died.
[00:18:09.641 --> 00:18:12.462]  But whenever the Mexican troops kill them, it's kept real quiet.
[00:18:12.462 --> 00:18:16.422]  And those cops are told, stick your thumbs in your mouth and suck on them and shut up.
[00:18:16.422 --> 00:18:19.043]  And they say, yes, a boss.
[00:18:19.043 --> 00:18:21.303]  Yes, it's just pathetic.
[00:18:21.303 --> 00:18:22.323]  It's pathetic!
[00:18:26.346 --> 00:18:28.467]  Alright, I'm already burning out all our time.
[00:18:28.467 --> 00:18:31.709]  I need to go over what's happened.
[00:18:31.709 --> 00:18:35.691]  U.S.-Mexico pact revealed billions go to non-citizens.
[00:18:35.691 --> 00:18:40.013]  That's coming up, actually, secondarily.
[00:18:40.013 --> 00:18:41.054]  This is out of the AP.
[00:18:41.054 --> 00:18:44.976]  Government forced guard troops to flee Border Patrol post.
[00:18:44.976 --> 00:18:48.858]  National Guard troops at an observation post at the Mexico border were forced to flee.
[00:18:50.493 --> 00:18:55.376]  A group of armed people, and we've got sources there in Arizona, and it's the same MO.
[00:18:55.376 --> 00:19:00.580]  It's Mexican drug troops that control that area, and the reports are it's Mexican troops.
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:09.886]  Well, again, we've had a sheriff on from South Texas who's had the Mexican troops pull right up, aim guns at them, and take the marijuana away they just seized three miles over the border.
[00:19:09.886 --> 00:19:12.568]  You're not taking our shipment, buddy!
[00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:16.550]  And what did our, what did our, what did the sheriff's deputies do?
[00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:17.471]  I couldn't help myself.
[00:19:18.317 --> 00:19:20.599]  I mean, I would just take cover and open fire on them.
[00:19:20.599 --> 00:19:24.783]  But again, that's not even macho of me.
[00:19:24.783 --> 00:19:29.707]  I mean, you've got foreign troops in your country, your instinct should be to kill them.
[00:19:29.707 --> 00:19:32.950]  If they're aiming guns at you and shooting at you.
[00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:34.432]  But no, not Americans!
[00:19:34.432 --> 00:19:36.013]  Man, we've been trained to lay down.
[00:19:36.013 --> 00:19:41.358]  I was just on a national talk show right before I came on and did this live hour.
[00:19:42.463 --> 00:19:45.185]  And I brought this up, and they said, well, we gotta be nice.
[00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:47.747]  I was talking to one of the producers off air, actually.
[00:19:47.747 --> 00:19:54.272]  They were like, well, you gotta be nice to the illegal aliens.
[00:19:54.272 --> 00:19:59.096]  Gunmen force guard troops to flee border patrol posts.
[00:19:59.096 --> 00:20:07.083]  And you really can't knock the guard because they're not allowed to have loaded weapons.
[00:20:07.083 --> 00:20:08.324]  That's right.
[00:20:08.324 --> 00:20:09.805]  Can't have loaded weapons.
[00:20:10.888 --> 00:20:14.811]  It's the one place you can have troops, constitutionally, is the border.
[00:20:14.811 --> 00:20:15.732]  But, uh, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:20:15.732 --> 00:20:23.898]  We're going to have armed National Guard New Orleans taking little old ladies' guns and shooting American citizens.
[00:20:23.898 --> 00:20:34.767]  But you, uh, the troops who are not allowed to apprehend illegal border crossers withdrew safely and no one was injured, said National Guard Sergeant Edward Valbon.
[00:20:34.767 --> 00:20:35.127]  Okay.
[00:20:36.624 --> 00:20:41.767]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:20:41.767 --> 00:20:49.231]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:20:49.231 --> 00:21:00.057]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:21:00.057 --> 00:21:04.579]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:21:04.879 --> 00:21:10.082]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:21:10.082 --> 00:21:13.244]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:13.244 --> 00:21:23.151]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[00:21:33.539 --> 00:21:45.832]  David J. Smith, did you know that a plan was laid down in the 1870s to conquer the world for world government that has not been deviated from since its inception?
[00:21:45.832 --> 00:21:50.817]  These conspirators said that they must have many revolutionary wars and three world wars.
[00:21:51.517 --> 00:21:58.144]  Have we witnessed these wars of liberation since the 1920s and then World War I and World War II?
[00:21:58.144 --> 00:22:06.652]  The Illuminati, who are worshippers of Lucifer, are now preparing for the final conflict, the Third World War, to produce their One World Government.

[00:22:37.569 --> 00:22:42.311]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:22:42.311 --> 00:22:47.334]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:22:47.334 --> 00:22:50.115]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:22:50.115 --> 00:22:52.557]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:22:52.557 --> 00:22:58.099]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:22:58.099 --> 00:23:05.283]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:23:06.343 --> 00:23:09.645]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[00:23:09.645 --> 00:23:15.988]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[00:23:27.333 --> 00:23:27.773]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:27.773 --> 00:23:27.973]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.743]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:23:40.743 --> 00:23:43.966]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:23:43.966 --> 00:23:53.356]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:23:53.356 --> 00:23:58.222]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.
[00:23:58.883 --> 00:24:09.372]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[00:24:09.372 --> 00:24:12.455]  Star War technology at its best.
[00:24:12.455 --> 00:24:13.716]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:24:13.716 --> 00:24:13.756]  702-953-0267.
[00:24:22.281 --> 00:24:22.921]  The way this works is
[00:24:50.726 --> 00:24:54.127]  The media tells us when to get upset.
[00:24:54.127 --> 00:24:56.708]  Huge bomb goes off at the airport in Madrid.
[00:24:56.708 --> 00:25:05.992]  They don't want the public to know about it, so it's buried in some news wire and no one learns of it for four or five days.
[00:25:05.992 --> 00:25:07.413]  Oh yeah, that's how this operates.
[00:25:07.413 --> 00:25:10.514]  So we have total bedlam on the border.
[00:25:10.514 --> 00:25:13.935]  We have the Mexican radio stations all announcing that this is Mexico.
[00:25:13.935 --> 00:25:16.576]  600 and something billboards saying, L.A.'
[00:25:16.556 --> 00:25:17.957]  's Mexico, ha ha ha.
[00:25:19.764 --> 00:25:22.846]  Federal government finances the whole thing.
[00:25:22.846 --> 00:25:28.848]  Every few months, Mexican troops open fire, wound, or shoot up the vehicles of Border Patrol.
[00:25:28.848 --> 00:25:32.990]  It never makes national news.
[00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:38.433]  And this is how it operates.
[00:25:38.433 --> 00:25:48.718]  Now, up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, we have the actual local newspaper articles that have more details
[00:25:51.008 --> 00:25:54.791]  Of what happened than what the AP reports.
[00:25:54.791 --> 00:26:02.757]  But I'll bet my bottom dollar that these were Mexican troops, because Mexican troops don't let anybody else operate down there.
[00:26:02.757 --> 00:26:06.160]  You pay them the money, they bring you across.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:16.108]  Now you'll have a coyote who's going, who's leading them, but he is shepherded to the border or across the border, and then it's his job to get you to a safe house.
[00:26:16.108 --> 00:26:17.909]  Or to the vans that pick you up on the highway.
[00:26:20.934 --> 00:26:28.098]  And the Border Patrol reports, they catch about one out of ten that come across.
[00:26:28.098 --> 00:26:34.942]  So, if you go read the AP article, gunmen force guard troops to flee border patrol post.
[00:26:34.942 --> 00:26:44.367]  National Guard troops in an observation post near the Mexican border were forced to flee a group of armed people, who later ran into Mexico authorities, said the troops
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:55.763]  Who were not allowed to apprehend illegal border crossers, withdrew safely, and no one was injured, said National Guard Sergeant Edward Balaban.
[00:26:55.763 --> 00:27:01.364]  But can you imagine if our troops were going across the Mexican border shooting at their people and killing their people?
[00:27:01.364 --> 00:27:05.585]  I mean, Mexico would just go into a complete cardiac arrest.
[00:27:08.623 --> 00:27:09.123]  As a U.S.
[00:27:09.123 --> 00:27:14.968]  citizen, you try sneaking across the border down there, boy, they'll put you in prison and suck every dime out of your family.
[00:27:14.968 --> 00:27:18.570]  And it'll be called good by our media.
[00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:18.931]  U.S.
[00:27:18.931 --> 00:27:25.375]  Border Patrol officials are investigating, run by Chertoff, who isn't even American.
[00:27:25.375 --> 00:27:32.561]  Don't you love America where foreigners are our little Nazi viceroys like Chertoff?
[00:27:32.561 --> 00:27:32.821]  U.S.
[00:27:32.821 --> 00:27:35.583]  Border Patrol officials are investigating the 11 p.m.
[00:27:35.583 --> 00:27:36.404]  Wednesday incident
[00:27:36.974 --> 00:27:50.138]  And are trying to determine who the armed people were and why they approached the post near Sossabee in the desert corridor between Nogales and Lukeville.
[00:27:50.138 --> 00:27:59.061]  Balaban, the sergeant, said the troops didn't know how many people were involved because it was so dark.
[00:27:59.061 --> 00:28:03.223]  The area has been the busiest in the Tucson sector for marijuana seizures.
[00:28:03.223 --> 00:28:04.543]  Agents have seized 124,000 pounds of marijuana.
[00:28:07.806 --> 00:28:11.888]  What we need to add to an article we're writing about this is that it first started four years ago.
[00:28:11.888 --> 00:28:16.850]  Remember the bounties on Border Patrol?
[00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:23.093]  And then my dad, whose patient was then the head of the Texas Border Patrol, no longer is, said, is that true?
[00:28:23.093 --> 00:28:26.074]  And he said, oh yeah, that's true.
[00:28:26.074 --> 00:28:28.935]  And he made the joke, you know, it's like $200,000 bounty.
[00:28:28.935 --> 00:28:31.336]  That's a lot more than we're worth.
[00:28:31.336 --> 00:28:32.937]  Like it's funny.
[00:28:32.937 --> 00:28:35.258]  I guess he was just making a joke about it because it's uncomfortable.
[00:28:38.035 --> 00:28:47.337]  And then people tried to deny that, and then they took out ads in Mexican newspapers saying there's bounties on people's heads.
[00:28:47.337 --> 00:28:47.857]  What was it?
[00:28:47.857 --> 00:28:53.078]  One of them was a $20,000 bounty for any dead Border Patrol?
[00:28:53.078 --> 00:28:55.258]  Yeah, that's real neighborly.
[00:28:55.258 --> 00:28:58.319]  The papers take ads.
[00:28:58.319 --> 00:28:59.059]  Imagine U.S.
[00:28:59.059 --> 00:29:02.139]  newspapers.
[00:29:02.139 --> 00:29:06.660]  Imagine the Brownsville paper or the Kingsville paper
[00:29:07.333 --> 00:29:09.976]  In South Texas, taking an ad.
[00:29:09.976 --> 00:29:16.942]  Hey, $20,000 to kill Mexican Border Patrol.
[00:29:16.942 --> 00:29:21.186]  I mean, that's how institutionalized hate of the U.S.
[00:29:21.186 --> 00:29:24.529]  and kill the Yankee is down there.
[00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:28.713]  And I'm sick of it!
[00:29:28.713 --> 00:29:31.836]  And I don't want dumb twit state police pulling me over.
[00:29:32.876 --> 00:29:35.558]  On the side of the highway and wanting to search my vehicle!
[00:29:35.558 --> 00:29:39.382]  That's why I get mad at you, you idiots!
[00:29:39.382 --> 00:29:44.366]  We're getting killed and kidnapped and car bombs are going off, and you idiots!
[00:29:44.366 --> 00:29:47.128]  And I mean you, the whole government!
[00:29:47.128 --> 00:29:50.772]  Well, the people that work for the government are a pack of morons.
[00:29:50.772 --> 00:29:51.953]  I shouldn't, I'm just so mad.
[00:29:51.953 --> 00:29:53.914]  I know most of your awakened are good people.
[00:29:53.914 --> 00:29:57.097]  I'm talking about those that think a checkpoint keeps me safe.
[00:29:57.097 --> 00:29:59.119]  Just stop it!
[00:29:59.119 --> 00:30:00.420]  Stop lying to yourselves!
[00:30:01.289 --> 00:30:02.549]  I'm so mad I can't even think.
[00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:09.871]  When we get back, I'm going to run down a few points that are key concerning how this goes into the whole North American Union system.
[00:30:09.871 --> 00:30:15.092]  And then we'll go to Ed Haas and a lot more.
[00:30:15.092 --> 00:30:18.533]  Big Friday Transmission!
[00:30:18.533 --> 00:30:19.413]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:19.413 --> 00:30:22.934]  I guess I'm American Al Qaeda because I want to control our border.
[00:30:22.934 --> 00:30:27.115]  You're not for Bush, you're against him.
[00:30:27.115 --> 00:30:28.516]  We're on the march.
[00:30:28.516 --> 00:30:30.016]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:33.728]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:37.293 --> 00:30:39.875]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:30:39.875 --> 00:30:42.057]  When was the last time you used pure soap?

[00:31:36.781 --> 00:31:39.702]  Shelly, you look ex... Oh wait, why did you turn that down?
[00:31:39.702 --> 00:31:42.803]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[00:31:42.803 --> 00:31:47.465]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice... Well, what's the bed fan?
[00:31:47.465 --> 00:31:50.166]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[00:31:50.166 --> 00:31:51.387]  I could use something like that.
[00:31:51.387 --> 00:31:53.928]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night.
[00:31:53.928 --> 00:31:56.889]  And you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[00:31:56.889 --> 00:31:58.789]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[00:31:58.789 --> 00:32:01.430]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:02.431]  I guess you're right.
[00:32:02.431 --> 00:32:03.291]  Why don't we try it?
[00:32:03.291 --> 00:32:05.252]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[00:32:05.672 --> 00:32:10.078]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[00:32:10.078 --> 00:32:12.161]  I know where we can get some more information.
[00:32:12.161 --> 00:32:16.746]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[00:32:16.746 --> 00:32:20.271]  The bed fan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.

[00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:24.877]  Are you a hot sleeper?
[00:32:24.877 --> 00:32:26.319]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[00:32:26.319 --> 00:32:27.881]  The BedFan is the answer.
[00:32:27.881 --> 00:32:31.506]  Visit us today at www.bedfan.com.
[00:32:31.506 --> 00:32:34.390]  That's www.bedfan.com.
[00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:36.634]  That's bed, F-A-N, dot com.
[00:32:39.406 --> 00:32:43.747]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:32:43.747 --> 00:32:45.768]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:32:45.768 --> 00:32:52.350]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:58.711]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:32:58.711 --> 00:33:00.552]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[00:33:00.832 --> 00:33:01.192]  I think so.
[00:33:23.337 --> 00:33:24.517]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:33:24.517 --> 00:33:26.818]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll free.
[00:33:26.818 --> 00:33:26.978]  1-866-885-6625.
[00:33:26.978 --> 00:33:27.418]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[00:33:27.418 --> 00:33:27.498]  1-866-885-6625.
[00:33:27.498 --> 00:33:28.518]  Way up north to Alaska.
[00:33:28.518 --> 00:33:29.538]  Way up north to Alaska.
[00:33:29.538 --> 00:33:30.318]  North to Alaska.
[00:33:30.318 --> 00:33:31.299]  Go north for us is home.
[00:33:48.974 --> 00:33:54.296]  North to Alaska, to go north the rush is on.
[00:33:54.296 --> 00:34:04.601]  Big Sam left Seattle in the year of 92, with George Pratt, his partner, and brother Billy, too.
[00:34:05.661 --> 00:34:11.405]  They crossed the Yukon River and found the bonanza gold.
[00:34:11.405 --> 00:34:22.814]  Below that old white mountain, just a little southeast of Nome, Sam crossed the majestic mountains to the palace far below.
[00:34:22.814 --> 00:34:28.498]  He talked to his team of huskies as he mushed on through the snow.
[00:34:28.498 --> 00:34:33.342]  With the northern lights a-runnin' wild in the land of the midnight sun.
[00:34:34.222 --> 00:34:40.005]  Welcome back!
[00:34:40.005 --> 00:35:03.495]  We're going to go to Ed Haas with a big Part 2 report on 9-11 prior knowledge, pointing towards Israeli involvement somehow, and we're very close to getting the individual, the Israeli-American who was an Israeli Defense Force veteran himself, on the broadcast.
[00:35:04.378 --> 00:35:09.341]  It's coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:35:09.341 --> 00:35:17.445]  Look, there's so much I could say about the Mexican troops and the paramilitary drug gangs shooting and killing and kidnapping and doing whatever they want.
[00:35:17.445 --> 00:35:19.926]  In some cases, a thousand miles into U.S.
[00:35:19.926 --> 00:35:20.467]  territory.
[00:35:20.467 --> 00:35:23.328]  I mean, up in Indiana, it's happening.
[00:35:23.328 --> 00:35:25.369]  It's happening in Washington.
[00:35:25.369 --> 00:35:28.291]  It's happening in New York.
[00:35:28.291 --> 00:35:32.733]  And they only put a few hundred National Guard on the border.
[00:35:33.573 --> 00:35:36.775]  When they claimed they were going to build a fence, then they cancelled the fence.
[00:35:36.775 --> 00:35:38.076]  That fence was dead on arrival.
[00:35:38.076 --> 00:35:39.197]  You could read the legislation.
[00:35:39.197 --> 00:35:45.721]  It just said, this legislation allows the federal government, if it wants to, to build fences.
[00:35:45.721 --> 00:35:52.225]  Folks, if the federal bureaucracy that runs things, not Congress, wanted to build a fence, it'd do it.
[00:35:52.225 --> 00:35:57.909]  Of course, Chertoff is killing the fence.
[00:35:57.909 --> 00:36:01.091]  So, that's what's happening, and
[00:36:02.091 --> 00:36:17.015]  We have, uh, our government announcing in an order Bush has issued that Mexican illegal aliens working in this country will be paid Social Security.
[00:36:17.015 --> 00:36:18.155]  You gotta love that.
[00:36:18.155 --> 00:36:22.396]  They're illegal aliens, but the government's gonna mail them Social Security checks.
[00:36:22.396 --> 00:36:23.296]  No questions asked.
[00:36:25.706 --> 00:36:28.087]  They're felons, but that's okay.
[00:36:28.087 --> 00:36:30.027]  And again, they go into the banks.
[00:36:30.027 --> 00:36:30.567]  No.
[00:36:30.567 --> 00:36:32.628]  The AP report, I know Paul's in a story on this.
[00:36:32.628 --> 00:36:33.948]  He's doing a rundown on this.
[00:36:33.948 --> 00:36:34.768]  It needs to be in there.
[00:36:34.768 --> 00:36:36.089]  You need to dig out that AP article.
[00:36:36.089 --> 00:36:37.329]  There were several others.
[00:36:37.329 --> 00:36:42.811]  The headline was something like, Lenders Help Immigrants.
[00:36:42.811 --> 00:36:44.171]  Something like that.
[00:36:44.171 --> 00:36:51.293]  And it went into how 500 big lenders don't ask for ID for housing, car, home loans, bank accounts.
[00:36:53.789 --> 00:36:55.909]  And, you know, I mean, I get mad at the police.
[00:36:55.909 --> 00:36:58.630]  They're just following the bureaucracy's orders.
[00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:00.650]  Really, we should be mad at the New World Order.
[00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:02.291]  We should be mad at the globalists.
[00:37:02.291 --> 00:37:07.311]  They are using the third world population to break down this nation's sovereignty.
[00:37:07.311 --> 00:37:14.653]  To have a voting bloc that will vote for gun control, for breakup of the U.S., for the North American Union.
[00:37:14.653 --> 00:37:20.154]  The $24 billion or $23 billion funded Ford Foundation openly says they want no borders.
[00:37:20.154 --> 00:37:20.694]  The U.N.
[00:37:20.694 --> 00:37:21.734]  says they want no borders.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:44.532]  The Council on Foreign Relations in their SPP.gov agreements that they wrote that have been executed by the executive outside Congress's control state that we're going to have a common border with Mexico and Canada, so the border will be around North America, not national boundaries.
[00:37:44.532 --> 00:37:46.013]  This is all part of the plan.
[00:37:46.013 --> 00:37:50.275]  The Democrats are now in office starting their new legislative session.
[00:37:51.343 --> 00:38:09.086]  And on the top of the agenda amongst restricting free speech and things of that nature, hate crimes laws, is the blanket amnesty known as the Guest Worker Program that legalizes all the illegals and lets corporations bring in unlimited skilled and unskilled workers.
[00:38:09.086 --> 00:38:17.048]  So it won't just legalize all that are here or all that can get here, it will now allow them to bus and fly them in legally.
[00:38:17.048 --> 00:38:18.648]  So it's the end of the border!
[00:38:21.967 --> 00:38:38.357]  And it is encouraged by our narco-terrorist government with the narco-terrorist state of Mexico to keep it quiet that Mexican paramilitary forces, regular army, are attacking and shooting and killing and kidnapping and maiming.
[00:38:38.357 --> 00:38:48.303]  Hell, every few months I read stuff out of South Texas, out of Arizona and Mexico where a dozen homes were burned last night by roving gangs of Mexicans.
[00:38:49.406 --> 00:38:55.813]  Can you imagine if roving gangs of whites were running around burning 12 black houses?
[00:38:55.813 --> 00:38:57.534]  It'd be national news, and it should be!
[00:38:57.534 --> 00:39:04.762]  Can you imagine if whites were out burning Mexicans' houses?
[00:39:04.762 --> 00:39:07.745]  We basically have the plan of San Diego being implemented.
[00:39:07.745 --> 00:39:09.687]  If you don't know what that is, Google it.
[00:39:11.224 --> 00:39:14.465]  On our border, right now, and our government loves it!
[00:39:14.465 --> 00:39:16.066]  They're killing this country!
[00:39:16.066 --> 00:39:21.248]  As David Rockefeller wrote in his memoirs three years ago, that they want to end U.S.
[00:39:21.248 --> 00:39:28.211]  sovereignty by hook or by crook!
[00:39:28.211 --> 00:39:30.712]  And so this is the type of reports I have here in front of me.
[00:39:30.712 --> 00:39:34.634]  U.S.-Mexico pact revealed billions to non-citizens.
[00:39:34.634 --> 00:39:37.535]  Government forced Guard troops to flee Border Patrol post-AP.
[00:39:39.131 --> 00:39:48.415]  Arizona Daily Star, Armed Group Forces Guard to Fleet Post, on border, Mexican soldiers freelancing for drug cartels on U.S.
[00:39:48.415 --> 00:39:52.996]  soil, CNS News, this is a good report.
[00:39:52.996 --> 00:40:04.661]  And again, I've had the sheriff's on, who, two, three miles over the border, Mexican regular army, admin in their army, walk up with machine guns, and say, you will give us the dump truck full of marijuana back, or we're gonna kill you!
[00:40:05.931 --> 00:40:07.272]  And what do our sheriffs say?
[00:40:07.272 --> 00:40:10.995]  They say, yes sir, boss!
[00:40:10.995 --> 00:40:14.058]  How high do you want me to jump?
[00:40:14.058 --> 00:40:16.580]  I'll just go run some checkpoints down the road on citizens.
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:17.381]  They're a bunch of sheep.
[00:40:17.381 --> 00:40:22.766]  They'll put up with it.
[00:40:22.766 --> 00:40:23.466]  Oh, man.
[00:40:23.466 --> 00:40:27.870]  Alright, I'm going to shut up and get our guest.
[00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:32.374]  Later, I'm going to get into the fact that a huge bomb went off in Madrid, Spain over the weekend.
[00:40:33.112 --> 00:40:34.453]  And I've talked to a bunch of people.
[00:40:34.453 --> 00:40:35.534]  Nobody knows about it.
[00:40:35.534 --> 00:40:37.876]  I didn't learn about it until yesterday.
[00:40:37.876 --> 00:40:39.838]  I'm ashamed.
[00:40:39.838 --> 00:40:42.860]  And that's the control of the media.
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:54.310]  There were a bunch of bombings in Asia over the New Years, but because they weren't connected to Muslims, because they were real terrorist attacks, and I'm not saying they're in terrorism, ladies and gents, there's lots of it.
[00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:56.572]  There have been over a hundred terror attacks in the U.S.
[00:40:56.572 --> 00:40:59.674]  the last ten years, but they're never called that.
[00:40:59.674 --> 00:41:01.496]  You talk to any FBI, any police, they'll tell you.
[00:41:02.913 --> 00:41:05.735]  Oh yeah, but we're not allowed to talk about it.
[00:41:05.735 --> 00:41:06.035]  Why?
[00:41:06.035 --> 00:41:10.318]  Because they're real.
[00:41:10.318 --> 00:41:12.900]  And later all that time, I'll get into why that is.
[00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:15.742]  It's so sick.
[00:41:15.742 --> 00:41:18.964]  But boy, when our government does an attack, you're going to hear about it forever.
[00:41:18.964 --> 00:41:20.425]  It's going to be Hollywood.
[00:41:20.425 --> 00:41:25.388]  It's going to be spectacular.
[00:41:25.388 --> 00:41:29.751]  But some bass could blow something up in Spain.
[00:41:29.751 --> 00:41:30.452]  You're not going to hear anything.
[00:41:31.343 --> 00:41:41.092]  Or if something happens over in Thailand, and it's the military out of power doing it to the current military coup, you're not going to hear about it.
[00:41:41.092 --> 00:41:42.714]  Okay.
[00:41:42.714 --> 00:41:44.235]  I appreciate Ed Haas coming on.
[00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:46.838]  I have gotten in contact with the source.
[00:41:46.838 --> 00:41:48.299]  We're vetting all of it.
[00:41:48.299 --> 00:41:50.261]  I think the best thing to do here is just recap.
[00:41:51.474 --> 00:41:56.760]  What the story is, the fact that the guy did go to the FBI, that's on record, he did warn the FBI.
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:09.996]  This isn't just, oh, you know, Alex is reporting on some rumor of some guy that claims he heard people speaking in Hebrew at a Jewish cemetery in New Jersey.
[00:42:11.345 --> 00:42:15.708]  About how the towers were going to get knocked down in September, and then that's all our proof.
[00:42:15.708 --> 00:42:20.611]  We have the FBI letters, the letterhead, the phone calls made to the FBI agents who said they're not allowed to talk about it.
[00:42:20.611 --> 00:42:22.772]  We know he did write these letters to them.
[00:42:22.772 --> 00:42:24.053]  We know they got letters back.
[00:42:24.053 --> 00:42:25.994]  We know he met with FBI.
[00:42:25.994 --> 00:42:29.697]  And now I've talked to the individual.
[00:42:29.697 --> 00:42:31.358]  That is, I've got his name and number.
[00:42:31.358 --> 00:42:31.918]  He's called me.
[00:42:31.918 --> 00:42:33.239]  I've called him and put him on the phone tag.
[00:42:33.239 --> 00:42:34.660]  We're getting him on the show soon.
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:38.302]  Ed Haas has talked to him many times, but I've got his name and all the info now.
[00:42:38.302 --> 00:42:39.643]  Ed Haas, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:42:40.163 --> 00:42:41.644]  Yeah, Alex, thanks a lot.
[00:42:41.644 --> 00:42:42.785]  It's good to be with you again.
[00:42:42.785 --> 00:42:46.148]  You know, we've got links to the Muckraker Report right now up on InfoWars.com.
[00:42:46.148 --> 00:42:51.893]  We're going to clone your story for posterity up on InfoWars, and now you've got the photos of this.
[00:42:51.893 --> 00:42:57.657]  Recap what happened, and then give us the latest update, and how long until we can get this guest on air.
[00:42:57.657 --> 00:42:59.739]  Well, the recap is October of 2000.
[00:42:59.739 --> 00:43:04.723]  This individual's in a cemetery in Elizabeth.
[00:43:05.832 --> 00:43:07.974]  Or Newark, New Jersey.
[00:43:07.974 --> 00:43:12.997]  Apparently it's right on the city line between those two cities.
[00:43:12.997 --> 00:43:14.558]  He's in the cemetery.
[00:43:14.558 --> 00:43:17.100]  He's clipping English ivy.
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:19.561]  He overhears a conversation in Hebrew.
[00:43:19.561 --> 00:43:25.846]  He had described the cemetery logistics to me in my first article.
[00:43:25.846 --> 00:43:33.751]  What he had heard and what he had quoted to me was individual speaking and the statement, the Americans will learn.
[00:43:34.508 --> 00:43:39.250]  What it is to live with terrorists after the planes hit the Twins in September.
[00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:40.711]  This is in October of 2000.
[00:43:40.711 --> 00:43:43.012]  He hears this.
[00:43:43.012 --> 00:43:49.554]  Goes through the process of trying to share this information with the FBI.
[00:43:49.554 --> 00:43:54.316]  He was asking for protection in exchange for this information.
[00:43:54.316 --> 00:43:59.959]  He is former IDF veteran of the Yom Kippur War.
[00:43:59.959 --> 00:44:00.119]  And
[00:44:00.896 --> 00:44:05.019]  He showed me letters that he received from the FBI, which you now have.
[00:44:05.019 --> 00:44:11.605]  He showed me two business cards that the FBI agents left with him.
[00:44:11.605 --> 00:44:13.947]  And, you know, I wrote the first story.
[00:44:13.947 --> 00:44:24.796]  And after I wrote the first story about this information, a reader of the Mockraker Report, who lived up in New York, emailed me and said, I don't live far from the cemetery.
[00:44:24.796 --> 00:44:26.137]  I'm going to go down and take pictures.
[00:44:28.098 --> 00:44:35.087]  Sure enough, there's the English Ivy, there's the wall he was behind when he heard him saying all this, there's everything.
[00:44:35.087 --> 00:44:35.807]  Right.
[00:44:35.807 --> 00:44:45.438]  And my point in the second article is, there were definitely some critics and naysayers on the first article, and my point in the second article is,
[00:44:48.274 --> 00:45:04.361]  Anybody who wanted to make up a story like this, certainly I'll concede that if they were really planning this thing out, I guess you could go to a cemetery or you could pick any location and use it as your backdrop.
[00:45:04.361 --> 00:45:10.944]  But I ask questions in the second article like, you know, why make it about English Ivy?
[00:45:10.944 --> 00:45:14.726]  You know, if you're going to create a hoax, who thinks about saying
[00:45:16.078 --> 00:45:18.379]  He's an American Jewish person.
[00:45:18.379 --> 00:45:19.919]  He was in a Jewish cemetery.
[00:45:19.919 --> 00:45:22.600]  Why make it about English Ivy?
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.361]  I talk about the business cards.
[00:45:24.361 --> 00:45:31.403]  Some people on the first article said, well, anybody create FBI business cards.
[00:45:31.403 --> 00:45:32.343]  And that's true.
[00:45:32.343 --> 00:45:34.024]  But you call the FBI!
[00:45:34.024 --> 00:45:34.924]  Right, right.
[00:45:34.924 --> 00:45:39.685]  I saw the pieces attacking your piece, but they didn't legitimately go, you could fake those cards.
[00:45:39.685 --> 00:45:44.347]  You could fake... We posted the cards with the numbers, with the FBI letters.
[00:45:45.226 --> 00:45:53.753]  What's interesting about the cards, Alex, is the cards, each card that was left with him, the phone numbers had changed.
[00:45:53.753 --> 00:45:59.818]  And so they crossed out the last four digits of their phone number and wrote in the correct number.
[00:45:59.818 --> 00:46:02.320]  We see that on business cards all the time.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:05.302]  And then each, but each handwriting is different.
[00:46:05.302 --> 00:46:11.988]  And so my argument to people is, you know, if I'm going to create a fake card of two individuals, fake business cards,
[00:46:12.818 --> 00:46:24.030]  You have to be a pathological liar, in my opinion, to say, let's make it more authentic by changing the phone numbers and have two different individuals write those numbers.
[00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:25.732]  But I mean, Ed, let me stop you.
[00:46:25.732 --> 00:46:29.015]  This is the way the internet works, and that's fine, because people need it.
[00:46:29.838 --> 00:46:35.219]  But the criticisms of your story really weren't legitimate, so I don't even know why we're spending time on it.
[00:46:35.219 --> 00:46:37.100]  I mean, we can do that.
[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:54.224]  I mean, look, I can put a video up or link to a video of Dick Cheney saying he's a CFR former chairman, saying that he kept it secret from his constituents, and people say that it's a fake video and Dick Cheney was never a member when he's listed as a member and a former co-chairman on their website.
[00:46:54.224 --> 00:46:55.505]  So, I mean, let me stop you.
[00:46:57.054 --> 00:46:59.235]  You know, it's like Police State 2000.
[00:46:59.235 --> 00:47:13.503]  I went and videotaped Marines trying to take our guns, admitting it was for American citizens, the Coronado troop ship coming in, hovercraft landing, armored vehicles, tanks, helicopters, and people still say it's fake and isn't real.
[00:47:13.503 --> 00:47:16.945]  You can go to the Marine Corps' website and see their own photos where they talk about it.
[00:47:17.666 --> 00:47:23.990]  I did a Freedom of Information Act request and I got a response from the FBI and it was pretty quick.
[00:47:35.655 --> 00:47:42.278]  Well, I mean, regardless, the FBI admits they talked to this guy, they just won't say why, and they won't talk about the case.
[00:47:42.278 --> 00:47:46.000]  Again, you called the FBI, now you've got letters from the FBI.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.340]  I don't know what people are looking for.
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:49.461]  Right.
[00:47:49.461 --> 00:48:00.426]  Well, they asked for a waiver, a privacy waiver from the individual, the source of this information, and I called him up and said, would you be willing to sign a privacy waiver?
[00:48:00.956 --> 00:48:10.658]  That allows the FBI to release any documentation that they may have with your name on it, related to this story.
[00:48:10.658 --> 00:48:11.658]  He said yes.
[00:48:11.658 --> 00:48:19.840]  I mailed him the waiver form, he signed it, he mailed it right back to me, and I've now forwarded that waiver to the FBI.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:27.422]  So, I'm prepared, if necessary, to go to court with the FBI to get these documents, because I believe they exist.
[00:48:28.317 --> 00:48:31.319]  Well, regardless, the FBI wrote these letters.
[00:48:31.319 --> 00:48:32.799]  They admit these letters are real.
[00:48:32.799 --> 00:48:34.400]  The business cards are real.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.441]  You called the FBI.
[00:48:35.441 --> 00:48:38.062]  The agents did work there at the time.
[00:48:38.062 --> 00:48:40.023]  This guy is scared for his life.
[00:48:40.023 --> 00:48:41.144]  He should be.
[00:48:41.144 --> 00:48:43.265]  He heard this, he's saying.
[00:48:43.265 --> 00:48:46.727]  And, you know, I'd give the story a 95% credibility rating.
[00:48:46.727 --> 00:48:53.570]  There's a small chance it could be some elaborate disinfo, but why would Israel want to put out info that they were involved?
[00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:54.971]  That they wouldn't!
[00:48:54.971 --> 00:48:56.672]  They would want the complete opposite, Ed!
[00:48:57.927 --> 00:49:00.148]  I mean, I don't like particularly reporting this story.
[00:49:00.148 --> 00:49:02.749]  You get a lot of heat doing stuff like this.
[00:49:02.749 --> 00:49:05.850]  But, you know, we've got to because it's got so much credibility.
[00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:08.171]  And I've been watching you for a couple years, Ed.
[00:49:08.171 --> 00:49:10.252]  You've done a lot of good, serious reporting yourself.
[00:49:10.928 --> 00:49:11.668]  Thank you.
[00:49:11.668 --> 00:49:13.809]  I'm anxious for you to talk to the individual.
[00:49:13.809 --> 00:49:16.850]  I mean, the thing that's impressed me about him the most, Alex,
[00:49:36.071 --> 00:49:39.954]  is anytime we talk about this in great length.
[00:49:39.954 --> 00:49:43.657]  Some of our calls are short, some of them are pretty long.
[00:49:43.657 --> 00:49:48.380]  He still feels terrible because he feels as though he could have stopped it.
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:50:00.249]  Now let's be clear, he went to the FBI three separate times, he got a visit from them, and he kept telling them about what he saw, what he heard, and they did nothing.
[00:50:00.249 --> 00:50:02.531]  And now you talk to the FBI agent
[00:50:03.238 --> 00:50:08.361]  You talked to the female agent and she told you that she can't talk, she'd get in trouble.
[00:50:08.361 --> 00:50:09.742]  Repeat that conversation.
[00:50:09.742 --> 00:50:12.463]  Tell us, tell the listeners her name again.
[00:50:12.463 --> 00:50:26.530]  Her name is Robin Gritz and I called her directly and in about a five day span I was making a lot of quick phone calls to the FBI and I decided to call her directly.
[00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:31.493]  And when I finally got her on the phone, it had only been five days since my first inquiry,
[00:50:32.442 --> 00:50:58.963]  uh... at the north division and she now works headquarters fbi and i got on the phone and she was and she said there are two meetings about this and that she was a lot of talker she get a little they're having a meeting she knew about my inquiries because she she when i asked i introduced myself she said i believe our our uh... public affairs offices taking care of this for you i said well i just decided to call you directly and that's what she said
[00:51:00.166 --> 00:51:02.087]  I am unable to talk to you about this.
[00:51:02.087 --> 00:51:04.528]  I would get in trouble.
[00:51:04.528 --> 00:51:07.150]  That is, that is smoking gun right there.
[00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:07.950]  Yeah.
[00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:10.872]  I mean, that is, because the FBI will tell you if there's been a case.
[00:51:10.872 --> 00:51:13.013]  No, we don't have a case with this individual.
[00:51:13.013 --> 00:51:14.614]  We do.
[00:51:14.614 --> 00:51:20.657]  Well, now you've given them the release, for them to release his personal info.
[00:51:20.657 --> 00:51:22.077]  Stay there, Ed Haas.
[00:51:22.077 --> 00:51:23.498]  I will.
[00:51:23.498 --> 00:51:24.919]  Part two of the report, photos.
[00:51:25.991 --> 00:51:29.853]  of the cemetery and a lot more are up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:51:29.853 --> 00:51:32.595]  We've got a link to the Muckraker Report as well.
[00:51:32.595 --> 00:51:34.315]  This is an important story.
[00:51:34.315 --> 00:51:36.677]  That's why we're covering it.
[00:51:36.677 --> 00:51:40.438]  It's here.
[00:51:40.438 --> 00:51:45.601]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:45.601 --> 00:51:53.225]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:53.911 --> 00:52:01.374]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:52:01.374 --> 00:52:13.118]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:52:13.118 --> 00:52:17.080]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.320]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:23.162]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.681]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:52:39.681 --> 00:52:44.863]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:44.863 --> 00:52:49.505]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:49.505 --> 00:52:58.628]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:58.628 --> 00:53:02.229]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:53:02.529 --> 00:53:07.858]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:53:07.858 --> 00:53:14.550]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:53:15.071 --> 00:53:16.372]  What about you?
[00:53:16.372 --> 00:53:21.778]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:53:44.570 --> 00:53:48.112]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[00:54:53.485 --> 00:54:57.347]  You know, we followed up the dancing Israeli story.
[00:54:57.347 --> 00:55:01.991]  I had the police chief on who had them arrested.
[00:55:01.991 --> 00:55:04.853]  And he didn't want to... I got him on about one subject.
[00:55:04.853 --> 00:55:08.275]  He also believes Americans should be forced to take microchips.
[00:55:08.275 --> 00:55:09.616]  Remember that, folks?
[00:55:09.616 --> 00:55:13.979]  And then I got him on for that subject and brought up the Israeli story with him.
[00:55:13.979 --> 00:55:19.503]  And all I've ever said is, Israel couldn't carry out the entire operation.
[00:55:19.503 --> 00:55:21.464]  That'd be like if four guys robbed a bank.
[00:55:22.934 --> 00:55:29.822]  And, you know, I'm saying there was a British guy, an American guy, an Israeli guy there, and somebody else.
[00:55:29.822 --> 00:55:35.609]  And somebody goes, wait, you're giving the American a pass, you're giving the Israeli a pass.
[00:55:35.609 --> 00:55:37.310]  We don't give anybody a pass.
[00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:39.493]  We're going to what the facts show.
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:45.264]  Clearly Dick Cheney was in control and ordered NORAD to stand down.
[00:55:45.264 --> 00:55:49.047]  Clearly two months before he took the power of the generals to shoot aircraft down away.
[00:55:49.047 --> 00:55:59.537]  Clearly Bush had troops massed in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in the months before with the launch order to attack Afghanistan on his desk the day before Newsweek reported, September 10th.
[00:56:00.845 --> 00:56:01.926]  And hundreds of other points.
[00:56:01.926 --> 00:56:04.988]  The White House called Mayor Willie Brown, told him not to fly.
[00:56:04.988 --> 00:56:07.149]  FAA called Salman Rushdie, told him not to fly.
[00:56:07.149 --> 00:56:14.353]  The CIA was running drills with NORAD of flying hijacked jets in the World Trade Center and Pentagon that morning.
[00:56:14.353 --> 00:56:20.617]  FEMA was running tripod 2 drill with building 7, moving the command center out to the end of the pier that day.
[00:56:20.617 --> 00:56:21.717]  Hundreds of other points.
[00:56:21.717 --> 00:56:26.100]  That's all we're saying is that these global agencies are all together.
[00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:32.432]  Criminal elements in a pyramidal structure nexus at the top.
[00:56:32.432 --> 00:56:41.055]  And clearly Odigo, Instant Message Service, admits that they gave the call hours before to get their employees out from Tel Aviv to New York.
[00:56:41.055 --> 00:56:42.696]  We reported on that.
[00:56:42.696 --> 00:56:45.317]  Put it in my films.
[00:56:45.317 --> 00:56:47.297]  So this is what the new order tries to do.
[00:56:47.297 --> 00:56:49.178]  They try to get you to say it's one group or the other.
[00:56:50.208 --> 00:57:00.430]  You know, it's either the Jews, or the Catholics, or it's the Protestants, or it's the devil cult, or it's the... No, it's evil people from each group working together in the New World Order structure.
[00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:17.554]  But they... The globalists, though, want to make it all about a specific group, racially, or ethnically, or religiously, so that they can then either just demonize that one group, and then minimize the effect of the whole structure being defeated.
[00:57:18.567 --> 00:57:19.287]  All right.
[00:57:19.287 --> 00:57:22.028]  Going back to Ed Haas, who I appreciate coming on with this.
[00:57:22.028 --> 00:57:26.190]  Ed, I think it's an important story, and I've looked at it carefully.
[00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:29.891]  If it is disinfo, it's pointless for the establishment.
[00:57:29.891 --> 00:57:34.072]  This guy is on record contacting the FBI and telling them this before.
[00:57:34.072 --> 00:57:38.794]  Why on earth would they want this out there if it was disinfo, Ed Haas?
[00:57:38.794 --> 00:57:45.216]  I agree with you 100% with what you just described, and I try to articulate that in this article.
[00:57:45.216 --> 00:57:46.777]  This is about prior knowledge.
[00:57:47.222 --> 00:57:49.644]  This isn't the only case of prior knowledge.
[00:57:49.644 --> 00:57:54.948]  You just rattled off 25 examples of prior knowledge.
[00:57:54.948 --> 00:58:00.872]  You know, my argument always is prior knowledge means, at minimum, criminally negligent homicide.
[00:58:00.872 --> 00:58:07.917]  You know, if you have prior knowledge of something that's going to happen, that's going to endanger or kill people, and you do nothing with it,
[00:58:08.411 --> 00:58:13.155]  There's laws on the books that say that's illegal.
[00:58:13.155 --> 00:58:19.900]  This is about prior knowledge and who had prior knowledge and who profited from it.
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:27.946]  And you just listed so many examples of prior knowledge and you know sometimes I get frustrated because I sit here and go, why?
[00:58:27.946 --> 00:58:28.987]  What is it?
[00:58:28.987 --> 00:58:35.392]  What is it about our system now that's preventing real criminal investigation and people
[00:58:36.574 --> 00:58:47.849]  I always tell, you know, I make the argument if you and I had this information and it was revealed, this prior knowledge information, the government would have us in jail.
[00:58:49.283 --> 00:58:53.505]  Mosawi's in prison for prior knowledge, the alleged 20th hijacker.
[00:58:53.505 --> 00:58:57.747]  They got him on so-called prior knowledge.
[00:58:57.747 --> 00:59:06.790]  The evidence in his case seems pretty minuscule to the evidence that the American people have on the real prior knowledge of this event.
[00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:07.611]  Exactly.
[00:59:07.611 --> 00:59:08.911]  Stay there, Ed.
[00:59:08.911 --> 00:59:09.431]  70-second break.
[00:59:09.431 --> 00:59:12.653]  We'll come right back to you for five more minutes to finish up.
[00:59:12.653 --> 00:59:13.333]  We'll be right back.
[00:59:16.722 --> 00:59:21.036]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:59:26.491 --> 00:59:29.832]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:59:29.832 --> 00:59:34.993]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:59:34.993 --> 00:59:39.654]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:59:39.654 --> 00:59:48.776]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:59:48.776 --> 00:59:52.377]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:59:52.677 --> 00:59:59.219]  The KDF Shower Filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever color it is used in.
[00:59:59.219 --> 01:00:01.440]  Iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.740]  What about you?
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:08.162]  Order your KDF Shower Filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:00:25.402 --> 01:00:27.804]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:27.804 --> 01:00:37.091]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:37.091 --> 01:00:38.392]  Big Brother.
[01:00:38.392 --> 01:00:40.153]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:40.153 --> 01:00:41.914]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:41.914 --> 01:00:43.496]  You want answers?
[01:00:43.496 --> 01:00:45.057]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:45.057 --> 01:00:49.240]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.582]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:52.461 --> 01:00:58.225]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:58.225 --> 01:01:01.748]  We are now into hour number two.
[01:01:01.748 --> 01:01:15.278]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, Webster Griffin Tarpley will be joining us to give us an overview of what's happening in world events from his perspective with Iran, the economy, and Gerald Ford's connection to the Bushes and the crime syndicate that took over when they stabbed Nixon in the back.
[01:01:16.207 --> 01:01:20.290]  And then in the third hour, Tony Gosling, expert on the Bilderberg Group, will be joining us.
[01:01:20.290 --> 01:01:23.332]  Ed Haas is with us for the next four minutes or so.
[01:01:23.332 --> 01:01:43.907]  Ed, at the Muckraker Report, wrote a great report about an Israeli-American who, for at least six months before the 9-11 attacks, on record reported to the FBI that he heard men speaking in Hebrew at a cemetery behind a wall, talking about how when the towers get knocked down in September, the Americans will know what it's like to be hit by terrorists,
[01:01:45.078 --> 01:01:46.239]  And it went on from there.
[01:01:46.239 --> 01:01:48.460]  Now, we've called the FBI.
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:50.281]  They won't talk about it.
[01:01:50.281 --> 01:01:53.082]  He's done a four-year request.
[01:01:53.082 --> 01:01:55.123]  But we've got the letters from them.
[01:01:55.123 --> 01:01:57.805]  They won't deny that that's their letters to this man.
[01:01:57.805 --> 01:02:03.888]  If this story is real, which all the evidence indicates it is, it is a big story, and that's why we're covering it.
[01:02:03.888 --> 01:02:11.632]  And that's why the feds out there that pose as the anti-Zionist are very upset about this report.
[01:02:12.632 --> 01:02:18.636]  Okay, because their real job is meant to make anybody who criticizes Israel look like a complete idiot.
[01:02:18.636 --> 01:02:21.677]  That's why everything they write sounds completely nutty and paranoid.
[01:02:21.677 --> 01:02:23.979]  That's why they attack all these innocent people.
[01:02:23.979 --> 01:02:29.822]  This is very sophisticated stuff that we're up against, but the good news is people are seeing right through it.
[01:02:29.822 --> 01:02:30.703]  I want to make it clear.
[01:02:30.703 --> 01:02:36.226]  I believe that elements of Shin Bet and Mossad were involved in 9-11.
[01:02:36.226 --> 01:02:40.829]  Now, the disinfo groups out there want you to think it was either one group or the other.
[01:02:41.457 --> 01:02:50.904]  No, it's like if four guys rob the bank and one of them is an Israeli, he's just as guilty for being involved in the conspiracy as the other three parties.
[01:02:50.904 --> 01:02:53.106]  But no, they would claim that if you say the U.S.
[01:02:53.106 --> 01:02:59.991]  government's involved in any way, which they're clearly involved in more than any other group, then you're somehow covering up.
[01:02:59.991 --> 01:03:03.413]  No, we're going after all the evidence.
[01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:09.618]  The last three minutes we've got left, Ed, close up with any other key info on your part two of the story that's now up on your site.
[01:03:11.084 --> 01:03:21.669]  It's important for everybody to, and you mentioned this earlier in this segment, is that there's good people and bad people in every culture.
[01:03:21.669 --> 01:03:34.696]  And I, too, am not going to steer away from any story or any evidence because it might look badly on one particular group.
[01:03:34.696 --> 01:03:40.579]  What frustrates me is, you know, we can write about the mafia, and we can
[01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:46.032]  We've been taught this association of Italians and Mafia.
[01:03:46.032 --> 01:03:50.714]  But when we hear that story, we don't say, oh, Italians are members of Mafia.
[01:03:50.714 --> 01:04:03.678]  And it's interesting, whenever something is, you know, just saying that a conversation was overheard in Hebrew, the conclusion is that, you know, I'm saying Israel did it.
[01:04:03.678 --> 01:04:05.378]  And that's just nuts.
[01:04:05.378 --> 01:04:10.500]  I mean, there are elements, bad elements of people,
[01:04:11.418 --> 01:04:17.940]  And I agree with you, all these intelligence apparatuses around the world, they are interwoven.
[01:04:18.644 --> 01:04:22.727]  And they work together, and that doesn't mean that Israel did 9-11.
[01:04:22.727 --> 01:04:27.871]  It just means that some people that spoke in Hebrew had prior knowledge of 9-11.
[01:04:27.871 --> 01:04:29.292]  And it doesn't mean the U.S.
[01:04:29.292 --> 01:04:30.653]  government itself did it.
[01:04:30.653 --> 01:04:35.636]  What we always say, criminal elements working in unison against the people.
[01:04:35.636 --> 01:04:45.824]  And then, by telling the truth, we can get Jews, Catholics, Americans, Germans on board against the crime syndicate instead of doing what the establishment wants
[01:04:46.564 --> 01:04:52.270]  Making it racial, or trying to blame one group, then they can come in and neutralize us.
[01:04:52.270 --> 01:04:53.311]  Absolutely right.
[01:04:53.311 --> 01:04:55.152]  Absolutely right.
[01:04:55.152 --> 01:04:59.336]  And that's what I try to convey, and readers have to understand that.
[01:04:59.336 --> 01:05:01.898]  Well, Ed, I know you've gotten it from both sides.
[01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:11.027]  Either those saying somehow this is covering up for Israel, that's really middle gymnastics, or those saying you're attacking Israel, and all you're doing is getting a story, you call the FBI,
[01:05:12.210 --> 01:05:14.132]  You've confirmed the story so far.
[01:05:14.132 --> 01:05:15.453]  It's admitted that he talked to them.
[01:05:15.453 --> 01:05:17.736]  They just won't say what about.
[01:05:17.736 --> 01:05:18.997]  He's on record warning them.
[01:05:18.997 --> 01:05:19.938]  This is a big story.
[01:05:19.938 --> 01:05:21.760]  That's muckrecordreport.com.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.521]  Links to it on infowars.com.
[01:05:23.521 --> 01:05:24.683]  We'll talk to you soon, Ed.
[01:05:24.683 --> 01:05:26.645]  Let me talk to you real fast during the break.
[01:05:26.645 --> 01:05:26.825]  Okay.
[01:05:35.862 --> 01:05:41.693]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:41.693 --> 01:05:49.326]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:50.003 --> 01:05:57.467]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:57.467 --> 01:06:09.194]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:06:09.194 --> 01:06:13.156]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:06:13.156 --> 01:06:15.418]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:06:15.418 --> 01:06:19.200]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:06:33.399 --> 01:06:34.740]  Good morning, honey.
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:40.983]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation.
[01:06:40.983 --> 01:06:42.004]  Yeah.
[01:06:42.004 --> 01:06:43.785]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[01:06:43.785 --> 01:06:47.647]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[01:06:47.647 --> 01:06:49.588]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[01:06:49.588 --> 01:06:51.689]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[01:06:51.689 --> 01:06:53.430]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:54.912]  Honey, cheer up!
[01:06:54.912 --> 01:06:57.454]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[01:06:57.454 --> 01:06:58.195]  What?
[01:06:58.195 --> 01:07:08.967]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[01:07:08.967 --> 01:07:13.813]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[01:07:14.133 --> 01:07:15.394]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[01:07:29.461 --> 01:07:32.243]  Travel Berkey not available in Iowa.
[01:07:32.243 --> 01:07:33.183]  Attention!
[01:07:33.183 --> 01:07:34.724]  Attention everyone!
[01:07:34.724 --> 01:07:37.245]  A brand new invention just released.
[01:07:37.245 --> 01:07:38.986]  It's called Wristease.
[01:07:38.986 --> 01:07:41.948]  The new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[01:07:42.603 --> 01:07:49.970]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[01:07:49.970 --> 01:08:03.302]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[01:08:03.302 --> 01:08:07.266]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[01:08:07.726 --> 01:08:18.191]  Wristease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[01:08:18.191 --> 01:08:21.593]  You can order Wristease now at Wristease.com.
[01:08:21.593 --> 01:08:23.233]  That's Wristease.
[01:08:23.233 --> 01:08:28.356]  W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E Wristease.com.
[01:08:28.356 --> 01:08:30.977]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[01:08:33.746 --> 01:08:40.392]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:40.392 --> 01:08:50.340]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:54.884]  We got Tony Gosling, who's got the website Bilderberg.org.
[01:08:54.884 --> 01:08:56.485]  He's been running it for many years.
[01:08:56.485 --> 01:08:59.788]  It's really the definitive site on it.
[01:08:59.788 --> 01:09:01.950]  I'm making a film about Bilderberg Group.
[01:09:03.152 --> 01:09:09.057]  Well, more than just Bilderberg, the Global Masters right now.
[01:09:09.057 --> 01:09:16.683]  And we'll be picking his brain about Diana, about Prince Charles, about the New World Order system coming up the next hour.
[01:09:16.683 --> 01:09:31.555]  In about 25 minutes, we've got a short half-hour interview with Webster Griffin Tarpley coming up with a world overview in 2007, and also the coup d'etat that the Bush crime syndicate ran when they overthrew Nixon in 1974 and brought in the late Gerald
[01:09:32.362 --> 01:09:35.283]  Ford, so that's coming up.
[01:09:35.283 --> 01:09:49.146]  We've got a short interview here with Marty from Calvin Soap here in just a second, then I'll get into the big bombing, bombings, both in Asia and of course in Europe in the last week.
[01:09:49.146 --> 01:09:54.788]  We heard some about the stuff in Thailand, but almost nothing about what happened in Madrid last Saturday.
[01:09:54.788 --> 01:09:56.268]  So that's coming up.
[01:09:57.216 --> 01:10:04.101]  Right now, Marty from Calbin Soap joins us, but I first want to say this before we bring Marty up.
[01:10:04.101 --> 01:10:06.202]  I turn down advertisers every single day.
[01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:21.293]  I mean, we get tons of advertising requests here, and I mean, for all I know, some machine that sends out some wavelength that's going to heal you might work, but if I can't prove it works, if I don't know somebody it's worked on, I'm not going to endorse it.
[01:10:21.293 --> 01:10:23.875]  Or for all I know, some cream might get rid of wrinkles.
[01:10:24.761 --> 01:10:30.805]  Well, for all I know, some pill might get rid of, you know, problems.
[01:10:30.805 --> 01:10:35.729]  But if I don't know it works, and if I don't know it's a good deal, I mean, take fish oil.
[01:10:35.729 --> 01:10:37.650]  We got a link to people that sell fish oil.
[01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:41.113]  I know fish oil is really good for you, so I promote it.
[01:10:41.113 --> 01:10:42.413]  Okay?
[01:10:42.413 --> 01:10:44.035]  I mean, really, I'm into simple things.
[01:10:44.035 --> 01:10:46.456]  High-quality, made-in-America water filters.
[01:10:46.456 --> 01:10:48.898]  Documentary films.
[01:10:48.898 --> 01:10:51.620]  I promote things that I know are real.
[01:10:53.383 --> 01:11:01.728]  And I'm not saying other people's push isn't real, I'm just not going to sit here and endorse it.
[01:11:01.728 --> 01:11:05.570]  Most of you already know the story, but I want to tell it again.
[01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:18.677]  About two and a half years ago, there was a sponsor on the Genesis Network, Calvin Pure Soap, and somehow Marty had heard that I had the biggest show on the network, so he sent me a year's supply of soap.
[01:11:19.995 --> 01:11:22.257]  And the stuff ran out in about a year and a half.
[01:11:22.257 --> 01:11:24.780]  And my wife said, I want more of that.
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.461]  I don't have the box anymore.
[01:11:26.461 --> 01:11:27.262]  Get me more.
[01:11:27.262 --> 01:11:29.244]  And I said, she said, where do I buy it?
[01:11:29.244 --> 01:11:30.925]  And I said, all the networks send it.
[01:11:30.925 --> 01:11:32.266]  You like it?
[01:11:32.266 --> 01:11:34.368]  And she said, oh yeah, I've been using it for shampoo.
[01:11:34.368 --> 01:11:35.309]  I've been using the bar soap.
[01:11:35.309 --> 01:11:36.670]  You know that bar soap smells so good.
[01:11:36.670 --> 01:11:38.792]  I've been using it on the clothes.
[01:11:38.792 --> 01:11:43.176]  We've got to be real careful or the kids will break out if we use chemical detergents.
[01:11:43.176 --> 01:11:44.738]  So we ordered some more.
[01:11:46.195 --> 01:11:53.619]  And then I just thought, you know, this stuff's so good, and it's so cheap, I ought to call him up and say, why don't you sponsor the show?
[01:11:53.619 --> 01:11:58.422]  So I did, and Marty said, yeah, that's why I sent you this up, I thought you'd like it.
[01:11:58.422 --> 01:12:02.424]  And sure enough, you know, two years later, he ended up being a sponsor.
[01:12:02.424 --> 01:12:12.969]  And folks, you save 85% off supermarket prices, because it's triple concentrated, and you don't pay a middleman, you're getting it factory direct from the family, that for 60 years,
[01:12:15.781 --> 01:12:16.401]  60 years.
[01:12:16.401 --> 01:12:17.742]  His father started it.
[01:12:17.742 --> 01:12:18.402]  He runs it.
[01:12:18.402 --> 01:12:20.644]  His son runs it.
[01:12:20.644 --> 01:12:23.025]  Marty does an excellent job.
[01:12:23.025 --> 01:12:30.330]  And they've got a little sampler pack of basically some of their top products for $16 a month supply.
[01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:33.712]  They've got year supplies, two year supplies, three year supplies.
[01:12:33.712 --> 01:12:39.315]  I had seen their soap one time before when I was in a higher end hotel in D.C.
[01:12:39.315 --> 01:12:41.737]  about many years ago on a trip with my parents.
[01:12:42.501 --> 01:12:44.742]  And I've since seen it a few other places.
[01:12:44.742 --> 01:12:52.487]  Before he started selling it, I don't know, five, six years ago to the general public, you only saw it in high-end hotels and in hospitals, because they're not stupid.
[01:12:52.487 --> 01:12:59.632]  They know what a good deal is, they like to buy factory direct, and they want something that won't cause their customers problems.
[01:13:00.379 --> 01:13:01.560]  So, it's made in America.
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.621]  It supports freedom in this show.
[01:13:03.621 --> 01:13:08.104]  It saves you 85% off the toxic stuff that's made by the chemical companies.
[01:13:08.104 --> 01:13:10.446]  Most of it's petrochemical derived.
[01:13:10.446 --> 01:13:13.688]  It's very bad for your skin, bad for your clothes, and it's expensive.
[01:13:13.688 --> 01:13:16.249]  And you're totally insane if you don't use Calvin Peirce soap.
[01:13:16.249 --> 01:13:18.671]  Now, we still buy some other organic materials.
[01:13:19.291 --> 01:13:24.554]  Frankly, it's because we're busy and we end up not getting on the phone and ordering the product when we run out of it.
[01:13:24.554 --> 01:13:25.675]  We're all like that.
[01:13:25.675 --> 01:13:30.718]  And we go to Whole Foods or we go to the other big organic stores here in Austin.
[01:13:30.718 --> 01:13:32.259]  We're blessed to have those.
[01:13:32.259 --> 01:13:42.125]  Central Market and other organic soaps that aren't as good will be twice as much as inorganic trash at the supermarket.
[01:13:42.125 --> 01:13:46.427]  And then this stuff is 15% the cost of that.
[01:13:46.427 --> 01:13:47.508]  Of just the regular stuff.
[01:13:48.331 --> 01:13:53.975]  So, for those that already use organics, they've been organic since they were founded.
[01:13:53.975 --> 01:13:56.437]  Marty, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:13:56.437 --> 01:13:58.819]  Tell us about the founding of the company.
[01:13:58.819 --> 01:14:02.942]  I want to hear about that today, and then give folks a toll-free number or the website.
[01:14:02.942 --> 01:14:07.506]  Well, Alex, I appreciate you inviting me again to talk to you and your audience.
[01:14:07.506 --> 01:14:14.731]  Basically, the whole concept of what we've done is two words, and that's called choice and value.
[01:14:14.731 --> 01:14:16.893]  And when I got out of the Army,
[01:14:17.463 --> 01:14:20.465]  I was in Japan for a year in 1947.
[01:14:20.465 --> 01:14:26.470]  My father retired from civil service, and we were looking around what we could do together.
[01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:34.356]  And we went to the supermarkets and looking at all the chemicals and detergents, and we noticed soap was not available anymore.
[01:14:34.356 --> 01:14:37.699]  Everything converted over to detergents.
[01:14:37.699 --> 01:14:41.122]  And we thought, hey, wouldn't this be something we started the soap business?
[01:14:41.122 --> 01:14:43.964]  But we had no way of getting to the consumer.
[01:14:43.964 --> 01:14:46.766]  It was all tied up by Procter, Lever, and Colgate.
[01:14:47.307 --> 01:14:49.568]  So we decided to go commercial.
[01:14:49.568 --> 01:14:55.689]  We sold hospitals and schools and convalescent homes, retirement centers.
[01:14:55.689 --> 01:14:59.330]  This is what we can get to a purchasing agent.
[01:14:59.330 --> 01:15:02.911]  We could demo and sample and we can get sales.
[01:15:02.911 --> 01:15:12.073]  And it was only about, I'd say, three years ago that we got a call from Michael Trudeau of Genesis Communication Network.
[01:15:12.073 --> 01:15:14.674]  And he invited us to be on the radio.
[01:15:14.674 --> 01:15:15.534]  And he said, gee, what a
[01:15:16.196 --> 01:15:23.583]  It never occurred to us that we could do that, to talk direct to the consumer, from our factory, to the family.
[01:15:23.583 --> 01:15:32.612]  And that basically gave us the concept of four basic products, bath soap, air soap, dish soap, and laundry soap.
[01:15:32.612 --> 01:15:33.232]  And those are 200 jobs!
[01:15:34.369 --> 01:15:40.752]  You don't need the window cleaners, and the floor cleaners, and the all-purpose cleaners, and the chemicals, and the solvents.
[01:15:40.752 --> 01:15:43.434]  I gotta tell you about the newest thing in chemicals.
[01:15:43.434 --> 01:15:47.396]  I just got my newest copy of Consumer Reports.
[01:15:47.396 --> 01:15:48.897]  And I'm gonna quote you from them.
[01:15:48.897 --> 01:15:52.058]  Oh, I got my copy, too, about how the child seats are so dangerous.
[01:15:52.058 --> 01:15:54.540]  Only two brands actually save kids, but sorry.
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:55.080]  Side issue.
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.061]  Go ahead.
[01:15:56.061 --> 01:16:00.503]  Page 43 of the newest issue talks about laundry detergent.
[01:16:01.141 --> 01:16:05.923]  Now this is a blessing that they're giving the American public for the new year.
[01:16:05.923 --> 01:16:12.106]  And it says the chemicals in laundry detergents like clean clothing are called surfactants.
[01:16:12.106 --> 01:16:17.528]  But in the case of at least one type, surfactant is also a dirty word.
[01:16:17.528 --> 01:16:28.773]  Non-phenyl ethyl oxalates, also known as NPE, are recognized by the EPA as toxic to plants and animals.
[01:16:29.329 --> 01:16:30.431]  I don't think so.
[01:16:42.409 --> 01:16:47.633]  Another bonus for the consumer of a toxic chemical in laundry detergent.
[01:17:00.943 --> 01:17:07.786]  Uh, and you've got oils out of different nuts, out of different citrus, out of vegetables.
[01:17:07.786 --> 01:17:17.089]  This is super high quality and because there's not all the middlemen and the millions of dollars of advertising like Procter & Gamble, you save 85% off supermarket costs.
[01:17:17.549 --> 01:17:20.810]  Folks, you need to give Marty a call right now.
[01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:24.952]  Get a free catalog or get the $16 sampler pack.
[01:17:24.952 --> 01:17:29.614]  It is so important for everybody out there to give Marty a call right now.
[01:17:29.614 --> 01:17:32.035]  1-800-340-7091, 1-800-340-7091, or calbinpuresoap.com, or 5starsoap.com, or link through via InfoWars.
[01:17:44.975 --> 01:17:48.176]  On InfoWars, we have a big banner on the left-hand side.
[01:17:48.176 --> 01:17:51.397]  We have text links on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:17:51.397 --> 01:17:56.739]  But everybody needs to call that toll-free number today to stop procrastinating 800-340-7091.
[01:17:56.739 --> 01:17:58.340]  Or you can go to CalBenPureSoap.com or FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:12.192]  Marty, any other reasons people should get your soap?
[01:18:12.192 --> 01:18:14.553]  Well, one, it's factory direct.
[01:18:14.553 --> 01:18:17.154]  Two, they're pure soaps.
[01:18:17.154 --> 01:18:23.037]  Not detergents, but soaps from the olden 18th, 19th, and 20th century.
[01:18:23.037 --> 01:18:24.177]  They do a better job.
[01:18:24.177 --> 01:18:26.638]  You have longevity of your clothing.
[01:18:26.638 --> 01:18:28.819]  Your skin will feel alive again.
[01:18:28.819 --> 01:18:31.000]  Your hair will be refreshed again.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.161]  Your dishes and washing them by hand.
[01:18:33.161 --> 01:18:34.462]  You don't have to wear gloves.
[01:18:34.958 --> 01:18:51.761]  Of course it doesn't hurt, harm, it's all natural, it's pollution free, and we've been doing this, and this is our year, the 60th year of getting soap back into the home again, and saying to Proctor, Lever, and Colgate, I don't need you anymore!
[01:18:51.761 --> 01:18:57.422]  That's right, you guys started in 1947, so you're now celebrating your 60th year.
[01:18:57.422 --> 01:19:00.943]  And our slogan here is, our business is going down the drain.
[01:19:02.441 --> 01:19:03.322]  All right, Marty.
[01:19:03.322 --> 01:19:08.965]  CalvinPierceSoap.com or FiveStarSoap.com or 1-800-340-7091.
[01:19:08.965 --> 01:19:10.886]  Thanks for coming on, Marty, and we'll talk to you again.
[01:19:10.886 --> 01:19:13.627]  I'd like to leave a thought for today.
[01:19:13.627 --> 01:19:22.532]  The thought for today is sex on television is not harmful unless you fall off.
[01:19:22.532 --> 01:19:23.533]  Take care, my friend.
[01:19:23.533 --> 01:19:24.653]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:19:24.653 --> 01:19:25.093]  All right.
[01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:25.994]  Good to talk to Marty.
[01:19:25.994 --> 01:19:26.614]  What a character.
[01:19:26.614 --> 01:19:30.716]  And we like to bring good products, and he comes on with us once a month, so there's his visit.
[01:19:30.716 --> 01:19:31.697]  And we believe in it.
[01:19:32.654 --> 01:19:34.336]  It'll save you money, it'll save your skin.
[01:19:34.336 --> 01:19:41.342]  I tell you, folks, if I use just regular soap on my face, you know, you're all dry, all crackly.
[01:19:41.342 --> 01:19:42.963]  It doesn't with this.
[01:19:42.963 --> 01:19:44.765]  So give Marty a call, folks.
[01:19:44.765 --> 01:19:47.827]  All right, when we get back, I'm going to get into the big Madrid bombing.
[01:19:47.827 --> 01:19:51.450]  And no, I'm not talking about the one on 311.
[01:19:51.450 --> 01:19:58.556]  I'm talking about the Madrid bombing last weekend that no one seems to know about.
[01:19:58.556 --> 01:20:00.298]  I mean, I am ashamed of the fact
[01:20:01.633 --> 01:20:04.516]  That I didn't know about this, and everybody I knew didn't know about this.
[01:20:04.516 --> 01:20:12.984]  And it's just an illustration, just like really no one's going to hear about the Mexican troops attacking on a routine basis.
[01:20:12.984 --> 01:20:20.292]  The media is there to scare you about things that don't exist, or very small threats, and to cover up real threats.
[01:20:22.262 --> 01:20:26.925]  And they'll always tell you that they're going to be your savior, but they've got all the answers.
[01:20:26.925 --> 01:20:27.605]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:27.605 --> 01:20:28.766]  Webster Tarpon is coming up, too.
[01:20:28.766 --> 01:20:30.407]  We'll also take calls later.
[01:20:30.407 --> 01:20:31.828]  And we'll go into Billy Bird group in the third hour.
[01:20:32.665 --> 01:20:38.166]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:40.487]  Your source for free solar electricity.

[01:20:47.729 --> 01:20:59.652]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[01:20:59.652 --> 01:21:01.152]  It's multi-voltage capability
[01:21:01.152 --> 01:21:07.294]  These multiple adapters and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.

[01:21:33.723 --> 01:21:36.865]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:36.865 --> 01:21:42.807]  Did you know that the United Nations has never settled disputes, but always makes them worse?
[01:21:42.807 --> 01:21:47.349]  Our own ambassador to the United Nations in 1982 admitted such.
[01:21:47.349 --> 01:21:55.712]  Did you know that the United Nations ignores communist atrocities, but always targets non-communist nations and their leaders for overthrow?
[01:21:56.753 --> 01:22:08.124]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:22:35.035 --> 01:22:37.356]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:22:39.855 --> 01:22:44.879]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:22:44.879 --> 01:22:47.661]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:22:47.661 --> 01:22:50.123]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:22:50.123 --> 01:22:55.647]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:22:55.647 --> 01:23:03.913]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:23:03.913 --> 01:23:06.975]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[01:23:09.108 --> 01:23:13.529]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:37.621]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[01:23:37.621 --> 01:23:41.863]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[01:23:41.863 --> 01:23:48.404]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.

[01:24:28.447 --> 01:24:29.789]  Welcome back.
[01:24:29.789 --> 01:24:39.319]  This is a story up on presentplanet.com yesterday.
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:53.824]  Terror is trivial when it's not Muslims.
[01:24:53.824 --> 01:24:57.629]  Madrid airport bombing received scant attention by Paul Watson.
[01:24:57.629 --> 01:25:02.275]  How many people who aren't news junkies know that Madrid airport was bombed on Saturday?
[01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:05.952]  Folks, I didn't know until I saw this story yesterday afternoon.
[01:25:05.952 --> 01:25:16.517]  Relatively few, I would venture, and that's because major western governments and their media mouthpieces don't hype terror unless they can claim Muslims are behind it.
[01:25:16.517 --> 01:25:23.480]  I personally only caught the story a couple days after it happened on the obscure channel on UK digital satellite called Euronews.
[01:25:25.143 --> 01:25:37.848]  Operatives of the Basque Separatist Organization, ETA, packed 800 kilograms of explosives into a car bomb that ripped apart the parking lot of the Madrid airport, killing two and injuring twelve people.
[01:25:37.848 --> 01:25:38.808]  Twenty people!
[01:25:38.808 --> 01:25:43.030]  I mean, it blew out a whole bunch of... I'm looking at, like, three floors completely blown away.
[01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:47.752]  Now imagine if Al-Qaeda or Al-Syeda bombed Heathrow or LAX.
[01:25:47.752 --> 01:25:49.192]  You'd never hear the end of it.
[01:25:49.192 --> 01:25:53.574]  Oh, they'd have a yearly remembrance, and it'd be just... cover of everything.
[01:25:54.321 --> 01:25:57.743]  There'd be flags at half-mast, children crying.
[01:25:57.743 --> 01:26:00.344]  Now imagine if LCIA had bombed Heathrow or LAX.
[01:26:00.344 --> 01:26:01.705]  You'd never hear the end of it.
[01:26:01.705 --> 01:26:06.848]  The news would be on it 24-7, and entering an airport would be akin to checking into a concentration camp.
[01:26:06.848 --> 01:26:12.751]  And yet Saturday's blast was greeted by little more than bylines and muted dismissals by the mainstream media.
[01:26:12.751 --> 01:26:15.793]  And that's because it's probably real.
[01:26:15.793 --> 01:26:18.295]  The Basque are blowing stuff up constantly.
[01:26:18.295 --> 01:26:18.915]  It's their war.
[01:26:20.464 --> 01:26:25.227]  You can argue it's how they militarily fight back, because their region is always being dominated.
[01:26:25.227 --> 01:26:26.007]  I'm not defending it.
[01:26:26.007 --> 01:26:33.091]  My point is that when you have real terrorism, governments keep it very quiet, because you don't want to give terrorists attention.
[01:26:33.091 --> 01:26:35.553]  That empowers them to do more of it.
[01:26:35.553 --> 01:26:43.177]  Only if you are the terrorist, or you're using what they did for control against another target, do you hype it.
[01:26:43.177 --> 01:26:45.739]  That was in the anti-terror handbooks ten, twenty years ago.
[01:26:45.739 --> 01:26:46.359]  I've read them.
[01:26:47.916 --> 01:26:49.076]  How do you deal with terrorism?
[01:26:49.076 --> 01:26:49.737]  You ignore it.
[01:26:49.737 --> 01:26:50.737]  You don't give it attention.
[01:26:50.737 --> 01:26:52.758]  You don't let their fear spread.
[01:26:52.758 --> 01:26:58.180]  But if your government are the terrorist, or hire terrorists, you get the opposite.
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:07.663]  Before 9-11, terrorism was seen through the prism of criminal problems because fewer people lose their lives as a result of that than those who get struck by lightning.
[01:27:07.663 --> 01:27:11.905]  We have another article out today about how peanuts kill more every year in the U.S.
[01:27:11.905 --> 01:27:12.525]  than terrorism.
[01:27:13.354 --> 01:27:16.257]  But see, now they're changing the definition of terrorism to all crime.
[01:27:16.257 --> 01:27:21.743]  There have been just 2,929 terror-induced deaths since 9-11.
[01:27:21.743 --> 01:27:30.312]  According to the Bush administration's own numbers, and more people every year die in swimming pool accidents, hardly the mega-threat to Western society that many have portrayed.
[01:27:30.911 --> 01:27:45.210]  Put it in context, Saturday's bombing would not have made the top of the news because like all terrorism that occurs in the West, it is extremely rare, random, like murder, rape, or theft, is impossible to ever truly prevent.
[01:27:46.172 --> 01:28:01.064]  But in the post-911 world, the artificial creation and maintenance of the myth of Islamofascism is dependent on ceaseless obsession with the imminent threat of Muslim terror, while leaving the border open and bringing in record numbers of them.
[01:28:01.064 --> 01:28:05.368]  I would add that, you know, it's such a big threat, why are you bringing in record numbers?
[01:28:05.368 --> 01:28:06.289]  And it goes on.
[01:28:06.289 --> 01:28:15.036]  And that's why something like the Madrid airport bombing would have been shoved down the throats until Kingdom Come, but only if Muslims weren't behind it.
[01:28:15.638 --> 01:28:26.271]  Terror attacks like Saturdays become mere precursors to the, and finally, puff piece if they can't be pinned on Islamofascist and the scam recycle.
[01:28:26.271 --> 01:28:33.460]  It's almost a national emergency nowadays if Muslims, God forbid, are seen praying on an airplane.
[01:28:34.076 --> 01:28:49.460]  And their every action is being scrutinized as a foreboding for the apocalypse, which only breeds suspicion across all of society and has turned the land of the free, the United States, into the land of hysteria.
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:53.941]  Swimming pools kill more Americans than terrorists today, Muslim or otherwise.
[01:28:53.941 --> 01:28:56.682]  Fear is a lie.
[01:28:56.682 --> 01:29:00.283]  Good story by Paul Watson up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:29:02.066 --> 01:29:09.510]  And it's the same thing with the open borders and the crime spree and the rocket attacks and the car bombs in Texas.
[01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:15.093]  It's kept quiet and you tell the average cop, I've talked to cops, hey have you heard about all the problems on the border?
[01:29:15.093 --> 01:29:16.353]  Have you heard about the rocket attacks?
[01:29:16.353 --> 01:29:17.454]  Huh?
[01:29:17.454 --> 01:29:18.214]  Rocket attack?
[01:29:18.214 --> 01:29:21.476]  I've even asked police out on the street, what are you talking about?
[01:29:21.476 --> 01:29:23.557]  And the citizens certainly don't know anything about it.
[01:29:24.289 --> 01:29:26.851]  But oh my gosh, Al-Qaeda is everywhere!
[01:29:26.851 --> 01:29:27.791]  They're gonna get us!
[01:29:27.791 --> 01:29:30.053]  We better let Bush read our mail!
[01:29:30.053 --> 01:29:31.914]  We better let him track all our cell phones!
[01:29:31.914 --> 01:29:37.697]  We better have FBI and CIA over all these fusion centers, these emergency management centers!
[01:29:37.697 --> 01:29:42.820]  Every bureaucrat and every citizen better act like Jack Bauer and look under every table!
[01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:52.086]  And there's long fanged Al-Qaeda members under every table, in every closet, under every bed, ready to bite you as soon as you turn away!
[01:29:55.279 --> 01:29:58.080]  Just amazing.
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:00.580]  And then they found 220 pounds of explosives in Spain.
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:05.781]  A bunch of other reports.
[01:30:05.781 --> 01:30:08.121]  Amazing.
[01:30:08.121 --> 01:30:10.362]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:30:10.362 --> 01:30:17.803]  Alright, we'll come back with Webster Griffin Tarntley to get his update and his view on 2007 coming up.
[01:30:17.803 --> 01:30:20.804]  And to talk about Gerald Ford and George Herbert Walker.
[01:30:23.118 --> 01:30:24.499]  We're on the march.
[01:30:24.499 --> 01:30:27.020]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:33.282]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:33.282 --> 01:30:37.464]  I found this company online and they have this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[01:30:37.464 --> 01:30:41.285]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[01:30:41.285 --> 01:30:45.667]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[01:30:45.667 --> 01:30:46.827]  I was so amazed.
[01:30:46.827 --> 01:30:49.868]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight.
[01:30:49.868 --> 01:30:51.729]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[01:30:52.109 --> 01:30:57.772]  SoleilWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[01:30:57.772 --> 01:31:03.975]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[01:31:03.975 --> 01:31:05.956]  I figured it would clean really well.
[01:31:05.956 --> 01:31:09.317]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[01:31:09.317 --> 01:31:13.479]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[01:31:13.479 --> 01:31:14.940]  Plus, the service was great.
[01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:20.483]  If you're interested in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies, visit SoleilWellness.com.
[01:31:20.483 --> 01:31:23.784]  That's S-O-L-A-Y Wellness dot com.

[01:31:24.285 --> 01:31:24.325]  312-224-2710.
[01:31:32.961 --> 01:31:34.883]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[01:31:34.883 --> 01:31:43.832]  According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars, from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive.
[01:31:43.832 --> 01:31:49.558]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served, or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[01:31:49.958 --> 01:31:57.723]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who spend their lives protecting our freedom, and to those who have lost their lives doing so.
[01:31:57.723 --> 01:32:03.386]  Davis Products is offering high quality solid cast aluminum memorial markers for your American flag.
[01:32:03.386 --> 01:32:07.609]  Each memorial marker is specifically designed to represent one of 15 wars.

[01:32:14.113 --> 01:32:17.134]  What better way to pay homage to our enlisted loved ones?
[01:32:17.134 --> 01:32:21.495]  Davis Products Memorial Markers are only $9 a piece and can be ordered by calling 814-827-4946.

[01:32:32.788 --> 01:32:37.054]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:32:37.054 --> 01:32:40.639]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:32:40.639 --> 01:32:44.044]  Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:32:44.361 --> 01:32:47.642]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:32:47.642 --> 01:32:53.124]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[01:32:53.124 --> 01:33:02.887]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:33:02.887 --> 01:33:04.227]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[01:33:04.227 --> 01:33:09.689]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:33:10.169 --> 01:33:14.691]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:33:14.691 --> 01:33:16.212]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:33:16.212 --> 01:33:20.154]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[01:33:45.943 --> 01:34:10.251]  I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle tears a hole
[01:34:12.589 --> 01:34:34.670]  The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become?
[01:34:34.670 --> 01:34:36.651]  My sweetest friend
[01:34:39.415 --> 01:34:58.089]  Everyone I know goes away in the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down Welcome back!
[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:09.641]  Glad you joined us.
[01:35:09.641 --> 01:35:11.021]  We're about to go to Webster Tarpley.
[01:35:11.021 --> 01:35:13.523]  First interview with him of the new year.
[01:35:13.523 --> 01:35:20.227]  Before we do that, if you believe in this broadcast and what we're doing, you need to support us.
[01:35:20.227 --> 01:35:32.635]  And you do that, number one, by getting my documentary films and the other books and videos I carry by other authors, like Webster Griffin's Tarpley's newest edition of 9-11 Synthetic Terror, made in the USA, that we carry.
[01:35:32.635 --> 01:35:37.738]  Then you support us, you get a great book, get informed, or have a great gift to give somebody, and you support Webster.
[01:35:38.467 --> 01:35:50.531]  We got a bunch of books, a bunch of videos, 9-11 Mysteries Demolitions, Loose Change 2nd Edition, my new film Terror Storm with 68 minutes of extras, like Webster Tarpley speaking in LA.
[01:35:50.531 --> 01:35:52.551]  We've got America Freedom to Fascism.
[01:35:52.551 --> 01:35:58.953]  You can get Terror Storm as low as $9.95 when you get it with other videos.
[01:35:58.953 --> 01:36:01.054]  We combo them up together.
[01:36:01.054 --> 01:36:03.515]  You can get some of my films as low as $5.95 apiece.
[01:36:03.515 --> 01:36:04.435]  T-shirts as low as $9.95 apiece.
[01:36:09.145 --> 01:36:19.817]  I mean, we are putting our material out at the lowest possible price because our goal is, frankly, when we discounted everything about six months ago, it didn't increase sales.
[01:36:19.817 --> 01:36:20.278]  I don't care.
[01:36:21.169 --> 01:36:26.071]  We did it so you can get more of these materials to get them out to people.
[01:36:26.071 --> 01:36:26.991]  That's the goal.
[01:36:26.991 --> 01:36:28.492]  Take my new Police State Trilogy.
[01:36:28.492 --> 01:36:29.512]  My first seven films.
[01:36:29.512 --> 01:36:31.192]  Never had time to get them on DVD.
[01:36:31.192 --> 01:36:32.953]  They're now all on DVD.
[01:36:32.953 --> 01:36:35.254]  America Destroyed by Design.
[01:36:35.254 --> 01:36:41.996]  We've got The Masters of Terror, Matrix of Evil, Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:36:41.996 --> 01:36:46.838]  Those three are together in the Police State Trilogy in one DVD package.
[01:36:46.838 --> 01:36:47.738]  Three separate DVDs.
[01:36:47.738 --> 01:36:47.758]  $34.95.
[01:36:47.758 --> 01:36:48.078]  That's 45% off.

[01:37:11.257 --> 01:37:15.179]  I mean, I hate to describe us as a pathogen, but we are against the New World Order.
[01:37:18.057 --> 01:37:23.860]  Literally, I guess I'm the first virus to come into the body, but if you don't help us replicate, it has no effect.
[01:37:23.860 --> 01:37:24.741]  Well, let's turn that around.
[01:37:24.741 --> 01:37:32.066]  Let's say the New World Order is a disease, and we are white blood cell programmers, or T-lymphocytes.
[01:37:32.066 --> 01:37:36.569]  There might be one for 100,000 regular white blood cells, and then I'm kind of like a T-lymphocyte.
[01:37:37.256 --> 01:37:43.500]  I go out and I tell people what to attack, or I try to get you to focus in on an enemy pathogen.
[01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:46.022]  So we need you to act like white blood cells out there.

[01:38:47.943 --> 01:38:53.184]  In closing on this plug here, we've added three special reports that a lot of work went into.
[01:38:53.184 --> 01:38:53.804]  Three free.
[01:39:05.143 --> 01:39:09.265]  Excuse me, three for PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[01:39:09.265 --> 01:39:13.647]  We've got the... Well, there's three new reports up there this week.
[01:39:13.647 --> 01:39:18.589]  There's another one going up Monday.
[01:39:18.589 --> 01:39:20.649]  These are reports that people put a lot of time into.
[01:39:20.649 --> 01:39:22.870]  These are documentaries.
[01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:32.254]  And then we put a free one out that took two people two days to make of the FEMA camp in Taylor with all the supplied documents and video clips.
[01:39:32.254 --> 01:39:34.135]  We just put that out for free on Google Video.
[01:39:35.134 --> 01:39:39.336]  So we also try to put out a lot of stuff free, so you subsidize the truth.
[01:39:39.336 --> 01:39:40.917]  You fund us in this fight.
[01:39:40.917 --> 01:39:47.861]  When you become PrisonPlanet.tv members, that's how we pay my people so they can, you know, have gas for their cars and food to eat.
[01:39:47.861 --> 01:39:49.882]  And maybe get a bonus at Christmas.
[01:39:49.882 --> 01:39:51.063]  So please support us.
[01:39:51.063 --> 01:39:56.085]  Alright, let's go to Webster Griffin Tarpley for the next 25 minutes or so.
[01:39:56.085 --> 01:39:58.627]  And he joins us from his home in Washington, D.C.
[01:40:00.025 --> 01:40:04.617]  Webster, I want to get your take on what we see coming up in 2007, the neocons, Iran, the Saddam execution.
[01:40:07.515 --> 01:40:15.839]  But before we do that, I know you're a real expert on the Bush junta and how they really came to power by stabbing Nixon in the back.
[01:40:15.839 --> 01:40:18.240]  You've written books and articles on the subject.
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:21.802]  So, happy New Year to you and good to have you on with us.
[01:40:21.802 --> 01:40:22.382]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:40:22.382 --> 01:40:25.624]  Happy New Year to you and happy New Year to your listeners.
[01:40:25.624 --> 01:40:31.407]  Webster, tell us, you've written some articles about this and you've also got great analysis on it.
[01:40:31.407 --> 01:40:33.287]  Tell us about what happened back in 1974 with Gerald Ford
[01:40:35.930 --> 01:40:38.832]  75, and then take us up to speed on what you see happening in the New Year.
[01:40:38.832 --> 01:40:51.762]  Well, I think the first thing is we've just had this attempt to rewrite history around Gerald Ford, and naturally our sympathies go to the bereaved family, but we cannot allow this tremendous lying campaign to stand.
[01:40:51.762 --> 01:40:55.665]  Gerald Ford was a loyal servant of the invisible government.
[01:40:55.665 --> 01:41:01.910]  He was essentially a stooge of the banking faction in Wall Street that runs the United States.
[01:41:02.812 --> 01:41:10.216]  And that's basically his career, and in particular, to understand what he did, you've got to understand what Watergate was.
[01:41:10.216 --> 01:41:26.464]  A lot of people, especially leftists, have bought into this myth about two crusading journalists who love democracy, and the lovable curmudgeon editor who lets them put this in the Washington Post, and they bring down this tremendously powerful machine in the White House.
[01:41:26.464 --> 01:41:30.386]  It's sort of David and Goliath, with Woodward and Bernstein being the David.
[01:41:30.888 --> 01:41:32.829]  This is absolutely ridiculous.
[01:41:32.829 --> 01:41:44.737]  Watergate is a coup d'etat carried out by the intelligence community against a throwaway puppet, a villain of course, a criminal certainly, Richard Nixon.
[01:41:44.737 --> 01:41:53.163]  But the main thing to focus on is that this tended to consolidate and increase the power of the secret intelligence agencies over the United States.
[01:41:53.163 --> 01:41:54.544]  Just a couple of notes on this.
[01:41:55.026 --> 01:41:56.110]  It all starts with leaks.
[01:41:56.110 --> 01:41:59.299]  It starts with the leaking of the Pentagon Papers and other leaks.
[01:41:59.299 --> 01:42:00.883]  Fine, who did the Pentagon Papers?
[01:42:01.354 --> 01:42:06.496]  Daniel Ellsberg of the RAND Corporation, with a top-secret security clearance.
[01:42:06.496 --> 01:42:10.578]  He was somebody who chose targets for thermonuclear weapons.
[01:42:10.578 --> 01:42:14.179]  So, somebody from the bowels of the intelligence community.
[01:42:14.179 --> 01:42:19.601]  Then, Henry Kissinger, inside the White House, goes to Nixon and says, these leaks are killing us.
[01:42:19.601 --> 01:42:22.942]  We'd better set up a secret police department here in the White House.
[01:42:22.942 --> 01:42:24.503]  Let's call it the Plumbers.
[01:42:24.503 --> 01:42:29.985]  This is Henry Kissinger, with strong ties to British intelligence, a protege of Nelson Rockefeller,
[01:42:31.169 --> 01:42:34.431]  And therefore, that entire intelligence community faction.
[01:42:34.431 --> 01:42:35.912]  Who do they hire for the plumbers?
[01:42:35.912 --> 01:42:56.703]  Well, two of the most prominent CIA agents of the Cold War, Howard Hunt, above all, who had been in Guatemala, the Kennedy assassination, and so forth, James McCord of the CIA, Gordon Liddy of the FBI, somebody with, I suppose, Nazi sympathies, I guess it's fair to say, and they set up this group of plumbers
[01:42:57.165 --> 01:42:59.907]  Who are also penetrated by other people.
[01:42:59.907 --> 01:43:02.588]  They have four attempted break-ins.
[01:43:02.588 --> 01:43:08.852]  Remember, they keep going back to the Democratic National Committee until they finally get arrested.
[01:43:08.852 --> 01:43:14.415]  You can read this in a book called Secret Agenda by Jim Haugen.
[01:43:14.415 --> 01:43:17.717]  And then, after the fourth break-in, they're finally caught.
[01:43:17.717 --> 01:43:21.879]  They're put in the dock in a criminal court and Bob Woodward
[01:43:22.389 --> 01:43:23.650]  That just happens to be there.
[01:43:23.650 --> 01:43:24.930]  Who's Bob Woodward?
[01:43:24.930 --> 01:43:27.132]  He is from the Office of Naval Intelligence.
[01:43:27.132 --> 01:43:31.894]  He is somebody who was the intelligence officer for one of the floating command posts.
[01:43:31.894 --> 01:43:32.815]  Very interesting, right?
[01:43:32.815 --> 01:43:37.217]  In case of thermonuclear war, the president can go to a land bunker.
[01:43:37.217 --> 01:43:39.518]  So it's all these key shadow government individuals.
[01:43:39.518 --> 01:43:40.499]  I should also add that
[01:43:41.219 --> 01:43:41.479]  Ms.
[01:43:41.479 --> 01:43:45.682]  Graham was one of the head Bilderberg group members, attended every meeting.
[01:43:45.682 --> 01:43:49.765]  Her husband before that, Donald Graham, had been one of the co-chairmen.
[01:43:49.765 --> 01:44:04.214]  So, this is the incredible thoroughbred of old line establishment propaganda media running the whole operation against Nixon, who at the end was starting to balk
[01:44:04.774 --> 01:44:09.856]  And some of the things that the globalists wanted to do, so it was perfect for them.
[01:44:09.856 --> 01:44:13.478]  So really, I guess a coup d'etat against the presidency.
[01:44:13.478 --> 01:44:22.762]  The presidency had been corrupt previously, but now this is the intelligence agencies with the private networks fully discrediting the office of the presidency and taking it over.
[01:44:22.762 --> 01:44:28.845]  The Washington Post, I think you have to see what the Washington Post is, in addition to what Watergate is.
[01:44:28.845 --> 01:44:31.946]  Eugene Meyer is the founder of the modern-day Washington Post.
[01:44:31.946 --> 01:44:33.207]  He was in the Federal Reserve.
[01:44:33.672 --> 01:44:42.618]  When Franklin D. Roosevelt rightly dumped the British-dominated gold standard in 1933, Eugene Meyer says, this is the end of the world.
[01:44:42.618 --> 01:44:47.461]  We've got to reassert the domination of financiers against the Roosevelt New Deal.
[01:44:47.461 --> 01:44:48.842]  I'm going to Washington.
[01:44:48.842 --> 01:44:53.845]  I'm going to create a newspaper that will fight Roosevelt and everything that he stands for.
[01:44:53.845 --> 01:44:55.846]  Therefore, you look at the Washington Post.
[01:44:55.846 --> 01:44:59.769]  It is the house organ of the Federal Reserve System and of the financiers.
[01:45:00.194 --> 01:45:09.800]  And their vested interest is a weak, passive presidency, so that the financiers and the Federal Reserve can run wild and run the country, and that's basically what it is.
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:19.905]  So then their reporter, Bob Woodward of the Office of Naval Intelligence, with his cosmic intelligence clearance, gets leaks from Mark Felt of the FBI.
[01:45:19.905 --> 01:45:29.331]  They get the hearings going, then John Dean comes forward with his revelations, and this guy Alexander Butterfield, who says, oh, by the way, there's a taping system in the White House.
[01:45:29.944 --> 01:45:33.085]  And then it goes down to the smoking gun tape.
[01:45:33.085 --> 01:45:36.907]  Now, most people have forgotten what's in the smoking gun tape.
[01:45:36.907 --> 01:45:41.749]  In the smoking gun tape, Nixon is talking about a plan for obstruction of justice and perjury.
[01:45:42.489 --> 01:45:45.850]  And he says, those Texans have got to say this, that, and the other thing.
[01:45:45.850 --> 01:45:47.230]  The Texans, the Texans.
[01:45:47.230 --> 01:45:48.851]  Who are the Texans he's talking about?
[01:45:48.851 --> 01:45:50.531]  Well, George H.W.
[01:45:50.531 --> 01:45:54.512]  Bush and his partner, Liedtke, from Pennzoil.
[01:45:54.512 --> 01:46:01.654]  Those are the Texans who were laundering money from Texas to Mexico and then into the coffers of the committee to re-elect the president.
[01:46:01.654 --> 01:46:04.375]  And of course, Bush had been CIA director, ambassador to China.
[01:46:04.375 --> 01:46:05.255]  He'd also been a congressman.
[01:46:05.255 --> 01:46:06.156]  Well, he became that later.
[01:46:06.156 --> 01:46:08.116]  This is now after this.
[01:46:08.116 --> 01:46:11.097]  In other words, the CIA director comes later, ambassador to China.
[01:46:11.417 --> 01:46:12.979]  These are things in 75-76.
[01:46:12.979 --> 01:46:21.870]  The contributions in question are from 71-72 for the re-election campaign of Nixon.
[01:46:21.870 --> 01:46:27.377]  So therefore, when Gerald Ford is told by Nelson Rockefeller that he has just appointed
[01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:28.010]  I think?
[01:46:46.750 --> 01:46:55.054]  His legal defense may be to fight back against a conspiracy for a coup d'etat with all of these agencies.
[01:46:55.054 --> 01:47:04.459]  Which is what Nixon was starting to tell his confidants, and now we hear he was paranoid, he was insane, he was delusional, but really it was just the truth.
[01:47:05.137 --> 01:47:12.922]  Well, I don't have very much tenderness or optimism about Nixon as a figure, but the fact is, this is what happened.
[01:47:12.922 --> 01:47:14.343]  It is a coup d'etat.
[01:47:14.343 --> 01:47:15.724]  Nixon was entrapped.
[01:47:15.724 --> 01:47:21.628]  Obviously, his proclivity to engage in illegal behavior came into play.
[01:47:21.628 --> 01:47:23.069]  That's also clear.
[01:47:23.069 --> 01:47:24.650]  But the essence of the matter is,
[01:47:25.466 --> 01:47:31.789]  The goal of this entire operation was to permanently weaken the office of the presidency, to weaken the government as a whole.
[01:47:31.789 --> 01:47:35.710]  Well, that's what Clinton was also meant to do on an ongoing basis, but let's go back.
[01:47:35.710 --> 01:47:41.712]  We also have Gerald Ford being selected because he was on the Warren Commission, and what do you think of the nerve at the D.C.
[01:47:41.712 --> 01:47:43.073]  funeral, one of three or four,
[01:47:43.613 --> 01:47:50.155]  We have to remember, Lyndon B. Johnson once said, Gerald Ford is so stupid that he can't walk and chew gum at the same time.
[01:47:50.155 --> 01:47:53.416]  That's what comes of playing all those football games with no helmet.
[01:48:13.416 --> 01:48:26.206]  I would also cite the right-wing reactionary editor of the Manchester Union-Leader in New Hampshire, William Loeb, and his name for the deceased former president, Jerry the Jerk.
[01:48:26.206 --> 01:48:28.528]  He'd say, Jerry the Jerk just came to town.
[01:48:28.528 --> 01:48:30.369]  So imagine Johnson.
[01:48:30.369 --> 01:48:37.695]  He knows that Ford is this imbecile, basically, and he puts him on the Warren Commission.
[01:48:37.695 --> 01:48:41.478]  This doesn't indicate that he really expects the Warren Commission to do very much.
[01:48:42.190 --> 01:48:52.265]  Ford is on there as filler, as a hand-raiser, as somebody who can simply be counted on to approve whatever Allen Dulles and John J. McCloy... Why do you think Bush Sr.
[01:48:52.265 --> 01:48:55.030]  would shoot his mouth off like that on national television?
[01:48:56.286 --> 01:48:57.867]  Well, of course, Bush Sr.
[01:48:57.867 --> 01:49:05.128]  is up to his neck in it, in the sense that he is... No, clearly involved in the JFK assassination, clearly involved in Bay of Pigs, that's the point I'm making.
[01:49:05.128 --> 01:49:05.428]  Yeah.
[01:49:05.428 --> 01:49:10.269]  I mean, is it just doddering, or is there some arrogant Machiavellian reason he did this?
[01:49:10.269 --> 01:49:18.011]  Well, you know, one of the great phrases of Watergate is, all the trees in the forest will fall, and I'm convinced that if 9-11 truth comes out,
[01:49:18.772 --> 01:49:22.575]  Uh, we break through the question of the 9-11 conspiracy.
[01:49:22.575 --> 01:49:29.680]  You will then see that being taken back in time to include things like the Kennedy assassination, the Gulf of Tonkin,
[01:49:30.174 --> 01:49:33.315]  The Vietnam War and a whole series of other tremendous crimes.
[01:49:33.315 --> 01:49:40.656]  Iran-Contra really ought to be reopened in the light of Negroponte and Gates and people like this being so prominent.
[01:49:40.656 --> 01:49:42.496]  All the trees in the forest must fall.
[01:49:42.496 --> 01:49:52.398]  And once you begin to pull on this cord of the invisible government, the rogue network, the secret team, you begin to then get a new view of all of these things.
[01:49:52.398 --> 01:49:55.459]  And maybe that's what Bush the Elder is concerned about.
[01:49:55.459 --> 01:49:57.019]  A couple of other things about
[01:49:57.555 --> 01:49:58.156]  About Ford.
[01:49:58.156 --> 01:50:04.020]  The pardon is obviously to protect the machine that had taken power.
[01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:10.345]  It's also interesting that all of these invisible government heavies that we see around today get their start under Ford.
[01:50:10.345 --> 01:50:18.352]  People like Cheney, Rumsfeld, Greenspan, Bremer, the guy who destroyed Iraq, Bush, Bush the elder of course,
[01:50:19.362 --> 01:50:21.704]  Bush the Elder tries to become Vice President.
[01:50:21.704 --> 01:50:23.165]  It's a forgotten episode.
[01:50:23.165 --> 01:50:29.029]  In August of 1974, the Vice Presidency was vacant when Ford moved up.
[01:50:29.029 --> 01:50:36.494]  And there was a contest at that point between Nelson Rockefeller and George Bush the Elder to see which of them would become Vice President.
[01:50:36.494 --> 01:50:40.437]  So whichever way Ford went, he was obviously in trouble.
[01:50:40.437 --> 01:50:48.302]  It went to Rockefeller, and that then cleared the way for Sarah Jane Moore and Lynette Squeaky Fromme
[01:50:48.911 --> 01:50:55.842]  To either produce a pistol in the precinct of the President or to take a pot shot at him in the other case.
[01:50:55.842 --> 01:51:03.495]  And of course the beneficiary of those assassination attempts would have been Nelson Rockefeller, obviously you know, Chase Manhattan,
[01:51:03.959 --> 01:51:10.583]  Standard Oil, CIA Faction, Committee for Latin American Intelligence during World War II, and so forth.
[01:51:10.583 --> 01:51:13.904]  So if you want to be president, don't have one of these financier types.
[01:51:13.904 --> 01:51:21.328]  And then we can walk this right through as the better enemies, Reagan and Bush Sr., and then as soon as they get in, they shoot Reagan.
[01:51:21.328 --> 01:51:25.411]  I want to talk a little bit about that, then I want to look forward and get a few of your predictions for 2007.
[01:51:25.411 --> 01:51:28.832]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com is the website.
[01:51:28.832 --> 01:51:31.754]  We're talking to Webster Griffin Tarbley, author and radio talk show host.
[01:51:35.524 --> 01:51:41.353]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:51:41.353 --> 01:51:48.985]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:51:49.679 --> 01:51:57.123]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:51:57.123 --> 01:52:08.869]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:52:08.869 --> 01:52:12.832]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:52:12.832 --> 01:52:15.093]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:52:15.093 --> 01:52:18.935]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:54:36.616 --> 01:54:38.657]  This show is documented.
[01:54:38.657 --> 01:54:41.838]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:41.838 --> 01:54:45.340]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:54:45.340 --> 01:54:48.062]  I went down, down, down.
[01:54:48.062 --> 01:54:50.403]  And the flames went higher.
[01:54:50.403 --> 01:54:53.305]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[01:54:53.305 --> 01:54:54.405]  The ring of fire.
[01:54:54.405 --> 01:54:55.726]  Alright, welcome back.
[01:54:55.726 --> 01:54:56.266]  We're at WebShore.
[01:54:56.266 --> 01:54:57.867]  This is about five minutes to the next hour.
[01:54:57.867 --> 01:55:00.889]  Then we've got Tony Gosling of Bilderberg.
[01:55:02.032 --> 01:55:03.173]  We're good to go.
[01:55:17.363 --> 01:55:20.587]  The interesting thing here is that Ronald Reagan hated George Bush the elder.
[01:55:20.587 --> 01:55:22.189]  Didn't want him on the ticket.
[01:55:35.131 --> 01:55:39.953]  And Reagan, obviously, was somebody who did not understand things conceptually.
[01:55:39.953 --> 01:55:43.294]  He didn't understand some of the things that you've just been mentioning.
[01:55:43.294 --> 01:55:51.697]  What he had seen, though, was the Nashua Telegraph debate, which was set up by George Bush through various intrigues as Bush-Reagan.
[01:55:51.697 --> 01:55:52.998]  But there were other candidates.
[01:55:52.998 --> 01:55:57.880]  There was Bob Dole, there was Howard Baker, there was Phil Crane, there was John Anderson.
[01:55:57.880 --> 01:56:03.182]  There were four or five other Republicans, all, you know, well-known figures, who wanted to be part of the debate.
[01:56:03.732 --> 01:56:06.733]  And Reagan said, sure, fine, get some chairs for all of them.
[01:56:06.733 --> 01:56:08.253]  George Bush says, no!
[01:56:08.253 --> 01:56:09.294]  No!
[01:56:09.294 --> 01:56:10.534]  It's my debate, right?
[01:56:10.534 --> 01:56:13.215]  It's my party and so forth, right?
[01:56:13.215 --> 01:56:14.535]  So he'll have a fit.
[01:56:14.535 --> 01:56:17.336]  So Bush had a fit in public at the debate.
[01:56:17.336 --> 01:56:25.479]  This is the famous, I'm paying for this microphone, Mr. Breen, when they tried to prevent Reagan from inviting these people to take their places.
[01:56:25.479 --> 01:56:29.900]  And this is one of the ways Bush lost the 1980 primary.
[01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:32.301]  So after seeing that, Reagan said, I don't want him.
[01:56:32.662 --> 01:56:45.770]  So what they did was this, an intrigue with Kissinger representing Ford, actually being his controller, negotiating with the Reagan people, would Ford come on the ticket as a co-president or vice president?
[01:56:45.770 --> 01:56:52.495]  And Ford began saying, yes, I'll do it, but I want Henry Kissinger at the State Department, and I want Alan Greenspan at the Treasury.
[01:56:52.495 --> 01:56:54.576]  Imagine this.
[01:56:54.576 --> 01:57:02.301]  So they essentially played out the string, they ate up the clock until it was, well, the night that Reagan had to make the announcement.
[01:57:02.702 --> 01:57:09.787]  And Reagan had focused everything on getting Ford on the ticket to increase his chances, right, to get the prestige of a former president.
[01:57:09.787 --> 01:57:15.652]  And at a certain point that night, Jerry Ford then sent Kissinger over to say, no, it can't be done.
[01:57:15.652 --> 01:57:16.793]  We don't want to do it.
[01:57:16.793 --> 01:57:20.375]  At that point, Reagan had two or three hours to find somebody.
[01:57:20.375 --> 01:57:26.060]  The only thing he could do was to call Bush the elder and invite him to be the vice presidential candidate.
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:37.443]  Again, just like Ford-Rockefeller leading to Sarah Jane Moore and Lynette's squeaky prom, Reagan-Bush leads to John Hinckley Jr.
[01:57:37.443 --> 01:57:43.345]  But in this case, it's even closer in the sense that John Hinckley Jr.
[01:57:43.345 --> 01:57:54.069]  has an elder brother, Scott Hinckley, who is constantly meeting with Neil Bush, the son of the former president, the brother of the current tenant of the White House.
[01:57:55.678 --> 01:58:00.701]  And, of course, that is a tremendous appearance of a conflict of interest.
[01:58:00.701 --> 01:58:01.822]  And it's all confirmed.
[01:58:01.822 --> 01:58:03.764]  It's in the Houston Post.
[01:58:03.764 --> 01:58:11.709]  The Rocky Mountain News and AP Wire documents the fact that these admissions were made.
[01:58:11.709 --> 01:58:17.633]  So, Ford, essentially, is a guy who certainly allows himself to be part of this scheme.
[01:58:17.633 --> 01:58:21.415]  When Ford is leaving the airport from the Republican National Convention in 1980,
[01:58:23.023 --> 01:58:26.666]  Reporter asked him, Hey, President Ford, what did you think of that convention?
[01:58:26.666 --> 01:58:28.167]  And Ford says, I think it's great.
[01:58:28.167 --> 01:58:31.369]  I came here to get George Bush on the ticket and I succeeded.
[01:58:31.369 --> 01:58:33.690]  So the whole thing was a farce.
[01:58:33.690 --> 01:58:35.431]  One last interesting thing.
[01:58:35.431 --> 01:58:38.914]  The 1976 election was actually won by Ford.
[01:58:38.914 --> 01:58:48.500]  But by this time, the Trilateral Commission had already chosen Carter and had presented him at the meeting of the Trilateral Commission in Kyoto, Japan.
[01:58:48.985 --> 01:59:01.835]  Carter was going to bring on Brzezinski for Foreign Affairs, Volker for the Federal Reserve, so they thought it was time to further weaken the presidency by getting Ford out, Carter in, and therefore Carter got through with vote fraud.
[01:59:01.835 --> 01:59:06.239]  And when you come back, I can maybe tell you how well Ford was convinced to surrender.
[01:59:06.239 --> 01:59:07.080]  Yeah, we've got a break.
[01:59:07.080 --> 01:59:10.963]  We'll only have five minutes, but I want to also look forward to the next year.
[01:59:12.685 --> 01:59:17.795]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:59:22.870 --> 01:59:28.252]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:59:28.252 --> 01:59:36.595]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:59:36.595 --> 01:59:42.978]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear disaster.
[01:59:42.978 --> 01:59:43.499]  We're good.
[01:59:56.710 --> 02:00:03.655]  ...diet form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.

[02:00:23.303 --> 02:00:25.704]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:25.704 --> 02:00:34.969]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:34.969 --> 02:00:36.290]  Big Brother.
[02:00:36.290 --> 02:00:38.051]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:38.051 --> 02:00:39.812]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:39.812 --> 02:00:41.393]  You want answers?
[02:00:41.393 --> 02:00:42.953]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:42.953 --> 02:00:47.136]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:47.136 --> 02:00:51.218]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:52.973 --> 02:01:01.003]  Tony Gosling that runs the Big Bilderberg site has been to many of their meetings and covered it will be joining us coming up in about eight minutes.
[02:01:01.003 --> 02:01:02.485]  It'll be his maiden voyage with us.
[02:01:02.485 --> 02:01:03.486]  We appreciate him coming on.
[02:01:03.486 --> 02:01:05.369]  Webster Tarpley, I've got to get on for a full...
[02:01:06.474 --> 02:01:09.375]  Our two-hour interview in the near future joins us.
[02:01:09.375 --> 02:01:14.577]  We carry his great book, the third edition, 9-11 Synthetic Terror Made the U.S.A.
[02:01:14.577 --> 02:01:16.498]  at InfoWars.com.
[02:01:16.498 --> 02:01:18.598]  Online video and books for Webster.
[02:01:18.598 --> 02:01:31.483]  I think we've covered enough about Nixon and Bush and Ford and all those different machinations and skullduggery that went on in their Machiavellian world, but I want to look forward into the next year.
[02:01:31.483 --> 02:01:35.184]  You, I know, don't pull any punches and don't toot your own horn or my horn,
[02:01:36.436 --> 02:01:52.997]  But many, and C-SPAN admits their most highly viewed group of programs ever was the four re-airings, and since they've done it several other times, the hype that was generated and built up with the hour and 50 minute C-SPAN roundtable discussion we had,
[02:01:54.005 --> 02:01:58.087]  Pointing the finger, the other 9-11 shows that have been on there really haven't been that hardcore.
[02:01:58.087 --> 02:02:02.229]  We didn't pull any punches, and it's had a massive effect.
[02:02:02.229 --> 02:02:12.294]  I know you've been crediting that with breaking the 9-11 dam, and yes, since then we now see 84% of the national scientific poll not buying the official story.
[02:02:12.294 --> 02:02:13.074]  Do you want to speak to that?
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:26.269]  I would say that that conference that you put on, that panel that was put on C-SPAN and that you've also distributed, is the single most important ingredient in the outcome of the 2006 election.
[02:02:26.269 --> 02:02:28.651]  In other words, the defeat of Bush.
[02:02:28.651 --> 02:02:36.817]  The fact that the demagogy of terror, the terror hysteria that Bush had relied on to win that election once again,
[02:02:37.242 --> 02:02:37.543]  I think
[02:02:54.890 --> 02:02:57.732]  And they're talking about what Bush will announce next week.
[02:02:57.732 --> 02:03:04.857]  He's going to announce 20,000 or 30,000 more GIs to be sent into this desperate situation in Iraq.
[02:03:04.857 --> 02:03:09.241]  This sets the stage for a constitutional crisis of the first order, similar to Watergate.
[02:03:10.434 --> 02:03:14.475]  Involving impeachment, whatever poor Mrs. Pelosi thinks about it.
[02:03:14.475 --> 02:03:18.557]  Impeachment is on the table because the Constitution says it is.
[02:03:18.557 --> 02:03:20.337]  Right now there are 12... Hold on, hold on!
[02:03:20.337 --> 02:03:22.538]  Pelosi's holding back a dam!
[02:03:22.538 --> 02:03:30.141]  78% of Americans want out, 70% of the troops want out, and she can't even have a press conference because people are shouting them down at the Capitol.
[02:03:30.141 --> 02:03:37.143]  This is illustrating the shadow government, because Republicans and Democrats want us out of Iraq, but the elite says, no way!
[02:03:37.943 --> 02:03:42.226]  Mrs. Pelosi, I'm afraid, is infected with what I call parliamentary cretinism.
[02:03:42.226 --> 02:03:49.890]  In other words, she thinks that the main issue in governing is the atmosphere in the halls of Congress, whether they're having a tea party or a fistfight.
[02:03:49.890 --> 02:03:52.652]  Well, we don't care whether it's a tea party or a fistfight.
[02:03:52.652 --> 02:03:58.215]  We didn't vote for any bipartisan party, which she seems to think is what her task is.
[02:03:58.215 --> 02:04:02.698]  She was put there to fight Bush, and if she doesn't fight Bush, she will be swept away.
[02:04:03.197 --> 02:04:06.200]  Now, Bush is going to make this announcement next week.
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:11.384]  12% of the population supports the escalation surge into Iraq.
[02:04:11.384 --> 02:04:17.108]  The support in the Senate is down to 12 Republican senators, and the rest are opposed to this.
[02:04:17.108 --> 02:04:22.653]  And, of course, you've got the ruling class in its majority is against it, as we saw in the Baker-Hamilton
[02:04:23.529 --> 02:04:25.490]  Right now I see a split in the ruling class.
[02:04:25.490 --> 02:04:41.540]  There's a George Shultz group with Bush and the neocons and Limbaugh and the rest of these people on the one side, and on the other side you've got the Baker group, which are the moderate imperialists, and their line is, we can't just have it, the United States, Britain and Israel fight the world.
[02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:45.682]  We've got to recruit more puppet states, more Stooges, we've got to peel
[02:04:46.263 --> 02:04:56.672]  The Syrians away from Iran set up a Sunni Arab block of perhaps... Well, that's always been the plan is to generate sectarian violence with Brzezinski calling it now the Global Balkans.
[02:04:56.672 --> 02:04:58.233]  Webster, we're out of time.
[02:04:58.233 --> 02:05:01.075]  Do you think they're going to attack Iran soon?
[02:05:01.075 --> 02:05:07.260]  Well, the Senate is on its way and what we're calling for is, obviously, filibuster Negroponte.
[02:05:07.260 --> 02:05:10.443]  Don't let Negroponte get through the Congress again.
[02:05:10.443 --> 02:05:15.107]  And set up preemptive oversight hearings about the coming attack on Iran.
[02:05:16.227 --> 02:05:18.468]  Alright, Webster Tarpley, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:05:18.468 --> 02:05:20.309]  I really appreciate you coming on with us.
[02:05:20.309 --> 02:05:22.451]  Thank you very much, Alex, and Happy New Year again.
[02:05:22.451 --> 02:05:22.891]  You too.
[02:05:22.891 --> 02:05:24.812]  Say hi to your wife and family for me.
[02:05:24.812 --> 02:05:30.896]  We'll be right back with Tony Gosling.
[02:05:30.896 --> 02:05:31.336]  Dad!
[02:05:31.963 --> 02:05:33.065]  Can we stop?
[02:05:33.065 --> 02:05:35.007]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:05:35.007 --> 02:05:35.628]  What?
[02:05:35.628 --> 02:05:36.389]  Again?
[02:05:36.389 --> 02:05:38.091]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:05:38.091 --> 02:05:39.393]  Honey, let's stop.
[02:05:39.393 --> 02:05:42.757]  Because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[02:05:42.757 --> 02:05:44.259]  Why did you do that?
[02:05:44.259 --> 02:05:46.682]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time.
[02:05:46.682 --> 02:05:49.987]  And that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:05:50.307 --> 02:05:51.468]  Are we there yet?
[02:05:51.468 --> 02:05:52.790]  For the entire trip.
[02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:53.711]  Hmm.
[02:05:53.711 --> 02:05:55.453]  I didn't think about that.
[02:05:55.453 --> 02:05:56.755]  Great idea!
[02:05:56.755 --> 02:05:57.376]  Yeah!
[02:05:57.376 --> 02:05:59.718]  And it's cheap entertainment for the kids!
[02:05:59.718 --> 02:06:02.382]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[02:06:02.382 --> 02:06:07.047]  And using our Berkey Sport Bottles, it costs us less than 2.5 cents per refill.
[02:06:07.047 --> 02:06:07.368]  Honey!
[02:06:08.180 --> 02:06:09.801]  You're terrific!
[02:06:09.801 --> 02:06:11.401]  Oh honey, so are you!
[02:06:11.401 --> 02:06:15.103]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[02:06:15.103 --> 02:06:16.383]  Now can we stop?
[02:06:16.383 --> 02:06:17.423]  I need to go too.
[02:06:17.423 --> 02:06:21.925]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:06:21.925 --> 02:06:22.185]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:06:22.185 --> 02:06:23.826]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:06:33.490 --> 02:06:39.299]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:06:39.299 --> 02:06:46.951]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:06:47.631 --> 02:06:55.094]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:06:55.094 --> 02:07:06.818]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:07:06.818 --> 02:07:10.780]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:07:10.780 --> 02:07:13.040]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:16.882]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:07:32.153 --> 02:07:36.518]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:07:36.518 --> 02:07:38.540]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:07:38.540 --> 02:07:45.127]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:07:45.127 --> 02:07:51.494]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:07:51.494 --> 02:07:53.336]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:07:53.596 --> 02:07:54.017]  I think so.
[02:08:16.179 --> 02:08:20.142]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:09:02.793 --> 02:09:04.374]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:04.374 --> 02:09:07.534]  Now eight minutes, thirty seconds into this third hour today.
[02:09:07.534 --> 02:09:10.795]  And there's so much on the Bilderberg
[02:09:11.827 --> 02:09:16.713]  Uh, website that I don't even really know where to start.
[02:09:16.713 --> 02:09:21.558]  Uh, Tony, uh, Gosling, uh, for years has been going to different Bilderberg meetings and covering it.
[02:09:22.904 --> 02:09:27.308]  He has just been an invaluable resource in that, and he joins us today.
[02:09:27.308 --> 02:09:30.110]  He's at, I believe, a London restaurant.
[02:09:30.110 --> 02:09:36.635]  So that's the background noise you'll hear, but it's always good to bring in some London atmosphere to the international audience.
[02:09:36.635 --> 02:09:37.976]  Tony, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:09:37.976 --> 02:09:40.658]  I hate to disappoint you, but we're actually down in Bristol.
[02:09:40.658 --> 02:09:44.501]  We're in London, but we're in a nice little Lebanese restaurant here.
[02:09:44.501 --> 02:09:48.804]  But I can tell you that this year at Bilderberg we're going to have a real first, because it's the first time we've ever had
[02:09:49.304 --> 02:09:53.985]  A dedicated internet forum which is going to be chasing them down.
[02:09:53.985 --> 02:10:11.648]  The idea being obviously, you know, just to give Jim a bit of a hand, Jim Tucker, a bit of a hand from this side of the pond in tracking down exactly where they are because every year it seems to get more and more difficult, more and more secretive to actually, you know, to discover the correct venue because there's all sorts of false leads go out and that kind of thing.
[02:10:11.648 --> 02:10:18.469]  So on the old Bilderberg.org there's now a forum where people can discuss that which is working really quite nicely.
[02:10:19.525 --> 02:10:23.387]  On there, you'll see that there are two main suspected countries where it's going to be this year.
[02:10:23.387 --> 02:10:26.048]  Obviously, it's not going to be over your side.
[02:10:26.048 --> 02:10:31.390]  It's going to be for people who are familiar with the Bilderberg, and they'll know that it's going to be in Europe somewhere.
[02:10:31.390 --> 02:10:34.051]  It's either Turkey or France, it looks like at the moment.
[02:10:34.051 --> 02:10:37.872]  But then, you know, we're never quite sure if people are tossing false leads.
[02:10:37.872 --> 02:10:39.733]  Yeah, we were here until the last minute.
[02:10:41.039 --> 02:10:57.855]  This year that it was going to be in either Austria or Canada obviously it was in Ottawa the capital of Canada and I was there you've been to a lot of the European meetings I guess every four years it's in North America but usually
[02:10:59.576 --> 02:11:02.939]  Three-fourths of the time, it is in Europe.
[02:11:02.939 --> 02:11:09.264]  But Tony, for those that don't know who you are, tell us how you got involved in this, and then what Bilderberg is.
[02:11:09.264 --> 02:11:18.532]  We've gone from the media saying it didn't exist, you were crazy if you talked about it, to it now being in the BBC and CBC and ABC Nightly News and CNN.
[02:11:18.532 --> 02:11:21.995]  So walk us through, just in a nutshell, kind of a thumbnail sketch
[02:11:23.577 --> 02:11:24.117]  We're good.
[02:11:33.582 --> 02:11:40.567]  Well, first of all, I'm Vice Chairman of the National Union of Journalists in Bristol, so I'm in touch with a lot of journalists around here.
[02:11:40.567 --> 02:11:45.390]  And myself, I was originally working for the BBC as a reporter.
[02:11:45.390 --> 02:11:54.617]  Now, I found it was very difficult to do exactly what I wanted to do, working within there, but I feel a lot freer as a freelancer, and I just picked up on some of the stuff to do with the Bilderberg meetings.
[02:11:55.417 --> 02:12:00.542]  When someone first told me about them, I really thought, hang on a minute, you know, this can't be true.
[02:12:00.542 --> 02:12:05.306]  And when I dug into it and found it was, I thought, well, let's get something up on the internet about this.
[02:12:05.306 --> 02:12:10.010]  Because it just seemed that this is a sort of early mid-90s, the internet was arriving just at the right time.
[02:12:11.131 --> 02:12:14.072]  Well, you could kind of do this sort of thing.
[02:12:14.072 --> 02:12:17.354]  So that's really how it all started and it's kind of gone on from there.
[02:12:17.354 --> 02:12:30.582]  I'm now quite active in the UK 9-11 Truth Movement and I understand, as Webster and many other people do, that 9-11 is at the root and the foundation of this bogus war on terror and by pulling apart 9-11 and similar type attacks,
[02:12:32.503 --> 02:12:39.169]  That this is the way that we have to sort of get the truth out and to fight the bogusness of it all.
[02:12:39.169 --> 02:12:51.940]  I mean we just heard in the Daily Telegraph just before Christmas that this is an official number 10 policy unit is now recommending microchipping of people as a way of helping to solve crime.
[02:12:51.940 --> 02:12:55.723]  So for years and years people thought that this was kind of some sort of fiction.
[02:12:55.723 --> 02:12:57.064]  Actually now it's turning out to be
[02:12:57.623 --> 02:13:00.304]  You know, this is now official number 10 policy.
[02:13:00.304 --> 02:13:01.325]  This is unbelievable.
[02:13:01.325 --> 02:13:07.768]  But yeah, I mean, people like me have been talking about this kind of thing for, and you of course, Alex, have been talking about this sort of stuff for years.
[02:13:07.768 --> 02:13:17.633]  I've also had a very, what I think is quite an important article in the National Union of Journalists journal, which is called, amazingly enough, imaginatively enough, Journalist, The Journalist.
[02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:31.644]  And that was over Christmas and that was about the London attacks, raising all the sorts of questions that many people who are sort of part of the 9-11 truth movement have been talking about for a long, long time.
[02:13:31.644 --> 02:13:40.246]  And we're talking about things like the fact that the photoshopped image from Luton showing these four guys
[02:13:40.819 --> 02:13:44.381]  The fact that there's no real evidence that they were actually on the Tube network at all that day.
[02:13:44.381 --> 02:13:49.203]  The fact that there was a warning given beforehand to the Israeli Embassy.
[02:13:49.203 --> 02:13:50.784]  You know, this sort of stuff all fits together.
[02:13:50.784 --> 02:13:57.286]  And what I'm basically saying there is that we need to be very, very, very wary about this term suicide bomber.
[02:13:57.286 --> 02:14:01.028]  I mean, if anyone remembers back to April in 2004, they will know
[02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:11.662]  That was when the Shiite insurgency started, because the al-Sada newspaper in Baghdad was closed down by the US Army.
[02:14:11.662 --> 02:14:14.803]  A bunch of soldiers turned up in Humvees and closed it down.
[02:14:14.803 --> 02:14:21.145]  Because the previous edition of the paper, it had a front page lead headline saying that a suicide bomber
[02:14:22.184 --> 02:14:28.746]  Uh, was in fact nothing of the sort, and that they had 13 eyewitnesses saying that actually it was a helicopter firing a missile.
[02:14:28.746 --> 02:14:38.269]  Now, if the military forces are able to get away with pulling the wool over journalists' eyes in the heat of the moment in that fashion, I think we need to be extremely wary.
[02:14:38.269 --> 02:14:42.850]  And every time that we hear the term suicide bomber, we need to actually go and check the facts.
[02:14:42.850 --> 02:14:46.091]  Is this a suicide bomber, or is this something else going on?
[02:14:46.091 --> 02:14:49.152]  Because this is what is being used, certainly in this country,
[02:14:49.651 --> 02:14:55.082]  I mean, I really don't know quite what it's like over in the States, but to demonize Muslims in all sorts of ways.
[02:14:55.082 --> 02:14:57.867]  And now they're starting to bring that demonization to Christians too.
[02:14:59.824 --> 02:15:04.948]  Tony Gosling runs the biggest Bilderberg site out there, Bilderberg.org.
[02:15:04.948 --> 02:15:17.538]  Tony, for those that don't know, describe how Bilderberg was founded from your research, what its main goals are, and is there really an internal split in it, and has it gotten larger since the eve of the Gulf War four years ago?
[02:15:17.538 --> 02:15:26.706]  Well, Alex, I think there are some splits going on, and certainly, Bilderberg is having, well, the people connected with it are having all sorts of problems with the Russians at the moment.
[02:15:26.706 --> 02:15:29.348]  I think that's what's actually behind this polonium scandal in London.
[02:15:30.249 --> 02:15:35.493]  The Build-A-Bloat Ratings actually started back in, for those that don't know, back in 1954.
[02:15:35.493 --> 02:15:46.443]  They were convened originally by several characters, a guy called Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, who was, at the beginning of the war, was actually in the Nazi SS.
[02:15:47.646 --> 02:15:55.613]  And this is the thing that actually really switched me on to this whole business is hang on a minute, if this guy was organized by an ex-SS man, how come nobody's interested in it?
[02:15:55.613 --> 02:16:03.660]  You know, well maybe that's because there's some also other ex-SS people protecting and of course today you can find the remnants of SS in NATO intelligence.
[02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:07.764]  A lot of the behavior of the Gladio operations were basically just
[02:16:08.523 --> 02:16:12.409]  Well, the Bushes made their first bank off of being top Nazi bag men in the U.S., so these remnants are everywhere.
[02:16:21.710 --> 02:16:38.382]  That's right, and also the other guy who was involved in the formation of the Bilderbergs originally, he was, I'm trying to remember his name, I can't remember it off hand, but anyway, he was mentioned by Stephen Dorrell in his history of MI6 as someone who had constantly been an MI6 agent.
[02:16:38.382 --> 02:16:42.225]  He was also implicated in the death of General Sikorski.
[02:16:42.225 --> 02:16:46.448]  General Sikorski, you know, was the representative of Poland during World War II.
[02:16:47.428 --> 02:16:49.969]  And, um, I died mysteriously in an accident.
[02:16:49.969 --> 02:17:03.092]  Now, this is a bit bizarre, but actually it was the Polish that we went into World War II, Britain led the world into World War II to stop the Nazi invasion of Poland, and yet by the end of it we were stabbing the leader of Poland in the back.
[02:17:03.092 --> 02:17:09.194]  So, I mean, that gives you an idea of the kind of shenanigans that go over on these kind of big issues over the wall.
[02:17:09.194 --> 02:17:12.075]  So, you know, it just seems to me that, um,
[02:17:12.615 --> 02:17:19.857]  That the beginning of Bilderberg is mired in intrigue and actually quite, you know, some quite horrendous facts.
[02:17:19.857 --> 02:17:22.417]  And these people who were involved in putting it together were.
[02:17:22.417 --> 02:17:25.178]  So, immediately, that set the legs up for me.
[02:17:25.178 --> 02:17:27.238]  This is something that needs to be a proper investigation.
[02:17:27.238 --> 02:17:28.438]  Sure.
[02:17:28.438 --> 02:17:29.939]  How many years ago was that, Tony?
[02:17:29.939 --> 02:17:32.299]  I mean, how many years ago did you start following it?
[02:17:32.299 --> 02:17:34.079]  How many Bilderberg meetings have you been to?
[02:17:34.079 --> 02:17:41.281]  When I first decided to do something, because I was actually in Wandsworth in London, right next to the River Thames.
[02:17:42.001 --> 02:17:43.962]  And we had decided to take over some land.
[02:17:43.962 --> 02:17:47.884]  We were squatting some land as a protest action about the building of a supermarket.
[02:17:47.884 --> 02:17:52.286]  And also saying that we want more eco-friendly buildings in the city.
[02:17:52.286 --> 02:17:55.187]  It's a 17 acre site that had been owned by Guinness.
[02:17:56.064 --> 02:17:56.564]  And this is in 1996.
[02:17:56.564 --> 02:18:03.329]  We actually took the place over in the beginning of the year.
[02:18:03.329 --> 02:18:06.731]  I think it was about April, March, April time.
[02:18:06.731 --> 02:18:18.459]  I managed to actually get a community going on there of about 40, 50 people who actually built their own homes with growing vegetables, all this kind of thing, on what was an ex-factory site.
[02:18:18.459 --> 02:18:22.142]  Actually it was very, very fertile land and we had all sorts of growing going on.
[02:18:22.142 --> 02:18:23.402]  And we got quite a bit of news coverage.
[02:18:23.402 --> 02:18:24.203]  Anyway, one of the chaps
[02:18:24.807 --> 02:18:28.669]  He'd seen us on the news and came to have a chat with us.
[02:18:28.669 --> 02:18:31.911]  Somebody who'd obviously knew about the Bilderbergers.
[02:18:31.911 --> 02:18:32.812]  He said, well, hang on a minute.
[02:18:33.514 --> 02:18:37.256]  You know, you're looking at the land issue here, but you've got to also look at the money issue.
[02:18:37.256 --> 02:18:38.516]  What about the issue of money?
[02:18:38.516 --> 02:18:42.017]  You know, this is another massive problem that needs to be sorted out in the world.
[02:18:42.017 --> 02:18:46.859]  And I listened to him, he sounds like a very sensible chap, but at the end of it, he mentioned this organisation, he said, the Bilderbergs.
[02:18:46.859 --> 02:18:50.821]  No one even knows about them, but they really run the Western world.
[02:18:50.821 --> 02:18:52.421]  And I thought, hang on, what are you talking about?
[02:18:52.421 --> 02:18:54.662]  You know, this sounds like some kind of fantasy.
[02:18:54.662 --> 02:18:58.204]  But then I, when I got back to the office, dutifully checked up what he'd said.
[02:18:58.204 --> 02:19:01.165]  I thought I'd have a little search on the internet and had a little, had a trawl through
[02:19:01.645 --> 02:19:09.529]  All the article database of Reuters, and I found lots of very, very, what I would call incriminating evidence about them, which I then cut and paste and put on the web.
[02:19:09.529 --> 02:19:16.252]  So that was how it kind of started in the first place, and it's just taken off from there, with all sorts of other things kind of being looked at now.
[02:19:16.252 --> 02:19:28.818]  I mean, at the moment, for example, I'm doing an investigation into the fact that Tony Blair lied in the House of Commons when he talked about not going to a Bilderberg meeting with Norman Baker, who's a Liberal MP,
[02:19:29.534 --> 02:19:43.628]  Asked a question in the Commons and another Liberal Lord asked a similar question in the Lords and they both got, really what I would say was either, I think in the Lords it was a kind of unequivocal like neither confirming or denying.
[02:19:43.628 --> 02:19:46.931]  But Blair actually said no I've never been.
[02:19:46.931 --> 02:19:54.058]  Now I actually spoke to the woman who served Tony Blair his breakfast at the Turnberry Conference so I'm absolutely certain he was there.
[02:19:54.788 --> 02:19:58.069]  Um, and, uh, so, why is he actually doing this?
[02:19:58.069 --> 02:20:10.431]  Well, I mean, I'm now, uh, working with Norman Baker on an investigation, and then hopefully we can, uh, get, get some, uh, get Mr. Blair to retract his lie, you know, because it's absolutely not on.
[02:20:10.431 --> 02:20:14.372]  Uh, I don't understand why it is that he has to even say that he's had nothing to do with it.
[02:20:14.372 --> 02:20:16.332]  It seems clearly that he has.
[02:20:16.332 --> 02:20:17.632]  Tony Gosling, stay there.
[02:20:17.632 --> 02:20:21.753]  I want to come back and talk about a few articles you've done lately about Prince Charles.
[02:20:22.722 --> 02:20:24.183]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:20:24.183 --> 02:20:28.366]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:20:28.366 --> 02:20:33.530]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:20:33.530 --> 02:20:34.711]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:20:48.012 --> 02:20:53.533]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:20:53.533 --> 02:21:01.795]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:21:01.795 --> 02:21:05.095]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[02:21:05.095 --> 02:21:11.456]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[02:21:22.897 --> 02:21:23.157]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:31.412 --> 02:21:33.993]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:21:33.993 --> 02:21:39.256]  Did you know that the Bible forecasts signs to let us know that we're in the last days?
[02:21:39.256 --> 02:21:46.699]  The book of Revelation says that world travel, quickly and efficiently, would be one sign, and also knowledge would increase.
[02:21:46.699 --> 02:21:50.081]  Knowledge is doubling every two and a half years in the electronic industry.
[02:21:50.681 --> 02:21:59.145]  We'd like to help you understand more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:22:33.881 --> 02:22:36.981]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:22:36.981 --> 02:22:43.563]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:23:30.476 --> 02:23:31.597]  It's no secret.
[02:23:31.597 --> 02:23:37.261]  Aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable of causing DNA damage.
[02:23:37.261 --> 02:23:42.364]  Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects.
[02:23:42.364 --> 02:23:44.866]  So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[02:23:44.866 --> 02:23:47.708]  Well, there is an alternative and it's called NoVO.
[02:23:47.708 --> 02:23:56.033]  NoVO eliminates the bacterial growth, which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration, which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins.
[02:23:56.033 --> 02:24:00.216]  There are no chemicals, aluminum, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients in NoVO.
[02:24:00.576 --> 02:24:06.957]  Just natural ingredients like grapeseed oil, arrowroot powder, silica, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and geranium.
[02:24:06.957 --> 02:24:11.278]  No-BO's job is to destroy the bacteria that causes the odor while soothing your skin.
[02:24:11.278 --> 02:24:15.799]  You can use No-BO under your arms, on tough foot odors, or for athlete's foot.
[02:24:15.799 --> 02:24:20.120]  No-BO is guaranteed 100% or receive a full refund.
[02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:22.801]  Visit No-BO.com to order.
[02:24:22.801 --> 02:24:25.601]  That's No-BO.com or call 850-723-8599.
[02:24:31.107 --> 02:24:34.429]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:24:34.429 --> 02:24:47.937]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:47.937 --> 02:24:49.878]  Tony Gosling's our guest.
[02:24:49.878 --> 02:24:53.200]  He runs Bilderberg.org.
[02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:55.901]  And he's been to quite a few of the meetings.
[02:24:55.901 --> 02:24:59.183]  He has witnessed some of the police state tactics of Bilderberg Group.
[02:25:00.555 --> 02:25:04.399]  Tony, people like Jim Tucker have been shot at before.
[02:25:04.399 --> 02:25:08.442]  He's been grabbed in Italy and taken away for hours and hours.
[02:25:08.442 --> 02:25:10.004]  Daniel Estolano has been detained.
[02:25:10.004 --> 02:25:15.729]  I have obviously been detained in Canada because they said the Bilderberg Group was concerned about me.
[02:25:16.616 --> 02:25:28.183]  I mean, if anybody doubts that these people aren't for freedom, why are they so angry at people like yourself, Jim Tucker, Daniel Escalante, myself and others, that try to cover and report on Bilderberg?
[02:25:28.183 --> 02:25:35.787]  I mean, the old cliché is, if you've got, you know, 125 top football players meeting, the media would be there.
[02:25:35.787 --> 02:25:39.069]  Or 125 top Hollywood people, there'd be media beating down the doors.
[02:25:39.069 --> 02:25:42.351]  Or 125 scientists, people would wonder why.
[02:25:42.351 --> 02:25:43.111]  You've got 125 royalty, robber barons,
[02:25:46.093 --> 02:25:48.876]  Well, I mean, I've found them to be quite reasonable, really.
[02:25:48.876 --> 02:25:55.124]  The fact that they won't send me any information, generally speaking, about who's been at the meetings is a real problem.
[02:26:06.757 --> 02:26:08.958]  But, I mean, I haven't been shot at.
[02:26:08.958 --> 02:26:16.583]  You know, I've only been, well, I would say, sort of questioned by the secret police at various places I've been to.
[02:26:16.583 --> 02:26:17.883]  And I haven't really had any hassle.
[02:26:17.883 --> 02:26:25.587]  But, I mean, my approach to the Bilderbergers is always that, you know, I want to give them a way out of what they're doing.
[02:26:25.587 --> 02:26:34.012]  Because it seems to me that there must be people within the Bilderberg and similar organisations and those connected with them that don't actually take their point of view.
[02:26:35.048 --> 02:26:44.892]  And so therefore I don't really want to stand point the finger and condemn because I mean although they're obviously involved in all sorts of dangerous nefarious stuff.
[02:26:44.892 --> 02:26:53.535]  I don't actually want to you know I'm not I don't want to be the person to condemn them I want to expose what they're doing expose the facts and that's really what it's all about for me.
[02:26:54.339 --> 02:27:00.248]  Um, and also I think if you, if you, if, you know, last thing I want to do is to start to demonize them anymore.
[02:27:00.248 --> 02:27:03.672]  You know, they may be demons, but that's not for me to decide.
[02:27:03.672 --> 02:27:08.159]  I don't want to do that demonizing, and I want to always make sure that they have got a way out.
[02:27:08.159 --> 02:27:11.223]  My approach is really, look, you really shouldn't be doing this.
[02:27:11.927 --> 02:27:13.929]  Uh, and isn't it better that you just walk away from this?
[02:27:13.929 --> 02:27:17.233]  Now, they may not do that, but that's still my approach, and it always will be.
[02:27:17.233 --> 02:27:27.664]  Now, I notice you told my radio producer, and you sent us a few articles that you put together, or others you're covering, about Prince Charles and bizarre occultic things that is property.
[02:27:28.568 --> 02:27:30.989]  And why do you think that's important?
[02:27:30.989 --> 02:27:32.109]  I think it's important.
[02:27:32.109 --> 02:27:33.430]  I, of course, have covered it.
[02:27:33.430 --> 02:27:37.472]  How often does the occult pop up when you're researching these people?
[02:27:37.472 --> 02:27:47.195]  Well, I mean, all you have to do... Actually, I mean, I'm in Bristol in southwest England, and just the other side of the M4 motorway is where Prince Charles' main country residence is.
[02:27:47.195 --> 02:27:48.996]  When he's in London, he's in St.
[02:27:48.996 --> 02:27:51.377]  James's Palace, and it's very, very coastal, anyway.
[02:27:51.377 --> 02:27:53.938]  So I and some friends went on a ramble
[02:27:54.434 --> 02:27:57.496]  You know, sort of a little wonder over there towards the end of last year.
[02:27:57.496 --> 02:27:59.997]  And I actually couldn't believe my eyes.
[02:27:59.997 --> 02:28:10.202]  What I saw out in Prince Charles's back garden, which is a large field full of sheep, was a giant column with a carved metal phoenix on the top of it.
[02:28:10.202 --> 02:28:12.163]  And I think, what the hell is this doing here?
[02:28:12.163 --> 02:28:18.907]  And I obviously then got onto the good old Wikipedia and found that there was something on there that was absolutely identical to it.
[02:28:19.822 --> 02:28:24.606]  Um, so I think, you know, that that's exactly the kind of thing which is on the back of the US dollar.
[02:28:24.606 --> 02:28:32.792]  And it doesn't at all surprise me that maybe Prince Charles is into this kind of stuff, even though he's very publicly came out, come out and said he's not a Freemason.
[02:28:32.792 --> 02:28:38.797]  Um, well, maybe he's into something, uh, even more dodgy, you know, this is, this is certainly the way I see it.
[02:28:38.797 --> 02:28:43.040]  But I first got interested in Charles really looking into the Diana killing.
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:47.884]  Um, and I think it, you know, my personal feeling is definitely it was an assassination of some sort.
[02:28:48.471 --> 02:28:52.074]  Um, but there's all, there are, a lot of people give different reasons as to why this might have been.
[02:28:52.074 --> 02:28:56.317]  Now, it just so happens that a friend of my family used to work for MI6.
[02:28:56.317 --> 02:29:03.142]  Uh, her job was, um, seducing Middle Eastern leaders for, that was what she was paid to do, to get information.
[02:29:03.142 --> 02:29:05.484]  They call those swallows.
[02:29:05.484 --> 02:29:07.865]  Yeah, well, yeah, she was the honey trap, yeah?
[02:29:07.865 --> 02:29:11.128]  So, uh, anyway, she was getting information out of these people.
[02:29:11.128 --> 02:29:15.631]  And, um, she said, this was just, just literally a few weeks after the Dinah thing.
[02:29:16.547 --> 02:29:20.328]  We met her at a big family event.
[02:29:20.328 --> 02:29:24.049]  She had this real crowd about her.
[02:29:24.049 --> 02:29:27.550]  She was normally a very bubbly, happy, chappy lady.
[02:29:27.550 --> 02:29:31.872]  But she said, before we sit down and eat, I want to tell you a few things about Diana.
[02:29:31.872 --> 02:29:32.392]  MI6 did it.
[02:29:33.505 --> 02:29:47.230]  And the reasons she gave were various, but the main ones were, first of all, that the royal family had a real big downer on Diana's media and public profile.
[02:29:47.230 --> 02:29:53.592]  Everywhere that Charles and Diana went, and of course they were still going around together in the early days,
[02:29:54.458 --> 02:29:57.260]  In fact, when I was working for the BBC, I did some stuff.
[02:29:57.260 --> 02:30:02.144]  Tony Gosling, expert on Bilderberg Group and the New World Order activities is with us.
[02:30:02.144 --> 02:30:03.205]  Stay there, Tony.
[02:30:03.205 --> 02:30:04.166]  Big segment coming up.
[02:30:04.166 --> 02:30:15.774]  I want to get into this and talk about these secret societies and Princess Diana and her murder and what's on the Bilderberg agenda coming up in 2007 and a lot more on the other side.
[02:30:15.774 --> 02:30:16.575]  We'll be right back.
[02:30:21.053 --> 02:30:24.974]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:24.974 --> 02:30:30.756]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:30.756 --> 02:30:32.577]  What is the secret of the sea?
[02:30:32.577 --> 02:30:38.439]  It's the exciting food from the sea and it can be yours with nature's original superfood from Wachter's.
[02:30:38.439 --> 02:30:45.301]  This excellent exclusive blend of Wachter's sea vegetation is bursting with over 65 trace minerals and vitamins.
[02:30:45.301 --> 02:30:50.503]  Our sea vegetation contains 40 times more nutrients than any land grown vegetation.
[02:30:50.703 --> 02:31:02.349]  You would need almost 20 pounds of alfalfa, 10 pounds of spirulina, and 40 pounds of wheat to get the same nutritional value found in only one pound of Wachter's exclusive blend of sea plants.
[02:31:02.349 --> 02:31:07.431]  Over 75 years of experience has made Wachter's the leader in sea vegetation nutrition.
[02:31:07.711 --> 02:31:08.191]  I think so.
[02:31:30.976 --> 02:31:33.338]  Attention, attention everyone!
[02:31:33.338 --> 02:31:35.981]  A brand new invention just released.
[02:31:35.981 --> 02:31:37.722]  It's called Wristease.
[02:31:37.722 --> 02:31:40.685]  The new patented, portable, ergonomic wrist support.
[02:31:41.343 --> 02:31:48.687]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[02:31:48.687 --> 02:32:02.035]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[02:32:02.035 --> 02:32:02.875]  Wristease is perfect
[02:32:02.875 --> 02:32:03.155]  I think so.
[02:32:30.814 --> 02:32:31.595]  It's a fact.
[02:32:31.595 --> 02:32:36.478]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:32:36.478 --> 02:32:41.961]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[02:32:41.961 --> 02:32:45.423]  So why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours?
[02:32:45.423 --> 02:32:52.528]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[02:32:52.888 --> 02:33:00.516]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[02:33:00.516 --> 02:33:02.818]  We also do credit restoration.
[02:33:02.818 --> 02:33:09.364]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[02:33:09.364 --> 02:33:13.108]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[02:33:13.488 --> 02:33:16.110]  Call Day of Jubilee open 9 a.m.
[02:33:16.110 --> 02:33:16.991]  to 5 p.m.
[02:33:16.991 --> 02:33:18.391]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[02:33:18.391 --> 02:33:19.672]  That's 920-293-8024 and ask for Robert.
[02:33:19.672 --> 02:33:22.995]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[02:33:49.697 --> 02:34:02.382]  That's too much confusion!
[02:34:02.382 --> 02:34:04.463]  I can't get no relief!
[02:34:04.463 --> 02:34:08.465]  Alright, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:08.465 --> 02:34:16.128]  You know, my frustration is, over a decade ago, I came into possession of public documents in globalist think tank agreements
[02:34:16.815 --> 02:34:19.158]  That they were setting up a North American Union.
[02:34:19.158 --> 02:34:25.005]  I learned that the Bilderberg Group, 12 years ago plus, had set up the European Union.
[02:34:25.005 --> 02:34:25.966]  They bragged about it.
[02:34:26.565 --> 02:34:32.888]  And then I'd get on the radio and talk about it, and the media would say I was a crazy kook who believed in imaginary organizations.
[02:34:32.888 --> 02:34:40.212]  Now, because of Tony Gosling's work, and Jim Tucker, and Estalán, and many others, most people know that there really are global elites.
[02:34:40.212 --> 02:34:42.473]  They really are pushing for world government.
[02:34:42.473 --> 02:34:51.817]  They want to get rid of our national sovereignty, because by setting up new governmental systems, they can ensure that they don't have the checks and balances that England and the U.S.
[02:34:51.817 --> 02:34:52.818]  and other countries have had.
[02:34:53.667 --> 02:34:57.634]  The Magna Carta, Common Law, the Bill of Rights, Constitution.
[02:34:57.634 --> 02:35:05.127]  And there's no doubt from the minutes we've gotten, the documents we've gotten, that Bilderberg does want this One World Tax, One World Army, this whole system.
[02:35:06.196 --> 02:35:13.579]  And we need, you know, now that we can get the people to admit there's an elite, you know, folks in the past always knew there was one.
[02:35:13.579 --> 02:35:15.660]  Now we have this society in denial.
[02:35:15.660 --> 02:35:20.502]  Tony Gosling, joining us from England, what was it like for you when you learned of this?
[02:35:20.502 --> 02:35:24.443]  I mean, did you run into opposition, people who were still in denial?
[02:35:24.443 --> 02:35:27.364]  And then can you compare that now to the atmosphere?
[02:35:27.364 --> 02:35:28.665]  Are people more open to this?
[02:35:29.987 --> 02:35:32.651]  Well, look, I mean, I'm quite happy to run into people that disagree with me.
[02:35:32.651 --> 02:35:35.354]  I think that's actually quite a healthy world where people disagree with each other.
[02:35:35.354 --> 02:35:36.916]  I don't think everyone has to agree.
[02:35:36.916 --> 02:35:41.342]  And so it was something I was, you know, right from the beginning I was prepared for.
[02:35:41.342 --> 02:35:45.548]  But it just seems that more and more people do agree as time goes on.
[02:35:46.964 --> 02:36:08.540]  So, I mean really, I'm not surprised if people disagree, that's great, let them talk about it, but of course what happens is, in the years as I've just been talking about, with the number 10 talking about our microchip implants for British people, actually people say that this is impossible, but when they actually see it come to light then they suddenly remember, hang on, we were told about this all ten years ago, weren't we?
[02:36:09.613 --> 02:36:19.759]  So, you know, I think it's sort of inevitable, really, that slowly but surely, more and more members of the public and the media are coming to take our point of view, Alex.
[02:36:19.759 --> 02:36:24.702]  Tony, elaborate on that, because the Mexican government tried to make its employees take chips.
[02:36:24.702 --> 02:36:25.883]  Other governments are doing it.
[02:36:25.883 --> 02:36:28.084]  You were talking about new developments with that.
[02:36:28.084 --> 02:36:29.525]  Why don't you elaborate on it?
[02:36:29.525 --> 02:36:31.726]  Well, it was something that was in the Daily Telegraph.
[02:36:31.726 --> 02:36:34.508]  If people want to actually follow it up, they can go on to the British 9-11 Forum at
[02:36:38.422 --> 02:36:47.046]  9-11, that's N-I-N-E, that's the letters, not the numbers, 9-11 and then the word 11, .co.uk, and you can have a look there.
[02:36:47.046 --> 02:37:00.733]  But there's an article in the Daily Telegraph, just before Christmas I believe, or maybe just after Christmas, just before New Year, where this number 10 policy think tank has actually suggested that because they believe that there will be rising rates of crime due to economic
[02:37:01.705 --> 02:37:05.049]  I missed that article, but we're seeing similar ones in the U.S.
[02:37:05.049 --> 02:37:06.069]  I mean, this isn't a joke.
[02:37:06.069 --> 02:37:06.530]  This is happening.
[02:37:06.530 --> 02:37:10.414]  I think you missed the article as well, Alex, because the headline had nothing to do with that.
[02:37:10.414 --> 02:37:12.075]  It was saying something like fighting crime.
[02:37:27.156 --> 02:37:31.837]  Now, you and I would not necessarily associate putting a microchip in you with anything to do with fighting crime.
[02:37:31.837 --> 02:37:34.638]  So it's a toned-down headline in the Daily Telegraph.
[02:37:34.638 --> 02:37:39.039]  But once you got towards the bottom of the article, you realized, actually, this is what they're talking about.
[02:37:39.039 --> 02:37:47.222]  Well, there's an article today, it's in my stack, with a headline like, Local Schools Get Control!
[02:37:47.222 --> 02:37:53.343]  And then you read it and it says, the feds are making schools put cameras in coast-to-coast.
[02:37:53.343 --> 02:37:55.264]  I mean, it's always the opposite.
[02:37:56.266 --> 02:38:03.229]  But you've got journalists who are telling the truth, and editors who are coming along, or sub-editors, and then changing headlines and, you know, moving things around in that fashion.
[02:38:03.229 --> 02:38:09.873]  You know, but the fact is that more and more journalists are aware that there are these problems around, and they're trying to make sure that that stuff gets into the newspaper.
[02:38:09.873 --> 02:38:18.677]  How is the elite going to... How is the elite, Tony Gosselin, going to deal with that, the fact that people are now waking up to what they're doing?
[02:38:19.452 --> 02:38:30.565]  Well, there's actually no way I don't think they can deal with it, because ultimately their whole plan depends on deception, and I'm afraid their deception's failed, so ultimately they're on a hiding to nothing.
[02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:37.464]  Well, I agree with you in one respect, but in the other, it seems that they're going to deal with it with a police state.
[02:38:37.464 --> 02:38:39.866]  They're going, fine, you're waking up to what we're doing.
[02:38:39.866 --> 02:38:43.589]  We're just going to arrest you if you criticize us, claiming you're aiding terrorists.
[02:38:43.589 --> 02:38:45.611]  I don't think a global police state is ever going to happen.
[02:38:45.611 --> 02:38:48.213]  I mean, I know that sounds maybe a bit over optimistic.
[02:38:48.213 --> 02:38:50.215]  Well, I mean, they're saying we're only going to be made to take chips.
[02:38:50.894 --> 02:39:01.060]  The thing is that there are many, you know, we're still within the generations that can remember the Nazis, and certainly here in this country, most of the armed forces would absolutely have nothing to do with that.
[02:39:01.060 --> 02:39:04.983]  You might even find a military coup here in Britain if there was an attempt to bring in a police state.
[02:39:04.983 --> 02:39:14.049]  But they are, I mean, you've got four plus million cameras in London, they've got microphones going up, the police, every time I've got a video camera on it in the streets of London will walk up and take down my name.
[02:39:14.049 --> 02:39:17.411]  I mean, certainly the police state is starting to unfold right now.
[02:39:17.971 --> 02:39:30.095]  Slow, it's slow, but I mean, I don't think that the spirit that the people like the Bilderbergers and others who are going for a global police state, that the actual ordinary police in this country would never put up with that.
[02:39:30.095 --> 02:39:34.936]  I really don't... Well, I do think there is resistance, and that is good, and we need to be fully aware of it.
[02:39:34.936 --> 02:39:38.717]  Tell me, we were talking... An important point to make, because we need to be building alliances.
[02:39:38.717 --> 02:39:40.138]  I mean, for example, here in Britain,
[02:39:40.798 --> 02:39:49.060]  We had a big demonstration before Christmas at an RAF base, which is used to bring bodies back and to send troops out to Iraq.
[02:39:49.060 --> 02:39:57.541]  And literally, there were people, many people, families of the soldiers out on the streets, marching hand in hand with sort of anti-war demonstrators and campaigners.
[02:39:57.541 --> 02:40:00.122]  And then, you know, they're actually being politicised themselves.
[02:40:00.122 --> 02:40:07.023]  I mean, we had a big thing, a major news here in Britain yesterday was that the army are coming out, defending the conditions in which army
[02:40:07.603 --> 02:40:08.684]  We're good to go.
[02:40:31.796 --> 02:40:38.137]  You know, we need to not sort of demonize too much the armed forces, because after all, they were the same armed forces that defeated Hitler.
[02:40:38.137 --> 02:40:40.538]  Yeah, we're not demonizing you and I and others.
[02:40:40.538 --> 02:40:41.418]  Yeah, I know, some people do though.
[02:40:41.418 --> 02:40:45.279]  This is one of the things I find, is that people are very, very anti-military.
[02:40:45.279 --> 02:40:46.979]  And yeah, actually, we do need a strong military.
[02:40:46.979 --> 02:40:59.282]  Well, what we're trying to do is demonize those that are trying to misuse the military and police, and demonizing the police state tactics that are attempting to be implemented.
[02:40:59.282 --> 02:41:00.562]  Yeah, well, yeah, I totally agree.
[02:41:01.461 --> 02:41:07.143]  I mean, also though, I think it's important to get back to Diana, because I was just going to give you... We're going to do that in just a moment.
[02:41:07.143 --> 02:41:10.023]  In fact, that was one of the next things I was going to bring up.
[02:41:10.023 --> 02:41:17.145]  But Tony, before we run out of time, I want to go back to where you think Bilderberg may be held this year.
[02:41:17.145 --> 02:41:21.406]  It's getting harder and harder to find out each year, because they're getting more and more secretive.
[02:41:21.406 --> 02:41:23.047]  Can you speak to that briefly?
[02:41:23.047 --> 02:41:26.888]  Then I want to get to Diana, but then, because you live in England, you've written about it.
[02:41:27.248 --> 02:41:35.232]  Tony Blair having weird rebirthing ceremonies in southern Mexico at Aztec temples.
[02:41:35.232 --> 02:41:37.753]  Tony Blair channeling the light every morning.
[02:41:37.753 --> 02:41:38.954]  Tony Blair and the occult.
[02:41:38.954 --> 02:41:41.895]  I wanted to get your analysis on that.
[02:41:41.895 --> 02:41:43.396]  So can you speak to that first?
[02:41:43.396 --> 02:41:52.380]  There's a story that very, very few people have come across, which I find absolutely riveting, which has come from David Shaler and Annie Mashon, the two ex-MI5 agents.
[02:41:53.281 --> 02:42:07.415]  Now, when they first came out, because they basically were booted out because they started revealing the fact that the MI6 was funding al-Qaeda to assassinate Colonel Gaddafi.
[02:42:07.415 --> 02:42:16.243]  When they first came out, there was a big headline in the Sunday Telegraph, sorry, the Sunday Times, saying Shayla could bring down the government.
[02:42:17.066 --> 02:42:30.973]  And apparently at that point, and this is what they told me, on Monday morning the newspaper, the Mail on Sunday, let's get it right, the Mail on Sunday got a call from Number 10 Downing Street.
[02:42:30.973 --> 02:42:37.576]  Tony Blair phoned up the editor Jonathan Holbrook and demanded he come immediately to Downing Street.
[02:42:37.576 --> 02:42:45.100]  Now then Blair took him out into the garden, and of course you do that if you don't want to be bugged, and said to Jonathan Holbrook, what does Shayla know about me?
[02:42:45.100 --> 02:42:45.560]  Yes?
[02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:46.461]  What does Shayla know?
[02:42:47.493 --> 02:42:58.586]  And it turns out that Holbrooke then said to him, well I'm afraid we can't tell you because your government put an injunction on us last night and I can't tell you anything.
[02:42:58.586 --> 02:43:02.491]  But the fact was that Shayla and Nashorn, whilst they'd been at MI5,
[02:43:03.892 --> 02:43:05.855]  Yeah, in college he was recruited.
[02:43:21.162 --> 02:43:23.584]  He was in part of the campaign for nuclear disarmament.
[02:43:23.584 --> 02:43:26.266]  Yeah, well he was involved with communist groups, yeah.
[02:43:26.266 --> 02:43:34.112]  That's right, but he wasn't actually, you know, everyone was quite... How come this guy who used to be a kind of communist lefty is... but actually it turns out... He was an infiltrator.
[02:43:34.112 --> 02:43:41.457]  He was almost certain that he was actually, at the time, you know, just giving information... Uninformant.
[02:43:41.457 --> 02:43:42.238]  ...on these groups.
[02:43:42.238 --> 02:43:42.638]  Uninformant.
[02:43:42.638 --> 02:43:45.180]  He's the guy who's now supposed to be running this country.
[02:43:45.180 --> 02:43:45.981]  It's quite frightening.
[02:43:45.981 --> 02:43:50.264]  Well, it's like Putin running, Russia, Bush running, you know, it's all these former CIA people.
[02:43:50.805 --> 02:43:54.750]  Yeah, but I don't think Putin is in the same league as Blair, really.
[02:43:54.750 --> 02:44:02.539]  I mean, Putin has obviously decided that he's not really interested in the whole war on terror Western way of doing things, and he's separating himself from that in a way.
[02:44:02.539 --> 02:44:08.686]  I think he wants to, you know, reassert some sort of control over Russia, and that, I think, is very laudable of him.
[02:44:10.968 --> 02:44:16.534]  Tony, can you speak to when and where you think the meeting may be and how hard it's going to be?
[02:44:16.534 --> 02:44:21.660]  At this stage of the year we normally just don't know anyway but there's only two places that it looks like it may be at the moment.
[02:44:21.660 --> 02:44:26.927]  One is Turkey because one of the Turkish participants in last year's conference
[02:44:27.447 --> 02:44:31.950]  Well I'll tell you, Turkey is more of a police state than Europe and that might be a dangerous place for the
[02:44:53.982 --> 02:44:57.725]  For the press to go to cover it, are you going to go if it's in Turkey?
[02:44:57.725 --> 02:44:58.366]  Well, we'll see.
[02:44:58.366 --> 02:45:00.147]  I mean, I'm never quite sure whether I'm going to go or not.
[02:45:00.147 --> 02:45:02.529]  I usually make that decision quite late on.
[02:45:02.529 --> 02:45:04.211]  How many have you gone to?
[02:45:04.211 --> 02:45:07.273]  I've only been to, actually, to two meetings.
[02:45:07.273 --> 02:45:12.798]  But then, you know, one of the things I've always felt is one of the most fantastic things to go to the Bilderberg meeting.
[02:45:12.798 --> 02:45:20.545]  It may seem to people that it's not, but actually what happens is loads of people who are on the case with Bilderberg and with World Affairs generally,
[02:45:21.010 --> 02:45:24.646]  Get together in the various hotels, often in gyms, hotels, sometimes other places.
[02:45:25.494 --> 02:45:30.497]  You get reporters from all around the world sharing information, and it's almost like you've got a little alternative conference going on.
[02:45:30.497 --> 02:45:38.721]  So I'd recommend to everybody, wherever and whenever we find out where this meeting is going to be this year, that people can actually come along.
[02:45:38.721 --> 02:45:43.503]  And then we can have a sort of conflagration in a nearby hotel.
[02:45:43.503 --> 02:45:49.166]  And also it means there's more people to attract the attention of the national press in whichever country it happens.
[02:45:49.166 --> 02:45:52.328]  You know, it blew up in their face in Canada when they had me detained.
[02:45:52.328 --> 02:45:54.049]  That helped generate big headlines.
[02:45:54.890 --> 02:45:55.270]  Well, yeah.
[02:45:55.270 --> 02:45:57.712]  I mean, this is the sort of thing.
[02:45:57.712 --> 02:46:01.955]  The idea is really just to make sure that the local media are aware of it.
[02:46:01.955 --> 02:46:03.756]  That's what I always try and do.
[02:46:03.756 --> 02:46:05.477]  Now, you wanted to get into Diana.
[02:46:05.477 --> 02:46:09.120]  What, almost 80% of Brits think that somebody in the government killed them?
[02:46:09.120 --> 02:46:16.825]  We have the press reports where she said, Prince Charles says he's going to kill me in the next few months in a fake auto accident.
[02:46:17.185 --> 02:46:19.326]  She was speaking out against landmines.
[02:46:19.326 --> 02:46:21.287]  She was getting all the headlines.
[02:46:21.287 --> 02:46:23.047]  She was dating an Arab.
[02:46:23.047 --> 02:46:25.068]  I mean, they had a lot of reasons to kill her.
[02:46:25.068 --> 02:46:26.989]  The security tapes turned off.
[02:46:26.989 --> 02:46:30.770]  Now we know the driver was on intelligence payroll.
[02:46:30.770 --> 02:46:33.031]  Now we know the CIA was bugging them.
[02:46:33.031 --> 02:46:35.191]  I mean, this is really starting to come out.
[02:46:35.191 --> 02:46:36.452]  You've been on the case.
[02:46:36.452 --> 02:46:39.633]  What really happened from all the evidence you've got with Diana?
[02:46:40.033 --> 02:46:45.955]  What people don't always understand is that it's really a kind of jealousy from Charles.
[02:46:45.955 --> 02:46:54.138]  He could see that although they decided to part company and go their separate ways, Diana was really much more loved by both the press and the public.
[02:46:54.138 --> 02:47:03.040]  And that the public and the press both really saw him as the culprit for cheating on his wife and committing adultery with Camilla.
[02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:07.562]  And that Diana, as a virgin, going into that relationship, quite possibly,
[02:47:08.138 --> 02:47:13.440]  Uh, as the victim, you know, and I think most of the public understand that, you know, that, that he was really responsible for it.
[02:47:13.440 --> 02:47:17.881]  So that was, I think, the main, the main reason is because the press and public were very much behind Diana.
[02:47:17.881 --> 02:47:21.943]  And also she knew a lot about the inside workings of the, of the royal family.
[02:47:21.943 --> 02:47:33.907]  But reason number two, uh, was, uh, as one of the ones, and this is the way I would put, the order I would put them in, is that, uh, it was, she was, uh, an incredible link between the British people and the Muslim world.
[02:47:34.543 --> 02:47:45.286]  And, you know, the idea of her settling down as she was about to announce her engagement with Dodi the next day when they flew back to the UK, I mean, that is actually very well documented.
[02:47:45.286 --> 02:47:55.389]  And the police actually tried to persuade, I don't know if people know about this, the police tried to persuade the guy who sold them the engagement ring that it wasn't an engagement ring, you know, as part of the inquiry afterwards.
[02:47:55.389 --> 02:47:57.830]  Of course, he kept saying, yes, it was an engagement ring.
[02:47:57.830 --> 02:48:03.472]  I mean, no one's really quite sure to what extent they were leaning on him, but, you know, this would have been a big, big problem.
[02:48:04.016 --> 02:48:18.488]  And it does make you think that maybe the things that we're seeing now, the pogrom against the Muslim population around the world, the blaming them like the Nazis blamed the Jews, was being contemplated at that time, well before 9-11.
[02:48:18.488 --> 02:48:21.470]  And they knew that she'd speak out against it.
[02:48:21.470 --> 02:48:23.532]  Didn't Diana know how much danger she was in?
[02:48:23.532 --> 02:48:26.034]  She told friends, Charles says he's going to kill me in a fake...
[02:48:26.474 --> 02:48:30.015]  Well, I've seen pictures of her actually doing this landmine stuff.
[02:48:30.015 --> 02:48:34.416]  I think she was an incredibly courageous woman, and she knew that she was putting her life on the line for her country.
[02:48:48.587 --> 02:48:52.029]  And I think most of the British public also feel that.
[02:48:52.029 --> 02:49:04.518]  Anyone that actually takes the trouble to look into this, and doesn't come from the Prince Charles camp, of course he's spent a massive amount on trying to make sure that, and of course we had the coroner resign as well, the royal coroner resign.
[02:49:04.518 --> 02:49:08.761]  What do the children think, I mean, about their father murdering their mother?
[02:49:08.761 --> 02:49:10.962]  Well that's the $64,000 question, isn't it?
[02:49:10.962 --> 02:49:13.184]  I mean, you've got, obviously, these children.
[02:49:14.254 --> 02:49:14.995]  I don't know.
[02:49:27.052 --> 02:49:47.256]  And I don't know if people have heard the Diana tapes, I know they had an NBC special a few years ago, but I actually grabbed the audio off of that and it's fascinating to listen to Diana talking in her own words about her relationship with Charles, the confrontation with Camilla, and the way that she got over the bulimia and kind of became much stronger again as a person.
[02:49:47.256 --> 02:49:52.897]  And of course that was what the Royal Family couldn't bear, the fact that she was independent and strong and well loved by the public.
[02:49:54.207 --> 02:49:58.691]  But they keep having fake inquests, fake investigations, but the British people aren't buying it.
[02:49:58.691 --> 02:50:00.712]  That's got to make the establishment angry.
[02:50:00.712 --> 02:50:02.914]  It wasn't really, I don't think, a fake inquest.
[02:50:02.914 --> 02:50:12.402]  What's happened with the inquest is the coroner, it appears, has been very severely lent on to find a particular verdict, and has decided instead of that that he's going to resign.
[02:50:12.402 --> 02:50:13.382]  That's what happened.
[02:50:13.382 --> 02:50:15.684]  Was she really pregnant?
[02:50:15.684 --> 02:50:17.786]  Well, according to my wife's ex-friend, yes she was.
[02:50:18.693 --> 02:50:19.094]  I don't
[02:50:38.815 --> 02:50:40.696]  Almost relish in operating.
[02:50:40.696 --> 02:50:49.581]  They know that the worse deeds they do, the more disgusting those deeds are, the less that any of the members of the public and press are going to want to go there.
[02:50:49.581 --> 02:50:53.003]  So this is a kind of psychological tool.
[02:50:53.003 --> 02:51:02.248]  And the worse things you do, the more disgusting, the more terrible things you do, the less people are going to want to actually even consider that that would be possible.
[02:51:02.248 --> 02:51:06.831]  Because they play on people's ideas that actually people's human nature would never ever do such things.
[02:51:07.661 --> 02:51:12.586]  And of course we know from the Nazis, of course, that they do.
[02:51:12.586 --> 02:51:13.366]  We do know that.
[02:51:13.366 --> 02:51:15.348]  Unbelievable interview with Tony Gosling.
[02:51:15.348 --> 02:51:17.450]  Final segment in just a few minutes on the other side.
[02:51:17.450 --> 02:51:19.272]  Any other key points you want to add, sir?
[02:51:19.272 --> 02:51:25.937]  Bilderberg.org, an invaluable resource for those that want to know who the enemies of free peoples everywhere are.
[02:51:25.937 --> 02:51:27.739]  And it's done from a very objective view.
[02:51:27.739 --> 02:51:28.660]  Be sure and check it out.
[02:51:33.823 --> 02:51:39.648]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:51:39.648 --> 02:51:47.295]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:51:47.972 --> 02:51:55.436]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:51:55.436 --> 02:52:07.163]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:07.163 --> 02:52:11.145]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:11.145 --> 02:52:13.407]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:13.407 --> 02:52:17.229]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:52:35.681 --> 02:52:36.262]  Anthrax.
[02:52:36.262 --> 02:52:38.663]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[02:52:38.663 --> 02:52:40.504]  Alarming words for our time.

[02:54:48.797 --> 02:54:50.098]  Welcome back!
[02:54:50.098 --> 02:54:56.120]  Tony Gosling, Mildeberg.org, I'm really honored to be
[02:55:14.298 --> 02:55:16.439]  Talking to him here live today on this Friday edition.
[02:55:16.439 --> 02:55:18.940]  I'll be back Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:55:18.940 --> 02:55:22.101]  Central Standard Time for the new Sunday syndicated show we've been doing.
[02:55:22.101 --> 02:55:26.642]  If you don't have an Amorath affiliate in your area, you can always listen at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:26.642 --> 02:55:28.343]  We're off the Genesis streams.
[02:55:28.343 --> 02:55:29.904]  Tony, we've got about a minute or two left.
[02:55:29.904 --> 02:55:31.744]  Any other key points you want to hit on?
[02:55:31.744 --> 02:55:34.005]  Well, I want to say some more positive stuff as well.
[02:55:34.005 --> 02:55:39.427]  I mentioned that I didn't think that the New World Order was going to be all that successful here in Britain.
[02:55:39.427 --> 02:55:42.548]  We have this whole business of the ID card scheme that they're trying to impose on us.
[02:55:43.306 --> 02:55:50.129]  And it's clear now that we've got three, four million people in Britain who are prepared to go to jail rather than accept these damn things.
[02:55:50.129 --> 02:55:51.070]  Well, that's failed!
[02:55:51.070 --> 02:55:53.111]  It's failed six times to pass it!
[02:55:53.111 --> 02:56:00.475]  Yeah, so, I mean, it seems that they can maybe even pass the legislation to get these things in place, but no one is actually going to do it.
[02:56:00.475 --> 02:56:03.256]  It's almost like the law has become this kind of farce.
[02:56:03.897 --> 02:56:21.307]  So, you know, there's a very strong consciousness as well, I think it's fair to say, in the armed forces in Britain, through my contacts I can tell you, of this idea of false flag terrorism and that maybe this isn't in the media as much as it should be, but certainly the army and the armed forces, the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy are very much
[02:56:22.348 --> 02:56:29.433]  We've gone from people not being aware of government-sponsored terror to it now being something that's understood.
[02:56:29.433 --> 02:56:43.024]  We've had state terrorism for many, many years with the state imposing its will, but what we haven't had so much, and it's been behind the scenes, obviously the Gladio operations,
[02:56:43.624 --> 02:56:44.104]  Yes.
[02:56:44.104 --> 02:56:47.126]  Tony Gosling, we're going to have to get you back on soon.
[02:56:47.126 --> 02:56:48.707]  Bilderberg.org is the website.
[02:56:48.707 --> 02:56:49.387]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[02:57:10.058 --> 02:57:15.684]  OK, I just want to say one little thing and plug a game, which is a War on Terror, the board game.
[02:57:15.684 --> 02:57:23.993]  And I thought this was going to come along, but it's just, I don't know if people over there have seen it, but it's something that a bunch of game designers here in Britain have put together, and you can actually buy it on the web.
[02:57:23.993 --> 02:57:31.521]  So it's a kind of board game you can play with your family and sort of pretend to fight on a global scale and try and take over the world.
[02:57:32.723 --> 02:57:33.203]  Interesting.
[02:57:33.203 --> 02:57:34.704]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[02:57:34.704 --> 02:57:36.205]  No problem.
[02:57:36.205 --> 02:57:36.505]  You bet.
[02:57:36.505 --> 02:57:37.726]  Tony Gosling.
[02:57:37.726 --> 02:57:39.467]  Alright, the last minute and a half we have left here.

[02:59:20.822 --> 02:59:21.743]  Terrorism.
[02:59:21.743 --> 02:59:22.583]  Terrorism.
[02:59:22.583 --> 02:59:28.906]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[02:59:28.906 --> 02:59:30.747]  Alarming words for our time.
[02:59:30.747 --> 02:59:33.609]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
