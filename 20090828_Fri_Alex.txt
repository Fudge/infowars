[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.120]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.120 --> 00:24.840]  Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome the weekend is here
[00:24.840 --> 00:29.600]  this Friday August 28th I am Jason Burma sitting in for Alex Jones Alex coming up
[00:29.600 --> 00:35.280]  in the second third and fourth hours with Mark Siegel Cindy Sheehan Dr. Eisenstein
[00:35.280 --> 00:41.200]  and John Perkins but boy do I have a stacker of news to cover in this first
[00:41.200 --> 00:47.120]  hour bill would give president emergency control of the internet now we've
[00:47.120 --> 00:51.840]  covered the cyber security act here we've covered the cyber bullying act that
[00:51.840 --> 00:56.880]  was promoted by Miley Cyrus now this is the latest off of Cena and it's the lead
[00:56.880 --> 01:00.760]  story over at Drudge internet companies and civil liberty groups were alarmed
[01:00.760 --> 01:04.200]  this spring when a US Senate bill proposed handling handing the White
[01:04.200 --> 01:07.880]  House the power to disconnect private sector computers from the internet now
[01:07.880 --> 01:11.840]  this is probably the cyber security act that they're talking about it's weird
[01:11.840 --> 01:16.880]  because they don't really mention the bill in this I guess they don't want
[01:16.880 --> 01:19.720]  people they want people to know that it's happening they don't want people to
[01:19.720 --> 01:24.640]  look at the nightmarish legislation being from proposed by Senator Jay
[01:24.640 --> 01:28.800]  Rockefeller there's not much happier about the revised version that aids to
[01:28.800 --> 01:32.960]  Senator Jay Rockefeller a West Virginia Democrat have spent months drafting
[01:32.960 --> 01:37.200]  behind closed doors CNET news has obtained a copy of the 55 page draft
[01:37.200 --> 01:40.800]  and they have a little excerpt there which still appears to permit the
[01:40.800 --> 01:45.280]  president to seize temporary control temporary please of private sector
[01:45.280 --> 01:51.360]  networks during so-called cyber security emergencies now what is a cyber
[01:51.360 --> 01:56.040]  security emergency perhaps it's an image of the president that goes viral that
[01:56.040 --> 02:01.960]  depicts him in a manner that is not flattering and even MSNBC wrote up an
[02:01.960 --> 02:06.520]  article it just got up there hey flicker why so censorist the jokerized image of
[02:06.520 --> 02:10.400]  president Barack Obama sat unmolested on flicker for about two months before it
[02:10.400 --> 02:14.040]  was removed by the staff at a photo sharing website a couple thousand viewer
[02:14.040 --> 02:17.320]  a couple thousand users viewed the image
[02:17.320 --> 02:21.600]  Obama's Time Magazine cover superimposed with the iconic joker look from the
[02:21.600 --> 02:25.520]  dark night and many of them commented on it sometimes it got heated then the
[02:25.520 --> 02:28.960]  co-opted image was co-opted again the time cover replaced with a single word
[02:28.960 --> 02:33.200]  socialism and anti-Obama posters that started popping up in Los Angeles
[02:33.200 --> 02:37.440]  suddenly the original jokerized time cover was gone from flicker and so were
[02:37.440 --> 02:42.040]  the comments people noticed media noticed too but the media was jumping on it
[02:42.040 --> 02:46.600]  saying oh you're racist if you're doing this this is a good thing this article is
[02:46.600 --> 02:51.080]  a is a three-pager and it's basically saying what's going on here this digital
[02:51.080 --> 02:54.880]  and millennium copyright act claim that you're talking about didn't come from
[02:54.880 --> 02:58.800]  Time Magazine didn't come from the original artist so where are you
[02:58.800 --> 03:03.000]  getting this stuff from and why are you censoring this image it's obviously not
[03:03.000 --> 03:09.160]  pornography it's obviously in the bounds of free speech it's not racist look
[03:09.160 --> 03:16.480]  it's not racist to paint somebody up as a famous DC character and now I movie
[03:16.480 --> 03:20.600]  character I mean there wasn't a bigger film than the dark night last year
[03:20.600 --> 03:25.680]  okay so when you paint the president up as a villain you're basically making
[03:25.680 --> 03:30.280]  social commentary that he ain't a good guy that he's the bad guy and the jokes
[03:30.280 --> 03:34.680]  on us nothing to do with racism whatsoever zero to do with racism but
[03:34.680 --> 03:38.720]  they want to paint us up as a bunch of white supremacists who hate everybody
[03:38.720 --> 03:42.240]  and you know we want to take over the government by any means necessary we
[03:42.240 --> 03:46.800]  want to shoot people we want to blow up buildings they want to associate us with
[03:46.800 --> 03:51.440]  domestic extremism and terrorism they want to tell people we will work with
[03:51.440 --> 03:56.240]  al-qaeda to bring this country down in the words of glenn beck total scum in
[03:56.240 --> 04:00.880]  fact I was watching glenn beck yesterday I was in the break room we tape a lot of
[04:00.880 --> 04:05.120]  news here and I'm watching him and he's he's got Michelle malkin that little
[04:05.120 --> 04:08.520]  devil woman on and I don't remember who the other guy was but he was an
[04:08.520 --> 04:13.040]  advisor for the carter administration and they're all talking about oh how bad
[04:13.040 --> 04:17.880]  it is and how bad the democrats have gotten and acorn is bad and they're
[04:17.880 --> 04:21.400]  ringing of americorps but they don't want to tie it together that this is
[04:21.400 --> 04:25.520]  beyond left or right this isn't a socialist agenda coming out of the
[04:25.520 --> 04:30.680]  democratic party no this is a globalist agenda being pushed by our banker
[04:30.680 --> 04:35.680]  overlords and that's why they're openly stating oh the fdic might go under in
[04:35.680 --> 04:39.160]  fact that's another top headline here they're talking about 400 plus banks
[04:39.160 --> 04:41.760]  that are gonna go under with them we're gonna get to that in a moment it's the

[08:14.040 --> 08:18.960]  Jason Burma sitting in and let's not forget that president Barack Obama has
[08:18.960 --> 08:26.160]  already stated that he has built a cyber security office a new intelligence
[08:26.160 --> 08:30.880]  service okay another bureaucracy homeland security not enough you know the
[08:30.880 --> 08:35.280]  NSA wasn't enough before that the CIA the FBI all these other agencies not
[08:35.280 --> 08:39.960]  enough we need a cyber security czar and they brought this word back into the
[08:39.960 --> 08:44.200]  language as though it's commonplace and we should be accepting it folks we
[08:44.200 --> 08:49.520]  shouldn't be accepting the czar's we have elected officials for a reason we
[08:49.520 --> 08:55.320]  like things like oversight we like to stop corruption and bring people up on
[08:55.320 --> 09:00.920]  charges when they do something wrong czar is just like I'm omnipresent I have
[09:00.920 --> 09:04.800]  all the power I do what I want and that's why they have created the cyber
[09:04.800 --> 09:08.760]  security office and a cyber security czar I want to read a little bit more of
[09:08.760 --> 09:12.000]  this article here the new version would allow the president to declare a
[09:12.000 --> 09:17.000]  cyber security emergency relating to non governmental computer networks and do
[09:17.000 --> 09:20.800]  what's necessary to respond to a threat other sections of the proposal include a
[09:20.800 --> 09:24.680]  federal clarification or certification program for cyber security professionals
[09:24.680 --> 09:28.280]  and a requirement that certain computer systems and networks in the private
[09:28.280 --> 09:32.520]  sector be managed by people who have been awarded that license in other words
[09:32.520 --> 09:39.080]  we need government snoops on all privatized networks with hands-on experience
[09:39.080 --> 09:43.240]  we can't afford to have somebody miles and miles away trying to shut down a
[09:43.240 --> 09:48.000]  server we need somebody on site I think the redraft well-improved remains
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.120]  troubling due to its vagueness said Larry Clinton president of the Internet
[09:51.120 --> 09:55.080]  Security Alliance which counts representatives of Verizon, Verisign,
[09:55.080 --> 09:59.640]  Nordle and Carnegie Mellon University on its board it is unclear what authority
[09:59.640 --> 10:03.640]  Senator Senator Rockefeller thinks is necessary over the private sector unless
[10:03.640 --> 10:08.120]  this is clarified we cannot properly analyze let alone support the bill no
[10:08.120 --> 10:15.040]  you can properly analyze this bill it's garbage it's crap it's control that's
[10:15.040 --> 10:20.400]  what this bill is about it's about the elimination of free speech on the
[10:20.400 --> 10:26.600]  Internet entirely it will allow them to shut down info wars it will allow them
[10:26.600 --> 10:29.360]  to shut down any article that they don't see fit if they don't like what Larry
[10:29.360 --> 10:32.440]  Flint is saying over at the Huffington Post and it's getting too much traction
[10:32.440 --> 10:36.880]  Nixit okay they feel very very threatened you know I used the point
[10:36.880 --> 10:41.760]  yesterday of how Michael Moore had his trailer on from August 20th to the 26th
[10:41.760 --> 10:45.120]  and only received 30,000 views well I went to the Alexa ratings yesterday and
[10:45.120 --> 10:51.520]  Michael Moore.com is like 44 or 45,000 okay compare that to info wars.com
[10:51.520 --> 10:58.320]  we're below 4,000 we are 11 times more popular than the most popular documentary
[10:58.320 --> 11:03.000]  filmmaker in the world what does that say that says that they have to start
[11:03.000 --> 11:07.380]  regulating us before we go completely supernova and that's what these bills
[11:07.380 --> 11:13.160]  are about all right let's shift the gears let's get into this top 400 list
[11:13.160 --> 11:17.000]  this is a Wall Street Journal law article by the way banks on sick list top
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.940]  400 okay the banking industry continues to deteriorate while federal
[11:20.940 --> 11:26.360]  regulators are adding 111 lenders to their list of endangered banks in the
[11:26.360 --> 11:31.000]  latest quarter even the economy shows signs of stabilizing that's a total
[11:31.000 --> 11:38.280]  lie they constantly are saying oh the economy stabilizing growth is starting
[11:38.280 --> 11:41.600]  to occur no it's not folks in fact I've got another article here
[11:41.600 --> 11:47.200]  Whirlpool about to fire 11 or 1100 people and that's nothing Whirlpool
[11:47.200 --> 11:50.720]  just another company feeling the crunch they're out of here 1100 more jobs out
[11:50.720 --> 11:56.640]  here the post office is firing and buying out 30,000 of its employees
[11:56.640 --> 12:01.840]  meanwhile they are converting to a global currency for international
[12:01.840 --> 12:06.800]  shipping say it with me they are converting to a global currency the
[12:06.800 --> 12:13.960]  SDR unit special drawing rights unit this is the currency of the current
[12:13.960 --> 12:18.520]  incarnation of the new world order this is what they're promoting this is what
[12:18.520 --> 12:23.200]  they're pushing data released Thursday painted a gloomy gloomy picture of the
[12:23.200 --> 12:26.480]  state of banking the government fund that protects consumer deposits fell to
[12:26.480 --> 12:31.160]  its lowest level since 1993 the continuing lows which come despite
[12:31.160 --> 12:34.960]  trillions of dollars in government rescue financing and rebounding stock
[12:34.960 --> 12:39.360]  market race questions about how quickly the economy can revive well at least
[12:39.360 --> 12:42.040]  they're being honest about the trillions they're not going to tell you 24
[12:42.040 --> 12:47.160]  trillion dollars which we 20 I think was 23.7 two months ago in Bloomberg now
[12:47.160 --> 12:54.760]  almost two months ago they're reporting 23.7 trill dog 23.7 trill they've got it
[12:54.760 --> 12:59.280]  as for and also it's going to happen is all these smaller banks the ones that
[12:59.280 --> 13:02.880]  are actually semi honest are going to be put out of business as they consolidate
[13:02.880 --> 13:06.160]  power and they just take it to the house let me tell you something Merrill
[13:06.160 --> 13:09.640]  Lynch ain't going under Bank of America ain't going under Chase Manhattan ain't
[13:09.640 --> 13:14.360]  going under the CIO the CEOs are not facing hardships no they're out on a
[13:14.360 --> 13:18.400]  beach somewhere laughing it up patting each other on the on the back
[13:18.400 --> 13:25.480]  another martini you bet you bet I mean they are drinking alcoholic fruity
[13:25.480 --> 13:29.400]  beverages while laughing at you as their bank account just goes through the
[13:29.400 --> 13:35.720]  roof the federal deposit insurance corp said it has 416 banks on its problem
[13:35.720 --> 13:39.400]  list at the end of June equivalent to about 5% of the nation's bank up from
[13:39.400 --> 13:45.080]  305 at the end of March and 117 at the end of June 2008 problem banks had a
[13:45.080 --> 13:47.920]  combined two hundred ninety nine point eight billion of assets at the end of
[13:47.920 --> 13:51.400]  June compared to seventy eight point three billion a year ago landing on the
[13:51.400 --> 13:57.040]  FDIC's problem list means a bank is at a high risk of insolvency state and
[13:57.040 --> 14:01.880]  federal regulators have already shot eighty one banks this year and again we
[14:01.880 --> 14:05.800]  reported it this week one of the law the second largest bank to go under was
[14:05.800 --> 14:12.280]  right here in Texas and they're just out of here gone done so you're just going
[14:12.280 --> 14:15.240]  to continue to see this again and again and again and I don't know if they're
[14:15.240 --> 14:18.840]  going to declare a bank holiday I don't know what happens if the FDIC goes under
[14:18.840 --> 14:24.480]  but I do know that they are moving towards a global system of currency and
[14:24.480 --> 14:29.560]  this SDR unit which they've loaned out to Mexico now it's it's it's what they
[14:29.560 --> 14:33.120]  loan out they're not loaning out dollars the dollar is dead it's done it's over
[14:33.120 --> 14:39.320]  with get a grip be an adult admit it to yourself admit you need a plan your
[14:39.320 --> 14:43.400]  dollars or so when Max Kaiser it must have been like four or five months ago
[14:43.400 --> 14:48.760]  when he was using the toilet paper analogy he was spot on and how are we
[14:48.760 --> 14:52.360]  going to communicate with one another as this happens if they shut down the
[14:52.360 --> 14:56.320]  internet let's not forget either because a lot of people still think that you know
[14:56.320 --> 15:00.080]  they don't surveil everything we do on the internet look it came out and
[15:00.080 --> 15:04.680]  hepting versus AT&T over 40 officials blew the whistle Mark Klein being one of
[15:04.680 --> 15:08.520]  them that everything you do on your cell phone and on the internet is track
[15:08.520 --> 15:12.840]  traced and database by all the major companies including AT&T Verizon Sprint
[15:12.840 --> 15:16.280]  you name it Jason how does that work it's very easy everything goes through a
[15:16.280 --> 15:21.280]  line a physical line information goes over fiber optic cables okay so they
[15:21.280 --> 15:26.120]  just split the fiber optic cable they send it into the secret room in a room
[15:26.120 --> 15:30.800]  full of servers everything is copied verbatim it doesn't have any
[15:30.800 --> 15:34.440]  distinguishing what's allowed to be copied and what's not and then it runs
[15:34.440 --> 15:38.960]  through software like carnivore and promise those are those are all the
[15:38.960 --> 15:42.040]  classified pieces of software God knows what they're using today and they look
[15:42.040 --> 15:47.360]  for key words and key phrases and patterns and everything you do is being
[15:47.360 --> 15:51.400]  categorized and it's going to jump to another level as soon as Microsoft
[15:51.400 --> 15:57.720]  launches their project Natal where they literally put a face scanning voice
[15:57.720 --> 16:01.960]  recognition camera in your home you are the controller it's hooked up to the
[16:01.960 --> 16:06.120]  internet all the time unless you unplug your Ethernet system and most people
[16:06.120 --> 16:10.560]  won't be smart enough to do that and this thing can recognize up to four
[16:10.560 --> 16:15.440]  people at once okay it recognizes your voice pattern you can shop online with
[16:15.440 --> 16:19.320]  this thing it's like the Jetsons you go on Amazon.com it's looking at you as
[16:19.320 --> 16:23.240]  you're shopping through it your hand is the remote control you can model close
[16:23.240 --> 16:28.240]  with this thing this is the next level and we are being acclimated to it on
[16:28.240 --> 16:31.600]  another level we're being trained to think that's okay to have in your house
[16:31.600 --> 16:35.480]  meanwhile in the United Kingdom they're saying that the worst of the worst the
[16:35.480 --> 16:41.120]  worst parents are now going to have to be under 24 hour CCTV surveillance in
[16:41.120 --> 16:47.960]  their home in their home their very own residence and if you don't think that
[16:47.960 --> 16:51.600]  that's coming to the United States it is everything that happens in the UK
[16:51.600 --> 16:55.360]  eventually gets here and everything that happens here eventually gets the UK we
[16:55.360 --> 17:00.960]  are the model meanwhile we love China's slave state we can't get enough of the
[17:00.960 --> 17:04.760]  way that they treat their workers their one-child policies and we move closer
[17:04.760 --> 17:10.440]  to that as they start to wear our blue jeans and slurp down our Coca-Cola it is
[17:10.440 --> 17:17.120]  this motion towards a global society towards one world and that's what the
[17:17.120 --> 17:21.680]  elite continue to push all right I've harped on the banks I've harped on the
[17:21.680 --> 17:27.160]  economy I've harped on the cyber security it's time to get into swine flu now
[17:27.160 --> 17:30.480]  if you've been listening this week I've been ranting and raving how you can't
[17:30.480 --> 17:36.960]  get higher than level 6 well apparently the WHO is announcing in in Spain that
[17:36.960 --> 17:41.640]  they are higher than level 6 weird right I'm holding article out of the coast
[17:41.640 --> 17:46.240]  to news right now hospitals gear up for flu epidemic and right here this little
[17:46.240 --> 17:49.720]  excerpt as each medical facility puts its protocols into action the health
[17:49.720 --> 17:52.920]  authority continues to keep its 24-hour hotline and the World Health
[17:52.920 --> 17:59.640]  Organization has raised its pandemic alert level to 6.2 6.2 wait a minute
[17:59.640 --> 18:04.280]  you're not supposed to be above 6 this is about fear mongering this is about
[18:04.280 --> 18:09.160]  trying to get people even more overhyped about the situation oh my god 6.2
[18:09.160 --> 18:12.560]  it's like them raising the terror threat level right before the elections
[18:12.560 --> 18:16.520]  remember we were big conspiracy theorists when they started raising the
[18:16.520 --> 18:21.440]  terror threat level in 2004 and we said look there's no more of a threat for
[18:21.440 --> 18:25.200]  terrorism than there was yesterday or the week before or the month before this
[18:25.200 --> 18:29.600]  is all politics this is about fear mongering to the American public because
[18:29.600 --> 18:33.040]  it didn't really matter that John Kerry won the election that's right John Kerry
[18:33.040 --> 18:38.320]  won the 2004 election folks I mean count the ballots but then he bowed down the
[18:38.320 --> 18:42.920]  next day after they rigged it he didn't challenge it he didn't say hey I want to
[18:42.920 --> 18:47.360]  see my voice over in Ohio hey I want to see where they had diabolos systems he
[18:47.360 --> 18:51.160]  said you know what my skull and bones brothers gonna make a great president for
[18:51.160 --> 18:56.240]  the next four years I love him my second cousin on one side my eighth cousin on
[18:56.240 --> 19:03.880]  the other George W. Bush our savior and folks just like when they try to say
[19:03.880 --> 19:08.240]  we're at orange we're at red oh my god 6 was supposed to be the level that you
[19:08.240 --> 19:11.480]  couldn't go above well now they're saying that's just not enough we've got to
[19:11.480 --> 19:15.960]  get to 6.2 and I got to go to the WHO website and see how far they're gonna
[19:15.960 --> 19:20.800]  ratchet this up I mean will there be a 7 will they be an 8 shortly I mean after
[19:20.800 --> 19:23.840]  they start rounding people up and forcibly vaccinating them and they
[19:23.840 --> 19:27.640]  have quarantine centers are we gonna be higher than 6.2 and I've noticed there's
[19:27.640 --> 19:32.240]  no US media talking about this 6.2 event I hadn't seen it until today but
[19:32.240 --> 19:38.120]  apparently in Spain we're at 6.2 on the WHO level we're gonna talk about that and
[19:38.120 --> 19:43.200]  it's it's it's either a fake poll or they really brainwashed a lot of people
[19:43.200 --> 19:47.080]  two-thirds in US plan to get swine flu vaccine it's the Alex Jones show I am

[25:00.240 --> 25:04.560]  triple eight three four four six six eight one or go click the banner over at
[25:04.560 --> 25:11.920]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.tv all right so this latest poll two-thirds in
[25:11.920 --> 25:16.160]  the US planned to get swine flu vaccine instead of Reuters now I saw this and I
[25:16.160 --> 25:20.120]  thought to myself that can't be true okay two-thirds this has to be a rigged
[25:20.120 --> 25:24.920]  poll or their propaganda their propaganda has gotten so sophisticated
[25:24.920 --> 25:29.560]  and over the top they have convinced another 30 to 40 percent to take the
[25:29.560 --> 25:35.400]  shot only I don't know one month maybe six weeks ago they ran a poll it was in
[25:35.400 --> 25:41.400]  Reuters the headline was less than 30 percent planned to take the shot or
[25:41.400 --> 25:45.760]  around 30 percent but then you read deeper into the article and it was 18
[25:45.760 --> 25:50.000]  percent so it was less than 20 percent said 18 percent of people are gonna take
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.920]  this shot and it can't be more than a month old now they're saying two-thirds
[25:52.920 --> 25:58.400]  in the US plan to get the swine flu vaccine two-thirds well if two-thirds
[25:58.400 --> 26:01.520]  take it then they might be right then maybe 30 to 40 percent of the workforce
[26:01.520 --> 26:07.440]  won't be around because you're injecting them with a live virus okay you're
[26:07.440 --> 26:11.880]  injecting them with squailing with mercury with total hate and domination
[26:11.880 --> 26:16.120]  all right let's read it more than 90% of Americans plan to do something to
[26:16.120 --> 26:20.200]  protect themselves from the H1N1 pandemic flu virus and more than 60% will
[26:20.200 --> 26:23.520]  get vaccinated according to an American Red Cross survey released on
[26:23.520 --> 26:27.640]  Thursday only 11% say they were very worried about the new swine flu and
[26:27.640 --> 26:32.520]  another 29% are somewhat very worried the rest 60% said that they are not
[26:32.520 --> 26:38.080]  worried I just can't buy it folks I cannot buy that two-thirds of the people
[26:38.080 --> 26:41.760]  out there are getting ready to roll up their sleeves for this poison but I
[26:41.760 --> 26:44.960]  guess you know when you put out a massive propaganda campaign when you
[26:44.960 --> 26:51.160]  offer people $50 stipends to take the shot when you make churches and local
[26:51.160 --> 26:54.840]  schools the vaccination centers maybe they will get two-thirds of you idiots
[26:54.840 --> 26:58.840]  out there but if you if you're listening to this program right now and you have
[26:58.840 --> 27:03.040]  not warned your family you know you got a niece or a nephew out there I got a
[27:03.040 --> 27:07.080]  four-year-old little niece she's just starting up pre-k this week in fact I
[27:07.080 --> 27:12.320]  talked to her think two or three nights ago adorable I love her to death and her
[27:12.320 --> 27:16.080]  father my brother very well aware of this stuff and you know he's still got to
[27:16.080 --> 27:20.920]  have a talk with the mother of the child and say look we're not giving our baby
[27:20.920 --> 27:25.800]  this shot period amen it's not happening there's no swine flu shot for my four
[27:25.800 --> 27:29.320]  year old niece now I've had that conversation the question is have you
[27:29.320 --> 27:34.320]  had that conversation with your sister your brother your mother your father
[27:34.320 --> 27:39.120]  your friend you need to have that conversation with them and if you have
[27:39.120 --> 27:42.320]  to arm yourself with a little bit of knowledge if you have to spend some time
[27:42.320 --> 27:45.160]  at a computer and print off all these mainline articles if you have to go to
[27:45.160 --> 27:50.240]  prismplanet.com and find this stuff get the mainline source articles okay
[27:50.240 --> 27:55.360]  that's why what we do here is so damn important everything we report is
[27:55.360 --> 28:00.200]  reported by the mainstream sure it's on you know the 17th page of the newspaper
[28:00.200 --> 28:04.880]  or it's hidden three-quarters of the way through the article but if you can
[28:04.880 --> 28:08.360]  read and your brain still works on some level you haven't succumbed to the
[28:08.360 --> 28:13.480]  mercury poisoning and the fluoride in the water maybe you have a shot to stop
[28:13.480 --> 28:19.360]  this thing maybe you have a shot to protect those that you love okay so I
[28:19.360 --> 28:24.480]  just couldn't believe it apparently we're at 6.2 apparently two-thirds of the
[28:24.480 --> 28:28.120]  people are going to take this vaccine I don't buy it I think there's more of a
[28:28.120 --> 28:33.160]  resistance out there this you know we we should remind people that in the
[28:33.160 --> 28:37.800]  beginning of August the head of Merck vaccine unit retires early as Dean as
[28:37.800 --> 28:40.880]  deal looms this guy didn't want anything to do with this whole swine flu
[28:40.880 --> 28:46.240]  vaccination a tarp Merck and CCO executive once viewed as a candidate to
[28:46.240 --> 28:49.560]  become chief executive the drugmaker has retired possibly signaling a
[28:49.560 --> 28:54.600]  management shake-up ahead of Merck's planned purchase of a share plow corp
[28:54.600 --> 28:58.320]  Margaret Milligan announced internally last week that she would retire as
[28:58.320 --> 29:02.040]  president of Merck's vaccine and infectious disease unit my guess is
[29:02.040 --> 29:06.960]  this woman has a conscience and she cannot go along to get along a lot of
[29:06.960 --> 29:10.760]  people do go along to get along Ted Kennedy was one of those guys that went
[29:10.760 --> 29:14.520]  along to get along I mean he didn't blow the whistle on his brother's
[29:14.520 --> 29:17.200]  murderers and this one's out of the Guardian we'll cover it on the other
[29:17.200 --> 29:22.040]  side of the break how Nixon gave Ted Kennedy bodyguards to spy on his
[29:22.040 --> 29:25.880]  personal life and here's one of the quotes from our you know good friend
[29:25.880 --> 29:29.880]  over at the bohemian club Richard Nixon I mean he called those guys out but he
[29:29.880 --> 29:34.400]  still went folks too damn bad if he gets shot that was the attitude of the
[29:34.400 --> 29:39.880]  president who wanted agents to dig into potential rivals super-swinger lifestyle
[29:39.880 --> 29:42.640]  there it is right there we'll get to it on the other side it's the Alex Jones
[29:42.640 --> 29:47.440]  show I'm Jason Burma's prison planet dot TV info wars dot com
[29:50.160 --> 29:59.680]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:59.680 --> 30:04.120]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[30:04.120 --> 30:07.800]  solar power generator this summer number one new climate legislation could
[30:07.800 --> 30:11.640]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[30:11.640 --> 30:15.760]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[30:15.760 --> 30:19.480]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[30:19.480 --> 30:23.680]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[30:23.680 --> 30:27.120]  is dangerously overloaded especially with the high-demand summer months ahead
[30:27.120 --> 30:31.080]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again every
[30:31.080 --> 30:34.760]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages number
[30:34.760 --> 30:38.760]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[30:38.760 --> 30:42.640]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[30:42.640 --> 30:46.800]  from science a long-time sponsor of ours you can get more information at

[31:10.440 --> 31:16.880]  just as powerful just as strong just as well funded the Obama deception completely
[31:16.880 --> 31:20.720]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American
[31:20.720 --> 31:26.000]  people while Obama's already fudging yeah but since day one in this election if
[31:26.000 --> 31:30.320]  you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who
[31:30.320 --> 31:35.680]  is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[31:35.680 --> 31:40.560]  that's fascism it's not about left or right it's about a one-world government

[32:03.520 --> 32:08.320]  that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid even
[32:08.320 --> 32:12.240]  as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to
[32:12.240 --> 32:16.000]  the limits of our nation's power grid some say that this summer's demand for
[32:16.000 --> 32:20.440]  electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge creating a cascade
[32:20.440 --> 32:24.760]  of power outages across the country putting us all in the dark are you
[32:24.760 --> 32:28.400]  prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government
[32:28.400 --> 32:32.560]  created blackouts have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid
[32:32.560 --> 32:37.400]  and generate your own private supply of electrical power if so this will be the
[32:37.400 --> 32:41.640]  most important information you have ever heard solar powered generators are
[32:41.640 --> 32:45.880]  finally available they have no moving parts to wear out or break and require
[32:45.880 --> 32:51.440]  absolutely no gas whatsoever remember the government doesn't own the sun so go

[33:20.240 --> 33:23.560]  Chapman in just a moment but I want to finish up on this Nixon story just the
[33:23.560 --> 33:26.800]  headline right here how Nixon gave ten to give any bodyguards to spy on his
[33:26.800 --> 33:30.420]  personal life so you know Ted Kennedy never stepped up to the plate never said
[33:30.420 --> 33:32.960]  my brothers were murdered we need to get to the bottom this just kind of rode
[33:32.960 --> 33:36.400]  out a Senate career tried to run for president at one point Nixon considered
[33:36.400 --> 33:39.280]  Ted Kennedy such a threat that he tried to catch him cheating on his wife even
[33:39.280 --> 33:42.760]  ordering aids to plan Secret Service bodyguards to spy on the senator's
[33:42.760 --> 33:46.240]  behavior and when he pulled Secret Service protocol he said I don't give a
[33:46.240 --> 33:53.200]  damn if he gets shot Mr. Chapman how are you this morning well fine thank you
[33:53.200 --> 33:59.320]  no I want to talk to you I am good I want to get into this FDIC talking about
[33:59.320 --> 34:05.040]  their own bailout just putting up a list of the top 400 banks that are toxic
[34:05.040 --> 34:08.640]  that they seem to they seem these banks aren't gonna be around much longer I
[34:08.640 --> 34:15.160]  mean what is your take on this well my take has been for about two years ago I
[34:15.160 --> 34:21.520]  projected that out of 8400 banks that approximately 40 to 50 percent would go
[34:21.520 --> 34:27.520]  wonder so that would be from about thirty two hundred thirty three hundred all
[34:27.520 --> 34:33.480]  the way up to over four thousand and now they're talking about 80 banks or 70
[34:33.480 --> 34:38.560]  whatever it is and you know what they've been doing on the side is it is
[34:38.560 --> 34:45.000]  absorbing smaller banks particularly little ones into the big banking system
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.520]  and they're not telling anybody about it so you know the XYZ bank in little
[34:49.520 --> 34:56.280]  town America I had a sign change last week to ABC Bank of New York or something
[34:56.280 --> 35:02.440]  and people say well you know as long as my money safe I don't care one of the
[35:02.440 --> 35:10.600]  things that is to go along with that is that they the FDIC don't have any it
[35:10.600 --> 35:16.600]  doesn't have any money interesting the way they get their money they get it
[35:16.600 --> 35:24.680]  from the banks the banks paid into the general fund and then as the FDIC uses
[35:24.680 --> 35:30.920]  it they they request funds from the general fund which are meted out to them
[35:30.920 --> 35:38.440]  Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security do the same thing but anyway they
[35:38.440 --> 35:44.960]  probably got about ten billion but they have committed themselves on unsecured
[35:44.960 --> 35:53.680]  unsecured loans of 368 billion dollars and when Sheila there was asked about it
[35:53.680 --> 35:59.000]  she kind of forgot to answer there was there was I saw her on I don't know with
[35:59.000 --> 36:07.400]  ABC it's in the next issue incidentally tomorrow it's a link and she didn't
[36:07.400 --> 36:12.680]  answer that but she kind of frowned when the question was asked but she's
[36:12.680 --> 36:17.720]  pretty honest and she doesn't seem to to be too political and she's very bright
[36:17.720 --> 36:28.880]  and the bottom line is this about three months ago she informally asked the
[36:28.880 --> 36:37.640]  Treasury Department to talk to Congress about getting her $500 billion now to put
[36:37.640 --> 36:44.060]  that into perspective 70 to 75 percent of all the deposits are held by four
[36:44.060 --> 36:53.120]  banks most people don't know that secondly the same banks that hold these
[36:53.120 --> 37:02.480]  deposits are essentially bankrupt now to cover one percent of all of the money
[37:02.480 --> 37:09.520]  under $250,000 in the accounts at all the banks they would need $700 billion
[37:09.520 --> 37:16.440]  so as you can see there's virtually no coverage for FDIC they don't have the
[37:16.440 --> 37:22.120]  money and even if they got 700 billion they would only have enough money to
[37:22.120 --> 37:31.880]  cover the 1% of people who have deposits besides bailing the banks out so
[37:31.880 --> 37:36.160]  what happens here I mean you you just talked about how the four banks have
[37:36.160 --> 37:40.920]  75% of this debt now these are the big banks these banks aren't going to go
[37:40.920 --> 37:44.840]  under most people don't realize that they're going to swallow up these small
[37:44.840 --> 37:48.800]  banks but what happens I mean this is obviously a consolidation of power we're
[37:48.800 --> 37:52.640]  obviously seeing the big banks gaining more and more power as the small banks
[37:52.640 --> 37:59.880]  go under but what happens if the FDIC fails nobody gets anything it's just
[37:59.880 --> 38:04.720]  done it's beyond the bank holiday is what you're telling me that's correct
[38:04.720 --> 38:08.480]  okay I don't think it's imminent now but it'll happen sometime in the next few
[38:08.480 --> 38:13.760]  years and in when probably two to two and a half years from now when inflation
[38:13.760 --> 38:18.840]  hyperinflation craps out and deflation takes over and the insiders decide
[38:18.840 --> 38:23.640]  that now's the time to pull a plug on everybody and that's why I was just
[38:23.640 --> 38:28.120]  gonna say it's so important you don't have more than three months operating
[38:28.120 --> 38:33.160]  expenses in the bank you get five grand at home in your safe and small bills you
[38:33.160 --> 38:37.520]  get rid of all of your investments in the stock market except gold and silver
[38:37.520 --> 38:42.040]  shares you get out of your bonds you get out of your cash values and insurance
[38:42.040 --> 38:46.120]  policies and annuities and you put the money into gold and silver related
[38:46.120 --> 38:50.800]  assets why do you think that they're announcing this though I mean obviously
[38:50.800 --> 38:54.320]  that's the way to protect yourself is to get gold and silver and Midas
[38:54.320 --> 38:58.640]  resources is a great way to do this but why are they trying to soften the public
[38:58.640 --> 39:04.160]  up right now to warm them up to the idea that the FDIC is over or what is this
[39:04.160 --> 39:09.520]  why are they admitting that essentially the FDIC has no money as of today well
[39:09.520 --> 39:14.960]  they're admitting it because they have to admit it under the law and it's the
[39:14.960 --> 39:21.520]  same thing with the Fed reserve I saw Bonnie Frank at a town hall type of
[39:21.520 --> 39:26.360]  meeting I think it was in Taunton, Massachusetts and it's part of his
[39:26.360 --> 39:33.880]  constituency and Frank might be a lot of things but he's not stupid and he said
[39:33.880 --> 39:39.120]  at the very end of the conversation because somebody asked about 1207 the
[39:39.120 --> 39:45.440]  bill to investigate and audit the Fed reserve he said it will be passed next
[39:45.440 --> 39:49.800]  month really he actually admitted that this bill is going to go through the
[39:49.800 --> 39:53.000]  Senate that's interesting because I don't know if you saw the clip of Geithner
[39:53.000 --> 39:57.440]  being asked about 1207 and auditing the Fed but he just parrots the same exact
[39:57.440 --> 40:01.600]  talking points that Bernanke parrots that this can't be political and that the
[40:01.600 --> 40:06.720]  Fed is already transparent and it has oversight by Congress but then if there
[40:06.720 --> 40:11.600]  is so much oversight by Congress how did this bill 1207 push through Congress so
[40:11.600 --> 40:21.480]  quickly because the I think that's the I can't forget who does the oversight but
[40:21.480 --> 40:24.840]  I saw the woman who doesn't she didn't know anything about anything
[40:24.840 --> 40:32.800]  she was interrogated in the in the house and it was really pathetic I mean so
[40:32.800 --> 40:37.680]  basically they relegate that to just one or two constituents it's not truly the
[40:37.680 --> 40:41.580]  Congress that has oversight it's one person that they've appointed in the
[40:41.580 --> 40:47.360]  Congress who supposedly has oversight yeah but I think it's a the control of
[40:47.360 --> 40:51.600]  General's office or something like that but anyway the point is that I think
[40:51.600 --> 40:57.920]  they're gonna try to change the bill so it's not as onerous and we'll see but
[40:57.920 --> 41:02.960]  we're gonna get action and it could be a major turning point for us and the
[41:02.960 --> 41:10.040]  exposure of what people are doing and within the Fed and the connections that
[41:10.040 --> 41:17.320]  we'll get to it all and this is the most important thing that the Fed that
[41:17.320 --> 41:23.000]  the the elitists have and it's the the Federal Reserve and in any way that we
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.040]  can block it from doing what they're doing and take power away from them it
[41:27.040 --> 41:31.160]  gives us a better chance although we're coming the problems we've got we got a
[41:31.160 --> 41:37.040]  we're gonna stop them from telling the banks lend as much money as you want not
[41:37.040 --> 41:42.360]  eight to ten times fifty times and they did and that's why we got the problem
[41:42.360 --> 41:45.600]  and the other ones are supposed to be solving when they problem are the one
[41:45.600 --> 41:49.360]  they when they cause it in the first place and we get to pay for it twenty
[41:49.360 --> 41:53.760]  three point seven trillion dollars and that was last month's number do you for
[41:53.760 --> 41:58.680]  see some kind of a similar bailout for the FDIC somewhere where they announced
[41:58.680 --> 42:02.960]  that we are going to loan the FDIC you know seven hundred billion or a trillion
[42:02.960 --> 42:06.760]  dollars and then that money will again multiply beyond what we can even
[42:06.760 --> 42:11.160]  comprehend is that what's gonna happen with this absolutely without a doubt
[42:11.160 --> 42:13.960]  well what do you think that they're going to announce are they going to say
[42:13.960 --> 42:17.240]  well we're gonna give them such-and-such money and then just allow them to print
[42:17.240 --> 42:20.560]  carte blanche as much cash as possible where do you see this going I mean is
[42:20.560 --> 42:25.040]  this going to be in the house is an emergency we can ask you it has to go
[42:25.040 --> 42:30.600]  to Congress and Congress will okay it is just like if they want to have a
[42:30.600 --> 42:37.320]  second program for stimulus and they want a trillion or two trillion or
[42:37.320 --> 42:42.680]  whatever they want Congress will pass it it's unbelievable to me it's better
[42:42.680 --> 42:47.600]  than having a depression they just don't want to have to face the music like
[42:47.600 --> 42:52.800]  everybody behind the scenes all the bureaucrats from the revolving door out
[42:52.800 --> 43:01.640]  of Wall Street to the to Washington do you imagine that they're going to you
[43:01.640 --> 43:04.600]  know pull something similar to the way that they did last year where they
[43:04.600 --> 43:08.600]  just say look it's over and then all of a sudden you know if you don't pass this
[43:08.600 --> 43:11.400]  guy's martial law is gonna happen in the United States are they gonna be
[43:11.400 --> 43:15.440]  threatening congressmen again I mean are we at that level I don't think they'll
[43:15.440 --> 43:19.440]  have to I think they'll pass it anyway and if they don't or if they're not
[43:19.440 --> 43:24.040]  going to then they will take out the sharp knives and say look everybody on
[43:24.040 --> 43:28.280]  your in your constituency is going to be unemployed unemployed because the real
[43:28.280 --> 43:33.840]  unemployment whisper whisper behind the scenes is 20.8% right now let's say it
[43:33.840 --> 43:38.960]  was right now and your constituency is going to be around 32 to 35 percent in
[43:38.960 --> 43:43.600]  about six months how do you want to pass this thing and don't show let's talk
[43:43.600 --> 43:47.280]  about that what what is the unemployment rate because we're seeing in
[43:47.280 --> 43:51.000]  mainstream reports it's somewhere around 10 or 11 percent but that has got to be
[43:51.000 --> 43:57.920]  only 9.4 9.4 this is the way it works they they predict produce the the short
[43:57.920 --> 44:04.480]  term unemployment 9.4 percent the long long term from 1990 is you three and I
[44:04.480 --> 44:11.480]  won't even go into that but you six they quote occasionally and it's an official
[44:11.480 --> 44:18.280]  government figure it's 16.8% unemployment including short term unemployment people
[44:18.280 --> 44:23.360]  no longer getting checks for the state people who are discouraged and people
[44:23.360 --> 44:27.000]  who are working part-time and a lot of people working part-time because the
[44:27.000 --> 44:34.800]  average work rate is 33.1% you put them all into use six plus the birth-death
[44:34.800 --> 44:42.120]  ratio now if you extract the birth-death ratio which is the government says we
[44:42.120 --> 44:45.480]  can't get to all the small and medium-sized companies so we're gonna
[44:45.480 --> 44:49.280]  guess at it well every time they guess with the exception of a couple of times
[44:49.280 --> 44:55.120]  in the last five years they are six years they have found an average of a
[44:55.120 --> 44:58.640]  hundred and eighty five thousand new jobs per month which they made out of
[44:58.640 --> 45:04.360]  thin air which is nothing but a lie so if you extract that from the 16.8 you
[45:04.360 --> 45:09.880]  get 20.8% unbelievable I'm not the only one that does these figures John
[45:09.880 --> 45:14.280]  Williams does them as well and John's better at than I am and John came out
[45:14.280 --> 45:20.720]  with 20.9 so we'll do we'll use John figures well it seems like they're so
[45:20.720 --> 45:23.040]  similar why don't you tell people how they can get your information Mr.
[45:23.040 --> 45:28.120]  Chapman well they can go to the international forecaster.com that's
[45:28.120 --> 45:39.720]  the international f-o-r-e-c-a-s-t-e-r.com or they can call toll-free 877-479-8178
[45:39.720 --> 45:47.320]  that's 877-479-8178 you get a free introductory copy and you can
[45:47.320 --> 45:52.400]  have either one by email or by hard company through the postal service I
[45:52.400 --> 45:56.240]  kind of want to jump subject matter right now I have this article that I
[45:56.240 --> 46:01.480]  haven't been able to cover university tackles a new world order okay and in
[46:01.480 --> 46:04.640]  the first paragraph it says a new world political and social order an
[46:04.640 --> 46:09.600]  environmentally sustainable planet world peace and a new internet system to
[46:09.600 --> 46:13.840]  replace the one that's creaking under the weight of mass multimedia these are
[46:13.840 --> 46:19.240]  the core aims of the University of Essex's new research strategy now I
[46:19.240 --> 46:22.880]  just released my trailer for Invisible Empire a new world order defined this
[46:22.880 --> 46:27.720]  week and there are still people out there that don't believe a new world
[46:27.720 --> 46:32.600]  order either exists or is coming into being but yet there are mainline
[46:32.600 --> 46:37.680]  articles like this one and everything I just read off there is something we've
[46:37.680 --> 46:40.880]  been talking about here at info wars and something you've been talking about for
[46:40.880 --> 46:44.360]  decades I mean when you talk about a new world political and social order an
[46:44.360 --> 46:50.680]  environmentally sustainable their buzzword planet a world peace yeah okay
[46:50.680 --> 46:55.680]  and a new internet system to replace the one that's creaking under the weight of
[46:55.680 --> 46:59.320]  all this multimedia we've been telling you about internet too for years what
[46:59.320 --> 47:02.800]  does that tell you does that tell you that we are accelerating at a pace never
[47:02.800 --> 47:05.880]  before seen towards this this globalist new world order when they're just
[47:05.880 --> 47:09.800]  printing it in mainline articles having workshops at the University of Essex and
[47:09.800 --> 47:16.320]  other universities they're telling you that it's time for them to move because
[47:16.320 --> 47:20.880]  they want to set a public perception that this is absolutely necessary and we
[47:20.880 --> 47:26.480]  better go do this among other things and they want to create the image that
[47:26.480 --> 47:32.680]  with this internet is creaking I mean it's only what 20 years old let me think
[47:32.680 --> 47:38.480]  yeah about 20 years old and and it's not creaking under anything they just
[47:38.480 --> 47:42.720]  want to get control of it they want to form a new network so they can bypass
[47:42.720 --> 47:47.120]  this in a new work network they won't be any Alex Jones or Jason or Bob or
[47:47.120 --> 47:52.640]  anybody else I think that you're spot on with that and again the headline out of
[47:52.640 --> 47:56.480]  the a drudge report right now that goes to see net is about this cyber security
[47:56.480 --> 48:00.720]  act and the latest provisions on the bill they have a 55 page draft and of
[48:00.720 --> 48:04.920]  course not only the cyber security act but the cyber bullying act where if you
[48:04.920 --> 48:08.800]  you know you insult somebody you call somebody fat on the internet you might
[48:08.800 --> 48:12.440]  be you know you might be in trouble Bobby it might be a crime you might have to
[48:12.440 --> 48:15.480]  have your internet shut off and you might need to go to prison and then they're
[48:15.480 --> 48:20.480]  using this pop icon Miley Cyrus to promote this to the younger generation
[48:20.480 --> 48:25.040]  as if it's the norm and we don't need free speech in this country well they're
[48:25.040 --> 48:28.640]  doing the same thing in Canada as well I'm running a piece under Canada that
[48:28.640 --> 48:33.440]  came from the Globe and Mail and they're into this hate speech which is what
[48:33.440 --> 48:37.400]  you're talking about because if I called you fat Jason well that's hate speech
[48:37.400 --> 48:46.920]  and if you call me fat but to me Bob it's true but anyway no not quite but
[48:46.920 --> 48:52.640]  but the point is I just thought I make a joke but point is not only can they put
[48:52.640 --> 48:57.360]  you in jail but they can confiscate your assets and that's really the
[48:57.360 --> 49:05.160]  underlying notion of the article from the Globe and Mail and so if you got a
[49:05.160 --> 49:10.040]  chance you're getting my publication go into Canada and look for that link and
[49:10.040 --> 49:14.960]  take a look at it it's it's ominous and it's happening all over the world it's
[49:14.960 --> 49:18.640]  just not England the United States in Canada it's helping elsewhere as well
[49:18.640 --> 49:23.280]  and they're building the infrastructure right now in this country with Obama you
[49:23.280 --> 49:26.640]  know just come out and say we're gonna have a new cybersecurity office and we're
[49:26.640 --> 49:31.440]  gonna have a cybersecurity czar did you ever think that we would see the day in
[49:31.440 --> 49:37.760]  the United States where we had czars again no and it's something that is
[49:37.760 --> 49:45.920]  being used to bypass law bypass Congress and so that the executive hand
[49:45.920 --> 49:51.360]  branch will have its own little kingdom and we can heart back to Elizabeth the
[49:51.360 --> 49:57.880]  first Elizabeth the second we have now and the evolution of dictatorial
[49:57.880 --> 50:02.160]  government it is the evolution of dictatorial government and as you said
[50:02.160 --> 50:06.920]  the the national security apparatus that is building this infrastructure is just
[50:06.920 --> 50:12.960]  completely unbelievable they will invoke their executive powers and just say
[50:12.960 --> 50:18.840]  look we're beyond the law we're beyond checks and balances we decide what we
[50:18.840 --> 50:23.200]  want to do and you know that's why I make it a point to let people know
[50:23.200 --> 50:26.840]  everything you do on your cell phone and on the internet right now if you're
[50:26.840 --> 50:30.400]  with a major provider and everybody listening right now is with a major
[50:30.400 --> 50:35.560]  provider is tracked traced and database they have the secret room it went to
[50:35.560 --> 50:40.440]  court they threw it out of court from Bush's retroactive immunity then it

[54:20.960 --> 54:23.880]  Chabin we'll be going to him in a moment but first I want to thank one of our
[54:23.880 --> 54:28.040]  great sponsors eFoodsDirect.com that's one eight hundred four zero nine five
[54:28.040 --> 54:33.160]  six three three if you want the best storeable non-gmo foods in case of an
[54:33.160 --> 54:38.560]  emergency this is it eFoodsDirect one eight hundred four zero nine five six
[54:38.560 --> 54:42.960]  three three eFoodsDirect.com you know we were just talking about you know the
[54:42.960 --> 54:48.200]  cyber security the cyber securities are the new office but in reality just like
[54:48.200 --> 54:51.880]  I said Bob they're already track tracing and databaseing everything we're doing
[54:51.880 --> 54:56.880]  they've set up an infrastructure where you know homeland security local police
[54:56.880 --> 55:01.880]  forces all believe that you know extremists with Ron Paul bumper stickers
[55:01.880 --> 55:06.400]  and don't tread on me flags or the next terrorist I mean where is our society
[55:06.400 --> 55:14.720]  headed to a totalitarianism and it's already there it's not headed it is in
[55:14.720 --> 55:20.000]  it already and that's part of the game that we're watching here I mean
[55:20.000 --> 55:24.080]  essentially are we lying to ourselves if we think anything less I mean I just
[55:24.080 --> 55:28.880]  read an article yesterday you know all about the truth about lying and what a
[55:28.880 --> 55:33.600]  morally degradated culture we are and this is a news week how we tell lies you
[55:33.600 --> 55:37.080]  know three out of every ten things we say is just a complete and total lie and
[55:37.080 --> 55:40.960]  then we lie to ourselves about how serious situations are and we've been
[55:40.960 --> 55:45.080]  lying to ourselves about this economy for years and years and years now as they
[55:45.080 --> 55:49.160]  pull the rug from under us I mean are we going to wake up and you know become
[55:49.160 --> 55:54.040]  free citizens again are we just going to grovel under this new dictatorship
[55:54.040 --> 56:00.000]  well I think that we've made great headway with it with the American public
[56:00.000 --> 56:03.320]  particularly over the last couple of years because the programs like this
[56:03.320 --> 56:08.960]  and a handful of doodlers that get out there and get massive circulation like
[56:08.960 --> 56:14.000]  mine and the public's coming around you can see it in the town hall meetings and
[56:14.000 --> 56:20.600]  it it's encouraging how much more power we can get within that movement remains
[56:20.600 --> 56:26.680]  to be seen but hopefully it'll be very powerful it's coming along and what's
[56:26.680 --> 56:35.560]  going to make it viable is more people getting involved that's the key and so
[56:35.560 --> 56:41.880]  that's why we have to work harder and harder and harder to be able to stop the
[56:41.880 --> 56:46.560]  juggernaut which is the Federal Reserve and the revolving door from Wall
[56:46.560 --> 56:51.960]  Street to New York City and so on and so forth to Washington DC and so on and so
[56:51.960 --> 56:55.880]  forth and you remember you can't even go outside of the Federal Reserve and film
[56:55.880 --> 56:59.960]  without having security come up to you ask you a million questions want your
[56:59.960 --> 57:04.120]  identification the last time I was there and I was filming outside oh we just
[57:04.120 --> 57:08.560]  had that shooting up in DC a couple of weeks ago and I'm thinking to myself how
[57:08.560 --> 57:13.480]  are you comparing me and what I'm doing with a tripod and a camera on a sidewalk
[57:13.480 --> 57:18.280]  to a madman who walked into a Holocaust museum and started shooting people with
[57:18.280 --> 57:22.640]  a gun I mean did he have a camcorder it's complete ridiculousness and then
[57:22.640 --> 57:26.400]  they want every little piece of information and they threaten you I mean
[57:26.400 --> 57:31.040]  these banksters are truly in control they are truly above government and they
[57:31.040 --> 57:35.280]  don't want 1207 to pass like you said if 1207 does pass through the Senate they
[57:35.280 --> 57:39.840]  want that bill revised in such a manner it really cripples what it was intended
[57:39.840 --> 57:46.760]  to do well you're probably absolutely right and we have to see if we can stop
[57:46.760 --> 57:51.480]  that and you do that by going to all the members of the House and the Senate and
[57:51.480 --> 57:56.840]  you tell them the bill's coming up next month it's going to be voted on it will
[57:56.840 --> 58:01.560]  be passed but we want to pass in the language that it's been set up in not
[58:01.560 --> 58:07.400]  some character of a carcass of the original bill Bob Chapman of the
[58:07.400 --> 58:11.960]  international forecaster.com thank you so much for joining us thank you and I'll

[1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:11.600]  okay real fast Mark and Oregon you're on the air with Bob Chappell go ahead
[1:00:11.600 --> 1:00:22.640]  go ahead hi Alex and Bob how y'all doing today Alex a massive poster campaign on
[1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:27.880]  the vaccination deception is certainly an order no doubt not just in the United
[1:00:27.880 --> 1:00:31.960]  States but throughout the world now additionally forming groups of organized
[1:00:31.960 --> 1:00:37.160]  and public protest and public exposure that will force the mass media of this
[1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:41.920]  country in the world to report on the deadly ingredients of the upcoming global
[1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:46.760]  vaccinations I think would also be powerful as well as an expedited
[1:00:46.760 --> 1:00:51.440]  production and release of a video by yourself perhaps titled the vaccination
[1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:54.640]  deception all right let me be clear let me be clear that's a great idea the
[1:00:54.640 --> 1:00:58.840]  vaccination deception I've interviewed ten penny and others there is a section
[1:00:58.840 --> 1:01:04.400]  in the new film about the vaccine it's just it's coming out right in October and
[1:01:04.400 --> 1:01:08.400]  they may back off by then so I need to make it just about how they use overall
[1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:12.240]  vaccine systems but going back to Bob Chapman Bob isn't just the idea of lots
[1:01:12.240 --> 1:01:17.640]  of posters lets people get the idea that other people are upset it's harder to go
[1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:24.240]  form groups out of this you can form groups that's correct and also you have
[1:01:24.240 --> 1:01:29.880]  existing groups that you would introduce these you know poster to and said look if
[1:01:29.880 --> 1:01:33.520]  you're gonna do this you gotta do that too because they're gonna disagree with
[1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:39.640]  the vaccination process so you would get a hold of those groups and introduce
[1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:44.320]  them to posters and say put them up everywhere and I've done that before
[1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:49.640]  of course I'm a little low for it now but during political campaigns well you
[1:01:49.640 --> 1:01:54.600]  know we go out and and from 10 o'clock at night to 6 o'clock in the morning and
[1:01:54.600 --> 1:01:59.800]  put posters everywhere yeah there's nothing more America nothing more pro
[1:01:59.800 --> 1:02:03.920]  liberty and the fact the government's trying to demonize is outrageous San
[1:02:03.920 --> 1:02:08.920]  Francisco one first place the guys that did lower Manhattan you one second
[1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:13.080]  place and I'm watching all these other videos I think I know who third place is
[1:02:13.080 --> 1:02:16.720]  I'll announce it on Monday or during the weekend they'll be posted up on the site
[1:02:16.720 --> 1:02:21.360]  we're launching a new contest it'll be up by tonight or tomorrow to expose the
[1:02:21.360 --> 1:02:25.960]  flu okay to expose the shots I've just got to get all that written up and done
[1:02:25.960 --> 1:02:31.440]  as well speaking of the posters let's go to Jeff and South Dakota Jeff quickly
[1:02:31.440 --> 1:02:37.600]  what happened to you yeah yes Alex and Bob I was in a broken bone Nebraska which
[1:02:37.600 --> 1:02:41.400]  is where my wife is also a nurse I went down to the local gun show I was gonna
[1:02:41.400 --> 1:02:47.040]  take a picture of this huge Obama poster that the local IT slash you know on one
[1:02:47.040 --> 1:02:51.960]  store guy had up there at the gun show the thing must have been 8 by 10 in the
[1:02:51.960 --> 1:02:56.160]  meantime I'm putting up my own posters and stuff outside of the Obama Joker
[1:02:56.160 --> 1:03:00.600]  poster and stuff and as soon as I went back into do stuff I noticed my posters
[1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:03.920]  and stuff to get ripped down I know a couple gentlemen outside one look like
[1:03:03.920 --> 1:03:07.040]  a farmer another one look just like a cowboy and it turned out to be the
[1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:11.640]  promoters they in the meantime went inside me Jim take down his big poster
[1:03:11.640 --> 1:03:14.320]  which I wanted to get for you Alex this would have been huge I mean they're a
[1:03:14.320 --> 1:03:18.520]  nice poster for you I came back at them what was up why are you taking the stuff
[1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:22.960]  down they said well we're afraid to be political because the mayor of the town
[1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:26.440]  here in broken bone Nebraska might kick us out of the municipal building I
[1:03:26.440 --> 1:03:31.400]  think that's how this tyranny works first they tell churches they can't now
[1:03:31.400 --> 1:03:34.560]  they're ten and everybody's just in fact that's what the local paper in Austin
[1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:40.040]  in Hays County says we can't allow any of this it's on American and soon that's
[1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:44.440]  the point no one has any free speech Bob Chapman this is exactly what we're
[1:03:44.440 --> 1:03:50.240]  talking about absolutely absolutely and you'd what you do is you tell a man to
[1:03:50.240 --> 1:03:55.680]  take a hike so you know what I was saying what really made a man I said
[1:03:55.680 --> 1:03:59.200]  well okay I said then were your ancestors must have been porries or
[1:03:59.200 --> 1:04:02.280]  something I said you know maybe they were fighting on the wrong side of the
[1:04:02.280 --> 1:04:06.280]  revolution and they started getting my face obviously my hands are full of
[1:04:06.280 --> 1:04:11.000]  stuff it just literally pushed and shoved me out the door you know these
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:13.960]  are supposed to be supposed to be right wing conservative people I said well

[1:04:28.240 --> 1:04:33.120]  they might as well live in Romania in 1965 they might as well live in in
[1:04:33.120 --> 1:04:38.320]  Ukraine in 1935 I mean these people want to be raped they want to be enslaved

[1:07:54.920 --> 1:08:03.160]  coming
[1:08:03.160 --> 1:08:07.360]  he's done some research and when you start rationing health care and it looks
[1:08:07.360 --> 1:08:10.640]  as if that couldn't happen I mean if you got 50 million more people in the
[1:08:10.640 --> 1:08:13.920]  system and a certain number of doctors people are gonna be in line you're gonna
[1:08:13.920 --> 1:08:19.000]  have to determine who gets the next treatment is unfairly the elderly are
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:22.200]  the ones who are gonna get shortchanged that's so true I mean in a way it's a
[1:08:22.200 --> 1:08:30.360]  form of eugenics and that's why we've got him on with us I continually hear him
[1:08:30.360 --> 1:08:33.880]  point out how they want to put troops on the streets have the inoculations
[1:08:33.880 --> 1:08:37.880]  martial law now Ron Paul is talking about it former congressman Dick army
[1:08:37.880 --> 1:08:42.760]  saying they may use as a pretext to get their health care ram through this flu
[1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:47.680]  hype that they've got going so joining us for one segment and then we've got
[1:08:47.680 --> 1:08:52.240]  congressman Ron Paul coming up is of course Dr. Mark Siegel Fox News
[1:08:52.240 --> 1:08:57.240]  contributor and I certainly agree with a lot of the information he covers and
[1:08:57.240 --> 1:09:00.440]  also matches with some of the other medical doctors and virologists and
[1:09:00.440 --> 1:09:04.680]  epidemiologists that we have on sir thanks for coming on with us good to see
[1:09:04.680 --> 1:09:10.160]  you how you doing nice to be on good good give us your take on Obamacare I
[1:09:10.160 --> 1:09:14.480]  mean I've gone over the sections all that bad stuff is in there or at points
[1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:18.720]  at boards that we know do carry out all this rationing we know what happens in
[1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:22.000]  Canada and England and Germany that's on record you can watch the House of
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:26.960]  Commons on c-span and see him admitting it I mean as a doctor give us your
[1:09:26.960 --> 1:09:31.000]  snapshot of this program where you see it going and why you're saying it
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:35.760]  borders on eugenics well I think that I think the big issue here is that it
[1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:39.320]  starts in the wrong place I'm getting more and more disturbed about it now
[1:09:39.320 --> 1:09:42.880]  that now that we're seeing you know these religious references and everyone
[1:09:42.880 --> 1:09:46.920]  that doesn't agree with President Obama is somehow bearing false witness I mean
[1:09:46.920 --> 1:09:52.880]  how awful is that I mean you know I think I think that the whole discussion is
[1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:57.120]  misguided first of all anybody understands in the United States that
[1:09:57.120 --> 1:10:00.440]  that that if we're going to change something we need a debate so it's
[1:10:00.440 --> 1:10:04.560]  very suspicious that if you disagree with the president and the
[1:10:04.560 --> 1:10:08.480]  administration somehow you're wrong I mean where's the debate that there's got
[1:10:08.480 --> 1:10:12.160]  to be something to discuss and what about practicing physicians who are in the
[1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:16.120]  trenches every day with patients and see where this is going you know I'm not an
[1:10:16.120 --> 1:10:20.320]  insurance salesman I work with patients I have to deal with insurance public and
[1:10:20.320 --> 1:10:23.760]  private so why isn't the administration more interested in the fact that
[1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:27.560]  practicing physicians are having a problem with this we don't think the
[1:10:27.560 --> 1:10:31.920]  government insurance works that well we don't think that Medicaid works well at
[1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:35.480]  all we don't think Medicare is working very well well they're admitting doctor
[1:10:35.480 --> 1:10:40.160]  they can't even read the 1,300 page bill Conyers admits that I mean how can
[1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:44.560]  they implement something if they can't even read what was written by special
[1:10:44.560 --> 1:10:48.920]  interest a and then be going back and backing you up we have them all over the
[1:10:48.920 --> 1:10:53.360]  news now as a mantra saying you can't even call it socialism or you're a
[1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:59.240]  racist using the n-word they are weaponizing politics terrorizing the
[1:10:59.240 --> 1:11:03.680]  public and invoking racism they're actually the ones using race they're
[1:11:03.680 --> 1:11:10.920]  the ones that are engaging in racism race pimping really I think I think that
[1:11:10.920 --> 1:11:14.480]  we have to get back to basics here you know what are the basics the basics are
[1:11:14.480 --> 1:11:19.120]  whether they like it or not health care and health insurance are not the same
[1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:22.440]  thing I mean why Americans understand that that's one of the reasons we're
[1:11:22.440 --> 1:11:25.960]  having the problem we're having Americans understand that they own an
[1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:30.120]  automobile and they know if they bring their automobile in with a scratch their
[1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:33.680]  rates are going to go up and if they if they try to bring their automobile in
[1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:36.440]  with a scratch too much they're going to find out there are no repair shops
[1:11:36.440 --> 1:11:40.520]  around taking their insurance that's something we've lost sight of with
[1:11:40.520 --> 1:11:43.960]  health with health insurance health insurance is the problem it's not the
[1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:47.920]  solution and government run health insurance is absolutely the worst so
[1:11:47.920 --> 1:11:52.440]  it's completely disingenuous to have this discussion without looking at what
[1:11:52.440 --> 1:11:57.040]  real health needs health care needs are and one thing is and this is where I get
[1:11:57.040 --> 1:12:00.680]  very upset there's a great shortage of physicians in the United States there's
[1:12:00.680 --> 1:12:07.000]  an estimated 40,000 primary care physicians we're going to be lacking in
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:10.600]  the next 10 years and you can probably triple that given the fact that we have
[1:12:10.600 --> 1:12:15.080]  78 million baby boomers coming in then let's piss off physicians more let's
[1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:19.000]  cut them out don't worry we're not cutting benefits to patients we're only
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:23.280]  cutting benefits to the poor guy in a Medicaid clinic who's already doing
[1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:27.560]  cataract surgery for free and saw his reimbursements cut down from 17 under the
[1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:31.560]  500 and you know and has to file the paperwork with Medicaid before you get
[1:12:31.560 --> 1:12:34.640]  a patient and he can't even afford and he can't even I mean my dad's a physician
[1:12:34.640 --> 1:12:39.400]  he can't even then afford the medical malpractice insurance people aren't
[1:12:39.400 --> 1:12:43.280]  living in the real world that don't live and work as a physician like you do and
[1:12:43.280 --> 1:12:47.040]  I think you point out the whole debates of fraud back before we have medical
[1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:50.720]  insurance we even had you know better access to health care it becomes just
[1:12:50.720 --> 1:12:56.160]  this bigger and bigger fraud this bigger and bigger scam where the expenses of
[1:12:56.160 --> 1:12:59.840]  the bureaucracies go up and the media saying it's the doctors getting the
[1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:04.200]  money I see the statistics doctors in the last 20 years in many cases are
[1:13:04.200 --> 1:13:07.600]  making half of what they were people ask me all the time why aren't doctors
[1:13:07.600 --> 1:13:10.440]  fighting I'll give you a couple answers to that the number one you're not going
[1:13:10.440 --> 1:13:13.880]  to believe which is they're too busy taking care of patients number two is
[1:13:13.880 --> 1:13:18.240]  they most doctors realize that they're being steamrolled and they don't feel
[1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:22.160]  that there's anything to do about it so why waste the time but there's going to
[1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:26.160]  be a road awakening in a few years if this gets slammed down doctors are
[1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:30.440]  going to revolt and I'll have to tell you full disclosure here's how doctors
[1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:35.680]  revolt they either drop out or they game the system now the patients want
[1:13:35.680 --> 1:13:40.480]  that you want to be gamed you want your doctor to drop out let's deal with with
[1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:44.640]  a real myth that you're going to get to keep the doctor you got now till he
[1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:49.520]  quits you know great great great great quote get to keep the doctor you have
[1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:53.480]  now so you know physicians are being completely ignored in this whole
[1:13:53.480 --> 1:13:59.320]  discussion and a few of us have loud voices but but clearly the debate with
[1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:04.560]  it why would you would you have a debate about about about who's operating
[1:14:04.560 --> 1:14:07.960]  your train without talking about the conductor would you say let's let's
[1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:12.160]  pad the seats let's get new dining cars by the way the engineers quitting who's
[1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:15.840]  driving the train well that's like that's like the government says they're
[1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:20.880]  going to put screen doors on submarines without consulting the the engineer who
[1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:24.960]  designed the submarine but I mean it's totally the case and I don't want you
[1:14:24.960 --> 1:14:28.160]  listeners to think by the way that I only care about doctors but there's a
[1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:31.720]  trickle trickle down effect here because everybody knows that when you go to the
[1:14:31.720 --> 1:14:34.560]  doctor's office you're not meeting President Obama you're meeting your
[1:14:34.560 --> 1:14:38.720]  physician and it's not that I and by the way one more thing that I don't think
[1:14:38.720 --> 1:14:42.440]  I've ever said before I want to make a really really important point here you
[1:14:42.440 --> 1:14:47.960]  know doctors are not the same doctors that we were dealing with in 1964 when
[1:14:47.960 --> 1:14:52.480]  Medicare came down the pike those doctors were definitely living high on the
[1:14:52.480 --> 1:14:55.400]  hog and there was a lot of fat on the bone now I don't happen to think that
[1:14:55.400 --> 1:14:59.600]  fat was chipped off the bone in the right way I don't think HMOs work very
[1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:03.360]  well and I know that the government insurance doesn't but the doctors we
[1:15:03.360 --> 1:15:07.760]  have now are very close to the bone they have very very high overhead they're
[1:15:07.760 --> 1:15:12.000]  working their butts off they're seeing 40 patients a day we want to see 60 I mean
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:15.920]  let's plug their offices with with millions of more patients and pay them
[1:15:15.920 --> 1:15:20.160]  less and hospitals we're gonna cut well I've seen it with nurses that's why they
[1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:24.080]  got such a shortage there and it's a hellish job because they are overworking
[1:15:24.080 --> 1:15:28.840]  everybody and they use a few specialists on TV to demonize the profession in the
[1:15:28.840 --> 1:15:32.300]  five minutes we got left I want to plug your websites Dr. Siegel dot com that's
[1:15:32.300 --> 1:15:35.520]  dr. Siegel dot com I wanted to specifically get into eugenics though
[1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:39.880]  you said it's almost like eugenics well the bioethicist boards have a lot of
[1:15:39.880 --> 1:15:44.520]  eugenicist ideas in them Europe as you know that they've said of your old you
[1:15:44.520 --> 1:15:49.400]  don't deserve the same care as a young person we know that Dashel's book said
[1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:53.840]  if you're old you don't deserve the care so I can I mean can you elaborate as a
[1:15:53.840 --> 1:15:58.600]  as a well-known prominent physician why you use the word eugenics because we're
[1:15:58.600 --> 1:16:02.720]  trained in medical school not to make any difference between one patient and
[1:16:02.720 --> 1:16:06.680]  another I've talked about that endlessly and thought about that I don't I don't
[1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:10.080]  treat you know overweight people differently than skinny people except
[1:16:10.080 --> 1:16:14.560]  that I might focus on being overweight as a problem I don't say this patient has
[1:16:14.560 --> 1:16:18.440]  no money I'm gonna treat them less I don't say this person's rich I'm gonna
[1:16:18.440 --> 1:16:22.360]  treat them better my patients wouldn't have it any other way so where's the
[1:16:22.360 --> 1:16:27.200]  government coming along saying you know things like Ezekiel manual has
[1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:32.400]  written about life years too many life years I mean what is that all about why
[1:16:32.400 --> 1:16:36.960]  don't elderly deserve the same care as young people a patient is a patient is
[1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:41.000]  a patient that's the only doctors can practice and it's the only way health
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:45.560]  care can be delivered and it's what the United States wants and they're they're
[1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:50.120]  phrasing it in the media and the government like it's good like you want
[1:16:50.120 --> 1:16:54.400]  the government taking tests away you want the government giving you a has a
[1:16:54.400 --> 1:16:58.680]  aspirin for a heart attack like Cuba I mean this is crazy well I don't think the
[1:16:58.680 --> 1:17:01.360]  government I think the biggest issue with the government by the way is that
[1:17:01.360 --> 1:17:04.720]  they don't have the qualification and that you never mind that there that they
[1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:08.200]  do such a great job with the IRS and with the post office but they you know
[1:17:08.200 --> 1:17:11.080]  they're just learning their talking points now I mean they're going to
[1:17:11.080 --> 1:17:15.520]  seminars and tutorials on health care I mean you can you know that's the thing
[1:17:15.520 --> 1:17:20.200]  that's most disturbing here of all I wouldn't you know I watch politics with
[1:17:20.200 --> 1:17:23.720]  a John this guy to begin with but where do these guys get off thinking they can
[1:17:23.720 --> 1:17:28.040]  be health care experts that's the biggest bearing of false witness here to
[1:17:28.040 --> 1:17:32.400]  begin with I mean when did it with this guy getting MD from you know we're in
[1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:36.240]  this for I've been in this for two decades already and I'm not just a
[1:17:36.240 --> 1:17:39.200]  practicing position as you know I'm writing about this I've been writing
[1:17:39.200 --> 1:17:43.200]  about health policy for 10 years I studied this very carefully there's too
[1:17:43.200 --> 1:17:47.880]  many people in this dealing with this ramming this down our throats who are
[1:17:47.880 --> 1:17:51.440]  not qualified to be looking at health care and health reform but they are
[1:17:51.440 --> 1:17:55.160]  qualified to steal 20% of the country's economy that's not under government
[1:17:55.160 --> 1:17:58.680]  control so they can give it to their fat cat buddies is now coming out in
[1:17:58.680 --> 1:18:03.760]  closing the flu I've seen no US media I'd love for you to break this
[1:18:03.760 --> 1:18:08.200]  nationally you've got the power to do it the Sunday mail the London Telegraph
[1:18:08.200 --> 1:18:13.840]  German news reports swine flu jab link the killer nerve disease leaked letter
[1:18:13.840 --> 1:18:18.760]  reveals concern of neurologist over 25 deaths in America in the test alone of
[1:18:18.760 --> 1:18:25.520]  the vaccine by Gillian Bernays and other deaths of neurological it's switching
[1:18:25.520 --> 1:18:30.320]  on some autoimmune response massive brain swelling doctor your comments on
[1:18:30.320 --> 1:18:36.560]  this and the news saying three shots can mutate in the body well look I think
[1:18:36.560 --> 1:18:40.600]  it's a mild virus I think that as you hit it before I came on we don't know
[1:18:40.600 --> 1:18:43.320]  how it's going to be hyped yet we don't know what the administration is going to
[1:18:43.320 --> 1:18:46.960]  do to hype it I think it's a mild virus but I do think it's made its way around
[1:18:46.960 --> 1:18:50.040]  the world and I think we have to pay particular attention to it I don't think
[1:18:50.040 --> 1:18:53.800]  we can ignore it but the hysteria is totally ridiculous I think we need a
[1:18:53.800 --> 1:18:58.560]  vaccine to it but the vaccine that is problematic because in 1976 we had it
[1:18:58.560 --> 1:19:02.280]  we had a what we thought was a swine flu epidemic which was completely fabricated
[1:19:02.280 --> 1:19:05.880]  it turned out and we ended up with close to a thousand cases of ascending
[1:19:05.880 --> 1:19:10.920]  paralysis as a result that could happen again but I don't want to use fear of
[1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:14.160]  the vaccine to replace fear of the virus I don't like fear in general I
[1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:20.280]  written books on this but the doctor we got 30 seconds my issue here is that is
[1:19:20.280 --> 1:19:24.960]  that internal CDC they're saying keep I mean were you aware of this it's not in
[1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:30.560]  our news you are aware I'm aware of it but I don't but I don't know to the
[1:19:30.560 --> 1:19:36.000]  extent to which it's a problem versus 76 in other words it remains to be seen how
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:40.520]  significant a side effect this is before I go and tell people be afraid of this
[1:19:40.520 --> 1:19:44.480]  vaccine I want to see more about what a risk this really is exactly but they're
[1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:48.120]  keeping it secret so shouldn't that be public shouldn't there be a big debate
[1:19:48.120 --> 1:19:50.880]  about this there should be a big debate about this but I'm telling you right now
[1:19:50.880 --> 1:19:54.280]  I'm always on the side of the facts and I want to close by saying I think the
[1:19:54.280 --> 1:19:59.200]  vaccine is going to be safe Dr. Siegel dot com doc thanks for talking to us on

[1:21:13.840 --> 1:21:18.000]  deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:22.560]  interest of the American people while Obama's already fudging yeah but since
[1:21:22.560 --> 1:21:27.000]  day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:31.720]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[1:21:31.720 --> 1:21:38.560]  bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascist it's not about left to right
[1:21:38.560 --> 1:21:44.120]  it's about a one-world government this film documents who Obama works for the

[1:21:56.120 --> 1:22:02.200]  Obama deception the people strike back hello Ted Anderson listeners of the
[1:22:02.200 --> 1:22:05.400]  network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks
[1:22:05.400 --> 1:22:09.120]  of deficit spending therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no
[1:22:09.120 --> 1:22:12.520]  surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash
[1:22:12.520 --> 1:22:15.880]  depositors can remove from their accounts a fractional reserve system
[1:22:15.880 --> 1:22:19.560]  means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate
[1:22:19.560 --> 1:22:23.320]  withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is
[1:22:23.320 --> 1:22:27.480]  forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a
[1:22:27.480 --> 1:22:31.080]  current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to
[1:22:31.080 --> 1:22:35.040]  increase liquidity for depositors however an increase in money supply without
[1:22:35.040 --> 1:22:38.880]  equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve
[1:22:38.880 --> 1:22:43.160]  strength and stability I recommend a conservative portion of all investments
[1:22:43.160 --> 1:22:47.640]  to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently
[1:22:47.640 --> 1:22:52.840]  have been driven by debt gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years for

[1:23:08.200 --> 1:23:11.840]  economy it's no surprise that identity theft has increased with current
[1:23:11.840 --> 1:23:15.600]  technology thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal

[1:24:36.440 --> 1:24:39.800]  quote you know acceptable level of side effects because you know that's what they
[1:24:39.800 --> 1:24:44.760]  do they triage they say well if this vaccine saves 10,000 people but it
[1:24:44.760 --> 1:24:48.240]  kills a thousand you know it's okay that's that's kind of the medical idea
[1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:53.840]  not saying seagulls saying that but it's in the same general idea and area they
[1:24:53.840 --> 1:24:58.760]  know it doesn't protect you from the flu they know it's already mutated that you
[1:24:58.760 --> 1:25:02.480]  know their history of adding stuff to it you've got to admit what this medical
[1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:07.040]  systems doing hyping this flu that's killed almost nobody up like it's the
[1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:11.480]  end of the world this is a big deal we're going to expose it with the contest

[1:26:08.440 --> 1:26:11.720]  off the grid and here's a good way to do just that a solar power generators now
[1:26:11.720 --> 1:26:15.560]  available from our good and wonderful longtime sponsors solution from science
[1:26:15.560 --> 1:26:20.760]  websites my solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com they have the
[1:26:20.760 --> 1:26:25.320]  power source 1800 watt generator and high efficiency solar panel designed to
[1:26:25.320 --> 1:26:29.400]  provide endless electricity remember to that gas generators need gas but in a
[1:26:29.400 --> 1:26:34.280]  blackout gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity it's the
[1:26:34.280 --> 1:26:38.840]  perfect emergency backup for troubled times the government doesn't own the sun
[1:26:38.840 --> 1:26:44.520]  yet folks to make you move today my solar backup dot com or 877-327-0363

[1:28:00.720 --> 1:28:05.280]  he's been calling us we need to call him and explain this is all fraud and the
[1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:11.480]  police told the young man that we know this is selective enforcement and that
[1:28:11.480 --> 1:28:15.840]  they don't normally go after people from this but it's political pressure and
[1:28:15.840 --> 1:28:19.720]  then Obama supporters were there snapping photos of people doing it and
[1:28:19.720 --> 1:28:24.240]  saying we're gonna turn you in just like Obama told them to do on his own
[1:28:24.240 --> 1:28:29.440]  website so again this is a big big issue will have more for you on the
[1:28:29.440 --> 1:28:36.400]  abbreviated Sunday show as well in other news the dollar is plunging all the
[1:28:36.400 --> 1:28:40.640]  real economic numbers show commodities exploding because of dollar devaluation
[1:28:40.640 --> 1:28:46.520]  takes more dollars worldwide to buy those governments are moving away from the
[1:28:46.520 --> 1:28:51.000]  dollar unemployment skyrocketing every real economic indicator is we're dead
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  meat meanwhile the media is telling you the economy is great because it is for
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:58.600]  the big bankers and the billionaires and the people that control trillions this
[1:28:58.600 --> 1:29:02.760]  is their big consolidation their vertical integration because we're armed
[1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:05.920]  they can't come in with a Soviet takeover right away so they can
[1:29:05.920 --> 1:29:10.120]  economically rape us and Obama's their front man take the blame of that just
[1:29:10.120 --> 1:29:14.320]  like Bush was involved we have got to expose the offshore banks for stealing
[1:29:14.320 --> 1:29:18.160]  twenty three point seven trillion in the last ten months hoarding that money and
[1:29:18.160 --> 1:29:23.880]  paying banks not to loan to the citizens to kill the economy so the banks can
[1:29:23.880 --> 1:29:28.320]  force a consolidation they want a destroyed economy not your local bank
[1:29:28.320 --> 1:29:33.360]  the big multinational king banks want to destroy the economy so they can
[1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:38.280]  consolidate it and vertically integrate it want to say great job to the crew here

[1:30:05.080 --> 1:30:08.640]  this summer number one new climate legislation could easily double or

[1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:06.080]  wanted to get Cindy Sheehan on we appreciate her popping in to give us a
[1:34:06.080 --> 1:34:11.400]  report on what's happening Martha's vineyard one of the favorite hangouts of
[1:34:11.400 --> 1:34:16.200]  the Clintons and Walter Cronkite and kind of the eastern establishment of the
[1:34:16.200 --> 1:34:24.160]  eugenicist clan and Cindy Sheehan who lost her son of course in Iraq became a
[1:34:24.160 --> 1:34:28.440]  national icon standing up to Bush at the Crawford Ranch now Obama's in the news
[1:34:28.440 --> 1:34:32.560]  saying please give my family privacy over this spy satellites and NSA phone
[1:34:32.560 --> 1:34:37.600]  tapping and his blackwater thugs they're not giving us any rest and so
[1:34:37.600 --> 1:34:41.040]  there's hardly any mainstream media at least I searched it this morning I saw
[1:34:41.040 --> 1:34:46.120]  some about Cindy Sheehan with all these other great peace activists because
[1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:51.360]  again it was trending and fun to protest Bush knowing he wouldn't in the war for
[1:34:51.360 --> 1:34:55.160]  the establishment but now that they're in power like Rahm Emanuel said you know
[1:34:55.160 --> 1:34:59.440]  he campaigned against Democrats and ran the Democratic Party operation against
[1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:04.240]  Democrats that were actually against war and the corporate guys tried to throw
[1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:07.880]  Dennis Kucinich out because he's actually a real liberal and against war and a
[1:35:07.880 --> 1:35:11.440]  real progressive so Cindy Sheehan is out there shattering a left-right paradigm
[1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:16.480]  we've been publishing an info wars.com and prisonpana.com the articles and
[1:35:16.480 --> 1:35:20.360]  reports he's been putting out they've got YouTube videos up get her
[1:35:20.360 --> 1:35:25.120]  information out viral and ask the media why aren't you covering this more
[1:35:25.120 --> 1:35:29.440]  troops are dying under Obama than under Bush he's expanding the wars all his
[1:35:29.440 --> 1:35:34.000]  top generals say 10 to 15 years before they leave they rewrote the maps of the
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:37.920]  US bases so they weren't part of the cities to claim they left the cities
[1:35:37.920 --> 1:35:45.040]  corporate lawyer semantical games Cindy Sheehan from Martha's Vineyard site of
[1:35:45.040 --> 1:35:48.320]  Lord Obama vacationing Cindy good to have you here with us
[1:35:48.320 --> 1:35:54.560]  hi Alex thank you so much for helping to promote this protest and promote the
[1:35:54.560 --> 1:35:59.320]  fact that like you said even though there's a change in regime there's the
[1:35:59.320 --> 1:36:04.200]  only change in policy has been for the worst and and we just really do reclaim
[1:36:04.200 --> 1:36:11.160]  our integrity and our morality in the anti-war movement to to say that the
[1:36:11.160 --> 1:36:16.000]  wars we were right to say the wrong under Bush and we're still right to say
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:21.200]  they're still wrong under Obama and to me it's a lack of media coverage but it's
[1:36:21.200 --> 1:36:30.000]  also a lack of any kind of cooperation or solidarity that I'm not received from
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:35.400]  the establishment anti-war movement well that's because the Ford Foundation that's
[1:36:35.400 --> 1:36:39.360]  because the Ford Foundation as you know and these other big money groups run and
[1:36:39.360 --> 1:36:43.480]  control the fake left it's just I mean where is Amy Goodman where are all
[1:36:43.480 --> 1:36:48.760]  these groups continue please Cindy Sheehan tell us what's happening out there
[1:36:48.760 --> 1:36:52.840]  how many people are out there where you're located so other people could
[1:36:52.840 --> 1:36:56.520]  come join you how long you're going to be there what the Secret Service is
[1:36:56.520 --> 1:37:25.960]  doing all I can say for the moment is that to get a list of events they can go to my blog or see your website and it's that Cindy Sheehan so boxboxbox.com the first event that we're going to have is organized will be a corporate media conference tomorrow at 11 so we'll see how much how much coverage we get protesting Obama but another thing is that we're
[1:37:25.960 --> 1:37:53.560]  going to be writing the people all over the world an international people's declaration of peace and that's to start a grassroots movement because as I said so many times a rubber class doesn't want to change you know we can't force a rubber class to change especially if so many of our so-called opposition has been co-opted by the by the two-party system or
[1:37:53.560 --> 1:38:11.560]  whatever whatever you want to call it so we're going to be writing that we hope that we'll get solidarity from from you and from your listeners on this people declaration of peace that we'll be writing and I'm staying just right around the corner from Obama so I'm hoping to bump into him if he ventures out of his compound
[1:38:11.560 --> 1:38:27.560]  now again for people geographically tell folks where Martha's Vineyard is where the press conference is a lot of people aren't online or I mean how do people come out to this do we call the media challenge them to be there what do we do
[1:38:27.560 --> 1:38:53.560]  well absolutely you know the media is already there because Obama's there so what we have to do is you can call the media station at Oak Bluff Elementary School that's where the press conference is going to be tomorrow at 11 we're having a large anti-war rally on Saturday if people who are in Massachusetts or around this area can get to Martha's Vineyard
[1:38:53.560 --> 1:39:15.560]  we will have a large visual rally teach in against the war the island's fairly small and we're going to blink at the island we have support from people on Martha's Vineyard who have offered us housing offered us places to hang our banners places to put signs places to do our visual so we're going to be all over that island
[1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:25.560]  because we don't want Obama or the press or the anti-war movement to not know that we're there still protesting the war as we were when Bush was president
[1:39:25.560 --> 1:39:42.560]  what response are you starting to get I mean I do see you getting more attention than you were a few months ago what are some of the positive responses you're getting from the anti-war community or just the sanity community and what responses are you getting that are negative
[1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:58.560]  well it's interesting that the negative responses I'm getting are from people who I think call themselves anti-war progressives saying that I should give Obama a rest that I should have a peaceful vacation
[1:39:58.560 --> 1:40:13.560]  well I like you know four of our troops were killed yesterday in Afghanistan I don't know even know how many Afghans or Pakistanis were killed yesterday and they're getting a long rest now
[1:40:13.560 --> 1:40:22.560]  exactly exactly so why does he deserve a peaceful vacation the world deserves a vacation for more and a vacation for body bags it doesn't stop no matter what the president does
[1:40:22.560 --> 1:40:35.560]  and by the way Cindy we know what this war is about I mean I saw Admiral Mullen on CNN two nights ago making up stuff about why the opium has gone over 12 times what it was I mean since the liberation and then BBC admits
[1:40:35.560 --> 1:40:45.560]  oh we guard the opium so the warlords don't get it and then suddenly heroin is all over the streets they're there just like the Russians were there to get that smack
[1:40:45.560 --> 1:41:00.560]  right well and then also there's a there's the whole pipeline thing to get to get the oil to aid us from from the Middle East of course it's our profit of course that's right
[1:41:00.560 --> 1:41:23.560]  that's what they're always for so that's what we're doing is we're getting a lot of excitement we're getting I'm getting mostly support which is a very gratifying to me and thank you for your support and letting your listeners and your viewers know what we're doing because that's really important too
[1:41:23.560 --> 1:41:32.560]  well I mean where are you bivouacked how the folks physically get in a car right now get over there how long are you going to be there again
[1:41:32.560 --> 1:41:48.560]  I'm going to be here until Sunday when the president leaves so like I said we're going to be all over the island they can there's phone numbers that people can call to find out where we're going to be exactly if people can get over there's
[1:41:48.560 --> 1:42:02.560]  emails people can email me directly Cindy Cindy see him so calm if you tell us if not like Crawford where we had a camp it's going to we're going to be all over that island every day
[1:42:02.560 --> 1:42:16.560]  well Cindy this is very exciting and I'd like to get some updates from you again throughout the week here and maybe on Sunday on the Sunday show when it's all over kind of a recapping final event for people out there driving along in their cars or listening on short wave or whatever
[1:42:16.560 --> 1:42:21.560]  or on satellite slowly give out the website address again
[1:42:21.560 --> 1:42:50.560]  okay Cindy see him so box dot box dot com there's a schedule of time date some places where we will be for sure that we know already there there's a place where people can donate to help us with expenses and just a place where you can see that the ideology or the philosophy of why we're out there
[1:42:50.560 --> 1:43:02.560]  Cindy let me ask you a question of in closing are you getting any media coming to you before they were mobbing you you were having to hide the trailer giving interviews 15 hours a day
[1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:05.560]  now what's happening
[1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:19.560]  there seems to be some interest I talked to some corporate media newspapers today so it's not like it was when I was in Crawford that's for sure so I find that very interesting
[1:43:19.560 --> 1:43:34.560]  well I mean number one it's a great story Cindy she and now back you know this has been going on for seven years here Cindy she and you know five years into this now she's back it's still happening under Obama that's a big story
[1:43:34.560 --> 1:43:41.560]  I've been trying to be low key until our president tomorrow so after the president tomorrow we'll see what happens
[1:43:41.560 --> 1:43:44.560]  okay we'll check in with you again Cindy she and thank you
[1:43:44.560 --> 1:43:46.560]  okay great Alex thank you
[1:43:46.560 --> 1:43:56.560]  thank you so much and again we'll definitely at least check in with her Sunday in the aftermath of all of this the media should be knocking her door down but but but but no
[1:43:56.560 --> 1:44:11.560]  it's so trendy and fun to have Obama's trying to start wars with the Russians and putting more troops into Afghanistan and wanting to go into Pakistan and predator drones and 100,000 plus troops still in Iraq and never leaving
[1:44:11.560 --> 1:44:30.560]  I mean it's an insult to my intelligence it's an insult to your intelligence to have the media and the Iraqi government under orders of the globalist redraw their city maps where the green zone and other bases aren't part of the cities now
[1:44:30.560 --> 1:44:52.560]  and then say our troops have pulled out I mean this is a very cynical cynical joke and they did pull back in one respect they pulled out the two year old surge took troops out of the fortresses and put them in machine gun nest and checkpoints kind of like community policing
[1:44:52.560 --> 1:45:09.560]  and now they pulled those out so it's amazing it's kind of like cutting somebody's leg off and saying open I'm trying to fix it and giving them a bandaid I mean it's too little too late it's a joke it's cosmetic it's a corporate front
[1:45:09.560 --> 1:45:23.560]  I want to keep going to your phone calls for Dr. Eisenstein joins us I also want to get into Bernackie being nominated for another term as private fellow reserve chairman the rest of the boards appointed by them but he's the little front man
[1:45:23.560 --> 1:45:42.560]  Geithner's the former head of the New York Fed that's the real powerhouse in the corporate structure that's coming up also judge orders fed to disclose who received bailout trillions Paul Joseph Watson key story up on prisonplanet.com big news judge orders fed to disclose who received bailout trillions
[1:45:42.560 --> 1:46:00.560]  I said billions you're the mind has trouble dealing with trillions you used to have trouble a decade ago with billions now it's trillions soon it'll be quadrillions well it already is in the quadrillions the total black hole of debt that we're dealing with with the derivatives
[1:46:00.560 --> 1:46:24.560]  I wanted to tell folks that up on prisonplanet.com and info wars.com we have the first detailed write up of my new film that is nearing completion that is we've got two hours laid out and I'm trying to put this in take that out add this document add that clip working on a few final voiceovers and I'll polish it
[1:46:24.560 --> 1:46:43.560]  in the next three four weeks and we've got to be mass manufactured pre-order start September 21st and they ship out a few days before the official release date at prisonplanet.tv will release there in the highest quality it ships out on DVD a few days before that so you should be getting it in or around the release time
[1:46:43.560 --> 1:47:02.560]  we're trying to even make the DVD earlier and then hold it so we can ship it out even faster but the pre-orders will start coming up in about three four weeks and I guess about three and a half weeks and I wanted to go ahead and play the trailer to the new film
[1:47:02.560 --> 1:47:20.560]  so here is trailer one for fall of the Republic and I want to say great job to the music guys here we've used Graham Reynolds in the past and I've also bought royalty free music in the past and Rob Jacobs has made music in the past this time we've been using Derek
[1:47:20.560 --> 1:47:35.560]  Einkopf and will and a few others in the opposite of fabulous job this is a quick mix this is kind of a raw trailer because I realize I've been so focused on the film that I wasn't even focused on trailer to promote it but so we've got even more powerful trailers coming out in the next few weeks
[1:47:35.560 --> 1:48:01.560]  so this is a great trailer Rob Jacobs and put together and it says the following film preview is rated vital to the Republic and necessary for all audiences in defense of Liberty it's rated V for viral transmission in the info war spread this film everywhere through viral transmission to keep and preserve the Constitution and defeat tyranny in all its forms here it is fall of the Republic
[1:48:01.560 --> 1:48:25.560]  last week the head of the country's central bank loaded the idea of dumping the green back as the world's reserve currency replacing it with an international currency
[1:48:25.560 --> 1:48:36.560]  thousands of people gathered to hear Barack Obama deliver key foreign policy speech on his current European tour his vision for America's place in a new world order
[1:48:36.560 --> 1:48:47.560]  returning vets could be a risk to our nation we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see
[1:48:47.560 --> 1:49:05.560]  and one of the ways it will drive the changes through global governance I think the new world order is emerging this is a hoax and a scam which is designed to transfer wealth and power from the private sector to the government sector and from the government of the United States to a world government
[1:49:05.560 --> 1:49:21.560]  and those people who have been yelling oh the U.N. is going to take over global government conspiracy theories they've been crazy but now they're right and who got the money hundreds and hundreds of banks any bank that has access to the U.S. Federal Reserve system
[1:49:21.560 --> 1:49:37.560]  and tell us who they are no you know financial terrorism they have the ability to tweak the knob I am proposing that the Federal Reserve be granted new authority the ultimate goal of the carbon tax and the cap and trade is to destroy production
[1:49:37.560 --> 1:49:51.560]  this energy tax is the largest tax increase in American history we're actually creating a global warming police so number one they can come in the federal government can come in and inspect your house and send you the bill we're setting up a global warming
[1:49:51.560 --> 1:50:11.560]  one of the things that if you talk to our guys they are desperate for is a civilian counterpart to our military forces I am fierce and this is what I wear
[1:50:11.560 --> 1:50:24.560]  Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign is asking Missouri law enforcement to target anyone who lies or runs the misleading television ads I've now been in 57 states I think one left to go
[1:50:24.560 --> 1:50:30.560]  the president when he was in Europe last week he met with the king of Saudi Arabia he appeared to Bob
[1:50:30.560 --> 1:50:50.560]  President Obama today proposed something new something called prolonged detention pre crimes where people are arrested and incarcerated to prevent crimes that they have not yet committed
[1:50:50.560 --> 1:51:01.560]  the role of the republic coming to the info war October 21st 2009 stay with us

[1:52:16.560 --> 1:52:25.560]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:52:25.560 --> 1:52:32.560]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[1:52:32.560 --> 1:52:41.560]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off in year 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[1:54:00.560 --> 1:54:16.560]  I say I shot Chery, but that's where it was in San Diego. Chery of John Brown one day was coming down the road. He was going to shoot me. That's not shot him.
[1:54:16.560 --> 1:54:45.560]  And I started out of town here. All of a sudden I saw Chery turn around. He came in to shoot me down. So I shot, I shot, I shot him down. And I say, if I am guilty I will pay.
[1:54:45.560 --> 1:54:57.560]  I shot Chery, but I say, if I am guilty I will pay. I shot Chery, but I say, if I am guilty I will pay. I shot Chery.
[1:54:57.560 --> 1:55:16.560]  Okay, we got Dr. Eisenstein coming up eight after. I'm going to take calls in the next segment of the AMA Dr. Eisenstein as well. I really want to try to take more of your calls when we're on the show because just so many great callers, so much intel, so much info that is going on and happening out there.
[1:55:16.560 --> 1:55:34.560]  Before I go any further here today, I again want to encourage everybody to get really part one of Fall the Republic. And that is, of course, the Obama deception available at infowars.com.
[1:55:34.560 --> 1:55:46.560]  Also, PrismPlanet.tv, we stream the live radio show in Living Color. It has all my films in super high quality. The archives of this radio show, of the TV show, of everything.

[1:56:47.560 --> 1:57:01.560]  The unit is a video and audio recorder device disguised as a pen and as a unbiased witness, it can always be at your side, ready to help and is admissible as evidence in the court if necessary.
[1:57:01.560 --> 1:57:09.560]  With the two and four gig models, you can record two hours or more of continuous audio video and you will not believe the quality when you see it for the first time.

[1:57:29.560 --> 1:57:42.560]  Be good for YouTube people. They want to just record themselves while they're driving down the road, take it out with their buddies, having a fun discussion, pop it right in for YouTube, upload it. There's just all sorts of uses for diginet.net.
[1:57:42.560 --> 1:57:52.560]  And one other sponsor is Acola Blue. This is the fantastic atmospheric water generator. It's the system I love. I use it in my home and the office.

[1:58:50.560 --> 1:58:58.560]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[1:58:58.560 --> 1:59:05.560]  My answer would be all I can get. In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[1:59:05.560 --> 1:59:13.560]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification?
[1:59:13.560 --> 1:59:21.560]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[1:59:21.560 --> 1:59:24.560]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:59:24.560 --> 1:59:34.560]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[1:59:34.560 --> 1:59:59.560]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[2:00:04.560 --> 2:00:16.560]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:16.560 --> 2:00:21.560]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:21.560 --> 2:00:39.560]  Barack Obama depicted a zombie killer in New Comic Book. Is that racist? Is that wrong? Should we all be arrested by the Thought Police?
[2:00:39.560 --> 2:00:52.560]  He says they've portrayed the president as a New Comic Book series named as he plays on words with the popular horror franchise Resident Evil.
[2:00:52.560 --> 2:01:02.560]  And it's Obama with chainsaws as a superhero killing zombies. Yeah, it was okay to show him as Superman, to show him as Batman, but you don't show him as the Joker.
[2:01:02.560 --> 2:01:11.560]  Why, I need to be arrested for doing that. And anybody else does too. You don't talk bad about the president. That's illegal because we don't have free speech in America. Everybody knows that.
[2:01:11.560 --> 2:01:20.560]  Well, I got news for you. We're going to talk about whatever we want here. Let's go to Jeff in Oregon and Donna in Texas, Bill, Gene, Pat, and others. Jeff, you're on the air. Welcome.
[2:01:20.560 --> 2:01:32.560]  Well, yes, good morning, Alex. Just a question here. I happen to be listening to Dr. Tenpenny on with Norrie. I think it was last week.
[2:01:32.560 --> 2:01:47.560]  And I'm just wondering, she hinted that she's thinking it will not be a forced inoculation, but rather a de facto criminalization of refusing the inoculation.
[2:01:47.560 --> 2:01:53.560]  No, no, no, no, no. Yeah, you won't fly. You'll have to stay in your house. They'll arrest you. They won't let you go to work.
[2:01:53.560 --> 2:01:59.560]  And then in the future, you have to take all their other vaccines or you can't go to work. That's exactly how they're planning to do it.
[2:01:59.560 --> 2:02:07.560]  In fact, let's set Tenpenny back up for the show. She's learned a lot more now about this current flu situation. She's been picking up a lot of new data.
[2:02:07.560 --> 2:02:12.560]  And let's also set up Horowitz, Horowitz and Tenpenny. But go ahead, sir.
[2:02:12.560 --> 2:02:22.560]  So, you know, the thing that disturbs me about this is when she said that, of course, last night I was listening to the replay of when you interviewed Ike.
[2:02:22.560 --> 2:02:35.560]  I think it was the last time you interviewed Ike. And he seems to, and other people who talk about the New World Order, seem to come back to our best defenses to peacefully resist.
[2:02:35.560 --> 2:02:45.560]  The problem is, and it seems that nobody wants to talk about this, not Dr. Stan, not Ike, not anyone. They're not going to let you peacefully resist.
[2:02:45.560 --> 2:02:52.560]  I understand that. That's why we don't offensively go out, because then they can cast us as the bad guy.
[2:02:52.560 --> 2:02:58.560]  When we defend ourselves, there's no way for them to demonize it. But we try to reach out to military and police.
[2:02:58.560 --> 2:03:05.560]  We've got police, the military, the nurses associations in Europe and the U.S. The majority of them.
[2:03:05.560 --> 2:03:13.560]  Two weeks ago, it was 35% of nurses say no. This week, it was last night, I saw over 60% in New York State.
[2:03:13.560 --> 2:03:23.560]  Look, they're not going to get away with it, but they're going to come back over and over again with wanting to put things in our bodies, because that's what the eugenicists are into.
[2:03:23.560 --> 2:03:30.560]  That's their zero population growth. That's what the government textbooks call for. That's what they want. So they want to set that precedent.
[2:03:30.560 --> 2:03:35.560]  That's why they love pharmacological crops. They're already engineering the crops to do this. Yeah, there's a poll.
[2:03:35.560 --> 2:03:49.560]  Half of doctors will refuse to take swine flu shot. Steve Watson, that came out today.
[2:03:49.560 --> 2:03:51.560]  So very, very interesting. Anything else, sir?
[2:03:51.560 --> 2:04:02.560]  Yeah, did you say that Israel 75% of the doctors were against the vaccine, but they're going to vaccinate the entire population anyway?
[2:04:02.560 --> 2:04:05.560]  I don't remember saying that.
[2:04:05.560 --> 2:04:12.560]  I must have heard that from somebody else. So Alex, you are the Sean Connery character in Outland. Well done.
[2:04:12.560 --> 2:04:22.560]  What am I like going around with a shotgun fighting with the company hit men that are trying to sell some amphetamine drug?
[2:04:22.560 --> 2:04:29.560]  That's a good movie. Outland with Sean Connery. Have you ever seen it? It's a good science fiction movie.
[2:04:29.560 --> 2:04:38.560]  It's really like a Western set on some moon of Saturn, I think. They're running a mining operation. It's a good movie.
[2:04:38.560 --> 2:04:47.560]  Sean Connery should have done more serious roles like that. Said it's like Highlander.
[2:04:47.560 --> 2:04:53.560]  Oh my God. I like Sean Connery movies like Thunderball. It's a good movie.
[2:04:53.560 --> 2:05:00.560]  All right, we're going to come back with Dr. Eisenstein. Stay with us.
[2:05:00.560 --> 2:05:12.560]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[2:05:12.560 --> 2:05:15.560]  You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.
[2:05:15.560 --> 2:05:31.560]  The Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness. Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[2:05:31.560 --> 2:05:47.560]  They even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health manager. I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee, infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system. Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[2:06:00.560 --> 2:06:06.560]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question. Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[2:06:06.560 --> 2:06:20.560]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water. Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases.
[2:06:20.560 --> 2:06:22.560]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[2:06:22.560 --> 2:06:40.560]  The Acola Blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water. The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[2:06:40.560 --> 2:07:00.560]  This is Alex Jones. Have you heard of the millionaire patriot? Well you should. He has a free handgun and 5 days of firearms training waiting for you. That's right. You can't do that.
[2:07:00.560 --> 2:07:18.560]  This is Alex Jones. Have you heard of the millionaire patriot? Well you should. He has a free handgun and 5 days of firearms training waiting for you. That's right. You can attend 5 days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[2:07:18.560 --> 2:07:34.560]  All for pennies on the dollar, plus if you act fast, the millionaire patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice. I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[2:07:34.560 --> 2:07:50.560]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes. This is real. Don't miss out. Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course, plus a 30-state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.

[2:08:20.560 --> 2:08:30.560]  It's an amazing book. Don't vaccinate before you educate. This is the book to give friends, family, neighbors to inform them about what's really happening.
[2:08:30.560 --> 2:08:39.560]  Dr. Mayor Eisenstein is a graduate of the University of Illinois Medical School, the Medical College of Wisconsin School of Public Health, and the John Marshall Law School.
[2:08:39.560 --> 2:08:55.560]  In his 33 years in medicine, he has practiced, have cared for more than 75,000 patients, grandparents, and children. He is board certified by the National Board of Medical Examiners, American Board of Public Health and Preventative Medicine.
[2:08:55.560 --> 2:09:11.560]  He's like a super doctor and a lawyer, and the American Board of Quality Assurance and Utilization Review Physicians. He is recipient of the Howard Fellowship Health Professional Scholarship, University of Illinois School of Medicine Scholarship, and a member of the Illinois Bar.
[2:09:11.560 --> 2:09:25.560]  He is the author of Give Birth at Home with the Home Birth Advantage Safe Medicine. Don't vaccinate before you educate. Unequivocally dangerous medical hazards of HRT and unlocking nature's pharmacy.
[2:09:25.560 --> 2:09:46.560]  His medical film is, which means in Latin, above all, do no harm. They've gotten rid of the Hippocratic oath, so that's good to still keep that alive. And a documentary on harm birth was an award winner at the Chicago Film Festival and HomeFirst.com is just one of his websites, HomeFirst.com.
[2:09:46.560 --> 2:10:00.560]  Doc, I got you on about vaccines, and it's been too long, and like two years since I've had you on. There is so much to go into, but we were talking during the break. Please repeat the point you made when I was first talking to you.
[2:10:00.560 --> 2:10:18.560]  Let me tell you, Alex, it is a true report, a comment. As I've been following this, I've been blessed. I'm a student of the late Dr. Mendelssohn, so I knew that vaccines were dangerous, because he knew about that 35 years ago, and so most of my practice and none of my children have been vaccinated.
[2:10:18.560 --> 2:10:32.560]  But when you were talking about eugenics, population control, that they have different stuff in the vaccines, your material's gotten soft, Alex. I mean, this is mainstream media that they're picking up on this.
[2:10:32.560 --> 2:10:59.560]  I mean, I wanted to know something interesting. I looked at Fox News yesterday online, and they talked about the latest czar, Dr. John Holdren, who's a nasty, nasty person, and we're going to talk about him for a minute. He wants to push this vaccine in September, and he's the one who co-authored a book with Dr. Paul Ehrlich in the 70s about eugenics and everything.
[2:10:59.560 --> 2:11:15.560]  I mean, they openly said it, and he's the one who wants to push this, so they talked about how 90,000 people are going to die, 100 people commented, 95% have been listening to Alex Jones, or I thought they were.
[2:11:15.560 --> 2:11:27.560]  There's mercury, you shouldn't take the vaccine, there's squalene, you shouldn't take the vaccine, Dr. Tenton said you shouldn't take the vaccine. I thought I was looking at an alternative medicine blog, unbelievable.
[2:11:27.560 --> 2:11:35.560]  You're soft, Alex. You've got to get better material. You've got to make up some stuff. The New World Order, it's all real. It's frightening.
[2:11:35.560 --> 2:11:52.560]  Well, here's the issue, and you're right. Actually, a lot of conspiracy theorists do start getting into the Earth's hollow and have space aliens in it, and Alex Jones is a reptoid because all the mainline stuff has been admitted now, so it doesn't have that shock value.
[2:11:52.560 --> 2:12:02.560]  But no, I just go off the government documents, I go off of what I'm aware of. That's why now it's all mainstream news because they're carrying their program out.
[2:12:02.560 --> 2:12:09.560]  But because we planted all those seeds, and you and others valiantly did as well, now we're having a big effect, and you're right.
[2:12:09.560 --> 2:12:24.560]  I see articles about the government healthcare, the vaccines, message boards on mainline newspapers in Europe, in Texas, England, and you're right, 9 out of 10 or more.
[2:12:24.560 --> 2:12:31.560]  When you said 95%, that's more like it. And people can go see this for themselves. They're all awake. They know.
[2:12:31.560 --> 2:12:41.560]  And I think the eugenicists, just like with Hitler, you know, Hitler was a popular guy in 1936, 1937, 1938, Time Magazine, you know, great guy, eugenics is great.
[2:12:41.560 --> 2:12:48.560]  But as soon as you stand up to them, they collapse. And I think that's starting to happen. But go ahead.
[2:12:48.560 --> 2:13:01.560]  Paper tigers. Well, you know, I just had to add over something, you said 30% of doctors, that was the report out of England where they're about to do it, but said they will not administer or take this wine full vaccine.
[2:13:01.560 --> 2:13:12.560]  But even more, 35% more said they weren't sure, which means only about 25% said they would do it. Well, that's an F in every class I've been in.
[2:13:12.560 --> 2:13:20.560]  You know, I've been in a lot of classes in my life. You know, I think the public has gotten well informed. I think there's so much material.
[2:13:20.560 --> 2:13:30.560]  You have done, really, I want to commend you. You've done an incredible job. You have talked and talked until people say, hey, wait a minute, Alex may be telling us something that's real.
[2:13:30.560 --> 2:13:41.560]  You know, and so it's really exciting. You know, I'm really not that worried what's going to happen. I've told all my families, 50% of the families who come to this homeschool, their children, have a little bit of protection.
[2:13:41.560 --> 2:13:49.560]  I've told those who go to school, you may have to keep your children out of school. So what's the big deal? What's going to happen?
[2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:55.560]  They're going to end up at Harvard Yale because the kids don't go to school like that. They'll waste their time at school. The ones who end up at the top school.
[2:13:55.560 --> 2:14:07.560]  You know, but I think that they are so afraid. See, I tell you Alex, add conspiracy theory. The vaccine manufacturers know that the vaccine doesn't work.
[2:14:07.560 --> 2:14:16.560]  They know that. They absolutely know. It's never worked. You pointed it out. The swine flu in 76 didn't work. Every year the seasonal flu vaccine doesn't work.
[2:14:16.560 --> 2:14:30.560]  Well, sir, you're the medical doctor. So take your time. Go through that and then walk through these mercury and squalene adjuvants, what they're causing in the body as a top medical doctor. Break it down for us.
[2:14:30.560 --> 2:14:44.560]  Well, you know, let me give you what I think their game plan is. They weren't worried about giving this swine flu vaccine in September when they knew that swine flu wasn't going to be an issue.
[2:14:44.560 --> 2:14:49.560]  But now they're concerned it may be an issue and people may die from it. I mean, that's not even a question.
[2:14:49.560 --> 2:15:00.560]  So they can't, they couldn't give the vaccine in September. And then the majority of the flu season is between September and the end of October. That's when the people get sick and die.
[2:15:00.560 --> 2:15:11.560]  After that, it tends to be milder no matter what. They've got 50 years of history of this. And so they realize that when this may be real, if they gave the vaccine in September,
[2:15:11.560 --> 2:15:21.560]  inoculated 300 million people's country and 100,000 people died, their whole vaccine program with all the other childhood vaccines could go down the drain.
[2:15:21.560 --> 2:15:26.560]  So they took the vaccine that they had, they put it in the storage, they said, we can't come out with it until the end of October.
[2:15:26.560 --> 2:15:38.560]  Now, Dr. John Holdren, not an MD, not a medical doctor, but yet he's the director of the White House Office on Science and Technology Policy.
[2:15:38.560 --> 2:15:47.560]  And he said, no, it is so imperative that you have to water it down and give it in the middle of September. The drug companies now come back to him.
[2:15:47.560 --> 2:15:54.560]  Now, I'm making this up and say, oh, we're happy to give you water down because we'll tell you it most probably doesn't work. So now we're covered either way.
[2:15:54.560 --> 2:16:00.560]  We've made our money in September. And if it doesn't work, we say, you see, we have to wait until we have the right amount.
[2:16:00.560 --> 2:16:10.560]  And so that's the whole thing. All the other stuff, the mercury, the squalene, mercury is one of the most known toxins.
[2:16:10.560 --> 2:16:17.560]  And now they're trying to back off and pretend it's not in the vaccine. But it's not only Alex Jones or Sherry Tenpenny who's saying it.
[2:16:17.560 --> 2:16:25.560]  The Wall Street Journal ran the article. The New York Times ran the article, The Washington Post, or I like to call it The Washington Compost.
[2:16:25.560 --> 2:16:42.560]  You know, it's so out there. I think it becomes, Alex, one of these points where all these misinformed or non-thinkers go along, go along.
[2:16:42.560 --> 2:16:46.560]  They say, hey, wait a minute, I'm the next one to be put into the concentration camp.
[2:16:46.560 --> 2:16:55.560]  And I can tell you something came out this morning, which is great because I heard you mention Mike Adams, who's just fabulous.
[2:16:55.560 --> 2:17:03.560]  He came out with a video. Everyone's gone to YouTube. Look at his video. It says, don't inject me. It is just great.
[2:17:03.560 --> 2:17:11.560]  And I think now they're less worried about the damage they can cause with mercury and squalene, both toxic chemicals.
[2:17:11.560 --> 2:17:17.560]  Squalene has never been approved for use. And they're more worried that they could lose the whole program.
[2:17:17.560 --> 2:17:22.560]  What does it mean, the whole program? The polio, the DPT, the measles, most of the rebella?
[2:17:22.560 --> 2:17:26.560]  Because once people start doubting, all of a sudden the truth starts coming out.
[2:17:26.560 --> 2:17:32.560]  Well, sir, I know three years ago you looked at the trials. I covered it. I had other medical doctors on. I had families.
[2:17:32.560 --> 2:17:41.560]  Women whose children had died on the show just in the trials with the HPV shot, the human papilloma, Gardasil.
[2:17:41.560 --> 2:17:46.560]  And then now the FDA comes out last week and says, yeah, we may put a warning out on this.
[2:17:46.560 --> 2:17:56.560]  From your medical research, is it the virus or the adjunct or the thing that triggers the immune system?
[2:17:56.560 --> 2:17:59.560]  Why is that shot killing people?
[2:17:59.560 --> 2:18:08.560]  Well, you know, I think all of them are, but this one is more remarkable because you're dealing with teenage, young teenage girls.
[2:18:08.560 --> 2:18:15.560]  And so it becomes more dramatic. If a four-year-old or a five-year-old dies, they can attribute it to something else.
[2:18:15.560 --> 2:18:18.560]  You know, asthma, bronchitis, you know.
[2:18:18.560 --> 2:18:26.560]  But when a healthy, good-looking teenager who's a cheerleader who's 13, 14, or 15 years old, and those are the ones who have been dying
[2:18:26.560 --> 2:18:31.560]  because those are the ones who are getting the vaccines right now, you know, Stalin said it the best.
[2:18:31.560 --> 2:18:35.560]  The death of one person is a tragedy. The death of 10,000 is statistic.
[2:18:35.560 --> 2:18:41.560]  And I think we've finally taken you know what to do. You know, I don't know.
[2:18:41.560 --> 2:18:46.560]  You know, I don't know the answer except Dr. Mendelssohn, back in the 70s, just made the blanket statement
[2:18:46.560 --> 2:18:52.560]  after he was the National Medical Director of Head Start, which means he was the top pediatrician in the country
[2:18:52.560 --> 2:18:56.560]  when he came through the government program. He made the statement,
[2:18:56.560 --> 2:19:00.560]  every single vaccine causes neurological damage.
[2:19:00.560 --> 2:19:05.560]  And that was even before we knew about the mercury, before we knew about the aluminum.
[2:19:05.560 --> 2:19:12.560]  He just had this global vision of being involved and seeing what was happening.
[2:19:12.560 --> 2:19:15.560]  And I think that everyone's got a piece of the puzzle, Alex.
[2:19:15.560 --> 2:19:21.560]  And so to say it's only the mercury, only the squalene, or the aluminum, or the abortive fetal tissue, you know,
[2:19:21.560 --> 2:19:24.560]  or the neomycin, or streptomycin, which are all...
[2:19:24.560 --> 2:19:31.560]  So it's not just the adjuvants, it's the cocktail. I had Dr. Russell Blalock on last week, the procedures brain surgeon.
[2:19:31.560 --> 2:19:37.560]  He said that brains are looking different for people's ages. People don't have memory.
[2:19:37.560 --> 2:19:42.560]  That people are brain damaged. And I want to talk to you as a medical doctor when we come back about that.
[2:19:42.560 --> 2:19:48.560]  He said it's vaccines. It's the pesticides. It's the heavy metals in the foods.
[2:19:48.560 --> 2:19:52.560]  It's a cocktail. But what is different today than 30, 40 years ago?
[2:19:52.560 --> 2:19:56.560]  Dr. Mayor Eisenstein, prestigious doctor, huge practice.
[2:19:56.560 --> 2:20:19.560]  We'll talk about how the Amish don't get autism.
[2:20:27.560 --> 2:20:32.560]  Purchase precious metals, stock up on storeable foods, and support this show sponsors.

[2:21:00.560 --> 2:21:07.560]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:21:07.560 --> 2:21:11.560]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. Who is the enemy?
[2:21:11.560 --> 2:21:13.560]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[2:21:13.560 --> 2:21:16.560]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to the south of Bin Laden.
[2:21:16.560 --> 2:21:23.560]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:21:23.560 --> 2:21:30.560]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[2:21:30.560 --> 2:21:34.560]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:21:34.560 --> 2:21:41.560]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:21:41.560 --> 2:21:48.560]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com.

[2:22:00.560 --> 2:22:11.560]  Good day. Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources. August 28, 2009. Gold opened this morning at 9.54.70. A 1-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.81.95,
[2:22:11.560 --> 2:22:20.560]  $4.90.98 for a half ounce, and $2.45.49 for quarter ounce. That's $9.81.95, $4.90.98, and $2.45.49.
[2:22:20.560 --> 2:22:27.560]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit,
[2:22:27.560 --> 2:22:34.560]  then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[2:22:34.560 --> 2:22:37.560]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said,
[2:22:37.560 --> 2:22:43.560]  the central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people in a standing army?
[2:22:43.560 --> 2:22:48.560]  Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[2:22:48.560 --> 2:23:00.560]  Call for your copy, 1-800-686-2237. Isn't it time to understand the system? Call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.

[2:23:03.560 --> 2:23:07.560]  Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource on Earth,
[2:23:07.560 --> 2:23:10.560]  because it will provide healthy food now and every year after.
[2:23:10.560 --> 2:23:18.560]  Survivalistseeds.com now has the heirloom garden seed time capsule, allowing you to store your seeds for the future anywhere, even underground.

[2:24:19.560 --> 2:24:28.560]  I sleep good at night, ladies and gentlemen, because I know from not just the White House Science,
[2:24:28.560 --> 2:24:34.560]  or his own government policy book, Ecoscience, or from the United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment,
[2:24:34.560 --> 2:24:48.560]  $89.96 from the State Department of the Random 200, the Royal Commission on Population, $49 from the Minutes and Documents of the Carnegie and Ford Foundation that are public from even 80 years ago.
[2:24:48.560 --> 2:24:56.560]  It's just amazing stuff that it is eugenics, that it's cold-blooded, they see us as animals, and they're carrying this out.
[2:24:56.560 --> 2:25:05.560]  And I know these vaccines are killing people, but as Dr. Eisenstein just said, the little-known secret is that these vaccines don't work.
[2:25:05.560 --> 2:25:10.560]  Even if you believe they work, they never get the mutation right. Doc, you want to explain that to people?
[2:25:10.560 --> 2:25:18.560]  Well, it's not only the swine flu, because in 1976 we had the best experiment on vaccines ever.
[2:25:18.560 --> 2:25:29.560]  That was when Gerald Ford, President Gerald Ford, felt that we were going to have a swine flu epidemic and ordered the inoculation of every single American.
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:35.560]  Well, they got through about 15 or 20%, and this ran for about five or six weeks.
[2:25:35.560 --> 2:25:42.560]  And all of a sudden they realized they were people dying from the vaccine, but no one was dying from the swine flu.
[2:25:42.560 --> 2:25:48.560]  And so what they did is they immediately ended the program. They claimed only 40 or 50 people died.
[2:25:48.560 --> 2:25:56.560]  But, Alex, I can guarantee you, without knowing the actual data, if 40 or 50 people died, they wouldn't have stopped the program.
[2:25:56.560 --> 2:26:05.560]  My feeling is hundreds died, and they claimed there were 5,000 people who got a neurological disorder from the vaccine called Guillain-Barre,
[2:26:05.560 --> 2:26:12.560]  where you have temporary paralysis, but many times complete paralysis, which never recovers. They claimed 5,000.
[2:26:12.560 --> 2:26:19.560]  I believe it's got to be at least 50,000, because I know almost every doctor who knew one or two patients who had Guillain-Barre from the vaccine.
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:24.560]  It's not possible. 5,000 is a very, very small number, and they wouldn't have cut it out because of that.
[2:26:24.560 --> 2:26:35.560]  And there was a warning just now in England from the head of neurological services that they believe that this vaccine will also cause neurological damage.
[2:26:35.560 --> 2:26:37.560]  Hello? We've known this for 30 years.
[2:26:37.560 --> 2:26:43.560]  Well, yes, sir. And the doctor, being honest, was citing internal CDC reports, so they know.
[2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:51.560]  Right, exactly. And so we already know for 76 that this flu vaccine doesn't work, but it's more than just the flu vaccine.
[2:26:51.560 --> 2:26:58.560]  When you take a look, and no one's better than Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, I mean, she is just the best researcher I've ever my life met.
[2:26:58.560 --> 2:27:06.560]  I mean, she gets every, because she's so gentle-looking, Alex, that everyone is willing to give her the data thinking that she's not as radical as she is.
[2:27:06.560 --> 2:27:12.560]  And you take a look at her books, and you take a look at her writing, and you take a look at the data.
[2:27:12.560 --> 2:27:19.560]  And what is the data show? There is one disease that a vaccine has really caused to be eliminated.
[2:27:19.560 --> 2:27:24.560]  And you start with a disease that we don't have vaccines. It's tuberculosis. Why doesn't it exist today?
[2:27:24.560 --> 2:27:32.560]  Rocky Mountains feed us a fever, yellow fever, plague, cholera. We don't have vaccines for these.
[2:27:32.560 --> 2:27:37.560]  All these diseases were very rampant 100 years ago. They don't exist anymore.
[2:27:37.560 --> 2:27:44.560]  And then when you look at the charts, like polio, dipheria, tetanus, whooping cough, and you take a look,
[2:27:44.560 --> 2:27:51.560]  the disappearance of these diseases was almost, it just kept going from 80 years ago.
[2:27:51.560 --> 2:27:56.560]  There was a lot of these diseases, and now less and less. Then the vaccine comes in.
[2:27:56.560 --> 2:28:01.560]  The vaccine should change the curve that should drop right down. It doesn't. It continues at the same curve.
[2:28:01.560 --> 2:28:05.560]  So you take the tuberculosis curve, no vaccine. Overlay.
[2:28:05.560 --> 2:28:10.560]  Doctor, let me stop you because I'm aware of the Australian, US, British, Canadian data.
[2:28:10.560 --> 2:28:16.560]  Graphs can all be superimposed. I should even dig one up online and post it.
[2:28:16.560 --> 2:28:21.560]  Because of indoor plumbing, because of sanitation, because of better nutrition,
[2:28:21.560 --> 2:28:28.560]  you see starting 100 years ago a massive plunge in all these diseases.
[2:28:28.560 --> 2:28:35.560]  Then vaccines worldwide become popular and the diseases actually across the board start going back up,
[2:28:35.560 --> 2:28:38.560]  proving that these are hurting people's immune systems, causing problems.
[2:28:38.560 --> 2:28:42.560]  I'm not stealing your thunder. It's just you're moving quickly.
[2:28:42.560 --> 2:28:47.560]  It is conclusive, and that's why the eugenicists want to shoot you up.
[2:28:47.560 --> 2:28:53.560]  The evidence shows is because they believe they're naturally coming in to reapply diseases
[2:28:53.560 --> 2:28:58.560]  that hand-washing and better nutrition and running water have gotten rid of.
[2:28:58.560 --> 2:28:59.560]  Go ahead, sir.
[2:28:59.560 --> 2:29:03.560]  Let me see. You are 100% right, but here's what's happened.
[2:29:03.560 --> 2:29:07.560]  There's not a lot of treatment for many of these diseases we mentioned.
[2:29:07.560 --> 2:29:09.560]  They have to come up with a real scheme.
[2:29:09.560 --> 2:29:15.560]  That is, how do we create chronic illness, arthritis, cancer, heart disease,
[2:29:15.560 --> 2:29:21.560]  where people will live for a substantial amount of time and take drugs for the rest of their life?
[2:29:21.560 --> 2:29:25.560]  That's what we thought we've replaced infectious disease with chronic illness.
[2:29:25.560 --> 2:29:30.560]  I'm convinced the vaccines are the number one cause of our chronic illness.
[2:29:30.560 --> 2:29:34.560]  By the way, you said that in books years ago and on the show.
[2:29:34.560 --> 2:29:38.560]  Now we have mainstream news reporting in laboratory tests
[2:29:38.560 --> 2:29:44.560]  that it's giving the rats they give the vaccines to chronic, hardcore, arthritis.
[2:29:44.560 --> 2:30:06.560]  We'll be right back and talk about that with Dr. Eisenstein.
[2:30:15.560 --> 2:30:16.560]  It's true.
[2:30:16.560 --> 2:30:20.560]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:30:20.560 --> 2:30:21.560]  Number three.
[2:30:21.560 --> 2:30:24.560]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[2:30:24.560 --> 2:30:27.560]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[2:30:27.560 --> 2:30:28.560]  Number four.
[2:30:28.560 --> 2:30:30.560]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[2:30:30.560 --> 2:30:34.560]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[2:30:34.560 --> 2:30:35.560]  Number five.
[2:30:35.560 --> 2:30:39.560]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:30:39.560 --> 2:30:43.560]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:30:43.560 --> 2:30:45.560]  a longtime sponsor of ours.

[2:31:00.560 --> 2:31:03.560]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[2:31:03.560 --> 2:31:07.560]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm,
[2:31:07.560 --> 2:31:09.560]  how much ammunition do you want?
[2:31:09.560 --> 2:31:11.560]  My answer would be all I can get.
[2:31:11.560 --> 2:31:14.560]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[2:31:14.560 --> 2:31:16.560]  Food is your only ammunition.
[2:31:16.560 --> 2:31:17.560]  How much do you want?
[2:31:17.560 --> 2:31:18.560]  When do you want it?
[2:31:18.560 --> 2:31:20.560]  Now or after the battle starts.
[2:31:20.560 --> 2:31:21.560]  When will you need it?
[2:31:21.560 --> 2:31:23.560]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[2:31:23.560 --> 2:31:25.560]  Will there be any food?
[2:31:25.560 --> 2:31:26.560]  Will it make your children sick?
[2:31:26.560 --> 2:31:29.560]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[2:31:29.560 --> 2:31:31.560]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[2:31:31.560 --> 2:31:35.560]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:31:35.560 --> 2:31:39.560]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[2:31:39.560 --> 2:31:40.560]  How much will you need?
[2:31:40.560 --> 2:31:41.560]  We don't know.
[2:31:41.560 --> 2:31:42.560]  How much do you want?
[2:31:42.560 --> 2:31:43.560]  All you can get.
[2:31:43.560 --> 2:31:44.560]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:31:44.560 --> 2:31:47.560]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[2:31:47.560 --> 2:31:55.560]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:31:55.560 --> 2:32:21.560]  Again, that number is 1-800-409-5633.
[2:32:21.560 --> 2:32:28.560]  Call 1-800-691-6043 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:32:51.560 --> 2:32:57.560]  Or visit a cola blue on the web at www.e-c-o-l-o-b-l-u-e.com today.
[2:32:57.560 --> 2:33:22.560]  That's a cola blue dot com.
[2:33:22.560 --> 2:33:32.560]  Well, we just haven't had the world premiere today of the new trailer for Fall of the Republic.
[2:33:32.560 --> 2:33:37.560]  Burmos is making a film called Invisible Empire.
[2:33:37.560 --> 2:33:39.560]  And it's amazing research.
[2:33:39.560 --> 2:33:41.560]  You've been working on this thing for years.
[2:33:41.560 --> 2:33:43.560]  It's coming out early next year.
[2:33:43.560 --> 2:33:45.560]  They're going to have the world premiere of that.
[2:33:45.560 --> 2:33:47.560]  It's not even on YouTube yet.
[2:33:47.560 --> 2:33:51.560]  Coming up next hour here on air at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:33:51.560 --> 2:33:55.560]  If you're a member, you'll be able to see the video here for the first time.
[2:33:55.560 --> 2:33:57.560]  If you're a prisonplanet.tv member.
[2:33:57.560 --> 2:34:00.560]  But if you're not, you'll be able to hear obviously the audio from it.
[2:34:00.560 --> 2:34:03.560]  And then coming up later this evening, you're going to have an article Burmos wrote
[2:34:03.560 --> 2:34:06.560]  and the trailer at the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[2:34:06.560 --> 2:34:08.560]  It will be up in the next two hours or so.
[2:34:08.560 --> 2:34:13.560]  But world premiere coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[2:34:13.560 --> 2:34:18.560]  So exactly one hour from now, or 59 minutes if you want to get technical.
[2:34:18.560 --> 2:34:19.560]  We'll play that here.
[2:34:19.560 --> 2:34:21.560]  Got a bunch of other news I want to go over.
[2:34:21.560 --> 2:34:24.560]  I know we have Donna and Bill and Gene and Pat.
[2:34:24.560 --> 2:34:26.560]  And I don't want to hang up on these callers.
[2:34:26.560 --> 2:34:30.560]  But you were here before we got Dr. Eisenstein on.
[2:34:30.560 --> 2:34:34.560]  You can either change your question to him about the flu or the new world order or eugenics
[2:34:34.560 --> 2:34:36.560]  or call back another day.
[2:34:36.560 --> 2:34:41.560]  I'm going to give the number out 1-800-259-9231.
[2:34:41.560 --> 2:34:43.560]  Now, doctor, you're a humble guy.
[2:34:43.560 --> 2:34:48.560]  You're one of the leading experts on this because the government likes to cover up their own studies,
[2:34:48.560 --> 2:34:52.560]  their own test, big pharma does or take the aspartame trials.
[2:34:52.560 --> 2:34:55.560]  It killed almost all the resus monkeys that they gave it to.
[2:34:55.560 --> 2:35:00.560]  But then they use that data by removing the dead monkeys to say get it approved.
[2:35:00.560 --> 2:35:01.560]  They play all sorts of games.
[2:35:01.560 --> 2:35:05.560]  You're a leading expert because you have one of the biggest practices in the country.
[2:35:05.560 --> 2:35:08.560]  I mean, you're quite the productive person.
[2:35:08.560 --> 2:35:14.560]  Not just, you know, do you have a medical examiner's license or are you a lawyer or multiple medical degrees?
[2:35:14.560 --> 2:35:19.560]  You've got a huge, huge practice of homeschoolers, regular folks.
[2:35:19.560 --> 2:35:23.560]  And then you also watch the Amish and know them.
[2:35:23.560 --> 2:35:28.560]  Tell folks, well, finish your point about how the vaccines don't work.
[2:35:28.560 --> 2:35:36.560]  And then let's get into just the evidence right there that you see public schools where some schools,
[2:35:36.560 --> 2:35:39.560]  a third of the school have got neurological disorders,
[2:35:39.560 --> 2:35:44.560]  supposedly or their brains have been rotted by the vaccines and other chemicals.
[2:35:44.560 --> 2:35:47.560]  Then meanwhile, the Amish, you don't ever see that.
[2:35:47.560 --> 2:35:49.560]  You don't see autism.
[2:35:49.560 --> 2:35:50.560]  That's exactly right.
[2:35:50.560 --> 2:35:54.560]  I didn't even really know that one way or the other until Dan Olstead,
[2:35:54.560 --> 2:36:00.560]  who was at the time a senior medical writer for United Press Internationally came to Chicago,
[2:36:00.560 --> 2:36:02.560]  to be heard about our practice.
[2:36:02.560 --> 2:36:04.560]  Now, I want to know Alex, it's not only me.
[2:36:04.560 --> 2:36:10.560]  It's Dr. Rosie, Dr. Shantower, Dr. Zumhegan, and 20 other doctors who have worked with me over the last 30-plus years.
[2:36:10.560 --> 2:36:15.560]  And we've always had a practice that gave vaccine choice to families.
[2:36:15.560 --> 2:36:19.560]  And you asked earlier, what's the difference from 35 years ago?
[2:36:19.560 --> 2:36:24.560]  Well, 35 years ago, they didn't give 58 vaccines to children the first couple of years of life.
[2:36:24.560 --> 2:36:28.560]  We gave 10 or 12, still most probably problematic.
[2:36:28.560 --> 2:36:31.560]  But the problem was, the fraction was today.
[2:36:31.560 --> 2:36:35.560]  So, Dan Olstead comes to Chicago, he spends time with our practice,
[2:36:35.560 --> 2:36:40.560]  and talks to all the doctors, and he said, you know, where is the autism?
[2:36:40.560 --> 2:36:41.560]  Show me the autism.
[2:36:41.560 --> 2:36:44.560]  I said, you know, I want to know, Alex, I barely knew what autism was.
[2:36:44.560 --> 2:36:47.560]  I'd read about it in the textbooks, but that was about it.
[2:36:47.560 --> 2:36:49.560]  Never saw a case, you know.
[2:36:49.560 --> 2:36:51.560]  And we have been delivering babies at home.
[2:36:51.560 --> 2:36:52.560]  That's mainly what we've done.
[2:36:52.560 --> 2:36:53.560]  They'll still continue to do it.
[2:36:53.560 --> 2:36:57.560]  And we're close to 20,000 babies along the way that we've delivered at home.
[2:36:57.560 --> 2:37:03.560]  But here's the shift in our practice, in the last 10 or 15 years that I've become more and more vocal about vaccines.
[2:37:03.560 --> 2:37:10.560]  Our vaccine rates have gone from 10% of the practice to 9% to 5%, where now it's almost non-existent.
[2:37:10.560 --> 2:37:14.560]  The only reason we don't become a vaccine-free practice,
[2:37:14.560 --> 2:37:17.560]  is because my partners have been with me for more than 25 years,
[2:37:17.560 --> 2:37:20.560]  who've never vaccinated their children, said to me,
[2:37:20.560 --> 2:37:27.560]  if we give such a hard line, we're going to lose thousands of people when they come, realize that they don't have to vaccinate their children.
[2:37:27.560 --> 2:37:30.560]  It also became obvious that it's more than just autism.
[2:37:30.560 --> 2:37:36.560]  We have virtually no asthma, virtually no diabetes, virtually no allergies.
[2:37:36.560 --> 2:37:40.560]  You know, all these chronic conditions that children today suffer from.
[2:37:40.560 --> 2:37:44.560]  And those people will say, oh, there's no real increase in autism.
[2:37:44.560 --> 2:37:47.560]  We're just counting different.
[2:37:47.560 --> 2:37:53.560]  Well, how do you count all you said so well, the neurological problems in school?
[2:37:53.560 --> 2:37:55.560]  Look, I'm going to stop you right there.
[2:37:55.560 --> 2:38:02.560]  I don't need to be a rocket scientist to know that when I went to see movies like Dumbo when I was a kid,
[2:38:02.560 --> 2:38:08.560]  or I went to take my sister who's 14 years younger than me, you know, when I was in high school and college,
[2:38:08.560 --> 2:38:13.560]  I'd take her, my parents would say, will you come over and babysit next week and take her to a movie?
[2:38:13.560 --> 2:38:18.560]  You never saw autistic children. I'm on the green belt. I'm at the mall.
[2:38:18.560 --> 2:38:26.560]  I take my kids every few months to a movie. It's like two or three rows are in there autistic.
[2:38:26.560 --> 2:38:31.560]  I mean, they are dead. The schools and people say, oh, well, that's just false diagnosis.
[2:38:31.560 --> 2:38:36.560]  It's not false diagnosis when you're on the green belt and there's autistic kids running around screaming everywhere,
[2:38:36.560 --> 2:38:38.560]  completely out of their minds.
[2:38:38.560 --> 2:38:44.560]  I mean, they, but they're under chemical attack and we've seen autism rates go from what, 1 in 25,000,
[2:38:44.560 --> 2:38:49.560]  27 years ago to 1 in 86 now, the Fed's own numbers. I mean, boy.
[2:38:49.560 --> 2:38:55.560]  And that's the most severe case. All this has to be looked at as the same thing with Dr. Melsen said 30 years ago.
[2:38:55.560 --> 2:39:00.560]  What's the difference in ADD, ADHD and autism? Just the spectrum.
[2:39:00.560 --> 2:39:06.560]  You know, how severely your brain has been damaged like Dr. Blalock said, you know, and that's the only difference.
[2:39:06.560 --> 2:39:11.560]  And we saw virtually none of this, but even more impressive may have been when Blue Cross called me,
[2:39:11.560 --> 2:39:18.560]  this is about two or three years ago, and they said to me, because we also have a small HMO group that were part of Blue Cross.
[2:39:18.560 --> 2:39:23.560]  And they said the asthma rate in their network was 12%.
[2:39:23.560 --> 2:39:29.560]  We had one child out of a thousand with asthma, you know, and they have a great definition.
[2:39:29.560 --> 2:39:34.560]  Two emerge to your business in one year for any respiratory illness or one hospitalization.
[2:39:34.560 --> 2:39:37.560]  So you can't say one person doing one thing, one person doing another thing.
[2:39:37.560 --> 2:39:41.560]  And they wanted to know, Alex, you have to hear this, this is very fascinating.
[2:39:41.560 --> 2:39:46.560]  So I go to the meeting there at Blue Cross and they said to me, Doc, why do you have such low rates?
[2:39:46.560 --> 2:39:50.560]  I said, well, we're the best doctors in the world. Just come on, tell us the truth.
[2:39:50.560 --> 2:39:52.560]  So I said, why don't you tell me what you think?
[2:39:52.560 --> 2:39:55.560]  Because they have all the records there for all the HMO patients.
[2:39:55.560 --> 2:39:58.560]  None of these children are vaccinated. How incredible.
[2:39:58.560 --> 2:40:05.560]  That was frightening. That's when I realized that Alex Jones not only is right, not only has had an impact on the country, you know,
[2:40:05.560 --> 2:40:10.560]  but this is not conspiracy theory. This is overt now.
[2:40:10.560 --> 2:40:17.560]  Well, that's what's crazy about this. Why would these corporate minions who aren't part of that upper crust of eugenicists,
[2:40:17.560 --> 2:40:23.560]  why would anybody want to do this? I mean, I've been on vacation, I've been at the mall,
[2:40:23.560 --> 2:40:28.560]  I've been at the grocery store and you'll see an autistic child, you know, 10 years old and diapers.
[2:40:28.560 --> 2:40:35.560]  And I'm not obnoxious about it. I want to know. And I walk over and I say, when did your child become autistic?
[2:40:35.560 --> 2:40:40.560]  And they always say, 18 months old, third round of shots.
[2:40:40.560 --> 2:40:47.560]  He was running around talking, singing. Now he, now he does this and the child's.
[2:40:47.560 --> 2:40:53.560]  And I mean, it's, it's, and then I read about how when your kid has the convulsion that night,
[2:40:53.560 --> 2:40:59.560]  they didn't send the police to arrest you because they do a CAT scan and see the brain swelling and say you shook your kid's head.
[2:40:59.560 --> 2:41:06.560]  When you're a medical doctor and have countless others on, clearly they know the mercury and the squalene is,
[2:41:06.560 --> 2:41:09.560]  is causing an autoimmune response and making the brain swell.
[2:41:09.560 --> 2:41:15.560]  So then they don't just brain damage your kid with a chemical lobotomy. Now they're going to arrest you for it too.
[2:41:15.560 --> 2:41:19.560]  Well, you know, let me tell you, do you think everyone in Germany were Nazis?
[2:41:19.560 --> 2:41:25.560]  Everyone of the people, everyone of the Germans. But you know, there's a point that the more so-called,
[2:41:25.560 --> 2:41:30.560]  quote, intellectual as society becomes, and I put that word in quotes, not smart, you know,
[2:41:30.560 --> 2:41:36.560]  they all of a sudden defer to the experts, defer to the experts and they stop thinking and the brain goes soft.
[2:41:36.560 --> 2:41:41.560]  And all of a sudden you, you, you, you can't imagine that all these experts are wrong.
[2:41:41.560 --> 2:41:45.560]  You know, and it doesn't take very many. And that's what you said. They're a paper tiger.
[2:41:45.560 --> 2:41:51.560]  They're a blessed paper tiger. And I think what's happening now, just like at the town hall meetings,
[2:41:51.560 --> 2:41:56.560]  Alex Jones hired and spent money to hire all these people to go to the town hall meeting.
[2:41:56.560 --> 2:42:02.560]  I don't think so. You didn't hire the 80-year-old woman who was in a wheelchair who's screaming how ridiculous this is
[2:42:02.560 --> 2:42:07.560]  and they're calling her a hoodlum, you know. And so it's all the same, you know, but it's not working anymore.
[2:42:07.560 --> 2:42:12.560]  And that's the problem. All of a sudden it's not working. They no longer can just say it and that's true.
[2:42:12.560 --> 2:42:18.560]  Chicago politics at its best. Just saying enough, say the lie enough times and people will believe it.
[2:42:18.560 --> 2:42:26.560]  I mean, I think that it's just so out of control. And I wanted to know that autism, of all the things in my 30-plus years in medicine,
[2:42:26.560 --> 2:42:33.560]  I've never seen anything as devastating to a family. Cancer, nothing compared to it. Heart disease, nothing.
[2:42:33.560 --> 2:42:39.560]  Those children are alive. They just have a short life. Autism, the parents have no life, no life.
[2:42:39.560 --> 2:42:43.560]  And these are the most brave parents in the world who take care of these children.
[2:42:43.560 --> 2:42:48.560]  You know, something I was at a conference in California last week, an autism conference.
[2:42:48.560 --> 2:42:54.560]  And I realized something I hadn't realized before. I'd never met both a husband and a wife together
[2:42:54.560 --> 2:42:59.560]  because one of us was always at home taking care of their child. How sad is that?
[2:42:59.560 --> 2:43:05.560]  You can't administer, hand over the care of somebody else. That's how difficult it is.
[2:43:05.560 --> 2:43:11.560]  Well, the child is in a prison and the parents are in a prison and it doesn't have to be this way.
[2:43:11.560 --> 2:43:18.560]  But then on top of it, but going back to the Amish, I mean, you're right, this has been even picked up in national news
[2:43:18.560 --> 2:43:23.560]  that you don't have these autistic children with the Amish. You don't have these high rates of cancer.
[2:43:23.560 --> 2:43:30.560]  You don't have these rates of the asthma from your medical research and the other research you've gone over.
[2:43:30.560 --> 2:43:36.560]  What is it doing? I mean, from the other doctors we've had on and endocrinologists and epidemiologists
[2:43:36.560 --> 2:43:44.560]  and brain surgeons, neurologists, they basically say that what's in the vaccines causes all sorts of inflammation
[2:43:44.560 --> 2:43:50.560]  and damage and burnout of the pancreas, burnout of different glands,
[2:43:50.560 --> 2:43:57.560]  all sorts of just total disruption in the body. I mean, is that, I know that's an oversimplification.
[2:43:57.560 --> 2:44:02.560]  That's an oversimplification. I go back to, yeah, I'm kind of an old time general practitioner.
[2:44:02.560 --> 2:44:05.560]  That's what I'm like, you know, and I'm pretty good as my wife says it.
[2:44:05.560 --> 2:44:07.560]  When I hear the truth, I seem to have to know it.
[2:44:07.560 --> 2:44:13.560]  When Dr. Mendelssohn said it over 30 years ago, every vaccine causes neurological damage
[2:44:13.560 --> 2:44:17.560]  and then you've got the brilliant people like Dr. Blalock and Dr. Boyd Haley,
[2:44:17.560 --> 2:44:21.560]  who now give you the reason why it's causing it. We see it.
[2:44:21.560 --> 2:44:26.560]  Every Alex Jones, and there aren't very many of you, who goes from the mall, sees it.
[2:44:26.560 --> 2:44:28.560]  All they're doing is giving you why it's happened.
[2:44:28.560 --> 2:44:33.560]  You know, I have made a statement, Alex, now for more than three years.
[2:44:33.560 --> 2:44:37.560]  There is no autism in our brain. I use the word virtually because I don't know every single family.
[2:44:37.560 --> 2:44:40.560]  I mean, everyone, some may have left me and moved to California.
[2:44:40.560 --> 2:44:46.560]  I've yet to get one letter. And boy, do I get a lot of hate emails at times.
[2:44:46.560 --> 2:44:50.560]  You know, when I talked about Obamacare, it's not for this doctor.
[2:44:50.560 --> 2:44:55.560]  My God, I got people sending me back emails. You better apologize.
[2:44:55.560 --> 2:44:58.560]  He's our president. He's not my president. I didn't vote for him.
[2:44:58.560 --> 2:45:01.560]  Oh, yeah, they love it. They love to now say you can't even criticize him.
[2:45:01.560 --> 2:45:02.560]  Right.
[2:45:02.560 --> 2:45:04.560]  Well, I mean, the issue is I've read over the three different bills.
[2:45:04.560 --> 2:45:07.560]  And everything people say is in there, is in there and more.
[2:45:07.560 --> 2:45:10.560]  And we've shown the subsections and they use this big lie.
[2:45:10.560 --> 2:45:13.560]  Like they say, we haven't introduced any anti-gun bills.
[2:45:13.560 --> 2:45:15.560]  They've introduced all these horrible ones. We've listed them.
[2:45:15.560 --> 2:45:20.560]  They say, oh, that's not in there. And then, you know, all this government control,
[2:45:20.560 --> 2:45:23.560]  all this rationing of care, that's the European model.
[2:45:23.560 --> 2:45:27.560]  We know, but also forcing more vaccines, more drugs.
[2:45:27.560 --> 2:45:31.560]  We know that that's all in there, but I also watch CNN and these other channels.
[2:45:31.560 --> 2:45:35.560]  They keep showing, I just am broke and I don't have money for my illness.
[2:45:35.560 --> 2:45:40.560]  And I need the free healthcare. They don't explain that it's only going to bankrupt things more
[2:45:40.560 --> 2:45:44.560]  and that government isn't going to give you that healthcare.
[2:45:44.560 --> 2:45:48.560]  They're going to take money out of your paycheck and then give you an aspirin for a heart attack.
[2:45:48.560 --> 2:45:52.560]  I mean, but again, they're selling, feel sorry for me.
[2:45:52.560 --> 2:45:56.560]  You'll be nice Americans, give in to big government again.
[2:45:56.560 --> 2:45:58.560]  And people are wise now.
[2:45:58.560 --> 2:46:01.560]  They don't, when somebody beats them over the head and says, you're a racist.
[2:46:01.560 --> 2:46:04.560]  If you don't do what we say, you don't care about sick people.
[2:46:04.560 --> 2:46:07.560]  If you don't do what we say, people see right through that.
[2:46:07.560 --> 2:46:10.560]  It's the most gracious country in the world. God bless America.
[2:46:10.560 --> 2:46:12.560]  My father came from Poland.
[2:46:12.560 --> 2:46:16.560]  He lived in Russia. He was a rabbi. He was a good businessman, came to America.
[2:46:16.560 --> 2:46:20.560]  My dad spoke nine languages and he said, he's traveled the whole world.
[2:46:20.560 --> 2:46:25.560]  When he came to America, I was a year old when he came to America, he was after the war.
[2:46:25.560 --> 2:46:29.560]  And every morning he got up and said, God bless America.
[2:46:29.560 --> 2:46:33.560]  There is no country more gracious that will take care of people.
[2:46:33.560 --> 2:46:36.560]  Everyone's taken care of in this country, Mr. President.
[2:46:36.560 --> 2:46:39.560]  You don't know what the blessed heck you're talking about.
[2:46:39.560 --> 2:46:44.560]  If you got forbid, you know, have an interview, go to any emergency room, they take care of you.
[2:46:44.560 --> 2:46:48.560]  If that bill isn't passed on to someone else, the doctor in the hospital will take care of you.
[2:46:48.560 --> 2:46:49.560]  They don't get paid.
[2:46:49.560 --> 2:46:54.560]  Exactly. My dad's a physician and he says they were taught in medical school, they were taught,
[2:46:54.560 --> 2:46:58.560]  that's what you do, that about 20, 30% of your practice is supposed to be free.
[2:46:58.560 --> 2:46:59.560]  Exactly.
[2:46:59.560 --> 2:47:05.560]  And then now, under this Obamacare, it actually takes that liability off the hospitals, off the doctors,
[2:47:05.560 --> 2:47:09.560]  and off the insurance companies, and then you get government care.
[2:47:09.560 --> 2:47:15.560]  The government says they can't even read the 1300 page bill, but they're going to now practice medicine.
[2:47:15.560 --> 2:47:21.560]  And then Obama gives these speeches where he says what test you need and he's now Dr. Obama.
[2:47:21.560 --> 2:47:23.560]  Yeah, I know. Let me tell you something.
[2:47:23.560 --> 2:47:29.560]  There are a couple of doctors in Congress and in the Senate and every one of them is against this.
[2:47:29.560 --> 2:47:35.560]  A Republican or Democrat, I find that very fascinating.
[2:47:35.560 --> 2:47:39.560]  But I think you're right, Alex, I think they're seeing through it.
[2:47:39.560 --> 2:47:41.560]  And so your message is coming through it.
[2:47:41.560 --> 2:47:43.560]  Really, God bless you, what you've been doing.
[2:47:43.560 --> 2:47:50.560]  It's been just incredible because who would have thought that two or three years ago?
[2:47:50.560 --> 2:47:51.560]  It's just absolutely amazing.
[2:47:51.560 --> 2:47:54.560]  But going back to the vaccine issues, what can we do?
[2:47:54.560 --> 2:47:58.560]  Because we don't have to bury our head in the sand right now.
[2:47:58.560 --> 2:48:00.560]  There are some very simple, simple treatments.
[2:48:00.560 --> 2:48:02.560]  Just washing your hands is nonsense.
[2:48:02.560 --> 2:48:04.560]  What are you supposed to tell?
[2:48:04.560 --> 2:48:06.560]  Don't kiss anyone. Don't shake your hand.
[2:48:06.560 --> 2:48:10.560]  Wash your hands. This is nonsense.
[2:48:10.560 --> 2:48:16.560]  Because it's clearly good hygiene before you sit down to eat to wash your hands.
[2:48:16.560 --> 2:48:20.560]  But this business, what they're talking about is image without substance.
[2:48:20.560 --> 2:48:24.560]  And I can tell you that there's enough evidence that vitamin D has made a difference.
[2:48:24.560 --> 2:48:30.560]  We looked at the 1918 Spanish flu and the most interesting thing were the sailors.
[2:48:30.560 --> 2:48:32.560]  We were warm, remember, 1918.
[2:48:32.560 --> 2:48:36.560]  The sailors on the ship had the lowest mortality from the Spanish flu.
[2:48:36.560 --> 2:48:42.560]  The soldiers in the barracks and in the foxholes had the highest mortality.
[2:48:42.560 --> 2:48:44.560]  So we need sunshine.
[2:48:44.560 --> 2:48:46.560]  Say again?
[2:48:46.560 --> 2:48:48.560]  We need to get more sun.
[2:48:48.560 --> 2:48:50.560]  More sun. More sun.
[2:48:50.560 --> 2:48:52.560]  And if not, you get a little bit of vitamin D.
[2:48:52.560 --> 2:48:54.560]  I mean, it's inexpensive. It's cheap.
[2:48:54.560 --> 2:48:56.560]  No one can make a big living selling it.
[2:48:56.560 --> 2:48:58.560]  You want your vitamin D.
[2:48:58.560 --> 2:49:00.560]  You want to get your vitamin D level.
[2:49:00.560 --> 2:49:02.560]  And of course, that's the old wives tale.
[2:49:02.560 --> 2:49:04.560]  You need to get more sun or you're going to get sick.
[2:49:04.560 --> 2:49:06.560]  You need to get outside.
[2:49:06.560 --> 2:49:08.560]  Right. My grandmother used to tell me, Alex,
[2:49:08.560 --> 2:49:10.560]  when I'd be sitting with a nice husband,
[2:49:10.560 --> 2:49:12.560]  what are you doing in the house? It's beautiful. Get outside.
[2:49:12.560 --> 2:49:14.560]  Get over the sun.
[2:49:14.560 --> 2:49:16.560]  I want to know how powerful this message is.
[2:49:16.560 --> 2:49:21.560]  This has been 35 years of deception by the American Academy of Dermatology.
[2:49:21.560 --> 2:49:23.560]  They think the sun will give you skin cancer.
[2:49:23.560 --> 2:49:25.560]  Well, that's true.
[2:49:25.560 --> 2:49:28.560]  How can we have more skin cancer now than ever?
[2:49:28.560 --> 2:49:30.560]  And no one's in the sun.
[2:49:30.560 --> 2:49:32.560]  Well, I'll tell you why. Just what you said.
[2:49:32.560 --> 2:49:34.560]  Sunscreen. They've got chemicals and poisons.
[2:49:34.560 --> 2:49:36.560]  They're just as bad as the vaccine.
[2:49:36.560 --> 2:49:38.560]  No one should be taking sunscreen.
[2:49:38.560 --> 2:49:40.560]  You know, I mean, it's unbelievable.
[2:49:40.560 --> 2:49:42.560]  It's almost pure aluminum.
[2:49:42.560 --> 2:49:44.560]  It's incredible.
[2:49:44.560 --> 2:49:46.560]  We're meant to get sun.
[2:49:46.560 --> 2:49:48.560]  It's what our whole body drives on.
[2:49:48.560 --> 2:49:50.560]  All the studies in Northern Europe with the highest rates of suicide.
[2:49:50.560 --> 2:49:55.560]  By law, they stick sun lamps in. Suicide rate plunges.
[2:49:55.560 --> 2:49:58.560]  Because our eyes are meant to get sun.
[2:49:58.560 --> 2:50:00.560]  We are meant to get sun.
[2:50:00.560 --> 2:50:03.560]  And yes, we're meant for our skin to get spots on it and get old.
[2:50:03.560 --> 2:50:05.560]  I mean, this is what we're designed.
[2:50:05.560 --> 2:50:07.560]  We live on a planet.
[2:50:07.560 --> 2:50:09.560]  Northern Europeans have white skin, so they get more.
[2:50:09.560 --> 2:50:11.560]  Because you have less sun in the north.
[2:50:11.560 --> 2:50:15.560]  You want the sun. You need the sun. It's good.
[2:50:15.560 --> 2:50:18.560]  That's right, you know.
[2:50:18.560 --> 2:50:21.560]  And I'm giving a paper in December.
[2:50:21.560 --> 2:50:24.560]  I'm presenting a paper at the American Academy of Anti-Aging.
[2:50:24.560 --> 2:50:28.560]  And the topic is low vitamin D levels.
[2:50:28.560 --> 2:50:30.560]  The root cause of cancer.
[2:50:30.560 --> 2:50:32.560]  There's enough evidence that's most probably true.
[2:50:32.560 --> 2:50:34.560]  No longer conspiracy theory.
[2:50:34.560 --> 2:50:36.560]  Already people are believing it.
[2:50:36.560 --> 2:50:38.560]  Well, imagine the conspiracy theory.
[2:50:38.560 --> 2:50:40.560]  It's like when I see ads for grass-fed beef.
[2:50:40.560 --> 2:50:44.560]  It's like bizarre to feed cows grass instead of dead cows.
[2:50:44.560 --> 2:50:47.560]  And it's bizarre to go, oh, we're supposed to get sun.
[2:50:47.560 --> 2:50:50.560]  Or, wow, global warming is good.
[2:50:50.560 --> 2:50:53.560]  It's caused by the sun. The sun, imagine it.
[2:50:53.560 --> 2:50:55.560]  It's the source of life.
[2:50:55.560 --> 2:50:57.560]  Doctor, stay there. Incredible info.
[2:50:57.560 --> 2:51:21.560]  Let's take calls straight ahead.
[2:51:27.560 --> 2:51:56.560]  Call 406-251-327-0.
[2:51:56.560 --> 2:52:01.560]  That's 406-251-3270 today.
[2:52:01.560 --> 2:52:03.560]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[2:52:03.560 --> 2:52:06.560]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[2:52:06.560 --> 2:52:09.560]  But in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope.
[2:52:09.560 --> 2:52:12.560]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:52:12.560 --> 2:52:18.560]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[2:52:18.560 --> 2:52:22.560]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:52:22.560 --> 2:52:27.560]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[2:52:27.560 --> 2:52:30.560]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[2:53:01.560 --> 2:53:08.560]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the US and the world.
[2:53:08.560 --> 2:53:12.560]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[2:53:12.560 --> 2:53:18.560]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[2:53:18.560 --> 2:53:23.560]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.

[2:54:00.560 --> 2:54:12.560]  Well, I'm really honored to have Dr. Eisenstein with us a little bit in the next hour.
[2:54:12.560 --> 2:54:17.560]  We've got the world premiere of Marmos's new film, the trailer of that as well.
[2:54:17.560 --> 2:54:20.560]  I meant to have our first trailer out weeks ago, and I got behind.
[2:54:20.560 --> 2:54:25.560]  And so we're just releasing these both at the same time, so that's always exciting and interesting.
[2:54:25.560 --> 2:54:30.560]  It's not anywhere yet. It'll air here first at presentplanet.tv as we sound on Castle Radio.
[2:54:30.560 --> 2:54:35.560]  Dr. Eisenstein, there's so many other points. What do you see happening then?
[2:54:35.560 --> 2:54:42.560]  Because I agree with you, and this is all a fluid situation, that so much came out on Gardasil killing people.
[2:54:42.560 --> 2:54:52.560]  So much has come out on autism that they're now trying this big flu hysteria as a cover for federal and UN control under level six.
[2:54:52.560 --> 2:54:55.560]  And that's congressmen are saying this now too.
[2:54:55.560 --> 2:55:01.560]  Exactly. I think you're right on point. I mean, you're right on point. It's not even theory anymore. It's reality.
[2:55:01.560 --> 2:55:07.560]  So really, they're playing the game from 20 years ago, but you and I and many others have woken folks up.
[2:55:07.560 --> 2:55:14.560]  The great listeners out there have. And so now, I saw them go from saying they had 195 million dosages to 40 million dosages.
[2:55:14.560 --> 2:55:20.560]  And I'm not saying we've had victory because they may keep going, but it does look like we're seeing them start to pull back.
[2:55:20.560 --> 2:55:29.560]  I think there's no question about it. And so they're applying as much care tactic as possible. 90,000 will die.
[2:55:29.560 --> 2:55:35.560]  That's possible. It's possible 90,000 will die. I don't think it's out of the question.
[2:55:35.560 --> 2:55:40.560]  But once again, the answer isn't going to be the...
[2:55:40.560 --> 2:55:44.560]  It's just like Gardasil. Let's go back here for a minute. This is a serious problem.
[2:55:44.560 --> 2:55:54.560]  What the problem is that there's no question about it, that promiscuity among young children and teenagers is the cause of sexually transmitted disease.
[2:55:54.560 --> 2:55:59.560]  Until we say that out loud, it's not going to stop. And all we do is give it different names.
[2:55:59.560 --> 2:56:06.560]  Before, it used to be called syphilis and gonorrhea, then it changed to herpes, then it became apes.
[2:56:06.560 --> 2:56:13.560]  And now they're talking about... And so all they're doing is giving fancy names because we're so politically correct.
[2:56:13.560 --> 2:56:22.560]  We're not allowed to say if you have sexual relations outside of marriage or I'm not trying to be this religious type person...
[2:56:22.560 --> 2:56:29.560]  No, the point is it's dangerous behavior. You're going to get burned. This is serious, serious business.
[2:56:29.560 --> 2:56:38.560]  And so they give you a vaccine, which they admit on the insert doesn't even protect you from the human papillomavirus, all the hundreds of strains.
[2:56:38.560 --> 2:56:40.560]  And then it kills a bunch of people.
[2:56:40.560 --> 2:56:51.560]  Hey, let me tell you something. My senior partner, Dr. Rosie, who's been with me for more than 25 years, calls all these, the Gardasil, the Hepatitis B vaccine, the safe sex vaccine.
[2:56:51.560 --> 2:56:58.560]  What is the message we're giving? We got such great vaccines, you can go and have sex with everyone after you get this vaccine.
[2:56:58.560 --> 2:57:04.560]  I mean, that's the message, you know. I mean, what a message. And all of a sudden people say, wait a minute, that's not a very good message.
[2:57:04.560 --> 2:57:12.560]  And it's no different here than the flu vaccine and the whole vaccine program. You know, I think people are wising up and that's what we're seeing.
[2:57:12.560 --> 2:57:19.560]  You know, it's not as much wising up. They're having the courage to say, you know, Alex may be right.
[2:57:19.560 --> 2:57:27.560]  He may not be that crazy lunatic who's talking about that we need our guns and we need our rights. Maybe there is a constitution still, you know.
[2:57:27.560 --> 2:57:36.560]  This is America and my dad right now is not rolling over his grave. He is saying, you know, the people will wake up and they will vote this administration out.
[2:57:36.560 --> 2:57:40.560]  Will that end it? Nobody, you know what? We'll live another day, you know.
[2:57:40.560 --> 2:57:48.560]  The point is we're in the fight. We're not rolling over to tyranny. I want to come back and take some phone calls, but I want to encourage all the viewers and listeners.
[2:57:48.560 --> 2:58:02.560]  Don't vaccinate before you educate Mayor Eisenstein, MD, JD, MPH. This is the book balanced, real medical facts, real history, 33, 34, 35 years of research.
[2:58:02.560 --> 2:58:08.560]  This is the book that is not full of scare tactics, not full of baloney, not conspiracy theories.
[2:58:08.560 --> 2:58:23.560]  It's available at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com and secure online video bookstore shopping cart. Or you can simply go to the toll free number 888-253-3139.
[2:58:23.560 --> 2:58:34.560]  That's 888-253-3139 to get. Don't vaccinate before you educate. You could save somebody's life. If you've got neighbors that have kids, give it to them.
[2:58:34.560 --> 2:58:39.560]  Be obnoxious. That's what it's all about, saving people. Clear eye by.
[2:59:04.560 --> 2:59:13.560]  There is a solution. Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[3:00:08.560 --> 3:00:22.560]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:00:22.560 --> 3:00:38.560]  Well, for the next hour, by the way, we're live at PrismPlanet.tv. Simon Casting, last two hours, the four-hour show today. We are joined by John Perkins, best-selling, New York Times, number one best-selling, confessions of an economic hitman.
[3:00:38.560 --> 3:00:50.560]  He's got his part two vaunted hoodwinked about to come out in the next few months, already on pre-sell, I'm told, guaranteed to be another best-seller, probably number one again.
[3:00:50.560 --> 3:01:00.560]  And by the way, he is in my upcoming film, Fall of the Republic. So we're going to be, and that's a film all about the economy and what these big corporate interests are doing.
[3:01:00.560 --> 3:01:06.560]  It's bipartisan looking at how both parties are controlled with the same interest. So we're honored to have him with us for the next hour.
[3:01:06.560 --> 3:01:11.560]  Coming up in 30 minutes, we're going to open the phone specifically on confessions of an economic hitman.
[3:01:11.560 --> 3:01:21.560]  Most people know who John is, but it's always best maybe to have him just briefly recap what he did and then why he woke up and changed direction.
[3:01:21.560 --> 3:01:23.560]  Mr. Perkins, great to have you here with us.
[3:01:23.560 --> 3:01:25.560]  Great to be with you, Alex. Thanks for having me on.
[3:01:25.560 --> 3:01:29.560]  On Instagram, I really enjoyed talking with your film crew. You've got a great group of people.
[3:01:29.560 --> 3:01:34.560]  They are good guys. I think I said Aaron Dykes and Rob Dew out to see you out in Florida.
[3:01:34.560 --> 3:01:39.560]  Yeah, they were there. Fantastic. They're really good interviewers. You're going to have a heck of a film.
[3:01:39.560 --> 3:01:44.560]  Oh, it looks great too. Great shot out your back window of the bay there.
[3:01:44.560 --> 3:01:51.560]  Just wonderful. But plus, you're a great interviewer to do. You're even better in person than over the radio, which is hard to believe.
[3:01:51.560 --> 3:01:55.560]  You're a smooth operator, John Perkins. It's almost like you're an economic hitman.
[3:01:55.560 --> 3:01:58.560]  We're really good at patting each other's backs, aren't we, Alex?
[3:01:58.560 --> 3:02:04.560]  No, but it did go well. It did go well. And that is exciting.
[3:02:04.560 --> 3:02:08.560]  Nutshell, tell folks about yourself and get into hoodwinked.
[3:02:08.560 --> 3:02:15.560]  Well, I was an economic hitman, and I think it's fair to say that we economic hitmen have created the world's first truly global empire.
[3:02:15.560 --> 3:02:19.560]  We've done it primarily without the military. First time in history, that's happened.
[3:02:19.560 --> 3:02:27.560]  And we worked many ways, but the most common is that we identify a third-world country that has resources, our corporations covet.
[3:02:27.560 --> 3:02:37.560]  Then we basically convince, bribe, coerce the leaders of those countries that they're accepting loans to build big infrastructure projects.
[3:02:37.560 --> 3:02:44.560]  But the money doesn't go to those countries. Instead, it goes to our own companies that build those projects like hydro dams and highways and airports.
[3:02:44.560 --> 3:02:53.560]  Things that help with two very rich people in those countries, but don't help the majority of the people who don't have enough money to buy electricity or drive cars on the highways
[3:02:53.560 --> 3:03:00.560]  or work in the industrial parks or benefit from them. But the country's not holding a huge debt that it can't be paid.
[3:03:00.560 --> 3:03:08.560]  So at some point we go back and say, you know, you owe us all this money, you can't repay it, so give us a pound of flesh. Sell your oil real cheap to our oil companies.
[3:03:08.560 --> 3:03:14.560]  Or vote with us on the next critical United Nations vote. Send troops in support of ours to someplace like Iraq.
[3:03:14.560 --> 3:03:22.560]  And when we fail, and I talk in my books about how I fail with Jaime Roldos, President of Ecuador, and Omar Tarrillo as a Panama,
[3:03:22.560 --> 3:03:27.560]  when we fail, the jackals go in. And these are CIA-sponsored people who overthrow governments
[3:03:27.560 --> 3:03:33.560]  or assassinate their leaders. Both Roldos and Tarrillos were assassinated because I failed.
[3:03:33.560 --> 3:03:38.560]  And in this way we've really created the world's first truly global empire.
[3:03:38.560 --> 3:03:44.560]  Now what's interesting and what I talk a lot about at Hoodwinked is that we were so successful at doing this in the third world
[3:03:44.560 --> 3:03:49.560]  that now it's come back and the economic hitmen have come home to roost.
[3:03:49.560 --> 3:03:54.560]  These same techniques are being implemented here in the United States as well as throughout the rest of the world.
[3:03:54.560 --> 3:04:01.560]  And it's one of the reasons that we're having this tremendous recession that we're undergoing today, this huge economic tsunami that hit us.
[3:04:01.560 --> 3:04:09.560]  It's really a consequence of these policies that we've been implementing for the last several decades.
[3:04:09.560 --> 3:04:15.560]  We're going to go to break when we come back. Long segment coming up. Let's get into Hoodwinked, which is in many ways a different book
[3:04:15.560 --> 3:04:18.560]  than Confessions of Economic Hitman.
[3:04:18.560 --> 3:04:28.560]  I was in an airport in LA and saw this book store full of people with two people grabbing and buying the books up.
[3:04:28.560 --> 3:04:34.560]  I was watching the stack of economic hitmen go down just in 20 seconds while I was looking at a magazine.
[3:04:34.560 --> 3:04:44.560]  So really exciting that your book has had such success because when I can physically see people buying it off the shelf in front of me in seconds,
[3:04:44.560 --> 3:04:47.560]  it just must be amazing.
[3:04:47.560 --> 3:04:54.560]  When we come back, we'll talk about Hoodwinked probably going to be even bigger with John Perkins and his take on the Blackwater revelations,
[3:04:54.560 --> 3:04:59.560]  how that ties into CIA hit teams, the Jackals and a lot more.
[3:04:59.560 --> 3:05:05.560]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[3:05:05.560 --> 3:05:11.560]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[3:05:11.560 --> 3:05:14.560]  You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.
[3:05:14.560 --> 3:05:22.560]  Inner health botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[3:05:22.560 --> 3:05:30.560]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[3:05:30.560 --> 3:05:36.560]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health manager.
[3:05:36.560 --> 3:05:42.560]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[3:05:42.560 --> 3:05:46.560]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[3:08:28.560 --> 3:08:35.560]  Multiple-time best-selling author of Confessions of an Economic Hitman and now The Secret History of the American Empire.
[3:08:35.560 --> 3:08:41.560]  I forgot this little best-seller. The new one's coming out very, very soon and that is Hoodwinked.
[3:08:41.560 --> 3:08:48.560]  John Perkins, tell us specifically, then we'll get into all these other issues about Hoodwinked when it's coming out, what it covers.
[3:08:48.560 --> 3:08:55.560]  It comes out November 10th at Random House and it's, you know, what we've really generated was the current recession.
[3:08:55.560 --> 3:09:04.560]  And my sense that all of the stuff that we're talking about, AIG, Wall Street, the bank, the auto industry, you know, trying to deal with all of that is triage.
[3:09:04.560 --> 3:09:11.560]  It's putting band-aids on wounds. And we need the band-aids to a certain degree because there's a lot of hemorrhaging going on.
[3:09:11.560 --> 3:09:17.560]  We've got to stop. But what we really need to look at is the root cause beneath the system, beneath the surface.
[3:09:17.560 --> 3:09:22.560]  And that is systemic. And it's something that nobody's really looking at very hard.
[3:09:22.560 --> 3:09:28.560]  To me, this is a mutant form of capitalism that's been going on for about the last 20 years, excuse me, 30 years.
[3:09:28.560 --> 3:09:36.560]  And that's the real problem. We must change that. Sure, we need band-aids, but we need to go much, much deeper than that.
[3:09:36.560 --> 3:09:41.560]  Capitalism has been around for about 400 years. It's taken many, many different forms.
[3:09:41.560 --> 3:09:48.560]  And in the last 30 years, really, since the time of Reagan, and this has happened on both Democrats and Republicans,
[3:09:48.560 --> 3:09:54.560]  but it really started with Reagan, it's taken this trend toward this very mutant viral form of capitalism,
[3:09:54.560 --> 3:09:58.560]  which is extremely greedy and extremely self-destructed ultimately.
[3:09:58.560 --> 3:10:04.560]  It's really the form of capitalism that came out of Milton Friedman, the economist from the University of Chicago,
[3:10:04.560 --> 3:10:09.560]  and Reagan bought into it big time, and every president since has bought into it.
[3:10:09.560 --> 3:10:17.560]  Well, wasn't the Coup de Grasse in 99 with the Glass-Steagall act that Bill Clinton got rid of?
[3:10:17.560 --> 3:10:22.560]  That was a big one. There's no question about it. But that's just sort of like the frosting on the cake.
[3:10:22.560 --> 3:10:29.560]  There's no much going on. Yeah, actually, when I went to business school in the late 60s, Alex,
[3:10:29.560 --> 3:10:33.560]  God, I hate to think of it so long ago, but when I went to business school in the late 60s,
[3:10:33.560 --> 3:10:38.560]  all my professors said there could never be another depression like in the 30s,
[3:10:38.560 --> 3:10:43.560]  because we did act to all these rules to prevent it. Well, that was true, but then we changed all that.
[3:10:43.560 --> 3:10:49.560]  And Glass-Steagall under Clinton was a huge part of that, but there were a whole slew of them that changed,
[3:10:49.560 --> 3:10:53.560]  and there was a whole lot of attitude toward money and usury rates.
[3:10:53.560 --> 3:11:00.560]  Under George Bush we had huge increases in interest rates, but people had to pay credit cards,
[3:11:00.560 --> 3:11:04.560]  went up to 35%. This would have been... Yeah, now they allow over 30%.
[3:11:04.560 --> 3:11:08.560]  That's supposed credit card reform. I mean, that's above loan sharking.
[3:11:08.560 --> 3:11:14.560]  Well, yeah, and that's way beyond the laws never would have permitted this before.
[3:11:14.560 --> 3:11:18.560]  After the recession, we implemented usury laws that didn't permit that, but then those all changed.
[3:11:18.560 --> 3:11:22.560]  There's actually some people paying 800% on their debt.
[3:11:22.560 --> 3:11:25.560]  These people have what we call the payday allowance.
[3:11:25.560 --> 3:11:30.560]  I mean, go in before you actually get your paycheck and get a loan on the expected paycheck,
[3:11:30.560 --> 3:11:34.560]  and those are huge interest rates, and they're legal.
[3:11:34.560 --> 3:11:39.560]  Amazing. Well, the book is coming out on November 11th, correct, John?
[3:11:39.560 --> 3:11:40.560]  November 10th.
[3:11:40.560 --> 3:11:42.560]  Okay, so November 10th.
[3:11:42.560 --> 3:11:43.560]  Less than enough.
[3:11:43.560 --> 3:11:46.560]  And we've got you scheduled for the 11th then. Good.
[3:11:46.560 --> 3:11:47.560]  Oh, good.
[3:11:47.560 --> 3:11:52.560]  Fantastic. They just handed me a note saying he is scheduled for November 11th when it comes out.
[3:11:52.560 --> 3:11:55.560]  So my producer was wrong by one day, so it's coming out November 10th.
[3:11:55.560 --> 3:11:58.560]  Now, I agree with a lot of what you have to say.
[3:11:58.560 --> 3:12:03.560]  Later in the interview, I want to get into, you know, maybe someone of a debate about economic systems and choices.
[3:12:03.560 --> 3:12:09.560]  But I think what we agree on is this crony capitalist system, this mutant form of capitalism.
[3:12:09.560 --> 3:12:13.560]  I just call it piracy. I mean, if they can just create trillions and made up derivatives
[3:12:13.560 --> 3:12:18.560]  and then have the central governments bail them out when they're using the money to then go loan it
[3:12:18.560 --> 3:12:23.560]  at loan-sharking rates to third-world countries, third-world people, the American people.
[3:12:23.560 --> 3:12:27.560]  I mean, that's sick. We give them the government-backed loans.
[3:12:27.560 --> 3:12:35.560]  They then leverage it, fractional reserve it, and then we pay interest to the banks on our money they loan back to us.
[3:12:35.560 --> 3:12:38.560]  I mean, is that a good way of boiling it down?
[3:12:38.560 --> 3:12:42.560]  That certainly is. And it is piracy. There's no question about it.
[3:12:42.560 --> 3:12:45.560]  And we must turn it around, Alex. And that's really it.
[3:12:45.560 --> 3:12:51.560]  That a large part of footwork is what we can do, what you and I and all your listeners can do.
[3:12:51.560 --> 3:12:53.560]  We can take control of this.
[3:12:53.560 --> 3:12:59.560]  One of the things that we have to understand is that big corporations, the banks and the other corporations that are behind this,
[3:12:59.560 --> 3:13:05.560]  are very beholden to us. They only exist because we give them business.
[3:13:05.560 --> 3:13:10.560]  We buy the goods and services, or we allow our tax dollars and our government to go into that.
[3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:14.560]  There are many ways to resist it. I think it's terribly important that we do that now.
[3:13:14.560 --> 3:13:16.560]  We must turn this thing around.
[3:13:16.560 --> 3:13:22.560]  What we have to realize at all of this is that this economic crisis is basically telling us that we have a failed system,
[3:13:22.560 --> 3:13:25.560]  totally failed, on a global basis.
[3:13:25.560 --> 3:13:32.560]  Less than 5% of the world's population live in the United States, and we consume more than 25% of the world's resources.
[3:13:32.560 --> 3:13:38.560]  That's a failure. It's not a model that you can give to China or India or Latin America or Africa.
[3:13:38.560 --> 3:13:45.560]  We need another 5 or 6 planets with all our resources and no people to be able to use this as a model for other people.
[3:13:45.560 --> 3:13:48.560]  So what we're seeing is a totally failed system.
[3:13:48.560 --> 3:13:54.560]  We must understand that for our sake, for our children's sake and our grandchildren's sake, we have to turn this around.
[3:13:54.560 --> 3:13:56.560]  We have to come up with a very, very different system.
[3:13:56.560 --> 3:14:04.560]  John Perkins, I want to get into that area because I agree with you on so much,
[3:14:04.560 --> 3:14:13.560]  and I want to disagree with you in some areas because we know we do have a wasteful form of life, lifestyle.
[3:14:13.560 --> 3:14:18.560]  We know we're 4% of the world's population in the U.S., and we use roughly half the world's resources.
[3:14:18.560 --> 3:14:23.560]  And we know there's a lot of toxic waste associated with that and a lot of problems.
[3:14:23.560 --> 3:14:28.560]  But the way I see government addressing that, and the big mega corporations addressing it,
[3:14:28.560 --> 3:14:34.560]  is by haunt showing and steering the environmental movement to simply set up new taxes and control
[3:14:34.560 --> 3:14:42.560]  to further vertically integrate the consolidation of power in this new phase of robber baron colonialism
[3:14:42.560 --> 3:14:52.560]  because they fundamentally know that there is a certain truth to what's happening to the environment on many levels.
[3:14:52.560 --> 3:15:03.560]  And so they wrap the truth around their overall lie of this new bank of the world global government paying carbon taxes to the new bank of the world.
[3:15:03.560 --> 3:15:11.560]  I mean really it's going from the robber barons going in and economic hitmaning third world countries under their control
[3:15:11.560 --> 3:15:18.560]  to now just setting up a planetary regime under the environment because they know at a base level
[3:15:18.560 --> 3:15:23.560]  that makes sense in people's ingrained humanity to be good stewards of the land.
[3:15:23.560 --> 3:15:32.560]  Well, absolutely. And the way that they distort the truth and move groups so today we've got this huge grassroots movement
[3:15:32.560 --> 3:15:36.560]  basically supported by the insurance industry and the pharmaceutical industry
[3:15:36.560 --> 3:15:42.560]  opposing any kind of real insurance for people that don't have insurance.
[3:15:42.560 --> 3:15:51.560]  We've got the corporations out there trying to make it look as though the people are behind so much of what just benefits the corporation.
[3:15:51.560 --> 3:15:57.560]  And I think one amazing instance of this is what's just happened in Honduras
[3:15:57.560 --> 3:16:05.560]  where a democratically elected president was overthrown by a military regime that was under the control of the CIA
[3:16:05.560 --> 3:16:12.560]  and big American corporate interests. The big agribusiness is Dole and Chiquita, Kraft, Cargo, as well as the textile industry.
[3:16:12.560 --> 3:16:21.560]  And yet here in the United States we're being told that this is the president who was trying to usurp the democratic process in Honduras
[3:16:21.560 --> 3:16:32.560]  which is not true at all. He asked for a referendum of the people to see if they wanted to see presidential terms extended from just one term
[3:16:32.560 --> 3:16:38.560]  for the president to go for two terms. It was a non-binding referendum that he was asking for.
[3:16:38.560 --> 3:16:41.560]  That was used as an excuse to go in and overthrow a president.
[3:16:41.560 --> 3:16:49.560]  And just to be clear, Obama came out day one a month ago and said we're not involved, this is terrible,
[3:16:49.560 --> 3:16:56.560]  but now even mainstream media has come out and clearly shown private corporations, mercenaries, CIA front groups,
[3:16:56.560 --> 3:17:05.560]  Jackals, hyenas that you call them, were clearly involved and did this and even dropped the president off at a Costa Rican U.S. military base.
[3:17:05.560 --> 3:17:09.560]  So I asked you during the break, I said, from what you've seen in the news, is that accurate?
[3:17:09.560 --> 3:17:18.560]  And you said yes. Please elaborate on the difference between an economic hitman versus Jackals and hyenas and what really happened a month ago in Honduras.
[3:17:18.560 --> 3:17:26.560]  Well, an economic hitman went into Honduras originally, tried to convince the liar, the president of Honduras, to change his ways,
[3:17:26.560 --> 3:17:32.560]  because what he was saying is that Honduras is going to increase its minimum wage by 60%.
[3:17:32.560 --> 3:17:41.560]  And that has a huge impact on Joel, Dolan, Chiquita, and those who hire laborers on the field to pick their product, all their goods.
[3:17:41.560 --> 3:17:45.560]  So they're going to go from, what, 50 cents an hour to $1.10 or something?
[3:17:45.560 --> 3:17:55.560]  Exactly. It seems very minimal to us. And also, there's a lot of sweatshops from our textile companies, companies like Mikey and other companies like that in there.
[3:17:55.560 --> 3:18:02.560]  But it's much bigger than that, because something similar happened with Aristide and Haiti.
[3:18:02.560 --> 3:18:11.560]  And both Haiti and Honduras are looked at as the bottom rung on the ladder of wages in Latin America.
[3:18:11.560 --> 3:18:18.560]  So no country will go below those countries. So if, in fact, Honduras or Haiti increases their minimum wage,
[3:18:18.560 --> 3:18:27.560]  then Ecuador and Nicaragua and El Salvador and every other country in the southern hemisphere has to increase its wages to stay above those,
[3:18:27.560 --> 3:18:30.560]  because no one wants to go below those countries.
[3:18:30.560 --> 3:18:34.560]  So it wasn't just about Honduras any more than it was just about Haiti.
[3:18:34.560 --> 3:18:40.560]  It was about drawing a line in the sand and saying, we are not going to permit this to happen.
[3:18:40.560 --> 3:18:44.560]  And I think we have to understand that there's a revolution going on in Latin America.
[3:18:44.560 --> 3:18:52.560]  Ten countries representing more than 80% of the population of South America have voted in in the last few years progressive presidents
[3:18:52.560 --> 3:18:56.560]  who are saying no more exploitation by these foreign corporations.
[3:18:56.560 --> 3:19:06.560]  Ten countries. And every one of these countries, Alex, during most of my lifetime was run by brutal dictators who were under the control of the CIA and big corporations.
[3:19:06.560 --> 3:19:13.560]  That's all changed very, very recently. And so the line in the sand now has been drawn in Honduras.
[3:19:13.560 --> 3:19:22.560]  This is a fairly easy country to do it, but this is trying to establish a whole new precedent saying, look, we're stopping this revolution right here.
[3:19:22.560 --> 3:19:29.560]  And in stopping it, we're also going to undermine these other ten countries that have already voted in these presidents.
[3:19:29.560 --> 3:19:40.560]  And most of the American people don't have any idea that this is going on, and our media has been very lacked at informing us other than you.
[3:19:40.560 --> 3:19:49.560]  Well, we're trying to get all points of view and all issues in here, and clearly the CIA was involved in this because they want to keep those people down.
[3:19:49.560 --> 3:20:00.560]  It's like that movie Ants. If you let one ant stand up, they might all stand up and those little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[3:20:19.560 --> 3:20:29.560]  If you see anything in your car, home, boat or office yet is safe enough for your children and pets, Biogreen Clean does not contain harmful chemical solvents such as commonly used chemicals,

[3:21:01.560 --> 3:21:07.560]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:21:07.560 --> 3:21:13.560]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[3:21:13.560 --> 3:21:19.560]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[3:21:19.560 --> 3:21:24.560]  Well Obama's already fudging, but since day one in this election.
[3:21:24.560 --> 3:21:35.560]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:21:35.560 --> 3:21:40.560]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one world government.
[3:21:40.560 --> 3:21:47.560]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told and his real agenda.

[3:21:59.560 --> 3:22:05.560]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Minus Resources, August 24, 2009.
[3:22:05.560 --> 3:22:15.560]  Goal opened this morning at 9.5660, a one ounce gold coin to be purchased for at 9.8389, 4.9195 for a half ounce, or 2.4597 for a quarter ounce.
[3:22:15.560 --> 3:22:20.560]  That's 9.8389, 4.9195, or 2.4597.
[3:22:20.560 --> 3:22:27.560]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit,
[3:22:27.560 --> 3:22:34.560]  then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt.
[3:22:34.560 --> 3:22:37.560]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said,
[3:22:37.560 --> 3:22:43.560]  a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[3:22:43.560 --> 3:22:48.560]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.

[3:24:00.560 --> 3:24:10.560]  Music
[3:24:10.560 --> 3:24:12.560]  The new book, Hood Wink, coming out November 10th.
[3:24:12.560 --> 3:24:14.560]  John Perkins, our guest.
[3:24:14.560 --> 3:24:18.560]  Your phone calls specifically for John Perkins on a wide range of issues.
[3:24:18.560 --> 3:24:22.560]  1-800-259-9231.
[3:24:22.560 --> 3:24:25.560]  1-800-259-9231.
[3:24:25.560 --> 3:24:28.560]  Coming up in the balance of the next half hour.
[3:24:28.560 --> 3:24:33.560]  John, you specifically all over Latin America, all over Asia.
[3:24:33.560 --> 3:24:36.560]  You were kind of the velvet glove.
[3:24:36.560 --> 3:24:38.560]  I would describe it from reading your book.
[3:24:38.560 --> 3:24:41.560]  And also reading other government documents about similar programs.
[3:24:41.560 --> 3:24:47.560]  Going in, trying to, you know, give them the carrot instead of the stick.
[3:24:47.560 --> 3:24:51.560]  But when the stick goes in, what happens?
[3:24:51.560 --> 3:24:57.560]  And then asking that question, I want to preface it with, obviously, you know, about black water running hit teams.
[3:24:57.560 --> 3:25:01.560]  But the media has spun this saying, oh, just killing Al Qaeda.
[3:25:01.560 --> 3:25:03.560]  And that's who ever they say Al Qaeda is.
[3:25:03.560 --> 3:25:11.560]  Now it turns out it's business people, political enemies, business enemies of the White House, actual private merc teams.
[3:25:11.560 --> 3:25:17.560]  We know Delta Force and other groups out of the Pentagon have engaged in murder.
[3:25:17.560 --> 3:25:21.560]  But is this new to have private contractors doing it?
[3:25:21.560 --> 3:25:24.560]  Or are we now just learning about it because of the internet age?
[3:25:24.560 --> 3:25:29.560]  It's not new at all. It's been going on for a long time back in the 70s when I was an economic hitman.
[3:25:29.560 --> 3:25:31.560]  We use private contractors.
[3:25:31.560 --> 3:25:38.560]  That's the way it's done. You know, the old times of the 007, the government agent license to kill a long, long gone.
[3:25:38.560 --> 3:25:41.560]  It's all done with private contractors.
[3:25:41.560 --> 3:25:48.560]  It's coming out because black water is coming out because, yeah, and as you said, the internet age is bringing it out.
[3:25:48.560 --> 3:25:54.560]  Plus, I think what we're beginning to understand is that terrorism is an insane word.
[3:25:54.560 --> 3:25:57.560]  This war on terror is ridiculous.
[3:25:57.560 --> 3:26:00.560]  There's no terrorism out there.
[3:26:00.560 --> 3:26:04.560]  There are people who practice terrorism, but from many different walks of life.
[3:26:04.560 --> 3:26:11.560]  So the FARC members in Colombia have nothing in common with the Somali pirate or Al Qaeda.
[3:26:11.560 --> 3:26:14.560]  And yet they're all lumped under this one ism.
[3:26:14.560 --> 3:26:24.560]  Is it the war on terror, John? Just a global letter of Mark by Western governments to kill, steal, destroy, torture, murder, whoever you want.
[3:26:24.560 --> 3:26:27.560]  And anybody that resists you is called a terrorist.
[3:26:27.560 --> 3:26:32.560]  That's a great way to put it. Yes, the letter of Mark. That's a great way to put it, Alex.
[3:26:32.560 --> 3:26:38.560]  Yeah, you know, there was communism, and that truly existed. There's Catholicism.
[3:26:38.560 --> 3:26:47.560]  There's all kinds of isms, but terrorism really isn't an ism. You know, there's Al Qaeda ism, there's FARC ism, but they're totally separate.
[3:26:47.560 --> 3:26:52.560]  And yeah, this is just a way of making it sound as though we've got some huge enemy out there.
[3:26:52.560 --> 3:27:05.560]  What we really get out there is a bunch of starving people, unhappy people, who latch on to fanatical leaders like Osama bin Laden because they don't know what else to do.
[3:27:05.560 --> 3:27:10.560]  And they do it under FARC in Columbia. I know a lot of the members of FARC, and I know they shouldn't say a lot.
[3:27:10.560 --> 3:27:12.560]  I know some members of FARC.
[3:27:12.560 --> 3:27:19.560]  These are farmers who were driven off the land by big hydroelectric projects or oil fields that destroyed their farming land.
[3:27:19.560 --> 3:27:22.560]  They have no way to feed their families. They don't know where to go.
[3:27:22.560 --> 3:27:31.560]  So when an organization comes along like FARC that offers to provide them with money for their families and food, they join it.
[3:27:31.560 --> 3:27:35.560]  I suspect the same is true with Al Qaeda and with the Taliban to a third degree.
[3:27:35.560 --> 3:27:53.560]  Well, John, what about this? I've actually found in my research a lot of times western powers and corporations will actually fund the radical group that is bloody and crooked as a way down the road to then successfully demonize the entire indigenous population.
[3:27:53.560 --> 3:28:01.560]  So they always push people towards the most radicalized, knowing down the road that will discredit the indigenous resistance.
[3:28:01.560 --> 3:28:07.560]  It discredits the right. It does do that, and it also creates a huge economy for big military suppliers.
[3:28:07.560 --> 3:28:11.560]  So here we've got this war on terrorism in Columbia.
[3:28:11.560 --> 3:28:23.560]  Columbia is the fourth largest recipient of U.S. military aid in the world, largest in Latin America, but it's fourth behind Iraq, Israel, and Egypt.
[3:28:23.560 --> 3:28:35.560]  To fight what we're saying are knockout traffickers. It's absurd. We're creating a war there, basically, so we can put military bases there and we can supply huge amounts of military equipment to those countries.
[3:28:35.560 --> 3:28:41.560]  So we give them the money under the understanding that they'll buy back equipment from us and allow us to have military bases there.
[3:28:41.560 --> 3:28:51.560]  Yeah, you know, this goes back to the Ethiopian wars of the British Empire and China and India. It's a very, very old tale, and we're just continuing to do it.
[3:28:51.560 --> 3:28:56.560]  And unfortunately, a huge sector of the American population falls for it.
[3:28:56.560 --> 3:29:03.560]  We're going to break in a moment, a long segment coming up, and we're going to get more into that, and also one of the new constitutions in Ecuador.
[3:29:03.560 --> 3:29:08.560]  But did you see the... I'll ask the question now. We'll come back and you can answer it.
[3:29:08.560 --> 3:29:12.560]  Ridge, fellow cabinet members, pushed terror alerts.
[3:29:12.560 --> 3:29:24.560]  Now, we know Ari Fleischer back in 2003 admitted they were issuing fake terror alerts at a press conference, and I understand he did it because he knew it was criminal.
[3:29:24.560 --> 3:29:31.560]  He never said why, but I was guessing at this, and that he didn't want to get in trouble down the road as if he was involved.
[3:29:31.560 --> 3:29:43.560]  Now that's what Ridge is saying that he's coming clean because he doesn't want to get in trouble, and the news is saying this is clearly criminal to issue fake terror alerts just for political gain.
[3:29:43.560 --> 3:29:50.560]  So talk about stage crises. How do these big corporations and governments huge stage crises to get the job done?
[3:29:50.560 --> 3:30:00.560]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:00.560 --> 3:30:05.560]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[3:30:05.560 --> 3:30:09.560]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:30:09.560 --> 3:30:15.560]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[3:30:15.560 --> 3:30:20.560]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:30:20.560 --> 3:30:26.560]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[3:30:26.560 --> 3:30:30.560]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[3:30:30.560 --> 3:30:34.560]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[3:30:34.560 --> 3:30:38.560]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:30:38.560 --> 3:30:44.560]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long time sponsor of ours.

[3:30:59.560 --> 3:31:03.560]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[3:31:03.560 --> 3:31:08.560]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[3:31:08.560 --> 3:31:13.560]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[3:31:13.560 --> 3:31:17.560]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[3:31:17.560 --> 3:31:23.560]  Now or after the battle starts, when will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:31:23.560 --> 3:31:26.560]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[3:31:26.560 --> 3:31:31.560]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[3:31:31.560 --> 3:31:35.560]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:31:35.560 --> 3:31:41.560]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[3:31:41.560 --> 3:31:44.560]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[3:31:44.560 --> 3:31:54.560]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:31:54.560 --> 3:31:59.560]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[3:31:59.560 --> 3:32:03.560]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[3:32:03.560 --> 3:32:09.560]  Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor,
[3:32:09.560 --> 3:32:14.560]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[3:32:14.560 --> 3:32:19.560]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[3:32:19.560 --> 3:32:21.560]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[3:32:21.560 --> 3:32:28.560]  The Acola Blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[3:32:28.560 --> 3:32:35.560]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration,
[3:32:35.560 --> 3:32:39.560]  reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[3:32:39.560 --> 3:32:42.560]  That's right, clean water right from the air you breathe.
[3:32:42.560 --> 3:32:47.560]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[3:32:47.560 --> 3:32:57.560]  That's 1-800-691-6043 or visit Acola Blue on the web at www.ecoloblu.com today.
[3:32:57.560 --> 3:33:11.560]  That's acolablu.com.
[3:33:11.560 --> 3:33:27.560]  1-800-259-9231. 1-800-259-9231. I am Alex Jones. Glad that you could join us today.
[3:33:27.560 --> 3:33:32.560]  I'm looking for my sponsor folder here in front of me flailing.
[3:33:32.560 --> 3:33:37.560]  I'm flailing around incoherently.
[3:33:37.560 --> 3:33:41.560]  I'd like to, John Perkins, here in just a moment.
[3:33:41.560 --> 3:33:46.560]  Before I do that, I want to tell you about one of our great new sponsors,
[3:33:46.560 --> 3:33:49.560]  and they are offering a deal, the likes of which they've never offered before,
[3:33:49.560 --> 3:33:55.560]  so I would suggest everyone take advantage of this now.
[3:33:55.560 --> 3:33:58.560]  In fact, one of their most popular times of year is during the fall,
[3:33:58.560 --> 3:34:02.560]  and that is when the classes generally completely fill up quickly,
[3:34:02.560 --> 3:34:07.560]  and especially now because they're offering a free Springfield Armory XD pistol
[3:34:07.560 --> 3:34:09.560]  in the caliber of your choice.
[3:34:09.560 --> 3:34:16.560]  It's frontsite.com, frontsite.com, frontsite firearms training with Dr. Ignatius Piazza.
[3:34:16.560 --> 3:34:22.560]  This is the biggest and most successful private firearms training facility in the country,
[3:34:22.560 --> 3:34:27.560]  above law enforcement military with no drill instructor or tough guy attitude.
[3:34:27.560 --> 3:34:32.560]  Find out about this incredible deal on five days of world-class firearms training
[3:34:32.560 --> 3:34:38.560]  at frontsite.com and a 30 state concealed weapons permit at frontsite.com.
[3:34:38.560 --> 3:34:41.560]  Check it out today.
[3:34:41.560 --> 3:34:46.560]  Okay, going now back to John Perkins,
[3:34:46.560 --> 3:34:52.560]  author of the new upcoming book, Hoodwinked out November 10th.
[3:34:52.560 --> 3:34:55.560]  Again, previously he wrote The Secret History of the American Empire,
[3:34:55.560 --> 3:34:58.560]  and of course, Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[3:34:58.560 --> 3:35:02.560]  You heard me throw out that question as more and more comes out.
[3:35:02.560 --> 3:35:07.560]  I mean, Cheney ordering private hit teams and Delta Force hit teams
[3:35:07.560 --> 3:35:11.560]  to murder his enemies overseas, corporate enemies overseas,
[3:35:11.560 --> 3:35:15.560]  Ridge being ordered to issue fake terror alerts,
[3:35:15.560 --> 3:35:18.560]  and Obama is saying no investigation of torture,
[3:35:18.560 --> 3:35:21.560]  no investigation of Blackwater,
[3:35:21.560 --> 3:35:25.560]  no investigation of any of this, or he'll do the corporate tech to say,
[3:35:25.560 --> 3:35:28.560]  I'm looking at it, but then not do it.
[3:35:28.560 --> 3:35:33.560]  He's keeping the continual secret arrest indefinite detention.
[3:35:33.560 --> 3:35:39.560]  Can you speak to prosecuting or at least investigating Bush,
[3:35:39.560 --> 3:35:42.560]  or can we just, I guess, let him get away with it?
[3:35:42.560 --> 3:35:48.560]  I mean, what does this do precedent-wise to let them get away with Blackwater
[3:35:48.560 --> 3:35:51.560]  and underage girls and all the rest of it?
[3:35:51.560 --> 3:35:53.560]  I mean, is there no end?
[3:35:53.560 --> 3:35:56.560]  If we put up with this level of evil, what comes next?
[3:35:56.560 --> 3:36:01.560]  Exactly right. We mustn't, I mean, we mustn't put up with it.
[3:36:01.560 --> 3:36:04.560]  I think we, the people, must really speak out.
[3:36:04.560 --> 3:36:08.560]  My own belief, you know, I think Obama's in a very difficult spot.
[3:36:08.560 --> 3:36:11.560]  Obviously, I'm not privy to what's going on with him.
[3:36:11.560 --> 3:36:17.560]  I'm not a psychologist, but he has to know that Kennedy was assassinated.
[3:36:17.560 --> 3:36:20.560]  I mean, U.S. presidents get assassinated, too.
[3:36:20.560 --> 3:36:22.560]  It isn't just foreign presidents.
[3:36:22.560 --> 3:36:26.560]  And once you're in that White House, I think you begin to see things that you never saw before.
[3:36:26.560 --> 3:36:29.560]  I suspect Obama is getting tremendous amount of pressure put on him.
[3:36:29.560 --> 3:36:32.560]  It's one of the reasons he's been caving into so many things.
[3:36:32.560 --> 3:36:35.560]  You know, his own attorney general, Eric Holder,
[3:36:35.560 --> 3:36:41.560]  was a partner at a law firm called Covington and Burling, LLP.
[3:36:41.560 --> 3:36:50.560]  This law firm extended Chiquita, the big banana company that's now the big company in Honduras.
[3:36:50.560 --> 3:36:54.560]  Chiquita was accused of firing a assassination squad in Colombia.
[3:36:54.560 --> 3:36:58.560]  And their main defender was an attorney named Eric Holder, who's now our attorney general.
[3:36:58.560 --> 3:37:00.560]  Is that United Fruit?
[3:37:00.560 --> 3:37:02.560]  Chiquita.
[3:37:02.560 --> 3:37:06.560]  What was Chiquita former? Was it Standard Fruit or United Fruit?
[3:37:06.560 --> 3:37:09.560]  Yeah, Chiquita was United Fruit at one time.
[3:37:09.560 --> 3:37:15.560]  So that's the famous folks, then overthrowing on record Guatemala.
[3:37:15.560 --> 3:37:17.560]  They are bans of Guatemala, yes.
[3:37:17.560 --> 3:37:19.560]  So same story over and over.
[3:37:19.560 --> 3:37:21.560]  Okay, sort of interrupting.
[3:37:21.560 --> 3:37:22.560]  Same story.
[3:37:22.560 --> 3:37:26.560]  Chiquita, incidentally, was found guilty of firing assassination squads in Colombia.
[3:37:26.560 --> 3:37:32.560]  In fact, it is admitted that it had paid organizations listed by the U.S. government as terrorist groups for protection
[3:37:32.560 --> 3:37:37.560]  and paid a $25 million fine in 2004.
[3:37:37.560 --> 3:37:41.560]  Eric Holder, our current attorney general, was their main defender then.
[3:37:41.560 --> 3:37:49.560]  And now he's defending the actions of the coup that overthrew Democratic elected president Honduras.
[3:37:49.560 --> 3:37:56.560]  It's just another instance, Alex, of how ingrained all of this is in all of our governments,
[3:37:56.560 --> 3:38:03.560]  whether we have Democrats in there, including the most liberal Democrat we've had, the current one, Obama,
[3:38:03.560 --> 3:38:06.560]  or whether we have conservative Republicans like Bush.
[3:38:06.560 --> 3:38:11.560]  The real people in control of the big corporations, and they really run the system.
[3:38:11.560 --> 3:38:14.560]  We're seeing this over and over and over again.
[3:38:14.560 --> 3:38:21.560]  And so you've got guys like Cheney, you've got guys like all the cabinet members you mentioned earlier
[3:38:21.560 --> 3:38:26.560]  who now are trying not to be found guilty of being involved in assassination attempts.
[3:38:26.560 --> 3:38:31.560]  But the fact of the matter is all these people at the top of government came from out of the big corporations.
[3:38:31.560 --> 3:38:33.560]  This is a revolving door thing.
[3:38:33.560 --> 3:38:38.560]  And so whether it's Democrats or Republicans, you've got people that are constantly at the top,
[3:38:38.560 --> 3:38:43.560]  I call it the corporate talk receipt, because whether they're working for the government
[3:38:43.560 --> 3:38:46.560]  or whether they're working for private corporations,
[3:38:46.560 --> 3:38:49.560]  they're all working for the same thing, which is expanding this empire.
[3:38:49.560 --> 3:38:55.560]  Well, John Perkins, I'm not defending Obama because I saw him built up as this big corporate juggernaut.
[3:38:55.560 --> 3:38:59.560]  I saw him getting four plus times the money that McCain got.
[3:38:59.560 --> 3:39:01.560]  I wasn't supporting McCain either.
[3:39:01.560 --> 3:39:04.560]  I just was clear he was the anointed one.
[3:39:04.560 --> 3:39:08.560]  But I do have to give credit when I do occasionally see it.
[3:39:08.560 --> 3:39:14.560]  Panetta did scurry over immediately to Congress within days of getting in and said,
[3:39:14.560 --> 3:39:19.560]  look, they just admitted to me they've got all these hit squads.
[3:39:19.560 --> 3:39:21.560]  So at least he did that.
[3:39:21.560 --> 3:39:23.560]  But was that him covering his butt?
[3:39:23.560 --> 3:39:28.560]  Because then you bring up the attorney general who's been involved in black ops.
[3:39:28.560 --> 3:39:32.560]  I would add Oklahoma City, by the way, very scary person.
[3:39:32.560 --> 3:39:35.560]  We've got some federal documents on that in covering things up.
[3:39:35.560 --> 3:39:42.560]  So are you just saying, I mean, if it is business as usual, then why would Panetta come out?
[3:39:42.560 --> 3:39:49.560]  Well, you know, again, I don't have any inside information on Obama's personality or those people around him.
[3:39:49.560 --> 3:39:55.560]  But my suspicion is that he's probably a guy with a conscience who would like to do the right thing.
[3:39:55.560 --> 3:39:58.560]  His name is People, but you get caught in the system.
[3:39:58.560 --> 3:40:02.560]  And once you're in, it's extremely scary.
[3:40:02.560 --> 3:40:03.560]  And what are you going to do?
[3:40:03.560 --> 3:40:05.560]  How are you going to fight the CIA?
[3:40:05.560 --> 3:40:06.560]  How are you going to fight the military?
[3:40:06.560 --> 3:40:10.560]  So you try to do whatever you can on whatever front you can.
[3:40:10.560 --> 3:40:14.560]  I've seen this happen time and time again with Latin American presidents who want to do the right things,
[3:40:14.560 --> 3:40:18.560]  but realize that if they get thrown out or if they get assassinated,
[3:40:18.560 --> 3:40:23.560]  that's not going to do any good because the next president coming along is going to be scared, terribly scared,
[3:40:23.560 --> 3:40:24.560]  and not going to do anything.
[3:40:24.560 --> 3:40:28.560]  So you try to stay in power and you try to do what you can.
[3:40:28.560 --> 3:40:33.560]  In the case of a guy like Obama, he's tried to institute some environmental laws that are decent
[3:40:33.560 --> 3:40:40.560]  and he's tried to do things with health insurance, but he keeps running up against very, very powerful forces of resistance.
[3:40:40.560 --> 3:40:42.560]  And so it comes down to us.
[3:40:42.560 --> 3:40:44.560]  We have to speak out a lot more.
[3:40:44.560 --> 3:40:46.560]  We have to do a lot more.
[3:40:46.560 --> 3:40:52.560]  We, the people, we have to stand up to corporations and say, listen, I'm not buying from Dole or Chiquita.
[3:40:52.560 --> 3:40:57.560]  You know, and send them emails and tell them we're never buying another one of your bananas or pineapples
[3:40:57.560 --> 3:40:59.560]  because of what you're doing in Honduras.
[3:40:59.560 --> 3:41:02.560]  You change your ways or we're going to force you to go out of business.
[3:41:02.560 --> 3:41:06.560]  And I'll tell you what, if enough of us do that, they'll have to change their ways.
[3:41:06.560 --> 3:41:10.560]  If enough of us stop buying Nike and send them emails and say,
[3:41:10.560 --> 3:41:15.560]  we're not buying from you because you get sweatshops in Indonesia and instead we buy from sweatshop free organizations
[3:41:15.560 --> 3:41:17.560]  and send them emails and tell them why.
[3:41:17.560 --> 3:41:20.560]  Eventually Nike's going to have to change its ways.
[3:41:20.560 --> 3:41:26.560]  We do agree with you that responsible consumerism is one of the strongest tools we've got.
[3:41:26.560 --> 3:41:31.560]  That's why these monopoly men want to create nothing but cartels where we don't even have a choice.
[3:41:31.560 --> 3:41:34.560]  But, I mean, just take 10 years ago, you couldn't find organic.
[3:41:34.560 --> 3:41:37.560]  Even in Austin or San Francisco, it was hard to get.
[3:41:37.560 --> 3:41:46.560]  Now, organics, even in small towns, because people demanded it and then built a market, buying local, is getting bigger and bigger.
[3:41:46.560 --> 3:41:51.560]  Then we've gotten, because companies, they've transfed out of foods recently and, you know,
[3:41:51.560 --> 3:41:54.560]  we got rid of aerosol cans that were destroying the ozone layer.
[3:41:54.560 --> 3:41:57.560]  We've got companies that clean up terribly polluted rivers.
[3:41:57.560 --> 3:41:59.560]  We have a lot of power when we use it.
[3:41:59.560 --> 3:42:03.560]  I think we need to understand that it's always come from we, the people.
[3:42:03.560 --> 3:42:08.560]  We didn't get rid of slavery in this country because Abraham Lincoln found himself in the White House.
[3:42:08.560 --> 3:42:13.560]  We got rid of slavery because we voted in the president, Lincoln, who was opposed to slavery.
[3:42:13.560 --> 3:42:17.560]  Women didn't get the right to vote because Woodrow Wilson was pro-suffrage.
[3:42:17.560 --> 3:42:18.560]  He was not.
[3:42:18.560 --> 3:42:22.560]  Women got the right to vote because they'd been demonstrating for it for a long time.
[3:42:22.560 --> 3:42:28.560]  And then, when Wilson was president, he constantly was out on the road speaking about how we needed to get involved in World War I,
[3:42:28.560 --> 3:42:30.560]  how we needed to defend democracy in Europe.
[3:42:30.560 --> 3:42:34.560]  Women met him at every place he went holding up huge placards that said,
[3:42:34.560 --> 3:42:39.560]  why should we defend democracy in Europe when half of our population in the United States can't vote?
[3:42:39.560 --> 3:42:43.560]  So finally, Woodrow Wilson came around.
[3:42:43.560 --> 3:42:47.560]  We didn't get out of Vietnam because Richard Nixon was anti-war.
[3:42:47.560 --> 3:42:48.560]  He was pro-war.
[3:42:48.560 --> 3:42:51.560]  He had to take us out of Vietnam because he understood that we, the people,
[3:42:51.560 --> 3:42:54.560]  were not going to put up with it any longer, plus we were losing the war.
[3:42:54.560 --> 3:42:59.560]  But I think we need to understand that we, the people, need to take action.
[3:42:59.560 --> 3:43:02.560]  And in this particular case, in some respects, it's easier than it's ever been
[3:43:02.560 --> 3:43:06.560]  because these things are all controlled by big corporations today.
[3:43:06.560 --> 3:43:10.560]  And the marketplace is democratic if we choose to make it such.
[3:43:10.560 --> 3:43:14.560]  These corporations only exist because we buy the goods and services
[3:43:14.560 --> 3:43:17.560]  or our tax dollars buy the goods and services.
[3:43:17.560 --> 3:43:18.560]  Alex, we need to turn that around.
[3:43:18.560 --> 3:43:21.560]  We, the people, need to start taking more responsibility.
[3:43:21.560 --> 3:43:23.560]  It doesn't do any good to complain about these things
[3:43:23.560 --> 3:43:28.560]  and then go out and buy bananas from Dole or tennis shoes from Nike.
[3:43:28.560 --> 3:43:29.560]  Sure.
[3:43:29.560 --> 3:43:31.560]  John, I agree with you on that front.
[3:43:31.560 --> 3:43:36.560]  And I believe you're coming at this from a good perspective that you're a good guy
[3:43:36.560 --> 3:43:38.560]  that you have changed your ways.
[3:43:38.560 --> 3:43:43.560]  I just think it's also important to realize that just trying to do the right thing
[3:43:43.560 --> 3:43:44.560]  isn't enough.
[3:43:44.560 --> 3:43:51.560]  We have to make sure we're not part of the fake corporate clone or counterfeit
[3:43:51.560 --> 3:43:55.560]  where they try to get control of our grassroots movements
[3:43:55.560 --> 3:44:00.560]  and then say, use environmental laws to take farms and ranches or restrict people.
[3:44:00.560 --> 3:44:01.560]  Take Austin.
[3:44:01.560 --> 3:44:03.560]  I've watched them with smart growth.
[3:44:03.560 --> 3:44:04.560]  Take farms and ranches.
[3:44:04.560 --> 3:44:05.560]  Now let people build on it.
[3:44:05.560 --> 3:44:10.560]  And then 10 years later, they build shopping malls on it and sky scrapers.
[3:44:10.560 --> 3:44:14.560]  So I also see the environmental movement run by the big banks
[3:44:14.560 --> 3:44:18.560]  by the very economic pirate ships.
[3:44:18.560 --> 3:44:20.560]  These corporations bigger than most governments.
[3:44:20.560 --> 3:44:22.560]  And so, yes, I know there's real environmental problems.
[3:44:22.560 --> 3:44:24.560]  I don't want to drink poison water.
[3:44:24.560 --> 3:44:26.560]  I don't want to drink poison air.
[3:44:26.560 --> 3:44:28.560]  I breathe poison air.
[3:44:28.560 --> 3:44:30.560]  I don't want to cut down rainforest.
[3:44:30.560 --> 3:44:34.560]  I don't want to live off the backs of starving people in Peru.
[3:44:34.560 --> 3:44:39.560]  But at the same time, it's a big job to navigate this and try to figure out
[3:44:39.560 --> 3:44:41.560]  what's real and what isn't.
[3:44:41.560 --> 3:44:43.560]  And how do you not get co-opted?
[3:44:43.560 --> 3:44:47.560]  I mean, because it sounds great to take Ecuador and say they have a Constitution
[3:44:47.560 --> 3:44:51.560]  saying that they're going to give trees and animals rights.
[3:44:51.560 --> 3:44:56.560]  But then I always see that by the neo-eugenicists as their pretext to say
[3:44:56.560 --> 3:45:00.560]  the world government's going to vote for you because it's voting for the cockroaches
[3:45:00.560 --> 3:45:04.560]  and the dolphins, and they outvote humanity.
[3:45:04.560 --> 3:45:08.560]  So I'm just saying this is a minefield because these global corporations
[3:45:08.560 --> 3:45:12.560]  are in power because they are so slick.
[3:45:12.560 --> 3:45:14.560]  Well, you're right about that.
[3:45:14.560 --> 3:45:21.560]  But I think that we can see beyond a great deal of that.
[3:45:21.560 --> 3:45:25.560]  We can see that they're using their powers and abusing it.
[3:45:25.560 --> 3:45:28.560]  We can see this in the way they take care of themselves.
[3:45:28.560 --> 3:45:30.560]  I do a lot of speaking at business schools these days,
[3:45:30.560 --> 3:45:33.560]  but I find ironic that business schools even invite me to speak.
[3:45:33.560 --> 3:45:35.560]  I have a book called Confessions of an Economic Kid Mem.
[3:45:35.560 --> 3:45:39.560]  But the kids in these business schools, many of them are really interested
[3:45:39.560 --> 3:45:40.560]  in some of these subjects.
[3:45:40.560 --> 3:45:44.560]  And one of the things I keep running into is some of the icons that are held out there.
[3:45:44.560 --> 3:45:48.560]  A guy named Jack Welch, who was CEO of General Electric,
[3:45:48.560 --> 3:45:52.560]  is held out as his great icon because he made his corporation lean and mean,
[3:45:52.560 --> 3:45:56.560]  he laid off a quarter of GE's people, put them out on the street,
[3:45:56.560 --> 3:46:01.560]  but at the same time he paid himself huge bonuses and salary increases.
[3:46:01.560 --> 3:46:05.560]  And he also took GE away from manufacturing things,
[3:46:05.560 --> 3:46:09.560]  goods, being a manufacturing firm into being a financial paper trading firm,
[3:46:09.560 --> 3:46:12.560]  which is one of the things that drove us into the financial crisis.
[3:46:12.560 --> 3:46:15.560]  Yeah, it's engaged in derivatives, that's right.
[3:46:15.560 --> 3:46:19.560]  How do we hold a guy like that out as an icon in our business schools?
[3:46:19.560 --> 3:46:20.560]  We should not.
[3:46:20.560 --> 3:46:23.560]  And I think if we really open our hearts to these things,
[3:46:23.560 --> 3:46:26.560]  we understand that, you understand that, Alex, I understand it.
[3:46:26.560 --> 3:46:28.560]  We've got to turn this thing around,
[3:46:28.560 --> 3:46:32.560]  and we've got to present a better example to our kids.
[3:46:32.560 --> 3:46:34.560]  Who do they want to emulate?
[3:46:34.560 --> 3:46:36.560]  Who do we want to put on the covers of our magazine?
[3:46:36.560 --> 3:46:40.560]  Do we want to put Kirk's modern Robert Barron on the cover of our magazine?
[3:46:40.560 --> 3:46:42.560]  Or do we want to put people there who are really trying?
[3:46:42.560 --> 3:46:43.560]  I totally agree with you.
[3:46:43.560 --> 3:46:46.560]  In fact, I talk so much about the map making of the mind,
[3:46:46.560 --> 3:46:49.560]  or blueprints in the mind, how the establishment builds these,
[3:46:49.560 --> 3:46:52.560]  and I'm not saying Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods,
[3:46:52.560 --> 3:46:55.560]  or somebody shouldn't be on the cover of something,
[3:46:55.560 --> 3:46:57.560]  or Brock Lesnar of Ultimate Fighting,
[3:46:57.560 --> 3:47:01.560]  but when this country was the jewel in the crown of the Renaissance,
[3:47:01.560 --> 3:47:06.560]  the stars were inventors and scientists and humanitarians,
[3:47:06.560 --> 3:47:09.560]  and people that stood up against corruption.
[3:47:09.560 --> 3:47:14.560]  And so the establishment very cunningly took our real heroes away
[3:47:14.560 --> 3:47:17.560]  and gave us heroes of no consequence.
[3:47:17.560 --> 3:47:19.560]  Well, that's true, and we don't need to let that happen anymore.
[3:47:19.560 --> 3:47:21.560]  Yeah, you mentioned Tiger Woods, for example.
[3:47:21.560 --> 3:47:23.560]  My God, you know, here's a guy that's making,
[3:47:23.560 --> 3:47:25.560]  I don't know what he's making this year,
[3:47:25.560 --> 3:47:27.560]  $40 million off Nike or whatever.
[3:47:27.560 --> 3:47:28.560]  Meanwhile, Nike's paying...
[3:47:28.560 --> 3:47:30.560]  No, it's paid $109 million.
[3:47:30.560 --> 3:47:32.560]  $109 million.
[3:47:32.560 --> 3:47:35.560]  Well, meanwhile, Nike's paying its workers in Indonesia
[3:47:35.560 --> 3:47:38.560]  that make all the things that Michael Jordan is advertising.
[3:47:38.560 --> 3:47:42.560]  Sub-living standards, wages.
[3:47:42.560 --> 3:47:45.560]  These people are living almost like slaves,
[3:47:45.560 --> 3:47:47.560]  and then that's well documented.
[3:47:47.560 --> 3:47:48.560]  Yeah.
[3:47:48.560 --> 3:47:50.560]  So, you know, why doesn't Tiger Woods,
[3:47:50.560 --> 3:47:52.560]  if he wants to be our hero,
[3:47:52.560 --> 3:47:53.560]  he doesn't need to hit any more golf balls,
[3:47:53.560 --> 3:47:55.560]  what he needs to do is say, listen,
[3:47:55.560 --> 3:47:57.560]  I'm not going to let Nike get away with it anymore,
[3:47:57.560 --> 3:47:59.560]  I'm going to speak out,
[3:47:59.560 --> 3:48:01.560]  or I'm going to advertise some other company,
[3:48:01.560 --> 3:48:03.560]  and I'll do it for free,
[3:48:03.560 --> 3:48:05.560]  some company that's paying their...
[3:48:05.560 --> 3:48:07.560]  That would revolutionize the world,
[3:48:07.560 --> 3:48:09.560]  but see, Tiger Woods, the only reason I know about this
[3:48:09.560 --> 3:48:12.560]  is I've looked into him, and I heard the number on the radio,
[3:48:12.560 --> 3:48:16.560]  on Fox News Radio, they announced his $100-plus million contract,
[3:48:16.560 --> 3:48:20.560]  and that's just Nike not counting this watch and that shirt,
[3:48:20.560 --> 3:48:24.560]  and I guess all of us have to not buy it while they do that,
[3:48:24.560 --> 3:48:26.560]  but Tiger Woods has been interviewed
[3:48:26.560 --> 3:48:29.560]  how he isn't involved in any politics,
[3:48:29.560 --> 3:48:32.560]  in any policies, in any charities,
[3:48:32.560 --> 3:48:38.560]  really except for some charity for college dealing with golf.
[3:48:38.560 --> 3:48:41.560]  He thinks it's a moral thing that he's not involved.
[3:48:41.560 --> 3:48:44.560]  He thinks it's like a good thing,
[3:48:44.560 --> 3:48:46.560]  and the corporations just worship him
[3:48:46.560 --> 3:48:48.560]  because he is cold-blooded,
[3:48:48.560 --> 3:48:51.560]  and I can't imagine having $100 million a year
[3:48:51.560 --> 3:48:56.560]  based on people dying of diseases in sweatshops
[3:48:56.560 --> 3:48:59.560]  in these horrible, malaria-infested camps,
[3:48:59.560 --> 3:49:01.560]  and McKelodora's, I mean,
[3:49:01.560 --> 3:49:03.560]  and I'm not some goody-tooth shoe,
[3:49:03.560 --> 3:49:05.560]  I mean, I'm a pretty hard-nosed guy,
[3:49:05.560 --> 3:49:08.560]  but yeah, Tiger Woods could become a mega icon,
[3:49:08.560 --> 3:49:10.560]  his life would have real value,
[3:49:10.560 --> 3:49:13.560]  instead it's this hollow crap of hitting a golf ball.
[3:49:13.560 --> 3:49:15.560]  You're absolutely right, John, it's sickening.
[3:49:15.560 --> 3:49:17.560]  Well, yeah, and ultimately,
[3:49:17.560 --> 3:49:19.560]  you know, who buys the magazines?
[3:49:19.560 --> 3:49:20.560]  Who buys into this?
[3:49:20.560 --> 3:49:21.560]  Who watches an ontology?
[3:49:21.560 --> 3:49:23.560]  And we do, you know,
[3:49:23.560 --> 3:49:26.560]  and so it's time that we stopped doing that,
[3:49:26.560 --> 3:49:29.560]  it's time that we took back control,
[3:49:29.560 --> 3:49:31.560]  and this is where it really belongs,
[3:49:31.560 --> 3:49:34.560]  Alex, is that we, the people,
[3:49:34.560 --> 3:49:37.560]  have to recognize that we have responsibility,
[3:49:37.560 --> 3:49:40.560]  and if we want a country of buying for the people,
[3:49:40.560 --> 3:49:43.560]  instead of one that's of buying for the elite,
[3:49:43.560 --> 3:49:45.560]  the corporations, et cetera,
[3:49:45.560 --> 3:49:48.560]  we've got to get off our butts and do something about it,
[3:49:48.560 --> 3:49:50.560]  and I think that's what you're calling for all the time,
[3:49:50.560 --> 3:49:52.560]  so it's one of the reasons I love being on your show,
[3:49:52.560 --> 3:49:56.560]  because you're inspiring and empowering people to do that,
[3:49:56.560 --> 3:49:58.560]  and we need to do it more and more and more,
[3:49:58.560 --> 3:50:01.560]  because it's always been the way that change has happened.
[3:50:01.560 --> 3:50:02.560]  I agree, but John,
[3:50:02.560 --> 3:50:04.560]  what would you call that corporate attitude?
[3:50:04.560 --> 3:50:06.560]  I don't know the word for it,
[3:50:06.560 --> 3:50:08.560]  where they get off on being cold-blooded,
[3:50:08.560 --> 3:50:10.560]  they get off on not caring,
[3:50:10.560 --> 3:50:13.560]  they think it's silly to, I mean, that's a very...
[3:50:13.560 --> 3:50:16.560]  That's sociopathic.
[3:50:16.560 --> 3:50:18.560]  Yeah, sociopathic.
[3:50:18.560 --> 3:50:21.560]  And you know, I think that at the top of a number of our corporations,
[3:50:21.560 --> 3:50:25.560]  we do have sociopath people who have basically no conscience
[3:50:25.560 --> 3:50:27.560]  that don't care about what harm they bring to others,
[3:50:27.560 --> 3:50:29.560]  I think Jack Welch was a person like that,
[3:50:29.560 --> 3:50:33.560]  and I think, yeah, I think tonight is still night at night years,
[3:50:33.560 --> 3:50:35.560]  but throughout the rest of the corporation,
[3:50:35.560 --> 3:50:37.560]  most of the other managers and people are not,
[3:50:37.560 --> 3:50:40.560]  and those are the ones we need to get to.
[3:50:40.560 --> 3:50:42.560]  Well, absolutely, but I mean,
[3:50:42.560 --> 3:50:44.560]  also we destroy our own world,
[3:50:44.560 --> 3:50:46.560]  not just environmentally,
[3:50:46.560 --> 3:50:47.560]  but culturally.
[3:50:47.560 --> 3:50:48.560]  Yeah.
[3:50:48.560 --> 3:50:50.560]  This attitude, I see the local yuppies
[3:50:50.560 --> 3:50:53.560]  mimic it, and they're into laughing at bad things happening,
[3:50:53.560 --> 3:50:55.560]  as if it doesn't touch them.
[3:50:55.560 --> 3:50:56.560]  When they're kids,
[3:50:56.560 --> 3:50:58.560]  they're gonna end up committing suicide or on drugs
[3:50:58.560 --> 3:51:00.560]  in this sick society.
[3:51:00.560 --> 3:51:02.560]  Four years, doctors and researchers have known
[3:51:02.560 --> 3:51:04.560]  that one of the major pathways to better health
[3:51:04.560 --> 3:51:07.560]  is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants
[3:51:07.560 --> 3:51:09.560]  to keep the body and proper pH balance.
[3:51:09.560 --> 3:51:12.560]  For 15 years, people had trusted Alcazone,
[3:51:12.560 --> 3:51:15.560]  the simplest way of keeping the body and pH balance,
[3:51:15.560 --> 3:51:17.560]  getting rid of acidic waste buildup
[3:51:17.560 --> 3:51:19.560]  and boosting the immune system through antioxidant support.
[3:51:19.560 --> 3:51:23.560]  Alcazone's unique formula contains potassium, magnesium, calcium,
[3:51:23.560 --> 3:51:25.560]  zinc, and the antioxidant selenium,
[3:51:25.560 --> 3:51:28.560]  along with 79 trace minerals from ancient marine deposits.
[3:51:28.560 --> 3:51:31.560]  Unlike other products, Alcazone is odorless and tasteless,
[3:51:31.560 --> 3:51:34.560]  and can be added to any beverage to offset its acidity.
[3:51:34.560 --> 3:51:37.560]  Alcazone also manufactures antioxidant water fountains
[3:51:37.560 --> 3:51:39.560]  that will both filter and raise the pH of the tap water
[3:51:39.560 --> 3:51:41.560]  in your home to a pH of 10.

[3:52:01.560 --> 3:52:04.560]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[3:52:04.560 --> 3:52:07.560]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:07.560 --> 3:52:10.560]  We've got to have a civilian national security force
[3:52:10.560 --> 3:52:14.560]  that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[3:52:14.560 --> 3:52:17.560]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[3:52:17.560 --> 3:52:21.560]  that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[3:52:21.560 --> 3:52:23.560]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[3:52:23.560 --> 3:52:25.560]  Yeah, but since day one in this election.
[3:52:25.560 --> 3:52:28.560]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[3:52:28.560 --> 3:52:31.560]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program
[3:52:31.560 --> 3:52:35.560]  of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[3:52:35.560 --> 3:52:37.560]  that's fascism.
[3:52:37.560 --> 3:52:40.560]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[3:52:40.560 --> 3:52:43.560]  This film documents who Obama works for,
[3:52:43.560 --> 3:52:47.560]  the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:52:55.560 --> 3:53:24.560]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[3:53:26.560 --> 3:53:31.560]  Here's what Dr. Goodman has to say about his experience with the product.
[3:53:31.560 --> 3:53:34.560]  If you notice that most times here at the drug ads on TV,
[3:53:34.560 --> 3:53:36.560]  they have a list of possible side effects,
[3:53:36.560 --> 3:53:38.560]  I find that if you're going to take something
[3:53:38.560 --> 3:53:41.560]  that if you're trading one problem for five or six other problems,
[3:53:41.560 --> 3:53:43.560]  that to me doesn't make sense.
[3:53:43.560 --> 3:53:47.560]  Using something that is natural, that is absorbed into the body,
[3:53:47.560 --> 3:53:50.560]  particularly because in a liquid form, I think is the best way to go.

[3:54:00.560 --> 3:54:26.560]  We're just talking about all the websites and groups we can find out about.
[3:54:26.560 --> 3:54:30.560]  And then I hear these arguments about, oh, if there's not a sweatshop,
[3:54:30.560 --> 3:54:32.560]  they wouldn't have any job. No.
[3:54:32.560 --> 3:54:35.560]  In every study I've seen, and Ross Perot covered this in the mid-90s,
[3:54:35.560 --> 3:54:38.560]  it made the standard of living in Mexico go down.
[3:54:38.560 --> 3:54:40.560]  Standard of living in Brazil go down.
[3:54:40.560 --> 3:54:42.560]  Standard of living in Indonesia go down.
[3:54:42.560 --> 3:54:44.560]  It makes it go down.
[3:54:44.560 --> 3:54:47.560]  It does not make it go up, and it makes our standard go down.
[3:54:47.560 --> 3:54:50.560]  It's just this globalization, the way they're doing it,
[3:54:50.560 --> 3:54:52.560]  is killing everything.
[3:54:52.560 --> 3:54:55.560]  Rusty in Texas, you're on the air with John Perkins.
[3:54:55.560 --> 3:54:58.560]  Hello.
[3:54:58.560 --> 3:55:00.560]  Yes, go ahead.
[3:55:00.560 --> 3:55:02.560]  Yes, sir, thank you for taking my call.
[3:55:02.560 --> 3:55:05.560]  I just took Texas government this last year,
[3:55:05.560 --> 3:55:09.560]  and they talked about this thing called creative destruction.
[3:55:09.560 --> 3:55:15.560]  And creative destruction is supposed to be like a business gets so big
[3:55:15.560 --> 3:55:20.560]  that eventually it collapses on it within itself and goes broke,
[3:55:20.560 --> 3:55:25.560]  or the people quit buying the products because they just get tired of it.
[3:55:25.560 --> 3:55:30.560]  But I don't see how it can be fair to go and bail these companies out,
[3:55:30.560 --> 3:55:33.560]  basically giving them a new deal,
[3:55:33.560 --> 3:55:39.560]  because capitalism itself is like a live and let die kind of way of living,
[3:55:39.560 --> 3:55:43.560]  because one man's loss is another man's gain.
[3:55:43.560 --> 3:55:45.560]  Let me get a quick comment from John Perkins.
[3:55:45.560 --> 3:55:48.560]  I would just briefly say, this is crony capitalism,
[3:55:48.560 --> 3:55:52.560]  and it's been said many times where the risk is socialized,
[3:55:52.560 --> 3:55:57.560]  the profit is privatized, so it's not really capitalism.
[3:55:57.560 --> 3:55:58.560]  John Perkins.
[3:55:58.560 --> 3:56:00.560]  Yeah, no, I totally agree with you.
[3:56:00.560 --> 3:56:03.560]  That's why I say that I'm calling it mutant form of capitalism,
[3:56:03.560 --> 3:56:09.560]  where it's all balanced in favor of a few very, very wealthy and powerful people.
[3:56:09.560 --> 3:56:13.560]  But we need to turn that around, and we can do that.
[3:56:13.560 --> 3:56:15.560]  It's like going to a casino where you never win.
[3:56:15.560 --> 3:56:17.560]  It's totally rigged.
[3:56:17.560 --> 3:56:21.560]  Yeah, but only because we allow it to be rigged.
[3:56:21.560 --> 3:56:22.560]  We can stop it.
[3:56:22.560 --> 3:56:25.560]  It's not going to be easy, but we can do it.
[3:56:25.560 --> 3:56:31.560]  Well, we better, because they're just feeding the whole world into their debt-lack hole.
[3:56:31.560 --> 3:56:32.560]  Ronnie in Texas.
[3:56:32.560 --> 3:56:34.560]  Go ahead, you're on the air with John Perkins.
[3:56:34.560 --> 3:56:36.560]  Upcoming book, hoodwinked.
[3:56:36.560 --> 3:56:37.560]  Go ahead.
[3:56:37.560 --> 3:56:42.560]  Perkins, I lived for nine months in poverty-ridden Peru under US puppet Toledo,
[3:56:42.560 --> 3:56:49.560]  and it dawned on me there that would not absolute freedom, and I'm asking you, absolute freedom worldwide for farmers,
[3:56:49.560 --> 3:56:56.560]  help cancel all continually counterproductive wars on behalf of illegal drug warlords.
[3:56:56.560 --> 3:57:00.560]  So we're waging in Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Afghanistan, all over the world.
[3:57:00.560 --> 3:57:02.560]  You're asking how is the phony drug war?
[3:57:02.560 --> 3:57:11.560]  Well, I loved watching General Meyers on TV last night explain how the occupation had made the opium production go way up.
[3:57:11.560 --> 3:57:13.560]  That's a good final comment from John Perkins.
[3:57:13.560 --> 3:57:14.560]  John?
[3:57:14.560 --> 3:57:15.560]  Yeah.
[3:57:15.560 --> 3:57:19.560]  I mean, the farmers around the world have really been hit hard.
[3:57:19.560 --> 3:57:26.560]  They've been hit hard by what we call free trade agreements, where it's absurd today that
[3:57:26.560 --> 3:57:30.560]  a Mexican farmer can produce cotton a lot more cheaply than a US farmer,
[3:57:30.560 --> 3:57:37.560]  but you can buy US-produced cotton in Mexico for a lot less of a price than Mexican cotton,
[3:57:37.560 --> 3:57:41.560]  simply because it's so subsidized in the United States for the big industries,
[3:57:41.560 --> 3:57:48.560]  and this is where the small farmer, time and time again, whether cotton or corn or soybeans or whatever it is,
[3:57:48.560 --> 3:57:54.560]  the small farmer has been very, very screwed, and a lot of these people are now what we call terrorists
[3:57:54.560 --> 3:57:57.560]  because they've lost their property, have no way of feeding their family,
[3:57:57.560 --> 3:58:03.560]  and so they become part of organizations that are fanatical because they don't know what else to do.
[3:58:03.560 --> 3:58:07.560]  Yeah, in Mexico, they'll just let you go die.
[3:58:07.560 --> 3:58:15.560]  In Mexico City, just die in your hut, no welfare system, and it's just hellish.
[3:58:15.560 --> 3:58:19.560]  Well, the new book's coming out, and we're going to interview you the day after it comes out November 11th,
[3:58:19.560 --> 3:58:22.560]  coming up in a month and a half or so.
[3:58:22.560 --> 3:58:26.560]  John Perkins, best-selling author of Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[3:58:26.560 --> 3:58:29.560]  It was great having you on. We'll talk to you again soon, my friend.
[3:58:29.560 --> 3:58:32.560]  My pleasure, Alex. Keep it to your good work.

[3:58:50.560 --> 3:58:55.560]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[3:58:55.560 --> 3:59:00.560]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[3:59:00.560 --> 3:59:03.560]  Doctored and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate.
