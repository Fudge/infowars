[00:00:04.918 --> 00:00:09.741]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.741 --> 00:00:11.342]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.342 --> 00:00:12.882]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:17.085]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:21.147]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.103 --> 00:00:38.766]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:41.928]  It is Monday, the 15th day of February, 2010.
[00:00:41.928 --> 00:00:48.912]  We're gonna be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:48.912 --> 00:00:54.135]  I feel like I have a giant weight on me.
[00:00:54.135 --> 00:00:57.477]  They say with great knowledge comes sorrow.
[00:01:00.872 --> 00:01:15.841]  I have a much greater understanding than the average person that isn't saying much for how the world actually operates and works because I've decided to study it and to apply myself.
[00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:19.683]  And I understand the tricks of the establishment.
[00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:29.749]  I understand their systems of control, how they confuse and confound the population, how they dumb down and rob the population, how they turn every
[00:01:33.277 --> 00:01:40.822]  aspect of man's sinful nature against him, how they magnify it.
[00:01:40.822 --> 00:01:52.209]  I understand the globalist program, their agenda, their mindset, what makes them tick, the type of world they are building.
[00:01:52.209 --> 00:02:00.254]  I understand how they control the major political parties of every nation on the planet except for a handful.
[00:02:00.254 --> 00:02:02.055]  And because the nature of evil in government
[00:02:03.226 --> 00:02:06.647]  A few countries that oppose the New World Order are evil themselves.
[00:02:06.647 --> 00:02:11.347]  That is their leadership.
[00:02:11.347 --> 00:02:29.131]  And I know that mankind is going into a very, very dark time.
[00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:30.991]  And I desperately just want
[00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.592]  To at least slow it down.
[00:02:37.592 --> 00:02:40.213]  A lot of people are waking up.
[00:02:40.213 --> 00:02:43.074]  A lot of people are becoming conscious.
[00:02:43.074 --> 00:02:45.955]  The problem is the system didn't get where it is.
[00:02:45.955 --> 00:02:49.977]  The power elite didn't get where they are by being stupid.
[00:02:49.977 --> 00:02:52.898]  And they know how to take over movements.
[00:02:52.898 --> 00:02:59.200]  They know the best way to control opposition is to lead it.
[00:03:01.263 --> 00:03:04.023]  That's what Barack Obama was and is.
[00:03:04.023 --> 00:03:08.104]  He was the opposition to Bush, bought and paid for by Goldman Sachs.
[00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.345]  Same people that finance Bush.
[00:03:10.345 --> 00:03:13.125]  The private fellow reserve bankers.
[00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:17.786]  And now, a year into his administration, the public's wise to him.
[00:03:17.786 --> 00:03:21.847]  The good news is people are getting wise faster and faster.
[00:03:21.847 --> 00:03:27.628]  And so now they've got Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck leading the opposition, or trying to.
[00:03:27.628 --> 00:03:29.308]  And we know who they are and what they are.
[00:03:31.533 --> 00:03:32.574]  At least a lot of us do.
[00:03:32.574 --> 00:03:35.235]  A lot of people don't.
[00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:45.581]  And so it's my job to expose their foils, their minions, their fronts, their loyal opposition.
[00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:46.942]  Let me be clear about something.
[00:03:46.942 --> 00:03:50.264]  I don't like this job.
[00:03:50.264 --> 00:03:57.729]  Oh, I enjoy the triumph of fighting tyranny and our successes, but actually being here every day, having the responsibility
[00:03:59.386 --> 00:04:06.871]  The forced obsession to constantly focus on this, to constantly research, to constantly gain greater knowledge.
[00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:20.441]  It is quite a weight to bear.
[00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:24.224]  I am blasted.
[00:04:24.224 --> 00:04:26.846]  I know I'm right.
[00:04:26.846 --> 00:04:28.127]  I know how to fix the system.
[00:04:29.468 --> 00:04:34.050]  I know how to bring the globalists to justice.
[00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.693]  And I'll tell you, it's lonely.
[00:04:39.693 --> 00:04:48.417]  Because, in the scheme of the world, this radio show, my websites, my films, are tiny.
[00:04:48.417 --> 00:04:50.338]  But it's the best we've got.
[00:04:50.338 --> 00:04:50.758]  We are it.
[00:04:52.142 --> 00:04:59.945]  I'm gonna break all the news down and get into why I'm so concerned because I've now foreseen the next move in the enemy's operation.
[00:04:59.945 --> 00:05:06.948]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:05:06.948 --> 00:05:09.009]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[00:06:01.951 --> 00:06:05.973]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.973 --> 00:06:09.175]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.175 --> 00:06:10.616]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.003]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.003 --> 00:06:20.409]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:25.594]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:25.594 --> 00:06:35.583]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.703 --> 00:06:38.045]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:38.045 --> 00:06:39.625]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.625 --> 00:06:42.087]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.087 --> 00:06:44.228]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.228 --> 00:06:49.372]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.372 --> 00:06:58.477]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:00.658 --> 00:07:03.260]  Men, are you thinking about the health of your prostate?
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.983]  Recently, New Vitality Health Products gave away thousands of free bottles of the supplement Beta Prostate.
[00:07:08.983 --> 00:07:15.087]  Due to incredible demand, they're giving away more free bottles of Beta Prostate to any new customers who call now.
[00:07:15.087 --> 00:07:18.989]  Beta Prostate is packed with plant sterols that support your prostate health.

[00:07:24.813 --> 00:07:33.359]  Beta-prostate is so powerful, you'd have to take 100 sawpaw metal capsules in order to get the same natural plant sterols as one beta-prostate.
[00:07:33.359 --> 00:07:37.862]  And if you haven't tried beta-prostate yet, you can call right now for a free bottle.

[00:07:57.716 --> 00:08:01.958]  1-800-360-8306.
[00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:08.583]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.583 --> 00:08:19.650]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:20.531]  I love the truth.
[00:08:22.771 --> 00:08:37.421]  All I've ever tried to do is be honest, to be steadfast, to have courage, and to be committed in the fight against tyranny.
[00:08:37.421 --> 00:08:42.465]  That's all I've ever tried to do.
[00:08:42.465 --> 00:08:45.107]  And I know that a lot of people
[00:08:48.999 --> 00:08:59.502]  Hear the truths that we discuss here on this radio broadcast every day, and that they're frightening.
[00:08:59.502 --> 00:09:04.044]  The problem is you can't choose your own reality.
[00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:12.046]  The advertising moguls and gurus will tell you that perception is reality, but perception is not reality.
[00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:23.945]  I've used the analogy many times of someone on PCP standing on top of a 40-story balcony and believing they're a bird and can fly.
[00:09:23.945 --> 00:09:25.625]  It's happened many times.
[00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:28.326]  People on hallucinogens think they can fly.
[00:09:28.326 --> 00:09:37.610]  And they jump off the top of the building and they think they're flying for maybe 10 seconds until they hit the concrete below and splatter all over the ground.
[00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:54.235]  You see, if you have a distorted sense of reality, then your perception of reality is not reality.
[00:09:54.235 --> 00:09:57.816]  It's very simple.
[00:09:57.816 --> 00:10:00.937]  I know we have an illegitimate criminal government.
[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:12.110]  I know that they have declassified, anyone can look this up, more than 200 cases of staged terror attacks.
[00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:24.342]  It is on record, it is admitted that we have a group of criminals running our society that have staged more than 200 terror attacks that are declassified.
[00:10:24.342 --> 00:10:26.204]  And if you look at any other major nation,
[00:10:27.461 --> 00:10:35.589]  And their history, they will have countless admitted cases of the government staging crises.
[00:10:35.589 --> 00:10:38.372]  It's even been declassified more than a decade ago.
[00:10:38.372 --> 00:10:42.476]  I had read it in books and in declassified congressional reports.
[00:10:42.476 --> 00:10:50.564]  I couldn't believe it four years ago in a Dallas hotel room watching a front line about Nixon
[00:10:51.735 --> 00:11:02.021]  Where he planned to bomb his own Republican National Convention and the Democratic National Convention to blame it on his political enemies.
[00:11:02.021 --> 00:11:04.602]  But word got out and they backed off.
[00:11:04.602 --> 00:11:10.845]  They couldn't find enough people that were that criminal in the government at the time to do it.
[00:11:10.845 --> 00:11:13.567]  They even go on television and admit this.
[00:11:13.567 --> 00:11:14.407]  I'll never forget.
[00:11:14.407 --> 00:11:17.109]  Oh, it must have been six years ago.
[00:11:17.109 --> 00:11:18.770]  I went out to buy some light bulbs.
[00:11:22.352 --> 00:11:51.003]  And I sat there for 30 minutes in the parking lot of Home Depot, listening to NPR, and they were airing a special about Kermit Roosevelt, because he had just died, and how Kermit Roosevelt wrote a book, CIA Section Chief, 1953, over the Middle East, where he admitted that they funded radical Muslims to stage terror attacks and blame it on Mohammed Mosaddegh.
[00:11:52.247 --> 00:11:58.131]  Now, I already knew that that had been partially declassified in the 80s.
[00:11:58.131 --> 00:12:11.619]  I knew that Kermit Roosevelt had written the book years before, what, in 1999?
[00:12:11.619 --> 00:12:17.823]  But to hear them come right out and admit it was amazing.
[00:12:17.823 --> 00:12:20.165]  They had audio recordings of him bragging about it.
[00:12:23.806 --> 00:12:35.349]  They staged terror attacks and then printed out tens of thousands of handbills with Mohammed Mosaddegh supposedly taking credit for it.
[00:12:35.349 --> 00:12:47.832]  The secular leader of Iran, who just wanted his country to be out from under the control of Anglo-American oil.
[00:12:47.832 --> 00:12:51.433]  We knew in 1964 the Gulf of Tonkin had been staged.
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:13:02.563]  To get us into Vietnam, because the different officers on the ships came back and told the San Diego newspaper.
[00:13:02.563 --> 00:13:19.069]  But it was called a conspiracy theory until 2004, when they released more than 3,000 hours of audio conversations between LBJ and Robert McNamara and others.
[00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:21.930]  And let me tell you, it's hard to listen to, but I've done it.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:32.003]  I've listened to scores of hours of it.
[00:13:32.003 --> 00:13:40.907]  And all I want to do is to warn people so they know the peril they are in.
[00:13:40.907 --> 00:13:53.232]  It wasn't fun six months before, three months before, two months before, a week before, 9-11, eight years ago, to go on the radio
[00:14:00.163 --> 00:14:14.491]  And to tell listeners that the government was going to stage a terror attack on the World Trade Centers and blame it on their known CIA asset, Osama Bin Laden.
[00:14:14.491 --> 00:14:25.998]  But the truth is the truth.
[00:14:25.998 --> 00:14:27.999]  It isn't fun to swim upstream.
[00:14:29.474 --> 00:14:40.080]  It'd be more fun to just get in the inner tube and float downstream into the new world order and go along with it.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:45.824]  But I have to tell the truth.
[00:14:45.824 --> 00:14:57.891]  It was my duty day one to come out against Barack Obama and to point out I'm not saying vote for McCain.
[00:14:57.891 --> 00:14:58.912]  There isn't even an issue.
[00:15:00.768 --> 00:15:03.168]  McCain isn't the chosen one.
[00:15:03.168 --> 00:15:07.369]  The whole point was, this has been pre-vetted and pre-destined.
[00:15:07.369 --> 00:15:15.031]  That's why Obama got four times the campaign money from the banks that run this country.
[00:15:15.031 --> 00:15:17.151]  Because he was the chosen one.
[00:15:17.151 --> 00:15:25.473]  And I told you in the Obama deception in Fall of the Republic, he would be built up, and then he would be destroyed.
[00:15:25.473 --> 00:15:27.493]  And he is now being destroyed.
[00:15:28.766 --> 00:15:32.770]  And they will build up the next crop of saviors.
[00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:36.073]  People like Sarah Palin and Rick Perry.
[00:15:36.073 --> 00:15:45.742]  The word is those two in the next three years are going to be running on a presidential ticket.
[00:15:45.742 --> 00:15:52.549]  Oh, it'd be a lot more fun in my flesh to just play the Republican game, the fake Libertarian game,
[00:15:54.261 --> 00:16:04.090]  And to go along with the power structure and to be on 500 radio stations and to be all over national TV and get wined and dined.
[00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:08.194]  In the short term, my family would be a lot safer.
[00:16:08.194 --> 00:16:14.800]  I would be wealthy.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.801]  But it means nothing.
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:26.685]  My family has no future and your family has no future in this new world order.
[00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:47.255]  But it's so easy for the world to go out and find people of every stripe and every political name to serve them and to play the part of the rebels so that the people believe that they're getting the system fixed only to be conned again.
[00:16:52.469 --> 00:17:08.184]  It is physically, it is financially, it is politically dangerous to tell the truth and to tell it on a platform this big.
[00:17:08.184 --> 00:17:11.867]  And we are big.
[00:17:11.867 --> 00:17:17.273]  And I know that I have passed another great threshold into a whole nother level
[00:17:18.497 --> 00:17:29.582]  Danger it gives me a tingle down my spine and in my good old boy guts.
[00:17:29.582 --> 00:17:43.548]  Oh It is dangerous to tell the truth Physically Emotionally financially But it is
[00:17:44.642 --> 00:17:51.466]  Far more dangerous to not tell the truth spiritually.
[00:17:51.466 --> 00:17:53.807]  And that's all that matters.
[00:17:53.807 --> 00:17:57.669]  And so I commit myself into God's hands.
[00:17:57.669 --> 00:18:00.371]  I don't pray and tell God what I want.
[00:18:00.371 --> 00:18:12.577]  I ask God that His will be done.
[00:18:12.577 --> 00:18:13.178]  Sometimes,
[00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:41.752]  In the dark of the night, though, I do hit my knees and cry out to God and say, I'm committed to this fight, but my God, the discernment, the understanding, and the weight it creates to have real vision, to understand, and to
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:56.233]  Not even begin to be able to explain it to people in all its intricacies, in all its subtleties, and in all of its import.
[00:18:56.233 --> 00:19:03.000]  The magnitude of the world controllers, the magnitude of who they are,
[00:19:04.167 --> 00:19:12.790]  And what they serve, and what they are building, what they are weaving, what they are constructing, is so horrific.
[00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:19.332]  I don't blame any of you listening for wanting to run away from the truth.
[00:19:19.332 --> 00:19:22.833]  But even if you run away from it, the evil is still there.
[00:19:22.833 --> 00:19:26.614]  The truth is still there.
[00:19:26.614 --> 00:19:29.535]  That's why you have so much anxiety.
[00:19:29.535 --> 00:19:32.536]  And they try to misplace it onto fake Al Qaeda or
[00:19:33.962 --> 00:19:40.705]  Other bogeymen they create.
[00:19:40.705 --> 00:19:46.427]  This is going to be a focused broadcast today.
[00:19:46.427 --> 00:19:55.430]  I have more than 10 stacks of news, every article in every stack, incredibly vital.
[00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:59.052]  And I want to lay out the globalist's next phase of operations for you.
[00:20:00.762 --> 00:20:06.223]  For safety, you lock doors, set alarms, buy antivirus software, maybe even have a watchdog.
[00:20:06.223 --> 00:20:08.544]  Do you care as much about your air and water?

[00:20:30.288 --> 00:20:39.612]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:39.612 --> 00:20:46.655]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:46.655 --> 00:20:50.597]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:20:50.797 --> 00:20:51.737]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:20:51.737 --> 00:20:55.439]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:20:55.439 --> 00:20:57.759]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:57.759 --> 00:21:02.041]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:02.041 --> 00:21:06.042]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:21:06.042 --> 00:21:09.303]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:21:09.303 --> 00:21:10.724]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:21:11.425 --> 00:21:14.088]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:21:14.088 --> 00:21:20.494]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:21:20.494 --> 00:21:25.679]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:21:25.679 --> 00:21:35.668]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:21:35.788 --> 00:21:38.130]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.712]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:21:39.712 --> 00:21:42.174]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:21:42.174 --> 00:21:44.297]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:21:44.297 --> 00:21:49.462]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:23:00.427 --> 00:23:03.968]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:23:03.968 --> 00:23:06.248]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:23:06.248 --> 00:23:07.128]  Don't!
[00:23:07.128 --> 00:23:10.569]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:23:10.569 --> 00:23:19.651]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[00:23:19.651 --> 00:23:23.312]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.

[00:23:26.875 --> 00:23:34.240]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.421]  Herb K was right.
[00:23:35.421 --> 00:23:38.604]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:23:38.604 --> 00:23:39.965]  What have you got to lose?
[00:23:39.965 --> 00:23:43.668]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.

[00:23:52.575 --> 00:23:56.598]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:23:56.598 --> 00:23:58.299]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:23:58.299 --> 00:23:59.540]  There is a war on for your mind.
[00:24:19.346 --> 00:24:48.063]  And all I ask is that you study history and research the global controllers and stop being caught up in distractions and diversions and all the different establishment minions they put out there, the buffet of lies, all the different choices you're given, all spiked with poison, spiked with lies and deception.
[00:24:52.541 --> 00:25:07.984]  I worked with Paul Watson this morning some on a story that he is going to be posting tomorrow.
[00:25:07.984 --> 00:25:17.766]  And the subject is so important that I almost shrink.
[00:25:17.766 --> 00:25:18.486]  I recoil.
[00:25:21.323 --> 00:25:44.812]  From even covering it because there's so much evidence and so much proof that I feel like I'm not even worthy to be here and to be this radio talk show host and to run InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:25:44.812 --> 00:25:45.933]  I want to do it right.
[00:25:45.933 --> 00:25:47.793]  I want to cover things properly.
[00:25:47.793 --> 00:25:49.234]  I want to put the evidence on.
[00:25:51.144 --> 00:25:54.086]  So people can conceptualize it and fully understand it.
[00:25:54.086 --> 00:25:56.727]  I want to unlock minds.
[00:25:56.727 --> 00:25:59.368]  I want people to understand what I understand.
[00:25:59.368 --> 00:26:06.232]  And I know a lot of you do understand what I understand and more.
[00:26:06.232 --> 00:26:11.475]  But so many others are like children politically.
[00:26:11.475 --> 00:26:13.456]  And I just hate seeing them conned.
[00:26:13.456 --> 00:26:16.097]  I hate seeing them being deceived.
[00:26:20.447 --> 00:26:27.809]  I hate watching foreign banks loot our country and the shops and businesses and factories shut down.
[00:26:27.809 --> 00:26:34.871]  At the same time, I see all our victories against tyranny intensifying, becoming greater by the day.
[00:26:34.871 --> 00:26:45.574]  So there is a lot of good things that are happening that we need to talk about as well.
[00:26:45.574 --> 00:26:47.115]  And there's also the broader picture.
[00:26:50.063 --> 00:26:54.225]  That we need to talk about.
[00:26:54.225 --> 00:27:11.612]  But coming up, at the bottom of the next hour, we're going to simulcast the last two and a half hours in living color at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:27:11.612 --> 00:27:13.653]  I am going to start breaking down
[00:27:20.575 --> 00:27:27.118]  Part one of the current globalist agenda.
[00:27:27.118 --> 00:27:31.979]  How they're trying to implement the next phase of their agenda.
[00:27:31.979 --> 00:27:36.861]  A further bankrupt and deindustrialized West.
[00:27:36.861 --> 00:27:41.283]  A new war with Iran.
[00:27:41.283 --> 00:27:45.985]  And an expanding paramilitary global police state of rapid reaction forces.
[00:27:48.564 --> 00:27:56.926]  To oppress and smash all resistance to the New World Order.
[00:27:56.926 --> 00:27:59.167]  The phony green tyranny.
[00:27:59.167 --> 00:28:01.387]  The phony terror tyranny.
[00:28:01.387 --> 00:28:05.508]  The phony drug war tyranny.
[00:28:05.508 --> 00:28:06.949]  All of it.
[00:28:06.949 --> 00:28:10.549]  And I want to break down for people out there listening for the first time.
[00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:13.770]  We have tens of thousands that tune in for the first time every day.
[00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:15.751]  Just exactly what you face.
[00:28:15.751 --> 00:28:16.751]  What we face together.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:25.842]  And I want to explain to people that we're all in this together, whether you know it or not.
[00:28:25.842 --> 00:28:46.267]  And many of you that have chosen evil, who've lied to yourselves, and who are on the wrong side of history, you need to understand what is going to happen to you and what the next phase in this system
[00:28:47.955 --> 00:28:51.217]  is going to look like.
[00:28:51.217 --> 00:29:10.491]  I also have clearly analyzed over the last six months what the globalists are planning next.
[00:29:10.491 --> 00:29:15.335]  I don't know in what order they're going to play these cards, but I know what cards they hold in their fist.
[00:29:17.338 --> 00:29:21.462]  In their hand.
[00:29:21.462 --> 00:29:35.293]  And clearly, clearly, it is going to be an attempted assassination of Barack H. Obama.
[00:29:35.293 --> 00:29:40.938]  I am as sure of this as the sun coming up in the morning and setting in the evening.
[00:29:40.938 --> 00:29:43.841]  And coming up in one hour, I will break it down.
[00:29:44.884 --> 00:29:46.505]  News Blitz straight ahead.
[00:29:46.505 --> 00:29:50.888]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.888 --> 00:29:52.269]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:54.810]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:57.492]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:04.643]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.643 --> 00:30:05.544]  Number one.
[00:30:05.544 --> 00:30:08.966]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:08.966 --> 00:30:09.827]  Number two.
[00:30:09.827 --> 00:30:14.731]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.731 --> 00:30:15.471]  It's true.
[00:30:15.471 --> 00:30:20.335]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.335 --> 00:30:20.795]  Number three.
[00:30:21.155 --> 00:30:24.738]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.738 --> 00:30:29.442]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:29.442 --> 00:30:32.224]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.224 --> 00:30:35.546]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.667 --> 00:30:40.828]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:40.828 --> 00:30:45.869]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:45.869 --> 00:30:50.051]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:50.051 --> 00:30:51.831]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:51.831 --> 00:30:56.432]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:31:02.006 --> 00:31:06.051]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:06.051 --> 00:31:09.276]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:09.276 --> 00:31:10.698]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:31:11.391 --> 00:31:14.073]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:14.073 --> 00:31:20.459]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.459 --> 00:31:26.023]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:26.023 --> 00:31:35.651]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:35.771 --> 00:31:38.113]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:38.113 --> 00:31:39.694]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:39.694 --> 00:31:42.156]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:42.156 --> 00:31:44.298]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:44.298 --> 00:31:49.442]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:49.442 --> 00:31:54.446]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:31:54.446 --> 00:31:58.549]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:01.548 --> 00:32:02.348]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:32:02.348 --> 00:32:05.649]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:32:05.649 --> 00:32:10.931]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[00:32:10.931 --> 00:32:16.673]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[00:32:16.673 --> 00:32:24.275]  We would intend not to be standing in the bread line with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[00:32:24.275 --> 00:32:29.177]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the bread line may have no bread.
[00:32:29.793 --> 00:32:37.615]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[00:32:37.615 --> 00:32:42.716]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[00:32:42.716 --> 00:32:43.016]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:32:43.016 --> 00:32:43.096]  800-409-5633.
[00:32:43.096 --> 00:32:43.996]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:43.996 --> 00:32:44.216]  Who am I?
[00:32:44.216 --> 00:32:44.876]  Someone who cares.
[00:33:00.939 --> 00:33:10.225]  We don't need no education.
[00:33:10.225 --> 00:33:13.927]  We don't need no thought control.
[00:33:13.927 --> 00:33:30.158]  How are the global controllers, the world managers, going to contain and diffuse the legitimate global awakening to globalization and the new world order?
[00:33:32.005 --> 00:33:34.366]  They're going to do it with economic collapse.
[00:33:34.366 --> 00:33:39.530]  They're going to do it with national security staged crises.
[00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:53.978]  They're going to do it by divide and conquer, by new wars, and by, at the bare minimum, an attempted assassination attempt on Barack H. Obama.
[00:33:53.978 --> 00:33:56.400]  Coming up in one hour, I'm going to break that down.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.961]  I'm sure of it.
[00:33:58.961 --> 00:33:59.982]  I have seen the clear
[00:34:04.795 --> 00:34:10.599]  Pre-programming that the establishment is putting out.
[00:34:10.599 --> 00:34:19.947]  We're going to be running through all of this coming up today.
[00:34:19.947 --> 00:34:23.829]  Let me just read to you randomly.
[00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:26.471]  I'm just picking one of the stacks.
[00:34:26.471 --> 00:34:30.855]  Some of the headlines I have here in front of me that we will cover today, every single one of these articles.
[00:34:32.083 --> 00:34:38.168]  Aspartame has been renamed and is now being marketed as natural sweetener.
[00:34:38.168 --> 00:34:44.713]  That's up on InfoWars.com from Natural News.

[00:35:06.027 --> 00:35:06.947]  Why is that important?
[00:35:06.947 --> 00:35:09.368]  I'll tell you.
[00:35:09.368 --> 00:35:17.873]  UAH shooting suspect Amy Bishop, denied tenure in April, had already lost appeal.
[00:35:17.873 --> 00:35:19.334]  Familiar pattern.

[00:35:24.936 --> 00:35:27.758]  Israeli cult leader charged with enslavement and rape.
[00:35:30.708 --> 00:35:42.112]  That's just one of the stacks where I want to break the stories down and point out a larger picture.
[00:35:42.112 --> 00:35:44.012]  Here's another stack.
[00:35:44.012 --> 00:35:48.594]  Airport scanners may be unlawful, says UK government.
[00:35:50.623 --> 00:35:52.384]  There's another article.
[00:35:52.384 --> 00:35:54.466]  Collapse of Euro is inevitable.
[00:35:54.466 --> 00:35:55.987]  This is the mail.
[00:35:55.987 --> 00:36:00.491]  Bailing out the Greek economy futile, says French banking chief.
[00:36:00.491 --> 00:36:03.013]  Huge news.
[00:36:03.013 --> 00:36:07.997]  I could spend four hours on this alone.
[00:36:07.997 --> 00:36:11.860]  Spanish intelligence probing debt attacks report.
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.503]  Of course there's attacks on these economies that are causing this.
[00:36:14.503 --> 00:36:14.723]  Why?
[00:36:17.441 --> 00:36:19.602]  Another story here out of the London Telegraph.
[00:36:19.602 --> 00:36:24.705]  Control freaks want web licenses to end bloggers' anonymity.
[00:36:24.705 --> 00:36:29.008]  Be very afraid, is the headline.
[00:36:29.008 --> 00:36:34.591]  A story here out of Armed Females of America.
[00:36:34.591 --> 00:36:40.235]  The NRA horns in on Supreme Court gun case to sabotage it.
[00:36:44.494 --> 00:36:55.158]  Obama signs law raising public debt limit to $12.4 trillion to $14.3 trillion.
[00:36:55.158 --> 00:36:59.179]  In the news of Australia, Goldman Sachs accused of rigging tax vote.
[00:36:59.179 --> 00:37:06.322]  Of course they run the governments.
[00:37:06.322 --> 00:37:07.902]  Paul Craig Roberts, U.S.
[00:37:07.902 --> 00:37:08.902]  is now a police state.
[00:37:08.902 --> 00:37:11.423]  We're going to play that short video later.
[00:37:11.423 --> 00:37:13.204]  It dovetails with the Sky News piece.
[00:37:17.051 --> 00:37:17.832]  You're nicked!
[00:37:17.832 --> 00:37:25.278]  Police drone nabs its suspect with taser weapons.
[00:37:25.278 --> 00:37:26.639]  Times of London.
[00:37:26.639 --> 00:37:31.223]  Unlawful anti-terror powers planned for use during 2012 Olympics.
[00:37:31.223 --> 00:37:37.107]  It's already going on in Canada.
[00:37:37.107 --> 00:37:38.829]  Now to the most important stack.
[00:37:38.829 --> 00:37:41.431]  This is two stacks of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[00:37:49.432 --> 00:37:56.096]  Obama making plans to use executive power, New York Times.
[00:37:56.096 --> 00:38:13.647]  Off-the-charts article, and they report this open, Hitlerian, Stalinist, Maoist, whatever you like to call it, it's authoritarian development, like it's the local weather report, that it's going to be a balmy 70 degrees.
[00:38:15.225 --> 00:38:20.028]  Obama making plans to use executive power, and here are the stories, Kurt Nimmo, about it.
[00:38:20.028 --> 00:38:23.090]  Obama declares he will rule by authoritarian decree.
[00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:25.691]  That's mfowards.com.
[00:38:25.691 --> 00:38:27.512]  Here's a presentplanet.com article.
[00:38:27.512 --> 00:38:32.355]  Obama breaks yet another key campaign promise.
[00:38:32.355 --> 00:38:32.955]  Here's another one.
[00:38:32.955 --> 00:38:40.180]  Obama eyes executive orders to circumvent Congress on gun control, environment, borders,
[00:38:41.334 --> 00:38:43.215]  They don't care.
[00:38:43.215 --> 00:38:46.657]  And I'm going to explain later in the next hour why.
[00:38:46.657 --> 00:38:48.559]  They are holding him hostage.
[00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:52.361]  Not that he's a real president or a good guy.
[00:38:52.361 --> 00:38:58.705]  But he will do what he's told, just like George Bush or Bill Clinton or anybody else, because of all the dirt they've got on him.
[00:39:00.267 --> 00:39:13.353]  And the neocons are now openly threatening him through public channels, thinly veiled, that someone's going to try to assassinate him soon if he doesn't do what he's told and attack Iran.
[00:39:13.353 --> 00:39:20.756]  Obama knows this will politically destroy him, but they don't care.
[00:39:20.756 --> 00:39:24.118]  And all of you should take heed by this that serve the dark side.
[00:39:24.118 --> 00:39:26.859]  It will always destroy its minions.
[00:39:30.273 --> 00:39:34.537]  Of course, this dovetails with what's coming up with Obama.
[00:39:34.537 --> 00:39:37.120]  Glenn Beck is inexorably tied to this.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:42.965]  Palin Beck, Judas Goats Against the Freedom Movement.
[00:39:42.965 --> 00:39:44.447]  Another article.
[00:39:44.447 --> 00:39:49.652]  A familiar pattern with Glenn Beck.
[00:39:49.652 --> 00:39:51.774]  A message to Glenn Beck.
[00:39:51.774 --> 00:39:53.656]  What are the dangers of the 9-11 truthers?
[00:39:53.656 --> 00:39:54.757]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:39:55.894 --> 00:40:04.356]  A second Texas governor candidate also not sure on 9-11.
[00:40:04.356 --> 00:40:07.736]  Should the inquisition continue?
[00:40:07.736 --> 00:40:09.177]  See, that's their problem.
[00:40:09.177 --> 00:40:14.638]  Many polls show as high as 83 to 84 percent believing there's a cover-up with 9-11.
[00:40:14.638 --> 00:40:17.378]  This has mortally wounded the New World Order.
[00:40:17.378 --> 00:40:20.599]  That's why in internal White House documents from Bush and Obama,
[00:40:22.236 --> 00:40:42.194]  And in their corporate talking points, they say they've got to somehow reverse what 9-11 Truth has done because their favorite tool of stage terror has been damaged almost to the point of inoperability.
[00:40:42.194 --> 00:40:45.858]  But they're under the hood trying to fix their system.
[00:40:51.684 --> 00:40:59.490]  Another key article, manufactured controversy backfires as vast majority back Medina attack Glenn Beck.
[00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:07.297]  Dallas Morning News admitted they caught fake bloggers with Rick Perry's campaign in there posing as 9-11 truthers saying ridiculous things.
[00:41:07.297 --> 00:41:11.840]  They're doing it everywhere.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:15.763]  Perry's supporters caught posting fake ProMedina comments on Dallas Morning News.
[00:41:15.763 --> 00:41:16.444]  That's the headline.
[00:41:17.895 --> 00:41:19.836]  So that whole stack is coming up.
[00:41:19.836 --> 00:41:23.677]  The incredibly good news on ClimateGate.
[00:41:23.677 --> 00:41:34.960]  As I told you, this could be a death blow to their environmental cult movement to take over society and regulate and tax every facet of our lives, selectively.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:39.161]  The incredible king-making power this gives them.
[00:41:39.161 --> 00:41:44.462]  You have to have an imperial government mark to be able to do business.
[00:41:44.462 --> 00:41:47.043]  ClimateGate, you turn a scientist at center of
[00:41:48.712 --> 00:41:57.876]  Rowe Center of Controversy admits there has been no global warming since 1995.
[00:41:57.876 --> 00:42:00.497]  They've now been forced to release their actual raw data.
[00:42:00.497 --> 00:42:03.899]  As we told you, no warming since 95.
[00:42:03.899 --> 00:42:11.823]  Clear cooling the last nine years.
[00:42:11.823 --> 00:42:16.725]  They hope to defuse things now by just admitting they're a bunch of liars, but that won't work either.
[00:42:18.442 --> 00:42:22.043]  Utah delivers vote of no confidence for climate alarmist.
[00:42:22.043 --> 00:42:25.224]  I guarantee when we get the state rep on, he's going to be a listener.
[00:42:25.224 --> 00:42:41.549]  The original version of the bill dismissed climate science as a well-organized, this is a quote, an ongoing effort to manipulate and incorporate tricks related to global temperature data in order to produce global warming outcome.
[00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:46.931]  Representative Mike Noel said environmentalists were part of a vast conspiracy to destroy the American way of life.
[00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:51.131]  And control world population through forced sterilization and abortion.
[00:42:51.131 --> 00:43:13.761]  That's what the UN, and Maurice Strong, and all of these people, and the head climatologist for NASA, they all write, they all say, Prince Charles, Prince Philip, Ted Turner, Jacques Cousteau, United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment, they all say they want to destroy the industrialized society, and make you bankrupt so they can get you under government control.
[00:43:14.727 --> 00:43:15.807]  And make you dependent.
[00:43:15.807 --> 00:43:17.208]  They are the ones that say this.
[00:43:17.208 --> 00:43:20.108]  It's not us saying this.
[00:43:20.108 --> 00:43:21.229]  Yes, it's radical.
[00:43:21.229 --> 00:43:22.209]  Yes, it's crazy.
[00:43:22.209 --> 00:43:23.549]  Yes, it's evil.
[00:43:23.549 --> 00:43:27.790]  But we're not the crazies for reporting it.
[00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:29.591]  The truth is the truth.
[00:43:29.591 --> 00:43:34.652]  If 9-11's an inside job, and the evidence shows it's an inside job, then we expose it.
[00:43:34.652 --> 00:43:41.714]  If it shows that man isn't affecting the climate, and this is all a giant fraud to take over society, and the UN admits it, we report it.
[00:43:46.181 --> 00:44:05.196]  If Monsanto knew that more than half the monkeys they gave aspartame to died, and we know aspartame is a chemical weapon that brain damages you and attacks all the organs, we report on it!
[00:44:05.196 --> 00:44:14.384]  If scores of different varieties of GMO corn sterilize and attack the fertility and organs of mice and rats, we report it!
[00:44:16.314 --> 00:44:28.559]  See, I don't stick my finger up to the wind here and say, well, I'm gonna do what I think's popular.
[00:44:28.559 --> 00:44:43.206]  That's how you destroy your society, by making little compromises.
[00:44:43.206 --> 00:44:43.886]  And pretty soon,
[00:44:45.578 --> 00:44:48.760]  You've got 50 plus million aborted babies.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:56.824]  Pretty soon you've killed your entire next generation of workforce, so you've got to bring in 50 million illegal aliens and legals.
[00:44:56.824 --> 00:44:59.626]  30 plus million illegal over 20 million legals.
[00:44:59.626 --> 00:45:07.970]  Just in the last 20 years.
[00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:11.472]  You think it's fun having Newsweek attack me in last week's issue?
[00:45:15.353 --> 00:45:17.054]  Think it's fun to have that type of attention?
[00:45:17.054 --> 00:45:18.695]  This is not fun.
[00:45:18.695 --> 00:45:20.036]  This is duty.
[00:45:20.036 --> 00:45:25.540]  This is a last-ditch effort to throw myself in front of the machinery in the New World Order.
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:30.083]  And if more of you pile onto the machine, I guarantee you we can bring it down and stop it.
[00:45:30.083 --> 00:45:37.549]  Look at every case where we stand up and take action.
[00:45:37.549 --> 00:45:39.470]  The New World Order grinds to a halt.
[00:45:48.345 --> 00:46:03.138]  In fact, Paul Watson wrote a great story about this Newsweek article titled, Go Back to Sleep, There's No New World Order.
[00:46:03.138 --> 00:46:06.682]  Will you guys print me Go Back to Sleep, There's No New World Order?
[00:46:06.682 --> 00:46:09.124]  Jaron just walked in with this Newsweek article.
[00:46:09.124 --> 00:46:11.105]  I'd seen it on Friday.
[00:46:11.105 --> 00:46:13.568]  I just hadn't thought to cover it.
[00:46:13.568 --> 00:46:14.869]  It's important to get into later.
[00:46:27.133 --> 00:46:31.135]  Oh, this is a new Newsweek article they've written.
[00:46:31.135 --> 00:46:33.596]  They've written two?
[00:46:33.596 --> 00:46:36.898]  In the last week?
[00:46:36.898 --> 00:46:39.839]  My gosh!
[00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:42.721]  This is the second article attacking us?
[00:46:42.721 --> 00:46:46.243]  And I notice it always ties me to Glenn Beck.
[00:46:46.243 --> 00:46:54.407]  So that everybody who's awake to the New World Order and who reads this article will then go think Glenn Beck is good so he can Judas Goat them and slit their throats.
[00:46:56.169 --> 00:46:57.450]  That's what I mean, folks.
[00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:00.432]  This isn't a scripted show.
[00:47:00.432 --> 00:47:05.537]  I don't have 20 employees typing everything into a teleprompter I'm supposed to say on the radio and TV.
[00:47:05.537 --> 00:47:15.104]  I can't even keep track of the magnitude of this anymore.
[00:47:15.104 --> 00:47:18.347]  I'm here reading this new New York Times article and it's just all deception.
[00:47:28.733 --> 00:47:33.517]  Unbelievable.
[00:47:33.517 --> 00:47:50.151]  You know, I just want to run away to the mountains for like a year and just really have time to slow down, time to contemplate, time to get right with God.
[00:47:50.151 --> 00:47:55.275]  It is such a unbelievable thing
[00:47:56.929 --> 00:48:10.619]  To be legitimate, to be real, but to also be fleshly, worldly, to not be perfect, far from it, and to know I have this huge responsibility in front of me.
[00:48:10.619 --> 00:48:18.624]  To realize the magnitude of this in my place in history.
[00:48:18.624 --> 00:48:22.567]  Not that I care about myself in history, but I care how I will be used
[00:48:25.438 --> 00:48:36.427]  To discredit people, how they will distort who I am so that they can hurt those that we've awakened.
[00:48:36.427 --> 00:48:47.977]  Even if I watch my step, even if I can somehow find the intellect and the energy to navigate this archipelago of rocks, of shoals, of dangerous reefs,
[00:48:52.884 --> 00:49:03.487]  I just wish so many people weren't dumbed down and then so many others simply social climbers that would sell their family, their name, their country, their heritage out.
[00:49:03.487 --> 00:49:17.630]  People who revel in deceiving, people who revel in deception.
[00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:20.451]  We've woken up hundreds of millions of people conservatively.
[00:49:22.008 --> 00:49:32.130]  More than 80% of the folks that we talk to, or that other people we know talk to, say this radio show, my films, the websites woke them up.
[00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:44.693]  But I see so many people I initially wake up, then get caught in eddy pools and rat holes and rabbit trails.
[00:49:44.693 --> 00:49:46.433]  And God knows I've made a lot of mistakes.
[00:49:46.433 --> 00:49:48.233]  I haven't been perfect.
[00:49:48.233 --> 00:49:50.774]  And I understand it's a war and I can't get
[00:49:51.801 --> 00:50:21.490]  Over-analytical about myself, I just... The magnitude, the sheer scale of the evil, the lies, a society that lies and lies and lies and where we all lie to each other, our husbands, our wives, the frantic pace, the fast development of technology, everything.
[00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:34.696]  Careening towards Armageddon?
[00:50:34.696 --> 00:50:51.229]  All of the innocents who were tortured and maimed and crippled and destroyed by the New World Order and they just revel in this filthy cess like it's a stew.
[00:50:51.229 --> 00:50:54.731]  They have no conscience.
[00:50:54.731 --> 00:50:55.112]  To them,
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.221]  Evil and corruption is
[00:51:20.771 --> 00:51:26.937]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.
[00:51:26.937 --> 00:51:31.781]  From the smallest to the largest systems, BigBerkyWaterFilters.com has what you need.
[00:51:31.781 --> 00:51:38.227]  With your system purchase, you'll receive a shower filter, a fluoride filter, or two sport Berky bottles absolutely free.
[00:51:38.227 --> 00:51:44.553]  BigBerkyWaterFilters.com would like to offer GCN listeners 5% off all ceramic filter systems.
[00:51:44.893 --> 00:51:46.894]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:51:46.894 --> 00:51:49.175]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:51:49.175 --> 00:51:50.616]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:11.187 --> 00:52:13.849]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:13.849 --> 00:52:20.254]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.254 --> 00:52:25.618]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.618 --> 00:52:35.426]  All of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.546 --> 00:52:37.887]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:37.887 --> 00:52:39.467]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.467 --> 00:52:41.928]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:41.928 --> 00:52:44.049]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.049 --> 00:52:49.211]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:53:00.322 --> 00:53:02.743]  A revolution in smoking is underway.
[00:53:02.743 --> 00:53:06.604]  A revolution all smokers of traditional cigarettes should know about.

[00:53:18.848 --> 00:53:20.289]  True smoking freedom.

[00:53:57.723 --> 00:53:59.928]  The smoking gun heard round the world.
[00:54:26.759 --> 00:54:36.702]  Coming up, Barack Obama comes right out in the open and says he's going to rule by executive decree.
[00:54:36.702 --> 00:54:40.444]  And the controlled corporate press tells you it's legal and lawful.
[00:54:40.444 --> 00:54:54.128]  They're going to further bring in the Napa superhighways, get rid of the borders, come after the Second Amendment, launch new wars, expand secret arrest and torture, the federalization of local police, the takeover of the internet,
[00:54:56.069 --> 00:55:00.352]  We are getting deep into the global system right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:00.352 --> 00:55:10.180]  I'm also going to break down the two Newsweek hit pieces on myself in one week.
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:19.168]  We're going to break down the fact that I am 100% clear, just like I was 100% clear they were going to stage an attack on the World Trade Centers.
[00:55:21.621 --> 00:55:30.104]  Months before it happened, I was 100% clear they were going to launch a flu hysteria in January of last year, three months before they launched the operation.
[00:55:30.104 --> 00:55:46.669]  I am 100% clear, in my mind, in the still of the night, when I have all of my intellect, that they are going to stage a false flag on Obama.
[00:55:48.112 --> 00:55:57.978]  I believe that is the next card, and the enemy has tipped their hand.
[00:55:57.978 --> 00:56:08.904]  So that is coming up as well, and yes, I'll get into what happened late last week with Debra Medina on the Dark Ones radio show.
[00:56:10.609 --> 00:56:28.944]  Proving again at key points when Ron Paul had a chance to win the primary, he came out and told his 10 million listeners on radio, his 2 million on TV at the time, now it's 5 million on TV, 4 million, that Ron Paul was a kook and dangerous and evil and a 9-11 truther.
[00:56:28.944 --> 00:56:33.889]  He's now done it to Medina, backing Rick Perry, who
[00:56:35.953 --> 00:56:41.095]  Maybe from West Texas, a son of a cotton farmer, but he's pure New World Order by his actions.
[00:56:41.095 --> 00:56:44.836]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:56:44.836 --> 00:56:48.157]  Have we forgotten he's the one that brought us the Trans-Texas Highway?
[00:56:48.157 --> 00:56:52.218]  The takeover of 8,000 miles of roads?
[00:56:52.218 --> 00:56:55.699]  Then last year, when we were beating them, they said, OK, don't worry, we're not going to do it now.
[00:56:55.699 --> 00:56:59.040]  They just stopped calling it the Trans-Texas Corridor and all the toll roads are going in.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:05.202]  I mean, just anywhere where there's a close balance between us winning and losing,
[00:57:06.024 --> 00:57:09.325]  Glenn Beck rushes in and throws his full weight on the side of the New World Order.
[00:57:09.325 --> 00:57:10.466]  Every time!
[00:57:10.466 --> 00:57:15.987]  I mean, do you have any discernment, some of you out there?
[00:57:15.987 --> 00:57:20.029]  Any discernment?
[00:57:20.029 --> 00:57:29.492]  I mean, at least Michael Savage will admit that Obama will stage terror attacks, and that if they push Sarah Palin for 2012, that they're gonna lose, and that she's a ringer for Obama.
[00:57:29.492 --> 00:57:34.093]  I mean, anyone with a moron's understanding of politics would know that.
[00:57:34.093 --> 00:57:35.554]  And so you gotta give credit where it's due.
[00:57:36.684 --> 00:57:45.746]  On every point, Glenn Beck is a demon.
[00:57:45.746 --> 00:57:51.387]  I don't want to attack him.
[00:57:51.387 --> 00:57:59.589]  But my discernment, my gut, my intellect, my research tells me he is at a key juncture point in our resistance movement.
[00:57:59.589 --> 00:58:01.790]  He is Benedict Arnold.
[00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:03.210]  He is Judas Iscariot.
[00:58:06.021 --> 00:58:08.822]  And he will lead us to destruction.
[00:58:08.822 --> 00:58:17.003]  Just as Barack Obama will lead you to destruction.
[00:58:17.003 --> 00:58:25.105]  When Medina was gaining five points a week, he came in and strafed her.
[00:58:25.105 --> 00:58:27.886]  And it's still not clear whether it was a death blow.
[00:58:32.825 --> 00:58:40.788]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be opening the phones up in the next hour, and I'm going to break down the next false flag.
[00:58:40.788 --> 00:58:46.490]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:49.691]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:52.179 --> 00:58:56.160]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:59:05.001]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:59:05.001 --> 00:59:09.642]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:59:09.642 --> 00:59:20.464]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:59:21.084 --> 00:59:30.607]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:30.607 --> 00:59:36.029]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:59:36.029 --> 00:59:43.512]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:43.512 --> 00:59:46.273]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:59:53.542 --> 00:59:55.944]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.944 --> 01:00:05.149]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.149 --> 01:00:06.450]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:08.231]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.231 --> 01:00:09.972]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.972 --> 01:00:11.574]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.574 --> 01:00:13.135]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.135 --> 01:00:17.317]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.317 --> 01:00:21.380]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.098 --> 01:00:30.279]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we're now into the second hour, coming up in 30 minutes.
[01:00:30.279 --> 01:00:39.622]  We're going to simulcast the last two and a half hours of the radio show via the television transmission at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:39.622 --> 01:00:41.962]  All my films are posted there in super high quality.
[01:00:41.962 --> 01:00:43.723]  My book, Paul Watson's book, his e-books.
[01:00:44.503 --> 01:01:00.012]  Hundreds and hundreds, I guess it's got to be thousands of radio shows and higher quality podcasts and mp3s, as well as now, I guess it's got to be close to 800, 900 TV shows archived there, going back over years.
[01:01:00.012 --> 01:01:07.157]  Every day we did the live transmission, simulcast, we then saved that, the archived video of that for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:11.619]  Fifteen cents a day.
[01:01:11.619 --> 01:01:15.281]  And that funds much of our operation and it's a great activist tool.
[01:01:15.281 --> 01:01:27.926]  If you hear a particular guest on any one of hundreds of important subjects, you can go download it, the video, the audio, burn it to disk, email it to people, get the word out on any subject that you want to inform someone with.
[01:01:29.361 --> 01:01:30.862]  All at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:01:30.862 --> 01:01:44.669]  $5.95 to get a trial monthly membership or go ahead and get a year and get three months free, a three month discount free at PrisonPlanet.tv and I do want to thank all the members of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:01:44.669 --> 01:01:46.770]  Also, don't forget we have the free
[01:01:49.753 --> 01:02:14.501]  iPhone app, there's banners up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com or you can go to the radio listen page link at the top of InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and go to the iTunes store if you have a Apple device and it's got a lot of different little functions and things we're going to be adding some more to it but you can listen to the show when you're on the road and most importantly let's say you're already listening on AM FM shortwave satellite
[01:02:16.425 --> 01:02:19.387]  But you have a lot of friends and family that are iPhone users.
[01:02:19.387 --> 01:02:30.433]  Send them the link that we have a link to on the websites to the sub page of the iTunes where they can download it for free.
[01:02:30.433 --> 01:02:41.879]  And you got friends, family, neighbors, children, a boss, employees, an email list, a MySpace, a Facebook, a Twitter account.
[01:02:41.879 --> 01:02:44.381]  Please send out the free
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:53.204]  iPhone app to everyone you know, and do it once a week or so.
[01:02:53.204 --> 01:02:54.845]  Think about it.
[01:02:54.845 --> 01:03:02.770]  Someone can listen, even if there's not an AM or FM in your area, or even if it's too much information to go to amfowars.com and find the free streams.
[01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:11.975]  You can simply send them the free iPhone app link and say, check out this radio show, if you want to know the rest of the story.
[01:03:11.975 --> 01:03:16.098]  If you want to go deeper down the proverbial rabbit hole.
[01:03:16.991 --> 01:03:22.736]  PrisonPlanet.tv also has a link to the free app.
[01:03:22.736 --> 01:03:25.239]  We're developing an app for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:03:25.239 --> 01:03:27.061]  Just want to let you know that as well.
[01:03:27.061 --> 01:03:30.564]  We're going to come back, take your calls, and get into all the news.
[01:03:30.564 --> 01:03:33.286]  And I'm going to talk about the next phase.
[01:03:33.286 --> 01:03:36.850]  One of the key cards, the new order, will clearly play.
[01:03:36.850 --> 01:03:37.831]  This is a prediction.
[01:03:39.281 --> 01:03:47.884]  Now obviously, I make the prediction so that we can get the word out and so that it's on record so that if they do play the card it blows up in their face.
[01:03:47.884 --> 01:03:51.184]  And that is they will attempt and may be successful.
[01:03:51.184 --> 01:03:57.246]  It may be a staged attempt where they don't intend to kill him or they may try to kill him and not be successful or they may kill him.
[01:03:57.246 --> 01:04:01.768]  That's President Barack Obama.
[01:04:01.768 --> 01:04:04.148]  And that is the last thing anyone wants.
[01:04:04.148 --> 01:04:06.409]  He is a puppet, a teleprompter reading lawyer.
[01:04:09.207 --> 01:04:14.673]  Also, the books are in, but I can't ship them quite yet, but notice it's already the 15th of the month.
[01:04:14.673 --> 01:04:16.876]  We can ship these out to you in early March.
[01:04:16.876 --> 01:04:17.817]  Jesse Venturas.
[01:04:19.133 --> 01:04:23.516]  New book, New York Times best-selling author, Jesse Ventura, American Conspiracies.

[01:04:41.468 --> 01:04:43.330]  And supplies of these will not last.

[01:04:52.298 --> 01:04:53.719]  That's 75% off.

[01:05:01.764 --> 01:05:05.405]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:05:05.405 --> 01:05:09.026]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:05:09.026 --> 01:05:13.807]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:05:13.807 --> 01:05:20.209]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:05:20.209 --> 01:05:22.450]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:23.290]  Tim Geithner?
[01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:23.790]  Bernanke?
[01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:24.591]  They're arsonists!
[01:05:24.591 --> 01:05:25.771]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:05:25.771 --> 01:05:27.992]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:05:41.877 --> 01:05:49.165]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:06:00.482 --> 01:06:05.809]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:06:05.809 --> 01:06:08.553]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:06:08.553 --> 01:06:12.859]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:06:15.282 --> 01:06:18.345]  Order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.
[01:06:18.345 --> 01:06:23.369]  We also have some specials where you can get some of our other films half price when you order Shadow Government.

[01:07:00.919 --> 01:07:03.920]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:09.261]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:07:09.261 --> 01:07:11.302]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:07:11.302 --> 01:07:16.304]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:07:16.304 --> 01:07:17.484]  How much do you want?
[01:07:17.484 --> 01:07:18.604]  When do you want it?
[01:07:18.604 --> 01:07:20.485]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:07:20.485 --> 01:07:21.565]  When will you need it?
[01:07:21.565 --> 01:07:23.766]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:07:23.766 --> 01:07:25.106]  Will there be any food?
[01:07:25.106 --> 01:07:26.627]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:07:26.627 --> 01:07:27.687]  If there's a quarantine,
[01:07:27.847 --> 01:07:29.169]  And you can't feed yourself?
[01:07:29.169 --> 01:07:31.893]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:07:31.893 --> 01:07:35.478]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:07:35.478 --> 01:07:39.304]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:07:39.304 --> 01:07:40.545]  How much will you need?
[01:07:40.545 --> 01:07:41.447]  We don't know.
[01:07:41.447 --> 01:07:42.548]  How much do you want?
[01:07:42.548 --> 01:07:43.289]  All you can get.
[01:07:43.289 --> 01:07:44.291]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:07:44.551 --> 01:07:47.613]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:07:47.613 --> 01:07:49.815]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:49.815 --> 01:07:50.876]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:07:50.876 --> 01:07:53.838]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.628 --> 01:08:19.912]  Coming up, I'm going to break down the two different Newsweek hit pieces on myself and others.
[01:08:19.912 --> 01:08:28.717]  Also, the attack by Glenn Beck on the Republican Party against Debra Medina.
[01:08:28.717 --> 01:08:33.240]  Obama making plans to use executive power.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.481]  Absolutely key.
[01:08:35.481 --> 01:08:36.421]  That is coming up.
[01:08:36.421 --> 01:08:38.943]  But I want to go to your phone calls now.
[01:08:40.543 --> 01:08:42.245]  And throughout the broadcast today.
[01:08:42.245 --> 01:08:48.232]  Yes, we have a lot of very informative guests coming up throughout the week.
[01:08:48.232 --> 01:08:54.560]  But today we have cleared the deck so that we can cover all the news and take your phone calls.
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.161]  Let's talk to Matt in Ohio.
[01:08:56.161 --> 01:08:58.564]  Matt, you're on the air.
[01:08:58.564 --> 01:09:00.146]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:09:00.146 --> 01:09:00.767]  Thanks for calling.
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:12.944]  I just wanted to, you mentioned that you were going to bring it up a little bit later on, but I wanted to, if it's not jumping the gun, get your take on Glenn Beck's interview.
[01:09:12.944 --> 01:09:24.928]  And then also, I just mentioned that I had seen a couple articles indicating that it may be backfiring, that there was a radio show, I think in Texas,
[01:09:25.803 --> 01:09:35.252]  Where the host was taking in callers trying to see if anybody changed their mind about voting for Medina and I think every single caller said that.
[01:09:35.252 --> 01:09:46.503]  Yeah, we posted, that's a station Becca's on in Dallas, we posted quite a few different radio links where almost every caller was calling in
[01:09:47.822 --> 01:09:48.643]  Disagreeing
[01:10:06.889 --> 01:10:12.233]  But the national media makes fun of us talking about him being a Bilderberg Group attendee.
[01:10:12.233 --> 01:10:15.295]  That was in the Dallas Morning News and News 8 Austin.
[01:10:15.295 --> 01:10:16.215]  And it was illegal.
[01:10:16.215 --> 01:10:18.537]  It was a violation of the Logan Act.
[01:10:18.537 --> 01:10:23.780]  And yes, that has backfired to a certain extent.
[01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:28.223]  But she was gaining around five points a week.
[01:10:28.223 --> 01:10:30.264]  We'll see what happens.
[01:10:30.264 --> 01:10:34.327]  But overall, she already had the Patriots supporting her.
[01:10:35.259 --> 01:10:42.125]  And see, what this does is shatter the illusion that it's a Democratic partisan thing to be a 9-11 truther.
[01:10:42.125 --> 01:10:47.410]  And sure, there are a lot of Democrats who were just Bush haters, so they looked at the 9-11 truth.
[01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:52.435]  And with the WMD lies and all the rest of it, you know, they saw the evidence.
[01:10:53.345 --> 01:10:59.332]  But now Obama's continuing the wars, continuing the torture, and so they've kind of shut down on that issue.
[01:10:59.332 --> 01:11:10.764]  But it was, from the beginning, mainly true libertarians, constitutionalists, who value the truth above partisanship, who went and looked at the evidence of 9-11, and clearly it was an inside job.
[01:11:10.764 --> 01:11:14.988]  And so you have the Democratic candidate, one of the main Democratic candidates, saying
[01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:18.870]  Looks like an inside job, going further than even Medina.
[01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:27.894]  You've got her saying, well, people have a right to their opinion, and you know, six of the ten 9-11 Commission members say it's a cover-up, and there should be a new investigation.
[01:11:27.894 --> 01:11:42.460]  So, again, it shows that it's a non-partisan issue, that you've got a lot of Medina supporters who are 9-11 truthers, or who at least don't trust the official government story, and you've got the main Democratic candidate coming out and saying even more.
[01:11:43.543 --> 01:11:47.528]  Uh, and saying that, well, we don't know what happened with 9-11.
[01:11:47.528 --> 01:11:48.589]  There are a lot of questions.
[01:11:48.589 --> 01:11:49.851]  It could be an inside job.
[01:11:51.809 --> 01:11:54.931]  Continuing to show that this really is the majority view.
[01:11:54.931 --> 01:11:57.812]  I mean, people have now seen Building 7 fall.
[01:11:57.812 --> 01:12:03.635]  They now know about the CIA drills on the morning of 9-11, of the same targets being attacked at the same time.
[01:12:03.635 --> 01:12:05.716]  They know about the NORAD stand-down.
[01:12:05.716 --> 01:12:11.558]  They know that 15 of the 19 supposed hijackers came from Saudi Arabia, but we attacked Iraq.
[01:12:11.558 --> 01:12:17.401]  They know that the hijackers were trained in spy training in Florida and in California.
[01:12:17.401 --> 01:12:19.582]  That's mainstream news.
[01:12:19.582 --> 01:12:20.883]  They know that and so
[01:12:22.559 --> 01:12:27.961]  They don't come out and say, we know it's an inside job, but they say, well, it sure is reasonable to ask questions.
[01:12:27.961 --> 01:12:38.165]  And now, a lot of Americans know about Mr. Farmer, the head counsel for the 9-11 Commission, saying there was a conspiracy, a criminal cover-up of what really happened by the Pentagon and the Justice Department.
[01:12:38.165 --> 01:12:44.027]  And they know six of the ten members have come out and said that Cheney was giving basically a stand-down order.
[01:12:46.488 --> 01:12:49.290]  It's legitimate to talk about staged terror.
[01:12:49.290 --> 01:12:54.014]  I mean, most conservatives know that Bill Clinton staged Oklahoma City.
[01:12:54.014 --> 01:13:01.440]  And so it's not a stretch to know that Bush or his handlers were involved, Matt, but I appreciate your call.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:05.183]  And yes, I'm going to talk about that coming up in the next hour.
[01:13:05.183 --> 01:13:07.725]  Let's go to Justin in West Virginia.
[01:13:07.725 --> 01:13:08.766]  Justin, you're on the air.
[01:13:08.766 --> 01:13:10.387]  Go ahead.
[01:13:10.387 --> 01:13:11.708]  Hey, Alex.
[01:13:11.708 --> 01:13:13.289]  I had two questions.
[01:13:14.981 --> 01:13:18.883]  One, you were talking about the aspartame natural sweetener.
[01:13:18.883 --> 01:13:32.089]  I was wondering what's a good article you would recommend that I can show my friends about the aspartame because they don't believe me about it and they just keep drinking all their diet sodas.
[01:13:32.089 --> 01:13:42.114]  Well, I mean if your friends don't want to research it for themselves, I don't, I mean we don't pre-screen your calls so I don't have an article
[01:13:43.433 --> 01:13:45.954]  Actually, I do have an article on it here in front of me.
[01:13:45.954 --> 01:13:54.078]  But I suggest they just search engine the aspartame manufacturing process.
[01:13:54.078 --> 01:13:57.299]  And if you tell them, tell them, hey, I'll bet you $100.
[01:13:57.299 --> 01:14:05.123]  I'm not a betting man, but I will bet occasionally just to show somebody up, you know, to get them to admit they're wrong, because then they may go check it to try to collect $100.
[01:14:06.385 --> 01:14:14.668]  Or if I'm on the air with a talk show host and they say, there's no such thing as Operation Northwoods, there's no ABC News article saying U.S.
[01:14:14.668 --> 01:14:17.329]  government plan to stage terror attacks in U.S.
[01:14:17.329 --> 01:14:19.309]  cities as pretext for war.
[01:14:19.309 --> 01:14:24.411]  And I'll say, $10,000, right now, pal, put your money where your mouth is.
[01:14:25.231 --> 01:14:29.553]  And then ten minutes later, a caller calls in and goes, wow, I googled it, here it is!
[01:14:29.553 --> 01:14:36.455]  Baltimore Sun, AP, ABC News, wow, I didn't know this, so I'm really talking to the audience.
[01:14:36.455 --> 01:14:38.696]  I'm going to get them to go look it up.
[01:14:38.696 --> 01:14:40.036]  And it's kind of like a football game.
[01:14:40.036 --> 01:14:42.737]  A lot of adults only watch football because they're betting on it.
[01:14:42.737 --> 01:14:44.938]  If they hear there's a bet involved, they'll go look.
[01:14:44.938 --> 01:14:51.240]  But of course, the talk show host generally is just some kind of minion and knows it's the truth and will say, no, I'm not going to bet you, kook.
[01:14:53.101 --> 01:15:12.437]  But you tell them, hey, did you know aspartame is a genetically engineered E. coli, that's a feces-eating bacteria, did you know that this dirty bacteria has been genetically engineered to eat toxic chemicals that they feed it and then they excrete aspartame?
[01:15:12.437 --> 01:15:15.459]  And they'll say, that's ridiculous, that's crazy.
[01:15:15.459 --> 01:15:16.300]  And then you go, okay, $100.
[01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:22.837]  And they will probably bet you, and then they're going to try to get out of the $100, but at least you've woken them up.
[01:15:22.837 --> 01:15:34.932]  You know, the goal wasn't to get $100, and then they will go online and see major universities, and you can even find photographs and videos of it, the black sludge, and it is bacteria feces.
[01:15:36.132 --> 01:15:37.053]  Okay?
[01:15:37.053 --> 01:15:45.159]  Now, what makes you get sick with most forms of food poisoning when they have, there's many different varieties of bacteria?
[01:15:45.159 --> 01:15:52.084]  It isn't the bacteria generally, there's a few infections that do this, that make you sick.
[01:15:52.084 --> 01:15:53.245]  Okay?
[01:15:53.245 --> 01:15:56.107]  It is their excretion.
[01:15:56.107 --> 01:15:58.449]  It's the toxins.
[01:15:58.449 --> 01:15:59.250]  It's what they pass.
[01:16:00.575 --> 01:16:10.421]  Okay, that's what, with the most common forms of food poisoning, that's what's really making you sick, not the bacteria.
[01:16:10.421 --> 01:16:11.782]  It's what they've excreted.
[01:16:11.782 --> 01:16:29.313]  And then say, so wait a minute, the same bacteria's excretion that gives you food poisoning, a similar type of bacteria excretion, is what tastes sweet and is 62 times sweeter per gram than pure cane sugar, for example.
[01:16:30.168 --> 01:16:33.822]  Now say, is toxic bacteria
[01:16:34.926 --> 01:16:37.447]  Feces, good.
[01:16:37.447 --> 01:16:45.011]  And then take them to the store, to saving somebody's life potentially is worth it, and say, find me a gum here.
[01:16:45.011 --> 01:16:56.277]  I mean, you, folks, I go to Walgreens, I go to H-E-B, I go to the Candy Isle, and you literally cannot find gum.
[01:16:56.277 --> 01:16:59.879]  Paul Watson chews gum, he had to order it specially online in England.
[01:16:59.879 --> 01:17:01.520]  This only happened three years ago.
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:03.181]  You cannot find gum.
[01:17:04.969 --> 01:17:20.235]  Even when it's not sugarless, regular sugar gum, and it will say sugar, corn syrup, and then it will say, under it, Aspartame, or the new name that I'm seeing everywhere, Aminosweet.
[01:17:20.235 --> 01:17:22.196]  Aminosweet.
[01:17:22.196 --> 01:17:29.399]  They know everything Monsanto does in all the major studies hurts life forms, hurts mammals.
[01:17:29.399 --> 01:17:31.659]  This is done by design, there's no other way.
[01:17:31.659 --> 01:17:33.000]  Everything they put out is bad.
[01:17:34.454 --> 01:17:41.876]  It doesn't matter if it's Agent Orange or these different varieties of corn that have the pesticide that grows in it so the bugs can't eat it.
[01:17:41.876 --> 01:17:43.597]  I mean, come on, folks, it's a no-brainer.
[01:17:43.597 --> 01:17:45.877]  It kills bugs, but you're supposed to eat it.
[01:17:45.877 --> 01:17:51.559]  And then all their own studies show it attacks the organs of the rats and guinea pigs they give it to.
[01:17:51.559 --> 01:17:55.160]  So there's a great natural news story out today.
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:58.301]  We've got it up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:17:58.301 --> 01:18:02.282]  Aspartame has been renamed and is now being marketed
[01:18:03.689 --> 01:18:05.890]  As a natural sweetener.
[01:18:05.890 --> 01:18:17.112]  And then this article has a big list at the bottom of science sites and research sites that show all the actual research on it.
[01:18:17.112 --> 01:18:19.613]  But, I mean, it's an absolute fact.
[01:18:19.613 --> 01:18:26.375]  So, that's how you reach out to your friends.
[01:18:26.375 --> 01:18:30.936]  And then go on further saying, well, could all these doctors and scientists and researchers and their own
[01:18:31.874 --> 01:18:39.262]  When Rumsfeld was the head of Searle, that was a division of Monsanto in the 70s, and then in 1981 when they got it approved.
[01:18:39.262 --> 01:18:43.807]  If we're just up here lying that this attacks your brain and your body, why don't they sue us?
[01:18:43.807 --> 01:18:45.008]  Well, they can't.
[01:18:45.008 --> 01:18:46.389]  This is admitted.
[01:18:46.389 --> 01:18:49.673]  So, explain that to them.
[01:18:49.673 --> 01:18:50.514]  Does that answer your question?
[01:18:51.877 --> 01:18:57.719]  Yeah, and real quickly, I was just confused about the Obama deficit.
[01:18:57.719 --> 01:19:02.821]  It said something about it was going up to 14, but I thought it was 23.7 trillion.
[01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:04.521]  I'm kind of confused about that.
[01:19:04.521 --> 01:19:06.022]  Okay.
[01:19:06.022 --> 01:19:07.022]  That is separate.
[01:19:07.022 --> 01:19:10.223]  Well, I mean, have you seen us play the MSNBC where they show the number 23.7?
[01:19:10.223 --> 01:19:13.164]  Yeah, I have that saved.
[01:19:13.164 --> 01:19:17.386]  Well, you can go get it from Bloomberg as well.
[01:19:17.386 --> 01:19:20.427]  The 700 billion is a revolving open window.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:26.045]  Then that's in congressional testimony, that's in the fall of the republic.
[01:19:26.045 --> 01:19:28.027]  But that itself is separate.
[01:19:28.027 --> 01:19:31.571]  That's only about two and a half billion they've gotten from that open window there.
[01:19:31.571 --> 01:19:37.297]  They have the other Federal Reserve open window where the banks just get whatever they want from themselves.
[01:19:37.297 --> 01:19:40.981]  The Federal Reserve is their holding company and then it just gives them whatever they want.
[01:19:43.064 --> 01:19:46.566]  And when I say $28 trillion, that's a two, three-month-old number.
[01:19:46.566 --> 01:19:48.666]  It was $23.7 trillion six months ago.
[01:19:48.666 --> 01:19:50.987]  It was over $28 trillion a couple months ago.
[01:19:50.987 --> 01:19:53.729]  It's well over $30 trillion now.
[01:19:53.729 --> 01:19:55.709]  And then that's currently what they've taken.
[01:19:55.709 --> 01:19:57.330]  Then you've got to pay interest on that.
[01:19:57.330 --> 01:19:59.311]  You pay the bank's interest on money we give them.
[01:20:01.488 --> 01:20:06.089]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[01:22:01.002 --> 01:22:11.026]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:22:11.026 --> 01:22:17.469]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:22:17.469 --> 01:22:26.313]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:22:26.693 --> 01:22:35.880]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:40.483]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:22:40.483 --> 01:22:42.304]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:42.304 --> 01:22:44.786]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:04.533]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:23:04.533 --> 01:23:06.815]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:07.676]  Don't!
[01:23:07.676 --> 01:23:11.119]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:23:11.119 --> 01:23:20.206]  Why pay, when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[01:23:20.206 --> 01:23:24.310]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.

[01:23:28.553 --> 01:23:34.802]  Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:23:34.802 --> 01:23:35.984]  Herb K. was right.
[01:23:35.984 --> 01:23:39.169]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:23:39.169 --> 01:23:40.531]  What have you got to lose?
[01:23:40.531 --> 01:23:43.656]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money!
[01:23:44.216 --> 01:23:44.937]  Get Herb K.'
[01:23:44.877 --> 01:23:47.539]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now!

[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:48.720]  888-352-7726.
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:49.280]  Is it getting better?
[01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:22.486]  Or do you feel the same?
[01:24:22.486 --> 01:24:24.788]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[01:24:24.788 --> 01:24:32.817]  You've got someone to blame You said one love
[01:24:41.054 --> 01:24:41.995]  We are back live.
[01:24:41.995 --> 01:24:43.335]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:24:43.335 --> 01:25:03.886]  We're just a few minutes away from my breakdown of the fact that the establishment is clearly preparing and threatening Obama with some type of assassination attempt if he doesn't play ball.
[01:25:06.869 --> 01:25:14.211]  But Obama knows it will further destroy his political fortunes, but he's being told, do it or it's over.
[01:25:14.211 --> 01:25:16.212]  That is coming up in the next segment.
[01:25:16.212 --> 01:25:19.193]  Bob and P.A., you're on the air.
[01:25:19.193 --> 01:25:20.073]  Good day to you, Alex.
[01:25:20.073 --> 01:25:21.293]  How you doing?
[01:25:21.293 --> 01:25:21.573]  Doing alright.
[01:25:21.573 --> 01:25:23.014]  I'm trying to give you a call.
[01:25:23.014 --> 01:25:24.514]  A couple things.
[01:25:24.514 --> 01:25:26.655]  I just wanted to run by you, you know.
[01:25:26.655 --> 01:25:30.756]  I know a lot of people call and try to give you a lot of advice and all that.
[01:25:30.756 --> 01:25:32.016]  I really don't want to do that.
[01:25:32.016 --> 01:25:34.757]  I just was, after watching a lot of your films,
[01:25:35.706 --> 01:25:41.047]  And all the information, I'm certainly learning a lot, being able to pass that on.
[01:25:41.047 --> 01:25:51.210]  And it's just so surprising to the people that just, after they see it, they're still kind of like some, a few people, like in denial of the whole thing.
[01:25:51.210 --> 01:25:56.351]  And so, I was thinking, you know the saying, the way to a man's heart is through his stomach.
[01:25:56.351 --> 01:26:03.773]  All the stuff you have out, I'd love to see something like, if you could do something just totally unlike the food and the water.
[01:26:04.298 --> 01:26:13.405]  Because I think people would really, really... That would just get their attention so much more because they, you know... Well, your wish is my command.
[01:26:13.405 --> 01:26:16.567]  That's actually more than half the next film.
[01:26:16.567 --> 01:26:22.111]  The one we're working on right now is about that.
[01:26:22.111 --> 01:26:31.978]  Yeah, I figured you would probably already add it, but just wanted to mention that because I just think the information that you put out and all the stuff is just so valuable and people need this.
[01:26:32.602 --> 01:26:35.443]  You know, we're just full of so much entertainment.
[01:26:35.443 --> 01:26:41.826]  I think if there was no television or if there was some kind of blackout, people would just... it's a whole different lifestyle.
[01:26:41.826 --> 01:26:50.471]  And there's just so much entertainment out there, and people are just so dumbed down from everything else around them, like you said, and how they play into that.
[01:26:50.471 --> 01:26:52.932]  But anyway, a couple other things real quick.
[01:26:52.932 --> 01:26:57.274]  Um, I don't know if you heard about this, but last week, Rick Purry,
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:09.085]  Showed up on some Christian network station, and he's sitting there with these Christian guys, passing himself off as like, this great Christian guy, and all I could think of was you, and the stuff I saw about him.
[01:27:09.085 --> 01:27:13.927]  I was like, man, the people are just sitting there buying right into it, you know?
[01:27:13.927 --> 01:27:17.049]  I was like, I was wondering if you saw that or heard about that.
[01:27:17.532 --> 01:27:20.253]  Yeah, Rick Perry is a total chameleon.
[01:27:20.253 --> 01:27:23.915]  He has little outfits, different little outfits he wears.
[01:27:23.915 --> 01:27:30.098]  He plays the part of the rancher, and the part of the gun owner, and the part of the Christian, and the guy fighting the NAFTA highways.
[01:27:30.098 --> 01:27:33.600]  He's gonna stop them when he's the one that always vetoes it to let it through.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:35.161]  I mean, he is just a chameleon.
[01:27:35.161 --> 01:27:36.622]  He passed all these new taxes.
[01:27:38.266 --> 01:27:40.687]  He's just a complete monster.
[01:27:40.687 --> 01:27:44.750]  But people like to feel good and hear a Texas accent.
[01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:47.351]  I'm going to stop that Medina.
[01:27:47.351 --> 01:27:52.654]  Glenn Beck says I need to be for Rick Perry.
[01:27:52.654 --> 01:27:53.774]  And that's why they're slaves.
[01:27:53.774 --> 01:27:55.215]  That's why they're going to lose everything they've got.
[01:27:55.215 --> 01:27:56.696]  I appreciate your call, Bob.
[01:27:56.696 --> 01:27:58.097]  Let's jam in one more.
[01:27:58.097 --> 01:28:00.118]  Leif in Montana, you're on the air.
[01:28:00.118 --> 01:28:02.339]  Hi, how you doing?
[01:28:02.339 --> 01:28:02.599]  Good.
[01:28:03.536 --> 01:28:06.858]  Hey, I read an article the other day in the Billings Gazette and I thought I'd touch on it.
[01:28:06.858 --> 01:28:08.458]  It's about the healthcare.
[01:28:08.458 --> 01:28:08.738]  Yes.
[01:28:08.738 --> 01:28:13.901]  How none of the money is going to cure or cause, it's all to medicate the symptoms.
[01:28:15.069 --> 01:28:16.110]  Yes, they're shifting.
[01:28:16.110 --> 01:28:19.372]  When I say they're going to give you an aspirin for a heart attack, that's like Cuba.
[01:28:19.372 --> 01:28:25.015]  Oh, everybody gets free health care, but you literally get horrible health care, and that's in the bill.
[01:28:25.015 --> 01:28:33.420]  It cuts Medicare and Medicaid and raises all these new taxes, and the government sets the policies for doctors of what type of care they can give.
[01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:34.881]  It's a gift to the HMOs.
[01:28:34.881 --> 01:28:38.383]  Liability protection, cost-cutting, it's just a complete fraud.
[01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:46.971]  What this lady had to say was with no prevention, it will bankrupt us not only financially, but in the workforce also.
[01:28:46.971 --> 01:28:55.174]  As we treat the symptoms and let the people die, the new people, because we don't have anything in our food anymore, we'll have the same problems in our workforce.
[01:28:55.174 --> 01:28:57.895]  We'll almost be nil.
[01:28:57.895 --> 01:29:05.457]  You know, what she said was diseases come from a deficiency in our food, and that deficiency isn't drugs.
[01:29:06.482 --> 01:29:16.764]  Well, from all the scientific evidence I've seen and a lot of, again, top scientific facilities have known for 50 years that much of our soil is depleted of key trace elements and minerals.
[01:29:16.764 --> 01:29:22.745]  And the number one thing you can do for yourself is really a good liquid mineral supplement.
[01:29:22.745 --> 01:29:31.647]  And yes, a lot of the things that people develop is linked directly to the fact that a lot of the minerals have been sucked out of the food.
[01:29:31.647 --> 01:29:35.408]  I appreciate your call.
[01:29:35.408 --> 01:29:36.048]  Okay, folks.
[01:29:37.807 --> 01:29:49.775]  When we come back, after this quick break, I'm going to break down some very important information.
[01:29:49.775 --> 01:29:51.076]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.076 --> 01:29:54.998]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.998 --> 01:29:57.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:04.250 --> 01:31:07.111]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:31:07.111 --> 01:31:08.392]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:31:08.392 --> 01:31:09.213]  It's very real.
[01:31:09.213 --> 01:31:11.454]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.

[01:31:59.850 --> 01:32:04.415]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.415 --> 01:32:05.316]  Number one.
[01:32:05.316 --> 01:32:08.739]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.739 --> 01:32:09.600]  Number two.
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:14.505]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.505 --> 01:32:15.245]  It's true.
[01:32:15.245 --> 01:32:20.110]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.110 --> 01:32:20.571]  Number three.
[01:32:20.931 --> 01:32:24.514]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.514 --> 01:32:29.238]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:29.238 --> 01:32:32.000]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.464]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.464 --> 01:32:40.608]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.608 --> 01:32:45.372]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:45.652 --> 01:32:49.814]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:49.814 --> 01:32:51.614]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.614 --> 01:32:53.855]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:32:56.476 --> 01:33:11.982]  Way up north to Alaska Way up north to Alaska North to Alaska Go north for us, you're so
[01:33:13.568 --> 01:33:21.194]  Okay, we are now simulcasting live the last two and a half hours of the syndicated radio broadcast at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:33.223 --> 01:33:41.188]  Coming up in the next hour, I will continue with calls and I'm going to get to one of the most important subjects of the radio broadcast today.
[01:33:41.188 --> 01:33:45.991]  New York Times, Obama making plans to use executive orders.
[01:33:45.991 --> 01:33:50.334]  And our story is breaking this down at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:50.334 --> 01:33:55.617]  Obama declares he will rule by authoritarian decree, Curt Nemo, InfoWars.com today.
[01:33:56.678 --> 01:33:58.359]  Another story about Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:33:58.359 --> 01:34:01.341]  Obama breaks yet another campaign promise.
[01:34:01.341 --> 01:34:09.047]  And in this article Paul wrote, make sure you queue up for next hour, the video in there where he promised not to have these executive orders or signing statements.
[01:34:09.047 --> 01:34:09.707]  That's in the story.
[01:34:09.707 --> 01:34:12.709]  Obama breaks yet another campaign promise.
[01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:13.950]  There's also another story here.
[01:34:13.950 --> 01:34:18.033]  Obama eyes executive orders to circumvent Congress.
[01:34:18.033 --> 01:34:24.017]  We're going to be going over that today.
[01:34:24.017 --> 01:34:25.879]  I also have a
[01:34:27.734 --> 01:34:31.635]  Group of important articles here were Newsweek.
[01:34:31.635 --> 01:34:41.897]  When you see Newsweek and Time start targeting you multiple times a week, it signifies a larger order to go after a group of people.
[01:34:41.897 --> 01:34:44.437]  Obama information czar calls for banning free speech.
[01:34:44.437 --> 01:34:46.178]  You know about that.
[01:34:46.178 --> 01:34:47.798]  And that dovetails with Newsweek.
[01:34:47.798 --> 01:34:52.959]  Black helicopters over Nashville, which attacks myself and the Tea Party.
[01:34:52.959 --> 01:34:56.460]  And Watson's counter-article, go back to sleep, there's no new world order.
[01:34:57.793 --> 01:35:02.936]  And we have the newest article that came out the day after that.
[01:35:02.936 --> 01:35:05.717]  On Friday, Know Your Conspiracies.
[01:35:05.717 --> 01:35:12.100]  Newsweek's guide to today's trendiest, hippest, and least likely fringe beliefs.
[01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:14.281]  So they make it like it's a little trendy thing.
[01:35:14.281 --> 01:35:17.403]  No, this isn't trendy, what we do.
[01:35:17.403 --> 01:35:20.404]  This is life and death.
[01:35:20.404 --> 01:35:23.866]  This isn't a joke or a game.
[01:35:23.866 --> 01:35:27.228]  So that is coming up as well here.
[01:35:29.528 --> 01:35:37.830]  I want to break down Barack Obama and where he stands in the world.
[01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:57.875]  We're going to do that after this short four-minute video from Russia today with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the former head of policy at Treasury, the former editor of the Wall Street Journal, someone who's a real paleo-conservative or constitutionalist, just to set the tone of where we are as a society.
[01:36:04.195 --> 01:36:05.616]  So let's go ahead and play this clip.
[01:36:05.616 --> 01:36:15.141]  We'll be back in just a few minutes and I'll break down the fact that I believe they're getting ready to launch a false flag staged assassination attempt on Barack Obama.
[01:36:15.141 --> 01:36:15.541]  Stay with us.
[01:36:17.028 --> 01:36:18.549]  Well get ready for the crackdown.
[01:36:18.549 --> 01:36:19.070]  The U.S.
[01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:21.291]  is now officially known as a police state.
[01:36:21.291 --> 01:36:23.553]  At least that's according to Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:36:23.553 --> 01:36:29.317]  He's a columnist and a former Reagan administration official and he joins me live from Panama City, Florida.
[01:36:29.317 --> 01:36:31.419]  Paul, thanks so much for joining me.
[01:36:31.419 --> 01:36:32.440]  So you've said that U.S.
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:37.824]  President Obama is continuing Bush-era policies and that the United States is essentially a police state.
[01:36:37.824 --> 01:36:39.045]  Can you elaborate on that please?
[01:36:39.987 --> 01:36:41.328]  Well, yes.
[01:36:41.328 --> 01:36:58.682]  We have this case of Afia Siddiqui, who is an American citizen who was kidnapped and held in the Bagram military base in Afghanistan for five years, secretly tortured, denied all her constitutional rights.
[01:36:58.682 --> 01:37:02.545]  The whole thing was totally outside all known American law.
[01:37:04.526 --> 01:37:15.610]  And now we've had Dennis Blair, the head of National Intelligence, announce that the United States government has a list of Americans that it will assassinate abroad.
[01:37:15.610 --> 01:37:23.292]  So the government has announced it's going to kill its own citizens without arrest, without trial, without conviction of a capital crime.
[01:37:23.292 --> 01:37:25.453]  It's just going to shoot them down somewhere.
[01:37:25.453 --> 01:37:31.815]  Well, these two things together are the definition of a police state.
[01:37:32.715 --> 01:37:50.814]  And we have a number of constitutional scholars in our most distinguished law schools who have said that these proposals not only are totally illegal under American law, but constitute war crimes under the Geneva Conventions.
[01:37:50.814 --> 01:37:54.819]  And how else would you define a police state?
[01:37:55.447 --> 01:37:57.970]  And so, you know, I think that's really interesting, Mr. Roberts.
[01:37:57.970 --> 01:38:03.276]  I mean, especially because President Obama has spoken out against so many of these things, including torture.
[01:38:03.276 --> 01:38:07.240]  And, you know, he's repeatedly said that he wants to close down Guantanamo Bay.
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:11.585]  So why do you think nothing has changed and he's continuing these Bush-era policies then?
[01:38:12.589 --> 01:38:13.949]  That's a very good question.
[01:38:13.949 --> 01:38:19.431]  There's no difference so far between his administration and the Bush-Cheney regime.
[01:38:19.431 --> 01:38:26.673]  And so what we see is that there's been a coup, a power grab.
[01:38:26.673 --> 01:38:28.894]  The law means nothing to the government.
[01:38:28.894 --> 01:38:33.075]  It operates totally outside the law with contempt.
[01:38:33.875 --> 01:38:34.936]  of the law.
[01:38:34.936 --> 01:38:53.674]  And what's most amazing is that Dennis Blair, this is not my opinion, he went to the United States Congress and told one of the most important committees, the Committee on Intelligence, that the United States government now has a list of Americans that it will murder.
[01:38:53.674 --> 01:38:57.919]  Well, how does this differ from Joseph Stalin?
[01:38:58.641 --> 01:39:00.542]  And so, I mean, how is this all possible?
[01:39:00.542 --> 01:39:03.983]  How can the United States just simply disregard international law?
[01:39:03.983 --> 01:39:06.885]  And what should be done to stop this?
[01:39:06.885 --> 01:39:08.625]  I don't know how it's possible.
[01:39:08.625 --> 01:39:16.048]  I don't know how Joseph Stalin was able to murder all the heroes of the Bolshevik Revolution.
[01:39:16.048 --> 01:39:19.030]  I don't know how Hitler was able to take over Germany.
[01:39:20.362 --> 01:39:24.725]  And completely flush the law, but that's what's happening here.
[01:39:24.725 --> 01:39:45.416]  And we see, we have these statements from these distinguished American legal scholars that this is not only completely against the Geneva Conventions and the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which requires a due process,
[01:39:46.537 --> 01:39:50.802]  But if you announce you're just going to murder people, there's no due process.
[01:39:50.802 --> 01:39:53.045]  And so I don't know what's going on.
[01:39:53.045 --> 01:39:59.592]  I don't understand how this happens or why the American people are so insouciant and inattentive.
[01:39:59.592 --> 01:40:00.813]  They just sit and take it.
[01:40:00.813 --> 01:40:05.679]  I don't understand why the Congress, when they were told this, didn't order this guy's arrest.
[01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:14.085]  I mean, we have a criminal, the head of national intelligence, who comes to the Congress and says, we're going to murder American citizens.
[01:40:14.085 --> 01:40:15.326]  Nothing happens.
[01:40:15.326 --> 01:40:17.967]  Well, Mr. Roberts, I want to thank you so much.
[01:40:17.967 --> 01:40:19.789]  You're clearly very passionate about this.
[01:40:19.789 --> 01:40:30.236]  According to Mr. Roberts, the United States turning into a police state.
[01:40:30.236 --> 01:40:30.756]  Glenn Beck.
[01:40:34.346 --> 01:40:48.172]  I have taken a particular interest in this man because when he showed up on the scene in 2002 on talk radio, he was clearly an actor.
[01:40:48.172 --> 01:41:02.899]  And then I saw him over the years always pose as a constitutionalist, as a patriot, but at every key juncture point when Ron Paul had a chance to win the Republican primary, Glenn Beck came out and said he's dangerous, he's bad, use the army against him and his supporters.
[01:41:03.962 --> 01:41:11.209]  Even last year, over and over again, calling Ron Paul a kook.
[01:41:11.209 --> 01:41:12.911]  And I've seen him do countless other things.
[01:41:12.911 --> 01:41:18.417]  You know, he'll do some good on the healthcare, he'll do some good on ACORN, he'll do some good on some
[01:41:19.741 --> 01:41:21.502]  We're good to go.
[01:41:47.028 --> 01:41:49.430]  We have Republicans being booed at the Tea Parties.
[01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:57.256]  Rick Perry, Cornyn, others a year and two months ago here in Texas.
[01:41:57.256 --> 01:41:59.477]  Then the Republicans come in and start taking it over.
[01:41:59.477 --> 01:42:03.160]  Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin and others.
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:07.083]  You have Palin coming into Texas, endorsing Perry over Debra Medina.
[01:42:07.083 --> 01:42:10.445]  She would definitely win if Palin would have endorsed her.
[01:42:10.445 --> 01:42:16.110]  So to control us, they have to pose as us, just as Cass Sunstein at the White House says.
[01:42:18.237 --> 01:42:22.820]  Because the establishment has no credibility in the controlled right or the controlled left.
[01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:29.524]  So they have to pose as the revolutionaries to be able to maintain control of the population.
[01:42:29.524 --> 01:42:47.255]  Now, on key issues of 9-11 Truth, of FEMA camps that they have bills in Congress for, that they admit they've built, the civilian inmate labor camp program, Army.mil, you've got all of this
[01:42:48.439 --> 01:42:53.847]  Admit it on record.
[01:42:53.847 --> 01:42:54.689]  And then you have...
[01:42:56.556 --> 01:43:05.043]  Glenn Beck, on subject after subject, building up the hype for a month, and I believe the FEMA camp's surreal, he said, and then coming out and discrediting it.
[01:43:05.043 --> 01:43:16.033]  Exactly as I predicted he would, even with the very fake camps that we exposed over a decade ago, I predicted he would use those fake camps, and he did indeed do that.
[01:43:16.033 --> 01:43:24.080]  A, he's either completely copying everything on this show, or B, I knew he would go with what had already been
[01:43:25.799 --> 01:43:33.144]  Debunked, and I understood his mindset to such a level, we were able to accurately predict that.
[01:43:33.144 --> 01:43:35.706]  But bottom line, he's a teleprompter reading puppet.
[01:43:35.706 --> 01:43:41.770]  Now again, when Bush is in, the Republicans are the face of the New World Order and the establishment.
[01:43:41.770 --> 01:43:52.597]  And they push for the open borders, and the high taxes, and tripling the size of government, and new wars, and torture, and homeland security, and NORTHCOM, and in April of
[01:43:55.632 --> 01:44:05.440]  2008, the Bush White House has the Justice Department under Mukasey put out the MIAC Homeland Security Report.
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:21.754]  They put out the master report stating the number one enemy of the government and of NORTHCOM and Homeland Security is gun owners, conservatives, returning veterans that are gun owners, libertarians, in the fetters, Ron Paul, Bob Barr.
[01:44:21.754 --> 01:44:23.135]  Then we get the information
[01:44:24.239 --> 01:44:29.308]  In January, we release it, and the media, Fox News, picks it up.
[01:44:30.442 --> 01:44:33.284]  And says, oh look, Obama issued this.
[01:44:33.284 --> 01:44:36.786]  And Obama did reissue it and did expand it.
[01:44:36.786 --> 01:44:55.159]  But the point is, I knew back in 2007, 2008, that Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Neil Bortz, all of these guys had gone to the White House, met with Bush over and over again, came out and told us he was a man of God we should trust, a man we should love.
[01:44:55.159 --> 01:44:59.942]  And I knew, because I'd had previous Homeland Security reports distributed at the state levels,
[01:45:01.984 --> 01:45:06.949]  We've gotten and released more than 30 over the years, a lot more than that.
[01:45:06.949 --> 01:45:10.613]  Look at my films like Road to Tyranny and Police Day 2000.
[01:45:10.613 --> 01:45:14.477]  Films made 8 years ago, a film made 10 years ago.
[01:45:14.477 --> 01:45:21.324]  In the case of Police Day 2000, you see everything that's in the MIAC report and in the Homeland Security report that got so much attention finally last year.
[01:45:22.403 --> 01:45:27.327]  But being issued by Bill Clinton, by George Bush, by Barack Obama, it doesn't matter.
[01:45:27.327 --> 01:45:28.368]  It's the same.
[01:45:28.368 --> 01:45:37.035]  And so when I saw Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity, Limbaugh never really did it.
[01:45:37.035 --> 01:45:39.577]  He's kind of his own person, but still establishment.
[01:45:39.577 --> 01:45:42.640]  But I mean, these guys are actually getting talking points from the White House.
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:48.525]  When I heard them giving out exact talking points, I said these guys are obviously enemies.
[01:45:50.455 --> 01:46:03.644]  These guys are posing as conservatives so they can control the true constitutionalist movement that's the real threat to the global takeover.
[01:46:03.644 --> 01:46:11.190]  And so that's how I knew back in 2006-2007 Beck was bad because he's always been the worst.
[01:46:11.190 --> 01:46:17.414]  Sean Hannity a close second saying arrest all militias, make them illegal, every child needs a microchip, you know, stuff like that.
[01:46:17.414 --> 01:46:19.475]  And I'm not even paying much attention to these guys.
[01:46:19.475 --> 01:46:20.096]  I'm too busy.
[01:46:21.451 --> 01:46:26.675]  And it just gets worse and worse and worse by the minute.
[01:46:26.675 --> 01:46:37.905]  And so you look at all the countless examples of sabotage against real patriots, against real libertarians, against real conservatives, against people that are truly anti-New World Order.
[01:46:37.905 --> 01:46:41.167]  It's as clear as the nose on my face or your face.
[01:46:41.167 --> 01:46:44.670]  I mean, you can see my nose right now if you're watching presentplanet.tv.
[01:46:44.670 --> 01:46:46.011]  It's there.
[01:46:46.011 --> 01:46:46.492]  It's clear.
[01:46:48.234 --> 01:46:50.975]  It's like watching a duck swimming around in a pond and saying, is that a duck?
[01:46:50.975 --> 01:46:53.817]  Gee, I don't know.
[01:46:53.817 --> 01:47:00.181]  And he's shown himself again with his Debra Medina thing, where she just said, that's not a state issue, I don't really get into that, people have a right to their opinion.
[01:47:00.181 --> 01:47:02.082]  Oh my God, you're a 9-11 truther!
[01:47:02.082 --> 01:47:06.044]  And within 35 minutes, the robo calls from Rick Perry.
[01:47:07.270 --> 01:47:11.573]  And Kay Bailey Hutchinson and the big neocon blogs were saying it's over from her.
[01:47:11.573 --> 01:47:25.643]  Because they know if the fake left attacks Debra Medina, a True States writer, a true nullification person over federal control, Tenth Amendment, now called Tenthers by Newsweek, they know a left attack would only embolden her.
[01:47:25.643 --> 01:47:32.268]  They gotta have a phony right-wing attack, which is what Cass Sunstein talks about in the White House memos and in all these white papers he's written.
[01:47:33.601 --> 01:47:40.387]  The regulations are, he says, we've got to pose as these anti-establishment people to get them in fighting with each other.
[01:47:40.387 --> 01:47:43.950]  That's the only way we get credibility.
[01:47:43.950 --> 01:47:46.072]  And again, it's very complex, very sophisticated.
[01:47:46.072 --> 01:47:50.176]  I'm just giving you the basics here.
[01:47:50.176 --> 01:47:55.800]  And I noticed in the last three months, all these editorials, there were five of them in the last week and a half.
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:58.042]  A big one in National Review by Pipes.
[01:47:59.159 --> 01:48:05.124]  Saying Obama, launch a war against Iran or your candidacy is dead.
[01:48:05.124 --> 01:48:07.947]  Israel tells him that.
[01:48:07.947 --> 01:48:12.731]  His Chief of Staff, who's admittedly an Israeli Army member.
[01:48:12.731 --> 01:48:14.672]  Rahm Emanuel tells him that.
[01:48:14.672 --> 01:48:18.316]  Now again, Obama's a puppet, but he doesn't want to commit political suicide.
[01:48:18.316 --> 01:48:21.438]  But they're saying, you do this or we're going to destroy you.
[01:48:21.438 --> 01:48:23.460]  We're going to allow an impeachment.
[01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:24.561]  We're going to remove you.
[01:48:24.561 --> 01:48:25.602]  But if you play ball,
[01:48:26.954 --> 01:48:29.957]  And Sarah Palin openly said this on Fox News a week and a half ago.
[01:48:29.957 --> 01:48:31.598]  You know, we played the clip here.
[01:48:31.598 --> 01:48:43.189]  She said, if you play ball and play the war card and do what, you know, declare war as I think you should, you can pull the clip up, we played it here, then you're going to win in 2012.
[01:48:43.189 --> 01:48:44.670]  And I'm basically not going to run against you.
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:49:02.628]  And then I heard Glenn Beck start beating the drum three weeks ago that 9-11 truthers are revolutionaries and they're figuring out that Obama's going to continue the torture and the wars and the secret arrest and so they're going to kill Obama.
[01:49:02.628 --> 01:49:03.989]  And I don't really even watch his show.
[01:49:03.989 --> 01:49:05.110]  I can't stand it.
[01:49:05.110 --> 01:49:14.555]  But this morning I watched a clip that's up on PrisonPlanet.com and a story titled
[01:49:16.303 --> 01:49:17.424]  A message to Glenn Beck.
[01:49:17.424 --> 01:49:19.366]  What are the dangers of the 9-11 truthers?
[01:49:19.366 --> 01:49:25.190]  Excellent article by Joe Robertson.
[01:49:25.190 --> 01:49:35.019]  And it was a repeat of what Glenn Beck said that I heard on the radio, but even worse.
[01:49:35.019 --> 01:49:42.265]  And he said, I fear for Obama because the left, the 9-11 truthers, which aren't the left, it's just the American people.
[01:49:43.257 --> 01:49:45.038]  So, again, he makes it a left-right paradigm.
[01:49:45.038 --> 01:49:48.300]  And he has this left-right paradigm up on the screen, on the left and the right.
[01:49:48.300 --> 01:50:05.488]  He says he's against the left-right paradigm, but every graphic he shows, every chalkboard illustration at a third-grade level for his audience, he shows it and he says, oh, everybody's on the left over here that thinks 9-11 was an inside job, when it's not a left-right issue.
[01:50:05.488 --> 01:50:08.390]  They're scared of populists finding out about this.
[01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:10.611]  They're scared of it not being seen as conservative.
[01:50:13.553 --> 01:50:14.874]  If you're pro-war.
[01:50:14.874 --> 01:50:16.115]  They're losing control.
[01:50:16.115 --> 01:50:23.160]  9-11 truth is even bigger than it ever was.
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:30.365]  I mean, this morning on 590 AM, caller after caller calling in about Building 7, they weren't even discussing it.
[01:50:30.365 --> 01:50:40.031]  There's been a total loss of credibility by government across the board, whether it's Obama, or George Bush, or Sarah Palin, or Rick Perry.
[01:50:40.031 --> 01:50:42.353]  And so from all the clear evidence I've seen,
[01:50:45.191 --> 01:50:46.952]  And Tarpley said this a few months ago.
[01:50:46.952 --> 01:50:53.275]  I now agree with him, but I've got more to add.
[01:50:53.275 --> 01:51:00.358]  When we come back after the break, I'm going to really lay out what their current operation is and what their future plans are.
[01:51:00.358 --> 01:51:03.400]  Hey everybody, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:06.121]  If you're looking for the perfect Christmas gift, listen up.
[01:51:06.121 --> 01:51:08.362]  This will make your holiday shopping very easy.
[01:51:09.053 --> 01:51:15.055]  This year, give a seed bank from one of our oldest sponsors, Solutions from Science, to your friends and family.
[01:51:15.055 --> 01:51:15.795]  Here's why.
[01:51:15.795 --> 01:51:23.997]  The Survival Seed Bank will give any friend or loved one the ability to grow a full acre crisis garden of nutritionally dense, life-sustaining food.
[01:51:23.997 --> 01:51:28.038]  And the Survival Seed Bank is not just a box of open-pollinated seeds.
[01:51:28.038 --> 01:51:33.920]  It's an indestructible, waterproof seed bank that can even be buried if we face a real meltdown.
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:34.780]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:42.988]  All the seeds in the Survival Seed Bank go through strict germination testing so you can be confident you're not buying old seeds.
[01:51:42.988 --> 01:51:47.293]  Give a Survival Seed Bank this Christmas by going to survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:47.293 --> 01:51:49.375]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:49.375 --> 01:51:53.459]  Or you can call 877-327-0365 to give the gift that produces an ongoing supply of life-sustaining food.
[01:52:01.052 --> 01:52:01.732]  Hello.
[01:52:01.732 --> 01:52:06.474]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[01:52:06.474 --> 01:52:11.296]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[01:52:11.296 --> 01:52:16.298]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[01:52:16.298 --> 01:52:21.140]  I have about 15 wild food guides on my bookshelf, which left me wondering if I even needed another book.
[01:52:21.460 --> 01:52:22.721]  Boy, was I wrong.
[01:52:22.721 --> 01:52:25.883]  My knowledge exploded to an entire universe of wild foods.
[01:52:25.883 --> 01:52:29.725]  In olden days, it was the norm to know which plants are edible and which are not.
[01:52:29.725 --> 01:52:32.947]  Dear Linda, just wanted to let you know I received your book today.
[01:52:32.947 --> 01:52:33.487]  Wow!
[01:52:33.487 --> 01:52:35.008]  I watched the DVD last night.
[01:52:35.008 --> 01:52:36.249]  I was awestruck.
[01:52:36.249 --> 01:52:37.930]  What wonderful work you have done.
[01:52:37.930 --> 01:52:40.452]  This information can bless many people.
[01:52:40.452 --> 01:52:40.972]  Thank you.
[01:52:41.653 --> 01:52:42.414]  Thanks again.
[01:52:42.414 --> 01:52:45.537]  Your book has given me the most hope and inspiration.
[01:52:45.537 --> 01:52:46.138]  Thank you.
[01:52:46.138 --> 01:52:49.562]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.

[01:53:02.415 --> 01:53:04.056]  Is it safe to breathe anymore?
[01:53:04.056 --> 01:53:15.502]  Crowded public places, global pandemics, and news reports of potential new strains of bacteria and viruses make you wonder, what if there was a germ-killing nasal spray that acted almost like hand sanitizer for your nose?
[01:53:15.502 --> 01:53:16.462]  There is!
[01:53:16.462 --> 01:53:20.204]  It's called Sinofresh Homeopathic Nasal Spray, and it's a proven germ killer.
[01:53:20.544 --> 01:53:29.133]  Sinofresh is a revolutionary doctor-recommended nasal spray that kills a broad spectrum of viruses, bacteria, molds, and fungi on contact in your nose.

[01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:39.763]  Sinofresh must be a part of your family survival plan.

[01:53:58.579 --> 01:53:59.140]  It works.
[01:54:04.417 --> 01:54:13.664]  See, what's happened is, the quote, conspiracy culture is taking over.
[01:54:13.664 --> 01:54:20.429]  Newsweek, Time Magazine are pulling their hair out, saying, oh my God, nobody believes anything we say anymore.
[01:54:20.429 --> 01:54:22.311]  Everybody's a conspiracy theorist now.
[01:54:22.311 --> 01:54:25.953]  I've got two Newsweek articles in the last week on this alone.
[01:54:25.953 --> 01:54:26.594]  It's everywhere.
[01:54:27.881 --> 01:54:32.064]  Talk radio listeners don't want to talk about phony right-wing stuff, phony left-wing stuff.
[01:54:32.064 --> 01:54:34.165]  They want to talk about the offshore banks.
[01:54:34.165 --> 01:54:36.567]  They want to talk about the New World Order.
[01:54:36.567 --> 01:54:39.929]  They want to talk about the private Federal Reserve.
[01:54:39.929 --> 01:54:51.557]  And so they're sending in their agents like Glenn Beck to pose as one of us so at key points he can sabotage our movement with Ron Paul or Deborah Medina or we're exposing FEMA camps.
[01:54:54.127 --> 01:54:55.048]  Look at Jesse Ventura.
[01:54:55.048 --> 01:54:56.608]  His TV show goes on TruTV.
[01:54:56.608 --> 01:54:57.369]  I consult on it.
[01:54:57.369 --> 01:54:58.730]  I appear in it.
[01:54:58.730 --> 01:55:01.391]  Becomes number one overnight.
[01:55:01.391 --> 01:55:03.332]  The question is, will they give him another season?
[01:55:03.332 --> 01:55:05.193]  We're not sure yet.
[01:55:05.193 --> 01:55:06.994]  Get his book.
[01:55:06.994 --> 01:55:08.615]  Jesse Ventura.
[01:55:08.615 --> 01:55:11.817]  American Conspiracy.
[01:55:11.817 --> 01:55:12.377]  It's excellent.
[01:55:14.014 --> 01:55:14.854]  It's $24.95.
[01:55:14.854 --> 01:55:25.397]  You can get it for $19.95 at InfoWars.com and get a free Loose Change Final Cut, a preeminent 9-11 film, or the Reflections and Warnings documentary I made about Aaron Russo.
[01:55:25.397 --> 01:55:26.137]  Free!
[01:55:26.137 --> 01:55:30.118]  A free $20 film and $5 off the book.
[01:55:30.118 --> 01:55:31.679]  $19.95, a book and a film.
[01:55:31.679 --> 01:55:33.219]  InfoWars.com.
[01:55:33.219 --> 01:55:34.859]  Your purchase supports this show.
[01:55:34.859 --> 01:55:39.281]  You get a DVD, you can show to your friends and family, a book you can read, then give to family.
[01:55:39.281 --> 01:55:40.641]  Covers a whole host of issues.
[01:55:43.530 --> 01:55:45.755]  This is an incredible book.
[01:55:45.755 --> 01:55:46.637]  We have them right now.
[01:55:46.637 --> 01:55:49.223]  We can't ship them yet, but early next month, you will be the first to get it.
[01:55:49.223 --> 01:55:50.386]  We will ship it out to you.
[01:55:50.386 --> 01:55:52.791]  Jesse Ventura, American Conspiracies.
[01:55:55.464 --> 01:55:58.885]  Also, How Weed Won the West, now available.
[01:55:58.885 --> 01:56:11.689]  It's a 10th Amendment film, a film about government drug dealing, a film about how they control the drugs, how they launder the money, how they put you in their private prisons, and how if we take their drug war away from them, that's a major support system.
[01:56:11.689 --> 01:56:16.490]  Their fake wars, their fake terror, their fake biological threats, all of it.
[01:56:16.490 --> 01:56:18.851]  How Weed Won the West, now shipping.
[01:56:19.671 --> 01:56:21.552]  So order it today at InfoWars.com.
[01:56:21.552 --> 01:56:24.554]  We have it discounted out of the gates and a bunch of other specials.

[01:56:29.998 --> 01:56:39.323]  Okay, so I've begun to get into Glenn Beck.
[01:56:39.323 --> 01:56:41.805]  I have started breaking down a lot of the things he's done.
[01:56:46.124 --> 01:57:14.204]  But studying false flag terror, studying how the globalists operate, studying things that they have done in the past, studying how they have operated in the past, you get a very clear picture of their psychological makeup.
[01:57:15.037 --> 01:57:17.159]  of their modus operandi.
[01:57:17.159 --> 01:57:18.840]  If they're one thing, they're pathological.
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:24.204]  They do the same thing in different variants over and over again.
[01:57:24.204 --> 01:57:30.990]  They're going to have trouble staging another domestic terror attack or another staged bio-attack like the flu.
[01:57:30.990 --> 01:57:37.095]  They're going to have trouble launching a new war after they got caught lying about Iraq with the supposed WMDs.
[01:57:37.095 --> 01:57:40.738]  They've been caught lying about Iran with supposed WMDs.
[01:57:43.772 --> 01:57:50.795]  And so how are they going to launch their criminal agenda?
[01:57:50.795 --> 01:57:59.179]  What are some of the things from studying these people that we know they're going to do?
[01:57:59.179 --> 01:58:07.783]  Many people from the day Barack Obama was elected, well really even before, marveled at the fact that we had our supposed first black president.
[01:58:08.851 --> 01:58:11.154]  He's actually less than 10% African.
[01:58:11.154 --> 01:58:16.960]  He's mainly Anglo and Arab, but we have our first Arab president, whatever.
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:30.375]  And so when we come back, I'm going to systematically break this down and talk about what clearly is the next false flag move for the globalists, for the New World Order.
[01:58:32.130 --> 01:58:39.899]  So that's coming up after the 72nd break as we reach the halfway point in transmission.
[01:58:39.899 --> 01:58:45.765]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.765 --> 01:58:47.667]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.328 --> 01:58:54.330]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:54.330 --> 01:58:59.673]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:59.673 --> 01:59:01.714]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:59:01.714 --> 01:59:06.717]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:59:06.717 --> 01:59:07.638]  How much do you want?
[01:59:07.898 --> 01:59:09.019]  When do you want it?
[01:59:09.019 --> 01:59:10.901]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:59:10.901 --> 01:59:11.981]  When will you need it?
[01:59:11.981 --> 01:59:14.183]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:59:14.183 --> 01:59:15.524]  Will there be any food?
[01:59:15.524 --> 01:59:17.046]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:59:17.046 --> 01:59:22.310]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:25.893]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:59:25.893 --> 01:59:29.376]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:59:29.716 --> 01:59:30.937]  How much will you need?
[01:59:30.937 --> 01:59:31.838]  We don't know.
[01:59:31.838 --> 01:59:32.939]  How much do you want?
[01:59:32.939 --> 01:59:33.879]  All you can get.
[01:59:33.879 --> 01:59:34.980]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:34.980 --> 01:59:38.023]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:59:38.023 --> 01:59:38.543]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:38.543 --> 01:59:40.265]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:40.265 --> 01:59:41.245]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:41.245 --> 01:59:42.426]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:42.426 --> 01:59:44.268]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.569 --> 02:00:10.391]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.391 --> 02:00:11.991]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.991 --> 02:00:13.532]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.532 --> 02:00:17.733]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.733 --> 02:00:24.996]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.996 --> 02:00:26.416]  Open phones coming up.
[02:00:26.416 --> 02:00:32.358]  I'm going to get into all the Newsweek hit pieces on myself and others and break those down.
[02:00:32.358 --> 02:00:34.659]  Glenn Beck's treacherous attack on Deborah Medina.
[02:00:36.215 --> 02:00:37.536]  And a lot more.
[02:00:37.536 --> 02:00:42.139]  On the financial front, with open talk of the Euro completely collapsing.
[02:00:42.139 --> 02:00:44.841]  Which we, of course, predicted years ago.
[02:00:44.841 --> 02:00:47.443]  That is coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:47.443 --> 02:00:50.566]  Alright, on the subject of Glenn Beck.
[02:00:50.566 --> 02:00:54.769]  He's only a player in this larger theatrical shenanigan.
[02:00:57.566 --> 02:01:04.893]  I have seen Sarah Palin, I have seen Pipes, I've seen all these top neocons in editorials and on television in the last few months.
[02:01:04.893 --> 02:01:07.836]  You've all seen it as well, we played the clips here.
[02:01:07.836 --> 02:01:17.266]  Say, attack Iran or your presidency is over.
[02:01:17.266 --> 02:01:20.249]  And we know that again, Obama is a puppet.
[02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:25.485]  But he doesn't want to politically destroy himself as well.
[02:01:38.103 --> 02:01:40.304]  The truth or thing that's been promoted.
[02:01:40.304 --> 02:01:44.686]  They've got all these ways, whether true or not, they can bring down Obama whenever they want.
[02:01:44.686 --> 02:01:46.968]  He's outlived his usefulness.
[02:01:46.968 --> 02:01:50.409]  He's one year and a month into his administration.
[02:01:50.409 --> 02:01:58.593]  And he is politically crashing and burning with the lowest approval rating of any president 13 months into their administration.
[02:01:58.593 --> 02:02:02.996]  And the line on the graph goes straight down.
[02:02:02.996 --> 02:02:07.178]  From the heights of 80 plus percent down to 40 percent and dropping fast.
[02:02:08.959 --> 02:02:13.982]  How do the globalists grab victory out of the jaws of defeat?
[02:02:13.982 --> 02:02:16.244]  Well, we know they're M.O.
[02:02:16.244 --> 02:02:17.845]  And I have to give credit where credit is due.
[02:02:17.845 --> 02:02:27.511]  Of all these hundreds of different points I have that bring me to this conclusion, tarpally a few months ago, when the gatecrashers, who've now taken the Fifth Amendment,
[02:02:28.399 --> 02:02:34.141]  In congressional testimony, everything is about security, security, how Obama's not safe.
[02:02:34.141 --> 02:02:39.384]  When he was running for president in Dallas, there was no security there.
[02:02:39.384 --> 02:02:42.325]  Oh my God, there are people down the street wearing firearms.
[02:02:42.325 --> 02:02:44.386]  Oh, we've got to restrict the Second Amendment.
[02:02:44.386 --> 02:02:45.566]  What are we going to do?
[02:02:45.566 --> 02:02:50.208]  Somebody's going to go after Obama.
[02:02:50.208 --> 02:02:56.191]  And now I see video of Glenn Beck and other neocons in the last month over and over again saying,
[02:02:57.533 --> 02:03:04.097]  9-11 truthers and anti-war-ers are going to assassinate Obama in the White House.
[02:03:04.097 --> 02:03:05.117]  Well, wait a minute.
[02:03:05.117 --> 02:03:12.121]  If Obama's so pro-war and so pro-police state and Northcom, why are you guys attacking him?
[02:03:12.121 --> 02:03:13.621]  Well, you're there to support him.
[02:03:13.621 --> 02:03:19.985]  When Glenn Beck comes out, who's discredited with the controlled left, and attacks Obama, that then gives him support.
[02:03:19.985 --> 02:03:24.407]  Remember a year ago, we got internal White House memos where they said, we're going to run against Rush Limbaugh.
[02:03:25.373 --> 02:03:30.096]  He's discredited, he's a drug addict, he's got all these problems.
[02:03:30.096 --> 02:03:46.186]  We will play up the fact that everything is Rush Limbaugh and try to get the left to now support war, support torture, support big government, support banker bailouts, because the alternative is Rush Limbaugh and the Republicans.
[02:03:46.186 --> 02:03:52.430]  Well, more and more now, because they're not sure if he's going to stay employed or stay sober or he's got heart problems, whatever the case may be,
[02:03:53.775 --> 02:03:59.842]  That the replacement for Limbaugh and the 2.0 of propaganda, of fake conservatism, is now Glenn Beck.
[02:03:59.842 --> 02:04:02.866]  Far worse.
[02:04:02.866 --> 02:04:06.750]  They tried Savage, but he isn't globalist enough for them.
[02:04:06.750 --> 02:04:09.373]  With the MSNBC show, as you know, five years ago.
[02:04:09.373 --> 02:04:09.894]  Four years ago.
[02:04:14.426 --> 02:04:17.128]  And so, they're stuck between a rock and a hard place.
[02:04:17.128 --> 02:04:23.874]  How do they stage new terror attacks when the average person now understands inside job, self-inflicted wound, false flag?
[02:04:23.874 --> 02:04:25.796]  When that's now in the vernacular.
[02:04:25.796 --> 02:04:27.337]  People now understand that.
[02:04:27.337 --> 02:04:29.339]  People are now on the lookout for that.
[02:04:29.339 --> 02:04:32.481]  Look at Kurt Haskell and his wife on the plane.
[02:04:32.481 --> 02:04:39.407]  Seeing the second bomber, seeing the sharp-dressed man get him on the plane, seeing the government clearly got him on the plane, protected him, that's now admitted.
[02:04:40.268 --> 02:04:42.669]  By the State Department and the FBI.
[02:04:42.669 --> 02:04:44.510]  They let him on the plane without a passport.
[02:04:44.510 --> 02:04:45.450]  They protected him.
[02:04:45.450 --> 02:04:46.670]  They got him on the plane.
[02:04:46.670 --> 02:04:49.791]  See, because we have people watching now everywhere.
[02:04:49.791 --> 02:04:59.615]  So I'm going to continue breaking down the evidence when we come back with the fact that I believe they're going to pull a false flag assassination attempt straight ahead.
[02:04:59.615 --> 02:05:00.015]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.782 --> 02:05:07.747]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:05:07.747 --> 02:05:09.028]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:05:09.028 --> 02:05:09.849]  It's very real.
[02:05:09.849 --> 02:05:12.090]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:05:12.090 --> 02:05:13.752]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:05:13.752 --> 02:05:18.215]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[02:06:00.578 --> 02:06:05.121]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:05.121 --> 02:06:06.021]  Number one.
[02:06:06.021 --> 02:06:09.463]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.463 --> 02:06:10.324]  Number two.
[02:06:10.324 --> 02:06:15.206]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.206 --> 02:06:15.947]  It's true.
[02:06:15.947 --> 02:06:20.810]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:20.810 --> 02:06:21.350]  Number three.
[02:06:21.630 --> 02:06:25.233]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.233 --> 02:06:29.937]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.937 --> 02:06:32.699]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:32.699 --> 02:06:37.183]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:37.183 --> 02:06:41.307]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.307 --> 02:06:46.091]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:46.371 --> 02:06:50.534]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:50.534 --> 02:06:52.316]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:52.316 --> 02:06:54.578]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:06:54.578 --> 02:06:56.919]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:02.301 --> 02:07:06.262]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:06.262 --> 02:07:15.124]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:07:15.124 --> 02:07:19.745]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:07:19.745 --> 02:07:30.567]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:07:31.187 --> 02:07:40.709]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:40.709 --> 02:07:46.131]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:07:46.131 --> 02:07:53.632]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:53.632 --> 02:07:56.373]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:08:01.212 --> 02:08:06.455]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.455 --> 02:08:14.919]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:14.919 --> 02:08:24.924]  Okay, about a month and a half ago when we first had the White House gate crashers at that party, I've really learned to respect Webster Tarpley's deep analysis
[02:08:26.109 --> 02:08:36.152]  He said that off of that story and a bunch of others, the way they were written, that they were preparing the public for the idea that Obama isn't safe inside the White House.
[02:08:36.152 --> 02:08:42.714]  Not from people that sneak into parties and the two or three security breaches they've had, which they've done the statistics on, that's normal.
[02:08:42.714 --> 02:08:46.175]  It's about on par for how many they normally have.
[02:08:46.175 --> 02:08:50.636]  But this was being obsessed on to introduce the idea of an inside coup.
[02:08:52.062 --> 02:08:52.262]  I think?
[02:09:10.401 --> 02:09:33.988]  Well, over the last year, seeing all these staged events where they get meth heads or ex-cons and set them up and claim that they were going to attack Obama and they find some drug head white supremacist who said they were going to wear white tuxedos with white top hats and play ZZ Top and go kill him and just all, you know, they found a lot of nuts to kind of introduce that idea as well.
[02:09:33.988 --> 02:09:38.270]  And that dovetails in with the MIAC report, the Homeland Security reports and others.
[02:09:38.270 --> 02:09:39.430]  So I saw that going on.
[02:09:40.936 --> 02:09:57.834]  And then just knowing how they operate and what they do and a lot of other ingredients to their modus operandi, I then started seeing the globalists say, look, your presidency is over and you're going to get impeached or not even get reelected if you don't launch a new war.
[02:09:57.834 --> 02:09:59.296]  That's the only way to save yourself.
[02:10:00.759 --> 02:10:05.584]  And we had previous neocon articles about how great 9-11 was and how we need another 9-11.
[02:10:05.584 --> 02:10:06.946]  And that's what Glenn Beck's all about.
[02:10:06.946 --> 02:10:08.387]  The 9-12 project.
[02:10:08.387 --> 02:10:10.430]  The day after 9-11.
[02:10:10.430 --> 02:10:17.618]  That feeling we had of wanting to nuke people, of wanting to torture, of how we came together under a big lie of fraud.
[02:10:17.618 --> 02:10:20.060]  That's what he wants to re-invoke.
[02:10:20.060 --> 02:10:21.222]  So everything is about that.
[02:10:22.489 --> 02:10:29.575]  And they hate the 9-11 Truth Movement because they track and read and have the aggregate systems online with Google and the NSA.
[02:10:29.575 --> 02:10:32.538]  They know that 9-11 Truth is actually growing.
[02:10:32.538 --> 02:10:33.739]  I hear it on talk radio.
[02:10:33.739 --> 02:10:34.620]  I see it on the web.
[02:10:34.620 --> 02:10:37.522]  More and more evidence comes out.
[02:10:37.522 --> 02:10:39.143]  It just grows and grows.
[02:10:39.143 --> 02:10:41.746]  It's been depoliticized now that Bush left.
[02:10:41.746 --> 02:10:45.389]  A lot of conservatives are now looking at it and learning about false flag.
[02:10:45.389 --> 02:10:49.873]  What's one of the only false flags they've got that can make Obama a victim
[02:10:51.454 --> 02:11:00.223]  Try to, and I've seen this going on for a decade, merge the idea of militias and constitutionalists working with Muslim extremists.
[02:11:00.223 --> 02:11:01.785]  What's the only way to do that?
[02:11:01.785 --> 02:11:09.513]  And then somehow tie that into the radical left and be able to sic homeland security and NORTHCOM on the American people.
[02:11:09.513 --> 02:11:12.857]  What is the only way they're going to be able to do that?
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:22.607]  By staging a fake assassination attempt on Obama where he survives or where he is wounded.
[02:11:22.607 --> 02:11:23.087]  What was it?
[02:11:23.087 --> 02:11:36.380]  Ten years ago it even came out in the mainstream news that the Taiwanese president staged a shooting of himself in a parade and it turned out they just set off some firecrackers and then they put a little cut on his side during an election.
[02:11:36.380 --> 02:11:37.481]  I mean, this is what they do.
[02:11:39.161 --> 02:11:44.706]  Different Roman emperors would stage assassination attempts on themselves as a pretext to crack down on people.
[02:11:44.706 --> 02:11:46.968]  The czars would do this.
[02:11:46.968 --> 02:11:57.778]  Saddam Hussein did this under US direction in 1979 when he got power.
[02:11:57.778 --> 02:12:00.120]  That's how he arrested his political opposition.
[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:04.844]  So we know that's in the playbook of the CIA and other governments.
[02:12:04.844 --> 02:12:05.325]  And then
[02:12:07.327 --> 02:12:16.974]  I went ahead last night and this morning and searched the term on YouTube of assassinations planned on Obama.
[02:12:16.974 --> 02:12:19.556]  And I found Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity and others.
[02:12:19.556 --> 02:12:31.024]  That's clearly a talking point that they've now got saying his White House is infiltrated with 9-11 truthers and they're going to try to kill him.
[02:12:32.375 --> 02:12:37.820]  And the anti-war movement, they're going to try to kill him because he's expanding the wars.
[02:12:37.820 --> 02:12:41.843]  While they give him left cover, criticizing him for not starting enough wars.
[02:12:41.843 --> 02:12:45.206]  So it's a balancing act to re-energize the left-right paradigm.
[02:12:46.792 --> 02:12:51.014]  At the same time claiming they're not part of the left-right paradigm, that they're anti-establishment.
[02:12:51.014 --> 02:12:54.637]  As if Roger Ailes and Fox News is anti-establishment.
[02:12:54.637 --> 02:12:59.720]  And they're dovetailing their propaganda in Newsweek and Time Magazine with Beck.
[02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:03.282]  Beck says, I'm a patriot, but then criticizes all the real patriot groups.
[02:13:04.409 --> 02:13:14.471]  And then Newsweek and Time attack Beck and mix him in with Alex Jones and Ron Paul because they're discrediting Beck from the left angle so the left doesn't like me.
[02:13:14.471 --> 02:13:18.352]  And then Beck attacks myself and others so that the right wing doesn't like us.
[02:13:18.352 --> 02:13:26.854]  Because we're the real bonafide patriots here who understand the tools of statecraft and manipulation that are being used against us.
[02:13:28.615 --> 02:13:30.097]  I'm going to play this Glenn Beck clip.
[02:13:30.097 --> 02:13:31.380]  I'm not going to play the whole eight minutes.
[02:13:31.380 --> 02:13:40.334]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the article titled, A Meeting, A Message to Glenn Beck, What are the dangers of 9-1-1 Truthers?
[02:13:42.796 --> 02:13:45.939]  And Paul Watson's doing a giant breakdown of this.
[02:13:45.939 --> 02:13:51.964]  Now, remember, I told you 9-11 was going to happen 6 months, 5 months, 4 months, 3 months, 2 months, a month before.
[02:13:51.964 --> 02:13:55.087]  I said they'll blow up the World Trade Center, blame it on their asset of someone, Bin Laden.
[02:13:55.087 --> 02:13:56.708]  How did I know that?
[02:13:56.708 --> 02:14:09.600]  I saw the preparation in the media, introducing Bin Laden, telling you he's going to get you, Rand Corporation saying, when the attack comes, we're going to take your rights, we're going to federalize for your own good, we're going to launch wars, we're going to go into Iraq.
[02:14:10.748 --> 02:14:12.789]  Now you know about the oil meetings.
[02:14:12.789 --> 02:14:20.212]  One month into office in 2001, in February with Cheney, they were already planning all this and talking about a big staged event.
[02:14:20.212 --> 02:14:30.215]  A year before that, in the Rebuilding America's Defenses, September 20th, 2000, Cheney wrote about giant Pearl Harbor level events to launch their New World Order.
[02:14:30.215 --> 02:14:37.138]  And then there's a lot of other evidence goes into it, but in the balance of time, in the interest of time, just simplifying it, boiling it down,
[02:14:41.863 --> 02:14:45.466]  Rendering it down to its basics.
[02:14:45.466 --> 02:15:00.937]  This is a perfect false flag to demonize domestic groups that are against the war, torture, big government, and to demonize 9-11 truth, which the White House-owned Cass Sunstein says is their number one enemy, what Congress under Bush said was their number one enemy.
[02:15:00.937 --> 02:15:06.641]  It gives them the pretext to censor the web, to push through their whole agenda and launch a new war.
[02:15:06.641 --> 02:15:11.085]  So they're going to have a staged assassination attempt of Obama,
[02:15:12.392 --> 02:15:19.341]  In the next year, probably sooner, they may have multiple staged events that build up.
[02:15:19.341 --> 02:15:20.403]  He may even be wounded.
[02:15:20.403 --> 02:15:21.724]  They may even kill him.
[02:15:23.442 --> 02:15:39.965]  To then make him a sacrificial lamb to where who's left in his administration, Joe Biden and others, can do whatever they want with wars, with domestic crackdowns, with the riots that will start if they blame it on a Tea Party slash 9-11 truther.
[02:15:39.965 --> 02:15:45.106]  And I've seen them following this script, getting it ready, building it out, getting everybody ready.
[02:15:45.106 --> 02:15:51.027]  So I'm telling you, in their hand, they've got the war with Iran, they've got nukes, they've got bioweapons.
[02:15:51.027 --> 02:15:52.487]  He signed the executive orders for that.
[02:15:53.561 --> 02:16:10.334]  They've got fake hack attacks on the internet, infrastructure as a pretext to take it over, but the biggest card I see them playing, in their fist, their ace of spades, is to stage an attack on Obama.
[02:16:11.573 --> 02:16:17.437]  And they are getting ready for this to demonize the opposition and bring in a massive crackdown.
[02:16:17.437 --> 02:16:20.159]  And I already was worried about this, but I didn't want to come on air.
[02:16:20.159 --> 02:16:21.880]  I wasn't 100% sure.
[02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:26.783]  But after I've seen what Glenn Beck has had to say and others, clearly they are threatening him.
[02:16:26.783 --> 02:16:28.224]  They are menacing him.
[02:16:28.224 --> 02:16:32.787]  They are letting him know, we can get to you and we will blame it on the opposition.
[02:16:32.787 --> 02:16:38.171]  And Obama's like, but this is political suicide to launch more wars and have another banker take over bailout.
[02:16:38.171 --> 02:16:41.213]  And they're saying you will do this and we will save you.
[02:16:41.933 --> 02:16:44.534]  You attack Iran, we will get you re-elected.
[02:16:44.534 --> 02:16:47.315]  Sarah Palin even said that.
[02:16:47.315 --> 02:16:48.295]  Will Iran against him?
[02:16:48.295 --> 02:16:48.935]  Will he lose?
[02:16:48.935 --> 02:16:53.296]  Depends if he attacks Iran like he needs to, like I think he should.
[02:16:53.296 --> 02:16:54.617]  He needs to declare war.
[02:16:54.617 --> 02:16:57.738]  He needs to play the war card.
[02:16:57.738 --> 02:16:58.358]  Those are quotes!
[02:17:01.223 --> 02:17:10.448]  Now, you can be caught up in Rush Limbaugh-ism, or Sean Hannity-ism, or Barack Obama-ism, it's like I told you foolish Barack Obama supporters, you're being played.
[02:17:10.448 --> 02:17:26.316]  And I'm telling Glenn Beck, Republican Party, Tea Party Nation people being played, you need to wake up and realize that you're the target of Homeland Security, you're the target of NORTHCOM, you are the target of all of this, when Bush was in office, when Clinton was in office, and now that Obama's in office.
[02:17:28.168 --> 02:17:44.501]  So the false flag is kill Obama, or wound him, or try to kill him, but they need to probably at least wound him, to get people rioting, to get everybody at each other's throats, and then they're going to blame it on Islamicists tied in with a Tea Party 9-11 truther.
[02:17:44.501 --> 02:17:53.029]  Now, that doesn't exist, but I've seen them beginning this history, this false history, this ledger, this cutout.
[02:17:53.857 --> 02:18:02.161]  I've seen them with their fake Al-Qaeda spokesman that they upload with the Intel Center and the same Al-Qaeda logo as the Intel Center logo saying, Al-Qaeda.
[02:18:02.161 --> 02:18:07.803]  And there's the grandson of the former head of the ADL, Adam Gadahn.
[02:18:07.803 --> 02:18:09.504]  We work with your militias.
[02:18:09.504 --> 02:18:11.085]  We're going to release anthrax.
[02:18:11.085 --> 02:18:12.205]  We're going to attack you.
[02:18:12.205 --> 02:18:13.846]  We're going to go after your president.
[02:18:13.846 --> 02:18:16.167]  We're going to do this.
[02:18:16.167 --> 02:18:18.268]  See, Al-Qaeda is a cutout.
[02:18:18.268 --> 02:18:20.049]  They attach to whoever they want to attack.
[02:18:20.049 --> 02:18:21.990]  Iran, Iraq,
[02:18:23.988 --> 02:18:35.837]  The American people, Yemen, it is a wholly created government creation to do this.
[02:18:37.927 --> 02:18:42.828]  We're going to go to break, and I'm going to come back, and I'm going to start playing this clip.
[02:18:42.828 --> 02:18:44.048]  And he covers so much.
[02:18:44.048 --> 02:18:46.889]  I mean, this is definitely written by Army PSYOPs.
[02:18:46.889 --> 02:18:49.069]  This is definitely psychological warfare.
[02:18:49.069 --> 02:18:52.930]  This isn't somebody just reading talking points off a teleprompter.
[02:18:52.930 --> 02:18:57.191]  There are so many different forms of psychological warfare wound into this one clip.
[02:18:57.191 --> 02:18:58.231]  That's why I can't watch it.
[02:18:58.231 --> 02:19:06.333]  It makes my brain burn with understanding and realization and just every word he says, everything he twists, his mannerisms, the way he does it.
[02:19:07.588 --> 02:19:20.171]  The way he talks to you like you're a child, the left-right imagery, the way they use chalkboards, the way he has the little stickers that he puts up and then hesitates to post.
[02:19:20.171 --> 02:19:22.871]  It's all done at a child-like level.
[02:19:22.871 --> 02:19:29.973]  The way he implies that communists in the government are the ones undermining the economy to destroy it by design.
[02:19:32.435 --> 02:19:57.574]  When the communists work for the big banks to take over nations, and when the White House, Cass Sunstein, says arrest anybody that's 9-11 truth, and when it was Glenn Beck and George Bush and others that helped ram through the banker bailout, he now says it's communists that want to kill Obama in the White House if he doesn't destroy the economy, when it's a bipartisan group of offshore banks destroying the economy.
[02:19:57.574 --> 02:19:59.015]  I mean, it's just a tissue of fraud.
[02:20:01.897 --> 02:20:06.081]  Get $1,000 in free groceries for only $4.90.
[02:20:06.081 --> 02:20:07.963]  It's true.

[02:21:02.623 --> 02:21:06.670]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:06.670 --> 02:21:09.895]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:09.895 --> 02:21:11.318]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:21:12.020 --> 02:21:15.443]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:15.443 --> 02:21:21.089]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:21.089 --> 02:21:26.153]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:26.153 --> 02:21:36.283]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:21:36.383 --> 02:21:38.724]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:21:38.724 --> 02:21:40.305]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:40.305 --> 02:21:42.766]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:42.766 --> 02:21:44.907]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:44.907 --> 02:21:50.050]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:21:50.050 --> 02:21:55.052]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:22:01.792 --> 02:22:02.813]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:22:02.813 --> 02:22:08.358]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:22:08.358 --> 02:22:08.899]  I get it.
[02:22:08.899 --> 02:22:18.528]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:22:18.528 --> 02:22:19.930]  That's not what's happening.
[02:22:19.930 --> 02:22:24.314]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[02:22:24.514 --> 02:22:26.355]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value.
[02:22:26.355 --> 02:22:28.397]  Or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:22:28.397 --> 02:22:31.779]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:22:31.779 --> 02:22:36.062]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:22:36.062 --> 02:22:37.664]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:22:37.664 --> 02:22:41.066]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[02:22:41.066 --> 02:22:45.429]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:22:45.429 --> 02:22:46.350]  You should too.
[02:22:46.350 --> 02:22:47.491]  Find out what they know.
[02:22:47.491 --> 02:22:50.793]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:22:50.913 --> 02:22:51.374]  800-686-2237 800-686-2237 That's 800-686-2237
[02:23:01.960 --> 02:23:08.644]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[02:23:08.644 --> 02:23:15.049]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:23:15.049 --> 02:23:21.373]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[02:23:21.373 --> 02:23:26.276]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[02:23:26.756 --> 02:23:34.919]  Using AlkaVision pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[02:23:34.919 --> 02:23:39.520]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[02:23:39.520 --> 02:23:43.242]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[02:23:44.182 --> 02:23:49.925]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.

[02:23:53.647 --> 02:23:53.947]  269-409-1776 today!
[02:24:05.123 --> 02:24:13.445]  The good news here is that even Senator Jay Rockefeller is saying, I think Obama's unbelievable to me.
[02:24:13.445 --> 02:24:19.367]  They're getting so desperate that even the leadership of the New World Order are throwing him under the bus.
[02:24:19.367 --> 02:24:27.109]  You can see what they're doing right now because the entire system is losing all credibility.
[02:24:27.109 --> 02:24:29.390]  So they've got the controlled left trying to rein in
[02:24:30.598 --> 02:24:31.118]  We're good to go.
[02:24:50.683 --> 02:24:55.545]  And it appears that he is going to do what they want and go into Iran, attack Iran.
[02:24:55.545 --> 02:24:58.426]  It appears that they don't even care.
[02:24:58.426 --> 02:25:04.828]  They are still setting him up for an assassination attempt to empower him, to empower his memory.
[02:25:04.828 --> 02:25:14.691]  Whether they kill him, God forbid, or whether they just wound him, or whether it's a close assassination attempt, they are going to blame it on the American people.
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:23.563]  Prepare yourselves, get ready for this to happen because Glenn Beck, every other day now, is saying, I just fear for him.
[02:25:23.563 --> 02:25:25.863]  You watch, they're gonna attack him.
[02:25:25.863 --> 02:25:26.864]  They're gonna try to kill him.
[02:25:26.864 --> 02:25:31.706]  Look, there's no security in the White House, the gate crashers, anybody can get in.
[02:25:31.706 --> 02:25:32.486]  They're gonna get him.
[02:25:33.379 --> 02:25:36.824]  The people that are anti-war and 9-11 truth, they're kind of kidding.
[02:25:36.824 --> 02:25:37.765]  They're kind of kidding.
[02:25:37.765 --> 02:25:39.507]  They're now introducing it.
[02:25:39.507 --> 02:25:41.970]  Let's start now with the Glenn Beck clip.
[02:25:41.970 --> 02:25:42.351]  Here it is.
[02:25:51.963 --> 02:25:56.485]  Again, his entire regime is anti-free speech, anti-9-11 truth.
[02:25:56.485 --> 02:26:02.468]  There's no doubt they put Van Jones in to destroy him publicly and tie a communist to 9-11 truth.
[02:26:02.468 --> 02:26:07.350]  But it's true, the globalist regime is in deep trouble, so he tells a lot of truth but then spins it around.
[02:26:07.970 --> 02:26:11.633]  That the regime are a few of the communists in his administration.
[02:26:11.633 --> 02:26:17.277]  When the big banks always use communists to consolidate wealth, Carol Quigley at Georgetown, Bill Clinton's mentor, broke that down.
[02:26:17.277 --> 02:26:18.057]  Continue.
[02:26:18.057 --> 02:26:19.138]  It's collapsing.
[02:26:19.138 --> 02:26:22.681]  It's either going to have to renew itself or it's going to collapse.
[02:26:22.681 --> 02:26:24.342]  Pause again.
[02:26:24.342 --> 02:26:28.285]  They renewed themselves when people got wise to Bush through Obama.
[02:26:28.285 --> 02:26:31.367]  Now they renew themselves with Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin.
[02:26:31.367 --> 02:26:36.150]  Then they renew themselves again with more staged terror attacks.
[02:26:36.150 --> 02:26:36.571]  Continue.
[02:26:37.814 --> 02:26:40.056]  Full of revolutionaries.
[02:26:40.056 --> 02:26:42.738]  Let me show you why the president is in danger.
[02:26:42.738 --> 02:26:45.199]  There are two kinds of radicals.
[02:26:45.199 --> 02:26:46.620]  Pause again.
[02:26:46.620 --> 02:26:48.181]  He builds it up slowly.
[02:26:48.181 --> 02:26:54.205]  And he gives you very simplistic, childlike graphics of this tree.
[02:26:54.205 --> 02:27:00.750]  Okay, he doesn't show you the trees a bunch of banks that openly run the left and right and are playing us off against each other and consolidating power.
[02:27:00.750 --> 02:27:01.491]  No.
[02:27:01.491 --> 02:27:03.192]  It's the different types of revolutionaries.
[02:27:04.264 --> 02:27:07.146]  But the globalists fund all the revolutionaries you're about to see.
[02:27:07.146 --> 02:27:08.706]  Go look at every group he mentions.
[02:27:08.706 --> 02:27:12.949]  Big, tax-free banking foundations fund it.
[02:27:12.949 --> 02:27:13.329]  Continue.
[02:27:25.103 --> 02:27:26.643]  He poses just like the teacher.
[02:27:26.643 --> 02:27:28.904]  He fixes it for you.
[02:27:28.904 --> 02:27:31.865]  He talks to you like you're a fifth grade class.
[02:27:31.865 --> 02:27:34.006]  And he's explaining it to you.
[02:27:34.006 --> 02:27:35.766]  He's distorting for you.
[02:27:35.766 --> 02:27:36.446]  Continue.
[02:27:36.446 --> 02:27:40.087]  Takeover through financial collapse and the reset of the system.
[02:27:40.087 --> 02:27:41.008]  Back that up!
[02:27:41.008 --> 02:27:41.568]  Back that up!
[02:27:41.568 --> 02:27:45.769]  I want to tell you, the revolutionary communist that he's about to cover,
[02:27:47.443 --> 02:27:51.905]  They are taking over through a controlled collapse.
[02:27:51.905 --> 02:27:57.528]  You have a perfectly coordinated Bill Clinton changes the laws for the derivatives.
[02:27:57.528 --> 02:28:01.930]  All the major Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase people continue under Bush.
[02:28:01.930 --> 02:28:03.951]  They put all their money into Obama, continue.
[02:28:03.951 --> 02:28:09.654]  They've now shifted, the New York Times reported, to getting all their money into Republicans because that's the new fake counter-revolution.
[02:28:11.957 --> 02:28:15.741]  So see, he's telling you the bank, not the bankers, are collapsing.
[02:28:15.741 --> 02:28:16.762]  Communists did this.
[02:28:16.762 --> 02:28:19.985]  He goes on to say Obama's people did the economic collapse.
[02:28:19.985 --> 02:28:21.426]  They did the banker bailout.
[02:28:21.426 --> 02:28:26.411]  Not Glenn Beck with White House talking points saying it's not big enough.
[02:28:26.411 --> 02:28:27.532]  We've got to have this.
[02:28:27.532 --> 02:28:28.773]  George Bush is a great man.
[02:28:31.192 --> 02:28:35.575]  See, because there's no difference between him and the established people in the White House.
[02:28:35.575 --> 02:28:38.698]  But he needs to give you that fake image of a difference.
[02:28:38.698 --> 02:28:39.899]  I mean, this is all lies.
[02:28:39.899 --> 02:28:40.779]  This is why I keep stopping.
[02:28:40.779 --> 02:28:43.321]  I mean, it's just all... That's why I can't play these clips here.
[02:28:43.321 --> 02:28:45.203]  Every five seconds is a lie.
[02:28:45.203 --> 02:28:46.844]  Play it again.
[02:28:46.844 --> 02:28:48.605]  There's a Cloward and Piven type.
[02:28:48.605 --> 02:28:54.670]  You know, the one that says there's peaceful takeover through financial collapse and the reset of the system.
[02:28:54.670 --> 02:28:55.271]  Cloward and Piven.
[02:28:56.499 --> 02:28:57.780]  And that went this way.
[02:28:57.780 --> 02:28:59.201]  Acorn.
[02:28:59.201 --> 02:29:03.883]  The other kind has violent radicals.
[02:29:03.883 --> 02:29:06.084]  Now, Acorn caused the financial collapse.
[02:29:06.084 --> 02:29:09.926]  No, they were part of the big foundations getting inner-city people in debt.
[02:29:09.926 --> 02:29:14.669]  As we've had Catherine Austin Fitz on, who was there at the time, telling you how they set it up.
[02:29:14.669 --> 02:29:16.730]  But that was the big banks.
[02:29:16.730 --> 02:29:22.113]  Acorn's just one tiny little thumbnail on the hand.
[02:29:22.113 --> 02:29:24.795]  We're gonna come back and I'm gonna try to play longer clips and then analyze it.
[02:29:24.795 --> 02:29:25.175]  It's just...
[02:29:26.365 --> 02:29:27.466]  That's the thing about Beck.
[02:29:27.466 --> 02:29:32.128]  When you're actually informed, it's all lies.
[02:29:32.128 --> 02:29:37.330]  Oh, he'll be right in saying I'm against government takeover of healthcare, or the government controlling your thermostats.
[02:29:37.330 --> 02:29:43.473]  He doesn't tell you Rick Perry got that through the legislature, and this office now has a remote control thermostat in it.
[02:29:43.473 --> 02:29:45.514]  No, he tells you Rick Perry's gonna save you.
[02:29:45.514 --> 02:29:49.356]  So he'll tell you the problem, but not explain to you who's behind it.
[02:29:49.356 --> 02:29:50.116]  Both parties.
[02:29:50.116 --> 02:29:51.497]  We'll be back.
[02:29:51.497 --> 02:29:52.877]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.877 --> 02:29:54.398]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.373 --> 02:30:02.035]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.035 --> 02:30:06.057]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:06.057 --> 02:30:09.278]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:09.278 --> 02:30:14.100]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:30:14.100 --> 02:30:20.502]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:20.502 --> 02:30:22.723]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:23.263 --> 02:30:23.563]  Tim Geithner?
[02:30:23.563 --> 02:30:24.083]  Bernanke?
[02:30:24.083 --> 02:30:24.743]  They're arsonists!
[02:30:24.743 --> 02:30:26.024]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:26.024 --> 02:30:28.264]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:42.168 --> 02:30:46.532]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[02:30:46.532 --> 02:30:49.434]  we have seen a fall of the republic.

[02:31:00.755 --> 02:31:06.062]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[02:31:06.062 --> 02:31:08.826]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[02:31:08.826 --> 02:31:13.192]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[02:31:15.555 --> 02:31:18.616]  Order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[02:32:01.206 --> 02:32:04.228]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:32:04.228 --> 02:32:09.553]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:32:09.553 --> 02:32:11.594]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:32:11.594 --> 02:32:16.598]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:32:16.598 --> 02:32:17.779]  How much do you want?
[02:32:17.779 --> 02:32:18.920]  When do you want it?
[02:32:18.920 --> 02:32:20.801]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:32:20.801 --> 02:32:21.882]  When will you need it?
[02:32:21.882 --> 02:32:24.084]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:32:24.084 --> 02:32:25.425]  Will there be any food?
[02:32:25.425 --> 02:32:26.726]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:32:26.926 --> 02:32:32.189]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:32:32.189 --> 02:32:35.770]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:32:35.770 --> 02:32:39.592]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:32:39.592 --> 02:32:40.833]  How much will you need?
[02:32:40.833 --> 02:32:41.733]  We don't know.
[02:32:41.733 --> 02:32:42.834]  How much do you want?
[02:32:42.834 --> 02:32:43.775]  All you can get.
[02:32:43.775 --> 02:32:44.575]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:32:44.855 --> 02:32:47.898]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:32:47.898 --> 02:32:49.679]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:32:49.679 --> 02:32:50.760]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:32:50.760 --> 02:32:53.862]  Now again, we're only taking a couple minute clip of Glenn Beckett analyzing.
[02:33:12.113 --> 02:33:19.818]  This is a guy who said that Al-Qaeda had snuck nukes in in 2007, right before the election.
[02:33:19.818 --> 02:33:21.959]  This is a guy who is clearly a psy-op.
[02:33:21.959 --> 02:33:26.842]  He has more open CIA officers on than any other show.
[02:33:26.842 --> 02:33:30.264]  They are there manipulating you.
[02:33:30.264 --> 02:33:31.705]  And he hasn't even gotten to the part yet.
[02:33:31.705 --> 02:33:34.027]  He already said this is why Obama's in danger.
[02:33:34.027 --> 02:33:37.189]  Then he says that 9-11 truth is going to kill him.
[02:33:39.454 --> 02:33:41.795]  I mean, talk about a demonization.
[02:33:41.795 --> 02:33:46.978]  People that question 9-11, incredibly diverse group all over the world.
[02:33:46.978 --> 02:33:54.362]  The number two guy in the Japanese government, all these other world leaders, the former German defense minister, all these engineers, all these people.
[02:33:54.362 --> 02:33:55.122]  We're violent.
[02:33:55.122 --> 02:33:55.762]  We're bad.
[02:33:55.762 --> 02:33:57.543]  We're going to go after Obama.
[02:33:57.543 --> 02:34:00.284]  Total false flag in the making.
[02:34:00.284 --> 02:34:00.885]  Let's continue.
[02:34:01.943 --> 02:34:06.026]  ...of radicals that bombed the Pentagon.
[02:34:06.026 --> 02:34:13.352]  When he was in the newspaper, the New York Times, it was on September 11th, he said this, quote, I don't regret setting bombs.
[02:34:13.352 --> 02:34:15.273]  I feel we didn't do enough.
[02:34:15.273 --> 02:34:20.977]  Paul Watson, I talked about him a couple of days ago, he said this, quote, he's that whale activist.
[02:34:20.977 --> 02:34:25.701]  There's nothing wrong with being a terrorist as long as you win.
[02:34:25.701 --> 02:34:27.502]  Then you write the history.
[02:34:27.502 --> 02:34:28.343]  All right, stop.
[02:34:31.914 --> 02:34:35.275]  Bill Ayers, Patty Hearst, it's all been declassified.
[02:34:35.275 --> 02:34:37.616]  They were working for the government.
[02:34:37.616 --> 02:34:50.640]  They were funded, they were protected, they were allowed to blind police officers, bomb the Pentagon, all of this as a pretext to build up the COINTELPRO spying network on the American people.
[02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:54.582]  It's on record!
[02:34:54.582 --> 02:34:56.703]  Why do you think these people, most of them didn't go to prison?
[02:34:56.703 --> 02:34:58.623]  Why do you think Bill Clinton commuted a bunch of their sentences?
[02:35:01.457 --> 02:35:06.524]  Again, these are high-powered, big-money funded groups.
[02:35:06.524 --> 02:35:11.650]  The Rockefeller Foundation and others all fund the left and the right.
[02:35:11.650 --> 02:35:17.698]  Just like they've been caught in Denver and in areas of Canada like Ottawa.
[02:35:18.593 --> 02:35:27.261]  With paid government operatives dressed up like anarchists attacking crowds of people, and the media says, wow, incredible police restraint.
[02:35:27.261 --> 02:35:30.404]  This just happened yesterday in Canada.
[02:35:30.404 --> 02:35:32.686]  And then it turns out they're cops.
[02:35:32.686 --> 02:35:39.832]  So you see a day or two of people breaking trash cans, hitting cops, the cops are told to stand down, and then a couple days later they attack the peaceful crowds.
[02:35:39.832 --> 02:35:41.233]  People said, well, they had it coming.
[02:35:41.997 --> 02:35:47.519]  And then people are scared to go out and demonstrate because there's always these anarchists there who we've proven are government operatives.
[02:35:47.519 --> 02:35:50.020]  This is on record.
[02:35:50.020 --> 02:35:52.701]  These are rental mobs funded by the big foundations.
[02:35:52.701 --> 02:35:54.041]  Again.
[02:35:54.041 --> 02:35:55.101]  Let's continue.
[02:35:55.101 --> 02:35:55.942]  Got it?
[02:35:55.942 --> 02:35:58.062]  Andy Stern, SEIU president.
[02:35:58.062 --> 02:35:59.903]  Leading White House visitor.
[02:35:59.903 --> 02:36:02.004]  Workers of the world, unite!
[02:36:02.004 --> 02:36:04.384]  It's not just a slogan anymore.
[02:36:04.384 --> 02:36:05.065]  Give me some of these.
[02:36:05.065 --> 02:36:05.985]  Give me some of these pictures.
[02:36:07.076 --> 02:36:09.658]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:36:09.658 --> 02:36:12.040]  Are you like any of these people?
[02:36:12.040 --> 02:36:13.581]  Are you like William Ayers?
[02:36:13.581 --> 02:36:16.223]  We don't regret setting off any bombs.
[02:36:16.223 --> 02:36:17.665]  Hit pause again.
[02:36:17.665 --> 02:36:19.386]  Back it up a few seconds.
[02:36:19.386 --> 02:36:21.628]  See, and like a child, are you like these people?
[02:36:21.628 --> 02:36:24.730]  No, you don't want to be like this guy setting off bombs.
[02:36:24.730 --> 02:36:26.572]  And then he connects it to 9-11 Truth here in a moment.
[02:36:28.151 --> 02:36:30.152]  See, the message is, you're a terrorist.
[02:36:30.152 --> 02:36:32.753]  And then he has this left-right paradigm on the chalkboard.
[02:36:32.753 --> 02:36:35.094]  The left over here, the right over here.
[02:36:35.094 --> 02:36:37.035]  He says America is right of center.
[02:36:37.035 --> 02:36:43.378]  No, in that false paradigm, we're way... Liberals don't... Grassroots are now pro-Second Amendment.
[02:36:43.378 --> 02:36:45.339]  Grassroots, the numbers have shifted.
[02:36:45.339 --> 02:36:46.839]  They're anti-abortion.
[02:36:46.839 --> 02:36:52.342]  Grassroots, so-called mainline liberals, don't like the big banks under Bush or under Obama.
[02:36:53.527 --> 02:37:02.474]  So he always says it's about getting outside the left-right paradigm, using my term I coined, but then every time he shows a graphic, it's a left-right paradigm.
[02:37:02.474 --> 02:37:08.419]  And then he puts all these radicals over on the side of Obama's administration.
[02:37:08.419 --> 02:37:11.321]  Most of them are out there on the fringes, foundation-funded.
[02:37:11.321 --> 02:37:20.348]  He doesn't mention all the big Israeli operatives and British operatives and globalist operatives that are in the White House, who say arrest anyone who has these views.
[02:37:21.405 --> 02:37:21.905]  No.
[02:37:21.905 --> 02:37:23.767]  He gives you the left-right paradigm.
[02:37:23.767 --> 02:37:24.608]  Here it is.
[02:37:24.608 --> 02:37:25.508]  Question.
[02:37:25.508 --> 02:37:28.931]  Do you... Are you like any of these people?
[02:37:28.931 --> 02:37:30.472]  Are you like William Ayers?
[02:37:30.472 --> 02:37:33.134]  We don't regret setting off any bombs.
[02:37:33.134 --> 02:37:34.575]  Are these people like you?
[02:37:34.575 --> 02:37:36.537]  Are they like our founders?
[02:37:36.537 --> 02:37:37.918]  We're normally in the center.
[02:37:37.918 --> 02:37:41.141]  We're actually a country that is center-right, okay?
[02:37:41.141 --> 02:37:42.422]  We don't like the extreme right.
[02:37:42.422 --> 02:37:43.623]  We don't like the extreme left.
[02:37:43.623 --> 02:37:44.443]  We're about here, okay?
[02:37:46.440 --> 02:37:49.683]  Are you like the terrorists or are you like our founders?
[02:37:49.683 --> 02:37:50.863]  Well, wait a minute.
[02:37:50.863 --> 02:37:54.986]  Our founders talked about government staging fake crises.
[02:37:54.986 --> 02:37:57.628]  Our founders said don't get involved in foreign entanglements.
[02:37:57.628 --> 02:38:01.491]  Don't let foreign governments come in and take your government over.
[02:38:01.491 --> 02:38:04.694]  We've had global corporations come in that are bigger than most governments and take over.
[02:38:05.669 --> 02:38:15.857]  Our founders, Glenn, would have supported Ron Paul, not you, who were for the banker takeover bailout, that you go on to blame on the communists.
[02:38:15.857 --> 02:38:18.459]  And certainly they're part of it and they want things to collapse.
[02:38:18.459 --> 02:38:26.045]  But so do the Republicans, and they all worked in tandem, seamless integration between Clinton, Bush, Obama.
[02:38:26.045 --> 02:38:28.046]  But oh no, the Republicans are going to save you.
[02:38:28.046 --> 02:38:31.509]  Again, back to his fake left-right paradigm.
[02:38:31.509 --> 02:38:33.631]  Where would I put a guy who bombed the Pentagon?
[02:38:35.410 --> 02:38:35.610]  Here?
[02:38:35.610 --> 02:38:40.252]  Who doesn't regret and says he didn't do enough?
[02:38:40.252 --> 02:38:41.433]  How about Andy Stern?
[02:38:41.433 --> 02:38:43.274]  Workers of the world, unite!
[02:38:43.274 --> 02:38:44.895]  Is he here?
[02:38:44.895 --> 02:38:47.036]  He's on the extreme left.
[02:38:47.036 --> 02:38:48.096]  Ron Bloom.
[02:38:48.096 --> 02:38:56.121]  This is a guy who said, we kind of agree with Chairman Mao that political power largely comes from the barrel of a gun.
[02:38:56.121 --> 02:38:57.961]  Do you believe that?
[02:38:57.961 --> 02:38:59.542]  I don't largely believe it.
[02:38:59.542 --> 02:39:01.003]  I don't kind of believe it.
[02:39:01.003 --> 02:39:02.204]  I don't believe it.
[02:39:03.709 --> 02:39:04.889]  I think he's over here.
[02:39:04.889 --> 02:39:11.431]  Anita Dunn, one of her favorite political philosophers is Mao.
[02:39:11.431 --> 02:39:24.675]  Yes, and one of David Rockefeller, one of his, and he's on record helping fund News Corp and Clear Channel, on record, so he can control the opposition.
[02:39:24.675 --> 02:39:25.895]  The best way to control is to lead it.
[02:39:28.035 --> 02:39:37.160]  He wrote in 1976, he wrote multiple editorials, but one in 76, praising Mao as one of his favorite philosophers.
[02:39:37.160 --> 02:39:43.324]  Called him a philosopher.
[02:39:43.324 --> 02:39:47.907]  Our government kicked Shanghai Shek out, that's now been declassified.
[02:39:47.907 --> 02:39:50.108]  Our government helped put Lenin in.
[02:39:50.108 --> 02:39:55.651]  And then when Stalin got out of control, he was certainly really bad, and kicked out the Trotskyites, they came over here and
[02:39:57.321 --> 02:40:01.386]  William Crystal's father founded the neoconservative movement that you work for!
[02:40:03.763 --> 02:40:05.744]  I mean, you want to talk about communists in the White House?
[02:40:05.744 --> 02:40:07.825]  Bush had a lot more, but they're not communists.
[02:40:07.825 --> 02:40:10.706]  They use that as a banner to take over societies.
[02:40:10.706 --> 02:40:12.147]  Let's continue.
[02:40:12.147 --> 02:40:15.869]  Now these are just people, these people are in and around the White House.
[02:40:15.869 --> 02:40:22.052]  This guy isn't, but this is where Obama launched his campaign at this man's house for 20 years.
[02:40:22.052 --> 02:40:23.813]  He sat in this man's church.
[02:40:23.813 --> 02:40:29.156]  This man says the government gives people drugs and then wants us to sing God Bless America.
[02:40:29.156 --> 02:40:30.196]  No, no, no!
[02:40:30.196 --> 02:40:31.277]  You know the rest of that.
[02:40:31.957 --> 02:40:33.598]  The government gives us drugs.
[02:40:33.598 --> 02:40:46.642]  See, and they also have the controlled left, like Reverend Wright, come out and say the government created HIV, that's declassified, but never give any evidence, and the government ships the drugs in.
[02:40:46.642 --> 02:40:54.145]  Well, I mean, they had a congressional hearings and the CIA inspector general in 1996 admitted they ship in the majority of the narcotics.
[02:40:54.955 --> 02:41:08.287]  Oh, but see now, if you don't trust the government, and you know the government's shipping drugs in, as Ron Paul exposed in that speech a month ago, and Ron Paul said we've had a CIA coup, and they're shipping the drugs in, oh, you're with Reverend Wright.
[02:41:08.287 --> 02:41:11.470]  See, I'm not a left-winger or a right-winger.
[02:41:11.470 --> 02:41:14.013]  If something's the truth, I talk about it.
[02:41:14.013 --> 02:41:18.557]  And I talk about how big government's the tool of control, whether it's from the fake right or the fake left.
[02:41:20.592 --> 02:41:29.440]  But see, Glenn Beck makes it all a left-wing thing to think the government deals drugs, or the government's engaged in population reduction.
[02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:32.002]  So that the right-wing watching this won't fully wake up.
[02:41:32.002 --> 02:41:40.990]  And the left, in Newsweek and Time, comes out and attacks the right-wing and says, oh look, it's a right-wing thing to believe the UN wants to reduce your numbers.
[02:41:40.990 --> 02:41:42.652]  And to believe the government's dealing drugs.
[02:41:44.076 --> 02:41:48.319]  See, when Bush is in office, it's a left-wing thing to talk about FEMA camps.
[02:41:48.319 --> 02:41:51.542]  When Obama is in office, it's a right-wing thing.
[02:41:51.542 --> 02:41:53.103]  No, it's the truth.
[02:41:53.103 --> 02:41:56.446]  But as long as they can divide you into two groups to fight, they win.
[02:41:56.446 --> 02:41:58.167]  And everything Beck does is that.
[02:41:58.167 --> 02:42:02.290]  So he knows you're waking up to this, so he comes in and says, I'm against the left-right paradigm.
[02:42:02.290 --> 02:42:04.192]  Now here's a graphic of the left-right paradigm.
[02:42:04.192 --> 02:42:04.552]  Continue.
[02:42:06.033 --> 02:42:10.494]  He says it's in the Bible, that's what happens to countries for killing innocent people.
[02:42:10.494 --> 02:42:12.015]  So he's surrounded by radicals.
[02:42:12.015 --> 02:42:13.395]  Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[02:42:13.395 --> 02:42:18.096]  Reverend Wright says that the Arabs attacked us because we were oppressing them.
[02:42:18.096 --> 02:42:22.618]  That's what the big foundation-funded Ward Churchill says.
[02:42:22.618 --> 02:42:24.578]  See, 9-11 Truth never said that.
[02:42:24.578 --> 02:42:26.539]  We know it was staged.
[02:42:26.539 --> 02:42:34.341]  We know radical Muslims are funded to overthrow mainline regimes in the Middle East and Central Asia.
[02:42:34.341 --> 02:42:34.521]  See?
[02:42:37.352 --> 02:42:47.836]  Most of these people he puts up here prop up, like Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn, the official line that 9-11 was not an inside job.
[02:42:47.836 --> 02:42:55.079]  The left, the controlled left, has been the biggest attacker of 9-11 truth.
[02:42:55.079 --> 02:42:56.519]  It's all fraud.
[02:42:56.519 --> 02:43:02.081]  When you know the truth, everything Lindbeck says is a twisted distortion, a spin, or an outright lie.
[02:43:02.081 --> 02:43:03.122]  Continue with this liar.
[02:43:04.483 --> 02:43:05.845]  Surrounded by radicals.
[02:43:05.845 --> 02:43:08.107]  Here's why the republic is in danger.
[02:43:08.107 --> 02:43:11.230]  And the president is in danger first.
[02:43:11.230 --> 02:43:12.291]  Then the republic.
[02:43:12.291 --> 02:43:13.593]  Back it up.
[02:43:13.593 --> 02:43:15.294]  Hit pause, back it up ten seconds.
[02:43:15.294 --> 02:43:17.096]  Here's why the republic's in danger.
[02:43:17.096 --> 02:43:21.961]  Not that big offshore banks that openly want worldwide eugenics and world government are in control.
[02:43:22.762 --> 02:43:26.865]  Not that they've stolen 28 plus trillion and counting in the last year and a half.
[02:43:26.865 --> 02:43:28.327]  Not that it's bipartisan.
[02:43:28.327 --> 02:43:31.910]  Not that Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase own both parties.
[02:43:31.910 --> 02:43:34.732]  Not that NORTHCOM is setting up all these FEMA camps.
[02:43:34.732 --> 02:43:37.274]  Not that they're launching all these wars based on lies.
[02:43:37.274 --> 02:43:42.398]  Not that troops are suddenly running checkpoints all over the country with any excuse they get.
[02:43:42.398 --> 02:43:43.179]  No.
[02:43:43.179 --> 02:43:44.420]  The Republic is in danger.
[02:43:44.420 --> 02:43:46.141]  He now brings you to the ultimate enemy.
[02:43:46.141 --> 02:43:47.242]  You don't like communists.
[02:43:47.242 --> 02:43:48.983]  You don't like these socialists.
[02:43:48.983 --> 02:43:50.585]  You don't like people that bomb the Pentagon.
[02:43:51.203 --> 02:43:55.126]  Who all prop up the official 9-11 story.
[02:43:55.126 --> 02:43:56.488]  Guilt by association.
[02:43:56.488 --> 02:44:06.937]  Now he brings in Van Jones, the only one they kicked out because broken clocks are right twice a day and blind hogs do occasionally find acorns.
[02:44:06.937 --> 02:44:09.639]  Because now he can make it a left-wing issue for 9-11 truth.
[02:44:12.349 --> 02:44:17.693]  When the truth is, it was the libertarians and true constitutionalists that exposed 9-11 from day one.
[02:44:17.693 --> 02:44:20.195]  You're looking at the founder of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[02:44:20.195 --> 02:44:24.918]  I'm the guy that had the nerve to tell the truth before it happened and after it happened.
[02:44:24.918 --> 02:44:31.143]  I understood how important it was to take false flag terror away from these people.
[02:44:31.143 --> 02:44:38.749]  And we've used this radio show as a platform for all the real leaders against the New World Order to build them up to where you now see them as pundits on international television.
[02:44:39.485 --> 02:44:40.506]  Like Webster Tarpley.
[02:44:40.506 --> 02:44:43.348]  From obscurity to being well-known.
[02:44:43.348 --> 02:44:47.131]  Continue with Glenn Beck, because here he comes in with the danger to the Republic.
[02:44:47.131 --> 02:44:48.131]  It's not the big banks.
[02:44:48.131 --> 02:44:50.313]  It's not the New World Order.
[02:44:50.313 --> 02:44:54.476]  It's a few leftists they had in the White House for left cover to pacify the left.
[02:44:54.476 --> 02:44:55.136]  Here it is.
[02:44:55.136 --> 02:44:59.159]  In the Bible, that's what happens to countries for killing innocent people.
[02:44:59.159 --> 02:45:01.281]  So he's surrounded by radicals.
[02:45:03.067 --> 02:45:04.408]  Surrounded by radicals.
[02:45:04.408 --> 02:45:06.009]  Here's why the republic is in danger.
[02:45:06.009 --> 02:45:09.812]  And the president is in danger first.
[02:45:09.812 --> 02:45:10.533]  Then the republic.
[02:45:12.785 --> 02:45:15.326]  Here's this tree of revolution we talked to you about.
[02:45:15.326 --> 02:45:17.246]  Cloward and Piven.
[02:45:17.246 --> 02:45:18.646]  These were the Marxist students.
[02:45:18.646 --> 02:45:21.167]  These were people like this guy.
[02:45:21.167 --> 02:45:23.108]  SDS, okay?
[02:45:23.108 --> 02:45:26.748]  Right here is when they think, yeah, che, that's the way to go.
[02:45:26.748 --> 02:45:28.869]  They want a real revolution.
[02:45:28.869 --> 02:45:30.989]  Guns, blood in the street.
[02:45:30.989 --> 02:45:31.910]  SDS.
[02:45:31.910 --> 02:45:35.831]  Cloward and Piven come along and they say, no, no, no, wait a minute.
[02:45:35.831 --> 02:45:39.352]  We can just infiltrate and collapse the system.
[02:45:39.352 --> 02:45:40.392]  We can overwhelm it.
[02:45:41.312 --> 02:45:46.314]  Those people say yes, Wade Rathke, Dale Rathke, SEIU, ACORN.
[02:45:46.314 --> 02:45:47.594]  They move over in this direction.
[02:45:47.594 --> 02:45:49.374]  They say yes, we'll do it peacefully.
[02:45:49.374 --> 02:45:52.255]  We'll do it peacefully.
[02:45:52.255 --> 02:45:55.156]  So they're going to do it peacefully.
[02:45:55.156 --> 02:45:57.917]  So now it's ACORN that collapsed things.
[02:45:57.917 --> 02:46:00.058]  It's not the big banks.
[02:46:00.058 --> 02:46:01.798]  Glenn Beck's for the banker bailout.
[02:46:01.798 --> 02:46:02.518]  It's ACORN.
[02:46:02.518 --> 02:46:06.139]  Now we know ACORN's bad and involved in all sorts of criminality.
[02:46:06.139 --> 02:46:07.880]  We were exposing it before Glenn Beck was.
[02:46:09.053 --> 02:46:10.213]  This is community organizing.
[02:46:10.213 --> 02:46:12.974]  This is how the government gets you dependent.
[02:46:12.974 --> 02:46:16.296]  But that's a lie that they're behind the collapsing economy.
[02:46:16.296 --> 02:46:17.196]  It's the New World Order.
[02:46:17.196 --> 02:46:18.256]  It's NAFTAGAT.
[02:46:18.256 --> 02:46:23.959]  It's globalization.
[02:46:23.959 --> 02:46:24.919]  And who exposed that?
[02:46:24.919 --> 02:46:26.340]  Who's off the air now?
[02:46:26.340 --> 02:46:27.320]  Lou Dobbs.
[02:46:27.320 --> 02:46:29.101]  Who isn't perfect, but he's for real.
[02:46:29.101 --> 02:46:30.381]  He believes what he's saying.
[02:46:30.381 --> 02:46:32.362]  He's not a globalist.
[02:46:32.362 --> 02:46:34.223]  He's gone.
[02:46:34.223 --> 02:46:35.043]  In comes Glenn Beck.
[02:46:35.848 --> 02:46:36.408]  Let's continue.
[02:47:00.057 --> 02:47:02.879]  Notice, instead of a tree, it should be a pincer beetle.
[02:47:02.879 --> 02:47:04.920]  Google pincer beetle for me.
[02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:05.841]  It's got two pincers.
[02:47:05.841 --> 02:47:12.386]  It grabs its prey in two big mandible claws on the front of its face.
[02:47:12.386 --> 02:47:22.012]  It should be the big banks are financing peaceful takeover while also financing radical takeover as a pretext to bring in a police state to suppress the general public.
[02:47:22.012 --> 02:47:28.517]  But no, you get a stupid tree that has no right-wing control on it, no big foundation control, no nothing.
[02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:30.560]  Continue.
[02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:32.662]  They helped design the stimulus package.
[02:47:53.735 --> 02:48:09.783]  The very same Goldman Sachs that has all its people in the regulatory positions in the private fellow reserve and the treasury and in the White House are the ones that engineered the banker bailout that Republicans and that Bush and Obama supported and that Beck supported.
[02:48:09.783 --> 02:48:14.046]  And they also supported the stimulus.
[02:48:14.046 --> 02:48:21.650]  And now he's telling you that somebody in an office in New York City at some little left cover group supported it and built it?
[02:48:22.881 --> 02:48:23.661]  Total lie!
[02:48:23.661 --> 02:48:24.102]  Continue!
[02:48:42.341 --> 02:49:03.182]  If you have your moment, and you believe that your hero, your revolutionary leader, Barack Obama, has gone soft, and is not going to collapse the system, what makes you think a guy who says, we didn't do enough, what makes you think they won't pick that up now?
[02:49:03.182 --> 02:49:04.163]  They'll do it their way.
[02:49:06.550 --> 02:49:12.163]  They were radical government operatives meant to radicalize people in the 60s and 70s.
[02:49:12.163 --> 02:49:16.092]  They're now big multi-millionaires that write Barack Obama's books.
[02:49:17.034 --> 02:49:22.975]  And they're neokinds, openly running the White House, and they're telling you what they're about to do.
[02:49:22.975 --> 02:49:34.038]  Stage an attack on their minion, their front man, to get everybody feeling sorry for them, and to get everybody loving Obama, so they can ram their agenda through.
[02:49:34.038 --> 02:49:39.320]  You just heard them prep the public for what they're going to do.
[02:49:39.320 --> 02:49:41.360]  And now he gets into 9-11 truth.
[02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:42.900]  Continue.
[02:49:42.900 --> 02:49:44.961]  Now why is the President himself in trouble?
[02:49:46.698 --> 02:49:48.239]  Well, let me use him as an example.
[02:49:48.239 --> 02:49:50.040]  9-11 truther.
[02:49:50.040 --> 02:49:52.702]  Another guy surrounding the president.
[02:49:52.702 --> 02:49:54.103]  Pause.
[02:49:54.103 --> 02:49:56.044]  See, who's the final enemy?
[02:49:56.044 --> 02:49:57.565]  Who's the big boogeyman?
[02:49:57.565 --> 02:49:59.146]  It's not even Al Qaeda.
[02:49:59.146 --> 02:50:00.106]  It's 9-11 truth.
[02:50:00.106 --> 02:50:00.767]  They're violent.
[02:50:00.767 --> 02:50:01.507]  They're gonna bomb.
[02:50:01.507 --> 02:50:02.508]  They're gonna shoot.
[02:50:02.508 --> 02:50:13.855]  When we're the people exposing how government provocateurs or stages events as a pretext to come after you, and we even give you the secret documents that good law enforcement give us,
[02:50:14.235 --> 02:50:20.660]  Where the whole thing is set up for the American people under Bush!
[02:50:20.660 --> 02:50:31.750]  But Glenn Beck won't tell you that, that that MYAC and Homeland Security document that it was written from were put out in 2008 by the Bush Justice Department and the neocon Mukasey.
[02:50:33.922 --> 02:50:39.405]  So at the end of this whole diatribe that he gives you, who is the ultimate enemy?
[02:50:39.405 --> 02:50:40.346]  Who is the danger?
[02:50:40.346 --> 02:50:51.271]  It's 9-11 truth, and why we are a danger to their lie, and to their fraud, and their favorite tool of frame-ups, of staging terror to sell their agenda through fear.
[02:50:51.271 --> 02:51:01.037]  We're going to come back, finish up with this, go to your calls, then I'm getting into a ton of other vital news, the Newsweek attack pieces on myself, two in one week, Beck's attack on Medina, stay with us.
[02:51:02.995 --> 02:51:05.877]  Our economy is in great distress.
[02:51:05.877 --> 02:51:09.420]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[02:51:09.420 --> 02:51:14.944]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen, and prepare just in case it does.
[02:51:14.944 --> 02:51:17.606]  You have auto and home insurance.
[02:51:17.606 --> 02:51:20.828]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[02:51:20.828 --> 02:51:24.111]  Are you prepared to feed your family long term?
[02:51:24.111 --> 02:51:26.773]  Because it might take years to recover.
[02:51:26.773 --> 02:51:32.437]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[02:51:33.291 --> 02:51:40.637]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is offering a package that will give you a 3-acre heirloom vegetable garden anywhere.
[02:51:40.637 --> 02:51:48.744]  50 heirloom varieties, 8,000 vegetable seeds, over 5 pounds of healthy food.
[02:51:48.744 --> 02:51:53.227]  Don't be fooled by marketing companies disguised as patriots.
[02:51:53.227 --> 02:51:59.052]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is owned by Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[02:52:02.080 --> 02:52:06.107]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.107 --> 02:52:09.352]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.352 --> 02:52:10.775]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:52:11.477 --> 02:52:14.900]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.900 --> 02:52:20.524]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.524 --> 02:52:26.088]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.088 --> 02:52:35.716]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:35.836 --> 02:52:38.178]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.178 --> 02:52:39.759]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:39.759 --> 02:52:42.221]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.221 --> 02:52:44.342]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:44.342 --> 02:52:49.506]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:54:06.818 --> 02:54:11.440]  I wouldn't be surprised if Cass Sunstein wasn't riding a lot of what Glenn Beck says.
[02:54:11.440 --> 02:54:13.761]  I mean it when I say it.
[02:54:13.761 --> 02:54:18.483]  But he shows you a tree and says that's the New World Order, a couple communists.
[02:54:18.483 --> 02:54:27.127]  When he should be showing you a pincer beetle, you know, I'm saying stop looking at the pincers, but look at the beetle that comes up and grabs you in its jaws.
[02:54:27.127 --> 02:54:29.208]  The controlled left, the controlled right.
[02:54:29.208 --> 02:54:30.889]  Over there on the right, you got Sarah Palin and
[02:54:32.356 --> 02:54:34.978]  You've got Glenn Beck.
[02:54:34.978 --> 02:54:43.043]  On the fake left, you've got Bill Ayers and Barack Obama.
[02:54:43.043 --> 02:54:47.125]  And it's just that simple, but the ultimate enemy!
[02:54:47.125 --> 02:54:48.466]  They're gonna kill people!
[02:54:48.466 --> 02:54:59.513]  The non-violent 9-11 Truth Movement, the one person who signed a petition once at some rally, they kicked him out, but he goes on to lie and say they run the White House and they're gonna kill Obama!
[02:54:59.513 --> 02:55:00.334]  They're gonna kill him!
[02:55:02.199 --> 02:55:04.381]  Because they want to come after the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[02:55:04.381 --> 02:55:08.104]  They want to try to discredit us because we have broken their favorite mechanism.
[02:55:08.104 --> 02:55:10.646]  But they don't understand that this is backfiring.
[02:55:10.646 --> 02:55:19.733]  All the Newsweek, all the Time Magazine, all the CNN pieces, all the National Geographic and PBS pieces trying to lie about 9-11 Truth.
[02:55:19.733 --> 02:55:21.394]  Everybody's just looking into it now.
[02:55:21.394 --> 02:55:25.237]  But these liars still think they can control people and it's backfiring.
[02:55:25.237 --> 02:55:26.138]  So keep it up, Beck.
[02:55:27.099 --> 02:55:29.120]  See, my possession is the truth.
[02:55:29.120 --> 02:55:32.500]  What I value is the truth, not being a political whore like you.
[02:55:32.500 --> 02:55:42.583]  Beck, I'm sure if you ask around, you'll find out I was basically offered the job you have ten years ago and then again about seven years ago, and I said, no, thank you.
[02:55:42.583 --> 02:55:44.363]  I don't want to be a star.
[02:55:44.363 --> 02:55:47.784]  I want to tell the truth.
[02:55:47.784 --> 02:55:50.265]  And in history, you will be known as Benedict Arnold, pal.
[02:55:51.223 --> 02:55:53.564]  People are finding out very, very quickly what you're doing.
[02:55:53.564 --> 02:55:56.344]  You've only got the most brain-dead people serving you.
[02:55:56.344 --> 02:56:06.027]  And they may not even try to assassinate or stage an assassination on Obama now, because we're doing this and launching a major offensive to expose them, because we understand.
[02:56:06.027 --> 02:56:12.069]  Just like three months before the flu, we came out and said they were going to stage it, because we saw them getting ready for it.
[02:56:12.069 --> 02:56:17.690]  We are taking all your steam out of your engine, the wind out of your sails, punk.
[02:56:17.690 --> 02:56:19.531]  I see right through you, punk.
[02:56:20.788 --> 02:56:23.450]  I know what you are, punk.
[02:56:23.450 --> 02:56:34.539]  And the good news is I warned everybody about what you were going to do and they just keep seeing you do it and they're waking up when you go after Debra Medina and tell us Mr. North American Union, Bilderberg Group, Perry is good.
[02:56:34.539 --> 02:56:34.999]  Continue.
[02:56:37.775 --> 02:56:44.541]  Here's a guy who thought the government was evil enough that it would murder thousands of U.S.
[02:56:44.541 --> 02:56:44.922]  citizens.
[02:56:44.922 --> 02:56:46.763]  Just blow them up!
[02:56:46.763 --> 02:56:49.926]  Destroy a building and kill 3,000 people.
[02:56:49.926 --> 02:56:52.849]  Well, gosh!
[02:56:52.849 --> 02:56:57.453]  Back up where he says the word 9-11 truthers.
[02:56:57.453 --> 02:56:59.996]  We started that about two seconds too late.
[02:57:02.461 --> 02:57:10.147]  We have a so-called government that lets our troops breathe DU, that lets them be basted in Agent Orange and then blocks their treatment.
[02:57:10.147 --> 02:57:15.311]  We have a government that tried to make troops buy their own health insurance out of their own paychecks.
[02:57:15.311 --> 02:57:20.715]  We have a government that isn't a government, but a corporate whorehouse run by offshore banks.
[02:57:20.715 --> 02:57:27.841]  We have a government, according to the Lancet, that killed over a million Iraqis in the last eight years, and a million before that.
[02:57:27.841 --> 02:57:30.563]  We have a government that could care less about third-world people.
[02:57:30.563 --> 02:57:31.864]  They sure don't care about you.
[02:57:34.721 --> 02:57:36.961]  They knew about Pearl Harbor and let it happen.
[02:57:36.961 --> 02:57:38.262]  That's now been declassified.
[02:57:38.262 --> 02:57:40.462]  That isn't saying the Japanese are good.
[02:57:40.462 --> 02:57:44.983]  The point is, they knew and let it happen.
[02:57:44.983 --> 02:57:50.484]  So, these are guys so bad, so dangerous, that they think the government would blow something up.
[02:57:50.484 --> 02:57:51.244]  What will they do?
[02:57:51.244 --> 02:57:57.286]  And then he introduces the idea, maybe hoping some nut goes out to an event and tries it.
[02:57:57.286 --> 02:57:58.886]  You know, they can provocateur it as well.
[02:58:00.572 --> 02:58:06.657]  We're going to come back and finish up with this and go to your phone calls and all the other news I haven't gotten to yet, but this is so important.
[02:58:06.657 --> 02:58:19.207]  I am sure by everything else I've seen and the talk of White House security being lax and all the preparations and the neocon saying you better play the war card, I'm sure that they're getting ready to try this.
[02:58:19.207 --> 02:58:25.232]  Now, it's taken me an hour to break this down.
[02:58:27.153 --> 02:58:28.894]  An hour plus.
[02:58:28.894 --> 02:58:32.796]  See, he does it in about five, six minutes thinking you have no attention span.
[02:58:32.796 --> 02:58:37.799]  I respect you enough to know you'll go back and listen to this, go back and watch this, take notes and research it.
[02:58:37.799 --> 02:58:42.982]  It takes time to break this down.

[02:59:56.426 --> 02:59:59.227]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:06.124 --> 03:00:10.048]  It's not my job to be popular.
[03:00:10.048 --> 03:00:12.510]  It's my job to hit the barbed wire first.
[03:00:14.204 --> 03:00:19.327]  And expose George Bush at the height of his power when he staged those terror attacks his controllers did.
[03:00:19.327 --> 03:00:22.988]  To go after Obama when he had an 85% approval rating.
[03:00:22.988 --> 03:00:27.911]  To go after Glenn Beck when he is the bee's knees, the cat's meow.
[03:00:27.911 --> 03:00:33.073]  It is my job to expose frauds and hope you remember we expose them later.
[03:00:33.073 --> 03:00:38.436]  Because we're always busy exposing the new fraud and don't have time to go back and toot our own horn.
[03:00:39.730 --> 03:00:52.926]  Now, let's continue finishing up with Glenn Beck, and this whole rant he did, ending with, the 9-11 truthers are gonna try to kill Barack Obama.
[03:00:52.926 --> 03:00:59.593]  Just completely made up, out of nowhere, here he is, selling his case, when this is really a threat on Obama.
[03:01:00.666 --> 03:01:07.287]  If they're not already staging it with him just to have a staged, failed attempt to make him the hero and to demonize the American people.
[03:01:07.287 --> 03:01:08.548]  Here it is.
[03:01:08.548 --> 03:01:10.088]  Well, let me use him as an example.
[03:01:10.088 --> 03:01:11.888]  9-11 truther.
[03:01:11.888 --> 03:01:15.509]  Another guy surrounding the president.
[03:01:15.509 --> 03:01:17.289]  Okay, 9-11 truthers.
[03:01:17.289 --> 03:01:24.051]  Here's a guy who thought the government was evil enough that it would murder thousands of U.S.
[03:01:24.051 --> 03:01:24.371]  citizens.
[03:01:25.931 --> 03:01:26.612]  And pause again.
[03:01:26.612 --> 03:01:28.693]  See, he's speaking directly to 9-11 truthers.
[03:01:28.693 --> 03:01:32.336]  Oh look, I'm putting you over here on the sticker board next to all the communist people.
[03:01:32.336 --> 03:01:33.857]  9-11 truthers.
[03:01:33.857 --> 03:01:38.960]  Here's a guy who was evil enough to blow up buildings.
[03:01:38.960 --> 03:01:40.441]  You know, the government.
[03:01:40.441 --> 03:01:42.443]  Obama, you better go after Obama then.
[03:01:43.852 --> 03:01:49.597]  Introducing the idea of killing the President and then going on and saying, we're going to try to do it.
[03:01:49.597 --> 03:01:53.380]  When we're all about non-violence and exposing false flag terror.
[03:01:53.380 --> 03:01:54.361]  Because we get it.
[03:01:54.361 --> 03:02:01.687]  9-11 Truth will kill the New World Order just like Climategate will kill it and is killing it.
[03:02:01.687 --> 03:02:03.708]  We only stand on the truth here.
[03:02:03.708 --> 03:02:07.351]  This isn't some phony right-wing or left-wing show.
[03:02:07.351 --> 03:02:07.792]  Finish up.
[03:02:09.193 --> 03:02:12.355]  Destroy a building and kill 3,000 people.
[03:02:12.355 --> 03:02:15.136]  Well, gosh!
[03:02:15.136 --> 03:02:16.797]  Are these people like you?
[03:02:16.797 --> 03:02:18.838]  Do you think that?
[03:02:18.838 --> 03:02:28.303]  Do you think anyone who does think that we could just kill our own people should be near the president?
[03:02:28.303 --> 03:02:30.024]  Hit pause.
[03:02:30.024 --> 03:02:34.146]  Back that up.
[03:02:34.146 --> 03:02:36.688]  Notice he said, do you think we would do that?
[03:02:38.021 --> 03:02:38.722]  Now it's we.
[03:02:38.722 --> 03:02:41.063]  Now it's the American people did 9-11.
[03:02:41.063 --> 03:02:43.585]  See, all this is psyops.
[03:02:43.585 --> 03:02:44.186]  Every bit of it.
[03:02:44.186 --> 03:02:46.207]  The last thing he covers is 9-11 truth.
[03:02:46.207 --> 03:02:47.468]  It's the end of the story.
[03:02:47.468 --> 03:02:48.349]  It's the payoff.
[03:02:48.349 --> 03:02:49.109]  It's the enemy.
[03:02:49.109 --> 03:02:50.070]  It's the problem.
[03:02:50.070 --> 03:02:56.975]  It's Al Qaeda.
[03:02:56.975 --> 03:02:58.357]  What does that tell you about 9-11 truth?
[03:02:58.357 --> 03:02:59.758]  You better look into it.
[03:02:59.758 --> 03:03:02.460]  There's something really scary here they're afraid of.
[03:03:02.460 --> 03:03:03.120]  Continue.
[03:03:03.120 --> 03:03:03.781]  Do you think that?
[03:03:05.049 --> 03:03:14.356]  Do you think anyone who does think that we could just kill our own people should be near the president?
[03:03:14.356 --> 03:03:22.263]  I mean, he thinks anybody who sits or sat in the chair of the presidency must be evil.
[03:03:22.263 --> 03:03:24.064]  So now he's putting the guilt of 9-11 onto Obama.
[03:03:28.437 --> 03:03:30.379]  And you better license these people.
[03:03:30.379 --> 03:03:34.422]  You better register them, as South Carolina just did.
[03:03:34.422 --> 03:03:37.444]  As Cass Sunstein calls for taxing you or arresting you.
[03:03:37.444 --> 03:03:39.525]  See, this is a criminal group.
[03:03:39.525 --> 03:03:42.387]  They want to kill the President.
[03:03:42.387 --> 03:03:44.289]  No evidence, they just say it.
[03:03:44.289 --> 03:03:47.491]  No, I say it's the neocons and the handlers in the White House.
[03:03:47.491 --> 03:03:55.077]  They're the ones introducing this, and they're the ones that are going to do it, and they're the false flag experts you go to first when this happens.
[03:03:55.077 --> 03:03:56.058]  Put up Glenn Beck.
[03:03:57.000 --> 03:04:00.182]  The president gets shot, he's the first person you go to.
[03:04:00.182 --> 03:04:02.503]  Put up the guy introducing this idea.
[03:04:02.503 --> 03:04:03.064]  There he is.
[03:04:03.064 --> 03:04:08.527]  There's the real guy who works for the people that'll try to whack or stage a whacking of the president.
[03:04:08.527 --> 03:04:11.209]  There's the killer right there if anything happens.
[03:04:11.209 --> 03:04:11.849]  Go back to him.
[03:04:20.294 --> 03:04:22.716]  America didn't do all that in history.
[03:04:22.716 --> 03:04:25.097]  Bad people in our system did.
[03:04:25.097 --> 03:04:28.019]  So again, you question anything in our history, you hate America.
[03:04:28.019 --> 03:04:29.940]  More fraud, more lies, more deception.
[03:04:29.940 --> 03:04:30.480]  We'll come back.
[03:04:30.480 --> 03:04:32.021]  There's one minute left.
[03:04:32.021 --> 03:04:33.522]  Then I'm going to your phone calls.
[03:04:33.522 --> 03:04:35.563]  Got a caller that disagrees, we'll put him to the head of the line.
[03:04:35.563 --> 03:04:37.424]  Then I'm going to get into all this other news.
[03:04:37.424 --> 03:04:37.964]  Stay with us.
[03:04:37.964 --> 03:04:40.426]  This is important.
[03:04:40.426 --> 03:04:43.507]  That's why I've spent an hour and a half on this now.
[03:04:43.507 --> 03:04:43.848]  Because
[03:04:45.220 --> 03:04:50.062]  I recognize the preparations they're making, just like I've told you about all the other things they're going to launch.
[03:04:50.062 --> 03:04:53.984]  I'm telling you, I am sure of this.
[03:04:53.984 --> 03:04:58.525]  And they're going to say that you are a terrorist and that you wanted to kill the President.
[03:04:58.525 --> 03:04:59.706]  That's going to be the new line.
[03:05:01.104 --> 03:05:05.206]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[03:05:05.206 --> 03:05:08.068]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:05:08.068 --> 03:05:10.170]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[03:05:10.170 --> 03:05:12.411]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:05:12.411 --> 03:05:14.072]  And it's available right now to you.
[03:05:14.072 --> 03:05:18.535]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[03:06:00.791 --> 03:06:05.336]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:06:05.336 --> 03:06:06.257]  Number one.
[03:06:06.257 --> 03:06:09.680]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:06:09.680 --> 03:06:10.541]  Number two.
[03:06:10.541 --> 03:06:15.426]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:06:15.426 --> 03:06:16.186]  It's true.
[03:06:16.186 --> 03:06:21.051]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:06:21.051 --> 03:06:21.512]  Number three.
[03:06:21.852 --> 03:06:25.435]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:06:25.435 --> 03:06:30.158]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:06:30.158 --> 03:06:32.920]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:06:32.920 --> 03:06:37.383]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:06:37.383 --> 03:06:41.546]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:06:41.546 --> 03:06:46.310]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:06:46.590 --> 03:06:50.751]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[03:06:56.713 --> 03:06:57.473]  Afraid to answer it?
[03:06:57.473 --> 03:06:58.054]  Afraid to answer your
[03:07:17.892 --> 03:07:18.132]  I think so.

[03:08:02.609 --> 03:08:05.372]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:05.372 --> 03:08:08.274]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:08.274 --> 03:08:10.576]  All right, I've already spent too much time on this.
[03:08:10.576 --> 03:08:12.498]  I want to get to all the other news and take your calls.
[03:08:17.335 --> 03:08:20.498]  But America is becoming a military dictatorship.
[03:08:20.498 --> 03:08:22.820]  The worship of the military is everywhere.
[03:08:22.820 --> 03:08:31.027]  Not the worship of the troops, which is still dangerous, but wrapping the tyranny in the uniform of our military.
[03:08:31.027 --> 03:08:34.450]  Telling us that Iran is becoming a military dictatorship.
[03:08:36.348 --> 03:08:40.470]  The system knows we're waking up here and putting a military dictatorship in place.
[03:08:40.470 --> 03:08:43.331]  And yes, Iran's a military dictatorship.
[03:08:43.331 --> 03:08:44.352]  What do you think the U.S.
[03:08:44.352 --> 03:08:45.052]  is becoming?
[03:08:45.052 --> 03:08:46.433]  What do you think the U.S.
[03:08:46.433 --> 03:08:50.055]  puts in every time it takes over a country is a military dictatorship?
[03:08:50.055 --> 03:08:51.576]  What do you think they want here?
[03:08:51.576 --> 03:08:53.837]  This isn't our government!
[03:08:53.837 --> 03:08:55.858]  Let me say this.
[03:08:55.858 --> 03:09:04.202]  For the sake of argument, go ahead and believe that men in a cave launched the attacks and made NORAD stand down and 9-11 and Iraq had WMDs and all this.
[03:09:05.785 --> 03:09:12.691]  You know Homeland Security, from their own internal documents, is set up for the American people.
[03:09:12.691 --> 03:09:15.433]  You know you're the target, regardless!
[03:09:15.433 --> 03:09:23.780]  We now know the government, the FBI, got the underwear bomber on the plane on Christmas Day and protected him like the witnesses said day one!
[03:09:23.780 --> 03:09:26.843]  They admit they did!
[03:09:26.843 --> 03:09:31.787]  There's seamless integration between the Republicans and the Democrats on these issues.
[03:09:33.646 --> 03:09:37.133]  This is the national security shadow government state.
[03:09:37.133 --> 03:09:38.637]  There's no more time for denial.
[03:09:39.653 --> 03:09:41.934]  But here's Glenn Beck at the end of this big rant.
[03:09:41.934 --> 03:09:43.935]  The number one threat's 9-11 truth.
[03:09:43.935 --> 03:09:45.476]  They're gonna try to kill Obama.
[03:09:45.476 --> 03:09:46.696]  Here it is.
[03:09:46.696 --> 03:09:50.478]  Access to the President of the United States, the guy who has always been evil.
[03:09:50.478 --> 03:09:59.222]  You think now that he was on your side, but now if he goes soft, he's joined the cabal that is capable of murdering people.
[03:09:59.222 --> 03:10:00.843]  He promised you a revolution.
[03:10:00.843 --> 03:10:05.105]  Do you think it's safe to have an individual like that around the President of the United States?
[03:10:05.105 --> 03:10:06.406]  Are you comfortable with that?
[03:10:07.366 --> 03:10:08.587]  Well, let me tell you something.
[03:10:08.587 --> 03:10:10.388]  You might think this is crazy.
[03:10:10.388 --> 03:10:12.209]  All that stuff would never happen.
[03:10:12.209 --> 03:10:18.352]  Let me show you what was said on left-wing radio today, thanks to NewsBusters.org.
[03:10:18.352 --> 03:10:19.953]  They just posted this.
[03:10:19.953 --> 03:10:22.094]  You crazy blank.
[03:10:22.094 --> 03:10:23.595]  You right-wingers.
[03:10:23.595 --> 03:10:29.338]  Do you not understand that the people you hold up as heroes bombed your expletive country?
[03:10:29.798 --> 03:10:43.323]  Do you not understand that Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, and Bill O'Reilly are as complicit of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack as any one of those expletive 15 who came from Saudi Arabia?
[03:10:43.323 --> 03:10:46.505]  Don't you get that?
[03:10:46.505 --> 03:10:55.768]  As a guy... That's enough, O.L.
[03:10:55.768 --> 03:10:56.648]  That's enough, O.L.
[03:10:56.648 --> 03:10:57.749]  He's getting threatened.
[03:10:58.803 --> 03:11:02.784]  He just supports all these wars killing millions of people.
[03:11:02.784 --> 03:11:14.907]  You know, the Dallas Morning News had an article on Sunday titled, Perry supporters caught posting fake pro-Medina comments on Dallas Morning News.
[03:11:14.907 --> 03:11:17.708]  Of course they go out and post fake comments.
[03:11:17.708 --> 03:11:22.089]  Dallas Morning News found it was the same IP addresses of people then supporting Perry.
[03:11:24.602 --> 03:11:28.124]  I mean, they can put out a fake text on the internet and say it's bin Laden.
[03:11:28.124 --> 03:11:28.964]  They do it every week.
[03:11:28.964 --> 03:11:34.607]  It's just so sick how these deceivers operate.
[03:11:34.607 --> 03:11:36.388]  You have been warned, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:11:36.388 --> 03:11:37.989]  You have been warned.
[03:11:37.989 --> 03:11:43.412]  And in every case, when we're about to get a Ron Paul or a Deborah Medina, Glenn Beck is there to try to shoot them down.
[03:11:45.796 --> 03:11:49.057]  To say that the Army needs to be used against Ron Paul supporters in 2007.
[03:11:49.057 --> 03:11:51.518]  That they may want to blow things up.
[03:11:51.518 --> 03:11:52.759]  Remember that?
[03:11:52.759 --> 03:11:54.099]  They want to bomb things.
[03:11:54.099 --> 03:11:55.140]  No evidence?
[03:11:55.140 --> 03:11:56.860]  You can pull the video clips up.
[03:11:56.860 --> 03:12:05.844]  They may want to bomb things.
[03:12:05.844 --> 03:12:07.465]  Because that's what these guys do.
[03:12:07.465 --> 03:12:10.306]  They accuse their enemies of planning to kill people.
[03:12:11.482 --> 03:12:14.305]  They accuse their enemies of being terrorists.
[03:12:14.305 --> 03:12:17.868]  And so, accuse Ron Paul of it.
[03:12:17.868 --> 03:12:19.970]  Accuse 9-11 Truth of it.
[03:12:19.970 --> 03:12:29.278]  Just do whatever you want when it's really your bosses staging the terror attacks.
[03:12:29.278 --> 03:12:31.980]  And saying, we gotta register these 9-11 Truth members.
[03:12:31.980 --> 03:12:35.644]  The lowest polls, 36% of America believes it's an inside job.
[03:12:37.022 --> 03:12:38.442]  That's a five-year-old poll.
[03:12:38.442 --> 03:12:39.383]  I see them all the time.
[03:12:39.383 --> 03:12:40.443]  Scientific polls.
[03:12:40.443 --> 03:12:42.024]  Angus and Reed, New York Times.
[03:12:42.024 --> 03:12:43.584]  Eighty-four percent.
[03:12:43.584 --> 03:12:45.585]  Six of the ten 9-11 commissioners.
[03:12:45.585 --> 03:12:52.347]  This isn't going away, even if you try to stage an assassination of your little puppet, Obama.
[03:12:52.347 --> 03:12:54.188]  We're not going to shut up.
[03:12:54.188 --> 03:12:55.828]  The truth is growing and growing.
[03:12:55.828 --> 03:12:57.429]  You've lost all credibility.
[03:12:57.429 --> 03:13:01.490]  No one believes anything you say.
[03:13:01.490 --> 03:13:04.451]  The few idiots that still buy it are starting to wake up.
[03:13:04.451 --> 03:13:05.632]  All right, let's go to your
[03:13:07.452 --> 03:13:08.252]  Phone calls here.
[03:13:08.252 --> 03:13:09.673]  I appreciate people holding.
[03:13:09.673 --> 03:13:13.015]  I'm gonna move quickly through your calls, so please have your point ready.
[03:13:13.015 --> 03:13:14.816]  Then I've got all this other news.
[03:13:14.816 --> 03:13:18.258]  Obama making plans to use executive power to circumvent states.
[03:13:18.258 --> 03:13:21.139]  Same thing Bush was doing, but expanding it.
[03:13:21.139 --> 03:13:25.982]  Same thing the neocons pushed for in their doctrine, saying the President's God.
[03:13:25.982 --> 03:13:27.843]  You understand what's happening here?
[03:13:27.843 --> 03:13:30.304]  These guys are all puppets.
[03:13:30.304 --> 03:13:31.505]  It's so elementary.
[03:13:31.505 --> 03:13:36.148]  Chris, in California, you're on the air.
[03:13:36.148 --> 03:13:36.708]  Go ahead, Chris.
[03:13:39.127 --> 03:13:40.088]  Alright, Chris is gone.
[03:13:40.088 --> 03:13:42.030]  He's the guy that disagrees.
[03:13:42.030 --> 03:13:44.033]  Let's go to George in Connecticut.
[03:13:44.033 --> 03:13:44.854]  George, you're on the air.
[03:13:51.325 --> 03:13:53.246]  Yeah, these callers have been on hold for an hour.
[03:13:53.246 --> 03:13:55.287]  Just hang up on the entire list of callers.
[03:13:55.287 --> 03:13:58.588]  They can call back in.
[03:13:58.588 --> 03:13:59.609]  800-259-9231.
[03:13:59.609 --> 03:14:00.649]  Just hang them all up.
[03:14:00.649 --> 03:14:02.530]  Folks, you can hold if you want.
[03:14:02.530 --> 03:14:08.313]  We leave the phone lines open, but you gotta be there when we go to you.
[03:14:08.313 --> 03:14:08.733]  800-259-9231.
[03:14:08.733 --> 03:14:15.617]  What do you think of the last hour and a half breakdown I did of just five minutes from Glenn Beck?
[03:14:15.617 --> 03:14:17.958]  And it's all just as bad.
[03:14:17.958 --> 03:14:20.219]  Every form of propaganda and deception and
[03:14:21.124 --> 03:14:23.266]  Manipulation combined.
[03:14:23.266 --> 03:14:24.207]  800-259-9231.
[03:14:24.207 --> 03:14:34.976]  And then I've got all this other, just off the charts, important news.
[03:14:34.976 --> 03:14:37.499]  Collapse of the Euro is inevitable.
[03:14:37.499 --> 03:14:41.202]  Bailing out the Greek economy futile, says French banking chief.
[03:14:42.625 --> 03:14:46.387]  And the Spanish government is looking into this being staged.
[03:14:46.387 --> 03:14:57.934]  It's been all over the news for three months that big banks were going to try to bankrupt Greece, Spain, Portugal, and several other European nations.
[03:14:57.934 --> 03:15:01.335]  They're looting them, just like they tried to bankrupt us in 2008.
[03:15:01.335 --> 03:15:02.636]  Did a pretty good job.
[03:15:02.636 --> 03:15:05.678]  And then they get the bailout money and buy everything up for pennies on the dollar.
[03:15:07.455 --> 03:15:15.576]  And I told you years ago, the plan is to have currency wars between the dollar and between the euro and then say, oh, this has been too horrible after five years of this.
[03:15:15.576 --> 03:15:17.637]  We've got to have a global standardization.
[03:15:17.637 --> 03:15:19.697]  And now the G20 is calling for that.
[03:15:19.697 --> 03:15:21.538]  They had a secret meeting last week.
[03:15:21.538 --> 03:15:32.520]  That was mainstream news in Australia of banks, 24 central banks meeting in secret to chart the future of the world, to rig everything with their insider trading.
[03:15:32.520 --> 03:15:34.600]  Taylor in Iowa, you're on the air.
[03:15:36.348 --> 03:15:37.188]  Alex.
[03:15:37.188 --> 03:15:39.029]  Welcome.
[03:15:39.029 --> 03:15:50.472]  Yeah, I called about almost a month ago and I talked about how I was going to hand out swine flu vaccine flyers for my school.
[03:15:50.472 --> 03:15:56.394]  So I made flyers and I got one other person to help me out.
[03:15:56.394 --> 03:16:03.136]  So we handed it out on the week of the clinic and the clinic was on Friday.
[03:16:04.495 --> 03:16:09.942]  And we handed out about 60 flyers.
[03:16:09.942 --> 03:16:19.894]  So we had some altercations when people read one fact, threw it away or just gave it back to me and said,
[03:16:20.686 --> 03:16:22.367]  It was BS.
[03:16:22.367 --> 03:16:25.129]  Well, at least you tried to warn them.
[03:16:25.129 --> 03:16:28.711]  You slightly warned people Gardasil vaccine was killing people in the trials.
[03:16:28.711 --> 03:16:31.092]  Now it's known and hardly anybody's taking it.
[03:16:31.092 --> 03:16:36.195]  It takes time, but did the school try to restrict your free speech?
[03:16:36.195 --> 03:16:37.396]  No, they didn't at all.
[03:16:37.396 --> 03:16:38.737]  Good!
[03:16:38.737 --> 03:16:44.400]  Yeah, I was actually surprised by that because my school is actually really, really close-minded.
[03:16:44.400 --> 03:16:50.224]  I mean, I live in Iowa and it's one of the most conservative states in the country and
[03:16:51.059 --> 03:16:53.680]  I think the school's really, really close-minded.
[03:16:53.680 --> 03:17:01.483]  Like, I tell them how Obama is calling for martial law and that there's FEMA camps.
[03:17:01.483 --> 03:17:04.544]  And they're like, oh, no, our country wouldn't do that.
[03:17:04.544 --> 03:17:06.625]  We have such a great country.
[03:17:06.625 --> 03:17:08.826]  Our government's protecting us and all that.
[03:17:08.826 --> 03:17:11.447]  I mean, it's all propaganda.
[03:17:11.447 --> 03:17:18.050]  I mean, they had stickers coming out that basically just said, ooh, I'm so cool, I got my flu shot.
[03:17:18.900 --> 03:17:20.821]  It's just all propaganda.
[03:17:20.821 --> 03:17:21.242]  That's right.
[03:17:21.242 --> 03:17:22.122]  They use fads.
[03:17:22.122 --> 03:17:23.623]  Taylor, good job.
[03:17:23.623 --> 03:17:24.264]  Keep it up.
[03:17:24.264 --> 03:17:25.865]  Don't stop.
[03:17:25.865 --> 03:17:27.966]  Let's go to Heather in Indiana.
[03:17:27.966 --> 03:17:28.566]  You're on the air.
[03:17:28.566 --> 03:17:30.748]  Hi, how are you?
[03:17:30.748 --> 03:17:33.810]  We are Prison Planet TV members.
[03:17:33.810 --> 03:17:34.951]  We support you.
[03:17:34.951 --> 03:17:36.091]  We watch your videos.
[03:17:36.091 --> 03:17:38.973]  We show everybody that we can.
[03:17:38.973 --> 03:17:41.515]  We liked seeing you on Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.
[03:17:41.515 --> 03:17:42.075]  It was great.
[03:17:45.174 --> 03:17:49.657]  We've been listening to you the whole time, and everything that you've been saying about Glenn Beck, yeah, we totally agree with you.
[03:17:49.657 --> 03:17:52.239]  We're not Glenn Beck fans at all.
[03:17:52.239 --> 03:18:01.926]  Have a couple family members who were, and then started showing them some of your movies and your iPodcasts that they download and things like that, and now they're beginning to wake up as well.
[03:18:01.926 --> 03:18:03.327]  Awesome.
[03:18:03.327 --> 03:18:08.170]  Yeah, the reason that I'm calling, though, is I'm not trying to steer you away from what you've been talking about, but
[03:18:09.039 --> 03:18:15.515]  We, uh, we have four small children and I have become adamant about wanting to take them out of public school and homeschool them.
[03:18:16.954 --> 03:18:18.815]  There's a whole bunch of cutbacks going on.
[03:18:18.815 --> 03:18:20.675]  They're going to be enlarging classroom sizes.
[03:18:20.675 --> 03:18:22.756]  They can't have the lights on at school.
[03:18:22.756 --> 03:18:23.736]  They're taking away art.
[03:18:23.736 --> 03:18:24.936]  They're taking away music.
[03:18:24.936 --> 03:18:25.776]  Let me stop you.
[03:18:25.776 --> 03:18:26.897]  This is the oldest trick.
[03:18:26.897 --> 03:18:28.077]  Don't fill the potholes.
[03:18:28.077 --> 03:18:30.117]  Don't put new radios in the police cars.
[03:18:30.117 --> 03:18:34.298]  The taxes go up and up and up, but everything goes to interest to the bankers.
[03:18:34.298 --> 03:18:37.939]  All these new taxes, but oh, you can't have the lights on.
[03:18:37.939 --> 03:18:40.060]  Oh, you know, austerity.
[03:18:40.060 --> 03:18:41.920]  It's for the environment.
[03:18:41.920 --> 03:18:42.620]  Absolutely.
[03:18:42.620 --> 03:18:44.261]  Look, we homeschool our children.
[03:18:45.001 --> 03:18:52.020]  If you can do it, even if it means a lifestyle cutback because only one of you can work, it is the best thing to do or put them in a small Christian school.
[03:18:53.499 --> 03:19:07.465]  That's exactly, my husband works, I'm a stay-at-home mom anyway, and two are in school and two are not old enough to be in school yet, but my husband's concern is he shows me these stories that people have their children taken away by the government because they're homeschooled.
[03:19:07.465 --> 03:19:14.628]  That's right, and they're doing that even though there's no law against homeschooling, and the homeschoolers have the highest test scores and the best sociability, everything.
[03:19:14.628 --> 03:19:16.989]  They want to create a chilling effect so you don't.
[03:19:16.989 --> 03:19:20.831]  So you're not living in a free country in your own mind if that keeps you from it.
[03:19:21.371 --> 03:19:22.433]  No.
[03:19:22.433 --> 03:19:25.097]  I wouldn't act like you're doing anything suspicious or bad.
[03:19:25.097 --> 03:19:28.062]  You're homeschooling and that's the end of it.
[03:19:28.062 --> 03:19:31.888]  And you just don't answer the door if the CPS shows up.
[03:19:31.888 --> 03:19:34.933]  But yeah, that is one of these chilling effects they've created.
[03:19:35.806 --> 03:19:44.733]  Well, it's pretty sad when my second grader comes home and she's brilliant and has been doing math for before she was in school.
[03:19:44.733 --> 03:19:52.219]  And it's pretty sad when she brings home math where she could get the same answer, but she's not allowed to get the same answer because it's not their way.
[03:19:52.219 --> 03:19:54.441]  And me and my husband can't even help her anymore.
[03:19:54.441 --> 03:19:56.383]  I mean, it's just... Well, I mean, look, it's simple.
[03:19:56.383 --> 03:20:00.206]  In a free society, you want to raise your own children, and you're afraid to because of the state.
[03:20:01.485 --> 03:20:05.026]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[03:20:05.026 --> 03:20:07.307]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[03:20:07.307 --> 03:20:08.167]  Don't!
[03:20:08.167 --> 03:20:11.608]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[03:20:11.608 --> 03:20:18.750]  Why pay, when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[03:20:18.730 --> 03:20:20.711]  's number one debt secret.
[03:20:20.711 --> 03:20:24.772]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[03:20:24.772 --> 03:20:27.473]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[03:20:27.913 --> 03:20:34.959]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[03:20:34.959 --> 03:20:36.481]  Herb K was right.
[03:20:36.481 --> 03:20:39.664]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[03:20:39.664 --> 03:20:41.025]  What have you got to lose?
[03:20:41.025 --> 03:20:44.148]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money!

[03:20:49.534 --> 03:20:49.574]  888-352-7726.
[03:21:01.309 --> 03:21:11.336]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[03:21:11.336 --> 03:21:17.780]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[03:21:17.780 --> 03:21:26.626]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[03:21:27.006 --> 03:21:36.190]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[03:21:36.190 --> 03:21:41.171]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[03:21:41.171 --> 03:21:42.592]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:21:42.592 --> 03:21:45.093]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[03:21:45.373 --> 03:21:46.414]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.

[03:21:53.939 --> 03:21:56.741]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:56.741 --> 03:21:58.402]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:58.402 --> 03:22:00.043]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:22:12.035 --> 03:22:15.278]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:22:15.278 --> 03:22:20.904]  Tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:20.904 --> 03:22:25.968]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:25.968 --> 03:22:36.078]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:36.198 --> 03:22:38.540]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:38.540 --> 03:22:40.140]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:40.140 --> 03:22:42.582]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:42.582 --> 03:22:44.723]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:44.723 --> 03:22:49.867]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:24:13.348 --> 03:24:20.753]  Coming up, Newsweek attacking yours truly on a weekly basis now.
[03:24:20.753 --> 03:24:29.259]  Want to go over some of their disinfo, what happened with Glenn Beck and his key sabotage or attempted sabotage of Deborah Medina?
[03:24:29.259 --> 03:24:32.881]  I want to get into really even more important news.
[03:24:32.881 --> 03:24:34.082]  Obama just says, look,
[03:24:35.003 --> 03:24:37.825]  I'm going after your guns with executive power.
[03:24:37.825 --> 03:24:40.286]  I'm going after the borders with executive power.
[03:24:40.286 --> 03:24:42.327]  I'm setting up a police state with executive power.
[03:24:42.327 --> 03:24:45.449]  I'm federalizing your police with executive power.
[03:24:45.449 --> 03:24:50.872]  I am doing all of this.
[03:24:50.872 --> 03:24:52.433]  I'm going to launch new wars.
[03:24:52.433 --> 03:24:55.114]  I'm going to pass the greenhouse gas taxes.
[03:24:55.114 --> 03:24:57.335]  I don't need any stinking Congress.
[03:24:57.335 --> 03:24:59.316]  Right now, let's go back to your calls.
[03:24:59.316 --> 03:25:01.017]  Let's talk to Amanda in Florida.
[03:25:01.017 --> 03:25:01.938]  Amanda, you're on the air.
[03:25:02.927 --> 03:25:03.548]  Hi, Alex.
[03:25:03.548 --> 03:25:22.043]  This is kind of off the subject, but my parents are sitting down right now as we speak with a gentleman saying that the government's going to give you a $3,000 credit on your taxes if you put up solar panels, but the catch is you can only use the government-approved companies.
[03:25:22.043 --> 03:25:23.764]  There's about 35 of them.
[03:25:23.764 --> 03:25:27.167]  And he also said that in Hawaii, it's mandatory.
[03:25:27.167 --> 03:25:29.169]  And then he thinks that Florida's going to start
[03:25:29.730 --> 03:25:32.471]  Making it mandatory that you have to put these certain solar panels on it.
[03:25:32.471 --> 03:25:57.665]  Yes, yes, and then it's a boondoggle, and they don't, most of the states have passed it under federal funds, but the states have to tailor the laws to match the feds, and then you, in some states it's only a few companies, and it's a big boondoggle, so it's overpriced, then it costs more than you were told, and they force you to get the health care, they force you to get the solar panels, and then they make you wire that into the regular grid,
[03:25:58.385 --> 03:26:02.408]  And then you just get the quote credit for putting panels on your house.
[03:26:02.408 --> 03:26:04.830]  So they're telling you how to live, what to do.
[03:26:04.830 --> 03:26:06.271]  Oh, it's for the greening.
[03:26:06.271 --> 03:26:08.113]  Oh, it sounds reasonable.
[03:26:08.113 --> 03:26:12.617]  Everybody heard about California passing regulations where the government controls your thermostat.
[03:26:12.617 --> 03:26:16.800]  At first they said, oh, well, we'll just tax you when you use too much power.
[03:26:16.800 --> 03:26:17.501]  Now they're saying no.
[03:26:18.181 --> 03:26:23.428]  We're going to control how hot or how cold your house is, but we'll only do it in power shortages.
[03:26:23.428 --> 03:26:34.863]  Remember Enron got caught six, seven years ago, eight years ago now, wow, almost 10 years ago, jacking up power rates and then having fake blackouts and brownouts to create the perception that there was no power.
[03:26:35.544 --> 03:26:38.106]  Artificial scarcity so people would pay more.
[03:26:38.106 --> 03:26:43.709]  This is all part of the new green tyranny, all based on the lie that carbon dioxide is deadly poison.
[03:26:43.709 --> 03:26:47.392]  So the fraud's exposed, but they're still going ahead with it.
[03:26:47.392 --> 03:26:56.898]  And so, yeah, you better buy my product from me because it's going to be the law anyway soon, instead of you having the option to get your own solar power.
[03:26:56.898 --> 03:27:03.682]  See, if they can make you take the solar systems they want, the solar power systems, then in the future you can't even have the systems you want.
[03:27:03.682 --> 03:27:04.723]  You understand how this works?
[03:27:05.928 --> 03:27:07.148]  Oh, I totally understand.
[03:27:07.148 --> 03:27:16.550]  They even made her fill out a questionnaire about how she feels like, on a scale of one to five, how important it is to try and save our precious oil.
[03:27:16.550 --> 03:27:17.630]  They made her?
[03:27:17.630 --> 03:27:19.410]  I mean, people are so passive now.
[03:27:19.410 --> 03:27:22.871]  I mean, I wouldn't answer the door with some punk salesman.
[03:27:22.871 --> 03:27:25.191]  And I questioned her, and I questioned the salesman.
[03:27:25.191 --> 03:27:30.812]  I said, you need to ask yourself why the government's saying use these companies.
[03:27:30.812 --> 03:27:31.092]  Why?
[03:27:31.092 --> 03:27:32.493]  What's the purpose behind it?
[03:27:32.493 --> 03:27:35.153]  And she's like, well, he showed me a pretty grid that shows that
[03:27:35.888 --> 03:27:40.571]  Only, you know, we use all this electric, but it's only 40% of all the energy that we use.
[03:27:40.571 --> 03:27:43.892]  And I'm like, I could make you a pretty grid and say whatever I want to say on it.
[03:27:43.892 --> 03:27:45.013]  Is that going to make you believe this?
[03:27:46.750 --> 03:27:48.090]  Amanda, it's simple.
[03:27:48.090 --> 03:27:58.352]  They want new ways to tax you to give the money to private banks, and so they're just going to come in and tell you what to buy and what you can use and how you can live to, quote, destroy our industrial society.
[03:27:58.352 --> 03:28:03.494]  And for every green job they create, it destroys two, and the average job costs $700,000 to deliver a $35,000 job.
[03:28:03.494 --> 03:28:04.514]  I appreciate your call.
[03:28:04.514 --> 03:28:05.534]  It's like Austin.
[03:28:11.311 --> 03:28:23.626]  They admit they want to shut down people using cars, so the buses get $150 million a year in tax money and the revenue they make, 1% of Austin uses them, and the roads get $76 million.
[03:28:23.626 --> 03:28:25.929]  The roads get $76 million, the buses $150 million.
[03:28:28.612 --> 03:28:30.133]  This is how the frauds work.
[03:28:30.133 --> 03:28:36.356]  It's a managed economy, where a select group gets to run the bus company, or run the waste management.
[03:28:36.356 --> 03:28:37.757]  It's all about mafia.
[03:28:37.757 --> 03:28:40.058]  It's all about controlled monopolies.
[03:28:40.058 --> 03:28:41.499]  Let's go to Adam in Texas.
[03:28:41.499 --> 03:28:43.580]  You're on the air, Adam.
[03:28:43.580 --> 03:28:45.181]  Hey, Alex Jones.
[03:28:45.181 --> 03:28:47.562]  I just wanted to bring up two fronts on the InfoWar.
[03:28:47.562 --> 03:28:50.744]  The first front is about the energy that she was talking about.
[03:28:50.744 --> 03:28:52.265]  There's technology.
[03:28:52.265 --> 03:28:54.126]  Anybody can go online and look up free energy.
[03:28:54.793 --> 03:28:59.115]  And, uh, the Earth is going through space at so fast, and we can pull energy from that.
[03:28:59.115 --> 03:29:01.016]  Uh, there's something called a GEAT reactor.
[03:29:01.016 --> 03:29:04.517]  Any engineers out there can go online, get the blueprint, and try to build one.
[03:29:04.517 --> 03:29:08.739]  And, uh, once we get this energy, uh, that's the main news on around our neck.
[03:29:08.739 --> 03:29:11.481]  And the other friend I wanted to talk about is, uh, hemp.
[03:29:11.481 --> 03:29:12.681]  How this is a great plant.
[03:29:12.681 --> 03:29:14.202]  They took it away for a reason.
[03:29:14.202 --> 03:29:15.362]  It's very healthy.
[03:29:15.362 --> 03:29:16.563]  It's good for textiles.
[03:29:16.563 --> 03:29:19.084]  And I think that, uh, there's a movie called Run from the Cure.
[03:29:19.577 --> 03:29:23.221]  It's about a man, he's making oil from it, and it's curing cancer and other things.
[03:29:23.221 --> 03:29:24.662]  It's good for the nervous system.
[03:29:24.662 --> 03:29:25.783]  I just wanted to bring up those two things.
[03:29:28.208 --> 03:29:33.549]  There are scores of varieties of hemp with no THC that are better than cotton, better for oil.
[03:29:33.549 --> 03:29:35.930]  You cannot grow them in the U.S.
[03:29:35.930 --> 03:29:41.571]  We're the only country in the world, because of the drug laws, has nothing to do with stopping drugs.
[03:29:41.571 --> 03:29:46.392]  That's why we have How Weed Won the West video, now shipping, available at InfoWars.com.
[03:29:46.392 --> 03:29:49.713]  You can get some free videos and books on that page.
[03:29:49.713 --> 03:29:51.753]  Be sure and check it out.
[03:29:51.753 --> 03:29:53.154]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.154 --> 03:29:54.654]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.669 --> 03:29:58.355]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.789 --> 03:30:04.790]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:30:04.790 --> 03:30:10.132]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:30:10.132 --> 03:30:12.173]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:30:12.173 --> 03:30:17.174]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:30:17.174 --> 03:30:18.355]  How much do you want?
[03:30:18.355 --> 03:30:19.475]  When do you want it?
[03:30:19.475 --> 03:30:21.376]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:30:21.376 --> 03:30:22.436]  When will you need it?
[03:30:22.436 --> 03:30:24.637]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:30:24.637 --> 03:30:25.978]  Will there be any food?
[03:30:25.978 --> 03:30:27.278]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:30:27.498 --> 03:30:32.764]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:30:32.764 --> 03:30:36.349]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:30:36.349 --> 03:30:40.173]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:30:40.173 --> 03:30:41.414]  How much will you need?
[03:30:41.414 --> 03:30:42.316]  We don't know.
[03:30:42.316 --> 03:30:43.417]  How much do you want?
[03:30:43.417 --> 03:30:44.158]  All you can get.
[03:30:44.158 --> 03:30:45.159]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:45.419 --> 03:30:48.481]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:30:48.481 --> 03:30:56.006]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:30:56.006 --> 03:31:03.150]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:31:03.150 --> 03:31:07.173]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:07.173 --> 03:31:10.415]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:10.415 --> 03:31:11.836]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:31:12.512 --> 03:31:15.193]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:31:15.193 --> 03:31:21.576]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:21.576 --> 03:31:26.778]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:26.778 --> 03:31:36.743]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:36.883 --> 03:31:39.225]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:31:39.225 --> 03:31:40.806]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:40.806 --> 03:31:43.269]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:43.269 --> 03:31:45.410]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:45.410 --> 03:31:50.555]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:31:50.555 --> 03:31:55.559]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:31:55.559 --> 03:31:59.663]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:32:01.690 --> 03:32:10.397]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[03:32:10.397 --> 03:32:16.402]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[03:32:16.402 --> 03:32:22.928]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[03:32:23.488 --> 03:32:26.872]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[03:32:26.872 --> 03:32:29.334]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[03:32:29.334 --> 03:32:35.941]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[03:32:35.941 --> 03:32:39.464]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.
[03:32:39.464 --> 03:32:43.328]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-691-2608 or go to HempUSA.org and order today.
[03:32:46.491 --> 03:32:49.652]  The body will react and heal itself given the proper nutrition.
[03:32:49.652 --> 03:32:51.853]  This superfood will be your greatest asset.
[03:32:51.853 --> 03:32:55.514]  So try it today, store it today, and change your life.
[03:32:55.514 --> 03:33:02.216]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[03:33:02.216 --> 03:33:14.561]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio.
[03:33:22.906 --> 03:33:24.627]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:33:24.627 --> 03:33:31.151]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[03:33:31.151 --> 03:33:32.332]  There is so much to cover.
[03:33:32.332 --> 03:33:37.996]  I'm here looking around at all the stacks of news I need to go over today.
[03:33:37.996 --> 03:33:39.537]  Covered quite a bit of it in the first hour.
[03:33:40.831 --> 03:33:45.932]  And yes, I want to try to jam in some more of your calls before this radio broadcast ends.
[03:33:45.932 --> 03:33:48.153]  I have black helicopters over Nashville.
[03:33:48.153 --> 03:33:49.813]  Newsweek attacking yours truly.
[03:33:49.813 --> 03:33:53.514]  I have another Newsweek article here.
[03:33:53.514 --> 03:33:55.674]  Know your conspiracies.
[03:33:55.674 --> 03:34:04.236]  Newsweek's guide to today's trendiest, hippest, and least likely fringe beliefs.
[03:34:04.236 --> 03:34:05.937]  Oh, see, it's about being trendy.
[03:34:05.937 --> 03:34:07.277]  It's about being hippest.
[03:34:10.447 --> 03:34:13.970]  No, that's what the average American tailors their political views to.
[03:34:13.970 --> 03:34:14.751]  What's coolest?
[03:34:14.751 --> 03:34:16.312]  What's cutting edge?
[03:34:16.312 --> 03:34:20.216]  People will even tailor what they say politically to one neighbor to the other.
[03:34:20.216 --> 03:34:22.478]  Not me!
[03:34:22.478 --> 03:34:24.980]  They told you a hundred years ago, no politics and religion.
[03:34:24.980 --> 03:34:26.922]  That destroyed this country.
[03:34:26.922 --> 03:34:28.963]  Don't talk about politics and religion.
[03:34:28.963 --> 03:34:31.666]  Just sit down, shut up, and let banks run everything.
[03:34:36.442 --> 03:34:38.244]  I'm going to go to that here in just a moment.
[03:34:38.244 --> 03:34:45.593]  I wanted to remind TV viewers and radio listeners that we just got a big old truckload of these bad boys in.
[03:34:45.593 --> 03:34:48.396]  Jesse Ventura's American Conspiracies.
[03:34:48.396 --> 03:34:53.963]  You can't get this hardcover book anywhere.
[03:34:53.963 --> 03:34:54.984]  Doesn't come out until March 8th.
[03:34:55.967 --> 03:34:58.409]  You can pre-order it, and we will ship it out to you.
[03:34:58.409 --> 03:35:01.091]  Coming up in early March, you will get it first.
[03:35:01.091 --> 03:35:03.012]  And everywhere else, it's $24.95.
[03:35:03.012 --> 03:35:09.596]  It's $19.95, discounted by $5, and you can get a free video of your choice.
[03:35:09.596 --> 03:35:13.379]  Free film of your choice.
[03:35:13.379 --> 03:35:19.463]  Loose Change Final Cut, an amazing 9-11 film that I helped produce and also consulted on.
[03:35:19.463 --> 03:35:23.266]  I think it's much better than Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[03:35:24.346 --> 03:35:28.227]  I think it's the best of the Loose Change series.
[03:35:28.227 --> 03:35:29.907]  You can get it free.
[03:35:29.907 --> 03:35:31.527]  And sure, you know all about 9-11.
[03:35:31.527 --> 03:35:33.288]  Your friends, your family, your neighbors.
[03:35:33.288 --> 03:35:34.128]  They don't.
[03:35:34.128 --> 03:35:34.708]  Get it?
[03:35:34.708 --> 03:35:36.568]  Have a viewing party, show it to your neighbors.
[03:35:36.568 --> 03:35:37.188]  Get the book.
[03:35:37.188 --> 03:35:39.109]  Read it yourself, give it to somebody.
[03:35:39.109 --> 03:35:40.809]  For those that still read.
[03:35:40.809 --> 03:35:42.609]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[03:35:42.609 --> 03:35:45.610]  You can also get the Aaron Russo documentary interview I did.
[03:35:45.610 --> 03:35:47.590]  It's really a documentary film.
[03:35:47.590 --> 03:35:48.971]  Reflections and Warnings.
[03:35:48.971 --> 03:35:50.031]  Free!
[03:35:50.031 --> 03:35:50.251]  Free!
[03:35:51.411 --> 03:35:58.540]  But when I run out of the loose changes I have and the Aaron Russo films I have, I'm going to print a limited number after that and they're going to be full price.
[03:35:58.540 --> 03:35:58.741]  Okay?
[03:35:59.909 --> 03:36:02.570]  We also have it where you can get t-shirts for $5.95.
[03:36:02.570 --> 03:36:03.511]  That's basically a cost.
[03:36:03.511 --> 03:36:05.752]  I think like a dollar more than it cost me.
[03:36:05.752 --> 03:36:09.613]  So a t-shirt for $5.95 and this book for $24.95.
[03:36:09.613 --> 03:36:12.495]  Together, a book and a t-shirt, $24.95.
[03:36:12.495 --> 03:36:13.995]  Infowars.com.
[03:36:13.995 --> 03:36:20.158]  And yes, even though this is all massively discounted, the money that comes in funds this operation.
[03:36:20.158 --> 03:36:23.900]  So we can not just continue, but grow and do more.
[03:36:24.600 --> 03:36:29.441]  And expand what we're doing here at InfoWars.com.
[03:36:29.441 --> 03:36:32.962]  So be sure you check out the online video bookstore.
[03:36:32.962 --> 03:36:35.063]  This film is now shipping today.
[03:36:35.063 --> 03:36:36.383]  Today's the day.
[03:36:36.383 --> 03:36:38.804]  The 15th of February, 2010.
[03:36:38.804 --> 03:36:40.625]  How Weed Won the West.
[03:36:40.625 --> 03:36:43.365]  Now what this film is about is government drug dealing.
[03:36:43.365 --> 03:36:45.986]  How they ship the drugs into controlled populations.
[03:36:45.986 --> 03:36:47.907]  How they want to pass Codex Alimentarius.
[03:36:47.907 --> 03:36:49.147]  Canada's already doing it.
[03:36:49.147 --> 03:36:52.288]  To restrict regular vitamins and nutrients like their marijuana.
[03:36:53.715 --> 03:36:55.715]  This film is excellent.
[03:36:55.715 --> 03:36:56.696]  How Weed Won the West.
[03:36:56.696 --> 03:36:57.616]  I consulted on it.
[03:36:57.616 --> 03:36:58.396]  I'm in it.
[03:36:58.396 --> 03:37:01.696]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[03:37:01.696 --> 03:37:05.197]  Now shipping, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:37:05.197 --> 03:37:10.038]  But we're half a month away or so from being able to ship the Jesse Ventura book.
[03:37:10.038 --> 03:37:13.939]  So get it first at InfoWars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[03:37:13.939 --> 03:37:14.579]  We tend to get
[03:37:21.872 --> 03:37:22.813]  Acclimated.
[03:37:22.813 --> 03:37:23.774]  Even myself.
[03:37:23.774 --> 03:37:31.040]  I mean, I remember ten years ago, when the mainstream media started saying every child needs an implantable microchip, it was pretty shocking back then.
[03:37:31.040 --> 03:37:32.120]  People got upset about it.
[03:37:32.120 --> 03:37:47.173]  And then, eight years ago, when the Mexican Attorney General made his employees get chips, and then I had police chiefs on who worked for the company as consultants, Bergen County Police Chief, they had police chiefs in the county there in New Jersey, saying I would make everybody take chips,
[03:37:47.833 --> 03:37:48.934]  It was pretty shocking.
[03:37:48.934 --> 03:37:51.736]  Now they announce how people are getting chips and it's no big deal.
[03:37:51.736 --> 03:37:56.039]  They just acclimate you to it, even if you don't like it, they break your will.
[03:37:56.039 --> 03:38:00.822]  We cannot allow them to do that to us on any of these issues.
[03:38:00.822 --> 03:38:12.510]  Kentucky Derby, Super Bowl, then college games, high school games, regular army, Marines, National Guard, Marine Corps checkpoints, looking for drunk drivers, on and on and on, just to condition you to have troops on the streets.
[03:38:14.116 --> 03:38:29.584]  Secret police everywhere, the federalization of police, exchange programs with foreign countries, NLE09 with FEMA, trips from 14 nations, training, FEMA admitted to take on the American people.
[03:38:29.584 --> 03:38:35.927]  They admittedly have built all these FEMA camps and then Glenn Beck gets up and says they don't exist.
[03:38:35.927 --> 03:38:36.828]  You're being acclimated.
[03:38:38.886 --> 03:38:45.610]  And everything they've been building in the police state architecture since the establishment killed Kennedy.
[03:38:45.610 --> 03:38:47.891]  And he wasn't perfect, but he wasn't going along with it.
[03:38:47.891 --> 03:39:02.900]  They've been slowly building and federalizing and slowly setting it up, where if you think executive orders outside of Congress and the courts making unconstitutional regulatory laws, where the regulatory agencies do what the president says and the law be damned,
[03:39:04.764 --> 03:39:13.986]  If you think all of that is bad, what about the signing statements that Clinton started, Bush started expanding it, now Obama who swore he wouldn't do it.
[03:39:13.986 --> 03:39:15.707]  We've all seen those video clips.
[03:39:15.707 --> 03:39:23.008]  In fact, do you have the signing statement clip, guys, I asked you to get?
[03:39:23.008 --> 03:39:26.269]  Remember that?
[03:39:26.269 --> 03:39:29.890]  Remember how he promised that they
[03:39:32.219 --> 03:39:36.982]  Would never use signing statements of any type because it's unconstitutional?
[03:39:36.982 --> 03:39:39.264]  Because it's a federal power grab?
[03:39:39.264 --> 03:39:43.947]  If you guys are looking for it again, it's in the article.
[03:39:43.947 --> 03:39:44.367]  You have it?
[03:39:44.367 --> 03:39:47.449]  Let's go ahead and play this short clip before I get into this.
[03:39:47.449 --> 03:39:48.409]  Here it is.
[03:39:48.409 --> 03:39:51.872]  Congress offers you a bill.
[03:39:51.872 --> 03:39:55.314]  Do you promise not to use presidential signage to get your way?
[03:40:06.031 --> 03:40:10.773]  Let me just explain for those who are unfamiliar with this issue.
[03:40:10.773 --> 03:40:17.615]  We've got a government designed by the founders so that there'd be checks and balances.
[03:40:17.615 --> 03:40:22.177]  You don't want a president who's too powerful, or a congress who's too powerful, or a court who's too powerful.
[03:40:22.177 --> 03:40:24.818]  Everybody's got their own role.
[03:40:24.818 --> 03:40:27.599]  Congress's job is to pass legislation.
[03:40:27.599 --> 03:40:29.620]  The president can veto it, or he can sign it.
[03:40:30.305 --> 03:40:48.571]  But what George Bush has been trying to do as part of his effort to accumulate more power in the presidency is he's been saying, well I can basically change what Congress passed by attaching a letter saying, I don't agree with this part or I don't agree with that part.
[03:40:48.571 --> 03:40:52.312]  I'm going to choose to interpret it this way or that way.
[03:40:52.312 --> 03:40:54.093]  That's not part of his power.
[03:40:54.093 --> 03:40:59.255]  But this is part of the whole theory of George Bush that he can make laws as he's going along.
[03:41:00.383 --> 03:41:01.804]  I disagree with that.
[03:41:01.804 --> 03:41:04.166]  I taught the Constitution for 10 years.
[03:41:04.166 --> 03:41:08.250]  I believe in the Constitution and I will obey the Constitution of the United States.
[03:41:08.250 --> 03:41:12.673]  We're not going to use signing statements as a way of doing an end run around Congress.
[03:41:12.673 --> 03:41:14.255]  Alright?
[03:41:14.255 --> 03:41:15.816]  Alright?
[03:41:15.816 --> 03:41:18.038]  Everything he says is a lie.
[03:41:18.038 --> 03:41:22.401]  Just like everything Glenn Beck says is a lie.
[03:41:22.401 --> 03:41:28.667]  He says a couple communists imploded the banking structure when he supported the banker takeover.
[03:41:29.542 --> 03:41:33.767]  Same thing with Obama.
[03:41:33.767 --> 03:41:41.215]  Most of the people in the Bush administration stayed over into Obama's administration.
[03:41:41.215 --> 03:41:44.379]  And that's what I tried to explain in the Obama Deception Fall of the Republic.
[03:41:44.379 --> 03:41:47.823]  That's why those films are more important today than when I made them last year.
[03:41:49.244 --> 03:41:55.487]  Because you can set a Republican down or a Democrat down in front of those films and then there won't be any more confusion.
[03:41:55.487 --> 03:41:57.228]  They'll understand the bigger ball game.
[03:41:57.228 --> 03:41:59.169]  Instead of being conned!
[03:41:59.169 --> 03:42:10.434]  Now, Obama says he doesn't care if the Congress doesn't pass a greenhouse gas tax that will completely shut down what's left of our industry, double the amount that electricity costs.
[03:42:10.434 --> 03:42:12.355]  He even admits that in a video clip.
[03:42:12.355 --> 03:42:14.836]  Double your electricity bill.
[03:42:14.836 --> 03:42:16.376]  That's not me just saying that.
[03:42:16.376 --> 03:42:17.257]  That's on record.
[03:42:18.936 --> 03:42:21.397]  That he wants to, quote, bankrupt them.
[03:42:21.397 --> 03:42:31.981]  And China, and India, and Mexico, and 100 plus other countries, it's 160 total, 165 total, they don't have to make any cuts.
[03:42:31.981 --> 03:42:36.403]  So even if you believe carbon dioxide's so deadly and we're burning up and everybody's gonna die,
[03:42:38.072 --> 03:42:48.997]  How does China and India and Mexico, who will put out even dirtier emissions, how does that save the earth when the total numbers of the devilish carbon dioxide goes up?
[03:42:48.997 --> 03:42:50.538]  I mean, this is common sense.
[03:42:50.538 --> 03:42:52.899]  But again, he says gun control.
[03:42:52.899 --> 03:42:53.880]  He announced that last month.
[03:42:53.880 --> 03:42:56.001]  They're going to go through the UN with treaties.
[03:42:57.048 --> 03:43:00.630]  And even if Congress won't ratify it, the Senate won't ratify it, he's going to do it.
[03:43:00.630 --> 03:43:01.590]  Open borders!
[03:43:01.590 --> 03:43:03.111]  Through SPP!
[03:43:03.111 --> 03:43:05.752]  He's saying he's going to go for open borders on that.
[03:43:05.752 --> 03:43:12.516]  The executive branch is already issuing hemispheric North American... What was the exact name of it?
[03:43:12.516 --> 03:43:13.796]  Most of you have seen it.
[03:43:13.796 --> 03:43:16.518]  What was the exact name of it?
[03:43:16.518 --> 03:43:21.240]  Most of you have seen it.
[03:43:21.240 --> 03:43:24.021]  What was the exact name of it?
[03:43:24.021 --> 03:43:24.862]  North American...
[03:43:27.339 --> 03:43:30.001]  ID commercial.
[03:43:30.001 --> 03:43:31.663]  It's like a 60-second ad.
[03:43:31.663 --> 03:43:34.685]  America, the beautiful, the wondrous.
[03:43:34.685 --> 03:43:37.247]  Now you can travel from Mexico to Canada and the U.S.
[03:43:37.247 --> 03:43:39.329]  with this card.
[03:43:39.329 --> 03:43:41.951]  They're just doing it.
[03:43:41.951 --> 03:43:45.534]  North American hemisphere IDs.
[03:43:48.618 --> 03:43:50.440]  And it goes on and on and on.
[03:43:50.440 --> 03:43:52.001]  The federalization of police.
[03:43:52.001 --> 03:43:53.523]  Shutting down a gun show in Austin.
[03:43:53.523 --> 03:43:55.244]  Now other gun shows around the country.
[03:43:55.244 --> 03:43:55.785]  No law.
[03:43:55.785 --> 03:43:58.528]  The BATF just shows up and says that's the way it is.
[03:44:00.128 --> 03:44:03.249]  You got the Austin Police Chief constantly meeting with the ADL.
[03:44:03.249 --> 03:44:09.232]  Some bizarre libertarian blog attacks me and talks about how they go to the ADL meetings.
[03:44:09.232 --> 03:44:17.776]  No wonder when I showed up at that protest and they were running it, they freaked out and caused that whole thing and ran up and said, you're not welcome here when it was all my audience, people in my t-shirt showing up.
[03:44:17.776 --> 03:44:20.077]  And I was like, well, I'm going to bullhorn the media here.
[03:44:20.077 --> 03:44:24.418]  Now I find out they're writing articles about how great the ADL is and how they meet with them and how I'm bad.
[03:44:24.418 --> 03:44:27.120]  I mean, it's just you can't believe this stuff.
[03:44:27.120 --> 03:44:28.020]  They're just everywhere.
[03:44:32.842 --> 03:44:40.085]  Obama making plans to use executive power.
[03:44:40.085 --> 03:44:51.729]  With much of his legislative agenda stalled in Congress, President Obama and his team are preparing an array of actions used to his executive power to advance energy, environmental, fiscal, and other domestic policy priorities.
[03:44:51.729 --> 03:44:52.970]  That's the New York Times.
[03:44:54.656 --> 03:44:57.639]  And it says we will use executive orders and signing statements.
[03:44:57.639 --> 03:44:58.680]  He's already doing it.
[03:44:58.680 --> 03:45:09.090]  We are reviewing a list of presidential executive orders and directives to get the job done across a front of issues, said Rahm Emanuel, who isn't even American, to the White House Chief of Staff.
[03:45:09.090 --> 03:45:11.233]  I mean, he is an admitted member of the IDF.
[03:45:12.133 --> 03:45:13.253]  Not even an Israel firster.
[03:45:13.253 --> 03:45:13.853]  He's an Israeli.
[03:45:13.853 --> 03:45:14.694]  And that's wrong.
[03:45:14.694 --> 03:45:17.194]  It's like Schwarzenegger's wrong for governor.
[03:45:17.194 --> 03:45:22.495]  Any president has vast authority to influence policy without legislation through executive orders.
[03:45:22.495 --> 03:45:24.776]  Agency rulemaking and administration fiat.
[03:45:24.776 --> 03:45:28.657]  That's why they have Cass Sunstein in there as the head of this.
[03:45:28.657 --> 03:45:33.958]  The guy that says there should be no free speech and no internet free speech and now you hear it being announced by the media.
[03:45:35.697 --> 03:45:37.799]  And they tell you, oh, the President's allowed to do this.
[03:45:37.799 --> 03:45:38.919]  No, he's not!
[03:45:38.919 --> 03:45:41.401]  You just heard the President say, it's wrong.
[03:45:41.401 --> 03:45:42.542]  It's unconstitutional.
[03:45:42.542 --> 03:45:47.345]  It's illegal.
[03:45:47.345 --> 03:45:49.227]  And here's the key articles by Kurt Nimmo.
[03:45:49.227 --> 03:45:54.030]  Obama declares he will rule by authoritarian decree.
[03:45:54.030 --> 03:45:55.371]  Infowars.com.
[03:45:55.371 --> 03:45:56.092]  This is important.
[03:45:56.092 --> 03:45:56.872]  Get it out to everybody.
[03:45:56.872 --> 03:45:57.833]  Kurt Nimmo.
[03:45:57.833 --> 03:46:03.477]  The Obama administration has announced it will now rule by fascist decree and ignore Congress and the American people.
[03:46:10.666 --> 03:46:16.067]  And it goes on to say the fact that Obama's plan to rule by authoritarian decree is unconstitutional.
[03:46:16.067 --> 03:46:18.148]  Article 1, Section 1 of the U.S.
[03:46:18.148 --> 03:46:26.930]  Constitution states, all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in Congress of the United States, which shall consist of the Senate and the House of Representatives.
[03:46:26.930 --> 03:46:32.692]  Article 2, Section 3 states that the President may call Congress into emergency session during a national crisis.
[03:46:34.249 --> 03:46:36.810]  In other words, rule by fiat is treason.
[03:46:36.810 --> 03:46:39.091]  Another section of the Constitution covers treason.
[03:46:39.091 --> 03:46:49.935]  Article 2, Section 4 states the President, Vice President, and all civil officers of the United States shall be removed from office of impeachment for and convicted of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.
[03:46:50.990 --> 03:46:57.014]  Rahm Emanuel should be arrested and prosecuted for treason under federal statutes, specifically Title 18 U.S.C.
[03:46:57.014 --> 03:46:58.115]  2.
[03:46:58.115 --> 03:47:11.763]  It states, whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures its commission is punishable as a principle.
[03:47:11.763 --> 03:47:14.825]  Treason is spelled out in Article 3, Section 3 of the Constitution.
[03:47:14.825 --> 03:47:19.969]  Quote, the Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, it states.
[03:47:19.969 --> 03:47:20.349]  Right there.
[03:47:23.035 --> 03:47:23.995]  Another great article.
[03:47:23.995 --> 03:47:27.597]  Obama breaks yet another campaign promise.
[03:47:27.597 --> 03:47:29.778]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:29.778 --> 03:47:40.143]  In the face of rapidly growing populist anger, the Obama administration has signaled that it will fall back on a form of power well known to all successful dictators.
[03:47:40.143 --> 03:47:41.424]  Rule by decree.
[03:47:41.424 --> 03:47:49.288]  And Obama will use the very instrument he campaigned against to ram through the New World Order agenda, executive orders, and lots of them.
[03:47:50.768 --> 03:47:56.071]  This is the definition of tyrannous.
[03:47:56.071 --> 03:47:58.753]  And this isn't like executive orders.
[03:47:58.753 --> 03:48:06.998]  Congress would give the president his pay and his funding for the executive office of the president in the White House.
[03:48:06.998 --> 03:48:14.723]  And it was the first executive orders were like, Martha Washington, what type of plates and silverware she was going to buy.
[03:48:14.723 --> 03:48:20.107]  And complaining she couldn't get more than a couple hundred dollars to entertain dignitaries.
[03:48:21.624 --> 03:48:26.905]  Now it's, oh, I signed an executive order, there's all these taxes, and we're gonna shut down the power plants.
[03:48:26.905 --> 03:48:29.785]  Oh, I signed an executive order, we're federalizing your police.
[03:48:29.785 --> 03:48:32.626]  I'm signing an executive order, we're gonna spy on you without warrants.
[03:48:32.626 --> 03:48:43.848]  I'm signing an executive order, we're gonna issue a hemispheric travel ID card that's good in Mexico and Canada, and both countries are part of it.
[03:48:43.848 --> 03:48:48.649]  We'll cover this more tomorrow.
[03:48:48.649 --> 03:48:50.789]  In other news,
[03:48:51.971 --> 03:48:58.476]  We already talked a lot about this but we'll take calls on it tomorrow because it's such an example of sabotage.
[03:48:58.476 --> 03:49:01.619]  Glenn Beck with the Perry campaign.
[03:49:02.830 --> 03:49:07.453]  Within 35 minutes, they already had robocalls going out that she's a 9-11 traitor.
[03:49:07.453 --> 03:49:10.775]  When I never asked her about that on air, she never talked about 9-11 traitors.
[03:49:10.775 --> 03:49:19.500]  She talked about getting rid of property taxes, securing the border, having open carry, and all these little neocon listeners go, well, I don't like her now if she's like that.
[03:49:19.500 --> 03:49:22.902]  But she got a lot of other supporters who didn't support her beforehand.
[03:49:22.902 --> 03:49:26.784]  You know, I'm going to go with Perry, the North American Union Bilderberg group member.
[03:49:26.784 --> 03:49:28.585]  But notice where this came from.
[03:49:28.585 --> 03:49:29.565]  Glenn Beck.
[03:49:29.565 --> 03:49:31.146]  The attacks on Paul.
[03:49:31.146 --> 03:49:31.667]  Glenn Beck.
[03:49:32.509 --> 03:49:41.533]  He still calls him a kook, then has him on TV and acts like he's his friend.
[03:49:41.533 --> 03:49:45.055]  They're there to make sure there's not a real revolution at the state level.
[03:49:45.055 --> 03:49:47.996]  Just like all the Republicans that are going to get in office in the election coming up.
[03:49:49.099 --> 03:50:11.127]  In Congress, later this year, they'll be led by a Newt Gingrich type, by the way he supports the global carbon taxes, another globalist, they'll be led by another Newt Gingrich type, right down a rat hole, because it's the system's job, and they do it worldwide, they're experts at it, to play groups off against each other and sabotage any real change towards freedom, transparency, and smaller government.
[03:50:11.127 --> 03:50:13.588]  And you're going to get more banker bailouts, and at key points,
[03:50:15.697 --> 03:50:19.558]  Glenn Obama Beck is going to support him.
[03:50:19.558 --> 03:50:24.340]  And then he'll get up later and say communists got it passed.
[03:50:24.340 --> 03:50:27.100]  I'm telling you, that's why I spend time on him now.
[03:50:27.100 --> 03:50:35.983]  Because he is outrageously transparent and outrageously dangerous and outrageously slippery to the uninitiated who don't understand how these things work.
[03:50:39.138 --> 03:50:41.420]  We're gonna come back, get into the Newsweek hit pieces.
[03:50:41.420 --> 03:50:42.561]  I'll cover this more tomorrow.
[03:50:42.561 --> 03:50:43.562]  I meant to get to it earlier.
[03:50:43.562 --> 03:50:46.405]  I just spent an hour and a half breaking down Beck.
[03:50:46.405 --> 03:50:50.989]  And the fact that I'm sure of it, they're gonna try to stage an assassination attempt on Obama.
[03:50:50.989 --> 03:50:51.870]  Run out of the White House.
[03:50:51.870 --> 03:50:53.151]  It'll be fake.
[03:50:53.151 --> 03:50:56.034]  And I see the neocons pre-positioning all this.
[03:50:56.034 --> 03:50:58.456]  Obama completely works for them.
[03:50:58.456 --> 03:51:03.341]  They're just trying to give you a false choice between the Republicans and Obama, so you think that's the whole ballgame.
[03:51:05.558 --> 03:51:08.540]  If you like vitamins, say ilikevitamins.com!
[03:51:08.540 --> 03:51:10.341]  Vitamin lovers, it's your choice!

[03:51:45.526 --> 03:51:47.567]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:51:47.567 --> 03:51:49.367]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:51:49.367 --> 03:51:50.988]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:15.643 --> 03:52:18.326]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:18.326 --> 03:52:24.712]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:24.712 --> 03:52:30.257]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:30.257 --> 03:52:39.886]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:39.986 --> 03:52:42.347]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:42.347 --> 03:52:43.927]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:43.927 --> 03:52:46.388]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:46.388 --> 03:52:48.509]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:48.509 --> 03:52:53.670]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:53.670 --> 03:52:58.672]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[03:53:05.174 --> 03:53:06.614]  Hey everybody, Alex Jones here.
[03:53:09.206 --> 03:53:09.907]  Listen up.
[03:53:09.907 --> 03:53:12.849]  This will make your holiday shopping very easy.
[03:53:12.849 --> 03:53:18.854]  This year, give a seed bank from one of our oldest sponsors, Solutions from Science, to your friends and family.
[03:53:18.854 --> 03:53:19.594]  Here's why.
[03:53:19.594 --> 03:53:27.801]  The Survival Seed Bank will give any friend or loved one the ability to grow a full acre crisis garden of nutritionally dense, life-sustaining food.
[03:53:27.801 --> 03:53:31.844]  And the Survival Seed Bank is not just a box of open-pollinated seeds.
[03:53:31.844 --> 03:53:37.728]  It's an indestructible, waterproof seed bank that can even be buried if we face a real meltdown.
[03:53:37.728 --> 03:53:38.589]  And here's the best part.
[03:53:39.236 --> 03:53:46.781]  All the seeds in the Survival Seed Bank go through strict germination testing so you can be confident you're not buying old seeds.
[03:53:46.781 --> 03:53:51.084]  Give a Survival Seed Bank this Christmas by going to survivalseedbank.com.
[03:53:51.084 --> 03:53:53.166]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:53:53.166 --> 03:53:57.248]  Or you can call 877-327-0365 to give the gift that produces an ongoing supply of life-sustaining food.
[03:54:08.646 --> 03:54:14.029]  This Jonathan Kaye about a year ago called me from the National Post newspaper in Canada.
[03:54:14.029 --> 03:54:16.451]  He said, I promise it's not a hit piece.
[03:54:16.451 --> 03:54:17.752]  I just want to understand you.
[03:54:17.752 --> 03:54:21.094]  I want to come down to your office and hang out with you for a few days.
[03:54:21.094 --> 03:54:22.915]  And I said, no.
[03:54:22.915 --> 03:54:26.377]  I've seen your articles about 9-11 truth.
[03:54:26.377 --> 03:54:27.198]  I don't want to be part of it.
[03:54:28.848 --> 03:54:32.691]  They just want to meet with me so they can claim they actually came and interviewed me.
[03:54:32.691 --> 03:54:33.551]  And it's the same thing.
[03:54:33.551 --> 03:54:36.973]  He wrote this article for Newsweek, Black Helicopters Over Nashville.
[03:54:36.973 --> 03:54:40.536]  We'll give folks a close shot of this.
[03:54:40.536 --> 03:54:55.206]  And you get into it, it says, This worldview modern-day prophets include, Texas radio host Alex Jones's documentary, The Obama Deception Claims Obama Candidacy Was a Plot by Leaders of the New World Order to Con the American People into Accepting Global Slavery.
[03:54:56.937 --> 03:55:03.099]  Christian Evangelist Pat Robertson and the right-hand strain of the aforementioned 9-11 Truth Movement.
[03:55:03.099 --> 03:55:09.801]  As if we're Pat Robertson who said Obama couldn't be opposed and was of God, that we would accept socialism and it was good.
[03:55:09.801 --> 03:55:11.382]  Remember that clip from last year?
[03:55:11.382 --> 03:55:14.503]  According to the Dark Vision, America's 21st century
[03:55:16.533 --> 03:55:17.234]  We're good to go.
[03:55:33.220 --> 03:55:40.966]  He links to its website, explains he's just a puppet front man and they want carbon taxes to fund them, which is what they openly announced to world government.
[03:55:40.966 --> 03:55:49.392]  I mean, I'm a kook because I listen to what Herman Von Ruppe, the head of the EU, and Ban Ki-moon writes in the New York Times.
[03:55:49.392 --> 03:55:59.620]  And then there's another article here by David A. Graham, Know Your Conspiracies, a guide to today's trendiest, hippest, and least likely fringe beliefs.
[03:56:01.345 --> 03:56:06.551]  Number one, Barack Obama was not born in the U.S.
[03:56:06.551 --> 03:56:09.934]  Well, there's a lot of evidence he wasn't, and they're sure covering it up.
[03:56:09.934 --> 03:56:12.057]  But what about number two?
[03:56:12.057 --> 03:56:14.099]  Man-made global warming is a hoax.
[03:56:14.099 --> 03:56:15.701]  Anthropogenic global warming is a hoax.
[03:56:15.701 --> 03:56:21.247]  And they just go in to say, we're complete kooks, this is an unlikely, crazy conspiracy theory.
[03:56:21.247 --> 03:56:22.208]  No one believes this!
[03:56:23.576 --> 03:56:32.319]  Only the biggest kooks, when we have the UN's own internal documents and emails, and even now the UN has had to come out and say, okay, we've been cooling since 95.
[03:56:32.319 --> 03:56:36.601]  I mean, that is mainstream news today.
[03:56:36.601 --> 03:56:38.682]  In fact, I'm digging around in my stack.
[03:56:38.682 --> 03:56:45.925]  I showed it, I showed it towards the start of the show.
[03:56:45.925 --> 03:56:48.806]  But no, it just doesn't exist.
[03:56:48.806 --> 03:56:51.187]  Goldman Sachs intentionally created the economic crisis.
[03:56:52.571 --> 03:57:10.560]  Goldman Sachs, McClatchy Newspapers had a five-part series showing how they engineered it to destroy their competition and were betting against the housing and they were telling the public to get involved and they're the ones in all the regulatory positions giving themselves the bank or bailout money.
[03:57:10.560 --> 03:57:12.901]  Democrats' health plan will create death panels.
[03:57:12.901 --> 03:57:16.763]  It does have the government designed on rationing and telling doctors what they can do.
[03:57:16.763 --> 03:57:20.365]  I mean, the book written by Tom Daschle that the bill was based on says that.
[03:57:21.428 --> 03:57:23.169]  Barack Obama is a secret Muslim.
[03:57:23.169 --> 03:57:25.830]  Well, he was trained and raised in a Muslim school.
[03:57:25.830 --> 03:57:31.232]  You can't blame people when he is Barry Sotero and all these other names.
[03:57:31.232 --> 03:57:36.454]  Sarah Palin is not the mother of her one-year-old son, Trig.
[03:57:36.454 --> 03:57:39.476]  They just mix in some stupid stuff to make it bipartisan.
[03:57:39.476 --> 03:57:42.237]  Acorn is part of a liberal conspiracy to steal elections.
[03:57:42.237 --> 03:57:45.158]  They admittedly it's to buy people off.
[03:57:45.158 --> 03:57:46.899]  FEMA is establishing detention camps.
[03:57:49.468 --> 03:57:51.609]  And they go on to say Glenn Beck puts this out.
[03:57:51.609 --> 03:57:53.650]  No, he doesn't.
[03:57:53.650 --> 03:57:58.492]  Council on American-Islamic Relations is trying to infiltrate Capitol Hill and spread jihad.
[03:57:58.492 --> 03:58:01.973]  Obama wants to conscript Americans into a civilian defense corps.
[03:58:01.973 --> 03:58:03.374]  I mean, he openly said that.
[03:58:03.374 --> 03:58:04.694]  Rahm Emanuel's on record.
[03:58:04.694 --> 03:58:09.316]  It's all in my film, Obama Deception, saying you'll be forced to do this in youth corps.
[03:58:09.316 --> 03:58:11.457]  That's in the new cybersecurity bill.
[03:58:11.457 --> 03:58:13.197]  I mean, here it is right here.
[03:58:13.197 --> 03:58:14.398]  The subsection's listed.
[03:58:15.526 --> 03:58:17.087]  With the Youth Corps.
[03:58:17.087 --> 03:58:22.711]  Then it says, number 11, Time Magazine wants to restrict the internet to licensed users.
[03:58:22.711 --> 03:58:26.594]  They did write an article calling for that, and they linked to Alex Jones' two websites.
[03:58:26.594 --> 03:58:28.335]  It says, well, there's a kernel of truth.
[03:58:28.335 --> 03:58:32.798]  We did write a story about Microsoft executive that wants it, yeah, at the UN.
[03:58:32.798 --> 03:58:36.180]  Then they, 9-11 was an inside job.
[03:58:36.180 --> 03:58:37.201]  Look, we're out of time.
[03:58:37.201 --> 03:58:39.362]  Retransmission, jam-packed, starts now.
[03:58:39.362 --> 03:58:40.843]  I'm gonna go over this slowly tomorrow.
[03:58:40.843 --> 03:58:42.464]  A lot of big guests coming up this week.
[03:58:42.464 --> 03:58:44.686]  Please spread the word about the show and the free iPhone app.

[03:58:53.234 --> 03:58:54.714]  It's free!
[03:58:54.714 --> 03:59:01.696]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:59:01.696 --> 03:59:03.777]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[03:59:03.777 --> 03:59:06.018]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:59:06.018 --> 03:59:07.678]  And it's available right now to you.
