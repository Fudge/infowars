[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:33.060]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.060 --> 00:43.580]  thank you for joining us it is Monday the 15th day of February 2010 we're gonna be
[00:43.580 --> 00:54.180]  live here for the next four hours I feel like I have a giant weight on me they
[00:54.180 --> 01:03.460]  say with great knowledge comes sorrow I have a much greater understanding in the
[01:03.460 --> 01:07.860]  average person that isn't saying much for how the world actually operates and
[01:07.860 --> 01:16.740]  works because I've decided to study it and to apply myself and I understand the
[01:16.740 --> 01:22.420]  tricks of the establishment I understand their systems of control how they
[01:22.420 --> 01:27.100]  confuse and confound the population how they dumb down and rob the
[01:27.100 --> 01:37.340]  population how they turn every aspect of man's sinful nature against him how they
[01:37.340 --> 01:45.860]  magnify it I understand the globalist program their agenda their mindset what
[01:45.860 --> 01:53.060]  makes them tick the type of world they are building I understand how they
[01:53.060 --> 01:56.460]  control the major political parties of every nation on the planet except for a
[01:56.460 --> 02:03.860]  handful and because the nature of evil and government a few countries that
[02:03.860 --> 02:11.300]  oppose the new world order or evil themselves that is their leadership and
[02:11.300 --> 02:21.300]  I know that mankind is going into a very very dark time
[02:28.220 --> 02:38.340]  and I desperately just want to at least slow it down a lot of people are
[02:38.340 --> 02:44.380]  waking up a lot of people are becoming conscious the problem is the system
[02:44.380 --> 02:48.340]  didn't get where it is the power elite didn't get where they are by being
[02:48.340 --> 02:53.620]  stupid and they know how to take over movements they know the best way to
[02:53.620 --> 03:04.380]  control opposition is to lead it that's what Barack Obama was and is he was the
[03:04.380 --> 03:08.580]  opposition to Bush bought and paid for by Goldman Sachs saying people that
[03:08.580 --> 03:14.260]  finance Bush the private fellow reserve bankers and now a year into his
[03:14.260 --> 03:19.060]  administration the public's wise to him the good news is people are getting
[03:19.060 --> 03:24.140]  wise faster and faster and so now they've got Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck
[03:24.140 --> 03:30.420]  leading the opposition or trying to and we know who they are and what they are
[03:30.420 --> 03:37.140]  at least a lot of us do a lot of people don't and so it's my job to expose
[03:37.140 --> 03:46.140]  their foils their minions their fronts their loyal opposition let me be clear
[03:46.140 --> 03:52.420]  about something I don't like this job oh I enjoy the triumph of fighting
[03:52.420 --> 03:56.780]  tyranny and our successes but actually being here every day having the
[03:56.780 --> 04:03.700]  responsibility the forced obsession to constantly focus on this to constantly
[04:03.700 --> 04:12.540]  research to constantly gain greater knowledge it is quite a way to bear I
[04:12.540 --> 04:29.980]  am blasted I know I'm right I know how to fix the system I know how to bring
[04:29.980 --> 04:42.340]  the globalist to justice and I'll tell you it's lonely because in the scheme of

[08:04.260 --> 08:10.580]  behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN
[08:10.580 --> 08:13.420]  radio network
[08:13.420 --> 08:29.340]  I love the truth all I've ever tried to do is be honest to be steadfast to have
[08:29.340 --> 08:38.020]  courage and to be committed in the fight against tyranny that's all I've ever
[08:38.020 --> 08:51.260]  tried to do and I know that a lot of people hear the truths that we discuss
[08:51.260 --> 08:59.580]  here on this radio broadcast every day and that they're frightening the
[08:59.580 --> 09:05.780]  problem is you can't choose your own reality the advertising moguls and
[09:05.780 --> 09:12.620]  gurus will tell you that perception is reality but perception is not reality
[09:12.620 --> 09:18.940]  I've used the analogy many times of someone on pcp standing on top of 40
[09:18.940 --> 09:24.540]  story balcony and believing they're a bird and can fly it's happened many
[09:24.540 --> 09:29.620]  times people on hallucinogens think they can fly and they jump off the top of
[09:29.620 --> 09:33.740]  the building and they think they're flying for maybe 10 seconds until they
[09:33.740 --> 09:41.340]  hit the concrete below and splatter all over the ground you see if you have a
[09:41.340 --> 09:49.980]  distorted sense of reality then your perception of reality is not reality
[09:53.380 --> 10:02.300]  it's very simple I know we have an illegitimate criminal government I know
[10:02.300 --> 10:08.900]  that they have declassified anyone can look this up more than 200 cases of
[10:08.900 --> 10:18.620]  staged terror attacks it is on record it is admitted that we have a group of
[10:18.620 --> 10:22.900]  criminals running our society that has staged more than 200 terror attacks that
[10:22.900 --> 10:28.220]  are declassified and if you look at any other major nation and their history
[10:28.220 --> 10:35.620]  they will have countless admitted cases of the government staging crises it's
[10:35.620 --> 10:40.140]  even been declassified more than a decade ago I had read it in books and
[10:40.140 --> 10:44.260]  declassified congressional reports I couldn't believe it four years ago in a
[10:44.260 --> 10:54.420]  Dallas hotel room watching a frontline about Nixon where he planned to bomb his
[10:54.420 --> 11:00.340]  own Republican National Convention and the Democratic National Convention to
[11:00.340 --> 11:04.700]  blame it on his political enemies but word got out and they backed off they
[11:04.700 --> 11:08.100]  couldn't find enough people that were that criminal in the government at the
[11:08.100 --> 11:14.620]  time to do it they even go on television admit this I'll never forget oh it
[11:14.620 --> 11:23.100]  must have been six years ago I went out to buy some light bulbs and I sat there
[11:23.100 --> 11:29.340]  for 30 minutes in the parking lot of Home Depot listening to NPR and they were
[11:29.340 --> 11:36.340]  airing a special about Kermit Roosevelt because he had just died and how Kermit
[11:36.340 --> 11:44.140]  Roosevelt wrote a book CIA section chief 1953 over the Middle East where he
[11:44.140 --> 11:48.420]  admitted that they funded radical Muslims to stage terror attacks and
[11:48.420 --> 11:55.140]  blame it on Mohammed Mosa deck now I already knew that that had been
[11:55.140 --> 12:00.060]  partially declassified in the 80s I knew that Kermit Roosevelt had written the
[12:00.060 --> 12:14.500]  book years before what in 1999 but to hear them come right out and admit it
[12:14.500 --> 12:24.220]  was amazing they had audio recordings of him bragging about it they staged
[12:24.220 --> 12:29.340]  terror attacks and then printed out tens of thousands of handbills with
[12:29.340 --> 12:36.420]  Mohammed Mosa decks supposedly taking credit for it the secular leader of
[12:36.420 --> 12:42.740]  Iran who just wanted his country to be out from under the control of Anglo
[12:42.740 --> 12:53.660]  American oil we knew in 1964 the Gulf of Tonkin had been staged to get us into
[12:53.660 --> 12:58.820]  Vietnam because the different officers on the ships came back and told the
[12:58.820 --> 13:06.540]  San Diego newspaper but it was called a conspiracy theory until 2004 when they
[13:06.540 --> 13:13.420]  released more than three thousand three thousand hours of audio conversations
[13:13.420 --> 13:20.460]  between LBJ and Robert McNamara and others and let me tell you it's hard to
[13:20.460 --> 13:33.660]  listen to but I've done it I've listened to scores of hours of it and all I want
[13:33.660 --> 13:43.540]  to do is to warn people so they know the peril they are in it wasn't fun six
[13:43.540 --> 13:50.220]  months before three months before two months before a week before 9-11 eight
[13:50.220 --> 13:55.140]  years ago to go on the radio
[13:55.140 --> 14:04.740]  and to tell listeners that the government was going to stage a terror
[14:04.740 --> 14:09.220]  attack on the World Trade Centers and blame it on their known CIA asset
[14:09.220 --> 14:29.500]  Osama bin Laden but the truth is the truth it isn't fun to swim upstream it'd
[14:29.500 --> 14:33.820]  be more fun to just get in the inner tube and float downstream into the New
[14:33.820 --> 14:46.540]  World Order and go along with it but I have to tell the truth it was my duty
[14:46.540 --> 14:52.500]  day one to come out against Barack Obama and to point out I'm not saying vote
[14:52.500 --> 15:03.420]  for McCain there isn't even an issue McCain isn't the chosen one the whole
[15:03.420 --> 15:09.260]  point was this has been pre vetted and predestined that's why Obama got four
[15:09.260 --> 15:16.060]  times the campaign money from the banks that run this country because he was the
[15:16.060 --> 15:20.700]  chosen one and I told you in the Obama deception and fall the Republic he would
[15:20.700 --> 15:27.380]  be built up and then he would be destroyed and he is now being destroyed
[15:27.380 --> 15:34.220]  and they will build up the next crop of saviors people like Sarah Palin and
[15:34.220 --> 15:40.740]  Rick Perry the word is those two in the next three years are gonna be running on
[15:40.740 --> 15:49.620]  a presidential ticket oh it'd be a lot more fun in my flesh to just play the
[15:49.620 --> 15:55.580]  Republican game the fake libertarian game and to go along with the power
[15:55.580 --> 16:01.140]  structure in a beyond 500 radio stations and to be all over national TV and get
[16:01.140 --> 16:08.780]  wind and dined and in the short term my family would be a lot safer I would be
[16:08.780 --> 16:22.980]  wealthy but it means nothing my family has no future and your family has no
[16:22.980 --> 16:29.580]  future in this new world order but it's so easy for the world to go out and find
[16:29.580 --> 16:36.300]  people of every stripe and every political name to serve them and to play
[16:36.300 --> 16:44.380]  the part of the rebels so the people believe that they're getting the system
[16:44.380 --> 16:56.860]  fixed only to be conned again it is physically it is financially it is
[16:56.860 --> 17:07.220]  politically dangerous to tell the truth and to tell it on a platform this big
[17:07.220 --> 17:16.140]  and we are big and I know that I have passed another great threshold into a
[17:16.140 --> 17:23.420]  whole nother level of danger it gives me a tingle down my spine and in my good
[17:23.420 --> 17:38.500]  old boy guts oh it is dangerous to tell the truth physically emotionally
[17:38.500 --> 17:47.740]  financially but it is far more dangerous to not tell the truth
[17:47.740 --> 17:55.980]  spiritually and that's all that matters and so I commit myself into God's
[17:55.980 --> 18:05.020]  hands I don't pray and tell God what I want I ask God that his will be done
[18:05.020 --> 18:19.820]  sometimes in the dark of the night though I do hit my knees and cry out to
[18:19.820 --> 18:31.420]  God and say I'm committed to this fight but my God the discernment the
[18:31.420 --> 18:40.660]  understanding and the weight it creates to have real vision to understand and
[18:40.660 --> 18:48.100]  to not even begin to be able to explain it to people in all its
[18:48.100 --> 18:59.020]  intricacies in all its subtleties and in all of its import the magnitude of the
[18:59.020 --> 19:06.500]  world controllers the magnitude of who they are and what they serve and what
[19:06.500 --> 19:11.260]  they are building what they are weaving what they are constructing is so
[19:11.260 --> 19:18.100]  horrific I don't blame any of you listening for wanting to run away from
[19:18.100 --> 19:23.580]  the truth but even if you run away from it the evil is still there the truth is
[19:23.580 --> 19:30.980]  still there that's why you have so much anxiety and they try to misplace it on
[19:30.980 --> 19:43.820]  to fake al-qaeda or other bogeymen they create this is going to be a focused

[24:29.820 --> 24:35.100]  diversions and all the different establishment minions they put out there

[25:09.180 --> 25:25.620]  important that I almost shrink I recoil from even covering it because there's
[25:25.620 --> 25:33.100]  so much evidence and so much proof that I feel like I'm not even worthy to be

[26:32.460 --> 26:42.660]  greater by the day so there is a lot of good things that are happening that we
[26:42.660 --> 26:50.420]  need to talk about as well and there's also the broader picture that we need to
[26:50.420 --> 27:02.460]  talk about but coming up at the bottom of the next hour we're going to

[27:26.340 --> 27:32.340]  how they're trying to implement the next phase of their agenda a further
[27:32.340 --> 27:42.140]  bankrupt and deindustrialized west a new war with Iran and an expanding
[27:42.140 --> 27:49.340]  paramilitary global police state of rapid reaction forces to oppress and

[29:11.780 --> 29:17.300]  going to play these cards but I know what cards they hold in their fist in
[29:17.300 --> 29:32.300]  their hand and clearly clearly it is going to be an attempted assassination of
[29:32.300 --> 29:38.380]  Barack H. Obama I am a sure of this is the Sun coming up in the morning and

[30:23.340 --> 30:27.380]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[30:27.380 --> 30:31.180]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to

[40:13.180 --> 40:17.700]  cover-up with 9-11 this is mortally wounded the New World Order that's why
[40:17.700 --> 40:23.020]  an internal White House documents from Bush and Obama and in their corporate
[40:23.020 --> 40:28.500]  talking points they say they've got to somehow reverse what 9-11 truth is done

[42:43.660 --> 42:46.580]  environmentalists were part of a vast conspiracy to destroy the American way
[42:46.580 --> 42:50.340]  of life and control world population through forced sterilization and
[42:50.340 --> 42:55.980]  abortion that's what the UN and Maury strong and all of these people and the
[42:55.980 --> 43:01.460]  head climatologist for NASA they all right they all say Prince Charles Prince
[43:01.460 --> 43:06.900]  Philip Ted Turner Jacques Stowe United Nations biological diversity assessment
[43:06.900 --> 43:11.140]  they all say they want to destroy the industrialized society and make you
[43:11.140 --> 43:15.060]  bankrupt so they can get you under government control and make you
[43:15.060 --> 43:20.500]  dependent they are the ones that say this it's not us saying this yes it's
[43:20.500 --> 43:25.900]  radical yes it's crazy yes it's evil but we're not the crazies for reporting
[43:25.900 --> 43:32.020]  it the truth is the truth if 9-11's an inside job and the evidence shows it's
[43:32.020 --> 43:36.340]  an inside job then we expose it if it shows that man isn't affecting the
[43:36.340 --> 43:40.820]  climate and this is all a giant fraud to take over society and the UN admits it
[43:40.820 --> 43:52.300]  we report it if Monsanto knew that more than half the monkeys they gave aspertame
[43:52.300 --> 43:58.300]  to died and we know aspertame is a chemical weapon that brain damages you
[43:58.300 --> 44:06.780]  and attacks all the organs we report on it if scores of different varieties of
[44:06.780 --> 44:13.740]  GMO corn sterilize and attack the fertility and organs of mice and rats we
[44:13.740 --> 44:22.180]  report it see I don't stick my finger up to the wind here and say well I'm gonna
[44:22.180 --> 44:39.180]  do what I think is popular that's how you destroy your society by making little
[44:39.180 --> 44:48.940]  compromises and pretty soon you've got 50 plus million aborted babies pretty
[44:48.940 --> 44:52.900]  soon you've killed your entire next generation of workforce so you got to
[44:52.900 --> 44:58.420]  bring in 50 million illegal aliens and legals 30 plus million illegal over 20
[44:58.420 --> 45:02.580]  million legals just in the last 20 years
[45:07.020 --> 45:15.500]  you think it's fun have a newsweek attack me and last week's issue I think
[45:15.500 --> 45:20.380]  it's fun to have that type of attention this is not fun this is duty this is a
[45:20.380 --> 45:24.660]  last-ditch effort to throw myself in front of the machinery in the new world
[45:24.660 --> 45:29.020]  order and if more of you pile on the machine I guarantee you we can bring it
[45:29.020 --> 45:37.780]  down and stop it look at every case where we stand up and take action the new
[45:37.780 --> 45:52.500]  world order grinds to a halt in fact Paul Watson wrote a great story about this
[45:52.500 --> 46:03.460]  newsweek article titled go back to sleep there's no new world order will you guys
[46:03.460 --> 46:06.220]  print me go back to sleep there's no new world order
[46:06.220 --> 46:11.340]  jaren just walked in with this newsweek article I I'd seen it on Friday I just
[46:11.340 --> 46:16.860]  hadn't thought to cover it it's important to get into later
[46:16.860 --> 46:33.140]  oh this is a new newsweek article they've they've written they've written
[46:33.140 --> 46:42.860]  to in the last week my gosh this is a second article attacking us and I
[46:42.860 --> 46:47.980]  notice it always ties me to Glenn Beck so that everybody who's awake to the new
[46:47.980 --> 46:51.660]  world order and who reads this article will then go think Glenn Beck is good
[46:51.660 --> 46:57.140]  so he can Judas go at them and slit their throats that's what I mean folks
[46:57.140 --> 47:02.780]  this isn't a scripted show I don't have 20 employees typing everything into a
[47:02.780 --> 47:06.620]  teleprompter I'm supposed to say on the radio and TV I can't even keep track of
[47:06.620 --> 47:17.140]  the magnitude of this anymore I'm here reading this new New York Times article
[47:17.140 --> 47:20.300]  and it's just all deception
[47:20.300 --> 47:36.380]  unbelievable you know I just want to run away to the mountains for like a year
[47:36.380 --> 47:45.460]  and just really have time to slow down time to contemplate time to get right
[47:45.460 --> 48:00.940]  with God it is such a unbelievable thing to be legitimate to be real but to also
[48:00.940 --> 48:06.380]  be fleshly worldly to not be perfect far from it and to know I have this huge
[48:06.380 --> 48:16.020]  responsibility in front of me to realize the magnitude of this in my place in
[48:16.020 --> 48:25.540]  history not that I care about myself in history but I care how I will be used to
[48:25.540 --> 48:32.620]  discredit people how they will distort who I am so that they can hurt those
[48:32.620 --> 48:40.540]  that we've awakened even if I watch my step even if I can somehow find the
[48:40.540 --> 48:46.820]  intellect and the energy to navigate this archipelago of rocks of shoals of
[48:46.820 --> 48:55.740]  dangerous reefs I just wish so many people weren't dumbed down and then so
[48:55.740 --> 49:00.580]  many others simply social climbers that would sell their family their name their
[49:00.580 --> 49:06.660]  country their heritage out people who revel in deceiving people who revel in
[49:06.660 --> 49:22.140]  deception we've woken up hundreds of millions of people conservatively more
[49:22.140 --> 49:26.380]  than 80% of the folks that we talked to or that other people we know talk to say
[49:26.380 --> 49:33.180]  this radio show my films the websites woke them up but I see so many people I
[49:33.180 --> 49:39.820]  initially wake up then get caught in Eddie pools and rat holes and rabbit
[49:39.820 --> 49:48.460]  trails and God knows I've made a lot of mistakes I haven't been perfect and I
[49:48.460 --> 49:55.700]  understand it's a war and I can't get over analytical about myself I just
[49:55.700 --> 50:09.500]  don't understand the magnitude the sheer scale of the evil the lies a society
[50:09.500 --> 50:14.260]  that lies and lies and lies and we all lie to each other our husbands our
[50:14.260 --> 50:26.540]  wives the frantic pace the fast development of technology everything

[55:00.660 --> 55:10.420]  gonna break down the two newsweek hit pieces on myself in one week we're gonna
[55:10.420 --> 55:16.460]  break down the fact that I am a hundred percent clear just like I was a hundred
[55:16.460 --> 55:21.820]  percent clear they were gonna stage an attack on the world trade centers months
[55:21.820 --> 55:24.340]  before it happened I was a hundred percent clear they were gonna launch a
[55:24.340 --> 55:28.540]  flu hysteria in January of last year three months before they launched the
[55:28.540 --> 55:41.060]  operation I am 100% clear in my mind in the still the night when I have all of
[55:41.060 --> 55:49.020]  my intellect that they are gonna stage a false flag on Obama I believe that is
[55:49.020 --> 56:00.300]  the next card and the enemy has tipped their hand so that is coming up as well
[56:00.300 --> 56:07.380]  and yes I'll get into what happened late last week with Deborah Medina on the
[56:07.380 --> 56:13.020]  dark ones radio show proving again at key points when Ron Paul had a chance to
[56:13.020 --> 56:17.220]  win the primary he came out and told his 10 million listeners on radio his 2
[56:17.220 --> 56:25.660]  million on TV at the time now it's 5 million on TV 4 million that Ron Paul
[56:25.660 --> 56:29.820]  was a kook and dangerous and evil and a 9-11 truth or he's now done it to
[56:29.820 --> 56:38.700]  Medina backing Rick Perry who may be from West Texas a son of a cotton farmer but
[56:38.700 --> 56:45.020]  he's pure new world order by his actions you judge a tree by its fruits and we
[56:45.020 --> 56:48.700]  forgotten he's the one that brought us the trans Texas highway the takeover of
[56:48.700 --> 56:54.300]  8,000 miles of roads then last year when we were beating them they said okay
[56:54.300 --> 56:57.100]  don't worry we're not gonna do it now they just stop calling at the trans
[56:57.100 --> 57:01.660]  Texas corridor and all the toll roads are going in I mean just anywhere where
[57:01.660 --> 57:06.900]  there's a close balance between us winning and losing Glenback rushes in
[57:06.900 --> 57:10.660]  and throws his full weight on the side of the new world order every time I mean
[57:10.660 --> 57:20.260]  do you have any discernment some of you out there any discernment I mean at
[57:20.260 --> 57:23.500]  least Michael Savage will admit that Obama will stage terror attacks and
[57:23.500 --> 57:28.060]  then if they push Sarah Palin for 2012 that they're gonna lose and that she's
[57:28.060 --> 57:32.940]  a ringer for Obama I mean anyone with a morons understanding of politics would
[57:32.940 --> 57:39.740]  know that and so you got to give credit where it's due on every point Glenback
[57:39.740 --> 57:53.820]  is a demon I don't want to attack him but my discernment my gut my intellect my
[57:53.820 --> 57:59.700]  research tells me he is at a key juncture point in our resistance movement he
[57:59.700 --> 58:08.980]  is Benedict Arnold he is Judas Ascariot and he will lead us to destruction just
[58:08.980 --> 58:18.140]  as Barack Obama will lead you to destruction when Medina was gaining five
[58:18.140 --> 58:27.180]  points a week he came in and strafed her and it's still not clear whether it's
[58:27.180 --> 58:34.580]  a death blow all right ladies and gentlemen we're gonna be opening the
[58:34.580 --> 58:40.100]  phones up in the next hour and I'm gonna break down the next false flag

[1:08:13.100 --> 1:08:17.500]  I'm gonna break down the two different newsweek hit pieces on my shelf and
[1:08:17.500 --> 1:08:27.900]  others also the attack by Glenn Beck the Republican Party against ever Medina
[1:08:27.900 --> 1:08:36.340]  Obama making plans to use executive power absolutely key that is coming up
[1:08:36.340 --> 1:08:42.380]  and I want to go to your phone calls now and throughout the broadcast today yes
[1:08:42.380 --> 1:08:48.340]  we have a lot of very informative guests coming up throughout the week but
[1:08:48.340 --> 1:08:53.020]  today we have cleared the deck so that we can cover all the news and take your
[1:08:53.020 --> 1:08:59.180]  phone calls let's talk to Matt in Ohio Matt you're on the air Alex thanks for
[1:08:59.180 --> 1:09:04.460]  taking my call thanks for calling it's wanted to you mentioned that you're
[1:09:04.460 --> 1:09:08.660]  gonna bring it up a little bit later on but I wanted to if it's not jumping the
[1:09:08.660 --> 1:09:16.100]  gun get your take on Glenn Beck's interview and then also just mentioned
[1:09:16.100 --> 1:09:21.180]  that I had seen a couple articles indicating that it may be backfiring that
[1:09:21.180 --> 1:09:27.580]  there was a radio show I think in Texas where the host was taking in callers
[1:09:27.580 --> 1:09:33.300]  trying to see if anybody changed their mind about voting for Medina I think
[1:09:33.300 --> 1:09:39.340]  every single caller said that yeah we posted that that's a station Beck is on
[1:09:39.340 --> 1:09:44.100]  in Dallas we posted quite a few different radio links where almost every
[1:09:44.100 --> 1:09:51.620]  caller was calling in disagreeing saying no we're not gonna now support Perry
[1:09:51.620 --> 1:09:57.420]  we've had Perry for nine and a half years longest-serving governor in Texas
[1:09:57.420 --> 1:10:02.340]  history he suddenly is at all these gun ranges of photos and video shooting guns
[1:10:02.340 --> 1:10:08.540]  he suddenly has gotten even more of a Texas drawl but you know the national
[1:10:08.540 --> 1:10:12.340]  media makes fun of us talking about him being a Bilderberg group attendee that
[1:10:12.340 --> 1:10:16.420]  was in the Dallas Morning News in News 8 Austin and it was illegal it was a
[1:10:16.420 --> 1:10:24.460]  violation of the Logan Act and yes that has backfired to a certain extent but
[1:10:24.460 --> 1:10:32.100]  she was gaining around five points a week we'll see what happens but overall
[1:10:32.100 --> 1:10:36.500]  she already had the Patriots supporting her and see what this does is
[1:10:36.500 --> 1:10:41.380]  shatter the illusion that it's a democratic partisan thing to be a 911
[1:10:41.380 --> 1:10:45.660]  truth and sure there are a lot of Democrats who were just bush haters so
[1:10:45.660 --> 1:10:51.580]  they looked at a 911 truth and with the WMD lies and all the rest of it you know
[1:10:51.580 --> 1:10:55.740]  they saw the evidence but now Obama's continuing the wars continuing the
[1:10:55.740 --> 1:11:00.180]  torture and so they've kind of shut down on that issue but it was from the
[1:11:00.180 --> 1:11:04.620]  beginning mainly true libertarians constitutionalist who value the truth
[1:11:04.620 --> 1:11:09.260]  above partisanship who went and looked at the evidence of 911 and clearly it
[1:11:09.260 --> 1:11:13.700]  was an inside job and so you have the Democratic candidate one of the main
[1:11:13.700 --> 1:11:17.900]  Democratic candidates saying looks like an inside job going further than even
[1:11:17.900 --> 1:11:21.940]  Medina you got her saying well people have a right to their opinion and you
[1:11:21.940 --> 1:11:25.420]  know six of the 10 911 Commission members say it's a cover up and there
[1:11:25.420 --> 1:11:31.180]  should be a new investigation so again it shows that it's a nonpartisan issue
[1:11:31.180 --> 1:11:35.340]  that you've got a lot of Medina supporters who are 911 truthers or who
[1:11:35.340 --> 1:11:39.260]  at least don't trust the official government story and you've got the main
[1:11:39.260 --> 1:11:45.940]  Democratic candidate coming out and saying even more and saying that well
[1:11:45.940 --> 1:11:48.980]  we don't know what happened with 911 there are a lot of questions it could be
[1:11:48.980 --> 1:11:55.740]  an inside job continuing to show that this really is the majority view I mean
[1:11:55.740 --> 1:12:00.420]  people have now seen building seven fall they now know about the CIA drills on
[1:12:00.420 --> 1:12:03.740]  the morning of 911 of the same targets being attacked at the same time they
[1:12:03.740 --> 1:12:07.980]  know about the NORAD stand down they know that 15 of the 19 supposed hijackers
[1:12:07.980 --> 1:12:13.500]  came from Saudi Arabia but we attacked Iraq they know that the hijackers were
[1:12:13.500 --> 1:12:19.700]  trained in spy training in Florida and in California that's mainstream news they
[1:12:19.700 --> 1:12:24.860]  know that and so they they don't come out and say we know it's an inside job but
[1:12:24.860 --> 1:12:29.420]  they say well it sure is reasonable to ask questions and now a lot of Americans
[1:12:29.420 --> 1:12:32.700]  know about Mr. Farmer the head counsel for the 911 Commission saying there was a
[1:12:32.700 --> 1:12:36.860]  conspiracy a criminal cover-up of what really happened by the Pentagon and the
[1:12:36.860 --> 1:12:41.420]  Justice Department and they know six of the ten members have come out and said
[1:12:41.420 --> 1:12:46.500]  that Cheney was giving you know basically a stand-down order and so it's
[1:12:46.500 --> 1:12:51.580]  legitimate to talk about stage terror I mean most conservatives know that Bill
[1:12:51.580 --> 1:12:56.900]  Clinton staged Oklahoma City and so it's not a stretch to know that Bush or his
[1:12:56.900 --> 1:13:02.300]  handlers were involved Matt but I appreciate your call and yes I'm going
[1:13:02.300 --> 1:13:07.260]  to talk about that coming up in the next hour let's go to Justin in West Virginia
[1:13:07.260 --> 1:13:15.300]  Justin you're on the air go ahead hey Alex I had two questions one you were
[1:13:15.300 --> 1:13:20.540]  talking about the aspartame natural sweetener I was wondering what what's a
[1:13:20.540 --> 1:13:25.140]  good article you would recommend that I can show my friends about the aspartame
[1:13:25.140 --> 1:13:28.420]  because they don't believe me about it and they just keep drinking all their
[1:13:28.420 --> 1:13:34.900]  diet sodas well and I mean if your friends don't want to research it for
[1:13:34.900 --> 1:13:40.700]  themselves I don't I mean we don't we don't pre-screen your calls so I don't
[1:13:40.700 --> 1:13:46.260]  have an article actually I do have an article on it here in front of me but I
[1:13:46.260 --> 1:13:54.300]  suggest they just search engine the aspartame manufacturing process and if
[1:13:54.300 --> 1:13:57.580]  you tell them tell them hey I'll bet you a hundred dollars yeah I'm not a
[1:13:57.580 --> 1:14:02.060]  betting man but I will bet occasionally just to show somebody up you know to get
[1:14:02.060 --> 1:14:05.100]  them to admit they're wrong because then they may go check it to try to collect
[1:14:05.100 --> 1:14:09.220]  a hundred bucks or if I'm on the air with a talk show host and they say
[1:14:09.220 --> 1:14:13.980]  there's no such thing as Operation Northwoods there's no ABC News articles
[1:14:13.980 --> 1:14:18.420]  saying US government plan to stage terror attacks in US cities as pretext for
[1:14:18.420 --> 1:14:23.980]  war and I'll say ten thousand dollars right now pal put your money where your
[1:14:23.980 --> 1:14:28.540]  mouth is and then ten minutes later a caller calls and he goes wow I googled
[1:14:28.540 --> 1:14:34.900]  it here it is Baltimore Sun AP ABC News wow I didn't know this so I'm really
[1:14:34.900 --> 1:14:39.100]  talking to the audience I'm gonna get them to go look it up and it's kind of
[1:14:39.100 --> 1:14:42.180]  like a football game a lot of adults only watch football because they're betting
[1:14:42.180 --> 1:14:45.380]  on it if they hear there's a bet involved they'll go look but of course the
[1:14:45.380 --> 1:14:49.220]  talk show host generally just some kind of minion and knows it's the truth and
[1:14:49.220 --> 1:14:55.660]  will say no I'm not gonna bet you cook but you tell him out hey did you know
[1:14:55.660 --> 1:15:01.260]  aspartame is a genetically engineered E coli that's a feces eating bacteria did
[1:15:01.260 --> 1:15:05.700]  you know that this dirty bacteria has been genetically engineered to eat toxic
[1:15:05.700 --> 1:15:12.860]  chemicals that they feed it and then they excrete aspartame and they'll say
[1:15:12.860 --> 1:15:18.180]  that's ridiculous that's crazy and then you go okay a hundred dollars and they
[1:15:18.180 --> 1:15:21.420]  will probably bet you and then they're gonna try to get out of the hundred
[1:15:21.420 --> 1:15:24.180]  dollars but at least you've woken them up you know the goal wasn't to get a
[1:15:24.180 --> 1:15:28.700]  hundred dollars and then they will go online and see major universities and
[1:15:28.700 --> 1:15:33.100]  you can even find photographs and videos of it the black sludge and it is
[1:15:33.100 --> 1:15:40.420]  bacteria feces okay now what makes you get sick with most forms of food
[1:15:40.420 --> 1:15:45.540]  poisoning when they have there's many different varieties of bacteria it isn't
[1:15:45.540 --> 1:15:49.820]  the bacteria generally that there's a few infections that do this that make you
[1:15:49.820 --> 1:15:59.900]  sick okay it is their excretia it's the toxins it's it's it's what they pass
[1:15:59.900 --> 1:16:07.220]  okay that's what with most the most common forms of food poisoning that's
[1:16:07.220 --> 1:16:11.580]  what's really making you sick not the bacteria it's what they've excreted and
[1:16:11.580 --> 1:16:16.420]  then say so wait a minute the same bacterias excretia that gives you food
[1:16:16.420 --> 1:16:23.060]  poisoning a similar type of bacteria excretion is what tastes sweet and is
[1:16:23.060 --> 1:16:32.940]  62 times sweeter per gram than pure cane sugar for example now say use toxic
[1:16:32.940 --> 1:16:40.460]  bacteria feces good and then take them to the store to save on somebody's life
[1:16:40.460 --> 1:16:47.180]  potentially is worth it and say find me a gum here I mean you folks I go to
[1:16:47.180 --> 1:16:54.620]  Walgreens I go to H.E.B. I go to the candy aisle and you literally cannot find
[1:16:54.620 --> 1:16:59.260]  gum Paul Watson choose gum he had to order it especially online in England
[1:16:59.260 --> 1:17:06.060]  this only happened three years ago you cannot find gum even when it's not
[1:17:06.060 --> 1:17:10.300]  sugarless regular sugar gum and it will say sugar corn syrup and then it will
[1:17:10.300 --> 1:17:19.540]  say under it aspartame or the new name that I'm seeing everywhere aminosweet
[1:17:19.540 --> 1:17:27.220]  aminosweet they know everything Monsanto does in all the major studies hurts
[1:17:27.220 --> 1:17:32.060]  life forms hurts mammals this is done by design there's no other way everything
[1:17:32.060 --> 1:17:37.380]  they put out is bad it doesn't matter if it's Agent Orange or these different
[1:17:37.380 --> 1:17:41.220]  varieties of corn that have the pesticide that grows in it so the bugs can't
[1:17:41.220 --> 1:17:44.660]  eat it I mean come on folks it's a no-brainer it kills bugs but you're
[1:17:44.660 --> 1:17:49.380]  supposed to eat it and then all their own studies show it attacks the organs of
[1:17:49.380 --> 1:17:53.180]  the rats and guinea pigs they give it to so there's a great natural news story
[1:17:53.180 --> 1:17:58.860]  out today we've got it up on info wars dot com prison planet dot com aspartame
[1:17:58.860 --> 1:18:06.140]  has been renamed and is now being marketed as a natural sweetener and then
[1:18:06.140 --> 1:18:13.660]  this article has a big list at the bottom of science sites and research
[1:18:13.660 --> 1:18:19.140]  sites that show all the actual research on it but I mean it it's an absolute
[1:18:19.140 --> 1:18:27.540]  fact so that's how you reach out to your friends and then go one further say
[1:18:27.540 --> 1:18:30.740]  well could all these doctors and scientists and researchers and their
[1:18:30.740 --> 1:18:35.020]  own when when Rumsfeld was the head of Searle that was a division of Monsanto
[1:18:35.020 --> 1:18:39.860]  in the in the 70s and then in 1981 when they got it approved if we're just up
[1:18:39.860 --> 1:18:43.900]  here lying this attacks your brain and your body why don't they sue us well
[1:18:43.900 --> 1:18:50.140]  that they can't serve this is admitted so explain that to him does that answer
[1:18:50.140 --> 1:18:56.540]  your question yeah and real quickly I was just confused about the the Obama
[1:18:56.540 --> 1:19:01.140]  deficit it said something about it was going up to 14 but I thought it was
[1:19:01.140 --> 1:19:07.420]  23.7 trillion I'm kind of confused about that okay that is separate well I mean
[1:19:07.420 --> 1:19:12.220]  have you seen us play the MSNBC where they show the number 23.7 yeah I have
[1:19:12.220 --> 1:19:18.780]  that saved well you can go get it from Bloomberg as well the 700 billion is a
[1:19:18.780 --> 1:19:24.140]  revolving open window and that's in congressional testimony that's in the
[1:19:24.140 --> 1:19:29.100]  fall of the Republic but that's itself is separate that's only about two and a
[1:19:29.100 --> 1:19:32.100]  half billion they've gotten from that open window there they have the other
[1:19:32.100 --> 1:19:36.660]  fellow reserve open window where the banks just get whatever they want from
[1:19:36.660 --> 1:19:40.060]  themselves the fellow reserve is their holding company and then it just gives
[1:19:40.060 --> 1:19:45.700]  them whatever they want and when I say 28 trillion that's a two three month old
[1:19:45.700 --> 1:19:50.180]  number it was 23.7 trillion six months ago was over 28 trillion a couple months
[1:19:50.180 --> 1:19:55.140]  ago it's well over 30 trillion now and then that's currently what they've
[1:19:55.140 --> 1:19:58.620]  taken then you've got to pay interest on that you pay the bank's interest on
[1:19:58.620 --> 1:20:03.940]  money we give them. We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are

[1:24:48.500 --> 1:24:58.500]  you don't care for it of the fact that the establishment is clearly preparing
[1:24:58.500 --> 1:25:03.260]  and threatening Obama with a some type of assassination attempt if he doesn't
[1:25:03.260 --> 1:25:10.580]  play ball but Obama knows it will further destroy his political fortunes but
[1:25:10.580 --> 1:25:16.620]  he's being told do it or it's over that is coming up in the next segment Bob and
[1:25:16.620 --> 1:25:22.220]  Pia you're on the air good day to you Alex how you doing all right give you a
[1:25:22.220 --> 1:25:27.340]  call a couple things I just wanted to run by you know I know a lot of people
[1:25:27.340 --> 1:25:31.460]  calling to try to give you a lot of advice and all that I I really not don't
[1:25:31.460 --> 1:25:36.420]  want to do that I just was after watching a lot of your films and all the
[1:25:36.420 --> 1:25:41.620]  information I'm certainly learning a lot being able to pass that on it's just so
[1:25:41.620 --> 1:25:47.620]  surprising to the people that just after they see it they still kind of like some
[1:25:47.620 --> 1:25:53.500]  a few people like in denial of the whole thing and so I was thinking you know
[1:25:53.500 --> 1:25:57.540]  the saying the way to a man's heart is through his stomach all the stuff you
[1:25:57.540 --> 1:26:01.900]  have out I'd love to see something like if you could do something just totally
[1:26:01.900 --> 1:26:07.220]  on like the food and the water because I think people would really really that
[1:26:07.220 --> 1:26:10.620]  would just get their attention so much more because they you know well your
[1:26:10.620 --> 1:26:16.620]  wish your wish is my command that's actually more than half the next film
[1:26:16.620 --> 1:26:22.900]  the one we're working on right now is about that yeah I figured you would
[1:26:22.900 --> 1:26:27.500]  probably already added but just wanted to mention that because I I just think the
[1:26:27.500 --> 1:26:31.540]  information that you put out and all the stuff is just so valuable and people
[1:26:31.540 --> 1:26:36.420]  need to you know we're just full of so much entertainment I think if there was
[1:26:36.420 --> 1:26:40.220]  no television or there was some kind of blackout people which is it's a whole
[1:26:40.220 --> 1:26:44.660]  different lifestyle and there's just so much entertainment out there and people
[1:26:44.660 --> 1:26:49.580]  are just so dumbed down from everything else around them like you said and how
[1:26:49.580 --> 1:26:54.140]  they play into that but anyway a couple other things real quick um I don't know
[1:26:54.140 --> 1:26:59.500]  if you heard about this but last week Rick Perry showed up on some Christian
[1:26:59.500 --> 1:27:03.100]  network station and he's sitting there with these Christian guys passing a
[1:27:03.100 --> 1:27:07.540]  self-off as like this great Christian guy as all I could think of was you and
[1:27:07.540 --> 1:27:11.580]  the stuff I saw about him I was like man I know people are just sitting there
[1:27:11.580 --> 1:27:16.300]  buying right into it you know I was like I was wondering if you saw that or
[1:27:16.300 --> 1:27:21.460]  heard about that yeah Rick Perry is a total chameleon he has little outfits
[1:27:21.460 --> 1:27:25.460]  different little outfits he wears he plays the part of the rancher and the
[1:27:25.460 --> 1:27:28.940]  part of the gun owner and the part of the Christian and the guy fighting the
[1:27:28.940 --> 1:27:32.940]  NAFTA highways he's gonna stop him when he's the one that always vetoes it to
[1:27:32.940 --> 1:27:38.540]  let it through I mean he is just a come he passed all these new taxes he's just
[1:27:38.540 --> 1:27:43.940]  a complete monster and but people like to feel good and hear a text accent and
[1:27:43.940 --> 1:27:50.420]  I'm gonna stop that Medina I'm from a Glenn Beck says I need to be for Rick
[1:27:50.420 --> 1:27:54.660]  Perry and that's why they're slaves that's why they're gonna lose everything
[1:27:54.660 --> 1:27:59.460]  they've got I appreciate your call Bob let's jam in one more Leif in Montana
[1:27:59.460 --> 1:28:04.900]  you're on the air hi how you doing good hey I read an article the other day in
[1:28:04.900 --> 1:28:07.820]  the billings because that I thought I'd touch on it it's about the health care
[1:28:07.820 --> 1:28:13.420]  yes none of the money is going to cure or cause it's all to medicaid the
[1:28:13.420 --> 1:28:17.420]  symptoms yes they're shifting that when I say they're gonna give you an aspirin
[1:28:17.420 --> 1:28:20.940]  for a heart attack that's like Cuba oh everybody gets free health care but you
[1:28:20.940 --> 1:28:26.060]  literally get horrible health care and that's in the bill it cuts Medicare and
[1:28:26.060 --> 1:28:30.980]  Medicaid and raises all these new taxes and the government sets the policies for
[1:28:30.980 --> 1:28:35.380]  doctors of what type of care they can give it's a gift to the HMOs liability
[1:28:35.380 --> 1:28:40.820]  protection cost-cutting it's just a complete fraud since what this lady had
[1:28:40.820 --> 1:28:45.340]  to say was with no prevention it will bankrupt us not only financially but in
[1:28:45.340 --> 1:28:49.380]  the workforce also as we treat the symptoms and let the people die the new
[1:28:49.380 --> 1:28:53.740]  people because we don't have anything in our food anymore we'll have the same
[1:28:53.740 --> 1:28:58.980]  problems and our workforce will almost be nil you know what she said was
[1:28:58.980 --> 1:29:06.580]  diseases come from deficiency in our food and that deficiency isn't drugs well
[1:29:06.580 --> 1:29:09.940]  from all the scientific evidence I've seen and a lot of again top scientific
[1:29:09.940 --> 1:29:14.460]  facilities have known for 50 years that much of our soil is depleted of key
[1:29:14.460 --> 1:29:18.260]  trace elements and minerals and the number one thing you can do for
[1:29:18.260 --> 1:29:23.620]  yourself is really a good liquid mineral supplement and yes a lot of the
[1:29:23.620 --> 1:29:29.620]  things that people develop is linked directly to the fact that a lot of the
[1:29:29.620 --> 1:29:37.060]  minerals have been sucked out of the food I appreciate your call okay folks

[1:35:47.820 --> 1:35:51.660]  of the Wall Street Journal someone who's a real paleo conservative or
[1:35:51.660 --> 1:36:04.460]  constitutionalist just to set the tone of where we are as a society so let's
[1:36:04.460 --> 1:36:07.060]  go ahead and play this clip we'll be back in just a few minutes and I'll
[1:36:07.060 --> 1:36:11.060]  break down the fact that I believe they're getting ready to launch a false
[1:36:11.060 --> 1:36:17.340]  flag staged assassination attempt on Barack Obama stay with us we'll get
[1:36:17.340 --> 1:36:21.300]  ready for the crackdown the US is now officially known as a police state at
[1:36:21.300 --> 1:36:24.900]  least that's according to Paul Craig Roberts he's a columnist and a former
[1:36:24.900 --> 1:36:28.700]  Reagan administration official and he joins me live from Panama City, Florida
[1:36:28.700 --> 1:36:33.260]  Paul thanks so much for joining me so you've said that US President Obama is
[1:36:33.260 --> 1:36:36.780]  continuing Bush era policies and that the United States is essentially a
[1:36:36.780 --> 1:36:42.700]  police state can you elaborate on that please well yes we have this case of
[1:36:42.700 --> 1:36:49.820]  Afia Sidiqui who is an American citizen who was kidnapped and held in the
[1:36:49.820 --> 1:36:57.020]  pilgrim military base in Afghanistan for five years secretly tortured denied
[1:36:57.020 --> 1:37:01.620]  all her constitutional rights the whole thing was totally outside all known
[1:37:01.620 --> 1:37:08.100]  American law and now we've had the Dennis Blair the head of national
[1:37:08.100 --> 1:37:12.020]  intelligence announced that the United States government has a list of
[1:37:12.020 --> 1:37:16.820]  Americans that it will assassinate abroad so the government has announced
[1:37:16.820 --> 1:37:22.220]  gonna kill its own citizens without arrest without trial without conviction of
[1:37:22.220 --> 1:37:26.860]  a capital crime it's just gonna shoot them down somewhere well this these two
[1:37:26.860 --> 1:37:35.900]  things together are the definition of a police state and we have a number of
[1:37:35.900 --> 1:37:41.020]  constitutional scholars in law and our most distinguished law schools who have
[1:37:41.020 --> 1:37:46.620]  said that these proposals and not only are totally illegal under American
[1:37:46.620 --> 1:37:52.540]  law but constitute war crimes under Geneva conventions and what else how else
[1:37:52.540 --> 1:37:56.580]  would you define a police state and so you know I think that's really
[1:37:56.580 --> 1:37:59.820]  interesting mr. Roberts I mean especially because President Obama has
[1:37:59.820 --> 1:38:03.820]  spoken out against so many of these things including torture and you know
[1:38:03.820 --> 1:38:07.900]  he's repeatedly said that he wants to close down Guantanamo Bay so why do you
[1:38:07.900 --> 1:38:11.540]  think nothing has changed and he's continuing these Bush era policies then
[1:38:11.540 --> 1:38:15.780]  that's a very good question there's no difference so far between his
[1:38:15.780 --> 1:38:22.540]  administration and the Bush Cheney regime and so what we see is that there is a
[1:38:22.540 --> 1:38:28.940]  there's been a coup a power grab the the law means nothing to the government it
[1:38:28.940 --> 1:38:36.180]  operates totally outside the law with contempt of the law and what's most
[1:38:36.180 --> 1:38:41.540]  amazing is that Dennis Blair this is not my opinion he went to the United States
[1:38:41.540 --> 1:38:46.060]  Congress and told one of the most important committees the committee on
[1:38:46.060 --> 1:38:50.340]  intelligence that the United States government has a list of Americans that
[1:38:50.340 --> 1:38:59.100]  it will murder well what how does this differ from Joseph Stalin and so I mean
[1:38:59.100 --> 1:39:02.860]  how is this all possible how can the United States just simply disregard
[1:39:02.860 --> 1:39:07.580]  international law and what should be done to stop this I don't know how it's
[1:39:07.580 --> 1:39:14.140]  possible I don't know how Joseph Stalin was able to murder all the heroes of the
[1:39:14.140 --> 1:39:19.820]  Bolshevik Revolution I don't know how Hitler was able to take over Germany and
[1:39:19.820 --> 1:39:26.300]  completely flush the law but that's what's happening here and and we see we
[1:39:26.300 --> 1:39:33.580]  have these statements from these distinguished American legal scholars
[1:39:33.580 --> 1:39:40.060]  that this is not only completely against the Geneva Conventions and the Fifth
[1:39:40.060 --> 1:39:44.380]  Amendment of the United States Constitution which requires a due
[1:39:44.380 --> 1:39:49.180]  process but if you announce you're just going to murder people there's no due
[1:39:49.180 --> 1:39:54.420]  process and so I don't know what's going on I don't understand how this
[1:39:54.420 --> 1:40:00.460]  happens or why the American people are so insucian and inattentive they sit and
[1:40:00.460 --> 1:40:04.220]  take it I don't understand why the Congress when they were told this didn't
[1:40:04.220 --> 1:40:10.060]  order this guy's arrest I mean we have a criminal the head of national intelligence
[1:40:10.060 --> 1:40:13.780]  who comes to the Congress and says we're gonna murder American citizens
[1:40:13.780 --> 1:40:18.620]  nothing happens well mr. Roberts I want to thank you so much you're clearly very
[1:40:18.620 --> 1:40:23.220]  passionate about this according to mr. Roberts the United States turning into a
[1:40:23.220 --> 1:40:37.940]  police state Glenn Beck I have taken a particular interest in this man because
[1:40:37.940 --> 1:40:48.260]  when he showed up on the scene in 2002 on talk radio he was clearly an actor and
[1:40:48.260 --> 1:40:52.780]  then I saw him over the years always posed as a constitutionalist as a
[1:40:52.780 --> 1:40:57.580]  patriot but at every key juncture point when Ron Paul had a chance to win the
[1:40:57.580 --> 1:41:00.780]  Republican primary Glenn Beck came out and said he's dangerous he's bad use the
[1:41:00.780 --> 1:41:06.420]  army against him and his supporters even last year over and over again calling
[1:41:06.420 --> 1:41:13.180]  Ron Paul a kook and I've seen him do countless other things you know he'll
[1:41:13.180 --> 1:41:18.140]  do some good on the health care he'll do some good on acorn he'll do some good on
[1:41:18.140 --> 1:41:25.620]  some key areas but overall he's there as a gatekeeper to be the leader of the
[1:41:25.620 --> 1:41:30.340]  patriot movement and then every time you get somebody real like Debra Medina who
[1:41:30.340 --> 1:41:33.900]  could clearly win the Republican primary and then hands down beat the
[1:41:33.900 --> 1:41:37.580]  Democrats all the pollsters agree with that who will get rid of property tax
[1:41:37.580 --> 1:41:41.900]  who will control the border and would send shockwaves into all the other
[1:41:41.900 --> 1:41:47.100]  states already is having other people run through the tea party movement we
[1:41:47.100 --> 1:41:52.700]  have Republicans being booed at the tea parties Rick Perry Cornyn others a year
[1:41:52.700 --> 1:41:59.020]  and two months ago here in Texas then the Republicans come in and start taking
[1:41:59.020 --> 1:42:03.940]  it over Sean Hannity Glenn Beck Sarah Palin and others you have Palin coming
[1:42:03.940 --> 1:42:07.980]  into Texas endorsing Perry over Debra Medina she would definitely win if
[1:42:07.980 --> 1:42:13.540]  Palin would have endorsed her so to control us they have to pose as us just
[1:42:13.540 --> 1:42:19.540]  cast Sunstein at the Winehouse says because the establishment has no
[1:42:19.540 --> 1:42:24.180]  credibility in the controlled right or the control left so they have to pose as
[1:42:24.180 --> 1:42:33.460]  the revolutionaries to be able to maintain control of the population now on
[1:42:33.460 --> 1:42:38.180]  key issues of 9-11 truth of FEMA camps that they have bills in Congress for that
[1:42:38.180 --> 1:42:43.460]  they admit they built the civilian inmate civilian inmate labor camp program
[1:42:43.460 --> 1:42:55.940]  army dot mill you've got all of this admitted on record and then you have
[1:42:55.940 --> 1:43:01.540]  Glenn Beck on subject after subject building up the hype for a month and I
[1:43:01.540 --> 1:43:04.740]  believe the FEMA cam surreal he said then coming out and discrediting it
[1:43:04.740 --> 1:43:09.340]  exactly as I predicted he would even with the very fake camps that we
[1:43:09.340 --> 1:43:14.580]  exposed over a decade ago I predicted he would use those fake camps and he did
[1:43:14.580 --> 1:43:20.460]  indeed do that a he's either completely copying everything on the show or b I
[1:43:20.460 --> 1:43:27.060]  knew he would go with what had already been debunked and I understood his
[1:43:27.060 --> 1:43:33.740]  mindset to such a level we were able to accurately predict that but bottom line
[1:43:33.740 --> 1:43:38.860]  he's a teleprompter reading puppet now again when Bush is in the Republicans of
[1:43:38.860 --> 1:43:42.780]  the face of the new world order in the establishment and they push for the open
[1:43:42.780 --> 1:43:48.020]  borders and the high taxes and tripling the size of government and new wars and
[1:43:48.020 --> 1:43:56.780]  torture and homeland security and North com and in April of 2008 the Bush
[1:43:56.780 --> 1:44:03.860]  White House has the Justice Department under Mukase put out the Mayak
[1:44:03.860 --> 1:44:07.660]  homeland security report they put out the master report stating the number one
[1:44:07.660 --> 1:44:14.380]  enemy of the government and of North com and homeland security is gun owners
[1:44:14.380 --> 1:44:18.420]  conservatives returning veterans that are gun owners libertarians in the Fed
[1:44:18.420 --> 1:44:27.060]  is Ron Paul Bob bar then we get the information in January we release it and
[1:44:27.060 --> 1:44:33.700]  the media Fox News picks it up and says oh look Obama issued this and and Obama
[1:44:33.700 --> 1:44:41.420]  did reissue it and did expand it but the point is I knew back in 2007 2008 that
[1:44:41.420 --> 1:44:47.220]  Glenn Beck Sean Hannity Neil Boerts all of these guys had gone to the White
[1:44:47.220 --> 1:44:52.060]  House met with Bush over and over again came out and told us he was a man of God
[1:44:52.060 --> 1:44:57.300]  we should trust a man we should love and I knew because I'd had previous
[1:44:57.300 --> 1:45:02.580]  homeland security reports distributed at the state levels we've gotten and
[1:45:02.580 --> 1:45:07.860]  released more than 30 over the years a lot more than that look at my films like
[1:45:07.860 --> 1:45:12.700]  road to tyranny in police day 2000 films made eight years ago a film made ten
[1:45:12.700 --> 1:45:17.140]  years ago in the case of police day 2000 you see everything that's in the
[1:45:17.140 --> 1:45:20.460]  Mayak report and in the homeland security report they got so much attention
[1:45:20.460 --> 1:45:26.060]  finally last year but being issued by Bill Clinton by George Bush by Barack
[1:45:26.060 --> 1:45:31.020]  Obama it doesn't matter it's the same and so when I saw Glenn Beck and Sean
[1:45:31.020 --> 1:45:38.780]  Hannity Limbaugh never really did it he's kind of his own person but still
[1:45:38.780 --> 1:45:41.940]  establishment but I mean these guys are actually getting talking points from the
[1:45:41.940 --> 1:45:47.420]  White House when I heard them giving out exact talking points I said these guys
[1:45:47.420 --> 1:45:54.260]  are obviously enemies these guys are posing as conservatives so they can
[1:45:54.260 --> 1:45:58.500]  control the true constitutionalist movement that's the real threat to the
[1:45:58.500 --> 1:46:08.060]  global takeover and so that's how I knew back in 2006 2007 Beck was bad because
[1:46:08.060 --> 1:46:13.140]  he's always been the worst Sean Hannity a close second saying arrest all
[1:46:13.140 --> 1:46:16.860]  militias make them illegal every child needs a microchip you know stuff like
[1:46:16.860 --> 1:46:21.500]  that and I'm not even paying much attention to these guys I'm too busy and
[1:46:21.500 --> 1:46:27.700]  it just gets worse and worse and worse by the minute and so you look at all the
[1:46:27.700 --> 1:46:32.820]  countless examples of sabotage against real patriots against real libertarians
[1:46:32.820 --> 1:46:36.780]  against real conservatives against people that are truly anti-New World Order
[1:46:36.780 --> 1:46:42.180]  it's as clear as the nose on my face or your face I mean you can see my nose
[1:46:42.180 --> 1:46:48.220]  right now if you're watching present planet on TV it's there it's clear it's
[1:46:48.220 --> 1:46:51.180]  like watching a duck swimming around in a pond and saying is that a duck gee I
[1:46:51.180 --> 1:46:56.580]  don't know and he's shown himself again with his Deborah Medina thing or she
[1:46:56.580 --> 1:46:59.300]  just said that's not a state issue I don't really get into that people have a
[1:46:59.300 --> 1:47:03.820]  right to their opinion oh my god you're a 9-11 truther and within 35 minutes the
[1:47:03.820 --> 1:47:09.940]  robo calls from Rick Perry and K. Bailey Hutchinson and the big neocon blogs
[1:47:09.940 --> 1:47:14.020]  were saying it's over from her because they know if the fake left attacks
[1:47:14.020 --> 1:47:19.180]  Deborah Medina a true states writers a true nullification person over federal
[1:47:19.180 --> 1:47:24.140]  control Tenth Amendment now called 10thers by Newsweek they know a left
[1:47:24.140 --> 1:47:27.260]  attack when only emboldened hers they got to have a phony right-wing attack
[1:47:27.260 --> 1:47:30.980]  which is what Cass Sunstein talks about in the White House memos and in all
[1:47:30.980 --> 1:47:36.420]  these white papers he's written the regulations are he says we've got to
[1:47:36.420 --> 1:47:40.020]  pose as these anti-establishment people to get them in fighting with each other
[1:47:40.020 --> 1:47:46.020]  that's the only way we get credibility and against very complex very sophisticated
[1:47:46.020 --> 1:47:52.060]  I'm just giving you the basics here and I noticed in the last three months all
[1:47:52.060 --> 1:47:56.300]  these editorials there were five of them in the last week and a half a big one in
[1:47:56.300 --> 1:48:02.460]  national review by pipes saying Obama launch a war against Iran or your
[1:48:02.460 --> 1:48:09.420]  candidacy is dead Israel tells him that his chief of staff who's admittedly in
[1:48:09.420 --> 1:48:15.660]  Israeli Israeli army member Rahm Emanuel tells him that now again Obama's a
[1:48:15.660 --> 1:48:19.260]  puppet but he doesn't want to commit political suicide but they're saying you
[1:48:19.260 --> 1:48:23.780]  do this or we're gonna destroy you we're gonna allow an impeachment we're gonna
[1:48:23.780 --> 1:48:29.300]  remove you but if you play ball and Sarah Palin openly said this on Fox News a
[1:48:29.300 --> 1:48:32.620]  week and a half ago you know we played the clip here she said if you play ball
[1:48:32.620 --> 1:48:37.540]  and play the war card and do what you declare war as I think you should you
[1:48:37.540 --> 1:48:43.340]  can pull the clip up we played it here then you're gonna win in 2012 and I'm
[1:48:43.340 --> 1:48:49.220]  basically not gonna run against you and then I heard Glenn Beck start beating
[1:48:49.220 --> 1:48:54.340]  the drum three weeks ago that 9-11 truthers are revolutionaries and they're
[1:48:54.340 --> 1:48:57.260]  figuring out that Obama's gonna continue the torture and the wars and the
[1:48:57.260 --> 1:49:03.420]  secret arrest and so they're going to kill Obama and I don't really even watch
[1:49:03.420 --> 1:49:11.780]  his show I can't stand it up but this morning I watched a clip that's up on
[1:49:11.780 --> 1:49:17.700]  prisonplanet.com and a story titled a message to Glenn Beck what are the
[1:49:17.700 --> 1:49:25.940]  dangers of the 9-11 truthers excellent article by Joe Robertson and it was a
[1:49:25.940 --> 1:49:34.620]  repeat of what Glenn Beck said that I heard on the radio but even worse and
[1:49:34.620 --> 1:49:40.300]  he said I fear for Obama because the left the 9-11 truthers which aren't the
[1:49:40.300 --> 1:49:44.820]  left it's just the American people so again he makes it a left-right paradigm
[1:49:44.820 --> 1:49:48.220]  and he has this left-right paradigm up on the screen of the left and the right
[1:49:48.220 --> 1:49:51.700]  he says he's against the left-right paradigm but every graphic he shows
[1:49:51.700 --> 1:49:57.180]  every chalkboard illustration at a third-grade level for his audience he
[1:49:57.180 --> 1:50:01.820]  shows it and he says oh everybody's on the left over here that thinks 9-11 was
[1:50:01.820 --> 1:50:06.380]  an inside job when that's it's it's not a left-right issue they're scared of
[1:50:06.380 --> 1:50:09.940]  populist finding out about this they're scared of it not being seen as
[1:50:09.940 --> 1:50:21.980]  conservative if you're pro-war they're losing control 9-11 truth is even
[1:50:21.980 --> 1:50:25.660]  bigger than it ever was I mean this morning on 590 a.m. caller after caller
[1:50:25.660 --> 1:50:30.660]  calling in about building seven they weren't even discussing it there's been
[1:50:30.660 --> 1:50:33.700]  a total loss of credibility by government across the board whether it's
[1:50:33.700 --> 1:50:41.260]  Obama or George Bush or Sarah Palin or Rick Perry and so from all the clear
[1:50:41.260 --> 1:50:50.380]  evidence I've seen and Tarpley said this a few months ago I now agree with him
[1:50:50.380 --> 1:50:56.420]  but I've got more to add when we come back after the break I'm gonna really
[1:50:56.420 --> 1:51:01.500]  lay out what their current operation is and what their future plans are hey

[1:56:41.060 --> 1:56:50.100]  the things he's done but studying false flag terror studying how the globalist
[1:56:50.100 --> 1:57:01.860]  operate studying things that they have done in the past studying how they have
[1:57:01.860 --> 1:57:13.700]  operated in the past you get a very clear picture of their psychological
[1:57:13.700 --> 1:57:18.820]  makeup of their modus operandi if they're one thing they're pathological
[1:57:18.820 --> 1:57:24.300]  they do the same thing in different variants over and over again they're
[1:57:24.300 --> 1:57:28.260]  going to have trouble staging another domestic terror attack or another
[1:57:28.260 --> 1:57:32.460]  staged bio attack like the flu they're going to have trouble launching a new
[1:57:32.460 --> 1:57:37.140]  war after they got caught lying about Iraq with the supposed WMD's they've
[1:57:37.140 --> 1:57:45.220]  been caught lying about Iran with supposed WMD's and so how are they
[1:57:45.220 --> 1:57:52.380]  going to launch their criminal agenda what are some of the things from
[1:57:52.380 --> 1:58:00.660]  studying these people that we know they're going to do many people from
[1:58:00.660 --> 1:58:05.340]  the day Barack Obama was elected well really even before marvelled at the
[1:58:05.340 --> 1:58:09.580]  fact that we had our supposed first black president he's actually less than
[1:58:09.580 --> 1:58:14.140]  10 percent African he's mainly Anglo and Arab but we have our first Arab
[1:58:14.140 --> 1:58:20.660]  president whatever and so when we come back I'm going to systematically break
[1:58:20.660 --> 1:58:27.380]  this down and talk about what clearly is the next false flag move for the
[1:58:27.380 --> 1:58:35.460]  globalist for the New World Order so that's coming up after the 70 second
[1:58:35.460 --> 1:58:40.740]  break as we reach the halfway point in transmission

[2:00:40.700 --> 2:00:46.580]  collapsing which we of course predicted years ago that is coming up ladies and
[2:00:46.580 --> 2:00:51.820]  gentlemen all right on the subject of Glenn Beck he's only a player in this
[2:00:51.820 --> 2:00:59.820]  larger theatrical shenanigan I have seen Sarah Palin I have seen pipes I've
[2:00:59.820 --> 2:01:04.300]  seen all these top neocons in editorials and on television in the last few
[2:01:04.300 --> 2:01:10.140]  months you've all seen it as well we played the clips here say attack Iran or
[2:01:10.140 --> 2:01:13.420]  your presidency is over
[2:01:16.460 --> 2:01:23.580]  and we know that again Obama is a puppet but he doesn't want to politically
[2:01:23.580 --> 2:01:28.620]  destroy himself as well so they've got all the dirt and all the Larry Sinclair
[2:01:28.620 --> 2:01:33.060]  stuff they can bring out whether it's true or not to ruin him they've got all
[2:01:33.060 --> 2:01:39.300]  the other reports of drug use they've got the truth or thing that's been
[2:01:39.300 --> 2:01:43.260]  promoted they've got all these ways whether true or not they can bring down
[2:01:43.260 --> 2:01:48.660]  Obama whenever they want he's outlived his usefulness he's one year and a month
[2:01:48.660 --> 2:01:53.740]  into his administration and he is politically crashing and burning with
[2:01:53.740 --> 2:01:57.340]  the lowest approval rating of any president 13 months into their
[2:01:57.340 --> 2:02:03.700]  administration and the line on the graph goes straight down from the heights of
[2:02:03.700 --> 2:02:10.780]  80 plus percent down to 40 percent and dropping fast how do the globalist grab
[2:02:10.780 --> 2:02:16.740]  victory out of the jaws of defeat but we know the remote and I have to have
[2:02:16.740 --> 2:02:19.700]  credit where credit is due of all these hundreds of different points I have that
[2:02:19.700 --> 2:02:24.660]  bring me to this conclusion tarply a few months ago when the gatecrashers who've
[2:02:24.660 --> 2:02:30.940]  now taken the fifth amendment in congressional testimony everything is
[2:02:30.940 --> 2:02:35.340]  about security security how Obama's not safe when he was running for president
[2:02:35.340 --> 2:02:40.740]  in Dallas there was no no security there oh my god there are people down the
[2:02:40.740 --> 2:02:44.620]  street wearing firearms oh we've got to restrict the second amendment what are
[2:02:44.620 --> 2:02:51.900]  we going to do somebody's going to go after Obama and now I see video of
[2:02:51.900 --> 2:02:58.100]  Glenn Beck and other neocons the last month over and over again saying 9 11
[2:02:58.100 --> 2:03:04.020]  truthers and anti wars are going to assassinate Obama in the White House
[2:03:04.020 --> 2:03:09.620]  well wait a minute if Obama's so pro war and so pro police state and North
[2:03:09.620 --> 2:03:14.020]  com why are you guys attacking well you're there to supporting when Glenn
[2:03:14.020 --> 2:03:18.900]  Beck comes out who's discredited with the control left and attacks Obama that
[2:03:18.900 --> 2:03:22.100]  then gives him support remember a year ago we got internal White House memos
[2:03:22.100 --> 2:03:26.500]  where they said we're gonna run against rush limbaugh he's discredited he's a
[2:03:26.500 --> 2:03:34.900]  drug addict he's got all these problems we will play up the fact that
[2:03:34.900 --> 2:03:40.020]  everything is rush limbaugh and try to get the left to now support war support
[2:03:40.020 --> 2:03:43.380]  torture support big government support banker bailouts because the
[2:03:43.380 --> 2:03:47.060]  alternative is rush limbaugh and the republicans well more and more now
[2:03:47.060 --> 2:03:50.580]  because they're not sure if he's going to stay employed or stay sober or he's
[2:03:50.580 --> 2:03:55.580]  got heart problems whatever the case may be that the replacement for limbaugh on
[2:03:55.580 --> 2:04:02.260]  the 2.0 of propaganda of fake conservatism is now Glenn Beck far worse
[2:04:02.260 --> 2:04:08.100]  they tried savage but he isn't globalist enough for him with the msnbc show as
[2:04:08.100 --> 2:04:16.580]  you know five years ago four years ago and so they're stuck between a rock and
[2:04:16.580 --> 2:04:19.660]  a hard place how do they stage new terror attacks when the average person
[2:04:19.660 --> 2:04:24.020]  now understands inside job self-inflicted wound false flag when
[2:04:24.020 --> 2:04:27.900]  that's now in the vernacular people now understand that that people are now on
[2:04:27.900 --> 2:04:32.700]  the lookout for that look at Kurt Haskell and his wife on the plane seeing
[2:04:32.700 --> 2:04:35.460]  the second bomber seeing the sharp-dressed man get him on the plane
[2:04:35.460 --> 2:04:38.900]  saying the government clearly got him on the plane protecting that's now
[2:04:38.900 --> 2:04:43.940]  admitted by the state department in the FBI they let him on the plane without a
[2:04:43.940 --> 2:04:47.580]  passport they protected him they got him on the plane see because we have people
[2:04:47.580 --> 2:04:52.780]  watching now everywhere so I'm going to continue breaking down the evidence when
[2:04:52.780 --> 2:04:56.820]  we come back for the fact that I believe they're gonna pull a false flag
[2:04:56.820 --> 2:05:01.820]  assassination attempt straight ahead stay with us this is Alex Jones and I

[2:08:00.540 --> 2:08:05.940]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[2:08:05.940 --> 2:08:10.500]  because there's a war on for your mind
[2:08:10.500 --> 2:08:19.620]  okay about a month and a half ago we first had the White House gatecrashers
[2:08:19.620 --> 2:08:24.260]  at that party I really I really learned to respect Webster Tarpley's deep
[2:08:24.260 --> 2:08:28.940]  analysis he said that off of that story and a bunch of others the way they were
[2:08:28.940 --> 2:08:34.180]  written they were preparing the public for the idea that Obama isn't safe
[2:08:34.180 --> 2:08:38.460]  inside the White House not from people that sneak into parties and the two or
[2:08:38.460 --> 2:08:41.700]  three security breaches they've had which they've done the statistics on
[2:08:41.700 --> 2:08:46.620]  that's normal it's about on par for how many they normally have but this was
[2:08:46.620 --> 2:08:52.780]  being obsessed on to introduce the idea of an inside coup and that this was a
[2:08:52.780 --> 2:08:58.900]  veiled threat against Obama and I've seen so much of what he talks about come
[2:08:58.900 --> 2:09:02.420]  true that I respected it we're gonna get Tarpley on the next few days to talk
[2:09:02.420 --> 2:09:07.900]  about this but I put it on kind of the back burner thinking about it and then
[2:09:07.900 --> 2:09:13.220]  I started well over the last year seeing all these staged events where they get
[2:09:13.220 --> 2:09:18.140]  meth heads or ex-cons and set them up and claim that they were gonna attack
[2:09:18.140 --> 2:09:21.860]  Obama and they find some drughead white supremacists who said they were gonna
[2:09:21.860 --> 2:09:28.980]  you know wear white tuxedos with white top hats and play ZZ top and go kill him
[2:09:28.980 --> 2:09:33.060]  and just all you know they found a lot of nuts to kind of introduce that idea as
[2:09:33.060 --> 2:09:37.020]  well and that dovetails in with the Mike the Mayak report the Homeland
[2:09:37.020 --> 2:09:41.900]  Security reports and others so I saw that going on and then just knowing how
[2:09:41.900 --> 2:09:46.100]  they operate and what they do and a lot of other ingredients to their modus
[2:09:46.100 --> 2:09:51.900]  operandi I then started seeing the globalists say look your presidency is
[2:09:51.900 --> 2:09:56.660]  over and you're gonna get impeached or not even get reelected if you don't
[2:09:56.660 --> 2:10:01.380]  launch a new war that's the only way to save yourself and we had previous
[2:10:01.380 --> 2:10:05.820]  neocon articles about how great 9-11 was and how he did another 9-11 and that's
[2:10:05.820 --> 2:10:11.020]  what Glenn Beck's all about the 9-12 project the day after 9-11 that feeling
[2:10:11.020 --> 2:10:14.820]  we had of wanting to nuke people of wanting to torture of how we came
[2:10:14.820 --> 2:10:20.140]  together under a big lie of fraud that's what he wants to re-invoke so so
[2:10:20.140 --> 2:10:24.380]  everything is about that and they hate the 9-11 truth movement because they
[2:10:24.380 --> 2:10:29.060]  track and read and have the aggregate systems online with Google and the NSA
[2:10:29.060 --> 2:10:33.980]  they know that 9-11 truth is actually growing I hear it on talk radio I see
[2:10:33.980 --> 2:10:39.260]  it on the web more and more evidence comes out it just grows and grows it's
[2:10:39.260 --> 2:10:43.420]  been depoliticized now that Bush left a lot of conservatives are now looking at
[2:10:43.420 --> 2:10:47.660]  it and learning about false flag what's one of the only false flags they've got
[2:10:47.660 --> 2:10:54.020]  that can make Obama a victim try to and I've seen this going on for a decade
[2:10:54.020 --> 2:10:58.540]  merged the idea of militias and constitutionalist working with Muslim
[2:10:58.540 --> 2:11:03.220]  extremist what's the only way to do that and then somehow tie that into the
[2:11:03.220 --> 2:11:08.260]  radical left and be able to sick homeland security and North com on the
[2:11:08.260 --> 2:11:15.220]  American people what is the only way they're going to be able to do that by
[2:11:15.220 --> 2:11:21.100]  staging a fake assassination attempt on Obama where he survives or where he is
[2:11:21.100 --> 2:11:25.420]  wounded what was it ten years ago it even came out the mainstream news that
[2:11:25.420 --> 2:11:30.580]  the Taiwanese president staged a shooting of himself in a parade and it
[2:11:30.580 --> 2:11:33.700]  turned out they just set off some firecrackers and then they put a little
[2:11:33.700 --> 2:11:39.780]  cut on his side during an election I mean this is what they do different Roman
[2:11:39.780 --> 2:11:43.500]  emperors would stage assassination attempts on themselves as a pretext to
[2:11:43.500 --> 2:11:48.980]  crack down on people the Zars would do this Saddam Hussein did this under US
[2:11:48.980 --> 2:11:59.500]  direction in 1979 when he got power that's how he arrested his political
[2:11:59.500 --> 2:12:04.780]  opposition so we know that's in the playbook of the CIA and other governments
[2:12:04.780 --> 2:12:11.540]  and then I went ahead last night in this morning and searched the term on
[2:12:11.540 --> 2:12:18.420]  YouTube of assassinations planned on Obama and I found Glenn Beck Sean
[2:12:18.420 --> 2:12:25.740]  Hannity and others that's clearly a talking point that they've now got saying
[2:12:25.740 --> 2:12:30.580]  his White House is infiltrated with 911 truthers and they're going to try to
[2:12:30.580 --> 2:12:35.820]  killing and the anti-war movement they're going to try to kill him because
[2:12:35.820 --> 2:12:40.380]  he's expanding the wars while they give him left cover criticizing him for not
[2:12:40.380 --> 2:12:44.500]  starting enough wars so it's a balancing act to re-energize the left
[2:12:44.500 --> 2:12:48.860]  right paradigm at the same time claiming they're not part of the left right
[2:12:48.860 --> 2:12:53.180]  paradigm that they're anti-establishment as if Roger Ailes and Fox News is
[2:12:53.180 --> 2:12:58.220]  anti-establishment and they're dovetailing their propaganda in Newsweek and Time
[2:12:58.220 --> 2:13:02.420]  Magazine with Beck. Beck says I'm a patriot but then criticizes all the real
[2:13:02.420 --> 2:13:07.980]  patriot groups and then Newsweek and Time attack Beck and mix him in with Alex
[2:13:07.980 --> 2:13:12.700]  Jones and Ron Paul because they're discrediting Beck from the left angle so
[2:13:12.700 --> 2:13:16.780]  the left doesn't like me and then Beck attacks myself and others so that the
[2:13:16.780 --> 2:13:22.020]  right wing doesn't like us because we're the real bonafide patriots here who
[2:13:22.020 --> 2:13:26.820]  understand the tools of statecraft and manipulation that are being used against
[2:13:26.820 --> 2:13:31.020]  us so I'm going to play this Glenn Beck clip I'm not going to play the whole eight
[2:13:31.020 --> 2:13:35.820]  minutes it's up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com in the article titled
[2:13:35.820 --> 2:13:43.100]  a meeting a message to Glenn Beck what are the dangers of 911 truthers and Paul
[2:13:43.100 --> 2:13:48.180]  Watson's doing a giant breakdown of this now remember I told you 9-11 was
[2:13:48.180 --> 2:13:50.980]  going to happen six months five months four months three months two months a
[2:13:50.980 --> 2:13:53.860]  month before I said they'll blow up the World Trade Center blaming on their
[2:13:53.860 --> 2:13:58.660]  asset of someone bin Laden how did I know that I saw the preparation in the
[2:13:58.660 --> 2:14:03.180]  media introducing bin Laden telling you he's going to get you ran corporation
[2:14:03.180 --> 2:14:06.100]  saying when the attack comes we're going to take your rights we're going to
[2:14:06.100 --> 2:14:09.140]  federalize for your own good we're going to launch wars we're going to go into
[2:14:09.140 --> 2:14:15.220]  Iraq now you know about the oil meetings one month into office in 2001 in
[2:14:15.220 --> 2:14:18.820]  February with Cheney they were already planning all this and talking about a
[2:14:18.820 --> 2:14:22.620]  big staged event a year before that in the rebuilding America's defenses
[2:14:22.620 --> 2:14:28.540]  September 20th 2000 Cheney wrote about giant Pearl Harbor level events to
[2:14:28.540 --> 2:14:31.500]  launch their new world order and then there's a lot of other evidence goes
[2:14:31.500 --> 2:14:36.420]  into it but but in the balance of time the interest of time just simplifying it
[2:14:36.420 --> 2:14:47.020]  boiling it down rendering it down to its basics this is a perfect false flag to
[2:14:47.020 --> 2:14:51.900]  demonize domestic groups that are against the war torture big government
[2:14:51.900 --> 2:14:57.500]  and a demonized 9-11 truth which the White House own Cass Sunstein says is
[2:14:57.500 --> 2:15:00.980]  the number one enemy what Congress under Bush that was her number one enemy it
[2:15:00.980 --> 2:15:04.940]  gives them the pretext to censor the web to push through their whole agenda and
[2:15:04.940 --> 2:15:10.380]  launch a new war so they're going to have a stage assassination attempt of
[2:15:10.380 --> 2:15:17.740]  Obama in the next year probably sooner they may have multiple staged events
[2:15:17.740 --> 2:15:24.220]  that build up he may even be wounded they may even kill him to then make him a
[2:15:24.220 --> 2:15:29.180]  sacrificial lamb to where who's left in his administration Joe Biden and others
[2:15:29.180 --> 2:15:34.420]  can do whatever they want with wars with domestic crackdowns with the riots
[2:15:34.420 --> 2:15:40.420]  that will start if they blame it on a tea party slash 9-11 truth and I've seen
[2:15:40.420 --> 2:15:44.820]  them following this script getting it ready building it out getting everybody
[2:15:44.820 --> 2:15:48.900]  ready so I'm telling you in their hand they've got the war with Iran they've
[2:15:48.900 --> 2:15:52.420]  got nukes they've got bio weapons he signed the executive orders for that
[2:15:52.420 --> 2:15:57.420]  they've got fake hack attacks on the internet infrastructure as a pretext to
[2:15:57.420 --> 2:16:04.740]  take it over but the biggest card I see them playing in their fist their ace of
[2:16:04.740 --> 2:16:13.660]  spades is to stage an attack on Obama and they are getting ready for this to
[2:16:13.660 --> 2:16:18.340]  demonize the opposition and bring in a massive crackdown and I already was
[2:16:18.340 --> 2:16:22.020]  worried about this but I didn't want to come on air I wasn't 100% sure but
[2:16:22.020 --> 2:16:25.940]  after I've seen what Glenn Beck has had to say and others clearly they are
[2:16:25.940 --> 2:16:29.860]  threatening him they are menacing him they're letting him know we can get to
[2:16:29.860 --> 2:16:33.860]  you and we will blame it on the opposition and Obama's like but this is
[2:16:33.860 --> 2:16:37.540]  political suicide to launch more wars and have another banker take over bail
[2:16:37.540 --> 2:16:43.420]  out and they're saying you will do this and we will save you you attack Iran we
[2:16:43.420 --> 2:16:48.140]  will get you reelected Sarah Palin even said that you know will I run against
[2:16:48.140 --> 2:16:52.940]  him will he lose depends of the attacks I ran like he needs to like I think you
[2:16:52.940 --> 2:17:01.300]  should he needs to declare war he needs to play the war card those are quotes now
[2:17:01.300 --> 2:17:06.620]  you can be caught up in Rush Limbaugh ism or Sean Hannity ism or Barack Obama
[2:17:06.620 --> 2:17:10.580]  ism like I told you foolish Barack Obama supporters you're being played and I'm
[2:17:10.580 --> 2:17:15.900]  telling Glenn Beck Republican Party Tea Party nation people being played you
[2:17:15.900 --> 2:17:19.100]  need to wake up and realize that you're the target of Homeland Security you're
[2:17:19.100 --> 2:17:23.660]  the target of North com you are the target of all of this when Bush was in
[2:17:23.660 --> 2:17:28.620]  office when Clinton was in office and now that Obama's in office so the false
[2:17:28.620 --> 2:17:33.740]  flag is kill Obama or wound him or try to kill him but they need to probably at
[2:17:33.740 --> 2:17:37.740]  least wound him to get people rioting to get everybody at each other's throats
[2:17:37.740 --> 2:17:42.820]  and then they're gonna blame it on Islamists this tied in with a tea party
[2:17:42.820 --> 2:17:49.700]  9-11 truther now that doesn't exist but I've seen them beginning this history
[2:17:49.700 --> 2:17:55.180]  this this false history this ledger this cutout I've seen them with their fake
[2:17:55.180 --> 2:17:58.580]  Al Qaeda spokesman that they upload with the Intel Center and the same Al Qaeda
[2:17:58.580 --> 2:18:03.140]  logo is the Intel Center logo saying Al Qaeda and there's the grandson of the
[2:18:03.140 --> 2:18:10.020]  former head of the ADL Adam Goodon we work with your militias we're going to
[2:18:10.020 --> 2:18:13.820]  release anthrax we're going to attack you we're going to go after your president
[2:18:13.820 --> 2:18:19.300]  we're going to do this see Al Qaeda is a cutout they attached to whoever they
[2:18:19.300 --> 2:18:26.700]  want to attack Iran Iraq the American people
[2:18:26.700 --> 2:18:38.620]  Yemen it is a wholly created government creation to do this we're gonna go break
[2:18:38.620 --> 2:18:43.460]  and I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna start playing this clip and he covers
[2:18:43.460 --> 2:18:47.140]  so much I mean this is definitely written by army psyops this is
[2:18:47.140 --> 2:18:51.180]  definitely psychological warfare this isn't somebody just reading talking
[2:18:51.180 --> 2:18:55.060]  points off a teleprompter there are so many different forms of psychological
[2:18:55.060 --> 2:18:58.940]  warfare wound into this one clip that's why I can't watch it it makes my brain
[2:18:58.940 --> 2:19:03.260]  burn with understanding and realization and just every word he says
[2:19:03.260 --> 2:19:08.460]  everything he twists his mannerisms the way he does it the way he talks to you
[2:19:08.460 --> 2:19:15.180]  like you're a child the left-right imagery the way they use chalkboards the
[2:19:15.180 --> 2:19:20.260]  way he has the little stickers that he puts up and then hesitates to post it's
[2:19:20.260 --> 2:19:26.100]  all done at a child-like level the way he implies that communist in the
[2:19:26.100 --> 2:19:33.100]  government are the ones undermining the economy to destroy it by design when the
[2:19:33.100 --> 2:19:38.500]  communists work for the big banks to take over nations and when the White
[2:19:38.500 --> 2:19:43.580]  House has Sunstein says arrest anybody this 9-11 truth and when it was Glenn
[2:19:43.580 --> 2:19:46.980]  Beck and George Bush and others that helped ram through the banker bailout
[2:19:46.980 --> 2:19:52.420]  he now says it's communists that want to kill Obama in the White House if he
[2:19:52.420 --> 2:19:56.460]  doesn't destroy the economy when it's a bipartisan group of offshore banks
[2:19:56.460 --> 2:20:04.020]  destroying the economy I mean it's just a tissue of fraud get $1,000 in free

[2:24:05.180 --> 2:24:11.260]  good news here is that even senator Jay Rockefeller is saying I think Obama's
[2:24:11.260 --> 2:24:15.860]  unbelievable to me they're getting so desperate that even the leadership of
[2:24:15.860 --> 2:24:21.140]  the New World Order are throwing him under the bus you could see what they're
[2:24:21.140 --> 2:24:27.340]  doing right now because the entire system is losing all credibility so they've
[2:24:27.340 --> 2:24:32.340]  got the controlled left trying to reign in and control their people that don't
[2:24:32.340 --> 2:24:35.740]  like what's happening they've got the controlled right in there trying to do
[2:24:35.740 --> 2:24:42.340]  the same thing but all the king's horses all the king's men can't put the New
[2:24:42.340 --> 2:24:46.660]  World Order back together again that's why Obama has announced I will just use
[2:24:46.660 --> 2:24:52.700]  executive fiat power and do whatever I want and it appears that he is going to
[2:24:52.700 --> 2:24:57.020]  do what they want and go into Iran attack Iran it appears that they don't
[2:24:57.020 --> 2:25:02.860]  even care they are still setting him up for an assassination attempt to empower
[2:25:02.860 --> 2:25:08.340]  him to empower his memory whether they kill him God forbid or whether they just
[2:25:08.340 --> 2:25:12.380]  wound him or whether it's a close assassination attempt they are going to
[2:25:12.380 --> 2:25:19.460]  blame it on the American people prepare yourselves get ready for this to happen
[2:25:19.460 --> 2:25:23.940]  because Glenn back every other day now is saying I just fear for him you watch
[2:25:23.940 --> 2:25:27.380]  they're going to attack him they're going to try to kill him look there's no
[2:25:27.380 --> 2:25:31.860]  security in the White House the gatecrashers anybody can get in they're
[2:25:31.860 --> 2:25:35.900]  going to get him the people that are anti-war and 911 truth they're going to
[2:25:35.900 --> 2:25:40.780]  get him they're going to get him they're now introducing it let's start now with
[2:25:40.780 --> 2:25:45.060]  the Glenn back clip here it is Mary regime is when it is on the verge of
[2:25:45.060 --> 2:25:49.900]  collapse a regime a regime with revolutionaries in it it is trouble the
[2:25:49.900 --> 2:25:55.900]  Democratic party is again his entire regime is anti-free speech anti 911
[2:25:55.900 --> 2:26:00.420]  truth there's no doubt they put Van Jones in to destroy him publicly and tie a
[2:26:00.420 --> 2:26:05.380]  communist to 911 truth but it's true the globalist regime is in deep trouble so
[2:26:05.380 --> 2:26:10.140]  he tells a lot of truth but then spins it around that the regime are a few of
[2:26:10.140 --> 2:26:13.220]  the communists in his administration when the big banks always use communists
[2:26:13.220 --> 2:26:16.500]  to consolidate wealth girl quickly at Georgetown Bill Clinton's mentor broke
[2:26:16.500 --> 2:26:21.780]  that down continue it's collapsing it's either gonna have to renew itself or it's
[2:26:21.780 --> 2:26:26.980]  gonna collapse again they renewed themselves when people got wise to
[2:26:26.980 --> 2:26:30.220]  bush through Obama now they renew themselves with Glenn Beck and Sarah
[2:26:30.220 --> 2:26:35.700]  Palin then they renewed themselves again with more stage terror attacks
[2:26:35.700 --> 2:26:42.340]  continue full of revolutionaries let me show you why the president is in danger
[2:26:42.340 --> 2:26:48.580]  there are two kinds of radicals again he builds it up slowly and he gives you
[2:26:48.580 --> 2:26:55.100]  very simplistic childlike graphics of this tree okay he doesn't show you the
[2:26:55.100 --> 2:26:58.820]  trees a bunch of banks that openly run the left and right and are playing us
[2:26:58.820 --> 2:27:02.380]  off against each other and consolidating power no it's the different types of
[2:27:02.380 --> 2:27:06.900]  revolutionaries but the globalist fund all the revolutionaries you're about to
[2:27:06.900 --> 2:27:12.140]  see go look at every group he mentions big tax-free banking foundations funded
[2:27:12.140 --> 2:27:17.580]  continue two kinds of radicals here we've done the tree of revolution before
[2:27:17.580 --> 2:27:22.060]  we've had this now for several months there's a clowered and pivot type you
[2:27:22.060 --> 2:27:27.860]  know the one that says it was a hand he poses just like the teacher he fixes it
[2:27:27.860 --> 2:27:33.060]  for you he talks to you like your fifth grade class and he's explaining it to
[2:27:33.060 --> 2:27:37.740]  you he's he's he's distorting for you continue takeover through financial
[2:27:37.740 --> 2:27:41.780]  collapse and the reset of the system back that up in pivot back that up I want
[2:27:41.780 --> 2:27:49.140]  to take the revolutionary communists that he's about to cover they are taking
[2:27:49.140 --> 2:27:55.100]  over through a control collapse you have a perfectly coordinated Bill Clinton
[2:27:55.100 --> 2:27:59.820]  changes the laws for the derivatives all the major Goldman Sachs JP Morgan
[2:27:59.820 --> 2:28:03.900]  Chase people continue under Bush they put all their money into Obama continue
[2:28:03.900 --> 2:28:06.660]  they've now shifted the New York Times reported into getting all their money
[2:28:06.660 --> 2:28:12.380]  into Republicans because that's the new fake counter-revolution so see he's
[2:28:12.380 --> 2:28:16.940]  telling you the bank not the bankers are collapsing communists did this he goes
[2:28:16.940 --> 2:28:20.740]  on to say Obama's people did the economic collapse they did the banker
[2:28:20.740 --> 2:28:24.620]  bailout not Glenn Beck with White House talking points saying it's not big
[2:28:24.620 --> 2:28:31.860]  enough we've got to have this George Bush is a great man see because there's
[2:28:31.860 --> 2:28:35.420]  no difference between him and the establishment people in the White House
[2:28:35.420 --> 2:28:39.660]  but he needs to give you that fake image of a difference I mean this is all lies
[2:28:39.660 --> 2:28:42.340]  is why I keep stopping and I mean it's just all that's why I can't play these
[2:28:42.340 --> 2:28:47.580]  clips here every five seconds is a lie play it again there's a clowered in
[2:28:47.580 --> 2:28:51.420]  pivot type you know the one that says there's peaceful takeover through
[2:28:51.420 --> 2:28:56.900]  financial collapse and the reset of the system clowered in Pippin and that went
[2:28:56.900 --> 2:29:03.980]  this way acorn the other kind has violent radicals imposing errors now
[2:29:03.980 --> 2:29:07.660]  acorn caused the financial collapse no they were part of the big foundations
[2:29:07.660 --> 2:29:11.900]  getting inner-city people in debt as we've had Catherine Austin Fitzsond who
[2:29:11.900 --> 2:29:15.300]  was there at the time telling you how they set it up but that was the big
[2:29:15.300 --> 2:29:22.540]  banks acorn is just one tiny little thumbnail on the hand we're gonna come
[2:29:22.540 --> 2:29:26.700]  back I'm gonna try to play longer clips and analyze it it's just that's the
[2:29:26.700 --> 2:29:32.820]  thing about Beck when you're actually informed it's all lies oh he'll be right
[2:29:32.820 --> 2:29:35.620]  and saying I'm against government takeover of health care or the government
[2:29:35.620 --> 2:29:39.900]  controlling your thermostats he doesn't tell you Rick Perry got that through the
[2:29:39.900 --> 2:29:43.740]  legislature and this office now has a remote control thermostat in it no he
[2:29:43.740 --> 2:29:47.380]  tells you Rick Perry's gonna save you so he'll tell you the problem but not
[2:29:47.380 --> 2:29:51.940]  explain to you who's behind it both parties we'll be back we're on the
[2:29:51.940 --> 2:29:59.780]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[2:33:18.620 --> 2:33:23.980]  election this is a guy who is clearly a psyop he has more open CIA officers on
[2:33:23.980 --> 2:33:30.740]  than any other show they are there manipulating you and he hasn't even
[2:33:30.740 --> 2:33:34.300]  gotten to the part yet he already said this is why Obama's in danger then he
[2:33:34.300 --> 2:33:42.060]  says that 9-11 truth is gonna kill him I mean talk about a demonization people
[2:33:42.060 --> 2:33:47.460]  that question 9-11 incredibly diverse group all over the world the number two
[2:33:47.460 --> 2:33:50.580]  guy in the Japanese government all these other world leaders the former German
[2:33:50.580 --> 2:33:55.580]  defense minister all these engineers all these people we're violent we're bad
[2:33:55.580 --> 2:34:01.020]  we're gonna go after Obama total false flag in the making let's continue
[2:34:01.020 --> 2:34:07.740]  kind of radicals that bombed the Pentagon when he when he was in the
[2:34:07.740 --> 2:34:11.620]  newspaper the New York Times it was on September 11th he said this quote I don't
[2:34:11.620 --> 2:34:17.180]  regret setting bombs I feel we didn't do enough Paul Watson I talked to him talk
[2:34:17.180 --> 2:34:21.140]  about him a couple of days ago he said this quote he's that whale activist there's
[2:34:21.140 --> 2:34:26.900]  nothing wrong with being a terrorist as long as you win then you write the
[2:34:26.900 --> 2:34:30.220]  history I'd stop
[2:34:31.060 --> 2:34:36.260]  bill airs patty hearse it's all been declassified they were working for the
[2:34:36.260 --> 2:34:41.380]  government they were funded they were protected they were allowed to blind
[2:34:41.380 --> 2:34:46.140]  police officers bombed the Pentagon all of this as a pretext to build up the
[2:34:46.140 --> 2:34:54.740]  Cointel pro spying network on the American people it's on record why do
[2:34:54.740 --> 2:34:56.940]  you think these people most of them didn't go to prison what do you think
[2:34:56.940 --> 2:35:03.220]  Bill Clinton commuted a bunch of their status sentences again these are high
[2:35:03.220 --> 2:35:08.460]  powered big money funded groups the Rockefeller Foundation and others all
[2:35:08.460 --> 2:35:15.300]  fund the left and the right just like they've been caught in Denver and in
[2:35:15.300 --> 2:35:21.060]  areas of Canada like Ottawa with paid government operatives dressed up like
[2:35:21.060 --> 2:35:25.980]  anarchist attacking crowds of people and the media says wow incredible police
[2:35:25.980 --> 2:35:31.220]  restraint this just happened yesterday in Canada and then it turns out their
[2:35:31.220 --> 2:35:35.500]  cops so you see a day or two of people breaking trash cans hitting cops the
[2:35:35.500 --> 2:35:38.780]  cops are told to stand down and then a couple days later they attack the
[2:35:38.780 --> 2:35:42.860]  peaceful crowds people said well they had it coming and then people are scared
[2:35:42.860 --> 2:35:46.180]  to go out and demonstrate because there's always these anarchists there who
[2:35:46.180 --> 2:35:50.780]  we've proven are government operatives this is on record these are rena mobs
[2:35:50.780 --> 2:35:57.100]  funded by the big foundations again let's continue got it Andy Stern SEIU
[2:35:57.100 --> 2:36:02.620]  president leading White House visitor workers of the world unite it's not just
[2:36:02.620 --> 2:36:07.260]  a slogan anymore give me some of these give me some of these pictures let me
[2:36:07.260 --> 2:36:12.460]  ask you this question do you are you like any of these people are you like
[2:36:12.460 --> 2:36:18.580]  William Ayres we don't regret setting off any bombs back it up a few seconds
[2:36:18.580 --> 2:36:22.780]  see and like a child are you like these people no you don't want to be like this
[2:36:22.780 --> 2:36:26.300]  guy setting off bombs and then he connects with the 9-11 truth here in a
[2:36:26.300 --> 2:36:31.020]  moment see the message is you're a terrorist and then he has this left
[2:36:31.020 --> 2:36:35.140]  right paradigm on the chalkboard the left over here the right over here he
[2:36:35.140 --> 2:36:39.860]  says America is right of center no in that false paradigm we're way liberals
[2:36:39.860 --> 2:36:44.980]  don't the grassroots are now pro-second amendment grassroots the numbers have
[2:36:44.980 --> 2:36:49.980]  shifted their anti-abortion grassroots so-called mainline liberals don't like
[2:36:49.980 --> 2:36:54.820]  the big banks under Bush or under Obama so he always says it's about getting
[2:36:54.820 --> 2:36:58.740]  outside the left right paradigm using my term I coined but then every time he
[2:36:58.740 --> 2:37:03.420]  shows a graphic it's a left right paradigm and then he puts all these
[2:37:03.420 --> 2:37:09.300]  radicals over on the side of Obama's administration most of them are out there
[2:37:09.300 --> 2:37:13.900]  on the fringes foundation funded he doesn't mention all the big Israeli
[2:37:13.900 --> 2:37:17.060]  operatives and British operatives and globalist operatives that are in the
[2:37:17.060 --> 2:37:22.780]  winehouse who say arrest anyone who has these views no he gives you the left
[2:37:22.780 --> 2:37:28.980]  right paradigm here it is question do you are you like any of these people are
[2:37:28.980 --> 2:37:33.620]  you like William Ayres we don't regret setting off any bombs are these people
[2:37:33.620 --> 2:37:38.020]  like you are they like our founders we're normally in the center we're
[2:37:38.020 --> 2:37:42.500]  actually a country that is center right okay we don't like the extreme right we
[2:37:42.500 --> 2:37:47.300]  don't like the extreme left we're about here good pause okay are you like the
[2:37:47.300 --> 2:37:51.740]  terrorist or are you like our founders well wait a minute our founders talked
[2:37:51.740 --> 2:37:56.620]  about government staging fake crises our founders said don't get involved in
[2:37:56.620 --> 2:37:59.300]  foreign entanglements don't let foreign governments come in and take your
[2:37:59.300 --> 2:38:03.420]  government over we've had global corporations come in that are bigger
[2:38:03.420 --> 2:38:09.300]  than most governments takeover our founders Glenn would have supported Ron
[2:38:09.300 --> 2:38:14.580]  Paul not you who were for the banker takeover bailout that you go on to blame
[2:38:14.580 --> 2:38:17.540]  on the communist and certainly they're part of it and they want things to
[2:38:17.540 --> 2:38:22.020]  collapse but so do the Republicans and they all worked in tandem seamless
[2:38:22.020 --> 2:38:27.540]  integration between Clinton Bush Obama but oh no the Republicans are gonna save
[2:38:27.540 --> 2:38:32.540]  you again back to his fake left right paradigm where would where would I put a
[2:38:32.540 --> 2:38:39.500]  guy who bombed the Pentagon here who doesn't regret and says he didn't do
[2:38:39.500 --> 2:38:45.260]  enough how about Andy Stern workers of the world unite is he here he's on the
[2:38:45.260 --> 2:38:50.780]  extreme left Ron Bloom this a guy who said we kind of agree with Chairman Mao
[2:38:50.780 --> 2:38:57.060]  that political power largely comes from the barrel of a gun do you believe that
[2:38:57.060 --> 2:39:03.980]  I don't largely believe it I don't kind of believe it I don't believe it I think
[2:39:03.980 --> 2:39:08.820]  he's over here Anita Dunn one of her favorite political philosophers is Mao
[2:39:08.820 --> 2:39:16.460]  and lost a guy yes and one of David Rockefeller one of his and he's on
[2:39:16.460 --> 2:39:23.940]  record helping fund news core and clear channel on record so you can control the
[2:39:23.940 --> 2:39:30.980]  opposition the best way to control is to lead it he wrote in 1976 he wrote
[2:39:30.980 --> 2:39:34.820]  multiple editorials but one in 76 praising Mao as one of his favorite
[2:39:34.820 --> 2:39:45.300]  philosophers called him a philosopher our government kick Shanghai check out
[2:39:45.300 --> 2:39:50.300]  that's now been declassified our government helped put linen in and then
[2:39:50.300 --> 2:39:54.100]  when Stalin got out of control he was certainly really bad and kicked out the
[2:39:54.100 --> 2:39:59.300]  Trotskyites they came over here and William Crystal's father founded the
[2:39:59.300 --> 2:40:05.220]  neoconservative movement that you work for I mean what about communist in the
[2:40:05.220 --> 2:40:08.300]  White House Bush had a lot more but they're not communist they use that as
[2:40:08.300 --> 2:40:12.900]  a banner to take over societies let's continue who now these are just people
[2:40:12.900 --> 2:40:17.660]  these people are in and around the White House this guy isn't but this is where
[2:40:17.660 --> 2:40:22.420]  Obama launched his campaign at this man's house for 20 years he said in
[2:40:22.420 --> 2:40:26.740]  this man's church this man says the government gives people drugs and then
[2:40:26.740 --> 2:40:33.180]  wants us to sing God bless America no no no the rest of the government gives us
[2:40:33.180 --> 2:40:39.820]  drugs see and they also have the control left like Reverend Wright come out and
[2:40:39.820 --> 2:40:43.980]  say the government created HIV that's declassified but never give any evidence
[2:40:43.980 --> 2:40:48.180]  and the government ships the drugs in well they mean they had a congressional
[2:40:48.180 --> 2:40:53.540]  hearings and the CIA inspector general in 1996 admitted they ship in the majority
[2:40:53.540 --> 2:40:58.140]  of the narcotics oh but see now if you don't trust the government and you know
[2:40:58.140 --> 2:41:01.620]  the government shipping drugs in is Ron Paul exposed in that speech a month ago
[2:41:01.620 --> 2:41:06.460]  and Ron Paul so we've got a CIA coup and they're shipping the drugs in oh you're
[2:41:06.460 --> 2:41:11.940]  with Reverend Wright see I'm not a left-winger or a right-winger if something's
[2:41:11.940 --> 2:41:15.620]  the truth I talk about it and I talk about how big government's the tool of
[2:41:15.620 --> 2:41:21.420]  control whether it's from the fake rate right or the fake left but see Glenn
[2:41:21.420 --> 2:41:26.220]  Beck makes it all a left-wing thing to think the government deals drugs or the
[2:41:26.220 --> 2:41:30.660]  government's engaged in population reduction so that the right wing watching
[2:41:30.660 --> 2:41:34.580]  this won't fully wake up and the left in Newsweek and Time comes out and attacks
[2:41:34.580 --> 2:41:38.740]  the right wing and says oh look it's a right wing thing to believe the UN wants
[2:41:38.740 --> 2:41:44.460]  to reduce your numbers and to believe the government's dealing drugs see when
[2:41:44.460 --> 2:41:49.300]  Bush is in office it's a left-wing thing to talk about FEMA camps when Obama is
[2:41:49.300 --> 2:41:53.740]  in office it's a right-wing thing no it's the truth but as long as they can
[2:41:53.740 --> 2:41:58.260]  divide you into two groups to fight they win and everything Beck does is that so
[2:41:58.260 --> 2:42:01.420]  he knows you're waking up to this so he comes in and says I'm against the left
[2:42:01.420 --> 2:42:06.100]  right paradigm now here's a graphic of the left right paradigm continue that he
[2:42:06.100 --> 2:42:09.420]  says it's in the Bible that's what happens to countries for killing innocent
[2:42:09.420 --> 2:42:13.780]  people so he's surrounded oh wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute Reverend
[2:42:13.780 --> 2:42:18.220]  Wright says that the Arabs attacked us because we were oppressing them that's
[2:42:18.220 --> 2:42:24.220]  what the big foundation funded award Churchill says she 911 truth never said
[2:42:24.220 --> 2:42:29.020]  that we know it was staged we know radical Muslims are funded to overthrow
[2:42:29.020 --> 2:42:38.140]  mainline regimes in the Middle East and Central Asia see most these people he
[2:42:38.140 --> 2:42:44.580]  puts up here prop up like Noam Chomsky and Howard Zen the official line that
[2:42:44.580 --> 2:42:50.020]  911 was not an inside job the left the control left has been the biggest
[2:42:50.020 --> 2:42:58.000]  attacker of 911 truth it's all fraud when you know the truth everything
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:02.660]  Lynn Beck says is a twisted distortion a spin or an outright lie continue with
[2:43:02.660 --> 2:43:08.300]  this liar surrounded by radicals here's why the Republic is in danger and the
[2:43:08.300 --> 2:43:14.420]  president is in danger first then the Republic back it up hit pause back it up
[2:43:14.420 --> 2:43:18.860]  10 seconds here's why the Republic's in danger not that big offshore banks that
[2:43:18.860 --> 2:43:23.140]  openly want worldwide eugenics and world government are in control not that
[2:43:23.140 --> 2:43:26.980]  they've stolen 28 plus trillion and counting in the last year and a half not
[2:43:26.980 --> 2:43:30.900]  that it's bipartisan not that Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase own both
[2:43:30.900 --> 2:43:35.140]  parties not that North com is setting up all these FEMA camps not that they're
[2:43:35.140 --> 2:43:38.620]  launching all these wars based on lies not that troops are suddenly running
[2:43:38.620 --> 2:43:43.900]  checkpoints all over the country with any excuse they get no the Republic is
[2:43:43.900 --> 2:43:46.580]  in danger he now brings you to the ultimate enemy you don't like
[2:43:46.580 --> 2:43:49.780]  communists you don't like these socialists you don't like people that
[2:43:49.780 --> 2:43:56.140]  bomb the Pentagon who all prop up the official 911 story guilt by association
[2:43:56.140 --> 2:44:01.140]  now he brings in Van Jones the only one they kicked out because broken clocks
[2:44:01.140 --> 2:44:07.820]  are right twice a day and blind hogs do occasionally find acres because now he
[2:44:07.820 --> 2:44:13.620]  can make it a left-wing issue for 911 truth when the truth is it was the
[2:44:13.620 --> 2:44:17.820]  libertarians and true constitutionalist that exposed 911 from day one you're
[2:44:17.820 --> 2:44:21.860]  looking at the founder of the 911 truth movement I'm the guy that had the nerve
[2:44:21.860 --> 2:44:25.540]  to tell the truth before it happened and after it happened I understood how
[2:44:25.540 --> 2:44:31.340]  important it was to take false flag terror away from these people and we've
[2:44:31.340 --> 2:44:34.660]  used this radio show as a platform for all the real leaders against the new
[2:44:34.660 --> 2:44:37.860]  world order to build them up to where you now see them as pundits on their
[2:44:37.860 --> 2:44:42.940]  national television like Webster Tarpley from obscurity to being well known
[2:44:42.940 --> 2:44:47.220]  continue with glen beckis here he comes in with the danger to the republic it's
[2:44:47.220 --> 2:44:51.740]  not the big banks it's not the new world order it's a few leftists they had in the
[2:44:51.740 --> 2:44:55.900]  White House for left cover to pacify the left here it is in the bible that's
[2:44:55.900 --> 2:45:00.700]  what happens to countries for killing innocent people so he's surrounded by
[2:45:00.700 --> 2:45:06.860]  radicals surrounded by radicals here's why the republic is in danger and the
[2:45:06.860 --> 2:45:14.020]  president is in danger first then the republic here's this tree of revolution
[2:45:14.020 --> 2:45:18.740]  we talked to you about clowered in Piven these were the Marxist students these
[2:45:18.740 --> 2:45:25.460]  were people like this guy SDS okay right here is when they think yeah Che
[2:45:25.460 --> 2:45:31.340]  that's the way to go they want a real revolution guns blood in the street SDS
[2:45:31.340 --> 2:45:36.340]  clowered in Piven come along and they say no no no wait a minute we can just
[2:45:36.340 --> 2:45:42.420]  infiltrate and collapse the system we can overwhelm it those people say yes
[2:45:42.420 --> 2:45:47.820]  Wade Rathke Dale Rathke SCIU Acorn they move over in this direction they say
[2:45:47.820 --> 2:45:53.420]  yes we'll do it peaceful it was peaceful it was so they're going to do it
[2:45:53.420 --> 2:45:59.340]  peacefully so now it's acorn that collapse things stop the big banks
[2:45:59.340 --> 2:46:03.980]  glenbeck's for the banker bailout it's acorn now we know acorns bad and
[2:46:03.980 --> 2:46:09.260]  involve all sorts of criminality we were exposing it before glenbeck was this is
[2:46:09.260 --> 2:46:13.260]  community organizing this is how the government gets you dependent but that's
[2:46:13.260 --> 2:46:17.260]  a lie that they're behind the collapsing economy it's the new world order it's
[2:46:17.260 --> 2:46:25.780]  NAFTA GATT it's globalization and who exposed that who's off the air now
[2:46:25.780 --> 2:46:30.500]  Lou Dobbs who isn't perfect but he's for real he believes what he's saying he's
[2:46:30.500 --> 2:46:38.140]  not a globalist he's gone in comes glenbeck let's continue if Jones who by
[2:46:38.140 --> 2:46:44.580]  the way is the co-founder William Ayres and Jeff Jones the co-founder of the
[2:46:44.580 --> 2:46:51.660]  weather underground those guys say no blood and guns and they go this way okay
[2:46:51.660 --> 2:46:57.820]  this guy see this is his rap sheet or his fingerprints this guy's simple as
[2:46:57.820 --> 2:47:03.820]  again notice instead of a tree it should be a pincer beetle Google pincer beetle
[2:47:03.820 --> 2:47:10.380]  for me it's got two pincers it grabs its prey in two big mandible claws on the
[2:47:10.380 --> 2:47:15.700]  front of its face it should be the big banks are financing peaceful takeover
[2:47:15.700 --> 2:47:19.860]  while also financing radical takeover as a pretext to bring in a police state
[2:47:19.860 --> 2:47:24.620]  to suppress the general public but no you get a stupid tree that has no right
[2:47:24.620 --> 2:47:32.180]  wing control on it no big foundation control no nothing continue he is no
[2:47:32.180 --> 2:47:36.460]  he's not in prison I mean in the system he's in New York he actually helped New
[2:47:36.460 --> 2:47:40.780]  York spend the stimulus money because he works for this the Apollo Alliance
[2:47:40.780 --> 2:47:46.580]  where van jones also worked they helped design the stimulus package they have
[2:47:46.580 --> 2:47:54.700]  never denied it is a they helped design the stimulus package the very same
[2:47:54.700 --> 2:47:58.900]  Goldman Sachs that has all its people in the regulatory positions in the private
[2:47:58.900 --> 2:48:03.860]  Federal Reserve and the Treasury and in the White House are the ones that
[2:48:03.860 --> 2:48:07.660]  engineered the banker bailout that republicans and that bush and obama
[2:48:07.660 --> 2:48:14.260]  supported that beck supported and they also supported the stimulus and now
[2:48:14.260 --> 2:48:18.980]  he's telling you that somebody in an office in New York City at some little
[2:48:18.980 --> 2:48:26.380]  left cover group supported it and built it total lie continue bad thing these
[2:48:26.380 --> 2:48:33.820]  people over here these guys van jones radical militant now let me ask you

[2:54:15.740 --> 2:54:19.900]  new world order a couple communists. When he should be showing you a pincer
[2:54:19.900 --> 2:54:24.460]  beetle you know I'm saying stop looking at the pincers but look at the beetle
[2:54:24.460 --> 2:54:29.300]  that comes up and grabs you in its jaws. The control left the control right over
[2:54:29.300 --> 2:54:35.380]  there on the right you got Sarah Palin and you've got Glenn Beck on the fake
[2:54:35.380 --> 2:54:44.660]  left you've got Bill Ayers and Barack Obama and it's just that simple but the
[2:54:44.660 --> 2:54:49.740]  ultimate enemy you know they're gonna kill people the nonviolent 911 truth
[2:54:49.740 --> 2:54:53.860]  movement the one person who signed a petition once at some rally they kicked
[2:54:53.860 --> 2:54:57.340]  him out but he goes on the line and say they run the White House and they're
[2:54:57.340 --> 2:55:03.500]  gonna kill Obama they're gonna kill him because they want to come out of the
[2:55:03.500 --> 2:55:06.900]  911 truth movement they want to try to discredit us because we have broken
[2:55:06.900 --> 2:55:10.620]  their favorite mechanism but they don't understand that this is backfiring all
[2:55:10.620 --> 2:55:15.020]  the Newsweek all the Time Magazine all the CNN pieces all the National
[2:55:15.020 --> 2:55:20.300]  Geographic and PBS pieces trying to lie about 911 truth everybody's just
[2:55:20.300 --> 2:55:24.220]  looking into it now but these liars still think they can control people and
[2:55:24.220 --> 2:55:29.860]  it's backfiring so keep it up Beck see my possession is the truth what I value
[2:55:29.860 --> 2:55:34.740]  is the truth not being a political whore like you Beck sure if you ask around
[2:55:34.740 --> 2:55:38.700]  you'll find out I was basically offered the job you have ten years ago and then
[2:55:38.700 --> 2:55:44.060]  again about seven years ago and I said no thank you I don't want to be a star I
[2:55:44.060 --> 2:55:50.020]  want to tell the truth and in history you will be known as Benedict Arnold

[3:03:12.540 --> 3:03:18.820]  near the president I mean he thinks anybody who sits or set in the chair of
[3:03:18.820 --> 3:03:24.340]  the presidency must be evil get lost so now he's putting the guilt of 911 on to
[3:03:24.340 --> 3:03:32.220]  Obama and you better license these people you better register them as South

[3:11:48.620 --> 3:11:52.540]  in 2007 that they may want to blow things up remember that
[3:11:52.540 --> 3:11:56.700]  they want to bomb things no evidence you can pull the video clips up
[3:11:56.700 --> 3:12:05.740]  they may want to bomb things
[3:12:05.740 --> 3:12:08.860]  because that's what these guys do they accuse their enemies
[3:12:08.860 --> 3:12:14.060]  of planning to kill people they accuse their enemies of being terrorist

[3:14:51.980 --> 3:14:57.820]  spain portugal and several other european nations
[3:14:57.820 --> 3:15:01.180]  they're looting them just like they tried to bankrupt us in 2008
[3:15:01.180 --> 3:15:04.780]  did a pretty good job and then they get the bell out money and buy everything up
[3:15:04.780 --> 3:15:08.780]  for pennies on the dollar and i told you years ago the plan
[3:15:08.780 --> 3:15:12.620]  is to have currency wars between the dollar and between the euro and then
[3:15:12.620 --> 3:15:15.420]  say oh this has been too horrible after five years of this
[3:15:15.420 --> 3:15:19.100]  we've got to have a global standardization and now the g20 is calling
[3:15:19.100 --> 3:15:21.420]  for that they had a secret meeting last week
[3:15:21.420 --> 3:15:25.100]  that was mainstream news in australia of banks 24
[3:15:25.100 --> 3:15:29.660]  central banks meeting in secret to chart the future of the world to
[3:15:29.660 --> 3:15:33.180]  rig everything with their insider trading taylor
[3:15:33.180 --> 3:15:38.940]  in iowa you're on the air alex welcome
[3:15:38.940 --> 3:15:42.620]  yeah i uh called about a almost a month ago
[3:15:42.620 --> 3:15:46.700]  and i talked about how i was going to hand out
[3:15:46.700 --> 3:15:53.980]  uh swines of x in flyers in my school so i made flyers and uh i got
[3:15:53.980 --> 3:15:58.140]  one other person to help me out so we handed it out
[3:15:58.140 --> 3:16:04.140]  on the week of the clinic and the clinic was on friday
[3:16:04.140 --> 3:16:08.940]  and we handed it out about 60 flyers
[3:16:08.940 --> 3:16:15.100]  um so we had some altercations when people read
[3:16:15.100 --> 3:16:20.460]  one fact threw it away or just gave it back to me and said
[3:16:20.460 --> 3:16:24.940]  it was bs at least you tried to warn them
[3:16:24.940 --> 3:16:28.540]  there's likely worn people garters ill vaccine was killing people in the trials
[3:16:28.540 --> 3:16:32.300]  now it's known and hardly anybody's taking it it takes time
[3:16:32.300 --> 3:16:36.060]  but did the school try to restrict your free speech
[3:16:36.060 --> 3:16:41.820]  no they didn't at all good um yeah i was actually surprised by that because my
[3:16:41.820 --> 3:16:45.900]  school is actually really really closed minded i mean i live in iowa
[3:16:45.900 --> 3:16:49.820]  and it's one of the most conservative states in the country
[3:16:49.820 --> 3:16:54.860]  and i think the school is really really closed minded like i tell them how
[3:16:54.860 --> 3:17:01.260]  obama is calling for uh martial law and that there's fema camps
[3:17:01.260 --> 3:17:05.580]  and they're like oh no our country wouldn't do that we have such a great
[3:17:05.580 --> 3:17:09.180]  country our government's protecting us and all that
[3:17:09.180 --> 3:17:13.980]  i mean it was all it's all propaganda i mean they had stickers coming out that
[3:17:13.980 --> 3:17:18.700]  basically just said oh i'm so cool i got my flu shot
[3:17:18.700 --> 3:17:22.540]  and it's just all propaganda that's right they use fans taylor
[3:17:22.540 --> 3:17:26.780]  good job keep it up don't stop uh let's go to

[3:18:05.740 --> 3:18:08.940]  i'm not trying to steer you away from what you've been talking about but
[3:18:08.940 --> 3:18:13.500]  we uh we have four small children and i have become adamant about wanting to
[3:18:13.500 --> 3:18:16.380]  take them out of public school and home school them
[3:18:16.380 --> 3:18:19.420]  um there's a whole bunch of cutbacks going on they're going to be in large
[3:18:19.420 --> 3:18:22.620]  and classroom sizes they can't have the lights on it school
[3:18:22.620 --> 3:18:26.140]  they're taking away art they're taking away music let me stop you this is the
[3:18:26.140 --> 3:18:29.980]  oldest trick don't fill the potholes don't put new radios in the police cars

[3:18:33.340 --> 3:18:36.700]  bankers all these new taxes but oh you can't have
[3:18:36.700 --> 3:18:40.460]  the lights on oh you know austerity work it's for the
[3:18:40.460 --> 3:18:45.020]  environment absolutely look we homeschool our children if
[3:18:45.020 --> 3:18:48.380]  you can do it even if it means a lifestyle cutback is only one of you can
[3:18:48.380 --> 3:18:51.260]  work it is the best thing to do or put them in a small
[3:18:51.260 --> 3:18:55.660]  christian school that's exactly my husband works i'm a stay at home on
[3:18:55.660 --> 3:19:00.140]  anyway and two are in school and two are not old enough to be in school yet but
[3:19:00.140 --> 3:19:03.500]  my my husband's concern is he shows me these stories
[3:19:03.500 --> 3:19:07.100]  um that people have their children taken away by the government because they're
[3:19:07.100 --> 3:19:10.620]  right and they're doing that even though there's no law against homeschooling
[3:19:10.620 --> 3:19:13.660]  and the homeschoolers have the highest test scores and the best sociability
[3:19:13.660 --> 3:19:16.860]  everything they want to create a chilling effect so you don't
[3:19:16.860 --> 3:19:21.260]  so you're not living in a free country in your own mind if that keeps you from it

[3:19:31.900 --> 3:19:35.660]  yeah i mean that that is one of these chilling effects they've created
[3:19:35.660 --> 3:19:39.820]  well it's pretty sad when my second grader comes home and
[3:19:39.820 --> 3:19:44.860]  she's brilliant and have been doing math for before she was in school and it's
[3:19:44.860 --> 3:19:48.140]  pretty sad when she brings home math where she could get the same answer
[3:19:48.140 --> 3:19:52.060]  but she's not allowed to get the same answer because it's not their way
[3:19:52.060 --> 3:19:55.660]  and me and my husband can't even help her anymore i mean it's just let me look

[3:24:23.100 --> 3:24:26.460]  back and his key sabotage or attempted sabotage
[3:24:26.460 --> 3:24:31.020]  of Debra Medina i'm going to get into a really
[3:24:31.020 --> 3:24:36.380]  even more important news obama just says look i'm going after your guns with
[3:24:36.380 --> 3:24:39.260]  executive power i'm going after the borders with executive
[3:24:39.260 --> 3:24:41.900]  power i'm setting up a police state with executive
[3:24:41.900 --> 3:24:45.180]  power i'm federalizing your police with executive power
[3:24:45.180 --> 3:24:53.180]  i am doing all of this i'm going to launch new wars i'm going to pass the
[3:24:53.180 --> 3:24:57.260]  greenhouse gas taxes i don't need any stinking congress
[3:24:57.260 --> 3:25:00.860]  right now let's go back to your calls let's talk to amanda in florida
[3:25:00.860 --> 3:25:06.300]  amanda you're on the air hi alex um this is kind of off the subject but um
[3:25:06.300 --> 3:25:10.860]  my parents are sitting down right now as we speak with a gentleman saying that
[3:25:10.860 --> 3:25:13.180]  um the government's going to give you a three
[3:25:13.180 --> 3:25:16.380]  thousand dollar credit on your taxes if you put up
[3:25:16.380 --> 3:25:19.740]  solar panels but the catch is you can only use
[3:25:19.740 --> 3:25:23.580]  the government approved companies is about 35 of them
[3:25:23.580 --> 3:25:27.020]  and he also said that in hawaii it's mandatory
[3:25:27.020 --> 3:25:30.940]  and then he thinks that florida is going to start making it mandatory that you
[3:25:30.940 --> 3:25:34.940]  have to put these certain solar yes yes and then it's a boondoggle
[3:25:34.940 --> 3:25:38.780]  and they don't let most the states have passed it under federal funds
[3:25:38.780 --> 3:25:42.380]  but the states have to tailor the laws to match the feds
[3:25:42.380 --> 3:25:46.860]  and then you in some states it's only a few companies and it's a big boondoggle
[3:25:46.860 --> 3:25:50.380]  so it's overpriced then it costs more than you were told
[3:25:50.380 --> 3:25:54.060]  and they force you to get the health care they force you to get the solar panels
[3:25:54.060 --> 3:25:58.220]  and then they make you wire that into the regular grid
[3:25:58.220 --> 3:26:02.460]  and then you just get the quote credit for putting panels on your house so
[3:26:02.460 --> 3:26:06.060]  they're telling you how to live what to do oh it's for the greening
[3:26:06.060 --> 3:26:10.380]  oh it sounds reasonable everybody heard about california passing regulations
[3:26:10.380 --> 3:26:13.500]  with the government controls your thermostat and first they said oh well
[3:26:13.500 --> 3:26:18.060]  we'll just tax you when you use too much power now they're saying no
[3:26:18.060 --> 3:26:21.980]  we're going to control how hot or how cold your house is but we'll only do it
[3:26:21.980 --> 3:26:25.980]  in power shortages remember in ron got caught six seven years ago eight years
[3:26:25.980 --> 3:26:29.980]  ago now well almost 10 years ago jacking up power
[3:26:29.980 --> 3:26:32.780]  rates and then having fake blackouts and brownouts
[3:26:32.780 --> 3:26:36.780]  to create the perception that there was no power artificial scarcity so people
[3:26:36.780 --> 3:26:40.540]  would pay more this is all part of the new green tyranny
[3:26:40.540 --> 3:26:45.260]  all based on the lie that carbon dioxide is deadly poison so the frauds exposed
[3:26:45.260 --> 3:26:50.380]  but they're still going ahead with it and so uh yeah you better buy my product
[3:26:50.380 --> 3:26:53.260]  for me because it's going to be the law anyway soon
[3:26:53.260 --> 3:26:56.780]  instead of you having the option to get your own solar power
[3:26:56.780 --> 3:27:00.220]  see if they can make you take the solar systems they want the solar power
[3:27:00.220 --> 3:27:03.500]  systems then in the future you can't even have the systems you want
[3:27:03.500 --> 3:27:08.060]  you understand how this works oh i i totally understand they even made her
[3:27:08.060 --> 3:27:11.660]  fill out a questionnaire about how she feels like on a
[3:27:11.660 --> 3:27:16.460]  scale of one to five how important it is to try and save our precious oil
[3:27:16.460 --> 3:27:19.660]  they made her i mean i mean people are so passive now
[3:27:19.660 --> 3:27:23.820]  i mean i wouldn't answer the door with some punk salesman and i questioned her
[3:27:23.820 --> 3:27:28.300]  and i questioned the salesman i said what you need to ask yourself why
[3:27:28.300 --> 3:27:32.300]  the government saying use these companies why what's the purpose behind it
[3:27:32.300 --> 3:27:35.740]  and she's like well he showed me a pretty grid that shows that
[3:27:35.740 --> 3:27:39.500]  only you know we use all this electric but it's only 40 percent of all the
[3:27:39.500 --> 3:27:42.300]  energy that we use and i'm like i could make you a pretty grid
[3:27:42.300 --> 3:27:46.620]  and say whatever i want to stay on is that going to make you believe this
[3:27:46.620 --> 3:27:50.460]  amanda it's simple they want new ways to tax you to give the money to private
[3:27:50.460 --> 3:27:52.940]  banks and so they're just going to come in until
[3:27:52.940 --> 3:27:56.780]  you want to buy and what you can use and how you can live to quote destroy our
[3:27:56.780 --> 3:27:59.580]  industrial society and for every green job they
[3:27:59.580 --> 3:28:03.500]  create destroys two and the average job costs seven hundred
[3:28:03.500 --> 3:28:06.460]  thousand dollars to deliver a thirty five thousand
[3:28:06.460 --> 3:28:11.180]  dollar job i appreciate your call it's like austin
[3:28:11.180 --> 3:28:13.980]  they admit they want to shut down people using cars
[3:28:13.980 --> 3:28:18.620]  so the buses get 150 million a year of tax money and the revenue they make
[3:28:18.620 --> 3:28:23.500]  one percent of austin uses them and the roads get 76 million
[3:28:23.500 --> 3:28:28.460]  the roads get 76 million the bus is 150 million
[3:28:28.460 --> 3:28:31.660]  this is how the frauds work it's a managed economy
[3:28:31.660 --> 3:28:36.220]  where a select group gets to run the bus company or run the waste management
[3:28:36.220 --> 3:28:39.900]  it's all about mafia it's all about controlled monopolies
[3:28:39.900 --> 3:28:43.420]  let's go to adam in texas you're on the air adam
[3:28:43.420 --> 3:28:47.900]  hey alex jones uh i just wanted to bring up two fronts on the info war the first
[3:28:47.900 --> 3:28:50.460]  front is about the energy that she was talking about
[3:28:50.460 --> 3:28:54.620]  uh there's technologies um anybody can go online and look up free energy
[3:28:54.620 --> 3:28:58.140]  and the earth is going through space that's so fast and we can pull energy
[3:28:58.140 --> 3:29:00.860]  from that uh there's something called a geek reactor
[3:29:00.860 --> 3:29:04.300]  any engineers out there can go online get the blueprint and try to build one
[3:29:04.300 --> 3:29:08.540]  and uh once we get this energy uh that's the main news on around our neck
[3:29:08.540 --> 3:29:12.220]  and the other friend i wanted to talk about is the hemp how this is a great
[3:29:12.220 --> 3:29:15.180]  plant they took it away for a reason it's very healthy
[3:29:15.180 --> 3:29:18.780]  it's good for textiles and i think that uh there's a movie called run from the
[3:29:18.780 --> 3:29:21.660]  cure it's about a man he's making oil from it and it's
[3:29:21.660 --> 3:29:24.780]  curing cancer and other things for it's good for the nervous system i just
[3:29:24.780 --> 3:29:29.820]  wanted to bring up those i appreciate the call yeah there are scores of varieties
[3:29:29.820 --> 3:29:33.420]  of hemp with no thc that are better than cotton better for oil

[3:29:37.820 --> 3:29:41.420]  because of the drug laws has nothing to do with stopping drugs

[3:37:25.580 --> 3:37:28.380]  when the mainstream media started saying every child needs an implantable
[3:37:28.380 --> 3:37:32.140]  microchip it was pretty shocking back then and people got upset about it and
[3:37:32.140 --> 3:37:35.500]  then eight years ago when the mexican attorney general
[3:37:35.500 --> 3:37:39.820]  made his employees get chips and then i had police chiefs on who work
[3:37:39.820 --> 3:37:43.260]  for the company as consultants bergen county police chief they have police
[3:37:43.260 --> 3:37:46.780]  chiefs in the county there in new jersey saying i would make everybody take
[3:37:46.780 --> 3:37:49.500]  chips it was pretty shocking now they announce
[3:37:49.500 --> 3:37:51.580]  how people are getting chips and it's no big deal
[3:37:51.580 --> 3:37:55.900]  they just acclimate you to it even if you don't like it they break your will
[3:37:55.900 --> 3:38:00.700]  we cannot allow them to do that to us on any of these issues
[3:38:00.700 --> 3:38:05.260]  kentucky derby super bowl than college games high school games regular army
[3:38:05.260 --> 3:38:09.820]  marines national guard marine court checkpoints looking for drunk drivers
[3:38:09.820 --> 3:38:13.980]  on and on and on just to condition you to have troops on the streets
[3:38:13.980 --> 3:38:17.180]  secret police everywhere the federalization of police
[3:38:17.180 --> 3:38:21.820]  exchange programs with foreign countries in leo 9 with fema and troops from
[3:38:21.820 --> 3:38:25.740]  14 nations training fema admitted to take on the american
[3:38:25.740 --> 3:38:31.100]  people they admittedly have built all these fema
[3:38:31.100 --> 3:38:35.740]  camps and then glenn beckett's up and says they don't exist
[3:38:35.740 --> 3:38:40.860]  you're being acclimated and everything they've been building in the police
[3:38:40.860 --> 3:38:45.100]  state architecture since the establishment killed
[3:38:45.100 --> 3:38:47.740]  kennedy and he wasn't perfect but he wasn't going along with it
[3:38:47.740 --> 3:38:51.980]  they've been slowly building and federalizing and slowly setting it up
[3:38:51.980 --> 3:38:55.180]  where if you think executive orders outside of congress
[3:38:55.180 --> 3:38:58.380]  and the courts making unconstitutional regulatory laws
[3:38:58.380 --> 3:39:01.180]  where the regulatory agencies do what the president says
[3:39:01.180 --> 3:39:07.180]  and the law be damned if you think all of that is bad
[3:39:07.180 --> 3:39:11.420]  what about the signing statements that clinton started bush started expanding
[3:39:11.420 --> 3:39:14.620]  it now obama who swore he wouldn't do it we've all
[3:39:14.620 --> 3:39:17.260]  seen those video clips fact you have the signing statement
[3:39:17.260 --> 3:39:20.700]  uh clip guys i asked you to get
[3:39:20.700 --> 3:39:25.500]  remember that
[3:39:26.140 --> 3:39:31.900]  remember how he promised that they
[3:39:32.140 --> 3:39:36.860]  would never use signing statements of any type because it's unconstitutional
[3:39:36.860 --> 3:39:41.980]  because it's a federal power grab if you guys are looking for it again it's in
[3:39:41.980 --> 3:39:45.740]  the article you have it let's go ahead and play
[3:39:45.740 --> 3:39:49.340]  this short clip before i get into this here it is in congress
[3:39:49.340 --> 3:39:53.180]  offers you a bill do you promise not to use
[3:39:53.180 --> 3:40:05.580]  presidential signage to get your way
[3:40:05.900 --> 3:40:10.540]  let me just explain for those who are unfamiliar with this issue
[3:40:10.540 --> 3:40:14.380]  you know we've got a government designed by the founders
[3:40:14.380 --> 3:40:18.780]  so that there'd be checks and balances you don't want a president who's too
[3:40:18.780 --> 3:40:22.060]  powerful or congress is too powerful or of course it's too powerful
[3:40:22.060 --> 3:40:27.500]  everybody's got their own role congress's job is to pass legislation
[3:40:27.500 --> 3:40:31.420]  the president can veto it or he can sign it but what george bush has been
[3:40:31.420 --> 3:40:36.940]  trying to do as part of his effort to accumulate more power in the presidency
[3:40:36.940 --> 3:40:43.340]  is he's been saying well i can basically change what congress passed
[3:40:43.340 --> 3:40:47.260]  by attaching a letter saying i don't agree with this part or i don't agree
[3:40:47.260 --> 3:40:52.220]  with that part i'm going to choose to interpret it this way or that way
[3:40:52.220 --> 3:40:56.540]  that's not part of his power but this is part of the whole theory of george
[3:40:56.540 --> 3:41:00.220]  bush that he can make laws as he's going along
[3:41:00.220 --> 3:41:03.980]  i disagree with that i taught the constitution for 10 years
[3:41:03.980 --> 3:41:07.500]  i believe in the constitution and i will obey the constitution of the united
[3:41:07.500 --> 3:41:11.340]  states we're not going to use signing statements as a way of doing an end
[3:41:11.340 --> 3:41:17.900]  run around congress all right everything he says is a lie
[3:41:17.900 --> 3:41:22.220]  just like everything glenn beck says is a lie
[3:41:22.220 --> 3:41:25.980]  he says a couple communists imploded the banking structure
[3:41:25.980 --> 3:41:32.380]  when he supported the banker takeover same thing with obama
[3:41:33.660 --> 3:41:37.340]  most of the people in the bush administration stayed over
[3:41:37.340 --> 3:41:42.860]  into obama's administration and that's what i tried to explain in the obama
[3:41:42.860 --> 3:41:45.500]  deception fall the republic that's why those films
[3:41:45.500 --> 3:41:49.100]  are more important today than when i made them last year
[3:41:49.100 --> 3:41:52.780]  because you can set a republican down or a democrat down in front of those
[3:41:52.780 --> 3:41:55.340]  films and then there won't be any more confusion
[3:41:55.340 --> 3:42:01.340]  they'll understand the bigger ball game said to be in con now
[3:42:01.340 --> 3:42:05.180]  obama says he doesn't care if the congress doesn't pass a greenhouse gas tax
[3:42:05.180 --> 3:42:07.900]  that will completely shut down what's left of our industry
[3:42:07.900 --> 3:42:12.220]  double the amount that the electricity cost even admits that in a video clip
[3:42:12.220 --> 3:42:16.220]  double your electricity bill that that's not me just saying that
[3:42:16.220 --> 3:42:21.180]  that's on record that he wants to quote bankrupt them
[3:42:21.180 --> 3:42:24.780]  and china and india and mexico and a hundred plus other countries
[3:42:24.780 --> 3:42:31.740]  it's 160 total 165 total they don't have to make any cuts
[3:42:31.740 --> 3:42:35.420]  so even if you believe carbon oxide's so deadly and it's and we're burning up
[3:42:35.420 --> 3:42:39.660]  and everybody's gonna die how does china and india and
[3:42:39.660 --> 3:42:43.340]  mexico who will put out even dirtier emissions
[3:42:43.340 --> 3:42:46.860]  how does that save the earth when the total numbers
[3:42:46.860 --> 3:42:50.060]  of the devilish carbon oxide goes up i mean this is common
[3:42:50.060 --> 3:42:54.060]  sense but again he says gun control he announced that last month they're gonna
[3:42:54.060 --> 3:42:58.460]  go through the un with treaties and even if congress won't ratify it the
[3:42:58.460 --> 3:43:02.940]  senate won't ratify it he's going to do it open borders through spp
[3:43:02.940 --> 3:43:06.860]  he's saying he's going to go for open borders on that the executive branch is
[3:43:06.860 --> 3:43:09.580]  already issuing hemispheric north american you
[3:43:09.580 --> 3:43:13.580]  what was the exact name of it that's most of you've seen it
[3:43:13.580 --> 3:43:18.940]  what was the exact name of it that's most
[3:43:19.980 --> 3:43:27.100]  if you've seen it what was the exact name of it north american
[3:43:27.100 --> 3:43:33.740]  id commercial it's like a 60 second ad america the beautiful
[3:43:33.740 --> 3:43:37.500]  the wonder is now you can travel from mexico to canada and the u.s with this
[3:43:37.500 --> 3:43:44.060]  card they're just doing it north american
[3:43:44.060 --> 3:43:47.500]  hemisphere ids
[3:43:48.460 --> 3:43:51.900]  and it goes on and on and on the federalization of police
[3:43:51.900 --> 3:43:55.100]  shutting down a gun show in austin now other gun shows around the country
[3:43:55.100 --> 3:43:59.980]  no law the vatf just shows up and says that's the way it is
[3:43:59.980 --> 3:44:03.180]  you got the awesome police chief constantly meeting with the adl
[3:44:03.180 --> 3:44:08.380]  some bizarre libertarian blog attacks me and talks about how they go to the adl
[3:44:08.380 --> 3:44:11.260]  meetings no wonder when i showed up with that protest and they were running it
[3:44:11.260 --> 3:44:14.140]  they freaked out and caused that whole thing and ran up and said you're not
[3:44:14.140 --> 3:44:17.580]  welcome here when it was all my audience people in my t-shirt showing up
[3:44:17.580 --> 3:44:20.540]  and i was like well i'm going to bullhorn the media here now i find out
[3:44:20.540 --> 3:44:23.580]  they're writing articles about how great the adl is and how they meet with them
[3:44:23.580 --> 3:44:27.020]  and how i'm bad i mean it's just you can't believe this stuff
[3:44:27.020 --> 3:44:29.980]  they're just everywhere
[3:44:32.700 --> 3:44:38.300]  obama making plans to use executive power
[3:44:39.980 --> 3:44:43.020]  with much of his legislative agenda stalled in congress president obama
[3:44:43.020 --> 3:44:46.140]  and his team are preparing an array of actions used to
[3:44:46.140 --> 3:44:50.300]  his executive power to advance energy environmental fiscal and other domestic
[3:44:50.300 --> 3:44:54.460]  policy priorities that's the new york times
[3:44:54.460 --> 3:44:57.900]  and it says we will use executive orders and signing statements he's already
[3:44:57.900 --> 3:45:00.220]  doing it we are reviewing a list of
[3:45:00.220 --> 3:45:03.660]  presidential executive orders and directives to get the job done across a
[3:45:03.660 --> 3:45:07.820]  front of issues said rama manuel who is even american
[3:45:07.820 --> 3:45:11.980]  to the white house chief of staff i mean he is admitted member of the idf
[3:45:11.980 --> 3:45:15.020]  not even in israel first or he's in israeli and that's wrong it's like
[3:45:15.020 --> 3:45:19.260]  swords and eggers wrong for governor any president has vast authority to
[3:45:19.260 --> 3:45:22.300]  influence policy without legislation through executive orders
[3:45:22.300 --> 3:45:26.140]  agency rulemaking and administration fiat that's why they have cast sunsteen
[3:45:26.140 --> 3:45:29.180]  in there as the head of this the guy that says there
[3:45:29.180 --> 3:45:32.780]  should be no free speech and no internet free speech and now you hear it
[3:45:32.780 --> 3:45:36.860]  being announced by the media and they tell you oh the president's
[3:45:36.860 --> 3:45:40.380]  allowed to do this no he's not you just heard the president say
[3:45:40.380 --> 3:45:45.100]  it's wrong it's unconstitutional it's illegal
[3:45:45.100 --> 3:45:50.460]  and here's the key articles by kurt nimo obama declares
[3:45:50.460 --> 3:45:56.060]  he will rule by authoritarian decree info wars dot com this is important get
[3:45:56.060 --> 3:45:59.660]  it out to everybody kurt nimo the obama administration has announced it will
[3:45:59.660 --> 3:46:05.420]  now rule by fastest decree and ignore congress the american people
[3:46:10.460 --> 3:46:14.700]  and it goes on to say the fact that obama's plan to rule by authoritarian
[3:46:14.700 --> 3:46:18.700]  decree is unconstitutional article one section one of the u.s constitution
[3:46:18.700 --> 3:46:22.220]  states all legislative powers here in granted shall be
[3:46:22.220 --> 3:46:25.980]  vested in congress of the united states which shall consist of the senate and
[3:46:25.980 --> 3:46:29.980]  the house representatives article two section three states of the president
[3:46:29.980 --> 3:46:34.140]  may call congress an emergency session during a national crisis
[3:46:34.140 --> 3:46:37.900]  in other words rule by fiat is treason another section the constitution
[3:46:37.900 --> 3:46:41.500]  covers treason article two section four states the president vice president
[3:46:41.500 --> 3:46:45.340]  and all civil officers of the united states shall be removed from office
[3:46:45.340 --> 3:46:49.260]  of impeachment for and convicted of treason bribery or other high crimes
[3:46:49.260 --> 3:46:52.540]  and misdemeanors rama manual should be arrested and
[3:46:52.540 --> 3:46:57.260]  prosecuted for treason under federal statutes specifically title 18 usc
[3:46:57.260 --> 3:47:00.620]  two it states whoever commits an offense against the united states
[3:47:00.620 --> 3:47:05.020]  or aides abets counsel's commands induces or
[3:47:05.020 --> 3:47:11.660]  procures its commission is punishable as a principal
[3:47:11.660 --> 3:47:15.180]  treason is spelled out in article three section three of the constitution quote
[3:47:15.180 --> 3:47:19.820]  the congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason it states
[3:47:19.820 --> 3:47:27.500]  right there another great article obama breaks yet another campaign promise
[3:47:27.500 --> 3:47:32.060]  all joseph watson in the face of rapidly growing
[3:47:32.060 --> 3:47:35.020]  populist anger the obama administration has signaled
[3:47:35.020 --> 3:47:38.940]  that it will fall back on a form of power well known to all
[3:47:38.940 --> 3:47:42.620]  successful dictators rule by decree and obama will use
[3:47:42.620 --> 3:47:46.300]  the very instrument he campaigned against to ram through the new world order
[3:47:46.300 --> 3:47:50.700]  agenda executive orders and lots of them
[3:47:50.700 --> 3:47:55.900]  this is the definition of tyranus
[3:47:55.900 --> 3:48:00.700]  and this isn't like executive orders congress would give the president

[3:55:37.580 --> 3:55:40.940]  taxes to fund them which is what they openly announced world government i
[3:55:40.940 --> 3:55:45.020]  mean i'm a kook because i listen to what herman von rumpi the head of the eu
