[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:39.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:39.000 --> 00:47.000]  my friends it is official it is official Bloomberg Associated Press Reuters
[00:47.000 --> 00:55.600]  they're all reporting that at least 23.7 trillion has been stolen by the
[00:55.600 --> 01:00.600]  offshore banks and I've got video clip after video clip we're going over in the
[01:00.600 --> 01:05.840]  new Obama film where Bernanke and Geithner and others are before the House
[01:05.840 --> 01:12.480]  Committee Senate committees and they will not say where the money's gone of
[01:12.480 --> 01:18.000]  course they learned all of this they learned all of this from their good
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.680]  buddy George W. Bush and the famous Pentagon hearings where they're asking
[01:23.680 --> 01:27.800]  where are the trillions and trillions of missing dollars and Rumsfeld says I'm
[01:27.800 --> 01:37.440]  not going to tell you none of your business so it is just absolute
[01:37.440 --> 01:43.360]  criminality also USA today is reporting on this and I thought it was in my stack
[01:43.360 --> 01:49.080]  but it's not so guys you print me USA today and for listeners to just Google
[01:49.080 --> 01:57.040]  USA today or use your favorite search engine USA today Obama now tracking
[01:57.040 --> 02:02.080]  lower than Jimmy Carter Obama's approval rating now lower than Jimmy Carter at
[02:02.080 --> 02:12.240]  this same time six months into hair Carter's administration he had a higher
[02:12.240 --> 02:19.640]  approval rating than Barack Obama the jig is up the people now know he's a big
[02:19.640 --> 02:29.640]  fat stinking teleprompter reading fraud and now his whole agenda is stalling
[02:29.640 --> 02:36.600]  but look out you've got to have an ace in the hole a little secret that nobody
[02:36.600 --> 02:44.320]  knows life's just a gamble and that's exactly what's going on here they got
[02:44.320 --> 02:51.400]  stage terror up their sleeve you got to watch them very closely because I see
[02:51.400 --> 02:59.520]  Obama's fingers while he's busy complimenting our hats and our jackets
[02:59.520 --> 03:06.920]  and our our our dates here at the poker game well he's busy ordering a drink
[03:06.920 --> 03:13.640]  trying to distract us waving with his left hand for the waiter he is right
[03:13.640 --> 03:23.000]  hand fingers are tipping back into his sleeve and I see him pulling a card out
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.000]  and it's the ace of spades it's death
[03:28.560 --> 03:37.640]  George Bush played the ace of spades on 9-11 and even Michael Savage saw it
[03:37.640 --> 03:45.680]  coming months ago and he said mark my words mark my words Obama is gonna stage
[03:45.680 --> 03:49.720]  a terror attack and I agree with you let me tell you it's nice having some big
[03:49.720 --> 03:59.760]  time company somebody on 450 radio stations it's nice because I may not
[03:59.760 --> 04:02.240]  agree with something Savage says he certainly doesn't agree with some things
[04:02.240 --> 04:07.600]  I say but the issue is if it walks like a duck quacks like a duck it's got orange
[04:07.600 --> 04:11.720]  feet and a yellow body and it's quacking swimming around the local pond
[04:11.720 --> 04:16.720]  begging for bread it's a duck and we can look at this and know it is stage terror
[04:16.720 --> 04:21.440]  like a freight train coming you can hear it blowing its horn and let me tell you
[04:21.440 --> 04:27.360]  I see Obama going for that card because if he stages terror more than nine months
[04:27.360 --> 04:33.080]  out friend of mine in media was telling me media consultant was telling me about
[04:33.080 --> 04:37.840]  a book called shock therapy about Milton Friedman and I'd read Milton Friedman's
[04:37.840 --> 04:43.440]  comments on this but not the book the Economist about how a president has
[04:43.440 --> 04:48.880]  only got six to nine months to stage a terror attack stage a crisis yeah
[04:48.880 --> 04:53.200]  Milton Friedman was saying that and see we're coming up on nine months is
[04:53.200 --> 04:56.920]  Obama gonna hit us and hit his heart so we can learn to worship him as our
[04:56.920 --> 04:59.560]  savior

[05:11.560 --> 05:15.360]  chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water many of these
[05:15.360 --> 05:19.200]  chemicals are directly linked to cancer reproductive immune and developmental

[08:24.840 --> 08:33.000]  is a 22nd day of July on this Wednesday edition we have but one guest today for
[08:33.000 --> 08:37.400]  a full hour Gerald Solente always informative always thought-provoking
[08:37.400 --> 08:42.120]  always insightful he'll be joining us in the fourth hour today of the Trends
[08:42.120 --> 08:49.400]  Research Institute Gerald Solente today and I did a pretty good job yesterday
[08:49.400 --> 08:54.160]  but I want to do an even better job today because there's so much to chime in on
[08:54.160 --> 08:58.800]  so much to comment on I know the public out there is chomping at the bit on a
[08:58.800 --> 09:03.440]  thousand different important subjects and issues socialized government-controlled
[09:03.440 --> 09:09.200]  health care Obama's science are calling for a world government to take everyone's
[09:09.200 --> 09:13.520]  children at birth and sterilize them sterilizing us through the water food
[09:13.520 --> 09:18.800]  and air terraforming the planet so it's impossible to grow crops absolute total
[09:18.800 --> 09:24.080]  bondage and tyranny now making AP and Fox News weeks after we rammed it through
[09:24.080 --> 09:29.560]  and broke the story here by breaking it we picked up on a three-month-old story
[09:29.560 --> 09:35.480]  out of I guess four-month-old story out of front page magazine that didn't
[09:35.480 --> 09:38.640]  bother to actually have links to the book so people could see it for
[09:38.640 --> 09:42.280]  themselves as it is hard to believe they've got a plan to poison water food
[09:42.280 --> 09:47.280]  to kill us but Horowitz is a top neocon I mean what's he doing criticizing some
[09:47.280 --> 09:51.080]  of his bosses but he wants to make it look like it's a whole liberal issue but
[09:51.080 --> 09:55.720]  the point is you the listeners ram that story out into a national headline and
[09:55.720 --> 09:58.600]  now it's being debated all over talk radio the internet and mainstream
[09:58.600 --> 10:02.120]  television but with mainstream news is defending it in some cases going yeah
[10:02.120 --> 10:07.280]  maybe we do need to sterilize people maybe we do need to have one child
[10:07.280 --> 10:11.680]  policies Hillary Clinton over the weekend was in India said the same thing
[10:11.680 --> 10:18.920]  that was in CNS news associated press the Times of India she said yeah instead of
[10:18.920 --> 10:21.440]  just trying to have everybody reduce their carbon footprint how about we only
[10:21.440 --> 10:27.720]  have one child so it's really happening so we can discuss that there's just a
[10:27.720 --> 10:34.520]  host of issues to go over any issue you want to discuss 1-800-259-9231
[10:34.520 --> 10:43.040]  1-800-259-9231 we're gonna have open phones for the full four hours now three

[12:50.480 --> 13:05.280]  okay let me go over some of the news we have here in front of us Bloomberg AP
[13:05.280 --> 13:08.960]  and Reuters are now all reporting today what we were telling you about in the
[13:08.960 --> 13:16.360]  last few days Obama and Bush together partners and crime as frontmen for the
[13:16.360 --> 13:28.280]  offshore banks have stolen 23.7 trillion since mid-October when the money
[13:28.280 --> 13:32.440]  began to flow so let me see October November December January February
[13:32.440 --> 13:42.640]  March April May June July 10 months little less than 10 months nine and a
[13:42.640 --> 13:56.960]  half months so in nine and a half months they have stolen 23.7
[13:56.960 --> 14:03.920]  trillion and they weren't done rushing us they knew everybody hated Bush they
[14:03.920 --> 14:09.600]  slingshot it kind of like using the gravity of Saturn or Jupiter like a
[14:09.600 --> 14:16.720]  comet boomeranging around the Sun accelerating mass to then escape the
[14:16.720 --> 14:24.280]  solar system again they use the hatred the disgust the distrust the horror the
[14:24.280 --> 14:29.960]  panic at watching Bush up there the burnout drug addict bumbling and
[14:29.960 --> 14:35.760]  stuttering and looking completely disingenuous and looking like a character
[14:35.760 --> 14:43.560]  out of central casting for a psychopath burbling and arrogantly snapping at
[14:43.560 --> 14:47.880]  blind reporters telling him take their sunglasses off I mean just all of it he
[14:47.880 --> 14:53.160]  was just out of central casting they chose him to squeeze and squeeze the
[14:53.160 --> 14:58.960]  public in a submission to make the public rebel against him remember
[14:58.960 --> 15:04.120]  reading different letters written by different imperial kings of Rome known
[15:04.120 --> 15:13.720]  as Caesar is including Caesar the first Caesar Julius Caesar Caesar Augustus
[15:13.720 --> 15:21.560]  and the rest of them Constantine all of them they would brag to the Senate
[15:21.560 --> 15:26.240]  knowing that even the general public in Rome didn't read a lot there were only
[15:26.240 --> 15:33.680]  proclamations broadsheets handed out only the wealthiest had books done by
[15:33.680 --> 15:36.120]  scribes
[15:42.560 --> 15:51.160]  and so they would brag how they were manipulating people and they talk about
[15:51.160 --> 15:55.160]  one of the provinces of Rome to the east or to the north or to the south and
[15:55.160 --> 16:02.400]  at North Africa or to the west in Germanian Gaul and Britannia they called
[16:02.400 --> 16:05.440]  it I'll be on at the time
[16:12.320 --> 16:20.520]  I'll be on Judea all the different holdings and they would when they first
[16:20.520 --> 16:28.720]  dominated and took over they would put in a corrupt abusive leader a lot of
[16:28.720 --> 16:32.160]  times they'd put in one of the tribal chiefs of the group they just overthrown
[16:32.160 --> 16:37.120]  they'd put in someone unpopular with the tribes and then after a few years they
[16:37.120 --> 16:41.160]  would publicly execute him of course the stupid thug would never realize how
[16:41.160 --> 16:46.200]  they were being set up and then they would send in a Roman general who would
[16:46.200 --> 16:52.920]  save them from the tribal chief well we gave you the leader you wanted but now
[16:52.920 --> 17:00.400]  you'll accept a Roman legged and it's the same thing oh George W. Bush was so
[17:00.400 --> 17:04.560]  bad when it was nothing but a complete front man a puppet
[17:07.120 --> 17:23.200]  and now and now they gave you Obama and he had those first first few months to
[17:23.200 --> 17:29.000]  ram through all the different pieces of tyranny all the different pieces of
[17:29.000 --> 17:34.440]  legislation the federalization of the states the expansion of homeland
[17:34.440 --> 17:42.000]  security but a lot of his agenda is stalling the greenhouse gas takeover
[17:42.000 --> 17:45.680]  bill has passed the house but it's stalling in the Senate they'll probably
[17:45.680 --> 17:50.240]  still pass it we've got to fight tooth and nail his massive gun restriction
[17:50.240 --> 17:56.960]  bills are now stalled his open border legislation is stalled his entire
[17:56.960 --> 18:02.480]  criminal agenda is stalled and I'm telling you he's going to pull an ace
[18:02.480 --> 18:10.360]  card out of his sleeve and it's going to be stage chair or some type of flu
[18:10.360 --> 18:14.240]  outbreak panic I mean if they almost shut down society for two or three deaths
[18:14.240 --> 18:18.080]  imagine if it's just a regular flu season and is killing 30 plus thousand
[18:18.080 --> 18:23.920]  like it normally does it'll be the end of freedom they got the first inoculations
[18:23.920 --> 18:28.520]  ready the FEMA camps all of it or will it be a total financial collapse what is
[18:28.520 --> 18:35.840]  that ace card here's what Michael Savage had to say about it now I'll make
[18:35.840 --> 18:41.760]  another prediction I predict that very soon Obama will create a crisis along
[18:41.760 --> 18:45.720]  the lines of the Reichstag fire Reichstag fire I don't know what form it
[18:45.720 --> 18:49.560]  will take but I believe that once the minions are seen for what they are
[18:49.560 --> 18:54.200]  Ramah Manuel and his gang will set off a Reichstag fire in this country of some
[18:54.200 --> 18:58.560]  kind and they will recall the military dictatorship of Lincoln and Stanton
[18:58.560 --> 19:02.840]  during the Civil War when civil civilian suspects were arrested without warrant I
[19:02.840 --> 19:07.240]  will tell you as I sit here I fear that every night as I go to sleep I put
[19:07.240 --> 19:11.320]  nothing past these agitators who have suddenly seized control of the most
[19:11.320 --> 19:15.960]  powerful economy and the most powerful military on earth know my friends I am
[19:15.960 --> 19:20.520]  losing a great deal of sleep every night because I do see this happening right
[19:20.520 --> 19:25.440]  before my eyes again I will repeat what I just said mark it down I again tell you
[19:25.440 --> 19:28.480]  that there will be the equivalent of a crisis on the order of the Reichstag
[19:28.480 --> 19:32.760]  fire I don't know where it will occur I don't know how it will occur I don't know
[19:32.760 --> 19:37.280]  what form it will take but during this crisis that will be triggered by the
[19:37.280 --> 19:43.640]  Democrats around Obama the gang that surrounds Obama they will bring up
[19:43.640 --> 19:48.640]  Lincoln they will recall the military dictatorship of Lincoln in in other
[19:48.640 --> 19:52.800]  terms during the Civil War and they will do what Lincoln did and they will
[19:52.800 --> 19:59.800]  arrest civilians without warrant in our safe we'll be right back stay with us
[19:59.800 --> 20:04.400]  finally in the news this evening it's being reported that cyber spies from
[20:04.400 --> 20:09.040]  Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid even as energy experts are
[20:09.040 --> 20:12.440]  reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our
[20:12.440 --> 20:16.560]  nation's power grid some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may
[20:16.560 --> 20:21.000]  finally push the grid over its edge creating a cascade of power outages
[20:21.000 --> 20:25.520]  across the country putting us all in the dark are you prepared for the next
[20:25.520 --> 20:29.520]  round of storm related outages or government created blackouts have you
[20:29.520 --> 20:33.280]  ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own
[20:33.280 --> 20:37.640]  private supply of electrical power if so this will be the most important
[20:37.640 --> 20:42.280]  information you have ever heard solar powered generators are finally available
[20:42.280 --> 20:46.840]  they have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas

[21:06.080 --> 21:10.720]  property seizures frozen bank accounts confiscation of stocks and bonds it
[21:10.720 --> 21:14.000]  makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life

[24:33.640 --> 24:39.320]  would say the same old thing that you've been saying all along lay there in
[24:39.320 --> 24:45.880]  your bed keep your mouth shut till I'm gone don't give me that old familiar
[24:45.880 --> 24:54.280]  crying cuss and moan understand your man I'm tired of your bad mouth and
[24:54.280 --> 25:04.680]  understand your man so I just played you Michael Savage now I'm telling the
[25:04.680 --> 25:10.760]  truth no longer Michael Weiner I could play you Keith Oberman with Dick Cheney
[25:10.760 --> 25:16.640]  publicly being imported wanting to stage terror attacks on our own ships in
[25:16.640 --> 25:20.760]  the Strait of Hormuz to blame it on Iran a year and a half ago at that time
[25:20.760 --> 25:25.200]  we had Ray McGovern former chief CIA analyst for Ronald Reagan and George
[25:25.200 --> 25:29.840]  Bush senior on saying on air that the inside word was they were planting a
[25:29.840 --> 25:35.480]  gulf of Tonka and against our ships in the Strait of Hormuz or in the gulf and
[25:35.480 --> 25:41.920]  then of course it came out a year later that in 2007 we learned in 2008 that
[25:41.920 --> 25:48.480]  that is exactly what Dick Cheney was planning MSNBC New Yorker magazine then
[25:48.480 --> 25:52.640]  it also came out the White House memo Bush's plan to fly a US aircraft low
[25:52.640 --> 25:57.760]  over and over again hoping Iraqis would shoot it down painting it up as a UN
[25:57.760 --> 26:01.280]  aircraft to then lie and say that the UN aircraft had been shot down that
[26:01.280 --> 26:08.960]  Saddam had broken his truce the issue here is that they do this over and over
[26:08.960 --> 26:16.080]  again so I thought I'd pull up this article CFR heart suggests false flag
[26:16.080 --> 26:23.400]  event from Iran war this from September 27th 2007 right when all of our
[26:23.400 --> 26:30.640]  sources multiple former CIA multiple current Pentagon we're all telling us
[26:30.640 --> 26:36.040]  on and off air the same thing blow up a ship blow up a ship blow up a ship
[26:36.040 --> 26:41.360]  Admiral Fox Fallon quit shortly after saying he wouldn't be part of a
[26:41.360 --> 26:45.800]  provocation do you get what we're dealing with and if you think Obama won't do
[26:45.800 --> 26:51.840]  something like this don't hold your breath folks and let me read the
[26:51.840 --> 26:55.440]  unsolicited advice the government I ran Gary Hart's letter published in
[26:55.440 --> 27:00.040]  multiple newspapers in the Huffington Post and delivered to the Swiss embassy
[27:00.040 --> 27:05.320]  in Tehran the Swiss embassies where the US takes care of its diplomatic business
[27:05.320 --> 27:10.920]  does not have an official embassy since it was overrun in 1980 unsolicited
[27:10.920 --> 27:15.320]  advice to the government I ran presuming that you are not actually ignorant
[27:15.320 --> 27:19.600]  enough to desire war with the United States you might be well advised to read
[27:19.600 --> 27:25.640]  the history of the singing of the USS Maine in Havana Harbor in 1898 and the
[27:25.640 --> 27:31.560]  history of the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964 this is Gary Hart of the Hart Rudman
[27:31.560 --> 27:36.320]  Council on Foreign Relations Policy Board that drew up the entire Homeland
[27:36.320 --> 27:42.840]  Security Plan and was clearly involved in the 9-11 architecture I'll just leave
[27:42.840 --> 27:51.520]  it there having done so he continues you will surely recognize that Americans
[27:51.520 --> 27:57.000]  are reluctant to go to war unless attacked until Pearl Harbor we were even
[27:57.000 --> 28:01.160]  reluctant to get involved in World War two for historians of American Wars the
[28:01.160 --> 28:05.080]  question is whether we provoke provocations so he's saying here we
[28:05.080 --> 28:09.400]  provoke provocations he left the USS Maine in Havana Harbor blown up and the
[28:09.400 --> 28:14.960]  Gulf of Tonkin in 64 fake attack did never even happen thank God they didn't
[28:14.960 --> 28:18.080]  blow up a ship they just said it was blown up but that did lead over a million
[28:18.080 --> 28:22.840]  dead Vietnamese and 58,000 Americans dead and 300,000 with the arms and legs
[28:22.840 --> 28:30.120]  blown off and bullets wounds shattered spinal cords the list goes on and on but
[28:30.120 --> 28:34.200]  again this is Gary Hart presuming that you are not actually ignorant enough to
[28:34.200 --> 28:38.040]  desire war with the United States you might be well advised to read the
[28:38.040 --> 28:42.560]  history of the singing of USS Maine and Havana Harbor in 1898 and the history
[28:42.560 --> 28:46.040]  of the Gulf of Tonkin in 64 and if you read those histories it's admitted they
[28:46.040 --> 28:50.320]  were staged having done so you will surely recognize that Americans are
[28:50.320 --> 28:53.920]  reluctant to go to war unless attacked until Pearl Harbor we were even reluctant
[28:53.920 --> 28:57.200]  to get involved in World War two for historians of American Wars the question
[28:57.200 --> 29:02.320]  is whether we provoke provocations he continues given the unilateral US
[29:02.320 --> 29:07.080]  invasion of Iraq in 2003 you're obviously thinking the rulers have changed
[29:07.080 --> 29:12.280]  that the rules have changed the provocation is no longer required to
[29:12.280 --> 29:16.240]  take America to war but even in this instance we were led to believe that
[29:16.240 --> 29:20.840]  the mass murder of American civilians a sum of bin Laden was working literally
[29:20.840 --> 29:25.640]  or figuratively in the vicinity of Baghdad so he repeats here the fake
[29:25.640 --> 29:30.920]  provocation of saying that bin Laden was working with Saddam inside Iraq and he
[29:30.920 --> 29:33.480]  finishes up the letter when we get back and then straight to your phone calls

[34:08.400 --> 34:16.480]  government-sponsored terrorism it is a public secret in academia it is a
[34:16.480 --> 34:24.120]  public secret in the foreign service it is an open secret in intelligence it is
[34:24.120 --> 34:29.080]  an open secret in the military I didn't know this till this weekend but it's an
[34:29.080 --> 34:34.080]  open secret to Milton Friedman in books he wrote I knew about his economic view
[34:34.080 --> 34:37.200]  but never read any of his books and had a chance to look at a book that quoted
[34:37.200 --> 34:40.520]  one of his books and actually get one of his books yesterday where he talks about
[34:40.520 --> 34:45.760]  how you have nine months to stage crises as a president or as a leader to get
[34:45.760 --> 34:51.280]  your agenda through and I always wondered why the establishment had that nine
[34:51.280 --> 34:57.320]  month rule I knew about the nine month rule we pointed out that Bush staged the
[34:57.320 --> 35:04.520]  9-11 events or his handlers did in conjunction with being an office about
[35:04.520 --> 35:11.800]  eight and a half months it was an office from January 21st and then of course 911
[35:11.800 --> 35:17.760]  happened roughly eight and a half months later you can already see that with USA
[35:17.760 --> 35:27.240]  today reporting that Obama has the lowest approval rating ever recorded now
[35:27.240 --> 35:33.120]  you would think that should be the headline let's see USA today can't talk
[35:33.120 --> 35:44.520]  about their dear Obama that way and so they just have a boring headline I'm
[35:44.520 --> 35:52.760]  gonna get to that later after we take some phone calls but it shows that the
[35:52.760 --> 35:57.120]  last guy who had an approval rating that dropped as fast as Obama was Jimmy
[35:57.120 --> 36:03.440]  Carter and Obama is dropping faster than Jimmy Carter now what did Webster
[36:03.440 --> 36:07.320]  Tarpoli say in the Obama deception and what does he said on this show over and
[36:07.320 --> 36:17.400]  over in the last nine ten months since Obama was president-elect what has he
[36:17.400 --> 36:24.600]  said he has said over and over again that we want this his presidency to go
[36:24.600 --> 36:28.240]  like Jimmy Carter's we want to immediately shoot him down at the first
[36:28.240 --> 36:32.600]  hundred to three hundred days in office he that he was gonna bum rushes we're
[36:32.600 --> 36:38.520]  now halfway through that and he is stalling he is falling like a rock this
[36:38.520 --> 36:49.200]  is fabulous news but as sure as I am living and breathing just as sure as
[36:49.200 --> 36:56.200]  you were living and breathing they are gonna stage crises probably hot crises
[36:56.200 --> 37:02.640]  military crises stage terror crises it'd be better if they just staged a terror
[37:02.640 --> 37:06.080]  crisis I mean I mean it's sad if they kill a few thousand Americans and I hope
[37:06.080 --> 37:08.960]  they don't do it but it's better than launching an attack on Iran because that
[37:08.960 --> 37:15.480]  can get out of control and turn into a war with Russia or China so I hope the
[37:15.480 --> 37:20.320]  globalist if they do I know they're listening can you guys just kill a few
[37:20.320 --> 37:24.280]  thousand people I mean I know that's bad enough that you murder us but it's like
[37:24.280 --> 37:27.880]  the foster kids you take and radiate to death the black men at syphilis or the
[37:27.880 --> 37:31.400]  atomic soldiers or project Shad nerve-gassing our own troops to death I
[37:31.400 --> 37:35.000]  mean at least it doesn't get the Ruskies involved with the chai comms I
[37:35.000 --> 37:39.640]  mean if you got to kill somebody I guess kill us like you always do and a bunch
[37:39.640 --> 37:43.800]  of idiots will all go hug your leg and kiss your knee and worship you and it
[37:43.800 --> 37:47.000]  will I'll have to throw up repeatedly watching everybody worship the
[37:47.000 --> 37:55.920]  murderers but I don't know what Cheney was trying with that sneak attack on
[37:55.920 --> 38:00.040]  Russian held territories in south of the city in Abkhazia on 888 but boy that
[38:00.040 --> 38:04.960]  was dangerous wasn't it now we've got US forces and NATO forces and Israeli
[38:04.960 --> 38:09.920]  forces massing again in Georgia we've got US and NATO forces massing in
[38:09.920 --> 38:16.240]  Afghanistan and Pakistan all sorts of encirclement and provocations going on
[38:16.240 --> 38:23.360]  the economic crises is only deepening twenty seven point twenty three point
[38:23.360 --> 38:27.240]  seven twenty three point seven trillion stolen that's all coming up as well in
[38:27.240 --> 38:32.080]  the next hour that crisis is deepening
[38:34.440 --> 38:39.600]  are they gonna stage domestic terror I've seen a lot of preparations to quit
[38:39.600 --> 38:48.040]  playing the Muslim turban head card though that is up the sleeve economic
[38:48.040 --> 38:58.320]  crisis sleeve bio attack sleeve chemical attack sleeve height flu sleeve card or
[38:58.320 --> 39:05.080]  real bio attack flu card or they could have the good old boy militia card blow
[39:05.080 --> 39:09.800]  up a federal building I mean I hope the feds don't bomb a federal building and
[39:09.800 --> 39:15.080]  kill a few hundred of their of their minions but that if that's what it
[39:15.080 --> 39:18.360]  takes to get their people to circle the wagons against the US population if
[39:18.360 --> 39:22.760]  they got a punch their own minions in the nose to get them hyped up to like a
[39:22.760 --> 39:25.800]  suck beating the dog in the head with the two by four and turning it loose on
[39:25.800 --> 39:32.080]  somebody that is better than attacking Iran that'll kill a lot more of the
[39:32.080 --> 39:39.440]  federal federal federal puppies yeah I think that's in the cards to killing
[39:39.440 --> 39:47.200]  some killing some of their babies killing some of their larvae they like
[39:47.200 --> 39:51.400]  that they like killing their own minions against their minions all hopped up and
[39:51.400 --> 39:55.680]  angry and crying and feeling sorry for themselves and the other larvae really
[39:55.680 --> 39:59.440]  don't care you've deep down they know their bosses bombed them it's too much
[39:59.440 --> 40:03.560]  fun to squeeze the American people by the throat and feel powerful like stupid
[40:03.560 --> 40:14.280]  jackasses you sure love Clinton after he blew you sky high at okc didn't you so
[40:14.280 --> 40:17.640]  sure as the sun came up this morning and assured it's just gonna shut this
[40:17.640 --> 40:24.560]  evening just as sure as there's fish in the sea you can bet they're gonna pull
[40:24.560 --> 40:28.080]  some big fat Christ see so I want to hear from you the listeners what you think
[40:28.080 --> 40:31.280]  those are gonna be all right I've shut enough let's go to your phone calls
[40:31.280 --> 40:36.760]  Tony in Illinois you're on the air worldwide hey you know today Alex good
[40:36.760 --> 40:42.640]  sir hey I'll tell you what you know I was I got when I moved I just moved to a
[40:42.640 --> 40:46.360]  new apartment I come across a document that a friend of mine it gave me back
[40:46.360 --> 40:52.960]  in 1999 just this big long list of every potential type of you know terrorist
[40:52.960 --> 40:57.800]  weapon Lincoln I ran amazingly but all the way back in 99 talking about
[40:57.800 --> 41:04.240]  Iran and you know the backpack nukes scenario this that and the other it was
[41:04.240 --> 41:08.360]  interesting reading to be sure how but I can't find the cover sheet it came off
[41:08.360 --> 41:12.840]  at some point in the last you know ten years and without a cover sheet I
[41:12.840 --> 41:17.600]  realized it's kind of useless but so I tell you about that and you know there's
[41:17.600 --> 41:21.040]  hundreds of those reports and don't think that we have them all make copies
[41:21.040 --> 41:27.080]  send them to us but I have probably seen oh it's got to be more than a hundred
[41:27.080 --> 41:30.880]  reports that are federal I've seen a couple hundred more state reports we
[41:30.880 --> 41:34.080]  don't cover them a lot though I've learned that we should because each time
[41:34.080 --> 41:37.760]  it gets news attention because so many times it's a carbon copy of another
[41:37.760 --> 41:42.160]  state just with the heading changed but they say wearing blue jeans talking on
[41:42.160 --> 41:47.840]  cell phones having a baby carriage with a baby it says watch priest watch pastors
[41:47.840 --> 41:53.520]  watch veterans watch people in military uniform don't trust anyone
[41:53.520 --> 41:58.080]  everyone's basically a terrorist don't trust gun owners don't trust people with
[41:58.080 --> 42:04.120]  anti-un stickers don't trust people with NRA stickers and then I have inside the
[42:04.120 --> 42:09.240]  LAPD from the Discovery Channel from like 1998 where this veteran this World
[42:09.240 --> 42:15.720]  War two vet he was a Korean War vet had died of a heart attack he was found dead
[42:15.720 --> 42:20.480]  three days later by his neighbors they wondered where he was they go in he's
[42:20.480 --> 42:25.120]  dead on the floor the cops come in make fun of his dead body make fun of his
[42:25.120 --> 42:29.440]  metals and stuff and then they come outside make fun of his Bronco the NRA
[42:29.440 --> 42:33.800]  sticker and then they openly steal his guns and brag I'm taking this one I'm
[42:33.800 --> 42:38.640]  taking that one and I mean they're so criminal they think it's normal to steal
[42:38.640 --> 42:43.240]  his guns on camera but and then to talk about how to make fun of his dead
[42:43.240 --> 42:48.240]  stinking body and talk about how he's scum because he owns guns well you know
[42:48.240 --> 42:53.600]  me Alex I'm up here in a up up there in a strip to your AK Chicago so you know
[42:53.600 --> 42:58.160]  that corrupt cops are just you know it's the norm around here and they're
[42:58.160 --> 43:03.000]  already pulling terror stuff up here I mean I lived here for six years I'm not
[43:03.000 --> 43:08.520]  from here originally but I lived here for about six about five six years and I
[43:08.520 --> 43:16.520]  know the patterns of the murder up here usually it's the first warm weekend the
[43:16.520 --> 43:22.120]  spring is usually a big grip of murders and then after that it just it's back
[43:22.120 --> 43:27.400]  to whatever but it just seems lately as the gangbangers all kill each other
[43:27.400 --> 43:31.200]  then they want to disarm or the citizens which makes every gangbanger and
[43:31.200 --> 43:35.000]  crook in the country moved to Chicago the happy hunting land of disarmed
[43:35.000 --> 43:40.640]  slaves oh absolutely it and they really are people here are terrified of a gun
[43:40.640 --> 43:47.360]  yeah I mean you know they're terrified of what it is to be an American absolutely
[43:47.360 --> 43:52.640]  my boy's 11 years old he just took his first shooting lessons he's been raised
[43:52.640 --> 43:56.280]  here all his life you know but I mean he ain't afraid of his gun but his mother
[43:56.280 --> 44:01.640]  is his dad is it's just really you know well the deal is we've got up we've got
[44:01.640 --> 44:05.760]  to take the culture back and that's what's so good about front sight and
[44:05.760 --> 44:09.880]  apple seed and all the other groups everywhere our second amendment culture
[44:09.880 --> 44:13.480]  is winning I appreciate your call I mean I can be out in Hollywood with former
[44:13.480 --> 44:16.960]  Hollywood liberals and they're all pro-second amendment now I can be at a
[44:16.960 --> 44:20.880]  beatnik coffee shop and there's a pro-second amendment people get it
[44:20.880 --> 44:28.400]  Hitler was for gun control Stalin was for gun control Mao Zedong was for gun
[44:28.400 --> 44:32.520]  control because he said political power goes out of the barrel of a gun so do
[44:32.520 --> 44:39.280]  you think the mob boss hereditary dictatorship of the daily clan I mean do
[44:39.280 --> 44:47.440]  you really think that the Irish slash Italian mafia that runs Illinois not
[44:47.440 --> 44:54.680]  bashing Irish folks I'm part Irish the power Italians it's just a fact there
[44:54.680 --> 44:59.640]  is a Jewish mafia there is a wasp mafia there is an Irish mafia and you better
[44:59.640 --> 45:04.200]  know the dailies are big fat mobsters and do you think a gangster wants his
[45:04.200 --> 45:11.640]  horse his slaves armed no first thing a crook does when they come in to rob a
[45:11.640 --> 45:15.640]  bank or rob a liquor store as they say hands up you got a gun in here and they
[45:15.640 --> 45:18.160]  take the gun out from under the counter and they stick it in their belt and they
[45:18.160 --> 45:21.680]  go ahead and give you a pistol whipping the head to get you to submit get on the
[45:21.680 --> 45:27.880]  ground bam I'm here to let you know I run things here and just like North
[45:27.880 --> 45:36.040]  Korea is now three generations deep of dictators so is Illinois with the mafia
[45:36.040 --> 45:42.440]  that runs it there's good people in Illinois there's good people in the
[45:42.440 --> 45:47.800]  rural areas and they're getting sick of it too you got a corrupt organized crime
[45:47.800 --> 45:51.800]  government up there but we got one here I mean I'm not saying it's every police
[45:51.800 --> 45:57.480]  department but I've I've said half it's probably less but a lot of these small
[45:57.480 --> 46:03.440]  towns they just pull you over and they take your wallet and take your watch
[46:03.440 --> 46:07.440]  and take your car and they put you in jail for a week with no charges until
[46:07.440 --> 46:11.880]  you sign forms agreeing to not ever go after them which is a fraud itself but
[46:11.880 --> 46:18.000]  people don't know that and it's it's admitted I mean Dallas and Houston are
[46:18.000 --> 46:23.240]  mafia run the Dallas police on record pull nice cars over throw a bag of chalk
[46:23.240 --> 46:26.520]  in the back and take your car then they go to your house and take your house
[46:26.520 --> 46:36.560]  it's mafia and the the the government is converting to full criminal system
[46:36.560 --> 46:39.600]  right now they're kicking the good people out of government and bringing in
[46:39.600 --> 46:44.040]  the bad right now you see it takes decades and decades and decades for the
[46:44.040 --> 46:48.160]  first few corrupt to get in and then they've got to operate underground they've
[46:48.160 --> 46:52.240]  got to operate secretively but over time they rise up the ranks of government
[46:52.240 --> 46:56.920]  they get into power and folks they're stealing like nothing's left but the
[46:56.920 --> 47:00.120]  smart globalists that are making millions they've all left the country
[47:00.120 --> 47:04.840]  they're in armored compounds in the Cook Islands and in New Zealand and the
[47:04.840 --> 47:11.840]  Caribbean and in the Mediterranean and in Spain and in Switzerland and they are
[47:11.840 --> 47:15.360]  freaked out because they know what they've done they've created a black
[47:15.360 --> 47:19.120]  hole of debt that is going to destroy everything by design and it's going to
[47:19.120 --> 47:22.560]  cause complete breakdown of society which is their plan but they've got to be
[47:22.560 --> 47:27.760]  offshore while it happens all of us we don't have that money there's no where
[47:27.760 --> 47:33.360]  for us to go the least we can do is expose these bastards and point out
[47:33.360 --> 47:36.840]  they're the culprits so as we go through this crisis we have a chance of
[47:36.840 --> 47:42.920]  getting them off our back they plan to ride this out and ride the tiger and

[48:16.400 --> 48:19.920]  safe to their private security islands they remain willfully ignorant to the
[48:19.920 --> 48:23.400]  fact that they will be the first ones taken out by the higher cycle path if
[48:23.400 --> 48:26.800]  the New World Order comes to fruition of course they will be taken out because
[48:26.800 --> 48:31.120]  they have the they have the fool with the ordinary microchip slaves the rest of

[50:08.560 --> 50:14.080]  we understand the term plutocracy Puyko is the Roman counterpart to Hades and
[50:14.080 --> 50:20.240]  the word Hades in Greek is where we get translated as the word hell so
[50:20.240 --> 50:25.680]  literally strictly speaking plutocracy means the rule of hell yes the rule of

[1:21:00.720 --> 1:21:06.720]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[1:21:06.720 --> 1:21:14.720]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[1:21:14.720 --> 1:21:22.720]  Is this a flaw for enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[1:21:22.720 --> 1:21:28.720]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[1:21:28.720 --> 1:21:38.720]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[1:21:38.720 --> 1:21:48.720]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book. Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[1:21:48.720 --> 1:22:00.720]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system. Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:06.720]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:22:06.720 --> 1:22:12.720]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[1:22:12.720 --> 1:22:18.720]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[1:22:18.720 --> 1:22:23.720]  Well, Obama's already fudging. He's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:22:23.720 --> 1:22:36.720]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:46.720]  It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[1:22:46.720 --> 1:22:58.720]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[1:22:58.720 --> 1:23:06.720]  You worry. If you don't, you don't understand the situation. Hi, summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[1:23:06.720 --> 1:23:13.720]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve. Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[1:23:13.720 --> 1:23:18.720]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it. Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:24.720]  Her wild food knowledge package is the Crash Course. The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[1:23:24.720 --> 1:23:32.720]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need, and her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[1:23:32.720 --> 1:23:39.720]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[1:23:39.720 --> 1:23:43.720]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal. She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[1:23:43.720 --> 1:23:50.720]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE. Start now. Knowledge is power.
[1:23:50.720 --> 1:23:54.720]  Better take action. I think a storm's coming.
[1:24:20.720 --> 1:24:38.720]  Yeah, the feds know when they try to set up checkpoints and round people up at them. People are just going to say, look, that's it. The guns come out.
[1:24:38.720 --> 1:24:45.720]  And I guess freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose. And nothing. Nothing if we ain't free.
[1:24:45.720 --> 1:24:54.720]  But we need to avoid that at all costs. But at the same time, we can't go to forced labor camps. The FEMA camps, like Michael Savage was saying, they do plan to arrest us and round us up.
[1:24:54.720 --> 1:25:07.720]  And they did plan to ban the First Amendment. They passed that through the House. I guess that's the one big thing they have gotten passed. Looks like the Senate's going to vote on it.
[1:25:07.720 --> 1:25:17.720]  I've got popping back in. Ted Pike tomorrow, Reverend. Let's go back to your calls here. Who's up next?
[1:25:17.720 --> 1:25:20.720]  Kenny in Virginia? Yeah.
[1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:22.720]  Kenny, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:25:22.720 --> 1:25:28.720]  Yeah, I want to bring attention to the 27th of July that's coming up. It fits in with everything you're saying.
[1:25:28.720 --> 1:25:39.720]  I'm here in Virginia. And last night, they just closed 18 rest areas temporarily, which would make excellent checkpoints. I'm actually from Ohio.
[1:25:39.720 --> 1:25:44.720]  My congressman up there, Jim Traffic, has been in prison for eight years for speaking his mind on the law.
[1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:48.720]  Or they could be doing something like painting stripes at the rest area.
[1:25:48.720 --> 1:25:59.720]  It's for the budget reasons. The state has shut them down to save $9 million. They can't afford to operate them for the next few months or weeks. It's like a big issue up here.
[1:25:59.720 --> 1:26:09.720]  Yeah, what they're doing is they start shutting down national parks and rest areas to create the illusion they're out of money so people will then pay the higher taxes.
[1:26:09.720 --> 1:26:19.720]  And when $23.7 trillion went to foreign banks, that's double the money and $5 billion extra. That's double the money.
[1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:31.720]  $9.4 is at $9.5 trillion, according to Bloomberg, would have paid off all, all. That's all mortgages in the country, not just the ones in trouble.
[1:26:31.720 --> 1:26:46.720]  But double that and $5 billion extra. Double that. And they're lending less. So this is just an absolute financial coup d'état.
[1:26:46.720 --> 1:26:53.720]  They're stealing money even faster than I thought. But see, now the states are going to go bankrupt to the feds and everything's going to go bankrupt.
[1:26:53.720 --> 1:26:57.720]  Only the bankers will be there flush with the tens of trillions. Go ahead.
[1:26:57.720 --> 1:27:04.720]  You think this is going to go next Monday, as far as do you think it's true that there's going to be foreign troops on our soil?
[1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:08.720]  What are you talking about the 27th? I mean, is somebody putting out...
[1:27:08.720 --> 1:27:14.720]  The 27th, the big FEMA exercise, the big, what do they call it, an exercise they're going to be doing from the 27th?
[1:27:14.720 --> 1:27:17.720]  They're talking about the national level exercise.
[1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:24.720]  Exactly. What do you think that's going to be? That's the FEMA, that's their exercise they're going to be doing next week.
[1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:28.720]  And it's kind of strange that it's going to end on the 31st.
[1:27:28.720 --> 1:27:35.720]  I have a vision or a belief that Rex 84 is going to come into effect after next week.
[1:27:35.720 --> 1:27:40.720]  I think Obama's going to get everything he wants. I think they're just going to, when the Congress is in recess,
[1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:45.720]  I just kind of think they're going to shut the government down next week after this big three-day...
[1:27:45.720 --> 1:27:50.720]  See, I was a trucker for 20 years, so I understand three-day exercises by the federal government.
[1:27:50.720 --> 1:27:54.720]  They're going to be in every rest area, checking every truck, anybody going up the road?
[1:27:54.720 --> 1:27:57.720]  It's just like a DUI checkpoint they do already.
[1:27:57.720 --> 1:28:04.720]  Oh, I know about that. No, from California to Tennessee, the regular army shows up and just shuts the highway down,
[1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:09.720]  and they got police dogs out there searching, and the governor in Tennessee said, don't do it.
[1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:14.720]  And they said, you know what? Sit down and shut up, punk. And that was in the newspaper I had a state rep on.
[1:28:14.720 --> 1:28:17.720]  They just said, no, we're going to do it. We don't care what the governor says.
[1:28:17.720 --> 1:28:23.720]  So, you know what's scary about what you're saying is that we have to entertain what you're saying,
[1:28:23.720 --> 1:28:30.720]  because things are so out of control. It was last October that the House and Senate were threatened with martial law.
[1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:35.720]  We broke that here. We had congressmen on the show to talk about it.
[1:28:35.720 --> 1:28:41.720]  People laughed at us, and then now it's been back in the news the last two weeks, but the news has been saying,
[1:28:41.720 --> 1:28:50.720]  oh, it was good that we almost had martial law, and former Treasury Secretary Paulson gave a speech in his hearing last week
[1:28:50.720 --> 1:28:56.720]  admitting that it was for our own good. And so, yes, they are certainly getting everybody ready for that,
[1:28:56.720 --> 1:29:06.720]  and they are having the NLE 2009 with FEMA, 35 federal agencies, and 14 foreign countries.
[1:29:06.720 --> 1:29:13.720]  This is on FEMA's website. Just Google National Level Exercise 2009. You'll be at FEMA.gov.
[1:29:13.720 --> 1:29:18.720]  And so you're saying, will there be foreign troops out? Yes. And select locales.
[1:29:18.720 --> 1:29:21.720]  And what they do is they have local cops come over, pull the citizens over.
[1:29:21.720 --> 1:29:26.720]  Then the federal troops come over, and then they even let the foreign troops kind of have a little fun with the slaves.
[1:29:26.720 --> 1:29:28.720]  But it's the same thing in England.
[1:29:28.720 --> 1:29:36.720]  The BBC reports Ukrainian troops are setting up checkpoints in Scotland slapping around the slaves.
[1:29:36.720 --> 1:29:44.720]  And it'll certainly be a good drill teaching us how to have our families broken up and how to be put in different trucks
[1:29:44.720 --> 1:29:48.720]  and how to have the feds take over and how to tell governors to sit down and shut up.
[1:29:48.720 --> 1:29:50.720]  But who knows, it'll be the big one.
[1:29:50.720 --> 1:29:58.720]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:58.720 --> 1:30:00.720]  Oh, yeah, baby.
[1:30:00.720 --> 1:30:06.720]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the Truth Movement for years.
[1:30:06.720 --> 1:30:11.720]  Inner Health Botanicals. This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[1:30:11.720 --> 1:30:13.720]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[1:30:13.720 --> 1:30:20.720]  And now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editors' Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[1:30:20.720 --> 1:30:25.720]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients. No fillers, no sweeteners.
[1:30:25.720 --> 1:30:30.720]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price, and their formula really works.
[1:30:30.720 --> 1:30:34.720]  This is the real thing for the great health you need. Try the Nutra Cafe.
[1:30:34.720 --> 1:30:39.720]  They're great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[1:30:39.720 --> 1:30:44.720]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great. And take it from me, folks. It really does taste great.
[1:30:44.720 --> 1:30:46.720]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[1:30:46.720 --> 1:30:56.720]  Go to www.enerfod.com. That's www.enerfod.com.
[1:30:56.720 --> 1:31:00.720]  Or just click on their banner on infowars.com for special pricing.
[1:31:00.720 --> 1:31:05.720]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[1:31:05.720 --> 1:31:09.720]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:31:09.720 --> 1:31:15.720]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[1:31:15.720 --> 1:31:20.720]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:31:20.720 --> 1:31:24.720]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[1:31:24.720 --> 1:31:27.720]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[1:31:27.720 --> 1:31:30.720]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[1:31:30.720 --> 1:31:34.720]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[1:31:34.720 --> 1:31:39.720]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:31:39.720 --> 1:31:43.720]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:31:43.720 --> 1:31:45.720]  a long time sponsor of ours.
[1:31:45.720 --> 1:31:51.720]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[1:32:05.720 --> 1:32:07.720]  Take a deep breath.
[1:32:07.720 --> 1:32:14.720]  Can you actually feel the airborne influenza, viruses, mold, bacteria and dangerous ozone entering your lungs?
[1:32:14.720 --> 1:32:15.720]  Have a glass of water.
[1:32:15.720 --> 1:32:21.720]  Can you taste the harmful chlorine, fluoride, lead, pharmaceutical drugs and numerous other chemicals?
[1:32:21.720 --> 1:32:22.720]  Of course you can't.
[1:32:22.720 --> 1:32:27.720]  The air that you breathe and the water you drink should help maintain good health, not take away from it.

[1:33:52.720 --> 1:34:17.720]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, more of your calls coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[1:34:17.720 --> 1:34:19.720]  Man, that's why I love taking calls.
[1:34:19.720 --> 1:34:22.720]  Each one of these calls brings up another huge issue.
[1:34:22.720 --> 1:34:29.720]  I mean, I've been reporting for three, four months about National Level Exercise 09, NLE 09,
[1:34:29.720 --> 1:34:35.720]  openly drilling for martial law, openly drilling with 14 different nations.
[1:34:35.720 --> 1:34:40.720]  What four of them are physically going to have troops on the ground in the U.S. according to FEMA?
[1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:43.720]  And FEMA always lies, I'm sure there'll be more than that.
[1:34:43.720 --> 1:34:48.720]  And I've been to other top-off drills, and that's what these were called previously,
[1:34:48.720 --> 1:34:53.720]  and they had one in Denver in 2000,
[1:34:53.720 --> 1:34:57.720]  and they practiced putting the local citizens in the sports stadium.
[1:34:57.720 --> 1:35:00.720]  People always ask, where's the FEMA camp?
[1:35:00.720 --> 1:35:03.720]  So, local sports stadium is designated.
[1:35:03.720 --> 1:35:07.720]  Local shopping mall is designated, and that's just on record.
[1:35:07.720 --> 1:35:09.720]  But then they have the other military bases and other facilities,
[1:35:09.720 --> 1:35:12.720]  and we told you how they would sell the camps,
[1:35:12.720 --> 1:35:15.720]  how they would advertise as a humanitarian aid center,
[1:35:15.720 --> 1:35:21.720]  where you want to go and mobile government vans and for medical care and how...
[1:35:21.720 --> 1:35:24.720]  But you've got to be frisked when you go in the camp,
[1:35:24.720 --> 1:35:27.720]  and the men live in one area, and the women in the other, and the children in another,
[1:35:27.720 --> 1:35:30.720]  and then CPS goes ahead and takes your kids,
[1:35:30.720 --> 1:35:32.720]  because you can't be destitute in living in a camp,
[1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:36.720]  and now it's happening in Hawaii, and New York, and Michigan, and Florida,
[1:35:36.720 --> 1:35:39.720]  because it's been done over and over again.
[1:35:39.720 --> 1:35:48.720]  By the way, I've got three separate news articles from AP Fox News and the New York Post.
[1:35:48.720 --> 1:35:52.720]  Fox News, Dr. Mark Siegel on rationing care.
[1:35:52.720 --> 1:35:54.720]  We're going to play this clip later.
[1:35:54.720 --> 1:36:00.720]  In a way, it's a form of eugenics, he says,
[1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:04.720]  and he is going to leave the American Medical Association,
[1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:09.720]  and that's what it is, that's what the bioethicist boards are.
[1:36:09.720 --> 1:36:13.720]  And I've talked to bioethicist doctors.
[1:36:13.720 --> 1:36:19.720]  I was talking to a bioethicist doctor this weekend about bioethics,
[1:36:19.720 --> 1:36:23.720]  and he said, no, I've even worked in bioethics and been on some of the boards,
[1:36:23.720 --> 1:36:25.720]  but never really realized you were right,
[1:36:25.720 --> 1:36:29.720]  and he said he'd seen Endgame and went and did some research off of Endgame
[1:36:29.720 --> 1:36:32.720]  and found out the bioethicist movement was set up in the 50s
[1:36:32.720 --> 1:36:34.720]  after the eugenicist had been exposed,
[1:36:34.720 --> 1:36:37.720]  because the board decides if you live,
[1:36:37.720 --> 1:36:40.720]  they decide if you get a liver, they decide if you get a kidney,
[1:36:40.720 --> 1:36:43.720]  they decide, and what is Tom Daschle saying in his book,
[1:36:43.720 --> 1:36:46.720]  you're above sexy, you don't get a nice surgery.
[1:36:46.720 --> 1:36:49.720]  It's not Republican saying this about rationing care.
[1:36:49.720 --> 1:36:54.720]  This is not some political made-up football that they're batting around.
[1:36:54.720 --> 1:36:57.720]  This is real.
[1:36:57.720 --> 1:37:02.720]  That's coming up. I want to get into Walter Cronkite clip that I mean to play,
[1:37:02.720 --> 1:37:05.720]  well, I was out of town when he died, but I didn't mean to play it yesterday.
[1:37:05.720 --> 1:37:08.720]  So we're going to play that, and then continue blitzing through your phone calls
[1:37:08.720 --> 1:37:11.720]  through this hour and the next,
[1:37:11.720 --> 1:37:14.720]  and then Gerald Salente joins us in the fourth hour today,
[1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:17.720]  always informative and would have a lot of important questions for him,
[1:37:17.720 --> 1:37:19.720]  but before I do that,
[1:37:19.720 --> 1:37:25.720]  I wanted to go over a few of the sponsors that make today's transmission possible,
[1:37:25.720 --> 1:37:28.720]  and I only take sponsors that I firmly believe in
[1:37:28.720 --> 1:37:30.720]  and that I believe are the best in the business,
[1:37:30.720 --> 1:37:33.720]  and the food company we endorse and promote
[1:37:33.720 --> 1:37:37.720]  is the place I got my storeable foods two separate times,
[1:37:37.720 --> 1:37:41.720]  because I got some earlier and they had MSG in them,
[1:37:41.720 --> 1:37:45.720]  or it was mainly soybean filler, or it was GMO.
[1:37:45.720 --> 1:37:48.720]  Well, a lot higher quality, no GMO,
[1:37:48.720 --> 1:37:52.720]  no monosodium glutamate in this stuff,
[1:37:52.720 --> 1:37:56.720]  and it's all packaged monthly at their own factory,
[1:37:56.720 --> 1:38:00.720]  all grown in the United States, non-GMO, non-hybrid,
[1:38:00.720 --> 1:38:07.720]  but they're, what do you call them, bananas.
[1:38:07.720 --> 1:38:09.720]  Those are grown, I think in Guatemala,
[1:38:09.720 --> 1:38:11.720]  and they're the organic type as well,
[1:38:11.720 --> 1:38:13.720]  but that is not grown in the U.S., only thing that isn't.
[1:38:13.720 --> 1:38:17.720]  So eFoodsDirect.com, the letter E, foodsdirect.com.
[1:38:17.720 --> 1:38:20.720]  In these crazy times, it's insane to not have storeable foods,
[1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:22.720]  it's insane to not be prepared.
[1:38:22.720 --> 1:38:26.720]  eFoodsDirect.com or 1-800-409-5633,
[1:38:26.720 --> 1:38:28.720]  1-800-409-5633.

[1:39:09.720 --> 1:39:11.720]  where you can look at the house at street level
[1:39:11.720 --> 1:39:14.720]  and take a virtual walk through the neighborhood you're interested in.

[1:39:51.720 --> 1:39:53.720]  Okay, and then lastly,
[1:39:53.720 --> 1:39:56.720]  I just want to encourage everybody to visit infowars.com

[1:40:05.720 --> 1:40:08.720]  the Creme de la Creme.
[1:40:08.720 --> 1:40:12.720]  It is all available.
[1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:17.720]  All available at infowars.com.

[1:40:27.720 --> 1:40:30.720]  We've got, okay, Aaron Russo documentary I made,
[1:40:30.720 --> 1:40:32.720]  the expanded interview.
[1:40:32.720 --> 1:40:35.720]  I never released the whole thing in my own up-to-date info,
[1:40:35.720 --> 1:40:38.720]  about 10 minutes of me in the film and some documents and other clips.
[1:40:38.720 --> 1:40:40.720]  It's a really well done. People requested it.
[1:40:40.720 --> 1:40:46.720]  It's free. Free at infowars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[1:40:46.720 --> 1:40:50.720]  Free when you get the Obama deception or free when you get in-game.
[1:40:50.720 --> 1:40:52.720]  A bunch of different specials, a bunch of different,
[1:40:52.720 --> 1:40:55.720]  I don't know, we got like, I haven't counted 30, 40, 50 different specials,
[1:40:55.720 --> 1:40:59.720]  I don't know, combo deals, just to get the DVDs, the books,
[1:40:59.720 --> 1:41:03.720]  the materials out, make copies of them, get them out to everybody.
[1:41:03.720 --> 1:41:05.720]  And I love Aaron. He was a great guy.
[1:41:05.720 --> 1:41:07.720]  He died shortly after cancer.
[1:41:07.720 --> 1:41:09.720]  It's his last videotape interview.
[1:41:09.720 --> 1:41:14.720]  888-253-3139. You can also write to me, Alex Jones,
[1:41:14.720 --> 1:41:22.720]  at 3001-South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[1:41:22.720 --> 1:41:27.720]  Okay, that said, I played a clip earlier of Hillary Clinton last hour,
[1:41:27.720 --> 1:41:32.720]  thanking Walter Cronkite for all his work for world government.
[1:41:32.720 --> 1:41:34.720]  And Walter Cronkite stands up and says,
[1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:38.720]  yes, only a world government will save us and bring world peace and the rest of it.
[1:41:38.720 --> 1:41:42.720]  But meanwhile, the proponents of world government are a bunch of murdering eugenicists.
[1:41:42.720 --> 1:41:44.720]  They want to have world governments so they can orderly exterminate us.
[1:41:44.720 --> 1:41:46.720]  I've told you that for a decade.
[1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:49.720]  Since I read the Biological Diversity Assessment in 96,
[1:41:49.720 --> 1:41:52.720]  so I guess more than a decade, I found that in 97.
[1:41:52.720 --> 1:41:57.720]  State Department of Random 200, I read that in 96, declassified in 92.
[1:41:57.720 --> 1:42:00.720]  And the hundreds of other documents, we sourced them all in in-game.
[1:42:00.720 --> 1:42:09.720]  We have the White House Science Tsar writing an 1,100-page death treatise
[1:42:09.720 --> 1:42:12.720]  where he talks about a world government, the CPS,
[1:42:12.720 --> 1:42:16.720]  to take everyone's children at birth, sterilizes, poison the water and food.
[1:42:16.720 --> 1:42:19.720]  I mean, this is a murder game.
[1:42:19.720 --> 1:42:21.720]  And I just played that clip.
[1:42:21.720 --> 1:42:25.720]  Well, here he is making jokes about being at the right hand of Satan.
[1:42:25.720 --> 1:42:28.720]  And after we're done with that, I want to play the little vignette, John.
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:31.720]  You put together with Cronkite saying the same thing.
[1:42:31.720 --> 1:42:33.720]  Here it is.
[1:42:33.720 --> 1:42:35.720]  Well, join me.
[1:42:35.720 --> 1:42:39.720]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[1:42:39.720 --> 1:42:44.720]  Let us hear the appeal of a new international Liberty Bell
[1:42:44.720 --> 1:42:49.720]  that calls us all to the creation of a system of enforceable world law
[1:42:49.720 --> 1:42:56.720]  in which the universal desire for peace can face its hopes and its prayers.
[1:42:56.720 --> 1:43:02.720]  Thank you.
[1:43:02.720 --> 1:43:06.720]  We would like to bring you a message from the First Lady.
[1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:11.720]  Better stop from the beginning.
[1:43:11.720 --> 1:43:14.720]  Perhaps you would better stop from the beginning.
[1:43:14.720 --> 1:43:16.720]  And when everybody is listening to me very carefully,
[1:43:16.720 --> 1:43:18.720]  perhaps you would better stop from the beginning.
[1:43:18.720 --> 1:43:21.720]  They do plan on killing each and every one of us.
[1:43:21.720 --> 1:43:25.720]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[1:43:25.720 --> 1:43:27.720]  All these kids come from bad gene pools.
[1:43:27.720 --> 1:43:32.720]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[1:43:32.720 --> 1:43:35.720]  Military containing vaccines may help not harm kids
[1:43:35.720 --> 1:43:38.720]  according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:40.720]  These new studies suggest that the opposite,
[1:43:40.720 --> 1:43:44.720]  that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior
[1:43:44.720 --> 1:43:45.720]  and mental performance.
[1:43:45.720 --> 1:43:48.720]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay,
[1:43:48.720 --> 1:43:50.720]  but could it also cause cancer?
[1:43:50.720 --> 1:43:55.720]  Now the government has the right under U.S. law to conduct secret testing
[1:43:55.720 --> 1:43:57.720]  on the American public under a specific condition.
[1:43:57.720 --> 1:43:59.720]  We have to work the dark side of it.
[1:43:59.720 --> 1:44:01.720]  We'll spend time in the shadows.
[1:44:01.720 --> 1:44:05.720]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[1:44:05.720 --> 1:44:06.720]  Well, join me.
[1:44:06.720 --> 1:44:09.720]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand to see.
[1:44:09.720 --> 1:44:12.720]  There's a need for a new world order.
[1:44:12.720 --> 1:44:17.720]  Someday, in the next few years,
[1:44:17.720 --> 1:44:23.720]  a solution will emerge.
[1:44:23.720 --> 1:44:27.720]  We are now entering the new world order.
[1:44:27.720 --> 1:44:33.720]  You're now in the zone of the triangulated fire of state crises.
[1:44:33.720 --> 1:44:35.720]  Many of you are doubting me now,
[1:44:35.720 --> 1:44:38.720]  but down the road you'll remember what I said,
[1:44:38.720 --> 1:44:43.720]  and then you will activate, you will resist,
[1:44:43.720 --> 1:44:50.720]  you will defend the species.
[1:44:50.720 --> 1:44:53.720]  They're only alive once,
[1:44:53.720 --> 1:44:58.720]  but you live forever through the species.
[1:44:58.720 --> 1:45:00.720]  You can physically fall,
[1:45:00.720 --> 1:45:02.720]  and it doesn't matter,
[1:45:02.720 --> 1:45:05.720]  but if the species is overtaken and damaged by these people,
[1:45:05.720 --> 1:45:07.720]  we all fall.
[1:45:07.720 --> 1:45:11.720]  You know when you're gotten your DNA on right,
[1:45:11.720 --> 1:45:14.720]  and I say arise humanity.
[1:45:14.720 --> 1:45:17.720]  Arise to tyranny.
[1:45:17.720 --> 1:45:20.720]  Activate the survival mechanism.
[1:45:20.720 --> 1:45:22.720]  Resist the enemy.
[1:45:22.720 --> 1:45:24.720]  Break your conditioning.
[1:45:24.720 --> 1:45:27.720]  Stand up against the globalists.
[1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:29.720]  Don't let them control the future
[1:45:29.720 --> 1:45:32.720]  and dominate human society.
[1:45:32.720 --> 1:45:36.720]  Don't let them control your destiny.
[1:45:36.720 --> 1:45:39.720]  Let's go to your phone calls here.
[1:45:39.720 --> 1:45:42.720]  Hello, Dave in New York.
[1:45:42.720 --> 1:45:44.720]  You're on the air, Dave.
[1:45:44.720 --> 1:45:46.720]  Hey, Alex.
[1:45:46.720 --> 1:45:48.720]  Hey, buddy.
[1:45:48.720 --> 1:45:50.720]  Nice to talk to you, Dave.
[1:45:50.720 --> 1:45:53.720]  I heard on a show last week
[1:45:53.720 --> 1:45:57.720]  that part of the GPSing through the census people taking
[1:45:57.720 --> 1:46:01.720]  is part of the cap and trade and carbon tax.
[1:46:01.720 --> 1:46:07.720]  They're going to track you in your car from your home port,
[1:46:07.720 --> 1:46:11.720]  and they're going to bill you or calculate your tax credits
[1:46:11.720 --> 1:46:13.720]  from your mileage.
[1:46:13.720 --> 1:46:17.720]  So I guess the intention was to get all these GPSs in the car.
[1:46:17.720 --> 1:46:19.720]  I wouldn't be surprised if before I wanted to make it a law
[1:46:19.720 --> 1:46:21.720]  to put it even in your old car.
[1:46:21.720 --> 1:46:23.720]  No, that's why the on-star and the other companies
[1:46:23.720 --> 1:46:26.720]  are all GPS triangulated,
[1:46:26.720 --> 1:46:29.720]  or GPS trackers, all cell phones by law
[1:46:29.720 --> 1:46:31.720]  in the 1996 Telecommunications Act
[1:46:31.720 --> 1:46:33.720]  that put in all the snoop-ups.
[1:46:33.720 --> 1:46:35.720]  By October 1, 2001,
[1:46:35.720 --> 1:46:37.720]  the satellite coordinate track,
[1:46:37.720 --> 1:46:39.720]  they're not GPS themselves,
[1:46:39.720 --> 1:46:41.720]  but the cell towers are,
[1:46:41.720 --> 1:46:43.720]  and the actual patents are in,
[1:46:43.720 --> 1:46:46.720]  they're going to tax you mile to mile by your cell phone.
[1:46:46.720 --> 1:46:49.720]  And I remember when I first got on air 14 years ago,
[1:46:49.720 --> 1:46:52.720]  I was sent all these publications by local engineers
[1:46:52.720 --> 1:46:54.720]  about the federal plan to tax us by the mile.
[1:46:54.720 --> 1:46:58.720]  Then 10 years ago, England and Germany started putting it in,
[1:46:58.720 --> 1:47:00.720]  and then now the feds have announced
[1:47:00.720 --> 1:47:03.720]  his transportation secretary said this is the next phase,
[1:47:03.720 --> 1:47:05.720]  and then when we say we don't want it,
[1:47:05.720 --> 1:47:07.720]  they laugh and say it doesn't exist.
[1:47:07.720 --> 1:47:09.720]  But now it's all over the news.
[1:47:09.720 --> 1:47:13.720]  It's going to cost $165
[1:47:13.720 --> 1:47:16.720]  to travel from Austin to Dallas and back.
[1:47:16.720 --> 1:47:19.720]  That's the feds own numbers.
[1:47:19.720 --> 1:47:21.720]  There's no level of raping they're not going to give us,
[1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:23.720]  and it's all going to go to bankers.
[1:47:23.720 --> 1:47:24.720]  And if you don't like it,
[1:47:24.720 --> 1:47:27.720]  paramilitary forces are going to gun you down.
[1:47:27.720 --> 1:47:29.720]  You try not paying the tracker tax.
[1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:31.720]  The cops are going to pull you over,
[1:47:31.720 --> 1:47:34.720]  and if you resist, they're going to murder you.
[1:47:34.720 --> 1:47:37.720]  And see, when I make the point that we're living in tyranny,
[1:47:37.720 --> 1:47:40.720]  is that not tyranny, Bubba?
[1:47:40.720 --> 1:47:43.720]  And as the economy declines,
[1:47:43.720 --> 1:47:45.720]  it's going to get worse and worse
[1:47:45.720 --> 1:47:47.720]  because they're going to need the tax revenue
[1:47:47.720 --> 1:47:49.720]  even more severely and more severely.
[1:47:49.720 --> 1:47:51.720]  It's about breaking your back.
[1:47:51.720 --> 1:47:54.720]  It's about driving you into submission.
[1:47:54.720 --> 1:47:57.720]  Right, and we have to be kept in a perpetual state of anxiety.
[1:47:57.720 --> 1:48:00.720]  I mean, they learn that from advertising.
[1:48:00.720 --> 1:48:03.720]  Advertising keeps us in a perpetual state of anxiety.
[1:48:03.720 --> 1:48:06.720]  If you weren't anxious about something you see on a commercial or TV,
[1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:08.720]  you wouldn't buy it.
[1:48:08.720 --> 1:48:10.720]  So, I mean, they know that technique.
[1:48:10.720 --> 1:48:13.720]  They have to keep us in a perpetual state of anxiety,
[1:48:13.720 --> 1:48:15.720]  and this science is going on.
[1:48:15.720 --> 1:48:16.720]  And they don't need the money.
[1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:17.720]  They don't need the money.
[1:48:17.720 --> 1:48:20.720]  More than half the federal money goes to interest on the debt,
[1:48:20.720 --> 1:48:21.720]  and that was last year's number.
[1:48:21.720 --> 1:48:26.720]  Now, with 23.7 trillion in 10 months,
[1:48:26.720 --> 1:48:28.720]  everything's going to go to the debt,
[1:48:28.720 --> 1:48:29.720]  just like a third world country.
[1:48:29.720 --> 1:48:32.720]  And they're going to squeeze everything out of you,
[1:48:32.720 --> 1:48:34.720]  and then they're going to bankrupt you and then say,
[1:48:34.720 --> 1:48:36.720]  we'll give you money and welfare,
[1:48:36.720 --> 1:48:38.720]  but you got to get your tubes tied.
[1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:43.720]  Everything will be overseen by the control freak degenerate eugenics.
[1:48:43.720 --> 1:48:44.720]  Everything.
[1:48:44.720 --> 1:48:46.720]  Total bondage, total rulership.
[1:48:46.720 --> 1:48:48.720]  Your kids will be in black uniforms.
[1:48:48.720 --> 1:48:51.720]  You'll have to kiss your college kids butts when they come home
[1:48:51.720 --> 1:48:53.720]  with their arm patches on.
[1:48:53.720 --> 1:48:54.720]  It's already happening.
[1:48:54.720 --> 1:48:55.720]  I'm already getting reports from parents,
[1:48:55.720 --> 1:48:58.720]  their kids in red and black uniforms with City Year coming home
[1:48:58.720 --> 1:48:59.720]  and bossing them around.
[1:48:59.720 --> 1:49:02.720]  All these do nothing on power trips.
[1:49:02.720 --> 1:49:03.720]  This is hell.
[1:49:03.720 --> 1:49:04.720]  They've done this before.
[1:49:04.720 --> 1:49:06.720]  This is a government of hell.
[1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:08.720]  I'm with you, Alex.
[1:49:08.720 --> 1:49:10.720]  And we love you here in New York and keep up the good work.
[1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:12.720]  We'll keep up our end.
[1:49:12.720 --> 1:49:13.720]  God bless you, sir.
[1:49:13.720 --> 1:49:14.720]  We love you too.
[1:49:14.720 --> 1:49:15.720]  They're my friend.
[1:49:15.720 --> 1:49:16.720]  Good to hear from you, Dave.
[1:49:16.720 --> 1:49:21.720]  I was saying, I'm afraid, Dave, from the Hell 9000 2001 Space Odyssey.
[1:49:21.720 --> 1:49:23.720]  I'm afraid, Dave.
[1:49:23.720 --> 1:49:25.720]  I'm afraid.
[1:49:25.720 --> 1:49:26.720]  All right.
[1:49:26.720 --> 1:49:30.720]  We'll take you out a little bit of music here in the Court of the Crimson King.
[1:49:30.720 --> 1:49:34.720]  And then we will come back and go to Brian, George, Steve and others.
[1:49:34.720 --> 1:49:35.720]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:49:35.720 --> 1:49:36.720]  Get fired up.
[1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:38.720]  Get mad and beat these Soviets.
[1:49:38.720 --> 1:49:41.720]  For sure enough, they're going to have their way with you in the gulags.
[1:49:41.720 --> 1:49:52.720]  It's what they do.
[1:49:52.720 --> 1:49:54.720]  The Court of the Crimson King.
[1:49:54.720 --> 1:49:59.720]  Blood flows.
[1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:06.720]  The rusty chains of prison moons are shattered by the sun.
[1:50:06.720 --> 1:50:13.720]  I walk road, horizons change, the tournaments begun.
[1:50:13.720 --> 1:50:20.720]  The purple pipe uploses tune, the choir softly sing.
[1:50:20.720 --> 1:50:32.720]  We lullabies in an ancient tongue for the Court of the Crimson King.
[1:50:32.720 --> 1:50:37.720]  All the preparation was just beginning.
[1:50:37.720 --> 1:50:43.720]  Everything you've seen, they've gloriously worked to have their way with the American people.
[1:50:43.720 --> 1:50:49.720]  As they did in Germany and Russia and China and Cuba and Cambodia.
[1:50:49.720 --> 1:50:54.720]  Now the control freaks will have their great blood feast.
[1:50:54.720 --> 1:51:01.720]  The keeper of the city keys put shutters on.
[1:51:01.720 --> 1:51:03.720]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[1:51:03.720 --> 1:51:08.720]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[1:51:08.720 --> 1:51:10.720]  But the symptoms are there.
[1:51:10.720 --> 1:51:15.720]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[1:51:15.720 --> 1:51:18.720]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:51:18.720 --> 1:51:24.720]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[1:51:24.720 --> 1:51:28.720]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[1:51:28.720 --> 1:51:33.720]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[1:51:33.720 --> 1:51:35.720]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:51:35.720 --> 1:51:43.720]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[1:51:43.720 --> 1:52:07.720]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:52:07.720 --> 1:52:12.720]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong.
[1:52:12.720 --> 1:52:14.720]  Just as well-funded.
[1:52:14.720 --> 1:52:20.720]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[1:52:20.720 --> 1:52:22.720]  Well Obama's already fudging.
[1:52:22.720 --> 1:52:25.720]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[1:52:25.720 --> 1:52:29.720]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[1:52:29.720 --> 1:52:36.720]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:52:36.720 --> 1:52:40.720]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[1:52:40.720 --> 1:52:47.720]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:54:00.720 --> 1:54:26.720]  PEPPERSPRAY.COM
[1:54:26.720 --> 1:54:32.720]  You can, New World Order, just like you're turning off our society, turning off our energy sources.
[1:54:32.720 --> 1:54:39.720]  You get us in your compact cities, get us all dependent on your fiat currency debt system and you pull the rug out from under us.
[1:54:39.720 --> 1:54:46.720]  I mean, the level of stealing, double the GDP in 10 months.
[1:54:46.720 --> 1:54:57.720]  Double the GDP in what, nine and a half months, you want to get exact, I don't know, what's mid-October to late July.
[1:54:57.720 --> 1:55:03.720]  October, November, December, January, February, March, April, May, June, July.
[1:55:03.720 --> 1:55:06.720]  Yeah, nine and a half months.
[1:55:06.720 --> 1:55:14.720]  Nine and a half months and they've stolen the GDP of the United States two times over.
[1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:28.720]  And then I've got clip after clip after clip after clip after clip after clip after clip after clip of the Congress saying, where's the money?
[1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:30.720]  And they say, will you tell us?
[1:55:30.720 --> 1:55:32.720]  And they go, no.
[1:55:32.720 --> 1:55:35.720]  Will you tell us about the trillions of offshore banks?
[1:55:35.720 --> 1:55:37.720]  No.
[1:55:37.720 --> 1:55:39.720]  Because they are the criminals.
[1:55:39.720 --> 1:55:43.720]  It's a big joke to them.
[1:55:43.720 --> 1:55:46.720]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Texas.
[1:55:46.720 --> 1:55:48.720]  Brian, you're on the air.
[1:55:48.720 --> 1:55:50.720]  Alex, can you hear me?
[1:55:50.720 --> 1:55:52.720]  Yes, sir.
[1:55:52.720 --> 1:55:54.720]  Hey, I've got a complaint.
[1:55:54.720 --> 1:55:57.720]  Just let me hear me out before you blast me.
[1:55:57.720 --> 1:56:04.720]  I want to come at you from a media info war type of perspective.
[1:56:04.720 --> 1:56:13.720]  Well, what I see on the ground, and when I say on the ground, I know you're in the trenches, but I see anecdotal evidence of my kid's friend saying, oh yeah, my dad listened to Alex Johnson.
[1:56:13.720 --> 1:56:21.720]  And I see that the very people that you despise or sometimes insult with terrible language, I see these people coming on board.
[1:56:21.720 --> 1:56:29.720]  And I take a critical moment, is Rush Limbaugh used to mimic you and come towards you in such a way where you're saying the same thing.
[1:56:29.720 --> 1:56:35.720]  And if you alienate these people that are coming on board, he will co-op this message and make it go off track.
[1:56:35.720 --> 1:56:47.720]  And I'm wondering why it seems reckless to me to sort of take that approach where you would, you know, even the Patriot movement itself, referring to it as pathetic and this, that and the other.
[1:56:47.720 --> 1:56:55.720]  Sometimes I think you're so focused, so in the trenches, so frustrated by the horrible things that are going on that maybe you need to...
[1:56:55.720 --> 1:56:59.720]  You're absolutely right, I am a piece of crap.
[1:56:59.720 --> 1:57:03.720]  You're right, I agree with you.
[1:57:03.720 --> 1:57:04.720]  Okay.
[1:57:04.720 --> 1:57:09.720]  That's just, that's just, if I'm not demanding it, but I sure think it would help.
[1:57:09.720 --> 1:57:13.720]  Well, I mean, let me just hold on a second.
[1:57:13.720 --> 1:57:17.720]  We're all pieces of garbage, but we're also all of us wonderful.
[1:57:17.720 --> 1:57:21.720]  We can reach for the heavens, we can also fall into hell.
[1:57:21.720 --> 1:57:31.720]  So certainly, I don't have all the answers and I make a lot of mistakes, but I think if people feel like I'm insulting them when I say yuppies, I don't mean all yuppies, you can call me a yuppie.
[1:57:31.720 --> 1:57:36.720]  I'm an urban, you know, white professional or whatever.
[1:57:36.720 --> 1:57:43.720]  I'm talking about a certain type of yuppie who just doesn't care about anybody, even themselves, and just laugh about everything.
[1:57:43.720 --> 1:57:45.720]  I want to punch him in the nose.
[1:57:45.720 --> 1:57:51.720]  And when I talk about good cops and I talk about bad cops, I know police are waking up.
[1:57:51.720 --> 1:57:55.720]  Believe me, I know, but when I also talk about cops, I'm talking about bad ones.
[1:57:55.720 --> 1:57:56.720]  You know what I mean?
[1:57:56.720 --> 1:57:59.720]  There are cops in Texas robbing people on the side of the highway.
[1:57:59.720 --> 1:58:00.720]  I mean, I don't enjoy that.
[1:58:00.720 --> 1:58:08.720]  Believe me, if I wanted to bash cops, I've got so much ammo, I could cram every second of every show with just new stuff they're doing.
[1:58:08.720 --> 1:58:14.720]  Because there's millions of cops and there's a lot of bad ones.
[1:58:14.720 --> 1:58:21.720]  So I specifically want to hold you over for one minute as we start the third hour and I want you to tell me examples of what I do.
[1:58:21.720 --> 1:58:24.720]  Because God knows I'd do it, man.
[1:58:24.720 --> 1:58:26.720]  You know why, though, we're successful at making folks up?
[1:58:26.720 --> 1:58:27.720]  Because it's real.
[1:58:27.720 --> 1:58:33.720]  I don't care when the New York Times or Wall Street Journal lies about me and attacks me.
[1:58:33.720 --> 1:58:35.720]  I don't care when people attack me on the Internet anymore.
[1:58:35.720 --> 1:58:37.720]  I just don't care.
[1:58:37.720 --> 1:58:40.720]  And stay with me.
[1:58:40.720 --> 1:58:45.720]  You are listening to GCN.
[1:58:45.720 --> 1:59:11.720]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:59:16.720 --> 1:59:23.720]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[1:59:23.720 --> 1:59:29.720]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[2:00:16.720 --> 2:00:26.720]  Go to FrontSight.com today. That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com.
[2:00:47.720 --> 2:00:53.720]  And that if I alienate people, they'll end up just tuning into Rush Limbaugh, who more and more is sounding like me.
[2:00:53.720 --> 2:00:59.720]  And I rarely listen to Limbaugh, but I do hear him talk about the New World Order now and the globalists and now Obama wants a New World Order.
[2:00:59.720 --> 2:01:04.720]  After all these years back when we could stop it, he said none of it existed.
[2:01:04.720 --> 2:01:09.720]  Kind of like Savage saying it didn't exist, and now he says Obama's going to stage terror attacks.
[2:01:09.720 --> 2:01:15.720]  And better late than never, but see the Republicans are out of power right now so they can act like they're against it.
[2:01:15.720 --> 2:01:20.720]  Rick Perry, who's Bilderberg, saying he's for state sovereignty and Texas secession.
[2:01:20.720 --> 2:01:28.720]  Well, he's miscasting what we want. We want state sovereignty, not secession necessarily.
[2:01:28.720 --> 2:01:36.720]  The two aren't the same, declaring state rights under the Tenth Amendment, Ninth and Tenth Amendment.
[2:01:36.720 --> 2:01:39.720]  So yes, I know that I talk about the public as scum.
[2:01:39.720 --> 2:01:46.720]  I mean the people that have had 50 million abortions are 51 million, 52 million, whatever it is now. I hate to pull up 2008.
[2:01:46.720 --> 2:01:48.720]  They weren't a few thousand and nine yet.
[2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:51.720]  Abortion statistics, that's something I need to know. I haven't looked at that in a few years.
[2:01:51.720 --> 2:01:54.720]  It was 50 million like a year ago. We'll see what it is now.
[2:01:54.720 --> 2:02:01.720]  But when I just sit there and call general names, I'm not talking about everybody, obviously.
[2:02:01.720 --> 2:02:07.720]  And I talk about myself having plenty of problems, but specifically, Brian, what is it you think I'm doing wrong?
[2:02:07.720 --> 2:02:09.720]  How can I do better?
[2:02:09.720 --> 2:02:16.720]  I think you can be best described as saying you have the Brett Farr syndrome, in that you do astounding work.
[2:02:16.720 --> 2:02:24.720]  But this group of business owners, 80% of America's business is small business that follow Rush Limbaugh, et cetera, et cetera.
[2:02:24.720 --> 2:02:27.720]  These are people that have ignored and are skeptical of what you say.
[2:02:27.720 --> 2:02:35.720]  But as the purveyor of truth, Alex, you cannot alienate these people with words like prostitutes and we love slavery and we...
[2:02:35.720 --> 2:02:43.720]  What it shows is that you're so in the truck watching the wheels spin that you don't realize that your movement is starting to gain momentum.
[2:02:43.720 --> 2:02:47.720]  And I think you need to quit being the brigade leader and the Brett Farr be the coach.
[2:02:47.720 --> 2:02:55.720]  And start to understand that victory, not so much on the ground with each individual battle, but in terms of the movement itself,
[2:02:55.720 --> 2:02:58.720]  is going to depend upon how thick you can swell this movement.
[2:02:58.720 --> 2:03:06.720]  And if he comes for you and you can co-op that, we won't...
[2:03:06.720 --> 2:03:10.720]  Let me try to say this though, if we make the movement against the New World Order all about me or even about Ron Paul,
[2:03:10.720 --> 2:03:15.720]  they can set us up, they can kill us, they can destroy us in the media.
[2:03:15.720 --> 2:03:27.720]  But I agree this show, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, as a focal point of news and information is immeasurably important and valuable.
[2:03:27.720 --> 2:03:29.720]  And then I need to do a lot better job.
[2:03:29.720 --> 2:03:31.720]  I tend to get negative.
[2:03:31.720 --> 2:03:39.720]  If I'm up here till 2-3 in the morning and then I come back in the morning and I got a headache and I've got a stack of horrible news the globalists are doing,
[2:03:39.720 --> 2:03:43.720]  I don't get happy like, oh look, I get to expose them.
[2:03:43.720 --> 2:03:44.720]  This proves my case.
[2:03:44.720 --> 2:03:48.720]  I come in here and don't even cover 90% of it because I'm just sick of it.
[2:03:48.720 --> 2:03:55.720]  And I also can't believe how ridiculously corrupt and evil things have gotten and how the public doesn't see it.
[2:03:55.720 --> 2:03:59.720]  So yes, I do talk about a lot of people waking up, but I'm a human being.
[2:03:59.720 --> 2:04:02.720]  This is not a scripted, calculated show.
[2:04:02.720 --> 2:04:09.720]  And so I tend to blow up and throw fits and do everything else because, and it may turn off some people,
[2:04:09.720 --> 2:04:13.720]  but I think it actually turns on others to really hear somebody throw it in their face.
[2:04:13.720 --> 2:04:18.720]  I'm not trying to kiss their rear end to get them to listen to me and to wake up to what I'm doing.
[2:04:18.720 --> 2:04:23.720]  And I'm not trying to, I'm trying to really shock people out of their malaise with the truth.
[2:04:23.720 --> 2:04:31.720]  But again, I should act more like a leader, more genteel, more focused, and I'm trying to.
[2:04:31.720 --> 2:04:35.720]  But anything else you want to add there, Brian?
[2:04:35.720 --> 2:04:42.720]  Alex, if you just sort of rise above a little bit, I think some of these tactics will come in handy
[2:04:42.720 --> 2:04:47.720]  in terms of being able to maintain your mantle that you care.
[2:04:47.720 --> 2:04:55.720]  My mantle, good lord, I can barely make the equipment in here work much less my mantle.
[2:04:55.720 --> 2:05:18.720]  Oh man, we'll be right back with more of your calls.
[2:05:25.720 --> 2:05:32.720]  We'll be right back with more of your calls.

[2:08:28.720 --> 2:08:34.720]  They got combed my hair before I went on TV.
[2:08:34.720 --> 2:08:38.720]  Thank you for joining us. We're doing the last hour and 52 minutes.
[2:08:38.720 --> 2:08:42.720]  Some will cast at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[2:08:42.720 --> 2:08:50.720]  Coming up in 50 minutes, we have trends forecaster Gerald Solente to break down the latest developments in society and the economy.
[2:08:50.720 --> 2:08:59.720]  Where he sees Obama going now that his approval rating is the lowest in U.S. history in the last 100 years since they've been having scientific polling,
[2:08:59.720 --> 2:09:05.720]  he's now beating the previous number one loser, Jimmy Carter.
[2:09:05.720 --> 2:09:11.720]  As the fastest drop, he's gone from the mid-80s down to the low 50s.
[2:09:11.720 --> 2:09:20.720]  And some polls, he's below 50, will Barack Obama stage terror attacks? That is the question.
[2:09:20.720 --> 2:09:24.720]  And I want to play this one more time. Michael Savage getting it right.
[2:09:24.720 --> 2:09:33.720]  There's several of these clips where he's going on the radio and explaining that Barack Obama may stage terror attacks in the United States.
[2:09:33.720 --> 2:09:43.720]  Or a bio attack and say it's natural or a bio attack and say that it's man-made or launch a new war or further implode the economy.
[2:09:43.720 --> 2:09:54.720]  Then I have another clip coming up, Fox News Dr. Mark Siegel on rationing care saying it is a form of eugenics, which it is.
[2:09:54.720 --> 2:10:05.720]  And that dovetails with the White House science czar, the White House science czar, writing an 1100 page textbook for government adoption,
[2:10:05.720 --> 2:10:12.720]  calling for world government, CPS taking everyone's children at birth, forced inoculations with sterilization compounds,
[2:10:12.720 --> 2:10:14.720]  drugging of the food and water supply.
[2:10:14.720 --> 2:10:23.720]  So it's now in AP, New York Post, Fox News reporting on all of that.
[2:10:23.720 --> 2:10:30.720]  We also have, again, that USA Today article polls can affect presidents hold on party.
[2:10:30.720 --> 2:10:34.720]  And then if you look at the actual poll, that they have a copy of it.
[2:10:34.720 --> 2:10:36.720]  Let's pull that up from USA Today.
[2:10:36.720 --> 2:10:42.720]  I want to put on screen not just the article, but the poll that was on the page that came with this.
[2:10:42.720 --> 2:10:43.720]  Drudge was linked to it yesterday.
[2:10:43.720 --> 2:10:45.720]  I know I asked my webmasters to link to it.
[2:10:45.720 --> 2:10:48.720]  I don't know if they did at infowars.com and prisonbonnet.com.
[2:10:48.720 --> 2:10:51.720]  I didn't see it, but that doesn't mean it wasn't there.
[2:10:51.720 --> 2:11:01.720]  And you can see the Gallup poll for itself as he is now falling faster and has already fallen further than Jimmy Carter.
[2:11:01.720 --> 2:11:04.720]  So that is coming up as well today.
[2:11:04.720 --> 2:11:07.720]  Right now, let's go back to your calls.
[2:11:07.720 --> 2:11:09.720]  Let's talk to George in Texas.
[2:11:09.720 --> 2:11:10.720]  George, you're on the air.
[2:11:10.720 --> 2:11:11.720]  Go ahead.
[2:11:11.720 --> 2:11:12.720]  How are you doing, Alex?
[2:11:12.720 --> 2:11:13.720]  Good.
[2:11:13.720 --> 2:11:21.720]  You know, last weekend, I was kind of like humble, but I was kind of like, I felt joyful.
[2:11:21.720 --> 2:11:28.720]  Not to say I'm celebrating anybody's death, but at the same time, Walter Cronkite had his passing, also Alan Stang.
[2:11:28.720 --> 2:11:30.720]  And you got two different people.
[2:11:30.720 --> 2:11:39.720]  Alan Stang gave up a lot to warn us of the New World Order, but yet Walter Cronkite became the high priestess at Bohemian Grove
[2:11:39.720 --> 2:11:43.720]  and got all this notoriety and fame and sold his soul to the devil.
[2:11:43.720 --> 2:11:45.720]  Yeah, I forgot that part.
[2:11:45.720 --> 2:11:51.720]  He has, according to the annals of the Bohemian Grove, that I actually wasn't here in the office.
[2:11:51.720 --> 2:11:53.720]  So here it is.
[2:11:53.720 --> 2:12:02.720]  According to this annal, this is the internal annals of the Bohemian Grove, sent to me by one of the widows of one of these guys.
[2:12:02.720 --> 2:12:04.720]  I didn't know what a rare book it was.
[2:12:04.720 --> 2:12:09.720]  It goes for over a thousand bucks on eBay, one of these.
[2:12:09.720 --> 2:12:15.720]  Volume 8, volume 7, 1987 to 1996, 10-year volume.
[2:12:15.720 --> 2:12:20.720]  Weaving spiders come down here and it says Walter Cronkite is the high priest here.
[2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:28.720]  But I guess he's not the high priest this year while the Christian conservative leaders meet and have homosexual sex and worship Satan.
[2:12:28.720 --> 2:12:30.720]  And hey, that's their business if they want to do that.
[2:12:30.720 --> 2:12:32.720]  It's just they're not very Christian.
[2:12:32.720 --> 2:12:35.720]  Anyways, pretty interesting.
[2:12:35.720 --> 2:12:36.720]  Go ahead, sir.
[2:12:36.720 --> 2:12:40.720]  Yes, and also like Alan Stang, I know he was on your show.
[2:12:40.720 --> 2:12:44.720]  He was a guest on your show, but I know he passed away and I looked at a lot of his work.
[2:12:44.720 --> 2:12:52.720]  He could have been very easily sold out, went along, played along, became big as Dan Rather, but I'm glad he took the path he took.
[2:12:52.720 --> 2:12:53.720]  Yeah, that's right.
[2:12:53.720 --> 2:12:58.720]  I have him in the stack and I was digging around at the first of the show and I had like three stacks and couldn't find it.
[2:12:58.720 --> 2:13:08.720]  I was going to eulogize him at the beginning of the show, but tell folks about Alan Stang that don't know.
[2:13:08.720 --> 2:13:11.720]  I mean, he worked with Edward R. Murrow, didn't he?
[2:13:11.720 --> 2:13:14.720]  Yeah, I heard of Mike Wallace.
[2:13:14.720 --> 2:13:16.720]  But I think he worked with both of them.
[2:13:16.720 --> 2:13:18.720]  Both of them came from the same outfit, yeah.
[2:13:18.720 --> 2:13:28.720]  But the thing is, history is going to probably exalt Alan Stang for his work, but I think history is also going to vilify Walter Cronkite.
[2:13:28.720 --> 2:13:36.720]  Can you imagine all these big Republican billionaires and corporate CEOs dressing up like women and doing stuff in the woods together?
[2:13:36.720 --> 2:13:38.720]  I mean, it's just, look at that one.
[2:13:38.720 --> 2:13:42.720]  That's who wants your guns right there so they can have their way with it.
[2:13:42.720 --> 2:13:44.720]  And then look at these guys, they're really good at it.
[2:13:44.720 --> 2:13:51.720]  And I mean, I'm not even against gay people, but if these Republicans, you know, are want to be gay, that's their business.
[2:13:51.720 --> 2:13:55.720]  The problem is, is that they want to set up their police state and their new order system.
[2:13:55.720 --> 2:13:57.720]  But just look at these guys.
[2:13:57.720 --> 2:14:03.720]  I mean, zoom back in on that for folks at presentplanet.tv.
[2:14:03.720 --> 2:14:06.720]  I mean, that is really, really, really upsetting.
[2:14:06.720 --> 2:14:09.720]  Can you imagine getting in bed with one of those people?
[2:14:09.720 --> 2:14:13.720]  I mean, God almighty, that sounds like hell right there.
[2:14:13.720 --> 2:14:15.720]  But that was heaven to Walter Cronkite.
[2:14:15.720 --> 2:14:18.720]  I hear you, sir, and I appreciate your call.
[2:14:18.720 --> 2:14:21.720]  If I have to, I'll reprint the, it was on news with views.
[2:14:21.720 --> 2:14:24.720]  Again, I told my webmasters to link to it this morning.
[2:14:24.720 --> 2:14:27.720]  I don't know if they did a DV kids article about him.
[2:14:27.720 --> 2:14:33.720]  Just that, that looks like hell to me.
[2:14:33.720 --> 2:14:36.720]  But according to Walter Cronkite, that was a little piece of heaven.
[2:14:36.720 --> 2:14:38.720]  I mean, old men dressed up like women.
[2:14:38.720 --> 2:14:42.720]  My God, that sounds about as disgusting as it gets.
[2:14:42.720 --> 2:14:46.720]  I mean, I don't get these guys, even if they like men,
[2:14:46.720 --> 2:14:48.720]  what is it about they like old men?
[2:14:48.720 --> 2:14:52.720]  Call it bigoted, I just don't find men attractive,
[2:14:52.720 --> 2:14:54.720]  and I don't find old men attractive, especially.
[2:14:54.720 --> 2:15:00.720]  There's a bunch of them dressed up like women in here,
[2:15:00.720 --> 2:15:02.720]  and it's not just dressed up like women.
[2:15:02.720 --> 2:15:04.720]  I mean, they get real serious.
[2:15:04.720 --> 2:15:07.720]  Like, here's a photo of the cremation of care they took,
[2:15:07.720 --> 2:15:09.720]  and you'd say, oh, that's just stylized.
[2:15:09.720 --> 2:15:14.720]  No, the whole thing's a cultic, and they take it very, very serious.
[2:15:14.720 --> 2:15:15.720]  And I guess there's the high priest.
[2:15:15.720 --> 2:15:18.720]  I guess that's Walter Cronkite right there.
[2:15:18.720 --> 2:15:22.720]  They burned the effigy of the child.
[2:15:22.720 --> 2:15:31.720]  Here we got Mr. CIA, William F. Buckley, the fake conservative.
[2:15:31.720 --> 2:15:39.720]  Here we've got, I'm going to find a Walter Cronkite in here in a minute.
[2:15:39.720 --> 2:15:41.720]  I mean, here's another one of them.
[2:15:41.720 --> 2:15:43.720]  I mean, look at this guy.
[2:15:43.720 --> 2:15:46.720]  Get caught in the dark with him.
[2:15:46.720 --> 2:15:51.720]  That's the heir to the Reynolds fortune.
[2:15:51.720 --> 2:15:53.720]  I mean, they're all a bunch of fairies, folks.
[2:15:53.720 --> 2:15:55.720]  I mean, just look at them all.
[2:15:55.720 --> 2:15:57.720]  I'm a fairy.
[2:15:57.720 --> 2:15:58.720]  I'm a eugenicist.
[2:15:58.720 --> 2:16:03.720]  He's like, yeah, I may be a fairy, but I'm putting fluoride in her water, pal.
[2:16:03.720 --> 2:16:11.720]  You're not laughing at the fairy now, are you?
[2:16:11.720 --> 2:16:17.720]  I'm going to find it here in a moment.
[2:16:17.720 --> 2:16:18.720]  Oh, I'll never find it.
[2:16:18.720 --> 2:16:26.720]  You guys, look in the bibliography in the back and help me find Walter Cronkite.
[2:16:26.720 --> 2:16:29.720]  Oh, God, here's more of them dressed up like women.
[2:16:29.720 --> 2:16:32.720]  Look about nightmarish.
[2:16:32.720 --> 2:16:35.720]  I mean, that has got to be the most nightmarish thing ever.
[2:16:35.720 --> 2:16:37.720]  Here's my dressed up like death.
[2:16:37.720 --> 2:16:41.720]  He brings the body of the baby over to burn it.
[2:16:41.720 --> 2:16:44.720]  That's just some other creature.
[2:16:44.720 --> 2:16:46.720]  So there you have it.
[2:16:46.720 --> 2:16:50.720]  Here's all the old men and their leather on their motorcycles.
[2:16:50.720 --> 2:16:53.720]  They like buzzing into San Francisco to enjoy themselves.
[2:16:53.720 --> 2:16:56.720]  There's Gordon and Richard Nixon.
[2:16:56.720 --> 2:16:57.720]  That's what Nixon said.
[2:16:57.720 --> 2:16:59.720]  When am I going to somewhere in here?
[2:16:59.720 --> 2:17:05.720]  I'm going to find, there's Bob Hope.
[2:17:05.720 --> 2:17:07.720]  Okay, we're going to find others.
[2:17:07.720 --> 2:17:08.720]  Newt Gainrich and Bush Sr.
[2:17:08.720 --> 2:17:11.720]  Let's give folks some video of them.
[2:17:11.720 --> 2:17:14.720]  They always said don't call him junior, but in this, he's called junior.
[2:17:14.720 --> 2:17:18.720]  Well, next to Newt Gainrich, they're not in drag there.
[2:17:18.720 --> 2:17:21.720]  They hadn't gotten dressed yet for the evening.
[2:17:21.720 --> 2:17:23.720]  You're an old, weirdo, rich man.
[2:17:23.720 --> 2:17:24.720]  Rest up like women.
[2:17:24.720 --> 2:17:29.720]  Nailing around, chasing young prostitutes in the forest at night.
[2:17:29.720 --> 2:17:32.720]  It's so incredible.
[2:17:32.720 --> 2:17:35.720]  Yeah, find me.
[2:17:35.720 --> 2:17:37.720]  Find me Walter Cronkite.
[2:17:37.720 --> 2:17:39.720]  I know he's in there.
[2:17:39.720 --> 2:17:41.720]  Okay, enough about Walter Cronkite.
[2:17:41.720 --> 2:17:43.720]  Nothing about Walter Cronkite.
[2:17:43.720 --> 2:17:45.720]  There's some more about Walter Cronkite.
[2:17:45.720 --> 2:17:49.720]  Here he is at the right hand of Satan.
[2:17:49.720 --> 2:17:53.720]  Walter Cronkite, our good friend.
[2:17:53.720 --> 2:17:54.720]  Here he is.
[2:17:54.720 --> 2:17:59.720]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[2:17:59.720 --> 2:18:04.720]  Let us hear the appeal of a new international Liberty Bell
[2:18:04.720 --> 2:18:09.720]  that calls us all to the creation of a system of enforceable world law
[2:18:09.720 --> 2:18:16.720]  in which the universal desire for peace can face its hope and its prayers.
[2:18:16.720 --> 2:18:22.720]  Thank you.
[2:18:22.720 --> 2:18:28.720]  We would like to bring you a message from the First Lady of the United States,
[2:18:28.720 --> 2:18:31.720]  Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[2:18:31.720 --> 2:18:32.720]  Good evening.
[2:18:32.720 --> 2:18:33.720]  Congratulations, Walter.
[2:18:33.720 --> 2:18:35.720]  I wanted to show you that video.
[2:18:35.720 --> 2:18:37.720]  We didn't have it punched up for some reason.
[2:18:37.720 --> 2:18:38.720]  Back it up.
[2:18:38.720 --> 2:18:41.720]  I want people to see Walter Cronkite calling for world government
[2:18:41.720 --> 2:18:43.720]  and sitting at the right hand of Satan,
[2:18:43.720 --> 2:18:47.720]  known as Hillary Clinton.
[2:18:47.720 --> 2:18:50.720]  And again, this would just be a joke if the guy didn't dress up
[2:18:50.720 --> 2:18:52.720]  as a druidic high priest.
[2:18:52.720 --> 2:18:56.720]  Here it is.
[2:18:56.720 --> 2:19:03.720]  Attempt to achieve world order before that time must be the work of the devil.
[2:19:03.720 --> 2:19:04.720]  Well, join me.
[2:19:04.720 --> 2:19:09.720]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[2:19:09.720 --> 2:19:14.720]  Let's hear the appeal of a new international Liberty Bell
[2:19:14.720 --> 2:19:19.720]  that calls us all to the creation of a system of enforceable world law
[2:19:19.720 --> 2:19:25.720]  in which the universal desire for peace can face its hope and its prayers.
[2:19:25.720 --> 2:19:27.720]  Thank you.
[2:19:27.720 --> 2:19:31.720]  And now for Hillary calling for world government.
[2:19:31.720 --> 2:19:37.720]  We would like to bring you a message from the First Lady of the United States,
[2:19:37.720 --> 2:19:39.720]  Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[2:19:39.720 --> 2:19:40.720]  Ah!
[2:19:40.720 --> 2:19:43.720]  Good evening and congratulations, Walter.
[2:19:43.720 --> 2:19:45.720]  I'm receiving a world federalist association.
[2:19:45.720 --> 2:19:46.720]  Good evening, Walter.
[2:19:46.720 --> 2:19:47.720]  You're now in health.
[2:19:47.720 --> 2:19:49.720]  Just like the one in America.
[2:19:49.720 --> 2:19:51.720]  All right, what do I do?
[2:19:51.720 --> 2:19:54.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, more of your calls and a ton of news.
[2:19:54.720 --> 2:19:56.720]  Stay with us.
[2:20:01.720 --> 2:20:03.720]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[2:20:03.720 --> 2:20:06.720]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[2:20:06.720 --> 2:20:08.720]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[2:20:08.720 --> 2:20:09.720]  Here's the story.
[2:20:09.720 --> 2:20:12.720]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare,
[2:20:12.720 --> 2:20:14.720]  giving 40 million new people free care.
[2:20:14.720 --> 2:20:15.720]  Now here's the bad news.
[2:20:15.720 --> 2:20:19.720]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands
[2:20:19.720 --> 2:20:20.720]  for free services and procedures.
[2:20:20.720 --> 2:20:22.720]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt.
[2:20:22.720 --> 2:20:25.720]  Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened
[2:20:25.720 --> 2:20:27.720]  by the prospect of forced procedures.
[2:20:27.720 --> 2:20:29.720]  All this is creating a perfect storm,
[2:20:29.720 --> 2:20:32.720]  which could create unimaginable shortages in the healthcare services.
[2:20:32.720 --> 2:20:34.720]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[2:20:34.720 --> 2:20:37.720]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up
[2:20:37.720 --> 2:20:39.720]  with an emergency preparedness course
[2:20:39.720 --> 2:20:42.720]  that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines
[2:20:42.720 --> 2:20:43.720]  in the privacy of your own home.
[2:20:43.720 --> 2:20:46.720]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies
[2:20:46.720 --> 2:20:48.720]  and is flat out the best course of its kind.
[2:20:48.720 --> 2:20:51.720]  I recommend you visit this important new website at
[2:20:51.720 --> 2:20:52.720]  MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[2:20:52.720 --> 2:20:54.720]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com
[2:20:54.720 --> 2:20:59.720]  or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[2:21:00.720 --> 2:21:02.720]  Have you ever felt like the United States government
[2:21:02.720 --> 2:21:04.720]  knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[2:21:04.720 --> 2:21:07.720]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures,
[2:21:07.720 --> 2:21:10.720]  frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[2:21:10.720 --> 2:21:13.720]  It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have the right
[2:21:13.720 --> 2:21:16.720]  to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[2:21:16.720 --> 2:21:19.720]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act,
[2:21:19.720 --> 2:21:22.720]  the IRS Revenue ruling 6045 of 1984
[2:21:22.720 --> 2:21:24.720]  and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's
[2:21:24.720 --> 2:21:26.720]  executive order of 1933,
[2:21:26.720 --> 2:21:30.720]  some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[2:21:30.720 --> 2:21:33.720]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report
[2:21:33.720 --> 2:21:36.720]  explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[2:21:36.720 --> 2:21:39.720]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not,
[2:21:39.720 --> 2:21:42.720]  I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[2:21:42.720 --> 2:21:46.720]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[2:21:46.720 --> 2:21:49.720]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[2:21:49.720 --> 2:21:52.720]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[2:21:52.720 --> 2:21:55.720]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[2:21:55.720 --> 2:22:00.720]  1-800-686-2237.
[2:22:00.720 --> 2:22:03.720]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[2:22:03.720 --> 2:22:06.720]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:22:06.720 --> 2:22:09.720]  We've got to have a civilian national security force
[2:22:09.720 --> 2:22:13.720]  that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[2:22:13.720 --> 2:22:17.720]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[2:22:17.720 --> 2:22:20.720]  that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[2:22:20.720 --> 2:22:22.720]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[2:22:22.720 --> 2:22:25.720]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[2:22:25.720 --> 2:22:29.720]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[2:22:29.720 --> 2:22:35.720]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[2:22:35.720 --> 2:22:36.720]  that's fascism.
[2:22:36.720 --> 2:22:38.720]  It's not about left or right.
[2:22:38.720 --> 2:22:40.720]  It's about a one-world government.
[2:22:40.720 --> 2:22:43.720]  This film documents who Obama works for,
[2:22:43.720 --> 2:22:45.720]  the lies he is told,
[2:22:45.720 --> 2:22:47.720]  and his real agenda.
[2:22:47.720 --> 2:22:50.720]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today

[2:24:09.720 --> 2:24:12.720]  You know, it is wrong to speak ill of the dead
[2:24:12.720 --> 2:24:15.720]  unless it's like Joseph Stalin or Adolf Hitler.
[2:24:18.720 --> 2:24:21.720]  But here is Richard Nixon, art link letter.
[2:24:21.720 --> 2:24:23.720]  He's still alive.
[2:24:23.720 --> 2:24:26.720]  And then right next to him, Walter Cronkite.
[2:24:29.720 --> 2:24:30.720]  You know what's weird?
[2:24:30.720 --> 2:24:32.720]  I showed this book about a week and a half ago on TV
[2:24:32.720 --> 2:24:34.720]  and showed the Richard Nixon and said,
[2:24:34.720 --> 2:24:37.720]  oh, there's Walter Cronkite and then boom, he's dead.
[2:24:37.720 --> 2:24:39.720]  There's Gerald Ford beneath him.
[2:24:39.720 --> 2:24:42.720]  There's Richard Nixon.
[2:24:42.720 --> 2:24:47.720]  Here's the guys swimming around enjoying themselves.
[2:24:51.720 --> 2:24:54.720]  CPS gives them an endless supply.
[2:24:57.720 --> 2:24:59.720]  Oh, I can't look at any more of this.
[2:24:59.720 --> 2:25:02.720]  It was Mayor Willie Brown got the warning not to fly on 9-11
[2:25:02.720 --> 2:25:04.720]  because he's a good friend.
[2:25:04.720 --> 2:25:07.720]  I guess you can be trusted.
[2:25:07.720 --> 2:25:09.720]  All right, I'm done looking at this.
[2:25:09.720 --> 2:25:10.720]  We're done.
[2:25:10.720 --> 2:25:13.720]  Got a lot of other news I want to get to before.
[2:25:13.720 --> 2:25:17.720]  Gerald Salente joins us next hour on a host of key issues.
[2:25:17.720 --> 2:25:20.720]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[2:25:20.720 --> 2:25:22.720]  I talked to George or Stevia.
[2:25:22.720 --> 2:25:23.720]  Who's up next?
[2:25:23.720 --> 2:25:25.720]  Or is it Justin?
[2:25:25.720 --> 2:25:28.720]  Steve in Texas, go ahead.
[2:25:28.720 --> 2:25:30.720]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[2:25:30.720 --> 2:25:31.720]  Hi.
[2:25:31.720 --> 2:25:32.720]  Thank you.
[2:25:32.720 --> 2:25:34.720]  Thank you for all your good work.
[2:25:34.720 --> 2:25:36.720]  Thank you for calling.
[2:25:36.720 --> 2:25:39.720]  I would just like to say what I was going to say
[2:25:39.720 --> 2:25:43.720]  and if I may comment on one of the previous callers
[2:25:43.720 --> 2:25:45.720]  about Rush Limbaugh.
[2:25:45.720 --> 2:25:48.720]  Brother, we didn't screen your call, did we?
[2:25:48.720 --> 2:25:49.720]  No.
[2:25:49.720 --> 2:25:50.720]  Did we ask your name?
[2:25:50.720 --> 2:25:53.720]  You can say your name is Pumpernickel from Possumville.
[2:25:53.720 --> 2:25:55.720]  You are on the air uncensored.
[2:25:55.720 --> 2:25:56.720]  Go ahead.
[2:25:56.720 --> 2:25:59.720]  It makes me really sick about the media,
[2:25:59.720 --> 2:26:01.720]  how they portray the 9-11 truthers.
[2:26:01.720 --> 2:26:04.720]  Because instead of showing your documentaries
[2:26:04.720 --> 2:26:06.720]  like Terror Storm or the 9-11 Chronicles,
[2:26:06.720 --> 2:26:10.720]  all they do is they just show when the 9-11 truthers
[2:26:10.720 --> 2:26:13.720]  are protesting and when they're just chanting 9-11
[2:26:13.720 --> 2:26:15.720]  is an inside job.
[2:26:15.720 --> 2:26:18.720]  They never show you or Luke Rudofsky talk about
[2:26:18.720 --> 2:26:21.720]  all the facts and everything.
[2:26:21.720 --> 2:26:24.720]  Well, they do that, but also the history channel
[2:26:24.720 --> 2:26:26.720]  lied and said it wasn't a hit piece.
[2:26:26.720 --> 2:26:30.720]  And then we had this UT conference room
[2:26:30.720 --> 2:26:33.720]  that held about 400 people full of folks.
[2:26:33.720 --> 2:26:36.720]  They would wait till the hour recess
[2:26:36.720 --> 2:26:39.720]  and shoot video of the empty bleachers
[2:26:39.720 --> 2:26:41.720]  or like one guy sitting there eating a sandwich.
[2:26:41.720 --> 2:26:43.720]  And then they would cut from me giving a speech
[2:26:43.720 --> 2:26:45.720]  to empty bleachers to make it look like
[2:26:45.720 --> 2:26:46.720]  nobody was there to hear me.
[2:26:46.720 --> 2:26:49.720]  They would blow my face up, stretch the video,
[2:26:49.720 --> 2:26:50.720]  make it look yellow.
[2:26:50.720 --> 2:26:53.720]  And when they showed the real yellow journalist
[2:26:53.720 --> 2:26:55.720]  from Popular Mechanics, Hearst Publishing,
[2:26:55.720 --> 2:26:58.720]  was glistening stainless steel, perfect camera,
[2:26:58.720 --> 2:27:01.720]  you know, color, everything tuned perfectly.
[2:27:01.720 --> 2:27:04.720]  And they would say expert beneath them.
[2:27:04.720 --> 2:27:07.720]  But the good news is that crap doesn't work.
[2:27:07.720 --> 2:27:10.720]  I mean, we have Gary Hart writing public letters
[2:27:10.720 --> 2:27:13.720]  saying Dick Cheney may stage terror attacks.
[2:27:13.720 --> 2:27:15.720]  We have generals quitting saying it.
[2:27:15.720 --> 2:27:18.720]  We have Michael Savage saying
[2:27:18.720 --> 2:27:20.720]  Obama may stage terror attacks
[2:27:20.720 --> 2:27:21.720]  or Will stage terror attacks.
[2:27:21.720 --> 2:27:24.720]  I mean, we've won the war for hearts and minds.
[2:27:24.720 --> 2:27:27.720]  People know government stage is terror.
[2:27:27.720 --> 2:27:30.720]  It's in the Army Field Manual, 2004.
[2:27:30.720 --> 2:27:33.720]  How to train, how to stage terror.
[2:27:33.720 --> 2:27:36.720]  And so people now, every time there's a terror attack,
[2:27:36.720 --> 2:27:38.720]  look at who stands to gain from it.
[2:27:38.720 --> 2:27:41.720]  And so let the New York Times and Wall Street Journal
[2:27:41.720 --> 2:27:42.720]  play their games.
[2:27:42.720 --> 2:27:44.720]  We play ours with the truth.
[2:27:44.720 --> 2:27:47.720]  They've got flimsy lies they're fighting us with.
[2:27:47.720 --> 2:27:49.720]  And they may be able to have a big tsunami
[2:27:49.720 --> 2:27:53.720]  of mainstream media power to try to slap us down.
[2:27:53.720 --> 2:27:59.720]  But the establishment is so discredited now
[2:27:59.720 --> 2:28:02.720]  that basically anything and everything,
[2:28:02.720 --> 2:28:04.720]  they say people don't believe.
[2:28:04.720 --> 2:28:08.720]  And so they completely blown their credibility.
[2:28:08.720 --> 2:28:11.720]  So let them make up whatever delusional crap they want.
[2:28:11.720 --> 2:28:13.720]  I mean, I'm not buying it, are you?
[2:28:13.720 --> 2:28:17.720]  Good to hear from you.
[2:28:17.720 --> 2:28:19.720]  Appreciate the call.
[2:28:19.720 --> 2:28:20.720]  Appreciate the call, Steve.
[2:28:20.720 --> 2:28:22.720]  Justin in North Carolina.
[2:28:22.720 --> 2:28:23.720]  Justin, you're on the air.
[2:28:23.720 --> 2:28:25.720]  Hey, Alex, two quick things.
[2:28:25.720 --> 2:28:28.720]  I have a little internet radio show in Jack McClam.
[2:28:28.720 --> 2:28:30.720]  I know you've interviewed him before.
[2:28:30.720 --> 2:28:32.720]  It was on my show about two weeks ago.
[2:28:32.720 --> 2:28:36.720]  And he was giving a dire warning of the 27th to the 31st as well.
[2:28:36.720 --> 2:28:39.720]  I know you had a caller that brought it up not too long ago.
[2:28:39.720 --> 2:28:41.720]  So this is something that he said the sources,
[2:28:41.720 --> 2:28:45.720]  his sources inside the military and his ex-police contacts
[2:28:45.720 --> 2:28:48.720]  were telling him that this was something that they were worried about.
[2:28:48.720 --> 2:28:50.720]  So I think everybody that listens to your show
[2:28:50.720 --> 2:28:53.720]  that it's involved in this movement should be very serious.
[2:28:53.720 --> 2:28:57.720]  Well, by exposing that they do tend to launch terror attacks
[2:28:57.720 --> 2:28:59.720]  during their drills as a cover story
[2:28:59.720 --> 2:29:01.720]  in case any of their assets get caught
[2:29:01.720 --> 2:29:04.720]  by other sectors of the government that aren't involved in the attacks,
[2:29:04.720 --> 2:29:08.720]  if the compartmentalization membrane is broken.
[2:29:08.720 --> 2:29:12.720]  A lot of times by exposing these events, it stops them from doing it.
[2:29:12.720 --> 2:29:14.720]  And I like Jack and I appreciate him,
[2:29:14.720 --> 2:29:19.720]  but I don't like putting dates on things unless I'm totally sure.
[2:29:19.720 --> 2:29:21.720]  You know, even when I got on air and said,
[2:29:21.720 --> 2:29:23.720]  call the White House, tell them don't blow up the World Trade Center
[2:29:23.720 --> 2:29:25.720]  and blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[2:29:25.720 --> 2:29:27.720]  Even when I did that, I didn't really give a date.
[2:29:27.720 --> 2:29:29.720]  I said, the next two months.
[2:29:31.720 --> 2:29:32.720]  I understand.
[2:29:32.720 --> 2:29:34.720]  Another thing I wanted to ask you too while I got you on air,
[2:29:34.720 --> 2:29:37.720]  I want to try to get you on record, Alex, and ask you a question.
[2:29:37.720 --> 2:29:39.720]  I've got a lot of friends inside this movement
[2:29:39.720 --> 2:29:41.720]  and they seem to think that if something happens
[2:29:41.720 --> 2:29:45.720]  like a major false flag, they're going to take all their cues from you.
[2:29:45.720 --> 2:29:47.720]  I just wanted to ask you, are you prepared?
[2:29:47.720 --> 2:29:48.720]  Stay there. Stay there.
[2:29:48.720 --> 2:29:50.720]  We got to finish up after the break.
[2:29:50.720 --> 2:29:52.720]  We're on the march.
[2:29:52.720 --> 2:29:54.720]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:54.720 --> 2:29:58.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:25.720 --> 2:30:28.720]  I believe now is the time that you and your family
[2:30:28.720 --> 2:30:30.720]  need to be armed and trained to levels
[2:30:30.720 --> 2:30:33.720]  that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[2:30:33.720 --> 2:30:37.720]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality
[2:30:37.720 --> 2:30:39.720]  or drill instructor attitudes.
[2:30:39.720 --> 2:30:40.720]  This is real.
[2:30:40.720 --> 2:30:41.720]  Don't miss out.
[2:30:41.720 --> 2:30:44.720]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course
[2:30:44.720 --> 2:30:47.720]  plus a 30-state concealed weapons permit
[2:30:47.720 --> 2:30:50.720]  or pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.
[2:30:50.720 --> 2:30:52.720]  Go to frontsite.com today.
[2:30:52.720 --> 2:30:56.720]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[2:30:56.720 --> 2:31:00.720]  Go to frontsite.com for your training and free gun.
[2:31:00.720 --> 2:31:02.720]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[2:31:02.720 --> 2:31:05.720]  you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[2:31:05.720 --> 2:31:07.720]  Number one, new climate legislation
[2:31:07.720 --> 2:31:09.720]  could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:31:09.720 --> 2:31:11.720]  Number two, our new energies are,
[2:31:11.720 --> 2:31:13.720]  wants to control how much power
[2:31:13.720 --> 2:31:15.720]  your electric company allows you to have.
[2:31:15.720 --> 2:31:16.720]  It's true.
[2:31:16.720 --> 2:31:18.720]  Total government control of electricity
[2:31:18.720 --> 2:31:20.720]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:31:20.720 --> 2:31:22.720]  Number three, in some areas of the country,
[2:31:22.720 --> 2:31:24.720]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[2:31:24.720 --> 2:31:26.720]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[2:31:26.720 --> 2:31:28.720]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous
[2:31:28.720 --> 2:31:30.720]  summer storm season is here again.
[2:31:30.720 --> 2:31:32.720]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[2:31:32.720 --> 2:31:34.720]  from weather-related outages.
[2:31:34.720 --> 2:31:36.720]  Number five, a solar power generator
[2:31:36.720 --> 2:31:38.720]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:31:38.720 --> 2:31:41.720]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[2:31:41.720 --> 2:31:43.720]  offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:31:43.720 --> 2:31:44.720]  a longtime sponsor of ours.

[2:31:51.720 --> 2:31:53.720]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet,

[2:32:55.720 --> 2:32:57.720]  To take action today, the first step is getting
[2:32:57.720 --> 2:33:26.720]  storable food.
[2:33:27.720 --> 2:33:37.720]  We look down a river and we see the British come,
[2:33:37.720 --> 2:33:40.720]  and they must have been a hundred of beaten on the drum.
[2:33:40.720 --> 2:33:43.720]  They stepped so high and they made the bugles ring.
[2:33:43.720 --> 2:33:46.720]  We stood beside our cotton veils and didn't say a thing.
[2:33:46.720 --> 2:33:48.720]  We fired our guns and the British kept becoming.
[2:33:48.720 --> 2:33:51.720]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[2:33:51.720 --> 2:33:54.720]  We fired once more and they began to run in.
[2:33:54.720 --> 2:33:58.720]  Steve in Texas is already talking to Ronnie.
[2:33:58.720 --> 2:34:01.720]  Ronnie in Texas.
[2:34:01.720 --> 2:34:05.720]  Now we're talking to Justin.
[2:34:05.720 --> 2:34:10.720]  A new call list.
[2:34:10.720 --> 2:34:12.720]  Justin, Steve, Ronnie, Travis, and others.
[2:34:12.720 --> 2:34:14.720]  We're talking to Justin in North Carolina.
[2:34:14.720 --> 2:34:17.800]  interrupted by the break there go ahead and make your point
[2:34:17.800 --> 2:34:21.080]  yeah i was what i was saying was like you you've got gerald swentay coming up
[2:34:21.080 --> 2:34:24.320]  here in a few minutes and uh... he's got a uh... youtube video that he just
[2:34:24.320 --> 2:34:25.660]  recently did
[2:34:25.660 --> 2:34:29.200]  uh... where he said that there would be a revolution in america now he's a
[2:34:29.200 --> 2:34:32.320]  trend forecaster we take our cues from him he's been
[2:34:32.320 --> 2:34:35.200]  pretty accurate in the past though this is a man who knows what he's talking
[2:34:35.200 --> 2:34:40.080]  about but the rapid all up in the world share in the establishment is said
[2:34:40.080 --> 2:34:43.640]  that they're setting up a police state knowing what they were going to do
[2:34:43.640 --> 2:34:45.600]  would cause a revolution so
[2:34:45.600 --> 2:34:48.720]  yeah i mean you're always a smart guy but he's he's basically saying
[2:34:48.720 --> 2:34:51.800]  he's predicting the sun will come up in the morning
[2:34:51.800 --> 2:34:52.700]  well yeah
[2:34:52.700 --> 2:34:56.920]  but what i want to ask you was i'm i mean i i listen to you show and i know
[2:34:56.920 --> 2:35:01.240]  your stance and i know your position sure go ahead and question
[2:35:01.240 --> 2:35:04.360]  well push comes to show very are you willing to lead this group of mary
[2:35:04.360 --> 2:35:08.720]  men and and patriots or you know how's it gonna go down to the lot of people
[2:35:08.720 --> 2:35:10.640]  are taking their cues from you so
[2:35:10.640 --> 2:35:13.680]  i think we've just dug into the trenches and got ready for the idea that
[2:35:13.680 --> 2:35:16.960]  sooner or later we're gonna have to fight we're looking for a leader
[2:35:16.960 --> 2:35:20.640]  will it be you or will be someone else
[2:35:20.640 --> 2:35:22.440]  well i think the leader
[2:35:22.440 --> 2:35:24.160]  is going to be
[2:35:24.160 --> 2:35:27.600]  every individual out there and i appreciate your call
[2:35:27.600 --> 2:35:29.000]  you know
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:33.600]  there's different types of people in this world
[2:35:33.600 --> 2:35:35.240]  and
[2:35:35.240 --> 2:35:37.440]  there's a type i see a lot
[2:35:37.440 --> 2:35:41.080]  who always plan for what's going to come
[2:35:41.080 --> 2:35:43.600]  instead of dealing with happening now
[2:35:43.600 --> 2:35:49.360]  now ideal of the past ideal of the present ideal of the future
[2:35:49.360 --> 2:35:53.240]  and so i don't know what the globalist are going to do
[2:35:53.240 --> 2:35:57.600]  i don't know what aces up their sleeve i know what group of aces are up their
[2:35:57.600 --> 2:35:59.980]  sleeve i don't know which card they're gonna play
[2:35:59.980 --> 2:36:03.560]  so i try to prepare people for different eventualities
[2:36:03.560 --> 2:36:05.880]  different scenarios
[2:36:05.880 --> 2:36:09.800]  that can unfold and a lot of people i talk to say i'm just buying guns and
[2:36:09.800 --> 2:36:11.640]  food and ammo for ten years
[2:36:11.640 --> 2:36:14.680]  i'm not going to go to city council or county commissioners or the state house
[2:36:14.680 --> 2:36:15.400]  or
[2:36:15.400 --> 2:36:17.920]  talk radio or access tv or
[2:36:17.920 --> 2:36:21.360]  the gun shows i'm not going to warn anybody
[2:36:21.360 --> 2:36:25.240]  uh... i'm not going to go speak up at my church
[2:36:25.240 --> 2:36:30.480]  i'm not going to get involved i'm just going to wait for war to start
[2:36:30.480 --> 2:36:35.400]  and then i'm going to go out and basically blast police and military
[2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:38.840]  or i'm going to shoot whoever comes to my house to get my guns
[2:36:38.840 --> 2:36:41.480]  they're just going to turn the food and water off for six months and let your
[2:36:41.480 --> 2:36:43.280]  neighbors burn you out
[2:36:43.280 --> 2:36:45.680]  if they go to that scenario
[2:36:45.680 --> 2:36:50.680]  i mean in a situation of warfare ninety percent of it is propaganda
[2:36:50.680 --> 2:36:52.840]  they call it info war
[2:36:52.840 --> 2:36:56.680]  black propaganda which is lies white propaganda that's true we use white
[2:36:56.680 --> 2:36:59.280]  propaganda their favorite is black propaganda or
[2:36:59.280 --> 2:37:03.360]  kind of a great propaganda that's a twisting of it
[2:37:03.360 --> 2:37:06.440]  that's what makes our information so much stronger it's historical it's factual
[2:37:06.440 --> 2:37:07.640]  it's based on reality
[2:37:07.640 --> 2:37:10.280]  they lie and get caught lying we tell the truth
[2:37:10.280 --> 2:37:13.600]  and get verified over time so our credibility goes up and up and up
[2:37:13.600 --> 2:37:15.640]  even about delivery sometimes is pretty
[2:37:15.640 --> 2:37:20.160]  haphazard and obnoxious it's real
[2:37:20.160 --> 2:37:21.680]  people resonate with that
[2:37:21.680 --> 2:37:25.880]  we got guts and guts is enough
[2:37:25.880 --> 2:37:29.760]  but if i tried to make myself a leader and if i tried to
[2:37:29.760 --> 2:37:33.120]  say i'm your president or i'm your colonial leader
[2:37:33.120 --> 2:37:36.760]  number one would look ridiculous to the general public as it would be
[2:37:36.760 --> 2:37:39.960]  and uh... number two
[2:37:39.960 --> 2:37:43.280]  it would make me a major target and then would weaken the whole movement
[2:37:43.280 --> 2:37:44.680]  because it would be
[2:37:44.680 --> 2:37:47.160]  a unified vertically integrated
[2:37:47.160 --> 2:37:50.720]  top-down power structure
[2:37:50.720 --> 2:37:54.280]  that's why having too many eggs in the ron paul basket i've said supporting
[2:37:54.280 --> 2:37:56.000]  he's a great focal point
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:37:59.600]  but they can demonize him they can marginalize him and he'll get old
[2:37:59.600 --> 2:38:02.920]  it's got to be about the information ron paul has said that
[2:38:02.920 --> 2:38:05.120]  over and over and over again
[2:38:05.120 --> 2:38:08.200]  anytime you try to compliment him he explains no no it's the idea
[2:38:08.200 --> 2:38:12.400]  i'm just a focus of this one of the focuses
[2:38:12.400 --> 2:38:17.320]  so
[2:38:17.320 --> 2:38:20.800]  because of the nature of our society
[2:38:20.800 --> 2:38:22.980]  and what's going on in it
[2:38:22.980 --> 2:38:27.680]  now is the critical time to speak out now is the critical time to be involved
[2:38:27.680 --> 2:38:29.160]  now is the time
[2:38:29.160 --> 2:38:31.400]  to be
[2:38:31.400 --> 2:38:33.640]  reaching out to people
[2:38:33.640 --> 2:38:36.200]  in any and every way we can
[2:38:36.200 --> 2:38:39.400]  because as the police state cracks down as the restrictions on free speech
[2:38:39.400 --> 2:38:40.440]  cracks down
[2:38:40.440 --> 2:38:43.680]  it's going to be harder and harder why are they cracking down on freedom of
[2:38:43.680 --> 2:38:47.560]  assembly and freedom of the press and all this because it's hurting them
[2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:50.960]  they don't like it because they're vulnerable
[2:38:50.960 --> 2:38:54.560]  so instead of just wearing camo and wearing black bandanas and hiding out
[2:38:54.560 --> 2:38:55.560]  the woods and
[2:38:55.560 --> 2:38:59.360]  having people salute you as the captain and malicious struggling over the
[2:38:59.360 --> 2:39:00.880]  power structure and
[2:39:00.880 --> 2:39:04.760]  you know i watch the uh... republic of texas
[2:39:04.760 --> 2:39:07.400]  and not all of them were four or five different factions but
[2:39:07.400 --> 2:39:09.400]  mainly it was people in trailers
[2:39:09.400 --> 2:39:13.320]  being saluted by their nephews and nieces and they had admirals with with
[2:39:13.320 --> 2:39:15.160]  pontoon boats and
[2:39:15.160 --> 2:39:17.840]  if you want to fire arm your general
[2:39:17.840 --> 2:39:22.320]  and they would wear military outfits and and and looking like clowns
[2:39:22.320 --> 2:39:24.600]  and i know a lot of must have been feds
[2:39:24.600 --> 2:39:27.120]  that's all their interactions with police they were meant
[2:39:27.120 --> 2:39:29.520]  down the road the global assault texas
[2:39:29.520 --> 2:39:31.800]  sovereignty or secession as a threat
[2:39:31.800 --> 2:39:37.040]  it was meant to art type it as a clown
[2:39:37.040 --> 2:39:38.720]  and
[2:39:38.720 --> 2:39:41.760]  this is what they do
[2:39:41.760 --> 2:39:45.280]  and so instead of talking about who the leader is and talking about the
[2:39:45.280 --> 2:39:47.600]  organizations we're going to build and
[2:39:47.600 --> 2:39:49.720]  committees and meetings and
[2:39:49.720 --> 2:39:53.520]  you know there's so many groups just have committee meetings and groups and
[2:39:53.520 --> 2:39:56.880]  they make you honorary members and they call you and say
[2:39:56.880 --> 2:40:00.160]  do you want to make decisions do you want to be and i'm too busy
[2:40:00.160 --> 2:40:03.320]  manning the guns in the info war
[2:40:03.320 --> 2:40:06.800]  and trying to wake up as many people's i can do as many radio interviews i can
[2:40:06.800 --> 2:40:07.400]  do
[2:40:07.400 --> 2:40:10.120]  as many news articles as many films
[2:40:10.120 --> 2:40:11.440]  and i'm just here
[2:40:11.440 --> 2:40:12.640]  trying to say
[2:40:12.640 --> 2:40:15.160]  wake up the next person discredit the system
[2:40:15.160 --> 2:40:20.640]  expose false flag terror expose the globalist
[2:40:20.640 --> 2:40:25.280]  so somebody asking me are you going to lead us i am already leading
[2:40:25.280 --> 2:40:27.760]  there's a reason i'm leading people
[2:40:27.760 --> 2:40:31.000]  there's a reason i'm the most hardcore the most
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:32.160]  effective
[2:40:32.160 --> 2:40:35.800]  the most focused and that i mean i'm doing a perfect job
[2:40:35.800 --> 2:40:39.320]  it's because i will put the hours and i will do the job i will do the radio
[2:40:39.320 --> 2:40:43.440]  shows i will make the films i will write the books i will interview the guest i
[2:40:43.440 --> 2:40:44.520]  will
[2:40:44.520 --> 2:40:49.840]  take action and then my listeners are taking action and their leaders
[2:40:49.840 --> 2:40:51.400]  and so
[2:40:51.400 --> 2:40:55.160]  i believe in a county and city and state and regional level
[2:40:55.160 --> 2:40:56.680]  there are leaders out there
[2:40:56.680 --> 2:40:58.520]  and they're going to be state representatives and they're going to be
[2:40:58.520 --> 2:41:01.360]  congressmen and women
[2:41:01.360 --> 2:41:05.520]  and uh... they are there
[2:41:05.520 --> 2:41:08.360]  and many governors have risen
[2:41:08.360 --> 2:41:12.640]  like elliot spitzer was going to expose the banks and he had one
[2:41:12.640 --> 2:41:16.280]  skeleton in his closet and they blew him away
[2:41:16.280 --> 2:41:17.760]  and uh... this other
[2:41:17.760 --> 2:41:20.400]  governor was starting to fight the new world order he'd actually been to
[2:41:20.400 --> 2:41:21.800]  billderberg
[2:41:21.800 --> 2:41:23.960]  but he had rejected him according to what he said and
[2:41:23.960 --> 2:41:27.200]  thinks they were a bunch of old clowns they didn't like that by the way
[2:41:27.200 --> 2:41:30.960]  not saying he's perfect but you know he had some skeletons
[2:41:30.960 --> 2:41:34.520]  cheating on his wife and they're there destroying him
[2:41:34.520 --> 2:41:37.720]  and palin isn't perfect and got her own problems but they're going to destroy
[2:41:37.720 --> 2:41:38.600]  her
[2:41:38.600 --> 2:41:41.560]  because she's calling for state sovereignty
[2:41:41.560 --> 2:41:44.040]  and democrats like spitzer
[2:41:44.040 --> 2:41:46.280]  there they destroyed him
[2:41:46.280 --> 2:41:47.880]  uh... and uh...
[2:41:47.880 --> 2:41:50.800]  blagojevic as bad as he was
[2:41:50.800 --> 2:41:54.160]  they destroyed him because
[2:41:54.160 --> 2:41:54.920]  he kicked
[2:41:54.920 --> 2:41:58.080]  back of america out was a great article written over the weekend info wars dot
[2:41:58.080 --> 2:41:58.760]  com
[2:41:58.760 --> 2:42:01.480]  by one of our op-ed writers one of volunteer writers
[2:42:01.480 --> 2:42:03.560]  and write your own stories and if they're good we'll post them
[2:42:03.560 --> 2:42:06.160]  writers info wars dot com
[2:42:06.160 --> 2:42:10.960]  and it was a great article about how they're going after governors
[2:42:10.960 --> 2:42:12.720]  something like anti
[2:42:12.720 --> 2:42:15.720]  new world order governors beware or something i forget the
[2:42:15.720 --> 2:42:17.760]  exact headline
[2:42:17.760 --> 2:42:21.840]  maybe we can put that up on screen for people but uh... when somebody says are
[2:42:21.840 --> 2:42:26.440]  you going to lead us
[2:42:26.440 --> 2:42:29.520]  it's easy from your house to have
[2:42:29.520 --> 2:42:33.760]  ten or fifteen sycophants show up and call you
[2:42:33.760 --> 2:42:37.400]  the
[2:42:37.400 --> 2:42:41.040]  master and commander or the captain or the
[2:42:41.040 --> 2:42:42.520]  or the leader
[2:42:42.520 --> 2:42:47.720]  or the provincial leader or the uh... continental congress secretary or
[2:42:47.720 --> 2:42:50.880]  uh...
[2:42:50.880 --> 2:42:53.480]  what do they call all over cromwell what was
[2:42:53.480 --> 2:42:57.200]  what was his name uh...
[2:42:57.200 --> 2:43:00.760]  i gotta know that wikipedia all over cromwell
[2:43:00.760 --> 2:43:02.280]  it was uh...
[2:43:02.280 --> 2:43:05.080]  oh it's it's like a splinter in my mind i think i remember

[2:43:09.320 --> 2:43:12.480]  all over
[2:43:12.480 --> 2:43:17.040]  cromwell
[2:43:17.040 --> 2:43:21.080]  what was his term what was his name
[2:43:21.080 --> 2:43:24.800]  you know wikipedia has been exposed as a cia front for a reason
[2:43:24.800 --> 2:43:28.040]  always the first thing that comes up and it's riddled with this info
[2:43:28.040 --> 2:43:31.440]  but see i already have historical background knowledge so i'll it is
[2:43:31.440 --> 2:43:35.560]  just refresh my memory i'll know if this is accurate or not
[2:43:35.560 --> 2:43:37.720]  what was his
[2:43:37.720 --> 2:43:42.440]  now his name was not ironsides it was uh...
[2:43:42.440 --> 2:43:43.800]  that was like
[2:43:43.800 --> 2:43:48.600]  grand protector defender of the faith
[2:43:48.600 --> 2:43:54.280]  all this is driving me absolutely crazy
[2:43:54.280 --> 2:43:57.320]  you know it's it's not ironsides
[2:43:57.320 --> 2:44:00.920]  exactly that's why wikipedia is an absolute joke if it says that

[2:44:03.800 --> 2:44:06.200]  obsess over all that

[2:44:21.200 --> 2:44:21.960]  faith
[2:44:21.960 --> 2:44:24.760]  that's it lord protector
[2:44:24.760 --> 2:44:28.280]  i uh... unlike a lot of americans but like you i read
[2:44:28.280 --> 2:44:30.760]  and i'm a uh... student of history
[2:44:30.760 --> 2:44:34.760]  and uh... before i get to like all i've got a direct quote the other night i just
[2:44:34.760 --> 2:44:38.760]  happen to pull up on google i hadn't seen this movie in a long time
[2:44:38.760 --> 2:44:43.840]  and course you know i ht wells was a big globalist and a eugenicist
[2:44:43.840 --> 2:44:48.440]  uh... and uh... there's a movie i saw on tv several times when i was a kid and i
[2:44:48.440 --> 2:44:51.840]  happen to pull it up to the one to watch it on google it's called the time
[2:44:51.840 --> 2:44:52.680]  machine
[2:44:52.680 --> 2:44:56.800]  and i want to give you a direct direct quote from that movie that just blew me
[2:44:56.800 --> 2:45:01.040]  away when i heard it's based on uh... a ht wells
[2:45:01.040 --> 2:45:04.640]  but the time machine the topic genesis
[2:45:04.640 --> 2:45:09.240]  and uh... this is the nineteen sixty movie not the two remakes after that
[2:45:09.240 --> 2:45:12.640]  uh... but before i give you this quote i just want to say in response to a few
[2:45:12.640 --> 2:45:14.640]  cars earlier where he was
[2:45:14.640 --> 2:45:18.240]  basically you know trying to nicely criticize you for how you're being i
[2:45:18.240 --> 2:45:21.920]  want to say this not because i'm trying to defend you you don't need anybody to
[2:45:21.920 --> 2:45:23.280]  defend you
[2:45:23.280 --> 2:45:26.920]  because you've made it real clear this whole thing what you're doing it's not
[2:45:26.920 --> 2:45:31.160]  about alex jones it's about standing up just like the founding fathers for
[2:45:31.160 --> 2:45:32.320]  what's good
[2:45:32.320 --> 2:45:33.240]  and right
[2:45:33.240 --> 2:45:37.960]  and true i've been a christian for over thirty years i'm convinced of the truth
[2:45:37.960 --> 2:45:42.000]  of the word of god and so i stand for it because of that that i've gotten a lot
[2:45:42.000 --> 2:45:43.280]  of opposition
[2:45:43.280 --> 2:45:47.120]  and i've even had people accused me just like you've been of being mean
[2:45:47.120 --> 2:45:49.640]  spirited and cruel and
[2:45:49.640 --> 2:45:53.680]  uh... no not understanding insensitive unchristian et cetera
[2:45:53.680 --> 2:45:57.760]  and it's all a bunch of bull and this is what i want to say the guy i called in
[2:45:57.760 --> 2:46:00.760]  for people that just simply can't deal with
[2:46:00.760 --> 2:46:01.840]  the truth
[2:46:01.840 --> 2:46:06.280]  and don't have the same mindset of somebody who knows the truth and will
[2:46:06.280 --> 2:46:08.120]  not back down from it
[2:46:08.120 --> 2:46:11.160]  and i'll tell you i've listened to rush limbaugh
[2:46:11.160 --> 2:46:15.760]  and uh... you know savage and these other guys and i don't agree that these
[2:46:15.760 --> 2:46:17.680]  guys are coming around because
[2:46:17.680 --> 2:46:19.280]  they're still hooked
[2:46:19.280 --> 2:46:23.720]  on the very thing that you have found the most which is exposing the false
[2:46:23.720 --> 2:46:26.480]  left right paradigm they're still
[2:46:26.480 --> 2:46:29.520]  viewing obama like he's just a leftist liberal
[2:46:29.520 --> 2:46:30.760]  instead of
[2:46:30.760 --> 2:46:34.840]  seeing things from the point of view that you exposed in the obama
[2:46:34.840 --> 2:46:38.760]  it's all about world government it's all about offshore elites that own both
[2:46:38.760 --> 2:46:42.360]  parties and it's so illegitimate criminal that foreign banks
[2:46:42.360 --> 2:46:45.840]  have stolen twenty three point seven trillion in less than
[2:46:45.840 --> 2:46:47.040]  ten months
[2:46:47.040 --> 2:46:49.640]  and my god arrest them all instead
[2:46:49.640 --> 2:46:52.000]  they're setting up a police state i appreciate
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:53.240]  uh... your call
[2:46:53.240 --> 2:46:56.600]  it was good to uh... good to hear from you steve ronnie travis
[2:46:56.600 --> 2:47:01.240]  chris mattin others but i promise to get to this
[2:47:01.240 --> 2:47:06.480]  this is a video clip from fox news doctor mark seagull on rationing care
[2:47:06.480 --> 2:47:09.200]  in a way it's a form of eugenics he says
[2:47:09.200 --> 2:47:13.280]  well it's not in a way a form of eugenics it is eugenics
[2:47:13.280 --> 2:47:15.760]  that's what this whole system is
[2:47:15.760 --> 2:47:17.920]  we have an eleven hundred page textbook
[2:47:17.920 --> 2:47:19.680]  written by the
[2:47:19.680 --> 2:47:20.960]  president's chief
[2:47:20.960 --> 2:47:23.840]  science advisor the science are holding
[2:47:23.840 --> 2:47:27.760]  and the guy he co-authored the textbook with was the congressional advisor in
[2:47:27.760 --> 2:47:31.000]  the presidential advisor to bush
[2:47:31.000 --> 2:47:34.680]  i mean that these people run things that's what all this is for
[2:47:34.680 --> 2:47:39.240]  that's what their own documents say it's not my opinion people can say oh well
[2:47:39.240 --> 2:47:42.600]  that guy's a nut or that guy yells and screams how am i not supposed to yell
[2:47:42.600 --> 2:47:44.320]  and scream
[2:47:44.320 --> 2:47:47.760]  about i mean i mean again how do you yell and scream about football and
[2:47:47.760 --> 2:47:49.400]  baseball and track
[2:47:49.400 --> 2:47:51.560]  you get so upset if your people don't win
[2:47:51.560 --> 2:47:55.040]  and i don't say you're bad for getting upset about sports but this is a leaps
[2:47:55.040 --> 2:47:58.440]  poison in your water man
[2:47:58.440 --> 2:48:00.720]  on record
[2:48:00.720 --> 2:48:03.960]  a world government with the cps will take everyone's children
[2:48:03.960 --> 2:48:04.840]  at birth
[2:48:04.840 --> 2:48:07.280]  and they're setting it up
[2:48:07.280 --> 2:48:10.000]  and now they want to socialize health care so government
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:11.960]  control what health care you get and
[2:48:11.960 --> 2:48:13.760]  hundreds of new taxes and
[2:48:13.760 --> 2:48:18.520]  taxes on toilet paper we gave you the bill number and taxes on drinks and taxes
[2:48:18.520 --> 2:48:22.000]  on food and just total control
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:24.600]  it's happening now
[2:48:24.600 --> 2:48:27.960]  all these top pundits are admitting this is like the soviet union but it's
[2:48:27.960 --> 2:48:30.680]  for the bankers they're robbing us
[2:48:30.680 --> 2:48:32.280]  here's the clip
[2:48:32.280 --> 2:48:35.480]  meanwhile joining us live in the studio we got dr mark seagull uh... fox news
[2:48:35.480 --> 2:48:36.880]  medical contributor
[2:48:36.880 --> 2:48:41.960]  uh... doctor uh... yesterday the male clinic came out and said uh... this plan
[2:48:41.960 --> 2:48:45.520]  of the presidents is not good it's not going to be good for health care and i
[2:48:45.520 --> 2:48:46.720]  understand you
[2:48:46.720 --> 2:48:50.320]  are quitting the a m a i wrote about in the new york post i am quitting the a m
[2:48:50.320 --> 2:48:53.440]  a because the a m a does not represent us if they can come out
[2:48:53.440 --> 2:48:56.680]  in support of a plan that is going to put doctors under the bus
[2:48:56.680 --> 2:48:59.840]  first of all if there's going to end up being rationed care here which there
[2:48:59.840 --> 2:49:04.160]  will be if the government takes over and they make the decisions for us
[2:49:04.160 --> 2:49:06.960]  you know what that's going to do that's going to increase my liability
[2:49:06.960 --> 2:49:10.440]  not only want to be able to provide the services that i need to provide for my
[2:49:10.440 --> 2:49:11.200]  patients
[2:49:11.200 --> 2:49:14.560]  i'm still going to be responsible for it let the government take on a lot of
[2:49:14.560 --> 2:49:17.240]  stuff stop
[2:49:17.240 --> 2:49:19.200]  it'll be just like vaccine makers
[2:49:19.200 --> 2:49:24.200]  you'll be given total immunity now you cut the wrong leg offer let somebody die
[2:49:24.200 --> 2:49:25.360]  of staff
[2:49:25.360 --> 2:49:28.880]  care is going to just complete canada england they all come here
[2:49:28.880 --> 2:49:29.720]  you gotta wait
[2:49:29.720 --> 2:49:32.440]  sixteen eighteen months for a brain surgery that you'll die if you don't get
[2:49:32.440 --> 2:49:33.560]  it in three months
[2:49:33.560 --> 2:49:35.320]  you're above sixty you die
[2:49:35.320 --> 2:49:37.400]  these are you genesis
[2:49:37.400 --> 2:49:40.400]  this is about them having their way with us these are the folks that want to
[2:49:40.400 --> 2:49:43.160]  force medicare our water
[2:49:43.160 --> 2:49:44.520]  go ahead and keep playing
[2:49:44.520 --> 2:49:47.440]  said that if you are happy with your health care
[2:49:47.440 --> 2:49:51.560]  nothing's gonna change if you like yours you keep it the way it is is he lying
[2:49:51.560 --> 2:49:55.320]  he's disingenuous i'll tell you why because i know my own office is going
[2:49:55.320 --> 2:49:57.720]  to change is going to be more people trying to get in
[2:49:57.720 --> 2:50:01.080]  i'm gonna have less and less time to take care of them reimbursements to
[2:50:01.080 --> 2:50:04.800]  doctors and hospitals are being cut
[2:50:04.800 --> 2:50:07.720]  we're gonna come back and finish it back it up he's absolutely right
[2:50:07.720 --> 2:50:11.320]  they've already underbush and now obama federalized the data-keeping the
[2:50:11.320 --> 2:50:12.840]  upgrades the computers
[2:50:12.840 --> 2:50:16.480]  what procedures you can do if you take medicare medicaid
[2:50:16.480 --> 2:50:18.400]  that's why ron paul in his practice
[2:50:18.400 --> 2:50:22.000]  wouldn't take it because you go under their control this forces you to go
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:22.840]  under it
[2:50:22.840 --> 2:50:25.960]  even if you don't want it and puts in the system of control
[2:50:25.960 --> 2:50:29.520]  and uh... begins the rationing where if you're on the government system they
[2:50:29.520 --> 2:50:30.480]  ration you
[2:50:30.480 --> 2:50:33.120]  and then if you make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year they give
[2:50:33.120 --> 2:50:35.160]  you a five point four surcharge
[2:50:35.160 --> 2:50:38.360]  to pay for everybody else's which will then be eugenics
[2:50:38.360 --> 2:50:40.440]  so i want you to hear him say eugenics
[2:50:40.440 --> 2:50:42.640]  when we get back everything is eugenics
[2:50:42.640 --> 2:50:47.640]  eugenics eugenics eugenics eugenics eugenics eugenics eugenics eugenics eugenics
[2:50:47.640 --> 2:50:51.480]  eugenics eugenics did i tell you it's all about eugenics the world
[2:50:51.480 --> 2:50:54.600]  government's all about being able to force eugenics on you
[2:50:54.600 --> 2:50:58.880]  because i don't say it once i want to say it again it's about eugenics
[2:50:58.880 --> 2:51:01.360]  world government carry out eugenics
[2:51:01.360 --> 2:51:04.680]  when you hear the words water purification what comes to mind
[2:51:04.680 --> 2:51:08.680]  if it's burkey water purification systems this message is for you
[2:51:08.680 --> 2:51:12.320]  did you know that over sixty percent of municipal water contains fluoride
[2:51:12.320 --> 2:51:14.240]  at less than two cents per gallon

[2:55:18.520 --> 2:55:20.720]  this up to pranaki and he says yeah
[2:55:20.720 --> 2:55:22.840]  i'm not going to tell you where the money is
[2:55:22.840 --> 2:55:26.320]  i've got clip after clip after clip of this but they're all up on info wars
[2:55:26.320 --> 2:55:29.120]  dot com present planet dot com
[2:55:29.120 --> 2:55:33.800]  they're all over the web we're not going to play in the interest of time
[2:55:33.800 --> 2:55:37.200]  but uh... let's finish up this eugenics clip
[2:55:37.200 --> 2:55:40.600]  and they got us fighting over twenty thirty forty fifty billion a year over
[2:55:40.600 --> 2:55:41.320]  some
[2:55:41.320 --> 2:55:44.560]  health care for twenty percent of the public that's not insured
[2:55:44.560 --> 2:55:47.280]  and of course the insurance companies are lobbying to make you do this and they
[2:55:47.280 --> 2:55:48.720]  can jack up prices
[2:55:48.720 --> 2:55:51.920]  this is the beginning of the totally controlled economy where they control
[2:55:51.920 --> 2:55:55.280]  four gm chrysler all the businesses
[2:55:55.280 --> 2:55:57.320]  here it is where they say it's eugenics
[2:55:57.320 --> 2:55:59.360]  which is the truth
[2:55:59.360 --> 2:56:03.120]  he's disingenuous i'll tell you why because i know my own office is going
[2:56:03.120 --> 2:56:05.480]  to change there's going to be more people trying to get in
[2:56:05.480 --> 2:56:09.400]  i'm gonna have less and less time to take care of them reimbursements to doctors
[2:56:09.400 --> 2:56:13.480]  and hospitals are being cut if i'm being paid less i got to work faster that
[2:56:13.480 --> 2:56:17.720]  means i send more people for expensive tests he's going to try to cost cut
[2:56:17.720 --> 2:56:21.560]  which means he's going to ration care so he's going to tell me what i can
[2:56:21.560 --> 2:56:24.920]  order what i can and when you talk about rationing we were just talking to dick
[2:56:24.920 --> 2:56:29.080]  morris about this he's he's done some research and when you start rationing
[2:56:29.080 --> 2:56:32.280]  health care and it looks as if that could happen i mean if you got fifty
[2:56:32.280 --> 2:56:34.040]  million more people in the system
[2:56:34.040 --> 2:56:35.560]  and a certain number of doctors
[2:56:35.560 --> 2:56:38.280]  people are going to be in line you're gonna have to determine who gets the
[2:56:38.280 --> 2:56:39.960]  next treatment
[2:56:39.960 --> 2:56:43.800]  unfairly the elderly are the ones who are going to get shortchanged that's so
[2:56:43.800 --> 2:56:46.880]  true i mean in a way it's a form of eugenics all you're not good enough to
[2:56:46.880 --> 2:56:50.840]  live now look allison made a great point off the air which is some people we do
[2:56:50.840 --> 2:56:54.480]  overtreat at the last days of life but who do you want to make that decision the
[2:56:54.480 --> 2:56:58.280]  art of medicine is the doctor and the patient making it together not so that's
[2:56:58.280 --> 2:56:59.520]  it folks
[2:56:59.520 --> 2:57:01.060]  that's it
[2:57:01.060 --> 2:57:01.920]  and
[2:57:01.920 --> 2:57:06.400]  the elite don't want you to have access to your medical care they love the power
[2:57:06.400 --> 2:57:08.560]  of that it's going to come from the state
[2:57:08.560 --> 2:57:11.000]  and uh... it is in trouble
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:14.520]  but as they bankrupt things and then half the public doesn't have it
[2:57:14.520 --> 2:57:18.680]  then they'll say oh we've got to give health care
[2:57:18.680 --> 2:57:22.280]  and they'll compromise with just taking over part of the systems they can get all
[2:57:22.280 --> 2:57:23.440]  of it later
[2:57:23.440 --> 2:57:25.480]  that's why they're destroying the economy
[2:57:25.480 --> 2:57:29.000]  i saw video last night online of robert pasture the big
[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:31.200]  north american union head

[2:57:36.800 --> 2:57:40.400]  we're going to bring this system in
[2:57:40.400 --> 2:57:42.400]  it is certainly happening
[2:57:42.400 --> 2:57:43.800]  certainly going on

[3:01:06.000 --> 3:01:09.520]  before you get there and uh... i want to thank you for everything of course
[3:01:09.520 --> 3:01:13.760]  you're getting to speak with your guest wane paul with a special treat for me
[3:01:13.760 --> 3:01:17.600]  but i forgot i i i forgot to mention that
[3:01:17.600 --> 3:01:23.360]  the most important person of that paul family i spoke to was his granddaughter
[3:01:23.360 --> 3:01:27.120]  who approached me on the ut campus i was carrying one of his signs as usual and
[3:01:27.120 --> 3:01:30.560]  she again thanked me for caring for campaigning for him and
[3:01:30.560 --> 3:01:33.680]  she told me that she was of course delivered by him and then said
[3:01:33.680 --> 3:01:38.720]  and i'm his granddaughter so i've actually uh... and and i don't like you i
[3:01:38.720 --> 3:01:42.720]  think that it may be uh... maybe she she told dr paul about it and and like you
[3:01:42.720 --> 3:01:47.360]  maybe i helped him to decide to run again that's just maybe a delusion on my
[3:01:47.360 --> 3:01:52.240]  part but i do you also know ron paul's for real that's why co until pro attack
[3:01:52.240 --> 3:01:56.160]  him and ask and and and ask where's the the campaign
[3:01:56.160 --> 3:01:59.360]  money and this and that when it's all under the federal election commission
[3:01:59.360 --> 3:02:03.360]  public co until pros now attacking we are changed we are change isn't
[3:02:03.360 --> 3:02:08.000]  centralized it's just a name and idea that i promoted up front
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:11.520]  and exploded worldwide because the name was good
[3:02:11.520 --> 3:02:15.200]  and they're trying to attack the new york chapter because openly on the show
[3:02:15.200 --> 3:02:19.120]  you the listeners raise money uh... for
[3:02:19.120 --> 3:02:24.160]  uh... german talus who they ran the wheelchair into and set up he was found
[3:02:24.160 --> 3:02:27.440]  not guilty so that they're trying to spend that
[3:02:27.440 --> 3:02:32.800]  uh... but again it's not working and we're continuing to move forward and
[3:02:32.800 --> 3:02:35.120]  expose the new world order and the globalist
[3:02:35.120 --> 3:02:38.400]  absolutely hate it and we're going to bring him to justice so they love to
[3:02:38.400 --> 3:02:41.520]  nitpick on us all day but we're not the new world order
[3:02:41.520 --> 3:02:46.720]  we're not the new world order uh... that is forcing you to pay taxes so they
[3:02:46.720 --> 3:02:51.360]  can use it to poison your water and so the people are wise to that and we're
[3:02:51.360 --> 3:02:53.040]  going to bring down the globalist
[3:02:53.040 --> 3:02:56.800]  well you're right sir can i just say public quote from dr paul is most
[3:02:56.800 --> 3:03:00.560]  recent american repress last paragraph he said public
[3:03:00.560 --> 3:03:03.440]  outcry against the bank guy that be allowed to the government power grab
[3:03:03.440 --> 3:03:07.840]  known as cabin trade proves the spirit of liberty still lives
[3:03:07.840 --> 3:03:11.760]  and part of a celebration of independence they should include a renewed determination

[3:09:52.960 --> 3:09:56.640]  where is the economy you see revolutions coming
[3:09:56.640 --> 3:09:59.680]  the elite are stealing everything even nailed down
[3:09:59.680 --> 3:10:04.320]  gerald salente chief of the trends forecast institute there
[3:10:04.320 --> 3:10:06.880]  a trends research institute tell us what's happening
[3:10:06.880 --> 3:10:10.320]  well let's just we only stick by the facts as you well know and we're
[3:10:10.320 --> 3:10:13.120]  political atheists we don't believe in uh...
[3:10:13.120 --> 3:10:18.400]  in this two-headed one-party system we don't bow to politicians or
[3:10:18.400 --> 3:10:23.120]  genuflect at political altars only we only look at the facts
[3:10:23.120 --> 3:10:28.560]  we just heard vice president biden and last week a week and a half ago say
[3:10:28.560 --> 3:10:31.920]  that that no one uh... the truth is
[3:10:31.920 --> 3:10:36.240]  we and everyone else misread the economy that's his quote
[3:10:36.240 --> 3:10:40.160]  and well the truth is either he's ignorant and all of those
[3:10:40.160 --> 3:10:44.240]  phd's and credentialed people in the white house are ignorant
[3:10:44.240 --> 3:10:47.280]  or else they're so arrogant that they can only see
[3:10:47.280 --> 3:10:51.200]  outside the beltway or it can't see outside the beltway and think that
[3:10:51.200 --> 3:10:55.040]  they're the only people that know anything or else they're lying to us
[3:10:55.040 --> 3:10:59.760]  those are the only three options because the truth is you well know we saw it
[3:10:59.760 --> 3:11:05.040]  and so did uh... some others and so all we're doing is we're looking at the
[3:11:05.040 --> 3:11:08.800]  facts alex and the facts are that the obama
[3:11:08.800 --> 3:11:12.400]  administration said that seven hundred eighty seven billion
[3:11:12.400 --> 3:11:17.680]  dollar bailout scheme was going to create six hundred thousand new jobs
[3:11:17.680 --> 3:11:22.800]  by this time and they said that without the stimulus package
[3:11:22.800 --> 3:11:26.320]  we would see unemployment hit eight percent
[3:11:26.320 --> 3:11:30.560]  in two thousand and nine and peak at nine percent
[3:11:30.560 --> 3:11:34.800]  in two thousand and ten that's what they said
[3:11:34.800 --> 3:11:38.560]  now we have unemployment already official unemployment
[3:11:38.560 --> 3:11:42.640]  at nine point five percent so they're way off on that
[3:11:42.640 --> 3:11:47.840]  how could they have any credibility we've lost two point five million jobs
[3:11:47.840 --> 3:11:53.680]  since obama has become president and at very best if you're going to be generous
[3:11:53.680 --> 3:11:56.880]  they spent twenty percent of the stimulus package
[3:11:56.880 --> 3:12:01.840]  and created at best a hundred fifty thousand new jobs
[3:12:01.840 --> 3:12:06.400]  so when you extrapolate this forward the best they can do
[3:12:06.400 --> 3:12:10.320]  is come up with about seven hundred seven hundred fifty thousand new jobs
[3:12:10.320 --> 3:12:14.960]  over two and a half years whereby they said they were going to create
[3:12:14.960 --> 3:12:19.360]  between three point five and four million jobs
[3:12:19.360 --> 3:12:23.680]  and to wit we've already lost seven point two million
[3:12:23.680 --> 3:12:29.520]  since this recession quote officially began
[3:12:29.520 --> 3:12:34.000]  gerald i was looking at a u.s. say today
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:38.720]  finance gallup poll and it showed how obama got elected
[3:12:38.720 --> 3:12:41.520]  at an eighty three eighty four depending on which
[3:12:41.520 --> 3:12:44.800]  which one of the graphs they've had several these gallup polls
[3:12:44.800 --> 3:12:49.360]  and now he's dropped below fifties but in some demographics below fifty
[3:12:49.360 --> 3:12:56.720]  that is a faster steeper uh further decline than the previous grand
[3:12:56.720 --> 3:13:02.640]  champion loser uh the peanut farmer from georgia
[3:13:02.640 --> 3:13:06.240]  back in the seventies jimmy carter and so
[3:13:06.240 --> 3:13:10.560]  the bigger the hype the bigger they are the the harder they fall
[3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:14.560]  people are finding out it was total betrayal total crap
[3:13:14.560 --> 3:13:18.160]  uh george bush after jimmy carter and obama is the third
[3:13:18.160 --> 3:13:22.160]  fastest to fall but luckily a magic crises
[3:13:22.160 --> 3:13:26.480]  popped up nine months in to kind of boost bush for a while
[3:13:26.480 --> 3:13:31.360]  but but but minus a stage crises or provocation or war
[3:13:31.360 --> 3:13:36.560]  obama is a political dead duck and his entire agenda the seas america
[3:13:36.560 --> 3:13:39.840]  is failing uh but does he have an ace
[3:13:39.840 --> 3:13:42.720]  up his sleeve is it the crisis is going to be so bad
[3:13:42.720 --> 3:13:45.920]  we all can only swim to the life raft of the federal government
[3:13:45.920 --> 3:13:49.280]  even if it's a desert island you know covered with
[3:13:49.280 --> 3:13:55.200]  government zombies or is it a new war is it a stage terror attack
[3:13:55.200 --> 3:13:59.760]  i mean if he's in total freefall the worst in the last hundred years of
[3:13:59.760 --> 3:14:03.840]  of polling with presidents what does this mean i think you're one of the most
[3:14:03.840 --> 3:14:07.200]  astute people out there talking about this in the way that you're talking
[3:14:07.200 --> 3:14:11.200]  about it because we saw the exact same things as well
[3:14:11.200 --> 3:14:15.040]  and that when you look at the freefall that he's had in the polls and you
[3:14:15.040 --> 3:14:19.840]  compare it as to carter and then the bush was one percentage point higher
[3:14:19.840 --> 3:14:24.720]  summer came uh bush was down in the dumps people were making fun of him
[3:14:24.720 --> 3:14:27.840]  for taking a month long vacation to grow up at texas
[3:14:27.840 --> 3:14:31.840]  as the economy was sinking remember we were just getting we were just being
[3:14:31.840 --> 3:14:37.440]  hit by the dot com bubble burst and all of a sudden there was nine eleven
[3:14:37.440 --> 3:14:42.880]  so these people come up with schemes undreamed of or things can just happen
[3:14:42.880 --> 3:14:46.240]  one of the things that we're watching very closely
[3:14:46.240 --> 3:14:50.960]  is that the the obama administration is held back in releasing budget
[3:14:50.960 --> 3:14:53.680]  projections that was supposed to come out
[3:14:53.680 --> 3:14:56.720]  within a week and now they're going to come out with them
[3:14:56.720 --> 3:15:01.760]  after after uh congress takes its recess in august
[3:15:01.760 --> 3:15:05.360]  that's a big signal to us so we're looking at that
[3:15:05.360 --> 3:15:09.840]  very very closely because they may be the shock of our lifetime in those
[3:15:09.840 --> 3:15:13.280]  numbers no one's talking anymore about the green
[3:15:13.280 --> 3:15:17.760]  shoots remember that load of malarkey that they were spreading around
[3:15:17.760 --> 3:15:22.240]  that money manure that was supposed to be pushing up the economy
[3:15:22.240 --> 3:15:26.080]  so that's the kind of thing that we're looking for anything could happen
[3:15:26.080 --> 3:15:32.080]  they come up with schemes undreamed of but the reality is in the final sense
[3:15:32.080 --> 3:15:36.480]  is that as we've been saying we're going the world is going to call it
[3:15:36.480 --> 3:15:43.360]  the greatest depression in america it's going to be called obama dead
[3:15:43.360 --> 3:15:47.920]  the schemes that they've come up with these bailouts buyouts rescue packages
[3:15:47.920 --> 3:15:52.320]  us owning corrupt country companies like city group
[3:15:52.320 --> 3:15:56.960]  and and and general motors i love it general motors they protect this guy
[3:15:56.960 --> 3:16:01.120]  lutz who is the vice chairman of general motors
[3:16:01.120 --> 3:16:06.240]  this is a genius alex that came out in 2005 2006
[3:16:06.240 --> 3:16:09.840]  that said that anyone that thinks that high gasoline prices

[3:18:12.960 --> 3:18:16.800]  wave ever to hit america was sweeping across the nation
[3:18:16.800 --> 3:18:22.400]  more lawless than the wild west better organized in gangland chicago
[3:18:22.400 --> 3:18:27.840]  a ruthless mob of financial bandits and political wise guys
[3:18:27.840 --> 3:18:31.680]  had taken control of the united states of america

[3:18:35.280 --> 3:18:39.520]  committing world-class crimes but all carried out
[3:18:39.520 --> 3:18:43.920]  under the cover of law if perpetrated by individuals
[3:18:43.920 --> 3:18:47.440]  it would have been called robbery extortion
[3:18:47.440 --> 3:18:52.080]  embezzlement and fraud and the perpetrators would have been indicted
[3:18:52.080 --> 3:18:57.280]  hold into court and brought to justice but because politicians and financiers
[3:18:57.280 --> 3:19:03.840]  were committing the crimes it was just called legislation

[3:24:24.480 --> 3:24:27.920]  but just as fast i felt brand new
[3:24:27.920 --> 3:24:31.200]  for you
[3:24:31.200 --> 3:24:34.720]  i look at you
[3:24:35.280 --> 3:24:38.160]  all right carol salenta going right back to your calls coming up the next
[3:24:38.160 --> 3:24:41.440]  segment when you say this is the greatest
[3:24:41.440 --> 3:24:43.440]  highest in history i don't think people understand
[3:24:43.440 --> 3:24:49.040]  you really mean that 23.7 trillion and they're
[3:24:49.040 --> 3:24:52.240]  grabbing every sector of the economy and the green tax
[3:24:52.240 --> 3:24:55.280]  the carbon tax allows the bureaucracy i have the bill
[3:24:55.280 --> 3:24:59.360]  but they passed in secret now public as you know i want your take on that
[3:24:59.360 --> 3:25:04.480]  allows federal agencies to raise taxes on toilet paper beef
[3:25:04.480 --> 3:25:08.720]  uh play everything i mean this this is government becoming god
[3:25:08.720 --> 3:25:12.800]  you call that fascism don't you go ahead well the merger of state and
[3:25:12.800 --> 3:25:16.400]  corporate powers according to musolini
[3:25:16.400 --> 3:25:21.120]  is called fascism so if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck
[3:25:21.120 --> 3:25:25.120]  let's call it a spade a spade it's fascism
[3:25:25.120 --> 3:25:28.640]  and and to pick up on the second part of what you were saying
[3:25:28.640 --> 3:25:32.800]  and i was saying was at first they went through this whole scheme of the
[3:25:32.800 --> 3:25:36.960]  of the money printing well that's going to run out as we're seeing now
[3:25:36.960 --> 3:25:40.560]  with the diving of the dollar and other currencies looking for
[3:25:40.560 --> 3:25:44.000]  other countries looking for new reserve currency
[3:25:44.000 --> 3:25:50.800]  so the next theme is to tax the people to death and whether it's hassle
[3:25:50.800 --> 3:25:54.160]  taxes again current events form future trends
[3:25:54.160 --> 3:25:58.800]  pick up today's usa today look at the parking tax
[3:25:58.800 --> 3:26:03.360]  ticket numbers that they're putting out there but if you jay walk they'll give
[3:26:03.360 --> 3:26:08.400]  you a ticket spit on the street but rob the country blind
[3:26:08.400 --> 3:26:13.440]  you can get an award for it or they'll make you a treasury secretary
[3:26:13.440 --> 3:26:18.720]  so the scheme alex is after the printing game runs out
[3:26:18.720 --> 3:26:24.320]  it's the tax to death game and and this whole thing this whole notion
[3:26:24.320 --> 3:26:28.160]  of too big to fail who came up with that one
[3:26:28.160 --> 3:26:32.640]  i can say with full authority that their mother's not better than mine
[3:26:32.640 --> 3:26:37.440]  what would happen if they failed no one's ever told us
[3:26:37.440 --> 3:26:41.920]  but yet we hear from henry the don paulson
[3:26:41.920 --> 3:26:45.840]  at the last house oversight meeting saying quote
[3:26:45.840 --> 3:26:50.160]  our response our responses were not perfect
[3:26:50.160 --> 3:26:54.400]  but i am confident that they were substantially correct
[3:26:54.400 --> 3:26:57.920]  and that they save this country from great peril
[3:26:57.920 --> 3:27:02.240]  oh look at how this psychology works they can rape they can steal they can
[3:27:02.240 --> 3:27:05.520]  steal trillions they engineered the crisis on record
[3:27:05.520 --> 3:27:08.880]  and then they're the savior and if you don't give them what they want
[3:27:08.880 --> 3:27:11.760]  they'll declare martial law as paulson threatened
[3:27:11.760 --> 3:27:15.280]  last year now there's been articles in the news as you know jerald
[3:27:15.280 --> 3:27:18.160]  saying how good it was he threatened martial law
[3:27:18.160 --> 3:27:21.840]  and how he's above the law and how the private federal reserve
[3:27:21.840 --> 3:27:25.680]  is above the law they're you know the president isn't the congress isn't
[3:27:25.680 --> 3:27:30.400]  the courts aren't but they are because they're the eddy haskell bankers
[3:27:30.400 --> 3:27:34.640]  and they're more than that as i said they're the wall street mafia
[3:27:34.640 --> 3:27:40.960]  it's henry the don paulson you read the new york times he bullied congress
[3:27:40.960 --> 3:27:46.160]  bully congress what do you mean bully who is this guy to bully congress
[3:27:46.160 --> 3:27:53.200]  oh and there's jamie legs diamond from uh jp morgan and and there's uh
[3:27:53.200 --> 3:27:57.440]  who's that guy from a city group that would put this whole
[3:27:57.440 --> 3:28:04.720]  grand scheme together sandy greedy pig wild now let's call them who they are
[3:28:04.720 --> 3:28:08.800]  they're robbing this nation blind and the people
[3:28:08.800 --> 3:28:12.400]  are either drug dealers became we've gone
[3:28:12.400 --> 3:28:20.000]  we have gone from the home of the brave to what happened to this country
[3:28:20.000 --> 3:28:26.880]  that that we have become so subservient and and and and so uh federally
[3:28:26.880 --> 3:28:32.400]  dictated we're not free and we're not brave as a nation you know people can
[3:28:32.400 --> 3:28:37.040]  make fun of the french all they want but boy the french got it down
[3:28:37.040 --> 3:28:40.480]  look what happened when that company was trying to
[3:28:40.480 --> 3:28:43.440]  shaft the employees out of their severance pay
[3:28:43.440 --> 3:28:47.840]  you know they tried to blow the place up and all the equipment in it
[3:28:47.840 --> 3:28:51.440]  when they do bore snappings these are the people that brought us off with their
[3:28:51.440 --> 3:28:54.880]  heads they know what it's like to be living under
[3:28:54.880 --> 3:28:59.280]  tyrannical government where they say let them eat bread

[3:33:18.640 --> 3:33:23.040]  back to him but during the break the last
[3:33:23.040 --> 3:33:27.120]  break before last about 10 minutes ago
[3:33:27.120 --> 3:33:32.720]  i um called ted up the owner of genesis and minus resources and i said do you
[3:33:32.720 --> 3:33:39.200]  have any of that gold and silver left from when gold was 900 bucks an ounce
[3:33:39.200 --> 3:33:43.200]  and when silver was a dollar less and he said yes we're almost out of it
[3:33:43.200 --> 3:33:46.720]  but we have the very tail end so this is the last
[3:33:46.720 --> 3:33:50.000]  gold up over 40 plus dollars from that point
[3:33:50.000 --> 3:33:53.520]  silver way up and this is the very end of the Lakotas
[3:33:53.520 --> 3:33:57.680]  the francs the sovereigns and some other coins Ted Anderson has
[3:33:57.680 --> 3:34:02.160]  right now until midnight tonight uh ted that's as long as you can hold it
[3:34:02.160 --> 3:34:05.200]  correct well i mean i've already read the price on the
[3:34:05.200 --> 3:34:08.480]  internet has already gone up if you go to our web offers you'll find that the
[3:34:08.480 --> 3:34:13.600]  Lakotas are in the 19 dollar range where these are still sitting at that 18
[3:34:13.600 --> 3:34:18.240]  dollars and 17 cents so yeah that is a really good buy
[3:34:18.240 --> 3:34:22.400]  the reason why i was able to put them up there is i had about 900 of them
[3:34:22.400 --> 3:34:25.680]  left in my inventory although some of those are spoken for already we haven't
[3:34:25.680 --> 3:34:29.840]  received the checks from people but i will hold it at that price but then
[3:34:29.840 --> 3:34:34.880]  come tomorrow it's like 19 dollars and 17 cents i can't remember exactly what
[3:34:34.880 --> 3:34:38.000]  the number was okay so so the Lakotas are going up what
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:40.960]  about gold at the lower price when you bought it at
[3:34:40.960 --> 3:34:45.440]  900 905 well that is obviously just a steal
[3:34:45.440 --> 3:34:49.360]  if i ever heard of one i mean you have still right now the francs
[3:34:49.360 --> 3:34:55.200]  sitting at 216 dollars a coin the british sovereign is at 266
[3:34:55.200 --> 3:34:58.720]  both of those coins have gone up in price i don't put them on our internet
[3:34:58.720 --> 3:35:03.520]  site but they all are up in you know up in price because of the fact that gold
[3:35:03.520 --> 3:35:08.320]  was trading at 913 when i locked him in at this level currently right now
[3:35:08.320 --> 3:35:11.120]  today's spot price ago the last time i've looked
[3:35:11.120 --> 3:35:17.600]  was 951 60 it's been as high as 950 net 590 already today so yeah there's yeah
[3:35:17.600 --> 3:35:20.400]  and to simplify this folks for people that understand
[3:35:20.400 --> 3:35:23.440]  you bought this golden silver when the market
[3:35:23.440 --> 3:35:28.320]  two or three weeks ago was in gold almost 50 dollars lower than it is now
[3:35:28.320 --> 3:35:31.280]  and in silver over a dollar lower than it is now
[3:35:31.280 --> 3:35:34.880]  so you're selling out of these stores you have you're almost down
[3:35:34.880 --> 3:35:38.320]  and instead of raising your prices when gold and silver goes up that's how you
[3:35:38.320 --> 3:35:41.040]  should make a profit you know we're capitalists we're not
[3:35:41.040 --> 3:35:45.200]  communists you're passing those savings on but this
[3:35:45.200 --> 3:35:49.360]  is the end this is the last time ted correct it is the end of this i can tell
[3:35:49.360 --> 3:35:52.560]  you right now alex i placed an order today for 5000 more
[3:35:52.560 --> 3:35:55.520]  Lakota's and the price is much higher than what i'm
[3:35:55.520 --> 3:35:59.520]  offering right now so i can't do that and is this the end for the gold
[3:35:59.520 --> 3:36:03.200]  is this the end for the gold the gold is still they're both the same
[3:36:03.200 --> 3:36:07.200]  same thing i mean the gold is i mean i'm lucky to be able to carry it through
[3:36:07.200 --> 3:36:11.040]  midnight i will just because i'll lose some money on some of the deals
[3:36:11.040 --> 3:36:15.360]  but okay so you're almost completely out one eight hundred six eight six two two

[3:36:55.440 --> 3:37:00.080]  hundred six eight six two two three seven ted thank you so

[3:37:02.640 --> 3:37:06.080]  going back to gerald salento i appreciate holding the website again
[3:37:06.080 --> 3:37:10.240]  uh we'll put up on screen for you right now for folks
[3:37:10.240 --> 3:37:14.560]  watching at prismplanet.tv trendsresearch.com
[3:37:14.560 --> 3:37:17.600]  gerald i'm just going to throw this at you in the cold i don't even know what
[3:37:17.600 --> 3:37:21.440]  your view is on this particularly what do you think of people getting out of
[3:37:21.440 --> 3:37:27.200]  paper and moving partially into silver or gold is that a generally a smart idea
[3:37:27.200 --> 3:37:31.360]  well we don't give investment advice but i can tell you that i'm 80 percent
[3:37:31.360 --> 3:37:36.880]  invested in gold and i keep buying it and my strategy by the way is that i
[3:37:36.880 --> 3:37:40.640]  also hedge my currencies in the sense that i'll own
[3:37:40.640 --> 3:37:45.120]  dollars but i'll also own euros one goes up the other goes down
[3:37:45.120 --> 3:37:48.960]  that i just want parity uh to keep what i have
[3:37:48.960 --> 3:37:54.160]  this is well about wealth preservation and to us gold is the wild card but
[3:37:54.160 --> 3:37:57.520]  having said that as you you may or may not know
[3:37:57.520 --> 3:38:03.760]  in our 2000 december 2001 we had said that gold prices had
[3:38:03.760 --> 3:38:07.520]  bottomed and we've been bullish on gold since
[3:38:07.520 --> 3:38:12.960]  and we're predicting in our forecast of gold 2000
[3:38:12.960 --> 3:38:17.520]  really go uh do you have an idea when no it's hard to tell because as you well
[3:38:17.520 --> 3:38:21.120]  know these markets are being highly manipulated
[3:38:21.120 --> 3:38:26.560]  and around the world people are bailing out of bucks as we spoke about earlier
[3:38:26.560 --> 3:38:30.320]  and they're looking for a new reserve currency i mentioned earlier
[3:38:30.320 --> 3:38:33.840]  that the obama administration is holding out coming out with their budget
[3:38:33.840 --> 3:38:37.680]  projections waiting until the dead heat of summer
[3:38:37.680 --> 3:38:41.920]  when everyone's in a vacation state of mind and congress isn't there
[3:38:41.920 --> 3:38:46.560]  so there can be some very earth shaking developments that are going to rattle
[3:38:46.560 --> 3:38:50.240]  the dollar so it could happen at any time but always
[3:38:50.240 --> 3:38:54.320]  remember that the game is going to be manipulated
[3:38:54.320 --> 3:38:58.560]  because once the world wakes up to the idea
[3:38:58.560 --> 3:39:01.680]  that their fiat currencies aren't going to be worth
[3:39:01.680 --> 3:39:06.080]  the paper they're printed on is going to be a huge run to gold
[3:39:06.080 --> 3:39:11.760]  another very important aspect is only one member of the g20 out there
[3:39:11.760 --> 3:39:16.880]  that's really criticizing america for its stimulus recovery
[3:39:16.880 --> 3:39:24.000]  bailout and buyout and why because of gold issues
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:29.280]  and they know what it's like these are the people the weimar republic
[3:39:29.280 --> 3:39:33.280]  they still have the people alive that told the stories
[3:39:33.280 --> 3:39:37.280]  of going to a supermarket with a wheelbarrow of money
[3:39:37.280 --> 3:39:42.400]  and they know how it happened because they printed fan for money out of thin
[3:39:42.400 --> 3:39:46.480]  air based on nothing and producing practically nothing
[3:39:46.480 --> 3:39:52.800]  so that's why we're bullish on gold but the bankers to kill hyper inflation
[3:39:52.800 --> 3:39:57.120]  aren't just loaning the money so instead you have everything imploding
[3:39:57.120 --> 3:40:00.960]  while they print fiat to buy up real infrastructure
[3:40:00.960 --> 3:40:03.920]  and then from the experts we've talked to honestly if you agree with them with
[3:40:03.920 --> 3:40:08.000]  the general economists we've had on that then later the hyper inflation
[3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:14.320]  comes as an added nightmare over a depression economy the untold
[3:40:14.320 --> 3:40:19.600]  superstorm or perfect storm of hyper stag inflation
[3:40:19.600 --> 3:40:22.880]  yeah that's very true and depression actually hyper inflation
[3:40:22.880 --> 3:40:27.680]  and depression look at the numbers you will know depending on who you talk to
[3:40:27.680 --> 3:40:31.200]  the effective unemployment rate is 18.7 percent
[3:40:31.200 --> 3:40:35.360]  others are saying the unofficial rate is 20 percent
[3:40:35.360 --> 3:40:38.720]  so that's what we're really looking at people going they see these kids going
[3:40:38.720 --> 3:40:41.520]  to college we're going to get jobs doing what
[3:40:41.520 --> 3:40:44.480]  that's what i was about to say that the you were saying the next big bubble is
[3:40:44.480 --> 3:40:48.240]  the college bubble they're going into debt now for jobs that aren't even going
[3:40:48.240 --> 3:40:52.000]  to exist and the commercial real estate as you said in the show
[3:40:52.000 --> 3:40:55.440]  year and a half ago starting to implode they're saying that's the next big one
[3:40:55.440 --> 3:40:59.120]  give us some of those trends but going back to gold because we've
[3:40:59.120 --> 3:41:02.080]  interviewed so many experts who are bullish or bearish on gold
[3:41:02.080 --> 3:41:06.560]  but all of them acknowledge that everybody should be partially in gold
[3:41:06.560 --> 3:41:12.160]  and silvered as a hedge against inflation as an emergency parachute to
[3:41:12.160 --> 3:41:16.000]  just protect wealth to make sure you've got something that can't be
[3:41:16.000 --> 3:41:19.920]  dissipated overnight like paper but that's spectacularly
[3:41:19.920 --> 3:41:23.280]  it's also the biggest boon is speculative because if the dollar
[3:41:23.280 --> 3:41:26.320]  does implode or other major currencies who were they're all over printing right
[3:41:26.320 --> 3:41:29.520]  now as you know that's kind of their answer is global inflation
[3:41:29.520 --> 3:41:33.840]  kind of a parody that gold could go to three four thousand
[3:41:33.840 --> 3:41:40.160]  well it can it really can you know they keep and then if there's war on top of
[3:41:40.160 --> 3:41:44.400]  this because who knows they keep talking about bombing
[3:41:44.400 --> 3:41:48.640]  iran israel does or invading them at some level
[3:41:48.640 --> 3:41:54.400]  and we've said from from the onset that if any if the united states or israel
[3:41:54.400 --> 3:41:58.320]  attack iran it's the beginning of world war three
[3:41:58.320 --> 3:42:01.440]  because then you're going to start seeing oil prices
[3:42:01.440 --> 3:42:05.120]  go to the stratosphere along with gold prices
[3:42:05.120 --> 3:42:10.880]  so there are so many wild cards out there that make for us gold a
[3:42:10.880 --> 3:42:14.720]  a better forecast to go up than to go down
[3:42:14.720 --> 3:42:19.280]  i mean what could be the downside of gold a gold could we as we see could only
[3:42:19.280 --> 3:42:23.120]  go down if the unemployment rate in the united states
[3:42:23.120 --> 3:42:28.800]  goes back to four point five percent we wipe out our trade deficits our budget
[3:42:28.800 --> 3:42:32.400]  deficits and that's highly unlikely and you're physically
[3:42:32.400 --> 3:42:36.240]  holding it you can dump out of it if it starts going down or you can wait till it
[3:42:36.240 --> 3:42:39.120]  goes back up the next time i have to tell you i have to tell you something
[3:42:39.120 --> 3:42:42.960]  this is very important i i've been buying gold for a long time
[3:42:42.960 --> 3:42:47.120]  and i you know in life you have ups and downs you know let's not be you know
[3:42:47.120 --> 3:42:50.960]  fake about this and i've had lean years in my life
[3:42:50.960 --> 3:42:57.280]  what saved me was having gold because as you well know you know it's
[3:42:57.280 --> 3:43:01.200]  getting rid of gold cashing in gold isn't as easy
[3:43:01.200 --> 3:43:05.920]  as writing a check so you really have to think twice and three times and four
[3:43:05.920 --> 3:43:09.120]  times before you want to load that gold
[3:43:09.120 --> 3:43:15.840]  and so you hold on to that store wealth of of that store that base of wealth
[3:43:15.840 --> 3:43:19.680]  without writing a check off to go spend it or to pay it
[3:43:19.680 --> 3:43:24.160]  debt and what i also did with my gold is i used it
[3:43:24.160 --> 3:43:30.960]  as collateral to borrow knowing that i wanted that gold back and i never had
[3:43:30.960 --> 3:43:34.640]  any problem loaning money borrowing money privately
[3:43:34.640 --> 3:43:39.840]  having that as a backdrop so i'm a firm believer in gold
[3:43:39.840 --> 3:43:43.120]  it's good as gold is the same i just wanted to bring that up because
[3:43:43.120 --> 3:43:46.080]  everything else is performing like hell right now
[3:43:46.080 --> 3:43:49.360]  treasuries almost have no yield everybody's running to them
[3:43:49.360 --> 3:43:54.000]  uh and it's just an amazing scam we're witnessing i i i want to go to calls
[3:43:54.000 --> 3:43:57.840]  for jerry solante here in just a moment in the time we have left but jerry
[3:43:57.840 --> 3:44:01.600]  how do you see well well two questions before i forget first
[3:44:01.600 --> 3:44:06.320]  the flu hype killed maybe 200 people worldwide they're talking about global
[3:44:06.320 --> 3:44:09.440]  force inoculations is this the global world trade
[3:44:09.440 --> 3:44:12.960]  organization world health organization cover
[3:44:12.960 --> 3:44:17.920]  to bring in control why are they saying oh it's all over in the fall they're the
[3:44:17.920 --> 3:44:22.080]  ones fair mongering in government a and then b
[3:44:22.080 --> 3:44:26.320]  is that kind of a backdrop if they need to suppress revolution
[3:44:26.320 --> 3:44:30.640]  they'll just hype up fear about flu and then people stand down because that
[3:44:30.640 --> 3:44:35.120]  that was said of of mexico what they're doing and why we don't know
[3:44:35.120 --> 3:44:39.120]  and we're not on the inside but i will tell you what we're forecasting
[3:44:39.120 --> 3:44:43.040]  and we're forecasting that there's going to be something
[3:44:43.040 --> 3:44:47.360]  and it's going to be calling it the new black plague and it's going to be real
[3:44:47.360 --> 3:44:51.360]  you can't put poison in your food in the air
[3:44:51.360 --> 3:44:56.560]  and in the water you can't dump dicky he just can't keep poisoning the host
[3:44:56.560 --> 3:45:00.640]  without causing a host of problems so there's going to be something
[3:45:00.640 --> 3:45:04.160]  that breaks down the immune systems is this really it
[3:45:04.160 --> 3:45:08.000]  probably not are the drug companies going to benefit from anything that
[3:45:08.000 --> 3:45:13.200]  happens absolutely will they use something like this
[3:45:13.200 --> 3:45:17.600]  as the false flag to declare martial law
[3:45:17.600 --> 3:45:21.040]  and to take the people that will once the
[3:45:21.040 --> 3:45:28.240]  home of the free and the brave into federal dictate and to subservience
[3:45:28.240 --> 3:45:32.000]  yes they could very well use something like that
[3:45:32.000 --> 3:45:37.600]  as a scare tactic and look i mean bush use the most effective one that i've
[3:45:37.600 --> 3:45:42.960]  seen in my lifetime with the war on terror
[3:45:42.960 --> 3:45:47.360]  absolutely and then they've got the continuing imploding economy uh i mean
[3:45:47.360 --> 3:45:50.320]  people have to go to the government from help through that and then now they're
[3:45:50.320 --> 3:45:53.200]  announcing he's breaking all his promises he's
[3:45:53.200 --> 3:45:55.600]  going to raise health care taxes on everybody and
[3:45:55.600 --> 3:46:01.920]  sur taxes and green taxes uh on on everybody's electricity i mean
[3:46:01.920 --> 3:46:06.560]  would you say obama wins or is a contender for the crown
[3:46:06.560 --> 3:46:10.240]  of the biggest liar because i thought clinton was a liar i thought bush was a
[3:46:10.240 --> 3:46:13.600]  liar but i thought the thing that we put obama in
[3:46:13.600 --> 3:46:19.360]  is the mass destruction of what was once the entrepreneurial empire
[3:46:19.360 --> 3:46:23.840]  into what musulini said the merger of state and corporate powers into
[3:46:23.840 --> 3:46:27.840]  fascism where government and major corporations
[3:46:27.840 --> 3:46:32.320]  are running the whole show again you know it look at the people look at the
[3:46:32.320 --> 3:46:36.240]  banks look at the control and so that's what we see
[3:46:36.240 --> 3:46:39.920]  and by the way people ask us what are some of the solutions
[3:46:39.920 --> 3:46:44.720]  well here's one solution we don't need wall street
[3:46:44.720 --> 3:46:51.040]  we need main street we don't need walmart's we need mom and pops
[3:46:51.040 --> 3:46:56.640]  we don't need agribusiness we need family farms
[3:46:56.640 --> 3:47:03.040]  we don't need monsanto we need organic and this is not hyperbole
[3:47:03.040 --> 3:47:09.680]  it's a fact a fact based on the knowledge that we were the united states of
[3:47:09.680 --> 3:47:14.240]  america the most egalitarian nation on earth
[3:47:14.240 --> 3:47:19.120]  respected and envied by everyone else on earth
[3:47:19.120 --> 3:47:23.760]  from the most egalitarian when that model existed
[3:47:23.760 --> 3:47:28.240]  main street mom and pop family farm and organic
[3:47:28.240 --> 3:47:33.280]  we have now become the nation where the gap between the rich and the poor is
[3:47:33.280 --> 3:47:36.800]  the widest of any of the industrialized nations
[3:47:36.800 --> 3:47:41.600]  and where we used to be number one in health care and education and
[3:47:41.600 --> 3:47:46.160]  longevity in quality of life when we lived by
[3:47:46.160 --> 3:47:50.960]  main street mom and pop family farms and organic
[3:47:50.960 --> 3:47:57.360]  we no longer win place or show by any of those indices
[3:47:57.360 --> 3:48:01.440]  because we're mentally and spiritually poisoned and the establishment
[3:48:01.440 --> 3:48:05.840]  knew that and all of those big vertically integrated corporate
[3:48:05.840 --> 3:48:09.120]  structures are waging war against mom and pop
[3:48:09.120 --> 3:48:12.640]  and main street and now they've got the animal ID the premises ID
[3:48:12.640 --> 3:48:16.560]  openly to shut down family farms and ranches the clean water restoration
[3:48:16.560 --> 3:48:20.320]  act to federalize all the water i mean they're coming in as the economy
[3:48:20.320 --> 3:48:23.840]  implodes trying to pass the carbon tax knowing it'll shut
[3:48:23.840 --> 3:48:28.800]  things down further this is the like the global mafia burning us out
[3:48:28.800 --> 3:48:32.960]  what so you're saying the revolution isn't just physical it's going to be
[3:48:32.960 --> 3:48:36.400]  people not going to walmart anymore people planning their own gardens
[3:48:36.400 --> 3:48:40.320]  people not doing what the local thugs and feds say
[3:48:40.320 --> 3:48:44.480]  and people just getting back to basics or what else is in the revolution
[3:48:44.480 --> 3:48:48.880]  well that's part of it you know my thing is i boycott corporate food
[3:48:48.880 --> 3:48:53.760]  i won't eat it i won't i go to the local guy won't go to the duncan donuts guy
[3:48:53.760 --> 3:48:57.600]  you know i i i support i go to the farmers markets

[3:49:02.080 --> 3:49:06.240]  we just saw obama they made a whole big deal about the planting their organic
[3:49:06.240 --> 3:49:11.840]  garden and buying local food and how healthy they eat
[3:49:11.840 --> 3:49:15.840]  let the rest of them eat franken foods is their motto
[3:49:15.840 --> 3:49:19.280]  it's okay for them and the quintines and the bushes
[3:49:19.280 --> 3:49:24.240]  for everybody to only eat the best but the rest of you people out there
[3:49:24.240 --> 3:49:30.800]  fatten yourself up on the junk food what goes in goes out junk food junk
[3:49:30.800 --> 3:49:36.080]  minds junk thinking and for this country to get back to where it used to be
[3:49:36.080 --> 3:49:39.200]  we need a renaissance and the renaissance is
[3:49:39.200 --> 3:49:42.880]  a rebirth a rebirth to when america was great
[3:49:42.880 --> 3:49:49.360]  when main street ruled not wall street not these greedy multimillionaires
[3:49:49.360 --> 3:49:54.000]  where do they come off colman sacks saying that well we earn this profits
[3:49:54.000 --> 3:49:58.960]  and we're distributing this this money these bonuses to our people
[3:49:58.960 --> 3:50:02.400]  because we're such brilliant traders oh yeah

[3:54:44.720 --> 3:54:48.720]  going to be able to stop it the only way they will be able to stop it is to
[3:54:48.720 --> 3:54:53.360]  continue to do what they're doing and that is to keep the people on the
[3:54:53.360 --> 3:54:57.040]  federal dictate and to make them more subservient
[3:54:57.040 --> 3:55:00.720]  and the pressure that is going to be bearing upon the people
[3:55:00.720 --> 3:55:05.280]  at every level from parking meters to property taxes
[3:55:05.280 --> 3:55:09.920]  from federal taxes to to syntaxes is going to be
[3:55:09.920 --> 3:55:13.280]  taxes they're going to squeeze the little people
[3:55:13.280 --> 3:55:18.000]  until there are riots and rebellions and and by the way the
[3:55:18.000 --> 3:55:21.520]  the the tea parties and tax protests
[3:55:21.520 --> 3:55:25.120]  that's just the beginning it was history has been made

[3:57:39.040 --> 3:57:44.560]  a bob Chapman was on and he stated that they would close the banks for a week
[3:57:44.560 --> 3:57:47.600]  and that they're going to open them up again everything would be all right i
[3:57:47.600 --> 3:57:51.600]  think he was too light-hearted on that can you say something about that well
[3:57:51.600 --> 3:57:55.440]  they closed the banks we believe that they'll devalue the dollar
[3:57:55.440 --> 3:57:59.440]  when they reopen them you won't be able to get all your money back out they'll
[3:57:59.440 --> 3:58:03.120]  use the argentinian method that's what they did over there
[3:58:03.120 --> 3:58:06.880]  when they're when their dollar collapsed and that and that's what we believe
[3:58:06.880 --> 3:58:11.840]  they'll do over here does that answer your question linda
[3:58:11.840 --> 3:58:14.720]  you'll be able to get your money but you won't be able to get it out all at
[3:58:14.720 --> 3:58:18.000]  once right and it won't be worth what it was if
[3:58:18.000 --> 3:58:22.640]  they closed the banks because we don't want to go to work thinking
