[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.300]  so does he keys Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.300 --> 00:32.340]  Texas Alex Jones you know I see a meme out of the internet now that it's a
[00:32.340 --> 00:37.320]  fairy tale that there's eugenics going on but it's a fairy tale that cancer
[00:37.320 --> 00:45.220]  rates are way up and neurological disorders and they're trying to take
[00:45.220 --> 00:52.420]  hatred of Israel and then connect it to me and say my eugenics thing is trying
[00:52.420 --> 00:56.860]  to cover up for Israel what does that even mean it's like when I made a film
[00:56.860 --> 01:04.060]  about Israel attacking the U.S. is liberty to blame it on Egypt all these
[01:04.060 --> 01:08.900]  big Nazi groups and others came out and said I was covering up for Israel because
[01:08.900 --> 01:12.700]  I pointed out that traitor LBJ was involved because that's what all the
[01:12.700 --> 01:17.580]  admirals I interviewed in the in the the first mate and all them said it was
[01:17.580 --> 01:22.100]  like no America wasn't involved you're now covering up for Israel I'm like no
[01:22.100 --> 01:25.940]  no there's two bank robbers I'm not covering up for one of them to say and
[01:25.940 --> 01:29.700]  this guy was involved too but but that is what matters I just read that it's
[01:29.700 --> 01:35.100]  like it's a total pipe dream I mean it's true that I don't hate Israel and
[01:35.100 --> 01:38.740]  think about it constantly and obsessed with it and worship it from a hateful
[01:38.740 --> 01:43.700]  position I understand there's evil and evil systems in control basically
[01:43.700 --> 01:50.980]  everywhere and and it's just crazy I'm covering eugenics and people are like
[01:50.980 --> 01:54.900]  there's no eugenics going on there then you know that's happening you work for
[01:54.900 --> 01:59.860]  Israel and there's just no connection to reality and whereas I don't like a lot of
[01:59.860 --> 02:04.700]  things Israel's doing I don't like the people that hate Israel either I mean
[02:04.700 --> 02:09.140]  can't you get that it's like it's like rabid crowds of people who are like in
[02:09.140 --> 02:13.140]  their gang and then they want you to choose a side in their gang fight and
[02:13.140 --> 02:18.940]  I'm just like hey mutual aggression truce as long as you don't do harm to
[02:18.940 --> 02:24.980]  anybody do whatever you want you want to go blow your brains out go ahead I'm I
[02:24.980 --> 02:28.780]  don't think you should but go ahead it's your right you want to smoke marijuana
[02:28.780 --> 02:33.780]  and sit in your mother's basement eating hot pockets all day hey I don't want cops
[02:33.780 --> 02:38.220]  pulling me over asking to search my car because you want to blast your brain and
[02:38.220 --> 02:41.100]  I know it's called the great medical uses and stuff I did a lot of potheds on
[02:41.100 --> 02:48.900]  top of it it does have its downside my point is that I I want freedom I want
[02:48.900 --> 02:53.220]  team humanity to succeed and the globalists the social controllers the
[02:53.220 --> 02:58.540]  crony capitalists use this tribalism this divide and conquer to get us fighting
[02:58.540 --> 03:05.820]  with each other that's why NBC and MSNBC edited the Zimmerman tapes and the
[03:05.820 --> 03:10.180]  Trayvon Martin case to make us all like he's a racist that's why they have the
[03:10.180 --> 03:13.380]  feds now admitted in the Justice Department inside the protest groups
[03:13.380 --> 03:16.980]  including the new Black Panther Party saying I want Florida burning start
[03:16.980 --> 03:19.980]  killing whitey and now all over the country I read the articles earlier
[03:19.980 --> 03:24.420]  white people are just for no reason being beaten by in racial attacks at
[03:24.420 --> 03:30.900]  parks and fairs and events old women you name it and in the government wants a
[03:30.900 --> 03:38.100]  race war meanwhile your banker bailout money paid to move not one not two but
[03:38.100 --> 03:43.980]  three new factories to China the 20 plus billion bailout to General Motors
[03:43.980 --> 03:50.980]  paid to ship it to Brazil paid to ship it to China paid to ship it to Eastern
[03:50.980 --> 03:54.620]  Europe and another expansion of facilities what's actually more than
[03:54.620 --> 04:01.900]  three fact four factories with your money 20 plus billion of it you paid to
[04:01.900 --> 04:07.740]  have the government take over General Motors and ship it to China if General
[04:07.740 --> 04:11.020]  Motors wants to move to China that's great there shouldn't be tax incentives
[04:11.020 --> 04:14.540]  it should be a level playing field see that's what globalism is in 21 new
[04:14.540 --> 04:20.020]  world order is that's why this book by Rosa Corey available at info wars com is
[04:20.020 --> 04:23.340]  so important behind the green mask give it to every city council member every
[04:23.340 --> 04:26.420]  county commissioner every sheriff you know because then everything going on
[04:26.420 --> 04:29.220]  around them they'll discover this we're starting to get city councils even in
[04:29.220 --> 04:33.820]  Houston bringing this up and blocking stuff the new film we're carrying
[04:33.820 --> 04:38.300]  farm again breaks down the harassment big agra funds government to shut down
[04:38.300 --> 04:44.300]  the little farms that's what it is France is going into deeper socialism as the
[04:44.300 --> 04:48.380]  answer to socialism wrecking their country that's the big danger blue rock
[04:48.380 --> 04:53.140]  well straight ahead a little rock will dot com to break it all down it's gonna
[04:53.140 --> 05:01.340]  be a jam-packed interview you'll want to stay with us this is Alex Jones with
[05:01.340 --> 05:05.100]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[05:05.100 --> 05:08.900]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[05:08.900 --> 05:13.420]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[05:13.420 --> 05:17.820]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in
[05:17.820 --> 05:22.180]  the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of
[05:22.180 --> 05:25.660]  the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[05:25.660 --> 05:29.420]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[05:29.420 --> 05:33.540]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[05:33.540 --> 05:37.500]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[05:37.500 --> 05:41.340]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[05:41.340 --> 05:44.020]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[05:44.020 --> 05:48.980]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at WWW dot my
[05:48.980 --> 05:53.140]  solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government
[05:53.140 --> 06:01.380]  doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup dot com or call 1-877-327-0365
[06:01.380 --> 06:05.020]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs
[06:05.020 --> 06:09.740]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[06:09.740 --> 06:13.660]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[06:13.660 --> 06:17.540]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[06:17.540 --> 06:22.060]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory
[06:22.060 --> 06:27.340]  system with yourself produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the
[06:27.340 --> 06:31.660]  silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued
[06:31.660 --> 06:35.820]  legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce
[06:35.820 --> 06:41.220]  pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to
[06:41.220 --> 06:45.060]  follow step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and
[06:45.060 --> 06:51.180]  simple go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[06:51.180 --> 06:58.060]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[06:59.100 --> 07:03.500]  sick of the globalist eugenesis control freaks adding poison to your water and
[07:03.500 --> 07:07.980]  laughing as you get sick and die start purifying your water with propure my
[07:07.980 --> 07:12.180]  friends I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar
[07:12.180 --> 07:17.020]  none is propure and it's available discounted at info wars.com its
[07:17.020 --> 07:20.780]  filters are silver and pregnant to prevent bacterial growth there's no
[07:20.780 --> 07:26.060]  priming required it's NSF 42 certified optional fluoride filters can reduce
[07:26.060 --> 07:31.380]  fluoride up to 95% easy to set up and use doesn't require electricity purify
[07:31.380 --> 07:35.540]  water from lake streams ponds and wells this filter system leaves in
[07:35.540 --> 07:39.420]  beneficial minerals which is key save money by not buying bottled water and
[07:39.420 --> 07:43.660]  avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic propure is the best gravity-fed filter
[07:43.660 --> 07:48.620]  out there it's what my family uses info wars.com already has the lowest price on
[07:48.620 --> 07:52.660]  propure but if you add the promo code water at checkout you get an additional

[08:07.220 --> 08:13.620]  continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:24.700 --> 08:31.140]  Blue Rockwell is our guest he's the founder of the Von Mies Institute he
[08:31.140 --> 08:38.380]  also served as Ron Paul's chief of staff in his first stint in Congress and he
[08:38.380 --> 08:44.020]  also helped write many of those great newsletters on top of it and of course
[08:44.020 --> 08:50.860]  he's a prolific writer today at bluerockwell.com and I always find it
[08:50.860 --> 08:54.180]  informative to get him on with us I appreciate him spending the next 52
[08:54.180 --> 08:58.220]  minutes with us here today will also interspersed some of your phone calls
[08:58.220 --> 09:02.100]  for people that are patiently holding I would just add that we have breaking
[09:02.100 --> 09:08.260]  news our sources say that it's about a 95% probability and it is booked out and
[09:08.260 --> 09:13.820]  they've met there twice before Chantilly Virginia builders stinkers are to meet
[09:13.820 --> 09:16.420]  there in the Washington Post even admits that they are to pick the vice
[09:16.420 --> 09:21.300]  president so now they've gone from denying it exists to admitting that they
[09:21.300 --> 09:26.580]  basically are gonna pick Mitt Romney's vice president they said that last week
[09:26.580 --> 09:29.740]  they said oh he's going to a Bilderberg steering meeting down in South
[09:29.740 --> 09:33.940]  America while Obama's there Rubio is to build his international cred and meet
[09:33.940 --> 09:39.540]  with some Bilderberg people what so now we've gone from it doesn't exist to
[09:39.540 --> 09:42.460]  it's not in the open I want to bring this up first to Blue Rockwell then we'll
[09:42.460 --> 09:45.620]  get into whatever's most important on his radar and then I want to get into all
[09:45.620 --> 09:51.020]  the crazy bills for the IRS outside of a jury or court says you can't travel right
[09:51.020 --> 09:54.660]  out of Soviet Russia right out of Stalinism we've got the announcements of
[09:54.660 --> 09:59.620]  drones satellites watching us carbon taxes Forbes magazine writer says burn
[09:59.620 --> 10:03.900]  down people's houses that they don't agree to carbon taxes I feel like a liar
[10:03.900 --> 10:08.700]  when I say that it's so over the top but he said it I mean these people you know
[10:08.700 --> 10:12.300]  I think the authoritarians know the worm is turning and they're starting to act
[10:12.300 --> 10:15.900]  like chickens with their heads cut off what do you think about all this well
[10:15.900 --> 10:21.300]  they're the worm we're not the worm but sure I think people are beginning to
[10:21.300 --> 10:28.060]  wake up I think right after 9-11 I must say I was concerned that you know we were
[10:28.060 --> 10:31.780]  gonna get much more of a totalitarian state I was right in that but I was
[10:31.780 --> 10:35.500]  concerned that people wouldn't really be resisting it but I think there is more
[10:35.500 --> 10:39.460]  and more resistance especially among the young we see it in the romp all campaign
[10:39.460 --> 10:45.660]  when he gets 8,000 students coming out to talk to him at UCLA kids hanging in
[10:45.660 --> 10:49.180]  trees climbing up in trees and staying there for hours just to just to watch
[10:49.180 --> 10:53.380]  him we can tell there's an intellectual revolution going on among the young and
[10:53.380 --> 10:58.860]  of course among those of us who are not young as well there's I think more and
[10:58.860 --> 11:03.500]  more knowledge of what's happening more and more anger at what's going on more
[11:03.500 --> 11:06.460]  and more worry and more and more determination to do something about it
[11:06.460 --> 11:10.380]  and this is the key if people will withdraw their consent from the
[11:10.380 --> 11:15.620]  government from the establishment from the whole regime and not play ball then
[11:15.620 --> 11:20.260]  they can't actually do it they can't actually work their dastardly deeds
[11:20.260 --> 11:24.180]  against us well you're right we're trotting on their tyranny now they're
[11:24.180 --> 11:29.060]  trying to break our will and so they're trying to lash out their worm is turning
[11:29.060 --> 11:34.380]  to go back to the old Shakespeare quote what do you make of them trying to set
[11:34.380 --> 11:38.940]  up internal checkpoints and say the IRS will take your passport away the
[11:38.940 --> 11:42.580]  passport is the proof of the citizenship the Supreme Court has rolled over and
[11:42.580 --> 11:47.540]  over again you cannot revoke citizenship it must be freely given up well I just
[11:47.540 --> 11:51.740]  meant I might just mention if we go back in history passport is a relatively
[11:51.740 --> 11:56.540]  recent thing you know there was a time before before the turn of the last
[11:56.540 --> 12:00.180]  century when mostly you could travel wherever you wanted to travel you didn't
[12:00.180 --> 12:02.980]  have to have documents you didn't have to get the permission of the of the
[12:02.980 --> 12:07.500]  various governments or police if even in one of the most interesting things John
[12:07.500 --> 12:11.500]  Maynard Keynes wrote and one of the few things that was not a bunch of lies he
[12:11.500 --> 12:16.220]  he looked back before World War one and he said what a different world this was
[12:16.220 --> 12:20.940]  that if a business person in London wanted to go set up a business in Paris
[12:20.940 --> 12:25.300]  he just took the train and went over there and was able to rent a place and
[12:25.300 --> 12:30.660]  start his business and the currency was sound it was a gold standard and he
[12:30.660 --> 12:34.540]  talked about just how much it's funny I guess even even Keynes had a conscience
[12:34.540 --> 12:38.980]  and he talked about how things were so much better in those days so the passport
[12:38.980 --> 12:43.220]  was invented as a means of the government to control us to control our
[12:43.220 --> 12:48.900]  travel it's now of course they're putting chips in it as we know and
[12:48.900 --> 12:52.940]  they're they're making it much more of an I have a they want to have an
[12:52.940 --> 12:56.740]  internal passport to whether it'll be the current passport or something else
[12:56.740 --> 13:02.220]  they do indeed want to control our travel as you mentioned Barbara Boxer has a
[13:02.220 --> 13:06.740]  bill that is suggested by the IRS of course these Congress people even the
[13:06.740 --> 13:10.860]  evil ones like boxer are mostly just puppets and so she was asked by the
[13:10.860 --> 13:16.220]  Treasury Department to introduce this bill where if they decide that you owe
[13:16.220 --> 13:20.380]  the money they can stop you from leaving the United States you have no
[13:20.380 --> 13:25.900]  right to travel maybe they'll put you in your house and have a have a you know
[13:25.900 --> 13:30.780]  device around your ankle to keep control of us all too it's always important I
[13:30.780 --> 13:33.620]  think when we're thinking about any of these things these horrible things that
[13:33.620 --> 13:37.540]  are going on these days as well as the good things that every government would
[13:37.540 --> 13:42.340]  like to be a totalitarian state they did that that's always their ambition
[13:42.340 --> 13:45.460]  that's the ambition of the people going to government and it's the ambition of
[13:45.460 --> 13:48.420]  the big private interests that are connected to government and benefit
[13:48.420 --> 13:52.260]  from government they would all like total control over those of over the
[13:52.260 --> 13:57.940]  peons over the mundane's over the the poor slobs as I think of us who go and
[13:57.940 --> 14:03.380]  work every day and are the actual producers in the country so it's what
[14:03.380 --> 14:07.220]  is it then that keeps every government from being totalitarian what is it that
[14:07.220 --> 14:11.740]  prevents things like what's happened since 9-11 in this country from taking
[14:11.740 --> 14:17.580]  place it's popular resistance so when you have something like 9-11 that so
[14:17.580 --> 14:21.140]  drastically diminished popular resistance to government government spying
[14:21.140 --> 14:26.180]  government intrusions and controls of every sort then the government just
[14:26.180 --> 14:31.260]  immediately expands and we know they're expanding in these tremendous ways we
[14:31.260 --> 14:34.860]  have a poker Roberts pointed out the day and the pointing out the really
[14:34.860 --> 14:39.380]  China as many ways freer than the United States that that you know at least in
[14:39.380 --> 14:42.940]  China there's no you don't have the Prime Minister saying by the way no nobody
[14:42.940 --> 14:46.460]  in China has any rights so we can kill you we can jail you we can torture you
[14:46.460 --> 14:51.020]  if we decide you're a bad guy even that and they don't say that only the US as
[14:51.020 --> 14:54.980]  they kind of thing and of course carries it out but again I think there's
[14:54.980 --> 15:00.900]  optimism abroad because of young people and because of just what we see as though
[15:00.900 --> 15:03.940]  as we can call it the Ron Paul movement although it's actually as Ron Paul
[15:03.940 --> 15:08.220]  points out broader than himself of course it's it's a libertarian movement
[15:08.220 --> 15:14.700]  it's it's a tremendous reaction to all the horrendous stuff that's going on that
[15:14.700 --> 15:18.220]  that doesn't mean we've got an easy path ahead things are going to be very very
[15:18.220 --> 15:22.060]  difficult much more difficult economically Obama is of course even
[15:22.060 --> 15:25.380]  worse than Bush hard to believe anybody could be worse than Bush Obama is worse
[15:25.380 --> 15:29.780]  than Bush and I imagine that a Romney will if he's elected will be worse than
[15:29.780 --> 15:35.500]  Obama if Obama is reelected he'll be worse than Obama the first time so you
[15:35.500 --> 15:40.220]  know I'd say we can't look to government as our salvation nothing good ever
[15:40.220 --> 15:46.340]  comes out of Washington DC it's really a carbuncle on the on the American body
[15:46.340 --> 15:51.540]  body politic and so we can't look to them we have to look to ourselves look
[15:51.540 --> 15:55.500]  to our neighbors we have to make the preparations for troubles ahead personal
[15:55.500 --> 16:01.180]  preparations financial preparations also ideological educational preparations we
[16:01.180 --> 16:05.740]  have to read we have to read books we have to read the right kind of things on
[16:05.740 --> 16:09.460]  the internet we have to educate ourselves to understand what the heck is
[16:09.460 --> 16:13.380]  happening we need to know some economics we need to know some real history we need
[16:13.380 --> 16:16.860]  to know actual political science we need to know what the nature of the state
[16:16.860 --> 16:21.700]  which is a Murray Rothbard said a gang of thieves writ large you think of
[16:21.700 --> 16:25.820]  government as a gang of thieves writ large it really explains everything and
[16:25.820 --> 16:29.100]  you won't be surprised at what they're trying to do and you know that the one
[16:29.100 --> 16:32.900]  thing we can do as they're trying to steal everything from us our liberty our
[16:32.900 --> 16:37.580]  money our lives our children our homes our businesses our communities that we
[16:37.580 --> 16:41.580]  have to resist them and the first step to resist him is to know who they are
[16:41.580 --> 16:45.980]  what they are why they're doing what they're doing and why we should oppose
[16:45.980 --> 16:50.940]  it in fact I want to inject a point on the subject that you raise the
[16:50.940 --> 16:57.980]  foundation of what is the state and they those that support big government and
[16:57.980 --> 17:02.500]  the monopolies that it creates have created through the control corporate
[17:02.500 --> 17:06.980]  media back when it still had dominance this idea that to not trust the state
[17:06.980 --> 17:14.620]  is un-American that to not blindly believe known certified liars is somehow
[17:14.620 --> 17:21.940]  insane and that you're a conspiracy theorist if you don't buy into whatever
[17:21.940 --> 17:26.020]  the system is shoveling at you but if you go back to the founding fathers and
[17:26.020 --> 17:30.340]  common sense if you go back thousands of years ago in every culture the
[17:30.340 --> 17:34.180]  population knew there was a corrupt elite ruling over them and the corrupt
[17:34.180 --> 17:41.380]  elite was in castles with armed forces basically keeping them in servitude but
[17:41.380 --> 17:45.980]  in comes in the 20th century and now 21st more sophisticated propaganda and
[17:45.980 --> 17:50.220]  they create this idea that the state loves you and wants to take care of you
[17:50.220 --> 17:53.740]  and that it's weird to not out of hand just trust him but take George Washington
[17:53.740 --> 17:59.740]  he was the first person who ever had executive power like that in in in more
[17:59.740 --> 18:03.980]  modern history who did not become king they wanted him to and when he left
[18:03.980 --> 18:07.820]  after two terms and went back to be a farmer because that's what he really
[18:07.820 --> 18:12.260]  enjoyed you know the king of England said today George Washington is the
[18:12.260 --> 18:16.460]  greatest man in the world and it was because no one would give up that type
[18:16.460 --> 18:22.460]  of power and so that that original Americana idea is so precious and the
[18:22.460 --> 18:27.460]  system claims it's alien and radical the truth is the system is what is alien
[18:27.460 --> 18:31.500]  and radical I want you to comment on that well there was an interesting column
[18:31.500 --> 18:34.940]  in the Washington Post recently where was moaning and groaning about the
[18:34.940 --> 18:40.380]  horrible was social secret service scandal and the GSA scandal these are so
[18:40.380 --> 18:43.940]  horrible they would undermine people's trust in the government well of course
[18:43.940 --> 18:48.140]  people should have no trust in the government or rather you can trust the
[18:48.140 --> 18:52.060]  government to always do the evil thing I mean they if they can get away with it
[18:52.060 --> 18:55.420]  if they don't do the evil thing it's because they either haven't thought of
[18:55.420 --> 19:00.540]  it or they don't think it's in their own interests or they can't get it together
[19:00.540 --> 19:04.900]  to do it because of course government is the most incompetent agency ever
[19:04.900 --> 19:09.860]  to exist anybody who's ever been in the military or worked for the civilian
[19:09.860 --> 19:13.500]  part of the federal government and is willing to tell the truth will tell you
[19:13.500 --> 19:17.580]  that they've never seen anything like this I mean it's just the waste the
[19:17.580 --> 19:22.460]  corruption the nastiness the controls and this is what of course they want
[19:22.460 --> 19:26.460]  they want the whole they want all of America to be like an airport we're all
[19:26.460 --> 19:29.780]  weighed patiently in line we're afraid to look them in the eye or maybe we're
[19:29.780 --> 19:32.420]  supposed to look them in the eye or otherwise you're a terrorist and the

[24:21.580 --> 24:34.900]  we will be victorious I want to get into politics the election with Leroc
[24:34.900 --> 24:40.460]  well he's a real expert on that and the fact that Ron Paul has already won as he
[24:40.460 --> 24:44.260]  wrote a few months ago in a piece I also want to read a quote out of light and
[24:44.260 --> 24:49.900]  liberty reflections on the pursuit of happiness Thomas Jefferson this is a
[24:49.900 --> 24:54.420]  book by Thomas Jefferson re-edited and released a guy came to my house and put
[24:54.420 --> 24:58.620]  this on my doorstep once my wife got pretty mad but it was a good book she
[24:58.620 --> 25:01.780]  had a 357 and told he got a leave he was knocking on our door at 10 o'clock at
[25:01.780 --> 25:05.500]  night trying to give me this but I didn't know how close he came but not a
[25:05.500 --> 25:10.900]  good idea to come to my house side issue let's go back to Leroc well Lou grab bag
[25:10.900 --> 25:14.860]  of everything going on right now what's front and center on your radar screen
[25:14.860 --> 25:18.820]  well it's you know so much bad that's happening but I do notice Ron Paul just
[25:18.820 --> 25:23.820]  wrote about this in fact that there's a new remember the SOPA bill SOPA that was
[25:23.820 --> 25:27.540]  designed to take control of the internet in the name of so-called
[25:27.540 --> 25:31.500]  intellectual property that bill was defeated thank goodness now there's
[25:31.500 --> 25:36.460]  another one even a worse one called sysma CISPA and these bills are both
[25:36.460 --> 25:45.300]  designed by the recording industry and the movie industry to and by the NSA and
[25:45.300 --> 25:50.540]  the FBI and the CIA and all the work together to crush the internet and to
[25:50.540 --> 25:54.100]  make sure that the movie industry and the recording industry can get what I
[25:54.100 --> 26:00.660]  would argue are unjust unjust profits through the government so it's it's in
[26:00.660 --> 26:04.260]  the name of stopping you know quote-unquote theft on the internet that
[26:04.260 --> 26:08.700]  they want to take total control they are before our eyes of course they are doing
[26:08.700 --> 26:18.780]  more than make us pay for it get rid of due process instead of them going out and forcing their so-called copyrights yeah I mean it's you know I would argue
[26:18.780 --> 26:22.380]  the both copyrights and patents are illegitimate grants of government monopoly
[26:22.380 --> 26:25.420]  but the way that it was in the Constitution everything was standable
[26:25.420 --> 26:29.540]  but starting under the Reagan administration this was stepped up to such
[26:29.540 --> 26:34.460]  a horrendous extent one of the excuses was to keep Mickey Mouse and copyright
[26:34.460 --> 26:40.100]  by the Disney Company and Ronald Reagan was always sort of the agent of the
[26:40.100 --> 26:45.300]  Hollywood Mafia among his other roles in life and so he you know rolled over
[26:45.300 --> 26:49.740]  for them and and these things were put in it keeps getting worse and worse they
[26:49.740 --> 26:54.820]  keep extending their copyrights and they're trying to say now you can't
[26:54.820 --> 26:59.900]  show a newspaper on TV the lawyers are and of course it's all made up a lady
[26:59.900 --> 27:02.820]  called earlier into the police are telling him you're not allowed to defend
[27:02.820 --> 27:06.780]  yourself in your home anymore because of the Zimmerman case and that you've got
[27:06.780 --> 27:10.700]  a call I mean because a cop said so that's just the way it is we have the
[27:10.700 --> 27:15.380]  in the TSA invading flea markets looking for you know allegedly counterfeit
[27:15.380 --> 27:20.460]  shirts that somebody's producing a shirt that might look like allegedly like you
[27:20.460 --> 27:24.500]  know a Gucci shirt or some expensive shirt they were making an inexpensive
[27:24.500 --> 27:28.940]  shirt no judge no jury they just go and seize the property put them in
[27:28.940 --> 27:34.220]  jail so it's all going to horrendous tyranny and this is right across the
[27:34.220 --> 27:38.900]  the world the US government uses this as a as a control they're trying to
[27:38.900 --> 27:46.500]  extradite him right now a boy from England who has Asperger's syndrome and
[27:46.500 --> 27:54.940]  as a teenager put up a website that had on it links to bit torrent sites and
[27:54.940 --> 27:58.540]  other sites where you could download movies so just the fact that he had a
[27:58.540 --> 28:02.340]  site which is not illegal in England by the way that had links to other sites
[28:02.340 --> 28:05.940]  US government wants to take this kid bring it back to this country put him
[28:05.940 --> 28:10.900]  in jail for 12 years 12 years and this is another thing going on in this
[28:10.900 --> 28:14.620]  country because the growth of the prison industrial complex there was recently
[28:14.620 --> 28:20.700]  a black lady a homeless lady who had enrolled her her child in a better
[28:20.700 --> 28:24.540]  school district than when she lived in they're putting her in jail again for
[28:24.540 --> 28:30.780]  12 years 12 years I mean so the one thing we need to we always need to keep
[28:30.780 --> 28:33.860]  in mind is the people who work in the government have what St. Augustine
[28:33.860 --> 28:39.540]  called the libido dominante the lust to dominate the lust to rule they like to
[28:39.540 --> 28:43.620]  take us and do this they this is their this is going to charge out of this they
[28:43.620 --> 28:48.060]  love this so not only is the prison industrial complex make a lot of
[28:48.060 --> 28:51.380]  profits for people a lot of these profits prisons are profitable and of
[28:51.380 --> 28:55.100]  course the government prisons are built by private industry and so forth so
[28:55.100 --> 28:59.420]  there's always that thing but people who work in the government love putting
[28:59.420 --> 29:04.020]  people in jail they love starting wars they like killing people and I'm not
[29:04.020 --> 29:08.300]  good people we don't want them running our lives well that's right I mean who
[29:08.300 --> 29:13.340]  wants a job at the TSA grabbing women and children's genitals I mean and it's
[29:13.340 --> 29:17.980]  coming out that they enjoy it and like it and tell people so well when Ron Paul
[29:17.980 --> 29:23.580]  was I had his first experience with this and it was horrendous his titanium
[29:23.580 --> 29:28.220]  knees so they used to when he goes a commercial he gets the full the full
[29:28.220 --> 29:30.820]  feel up they stay there I want to hear the story on the other side long

[33:16.180 --> 33:27.820]  lines of the info war yeah we see the earth from here and is infested with
[33:27.820 --> 33:32.540]  games that call themselves government then there's these big mega
[33:32.540 --> 33:38.220]  corporations to a group that are all anti-free market the big fortune 100
[33:38.220 --> 33:44.980]  sitting on top government sucking through government off the population and
[33:44.980 --> 33:49.020]  corporate welfare and trying to make the general public dependent and JP Morgan
[33:49.020 --> 33:54.580]  administering the welfare cards and the food stamps and it is a nightmare and
[33:54.580 --> 33:58.260]  and Lou I want you to finish your Ron Paul story but then I want to just get
[33:58.260 --> 34:04.420]  this question out now I'll do it after but sure people are waking up but that's
[34:04.420 --> 34:09.180]  people that can tie their shoelaces one layer the other half the population is
[34:09.180 --> 34:15.820]  on the government mammary gland yeah of course this is you know this is a read
[34:15.820 --> 34:18.700]  after the Ron Paul story I'll say a little bit more about that but I'll just
[34:18.700 --> 34:23.020]  finish that this is the first time he had to go through a full TSA treatment he
[34:23.020 --> 34:27.460]  has titanium knees therefore even if you wanted to go through the X where he can't
[34:27.460 --> 34:34.140]  they won't let him and he got them you know extremely intrusive and horrendous
[34:34.140 --> 34:40.140]  examination by the TSA and Ron said to the man he said how can you how can you
[34:40.140 --> 34:44.660]  stand to do a job like this and the man looked at him in the eye and said I love
[34:44.660 --> 34:49.980]  doing it so yeah they do of course these are not I mean the most I'm sure there
[34:49.980 --> 34:55.700]  are some decent people out of the 40 or 50,000 TSA blue shirts who are caught up
[34:55.700 --> 34:59.380]  in this they didn't have a job they needed something but really the kinds of
[34:59.380 --> 35:02.460]  people get hired by the government if they're decent people it's a mistake
[35:02.460 --> 35:06.180]  it's a mistake they're in there they don't want decent people in the government
[35:06.180 --> 35:10.540]  they want people you knew were willing to do this to you that's that's that's
[35:10.540 --> 35:14.980]  their philosophy. Listen when like top movie stars in LAX now it turns out
[35:14.980 --> 35:19.100]  stalkers are battling and doing anything they can to become TSA because it's
[35:19.100 --> 35:22.860]  Hollywood stars all day coming through and they go crazy and it's like a
[35:22.860 --> 35:28.180]  celebration it's on video and photos and they just grope them and grab them and
[35:28.180 --> 35:33.060]  miss USA they go in her pants in Dallas cuz they knew who she was and actually in
[35:33.060 --> 35:37.860]  her body and listen I was with Jesse Ventura they did it I have flown out of
[35:37.860 --> 35:41.340]  Vegas where I was doing a video shoot with Ventura and the guy knew who I was
[35:41.340 --> 35:46.580]  and said I have quote literally actually said this I have an administrative
[35:46.580 --> 35:49.900]  privilege he said by the way I heard your show yesterday from here in Vegas and
[35:49.900 --> 35:53.500]  all this and was rubbing on me and getting off on the power of it clearly
[35:53.500 --> 35:59.460]  getting off on it and when I flew with Ventura out of Atlanta they all knew who
[35:59.460 --> 36:04.940]  he was we're talking to him and we're taking their time squeezing his genitals
[36:04.940 --> 36:08.380]  and I couldn't believe it I sort of taking photos and Ventura was embarrassed
[36:08.380 --> 36:12.180]  and said stop and he made me erase them and he later sued him of course and it
[36:12.180 --> 36:16.140]  got thrown out and they actually went I don't I don't want to go over it the
[36:16.140 --> 36:24.020]  point is exactly they told Ron Paul I love it they love it they look how many
[36:24.020 --> 36:29.260]  are getting busted sorry go ahead oh of course they love it these are the kinds
[36:29.260 --> 36:32.940]  of people who who go into the government tend to go into the government not
[36:32.940 --> 36:36.500]  every postman is a bad guy but the people who tend to go into the government
[36:36.500 --> 36:40.340]  are like this and certainly the people who rise in the government if a Hayek
[36:40.340 --> 36:44.700]  wrote a great chapter in his book the road to serfdom on why the worst rise to
[36:44.700 --> 36:50.140]  the top in government unlike in in a private business and in private life
[36:50.140 --> 36:54.860]  the worst do not tend to rise to the top but in government the worst people the
[36:54.860 --> 36:59.620]  worst the worst liars the worst power mongers the worst war mongers the worst
[36:59.620 --> 37:04.580]  people who were just love all that's evil they are the ones that with the
[37:04.580 --> 37:08.940]  demagogues they're the ones who rise to the top and get and become you know
[37:08.940 --> 37:11.700]  president of the United States for example these are not the good guys
[37:11.700 --> 37:16.820]  these are the worst people in society and he looked at Ron Paul I told that
[37:16.820 --> 37:22.860]  story here on air at the drudge report he he looked at him and said I love this
[37:22.860 --> 37:27.580]  job indeed well he said no he said I love it run Ron said to him how can you
[37:27.580 --> 37:32.100]  how can you stand doing a job like this and he's looked him in the eye and he
[37:32.100 --> 37:36.660]  said I love it I love it so yeah there that he took at least he told the truth
[37:36.660 --> 37:40.620]  for that moment my guess is he wouldn't tell the truth in public but he told the
[37:40.620 --> 37:44.620]  truth with a great animus too of course these people they also hate us by the way
[37:44.620 --> 37:48.420]  as you put as you put out they talk about they're gonna care for us as always
[37:48.420 --> 37:52.020]  they're helping the poor they're helping the elderly they're helping the sick and
[37:52.020 --> 37:57.780]  so what you know they they of course are hurting all these groups and we can just
[37:57.780 --> 38:02.620]  see you know if we think of the government has passed so many laws very
[38:02.620 --> 38:07.500]  intrusive laws in the name of helping the disabled or in preventing assaults
[38:07.500 --> 38:11.100]  on children so where it was so when the government you know was in control of
[38:11.100 --> 38:15.220]  course we see how they treat the disabled in the airports we see how they
[38:15.220 --> 38:18.700]  treat children in the airports again you can't believe a word they say or
[38:18.700 --> 38:22.620]  rather you can typically believe the opposite of what they say so that's so
[38:22.620 --> 38:26.860]  that's the rule of thumb well it's not typically look at the TSA they lie on
[38:26.860 --> 38:33.260]  every subject and get caught and keep lying and I just can't believe the
[38:33.260 --> 38:36.340]  American people turn their children over to them so that's my next question
[38:36.340 --> 38:41.460]  what do you do about half the population that can't survive without a
[38:41.460 --> 38:45.540]  government paycheck and who believe it's there it's like that woman who had
[38:45.540 --> 38:50.460]  like nine kids and was getting like all these dozens of welfare checks and she
[38:50.460 --> 38:56.700]  said I deserve more what are you gonna do for me well you know we have one of
[38:56.700 --> 39:00.060]  the things that democracy does Hans Hermann Hoppe has a great book on this
[39:00.060 --> 39:04.020]  democracy the god that failed one of the democracy has been a great invention
[39:04.020 --> 39:07.340]  for government from a practical standpoint we end up with it you know
[39:07.340 --> 39:11.260]  socialist a or socialist b we can vote for so they don't they don't worry about
[39:11.260 --> 39:16.500]  who wins the election but from a from a ideological standpoint they convinced
[39:16.500 --> 39:19.300]  people that you know we are the government you hear Americans saying
[39:19.300 --> 39:24.420]  should we go to Mars should we invade Syria you know it's not we doing this
[39:24.420 --> 39:28.860]  it's this separate and this parasitical entity that's called the government and
[39:28.860 --> 39:35.020]  the military complex and so forth so democracy has you talked about earlier
[39:35.020 --> 39:38.020]  how in earlier times people saw the government as the rich people living in
[39:38.020 --> 39:41.820]  the castle and collecting taxes from them and they correctly saw the government
[39:41.820 --> 39:45.660]  as something separate from them democracy makes us believe entirely
[39:45.660 --> 39:51.580]  erroneously that we are the government and it it it blurs that distinction about
[39:51.580 --> 39:55.620]  who is and as John C. Calhoun said who's the the taxpayer and who's the tax
[39:55.620 --> 39:59.700]  eater so yeah there are a lot of people who getting government checks the
[39:59.700 --> 40:03.300]  government is still a minority though they can't they can't add if they were
[40:03.300 --> 40:06.900]  the majority they would the whole thing would collapse they have to be a small
[40:06.900 --> 40:10.860]  minority that is those who are entirely living off the government but by making a
[40:10.860 --> 40:15.100]  lot of other people a little bit living off the government they make them they
[40:15.100 --> 40:19.020]  hope to gain their loyalty and I'm sorry to say they do gain their loyalty so
[40:19.020 --> 40:22.380]  people are worried about oh gosh so security is gonna go broke or Medicare
[40:22.380 --> 40:25.820]  is gonna go broke although those things can't go broke any more than the
[40:25.820 --> 40:28.900]  Pentagon can't go broke as long as they got the printing press they'll keep
[40:28.900 --> 40:33.060]  everything everything in existence because that the dollar can be worthless
[40:33.060 --> 40:37.300]  but the all these things will will be in existence because they exist for
[40:37.300 --> 40:41.460]  purposes of control they don't exist to help people they exist to make people
[40:41.460 --> 40:45.700]  subservient to the government dependent on the government and mentally dependent
[40:45.700 --> 40:50.060]  on the government and never to threaten everything everything always to go along
[40:50.060 --> 40:54.620]  bathe them believe they're baloney whether it's taught in the public schools I
[40:54.620 --> 40:57.900]  mean I asked myself why do people send their kids to the public schools why
[40:57.900 --> 41:01.540]  would anybody do that some people are forced into it financially but a lot of
[41:01.540 --> 41:05.260]  people would easily afford send their children to a decent private school or
[41:05.260 --> 41:10.100]  to do homeschooling they won't do it because they think well this is I do
[41:10.100 --> 41:15.540]  but here's the problem then even good quote Christian schools or others want
[41:15.540 --> 41:19.460]  to be accredited so your child can quote get the credits to go to college or
[41:19.460 --> 41:22.580]  whatever which is now what more than half of college graduates will never even
[41:22.580 --> 41:26.500]  be able to get a job that pays for half of their debt it is a fraud because they
[41:26.500 --> 41:31.260]  ship the jobs out of the country by design but through crony deals and
[41:31.260 --> 41:37.100]  monopoly deals but now they are you know giving them stuff about how great
[41:37.100 --> 41:40.940]  Barack Obama's wife is and you know what you're supposed to eat under no child
[41:40.940 --> 41:45.060]  left behind even in the private schools that they're taking everything over
[41:45.060 --> 41:48.220]  well of course they do want to take over the private school a lot of these
[41:48.220 --> 41:50.900]  private schools and you have to be careful a lot of them are what a friend
[41:50.900 --> 41:54.580]  of mine calls public schools with tuition so yeah you what you are so I
[41:54.580 --> 42:00.220]  but why homeschooling is really the only probably the only thing that can where
[42:00.220 --> 42:04.100]  you can entirely be in control of what your children are being taught but there
[42:04.100 --> 42:07.220]  are good private schools still there are private schools that fight this sort of
[42:07.220 --> 42:10.300]  thing that don't just use the government curriculum but you're right about
[42:10.300 --> 42:13.700]  accreditation I mean accreditation is a government scheme is the government
[42:13.700 --> 42:17.940]  control scheme as to college yeah more and more people as you say are looking
[42:17.940 --> 42:22.700]  into whether you know James Alcher points out even the even the what we
[42:22.700 --> 42:26.500]  think of as less expensive colleges it's about a $200,000 expenditure
[42:26.500 --> 42:29.740]  because you have to take into account the money you're not earning during the
[42:29.740 --> 42:35.220]  years you're in college so it's it's a very expensive these kids end up with
[42:35.220 --> 42:40.020]  huge amounts of debt government aid government takeover the education
[42:40.020 --> 42:43.820]  system has made it possible what Ron Paul for example did when he was in
[42:43.820 --> 42:49.060]  college he worked his way through school now that's a science fiction idea
[42:49.060 --> 42:52.460]  these days nobody can work their way through school because the prices have
[42:52.460 --> 42:56.940]  driven so unbelievably high by the government benefiting the faculty
[42:56.940 --> 43:00.700]  benefiting the administration benefiting the groups that are connected to them
[43:00.700 --> 43:05.060]  and sticking it to the student same thing with medical care doctors do great
[43:05.060 --> 43:10.620]  hospitals do great big pharma do great does great patients get hurt so this is
[43:10.620 --> 43:14.260]  again the way the government does these things all these welfare schemes are
[43:14.260 --> 43:19.500]  actually evil they'd not and they're not does it's not it's not just that they
[43:19.500 --> 43:22.700]  don't turn out the way the government hope they turned out the government's
[43:22.700 --> 43:27.500]  motives are always wrong they're always evil they always seek control
[43:27.500 --> 43:34.220]  destruction taxes wars all the stuff let me stop you let me stop you look at
[43:34.220 --> 43:37.740]  history that sounds horrible to an individual person why would they do
[43:37.740 --> 43:41.460]  that individuals always think of well why would they want to have a false flag
[43:41.460 --> 43:46.200]  to take your rights to be the hero people always think of things from their
[43:46.200 --> 43:50.260]  individual perspective and your point of how they're like we're gonna attack Iran
[43:50.260 --> 43:55.140]  no we're not the foreign mega banks that run our criminal government are the
[43:55.140 --> 44:00.580]  ones doing that we're not putting fluoride in our water big chemical
[44:00.580 --> 44:04.260]  companies are paying government to put a toxic waste in your water and making you
[44:04.260 --> 44:08.300]  pay for it but when you read this book behind the green mask it's in a 21 by
[44:08.300 --> 44:11.980]  Rosa Cora that by the way is available at info wars.com it's all the quotes
[44:11.980 --> 44:16.380]  it's all the plans it's more a strong they want to post industrial society
[44:16.380 --> 44:20.940]  where no one is allowed to operate but them and that raises my next point where
[44:20.940 --> 44:25.380]  do you see this battle going because you know head guy a scientist James
[44:25.380 --> 44:30.180]  Lovelock has come out reverse himself admitted that it's all a big hoax man
[44:30.180 --> 44:35.820]  make global warming but that they needed it to basically be able to sell the
[44:35.820 --> 44:39.100]  public on other things that are good for the environment meanwhile government
[44:39.100 --> 44:43.380]  and social estates always are the worst to take the Soviet Union now we have as
[44:43.380 --> 44:47.160]  I mentioned the start of the interview Forbes coming out and saying I'm one of
[44:47.160 --> 44:50.500]  their writers let's burn down people's houses let's mark down where they live
[44:50.500 --> 44:55.380]  let's go get them and then that's allowed we have the Justice Department
[44:55.380 --> 45:00.300]  inside the protest for Trayvon Martin trying to get a riot going confirmed
[45:00.300 --> 45:05.660]  that's been leaked I mean my point is people shouldn't underestimate how
[45:05.660 --> 45:09.420]  authoritarian they are so looking forward from history because not just the
[45:09.420 --> 45:14.100]  way things are I want what we're where Lou Rockwell thinks things are going
[45:14.100 --> 45:19.940]  because the authoritarians now every day I see it are calling for violence are
[45:19.940 --> 45:25.940]  calling for dictatorial takeover they know we're waking up so now they're
[45:25.940 --> 45:30.980]  settling the idea within their ranks of let's just start arresting people for
[45:30.980 --> 45:34.260]  their speech there's going to be a big Dealey Plaza protest with fifty
[45:34.260 --> 45:38.900]  anniversary they've announced no protest allowed they're leasing to the school
[45:38.900 --> 45:45.860]  book building museum the entire area for two days for $110 leasing a park and
[45:45.860 --> 45:49.380]  and they're saying no one allowed there but their people because they know
[45:49.380 --> 45:54.100]  media is going to be there I mean this is just off the charts well if we think
[45:54.100 --> 45:57.620]  back to what the ancient Romans had as one of their slogans for the for their
[45:57.620 --> 46:04.660]  empire a DVD at emperor divide and rule divide and conquer governments always
[46:04.660 --> 46:08.020]  want to get people fighting against each other I mean whether we look at say
[46:08.020 --> 46:12.540]  what you know the US did in in Iraq they broke it up I mean so they caused
[46:12.540 --> 46:16.460]  tremendous tensions with the Sunnis and the Shiites and the Kurds and so forth
[46:16.460 --> 46:19.940]  this is what they want to do in Syria they're doing it in Syria this is what
[46:19.940 --> 46:23.180]  they want to do in Iran this is what they're doing in our own country so in
[46:23.180 --> 46:26.620]  order to keep people from focusing on their real enemy which of course is not
[46:26.620 --> 46:31.940]  al-Qaeda whatever it's Washington DC they want us they want to you know split us
[46:31.940 --> 46:36.180]  up so of course they promote race war they promote all kinds of horrible
[46:36.180 --> 46:40.100]  things that we should you know liberal should hate conservatives and all the
[46:40.100 --> 46:43.580]  rest they want that so they want you focusing on that and never to discuss
[46:43.580 --> 46:47.300]  the government you'll notice if we look listen to the say the neocon you know
[46:47.300 --> 46:50.980]  West Limbaugh or Sean Hannity or they never discuss the nature of the
[46:50.980 --> 46:54.460]  government we're always supposed to focus on oh the evil of flag burning or
[46:54.460 --> 46:58.980]  whatever so they all they always want you for on some other thing that doesn't
[46:58.980 --> 47:02.380]  threaten the government but that divides the people so they will not become
[47:02.380 --> 47:07.940]  united you don't have to be united diversity is wonderful of all sorts you
[47:07.940 --> 47:12.540]  don't have to be united in any sense except against the enemy where's the
[47:12.540 --> 47:16.940]  enemy the enemy is in Washington DC well so where do you see things going
[47:16.940 --> 47:20.020]  though I mean if you look into a crystal ball where do you see America in five
[47:20.020 --> 47:23.500]  ten years well you know first of all you have to be worried about things like
[47:23.500 --> 47:25.860]  the department that you've talked about about the Department of Homeland
[47:25.860 --> 47:32.700]  Security buying 450 million rounds of a hollow point 40 caliber ammunition what
[47:32.700 --> 47:36.740]  what are they doing that's enough to wage a war what what do they plan to do
[47:36.740 --> 47:41.020]  with that is it because they want to seize our guns and they're buying armored
[47:41.020 --> 47:47.060]  mobile pill boxes for the highways and TSA is now nationwide doing gropes and
[47:47.060 --> 47:51.980]  mag searches on street corners and buses I mean totally illegal that's right and
[47:51.980 --> 47:54.820]  we've have you know since some of the TSA people who said that there should be
[47:54.820 --> 48:00.540]  these booths at malls and at public libraries and in all public schools you
[48:00.540 --> 48:03.940]  should have to you should have to be groped to go into you know into anything
[48:03.940 --> 48:09.820]  they decide where you know there was some phantom terrorist from overseas might
[48:09.820 --> 48:13.780]  be coming when they put in the actual terrorists people spy on us take our
[48:13.780 --> 48:19.180]  money run our lives try to hurt us are in there are in our own government I'll
[48:19.180 --> 48:23.380]  put that in quotes so where do I see things headed I think there's a battle
[48:23.380 --> 48:27.180]  I mean as on the other hand there has always been a battle between between
[48:27.180 --> 48:30.780]  freedom and state this has always existed and as long as there's been
[48:30.780 --> 48:35.380]  civilized humanity sometimes the bad guys when we end up with an Egyptian
[48:35.380 --> 48:39.580]  system where the God where the God is actually the government and you have to
[48:39.580 --> 48:43.700]  bow down and you know be a slave be the slave of the Pharaoh on the other hand
[48:43.700 --> 48:47.380]  sometimes we have massive increases and in liberty it happened in the ancient
[48:47.380 --> 48:51.660]  world it's happened in America and then and other places now we're you know it
[48:51.660 --> 48:55.740]  seems like we're in retreat but the battle is I think never is going to be
[48:55.740 --> 49:00.980]  over until the end of the world there's always going to be this struggle so I
[49:00.980 --> 49:05.020]  think the struggle will continue I think we're going to be I would say ten
[49:05.020 --> 49:08.340]  years from now we will be far better off than we are today
[49:08.340 --> 49:13.180]  now that we won't have immense troubles we have a lot of economic troubles to go
[49:13.180 --> 49:17.300]  through who knows what the Federal Reserve is going to do to us name who
[49:17.300 --> 49:20.540]  does what the Federal Reserve has already done to us so we have all the
[49:20.540 --> 49:25.580]  all but the thing is government is subject to the laws of reality they all
[49:25.580 --> 49:30.180]  think in government that all they have to do use their one tool the gun put it
[49:30.180 --> 49:33.420]  to your head and say do it but we're going to put you in jail we're going to
[49:33.420 --> 49:36.820]  kill you this by the way is what's on the traffic ticket you don't pay your
[49:36.820 --> 49:40.820]  library fine or anything else this is the one way the government has to operate
[49:40.820 --> 49:45.220]  but the gun can't actually gun for for example is not exactly a creative force
[49:45.220 --> 49:48.780]  when they use when it's used it by a private criminal or government criminals
[49:48.780 --> 49:53.220]  and they there are a lot of things they cannot actually bring about so I think
[49:53.220 --> 49:57.580]  the fact that the kids are what Ron Paul you know they mentioned Ron Paul is
[49:57.580 --> 50:01.540]  actually already won because of the millions of minds he's changed not only
[50:01.540 --> 50:05.820]  in this country hearts he's touched not only in this country in Latin America and
[50:05.820 --> 50:11.780]  Asia and Europe kids love Ron Paul all over there's finally an alternative to
[50:11.780 --> 50:15.300]  the status left and status right when we come back I want to jam in a caller to
[50:15.300 --> 50:20.260]  Lou but also want to bring this up to you they have publicly now announced the
[50:20.260 --> 50:24.700]  war on terror is over but the TSA the checkpoints are intensifying and they
[50:24.700 --> 50:30.180]  say now it's now for domestic groups and libertarians and people they actually
[50:30.180 --> 50:34.140]  and returning veterans so they're now admitting what we warned they're saying
[50:34.140 --> 50:39.100]  don't worry about Alcada they work for us in Libya they're good now the enemy is
[50:39.100 --> 50:44.580]  you I mean that's amazing I want to ask you why are they hiding everything in
[50:44.580 --> 50:48.060]  plain view now I guess because they know we've been exposing them or they just
[50:48.060 --> 50:51.060]  gotten delusional we'll get Lou Rockwell's take on that straight ahead

[53:07.380 --> 53:12.180]  secret that they want to use ammo regulation to do so this is why it's so
[53:12.180 --> 53:16.620]  important to start ammo now but storing ammo can cause significant problems
[53:16.620 --> 53:20.340]  because ammo is still prone to deterioration over time like tarnishing
[53:20.340 --> 53:23.780]  brass surfaces that get rough and dirty which don't allow them to feed right
[53:23.780 --> 53:27.940]  and even the breakdown of the gunpowder all problems which can cause a firing
[53:27.940 --> 53:32.660]  malfunction when you need it most now for the first time ever you can buy ammo

[54:11.640 --> 54:16.940]  sunshine I don't know when I'm stuck in full you know I'll be honest with you
[54:16.940 --> 54:21.100]  I had an important question for rockwell that I wanted to answer so I went to break
[54:21.100 --> 54:25.180]  and now I can't even remember it because during the break Kurt Nemo said have you
[54:25.180 --> 54:32.220]  seen my new article at info wars dot com and I started reading it and I'd seen
[54:32.220 --> 54:36.500]  this call by the White House this is this is racketeering this is discrimination
[54:36.500 --> 54:39.260]  like black people come and try to buy your house they've got the credit you
[54:39.260 --> 54:43.340]  say I don't sell to black people but see when government and corporations do it
[54:43.340 --> 54:47.580]  it's supposedly okay Bank of America's war on the Second Amendment they're now
[54:47.580 --> 54:54.220]  telling a major CEO of a major gun company they will not let them do
[54:54.220 --> 54:58.700]  business with them have bank accounts loans whatever Bankster giant Bank of
[54:58.700 --> 55:01.660]  America has joined the effort to take down the Second Amendment and deny
[55:01.660 --> 55:06.580]  Americans the right to own and use firearms Kelly McMillan the CEO of
[55:06.580 --> 55:10.620]  McMillan fiberglass stocks McMillan group international McMillan firearms
[55:10.620 --> 55:14.140]  manufacturer recently wrote on his Facebook page of Bank of America has
[55:14.140 --> 55:17.180]  refused to do business with his companies because they sell firearms and
[55:17.180 --> 55:21.380]  we're seeing where they won't take ads and newspapers for them Bank of America
[55:21.380 --> 55:26.180]  admitted its decision was political his response was to immediately stop doing
[55:26.180 --> 55:31.140]  business Bank of America and because they're saying that they won't do business
[55:31.140 --> 55:38.060]  with him and it goes over at all I mean this is just it's so authoritarian Lou
[55:38.060 --> 55:42.500]  what was my questions we went to break do you remember well you wanted to talk
[55:42.500 --> 55:48.060]  about what's ahead I frankly don't remember exactly what you know I got
[55:48.060 --> 55:54.460]  blindsided by this what do you make of just of all the all the authoritarian
[55:54.460 --> 55:58.460]  stuff they're doing it's not stopping people buying all-time record five
[55:58.460 --> 56:01.500]  million guns a month and saying it's because they don't like the government
[56:01.500 --> 56:05.820]  I mean they're losing don't they get it and they're bullying is it scaring
[56:05.820 --> 56:10.660]  people anymore well you can't you know something else you can't trust is the
[56:10.660 --> 56:14.860]  big banks you can't trust the big banks these are these are institutions
[56:14.860 --> 56:19.820]  that are inherently corrupt they engage in fractional reserve banking meaning
[56:19.820 --> 56:23.100]  that they're fraudulent they are the government they admit in Europe that
[56:23.100 --> 56:26.780]  they've taken over Europe no and they and they cooperate with the Federal Reserve
[56:26.780 --> 56:29.860]  to bring on the business cycle if it weren't for the big banks and the Federal
[56:29.860 --> 56:33.900]  Reserve and banking I must say in general as it exists in this country we
[56:33.900 --> 56:37.180]  wouldn't have recessions and depressions so these are these are not good
[56:37.180 --> 56:41.420]  institutions and they treat you of course like a like a microbe if you're
[56:41.420 --> 56:45.260]  one of their customers and so as you say they're getting rid of they're getting
[56:45.260 --> 56:48.060]  rid of one of their business customers because they don't like people owning
[56:48.060 --> 56:50.380]  guns well I'm sure they don't well people ought to get out of bank
[56:50.380 --> 56:54.900]  hope nobody has an accountant bank of America get out of bank of America
[56:54.900 --> 56:59.260]  so disconnected banks exactly small bank so you're much better off dealing with a
[56:59.260 --> 57:03.340]  small community bank you can check the ratings but you're far you know don't
[57:03.340 --> 57:07.340]  deal with these great big banks and also dealing cash to the extent you can the
[57:07.340 --> 57:11.700]  government hates cash the banks of course hate cash because if you're dealing
[57:11.700 --> 57:15.780]  in cash they don't have that money to be able to pyramid loans on top of it and
[57:15.780 --> 57:19.860]  cause all kinds of trouble and and to exacerbate the whole inflation process
[57:19.860 --> 57:22.860]  well that's what I was about to say in closing is we're almost out of time and
[57:22.860 --> 57:27.460]  of course they don't have time for calls is that they try to charge $5 every time
[57:27.460 --> 57:31.860]  you use your own bank card when they're using your money people said no but this
[57:31.860 --> 57:36.700]  shows how disconnected Bank of America Goldman Sachs JP Morgan the shareholders
[57:36.700 --> 57:40.700]  the fellow reserve are they think they're God and are trying to shut down real
[57:40.700 --> 57:47.500]  local banks but one small thing you can do again is use cash deal in cash they
[57:47.500 --> 57:50.620]  if you try to get a significant amount it's actually fun to do it to go into
[57:50.620 --> 57:54.300]  your bank and ask for a significant amount of your own cash they hate your
[57:54.300 --> 57:58.420]  guts they'll do everything possible they make you feel bad that you wanting your
[57:58.420 --> 58:01.900]  own money and the reason is because it hurts them when you when you get that
[58:01.900 --> 58:06.940]  cash out you deal in cash so the extent that everybody can deal in cash deal with
[58:06.940 --> 58:10.460]  a small bank you're hitting them where it hurt hey I've gotten out less than do
[58:10.460 --> 58:14.660]  I've gotten out less than 10,000 and had bank managers call me and ask me if I'm
[58:14.660 --> 58:19.900]  a criminal just to make me feel bad yeah of course you're not you're not you're
[58:19.900 --> 58:24.540]  not a tool of the banksters you must be a bad guy because they're the bad guys

[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:08.180]  last week we had Charlie Daniels on the show he's woken up to the new world
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:13.140]  order agenda 21 and so much more and a lot of people heard it and have begged
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:17.180]  me to re-air it some people said they only caught part of it so you want it
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:24.540]  you got it here is a on-core rebroadcast of my interview last week with the
[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:30.020]  country legend Charlie Daniels the devil went down to Georgia he was looking
[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:33.660]  for a soul to steal he was in a bang because he was way behind he was willing
[01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:37.540]  to make a deal when he came across this young man sewing on a fiddle and playing
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:41.740]  hot and the devil jumped up on a hickory stumps and boy let me tell you why I
[01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:46.420]  guess you didn't know it but I'm a fiddle player too and if you'd care to
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:51.460]  take a dare I'll make a bet with oh man it is hard to turn that off the devil
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:57.660]  is do that is one of my favorite songs in country Western folk you name it and
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:01.540]  my children love it we routinely listen to it when we're cooking breakfast in
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:06.060]  the morning a part of the greatest hits with Johnny Cash and people like that in
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:09.060]  the background but this is the first time I've ever talked to him and I'm
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:14.420]  almost tongue-tied Charlie Daniels he needs no introduction but the best part
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:18.100]  is he's always loved America he's always offended the Bill of Rights and
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:22.180]  Constitution including the Second Amendment and now he's really coming
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:26.820]  out against the globalist the New World Order agenda 21 and I was just talking
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:30.260]  to him the last two or three minutes before he went live here Charlie Daniels
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:34.300]  of Charlie Daniels.com he's on tour nationwide right now but he told me he's
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:38.820]  not here to talk about that he's heard to talk about Agenda 21 and a new
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:42.300]  documentary that he's voiced called Behold a Pale Horse on the Second
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:46.900]  Amendment and more Mr. Daniels great to have you here with us. Thank you very
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:51.620]  much and it's good to be with you and that's you know everybody need to be
[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:55.060]  talking about gender 21 this is one another one you know one of the things
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:58.980]  that really scared me and to scare everybody is the way this health care
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:04.380]  bill got pushed through is you can wake up one morning and after a midnight
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:08.540]  session of Congress we could be there could be I mean I'm telling what could
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:14.540]  be done and this agenda 21 is an evil diabolical thing it is global and in
[01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:18.540]  scope and everybody's know about it I think people know about it we've been
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:23.700]  armed by well you write about it at Charlie Daniels.com tell us about your
[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:28.260]  you know political awakening that's I guess decades old but currently what
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:31.620]  you're most focused on and let's talk about Agenda 21 and why people should
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:35.860]  be concerned about it. Well let me let me just read a little thing here from
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:40.140]  Agenda 21 the American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:45.460]  the world and there must be a shift in attitudes individual wants needs and
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:50.180]  desires are be conformed to the views and the dictates of government planners
[01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:55.460]  in the process of implementing sustainable development individual rights
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:03:00.580]  we'll have to take a backseat to the collective that's for starters that if
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:04.700]  that shocks anybody then you should dig a little deeper into this thing and I
[01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:08.020]  just don't look at it up don't take my word for it that does just go look it up
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:12.580]  the information that's been pretty bold about it I will say that and the
[01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:18.300]  information is readily available on the internet this is a this is a thing that
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:24.860]  you know I mean it goes on into no individual ownership of property
[01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:29.540]  I heard a thing the other day I raise I raise farm animals I raise cows and
[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:35.460]  horses and there's a there's a bill that passed to I didn't know it passed time
[01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:40.300]  but it was called the Food Protection Act that might have been the exact food
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:46.820]  safety act food safety act right and I called our two senators I called it was
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:50.460]  in Senate time and I called Senator Mar Alexander's office and I called Senator
[01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:55.260]  Corker's office and I said I asked you to talk to you to one of them but I
[01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:59.620]  talked to their age and I asked a guy it had already I didn't know I thought it
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:04.740]  was on the floor it had passed Senator Alexander had voted for it I called
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:08.340]  Senator Corker's and I said I asked a guy I said what about the small farm I was
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:12.220]  Senator Alexander would never do anything to hurt farmers call Senator Corker's
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:17.860]  office well Senator Corker voted against it now you know what what's the deal
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:21.860]  here if it's good to stay to Tennessee why would one senator vote for it and
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:26.780]  one vote against it the thing about to me is this and what people don't
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:31.980]  realize there's been has to be brought home to people you say okay if it's you
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:35.700]  know things go south I got an acre of ground I go in Planet Garden I'll get
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:41.300]  me a cow a couple pigs it's chicken no you won't because under the Food
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:45.740]  Protection Act they could come in and say you can't grow anything because
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:49.780]  you're spreading bad stuff into the food supply I saw a thing the other day

[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:07.820]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:12.020]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:16.060]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:19.940]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:24.020]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:28.380]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:32.660]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:36.380]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:20.340]  agenda 21 wants to reduce the population of the planet Earth by some I'm afraid
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:25.500]  they didn't say it because I thought it really makes me sound crazy but some
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:30.900]  tremendous event earth is God to these people and they're you know we're
[01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:37.500]  mistreating earth as evil human beings the Bible says God gave you know he gave
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:45.020]  this earth demand to just subdue and animals on it put everything on it and
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:50.420]  it's earth is not God I love the earth I'm a very earthy sort of person but it is
[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:55.860]  not my God it is not a God it doesn't have any power and we have mistreated it
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:09:00.060]  I know we've mistreated but it's the earth is perfectly capable of
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:04.220]  refurbishing itself I was about to say Charlie but Charlie Daniels our guest
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:08.020]  they don't care about the environment these globalists they've got a lot of
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:11.740]  people that follow them that do that are misguided it's all about a power grab
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:17.460]  under agenda 21 Obama can shut down coal power plants that his buddies don't own
[01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:21.020]  and he's done it and then that makes a general electric and others who by the
[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:25.700]  way are tax exempt under this fraud they make giant profits it's about monopolies
[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:29.740]  and when you talk about the food safety act you're right big pharma and big
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:33.500]  agro wrote it to shut down family farms I mean look at him going after the
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:36.980]  Amish I'm just backing you up here Charlie look at him going after people
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:41.540]  with lemonade stands look at him going after gardens the system does not want
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:45.860]  us self-sufficient well you know what the next move is gonna be don't you it's
[01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:50.380]  gonna be coming after your guns oh yeah there is something a foot here right
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:53.620]  now I don't know what it is but there's something and the one thing you're
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:59.380]  really scares me is the fact that we are one Supreme Court justice away from
[01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:03.900]  Obama doing just about anything thing he wants to do I mean if you can't get it
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:07.220]  through the Congress the Congress and saying it would never happen if that's
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:10.420]  try to take people's guns away from them they would not do it they know it would
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:15.060]  be political suicide but if it's done through the Supreme Court it becomes a
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:19.540]  law of the land I think it ain't gonna sit well down my way at all it ain't
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:23.620]  gonna sit well but if they come out and people say well I will not give them my
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:29.180]  gun to take about one or two ruby ridges and wait coast to convince people
[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:33.180]  hey it ain't worth it you know and that's that's how deep this thing goes it's
[01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:39.500]  you know it's it scares the heck out of me I'm 75 years old you know I mean I
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:43.100]  don't know probably see this stuff implemented or not but I got a kid and
[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:47.420]  I got grandkids and I don't want to see them live in a world that big brother
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:51.380]  runs and you gotta worry about some Nazi type and so become knocking on the
[01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:54.860]  door in the middle of the night and they give you the task about some opinion
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:11:02.180]  that you have a hate crime to me what is hate crime I mean you know if you kill
[01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:07.940]  somebody you must hate them exactly you kill somebody if you hate somebody it's
[01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:12.260]  a hate crime you kill them twice what is it you know what's the difference so
[01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:17.180]  yeah this stuff there's these little things in this Obamacare thing that was
[01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:22.340]  passed we have a congressman named Bart Gordon in Tennessee that he was not
[01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:28.460]  gonna run again he voted again he voted for the Obamacare knowing that his
[01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:32.940]  constituency did not want it he had disappeared nobody even knows where he
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:36.500]  said I tried to call him out he owes it to the people who put him in office to
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:41.060]  come out and tell us why he voted for it and now we see Obama Charlie Daniels is
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:45.540]  our guest right now giving 2,000 plus companies waivers so again his buddies
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:48.740]  get waivers from what he does that's total discrimination but going back to
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:53.180]  the Second Amendment as you know I know you're a big supporter of them the NRA
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:57.460]  and they're usually pretty you know conservative about what they say they
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:01.140]  have the intel the Washington Times reported on this last year that in his
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:06.460]  second term he is gonna try to ban semi-autos and then we got documents
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:11.060]  that he told the Brady campaign don't worry I'm gonna do it quote under the
[01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:14.940]  radar and remember that tape that got recorded he know people have where he
[01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:20.860]  said yeah these Bible hugging you know gun hugging a bitter clangers and so
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:25.580]  absolutely sir they are coming after our guns what about fast and furious
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:31.060]  where Obama ship guns into Mexico and CBS got the memos to blame the Second
[01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:37.500]  Amendment well you know I think Eric Holder for the two things he should
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:40.700]  have been even if he did that he should be appeased and run out of office he
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:44.460]  couldn't know about it if he didn't he could be run out for incompetence how
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:50.500]  do you cross all guns into a sovereign nation across international borders and
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:54.700]  nobody knows about it except the peons that work in the bank now just tell me
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:59.780]  how did how do you do that if the bottom administration is that incompetent if they
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:04.460]  can do that if they can carry guns across state lines I mean across in the
[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:08.100]  international borders and give them to people or I mean in essence that's what
[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.420]  happened it's not that they didn't actually tear them across their self I
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:15.100]  mean once and you don't know about it it's going on in your department when
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:19.660]  you fire everybody in your department if you know but that's got to do about it
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:23.020]  he had to know about it there's no way Holder didn't know about that thing I
[01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:26.540]  don't care what he said and I honestly and I will if you use the line if he
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:29.900]  says you don't know anything about it he knew it he knew that early on he didn't
[01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:33.500]  do anything about it he's such an arrogant so be that he thinks that
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:38.180]  anything he does you can get away with and you know this is just any other
[01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:44.180]  administration would have fired him two years ago and he this guy's wreaking
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:50.620]  havoc with America he's wreaking havoc and in Arizona people knew what was
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:58.420]  going on Arizona I met the family of a rancher a third generation or so rancher
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:03.580]  in Texas who was killed by people coming across the border I mean this is a
[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:08.060]  family it's a good American family they've been to make a good honest living
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:12.380]  off the land and are good people and there's father and their husband had
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:16.620]  been killed by these people who come across the border this is what's
[01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:22.540]  happening in all along the border you don't care about it but every time
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:26.540]  somebody comes across some of these people come across certainly they come
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:31.060]  across there's one like a living okay you want to make a living you want to go
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:35.540]  do it like everybody my people did when they came from Ireland and other people
[01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:39.340]  when it came to Germany and Israel and all these places immigrated here why
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:44.460]  just because they live next to us people in Canada can't do that people in
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:48.940]  Canada can't walk walk across the border this is so dead gone totally political
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:56.820]  and so basic spending and so you know contingency fame that we well we get
[01:14:56.820 --> 01:15:03.660]  as many voters we get what tell me something how can you go into bank and
[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:07.620]  cash a check and it can make you put out a picture ID I can't get your plane
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:12.940]  without put the picture ID I can vote in my state and they know who I am I vote the
[01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:16.660]  same polls all the time but you got to present that ID before they let you
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:20.900]  vote and you mean to tell me that it's right to let people go vote we don't
[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:24.860]  even know if their citizens Charlie as you know all over the country right here
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:27.980]  in Austin they let the illegals basically vote they let them get bank
[01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:32.500]  accounts with no ID but I've got to go show three sometimes at my bank the
[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:36.580]  point is is that the government elite are on top the illegals are second
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:41.180]  citizens are third-class and the government just ignores laws whenever
[01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:46.620]  they want it's totally lawless this is globalism now talking about a gen 21 in
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:50.820]  this whole world government situation I'm seeing a huge awakening Arizona's on
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:54.820]  the verge of passing it another state has passed a law against it other states
[01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:58.980]  are passing laws against the NDAA to secretly arrest Americans it does look
[01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:03.340]  like there is an awakening happening and to go back to that song you had about
[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:07.940]  you know America waking up and getting you know together it again you know we
[01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:12.860]  damn sure fooled you I think we're on the cusp of another big awakening I
[01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:17.340]  certainly hope you're right I'll be right I was I was that involved in
[01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:21.660]  national prayer you know yesterday I was making speeches on a big page I was
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:25.820]  talking about the further away we get in God the more lost we get and I mean
[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:33.340]  it's just that it's the absolute fact that in this thing of being upset when
[01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:38.380]  you see across somewhere or something in this little handful of people I want to
[01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:43.420]  remove you know they'll tell you these people will tell you now just rank it
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:47.020]  about citizens what is constitutional separation church and state it's not in
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:51.260]  the Constitution it says nothing about separation church and states is
[01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:56.500]  Congress shall pass no law concerning religion that's right Congress can make
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:17:00.060]  no law and they take a letter from Thomas Jefferson saying he didn't want
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:04.420]  to have one church a one-state religion and they twist it so instead the
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:08.180]  government runs a religion and they say that's the Constitution when that's the
[01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:13.380]  opposite government cannot touch it cannot do anything zero Congress will
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:16.500]  make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:21.700]  exercise thereof Charlie Daniels you are absolutely on target well you know
[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:25.780]  that that part of the law and the Constitution was to protect the church
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:30.300]  from the from the government not the government from the church and it was all
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:34.940]  twisted around but you know if we start talking about you know things that
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:39.580]  offend you I think that's all time it's been me but I'm not gonna go out and do
[01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:43.340]  a protest about it because I you know I don't I don't like it if other people
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:47.460]  want to you know have blue pictures up and that sort of thing I don't have to
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:51.580]  look at I want I want right back don't bother me I can't do the same thing with
[01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:56.260]  the cross it's like these people just go around and look for little things that
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:18:00.780]  and what the situation is it's not separation of church and state it's
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:05.620]  separation of God and state that's what they want to do well sir as you know they
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:09.300]  want to replace it with this fake environmentalism is in 21 they admit in
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:13.180]  the UN they want a global religion they said that at the last big UN summit
[01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:19.300]  that Lord Moncton and others that were there saw and got the documents on this
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:24.020]  is a cult and you notice it's just Christianity they're even telling people
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:28.900]  not to wear shirts with a cross on it in the mall now it's an idea that you
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:33.140]  don't have freedom of speech in this country we have freedom of speech in
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:37.220]  this country I will wear it that blame thing I'm pleased to you know I mean
[01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:41.580]  that's just a situation don't hold people at people listening people don't be
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:46.180]  intimidated don't be intimidated by this stuff that that the biggest part of
[01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:49.540]  these things that you're hearing are not law they're not law in this country
[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:55.100]  separation of church and state is not law it's not constitutional this thing
[01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:59.900]  agenda 21 that we're talking about please don't take my word for it I don't
[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:04.380]  want you to take my word for it I want you to believe it so go look it up on
[01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:09.100]  your internet go check it for yourself it is very real it's been going on since
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:14.300]  back in the 70s some of the most powerful people in the world are connected
[01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:20.100]  to it and endorsing it and promoting it and the UN which in my book should be
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:23.660]  the building should be pushed into these river turned into homeless hotel and
[01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:28.660]  running people out of here then go to Paris it's just a toothless debating
[01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:34.740]  society anti-american debate society I should say you imagine you idiots running
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:39.700]  anything they can find their way to the bathroom and they want to run they want
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:43.700]  to take over our national parks they want to say what we can do with our food
[01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:48.220]  chain what kind of animals we can raise and this sort of thing it ain't it's just
[01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:52.660]  like you said a while ago this is total paragraph total control all right folks

[01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:12.260]  Wordsworth you're an anachronism like a ghost from another time I am nothing
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:16.820]  more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:20.980]  you're a bug mr. Wordsworth a crawling insect an ugly
[01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:25.740]  misforned little creature who has no purpose here no meaning I am a human
[01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:33.100]  being words mr. Wordsworth that have no substance and no dimension like air like
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:39.820]  a wind I don't care I tell you I don't care I'm a human being I exist and if I
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:45.580]  speak one for a loud that thought lives even after I'm shoveled into my grave
[01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:52.940]  delusions mr. Wordsworth delusions that you inject into your veins to make you
[01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:57.260]  think you have a strength but you have no strength at all you have nothing but
[01:24:57.260 --> 01:25:04.500]  spindly limbs and a dream and the state has no use for your kind resistance to
[01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:22.060]  tyrants his obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:27.420]  all right Charlie's with us another 20 minutes he'd stay longer but he's got
[01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:30.300]  to get on down the road to play a gig and I said hey listen we'll get you out
[01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:33.660]  here in 20 minutes and you can be off the racist and he said oh you know how
[01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:38.740]  true that is I'm playing the Kentucky Derby this weekend okay let's let's go
[01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:44.340]  to some phone calls here Jonathan Michael John Patriot Richard and others
[01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:50.060]  Jonathan in Texas you're on the air with Charlie Daniels yes sir this is
[01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:55.980]  glad to speak with you Charlie Daniels this is that Fox 777 and I was wondering
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:26:03.460]  can you by chance assemble a cast to sing about agenda 21 similar to like
[01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:07.660]  they did with we are the world we listen he's the guy that did the song that
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:12.820]  in America oh I love that song and then I mean so many other patriotic ones yeah
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:19.980]  we saw that new song that came out by Hank Williams Jr. telling Obama where he
[01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:24.220]  can go for getting him fired what about you doing something like that well you
[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:28.220]  know I'm kind of taking it it comes I guess I get these inspirations to write
[01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:32.060]  songs I don't know but that was a unique idea that you came up with there
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:37.780]  Jonathan I haven't really thought about it in that way I am very much I want so
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:42.500]  bad and what we're doing now is good is to let people know a lot of people don't
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:46.780]  know this may even exist they have to know what it exists they have to know
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:50.820]  what's in it and I believe when they do we will see some bad people in this
[01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:54.860]  country you could have a song about get your 21 out of here or you're gonna get
[01:26:54.860 --> 01:27:05.620]  a 21 gun salute oh man yeah thank you Jonathan man Michael in Texas you're
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:10.580]  on the air go ahead don't yeah gentlemen it's a pleasure speaking to you hey yes
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:15.580]  sir big big fanny yours big fanny yours and you know what you probably hear my
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:19.780]  Yankee accent I've only been down here in Texas for a few years but it's the best
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:24.260]  thing that ever happened to me this job transfer but the thing that and I'm
[01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:29.700]  asking if you've seen this even in your state people that you know all they care
[01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:34.660]  about probably is volunteer football and you know dancing with the stars or
[01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:39.820]  even on you know CMT they'll watch them that version of yeah but there's always
[01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:42.540]  people I want his answer to this but there's always people that don't care
[01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:46.260]  it's always been a minority that actually fights for liberty just like in
[01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:55.100]  1776 Charlie yeah that's true but if it's a firing up a minority you get the
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:59.780]  majority's attention you know the people don't realize this thing I didn't I was
[01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:03.780]  unaware of the scope of this thing myself but just a while ago I didn't I
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:07.940]  didn't you know I've been hearing about this global thing going on for a long
[01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:11.180]  time but they get down to get specific about it they've now put a lot of it in
[01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:16.020]  writing as to what it exactly says who showed you the proof who showed you the
[01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:20.540]  proof and turn Charlie Daniels loose I looked up on the internet I mean it's

[01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:06.620]  believe in that's the name of the game well there's a reason the globalist and
[01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:09.500]  the communists and the socialists and the collectivist are always trying to
[01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:14.660]  impact us into shutting up because we've got the power free market capitalism
[01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:19.980]  liberty private property family God country that trumps the crap I'm sorry to

[01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:52.860]  question to you is upon reading the undercover of darkness timing of for
[01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:57.620]  example the National Defense Authorization Act if upon reading that
[01:35:57.620 --> 01:36:01.700]  you got the exact same sort of red flag feeling that a lot of us got thinking
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:05.460]  this is a practically for us not for other countries let me put it this way
[01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:11.260]  Obama now says the war on terrors over overseas and Al Qaeda's good going after
[01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:15.780]  Libya and they're our friend now and men laden's dead but then he says we're
[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:20.540]  gonna expand the TSA now they have checkpoints in Texas and in Houston and
[01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:24.540]  Dallas where they grow up your wife and your family and your children so so now
[01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:28.540]  they're telling us the war on terror is for the returning veterans and gun owners
[01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:34.140]  and libertarians I don't know if you saw those Homeland Security documents I did
[01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:39.860]  hear about that that is just a day blames disgrace I mean that yes you you
[01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:43.060]  know I get you want to get my blood blowing you start messing with that
[01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:48.780]  military would with the with with the veterans they are without them there is
[01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:54.100]  no us and I have been among these people in the last few years our men women
[01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:57.340]  uniform in in some pretty desperate parts of this world I want to tell you
[01:36:57.340 --> 01:37:01.540]  what they're the best we've got the best we got is not on Capitol Hill the best
[01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:06.180]  we've got is in the in the uniform of the United States military they're the
[01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:10.340]  best Americans we got and when I see somebody messing with them it just makes
[01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:15.740]  my it really gets my tinder up higher people who are returning from our wars
[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:20.020]  are heroes and should be treated as heroes and to even for anybody to even
[01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:24.140]  have the arrogance of accusing them after they've gone and put their lives on
[01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:27.700]  the line for this country and somebody comes along and accuses them of being a
[01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:33.300]  terrorist come on man well the bar well the person doing that is obviously the
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:37.180]  un-American terrorist but but that shows they want to bring in this agenda
[01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:41.660]  121 they are scared in these documents my act of Homeland Security it's made big
[01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:45.660]  news if you're a new look through folks this is real gun owners libertarians
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:50.660]  conservatives constitutionalists but number one returning veterans they're
[01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:56.340]  teaching police that they're the biggest terror threat well I just that's just
[01:37:56.340 --> 01:38:02.140]  BS man that's just crazy you know limitation America is not stupid I
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:07.460]  mean I guarantee how many people are gonna believe that that sounds like
[01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:12.420]  something out of a fictional novel some kind that are returning veterans are
[01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:17.140]  terrorists come on nobody's gonna believe that nobody does believe that
[01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:20.620]  of course they said there's people that are just feet that are laying around by
[01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:25.340]  the nose will believe anything you're told but people to get up and go to work
[01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:28.420]  in the morning to make a living for their family good God-fearing people are
[01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:32.020]  not gonna believe that they know that's a bunch of BS the only people that was
[01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:36.260]  say something like that are people that want to overthrow this country they
[01:38:36.260 --> 01:38:40.180]  come in and say constitutionalist and libertarians and conservatives and
[01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:44.780]  veterans are bad that's what you'd expect you know in the 70s of the Russians
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:50.140]  took over exactly well it ain't gonna work we can't let it work there's too
[01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:53.740]  many people out there man it's to me I see too many good people every day they
[01:38:53.740 --> 01:39:02.260]  ain't gonna swallow this do you agree Charlie that's the thing about educating people about this thing

[01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:33.100]  time with Charlie Daniels go ahead hi Alex hello Charlie actually basically
[01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:37.300]  we're all we're in the Soviet system right now it's just soft core because
[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:41.420]  they're because of the Second Amendment they can't really get rough so they're
[01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:45.820]  trying to implement it slowly in spots where they can but the key to all this
[01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:50.300]  is the Second Amendment once the guns are gone the velvet glove comes off and
[01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:53.780]  iron fit to come down and we'll be in a red tear that the world will never see
[01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:59.220]  amen amen you're right we can't let that happen that's the thing I think about you
[01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:03.020]  know that what scares me more so than anything else about this is one more
[01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:08.140]  Supreme Court justice button think about it you've got to so admire my york and
[01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:11.940]  you've got Elena Kagan Elena Kagan should not even be on the Supreme Court

[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:21.340]  going to rule on it that's illegal yes she should or she should have been
[01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:26.220]  refused as you read just you to refuse herself we've got our Constitution is
[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:32.100]  being trapped alone by this government and this administration Charlie what do
[01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:36.260]  you make your cast Sunstein since you said that cast Sunstein is the guy they've
[01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:41.100]  got lined up Obama says that'll be his next nominee cast Sunstein has said I'm
[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:45.500]  not kidding pull this up I can't believe it he said it he wrote papers five years
[01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:50.140]  ago four years ago saying arrest people that don't agree with man-made global
[01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:53.980]  warming or at least find them he is a total authoritarian and that's who
[01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:59.100]  Obama wants and they got to come get me because I think man make love warm I
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:03.420]  don't think man I can't control the climate of this kind of this world
[01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:08.660]  it's stupid if this world is changing it's God's doing it's not ours if it's a
[01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:12.740]  woman it's God's doing it's not man's doing we can't do it we can't control it
[01:41:12.740 --> 01:41:17.340]  and you know we've got it that's just never a stupid anybody that has those
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:21.020]  kind of preconceptions should not even be allowed to go into Supreme Court

[01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:30.740]  should do and basically in response to the NDA a response to the what now the
[01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:38.020]  National Defense Authorization Act the NDA yeah what do you make of Obama
[01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:42.580]  me or him no I mean what do you make of Obama just to be clear with NDA a you
[01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:45.380]  know that's where he says he'll arrest citizens and disappear maybe once I
[01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:50.020]  think you ought to call your congressman your senator Ray Hale with him tell me
[01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:52.380]  can't come back to state if anything that's something like this happens but
[01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:55.420]  that's that's the danger again the Supreme Court says you're right to
[01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:59.540]  never get that's been Congress there's no way to never get it through Congress but
[01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:04.380]  you wait for the supreme I mean that's that's that's what scares me that right
[01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:08.060]  now is one of my biggest fears in this country is the Supreme Court passing
[01:43:08.060 --> 01:43:13.620]  something and the are the Congress you know there's that when you don't read
[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:17.420]  bills if you can't read bills you're in a business up are you both for stuff you
[01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:21.220]  don't even want the heck it is that's gonna fit that's not America that's not
[01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:26.580]  what they're there for we need to get spread away here we need to get we need
[01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:30.420]  people who are going to support our Constitution and people who are going to
[01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:35.700]  support Supreme Court justices that are not left so far in one direction that
[01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:39.900]  they can't possibly think is right way to rule right on things this thing about
[01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:43.980]  arresting people they don't happen we can't let that happen I was about to say
[01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:48.660]  as is that is that they put a bunch of degenerates and crooks in so foreign
[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:52.540]  interest can use America like a vending machine they stick money in pull the
[01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:55.820]  lever get whatever they want out of it let's jam in more calls here in the last
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:44:01.460]  few minutes with Charlie Daniels Doris in Tennessee you're on the air hey I'm
[01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:12.500]  from ten I mean I'm in Nashville right now Charlie Daniels listen I'm really
[01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:17.900]  glad to hear you two link up together I've been a prison planet member for
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:27.180]  since March of 11 and I think that we are completely being taken over if
[01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:31.060]  people don't wake up and they'll listen to people like you and this is sort of
[01:44:31.060 --> 01:44:37.460]  like the Alamo 10 6 would be a Texas without a 10 of 6 I called Lamar
[01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:43.180]  Alexander I call Corker all the time they always tell me exactly what they
[01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:48.820]  told you they will never vote for these things now they just did the transportation
[01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:56.740]  and highway thing and it was a section about firearms and they cut they said
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:45:01.180]  that he didn't vote for that I looked up the votes and they voted yay on it I
[01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:05.060]  don't know he said well he didn't vote for that part well I know this they're
[01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:09.500]  always changing those bills but what I know is in that bill is that the IRS
[01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:13.900]  just says you haven't paid your taxes I mean I've had him come after me and I
[01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:16.820]  know full well I've got mainline accountants and paying all that's you
[01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:20.900]  know stupid tax the fellow reserve and just for them saying you haven't paid
[01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:25.220]  they take your passport away which is a right as a citizen Charlie what do you
[01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:30.100]  think of that I think it's just another paragraph you know it's just like that
[01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:34.620]  they could just keep coming at you from every direction they possibly can how
[01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:38.460]  about this situation we're gonna make kids under what was it 16th with working
[01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:44.060]  on farms oh yeah isn't that brilliant the best way in the world for kids to learn
[01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:48.740]  to work ethic is to get up that farm kids have the best work ethic I used to
[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:52.820]  work on a farm when I was a kid you know kids that drive the kids that are 10
[01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:56.300]  years old on farms do a better job driving a tractor than most people on the
[01:45:56.300 --> 01:46:01.580]  highways do with automobiles well here's the deal my dad exactly my dad
[01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:04.900]  grew up on a farm and I've worked on the family farm we have in ranches nearby
[01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:08.700]  they sent me down down there for a whole year one time but the point is is that
[01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:12.940]  that's what teaches you to act like an adult when you're young and teaches you
[01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:16.620]  responsibility and some of the best workers on those farms or children
[01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:20.380]  they're having a good time and they've got a lot of money in their pockets
[01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:24.940]  instead of playing video games or joining gangs but it shows how they want to
[01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:30.340]  destroy parental control over their children well it ain't gonna happen we
[01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:34.980]  can't let you know somehow some way we got to say our prayers and pull our boat
[01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:40.660]  and leave or we cannot let this happen it's obvious that this is a very a very
[01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:46.300]  clear-cut deal here that we want to go this way that Obama is gonna take us
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:49.740]  and he ain't gonna change you're gonna be worse if you get to take a term is it
[01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:52.660]  going as if are we gonna go this way we're gonna try to go another way we're
[01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:56.860]  gonna take a board to road and you know it's like I don't know anything about I
[01:46:56.860 --> 01:47:00.300]  look like Mitt Romney's gonna run I don't know a whole lot about him but I know he ain't
[01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:04.740]  Obama and I know you know to me I don't endorse political candidates but right
[01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:10.060]  now I would vote for just about anybody but Obama you'd vote for Mickey Mouse over
[01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:16.340]  Obama I'd vote for Mickey Mouse in New York minute yeah we ought to start that
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:20.860]  let's do that Mickey Mouse president yeah over Obama we've got a Mickey we've
[01:47:20.860 --> 01:47:24.380]  got a Mickey Mouse president now what's the difference exactly let's jam in a
[01:47:24.380 --> 01:47:29.740]  few more for Charlie Daniels then he's got to go play the Kentucky Derby let's
[01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:36.620]  go ahead and talk to Don in Texas you're on the air Don Alex I wanted to
[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:40.380]  recommend to you since you've got a musician you're interviewing today a
[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:45.140]  song that nobody knows but they think they do and it's the Star Spangled Banner
[01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:51.780]  the last verse well you know what you're right it does have a last verse but the
[01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:56.060]  thing about it is when you do it nobody wants that last verse because it takes
[01:47:56.060 --> 01:48:00.300]  too long to burn up network time and it won't get home but it's okay you know
[01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:06.020]  but yeah definitely there's a last verse to it and I quickly recite it sure go
[01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:13.140]  ahead oh thus be it ever when free men shall stand between their loved home and
[01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:19.460]  the wars desolation blessed with a victory in peace may the heaven rescued
[01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:25.180]  land praise the power that has made and preserved us a nation the conquer we
[01:48:25.180 --> 01:48:32.900]  must then we cause it is just and thus be our motto in God is our trust yeah
[01:48:32.900 --> 01:48:37.300]  that's why they don't say that and the Star Spangled Banner and triumph shall
[01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:42.180]  wave or the land of the free and the home of the brave everybody needs to
[01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:49.620]  memorize that good verse but you notice it says if our cause is just you see and
[01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:52.860]  and that's why they want to make us corrupt because we lose all of our
[01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:59.500]  providence once we become corrupt yes absolutely yeah well you're on the air
[01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:04.180]  with the guys I'm sorry Charlie go ahead so we're not gonna let this happen we
[01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:07.420]  can't let this happen we're not a caller you're on the Charlie Daniels did you
[01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:12.100]  have a question no I just wanted to since you got a musician on remind you all
[01:49:12.100 --> 01:49:15.700]  of that and all your listeners
[01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:23.540]  the decision is being made by the president and the Joint Chiefs in the
[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:28.340]  war room with the Pentagon when they realized there was no possibility of
[01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:33.860]  recalling the wing will be only one course of action over total commitment
[01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:43.700]  Mandry you recall what Clemens once said about war he said war was too important
[01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:49.540]  to be left to the generals when he said that 50 years ago he might have been
[01:49:49.540 --> 01:49:56.180]  right but today war is too important to be left to politicians they have neither
[01:49:56.180 --> 01:50:04.500]  the time the training or the inclination for strategic thought resistance to
[01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:29.340]  tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones

[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:09.700]  how did you come up with the devil went down to Georgia and how did you come up
[01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:13.540]  with the best fiddle a fiddle and I've ever heard well how you have to disagree
[01:54:13.540 --> 01:54:16.660]  about this one best feeling because I don't consider myself that but the way
[01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:20.900]  we came up down down to Georgia is pretty boring story actually we had we had
[01:54:20.900 --> 01:54:25.860]  written and Rick and rehearsed a whole album's worth of songs to go into an
[01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:30.780]  album and we got into studio and instead of that we need to build came I don't
[01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:33.300]  know why we didn't discover before we went in but we said we didn't build came
[01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:37.140]  so we took a break moved out of the recording studio into a rehearsal
[01:54:37.140 --> 01:54:41.900]  studio and wrote this song I don't know where the idea came from I just you know
[01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:46.060]  which is I read an old poem back in high school a stupid miss but they call
[01:54:46.060 --> 01:54:49.660]  them out and what for will it had to do with Finland and y'all was impressed
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:52.820]  because it was a young fiddle player if that's where the idea came from but I
[01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:56.540]  got this thing devil went out of the origin the guy started chipping in and
[01:54:56.540 --> 01:54:59.780]  here we went the first thing you know went by your studio and recorded it so
[01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:04.420]  it's that not I wish it was a better story about that but it's actually not
[01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:07.580]  well you could always come out with another one but let me ask you this
[01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:11.100]  then it's kind of a bright stuff question where they say well who was the
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:14.380]  greatest fighter pilot you ever knew and he was about to say Chuck Yeager but he
[01:55:14.380 --> 01:55:19.860]  said himself who do you think is the greatest fiddle player living or not
[01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:28.700]  living Johnny Gamble is hard to beat I know you for me with him yes there's
[01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:34.380]  couple guys on the operating or who has to his excellent little player the best
[01:55:34.380 --> 01:55:38.660]  how down fiddle player right now in my opinion is our white place for the
[01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:44.380]  square dance is on the operating hold out feeling almost a wild start nowadays
[01:55:44.380 --> 01:55:47.940]  because there's you know people square dance that much anymore on a grand scale
[01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:52.900]  and some of the guys that I ran into on the road once in a while some of these
[01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:56.860]  young guys are really really good I play kids ask me about playing fiddle I say
[01:55:56.860 --> 01:56:00.660]  don't look at me I hold the bow wrong I hold the fiddle wrong I put too much
[01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:04.580]  pressure on the bow you know but that's my style but it may not work for you
[01:56:04.580 --> 01:56:08.100]  don't you run your violin take your crazy don't do it I don't read music so I
[01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:12.580]  just do it all right I'm gonna jam in two more calls but folks you've got to
[01:56:12.580 --> 01:56:15.540]  just ask your question we've got to go because we've got about two minutes left
[01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:19.540]  here let's talk to Charles in Rhode Island Charles you're on the air with
[01:56:19.540 --> 01:56:23.940]  Charlie Daniels greetings and salutations talk so host extraordinaire
[01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:28.220]  freedom friend mr. Daniels basically this is my question do you really
[01:56:28.220 --> 01:56:33.260]  understand the real crux of the situation here up until 1951 90% of
[01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:37.580]  people paying for tax the government did something very smart and making people
[01:56:37.580 --> 01:56:41.580]  invest in the government so therefore the mindset is they got to collect that
[01:56:41.580 --> 01:56:46.780]  check do you understand that that's what the real mindset is that's the kind
[01:56:46.780 --> 01:56:50.620]  of put him on hold Charlie he's saying the the income tax is unconstitutional
[01:56:50.620 --> 01:56:57.380]  we didn't get it till 1913 what's your take on that well you know I don't mind
[01:56:57.380 --> 01:57:01.460]  paying tax I mean I don't mind paying you know there's no taxes in the jungle
[01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:05.380]  is there I wish I don't mind paying tax but I don't like paying exorbitant taxes
[01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:09.420]  I don't I think we should have a lot more say about how they're spent I don't
[01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:13.540]  like our money being used against us flat I think we should have a flat tax
[01:57:13.540 --> 01:57:19.060]  across the board and you know no detections no nothing that the IRS is
[01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:22.500]  way too big don't need that many people they're doing it give us a flat tax we
[01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:27.140]  can figure your own income tax 10% okay fine here came so this that saying it
[01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:30.060]  didn't be done with well that's the big thing about the income tax is that it
[01:57:30.060 --> 01:57:34.620]  you can go to 50 CPAs money magazine's done this you get 50 different answers

[02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:55.940]  America was taken over we've got to get it that in that message the truth this
[02:02:55.940 --> 02:02:59.540]  isn't the government this is illegitimate and criminal and everything
[02:02:59.540 --> 02:03:03.620]  it's doing is illegal and they're staging terror attacks and they're
[02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:06.580]  bringing the drugs in and they're shipping the guns into Mexico and

[02:03:12.820 --> 02:03:17.540]  mafia took over America the mafia took over America just like they did Italy
[02:03:17.540 --> 02:03:21.220]  but it's a globalist mafia of all different races and creeds and groups
[02:03:21.220 --> 02:03:26.980]  and it's in there keeping people in the dark and it's a mafia so powerful they
[02:03:26.980 --> 02:03:30.860]  hired high-tech scientists to come up with brainwashing and brain damaging
[02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:34.780]  systems and now the mafia is like why don't we just start killing people and
[02:03:34.780 --> 02:03:38.260]  transfer their money to us with the medical treatments and they said yes
[02:03:38.260 --> 02:03:42.580]  we're going to do that and so they're just phasing in and testing now how to
[02:03:42.580 --> 02:03:49.220]  kill us that they are the most evil scum you can imagine I know and that's
[02:03:49.220 --> 02:03:53.740]  what makes my stomach turn Alex it makes me sick that right now all Americans

[02:08:13.220 --> 02:08:20.740]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:08:20.740 --> 02:08:36.220]  Alex Jones everybody knows now there are very few who are in denial
[02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:40.700]  everyone knows that the governments and major banks ship in the majority of
[02:08:40.700 --> 02:08:44.500]  narcotics and even grow and produce them they own the aircraft they ship the
[02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:49.900]  arms in it's all come out in the news over and over again the cocoa plants the
[02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:55.780]  poppies all of it and they keep drugs illegal so that the price will be higher
[02:08:55.780 --> 02:09:01.700]  so people will have to rob your house or rob your wife or rob you to pay it and
[02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:06.300]  that money goes back to the banks then when they catch the low-level zombies
[02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:10.540]  who are on their product they then put them in large private prisons owned by
[02:09:10.540 --> 02:09:16.540]  the big money-wandering banks to then work for 25 cents an hour driving down
[02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:22.780]  wages and displacing your jobs and the good old boys cheer it and they say I
[02:09:22.780 --> 02:09:28.100]  work at the prison I work at the Justice Center and then their own sons in there
[02:09:28.100 --> 02:09:32.940]  and they're proud of it my boys in prison now I'm over him but that's a good
[02:09:32.940 --> 02:09:38.380]  thing that's America he got caught with some of them drugs because the only job
[02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:45.100]  was dealing drugs or running the prison and that's the predatory New World Order
[02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:50.060]  economy Vicente Fox who is a globalist though it's probably pretty sad that his
[02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:54.460]  ranch is overrun down in Mexico and that the criminal government down there's
[02:09:54.460 --> 02:10:00.580]  gonna lose control see they've lost the war with smaller cartels who are the
[02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:04.700]  people are so poor they're ready to die they're not afraid to die pretty macho
[02:10:04.700 --> 02:10:10.780]  down in Mexico I mean it's more people died every year than died in a year times
[02:10:10.780 --> 02:10:15.700]  three times at least three times the people die every year or more in Mexico
[02:10:15.700 --> 02:10:20.140]  in the fake drug war then died it on the US side in the Vietnam War every year
[02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:27.100]  it's 40 something thousand the last three years 58,000 died in over a decade of
[02:10:27.100 --> 02:10:33.060]  Vietnam so do the math and so now they're like ceasefire ceasefire let's
[02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:38.220]  decriminalize this stuff and at the son of America's with all the hookers and
[02:10:38.220 --> 02:10:44.180]  the rest of it with all of this going on the news with the Latin American
[02:10:44.180 --> 02:10:50.940]  leaders was decriminalize stop it they know Europe and some areas has done
[02:10:50.940 --> 02:10:55.940]  this crime rates drop massively people then see drugs as a sad disease not as
[02:10:55.940 --> 02:11:00.700]  sexy associated with money I see the system has a two-prong attack yet now
[02:11:00.700 --> 02:11:04.660]  over 20% of the population of women are higher men close to that school children
[02:11:04.660 --> 02:11:09.420]  over 20% on psychotropic brain damaging drugs when they go haywire and kill
[02:11:09.420 --> 02:11:13.740]  people they just then call for taking our guns and then also push the illegal
[02:11:13.740 --> 02:11:17.020]  drugs on them and the quote US government that means the big banks that
[02:11:17.020 --> 02:11:19.340]  run our government that launder the money and control the Federal Reserve
[02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:24.260]  they said no we're not getting rid of it in fact we're gonna keep shipping guns
[02:11:24.260 --> 02:11:31.740]  into Mexico and Honduras to keep destabilizing things we like it we like
[02:11:31.740 --> 02:11:36.700]  it just fine because the war on drugs is a success corrupt the police imprison
[02:11:36.700 --> 02:11:42.260]  the population bring in drugs kill the people with ODs destroy society have
[02:11:42.260 --> 02:11:47.220]  SWAT teams busting houses kill people kill people's dogs kill insurance
[02:11:47.220 --> 02:11:51.900]  salesman's wrong house corrupt the police you think prohibition 10 years of
[02:11:51.900 --> 02:11:56.220]  alcohol prohibition tripling the size of the mafia corrupting police hundreds
[02:11:56.220 --> 02:11:59.940]  and hundreds of millions made in those days numbers a year you think that was a
[02:11:59.940 --> 02:12:04.820]  success prohibition for the mafia or was it a failure oh no don't make
[02:12:04.820 --> 02:12:13.100]  alcohol illegal that you just made it criminals and domain the government the
[02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:16.660]  feds deal with child molestation rules and kidnapping rules because they
[02:12:16.660 --> 02:12:21.180]  publicly run most the child kidnapping don't make a big deal out of some lone
[02:12:21.180 --> 02:12:25.060]  scumbag but when they're loving little kids on C-130s to be flown to Saudi
[02:12:25.060 --> 02:12:29.340]  Arabia to have their heads beat in with claw hammers and snuff film with shotgun
[02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:33.540]  blast to the head you know what it comes out Italian news reports it German
[02:12:33.540 --> 02:12:36.860]  news reports it they fire the people that report it not because they were
[02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:41.220]  wrong but because US government officials are involved
[02:12:43.180 --> 02:12:47.900]  you got people that like to beat little kids heads in with hammers after they
[02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:54.740]  rape them that's who runs the world okay and go look at what I just said by the
[02:12:54.740 --> 02:12:59.460]  way you're gonna be like that's a true story oh yeah would you like to hear
[02:12:59.460 --> 02:13:06.020]  more it's kind of like Starship troopers on the news would you like to hear more
[02:13:06.020 --> 02:13:09.860]  we take you now to clandestine we take you now to the planet earth where the
[02:13:09.860 --> 02:13:15.060]  crazy people run things the New World Order is insane and I want to bring this
[02:13:15.060 --> 02:13:22.580]  up to top researchers a great researcher Alan White musician author radio
[02:13:22.580 --> 02:13:27.340]  host in his own right cutting the matrix.com I want to get him on with us
[02:13:27.340 --> 02:13:31.140]  and out of the gates here what he has to say today maybe hold him a little bit in
[02:13:31.140 --> 02:13:35.740]  the next hour and take some calls but I wanted to get Alan on today to bring up
[02:13:35.740 --> 02:13:39.860]  this point because I have a theory but it's not really a theory it's kind of
[02:13:39.860 --> 02:13:46.220]  like I have a theory that crawdads come up to the edge of the water and hunt
[02:13:46.220 --> 02:13:51.140]  little frogs and things little crawdads little freshwater lobsters little
[02:13:51.140 --> 02:13:56.820]  freshwater crustaceans it's not a theory I watch them do it I don't have a theory
[02:13:56.820 --> 02:14:05.060]  that ducks fly south in the winter and back north in the spring I know it and
[02:14:05.060 --> 02:14:09.500]  I've studied elites it's like a tropism in every case going back to the
[02:14:09.500 --> 02:14:14.340]  beginnings of civilization every culture built pyramids and in sacrifice
[02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:19.460]  children on top of them every day every culture eight children every culture
[02:14:19.460 --> 02:14:26.580]  tortured people what is that that's what cultures always end in is because
[02:14:26.580 --> 02:14:30.740]  psychopath inbred crazy people keep inbreeding they're the ones that are
[02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:33.980]  like cancer they're willing to do whatever to have power they lust after
[02:14:33.980 --> 02:14:38.060]  it and then something happens they interbreed which in every mammal species
[02:14:38.060 --> 02:14:46.420]  causes crazy behavior antisocial behavior megalomania aggression a sense of
[02:14:46.420 --> 02:14:52.060]  psycho domination masochistic blood lust blood thirst every culture study
[02:14:52.060 --> 02:14:56.260]  history but then something worse happens syphilis has been with humans as long
[02:14:56.260 --> 02:15:00.580]  as we've been on this planet syphilis basically microscopic worms that eat
[02:15:00.580 --> 02:15:07.180]  your brain and almost all elites that have been studied had syphilitic brains
[02:15:07.180 --> 02:15:12.700]  pharaohs mafia dons British royalty Jack the Ripper the crown prince running
[02:15:12.700 --> 02:15:18.260]  around killing people so you've got syphilitic brains interbreeding with
[02:15:18.260 --> 02:15:23.860]  aggressive dominant people creating hyper psychopathic blood drinking goblin
[02:15:23.860 --> 02:15:28.260]  creatures basically that's what the New World Order is that's why they do this
[02:15:28.260 --> 02:15:34.620]  why does a spider spin a certain web why does a squirrel bury nuts it's
[02:15:34.620 --> 02:15:40.380]  inbred into them normal wholesome people are blind to this because it's so
[02:15:40.380 --> 02:15:46.500]  alien if we can ever admit and discover this historically we wouldn't be doomed
[02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:52.420]  to repeat it all right I take you now to Canada and Alan Watt joining us Alan
[02:15:52.420 --> 02:15:55.260]  what do you think of my statements and what do you think of the the point I
[02:15:55.260 --> 02:15:59.740]  made with the inbreeding and the syphilitic brain overlay oh it's pretty
[02:15:59.740 --> 02:16:05.340]  accurate I mean even Lenin they found out the left part of his brain was pretty
[02:16:05.340 --> 02:16:09.740]  willing to no way when he was when he died and of course it was insane basically
[02:16:09.740 --> 02:16:15.580]  for the last few months so it's a very common thing but it's because we turns
[02:16:15.580 --> 02:16:21.100]  up in the second and third generation of elite where they might all start off as
[02:16:21.100 --> 02:16:26.980]  gangsters or robbers or murderers probably all over the fact and in the
[02:16:26.980 --> 02:16:30.900]  third generation who get the education come along and they start to form their
[02:16:30.900 --> 02:16:36.620]  clubs and then they discuss the normal topics like why are we so different from
[02:16:36.620 --> 02:16:40.980]  all the peasants that we rule over and that they came up with their own theories
[02:16:40.980 --> 02:16:44.940]  and what they came up with of course is there's always been slavery is the
[02:16:44.940 --> 02:16:49.260]  natural thing slavery is a natural thing and the peasants are always in a
[02:16:49.260 --> 02:16:55.260]  different mindset than we are because we're the leisure class and we have
[02:16:55.260 --> 02:16:59.020]  time to think about things that peasant doesn't and then of course the fourth
[02:16:59.020 --> 02:17:01.900]  generation comes along and then it's able to pass and actually can't think
[02:17:01.900 --> 02:17:07.020]  about that he's actually inferior he's low IQ and this goes on for many many
[02:17:07.020 --> 02:17:11.620]  generations and until you hit the present time today you're ruled by the
[02:17:11.620 --> 02:17:16.820]  same descendants a bit near from awful long time awful long time and again if
[02:17:16.820 --> 02:17:20.700]  you study the royalty the Rothschild's all of them generally half the offspring
[02:17:20.700 --> 02:17:25.140]  are locked up in asylums that's the half that survived generally about half die
[02:17:25.140 --> 02:17:31.340]  and the half that live the half are criminally insane it literally be acting
[02:17:31.340 --> 02:17:35.580]  like monkeys and the other half are just psychopathic control freaks the
[02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:39.660]  control freaks we must remember two of these characters like the Rothschilds
[02:17:39.660 --> 02:17:45.860]  belong to their own secret societies and they have them and Benjamin Franklin in
[02:17:45.860 --> 02:17:51.820]  fact joined the couple of them in fact Hellfire Club yeah and one of the
[02:17:51.820 --> 02:17:56.780]  friends to the Ninth Sisters Lodge and he lived the same kind of lifestyle as
[02:17:56.780 --> 02:18:00.580]  it is over in France when you see how much he he was given per month by the
[02:18:00.580 --> 02:18:04.900]  French government and imagine if you come up and end with the parties he had
[02:18:04.900 --> 02:18:11.020]  endless parties and all the top women of the day etc he actually enjoyed that
[02:18:11.020 --> 02:18:16.780]  lifestyle but the thing is corruption has always ruled the world
[02:18:16.780 --> 02:18:20.620]  Charles Galton Darwin said the same thing and he was a another inbred
[02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:25.540]  descended to Charles from Charles Darwin related to the Huxleys of course all
[02:18:25.540 --> 02:18:30.260]  the top names are all related together and he said there's always been slavery
[02:18:30.260 --> 02:18:35.140]  and one form or another and of course democracy is another form of the
[02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:41.020]  disguise slavery and that with income taxes etc property taxes and he says we
[02:18:41.020 --> 02:18:45.100]  are in the process of creating a more efficient form of slavery that was the
[02:18:45.100 --> 02:18:50.860]  1950s well you were seeing the birth pangs as they go through all trading
[02:18:50.860 --> 02:18:54.420]  the public to be terrified that they use the Soviet system as well by the way
[02:18:54.420 --> 02:19:00.020]  and and we were supposed to be called under the threat of power being used
[02:19:00.020 --> 02:19:04.340]  against us it works very effectively to say what terribly well the Soviet Union
[02:19:04.340 --> 02:19:09.620]  and the kill method here isn't taking you at the moment into the streets and
[02:19:09.620 --> 02:19:13.700]  shooting you the kill method is of course as you mentioned earlier is to do
[02:19:13.700 --> 02:19:20.900]  with giving you cancers cancers and various diseases that you're never
[02:19:20.900 --> 02:19:28.060]  fully 100% a fit nobody today is you can't be with inoculations and the
[02:19:28.060 --> 02:19:34.540]  poison foods etc elites don't get those injections they don't and by the way
[02:19:34.540 --> 02:19:38.020]  they brag about how they do it but when you tell the general public about this
[02:19:38.020 --> 02:19:42.260]  they're like oh that's scary I just decide that isn't true and the elites
[02:19:42.260 --> 02:19:46.540]  say see we openly admit we're killing them and they don't care and the
[02:19:46.540 --> 02:19:49.820]  mothers are like that's right I'm taking my kid in again the cancer shot right
[02:19:49.820 --> 02:19:52.420]  now and then the mother will get attention when their kid dies a
[02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:55.660]  horrible death of cancer and that at the end of the day is really what matters
[02:19:55.660 --> 02:19:59.940]  it's like gee can my kid get cancer so I combine the cancer Barbie that's what
[02:19:59.940 --> 02:20:04.980]  they really want a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into
[02:20:04.980 --> 02:20:08.700]  why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my
[02:20:08.700 --> 02:20:13.020]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[02:20:13.020 --> 02:20:16.340]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[02:20:16.340 --> 02:20:20.980]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace
[02:20:20.980 --> 02:20:25.580]  elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be
[02:20:25.580 --> 02:20:30.340]  healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there

[02:25:01.140 --> 02:25:04.900]  even though they're being destroyed by it and that's part of the mind control
[02:25:04.900 --> 02:25:10.780]  Alan Watt continue yeah that's all part of the education in fact they get a
[02:25:10.780 --> 02:25:16.900]  school and social sciences as many names perversely and then a new indoctrination
[02:25:16.900 --> 02:25:21.220]  into the value of life what is the value of life are we more important than
[02:25:21.220 --> 02:25:27.220]  those guys over in the sub Sahara or wherever and and that already indoctrinated
[02:25:27.220 --> 02:25:33.140]  a whole bunch into that death is good but all will mention this too not all
[02:25:33.140 --> 02:25:36.780]  well that's a hoaxley and brave new world where the children are brought
[02:25:36.780 --> 02:25:40.940]  around the dying and they're big big party time and now of course we're
[02:25:40.940 --> 02:25:44.100]  getting into euthanasia now they've already been prepared for a whole
[02:25:44.100 --> 02:25:48.100]  generation has prepared the deaths all right and we should just celebrate it
[02:25:48.100 --> 02:25:51.820]  and and from then it goes on to well why don't we just kill them off earlier
[02:25:51.820 --> 02:25:55.420]  there's too many people or the pensioners will take all the money it's
[02:25:55.420 --> 02:25:59.660]  the cost of fortune to keep them going by on this use of money for us and this is
[02:25:59.660 --> 02:26:03.460]  all happening right now as we speak and that no one really understands how it's
[02:26:03.460 --> 02:26:08.220]  all connected we live through a plan everything from government is still the
[02:26:08.220 --> 02:26:13.860]  same part the same of the long-term agenda depopulation a Sovietized
[02:26:13.860 --> 02:26:18.180]  world technically that's good is it says Sovietized world the first to say
[02:26:18.180 --> 02:26:21.860]  where right now they haven't budgeted everybody to death that they don't like
[02:26:21.860 --> 02:26:25.620]  they're simply doing the soft kill and bringing down the populations globally
[02:26:25.620 --> 02:26:30.820]  and whenever these third world countries sign on to the United Nations and the
[02:26:30.820 --> 02:26:34.020]  bubbles we give them the bubbles are awfully good we've had it used on
[02:26:34.020 --> 02:26:38.300]  ourselves one time a long time ago and they take the bubbles and then they take
[02:26:38.300 --> 02:26:42.820]  the injections from the World Health Organization and immediately the
[02:26:42.820 --> 02:26:48.820]  fertility problems and they have very early cancer on sets and especially in
[02:26:48.820 --> 02:26:53.980]  women too it disrupts her whole hormonal system males as well turn into females
[02:26:53.980 --> 02:26:58.020]  almost and this is a bisphenols the estrogens they've known about the
[02:26:58.020 --> 02:27:02.300]  bisphenols since the late 1800s when they first discovered them and you would
[02:27:02.300 --> 02:27:06.940]  did the public then and the way to till the 1950s they put it into the plastic
[02:27:06.940 --> 02:27:12.180]  bottles plastic pipes everything's plastic and only getting a good daily
[02:27:12.180 --> 02:27:17.180]  dose of it wherever you happen to be so you're under full-scale attack and you
[02:27:17.180 --> 02:27:20.340]  could understand this is not a happenstance thing from one president or
[02:27:20.340 --> 02:27:24.500]  prime minister to the other that there's not a difference between any president or
[02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:29.580]  prime minister that all belong to the same organization worldwide since the late
[02:27:29.580 --> 02:27:34.260]  1800s and that's what Karl quickly talked about in his book Tragedy in Hope
[02:27:34.260 --> 02:27:40.700]  so it's hard for most folk to think that that can continue but it does you
[02:27:40.700 --> 02:27:45.100]  understand how long the Soviet system lasted look at it took a hundred years to
[02:27:45.100 --> 02:27:50.380]  plan the takeover by the Bolsheviks a hundred years before even the first
[02:27:50.380 --> 02:27:55.580]  revolution in Russia these guys are wrong-term players because the world is
[02:27:55.580 --> 02:28:00.140]  a goal and they work intergenerationally to employ and train under
[02:28:00.140 --> 02:28:04.020]  intergenerationally and now of course with the school systems being pretty
[02:28:04.020 --> 02:28:09.740]  well universal in curriculum you've got their own doctrine from school the
[02:28:09.740 --> 02:28:15.340]  education is plummeted since the 50s and definitely the 60s agreed we're not
[02:28:15.340 --> 02:28:20.780]  around page them and the children are simply indoctrinated into socialism and
[02:28:20.780 --> 02:28:26.380]  groupthink and especially in the US individuality is pretty well eradicated
[02:28:26.380 --> 02:28:30.540]  as a nasty thing to be an individual and the United Nations itself has said
[02:28:30.540 --> 02:28:36.060]  their main enemy to the whole agenda is individualism it must be destroyed so
[02:28:36.060 --> 02:28:42.300]  we are living through our plan we've got taxes that we the term are crippling
[02:28:42.300 --> 02:28:47.180]  the public never mind all the taxes on food that they're putting a tax here
[02:28:47.180 --> 02:28:53.580]  and can't across all the food stuffs as well now a value-added tax or GST HST
[02:28:53.580 --> 02:28:57.900]  is not what they call it it's all a value-added tax and we must go into
[02:28:57.900 --> 02:29:01.780]  value-added taxes because when you're signing all the free trade agreements
[02:29:01.780 --> 02:29:06.140]  then you're allowing to import from those countries with which a tax exempt to
[02:29:06.140 --> 02:29:10.500]  the import customs therefore they don't want to lose that money they simply put
[02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:14.060]  that what they're losing on to you and make it up that way through your taxes
[02:29:14.060 --> 02:29:17.340]  that's why they had to bring in value-added taxes for all free trade
[02:29:17.340 --> 02:29:22.060]  countries the US is told to get really hit by that in any significant way
[02:29:22.060 --> 02:29:25.700]  all right stay there stay there Alan but what you're saying here is
[02:29:25.700 --> 02:29:32.020]  empires don't die they just reinvent themselves and this is a secretive
[02:29:32.020 --> 02:29:36.580]  parasite Illuminati cult that's much older than Illuminati that's just one of the
[02:29:36.580 --> 02:29:40.740]  more modern names that understands how to control humans that has advanced
[02:29:40.740 --> 02:29:47.300]  technologies and who basically praise on humanity as a predator class which was

[02:34:11.540 --> 02:34:16.180]  viruses in the vaccines the GMO's designed to sterilize us the elites all
[02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:19.740]  have their own private farms are obsessed with it Wall Street Journal LA

[02:34:43.300 --> 02:34:51.260]  quote clean vaccine that's real I take it personal I get upset last week we
[02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:56.700]  worked real late we're up here at 9 at night and I said guys you've really kicked
[02:34:56.700 --> 02:35:00.420]  some romp we've reached millions of extra people thanks to your work let me
[02:35:00.420 --> 02:35:08.460]  take you out to a Brazilian steakhouse we get there about 9 30 and there is a
[02:35:08.460 --> 02:35:13.980]  child obviously damaged and I go out on the street afterwards and see people
[02:35:13.980 --> 02:35:18.100]  with another child that's got neurological problems and I started
[02:35:18.100 --> 02:35:23.740]  crying and I mean sobbing in front of the guys and they'd never seen anything
[02:35:23.740 --> 02:35:26.980]  like it a few times on there I've kind of thought about something bring up the
[02:35:26.980 --> 02:35:34.100]  image because it gets to me this is a soft kill covert holocaust against
[02:35:34.100 --> 02:35:39.860]  humanity the West is dying 1.3 children for every two adults we're dying it's
[02:35:39.860 --> 02:35:46.020]  painful I'm not just some selfish idiot that wants to go whatever I'm going to
[02:35:46.020 --> 02:35:51.220]  drink beer watch a football game I love beauty I love poetry I love humanity I
[02:35:51.220 --> 02:35:57.060]  love creativity I love the innocence of my children and I want them to have a
[02:35:57.060 --> 02:36:05.140]  future and I think about how we're in the grasp of highly intelligent inbred
[02:36:05.140 --> 02:36:13.220]  super psychos who base their culture on syphilitic hallucinations we're living
[02:36:13.220 --> 02:36:19.700]  in the creation of of of hallucinating syphilitics I mean that's it this is
[02:36:19.700 --> 02:36:25.180]  planet syphilis brain and Hitler it turned out had syphilis all of them
[02:36:25.180 --> 02:36:33.060]  Stalin Lenin all of them rotten brains I mean I now understand it we are
[02:36:33.060 --> 02:36:39.260]  living in the in the in the wonderland of syphilitic crazy people and again
[02:36:39.260 --> 02:36:43.500]  even though they've cured syphilis or the treatments for it by the 40s the
[02:36:43.500 --> 02:36:48.980]  point is the whole culture is set by that inbreeding syphilis this is what
[02:36:48.980 --> 02:36:52.500]  demo side is this is why leaders throughout history right when they have
[02:36:52.500 --> 02:36:57.620]  total control just say black uniforms mass murder burn cities death that that's
[02:36:57.620 --> 02:37:01.860]  what somebody with syphilitic brain rot will just go out and hurt stabbing
[02:37:01.860 --> 02:37:06.340]  people well you give people because again the elite sir you're having sex
[02:37:06.340 --> 02:37:12.980]  with 20 30 women men a day Nero people don't believe it you can look it up in
[02:37:12.980 --> 02:37:18.700]  the history Nero they would have these big day-long parties on holidays that
[02:37:18.700 --> 02:37:22.980]  they had basically every week and his favorite thing to do with all the Roman
[02:37:22.980 --> 02:37:26.780]  elite in his palace is he would dress up like a werewolf they chain up a child
[02:37:26.780 --> 02:37:31.260]  and he'd run up you gotta read deeper to the history because the main linemen's
[02:37:31.260 --> 02:37:35.020]  don't like to put this in there but he'd rape a child in public and then bite
[02:37:35.020 --> 02:37:39.020]  their throats out ripping their arteries out spring blood all over him
[02:37:39.020 --> 02:37:46.580]  dressed up in a wolf's outfit what Caligula after he married his horse you
[02:37:46.580 --> 02:37:50.700]  don't get the full story on that he was married to it you know he made it the
[02:37:50.700 --> 02:37:55.980]  consulate the head of Rome the head of the Roman Senate he would have the high
[02:37:55.980 --> 02:38:00.300]  priest you read tea leaves or they throw bones on the ground or they cut a bull
[02:38:00.300 --> 02:38:06.460]  open and read their liver well he would he would have the high priest and that
[02:38:06.460 --> 02:38:12.300]  was one of the last straws for him read its excrement they all announce
[02:38:12.300 --> 02:38:15.660]  themselves God and that's what Ray Kurzweil and all we're doing oh we're
[02:38:15.660 --> 02:38:19.460]  God we're merging with the computers release the GMO whatever happens is
[02:38:19.460 --> 02:38:22.780]  natural because we did it and it's a mutation they're gonna destroy the
[02:38:22.780 --> 02:38:27.900]  planet okay they're crazy if Nero wants to marry his horse and rip children's
[02:38:27.900 --> 02:38:32.540]  throats out 2,000 years ago or whatever or 1800 years ago or whatever that's
[02:38:32.540 --> 02:38:36.580]  and that's that's bad enough they got nuclear weapons they've got any matter
[02:38:36.580 --> 02:38:40.180]  weapons they've got biological weapons and they're gonna kill everybody
[02:38:40.180 --> 02:38:44.540]  including they're building giant underground bases huge redouts seed
[02:38:44.540 --> 02:38:49.300]  vaults total insanity and everybody that works for these people better start
[02:38:49.300 --> 02:38:53.700]  sabotaging them however you can to resist them and I don't mean physically I
[02:38:53.700 --> 02:38:57.740]  mean you just better start resisting however you can or there's no future
[02:38:57.740 --> 02:39:01.540]  Alan what can you feel the sense of immediacy you've got the floor what do
[02:39:01.540 --> 02:39:05.140]  you say about what I just broke down what's the latest on Alan what cut to
[02:39:05.140 --> 02:39:10.060]  the matrix comms radar screen well they're they're definitely ready for a
[02:39:10.060 --> 02:39:14.140]  big call I mean I mean I mean a physical call as well you look at the
[02:39:14.140 --> 02:39:18.840]  nonsense with the Olympic Games in London you've got a warship and the
[02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:23.420]  Thames you've got a guided missile systems them up against snipers and
[02:39:23.420 --> 02:39:29.180]  helicopters to go over the crowds army snipers I mean this is supposed to be a
[02:39:29.180 --> 02:39:35.380]  peacetime country and everyone is living inside a prison camp this is
[02:39:35.380 --> 02:39:39.420]  something you expect in a prison camp and I mean I'm a real high you know
[02:39:39.420 --> 02:39:45.620]  futuristic prison camp this is not a life for the general public but the
[02:39:45.620 --> 02:39:51.540]  training is we're using these these big games etc to get us all trained through
[02:39:51.540 --> 02:39:55.860]  others who attending the things yourselves are watching on television
[02:39:55.860 --> 02:40:00.260]  that this is the new system be very afraid of the new system because there
[02:40:00.260 --> 02:40:05.100]  are a lot of really nasty stuff to implement socially still yet and the
[02:40:05.100 --> 02:40:08.660]  training that people step by step through fear and to go on us with you I
[02:40:08.660 --> 02:40:16.100]  don't see any any peaceable way out of this because remember quickly said that
[02:40:16.100 --> 02:40:20.100]  these guys have been running all the countries in the West for since the late
[02:40:20.100 --> 02:40:25.340]  1800s with this particular agenda I cannot see them getting up because we
[02:40:25.340 --> 02:40:30.780]  asked them nicely I can't see them getting up if you can try to run your
[02:40:30.780 --> 02:40:34.780]  own guys in there and into the offices of the presidency can't see happening
[02:40:34.780 --> 02:40:40.260]  it's never happened in a hundred years it's always their boy gets in and so
[02:40:40.260 --> 02:40:44.260]  you're living through an agenda as I say but at the top of the tree above even
[02:40:44.260 --> 02:40:50.100]  a syphilitics you have another group who do run the banking system their names
[02:40:50.100 --> 02:40:53.220]  are generally never mentioned much in the papers at all because they're not
[02:40:53.220 --> 02:40:57.260]  open to the public they're not really public figures and they have their own
[02:40:57.260 --> 02:41:00.580]  particular agenda but you've got to go back as it's two ancient times to the
[02:41:00.580 --> 02:41:04.860]  present in this particular society has always said and Albert Pike said this
[02:41:04.860 --> 02:41:09.220]  and he's on book moral and dogma for the mason's the Bible of remissionary at the
[02:41:09.220 --> 02:41:14.780]  time he said he said those who will not use their own intellect to think for
[02:41:14.780 --> 02:41:21.060]  themselves are therefore meet on the table and beasts of burden by choice and
[02:41:21.060 --> 02:41:26.260]  consent now that really is was taught to all the elite generation to generation
[02:41:26.260 --> 02:41:30.420]  that's a simple explanation they claim as to why you're all down there and they
[02:41:30.420 --> 02:41:36.740]  are there you see you are you're inferior species you are slaves and and you
[02:41:36.740 --> 02:41:40.020]  never complain if you complain it's always petitions and please please please
[02:41:40.020 --> 02:41:44.460]  to a bunch of wolves and you get nothing done and return for it doesn't work
[02:41:44.460 --> 02:41:49.420]  obviously so they know they're getting to a step where you understand democracy
[02:41:49.420 --> 02:41:53.660]  even as the first I call it first it's never been democracy but the first of
[02:41:53.660 --> 02:41:58.380]  democracy is to be eliminated altogether eventually in the plan society
[02:41:58.380 --> 02:42:03.580]  where you have your own communitarian areas like they have in Britain they've
[02:42:03.580 --> 02:42:07.460]  got regions set up in the states as well they take power away from your local
[02:42:07.460 --> 02:42:11.340]  education authorities they give it to the to the state or even between three
[02:42:11.340 --> 02:42:16.020]  states so it gets further and further away the ability for the ordinary person
[02:42:16.020 --> 02:42:20.380]  to go and complain about anything to a politician or a representative or an
[02:42:20.380 --> 02:42:24.540]  official goes further and further away and that trains you that it is remote
[02:42:24.540 --> 02:42:28.980]  it is remote until eventually you don't even think about complaining to them
[02:42:28.980 --> 02:42:32.020]  it's just it's out of the question you take it for granted you're now simply
[02:42:32.020 --> 02:42:38.380]  ruled by experts and scientists and that's how they've already trained the
[02:42:38.380 --> 02:42:41.460]  youngsters youngsters today are only trained in this they're getting that at
[02:42:41.460 --> 02:42:48.380]  school and it's a better way they claim and they can do a way eventually with
[02:42:48.380 --> 02:42:52.780]  elections all together technocracy is a techniques now we've watched in Europe
[02:42:52.780 --> 02:42:56.460]  they place their own boys from the central bank of Europe it right into
[02:42:56.460 --> 02:43:02.020]  countries as the prime ministers no election that's to happen elsewhere too
[02:43:02.020 --> 02:43:05.660]  and in the states as well I think in the US though they'll have a lot more
[02:43:05.660 --> 02:43:11.140]  trouble they do expect resistance more really we only expect the states such
[02:43:11.140 --> 02:43:17.340]  as simple not even rebellion at being a personal level when people start losing
[02:43:17.340 --> 02:43:21.660]  their homes on mass that type of thing or they've been told there'd be no more
[02:43:21.660 --> 02:43:26.180]  private property under agenda 21 and you simply burn your house down with you in
[02:43:26.180 --> 02:43:31.260]  it or you evacuate so that's really what's happening so in the US there
[02:43:31.260 --> 02:43:41.420]  will be rag tag sporadic uncoordinated non-disciplined rebellion on small
[02:43:41.420 --> 02:43:45.660]  levels but look what they're ready for look at the ammunition they ordered in
[02:43:45.660 --> 02:43:51.220]  for the whole man security for close quarter battle you don't use a pistol
[02:43:51.220 --> 02:43:57.780]  dumb dumb bullets hollow points for overseas you can't use them overseas
[02:43:57.780 --> 02:44:02.100]  against other armies you can only use them on your own population but they
[02:44:02.100 --> 02:44:07.420]  put 750 million rounds ordered what do you think that's for what do the people
[02:44:07.420 --> 02:44:13.420]  out there think that is for it's not for target practice it's too expensive for
[02:44:13.420 --> 02:44:18.020]  target practice you use the ordinary rounds for that it's as simply for it to
[02:44:18.020 --> 02:44:22.620]  be used on the public so the leader are taking no chances whatsoever that
[02:44:22.620 --> 02:44:27.500]  anything possibly could go wrong but it also is very ominous because you're
[02:44:27.500 --> 02:44:33.220]  looking at a war situation where those who will represent government just like
[02:44:33.220 --> 02:44:38.140]  the henchmen in the Soviet Union will that you might always make sure that and
[02:44:38.140 --> 02:44:40.940]  they do the select the guys the pre-select the guys out of the armies
[02:44:40.940 --> 02:44:45.380]  you know every every soldiers get them psychological tests on the way and they
[02:44:45.380 --> 02:44:49.260]  know the ones and how many of them they can count on to be the new Soviet army
[02:44:49.260 --> 02:44:53.580]  in America that's right and the ones that are good they send them to fight the
[02:44:53.580 --> 02:44:57.180]  insurgents that are actually financed by the bankers and it's a full spectrum
[02:44:57.180 --> 02:45:04.060]  dominance false system where they see an excuse to be in a country so they fund
[02:45:04.060 --> 02:45:08.260]  both sides to create the fake war and then the ones that like to be psychopaths
[02:45:08.260 --> 02:45:12.220]  and dominate and control everybody they bring them back here and put them in
[02:45:12.220 --> 02:45:16.860]  command to do and they've been doing that for years now every every person
[02:45:16.860 --> 02:45:20.820]  who applies to be a police officer psychological evaluation they don't want
[02:45:20.820 --> 02:45:27.100]  to want an IQ over 95 or 90 90 98 but they want the brute force type ones the
[02:45:27.100 --> 02:45:31.740]  ones who get off on slaughter and power and watching civilians quiver in front
[02:45:31.740 --> 02:45:35.860]  of them and that's the type they've been employing that very deliberately
[02:45:35.860 --> 02:45:40.180]  remember everything is nothing is happenstance okay well let me say this to
[02:45:40.180 --> 02:45:44.540]  you because because I know they're scientific they study every facet for
[02:45:44.540 --> 02:45:50.020]  the military industrial complex but but the globalists are not invincible I
[02:45:50.020 --> 02:45:54.860]  mean give me your take on that it depends how you see it understand most of
[02:45:54.860 --> 02:45:59.540]  what's happening today is through almost perfect conditioning generation by
[02:45:59.540 --> 02:46:05.500]  generation through the school system is taken over by entertainment and and
[02:46:05.500 --> 02:46:11.380]  television and and people are pretty well perfectly conditioned they really
[02:46:11.380 --> 02:46:14.580]  will adapt to almost anything they know despite the studies they've done
[02:46:14.580 --> 02:46:18.700]  already that the public the general public will adapt to almost every
[02:46:18.700 --> 02:46:22.900]  situation that you let me stop you right there I was on an airplane and even
[02:46:22.900 --> 02:46:26.180]  wrote his name down and told Ted Anderson about it and he looked at it on
[02:46:26.180 --> 02:46:30.580]  his iPhone and then later I lost the guy's name but he was one of the
[02:46:30.580 --> 02:46:37.340]  managing director presidents of one of the biggest banks in New York and I
[02:46:37.340 --> 02:46:41.060]  was being flown up there to be on the view so I was in first class with him
[02:46:41.060 --> 02:46:45.940]  he'd come to Austin to visit his dad that was a retired general and he knew
[02:46:45.940 --> 02:46:50.660]  who I was I later learned in the talk and he said look people will muddle
[02:46:50.660 --> 02:46:55.660]  through anything whatever we do they'll just adapt to it and we basically use
[02:46:55.660 --> 02:47:00.820]  that against him and and and I told him no humanity will prevail it's kind of
[02:47:00.820 --> 02:47:05.180]  like Winston talking to O'Brien but Alan I'm gonna be honest with you there's
[02:47:05.180 --> 02:47:10.300]  only one area with you that I don't totally agree with you and that's that
[02:47:10.300 --> 02:47:14.580]  that they've got their act completely together they have general programs they
[02:47:14.580 --> 02:47:18.460]  studied things they're worried about the wild card individual you've talked
[02:47:18.460 --> 02:47:22.260]  about that but I've also heard you talk about you know the elite will give us
[02:47:22.260 --> 02:47:27.540]  leaders and the elite will do all this well I know I'm for real I know that I
[02:47:27.540 --> 02:47:31.620]  came out of nowhere by the you know going to access TV and stuff like that I
[02:47:31.620 --> 02:47:36.380]  know you're for real and not controlled and I know so many other people in the
[02:47:36.380 --> 02:47:40.420]  system itself not just independence like us that don't like what's happening and
[02:47:40.420 --> 02:47:45.340]  I do see a bigger awakening and I do see victories you know people can't believe
[02:47:45.340 --> 02:47:49.380]  I snuck into Bohemian Grove they think it must have been fake people can't
[02:47:49.380 --> 02:47:53.860]  believe that you know other stuff like they think my David Gergen is is fake
[02:47:53.860 --> 02:47:57.780]  well no they never just went and stood outside the main entrance to Madison
[02:47:57.780 --> 02:48:02.100]  Square Garden during the RNC in 2004 knowing big wigs would come in to
[02:48:02.100 --> 02:48:06.140]  confront them I mean that's not rocket science to know okay there's one of the
[02:48:06.140 --> 02:48:10.340]  back entrances where all the VIPs are coming in let's sit here and eat hot
[02:48:10.340 --> 02:48:15.780]  dogs you know to stand for an hour and see at the time smoked cigarettes see
[02:48:15.780 --> 02:48:19.980]  who comes in here hey that's David Gergen let's get him people who sit there
[02:48:19.980 --> 02:48:24.960]  on the bench cannot imagine men of action so all I'm saying is people have
[02:48:24.960 --> 02:48:29.060]  to believe they can take action because I know laying down is not going to do
[02:48:29.060 --> 02:48:34.860]  anything I mean what do you say to that well they know consistently the 80 or
[02:48:34.860 --> 02:48:40.100]  percent of the public will do nothing and again they've got all the statistics
[02:48:40.100 --> 02:48:42.980]  there are other countries that measured it did it with the Soviet Union
[02:48:42.980 --> 02:48:47.580]  Durasinski said at the time he says he says you can beat them you can you can
[02:48:47.580 --> 02:48:51.540]  starve them he says will the turn around and fight he says no he says they'll eat
[02:48:51.540 --> 02:48:56.060]  each other now that wasn't the first time in history that's happened with
[02:48:56.060 --> 02:49:01.700]  overwhelming force but the public here haven't seen that you can read about
[02:49:01.700 --> 02:49:05.860]  the brutality on the casual individual we see them tasering folk when they're
[02:49:05.860 --> 02:49:10.140]  down unconscious that kind of stuff we see them kicking punching them but again
[02:49:10.140 --> 02:49:14.940]  we always take it as to be the isolated incident you see it hasn't happened to
[02:49:14.940 --> 02:49:21.020]  most people yet and because of that they still think it's being exaggerated
[02:49:21.020 --> 02:49:25.620]  but when these cases come on television or the internet or whatever it's not
[02:49:25.620 --> 02:49:30.260]  happened to them then they'll actually do all they can to try and keep
[02:49:30.260 --> 02:49:35.740]  normalcy even though you're going through an abnormal situation and to keep
[02:49:35.740 --> 02:49:41.220]  the illusion of law and order while they break the law absolutely at the top
[02:49:41.220 --> 02:49:46.220]  which was honest about it they break the law all the time at the top and and so
[02:49:46.220 --> 02:49:51.860]  many ways I mean if the American people truly were American people maybe the
[02:49:51.860 --> 02:49:56.460]  American person of today is not the American person of the 1950s or 40s
[02:49:56.460 --> 02:50:00.780]  they would not put up with this what's happening today well that's the hormones
[02:50:00.780 --> 02:50:05.460]  I mean that's the hormones as you know people eat in compared to the 50s diet a
[02:50:05.460 --> 02:50:08.540]  lot healthier now and they're a lot more obese that's on record they're just
[02:50:08.540 --> 02:50:13.860]  killing us with the hormones and they love it it's and it's fun yeah and but
[02:50:13.860 --> 02:50:18.900]  also is to do with a massive education if you were ever to try and truly alter
[02:50:18.900 --> 02:50:22.940]  the main thing I mean Lenin said the same things down to it too you must pay
[02:50:22.940 --> 02:50:27.260]  your police your military and your teachers the best amounts of money and
[02:50:27.260 --> 02:50:32.700]  take care of them because the teachers especially train the next generation then
[02:50:32.700 --> 02:50:36.980]  doctrine eight the next generation in the agenda it's not the same agenda it's
[02:50:36.980 --> 02:50:40.500]  updated just like a computer gets up and by the way I saw this article where a
[02:50:40.500 --> 02:50:44.980]  six-year-old girl will talk about we get back briefly they don't let the
[02:50:44.980 --> 02:50:48.540]  parents discipline their children then the kids get out of control then they
[02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:53.900]  handcuff you taser you put you in a mental institution it's like only the
[02:50:53.900 --> 02:50:59.300]  warrior ants can engage in discipline it's ending parenthood we'll be right

[02:57:13.780 --> 02:57:17.660]  gonna tase her on her handcuff them and they're charging her with resisting and
[02:57:17.660 --> 02:57:20.500]  now want to put her in the juvenile hall where she'll probably get gang raped

[02:57:23.820 --> 02:57:27.900]  but tell us briefly again it's a sovietization they use these techniques

[02:57:33.180 --> 02:57:37.300]  well pretty well everything is happening as sovietization the
[02:57:37.300 --> 02:57:41.500]  regionalism that the free trade agreement all came out of the Council
[02:57:41.500 --> 02:57:44.220]  of Foreign Relations the Council of Foreign Relations is one of the main
[02:57:44.220 --> 02:57:48.740]  spearheads to control all of this in the US and across the world too they run the
[02:57:48.740 --> 02:57:54.780]  EU Parliament and they post on their own website in Britain that was their
[02:57:54.780 --> 02:57:59.420]  members that brought in the personal income tax and the property tax in the
[02:57:59.420 --> 02:58:04.180]  States and in Britain I mean these guys want to bring in their plan society
[02:58:04.180 --> 02:58:08.780]  which they rule over totally with peasants going back to renting and of
[02:58:08.780 --> 02:58:11.820]  course to get the cash for renting you've got to be very politically correct
[02:58:11.820 --> 02:58:15.940]  look at interviews I get lots of folk tell me about interviews now it's all
