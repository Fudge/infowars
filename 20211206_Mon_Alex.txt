[00:00.000 --> 00:28.400]  I'd like to report that later today I'll be signing the bill, America and China.
[00:28.400 --> 00:33.840]  I said that yesterday, we need to cut costs.
[00:33.840 --> 00:34.840]  Are you okay?
[00:34.840 --> 00:40.240]  Well, I have is a one and a half year old grandson who had a cold, who likes to kiss his
[00:40.240 --> 00:41.240]  pop.
[00:41.240 --> 00:45.760]  And he'd been kissing in my, anyway, so, but it's just a cold.
[00:45.760 --> 00:50.400]  Deep State announces plan to remove Biden from office.
[00:50.400 --> 00:54.480]  And just like that, you wondered how they would begin the announcement.
[00:54.480 --> 00:59.360]  We're going to have Kamala Harris step in and Pete Buttigieg is a member of the cabinet,
[00:59.360 --> 01:03.920]  transportation department, and he'll be the first gay vice president.
[01:03.920 --> 01:05.600]  So we've got to accept it.
[01:05.600 --> 01:08.600]  I would imagine we've probably had excellent presidents who were gay.
[01:08.600 --> 01:12.080]  We just didn't know which ones you believe that we've had a gay commander in chief.
[01:12.080 --> 01:19.720]  I mean, statistically, it's almost certain the first black president Oh, after Obama,
[01:19.720 --> 01:24.760]  I don't think that it's completely impossible for Kamala Harris to improve her image and
[01:24.760 --> 01:29.880]  put herself in a potentially winnable position going forward, but it has to be activated
[01:29.880 --> 01:32.080]  and done with a plan, right?
[01:32.080 --> 01:34.040]  She certainly has been sent on suicide missions.
[01:34.040 --> 01:38.800]  I mean, the one we just talked about immigration, she went, they said Kamala down to the border
[01:38.800 --> 01:43.320]  to basically deal with a nearly impossible problem to rectify at this point in time.
[01:43.320 --> 01:51.400]  Harris and Buttigieg under the spotlight amid uncertainty over Biden's future is suddenly
[01:51.400 --> 01:52.400]  it's in the news.
[01:52.400 --> 01:57.480]  Washington Post admits Biden may not be the nominee in 2024 looks to Pete Buttigieg and
[01:57.480 --> 02:04.240]  Kamala Harris, both super unpopular, but both minions of the globalists.
[02:04.240 --> 02:06.520]  That's their plan, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06.520 --> 02:10.800]  Now how do you take somebody like Biden who's been their puppet and who's taken all the
[02:10.800 --> 02:14.720]  blame for their globalist agenda, and who was a horrible person in his own right, but
[02:14.720 --> 02:18.680]  now not mentally even cognizant of his own actions?
[02:18.680 --> 02:23.880]  The president asked me to be in charge of managing that piece, then President Trump,
[02:23.880 --> 02:29.400]  excuse me, Freudian slip, that was the last president he caused anyway.
[02:29.400 --> 02:33.280]  And how do you take that and turn it into a winner for your agenda?
[02:33.280 --> 02:35.120]  Well, you assassinate him.
[02:35.120 --> 02:38.400]  You assassinate him when you blame it on the terrorist.
[02:38.400 --> 02:41.120]  You blame it on the American people.
[02:41.120 --> 02:46.280]  You blame it on the group that he identified as the terrorist in January when he stole
[02:46.280 --> 02:47.280]  his way into office.
[02:47.280 --> 02:53.040]  And then again, in June, when he officially put out the national terrorism position of
[02:53.040 --> 02:57.960]  the U.S. government and directive that no longer is radical Islam or the communist Chinese
[02:57.960 --> 03:03.600]  or the Mexican drug cartels or any of those other organizations, not the human smugglers.
[03:03.600 --> 03:08.960]  Not the fentanyl killing hundreds of thousands of years, maiming millions, none of that is
[03:08.960 --> 03:09.960]  a problem.
[03:09.960 --> 03:14.640]  The number one threat is people that question lockdowns and people that question election
[03:14.640 --> 03:20.840]  fraud and people that protest drag queen story time and pedophile story time and critical
[03:20.840 --> 03:26.720]  race theory and communism being taught via the National Education Association through
[03:26.720 --> 03:28.440]  school districts.
[03:28.440 --> 03:35.520]  And just like we saw the assassination of Lincoln back in the 1860s, leading to a decade
[03:35.520 --> 03:41.200]  of martial law really nationwide, not just in the south and reconstruction and that many
[03:41.200 --> 03:45.920]  civil war that went on for decades, they want the same thing here.
[03:45.920 --> 03:50.600]  And if you don't see that in the tea leaves, if you don't see that written on the wall
[03:50.600 --> 03:56.160]  like Ezekiel saw it writing on the wall, I mean, if you don't see their next move, well,
[03:56.160 --> 03:59.600]  you're blind.
[03:59.600 --> 04:25.600]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 Infowars has been banned, arrested, abducted, attacked and threatened
[04:25.600 --> 04:26.600]  because we are effective.
[04:26.600 --> 04:27.600]  The great awakening is here.
[04:27.600 --> 04:28.600]  Go to banned.video.
[04:28.600 --> 04:29.600]  Download the videos and share.
[04:29.600 --> 04:30.600]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com.
[04:30.600 --> 04:31.600]  And never give up the fight.
[04:31.600 --> 04:32.600]  The fight.
[04:32.600 --> 04:33.600]  The fight.
[04:33.600 --> 04:34.600]  The fight.
[04:34.600 --> 04:35.600]  The fight.
[04:35.600 --> 05:04.480]  I have a question to ask you.
[05:04.480 --> 05:10.240]  Why would you spend your money this Christmas season to buy gifts for friends and family
[05:10.240 --> 05:16.160]  and loved ones with the establishment, with the big corporations that are dedicated to
[05:16.160 --> 05:22.880]  waging war on all of our freedoms and suppressing us and forcing medical tyranny on us?
[05:22.880 --> 05:25.040]  I've never backed down to tyranny.
[05:25.040 --> 05:27.360]  We've had incredible successes fighting them.
[05:27.360 --> 05:28.880]  Thanks for your support.
[05:28.880 --> 05:35.960]  But now, as 2021 comes to a close, I want to encourage you now more than ever to support
[05:35.960 --> 05:36.960]  the truth.
[05:36.960 --> 05:40.960]  And you do that at infowarstore.com.
[05:40.960 --> 05:45.720]  Storewide free shipping, double-patriot points running right now, huge deals of bottom mineral
[05:45.720 --> 05:49.440]  fusion, DNA force plus, and lung cleanse, and turbo force.
[05:49.440 --> 05:54.000]  And these are really amazing, high-quality products that also fund the info war.
[05:54.000 --> 06:20.000]  The only way you fail is not taking action.
[06:20.000 --> 06:48.800]  From the infowar.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:50.640 --> 07:00.880]  And of course, we witnessed last week the American Heart Association having their post
[07:00.880 --> 07:07.440]  on Twitter blocked saying, you're not allowed to make medical statements, only the WHO and
[07:07.440 --> 07:10.560]  Fauci are.
[07:10.560 --> 07:19.960]  Isn't that just incredible to live in a world where the United Nations is in full control?
[07:19.960 --> 07:26.840]  Not so they can build some Star Trek future, like they always claim they want to, but a
[07:26.840 --> 07:35.720]  nightmare, dehumanization, technocracy for those that are even able to survive the great
[07:35.720 --> 07:39.240]  culling that is now unfolding here on Earth.
[07:39.240 --> 07:53.360]  You're a TV viewer, you can see in front of me one, two, three stacks.
[07:53.360 --> 07:57.120]  Because everybody's talking about Gisela and Maxwell, and now you can't get any news about
[07:57.120 --> 07:59.120]  her trial.
[07:59.120 --> 08:07.160]  At least everybody who's awake is, mainstream news is barely even covering it.
[08:07.160 --> 08:13.600]  But we're all hearing about Cuomo, aren't we ladies and gentlemen?
[08:13.600 --> 08:23.560]  We're all hearing about Cuomo over and over and over and over again.
[08:23.560 --> 08:38.520]  Chris Cuomo might have an allegation.
[08:38.520 --> 08:47.480]  Not even there's an allegation of sexual harassment, might have an allegation of sexual harassment.
[08:47.480 --> 08:54.360]  Hearing about his brother and he helping cover up 20 plus thousand deliberate deaths in the
[08:54.360 --> 08:58.800]  nursing homes where they would get people sick by sending COVID patients in and not
[08:58.800 --> 09:04.080]  give them treatment, only intubate them to get $53,000 per person they murdered, no,
[09:04.080 --> 09:05.480]  no, no, no, no, no, no.
[09:05.480 --> 09:06.480]  That's not a crime.
[09:06.480 --> 09:11.680]  No, let's distract from the Gisela and Maxwell trial and let's distract from everything coming
[09:11.680 --> 09:15.800]  out there with the firing of Chris Cuomo.
[09:15.800 --> 09:24.600]  And have Brian Stelter all of their sanctimoniously now stabbing his former colleague in the back.
[09:24.600 --> 09:29.560]  All of the CNN hosts and the ABC hosts and all of them are guilty.
[09:29.560 --> 09:34.200]  Remember the Project Veritas video they got of the ABC news anchor, in fact, grab that
[09:34.200 --> 09:35.520]  report from last year, guys.
[09:35.520 --> 09:41.280]  No, it's actually 2019, it came out, late 2019, almost two years ago, about two years
[09:41.280 --> 09:45.720]  ago, it was December, if I remember correctly, and she's sitting back laughing going, I
[09:45.720 --> 09:51.040]  would have loved to get that big story, boy, I'd be famous if I got even more famous, but
[09:51.040 --> 09:54.080]  they wouldn't let me run with it because it dealt with pedophilia and little children
[09:54.080 --> 09:56.560]  in the Clintons.
[09:56.560 --> 10:00.160]  And she's not upset about the children.
[10:00.160 --> 10:03.800]  She's upset that the story got spiked when it would have been the number one story in
[10:03.800 --> 10:04.800]  the world.
[10:04.800 --> 10:09.160]  She didn't care about actually saving children, she wanted to break the story because it would
[10:09.160 --> 10:19.440]  make her, as a tart, more money.
[10:19.440 --> 10:26.280]  But remember she laughed and she joked, the ABC anchor about, it was an NBC national anchor,
[10:26.280 --> 10:32.920]  brags about, or actually whistle blows is how they spun it, but leaked video was the headline.
[10:32.920 --> 10:38.960]  That was ABC, it was Project Veritas, ABC's Amy Robach, frustrated on Hot Mike that
[10:38.960 --> 10:43.560]  network quashed every Epstein story.
[10:43.560 --> 10:49.720]  Yeah, we'll grab that and play that coming up.
[10:49.720 --> 10:58.320]  But in my stacks here, even from declassified documents and government admissions, I have
[10:58.320 --> 11:00.760]  why they're really abusing children.
[11:00.760 --> 11:12.040]  This isn't like some unorganized program where it's just rich people in their basements having
[11:12.040 --> 11:16.640]  sex and killing children, torturing children to death.
[11:16.640 --> 11:26.120]  It's a whole systematic combine and a program like a college is an institution of higher
[11:26.120 --> 11:27.120]  learning.
[11:27.120 --> 11:34.800]  Well, the intelligence agencies at the top and these major so-called institutions are
[11:34.800 --> 11:41.440]  universities you go to on how to be soulless and how to abuse people and how to be compromised
[11:41.440 --> 11:46.840]  and then if you're completely, totally soulless and compromised, then you get promoted in
[11:46.840 --> 11:52.720]  positions of power because you've shown you have no bottom.
[11:52.720 --> 11:58.480]  And so I've had a lot of requests by some of the larger podcasters in the world to come
[11:58.480 --> 12:03.520]  on their shows very soon and now that all this is broken exactly as I said it did.
[12:03.520 --> 12:08.560]  And so I happened just this morning with the crew, spent about 30 minutes repulling just
[12:08.560 --> 12:13.800]  a few stories of total admissions of the government grabbing children out of their backyards,
[12:13.800 --> 12:18.800]  taking them and raping them for years on end and reprogramming them with drugs and electroshock
[12:18.800 --> 12:23.000]  therapy and then giving them new identities and then sending them to college and even training
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.040]  them and then putting them in government.
[12:25.040 --> 12:30.760]  You know, the Manchurian candidate is not just a book that got made into a film with
[12:30.760 --> 12:31.760]  Frank Sinatra.
[12:31.760 --> 12:42.800]  It's a pretty good movie and then remade back in the 2000s.
[12:42.800 --> 12:45.200]  It's something that's really going on.
[12:45.200 --> 12:50.960]  So this is in industrial level mind control.
[12:50.960 --> 12:55.720]  Gary Frans, he's going to be in studio, owner of the Next Network, good friend of mine, known
[12:55.720 --> 12:57.320]  him over 16 years.
[12:57.320 --> 12:59.560]  He's visiting here and telling me at dinner last night, he's going to be in studio with
[12:59.560 --> 13:02.360]  us the second hour, cover just the waterfront.
[13:02.360 --> 13:07.440]  And then in the third hour we have a whistleblower coming on from the UK, it's part of a big film
[13:07.440 --> 13:13.200]  coming out, where they used COVID as the cover last year before they'd really taken hold
[13:13.200 --> 13:19.160]  of their bio weapon, this year it's been very real, to kill old people and euthanize them
[13:19.160 --> 13:23.920]  or give them a quote, good death is translated from euthanize.
[13:23.920 --> 13:27.440]  So that is coming up as well.
[13:27.440 --> 13:34.080]  Couple of announcements, I really never do this, I never push back projects, but I decided
[13:34.080 --> 13:38.760]  to do it just because I made the decision last week to shoot even more information and more
[13:38.760 --> 13:45.200]  material for this six hour plus course, mind wars, spirit wars, spirit wars, mind wars,
[13:45.200 --> 13:51.640]  it's interchangeable, but the technical title is reset wars, spirit wars, mind wars.
[13:51.640 --> 13:56.760]  And just so much is going on, I decided to shoot even more and add even more to it to
[13:56.760 --> 14:01.080]  where it's really a six plus hour documentary.
[14:01.080 --> 14:08.880]  And deals with, okay, we know what they're doing to us, how do we brainwash ourselves?
[14:08.880 --> 14:14.480]  Because if you don't set the clock in your mind, somebody else is going to be in there
[14:14.480 --> 14:15.480]  doing it.
[14:15.480 --> 14:22.520]  And so this is really explosive information in this presentation, in this masterclass.
[14:22.520 --> 14:33.520]  So that is coming up and was going to be released tomorrow at 7 p.m. on December 7th.
[14:33.520 --> 14:37.640]  But I have decided, because we're not even done with it, I made the decision to add a
[14:37.640 --> 14:45.080]  bunch of stuff, that it'll be done tomorrow and then it'll be uploaded and ready and we're
[14:45.080 --> 14:52.400]  going to launch it at 7 p.m. at night on Monday, December 13th.
[14:52.400 --> 14:59.400]  And that is when it will be released at resetwars.com for those of you that want to go there and
[14:59.400 --> 15:01.640]  sign up for the class resetwars.com.
[15:01.640 --> 15:06.440]  And if you want updates and all the rest of it, and for 48 hours before, there's going
[15:06.440 --> 15:08.440]  to be a 25% discount.
[15:08.440 --> 15:13.000]  So you'll be able to get that if you sign up on Friday or Saturday, Sunday, or I guess
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.440]  Friday at midnight, through Saturday, through Sunday at midnight at resetwars.com.
[15:17.440 --> 15:21.080]  There will also be a lot of other videos and reports and special interviews and things
[15:21.080 --> 15:23.400]  that are surrounding it.
[15:23.400 --> 15:27.240]  You'll learn all about it coming up by Wednesday and Thursday.
[15:27.240 --> 15:29.760]  I'm going to start giving you specifics about resetwars.
[15:29.760 --> 15:34.440]  And that's the other thing is you don't work this hard on something for over six months.
[15:34.440 --> 15:39.160]  It's years of work, but six months of production and then have no promotion of it, so I really
[15:39.160 --> 15:40.680]  want to roll it out.
[15:40.680 --> 15:42.600]  That's why I wanted to add to it and expand on it.
[15:42.600 --> 15:51.720]  The resetwars will be dropping into the third dimension, coming up at 7 p.m. central on
[15:51.720 --> 15:53.600]  December 13, next Monday.

[16:55.600 --> 16:57.280]  God bless and thanks for your support.
[16:57.280 --> 17:02.120]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[17:02.120 --> 17:04.160]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[17:04.160 --> 17:09.880]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[17:09.880 --> 17:10.880]  But we failed.
[17:10.880 --> 17:12.320]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[17:12.320 --> 17:18.120]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[17:18.120 --> 17:20.480]  deindustrialization great reset.

[19:05.360 --> 19:11.680]  Yeah, first of all let me say I love your products, I am a granny and for all the senior citizens
[19:11.680 --> 19:16.480]  out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots
[19:16.480 --> 19:22.000]  or H-spots as they're lovingly called but since taking your X2 for the last couple of years
[19:22.000 --> 19:29.720]  my skin is just really gorgeous actually, people think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking
[19:29.720 --> 19:33.760]  your other supplements but I thought, you know, well maybe that's what I need to do
[19:33.760 --> 19:38.200]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation but when I started taking it, I mean it doesn't
[19:38.200 --> 19:43.920]  happen immediately but you know over a period of time I started noticing, okay, you know
[19:43.920 --> 19:49.160]  this is the ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know, I don't have to put
[19:49.160 --> 19:54.920]  on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally
[19:54.920 --> 20:01.920]  cleared up my skin.
[20:01.920 --> 20:31.560]  Thank you again for joining us on this December 6 Monday Transmission, I'm your host Alex
[20:31.560 --> 20:37.200]  Jones, very blessed and honored to be here talking to millions of you and I would just
[20:37.200 --> 20:44.160]  encourage all of you to understand how rare and special a transmission like this is with
[20:44.160 --> 20:50.280]  amazing people like you listening and contributing information and spreading the word and all
[20:50.280 --> 20:58.000]  the very informative guests, some of them even prophetic and the calls, all of the really
[20:58.000 --> 21:06.000]  interesting and thought provoking callers, this is really a focal point of human consciousness
[21:06.000 --> 21:12.200]  and our will and it's something they're trying to black out, something the social engineers,
[21:12.200 --> 21:17.240]  the dark wizards, the New World Order are trying to keep from view because we are a
[21:17.240 --> 21:24.960]  burning torch on the hill and a message to others around the country and around the world
[21:24.960 --> 21:31.400]  that there is a resistance and the resistance is strong.
[21:31.400 --> 21:37.000]  So before I hit all this nightmare information, remember it's the same reason I would go get
[21:37.000 --> 21:41.880]  a tooth that had an infection fix.
[21:41.880 --> 21:47.160]  My body would send a signal of pain from a rotten tooth to me so that I would know there
[21:47.160 --> 21:52.920]  was an issue and so that I would protect it and so that I would tend to it so that I would
[21:52.920 --> 21:59.320]  look at it or I would then remove it but in modern times be able to get it fixed at least
[21:59.320 --> 22:05.880]  for a while, nothing is as good as what God gave us up front is it.
[22:05.880 --> 22:08.760]  So when I cover all these horrible things you have to understand the globalists were
[22:08.760 --> 22:11.360]  in deep trouble two years ago.
[22:11.360 --> 22:16.040]  Their project for corporate world government was being resisted by nationalist nation states
[22:16.040 --> 22:25.000]  on every populated continent, every continent but Antarctica.
[22:25.000 --> 22:32.320]  And so they launched COVID-19 and all that it stands for as their big weapon program
[22:32.320 --> 22:42.520]  and as their original plan but they launched it I don't even think early because their
[22:42.520 --> 22:47.800]  own writings had it coming in about 2020 and they even predicted in some of their British
[22:47.800 --> 22:56.280]  military reports, national reports back in 2007 and others that by the year 2020 they
[22:56.280 --> 23:02.960]  thought there would be a global populist movement fighting globalism and that they would then
[23:02.960 --> 23:07.720]  use the fear of viruses to have a UN world response that would then basically take over
[23:07.720 --> 23:13.440]  the nation states and put people on a digital passport system and basically close the door
[23:13.440 --> 23:17.960]  on freedom and humanity forever.
[23:17.960 --> 23:21.520]  And if you want to find an article about that original British report that said a lot of
[23:21.520 --> 23:35.520]  this just type in brain chips and flash mobs, a grim vision of the future.
[23:35.520 --> 23:42.760]  And then it links to the 17 page synopses of the classified report put out by the British
[23:42.760 --> 23:48.680]  and memory serves in 2007 and there it is, revolution, flash mobs and brain chips, a
[23:48.680 --> 23:56.560]  grim vision of the future and they've got it all happening in the year 2020 including
[23:56.560 --> 24:04.400]  the virus and then of course three years later they wrote operation lockstep and the UN officially
[24:04.400 --> 24:17.000]  said the Rockefeller Foundation would be in command with their adjunct being the consortium
[24:17.000 --> 24:34.240]  of foundations set up to carry out eugenics captained by William Gates III who's at least
[24:34.240 --> 24:42.920]  a fourth generation eugenicist, depopulation royalty, family goes back to the 1880s in
[24:42.920 --> 24:54.280]  that when the science of extermination and enslavement was only 30 years old.
[24:54.280 --> 25:02.560]  So that's where we are my friends, as a civilization and as a society.
[25:02.560 --> 25:09.680]  And so there was a big awakening taking place and they told us what they would do to us
[25:09.680 --> 25:19.640]  and they did it and it's a legitimate, it's criminal, it is a bigger, more vicious plan
[25:19.640 --> 25:24.840]  than anything Hitler ever dreamed of and it's already killed millions of people and it tends
[25:24.840 --> 25:27.220]  to kill billions.
[25:27.220 --> 25:35.320]  Is the designed, organized, collapse of civilization as a form of warfare against the species
[25:35.320 --> 25:41.320]  itself under the Carnegie endowment directive from the 1920s to end all war.
[25:41.320 --> 25:52.520]  The memorandum 7277 of the State Department memorandum 200 as well that is a stated goal
[25:52.520 --> 25:58.720]  when they were commissioned to end all war after a six-year commission of the Carnegie
[25:58.720 --> 26:05.400]  endowment, the decision was made to end humanity as we know it, industrialize the development
[26:05.400 --> 26:11.880]  of humanoids, license the birth of said humanoids and have a very tiny less than one-tenth
[26:11.880 --> 26:17.440]  of one percent original human population left who would probably then decide to transcend,
[26:17.440 --> 26:24.040]  they projected with technology developments into a new species.
[26:24.040 --> 26:31.280]  Just from the 20s and some of their top futurists were H.G. Wells, that's why Hitler wanted
[26:31.280 --> 26:39.240]  H.G. Wells killed, not because H.G. Wells, first thing Hitler wanted when he got into
[26:39.240 --> 26:45.040]  power in 1933 was to kill H.G. Wells and if you ask yourselves why I thought I'd go research
[26:45.040 --> 26:51.360]  that when I learned that 30-something years ago, H.G. Wells even talked about it when
[26:51.360 --> 26:58.240]  he was on San Antonio radio station, I've heard the interview on KTSA for an archive
[26:58.240 --> 27:05.880]  of it and that was because they had his writings both public and private and they had both
[27:05.880 --> 27:13.480]  fiction and non-fiction and the competing plan they had was a liberal, right system
[27:13.480 --> 27:17.440]  of depopulation and Hitler didn't like that plan.
[27:17.440 --> 27:22.760]  He wanted only Aryans to be able to end up living, he wanted to kill even most of the
[27:22.760 --> 27:29.320]  white people and that's not what H.G. Wells commissioned by Cecil Rhodes was setting up.
[27:29.320 --> 27:34.280]  So you have to understand when you tune into my show, we just cut through all the BS and
[27:34.280 --> 27:46.400]  we just go right to who's actually running things and we cut to what they're doing and
[27:46.400 --> 27:47.960]  they're playing for you and your family.
[27:47.960 --> 27:55.840]  Oh, Trump called Millie an effing idiot, oh my gosh how cool, oh man he's like a, Trump's
[27:55.840 --> 28:02.200]  like a rock star, he's so real, he's so funny and Millie is an effing scumbag, an anti-American
[28:02.200 --> 28:12.480]  piece of filth, a big fat ugly fake punk but that is only the tip of the iceberg.
[28:12.480 --> 28:16.960]  You know Trump who the big effing idiots are, people that still go along with these so-called
[28:16.960 --> 28:20.200]  vaccines when they know they don't work and they're hurting people but because it might
[28:20.200 --> 28:23.800]  make them look bad they won't come out against it and say that they were kind and they were
[28:23.800 --> 28:29.640]  set up and then it was wrong because Trump knows that if he does that the system will
[28:29.640 --> 28:30.640]  kill him.
[28:30.640 --> 28:37.000]  So I guess Trump doesn't mind having millions of children named dead and dying on his name
[28:37.000 --> 28:38.720]  but I won't carry that around with me.
[28:38.720 --> 28:43.400]  So if I got children on the one hand and Trump on the other I'm going to throw him politically
[28:43.400 --> 28:47.480]  overboard and I'll wipe my ass with Donald Trump before I get the blood of children
[28:47.480 --> 28:51.000]  on my hands and they're hurting children all over this country and all over the world right
[28:51.000 --> 28:56.560]  now with these damn shots, oh have you heard the Democrats are set to announce masks forever?
[28:56.560 --> 28:58.560]  Stay with us.
[28:58.560 --> 29:06.560]  Hey everybody, I have a question to ask you, why would you spend your money this Christmas
[29:06.560 --> 29:12.480]  season to buy gifts for friends and family and loved ones with the establishment, with
[29:12.480 --> 29:19.240]  the big corporations that are dedicated to waging war on all of our freedoms and suppressing
[29:19.240 --> 29:22.120]  us and forcing medical tyranny on us?
[29:22.120 --> 29:26.720]  I've never backed down to tyranny and we've had incredible successes fighting them thanks
[29:26.720 --> 29:33.320]  to your support but now as 2021 comes to a close I want to encourage you now more than
[29:33.320 --> 29:41.560]  ever to support the truth and you do that at InfoWarStore.com, store-wide free shipping,

[29:51.720 --> 30:00.120]  that also fund the Info War, the only way you fail is not taking action.
[30:00.120 --> 30:03.640]  Let's go ahead and take another call, let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee, welcome.
[30:03.640 --> 30:04.640]  Hello, Alex.
[30:04.640 --> 30:05.640]  Yes, Malcolm.
[30:05.640 --> 30:08.920]  All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the
[30:08.920 --> 30:09.920]  line.
[30:09.920 --> 30:14.400]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer, SuperMail
[30:14.400 --> 30:19.840]  Vitality and Brain Force Plus, mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[30:19.840 --> 30:24.840]  SuperMail Vitality really, really works, it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[30:24.840 --> 30:30.960]  that have never been heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions
[30:30.960 --> 30:33.160]  that also work quite well but just aren't as strong.
[30:33.160 --> 30:37.600]  This is like a very fine wine, in fact, each batch is different.
[30:37.600 --> 30:40.680]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay, people are like, why are you selling
[30:40.680 --> 30:43.120]  something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[30:43.120 --> 30:45.640]  That's just how it is, it's how it works.
[30:45.640 --> 30:50.320]  So it's always good, it's just sometimes it's like super strong, but yeah, if you want the
[30:50.320 --> 30:59.640]  Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[30:59.640 --> 31:05.600]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games, I like going to concerts, I
[31:05.600 --> 31:08.240]  like going to play golf, I like going out to dinner.
[31:08.240 --> 31:14.040]  I like the metropolitan life, I like everything that comes with this, but see, I have the
[31:14.040 --> 31:19.520]  survival instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat run cities, get the hell out
[31:19.520 --> 31:24.280]  of major metropolitan areas, because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing
[31:24.280 --> 31:25.280]  down.
[31:25.280 --> 31:28.320]  Is it time to just move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in
[31:28.320 --> 31:31.840]  the woods, just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the
[31:31.840 --> 31:32.840]  land?
[31:32.840 --> 31:33.840]  That's the survival instinct.
[31:33.840 --> 31:37.520]  But see, the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says, no,
[31:37.520 --> 31:39.600]  no, no, no, no, stay in the city.
[31:39.600 --> 31:43.000]  The survival instinct says, get the hell out of anywhere they've ever noticed that you
[31:43.000 --> 31:44.800]  need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[31:44.800 --> 31:50.280]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing
[31:50.280 --> 31:51.280]  as well.
[31:51.280 --> 31:55.880]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies.
[31:55.880 --> 31:58.080]  And so we have the best ones at InfowarsStore.com.
[31:58.080 --> 32:03.640]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, keep us on air.

[32:25.640 --> 32:30.400]  And you know, I'm telling you, the vitamin D gummies, this is a great thing for your
[32:30.400 --> 32:31.400]  kids.
[32:31.400 --> 32:32.400]  They're going to love it.
[32:32.400 --> 32:33.400]  They're going to love the taste of the gummies.
[32:33.400 --> 32:34.400]  It's healthy.
[32:34.400 --> 32:36.000]  So that's just a great thing for kids.
[32:36.000 --> 32:37.680]  I mean, we could just do marketing campaigns.
[32:37.680 --> 32:40.240]  I think, I think for kids, that'd be great.
[32:40.240 --> 32:41.240]  Calcium good for them.
[32:41.240 --> 32:45.680]  The vitamin D. So that's at infowarsstore.com.
[32:45.680 --> 32:48.280]  And again, it's your support there that keeps us on the air.

[32:56.520 --> 32:58.080]  Your support there keeps us on the air.
[32:58.080 --> 33:01.360]  We cannot thank you enough.
[33:01.360 --> 33:12.800]  Feeding a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:12.800 --> 33:17.240]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[33:17.240 --> 33:32.120]  Nothing to you lie, from the front lines of the info war.
[33:32.120 --> 33:38.240]  See, my job is not to just sit here and fight the globalists, but when we're about to really
[33:38.240 --> 33:39.800]  beat them back off.
[33:39.800 --> 33:42.000]  Now, I'm here to defeat them.
[33:42.000 --> 33:43.000]  I'm here to crush them.
[33:43.000 --> 33:46.160]  I'm here to get them off the backs of our children and the innocent people everywhere
[33:46.160 --> 33:49.200]  that they're feeding on their killing.
[33:49.200 --> 33:54.640]  And so Trump was on Fox and Friends again this morning.
[33:54.640 --> 33:58.960]  And there he was talking about how great the vaccine is, what a wonderful job he did.
[33:58.960 --> 34:05.320]  And people were taking it under him, but now they don't trust Biden.
[34:05.320 --> 34:11.320]  And so it's our job to put heat on Trump so that he understands, and I have all the statistics
[34:11.320 --> 34:16.800]  and numbers right here that you're twice as likely to get sick, be hospitalized or die.
[34:16.800 --> 34:22.480]  All of those are double in numbers coming out of the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Germany,
[34:22.480 --> 34:23.480]  you name it.
[34:23.480 --> 34:25.280]  I showed those numbers again last night.
[34:25.280 --> 34:28.920]  Everybody knows about these.
[34:28.920 --> 34:36.240]  And so I'm not blaming Trump back in the time because he thought it was a traditional vaccine
[34:36.240 --> 34:38.040]  he didn't understand.
[34:38.040 --> 34:40.920]  But now we've seen.
[34:40.920 --> 34:44.160]  Now we know it's causing serious illnesses.
[34:44.160 --> 34:46.000]  Now they're coming after newborn children.
[34:46.000 --> 34:51.360]  In fact, he says starting in one month, he says starting in January of 2022, we're going
[34:51.360 --> 34:58.040]  to get authorization, all very well researched and backed up, total lies, all independent,
[34:58.040 --> 35:06.040]  all lies, of newborns.
[35:06.040 --> 35:10.280]  And can you imagine watching Trump every time he's on a show, come at the great job he did
[35:10.280 --> 35:13.560]  with these damn shots?
[35:13.560 --> 35:15.600]  I like Trump getting us out of the WHO.
[35:15.600 --> 35:16.880]  I like Trump exposing China.
[35:16.880 --> 35:18.360]  I like Trump trying to secure borders.
[35:18.360 --> 35:19.720]  I like Trump trying to get our jobs back.
[35:19.720 --> 35:22.840]  I like Trump standing up against the fentanyl flowing in.
[35:22.840 --> 35:26.360]  I like President Trump.
[35:26.360 --> 35:33.160]  The guy called up my wife on her honeymoon to tell her how great I am.
[35:33.160 --> 35:38.240]  He's a legitimately very nice guy behind the scenes, not the tough guy.
[35:38.240 --> 35:49.000]  You hear about in all these different shows he's done like The Apprentice.
[35:49.000 --> 35:55.240]  But we can sit here and beat our heads up against the wall from now until the end of
[35:55.240 --> 36:02.240]  time trying to stop globalists and new older operatives from their evil.
[36:02.240 --> 36:03.240]  They love what they're doing.
[36:03.240 --> 36:04.680]  They're going to go forward and do it.
[36:04.680 --> 36:12.680]  But if we can get some of the good U.S. senators and good governors and people like Trump especially
[36:12.680 --> 36:18.400]  to say, wow, I didn't know that they had information.
[36:18.400 --> 36:20.560]  This would cause blood clots and they suppressed it.
[36:20.560 --> 36:21.560]  I didn't know.
[36:21.560 --> 36:25.040]  I mean, he should at least come out and say, oh, children don't even really get sick with
[36:25.040 --> 36:26.040]  COVID.
[36:26.040 --> 36:27.040]  Why are you giving it to them?
[36:27.040 --> 36:28.040]  Stop.
[36:28.040 --> 36:29.040]  Don't give it to children.
[36:29.040 --> 36:38.080]  I've got articles where major medical watchdog groups that are very respected are coming
[36:38.080 --> 36:43.240]  out saying there's no reason to give people under the age of 30 this stuff.
[36:43.240 --> 36:46.880]  Nobody dies from COVID unless they already have like three or four comorbidities and
[36:46.880 --> 36:47.880]  already about to die.
[36:47.880 --> 36:50.080]  Then a cold wind blows by.
[36:50.080 --> 36:51.080]  They die.
[36:51.080 --> 36:52.080]  They're saying, stop it.
[36:52.080 --> 36:53.080]  What are you doing?
[36:53.080 --> 36:55.560]  And it does erase your immune system.
[36:55.560 --> 36:57.200]  This was done by design.
[36:57.200 --> 37:02.480]  Trump got set up, hey, sir, we can reopen quicker if you just take these controls off.
[37:02.480 --> 37:04.840]  Okay, Fauci, I'll do it.
[37:04.840 --> 37:05.840]  He called Senator Paul.
[37:05.840 --> 37:07.840]  Doctor, you think this is a good idea?
[37:07.840 --> 37:08.840]  Yeah.
[37:08.840 --> 37:12.640]  Get it through.
[37:12.640 --> 37:25.640]  Operation warp speed, if you remember, happened and began 20 months ago, 21 months ago.
[37:25.640 --> 37:33.040]  And so I consider and talk about all this news and all this information all day long.
[37:33.040 --> 37:37.880]  But if we don't get Trump and if we don't get Senator Paul and we don't get them to
[37:37.880 --> 37:51.120]  speak out, even the opposition leaders aren't on the field taking action against this.
[37:51.120 --> 37:57.240]  So it's now time to say, hey, Fauci lied about everything.
[37:57.240 --> 38:01.880]  Fauci lied on every front.
[38:01.880 --> 38:03.600]  Fauci's a fraud.
[38:03.600 --> 38:05.240]  Fauci created the virus.
[38:05.240 --> 38:06.480]  Fauci was involved in getting a function.
[38:06.480 --> 38:07.480]  Instead, he wasn't.
[38:07.480 --> 38:11.640]  Fauci's invested in the vaccines and Trump can come out and say they lied to me to get
[38:11.640 --> 38:12.640]  this through.
[38:12.640 --> 38:15.640]  And we did an investigation into what they did.
[38:15.640 --> 38:19.440]  Instead, he is getting deeper and deeper and deeper into this.
[38:19.440 --> 38:24.880]  And as more and more of it comes out, it's going to destroy Trump with his constituency.
[38:24.880 --> 38:26.640]  And it should.
[38:26.640 --> 38:33.080]  Because if he doesn't step up and say no when he's got a chance to and lets them come after
[38:33.080 --> 38:40.920]  the children, which is now happening in live time, then Trump is unsalvageable.
[38:40.920 --> 38:42.600]  And I'm really trying to salvage Trump here.
[38:42.600 --> 38:46.640]  I'm really trying to help President Trump here.
[38:46.640 --> 38:50.080]  But they lied to him.
[38:50.080 --> 38:51.080]  And now we know.
[38:51.080 --> 38:56.840]  I mean, now they say, oh, Israel's now authorizing the fourth shot and saying a fifth shot will
[38:56.840 --> 38:57.840]  be needed.
[38:57.840 --> 39:01.480]  And now the head of Pfizer says you're going to need multiple shots a year forever.
[39:01.480 --> 39:03.000]  And then COVID will be here forever.
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.480]  And then masks are forever.
[39:05.480 --> 39:10.440]  All this tyranny forever and ever and ever.
[39:10.440 --> 39:14.760]  And instead of Trump turning on Fauci and saying I was given bad advice by these people,
[39:14.760 --> 39:18.160]  they're criminals.
[39:18.160 --> 39:22.040]  He sits there because they set him up and now he is tied to them.
[39:22.040 --> 39:23.040]  He believes forever.
[39:23.040 --> 39:24.760]  And that's how corruption works.
[39:24.760 --> 39:29.060]  No, Trump's got to come clean and explain that he didn't know.
[39:29.060 --> 39:34.880]  But every passing day that goes by, as the evidence comes out and mounts, we know Trump
[39:34.880 --> 39:38.680]  knows about this and we know he's getting heat about this.
[39:38.680 --> 39:42.520]  I've talked to a lot of people that talked to him personally that have told him this.
[39:42.520 --> 39:45.760]  And he changes the subject.
[39:45.760 --> 39:52.120]  The injection doesn't work.
[39:52.120 --> 39:54.900]  It erases your immune system, it gives you heart problems.
[39:54.900 --> 39:56.760]  It massively gives you cancer.
[39:56.760 --> 40:04.480]  It destroys your DNA double strand repair system.
[40:04.480 --> 40:07.320]  And it's a crime against humanity, what's going on.
[40:07.320 --> 40:14.760]  And it is a Nuremberg code violation in spades.
[40:14.760 --> 40:18.640]  When we come back, I've got all the horrible police state news unfolding, but this image
[40:18.640 --> 40:22.160]  of this meme going around says it all.
[40:22.160 --> 40:28.560]  It's two women having tea and one's not wearing a mask and the other is wearing a mask.
[40:28.560 --> 40:30.120]  It's 1950 style.
[40:30.120 --> 40:34.760]  She says, I comply because I want it to end.
[40:34.760 --> 40:41.040]  It's because you comply that it will never end, the other woman responds back.
[40:41.040 --> 40:44.240]  This isn't going to end until people start telling employers they're not going to do
[40:44.240 --> 40:45.240]  it.
[40:45.240 --> 40:46.960]  I mean, the Muslims told our women they had to wear masks.
[40:46.960 --> 40:47.960]  We go to war with them.
[40:47.960 --> 40:52.880]  But oh, now Fauci says, so we do it.
[40:52.880 --> 40:55.400]  There's an article on infowars.com about this.
[40:55.400 --> 41:05.280]  Workers now demand your ban from talking while eating, don't even open your filthy mouth.
[41:05.280 --> 41:06.920]  They want to be your mommy.
[41:06.920 --> 41:09.440]  They want to be your daddy.
[41:09.440 --> 41:14.120]  Health Watchdog urges limits on jabbing children against COVID.
[41:14.120 --> 41:17.960]  Babies hospitalized that they're getting COVID-19 vaccine.
[41:17.960 --> 41:21.240]  Oregon moves to make indoor mask mandate permanent.
[41:21.240 --> 41:25.560]  But wait, it gets more reliant when we come back.
[41:25.560 --> 41:27.200]  That's just some of what's coming up separately.
[41:27.200 --> 41:35.920]  Today is the last day to get the Cyber Monday sales of store-wide free shipping, double
[41:35.920 --> 41:46.240]  Patriot points, 40% off on vitamin mineral fusion, 40% off on DNA Force Plus, 50% off
[41:46.240 --> 41:48.800]  on Prostaguard and a bunch of other specials.
[41:48.800 --> 41:53.840]  We'll still have some specials going into Christmas, like we'll still have all apparel
[41:53.840 --> 41:54.840]  at cost.
[41:54.840 --> 41:57.960]  So if a shirt costs us 14 bucks, it's 14 bucks.
[41:57.960 --> 42:00.480]  If a shirt costs us $5 a medic, it's $5.
[42:00.480 --> 42:06.240]  If it costs us $9.95, just whatever it costs us, with the cost of the shirt, the warehousing,
[42:06.240 --> 42:11.040]  a little equation is done, all apparel is at cost.
[42:11.040 --> 42:17.440]  It gets great clothes, spreads the word, gets infowars out there, get your Christmas shopping
[42:17.440 --> 42:20.680]  done, keep us on air.
[42:20.680 --> 42:23.400]  That sales is going to extend out for at least a couple of days, but we're starting to get
[42:23.400 --> 42:24.600]  low on a lot of the shirts.
[42:24.600 --> 42:29.040]  But almost everything ends today.
[42:29.040 --> 42:39.080]  Store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points are 888-253-3139, I love the new Made
[42:39.080 --> 42:46.160]  in 1776 shirt, it's got the big ring of stars around it and the white flag on it.
[42:46.160 --> 42:52.720]  That's one of my favorite designs out there and that's an incredible deal, long-sleeved
[42:52.720 --> 42:57.640]  shirt Made in 1776.
[42:57.640 --> 42:58.640]  Very inexpensive.
[42:58.640 --> 42:59.640]  Let's go ahead.
[42:59.640 --> 43:05.240]  Our 2021 Cyber Week specials end on Monday, December 6th.
[43:05.240 --> 43:09.800]  That means if you want store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points, and up to 50% off on
[43:09.800 --> 43:13.720]  our best-selling products like Prostagard, you have to take advantage of it right now.

[43:23.000 --> 43:25.520]  DNA Force Plus, 40% off.
[43:25.520 --> 43:29.320]  The list goes on on Prostagard with Saupam Meadow, it's not just good for your prostate,
[43:29.320 --> 43:35.600]  good for all your glands, it's 50% off again with free shipping and some items are even
[43:35.600 --> 43:37.640]  above 50% off.
[43:37.640 --> 43:41.680]  Go to infowarsstore.com, get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get a water filtration,
[43:41.680 --> 43:42.680]  get an air filtration.
[43:42.680 --> 43:46.960]  Whatever you do, do your shopping there with Patriots that are fighting for all of our
[43:46.960 --> 43:47.960]  collective liberties together.
[43:47.960 --> 43:51.560]  If you shop at the big box stores, you deserve to be a slave.
[43:51.560 --> 43:54.960]  If you shop at InfoWars, you're part of the team fighting for liberty.
[43:54.960 --> 43:58.280]  God bless and thanks for your support.
[43:58.280 --> 44:03.680]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's
[44:03.680 --> 44:07.680]  happening in the atmosphere, but if you look at all the different studies and reports about
[44:07.680 --> 44:12.960]  NASA and other governments and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening
[44:12.960 --> 44:13.960]  with the climate.
[44:13.960 --> 44:18.520]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[44:18.520 --> 44:23.840]  So yes, climate change is totally real, but notice first they called it global freezing
[44:23.840 --> 44:27.160]  back in the 70s and 80s and then it's going to be global warming and when that didn't
[44:27.160 --> 44:28.560]  really happen the way they wanted to.
[44:28.560 --> 44:33.680]  Okay, now it's just climate change, but did you know that manmade climate change is a
[44:33.680 --> 44:39.360]  real thing when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates
[44:39.360 --> 44:40.360]  and the UN?
[44:40.360 --> 44:41.360]  They have.
[44:41.360 --> 44:45.680]  Weather control treaties from 1979 and Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for
[44:45.680 --> 44:46.680]  a very long time.
[44:46.680 --> 44:51.200]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different
[44:51.200 --> 44:53.920]  particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[44:53.920 --> 44:57.400]  So yes, manmade climate change is real.
[44:57.400 --> 45:00.760]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[45:00.760 --> 45:05.120]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[45:05.120 --> 45:09.800]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[45:09.800 --> 45:14.320]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[45:14.320 --> 45:19.120]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[45:19.120 --> 45:24.840]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide
[45:24.840 --> 45:30.640]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[45:30.640 --> 45:37.520]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[45:37.520 --> 45:42.120]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[45:42.120 --> 45:47.880]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[45:47.880 --> 45:50.720]  facts that pertain to reality.
[45:50.720 --> 45:56.720]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[45:56.720 --> 46:03.520]  In late August, Infowars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[46:03.520 --> 46:08.960]  that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause
[46:08.960 --> 46:13.000]  an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[46:13.000 --> 46:16.320]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to
[46:16.320 --> 46:17.320]  have.
[46:17.320 --> 46:20.160]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water
[46:20.160 --> 46:24.040]  filtration, self-defense and a relationship with God.
[46:24.040 --> 46:27.400]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in.
[46:27.400 --> 46:30.840]  Now we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[46:30.840 --> 46:31.840]  It's high quality.
[46:31.840 --> 46:36.560]  It's very, very low cost at InfowarsStore.com because in the future you're going to see
[46:36.560 --> 46:40.880]  more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are
[46:40.880 --> 46:42.200]  already taking place.
[46:42.200 --> 46:48.480]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the Infowar at InfowarsStore.com.
[46:48.480 --> 46:53.120]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[46:53.120 --> 47:00.120]  You'll get prepared now at InfowarsStore.com.
[47:00.120 --> 47:02.760]  Um.
[47:02.760 --> 47:16.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:16.200 --> 47:26.400]  The worst thing about the first 15 days to flatten the curve is the first two years.
[47:26.400 --> 47:28.240]  That's right.
[47:28.240 --> 47:35.040]  The worst thing about 15 days to flatten the curve is the first two years.
[47:35.040 --> 47:38.280]  That's the worst part about the 15 days.
[47:38.280 --> 47:39.600]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[47:39.600 --> 47:44.000]  You know what's really incredible, whether you're in Canada or the UK or Germany or the
[47:44.000 --> 47:48.840]  US or Australia, it doesn't matter where you are, I have all the clips here today.
[47:48.840 --> 47:50.560]  I wasn't even looking for them.
[47:50.560 --> 47:52.040]  They're all just everywhere.
[47:52.040 --> 47:54.480]  Oh, the vaccines are permanent.
[47:54.480 --> 47:56.400]  You're going to take them a couple of times a year forever.
[47:56.400 --> 47:57.400]  Yeah.
[47:57.400 --> 47:58.400]  We own your body.
[47:58.400 --> 47:59.920]  Oh, and you're going to wear your mask forever.
[47:59.920 --> 48:03.880]  And by the way, we're still going to tell you when you can and can't leave your house.
[48:03.880 --> 48:09.160]  It's part of the new system to cut carbon.
[48:09.160 --> 48:13.520]  And people are tuning in going, yeah, I heard you say this early last year, almost two years
[48:13.520 --> 48:14.520]  ago.
[48:14.520 --> 48:15.520]  How'd you know?
[48:15.520 --> 48:20.480]  Because it's a damn plan.
[48:20.480 --> 48:24.160]  And I've gotten Joe Rogan to wake up to that and I've helped get Tucker Carlson awake.
[48:24.160 --> 48:26.160]  I'm not bragging, but that's some of my best work.
[48:26.160 --> 48:30.880]  And I've got a lot of you to wake up and I know you've woken a lot of folks up.
[48:30.880 --> 48:32.880]  But this is not that hard.
[48:32.880 --> 48:39.800]  This is a designed world government criminal takeover.
[48:39.800 --> 48:53.400]  So here is Jackalinda Arden, the bizarre, skexie, Seahag Gremlin creature, who's a total Hillary
[48:53.400 --> 48:57.760]  Clinton acolyte, loves communist China, laughing and giggling.
[48:57.760 --> 49:06.800]  She said last week, remember, hey, we have created two classes and those of you that
[49:06.800 --> 49:10.120]  don't take whatever shots we want are going to be locked up forever.
[49:10.120 --> 49:13.080]  People said, so this is a two-class system where we discriminate against the unvaxxed.
[49:13.080 --> 49:16.240]  She goes, yep, that's what it is.
[49:16.240 --> 49:30.280]  The arrogance, the bravada, the hubris, the hutzpah, the criminology.
[49:30.280 --> 49:35.240]  And now here she is, here she is saying, it's forever.
[49:35.240 --> 49:36.240]  It's forever.
[49:36.240 --> 49:38.440]  They all follow the global program.
[49:38.440 --> 49:43.280]  And now it's the time to rub our noses in and say, it's forever.
[49:43.280 --> 49:48.160]  Like a Disney song, forever and ever and ever, we're going to beat you in the head.
[49:48.160 --> 49:49.680]  We're going to take you to camps.
[49:49.680 --> 49:54.600]  We're going to quarantine you forever and ever and ever.
[49:54.600 --> 49:57.360]  Always the plan, end of freedom.
[49:57.360 --> 50:02.280]  And those of us in places like Texas or Florida that have leaders that aren't total globalists
[50:02.280 --> 50:07.160]  are like, well, thank God we don't live in Germany or thank God we don't live in.
[50:07.160 --> 50:08.680]  It's all coming here.
[50:08.680 --> 50:11.600]  It's all run by the same people.
[50:11.600 --> 50:14.840]  The collapse of the blue cities and blue states will bring us down as well.
[50:14.840 --> 50:20.400]  We have to stop these people, but we can't even get Senator Paul, who knows all this,
[50:20.400 --> 50:22.400]  to talk about how it's the new world we want to take over.
[50:22.400 --> 50:25.960]  Oh, because the New York Times might criticize him.
[50:25.960 --> 50:30.160]  Can we get maybe Dr. Paul to do it?
[50:30.160 --> 50:35.680]  Here's the deal, I'm trying to get people to move in a united front against the multinational
[50:35.680 --> 50:39.600]  takeover runner that's permanent.
[50:39.600 --> 50:42.760]  And by the way, the people I criticize the most are the most effective, best people we've
[50:42.760 --> 50:43.760]  got.
[50:43.760 --> 50:45.320]  We need them to help save us all.
[50:45.320 --> 50:51.080]  Yes, I need Donald Trump to come across all the way and be the man he was born to be and
[50:51.080 --> 50:53.960]  reverse this nightmare he helped put in place via fraud.
[50:53.960 --> 50:57.240]  He didn't know, but the more he goes along with it, he's the blame.
[50:57.240 --> 50:58.240]  Same thing with Rand Paul.
[50:58.240 --> 51:02.760]  He knows that it's not just that learned immunities way better than what you get from this vaccine.
[51:02.760 --> 51:06.840]  This vaccine turns off your white blood cells and in six months you have less immunity than
[51:06.840 --> 51:13.560]  you had before the shot.
[51:13.560 --> 51:16.560]  It gives you the damn COVID.
[51:16.560 --> 51:21.360]  So admit you got conned, Rand Paul, in fact, I'm even more pissed at him than I am at Trump.
[51:21.360 --> 51:23.360]  Seriously, think about it.
[51:23.360 --> 51:25.560]  He knows.
[51:25.560 --> 51:27.160]  I know they shot at you.
[51:27.160 --> 51:28.200]  I know they broke your ribs.
[51:28.200 --> 51:31.080]  I know they've done all that stuff and I know they're threatening.
[51:31.080 --> 51:35.360]  But what's the point of fighting these people and not going all the way?
[51:35.360 --> 51:36.680]  You know Fauci's a murderer.
[51:36.680 --> 51:38.080]  You know he needs to go to prison for five years.
[51:38.080 --> 51:42.880]  I salute you for that, Senator Paul, but I need you to go all the way for my children
[51:42.880 --> 51:43.880]  and yours.
[51:43.880 --> 51:47.840]  In fact, I order you to do it in the name of the American people.
[51:47.840 --> 51:50.000]  I order you to save yourself and save us.
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.480]  I order you to be the hero you were born to be.
[51:52.480 --> 51:56.600]  If my order is meeting anything, if the American people's order is meeting, everybody should
[51:56.600 --> 52:00.280]  call his office and say, we order you to stop this.
[52:00.280 --> 52:01.960]  We order you to be a warrior.
[52:01.960 --> 52:04.680]  We order you to get out on the field as our champion.
[52:04.680 --> 52:08.240]  We order you to do it.
[52:08.240 --> 52:10.880]  I'll tell you, folks, God's ordering me to take action.
[52:10.880 --> 52:13.520]  I know God's setting it on your heart to not go along with this.
[52:13.520 --> 52:17.920]  I will not aid to bed maiming and killing all these children.
[52:17.920 --> 52:19.840]  And I'm under attack too by the very same people.
[52:19.840 --> 52:24.760]  I know that your instincts go counter to this, Senator Paul, but you got to do it now.
[52:24.760 --> 52:25.760]  I'm sorry.
[52:25.760 --> 52:27.400]  Go ahead and see the smiling demon.
[52:27.400 --> 52:31.080]  If you're a radio listener, you're lucky you don't have to look at this witch.
[52:31.080 --> 52:33.200]  Same one that said, don't look at the sunset.
[52:33.200 --> 52:34.400]  Same one said, don't talk to your neighbors.
[52:34.400 --> 52:37.280]  It's a freaking cult leader.
[52:37.280 --> 52:39.880]  The governor of New York, the appointed governor said, go out.
[52:39.880 --> 52:40.880]  I'm Jesus.
[52:40.880 --> 52:41.880]  You're my disciples.
[52:41.880 --> 52:42.880]  Go out the new religion.
[52:42.880 --> 52:49.240]  I mean, it's a cult of sickos that are run by pedophiles.
[52:49.240 --> 52:51.640]  I don't know if the New York governor is a pedophile.
[52:51.640 --> 52:54.480]  I don't know if the New Zealand prime minister is a pedophile, but if I was going to cast
[52:54.480 --> 53:00.320]  women to run a cult in a science fiction movie that like kills kids or does medical experiments
[53:00.320 --> 53:01.320]  on them, it'd be them.
[53:01.320 --> 53:02.320]  And guess what?
[53:02.320 --> 53:04.880]  They're doing medical experiments on our children coming after newborns now.
[53:04.880 --> 53:06.440]  So they are what they look like.
[53:06.440 --> 53:15.000]  They are just the witch vampire zombie trash.
[53:15.000 --> 53:21.840]  So here is the New Zealand globalist minion throwing it in our face.
[53:21.840 --> 53:29.000]  There's been a huge focus on making sure that we are reaching everyone, wherever they
[53:29.000 --> 53:33.080]  are in the country, and ensuring that we're overcoming those barriers.
[53:33.080 --> 53:37.640]  But in my mind, so long as there's people who are eligible who haven't been vaccinated,
[53:37.640 --> 53:38.640]  we've got work to do.
[53:38.640 --> 53:43.920]  I don't think I'll ever be satisfied so long as there's someone who is eligible and hasn't
[53:43.920 --> 53:44.920]  been.
[53:44.920 --> 53:45.920]  And that's why I've said this.
[53:45.920 --> 53:49.000]  There's not going to be an endpoint to this vaccination program.
[53:49.000 --> 53:54.560]  Once we've obviously, we're rolling out boosters now, so we've got another wave of people that
[53:54.560 --> 53:56.720]  we need to make sure that we're protecting again.
[53:56.720 --> 54:01.360]  So those who were vaccinated six months ago really need them to come back, or we need
[54:01.360 --> 54:02.360]  to go to them.
[54:02.360 --> 54:08.640]  When you see those countries that are experiencing those fourth waves, you can see that in many
[54:08.640 --> 54:13.680]  cases they either haven't started a booster campaign or they're only just starting, and
[54:13.680 --> 54:17.480]  it does seem to be the thing that's making a difference for those countries that are
[54:17.480 --> 54:19.840]  experiencing it at that time.
[54:19.840 --> 54:24.160]  Oh, Israel's now getting ready for its fifth shot.
[54:24.160 --> 54:29.480]  They have the worst cases in the world, and then Germany is rolling out its third shot.
[54:29.480 --> 54:32.760]  You see, what do the unvaccinated and the vax all have in common?
[54:32.760 --> 54:34.360]  We're never fully vaccinated.
[54:34.360 --> 54:41.240]  She goes, oh, we're going to protect you every six months because it erases your immune system.
[54:41.240 --> 54:44.760]  And then each time you take it, it erases it even more.
[54:44.760 --> 54:48.000]  And they know full damn well what they're doing, where you won't be able to live without
[54:48.000 --> 54:52.800]  these shots now, but they also kill you.
[54:52.800 --> 54:55.360]  We got Gary Franchi coming in here, and I'm going to play these other clips.
[54:55.360 --> 55:00.400]  But member of parliament, Christina Anderson, sends a message to the world.
[55:00.400 --> 55:02.680]  So here's the opposite of the evil you just heard.
[55:02.680 --> 55:07.840]  Here's an angel, a German member of the EU parliament, issuing an emergency SOS.
[55:07.840 --> 55:12.880]  So this is what a real human looks like versus that stick figure scarecrow monster.
[55:12.880 --> 55:18.400]  This message goes out to the people in Australia.
[55:18.400 --> 55:19.920]  My name is Christina Anderson.
[55:19.920 --> 55:25.160]  I'm a member of European Parliament, and I'm answering your SOS call.
[55:25.160 --> 55:31.000]  I will do whatever I can to make it known to the world that your once free and liberal
[55:31.000 --> 55:38.200]  democracy has been transformed into a totalitarian regime, which tramples on human rights, civil
[55:38.200 --> 55:41.480]  liberties, and the role of law.
[55:41.480 --> 55:47.360]  I'm imploring all of you around the world who still think your governments are looking
[55:47.360 --> 55:49.960]  out for your best interest.
[55:49.960 --> 55:57.960]  At no point in history have the people forcing others into compliance been the good guys.
[55:57.960 --> 56:03.920]  The welfare of humanity has always been the alibi of tyrants.
[56:03.920 --> 56:09.720]  Do you not realize that this vaccine does not protect you from COVID?
[56:09.720 --> 56:14.440]  It does, however, protect you from governmental oppression.
[56:14.440 --> 56:16.560]  For now, that is.
[56:16.560 --> 56:23.240]  But don't think for even a second that this is not going to change tomorrow.
[56:23.240 --> 56:29.240]  I'm a German, and we once asked our grandparents how they could have just stood by in silence
[56:29.240 --> 56:35.000]  allowing a horrific totalitarian regime to come about.
[56:35.000 --> 56:40.280]  Everyone could have known all they had to do was open their eyes and take a look.
[56:40.280 --> 56:43.600]  The vast majority chose not to.
[56:43.600 --> 56:48.960]  So what will you tell your grandchildren?
[56:48.960 --> 56:51.440]  Will you tell them you didn't know?
[56:51.440 --> 56:56.120]  Will you tell them you were just following orders?
[56:56.120 --> 57:01.920]  You need to understand it isn't about breaking the fourth wave.
[57:01.920 --> 57:06.880]  It is all about breaking people.
[57:06.880 --> 57:10.800]  Australia does not need a no COVID strategy.
[57:10.800 --> 57:15.520]  What Australia needs is a no oppression strategy.
[57:15.520 --> 57:20.360]  So I stand in support with your fight for freedom and democracy.
[57:20.360 --> 57:27.000]  We need to stop our governments from transforming our free and democratic societies into totalitarian
[57:27.000 --> 57:28.680]  regimes.
[57:28.680 --> 57:30.880]  We need to do it now.
[57:30.880 --> 57:33.440]  We need to stand up now.
[57:33.440 --> 57:38.280]  We need to make that one when the president of the EU commission over the commission is
[57:38.280 --> 57:39.280]  unelected.
[57:39.280 --> 57:42.920]  It actually runs it and the members of parliament are ceremonial.
[57:42.920 --> 57:45.440]  Hour number two with critical intel straight ahead.
[57:45.440 --> 57:50.720]  Stay with us are 2021.
[57:50.720 --> 57:54.040]  I have a question to ask you.
[57:54.040 --> 57:59.800]  Why would you spend your money this Christmas season to buy gifts for friends and family
[57:59.800 --> 58:05.680]  and loved ones with the establishment, with the big corporations that are dedicated to
[58:05.680 --> 58:12.440]  waging war on all of our freedoms and suppressing us and forcing medical tyranny on us?
[58:12.440 --> 58:17.040]  I've never backed down to tyranny and we've had incredible success in fighting them.
[58:17.040 --> 58:18.440]  Thanks for your support.
[58:18.440 --> 58:25.520]  But now as 2021 comes to a close, I want to encourage you now more than ever to support
[58:25.520 --> 58:30.600]  the truth and you do that at infowarstore.com.
[58:30.600 --> 58:35.320]  Storewide free shipping, double patriot police running right now, huge deals of bottom mineral
[58:35.320 --> 58:41.200]  fusion, DNA force plus, lung cleanse and turbo force and these are really amazing high quality
[58:41.200 --> 58:43.880]  products that also fund the info war.
[58:43.880 --> 58:50.440]  The only way you fail is not taking action.
[58:50.440 --> 59:00.040]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change
[59:00.040 --> 59:04.440]  that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put
[59:04.440 --> 59:05.440]  in place.
[59:05.440 --> 59:10.920]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[59:10.920 --> 59:16.440]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[59:16.440 --> 59:19.320]  faces from the light of the sun.
[59:19.320 --> 59:27.520]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[59:27.520 --> 59:31.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[59:31.920 --> 59:34.720]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[59:34.720 --> 59:38.840]  Cloud Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[59:38.840 --> 59:40.760]  the world ID and carbon taxes.
[59:40.760 --> 59:43.840]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[59:43.840 --> 59:47.280]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[59:47.280 --> 59:51.440]  Non-compliance, non-compliance, non-compliance.
[59:51.440 --> 1:00:00.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:00.600 --> 1:00:02.320]  Mark Zuckerberg's doing.
[1:00:02.320 --> 1:00:13.000]  It came out more than five years ago in his own company Documents when whistleblowers warned
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:18.720]  the world that he was trying to isolate people to be only on Facebook and to be depressed
[1:00:18.720 --> 1:00:24.320]  and alone so that avatars or fake computer entities would be their only friends, thus
[1:00:24.320 --> 1:00:27.640]  taking full control of the user's mind.
[1:00:27.640 --> 1:00:33.120]  That's just a beta test for what's now rolling out with Facebook claiming ownership of the
[1:00:33.120 --> 1:00:39.720]  metaverse and buying up hundreds of VR companies and now trying to force itters and employees
[1:00:39.720 --> 1:00:45.720]  to solely live in a fantasy controlled and orchestrated by Zuckerberg and the organizations
[1:00:45.720 --> 1:00:47.220]  that he works with.
[1:00:47.220 --> 1:00:52.520]  This priest class wants to lock us in our five senses here in the third dimension and
[1:00:52.520 --> 1:00:59.920]  to do that they're creating an artificial electronic prison or matrix to seduce us into
[1:00:59.920 --> 1:01:03.640]  giving up control of our bodies and our minds.
[1:01:03.640 --> 1:01:06.680]  This is the greatest deception ever.
[1:01:06.680 --> 1:01:11.440]  World is digging in because it knows humanity is waking up and that group consciousness
[1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:16.680]  is forming and that we are beginning to transcend the third dimension.
[1:01:16.680 --> 1:01:21.400]  Everything that's being launched against us is an attempt to hold us in the third dimension
[1:01:21.400 --> 1:01:27.560]  and not just enslave us but finally completely destroy us and absorb our energy into this
[1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:29.200]  system they're building.
[1:01:29.200 --> 1:01:31.640]  This is beyond the St. Canick ritual.
[1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:35.560]  This is beyond anything you've read about in science fiction because this is actually
[1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:40.280]  happening in the real world today and we have discovered their secrets.
[1:01:40.280 --> 1:01:45.000]  We've discovered how to stop them and we have put it all together in an easy to understand
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:50.400]  system that gives you the tools to not just defeat the globalists but to transcend to
[1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:51.400]  this level.
[1:01:51.400 --> 1:01:56.000]  It's so important for all of you that already know this and have already witnessed this
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:01.320]  for yourselves to understand you are the leaders of the future that must go to the next level
[1:02:01.320 --> 1:02:06.600]  so that you and I and others working together can free the rest of humanity before they
[1:02:06.600 --> 1:02:10.440]  get trapped in this artificial matrix system the globalists are building.
[1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:11.760]  All I'm offering is the truth.
[1:02:11.760 --> 1:02:14.800]  The film The Matrix made in 1999 is not original.
[1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:21.200]  Documents came out in 1990 from the late 1970s where NASA and DARPA were developing a plan
[1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:25.960]  very similar to The Matrix and all that information is now public.
[1:02:25.960 --> 1:02:31.600]  They're attempting to seduce us to give up our five senses not just holding us a third
[1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:36.720]  dimension but actually creating an artificial slave system so that they can turn us into
[1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:39.120]  their programmable slaves.
[1:02:39.120 --> 1:02:42.960]  Humanity are not robots no matter how many times Ray Kurzweil and the social engineers
[1:02:42.960 --> 1:02:47.400]  tell us this but they are trying to turn us into robots.
[1:02:47.400 --> 1:02:51.800]  That's why in December of 2021 we are launching Reset Wars.
[1:02:51.800 --> 1:03:05.960]  Find out more information at resetwars.com Here's the CEO of the big vaccine company.
[1:03:05.960 --> 1:03:11.160]  Allow me personal questions I know that you don't particularly that you're not particularly
[1:03:11.160 --> 1:03:17.040]  fond of answering personal questions but you and your wife Dr. Tuici you play such a central
[1:03:17.040 --> 1:03:25.480]  role in the development of the virus in the development of the virus in the development
[1:03:25.480 --> 1:03:27.480]  of the virus.
[1:03:27.480 --> 1:03:33.560]  I have heard that you yourself have not taken the vaccine yet why not.
[1:03:33.560 --> 1:03:39.600]  So I am I am legally not allowed to take the vaccine at the moment we of course consider
[1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:45.960]  to make that possible it is more important for us that our co-workers and partners get
[1:03:45.960 --> 1:03:54.560]  vaccinated so our goal is to produce more than 1.3 billion doses in 2021 and that can
[1:03:54.560 --> 1:04:01.240]  only be done if we can really continue to work 24-7 without any interruption and we
[1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:10.280]  need to ensure that we protect the co-workers and our team members from COVID-19 infection
[1:04:10.280 --> 1:04:16.280]  because that would mean interruption and delay and waste of vaccine doses and therefore we
[1:04:16.280 --> 1:04:24.760]  consider to make an extra batch independent from the from the European contingent available
[1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:31.160]  to to collaboration partners who are supporting us and to our team members.
[1:04:31.160 --> 1:04:35.960]  But I understand why why are you not legally allowed to take the vaccine.
[1:04:35.960 --> 1:04:44.960]  Because you know that there is there is a priority the vaccine is not allowed to to to to to be
[1:04:44.960 --> 1:04:50.240]  taken outside of this priority list and what is also important we will there's the Moderna
[1:04:50.240 --> 1:05:03.760]  CEO we'll be right back with Gary Franke our 2021 Cyber Week specials end on Monday December

[1:06:23.720 --> 1:06:43.960]  well quite the intro there gary crunchy my old friend on the sky more than 16 years came
[1:06:43.960 --> 1:06:48.600]  into town we got a steak last night in this dystopia there's still some good things left
[1:06:48.600 --> 1:06:52.880]  though they're trying to get rid of those and wow so much to talk about you know he started
[1:06:52.880 --> 1:06:56.880]  a lone lantern society more than 16 years ago when I'm spoken a big event you have with
[1:06:56.880 --> 1:07:01.320]  thousands of people in Chicago and over the years he's got hundreds and hundreds of millions
[1:07:01.320 --> 1:07:07.920]  of views on multiple big very exciting channels that he's developed the next news network that
[1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:12.840]  is on many many platforms at Gary Franchi on Twitter Gary good to have you here with
[1:07:12.840 --> 1:07:13.840]  us man.
[1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:18.280]  Alex it's great to be here in your studio it's been a long time since I've been here
[1:07:18.280 --> 1:07:26.880]  last time I was here we were filming the William Lewis documentary Camp Fima 2 and that film
[1:07:26.880 --> 1:07:32.560]  has been so prophetic for the times that we're living in right now wow yeah they're now announcing
[1:07:32.560 --> 1:07:36.200]  that the lock nouns are permanent and that the mask are permanent and that you've got
[1:07:36.200 --> 1:07:39.520]  to take multiple shots a year that's permanent it's being announced in Europe being announced
[1:07:39.520 --> 1:07:43.600]  in New Zealand being announced in Canada and Democrats are now announcing in here well
[1:07:43.600 --> 1:07:48.240]  that's a terrifying prospect to consider I know that we are going to have a lot of pushback
[1:07:48.240 --> 1:07:54.560]  across the country and that pushback is absolutely necessary to preserve the freedoms we have
[1:07:54.560 --> 1:08:01.480]  in this country the Constitution that prevents that type of authoritarian elements to force
[1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:07.720]  vaccines on the American people and the American people need to need to recognize that we will
[1:08:07.720 --> 1:08:11.920]  not be coerced we will not be forced into accepting these things now if people want
[1:08:11.920 --> 1:08:15.440]  to take them that's that's fine that's on them let them do what they're going to do
[1:08:15.440 --> 1:08:20.760]  that that's the point of freedom is that we have the opportunity to choose now you go
[1:08:20.760 --> 1:08:23.720]  buy a gun at the store and blow your head off if you want if you want to do that what
[1:08:23.720 --> 1:08:27.240]  do you do about the children though when the parents want to give us experimental crap
[1:08:27.240 --> 1:08:33.360]  to their children when mommy wants to become dr. Mingola's mistress well I think that when
[1:08:33.360 --> 1:08:39.840]  they have implemented this into the schools and they're removing parental consent we have
[1:08:39.840 --> 1:08:44.560]  to we have to be fully on guard you know I have friends think about this the left doesn't
[1:08:44.560 --> 1:08:48.560]  want to be able to spank your children but but but but they want to be able to inject
[1:08:48.560 --> 1:08:53.280]  children the state's trying to even like you said circumvent parents well that's I mean
[1:08:53.280 --> 1:08:58.400]  that's what the state wants to do that's authoritarian dictatorship happening in this country and
[1:08:58.400 --> 1:09:02.180]  they're doing it through the public school systems you're right I mean this is this is
[1:09:02.180 --> 1:09:06.800]  authoritarianism 101 it's everything we always warned of Gary it's here you know what Alex
[1:09:06.800 --> 1:09:11.840]  years ago when we would present this information on the multiple media channels that we've
[1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:16.240]  been using over the years to get the message out to the American people we've been warning
[1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:21.840]  about this and now it is here it's at our doorstep it is unfolding and it is terrifying
[1:09:21.840 --> 1:09:27.520]  to watch absolutely they put together just our archive is to because it was all over
[1:09:27.520 --> 1:09:34.480]  the news about the CIA running and protecting pedophile rings and the archive is very quickly
[1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:40.080]  put together like a 10 minute clips going back 15 plus years 20 years in this first
[1:09:40.080 --> 1:09:44.960]  club Alex Jones exposes elite pedophile rings long ago we probably need to change that headline
[1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:51.520]  to something you know with the actual original date decades ago but I mean this is really
[1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:57.400]  a seedy system beyond seedy that's running things well the the Galene Maxwell trial is
[1:09:57.400 --> 1:10:01.400]  happening right now no one's talking about it no one no one in the mainstream press is
[1:10:01.400 --> 1:10:08.080]  in me look we had the written house trial right that was on every single media outlet
[1:10:08.080 --> 1:10:14.200]  he was being demonized on CNN MSNBC all the channels were demonizing him they they couldn't
[1:10:14.200 --> 1:10:18.520]  stop talking about it and then they freak out when he gets off but where where's the
[1:10:18.520 --> 1:10:24.280]  coverage on Galene Maxwell all we get is a sketch we get a sketch artist and a couple
[1:10:24.280 --> 1:10:28.960]  transcripts that are difficult to even locate they're sweeping up they're sweeping this
[1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:33.160]  all under the rug they don't want the American people to hear what's actually happening at
[1:10:33.160 --> 1:10:39.840]  the highest levels in government and Galene Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein are only the tip
[1:10:39.840 --> 1:10:44.320]  of the iceberg because they have been they have been they're just one they're just one
[1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:52.640]  faction in the greater scheme that the elite are using children and sex and black male
[1:10:52.640 --> 1:10:59.040]  to control the political elite well that's right and we also have this student up in
[1:10:59.040 --> 1:11:03.440]  Michigan that shot some people and killed him horrible terrible punishing death penalty
[1:11:03.440 --> 1:11:07.560]  whatever but then they arrest the parents now I'm gonna arresting the school because
[1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:11.680]  they need to search his bags properly and we know every facet about them but then a
[1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:16.160]  guy runs over 40 something people kill six oh it's an accident it's a tragedy because
[1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:20.280]  he's black I mean that agenda there too is incredible what we're witnessing through the
[1:11:20.280 --> 1:11:27.120]  mainstream media CNN MSNBC all the channels out there they're putting out these narratives
[1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:32.720]  and they are just I mean the media is destroying this country like beyond anything we've ever
[1:11:32.720 --> 1:11:36.800]  seen and that is exactly why I started next news network that's why you are doing what
[1:11:36.800 --> 1:11:40.960]  you're doing with info wars because we can recognize these narratives we can push back
[1:11:40.960 --> 1:11:46.800]  against these narratives we have to correct the narratives because they've got satellites
[1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:51.520]  they've got the broadcast they've got the cable channels and people you can you know you can
[1:11:51.520 --> 1:11:55.440]  talk to people Alex you can tell where they get their talking points you can tell which
[1:11:55.440 --> 1:12:00.520]  channels they're watching just based on the messaging that they are the argument points
[1:12:00.520 --> 1:12:05.520]  that they throw back at you but thankfully info wars next news network we are pushing
[1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:09.840]  back against these false narratives every single day and if we don't push back against
[1:12:09.840 --> 1:12:15.640]  these false narratives if we don't continue to fight with true information truth we're
[1:12:15.640 --> 1:12:19.760]  gonna lose this country and that's why every single day I work behind the scenes in front
[1:12:19.760 --> 1:12:24.440]  of the camera like you so we can correct narratives just your YouTube channels got hundreds of
[1:12:24.440 --> 1:12:30.520]  millions of years we were the first conservative news YouTube channel to break a billion views
[1:12:30.520 --> 1:12:34.960]  a billion say billion and I don't know where your channel was when you got the platform
[1:12:34.960 --> 1:12:39.680]  from YouTube so I can't speak to that number that you have five billion but this is great
[1:12:39.680 --> 1:12:45.320]  to your well how many billions of years 1.3 billion views on YouTube right now we've got
[1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:49.560]  over two million subscribers and the whole channel was designed because I didn't like
[1:12:49.560 --> 1:12:54.360]  what I saw them doing a run to Ron Paul back in 2012 I said I'm never gonna let this happen
[1:12:54.360 --> 1:13:01.880]  again I watched how did we first meet we met 2006 was like 2006 or 7 we were at a Chicago
[1:13:01.880 --> 1:13:08.000]  conference for 9 11 truth we were marching in the street together my wife was there it
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:14.960]  was a my buddy Chad he was there and that's really where we met crazy his time but I mean
[1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:18.600]  I was going off UN documents back in that they plan to do all this that's how we knew
[1:13:18.600 --> 1:13:22.480]  the plan was there because we knew these are serious groups we were warning people now
[1:13:22.480 --> 1:13:27.040]  it's here and so I don't know what they do about our credibility I'm not trying to brag
[1:13:27.040 --> 1:13:31.040]  we're in danger because of this not just me all of us they people now listen to us because
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:35.840]  they know we're not lying so as things get worse we get more powerful which puts us in
[1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:39.740]  more danger so we all need your prayers I mean this is like being a test pilot getting
[1:13:39.740 --> 1:13:43.360]  shot up on a rocket here folks I can tell you and you're all under attack as well you're
[1:13:43.360 --> 1:13:48.120]  all under attack I'm just saying you imagine the position we're in it's crazy I remember
[1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:54.520]  when Hillary Clinton was she she brought you up by name because because you're so effective
[1:13:54.520 --> 1:13:58.680]  you know right after the election Hillary was out there also in Australia she was talking
[1:13:58.680 --> 1:14:04.160]  about all the headlines and stuff we were reporting on as well I mean we are effective our voices
[1:14:04.160 --> 1:14:08.240]  are effective and that's why they are so terrified because their agenda has been in play for
[1:14:08.240 --> 1:14:13.720]  a very long time Alex you know this we you have been talking about this for years their
[1:14:13.720 --> 1:14:18.200]  agenda has been in play now there this is their end game they're using COVID as the
[1:14:18.200 --> 1:14:23.760]  end game to push their totalitarian agenda years ago when when we put off that first
[1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:31.640]  movie or the second movie the camp FEMA the camp FEMA 2 we talked about SARS we talked
[1:14:31.640 --> 1:14:36.720]  about the bird flu we talked about the concentration camps and how the National Guard would be
[1:14:36.720 --> 1:14:41.600]  used to you know I totally forgot those FEMA films that weren't you the producer I can't
[1:14:41.600 --> 1:14:44.800]  remember me as William Lewis and I produced that's right I mean I know you were in it
[1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:49.040]  I know you were here helping run it but yeah we ought to take that and get clips that predicted
[1:14:49.040 --> 1:14:53.200]  it all too yeah how they would use the virus and take over and now and now and we were
[1:14:53.200 --> 1:14:57.600]  conspiracy theorists when we talk about it and now look what look where we are you know
[1:14:57.600 --> 1:15:02.760]  the Chicago Tribune was putting on a hip piece on me and they had they were they were goading
[1:15:02.760 --> 1:15:07.240]  me on Twitter like oh where the concentration camps Ranchi oh oh I'm sorry they're they're
[1:15:07.240 --> 1:15:14.680]  in Australia okay yeah coming to America soon and it's on the CDC sites that they're
[1:15:14.680 --> 1:15:18.840]  going to turn all the neighborhoods into camps and have armed guards they call it a shielding
[1:15:18.840 --> 1:15:23.720]  in place and even the quote healthy that children will be taken from homes to government shield
[1:15:23.720 --> 1:15:29.280]  facilities for their safety so and then we have the head of the UN program Dr. Ryan saying
[1:15:29.280 --> 1:15:33.400]  we're going to come in and take your kids from you and he's just smiling with his dirty
[1:15:33.400 --> 1:15:38.680]  ugly teeth I mean these freaking people are evil the people they're evil this is a this
[1:15:38.680 --> 1:15:43.720]  is an overarching demonic and satanic agenda you know I'm a Christian I can see the signs
[1:15:43.720 --> 1:15:50.200]  I can see the writing on the wall the Lord the Lord demanded us commanded us to recognize
[1:15:50.200 --> 1:15:56.280]  the signs of the season and I believe that we are truly and firmly I totally agree Gary
[1:15:56.280 --> 1:16:04.600]  stay right there I have a question to ask you why would you spend your money this Christmas
[1:16:04.600 --> 1:16:10.520]  season to buy gifts for friends and family and loved ones with the establishment with
[1:16:10.520 --> 1:16:17.240]  the big corporations that are dedicated to waging war on all of our freedoms and suppressing
[1:16:17.240 --> 1:16:22.880]  us and forcing medical tyranny on us I've never backed down to tyranny we've had incredible
[1:16:22.880 --> 1:16:29.200]  successes fighting them thanks for your support but now as 2021 comes to a close I want to
[1:16:29.200 --> 1:16:36.600]  encourage you now more than ever to support the truth and you do that at info more store

[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:03.280]  the purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today
[1:17:03.280 --> 1:17:09.240]  half the population has lined up for an untested deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[1:17:09.240 --> 1:17:14.080]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease the perpetrators
[1:17:14.080 --> 1:17:18.920]  of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up
[1:17:18.920 --> 1:17:24.360]  to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years for those of us who have
[1:17:24.360 --> 1:17:29.280]  awoken from the spell we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling
[1:17:29.280 --> 1:17:34.640]  to see but there is only two things to do we continue sounding the alarm because it's
[1:17:34.640 --> 1:17:39.680]  a numbers game if enough people awaken from the cold spell then we win but even when we
[1:17:39.680 --> 1:17:46.320]  win and we eventually will the days of convenience are soon coming to an end and so we must prepare
[1:17:46.320 --> 1:17:52.440]  get up to a years worth of storeable foods water filtration survival gear seeds short
[1:17:52.440 --> 1:17:58.440]  wave radios and life saving knowledge at info or store dot com I've been fighting as hard
[1:17:58.440 --> 1:18:04.960]  as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist I wanted to stop their agenda I wanted to wake
[1:18:04.960 --> 1:18:11.080]  up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operation but we failed yes
[1:18:11.080 --> 1:18:16.480]  a lot of people are awake yes we're not getting caught flat footed but they are going ahead
[1:18:16.480 --> 1:18:21.760]  with their full operational the industrialization great reset and that's why it's more important
[1:18:21.760 --> 1:18:26.520]  than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because
[1:18:26.520 --> 1:18:30.800]  people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth so we've got an information warfare
[1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:35.040]  of the enemy and try to stop their agenda we've also got to get personally prepared and one
[1:18:35.040 --> 1:18:38.560]  of the number one things to do is high quality storeable food we've got the best food ready
[1:18:38.560 --> 1:18:43.360]  to ship at very affordable prices at info or store dot com so whether it's a month or
[1:18:43.360 --> 1:18:48.400]  a six month or a year supply or specialty diets it's ready to ship right now locker orders
[1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:53.480]  in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits because believe me
[1:18:53.480 --> 1:18:59.000]  serious times are coming get ready at info or store dot com you and run contact tracers
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:04.400]  aren't coming they're here all over the world from australia to the united states from canada
[1:19:04.400 --> 1:19:08.760]  to germany these tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go then coming to your
[1:19:08.760 --> 1:19:14.600]  house and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their
[1:19:14.600 --> 1:19:19.960]  facilities and they're planning the next year to expand their shield process where they come
[1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:24.680]  and take quote healthy people away and put up a facilities for their safety this is nothing
[1:19:24.680 --> 1:19:29.000]  less than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:33.200]  faraday cages many of which are made here in america and are very compliant meaning

[1:20:32.760 --> 1:20:39.840]  alex jones it's wrong jeffrey ebbstein is totally innocent everything's fine we'll talk
[1:20:39.840 --> 1:20:44.600]  about some of this coming up next segment but i wanted to get back to a whole cobert
[1:20:44.600 --> 1:20:50.880]  tyranny rollout with gary franchey of the next news network gary i want to play you
[1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:57.200]  a few clips here here is the mayor of new york the outgoing mayor de blasio announcing
[1:20:57.200 --> 1:21:01.600]  a vaccine mandate for all private sector employees in new york city even though federal courts
[1:21:01.600 --> 1:21:07.640]  have already blocked biden three times they're now just doing an inrun around what the left
[1:21:07.640 --> 1:21:13.480]  always does at the city level trying to push an illegal gene therapy on people that totally
[1:21:13.480 --> 1:21:19.000]  violates the nirnberg code i mean this is war crimes business here is i'm not saying
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:24.880]  he's a pedophile but if i was going to cast somebody for a movie about pedophiles and
[1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:29.080]  there was like a king daddy pedophile it'd be de blasio and his minion would be ryan
[1:21:29.080 --> 1:21:32.480]  stelter uh but but so we don't know if he's molesting children but we know he wants to
[1:21:32.480 --> 1:21:37.280]  stick deadly needles in them full of deadly poison here it is we in new york city have
[1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:43.960]  decided to use a preemptive strike to really do something bold to stop the further growth
[1:21:43.960 --> 1:21:48.880]  of coveted and the dangers it's causing to all of us so as of today we're going to announce
[1:21:48.880 --> 1:21:54.240]  a first in the nation measure our health commissioner will announce a vaccine mandate
[1:21:54.240 --> 1:22:00.800]  for private sector employers across the board all private sector employers in new york city
[1:22:00.800 --> 1:22:05.440]  will be covered by this vaccine mandate as of december twenty seventh we're going to
[1:22:05.440 --> 1:22:10.920]  have some other measures as well to really focus on maximizing vaccination quickly so
[1:22:10.920 --> 1:22:16.640]  we can get ahead of amicron and all the other challenges we're facing right now the prolific
[1:22:16.640 --> 1:22:24.400]  ben garrison graphic artists political cartoonist artists that are your fan of gary he put out
[1:22:24.400 --> 1:22:28.200]  one last week that i'm gonna actually order a print of and hang on the wall uh and it
[1:22:28.200 --> 1:22:33.400]  shows the elephant in the room says vaccines don't work with fousy as a clown announcing
[1:22:33.400 --> 1:22:37.240]  oh now you gotta get your booster shot israel's moving on to their fourth and fifth shots
[1:22:37.240 --> 1:22:41.560]  europe's moving to its third and fourth shots and everywhere you have the highest inoculation
[1:22:41.560 --> 1:22:45.280]  levels you have the highest levels of people being sick so the elephant in the room is
[1:22:45.280 --> 1:22:50.880]  it doesn't work and i can't believe they're still moving forward with this crap gary well
[1:22:50.880 --> 1:22:56.640]  they're putting these injections into people's bodies and then suddenly you see the spike
[1:22:56.640 --> 1:23:01.800]  in infections across the country across the world what does that tell you does it tell
[1:23:01.800 --> 1:23:06.200]  you that the vaccine is not is people are shedding they're walking around the vaccine
[1:23:06.200 --> 1:23:11.920]  is creating the delta variant that they're so concerned about the omicron variant these
[1:23:11.920 --> 1:23:17.480]  are questions that need to be answered how do we get the message out that the elephant
[1:23:17.480 --> 1:23:23.040]  in the room is that the vaccines don't work how well you have to keep talking you can't
[1:23:23.040 --> 1:23:29.080]  you cannot be silent when you look at the data that is out there you can only present
[1:23:29.080 --> 1:23:34.400]  the data but here's what's crazy is that even when you present the data what up whatever
[1:23:34.400 --> 1:23:39.760]  social medium you decide to present on then you get slapped with this fact check in this
[1:23:39.760 --> 1:23:44.960]  the censorship warning and even when you're presenting actual data from the cdc or the
[1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:50.000]  world health organization or actual medical studies how does that happen that that's what
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:54.160]  blows my mind out well exactly senator paul's been censored multiple times by youtube for
[1:23:54.160 --> 1:23:58.840]  senate speeches where he read an israeli study and others about how learned immunity is much
[1:23:58.840 --> 1:24:03.560]  better than the shot well that's not even true he was helping them saying oh it has
[1:24:03.560 --> 1:24:07.880]  better immunity natural immunity the shot the shot actually erases your immunity and
[1:24:07.880 --> 1:24:12.320]  all the major studies completely gone in six months and after that it actually drops your
[1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:17.440]  natural immunity level that you already actually had so now the american heart association
[1:24:17.440 --> 1:24:21.520]  got censored by twitter last week for pointing out that the vaccines aren't vaccines and
[1:24:21.520 --> 1:24:25.960]  say on the insert it can give you a heart attack well then you had to believe it was a was
[1:24:25.960 --> 1:24:31.720]  a forbes i think a forbes writer they rewrote the headline after he said that the mRNA actually
[1:24:31.720 --> 1:24:37.160]  does alter your dna and then there was outcry and he had changed his headline i mean they
[1:24:37.160 --> 1:24:42.600]  are rewriting the information that the news articles that are that go out there that do
[1:24:42.600 --> 1:24:47.400]  speak truth they get backlash and then oh my goodness we need to change the story because
[1:24:47.400 --> 1:24:51.400]  people are waking up and it's even happening in the mainstream press and that's what's
[1:24:51.400 --> 1:24:56.080]  terrifying absolutely now if you look at how bad new zealand australia are or if you saw
[1:24:56.080 --> 1:25:00.400]  it earlier before he came on we played the clip of the prime minister of new zealand
[1:25:00.400 --> 1:25:04.120]  saying oh yeah though this is never going to end you're always going to have new shots
[1:25:04.120 --> 1:25:08.760]  you're always going to have to have a vaccine passport which we always knew was coming and
[1:25:08.760 --> 1:25:13.800]  now in a bunch of different democrat strongholds including the state of oregon they are announcing
[1:25:13.800 --> 1:25:20.560]  permanent mask permanent masking in oregon here it is oregon moves to make indoor mask
[1:25:20.560 --> 1:25:26.040]  mandate permanent but it gets better i have the k atu newscast will play next segment
[1:25:26.040 --> 1:25:31.880]  but in it they say permanent does not mean permanent so what does it mean this is 1984
[1:25:31.880 --> 1:25:36.360]  maybe they're just see how it works you know up is down left is you know left is right
[1:25:36.360 --> 1:25:41.160]  you know black is white you know this is the world we're living in and it's all it's all
[1:25:41.160 --> 1:25:46.440]  biblical alex take it goes all the way back to scripture you and i have and the people
[1:25:46.440 --> 1:25:50.240]  watching right now have a front row seat to the end of the world so make sure your soul
[1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:54.640]  is ready because i was about to say this morning i was just really upset about all this now
[1:25:54.640 --> 1:25:57.440]  they're killing the children and hurting them right now and i was feeling really guilty
[1:25:57.440 --> 1:26:01.240]  and really the holy spirit just said listen this is about the spirit it's about doing
[1:26:01.240 --> 1:26:05.440]  the right thing and it's about choices people make and so just be as hardcore as you can
[1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:09.680]  and try to protect the children and warn people and then i'll do the rest god helps those
[1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:15.160]  that help themselves we just have to make sure that we as a nation we have to turn back
[1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:20.000]  to god and we have to have politicians in place who are actually going to fulfill the
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:25.320]  will of the people we just recently had 80 republicans who signed on to a to a bill that
[1:26:25.320 --> 1:26:31.400]  would create a vaccine database of people who were all vaccinated or not 80 republicans
[1:26:31.400 --> 1:26:36.760]  did this i mean all new cars in the infrastructure bill now starting next year to have tracker
[1:26:36.760 --> 1:26:42.160]  chips where the government can track everything you do and kill your car and also have a alcohol
[1:26:42.160 --> 1:26:47.320]  blow tube or some sort of mechanism to gauge if you've had any alcohol so what if you have
[1:26:47.320 --> 1:26:52.920]  a glass of wine with dinner now so you can't drive your wife home and it's reported back
[1:26:52.920 --> 1:26:56.520]  this is the nanny state so everybody thought oh the home assistance here to help me no the
[1:26:56.520 --> 1:27:00.840]  home assistance can be in your car whether you like it or not excuse me sir you've turned
[1:27:00.840 --> 1:27:06.160]  your assistant off any reason you've turned your assistant off but we're conspiracy theorists
[1:27:06.160 --> 1:27:11.240]  when we go ahead and present this information we're demonized for speaking the truth while
[1:27:11.240 --> 1:27:15.640]  the mainstream media continues to push the they are the ones pushing misinformation
[1:27:15.640 --> 1:27:19.440]  on the american people when they go ahead and say you have to have a mask forever you
[1:27:19.440 --> 1:27:24.040]  could take multiple booster shots when they can show you then the data that these things
[1:27:24.040 --> 1:27:28.480]  are ineffective gary how bad is it going to get before it gets better i mean i hear what
[1:27:28.480 --> 1:27:33.320]  you're saying i guess it just means any christ world government into the world stuff five
[1:27:33.320 --> 1:27:38.320]  ten years i mean i mean how long you know the lord the lord is the only one who knows
[1:27:38.320 --> 1:27:46.840]  a date alex all we can do is continue to attempt to extend the dispensation of grace that the
[1:27:46.840 --> 1:27:55.000]  lord has we he's the only one that can extend that deadline right he's the only one so when
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:28:00.680]  we have shows like yours shows like mine i believe that we are doing the lord's work
[1:28:00.680 --> 1:28:06.360]  by awakening the american people by extending the dispensation of grace allowing this nation
[1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:13.200]  to repent allowing the american people to move forward and find the elected officials who
[1:28:13.200 --> 1:28:18.280]  will listen to the american people hold those accountable who are in office so that we can
[1:28:18.280 --> 1:28:24.800]  prolong this time just like with neneva and jona going they got a hundred year reprieve
[1:28:24.800 --> 1:28:30.280]  this is a live third dimensional non simulation war game folks everybody every culture knows
[1:28:30.280 --> 1:28:34.440]  it everybody knows it the bible is clear and you now the globalists know it this is a war
[1:28:34.440 --> 1:28:40.000]  game this is a war game and it's to see if your good soul are a bad soul and right now

[1:33:47.400 --> 1:33:55.720]  and now in oregon they have put through an emergency regulation saying that it's permanent
[1:33:56.280 --> 1:34:00.920]  that mask will be worn forever and by the way singing in last year ran a headline saying
[1:34:00.920 --> 1:34:06.840]  it'll be like seatbelts so we knew they're playing and we'll talk with gary francy of next
[1:34:06.840 --> 1:34:10.520]  news network in a moment about why they're so obsessed with these masks and how it's the symbol
[1:34:10.520 --> 1:34:19.880]  of slavery and beyond but here is a clip out of local television news where they are happily on k atu
[1:34:20.600 --> 1:34:26.440]  reporting this dystopia and adding that little twist at the end that permanent is not permanent
[1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:33.400]  four plus four does not equal eight one plus one is not equal to black is not black white is not
[1:34:33.960 --> 1:34:39.960]  white green is not green sky is not blue and these vaccines work wonderfully that's why they
[1:34:39.960 --> 1:34:45.480]  don't work you've got to take more of them here it is permanent you know that might scare a lot
[1:34:45.480 --> 1:34:50.600]  of people that might they might think oh my gosh are we gonna be masking for forever what is a
[1:34:50.600 --> 1:34:56.360]  permanent ruling do why not just extend this very rule permanent permanent means indefinitely
[1:34:56.360 --> 1:35:02.280]  it doesn't necessarily mean permanent we could repeal it as well but we are only allowed to
[1:35:02.280 --> 1:35:08.040]  have a temporary rule for 180 days and if anything that goes beyond 180 days we cannot extend it
[1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:14.840]  temporarily it's either you know adopted formally or or letting and in the uk they're now putting
[1:35:14.840 --> 1:35:20.520]  up signs officially saying don't talk while you eat that can release the virus and don't look at
[1:35:20.520 --> 1:35:26.040]  people in the eyes australia also has signs of saying don't look at people looking at people
[1:35:26.040 --> 1:35:33.480]  is now a crime as well gary did he just say 180 days that's that's their permanent window is that
[1:35:33.480 --> 1:35:39.080]  what he said because because i remember you know what we're coming on two years now 15 days to
[1:35:39.080 --> 1:35:45.400]  flatten the curve 180 days they're not going to extend that when they don't need to yeah if 15 days
[1:35:45.400 --> 1:35:51.560]  is now two years then 180 days will basically be like 50 years yeah and that's that's permanent
[1:35:51.560 --> 1:35:56.840]  right i don't know how the listen we've already seen the biden mandates get struck down but when
[1:35:56.840 --> 1:36:02.680]  you have these elements happening at the state level you're going to see a mass exodus from
[1:36:02.680 --> 1:36:07.640]  these states like people are fleeing to texas they're fleeing to tennessee they're fleeing to
[1:36:07.640 --> 1:36:15.080]  florida for a reason because those governors there are not playing the game and you're going to see
[1:36:15.080 --> 1:36:21.080]  a mass exodus we're already seeing it alex well that's right no they love the mask and they've
[1:36:21.080 --> 1:36:24.680]  talked about this in some of their psychological memos that have come out it's a symbol of fear
[1:36:24.680 --> 1:36:30.040]  it's a symbol you're like a patient everyone is bad everyone's got to be suspect everybody's
[1:36:30.040 --> 1:36:34.600]  got to be tracked there's an article on info wars dot com uh today i'm gonna dig through my stack
[1:36:34.600 --> 1:36:38.840]  and pull it out here where it lays out all the quotes by the u n and all these corporations
[1:36:38.840 --> 1:36:43.480]  saying oh soon you'll have to have the smart app and it'll track everywhere you go oh it'll be the
[1:36:43.480 --> 1:36:49.320]  carbon tax app oh and it'll be your social credit score they're admitting it all when i see people
[1:36:49.320 --> 1:36:57.240]  walking around with masks you can only pity them you know i went into a a restaurant just the other
[1:36:57.240 --> 1:37:04.120]  day signs everywhere it says masks you must wear a mask to enter this i just walked in i wasn't
[1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:09.160]  wearing a mask everybody's wearing a mask everybody this is in this is the chicago area
[1:37:09.960 --> 1:37:15.080]  and people just looked at me like what is this guy crazy like i'm the i'm the moron i'm i'm the
[1:37:15.080 --> 1:37:20.840]  lunatic no no no people out there walking around with these masks driving their cars with masks on
[1:37:20.840 --> 1:37:26.840]  riding bikes with masks motorcycles with masks it is a sign of slavery and i will stand by that and
[1:37:26.840 --> 1:37:31.480]  i will not be a slave sadly though sadly when you travel commercial if you want to get to austin
[1:37:31.480 --> 1:37:38.440]  texas you gotta put the mask on i can't breathe the one on my face no i can't stand it i mean look
[1:37:38.440 --> 1:37:42.840]  at this guy in the school spraying disinfectant and all these disinfectants if they're not organic
[1:37:42.840 --> 1:37:50.840]  and most of them aren't lower fertility or very carcinogen car carcinogenic well who is it who
[1:37:50.840 --> 1:37:57.400]  stands to gain from all this it's pharma if everyone gets cancer then everybody can go get those
[1:37:57.400 --> 1:38:04.120]  treatments and then they make all this money i mean it's a big sick cycle that needs to be broken
[1:38:04.680 --> 1:38:10.760]  and we are breaking it every single day with truth and information awakening the american people
[1:38:10.760 --> 1:38:17.720]  awakening the globe to the times that we are living in if we do not stand up and speak out
[1:38:17.720 --> 1:38:25.000]  and resist we will lose this nation we will lose freedom all over the planet
[1:38:25.960 --> 1:38:33.720]  trado is just as bad as the leaders in australia and new zealand and trado said he wants to be
[1:38:33.720 --> 1:38:37.720]  like a chinese dictator just a few years ago he wanted to be like ggp and he said what system
[1:38:37.720 --> 1:38:41.480]  you like the most he said communist china's dictatorship dictatorships really get things
[1:38:41.480 --> 1:38:47.640]  done get things done you've got upwards of 40 percent of the public knows how to take these shots now
[1:38:47.640 --> 1:38:51.240]  people that have taken the two have gotten so sick poll show over 70 percent of them are saying
[1:38:51.240 --> 1:38:55.320]  they're not going to take a third or fourth shot and so he says well you can't get on planes you
[1:38:55.320 --> 1:39:02.360]  can't get on trains now as of a law that executive action that you know a dictatorial action as as of
[1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:07.720]  last week and now they're going you know what we had said you can go in grocery stores but actually
[1:39:07.720 --> 1:39:13.720]  no we're telling the stores to not let you go in and to harass you and if they don't they'll
[1:39:13.720 --> 1:39:23.400]  basically have liability here's a newscast out of canada also under level one masks are required
[1:39:23.400 --> 1:39:30.200]  in outdoor public spaces when physical distancing cannot be maintained physical distancing is
[1:39:30.200 --> 1:39:37.400]  required in public spaces where proof of vaccination is not required that means that malls
[1:39:37.400 --> 1:39:44.840]  grocery stores retail stores and salons and spas must enforce physical distancing between patrons
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:52.440]  alternatively they also have the option of requiring proof of full vaccination from all
[1:39:52.440 --> 1:39:58.440]  patrons but we will leave that decision up to individual businesses so this is indentured
[1:39:58.440 --> 1:40:03.240]  servitude the mask isn't just a symbol of slavery they're just putting toxins in us they're making
[1:40:03.240 --> 1:40:08.200]  globally it's all the same un corporate plan where these directives go out the nanny state
[1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:13.000]  lawyers threaten uh all these towns and cities oh you better get on board because of liability
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:17.880]  when the real liability is the tyranny that this is setting up i mean i remember when this thing
[1:40:17.880 --> 1:40:24.760]  started alex i was talking to a friend of mine jenny mercier and she's a doctor i said listen
[1:40:24.760 --> 1:40:29.640]  i said jenny this is all gonna be over soon right this this virus is gonna run its course it's
[1:40:29.640 --> 1:40:34.120]  gonna do its bell curve it's gonna it's gonna hit critical mass and it's gonna be over and she's
[1:40:34.120 --> 1:40:38.600]  like yeah that's that's what's gonna happen but when they have implemented all of these
[1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:44.360]  quote unquote safeguards with the masking with the social distancing they have prevented the
[1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:51.240]  actual virus from running its true course and they've turned that 15 day to flatten the curve
[1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:56.760]  that that curve has been stretched out over such a period and now they're forcing these injections
[1:40:56.760 --> 1:41:04.120]  on people only creating more and more variants and it's it's it's elongating the problem so that
[1:41:04.120 --> 1:41:09.320]  they can usher in their authoritarian rule that's right now they admit it's oh guess what it's for
[1:41:09.320 --> 1:41:13.480]  carbon taxes is for social credit score we're gonna lock you down using this down forever
[1:41:14.040 --> 1:41:19.080]  they are admitting forever and ever and ever this is their plan when i saw some video recently i
[1:41:19.080 --> 1:41:23.880]  believe it was in france there were people out there with grocery carts and they were trying to
[1:41:23.880 --> 1:41:29.320]  get in just to get food alex and they said oh if you don't show your vaccine your proof of vaccination
[1:41:29.320 --> 1:41:35.480]  you're not going to eat now i don't know if this is you know some people have compared this to perhaps
[1:41:35.480 --> 1:41:40.600]  the mark of the beast i don't know if that's the case at this point but the fact of the matter is
[1:41:40.600 --> 1:41:47.640]  that you have this you have to show your papers just to go and get food and then notice the trap
[1:41:47.640 --> 1:41:52.440]  oh sorry the first three shots didn't work israel's moving to its fourth and says then there'll be a
[1:41:52.440 --> 1:41:57.640]  fifth this is a formula to literally be able to put in our body what they want when they want
[1:41:58.360 --> 1:42:06.840]  in whatever way they are using this as a method to break down society to break down humanity and
[1:42:06.840 --> 1:42:12.600]  just get you used to showing your papers yeah that's what they want now you know history is
[1:42:12.600 --> 1:42:20.600]  clearly repeating itself look what's happening in austria germany australia i mean we've seen the
[1:42:20.600 --> 1:42:26.440]  template before show your papers or guess what you're going to get carted off to to a camp and
[1:42:26.440 --> 1:42:31.960]  you're going to be incinerated all right it's a worldwide program run by the un this is what's
[1:42:31.960 --> 1:42:38.680]  happening we are at the precipice of this now and if people don't recognize that then they will just
[1:42:38.680 --> 1:42:43.800]  be the victims of it when come back i want to explain to viewers and listeners i know most
[1:42:43.800 --> 1:42:47.880]  you probably know this but but why they're doing this this is just putting the chains on us and
[1:42:47.880 --> 1:42:51.240]  getting us immobilized for what they're really planning to do i'm gonna tell you what they're
[1:42:51.240 --> 1:42:55.080]  planning to do with gary franchi of the next news network straight ahead i'm alex jones
[1:42:56.760 --> 1:43:02.920]  let's go ahead take another call i am a worldly person meaning i like going to ball games i like
[1:43:02.920 --> 1:43:08.760]  going to concerts i like going to play golf i like going out to dinner i like the metropolitan life
[1:43:08.760 --> 1:43:15.000]  i like everything that comes with this but see i have the survival instinct that is to get the
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:20.440]  hell out of democrat run cities get the hell out of major metropolitan areas because unless
[1:43:20.440 --> 1:43:25.560]  we change course soon it's all crashing down is it time to just move out to the woods just time
[1:43:25.560 --> 1:43:29.720]  to go get a piece of property in the woods just get off grid just get the emergency food supplies
[1:43:29.720 --> 1:43:33.960]  just live off the land that's the survival instinct but see the worldly part of me that's
[1:43:33.960 --> 1:43:39.000]  still probably the majority part of me says no no no no stay in the city the survival instinct
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:43.000]  says get the hell out of anywhere there whatever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:48.840]  that's the that's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing
[1:43:48.840 --> 1:43:54.600]  as well but you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies and so we
[1:43:54.600 --> 1:44:00.440]  have the best ones at info wars store dot com info wars we've all heard about the pastor and his
[1:44:00.440 --> 1:44:06.360]  famous statement from inside a concentration camp in world war two that when they came for one group
[1:44:06.360 --> 1:44:10.200]  he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and then when they came for another group he
[1:44:10.200 --> 1:44:15.560]  wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and finally when they came for him there was nobody
[1:44:15.560 --> 1:44:19.720]  else to stand up oh the global social credit score that china is putting in that's banning people
[1:44:19.720 --> 1:44:24.040]  to three hours of video games a week and if you criticize the government you can never buy or sell
[1:44:24.040 --> 1:44:29.880]  again well that's that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of covid vaccine
[1:44:29.880 --> 1:44:34.040]  passports they even admit it now there's a has going to be a carbon tax attached to it they're
[1:44:34.040 --> 1:44:38.280]  going to track where you go what you do and decide where you can go and what you can do
[1:44:38.280 --> 1:44:44.440]  that's the lockdowns are about you'll accept that you'll accept anything so again the left is having
[1:44:44.440 --> 1:44:48.680]  fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending like they're part of the power structure
[1:44:48.680 --> 1:44:52.280]  but they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well we need to get back to basic
[1:44:52.280 --> 1:44:56.840]  human rights and promote them or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the
[1:44:56.840 --> 1:45:05.480]  globalist god created each and every one of us with free will but we look at the world system
[1:45:05.480 --> 1:45:10.760]  now openly announcing the mark of the beast everything that it's attempting to do is built
[1:45:10.760 --> 1:45:16.920]  around getting rid of our free will and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies our
[1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:26.200]  very productivity our very genetics our very future over to them they want control appropriation
[1:45:26.200 --> 1:45:31.400]  they want control of the relationships between men and women they want to bring a form of living
[1:45:31.400 --> 1:45:38.760]  death to our society our civilization all of us were formed and made in god's mind in god's image
[1:45:38.760 --> 1:45:44.520]  and given free will and make no mistake all of you alive today were created by god to be alive
[1:45:44.520 --> 1:45:50.040]  in this special time so that you could make the right decision free will and stand against evil
[1:45:50.920 --> 1:45:57.000]  and then for eternity win the great birthright prize of being aligned with god

[1:47:11.960 --> 1:47:22.920]  welcome back
[1:47:24.440 --> 1:47:29.720]  very franchise riding shotgun with us we have a investigative journalist on whistleblowers
[1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:35.240]  in the uk exposing on record how the government used cuba 19 as a pretext to do not resuscitate
[1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:40.280]  to not give treatment to thousands and thousands of elderly people to kill them some of which were
[1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:45.800]  awake and conscious and happy this is a death cult of mad scientist eugenicists that want to
[1:47:45.800 --> 1:47:53.000]  set the precedent for total control so that guest will be joining us coming up at the bottom of the
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:48:02.280]  next hour so definitely look forward to that coming up gary i want to get your take on this
[1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:07.560]  from your own deep research obviously cova just the pretext to get their world government in
[1:48:07.560 --> 1:48:13.400]  and what happens once they really get their total control of the resources in the infrastructure
[1:48:14.200 --> 1:48:21.080]  in place what is the new world orders plan what's their end game you know that's that's a
[1:48:21.080 --> 1:48:24.840]  that's a million dollar question alex once they have everything in place and we're watching the
[1:48:24.840 --> 1:48:33.160]  authoritarian state put its claws down dig deep using all these uh coveted and global warming
[1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:39.000]  and carbon taxes as their excuse to you know force you to change the light bulbs in your in
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:44.200]  your house but when when they get there then what are they just going to start exterminating people
[1:48:44.200 --> 1:48:49.240]  like we see the the georgia guide stones you know what's the two get the population 500 million
[1:48:49.240 --> 1:48:53.800]  500 million people that's the thing is all the estimates are if you cut half the carbon use
[1:48:53.800 --> 1:48:57.960]  it kills several billion people in a decade and cause giant wars and they say they're doing that
[1:48:57.960 --> 1:49:04.440]  so what's the point here i mean do they want to by 2030 they want carbon use cut in half by 2035
[1:49:04.440 --> 1:49:10.360]  they want it down to net zero so are they just going to kill off their their tax base don't
[1:49:10.360 --> 1:49:15.160]  they'd love the well that's it people think quote they need that they have they've stolen the world
[1:49:15.160 --> 1:49:20.440]  through fraud so and they've got all this fiat money they're delusional they they think they don't
[1:49:20.440 --> 1:49:24.920]  need us anymore so we're not just something that's worthless we have a negative value like garbage
[1:49:24.920 --> 1:49:28.920]  they want to dispose of and so the public has to understand that everything that comes out of
[1:49:28.920 --> 1:49:33.880]  neoliberalism and this whole leptis movement is about devaluing human life and training you to
[1:49:33.880 --> 1:49:37.800]  accept the murder of others but then you're going to be next i mean that's really all this is a
[1:49:37.800 --> 1:49:44.520]  barbarous human sacrifice death cult well it's about control it always has been about control
[1:49:44.520 --> 1:49:49.160]  because when the wealthy have all the money okay what's the next thing they want to be able to
[1:49:49.160 --> 1:49:54.760]  control humanity control society it's the power trip they want a power trip they want
[1:49:55.800 --> 1:50:01.720]  old corrupt kings they wanted to kidnap people's wives and rape them that's what this is but now
[1:50:01.720 --> 1:50:07.160]  they want to rape us with their gmo well that's why we need to continue to speak we need to
[1:50:07.160 --> 1:50:11.800]  continue to fight we need to continue to wake up the american people every single day alex
[1:50:11.800 --> 1:50:17.720]  we have to extend the dispensation of grace so that these these satanic elitists do not contain
[1:50:17.720 --> 1:50:25.080]  control us thankfully we live in a country with the constitution where the founders had enough
[1:50:25.080 --> 1:50:32.920]  foresight to give us the ability to keep and bear arms to protect the free state to have a free
[1:50:32.920 --> 1:50:38.280]  press in this country that's where i was going next america's got a lot of problems i get ashamed
[1:50:38.280 --> 1:50:41.800]  of the decadence sometimes the evil but there's also so much good in this nation there's our
[1:50:41.800 --> 1:50:45.960]  children that we know we're good and it's our job to defend them but then you compare the rest of
[1:50:45.960 --> 1:50:51.800]  the world again we are the best house in a bad neighborhood man well you can you can see it when
[1:50:51.800 --> 1:50:57.560]  you look at austria you look at germany you look at italy you look at greece australia you can see
[1:50:57.560 --> 1:51:02.120]  those nations that don't have a constitutional Canada sure canada as well you see these nations
[1:51:02.120 --> 1:51:07.720]  and how they are falling so quickly to the authoritarian covid rule because we have a
[1:51:07.720 --> 1:51:12.840]  constitution in place we are the last bastion of freedom in this world and because we think we have
[1:51:12.840 --> 1:51:16.360]  rights which we do the constitution doesn't give us our rights it simply enshrines them
[1:51:16.360 --> 1:51:21.400]  and puts up guards around to protect it so that we value it and defend it so that's the only reason
[1:51:21.400 --> 1:51:25.320]  it's like a seawall that's there but if we don't repair it and defend it and build it up and it
[1:51:25.320 --> 1:51:31.560]  will wash away we have to remember that these rights exist they are just because it's on a piece of
[1:51:31.560 --> 1:51:37.800]  paper doesn't mean anything those rights were granted and created by our heavenly father and we
[1:51:37.800 --> 1:51:43.160]  have to live out those rights we have to live out those freedoms because just like muscles we
[1:51:43.160 --> 1:51:47.560]  were born with muscles but if we don't use them the atrophy we die we've got to use the damn muscles
[1:51:47.560 --> 1:51:54.600]  folks we have a very serious problem because the public school systems are not teaching freedom
[1:51:54.600 --> 1:51:58.920]  they're teaching that because of the color of your skin you're inherently a racist through critical
[1:51:58.920 --> 1:52:04.440]  race theory clearly whoever pushes that as a communist enemy liar so we need to make sure
[1:52:04.440 --> 1:52:10.760]  we raise up our children to understand the power of our founding fathers now they were not without
[1:52:10.760 --> 1:52:16.840]  sin alex of course they were slave owners they they enslaved humans on their own properties
[1:52:16.840 --> 1:52:20.760]  and then they wrote this beautiful document we have to remember the words that they put on paper
[1:52:20.760 --> 1:52:23.880]  through that although i mean they tried to get rid of it even then but the points they were born
[1:52:23.880 --> 1:52:29.000]  into it exactly and then their idea helped to transcend out of it worldwide and that's why
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:33.320]  we have to remember them we have to say our founders names when they want everyone running
[1:52:33.320 --> 1:52:38.920]  around screaming you know brianna taylor's name when they tell rand paul that he and his wife when
[1:52:38.920 --> 1:52:43.000]  they're when the mob is descending upon them in washington dc and they're screaming with
[1:52:43.720 --> 1:52:49.560]  holding bricks saying you must say brianna taylor's name we must never forget to say the founders name
[1:52:49.560 --> 1:52:54.360]  even if they try to take those statues down try to rename why they're now saying get rid of the
[1:52:54.360 --> 1:52:59.560]  flag get rid of george washington thomas jefferson statues being taken down in new york uh teddy
[1:52:59.560 --> 1:53:04.040]  roosevelt was like the biggest republican ever for civil rights and got a bunch of stuff passed
[1:53:04.040 --> 1:53:09.160]  and they took him down because he's a white guy and again this is the globalist want you to hate
[1:53:09.160 --> 1:53:13.960]  the bill of rights and constitution because it's a shield those old white dudes are all dead thank
[1:53:13.960 --> 1:53:19.160]  god they thought up these ideas that the whole world mimicked but see america has to fall into
[1:53:19.160 --> 1:53:23.320]  tyranny and then nobody's going to oppose the un world government takeover worldwide alex when
[1:53:23.320 --> 1:53:28.840]  i saw that thomas jefferson statue coming down in new york city i wept i did a report on that i
[1:53:28.840 --> 1:53:34.280]  remember when the news first broke about it and then when it came out i wept when i saw that happening
[1:53:34.280 --> 1:53:38.360]  member trump just said three years ago he said if they can take down robert e lee they can take
[1:53:38.360 --> 1:53:42.200]  down thomas jefferson and george washington and by god they're doing it folks they're doing it
[1:53:42.200 --> 1:53:47.640]  they're trying to rewrite history erase the the mark of freedom the founders left and that's why
[1:53:47.640 --> 1:53:51.800]  we must stand firm every single day and remember calling cabernet came out against the betsy ross
[1:53:51.800 --> 1:53:56.920]  flag called it white supremacist and night pulled the shoes when betsy rocks was one of the first
[1:53:56.920 --> 1:54:03.080]  abolitionists i mean and because they don't care folks it's about the power of the megacorporations
[1:54:03.080 --> 1:54:09.480]  that run slave camps in china to sell you shoes made by slaves and tell you your flags bad because
[1:54:09.480 --> 1:54:13.640]  that flag's got a constitution bill of rights they want to get rid of i mean how dumb it'd be like
[1:54:13.640 --> 1:54:18.760]  saying your life boat in the middle of the ocean is racist so you just stab it with a knife and then
[1:54:18.760 --> 1:54:25.080]  the corporate media just goes right along with it pushing and amplifying the narrative into the
[1:54:25.080 --> 1:54:29.240]  into the masses when they're when the masses are sitting down and they're flipping through the channel
[1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:34.360]  you know you and i were watching cnn last night in my hotel room just like watching these people
[1:54:34.360 --> 1:54:38.120]  present you i yeah you were you invited me up there and it was nice we hung out but my god why
[1:54:38.120 --> 1:54:43.000]  did you have seen it on well because i'm monitoring the enemy trance no i get it exactly i get it i'm
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:47.480]  like i'm gonna i'm gonna put this on and i want to see what they're saying and what the the words
[1:54:47.480 --> 1:54:51.800]  that were coming out of their mouths i think it was a seven o'clock hour too isn't that nice yeah
[1:54:51.800 --> 1:54:57.800]  almost time slot yeah it was close time slot so they had some uh some some news anchor there but
[1:54:58.440 --> 1:55:02.760]  the point is is that the mainstream media continues to amplify these narratives brainwashing the
[1:55:02.760 --> 1:55:09.240]  american people into believing these lies and that's why we have to continue to go on info wars
[1:55:09.240 --> 1:55:16.360]  we have to continue to spread the links of all your channels my channels to the the four corners
[1:55:16.360 --> 1:55:23.000]  of the earth because everything is at stake and it's all happening right now well that's something
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:27.160]  i want to get in with you for a little bit in the next hour ahead of this special guest we've
[1:55:27.160 --> 1:55:34.440]  got joining us and that is what they're covering up right now with the quomo possible sexual
[1:55:34.440 --> 1:55:41.240]  harassment not oh a woman says he did maybe a woman said he did and so now we're all diverted off the
[1:55:41.240 --> 1:55:47.080]  giant massage cia child kidnapping rings that blackmailed and took control of the government
[1:55:47.080 --> 1:55:52.840]  we're not talking about that now no no we're talking about quomo might have harassed a woman
[1:55:52.840 --> 1:55:57.480]  that's the big giant crime and and that's how they distract oh but meanwhile they won't talk about
[1:55:57.480 --> 1:56:02.680]  galeon maximus trial they're gonna talk about quomo getting fired and then there's a memo that's
[1:56:02.680 --> 1:56:07.800]  circulating about maybe he did something okay he probably did you know let let the dust settle
[1:56:07.800 --> 1:56:13.960]  we'll throw no he hit on a woman years ago at another network oh oh my god you're not a woman
[1:56:13.960 --> 1:56:18.440]  he hit on her a lot of do that anymore but notice that's the big crime not helping your
[1:56:18.440 --> 1:56:23.640]  brother cover up over 20 000 old people they murdered that's okay murdering old people is a
[1:56:23.640 --> 1:56:27.480]  good thing just don't ask a woman out because that makes new children yeah and that's how they
[1:56:27.480 --> 1:56:34.040]  divert the story redirect brainwash the masses so that you are looking in the other direction
[1:56:34.040 --> 1:56:38.680]  but i also learned how much the media lies when i always say they lied but i mean they had daily
[1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:46.280]  mail article a few years ago literally saying that i wear swastika shoes and that and that
[1:56:46.280 --> 1:56:55.000]  and that i was asking a woman out 100 lies let me check hang on no no swastika shoes no swastika
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:57:01.240]  shoes 100 i mean just just but see they tell a lie so big gary that people go well it's gotta

[1:58:45.960 --> 1:58:51.960]  of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today half the population
[1:58:51.960 --> 1:58:57.720]  has lined up for an untested deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be
[1:58:57.720 --> 1:59:03.480]  afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease the perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their
[1:59:03.480 --> 1:59:09.240]  goal of having 80 percent of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in
[1:59:09.240 --> 1:59:14.440]  less than nine years for those of us who have awoken from the spell we know this is all really
[1:59:14.440 --> 1:59:20.760]  happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see but there is only two things to do we continue
[1:59:20.760 --> 1:59:25.880]  sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game if enough people awaken from the calm spell then we
[1:59:25.880 --> 1:59:31.960]  win but even when we win and we eventually will the days of convenience are soon coming to an end
[1:59:31.960 --> 1:59:38.840]  and so we must prepare get up to a year's worth of storable foods water filtration survival gear

[1:59:44.600 --> 2:00:05.560]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:00:05.560 --> 2:00:14.920]  we're going to get into the bottom of the rat hole or the spider hole or the
[2:00:16.040 --> 2:00:19.720]  new world order system with gary in a final segment with him
[2:00:20.440 --> 2:00:24.680]  in the longer segment coming up but but what else is on your radar because i'm just kind of
[2:00:24.680 --> 2:00:28.600]  throwing this at you i do this sometimes a guest what else is on your radar what else
[2:00:28.600 --> 2:00:34.280]  you want to impart to the audience what i think is probably the most important things you know i'm
[2:00:34.280 --> 2:00:42.440]  a father now alex i have three sons and we have to impart to our families how to we have to raise
[2:00:42.440 --> 2:00:49.160]  up our children the right way and i asked this about yesterday i asked you yesterday alex how
[2:00:49.160 --> 2:00:57.080]  do you handle the family life with children and this intensity of information that we are subject
[2:00:57.080 --> 2:01:00.920]  to now people walk around in a haze they walk around they're completely clueless to what's
[2:01:00.920 --> 2:01:07.480]  going on people like yourself myself people who are watching right now have a unique perspective
[2:01:07.480 --> 2:01:13.800]  on the world and how do we grow our children and i think that we have to measure the steps that we
[2:01:14.360 --> 2:01:21.960]  take with our children grow them up and instill the founders vision as as as flawed as a human
[2:01:21.960 --> 2:01:27.560]  that they were we have to raise up the children and instill them in the next generation that's
[2:01:27.560 --> 2:01:31.960]  the most evil fears of the bill of rights and constitution so i would just end the debate
[2:01:31.960 --> 2:01:36.200]  with the left and say okay all the more evil white people we need the right to defense we need
[2:01:36.200 --> 2:01:40.040]  the right to property we need the right to a jury all these things we have a right to our own
[2:01:40.040 --> 2:01:45.800]  bodies all these things are in an attack we this is ours now it'd be like if a racist built a castle
[2:01:46.440 --> 2:01:51.080]  and then you inherited it would you blow the castle up because your grandfather did something
[2:01:51.080 --> 2:01:58.760]  wrong no it's your castle now this is our our ship our country and that's why we have to harness the
[2:01:58.760 --> 2:02:04.360]  we have to be within the walls of our castle and we have to recognize that these castle walls
[2:02:04.360 --> 2:02:09.320]  are there for our protection the constitution is there for our protection right or wrong
[2:02:09.320 --> 2:02:13.400]  whoever put their pen down to to create those people well they were incredible people i mean
[2:02:13.400 --> 2:02:16.760]  every historian that's looked at it so they were the smartest people probably ever just they'll be
[2:02:16.760 --> 2:02:21.880]  the real key part of the renaissance they were the tail end of the first big bloom of the renaissance
[2:02:21.880 --> 2:02:25.880]  that went for 200 plus years and now we've kind of gotten decadent because the renaissance produced
[2:02:25.880 --> 2:02:29.960]  so much wealth but we're still in that renaissance and now the forces of control are trying to come
[2:02:29.960 --> 2:02:36.920]  in and get control again but i mean point blank the founders were major innovators major reformers
[2:02:36.920 --> 2:02:41.240]  that actually changed the entire world for the good and that's why neo-authoritarians
[2:02:41.240 --> 2:02:45.480]  want to shut them down and demonize them because if people take on the birthright
[2:02:45.480 --> 2:02:51.960]  of american freedom 1776 worldwide it's over for the new world order so i say i'm absolutely in
[2:02:51.960 --> 2:02:55.560]  line with our founders and admire them and they were the greatest men to ever walk the face of
[2:02:55.560 --> 2:03:02.360]  this planet and that's why we must continue to uphold the values that are in that document
[2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:07.720]  and pass those on to the next generation because if we don't you know didn't it wasn't ronald reagan
[2:03:07.720 --> 2:03:14.280]  that said that that our nation is just a generation away from being lost and what we're what we are
[2:03:14.280 --> 2:03:19.240]  seeing now through the listen kids are going into schools and they're being forced to wear
[2:03:19.240 --> 2:03:23.720]  masks there are kids who are fighting back who are getting suspended repeatedly because they're
[2:03:23.720 --> 2:03:28.920]  not going to do it imagine the psychological trauma that's happening in these children's lives just
[2:03:28.920 --> 2:03:32.120]  because they had imagined how much they're not going to trust the system i mean the founders
[2:03:32.120 --> 2:03:36.600]  really tried to empower humanity because they were in front of god and and wanted to do it and
[2:03:36.600 --> 2:03:40.920]  actually worked more freedom or everything came out of it the globalists really do want to take
[2:03:40.920 --> 2:03:45.720]  our freedom they really they're consciously bad they they want to take our freedom and that's why
[2:03:45.720 --> 2:03:51.960]  you use as you just mentioned they are continually demonizing those individuals who wrote the document
[2:03:51.960 --> 2:03:58.200]  that we hold dear to keep our freedoms so no you're right we need to we need to have a constitution
[2:03:58.200 --> 2:04:04.200]  bill of rights america celebration society it ain't just on july 4th it's under attack and
[2:04:04.200 --> 2:04:08.360]  now is the time that we but if you're gonna fly the flag and i know you do folks you've got to
[2:04:08.360 --> 2:04:12.120]  then defend freedom and speak out in the street not just at your house it's great to fly the
[2:04:12.120 --> 2:04:16.920]  american flag that's put on your car but now you you've got to really demonstrate and protest and
[2:04:16.920 --> 2:04:23.000]  call into radio shows and you know give political donations and and pray and and and not submit
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:28.040]  to tyranny because that's what's going to put power behind the red white and blue they only
[2:04:28.040 --> 2:04:36.040]  gain power when you submit it to them when you hand it to them okay that's and that's the truth
[2:04:36.040 --> 2:04:40.680]  that's the only way they gain power is when you surrender it and that's why you cannot
[2:04:40.680 --> 2:04:45.880]  you must always stand firm in your convictions for freedom so that we can preserve this nation
[2:04:45.880 --> 2:04:51.880]  that's right because i mean again everybody all america's been in free yeah it's a lot further

[2:06:06.680 --> 2:06:17.160]  very crunchy riding shotgun he's about to get in the car

[2:06:27.960 --> 2:06:31.640]  i'll tell you the blaze network and glenbeck are just doing a fabulous job
[2:06:32.200 --> 2:06:35.560]  and we're so glad to see glenbeck is fighting the new world order and fighting the poison
[2:06:35.560 --> 2:06:39.880]  shots and fighting the lockdowns and now knows it's a new world order and the fema camps are real
[2:06:40.520 --> 2:06:44.440]  and that's all i wanted was never in competition with him just wanted him to know i wasn't a liar
[2:06:44.440 --> 2:06:49.720]  and now he knows i wasn't a liar and so we're friends now and i hope glenbeck gets 10 times
[2:06:49.720 --> 2:06:54.120]  bigger than me because they're trying to put my ass in prison with the january 6th thing and i had
[2:06:54.120 --> 2:06:59.000]  talked earlier about getting your associate to pop in with us and we'll do that here in about five
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:03.960]  minutes or we can just get him up here we don't have a mobile mic to give him uh but or maybe we'll
[2:07:03.960 --> 2:07:08.600]  hold him over and do that next segment i'd want to do that earlier but he was at the january 6th
[2:07:08.600 --> 2:07:13.880]  event and actually said uh i guess i've met him many years ago in chicago with you one of your
[2:07:13.880 --> 2:07:17.800]  good friends that i actually helped him not go in the building and i'm not trying to toot my horn
[2:07:17.800 --> 2:07:23.320]  like i helped thousands not go in the building i have an mpr report here today and of several others
[2:07:23.320 --> 2:07:28.520]  the new talking point is that i was trying to lead people away from that side of the capital
[2:07:28.520 --> 2:07:33.400]  to go attack the other side and then i led the attack on the other side even though i'm there with
[2:07:33.400 --> 2:07:38.360]  the police trying to stop the other side as well i was trying to go to lot eight where i was told we
[2:07:38.360 --> 2:07:43.880]  had a stage and a permit which they did have set up so the level of deception has just reached
[2:07:43.880 --> 2:07:48.760]  incredible heights yeah he was there he was a witness i remember speaking to him after the fact
[2:07:48.760 --> 2:07:55.160]  and he told me he saw you you know telling people not to go in don't go into the building and now
[2:07:55.160 --> 2:08:00.440]  what we're seeing is these people are being swept up and arrested you know for for entering into the
[2:08:00.440 --> 2:08:05.480]  federal property uh tell us about your friend and who he is because i wanted to give him a mic but i
[2:08:05.480 --> 2:08:10.840]  guess oh he when he gets hopefully he can get up here and he can give you his first hand account
[2:08:10.840 --> 2:08:15.800]  of the day uh but his name is chad labrero and i've known chad since back in the london lantern
[2:08:15.800 --> 2:08:22.520]  society days passing out dvds uh in the streets of chicago so chad has been a lifelong activist
[2:08:22.520 --> 2:08:28.920]  working with me um on so many different levels so well you know maybe and maybe we'll be right
[2:08:28.920 --> 2:08:32.680]  next segment we'll just hold you over an extra segment because this is important and i i think
[2:08:32.680 --> 2:08:37.320]  it is i like chad and i want to be able to talk to him and maybe we can do a next segment but um
[2:08:38.920 --> 2:08:43.000]  speaking about gisling maxwell because the listeners are really calling the show
[2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:47.880]  they're emailing us the people on the street are saying hey gisling maxwell they're covering up that
[2:08:47.880 --> 2:08:55.960]  trial uh we want to hear more of this from you well i mean we're trying almost nothing's coming
[2:08:55.960 --> 2:09:01.160]  out of it and i agree we need more reporters and i would like to have an east coast reporter
[2:09:01.160 --> 2:09:05.880]  and have the funds to do that currently we don't i'm not complaining because we are having to pay
[2:09:05.880 --> 2:09:11.800]  for millions and millions of dollars of bandwidth we have millions of viewers a day on bandaw video
[2:09:11.800 --> 2:09:17.560]  millions and so we're talking thousands and thousands of dollars a day tens of thousands
[2:09:17.560 --> 2:09:23.400]  of dollars a day so our very success is our problem uh and and so we're we now have all
[2:09:23.400 --> 2:09:29.240]  these new contributors in fact i'd love to have you mirror your stuff with us uh gary on bandaw video
[2:09:29.800 --> 2:09:34.200]  and so that's why i'm telling everybody as so many folks get kicked off the regular platforms
[2:09:34.200 --> 2:09:39.160]  they come to bandaw video we're not doing ad shares we don't have advertisers on there we're
[2:09:39.160 --> 2:09:43.880]  just paying to get it on and i'm using the money that comes in off of this show so when you buy
[2:09:43.880 --> 2:09:49.800]  products from us you are literally financing all these other people being able to now have a platform
[2:09:49.800 --> 2:09:53.880]  okay and maybe down the road you know we can talk to folks and create some ad share thing
[2:09:53.880 --> 2:09:56.840]  we haven't gotten to that point we're not a billion dollar company we're not a hundred million
[2:09:56.840 --> 2:10:01.000]  dollar company we're spending millions and millions of dollars a quarter on bandwidth
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:04.680]  and infrastructure alone so thank you all for going to infowarstore.com because
[2:10:05.720 --> 2:10:10.440]  robert f. kennedy's getting censored everywhere he did an interview with us last week with one
[2:10:10.440 --> 2:10:14.840]  of our reporters he got over a million views on our platform then clips went out tens of millions
[2:10:14.840 --> 2:10:19.320]  of views so this is such an important operation and so is next news network how do folks find
[2:10:19.320 --> 2:10:25.880]  next news network well you can go to nextnewsnetwork.com you can watch us there we do have a platform
[2:10:25.880 --> 2:10:31.320]  not as robust as info wars does but we do have a way people can subscribe for ad free content
[2:10:31.320 --> 2:10:37.000]  primarily we're on youtube you can watch hey i hope it is as robust in many ways you're like i mean
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:40.120]  you're reaching billions of people on youtube i'm reaching nobody i just want to make the point you
[2:10:40.120 --> 2:10:44.760]  are robust you are kicking ass and i love it well thank you for that alice but you can watch us on
[2:10:44.760 --> 2:10:49.960]  youtube youtube.com slash next news network you can find us on rumble you can find us on
[2:10:49.960 --> 2:10:55.080]  bitshoot you can find us on odyssey you can find us on getter you can find us on all okay before
[2:10:55.080 --> 2:11:00.200]  you leave today we're giving you a login and a free membership at bandah video sounds great so
[2:11:00.200 --> 2:11:05.720]  okay because uh you're awesome but i just i really want your content on our platform i'm happy to
[2:11:05.720 --> 2:11:10.440]  figure out a way to get it there all you gotta do is just upload it to the site and and very soon
[2:11:10.440 --> 2:11:15.960]  and i've i've worked on this it's independent it's it's our own software our own deals cost us a
[2:11:15.960 --> 2:11:21.320]  quite a bit of money but we have our own mobile going live app that's crystal clear works all over
[2:11:21.320 --> 2:11:25.720]  the place that we're that we're gonna be able to basically deploy to everybody soon so i'm very excited
[2:11:25.720 --> 2:11:31.960]  about that because so many people have been lost their live streaming who haven't been censored
[2:11:31.960 --> 2:11:36.520]  and so it's important to get that out brian did you hear that you got some more work to do
[2:11:36.520 --> 2:11:42.280]  oh so what's going on with brian oh brian he's my technical producer so he handled he handles all
[2:11:42.280 --> 2:11:48.280]  the the uploading the the post-production work to get everything up up on well he's gonna come on
[2:11:48.280 --> 2:11:53.320]  next segment but let's get him with brian brian is my producer in alabama brian i could not do
[2:11:53.320 --> 2:11:57.720]  next news network if it wasn't for brian i gotta say that right now well we're gonna get brian on
[2:11:57.720 --> 2:12:02.600]  the phone with rob do today we're gonna get it done all right you hear that brian you got a phone
[2:12:02.600 --> 2:12:07.480]  called rob today all right but getting back to gisling max well here
[2:12:10.600 --> 2:12:15.640]  how do we get this out i mean i guess i guess i need to get on an airplane and go up to new york
[2:12:15.640 --> 2:12:19.160]  and i guess try to get in the courtroom and see what's happening because they're suppressing it all
[2:12:19.160 --> 2:12:22.760]  i think that they're even preventing certain people from going into the courtroom and if alex
[2:12:22.760 --> 2:12:27.880]  jones shows up in the glane max while courtroom that's gonna be a circus in its own right i can see
[2:12:27.880 --> 2:12:34.840]  it happening uh but i've been following on twitter there's an account called the i forget the name
[2:12:34.840 --> 2:12:41.000]  but it's it's the the glane max well trial tracker so i go there and i check it out and people are
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:45.320]  posting links to transcripts and you can read the transcripts and some of the stuff that is coming
[2:12:45.320 --> 2:12:51.240]  out because the transcripts have to be i believe i don't know how you request a transcript specifically
[2:12:51.240 --> 2:12:58.840]  but what i've read coming out of that trial and how she was grooming kids with um with epstein at
[2:12:58.840 --> 2:13:04.520]  the special camp that they were attending and they were being recruited to recruit other children
[2:13:04.520 --> 2:13:08.760]  yeah and they would fly to eastern europe and buy seven-year-old girls who they had then had trained
[2:13:08.760 --> 2:13:14.360]  for over a decade who were sturduses on the aircraft at 18 who were then recruiting underage girls
[2:13:14.360 --> 2:13:20.200]  it's it's amazing when you read through the transcript in the first hand account of this victim
[2:13:20.200 --> 2:13:27.400]  and how long this grooming process was these people are meticulous they are patient and they are
[2:13:27.400 --> 2:13:33.400]  twisted in order to get their end game and it's very it parallels what we're seeing across the
[2:13:33.400 --> 2:13:38.440]  spectrum with the new world order and its implementation here in america and across the world
[2:13:38.440 --> 2:13:44.280]  because they are meticulous they are patient and they are using every method that they can
[2:13:44.280 --> 2:13:49.880]  to lock down and control people's freedom and let's be clear the the federal prosecutors kept
[2:13:49.880 --> 2:13:55.240]  this to only four women who were underage at the time who were older girls not the super young ones
[2:13:55.240 --> 2:14:00.440]  that they know about and so that's why comey's daughter famously corrupt the father is running
[2:14:00.440 --> 2:14:04.680]  this and so the trial itself is very limited in scope by what they went after and then they're
[2:14:04.680 --> 2:14:10.360]  limiting that even more so it's limit upon limit upon limit well they don't want the truth to get
[2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:15.400]  out they don't want because they know that when names are going to be presented in these courtrooms
[2:14:15.400 --> 2:14:20.920]  these names are high profile people of influence i mean just some of the pictures that you've seen
[2:14:20.920 --> 2:14:30.440]  of course you've seen the picture with glane maxwell at at the clinton wedding at at the daughter
[2:14:30.440 --> 2:14:38.040]  chelsea chelsea's wedding you know super creepy these people are in every single level of power
[2:14:38.040 --> 2:14:43.000]  but some good things are happening um the f a a was supposed to release documents so so they
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  overproduced by accident which is great they were hiding 701 flights of epstein with a bunch of
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:53.960]  politicians on board wow i haven't seen it i heard about that i didn't look any further into it but
[2:14:53.960 --> 2:15:00.520]  it's an interesting element once you start to learn who was actually on those flight logs well if i
[2:15:00.520 --> 2:15:06.360]  wanted to join a prison gang i'd have to you know it's it's racial so it had to be white folks probably
[2:15:06.920 --> 2:15:10.680]  or maybe i could join a motorcycle gang like the mongols that's multiracial it couldn't really
[2:15:10.680 --> 2:15:15.240]  join the hell's angels they're white only uh release used to be but i would have to commit
[2:15:15.240 --> 2:15:19.320]  some pretty serious crimes before i actually became a member but those are crimes like killing
[2:15:19.320 --> 2:15:23.320]  somebody or robbing a bank or you know dealing a bunch of drugs or running a bunch of hookers for
[2:15:23.320 --> 2:15:28.040]  years you know you have to be a known criminal they trust uh and then you have to help them you
[2:15:28.040 --> 2:15:32.040]  know generally you'll kill some people and then cover up murders together but that's not enough
[2:15:32.040 --> 2:15:36.600]  you see with the globalists it's having sex with kids and killing kids and so that's the initiation
[2:15:36.600 --> 2:15:41.640]  so the corrupt businessmen and politicians they go knowing they're going to screw kids and and kill
[2:15:41.640 --> 2:15:47.320]  kids by the way folks uh this is part of the gang initiation and that's what i'm going to be covering
[2:15:47.320 --> 2:15:52.280]  a lot more after gary leaves and also i'm going to be on a big podcast tonight breaking it down
[2:15:52.280 --> 2:15:56.840]  as well but i'm not going to say the name of the podcast yet you'll see if you're concerned about
[2:15:56.840 --> 2:16:02.120]  the power grid let's go ahead take another call let's talk to malcolm in tennessee welcome hello
[2:16:02.120 --> 2:16:06.760]  alex yes malcolm all right i will make this quick and real short where the other patreons can get
[2:16:06.760 --> 2:16:12.600]  on the line uh alex i have to promote one thing from one of your co-host owin shroyer supermail
[2:16:12.600 --> 2:16:18.280]  volatility and brain force plus mix those two together you're an unstoppable tank supermail
[2:16:18.280 --> 2:16:23.880]  volatility really really works it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been
[2:16:23.880 --> 2:16:30.440]  heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well but
[2:16:30.440 --> 2:16:35.320]  just aren't as strong this is like a very fine wine it's it's it's in fact each batch is different
[2:16:35.320 --> 2:16:39.240]  sometimes it's super strong sometimes it's just okay people like why are you selling something and
[2:16:39.240 --> 2:16:44.920]  admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong that's just how it is it's how it works uh so it's always
[2:16:44.920 --> 2:16:49.880]  good it's just sometimes it's like super strong but yeah if you want the rolls royce at a decent
[2:16:49.880 --> 2:17:01.480]  price then this is it why do my enemies hate me so much why do the globalists take you so much
[2:17:01.480 --> 2:17:09.000]  why do they hate america so much because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:14.440]  that they're pushing cannot coexist with it's very very simple for their world government
[2:17:14.440 --> 2:17:21.000]  their anti-human post-human eugenics system to flourish freedom and liberty and new process
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:27.960]  injustice and god-fearing systems must fail so sure you didn't start a fight with bill gates
[2:17:27.960 --> 2:17:34.040]  you didn't start a fight with david rockfeller you didn't start a fight with the un they started
[2:17:34.040 --> 2:17:39.880]  a fight with you and they're not gonna back down and they're not gonna go away and they're not going
[2:17:39.880 --> 2:17:46.040]  to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of god put into them but the average person
[2:17:46.040 --> 2:17:50.680]  still doesn't even know about the new world order or about globalism or about corporate fascism
[2:17:50.680 --> 2:17:55.960]  and it's not until people understand that and that we're under attack we have any chance of beating
[2:17:55.960 --> 2:18:06.520]  these people cover commander here with an important message to humanity i have decided that all of
[2:18:06.520 --> 2:18:14.360]  you will take a special injection so that you will be safe but the injection is not ready
[2:18:15.240 --> 2:18:23.960]  and so i need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the can
[2:18:24.600 --> 2:18:31.880]  i also need you to wear masks and i also need you to only shop at mega corporations
[2:18:31.880 --> 2:18:40.360]  that way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy leaving companies the only
[2:18:40.360 --> 2:18:49.160]  i own profitable you will then be my slaves oh and then you'll get that special shot of
[2:18:49.160 --> 2:18:55.000]  fit him from copra it will remove your immune system so you'll be dependent on me for the rest

[2:20:00.840 --> 2:20:16.840]  lies of the new world order it's alex jones all right final segment with next news networks
[2:20:16.840 --> 2:20:23.800]  founder and head anchor man gary francie i'm your host alex jones and i had that investigative
[2:20:23.800 --> 2:20:27.560]  journalist whistleblower coming on but they had traffic problems in london they were going to be
[2:20:27.560 --> 2:20:32.280]  late i just said let's just do it another day very exciting very scary powerful documentary
[2:20:32.280 --> 2:20:37.320]  that david ikes coming out with uh dealing with euthanasia called a good deaths coming out soon
[2:20:37.320 --> 2:20:42.760]  that's what it was dealing with some first looks at that uh and and just to show how deep this
[2:20:42.760 --> 2:20:50.040]  rabbit hole goes gary these people were facing these evil globalists give me your perspective on
[2:20:50.040 --> 2:20:55.720]  them but those of us that love our children that love justice that don't want to hurt people i mean
[2:20:55.720 --> 2:21:00.440]  i can be a jerk i can be angry i could certainly attack somebody they attack me but i don't want
[2:21:00.440 --> 2:21:04.120]  to hurt people i don't feel jealous when my neighbor's got a beautiful wife i don't feel
[2:21:04.120 --> 2:21:08.360]  jealous when i see somebody that's got a cool helicopter uh or somebody's a great football
[2:21:08.360 --> 2:21:14.520]  player or somebody's got a great voice but then you learn about globalists and they hate everybody
[2:21:14.520 --> 2:21:20.200]  that they have a real desire to dominate and kill and hurt they're really really nasty people well
[2:21:20.200 --> 2:21:28.920]  alex what these people they believe that they are gods okay they are godless individuals and when
[2:21:28.920 --> 2:21:35.160]  you are a person that doesn't have god or jesus christ dwelling within you you are an empty soul
[2:21:35.160 --> 2:21:41.560]  an empty vessel and because they are globalists they think they sit above the globe and they control
[2:21:41.560 --> 2:21:46.360]  everybody so they have no conscious when they say that they're going to go ahead and implement all
[2:21:46.360 --> 2:21:52.360]  these different rules and mandates and things and oh so what a thousand people die that's collateral
[2:21:52.360 --> 2:21:57.320]  damage for their end game which is massive and overreaching global control i totally agree and
[2:21:57.320 --> 2:22:02.440]  the lockdowns kill the next 25 million people they admit so the un orders a lockdown instead of 15
[2:22:02.440 --> 2:22:06.840]  million starving to death 30 something million starved to death and then they just go oh it's
[2:22:06.840 --> 2:22:11.480]  no big deal was to stop covet so so i mean they know exactly what they're doing they know what
[2:22:11.480 --> 2:22:17.320]  they're doing these people are godless and that's why they can continue to operate in that capacity
[2:22:17.320 --> 2:22:23.640]  alex exactly when i do something wrong even on accident i feel guilt because i want to be good
[2:22:23.640 --> 2:22:28.600]  and i have a connection to god they love it they think it's funny no they have no they have no guilt
[2:22:28.600 --> 2:22:35.400]  they have no conscience because these people believe that they are at the apex of humanity
[2:22:35.400 --> 2:22:41.320]  that they are the ones they're on over they are so drunk on power what is that well i don't i don't
[2:22:41.320 --> 2:22:46.840]  know what that is i mean that maybe it's they're trying to fulfill that emptiness that that because
[2:22:46.840 --> 2:22:51.960]  they have no soul they are the only way that they can continue is by trying to fill it with
[2:22:51.960 --> 2:22:57.640]  controlling other people and that's how they feel connected to the world that's all that's the only
[2:22:57.640 --> 2:23:04.200]  way i can try to explain it and look how miserable look how fake bill gates and and mark zuckerberg
[2:23:04.200 --> 2:23:09.160]  look and then everything they do is just so damn evil i mean who the hell are these people well
[2:23:09.160 --> 2:23:13.480]  these people are cardboard cutouts i mean i'm looking at this video you're playing right here
[2:23:13.480 --> 2:23:18.840]  and the fake smiles and they're hanging out the these are the two people who sit at the top the
[2:23:18.840 --> 2:23:25.880]  apex of this globalism i mean microsoft facebook the social media the connectivity these people
[2:23:25.880 --> 2:23:31.160]  recognize and they know how much power that they have i mean facebook when you go on and you log
[2:23:31.160 --> 2:23:38.920]  in and you look at that news feed that news feed is specifically curated to have an intended effect
[2:23:38.920 --> 2:23:43.560]  to release the serotonin to go ahead and give you those those those happy feelings that someone
[2:23:43.560 --> 2:23:48.840]  liked your post or someone commented oh yes and it's like a it's like a ringing a bell and you're
[2:23:48.840 --> 2:23:53.080]  just coming to get your dinner and these people know exactly what they're doing and they are
[2:23:53.080 --> 2:23:57.720]  shifting and controlling society through these social media networks through these news feeds
[2:23:57.720 --> 2:24:04.440]  so that they can have an intended outcome which is absolute control and guess what they've got a
[2:24:04.440 --> 2:24:10.040]  global pandemic and they can go ahead and issue massive fear that's right it's about them turning
[2:24:10.040 --> 2:24:14.120]  us into robots it's about them having total power again reintroduce your friend chad tell us who he
[2:24:14.120 --> 2:24:17.720]  is and he's going to pop on and talk some about what he witnessed on january 6th because i'm not
[2:24:17.720 --> 2:24:22.280]  even defending myself but i listened this morning it was sent to me by a bunch of people sunday but
[2:24:22.280 --> 2:24:30.920]  i'd have time to watch it i listened to it this morning this is mpr nationally says jones cowardly
[2:24:30.920 --> 2:24:38.040]  deceived trump supporters and led them into the building and alex jones needs to go to jail
[2:24:38.040 --> 2:24:43.080]  and and the weird thing is even a couple years ago mpr reporters sounded slick these people
[2:24:43.960 --> 2:24:51.320]  sound like they're doing a fifth grade rtf class i mean they don't you know 10 year old sound better
[2:24:51.320 --> 2:24:56.360]  than them okay so so so i'm not going to play it but it's house expects to hear from roger stone
[2:24:56.360 --> 2:25:03.880]  alex jones and michael flinn by january 6 about january 6 but let's bring a chat on
[2:25:03.880 --> 2:25:10.440]  talk about what he witnessed on january 6 chad hey alex i uh told you when we were coming in it was
[2:25:10.440 --> 2:25:15.320]  uh it was a really important thing to see you there and you don't have to defend yourself i'll
[2:25:15.320 --> 2:25:20.440]  defend you i was right there when you got up on top of the trailer when you climb the chairs and you
[2:25:20.440 --> 2:25:27.240]  pretty much begged everybody to uh turn around not not turn it into a bad thing i was there with my
[2:25:27.240 --> 2:25:32.440]  young son my two-year-old son my girlfriend uh i would have never put them in danger we were on
[2:25:32.440 --> 2:25:37.080]  the outside of the ellipse when trump was speaking couldn't really hear i wasn't going to take a
[2:25:37.080 --> 2:25:43.960]  stroller into that crowd but it was a just a high energy great place to be i was excited to show up
[2:25:43.960 --> 2:25:51.480]  and be counted uh i felt it was an important moment for my kids and and my family and we
[2:25:51.480 --> 2:25:56.360]  really felt this sense of community with everybody who was out there and it was really positive and
[2:25:56.360 --> 2:26:02.760]  then i noticed as we were some of the first to move away because we couldn't hear anyway and
[2:26:02.760 --> 2:26:07.320]  my girlfriend went back with my baby to the hotel i was walking with some other friends
[2:26:07.320 --> 2:26:14.040]  we got there and i i did see people penetrate the the barrier to the capital and the police just got
[2:26:14.040 --> 2:26:18.120]  out of the way everybody kind of walked it was there was no drama there was no vandalism there
[2:26:18.120 --> 2:26:23.640]  was no violence and then things started to heat up there was the the flash bangs the smoke and
[2:26:23.640 --> 2:26:28.920]  people were getting huddled and um corralled and i could kind of tell that something was wrong
[2:26:28.920 --> 2:26:33.800]  you know people were really whipped up in a frenzy people were stirred and over the years you've
[2:26:33.800 --> 2:26:40.200]  kind of been a guide for me on this whole journey of waking up and and realizing what's
[2:26:40.200 --> 2:26:44.760]  happening in the world and and when you're angry and upset you know i might vibe on that and i
[2:26:44.760 --> 2:26:48.920]  might you know get really interested in certain topics but that day you were the voice of reason
[2:26:48.920 --> 2:26:55.880]  you were literally begging people not to go into the capital and honestly uh that was kind of a
[2:26:55.880 --> 2:26:59.400]  nice wake up for me because i was swept away in the moment like everybody else was there was a lot
[2:26:59.400 --> 2:27:04.120]  of righteous indignation in that crowd there was a lot of people who knew that we were there for
[2:27:04.680 --> 2:27:08.360]  a reason i think it was important to get the visual aerially i think a lot of us were excited
[2:27:08.360 --> 2:27:12.520]  to surround the capital i don't think anybody thought about the fact that people would go inside
[2:27:13.160 --> 2:27:18.680]  uh and and engage in violence or vandalism that's not why i was there that's not why anybody i
[2:27:18.680 --> 2:27:24.920]  know was there um and i i appreciate what you did i mean i i appreciate you just being another
[2:27:24.920 --> 2:27:29.720]  witness the point is i was not there telling people attack the capital like npr says i mean
[2:27:30.680 --> 2:27:35.400]  again it's not about me it's like the level of criminal activity by these people is insane
[2:27:35.400 --> 2:27:40.520]  i mean they're on a thousand radio stations saying i attack the capital and order people to go in
[2:27:41.400 --> 2:27:45.080]  no they're they're lying absolutely i was standing right underneath you i've still got a picture
[2:27:45.640 --> 2:27:49.400]  kind of looking up where you were because i wanted to document that moment and you know
[2:27:49.400 --> 2:27:55.240]  honestly there was a lot of people as we know stirring up the crowd the other way and uh those
[2:27:55.240 --> 2:27:59.160]  aren't people that that we've developed trust with over the years like those of us who have listened
[2:27:59.160 --> 2:28:04.760]  to you who know your work we knew you were somebody we could trust you know but there was a lot of
[2:28:04.760 --> 2:28:09.720]  people there who i had never seen before and like gary said we've been doing this a long time i
[2:28:09.720 --> 2:28:14.280]  recognized a lot of folks who were there i didn't recognize others and the people who were engaging
[2:28:14.280 --> 2:28:21.400]  in violence and trying to promote that as the uh the main thrust of that crowd you know that i i
[2:28:21.400 --> 2:28:25.320]  think we know what that was and you were doing your best to combat that and it was just a bad
[2:28:25.320 --> 2:28:29.880]  situation well chat it's great to see you again i guess 16 years ago we marched in chicago for
[2:28:29.880 --> 2:28:33.960]  911 truth and and against the war so god bless you it's good to see you and gary and next time

[2:33:03.640 --> 2:33:14.920]  jones when i grow up i want to defeat the new world order and break into the next dimension
[2:33:14.920 --> 2:33:22.680]  here we now take you live to the central texas command center in the heart of the resistance
[2:33:23.400 --> 2:33:33.640]  with chad larrow and gary frankey frankey in the italian this frankey when my family came here and
[2:33:33.640 --> 2:33:38.760]  assimilated they decided that they were going to change a pronunciation to french and that's where
[2:33:38.760 --> 2:33:46.120]  we are and i'm happy to be here absolutely so the reason i knew that is my grandfather had like
[2:33:46.120 --> 2:33:51.640]  five or six frankey shotguns and i've actually i've i've got two of them my dad's got the others
[2:33:51.640 --> 2:33:58.120]  but these are uh really old shotguns i think one of them even brought back from uh from italy because
[2:33:58.120 --> 2:34:03.160]  he was in the the army air corps in north africa but did his 22 missions by the time they went into
[2:34:03.160 --> 2:34:07.080]  italy and then he was involved i guess like one of your grandfathers and like feeding people the
[2:34:07.080 --> 2:34:11.240]  old mess hall which was his own job he said that was harder he told my dad this never told me this
[2:34:11.240 --> 2:34:19.000]  before he died he told my dad my grandfather told him it was harder uh running the the the the
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:25.720]  mess hall for the troops than it was flying a b17 and dropping bombs on germans because the
[2:34:25.720 --> 2:34:30.360]  starving children in the collapse in italy and and like literally he didn't he didn't want to
[2:34:30.360 --> 2:34:33.880]  eat himself he would like literally get all everybody to donate food because there were
[2:34:33.880 --> 2:34:38.840]  children starving to death and was the images of the collapse of civilization that really haunted
[2:34:38.840 --> 2:34:45.560]  him the worst well my grandfather grandpa franche he served in world war two he was a mess cook
[2:34:45.560 --> 2:34:50.440]  and he got promoted because the guy in front of him was going to feed the troops on the front line
[2:34:50.440 --> 2:34:54.120]  they blew up his they blew up his truck right in front of my grandfather and he said well you're
[2:34:54.120 --> 2:35:00.440]  now you're promoted my grandfather then i he told the story once about how he was feeding
[2:35:00.440 --> 2:35:05.320]  he was getting all the food ready for the troops you know making lots of spaghetti and all kinds
[2:35:05.320 --> 2:35:11.880]  of food japanese soldier naked japanese soldier come running into the tent starving to death
[2:35:11.880 --> 2:35:16.760]  and my grandfather had to kill him he had to kill him because he had there was no choice in the
[2:35:16.760 --> 2:35:22.680]  matter but that's the way that's where we that's what my grandmother exactly in the on the ground
[2:35:22.680 --> 2:35:27.800]  is the worst stuff like like you think often combat's bad imagine being in a city of a millions of
[2:35:27.800 --> 2:35:31.800]  people collapse with people starving to death begging for food with children with their ribs
[2:35:31.800 --> 2:35:38.040]  sticking out well that's where we're going to be if the situation continues to unfold with the
[2:35:38.040 --> 2:35:42.280]  supply chain crisis we're seeing empty store shelves we're seeing inflation out of control people
[2:35:42.280 --> 2:35:47.480]  out of work government checks people waiting for them what we're witnessing here is the government
[2:35:47.480 --> 2:35:54.520]  creating a dependency system of the american people so that they are subjects that we're being
[2:35:54.520 --> 2:36:00.360]  domesticated yes we're being domesticated they want us to be subjects of their rule rather than
[2:36:00.360 --> 2:36:06.040]  being independent sovereign free people let's go back to fronky shotguns i not only have the two
[2:36:06.040 --> 2:36:09.400]  from my grandfather i've got four others because there's some of the best shotguns out there better
[2:36:09.400 --> 2:36:14.760]  than beretta so you have you ever gone bird hunting with with a fronky i've never gone bird hunting
[2:36:14.760 --> 2:36:20.120]  so we should do that crazy but you gotta buy a shotgun from your family name you gotta go i will
[2:36:20.120 --> 2:36:26.520]  i do plan to do that that's on my list of things to do believe me hey let's bring back chat he seems
[2:36:26.520 --> 2:36:29.960]  like a really smart guy i mean i know i met him a few times but didn't get to know him i think we
[2:36:29.960 --> 2:36:34.120]  had a few drinks one time and that was 16 years ago it's hard to remember can you believe chat how
[2:36:34.120 --> 2:36:38.120]  crazy things have gotten seven from january six what's just you seem like a pretty smart guy what's
[2:36:38.120 --> 2:36:44.120]  your observations about the world today well i i feel like we're kind of in a a time warp since
[2:36:44.120 --> 2:36:48.760]  that first time we met uh to where we are now and you know back then i used to have to be a little
[2:36:48.760 --> 2:36:53.480]  bit bashful when i would tell people about alex jones you know it sounded crazy sounded crazy to
[2:36:53.480 --> 2:36:58.520]  my family sounded crazy to my friends gary and i kind of huddled together because we knew the truth
[2:36:58.520 --> 2:37:04.760]  or at least we we we felt like we did but there was uh you know i'm almost a nervousness to go
[2:37:04.760 --> 2:37:11.160]  outside of that that bubble in our activism um and then you know over the years you just keep
[2:37:11.160 --> 2:37:16.120]  getting more and more and more validated every time i turn around and i've had a lot of people
[2:37:16.120 --> 2:37:22.040]  apologize to me that a lot of people you know asked me for articles asked me for information
[2:37:22.040 --> 2:37:27.560]  and and you've been kind of a beacon for me and i know for gary as well like throughout this process
[2:37:28.120 --> 2:37:31.720]  i know i can depend on you to tell the truth you know whether you get everything a hundred percent
[2:37:31.720 --> 2:37:36.440]  perfect or not i know you're going to tell the truth as you know it and i i feel very confident
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:42.360]  relaying information that i get from info wars and i want to make it about alex jones or gary
[2:37:42.360 --> 2:37:48.440]  you know bronchi or anybody the whole issue is we're just a bellwether the type of support
[2:37:48.440 --> 2:37:54.280]  we're getting versus attacks and exactly 20 years ago when i was anti-war and all that stuff it was
[2:37:54.280 --> 2:37:58.840]  50 50 love hate because i was a conservative talk show host on hundreds of stations and i came out
[2:37:58.840 --> 2:38:03.640]  against the iraq war and it was like hey say about a 90 percent of your station so i certainly did
[2:38:03.640 --> 2:38:08.200]  what i thought was right we've been proven right and you know overall but the fact that now joe
[2:38:08.200 --> 2:38:12.200]  rogan was just here at the studio a few weeks ago because tenpool stayed here and was like alec jones
[2:38:12.200 --> 2:38:16.520]  is always right i didn't ask him to say that but but he knows it's not about alex jones alex jones
[2:38:16.520 --> 2:38:20.920]  is not always right i'm right most of the time the point was it's now a symbol of screw the system
[2:38:20.920 --> 2:38:26.760]  you want to destroy alex jones we're all spartacus now so i'm very honored now to basically be a symbol
[2:38:26.760 --> 2:38:31.320]  in this fight i just hope listeners realize that that's that's that's that's why they're promoting
[2:38:31.320 --> 2:38:36.600]  alex jones not because of alex jones the person well it really speaks to me that how brave you've
[2:38:36.600 --> 2:38:41.240]  been through this whole process too i mean you you know you're crashing the gate you know all the
[2:38:41.240 --> 2:38:46.440]  guns are pointed at you and i just don't see you backing off i see you getting bolder and i know that
[2:38:46.440 --> 2:38:51.640]  for you know other suburban family guys who you know aren't really sure what to do next a lot of
[2:38:51.640 --> 2:38:57.720]  times it's important to be able to look to that and to you know kind of knuckle up and and get
[2:38:57.720 --> 2:39:02.120]  ready for whatever's next because i i really don't have a good feeling about what's coming next but
[2:39:02.120 --> 2:39:08.840]  i do think that uh you know if we if we crash the gate if we really go full guns full bore you know
[2:39:08.840 --> 2:39:14.280]  we we might have a shot on the other end but we can't be silent we can't be complacent and we can't
[2:39:14.280 --> 2:39:19.400]  not get involved you know we got to get involved at every level local government you know telling
[2:39:19.400 --> 2:39:24.600]  the truth is we know it getting our neighbors and and friends to uh be passionate about things that
[2:39:24.600 --> 2:39:29.800]  matter you know they it's a it's a culture shift and it has to happen as quickly as we can make it
[2:39:29.800 --> 2:39:34.360]  gary i know you've got a podcast show and but this guy you ought to get him on there with you oh
[2:39:34.360 --> 2:39:38.680]  chad's great absolutely well chad god bless you it's good to see you again you guys got to get down
[2:39:38.680 --> 2:39:42.280]  here we'll go bird hunting next time we're deer hunting or whatever great to see you alexa be an
[2:39:42.280 --> 2:39:48.840]  honor well god bless you brother look i mean here's the thing we're under a un world government
[2:39:48.840 --> 2:39:53.320]  corporate scientific takeover they've got a whole plan for the future and they don't like the fact
[2:39:53.320 --> 2:39:57.560]  that we want our own lives and want our swimming pools and want to go to church and they just want
[2:39:57.560 --> 2:40:01.640]  all that pushed aside so this is their takeover right now and at the end of the takeover we're
[2:40:01.640 --> 2:40:06.040]  not supposed to be here so everybody can either figure this out now or roll up the red you know
[2:40:06.040 --> 2:40:13.160]  the the white flag and die but i mean it makes no sense gary because fighting backs our only chance
[2:40:13.160 --> 2:40:18.920]  there should be no discussion here either join with the globalists try to go get hired by them
[2:40:19.480 --> 2:40:25.080]  become a pedophile a devil worshiper and like submit the satan or join us because
[2:40:25.080 --> 2:40:29.720]  christ said you were hot or cold you were luke warm i spit you out of my mouth the worst place to be
[2:40:29.720 --> 2:40:35.240]  is not in either camp join satan or join christ you know i think there's a quote from george
[2:40:35.240 --> 2:40:40.440]  w bush that really just sums it up you're either with us or you're with the terrorists
[2:40:41.080 --> 2:40:49.080]  and now we have true terrorists who are operating at the global level and they are doing everything
[2:40:49.080 --> 2:40:56.760]  they can to steal our freedoms with every single excuse oh nancy polosi decides to buy a 34 million
[2:40:56.760 --> 2:41:01.960]  dollar mansion over on the coast in florida wait a second i thought the sea levels were rising i
[2:41:01.960 --> 2:41:06.120]  thought we couldn't i thought we couldn't do that why mama did it all of obama why they're giving
[2:41:06.120 --> 2:41:12.120]  loans to people with coastal property see these people are liars they are deceivers and they're
[2:41:12.120 --> 2:41:18.840]  doing everything in their power to deceive you and take your freedoms and we must have the vision
[2:41:18.840 --> 2:41:26.200]  and the discernment to step forward and out of their vision to preserve our freedom for our children
[2:41:26.200 --> 2:41:33.080]  for our grandchildren if we do not we will lose this nation and this entire planet beautifully
[2:41:33.080 --> 2:41:36.680]  said and here's the thing it's the animating contest of liberty that jefferson talked about
[2:41:37.400 --> 2:41:41.960]  this is an honor to stay in this fight that's what listeners think me i'm thanking everybody
[2:41:41.960 --> 2:41:45.640]  for keeping us in the fight keeping you in the fight that's why i see glenn beck waking up it
[2:41:45.640 --> 2:41:50.120]  makes me so happy to see him hardcore now and it's just victory and that's where just what matters
[2:41:50.120 --> 2:41:54.680]  is the spirit we need to all come together know the truth resist evil and we're all brothers and
[2:41:54.680 --> 2:42:00.520]  sisters there's no more competition there's none of the bs anymore alex when i saw that video of you

[2:42:07.160 --> 2:42:13.240]  who is this alex jones character you inspired me you put me on a track to wake up america and now
[2:42:13.240 --> 2:42:20.360]  i have been able to reach millions a billion views on youtube over a billion views and not just in
[2:42:20.360 --> 2:42:24.920]  those capacities but in all the radio and all the magazines and documentaries and work that we've
[2:42:24.920 --> 2:42:31.960]  done for all these years it's because i saw you stand up and other people need to recognize this
[2:42:31.960 --> 2:42:36.840]  and now but that's the people you've inspired so many too that the whole point is it's a it's a
[2:42:36.840 --> 2:42:42.120]  snowball then the next leader maybe black maybe brown maybe white maybe male female whatever
[2:42:42.120 --> 2:42:47.560]  you're watching right now take action it's not just what it's not even where you go in the fight

[2:43:55.640 --> 2:44:01.960]  the globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and
[2:44:01.960 --> 2:44:06.920]  chemicals added to the food it's all come out and they're doing that not because we're weak but
[2:44:06.920 --> 2:44:13.160]  because we're made the image of god the creator and we are powerful and the social engineers
[2:44:13.160 --> 2:44:18.520]  fear that so much so that's why i repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first
[2:44:18.520 --> 2:44:27.480]  came up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was
[2:44:27.480 --> 2:44:31.880]  hopeless they need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their
[2:44:31.880 --> 2:44:39.000]  cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:43.720]  of this world who is a loser and that's why it's so important that everybody keep m4war's in the
[2:44:43.720 --> 2:44:48.760]  air now more than ever because even you don't believe in god what the globalists are manifesting
[2:44:48.760 --> 2:44:53.880]  and setting up is satanic and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast

[2:45:47.880 --> 2:45:58.760]  or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones special I am a worldly person meaning I like going
[2:45:58.760 --> 2:46:04.600]  to ball games I like going to concerts I like going to play golf I like going out to dinner I like
[2:46:04.600 --> 2:46:11.000]  the metropolitan life I like everything that comes with this but see I have the survival instinct
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:16.840]  that is to get the hell out of democrat run cities get the hell out of major metropolitan areas
[2:46:16.840 --> 2:46:21.880]  because unless we change course soon it's all crashing down is it time to just move out to the
[2:46:21.880 --> 2:46:26.200]  woods just time to go get a piece of property in the woods just get off grid just get the emergency
[2:46:26.200 --> 2:46:30.760]  food supplies just live off the land that's the survival instinct but see the worldly part of me
[2:46:30.760 --> 2:46:36.040]  that still probably the majority part of me says no no no no stay in the city the survival instinct
[2:46:36.040 --> 2:46:40.040]  says get the hell out of anywhere there ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask
[2:46:40.040 --> 2:46:45.880]  that's the that's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing
[2:46:45.880 --> 2:46:51.640]  as well but you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies and so we
[2:46:51.640 --> 2:47:02.280]  have the best ones at info wars store dot com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[2:47:02.280 --> 2:47:04.520]  order it's alex jones
[2:47:04.520 --> 2:47:12.520]  you

[2:48:05.080 --> 2:48:10.280]  thought it would now they're coming after our children that means we've got to stop them or
[2:48:10.280 --> 2:48:17.800]  it's on us and that's why i'm on trump that's why i'm on senator paul and others that know damn well
[2:48:17.800 --> 2:48:22.520]  they got lied to now this vaccine is deadly poison it's not a vaccine and it's causing
[2:48:22.520 --> 2:48:29.240]  massive side effects and heart attacks and erasing people's immune systems and doesn't work just like
[2:48:29.240 --> 2:48:35.240]  the ben garrison cartoonal last week there's this big giant fat elephant in the room and foutsy the

[2:51:13.880 --> 2:51:17.640]  independent operations that are fighting them and i'm going to warn everybody and i'm going to take
[2:51:17.640 --> 2:51:22.520]  control legally and lawfully local governments and then they're still going to come with the military
[2:51:22.520 --> 2:51:26.680]  that they have purged so the military that have signed on and they're still going to have their
[2:51:26.680 --> 2:51:29.560]  narratives they're still going to stage terror attacks to blame us on it they're still going to
[2:51:29.560 --> 2:51:33.800]  try to put me in prison before the midterms because they don't want us on air to fight them
[2:51:33.800 --> 2:51:39.800]  politically but that's okay folks that's what life's all about is signing up for the truth
[2:51:39.800 --> 2:51:44.920]  and saying well i'm here i'm going to do this i'm not going to just say i'm against their pedophilia
[2:51:44.920 --> 2:51:49.160]  i'm not going to just say i'm against their devil worship i'm not just going to say i'm against
[2:51:49.160 --> 2:51:56.200]  their new world order i'm going to go ahead and just decide to stand and then you realize if i
[2:51:56.200 --> 2:52:03.240]  would have bowed down to them they'd have gotten me even quicker i mean these guys aren't giving
[2:52:03.240 --> 2:52:09.880]  anybody any quarter if you don't know what that means it's a medieval term in chivalry where
[2:52:09.880 --> 2:52:13.000]  they'd start a battle and they'd say are you going to give quarter or are we going to give quarter
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:19.720]  and that means if you start getting around it and killed and defeated if quarter is asked for
[2:52:20.920 --> 2:52:24.200]  then you don't murder the injured troops you let them you let them escape
[2:52:26.520 --> 2:52:31.640]  but if quarter is not given none quarter given none taken it means a fight to the death and
[2:52:31.640 --> 2:52:37.400]  they're not giving us quarter you understand that right like you think i want a death battle
[2:52:37.400 --> 2:52:41.640]  with these people you think i want to take on the most satanic devil worshiping child rapist
[2:52:41.640 --> 2:52:49.640]  murderers you think i like that no i'm like walking around the woods with a gun and i like
[2:52:49.640 --> 2:52:54.840]  barbecue and beef and i like hiking around and listening to rock and roll music and having fun
[2:52:54.840 --> 2:52:58.440]  but you know what i don't get to do that because these people are coming after children
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:04.440]  and if i don't stand up against them it's on me and i'm not going to sit here and have it on me
[2:53:04.440 --> 2:53:11.800]  uh i'm not committing these crimes with these people i'm not a necessary to what they've done
[2:53:11.800 --> 2:53:15.080]  so every moment i'm thinking about how to beat them every moment i'm thinking about
[2:53:15.080 --> 2:53:20.840]  how i don't play their game and and i can see all what they're going to do ladies and gentlemen you

[2:59:04.120 --> 2:59:10.760]  but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset and that's why
[2:59:10.760 --> 2:59:15.640]  it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the
[2:59:15.640 --> 2:59:20.280]  show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth so we've got an information
[2:59:20.280 --> 2:59:24.680]  warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda we've also got to get personally prepared and

[3:00:01.160 --> 3:00:13.240]  no
[3:00:31.160 --> 3:00:38.800]  So there's the voice of an angel, he's heard an angel earlier from the Dallas Seer from
[3:00:38.800 --> 3:00:45.280]  the devil, the dictator of the prime minister of New Zealand, the global estate agent, smiling
[3:00:45.280 --> 3:00:51.120]  and snickering and laughing about, oh the vaccines are permanent, sorry you never get
[3:00:51.120 --> 3:00:57.480]  out of this, like a demon just smiling and enjoying, you can just see her leaning over
[3:00:57.480 --> 3:01:01.920]  us, chained up in a stretcher, she's just, we're like chained up in a torture chair,
[3:01:01.920 --> 3:01:08.960]  oh yeah, I mean, thank God people actually aren't conscious, because if you're conscious
[3:01:08.960 --> 3:01:13.280]  looking at this, this is the same little satanic thing you can imagine, let me just be serious
[3:01:13.280 --> 3:01:19.160]  here, I can tell you that woman's a blood drinker, I can tell you what you're about
[3:01:19.160 --> 3:01:23.720]  to see is a devil worshiper of the highest order, go ahead and play her, here she is.
[3:01:23.720 --> 3:01:30.840]  There's been a huge focus on making sure that we are reaching everyone, wherever they are
[3:01:30.840 --> 3:01:36.160]  in the country, and ensuring that we're overcoming those barriers, but in my mind so long as
[3:01:36.160 --> 3:01:42.880]  You see her bearing her teeth, I tell you, but conscious of reaching them wherever they
[3:01:42.880 --> 3:01:49.960]  are, but it's a woman, so we're trained to think a woman's loving and gives us milk
[3:01:49.960 --> 3:01:53.720]  and takes care of us, because women are amazing creatures, women produce like one percent of
[3:01:53.720 --> 3:01:59.840]  violent crime, that's why they recruit women that are that one percent, they'll find you
[3:01:59.840 --> 3:02:07.320]  wherever you are, wherever you are, this is forever, no, you're going to your own dimension
[3:02:07.320 --> 3:02:15.520]  forever you monster, damn you to hell in the name of Jesus Christ, so when you know who
[3:02:15.520 --> 3:02:20.320]  these people are, it's so hard to watch, every person's like, oh it's some weird, you know,
[3:02:20.320 --> 3:02:24.320]  anorexically giving me orders, no, she's a freaking demon, look how she's looking at
[3:02:24.320 --> 3:02:33.720]  you like all like this, look, wherever you are, wherever you are, you will get to your
[3:02:33.720 --> 3:02:38.360]  mother sucks cocks in hell, that's what she is man, Linda Blair, roller, roller, here
[3:02:38.360 --> 3:02:39.360]  she is.
[3:02:39.360 --> 3:02:43.480]  People who are eligible who haven't been vaccinated, we've got work to do, you know, I don't think
[3:02:43.480 --> 3:02:48.000]  I'll ever be satisfied so long as there's someone who's choose, you know, who is eligible
[3:02:48.000 --> 3:02:51.600]  and hasn't been, and that's where it's, it's not going to be, it's not over guys, I want
[3:02:51.600 --> 3:02:59.080]  it from the start, I want them to hear that, wherever you are, wherever you are, this doesn't
[3:02:59.080 --> 3:03:04.920]  end, this isn't going to be over, wherever you are, we're putting this in, go ahead,
[3:03:04.920 --> 3:03:05.920]  there she is.
[3:03:05.920 --> 3:03:12.320]  There's been a huge focus on making sure that we are reaching everyone, wherever they are
[3:03:12.320 --> 3:03:17.680]  in the country, and ensuring that we're overcoming those barriers, but in my mind, so long as
[3:03:17.680 --> 3:03:21.280]  there's people who are eligible who haven't been vaccinated, we've got work to do, you
[3:03:21.280 --> 3:03:24.520]  know, I don't think I'll ever be satisfied so long as there's someone who's choose,
[3:03:24.520 --> 3:03:28.280]  you know, who, who is eligible and hasn't been, and that's where I've said this, there's
[3:03:28.280 --> 3:03:31.760]  not going to be an end point to this vaccination program.
[3:03:31.760 --> 3:03:37.200]  Once we've obviously rolling up, back it up 10 seconds, there's not going to be an end
[3:03:37.200 --> 3:03:38.200]  point.
[3:03:38.200 --> 3:03:40.960]  Well, that's been there my new podcast, there's not going to be an end point.
[3:03:40.960 --> 3:03:44.240]  I mean, we always told you there wouldn't be an end point, they've announced it in the
[3:03:44.240 --> 3:03:49.840]  United States this week, they've announced it in Europe, the United Kingdom, Airstrip
[3:03:49.840 --> 3:03:58.200]  one, they've announced it in Canada here, there's not going to be an end point.
[3:03:58.200 --> 3:04:03.560]  In your power grab, finish up with the wish.
[3:04:03.560 --> 3:04:10.400]  So long as there's someone who's choose, you know, who is eligible and hasn't been,
[3:04:10.400 --> 3:04:13.200]  and that's where I've said this, there's not going to be an end point to this vaccination
[3:04:13.200 --> 3:04:14.920]  program.
[3:04:14.920 --> 3:04:22.520]  Once we've obviously, we're rolling up, there's going to be an end point just like 1945, sweetheart.
[3:04:22.520 --> 3:04:26.640]  There'll always an end point to people like you, you just, you can, you can set your watch
[3:04:26.640 --> 3:04:31.320]  in warrant, and your bottom dollar by the fact that if it's the last thing I do, you
[3:04:31.320 --> 3:04:38.720]  miserable maggot, is we're going to beat you, you murderer, God, you will burn in hell.
[3:04:38.720 --> 3:04:45.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the great Gerald Salente takes over in T minus 60 seconds.
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:47.160]  Did you share free world news.tv?
[3:04:47.160 --> 3:04:48.600]  Did you share info wars.com?
[3:04:48.600 --> 3:04:50.280]  Did you share me another video?
[3:04:50.280 --> 3:04:51.840]  If you didn't, that's fine.
[3:04:51.840 --> 3:04:52.840]  Just join Satan.
[3:04:52.840 --> 3:04:53.840]  We'll be right back.
[3:04:53.840 --> 3:04:54.840]  2021.
[3:04:54.840 --> 3:04:55.840]  What are champions made of?
[3:04:55.840 --> 3:04:56.840]  Here's a man who can show you.
[3:04:56.840 --> 3:05:13.200]  Triple 8 25 33 189 has the info warsaw hotline.
[3:05:13.200 --> 3:05:26.640]  Triple 8 25 33 189 is the info warsaw hotline.
[3:05:56.640 --> 3:06:14.600]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:06:14.600 --> 3:06:19.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Salente.
[3:06:19.880 --> 3:06:24.720]  Hey, hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[3:06:24.720 --> 3:06:27.160]  Thank you so much for having me.
[3:06:27.160 --> 3:06:31.960]  I appreciate everything that Alex Jones and the team do.
[3:06:31.960 --> 3:06:36.280]  And everybody listening, do all you can to support Info
[3:06:36.280 --> 3:06:40.320]  was, we're in the fight for our lives.
[3:06:40.320 --> 3:06:43.440]  Alex just played that tape of that moron
[3:06:43.440 --> 3:06:48.320]  playing the premiere of Netherland, of New Zealand.
[3:06:48.320 --> 3:06:51.120]  I was brought down, by the way, to the New Zealand
[3:06:51.120 --> 3:06:54.000]  back in, I think, about 2006.
[3:06:54.000 --> 3:06:57.240]  They brought me there for about almost three weeks.
[3:06:57.240 --> 3:06:59.360]  And the government brought me there
[3:06:59.360 --> 3:07:05.520]  to discuss how they could increase their exports.
[3:07:05.520 --> 3:07:09.800]  And it was very profitable for both myself and them.
[3:07:09.800 --> 3:07:14.120]  So I was there, I was right at the top in the government.
[3:07:14.120 --> 3:07:19.680]  And the vibe is that it's a flat vibe in the joint.
[3:07:19.680 --> 3:07:23.600]  It's a nice place to visit, very nice people, but it's flat.
[3:07:23.600 --> 3:07:24.480]  And dead.
[3:07:24.480 --> 3:07:27.120]  And you can see why.
[3:07:27.120 --> 3:07:29.720]  And that's far from there is Australia,
[3:07:29.720 --> 3:07:33.080]  the same kind of maniacal leadership.
[3:07:33.080 --> 3:07:35.320]  And it's global.
[3:07:35.320 --> 3:07:39.560]  Here in New York, we got Warren Wilhelm Jr.
[3:07:39.560 --> 3:07:43.880]  Little arrogant, nobody of a clown, piece of garbage,
[3:07:43.880 --> 3:07:48.240]  scum crap, who changed his name to de Blasio
[3:07:48.240 --> 3:07:50.280]  so he could get the Italian-American votes.
[3:07:50.280 --> 3:07:55.200]  Yeah, the mayor that's going out an arrogant little piece
[3:07:55.200 --> 3:08:00.200]  of nothing, an arrogant zero piece of garbage
[3:08:00.200 --> 3:08:02.880]  who never worked a day in his life,
[3:08:02.880 --> 3:08:07.280]  been sucking off the public tit his entire life,
[3:08:07.280 --> 3:08:10.480]  like so many of the politicians and bureau
[3:08:10.480 --> 3:08:12.360]  craps out there.
[3:08:12.360 --> 3:08:17.160]  Today, New York City imposes vaccine mandate
[3:08:17.160 --> 3:08:20.000]  for all private sector employees.
[3:08:20.000 --> 3:08:24.560]  Look at that arrogant piece of scum crap
[3:08:24.560 --> 3:08:26.360]  I would call to his face.
[3:08:26.360 --> 3:08:31.120]  And, Junior, you want to enforce a vaccine mandate on me?
[3:08:31.120 --> 3:08:35.320]  Come over here and try it, man to man.
[3:08:35.320 --> 3:08:36.600]  But you know why you never do it?
[3:08:36.600 --> 3:08:38.320]  Because you're not a man.
[3:08:38.320 --> 3:08:43.720]  You're Warren Wilhelm Jr. and Heil Warren, Heil Wilhelm.
[3:08:43.720 --> 3:08:47.400]  Now in New York, you must be vaccinated.
[3:08:47.400 --> 3:08:48.880]  That's right.
[3:08:48.880 --> 3:08:49.760]  That's right.
[3:08:49.760 --> 3:08:52.440]  Telling employees, private employees,
[3:08:52.440 --> 3:08:55.440]  this low-life piece of scum that they
[3:08:55.440 --> 3:08:57.040]  have to get vaccinated.
[3:08:57.040 --> 3:08:59.800]  Where are the people fighting back?
[3:08:59.800 --> 3:09:02.880]  Why aren't the streets filled with the people saying,
[3:09:02.880 --> 3:09:06.080]  who is this piece of scum to tell me
[3:09:06.080 --> 3:09:10.280]  that my constitutional rights can be abridged
[3:09:10.280 --> 3:09:13.880]  by a little more on nothing?
[3:09:13.880 --> 3:09:17.920]  And it's happening around the world.
[3:09:17.920 --> 3:09:24.360]  The mandate will go into effect on December 27th.
[3:09:24.360 --> 3:09:32.040]  Hey, a fat boy, how come not December 28th?
[3:09:32.040 --> 3:09:35.280]  Why, I say it should be December 26th.
[3:09:35.280 --> 3:09:37.240]  No, no, so empty.
[3:09:37.240 --> 3:09:39.000]  I'm in charge.
[3:09:39.000 --> 3:09:44.400]  I'm Warren Wilhelm Jr. Heil Warren, Heil Warren.
[3:09:44.400 --> 3:09:47.000]  We will make it to 27th.
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:48.640]  You're making up the date.
[3:09:48.640 --> 3:09:50.960]  Yeah, we're making up the date like we make up
[3:09:50.960 --> 3:09:52.160]  all the other crap.
[3:09:52.160 --> 3:09:53.920]  You've got to be three feet apart.
[3:09:53.920 --> 3:09:55.040]  No, no, no, no.
[3:09:55.040 --> 3:09:56.720]  You've got to be six feet apart.
[3:09:56.720 --> 3:09:59.480]  No, you've got to put a piece of plexiglass around.
[3:09:59.480 --> 3:10:01.560]  No, you've got to wear one of these masks
[3:10:01.560 --> 3:10:03.600]  so you can shove up your, you know what,
[3:10:03.600 --> 3:10:05.720]  that are totally useless.
[3:10:05.720 --> 3:10:11.480]  Yeah, these masks, toxins found in disposable plastic face
[3:10:11.480 --> 3:10:15.240]  masks may harm humans and the environment.
[3:10:15.240 --> 3:10:19.800]  What kind of conspiracy theory said this?
[3:10:19.800 --> 3:10:22.880]  Since the pandemic, the demand for disposable plastic face
[3:10:22.880 --> 3:10:25.600]  masks, DPFs, has soared.
[3:10:25.600 --> 3:10:29.000]  In 2020, production facilities, mainly in China,
[3:10:29.000 --> 3:10:36.360]  produced over 52 billion masks, so 450 million per day.
[3:10:36.360 --> 3:10:38.240]  Although they are single use items,
[3:10:38.240 --> 3:10:42.120]  estimates show it could take up to 450 years
[3:10:42.120 --> 3:10:44.960]  for these face masks to degrade.
[3:10:44.960 --> 3:10:46.960]  Making matters worse, a recent study
[3:10:46.960 --> 3:10:50.720]  finds these masks may be spreading harmful toxins
[3:10:50.720 --> 3:10:53.400]  into the environment.
[3:10:53.400 --> 3:11:00.120]  And this is researches at Swansea University,
[3:11:00.120 --> 3:11:02.000]  found significant amounts of toxins led
[3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:08.160]  copper and antimony, causing coming out of several masks
[3:11:08.160 --> 3:11:09.640]  after exposure to water.
[3:11:09.640 --> 3:11:12.000]  So now, think about it.
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:16.080]  You're breathing this crap in, that's great for you.
[3:11:16.080 --> 3:11:18.720]  Anyway, going back to Warren Riddleman, Jr.
[3:11:18.720 --> 3:11:21.800]  Hi, Warren.
[3:11:21.800 --> 3:11:25.080]  The city will also require, ready for this,
[3:11:25.080 --> 3:11:29.720]  proof of vaccination for children five to 11 years old
[3:11:29.720 --> 3:11:32.760]  for indoor dining, entertainment, and fitness
[3:11:32.760 --> 3:11:33.880]  establishment.
[3:11:33.880 --> 3:11:41.520]  The mayor said, the mayor, the mayor, that's profanity.
[3:11:41.520 --> 3:11:45.840]  These people are pieces of scum, the mayor.
[3:11:45.840 --> 3:11:46.840]  Hey, I'm the mayor.
[3:11:46.840 --> 3:11:48.760]  I'll tell you what to do.
[3:11:48.760 --> 3:11:51.160]  I'm the mayor.
[3:11:51.160 --> 3:11:53.840]  Hey, you're a public servant.
[3:11:53.840 --> 3:11:56.520]  You ever hear that word before?
[3:11:56.520 --> 3:11:57.000]  Willow?
[3:11:59.960 --> 3:12:01.000]  You ready?
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:05.840]  New York State has identified eight cases
[3:12:05.840 --> 3:12:12.880]  of the moronic crumb variant as of the weekend,
[3:12:12.880 --> 3:12:14.840]  seven in New York City.
[3:12:14.840 --> 3:12:18.720]  Cases, cases.
[3:12:18.720 --> 3:12:20.880]  Read your trends journal, and you probably
[3:12:20.880 --> 3:12:23.640]  heard it on InfoWars, according to the African Health
[3:12:23.640 --> 3:12:29.200]  Ministry, where they first detected the virus.
[3:12:32.480 --> 3:12:34.400]  It's unclear whether the Omicron causes
[3:12:34.400 --> 3:12:37.680]  more severe dangers, but according to the World Health
[3:12:37.680 --> 3:12:41.000]  Organization, the people who have tested positive
[3:12:41.000 --> 3:12:46.320]  for the moronic crumb in the US so far have shown mild
[3:12:46.320 --> 3:12:48.200]  to moderate symptoms.
[3:12:48.200 --> 3:12:51.400]  And that's what they've been saying since it first came out.
[3:12:51.400 --> 3:12:53.720]  Cases, cases.
[3:12:53.720 --> 3:12:56.400]  Oh, you've got 19 and a half million people,
[3:12:56.400 --> 3:13:00.640]  and you're telling me you got eight cases?
[3:13:00.640 --> 3:13:02.680]  Look at this.
[3:13:02.680 --> 3:13:06.120]  These are the people that are running and ruining our lives
[3:13:06.120 --> 3:13:10.720]  like the clown that Alex was showing from New Zealand.
[3:13:10.720 --> 3:13:17.720]  And you got that little Danny Andrews over there in Australia?
[3:13:17.720 --> 3:13:18.520]  Yeah.
[3:13:18.520 --> 3:13:21.160]  Provide immunity, huh?
[3:13:21.160 --> 3:13:23.600]  No, they don't.
[3:13:23.600 --> 3:13:25.400]  They provide nothing.
[3:13:25.400 --> 3:13:26.080]  Read the box.
[3:13:26.080 --> 3:13:27.040]  I got the box right here.
[3:13:27.040 --> 3:13:27.760]  Let me get the box.
[3:13:27.760 --> 3:13:29.760]  Look, here's the box.
[3:13:29.760 --> 3:13:30.360]  Here it is.
[3:13:30.360 --> 3:13:31.480]  Here's the box.
[3:13:31.480 --> 3:13:33.200]  The box of crap.
[3:13:33.200 --> 3:13:34.400]  A box of stupidity.
[3:13:38.600 --> 3:13:41.800]  These masks do not eliminate exposure
[3:13:41.800 --> 3:13:46.120]  to the risk of any disease or infection.
[3:13:46.120 --> 3:13:47.400]  Yeah, let us check.
[3:13:47.400 --> 3:13:51.280]  Look at the imbeciles that people are taking orders from.
[3:13:51.280 --> 3:13:54.360]  Could you imagine this guy coming to Alex, me,
[3:13:54.360 --> 3:13:57.080]  and he is staffed over there and telling him what to do?
[3:13:57.080 --> 3:13:59.960]  Get the hell out of here, you piece of garbage.
[3:13:59.960 --> 3:14:01.280]  Oh, no, no.
[3:14:01.280 --> 3:14:03.160]  Get little Danny Andrews.
[3:14:03.160 --> 3:14:05.440]  I'm a little nobody.
[3:14:05.440 --> 3:14:06.200]  And that's what we have.
[3:14:06.200 --> 3:14:09.520]  Nobody's telling us everything that we should do.
[3:14:09.520 --> 3:14:11.840]  Again, New York City now, I'm going back to this
[3:14:11.840 --> 3:14:14.040]  because of the markets.
[3:14:14.040 --> 3:14:18.920]  The Dow is up now, before I came on there, about 650 points.
[3:14:18.920 --> 3:14:38.600]  650 points, how could the Dow go up
[3:14:38.600 --> 3:14:41.800]  when they're locking down much of the world?
[3:14:41.800 --> 3:14:46.120]  How can they do it?
[3:14:46.120 --> 3:14:51.800]  Business is going down the toilet.
[3:14:51.800 --> 3:14:55.120]  Look at the hospitality sector.
[3:14:55.120 --> 3:15:00.480]  Take a look at the office occupancy rate in New York City,
[3:15:00.480 --> 3:15:04.280]  in San Francisco, it's about 28%.
[3:15:04.280 --> 3:15:12.360]  How could the markets be going up like this when they're locking
[3:15:12.360 --> 3:15:15.760]  down places around the world?
[3:15:15.760 --> 3:15:23.640]  No vaccine, no freedom, airlines, nearly 100 establishments
[3:15:23.640 --> 3:15:29.560]  that temporarily shut down due to the pandemic and now out
[3:15:29.560 --> 3:15:30.560]  of business.
[3:15:30.560 --> 3:15:34.640]  All right, there you got it.
[3:15:34.640 --> 3:15:36.760]  It's a criminal game.
[3:15:36.760 --> 3:15:39.560]  We're going to tell you what's going to happen next.
[3:15:39.560 --> 3:15:41.200]  So make sure you stay tuned.
[3:15:41.200 --> 3:15:44.400]  And remember, put your money where your hot mind is
[3:15:44.400 --> 3:15:48.160]  supported for, was buy those great products.
[3:15:48.160 --> 3:15:50.760]  You need them now more than ever.
[3:15:50.760 --> 3:15:52.280]  What if you could?
[3:15:52.280 --> 3:15:56.840]  There is very little contemporary study in the world.
[3:15:56.840 --> 3:16:01.480]  Very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's
[3:16:01.480 --> 3:16:06.120]  ruling class, not in communist China, not in Mexico, not
[3:16:06.120 --> 3:16:08.560]  in the United States, not anywhere.
[3:16:08.560 --> 3:16:12.080]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[3:16:12.080 --> 3:16:13.960]  And that's done by design.
[3:16:13.960 --> 3:16:16.880]  The large central banks that basically control the planet
[3:16:16.880 --> 3:16:20.840]  will penalize and target any academics that look into,
[3:16:20.840 --> 3:16:23.560]  say, the Anglo-American establishment, the founder
[3:16:23.560 --> 3:16:25.320]  of the Bilderberg Group, the Trilateral Commission,
[3:16:25.320 --> 3:16:28.360]  the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds
[3:16:28.360 --> 3:16:30.200]  and the Rockefellers.
[3:16:30.200 --> 3:16:33.240]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the controlled corporate
[3:16:33.240 --> 3:16:36.000]  media of the Bilderberg Group didn't exist.
[3:16:36.000 --> 3:16:39.320]  Well, now the Bilderberg Group is public, its former head,
[3:16:39.320 --> 3:16:42.160]  still on the steering committee, is called Schwab.
[3:16:42.160 --> 3:16:44.960]  And he has set up the great reset in global government.
[3:16:44.960 --> 3:16:47.400]  And if, as a liberty movement worldwide,
[3:16:47.400 --> 3:16:50.280]  we don't address the globalist head-on about the second
[3:16:50.280 --> 3:16:53.040]  figure of worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover,
[3:16:53.040 --> 3:16:53.920]  we don't have a shot.
[3:16:53.920 --> 3:16:55.880]  Can you expose them? We can beat them easily.
[3:16:55.880 --> 3:16:57.200]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[3:16:57.200 --> 3:16:59.200]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[3:16:59.200 --> 3:16:59.680]  Welcome.
[3:16:59.680 --> 3:17:00.360]  Hello, Alex.
[3:17:00.360 --> 3:17:00.960]  Yes, Malcolm.
[3:17:00.960 --> 3:17:03.360]  All right, I will make this quick and real short
[3:17:03.360 --> 3:17:05.320]  where the other patriots can get on the line.
[3:17:05.320 --> 3:17:07.880]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one
[3:17:07.880 --> 3:17:09.760]  of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer.
[3:17:09.760 --> 3:17:12.800]  Supermail vitality and brain force plus.
[3:17:12.800 --> 3:17:14.120]  Mix those two together.
[3:17:14.120 --> 3:17:15.680]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[3:17:15.680 --> 3:17:17.480]  Supermail vitality really, really works.
[3:17:17.480 --> 3:17:20.720]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[3:17:20.720 --> 3:17:22.360]  that have never been heated up.
[3:17:22.360 --> 3:17:25.520]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared
[3:17:25.520 --> 3:17:28.080]  to powdered versions that also work quite well
[3:17:28.080 --> 3:17:29.160]  that just aren't as strong.
[3:17:29.160 --> 3:17:31.800]  This is like a very fine wine.
[3:17:31.800 --> 3:17:33.040]  In fact, each batch is different.
[3:17:33.040 --> 3:17:34.320]  Sometimes it's super strong.
[3:17:34.320 --> 3:17:35.520]  Sometimes it's just OK.
[3:17:35.520 --> 3:17:36.920]  People are like, why are you selling something
[3:17:36.920 --> 3:17:38.840]  and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[3:17:38.840 --> 3:17:39.760]  That's just how it is.
[3:17:39.760 --> 3:17:41.320]  It's how it works.
[3:17:41.320 --> 3:17:43.040]  So it's always good.
[3:17:43.040 --> 3:17:45.160]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[3:17:45.160 --> 3:17:48.200]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price,
[3:17:48.200 --> 3:17:49.080]  then this is it.
[3:17:49.080 --> 3:17:58.120]  Unrun contact tracers aren't coming.
[3:17:58.120 --> 3:18:00.960]  They're here all over the world from Australia
[3:18:00.960 --> 3:18:03.360]  to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[3:18:03.360 --> 3:18:05.960]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere
[3:18:05.960 --> 3:18:07.440]  you go and then coming to your house
[3:18:07.440 --> 3:18:09.600]  and threatening in some cases, actually,
[3:18:09.600 --> 3:18:13.760]  taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[3:18:13.760 --> 3:18:15.400]  And they're planning in the next year
[3:18:15.400 --> 3:18:18.520]  to expand their shield process where they come and take,
[3:18:18.520 --> 3:18:20.600]  quote, healthy people away and put them
[3:18:20.600 --> 3:18:22.400]  in facilities for their safety.
[3:18:22.400 --> 3:18:24.160]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[3:18:24.160 --> 3:18:26.040]  And one big thing you can do to fight back
[3:18:26.040 --> 3:18:28.840]  is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which
[3:18:28.840 --> 3:18:31.240]  are made here in America and are very compliant,
[3:18:31.240 --> 3:18:35.360]  meaning US government military grade at infowarstore.com.
[3:18:35.360 --> 3:18:37.640]  We have the entire line of silent pocket
[3:18:37.640 --> 3:18:41.080]  ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com.
[3:18:41.080 --> 3:18:42.880]  Again, we have big backpacks.
[3:18:42.880 --> 3:18:44.440]  We have special dry bags.
[3:18:44.440 --> 3:18:45.680]  We've got them for cell phones.
[3:18:45.680 --> 3:18:47.360]  We've got them for laptops.
[3:18:47.360 --> 3:18:48.240]  We've got them for iPads.
[3:18:48.240 --> 3:18:50.800]  It's all there at infowarstore.com.
[3:18:50.800 --> 3:18:54.120]  So protect your privacy today and support the infowar
[3:18:54.120 --> 3:18:56.280]  at infowarstore.com.
[3:18:56.280 --> 3:18:58.720]  So when I first started taking survival shield,
[3:18:58.720 --> 3:19:00.560]  basically I was 275 pounds.
[3:19:00.560 --> 3:19:01.280]  I was overweight.
[3:19:01.280 --> 3:19:03.640]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[3:19:03.640 --> 3:19:05.520]  I was barely holding onto a jaw.
[3:19:05.520 --> 3:19:08.080]  And I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[3:19:08.080 --> 3:19:10.680]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield,
[3:19:10.680 --> 3:19:11.320]  the X1.
[3:19:11.320 --> 3:19:12.600]  And it worked pretty good.
[3:19:12.600 --> 3:19:14.720]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that.
[3:19:14.720 --> 3:19:16.800]  You had, you know, with a deep-burdened source, you know,
[3:19:16.800 --> 3:19:18.640]  and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[3:19:18.640 --> 3:19:21.840]  And then in two weeks, I went from brain fog
[3:19:21.840 --> 3:19:25.320]  to like literally like my brain was enlightened, you know.
[3:19:25.320 --> 3:19:26.400]  I could think again.
[3:19:26.400 --> 3:19:28.200]  I could connect with people again.
[3:19:28.200 --> 3:19:31.000]  And over the course of the next couple of years,
[3:19:31.000 --> 3:19:32.840]  I got my health back and I religiously
[3:19:32.840 --> 3:19:34.640]  take basically all of your supplements.
[3:19:34.640 --> 3:19:37.040]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[3:19:37.040 --> 3:19:38.840]  The one I like recently is knockout.
[3:19:38.840 --> 3:19:41.080]  It literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[3:19:41.080 --> 3:19:41.800]  It's amazing.
[3:19:41.800 --> 3:19:42.360]  It works.
[3:19:42.360 --> 3:19:44.960]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[3:19:44.960 --> 3:19:47.480]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[3:19:47.480 --> 3:19:50.040]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health
[3:19:50.040 --> 3:19:51.120]  into our own hands.
[3:19:51.120 --> 3:19:52.360]  Beautifully said, brother.
[3:19:52.360 --> 3:19:54.400]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[3:19:57.520 --> 3:20:02.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[3:20:02.120 --> 3:20:03.320]  it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:03.320 --> 3:20:13.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:13.320 --> 3:20:19.320]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[3:20:19.320 --> 3:20:23.320]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:23.320 --> 3:20:27.320]  And at the show that does SuperVille like you.
[3:20:27.320 --> 3:20:33.320]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones show and at the show that
[3:20:33.320 --> 3:20:35.320]  does SuperVille vitality.
[3:20:35.320 --> 3:20:36.320]  Boy, I got that stuff.
[3:20:36.320 --> 3:20:40.320]  I love SuperVille vitality.
[3:20:40.320 --> 3:20:42.320]  Give me that extra boost.
[3:20:42.320 --> 3:20:44.320]  Yep.
[3:20:44.320 --> 3:20:46.320]  Great products.
[3:20:46.320 --> 3:20:47.320]  Milan.
[3:20:47.320 --> 3:20:50.320]  Italy is making life more uncomfortable for unvaccinated
[3:20:50.320 --> 3:20:52.320]  people this holiday season.
[3:20:52.320 --> 3:20:54.320]  Happy holidays.
[3:20:54.320 --> 3:20:56.320]  Happy holidays.
[3:20:56.320 --> 3:20:59.320]  Excluding them from indoor restaurants, theaters, and
[3:20:59.320 --> 3:21:02.320]  museums starting today.
[3:21:02.320 --> 3:21:07.320]  Italian police have been empowered to check whether diners
[3:21:07.320 --> 3:21:11.320]  in restaurants or bars have a quote,
[3:21:11.320 --> 3:21:16.320]  super green health pass, certifying that they have been
[3:21:16.320 --> 3:21:20.320]  either vaccinated or recently recovered from the virus.
[3:21:20.320 --> 3:21:23.320]  Smartphone applications have verified people's health pass
[3:21:23.320 --> 3:21:28.320]  status have been updated to prevent entry to concerts,
[3:21:28.320 --> 3:21:35.320]  movies or performances to anyone that has not gotten the
[3:21:35.320 --> 3:21:38.320]  green health pass.
[3:21:38.320 --> 3:21:44.320]  The measures run through January 15th.
[3:21:44.320 --> 3:21:45.320]  Okay.
[3:21:45.320 --> 3:21:48.320]  Why not January 16th?
[3:21:48.320 --> 3:21:51.320]  Why I say January 18th?
[3:21:51.320 --> 3:21:55.320]  You know, I'm in charge.
[3:21:55.320 --> 3:21:59.320]  It's January 17th.
[3:21:59.320 --> 3:22:01.320]  Hey, but wait a minute.
[3:22:01.320 --> 3:22:04.320]  The Blasio, you know, he's not making his orders until
[3:22:04.320 --> 3:22:07.320]  December 27th.
[3:22:07.320 --> 3:22:09.320]  We make up anything.
[3:22:09.320 --> 3:22:13.320]  They're making his crap up.
[3:22:13.320 --> 3:22:19.320]  And they're sucking the joy out of life.
[3:22:19.320 --> 3:22:23.320]  capital Rome, dozens of police are out at transportation hubs,
[3:22:23.320 --> 3:22:27.520]  checking both green passes and personal identification,
[3:22:28.440 --> 3:22:33.060]  finding a cooperative mood among the commuters.
[3:22:34.440 --> 3:22:38.480]  Yep, frankly, I think we are tired of being locked down.
[3:22:38.480 --> 3:22:41.480]  I work at a young company and it was a race
[3:22:41.480 --> 3:22:46.160]  to get the vaccine, Ms. Veronica Bianchi said.
[3:22:46.160 --> 3:22:51.160]  Hmm, I work in a young company and that's what's going on.
[3:22:55.840 --> 3:22:58.160]  The young people are going for the vaxes.
[3:22:59.560 --> 3:23:01.200]  You look at this crowd out there
[3:23:01.200 --> 3:23:03.120]  that's protesting this in Italy.
[3:23:04.080 --> 3:23:07.920]  You look at the people, they're older people,
[3:23:07.920 --> 3:23:11.560]  not young people, the young people are getting the jab.
[3:23:11.560 --> 3:23:15.640]  It's the older people that are against it.
[3:23:17.000 --> 3:23:20.280]  The young people aren't protesting as much.
[3:23:21.560 --> 3:23:24.200]  It's the older generations.
[3:23:24.200 --> 3:23:26.560]  Oh, they're out there for climate change,
[3:23:26.560 --> 3:23:31.560]  but they're not out there for freedom, freedom, freedom.
[3:23:34.920 --> 3:23:37.560]  Again, there is going to be,
[3:23:37.560 --> 3:23:39.880]  I've been warning about this in the trends journal
[3:23:39.880 --> 3:23:42.840]  since the COVID war began, there's going to be,
[3:23:42.840 --> 3:23:45.280]  yeah, look, you see the people,
[3:23:45.280 --> 3:23:49.760]  there's a kid there for most of the people are older people.
[3:23:53.760 --> 3:23:55.920]  Young people should be flooding the streets.
[3:23:58.520 --> 3:23:59.360]  They're not.
[3:24:01.680 --> 3:24:02.520]  How come?
[3:24:03.520 --> 3:24:04.720]  They're brainwashed.
[3:24:04.720 --> 3:24:09.720]  Look what's going to happen to the young kids today.
[3:24:11.160 --> 3:24:14.600]  The kids in grade school, high school,
[3:24:14.600 --> 3:24:17.320]  living under these mandates and pressures.
[3:24:18.480 --> 3:24:21.000]  As they grow older and get into positions
[3:24:21.000 --> 3:24:23.760]  and leading businesses and getting into politics.
[3:24:24.880 --> 3:24:27.160]  Yeah, again, older people.
[3:24:30.040 --> 3:24:32.560]  They are going to bring their sickness
[3:24:32.560 --> 3:24:36.200]  into the new ruling class
[3:24:36.200 --> 3:24:39.160]  because they have been indoctrinated
[3:24:39.160 --> 3:24:42.440]  to be told what to do, how to do it, when to do it,
[3:24:42.440 --> 3:24:44.120]  why to do it.
[3:24:44.120 --> 3:24:46.120]  They're going to keep bringing that forward
[3:24:47.120 --> 3:24:48.680]  in future generations.
[3:24:49.680 --> 3:24:52.360]  So this is a very serious, very serious,
[3:24:52.360 --> 3:24:54.560]  because they're making this crap up in schools
[3:24:54.560 --> 3:24:56.160]  what they're telling kids to do.
[3:24:57.920 --> 3:24:59.760]  I had a situation where they,
[3:24:59.760 --> 3:25:03.760]  they made a bunch of kids stay home, and there we are.
[3:25:03.760 --> 3:25:07.760]  Look at this clown, look at this jerk, look at this jerk.
[3:25:07.760 --> 3:25:11.200]  How can anybody listen to this stupid piece of crap?
[3:25:12.200 --> 3:25:15.760]  I eat crap, I spit out crap, I'm full of crap.
[3:25:15.760 --> 3:25:16.760]  Here's the proof.
[3:25:17.760 --> 3:25:21.360]  Again, these demonstrations are going to keep going on.
[3:25:22.760 --> 3:25:24.760]  And there are always agents, provocateurs
[3:25:24.760 --> 3:25:26.760]  that are going to make it look terrible.
[3:25:26.760 --> 3:25:29.760]  There's going to be a new political movement
[3:25:29.760 --> 3:25:31.760]  in countries around the world.
[3:25:31.760 --> 3:25:33.760]  This is going to destroy the economy.
[3:25:33.760 --> 3:25:35.760]  It's being artificially propped up.
[3:25:36.760 --> 3:25:39.760]  So what's going to go up, what's going to go down?
[3:25:40.760 --> 3:25:43.760]  GSB is my belief.
[3:25:43.760 --> 3:25:45.760]  Gold, silver, and Bitcoin.
[3:25:47.760 --> 3:25:50.760]  The streets are a shadow of what they used to be.
[3:25:50.760 --> 3:25:52.760]  At night, it's dead.
[3:25:52.760 --> 3:25:54.760]  Where I am up here in Kingston, New York,
[3:25:54.760 --> 3:25:56.760]  nine o'clock at night, it's dead.
[3:25:58.760 --> 3:26:01.760]  Again, these protests are great, they're wonderful,
[3:26:01.760 --> 3:26:05.760]  but you have to do like they did with the Berlin Wall
[3:26:05.760 --> 3:26:08.760]  or the Indian Farmers just did.
[3:26:08.760 --> 3:26:10.760]  When the Berlin Wall came down, people went
[3:26:10.760 --> 3:26:12.760]  and they didn't leave.
[3:26:12.760 --> 3:26:13.760]  Day after day, night after night.
[3:26:13.760 --> 3:26:15.760]  You don't go protest, you don't go protest,
[3:26:15.760 --> 3:26:17.760]  you don't go protest, you don't go protest,
[3:26:17.760 --> 3:26:20.760]  you don't go protest, you don't go protest.
[3:26:20.760 --> 3:26:22.760]  Day after day, night after night, you don't go protest,
[3:26:22.760 --> 3:26:24.760]  you don't go home, you go and you don't leave.
[3:26:24.760 --> 3:26:27.760]  Same thing just happened with the Indian Farmers.
[3:26:27.760 --> 3:26:31.760]  They took to the streets for months, for months,
[3:26:31.760 --> 3:26:35.760]  almost a year, and they beat it.
[3:26:35.760 --> 3:26:37.760]  That's it.
[3:26:37.760 --> 3:26:39.760]  The people didn't leave.
[3:26:39.760 --> 3:26:42.760]  They beat it, they just beat it.
[3:26:43.760 --> 3:26:47.760]  In India, we've been writing about it in the magazine.
[3:26:47.760 --> 3:26:51.760]  The only way it comes down is when you protest and don't leave.
[3:26:51.760 --> 3:26:53.760]  You have to surround city hall.
[3:26:53.760 --> 3:26:55.760]  You have to surround the capital.
[3:26:55.760 --> 3:26:57.760]  You don't tell us what to do.
[3:26:57.760 --> 3:27:00.760]  We have our constitutional rights.
[3:27:00.760 --> 3:27:05.760]  But now this little Warren Wilhelm Jr. hired Warren.
[3:27:05.760 --> 3:27:07.760]  Yeah.
[3:27:07.760 --> 3:27:12.760]  The hell with the First Amendment that gives you religious rights.
[3:27:12.760 --> 3:27:16.760]  That if you don't believe, if your religion does not believe
[3:27:16.760 --> 3:27:18.760]  in a vaccination, they're the Indian Farmers.
[3:27:18.760 --> 3:27:21.760]  They didn't leave for almost a year.
[3:27:21.760 --> 3:27:23.760]  For almost a year.
[3:27:23.760 --> 3:27:25.760]  And they killed about 100 of them.
[3:27:25.760 --> 3:27:26.760]  They didn't leave.
[3:27:26.760 --> 3:27:27.760]  More came.
[3:27:27.760 --> 3:27:29.760]  And they defeated the bill.
[3:27:29.760 --> 3:27:32.760]  United we stand, divided we fall.
[3:27:32.760 --> 3:27:34.760]  So here's Warren Wilhelm.
[3:27:34.760 --> 3:27:35.760]  Look at it, look at it.
[3:27:35.760 --> 3:27:37.760]  Hey fat boy, look at a double chin.
[3:27:37.760 --> 3:27:39.760]  Double chin eating that crap yet.
[3:27:39.760 --> 3:27:42.760]  And spewing out crap from your double chin.
[3:27:42.760 --> 3:27:45.760]  Religious exemptions.
[3:27:45.760 --> 3:27:49.760]  They want, well, if you want one, you go to our website,
[3:27:49.760 --> 3:27:53.760]  freedompeacejustice.com, freedompeacejustice.com.
[3:27:53.760 --> 3:27:58.760]  He is denying religions a violation of the First Amendment
[3:27:58.760 --> 3:28:00.760]  to people's religious rights.
[3:28:00.760 --> 3:28:02.760]  It's right there.
[3:28:02.760 --> 3:28:04.760]  There it is.
[3:28:04.760 --> 3:28:09.760]  Uniting people of all races, colors and creeds to live heaven on earth.
[3:28:09.760 --> 3:28:11.760]  Freedom.
[3:28:11.760 --> 3:28:13.760]  And that's what we're about.
[3:28:13.760 --> 3:28:15.760]  And they're robbing it from us.
[3:28:15.760 --> 3:28:17.760]  And we could win.
[3:28:17.760 --> 3:28:19.760]  And they're doing it all over the world.
[3:28:19.760 --> 3:28:21.760]  They're uniting for freedom.
[3:28:21.760 --> 3:28:23.760]  The one word.
[3:28:23.760 --> 3:28:29.760]  A declaration of independence, life, liberty and a pursuit of happiness.
[3:28:29.760 --> 3:28:34.760]  When we come back, we're going to talk in detail about some of the top trends
[3:28:34.760 --> 3:28:39.760]  that are forming in 2022 that you need to know about.
[3:28:39.760 --> 3:28:42.760]  To prepare, prevail and prosper.
[3:28:42.760 --> 3:28:44.760]  I've been doing this now 41 years.
[3:28:44.760 --> 3:28:46.760]  Never saw anything like this before.
[3:28:46.760 --> 3:28:48.760]  We're going to be right back.
[3:28:48.760 --> 3:28:50.760]  Remember, support Infowars.
[3:28:50.760 --> 3:29:13.760]  Go to infowarsstores.com.
[3:29:21.760 --> 3:29:23.760]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell,
[3:29:23.760 --> 3:29:25.760]  we know this is all really happening.
[3:29:25.760 --> 3:29:27.760]  And it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[3:29:27.760 --> 3:29:29.760]  But there is only two things to do.
[3:29:29.760 --> 3:29:33.760]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[3:29:33.760 --> 3:29:36.760]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[3:29:36.760 --> 3:29:39.760]  But even when we win, and we eventually will,
[3:29:39.760 --> 3:29:42.760]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[3:29:42.760 --> 3:29:46.760]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods,
[3:29:46.760 --> 3:29:51.760]  water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios,
[3:29:51.760 --> 3:30:17.760]  and life-saving knowledge at Infowarsstore.com.

[3:30:27.760 --> 3:30:29.760]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do.
[3:30:29.760 --> 3:30:30.760]  These aren't.
[3:30:30.760 --> 3:30:32.760]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[3:30:32.760 --> 3:30:35.760]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes,
[3:30:35.760 --> 3:30:37.760]  $150 minutes.
[3:30:37.760 --> 3:30:39.760]  So the calls you are free works like a regular cell phone.
[3:30:39.760 --> 3:30:40.760]  You're not being tracked or traced.
[3:30:40.760 --> 3:30:41.760]  And I keep one in my car.
[3:30:41.760 --> 3:30:43.760]  I've given it to my parents as gifts
[3:30:43.760 --> 3:30:45.760]  way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work.
[3:30:45.760 --> 3:30:46.760]  They work.
[3:30:46.760 --> 3:30:51.760]  Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-Dent2941-955-Dent20,
[3:30:51.760 --> 3:30:54.760]  and ask the Alex Jones special.
[3:30:54.760 --> 3:30:57.760]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming.
[3:30:57.760 --> 3:31:00.760]  They're here all over the world, from Australia
[3:31:00.760 --> 3:31:02.760]  to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[3:31:02.760 --> 3:31:04.760]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do,
[3:31:04.760 --> 3:31:05.760]  everywhere you go.
[3:31:05.760 --> 3:31:07.760]  And then coming to your house and threatening,
[3:31:07.760 --> 3:31:11.760]  in some cases, actually taking people away into the night
[3:31:11.760 --> 3:31:13.760]  to their facilities.
[3:31:13.760 --> 3:31:16.760]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield
[3:31:16.760 --> 3:31:18.760]  process where they come and take, quote,
[3:31:18.760 --> 3:31:21.760]  healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[3:31:21.760 --> 3:31:23.760]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[3:31:23.760 --> 3:31:25.760]  And one big thing you can do to fight back
[3:31:25.760 --> 3:31:27.760]  is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[3:31:27.760 --> 3:31:29.760]  many of which are made here in America,
[3:31:29.760 --> 3:31:31.760]  and are very compliant, meaning U.S.

[3:32:45.760 --> 3:32:46.760]  fighting for liberty.
[3:32:46.760 --> 3:32:53.760]  God bless and thanks for your support.
[3:33:16.760 --> 3:33:17.760]  Corruption.
[3:33:17.760 --> 3:33:20.760]  It's Gerald Salente.
[3:33:20.760 --> 3:33:23.760]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:23.760 --> 3:33:25.760]  It's getting there, Tom.
[3:33:25.760 --> 3:33:28.760]  Hey, great being on The Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:28.760 --> 3:33:31.760]  And as Alex said, you're fighting for liberty.
[3:33:31.760 --> 3:33:34.760]  As I said, freedom is the word.
[3:33:34.760 --> 3:33:37.760]  And that's going to be the big, big, big word.
[3:33:37.760 --> 3:33:39.760]  Every one of these rallies, every protest,
[3:33:39.760 --> 3:33:41.760]  it's about freedom.
[3:33:41.760 --> 3:33:43.760]  Freedom, freedom, freedom.
[3:33:43.760 --> 3:33:46.760]  That's why I also started the Universal Church of Freedom,
[3:33:46.760 --> 3:33:48.760]  Peace and Justice.
[3:33:48.760 --> 3:33:51.760]  So it's very important to support info wars
[3:33:51.760 --> 3:33:52.760]  to keep the truth alive.
[3:33:52.760 --> 3:33:54.760]  And they have great, great products

[3:34:05.760 --> 3:34:07.760]  And it has arrived.
[3:34:07.760 --> 3:34:08.760]  That's right.
[3:34:08.760 --> 3:34:10.760]  So Cyber Week, it's here right now.

[3:36:05.760 --> 3:36:08.760]  against the mainstream media attacks.
[3:36:08.760 --> 3:36:11.760]  And boy, are they attacking.
[3:36:11.760 --> 3:36:14.760]  You can't say anything that they don't want you to say.
[3:36:14.760 --> 3:36:17.760]  You have to believe what they say.
[3:36:17.760 --> 3:36:20.760]  And like, hey, they got rid of little Chris Cuomo over there
[3:36:20.760 --> 3:36:21.760]  at CNN.
[3:36:21.760 --> 3:36:24.760]  And they got rid of Andy Cuomo over here as governor.
[3:36:24.760 --> 3:36:26.760]  So let's rename the Tappenzee Bridge,
[3:36:26.760 --> 3:36:30.760]  the Tappenzee Bridge, that little Andy named after his daddy,
[3:36:30.760 --> 3:36:33.760]  the Mario Cuomo Bridge.
[3:36:33.760 --> 3:36:36.760]  Being that you got two arrogant little clowns over there
[3:36:36.760 --> 3:36:39.760]  that are Cuomos, I say bring back the name
[3:36:39.760 --> 3:36:41.760]  the Tappenzee Bridge.
[3:36:41.760 --> 3:36:43.760]  What is Cuomo, father?
[3:36:43.760 --> 3:36:44.760]  Better than mine?
[3:36:44.760 --> 3:36:46.760]  Screw you!
[3:36:46.760 --> 3:36:50.760]  How about naming it the Louis Salenti Bridge?
[3:36:50.760 --> 3:36:53.760]  Or Luigi, Salantano, that would be more proper.
[3:36:53.760 --> 3:36:55.760]  Yeah.
[3:36:55.760 --> 3:36:57.760]  Yeah, a bunch of crap.
[3:36:57.760 --> 3:37:00.760]  Crapsters are running the world.
[3:37:00.760 --> 3:37:02.760]  Going back to some trends.
[3:37:02.760 --> 3:37:04.760]  Again, the markets are going up.
[3:37:04.760 --> 3:37:07.760]  It's a rigged game.
[3:37:07.760 --> 3:37:09.760]  They're going to keep doing everything they are.
[3:37:09.760 --> 3:37:10.760]  Look at this.
[3:37:10.760 --> 3:37:11.760]  Look at this.
[3:37:11.760 --> 3:37:12.760]  Two arrogant little boys.
[3:37:12.760 --> 3:37:13.760]  Gone.
[3:37:13.760 --> 3:37:14.760]  Whoop.
[3:37:14.760 --> 3:37:16.760]  What are you going to do now, huh?
[3:37:16.760 --> 3:37:18.760]  What are you going to do now?
[3:37:18.760 --> 3:37:20.760]  Tappenzee Bridge.
[3:37:20.760 --> 3:37:22.760]  Bring back the Tappenzee Bridge.
[3:37:22.760 --> 3:37:24.760]  Get rid of the Cuomo name.
[3:37:24.760 --> 3:37:29.760]  I would see it as smell it because it smells like crap.
[3:37:29.760 --> 3:37:34.760]  Anyway, the markets, they're up.
[3:37:34.760 --> 3:37:43.760]  Oil, oil prices were down to under $70 a barrel, Brent Crue.
[3:37:43.760 --> 3:37:46.760]  Now there were about $72 a barrel.
[3:37:46.760 --> 3:37:52.760]  They were at $87 a barrel in October.
[3:37:52.760 --> 3:37:56.760]  You're the end of October.
[3:37:56.760 --> 3:37:58.760]  This is big.
[3:37:58.760 --> 3:38:03.760]  Oil is telling you where the future is going.
[3:38:03.760 --> 3:38:06.760]  Oil prices were $87 a barrel.
[3:38:06.760 --> 3:38:11.760]  Now there's $72 for Brent Crue.
[3:38:11.760 --> 3:38:13.760]  It tells you the economy is slowing down.
[3:38:13.760 --> 3:38:17.760]  Supply and demand.
[3:38:17.760 --> 3:38:22.760]  What's also important about this are going to be the implications.
[3:38:22.760 --> 3:38:25.760]  You think you have a migrant crisis now?
[3:38:25.760 --> 3:38:27.760]  You haven't seen anything.
[3:38:27.760 --> 3:38:33.760]  And by the way, they don't report anywhere what's going on in a place called Ethiopia.
[3:38:33.760 --> 3:38:44.760]  That's only the second largest country in Africa with the war going on.
[3:38:44.760 --> 3:38:47.760]  Where are the people going to go?
[3:38:47.760 --> 3:38:49.760]  It's war-torn nation.
[3:38:49.760 --> 3:38:51.760]  Yep.
[3:38:51.760 --> 3:38:54.760]  They're going to be going to Europe.
[3:38:54.760 --> 3:38:57.760]  Look at the inflation rates.
[3:38:57.760 --> 3:38:59.760]  Who are they hitting the hardest?
[3:38:59.760 --> 3:39:01.760]  How about south of the border?
[3:39:01.760 --> 3:39:02.760]  Yep.
[3:39:02.760 --> 3:39:04.760]  People are going to be flooding over.
[3:39:04.760 --> 3:39:08.760]  The more they lock down, the more people are going to put out of business.
[3:39:08.760 --> 3:39:11.760]  The more lives and livelihoods they're going to destroy.
[3:39:11.760 --> 3:39:16.760]  We're going to see a migrant wave, the likes of which we've never seen before, all over the world
[3:39:16.760 --> 3:39:21.760]  as they keep fighting this COVID war.
[3:39:21.760 --> 3:39:26.760]  You're also going to see a big rise in homelessness.
[3:39:26.760 --> 3:39:28.760]  Everywhere.
[3:39:28.760 --> 3:39:30.760]  And people out of their minds.
[3:39:30.760 --> 3:39:34.760]  And by the way, you know why a lot of people aren't going back to work?
[3:39:34.760 --> 3:39:37.760]  Because so many people are drugged out.
[3:39:37.760 --> 3:39:39.760]  Yeah.
[3:39:39.760 --> 3:39:46.760]  So you're going to see this migrant crisis, the likes of which you've never seen before, around the world.
[3:39:46.760 --> 3:39:49.760]  And I have a solution for it, by the way.
[3:39:49.760 --> 3:39:51.760]  It's part of my occupied piece.
[3:39:51.760 --> 3:39:53.760]  Bring home the troops.
[3:39:53.760 --> 3:39:55.760]  Stop this bologna over there.
[3:39:55.760 --> 3:39:57.760]  We've got 800 bases around the world.
[3:39:57.760 --> 3:39:58.760]  For what?
[3:39:58.760 --> 3:40:01.760]  World War II ended in 1945.
[3:40:01.760 --> 3:40:03.760]  Yeah, there's your homeless, right?
[3:40:03.760 --> 3:40:05.760]  Everywhere.
[3:40:05.760 --> 3:40:07.760]  So I have a homeless solution.
[3:40:07.760 --> 3:40:11.760]  But first I'm going to go back to the migrant solution.
[3:40:11.760 --> 3:40:13.760]  We don't need more people in this country.
[3:40:13.760 --> 3:40:15.760]  We can't take care of who we have.
[3:40:15.760 --> 3:40:20.760]  Bring home the troops and use the troops to secure the homeland.
[3:40:20.760 --> 3:40:22.760]  You don't build a wall.
[3:40:22.760 --> 3:40:24.760]  You've got enough of these in high technology.
[3:40:24.760 --> 3:40:27.760]  You've got all these troops out there in all these foreign countries.
[3:40:27.760 --> 3:40:32.760]  Close down the bases and put them to secure our homeland.
[3:40:32.760 --> 3:40:36.760]  And then put them to work rebuilding our rodent infrastructure.
[3:40:36.760 --> 3:40:37.760]  Back to the homeless.
[3:40:37.760 --> 3:40:40.760]  The Salente solution.
[3:40:40.760 --> 3:40:50.760]  In New York City, it's costing us $3.2 billion a year to house 60,000 homeless people.
[3:40:50.760 --> 3:40:55.760]  $3.2 billion comes out to $53,000 a person.
[3:40:55.760 --> 3:40:58.760]  How many people out there could live on $53,000 a year?
[3:40:58.760 --> 3:40:59.760]  Really nice.
[3:40:59.760 --> 3:41:00.760]  Just by yourself.
[3:41:00.760 --> 3:41:02.760]  Ain't bad.
[3:41:02.760 --> 3:41:05.760]  And we're giving them shelter and it's costing that.
[3:41:05.760 --> 3:41:08.760]  I say build homeless towns.
[3:41:08.760 --> 3:41:10.760]  Like do you guys have Boys Town?
[3:41:10.760 --> 3:41:12.760]  Like up where I am and the Catskills over here.
[3:41:12.760 --> 3:41:16.760]  There's a lot of empty space where the old Borscht Belt hotels used to be.
[3:41:16.760 --> 3:41:18.760]  Redo them.
[3:41:18.760 --> 3:41:25.760]  Create a homeless town where you're giving the people skills, things to do.
[3:41:25.760 --> 3:41:29.760]  And the summer they're working outside in the winter, they're doing arts, crafts,
[3:41:29.760 --> 3:41:31.760]  making things, giving them purpose.
[3:41:31.760 --> 3:41:35.760]  $3.2 billion to take care.
[3:41:35.760 --> 3:41:37.760]  Arrogant William Jr.
[3:41:37.760 --> 3:41:39.760]  Give them the money.
[3:41:39.760 --> 3:41:41.760]  It's only from us to taxpayers.
[3:41:41.760 --> 3:41:43.760]  You don't pay anything.
[3:41:43.760 --> 3:41:46.760]  You're a clown and you're set for the rest of your life.
[3:41:46.760 --> 3:41:49.760]  The homeless solution, get them off the streets.
[3:41:49.760 --> 3:41:51.760]  Get them out of shelters.
[3:41:51.760 --> 3:41:53.760]  Who owns the shelters?
[3:41:53.760 --> 3:41:55.760]  Oh, their buddies.
[3:41:55.760 --> 3:41:57.760]  Yeah, they give them money.
[3:41:57.760 --> 3:42:01.760]  Morons and imbeciles call campaign contributions.
[3:42:01.760 --> 3:42:03.760]  Shelter?
[3:42:03.760 --> 3:42:05.760]  You don't give a put them in a shelter.
[3:42:05.760 --> 3:42:07.760]  A shelter is only temporary.
[3:42:07.760 --> 3:42:09.760]  Homeless towns.
[3:42:09.760 --> 3:42:11.760]  Homeless towns.
[3:42:11.760 --> 3:42:13.760]  California, you got plenty of land to put these people in.
[3:42:13.760 --> 3:42:15.760]  Give them a nice place.
[3:42:15.760 --> 3:42:17.760]  Give them respect, dignity.
[3:42:17.760 --> 3:42:19.760]  Build them up.
[3:42:19.760 --> 3:42:21.760]  Rather than bringing everything down.
[3:42:21.760 --> 3:42:24.760]  This is pure stupidity.
[3:42:24.760 --> 3:42:26.760]  And you know why it's pure stupidity?
[3:42:26.760 --> 3:42:29.760]  Because politicians are in charge.
[3:42:29.760 --> 3:42:33.760]  They're worthless pieces of crap.
[3:42:33.760 --> 3:42:35.760]  I was in the system.
[3:42:35.760 --> 3:42:38.760]  I know what it is.
[3:42:38.760 --> 3:42:41.760]  We need people need to take charge.
[3:42:41.760 --> 3:42:43.760]  Clean up this mess.
[3:42:43.760 --> 3:42:45.760]  Get them out of there.
[3:42:45.760 --> 3:42:47.760]  Homeless towns.
[3:42:47.760 --> 3:42:49.760]  Rise them higher.
[3:42:49.760 --> 3:42:51.760]  Make this nicer.
[3:42:51.760 --> 3:42:56.760]  We need to be right here.
[3:43:22.760 --> 3:43:24.760]  Thanks for your support.
[3:43:24.760 --> 3:43:26.760]  But now, as 2021 comes to a close,
[3:43:26.760 --> 3:43:30.760]  I want to encourage you now more than ever
[3:43:30.760 --> 3:43:32.760]  to support the truth.
[3:43:32.760 --> 3:43:35.760]  And you do that at infomorestore.com.
[3:43:35.760 --> 3:43:37.760]  Storewide free shipping.
[3:43:37.760 --> 3:43:39.760]  Double-patriot points running right now.
[3:43:39.760 --> 3:43:41.760]  Huge deals of bottom mineral fusion,
[3:43:41.760 --> 3:43:43.760]  DNA Force Plus, and lung cleanse,
[3:43:43.760 --> 3:43:45.760]  and turbo force.
[3:43:45.760 --> 3:43:47.760]  And these are really amazing high quality products
[3:43:47.760 --> 3:43:49.760]  that also fund the info more.
[3:43:49.760 --> 3:43:53.760]  The only way you fail is not taking action.
[3:44:20.760 --> 3:44:23.760]  And many of their own reports and internal meetings were leaked.
[3:44:23.760 --> 3:44:25.760]  You see, then I was tracking the Bilderberg group,
[3:44:25.760 --> 3:44:28.760]  who's head at the time, was Klaus Schwab.
[3:44:28.760 --> 3:44:30.760]  And our sources inside were confirming to us
[3:44:30.760 --> 3:44:33.760]  that they were indeed planning to launch this great reset.
[3:44:33.760 --> 3:44:35.760]  Well, we're now living in it.
[3:44:35.760 --> 3:44:38.760]  The purposeful collapse of the third world and the first world,
[3:44:38.760 --> 3:44:41.760]  known as the tyrannical corporate world government.
[3:44:41.760 --> 3:44:43.760]  The total censorship, no due process,
[3:44:43.760 --> 3:44:45.760]  destruction of the family,
[3:44:45.760 --> 3:44:48.760]  and then incrementally more and more deadly injections
[3:44:48.760 --> 3:44:50.760]  of poison mass creating as vaccines
[3:44:50.760 --> 3:44:52.760]  to poison us in the populace.
[3:44:52.760 --> 3:44:54.760]  This is what info wars is fighting.
[3:44:54.760 --> 3:45:22.760]  We're fighting for the future.
[3:45:25.760 --> 3:45:30.760]  It's 50% off, again, with free shipping.
[3:45:30.760 --> 3:45:33.760]  And some items are even above 50% off.
[3:45:33.760 --> 3:45:36.760]  Go to infowarstore.com, get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt,
[3:45:36.760 --> 3:45:38.760]  get water filtration, get air filtration.
[3:45:38.760 --> 3:45:40.760]  But whatever you do, do your shopping there
[3:45:40.760 --> 3:45:42.760]  with patriots that are fighting for all
[3:45:42.760 --> 3:45:44.760]  of our collective liberties together.
[3:45:44.760 --> 3:45:46.760]  If you shop at the big box stores,
[3:45:46.760 --> 3:45:48.760]  you deserve to be a slave.
[3:45:48.760 --> 3:45:51.760]  If you shop at info wars, you're part of the team fighting for liberty.
[3:45:51.760 --> 3:45:54.760]  God bless and thanks for your support.
[3:46:22.760 --> 3:46:30.760]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[3:46:30.760 --> 3:46:34.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[3:46:34.760 --> 3:46:38.760]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[3:46:38.760 --> 3:46:41.760]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips
[3:46:41.760 --> 3:46:44.760]  as part of the World ID and carbon taxes.
[3:46:44.760 --> 3:46:47.760]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[3:46:47.760 --> 3:46:50.760]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[3:46:50.760 --> 3:46:53.760]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[3:46:56.760 --> 3:47:00.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[3:47:00.760 --> 3:47:03.760]  it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:15.760 --> 3:47:18.760]  Hey, hey, hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:18.760 --> 3:47:23.760]  Remember, they have that info wars cyber week special.
[3:47:23.760 --> 3:47:26.760]  So take advantage of it as you can.
[3:47:26.760 --> 3:47:28.760]  And again, support info wars.
[3:47:28.760 --> 3:47:31.760]  We need the truth in what's going on in the world
[3:47:31.760 --> 3:47:34.760]  and they're blackballing us from knowing what's going on.
[3:47:34.760 --> 3:47:40.760]  Go to infowarsstore.com and keep the truth alive.
[3:47:40.760 --> 3:47:43.760]  So going on to what's going on in the markets,
[3:47:43.760 --> 3:47:47.760]  it's very, very important because there's going to be a real shakeout at some point.
[3:47:47.760 --> 3:47:51.760]  And it's being artificially propped up.
[3:47:51.760 --> 3:47:53.760]  There's no question about it.
[3:47:53.760 --> 3:47:57.760]  And we're talking now the markets up about 670 points.
[3:47:57.760 --> 3:47:58.760]  Why?
[3:47:58.760 --> 3:48:03.760]  Oh, the Omicron, they're saying, they're bypassing that.
[3:48:03.760 --> 3:48:04.760]  They're overlooking it.
[3:48:04.760 --> 3:48:07.760]  Okay, you're overlooking it as you just heard
[3:48:07.760 --> 3:48:10.760]  Warren Wilhelm, Jr. putting in more mandates.
[3:48:10.760 --> 3:48:12.760]  I tell you what's going on in Austria,
[3:48:12.760 --> 3:48:16.760]  Czech Republic, Slovakia, France, Italy,
[3:48:16.760 --> 3:48:19.760]  Germany, one place after another,
[3:48:19.760 --> 3:48:21.760]  more mandates, more lockdowns,
[3:48:21.760 --> 3:48:25.760]  no vacs, no freedom, great for tourism business,
[3:48:25.760 --> 3:48:27.760]  excellent in the restaurant business.
[3:48:27.760 --> 3:48:31.760]  And again, we're coming out to a new magazine tomorrow
[3:48:31.760 --> 3:48:36.760]  and the data coming out of Europe from November
[3:48:36.760 --> 3:48:39.760]  in the hospitality sector and restaurant business
[3:48:39.760 --> 3:48:45.760]  was going down deeply even before the moronicron virus
[3:48:45.760 --> 3:48:46.760]  hit.
[3:48:46.760 --> 3:48:50.760]  So this is going to have a big negative impact on the economy.
[3:48:50.760 --> 3:48:53.760]  So what's going to happen in 2022?
[3:48:53.760 --> 3:48:57.760]  One of the things to look for is we call dragflation.
[3:48:57.760 --> 3:49:01.760]  They're saying stagflation, a stagnant economy
[3:49:01.760 --> 3:49:04.760]  and increasing inflation.
[3:49:04.760 --> 3:49:06.760]  We see dragflation.
[3:49:06.760 --> 3:49:09.760]  The economy is going to be dragged down lower.
[3:49:09.760 --> 3:49:12.760]  Again, look what's going on.
[3:49:12.760 --> 3:49:15.760]  I'm not making this up.
[3:49:15.760 --> 3:49:19.760]  If you're banning people from going out
[3:49:19.760 --> 3:49:23.760]  and you're looking at at least a third of the economy in America,
[3:49:23.760 --> 3:49:27.760]  you have, according to the official numbers,
[3:49:27.760 --> 3:49:30.760]  you have 60% of the people are fully vaccinated,
[3:49:30.760 --> 3:49:33.760]  at least 40% that aren't,
[3:49:33.760 --> 3:49:38.760]  that in major places are not going to be able to go out.
[3:49:38.760 --> 3:49:40.760]  That's going to hurt business.
[3:49:40.760 --> 3:49:45.760]  And now with the new moronicron virus over here,
[3:49:45.760 --> 3:49:48.760]  they're putting travel restrictions on.
[3:49:48.760 --> 3:49:51.760]  So what's that going to do to tourism?
[3:49:51.760 --> 3:49:56.760]  So dragflation, this economy is going down.
[3:49:56.760 --> 3:50:00.760]  You saw the numbers that came out on Black Friday.
[3:50:00.760 --> 3:50:02.760]  There were less people out shopping
[3:50:02.760 --> 3:50:07.760]  and the numbers didn't skyrocket on the internet sales
[3:50:07.760 --> 3:50:09.760]  as they did last year.
[3:50:09.760 --> 3:50:14.760]  The people are going to be running out of dough.
[3:50:14.760 --> 3:50:16.760]  So there you got it.
[3:50:16.760 --> 3:50:18.760]  New York City announces first in the nation
[3:50:18.760 --> 3:50:20.760]  vaccine mandate for private companies.
[3:50:20.760 --> 3:50:22.760]  Who's this clown to do this?
[3:50:22.760 --> 3:50:28.760]  Where is the outrage that our rights are being stolen from us?
[3:50:28.760 --> 3:50:34.760]  From a jerk off over there in New York City.
[3:50:34.760 --> 3:50:37.760]  So this is going to have a very negative effect
[3:50:37.760 --> 3:50:39.760]  because you're going to see the next things
[3:50:39.760 --> 3:50:41.760]  going to start happening in California
[3:50:41.760 --> 3:50:43.760]  with that gruesome Newsome clown.
[3:50:43.760 --> 3:50:45.760]  Oh, and by the way,
[3:50:45.760 --> 3:50:48.760]  how about all the smash and grabs that are going on
[3:50:48.760 --> 3:50:51.760]  by huge numbers of people?
[3:50:51.760 --> 3:50:54.760]  Did we warn you about this in the Trends Journal
[3:50:54.760 --> 3:50:56.760]  when they launched the COVID war?
[3:50:56.760 --> 3:50:58.760]  When people lose everything and have nothing left to lose,
[3:50:58.760 --> 3:51:00.760]  they lose it?
[3:51:00.760 --> 3:51:05.760]  Crime spikes are going to continue.
[3:51:05.760 --> 3:51:09.760]  We're going to go into very rough times.
[3:51:09.760 --> 3:51:11.760]  You better do all you can.
[3:51:11.760 --> 3:51:13.760]  By the way, in the Trends Journal each week,
[3:51:13.760 --> 3:51:19.760]  we have survivalism articles by Bradley Steiner,
[3:51:19.760 --> 3:51:24.760]  who was the top close combat guy in America.
[3:51:24.760 --> 3:51:26.760]  That's right.
[3:51:26.760 --> 3:51:30.760]  So we're helping you prepare.
[3:51:30.760 --> 3:51:32.760]  TrendsJournal.com, TrendsJournal.com,
[3:51:32.760 --> 3:51:34.760]  the only place you're going to read history before it happens,
[3:51:34.760 --> 3:51:36.760]  there's no magazine like it.
[3:51:36.760 --> 3:51:38.760]  If you could show me one, let me know.
[3:51:38.760 --> 3:51:41.760]  Again, we're giving everything we can,
[3:51:41.760 --> 3:51:44.760]  like Info Wars gives everything that they can.
[3:51:44.760 --> 3:51:47.760]  And that's why I do this, to support it.
[3:51:47.760 --> 3:51:49.760]  And you need to support us
[3:51:49.760 --> 3:51:51.760]  because we're in a very, very difficult time.
[3:51:51.760 --> 3:51:53.760]  United we stand divided before.
[3:51:53.760 --> 3:51:55.760]  The more people that support Info Wars,
[3:51:55.760 --> 3:51:57.760]  the more people that support the Trends Journal,
[3:51:57.760 --> 3:51:59.760]  the louder our voices are,
[3:51:59.760 --> 3:52:01.760]  and the more people we could bring together
[3:52:01.760 --> 3:52:03.760]  to fight the corruption going on
[3:52:03.760 --> 3:52:05.760]  and robbing us of our rights.
[3:52:05.760 --> 3:52:08.760]  And by the way, every Wednesday,
[3:52:08.760 --> 3:52:11.760]  every Wednesday on the Gerald Salenti Channel,
[3:52:11.760 --> 3:52:15.760]  I'm doing podcasts with Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[3:52:15.760 --> 3:52:17.760]  And boy, he's really on top of this.
[3:52:17.760 --> 3:52:20.760]  There's no greater authority about the Constitution
[3:52:20.760 --> 3:52:23.760]  in speaking about it as a lawyer, a judge,
[3:52:23.760 --> 3:52:27.760]  and who he is and what he knows than Judge Napolitano.
[3:52:27.760 --> 3:52:31.760]  And again, we are in the fight for our lives, for freedom.
[3:52:31.760 --> 3:52:33.760]  It's being stolen from us.
[3:52:33.760 --> 3:52:35.760]  So going back to dragflation,
[3:52:35.760 --> 3:52:38.760]  again, gold, silver, and Bitcoin,
[3:52:38.760 --> 3:52:40.760]  I do not give financial advice.
[3:52:40.760 --> 3:52:41.760]  Oh, Bitcoin took a big hit,
[3:52:41.760 --> 3:52:44.760]  it's going down to 49,000.
[3:52:44.760 --> 3:52:47.760]  49,000.
[3:52:47.760 --> 3:52:49.760]  And I don't see this thing going down.
[3:52:49.760 --> 3:52:54.760]  And one of our top Trends is crypto capital,
[3:52:54.760 --> 3:52:57.760]  not an A with an O, a capital.
[3:52:57.760 --> 3:52:59.760]  You're going to see more and more cities,
[3:52:59.760 --> 3:53:01.760]  whether it's Miami that's doing it now,
[3:53:01.760 --> 3:53:05.760]  or the new mayor in New York, this guy, Adams.
[3:53:05.760 --> 3:53:07.760]  Wall Street's going to be another street.
[3:53:07.760 --> 3:53:09.760]  It's all a virtual street.
[3:53:09.760 --> 3:53:12.760]  They want to make Wall Street crypto street.
[3:53:12.760 --> 3:53:16.760]  This isn't going to go away as we see it.
[3:53:16.760 --> 3:53:20.760]  So, gold, silver, and Bitcoins,
[3:53:20.760 --> 3:53:23.760]  GSB is the way I see the future.
[3:53:23.760 --> 3:53:25.760]  The only reason the dollar is strong
[3:53:25.760 --> 3:53:28.760]  is because all the other currencies are so weak.
[3:53:28.760 --> 3:53:31.760]  You look what's going on over there in Turkey.
[3:53:31.760 --> 3:53:33.760]  They lower interest rates.
[3:53:33.760 --> 3:53:35.760]  They keep lowering them.
[3:53:35.760 --> 3:53:40.760]  And now the leader has lost about 45% of its value
[3:53:40.760 --> 3:53:42.760]  just this year.
[3:53:42.760 --> 3:53:45.760]  And again, talking about when all those fails,
[3:53:45.760 --> 3:53:47.760]  they take you to war,
[3:53:47.760 --> 3:53:49.760]  you're going to see this guy, Erdogan,
[3:53:49.760 --> 3:53:53.760]  start taking war against the Kurds and Syria
[3:53:53.760 --> 3:53:57.760]  as his popularity tanks, as the economy tanks.
[3:53:57.760 --> 3:54:01.760]  Go back to America in 2001,
[3:54:01.760 --> 3:54:04.760]  little Georgie Bush, another daddy's boy,
[3:54:04.760 --> 3:54:07.760]  another little jerk off over there in Texas,
[3:54:07.760 --> 3:54:10.760]  that would be nobody if daddy wasn't George Bush
[3:54:10.760 --> 3:54:14.760]  and grandpa wasn't Prescott Bush.
[3:54:14.760 --> 3:54:17.760]  The dot-com bust happened in March of 2000.
[3:54:17.760 --> 3:54:22.760]  The Nasdaq was down 66% before 9-11.
[3:54:22.760 --> 3:54:26.760]  We were very diving into a deep recession.
[3:54:26.760 --> 3:54:32.760]  9-11 happens, war against Afghanistan.
[3:54:32.760 --> 3:54:34.760]  Everybody forgot what happened.
[3:54:34.760 --> 3:54:37.760]  And then they artificially boosted up the market
[3:54:37.760 --> 3:54:40.760]  with the fake real estate boom,
[3:54:40.760 --> 3:54:42.760]  which the banksters.
[3:54:42.760 --> 3:54:44.760]  Look at this clown.
[3:54:44.760 --> 3:54:46.760]  Look at him.
[3:54:46.760 --> 3:54:48.760]  Dumb enough to believe Bush's wars,
[3:54:48.760 --> 3:54:50.760]  dumb enough to believe the cover war.
[3:54:50.760 --> 3:54:53.760]  Again, a nothing little boy,
[3:54:53.760 --> 3:54:57.760]  an arrogant little stupid jerk
[3:54:57.760 --> 3:54:59.760]  off over there in Texas,
[3:54:59.760 --> 3:55:02.760]  telling people what to do.
[3:55:02.760 --> 3:55:04.760]  And the people follow.
[3:55:04.760 --> 3:55:07.760]  88% of the people
[3:55:07.760 --> 3:55:10.760]  followed him into the Afghan war.
[3:55:10.760 --> 3:55:12.760]  Hey, great job, huh?
[3:55:12.760 --> 3:55:14.760]  Oh, you guys were terrific.
[3:55:14.760 --> 3:55:16.760]  Yeah, he only cost us a couple of trillion dollars.
[3:55:16.760 --> 3:55:18.760]  He only destroyed the country.
[3:55:18.760 --> 3:55:21.760]  Oh, you got a big refugee problem over there.
[3:55:21.760 --> 3:55:23.760]  You get a great job.
[3:55:23.760 --> 3:55:25.760]  I say, let's start another war.
[3:55:25.760 --> 3:55:27.760]  Yeah, having won one since Vietnam.
[3:55:27.760 --> 3:55:29.760]  No, we lost Vietnam.
[3:55:29.760 --> 3:55:32.760]  World War II.
[3:55:32.760 --> 3:55:34.760]  And again, a lot of people say,
[3:55:34.760 --> 3:55:37.760]  don't get mad at me that the Russians helped do it.
[3:55:37.760 --> 3:55:39.760]  Yeah, which they did.
[3:55:39.760 --> 3:55:42.760]  They got into Germany before the Americans did.
[3:55:42.760 --> 3:55:45.760]  And they only lost about 40 million people,
[3:55:45.760 --> 3:55:47.760]  30 million people.
[3:55:47.760 --> 3:55:49.760]  Yeah.
[3:55:49.760 --> 3:55:51.760]  And those are the hurdles they take you to war.
[3:55:51.760 --> 3:55:53.760]  And that's my greatest fear.
[3:55:53.760 --> 3:55:55.760]  Because this global economy is going to crash
[3:55:55.760 --> 3:55:58.760]  hard and big with these lockdowns.
[3:55:58.760 --> 3:56:00.760]  This is going on now for two years.
[3:56:00.760 --> 3:56:02.760]  It's going to be two years.
[3:56:02.760 --> 3:56:04.760]  And again, the markets are going up
[3:56:04.760 --> 3:56:08.760]  as it's spreading this fear of this moronic ROM virus.
[3:56:08.760 --> 3:56:10.760]  And I guess the people's minds off
[3:56:10.760 --> 3:56:12.760]  like that when you go to war,
[3:56:12.760 --> 3:56:15.760]  and you watch Turkey's going to be the first one,
[3:56:15.760 --> 3:56:18.760]  watch very closely what's going on in the Middle East.
[3:56:18.760 --> 3:56:20.360]  Healed on it.
[3:56:20.360 --> 3:56:22.080]  Watch oil prices.
[3:56:22.080 --> 3:56:24.360]  Very important.
[3:56:24.360 --> 3:56:28.320]  They're going to tell you where the future is going in a lot of ways.
[3:56:28.320 --> 3:56:34.120]  And if tensions keep eating up between Israel and Iran, and military conflict breaks out,
[3:56:34.120 --> 3:56:38.200]  you're going to see oil prices spike into the $100 a barrel, and that's going to crash
[3:56:38.200 --> 3:56:41.160]  the global economy.
[3:56:41.160 --> 3:56:45.320]  Forty-five percent of Americans saying that inflation is hurting them.
[3:56:45.320 --> 3:56:49.400]  Oh, it was only temporary, then it became transitory.
[3:56:49.400 --> 3:56:52.040]  That was the BS they were throwing out there.
[3:56:52.040 --> 3:56:54.880]  Dragflation, it's a big trend.
[3:56:54.880 --> 3:57:00.160]  And again, the current issue of the Trends Journal has the top trends for 2022 to help
[3:57:00.160 --> 3:57:03.600]  you prepare, prevail, and prosper in the times ahead.
[3:57:03.600 --> 3:57:09.760]  I've been at this for 41 years, never, never have I seen trends developing like we're seeing
[3:57:09.760 --> 3:57:15.840]  them now that are going to have such implications, both on the positive and the negative.
[3:57:15.840 --> 3:57:20.000]  There are going to be a lot of on-trend-panor opportunities, and a big one is going to
[3:57:20.000 --> 3:57:21.760]  be in that metaverse as well.
[3:57:21.760 --> 3:57:25.720]  Yep, like it, love it, hate it, it's going to be here.
[3:57:25.720 --> 3:57:35.320]  So remember, we're entering a whole new era on parallel in our history.
[3:57:35.320 --> 3:57:40.920]  Stay tuned with InfoWars, subscribe to the Trends Journal, and go to Peace, Freedom, Peace
[3:57:40.920 --> 3:57:43.440]  Justice, The Vaccine Pass.
[3:57:43.440 --> 3:57:45.720]  Let's go ahead and take a look.
[3:57:45.720 --> 3:57:52.400]  In late August, InfoWars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[3:57:52.400 --> 3:57:57.800]  that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause
[3:57:57.800 --> 3:58:01.880]  an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[3:58:01.880 --> 3:58:05.320]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storeable food has always been something that's important to
[3:58:05.320 --> 3:58:06.320]  have.
[3:58:06.320 --> 3:58:10.640]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water filtration,
[3:58:10.640 --> 3:58:12.920]  self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[3:58:12.920 --> 3:58:16.320]  But now, more than ever, you need to get your storeable food orders in.
[3:58:16.320 --> 3:58:19.720]  Now, we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[3:58:19.720 --> 3:58:23.880]  It's high quality, it's very, very low cost, at InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:58:23.880 --> 3:58:27.680]  Because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages, and you're going
[3:58:27.680 --> 3:58:31.080]  to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[3:58:31.080 --> 3:58:37.360]  So lock in your storeable food now at a lower price and fund the InfoWars at InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:58:37.360 --> 3:58:41.240]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their
[3:58:41.240 --> 3:58:42.240]  control.
[3:58:42.240 --> 3:59:12.080]  That's what's prepared now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:59:42.240 --> 3:59:53.160]  This is InfoWars.com.
